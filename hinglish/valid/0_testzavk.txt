 ? In the list of Rudragams in the Srikanth Samhita, four names are higher than Raurav, Vimal, Visar and Saurabheda
 or usamen virakt, kauravy, makut evam aagney ye chaar naam nahin he
 Some people speculate that these Kauravas are Rauravas
 baaki teen inase bhinn hai
 Ashtadash Agam's name is not found anywhere
 isamen kiran, parmeshwar or raurav kaa naam he
 There is a treatise in Nepal written in the eighth century Gupta script called Ni Breath Tantra Samhita
 isamen loukik dharm, mul sutara, uttar sutara, nay sutara, guhya sutara ye paanch vibhaag hai
 The cosmic formula is often neglected
 baaki chaaron ke bheetar uttarasutra kaha jaataa he
 This answer sutra mentions 18 ancient Shiva sutras
 ye sab naam vastav main usee naam se prasiddh shivagam ke hi naam hai, yatha It has the names of 10 Shivantras, namely - Personnel, Yogaj, Divya, Reason, Ajit, Deept Micro, Sahasra Anshuman and Suprabheda
 brahmayamal 39 adhyay main ye naam paae jate hai - vijay, ni:shwaas, swyambhuv, babul, virbhadra, raurav, mukut, veeresh, chandragyaan, prodgit lalit, siddh santanak, sarvodgit, kiran or parameshwar 
 There are also 18 Tantras mentioned in Kamik Agam
 harprasad shastri ne ashtadash aagam kii prati nepal main dekhi thi jiskaa lipikaal 624 i0 main tha
 Bendal saheb says that Cambridge University Library has a hand written book of 895 AD named 'parmeshwar Agam'
 dow prabodhachandra bagchi kehete hai ki purvavarnit 'nayottar sutara' kaa rachanakaal chhathin se saatvin i0 ho saktaa he
 According to 'brahmayamal', the free breathing system originated from the middle source of Shiva and originated from the upper chest
 brahmayamal ke matanusaar nayottar sanmoh athwa shirishchhed vamastrot se udbhoot hai
 Jayadrathayamal also states that the Nayottara and Mahasammohan from Shirakhta - these three tantras originate from Shiva's balm source
 dwait or dwaitadvait shaiva aagam ati pracheen he, isamen andeh nahin
 But the form in which they meet and the way they are described in the Middle Ages, it is known that this form of it is not very ancient
 kaal bhed se vibhinn aitihaasik paristhitiyon ke kaaran aisa parivartan ho gaya he
 Nevertheless, it can be believed that the very ancient form of Pancharatra Agam, prevalent in the Middle Ages, as seen in the Mahabharata Shanti Parva, is equally probable about Shaivagam
 mahabharat ke moksh parv ke anusaar swayan shrikrishna ne dwait or dwaitadvait shaivagam kaa adhyayan upamanyu se kiya tha
 It is in the 'kamik Agam' that five of the five sources are related to the Panchamukhas of Sadasiva
 isiliye kul strot 25 hai
 The names of the five sources of the five faces are- paanch mukh is prakaar hai- According to 'soma Siddhanta' there are five types of cosmic system and Vedic also has five types
 in sab tantron main paraspar utkarsh yaa apakarsh kaa vichaar paaya jaataa he
 Accordingly, due to the distinction of the five directions vertically, there is a sequence of mechanisms
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki udhrv disha se nikle hue tantra sarvshereshth hai
 Then east, then north, west, then south
 is kram ke anusaar siddhantvid pandit log kaha karte hai ki siddhanthagyaan muktiprad hone ke kaaran sarvshereshth he
 According to its interchangeable serpent-destroying garuda gyan, omnipotent exponent kamgyan, preventive ph ghosts of ghosts, and the place of fai Bhairava tantra, useful for hostility should be known
 is prasang main or bhi ek baat jaananaa aavashyak he ki vaidic drushti se jaise sthoolt: gyaan ke do prakaar dikhaai dete hai- pratham 'bodh rup' or dwitiya 'shabd rup'
 Similarly two forms of knowledge are also found in Tantra literature
 yah kahana anaavashyak he ki bodhtmak gyaan shabdaatmak gyaan se shreshth he, is bodh rup gyaan ke vibhinn prakaar hai kyonki pratipaadya vishay ke bhed ke anusaar gyaan kaa bhedabhed hota he
 The knowledge that Shiva is the exponent of, the impersonal knowledge of animals and Maya is inferior
 isi liye shuddh maarg, ashuddh maarg, mishra maarg aadi bhedon se gyaan bhedon kii kalpana kii gai he
 Phonetic knowledge is called Phsha Shastra Ph
 isamen bhi parapar bhed hai
 According to the theorists, the principle knowledge is pure from Vedic knowledge, therefore it is excellent but there is a difference between principle knowledge as well
 isi prakaar diksharoop gyaan ke bhi kai avaantar bhed paae jate hai- naishthik, bhautik, nirbies, sabeej, loukik ityadi
 From this, it appears that even though there is one knowledge in the original, due to the subjective theme, the distinction appears in different forms
 'swyambhuv aagam' main kaha gaya he- In the 'kamik Agam' also, there are distinct differences between knowledge and knowledge
 isamen pratipaay vishay ke anusaar matigyaan paragyan or pashugyan athwa apper gyaan hai
 Shiva Prakashan knowledge is excellent
 pashupashadi arth prakaashan apper gyaan hai
 Similarly, there are various imaginations but both Shiva and Rudra are principles
 pashupat sampradaay ke acharya ashtadash rudragamon kaa pramanashya maanate the, parantu dash shiv gyaan kaa pramanay nahin maanate the
 The reason for this is that in Rudragam, a mixture of dvaita dishti and advata dishti is found
 parantu shivagam main advait drushti maani jaati isaliye acharya abhinay gupt ne kaha he ki pashupat darshan sarvatha hey nahin hai
 It is clearly shown in any scripture from which mouths of Shiva have come forth
 usase yah pratit hota hai ki kaamik, yogaj, chitya, karna or ajit ye paanch shivagam shiv ke sadhojaat mukh se nirgat hue the
 These five Sivagams, the lamps, the subtle, the Sahrutra, the Anshumat or the fractional differences have emanated from the mouth called Shiva's Bamdev
 vijay, ni:shwaas, swabhuv, aagney or vir ye paanch rudragam shiv ke aghor mukh se nirgat hue the
 Raurava, Mukut, Vimal Gyan, Chandrakant and Bib, these five rudragams were descended from Shiva's northern face
 prodgit, lalit, siddh, santan, vaatul, kirna, sarvocch or parameshwar ye aath rudragam shiv ke tatpurush mukh se nirgat hue the
 Thus the discussion of the proceeds appears in the 198 departments of Ashtavinshati Agam
 shrikanthi samhita main 64 bhairavagamon kaa nirdesh miltaa he
 These are the proponents of the Agama Adhaita theory

, four Tantras went from India to Kamboja
 unamem vinashikha, shirched or sanmoh ye teen grath purvekt suchi main vidyaman hai
 Nishtikha is pure scripture
 dow prabodhachandra bagchi ne vinashik ke naam se ise nirdisht kiya he
 This appears to be a corruption of the destruction chaturth pustak kaa naam nyyottar he
 
 dow bagchi samajhate hai ki nepal main 'nirishvaas tatv-samhita' kii jo hastlikhit pustak he or jiskaa vivaran nepal darbar kaitlog ke pratham khand main pri0 137 main diya gaya he vah ashtadash rudragam ke antargat nirishwaas tantra kaa hi namaatar he
 It has four parts or sutras
 sab milakar nayottar tantra naam se ye jane jate hai
 Lord Shankaracharya has written in Anand Lahiri Stotra- isamen kaha gaya he ki pashupati ne samgr vishwa ko tattat siddhipradarshak 64 tantra main kisi na kisi purusharth ko praapt karanevaali upasna kaa vivaran he
 In the end, he revealed the power-generating system of the only superpower to get the Yatva Purushartho together with Jagdamba's request
 aisa kaha gaya he ki saubhagyawardhini tikaa main is shloke kaa bhavarthanirupan is prakaar kiya gaya he- devi ne shankar se kaha ki tum aise tantra kii rachana karo jo ek hone par bhi sab prakaar ke purushartho kaa siddhidaayak ho
 On hearing the request of Devi, Shankar made light of the 'kadimatakhya' independent system
 or tantra paraspar saapeksh hai parantu yah tantra anyanirpeksh hone ke kaaran swatantra tantra ke rup main prasiddh he
 That is why in Tantric society it is considered as 'eternal system'
 tikaakar lakshmidhar ne kaha he ki is shloke kii pehali pankti main 'anusandhay' paath maanakar vichaar kiya gaya he
 But this does not seem appropriate
 unke matanusaar iskaa shuddh paath 'ati sandhay' he
 The term refers to 'deception'
 aisa maane par is shloke kaa taatpary yah hoga ki mahamaya ne sambar prabhruti 64 tantron ke dwaara vishvaprapanch ko dhokhaa diya he
 Each of them has a description of some or the other
 isiliye shankar se devi kaa vishesh anurodh yah tha ki ve sab purushartho ke sadhak ek tantra kaa nirmaan karen
 It is mainly 'bhagwati Tantra'
 'chatuhshashthitantr' kaa naam 'chatukshti' main he
 The speakers of these tantras are Shankar and the listener Parvati
 ye sab jagat kaa vinaash karanevaale or vaidic maarg se duurastha tantra hai
 This implies the interpretation of Lakshmidhar
 'arunamodini' tikaa lakshmidhar kii hi anugat he
 In this opinion, it is said in relation to the 65th Tantra that it is the 'mantrakshaya' of the Lord, who is superior to the combination of Shivshakti both varnas
 chatu:shatee main 64 tantron ke naam or unke upar 'saundaryalahari tikaa' main pradutt lakshmidhar kii vyakhya is prakaar he- No
 1-2 Mahamaya Tantra and Shambar Tantra: It contains details of Maya, Prapancha, creation
 iske prabhaav se drashtaa kii indriyaan tadnurup vishay ko grahan na kar anyaatha grahan karti hai
 As the object - it happens in the world, it is reflected near the seer - in a faint form

 - Yogini Jala Shambar: Mayapradhan Tantra is called Shambar
 isamen yoginiyon kaa jaal dikhaai detaa he
 For the practitioner of this, one has to follow the rules specified in the cremation ground
 tatvashankar- yah ' mahendra jaal vidya ' he
 By this one element can be treated as another element; Like water element in earth element or earth element in water element
 5-12 siddh bhairav, batuka bhairav, kankal bhairav, kaal bhairav, kalagni bhairav, yogini bhairav, maha bhairav tathaa shakti bhairav

 ye sab tantra avaidic hai
 13-20 polymorphic, Brahmi, Maheshwari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Chamuda, Shwiduti,
 ye sabhi shakti se udbhoot maatrakaa rup hai
 Eight tantras were written about these eight maternal aunts
 lakshmidhar ke anusaar ye sab avaidic hai
 Incidentally, due to the incident of Shri Vidya, it is not available for Vedic seekers
 21-28 yamalashtak: yamla shabd kaa taatpary he kaayasiddh amba
 Yamalasiddhi is described in eight tantras
 yah bhi avaidic tantra he
 16- Chandra Gyan: 16 Vidyas have been rendered in this Tantra
 phir bhi yah kapalik mat hone ke kaaran hey he
 There is also a Vedic-learning scripture called Chandragyan but it is outside the four-dimensional system
 30-malini vidya: isamen samudryaan kaa vivaran he
 It is also unethical
 31-mahasammohan: jaagrath manushya ko supt yak achetan karne kii vidya
 This is proved by measures like Baal Jihyabhed, hence hey
 32-36-vamayupt tantra : mahadev tantra, vaatul tantra, vaatulotar tantra, kaamik tantra, ye sab mishra tantra hai
 Vedic sayings are found in one or the other parts of them, but most of them are non-vedic
 37-hridbhed tantra or guhyatantr: isamen gupt rup se prakruti tantra kaa bhed varnit hua he
 In the ritual of this learning, there is a variety of violent incidents, so it is unethical
 40 -kalawaad: isamen chandrakalaon ke pratipadak vishay hai kaam, purushaarth hone par bhikala grahan or moksh das sthaan kaa grahan or chandrakala saurabh prabhruti kaa upyog purushaarth rup main kamya nahin he
 Except this, the teachings of the prohibited ethos are in this book
 iskaa nishiddhansh kapalik na hone par bhi hey he
 41-kalasar: In this, the remedy for the consummation of Karna is described
 is tantra main vamachar kaa praadhanya he
 142-kundika Mat: It describes Gutikasiddhi
 isamen bhi vamachar kaa praadhanya he
 43-matot Mat: There is a discussion of rasasiddhi
 44-vinyakhyartatra: tinaya ek vishesh yogini kaa naam he
 In this book, a solution is given to prove this Yagini
 kisi kisi ke mat se vinaya yogini nahin hai; sambhogayakshini kaa hi naam vinnaya he
 45-tortal system: It has details of esophagus and padukasiddhi
 46-trotalotar tantra: isamen 64,000 yakshiniyon ke darshan kaa upaay varnit he
 47-panchamrit: The subject of how the Earth Prabhriti Panchabhutas can be possible in the posthumous body, adam
 yah bhi kapalik granth he
 48-52 Rupbheda, Bhootdamar, Kulasar, Kuloddish, Kulchudamani, these five tantras describe the measures to kill the enemy with the use of mantras
 yah bhi avaidic granth he
 53-57 Sarvagyanottara, Mahakali Mat, Arunosh, Madnish, Vikuntheshwar, these five tantras are the texts of the 'digambara' sect
 yah sampradaay kapalik sampradaay kaa bhed he
 58-64 East, West, Uttar, South, Nirutar, Vimal, Vimalotar and Devimat These are the texts of 'chhapanak sect'
 purvakt sakshipt vivaran se pataa chalata he ki ye 64 tantra hi jaagtik siddhi athwa fallabh ke liye hai
 There is no way to achieve any kind of economic welfare
 lakshmidhar ke matanusaar ye sabhi avaidic hai
 In this context, Lakshmidhar has said that Paramakalyanik Parmeshwar unconstrained such systems, this is a question
 iskaa samaadhaan karne ke liye unhone kaha he ki pashupati ne brahman aadi chaar varna or mamurdhabhishikt prabhruti anulom, pratilom sab manushyon ke liye tantrashastra kii rachana kii thi
 In this also, not everyone has authority in all the systems
 brahman aadi teen varnon kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 Regime is different from rights
 pehle jo chandrakala vidya kii baat kahi gai he vah 'chandrakala vigyaan' se bhinn he
 'chandrakala Vidya' includes Chandrakala, Jayotsnavati, Kularnava, Kulashri, Bhuvaneshwari, Barhaspatya Durvasamat and all these tantras which have the rights of three varnas, but the ritual of rituals in the subject of Trivarna is from South Way
 shudron kaa bhi adhikaar he parantu unke anushtanka vidhaan vam maarg main he
 In this discipline, coordination of time and time is seen
 shubhagam panchak- ye paanch aagam samay maarg ke antargat hai
 These names are - Vasistha Samhita, Sanak Samhita, Sanandan Samhita, Shukasamhita Sanatkumar Samhita
 ye sab vaidic margshwayi he
 Vasisthadi five monks are the exhibitors of this path
 iskaa pravartan 'samayaachaar' ke aadhaar par hua tha
 Lakshmidhar says that Shankaracharya used to follow his own time
 shubhagam panchak shuddh samay maarg kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Ten of the Shodash Vidyas have been rendered by accepting the original knowledge
 isaliye ise 'ang vidya' ke rup main grahan kiya jaataa he
 But under Chandrashna Vidya, it is considered to be the predominance of Shodash schools
 isaliye ise 'kaulmarg' kaha jaataa he
 The independent system that has been talked about earlier - which is mentioned in 'beautylahiri' - has been said in Bhaskar Rai's 'setubandh' about it that it can be 'left-wing'
 nityashedsharnav is tantra ke hi antarbhukt he
 Gautikot, commentator of Beautylhari said that in addition to 64 tantra, he has a friend, he may be 'gyanarnava' but according to the other sect, independent adjective appears to indicate a specific system called 'tantraraj'
 todalatantr main 64 tantron ke naam die gaye hai
 It is expedient to consider this name list as modern
 sarvanand ne apane 'sarvollas tantra' main 'todal tantra' ke ye naam die hai
 The criticism of this list shows that it is unique not only from the list of quadrupeds, but also from the list of 'srikanthi'
 sarvollasoddhrut tadalatantr main jo suchi milti he vah is prakaar he- kaali, mundamala, tara, tanrvan, shivsar, vir nidashrn, latarchan, taul, nil, radha, vidyasar, bhairav, bhairavi, siddheshwar, maatrubhed, samaya, guptasadhak, maaya, mahamaya, akshaya, kumari, kularnav, kalikaculsarvasv, kalikakala, vaarahi, yogini, yoginihruday, sanatakoomar, tripurasaar, yogininijay, malini, kukkut, shriganesh, bhoot, uddish, kamdhenu, utar, virbhadra, vamakeshwar, kulchudabhani, bhavachudamani, gnanarnav, varada, tantraintamani, virunivilas, hansatutra, chidambaratantr, shwetvaridh, nitya, utraa, narayani, jnyandeep, gautamiya, tanrutar, garjan, kubjika, tatramunktavali, brihdashrikram, swatantrayoni, mayakhya
 In the second chapter of Dasharthi Tantra, 64 Tantras are mentioned
 yah suchi pehali se kuch bhinn he
 There is a handwritten book by Dasharathi Tantra in India Office Library, London, written in 1676 words ie 1754 AD
 harivansh main likhaa he ki shrikrishna ne 64 advaitatantron kaa durvasa ke nikat adhyayan kiya tha
 
 aisi prasiddhi he ki durvasa hi kaliyug main advait tantra naamak granth tantrasahitya ke vishay main kaaphi suchnaayen detaa he
 In its 41st chapter it is said that Yamal is of eight types - the origin of these eight is Brahma Yamal

 Eric Williams
 lekin donon hi ne sangheey chunaav nahin ladaa or apane sambandhit dweep ke niyantran ko banaae rakhane ko pasand kiya
 This meant that the leaders of the two most important provinces did not see the Union as viable
 isi tarah, dlapi ke jamcon sansthaapak alexander bastamante ne bhi sangh ke chunaav ke liye manaa kar diya or trinidadian eshford sinanan ke liye party netritv chhod diya

 Antigua's Prime Minister Ware Bird replied that his province in the Union is an equal share of Trinidad, not like "a little Tobago"

 However, these talks ultimately proved fruitless

 Gandhi lived in Mani Bhavan in Mumbai
 vahaan 20 july 1921 ko gandhi ji or subhash ke bich pehali mulaakaat hui
 Gandhiji advised him to go to Kolkata and work with Dasbabu
 iske baad subhash kolkata aakar dasababu se mili
 In those days Gandhiji started a non-cooperation movement against the British government
 dasababu is aandolan kaa bengal main netritv kar rahe the
 Subhash joined them in this movement
 1922 main dasababu ne congress ke antargat swaraj party kii sthapana kii
 Swaraj Party contested the election of Kolkata Mahapalika to oppose the British government from inside the assembly and Dasbabu became the Mayor of Kolkata
 unhone subhash ko mahapalika kaa pramukh kaaryakari adhikari banaaya
 During his tenure, Subhash changed the entire structure and way of working of Kolkata Mahapalika
 kolkata main sabhi raaston ke angrezi naam badalakar unhen bhartiya naam diye gayi
 Families of those who gave up their lives in the freedom struggle started getting jobs in the Mahapalika
 bahut jald hi subhash desh ke ek mahatvapurn yuva netaa ban gayi
 Subhash along with Jawaharlal Nehru started the Independence League of Youth under the Congress
 1928 main jab simon kamishan bharat aayaa tab congress ne use kaale jhande dikhaaye
 Subhash led this movement in Kolkata
 simon kamishan ko jawaab dene ke liye congress ne bharat kaa bhavi samvidhan banane kaa kaam aath sadasyeey ayog ko saunpa
 Motilal Nehru was the chairman of this commission and Subhash was a member of it
 is ayog ne nehru report pesh kii
 In 1928, the annual Congress session was held in Kolkata under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 is adhiveshan main subhash ne khaaki ganavesh dhaaran karke motilal nehru ko sainya tareeke se salaami di
 Gandhiji did not agree with the demand for complete self-rule in those days
 is adhiveshan main unhone angrez sarkaar se dominian states maangane kii thaan lee thi
 But Subhash Babu and Jawaharlal Nehru did not agree to retreat from the demand of complete Swaraj
 ant main yah tay kiya gaya ki angrez sarkaar ko dominian states dene ke liye ek saal kaa vakt diya jaye
 If the British government did not meet this demand in a year, the Congress would demand full Swaraj
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii
 Therefore, in 1930, when the annual Congress session was held in Lahore under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, it was decided that 26 January would be celebrated as Independence Day
 26 janvari 1931 ko kolkata main raashtra dhvaj fahraakar subhash ek vishaal morche kaa netritv kar rahe the tabhi police ne un par lathi chalaayi or unhen ghayal kar jail bhej diya
 While Subhash was in jail, Gandhiji compromised with the British government and got all the prisoners released
 lekin angrej sarkaar ne bhagat singh jaise krantikariyon ko reeha karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Gandhiji spoke to the government to forgive Bhagat Singh's execution, but with tenderness
 subhash chaahate the ki is vishay par gandhiji angrej sarkaar ke saath kiya gaya samjhauta tod den
 But Gandhiji was not ready to break his promise
 angrej sarkaar apane sthaan par adi rahi or bhagat singh va unke saathiyon ko phaansi de di gayi
 Subhash Gandhi became very angry with Gandhi and Congress methods for not saving Bhagat Singh
 apane saarvajanik jivan main subhash ko kul 11 baar karawas hua
 First he was imprisoned for six months on 16 July 1921
 1925 main gopinath saaha naamak ek krantikari kolkata ke police adheekshak charlas tegart ko maarna chahta tha
 He accidentally killed a businessman named Ernest Day
 iske liye use phaansi kii sajaa di gayi
 Subhash wept bitterly after Gopinath was hanged
 unhone gopinath kaa shav mangekar uskaa antim sanskaar kiya
 This led the British government to conclude that Subhash not only had connections with fiery revolutionaries, but he also inspired them
 isi bahaane angrez sarkaar ne subhash ko giraftaar kiya or bina koi mukadmaa chalaaye unhen anishchit kaal ke liye myanmaar ke mandle karagrih main bandi banaakar bhej diya
 On 5 November 1925 Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das died in Kolkata
 subhash ne unki mrityu kii khabar mandle karagrih main radio par suni
 While staying at Mandalay prison, Subhash got very sick
 unhen tapedic ho gaya
 But the British government still refused to release him
 sarkaar ne unhen reeha karne ke liye yah shart rakhi ki ve ilaaj ke liye europe chale jaayen
 But the government did not clarify when they could return to India after treatment
 isliye subhash ne yah shart sweekaar nahin kii
 Eventually, the situation became so difficult that the jail authorities began to feel that they might not die in prison
 angrez sarkaar yah khatra bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi ki subhash kii karagrih main mrityu ho jaye
 Therefore, the government released him
 uske baad subhash ilaaj ke liye dalhousie chale gayi
 Subhash was in imprisonment in 1930 when he was elected the Mayor of Kolkata in the elections
 isliye sarkaar unhen reeha karne par majaboor ho gayi
 Subhash was again imprisoned in 1932
 is baar unhen almoda jail main rakhaa gaya
 His health deteriorated again in Almora jail
 chikitsakon kii salaah par subhash is baar ilaaj ke liye europe jane ko raji ho gayi
 Subhash lived in Europe from 1933 to 1936
 europe main subhash ne apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhte hue apana kaary badastoor jari rakhaa
 There he met Mussolini, the leader of Italy, who pledged to assist him in India's freedom struggle
 ireland ke netaa di valera subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 The days when Subhash was in Europe, Kamala Nehru, wife of Jawaharlal Nehru, died in Austria
 subhash ne vahaan jaakar jawaharlal nehru ko santvana di
 Subhash later met Vitthal Bhai Patel in Europe
 vitthal bhai patel ke saath subhash ne mantranaa kii jise patel-bose vishleshan ke naam se prasiddhi mili
 In this analysis, both of them strongly condemned Gandhi's leadership
 uske baad vitthal bhai patel jab biimaar ho gayi to subhash ne unki bahut seva kii
 But Vitthal Bhai Patel did not survive, he died
 vitthal bhai patel ne apni vasiyat main apni sari sampatti subhash ke naam kar di
 But after his death, his brother Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not accept this will
 sardaar patel ne is vasiyat ko lekar adaalat main mukadmaa chalaaya
 On winning this case, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gifted all of his brother's property to the Harijan service of Gandhi
 1934 main subhash ko unke pita ke mrityushyya par hone kii khabar mili
 As soon as he heard the news, he returned to Kolkata via airplane via Karachi
 yadhyapi karachi main hi unhe pataa chal gaya tha ki unke pita kii mrittyu ho chuki he phir bhi ve kolkata gayi
 As soon as he reached Kolkata, the British government arrested him and kept him in jail for several days and sent him back to Europe
 san 1934 main jab subhash austria main apana ilaaj karaane hetu tehre hue the us samay unhen apni pustak likhane hetu ek angreji jaanane vaale typist kii aavashyaktaa hui
 a friend of his met an Austrian woman named Emily Shankel
 emily ke pita ek prasiddh pashu chikitsak the
 Subhash was attracted to Emily and the two fell in natural love
 naaji germany ke sakht kanoonon ko dekhte hue un donon ne san 1942 main bad gastin naamak sthaan par hindu paddati se vivaah rachaa liya
 Emily gave birth to a daughter in Vienna
 subhash ne use pehali baar tab dekha jab vah mushkil se chaar saptaah kii thi
 They named her Anita Bose
 agast 1945 main taiwan main hui tathakthith vimaan durghatana main jab subhash kii maut hui, anita paune teen saal kii thi
 Anita is still alive
 uskaa naam anita bose phalf he
 Anita Faf sometimes comes to India to meet her father's family
 1938 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan haripura main hona tay hua
 Prior to this session, Gandhi chose Subhash for the post of Congress President
 yah congress kaa 51 vaan adhiveshan tha
 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili
 He announced that now that India has a golden opportunity, it should intensify its campaign for liberation
 8 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh ke prati party kaa rukh tay karne ke liye subhash ko vishesh aamantrit ke rup main congress kaary samiti main bulaayaa gaya
 He also reiterated with his opinion that if the Congress cannot do this work, the forward block will start a war against the British Raj on its own
 agle hi varsh july main kalakatta sthit halwat stambh jo bharat kii gulaami kaa pratik tha subhash kii youth brigade ne ratorat vah stambh mitti main mila diya
 Subhash's volunteers uprooted each brick of his foundation
 yah ek pratikatmak shuruyaat thi
 Through this, Subhash had given the message that as he has mixed this column in the dust, in the same way, he will also play brick by brick of the British Empire
 iske parinamswaroop angrej sarkaar ne subhash sahit forward block ke sabhi mukhya netaaon ko kaid kar liya
 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police
 sharadbabu ke bade bete shishir ne unhe apni gaadi se kolkata se dur gomoh tak pahunchaaya
 They reached Peshawar after catching a frontier mail from Gomoh railway station
 peshawar main unhen forward block ke ek sahakaari, miyaan akbar shah mili
 Mian Akbar Shah met him with Bhagatram Talwar of Kirti Kisan Party
 bhagatraam talwaar ke saath subhash peshawar se afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ore nikal pade
 In this journey, Pathan and Subhash named Bhagatram Talwar Rahmat Khan became his deaf and dumb deaf
 pahadiyon main paidal chalate hue unhone yah safar puraa kiya
 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him
 aakhir main arlando mazonta naamak italian vyakti banakar subhash kabul se nikalakar rus kii rajdhani masco hote hue germany kii rajdhani berlin pahunche
 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay kinhin bhi do deshon kii nausenaon kii pandubbiyon ke dwaara nagarikon kii yah ekmaatr adla-badali hui thi
 This Japanese submarine brought them to Padang Port in Indonesia
 purvi asia pahunchakar subhash ne sarvapratham vayovruddh krantikari rasbihari bose se bhartiya swatantrata parishad kaa netritv sanbhaala
 Rasbihari voluntarily handed over the leadership of the Freedom Council to Subhash in Singapore's Edward Park
 japan ke pradhanmantri general hideki tojo ne netaji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar unhen sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan
 21 oktober 1943 ke din netaji ne singapore main arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind kii sthapana kii
 He himself became the President, Prime Minister and War Minister of this government
 is sarkaar ko kul nau deshon ne manyata di
 Netaji also became the chief commander of the Azad Hind Fauj
 azaad hind fouj main japani sena ne angrejon kii fouj se pakade hue bhartiya yudhbandiyon ko bhartee kiya tha
 The Rani Regiment of Jhansi was also formed for women in Azad Hind Fauj
 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 Japanese general Shodei, Pilate, and some others aboard the plane were killed
 netaji gambheer rup se jal gayi the
 He was rushed to Taihoku military hospital where he succumbed
 karnal habiburrahman ke anusaar unka antim sanskaar taihoku main hi kar diya gaya
 In mid-september, their bones were collected and placed in the Rankoji temple of Tokyo, the capital of Japan
 bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar se praapt dastauez ke anusaar netaji kii mrityu 18 agast 1945 ko taihoku ke sainik aspataal main raatri 21
00 baje hui thi
 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country
 faijabad ke gumnami baba se lekar chhattisgarh rajya main jila raigarh tak main netaji ke hone ko lekar kai daawey pesh kiye gayi lekin in sabhi kii pramanikta sandigdh he
 In Chhattisgarh, the case of Subhash Chandra Bose went to the state government
 parantu rajya sarkaar ne ise hastkshep ke yogya na maanate hue maamle kii file hi band kar di
 The Calcutta High Court has ordered the formation of a special bench to hear the demand to make the intelligence documents related to the mystery of Netaji's disappearance public
 yah yachika sarkari sanghathan indiaj smil dwaara daayar kii gayi he
 Many others including the Union of India, National Advisory Council, RAW, Intelligence Department, Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Defense Secretary, Home Department and the Government of West Bengal have been made defendants in this petition
 hiroshima or nagasaki ke vidhwans ke baad saare sandarbh hi badal gayi
 After surrender, Japan kept groaning under America's feet for four-five years
 yahi kaaran tha ki netaji or aaazaad hind sena kaa romaharshak itihaas tokio ke abhilekhaagaar main varshon tak padaa dhul khaataa rahaa
 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity
 angrejon ke dwaara kiye gayi vidhivat dushprachaar tathaa tatkaaleen pramukh raajnneetik dalon dwaara subhash ke virodh ke baavjood saare desh ko jhakzor denevaale us mukademe ke baad matayen apane beton ko ‘subhash’ kaa naam dene main garv kaa anubhav karne lageen
 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this
 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country
 jahaan swatantrata se purv videshi shaasha netaji kii samarthy se ghabaraate rahe, to swatantrata ke uparant deshi sattadhish janamanas par unke vyaktitv or kartrutv ke amit prabhaav se ghabaraate rahe
 Swatantraveer Savarkar organized a conference of revolutionaries after independence and placed Netaji's oil painting on the seat of the Speaker
 yah ek krantivir dwaara duusare kranti vir ko di gayi abhootpurv salaami thi
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha
 This book became very famous
 unki aatmakatha yadhyapi apurna hi rahi, lekin use purna karne kii unki abhilaashaa rahi thi, jiskaa pataa mul pandulipi ke pratham prishth par banaayi gayi yojana se spasht roopen chalata he
 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke sankalan evam prakaashan kaary se aarambh se hi sugat bose bhi jude hue the or antim do khandon kaa prakaashan dow0 shishir kumaar bose ke dukhad nidhan ke kaaran mukhyatah sugat bose ke hi sampadan main hua
 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that like Mahatma Gandhi, in the context of Netaji too, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed
 vaise to mahatma gandhi ke anuyaayiyon evam shishyon kii sankhya anginat he

 free software
 yadi software ke liye paisa nahin milegaa to kaam kaise chalegaa| tab vyapaaree varg ko aisa laga ki free software bekaar he or unhone ise apane se bahut dur rakhaa
 Although money can also be earned from free software, but its method is somewhat different, but there was such a stampede on the free software that the business class started shying away from adopting those other methods too

 There is a difference between the two, but the relationship is also deep
 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part

 The goldfish is a freshwater fish in the family of Cyprinidae in the order of Cypriniformes
 yah paaltu banaae jane vaali sabase pehali machhlee he or sabase adhik rakhe jane vaali equarium machhlee he
 It is a relatively small member of the carp family, a domesticated version of the goldfish dark-gray / olive / brown carp native to East Asia and identified in Europe in the first half of the 17th century
 The mutation that gave birth to the goldfish is also known to be caused by other cyprinid species such as common carp and tench
 paaltu sunaharimachhlee kii kai alag alag kismein hai
 Goldfish grow to maximum length: In to cm length and have a maximum weight of 9
9 pounds, however, this is rare; Most individual goldfish are smaller than half the size
 ishtatam paristhitiyon main, sunaharimachhlee 40 varshon se bhi adhik samay tak jivit rahati hai; haalanki, adhiktar gharelu sunaharimchaliyaan aam taur par chah se aath varshon tak jivit rahati hai
 In ancient China, various species of carp were domesticated and reared as edible fish for thousands of years
 iname se kuch saamanytah grey or chaandi ke rang kii prajatiyon, kii pravriti hoti he ki ve laal, naarangi, yaa pile rang kii utparivartan karte hai; yah pratham baar jin rajvansh main darj kiya gaya
 During the Tang dynasty, carp rearing was popular in ornamental ponds and inundations

 People started breeding golden colored fish instead of silver colored species by keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water
 On special occasions, when guests were expected to arrive, they were transferred in fairly small letters for display

 is samay tak, pilaa shahi rang hone ke kaaran, shahi parivaar ke baahar, logon ke liye sunahari kism kii machhliyon ko rakhana varjit tha
 This is probably why orange goldfish are found in greater numbers than yellow goldfish, despite that yellow goldfish are genetically easier to breed

 sunaharimachhlee ke kuch charam sanskaran equarium" main hi rahete hai- ve junglee kismon se kahi kam majboot hote hai
 However, some varieties are more robust such as Shubankin
 The main varieties are: chini parampara sunaharimchhaliyon ko mukhya rup se 4 prakaar main vargeekrut karti he
 This classification is not commonly used in the West
 sunaharimachhlee lokapriy talab machhliyaan hai, kyonki ve chote, saste, rangeen or bahut saahsee hote hai
 In an outdoor pond or water garden, they probably survive for a brief period even if the ice is frozen on the surface, until water is present in sufficient quantities of oxygen and the pond is not completely frozen
 Common goldfish, London and Bristol Shubankins, Jikin, Walkin, Komet and some hardy phantail goldfish can be kept in a pond throughout the year in temperate and subtropical climates
 moore, weltel, oranda or linhed ko bahari talabon main keval garmiyon main or adhik ushnkaribandheey mausam main hi surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Everything from small to large ponds is fine for this, although the depth should be at least Cm to in order to keep from freezing
 During winter, goldfish become lethargic, stop eating and often stay at the bottom of the pond
 yah puri tarah se saamaanya he; or ve vasant main phir se sakriy ho jate hai
 a filter is important to keep the pond clean and clear the waste
 paudhe aavashyak hai kyonki ve nispandan pranali ke bhaag ke rup main or saath hi machhlee ke liye ek khaadya strot ke rup main kaary karte hai
 Plants are further beneficial because they increase oxygen levels in water

 For mango and comet varieties, each goldfish should have 20 US gallons of water
 There should be 10 US gallons of water for ornamental goldfish
 The surface area of water determines how much oxygen percolates and dissolves in the water

 Goldfish are classified as a cold water fish and can live in an aquarium without heating, at a temperature that is sufficient for humans
 haalanki, taapmaana main teji se badlaav unhen maar saktaa he, khaskar agar tanks choti he
 Care should also be taken when adding water, as the temperature of the water being mixed will be different
 10 ° c Temperatures below k can be dangerous for other ornamental varieties, while mango and comet fishes can survive even at very low temperatures
 atyant ucch taapmaana se upar sunaharimachhlee ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 However, high temperatures can help destroy protozoa suffering by accelerating the life cycle of the parasite - thus destroying it more intensely
 sunaharimachhlee ke liye ishtatam taapmaana 20 °se
 or 22 °se
 ke bich he
 Like all fish, goldfish do not like to be domesticated
 vastav main, ek sunaharimachhlee ko chhun uske swasthya ko khatre main daal saktaa he, kyonki isse unke par bani surakshatmak patali jhilli kshatigrast ho sakati he yaa hat sakati he, jiske parinaam swaroop machhlee kii twachaa bacteria se sankraman yaa pani main janme parjiviyon ke prati ujagar ho jaati he
 However, the goldfish reacts to the human being at the time of eating and can be trained to take pills or microscopic pieces from the human fingers
 sunaharimachhlee ke sheeghra marajaane ke liye kharaab dekhbhaal ko zimmedaar tehraaya gaya he
 The life cycle of a goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years
 yadi ek avadhi tak andhere main chhod diya jaae, to sunahari machhlee dhire-dhire apana rang badalati he jab tak kii vah puri tarah se grey rang kii nahin ho jaati
 sunaharimachhlee suraj kii roshni ke pratikriya main rangadravya utpaadit karti he, thik usee tarah se jaise maanav twachaa dhoop se tapt ho jaati he
 Fish have cells called chromatophores that produce pigments that reflect light and give the fish its color
 ek sunaharimachhlee kaa rang is baat se tay hota he ki uski koshikaon main koun se rangadravya hai, kitne rangadravya anu vahaan maujuud he or rangadravya koshika ke bheetar samooh main he yaa pure cytoplasm main faile hue he
 In wild environments, their diet includes hardy animals, pests and various plant foods
 ve sarvahari hote hai or ek pradhan parat yaa goli ke poorak aahaar ke sthaan par vibhinn prakaar ke taaja falon or subjiyon se apana kaam acchhee tarah se chalaa sakate hai
 Like most other fish, goldfish is an opportunistic eater and does not give up food as per its opinion
 When additional food is available, they produce more waste and feces, partly due to protein indigestion
 Sometimes a fish fecal tube called a cloaca can be detected by looking at the feces hanging from the back
 sunaharimachhlee ko utani hi maatra main bhojan khilaaen jitani ki vah teen se chaar minute main khatm kar sake or vah bhi din main do baar se adhik nahin
 atirikt aahaaran ghaatak siddh ho saktaa he, khaas kar aanton ko avaruddh karke yaa faad ke
 yah praayah sunaharimachhlee kii chuninda nasl ke saath hi hota he, jisaki aant ghumaavdaar hoti he
 Those fish that have new Ryukin, Fantail, Oranda, Lionhead or other ornamental goldfish will have to decide carefully how much they are needed
 sunaharimachhlee ke vishesh aahaar main aam machhlee aahaar kii tulan protein kii maatra kam or carbohydrate kii maatra adhik hoti he
 It comes in two forms - flattened microbes that float on water and bullets that drown
 utsaahi log is aahaar ke sthaan par chhilake vaale matar, rang nikaale hue hare patteydaar sabjiyan or bldwarm kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Young goldfish benefit from the addition of salted shrimp to their diet
 jaisaa ki sabhi jaanwaron ke saath hota he, sunaharimchhaliyon kii bhi pasand badalati hai
 Ornamental goldfish cannot survive in wild environments due to the dark colors of their feathers; However, fishes of adventurous varieties like Shubankin can live long and breed with their wild relatives
 aam or comet sunaharimchaliyaan ek talab ke liye upyukt kisi bhi mausam main na keval jivit rah sakati hai, balki falti bhi hai
 Introduction of wild goldfish can cause problems for the species living there
 teen pidiyon ke prajnan ke bheetar bahut bade panaame par sunaharimachhlee kaa and samooh apane prakritik jaitoon jaise hare rang main punah parivartit ho jaati he
 Goldfish can hybridize with some other species of carp
 kuch vishesh antar hai jo yah darshata he ki prashia carp sunahari machhliyon ke vanshaj hone ke baavjood unamem itnaa fark yaa algaav he ki ve do alag-alag prajatiyaan maani ja sakate hai
 Behavior can vary widely for two reasons, because goldfish live in different environments and also because their behavior can be adapted by their owners
 sunaharimachhlee main saahchary seekhney or saamaajik kaushal seekhney kii kshamta prabal hoti he
 Furthermore, his visual acuity helps him to distinguish between humans
 machhliyon ke maalikon ne yah dhyaan diya hoga ki machhliiyaan unke prati anukool pratikriya karti he jabaki anya logon ke tanks ke paas jane se ve chuphi rahati he
 Over time, goldfish learn to associate themselves with their owner and others in relation to food and whenever their owners come to them they "beg" for food
 ek andhi sunaharimachhlee ke pratikriya ne yah sabit kar diya ki vah parivaar ke ek vishesh sadsy or ek dost ko uski awaz yaa dhwani kampan se pahchaan letaa he
 This behavior was notable, as it showed that the fish recognized only the sound waves of only two of the seven members of the house
 sunaharimachhlee yuthchari hoti hai, jo schuli vyavhaar pradarshit karti he or saath hi saath usee prakaar kaa aahaar vyavhaar bhi pradarshit karti he
 The goldfish exhibits a similar reaction by looking at its image in the mirror
 sunaharimachhlee jinka manushyon ke saath lagaataar drushti sampark bana rahata he unhen apane liye khatra maananaa bhi band kar dete hai
 After being kept in a tank for several weeks, sometimes for months, it is possible to feed a goldfish away without blushing, with hands
 sunaharimachhlee ne samoohon or vyaktiyon donon ke rup main vyavhaar siikhaa he, jo sthaneey carp ke vyavhaar se utpann hui he
 They are living species under any circumstances, whose varied food, breeding and predatory avoidance behavior contributed to their success
 machhlee ke rup main ve ek dusre ke prati "dostana" kah kar varnit kiye ja sakate hai
 Rarely, one goldfish damages another goldfish and neither male fish harms the female fish during breeding
 ek maatr vaastavik khatra jo sunaharimachhlee ek duusare ko pahunchaate hai vah he bhojan ke liye pratispardhaa
 khilaane kii prakriya ke dauraan aam, comet or anya tej kismein jaldi se sara aahaar kha jaati hai isse pehle ki sajaavati kismein us tak pahunch sake
 iske kaaran adhik sajaavati kismein avaruddh vikaas or bhukhmaree kaa shikaar ho sakati hai jab ve ek hi talab main apane ikhare-poonch vaale bhaiyon ke saath rakhi jaati he
 As a result, care should be taken that only breeds with the same type of body texture and characteristics of swimming are kept together
 sunaharimachhleeyon ko sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran kaa upyog karke vibhinn rangon ke prakaash sanketon ko pahchaanana or un par pratikriya karne ke liye prashikshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The goldfish has a memory duration of at least three months and can distinguish between different sizes, colors and sounds
 ek or prayog ne 1 maheene se adhik avadhi tak yaad rakhane kii avdhaaran kaa pradarshan kiya
 Fish react to certain colors related to food
 machhliiyaan bhojan die jane ke samay kaa purvanumaan karnaa sikh jaati hai basharte ki bhojan rose lagbhag ek hi samay par diya jaae
 sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran vaale prashikshan takneekein kaa upyog karke sikhaaye jane par, sunaharimchaliyaan kuch kartab bhi sikhti hai, jaise limbo, slalam, fech or sokar
 Goldfish live in ponds and other slow or stagnant bodies of water, where the water depth is 20 meters
 Their basic climate ranges from subtropical to tropical and they live in Tazepani with ph 6
8–8
0 and hardness 5
0–19
0 dgh
 ve 40–106 °fai taapmaana main bhi jivit rah sakate hai, haalanki ucch taapmaana ve keval ek sankshipt samay tak hi rah sakate he
 They are not adapted to live in a warm tropical fish tank, and they prefer the concentration of oxygen in unheated tanks, some believing that heat burns them
 haalanki, sunaharimachhlee bahari talabon main rah sakati he jisamen taapmaana aksar 86 °fai se upar pahunch jaati he
 a sudden change in water temperature can prove harmful to any fish, including a goldfish
 ek duukaan se kharidi hui sunaharimachhlee ko talab yaa tanks main sthanantarit karte samay, sunahari machhlee ko chhodane se pehle, parivahan container ko gantavy container main kam se kam 20 minute tak rakhkar unke taapmaana ko baraabar kar liya janaa chahie
 yadi taapmaana parivartan main adhik antar he, jaise kamare ke taapmaana 21 °se
 se ek thande bagichaa talab 4 °se
 main, tab sankraman dinon yaa hafton tak badhaayaa janaa chahie
 Because goldfish eat living plants, their presence in a plant planted aquarium can be problematic
 keval kuch hi equarium paudhon kii prajatiyaan udhaaharan ke liekryptocorin or anubias, sunahari machhlee ke aas paas jivit rah sakati hai, lekin is baat par vishesh dhyaan dene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki ve jad se naa ukhaade jaae
 plastic paudhe praayah adhik tikaoo hote hai, lekin unki shakhaaen machhliyon ko chune par unhen pareshaan kar sakati hai yaa nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 Goldfish can develop sexual maturity only with adequate water and proper nutrition
 adhiktar sunaharimchaliyaan kaid main hi prajnan karti hai, vishesh rup se talab vyavastha main
 acchhee tarah se rakhe jane par, ve ghar ke andar bhi prajnan kar sakate hai, lekin ek chote machhlee prapaat main nahin
 prajnan aamtaur par taapmaana main ek mahatvapurn parivartan ke baad praayah vasant ritu main hota he
 Males chase females and provoke them to release eggs by pushing and killing them
 sabhi siprineed kii tarah sunahari machhliyaan bhi andey detii hai
 Their eggs are clingy and stick to aquatic vegetation, especially with dense plants such as Cabomba or Allodia or a swaning mop
 In captivity, eggs must be removed in a separate tank, as adult fishes eat smaller fishes when encountered
