 paaritantr yaa paristhitik tantra ek prakritik ikai he jisamen ek kshetra vishesh ke sabhi jeevadharee, arthath paudhe, jaanavar or anujiv shaamil hai jo ki apane ajaev paryaavaran ke saath antarkriya karke ek sampoorn jaivik ikai banaate hai
 Thus ecosystems are a unit of interdependent components that divide the same habitat
 paaritantr aamtaur anek khaadya jaal banaate hai jo paristhitiki tantra ke bheetar in jeevon ke anyonyashray or urja ke pravaah ko dikhaate hai
 The term ecosystem was coined in 1930 by Roy Clapham to denote the combined physical and biological components of an environment
 british paristhitivigyaanshasri arthur tansle ne baad main, is shabd ko parishkrut karte hue yah varnan diya "yah puri pranali


 na keval jeev-parisar he, lekin vah sabhi bhautik karkon kaa puraa parisar bhi shaamil hai jise ham paryaavaran kehete hai"
 Tansley considered ecosystems not only as natural units, but also as "mental isolates"
 tansle ne baad main "ecotope" shabd ke prayog dwaara paaritantron ke sthanik had ko paribhaashit kiya
 The main idea of the ecosystem concept is that living organisms influence every other element in their local environment
 ujin odum, paristhitiki ke ek sansthaapak ne kaha:" ek ikai jisamen sabhi jeev shaamil hon jo bhautik vaataavaran ko prabhavit karen ki pranali ke bheetar urja kaa ek pravaah spasht rup se paribhaashit poshan sanrachana, biotic vibhinnata or saamagree chakra ek paristhitiki tantra he
 "the human ecosystem concept is then based on the interpretation of human / nature bifurcation and on the basis that all species are ecologically integrated with each other and with the biotic organisms of their biotopes

 The CBD defines "ecosystem" as: "a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microbe communities and their inanimate environment that function as a functional unit
" " Along with the need to conserve ecosystems, there was a political need to describe them and identify them efficiently
 Vryugdenhil and Sab say that using a physiognomic-ecological classification system can be achieved most effectively because Ecosystems are easily identifiable on satellite images along the region
 unhone kaha ki sambandhit vanaspati ke sanrachana or mausam-tatv, paristhitik data se purit prayek aaparivartak nirdharak hai jo aanshik rup se alag set prajatiyon ko alag karte hai
 This is true not only for plant species, but also for animal species, fungi and bacteria
 paritantr ke pahchaan kii maatra fisiognomik aaparivartak ke adheen he jise ek chhavi or / yaa kshetra main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Special fauna elements may be added where necessary, such as seasonal concentrations of animals and distribution of coral reefs
 kai fisiognomik-paristhitik vargeekaran pranaliyaan uplabdh hai: Several aquatic classification systems are available, an effort being made by the United States Geological Survey and the inter-american Biodiversity Information Network to design an entire ecosystem classification system that will cover both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
 vigyaan ke pariprekshya se, paaritantr asatat ikayan nahin hai jo keval ek "sahi" vargeekaran drushtikon kaa adhikaar par pahchaane ja sakaten hai
 An attempt by Tensley to describe or classify the ecosystem in agreement with this definition must be clear about the observer / analyst investment in classification, including normative reasoning
 "moulik jivan-aadhaar sevaayen jinpar maanav sabhyataa nirbhar karata he," or yah pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh ho unhen paristhitiki tantra sevaayen kehete hai

 The difference between collapse or a benign rebound is determined by two factors - the toxicity of the starting element and the resilience of the original ecosystem

 Therefore, stochastists view regional behavior at the ecosystem level as a regulatory mechanism rather than at the species level
 Thus, in their view, ecosystems are not regulated by the system itself and feedback mechanism and there is no such thing as a balance of nature

 In the absence of an equilibrium of nature, ecosystems have species composition, but the entire ecological collapse that will undergo change will depend on the nature of the changes that will probably be rare events

 Civil war is a war between organized groups within a single nation
 kabhi-kabhi grih yuddh aise bhi do deshon ke yuddh ko kaha jaataa he jo kabhi ek hi desh ke bhaag rahe hon
 The motives of gangs fighting in civil war are different
 kuch puure desh par niyantran paakar apni manachaahi vyavastha lagu karnaa chaahate hai, kuch desh kii sarkari nitiyaan badalanaa chaahate hai or kuch desh ko vibhajit karke apane kshetra ko swatantra bananaa chaahate hai
 Civil wars are often very deadly - millions may die, millions may be rendered homeless, decades of terrible poverty and hunger can spread in the country, and the country's industry may collapse for a long time

 During the civil wars, often foreign forces find the country weak and intervene in it, as in the Lebanon civil war that lasted from 1975–1990
 'grihayuddh' ko angreji main 'civil war', urdu main 'kaanaa-jangi', farsi main 'jang daakhili', arabi main 'herb ahalia', german main 'buargarkrig' kehete hai

 The area of this apabhramsa was originally Gujarat and western Rajasthan and in this view western Rajasthani or Marwari is closely associated with the Gujarati language
 gujarati sahitya main do yug maane jate hai- The works of Gujjar or Shvetanavar Apabhramsa can be considered as the ancient works of Gujarati
 ye praaia: jain kaviyon kii loksaahitiyik style main nibaddh rachanaayen hai
 We have a rich literature of Raas, Phag and Churchery poetry, among which the prominent are Bharatbahubaliras, Revantdas, Thulibhaddafag, Neminathchoupai etc

 There are many legends about his devotion to Krishna

 The time of the Bhalan poet is also considered to be approximately the same
 inhone ramayana, mahabharat or bhagwat ke puranic itivritton ko lekar anek kavy nibaddh kiye or garbasahitya ko janm diya
 In the depiction of Vatsalya and Shringar, Bhalan is considered a perfect hand
 pad sahitya or aakhyaan kaavyon kii in donon shaileyon ne madhyayugin gujarati sahitya ko kai kavi pradaan kiye hai
 Another important personality of the first genre is Mirabai, on whom the influence of Narsi is clearly reflected
 hindi or rajasthani kii tarah mirabai ke anek saras pad gujarati main paae jate hai jo narsi ke padon kii bhanti hi gujarati janata main lokgeeton kii tarah gaae jate hai
 The style of narrative poetry is found in many poets like Nagar, Keshavdas, Madhusudan Vyas, Ganapati, but it is reflected in the extremist premananda

 He was born in the Nagar Brahmin family of Baroda and was well versed in Sanskrit, Hindi, Gujarati etc
 languages

 It has been said above that the Bhalan poet had developed a special poetry style - Garba style
 yah style mulat: nrityparak lokgeeton se sambhddha he
 In this style, many devotional eulogies related to deities were written in the 18th century
 garabi kaviyon kaa alag sampradaay hi chal padaa, jisamen brahman, bhaat, patidaar sabhi tarah ke log milenge
 Prominent Garabi poets are Ballabh Bhatt, Pritam Das, Dhirobhakta, Neerant Bhakta and Bhoja Bhakta

 Among other poets, Muktananda, Manjukesananda and Devanand can be named
 vaise to juni gujarati main kuch gadhy kritiyaan milti hai, par madhyayugin gujarati main gadhyshailee kaa praudh vikaas nahin ho paaya tha

 main gujarati kaa sarvapratham vyakaran likhaa

 He does not know that he has heard it
 iske baad jab pragna ko hosh aata he vah is baat ko bataane ke liye abhi ke karyaalay main jaati he

 But in addition to this, recently, a few inscribed inscriptions written in Sinhala Brahmi on pottery dating to the sixth century BCE have been found at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka
 isa purv chauthi yaa paanchavi sadi ke tamil brahmi ke namoonay bhi bhattiprolu va anyatra mili hai
 The Gupta script came from northern Brahmi during the Gupta dynasty and was the mother of many handwriting in the medieval period, among them Siddham, Sharda and Nagari
 siddham lipi buddha dharm ke liye kaafii mahatvapurn thi kyonki kai sutara isi main likhe gaye the or aaj bhi japan main siddham sulekh kii kala kaayam he
 The script and other scripts were produced from Southern Brahmi and then many scripts were made in Southeast Asia
 teesri sadi main bhattiprolu buddha dharm kaa ek bada kendra tha, yaheen se buddha dharm purvi asia main failaa
 The modern Telugu script is derived from the Bhattiprolu script or 'kannada-telugu script', it is also called 'ancient Kannada script' because of its similarity to Kannada
 shuruyaat main kuch chote badlaav hue, usase jo lipi bani use ab tamil brahmi kehete hai, isamen kuch anya bhartiya lipiyon ke mukaable kahin kam akshar hai kyonki isamen alag se mahapraan yaa saghosh vyanjan nahin hai
 Later, the impact of the text led to the emergence of Vettuthu which resembles the modern Malayalam script

 The remains of the oldest known writings date back to the 3rd century BC, by which time many regional editions of the Brahmi script had already been made
 brahmi lipi kii banaavat paanchavi sadi isvin ke baad se or adhik vividh hoti gai or madhya yug main isane lagaataar kai nai lipiyon ko janm diya
 The main division of ancient times was between northern and southern Brahmi
