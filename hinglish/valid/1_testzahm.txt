 bhagwat puraana hinduon ke attharah puraanon main se ek he
 It is also called Shrimad Bhagavatam or simply Bhagavatam
 iskaa mukhya varnya vishay bhakthi yoga he, jisamen krishna ko sabhi devon kaa dev yaa swayan bhagwaan ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, devotion to Ras Bhava has also been represented in this Purana
 paramparaagat taur par is puraana kaa rachayita veda vyas ko mana jaataa he
 Shrimad Bhagwat is the crown jewel of Indian poetry
 bhagwaan shukdev dwaara maharaj parakshit ko sunaaya gaya bhaktimaarg to maano sopan hi he
 There is fragrance of Shri Krishna-love in each of its verses
 isamen saadhan-gyaan, siddhagyan, saadhan-bhakthi, siddha-bhakthi, maryaada-maarg, anugrah-maarg, dwait, advait samanvay ke saath preranadai vividh upakhyanon kaa adbhut sangrah he
 In the Ashtadash Puranas, Bhagwat is very important and famous Purana
 puraanon kii gananaa main bhagwat ashtum puraana ke rup main parigrihit kiya jaataa he 
 In the Bhagavata Purana, Maharishi Sut Goswami narrates a story to the sadhus presented to him
 sadhu log unase vishnu ke vibhinn avtaron ke bare main prashn poochhate hai
 Sut Goswami says that he had heard this story from another sage Shukdev
 isamen kul baarah sakandh hai
 All incarnations are described in summary form in the first episode
 aajkal 'bhagwat' akhya dhaaran karanevaale do puraana uplabdh hote hai : Therefore, in both these, whose calculation is required in the Purani category? a solution to this question is necessary
 vividh prakaar se samiksha karne par antat: yahi prathit hota he ki shrimadbhagwat ko hi puraana maananaa chahie tathaa devibhagwat ko uppurana kii koti main rakhana uchit he
 There is silence about the form of Shrimad Bhagwat Devi Bhagwat
 parantu devibhagwat 'bhagwat' kii gananaa uppuraanon ke antargat karata he tathaa apane aapako puraanon ke antargat
 The Bhuvanakosh mentioned in the Devi Bhagpanpancham wing literally follows the subject presented in the fifth wing of Srimad Bhagwat
 shribhagwat main bharatvarsh kii mahima ke pratipadak aathon shloke devi bhagwat main aksharsh: usee kram main uddhrut hai 
 The difference in the descriptions of the two is so much that where the Srimad Bhagavat takes a natural medium of prose for the sake of the description of the subject, Devi Bhagwat uses the artificial medium of the verse to demonstrate the uniqueness
 shrimadbhagwat bhakthiras tathaa aadhyatmagyaan kaa samanvay upasthit karata he
 The Bhagavata is considered to be the self-sufficiency of Nigamakalpataru, which has been made amritamay by the natural brahmachari and the great scientist Maharishi Shuk, combined with his melodious speech
 swayan bhagwat main kaha gaya he- 'vidyavatam Bhagwate Examination': Bhagwat is the test of scholarship and for this reason it is also incomparable in terms of commentary
 vibhinn vaishnav sampradaay ke vidwaanon ne apane vishisht mat kii upapatti tathaa paripushti ke nimitt bhagwat ke upar swasiddhantanuai vyakhyaaon kaa pranayan kiya he jinamein kuch tikaakaron kaa yahan sankshipt sanket kiya ja rahaa he: The exact decision of Bhagwat's country has not yet been made
 ekadash skandh main kaveri, tamraparni, kritamala aadi dravidadeshiy nadiyon ke jal pinevaale vyaktiyon ko bhagavan vasudev kaa amalashay bhakt batalaaya gaya he
 It is considered by scholars to be a clear indication of the Alavar of the Tamil country
 bhagwat main dakshin desh ke vaishnav tirthon, nadiyon tathaa parvaton ke vishisht sanket hone se katipay vidvan tamildesh ko iske udai kaa sthaan maanate hai
 There is a substantial difference in the subject of time also
 itnaa nishchit he ki bopadev, mahadev tathaa raja ramchandra ke karnadhipati tathaa mantri, prakhyat dharamshastri hemaadri ne apane 'chaturvarg chintamani' main bhagwat ke anek vachan udhrut kiye hai, bhagwat ke rachayita nahin maane ja sakate
 Shankaracharya's grandfather Guru Gaudapadacharya has quoted two verses of Bhagavat in his 'panchakaranavyakhya', 'jagruhe Paurusam Rupam' and 'shrey: Srutiin Bhakti Mudasya te Vibho' in 'uttaragita Tika'
 isse bhagwat kii rachana saptam shatee se arvachin nahin maani ja sakati
 The following table gives the composition of Bhagavata Purana suggested by some scholars- bhagwat kaa prabhaav madhyayugiya vaishnav sampradaayon ke udai main nitant kriyasheel tha tathaa bharat kii prantiy bhashaaon ke krishna kaavyon ke utthan main vishesh mahatvashaalee tha
 Ashtaghapi, Nimbarki, Radhavallabhi poets of Braj Bhasha took radiance and inspiration from Bhagwat, singing Radha Krishna's leelas in Brajbhasha
 mithila ke vidyapati, bengal ke chandidas, gyaandas tathaa govinddas, assam ke shankardev tathaa madhavdev, utkal ke upendra bhanj tathaa dinkrishnadas, maharashtra ke namdev tathaa madhav pandit, gujarat ke narsi mehta tathaa rajasthan kii mirabai - in sabhi santon tathaa kaviyon ne bhagwat ke rasmay varnan se prerana praapt kar radhakrishna kii kamaneey keli kaa gayan apane vibhinn kaavyon main kiya he
 The influence of Bhagwat on the Vaishnava poets of Tamil, Andhra, Kannada and Malayalam is also less
 bhagwat kaa aadhyatmik drushtikon advaitvaad kaa he tathaa sadhanadrushti bhakthi kii he
 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity
 inhen kaarnon se bhagwat valmikiy ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke saath sanskrit kii 'upjivy' kavyatrayee ke antarbhoot mana jaataa he
 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings
 iske vibhinn skandhon main vishnu ke leelavataron kaa varnan badi sukumaar bhashaa main kiya gaya he
 But the tenth Skandha is the heart of Bhagwat, giving a detailed account of the fine pastimes of Lord Krishna
 anya puraanon main, jaise vishnupurana, brahmavaivart aadi main bhi krishna kaa charit nibaddh he, parantu dasham skandh main lilapurushottam kaa charit jitani madhur bhashaa, komal padvinyas tathaa bhakthiras se aplut hokar varnit he vah adwitiya he
 Raspanchadhyayi spirituality and literature is a unique object in poetry from a different perspective
 venugit, gopigit,, yugalageet, bhramaragit ne bhagwat ko kavy ke udaatt str par pahunchaa diya he
 Following are the 12 skandas of Bhagwat - bhagwat puraana kaa ek prishth Childhood of lord krishna 1051 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1051 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian calendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh hai, jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 1051 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyug Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 The use of this art is seen worldwide with many cultural variations
 jo hastrekha padhate hai, unhen aam taur par hastrekhavid, hatheli padhane vaala, haath padhane vaala, hastrekha vishleshak yaa hastrekha shastri bhi kaha jaataa he
 Palmistry is generally considered pseudoscience
 neeche ullikhit jaankaree sankshep main aadhunik hastrekha shaastra ke mukhya tatv he, jinamein se kai vibhinn rekhaon kii vyakhya aksar virodhabhasi hoti hai or hastrekhavid vibhinn "skulon" main bante hote hai
 Palmistry has its roots in Chinese wising, astrology in India and Roma prophets
 mana jaataa he ki hindu rishi valmiki ne ek pustak likhi, jiske sheershak kaa angreji anuwaad "da teachings of valmiki maharishi on mail pamistry" hoga or jisamen 567 shloke hai
 From India, palmistry spread to China, Tibet, Egypt, Persia and other countries of Europe
 china se, hastrekha shaastra kaa yunaan main prasar hua, jahaan anexagores ne iskaa prayog kiya
 However, modern palmists have often associated traditional futuristic techniques with psychology, holistic diagnosis, alternative methods of estimation as well
 hastrekha shaastra main haath vyakti kii hatheli ko "padhakar" uske charitra yaa bhavishya ke jivan kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 Various "lines" and "peaks" or, are suggested by reading, presumably in relation to their associated sizes, properties and intersections
 kuch rivaajon main hastrekha padhane vaale ungaliyon, nakhunon, ungaliyon ke nishaan or vyakti kii twachaa kii rekhaon, twachaa kii bunaavat va rang, aakaar, hatheli ke aakaar or haath kaa lacheelaapan bhi dekhte hai
 a palmist is usually the 'dominant hand' of the person
 In some traditions of palmistry, the other hand is assumed to hold hereditary or family traits or is based on the palmist's cosmological beliefs, giving information about past life or pre-birth conditions
 "shastreey" hastrekha shaastra ke liye buniyadi dhaanche kii jad unani puranic kathaon main nihit hai
 Each area of the palm and fingers belongs to a goddess or deity and the features of that area are indicative of the nature of the corresponding aspect of the subject
 udhaaharan ke liye, anamika apollo unani devtaa ke saath judi he; anguthi vaali is ungali kii visheshtaayen kala, sangeet, saundaryashastra, shoharat, dhan or sadbhaav san sambhddha vishyon kii vivechna ke dauraan dekhin jaati hai
 Although there has been debate about which hand is better to read, both have their own importance
 yah maanane kaa rivaaj he ki baanyaa haath vyakti kii sambhaavnaaon ko pradarshit karata he or dahinaa sahi vyaktitv kaa pradarshak hota he
 Some say the importance is about which hand is seen
 "daahine haath se bhavishya or baayen se ateet dekha jaataa he
 "" The left hand tells what we are born with and the right shows what we have made of it
 " "dahinaa haath purushon kaa padhaa jaataa he, jabaki mahilaon kaa baayan haath padhaa jaataa he
 "" The left hand tells what God has given you and the right tells you what to do in this regard
 " But these are all things to say, only instinct and experience will tell you better which hand will be better to read in the end
 hastrekha shaastra or unhen padhane ke prakaar ke aadhaar par hastrekhavid hatheli kii akruti or ungaliyon kii linon, twachaa ke rang or bunaavat, nakhunon kii banaavat, hatheli or ungaliyon kii anupaatik aakaar, poron kii pramukhataa or haath kii kai anya khaasiyaton ko dekh sakate hai
 In most streams of palmistry, hand figures are divided into 4 or 10 major classical types and sometimes resort to classical elements or features
 haath kaa aakaar sanketit prakaar ke charitra ke lakshanon However, despite the different forms, the most common classifications are used by modern palmists
 swayan apni hatheli main prabhutv vaale tatv tathaa prakruti nirdhaarit karnaa sahaj he haath ke aakaar ke vishleshan main rekhaon kii sankhya or panktiyon kii gunvattta bhi shaamil kii ja sakati he
 In some traditions of palmistry, earth and water hands have fewer and deeper lines, while air and fire hands may show more lines that have less clear definition
 lagbhag sabhi haathon main teen rekhaaen pai jaati hai or aam taur par hastrekhavid in par sabase zyada jor dete hai
 This line originates from the edge of the palm above the thumb and rises in the shape of the arch in the direction of the wrist
 mana jaataa he ki yah rekha vyakti kii urja or shakti, shaareerik swasthya or aam khushhaali kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 It is also believed that lifelines reflect changes in life including accidents, bodily injuries, restorations
 aam dharna ke vipareet, aadhunik hastrekhavid aam taur par yah vishwaas nahin karte ki ek vyakti kii jivan rekha kii lambaai ke vyakti kii umr se judi hui he
 Additional main lines or forms include: hastrekhashastra ke anusaar, yah rekha ek vyakti ko uddeshy kii tivrata yaa kisi uddeshy ke prati ekaagratha pradaan karti he, jiskaa swabhaav haath par is rekha kii sahi sthiti or isse nikalanevaali kinhin shakhaon se nirdhaarit hoti he, jo ek saamaanya maamla hota he
 In those hands, in which such line is present as a single sign with no branch, it indicates a very deep nature and needs special care of individuals
 is rekha kii saamaanya sthiti sabase badi ungali ke neeche shuru hoti he or saamaanya rup se vahaan samaapt hoti he, jahaan dil kii rekha choti ungali ke neeche haath ke kinare khatm hoti he, isse vyakti ke ausat hiton kaa sanket miltaa he or swabhaav kii gahanta vishuddh rup se yahaan se nikalanevaali kinhin shakhaon kii disha se nirdhaarit hoti he
 The upper half of the palm, which is immediately below the fingers, represents the person's higher or intellectual nature and the lower half of the palm represents the materialistic side of the person's temperament
 agar in aadhe-aadhe hisson main se ek bada hota he, jo mukhya rekha kii kendriya sthiti yaa is maamle main ekal anuprastha hatheli rekha se nirdhaarit hota he, vyakti ke swabhaav ke vyapak vikaas ke pahalu ko pradarshit karata he
 While it is a general theory that if this line falls below its normal position it indicates a deeper intellectual temperament, but if it is above its normal position, it reflects a more materialistic nature and interests
 is rekha se nikali kinhin shakhaon kii disha kaa is rekha par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he, jisase upar paribhaashit parinaamon se upyukt sanshodhan hote hai or yah haath ke ubhaar kii prakruti par aadhaarit hota he
 For example, if a branch from this line moves towards the lower edge of the hand at the Moon's protrusion opposite the thumb, it indicates that the person is emotional and quite hesitant
 anya choti rekhaaen: Those who hold such truths to the test of logic often classify palmists as alleged psychologists, using a technique called "cold reading"
 cold reeding ko ek aisa abhyaas mana jaataa he jisamen hastrekhavidon sahit sabhi prakaar ke rekha adhyayankartaaon ko maansashasthri ke samaksh pesh hona padataa he
 According to a slightly more widely accepted finding, the accuracy of palmistry has been accepted as a system of character analysis, and no conclusive evidence has yet been found that there is a connection between palm lines and the person's character
 isse pare ki vishleshan se taarkik aadhaar par tay kiya jaye ki vyakti kaa ek gunasutra vikaar se peedit hona yaa ek nishchit anupaat main sankhyikeey samooh unke ankon ke aadhaar se sambhddha hote hai
 No conclusive data or facts have yet been found to support the claims made by the palmist in relation to life span or personality type

 This article is about the production of electricity using solar energy
 saura urja ke anya upyogon ke liye saura urja dekhen
 Solar power solar thermal light solar solar vehicle solar cell saura urja surya se praapt shakti ko kehete hai
 This energy is converted into heat or electricity and brought to other uses
 us rup ko hi saura urja kehete hai
 Solar energy is used in homes, cars and airplanes
 urja kaa yah rup saaf or pradooshan rahit hota he
 Solar panels are needed to get energy from the Sun and use it
 solar panelon main solar cell hote hai jo surya kii urja ko prayog karne laayak banaate hai
 There are many types of this
 jaise pani garm karne vaale solar panel bijli pahunchane vaale solar panelon se bhinn hote hai
 Solar energy is converted for use in two ways
 kuch varsh purv tak saura urja kaa prayog puraane dhang se bani imaaraton main kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Experts have done research on solar energy due to lack of fossil fuels in some developed countries
 anek udyogon main saura urja ko apnaane ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Solar energy continues to be used in many heterogeneous areas where the penetration of other energy sources is less
 saura bydaree yaa saura cell photovoltike prabhaav ke dwaara surya yaa prakaash ke kisi anya strot se urja praapt karata he
 Solar batteries are coupled to most devices in such a way that they become part of the device itself and cannot be separated from it
 surya kii roshni se ek yaa do ghante main yah puri tarah charge ho jaati he
 The cell in the solar battery incorporates the light to cause the electrons of the semiconductors to react with that metal
 ek baar yah kriya hone ke baad electron main upasthit urja yaa to bydaree main bhandar ho jaati he yaa phir sidhe prayog main aati he
 The solar battery discharges at its fixed time after energy is stored
 ye upkaran main lage hue swachaalit tareeke se punah chaalu hoti he, yaa use koi vyakti on karata he
 You can also buy a solar cell at home, today i will tell you about making a simple solar cell, this is just a modal, so that you will be able to get some better knowledge about the energy
 aap is modal se LED balb bgerah chalaa sakate hai
 Things you need ::
 You need copper wire, copper sheet, a plastic bottle, salt, hot water
 yah lekh kaise ghar par ek saura cell banane ke liye aapako bataa degaa, or yah karne ke baad aap ek ghadi, radio jese apane chote upkarnon ko chalaa sakate hai
 Method :: - 1 Take a copper sheet and cut it into equal parts
 kaatane ke baad aapke paas ek hi aakaar ke 2 tukade banegein
 Heat a sheet of 2 copper, about 20-30 MIN
 Till then let it cool down without breaking it
 3 iske saath tambe kii ek tar jod do
 Clean that place Jha to add tar
 Take another sheet and attach it to the tar as well
 5 ek plastic bottle lo or use bich se cat do ab isaki tali me namak or pani kaa ghol bana lo
 6 Now pour the heated copper sheet into this solution, but take care that only the sheet does not touch the wire
 7 ulti disha main duusari shit bhi daal do
 Your solar cell is ready
 
 
 
 TIPS :: - 1 Use salt to make solution
 2 cell ko achhi dhup main rakhen jese pani garm hone lagegaa aapkaa cell kam karne lagegaa
 3 Change the water after 2-3 days
 saura urja kii kai pareshaaniyaan bhi hoti hai
 Large-scale power generation requires heavy investment on panels
 doosraa, duniya main anek sthanon par surya kii roshni kam aati he, isliye vahaan solar panel kargar nahin hai
 Third, solar panels do not produce much electricity during the rainy season
 phir bhi visheshgyon kaa mat he ki bhavishya main saura urja kaa adhikadhik prayog hoga

 Burma Army and police attempted infiltration into Thailand from China and], Thakar Singh, Banta Singh, Shanghai and Santokh Singh and Bhagwan Singh from San Francisco, which mostly made up Sikhs of Ghadarite from branches in the United States, including leaders such as Is and is a Punjabi Muslim

 Meanwhile, with the help of the German consul Thailand Remy, Ghadarite set up a training headquarters in the jungles near the thai-burma border to reach Ghadarite from China and Canada

 However, the Thai Police high command, which was largely British, discovered these plans and Indian police infiltrated the plot through an Indian secret agent who was revealed the details by the Austrian charge d’affaires
 Thailand, although officially neutral, was allied closely with Britain and British India
 On July 21, the newly arrived British Minister Herbert Dering presented Foreign Minister Prince Devawongse with the request for arrest and extradition of Ghadarites identified by the Indian agent, ultimately resulting in the arrest of leading Ghadarites in August
 Only a single raid into Burma was launched by six Ghadarites, who were captured and later hanged
 Another plan that was explored to raid the penal colony in the Andaman Islands with a German volunteer force raised from East Indies and release the political prisoners to raise an expeditionary Indian force that would threaten the Indian coast
 The plan was proposed by Vincent Kraft a German planter in Batavia who had been wounded fighting in France
 It was approved by the foreign office on 14 May, 1915, after consultation with the Indian committee, and raid was planned for Christmas Day 1915 by a force of nearly one hundred Germans led by a former naval officer von Müller was raised
 Knipping made plans for shipping arms to the Andaman islands
 However, Vincent Kraft was a double agent, and leaked details of Knippings plans to British intelligence
 His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meanime revealed to Beckett by "oren", The Berlin Committee, through Ottoman Turkey, also established contact with Mahmud al Hasan of Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal
 This movement, led by the Deobandi Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Mahmud al Hasan, proposed a pan-islamic insurrection in the tribal belt of India with support from the Aghan Amir, the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany
 Ubaidullah proceeded to Kabul to establish contact with the Amir of Afghanistan while Mahmud al Hasan proceeded to Hijaz to establish contact with the Turkish Governor, Galib Pasha
 At Kabul, Ubaid Ullah decided that the pan-islamic cause would be best served by focussing on the Indian Freedom Movement
 Ubaidullah proposed that the Afghan Amir declare war against Britain
 Members of the Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal are known to have been active amongst Muslim troops along with Ghadarite agents in South Asia
 Attempts made by the Deobandis of Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal, to organize incursions from the western border of India from Persia, through Baluchistan, to Punjab
 Indian prisoners of war from France, Turkey, Germany, and Mesopotamia — especially Basra, Bushehr, and Kut al Amara — were recruited, raising the Indian Volunteer Corps that fought with Turkish forces in a number of fronts
 The Indians were led by Amba Prasad Sufi, who during the war were joined by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry
 These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans
 The Aga Khan's brother was killed while fighting the rebels
 The rebels successfully harassed British Forces in Sistan in Afghanistan, confining British forces to Karamshir in Baluchistan, and later moving towards Karachi
 Some reports indicating they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar
 The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites
 It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and Baghdad was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged
 They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz

 Meanwhile, the Germans sent a diplomatic mission to attempt to rally the Afghan Amir to the Central war effort
 The mission was headed by Oskar von Niedermayer and included Werner Otto von Hentig, the German diplomatic representative to Kabul, as well as Barkatullah and other prominent nationalists from the Berlin Committee
 Officially headed by Raja Mahendra Pratap, the mission also had representatives the Ottoman Empire, including Kasim Bey 
 The mission established contacts with the tribes of the indo-iranian border and encouraged them to strike against British interests
 This mission was met by Ubaidullah Sindhi's group at Kabul in December 1915
 Along with bringing members of the Indian movement right to India's border, it also brought messages from the Kaiser, Enver Pasha and the displaced Khedive of Egypt, Abbas Hilmi, expressing support for Pratap's mission and inviting the Amir to move against India
 The immediate aim was to rally the Amir against British India and to obtain from the Afghan government a right of free passage
 Although the Amir refused to commit for or against the German proposals at the time, it found support amongst the Amir's immediate and close political and religious advisory group, including his brother Nasrullah Khan, his sons Inayatullah Khan and Amanullah Khan, as well as religious leaders and tribesmen
 It also found support in one of Afghanistan's most influential newspapers, the Siraj al-akhbar, whose editor Mahmud Tarzi took Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916
 Tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap, as well as increasingly anti-british and pro-central articles and propaganda
 By May 1916, the tone in the paper was deemed serious enough for the Raj to intercept the copies to India
 By the end of 1916, hopes of the Amir's support were nearly non-existent
 Nonetheless, the Provisional Government of India was formed in Kabul December 1916 to emphasize to the Amir the seriousness of intent and purpose of the Germans and the Indians
 The government had Raja Mahendra Pratap as President, Barkatullah as Prime Minister, Ubaid al Sindhi as the Minister for India, Maulavi Bashir as War Minister, and Champakaran Pillai as Foreign Minister
 The provisional government found support from Enver Pasha, proclaiming Jihad against Britain
 It also attempted to obtain support from Tsarist Russia, Republican China, and Japan and after the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government corresponded with the nascent Soviet government
 In 1918, Mahendra Pratap met Trotsky in Petrograd before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin, urging both to mobilize against British India
 Under pressure from the British, Afghan cooperation was withdrawn and the mission closed down
 However, the mission, and its offers and liaisons at the time, had profound impact on the political and social situation in the country, starting a process of political change that ended with the assassination of Habibullah in 1919 and the transfer of power to Nasrullah and Later Amanullah, precipitating the Third anglo-afghan War that led to Afghan Independence
 By the end of 1917, divisions had begun appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other
 Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation
 The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation in the war in 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly
 Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded
 One of the last events linked to the conspiracy derives from the Irish involvement when, on 28 June 1920, units of the Connaught Rangers mutinied at Jullundur in Punjab
 The anglo-irish War had already begun in Ireland with German support, to which the British government responded with large scale troop deployments
 The most infamous of these were the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Division
 The news of atrocities by these units, upon reaching India, was instrumental in triggering a mutiny in the 1st Battalion of the Connaught Rangers
 Five men from c Company refused to take orders from their officers, declaring their intent not to serve the King until British forces left Ireland
 The Union Flag at Jullundur was replaced by the flag of the Irish Republic
 This mutiny was suppressed within three days and the mutineers imprisoned at Dagshai
 However, rumors of execution of the prisoners led to the spread of unrests
 atsolan, Private James Daly led about 70 Rangers in mutiny and tried to storm the armory, which the loyal guard successfully defended
 Two mutineers were shot dead while others were taken prisoner
 In all, about 400 men joined the mutiny, of whom eighty-eight were court martialled
 Fourteen were sentenced to death and the rest given up to 15 years in gaol
 a few were acquitted
 Thirteen of the men sentenced to die had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment
 21-year-old Daly was shot by a firing squad in Dagshai prison on November 2, 1920; he was the last member of British Forces to be executed for mutiny
 Daly and John Miranda were buried at the Dagshai graveyard

 Outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy began to be noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Incidents like the delhi-lahore Conspiracy and the Komagata Maru incident had already alerted the CID of the existence of a large-scale network and plans for pan-indian militant unrest
 Measures were taken which focussed on Bengal—the seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the time—and on Punjab, which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of Komagata Maru
 Har Dayal's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose, and were "cleaned up" in the wake of the Delhi bomb case
 At the outbreak of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little efforts to hide their plans and objectives
 These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy, as well as discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts
 Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries
 In Punjab, the CID, although aware of possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915
 a dedicated force was formed, headed by the Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan 
 In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of one Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan
 Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment
 Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence
 As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the D-day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day
 No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Khan of the change of plans
 Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to make good his escape under the cover of answering the call of nature
 The role of German or baltic-german double-agents, especially the agent named Oren, was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for Autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 as well as scuttling Bagha Jatin's plans in winter that year
 Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured
 Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war
 Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence
 By the time the war broke out the Indian Political Intelligence Office, headed by John Wallinger, had expanded into Europe
 In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office, approaching the European intelligence network of the Secret Service Bureau
 This network already had agents in Switzerland against possible German intrigues
 After the outbreak of the war Wallinger, under the cover of an officer of the British General Head Quarters, proceeded to France where he operated out of Paris, working with the French Political Police, the Sûreté
 Among Wallinger's recruits in the network was Somerset Maugham, who was recruited in 1915 and used his cover as author to visit Geneva while avoiding Swiss interference
 Among other enterprises, the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe
 a British agent called Donald Gullick was dispatched to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhaya while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet Mahendra Pratap to offer Kaiser Wilhelm ii's invitation
 It is said that Somerset Maugham based a number of his stories on his first-hand experiences, modelling the character of John Ashenden after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath
 The short story of Giulia Lazzari is a blend of Gullick's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and Mata Hari's story
 Winston Churchill reportedly advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories
 The Czech revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of Bagha Jatin's plans
 The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots
 The American network, headed by EV Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats
 Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities
 In the Middle East, British counter-intelligence was directed at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the Kabul Mission
 In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through both Irish as well as Indian channels
 The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by WC Hopkinson, who had grown up in India and spoke fluent Hindi
 Initially WCH had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of Taraknath das
the Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian seditionists on the East Coast as early as 1910
 Francis Cunliffe Owen, The officer heading the Home Office agency in New York, had become thoroughly acquainted with George Freeman alias Fitzgerald and Myron Phelps, the famous New York advocate, as members of the clan-na-gael
 Owens' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS Moraitis plan
 The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans, sensing infiltration, encouraged formation of an entirely Indian society
 Following this, a number of approaches were adopted, including infiltration through a "native" Indian intelligence officer by the name of Bela Singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to British intelligence, as well as the use of the famous American Pinkerton's detective agency
 WC Hopkinson himself was assassinated in a court in Victoria by a Ghadarite called Mewa Singh in October 1914
an Irish double agent by the name of Charles Lamb is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the Annie Larsen and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution
 An Indian operative, codenamed "C" The conspiracy led to a number of trials in India, most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy trial, which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny
 Other trials included the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge
 At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the Defence of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial
 Of these 42 were awarded the death sentence, 114 transported for life, and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment
 a number of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman
 Forty two defendants in the trial were acquitted
 The Lahore trial directly linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot
 Following the conclusion of the trial, diplomatic effort to destroy the Indian revolutionary movement in the United States and to bring its members to trial increased considerably
 In the United States, the Hindu German Conspiracy trial commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on November 12 1917 following the uncovering of the Annie Larsen affair
 One hundred and five people involved, including members of the Ghadar Party, the former German consul-general and vice-consul, and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco
 The trial itself lasted from November 20 1917 to April 24 1918
 The last day of the trial was notable for the sensational assassination of the chief accused, Ram Chandra, by a fellow defendant, Ram Singh, in a packed courtroom
 Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a US Marshal
 In May 1917, eight Indian Nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain
 In later years the proceedings were criticized as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that the United States was joining an Imperialist war
 The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations
 Strong public support in favor of the Indians, especially the revived Anglo-phobic sentiments following the colonial provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the Ghadarite movement to revive despite British concerns
 The conspiracy had a significant impact on Britain's policies, both within the empire and in international relations
 The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Alarmed at the agile organisation, which repeatedly reformed in different parts of the country despite being subdued in others, the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempts at pan-indian revolutions were spreading through India "like some hidden fire"
 a massive, concerted, and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement
 Attempts were made in 1914 to prevent the naturalisation of Tarak Nath Das as an American citizen, while successful pressure was applied to have Har Dayal interned
 The conspiracy, judged by the British Indian Government's own evaluation at the time, and those of a number of contemporary and modern historians, was an important event in the Indian independence movement and was one of the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century
 In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, it was a major factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act of 1915
 Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael o'dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement
 It was also a factor that guided British political concessions as well as Whitehall's India Policy during and after World War I, including the passage of montagu-chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917
 The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to Bolshevik Russia, as well as a still active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sydney Rowlatt, an English judge
 It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal
 On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India act of 1915, was enforced in India

 The events that followed the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy
 At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India
 The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention
 News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India
 The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India
 It was at this time that Gandhi, until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader
 Ominously, in 1919, the third anglo-afghan war began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul mission
 In addition, in India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests
 The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication systems
 The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that "practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000
" In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh
 This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days
 Michael o'dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer
 The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, contrary to being an isolated incident, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy
 James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre
 Lastly, British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderatist movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement
 The conspiracy influenced a number of aspects of Great Britain's international relations, most of all anglo-american relations during the war, as well as, to some extent, anglo-chinese relations
 After the war, it was one of the issues that influenced anglo-japanese relations
 At the start of the war, the American government's refusal to check the Indian seditionist movement was a major concern for the British government
 By 1916, a majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign Office were related to the Indian seditionist movement
 Before the outbreak of the war, the political commitments of the Wilson Government ,, and the political fallouts of the perception of persecution of oppressed people by Britain prevented the then ambassador cecil-spring Rice from pressing the issue diplomatically
 After Robert Lansing replaced Bryan as Secretary of State in 1916, Secretary of State for India Marquess of Crewe and Foreign Secretary Edward Gray forced spring-rice to raise the issue and the evidences obtained in Lahore Conspiracy trial were presented to the American Government in February
 The first investigations were opened in America at this time with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel, resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in the Hindu German conspiracy trial
 However, a perceptibly slow and reluctant American investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916, aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of the British far-eastern fleet on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels
 Seizure of German and Turkish passengers from the American vessel China by the 'HMS Laurentic at the mouth of the Yangtze River, followed by a number of incidents including the SS Henry S, which were defended by the British government on grounds that the seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in India, drew strong responses from the US government, prompting the US Atlantic Fleet to dispatch destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels
 Authorities in the Philippines were more cooperative, which assured Britain of knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong
 The strained relations were relaxed in May 1916 when the Britain released the China prisoners and released its aggressive policy seeking cooperation with the United States
 However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year

 However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year
 The conspiracy issue was ultimately addressed by William G
 E
 Wiseman, head of British intelligence in the United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police bypassing diplomatic channels
 This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty
 As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy
 Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality
 At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its Embassy to cooperate with the investigations resolving the anglo-american diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war
 Through 1915–16, China formed one of the major bases for the conspirators, and significant efforts were made by the British government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues
 This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the Entente powers
 However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war
 This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in southern China laid the foundations for deterioration of anglo-japanese relations as early as 1916
 After the end of the Great War, Japan rapidly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies
 Notable among these were Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, and AM Sahay
 The IIC was formally disbanded in November 1918, with most of its members becoming closely associated with Communism and the Soviet Union
 Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920
 Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of M
N
 Roy, was among the first Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements
 Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927
 He later fled Nazi Germany for Soviet Russia but disappeared in 1937 under Stalin's Great Purge
 The Ghadar Party, suppressed during the war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs
 Although sidelined in California, it remained relatively stronger in East Asia, where it allied itself with the Chinese Communist Party
 Although the conspiracy failed during World War i and the movement was suppressed at the time with a number of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, a number of prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand
 The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s, began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination
 During World War II, a number of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept
 Bose himself, from the very beginning of World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequently escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain
 He would later return to Southeast Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labour of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, and Rash Behari Bose
 The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi hukumat-e-azad Hind in Southeast Asia
 The Ghadar Memorial Hall in San Francisco honors members of the party who were hanged following the Lahore conspiracy trial, and the Ghadar Party Memorial Hall in Jalandhar, Punjab commemorates the Ghadarites who were involved in the conspiracy
 a number of those executed during the conspiracy are today honored in India
 Kartar Singh is honored with a memorial at his birthplace of the village of Sarabha
 The Ayurvedic Medicine College in Ludhiana is also named in his honors
 The Indian government has produced stamps honoring a number of those involved in the conspiracy, including Har Dayal, Bhai Paramanand, and Rash Behari Bose
 a number of other revolutionaries are also honored through India and the Indian American population
 a memorial plaque commemorating the Komagata Maru was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru at Budge Budge in Calcutta in 1954, while a second plaque was unveiled in 1984 at Gateway Pacific, Vancouver by the Canadian government
 The ship itself is today maintained by the Komagata Maru heritage foundation
 In Singapore, two memorial tablets at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall and four plaques in St Andrew's Cathedral commemorate the British soldiers and civilians killed during the Singapore mutiny
in Ireland, a memorial at the Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin commemorates the dead from the Jalandhar mutiny of the Connaught Rangers
 The conspiracy is known under a number of different names, including the Hindu Conspiracy, the indo-german Conspiracy, the Ghadar conspiracy, or the German plot
 The term hindu-german Conspiracy is closely associated with the uncovering of the Annie Larsen plot in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian Nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality
 The trial itself was called the hindu-german Conspiracy trial, and the Conspiracy was reported in the media as hindu-german Conspiracy
 However, the Conspiracy involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs as well, along with strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement
 The term Hindu was used commonly in opprobrium in America to identify Indians regardless of religion
 Likewise, conspiracy was also a negative term
 The term Hindu Conspiracy was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries
 The term Ghadar Conspiracy may also refer more specifically to the mutiny planned for February 1915 in India
 The term German plot may also refer more specifically to the plans for shipping arms to Jatin Mukherjee in Autumn 1915
 The term indo-german conspiracy is also commonly used to refer to later plans in Southeast Asia and to the mission to Kabul which remained the remnant of the conspiracy at the end of the war
 All of these were parts of the larger conspiracy
 Most scholars reviewing the American aspect use the name hindu-german Conspiracy, the hindu-conspiracy or the Ghadar Conspiracy, while most reviewing the conspiracy over its entire span from Southeast Asia through Europe to the United States more often use the term indo-german conspiracy
