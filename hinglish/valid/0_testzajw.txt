 The conversion of human beings from biological existence to social existence is also through socialization
 samajikaran ke madhyam se hi vah samskruti ko aatmsaat karata he
 The process of socialization introduces humans to the physical and non-physical forms of culture
 seekhney kii yah prakriya samaaj ke niyamon ke adheen chalati he
 In the language of sociology, we assimilate the social perception of our situation or status and the method of playing the role accordingly
 samajikaran vyakti ko saamaajik rup se kriyasheel banaata he
 It is through this that the discretion to conduct in accordance with the culture is developed
 iske liye vyakti dwaara saanskrithik mulyon kaa jo abhyantareekaran kiya jaataa he vah samajikaran kaa hi rup he
 But in the analysis and study of socialization, it should be kept in mind that social norms and culture are of paramount importance in the process of learning
 inhen asweekaar kar jo kuch siikhaa jaataa he, jaise hatya, chori yaa anya aapraadhik vaaradaaten karnaa, unhen samajikaran main nahin gina jaataa balki inaki ginati vipathagami vyavhaar main hoti he
 The person learning these is considered contrary to the mainstream of society
 vah samaaj main sakaaratmak yogadan dene kii avasthaa main bhi nahin rahata he
 These negative actions and behaviors are often seen as examples of failed socialization
 is prakaar samajikaran vyakti ko samaaj kaa prakaaryaatmak sadsy bana kar samaaj kii kriyaaon main bhaag lene main samarth banaata he
 One of the most important features of socialization is that it is a lifelong process
 vyakti kii paristhiti va saamaajik bhoomikaaye badalati rahati hai or unke anuroop vyavhaar ke liye use aacharan tathaa vyavhaar ke naye pratimaan seekhney padate hai
 For example, in childhood, where the child learns to behave with parents, relatives and the elderly through socialization, at a young age he has to learn new ways of dealing with his colleagues, superiors, neighbors, etc
 in the office 
 yahan tak ki vriddhavastha main bhi vyakti nayi bhoomikaagat apekshaaon ke anusaar sambandhit saamaajik vyavhaar grahan karata he
 Thus, socialization is a process that continues from birth to death
 samajikaran main siikhe gayi saamaajik or saanskrithik mulya desh-kaal saapeksh hote hai
 Therefore, the process of socialization is also country-time relative
 jaise ki kuch kabyli jatiyon main bacchon ko astr-shastr kaa prashikshan dene par or shahari samaajon main bacchon ko aupchaarik shiksha pradaan karne par bal diya jaataa he
 In a society like caste-based society like India, socialization has also been done according to caste occupations and ritualistic status
 jaise ki nimna jati ke bacchon ko krishi, dastakaari va shaareerik shram ke liye taiyaar kiye jane kaa chalan tha, jabaki brahman baalkon ko shiksha pradaan kii jaati thi
 Cultures in different parts of the world vary greatly, therefore socialization is relative
 yah kaal-saapeksh is prakaar he ki guzare jamaane main bhartiya samaaj main striyon ke liye pardaa karnaa, sharmaana or dhime swar main bolnaa adarsh vyavhaar tha
 Whereas in today's era of male-female equality, such social behavior is not expected much from women
 pehle bacchon ko charan-sparsh kii shiksha di jaati thi, jabaki aaj ve boy-boy karte hai
 That is, the change in values and pattern of development has also changed the method of socialization
 samajashastriyon ne samajikaran kii puri prakriya ko do hisson main vibhakt kiya he : praathmik samajikaran or dwitiyak samajikaran
 This division is based on the division of primary and secondary institutions of society
 praathmik samajikaran parivaar, pados evam naatedari, mitra-samooh va aarmabhik schuli shiksha ke madhyam se hota he jisamen baccha samaaj kaa sahabhaagi sadsy banane ke bare main bahut kuch sikhta he
 It is seen as a fundamental institution in socialization, considering the family as universal
 iske tahat sahyog, sahanubhuti, sahaayta tathaa aadan-pradaan ke gunon kaa vikaas hota he
 The love of brothers and sisters, love and control of elders have a special role in socialization of a person
 dwitiyak samajikaran kishoravastha se armbh hota he jisamen vyakti adhik aupchaarik vaataavaran kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar aacharan karnaa sikhta he
 In this stage, colleges, universities, political institutions, economic institutions like markets and shops, cultural institutions, business groups such as offices and factories, etc
 help them to become functional members of society
 samajikaran saamaajik niyantran kii samasya kaa bhi sahi samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 Difficulty in social control comes when people do not behave according to social norms
 samajikaran se samaaj ke sabhi sadsy ek si saamaajik sthiti main ek sa vyavhaar karte hai or samaaj main santulan, shanti tathaa saamanjasy barkaraar rahata he
 Suffixes such as de-socialization are also used under socialization
 iskaa arth yah he ki nakaaratmak samajikaran ke prabhaav main samaaj virdohi aacharan karnaa sikh chuke logon ko is prakaar kaa aacharan karne ke liye hatotsahit kiya jaae
 For example, if a person of criminal character is punished or understood and exempted from crimes, it will be a kind of de-socialization for him
 vi-samajikaran is rup main bhi dikhataa he ki vyakti pehle kii shikshaaon ko jaise buzurgon ke charan sparsh karne, havan-puja karne tathaa maansaahaar na karne jaise vyavhaar ko bade hone par bhul jaae
 This can be called de-socialization of learned behavior
 punrsamajikaran bhi isi se judi prakriya he jisamen vyakti kii jivan-style va vichaaron main parivartan ghatit hota he
 In the service of the army, training the person completely to the new style of life, attracting a criminal to positive thoughts, post-marriage woman's self-styling according to the different lifestyle of the house are examples of this re-socialization
 samajikaran ko vibhinn vichaarkon or samajashastriyon ne siddhanton ke aadhaar par samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he jinamein ji
ech
 mid, charles kule, emil durkhime pramukh hai
 Mead has primarily grounded the notion of a generalized other
 isamen dusron ke apane sambandh main vichaaron va apekshaaon ko koi baccha evam vayask aantarikikrut karata he
 In childhood, a child imagines the works of others and sees himself through them
 is prakaar vah saamaajik drushti se apni iyatta kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Charles Cooley explains his theory on the basis of introspection in the mirror
 kule ke mutabik bachche kii iyatta kaa nirdhaaran teen avasthaaon se hota he
 First, he wants to know what others think of me
 doosraa, vah dusron kii raay ke sandarbh main apane bare main paidaa soch ko samajhane kii cheshtaa karata he
 Third, he starts thinking of himself as good or bad, superior or inferior
 kule kii mukhya prasthaapana yah he ki vyakti ek lambi prakriya main apane bare main dharna banaata he or yah dharna dusron kii sahaayta se hi nirmit hoti he
 Durkheim has tried to explain socialization through social fact and collective representation
 unke mutabik samaaj kii paramparaayen, mulya, mandand, samuhik vishwaas aadi saamaajik tathy vyakti se upar hote hai
 a person gets his inheritance from birth
 inaki rachana vyakti kii akeli It is made by the group rather than by the hands of the unit
 ye vyakti se baahar hai or uske upar baadhyataa bhi aropit karte hai
 In this way, by assimilating these collective representations in the form of socialization, the person becomes an active and useful unit of the society, thereby also maintaining unity in the society

 Spencer developed an all-inclusive concept of origins as the gradual evolution of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies
 As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, humanities, economics, political theory, philosophy, biology, sociology and psychology
 apane jeevankaal ke dauraan unhone atyadhik prabhutv praapt kiya, visheshtah angrezi-bhashi shaikshanik samudaay ke bich

 vastav main, united kingdom va united stats main "ek samay tha, jab spencer ke shishy unki tulana arastu ke saath karne se bhi nahin chuke!" He is best known for presenting the concept of "survival of the best", which he presented in the Principles of Biology after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species

 Herbert Spencer, son of William George Spencer, was born on 27 April 1820 in Derby, England
 spencer ke pita ek dharmik bhinnmtavlambee the, jinka jhukaav methodism se quakerism tak badalata rahaa or aisa prathit hota he ki satta ke sabhi roopon kaa virodh apane putr main unhone hi sanchaarit kiya
 He ran a school established according to the developmental education methods of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and also served as secretary of the Derby Philosophical Society, a scientific institution founded in the 1790s by Erasmus Darwin, Charles's grandfather

 As both a teenager and a young man, Spencer found it difficult to stabilize in any intellectual or professional field
 During the boom in the field of rail transport during the 1830s, he worked as a civil engineer and also spent most of his time writing provincial magazines, which were non-religious in their religion and in their politics
 She was a democrat

 Its publisher, John Chapman, introduced him to his seminar, which included many of the capital's most democratic and progressive thinkers, including John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, George Henry Lewis and Mary Ann Evans, with whom he had a brief romantic engagement

 Spencer's next book, Principles of Psychology, published in 1855, discovered a physiological basis for psychology, his first reward from Evans and Lewis
 yah pustak in buniyadi manyataon par aadhaarit thi ki maanav man prakritik niyamon ke anusaar kaary karata he tathaa yah ki inhen saamaanya jeev-vigyaan ke dhaanche ke bheetar khoja ja saktaa tha
 This allowed an evolutionary approach to be adopted not only in terms of the individual, but also in terms of species and race
 Through this paradigm, Spencer's goal was Mill's logic's associative psychology, the notion that the human-mind was formed from molecular sensations held together by laws of associative thought, and that more 'scientific' seeming cranial science The theory, in which the core of specific mental functions was traced to different parts of the brain, was to reconcile
 spencer ne tark diya ki, ye donon siddhant satya kaa aanshik varnan karte the: vichaaron ke doharaavpurn saahchary mastishk ke utakon main vishisht reshon ke nirmaan main sammilit the, tathaa inhen prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke madhyam se ek se duusari peedi main bheja ja saktaa tha
 He humbly believed that psychology would do the same thing for the human mind as Isaac Newton did for matter
 haalanki, yah pustak prarambh main safal nahin thi or iske pratham sanskaran kii antim 251 pratiyaan june 1861 tak nahin bik sakin
 Spencer's interest in psychology was derived from a more basic concern establishing the universality of natural law
 apni peedi ke anya logon, chapman kii sangoshtee ke sadasyon sahit, kii hi tarah ve bhi is baat ko pradarshit karne ke vichaar se grasit the ki is brahmad main samast baton-maanav samskruti, bhashaa or nashvarata sahit-kii vyakhya saarvbhaumik vaidhata ke niyamon dwaara kii ja sakati thi
 This was in contrast to the views of many theologians at the time, who insisted that parts of the composition, particularly the human soul, were outside the domain of scientific research
 comte kii sistim di philosophy positive prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ko pradarshit karne ke lakshya se likhi gai thi or apane lakshya kii purti ke liye spencer ko comte kaa anusaran karnaa tha
 However, Spencer did not agree with Comte's belief that it was possible to find a rule of universal application, which he discovered in progressive development and called the theory of evolution
 san 1858 main, spencer ne ek ruparekha taiyaar kii, jo baad main kritrim darshanashasre kii pranali bani
 yah vishaal kaary, angrezi bhashaa main jiske samakaksh bahut thodi-si rachanaaen hi hai, kaa lakshya yah pradarshit karnaa tha ki utpatti kaa siddhant jeev-vigyaan, manovigyaan, samajashasre or nashvarata par lagu hota he
 Spencer thought that this composition of ten sections would take twenty years to complete; In the end it took him twice as long and it took almost the entire duration of his long life
 ek lekhak ke rup main swayan ko sthapit karne ke spencer ke praarambhik sangharsh ke baavjood, san 1870 ke dashak tak ve apane samay ke sarvaadhik prasiddh darshanik ban chuke the
 His works were widely read during his lifetime, and by 1869 he was able to make his living solely from books and his regular contributions to Victorian magazines, which were collected as three volumes of essays

 There was also a dining club founded by Huxley, whose members meet every month and included most of the leading thinkers of the Victorian period

 Also noted were some notable retainers, such as the liberal pastor Arthur Stanley, Dean of Westminster; And guests like Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were invited from time to time

 By the 1890s, his readers began to abandon him and many of his closest friends died and his mind was skeptical about the confident devotion to development that he had made his philosophical system central
 unke antim varshon main unke rajnatik vichaar roodhiwaadee hote gaye
 Although social statics was originally a creation of a democrat who believed in giving women the right to vote and in the nationalization of land to break the power of feudalism, by the 1880s, they were staunch women sufferers
 Had become adversaries and he collaborated with the Liberty and Property Defense League land owners in a common program against him Received, which they believe leaning toward "socialism" elements led by William Ewart Gladstone was largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself
 Spencer's political views of this period were expressed in The Man Versus the State, which has become his best work

 In 1902, shortly before his death, Spencer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature
 He continued his lifelong writing, often through dictation in the last years of his life, until he was overcome with illness at the age of 83
 unke mrit sharir ko landan ke higate kabristaan main karl marks kii kabr kii ore munh karke dafnaaya gaya he
 At Spencer's funeral, Indian nationalist leader Shyamji Krishnavarma announced a donation of £ 1,000 to establish the position of a lecturer at Oxford University as a tribute to Spencer and his works
 apni peedi ke anek logon ke man main spencer ke prati aakarshan kaa aadhaar yah tha ki ve vishwaas kii ek aisi purv-nirmit pranali prastut karte hue prathit hote the, jo ek aise samay par paaramparik dharmik vishwaason kaa sthaan le sakati thi, jab roodhiwaadee mat aadhunik vigyaan kii unnati ke saamne tuutakar bikhar rahe the
 Spencer's philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it was possible to believe in humanity's ultimate perfection based on advanced scientific concepts, such as the first law of thermodynamics and biological origins
 sankshep main, spencer kaa darshanik drushtikon devvaad or pratyakshvaad ke ek sangyojan se milakar bana tha
 On the one hand, he inherited some portions of eighteenth-century Devism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society, and from books such as George Combe's highly popular The Constitution of Man
 isamen vishwa ko sadbhaavpurn rachana vaala ek brahmad or prakruti ke niyamon ko ‘bhavathit rup se dayaalu’ mana gaya tha
 Natural laws were thus statues of the well-known universe, which were created by the Creator for the purpose of propagating human happiness
 haalanki spencer ne kishoravastha main hi apane isai mat kaa tyaag kar diya tha or baad main devatv kii kisi bhi ‘maanavarupi’ avadharana ko asweekaar kar diya, lekin iske baavjood ek lagbhag avchetan str par ve is avadharana ko dridhtaapurvak jakade hue the
 Although he owed much of the credit he gave to positivism, he had received much from it, especially in its creation of a philosophical system as the integration of various branches of scientific knowledge
 He was also following positivism in his insistence that it is possible to get only the real knowledge of facts and hence it was futile to speculate about the nature of the final truth
 pratyakshvaad or unke shesh devvaad ke bich yah tanaav kritrim darshanashasre kii puri pranali main bana rahaa
 Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; In this sense, his philosophy was focused on being 'artificial'
 comte kii hi tarah, ve bhi prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ke prati patibaddh the, jiske anusaar prakruti ke niyam bina kisi apwaad ke jaivik kshetra par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne kii ajaev kshetra par or maanav ke man par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne ki shesh sristi par
 is prakaar kritrim darshanashasre kaa pehla uddeshy yah pradarshit karnaa tha ki prakritik niyamon ke rup main, brahmad ke sabhi tathyon ke vaigyanik anveshan ko khoj paane main sakasham hone ke liye koi bhi apwaad nahin he
 All of Spencer's works on biology, psychology, and sociology were intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific areas
 yahaan tak ki naitikta par unke lekhan main bhi, unhone yah vichaar rakhaa ki nashvarata ke 'niyamon' ko khoj paanaa sambhav tha, jinamein niyamaatmak saamagree hone ke baavjood bhi jinaki avasthaa prakruti ke niyamon kii hi thi, yah ek aisi avadharana he, jiskaa mul combay ke constitution of main main dekha ja saktaa he
 The second purpose of Artificial Philosophy was to show that these same rules lead to development in a sustained way
 keval vaigyanik vidhi kii ekta par bal dene vaale comte ke vipareet, spencer ne sabhi prakritik niyamon ko ek buniyadi niyam, utpatti ke niyam, main vighatit karke vaigyanik gyaan ke ekikaran kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, he followed the paradigm proposed by Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous work Vestiges of Natural History of Creation
 haalanki aksar ise charles darwin kii da origin of spisis kaa ek prabhaavaheen agradoot kahkar khaarij kar diya jaataa he, lekin vastav main chembers kii pustak vigyaan ke ekikaran ke liye ek kaarykram thi, jiskaa lakshya yah darshana tha ki saura mandal kii utpatti ke liye laplas kii niharika pariklpana or lemark kaa prajati roopantaran kaa siddhant donon hi 'pragatisheel vikaas kaa ek adbhut samanyikaran' ke udhaaharan the
 Chambers was associated with Chapman's seminar and his work became an undisclosed mold for artificial philosophy
 spencer ke vikasvaadi drushtikon kii spasht abhivyakti pehali baar unke niabandh, 'progress: its lau and coz ' main hui, jo ki san 1857 main chapman ke westominster rivyuu main prakashit hua tha or jo baad main first principles of a new system of philasophy kaa aadhaar bana
 isamen unhone vikaas ke siddhant kii vyakhya kii, jisamen samual tailor colerij ke niabandh 'da thiyari of life '-jo ki swayan freedorich won shelling ke necharaphilosophy se vyutpann tha-se praapt jaankaree va bhruneey vikaas ke won bear ke niyam ke samanyikaran ko sanyojit kiya gaya tha
 Spencer expressed the view that all the structures of the universe evolve from a simple, uniform, symmetry into a complex, different, variety and the process of large integration of different parts continues with it
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki yah vikasvaadi prakriya puure brahmad main kaary karti hui dekhi ja sakati he
 It was a universal law, which was as much applicable to stars and galaxies, as much to biological beings and to the human social system as it was to the human mind
 It differed from scientific rules only by its general generality, and special science rules could be demonstrated as examples of this theory
 jatilta ke vikaas kii vyakhya karne kaa yah prayaas do varshon baad prakashit hui darwin kii origin of spisis main milane vaale prayaas se purnatah bhinn tha
 Quite often, incorrectly, it is believed that Spencer simply took over and normalized Darwin's work on natural selection
 However, even after reading Darwin's work, he introduced the phrase 'survival of the best' as his own vocabulary for Darwin's concept and is often mistakenly regarded as a theorist who used Darwinian theory Applied only to society, but still reluctantly included natural selection in their entire existing system prajati roopantaran kii unke dwaara pahachaani gai praathmik kaarividhi lemarkwaadi prayog-uttaradhikaar kii thi, jisane yah pratipaadit kiya ki ang prayog yaa apaprayog ke dwaara viksit athwa nasht hote hai or yah ki ye parinamit parivartan bhavi pidiyon main bhi sanchaarit ho sakate hai
 Spencer believed that this method of gradual development was also necessary to explain 'higher' gradual development, especially for the social development of humanity
 Furthermore, unlike Darwin, he believed that there was a direction and gradual point of gradual development, which is the final stage of the attainment of equivalence
 unhone jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ko samajashasre par lagu karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He propounded that society is the result of a change from lower to higher forms, just as it is said that according to the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life develop into proper forms
 spencer kaa daawa tha ki isi prakaar maanav kaa man bhi nimnatar pashuon kii saral swachaalit pratikriyaaon se lekar vichaarsheel manushya main tark-shakti kii prakriya tak kramik rup se viksit hua tha
 According to Spencer, there were two types of knowledge: knowledge acquired by the individual and knowledge acquired by the species
 Intuition, or unconsciously learned knowledge, was the hereditary experience of the species
 spencer ne bahut utsaah ke saath auguste comte ke mul pratyakshvaadi samajashasre kaa adhyayan kiya
 Comte, a philosopher of science, had proposed a theory of socio-cultural gradual development, according to which the development of society takes place through a general rule of three stages
 haalanki, jeev-vigyaan main vibhinn parivartanon ke baad likhte hue, spencer ne comte ke pratyakshvaad ke vichaaratmak pahaluon ko khaarij karte hue saamaajik vigyaan ko kramik vikaas ke jeev-vigyaan ke sandarbh main punarnirupit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Broadly, Spencer's sociology can be described as socially Darwinist
 spencer ne tark diya ki samaaj kaa vikaas saral, samaan, samarupata se jatil, bhinn, vividhta tak ke kramik vikaas kaa udhaaharan he
 He developed a theory of two types of society, terrorist and industrial, which was in line with gradual evolutionary progress

 Society, which Spencer considered a 'social animal', evolved gradually from a simpler state to a more complex one according to the universal law of evolution
 iske alaava, audyogic samaaj soshal statics main viksit adarsh samaaj kaa pratyaksh vanshaj tha, haalanki spencer ne ab is baat ko spasht rup se vyakt nahin kiya ki kya samaaj kaa parinaam araajaktaavaad ke rup main milegaa yaa kya yah rajya kii ek nirantar bhoomika ko suchit karata he, haalanki ek aisi bhoomika, jo ki sanvidaaon ke pravartan or bahya suraksha ke nunatam kaaryon tak simit ho chuki hogi
 Although Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not less than his influence on structural pragmatism, his attempt to present Lamarckist or Darwinian ideas in the field of social science failed
 Even some people considered it to be actively dangerous
 Interpreters of the time, such as Wilhelm Dilthey, became the promoters of the distinction between natural sciences and human sciences
 In the 1890s, Emil Darkhim established formal academic sociology, with a strong emphasis on applied social research
 beesvin sadi ke mode par, german samajashasreiyon kii pehali peedi, sarvaadhik ullekhneey rup se maiks webar, ne vidhiparak apratyakshvaad ko prastut kiya tha
 As predicted in Spencer's first book, the creation of the 'ideal man in an ideal society' would be the last point of the process of gradual development, in which humans would have fully embraced social life
 The main difference between Spencer's early and later concepts in terms of this process was the time-scale of the gradual development involved
 manovaigyanik-or atah naitik bhi-sanrachana, jo ki hamaare purvajon dwaara vartmaan peedi ko viraasat main di gai he, tathaa jo aage ham apni bhavi pidiyon ko denge, samaaj main nivas kii aavashyaktaaon ko kramik rup se apanaae jane kii prakriya main thi
 For example, aggression was an intuition associated with survival, which necessitated the primary conditions of life, but it became unnecessary to adopt it in advanced societies
 Since human intuition had a special place in the fibers of brain tissue, it was subject to the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession, so that gradual changes could be transferred to future generations
 With the passage of several generations, the process of gradual development will ensure that humans become less aggressive and incrementally altruistic, eventually resulting in the creation of an entire society in which no one will hurt another person
 haalanki kramik vikaas ke dwaara ek purna vyakti kaa nirmaan karne ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki vartmaan or bhavi peediyaan apane vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' parinaamon kaa anubhav karen
 keval isi tareeke se vyaktiyon ko aatm-sudhaar kaa kaary karne or is prakaar apane uttaradhikariyon ko ek unnat naitik gathan pradaan karne ke liye aavashyak prerana praapt hogi
 atah vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' sambandh or iske parinaam ke bich vyavdhaan utpann karne vaali kisi bhi baat ko roka janaa chaiye or isamen garibi mitaane, saarvajanik shiksha pradaan karne, yaa anivaary tikaakaran ko aavashyak banane kii rajya kii pratirodhi shakti kaa prayog bhi shaamil tha
 Although charitable donations were to be encouraged, they were also to be limited by the idea that human beings often receive sorrows as a result of their actions
 atah vyaktiyon kaa 'ayogy garibon' kii ore nirdeshit atyadhik paropkaarita vyavhaar or parinaam ke bich us kadi ko tod degi, jise spencer is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye buniyadi aavashyaktaa maanate the ki vikaas ke ucchtar str par maanavtaa kaa kramik vikaas jari rahe
 Spencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value — the greatest happiness of the greatest number — and according to him the climax of the process of evolution would be the greatest assessment of utility
 People living in an ideal society will not only get pleasure from the practice of synonyms, but they will also try to avoid causing misery to others
 They will also instinctively respect the rights of others, as a result of which the principle of justice will be adhered to globally - each person will have the maximum amount of freedom, consistent with the same amount of freedom that others receive
 'freedom' refers to the absence of coercion and is intimately tied to the right to private property
 spencer ne aacharan ke is niyam ko 'param nitishasre' kaha, jisane niti-shasr kii ek vaigyanik aadhaar vaali pranali pradaan kii, jo ateet kii aloukikta-aadhaarit niti-shasr pranaaliyon kaa sthaan le sakegi
 haalanki, unhone is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki hamaare dwaara viraasat main praapt kiya gaya naitik gathan abhi hamen param nitishasre ke niyamon ke saath purna anurupata se vyavhaar karne kii anumati nahin detaa or yahi kaaran he ki hamen 'saapeksh nitishasre' ke ek niyam kii aavashyaktaa he, jisamen hamaari vartmaan apurnataa ke vikrutisheel karkon par bhi vichaar kiya gaya ho
 Spencer's distinctive approach to musicology was also linked to his ethics
 spencer ne sochaa ki sangeet kaa udgam joshpurna vaktrutv kala main dhundha ja saktaa he
 The speaker exerts affirmative effect, not only by the rationality of his words, but also by his accent and accentuation — as Spencer expressed it, the musical qualities of his vowel act as "commentary of emotion on sentences of intelligence
" We do
 sangeet, jise vaktruta kii unki visheshta kaa ek unnat vikaas mana gaya, prajatiyon kii niti-shasr kii shiksha or vikaas main yogadan detaa he
 "the bizarre ability of us to be influenced by melodies and rhythms, perhaps, lies in both the fact that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realize those immense pleasures, and that in some way or the other they are Are related

 " spencer ke antim varshon main unka praarambhik ashavad ko nasht hota hua dikhaai diya or iskaa sthaan maanav ke bhavishya ke prati ek nirashavad ne le liya
 Despite this, he devoted most of his efforts to support his arguments and prevent misinterpretation of his important theory of non-interference
 victorian logon ke bich spencer kii pratishtha kaa bahut bada shrey unke agyeyavaad ko he
 He rejected theology as a representative of 'atheism of those who pretend piety'
 His rejection of the traditional religion earned him immense maladjustment and was often condemned by religious thinkers accusing him of being an advocate of atheism and materialism
 Nevertheless, unlike Huxley, whose agnosticism was a concentrated terrorist sect toward 'an unforgivable sin of faith', Spencer emphasized that they did not seek to devalue religion in the name of science, but rather the harmony between the two Were worried about setting up
 spencer kaa tark tha ki ham chaahe dharmik vishwaas se prarambh karen yaa vigyaan se, antat hamen kuch anivaary, lekin shabdic rup se kalpanaateet dharanaon ko sweekaar karnaa hi padataa he
 Whether we are concerned about a manufacturer or the ground level, which lies beneath our experience of facts, we cannot draw a blueprint for its concept
 Spencer concluded that, therefore, religion and science accept the ultimate truth that human understanding is only capable of understanding 'relative' knowledge
 aisa isaliye he kyonki, maanav ke man kii antarnihit simaaon ke kaaran, keval tathyon kaa gyaan praapt kar paanaa hi sambhav he, tathyon ke neeche sthit vaastaviktaa kaa nahin
 atah vigyaan or dharm donon ko yah baat sweekaar kar leni chaiye ki 'samast tathyon main yah sarvaadhik nishchit he ki brahmad main hamen jo shakti dikhaai detii he, va purnatah agamya he
 He called it the realization of the 'agnostic' and he presented the worship of the agnostic as a positive belief capable of replacing traditional religion
 vastav main, unka vichaar tha ki dharm ke kramik vikaas main agyeya antim charan, iske antim maanavarupi avasheshon ke antim nishkasana, kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The Spencerian ideas prevalent in the twenty-first century derive from their political theories of the late nineteenth century and their memorable attacks on reformist movements
 ichaswatantryavaadiyon tathaa rajyaviheen-poonjeevaad dwaara unhen agua tehraaya gaya he
 Economist Murray Rothbard called social statistics "the greatest greatest creation of libertarian philosophies of all time"

 "as a result of this perspective, Spencer was a staunch critic of patriotism
 jab unhen bataaya gaya ki dwitiya afgaan yuddh ke dauraan british senaayen sankat kii sthiti main hai, to pratikriyaswaroop unhone kaha: "jab log dusron ke aadesh par anya logon ko, unke andolan ke auchity ke bare main kuch bhi puche bina, goli maarane ke liye swayan ko kiraaye par de dete hai or yadi swayan unhen hi goli maar di jaae, to main is baat kii chintaa nahin karata
" In the last part of Victorian Britain, politics moved in the direction that Spencer disliked and his arguments provided so much ammunition for liberals and individualists in Europe and America, that they are used even in the twenty-first century
 abhivyakti 'dir iz no alternetive ’, jise pradhanmantri margarette thechar ne prasiddhi dilaai, kaa mul spencer dwaara iske zordaar prayog main dhundha ja saktaa he
 By the 1880s, he had come to condemn "neo-conservatism"
 In The Man Versus the State, he criticized Gladstone and the Liberal Party for deviating from their true mission and instead promoting paternalistic social law
 Spencer emphasized Irish land-reform, compulsory education, laws governing workplace safety, prohibition and foreclosure laws, tax-funded pus
 Condemned libraries and welfare reforms
 He objected primarily to three things: the exercise of the government's coercive powers, the discouragement of voluntary self-improvement, and the disregard of "rules of life"
 He said the reforms were "socialism
" , They considered it equivalent to "slavery" in the context of limiting human freedom

 Spencer, in particular his "rules of equal freedom", his insistence on the limits of prophetic knowledge, his model of a naturalized social order, and his warnings about the "unintended consequences" of groupist social reforms, such as Freedrich Hayek Many analytical approaches of liberal theorists were anticipated

 Spencer also had a profound influence among thinker leaders, although it was often expressed in his reaction to and disapproval of Spencer's ideas

 Soon after his death his reputation as a philosopher sharply declined
 Half a century after his death, his work was dismissed as "imitation of philosophicalism", and historian Richard Hofstader called him "an elementalist and cracker of self-made intelligence" -barrel agnostic dubbed Prophet
 " Nevertheless, Spencer's ideas were so deeply ingrained in the Victorian period that his influence did not completely dissipate

 Spencer also influenced the Japanese Westernist Tukotumi Soho, who believed that Japan was on the verge of transition from a "terrorist society" to an "industrial society" and that it was necessary to throw away all Japanese talk and western policy soon
 And adopt education
 He also contacted Kaneko Kentaro and warned him of the dangers of imperialism

 Being highly focused on the appropriate place and order of the parts of an English sentence, he created a guide for effective writing
 Spencer's aim was to make prose writing as free of "friction and passivity" as possible, so that the reader's pace does not slow down due to the appropriate context and painstaking deliberation of the meaning of a sentence
 Spencer argued that the author's ideal "is to present ideas in such a way that the reader can understand them through the least possible mental effort"

 Acids, solids, liquids or gases can be found in any physical state
 ve shuddh rup main yaa ghol ke rup main rah sakate hai
 The substance or compound in which the properties of acids are found are called
 maanav antra main hydrochloric amla kii adhikta se hone vaali beemaari ko amlata yaa acidity kehete hai
 Acids are substances that are sour in taste when dissolved in water, turn a roly made from turmeric to yellow, and their aqueous solution turns blue litmus paper red
 adhikansh dhaatuon par abhikriya karke hydrogen gas utpann karte hai, or ksharak ko udasin kar dete hai
 Fatty bases are those substances whose solution looks smooth, tastes bitter, turns turmeric red and neutralizes acids
 udasin karne kaa arth he aise padaarth kaa bananaa jisamen na amla ke gun hote hai, na ksharak ke
 While studying the properties of oxygen, Lavazi observed that when the elements like carbon, sulfur and phosphorus are burned in oxygen, the oxides made from them form acids with water
 ve is parinaam par pahunche ki amlon main oxygen rahata he or amlon kii amleeyta kaa kaaran oxygen he
 For this reason, this gas was named "oxygen", which means "acidifier" and for this reason, in the German language, Oxygen is called "sire stuff"
 lavaazie ne hi amlon ko do virgon, acarbonic amalon or carbonic amlon main vibhakt kiya tha
 It was seen that oxides of some elements dissolve in water to form not alkalis but alkalis and some acids do not contain oxygen at all
 bertile ne san 1787 main hydrosienic amla, davy ne san 1810-11 main hydrochloric amla or san 1813 main hydrodic amla kaa avishkaar kiya
 There is no oxygen in any of them
 aage chalakar dekha gaya he ki jo padaarth bilkul sookhe hote hai, unamem koi amleey abhikriya nahin hoti
 Then people divided the acids into two classes, one hydro-acid and the other oxy-acid
 peeche san 1815 main davy ne suzav rakhaa ki amlon kii amleeyta oxygen ke kaaran nahin, varan hydrogen ke kaaran he
 Dulang studied oxalic acid in 1815 and came to the conclusion that there is no difference between oxygenated and non-oxygenated acids
 amlon main koi aisa gun nahin he jise ham amlon kaa vishisht lakshan kah saken
 Common properties have been stated above
 amla or dhaatu kii abhikriya main amla ke anu kaa ek, yaa ek se adhik, hydrogen parmaanu dhaatuon, dhaatuon ke oxidon, hydroxidon athwa carboneton se visthapit ho jaataa he
 There are also some acids that are sweet instead of sour
 aisa ek amla amido-fosphrik amla he
 There are some acids which are not alkaline
 kuch aise bhi kshar hai jinka hydrogen dhaatuon se visthapit ho jaataa he
 Alum is not acid
 isamen visthapit honevaala koi hydrogen bhi nahin he
 But it is sour in taste and alkali in action
 yah nile litmus ko laal bhi kar detaa he
 Similarly sodium bisulfide is sour and alkali
 yah nile litmus ko laal karata he
 It also has displacing hydrogen, but it is not acid
 mithen amla nahin he, par iskaa hydrogen jaste se visthapit ho jaataa he or is prakaar zinc diemethil banataa he jo lavan nahin he
 Therefore, no satisfactory definition of acid has yet been given
 aayan siddhant ke aadhaar par yadi ham amlon kii paribhaasha dena chahen to kah sakate hai ki amlon main hydrogen yanon kaa rahanaa atyaavashyak he
 In 1659, Silvian first differentiated into acids and bases
 rule ne san 1774 main ksharak naam us padaarth ko diya jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaata he
 Nowadays, bases are those oxygen-rich substances that are supplemented by acids
 kshar dhaatuon, kshariyamruda dhaatuon or anya dhaatuon ke oxide or ve sabhi vastuen ksharak hai jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaati hai
 Initially the base was applied only to metals or oxides of metals that were "bases" or bases of salts
 lavenon ke ksharak aavashyak avyav hai
 Bases are actually substances that combine with acids to form salts and water
 udhaahrant:, zinc oxide salphurik amla ke saath milakar zinc sulphate or jal banaata he
 Dahk soda combines with sulfuric acid to form sodium sulfate and water
 dhaatuon ke oxide saamanyat: ksharak hai
 But there are exceptions to this
 ksharakon main dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide hai, par suvidha ke liye tatwon ke kuch aise samooh bhi rakhe gaye hai jo amlon ke saath milakar bina jal bane hi lavan banaate hai
 Among such bases are ammonia, hydroxylamine and phosphine
 drav ammonia ghul jaataa he par phinolfaileen se koi rang nahin detaa
 Thus, to what extent can it be called base, this thing is doubtful

 is sataha par daraaren to nazar aati hai lekin prahaar cretar bahut kam hai
 The cracks also appear to be filled with new snow
 sataha ko dekh kar bahut se vaigyanikon ko lagata he ke uske neeche zarur ek pani kaa samudr hoga
 Their thinking is that whenever the surface bursts due to a meteorite falling or it cracks due to the pull of Jupiter's tidal force, the hot ice that contacts the ocean water from below comes up and tightly heals the wound
 is
 agar vastav main aisa samudr he to sambhav he ke usamen jivan punap rahaa ho
 Due to this possibility, the Space Exploration Agencies of Europe and America are planning to do more research on Europa
 vaigyanik yah bhi anumaan lagate hai ke europa kii sakht barfili sataha arabon saal pehle hue apane nirmaan ke baad 80° gum chuki he
 This gives rise to the suspicion that the superficial ice shell is floating above a water sphere and can move freely
 anya vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ke aisa koi samudr nahin he or baahar kii sakht barf ke neeche keval naram barf he - lekin aisa vishwaas rakhane vaale vaigyanik alp sankhya main hai

 Because scientists believe that the surface of the upper ice is more than 10 km thick, this vehicle will have to be sunk very deep to reach the sea
 yah bhi aavashyak hoga ke isaki prasaaran shakti bahut ho taaki barf kii itani gaharaai ke neeche se bhi vah sandesh or tasviren bhej sake
 This vehicle will also have such ability that it can roam in the ocean itself and can choose its direction because it will take few minutes to reach the directions from the earth

 pusdamutevi main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he
 National interest refers to the economic, military, cultural goals and ambitions of a country
 rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he, kyonki rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon ko banane main inaki vishesh bhoomika hoti he
 The foreign policy of any nation is basically based on national interests, so the evaluation of its successes and failures also changes the national interest, as a result of which foreign policy also undergoes a change
 rashtriya hiton sambandhit anya jaankaree se purv inhen paribhaashit karnaa anivaary he jo is prakaar se he- Various scholars have divided national interests into several categories
 udhaaharan swaroop, vidwaan inhen pratham koti ke hit, gaun hit, sthai hit, asthai hit, saamaanya hit, vishisht hit aadi main vargeekrut karte hai
 But basically placing them in two major categories provides a more clear picture - jahaan tak pramukh hiton kii baat he prayek raashtra teen pramukh hiton ke aadhaar par apni videsh niti ke uddeshy tay karte hai
 These are the three main interests prayek raashtra ke pramukh uddeshyon main in teenon karkon kaa hona isliye aavashyak he ki pratham par rajya kaa mul aadhaar / astitv tikaa hua he
 Its smooth development on the second and the importance of the third is because the fulfillment of these interests is possible only in a specific world environment, not in solitude
 atah koi bhi raashtra in teen pramukh hiton ke sandarbh main hi apni videsh niti yaa rajyon ke saath parsparik sambandh sthapit karata he
 Minor interests are not as important as major interests but are necessary to keep any nation in power
 in hiton ke liye raashtra apana sarvasy yaa yudhon tak jane ke liye taiyaar nahin hota, parantu phir bhi inaki purti hetu prayaas karata he
 Through these interests, the nation fulfills the aspirations established by its social, cultural, heritage etc
 iske atirikt, apane videshon main sthapit kaaryon ko purna karne kii koshish karata he
 Through them, it also tries to fulfill the interests of its citizens settled abroad
 atah in hiton kii purti hetu bhi raashtra kaaphi prayaas karte hai
 But as stated above, overall national interest is dynamic, not permanent
 isiilie jitne zyada se zyada ho saken utane sambhavit hiton kii purti hetu raashtra prayasarat rahete hai
 Whatever is said in the context of national interests, ultimately the truth is that all nations do their utmost to promote them
 is sandarbh main raashtra vibhinn sadhano kaa upyog karte hai jinamein se pramukh nimnlikhit hai- The implementation of the foreign policy of any nation is through diplomacy
 rajnay apane aap main naitik aniatik nahin hota balki apane raashtra hiton ke anuroop hota he
 Nor is it an objective situation, rather it is a subjective system that each nation assesses within its own perspective
 rajnay apane desh ke videshon main sthapit duutavaason va vaanijya kendron ke atirikt videsh mantralay, rajnatik netritv va kai anya vyaktiyon va sansthaaon kii bhagidaari ke anuroop karyanvit hota he
 Diplomacy is both bilateral and multilateral
 rajnay ke swaroop bhi sthitiyon ke anuroop naye-naye sandarbhon main prastut hote hai
 Publicity is also an important way of increasing and fulfilling national interests
 prachaar duusare rashtron ke tarkon ko galat siddh karne tathaa apni baat ko failaane kaa hameshaa tarika rahaa he, lekin 20veen shatabdi main hi prachaar ko ek mukhya saadhan ke rup main upyog kiya gaya he
 This was most clearly seen in the period between the two world wars when the nations through various ideologies - Communism, Nazism, Fascism - used them to establish and promote their power
 shityudh kaal main bhi donon mahashaktiyon ne apane-apane varchasv ko banane hetu rashtron ke madhya samyavaadee va poonjivadi vikaas ke pratimaanon ko apnaane hetu pratispardhaa paidaa kii
 Even in the post-cold War era, globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 are being promoted by a single power only as an option left with the nations and to justify their foreign policy intervention policies
 is prakaar do pramukh kaarnon se pichhali shatabdi main prachaar kaa kaaphi prayog hua he
 The first reason has been the revolution in communication tools which made the propaganda very quick, reliable and easily available
 doosraa shaayad ati aadhuniktam hathiyaaron kii utpatti se bal prayog ke vikalp kii samaapti ne bhi is saadhan ko adhik mahatvapurn bana diya he
 Whatever the reasons may be, but the methods of the present-day communication revolution have presented propaganda as an effective mechanism of foreign policy
 rajnatik yuddh bhi rashtrahiton kii abhivruddhi kaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan rahaa he
 This is neither war but peace
 iske dwaara rajnay ke madhyam se rajyon ke madhya dandatmak sthiti bananaa yaa aarthik pratibandh lagaana jisase virodhiyon par dabaav kii sthiti bani rahati he
 In the current international politics, the state of political war is created by various methods - vartmaan yug antahnirbharta kaa yug he
 Every nation, no matter how powerful or small, has to depend on each other
 koi bhi sampoorn rup se aatm nirbhar nahin he
 But for each nation to fulfill its national interest, those nations increase their national interests on the basis of their resources
 inhen sansadhano ke prayog se badi shaktiyaan videshon main sainya adde sthapit karne, vikasshil deshon main satta parivartan, sasta kaccha maal praapt karne, kamjor rashtron kii nitiyon ko prabhavit karne, rajyon kii mudra ke avamulyan karne, vyapaar kii sharten tay karne aadi main safalataa praapt kar leti hai
 In this context, economically powerful nations use two types of means towards other countries - main economic system and secondary economic system
 mukhya aarthik tantra kaa prayog nimna tareekon se kiya jaataa he - Under the means used on the basis of secondary economic system - princely state, boycott, blockade
 inhen aarthik sadhano ke dwaara raashtra apane rashtriya hiton main abhivruddhi karte hai
 Before 1945, the great powers had increased their national interests by resorting to imperialism
 saamaanya taur par jab koi raashtra duusare rajya kii seemaa va janata par jabardastee kabja kar len to use samrajyavad kehete hai
 Different scholars have given different theories to explain this
 samrajyavad ke swaroop ko kai roopon main dekha ja saktaa he
 It is sometimes motivated by big states due to economic reasons, maintaining status quo, national prestige etc
 for many reasons
 samrajyavad kii nitiyon ke dwaara rashtron ko aarthik laabh, shakti nirmaan tathaa aviksit deshon ke kalyaan aadi praapt hote hai
 This serves the national interest of the powers
 parantu yadi vastav main dekha jaae to kuch chand rashtron ke hiton ke purti hetu samrajyavad se zyaadaatar rashtron kaa shoshan, anyaay, pichhadaapan, garibi, bhukhmaree aadi badhati he
 Therefore, in the years after 1945, regional imperialism has almost ceased
 upniveshwaad ke madhyam se 18veen va 19veen shatabdi main europe kii badi takaton ne teesri duniya ke zyaadaatar deshon par rajya kiya he
 Under this, foreign states have been ruled by external powers, who control all the subjects of the local people
 puri rajnatik vyavastha unke haath main hoti thi
 The government was run by foreign forces only
 bhu-bhaag par bhi purna niyantran bahya shaktiyon kaa hi hota tha
 The freedoms of the local people also ran at their behest
 parantu swatantrata aandolan ke lambe sangharsh ne 1950 va 1960 ke dashakon main sabhi ko aaazaad kara diya tathaa upniveshi vyavastha kaa praayah ant ho gaya
 After 1945, the place of colonialism was taken over by 'neo-colonialism'
 ab kshetreey va rajnatik rup se to rajya swatantra ho gaye, lekin aarthik rup se abhi bhi gulam bane rahe
 In terms of economic resources, 30 percent of the population uses 70 percent of the resources and 70 percent of the population uses only 30 percent of the resources
 aaj bhi kachche maal kii keemten, vyapaar kii sharte, aarthik aadan-pradaan, takneekee hastantaran aadi sabhi teesri duniya ke deshon ke viruddh hai
 Now the exploitation of these nations is going on indirectly
 aaj bahurashtriya companiyon, aarthik sahaayta, poojinivesh kachche maal kaa aayaat va taiyaar-shuda maal kaa niryaat, doum darje kaa takneekee hastantaran aadi ke madhyam se viksit desh aaj bhi vikasshil rajyon kaa shoshan kar rahe hai
 In the name of various non-essential issues like child labor, environment, human rights etc
, they are still discriminated against in business and other economic relations
 atah in aarthik laabhon ke kaaran shaktishaalee raashtra apane rashtriya hiton kii purti evam sanvardhan kar rahe hai
 War is also used as a final option for the promotion of national interests
 yudhon hetu vibhinn kaaran va iske vibhinn swaroop hote hai
 But in the present age, nations avoid the use of wars due to their firepower and their destructive nature, but this does not mean that wars were abandoned
 badi shaktiyaan aaj bhi apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu iske prayog se nahin chookti hai
 For example, in the present day too, the United States of America, having fought on Afghanistan and Iraq, showed itself to be its only dominant superpower
 atah uparokt sadhano ke madhyam se shaktiyaan apane rashtriya hiton main vruddhi karti rahati he
 This power enhancement is done through a number of assessment elements ranging from peaceful methods to war
 lekin vartmaan antanirbharta ke yug main kuch rashtron ke rashtriya hiton kaa sanvardhan anya rajyon kii keemat par hota he
 That is why nations should also look at the interests of other nations while making the basis of their foreign policy
 isi prakaar rashtriya hiton ke upyog se vishwa main doorgaami va nirantar shanti va suraksha kii sthapana ho sakati he

 karta or karm ke avikari rup main vyanjananth sangyaaon ke ant main kuch boliyon main ek hrasv "u" kii shruti hoti he 
 But of course it is not a complete vowel and linguists find it in the whispering vowel "e" and the eloquent "a"
 sangyaaon ke bahudhaa do rup, hrasv or deergh milte hai
 Apart from these, another form is found in the eastern part of Awadhi region
 avadhi main kahin-kahin khadiboli kaa hrasv rup bilkul lupt ho gaya he; yatha billi, dibbi aadi rup nahin milte belia, dibia aadi hi prachlit hai
 The pronoun has Khadiboli and Braj's "mera Tera" and "mero Tero" forms in Awadhi for "more Tor"
 inke atirikt purvi avadhi main pashchimi avadhi ke "so" "jo" "ko" ke samanaantar "se" "je" "ke" rup praapt hai
 The process of future forms in action is quite different from that of standing

 The future forms in Braj are based on the forms of the ancient future
 
 In Awadhi, often the form of the future is dependent on the ancient forms of poetry
 avadhi kii pashchimi boliyon main keval uttampurush bahuvachan ke rup tavyatant roopon par nirbhar hai
 Like the rest of Braj on the ancient future
 kintu madhyavarti or purvi boliyon main kramash: tavyatant roopon kii prachurtaa badhati gai he
 Khadiboli has the suffix "no" for the noun and "no" in Braj
 parantu avadhi main iske liye "ba" pratyay he 
 In Awadhi, the allegorical singular form ends in "wa"
 bhojpuri main iske sthaan par "l" main ant honevaale rup milte hai 
 One of the main distinguishing features of Awadhi is the past tense form of transitive verb of the other male singular
 ya-"si" main ant honevaale rup avadhi ko chhodkar anyatra nahin milte
 The auxiliary verbs of Awadhi are based on the forms "ha", "ah" and "bata'i"
 upar likhe lakshanon ke anusaar avadhi kii boliyon ke teen varg maane gaye hai : pashchimi, madhyavarti or purvi
 The proximity of the western dialect is due to the influence of Braj and the influence of Bhojpuri on the eastern
 inke atirikt bagheli boli kaa apana alag astitv he
 From the point of view of development, Awadhi is situated between Braj, Kannauji and Bhojpuri
 braj kii vyutpatti nishchay hi shauraseni se tathaa bhojpuri kii magadhi praakrit se hui he
 As Awadhi's position is in between these two, it would be appropriate to assume its exit from the half-century
 khed he ki ardhamagadhi kaa hamen jo pracheenatam rup miltaa he vah paanchavin shatabdi isvi kaa he or usase avadhi ke rup nikaalane main kathinaayee hoti he
 In Pali language, there are often such forms from which the development of Awadhi forms can be proved
 sambhavat: ye rup pracheen ardhamagadhi ke rahe honge
 There are two branches of ancient Awadhi literature: one is Bhaktikavya and the other is Premakhyana poetry
 bhakthikavy main goswami tulsidas kaa "ramcharitamanas" avadhi sahitya kii pramukh kriti he
 Its language is full of Sanskrit vocabulary
 "ramcharitamanas" ke atirikt tulsidas ne anya kai granth avadhi main likhe hai
 Laldas's "awadhbilas" comes under this devotional literature
 isaki rachana sanwat 1700 main hui
 Apart from these, many more devout poets wrote books related to Ramabhakti
 sant kaviyon main baba malukadas bhi avadhi kshetra ke the
 Most of his bani is in Awadhi
 inke shishy baba mathuradas kii bani bhi adhiktar avadhi main he
 Although Baba Dharnidas belonged to Chhapra district, his book was published in Awadhi
 kai anya sant kaviyon ne bhi apane upadesh ke liye avadhi ko apanaaya he
 The most well-known book in Premaakhyan poetry is "padmavat", composed by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, which was composed 34 years before "ramcharitmanas"
 dohe chaupai kaa jo kram "padmavat" main he praaia: vahi "maanas" main miltaa he
 Muslim writers have revealed the secret of Sufism in the Premiakhyan poetry
 is kavy kii parampara kai sau varshon tak chalati rahi
 Manjhan's "madhumalati", Usman's "chitravali", Alam's "madhavanal Kamakandala", Nurmuhammad's "indravati" and Sheikh Nisar's "yusuf Julekha" are compositions of this tradition
 shabdaawalee kii drushti se ye rachanaayen hindu kaviyon ke granthon se is baat main bhinn hai ki isamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii utani prachurtaa nahin he
 Most of the compositions in ancient Awadhi literature are on subjects like patriotism, social reform, and mainly satirical
 kaviyon main pratapanarayan mishra, balbhadra dikshit "padhis", vanshidhar shukla, chandrabhushan dvivedi "ramai kaaka", guru prasad singh "mrigesh" or shardaprasad "bhushundi" vishesh ullekhneey hai
 An important modern text of the manner of "ramcharitmanas" in the tradition of management is the "krishnayana" of Dwarikaprasad Mishra
 isaki bhashaa or style "maanas" ke hi samaan he or granthkaar ne krishnacharit praaia: usee tanmayata or vistaar se likhaa he jis tanmayata or vistaar se tulsidas ne ramcharita ankit kiya he
 Mishra ji has proved through the composition of this book that Awadhi's nature for management is still as attainable as it was in Tulsidas's time

 Descending from Padmama of Hazaribagh, it flows into the northern part of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, joining the Damodar River at Disargarh, Vardaman
 It has a catchment area of 6,159 kimi2 
 The main tributaries, Barsoti and Usri, flow in from the south and north respectively
 Apart from the two main tributaries some fifteen medium / small streams join it
 The Barakar skirts the northern part of Parasnath Hills, the highest hill in the region, located in Giridih district of Jharkhand and a center of Jain pilgrimage
 The river flows in all fury during the rains in its upper reaches and has washed away two bridges constructed successively on the Grand Trunk Road
 The great stone bridge across the river near Barhi, in Hazaribagh district, built around 1848, was washed away in 1913, after a fall of 10 inch of rain in 24 hours
 The narrow iron bridge, which was built to replace it, withstood the strains of troop movement during the Second World War, but gave way in 1946, with another great flood
 a new bridge built in the fifties has withstood the fury of the river
 There is another bridge on the Grand Trunk Road, across the Barakar, connecting Barakar, a small town bearing the same name in Bardhaman district of West Bengal with Chirkunda in Jharkhand
 With heavy traffic in the heart of the coal belt, the bridge built in the mid-19th century is in need of repairs
 a new bridge has been built, to the north, on the bypass running from Kalipahari, before entering Asansol to Nirsa in Dhanbad district
 The huge volume of monsoon water was carried down the valley and used to create havoc with floods in the lower Damodar basin
 Annual rainfall over the basin varies between 765 or 1,607 mimi with an average of 1200 mm of which 80% occurs during the monsoon season from June to September
 In order to harness the river, the Damodar Valley Corporation planned and implemented independent India’s first multipurpose river valley project
 The first dam of the project was constructed across the Barakar at Tilayia
 dvc's first dam, Tilaiya Dam, was across the Barakar at Tilaiya, in Hazaribagh district of Bihar, now in Koderma district of Jharkhand
 It was inaugurated on 21 February 1953
 The dam is 366 meters long and is 30
18 meters high from the river bed level
 Tilaiya hydel power station is located on the left bank of the river Barakar
 The structure is entirely of reinforced concrete
 It has two generating units of 2 MW each with a provision for a third future unit of the same capacity
 dvc’s second dam was across the Konar River, a tributary of the Damodar, in Hazaribagh district, and the third was across the Barakar at Maithon in Dhanbad district of Bihar, now Jharkhand
 The river forms the boundary between West Bengal and Jharkhand in that area
 The dam was inaugurated on 27 sitambar 1957
 The dam is 4,860 meter long and the concrete dam is 43
89 meter high above the river bed level
 The unique feature of Maithon is that the hydel power station is located underground in the left bank of the river and is the first of its kind in India
 The Power Station has a total generating capacity of 60 MW with three units of 20 MW each
 About 13 km downstream from Maithon, the Barakar joins the Damodar at Dishergarh
 Maithon Dam is 48 km from Dhanbad and around 25 km from Asansol
 Other towns such as Rupnarainpur, Chittaranjan and kulti-barakar-neamatpur-dishergarh lie still nearer
 It receives a steady and daily stream of tourists
 In order to augment the meagre hydroelectric power generation DVC has gone in for both gas turbine and thermal power generation
 While most of its facilities for such generation lie in the Damodar region, Maithon in the Barakar regions is a major focal point
 Maithon Gas Turbine Station was commissioned at Maithon in 1989
 The station has an installed capacity of 82
5 MW with three units each of 27
5 MW capacity
 The 2 x 500 MW Maithon Right Bank thermal power station is under implementation
 It is a joint venture of Tata Power and DVC
 a 2 x 500 MW greenfield thermal power station has been proposed for Koderma
 DVC is working on the proposal for a third dam across the Barakar at Balpahari in Jharkhand
 Planned as part of its network of dams and barrages in the valley region, the Balpahari project was conceived with the objective of reducing siltation problems at Maithon, increasing the reach of canal irrigation and adding to hydro-electric generation capacity by 20 MW from the existing 144 MW
 After the construction of the four dams at Tilayia, Konar, Maithon and Panchet by DVC, it was observed that the rate of silt inflow into the reservoirs were much higher than what was anticipated earlier
 It threatened the longevity of the reservoirs
 The catchment area of these reservoirs spread over the undulating terrain of the Chota Nagpur plateau is seriously affected by soil erosion
 Large volume of silt in the form of coarse and fine sediment is removed from the area by erosion under the impact of the water flow caused by torrential rain, which runs down the numerous stream channels during the monsoon
 Thus the problem of reservoir siltation assumed great importance in the case of DVC
 In order to prolong the life of the reservoirs, there was need for soil conservation and silt control
 The reservoirs at Tilaiya and Maithon, provided scope for development of fisheries
 Efforts were made to introduce carps once the water accumulated behind the dams but the results have not been commensurate with the efforts, largely due to the formidable presence of predatory catfish W
 attu and other predators such as Notopterus chitala and Barilius bola at Tilaiya, and catfishes Wallago attu and Aorichthys aor, at Maithon
 These predators take a heavy toll of the stocked carps Trash and uneconomic fishes form dense population at Tilaiya reservoir, competing with major carps for food
 Composition of catch at both the places is: catla, mrigala, rohita and calbasu

 An ordinary person considers it a court where cases arising out of various kinds of industrial legislation are heard, but in reality it is not a court

 In the last two great wars, such courts were established in countries where industries had developed enough
 us samay yah prathit hua ki audyogic vivaadon main samjhaute ke liye ek niyamit saadhan aavashyak he
 The history of industrial disputes-legislation is not as ancient as in other industrialized countries, because industrial strikes were not widely prevalent in this country

 Apart from this, the conditions of the industries in Britain have been different from those prevailing in India
 atev us samay is prakaar ke vichaaron ko chhod dena padaa
 In 1924, there was a widespread strike in the cotton mills of Bombay

 It was the responsibility of the investigating court to investigate the case and submit its report and the Saradhan Mandal should try to get a settlement in that case

 Apart from this, there was no system to stop industrial disputes in the Act

 The Act of 1929 was made permanent by an amendment in 1934
 san 1938 main "shramik vivaad' kii paribhaasha ke sambandh main uparyukt adhinium main phir se sanshodhan kiya gaya
 The amended act also provided that illegal strikes and lockouts should be less restrictive

 In 1938, the Bombay Government passed the Bombay Industrial Disputes Act

 Seeing the success of these wartime rules, the Government of India passed the Industrial disputes-act in 1947 in place of the original Act of 1929
 san 1947 ke adhinium main mukhya vyavasthaayen ye thim : Along with this, the government was also empowered by this Act to appoint a Correctional Officer who can find a way to compromise in industrial disputes and mediate as needed
 sanraadhan adhikari ko yah adhikaar diya gaya ki janopayogi seva vishyak sabhi jhagade anivaary rup se panchpranali dwaara sulajhaayen
 The opinions expressed by the various tribunals under the Act of 1947 were incompatible, as there was no institution to establish contacts between them
 falat: san 1950 main audyogic vivaad adhinium paarit kiya gaya or desh main apili nyaayaadhikrnon kii sthapana kii gai
 These tribunals were empowered to hear appeals against the decisions given by various industrial tribunals

 In the same era, Duncan Forbes's Dictionary of Hindustani was also published
 isamen koshashabdon ko farsi or roman main tathaa arthparyaay angreji main diya gaya he
 The spread of 'A New Hindustani English Dictionary' was edited and published with great labor
 uskaa mahatv is varg ke koshon main sarvaadhik mana gaya
 This is a dictionary composed of the method of modern lexicology, which also has synonyms for synonyms
 isamen udaahrit ansh ek aar to hindustani sahitya se grihith hai dusraa ore lokgeeton ke udhaaharan bhi die gaye hai
 Not only this, the colloquial language and the pure dialects of women have been used here as examples for the first time
 hindustani shabdon ke arthon ko bolchaal kii bhashaa se hi sankalit karke dene kaa prayaas hua he
 The etymological meanings have been given on the basis of the old forms and the metals of some Hindi words have also been determined
 yah kosh vyutpatti kii drushti se bhi mahatvaburna he tathaa udaahranon or tadadhaarit arthnirdesh kii drushti se bhi atyant mahatv rakhata he
 The reason for this is that it has churned the colloquial language and closely mirrored it
 inhone english hindustani kaa bhi kosh taiyaar kiya
 The details of these shells are briefly given below
 gilakraist kii hindustani inglish dictionari, jo apni pracheenta ke kaaran bade mahatv kii he, 1786 main bani thi
 In addition to giving roles, some important language related stories and war stories are also stored in it

 The fourth edition has also compiled words from several poets of the Deccan language
 in koshon kii rachana main dharmaparchaar ke atirikt bhukhya uddeshy tha videshi shashan ke adhikari varg kii bhartiya bhashaa sikhaanaa
 Therefore, these lexicons gave prominence to the colloquial words in order of syllabus and they tried to protect the lexicon in detail from unnecessary compilation of obsolete or obsolete tatadasam or adhvabhav words
 hindustani ke in kuch koshon main adhiktah urdu shabdon kaa praadhanya he or bets tathaa ekaadh or koshkaron ke koshon ko chhodkar praayah sabamein shabd— kram— yojana kaa aadhaar farsi varnmaala he
 Since the basis of the colloquial language was mainly adopted in the circulation of the spread, John T
 Prats paid special attention to the compilation of words used in literary texts of Urdu and Hindi
 padariyon or angreji shaskaon ne nishciya hindi yaa hindustani ke ekabhashi, dwibhashi, koshon or naveen kosh-rachana-paddati kaa pravartan kiya
 People like Lalluji Lal also made trilingual dictionaries

 There was also a war in 1947 between Pakistan and India on this subject
 bharat dwaara is kshetra ko paak adhikrut kashmir kaha jaataa he
 Most international organizations, including the United Nations, MSF, and the Red Cross refer to the region as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 maharaja hari singh, purv kashmir rajya ke maharaja bharat ke tatkaaleen governor general mountbayton ke bharat main vilay ke prastaav ko maan gaye the
 In return for this assistance, India had assured assistance
 is vilay ke uparaant bharat ko tatkaaleen kashmir rajya ke vartmaan bhaag par adhikaar mila
 These occupied territories were found on the eastern side of the current Line of Control, defeating the tribal invaders
 bharat kaa daawa he ki maharaja hari singh se hui sandhi ke parinamswaroop puure kashmir rajya par bharat kaa adhikaar banataa he
 For this reason, India's claim is true over Kashmir

 The basis of Pakistan's claim is the 1933 declaration of Pakistan
 iske anusaar tatkalin jammu evam kashmir rajya bharat ke un paanch uttari rajyon main se ek tha, jinamein se muslim bahumat ke aadhaar par pakistan kii sthapana honi thi
 But India has a different view on this

 ANIAC, an abbreviation for electronic numerical integrator and computer, was the first general-purpose electronic computer
 yah ek purna-turing vaala, digital computer tha jise sanganana kii sampoorn samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye punah programit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Ballistic Research Laboratory, but was first used to calculate hydrogen bombs
 jab 1946 main, ENIAC kii ghoshnaa kii gai tab vah press main "vishalkay mastishk" ke naam se surkiyon main rahaa
 This increased the speed by a thousand times that of electro-mechanical machines, a leap in computing power that no single machine has been able to compare to date
 is ganitiya shakti ne, saamaanya-prayojan programing ke saath yugmit hokar, vaigyanikon or udyogpatiyon ko utsahit kiya
 The inventors encouraged the spread of these new ideas, under which they began teaching a series of lectures on computer architecture
 ENIAC kaa dizin or nirmaan, sanyukt rajya america kii sena dwaara dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan vitt poshit kiya gaya
 On June 5, 1943, a construction contract was signed and secretly started work on the computer at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania from next month under the code name "project PX"

 On 9 November 1946, the ENIAC was closed for the purpose of improving and improving its memory and in 1947 transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland
 jahaan use 29 july 1947 ko punah chaalit kiya gaya or tab se lekar 2 oktober 1955 ke saayam 11:45 baje tak vah satat sanchaalan main rahaa

 shaw, chuan chu, thomas kit sharpalace, arthur burks, harry haski, jaik davis or iredell echus junior The ENIAC was a modular computer, consisting of individual panels for various functions
 in modulon main se bees acumulator the, jo naa keval jod-ghataav karte the balki ek das ankon vaali dashamalav sankhya ko memri main rakhte the
 The numbers were passed between these units on a number of general purpose buses, or trays
 apni ucch gati ko praapt karne ke liye, panelon ko sankhya bhejnaa or praapt karnaa, gananaa karnaa, jawaab ko rakshit karnaa or agali kriya ko shuru karnaa hota tha or yah sab vah bina kisi chalyman bhaag ke karata tha
 His ability to spread was the key to his versatility; He undertook various tasks dependent on the markings of a calculation result
 gati ke alaava, ENIAC kii sabase ullekhneey baat thi uskaa aakaar or jatilta
 ENIAC main shaamil the 17,468 vaikum tub, 7200 crystal diod, 1500 riley, 70,000 racister, 10,000 kapesiter or lagbhag 5 million haath se jode hue jod
 iskaa vajan 30 short ton tha, lagbhag 8
5 bata 3 bata 80 feet kaa tha, 680 varg feet jagah letaa tha or 150 kilowat bijli kii khapat karata tha
 Input was possible from an IBM card reader and an IBM card punch was used for output
 in cardon ko ek IBM lekhankan mashin kii sahaayta se ofline sthiti main mudrit output utpaadit karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he, jiskaa ek udhaaharan he IBM 405
 ENIAC used a ten-position ring calculator to store digits; Each numeral used 36 vacuum tubes, 10 of which were double triodes that made up the flip-flops of the ring scorer
 ankaganit ko ring ganak dwaara pulse ko "ginate" hue puraa kiya jaataa tha or yadi pulse "lipat jaataa" tha to kairi pulse ko utpann karata tha, iske peeche vichaar yah tha ki yantric ading mashin ke ank chakra ke prachaalan ko electronics main hasil kiya ja sake
 The ENIAC had ten-digit marked accumulators that used a complementary display of ten and could perform 5,000 normal additions or subtractions between a source and any of them every second
 kai acumulatoron ko ek saath chalaane ke liye jodna sambhav ho gaya tha, isliye kaary kii tivratam gati sambhawatah samanaantar kaary ke kaaran bahut adhik thi
 It was possible to move the carry of one accumulator to another accumulator to perform dual precision, arithmetic with the help of a wire, but the accumulator carry circuit restricts the addition of three or more wires for higher precision
 ENIAC ne acumulatoron main se chaar kaa istemaal kiya, jo ek vishesh multiplir ikai dwaara niyantrit the, taaki vah prati second 385 tak gunan kaary kar sake
 ENIAC also used five of the accumulators, which were controlled by a special divider / numeric unit, to perform forty parts or three square-root operations per second
 ENIAC main anya nau ikai inishiating unit, cycling unit, master programmer, reader, printer, kanstant transmeter, or teen fungshan tebles 
 The references by Rozas and Hashagen give more details about the timing of the work, which is somewhat different from the descriptions above
 mul mashin chakra 200 microsecond, yaa 10-ank sankhya par kaary karne ke liye 5,000 chakra prati second tha
 In one of these cycles, ENIAC could write a number on a register, read a number from a register, or add / subtract two numbers
 10-ankiy sankhya kaa gunan ek d -ank sankhya d +4 chakra letaa tha, aise hi ek 10 dwaara 10-ank kaa gunan 14 chakra, yaa 2800 microsecond-357 prati second kaa ek dar letaa he
 If one of the numbers was less than 10 digits, the work was faster
 bhagaganit or varg mul ne 13 chakra liya, jisamen d parinaam main ankon kii sankhya he
 So a quadratic or numeral would take up to the original 143 cycles, or 28,600 microseconds — 35 per second
 yadi parinaam main das ankon se kam ho, to ve teji se praapt hote the
 The ENIAC used the common octal radio tubes of those days; Decimal accumulators were made of 6SN7, flip-flop, while 6l7s, 6sj7s, 6sa7s and 6ac7s were used in logic functions
 kai 6l6s or 6v6s ne line driver ke rup main kaary kiya taaki palson ko rack asembli ke bich ke cabalon ke madhyam se paar kiya ja sake
 Some electronics experts predicted that the tube would often malfunction due to which the machine would never be useful
 yah purvanumaan aanshik rup se sahi niklaa: lagbhag prayek din kai tub jal jate the, jiske falswaroop vah aadhe samay kaary karne yogya nahin rahata tha
 Special high-reliability tubes were not available until 1948
 haalanki, in kharabiyon main se adhikansh warm-ap or kool-down samay ke dauraan hue, jab tub heater or cathod sabase adhik thermal tanaav main rahete the
 With the simple tip of never closing the machine, the engineers reduced the fear of defect in ENIAC tubes to one tube per two days rate, which was more acceptable
 1989 main ekirt ke saath ek saakshaatkaar ke anusaar lagaataar kharaab hote tub kii kahaniyaan zyaadaatar ek myth thi: "lagbhag har do din main ek tub kharaab hoti thi or ham 15 minute main samasya ko pahchaan lete the
 "in 1954, the longest continuous operation time without malfunction was 116 hours
 chunki belistic anusandhan prayogshaala is teen varshiya pariyojna ke dauraan ek varsh ENIAC kaa praayojak rahaa ek ganitagya jon won neuman, jo los ellamos main ek hydrogen bam par kaam kar rahe the, ko is computer ke bare main pataa chal gaya
 Los Alamos then became so involved with the ENIAC that the first problem test run on it was calculations for hydrogen bombs rather than artillery tables
 is test ke liye input / output ek million card tha
 ENIAC could be programmed for complex sequences of operations, which could include loops, branches, and subroutines
 ek samasya ko lene or mashin par maanchitran kaa kaary jatil tha or aamtaur par isamen kai saptaah lag jate the
 After the program was made on paper, it took a few more days for the program to be "inside" the ENIAC through switches and wiring manipulations
 iske baad satyaapan or doshamarjan kii ek avadhi chali, jisamen saath thi mashin ko "single step" karne kii kshamta
 The six women who were inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 1997 did most of the programming for ENIAC
 1946 main ve ek duusare ko jis naam se bulaati thim, vah tha ke mcnlati, betty jenings, betty sneader, marlin vesco, fran bilas or ruth licharman

 The ENIAC was the only design of its type and was never repeated
 1943 main iske dizin par lagi pratibandh kaa matlab tha ki computer ke dizin main kuch nawacharon kaa abhaav jo jald hi acchhee tarah se viksit ho gaya, vishesh rup se ek program ko sangrahit karne kii asamarthta
 ekirt or mauchli ne ek nae dizin par kaam shuru kiya, jo aage chal kar EDVAC, ke naam se janaa gaya, jo adhik saral hone ke saath hi adhik shaktishaalee bhi hoga
 Specifically, in 1944 Eckert wrote his account of a memory unit that could hold both data and programs
 jon won neuman, jo EDVAC par moore skool ke liye paraamarsh kar rahe the, moore skool ke baithkon main bhaag liya jisamen sangrahit program avadharana ko savistaar bataaya gaya or unhone noton kaa ek adhuraa set likhaa jise ek aantarik gyaapan ke rup main prayog karne ke uddeshy se banaaya gaya tha or jisamen baithak main viksit hue vichaaron kaa varnan, vistaaran or nirupan ek aupchaarik taarkik bhashaa main kiya gaya
 Herman Goldstein distributed copies of the First Draft to government and educational institutions, leading to widespread interest in manufacturing new generation electronic computing machines such as EDSAC and SEAC
 1948 se ENIAC main kai sudhaar bhi kiye gaye, jisamen ek pracheen read-only sangrahit programing tantra shaamil tha jiske liye program ROM ko fungashan tebles ke rup main prayog kiya gaya, yah vichaar BLR ke dow richard clipinger dwaara swatantra rup se prastaavit or ENIAC ke patent main shaamil kiya gaya
 Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on implementing the set of instructions
 clipinger ne ek 3-adress vaastukala ke vishay main sochaa, jabaki won neuman ne 1-adress vaastukala kaa prastaav rakhaa kyonki vah lagu karne ke liye aasaan tha
 a three-digit program calculator was used as a calculator, another accumulator was used as the main accumulator, a third accumulator was used as an address pointer to read data from the work table, and Most of the other accumulators were used for data memory
 ENIAC ke liye sangrahit program kii programing betty jenings, clipinger or adel goldstine dwaara kii gai thi
 On 16 September 1948, it was displayed as a stored-program computer, with a program by Adele Goldstein for John von Neumann
 is sanshodhan ne ENIAC kii gati ko chah ke ganak se kam kar diya or samanaantar gananaa kii kshamta ko samaapt kar diya, lekin chunki isane punah programing ke samay ko dinon se gata kar ghanton main simit kar diya, iske kharaab pradarshan ko uchit mana gaya
 Analyzes showed that due to the distinction between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input / output , almost any real-world problem was completely i / o based, even without using the original machine's parallelism
 And most of them will be i / o based even after the speed reduction by this modification
 1952 ke purvardh main, ek ucch-gati shiftor ko joda gaya, jisane sthanantaran ke gati ko paanch ke ganak se sudhara
 july 1953 main, ek 100 shabd vistaar kor memri, dwiadhari kodit dashamalav, atirikt-3 sankhya prasatutikaran kaa upyog karke pranali main joda gaya
 To support this extension memory, ENIAC was equipped with some function table selectors, memory address selectors and pulse shaping circuits, and three new commands were added to the programming arrangement

 The Z3 and the Colossus were developed independently of each other and from the ABC and ENIAC during World War II
 Z3, 1943 main, berlin ke ellide bambaari ke dauraan nasht ho gaya
 Colossus machines were a part of Britain's war effort and were dismantled in 1945 to maintain secrecy
 unke astitv kii jaankaree 1970 ke dashak main aam hui, haalanki unki kshamtaaon kaa gyaan unke britain ke karmchaariyon or aamantrit americanyon ke bich main rahaa
 The ABC was demolished by Iowa State University, after John Atanasoff was called to Washington DC to do physics research in the US Navy
 iske vipareet, ENIAC ko 1946 main press ke samaksh pareekshan ke liye rakhaa gaya, "or isane duniya kii kalpana par kabja kar liya"
 isliye computing ke puraane itihaas apane kawarej or is avadhi ke vishleshan main vyapak nahin bhi ho sakate the
 For several reasons, the US Patent 3,120,606 granted in 1964 to ENIAC was invalidated in a 1973 landmark federal court ruling in the case of Honeywell v
 Sperry Rand, placing electronic digital computers under public jurisdiction and Attanasoff Was given legal recognition as the inventor of the first electronic digital computer
