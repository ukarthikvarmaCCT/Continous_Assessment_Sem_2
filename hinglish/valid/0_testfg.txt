 samudri pani ke diselination sanyantron kaa ek pramukh paryaavarniya chintan kaa vishay khule samudri pani ko pine se hone vaala prabhaav he, visheshkar jab ye bijli ke sanyantron ke paas sthit hote hai
 Many of the proposed initial plans for seawater plants relied on the effects of drinking, rather than focusing on the effects on marine life

 If the power plant is of medium to large size and the desalination plant is not huge, then the cold water flow of the power plant will be much higher than that of the desalination plant
 Another method of reducing the increase in salinity is to spread the salty water over a much larger area so that there is only a slight increase in salinity
 For example, once a saline water pipeline reaches the sea level, it may split into several branches, each of which can slowly release saline water through small holes located in its length
 is vidhi ko sanyukt rup se namakeen pani ko bijli ke sanyantr yaa apshisht jal sanyantr se nikalne vaale pani main mila kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Deep seawater has the potential to damage ecosystems, particularly marine areas that already have excessive salinity due to low sedimentation and high evaporation
 aise sthanon ke udaahranon main faras kii khadi, laal sagar or vishesh rup se, atol ke coral lagoon or duniya bhar main sthit anya ushnkaribandheey dweep hai
 Because saline water is denser than the surrounding seawater because of the high amount of dissolved matter, releasing it into the sources of water means endangering the ecology of the source of water as the salty water sinks and the ecological damage Remains long to deliver
 saavdhaanee se punah shuruuaat is samasya ko kam kar sakati he
 For example, water officials at the desalination plant and marine outlet structures, built in Sydney in 2007, stated that marine outlets would be located at extremely high sea depths that would increase the dispersal of dense water in such a way that 50 to 75 of the outlet points It will not be possible to distinguish between this and normal seawater in the range of meters
 Sydney is fortunate to have special ocean conditions located off its coastline that rapidly reduce dense by-products, reducing the damage to the environment

 The project was delayed due to bankruptcy of Paysden Resources' successive partners Stone & Webster in the venture, followed by Coventa and its major subcontractor Hydronautics
 Pysaidon's relationship with Stone & Webster, through S&W Water LLC, ended in June 2000 when Stone & Webster was declared bankrupt and Pisaidon Resources purchased Stone & Webster's stake in S&W Water LLC
 Pisaiden Resources partnered with Coventa and Hydronautics in 2001, changing the name of the association to Tempa Bay Castle
 Due to Coventa's inability to complete the construction of the project, on 15 May 2002 the Tempa Bay Water Agency was forced to purchase the project from Pisaiden and finance the project under its credit rating

 On the contrary, soft X-rays are said to be able to penetrate a substance with great difficulty; For example, the attenuation length of an X-ray with 600 electro volts wavelength in water is less than 1 micrometer
 eks-re ek prakaar kaa insheel vikiran hai or inkaa anaavaran swasthya ke liye hanikaarak ho saktaa he
 The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed in recent decades
 multah, eks-re naliyon se utsarjit hone vaale vidyut chumbakeey vikiran kaa tarangadairghy radiodharmee nabhik se utsarjit vikiran ke tarangadairghy se lanbaa tha
 The ancient literature established a distinction between x and gamma radiation based on wavelengths where radiation, defined as gamma rays, was smaller than a unilateral wavelength, such as 10–11 m
 haalanki, apekshaakrit chote tarangadairghy vaale satat spectrum "eks-re" sroton, jaise - raikhik twarakon or apekshaakrit lambey tarangadairghy vaale "gamma kiran" utsarjakon kii khoj hone ke kaaran tarangadairghy ke samooh bade paimaane par paraspar aachhadit ho gaye
 Nowadays, generally, two types of radiation are distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons located outside the nucleus while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus
 eks-re kii insheel kshamta kii maap ko anaavaran kaha jaataa he: However, the effect of ionizing radiation on matter is much more closely related to the amount of energy deposited in them than the charge produced
 is avashoshit urja kii maap ko avashoshit maatra kaha jaataa he: Equivalent volume is the measurement of the biological effects of radiation on human tissue
 jahaan tak eks-re kaa sawaal he, yah avashoshit maatra ke baraabar hota he
 Medical X-rays are an important source of man-made radiation exposure, with a magnitude of 58% in the United States in 1987, but since most radiation exposures are natural, the magnitude of medical X-rays is higher than the total US radiation exposure
 It is only 10 percent
 danta eks-re kii vajah se suchit maatra kaaphi bhinn dikhaai detii he
 Depending on the source, a specific dental X-ray of a human would probably result in an exposure of 3, 40, 300, or at most 900 emrames
 eks-re, eks-re nalee se utpann hoti hai, jo ek ucch veg ke liye ek garm cathod dwaara mukt electronon kii gati badhaane ke liye ek ucch voltage kaa prayog karne vaali ek vaikum tub he
 High-velocity electrons collide with a metallic target called the anode, creating an X-ray

 When electrons hit the target, X-rays are formed by two different atomic processes: isliye ek nalee ke parinami utpaada main nalee ke voltage par shunya tak girane vaala ek satat bramlestrolang varnakram or saath main abhilakshanik rekhaon par kai spike hote hai
 The voltage used in clinical X-ray tubes and thus the highest energy of X-rays is about 20 to 150 kv
 chikitsiya naidanik anuprayogon main, kam urja vaali eks-re avaanchit hoti hai kyonki sharir unhen puri tarah avashoshit kar letaa he, jisase maatra badhaane kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, a thin metallic sheet, often an aluminum sheet or sheet, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed on the window of the X-ray tube, which filters the low-energy components in the spectrum
 ise beam kaa sakhtikaran kehete hai
 Both of these processes of producing X-rays are very inefficient, their output capacity is only around one percent and, therefore, the electric power that can be entered as input, to produce a usable current of X-rays a high percentage of k is released as waste heat
 eks-re nalee kaa dizin aisa hona chahie ki yah is atirikt ooshmaa ko failaa sake
 Radiographs obtained using X-rays can be used to identify a broader spectrum of pathology

 To make an image of an X-ray of human or animal bones, short X-rays flutter illuminate the body or part and a radiographic film is placed behind it
 upasthit koi bhi asthiyaan prakaash vidyut prakriyaaon dwaara eks-re ke adhikansh photon ko avashoshit kar leti hai
 This is because bones have a higher electron density than soft tissues
 bvfget X-rays are detected based on various methods
 sabase adhik aam taur par jane jane vaale tareeke - photographic plate, casette main photographic film or durlabh prithvi screen hai
 They are all classified as "image receptors" regardless of the elements involved in the image
 digital computer ke aagaman or digital imaging ke avishkaar se pehle adhikansh radiographic chitra utpann karne ke liye photographic platon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 These paintings were produced entirely on glass plates
 photographic filmon ne bade paimaane par in platon kii jagah le lee or chikitsiya chitron ko utpann karne ke liye eks-re prayogshaalaon main iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 In more recent years, computerized and digital radiography is being used in place of photographic film in medical and dental applications, although film technology is still widely used in industrial radiography processes
 Photographic plates are mostly a matter of history, and the "intensifying screen" that replaces them is also becoming dull in history
 dhaatu chaandi ek gaiyr navikarniya sansaadhan he
 It is thus profitable that it is now being replaced by digital and computerized technology
 jahaan photographic filmon ke liye geeli prasanskaran suvidhaon kii jarurat padati thi, vahiin in nai praudyogikiyon ke liye yah sab jaruri nahin he
 Digital storage of images using these new technologies also saves storage space
 chunki photographic plate, eks-re ke prati samvedansheel hote hai, atah ve chitra ko record karne kaa ek saadhan pradaan karte hai, lekin unhen bahut zyada eks-re anaavaran kii bhi jarurat padati he, isliye intencyfoing screen ko taiyaar kiya gaya
 They provide a much lower volume to the patient, as the screen receives X-rays and increases its intensity, so that it can be recorded on film placed next to the intensifying screen
 rogi ke jis ang se eks-re ko pravaahit karnaa he, use eks-re strot or image receptor ke bich rakhaa jaataa he jisase sharir ke keval usee vishesh ang kii aatanrik sanrachana kii chaaya utpann ho sake

 In the search for a non-toxic contrast material, several types of high atomic number elements were evaluated
 udaahranarth, hamaare purvajon ne pehali baar jis nirupan kaa prayog kiya, vah chaak tha or iskaa prayog ek shav kii nalikaaon par kiya gaya tha
 Unfortunately, some selected elements proved to be harmful - for example, thorium was used as a means of representation - which in some cases became toxic
 Modern formulations have improved, and while there is no way to determine who has sensitivity to the formulation, the incidence of "allergic reactions" is very low

 Initially, the most common detection methods were based on ionization of gases, such as in the Geiger – Müller counter: a sealed volume, typically a cylinder, with a gas, cylindrical cathode in a mica, polymer or thin metallic window, and a wire is anode; High voltage is passed between the cathode and the anode
 jab ek eks-re photon silinder main pravesh karti he, to yah gaiyr kaa ynikaran karti he or yanon va electronon kaa nirmaan karti he
 In this process, electrons move rapidly towards the anode, leading to further ionization along their trajectory

 These are called "flow counters"
 sodium iodide jaise kuch padaarth ek eks-re photon ko ek drishyman photon main "badal" sakate hai; ek photomultiplir jodakar ek electronic detector kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 These detectors are called "scintillators", filmscreens or "scintillation counters"
 inke upyog kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki rogi par eks-re kii bahut kam maatra pravaahit karne par bhi ek paryaapt chitra praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays have also been used in contrasting studies of hollow organs or in "real-life" procedures such as angiography using fluorescence obtained using an X-ray image intensifier

 photodod par prahaar karne vaale photon, vidyut aavesh ke do vaahakon main roopantarit ho jate hai, jinhen electron-chhidr yugma kaha jaataa he
 Since the number of charge carriers generated will vary with the intensity of the incoming light photon, an electrical method is created that can rapidly convert to a voltage and then into a digital signal, which can be converted into a digital signal by a computer
 Is adapted to produce digital images
 haalanki silicon main utkrisht electronic gun hote hai, lekin phir bhi yah vishesh rup se eks-re ke photon kaa ek acha avasorak nahin he
 For this reason, X-rays first fall on a scintillator made of materials such as gadolinium oxysulfide or cesium iodide
 cintilator, eks-re ko avashoshit kar unhen drishy prakaash photon main badal detaa he jo uske baad photodod sarini par se gujarata he
 X-rays generally considered invisible to the human eye can be viewed under special circumstances

 To put the increased risk in perspective, a normal X-ray or dental X-ray of the chest will expose an individual to an equal amount of background radiation, to which we are exposed daily in a 10-day timeframe
 aisi prayek eks-re sampurna jivan-kaal main cancer ke jokhim main 1 prati 1,000,000 se bhi kam kii vruddhi karegi
 a abdominal or chest CT would be equivalent to 2–3 years of background radiation, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 10,000 and 1 per 1,000
 ye sankhya hamaare jeevankaal ke dauraan kisi bhi cancer ke viksit hone kii lagbhag 40% sambhaavna kii tulana main bahut kam he
 Children exposed to clinical X-rays are more likely to develop it in children who are exposed to leukemia, especially if the exposure is too close to conception or two or more of the lower gastrointestinal tract or lower abdomen X-rays are included

 From the recommendations of the Second International Congress of Radiology, the following table gives the address of the recommended thickness of the glass shield in the work of X-ray energy
 eks-re ke anya ullekhneey upyogon main shaamil hai The discoverer of X-rays is generally credited to the German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen because he was the first to study them systematically, although he is not the first to see its effects
 "eks-re" ke rup main unka namakaran bhi unhone hi kiya he, haalanki unki khoj ke baad kai dashakon tak kuch log unhen "rontagan kirnon" ke rup main sanderbhit karte the
 Scientists investigating cathode rays, ie energetic electrons, produced in tubes for the first time around 1875 saw X-rays emanating from experimental immersion tubes called the Crux tube
 crukes naliyaan, kuch kilovolt or 100 kevi ke bich kahin bhi ek ucch disi voltage dwaara nalee main avshisht hawa ke ynikaran ke dwaara mukt electronon kaa nirmaan karti thim
 These voltages greatly accelerated the movement of electrons coming from the cathode at high velocities, creating X-rays when they hit the glass wall or anode of the tube
 kai aarambhik crukes naliyaan beshak eks-re ko vikeern karti thim, kyonki aarambhik shodhakartaaon ne un prabhaavon ko dekha tha jinka shrey unhen diya ja saktaa tha, jiskaa vistrut vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Wilhelm Röntgen was the first to systematically study them in 1895
 evan pului, wiliam crukes, johaan wilhem hitorf, uzen goldstin, henrich hertz, philip lenard, harman won helmholtz, nicola testla, thomas edison, charles glover barkla, maiks won loe or wilhem conred rontagan kii ginati eks-re ke pramukh aarambhik shodhakartaaon main kii jaati he
 The German physicist Johann Hittorf, known as a co-inventor and early researcher of the Crux tube, noticed photographic plates exposed to the tube when he noticed that some of the plates had been cracked by the shadow, although he noticed this effect Did not investigate ukraine main janme or uniwarsity of vienna main prayogtmak bhautikee ke vyaakhyaata ke rup main karyrat pului ne vaikum discharge tub ke gunon kii jaanch karne ke liye unke anek dizine taiyaar kiye
 Even after his appointment to the post of professor at Prague Polytechnic, he continued his work, and in 1886 he noticed that sealed photographic plates darkened when exposed to substances coming out of the tubes
 1896 ke aarambhik daur main, rontagan dwaara apni pehali eks-re tasviir prakashit karne ke bas kuch saptaah baad, pului ne paris or landan kii patrikaon main ucch-gunvattta vaale eks-re chitron ko prakashit kiya
 Although Puluyi studied with Röntgen at the University of Strasbourg from the years 1873 to 1875, his biographer Guida claims that his subsequent research was done independently
 april 1887 main, nicola testla ne ucch voltage or khud dizin kii gai naliyon ke saath-saath crukes naliyon kaa upyog karke eks-re kii jaanch kerani shuru kii
 His technical publications indicate that he had invented and developed a special single electrode X-ray tube that was different from other X-ray tubes with no target electrode

 By 1892, Tesla conducted many such experiments, but did not classify these emissions, which were later known as X-rays
 testla ne is ghatana ko "adrishy" prakaar kii vikiran urja ke rup main samanyikrut kiya
 Tesla, in his 1897 X-ray lecture in front of the New York Academy of Sciences, described the facts of his methods concerning various experiments
 iske alaava isi vyaakhyaan main testla ne eks-re upkaran ke nirmaan or surakshit sanchaalan kii vidhi kaa varnan kiya
 Through his X-ray experimentation by vacuum high field emission, he also alerted the scientific community to the biological hazards associated with X-ray exposure

 His letter to The Physical Review, dated January 6, 1893, was duly published and published in San Francisco Examiner, an article entitled Without Lenses or Light, Photographs Taken with Plate and Object in Darkness
 henrich hertz kaa philip lenard naamak ek chaatr yah dekhnaa chahta tha ki cathod kirane, hawa main crukes nalee se hokar guzar sakati hai yaa nahin
 He built a crux tube at the end of which was a "window" made of thin aluminum with its front side facing the cathode so that the cathode rays could hit it
 unhone dekha ki usamen se kuch niklaa jiske photographic platon ke prati anaavruth kii vajah se pratidipti utpann hui
 He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various substances
 It has been reported that at least some of these "lenard rays" were actually X-rays
 harman won helmholtz ne eks-re ke ganitiya samikarnon ko sutarabaddh kiya
 He conceived a scattering theory before Röntgen's discovery and announcement
 ise prakaash ke vidyut chumbakeey siddhant ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 However, he did not work with real X-rays
 8 navambar 1895 ko lenard or crukes naliyon ke saath prayog karte samay german bhautikee professor wilhem rontagan kaa saamana eks-re se hua or unhone in par adhyayan karnaa shuru kar diya
 He produced an initial report titled "on a New Kind of Ray: a Preliminary Communication" and on 28 December 1895 he submitted the report to the Journal of the physical-medical Society of Würzburg
 eks-re par likhaa gaya yah pehla shodh-patr tha
 Röntgen referred to the radiation as "X" to inform that it was an unknown type of radiation
 yah naam isse jud gaya, haalanki unke kai sahyogiyon ne un kirnon kaa namakaran rontagan kirnon ke rup main karne kaa suzav diya tha
 They are still referred to by similar names in many languages, including German
 rontagan ko apni khoj ke liye bhautikee main pratham nobel puraskaar praapt hua
 There are considerable differences in the details of his discovery as Röntgen burned his lab notes at the time of his death, but this may have been the concoction of his biographers: Röntgen, a crux tube and a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide
 With cathode rays attached to it, which they wrapped in a black curboard so that the visible light emitted from the tube interfered Do not
 He saw a misty green glow emanating from the screen at about 1 meter distance
 He felt that some invisible rays from the tube were passing through the cardboard, which caused the curtain to glow
 unhone paaya ki ve unki mej par rakhi kitabon or kaagajon se hokar bhi guzar sakati thi
 Röntgen immediately began systematically investigating these unknown rays
 apni praarambhik khoj ke do maheene baad, unhone apana shodh-patr prakashit kiya
 Röntgen discovered its medical use by looking at a picture of his wife's hand made by X-rays on a photographic plate

 In 1895, Thomas Edison investigated the ability of substances to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, and found calcium tungstate to be the most effective of these substances
 march 1896 ke aasapaas, unke dwaara viksit kiya gaya fluoroscope, chikitsiya eks-re ke pareekshanon ke liye ek maanak ban gaya
 Nevertheless, Edison discontinued X-ray research around 1903 after the death of one of his glassblowers named Clarence Madison Dali

 i approve of your decision
 phir british leftinent governor maaykele o diar ne amritsar or anya kshetron main marshall lau lagane kii maang kii jise vysaroy lord chamsford nen sweekrut kar diya
 The massacre led to worldwide condemnation, under whose pressure the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montague, appointed the Hunter Commission in late 1919 to investigate it
 kamishan ke saamne brigadier general rejinold diar ne sweekaar kiya ki vah goli chalaa kar logon ko maar dene kaa nirnay pehle se hi le kar vahaan gaya tha or vah un logon par chalaane ke liye do topein bhi le gaya tha jo ki us sankare raste se nahin ja pai thim
 Brigadier General Reginald Dyer was demoted to colonel in 1920 and placed on the inactive list when the Hunter Commission's report came

 As a result, Gandhi started the non-cooperation Movement in 1920
 jab jaliyanvaala baag main yah hatyakand ho rahaa tha, us samay udhamsingh vahiin maujuud the or unhen bhi goli lagi thi
 He decided that he would avenge it

 kisi chaalak kii vaidyut dharita, us chaalak kii vaidyut aavesh kaa sangrahan karne kii kshamta kii maap hoti he
 When a conductor is charged, its electrical potential increases in proportion to the charge
 yadi kisi chaalak ko q aavesh dene par uske vibhav main v vruddhi ho, to Where c is a constant whose value depends on the size of the driver, the adjacent medium and the presence of other drivers nearby
 is niyatank ko 'vaidyut dharita' kehete hain
 From the above equation q = CV is prakaar, kisi chaalak kii vaidyut dharita chaalak ko diye gayi aavesh tathaa chaalak ke vibhav main hone vaali vriddhi ke anupaat ko kehete hain
 The SI unit of capacitance is coulom / volt
 ise 'fared' kehete he tathaa ise f se nirupit karte hai
 Like this, dharita kaa emu main maatrak ‛state fared’ hota he
 Similarly from c = q / v- yadi v=1volt, C=q to kisi chaalak kii vaidyut dharita chaalak ko di gayi aavesh kii vah maatra he jo chaalak ke vibhav main ek volt kaa parivartan kar de
 Legal holdings are a scalar amount
 vaidhut dharita kaa maan sadaiv dhanatmak hota he
 Because the charge on the driver and because of it, there are signs of change in voltage
 dharita kaa vimiya sutara - he
 The capacitance also increases as the reflectivity of the conductor medium increases
 kisi chaalak kii dharita nimna tathyon par nirbhar nahin karti he- Note - If the formula c = q / v to v = 0 then c = ∞ so the capacitance will be infinite
 chunki prithvi kaa vibhav 0 hota he
 So the capacity of the earth will be eternal
 atah prathvi anant aavesh sangruhit kar sakati he
 Similarly, when we charge a conductor, the numerical value of the potential of the conductor increases
 yadi chaalak ko aavesh lagaataar dete jaye to chaalak sthatij urja kaa sanchay nahin kar pataa arthath vaidhut rodhan kshamta samaapt ho jaati he
 And the charge starts leaking
 is sthiti main vibhav kaa maan adhiktam hota he
 And thus it is possible to collect a certain amount of charge by the driver
 isi kaa paroksh udhaaharan yah he kii jab ham khaali bartan ko jal main daalate he to bartan main pani nishchit maatra tak hi bad pataa he or pani taduparant bartan se baahar aane lagata he
 This is called the capacity of the vessel
 ise millilitre, litre aadi se vyakt karte he
 When a driver is charged, it is given in a split form
 atah chaalak par purv sanchit aavesh ke kaaran bahya aavesh dene par vaidhut pratikarshan bal ke viruddh kaary kiya jaataa he
 This function is stored in the conductor as legitimate static energy
 jo chaalak kii sthatij urja kehalaati he
 Suppose the capacitance of the conductor is C
 Initially the charge on the conductor is q and the voltage v is zero
 mana chaalak ko aavesh vibhajit rup main diya jaataa he jisase vibhav kaa maan bhi badhata he
 With the charge q and the value of v also increases, hence the average potential- vaidhut vibhav kii paribhaasha se,aaveshairi dene par vibhav parivartan hone ke saath kiya gaya kaary se- Since the work itself is stored as static energy in the conductor, then - c=q / v se sameekaran main q tathaa v ke maan rakhane par- Note- Question- Why the work done is stored as static energy
 kaary kaa urja se kya sambandh he
 Answer: The ability to work is called energy
 tathaa kaary va urja kaa maatrak bhi ‛jul’ saamaan he
 This element can be proved by mathematics that the amount of energy we put into an instrument is not more than the amount of work we get
 yahi shaktisatatya kaa niyam he
 So now it can also be said that by doing any work, we can store the same amount of energy in a machine
 yahi aadhunik rup main kaary-urja prameya dwaara siddh kiya ja saktaa he
 The work that one has to study while compressing a spring is the energy stored in that spring
 jise sthitij urja kehete he
 Therefore, energy is born through some work
 tathaa koi bhi kaary kisi urja dwaara hi sambhav he
 Whether a particular -1 driver is positive or negatively, legitimate state energy is always positive
 2 yadi c va C' dhaarit vaale do chalko ke liye- Hence, the higher the potential energy of the driver of higher capacitance
 atah kam dharita ke chaalak kii vaidhut sthatij urja adhik hogi

 ganit or computer vigyaan main, hexadesimal ek sthetiya ank pranali he jiske ek mulank yaa aadharank kaa maan 16 hota he
 It uses sixteen different symbols in which symbols 0 to 9 represent values from zero to nine and symbols A, B, C, D, E, f display values from ten to fifteen
 We do
 udhaaharan ke liye, hexadesimal sankhya 2AF3 kaa maan dashamik sankhya pranali main + + + yaa 10,995 ke baraabar hota he
 Each hexadecimal digit, also called four binary digits) is represented, and hexadecimal notation is used in computing and digital electronics as a human-friendly representation of binary coded values
 udhaaharan ke liye, bit ke maan 0 se 255 tak ho saktaa he lekin iske maanon ko or suvidhajanak bhang se 00 se lekar FF tak vaale do hexadesimal akon ke rup main pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses
 saanchaa:hexadecimal tablejina paristhitiyon main reference kaa abhaav hota he, un paristhitiyon main anya mul ankon main vyakt kii gai sankhyaon ke saath ek hexadesimal sankhya aspasht or bhraamak ho sakati he
 There are many ways of expressing values clearly
 ek sankhyatmak sabscript mul ank ko spasht rup se vyakt kar saktaa he: 15910, dashamal 159 he; 15916 hexadesimal 159 he, jiskaa maan 34510 ke baraabar hota he
 Other authors prefer to use a text subscript, such as 159 decimal and 159 hex, or 159d and 159h
 rekhiy paath pranalion, jaise - adhikansh computer programing pariveshon main istemaal kii jaani vaali pranaaliyon, main vibhinn prakaar ke tareekon kaa aagaman hua he: # x and # 16r are used as prefixes

 In the early history of computers, the choice of letters from a to f to display digits above nine was not universal
 1950 ke dashak ke dauraan, 10 se 15 tak ke maanon ko suchit karne ke liye ek macrone kairactor ke saath 0 se lekar 5 tak ke ankon kaa istemaal karne par kuch pratishthapan kaary anukool sabit hue
 bendix ji-15 computer upyogkarta u se lekar z tak ke aksharon kaa upyog karte the
 Bruce A
 of Brookhaven National Laboratory Martin considered the option of using a to f to be "ridiculous" and in a letter to the CACM editor in 1968, he proposed the use of a whole new set of symbols based on bit locations that were not accepted enough
 
 das se pandrah tak kii matraaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye koi paaramparik ank uplabdh nahin he—inaki jagah aksharon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he—or adhikansh pashchimi europea bhashaaon main das se upar ke ankon ke liye gaiyr-dashamalav naamon kaa abhaav he
 In spite of the many non-decimal powers in English and the accessibility of names for Great Gross, no English name describes hexadecimal powers
 kuch log hexadesimal sankhyaon ke ek-ek ank ko ek phone number kii tarah padhate hai: 4DA ko "four-di-e" padhate hai
 However, a sounds like the letter "at", c sounds like "three", and d can easily sound like the "-ty" suffix: is it 4D or forty? Others avoid getting confused by using the NATO phonetic alphabet: 4DA is "four-delta-alpha"; Or Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet; Or a similar ad hoc system
 binary or hexadesimal donon ke liye ankon kii ginati karne kii pranaaliyon kii yojana banaai gai he
 Arthur C
 Clarke suggested using each finger as an on / off bit, facilitating the use of the finger to count from zero to 1023 on ten fingers
 FF tak kii ginati karne ke liye istemaal hone vaali ek anya pranali ko daayin taraf darshaya gaya he; yah baarah ke gunankon main ginati karne ek maujuuda pranali kaa ek vistrut rup lagata he jiskaa istemaal aam taur par dakshin asia or anya jagahon main kiya jaataa he
 In the hexadecimal system negative numbers can be expressed in the same way as the decimal system: –2A to represent –42 and so on
 haalanki, iske bajaay kuch log procesar main istemaal kiye jane vaale sateek bit pattern ko vyakt karnaa pasand karte hai or hexadesimal maanon ko sanketit maanon ke rup main hi sabase acchhee tarah sanbhale jane kaa vichaar rakhte hai
 In this way, the negative number -42 can be written as xxrep 4 f FFD6 in a 32-bit CPU register as C228 xxrep 4 0 in a 32-bit FPU register, or C045 xxrep 4 0 xxrep 4 0 in a 64-bit FPU register
 Can be written as xxrep 4 0 
 adhikansh computer binary data main pher-badal karte hai, lekin ek apekshaakrit choti binary sankhya ke liye bhi anginat ankon ke saath kaam karnaa insaanon ke liye mushkil he
 Although most humans are familiar with the base 10 system, it is quite easy to map a binary in hexadecimal compared to a decimal
 is udhaaharan xxrep 4 1 2 ko aadharank das main roopantarit kar detaa he
 Since each space of a binary number can have either 1 or 0, its value can be easily determined by its position from the right: isliye: With surprisingly little practice, it becomes easy to map xxrep 4 1 2 to F16 in one step: see table of performance of hexadecimal
 The benefit of using hexadecimal instead of decimal leads to a rapid increase in the size of the number
 jab sankhya bahut badi ho jaati he, to ise dashamalav main roopantarit karnaa bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 However, when mapping hexadecimal, it becomes negligible to recognize binary strings as 4-digit groups and map each to a single hexadecimal digit
 yah udhaaharan dashamalav main ek binary sankhya ke roopantaran ko dikhaata he, prayek ank ko dashamalav maan main map karata he or parinaamon ko jodta he
 Compare this to the conversion done in hexadecimal, where each four-digit group can be freely considered and directly converted: hexadesimal se binary main kiya jane vaala roopantaran bhi utana hi pratyaksh hota he
 The octal system can also be used as an instrument for people directly encountering binary computer data
 octal data ko chaar ke bajaay teen bits prati kairactor ke rup main darshata he
 As with all bases, the source base has a simple algorithm for modifying the display of a number in hexadecimal by dividing it into integers and performing the remaining operations
 saidhantik rup se yah kisi bhi aadharank se sambhav he lekin adhikansh insaanon ke liye keval dashamalav or adhikansh computaron ke liye keval binary ko is tareeke se badi aasaani se sambhala ja saktaa he
 Let us assume b to be the number displayed in hexadecimal and hihi-1

 In Microsoft Windows, the calculator utility can be set to scientific calculator mode, which allows conversion between radix 16, 10, 8 and 2; Basis most commonly used by programmers
 In scientific mode, the on-screen numeric keypad contains hexadecimal digits from a to f that become active when "hex" is selected
 hex mod main, tathaapi, windos calculator keval purnankon kaa samarthan karata he
 As with other numerical systems, the hexadecimal system can be used to represent rational numbers, although recurring digits are common because sixteen has only a single prime factor: jahaan ek overline ek aavarti paddati ko suchit karata he
 For any base, 0
1 is always equal to that divided by the performance of that base value in its own number system: the count of base 3 is 0, 1, 2, 10

 This makes hexadecimal less convenient than decimals for displaying rational numbers because a much larger portion remains outside the range of finite display
 hexadesimal main parimit taur par pradarshneey sabhi tarksangat sankhyaayein, dashamalav, duodesimal or sexajesimal main bhi parimit taur par pradarshneey hoti hai: arthath, ankon kii ek parimit sankhya ke saath koi bhi hexadesimal sankhya main ankon kii ek parimit sankhya hoti he jab inhen un anya mulaankon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, a multiplication clause that is finitely visible only in the latter evaluations is finitely representable in hexadecimal

 MODIS dwaara parikrama karte terra dwaara liya gaya chitra Caspian Sea Coast, Turkmenistan caspian sagar tat, bandar anjali, iran Lassi Te Cha is a famous Punjabi language satire poem composed by Anwar Masood which is popular in both Indian and Pakistani Punjab
 is kavita main uttar bharat or pakistan ke donon lokapriy peya, lassi or chaay kaa ek kaalpanik vivaad vyangypurna andaaz main darshaya he
 At the beginning of the poem Lassi grows her own and calls tea as good - rang meraa ve makkhan varga, rup ve meraa succha,duddh-malai maan-pyoh mere, meraa darja uccha!jehda mainu ridkan baithe usde vaari javankhadke dhol madhaani vaala, mai wich bhangde paavaan!main lokkan di sehat banaavaan, tu pai sehat vigademain pai thand kalejje paavaan, tu pai seene saade! My complexion is as fair as butter and my appearance is also true, milk and cream are my parents, my rating is higher than you! i sit on the floor of the person who churns me, like a sweet drum, and i cook
 i dance round and round! i make people's health and you spoil their health, i cool people's heart and you burn their chest! yahaan lassi kah rahi he ke jab koi use ek bade bartan main madhaani ke saath manthan karata he to vah us par vaari jaati he - yani uske chhinte kushi se ud-ud kar manthane vaale par padate hai
 The tea answers angrily and compares itself to Laila, who was black in color but considered very beautiful and whose Majnu was crazy
 vah lassi ko taana bhi maarthi he ki lassi to kisi bhi bartan main padi rahati he jabaki chaay hameshaa sundar bartanon main adab ke saath mez par rakhi jaati he - Mera hussan puchne jehde, heart me onaad thagamemera rang kalikkhan agit laila vargi lagangankajji rao tu kuzje in meraa husn pahchaanane vaale mere kaayal hote hanrang meraa kaala he or main laila kaa rup rakhti humpane ghade-bartan main chuphi rah, tuje kyon jalan hoti haijab mai sundar mezon par tasharif rakhti hoon? The two of you keep going for a long time and then Lassi says why not call the milk and get it decided - main kii jaanan teriyaan badakaan, main kii jaanan tainududdh kare insaaf te e manzur i bibi mainu i am neither familiar with any of your qualities nor do you agree if milk decides our fight
 parantu jab doodh aata he to wo asamanjas main pad jaataa he, kyonki donon lassi or chaay main doodh dalata he or wo donon ko hi apni betiyaan maanata he
 Milk curses himself that if he was a good parent himself, then his children would not be fighting among themselves and refused to decide - kinnu ajj ciyaani aakkhaan, kinnu aakkhaan jalli?dovaan paase rishta meraa, mainu khichch dovallisaggi jhi matarai hundi, change hon je maan-pamera vot i dovaan valle, nipat lao tusi aape Whom should i say today and whom should i call a fool today? i have a relationship with both of them, which draws me on both sides, if the parents are good, then the children have close and deep friendship with each other
 My vote goes to both of you
 Settle in bahes phir jari ho jaati he
 In the end, Lassi tells tea in two words that this country belongs to Lassi and she is the queen here, while Chai is a foreigner and just as Pardesi was expelled from the British, one day chased tea too
 will be given - meri choudhar chaar-chapere, teri mannata thodimain desaan di soobe-rani, tu paradesan chhorides paraaye rani khan di tu saali ban baithi?mangan ai agg te appu gharwaali ban baithi?rab kare ni ikko vaari ghut bhare koi teratera ve angrejan wango bathea jaae deraa My Chaudhary is all around, your belief is far less than i am the queen of this country, you are a little foreigner, you came to this foreign country and started telling yourself the sister-in-law of this house? You entered the house on the pretext of asking for fire, now Started calling herself a householder? May God bless you with a firm settlement, like the British, you should be thrown out of this country athipothala bharat desh ke andhra pradesh rajya ke guntur gilemein krishna nadi kii sahaayak nadi chandravanka nadi par sthit ek jalprapaat he
 The Chandravanka River is a combination of three streams such as Chandravanka waterfall, Nakala waterfall and Tumala waterfall

 Hurricane Fanapi, also known as Hurricane Inde in the Philippines, was a very damaging storm
 yah taiwan or dakshinpurv china main sitambar 2010 main aayaa tha
 It was the eleventh tropical storm of that year and the fourth storm of that season
 yah philippines main 14 sitambar ko bananaa shuru hua or uske baad dhire dhire kai dinon main yah aage badhane laga
 When it started moving from northeast to north, its speed was 175 kilometers per hour
 iske kaaran pehali baar thal main barish 19 sitambar ko taiwan ke huylen shahar main hua tha
 It was the first storm since August 2009 to hit the island
 iske baad ant main yah china ke fujjan shahar main barish karwaane ke baad 21 sitambar ko dakshin china main samaapt ho gaya
 The first impact was in South Japan before its influence in Taiwan and China
 jiske kaaran miako dweep main varsha bhi hui
 But it was much lower than China and Taiwan
 fanopi ke kaaran taiwan main bahut adhik barish hui or yah 1,126 millimetre ko paar kar gaya
 1,50,000 people were evicted from their homes
 pichley saal tufaan moracot ke vinaashkari prabhaav ko dekhne ke baad is saal usase kai acchhee tarah taiyaari kiya gaya tha
 Nevertheless, heavy rains led to landslides, excessive crop losses and flooding in many places
 iskaa sabase adhik prabhaav kohsiyung shahar main padaa tha
 Where 506 millimeters of rain was recorded
 iske kaaran lagbhag sau karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua tha
 a total of five people died in Taiwan at the time of the storm and the loss was around 500 million
 iske baad dakshin china main kareeb 2,64,000 logon ko unke gharon se surakshit hataaya gaya
 The storm caused a lot of rain in this place
 guyangdong main yah 640 millimetre tak pahunch gaya
 Landslides also occurred due to Funapi, due to which 75 people died
 yahan is tufaan ke kaaran solah hajaar ghar tabah ho gaye or dedh lakh acre fasal bhi puri tarah nasht ho gaya
 There was a loss of about fifty crores in this province
 iske bahut adhik nuksaan karne ke baad is naam ko mukt kar diya gaya
 Linguistics is that branch of language study in which scientific and analytical study of the origin, nature, development, etc
 of the language is done
 bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayeta 'bhashavigyaani' kehalaate hai
 Linguistics is different from grammar
 vyakaran main kisi bhashaa kaa kaaryaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he jabaki bhashavigyaani iske aage jaakar bhashaa kaa atyant vyapak adhyayan karata he
 Among the many subjects of study, linguistics is being given special importance nowadays
 bhashaa-sambandhi is adhyayan ko europe main aaj tak anek naamon or sangyaaon se abhihit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Firstly this study was added a word as an adjective next to the word Philology - then it was called as "comparative Philology"
 unnisvin shatabdi tak vyakaran tathaa bhashaa-vishyak adhyayan ko praayah ek hi samajha jaataa tha
 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'
 france main isko langistik naam diya gaya
 The name "linguistique" or "linguistics" has been prevalent in the whole of Europe in the nineteenth century due to the greater language related work in France
 iske atirikt 'science of language', ‘glautoleji’ aadi anya naam bhi is vishay ko prakat karne ke liye kaam main aaye
 Of all these names, "linguistics", "philology" are used only today
 bharatvarsh main in sabhi europea naamon ke atirikt hindi bhashaa main jo naam prayog main laae jate hai ve is prakaar hai- ‘‘bhashaa-shaastra’’, ‘‘bhashaa-tatva’’, ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’, tathaa ‘‘tulanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan’’ aadi
 Among all these names, the most common name is "linguistics"
 in naam main pracheen or naveen sabhi naamon kaa samaahaar-sa hua jaan padataa he
 Therefore, this name seems to be suitable for this scripture
 apane vartmaan swaroop main bhashaa vigyaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke mastishk kii dein kaha jaataa he
 The trend of language-related studies is found in Sanskrit literature since very ancient times
 ‘shiksha’ naamak vedang main bhashaa sambandhi sookshm charchaa uplabdh hoti he
 Detailed description of the pronunciation of the sounds - elements, location, effort etc
 is available in these texts
 ‘praatishakhya’ evam nirukt main shabdon kii vyutpatti, dhaatu, upsarg-pratyay aadi vishyon par vaigyanik vishleshan bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kaha ja saktaa he
 Under Bhartrihari's book 'sentence Pad', subtle, deep and comprehensive thinking of the form of 'word' is available
 vahaan shabd ko ‘brahm’ ke rup main pariklpit kiya gaya he or uski ‘akshar’ sangya bataai gai he
 It is, by default, a language-related book
 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‘shabd’ ’arth’, ‘ras’ ‘bhav’ ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai’ sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‘‘bhashaa’’ tathaa ‘‘vigyaan’’
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‘bhashaa’ shabd sanskrit kii ‘‘bhash’’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‘vigyaan’ shabd main ‘vi’ upsarg tathaa ‘gya’ dhaatu se ‘lut’ pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakavi Dandi has written in his great book 'kavyadarsha' informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‘avyakt vaak’ kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‘vyakt vaak’ nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‘vyakt vaak’ kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‘vyakt vaak’ kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‘yadrichhik’ sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1
 apni chir-parichit bhashaa ke vishay main jigyaasa kii tripti yaa shankaaon kaa nirmulan
 2
 Introduction to historical and prehistoric culture
 3
 kisi jati yaa sampoorn maanavtaa ke maansik vikaas kaa parichay
 4
 Solution of many problems related to the meaning, pronunciation and use of ancient literature
 5
 vishwa ke liye ek bhashaa kaa vikaas
 6
 Assistance in learning foreign languages
 7
 anuwaad karne vaali tathaa swayan tip karne vaali evam isi prakaar kii mashiinon ke vikaas or nirmaan main sahaayta
 8
 Assistance in change in terms of simplicity, correctness etc
 in language, script etc
 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that is found as a divine gift to humans
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When the subjects of linguistics were included under the syllabus of large classes, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that the values that remain for art in a period, new changes are present in the future and they should be accepted in other countries also, it is not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 One of the great features of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been done for the classical subjects like sociology, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be called as inappropriate from any point of view
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- “jis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‘uun namah siddham’ kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‘padmavat’ ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‘somalata’ shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs — buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
 katyayan evam patanjali bhi isi koti main aate hai
 Among Greek scholars, Thrax, Discolus and Erodean also did notable work in this area
 panini se purna prabhavit hokar bluemfield ne san 1932 i
 main 'language' naamak apana granth prakashit karwaakar varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati dwaara do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon kii tulana kii jaati he
 It can also be called a mixed method, because the basis of both the descriptive method and the historical method is taken
 vivaran ke liye kisi ek kaal ko nishchit karnaa hota he or tulana ke liye kam-se-kam do bhashaaon kii apeksha hoti he
 Thus, comparative method can be called the sum of descriptive method and historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati kinhin do bhashaaon par lagu ho sakati he
 For example, comparison is also done in Indian languages - Bhojpuri etc
 Or comparative study of hindi-english, hindi-russian, hindi-persian is also done
 arthath isamen kshetragat seemaa nahin he
 Scholars like William Jones, France Bopp, Maxmüller, Curtius, August Schlikher, have made significant contributions to the development of comparative linguistics
 par, abtak tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan main un siddhanton kii badi kami he, jinke aadhaar par do bhinn bhashaaon kaa vargeekaran vaigyanik nahin ban sakaa
 The structural method is the sequel to the descriptive method
 america main is paddati kaa vishesh prachaar ho rahaa he
 In this, mechanical devices are being given more importance, which will facilitate special translation
 jalig haris ne 'methaids in strectural lingusticks ' naamak pustak likhakar is paddati ko viksit kiya
 Linguistics, like other branches of science, has experimental aspects, which require systems of experimentation and laboratory
 bhinn-bhinn yantric prayogon ke dwaara uccharnatmak swanvigyaan, bhautik swanvigyaan or shravnatmak swanvigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is also called experimental phonology, mechanical phonology or laboratory phonology
 isamen darpan jaise saamaanya upkaran se lekar jatiltam vaidyut upkarnon kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 As a result, full cooperation of mathematicians, physicists and engineers in the field of linguistics is expected
 kritrim taalu or kritrim taalu projector kii sahaayta se vyaktivishesh ke dwaara uccharit swanon ke uccharan sthaan kii pariksha kii jaati he
 The Kayamograph is useful for determining the resonance and life of the swans to know the resonance and timelines
 laringo scope se swaryantr kii sthiti kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The endoscope is an improved form of laryngoscope
 osilograph kii tarangen swanon ke bhautik swaroop ko parde par yaa film par atyant spashtataa se ankit kar detii he
 The same work is done more successfully by spectographs or sonographs
 spectograph jo chitra prastut karata he unhen pattern plabac dwaara phir se suna ja saktaa he
 Recorded material can be heard at a slow speed with the help of speechstretcher
 inke atirikt or bhi chote bade yantra hai, jinase bhashavaigyanik adhyayan main paryaapt sahaayta lee ja rahi he
 Among French linguists, Ruio wrote a treatise about the use of phonology
 landan main pro farth ne vishesh taluyantr kaa vikaas kiya
 For the measurement of vowels, as the lines of the vowel point or the quadrilateral are set, they form the basis lines for the measurement of consonants, by which the utterances can be described exactly
 danniel jans or ida ward ne bhi angreji swanvigyaan par mahatvapurn kaary kiya he
 Armstrong, Bethel and Boyanus are the main speakers of French, German and Russian languages
 saidhantik or praayogic swanvigyaan par samaan rup se kaam karanevaale vyaktiyon main nimnlikhit mukhya hai: stateson, negus potter, green or cop, martin zeus, hefnar, maul aadi
 a new mechanical effort has started here, which is related to vocabulary, semantics and grammatical forms
 yantric anuwaad ke liye vaindyut computaron kaa upyog vaigyanik yug kii ek vishesh dein he
