 We need to do everything we can to help them contribute more easily
 Sorry for leaving this message in English, i make too many errors and it takes too long for me to write this much in Hindi
 Hello, i want to say two things here
 Typing is definitely one of the biggest blockers for contributors but i think that enough good options are available now
 On my talk page on English wikipedia, when dagizza invited me to contribute to Hindi Wikipedia, he gave me some links, some of which i like very much
 i am reposting part of his message here: i have some sites that convert online -> 
 i also have some sites where you can download a simple converter
 Eg
 Writing Teraa naam kyaa hai? becomes tera naam kya he? And secondly, i would also support Chaupal Chaupal for Village Pump
 Thank you 
 --abhishekapandeya 18:41, 2 navambar 2006 a user left a comment at mediawiki talk: Recentchangestext that international numerals are more useful for a greater number of people
 i agree, and since they're derived from Indian numerals anyway, i don't see the harm
 Our mission is to provide a useful reference work, not to preserve numerals that aren't as commonly used

 When i search for Ladakh on Google, i get 149 results
 But when i search for Ladakh on Google, i get no results at all
 What is the difference
 i believe that this is a problem with the problem
 Because when i search for free on Google i get 10,100 results
 But when i search for Azad on Google i only get 620 results
 On bhashaindia Hindi IME, it only gives the results on Google with the lowest results
 i only get more results if i go into Word, Insert-> Symbol-> Font: Mangal, double-click on h / a / b, and then

 What has happened? Please give your thoughts

 a road in the Sarawat Mountains sarvat pahaad yaa saraat pahaad, jinhen arabi main jabaal al-sarvat kehete hai, arabi prayadweep ke pashchimi tat ke baraabar chalane vaali ek parvatamala he
 It starts from the jordan-saudi Arabia border in the north, passes through Saudi Arabia and Yemen and reaches the Gulf of Aden in the south

 All believe that it starts from the Jordan border in northern Saudi Arabia and then moves south along the coast
 madina ke paas aakar yah kam hokar gaayab se ho jate hai lekin thodaa hi dakshin main tif ke paas phir shuru ho jate hai
 And in the Asir region in the south it starts catching height and some elevations reach a little less than 3,000 meters

 It is the main canal of Rajasthan
 vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida kehalaata he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vachanpaalan, qaraar athwa kaul ke nirvaah ko sampoorn vishwa main or visheshat: bharat main bada mahatv diya gaya he
 The story of Dasharatha, the son of exile and self-demise of a son for pledge in Indian history, is popular
 rajasthan kaa madhyakaalin itihaas isi ujwal parampara se otprot he
 But this commitment has a spiritual and moral value, law was not behind it, nor was there any legal recognition
 parantu dhire dhire vyavsaayik sambandhon main vachanpaalan kii or use kanoonee manyata dene kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav bhi jeevanamoolyon evam naitikta ke hraas ke saath hi samaaj ne kiya or isi kaaran naitik tathaa aadhyatmik drushti se vachanpaalan jahaan gaun hota gaya, vaidhanik manyataprapt vyavsaayik vachanon ke paalan ke mahatv ko pramukhataa praapt hoti gai
 The legal history of Rome is interesting in this regard from a commercial and legal point of view
 vahaan sanvida kaa pracheenatam swaroop tha
 In its original form, this lending was related to merchandise
 dhire dhire rin ke liye bhi iskaa prayog hone laga
 It had certain formalities without which perfection would not have been attained
 bharat main bhi naarad or brihaspati ke granthon main vastuvikray, rin, saajhedaari or abhikartrutv ke sambandhon kaa ullekh he
 But the nature of the present contract is different from that, although the link of its development can also be linked to them
 vartmaan sanvida kii visheshta uski kanoonee manyata he
 Every promise or agreement which is enforceable by law or which can be upheld by law is a contract
 pracheen kaal main is kanoonee manyata par vishesh bal nahin tha balki bal tha uski aupchaarikaataaon main se yadi koi aupchaarikta kam rah jaati thi to sanvida purna nahin hoti thi
 Although the practice of contract in its various forms was in the business relations of the society, the term "contract" was discovered much later
 sanvida shabd bahut vyapak he
 Parts of the contract itself are sale, loan, mortgage, deposit, partnership, motherhood, marriage etc
 parantu apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ne nayaa kanoonee arth grahan kar liya he
 In India, its act was made in 1872 AD and contracts are regulated by the same Indian Contract Act
 isaliye bhartiya nyaayalay ab sanvida ke maamle main isi likhit kanoon kaa anusaran karne ko baadhya hai
 For the interpretation of the law, they should study this act and find suitable meaning and purpose
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium british sanvida kanoon par aadhaarit he parantu british sanvida adhinium kii sahaayta tabhi lee ja sakati he jab yaa to bhartiya sanvida adhinium kisi prashn par maun ho athwa uski vyavastha aspasht ho or british kanoon bhartiya avasthaa or saamaajik sthiti se asangat na ho
 a contract in its present form is a legal promise or an enforceable agreement by law
 isamen do aavashyak tatv hai - Agreement and kanoon dwaara use prabhaavasheel banaae jane kaa gun
 When at least two people are unanimous in relation to doing or abstaining from something, then it is called agreement
 qaraar ke liye kam se kam do pakshon kaa hona aavashyak he
 If "A" proposed to "B" that "B" make a picture of "A", he would give "B" five hundred rupees for this work
 "a" ke dwaara yah prastaav he
 If "B" accepts that he will make a picture for "A" in five solar rupees, then it is an agreement that is enforceable by law and can be made effective
 arthath ek vyakti akelaa hi koi qaraar nahin kar saktaa he qaraar ke liye qaraar sambandhi baton par ubhay paksh kii maansik ekaatmata hona aavashyak he
 This means that in relation to everything related to the agreement, the common parties understand the same meaning
 aisa na ho ki ek paksh ek arth or doosraa paksh doosraa arth samajhe
 "A" has two motorcars, one Ford and the other Chevrolet
 vah apni ford car paanch hajaar main bechnaa chahta he
 He offered to sell that car with "B"
 parantu "ba" ne "shevarlyt" car samajhakar use kharidne kii sweekruti pradaan kar di
 This agreement will not happen because "A" and "B" did not result in mental monotony in relation to the motorcar
 motorcar se "a" ne ford motorcar or "ba" ne shevarlyt car samajhi
 It is clear from the above statement that the proposal becomes an agreement only after acceptance
 prastaav vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai parantu saadhaarant: unka vargeekaran paanch shreniyon main kiya gaya he : 1
 Specific proposal, when a proposal is made to a certain person or persons, it is called a specific proposal
 chunki prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, at: isamen sweekaar karanevaala vyakti, jise swikarta kaha jayega, nirdisht hota he
 In this, the acceptance notice must be given by the acceptor to the proposer
 2
 saamaanya prastaav vah prastaav he jo nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se nahin kiya jaataa balki sansar kaa koi vyakti ise sweekaar kar saktaa he
 That is why, like a specific proposal, it is not mandatory to give the information of acceptance to the proposer
 prastaav main prakatit or icchit kaary ko karnaa hi is prastaav kii sweekruti maani gai he
 3
 Explicit proposals are those proposals which are made in verbal or written form but clearly
 4
 sankethik prastaav ye prastaav shabdon dwaara na hokar kaary dwaara kiye jate hai
 There is a proposal to take passengers from one place to another in lieu of tickets, the train has to come to the station
 yah saamaanya prastaav kaa bhi udaarahan he kyonki iskaa swikarta purvanishchit nahin he
 5
 Continuous proposal In this proposal, a proposal to supply 5000 mana of wheat at a fixed rate
 is prastaav kii sweekruti ke uparant bhi ek paksh turant hi sampoorn gehun kharidne ko yaa doosraa paksh bechney ko baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Like the proposal and according to it determines a particular method or system of acceptance, there determines that method or system of acceptance, if there is no acceptance by that method or system of acceptance, then the proposer is forced to accept by that system Should give
 parantu jahaan sweekruti kii kisi pranali yaa vishisht vidhi kaa ullekh nahin ho, vahaan kisi yuktiyukt, sangat or uchit pranali dwaara sweekruti di ja sakati he
 Acceptance can also be explicitly by words or by act in symbolic form
 tikat lekar gantavy sthaan ko janevaali railgadee par yatri kaa baithna hi kaary dwaara company ke prastaav kii sweekruti he
 Mental acceptance alone cannot be considered acceptance
 shabdon main athwa kaary dwaara uski abhivyakti bhi aavashyak he
 Performing the tasks specified in the proposal is also considered acceptance of certain proposals
 parantu yah aavashyak he ki swikarta is kaary ko karne ke purv se hi prastaavak kii sharte jaanata ho
 If the acceptor performs the work specified in the offer without the knowledge of the offer, it cannot be considered acceptance of the offer
 ek vyakti goridutt ne apane bhattije kii khoj ke liye apane munim lalman ko bheja
 After Lalman's departure, Gauridutt announced a 501 rupee award for his nephew
 lalman munim gauridatt ke bhattije ko khoj laayaa or puraskaar kii maang kii
 The decision was made that since Lalman was not informed of the condition of the award before the search of the boy, nor was it known to receive the award, Lalman's task of finding the lost boy could not be considered acceptance of Gauridutt's proposal
 prastaav se utpann laabh ko sweekaar karnaa bhi upyukt dashaon main prastaav kii sweekruti samajhi jaati he
 Sitting in a bus from Varanasi to Prayag is acceptance of the offer of the bus owner and the acceptor is obliged to pay the bus fare
 sweekruti prastaav ke kaayam rahane kii dasha main honi chahie
 If the proposal has been nullified or has been rejected or withdrawn by the proposer, acceptance will also be null and void
 prastaavak kii soochna swikarta ko or prastaav kii sweekruti kii soochna prastaavak ko milanaa aavashyak he
 When the information of the proposal is received by the person to whom the proposal is made, then the convection or communication of the proposal is deemed complete
 "k" ne apni ghadi 150) main "kha" ko bechney kaa prastaav patr dwaara "kha" kii preshit kiya
 As soon as the letter "B" is received, the offer for "A" will be completed
 sweekrurta ke liye pruthak pruthak hota he
 When the acceptor sends his acceptance to the proposer in such a way that his withdrawal is not in the hands of the acceptor, the acceptance against the proposer reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa sanvahan purna samajha jayega parantu swikarta ke viruddh nahin
 Convection of acceptance against acceptance against the acceptor will be complete when the acceptance reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa patr "k" ke naam daalate hi sweekruti kii pabandi "k" naamak prastaavak ke viruddh ho jaaegi parantu swikarta "kha" ke viruddh nahin
 Completion of convection against "B" will occur when "A" receives its letter of acceptance
 jab prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab donon do sthanon par hon to sanvahan kaa madhyam dak : patr yaa taar : hota he
 It is clear from the above statement that the letter of offer is not completed as soon as it is left by the proposer, but is completed only after reaching the acceptor
 isse yah bhi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab tak swikarta apni sweekruti kaa patr dak main nahin chhod detaa kyonki tab sweekruti kaa waapas liya janaa swikarta ke vash ke baahar ho jaataa he
 Every offer left by the acceptor in the mail is completed against the proposer
 upar kaha ja chukaa he ki sweekruti swikarta ke viruddh tab purna hoti he jab prastaavak ko praapt ho jaae
 Acceptors leave their acceptance letters in the post office before the proposer receives them, against the acceptor is also completed
 sweekrutapatr der main pahunchne yaa raste main kho jane par bhi prabhavakaari rahata he kyonki aisa mana gaya he ki dak vibhaag kii asaavadhaanee yaa bhul kaa koi prabhaav sanvida ke pakshon par padana nyaaysangat nahin he
 But if the letter for convection is not given in the post to the postman, then it is not enough convection because it is not included in the duties of the postman to leave every person's letter in the post
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium 1872 i
 kii dhara 10 ke anusaar aise sabhi qaraar sanvida maane gaye hai jo Negotiable parties swatantra sahmati se kiye jaae, Whose returns and objectives are valid and ukt adhinium dwaara nisatva na ghoshit kiye gaye hon
 It has also been clarified in this section that the above definition will not affect any such law, jiske dwaara kisi sanvida kaa likhit, yaa panjikrut sakshiyon kii gavaahi ke saath hona aavashyak he
 All such persons are considered to be contractual, who are adult, healthy minded and are not disqualified by any law
 falswaroop Minor, vikrut mastishkvaale vyakti yaa unmatta, jadbuddhi tathaa nashe main chur rahanevaale, And such persons, who are disqualified to contract by law, such as foreign enemies, foreign emperors or their representatives, enemies of the country, criminals etc
, cannot contract
 avasyak vyakti swatantra buddhi se apane laabh haani kaa nirnay nahin kar saktaa
 Hence, he is not considered as contractable
 vikrut mastik vaale vyaktiyon main agar vikruti asthaayee ho hri yani kabhi mastishk vaale vyaktiyon main agar vikruti asthaayee ho hri yani kabhi mastishk vikrut or kabhi swasth rahata ho hri to aise vyakti vikrutikaal main to nahin parantu mastishk kii swasthata ke kaal main sanvida kaa yogya paksh ho sakate hai1 apradhi kaa dandbhog ke samay sanvida karne kaa adhikaar nilambit ho jaataa he parantu dandbhog yaa kshamaprapti ke pashchaat use sanvida karne kii kshamta pun: praapt ho jaati he
 a person declared insolvent is also deprived of the ability to contract
 sanvida ke pakshon kii sahmati kaa swatantra hona sanvida kii ek pramukh aavashyaktaa he
 If the consent is not independent then the contract will be affected by it
 sahmati us dasha main swatantra maani jaati he jab yah 1
 Force or tragedy, 2
 avaanchit prabhaav, 3
 Treachery, 4
 bhrant kathan, yaa bhranti dwaara prabhavit nahin hui ho or na praapt kii gai ho
 The definition of force or tragedy is given in the Indian Contract Act
 uske anusaar balpravartan yaa traas ke chaar rup he : Performing acts punishable and punishable by the Indian Penal Law or karne kii dhamkee dena, chaahe us sthaan par jahaan yah kaary kiya jaae bhartiya dand vidhaan lagu ho yaa nahin, Unlawfully withholding the property of any person; Or roak rakhane kii dhamkee dena
 The purpose of this force or tragedy should be to make someone a party to the contract
 avaanchit prabhaav kii paribhaasha sanvida adhinium kii dhara 16 main di gai he
 According to him, the contract is said to be motivated by undue influence whose relations of the parties are such that one party uses that particular position with the will of the other party
 mata pita or bachche, abhibhavak or palya, vakil ore muvakkil, doctor or rogi, guru or shishy aadi ke sambandh aise hi hote hai jinamein pratham paksh duusare kii ichchhaaon ko apane vishisht sambandh ke kaaran prerit karata he
 In order to prove undue influence, it is also necessary to prove that in fact, on the other side of the party of special status, used its special position for its unfair advantage
 yadi yah baat siddh nahin hoti to keval vishisht sthiti ke hi kaaran koi sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prabhavit yaa parityajya nahin samajhi jaaegi
 This is described in Section 17 of the Contract Act
 uske anusaar sanvida ke kisi paksh dwaara yaa uski sajeesh se yaa uske abhikarta dwaara duusare paksh yaa uske abhikarta ko dhokhaa dene yaa chhalane yaa sanvida se sammilit hone ke liye prerit karne ke hetu nimnaankit kaary chhalkapat kehalaayenge : A) to tell the facts, which he does not believe in the truth, kha) aise tathy ko chhipaana jiskaa use gyaan yaa vishwaas na ho; C) to give a promise that does not wish to be fulfilled; gha) aisa kaary karnaa yaa usase virat hona jise kanoon vishesh rup se chhalkapat ghoshit karata ho; 4) To do other deceptive tasks
 qaraar ke sambandh main vichaar karte hue yah kaha gaya he ki ubhay paksh ke bich maansik mataiky kaa hona aavashyak he
 The fallacy is related to this
 isamen ek paksh ek vastu yaa baat or doosraa paksh duusari vastu yaa baat samajhataa he
 As a result, the contract seems to be seen in the upper way, but there is virtually no contract due to confusion
 ye bhrantiyaan kai prakaar kii hotin hai
 An example of confusion regarding content is given by Chevrolet and Ford Motor Cars in the pre-section
 isi prakaar sanvida ke paksh kii pahchaan main bhi bhranti sambhav he
 "A" contracted as "B", if it was in fact "B" and not "C", then it is a misconception of the identity of the party
 sanvida kii prakruti yaa arth sambandhi bhi bhranti ho sakati he
 If one of the later parties signs an agreement on the other party stating the application for taking the opportunity later, then the other party gets confused about the form or nature of the contract
 aisi dasha main hastakshar banaanevaale kaa mastishk uske hastakshar ke saath nahin he
 Yield is an essential element for covenant
 bina pratifal ke koi prasanvida nahin ho sakati; or yadi vah ho bhi to ni:satv yaa avaidh hoti he
 The return must also be valid
 udhaaharan swaroop "a", "ba" ko "sa" kii hatya ke liye 5000 ru
 detaa he or "ba" hatya ke liye vachan detaa he
 Here this contract is free because its reward is forbidden by murder law
 is prakaar nimnlikhit prakaar ke pratifal avaidh hote hai - 1
 The returns which are forbidden by law
 yadi koi pratifal spashtyaa yaa sankethik rup se kanoon dwaara varjit ho to uske aadhaar par nirmit prasanvida ni:satya hoti he
 This will become clear from the above example
 2
 yadi koi aisa pratifal ho jisase kisi adhinium kii koi vyavastha bhang hoti ho yaa nishphal hoti ho to vah pratifal avaidh mana jayega
 3
 Those returns which are fraudulent are considered illegal
 4
 vah pratifal jiske dwaara kisi vyakti ke sharir yaa sampatti ko haani pahunchati ho avaidh hota he
 For example, a promises to pay five hundred rupees to the editor of a newspaper if the offending details about Editor b are printed
 yahan pratifal avaidh he kyonki isse ba kii pratishtha par aghat pahunchataa he
 5
 Returns that are immoral are illegal
 6
 lokaneeti ke viruddh pratifal avaidh hote hai, jaise shatru ke saath vyapaar karnaa
 Contracts tending to cause harm to public service, contracts strangling lawsuits related to punishable offenses are disqualified
 vaidhanik karrwai kaa durupyog karne kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, aisi sanvida jau naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi jo naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi vyavask vyakti ko shaadi karne se rokane ke liye sanvida, ityadi bhi lokaneeti ke viruddh evam ni:satv hotin hai
 The invalidation of even one of the aims and rewards makes the contract null
 yadi sanvida kaa uddeshy anshat: avaidh ho tab bhi sanvida ni:satv ho jaati he, yadi uske avaidh ansh ko vaid ansh se pruthak na kiya ja sake
 If the illegal share of the consideration or purpose can be separated from the valid portion, then the valid portion will be enforceable and the invalid share will be disqualified
 jaise "ba" ne "a" ko ek pratigyapaatr dwaara 2000 rupye dene kaa vachan diya jinamein se 1500 rupye purana rin tha or 500 rupye jue main haari rakam thi
 In this, the legitimate part can be separated from the illegal part; Therefore, this covenant will be valid for 1500 rupees, but 500) will be disqualified
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium ke antargat ni:satv ghoshit qaraar kanoon dwaara pravartaneey nahin ho sakate, yadhyapi usamen sanvida ke anya tatv purnat: vidyaman bhi hon
 The following agreements fall into this category: 1) truti yaa bhranti dwaara prabhavit qaraar; 2
 Agreement entered into with the minor; 3
 pratifalviheen qaraar; 4
 Contract Agreement Preventing Adult Marriage; 5
 vyaparnirodhak qaraar; 6

 anishchit qaraar; 8
 Agreement to do impossible things; 9
 pan vishyak qaraar; 10
 Possible agreement on the occurrence of unlikely events; 11
 avaidh pratifal yaa uddeshyvaale qaraar
 It is not necessary for all agreements and contracts to be written, registered and with the testimony of witnesses, but such a contract, despite all other properties, is not valid due to lack of these formalities
 uparyukt varnan se sanvida-nirmaan ke aavashyak tatwon kaa saar nimnlikhit prathit hota he : 1
 having at least two sides; 2

 Qualification of common sides; 6

 Matsyavatar Matsyavatar is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu who is one of his ten incarnations
 vishnu ko paalankarta kaha jaataa he at: vah brahmad kii raksha hetu vividh avatar dharte hai
 Lord Vishnu incarnates when there is some kind of danger to the world
 bramhand kii aavadhik vighatan ke pralay ke thik pehle jab prajapati brahma ke munh se vedon kaa gyaan nikal gaya, tab asur haygreev ne us gyaan ko churaakar nigal liya
 Then Lord Vishnu incarnated as Matsya, his primary incarnation and made himself a small, helpless fish in front of King Satyavrat Manu
 subah satyavrath suryadev ko arghya de rahe the tabhi ek machhlee nen unase kaha ki aap mujhe apane kamandal main rakh lo
 According to mercy and religion, this king took the fish in his kamandala and went towards the house, till the house reached the fish the size of that kamandala, the king placed it on a vessel but after some time, that fish came out of that vessel
 Shaped
 ant main raja nen use samudr main daalaa to usne puure samudr ko dhank liya
 The golden-colored fish revealed his divine identity and informed his devotee that on the seventh day of that day, the Holocaust will come, after that the world will have a new creation, they will gather all the herbs, seeds and animals, Sapta Rishi etc
 to Satyavrat
 He asked to be stored in the boat sent by God
 phir yah ati-vishaal machhlee haygreev ko markar vedo ko gumnaam hone se bachaaya or use brahma ko de diya
 When Brahma wakes up from his sleep which was at the end of the temple, it is called the night of Brahma, which lasts for 4 320 000 000 years on the basis of calculation
 jab jowar bramhand ko bhasma karne laga tab ek vishaal naav aayaa, jis par sabhi chadhe

 udhyam sansaadhan yojana ek company-vyapee computer software pranali he jiskaa upyog saajha data bhandaron dwaara sabhi sansadhano, soochna or vyapaar sambandhi prakaaryon ke samanvay or prabandhan hetu hota he
 An ERP system has a service-oriented architecture consisting of modular hardware and software units and "services" that communicate over a local area network
 yah anukhandit dizin ek vyapaar ko data akhandta ko banaaye rakhte hue anukhandon ko jodne yaa parivartit karne kii anumati pradaan karata he, ek saajha databes main jo centrestha athwa vitarit saktaa he
 ] ERP adyakshar kii utpatti MRP or CIM ke vistaar ke rup main hui thi
 It was introduced in 1990 by research and analysis firm Gartner
 ERP pranaliyaan ab udhyam ke sabhi pramukh kaaryon ko samahit karne kaa prayaas karti hai, sanghathan kaa vyavsaay yaa ghoshnaptr chaahe kuch bhi ho
 These systems can now be found in non-production businesses, non-profit organizations, and governments
 ERP pranali kahalaane ke liye, ek software package ko kam se kam do pranaaliyon ke prakaarya pradaan karne chahie
 For example, a software package that provides both salary and accounting functions may technically be called an ERP software package
 ek ERP main anukhandon ke udaahranon main, jo pehle swatantra aplicoshan hua karte the, shaamil hai: utpaada jivan-chakra prabandhan, aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan, godaam prabandhan, graahak sambandh prabandhan, bikri aadesh prasanskaran, online bikri, vittiya, maanav sansaadhan or nirnay samarthan pranali
 Some organizations — typically those with sufficient internal IT capabilities to integrate software products — choose to implement only parts of an ERP system and develop external interfaces to ERP or independent systems for their other application requirements
 Huh
 udhaaharan ke liye, ve kisi ek vikreta kii maanav sansaadhan prabandhan pranali kaa upyog karne kaa chayan kar sakate hai or pranaaliyon ke darmyaan ekikaran ko swayan kar sakate hai
 This is common for retailers, where a medium-sized retailer will also have a discrete point of sale product and financial applications and then a range of specific applications for warehouse management, employee inventory, merchandising and logistics
 
 adarsh rup main, ERP ek ekal databes pradaan karata he jisamen software anukhandon ke liye sabhi data maujuud rahete hai, jinamein shaamil hai: Data warehousing for customers, suppliers and employees and various self-service interface access control - user privilege customization based on authority levels for process execution - to meet expansion, addition and change in process flow udhyam sansaadhan yojana shabd mul rup se manuphaccharing risource planning se liya gaya he, jo ki material riquirement planning se aayaa he
 MRP transitioned to ERP when "routings" became a major part of the software architecture, and a company's capacity planning activity also became a part of standard software activities
 ERP pranaliyaan aamtaur par company ke nirmaan, loujistics, vitaran, maal, nauvahan, chaalaan or lekha kaa prabandhan karti hai
 ERP software can assist in the control of many business activities such as sales, marketing, distribution, billing, production, goods management, quality management and human resource management
 companiyon dwaara apni puraani pranaaliyon main Y2K samasya kaa saamana karne ke kaaran 1990 ke dashak main ERP pranaaliyon kii bikri main baari vruddhi dekhne ko mili
 Many companies took advantage of this opportunity to replace their outdated information systems with ERP systems
 bikri kii is teji main 1999 main mandi aa gayi, kyonki is samay tak adhikansh companiyaan apane Y2K samaadhaan lagu kar chuki thim
 ERP is often incorrectly considered a back office system, indicating that customers and the general public have no direct concern with it
 isaki tulana front offis pranaaliyon ke saath kii jaati he, jaise ki graahak sambandh prabandhan pranaliyaan jo sidhe graahakon se judati hai, yaa i-bijness pranaliyaan jaise ki i-kamrs, i-government, i-telecom or i-finance, yaa aapurtikarta sambandh prabandhan pranaliyaan
 ERP can be used throughout the enterprise and any of its functions
 kaary-kalapon yaa utpaadan main shaamil sabhi prakaarya vibhaag ek pranali main ekikrut kar die jate hai
 Apart from manufacturing, storage, logistics and information technology, it will also include accounting, human resources, marketing and strategic management

 adhikansh ERP vikritaon ke software package main sarvshereshth pranaaliyon kaa samaayojan rahata he
 When implementing an ERP system, organizations can choose between customizing the software, or modifying their business processes to conform to the "best practices" in the software
 ERP se pehle software kaa vikaas vyapaarik prakriyaaon ke anusaar hota tha
 Due to the complexity of most ERP systems and the negative consequences of failure in ERP implementation, most vendors have incorporated "best practices" into their software
 vikreta ke anusaar ye "sarvottam prathaen" ek ekikrut udhyam-vyapee pranali main kisi vishisht vyapaarik prakriya ke liye sabase kargar tarika hoti hai
 a study by the Lugwigshafen University of Applied Science surveyed 192 companies and concluded that companies that have implemented industry best practices have declined in important project tasks such as configuration, documentation, testing and training
 iske alaava, sarvottam prathaon ke upyog se anya softwaron kii tulana main jokhim main 71% se adhik kii kami aayi
 The use of best practices makes compliance with requirements such as IFRS, sarbanes-oxley or Basel II easier
 ve vahaan bhi madad kar sakati hai jahaan prakriya electronic dhan hastantaran jaisi ek vastu ho
 This is because the process of capturing and reporting legislative and commodity content can be easily coded within ERP software and then replicated with confidence across businesses that have similar business requirements
 vyavsaayon kii sabhi kaaryaatmak ikaayiyon main aplications or prakriyaaon kii vyapak gunjaaish hoti he; ERP software pranaaliyon kaa utpaadan kiya jaataa he jo aam taur par jatil hoti hai or karmchaariyon kii kaary paddatiyon main mahatvapurn badlaavon kii maang karti hai
 The implementation of ERP software is typically too complex for "internal" skills, so it is desirable and advisable to seek the help of professionally trained external consultants to implement these systems
 This is usually the most effective way to reduce costs
 teen prakaar kii sevaayen hai jinke liye niyukti kii ja sakati he - paraamarsh, anukulan or sahaayta
 ek ERP pranali ko lagu karne kii avadhi vyapaar ke aakaar, anukhandon kii sankhya, anukulan kii seemaa, parivartan kii gunjaaish or pariyojna kaa swaamitv grahan ke liye graahak kii ichha, par nirbhar karti he
 ERP systems are modulated, so it is not necessary to implement them all at once
 These can be divided into different levels or stages
 ek aam pariyojna main lagbhag 14 maheene or 150 ke aasapaas salaahkaaron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a small project can be planned and implemented within 3-9 months; Whereas, a large, multi-sectoral and multi-country implementation may take years
 karyanvayan kii avadhi bahut kuch anukulan kii vaanchit maatra par nirbhar karti he
 Companies often seek the assistance of ERP vendors or third-party consulting companies to implement ERP systems
 ye companiyaan aamtaur par teen kshetron kii peshewar sevaayen pradaan karti hai: paraamarsh, anukulan or sahaayta
 graahak sanghathan, swatantra kaarykram prabandhan, vyapaar vishleshan, parivartan prabandhan or UAT visheshgyon ko niyukt kar sakate hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki karyanvayan ke dauraan unki vyavsaayik aavashyaktaaon kii praathamikta bani rahe
 Data transfer is one of the most important activities in determining the success of an ERP implementation
 chunki sthanantaran se pehle kai mahatvapurn nirnay liye jate hai, ati yojanabaddh tareeke se aage badhanaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Unfortunately, data migration is the last activity before the production phase of an ERP implementation, so it is given little attention due to time constraints
 ek ERP karyanvayan kii safalataa ke liye data pravaas ranneetiyon ke nimnlikhit kadam sahaayak siddh ho sakati hai: ERP vendors have designed their systems according to standard business processes, based on best business practices
 Processes of different vendors are of different types but they all follow a standard, modular nature
 parinamswaroop, jo companiyaan ERP pranaaliyon ko lagu karnaa chaahati hai unhen apni maujuuda prakriyaaon ke anusaar ERP package ko dhaalane kii bajaay apane sanghathanon ko maanak prakriyaaon ke anusaar dhaalane ke liye baadhya hona padataa he
 Neglecting to map current business processes before starting ERP implementation is one of the main reasons for the failure of ERP projects
 yah isliye mahatvapurn he ki sanghathan ek ERP vikreta ke chayan or iske kriyanvayan se pehle vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa sampoorn vishleshan karen
 This analysis should map all the existing business processes, so that an ERP vendor whose standard modules are most closely associated with the established organization is selected
 Redesign can then be implemented to achieve greater procedural integration
 shodh yah ingit karata he ki vyavsaayik prakriyaaon main bemail ke jokhim ko nimnlikhit ke dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he: ERP implementation is more difficult in organizations where there are almost independent business units, each unit being responsible for its own losses, as they each have separate processes, business rules, data semantics, authority hierarchies and decision centers
 Occur
 samaadhaanon main shaamil hai, sthaneey parivartan prabandhan peshewaron dwaara aavashyaktaaon kaa samanvay yaa, yadi yah sambhav na ho, shithil ekikrut udaahranon kaa upyog karte hue sanghabaddh karyanvayan jinhen sthaneey aavashyaktaaon kii purti hetu vishesh taur par vinyast or / yaa anukool banaaya gaya ho
 One disadvantage of ERP is commonly reported that the transformation of business processes to match standardized ERP modules can lead to a decrease in competitive superiority
 pralekhith sakshya maujuud he jahaan vastav main aisa hua, jabaki anya maamle darshaate hai ki ERP prakriyaaon kaa purnataa se anusaran sthai pratispardhaatmak shreshthata ko vastav main badha saktaa he
 Configuring an ERP system is basically just balancing between what you want the system to do and how the system allows you to work
 shuruyaat is baat se karen ki kin anukhandon ko sthapit karnaa he, tatpashchaat apni company kii prakriyaaon ke saath sarvshereshth sambhav samaayojan hetu, vinyas talikaon ke upyog se pranali ko samanvit karen
 Modules - Most systems are modulated only so that some functions can be implemented, but others are not
 vitt or lekha jaise kuch saamaanya anukhand lagbhag sabhi companiyon dwaara apanaae jate hai; jabaki maanav sansaadhan prabandhan jaise anya anukhandon kii aavashyaktaa companiyon ko nahin hoti, isliye unhen nahin apanaaya jaataa he
 For example, a service provider might not need a construction module
 Many times companies do not adopt any module because they have their own system which is better for them
 saamanytah, jitne adhik anukhandon kaa chayan kiya jaayegaa, ekikaran laabh main utani hi vruddhi hogi, lekin saath hi laagat, jokhim or sambandhit parivartanon main bhi vruddhi aayegi
 Configuration Tables - a configuration table enables a company to customize a specific aspect of the system according to the way its business is selected
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek sanghathan maal-suchi lekhankan ke prakaar kaa- fifo yaa lifo- chayan kar saktaa he, yaa vah rajasav kii pahchaan kiske dwaara karnaa chahat he- bhugolic ikai, utpaada, yaa vitaran channel
 tab kya hota he jab pranali dwaara pradipt vikalp samuchit na hon? aise main company ke paas do vikalp hai, lekin donon hi adarsh nahin hai
 That enterprise system can rewrite the codes, or continue to use the existing system and create interfaces between it and the new enterprise system
 donon vikalp karyanvayan prakriya kii laagat or samay ko badhaayenge
 iske alaava ve is pranali ke ekikaran laabh ke mahatv ko bhi kam kar sakate hai
 The greater the amount of system optimization, the lower the ease of communication between suppliers and customers
 kai sanghathanon ke paas ERP pariyojna ko lagu karne ke liye paryaapt aantarik kaushal nahin tha
 As a result, many organizations started providing consulting services for ERP implementation
 aamtaur par, ek paraamarsh team puure ERP karyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar thi, jisamen shaamil tha yojana, prashikshan, pareekshan, karyanvayan or anukulit anukhandon kii delivery
 anukulan ke udaahranon main shaamil hai, atirikt utpaada prashikshan; prakriya pravartak or karypravah kaa nirmaan; ERP kaa vyapaar main kis prakaar upyog kiya jaye, isamen sudhaar hetu visheshgy salaah; pranali anukulan; or sahaayta lekhan reportein, jatil data nishkarshon yaa vyapaar khufia karyanvayan
 Implementation costs for most mid-sized companies can range from twice the written price of an ERP user license
 Larger companies, especially multi-sectoral or multi-country companies, often spend significantly more than the cost of user licenses for implementation — spending up to three to five times is not uncommon for multi-sectoral implementations
 adhikansh ekal-uddeshy aplications ke vipareet, ERP packages main shuruyaat se hi purna strot code shaamil rahaa he or anurupan tathaa pradipt code ke vistaar ke liye vikreta samarthit team ides ke saath inako bheja jaataa rahaa he
 During the early years of ERP, when a potential client was considering internally developing its own unique solution, or gathering function-wide solutions by integrating multiple applications of the "best-of-breed", At the time, support for mature equipment guarantees and extensive customization was an important sales rationale
 packing ke dibbe se baahar nikalate hi kor pranali kaise kaam karti he, graahakon dwaara usko parvartit karne kii aavashyaktaa kii purti hetu ERP vikritaon ne pehle se hi maujuud "vinyas" suvidhaayen pradaan karke anurupan kii aavashyaktaaon ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The main differences between customization and configuration include: is vishleshan ke anusaar, ek ERP package kaa anurupan apratyaashit rup se mahangaa or jatil ho saktaa he, tathaa ek ekikaran pranali ke spasht laabhon kii prapti main deree kar saktaa he
 However, simulating an ERP suite provides scope for applying secret technologies to excellence in specific areas, as well as ensuring that industry best practices are implemented in less sensitive areas
 is sandarbh main "vistaar" un tareekon ko darshata he jinke dwaara pradipt ERP vaataavaran ko tritiy-paksh kaaryakramon dwaara badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 It is technically easier to open most ERP exchanges to external programs, for example, xxrep 4 
 chunki ERP aplications main aamtaur par jatil niyam shaamil hote hai jo master data ke nirmaan or parivartan ko niyantrit karte hai, kuch paridrishyon kaa karyanvayan bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 Maintenance and ancillary services include, monitoring and managing an operational ERP system
 This function is usually provided internally with the help of members of the IT department, or may also be provided by an external specialist consulting and services company
 ek ERP pranali kii anupasthiti main, ek bade nirmaataa ke paas kai software aplications ho sakate hai jo ek duusare se prabhavi rup se samvaad yaa interphes sthapit karne main asamarth hon
 ek duusare ke saath interphes sthapit karne vaale kaaryon main shaamil hai: The ERP system centers the data in one place
 iske laabhon main shaamil hai: Some security features are incorporated into an ERP system to provide protection against external crime such as industrial espionage and internal crime such as embezzlement
 udhaaharan ke liye data se ched-chhaad kaa ek paridrishy yah ho saktaa he, ek asantusht karmchaaree jaanboojhkar keemton ko unke nimnatam str ke neeche rakh rahaa ho taaki company ke munaafe se ched-chhaad kii ja sake yaa anya kisi prakaar se nuksaan pahunchaaya ja sake
 ERP systems generally facilitate internal control against such acts
 ERP vikreta anya prakaar ke soochna suraksha upkarnon ke saath behatar ekikaran kii ore bad rahe hai
 The problems with ERP systems are primarily due to insufficient investment in the training of the IT personnel involved - including those who implement and test the changes - as well as the lack of corporate policy towards protecting data integrity and how they are used

 Antarctica is the only continent of the earth where no humans originally lived, and this treaty system determines all international relations regarding Antarctica

 Under this treaty, Antarctica was declared a scientifically protected area and any military action was banned on this continent
 saath hi antarctic ke maamalon par nirnay karne ke liye ek vaarshik "antarctic sandhi paraamarsh baithak" kii parampara shuru kii gai
 When the treaty was first signed, the seven countries claimed their sovereignty over the different regions of Antarctica, that is, those regions were described as part of their countries
 sandhi ne yah kaha ki koi bhi hastakshar karne vaala na to apane daawey se hat rahaa he, na kisi or kaa daawa maan rahaa he or na hi koi nayaa daawa karegaa
 For example, France considers the region called Adeli Earth of Antarctica as part of it, but under the treaty it is unable to convince this claim from anyone else

 In 1942, Vasily Zetsev, a shepherd in the Ural hills, is now a much-needed and pioneer soldier of the 'red Army'
 use german fouj ke khilaaf ek aatmghaatee hamale ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Vasili is a surefire shooter
 vah apane prabhaavshaalee nishanebaazi se swayan or kaamisar danilov ko jarman sainikon se bachaata he
 Nikita Krushev arrives at Stalingrad for a military combination
 vah afasaron se sainikon kaa manobal badhaane ke liye tark dene k anurodh karte hai
 Danilov, now a senior lieutenant, suggests finding a model for soldiers and countrymen
 iske liye vah vaisili kii bahaduri ke kisse sena ke samachar patr main chhapata he
 Soon Vasily gets the status of a nation-hero
 anya sainik or deshvasi yuddh main agrasar hone kii prerana lete hai or usak protsaahan bhi karte hai
 Vasili now gets employed in the army's sniper department
 saath hi saath, danilov or vaisili achche dost ban jate hai
 Tania is an undercover civilian
 danilov or vaisili, donon hi tania ko chaahate hai
 Danilov gets Tania transferred to the Intelligence Department
 vaisili din par din kai german afasaron ko maar giraata he
 For this reason, the German army calls its best and distinguished sniper Major Irwin König to Stalingrad
 major ervin konig ko vaisili ko maarane kaa kaam saunpa jaataa he, jisase ki soviet sena kaa manobal tut jaae or ve stallingrad kii ladai haar jaayen
 Major König is the president of the sniper school, Joussen
 major konig apane tazurbe kaa istamaal kar ke vaisili or uske saathiyon ko apane chaal main fasaa lete hai, jab tak ki vaisili yah chaal samajhataa he tab tak uske do saathi maare jate hai
 The Red Army now learns about Major König and his mission

 Major König, however, forces Kulikov to reveal his position with his bets

 During this, Major König shoots and shoots Kulikov's head, but Vasily survives

 Here Krushev insists on Danilov to end the ongoing duel between Vasily and König
 tania sniper vibhaag main waapas jane ke liye apni arzi daakhil karti he
 Knowing this, Danilov pleads with Vassili to convince Tania not to come
 vaisili koshish karata he, par taniya use bataati he ki kaise german sena ne uske yahudee mata-pita ko maaraa tha
 Upon hearing this, Vassili becomes emotional and is unable to stop Tania from coming

 vah use vaisili ke bare main konig ko galat soochna dene kaa kaary saunpta he, taaki vaisili konig ko aasaani se maar de
 For the first time Vassili succeeds in killing König, but the second time he falls asleep in the battlefield while waiting for König due to exhaustion
 is dauraan, ek german sainik, jo ki shahid sainikon kaa keemtee saamaan lut rahaa tha, vaisili kii sniper log-book uthaa le jaataa he
 The German command treats this log as proof of Vassili's death and arranges for König to be sent to Germany, but König knows that Vassily is still alive
 is baar sasha par shaq karte hue, konig sasha ko apane agle gupt sthal kii jaankaree jaan-bujhakar detaa he
 During this time, Tania and Vasilei confess their love to each other
 yah jaanakar danilov andar hi andar vaisili se jalataa he or apane afasaron ko likhe ek patr main uski upeksha karata he
 König sees Vassilie and Tania near their next secret site and is proved to be Sasha
 konig sasha ko jaan se maar kar ek pole se lataka detaa he, taki vah vaisili ko maar sake
 Seeing this, Vassilie vows to Tania that he must kill König and tells Tania to send Sasha's mother out of Stalingrad along with Danilov
 sasha kii maan ko bandargah par le jate vakt, visfot ke kaaran ude ek tej jhitake se tania buree tarah ghayal ho jaati he
 Thinking that Tania is dead, her jealousy towards Vassily turns into hatred for herself
 vah vaisili ke gupt-ghaat sthal par jaataa he or khud ko jaan-boojhkar pratyaksh kar detaa he, taaki major konig use vaisili samaj kar goli chalaaen or vaisili ko konig kaa pataa chal jaae
 Danilov is martyred in this process
 yah sochakar ki vaisili mar chukaa he, konig mrity sharir ko jaanane ke liye nikal padate hai
 But a short time later, König realizes that he himself has been caught in a deadly move and is in Vicious's eyes
 konig vaisili ki taraf mudate hai or konig ke sar par goli daag kar unhen maar detaa he
 Two months later, Stalingrad is now free, Vassili finds Tania in a field-hospital

 Historiography or historiography makes sense of two things - the study of the development and methodology of history and the collected material related to the history of a subject
 itihaaskaar itihaashshastra kaa adhyayan vishyavaar karte hai, jaise- bharat kaa itihaas, japani samrajya kaa itihaas aadi
 The mainstay of history are the epochs and remains of the site which are found in some form or the other
 jivan kii bahumukhi vyapaktaa ke kaaran swalp saamagree ke sahare vigat yug athwa samaaj kaa chitranirmaan karnaa du:saadhy he
 The more the material gets, the more proportionally it becomes possible to present the outline of the bygone era and society
 paryaapt sadhano ke hote hue bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kalpanamishrit chitra nishchit rup se shuddh yaa satya hi hoga
 Therefore, due to lack of appropriate attention, some scholars say that the entirety of history is irretrievable, yet if our experience and knowledge is abundant, our art is rationalized for the investigation of historical material and imagination is controlled and developed, then our picture of the past Can be more humane and authentic
 saransh yah he ki itihaas kii rachana main paryaapt saamagree, vaigyanik dhang se uski jaanch, usase praapt gyaan kaa mahatv samajhane ke vivek ke saath hi saath aitihaasak kalpana kii shakti tathaa sajiv chithran kii kshamta kii aavashyaktaa he
 It should be remembered that history is neither a science by ordinary definition nor a mere imaginary philosophy or literary work
 in sabake yathochit sanmishran se itihaas kaa swaroop rachaa jaataa he
 History is more or less the same type of truth as science and philosophy
 jis prakaar vigyaan or darshanon main herpher hote hai usee prakaar itihaas ke chithran main bhi hote rahete hai
 With the help of man's increasing knowledge and resources, the paintings of history continue to be cremated, their antiquity and culture
 prayek yug apane-apane prashn uthaata he or itihaas se unka samaadhaan dhundhata rahata he
 That is why every era, society or person keeps on observing history with the vision of their questions
 yah sab hote hue bhi sadhano kaa vaigyanik anveshan tathaa nirikshan, kalkram kaa vichaar, paristhiti kii aavashyaktaaon tathaa ghatnaon ke pravaah kii baariki se chaanbin or unase parinaam nikaalane main sartakta or sanyam kii anivaaryta atyant aavashyak he
 Without them, there would be no difference between historical imagination and fantasy
 itihaas kii rachana main yah avashya dhyaan rakhana chahie ki usase jo chitra banaaya jaae vah nishchit ghatnaon or paristhitiyon par dridhtaa se aadhaarit ho
 Attempting to support mental, imaginary or arbitrary forms by historical events is strictly prohibited due to unforgivable defects
 yah bhi samaran rakhana aavashyak he ki itihaas kaa nirmaan bauddhik rachanaatmak kaary he atev aswabhaavik or asambhavya ko pramankoti main sthaan nahin diya ja saktaa
 Apart from this, the aim of history is to get specific knowledge
 kisi vishesh siddhant yaa mat kii pratishtha, prachaar yaa niraakaran athwa use kisi prakaar kaa andolan chalaane kaa saadhan bananaa itihaas kaa durupyog karnaa he
 By doing this, the importance of history is not destroyed, but instead of benevolence, it begins to degrade, which ultimately results in horrific consequences

 pashuon kii hatya karke vah apane kutumb ko paalataa tha
 He was indebted to a moneylender, but could not repay his loan on time
 krodhit sahuukaar ne shikari ko shivamath main bandi bana liya
 Coincidentally it was Shivratri that day
 ' The hunter meditated and kept listening to religious things related to Shiva
 chaturdashi ko usne shivaratri vrath kii katha bhi suni
 Just before dusk, the moneylender called him to him and talked about repaying the loan
 shikari agle din sara rin lautaa dene kaa vachan dekar bandhan se chhot gaya
 Like his daily routine he went out hunting in the forest
 lekin dinabhar bandi grih main rahane ke kaaran bhukh-pyaas se vyakul tha
 To hunt, he started making a halt on the vine tree on the banks of a pond
 bel vriksh ke neeche shivlinga tha jo vilvapatron se dhakaa hua tha
 Hunter could not find the person
 padaav banaate samay usne jo tahaniyaan todin, ve sanyog se shivlinga par giriin
 In this way, fasting and thirsty hunters were also fasted throughout the day and bell-sheets were also climbed on Shivling
 ek pahar raatri biit jane par ek garbhini mrigi talab par pani pine pahunchi
 As soon as the hunter drew an arrow on the bow, the antelope said, 'I am pregnant
 sheeghra hi prasav karuungi
 You will kill two creatures simultaneously, which is not right
 main bachche ko janm dekar sheeghra hi tumhaare samaksh prastut ho jaaoongi, tab maar lenaa
 The hunter loosened the cross and the deer disappeared into the wild bushes
 kuch hi der baad ek or mrigi udhar se nikali
 The hunter was over the moon
 sameep aane par usne dhanush par baan chadhaaya
 Seeing him, the deer politely pleaded, 'O Pardhi! i retired from the season a while ago
 kamaatur virahinee hum
 i am wandering in search of my beloved main apane pati se milakar sheeghra hi tumhaare paas aa jaaoongi
 ' The hunter let him go as well
 do baar shikaar ko khokar uskaa maathaa thanka
 He was in all sort of thoughts
 raatri kaa aakhri pahar biit rahaa tha
 Then another antelope escaped with her children
 shikari ke liye yah svarnim avasar tha
 He did not take long to shoot arrows at the bow
 vah tir chhodane hi vaala tha ki mrigi boli, 'he pardhi!' main in bacchon ko inke pita ke hawaale karke laut aauungi
 Do not kill me this time
 shikari hansaa or bolaa, saamne aae shikaar ko chhod duun, main aisa murkh nahin
 i have lost my prey twice before
 mere bachche bhukh-pyaas se tadap rahe honge
 In response, the deer again said, as you are maltreating your children, just like me too
 isliye sirf bacchon ke naam par main thodi der ke liye jeevandaan maang rahi hum
 Hey Pardhi! Trust me, i promise to leave them to their father and return immediately
 mrigi kaa deen swar sunakar shikari ko us par dayaa aa gai
 He let that chicken escape too
 shikaar ke abhaav main bel-vrikshapar baitha shikari belptr tod-todakar neeche phenkata ja rahaa tha
 When the dawn broke, a strong deer came on the same path
 shikari ne soch liya ki iskaa shikaar vah avashya karegaa
 Seeing the trunk of the hunter, he said in a loud voice, o brother! If you have killed three antelopes and small children coming before me, do not delay in killing me, so that i do not have to suffer even a single moment in their disconnection
 main un mrigiyon kaa pati hum
 If you have given them life, please give me some life too
 main unase milakar tumhaare samaksh upasthit ho jaaoongaa
 As soon as he heard the deer, the whole night cycle happened in front of the hunter, he narrated the whole story to the deer
 tab mrug ne kaha, 'meri teenon patniyaan jis prakaar pratigyabaddh hokar gai hai, meri mrityu se apane dharm kaa paalan nahin kar paaengi
 So, just as you have left him as a confidant, let me also go
 main un sabake saath tumhaare saamne sheeghra hi upasthit hota hum
 'fasting, night-awakening and climbing the bell leaf on the Shivling, the violent heart of the hunter was purged
 usamen bhagavad shakti kaa vaas ho gaya tha
 The bow and arrow were easily left from his hand
 bhagwaan shiv kii anukanpa se uskaa hinsak hriday kaarunik bhaavon se bhar gaya
 He started burning in the flame of repentance remembering his past deeds
 thodi hi der baad vah mrug sapariwaar shikari ke samaksh upasthit ho gaya, taaki vah unka shikaar kar sake, kintu junglee pashuon kii aisi satyata, satviktaa evam samuhik prembhaavana dekhakar shikari ko badi glani hui
 There was a burst of tears from his eyes
 us mrug parivaar ko na markar shikari ne apane kathor hriday ko jeev hinsa se hataa sadaa ke liye komal evam dayaalu bana liya
 All the Dev Samaj from Devalok were also watching this event

 But it is worth remembering that in agricultural economics, not only various problems related to agriculture are considered, but also various important rules of economics like, law of diminishing returns, demand law, law of supply etc

 There are various branches of economics, which throw a wide light on different sectors of the economy

 It studies the main economic problems related to agriculture
 krishi arthshaastra main ham farm prabandh, utpaadan falan, krishi vipanan, krishi vitt, krishi keemat aadi se sambandhit nitiyon kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Decision-making problems related to production and management are discussed in Farm Management

 These policies are based on the objectives achieved and the use of agricultural means

 Like, should futures trading of cotton be banned, if so, what will be the impact on the prices of cotton and cotton clothes? Should fertilizers be taxed? Should there be a tax on agricultural income? All these questions fall in the field of agricultural policy of agricultural economics

 The Indian Independence Act 1947 is a legislation passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, according to which Britain-ruled India was divided into two parts
 yah adhinium ko 18 july 1947 ko sweekrut hua or 15 agast 1947 ko bharat bant gaya
 Lord Mountbatten came to India for the partition of India and the quick transfer of power

 Initially, this power transfer was to be given to the Indian governments of divided India as Dominion status

 This included major provisions that were carried forward by the Mountbatten Plan

 It attempts to understand the decision-making process of buyers, both individually and in groups, such as how these emotions affect buying behavior
 yah is tarah ke logon kii aavashyaktaaon ko samajhane kii koshish main janasankhyikee or vyavhaar char ke rup main vyaktigat upabhoktaaon kii visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 It also tries to assess the impact on the consumer from groups such as family, friends, sports, reference groups and society in general
 aaj graahak jamkhori, kalabazari, milawat, bina maanak kii vastuon kii bikri, adhik daam, gyaranti ke baad sarvice nahin dena, har jagah thagi, kam naap-taul ityadi sankaton se ghira he
 Various laws have been made for customer protection, as a result, the customer has become dependent on the government today
 jo log gaiyrkanoonee kaam karte hai, jaise- jamkhori, kalabazari karne vaale, milawatkhor ityadi ko rajnatik sangrakshan praapt hota he
 Since customers are not organized, they are cheated everywhere
 graahak aandolan kii shuruuaat yaheen se hoti he
 The customer has to wake up and protect themselves
 viksit poonjeewaadi deshon main, jaisaa ki upar kaha gaya he, upabhoktavaadi samskruti utpaadan prakriya ko bina poonjeewaadi mulyon or dhaanche ko tode chaalu rakhane or viksit karne main sahaayak hoti he
 But in third world countries this culture has the opposite effect
 bharat jaise teesri duniya ke ke deshon main jahaan samrajyavaadee sampark se paramparaagat utpaadan kaa dhaanchaa tut gaya he or logon kii buniyadi jaruraton kii purti ke liye utpaadan ke tej vikaas kii jarurat he, vahaan upabhoktavaad ke asar se vikaas kii sambhaavnaayen kunthit ho gayi hai
 a new elite has arisen in these countries through the interaction of Western countries, which have adopted this consumerist culture
 is varg main bhi un vastuon kii bhukh jag gayi he jo pashchim ke viksit samaaj main madhyam varg or kushal mazdooron ke ek hisse ko uplabdh hone lageen hai
 The achievement of these items also increases their social standing
 at: is abhijaat varg main or isaki dekha-dekhi isse neeche ke madhyam varg or nimna madhyam varg main bhi scooter, tii
ve
, fries or vibhinn tarah ke saamaan or prasadhano ko praapt karne kii utkar abhilaashaa jag gayi he
 It has had two social consequences in our own country
 pehla, chunki yahi varg desh kii raajnneeti main sheersh sthanon par he, desh ke simit sadhano kaa upyog dhadlle se logon kii aam aavashyaktaa kii vastuon kaa nirmaan karne ke bajaay vaise udyogon or suvidhaon ke vikaas ke liye ho rahaa he jisase is varg kii upabhoktavaadi aakaankshaon kii purti ho sake
 Since this area of production is highly developed and capital intensive, dependence on foreign countries increases in the development of these industries
 mashin, takanic or gairajaruri vastuon ke aayaat par hamaare simit videshi mudrakosh kaa kshay hota he, or hamaara sabase vishaal aarthik saadhan jiske upbhog se desh kaa tej vikaas sambhav tha – yani hamaari shramashakti bekaar padi rah jaati he
 Due to the disregard of areas in which the country's large population can contribute to production, the standard of living of the common people either cannot be developed or falls down
 doosraa, chunki upabhoktavaad vyapak garibi ke bich kharchili vastuon kii bhukh jagaata he, usase bhrashtachar ko badhaava miltaa he
 Since the acquisition of goods is the basis of prestige in the aristocracy, irrespective of how these things are acquired, corruption gets an open exemption
 kam aay vaale adhikari apane adhikaron kaa durpyog kar jaldi se jaldi dhani ban janaa chaahate hai taaki anaavashyak saamaan ikattha kar saamaajik pratishtha praapt kar saken
 One of the gruesome consequences of this is the atrocities on dowry women
 badi sankhya main madhyamvarg ke noujvaan or unke mata – pita, jo apni aay ke bal par shaan badhaanevaali vastuon ko nahin kharid sakate, dahej ke madhyam se is laalasaa ko mitaane kaa suyog dekhte hai
 The ghost of these things is such that they have a demonic instinct on their head and they do not hesitate to torture or kill the destitute daughters-in-law
 bahuon kii bad rahi hatyaein is samskruti kaa sidhaa parinaam hai
 Some similar sentiments work behind crimes like dacoity
 raajnneetik bhrashtachar kaa to yah mul kaaran he
 Political people have many rights in their hands, but the scope of earning money in a fair way is less
 lekin chunki unki pratishtha unke rahan-sahan ke str par nirbhar karti he, unke liye apane adhikaron kaa durupyog kar dhan iktha karne kaa lobh sanvaran karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 In this way, the gap between the living standards of the people and the common people in the society, which has wealth and status and opportunities for corruption, increases
 isse bhi shaasha or shasiton ke bich kaa samvaad sutara tuutata he
 The ruling people become insensitive to the needs of the common people and the direction of production is dictated by the needs of the elite
 idhar aam jaruraton kii vastuon ke abhaav main logon kaa asantosh umadta evam uthal – puthal kii adhinayakawadi tareekon se jan-aandolan se nipatna chahta he
 Such is the basis of politics in most of the countries of the third world, in which rich minority people rule against common people through deceit and terror
 bharat ke gaanvon main jo thodaa bahut sthaneey aarthik aadhaar tha usko bhi is samskruti ne nasht kiya he
 The traditional economy of Indian villages was largely self-sufficient and the people of the village used to arrange for the collective services of the village such as means of irrigation, transport or assistance to the needy
 yah vyavastha jad or jarjar ho gayi thi
 And there was a lot of equality in rural society, yet there was a sense of collectivity
 haal tak gaanvon main paisevaalon kii pratishtha is baat se hoti thi ki ve saarvajanik kaamon jaise kuna, talab aadi khudwane, sadak marammat karwaane, skool or aushadhaalay aadi khulwaane par dhan kharch karen
 There was a lot of cost on this and before independence such service was usually done with such grants from the rural people
 yah sambhav is liye hota tha kyonki gaanv ke andar dhani logon kii bhi nijee aavashyaktaayen bahut kam thim or ve apane dhan kaa vyay pratishtha praapt karne ke liye aise kaamon par karte the
 For this reason, Western economists and sociologists have always complained that the level of consumption of Indian villages is very low, which is a major obstacle for the development of industries

 Customer behavior study is based on consumer buying behavior, with the customer playing three different roles of user, payer and buyer
 anusandhan upabhokta vyavhaar bhi kshetra main visheshgyon ke liye, bhavishyavaanee karnaa mushkil he ki dikhaaya gaya he
 Relationship marketing is an influential asset for the analysis of customer behavior as it has a keen interest in re-discovering the true meaning of marketing through re-affirmation of the importance of the customer or buyer
 ek bada mahatv bhi upabhokta pratidhaaran, graahak sambandh prabandhan, nijeekaran, anukulan or ek-se- ek vipanan par rakhaa gaya he
 Social functions can be classified into social choices and welfare functions

 The generating set indicates the number of options considered by consumers during the problem-solving process
 kabhi-kabhi yah bhi vichaar ke rup main janaa jaataa he, is set uplabdh vikalpon kii kul sankhya ke chote rishtedaar ho jaataa he
 How can marketing organizations increase the likelihood that their brand is part of generating sets of consumer? Consumers evaluate alternatives in terms of the functional and psychological benefits that they offer
 vipanan sanghathan upabhoktaaon kii maang he or isliye ek nirnay karne ke maamle main sabase mahatvapurn hai jo gun kar rahe hai kya laabh samajhane kii jarurat he
 It also needs to examine other brands of customer thought set to formulate the right plan for their own brand

 Organizations can use different technologies to achieve this goal

 The purchase is associated with the decision that the relevant internal psychological process is integration

 Consumerist culture has eliminated this aspect of village economy
 ab dhire – dhire gaanvon main bhi sampann log un vastuon ke peeche pagal ho rahe hai jo upabhoktavaadi samskruti kii dein hai
 Since the wealth of the rich people of the village is also limited, now all their extra money which was previously spent in social work has started to be spent on private frills and people started relying on government sources for the small collective service work of the village

 rashtriyavaadee, jo manch par pehle aae, videshi shashan se mukti chaahate the
 Liberals wanted liberation from the intervention of their own national governments
 samaajawaadee kuch der baad sakriy hue
 They wanted an assurance that governance should not be conducted for the benefit of the property class
 udaarataavaadi andolan ke yahi teen pramukh sutara the jinhen bahudhaa bhaawanaaon evam nitiyon kii aakarshak ulajhanon main tod marodakar bat liya jaataa tha
 All of these sutras were primarily inspired by the wrong interpretations of the feelings of the great French state revolution and the ideas of great men like the Russians
 is prakaar, udaarataavaad, bhinn prasangon main bhinn-bhinn arth rakhata tha
 But everywhere there was a common belief that the essential aspects of the feudal system should be overthrown by the elite leadership of society
 nav abhijaat varg-madhya varg-vikasshil audyogic kendron ke majdoor varg ke sahyog se is kranti ko sampann kare
 Later, its allied working class, who wanted the collective ownership of society on social freedom and the wealth produced, split up
 kintu abhi unhen ek saath rahanaa tha
 Of course, their original ideas were influenced, in part, by each other
 19veen shatabdi ke samooche purvardh main europe ke unnat deshon ke vyapaaree aarthik udaataratawaad main vishwaas rakhte the jiske anusaar vyapaar main aniyantrit pratispardhaa hi sarvottam evam sabase adhik nyaayayukt paddati maani jaati thi
 Its principles were first articulated by Adam Smith in his book titled "wealth of Nations", then in France by physiocrats and their followers
 vyaktigat vyapaariyon tathaa vyaktigat rajyon kii is aniyantrit pratispardhaa kaa parinaam, kuch samay ke liye, atyadhik laabhkar hi hua, yadhyapi yah laabh aviksit videshon ke swaarth tathaa swadesh krishi ko haani pahunchaakar hua
 In the middle of the 19th century, although the liberals of England, the heirs of the old "hwig" party, were completely different from traditional worshipers of civil and religious freedom
 england main to pehle "udaar" shabd se kuch videshi abhas bhi paaya jaataa tha, kyonki iskaa spasht sambandh france tathaa spain ke krantikari andolanon se tha
 But from the time of Lord John Russell after 1830, to the time of Gladston in the latter half of this century, the term also began to be introduced in England and considered respected
 jaan stuart mil kii prasiddh pustika "swatantraaa" dwaara ise saidhantik maryaada bhi mili
 This led to the idea that human personality is valuable and that, good or bad, the free conduct of individual power free from all kinds of state control is the root cause of progress
 raajnneetik kshetra main isaki uplabdhi vaidhaniktaa tathaa sansadeey loksatta kii disha main hui or aarthik kshetra main swatantra vyapaar ne nakaaratmak kaarykram main, jisaki manyata yah thi ki kaary prarambh karne kaa adhikaar rajyaniyantran se nirbandh vyakti ko hi praapt he
 But social needs made the change inevitable

 And now an imbalance between individualism and socialism has been established
 udaarataavaad kii do vichaardhaaraon ke bich fas jane ke kaaran idhar bhavishya kaa uskaa maarg kuch spasht nahin he
 From time to time, it has demonstrated its liveliness
 jaise, britain, main 1906-11 ke bich, jab rudh udaarataavaad ke virodh ke baavjood saamaajik beemaa se sambandhit kanoon bana daalaa gaya, athwa, dwitiya mahayuddh ke baad bhi, jab wiliam bevarij ne ek lokhitkaari rajya kii ruparekha taiyaar kar daali
 But liberalism is impaired in influencing manpower, this failure in this direction has been proved after many years
 germany main natsivaad ke saamne isaki bhayankar asafalataa siddh ho chuki he
 In fact, its great inability to reorganize by mobilizing public enthusiasm has been proved
 saamaajik pragati ke saath udaarataavaad dag nahin bhar sakaa
 Nevertheless its fundamental principles are freedom of research and thought, freedom of speech and exchange are still required, because without these, rational thought and action cannot be possible
 madar india 1957 main bani bhartiya film he jise mehboob khan dwaara likhaa or nirdeshit kiya gaya he
 The film stars Nargis, Sunil Dutt, Rajendra Kumar and Raj Kumar in the lead roles
 film mehboob khan dwaara nirmit aurat kaa rimek he
 It is the story of Radha, a woman living in a poverty-stricken village, who, after facing many difficulties, tries to take care of her children and avoid the evil vassal

 The film was the first Indian film sent to the Academy Awards
 film kii shuruyaat vartmaan kaal main gaanv ke liye ek pani kii nahar ke puraa hone se hoti he
 Radha, as the mother of the village, inaugurates the canal and looks back at her past when she was a new bride
 radha or shaamu kii shaadi kaa karcha radha kii saas ne sukhilala se udhaar lekar uthaaya tha
 Due to this, Radha gets trapped in the never ending cycle of poverty and hard work
 udhaar kii sharten vivaadaaspad hoti he parantu gaanv ke sarpanch sukhilala ke hit main faisla sunaate hai jiske tahat shaamu or radha ko apni fasal kaa ek tihaai hissaa sukhilala ko 500 ke byaaz ke taur par dena hoga
 To eradicate his poverty, Shamu tries to plow his land further, but both his hands are crushed under a stone
 apni majaburi se sharminda va auron dwaara beizzati ke kaaran vah faisla karata he ki vah apane parivaar ke kisi kaam kaa nahin or unhen chhod kar hameshaa ke liye chale jaataa he
 Soon Radha's mother-in-law also passes away
 radha apane donon beton ke saath kheton main kaam karnaa jari rakhti he or ek or bete ko janm detii he
 Sukhilala proposes to marry her to overcome her poverty, but Radha refuses to sell herself
 ek toofaan gaanv ko apni chapet main le letaa he or sari fasal nasht ho jaati he
 Radha's younger son is killed in the storm
 sara gaanv palaayan karne lagata he parantu radha ke manaane par sabhi ruk kar waapas gaanv ko sthapit karne kii koshish karte he
 The film reaches back years when both Radha's remaining sons, Birju and Ramu, are now grown up
 birju apane bachapan main sukhilala ke bartaav kaa pratishodh lene ke liye gaanv kii ladakiyon ko chhedana shuru kar detaa he, khaas kar sukhilala kii beti ko
 In contrast, Ramu is of a very calm nature and soon marries
 haalanki ab vah ek pita he par uski patni jald hi parivaar main maujuud garibi kaa shikaar ho jaati he
 Birju's anger finally takes a dangerous form and on the instigation strikes Sukhilala and her daughter
 use gaanv se nikaal diya jaataa he or vah ek daaku ban jaataa he
 On the day of Sukhilala's daughter's wedding, he comes back for revenge and tries to kill Sukhilala and drive her daughter away
 radha, jisane yah vaada kiya tha ki birju kisi ko koi haani nahin pahunchayegaa, birju ko goli maar detii he jo uski banhon main dam tod detaa he
 The film ends with Radha's flowing water when the canal is opened in the present day, which slowly reaches the fields
 film kaa sheershak amareeki lekhika catherine myo dwaara 1927 main likhit pustak madar india se liya gaya he jisame unhone bhartiya samaaj, dharm or samskruti par hamalaa kiya tha
 In the book, Mayo attacked the plight of Indian women, discrimination against untouchables, animals, washed soil and politicians in protest against the demand for Indian independence
 myo ne pure bharat main gusse kaa mahole utpann kar diya or unki pustakon ko unke putale sahit jalaayaa gaya
 Mahatma Gandhi also opposed the book and said "it is a report written by the Gutter Inspector"
 is pustak ke virodh main pachaas se adhik pustaken or chitthiyaan prakashit kii gai jisamen myo kii galatiyon or amareeki logon main bharat ke prati galat vichaaron ke itihaas ko darshaya gaya
 Khan took care of the film and its title in 1952
 us varsh oktober main unhone aayaat adhikariyon ke paas film ke nirmaan kaa prastaav rakhaa
 In 1955 the Indian Ministry of Information and Technology Department came to know about the title of the upcoming film and asked Mehboob Khan to send the film's narrative so that it could be reviewed
 unhen is baat kaa dar tha ki kahin film bharat ke rashtri hit ko thes na pahunchaae
 The story of this film was deliberately written in such a way that reflects the position of women in Indian society, the growing attraction of men and the determination to be self-respecting
 khan ko prerana amareeki lekhak parl es
 bak or unki da good arth va da madar pustakon se mili jinhen sidney franklin ne 1937 or 1940 main filmon main rupantarit kiya tha
 Khan used all these things in his 1940 film Aurat which was the real inspiration of Mother India
 khan ne samvedansheel tareeke se kahani par kaary kiya or unhen dialog likhane main vajahat mirza va es
 ali raza ne madad kii
 The film later went on to be an inspiration for many films, such as Yash Chopra's Deewar, starring Amitabh Bachchan in Unda and later in Bangaru Talli in Telugu and Punia Boomi in Tamil

 janmapatri main praaniyon kii janmakalik grahasthiti se jivan main honevaali shubh athwa ashubh ghatnaon kaa nirdesh kiya jaataa he
 There is a lot of variation in the nature of a horoscope, the law of law and its form in other countries and cultures of the world, and in the systems of auspicious instructions
 akaash main do prakaar ke prakaash pind dikhaai dete hai
 The first ones which appear stable are called Nakshatras
 duusare ve jo nakshatron ke bich sadaa apana sthaan parivartit karte rahete hai, grah kehalaate hai
 The earth rotates from west to east on its axis every twenty four hours, due to which all the planets and constellations rise in the east and go to the west and are seen to be disturbed
 kintu prati din dhyaan se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki grah nity akashiya pindon kii yatra ke vipareet, pashchim se purv kii ore chalaa karte hai
 Thus, the path by which the sun completes one round of the constellation in the year is called the revolution
 pracheen jyotishiyon ne isi krantivrutt kaa baarah bhagkar unhen raashi kii sangya di he
 In these, some tarapunjas form figures like creatures
 raashiyon ke naam unheen jeevon ke anusaar- mesh, vrish, mithun, kark, singh, kanya, tula,, brishchik, dhanu makar, kumbh, min rakhe gaye hai
 Due to the daily movement of the Earth, the cycle of twelve zodiacs revolves around our horizon in twenty-four hours
 inamen jo raashi kshitij main lagi hoti he use lagn kehete hai
 Here the lagna and its zodiac signs and the planets like Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu etc
 are the basic instruments of the horoscope
 lagn se aarambhkar in baarah rashiyaan ko dvaadvash bhav kehete hai
 Among these, the ascendant is local
 shesh bhav sharir se sambandhit vastuon ke rup main gruhit hai
 Such as lagna, wealth, ease, happiness, children, repu, jaya, death, religion, income and expenditure are the forms of these 12 expressions
 in bhaavon kii sthapana is dhang se kii gai he ki manushya ke jivan kii sampurna aavashyaktaayen inhen main samavisht ho jaati hai
 Of these, the first, fourth, seventh and tenth are these four expressions called center main
 vastut: akaash main inaki sthiti hi is mukhyata kaa kaaran he
 The lagna is said to be the coincidence point of the east horizon and the circle of revolution, the seventh is also the coincidence point of the west horizon and the circle of revolution
 aise hi dakshinottar vrutt or krantivrutt kaa vah sanyog bindu jo hamaare kshitij se neeche he chaturth bhav tathaa kshitij se upar hamaare shir kii ore kaa sanyog bindu dasham bhav kehalaata he
 Both of these centers and other life-related needs and outcomes are places
 lagn ke dahini ore vyay he, bain ore dhan kaa ghar he
 The fourth has right and brothers and might, on the left are children and lore
 saptam sthaan ke dahini ore shatru or vyaadhi hai to bain ore shatru or vyaadhi hai to bain ore mrityu he
 The tenth is fate on the right and income on the left
 janmapatri dwaara praaniyon ke jivan main ghatit honevaale parinaamon ke taratmyon ko batalaane ke liye in baarah raashiyon ke swami maane gaye saat grahon main paraspar maitri, shatruta or tatasthta kii kalpana kii gai he or in swaabhaavik sambandhon main bhi visheshta batalaane ke liye taatkaalik maitri, shatruta or tatasthta kii kalpana dwaara adhimitra, adhishathru aadi kalpit kiye gaye he
 Similarly, the higher zodiac signs of the planets have also been conceived for the above purpose only
 in kalpanaaon ke anusaar kisi bhav main sthit grah yadi apane grih main ho to bhavafal uttam, mitra ke grih main madhyam or shatru ke grih main nimna koti kaa hoga
 If such planets are in their high, then the result is good and low, then it will be inferior
 iske madhya main anupaat se falon kaa taratamya laana hota he
 From the immediate friendship, enmity, parity, etc
, there has to be more reduction in the good results specified by natural friendship etc
 janmapatri main mangal kii raashi mesh or brishchik tathaa makar ucch he
 Taurus and Libra Venus and Pisces are high
 mithun or kanya budh kii apni raashi tathaa kanya hi uskaa ucch bhi he
 Cancer Moon's sign and Taurus are high
 singh surya kii raashi tathaa mesh mithunucch he
