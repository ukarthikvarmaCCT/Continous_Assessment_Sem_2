 Often all decorators are made by connecting one or more diodes in a particular order
 adhik diod ke prayog se praayah disi apekshaakrit adhik shuddh hoti he arthath isamen In this type of rectifier, only half of the A-C is sent under load while the remaining half is prevented from entering the load
 yah bahut kam shakti ke output ke liye hi prayog main liya jaataa he, adhik shakti ke liye nahin
 Because it transfers electric power with very little efficiency
 ek phej ke paripathon main half-wave ractifire keval ek diod kaa istemaal karke banaaya ja saktaa he
 
 teen-feji supplai main iske liye teen diod lagate hai
 Voltage Regulation = Good everej voltage = ve maiks / pai Average current = i max / pi aaremes voltage yaa prabhavi voltage = ve maximum / 2 RMS current or effective current = i max / 2 dakshata = 40

 iske liye 6-diod lagate hai
 For example, today's automobiles have a 3-phase bridge alternator with a 3-phase alternator that creates DC to charge the battery

 Nowadays, due to the availability of switches such as MOSFET and IGBT, which can be switched on at high frequency, this type of compensation has started to be used

 Annamani then eats his food, and the clownfish eats what remains
 clounfish anemani ko bachaate hai jab persite anemani kaa khaanaa ko churaane kii koshish karte hai
 Clownfish do not die in anemonee because the clownfish has a mucus that would avoid the anemonee's poison

 mana ki a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a} }}} =a1e1 + a2e2 + a3e3 aban b → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {b} }}} =b1e1 + b2e2 + b3e3, haijahan e1, e2, e3 lamb ikai sadish hai
 Then the sum of a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a xxrep 4 } and b → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {b xxrep 4 } will be as follows- yadi The difference between vector a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a xxrep 4 } and b → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {b xxrep 4 } will be as follows- kisi sadishon ko do yaa do se adhik sadishon ke yoga ke rup main nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 Obviously this can be done in infinite ways
 kintu kisi diye hue sadish ko kinhin do dishaao main viyojan maatr ek prakaar se hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Often the two directions are mutually perpendicular as shown in the figure
 ek sadish ko ek adish se guna kiya jaay to parinaam ek sadish hoga jo purvokt sadish kii disha main hoga
 For example, if a vector a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a xxrep 4 } is multiplied by a scalar, the product will be - punah do sadishon kaa adish yaa dot gunanfal ek adish raashi hoti he
 The dot product of two vectors is defined as follows- kisi tribhuj kii do sanlagn bhujaayen kram se do sadishon ko nirupit karen to tribhuj kii teesri bhujaa vipareet kram main in do sadishon kaa yoga nirupit karegi
 If more than two vectors are decorated in such a way that the top of the first vector has the foot of the second vector and the head of the second has the foot of the third, then the sum of all these vectors is equal to the vector joining the foot of the first vector from the top of the last vector
 Will happen

 "azarbaijan" naam ke udgam ko lekar kai prakaar kii avadharanaayen he
 The most prevalent theorem is that the name derives from the word "atropton"
 atropat farsi akaminoid rajvansh ke samay main ek kshatrap tha, jise sikandar mahaan ne akraman karke parrast kiya or atropaton ko swadhinata mili
 At that time this area was known as Media Atropatia or Atropatin

 Each flower has its own special type of structure to encourage pollen
 kiliestogamas phool swaparagit hote hai, jiske baad ve khul bhi sakate hai yaa shaayad nahin bhi
kai prakaar ke viola or salvi prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Insectivorous flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 saamanytah phulon ke anek bhaagon main ek granthi hoti he jise paraag kaha jaataa he jo in kiton ko aakarshith karti hai
 Some flowers have structures called madhursa instructions that tell pollinators where to find honey
 phool paragakon ko khushboo or rang se bhi aakarshith karte hai
 Yet some flowers mimic or imitate to attract pollinators
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch orchid kii prajatiyaan phool srujit karti hai jo kii maadaa madhumakhi ke rang, aakaar or khushboo se mail khate hai
 Flowers are also experts in forms and stamens have such an arrangement that it is ensured that the pollen grains are transferred to the pollinator when it lands on its attracting Vastu
 However, the pollen transfers the pollen to the pistil in all the flowers that are arranged exactly equally

 While the pollen of insectivorous flowers is prone to large and glutinous grains which are rich in protein, pollen of aerated flowers is mostly of small grains, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 phool-paudhe dwichhidranviy hote hai jo ki do prakaar ke chhidron kaa srijan karte hai
 Pollen and ovules are formed in separate organs, but a typical flower bears bisporangiate strobilus that has both organs
 phool ko ek sanshodhit tana kaha jaataa he, chote internodon or bering ke saath, iske nodes aise sanrachit hote hai jo kii ati sansodhit pattey ho sakate hai
 In short, the structure of a flower is on a modified stem on an anterior meristem, which does not grow continuously
 Flowers are attached to the plant in some ways
 yadi phool tane se jude nahin hote or unka nirmaan paton par hota he to unhen avrint kaha jaataa he jab phool kaa pushpan hota he, to use ek phuleey pushpan kaha jaataa he
 If the flowering flower ends in clusters of flowers, then each trunk that carries the flower is called pedicel
 pushpan vaala tana ek antak rup srujit karata hai jise phool kii kursi yaa uskaa patr kehete hai phool ke hisse patr ke upar vorl main vyavasthit hote hai
 The four main parts of the whorl are as follows: yaddapi upar varnit phulon kii sanrachana ko 'adarsh' sanrachanaatmak yojana mana ja saktaa he, parantu paudhon kii jati is yojana se hatakar badlaav ke vyapak bhinnata ko dikhaate hai
 These changes are very important in the development of flowering plants and botanists use it intensively to establish the relationship between plant species
 masalan phool-paudhon ki do upjatiyaan kaa bhed unke prayek vorl ke phuleey ango ko lekar ho saktaa he: ek dwibipatri ke vorl main adarsh rup main chaar yaa paanch ang hote hai or monocoteledon main teen yaa teen ke gunank vaale ang hote hai
 a group pistil may have only two carpels, or may not be related to the generalization of monocots and dicots given above
 jaisaa ki upar varnit kiya gaya he ki vyaktik phulon ke zyaadaatar naslon main jayang or punkesar dona hote hai
 Botanists describe these flowers as complete, bisexual, hermaphrodite
 phir bhi kuch paudhon ki naslon main phool apurna yaa ek lingeey hote hai: yaa to keval punkesar yaa strikesar angon ko dhaaran kiya hue
pehle maamle main agar ek vishesh paudha jo ki yaa to maadaa yaa purush he to aisi nasl ko dioisius mana jaataa he
 But if a sexual male or female flower appears on the same plant, such a species is called monoecious
 mul yojana se phulon ke badlaav par atirikt vichaar-vimarsh kaa ullekh phulon ke mul bhaagon vaale lekhon main kiya gaya he
 In species where there is more than one flower at the same peak, which is also called a joint flower - a collection of such flowers is also known as inflorescence, with the term having a specific arrangement on the stem of the flower

 Eg rose or trillium
 When the flowers divide and form only a line that forms the components, such flowers are irregular or zygomorphic eg snapdragon / majus or mostly orchids
 ek phool kaa formula, ek tarika he jisase ek phool kii sanrachana kaa pratinidhitiv ek vishesh akshar, ank yaa pratik ke dwaara kiya jaataa he

 Flowers are reproductive organs that mediate sperm from linking pollen to the ovule / testicles, normally from one plant to another, but many plants can pollinate their own flowers

 Sexual reproduction produces unique offspring, ready to adapt
 phulon kii ek vishisht sanrachana hoti he jo kii unhen ek hi nasl ke paraag ko ek paudhe se dusre paudhe main sthantarit karne ke liye prerit karti he
 Many plants depend on external factors for the transfer of pollen between flowers, including air and animals, especially pests
 Very large animals such as birds, bats, and dwarf poses can also be employed / employed / used
 The period of time in which this process takes place is called anthesis
 ko aakarshith karti hai
 Plants cannot move from one place to another, so many flowers grow in a dispersed population to attract animals to transfer pollen to each flower
 phool jo ki kit-paraagit hote hai unhen kitapargeey kaha jaataa hai jo kii latin main kit-premi ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These can be significantly modified with insects pollinated by co-development, usually in different parts of the flower there are glands called sweet organs that attract animals that are looking for nutritious sweet
 pakshiyon or madhumakhiyon main rang drushti hoti he, jo ki unhen "rangile" phool dhundne main yogya banaate hai
 Some flowers have madhuras directors / directives that show pollinators looking for madhuras, which can only be seen in ultraviolet light, which is visible only to bees and insects
 phool paraagan kartaaon ko gandh or kuch gandh hamaare soonghney kii shakti ke liye bhi sukhad hote hai
 The smell of all flowers does not appeal to humans, many flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh, and flowers that smell like dead animals, often called carrion flowers, include reflexia, titanarum and Paupau of North America
 phool jo ki raat ke aagantukon dwaara paraagit hote hai, sambhavit he ko ve paraagan kartaaon ko aakarshith karne ke liye apane gandh par dhyaan kendrit karte hai aise phool zyaadaatar safed hote hai
 Still others use mimicry to attract pollinators, for example the flowers of some species of some orchids match the color, shape and fragrance of bees
 nar madhumakhi aise hi phulon main se ek phool se dusre phool par saathi kii talash main ghoomte rahete hai
 The mechanism of pollination by the plant depends on how pollination is used
 adhikansh phool apane paraagan ke tareeke ko lekar mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 Insectivorous: Flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 zyaadaatar ve aakaaron / roopon main visheshgy hote hai or punkesar kii aisi vyavastha hoti he ki yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki paraag ke daanen paraagan par sthaanantarit ho jaayen jab vah apane aakarshith vastu par utarataa he kai phulon kii ek hi prajati ke is aakarshneey vastu ko paane ke liye, paragankarta un sabhi phulon main paraag ko stigma main sthantarit kar detaa he jo kii bilkul sateek rup se samaan rup main vyavasthit hote hai
 Many flowers rely only on the proximity between the parts of the flower for pollination
 anya jaise kii sarasenia yaa maadaa sleeper orchid ke paas i sunishchit dhaancha hota he jo ki aatmaparagan kaa nirodh karte hue paraagan ko nishchit karata he
 Aphrodisiac flowers: Use of air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, rag grasses of Amboria species and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators due to which they do not have a tendency to 'showy flowers'
 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 Bees and bumblebees actively accumulate aerated pollen corns, although they are not of much importance
 kuch phool swaparagit hote hai or un phulon kaa istemaal karte hai jo kabhi nahin khilte, yaa phool khilne se pehle swaparagit jo jate hai, in phulon ko clisotogamas kaha jaataa he kai prakaar ke viola or salvia prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific types of bacteria
 udahaaran ke liye kai phool ek vishisht keet jati se keval ek keet ko hi aakarshith karte hai, atah safal prajnan ke liye keval us keet par nirbhar karte hai
 This close relationship is often taken as an example of coexistence, as flowers and pollinators are believed to grow over a long period to match each other's needs
 ye ghanisht sambandh vilopan ke nakaaratmak prabhaav ke rup main yogic ho jate hai
 In such a relationship, the deletion of even one means that the deletion of almost the other member also
 The reason for some endangered plant species is a decrease in the population of dying pollinators
 kuch phulon main punkesar or strikesar donon swanishechan main sakasham hote hai, jo ki bijon ke utpaadan ke avasar badha detaa he parantu anuvanshik vividhta ko simit kar detaa he
 Extreme cases of self-fertilization occur in flowers that are always self-fertile, such as many miscreants
 In contrast, many plant breeds have their own ways of preventing self-fertilization

 aam dharna yah he ki prarambh se hi phulon kaa kaary, pashuon ko prajnan prakriya main shaamil karnaa rahaa he
 Pollen can disintegrate even without bright / golden and clear appearance, so it becomes an obligation to use the plant's resources until it provides no other benefit
 a proposed reason for the sudden presence of fully grown flowers is that they have evolved in a different environment, such as an island or chain of islands, where the plants that held them had a highly specialized relationship with certain animals
 Have evolved from, as in present-day / today, insular breeds / ethnicity

 Likewise, many fruits that are used in the reproduction of the plant come from the expansion of the parts of the flower, often the fruit is a device that depends on the animals that want to eat it, thus scattering those seeds
 Who are in that fruit
