 cabinet, pradhanmantri dwaara chaynit or raashtrapati dwaara niyukt mantriyon se bana hota he
 The Constitution of India does not specify any special qualifications for the post of Prime Minister
 parantu ek aavashyakta zarur nirdhaarit kii gai he: pradhanmantri ke paas loksabhaa athwa rajyasabha kii sadsyta honi chahie, or unke paas loksabhaa main bahumat kaa samarthan hona chaiye
 If at the time of appointment, the eligible person is not a member of either of the two houses of the Indian Parliament, then it is mandatory for him to get the membership of Parliament within 6 months of the appointment otherwise his prime ministership will be rejected
 atah pradhanmantritv ke daavedaar ke paas, ek saansad hone kii sari arhataayen hona chaiye
 The 84th Article of the Fifth Part of the Indian Constitution specifies the qualifications of an MP, according to: koi vyakti sansad ke kisi sthaan ko bharne ke liye chune jane ke liye arhit tabhi hoga jab— As specified in the third point, the eligible will have to live up to any eligibility of eligibility passed by the Parliament in future and since the Prime Minister is mandatory to be an MP, the Prime Minister's eligible to be eligible to be a member of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, some other Qualifications also have to be met, including a person with a distorted character or not being declared insolvent, voluntarily

 Also, the membership of the eligible is also terminated by the motion-approved expulsion from the House
 niyukti ke pashchaat, inamen se, purvakthith kisi bhi arhataaon par, pradhanmantri kii ayogyata, kisi vidhik nyaayalay main siddh kii jaati he, to, us vyakti kaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya jaataa he, or use pradhanmantri ke pad se nishkasit kar diya jaataa he
 The oath of office to the Prime Minister is administered by the President
 pad par niyukti hetu, bhavi padaadhikari ko do shapath lene kii anivaaryta he
 Both these oaths are specified in the Third Schedule of the Indian Constitution, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 and 219): shapath yaa pratigyaan ke praroop: Format of 1 Ministerial Oath: 2 gopneeyata kii shapath kaa praroop : In principle, the incumbent Prime Minister, "president of the Presidency", holds office
 raashtrapatipad ke vipareet, pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal ke liye koi kaal-seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he
 Therefore, a sitting Prime Minister can remain on the Prime Minister indefinitely, provided that the President has "confidence" in him
 iskaa vaastavik arth yah he kii ek vyakti keval tab tak pradhanmantri pad par bana rah saktaa he, jabatak loksabhaa main bahumat kaa vishwash uske paksh main he
 However, the full term of the Lok Sabha is 5 years, after which new elections are held, and the new assembly again passes a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister, if the newly elected assembly declares a distrust in the Prime Minister, then the term of the Prime Minister ends
 it happens
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri kaa ek puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh kaa hota he, jiske baad uski punahsamiksha hoti he
 However, the term of the Prime Minister can be terminated before 5 years, if due to any reason, pass a no-confidence vote against the Lok Sabha Government or if for any reason, the Prime Minister's membership of the Parliament is declared void, the Prime Minister may, at any time, The resignation of office can be done by handing over a written resignation to the President

 There is no time limit on the tenure of the Prime Minister nor any age limit has been specified
 bharat praveshdwar Article 74 of the Constitution of India expressly requires the presence of the Prime Minister to preside over and run the Council of Ministers
 uski mrityu yaa tyaagptr kii dasha me samast parishad ko pad chhodna pasta he
 He alone constitutes the Council of Ministers
 raashtrapati mantrigan kii niyukti uski salaah se hi karte hai
 The Department of Minister's Department also determines the same
 cabinet ke kaary kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 He also gives instructions to the administration of the country
 sabhi nitigat nirnay vahi letaa he
 The link between the President and the Council of Ministers is also the same
 mantriparishad kaa pradhan pravaktaa bhi vahi he
 He leads parliamentary debates in the name of the council
 sansad me parishad ke paksh me ladi ja rahi kisi bhi bahes me vah bhaag le saktaa he
 The coordination between the minister also does the same
 vah kisi bhi mantralay se koi bhi soochna mangava saktaa he
 Due to all these reasons, the Prime Minister is considered the most important political personality of India
 bhartiya pradhanmantripad ke varchasv va mahatv kaa sabase ahm kaaran he, uske padaadhikari ko pradaan kii gai kaaryakari shaktiyaan
 Article 74 of the Constitution establishes the office of Prime Minister, and specifies that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the head, who shall provide "advice and assistance" to the President of India
 tathaa anuchhed 75 yah sthapit karata he keemntriyon kii niyukti, raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar kii jaayegi, evam mantri ko vibhinn kaarybhaar bhi raashtrapati, pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar hi denge
 Therefore, the constitution specifies that where the President of India has constitutional executive authority, but because the President of India only acts in favor of the Prime Minister in these relations, in reality, the Prime Minister exercises these executive powers as he wishes
 
 in vidhaanon dwaara samvidhan yah sthapit karata he, kii bharat ke rashtrapramukh hone ke naate, raashtrapati par nihit saare kaaryakari adhikaar, apratyaksh rup se, pradhanmantri hi kiya karenge, tathaa sampurna mantriparishad ke pradhan honge tathaa anuchhed 75 dwaara mantriparishad kaa gathan, mantriyon kii niyukti evam unka kaarybhaar saunpna bhi pradhanmantri kii ichha par chhod diya gaya he, balki mantriyon or mantralayon ke sambandh main samvidhan, pradhanmantri ko puri khuli chhot pradaan karata he
 The Prime Minister can include, remove, appoint or suspend any person in his cabinet
 kyonki mantriyon kii niyukti raashtrapati dwaara keval pradhanmantri kii salaah par hoti he, atah iskaa arth yah he kii kendriya mantriparishad vaastavik rup se pradhanmantri kii pasand ke logon dwaara nirmit hoti he, jisamen ve apni pasandanusaar kabhi bhi pher-badal kar sakate he
 At the same time, giving various duties to ministers also depends entirely on the will of the Prime Minister; She can assign any ministry or assignment to any of her ministers, take away or assign any other charge / ministry
 in maamlo main sambandhit mantriyon se salaah-mashwara karne kii, yaa unki anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii koi sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 Rather, there is no constitutional obligation of any kind on the Prime Minister to obtain the advice or permission of the Minister or Ministers concerned in any of the foregoing matters regarding Ministers and Ministries
 ve kabhi bhi apni icchaanusaar, kisi bhi mantri ko mantripad se istifa dene ke liye bhi kah sakate he, or yadi vah mantri, istifa dene se inkaar kar detaa he, to ve raashtrapati se kah kar use pad se nilambit bhi karvaa sakate hai

 upss are made in a variety of ways and apart from providing supplies for a limited time, they can do more things - such as voltage-control, frequency-control, power coefficient enhancement, and improve the quality of the device, and so on
 upies main urja-sanchay karne kaa koi ek saadhan hota he, jaise bydaree, tej gati se chaalit flihvil, aaweshit kiya hua sandharitra yaa ek atichaalak kundalee main pravaahit atyadhik dhara
 upss are different from auxiliary power sources such as standby generators, etc
 in the case that when power goes out they interfere with the power received by the concerned equipment for a negligible time, so that the work of that device is not interrupted or hindered
 upies kaa upyog computaron, aankada kendra, sanchaar upkarnon, aadi ke saath praaia: kiya jaataa he jahaan ki vidyut jane se koi durghatana ho sakati he; mahatvapurn aankade nasht hone kaa dar ho; vyapaar kaa nuksaan aadi ho saktaa ho
 UPS not only protects the computer from loss in case of over-voltage, but also provides power to the computer for some time after the power supply is gone, allowing users to save their work and keep the computer correct
 Ways to shut down
 yadi computer kii vidyut aapurti ekadam se chali jaae yaa asthir ho jaye to isse hard drive or ram kharaab hone kii sambhaavna rahati he tathaa madraboard bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 UPS must also have voltage control, so that UPS can protect the computer from this danger
 ye dhyaan rakhana chaiye ki upies ko bahari upkarnon se overlod na karen jaise anaavashyak printer, scinar or fax mashin aadi lagaana
 Never plug the printer into the battery back up system

 swissover karne kaa rispance time, jise swimming time bhi kehete hai, 2 se 10 minute hota he
 Most switching-mode power supplies have a hold-up time of less than 16 minutes, which is higher than the ups's switching time, which will not cause computer shutdown
 vartmaan main milane vaale adhiktar upies line interective upies hote hai
 They control the input AC power to a limit and the battery is charged with AC power
 itnaa hi nahin, is tarah ke upies chote aakaar ke hote hai or adhiktar utpaadakon ke paas uplabdh hote hai
 Online UPS UPS are comparatively expensive

 Since there is no direct connection to the AC line, it does not affect UPS in the line

 In a case where the complaining party of the breach has not suffered loss or a legal contract in injury to maintain the sense of loss, there is nothing to compensate him, there is nothing to rectify, nothing has changed
 Or satisfied
 Therefore, he will not be entitled to compensation

 In the Indian Iron and Steel Company, the court was one of the Calcutta Highs, a Division Bench in the context of a contract to deal with the scope of an Indian 74S, trainee under the Act which went down-training contract, which vested in him In violation of a particular term of service for a company agreed to pay a certain amount of time and damages
 The Bench of the Calcutta High Court at the scene was compromised for subsequent breach of the condition in the Government of the payment of damages redress, or immaterial advocacy to prove it is particularly open to damages and to sue it For the management of loss prevention recovery

 Those people understand for the company that they are always forbidden to join and not offer options
 One of the reasons stated by the newcomers is that the main technical work of the company "did not provide them good"
 Companies never promise to deliver technology specific nor do they promise to deploy anyone specific
 Anyway most of such kind are those crib which people could not write code lines basically even some good ones
 Any company spends a lot of IT resources to train and rent for money
 It is basically their right to guard their own interests
 If we do not accept the conditions and conditions in employment, nothing prevents us from accepting the offer
 It is about not accepting us to offer, but then signing the crib and bond

 This would mean that if your future employer is on a background check for cases and criminal records to the civil court, then there is the possibility of you not hiring them
 In some situations, employers not only file but also dispute the employee against the case, including the employer who has hired them as a party
 If the employer who has hired you feels the heat, that action can ditch you to avoid getting into judicial and prolonged attempts

 As per 27 seconds the Indian Act, terms and conditions of the contract are only valid during the existence of the contract laid down in the contract
 ise samaapt anubandh nahin kiya ja saktaa he ke baad lagu kiya
 In Superintendance of company vs Kirshna mugai it was stated that the contract in the business of restraint chooses one which restricts one future party after another in his freedom to carry on with such or in such manner and profession His business business, he as individuals
 a contract of this class is void prima facie, but it becomes binding on the evidence that the restriction is being justified in terms of one of the justified circumstances in the community and even the parties themselves
 During the period of the ban on service, fidelity competitions are normally valid and the duty of can be done on the basis of servant than implied law
 In cases such restriction is reasonable, generally, in relation to being in the interest of the employer and for the employee who receives hardship does not question whether the wage period would be inappropriate for any reason
 ek se poocha kii lagaataar sawaalon ja rahaa he ki yah he ki kya niyokta company sakate main bal kaam karne ke liye karmchaaree

 keval ek cheez he ki ek niyokta kya kar sakate hai kshati ke liye mukadmaa karne ke liye he
 At the same time if the employment secret business did something involved and if the court feels that the previous employer's concern is indeed valid then it can take an injunction to stop the employee taking the work
 But in this case it is rare rare

 echivi -1 chimpanji or pashchimi africa main rahane vaale gorila main paae janevaale vishaanu hai, jabaki echivi -2 saanwale mangabeyon main paae jane vaale vishaanu hai
 HIV-1 can be further divided into groups
 echivi -1 em group vishaanu prabal hota he or aids ke liye jimmedaar he
 Group m can be divided into multiple variants according to genetic sequence details
 upaprakaron main se kuch adhik ugr hote hai yaa alag dawaaon se pratirodhi rahe hai
 Similarly, HIV-2 virus is considered less virulent and HIV-1 less contagious, although HIV-2 is also considered to be the cause of AIDS
 echivi -1 vishaanu aam or sarvaadhik rogajanak he
 It is further grouped into two or more ordinary groups
 prayek samooh ke bare main mana jaataa he ki vah maanav jaati main echivi ke swatantra prasar kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai

 2009 AD , a new type of HIV was found that was almost identical to the HIV virus found in wild gorillas at the same time
 yah chimpangiyon main paae jane vaale echivi se bhinn tha
 The virus was only detected as HIV-1 infection in a Cameroonian woman living in France in 2004 AD
 echivi -2 africa ke baahar vyapak rup se nahin dekha gaya he
 The virus was first detected in the United States in 1987
 2010 i
 tak echivi -2 tak se sambandhit kul 8 maamle saamne aae hai
 Of these, only a and b are epidemics
 echivi-2 mukhyatah pashchim africa se failaa he
 There are six subtypes of this which have been confirmed to be found in at least one person
 echivi-1 kaa upaprakaar e pashchim africa main aam he
 These subtypes are sometimes further subdivided into subtypes such as A1 and A2 or F1 and F2
 yah ek purna yaa antim suchi ke rup main nahin he or aage prakaar ke paae jane kii sambhaavna he
 Group a of HIV-2 has been found to be mainly spread across West Africa, as well as Angola, Mozambique, Brazil, India and, more generally, Europe and the Americas
 samooh bi mukhya rup se pashchim africa tak hi simit he
 HIV is still considered an incurable disease
 shodh chal rahe hai, haalanki abhi tak purnatah ilaaj viksit kar paane main safalataa nahin mil paayi he
 Currently some treatments are available for HIV patients in the market, which can partly help in reducing their suffering and making their life healthy, productive and longer
 echivi ke dushprabhav ko kam karne vaali evam rog pratirohak kshamta tantra ko majboot karne vaali anek aushadhiyaan hai
 They cannot eradicate the HIV virus but are helpful in keeping their patient alive for a longer period

 vidyutsakti ko janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak le janaa preshan kehalaata he
 In most places, electric power is produced away from its utilization sites
 vaise to janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak vidyutsakti ko le janaa hi preshan kehalaata he, parantu is shabd k vyaavhaarik arth bahudhaa duuri tathaa ucch boltata se sambandhit he
 The transmission lines are superimposed on poles or minarets, also as overhead lines and also as underground cables
 upree line saadharantaya taanbe ke taar kii hoti hai, parantu aluminium tathaa ispaat or aluminium ke sanyukt chaalak bhi vistrut rup se prayukt kiye jate hai
 In most places, electric power is produced away from its utilization sites
 janitrasthalon kii sthapana, vastut:, sadhano kii uplabdhi tathaa aarthik auchity ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 There is no question of making hydroelectricities in a specific place, because their location depends on natural resources which are usually far from densely populated areas
 tapiya bijligharon kii sthapana bhi bhaarakentre ke saath-saath koyale kii uplabdhi tathaa iske parivahan kii samasya par nirbhar karti he
 Hence, the distance of the generator places can be several hundred miles by weight and in such cases the power has to be carried by the transmission lines to the load
 atev preshan bhi vidyut udyog kaa utana hi mukhya or mahatvapurn ang he jitna swayan vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan
 While the transmission of electric power from the generator to the user site is called transmission, the practical meaning of the term is often related to distance and high bolt
 preshan line pole athwa minaaron par aropit, upree linon ke rup main bhi tathaa bhumigat cabilon ke rup main bhi hoti hai
 The upper lines are usually made of copper wire, but aluminum and steel and aluminum composite conductors are also widely used
 upree line bhumigat se kam se kam 20 foot kii oonchaai par honi chahie or inkaa koi bhi bhaag isse kam oonchaai par nahin hona chahie
 Their height from the ground is even higher in case of high voltage
 atev ye line polon par le jaai jaati hai or porcylen ke vidyutrodhiyon par aropit hoti hai
 The lines of thicker conductors, which transmit more power, are diverted to larger towers in place of poles, which are made of different shapes according to the driver number and the forces applied to them
 vidyutarodhi bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai or mukhyat: apni sthiti tathaa voltata ke anusaar vibhinn virgon ke hote hai
 Thus the insulators range from low voltage of 440 volts to 11 kilovolts, 33 kilovolts, 66 kilovolts, etc
 and are of an insulated shackle, pin, disc and suspension type depending on the condition used in different situations
 vidyutarodhi saadharantaya pole par kanchi main lage hote hai or is prakaar vinyasit hote hai ki kisi bhi dasha main chaalak jhulakar, duusare chaalak se, athwa pole, athwa uske kisi bhi sanrachana anshak se na chhu jaaen
 Their shape and composition are also such that under any circumstances, it is possible to maintain the conductor between the conductor and any structural fraction of the pole
 cabile, vastut:, kisi bhi vidyutarodhi chaalak ko kaha ja saktaa he, parantu vidyut ke preshan main prayukt honevaale cabile kaa upyog mukhyat: bhoomi ke andar hota he
 Therefore, the composition of cables is also such that they can be protected from the influences falling under the ground
 saamanyat: preshan cabile trikleey hote hai
 Therefore, there are at least three cores in them, which are electrically isolated and then they are also insulated from the top
 yah vidyutrodhi, saadharantaya, vyaapt kaagaj, athwa rui kii tepe kaa hota he, jo cabile kii kaaryakari voltata ke varg par nirbhar karata he
 The conductor core and dielectric lead are incorporated into the lead pipe, which does not allow moisture to enter, so that the insulator does not deteriorate
 is nalee ko yantric haani se bachaan ke liye jute kaa feeta diya jaataa he or upar se lohe kii pattee kaa kavach chadha diya jaataa
 For this reason, they are also called poetic cables
 ati ucch voltata preshan ke cabile, tel se bhare cabile bhi hote hai
 Oil is, in effect, the best dielectric medium
 parantu aise cabilon kii banaavat kaaphi jatil hoti he or inaki dekhbhaal bhi kathin hoti he
 Due to this their use is limited
 vidyutpreshan kii mitvyayita bahut seemaa tak chaalak ke aakaar par nirbhar karti he
 The size of the driver mainly depends on the carrying current
 kisi nirdhaarit shakti ke liye vahan kii janevaali dhara, mukhyat: voltata par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, it is only appropriate to use the highest voltage for transmission so that the current flowing through it can be reduced for that power and small size conductors can be used
 parantu ucchtam voltata kii bhi apni seemayen hai
 At voltages greater than 36 km, the size of the conductor depends not only on the magnitude of the current, but in fact, the effect of the korana
 corona ucch volttaaon par chaalak ke aasapaas kii vaayu ke ayanit hone kaa prabhaav hota he
 Due to this, the sound and brightness of Him Him is produced and it finally manifests as a power loss
 is kaaran chaalak ke aakaar kaa abhikalp is shakti haani tathaa uske prabhaavon ko drushti main rakhte hue karnaa hota he
 Interference of transmission lines at high voltages to communication lines is another important problem
 ucch voltata preshan karne vaali line samipsth sanchaar linon main ek vyatikaran voltata prerit kar detii hai, jiske kaaran sanchaar main gadabadi hoti he, par yah vyatikaran, sanchaar linon kii vidyut linon se dur rakhkar, kam kiya ja saktaa he tathaa duusare bhi bahut se upachaar kiye ja sakate hai
 The third difficulty is the proper structure of high voltage conductors and towers, so that faulty conditions do not arise
 saath hi saath unki uchit dekhbhaal bhi ek samasya ban jaati he
 In addition, power stability is a significant problem at the highest voltages
 ati ucch voltata kii lambii linon main, shaktipravaah, vastut:, shakti sthayitv dwaara simit hota he
 Because of this the rated power can only be transmitted to a specific distance at a specific voltage
 saath hi saath preshit shakti tathaa duuri ke anusaar ek vishisht voltata par preshan hi sabase adhik mitavyayi ho saktaa he
 These problems are very important in big plans and design of dispatch system is a major part of the plan
 preshnatantr kii yojana kaa aadhaar bhaar surveykshan hota he
 First the proposed load is calculated in different places and then according to them the position of the sub-centers is determined
 bhaar tathaa duuri ke anusaar preshan kii voltata tathaa paripath kii sankhya nishchit kii jaati he or prastaavit linon kaa path nishchit kiya jaataa he
 The form and design of line design, the type of insulation and the mechanism of their installation and protection mechanism is the most important economic aspect for any scheme
 preshnatantr kaa safal abhikalp bhi aarthik pahalu sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Successful design of a remittance system also depends on economic criteria
 kisi nirdhaarit shakti ke preshan ke teen mukhya sanghatak he : shakti, duuri tathaa voltata
 Successful design of any remittance scheme depends on the appropriate coordination of these three components
 line abhikalp kii disha main mahatvapurn shodh ho rahe hai, jinke parinamswaroop ab vidyutrodhon ke str ko utana unchaa nahin rakhaa jaataa jitna 10 varsh pehle rakhaa jaataa tha
 In this way huge savings in the value of lines have been possible
 atyucch voltata kaa preshan, saadharantaya, 100 mile se adhik kii duuri ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 Often dispatch has to be done in two order
 atyucch voltata par preshan saadharantaya bijlighar ke upakentre se upyogkshetra ke bhar centre ke nearesth upakedron tak kiya jaataa he, jahaan se kisi madhyam voltata par upyogsthal ke upakentre tak shakti kar preshan kiya jaataa he
 Thus it is called as primary and secondary dispatch
 antim upakentre se bhaar tak vitarak athwa sambharan line le jaai jaati hai, jahaan se vyaktigat bhaaron kaa sambharan kiya jaataa he
 To transmit the generated voltages normally, transforms to very high voltages
 atev parinamit bhi preshnatantr ke mahatvapurn ang hote hai
 In addition to this, many protection devices and circuit trots are also a specific part of the system
 parinamitra ke donon ore tel paripath trot kii vyavastha rahati he, jisase parinamitra ke donon ore kaa paripath kholaa ja sake
 Similarly, there is a provision to disable any line or its division, so that the line can be maintained in case of defect
 vastut: sangrakshan yuktiyaan dosha kii sthiti main doshi prabhag ko apane aap kholkar alag kar detii he
 Several types of relays are used in the sub-station for line protection
 based saamaanya riley atibhaar riley or bhoomi ksharan riley hai
 Overload relays, in the event of overload, open the circuit by introducing a circuit trotter and thus protect the line and its associated damage from overload damage or harmful effects
 bhoomi ksharan riley bhumidosh kii avasthaa main kaary karte hai or doshi line ko yojit kar dete hai
 There are many different types of relays used
 bahut se riley dosha kii duuri kaa vyavastha ke aadhaar par kaary karte hai or bahut se ek pilot taar kaa prayog karte hai, tathaapi aadhuniktam sangrakshan tantra karier sangrakshan tantra he
 The carrier is, in effect, a high-frequency wave, which is impeded on the pilot wires along with the power frequency
 dosha kii sthiti main usase sanyojit riley tatkshan kaary kar, line ko viyojit kar dete hai
 The carrier protection mechanism is more rapid and more reliable than other systems
 parantu yah keval ucch voltata linon ke liye hi aarthik rup se uchit ho saktaa he
 Provision of lightning protection is also very important in the design of transmission lines
 tadit line par girakar use tathaa usase sanyojit sabhi saajasja ko nasht kar sakati he
 To avoid this, many tips are used, mainly the provision of ground wires and lightning resistant
 bhoomi taar saamaanya rup se line ko tadit ke hanikaarak prabhaavon se bachaata he or tadit ko line par yathasambhav girane se roktaa he
 Lightning plugs are placed on the sub-center or end structures and when the lightning falls on the line, it is directly positioned, so as not to damage the line or decoration
 sabhi minar thik se bhooyojit hote hai or unka bhoomirodh vividh prakaar kii vyavasthaayen karke atyant kam rakhaa jaataa he
 From the point of view of preservation, more class dielectric also has to be used, but nowadays there is no need to keep the level of dielectric high due to research on lightning prevention
 preshantantron ko bahudhaa grid ke rup main antarbandhit kar dete hai, jisase grid ke andar shakti kaa swatantraapurvak pravaah ho sake
 Such grids operate at very high voltages and the voltage and frequency of the entire system is the same
 isamen niyantran kii kathinaaiyaan to avashya hi bad jaati hai, parantu tantra main kisi bhi sthaan kii phaltu shakti duusare sthanon par, jahaan uski aavashyaktaa ho, prayukt kii ja sakati he
 Thus, it is no longer necessary to keep additional installed power in power stations
 vastut:, bade gridon main kisi ek bijlighar, athwa mashin, kii shakti sampurna tantra kii shakti kii tulana main naganya hoti he or sampurna tantra ke kaary ko vishesh rup se prabhavit nahin kar paati
