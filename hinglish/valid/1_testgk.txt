 Ian Fleming went one step further and approached producer Sir Alexander Korda to produce a film adaptation of Live and Let Die or Moonraker
 haalanki corda ne shuru main dilchaspee dikhaai, lekin baad main peeche hat gaye
 On 1 October 1959, it was announced that Fleming would write an original film screenplay for Producer Kevin mcclory about Bond's character
 Jack Whitingham also worked on the script, which led to a screenplay titled James Bond, Secret Agent
 However, Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Burton refused to play the roles as director and hero respectively
 Meklory was unable to raise financing for the film and the deal was shattered
 fleming ne is kahani kaa istemaal apane upanyaas thanderbal ke liye kiya
 In 1959, producer Albert R
 Broccoli expressed interest in the adaptation of the Bond novels, but his colleague Irving Allen was not enthusiastic
 1961 main, broccoli ne phir harry saltzman ke saath bhagidaari kii or sabhi bond upanyaason ke film adhikaar ko fleming se kharid liya

 The winner of the competition was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had the quality of Gregory Peck, but proved unable to afford the role

 Broccoli and Fleming were convinced of Connery, but accepted it when he was rejected by Patrick mcguhan and dismissed Richard Johnson, James Mason, Rex Harrison, David Niven, Trevor Howard and Broccoli's friend Carrie Grant for him did
 jaisaa ki broccoli ne baad main kaha, "main ek damdaar aadmi chahta tha
 

and put a little bit of glee on that strong Scottish jism and you'll get Fleming's Bond instead of all the tantalizing gays being employed in this act "
 Already the bald Connery wore a wig in all of his Bond films
 conary ne kaha ki "aakhirkaar, vah charitra vastav main main nahin hum"

 The film was the second and final film starring Sylvia Trench, however, she was expected to be a regular bed partner between Bond's campaigns throughout the series

 By 1961, Fleming's Thunderball novel became the biggest hit in the Bond novel series and was the project that drew Cubby Broccoli back in 1961 to form Bond projects - most of which were owned by Harry Salzmann - but Thunderball was its The notable exception was that year, which was given a storyline that made it a screenwriter and the subject of a legal dispute by Fleming

 After You Only Live Twice and despite the posters promoting "sean Connery is James Bond", Connery announced that it was his last Bond film

 Shawn was then replaced by George Lazenbai, who starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service

 On Her Majesty's Secret Service, an effort was made to depict a continuity with previous Bond films that featured scenes from several previous Bond films during the title sequence
 iske alaava, jab bond apane daftar main apana saamaan pack kar rahaa hota he, to pichley maamalon ke kai smriti chihnon ko dikhaaya jaataa he, jaise ki thanderbal kaa shwaas upkaran, jabaki film ke prishth sangeet main un filmon kii dhunon ko bajaayaa jaataa he
 After Lezenbai turned down Diamonds Are Forever, the makers decided to revert to the Goldfinger formula

 Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover were considered for the next film in the series, Live and Let Die, and forty-five-year-old Roger Moore was selected

 Moore tried not to mimic his role as Sean Connery or Simon Templar in The Saint, and he played Bond in a more pleasing and humorous appearance

 One reviewer stated, "sean Connery doesn't have any seriousness in Roger Moore
 

 vah nirdeshak dwaara bond kii ghaatak hasya abhinayta ke rup main prastuti main daksh rup se baithta he"
 As part of the challenge to create his own version of Bond, Moore mixed some of the characteristics of his role in his series The Saint with Bond's personality
 aalochakon ko yah bond ek jaadugar adhik laga, adhik anugrahpurn, adhik vishleshnatmak or adhik beparwaah rup se or ek had tak nirlypt bhav se kaamuk laga
 He is physically as strong as Connery, but not as handsome in action

 moore kii duusari film da main wyeth da golden gan box offis par asafal rahi or broccoli ne thaan rakhaa tha ki ve ise chodenge nahin
 Roger Moore's third film, The Spy Who Loved Me, proved decisive for the series in two ways: it was the first film to be produced by Broccoli alone, as his half of the Bond film franchise due to a huge debt to Harry Saltzman in 1975 The share was forced to sell for twenty million pounds; And in that sense, it was also the first film to incorporate an entirely new story, as Ian Fleming only allowed the title of the novel to be used
 moore kii chauthi film, munarekar, bond kii aakhri film thi jiske liye fleming ke upanyaas kaa sheershak istemaal kiya gaya, lekin kaaphi baad main 2006 main kisino royaal ke sheershak kaa upyog kiya gaya
 The title was used from Bond's short story collection for the next two films, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy, and the story of both films incorporated various material from this collection
 film octopussi ko, fleming kii isi naam kii laghu katha kii agali kadi ke rup main padhaa ja saktaa he
 Moore showed interest in leaving the series after the 1981 film, For Your Eyes Only, after which many young actors began to give screen tests for the role, including James Brolin, Oliver Tobias and Michael Billington
 However, EON eventually persuaded him to make a comeback in the 1983 Octopussy, as the non-eon film Never Say Never Again was released the same year
 kyonki ve aavashyak ection or charitra kii maang ke hisaab se umrdaraj ho gaye the film main aksar hi stant dubles kaa istemaal kiya gaya or keval nazadik se dikhne vaale moore nishchit rup se moore hai
 Moore only regretted his last film, a View to Kill, which was rejected by critics

 12 years later, Dalton was approached again, presumably to replace Roger Moore in For Your Eyes Only, but the producers had no script and feared that he would be asked to do films like Spy Who Loved Me / Moonrecker Jaega ”which was not compatible with his concept of Bond films
 " dalton pratham abhinayta the jinhen da living delits kii peshkash kii gai thi, lekin shuru main unhen inkaar karnaa padaa kyonki shooting kii mul tareekhen unki brenda star film kii patibaddhtaon se takaraa rahi thim
 Pierce Broznan was then hired, but when his canceled television show Steel Remington was renewed in 1986, he could not progress

 Dalton, best known for his stage and television roles and trained in the British Shakespearean tradition, had a strikingly different Bond from his predecessors
 da gargian ne tippanee kii, "dalton main conary kii swaabhaavik garima nahin he or naa hi moore kaa satahi aakarshan, lekin vah lezenbai bhi nahin he

 In 1989, the year of Dalton's second and last appearance, MGM / UA was sold to Australian-based broadcasting group Quintex, which wanted to merge the company with Pathe

 Due to these legal disputes, this series had to go through a gap of six years
 However, EON began pre-production of another film in May 1990, which was to be released in late 1991
 "bond 17" ke liye aam prachaar saamagree kaa kareeb usee samay kans film samaaroh main anaavaran kiya gaya

 Due to legal disputes, the production of Dalton's third film was postponed several times
 1993 main ek saakshaatkaar main, timothy dalton ne kaha ki maaikel france film ke liye kahani likh rahe the, jiskaa nirmaan kaary 1994 main janvari yaa farvari main shuru hona tay tha
 It never started and Dalton resigned from the role in April 1994
 dalton ko pratisthapit karne ke liye, nirmaataaon ne piars broznan ko liya, jinase un logon kii mulaaqaat for yor aaiz onli ke set par hui thi, jab ve apni patni, casandra haris se milane aaye the, lekin unhen 1985 main roger moore kaa sthaan lene se roak diya gaya kyonki ve remington steel ke liye anubandh se bandhe the
 By then, the world had changed rapidly and Broznan had also gone through a period of change
 1987 main remington steel ke radd ho jane kuch hi samay baad, broznan kii patni ke cancer se peedit hone kaa pataa chalaa or unhone apni patni ke 1991 main nidhan tak dekhbhaal kii
 He worked only occasionally for the next three years, so by 1994 he was ready to play Bond
 unhone bond ke punarnirmaan ke liye apni aashaaen vyakt kii: "main dekhnaa chaahunga ki is aadmi ke bheetar kya he, use kya chiz prerit karti he, use koun ek hatyara banaata he

" Although Connery's Scottish background, Lesenbai's Australian background, or Timothy Dalton's Welsh ancestry were seldom noted in the past, some British fans thought it was strange to see Bond playing an Irishman
 broznan kaa bond cigar peetaa tha or vah italvi nirmit suut pasand karata tha
 More importantly, Broznan's goldeneye was the first film in the series to be produced after the disintegration of the Soviet Union
 isse yah andeh upajataa he ki kya bond aadhunik duniya main abhi bhi praasangik hai, kyonki pichhali kai filmon ne unhen soviet pratidwandviyon ke khilaaf khadaa kiya tha

 However, when it was released, the film was seen as a successful effort that effectively transformed the series into the 1990s
 is film ko conary kii yu onli liv twis ke baad se sarvaadhik sweekruti mili
 Tom Shone commented, "connery has no qualities in Broznan but has carefully guarded himself from Moore's faults

 British actor Colin Salmon, who played the role of Charles Robinson, who played MI6 in other Bond films with Pierce Broznan, was also considered for the role, and there was speculation that he would become the first black James Bond
 According to Martin Campbell, the only Henry Kavil was the only actor who was in serious competition for the role
 lekin us samay keval 22 saal ke hone ke kaaran, unhen is kirdaar ke liye bahut chota mana gaya
 In May 2005, Daniel Craig announced that Sony and MGM and producer Michael G
 Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, but by that time EON Productions had not approached him
 baad main, craig ne kaha ki nirmaataaon ne vastav main unhen bhoomika kii peshkash kii he, lekin unhone is prastaav ko tab tak ke liye thukraa diya jab tak ki unhen padhane ke liye script uplabdh nahin karai jaati
 Encouraged by the success of Universal Pictures rival Jason Bourne Franchise, MGM and EON decided to "bring Bond back to its original form" with the removal of his idiosyncrasies and irrelevant fictional elements that define the series Were engaged and it was decided to introduce a more strict, darker and more genuine Bond than any of its former film avatars May coincide with Ian Fleming's original novel Bond
 is prakaar, bond kii 21veen film kisino royaal, pehali film thi jo 1974 kii di main wyeth di golden gan ke baad se fleming ke kisi upanyaas kaa filmi roopantaran thi
 The franchise had to be a restructuring, setting a new timeline and narrative structure that was not part of any previous film
 This not only freed Bond Franchise from the continuity of the last forty years but also allowed the film to feature a less experienced and more delicate Bond
 ateet main jaisaa ki nae bondon ke parichay ke maamle main tha, is film ne nirmaan vistaar ko hataane kaa or mul tatwon par waapas lautne kaa avasar pradaan kiya
 As of August 2005, speculation was rife that 37-year-old Daniel Craig was being seriously considered, although the entire character selection for the role was not actually made until early September

 Unlike the pre-brozan period, Bond films have rarely reused directors since 1995 - the only exception being director Martin Campbell, who the producers called to direct Casino Royale after goldeni directed

 It was from the beginning of the Broznan period that directors outside Great Britain were used, but they were all from Commonwealth countries, only in 2008 Quantum of Solace was the first Bond film directed by a non-united Kingdom or Commonwealth director
 , By the german-swiss Mark Forster
 In the 1970s, Steven Spielberg wanted to direct a Bond film, but was rejected because he wanted a percentage of the profits not usually paid to the director of the Bond films

 In personality, Bond is rude, cruel, isolated and arrogant - one who speaks less and believes more in working

 Physically, Bond is athletic, beautiful, and quick-witted

 In appearance, he is stylish and well-dressed

 Moore's Bond is a bit humble and slightly more romantic than his predecessors or successors
 craig kaa bond thodaa adhik udasin or antarmukhi he, jabaki dalton kaa bond vishesh rup se kutil or krodhi he, jabaki usamen moore ke romantic gun bhi hai
 However, all bonds usually speak clever one-line dialogue under special circumstances
 ek premi ke rup main bond kaa kaushal filmon main acchhee tarah se sthapit he
 The series has bicameral dialogues in many places that refer to Bond's gender potential and length, and erotic things, especially when Bond is in Virgo's arms
 vah aksar aise "avasar nikaal letaa tha"
 uskaa yon kaushal aksar uske dushmano ko uskaa sahyogi bana detaa tha, jaisaa ki pussi gelor ke maamle main hua
 Some women managed to escape Bond's attraction to themselves, but in total more than fifty women have had sex with Bond so far, ranging from one woman to four women per film
 dainiel craig kii pehali do filmon ke apwaad ko chhodkar, har bond film main ek ek anukram hota tha jisamen bond miss manipeni ke saath sampark karata he, jo bond ke varisht, m kii vyaktigat assistant he
 Louise Maxwell played Miss Moneypenny alongside Connery, Moore and Lazenbai
 unke baad kairline bliss or samantha bond ne kramshah is bhoomika ko dalton or broznan ke saath nibhaayaa
 The trio certainly gave different dimensions to Moneypenny's personality, as did the six actors who played Bond
 a constant joke that runs throughout this film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and Bond's upward flirtation with her
 vah bhi uske saath ishk farmaati he or kabhi-kabhi vivaah ke ek prastaav or shaadi kii anguthi kii ummid main usase ruuth jaati he
 a fantasy scene in Die Another Day was the only occasion in the EON series that featured Moneypenny in a truly romantic embrace with Bond
 riboot film kisino royaal main is charitra ko hataa diya jaataa he, pehali bond film jisamen manipeni prastut nahin hoti he or naa hi yah charitra kwantum of soles main prakat hota he
 However, Casino Royale uses an indirect reference to Moneypenny during the scene when Bond meets Vesper Lind
 dow no main sthapit karte hue, kai filmon main m ke daftar main kot rack par bond kii topi ko oochaalnaa ek nae romaanchak maamle kii shuruuaat kaa sanket karata he
 There are various variations of this theme
 goldfinger main jab bond daftar se nikalataa he, to manipeni usase topi le leti he or bond ko rokane kii ummid se use khud uchhaalati he
 In Thunderball, he is distracted in the middle of a toss, when Moneypenny says he is late
 on har megestiz sikret sarvice main jab bond kii shaadi ho jaati he, to vah apni topi phenkata he, jise rudan karti manipeni pakad leti he
 In a View to Kill, Bond has a very new hat of moneypenny and he just goes to throw it and stop
 or munarekar main jab bond venice main hota he, vah ek khaali gondola main apni gondolier topi ko uchhaalata he
 This customary sequence is carried on a wardroom Hatrack in a submarine, even down in the U
 Only Liv Twice, where M, Moneypenny and Bond are all in the Uniform of the Navy
 bond ko shuruuaat main hi em se milane ke liye bulaayaa jaataa tha, jo britain kii gupt khufia seva ke / kii pramukh he, vah inke karyaalay main apana kaarybhaar lene aata he
 In many films, Bond takes over his office at a secret headquarters or office
 bond pravesh karata or vaishvik shanti ke liye nae khatre se em ko pareshaan pataa he
 m usually confides on his best agent but realizes the need to change Bond's risky ways and often preaches for his inconsiderate statement
 film main british sikret sarvice ke liye universal exportes kaa prayog ek cover naam ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It has been portrayed many times in movies such as a direction sign in Dr
 No, abbreviated "univx" in From Russia with Love, a brass name plate in Every Majesty's Secret Service, for Your Eyes Only in Bond's Helicopters, a building with signs in The Living Daylights, an identity card in The World Is Not Enough, a folder in Cassino Royale and a business card in Quantum of Solace
 Bond has also introduced himself as a Universal Export employee in You Only Live Twice, Octopussy, License to Kill, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day
 for yor ij onli main em kaa charitra dikhaai nahin detaa, kyonki haal hi main lambe samay se em kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale barnard lee kii mrityu ho gai thi

 Altogether three actors played the role of M: Bernard Lee for the Connery, Lezenbai, and early Moore films; Robert Brown for Moore's last two films and Dalton's two films; Judy Dench for all of Broznan's and Craig's films to date
 apana kaarybhaar milane ke baad, bond ko aksar takneekee jaankaree ke liye kyuu shakha bheja jaataa tha jisamen unhen apane mishan main istemaal karne ke liye vishesh upkaran saunpa jaataa tha

 Each of Bond's films Die Another Day is then given some sort of technical information that is usually given by M, Live and Let Die was the exception with q not shown and Bond himself giving his mission to m and Moneypenny Tells and on Her Majesty's Secret Service in which q does not give any type of information to 007 but refers to M
 kabhi-kabhi yuddh maidan main kyuu ko bond ke saath prishthbhumi main dikhaaya gaya he, uske saath ek portable kaaryshaala or unke karmchaariyon ko lete hue pradarshit kiya gaya he
 These workshops are set in unusual locations such as the Egyptian tomb in The Spy Who Loved Me and the monastery in South America at Moonraker
 q plays an active role in Bond's mission on two occasions, in Octopussy and License to Kill
 2006 ke casino royal ke saath riboot or baad main bani kwantum of soles main kyuu kii bhoomika ko manipeni kii tarah hi nikaal diya jaataa he or haalanki bond mishan ke liye upkaran praapt kar hi rahaa tha lekin koi takneekee jaankaree screen par dikhaai nahin de rahi thi
 Many continuous jokes are displayed in the laboratory
 goldfinger main bond dwaara upkarnon ke aksar kho jane nasht yaa kshatigrast ho jane ke kaaran kyuu kii rushtataa ko darshaya gaya he 
 ek anya yah bhi tha ki kaise itani aasaani se prayogshali main bond vichlit ho jaataa he jab kyuu upkarnon ke istemaal ke bare main vivaran ko jaldi jaldi bolne ke madhyam se bhuulawane kii koshish karata he jise bond kii smriti main aane kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Another joke is that Bond is happy with the response to the latest equipment and the angry response from the quartermasters
 Also there are short jokes that demonstrate the prototype device
 tathaapi, prishthbhumi main bond hameshaa vivaran ko yaad karata he or upkarnon kii purna aapurti se laabh letaa he

 Prior to at least half of the films, Pierce Broznan introduced Felix Leiter into the James Bond team
 Leiter also plays a small role in these films like the one he plays in the Fleming novel

 Also, Lezenbai's only Bond film does not have his appearance
 vah conary ke donon gaiyr ioen filmon nevar se nevar agen or praarambhik gaiyr-ioen televijan casino royal main clarence litre ke rup main dikhaai dete hai
 In the EON series, between 1973 and 1987 and between 1989 and 2006, Leiter has no role in films
 upanyaas main, litre ko ek shark kaat letaa he or vah apana dahinaa haath or baayan aadha pair shrunkhlaa main jaldi hi kho detaa he

 Lollat is the first scholar to explain the rasaka theory of Bharata
 rasnishpatti ke sabandh main inkaa swatantra mat sahityajagat main vikhyath hai
 He was an apostle and aphorist
 inke mat main shabd ke prayek arth kii pratipatti abhidha se thik usee tarah ho jaati he, jaise ek hi baan kavach ko bhedate hue sharir main ghuskar praanon ko pi jaataa he

 Professor Adam Smith first introduced the concept of free trade policy in his book Wealth of Nations
 unhone kaha ki bazaar kaa apana anushaasan hota he atah maang or purti ke niyam ke tahat bazaar ko kaary karne dena chahie
 Free trade refers to a system of trade policy that does not differentiate between domestic and foreign goods and neither foreign taxes are levied nor special commodities are given to domestic commodities
 mukt vyapaar kii niti ke samarthak iske paksh main anek tark prastut karte hai- Despite the above benefits of free trade, some economists believe that under certain circumstances, free trade can result in the loss of some industries
 swatantra vyapaar ke vipaksh main agralikhit tark prastut kiye ja sakate hai- Imperialism is almost finished in its traditional form, but it is still alive in one of its modern surroundings or with costumes

 ise nav-samrajyavad kaha jaataa he
 This is the modern form of imperialism
 is swaroop kii samaapti ab vikasshil deshon kii videsh nitiyon kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 According to Margentho, just as there are three types of imperialism under special circumstances and three types of imperialism according to their goals, similarly, three types of variations should also be established in the means of imperialist policies
 in sadhano ko mukhyatya sainik, aarthik tathaa saanskrithik samrajyavad ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 In fact, military imperialism targets military conquest, economic imperialism targets the economic exploitation of other people and cultural imperialism aims to remove one type of culture by another culture, but these all always serve as instruments of the same imperialism goal
 
 sainik samrajyavad samrajya nirmaan kaa sabase spasht, pracheen tathaa damankaaree tarika he
 Military imperialism tries to achieve its goal by direct military invasion
 aadhunik yug main hitler, musolini, nepolian, lui chaudaaven tathaa kai duusare shaskaon ne sainik vijay ke is saadhan kaa prayog kiya tha
 The advantage of this method from the point of view of an imperialist nation is that the new power relations that are established as a result of military conquest can be changed only by other war provoking by the defeated nation and the chances of success in this war are often from that defeated nation
 Is not as much as that of an imperialist nation
 saadharantah is bhaanti ke samrajya nirmaan main yuddh kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Alexander, Napoleon and Hitler all resorted to war in empire building
 yah thik he ki jahaan yuddh se samrajya kaa nirmaan hota he, to yuddh main paraajay se samrajya kaa vighatan bhi ho jaataa he, jaise- naaji germany ne apane samrajyavaadee lakshyon ke liye yuddh armbh kiya tha parantu is prakriya main usne apni shakti kho di tathaa yahaan tak ki vah duusari samrajyavaadee shaktiyon kaa swayan shikaar bhi ban gaya
 Using the best economic power to establish an empire over weak and poor nations is the most rational means of imperialism
 margentho ke shabdon main, "aarthik samrajyavad kam krurtapurna or saamanytah sainik pranali se kam prabhavakaari he tathaa ek tarksangat saadhan ke rup main shakti praapt karne kaa aadhunik yug kaa utpaadan he
 "the common features of the policy of economic imperialism are to gain economic control over other nations
 aarthik sadhano dwaara samrajyavaadee shakti duusare rashtron kii vitt vyavastha par niyantran karti he, jiske parinamswaroop nitiyon par niyantran ho jaataa he
 For example, the Central American Republics are all sovereign states, but to a large extent their economic life depends on imports from the United States
 isse sanyut rajya america dwaara in deshon par niyantran sambhav ho jaataa he
 These nations cannot continue to implement any policy, whether domestic policy or foreign policy, that the United States has objected to for a long time
 aarthik samrajya aaj ke is masini tathaa poonjivadi vistaar ke yug ke anuroop hi he
 The modern singular example of this is "dollar imperialism"
 "tel kootneeti" bhi aarthik samrajyavad kaa hi ek prakaar he
 Economic imperialism over the poorer nations of the rich and powerful nations Asia, Africa and Latin America, which in common parlance, is called the "third World" by means of foreign investment, subsidies, loans, multinational corporations, trade and technical monopolies and other such means

 Underdeveloped nations are politically independent and legally fully sovereign states, but in economic terms these states still depend on the rich developed states, which were traditional imperialist powers
 is raajnneetik rup se swatantra tathaa aarthik rup main nirbharta ko nav-samrajyavad tathaa nav upniveshwaad kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Economic imperialism is the main tool of neo-imperialism
 sainik samrajyavad, shakti sambandhon ko sainik vijay dwaara ulat-pulat kar rakh detaa he tathaa aarthik samrajyavad isaki prapti aarthik niyantran dwaara karata he
 Cultural imperialism tries to change the situation as it is and tries to reverse the power relations by controlling the human mind
 iskaa uddeshy apni samskruti kii shreshthata, vichaardhaara tathaa samrajyavaadee shakti kii jivan style se duusare rashtron ke vyaktiyon ke mastishk par niyantran he
 Cultural imperialism is a unique and subtle means of extending the power of the state through psychological means, by influencing others through the promotion and propagation of the superiority of culture and ideology of imperial power
 samrajyavad ke is saadhan main na to sainik shakti kaa prayog hota he, na aarthik dabaav kaa parantu samrajyavad ke lakshyon kii prapti kaa yah sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee tathaa sthaayee safal saadhan he
 Cultural control is over that section of society, which is the governance and policy-making leadership class of that country
 saadharantah saanskrithik samrajyavad sainik athwa aarthik samrajyavad ke sahaayak ke rup main aata he
 a prime modern example of this is the one used in Austria before World War II, while the Nazi government invited German forces to occupy the country

 When the United States promotes its literature extensively in countries in Asia and Africa, its main goal is the spread of cultural imperialism

 Its purpose is to destroy the self-respect of the people of other countries and fill the sense of slavery in them forever

 Democracy or public education is necessary in the fulfillment of public interest and noble cause, but it was not clear enough that they had a clear view
 desh ke shikshak, vidwaan or rakshak – nickspruhi, chatur or saahsee hone chahie
 The practice of advanced policy is the best in life and social behavior; However, it was his opinion that self-interest should be made by the ruling or financiers, if need be - Vajrakutil

 Being a memorial, it will be necessary to try to give proper justice and reference to some of the compositions according to the time and situation; Otherwise it is very possible to use the statement of Acharya
 astu
 1
 Just as gem is not found on all mountains, pearl is not produced in the head of all elephants, sandalwood tree is not present in all forests, similarly gentle men are not found in all places
 2
 jhooth bolnaa, utavlaapan dikhaanaa, dussahas karnaa, chal-kapat karnaa, moorkhtapurna kaary karnaa, lobh karnaa, apavitrataa or nirdayata - ye sabhi striyon ke swaabhaavik dosha hai
 Chanakya considers the above mentioned doshas as natural qualities of women
 haalaanki vartmaan daur kii shikshit striyon main in dosha kaa hona sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 3
 The availability of good substances for food, the power to digest them, the work force for contact with a beautiful woman, the desire to give abundant wealth as well as wealth
 ye sabhi sukh manushya ko bahut kathinata se praapt hote hai
 4
 Chanakya says that the person whose son is under his control, whose wife conducts according to the command and the person who is fully satisfied with his earned money
 aise manushya ke liye yah sansar hi swarg ke samaan he
 5
 Chanakya believes that the same householder is happy, whose children obey their orders
 pita kaa bhi karttavya he ki vah putron kaa paalan-poshan acchhee tarah se kare
 In the same way, such a person cannot be called a friend, who cannot be trusted and such a wife is meaningless who does not get any kind of pleasure
 6
 jo mitra aapke saamne chikani-chupadi baaten karata ho or peeth peeche aapke kaary ko bigaad detaa ho, use tyaag dene main hi bhalaai he
 Chanakya says that he is like a pot that has milk on its top but has poison inside
 7
 chanakya kehete hai ki jo vyakti acha mitra nahin he us par to vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie, parantu iske saath hi achche mitra ke sambandh main bhi puraa vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki yadi vah naaraaz ho gaya to aapke saare bhed khol saktaa he
 Therefore, caution is very important
 8
 chanakya kaa maananaa he ki vyakti ko kabhi apane man kaa bhed nahin kholana chahie
 Whatever work he has to do, keep it in his mind and he should complete it with full patience when the time comes
 9
 chanakya kaa kahana he ki morrkhtaa ke samaan yauvan bhi dukhadaayi hota he kyonki javaani main vyakti kamvasana ke aaveg main koi bhi moorkhtapurna kaary kar saktaa he
 But even more painful than these is to depend on others
 10
 chanakya kehete hai ki bachapan main santan ko jaisi shiksha di jaati he, unka vikaas usee prakaar hota he
 Therefore, it is the duty of the parents to lead them on such a path that they develop the best character because only the virtues of the family are enhanced by the virtuous ones
 11
 ve mata-pita apane bacchon ke liye shatru ke samaan hai, jinhone bacchon ko acchhee shiksha nahin di
 Because the illiterate child is insulted in the group of scholars in the same way as the heron in the herd of swans
 shiksha viheen manushya bina punch ke jaanavar jaisaa hota he, isliye mata-pita kaa kartavya he ki ve bacchon ko aisi shiksha den jisase ve samaaj ko sushobhit karen
 12
 Chanakya says that many pampering in children leads to many defects
 isliye yadi ve koi galat kaam karte hai to use nazarandaaj karke laad-pyaar karnaa uchit nahin he
 It is also necessary to scold the child
 13
 shiksha or adhyayan kii mahatta bataate hue chanakya kehete hai ki manushya kaa janm bahut saubhaahgya se miltaa he, isliye hamen apane adhikadhik samay kaa vedadi shastron ke adhyayan main tathaa daan jaise achche kaaryon main hi sadupyog karnaa chahie
 14
 Just as the grief of the wife's separation, the sorrow of the insult received from her siblings is unbearable, similarly the debt-ridden person remains unhappy at all times
 dusht raja kii seva main rahane vaala naukar bhi dukhi rahata he
 Man can never forget the curse of poverty
 inase vyakti kii aatma andar hi andar jalati rahati he
 15
 According to Chanakya, the life of the trees situated on the banks of the river is uncertain, because the rivers devastate the trees along the banks at the time of flood
 isi prakaar duusare ke gharon main rahane vaali stri bhi kisi samay patan ke maarg par ja sakati he
 Similarly, a king who does not have a minister to give good advice, he cannot remain safe for a long time
 isamen jaraa bhi andeh nahin karnaa chahie
 16
 Chanakya says that the way the prostitute turns away from the man at the end of the money
 usee tarah jab raja shaktiheen ho jaataa he to praja uskaa saath chhod detii he
 Similarly, birds living on trees also live on a tree as long as they get fruits from there
 atithi kaa jab puraa swaagat-satkar kar diya jaataa he to vah bhi us ghar ko chhod detaa he
 17
 The man who befriends a person with bad character, causing harm to others and living in an unclean place, is soon destroyed
 acharya chanakya kaa kahana he manushya ko kusangati se bachanaa chahie
 They say that it is in the good of man to leave the wicked person as soon as possible
 18
 chanakya kehete hai ki mitrataa, barabari vaale vyaktiyon main hi karnaa thik rahata he
 Government jobs are the best and for good business it is necessary to be efficient
 isi tarah sundar va susheel stri ghar main hi shobhaa detii he
 Chanakya used to live in a hut in the jungle
 vahaan anek log unase paraamarsh or gyaan praapt karne ke liye aate the
 The forest in which he lived was full of stones and thorn bushes
 chunki us samay praaia: nange pair rahane kaa hi chalan tha, isliye unke nivas tak pahunchane main logon ko anek kashton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 On reaching there, the feet of the people used to bled
 ek din kuch log us maarg se behad pareshaaniyon kaa saamana kar chanakya tak pahunche
 One person said while pleading with them, 'we were very sorry to reach you
 aap maharaj se kahkar yahaan kii jameen ko chamade se dhakwane kii vyavastha kara den
 This will make people comfortable
 ’ uski baat sunakar chanakya muskaraate hue bole, ‘mahashay, keval yaheen chamada bichaane se samasya hal nahin hogi
 The thorny and rocky paths are countless in this world
 aise main puure vishwa main chamada bichawana to asambhav he
 Yes, if you protect your feet with leather, then you can definitely avoid the wrath of stony paths and thorny bushes
 ’ vah vyakti sir jhukaakar bolaa, ‘haa guruji, main ab aisa hi karuunga
 ' iske baad chanakya bole, ‘dekho, meri is baat ke peeche bhi gaharaa saar he
 Instead of trying to improve others, improve yourself
 isse tum apane kaary main vijay avashya hasil kar loge
 The person who advises the world is unable to do anything, while his self-follower reaches the heights of success
 ’ is baat se sabhi sahamat ho gaye Amatya Acharya Chanakya of Pataliputra, being a very scholarly justiceist, was also a straightforward honest gentleman
 ve itane bade samrajya ke mahaamantri hone ke baavjood chappar se dhaki kutiyaa main rahete the
 He had a living like a common man
 ek baar yunaan kaa rajdoot unase milane raaj darbar main pahunchaa raajnneeti or kutanay main daksh chanakya kii charchaa sunakar rajdoot mantrmugdh ho gaya
 The ambassador asked for an appointment with Chanakya in the evening
 acharya ne kaha-aap raat ko mere ghar aa sakate hai
 The Ambassador was pleased with Chanakya's behavior
 shaam ko jab vah rajmahal parisar main ’amatya nivas‘ ke bare main poochne laga
 Raj Prahari said - Acharya Chanakya lives outside the city
 rajdoot ne sochaa shaayad mahaamantri kaa nagar ke baahar sarovar par bana sundar mahal hoga
 The ambassador arrived outside the city
 ek naagarik se poocha ki chanakya kaha rahete hai
 Pointing towards a hut, the citizen said - See, she is the hut of the General Secretary
 rajdoot aashcharya chakit rah gaya
 After reaching the hut, he touched Chanakya's feet and complained - a shrewd general minister like you lives in a hut
 chanakya ne kaha-agar main janata kii kadi mehnat or paseene kii kamai se bane mehalon se rahoonga to mere desh ke naagarik ko kutiyaa bhi naseeb nahin hogi
 The Greek ambassador bowed down on Chanakya's honesty

 Lev Tolstoy is one of the most respected writers of the nineteenth century
 unka janm rus ke ek sampann parivaar main hua tha
 He enlisted in the Russian Army and participated in the Crimean War, but left the army the following year

 His health did not support him for long
 aakhirkaar 20 navambar 1910 ko astapava naamak ek chote se railway stesan par is dhanik putr ne ek garib, niraashrith, biimaar vruddh ke rup main maut kaa aalingan kar liya
 Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy was born in Yasnaya Polyana, a princely state about 100 miles south of Moscow
 inaki mata pita kaa dehanth inke bachapan main hi ho gaya tha, at: laalan paalan inaki chachee tatyanaa ne kiya
 There were well-known scholars appointed to initiate their education in the form of upper class talukdars

 Aunt Tatyana wanted to make them ideal talukdars and for this purpose, used to incite a woman of the then elite society to make love

 But Tolstoy's conscience did not think it appropriate
 apni diary main unhone isaki spasht bhartsana kii he
 In 1844, Tolstoy entered Kazan University and by 1847 he studied the languages and legal disciplines
 riyasat ke bantwaare kaa prashn upasthit ho jane ke kaaran snaatak hue bina hi inhe vishvavidhyalay chhod dena padaa
 After coming to the princely state, he made efforts to improve the condition of his peasants and conveniently presented certain conditions for them to become independent landlords, but the Assamese class was influenced by rumors of imminent independence, so they rejected the terms of Tolstoy
 par yah afvaah afvaah hi rahi or antat: krishakon ko pashchaatap karnaa hi haath laga
 His story "A Land Owners Mornig" is based on this incident
 1851 main tollstoy kuch samay ke liye sena main bhi pravisht hue the
 He was appointed in the long-term battle with the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, where he used to spend his leisure time reading and writing
 yaheen par unki pratham rachana childehud 1852 main nirmit hui jo el0 tii0 ke naam se "ti contemporeri" naamak patr main prakashit hui
 Even in that romantic era, the creation of this monotonously realistic manner attracted people and there was a lot of speculation about the name of its creator at that time
 1854 main tollstoy danyube ke morche par bheje gaye; vahaan se apni badali unhone sebastopol main kara lee jo krimian yuddh kaa sabase tagada morcha tha
 Here he got ample opportunity to examine the war and the operators of the war closely

 This resulted in his creation "sebastopol Sketches"

 In 1855, he traveled to Petersburg where he was respected by the literary writers
 1857 ore 1860-61 main inhone pashchimi europe ke vibhinn deshon kaa paryaton kiya
 The main purpose of the latter tourism was to get information about the composition and activities of the objective educators and charitable institutions
 isi yatra main unhe yakshma se peedit apane bade bhai kii mrityu dekhne ko mili
 The death of Yakshmakrantha Bhai, the interminable torture, had a miraculous effect on Tolstoy
 yuddh or shanti, aanna karenina or evan ilich kii mrityu main mrityu ke jo atyant maarmik chithran milte hai, unka aadhaar uparyukt ghatana hi rahi he
 After returning from the yatra, he opened a school in his village Yasnaya Polyana for the children of farmers
 is vidhyalay kii shiksha paddati badi pragatisheel thi
 In this, the present test system and the system of passing failed on its basis was not kept
 vidhyalay bada safal rahaa jiskaa mukhya kaaran tollstoy kii netritv shakti or uske prati hardik lagan thi
 On behalf of the school, a magazine called "yasnaya Polyana" was also released in the name of the village, in which Tolstoy's articles published expresses very pithy views on various problems of the school and its students

 From 1863 to 1869, Tolstoy's time was spent in the creation of "war and Peace" and from 1873 to 76 in the creation of "anna Carrena"
 in donon rachanaaon ne tollstoy kii saahitiyik khyaati ko bahut unchaa uthaaya
 He was particularly aware of the secret of human life and its philosophy

 But in the end he won it

 Its revolutionary ideas are such that due to which it was not allowed to publish in Russia and the book was published in Switzerland
 is samay kii unki anya kai rachanaayen isi koti kii hai or ve sab switsraland main chhapi hai
 In the period from 1878 to 1885, Tolstoy remained inactive in terms of creating literary literature
 unki antarvruti maanav jivan ke rahasy kii khoj main uljhi rahi
 All of Ambakat's compositions began to seem futile to him
 par 1886 main ve pun: ucchkoti ke siddhhast upanyaas lekhak ke rup main saamne aae or isi varsh unki mahaan upanyasik rachana '"evan ilich kii mrityu"' prakashit hui
 The whole world had become enlightened by their ethos of faith and the recognition of Yasnaya Polyana Village had become famous as an excellent pilgrimage center
 hamaare rashtrapita mahatma gandhi is samay yuvak the
 It was during these days that he read Tolstoy's compositions and was attracted to them
 19veen shatabdi kaa ant hote hote daridron or asaaayon ke prati tollstoy kii sevavruti yahan tak badi ki unhone apni rachanaaon se rus desh main honevaali apnin samast aay daan kar di
 He allowed his wife to take only the amount that was necessary for the whole family's nutrition
 'punarutthan' naamak apane upanyaas kii samast aay unhone rus kii shantivaadee jati dukhebor logon ko rus kaa parityag kar canada main ja basane ke liye de di
 Suddenly in 1910, he decided to abandon his ancestral village "yasnaya Polyana" forever
 10 navambar 1910 ko apni putree eleclandra ke saath unhonen prasthaan kiya, par 22 navbanr 1910 ko maarg ke stesan astapovo main aksmaat fefde main dah hone se vahiin unka sharirant ho gaya
 His religion was very liberal and comprehensive
 tatkaaleen isai dharm ke prati unki spashtat: virdohi bhaavana thi
 From his thoughts he seems to be a kind of omnipotentist
 mrityu ko ve sharir kii antim ore avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered man as the ultimate and inevitable culmination of the body
 manushya ke sampark main aanevaali prayek vastu ko upyogita ke maandand se aankana ve uchit samajhate the or isi kaaran jivan kii soddeshyata ke prati ve sarvada jigyaasu bane rahe
 They considered a purposeless, thoughtless and autistic life as a kind of sin; Even he considered sexual intercourse only for the purpose of procreation
 manovaigyanik rachanaaon main fyodor dostoyevski hi tolastay ke samakaksh thaharte hai
 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he

 jwalamukhi visheshgyon ne jwalamukhi-visphoton ke anek prakaaron kaa varnan kiya he
 They are often named after famous volcanoes in which similar behavior was observed
 kai prakaar ke jwalamukheey visphot-jiske dauraan lava, tephra, or mishrit gaison ko jwalamukheey vent yaa fisher se nishkasit kar diya jaataa he-jwalamukhividon dwaara pratishthit kiya gaya he
 They are often named after the famous volcano where that type of behavior has been observed
 kuch jwalamukhi gatividhi kii avadhi ke dauraan keval ek vishesh prakaar ke visphot kaa pradarshan kar sakate hai, jabaki anya ek visphotak shrunkhlaa main sabhi prakaar ke puure anukram pradarshit kar sakate hai
 There are three different types of explosions
 sabase acchhee tarah se manaaya jaataa he megmatic visphot, jisamen megma ke bheetar gas kaa diconpressant shaamil hota he jo ise aage badhaata he
 Phreatomagmatic eruption is another type of volcanic eruption, which is induced by compression of gas within the magma, directing magmatic activity in direct contrast to the process
 teesraa visphotak prakaar agni visphot he, jo megma ke sampark ke madhyam se bhaap ke ati taap dwaara sanchalit hota he; in visphotak prakaar aksar maujuuda rock ke dane ke kaaran, koi bhi megmatic relies pradarshit nahin karte hai
 There are several subtypes within these broadly defined explosive types
 sabase kamjor hawaiyan or pandubbi hai, phir stromboliyan, iske baad valkanian or suratsian
 Strong explosive types are pellen explosions, followed by Plinian explosions; The strongest explosions are called "ultra-plinian"
 Subglacial or phreatic visphot unke visphotak tantra dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he, or takat main bhinnata he
 An important measure of explosive strength is the Volcanic Explosive Index, an order of magnitude scale from 0 to 8 that is often related to explosive types
 visphotak kii takat ko maapne ke liye jwalamukheey visphot suchakank 0 se 8 tak scale hota he
 It is used by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program in assessing the impact of historical and prehistoric lava flows
 yah bukamp ke liye richter scale ke samaan tareeke se sanchalit hota he, jisamen mulya main prayek antaraal pariman main das guna badhata he 
 The vast majority of volcanic eruptions are between 0 and 2 VEI
 megmatic visphot gas relies se visphotak diconpressant ke dauraan kishor samoohon kaa utpaadan karte hai
 They can range in size from relatively small lava to over 30 km high ultra-plinian eruption, larger than the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 burying Pompeii
 hawaiyan visphot jwalamukheey visphot kaa ek prakaar he, jiskaa naam hawaii jwalamukhi ke naam par rakhaa gaya he jiske saath yah visphotak naam ek prakaar hollmark he
 Hawaiian eruptions are the quietest type of volcanic event, characterized by an impressive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lava, with low gaseous content
 hawaiyan visphot se nikali saamagree kii maatra anya jwalamukhi prakaaron main nikali maatra se aadhe se kam he
 The production of stable amounts of lava produces a wide gradient and large volcanic mountain
 visphotak mukhya shikhar sthaan par kendrit nahin rahete, jaisaa ki anya jwalamukheey prakaaron ke saath hote hai, or aksar shikhar ke aas paas or centre se baahar nikalne vaale fisher vents se hote hai
 Hawaiian explosions often begin as a line, often known as a fire curtain, along the fisher vent
 These lavas begin to concentrate on some vents, vents
 mukh dwaar is bich, aksar bade lava fawwaare kaa rup lete hai, jo saikadon meter yaa usase adhik kii oonchaaiyon tak pahunch sakate hai
 Particles from lava fountains are usually cooled in the air before falling to the ground, resulting in the accumulation of fragments of cindery scoria; However, when the air is particularly thick with explosions, they cannot cool quickly enough due to the surrounding heat, and can still heat the ground, creating an accumulation cone
 yadi visphotak dar kaaphi adhik hai, to ve spatter-fed lava pravaah bhi bana sakate hai
 Hawaiian explosions often last very long; Puu'ao, a cinder cone of Kilauea, has been exploding continuously since 1983
 ek anya hawaiyan jwalamukheey visheshta sakriy lava jhiilon kaa nirmaan he, vartmaan main duniya main keval 6 aise jhil hai, or kilaua ke kupianaha vent unamem se ek he
 Vidur was one of the central characters of the Hindu text Mahabharata and Prime Minister of Hastinapur, Kaka of Kaurava and Pandavas and brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu
 unka janm ek daasi ke garbh se hua tha
 Vidur is also considered an incarnation of Dharmaraja
 hastinapur naresh shantanu or rani satyavati ke chitrangad or vichitraveery naamak do putr huye
 Shantanu died in the childhood of Chitrangad and Vichitravirya, so Bhishma was nurtured
 bhishma ne chitrangad ke bade hone par unhen rajgaddi par bitha diya lekin kuch hi kaal main gandharvon se yuddh karte huye chitrangad maaraa gaya
 At this Bhishma handed over the kingdom to his Anuj Vichitravirya
 ab bhishma ko vichitraveery ke vivaah kii chintaa hui
 At the same time, the three girls of Kashiraj, Amba, Ambika and Ambalaika were about to be swayamvara
 unke swayamvar main jaakar akele hi bhishma ne vahaan aaye samast raajaaon ko parrast kar diya or teenon kanyaon kaa haran kar ke hastinapur le aaye
 The elder girl Amba told Bhishma that she had given her body and mind to Raj Shalva
 uski baat sun kar bhishma ne use raja shalve ke paas bhijwa diya or ambika or ambalika kaa vivaah vichitraveery ke saath karvaa diya
 King Shalva did not accept Amba, so she returned to Hastinapur and said to Bhishma, "O Arya! You have brought me everything, so you marry me
" " kintu bhishma ne apni pratigya ke kaaran uske anurodh ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Amba was angry and went to Parashurama and told him about his agony and asked for help
 parashuram ne amba se kaha, "he devi! aap chintaa na karen, main aapkaa vivaah bhishma ke saath karwaaungaa
 "parashurama sent a call to Bhishma but Bhishma did not go to him
 is par krodhit hokar parashuram bhishma ke paas pahunche or donon veeron main bhayanak yuddh chhid gaya
 Both were unprecedented warriors, so the victory and victory could not be decided

 vichitraveery apni donon raniyon ke saath bhoga vilaas main rat ho gayi kintu donon hi raniyon se unki koi santaan nahin hui or ve kshay rog se peedit ho kar mrityu ko praapt ho gayi
 Now fearing total destruction, Mother Satyavati said to Bhishma one day, "son! To save this dynasty from being destroyed, my command is that you produce a son from these two queens
" " mata kii baat sun kar bhishma ne kaha, "mata! main apni pratigya kisi bhi sthiti main bhang nahin kar saktaa
 " yah sun kar mata satyavati ko atyant dukh hua
 Suddenly he remembered his son Ved Vyas
 samaran karte hi vedavyas vahaan upasthit ho gayi
 Satyavati looked at them and said, "O son, all your brothers have gone childless
 atah mere vansh ko naash hone se bachaane ke liye main tumhen ajna detii hoon ki tum unki patniyon se santaan utpann karo
 "ved Vyas obeyed and said," Mother! You should tell both those queens that they will follow the fast for one year only then they will conceive
 " ek varsh vyateet ho jane par vedavyas sabase pehle badi rani ambika ke paas gayi
 Ambika closed her eyes due to fear of his glory
 vedavyas laut kar mata se bole, "mata ambika kaa bada tejasvi putr hoga kintu netra band karne ke dosha ke kaaran vah andhaa hoga
 "satyavati was deeply saddened to hear this and sent Vedvyas to the younger queen Ambalika
 ambalika vedavyas ko dekh kar bhay se pili pad gai
 On returning from her chamber, Ved Vyas said to Satyavati, "mother! Ambalika will have a son suffering from Pandu disease from her womb
 " isse mata satyavati ko or bhi dukh hua or unhone badi rani ambika ko punah vedavyas ke paas jane kaa aadesh diya
 This time the elder queen did not go herself and sent her handmaid to Ved Vyas
 daasi ne anandpurvak vedavyas se bhoga karaayaa
 This time Ved Vyas came to Mother Satyavati and said, "mother! This maid's womb will produce a very strategic son who is well versed in veda-vedanta
" " itnaa kah kar vedavyas tapasya karne chale gayi
 When the time came, Dhritarashtra was born from Ambika's womb, Pandu who was suffering from Pandu disease from Ambalika's womb, and Dharmatma Vidur from Maid's womb were born

 Some of these classifications are: bhaavana or bhaavana ke parinaamon ke bich sambandhit antar mukhya vyavhaar or bhaavnaatmak abhivyakti he
 As a result of their emotional state, people often express a variety of expressions, such as crying, fighting or hating
 If someone expresses emotion without any related expression, then we can assume that expression is not required for feelings

 The functional approach to emotions, suggests that emotions have emerged as a result of a particular action to protect as a subject

 ek sthiti main jatil bhavanaaen, buniyadi bhaawanaaon ke saath judy saanskrithik sthiti yaa gathjod ke kaaran upaj sakati hai

 Some people also argue about the existence of meta emotions which are feelings about emotions
 vishisht bhaawanaaon kaa ek anya arth unke hone vaale samay se sambandhit he
 Some emotions are of a few seconds, while some may last for many years
 The latter can be considered as a long-term tendency in which there is only a feeling of attachment towards someone rather than a proper feeling
 There is a difference between emotional events and emotional dispositions

 Template: Emotion bhaawanaaon se sambandhit siddhant pracheen yunaan ke samay ke vichaaron ke saath plato or arestu ke samay main le jate hai
 We also find theories refined as the work of philosophers such as René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza and David Hume
 bhaawanaaon se sambandhit baad ke siddhant shodhon main unnati ke parinamswaroop praapt hue hai
 Most theories are not isolated and many researchers have incorporated different perspectives into their work
 bhaawanaaon ke daihik siddhant ke anusaar, sharir bhaawanaaon ke prati aavashyak nirnyon kii bajaae sidhe pratikriya karata he
 The first modern version of such theories was presented in 1880 by William James

 lidu or robert i

 William James, in an article 'what is an emotion?', Argued that most emotional experiences are caused by physical changes
 lagbhag isi samay danish manovaigyanik karl laing ne bhi miltaa julata siddhant pesh kiya, isliye ise james-laing siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 According to this theory and its facts, a change of circumstance leads to physical change
 jaise ki james kehete hai "shaareerik badlaav hone kii avadharana hi bhaavana he "
 james daawa karte hai ki "hamen udaasi anubhav hoti hai kyonki ham rote hai, ladaai ke samay krodhit hote hai, kaanpane ke kaaran darate hai or aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki, maafi maangate hue, krodh yaa dar ke samay ham na royen, na laden yaa na kaanpen
 This theory has been proved by experiments, in which the desired emotion is obtained by changing the conditions of the body
 is prakaar ke prayogon ko chiktsa main bhi prayukt kiya gaya he 
 james-laing ke siddhant ko aksar galat samajha jaataa he kyonki yah virodhabhasi he
 Most people believe that emotions promote emotion-related actions: such as "i'm crying because I'm depressed", or "I ran because I'm scared"
 In contrast, james-lang's theory emphasizes that we first react according to the situation, and after that we relate our actions to emotional response
 is prakaar se, bhavanaaen hamaari apni kriyaaon kii vyakhya karti hai tathaa inhen vyavasthit karti hai
 james-lang's theory is now rejected by most students
 tim dalgleish ke nimnlikhit kathan ke anusaar: The james-lang theory has remained influential
 Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity
 Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james-lang view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion
 " james-laing ke siddhant ke saath ek samasya yah he ki yah kriya ke parinaam par kendrit he, na ki bhaavnaatmak anubhavon se hone vaale shaareerik prabhaavon par
 
 From the information found in the mapping of the nerves of the brain structure, the neurobiological interpretation of human emotions is that emotion is a dear or unpleasant condition that arises in the breastmilk's brain
 yadi isaki sarisrupon se tulana kii jaye to bhaawanaaon kaa vikaas, saamaanya haddiyon vaale jantu kaa standhari ke rup main badalane ke samaan hoga, jinamein neurochemical main mastishk kii gatividhi ke str ke anusaar utaar-chadhaav aata he, jo ki sharir ke hilne dulne, manobhaavon tathaa mudraon main parilakshith hota he
 For example, the feeling of love is thought to be an expression of the palaeosurket of the mammalian brain, which leads to feelings of care, feeding, and beauty
 peleocircuit shaareerik bhaawanaaon ko tantrikaon dwaara pradarshit karne kaa madhyam he jo bolne ke liye bani cortical tantrika se lakhon varsh pehle bani thi
 In this, there is a network of nerve cells in the already formed pathway or the front of the brain, brain stem and spinal cord
 inkaa udbhav kriyaayein niyantrit karne ke liye stanadhariyon ke purvajon se bhi pehle hua he, lagbhag jabaderahit machhlee ke samay ke aas paas
 Before the mammalian brain developed, it is believed that the animals' lives were automatic, conscious and nappy

 With the arrival of nocturnal mammals, about 180 million years ago, odor replaced vision as an effective nerve and created more avenues for responding through the snoring nerve, which is believed to be Later on, mammals evolved into feelings and emotional memory
 In the Jurassic period, mammals successfully used their sniffing ability compared to reptiles - that's why the part of the mammary olfactory nerve of mammals is larger than that of reptiles
 ye gandh dhire dhire tantrikaon kaa khaakaa banaati gayin jisase aage chal kar hamaare mastishk kii sanrachana bani
 Emotions are believed to be related to the functioning of the area of the brain that instructs us, motivates our behavior and explains the importance of the events around us
 broka, pepez or maclin kii mahatvapurn khojein bataati hai ki bhavanaaen mastishk ke madhya main sanrachanaon ke samooh se judi hoti he, jise limbik system kehete hai, jisame hypothalamas, singulate cortex, hippocampi or anya sanrachanaayen shaamil hai
 Recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures, unlike others, are not directly related to emotions in that way, while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater importance
