 Flying carpets are usually thick carpets, often very designed and often made in the Middle Eastern parts, and magic is done to make the Jinpar fly
 Flying carpets were once an accepted means of travel for the British magical community, but are now banned because they have been declared as non-magical objects by registration of procured charmed objects
 Therefore, it is now against British Wizarding law to recite mantras on the carpet or fly them, although in other countries they are still legally valid
 Mr
 Weasley was heavily involved in bringing this process of legalization due to his office post related to misuse of non-magical items

 One person came to donate the carrying blood
 rakt ki jaanch karne par chikitsto kon pataa chalaa ki yah group to kisi or se match nahi hota
 The lab's head doctor Sanmukh Joshi and his team started his investigation
 doctor joshi ne international blad group reference leboratory se sampark kiya
 Where blood was investigated but no blood group was found
 yah blad sample world health organijeshan bheja gaya
 Where the WHO Laboratory has certified this new blood group after a thorough examination
 doctor sanmukh joshi kaa kahana he ki unhonen is blad group ko INRA naam diya he
 Which is derived from the first two words India and the latter two from the name of the woman giving blood

 When the blood group was examined, the doctors found that this unique blood group did not match any other sample
 phir unhone ise INRO naam de diya
 This blood sample has also been investigated by WHO
 iske baad lab ne apni jaanch ke baad is baat ko sweekruti di he ki yah blad group puri duniya main iklauta he
 In such a situation, a person has a lot of trouble due to having such a unique blood group
 wo na kisi ko apana khun de saktaa he or naa hi le saktaa he
 If he ever has any operation, doctors will have to take his blood first
 yah bhi man gaya he ki puri duniya main aise sirf 7 log hai jinka khun kisi se bhi match nahin hota
 And this is India's second success in finding a unique blood group
 isse pehle bharat ne bombai blad group bhi khoja gaya tha

 This practice was abolished after India became independent
 bharat kii pracheen vichaardhaara ke anusaar bhoomi saarvajanik sampatti thi, isaliye yah vyakti kii sampatti nahin ho sakati thi
 Land, like air, water and light, was considered a gift of nature
 maharishi jaimini ke matanusaar "raja bhoomi kaa samarpan nahin kar saktaa tha kyonki yah uski sampatti nahin varan maanav samaaj kii sammilit sampatti he
 That is why everyone has equal rights over it "
 manu kaa bhi spasht kathan he ki "rishiyon ke matanusaar bhumiswamitv kaa pratham adhikaar use he jisane jangal katkar use saaf kiya tha jota" 
 Therefore, in a very large part of ancient India, the head of the village was elected by the village community and he was appointed with the consent of the state
 rajya use bhoomikar na dene par hataa saktaa tha, yadhyapi yah pad vanshanugat tha tathaa isaki prapti ke liye janamat tathaa rajyasweekruti aavashyak thi
 Therefore, those who are not elected were different from present-day landlords
 pracheen bharat main bhoomi kaa sampatti ke rup main krayvikray sambhav nahin tha
 This fact has also been confirmed by Western scholars Baden Powell and Sir George Campbell
 campbell kaa kathan he ki bhoomi jotane kaa adhikaar ek adhikaar maatr hi tha or hindu vyavastha ke anusaar bhoomi nahin mana gaya tha
 It has been known by modern research that in ancient India, there were feudatories, overheads, bhogikas, Pratiharas and Dandanayaks
 ye log newnaadhik samantpratha ke anukool the
 But we have not been sure about their rights and duties, except that these people used to send troops to their owners when needed
 in adhikariyon ko paarishramik ke rup main bhoomi pradaan kii jaati thi
 According to Yajnavalkya regarding the land system, there were four classes, Mahipati, Kshetraswami, Krishak and Shikami
 acharya brihaspati ne kshetraswami ke sthaan main keval swami shabd kaa hi prayog kiya he parantu iskaa spashtikaran kar diya he ki swami, raja or khetihar ke madhya kaa varg tha
 The above description only indicates the classification of land holdings, and not to bring the farmer to the level of an Anglo slave
 mukhya prashn to yah he ki bhoomi par swatv adhikaar kisko - rajya ko, krishak ko athwa kisi madhyavarti varg ko vidwaanon ke matanusaar pracheen bharat main yah adhikaar hi tha jo swatv adhikaar nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We do not find any transformation in this ancient land during Yavana rule and neither is there any change in the basic principles of land-rights
 yavan shaasha bhoomikar gaanv ke mukhiya dwaara hi vasuul karte the or kabhi-kabhi sthaneey saradaaron vaa raajaaon dwaara, jo apana str gaanv ke mukhiya se unchaa hone kaa daawa karte the
 The claim of these kings appears to have produced an intermediate class between the state and the cultivator
 parantu samantvaad pad avrodh sthaayee rakhaa gaya tha kyonki rajya sarvada in raajaaon ko karmchaaree hi maanate the
 Although these kings were beginning to be hereditary, the state always had the right to grant and take back their post
 ek raja ke uttaradhikari ko raja kii sanad praapt karne ke liye prarthanapatr dena padataa tha or sanad kii prapti ke pashchaat hi vah raja hota tha
 In the Ainacabari, no intermediate class is recognized between the farmer and the state
 tathakthith raja or jameendaar saidhantik or vaastavik rup main keval kar vasuul karanevaale karmchaaree hi the
 It is notable that the Yavana rulers never claimed land-ownership-rights
 yah baat in aitihaasik tathyon se spasht he ki aurangzeb ne hundi, palam tathaa anya sthanon par krishakon se bhoomi kharidi thi, jaisaa akbar ne akbarabad or elahabaad main kile banane ke liye kiya tha
 Shah Jahan also did the same, it is proved from the above evidence that the Yavana rulers believed in property rights only in collecting taxes and not in the land
 unke shasankaal main krishak ke adhikaron ko ucchtam manyata di gai thi
 The farmer used to give it by the king and the head of the village and the king and the chief received remuneration for this work by the state
 san 1707 i0 main aurangzeb kii mrityu ke pashchaat krishakon ke adhikaron kaa lop dhire-dhire aarambh hua jab ki kendriya satta shithil padane lagi
 The sentiment of semi-feudal selfishness emerged during this time of monopoly
 jab rajya kii satta shithil padane lagi, rajya ke karmchaaree praja ke janmaal kii raksha karne main asamarth hone lage
 As a result, the villagers began to take the help of powerful employees and kings or chiefs for the protection
 in logon ne swabhaavat: sharnaarthi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron par akraman kiya
 Under these conditions, seedlings of Zamindari system are found
 parantu is sankatkaal main bhi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron kaa purna samarpan nahin hua tha
 Zamindari system started to emerge from the arrival of British in India
 angrej shaskaon kaa vishwaas tha ki ve bhoomi ke swami hai or krishak unki praja hai isaliye unhone sthaayee tathaa asthaayee bandobast bade krishakon tathaa raajaaon or jameendaaron se kiye
 Although impressed by the political rationale, he leased one pargana to the monopolist who collected every tax for five years
 is prakaar jameendaari pratha ko angrajon ne manyata pradaan kii yadhyapi aarambh main unka vichaar krishakon ko unke adhikaron se vanchit karne kaa nahin tha san 1786 i0 main lard corn walis, warren hestigaj ke baad, garvanar general hua
 Lord Cornwallis was also in favor of Zamindari system
 usne san 1791 i0 bengal, bihar tathaa urisa main das varshiya bandobast kii ajna di
 Two years later, the Board of Directors gave permission to make this ten-year plan a permanent settlement
 madras main jameendaari pratha kaa udai angrej shaskaon kii nilaam niti dwaara hua
 The lands of the villages were divided and auctioned and sold to the highest payer
 prarambh main avadh main bandobast krishak se hi kiya gaya tha parantu tadnantar raajnneetik kaarnon se yah bandobast jameendaaron se kiya gaya
 In the settlement report of the great historian Sir Vincent A
 Smith, Aligarh, it clearly acknowledges that the settlements were made to the monopolies, aiming only at utility, ignoring the prevailing land rights
 anyaaypurna karrashi ikattha karne kaa yah sabase saral upaay he tathaa yah raajnneeti ke drushtikon se bhi upyogi he kyonki iske falswaroop sarkaar kaa ek shaktishaalee tathaa dhani varg kii sahaayta milti rahegi
 Thus in the history of India for the first time these settlements established the class of landlords between the state and the farmers by the policy of the British, which resulted in the loss of the property rights of the farmers who had been in existence since time immemorial
 yah madhyavarti varg din prati din dhani hota gaya kyonki angrej shaasha apni karrashi main se adhik se adhik hissaa unhen pralobhan ke rup main dete rahe
 In these settlements, no attention was paid to the interests of the farmers, as a result of which their grief, humiliation and humiliation increased day by day
 kai baar angrej shaskaon ne bhi is ore dhyaan dilaayaa ki krishakon kii bhudhruti kii raksha kii jaay evam unka lagaan bandobast ke samay tak nirdhaarit kar diya jaay
 Still nothing was done
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej shaskaon kii dharna thi ki jameendaaron ke saath vyavhaar main udaartaa dikhaane par jab ve sampann evam santusht rahenge to ve apane asamiyon ko nahin sataayenge jiske falswaroop ve bhi khushhaal rahenge
 But this was his great mistake because the landlords always betrayed their duty
 at: angrej shaasha yah mahasoos karne lage ki is bhul kaa sudhaar kiya jaae
 As a result, they arranged land related legislation to improve the condition of the farmers
 yah kadam jameendaari pratha ke ast kii disha main pratham charan kaha ja saktaa he
 In this first phase, which lasted from 1859 AD to 1929 AD, the laws that were enacted imposed certain restrictions on the rights of landlords to increase the rent and also benefited the higher class farmers
 kintu in kanoonon kaa mukhya uddeshy jameendaaron ko lagaan vasuul karne main sahuuliyat dene kaa tha jisase ve rajya ko rajasav thik samay par de saken
 In 1859 AD, the first land related act was passed
 yah adhinium samast british bharat ke liye ek adarsh bhoomi-adhinium tha jiske anuroop adhinium bharat ke sabhi bhaagon main paas hue or samay samay par unamem sanshodhan bhi kiye gaye taaki asantusht krishakon ko shant kiya ja sake
 But the landlords still continued to squeeze the peasants to recover their just and unjust taxes, which caused widespread dissatisfaction and restlessness among the farmers
 jameendaari pratha ke ast ke kram main doosraa charan san 1930 i0 se 1944 i0 tak rahaa
 During this time, peasant movements started happening all over the country
 in andolanon kaa beej ek kisaan sabha ne boyaa tha jo akhil bhartiya congress kii elahabaad baithak main taarikh 11 farvari san 1918 i0 ko hui thi
 After that the Congress started to advance the interests of the farmers
 parinaam swaroop gramin janata main kaaphi jagrati paidaa ho gai
 Pt
 Jawaharlal Neh degree announced in the U
P
 Congress Committee on 27 October 1928 that political freedom is meaningless till the farmers get freedom from exploitation
 shanai: shanai: kisaanon kii jaagrukta badi or saath hi saath unki vyakulata bhi
 The peasant class became more vocal and demanded the stability of land holdings and reduction in revenue
 kisaan andolanon se prabhavit hokar raiyyatwarikshetron main nae adhinium banaae gaye jinase krishakon ke hiton kii raksha ho sake
 The Malabar Tenancy Act is a landmark in this regard
 iske baad bhopal land revenue act, 1935 tathaa assam tenency act 1935 paas hue
 Under the Government of India Act, 1935, when the 'special Autonomy' was inaugurated, the Provincial Governments arranged Land Reforms Acts which gave more rights to the farmers and curtailed the rights of the landlords
 you0 pi0 tenency act, 1939, tathaa bombai tenency act, 1939 vishisht udhaaharan aise vyapak adhiniyamon ke hai jinke dwaara krishakon ko maurusi adhikaar die gaye evam krishakon ke hit main jameendaaron ke katipay adhikaar chin liye gaye
 Even after the enactment of these Land Reforms Acts, the evils of the Zamindari system existed, although the Zamindars were paralyzed to a large extent
 in jameendaaron ko neh degree ji ‘british sarkaar kii atilaalit santan ’ kaha karte the
 He was a symbol of the past feudalistic practice which was completely contrary to modern conditions
 isliye indian neshnal congress ne kai baar is baat kii ghoshnaa kii ki jameendaari unmoolan ko congress ke kaarykram main pramukh sthaan dena chahie
 a farmer conference date was held on 27, 28 April 1935 in Allahabad under the chairmanship of Sardar Patel
 usne jameendaari unmoolan ko prastaav paas karke is ore ek pramukh kadam uthaaya is prastaav main yah ghoshnaa kii gai thi ki ‘gramakalyaan ke drushtikon se vartmaan jameendaari pratha bilkul vipareet he
 This practice was brought in the arrival of British rule and rural life has been completely destroyed by this'
 parantu san 1939 i0 main dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru ho jane ke kaaran bhoomi sudhaar kaa sara kaarykram ruuk gaya
 After the end of the war, the last phase of the end of Zamindari system started which lasted from 1945 to 1955
 yuddh samaapt hote hi british sarkaar ne 1945 i0 main government of india act 1935 i0 ke antargat prantiy sadanon ke chunaav karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Congress decided to participate in the elections and in December 1945 took out the election manifesto
 is ghoshnaptr main jameendaari unmoolan ke vishay main spashtatya kaha gaya ki ‘bhoomi vyavastha kaa sudhaar, jisaki bharat main ati aavashyaktaa he, krishakon tathaa rajyake bich madhyavarti varg ko hataane se sambandhit he
 Therefore the rights of this intermediate class should be obtained by giving proper compensation '
 is ghoshnaa patr se arthshaastri, raajnneetijna tathaa patrkaar sabhi sahamat the
 Zamindari system hindered Indian economic development because the big landlords were always advocates of reactionism
 ‘landan iconomist’ ne inke vishay main likhaa tha ki ‘inamen se adhiktar ‘thekarase’ ke paatr ‘lard steen’ kii tarah dushcharitra, ‘jine astine’ ke ‘mistar benet’ kii tarah aalsee, ‘surtijasquaire’ kii tarah sharaabi the 
 The Bengal Land Commission also came to the conclusion that 'permanent settlement of 1793 AD, for whatever reasons was deemed appropriate at that time, is unsuitable in today's situation and has created so many evils in the zamindari system that it is no longer in the interest of the nation Even the type is no longer useful
 ’ bhartiya tathaa paashchaatya arthvettaon kii raay main jameendaari unmoolan adhik krishi utpaadan ke liye atyaavashyak he
 In addition, this practice has ended in every part of the world due to lack of time
 punasch, yah pratha rajya ke liye adhik kharchili he
 Above all, this practice had reached such a state at this time that if it had not been eradicated, it would have caused disasters not only on national economic problem but also on social security
 at: san 1946 i0 main chunaav main safalataa ke falswaroop jab har praant main congress mantrimandal bane to chunaav pratigya ke anusaar jameendaari pratha ko samaapt karne ke liye vidheyak prastut kiye gaye
 These Bills became Act from 1950 to 1955, which resulted in the abolition of Zamindari system in India and re-established direct relations between farmers and the state
 bhoomi ke swatvadhikaar ab krishakon ko waapas mil gaye jinka upyog ve anadi paramparaagat kaal se karte chale aae the
 In this way, the zamindari system that emerged with the arrival of the British in our country also ended at the end of their rule
 is pratha kii samaapti par kisi ne tanik bhi shok prakat nahin kiya, kyonki iskaa vinaash hote hi puraane siddhant kii, jiske anusaar bhoomi kaa swami krishak hota tha, punrariti hui
 Which was the end of the Zamidari system on 02 / 10 / 1951, Gwalior princely state in Madhya Pradesh also had the system of zamindari, which was dominated by Gwalior princely state of Agar Susner etc

 Failing to obey, he threatened to crush the whole family in the crusher

 Then they became unhappy and started to remember Lord Arihant God
 prarthana karte vakt unhen neend aa gai
 In his dream, a stunning idol gave him a parable that said: - ""ghabaraane kii baat nahin he

 When Suswani ji is tired of running, she has prayed! Protect me, i can't run anymore adhishthatri devi ne prarthana suni tabhi saamne se ek singh aata hua dikhaai padaa devi ne akashwani main unhen singh par savaar hokar aage badhane ko kaha
 According to knowledge, Suswani immediately rode on the lion and the lion started running

 "bhole Shiva appeared and threw his tongs towards the front of the temple and said -" o Goddess, you go straight to where the tong has fallen, where is your place
 "bholenath kaa phenkaa hua chimata ek ker ke ped ke bich main padaa tha

 Linguistics is different from grammar

 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'

 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‘shabd’ ’arth’, ‘ras’ ‘bhav’ ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai’ sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‘‘bhashaa’’ tathaa ‘‘vigyaan’’
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‘bhashaa’ shabd sanskrit kii ‘‘bhash’’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‘vigyaan’ shabd main ‘vi’ upsarg tathaa ‘gya’ dhaatu se ‘lut’ pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakava and Dandi wrote in their great book 'kavyadarsha', informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‘avyakt vaak’ kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‘vyakt vaak’ nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‘vyakt vaak’ kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‘vyakt vaak’ kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‘yadrichhik’ sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1
 apni chir-parichit bhashaa ke vishay main jigyaasa kii tripti yaa shankaaon kaa nirmulan
 2
 Introduction to historical and prehistoric culture
 3
 kisi jati yaa sampoorn maanavtaa ke maansik vikaas kaa parichay
 4
 Solution of many problems related to the meaning, pronunciation and use of ancient literature
 5
 vishwa ke liye ek bhashaa kaa vikaas
 6
 Assistance in learning foreign languages
 7
 anuwaad karne vaali tathaa swayan tip karne vaali evam isi prakaar kii mashiinon ke vikaas or nirmaan main sahaayta
 8
 Assistance in change in terms of simplicity, correctness etc
 in language, script etc
 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that is found as a divine gift to humans
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When linguistics was included under the syllabus of large classes in the subjects of study, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that the values that remain for art in a period, new changes are present in the future and they should be accepted in other countries also, it is not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 a major feature of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been in place for the classical subjects like social science, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be termed as science in any sense
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- “jis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‘uun namah siddham’ kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‘padmavat’ ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‘somalata’ shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs — buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
 katyayan evam patanjali bhi isi koti main aate hai
 Among Greek scholars, Thrax, Discolus and Erodean also did notable work in this area
 panini se purna prabhavit hokar bluemfield ne san 1932 i
 main 'language' naamak apana granth prakashit karwaakar varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati dwaara do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon kii tulana kii jaati he
 It can also be called a mixed method, because the basis of both the descriptive method and the historical method is taken
 vivaran ke liye kisi ek kaal ko nishchit karnaa hota he or tulana ke liye kam-se-kam do bhashaaon kii apeksha hoti he
 Thus, comparative method can be called the sum of descriptive method and historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati kinhin do bhashaaon par lagu ho sakati he
 For example, comparison is also done in Indian languages - Bhojpuri etc
 Or comparative study of hindi-english, hindi-russian, hindi-persian is also done
 arthath isamen kshetragat seemaa nahin he
 Scholars like William Jones, France Bopp, Maxmüller, Curtius, August Schlikher, have made significant contributions to the development of comparative linguistics
 par, abtak tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan main un siddhanton kii badi kami he, jinke aadhaar par do bhinn bhashaaon kaa vargeekaran vaigyanik nahin ban sakaa
 The structural method is the sequel to the descriptive method
 america main is paddati kaa vishesh prachaar ho rahaa he
 In this, mechanical devices are being given more importance, which will facilitate special translation
 jalig haris ne 'methaids in strectural lingusticks ' naamak pustak likhakar is paddati ko viksit kiya
 Linguistics, like other branches of science, has experimental aspects, which require systems of experimentation and laboratory
 bhinn-bhinn yantric prayogon ke dwaara uccharnatmak swanvigyaan, bhautik swanvigyaan or shravnatmak swanvigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is also called experimental phonology, mechanical phonology or laboratory phonology
 isamen darpan jaise saamaanya upkaran se lekar jatiltam vaidyut upkarnon kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 As a result, full cooperation of mathematicians, physicists and engineers in the field of linguistics is expected
 kritrim taalu or kritrim taalu projector kii sahaayta se vyaktivishesh ke dwaara uccharit swanon ke uccharan sthaan kii pariksha kii jaati he
 The Kayamograph is useful for determining the resonance and life of the swans to know the resonance and timelines
 laringo scope se swaryantr kii sthiti kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The endoscope is an improved form of laryngoscope
 osilograph kii tarangen swanon ke bhautik swaroop ko parde par yaa film par atyant spashtataa se ankit kar detii he
 The same work is done more successfully by spectographs or sonographs
 spectograph jo chitra prastut karata he unhen pattern plabac dwaara phir se suna ja saktaa he
 Recorded material can be heard at a slow speed with the help of speechstretcher
 inke atirikt or bhi chote bade yantra hai, jinase bhashavaigyanik adhyayan main paryaapt sahaayta lee ja rahi he
 Among French linguists, Ruio wrote a treatise about the use of phonology
 landan main pro farth ne vishesh taluyantr kaa vikaas kiya
 For the measurement of vowels, as the lines of the vowel point or the quadrilateral are set, they form the basis lines for the measurement of consonants, by which the utterances can be described exactly
 danniel jans or ida ward ne bhi angreji swanvigyaan par mahatvapurn kaary kiya he
 Armstrong, Bethel and Boyanus are the main speakers of French, German and Russian languages
 saidhantik or praayogic swanvigyaan par samaan rup se kaam karanevaale vyaktiyon main nimnlikhit mukhya hai: stateson, negus potter, green or cop, martin zeus, hefnar, maul aadi
 a new mechanical effort has started here, which is related to vocabulary, semantics and grammatical forms
 yantric anuwaad ke liye vaindyut computaron kaa upyog vaigyanik yug kii ek vishesh dein he
 It is a very interesting and useful subject of applied linguistics
 vistrut vivechan ke liye anuprayukt bhashavigyaan dekhen
 Radar is a system of detecting objects that uses microtransactions
 isaki sahaayta se gatiman vastuon jaise vayuyan, jalayaan, motargadiyon aadi kii duuri, oonchai, disha, chaal aadi kaa dur se hi pataa chal jaataa he
 Apart from this, rapid changes in the weather are also known
 'radar' shabd multah ek sankshipt rup he jiskaa prayog america kii nausena ne 1940 main 'radio ditection and reging' ke liye prayog kiya tha
 Later this abbreviated form became so prevalent that English vocabulary was introduced and capital letters are no longer used for it
 lakhpati vah vyakti hota he jiske paas 1 lakh yaa isse adhik kii sampatti ho
 This property can be both movable or immovable
 chal sampatti ke antargat rupaya-paisa, dhan-daulat, aabhushan ityadi aate he or achal sampatti yani vah sampatti jo ek hi sthaan par rahati he jaise bhoomi, makaan, bhawan ityadi
 The use of the term Lakhpati is more prevalent in India and other South Asian languages as there are a number of millions of Indian numerals
 antarrashtriya maapan pranali main "miliener" kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo 10,00,000 ke baraabar hota he
 Sati was a religious practice practiced in some ancient Indian Hindu communities, in which a man's self-sacrificed self after his death by entering his funeral pyre during his funeral
 1829 main angrejon dwaara bharat main ise gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kiye jane ke baad se yah pratha praaia: samaapt ho gayi
 This tradition derives its name from the name of Goddess Sati, also known as Dakshayani
 hindu dharmik granthon ke anusaar devi sati ne apane pita daksh dwaara apane pati mahadev shiv ke tiraskaar se vyathit ho yajna kii agni main kudakar aatmadah kar liya tha
 The word sati is often used alone or combined with the word savitri to describe a "holy woman"
 pracheen kaal main sati pratha kaa ek yah bhi kaaran rahaa tha
