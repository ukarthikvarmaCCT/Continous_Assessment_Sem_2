 Due to the widespread cultural influences of concurrent white castes, their ancient culture is undergoing rapid changes
 unhen vinasht hone se bachaane ke liye pichley kuch dashakon main shashan kii ore se vishesh praytn kiye gaye hai
 Many possibilities, fantasies and beliefs have been introduced from time to time regarding the origin of American Indians
 kuch logon kaa anumaan tha ki ve isroyal kii das khoi hui jatiyon ke vanshaj he or kuch log unhen sikandar kii jalsena ke bhatke hue bedon ke navikon kii santan maanate hai
 In relation to this, there was also the belief that they are the offspring of the original inhabitants of the fictional island called "atlantis continent" or "moo" of the Pacific Ocean mentioned in legends
 madhya america kii maaya indian jati or pracheen misr kii sthapatyakala main samta drushtigat hone ke kaaran yah anumaan bhi kiya gaya ki indian misr athwa misr se prabhavit deshon se america aae
 In this context, it is necessary to know that the ancient architecture of Egypt had declined several thousand years before the time when the Mayan Indians started construction of temples
 america main pracheen maanav sambandhi vaigyanik khojein hone ke pehle yah sambhavta bhi thi ki indianon ke purvaj is bhoomi par maanav jati kii ek swatantra shakha ke rup main viksit hue hon, parantu ab yah nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki amareeki mahadwipon par maanav jati kii koi shakha ke vikascram main is bhubhag par keval limar, tarasier or katipay jatiyon ke bandaron ke prastikrut avshesh hi mili hai
 Even after diligently searching the scholars of ancient mankind, near human apes or ancient human beings could not find any remains here
 is tarah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yahan maanav jati kii kisi shakha ke swatantra vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin thi or yahan ke pracheenatam nivaasiyon ke purvaj sansar ke kisi anya bhaag se aakar hi yahan based honge
 Experts believe that humans came to this part from Asia via the Bering Strait
 shaareerik visheshtaon kii drushti se indian asandigdh rup se asia kii mongolaide prajati kii ek shakha maane ja sakate hai
 The ancestors of Indians who came to America via the route from the Ashes to Alaska had certainly developed to the level of modern humans or "homo sapiens"
 ve apane saath apni mul asian samskruti ke anek tatv bhi avashya laae honge
 He was probably familiar with the use of fire and had also learned to manufacture and use the weapons and equipment of the medieval culture

 It can also be said that they must have developed some primary form of language by that time

 For several hundred years, these groups had to come by snow-covered landmarks; But it is possible that later groups may travel partly in boats as well

 In time, the intermingling of these groups became the dominant feature of Mongoloid species among Indians
 ye aadi indian apane apane saath nav-prastar-yug ke pehle kii samskritiyon ke kuch tatv is bhoomi par laae
 While trying to reconstruct their original culture, Kroeber has made a list of the culture elements who probably came to America along with the Adi Indians
 dabaav dwaara yaa ghiskar banaae hue pathar ke aujaar, paalish, kiye hue haddi or sing ke upkaran, aag kaa upyog, jaal or tokare banane kii kala, dhanush or bhaalaa phenkane ke yantra or paaltu kute sambhavat: indianon kii mul samskruti ke mukhya tatv maane ja sakate hai

 garsoli, didihat tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke pithoragarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Planchet is a device of theists who write 'self' and it is believed that it is used to receive messages from the imaginary 'ghosts' of other worlds
 mukhyatah 19veen shatabdi main yah bahut lokapriy ho chalaa tha
 It is a device made of thin and light and smooth wood of the shape of a betel leaf, but larger than that
 isamen nok kii ore pencil phasaane ke liye ek gol chhed or peeche kii or neeche do pahie lage hote hai
 Through the wheels, this device starts moving with a little pressure and support from above, and by walking, marks are made by the pencil on the paper on which the machine runs
 san 1853 main iskaa avishkaar ek francisi aatmavaadi ne kiya tha
 When a medium removes its consciousness from the body and allows a dead creature to activate its body and place its hand or fingers on the planchet, then the dead soul starts to move the planchet through that hand and the pencil which it wants to write
 She writes madhyam kaa sharir or visheshat: haath apni aatma ke niyantran main na rahakar mrit aatma ke niyantran main kuch kaal ke liye aa jaataa he or uske dwaara mrit aatma jo kuch jivit praaniyon ko kahana chaahati he kah detii he
 The planchet starts to move backwards for a while
 uske dwaara spasht aksharon main kuch na kuch likhaa bhi jaataa he
 Answers to questions are also written
 par likhanewaala vah madhyam he jiskaa haath usapar rakhaa hota he athwa uske dwaara koi duusari aatma likhti he - iskaa nirnay karnaa asambhav nahin to kathin jarur he
 People do not always cheat on purpose
 agyaat reeti se bhale hi ve yaa unka haath planchet ko chalaata ho
 But there can be no proof that something is being written by another soul or something is being written by the unconscious mind of the medium or by any higher level of mind
 kabhi-kabhi aiti baaten bhi likhi jaati hai jinka gyaan madhyam ko apane jivan main kabhi bhi nahin hua
 This type of knowledge is either expressed by the dead soul or it is also possible that the unknown mind of the medium has acquired the knowledge by its supernatural and inherent powers and has expressed it by writing on the pretext of a dead soul
 ab yah nirvivaad siddh ho chukaa he ki manushya ke agyaat man main anek alokik shaktiyaan nihit hai jo kisi kisi maansik avasthaa main prakat ho jaati he
 Therefore, some people believe that through the planchet, we get the same knowledge that the inner mind of the medium has received
 planchet par kabhi kabhi itihaas ke mahan mrit vyaktiyon dwaara bhi bahut si baton kaa likhaa janaa anubhav main aayaa he
 One wonders whether those great souls are so close to each living person and do they get so much time that they reach where they are sometimes without being called
 planchet par bhoot, vartmaan or bhavishya kii baaten likhi jaati hai
 Sometimes predictions come out right
 kabhi kabhi jo baat kisi paas baithanevaalon or madhyam ko bhi maaloom nahin ve bhi planchet par likhi jaati he
 In fact Planchet is a wonderful device

 Signs are a type of word power
 lakshana, shabd kii vah shakti he jisase uskaa abhipraay suchit hota he
 Sometimes it happens that the simple meaning of the word does not reveal its true meaning
 vaastavik abhipraay uske saadhaaran arth se kuch bhinn hota he
 The power with which the word appears different from its ordinary and other real meaning is called the symptom
 shabd kaa vah arth jo abhidha shakti dwaara praapt na ho balki lakshana shakti dwaara praapt ho, lakshitaarth kehalaata he
 In literature, the symptom power is considered to be of two types - Stratha and Purushwati
 jahaan par kuch lakshyarth rudh ho gaye hai
 Such as 'skilled at work'
 kushal kaa shabdaarth 'kush ikattha karanevaala' hota he, par yah shabd daksh yaa nipun ke arth main rudh ho gaya he
 This type of meaning is revealed by rudhilakshana
 roodhi lakshana main roodhi ke kaaran mukhyarth ko chhodkar usase sambandh rakhane vaala anya arth grahan kiya jaae
 Like 'rajasthan is heroic
 ' rajasthan pradesh vir nahin ho saktaa
 There is an obstacle to the main purpose in this
 isse iskaa lakshyarth 'rajasthan nivasee' hota he, kyonki rajasthan se uske nivasee kaa aadharadhebhav kaa sambandh he
 It is common for Rajasthanis to say 'rajasthan'
 vah lakshana jo prayojan dwaara vaacharth se bhinn arth prakat kare
 Purposive symptoms are characterized for the accomplishment of a particular purpose, such as- 'bahut si talavaarein maidan main aa gayi' is vaakya main yadi ham talwaar kaa arth talwaar hi karke rah jate hai to arth main baadha padati he
 For this purpose, we have to take the meaning of sword as a sword soldier
 atah jis lakshana dwaara yah arth liya vah prayojanavati hui
 There are two main distinctions of Purushavati Ghatna - Gauni, Shuddha
 gauni main saadrishy sambandh se arthath samaan gun yaa dharm ke kaaran lakshyarth kaa grahan kiya jaae
 In the Shuddha Ghatna, there is a sense of purpose from the relation other than analogy relationship
 shuddha lakshana ke chaar bhed hai- upadan lakshana, lakshanlakshana, saropa lakshana or saadhyavsaanaa lakshana
 Where the meaning of the sentence is not missed even when the other meaning is targeted, it is a derivative
 upadan kaa arth he grahan-lenaa
 There is no complete renunciation of speech
 jaise, 'pagadi kii laaj rakhiye
 The shame of a turban holder is for the purpose
 yahan pagadi apana arth na chhodte hue pagadidhari kaa akshep karata he
 Here both are together
 at: upadan lakshana he
 For the accomplishment of a sentence, if the sentence itself leaves its meaning and informs the target, there is a symptom
 isamen amukhyarth ko anivat hone ke liye mukhyarth apana arth bilkul chhod detaa he
 Like, 'the stomach is on fire
 ' yah ek sarthak vaakya he
 In this, the sentence 'agni hai' leaves its meaning and the goal is that there is hunger
 isse lakshan-lakshana he

 In relation to this, it was argued that the original source of all these languages is the same - today known as Portuguese and European, in fact these are languages whose ancestors of speakers were European, Iranian Aryans

 In this book, he writes that he wrote "when Sargon II and Sardanapulus ruled over Assyria" and "he was at war with Syria, Egypt and Babylonia"
 As such, Wells suggests that the Aryans ultimately "possessed the entire ancient world, the Jews, the Aegean, and Egypt alike"
 In 1944, the World Map, prepared by Rand mcnally, listed the Aryans as one of the ten best groups of mankind
 skanddinavian mul ke nasl virdohi ichaswatantrywadee upanyaskaar paul anderson, jo ki vigyaan galp ke lekhak the, ne apane vibhinn laghu kathaon, upanyaason, laghu upanyaason main baar-baar hind europee logon ke liye aryaayi shabd kaa paryaayavachi shabd, ke rup main istemaal kiya he
 He called Aryan a hound that inspires them to go to other planets and capture them and encourage them to serve as colonies in other planetary systems and as pioneers in the era of new colonialism

 In the 19th century, the science of mankind has been shown by some scholars to be a symbol of scientific racist tendencies, "aryan lineages" are seen as a subset of the indo-european race that originally belonged to the indo-european language language
 Were the speakers, whose descendants were Portuguese, indo-european, Europe, Asian Russia, anglo-america, Southern South America, Southern Africa, the continent of Australia , New Zealand, Armenia, Greater Iran and Northern India, and lived in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives in southern Asia

 In his 1861 Lectures on the Science of Language, he used the term Aryan as "race of people", that is, a caste of people
 us vakt jati shabd kaa prayog kabeelon yaa sajaateey samooh ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 When, according to Muller's statement, the Aryans came to be called a special group of mankind, he made it clear that he meant descendant and not special race, he said that the mixture of philology and anthropology is a dangerous Is the principle
 usne kaha ki "bhashaa vigyaan or maanav-vigyaan bahut zyada bhinn nahin ho sakate


 lekin main jarur doharaana chahta hum jo maine pahave bahut baar kaha he ki aryan khun ko lambaa sheersh vaala kahana galat he

 mular kaa ye jaateey maanav shaastra ke vikaas kaa jawaab darasal arthur de gobiniu ke liye tha jo ye maanata tha ki hind europee sarvshereshth jati kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Many later authors, such as the French writer Vacher de Lapouge, in their book l'aryen, argue that this particular race can also be identified by using physiognomy and other indicators by their physical appearance
 unhone tark diya ki lambey sar vaale europea uttari europe main paae jate the jo aam taur par "brachiosephalik" vaale logon par shashan kiya karte the

 However, later some anthropologists and archaeologists associated this linguistic classification of "aryans" with Chhetriyata, especially from northern Europe
 19ve shatabdi main is mat ko kaaphi prasiddhi mili
 In the middle of the 19th century it was said that the Aryans originated in the southwestern part, now known as Russia

 The German origins of the Aryans were prominently promoted by archaeologist Gustaf Kozina and claimed that proto-indo-europeans were similar to the Corded Ware culture of Neolithic Germany

 This doctrine of virtuoso gave rise to many controversies
 hoston stewart chemberlen jo ki aaryon ki shreshthata kaa kaayal tha, joseph kollmann ke tarkon kaa vistaar se jawaab diya
 Although the "aryan race" was popularly conceived, especially in Germany, there were some who were strongly against it, Otto Schrader, Rudolf von Tshering, and Robert Hartmann fully supported the principles of virtuoso, with Robert the human being - Demanded the use of the word "aryan" from the scripture to ban it

 kai shodh kehete hai ki fasalon main aa pahunchane vaala balwarm jeevanu raksha ke liye chode gaye jin kaa tod hasil kar rahaa he
 Other research has shown that many more bacteria also attack plants
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki jiem fasalon kii paidaavaar aam fasalon se adhik he, to kai anya iske vipareet aankade pesh karte hai
 Earlier experiments in India have been done on crops like GM rice, in which more protein is present
 isse purv desh main fasalon ke hibridigeshan bhartiya parivesh ke lihaaj se sahi sabit nahin hue the
 Due to which crops were damaged in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and many other parts and this has also been a major reason for farmers committing suicides due to debt burden
 jiem fasalon se jude utpaadan sambandhi vishay bhi hai
 There are also health and environmental issues related to it, which are under dispute
 jiem fasalon kii lagaataar jaanch jari he taaki isse judi allergy aadi kaa pataa chal sake
 So far, gene transfer problem has been detected in a few cases
 paryaavaran purodhaon kaa dar he ki nishechit jin apane kaary se itar karrwai kar saktaa he jis kaaran anya paudhon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchane kaa khatra bana hua he
 This has been found to have been done in some researches as well, but the far-reaching impact on its human and plant health has not yet been discussed in a proper manner and that is why the question from environmental experts is still standing
 paaramparik fasal utpaadan se itar jin badlaav se fasalon ko na keval hanikaarak kitnashkon se jujhane kii kshamta praapt hoti he, balki unamem sookhaa jhelane or behatar poshakta dene ke gun bhi aate hai
 GM crops grow quickly and cost less
 aichhik badlaav kuch hi fasalein ugaakar praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 With the improvement of the taste etc
 of the crop, one gets the ability to selectively improve the beneficial elements and there is no repetition of involuntary and waste elements in the crop
 visheshgyon ke anusaar in kshamtaaon se krishi utpaadan main kam se kam shram se badhotaree kii ja sakati he
 Pesticides are less used
 fasalon ko vipareet vaataavaran main bhi ugaaya ja saktaa he
 Different GM crops have been grown in many countries
 swasthya kii drushti se dekhen to abhi tak iskaa koi pukhta pramaan maujuud nahin he ki jiem fasalon se sehat ko sidhe taur par koi nuksaan pahunchataa ho
 However, there is no guarantee
 jiem fasalon se anjaane main allergy, antibytic virodh, poshan kii kami or vishaaktata ho sakati he
 Despite this, experts say that to reach food to every hungry stomach, we have to base our traditional food style
 san 2002 main desh main 55 hajaar kisaanon ne desh ke chaar madhya or dakshini rajyon main kapaas fasal ugaai thi
 Four months after planting the crop, cotton growing on cotton had stopped growing
 iske baad pattiyaan girane lageen
 Bollworm was also causing damage to crops
 akele andhra pradesh main hi kapaas kii 79 pratishat fasal ko nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 The entire cotton crop was destroyed in Madhya Pradesh
 maharashtra main bhi tees hajaar hectare main ugaai gai fasal barbaad ho gai thi
 As a result, more than 200 farmers committed suicides and lost crores of rupees
 baad main nattejey saamne aae ki keet ke kaaran fasal ko nuksaan pahunchaa tha or yah fasal paaramparik or beati donon thim
 In fact, GM seeds were first introduced in India in 1996 for the first time
 usase purv kareeb 25 deshon main unka istemaal kiya ja chukaa tha
 Preparations have been made for the production of ten other GM crops in the country
 haalanki inke bazaar main aane kaa maarg tabhi tay ho sakegaa jabaki beati bangan ko vyavsaayik taur par safalataa milegi
 Other crops are vegetables such as rice, potatoes, tomatoes, maize, groundnut, cabbage
 vaise kul 56 jiem fasalon ke utpaadan kii taiyaari he jinamein se 41 khadyann se judi hai
 However, BT cotton has been commercially released and has been a success
 lekin anya jo fasalein jin par abhi prayogshaala main shodh chal rahe hai vah hai gehun, basmati chaaval, seb, kelaa, papeeta, pyaaj, tarbooz, mirch, coffee or soyabean
 Research is also going on on many non-food crops
 jiem fasalon se jude tamaam virodhon ko dekhte hue haal main sarkaar ne biotechnology regulatory athurity bill par teji se kaary karne kaa nirnay liya he
 With regard to the debate on Bt food grains in India, the environment ministry has decided that it will stop the cultivation of Bt brinjal for the time being
 bill main jan swasthya se jude is sambandh main ek teen sadasyeey swytt biotechnology regulatory athurity kii sifarish kii gai he
 Apart from this, this authority will also monitor the experiments and production tests of GM Rice and GM Tomato etc
 yani is athurity ke paas jiem fasalon ke vyavsaay se jude sabhi udhyamiyon ko apane paas bulaane kaa or samooche jiem vyavsaay kshetra par najar rakhane kaa visheshadhikaar hoga
 This autonomous unit will have three branches
 pehali, krishi, van or matsya udyog par najar rakhegi, duusari, jan swasthya or vaiteronari muddon par or teesri audyogic or paryaavaran vishyon par najar rakhegi
 The Authority will also have a unit to monitor imports and approve research for all organisms used in biotechnology
 sarkaar ne sifarish rakhi he ki yadi koi gaiyr kanoonee pareekshan kiya jaataa he to usamen kam se kam paanch varsh kii kaid or baari jurmaana bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In this case those who commit crimes again will be punished even harder
 chunki jaev-praudyogiki jan swasthya se judaa mudda he
 The bill also recommends setting up a tribunal to hear complaints against any decision of the authority
 yani kahana na hoga ki yadi yah bill sheeghra sansad ke jariye nae kanoon ke taur par saamne aata he to uske tahat desh main biotech utpaadon par shodh, utpaadan or unase jude vyapaar par nae sire se niamak lagu honge
 Since the commercial use of the first GM crop in 1996, GM crops have been under cultivation on eight percent of the world's arable land
 aamtaur par kisaanon ko apni pichhali fasal ke kuch hisse ko bachaakar rakhana padataa he taaki agali fasal ropi ja sake
 But GM crops require special seeds
 yah beej mahange hote hai or aam kisaan kii pahunch se dur bhi
 Royalty has to be paid for their reuse and farmers cannot reuse the seeds of the previous crop of their fields
 or saath hi yah bhi tark diya jaataa he ki behatar fasal or kitnashkon ke kam istemaal ke kaaran kisaan adhik puunji bachaa lete hai, isliye unhen agali fasal ke liye bijon kaa bhugtan karnaa chahie
 This is the reason why the government has also insisted to implement stringent regulations related to GM crops
 duniya ke kai deshon main jiem fasalein istemaal main laai jaati hai
 These include most of the countries of North and South America where GM crops of soybean, corn, rye and beet etc
 are grown and used
 sanyukt rajya america main puri duniya kii aadhi se adhik jiem fasalein istemaal kii jaati hai
 In contrast, only seven countries in Europe have so far been given legal recognition for the use of GM crops
 asia main bhi bharat or china samet keval teen deshon main hi jiem fasalon ko istemaal main laae jane kii shuruyaat hui he, lekin iske liye kade niamak hai
 There are only three countries in Africa that have allowed the use of GM crops so far

 Since its discovery so far, the number of known Kiper enclosure objects has exceeded one thousand and is estimated to be over 100,000 kbo's with a diameter of over 100 km
 prarambh main yah sochaa gaya tha ki kyper belt hi un saavadhik dhoomaketuon kaa bhandar he jinaki kakshayen 200 saalon se kam avadhi vaali hai
 However, studies since the nineties have shown that this enclosure is dynamically stable, and that the actual site of the comets' origin is a scattering disk created dynamically by Neptune's extraterrestrial movement 4
5 billion years ago
 Is an active circle; Some objects of this dissected disk, such as Aris, etc
, have very high decentralization, and they even go up to 100 AU from the Sun in their orbit

 satraa varsh kii avasthaa main mehrunnisa kaa vivaah 'alikuli' naamak ek saahsee irani navayuvak se hua tha, jise jahangir ke rajya kaal ke prarambh main sher afakhaan kii oopaadhi or bardwan kii jaagir di gai thi
 In 1607 AD Jahangir's messengers killed Sher Afghan in a battle
 mehrunnisa ko pakad kar dilli laayaa gaya or use badshaah ke shahi haram main bhej diya gaya
 Here she became the hostess of Queen 'salima Begum', the widow of Emperor Akbar
 mehrunnisa ko jahangir ne sarvapratham nauroz tyohaar ke avasar par dekha or uske soundarya par mugdh hokar jahangir ne may, 1611 i
 main usase vivaah kar liya
 After marriage, Jahangir conferred upon him the titles of 'nurmahal' and 'nur Jahan'
 1613 i
 main noorjehan ko ‘pattamahishi’ yaa ‘badshaah begum’ banaaya gay Apart from being an extraordinary beauty, Nur Jahan was also intelligent, modesty and prudent
 uski sahitya, kavita or lalit kalaon main vishesh ruchi thi
 His target distinction was infallible
 1619 i
 main usne ek hi goli se sher ko maar giraaya tha
 Because of all these qualities she had established complete dominion over her husband
 iske falswaroop jahangir ke shashan kaa samast bhaar usee par aa padaa tha
 Her name also began to be dug on the coins and she started to court in the palace itself
 uske pita etmaduddola or bhai aasaf khaan ko mogul darbar main ucch pad pradaan kiya gaya tha or uski bhatiji kaa vivaah, jo aage chalakar mumtaz ke naam se prasiddh hui, shahjahan se ho gaya
 She married her daughter, born to the first husband, to Jahangir's youngest son Shaharyar, and because she had no children from Jahangir, she wanted Shaharyar to sit on the throne after Jahangir
 noorjehan ke ye sabhi kaary uski kootneeti kaa hi ek hissaa the
 By the end of 1620 AD, Nur Jahan's relations with Khurram were not good, because by now Nur Jahan had realized that his influence on the affairs of the government would be reduced when Shah Jahan became king
 isliye noorjehan ne jahangir ke duusare putr ‘shehryaar’ ko mahatv dena prarambh kar kiya
 Since Shaharyar was of short age and weak character, Nur Jahan's influence on his becoming emperor would have continued in the works of governance as before
 is kaaran se sher afakhaan se utpann apni putree 'ladli begum' kii shaadi 1620 i
 main shehryaar se kar use 8000 / 4000 kaa mansab pradaan kiya
 When Shah Jahan realized that Nur Jahan wanted to reduce his influence, he revolted in the Deccan in 1623, disobeying Jahangir's order to invade Kandahar fort and win it
 
 uske vidroh ko dabaane ke liye noorjehan ne aasaf khaan ko na bhej kar mahavat khaan ko shahzada parvaiz ke netritv main bheja
 Both of them successfully crushed Shah Jahan's rebellion
 shahjahan ne pita jahangir ke samaksh atsamarpan kar diya or use kshamaa mil gai
 As a surety, two sons of Shah Jahan, Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb, were kept in the court as hostages
 1625 i
 tak shahjahan kaa vidroh purnatah shant ho gaya
 Nur Jahan got jealous of Mahavat Khan who played an important role in suppressing Shah Jahan's rebellion
 noorjehan ko iskaa ahsaas tha, ki mahavat khaan un logon main se he, jinhen shashan ke kaaryon main meraa prabhutv sweekaar nahin he
 Nur Jahan was also threatened by the proximity of Mahavat Khan and Shahzada Parvez
 atah uske prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye noorjehan ne use bengal jane evam yuddh ke samay luute gayi dhan kaa hisaab dene ko kaha
 Apart from these reasons, there were other reasons as well, due to which, feeling insulted, Mahavat Khan revolted and captured Emperor Jahangir going to Kabul on the banks of river Jhelum in 1626 AD
 noorjehan evam uske bhai aasaf khaan ko bhi bandi bana liya
 Even in prison, Mahavat Khan did not think of loyalty and respect for Jahangir
 rohtas main noorjehan evam jahangir ne kootneeti ke dwaara apane ko mahavat khaan ke prabhaav se mukt kar liya
 Mahavat Khan ran towards 'thatta' for his protection
 28 oktober, 1626 ko parvej kii mrityu ke baad ek tarah se mahavat khaan kamazor ho gaya or vah shahjahan kii seva main chalaa gaya
 During Jahangir's life, Nur Jahan was omnipotent, but after Jahangir's death in 1627, his political sovereignty was destroyed
 noorjehan kii mrityu 1645 i
 main hui
 He spent the rest of his life in Lahore till his death
 uski kalatmak ruchi kaa pramaan us bhavy evam aakarshak madhbare main uplabdh he, jise usne apane pita etmaduddola ke asthi avasheshon par agra main banwaaya tha
 According to the artists, this tomb is fine and unique in terms of decoration

 This civilization is considered to be the deepest root of modern Western cultures, so Greek civilization has always been very important for Western historians
 mana jaataa he ke is sabhyataa ke baad aane vaale roman samrajya par pracheen yunaan kaa gaharaa asar tha or us samrajya or samskruti ke kai pahaluon main unani samskruti kii chhap dekhi ja sakati he
