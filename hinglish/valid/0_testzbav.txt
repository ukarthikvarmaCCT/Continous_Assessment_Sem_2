 Ornamentation ornamentation; Alankar: Alam means Bhushan
 jo bhooshit kare vah alankaar he
 Alankars are elements that enhance the beauty of kavita-kamini
 jis prakaar aabhushan se nari kaa lavanya bad jaataa he, usee prakaar alankaar se kavita kii shobhaa bad jaati he
 It is said - 'alankaroti Iti Alankarah': In Indian literature, alliteration, upma, metaphor, anunvay, Yamak, syllable, catalysis, doubt, exaggeration, curvature etc
 are the major figures
 is kaaran vyutpatti se upama aadi alankaar kehalaate hai
 The word Alankar for Upma etc
 has been used in a narrow sense
 vyapak rup main saundarya maatr ko alankaar kehete hai or usee se kavy grahan kiya jaataa he
 
 charutv ko bhi alankaar kehete hai
 
 bhamah ke vichaar se vakrarthvija ek shabdokti athwa shabdarthvachitrya kaa naam alankaar he
 The Rudrat designation is called the special form
 
 Alankar for Dandi is the graceful religion of poetry
 saundarya, charutv, kavyasobhakar dharm in teen roopon main alankaar shabd kaa prayog vyapak arth main hua he or shesh main shabd tathaa arth ke anuprasopamaadi alankaaron ke sankuchit arth main
 In one, the ornamentation is acquired as a vital element of poetry and in the other as a furnisher
 saamanyat: kathaneey vastu ko achche se achche rup main abhivyakti dene ke vichaar se alankaar prayukt hote hai
 Through these, either the emotions are exalted or the form, quality, and action are made more intense
 at: man kaa oj hi alankaaron kaa vaastavik kaaran he
 Interested people and miraculous people use words and emotional person use semantics
 shabdalankaron ke prayog main purarukti, prayatnlaghav tathaa uccharan yaa dhvanisamya mukhya aadharbhoot siddhant maane jate hai or punarukti ko hi aavriti kahkar iske varna, shabd tathaa pad ke kram se teen bhed maane jate hai, jinamein kramash: anupras or chhek evam yamak, pararuktavdabhas tathaa latanupras ko grahan kiya jaataa he
 Vratanuprasa is an example of Prayatnalaghava

 The soundtrack is evident in Shrutyanupras

 Economics are formed on the basis of moods called emotional states, novel rights and reasoning
 gyaan ke sabhi kshetron main alankaarein kii saamagree lee jaati he, jaise vyakaran ke aadhaar par kriyamoolak bhavik or visheshya-visheshan-mulak alankaaron kaa prayog hota he
 From psychology, the contents of remembrance, confusion, doubt, and inspiration are taken, from philosophy, work-cause-related inconsistencies, for and proof etc
 are taken, and different forms of jurisprudence, syntax, logic and lokanya, respectively, are formed
 upama jaise kuch alankaar bhautik vigyaan se sambandhit hai or rasalankar, bhavalankar tathaa kriyachaaturivaale alankaar naatyashaastra se grahan kiye jate hai
 The Acharyas have spoken about the place and importance of ornamentation in poetry, considering the poetess, its routine and outward virtues
 is sambandh main inkaa vichaar, gun, ras, dhwani tathaa swayan ke prasang main kiya jaataa he
 The ornaments in the form of Shobhasrishta are considered themselves as ornaments and they are considered as benefactors like ornaments as an enhancer of the beauty
 pehle rup main ve kavy ke nityadharm or duusare rup main ve anityadharm kehalaate hai
 Such ideas laid the foundation of two sides in ornamentation
 ek paksh ne, jo ras ko hi kavy kii aatma maanata he, alankaaron ko gaun maanakar unhen asthiradharm mana or duusare paksh ne unhen gunon ke sthaan par nityadharm sweekaar kar liya
 The body of poetry began to be imagined and represented
 acharya vaaman ne vyapak arth ko grahan karte hue sankeern arth kii charchaa ke samay alankaaron ko kavy kaa shobhaakar dharm na maanakar unhen keval gunon main atishyata laanevaala hetu mana 
 Acharya Anandavardhan has considered them as akin to katakundal etc
 on poetry
 
 Acharya Mammatt has followed the virtues similar to the Shauryadic Angi religions and adorned those virtues with the Angadvara of those qualities
 He did not consider the virtues to be eternal and ornate in virtues, even if he was not in poetry
 acharya hemchandra tathaa acharya vishwanath donon ne unhen angashrith hi mana he
 Hemachandra has even said "angashritastavalankara:" and Vishwanath has not considered him as essential in virtue in poetry as a volatile religion
 isi prakaar yadhyapi agnipuranakar ne "vagvadhagdhyapradhanapi rasevathrajivitam" kahkar kavy main ras kii pradhanta sweekaar kii he, tathaapi alankaaron ko nitant anaavashyak na maanakar unhen shobhaatishaayi kaaran maan liya he 
 In protest against these views, in the 13th century, Jayadeva has distinguished the Alankars as poetry, giving them a compulsory place
 jo vyakti agni main ushnata na maanata ho, usee kii buddhivaala vyakti vah hoga jo kavy main alankaar na maanata ho
 Alankara is the daily routine of poetry
 is vivaad ke rahete hue bhi aanandavardhan jaise samanvayvaadiyon ne alankaaron kaa mahatv pratipaadit karte hue unhen aantar maanane main hichak nahin dikhaai he
 The juices are expressed by speech only and by the exponent words of the phrase, the publisher of Rasadi, the ornament, metaphor, etc
 are also spoken, so they should be treated as intimate qualities
 bahirangta keval prayatnsadhy yamak aadi ke sambandh main maani jaaegi 
 Even with the idea of abhinavagupta, planning the ornaments in a rhymeless poem is like decorating the corpse, if they will be used as an ornamental assistant, then they will not remain katakavat, giving pleasure and beauty to the body like Kunkum with amazing beauty
 Will decorate Even they will become poetry
 jaise kheltaa hua balak raja kaa rup banaakar apane ko sachmuch raja hi samajhataa he or uske saathi bhi use vaisaa hi samajhate hai, vaise hi ras ke poshak alankaar bhi pradhan ho sakate hai 
 Acharyas before Vamana have not considered distinction in ornamentation and qualities
 bhamah "bhavik" alankaar ke liye 'gun' shabd kaa prayog karte hai
 Dandi uses the word "passage" for both and if Agnipuranakara considers Anupam Shobha's ajaak to be a virtue in poetry, Dandi also describes the grace of poetry as an adornment of religion
 vaaman ne hi gunon kii upama yuvati ke sahaj saundarya se or shaleenta aadi uske sahaj gunon se dekar gunrahit kintu alankaaramayi rachana kavy nahin mana he
 After this the tradition of this type of deliberation came into vogue
 dhvanyalok main "ananta hi vagvikalpa:" kahkar alankaaron kii aganeyata kii ore sanket kiya gaya he
 Dandi has instructed their continual growth by saying "te Chadyaapi Optionyante"
 tathaapi vichaarkon ne alankaaron ko shabdalankar, arthalankar, rasalankar, bhavalankar, mishralankar, ubhayalankar tathaa sansristi or sankar naamak bhedon main baanta he
 Among them are the key words and the dependent ornaments of meaning
 yah vibhaag anvayavyatirek ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 When the synonym of a word does not have the same line of sound in the line, then the root word is used to describe it, and when the synonyms of the word also do not make a difference in the meaning of the meaning
 saadrishy aadi ko alankaaron ke mul main paakar pehle pehle udbhat ne vishayanusaar, kul 44 alankaaron ko chah virgon main vibhajit kiya tha, kintu inase alankaaron ke vikaas kii bhinn avasthaaon par prakaash padane kii apeksha bhinn pravritiyon kaa hi pataa chalata he
 Rudrat has achieved success for the first time in terms of scientific classification
 unhone vastav, aupmy, atishay or shlesh ko aadhaar maanakar unke chaar varg kiye hai
 The description of the nature of the object is actually
 iske antargat 23 alankaar aate hai
 Comparing the appearance of an object with that of an unprepared one and presenting it clearly is considered to be formal 21 ornaments
 arth tathaa dharm ke niyamon ke viparyay main athishaymulak 12 alankaar or anek arthonvaale padon se ek hi arth kaa bodh karaanevaale shleshamulak 10 alankaar hote hai
 The main forms of ornamentation are considered to be distinct - semantic, semantic and bisexual
 shabd ke parivrittisah sthalon main arthalankar or shabdon kii parivritti na sahanevaale sthalon main shabdalankar kii vishistataa rahane par ubhayalankar hota he
 Embellishments can be in two forms - only forms and mixed forms
 mishran kii dwividhta ke kaaran "sankar" tathaa "sansristi" alankaaron kaa udai hota he
 Among the glossaries, alliteration, pun, pun, and curvature are prominent
 arthalankaron kii sankhya lagbhag ek sau pachis tak pahunch gai he
 Keeping in mind the basic features of all economies, the Acharyas have mainly divided them into five classes: kavy main jab kisi prasiddh vyakti yaa vastu kii samta duusare samaan gun vaale vyakti yaa vastu se kii jaati he tab upama alankaar hota he
 Examples - atishyokti = atishay + ukti = badhaa-chadhaakar kahana
 When something is exaggerated, then exaggeration is ornamentation
 udhaaharan - Where the subhuman is accused of the subhuman, there is metaphorical ornamentation, or where the subhuman is accused of the subhuman because of the very similarity of virtue, there is metaphorical ornamentation
 roopak alankaar main gun kii atyant samanta dikhaane ke liye upmey or upmaan ko "abhinn" arthath "ek" kar diya jaataa he
 That is, the subhuman is superimposed on the subcommand
 udhaaharan:— Where the work is found to be in spite of reason, there is deception
 udhaaharan - The pass and frequency of one or several characters is called alliteration
 jaise;- chaaru-chandra kii chanchal kirne a word then again beyond, where many times
 arth or hi or ho, soye yamak alankaar
 Example: - 1, but the bars are Urbasi, Sun Radheke Sujan
 2, kanak kanak te sau guni,maadakta adhikaye
 3, Kali Ghata arrogance decreased yah alankaar shabd arth dono main prayukt hota hai
 a word has two meanings in syllable decking
 jaise rahiman pani raakhiye,bin pani sab sun
 Water did not go away, Moti Manush Choon 
 Water has been used three times here, but the word water used in the second line has three meanings - water in the context of pearl means water in the context of luminosity or kanti, water in the context of honor lime, water means ordinary water
 
 pratyaksh arth ke atirikt bhinn arth samaj lenaa vakrokti alankaar kehalaata he
 The place where the two normal or both particular sentences contain image-image expressions is at that place
 is alankaar main upmey rup main kahin gai baat se milti-julati baat upmaan rup main duusare vaakya main hoti he
 Examples ek myaan main do talavaarein, Can never live
 kisi or par prem naariyaan, What can a husband bear
 is alankaar main ek myaan do talavaaron kaa rahanaa vaise hi asambhav he jaisaa ki ek pati kaa do naariyon par anurakt rahanaa
 Therefore, the image-image is being seen here

 kumarasambhavam mahakavi kalidas virachit kartikeya ke janm se sambandhit mahakavy he jisaki gananaa sanskrit ke 'panch mahakavyon' main kii jaati he
 This epic has ended in 17 cantos, but the folk belief is that only the first canto is composed of Kalidas
 baad ke anya nau sarg anya kavi kii rachana he
 Some people believe that the poem ends in eight cantos only with the premonition of Kumar's birth with Shivparvati Samagam
 kuch log kehete hai ki aathven sarg main shivparvati ke sambhog kaa varnan karne ke kaaran kalidas ko kusht ho gaya or ve likh na sake
 There is also a view that his intercourse is not interested in the public, so he did not write further
 isamen varnit katha sankshep main is prakaar he- Parvatraj was the son of Manak of Himalayas and a girl named Gauri
 kanya parvati or uma naam se bhi vikhyath hui
 When Kanya was born, Narada came to her house one day and predicted that the girl would be married to Shiva
 yah bhavishyavaanee sunakar himalay niïshchat ho gaye
 On the other hand, Shiva was doing penance at the peak of the Himalayas
 himalay ne ek sakhi ke saath uma ko unki paricharya ke liye bhej diya or uma bhakthibhaav se shiv kii seva karne lagi
 In those days, the gods were defeated in the battle with Tarakasura
 daitya anek prakaar ke chal karne laga
 Then all the gods including Indra came to Brahma
 tarakasur ke nimit yogya senapati kii maang kii
 Then the brahura said that only a man born with Shankar's semen can be your worthy general
 isliye tum log prayaas karo jisase shiv parvati ke prati aasakt hon
 If Shiva accepted Parvati, then if you have a son with Parvati, then you will win if you become his commander
 tatpashchaat indradi devtaa shiv ke virakt bhav ko hataane ke upaay par vichaar karne ke liye ekatra hue
 When Madan came to that assembly, Indra requested him to accompany his friend Vasanth to Shiva's austerity place and enchant Shiva with Parvati
 tadnusaar madan apni patni rati or mitra vasant ko lekar shankar ke ashram main pahunchaa
 When Parvati reached near Shiva to offer the garland of Kamalbees and Shiva raised his hand to take her, Madan offered a bow to his bow
 tatkshan shiv kaa man vichlit hua
 Shankar thus looked around to find out the reason for sudden distortion of mind
 unhen sharasandhan karata madan dikhaai padaa
 Shiva became furious after seeing her; Agnijwala appeared from his third eye and Madan consumed him
 rati apane pati ko is prakaar bhasma hote dekh vilaap karne lagi or vasant se chita taiyaar karne ko kaha or swayan praan tyaagane ko taiyaar hui
 Then there was a voice in the air that you should regain your patience
 udhar shiv narisampark se bachane ke liye antardhan ho gaye
 With Madan being consumed and Shiva being impregnated, Parvati saw all her desires fail and thinking that this beauty is futile, she went to a mountain peak to appease Shiva and started doing intense penance
 kuch kaal ke ananthar shiv kaa man pighla unhone parvati ko sweekaar karne kaa vichaar kiya
 But before that he decided to test Parvati and he reached the ashram of an ascetic
 parvati ne atithi ke rup main unka samuchit satkar kiya
 Then the Tarun ascetic inquired of Parvati, for whom she was doing such austere penance
 atithi ke prashn ko sunakar parvati lajjit hui or apane manobhaav prakat karne main sankoch karne lagi tab unki sakhi ne shiv kii prapti kii ichha kii baat kahi
 Hearing this, the ascetic Shiva, condemning him by mentioning Shiva's fortifications and ugliness etc
 parvati ko yah shiv ninda nahin hui or unhe daantne lagi
 Shiva then appeared in his form and held his hand
 tatpashchaat shiv ne saptarshi ke bulaakar himalay ke paas bheja
 He told them that Shiva had expressed his desire to take Parvati's accession
 tab vivaah kaa nishchay hua or vivaah kii taiyaari hone lagi
 The Saptamatrikas brought the groom's clothes, but Shiva did not accept them all and walked on Nandi
 pashchaat vivaah kii sari kriyaayein hui
 Upon completion of the marriage, Parvati, including Shiva, bowed to the Brahmin
 brahri ne aashirwad diya
 You are a brave son
 apsaraon ne aakar var-vadhu ke sammukh ek naatak prasttut kiya
 After the play ends Indra requests Shiva to bring Madan alive
 ant main shiv or parvati ke ekant milan kii charchaa vistaar se kii gai he

 Existentialists give more importance to the existence of a person than to a thought or suffix
 inke anusaar saare vichaar yaa siddhant vyakti kii chintna ke hi parinaam hai
 The first person or person contemplating came into existence, so the person's existence is predominant, while the idea or principle is secondary
 unke vichaar se har vyakti ko apana siddhant swayan khojna yaa bananaa chahie, dusron ke dwaara pratipaadit yaa nirmit siddhanton ko sweekaar karnaa uske liye aavashyak nahin
 Due to this approach, all traditional, social, moral, classical and scientific theories prove to be invalid or impractical for them
 unka maananaa he ki yadi ham dukh evam mrityu kii anivaaryta ko sweekaar kar len to bhay kahan rah jaataa he
 According to the existentialist, grief and depression should be accepted as essential and functional elements of life
 paristhitiyon ko sweekaar karnaa yaa na karnaa vyakti kii hi ichha par nirbhar he
 According to them, a person realizes his condition in a state of grief or tragedy, so he should be present to welcome that situation

 By understanding the basic subject, he wanted to define existentialism and he was successful in it to some extent
 Logos is a Greek word whose pure 'forms are' meaning I
 Logotherapy is based on the existence of a human being and the search for the meaning of man
 On the basis of logotherapy, the pursuit of meaning in life is the first motivating force of a human being
 That is why Frankl has given the importance of life to high importance
 Not Anand
 manushya ke arth ke khoj kii dhara main hataasha yaa niraashaa kaa bhi bahut bada bhaag hota handi logotherapy ne ise astitv kuntha kaa naam diya handi ‘astitv’ shabd ko teen tareeke se upyog main daalaa ja saktaa handi astitv jo apane aap main arth hai yani manushya ke jivan kaa aadharani astitv kaa arth, vyaktigat astitv main thos arth ke khoj kaa prayasi is hataasha kaa parinaam neurosis bhi ho saktaa handi victor i frankal apane marijon ke takalif dwaara ek bahut bade prashn ko uthaate hai jo aaj ke jivan main sabaki durbalata kaa kaaran ban chuki hai, vah hai zindagi main arthhinata kaa pravasdai aisi takalif adhiktar un logo main dekhi gayi jo mrityu shivi se batch niklequi in logo main zindagi ko jeene ki utsukata hi nahin rahiqui unke zehan main khokhlaapan hi rahaa kyunki ve aatanrik akelepan se guzarate handi is khoklepan yaah akelepan ko jisase har insaan jhujhata hai use victor i frankal ne astitv vaakum kaa naam diyani Existence Vacuum is a phenomenon that has become very famous in the twentieth century
 The beginning of the existential condition comes from sadness
 On this occasion, Frankel makes it clear about 'sunday Neurosis'
 It is a kind of depression in which a person has satisfaction in his life
 He feels the deficiency and realizes this when he feels the loneliness of his life after a week of parting
 Accordingly, the causes of drunkenness and juvenile delinquency cannot be understood until it recognizes the existence of a suppressed existence
 The same applies in the case of old people and pensioners
 These survival laws hold different disguises and life
 Are presented to human beings in different aspects of life
 Some of these may be the desire for power or the desire for money which in search of meaning can be done by man Week tend to blur i are the result of existential frustrations that sexual libido logotherapy kii koshish hameshaa yahi rahati hai ki marijon ko puri tarah se apane kartavya ke taraf modaa jaekai taaki vah yah samaj sake ki ve kiske liye, kis liye or kyon kartavya se bandhe hue handi frankal kaa yah kahana hai ki jivan kaa vaastavik arth swayan ke maanas main nahin balki sansar main handi usee tarah maanav ke astitva kaa asli uddeshy aatm parichay se nahin hotaryi uskaa saar aatm shreshtataa se praapt hoti handi frankal is baat ko nyaay siddh karne ke liye tark yah laate hai ki aatm parichay kabhi bhi jivan kaa aadhaar nahin ban saktaa kyunki maanav jitna use paane kaa praytn karegaa vah utana usko khoyegaqui The world should never understand the manifestation of self, nor is the world the only means to achieve self-introduction
 This implies that the meaning of life is not constant, but it does not have any ends
 Life under logotherapy we Can be found in three ways: through karma; By experiencing the value of one's Vastu; It is very beneficial to complete the first method
 Through pain, there is a need for re-expansion in the second and third ways
 This education can be given to us by nature or by culture or by experiencing someone, ie through love
 Love itself is a shield through which a person's inner personality can be watered
 No one can know a human being or Can understand until love is born
 If love is put in spiritual form, then it can see other important signs of human beings
 Not, the man whom she loves very big step i even more the way of self-introduction, which is confirmed that their power i will go two men recognize their power i teesraa tarika jo manushya ko apane jivan ke arth ko khojane main sahaayta karata hai vah he peedaashi manushya jab bhi asahaay yaa aisi paristhiti se guzarataa he jiskaa parinaam unke haath main na ho jaise: koi laailaaj beemaari, usee vakt ek insaan ko apni pahchaan ko bodh karnaa kaa bharpoor mauka miltaa he, arthath ksht ko jhelkar jivan kaa sabase bada arth paane kaa avasar miltaa handi isamen ksht ki taraf vyakti kaa nazariyaa bhi peeda ko jhelane ki takat detaa haii Frankel, Victor E

 In this situation, the reason for not taking action is to be recorded in the log book, which also has to be given to the person in front
