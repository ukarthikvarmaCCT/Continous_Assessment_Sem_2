jin dinon kii yah baat he, un dinon har mulaakaat ke samay ek jumala unki jubaan par hota tha—‘dil milen na milen, haath milaate rahiye
’ upar maine aparichay kaa zikr kiya he
 It is also important that whenever the moment of acquaintance with Suranjan was seen deepening, a distance always remained in my mind
 There is always a warning located in any corner of the mind that there is a taboo area ahead from here
 yahi tumhaari lakshmanarekha he
 It is possible that i have had some frustration or weakness
 That childhood rites


 the tendency to maintain a safe distance between relationships, which has become a part of my nature, now and now
 suranjan ne bhi apane liye is prakaar kii lakshmanarekhaayen khinch rakhi hai, pataa nahin
 lekin itnaa tay he ki unke or unki lakshmanarekhaon ke bich nishchit rup se adhik faasla he
 Which gives them relatively more opportunity to become intimate with their acquaintances
 mujhe lekar suranjan ke man main kitne faasale hai isse to parichay nahin, lekin ek baat main jor dekar kah saktaa hum ki itane varshon main shaayad hi koi aisa avasar aayaa ho, jab koi itani oonchi diwaar hamaare bich bani ho, jisko laangh paanaa naammumkin ho
 aparichay ko daur main bhi parichay ko kaayam karne kii lalak kamobesh donon taraf bani rahi
 is tarah yah abuch-avaanchit aparichay hi he, jisane hamaare parichay kii nirantarata ko banaae rakhane main madad kii he
 Suranjan is a litterateur
 kavita-kahani-upanyaas-baalsahitya sabakuch likhaa he unhone
 kavita ho yaa gadhy, unhone unheen vishyon par kalamghasiti kii he, jinhen swayan bhoga yaa anubhoot kiya he
 He also has a rough novel 'mandi House: This is me'
 anubhuti atyant teevr, saghan or dhardaar ho to kavita
 kuch uthali, ukhdi-ukhdi-si ho to kahani yaa upanyaas
 haalanki bhoomika ke dauraan subhash chander ne ‘mandi house


’ kii prashansa kii he
 But i do not like his novels
 i believe that Suranjan is basically a poet, so there is no adequate development of the plot in his story-novels
 The pressure to uphold the authenticity of cognition from above, as well as personal experiences, makes the composition cumbersome and unreadable
 swanubhuti ke dabaav kaa shikaar unki kavitaayen bhi hai
 Suranjan does not know how to hide
 Perhaps they have not learned this trick
 unke kavi kaa dard, puure jamaane kaa dard he, ve aksar yahi dikhaate rahete hai
 As a creator, the whole world of Suranjan is confined in two mines
 pehle khaane main ve hai, jinhen ve apana maanate hai, jinase ve pyaar karte hai
 In the second, they are those who have resentment towards them
 atev unki rachanaaon main aksar vahi paatr aate hai, jinhen vah apane jivan main taatkaalik rup se sweekaarya athwa asweekaarya pate hai
 The intensity of cognition creates pressure for writing, so that they constantly create something
 kintu niztaa ke atyadhik dabaav main unki rachanaaen nijee aakrosh, kuntha yaa khunnas kii abhivyakti kaa madhyam ban jaati hai
 Suranjan's prose is also for poetry
 isse unki rachanaaon main laalitya swaabhaavik rup se ubhar aata he
 But sometimes this leads to relaxation of the story's dynamics, which is an equally necessary condition for readability
 isi kaaran suranjan ko gadhy se adhik shoharat unki kavitaaon se mili he
 Suranjan is also satisfied with this
 vaise unke upanyaas ‘mandi house: yah main hum main’ kaa sheershak mujhe iske kathanak se adhik pyaara laga
 haalanki jaisaa maine pehle bataaya, yah suranjan kii swanubhuti kaa hi khelaa he
 a simple autobiographical novel in which he has seen what he has come across
 vahi naripatr hai jo jinase suranjan kii bhaawanaaon kii duniya basii he
 Everything, reality, sex, sensations etc
 are there in the novel
 lekin aatmakathaatmak rachanaaen jis tatasthta or nirmam aatmvishleshan kii maang karti hai, vah is upanyaas main kahin nahin he
 In fact, this is also the limit of Suranjan
 atisamvedansheeltaa kaa lakshan hota he ki vah dimag ko ek daayre se baahar nahin jane detii
 aisi sthiti main aatmshlagha bhi aa jude to kriti kaa sahitya-tatv sankat main pad jaataa he
 a victim of self-immolation sees the world divided into two parts
 ek jo uske kaam kii he
 Helps in his self-interest
 duusari jisase sirf dusron kaa hitsaadhan sambhav he
 Since sensations are intense impulses of the mind, they are also moment-to-moment variable
 aisi avasthaa main doston or dushmani ke daayre bhi ekajaise nahin rah pate
 ve bhi apni dhuriyaan badalte rahete hai
 That is, a person who is a friend in a particular moment can also come under the realm of enmity in a particular moment
 or dushmano kii qatari main shaamil vyakti kisi bhi pal dost bhi ban saktaa he
 Overconfidence makes a person autistic and sometimes cruel, which has to bear the brunt of the person
 suranjan kaa upanyaas ‘mandi house


’ mujhe is desh ke loktantr kii takat kaa roopak jaan padataa he
 Mandi House and the area around it is the most preferred destination of the capital's cultural workers
 yahaan rajdhani or baahar se aae samskruthikarmiyon, sahityakaron kaa jamabada laga hi rahata he
 Therefore, calling this zone as the cultural capital of Delhi does not seem to be an exaggeration
 Let me tell you that Suranjan has written this novel sitting in the park of Mandi House, in the parks here
 un dinon jo unke kathitam sangharsh ke din the
 Getting out of home empty stomach, reaching Mandi house and chatting with friends till evening, writing in leisure time
 If you feel hungry then eat whatever you get
 Putting the scorn of your lonely life on paper through rafta-rafta pen i think a disillusioned, resourceless, under-educated and passionate Kalamakar from an ordinary town in remote Bihar, who wanted to challenge the cultural establishments, with the help of a few snooters and opportunists, bureaucrats, with just a pen, without any godfather
 And have become the den of corrupt people
 jinke liye sahitya or samskruti mahaj mandi main pahunche hua ‘maal’ hai
 Simple products, whose utility is limited to earning money
 unhen bechakar adhikadhik munafa kamanaa unke liye maanviya sarokaaron ke kisi bhi prashn se adhik ahm he
 Suranjan gives a challenge to those roots establishments by the title of this novel
 kah sakate hai ki yah aadhunik swaarthee or vyaktikendrit sattakendron ko ek swabhimani, sangharkshil or aatmavishvaas se labarej sahityakar kii ore se ek chunauti he
 There is a defiance, from the sensitive penman
 Suranjan is also quite ruthless in many cases
 yah nirmamata jitani dusron ke liye apane liye bhi kuch kam nahin he
 Especially when it comes to writing
 Sometimes even innocent and uninteresting things are said so innocently that even their enemy gets angry
 haalanki aakrosh se suranjan ko hi nuksaan pahunchaa he
 This has hampered his creativity
 gusse main vyakti apane shreshthatam ko nahin de paata
 unki adhikansh kavitaayen akelepan kii kahani kahatee, khud ko baar-baar doharaati hai
 Most of them were written when he was struggling in his room, away from home and family, lonely, forgetting himself
 suranjan kii behtareen kavitaayen bhi vahi hai, jo unke ghaney nairashyabodh or pidaaon se janmi hai
 Almost broken by the desperation of the day, which he has created by drowning within himself
 unamem jindagi se bhaag jane kaa utavlaapan he to uske prati behad lagaav bhi
 aantarik sangharsh kii yahi sthiti suranjan kii kavitaaon main jhini darshaniktaa ke saath upasthit hui he
 Which passes close to existentialism
 pidaa ke saath suranjan ke kavi kaa sangaman kisi fishan ke tahat nahin hua he, jaisaa ki hamaare adhikansh kavi karte rahete hai
 Suranjan's poems have the deceitful pain of giving him asmit
 isliye jab vah kehete han ki suranjan kavita ko pahentaa, odhata-bichhaata he to isamen kuch bhi atishyoktipurna nahin lagata
 duusare kaviyon kii tarah suranjan bada kavi hone kaa daawa karne ke bajaay apni sarjana main leen hone, uske prati ekatm ho jane main hi apana badppan maanate hai
 The sense of immersion in one's own genre is to be assimilated by that genre in other words
 yah kisi bhi samarpit kalamkaar kaa dhyey ho saktaa he
 Suranjan has been able to achieve this goal, it is also proved by his behavior
 unki kuch bhavoddeepak kavitaaon ko padhate hue mujhe angreji ke kavi pi bi style ke yaad aa jaati he
 i have been witness to some of Suranjan's struggles
 He has sold many papad to live life
 prakaashan se lekar dukandaaree tak
 sahityarath se lekar swapn rath


or phir ek ke baad ek naukari, pruf reeding, in dinon kathasansar se jude hai
 There is also a shop cutting time
 vahi unka prakaashan he, vahi priting house
 or kahen to steshnari kii footkar dukaan bhi he
 But the discomfort still remains as it is
 darasal kisi vyavsaay ko jamaane ke liye hunar chahie vah suranjan main nadaarad he
 He dreams, but is unaware of the skill of turning him into a business
 aaj jab har kshetra main spardhaa he, log sapane nahin parinaam kii maang karte hai, sapane dekhnaa ek reetikalin shauk hi kaha ja saktaa he
 Through Kathasanasar, i have also come to know about many new aspects of Suranjan
 unhen agar ched duun to baat khinchati chali jaaegi
 kuchhek prasang kaagaj par utarane ko jarur utaavle hai
 Perhaps readers are also interested in them
 Some part of Suranjan's arbitrariness will come out through these episodes
 i have also been associated with the publication of the early issues of Kathasanasar
 i wished, and perhaps renewed enthusiasm, which has no relation to the ground of practicality, to the reality from which the publisher and editor have to be twice daily to run the magazine
 So i wanted the magazine to develop its independent character
 Such an attempt was also made in the first few digits
 Suranjan himself was also very enthusiastic
 isliye unhone kuch aisi rachanaaen lekh dhund nikaale jo purv prakashit hone ke baavjood samasamyikta kii kasuti par khare utarate the
 There was a lot of discussion on them after publication
 un dinon suranjan jis kathin sangharsh se guzar rahe the, unke liye roji-roti kaa sawaal sabase aham tha
 Which he was looking to solve through the Kathasanasar
 sampadak or lekhak bhi insaan hote hai or unki kuch jaruratein bhi hoti hai, yah dekhte hue isamen kuch bhi galat nahin tha
 Questions of morality are often buried in stomach hunger
 to bhi mujhe bharosa tha ki kaviman suranjan apane dhairya ko chukne nahin denge
 ve roji-roti ke baaki raaston ko aajamaane ke baad patrika ke kshetra main aae the
 He also found them very easy
 shaayad samay bhi unke saath tha
 Hence, the title 'kathasansar' was also registered
 If there was competition in the field of literary magazine, then the chances of success on doing better work were not less
 mujhe bhi lagata tha ki yadi patibaddhta ke saath patrika nikaali jaae to vah pathakaan ke man main dhire-dhire apni paith bana hi legi
 jo prakarantar main apane charitra ke anuroop nayaa pathakvarg gadhane main sakasham hogi
 jaahir he ki meraa yah thodaa-bahut aadarshatmak soch tha, jiskaa vaastaviktaa se koi naata hi nahin tha
 The daily problems of life did not bother me as much as they kept Suranjan distracted
 patrika nikali magar kuch to jaruratein or kuch ve duraagrah jo suranjan kii aatmashlagha kii upaj the, in sabane kathasansar ko us patari se utaar diya, jisapar daudane kii baat use aarambh karte samay sochi gai thi
 However, Kathasanasar is Suranjan's magazine and he will have to be as he would like
 Before starting the story, i used to think that Suranjan lacked professional skills
 patrika nikaalane ke aarambhik daur main unhone jo ek ke baad ek kadam uthaae the, unamem mili asafalataa dekhakar meri yah dharna bani thi
 His Magadha publication was also often stalled
 dukandaaree ve kar nahin sakate the
 And Sahityaratha had to return to Gaya after getting sold
 ye asafalataaen darshaati thim ki ve vyavsaayik nipunata, kam se kam vanijyik kaushal se pare hai
 But through Kathasanasar my confusion like other people was broken
 Suranjan's shrewdness as an editor 


 was like a consummate editor
 yah vyaavhaarikta kaa hi atirek tha ki stri samathrya ke prati bina kisi nishtha yaa patibaddhta ke kathasansar ke ‘strishakthi visheshank’ kii ghoshnaa kar di jaae
 usee ank main ek vivaadit tippanee, ki stri ko to purush ke neeche hi rahanaa he,’ bhi sampakadiya kaa hissaa banakar aae
 is vaktavy par jinhen chubhan hoti he, hoti rahe, kisi kaa ji dukhata he to dukhe, suranjan ko isaki chintaa nahin
 unki pravriti aag lagaakar majaa lenevaali to nahin he, magar us ghatana main aisa hi hua tha
 There was also heavy criticism of the magazine
 But there was no significant difference on Suranjan with the arrival of some sixteen lover writers
 This is why he wanted to capitalize on the boil in the nationalist sentiments that emerged during the Kargil war, like other market forces, through the magazine's war specials
 unheen dinon arundhati raay ke naam lanaan puraskaar kii ghoshnaa hui
 america ke ford foundation kii ore se mili is puraskaar ko arundhati saamaajik sanghathanon or vibhinn patrikaon main baant detii hai
 As soon as she gets the news, she becomes the 'best girl in the world' for Suranjan
 chunki duniya kii sabase acchhee ladki suranjan kii kavita pustak kaa sheershak bhi he
 a cult couple, Suranjan also brings his poetry book into the discussion with an attempt to please Arundhati
 stri visheshank ke sampadakeey main vah stri-asmita ke viruddh or bhi talkh tippaniyan dete hai
 And such arguments in support of your point that you just keep on nodding your head
 i have been a fan of Suranjan's outspoken, uninteresting things
 That editorial of Kathasanasar was itself a multi-thread series of contradictions
 par iske madhyam se sarthak vimarsh aarambh karne ke bajaay suranjan kii koshish is bahaane patrika ko vivaadon main le aane kii thi
 He also expected from the material that came for publication, that there would be something to check
 He often used to say this at the time of meeting writers or urging them to create
 vivaad ke madhyam se logon kaa dhyanakarshan karne or dhanalabh kaa sapana dekhne waalon main suranjan akele nahin hai
 There are many such editor-litterateurs in Hindi, who keep stirring up the crowd by throwing stones in the crowd
 suranjan bhi unheen main se ek hai
 But in this case they are a little clumsy than others
 Probably because they don't play big games
 The clever players in this game are out of their reach
 choti-choti khushiyon ke samaan choti-choti chaalaakiyon se hi ve santusht ho lete hai
 It is the habit of every passionate poet-writer, but not of Suranjan alone, to get carried away with small things
 main yah kah chukaa hum ki suranjan mul rup se kavi hai
 And i have also been a fan of passionate poetry, a reader of his poetry
 But sentimentality does not allow ideological relevance to flourish
 In such a situation, Suranjan's cleanliness acts as a shield for him
 ham unki raay se sahamat-asahmat ho sakate hai
 But Suranjan has to be praised for this, that people like us who deal with people with many masks, Suranjan has much less masks than us
 jitne hai unka bhi vah bahut samajhadaari yaa kahen ki chaturipurvak upyog nahin kar pate
 suranjan kii spashtvaadita unhen hamaari apeksha nirmely siddh karti he
 It is not even a strange or unnatural situation in view of the struggle he has gone through
 apni jid or sanak ke kaaran suranjan ne nuksaan bhi kam nahin uthaaya he
 Their craze has been behind the repeated desolation and settling
 isi kaaran vah naukari paane or chhodane kaa khel bhi khelte rahete hai
 Perhaps this is why his life-struggle was stretched so long
 Even today, the story which he has helped to restore him, has increased his popularity, no one knows when he will be engaged in the creation of a new world
 Where does Suranjan himself know this? unke isi swabhaav ko parakhte hue varisht laghukthakaar jagadish kashyap ne suranjan ko phinics pakshi kii upama di thi
 This mythological character of Greek folklore has been able to regain life from the ashes of his own pyre
 bhartiya aakhyaanon main iske samanaantar raktbeej jaise myth rahe hai
 According to Suranjan's personality, the exact metaphor cannot be in my eyes
 There are many things to say about Suranjan
 aath-das varshon ke antaraal main saath-saath bhoge gaye kai mahatvapurn, yaadgaar kshan hai
 i have got to learn a lot from them
 Especially the understanding of spelling
 i used to make a lot of mistakes while writing those days
 Although i was a Masters in Philosophy and he barely passed seven-eight Jamaat
 Despite this, i have no hesitation in saying that Suranjan had more knowledge than literature and writing
 unase sutara rup main anek ve baaten jaanane ko milin jo aaj bhi bahut kaam aa rahi hai
 If i have been able to make a place in the literary world today, then the contribution of friends like Suranjan is no less behind it
 is aalekh ke antim hisse main main suranjan ke us hisse par tippanee karnaa chaahunga jiske kaaran vah jab tab vivaadon ko aamantrit karte rahete hai
 In the simultaneous conversation, he has introduced his life-struggle piece by piece
 jaanata hum ki jitna mujhe bataaya he, usase kai guna unhone bhoga he
 As much as he has told me, the amount of exaggeration is minimal
 shaayad aate main namak jitani
 suranjan kii khubi he ki aise maamalon main vah ascharyajanak rup se eemaandaaree se pesh aate hai, to bhi unke jivan ke gai gudh prashn aise hai, jinke bare main mere man main sadaiv jigyaasa rahi he
 But he never dared to talk to Suranjan about them
 But i know that whenever those questions are discussed, their honesty will remain with us
 It is impossible for Suranjan to be discussed and not to talk about sex
 uske vyaktitv kaa yahi aisa pahalu he, jiske bare main kamobesh sabhi jaanate hai
 His partner as well as critic
 In this case, everyone's opinion is almost the same
 khud suranjan is bare main kabhi kuch nahin chhipate
 sambhavat is mudde par ve sabase adhik mukhar hote hai
 Regardless of anyone
 Often i think that there is such a crooked gland in Suranjan's psyche
 vahi unhen achaanak uksaakar aadi-tirchhi chaal chalane ko vivash kar detii he
 When that gland can force which move, its special friends are not able to assess it
 i think that drops, a long snake, his poems like creation, are not the creations of the ordinary poet's mind
 ve isi ukasaav granthi kii dein hai, jisaki ore maine upar sanket kiya he
 They are also the product of deformed Kamakunthas, which are engulfed deep in the mind of Suranjan
 jinaki thaah paanaa mujh jaise saadhaaran kalamkaar ke bas main nahin
 lekin ye kunthaayen kisi ek din main viksit nahin hui hai
 Nor can they be planted in their psyche
 balki ye us kathin sangharsh kaa parinaam hai jo suranjan ne ghar-parivaar se barason dur, ekaaki rahakar bhoga he
 They are a failure of those circumstances, which have tested their every moment in the days of hard struggle and have clung to their personality
 magar inke kaaran unhen koi nafrat se dekhe yaa ochhepan kaa aarope lagaae, yah suranjan to suranjan mujhe bhi acha nahin lagegaa
 balki inke kaaran suranjan ham sab kii sahanubhuti anayas hi bator le jate hai
 Because what they endured is extraordinary
 suranjan kii kunthaon, jo unki kavitaaon main ashleelata kii had tak vyakt hui hai, ke antahsthalon kii padtaal karnaa mujhe ek chunauti saamaan lagata he
 Sometimes i feel that Suranjan can be a great case for work-disorders researchers
 jiske adhyayan ke jariye maanavaman kii kuch nai antahrachanaaon tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 In which the role of Suranjan's lone deviation and endless struggle has been played
 kalpana kiijie ki ek yuva kuch varsh kaa safal daanpaty jeene ke baad achaanak khud ko akelaa paata he
 a youth whose mind is full of romanticism
 mukesh or lata ke dard-bhare nagamon main jisko apni duniya najar aati he
 And who wants to live life with the same romanticity
 aisa bhavuk insaan apane akelepan, bhukh, bekaari, garibi or saadhanheenata ke saath akelaa jujhataa he
 Except for the tragic sensations of childhood that have no past
 mahanagar main jiskaa koi apana nahin
 jiske paas puunji he to sirf apni bhavukta or samvednaaon kii
 usee ke madhyam se apane pairon ke neeche kii jameen talashta hua vah sudur bihar se desh kii rajdhani pahunchataa he
 With countless dreams in his eyes
 With some unsuccessful love stories
 His memory drowns, even in the concrete jungle, where is the rest for him? Skyscrapers do not give shade to such idols
 On the contrary, she starts to realize his dwarfness
 rajdhani pahunchakar bhi uskaa antaheen sangharsh viraam nahin miltaa
 Such a lost person needs the support of someone, with the woman in such moments would do amritavarsha
 Gives the ability and new life to cope with the circumstances
 But he has already lost it
 dainik aavashyaktaaon ko usne sharaab or bhaang ke nashe ke neeche dabaane kii koshish kii
 par kya aisa sambhav tha
 If it is a matter of one or two days then it is fine There, month after month, year after year, the same room was lonely
 jo ghadi-ghadi deh ko kachotata
 pal-pal dank martha
 taane-ulahne detaa
 aisi jodi bahon se duusari jodi bahon tak jane main suranjan ko chaidah baras lage
 ram ke vanvaas main to sita unke saath thim
 If they are not, then who can say how much their valor rises
 itane lambey antaraal main kamanaayen vikrut na hon to kaise? duusari baar baahaa kaa sahaara to mila, par man kaa vishwaas nahin
 isliye yah kam nahin ki aise vikat jhanjhawaton se din-raat jujhane ke baavjood suranjan toote nahin
 kavita rupi sanjivani ne unhen bikharane se bachaae rakhaa
 ek kavi jo behad bhavuk he
 Live in constant wishes
 chalate-chalate sapane dekhtaa he
 Who has the wealth of poetry
 or jo ek ke baad ek kai asafal premakathaon se guzar kar bhi niraash nahin hua he
 That is, one who sees a new love rising in dreams
 uske liye sapanom kaa tootna or bikharana kitna mahattch rakhata he
 We are people who live a simple, bonded life
 us jivan kii bhayavahata ke bare main haragij nahin soch sakate
 or yadi kalpana bhi karne lagen to dimag kii sari nasen fatne ko ho aati hai
 But Suranjan has faced them all
 ek do din nahin, varshon, varsh akele-akele
 har din til-til jalte-bujhate
 aaj jis suranjan ko ham jaanate hai, vah lambey sangharsh or bhaawanaaon kii lapaton main tapakar niklaa he
 There is unevenness in him, so whenever we try to know Suranjan separately, his life will give some detail to human understanding
 Suranjan's previous poems recount his long struggles and frustrations
 jinamein vishaad or karunaa kii sahaj prastuti he
 Those poems are enough to prove him a natural-looking poet
 kintu uski haal kii kavitaayen khaastaur par sampadak suranjan kii kavitaaon main aavegatmak prem kaa sthaan foohadpan or ashleelata ne le liya he
 Female characters previously used to play the religion of inspiration in their poems
 parantu ab unke varnan main ashleelata saaf jhalkane lagi he
 The wish of getting the best girl in the world is still in his mind today
 par jis stri ko vah apni patni kehete hai, usko ankashayini banane ke baavjood uske prati man main saikadon shankaaen paale rahete hai
 Poems in which women used to show a spontaneous love towards characters, now there is a feeling of resentment and complaint towards the wife
 jo kavitaayen pehle komal bhaawanaaon ko badi saumyatapurvak saheje rakhti thim, aajkal unamem foohadpan or ashleelata he
 By reading his poems nowadays, sometimes it comes to mind that i wish i could arrange a life-size mirror, from which a glimpse of human conscience can be clearly seen
 i would put that mirror in front of Suranjan's eyes
 At the time when he shows unjustified anger towards his wife
 yaa unpar tarah-tarah ke aarope lagaate hai
 At that time, i would try to read her eyes staring, when she was watching Vikas and v together
 If Suranjan was given at that time, then i would definitely ask a question, why the eyes of the year-old year-old eyes are filled with neglect towards development? Why is there a difference of ground and sky between the two? Asks that Suranjan, who remembers Pancham again and again in his poem, who struggles day and night for the betterment of his life, and who is worried every moment for his future, Suranjan and the ideal father, face to face with his second and great child
 Why are you turned around? pancham ke liye ek momdil pita vikaas ke liye pathar samaan kathor kyon ho jaataa he
 i agree that these are personal allegations
 duusare ke jivan main naahak hastkshep kii koshish hai
 Literature allows it to be so personal
 We assume that every person has a private life and writers are no exception
 vyakti kii niztaa main avaanchit taakazank karnaa ashisht hi nahin, paap jaisaa he
 Believe it, while writing all this, i have no intention of enjoying gratification
 These words are no less painful for me
 parantu isse bhi adhik pidaa mujhe un kavitaaon ko lekar hoti he, jinamein ve apane ghar-parivaar ko jabaran le aate hai
 Since Suranjan publicizes his privacy on his own and does it with pride, wants to rob his condolences by bringing himself among the readers, he should also prepare them for the questions arising from him
 Thinking that he has the gift of expression
 ve apni pidaa ko kaagaj par utaar sakate hai
 They continue to take off
 parantu is aadan-pradaan main doosraa paksh to puri tarah maun he
 So as a litterateur, it is also Suranjan's job to give justice and full expression to that party
 yadi vah aisa nahin karte to nijee pidaaon ke bazareekaran or dusron kii sahanubhuti-samvednaaon ke mol bechney kaa aarope unpar lagate hi rahenge
 log aamane-saamne nahin to peeth peeche kahenge
 chup vahi rahenge jo mahaj tamashbin honge
 chalate-chalate suranjan kii sapanili paardarshee ankhon kaa ullekh chhod duun to man main kuch karakata sa rahegaa
 mujhe unamem hajaar-hajaar sapane har pal tairte hue najar aate hai
 Since Suranjan has uncountable dreams, his imagery of saffron keeps on smelling every moment, so no one is able to keep his mind in mind
 He becomes silent after putting all his agony, frustration, evil and bad thinking on paper
 yahi unke angadh vyaktitv kii visheshta he
 This is the boon that Suranjan has received from nature along with poetry
 or shaayad yahi vah kaaran he suranjan agar saamne haa to man unke prati naapsandgi kaa izhaar karata he, parantu jab vah dur ho to yaadon ke daravaaje par baar-baar sir patakekar baichaiyn kiye rakhte hai

 Transmission of power from the generator to the user site is called transmission
 adhikansh sthanon main vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan uske upyogsthalon se dur hota he
 While the transmission of electric power from the generator to the user site is called transmission, the practical meaning of the term is often related to distance and high bolt
 preshan line pole athwa minaaron par aropit, upree linon ke rup main bhi tathaa bhumigat cabilon ke rup main bhi hoti hai
 The upper lines are usually made of copper wire, but aluminum and steel and aluminum composite conductors are also widely used
 adhikansh sthanon main vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan uske upyogsthalon se dur hota he
 Public places are established, in fact, on the basis of achievement of means and economic justification
 jalavidyutgharon ko kisi vishisht sthaan par bana dene kaa prashn hi nahin uthta, kyoki unka sthaan to prakritik sadhano par nirbhar karata he jo saadharantaya ghani aabaadeewale kshetron se dur hote hai
 The installation of thermal power stations also depends on the achievement of the coal as well as the problem of transportation and its transportation
 at: bahudhaa janitrasthalon kii duuri bhaar se kai sau mile bhi ho sakati he or aisi dashaon main preshan linon dwaara shakti ko bhaar tak pahunchaana hota he
 Therefore, remittance is as much an important and important part of the power industry as is the production of power itself
 vaise to janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak vidyutsakti ko le janaa hi preshan kehalaata he, parantu is shabd kaa vyaavhaarik arth bahudhaa duuri tathaa ucch boltata se sambandhit he
 The transmission lines are superimposed on poles or minarets, also as overhead lines and also as underground cables
 upree line saadharantaya taanbe ke taar kii hoti hai, parantu aluminium tathaa ispaat or aluminium ke sanyukt chaalak bhi vistrut rup se prayukt kiye jate hai
 The upper lines should be at least 20 feet above the ground level and no part of it should be at a lower elevation
 bhoomi se inaki oonchaai, ucch voltata kii dasha main or bhi adhik hoti he
 Therefore these lines are carried on the poles and charged on the insulators of the porcelain
 adhik shakti preshan karanevaale, mote chaalkon kii line pole ke sthaan par badi badi minaaron par le jaai jaati hai, jo chaalak sankhya tathaa unpar laganevaale balon ke anusaar vibhinn akruti kii bani hoti he
 The insulators are also of different types and mainly belong to different classes according to their position and voltage
 is prakaar vidyutarodhi 440 volt kii alp voltata se lekar 11 kilovolt, 33 kilovolt, 66 kilovolt ityadi virgon ke hote hai or sthiti ke anusaar vidyutarodhi shaikal, pin, discs tathaa nilamban praroop ke hote hai, jo vibhinn sthitiyon main prayukt kiye jate hai
 The insulators are usually mounted on the pole with scissors and are configured so that in any case the driver does not touch the swinging, the other driver, or the pole, or any of its structural components
 inaki akruti evam rachana bhi is prakaar kii hoti he ki kisi bhi paristhiti main chaalak tathaa pole ke kisi sanrachana anshak ke bich chaalak kaa sandhaaran kar saken
 Cables can be called, in fact, any insulating conductor, but the cables used for the transmission of power are mainly used underground
 at: cabilon kii rachana bhi aisi hoti he ki ve bhoomi ke andar padanevaale prabhaavon se surakshit rah saken
 Generally, the transmission cables are triangular
 at: uname kam se kam teen crode haate hai, jo alag-alag vidyut-ruddha haate hai or phir upar se bhi unpar doosraa vidyutrodhi lapet diya jaataa he
 It is insulated, usually, of diluted paper, or cotton tape, depending on the square of the working voltage of the cable
 vidyutrodhi kharaab na ho jaae, isliye chaalak crode tathaa achaalak sise kii nalee main, jo nami ko andar nahin jane detii, samaavruth hote hai
 This tube is provided with jute lace to protect it from mechanical damage and an iron leaf shield is provided from above
 is kaaran inhen kavchit cabile bhi kehete hai
 Very high voltage transmission cables are also filled with oil
 tel, vastut:, uttam achaalak madhyam he
 But the design of such cables is quite complex and difficult to take care of
 iske kaaran inkaa upyog simit he
 The austerity of electrification depends to a large extent on the size of the conductor
 chaalak kaa aakaar mukhyat: vahan kii janevaali dhara par nirbhar karata he
 The current to be carried for a given power depends mainly on the voltage
 at: preshan ke liye ucchtam voltata prayog karnaa hi upyukt he, jisase us shakti ke liye vahan kii janevaali dhara kam ho sake or chote aakaar ke chaalak prayukt kiye ja saken
 But even the highest voltage has its limits
 36 kilometre se adhik volttaaon par chaalak kaa aakaar dhara ke pariman par hi nahin, vastut:, korana ke prabhaav par nirbhar karata he
 The corona has the effect of expelling the air around the conductor at high voltages
 iske kaaran him him kii dhwani tathaa chamak utpann hoti he or yah antat: shakti haani ke rup main prakat hoti he
 For this reason, the shape of the driver has to be designed keeping this power loss and its effects in view
 ucchtam volttaaon par preshan linon kaa sanchaar linon se vyatikaran duusari mahatvapurn samasya he
 High voltage transmitting lines cause an interference voltage in the adjacent communication lines, causing communication disturbances, but this interference can be minimized by keeping the communication lines away from the power lines, and many other treatments
 Can be done
 teesri kathinaayee ucch voltata achaalkon tathaa minaaron kii uchit sanrachana kii he, jisase doshi sthitiyaan utpann na ho saken
 At the same time their proper care also becomes a problem
 inke atirikt ucchtam volttaaon par shakti sthayitv mahatvapurn samasya he
 In long lines of very high voltages, power flow is, in effect, limited by power stability
 is kaaran nirdhaarit shakti keval kisi vishisht voltata par vishisht duuri tak hi preshit kii ja sakati he
 Also, the transmission can be the most economical at a specific voltage according to the transmitted power and distance
 ye samasyaayen badi badi yojanaon main bahut mahatvapurn hoti he or preshnatantr kaa abhikalp yojana kaa ek mukhya ang hota he
 The basis of the dispatch system is the weighting survey
 sabase pehle vibhinn sthanon main prastaavit bhaar kaa pariklan kar liya jaataa he or tab unke anusaar upakendron kii sthiti nishchit kii jaati he
 According to the load and distance, the voltage of the transmission and the number of circuits are determined and the path of the proposed lines is determined
 line abhikalp ke praroop evam abhikalp, vidyutrodhiyon kaa praroop or unako lagane kaa yantravinyas tathaa sangrakshantantr kisi bhi yojana ke liye aarthik pahalu sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Successful design of a remittance system is also the most important economic aspect
 preshnatantr kaa safal abhikalp bhi aarthik kasuti par nirbhar karata he
 There are three main components of transmission of a specified power: power, distance and voltage
 kisi bhi preshnatantr kii yojana kaa safal abhikalp in teenon sanghatakon ke upyukt samanvay par nirbhar karata he
 Significant research is being done in the direction of line design, as a result of which the level of electrical resistance is no longer as high as it was 10 years ago
 is prakaar linon ke mulya main baari bachat sambhav ho saki he
 Very high voltages are dispatched, usually for a distance of more than 100 miles
 bahudhaa preshan ke do kramon main karnaa padataa he
 Transmission at very high voltages is usually done from the power station's sub-center to the sub-stations near the center across the utility area, from where the power tax is transmitted to the sub-station of the utility at a medium voltage
 is prakaar ise praathmik evam dwitiyak preshan ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Distributor or feeding lines are carried from the last sub-station to the load, from where individual loads are handled
 saadharantaya janit voltata ko preshan karne ke liye ati ucch volttaaon main roopatarit karnaa hota he
 Consequently, they are also important parts of the dispatch system

 In fact, conservation tips automatically open and separate the guilty division in the event of a defect
 line sangrakshan ke liye upakentre main bahut prakaar ke riley prayukt kiye jate hai
 Common relays settled are overload relays and ground erosion relays

 The soil erosion relays operate in a state of land degradation and connect the culprit line
 or bhi bahut se bhinn bhinn prakaar ke riley prayukt kiye jate hai
 Many relays operate depending on the distance of the fault and many use a pilot wire, however the latest protection mechanism is the carrier protection system
 karier, vastut:, ek ucch aavriti kii tarang ko kehete hai, jo pilot taron par shakti aavriti ke saath hi adhyaropit kar di jaati he
 In the event of a fault, the relay connected to it disengages the line, acting immediately
 karier sangrakshan tantra duusare tantron kii apeksha adhik drutagami he or adhik vishwasaneey bhi he
 But this can only be economically appropriate for high voltage lines
 preshan linon ke abhikalp main tadit sangrakshan kaa praavdhaan karnaa bhi atyant mahatvapurn hota he
 Falling on a lightning line can destroy it and all the equipment attached to it
 isse bachaav ke liye bahut si yuktiyaan prayukt kii jaati he, jinamein mukhyat: bhoomi taar tathaa taditnirodhak kaa praavdhaan he
 The ground wire normally protects the line from the harmful effects of lightning and prevents lightning from falling as far as possible on the line
 taditnirodhak upakentre athwa ant sanrachanaon par lagaae jate hai or tadit ke line par gir jane par us sidhe hi bhooyojit kar dete hai, jisase line athwa saajasja ko kshati nahin pahunchne paati
 All the minarets are properly grounded and their earth resistance is kept very low by making various arrangements

 Remittances are often interlinked as grids, allowing the free flow of power within the grid
 aise grid ati ucch volttaaon par kaary karte hai or sampurna tantra kii voltata tathaa aavriti ek hi hoti he
 The difficulties of control are certainly increased, but the surplus power of any place in the system can be used in other places, where it is needed
 is prakaar bijligharon main atirikt sthapit shakti kaa rakhana aavashyak nahin rah jaataa
 In fact, in large grids, the power of a single power plant, or machine, is not comparable to the power of the entire system and does not particularly affect the functioning of the entire system
 bharat main bhi aise bahut se grid hai, jaise bhakhda grid, ganga jalavidyut grid, sharada grid, di

 Almost all the power transmission is on the alternating current due to the convenience of conversion by transformers from low voltage to high voltage and high to low voltage

 200 rupaye masik kii naukari ko tyagkar maatr 20 rupaye pratimaas par saraswati ke sampadak ke rup main kaary karnaa unke tyaag kaa parichaayak he
 Retired from editing work, Dwivedi came to his village
 atyadhik rugn hone se 21 disambar 1938 ko raibareli main inkaa swargvaas ho gaya
 Mahavirprasad Dwivedi was the first writer of Hindi, who not only did a deep study of his ethnic tradition, but also saw it from a critical point of view
 unhone anek vidhaon main rachana kii
 Along with the genres of poetry, story, criticism, book review, translation, biography, etc
, he not only wrote a large amount in other disciplines like economics, science, history etc
 but also inspired other writers to write in this direction
 dvivedi ji keval kavita, kahani, aalochana aadi ko hi sahitya maanane ke viruddh the
 He used to keep subjects like Economics, History, Archeology, Sociology etc
 within the scope of literature only
 vastutah swadhinata, swadeshi or swaavlamban ko gati dene vaale gyaan-vigyaan ke tamaam aadhaaron ko ve andolit karnaa chaahate the
 For this work, he not only preached but also wrote Manasa, Covenant, Karmana himself
 unhone vedon se lekar panditraj jagannatha tak ke sanskrit-sahitya kii nirantar pravahamaan dhara kaa avagaahan kiya tha evam upyogita tathaa kalatmak yogadan ke prati ek vaigyanik drushti apanaayi thi
 He wrote his first criticism book on the Sanskrit epic Naishadhicharitam of Sriharsha, titled 'naishadcharit Charcha', which is also the first criticism book in Hindi on Sanskrit literature
 phir unhone lagaataar sanskrit-sahitya kaa anveshan, vivechan or moolyankan kiya
 He also made a novel adaptation of some Sanskrit epics in Hindi, among which Kalidas Krat Raghuvansh, Kumarasambhava, Meghdoot, Kiratarajunya are prominent
 sanskrit, brajabhasha or khadi boli main sfoot kavy-rachana se sahitya-sadhana kaa aarambh karne vaale mahavir prasad dvivedi ne sanskrit or angreji se kramash: brajabhasha or hindi main anuwaad-kaary ke alaava prabhoot samalochanatmak lekhan kiya

 hindi bhashaa ke prasar, pathakon ke ruchi parishkar or gyanavardhan ke liye dvivedi ji ne vividh vishyon par anek niabandh likhe
 Dwivedi ji essays can be divided into eight parts from the point of view - literature, life, science, history, geography, industry, craft language, spirituality
 dvivedi ji ne aalochanatmak nibandhon kii bhi rachana kii
 Like the Sanskrit commentators in the field of criticism, he analyzed the merits of the works and adopted the method of refutation
 dvivedi ji saral or subodh bhashaa likhane ke pakshpaati the
 He himself adopted the simple and popular language
 unki bhashaa main na to sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii adhikta he or na urdu-farsi ke aprachlit shabdon kii bharmaar he ve grih ke sthaan par ghar or ucch ke sthaan par unchaa likhnaa adhik pasand karte the
 Dwivedi used Urdu and Persian words in his language without any hesitation, but in this experiment he adopted only the prevalent words
 dvivedi ji kii bhashaa kaa rup purnatah sthit he
 She is pure refined and bound by the rules of grammar
 unka vaakya-vinyas hindi ko prakruti ke anuroop he kahin bhi vah angrezi yaa urdu ke dhang kaa nahin
 There are mainly three forms of Dwivedi's style - dvivedi ji ne naye-naye vishyon par lekhnee chalaai
 As the subject was new and preliminary, Dwivedi introduced him in a simple and comprehensible style
 aise vishyon par lekh likhte samay dvivedi ji ne ek shikshak kii bhaanti ek baat ko kai baar duharaaya he taaki pathakon kii samaj main vah bhalee prakaar aa jaae
 Thus the style of the articles is the introductory style
 hindi bhashaa ke prachlit dosha ko dur karne ke liye dvivedi ji is style main likhte the
 Writing in this style, he gave a mocking reply to the opponents
 yah style ospurn he
 It has fluency and its language is serious
 kahin-kahin yah style ospurn na hokar vyangyatmak ho jaati he
 At such places, there is fainting in words and simplicity in sentences
 'is municipality ke chairman shriman boochaa shah hai
 Millions of rupees of Father Dad's earnings have filled your house
 padhe-likhe aap ram kaa naam hai
 You have been the chairman just because by showing your car to the government, you become brave and remain surrounded by eighty-four sixty-four people
 ' Dwivedi ji has adopted this style in discussing serious literary subjects
 is style ke bhi do rup milte hai
 The first form is found in those articles which have been written to convince the public about a controversial topic
 isamen vaakya chote-chote hai
 Language is simple
 doosraa rup un lekhon main paaya jaataa he jo vidwaanon ko sambodhit kar likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in it are relatively long
 bhashaa kuch clisht he
 for example - hindi sahitya kii seva karne waalon main dvivedi ji kaa vishesh sthaan he
 It is due to Dwivedi ji's unique literature-services that his time is called as Dwivedi era
 1901 gregory calendar kaa ek saadhaaran varsh he
 Mohan Das is a short novel composed by noted Hindi writer Uday Prakash for which he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2010
 suvyavasthit dhwani, jo ras kii sristi kare, sangeet kehalaati he
 Singing, playing and dancing are all three musicals
 sangeet naam in teenon ke ek saath vyavhaar se padaa he
 Singing, playing and dancing are often as old as old men
 bajaane or baaje kii kala aadmi ne kuch baad main khoji-sikhi ho, par gane or naachne kaa aarambh to na keval hazaron balki lakhon varsh pehle usne kar liya hoga, isamen andeh nahin
 Anthem is almost as natural to human as speech
 kab se manushya ne gaanaa prarambh kiya, yah batalaana utana hi kathin he jitna ki kab se usne bolnaa prarambh kiya
 But after a long time, his anthem took shape
 jab swar or lay vyavasthit rup dhaaran karte hai tab ek kala kaa pradurbhaav hota he or is kala ko sangeet, mujeec yaa mausiiki kehete hai
 Humans have been using the playing of songs during war, festivities and prayers or bhajans
 sansar main sabhi jatiyon main baansuri ityadi phunk ke vaadya, kuch taar yaa taant ke vaadya, kuch chamade se madhe hue vaadya, kuch thonkkar bajaane ke vaadya milte hai
 It seems that till the time of Bharata in India, the anthem was earlier only called 'geet'
 vaadya main jahaan geet nahin hota tha, keval daada, diddid jaise shushk akshar hote the, vahaan use 'nirgeet' yaa 'bahirgeet' kehete the or nritt athwa nrity kii ek alag kala thi
 But gradually the three songs, instruments and dances became intertwined with the "music" - songs, instruments and dances of the trio
 bharat se baahar anya deshon main keval geet or vaadya ko sangeet main ginate hai; nrity ko ek bhinn kala maanate hai
 In India also, dance is counted in music only because it is accompanied by an equal song or instrument or both
 upar likhaa ja chukaa he ki swar or lay kii kala ko sangeet kehete hai
 Vowel and rhythm are found in both song and instrument, but in dance there is only rhythm, not tone
 ham sangeet ke antargat keval geet or vaadya kii charchaa karenge, kyonki sangeet keval isi arth main anya deshon main bhi vyavahrut hota he
 The primary source of music is natural sounds
 prak sangeet-yug main manushya ke prakruti kii dhvaniyon or unki vishisht lay ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 Not all types of natural sounds can be the basis of music, so an attempt has been made to test the sounds that produce the emotion and to tie them to the rhythm
 prakruti kii ve dhvaniyaan jinhone manushya ke man-mastishk ko sparsh kar ullasit kiya, vahi sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath sangeet kaa saadhan baniin
 Though thinkers have different opinions
 darshanikon ne naad ke chaar bhaagon para, pashyanti, madhyamaa or vaikhari main se madhyamaa ko sangitopayogi swar kaa aadhaar mana
 Darwin said that animals sound sweet at the time of the rati
 manushya ne jab is prakaar kii dhwani kaa anukaran armbh kiya to sangeet kaa udbhav hua
 Karl Stumpf considered the singularity of sound by humans after the genesis of language to be the origin of vowels
 unnisvin shatee ke uttararddh main bharatendu harishchandr ne kaha ki ‘‘sangeet kii utpatti maanviya samvednaa ke saath hui
 He described music as a set of songs, playing, telling and dancing
 praachya shastron main sangeet kii utpatti ko lekar anek rochak kathaayen hai
 Devraj used to be a singer, player and dancer in Indra's meeting
 gandharv gaate the, apsaraayen nrity karti thim or kinnar vaadya bajaate the
 The song has been predominant in gandharva-kala
 aadi main gaan tha, vaadya kaa nirmaan peeche hua
 The song was a staple
 yahi kaaran he ki chaahe geet ho, chaahe vaadya sabakaa naam sangeet pad gaya
 Dance from behind also took its form
 sansar kii jitani arya bhashaayen hai unamem sangeet shabd achche prakaar se gane ke arth main miltaa he
 The word 'music' is made of metal
 anya bhashaaon main ‘san’ kaa ‘sin’ ho gaya he or ‘gai’ yaa ‘ga’ dhaatu kisi na kisi rup main isi arth main anya bhashaaon main bhi vartmaan he
 In anglo-saxon it is translated 'singan' which has become 'sing' in modern English, in Icelandic it is 'sig', in Danish it is 'sing', in Dutch it is 'sing', in Dutch it is 'tsingen', in German it is 'singen' 
 arabi main ‘gana’ shabd he jo ‘gaan’ se purnatah miltaa he
 In the first 'sangitaratnakar' text, the combination of singing, playing and dancing is called 'sangeet'
 vastutah ‘geet’ shabd main ‘sam’ jodakar ‘sangeet’ shabd bana, jiskaa arth he ‘gaan sahit’
 The anthem performed with dance and playing is 'sangeet'
 shastron main sangeet ko sadhana bhi mana gaya he
 Authentically, the remains of most ancient civilizations, statues, postures and frescoes reveal that people were familiar with music thousands of years ago
 dev-devi ko sangeet kaa aadi prerak sirf hamaare hi desh main nahin mana jaataa, europe main bhi yah vishwaas rahaa he
 The mystery is revealed by paying attention to the words for music in Europe, Arabia and Persia
 sangeet ke liye unani bhashaa main shabd ‘mausiki’, latin main ‘musika’, francisi main ‘musik’, portugi main ‘musika’, german main moosik’, angreji main ‘mujeec’, ibrani, arabi or farsi main ‘mosiki’
 All these words are equitable
 ye sabhi shabd unani bhashaa ke ‘mus’ shabd se bane hai
 'muse' is considered the goddess of poetry and music in the Greek tradition
 kosh main ‘mus’ shabd kaa arth diya he ‘di insapiring godes of saang’ arthath ‘gaan kii prerica devi’
 In the Greek tradition, 'muse' is considered the daughter of "jyaus"
 jyos’ shabd sanskrit ke ‘dyus’ kaa hi roopaantar he jiskaa arth he ‘swarg’
 The conception of 'jyaus' and 'muse' is very similar to Brahma and Saraswati
 bhartiya sangeet kaa janm veda ke uccharan main dekha ja saktaa he
 The oldest book of music is the Natyashastra of Bharata Muni
 anya granth hai: brihaddeshi, dattilam, sangitaratnakar
 Music is very important for us

 lekin unka swasthya thik na rahane se kuch hi maah baad ve naukari chhodkar waapas aa gayi
 Six of his family's eight siblings had interracial marriages
 un dinon yah asaadhaaran baat thi
 It was an indicator of progress
 savita ji ne kahaan hai ki "ham bhai-bahanon ke antarjaateey vivaah karne par hamaare parivaar ne koi virodh nahin kiya
 The reason for this was that the whole family was well-educated and progressive
 " a Mesurian Sadhgrih named Dr SM Rao lived in Vile Parle, Bombay, who was closely associated with Ambedkar
 jab ambedkar dilli se bombay aate tab vah aksar unke yahan aa jate the
 Around 1947, Sharda Kabir also used to visit Dr

 unki tabiyat kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye koi vyakti hona chahie
 In a letter written to Dadasaheb Gaikwad on 16 March 1948, Ambedkar said, "people will have doubts when they hire a nurse or a woman to take care of the house

 Many people from both Brahmin and Dalit communities were enraged by their marriage
 anek brahmanon ne ambedkar kii dalit raajnneeti or vichaardhaara par sawaal khadey kiye
 a section of Dalits said that nothing wrong could have happened with this
 kya babasahab ko shaadi ke liye ek brahman stri hi mili thi
 Many called it a conspiracy of Brahmins
 kuch ne khilli bhi udayi
 But many of Ambedkar's followers believed that what he does, he thinks, is more thoughtful and sensible, so he must have done it right
 vivaah ke baad doctor sharada kabir ko doctor savita ambedkar kaha jane laga
 He started serving Bhimrao Ambedkar

 By party tradition, Zuma was already in line to succeed Mbeki as vice-president of the ANC
 party gathan ne, oktober or navambar 2007 main namakan sammelan yojit kiya, jisamen zuma kaa naam ANC adhyaksh ke liye sabase pasandida rahaa or nihitarth swaroop ve 2009 ke dakshin africa ke raashtrapati ke liye bhi chahete the
 On 18 December 2007, Zuma defeated ANC President and South African President Thabo Mbeki in his second term with 2329 votes against 1505 votes
 On 28 December 2007, Scorpion prosecuted Zuma in the High Court on charges of fraud, money laundering, corruption and fraud
 sitambar 2008 main, ANC ne desh ke raashtrapati pad se thabo mabek ko waapas "bula liya" or yah ghoshnaa kii ki party ke upaadhyaksh, kgalema motlanthe 2009 ke aam chunaavon tak kaaryvahak raashtrapati bane rahenge or uske baad zuma nae raashtrapati honge
 He won the election on 6 May and on 9 May 2009 he was sworn in as the President of South Africa
 zuma ek aarthik "lokadhikaaravaadi" hai jo khud ko kabhi-kabhi "samaajawaadee" ke rup main varnit karte hai
 He is supported by the trade union and the South African Communist Party
 unhone africa rashtriya congress ke mahila or yuva lig kaa bhi samarthan praapt kiya
 According to The Guardian and The New York Times, he has spoken of redistribution of wealth and is associated with socialists and communists who are willing to redistribute wealth
 lekin di gargian ne yah bhi khabar di he ki zuma ne "videshi niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha karne kaa aashwaasan" diya he
 Zuma also got involved in a corruption-related controversy after his financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was accused of corruption and fraud
 us samay lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshak rahe bulilani ngakuka zuma or ANC mukhya sachetak tony yengeni ke khilaaf takat kaa durupyog karne ke iljaamon kii jaanch kar rahe the
 In 2004, Zuma became a prominent figure in the Schabir Shaik trial
 schabir shaike ek durban vyapaaree or zuma ke vittiya salaahkaar the, dakshin africa nausena ke durban main ek prastaavit waterfrant vikaas ke liye vailar varg ladaai ke jahaajon kii kharid main rishwatakhori or nakandla main zuma ke bhavy nivas par kiye gaye kharch ke sandarbh main unase sawaal kiya gaya
 During the trial, Shack was shown requesting a bribe of 500 000 rand per year for Zuma in support of Zuma's defense contractor Thomson CSF, which is recorded in the infamous "encrypted fax"
 2 june 2005 ko, shaike ko doshi paaya gaya or 15 saal kii sajaa sunai gai
 Judge Hillary Squires gives a detailed account of several transactions between Shack and Zuma, with a summary that "all the accused companies have been used to pay Jacob Zuma at one time"
 The media incorrectly quoted Squires' statement with the phrase "a generally corrupt relationship", while the exact same word does not exist in court transcripts
 is vaakyansh kii shuruyaat karne waalon kii pratiraksha main, shaike ke khilaaf faisle ke sampoorn pratilekh main vastav main zuma kaa zikr 471 baar hua he, "bhrasht" yaa "bhrashtachar" shabd kaa prayog 54 baar kiya gaya he or isamen aise 12 vaakya hai jinamein "bhrasht" or "zuma" donon shabdon kaa prayog ek saath he
 Later media sources changed the phrase to "mutually beneficial symbiosis", which was replaced by Article 235 of the verdict, which was: "to think it would be against common sense and ordinary human nature to benefit from the accusations of Zuma
" Was not realized, which was getting far more than before 1997; and even if nothing was ever said between them that could help mutually beneficial symbiosis Is installed, which can generate a sense of in only thanks to a series of continuing in accordance with the evidence was there, its conditions to start and these payments after the recipient
 " On June 14, 2005, President Thabo Mbeki removed Zuma from the post of vice-president, after media speculated about his future with deep speculation
 mabek ne sansad kii sanyukt baithak main kaha ki "yah mananeey up raashtrapati, sarkaar, hamaari yuva loktantric pranali or hamaare desh ke hit main sabase acha hoga ki mananeey jacob zuma ko unke prajatantr ke up raashtrapati or cabinet ke sadsy ke pad kii jimmedaariyon se mukt kar diya jaae
" tab zuma ne sansad ke sadsy ke pad se istipha de diya
 Following the Shack trial, Zuma was formally accused of corruption by the National Prosecuting Authority
 sthagan ke liye abhiyojan paksh dwaara daayar aavedan ke khaarij ho jane ke baad maamle ko petermarittsburg hai court se waapas le liye gaya
 Zuma's legal team continued to delay the action and despite Zuma's assertion that he wished to look into the matter in court, he managed to conceal some important evidence from the court that resulted in the prosecution's adjournment on the due date Had to file an application for 8 navambar 2007 ko supreme court of apil ne rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke paksh main apana nirnay sunaaya jo zuma ke raksha dal dwaara kiye hue vibhinn khoj or jabti sambandhi kaaryon ke sambandh main tha or unke dwaara kiye gaye chaar apilon ko kaarij kar diya gaya
 The decision was in relation to obtaining a personal diary of a senior member of a French arms company by the National Prosecuting Authority, which provided information related to Zuma's corrupt practices, possibly while awarding an arms deal
 28 disambar 2007 ko, scorpian ne zuma par ucch nyaayalay main thag-vyapaar, kaale dhan ko vaid karne, bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi ke vibhinn maamalon main abhiyog chalaaya
 a conviction and imprisonment of more than 1 year would have made Zuma ineligible for election to the South African Parliament and consequently he would have been disqualified for the presidency of South Africa
 4 agast 2008 ko zuma adaalat main haazir hue
 12 sitambar 2008 ko petermarittsburg nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke bataaya ki zuma par lage bhrashtachar ke aarope prakriyaatmak aadhaar par avaidh hai kyonki lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshaalay ne aarope lagane kaa nirnay lene se pehle zuma ko abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka nahi diya or rajya ko kanoonee bhugtan karne ke nirdesh die
 Nikholson also stated that, he believed that political interference played a role in the decision to file charges again against Zuma, although he did not explain why he dismissed the allegations against Zuma as invalid
 nikholson ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki unka nirnay zuma ke aparaadh yaa nirparaadh se sambandhit nahin tha, balki yah keval ek prakriyaatmak aadhaar par tha
 Various media reports have misinformed that the charges against Zuma have been dismissed
 maamla yah nahin tha
 The NDPP was able to re-accuse Zuma, however, only once he was given the opportunity to present a representation to the NDPP, based on the ndpp's decision to do so
 In paragraph 47 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson wrote, abhyavedan ko sunne kii baadhyataa audi alterum partem ke siddhant kaa ek hissaa he
 The requirement is that a person who may be adversely affected by a decision may be given an opportunity to make a representation with a view to achieving a favorable outcome
 The affected person should usually be informed of the essence or elements of the case to which he or she has to respond
 adaalat ne yah nirdhaarit kiya ki NDPP ke samvidhan kii dhara 179 main ullikhit prakriya kaa paalan kar paane kii vifaltaa ne NDPP dwaara zuma par punah aarope lagane ke nirnay ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 Judge Nicholson found that various estimates could be made at the time of the charges leveled against Zuma, which corroborated the conclusion that it contained some degree of political interference by the executive branch of the government
 nyaayadhish nikholson apane nirnay ke para 210 main likhte hai, After the President's political defeat in Polokwane, the timing of the indictment by Mr Emsche on 28 December 2007 was most unfortunate

 In Article 220 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson further wrote, raajnneetik hastkshep, dabaav yaa prabhaav ke sanketon se upar uth kar jo vyavhaar maine nirdhaarit kiye hai unamem ek chintajanak dhaancha he
 It began with the "political leadership" given by Minister Maduna to Mr
 Ngcuka when he refused to prosecute the applicant, whose crime was to talk to and meet with Thint representatives and other matters that i have referred to
 Given the rule of evidence, the court is bound to accept the conclusion that is least suited to the interest of the party who has special knowledge of the facts
 yah nishchit rup se yengeni maamle main ullikhit "suraag yaa suzav" ke raajnneetik hastkshep se adhik prabal he
 It is a matter of grave concern that such a process took place in New South Africa and prompted destruction under apartheid regime
 " The South African judiciary was severely criticized by Zuma's supporters before the hearing
 , jinamein paul nagobeni jaisi kuch pramukh kanoonee hastiyaan bhi shaamil thim, is sandarbh main, vidmbana yah thi ki dakshin africa nyaayapalika ko teesri baar zuma ke paksh main paaya gaya, jisame un par par lagaae gaye balaatkaar ke aarope se bari hona bhi shaamil tha
 The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal against this decision
 thabo mabek ne petermarittsburg ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke nirnay par apil karne ke liye sanvaidhanik nyaayalay main ek halafanama daayar kiya: It was unfair for the court to come to such far-reaching "vexatious, scandalous and unfavorable" conclusions related to me, and to judge and condemn those conclusions based on the Zuma case

 These adverse findings led to the withdrawal of my name by my ANC party - a request that i have accepted as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years

 a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, Talali Talali, told Pretoria by phone on 23 September, “we have received the papers
 yah vichaaradhin he
 " 12 janvari 2009 ko blomphontain ke supreme court of apil main is apil ke liye nirnay ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to decide on two aspects of the appeal
 The first aspect was whether Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before he decided to withdraw the bribery and corruption charges against him
 The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in understanding the political interference given by then President Thabo Mbeki in the context of the npa's decision to impose charges on Zuma
 NPA ke faisle kii samiksha ke dauraan abhyavedan aamantrit karne ke sawaal par harms deepi ne paaya ki nikholson dwaara di gai samvidhan ke 179 khand kii vyakhya galat thi kyonki NPA kaa aisa koi daayitv nahin tha or isliye ve zuma par aarope lagane ke liye swatantra tha joki usne kiya
 On the question of Nikholson's argument given by Mbeki about political interference, Harms DP found that "the lower court has violated its rights"

 The revelations were in the form of pieces of phone talk showing that Scorpion's president, Leonard mccarthy, and former National Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulleani Ngcuka, had conspired with Zuma about the timing of the prosecution, presumably Zuma's political The opponent was for the political benefit of President Thabo Mbeki

 Soon after the announcement of the NPA, however, at least two political parties reported that they would consider legal action on their own if the charges were dropped

 While Zuma filed his response tentatively, Ampshe delayed the hearing of the case, requesting two extensions to present the npa's response
 NPA ke pravaktaa mthunzi mahaaga ne kaha ki ve kagajaat daakhil nahin karenge kyonki "bakaayaa maamle" aise hai jinhen hal kiya janaa baaki he
 District, the Democratic Alliance party chief, argued that Zuma's response was fundamentally wrong and "they have no constitutional basis"
 While legal challenges continued, a June 2009 poll showed that more than half of South Africans believe that President Jacob Zuma is doing a good job
 june 2009 ke ant main TNS research studies dwaara kiye gaye chunaav main yah zaahir ho gaya ki zuma ke anumodan str main lagaataar sudhaar hua he

 Despite the defection of some former supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to protest outside the court, relentlessly rebuking the integrity and morality of the prosecutor, abusing a close friend of the accuser and throwing stones at another woman as the prosecutor The acts sparked criticism from anti-rape groups
 zuma ke pratirakshak dal ne peedit mahila ke yon ateet se sambandhit saboot pesh kiye or jor dekar kaha ki yah shaareerik sambandh donon kii sahamati se hua
 The prosecution insisted that the woman's lack of resistance was due to her being in a state of shock and that the relationship between the two was similar to the father-daughter relationship

 An independent analyst suggested, "according to recent surveys, seeing Zuma and his machine gun convoy heading towards the union building is primarily discouraging to the middle class and businessmen

 However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a leftist candidate as many of his supporters understand and pointed out that the global and national economic barriers that prevailed during Mbeki's rule were also in the next presidential term

 Zuma also deserves condemnation from religious and secular groups when he declares that the ANC will rule South Africa until Jesus returns and it is God's will to continue the anc's rule: ishwar chahta he ki ham is desh par shashan karen kyonki ham ek maatr aisa sanghathan hai jiske banane ke samay padariyon dwaara aashirwad diya gaya tha

 media ne atakalein lagaai ki is ghatana main zuma kaa haath ho saktaa he, lekin ANC ke raashtrapati ke pravaktaa ne dridhtaa se iskaa khandan kiya
 Just a few days before that, however, he had publicly stated that as President of South Africa, he would personally ensure Shaik's release
 6 agast 2009 main, zuma ne sandile nagakobo ko dakshin africa ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke rup main manonith kiya, iske kasrn unhen chaar vipakshi samoohon ke aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 1 oktober 2009 ko, unke niyukti kii pushti kii gai
 The Democratic Alliance, Congress of the People, Incatha Freedom Party, and Independent Democrats accused Zuma of failing to properly discuss these parties before he nominated Ngcobo
 vipaksh ne zuma se is prakriya ko shuru se punah aarambh karne kaa aagrah kiya or kaha ki ve vartmaan up mukhya-nyaayadhish dickgang moseneke ko us pad par dekhnaa chahenge
 As President of South Africa, it was mandatory for Zuma to declare his financial interests within 60 days of assuming office
 lekin, march 2010 tak, nau maheenon apana kaarybhaar sambhaalane ke baad bhi, ve aisa karne main asafal rahe
 This led to increased pressure from opposition parties and ANC alliance partner COSATU to do so
 
 ANC pravaktaa bryan sokutu ne kaha ki zuma kaa "maamla vishesh" he kyonki unke "bade parivaar" ke kaaran unhen sampatti ghoshit karne main mushkil pesh aa rahi hai
 The ANC later distanced itself from this statement
 Zuma revealed his interests shortly thereafter
 2010 main, zuma ke angrakshakon ko kai janata or patrakaron se jude maamalon main shaamil ghatnaon main ulajhaa paaya gaya
 In February, Chumani Maxwell, a student from Cape Town, was detained by police for "indecent gesturing" towards Zuma's convoy
 maxwele, jo ek sakriy ANC sadsy hai, police ko ek likhit kshamaa yachana die jane ke 24 ghante ke baad reeha kiye gaye, jo unke anusaar majaburi main likhaa gaya tha
 He has also claimed that his house was raided by the police without uniform and he was forced to sit in the vehicle at gunpoint
 maxwele ne baad main police ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii or unki or se maanav adhikaar ayog main ek shikaayat darj kiya gaya
 When the incident was discussed in Parliament, it took the form of a controversy
 
 In March, journalist Tshepo Lesole was forced by police to destroy pictures of Zuma's convoy pulled from his camera and two photographers were detained by police at the same time as they were taking pictures of Zuma's Johannesburg home Were 
 Sky News reporter Emma Hurd claimed that in 2009, she was pushed, manhandled and "tortured" by Zuma bodyguards

 Stalinism is not the name of any ideology or any philosophical concept
 mote taur par samyavaadee samaaj ke nirmaan ke liye joseph stallin dwaara soviet sangh main apanaayi gayi nitiyon kaa samucchy hi stallinavaad kehalaata he
 It gradually developed into a political phenomenon in the three decades following the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the death of its leader Lenin
 chunki 1927 se lekar 1956 ke bich soviet communist party ke pramukh rahe joseph stallin ke jivan main hi kuch buddhijiviyon ne marxvad-leninavaad-stallinavaad naamak nayi vichaardhaara kaa sutrikaran karne kaa kamjor sa prayaas kiya tha
 An example of this is found in an article by Karl Radek published in Pravda, December 1934
 par is ravaiye ko na to stallin ne protsaahit kiya or na hi soviet communist party ke anya siddhantkaron ne
 Nevertheless, it got the name of Stalinism due to Stalin's intellectual and political personality present at the center of this phenomenon
 ise do tareeke se samajha ja saktaa he : soviet sangh main stallin ke netritv main tees saal tak chali samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii pariyojna ke taur par or is daur se nikali vaicharik or santhnik pravritiyon ke rup main jinhone sari duniya main marxvaadi raajnneeti ko kisi na kisi rup main prabhavit kiya
 Within the Marxist movement, there is a strong controversy about Stalin's role in Soviet history and evaluating Stalin's influence on marxism-leninism
 is lihaaz se sari duniya ke marxvaadi teen hisson main bante hue hai : ek hissaa vah he jo stallinavaad ko puri tarah se sweekaarte hue use marxvad kaa pramukh vyaavhaarik rup qaraar detaa he, doosraa hissaa use puri tarah se kaarij karte hue marxvaadi prayog kii tyajya vikruti qaraar detaa he or teesraa hissaa vah he jo stallinavaad ke prabhaav ko aam taur par prerak or sakaaratmak maanane ke baavjood uske kuch pahaluon kii aalochana karata he 
 In the non-marxist parts of the Left and other ideological circles, Stalinism is seen as a totalitarian trend that established a highly violent and oppressive state
 party kaaryakrttaaon ke bich stallin ke naam pukaare jane vaale joseph vissiarowich jugashvili kaa janm jiorgia main 21 disambar 1879 ko ek garib mochi ke ghar main hua tha
 He was educated in a religious seminary in Tbilisi, where he often faced punishment due to his revolutionary tendencies
 1899 main ve peshewar krantikari ho kar marxvaadi andolan main sakriy bhagidaari karne lage
 a skilled organizer and a mastery of underground political work, Stalin gained prominence in revolutionary circles
 1904 se hi unhone khud ko lenin or bolshevikon ke saath jod liya or 1912 main bolshevik kendriya samiti ke sadsy bane
 Between 1902 and 1917, Stalin was arrested countless times, given lengthy sentences and expelled several times
 1913 main unhen pakad kar siberia ke sudur uttari ilaake main bhej diya gaya jahaan se unki rihaai 1917 kii farvari kranti ke baad hi ho paayi
 Stalin held several key positions in the party immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution and during the Civil War
 paulitte beuro ke sabase shuruaati sadasyon main se ek stallin ko 1922 main party kaa mahasachiv niyukt kiya gaya
 He was the only leader of the party emerging from the lowest strata of the society to the highest positions
 janvari, 1924 main lenin kii mrityu ke baad unhone ek-ek karke apni nitiyon kaa virodh karne vaale trotski, zinoviv or buchaarin ko parajeet kiya or 1929 ke ant tak soviet party or rajya ke sarvocch netaa ke rup main ubhare
 Stalin died on March 5, 1953
 stallin ke aalochak aksar unhen keval jod-tod main maahir or maamuli bauddhik kshamtaaon vaale netaa ke rup main pesh karte hai
 But his work Anarchism or Socialism, which criticized Prince Kropatkin's ideas in 1906 itself? Was published
 unke saidhantik lekhan kii visheshta thi behad saral abhivyakti jiske kaaran vah kaaryakrttaaon ke bich kaafii pasand kiya jaataa tha
 Stalin is primarily known for the principle of establishing socialism in a country without a world revolution
 1924 ke baad se stallin ne apane is tark ko majboot karne vaala lekhan or vishleshan kiya
 It is often simplified to view Stalinism as a man of Stalin, but it is important to understand the structural reasons behind this political phenomenon
 bolshevik kranti ke parinamswaroop sthapit hui communist satta do virodhabhasi ayaamon se mil kar bani thi
 On the one hand, there were aspects of direct participation of the general public in the form of Soviets in which direct democracy was reflected
 loktantr kaa yah rup pashchimi deshon main viksit ho rahe bazaar aadhaarit udaarataavaadi loktantr se behatar or radical lagata tha
 On the other hand, a new emerging system was being guided and controlled by a disciplined worker based Communist Party
 is party kii bagdor lenin ke haath main thi jo sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee, loktantric cendravaad or krantikari haraval daste ke aadhaar par bani party kii bhoomika main yakeen rakhte the
 In his work Left Communism: a Childish Merge, published in 1920, he made it clear what the order of sequence of Soviet power would be
 sabase upar netaa, phir party, phir mazdoor varg or phir janata
 The responsibility of Stalinism, which flourished in the backdrop of the supremacy of the leader and the party, can be attributed to some ideological trends as well as to the extraordinary coincidence of the peoples of our country
 1918-21 ke bich chale grih yuddh, uske baad ke do varshon or phir 1924-27 ke bich kii avadhi ko itihaaskaaron ne ‘sarvasattavadi loktantr’ kaa virodhabhasi naam diya he
 It is believed that the seed of Stalinism fell on this stage
 baad ke saalon main pashchimi takaton dwaara pehle samaajawaadee rajya kii ‘poonjeewaadi or samrajyavaadee gherebandi’ kaa muqabla karne ke naam par kai tarah ke sansthagat or vaicharik taur-tareeke ijad kiye gayi
 Except for a few of these, Stalin was not responsible for himself
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad party ke sheersh netritv main shaamil unke tatkaaleen saathi or satta ke liye unase hode karne vaale netaa bhi un adhinayakawadi or damankaaree pravritiyon kii shuruyaat main bhagidaar the jinke aadhaar par aane vaale samay ke liye soviet rajya kii vyaavhaarik neenv rakhi ja rahi thi
 Russian scholar Mikhail Ilyin has divided the development of the phenomenon of Stalinism into several stages
 soviet party ke bheetar kai saal tak chale gahan satta- sangharsh kaa ant disambar, 1927 main hui party congress ke rup main hua
 He has labeled this period as nascent Stalinism
 bachakaana vampanth ke marz kii aalochana karte hue lenin ne trotski dwaara pravartit satat kranti kii thisis se asahmati vyakt kii thi
 Five years before this, Lenin had shown the opposite of the established Marxist view in one of his articles that due to uneven economic-political development, efforts would have to be made to establish socialism in some countries or in the same country
 1921 main hui dasvin congress se hi party main ‘parjing’ arthath virodh kii awaz uthaane waalon kaa nishkasana karke party kii safaai kaa chalan shuru ho gaya tha
 Stalin, who attained a central position as party general secretary in 1922, added the idea of establishing socialism in a country in the second edition of his work The Foundations of Leninism in 1924 only by understanding this analysis of Lenin
 stallin ke samakaleen soviet siddhantkaar nikolai buchaarin ne bhi is vichaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki agar duniya ke pehle samaajawaadee rajya ko faujee suraksha kii guarantee di ja sake to ek desh main samaajwaad kii rachana kii ja sakati he
 Stalin liberated the party from opponents of his policies until the Fifteenth Congress, using the purging repeatedly
 party ke prayek pad par niyukti unke haath main aa gayi or unhone kshetreey party cametiyon main vishesh vibhaag sthapit kiye taaki har tarah kii niyuktiyon kii kadi nigaraanee kii ja sake
 Thus by 1927, the way of establishing totalitarian rule as a party-state in the Soviet Union was completely cleared
 duusare daur ko udiyaman stallinavaad kaa naam diya gaya he jo 1930 tak chalaa
 This was the time of industrialization, the collectivization of agriculture and the beginning of the Five Year Plans
 arthvyavastha puri tarah se rajya ke niojit niyantran main chali gayi
 Any separate identity on the surface of society was considered anti-soviet
 samaroopikaran kaa bolbalaa ho gaya
 These moves led to opposition within the party, which led Stalin to campaign vigorously from 1929 to 30 in the party
 kareeb ek lakh communist nikaal diye gayi
 Some ten percent of the old members were removed and new industrial workers were made members of the party
 1930-34 kii avadhi ko shuruaati stallinavaad qaraar dete hue ilyin ne bataaya he ki is daur main stallin ne varg sangharsh ko or tikhaa karne kii ghoshnaa karte hue yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki samaajwaad ko poonjeewaadi sazishon se bachaane ke liye raajnneetik virodhiyon ke kilaaf chal rahaa damanchakra kis tarah zaruri he
 In 1933, the phase of purging once again took place and 18 percent of the party members were removed
 lekin is baar unki jagah naye sadasyon kii bhartee nahin kii gayi
 The period 1934–41 was of complete Stalinism
 is daur main stallin kii vyakti-puja ko badhaava diya gaya
 This period of Stalinism is also known for the prosecutions of some of the important leaders of the Bolshevik revolution
 in mukademon main buchaarin or kamenev jaise netaaon ko apane aparaadh sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor karke maut kii sazaa di gayi
 In the same period the phenomenon of Nomenkletura emerged
 yah ek latin shabd tha jiskaa matlab tha naamon kii suchi
 Nomenkletura included workers and leaders for various committees through a process of advance nominations
 is suchi main naam aane kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti party- pranali dwaara niyantrit rahegaa, party jab chaahegi use hataa degi, padonnati karegi yaa use haashiye par phenk diya jayega
 Milovan Districts criticized Stalinism and called Nomenkletura a new class
 lekin soviet sangh main shashan chalaane waalon kaa yah tabaka mukhyatah party or prashasnic mashinari ke bich pul kaa kaam karata tha
 It was a major part of the government's system of control and mobilization
 isane rajya kii sanstha ko ek prashasnic bandobast main simit karke rakh diya
 After 1936, a 'struggle against the traitors of the public' started in place of party-purging
 yah ‘sangharsh’ nikolai yezove ke netritv main karyrat aantarik maamalon ke mantralay kii dekharekh main chalane vaali sikret police ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 By 1938, Yezhov, under the direct orders of Stalin, fiercely oppressed the state
 dwitiya vishwa-yuddh main soviet party-rajya pranali kii faujee jeet ne stallin kii vyakti-puja ko jabardast oochaal diya
 As a result of the world war, the Soviet Union got the status of the second superpower of the world along with America
 1945-52 ke bich kaa daur viksit stallinavaad mana jaataa he jisamen stallin ke netritv main duniya ke paimaane par ek samaajawaadee khemaa ubhara
 In this era, Marxism was declared a science and all types of sciences were included in it
 prakritik vigyaanon se nikali daleelon ke zariye dwandvatmak bhautikwaad or aitihaasik bhautikwaad ko pusht kiya jane laga
 Stalin himself led campaigns about many types of science
 isi dauraan bhashaa-vigyaan par khud unki pustika prakashit hui
 Communist International ie Comintern played a significant role in making Stalinism the dominant trend of world communist movement outside the Soviet Union

 Purusharth in Hinduism refers to the goal or purpose of a human being
 purusharth = purush+arth = arthath maanav ko 'kya' praapt karne kaa praytn karnaa chaiye
 The name of four Purusharthas have been taken from the Vedas for man - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha
 isliye inhen 'purusharthchatushtay' bhi kehete hai
 Maharishi Manu is the exponent of Purushartha Chatushtaya
 charvak darshan keval do hi purusharth ko manyata detaa he- arth or kaam
 He does not believe in religion and salvation
 maharishi vatsyayan bhi manu ke purusharth-chatushtay ke samarthak hai kintu ve moksh tathaa paralok kii apeksha dharm, arth, kaam par aadhaarit sansaarik jivan ko sarvopari maanate hai
 According to the Yogavishtha, according to the teachings of Sadjanas and Shastra, the variance of the mind is called Purushartha
 |bhartiya samskruti main in chaaron purushortho kaa vishisht sthaan rahaa he
 In fact, these men have established a wonderful fusion of materiality with spirituality in Indian culture
 pracheen kaal main hi bhartiya manishiyon ne dharm ko vaigyanik dhang se samajhane kaa praytn kiya tha
 While discussing the religion, it has been explained that religion is that which leads to the attainment of austerity and disinterestedness
 'abhyuday' se loukik unnati kaa tathaa 'nickshreyas' se parloukik unnati evam kalyaan kaa bodh hota he
 That is, religion was linked to both the physical and other aspects of life
 dharm kii isse adhik udaar paribhaasha or kya ho sakati he? dharm shabd kaa arth atyant gahan or vishaal he
 Under this, the means and rules of the highest development of human life are included
 dharm koi upasna padghati na hokar ek viraat or vilakshan jivan-padghati he
 This is not a show but a philosophy
 yah pradarshan nahin, prayog he
 This is the treatment of freeing man from illness, disease, title and leading to a meaningful life
 yah swayan dwaara swayan kii khoj he
 Opens the window to religion, knowledge and conduct
 dharm, aadmi ko pashutaa se maanavtaa kii ore prerit karata he
 Religion according to discipline is religion
 hriday kii pavitrataa hi dharm kaa vaastavik swaroop he
 The essence of religion is to have restraint in life
 dharm ke baad doosraa sthaan arth kaa he
 Without meaning, without wealth the work of the world cannot go on
 jivan kii pragati kaa aadhaar hi dhan he
 Money is required for all activities like business, trade, agriculture, etc
 yahi nahin, dharmik kaaryo, prachaar, anushthan aadi sabhi dhan ke bal par hi chalate hai
 Earning is the sacred duty of man
 isi se vah prakruti kii vipul sampada kaa apane or saare samaaj ke liye prayog bhi kar saktaa he or use sanwarddhit va sampusht bhi
 But for this, a solid foundation of righteousness is required
 dharm se vimukh hokar arthoparjan main sanlagn manushya ek ore to prakritik smapda kaa vivekahin dohan karke sansar ke paryaavaran santulat ko nasht karata he or duusari ore apane kshanik laabh se digbhramit hokar apane va samaaj ke liye anekanek rogon va kashton ko janm detaa he
 Religion has suggested to us that we should always strive to return more than we have taken from nature and society
 shastron ne arth ko maanav kii sukh-suvidhaon kaa mul mana he
 Religion also has its root meaning
 sukh praapt karne ke liye sabhi arth kii kaamana karte hai
 Therefore, Acharya Kautilya considers the meaning in the trinity as the root of religion and work
 bhoomi, dhan, pashu, mitra, vidya, kala va krishi sabhi arth kii shrenee main aate hai
 It is not possible to determine their number because it depends on the requirements of human life
 manushya swabhaavatah kaamana pradhan hota he, yah kahana bhi galat nahin hoga vah kaamanamay hota he
 Meaning is the only means to fulfill all these desires
 acharya vatsyayan 'arth' ko paribhaashit karte hue vidya, sona, chaandi, dhan, dhaany gruhasthi kaa saamaan, mitra kaa arjan evam jo kuch praapt hua he yaa arjeet hua he uskaa vardhan sab arth he
 According to Maharishi Vatsyayan, abhimaanik sukh ke saath anubaddh falvrat arth pritati kaam kehalaata he
 Further, while presenting the comparative superiority of the meaning, religion and work, it has been said that the Trigarga community is superior to the former
 kaam se shreshth arth he tathaa arth se shreshth dharm he
 But it varies from person to person
 madhwacharya ke anusaar vishaybhed ke anusaar kaam do prakaar kaa hota he
 The first of these is called normal work
 jab aatma kii shabdic vishyon ke bhogane kii ichha hoti he to us samay aatma kaa praytn gun utpann hota he
 That is, the soul is first united with the mind and the mind is connected with the subjects
 strot, tvach, chakshu, jiva tathaa dhran indriya kii kramshah sparsh, rup, ras, gandh main pravrutt hote hai
 In this nature of work, the justice-specific view is more visible
 iske anusaar shabdaadi vishayni buddhi hi vishyon ke bhoga ke swabhaav vaali buddhi hi vishyon ke bhoga vaali swabhaav vaali hone ke kaaran upachaar se kam kahi jaati he
 That is, the soul experiences happiness through the intellect through the subjects
 jo sukh he, saamaanya rup se vahi kaam he
