 The album was presented as a soundtrack for a film that was never produced, making it difficult to follow the plot
 apni ricard company ke purv darshan ke baad elbum ke bare main nakaaratmak feedback praapt karne ke pashchaat, maamle ko badtar banane ke liye, kis ne sambhavaneey ekal "da oth" or "a world vidout heroj" par bal dene ke liye kai deshon main ricard ke trek anukram badal die, jiske kaaran keval shrotaaon kii pehle se avyavasthit kathanak samajhane kii aakshamata nishchit hui
 Once released, fans' response to The Elder was harsh; He was unable to secure the gold position and was ranked No
 75 on the Billboard Albums Chart
 band ne nae elbum ke samarthan main keval do hi upasthitiyaan di, donon janvari 1982 main
 ek pradarshnee abisi ke der ratri kaarykram fraides main kii gai jabaki duusari ek hont-hilaane vaali pradarshnee thi jo italy ke senaremo festival ke dauraan setllite ke madhyam se prasaarit kii gai
 Kiss also performed "I" and "A World Without Heroes" on Solid Gold
 es frehale, jo kis ke nae sangeet nirdesan se niraash ho chuke the, duusare pradarshan se anupasthit rahe
 Troubled by Faceley recording a suffix album from the band, he did not participate actively in the production of the album and gave lead vocals in only one track, "dark Light"
 unhone apane guitar bhaag wilton, connecticut main apane ghar ke studio main ricard kiye or dak se agrin ko bhej die
 Another reason for Frehley's trouble was that Peter Criss's departure and Carr's lack of equal partners would often leave the group 2–1
 june 1982 main, frehale ke band se prasthaan karne ke bare main samjhauta kiya gaya, haalanki unhone aadhikarik taur par disambar tak ise choda nahin or 1985 tak simons or frehale ke saath ek vyapaar bhagidaar bane rahe
 In his autobiography Kiss and make-up, Simmons stated that Eddie van Halen wanted to fill Frehley's position
 simons or edi ke bhai elex ne edi ko vine helen ke saath rahane ke liye raji kiya
 Soon after, Kiss brought major changes to his business practice - the main ones being the separation from his nine-year-old manager, Bill Aucoin, and editing his unmanageable management tree
 haalanki frehale ne pehle se hi band ko chhodane kaa phasela kar liya tha, phir bhi unhen 1982 ke kilorz or kricharaz of da nit ke cover par darshaya gaya, yadhyapi unhone kisi bhi elbum kii ricarding main hissaa nahin liya
 Creatures of the Night was Kiss's heaviest album to date, and although considered superior to Music From "the Elder", it ranked No
 45 on the charts and was not certified Gold until 1994
 frehale kii anupasthiti main, kis ne elbum ricard karne ke liye kai guitarvadakon kaa istemaal kiya, jinamein vini vincent bhi shaamil the
 Frehley last appeared with the band in the video for the single "I Love It Loud", written in partnership by Vincent
 frehale mul kricharaz of da nit elbum kalakriti par bhi dikhaai die
 
 However, the liner notes associated with the remix LP praised both S
 Frehley and Winnie Vincent for the lead guitar performances in the album Creatures of the Night
 ) When the band began their tenth anniversary tour in December 1982, Vincent officially replaced Frehley
 vincent mul rup se band main apana janm naam prayog karnaa chaahate the, magar jin simons ne ise is aadhaar par manaa kar diya ki yah sunne main "kaaphi prajateey" lagata he: vishesh rup se simons ke anusaar "yah ek fal bechney vaale jaisaa lagata he"; simons ne yah tak kaha ki "uchit rup se yaa anuchit dhang se, rock or role chhavi ke bare main he"
 vincent ne phir "mik furi" naam kaa suzav diya magar yah bhi manaa kar diya gaya
 Simmons later suggested that the name be changed to Winnie Vincent
 vincent ne kis ke saath ek purna sadsy ke rup main judane ke liye sakriy rup se khub praytn karnaa shuru kar diya
 Despite the misgivings that Simmons and Stanley had about his personality, Vincent was taken into the band
 stanley ne ek charitra, "da variar" dizin kiya or vincent ke liye mechap ek misr vaasi aankh ke aas paas kendrit rahaa
 From 1982 to 1983, Kiss had a new lineup: Simmons, Stanley, Eric Carr and Vincent
 This incarnation of Kiss was the last incarnation of their original makeup era
 kricharaz of da nit daure ke ant main, band ne apana mechap hataa diya
 Vincent appeared on the cover of Lick It Up and gained a reputation as the lead guitarist
 vincent elbum "fits like a glove" ke das main se aath gaanon main sah-lekhak the or "dance aal over yor phase" simons ne akele likhaa tha
 It is rumored that Vincent used to record the entirety of the lead for the songs in the album, and Simmons was able to select the parts of the lead that he found to be superior to the lyrics, stifling Vincent's creative abilities
 spashtatya, simons ek zyaada madhur dhwani or anubhav chaahate the jo kis ke prashansakon ne frehale ke guitar ekal main hameshaa suna tha or jiske vah aadi the
 Additionally, Vincent's performance of the guitar solo was stopped during the live broadcast because both Stanley and Simmons felt Vincent's lead would be too long
 vincent kaa vyaktitv stanley or simons donon ke saath hi acchhee tarah se jamaa nahin or kricharaz daure ke ant main unhen kis se nikaal diya gaya
 He was hired again before recording began for Lick It Up because Simmons and Stanley couldn't find a new lead guitarist so soon
 ek baar phir vyaktitv mudde uthne lage or lik it ap daure ke baad vincent ko nikaal diya gaya or unke sthaan par mark saint jon ko rakh liya gaya
 Vincent's work in Creatures of the Night was not officially recognized until the album reemerged in 1997
 baad main kis ne vincent ko apane 1992 elbum revange main ek geetkaar ke rup main prayog kiya, jisamen unhone "anholi", "heart of krom" or "ai just vaana" jaise gaanon main yogadan diya
 This was long before, however, when Vincent, Simmons and Stanley feuded with each other for the third time, and their musical relationship broke up permanently
 vincent ke kis se nikaale jane ke asli kaaran ke bare main kis prashansakon ke bich saalon se nirantar afvaahen prachaarit huin hai, jisamen kam se kam ek band sadsy ne tippanee dene se manaa kiya or keval itnaa kaha ki kanoonee taur par yah charchaa kaa vishay nahin tha
 Simmons said in an interview several years later that the reason for Vincent's removal was his "unethical behavior" but did not elaborate on any of the details
 "maine vincent kusaano kaa naam "vini vincent" rakhaa
 yah ekmaatr uphaar he jisaki unhen anumati he
 It is interesting that Winnie did not change her name back to Winnie Cusano
 Winnie, for the record, was fired because of unethical behavior, not because of a lack of talent
 The boy is very talented
 vah aniatik tha
 He was fired
 " jin simons Realizing it was time for a change, Kiss decided to drop her trademark makeup and attire

 With St
 John's on board, Kiss released a compelling metal album, Animalize, on 13 September 1984
 animalise ne lik it ap kii safalataa kaa anusaran kiya or em tivi par aksar "hewanz on fire" kaa video bajaaye jane ke falswaroop, animalise us dashak ke dauraan america main band kaa sarvshereshth bikne vaala ricard rahaa

 St
 John, however, soon fell ill with reactive arthritis during the tour and performed only a handful of performances
 In December 1984, St
 John was expelled from Kiss and replaced by Bruce Kulick
 Kulik was Kiss's fourth lead guitarist in less than three years, but remained with the band for twelve years
 Apart from Simmons and Stanley with the longest tenure, Kulik was one of the longest-running members of the band, but he never wore a make-up replicating the band
 kulik ke pehle sangeet samarohon main se ek datroit, michigan ke cobo haul main hua tha
 It was filmed for the m TV special Animalize Live
 yah baad main band ke pehle home video ke rup main jari kiya gaya
 Stanley, Simmons, Carr and Kulick's lineup turned out to be the most enduring since the initial lineup, and for the rest of the 1980s Kiss released a series of platinum albums - 1985's Asylum, 1987's Crazy Nights, and 1988's smashies compilation of the greatest hits
 , Thrashies and hits
 Notably, Crazy Nights was one of Kiss's most successful foreign albums

 in gaiyr-mechap saalon ke dauraan, kis ne apni pahchaan or prashansak aadhaar ke saath sangharsh kiya
 Simmons, controversially a major force of Kiss during the 70s, remained less involved in the group in the 80s as he began to seek outside work, most notably, a film career
 After the band was exposed, he struggled with the destruction of the Demon personality
 is samay ke dauraan, stanley kis kii prabal shakti ban gaye, saath hi unke sabase pramukh sadsy bhi
 The band decided to recruit Bob Ezrin once again to produce their 1990 debut album

 Kiss appeared live at conferences, conducted question-and-answer sessions, autographed autographs and performed a 2-hour acoustic set, largely of spontaneous fan requests

 === Next Album === In March 2010, Paul Stanley announced that Kiss would begin work on his next album and was likely to be released in the next twelve to eighteen months, beginning or mid-2011
 == Musical style == Due to the ambiguity between "hard rock" and "heavy metal" and "heavy metal", Kiss's music always falls under the label of one or the other
 lekin band ke gathan ke sheeghra baad aalochakon ne unhen "thunderrokarz" bulaayaa
 alamusic dwaara unka sangeet is tarah varnit he: "enthemic, fist-pounding hard rock kaa vyavsaayik rup se prabal mishran, jo chikne hook or gaathagiton dwaara chaalit or teevr guitar, khushamadi dhunon or vyapak taron dwaara yantrachaalit he
 It was a sound that formed the basis for both vertical rock and pop mantles that dominated rock in the late '80s
 iske pehle samikshatmak nirikshan main kis ko "rolling stone" main "ek american blike sabbath" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 "the catchy mondo-disforto riff of the twin guitars and the boss playing and the drums backing up with affection", "stone" said of "hotter than Hell", "kiss evokes a deceptively controlled kind of gibberish hysteria
" Which is closely similar to the melody once used by the German Panzer Tank Division

 In 1991, after substantial layoffs in the company's computer division, Pixar signed a $ 26 million dollar deal with Disney to make three computer animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story

 Perhaps the lack of rights to the story and sequence was painful for Pixar and it caused controversy in the relationship
 2004 ke prarambh main dono companiyon ne ek nayaa qaraar karne kii koshish kii
 The new deal was for distribution only as Pixar wanted to control production and take ownership of the resulting assets of the film
 company apni filmon kaa swany hi vittaposhan karnaa or dijani ko vitaran shulk ke rup main keval 10 se 15 pratishat kaa bhugtan kar 100 pratishat munaafaa lenaa chaahati thi
 Most importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar sought control of the films under production including The Incredibles and Cars under the old agreement
 dijani ne in sharton ko asweekaarya mana lekin piksar sahamat nahin hua
 The differences between Steve Jobs and Disney's then president and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations even more difficult
 2004-ke madhya main ve puri tarah se alag ho gaye, jobs ne ghoshnaa kar di ki piksar dijani ke alaava bhagidaaron kii sakriy rup se khoj kar rahaa he
 Pixar did not negotiate with other distributors

 In preparation for a possible separation between Pixar and Disney, in late 2004, Jobs announced that Pixar would no longer release films in the Disney-scheduled November timeframe in the early summer months
 isse piksar apni pramukh release kii dividi christmas kii kharidari ke mausam ke dauraan jari kar paaegaa
 An additional benefit of the delay in the cars was that the remaining timeframe in the pixar-disney contract was extended to see how the situation between the two companies lived

 However, this distribution arrangement became invalid after Disney completed the acquisition of Pixar
 shaamil ho gaye
 As part of the deal, Pixar's co-founder, then-executive vice president John Lasseter, became principal creative advisor to both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and builds the company's theme parks
 lasetter or catamal dwaara dijani or piksar donon ke nirikshan kaa yah matlab nahin tha ki dono studio kaa vilay ho rahaa tha
 In fact, additional terms were added to the deal to ensure that Pixar's separate) remains about which analysts expressed concern about in the Disney deal

 The 60-minute film Toy Story 2 was implemented by Disney as a direct-video
 jab dijani ke adhikariyon ne dekha ki anukram kaa pragati-adheen kalpana-chitra kitna prabhaavshaalee tha to unhone faisla kiya ki is par bataur film kaam hona chahie
 As a result, the change in the status of Toy Story 2 became one of the major reasons for differences between the two companies that they reached the brink of a split
 piksar anukram ke khilaaf nahin he lekin unka maananaa he ki yadi kahani mul rup jitani hi acchhee ho tab hi unhen banaaya janaa chahie
 After the release of Toy Story 2, Pixar and Disney reached a civilian agreement that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar even though they had full rights
 vilay ke baad jab lasetter ko dijani or piksar ke sabhi anemation kaa prabharee banaaya gaya to unhone kaha ki sabhi anukram turant roak die jaaen, dijani to yah kehane kii seemaa tak chalaa gaya ki toy story 3 radd kar di gayi he
 Lasseter fueled speculation about future sequels even further when he said, "if the story is good, we'll make a sequel"

 In the early days of ODI cricket, the number of overs per team was usually 60, but now it has been uniformly limited to 50 overs
