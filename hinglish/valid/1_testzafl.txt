 sanskrit kavyashastra main mahakavy kaa pratham sutarabaddh lakshan acharya bhamah ne prastut kiya he or parvarti aacharyon main dandi, rudrat tathaa vishwanath ne apane apane dhang se is mahakavyasootrabaddh ke lakshan kaa vistaar kiya he
 The characterization of Acharya Vishwanath being final in this tradition is available as a summary of all previous views
 mahakavy main bharat ko bharatvarsh athwa bharat kaa desh kaha gaya he tathaa bharat nivaasiyon ko bharti athwa bharat kii santan kaha gaya he According to Acharya Vishwanath, the characteristics of the epic are as follows: acharya vishwanath kaa uparyukt nirupan mahakavy ke swaroop kii vaigyanik evam krambaddh paribhaasha prastut karne ke sthaan par uski pramukh or gaun visheshtaon kaa kramahin vivaran upasthit karata he
 Based on this, the characteristics of the epic available in Sanskrit poetry can be summarized as follows: kathanak - mahakavy kaa kathanak aitihaasik athwa itihasashrith hona chahie
 Explanation - The story should be enriched with various forms and descriptions of life
 ye varnan prakritik, saamaajik or rajithik kshetron se is prakaar sambanddh hone chahie ki inke madhyam se maanav jivan kaa purna chitra uske sampurna vaibhav, vaichitrya evam vistaar ke saath upasthit ho sake
 That is why its dimension should be wide
 vinyas - kathanak kii sanghatana natya sandhiyon ke vidhaan se yukt honi chahie arthath mahakavy ke kathanak kaa vikaas kramik hona chahie
 His official story and other episodes should be interrelated with the upakarya-upakarva-bhava and there should be a proper forethought in them
 nayak - mahakavy kaa nayak devtaa yaa sadrush kshatriya ho, jiskaa charitra dhirodatt gunon se samanvit ho - arthath vah mahaasatva, atyant gambhir, kshamavan aviktthan, sthircharitra, nigudh, ahankaarvan or drudhvrat hona chahie
 The characters should also be specific persons, Rajputs, sages etc
 according to the same
 ras - mahakavy main shringaar, vir, shant evam karun main se kisi ek ras kii sthiti angi rup main tathaa anya rason kii ang rup main hoti he
 The fruit - the epic is described - that is, its tendency towards Shiva and truth and its aim is the attainment of the quadrangle
 style - style ke sandarbh main sanskrit ke aacharyon ne praaia: atyant sthool roodhiyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 For example, the composition of cantos in the same verse and the verses in the sergeant, the division into octagonal cantons, the basis of naming etc
 parantu mahakavy ke anya lakshanon ke alok main yah spasht hi he ki mahakavy kii style nanavarnan kshamaa, vistargarbha, shravy vritton se alankrita, mahapraan honi chahie
 Acharya Bhamah has called this language with the words Salankar, Agramya i
e
 Shishya Nagar language
 mahakavy ke jin lakshanon kaa nirupan bhartiya aacharyon ne kiya, shabdabhed se unheen se milti-julati visheshtaon kaa ullekh pashchim ke aacharyon ne bhi kiya he
 Aristotle compares the tragedy to the epic, stating that "in addition to song and visual acuity, the parts of both are the same
 " arthath mahakavy ke mul tatv chaar hai - kathavstu, charitra, vichaartatv or padaavalee 
 He is of the opinion that mahakavy ke paatro ke sambandh main arestu ne keval itnaa kaha he ki "mahakavy or traasadee main yah samanta he ki usamen bhi ucchtar koti ke paatro kii padhyabaddh anukriti rahati he
 "on the basis of similarity with the characters of the tragedy, it is not difficult to conclude that the characters of the epic must also be equal to the tragedy - gentle, splendid, noble and famous
 rudrat ke anusaar mahakavy main pratinayak or uske kul kaa bhi varnan hota he
 According to Aristotle, the impact and purpose of the epic should also be similar to tragedy, that is, the exertion of emotions, its purpose and tajjani mind: peace should be its effect
 yah prabhaav naitik athwa ragaatmak athwa donon prakaar kaa ho saktaa he
 In the words of Aristotle, the style of the epic is also "the absolute climax is to be happy but not petty
" " arthath garima tathaa prasadgun mahakavy kii style ke mul tatv hai or garima kaa aadhaar he asaadhaaranta
 According to him, the language of the epic should be artistic, sublime and dignified by folkloric experiments, unlike the compassionate ornate style of tragedy
 mahakavy kii rachana ke liye ve aadi se ant tak ek hi chand - vir chand - ke prayog par bal dete hai kyonki uskaa rup anya vritton kii apeksha adhik bhavy evam garimamay hota he jisamen aprachlit evam lakshanik shabd badi saralata se antarbhukt ho jate hai
 Later scholars have also re-mentioned the same characteristics with reference to various elements of the epic, which Acharya Aristotle had mentioned
 virakavy kaa aadhaar sabhi ne jaateey gaurav kii puraakathaon ko sweekaar kiya he
 John Herrington emphasizes the need for a historical ground for Virkavya and Spencer considers splendor and dignity as the basic elements for Virkavya
 france ke kavi aalochakon paletiye, vokalen or ronsar aadi ne bhi mahakavy kii kathavstu ko sarvaadhik garimaayam, bhavy or udaatt karte hue uske antargat aise vaataavaran ke nirmaan kaa aagrah kiya he jo kshudra ghatnaon se mukt evam bhavy ho
 On comparing the above representations of Indian and Western critics, it becomes clear that both in the context of different elements of the epic, the same quality has been repeatedly emphasized and that is - grandeur and dignity, which is the authority Are parts
 vastav main, mahakavy vyakti kii chetana se anupranit na hokar samast yug evam raashtra kii chetana se anupranit hota he
 That is why its basic elements are universal rather than relative in the country - in the absence of which no composition of any country or era can become epic and in whose harmony, despite the constraints of traditional classical traits, any work from the glory of the epic It is not possible to deprive
 ye mul tatv hai - In this way, the object or significance is the life of the epic
 sanskrit mahakavy ke udbhav or vikaas kaa nirupan adhelikhit he- We history the development of the epic in two ways
 rupagat vikaas, shailigat vikaas Vedic period first comes under the form of evolution, in which the narrative, devastuti, sentimentality etc
 comes
 veeramhakavy ke antargat ramayana, mahabharat evam aakhyaan tattvon kii pradhanta aati he
 In the cosmic epic, Kalidas and later poets have emphasized the sublime of the Kalakshapas rather than the Bhavapaksha
 mahakavy ke shailigat vikaas main prasadaatmak style main ramayana, mahabharat, kalidas, ashwaghosh aadi ke kaavyon main praapt hoti he
 The ornamental style is found in poems of Bharavi, Magha, Shriharsha etc
 shleshatmak style, dwayrthak kaavyon main praapt hoti he
 Dvayākāka poetry, Dhyanājānikāta - bivasandhankāvya, kavirajasurikrita-raghavapandavīya, raghavachudamānīkshitākrita-raghavāyādva-pandavīya
 mahakavyon kaa udbhav rugveda ke aakhyaan sookhton- indra, varun, vishnu or usha aadi ke stutimantron tathaa narashansi gaathaon se hua he
 a detailed form of these lectures etc
 is found in the texts of Brahmins etc
 yahi swaroop aage chalakar mahakavy ke rup main badal gaya
 The sad-minded man from Kraunchavadha got the glory of Adi poetry in the form of the vyakha-shap Valmikkrit Ramayana from the voice of Mahakavi Valmiki and its founder Valmiki got the glory of Adikavi
 valmikikrut ramayana tathaa ramayana ke baad vedavyaskrut mahabharat bhi parvarti kaviyon kaa upjivy kavy ban gayi
 Indian tradition considers Vedas to be the origin of poetry, scripture etc
 vaidic manishi kii sarvaadhik manohar kalpanaayen rugveda ke ushas sookhton main samast kaavyatmak unmesh ke saath nikali hui he
 In addition to Devastuti, poetic forms can also be seen in Narashanis
 tatkaaleen udaar raajaaon kii prashansa main nitant atishyoktipurna prashastiyaan narashansi kehalaati he
 In the seventh panchika of Aitareyabrahman, the parts of the Shaunashep narrative and the 'aandamahabhishek' in the eight panchika give a glimpse of beautiful poetry
 is prakaar sampoorn vaidic sahitya main kavyatattvon kaa astitva to drushtigochar hota he kintu mahakavy style kaa purna paripaak kahin par bhi drushtigochar nahin hota
 The original origin of the Sanskrit epic Dhara is Adikavya Ramayana, in which all the characteristics of the epic are seen
 sanskrit sahitya ke mahakavyon kii vikaas-parampara main sanskrit vyakaran ke ‘munitray’ - panini, vararuchi tathaa patanjali kaa sthaan atyadhik mahatvapurn he
 Nemisadhu, the commentator of the 'kavyalankar Sutra' composed by Acharya Rudrat, mentions the epic 'jambavatijaya' or 'patalavijaya' composed by Panini
 patanjali ke mahabhashya main kavyagunon se sampann padya uplabdh hote hai
 Based on all these evidences, the epic had emerged by Panini in the eighth century BC
 sookhtigranthon main rajasekhar ne panini ko ‘vyakaran’ tathaa ‘jambavatijay’ donon kaa rachayita mana he- Many verses, also known as Varruchi, are found in various well-defined collections
 patanjali ne vararuchi ke banaaye gayi kisi mahakavy kaa ullekh mahabharat main kiya he- The name of the varruchi-praneet epic is 'kanthabharan'
 vararuchi ne panini kaa anukaran ‘vaarthik’ likhakar hi nahin kiya pratyut kavyrachana se uski purti kii
 Patanjali cited many shlokas or shlokkhandas as illustrations in his great language whose practice proves the antiquity of sanskrit-kavyadhara
 kavy apane sundar nirmaan tathaa rachana ke nimitt shant vaataavaran, aarthik samruddhi tathaa saamaajik shaanti kii jitani apeksha rakhata he utani hi vah kisi gungrahi ashrayadata kii prerana kii bhi
 In the history of ancient India, he is the historical founder of the Malav Samvat, the founder of the Indian people, religion and culture, from the fierce attacks of the Yuga Shakas, to the Shakari Malvaganadhyaya Vikramaditya
 isi yug main bhartiya samskruti ke upaask kalidas kaa kavyakaash main udai hota he
 Kalidas can truly be called the originator of adult, sophisticated, Pranjal and manic poetry
 kalidasji ne jo kavyadarsh upasthit kiya vah parkaalin kaviyon evam lekhakon ke liye anukaraniya hue
 The Sanskrit epic can be divided into three groups- vidwaanon ne kalidas ke purvavarti kavi vyas or valmiki ko rishikoti main mana he
 His creations have a blend of simplicity and naturalness
 sanskrit saahityakaash main mahakavi ‘bharavi’ kaa naam vishesh ullekhneey rahegaa kyonki sanskrit ke mahakavyon kii parampara main samay or kavitv donon drushtiyon se kalidas ke shad bharavi kaa pramukh sthaan he
 One of his volume is the classic epic 'kiratarjuniyam' which became popular in scholarly circles for its expressive utterances
 iske shad usee str kaa mahatvapurn mahakavy magh kaa ‘shishupalavadhm’ he
 According to chronology in the tradition of Sanskrit epics, the last and most important poem in the late twelfth century is the 'naashadhicharitam' of Mahakavi Shree Harsha
 inhone apane mahakavy ko tatkaaleen samaaj main prachlit parampara ke anuroop hi aage badhaayaa or us style ke vikaas ko charam tak pahunchaa diya
 In short, a look at the development of the epic shows that in the early era, naturalism was valued only in poetry, the same quality was seen with respect
 kaalaantar main kaviyon ne apane kavy main aksharadambar tathaa anlkaravinyas kii ore drushtipaat kiya or unhen hi kavy kaa jivan maanane lage
 Raghuvansh, Kumarasambhava, Kiratarjuniyam, Shishupalavadh and Naishcharcharit are called 'panchamahakaavya'

 Rashmirathi, meaning "charioteer of the sun", is a famous Khandakavya composed by the great Hindi poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar
 yah 1952 main prakashit hua tha
 It has 7 cantos
 isamen karn ke charitra ke sabhi pakshon kaa sajiv chithran kiya gaya he
 In Rashmirathi, Dinkar elevated Karna from the Mahabharata story and raised him to a new land of morality and credibility and honored him with pride
 rashmirathi main dinakar ne saare saamaajik or paariwarik sambandhon ko nae sire se jaanchaa he
 Whether it is on the pretext of guru-disciple relations, whether on the pretext of unmarried motherhood and married motherhood, whether on the pretext of religion, on the pretext of deceit and deceit
 yuddh main bhi manushya ke unche gunon kii pahchaan ke prati lalak kaa kavy he ‘rashmirathi’
 'rashmirathi' also gives the message that birth-illegality does not destroy the legitimacy of karma
 apane karmon se manushya mrityu-purv janm main hi ek or janm le letaa he
 Ultimately, an assessable man is judged not by his lineage, but by his conduct and deeds
 dinakar main rashtrawaad ke saath-saath dalit mukti chetana kaa bhi swar he, rashmirathi iskaa pramaan he
 In Dinkar's own words, the salvation of Karna's character is in some way an attempt to establish a new humanity
 hindi ke chhayavadottar yug kii anupam uplabdhi main dinakar va bachchan hai
 Even among ordinary Hindi readers, Dinkar's vigorous poems instilled new interest and new enthusiasm
 unki kavitaaon kaa pradhan swar anyaay ke prati aakrosh kaa he
 To express his indignation for the injustice done to the institutionalized society in society, Dinkar was looking for a hero who, apart from being lofty, was essentially mighty
 mahabharat ke karn main unhen maanas pariklpit nayak kaa samroop mil gaya
 In the Mahabharata, the express expressions towards Shri Krishna's Karna are noted - ojasvi kavita kii rachana main ramane vaale dinakar kaa man tejasvi karn ke vyaktitv se sahaj hi abhibhoot ho gaya
 Yuyutsa and struggle were integral parts of Karna's personality
 vaiyaktikta kaa nishedh karne vaali varna vyavastha ke prati karn ke sangharsh kaa armbh kishoravastha se hi ho jaataa he
 The possibility of being a great warrior inside Kishore Karna was present in the seed
 is sambhaavna ko vinasht karne kii ek naakaam koshish dronacharya dwaara karn ko shishy rup main asweekaar kiya janaa thi
 But Karna was born with the life of the vegetation of the desert, which absorb moisture even from the sand
 gyaan par ekadhikaar kii kapat krida kaa pratirodh kishor karn parashuram ke samaksh apane vaastavik parichay ko gopan rakhkar karata he
 This 'untruth' of Kishore Karna was insignificant compared to the cruel truth of the prevailing system, yet Karna became a part of the curse
 vaiyaktikta or vyaktitv ke hanan kii ye dushcheshtaayen vartmaan kaal ke liye sarvatha apraasangik hon, so baat nahin
 Yes, the fragrance of change must be visible
 swayan dinakar ke shabdon main -‘aage manushya keval usee pad kaa adhikari hoga jo uske samarthy se suchit hota he, us pad kaa nahin jo uske mata-pita yaa vansh kii dein he
 Similarly, due to their personal qualities, the post which they are entitled to will not be able to obstruct it
 karn-charit kaa uddhaar ek tarah se nayi bhaavana kii sthapana kaa hi prayaas he
 Karna's Dalit self-assertion challenges the root norms of the entire system on the pretext of challenging Arjuna in puberty - karn ke jaateey parichay kii aad main kripacharya dwaara jab vaiyaktikta ke udghosh ke swar ko shamit karne kaa punah prayaas hota he to karn kaa sanchit aakrosh foot padataa he- Dinkar considered the sympathy of the whole world to be a part of his heart
 unheen ke shabdon main dekhie -‘‘bharat kaa man rashtriya kam, antararashtriya adhik rahaa he
 Nevertheless, to get rid of slavery, we accepted the national adjective, only in the sense that without the awakening of nationalism, the end of slavery is impossible
 ’’ kavi raashtra kii seemaa ko bhi sweekaar nahin karnaa chahta or yah us sareekhe mahaan kavi ke liye swaabhaavik hi he kyonki vistaar hi jivan he or sankuchan mrityu
 By the expansion of the heart, the ability of empathy of the sadist comes into the human being and only then he is able to emit his whole self without craving for vindictiveness
 daan isi vistaar kaa vyavhaar main aanshik roopayan he
 Dinkar's ability to donate is the most prominent feature of the sublime character
 yah kshamta sansar main virale logon main hi paayi jaati he
 Atmabali is the conqueror of its own part but it is more self-sacrificing to give peace to others
 karn aise virale atmbaliyon main se ek tha
 Even after sensing the treacherous intent of Devraj Indra, he says: karn kaa yah jaanboojhkar ‘chalaa janaa’ uske charitra ko or ujjwal banaata he
 This valor of Karna also changes Indra's heart and he is forced to give Karna a fire
 karn-kunti prasang main dinakar ne karn ko upekshit putr kii bhoomika main rakhaa he
 Due to the harsh neglect of the mother, Karna is forced to live a stubborn life
 atev is prasang main mata dwaara apratyaashit sneh ke pradarshan par uskaa sanchit vikshobh foot padataa he
 But Karna is by nature a benevolent person whose love is on everyone and whose compassion is towards everyone
 phir janani ke prati vah kab tak kathor rah saktaa tha
 Karna decides to not kill all the brothers except Arjuna in the war, meaning subsistence of friend-religion
 daan ke atirikt kritagyata bhi shreshth purushon main paayi jaati he
 The voluntary assistance also becomes invaluable if it is done at the right time, then Duryodhana then declared him the king of Anga Pradesh in order to revive Karna, who was stunned by the sharp arrows of satire
 kritagyata or mitra ke prati prem ke vasheebhoot hokar hi karn kunti ke aagrah ko thukraata hua kahata he - Despite being with Duryodhana, perhaps due to being driven by a sense of duty of gratitude, Karna's personality does not fade even a little
 draupadi kaa chiraharan hi ek aisa prasang he jahaan karn kaa aahat abhimaan use nari kii asmita kii raksha ke liye virodh kaa swar bhi mukherit nahin karne detaa
 Dinkar has tried to wash away the stigma by expressing remorse to Karna in the context of the karna-arjuna war
 draupadi cheer haran ke prasang ko chhod diya jaye to karn kaa charitra sarvatha nishkalank he
 By the time Karna became the commander in the war, the war had become disgusting with the encroachment of all dignities, but Karna tries to establish dignity again
 nagvansha ke sarp ashwasen ke uske tunir par savaar ho arjuna ko dansane dene ke aagrah ko asweekaar karata hua vah kahata he - Karna did not take shelter of unrighteousness, but Arjuna, listening to the ethic Krishna said, must have taken shelter of unrighteousness
 karn ke rath kaa pahiyaa pank main fas gaya or nihshastr, pahiyaa nikaalte karn ko arjuna ne apane baanon se bindh daalaa
 The sun in Karna's life set in this way, but the brilliance of his glory will continue to ring the society for eternity to narrate the majesty of the individual
 dinakar karn-charit ke uddhaar ke madhyam se apane abhisht kii arthath naveen jivan mulyon kii sthapana main kitna safal ho sake hai
