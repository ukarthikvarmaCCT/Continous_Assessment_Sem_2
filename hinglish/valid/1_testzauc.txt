 Former Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh jaivopachaaran, kii paribhaasha ke anusaar yah ek aisi prakriya he jisamen, sookshmjivon jaise jeevanuon yaa unke anzimon kaa upyog karke kisi sandooshit ho chuke paryaavaran ko pun: uski mul sthiti main laane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 The use of bioremediation, certain contaminants such as chlorinated pesticides that are degraded by bacteria, or in general oil spill conditions where many techniques are used for the decomposition of crude oil, including bacteria using fertilizers This involves accelerating the process of crude oil decomposition
 saadhaaran shabdon main jaivopachaaran ek aisi vidhi he jisamen sookshmjivon kaa prayog karke kisi pradooshit ho chuke paryaavaran ko prakritik rup se uskaa mul swaroop pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Bacteria, fungi, protists and other microorganisms are constantly engaged in decomposition of organic matter in an unpolluted environment
 jab yah paryaavaran kisi carbonic pradooshak jaise ki kaccha tel, dwaara pradooshit kiya jaataa he to kuch sookshmjeev to mar jate hai par kuch anya sookshm jeev jo is bahari pradooshak ko bhi apaghatit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai, batch jate hai
 Through bioremediation, the number of these remaining microorganisms is increased rapidly by providing fertilizer, oxygen and other favorable conditions
 anukool paristhitiyon ke chalate in sookshmjivon kii sankhya main teji se vruddhi hoti he jiske parinamswaroop baahar se aaye carbonic pradooshak kaa apghaton bhi twarit gati se hota he
 To deal with most cases of oil spills, the method of bioremediation is used
 kisi pradooshit paryaavaran ko pun: uski mul sthiti main pahunchaane ke liye do main se ek tarika istemaal main laayaa jaataa he
 In the example given above, measures are taken to increase the number of microorganisms left, and secondly, special microorganisms are brought from outside and entered into this environment so that the decomposition of pollutants takes place at a rapid rate
 
 Bioremediation is a good strategy to deal with some types of pollution, but it is not an effective solution in treating every type of pollution
 un sthanon jahaan mukhya pradooshak aise rasayan hon jo lagbhag sabhi prakaar ke sookshmjivon ke liye vifaille hon vahaan, jaivopachaaran dwaara pradooshan se mukti paanaa sambhav nahin he
 These chemicals include various metals such as cadmium and lead and salts such as sodium chloride
 is sabake baavjood, jaivopachaaran prakritik rup se hone vaali apghaton kii kriya ko twarit gati pradaan kar pradushan se nipatane kii ek acchhee yukti pradaan karata he
 According to location and pollutants, bioremediation proves to be a safer and cheaper method than other alternative measures, such as burning or filling of polluted substances with lower locations
 iske dwaara pradooshit sthaan par hi pradooshan kaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he or iske liye mitti yaa talachat ko khod kar hataane yaa pani ko pump kar baahar nikaalane kii jarurat nahin padati

 Because of leaving, all the soldiers strayed from each other

 The deer slowly disappeared from the eyes of Bhim Singh Chauhan
 jab tak raja ke sabhi sainik raja se rasta bhatak chuke the
 Bhimsingh Chauhan looked around but no soldiers were near him and started searching for the source of water because he was very thirsty
 bahut koshish ke baad bhi jab pani nahin mila to bhimsingh chouhan moorchhit hokar jangalon main gir pade
 Bhimsingh began to see the same statue in the foothills below
 tabhi achaanak bhayankar barish hone lagi evam megh garajane lage va bijli kadakane lagi, jab raja kii barish ke kaaran murchha tuuti to raja dekhtaa he ki chaaron taraf pani hi pani najar aayaa, raja ne pehle pani piya or dekha ki ek balika andhkaar bhari raat main swayan surya jaisi prakashmay ujjwal bal rup main kanya khelti najar ai
 bhimsingh chouhan us kanya ko dekhakar thodaa bhaybheet hua or bolaa ki he bala is jangal main tum akeli kya kar rahi ho? tumhaare maan baap kahan par he, raja kii baat ko sunakar nanhee balika hansane lagi or totari vaani main boli ki he rajan tum yah bataao kii tumhaari pyaas buji yaa nahin, itnaa kahkar bhagwati apane asli rup main aa gai, itnaa hote hi raja maan ke charnon main gir gaya or bolaa he adishkti mahamaya mujhe aap se kuch nahin chahie agar aap mujh par khush ho to hamaare kshetra main aap hameshaa nivas karen ! raja bhimsingh chouhan ko mata chouth ne kahan he rajan tumhaari ichha puri hogi, yah kahkar bhagwati shivamaya antardhyaan ho gai

 Mimamsa Darshan is one of the six Darshans of Hindus
 paksh-pratipaksh ko lekar vedavakyon ke nirnit arth ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 The above idea is from the earlier Aryan tradition
 kintu aaj se praaia: sava paanch hajaar varsh purv samaveda ke acharya krishna dwaipayan ke shishy ne use sutarabaddh kiya
 The sutras refer to Badarayana, Badari, Atreya, Ashmarathya, Drafting, Etishayan, Kamukayan, Kartajajini and Labukayana Maharshias as complete aspects and principles, which are detailed in the annotations and discourses of the sutras, which have become millennials
 
 is shaastra kaa purvamimasaa ar veydant kaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Purmimamsa, there is the idea of religion and in Uttara Mimamsa there is the idea of brahma
 atah purvamimasaa kaa dharmamimasaa ar uttar mimasaa kaa brahmamimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 From the sutra composed by Jaimini Muni, Mimamsa is called Jaminian Dharmamimamsa
 german vidwaan maxmooler kaa kahana he ki - "yah darshan shaastra koti main nahin aa saktaa, kyonki isamen dharmanushthan kaa hi vivechan kiya gaya he
 There is no discussion of Jiva, God, Bandha, Moksha and their means anywhere
 " Some Indian scholars who are biased to Maxmuller's opinion also hesitate to call it philosophy, because in the Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta the evidence and theorems in the then cases are mainly about the soul-self, Bandha-moksha etc
 Discretion is received, the same philosophy is not visible in the formulas, commentary and talk etc
 uparyukt vichaarkon ne sthool buddhi se granth kaa adhyayan kar apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 Yet it is clear that the philosophy of Mimamsa is the contributory cause of all philosophies
 jaimini ne in vishyon kaa beej rup se apane sutron main upanyaas kiya he "satsamprayoge purushasyendriyanaa buddhi janm tat pratyakshm" chaturth sutara main do shabd aae hai - purush or buddhi
 The word "soul" differs from the male word
 yah arth kumaril bhatta ne "bhaattdipika" main likhaa he
 The word wisdom has conveyed the meaning of knowledge, pramata, theorem and proof
 vrittikaar ne "tasya nimitt parishti:" paryat teen sutron main pratyaksh, anumaan shabd, arthapati or anuplabdhi pramaanon kaa saparikar vishad vivechan tathaa autpattik sutara main aatmavaad kaa vishesh vivechan apane vyaakhyaan main kiya he
 The same has been analyzed in texts like Shabar Bhashya, Shloka Vartik, Shastradipika, Bhatt Chintamani, etc
, wherein there is a distinction between proofs and theorems, Bandha, Moksha and their means
 mimasaa darshan main bharatvarsh ke mukhya prandhan dharm kaa varnashram vyavastha, aadhanadi, ashwamedhant aadi vichaaron kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Often, knowledgeable and disinterested men have been everywhere in the world, but the learned philosophers of rituals and rituals of rituals have been learned in India only
 inamen katyayan, aashvalyan, aapstamb, bodhayan, gautam aadi maharishiyon ke granth aaj bhi uplabdh hai
 
 bhartiya karmkand siddhant kaa pratidaan or samarthan isi darshan main praapt hota he
 Dr
 Kunnan Raja has aptly portrayed this in the role of the second edition of "brihati"
 yadhyapi kanad muni krit vaisheshik darshan main dharm kaa namatah ullekh praapt hota he - tathaapi uske vishay main aage vichaar nahin kiya gaya he
 a scholar says - arthath jaise koi manushya samudr paryant jane kii ichha rakhte hue himalay main chalaa jaataa he, usee prakaar dharm ke vyaakhyaan ke icchhuk kanad muni shat padaarthon kaa vivechan karte rah gaye
 Answer: According to the principle of epistemology, right to attain enlightenment is only after the deed, but according to the earlier epistemology philosophy - is vedamantra ke anusaar mumukshu janon ko bhi karm karnaa chahie
 By performing Vedic Karma, the Karmbandhan is automatically terminated - Tasmanmumukhubhi: Karya is the main soul of Indian theistic philosophies according to the verses of Nityamtikam and “adi”
 mimasaa darshan solah adhyyon kaa he, jisamen baarah adhyay krambaddh hai
 Shastra Sangathi is associated with Adhyatagati, Padasangati and Adhyakanti
 in baarah adhyyon main jo chhot gaya he, uskaa nirupan shesh chaar adhyyon main kiya gaya he jo 'sankarshcand' ke naam se prasiddh he
 It discusses the authority of the deity
 at: use 'devtaa cond' bhi kehete hai athwa dwadash adhyyon kaa parishisht bhi kah sakate hai
 Bhaskar Rai Dixit has written at the end of the interpretation of the Sankarshan case that despite reading Shodasadhyayi Mimamsa, the reading was in Dvadashadhyay only in the medieval period
 jis tarah chatushpada gayatri ke rahane par bhi vidvan varg tripada gayatri ko hi japate hai, usee tarah vartmaan kaal main dwadashadhyaayi mimasaa kaa hi adhyayan adhyaapan prachlit he
 According to some scholars, it is difficult to decide the meaning of a sentence without epistemology, because such a sentence is evidence in the present sense or in other sense, the conclusion which comes in the decision of this idea is called epistemology, but here the meaning of the word epistemology is from philosophy
 is
 dharmagyaan ke liye paraspar virodh rahit vedamantron ke arthon ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 And thoughtfully received theology is the result of epistemology
 yahi baat jaimini ne apane mimasaa darshan main kahi he - athato dharm jigyaasa

 kumaril bhatta ne ise is prakaar varnan kiya he - Further sentence-wise decision-making millennium judgments are described
 yahan tak chah adhyyon kaa sankshipt vishyanirdesh kiya gaya
 In this philosophy, one gets knowledge of duty-abstention from Veda-sentence-decision by considering the objective predicate sentiment obtained from judicious judgment, or from the combustible combustion justice
 isliye dharmagyaan hi mimasaa darshan kaa prayojan he
 In this philosophy there is an undertaking from theology
 vyakaran ke liye "padashastra", vaisheshik nyaay ke liye "pramanshastra" or mimasaa ke liye "vaakyashastra" kaa prayog sanskrit sahitya main hota he
 There is a discussion of religious thought in this scripture
 bhartiya janata kaa mukhya uddeshy dharmanushthan he
 Ritual cannot happen without fruit and fruitfulness cannot be without material means
 at: sankshep main saadhan kaa bhi vivechan kiya jaataa he
 It is necessary to know the symptoms, evidence and means of religion before the ritual
 is shaastra main saadhan, ang or shesh, ye teenon paryaayavachak shabd hai
 Likewise, these three synonyms are Sdhya, Seshi and Angi
 udhaaharan ke liye swargaprapti ke nimitt darsh poornmaas kaa anushthan yadi karnaa ho to usamen darsh or poornmaas angi honge or prayaaj aadi ang honge
 Darsha Yag occurs on Amavasya Tithi and Purnamas Yag occurs on Purnima Tithi
 ) isamen angi pradhan ang kaa prayojak he or ang prayojya he
 In this way, knowing the means of getting the religious ritual requires knowledge of purvaparya as well and in the case of ritualistic agni hotradi karmas for fruits, there is also a discussion of the means of Purvanga and Uttaranga, for which the word "nature" is used
 kintu sauryadi karmke sannidhi main ang kaa paath nahin he
 After the emergence of aspiration at that place, one has to take the organs which are presented in the Darshan Purnamas, which is called as an excess 
 Normally, even if there is a decision, the description of which karma comes in which karma comes, it has been explained by the special instructions
 angon kaa atidesh hone par bhi prakruti main bhed hone ke kaaran praakrit pad ke sthaan par padaantar ko rakhkar paath kiya jaataa he
 For example "agneya tva jushtam nirvapami"
 is shrutivakya main agni pad ke sthaan main "sauryoyeshti" ke suryapad rakhkar "suryaay tvajushta nirvpaami" is shruti ko padhate hai
 Such a sentence is called "ooh"
 in baton ke gyaan bina yah samaj lenaa sambhav nahin he ki kis ang kaa kahan or kaise upyog karnaa chahie jisase anushthan samuchit faldaayak ho sake
 The place where the organ is not read, the organ should be brought from other place, but only those who can do the treatment of deformity can be taken in nature
 jo vikruti main upkaar nahin kar sakate vahaan anya angon kaa adhyaahar nahin hota
 And they do not even have rituals
 aise vachanon ko "baadh" kehete hai
 The decision of which part is obstructed and whose not is subject to "ooh" obstruction
 evam abhipsit faldaata karm ek hi hota he
 But there are many anywhere
 kuch angon kaa anushthan pradhan se purv tathaa kuch kaa pradhan ke pashchaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 For example, Samidheni Prayajadi and a specific follower
 ek hi samay par un angon kaa ek baar athwa anek baar prayog karne ke vishay main kaha gaya he - The name for using once is Tantra and the name for multiple times is "frequency" or "movement"
 kahin kahin angon kaa tantra se anushthan hota he or kahin kahin aavriti se
 Therefore the idea of tantra and movement is also necessary
 kisi fal vishesh ke liye pradhan angi kaa anushthan karte hai or uske angon ko bhi karte hai
 Those organs which require the use of other organs also need to be referred to as context
 isamen pradhan tantri hota he, jise prasang kehete hai
 For example, the Agnostic animal Purodshadi, the perfected person of the aforesaid subjects, can only perform the Sangopang Dharmanasthana, which is explained by Jamini in "mimamsa Darshan"
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samathrya kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, text, place, main and tendency
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 The ninth chapter represents three types of "oohs" with the distinction of mantroh, samoah and samskarah
 dashamadhyay main arthlope, pratyamnaay or pratishedh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke baadh kaa nirupan hai
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus one subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashalini"
 yahan lakshan shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 anek sutron se ek adhikaran banataa he, jisamen ek pradhan sutara tathaa anya gun sutara hote hai
 The principal sutra presupposes the antecedent and the other sutras form the principle
 kahin kahin par do sutron ke dwaara purvottar paksh kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 In such a way, the principle has been formulated by raising the former side without the formula
 kahin kahin siddhant rup se upkram dwaara purv paksh kar siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 There are certain tribunals in a foot
 udaahranarth pratham paad main aath adhikaran hai
 The Tribunal has six substances - subject, doubt, antecedent, principle purpose and consistency
 sangati teen prakaar kii hoti he - shaastra sangati, adhyay sangati or paad sangati
 First Sutra - The name of the first tribunal is the curiosity tribunal
 vichaar shaastra vishay he
 There is doubt as to whether or not the idea is worth starting
 aarambh karne yogya nahin he, yah purv paksh he
 The theory is that thought science should be started
 is vishay kaa mul he kumaril bhatta ke mat main adhyayan vidhi or "prabhakar" mat main adhyaapan vidhi
 On the east side there is the invisible purpose of study and in the theory side, the meaning-knowledge-form is the objective view
 dharm ke vichaar shaastra sambandhi hone ke kaaran is vichaar shaastra main iskaa vivechan sangat he
 In this tribunal, study is parable, this has been proved
 atev vichaar shaastra kaa mul adhyayan vidhi he
 The means of semantics is obscured by the study method
 isiilie vichaar shaastra kaa aarambh vaid he
 Second Sutra - The Second Tribunal has the character and proof of religion, whose duty is reflected in the law
 vah shrey kaa saadhan he
 Here the word Shraya means both physical and spiritual meaning
 gamy dharm main gamak vidhivaakya pramaan hota he
 That which is propounded by prohibition is a means of evil, it is called unrighteousness
 tritiy sutara - tritiy adhikaran main vidhi vaakya hi pramaan he
 Only pledge is done here
 ve do prakaar kahi hai - "chodanaiv lakshann yasya, chodana lakshanmev yasya" arthath yahan pratyaksh aadi pramaan dharm se pramaan nahin hote, kintu vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan mana gaya he
 Fourth Sutra - This Sutra has the fourth tribunal to support the first pledge
 is adhikaran main lok siddh pratyaksh pramaan kaa lakshan - "indriarthsannikarshajanyan gyaanan pratyakshm"
 That is, the direct takes on the present approximate and the religion is originating, so there can be no proof in the direct religion, because the religion is future
 in vachanon se mimasaakaar ne pratyakshopjivi anumaan ushmaan or arthapatti ko bhi pramaan nahin mana he
 Pancham Sutra - The fourth sutra is supported by the fifth curse of the fifth sutra by supporting the first curiosity of the fourth tribunal
 is adhikaran main vidhivaakya hi pramaan he, isi pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 In this context, the authenticity of proofs is automatically generated and accepted automatically
 arthath gyanjanak saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or usee saamagree se pramanya gruhit bhi hota he
 Sentences are of two types - cosmic and Vedic
 loukik vaakya paurushey hone ke kaaran purushgat bhram, pramaad, vipralambh, karnapatav aadi dosha se yukt hota he, atev paurushey vaakya pramaan nahin hota
 The mantra is the Brahminical word Veda Apaurusheya
 at: vidhivaakya main apramanya ke kaaran bhramaadi nahin hone se vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan hai
 To support this second promise, the sign of the proof and the relation of the word is continual
 baadaraayan ne bhi pramanya main parapeksha ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 In substance-rendering, there is a relation between matter by word, in scripture-rendering, and in composition by man
 shabd or arth kaa vachya-vaachak-sambandh nity maanakar veda main purush-pravesh kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 That is, the Vedas are penned by the Purusha - the reason for saying this is that we have never heard, read or known the sentences without the person
 jabaki mimasakon ke mat main shabd tathaa uske dwaara pratipaadya ghatapatadi-arth kaa sambandh nity he
 Therefore, 'this verse explains this meaning' - even if we do not know this verse, the verse itself tells its performance
 arthath shaktigrah na hone par bhi pad main pratipaadansamrthy he hi
 And there is a tendency for the authorization to separate the male relation by the syntactic relation
 is adhikaran main yatha pad kii padaarth main shakti hoti he, vaise hi vaakya kii vaakyarth main shakti hoti he, aise jo pratipaadan karte hai uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, kyonki pad se upasthit padaarth hi aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti se anvit hokar anshatray vishisht bhaavnarup vaakyarth kaa pratipaadan karata he
 The grammaticalization is governed by the syntactic syntax
 is mat ke anusaar shabdabodh main padaarthon kaa paraspar sambandh sansarg maryaada se bhaasata he
 This is the opinion of the Naiyayikas, which connotes the separation of power in the sentence, but Kumaril Bhatt has supported the designation
 prabhakar ne anvitabhidhan kaa samarthan kiya he
 In this way, the male clause in the sentence is repealed in the second way
 tritiy prakaar granth rachana dwaara hota he
 The reference sentence has a relationship with the man in two ways, one by the katru-karma-bhava-relation and the second by the applied-discourse-bhava-relation
 pravachan sarsaadhaaran or rachana asaadhaaran hoti he
 Is an extraordinary adjective
 atev veda paurushey he
 According to some scholars, the Vedas are called Purusparnait or Pourusheya due to the instructions of man, country, river, tree etc
 in the Vedas, but according to Mimamsa philosophy the discourse is also considered extraordinary
 udaahranarth "kathsamhita" athwa "kath brahman" ke vishay main kinvadanti he ki anek shakha adhyayiyon ke madhya "ksht" maharishi ne purna rup se adhyayan kiya tha
 It is for the second that the name of man, river, etc
 comes in the Vedas, this also proves the Veda Pourusheya, but this imagination is not clever-wise-prescribing; Because often the names of worldly things have come from the Vedas, the tradition of folk-names has gone on from that point of view
 arthath veda itihaas ko anitya nahin maanata, kintu itihaas ke nityatv kaa pratipaadan karata he, iskaa vistrut vivechan mimasaa ke "shabarabhashya" main drushtavy he
 The regular subject and sentence or word are seen in the earliest Brahmarsigan Samadhi, so the Vedas do not include the image of the forefathers
 " loukik rachanaayen purush vishesh kartrutv hone ke kaaran paurushey hai, yatha mahabharat, ramayana aadi
 According to Kumaril Bhatt, the study tradition is eternal
 atev veda bhi apaurushey hai
 Such tribunal principle cannot be related to justice only through the creation of Vedas, hence the sentence is the proof in religion
 mimasaa-darshan main aatm-tatv kaa pratipadak koi bhi moulik sutara nahin he
 Although Shankaracharya wrote that "pre-tantra" does not contain self-effulgent formulas, he has described the form of self by saying this utterance, in Uttamimamsa's "an Evatman: Sharire Bhavat"
 vrittikaar mat ko pramaan rup se uddhrut karte hue likhaa he : "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvan tathaa sharirake vakshyam:"
 The idea is that Purvimamsa, like Uttara Mimamsa, is formed by believing the Advaita soul, however, Purvimamsa is practiced only by considering the subject-subservient self-realization in addition to the body, because Karma-siddhanta consists of "gratitude" and "inattention
" or yaheen se punarjanm aadi kii siddhi bhi hoti he
 "chodna Resume:" "satsamprayogay Purushyendriyamam" Atmabija is rendered from both these sutras
 or vapan aadi sanskaar fali kaa sanskaar he
 In Purusharth, the soul gets fruit from the word Yajna and Krit Yag with the word Purush
 shabar swami ne sutara vishesh ke bina hi "yagyaayudh vaakya" ko nimitt maanakar anaatmavaadi ke mat kaa khandan karte hue aatmaswaroop ko tark or shrutiyon ke dwaara siddh kiya he jisase veda pramanya kii bhi siddhi hoti he
 In post-epistemology, the soul is considered one; But in "samkhya Yoga", justice, vahesika, and premeditation, the soul is considered many, which through karma is related to body, sense and mind
 atev sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandha kaha gaya he
 The above triad puts the soul in bondage, so that the soul suffers a pleasant face: Khadi duality
 nity naimitthik karmon ko katrtavya buddhaya karte hue praarabdh karmon ko jeev bhogata rahata he
 Apart from the body sense, the person who worships the soul with the Brahman intellect has no reason for connection with the sense body, etc
 Such a person becomes self-possessed after the destruction of the present body
 uttarmimasaa ke anusaar sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandhan kaha gaya he jo agyaan kaa kaaran he; uski nivritti hi moksh he
 For example - " nivritiratma mohasy gyatatvenoplakshith: The foreshadowing also accepts that the relation of body, senses and subjects is bondage, and its merger is salvation, whose means, knowledge and action are combined
 atmagyaan do prakaar kaa hota he
 Sharatritik is part of the season of enlightenment, which is free from harmony
 vaidic or loukik vaakyon kaa sahasron kii sankhya main vaakyarth nirnyopayogi nyaayon kaa purvamimasaa ne hi pratipaadan kiya he
 Therefore, the first place in Indian philosophies is that of karma exponent of premodern philosophy
 uttarmimasaa agyaan se sristi or atmagyaan se sristi kaa vinaash maanata he
 Justice, Vaiseshika philosophy has called the destruction of the Mahakrishti till Mahakruti and the destruction of the nuclear atom by Mahabhutla in the double order
 arthath sampurna bhav kaary dvanukadi kram se utpann hote hai or sthool se parmaanu paryant jaakar nasht ho jate hai
 The five atoms of earth, water, light and air are continual in the Panch Mahabhutas
 akaash swayan hi nity he, kintu purv mimasaa ke anusaar do prakaar kii sristi or teen prakaar ke pralay hote hai, jinamein mahasrishti or khand sristi shabd se do sristi kahi gai he
 Three dooms have been called in the same way with the words Pralaya, Mahapralaya and Khanda Pralaya
 unamem khand sristi or khand pralay aajkal ke samaan hi mana gaya he
 For example, a particular site gets destroyed due to earthquake etc
 and somewhere new things are created
 mahasrishti main parmaanuon se dvanukadi dwaara panchmahabhoot paryant navagrahadikon kii sristi hoti he, jiskaa ullekh rugveda ke dasham mandal main praapt hota he - In Matsyapuranadi, one also gets a description of the status of the substances present under the block catastrophe, but former epistemology does not accept Mahasruti and Mahapralaya
 uske anusaar sabhi padaarthon ke naash main koi bhi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 As the narrator has said - mimasaa darshan khand sristi or khand pralay ko hi maanata he
 In Indian six-believer philosophies, the seekers of justice, Vaiseshika and Vedanta are often the same
 udaahranarth "yato vaa imani bhutani jaayante", "dyavabhumi janayan dev ek:" "vishwasya katrta bhuvnsy gopta" in shrutiyon ke dwaara or "janmadyasya yat:" is vedant sutara ke dwaara ishwar kii siddhi hoti he
 Similarly, God has also been proved by the "kshitankuradik Kartajranya Karyavat Ghatavat" conjecture in the jurisprudence, but the Vedantis have proved God by the Shrutis as their cooperative reason
 or naiyayikon ne anumaan se ishwar ke siddh kar shrutiyon ko sahakaari kaaran mana he
 There are two views in Sankhya philosophy - Sesvara and Nirishwar
 seshwar sankhyavaadee ishwar ko maanate hai, kintu use purush vishesh shabd se vyavhaar karte hai
 The Niraश्वरvara Samāhākāvī करतेa denies God, "but the science monk has accepted God by referring to the verse" Ishvarasiddhe: "in this sutra as" proof
 mimasaa darshan naiyayikon ke samaan vidhi mukh se ishwar kaa samarthan ar nirishwar sankhyavaadiyon ke samaan nishedh bhi nahin karata, kintu "sambandhakshepaprihaar" granth main kumaril bhatta ne shabdaarth ke sambandh kaa karta ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he
 The idea is that the subject of the relationship is not God
 uparyukt vachanon ko sweekaar kar lokprasiddhi he ki mimasak nirishvaravaadi he
 The commentators like Kumaril Bhatt, Nandishwar etc
 have disposed of the supposed God and accepted the Vedasiddha God
 vastutah mimasaa veda se siddh brahm athwa ishwar ko sweekaar karata hi he
 Because the Mimamsa philosophy considers the Veda to be an automatic proof
 mimasaa kaa purvamimasaa ar veydantka uttarmimasaa naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, the principle of Vedanta's philosophy and the principles of Vedanta are valid, it is clear
 vedavihit yagadi karm dravya or devtaa in do se saadhy hai
 The substance is Dadhyadi and the deity is Shastraka Samadhigamgya
 arthath vidhi vaakya jisko devtaa kahata he use hi devtaa mana jaataa he
 Here three aspects about the deity have been accepted in Dasamadhyay's Chaturthpad and in Shabar Bhashya etc
 texts
 arth devtaa, shabd vishisht arth devtaa or shabd devtaa hai
 The last aspect in all three is the principle, because the meaning is remembered by the word
 atev shabd kii pratham upasthiti hone ke kaaran shabd hi devtaa mana gaya he
 For example, in the words "indraya Swaha, Takkshakaya Swaha", these fourth terms Indraya and Takshkaya are deities
 arth ko devtaa sweekaar karne vaale vyakti bhi shabd kii upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, due to the predominance of the word in all the three sides, the Mimansakas have accepted the word as the deity
 yahan par ek niyam he - vidhi vaakya main jo devatavachak shabd he uskaa aavahan, tyaag or sookt vaakya aadi main uccharan karnaa chahie, na ki uske paryaayavachi shabdon ko
 For example, the word "jatvedas", synonymous with fire, should not be used in "agnayamashtakapalam"
 ukt baton se vidit hota he ki "shabdamayi devtaa" hi mimasaa darshan kaa siddhant he
 The idea of vigrahadi Sadasad bhava of the deity - Vigrahadi five of the deity etc
 are considered in this philosophy
 arthath vigrah, havish, bhoga, aishwarya, prasannataa or faldaatrutiv ye paanch vigrah kahe jate hai
 On the basis of the above promise, Vedantis have considered Vigrahadi five forms of the deity
 abhipraay yah he ki manushya aadi ke samaan hi kar, charan aadi avyav devataaon ke bhi hote hai, ve havish sweekaar karte hai, bhakshan karte hai or prasann hokar yajmaan ko fal dete hai
 Hence the deity is vigrahadimana
 uparyukt vichaar hi yask maharishi ne "nirukt" ke "athaakaar chintanam" vaakya se purushvigrahata ko siddh kiya he
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, "shabdmayi Deity" has been endorsed, but Shabar Swamy has denied the Deity Deity in his best deity authority
 praaia: parthasarathi, khandadev aadi sabhi vidwaanon ne isi maarg kaa avlamban kiya he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne apni tikaa main devtaa ko pradhan na maanakar dravya ke samaan use ang mana he or karm ko hi pradhanthya sweekaar kiya he tathaa kaha he ki karm hi fal detaa he
 No one pleads with the slave while the master is
 karmana phaljanakatvan tathaa shabdamayi devtaa, ukt dway siddhanton kaa samarthan devtaa vigrahadi ko maanakar anya mimasakon ne kiya he
 The deity of the commentary Shabar should be addressed with despotism
 atev purvamimasaa "shabdamayi devtaa" ko hi swikar karata he
 His knowledge, Tadhit, Chaturthi Vibhakti and Mantravan are from these three
 keval inamen paraspar antar yah he ki taddhit shakti kii aavriti se devtaa k bodhan karata he
 Chaturthi explains the Vibhakti symptoms and Mantravarna installations
 mimasaadarshan ne apni karmparakata kii drushti se ukt prakaar se devtaa kaa karm kaa ang mana he
 In fact, the deity is untapped
 nirukt vedang he ar mimasashastra vedapang he
 Therefore, in the context of Vedic deity philosophy, it is necessary to consider the interpretation of the Nirukta as independent and the main deity philosophy
 vaakyon ke dwaara jo bodh hota he use vaakyarth bodh yaa shaabd bodh kehete hai
 The sentence is also a statement - subantachay: vaakyam, tingantayovakyam, suptingntchayo vaakyam
 There are three aspects in it, which should have a causative verb
 amarkosh ke anusaar - "tid
subant chayo vaakyan kriya vaa karkanvita"
 That is, the causative verb of subant and tingant sentences is ejaculatory
 purvamimasaa main kumaril bhatta, prabhakar or murari ke teen mat prasiddh hai, kintu antim main "tripad niti nayan" is naam se khyath granth bhi vidit hua he
 There are two famous departures in the minds of the nominees, Anointedism and Anuvitabhidhanism
 inamen pratham kumaril bhatta or dwitiya prabhakar kaa mat he
 In the Shabdha sense, the sentiment is mainly accepted by Bhatt
 prabhakar ne kaary ko mukhya sweekaar kiya he
 The meaning of the term 'abhidhyataya' means that the substance enlightened by the terms integrates the aspiration, ability and attachment and makes it literal through the signs
 nyaayamat main padon kii padaarth main shakti he or pad gyaan lakshan yaa bodh karte hai
 The positions lead to the presence of matter
 isi prakaar mimasaa main kaha gaya he, udaahranarth jyotishtoman swarg kaamo yajet"
 Here "yajet" has two passages - "yaj" metal and "ta" suffix
 pratyay aakhyaatansh ko lekar aarthi bhaavana kaa pratipaadan karata he
 That feeling has three aspirations - Sādhyākāक्षाa साधa Sādhanākā औरa and "ityākāyātakābakक्षाa"
 saadhyaakanksha hone par swarg kaa saadhyatven anvay hota he
 When there is sadhana, the cause of Dhatworth is unknown
 
 It is an ambivalence that occurs when there is a duty
 vaakyarthaadhikaran main kaha gaya he- The sentence is used in the world to understand the specific meaning
 padashravan se padaarthon kaa pruthak pruthak gyaan hota he
 This is for reading, but the substance that is not intended to the listener and the sentence for which the sentence is used is not the function of the listener, in such a place the meaning of sentence is unacceptable
 atev anupapatti ke nivaranarth lakshana maani gai he
 All philosophers have accepted epigraphy as the seed of symptoms
 padon ke do prakaar ke taatpary maane gaye hai, pratham taatpary tathaa dwitiya mahataatpary
 The first difference refers to the subject matter, and the great phrase implies the subject
 abhihitanvayavaad main vaakya se vaakyarth kaa bodh lakshanya hota he
 Kumaril Bhatt has rendered with the following verses - is vachan se bhatta padka abhihitanvayavaad kaa swaroop digdarshit hota he
 Some scholars state that "ananavitavastha" matter is designated by matter
 unki anvitavastha keval lakshith hoti he
 Thus "anubhitabhidhanism" belongs to Kumaril Bhatt, but what Bhatta's translation translates as Anubhibhidhanism, is not appropriate, because the above article is not discussed anywhere in his texts
 anvitabhidhan shabd kaa yah arth he - pad anvitarth bodhan karte hai
 Therefore, by the power of verse, both the substance and the sentence are realized
 pad shakti se atirikt lakshana aadi maanane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The veteran uses the word to carry an object
 uske paas kaa balak us shabd ko shravan kar ou duusare purush ke le aane or le jane kaa kaary karte dekhakar shabd kaa arth samaj letaa he
 This is the working reason of the trend
 lok main kriya ko bhi kaary samajha jaataa he, usee prakaar veda main bhi yagadi kriya ko prathmat: kaary samajha jaataa he
 Yagadi activity is transient and heaven is eternal in future
 atev ukt veda vaakya vimarsh se yagatirikt "apurv, naamak vastu samajhi jaati he
 Here, the aforesaid two powers of "one work word" have to be accepted in two meanings
 ek main shakti or duusare se lakshana manani hoti he
 It also has special power in supernatural work, as is prevalent among scholars - lok main kriya rup kaary main lakshana hoti he
 In the Vedas, verses are sentences, and substance is a sentence
 is mat main vaakyarth, anvay or sansarg ye sab paryaay hai
 That is, the unknown is the instrument in the unknown
 prabhakar ne graahak grahan ko mana he, usase bhi anvitabhidhanwaad siddh hota he
 In this opinion - "yajet Swargakam:" This sentence gives the literal meaning of Anavitabhidhan
 is darshan main swargaprapti ke liye yag kaa hi vidhaan he
 The meaning of heaven is this - one who does not suffer from sorrow and there is no possibility of causing sorrow and to fulfill the desire, it is called heaven
 "dashampoornamasabhyaan swargakaamo yajet" ityadi vaakyon dwaara darshapurnmaas yag se swarg ke saadhan kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 Yag is considered ephemeral, as Yag is the name of the sacrifice of matter for the purpose of a deity
 "indray idan na mam" is vaakya se maanas vyapaar kaa tyaag hota he
 That business is destroyed in that moment
 niratishay priti vishay ko swarg kaha gaya he
 It is obtained in the period of time or birth
 yah darshan shaastra kaa niyam he, kayontpatti ke avyavhit purv kshan main kaaran ko rahanaa chahie or kshanik yag janmaantar bhavi swargotpatti ke avyavhit purvakshan main sambhav nahin he
 Thus, according to the above Shruti, the attainment of Yag, the means of heaven or the succession of Yag and the precession of the fruit, these are all proved to be an object, which is called extravagance, apurva, or merit
 iskaa vistrut vivechan kumaril bhatta ne apurvaadhikaran main yuktipurvak kiya he
 The man before Yaganushthan does not have the ability to consume heaven
 anushthan ke purv yag main bhi swargadi fal dene kii yogyata nahin hoti evam purush kii ayogyata tathaa karm kii ayogyata kaa niraakaran kar shastragamya samathrya ab vaa atishayyogyata ko apurv mana gaya he
 As ise adhikarapurv athwa falapurv kehete hai
 Where there is only one principal, the incomparable that arises from the principal Yag is called antecedent
 angon se jo apurv utpann hota he, use angaporesv kehete hai
 Both Angaapurava and Pradhanpuram together produce the Holiness
 usase swargadi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Some yagas bear fruit from many heads
 udaahranarth - darsh main teen yag hote hai or paurnmaas main bhi teen yag hote hai
 Here one community pre-arises from the three antecedents arising from the three princes
 donon samudayapurvon se ek parmapurv utpann hota he
 It is meant that in the first example above, three are considered unique
 dwitiya udhaaharan main utpatypurv, angaporesv, samudayapurv or falapurv, chaar apurv maane jate hai
 It is the servants of all the Muslims
 isamen bhatt mimasak shabar bhashya 2
 1
 2 ke "yagen apurv kruthva swarg bhavayet" anusaar shabd se tathaa shrutarthapatti se apurv kii siddhi karte hai
 And consider it to be the main feature in Lingadi's speech and vocabulary
 sabhi darshanikon ke dwaara apurv kaa jo khandan kiya gaya he vah vachyatvansh or praadhanyansh kaa hi khandan he
 Four categories have been considered for philosophy in philosophy - pramaan prameya pramiti pramaata
 Proof - Proof is that which has a definite knowledge of the subject and the determination of the subject
 prameya - pramaan ke dwaara jiskaa gyaan ho use prameya kehete hai
 Pramiti - Any subject that has definite knowledge through proof, is called pramiti
 pramaata - pramaan ke dwaara prameya gyaan ko jo jaanata he - use pramaata kehete hai
 Here various Indian philosophers have given a dual idea about knowledge - gyaan kaa pramanya swat: grahya he athwa parat: grahya he
 Mimansak, Vedanti and Buddhists come in the automatic category
 parat: koti main nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, jain or charvak aate hai
 Here, from the word 'authentic', one should understand the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, rather than the knowledge of the nature of knowledge
 chodanalakshanodharm: sutara main - "nanu atthabhootampyarth bruyat chodana" ityadi bhashya se arthtathatv hi vivakshit he
 "tchcha abadhitatvam, Arthanrutho dharma special :, tasya gyanen nirupranat"
 chaudnaa sutara ke bhashya "atathatv bhootan arth" se abaadhitiv arthnishth dharm vivakshit he, jiskaa nirupan gyaan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, pramanya is called jnanamanthi
 vah parat: utpann or parat: gruhit hota he
 This is the doctrine of barbarians
 arthath jis saamagree se gyaan utpann hota he, usase pramanya utpann na hokar anya saamagree se utpann hota he evam jisase gyaan grahit hota he, usase pramanya gruhit na hokar anya gun gyanadi se gruhit hota he
 From this it came to be that authenticity arises from material other than knowledgeable material and knowledge is authenticated by content other than customer content
 is mat main pramanya or apramanya donon parat: hote hai
 This is a routine consensus review
 uparyukt mat main mimasak log anavastha dosha bataate hai jisase gyaanamat pramanya kabhi siddh nahin ho saktaa
 That is, public behavior will be broken
 at: gyaanagat pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 The idea is that the content from which knowledge is produced, the same material also produces credibility; And the material with which knowledge is acquired, the same material is recognized
 yahi swat:pramanyawaadee mimaskadikon kaa pramanya kaa swatastv he, jiskaa kumaril bhatta ne apane granth bhatt vaarthik main anek yuktiyon se samarthan kiya he - Knowledge is permissible here in Bhattmat
 gyaan ke vishay main kuch atishay utpann hota he jisase "gyatoghat:" yah anubhav hota he
 From this, a religion called knownness arises in the subject of Ghatadi, which is called by the words Prakatyam, Bhasanam, Prakash
 isse yah aayaa ki gyatata lingak anumaan se gyaan kaa grahan hota he
 This is also the eclipse of authenticity
 prabhakar mat main gyaan swayan prakaash he
 Therefore, knowledge leads to enlightenment
 atev swat: pramanya donon maton main samaan he, jiskaa vivechan "shloke vaarthik", "prakaran panjika", "nyaay ratnamala" main vistrut rup se kiya gaya he
 The method of interpreting sentences of eternal meaning from direct inference is called method
 arthath agyatagyapak apravritapravartak jo vaakya hai uskaa naam "vidhi" he
 There are two sides of the mindset with respect to the pupil - one considers the propagation as the pupil
 isamen praayash: sabhi mimasak aa jate hai
 The second one considers the work to be complete
 yah prabhakar kaa siddhant he
 This side produces this type of - lok main pravartak purush, acharya athwa raja apane shishy athwa bhrity ko pravrutt karaane ke liye "gammanay" ityadi vaakya kaa prayog karte he
 a disciple or devotee, listening to the said sentence, researches its meaning
 pashchaat "gavaanayan" aadi kaary main pravrutt hota he
 Therefore, the motive of promoter man is special, it is called Vidhyarth in the world
 vah purush kii kriya he jo purush main rahati he
 Hence, it is also called Purushabhipraya
 veda apaurushey hone ke kaaran vaidic lingadi kaa arth purushabhipraay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hence, the word Lingadi is used in place of a man
 uskaa vyaparvishesh hi vidhyarth he
 Being literate, it is also called Shabdi Bhavna
 iskaa lakshan is prakaar kiya gaya he "purushapravrityanukool: pravartak lingadinishtho vyaparvishesh: shabdi bhaavana"
 In the scriptures, it has been called the introduction, inspiration, etc
 lok main pravriti do prakaar kii hoti he - pratham apni ichha se purush pravrutt hota he
 The second promoter is the person, or person, by word, which is called "inspiration
" jahaan prerana ke pashchaat pravriti hoti he, vahaan pravartan gyaan hi pravartak mana jaataa he, jise mandan mishra, parthasarathi prabhruti vidwaanon ne "ishtsaadhan" mana he
 Justice Sudhakar has considered it to be a special supernatural religion
 prabhakar mishra ne pravriti ke prati kaaryatagyaan ko kaaran mana he, jisase ishtsaadhanatv aadi akshipt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, "chodna Sympto Religion:" is written in the sutra - "acharya Chodit" Karomi "while explaining this commentary, Shaliknath has said - Chodit: Promoted:, Karyambhavadh: Itartha, Karyagayana without Pravrittarasamvadhitti" Therefore Prabhakar is said in the opinion
 Is - "karya vidyarthi:, tachya karya dhatvarthatiabharatam, Apoorva word vachyam tadeva vidyartha eti" veda vaakyarth nirnay ke liye pravrutt mimasaa darshan main chaar prakaar kii vidhi kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he - Origin: The sentence by which the nature of karma is primarily known, is called genesis method
 udaahranarth "agnihotran juhoti" is vaakya se agnihotra naamak home se isht ko praapt karnaa arth hota he
 Appropriation method: The method by which the relation of the organ is known is known as appropriation
 udaahranarth "dadhna juhoti" is vaakya se dahi se havan karne kaa arth bodhit hota he
 It has Dadhi means and Home is practicable
 yahan viniyog vidhi main viniyog shabd se sambandh ko samajhnaa chahie
 That relationship ends in the practicable means, the angangi or the remaining
 prayogvidhi : jo pradhan or ang ke anushthan main kram kaa bodh karaata he use prayogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, heaven is attained by the Yajna, the principal worshiper of the Prayasadi organ
 isi abhipraay se lakshan kiya gaya he "angaanaan krambodhako vidhi; prayogvidhi:" Adhikavidhi: The method by which the karta of the karmajni fruit is regarded as the doer is called the Adhikavidhi
 udaahranarth "yajet swarg kaam:" yahan jo yagakarta he vahi swargfal kaa bhokta he
 In the same way, three types of methods are famous with distinction between Apoorva law, Rule method and Parvakhya method - upar vidhiyon ke do prakaar bataae gaye hai, use is prakaar samajhnaa chahie ki apurvavidhi main utpatti, viniyog prayog or adhikaar vidhi chaaron antargat hote hai
 Rule and number law is within the appropriation method itself

 a paragraph is a specific part of an article or essay in which a particular and often a thought-related thought and information related to a topic is discussed
 yadi anuchhed kisi niabandh yaa anya vidha kaa hissaa ho to vah apane purvavarti or parvarti anuchhedon se sambhddha hota he
 He is also complete in himself to a extent
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne likhaa tha ki vichaaratmak niabandh main lekhak ko apane bhav yaa vichaar dabaa-dabaakar bharne chahie or ek anuchhed kaa sambandh duusare se hona chahie
 a series of ideas should remain
 usamen 'purvapar sambandh' rahanaa chahie
 For example, a paragraph on the topic "benefits of Study" is given below- anuchhed ke shabdic arth ke anusaar iskaa kisi rachana kaa ansh hona anivaary he, kintu aajkal swatantra roopen anuchhed lekhan kaa abhyaas bhi karaayaa jaataa he taaki lekhan-kaushal kii kshamta viksit ho sake
 An attempt to express your thoughts on some subject in a few, but selected words is called unscripted writing
 yah kisi lekh, niabandh yaa rachana kaa ansh bhi ho saktaa he kintu swayan main purna hona chahie
 In the words of Dr
 Kiran Nanda, a paragraph can be defined as- ukt paribhaasha ke aadhaar par spasht he ki anuchhed lekhan kaa koi bhi vishay ho saktaa he, vah shabd, vaakya, sutara rup main bhi ho saktaa he
 It should be freely flowing in style and expressed in prose language
 jab ham kisi vishay, vichaar yaa sheershak ko vistaarpurvak likhen ki ek anuchhed taiyaar ho jaae to ise 'anuchhed lekhan' kaha jaataa he
 There is a difference between 'article writing' and 'essay writing' and 'pallavan writing'
 inke parsparik antar ko samaj lenaa aavashyak he
 In both genres, the writer develops his own feelings and thoughts, yet there is enough difference between the two
 jate hai
 The author expresses his thoughts in the form of a paragraph on the given subject through his acquired knowledge, personal experience and strong language
 ek achche anuchhed ke liye nimna baton ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie- The concept that connects language and literature is called 'style'
 style ko sahetuk bhashaa-paddati kaha jaataa he
 Variations in the language according to the specific application of the language, the particular genre and the particular user are called styles of language
 anuchhed lekhan me praayah nimnlikhit shaileyon kaa prayog hota he- Apart from these, the author can use many types of genres such as descriptive, descriptive, reflective, general colloquial style
 apni ruchi or vishay ke anukool style ke prayog se anuchhed main sajivta aa jaati he
 Style should be used to fit the description, thought and sentiment, so that the article incorporates the qualities of adequate flow, elegance etc
 bhartiya samskruti kaa moolmantra 'maanav-jati se pyaar' oonch-neech kii bhaavana rupi hawa ke jhonke se yatra-tatra bikhar gaya
 This disease of high and low is a disease, which thrives in the society gradually and shakes the foundation of a good and cultured society
 parinamswaroop maanav-samaaj ke samul nasht hone kii ashanka rahati he
 Hence untouchability is a terrible stigma for human society
 aaj sansar ke prayek kshetra main chaahe vah raajnneetik ho athwa aarthik, dharmik ho yaa saamaajik, sarvatra asprishyata ke darshan kiye ja sakate hai
 Although America, England, Japan etc
 are developed and thriving countries from scientific point of view, they are also suffering from untouchability
 america jaise mahaan raashtra main kaale evam goren logon kaa bhedbhaav aaj bhi bana hua he
 According to sociologists, 'the mother of untouchability is the spirit of high and low'
 asprishyata ke teen kaaran he: The first reason for untouchability is the development of racial feeling
 kuch prajatiyaan apane ko duusare prajatiyon se shreshth maanati hai
 American whites consider the Negro people as hay, in addition, the winning species considers the defeated castes to be inferior
 dharm main pavitrataa evam shudhdi kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he, atah nimna vyavsaay waalon ko hin drushti se dekha jaataa he
 In Indian society, for these reasons, those who did the cleaning work and the workers etc
 were considered untouchable
 prajateey evam dharmik kaarnon ke atirikt asprishyata ke saamaajik kaaran bhi hai
 Due to prevailing trends and practices in the society, class differences also arise in the society
 yah vargabhed asprishyata ke vikaas main sahaayak sidhd hote hai
 With the change of time, the thoughts of human beings also changed
 jaise-jaise vigyaan kii pragati hoti gai, samaaj aarthik rup se viksit hota gaya
 Money became dominant in society
 aaj maanav kii saamaajik sthiti paise se aanki jaati he
 Today he is the best, who is rich
 atah saamaajik sthiti janmajaat na hokar arjeet ho gai
 With the change in social status, the terrible tree of untouchability has started to waver
 shiksha kaa uddeshy he-samaaj main prachlit rudhiyon, dharmandhta, sankeernata kii bhaavana ko dur karnaa, jisase asprishyata swayan hi dur hogi
 When there is a change in the attitude of human beings, there will be a development of a sense of cosmopolitanism, then the difference between the upper and lower classes will be eliminated

 Watches are made with many principles
 jaise dhoop ghadi, yantric ghadi, electronic ghadi aadi Most clocks have a spontaneous system of regularly producing repetitive actions, such as oscillator oscillation, oscillation of spiral cords and equilibrium cycles, oscillation of pressure channels, or comparison of high frequency signals to the atomic structure of atoms
 pracheen kaal main dhoop ke kaaran padanevaali kisi vriksh athwa anya sthir vastu kii chaaya ke dwaara samay ke anumaan kiya jaataa tha
 Such incense has been practiced since ancient times, in which "clock" or "stroke" was estimated by the change in the speed of reflection of a steady piece of stone or iron due to the sun's movement in the sky

 In 1300, Henry de Vick created the first clock with a wheel, numeral and hour director needle, in which the needles and oscillators of minutes and seconds were attached by 1700 AD
 aajkal kii yantric ghadiyaan isi shrunkhlaa kii sanshodhit, sanvardhit evam viksit kadiyaan hai
 The repetitive action of the mechanical clock depends on the oscillation of a oscillator, or the balance wheel and the balancing spring, or balancing
 in yantron kii aavart gati atyant niyamit kram se hoti he
 Many serrated wheels are associated with them
 dolan pranali kaa ek dolan puraa hone par in pahiyon ke ek yaa ek se adhik daante dhoomate hai
 Thus these wheels calculate oscillations
 in pahiyon se ghadi kii suiyaan judi hoti hai, jo dial par gumti hai or dial par ankit samayvibhag kii sahaayta se samay batalaati hai
 The number page is divided into hours, minutes and seconds
 dolak evam ganakyantr pranaaliyon ko nirantar chalaate rahane ke liye vaanchit urja kamaani yaa bhaar dwaara praapt hoti he
 In general, the oscillator system receives energy from the calculator system through a special mechanical system, which is called the drainage system
 yah dhaatu kaa ek gol tukdaa hota he, jo dhaatu kii ek chad dwaara latakaaya hua rahata he
 When the oscillator's expansion or amplitude is not very high, the oscillator's oscillation time is usually the same
 yah dekha gaya he ki 39
14 inch lambaaiwale dolak kii chad main 0
001 inch kaa parivartan kar dene par ghadi ke samay main 1 second prati din kaa antar pad jaataa he
 Similarly, if the oscillation expansion is increased by more than 3 inches, then there is a difference of 1 second in clock time by every 0
1 inch increase
 isse spasht he ki taap main parivartan se dolak kii lambaai main honevaale parivartanon ke kaaran ghadi ke samay main aksar truti aa jaati he
 To overcome this defect, the rod is made of steel-alloy or "invar", which changes only one-tenth of that of ordinary steel due to the effect of cold heat
 harrison kaa gridispaat dolak es hi dolak k vyaavhaarik rup he
 It is a system in which momentary oscillating impulses are provided to the oscillator by a rotating wheel or wheel and, at the same time, the speed of that cycle remains constant throughout the period of oscillation of the oscillator
 is prakaar yah vyavastha dolan kii gananaa karne, dolan ko niyamit rakhane tathaa dolan aayam ko niyantrit karne kaa kaary karti he
 The best escape mechanism is one in which a small load falls on the oscillator at regular intervals, giving it a uniform impulse the moment the oscillator is passing through its mean state
 yah vyavastha kai prakaar se sampann kii ja sakati he, jinamein nimnlikhit mukhya he : It has an anchor a which oscillates around the center A
 k se ek dolak neeche kii ore lataka hota he
 After the oscillation of the oscillator, a tooth in the wheel crosses one of the pallets on both ends of the anchor
 is prakaar vah us pallate ko ek halakaa sa dhakka detaa he jisase vah pallate upar uth jaataa he or doosraa pallate apane neeche vaale pahie par girakar use peeche kii ore halkaa sa jhatka detaa he
 But the curvature of this palette is such that in response to this shock, the tooth picks up this palette and crosses below it
 is prakaar yah pahiyaa nirantar chalata rahata he or lungar kaa dolan karaata rahata he
 In this circulatory cycle, the tip of the teeth are placed in the opposite direction of the tip of the teeth of the aforesaid rebound exodus
 uparyukt donon palaayanatantr praarambhik koti ke hai
 Many new types of escapes have been created by progressively improving them
 aajkal prayukt honevaale palaayanatantron main aisi vyavastha hoti he ki palayanchakr, arthath uparyukt daantedaar pahiyaa, jyon hi apana aaveg dolak ko pradaan kar chuktaa he, uskaa sambandh dolak se bhang ho jaataa he
 The transient relationship is established again when the oscillation returns to its midpoint of oscillation again
 aise palaayan tantra ko viyukt palaayanatantr kehete hai
 The chronometer, or chronometer, employed in modern watches is such a separate escape cycle
 vastut: isi par ghadi kii parishuddhta or yatharthata nirbhar karti he
 There are many wheels in the watch, which are driven by a declining load or the energy provided by the segmental
 patansheel bhaar dwaara chalanevaali ghadiyaan aaj se saikadon varsh purv banaai gai thim
 These consisted of a weight hanging from the ends of a long thread wrapped around a large drum, which itself moved down and rolled the drum
 dhol ek chote pahie se judaa rahata tha
 This wheel spun itself and spun a large wheel with the help of its teeth
 bade pahie ke saath ek chota pahiyaa ghumta tha, jo ek anya bade pahie ko ghumata tha
 This big wheel was related to a drainage mechanism, which controlled the speed of the fall of the load
 palaayan chakra ko ek dolak kii sahaayta se niyamit gati se ghumaya jaataa tha
 One tooth of the migration cycle moved with oscillation from right to left of oscillator
 in pahiyon main se ek ke saath ghante kii, duusare ke saath minute kii or tisare ke saath second kii sooyee judi rahati thi
 These needles used to rotate on a number page
 chote pahie ke chha: dante the or yah minute k sooyee se sambandhit tha
 There were 72 teeth in the big wheel
 isse ghante kii sooyee sambanddh thi
 Thus, when the small wheel completed 12 rounds, the big wheel rotated one round
 aadhunik ghadiyon main bhaar or dhol ke sthaan par faaulad kii ek choti si kamaani lagaai jaati he
 The spring is tightened
 pahiyon ke ghoomane ke liye aavashyak urja is kamaani ke dhire dhire khulne kii kriya se praapt hoti he
 Small watches have a balancing wheel in place of the oscillator, which rotates from right to left
 is ghurnan ko niyantrit karne ke liye ek keshakamani lagi hoti he
 When the balance wheel rotates in one direction, there is a spasm in the capillary, which brings it back to the opposite direction and causes rotation
 ghadi ko nirantar gatisheel rakhane ke liye faaulad kii kamaani ko niyat avadhi ke baad pun: kasakar lapet diya jaataa he, jiske liye ek chaabi hoti he
 Clock clocks and whip clocks, or timepieces, that produce bells ringing at certain times, have a separate system for generating bells
 aisi ghadi ke bheetar ek ghanti lagi hoti he, jisapar ek hathode kii chot padane par dhwani utpann hoti he
 This hammer is attached to a load or segmental, which drives it over a fixed period

 See detailed article on electronic clock
 vidyut ghadiyon ke parishkrut evam utkrisht rup daab-vidyut-manibhon ke kampan dwaara chalanevaali ghadiyaan hai
 In these, the crystalline crystal is oscillated by alternating current and the clock runs through these oscillations

 Three measures have been considered so far to obtain the desired oscillation frequency in atomic clocks: parmaanu sijium kii mul avasthaa kii ati sookshm sanrachana dwaara
 This structure derives from the denaturation of spectral lines due to the magnetic rotations of the nucleus

 The frequency of the crystal crystals is controlled by the above frequencies
 sphatik manibh kaa dolan kuch kilo-cycle maatr hota he
 It is amplified into very high frequency signals by an amplifier chain
 yah aavriti praaia: usee koti kii hoti he jis koti kii niyantrak aavriti hoti he
 If the oscillation frequency of the crystalline crystal is much lower than the controller frequency, it has a self-propagating mechanism called clocks to reach the control frequency

 In 1949, the incident of the Chinese Communist Party seizing power in China is called the Chinese Communist Revolution
 china main 1946 se 1949 tak grihayuddh kii sthiti thi
 The second phase of this civil war came in the form of communist revolution
 china ne aadhikarik taur par is avadhi ko 'mukti sangram' kaha jaataa he
 By the middle of the 19th century, China had remained an ignorant, demolished, battered Asian country almost unaware of its glorious history
 bhale hi vah aupchaarik rup se kisi videshi takat kaa upnivesh nahin tha parantu uski haalat kisi duusare gulam desh se behatar nahi thi
 Historians called the struggle of European powers in China as "weed of melons", a fruit which the people of their choice cut and split among themselves, eat and digest

 Britain had promoted the consumption of opium in China to protect its selfishness, and had greatly oppressed the drunk Chinese
 atah yah swaabhaavik tha ki rashtrapermi chinia ke man main in utpeedak paristhitiyon ke prati aakrosh punap rahaa tha
 The nature of China's first revolution was primarily cultural and was initiated by Dr
 Sanyat Sen
 unheen ke prayatnon se rashtravaadi chini party kii sthapana hui jise 'kuomitang' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The Manchu dynasty that ended the republic was founded in 1911 and its provisional president was Yuvan Shih Kai
 kintu usne pratikriyaavaadi evam damanaatmak kadam uthaate hue kuomitanga dal par pratibandh laga diya or sanyaat sen ko japan bhaagna padaa
 Yuwan Shih Kai also died in 1916 and after his death the provincial governor and generals declared themselves independent, the whole of China was divided under the control of many war chiefs
 1917 i
 main kuomitanga dal ne araajaktaa ke maahaul main ganatantric sarkaar kii sthapana kaa prayaas kiya
 At the same time, influenced by the communist revolution in Russia, in 1923, Sanayat Sen tried to form a democratic government by entering into a cooperative treaty with the Russian communist government, but it was not completed due to his death in 1925
 aage unke uttaradhikari chyang kaai shaike ko china ke samyavaadee dal ke saath grih yuddh main funsana padaa
 Finally, on 1 October 1949, the Communist Party under the leadership of Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China
 1917 main hui rus kii bolshevik kranti ke prabhaav se chini bhi achoota na rahaa
 In 1919 Peking teachers and students established an institution for the study of communism, Marxism
 inhen vyaktiyon main maotse tung bhi shaamil tha jo aage chalakar chini samyavaadee dal kaa netaa bana
 The Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1919 with the efforts of these people

 This communist ideology also influenced the liberal nationalists of China, including Sanayat Sen
 vastutah dow sanyaat sen china ko sangathit karne ke liye videshi sahaayta praapt karnaa chahta tha lekin pashchim ke samrajyavaadee rajyon ne unki koi madad nahin kii antat vah soviet sangh kii ore aakrisht hua
 Russia expressed sympathy for China in the greed for communist proliferation and assured it of all assistance
 isi sandarbh main 1921 i
 main comintern ke pratinidhi mering ne sanyaat sen se mulaakaat kar aapasi sahyog kii charchaa kii
 Dr
 Sanayat Sen's understanding and organizational ability led to a cooperative relationship between the Kuomitang and the Chinese Communist Party
 roosi samyavaadee vichaarkon ne chini communist party ko kuomitanga dal ke saath miljul kar kaary karne ko kaha
 Together, they started working against imperialism
 sanyaat sen ke jivit rahane tak yah sahyog bana rahaa or donon dal miljul kar kaary karte rahe
 But on 12 March 1925, Sanayat Sen died
 tatpashchaat chini samyavaadee dal tathaa kuomitanga ke bich matbhed utpann hone lage
 In fact, the Chinese communists were trying to strengthen their organization
 unhone kisaanon or mazdooron ko apane paksh main sangathit kiya or rashtriya str par ek majdoor sangh kii sthapana kii
 As a result, the frequency of strikes and demands of workers increased
 isi tarah kisaanon ke sangh bane jinhone lagaan main kami tathaa jameendaari unmoolan kii maang kii
 After the death of Sanayat Sen in 1925, Maotse Tung launched a fierce peasant movement in Hunan Province
 is andolan ne na sirf jameendaaron ko ukhaad phenkaa balki sampatti par kabja kar samaaj ke dhaanche ko badla
 After the death of Sunayat Sen, Chuang Kai-shek became the chief of the Kuomitang Dal
 uski sadbhaavna vyavsaasiyon va jameendaaron ke saath thi
 He expelled the Communists from the Kuomitang Dal
 chyang kaa maananaa tha ki communist shaktishaalee hote ja rahe hai jo jameendaaron par akraman kar unki sampatti par kabja kar rahe hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate them
 chyang kaai shaike ne communiston ko party se nikaal kar shuddhikaran andolan chalaaya jisamen hajaaron communist, trade unionist tathaa kisaan netaa maare gaye
 In this way Chiang Kai-shek firmly established his power in Nanking
 1943 i
 main maotse tung chini communist party kii kendriya samiti kaa adhyaksh hua or sheershasth netaa ban gaya
 The Communist Party under Mao's leadership expanded its power and made it the center of power in the "qiangsi" province
 dhire-dhire frukien, hunaan aadi praanton main bhi apni satta sarkarein sthapit kii
 Meo made a massive change in the Communist Party's strategy, emphasizing that the Communist Party should try to gain public support among the peasants compared to the industrial laborers
 kaaran yah tha ki china multah ek krishi pradhan desh tha jahaan audyogic kranti abhi pichhadi hui thi
 The Communist Mao government of Qiangsi province did not accept the power of the Kuomitang government of Nanking
 chyang kaai check ke adheen nanking kii sarkaar apni sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye kiyangsi kii communist sarkaar ke viruddh 1934 i
 main bhayankar abhiyaan kiya
 It is known as the "abolition Campaign"
 lakhon kii sankhya main communiston ko maut ke ghat utaara gaya
 In order to avoid this oppression and tyranny, the communists "mahaprasthan" towards the province of Shenxi in the north which started from October 16, 1934 and completed in October 20, 1935
 is 6000 mile lambi duuri ko anek nadiyon, pahaado, jangalon ko paar karte hue shensi praant ke yenon nagar main pahunch kar use rajdhani banaakar vahaan apni sarkaar sthapit kii
 It is worth noting here that in 1921 AD, Japan invaded China
 chyang kaai shaike ne is samay japani khatre se bada khatra samyawad ko samajha or apni sampoorn shakti samyavaadiyon ke daman main laga di
 The Communists established their government in the province of Shenxi, which was near the North China occupied by Japan, and the Communists spoke out against the Japanese invasion and dominance
 maao ne kaha ki kuomitanga or samyavaadiyon donon ko milakar desh main ek sarkaar kii sthapana kerani chahie or milakar japani akraman kaa muqabla kar, unhen desh main ek sarkaar kii sthapana kerani chahie or milakar japani akraman kaa muqabla kar, unhen desh se baahar kar dena chahie
 Due to this view of the communists, the majority of the Chinese people joined them and as a result, the communists got a chance to increase their power
 chyang kaai shaike japaniyon ko rokane ke bajaay communiston kaa safaya karnaa adhik mahatvapurn maanata tha or isliye 1936 main samyavaadiyon se sangharsh karne ke liye liyang ke netritv main ek sena shensi praant bheji kintu samyavaadiyon ne apane chini bhaiyon se ladanaa uchit nahin samajha or liyang ke adheen bheji gai sena ko rashtriya chetana se yukt kar japaniyon se sangharsh karne ko kaha
 When Chiang Kai-shek spoke of the suppression of the Communists, Liang held him captive, but eventually he was freed by the Communists' intervention
 atah chini lokmat kii ichha ko dekhte hue chyang ne samvaadiyon ke saath baatcheet aarambh kii or 1937 main ek samjhauta kiya taaki sammilit prayaas karte hue japan ke prabhutv ko nasht kiya ja sake
 According to the agreement, the Communists' rule over the Shenxi and Kangsu provinces of northwestern China was accepted and the communist army was considered part of China's national army, which was to follow the orders of General Secretary Chiang Kai-shek against Japan
 is prakaar china main do pruthak-pruthak sarkaar is samay vidyaman thi
 Both had their own separate armies and both were ready to develop governance and social order according to their ideals in their respective regions
 yah samjhauta samyavaadiyon kii shakti ko badhaane main atyant mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In 1937, Japan invaded and defeated China and captured China
 nanking par japan kaa adhikaar ho jane se chyang kaai shaike ko peeche hatana padaa or pashchim main chungking ko apni rajdhani bananaa padaa
 On the other hand, the staunch Communists in the Shenxi province led an effective guerrilla fight against Japan in the north and presented themselves as patriotic nationalists to the people
 is kaaran japani atyaachaar se peedit kisaanon or madhyavarg kaa baari samarthan mila
 Meanwhile the Second World War started and the sino-japanese War became part of the Second World War
 us samay bhi chyang kaai shaike samyavaadiyon ko badhati shakti se chintit tha, japani akraman se nahin
 He gave more importance to China's internal politics than to the struggle against Japan
 atah samyavaadiyon tathaa kuomitanga ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti punah utpann ho gai
 With the onset of World War II, the sino-japanese War was influenced by american-british policies
 america or britain ne chyang kaai shaike ke sarkaar kii madad hetu vayuyan dwaara lakhon ton yuddh saamagree pahunchaai taaki japan yaa rus kaa prabhaav china main na bade
 In fact, a major reason for America's and Britain's interference in China's internal affairs was their opposition to communist ideology

 The Allies, including the US, wanted the Chiang Kai-shek government of China to continue the war with Japan and not compromise with it
 saath hi vah samyavaadee sarkaar ke saath milakar japaniyon kaa muqabla kare
 Operationalized with this aim, the US, through General Steelwell and US Ambassador Hurley, tried to reach a compromise between Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists and confront the Japanese together, but the US failed and the agreement between the two Could not happen 1945 i
 main japan ne aatmasamarpan kar diya or dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa ant ho gaya, kintu china kii samasya kaa ant nahin hua
 In fact, Japan had control in Nanking and after the end of the war, the problem arose whether the Kuomitang government of Chungqing occupied the occupied countries of the Nanking government or the Kuomitang government of Chungqing over the occupied territories of the communist government of Yenan province or Yenan
 Both parties of the communist government of the province proceeded to control Nanking
 atah china main punah grihayuddh kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 The US sent General Marshall in 1945 to negotiate a settlement between the two parties and to establish democracy to avert civil war
 marshall ke prayaason se 10 janvari 1946 ko yah samjhauta sampann hua
 According to the agreement, the party whose army has the right will be in the right of the same army, but this agreement was not permanent and civil war started on the rights of all the states
 samyavaadee sena ne uttari evam purvi china ke anek pradeshon par apana adhikaar sthapit kiya
 By January 1949, the Communists took control of Tintasin and Peking, and later Nanking, Shanghai Hanko and Canton, and on October 1, 1949, the Communists declared a "people's State" in Peking, and many countries including the Soviet Union Gave recognition to the communist government

 In fact, the US could not openly support Chiang even though the US wanted in the conflict between the Communists and Chiang Kai-shek, because then Russia would have come in support of the Communists
 is dasha main america-rus ke bich pratyaksh sangharsh kii sambhaavna banati
 As a result, the United States often supported the policy of neutrality, and this made Chiang Kai-shek's political situation extremely weak

 kuomitanga dal kii alokapriyata evam bhrasht shashan : chyang kaai shaike ke netritv main kuomitanga sarkaar bhrasht or nikammi thi
 He had nothing to offer to the public as an improvement
 unhone aise kisi kaarykram kii ghoshnaa nahin kii jisase vyapak jansamarthan hasil kiya ja sake
 Not only this, the Kuomitang government wasted most of its time protecting the interests of industrialists, bankers and landlords
 shashan main bhrashtachar vyaapt tha, janata ke upyog hetu laai gai saamagree nijee vyapaarik sadhano main prayukt ho rahi thi, aisi sthiti main sarkaar ne jansamarthan kho diya

 Weaknesses of Military Organization and Military Strategy: The military weakness of the Kuomitang Dal was that there was a feeling of opposition to it that its top government employee was very corrupt and incompetent
 sainikon ko samay par vetan nahin miltaa tha
 The recruitment and promotion of soldiers was based on devotion rather than merit
 grihayuddh ke dauraan chyang ke sarkaar kii sainya kamajori evam ayogyata spasht ho gai vastutah chyang kii sena ne yuddh kaa sanchaalan bade-bade shaharon ko kendra bana kar kiya, parantu ye shahar samyavaadiyon dwaara chaaron ore se gher liye gaye
 In contrast, the communist army was efficient and efficient

 As a result, they succeeded against the nationalists

 The condition of the farmers suffering from drought and famine was poor, on the other hand, there was no shortage of food grains by the profiteers and merchants in the cities
 america prabhutv china main atyadhik tha or videshi poonjipati china kaa jamkar shoshan kar rahe the
 The Kuomitang government was unable to stop this exploitation
 faltah saamaanya janata sahit poonjipati varg ke log bhi sarkaar ke virdohi ho gaye
 In fact, the Kuomitang government did not offer any concrete socio-economic program to gain public support whereas the communists gained public support by presenting such a program

 rashtravaadi sarkaar kaa samrajyavaadee shaktiyon ke saath sambandh : china kii rashtravaadi kuomitanga sarkaar kaa america jaise samrajyavaadee deshon ke saath sambandh tha
 The Chinese economy was operating from American economic imperialist policy
 china kii baking vyavastha par america bank kaa niyantran tha
 There was an excessive amount of American goods coming into China
 1848 tak yah maatra itani adhik ho gai thi ki china kii adhikansh audyogic ikaiyaan band ho gai or tamaam majdoor bekaar ho gaye
 This is the reason why the peasant-laborers etc
, dissatisfied with the policy of the government, supported the Chinese Communists in the civil war
 faltah samyavaadiyon ko safalataa mili

 Chiang Kai-shek's short-sightedness: Chiang Kai-shek introduced short-sightedness in the Japanese invasion and relations with the Communists
 usne japani akraman ke khatre se kahin zyada bada khatra samyavaadiyon ko mana or samyavaadiyon ke daman kaa prayaas kiya
 While the Communists countered the Japanese invasion against China's interests and fought back in their territories, the Communists gained public support in this situation and the Communists succeeded in defeating Chiang Kai-shek in the Civil War

 Galileo Galilei was a scientist from Italy
 ve ek mahaan avishkaarak the tathaa doordarshee ke vikaas main unka athulaneey sahyog tha
 This great thinker was born into a musician family in the city of Pisa, modern Italy
 aadhunik italy kaa shahar pisa 15 farvari 1564 ke mahaan vaigyanik galileo gallily ke janm ko bhi ishwar kii rachana kaa dosha maanakar aitihaasik bhul kar baitha tha
 The doctrines propounded by Galileo contradicted religious beliefs, for which Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment for trespassing with divine beliefs
 inke pita vincounjo gallily us samay ke jane maane sangeet visheshgy the
 He used to play an instrument called "lute", the same instrument called lute which later evolved into guitar and banjo
 apni sangeet rachana ke dauraan vincounjo gallily ne tani huyi dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaale swaron kaa gahanta se adhyayan kiya tathaa yah paaya ki dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaali aawaaj main sambandh he
 The scientific study of the results of the interrelations of the sounds of the string, or the string, stretched for the music by the father, was done by his son Galileo
 is adhyayan ko karne ke dauraan balak galileo ke man main sugrahita purna prayog karte huye unke parinamo ko aatmsaat karne kii prerana pradaan kii
 He is considered the father of exam oriented science
 inhone dolan kaa sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He invented binoculars
 usne doordarshee yantra ko adhik unnat banaaya
 With his help, he took many astronomical observations and supported the theory of Copernicus
 unhen aadhunik praayogic khagoliki kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He found that the laws of nature are influenced by each other's factors and there is a relation between the increase and decrease of one as in the equations of mathematics
 isaliye unhone kaha kih-‘ ishwar kii bhashaa ganit he
 'this great mathematician and scientist only dared to measure the speed of light
 iske liye galileo or unka ek sahaayak andheri raat main kai mile dur sthit do pahaad kii chotiyon par ja baithe
 From where Galileo lit the lantern, after getting his assistant's signal, they were to indicate the light through the lantern and its knock
 duusari pahari par sthit unke sahaayak ko laalaten kaa prakaash dekhakar apane paas rakhi duusari laalaten kaa khatka hataakar punah sanket karnaa tha
 Thus Galileo had to estimate the speed of light by looking at the light shining on the top of the second mountain
 is prakaar galileo ne jo parinaam paaya vah bahut seemaa tak vaastavik to na tha parantu prayogon kii aavruti or safalataa asafalataa ke baad hi abhisht parinaam paane kii jo muhim unke dwaara prarambh kii gayi vah adwitiya thi
 In due course, Albert Einstein, the great scientist who solved the intricate relationship between the speed of light and the relationship of energy, referred to him as 'father of modern science'
 galileo dharmik pravruth ke the parantu puraani dharmik manyataon ko vivekshiltaa or prayog ke madhyam se sidv karnaa chaahate the
 In the year 1609, Galileo discovered a telescope that was invented in Holland, with the help of this telescope, one could study their motion by looking at distant celestial bodies
 galileo ne iskaa vivaran sunakar swayan aisi doorabeen kaa nirmaan kar daalaa jo holland main avishkrut doorabeen se kahin adhik shaktishaalee thi
 Based on this, through his observations and experiments, Galileo found that all the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, contrary to the prevailing beliefs in the universe
 isse purv copernicus ne bhi yah kaha tha ki prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he jiske liye unhe carch kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa tha
 Now, based on the results based on experimentation and discretion, Galilea found it to be the same
 us samay tak yah sarvamaanya sidwant tha ki brahmand ke kendra main prithvi sthit he tathaa surya or chandramaa sahit sabhi akashiya pind lagaataar prithvi kii parikrama karte he
 This recognition was supported by the religious leaders of Tadsamay
 apane prayogon ke aadhaar par praapt parinaamon ke kaaran galileo ne puraani avadharanaon ke virudv khadey hone kaa nirnay liya
 When Galileo made this doctrine public, the Church considered it his disobedience and for this disobedience Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment on behalf of the Church
 galileo ke dwaara diye gayi vichaar ne tadsamay manushya ke chintan kii disha ke naye rup main swikaarne ko vivash kar diya
 Due to social and religious persecution, he could not stand for long with the theories, contrary to the prevailing beliefs and beliefs
 varsh 1633 main 69 varshiya vrudv galileo ko carch kii ore se yah aadesh diya gaya ki ve saarvajanik taur par maafee maangate huye yah kahen ki dharmik manyataon ke virudv diye gayi unke sidwant unke jivan kii sabase bady bhul thi jiske liye ve sharminda hai
 He did the same, but even after this he was imprisoned
 unka swasthya lagaataar bigadta rahaa or isi ke chalate karawas kii sajaa grih-kaid arthath apane hi ghar main kaid main rahane kii sajaa main badal diya gaya
 He also spent the last day of his life in this prison

 Thus, it took more than three and a half years for the Church to accept its historical error by ordering a 1633 order regarding Galileo, a great astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher
