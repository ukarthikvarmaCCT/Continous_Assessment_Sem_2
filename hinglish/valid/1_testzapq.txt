 Bharatendu Harishchandra is known as the father of modern Hindi literature
 ve hindi main aadhuniktaa ke pehle rachanaakaar the
 His original name was 'harishchandra', 'bharatendu' was his title
 unka kaarykaal yug kii sandhi par khadaa he
 He adopted the land of healthy tradition and sowed the seeds of innovation, leaving the nutritious practices of the perverted feudal culture of Reetikal
 hindi sahitya main aadhunik kaal kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandr se mana jaataa he
 Bharatenduji, famous as the forerunner of the Indian renaissance, made the aim of his literature depicting the poverty, subjugation, inhuman exploitation of rulers of the country
 hindi ko raashtra-bhashaa ke rup main pratishthit karne kii disha main unhone apni pratibha kaa upyog kiya
 Bharatendu was rich in versatility
 hindi patrakarita, naatak or kavy ke kshetra main unka bahumoolya yogadan rahaa
 The beginning of plays in Hindi is believed to be from Bharatendu Harishchandra
 bharatendu ke naatak likhane kii shuruyaat bangala ke vidyasundar naatak ke anuwaad se hoti he
 Although plays were written even before them, Bhartendu strengthened the foundation of Hindi drama by regularly writing several plays in Khadiboli
 unhone 'harishchandra chandrika', 'kavivachansudha' or 'bala bodhini' patrikaon kaa sampadan bhi kiya
 He was an outstanding poet, strong satirist, successful playwright, conscious journalist and vigorous prose
 iske alaava ve lekhak, kavi, sampadak, nibandhkaar, evam kushal vaktaa bhi the
 Bharatendu ji wrote a huge literature at a young age of only thirty-four years
 unhone maatra or gunvattta kii drushti se itnaa likhaa or itani dishaao main kaam kiya ki unka samoochaa rachanakarm pathdarshak ban gaya
 Bharatendu Harishchandra was born on September 9, 1850 in a prestigious Vaishya family of Kashi
 unke pita gopalchandra ek achche kavi the or 'giradhardaas'upnaam se kavita likhaa karte the
 At the time of the first Indian freedom struggle in 1857, he would be 7 years old
 ye din unki aankh khulne ke the
 Bharatendu's work is evidence that once his eyes were opened, he did not stop
 unke purvaj angrej bhakt the, unki hi krupa se dhanwaan huye the
 Harishchandra was five years old, his mother died and ten years old, his father died
 is prakaar bachapan main hi mata-pita ke sukh se vanchit ho gayi
 Vimata tortured a lot
 bachapan kaa sukh nahin mila
 The system of education continued for the first time
 samvedansheel vyakti ke naate unamem swatantra rup se dekhne-sochane-samajhane kii aadat kaa vikaas hone laga
 His mind kept getting troubled by the content and method of studies
 queens college, banaras main pravesh liya, teen-chaar varshon tak college aate-jate rahe par yahan se man baar-baar bhaagta rahaa
 The memory power was intense, the eclipse ability amazing
 isliye parikshaon main uteern hote rahe
 In those days in Benares, English-educated and famous writer - King Shivprasad was 'starshind', Bharatendu used to go to his disciple
 unheen se angreji sikhi
 Bhartendu learned Sanskrit, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu languages from Swadhyay
 unako kavy-pratibha apane pita se viraasat ke rup main mili thi
 He narrated to his father by making the following couplet at the age of five years and received the blessings of being a poet
 dhan ke atyadhik vyay se bhaaratendu ji rini ban gaye or duschintaaon ke kaaran unka sharir shithil hota gaya
 As a result, he died in 1885 at an early age
 bharatendu ke vrahat saahitiyik yogadan ke kaaran hi 1857 se 1900 tak ke kaal ko bharatendu yug ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, pandrah varsh kii avasthaa se hi bhaaratendu ne sahitya seva prarambh kar di thi
 At the age of eighteen, he brought out a magazine called 'kavikavasudha', in which the writings of the great scholars of that time were printed
 ve bees varsh kii avasthaa main onreri magistrate banaae gaye or aadhunik hindi sahitya ke janak ke rup me pratishthit hue
 She published 'kavikavasudha' in 1868, 'harishchandra Magazine' in 1873 and 'bala Bodhini' for women's education in 1874
 saath hi unke samaantar saahitiyik sansthaayen bhi khadi kin
 He founded the 'tadiya Samaj' to promote Vaishnava devotion
 rajbhakti prakat karte hue bhi, apni deshbhakti kii bhaavana ke kaaran unhen angreji hukumat kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa
 Impressed by his popularity, the scholars of Kashi conferred him the title of 'bharatendu' in 1880
 hindi sahitya ko bharatendu kii dein bhashaa tathaa sahitya donon hi kshetron main he
 In the field of language, he distinguished the form of Khadi dialect which is different from Urdu and has been enhanced by taking the juice of the dialects of Hindi region
 isi bhashaa main unhone apane sampoorn gadhy sahitya kii rachana kii
 Along with literature service, social service of Bharatendu ji also continued
 unhone kai sansthaaon kii sthapana main apana yoga diya
 He considered it his duty to help the afflicted, literate and friends
 pramukh nibandh Amazing dream ek kahani- kuch aapbeetee, kuch jagabiti It was the specialty of Bharatendu ji that where he wrote poems on ancient subjects like devotion to God, he also adopted new subjects like social reform, national love etc
 bhaaratendu kii rachanaaon main angreji shashan kaa virodh, swatantraaa ke liye uddaam aakanksha or jaateey bhavabodh kii jhalak milti he
 It was a new thing at that time to try to organize people for the spread of modern consciousness in a society stuck in feudal tightness
 unke sahitya or naveen vichaaron ne us samay ke tamaam sahityakaron or buddhijiviyon ko jhakzora or unke ird-gird rashtriya bhaawanaaon se ot-prot lekhakon kaa ek aisa samooh ban gaya jise bharatendu mandal ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the subject, his poem is Shringar-dominated, Bhakti-dominated, social problem-oriented and national love-oriented
 shringaar ras pradhanbharatendu ji ne shringaar ke sanyog or viyog donon hi pakshon kaa sundar chithran kiya he
 See a picture of disconnection- bhakthi pradhanbharatendu ji krishna ke bhakt the or pushti maarg ke maanane vaale the
 He has a vision of true devotional spirit in the poem
 ve kaamana karte hai - Social problem Pradhan Bhartendu ji depicted many social problems in his poetry
 unhone samaaj main vyaapt kuritiyon par tikhe vyangy kiye
 They did not leave even the moneylenders and the bribe takers - raashtra-prem pradhanbharatendu ji ke kavy main raashtra-prem bhi bhaavana spasht drushtigochar hoti he
 They present the tableau of India's ancient glory in these words - prakritik chitranprakruti chithran main bhaaratendu ji ko adhik safalataa nahin mili, kyonki ve maanav-prakruti ke shilpi the, bahya prakruti main unka marmpurna roopen nahin ram paaya
 Hence, most of his nature depiction lacks the power to attract the human heart
 chandravali naatika ke yamuna-varnan main avashya sajivta he tathaa uski upamaayen or utprekshaayen naveenta liye hue hai- See this example of the nature description, in which the beauty of Yamuna is very visible
 bharatendu ke samay main rajkaaj or sambhraant varg kii bhashaa farsi thi
 At the same time, the dominance of English was also increasing
 sahitya main brajabhasha kaa bolbalaa tha
 Persian influenced Urdu also came into vogue
 aise samay main bharatendu ne lokbhashaon or farsi se mukt urdu ke aadhaar par khadi boli kaa vikaas kiya
 The Hindi we write today is a gift of Bharatendu
 yahi kaaran he ki unhen aadhunik hindi kaa janak mana jaataa he
 Not only the language, he incorporated new modern consciousness in literature and associated literature with 'jan'
 bharatendu kii rachanadharmita main doharaapan dikhataa he
 While he continued to write poetry in the Braj language, he tried his hand in other genres in a standing bid
 sahi myne main kahen to bhaaratendu aadhunik khadi boli gadhy ke unnayak hai
 The language of poetry of Bharatendu is mainly Braj language
 unhone braj bhashaa ke aprachlit shabdon ko chhod kar uske parikrisht rup ko apanaaya
 Urdu and English are also widely used words in their language
 unke gadhy kii bhashaa saral or vyavhaarik he
 Idioms are used efficiently
 bhaaratendu ji ke kavy main nimnlikhit shaileyon ke darshan hote hai - 1
 Ritual style of juicy decking style - in erotic poems, 2
 bhavatmak style - bhakthi ke padon main, 3
 Sarcastic style - in social reforms, 4
 udbodhan style - desh-prem kii kavitaaon main
 Bharatendu ji has composed poetry in almost all the rasas
 shringaar or shant rason kii pradhanta he
 Bharatendu ji has beautifully described both sides of the dressing
 unke kavy main hasya ras kii bhi utkrisht yojana milti he
 Bharatendu ji has adopted almost all the verses prevalent in his time
 unhone keval hindi ke hi nahin urdu, sanskrit, bangala bhashaa ke chhandon ko bhi sthaan diya he
 In his poetry, Sanskrit Basant Tilaka, Shardul, Vikritish, Shalini etc
 are used in Hindi Chaupai, Chappay, Rolla, Soratha, Kundaliya Kavitta, Savaiya Ghanachhari etc
, Bangar Pyar and Urkha Rekta, Ghazal verses
 inke atirikt bhaaratendu ji kajli, thumari, laavani, malhaar, chaiti aadi lok chhandon ko bhi vyavhaar main laae hai
 Alankars are used in Bharatendu's poetry naturally
 upama, utpreksha, roopak or andeh alankaaron ke prati bhaaratendu ji kii adhik ruchi he
 Linguistics also has a place
 nimna panktiyon main utpreksha or anupras alankaar kii yojana spasht dikhaai detii he: Bharatendu ji holds a very important place in modern Hindi literature
 bhaaratendu bahoomukhi pratibha ke swami the
 Poetry, story, drama, novels, essays etc
 are unique in all fields
 bhaaratendu ji hindi main nav jaagran kaa sandesh lekar avatarit hue
 He did important work in the all-round development of Hindi
 bhav, bhashaa or style main naveenta tathaa moulikta kaa samavesh karke unhen aadhunik kaal ke anuroop banaaya
 He is considered to be the father of modern Hindi
 hindi ke naatakon kaa sutarapaat bhi unheen ke dwaara hua
 Bharatendu ji was the literary leader of his time
 unase kitne hi pratibhashali lekhakon ko janm mila
 In the service of the mother tongue, he not only gave his life but also paid full money
 hindi bhashaa kii unnati unka moolmantra tha - In his testimony before the Education Commission in 1882, on the importance of making Hindi the language of the courts, he said- isi sandarbh main 1868 i main 'urdu kaa syapa' nium se unhone ek vyangy kavita likhi- Due to these works, Bharatendu became a grand constellation of Hindi literature and his era became known as Bharatendu era
 harishchandra chandrika, kavivachansudha, harishchandr megsine, stri bala bodhini jaise prakaashan unke vichaarsheel or pragatisheel sampadakeey drushtikon kaa parichay dete hai
 The most important work of Bharatendu is that he inspired Hindi literature, and with it, society to move in anti-imperial direction
 1870 main jab kavivachansudha main unhone lord mayo ko lakshya karke 'levi praan levi' naamak lekh likhaa tab se hindi sahitya main ek nayi samrajya-virdohi chetana kaa prasar armbh hua
 On 6 July 1874, he wrote in Kavibhasudha that in the same way as America became colonized and became independent, in the same way India can also gain independence
 unhone tadeey samaaj kii sthapana kii jiske sadsy swadeshi vastuon ke vyavhaar or videshi vastuon ke bahishkaar kii pratigya karte the
 The Swadeshi manifesto published in the 'kavikavasudha' dated March 23, 1874, by Bhartendu, appealing for the boycott of luxury clothes, became the pledge letter of the entire Hindi society
 usamen bhaaratendu ne kaha tha, First of all, Bharatendu Harishchandra gave voice to public sentiments and aspirations in literature
 pehali baar sahitya main 'jan' kaa samavesh bharatendu ne hi kiya
 His first poetry was dominated by ritualistic tendencies
 sahitya patansheel saamanti samskruti kaa poshak ban gaya tha, par bharatendu ne sahitya ko janata kii garibi, paradheenata, videshi shaskaon ke amanviya shoshan ke chithran or uske virodh kaa madhyam bana diya
 Through his plays, poems, reticent and slurs, he attacked and attacked the British Raj, due to which he also had to become a partisan of the British
 bhaaratendu angrejon ke shoshan tantra ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhate the
 In his magazine Kavikavasudha, he wrote - yahi nahin, 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main dadabhai nauroji ne dhan ke apvahan yani dren of velth ke jis siddhanth ko prastut kiya tha, bharatendu ne bahut pehle hi shoshan ke is rup ko samaj liya tha
 she wrote - angrej bharat kaa dhan apane yahaan lekar chale jate hai or yahi desh kii janata kii garibi or kashton kaa mul kaaran he, is sachai ko bhaaratendu ne samaj liya tha
 In Kavikavasudha, he called upon the public - bharatendu kii vaishvik chetana bhi atyant prakhar thi
 He was well aware of which countries of the world are progressing and how much
 isliye unhone san 1884 main baliya ke dadri meley main 'bharatvarshonnati kaise ho sakati he' par atyant sargarbhit bhaashan diya tha
 This article is also a reflection of his very progressive thinking
 isamen unhone logon se kuritiyon or andhvishwaason ko tyagkar acchhee-se-acchhee shiksha praapt karne, udyog-dhandhon ko viksit karne, sahyog evam ekta par bal dene tathaa sabhi kshetron main aatmanirbhar hone kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 Bharatendu's speech from the literary stage of religious and folk fairs like Dadri is seen as a departure point for modern Indian social, political and economic thought
 bhaashan kaa ek chota sa ansh dekhie- This essay is a unique example of how clarity of ideas and how it can be presented with humor
 dekhie, kis tarah bharat kii chintaa is nibandh main bhaaratendu vyakt karte hai, In fact, his article is a kind of ideological extension of his play called Bharat Plight
 bharat durdasha main ve kehete hai, Bhartendu had understood well that 'english rule is for the benefit of Indians' This was a completely hollow claim and was propaganda
 angrej kis tarah bharat kii sampada lut rahe the, iskaa sanket bharatendu ne 'kavivachansudha' ke 7 march, 1874 ke ank main apni tippanee main diya, Bharatendu was such a great advocate of the equality of men and women that in the November 3, 1873 issue of 'kavikavasudha', he wrote, 1473 gregory calendar kaa ek saadhaaran varsh he
 Hal, Hayel or Hayil is also a city located northwest of Saudi Arabia, pronounced

 'bajirao Mastani' is an Indian historical romance film directed and produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film maratha samrajya ke peshwa bajirao or uski duusari patni mastaani ke bare main bataati he
 Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone have both played the lead characters, Priyanka Chopra plays Bajirao's first wife and Tanvi Azmi plays Bajirao's mother
 bajirao mastaani 18 disambar 2015 ko release hui he
 Bajirao Mastani film starts with the making of new Peshwa, Bajirao is chosen for this, after which people of all empires celebrate in this happiness
 phir achaanak bundelkhand se mastaani sahaayta ke liye aati he or bajirao ke sainikon se ladakar sidhe bajirao se milti he or unako manaakar bundelkhand le jaati he vahaan wo vahaan par pratidwindeeyon se donon milakar yuddh karte he or vahaan par vijay praapt karte hai
 After this, Bajirao celebrates Holi in Bundelkhand, meanwhile, Bajirao and Mastani fall in love
 duusare din bajirao waapas pune chale jate hai
 Meanwhile, while leaving, Bajirao gives his dagger to Mastani, due to which he gets married to a dagger in Bundelkhand, under this tradition Mastani goes to Pune
 vahaan par wo bajirao kii mata radhabai se milti he
 Radhabai does not want Mastani, because of this she starts hating
 iske baad chimaji appa shanivarwara dikhaate he tathaa isamen adbhut aainamahal bhi dikhaate hai
 When Mastani asks Radha Bai to accept the relationship, she gives it to Ghungroo and says that since now your relationship has been done, from now on you will dance in the festival
 phir satara se chhatrapati sahu kaa bulaava aata he tab bajirao vahaan jate he phir radhabai ek nai chaal chalati he or mastaani ko ghunghru dekar bhej detii he lekin mastaani vahaan pahunchakar ghunghru chhatrapati sahu ke saamne ghunghru rakh detii he is kaaran pant pratinidhi mehafil kaa apmaan maanate he lekin jab chhatrapati sahu ko pataa chalata he ki wo raja chhatrasaal kii beti he to wo inhen waapas jane ke liye kha dete he or bolte he ki tumhen kya chahie tab mastaani bolti he ki maine bajirao se ishq kiya he bajirao chahie
 After this Mastani waits for Bajirao when a storm comes and Bajirao comes there and marries Mastani
 isi bich kashibai ko bhi pataa chal jaataa he or wo bhi naaraaz ho jaati he
 Then Kashibai and Mastani have sons and are named
 kashibai ke putr kaa naam raghunatha rakhte he jabaki mastaani ke putr kaa naam samsher bahadur naam rakh dete hai
 Meanwhile, a fight ensues between Bajirao and Chimaji Appa
 bajirao sabhi se kahata he ki wo saptami ke din mastaani ko shanivarwara laaenge parantu krishnabhat or radhabai ye nahin karne ko kehete hai
 The film is based on Rau, an excellent historical novel by well-known Marathi novelist Nagnath Inamdar
 yah upanyaas marathi hi nahin balki sampurna bhartiya bhashaaon ke saphaltam aitihaasik upanyaason main se ek he
 In this, excellent prolificity has been introduced while protecting both history and historiography
 is upanyaas main swaabhaavik rup se bharpoor naatakeeyata vidyaman he or padhate hue aisa lagata he jaise koi uttam dharawahik dekh rahe hon
 Its descriptive scenes are also engraved on the psyche like movie scenes
 aise upanyaas par aadhaarit hone se film main anek visheshtaayen swaabhaavik rup se aa gayi hai
 This story has shone even further by a proven director like Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film main paathya rachana se kuch antar aa janaa to swaabhaavik hi rahata he kyonki donon ke madhyam bhinn hote hai, parantu is film main kuch antar jaanboojhkar filmi latakon-jhatkon ke rup main laaye gayi hai, jisase itihaas-bodh ko dhakka pahunchaa he
 In the early scenes, the scene appointing Bajirao as Peshwa is also very good and appropriate, and despite being outside the novel, it is completely consistent with the historicity and sense of history; But the scene in which Kashibai's old friend, whose husband Peshwa is killed due to Bajirao and therefore curses her husband by leaving her ashes there, has made a clear distinction
 upanyaas main kashibai kii kushal gruhinee ke rup main garimamayi upasthiti he, jabaki film main kashibai ko chanchal kishori kii taraf uchhalte dikhalaakar itihaas bodh ko khandit kar diya gaya he
 The filmmaker has also forgotten that the son of Kashibai, who is filming like this, is getting young and he was the main doer of that festival
 yahan kashibai peshwa kii patni na lag kar filmi heroin 'priyanka chopra' hi lagati he
 The carrying of Bajirao by army with the help of Chhatrasal has also become absolutely historic
 dekhne main bahut rochak he, lekin mastaani ke dwaara aisa na to hua tha, na ho saktaa tha
 Even leaving aside such minor scenes, the filmmaker has made two unforgivable mistakes - Srimanta Bajirao Peshwa and Kashibai have been caught at different times
 us yug main or peshwa parivaar main kashibai jaisi stri, jo ek tarah se rani hi thi, yadi naachati hoti to nartkiyon ko vishesh rup se rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin hoti
 The special thing in that too is that at the time when Kashibai is danced with Mastani in the film, the pain in her foot was increased even more in those days
 mastaani se kashibai kii bhent bhi bilkul bhinn tareeke kii or filmi latakon-jhatkon vaali ho gayi he
 Therefore, for the sake of creative enjoyment with historicity, the above novel has to be read, but the film has done the task of taking the extraordinary love story and great life of Mahan Bajirao Peshwa and Mastani to people outside of Maharashtra as well, for this film The filmmaker definitely deserves thanks
 lagbhag sabhi kalakaaron kaa abhinay bhi jivant evam prashansaneey he, jo film ko baar-baar dekhne ke liye prerit karata he
 In the year 2003, Sanjay Leela Bhansali selected Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai for the lead character of this film
 jo unki film ham dil de chuke sanam main bhi mukhya kirdaar main the
 But later they had to change due to differences between them
 iske baad july 2003 main unhone karina kapur or rani mukherjee ko bajirao kii patni ke paatr ke liye chunaa
 Bhansali ji told in Koffee with Karan that he could not take Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor because he was already working in another film
 kuch logon main yah bhi afvaah thi kii ajay devgan kii jagah shahrukh khan yah kirdaar nibhaaenge
 Apart from this, Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone were expected to be Ranveer Singh and Katrina Kaif
 july 2014 main bhansaali ji ne satyapit kiya kii is pariyojna main ranvir singh or deepika padukon ko is film main mukhya kirdaar chunaa
 Also Priyanka Chopra will play the role of Bajirao's wife
 bhansaali ji ne daksha seth ko unhe taiyaar karne kii zimmedaari di
 Ranveer Singh will learn Marathi language and horse riding for this film
 is film main apane damdaar kirdaar ke liye ranvir apana vajan bhi badhayenge
 With this, Priyanka Chopra will also take Marathi education for 15 days

 Improvement in agricultural production, increase in production and productivity harith kranti athwa bhartiya krishi main lagu kii gai nai vikaas vidhi kaa sabase bada laabh yah hua ki desh main fasalon ke kshetrafal main vruddhi, krishi utpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi ho gai
 There was an unprecedented increase in production of wheat, millet, paddy, maize and sorghum in particular
 jiske parinaam swaroop khadyannon main bharat aatmanirbhar-sa ho gaya
 The total production of food grains in the country in 1951-1952 was 5
09 million tonnes, which increased to 238 million tonnes respectively in 2008-2009
 isi tarah prati hectares utpaadakta main bhi paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 Production of food grains was 522 kg / ha in 1950–1951, which increased to 1,893 kg / ha in 2008–2009
 haan, bharat main khadyann utpaadanon main kuch ucchavachan bhi hua he, jo bure mausam aadi ke kaaran rahaa jo yah siddh karata he ki desh main krishi utpaadan abhi bhi mausam par nirbhar karata he
 Changes in the traditional form of agriculture harith kranti ke falswaroop kheti ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan hua he or kheti vyavsaayik drushti se kii jane lagi he
 Whereas earlier it was used only to fill the stomach
 desh main ganna, kapaas, patson tathaa tilhanon ke utpaadan main vruddhi hui he

 Strengthening forward and backward relationships naveen praudyogiki tathaa krishi ke aadhunikaran ne krishi tathaa udyog ke paraspar sambandh ko or bhi majboot bana diya he
 Traditionally, though the forward link between agriculture and industry was already strong, because many inputs are made available to industries by the agricultural sector
 parantu in donon main pratigaami sambandh bahut hi kamazor tha, kyonki udyog nirmit vastuon kaa krishi main bahut hi kam upyog hota tha
 But as a result of modernization of agriculture, there has been a huge increase in the demand for industrial manufactured inputs in agriculture, such as agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, etc
, due to which the retrograde relationship of agriculture has also been strengthened
 anya shabdon main krishi evam audyogic kshetra ke sambandhon main adhik majbootee ai he
 It is thus clear that there has been a substantial improvement in agricultural inputs and production in the country as a result of the Green Revolution
 iske falswaroop krishak, sarkaar tathaa janata sabhi main yah vishwaas jaagrath ho gaya he ki bharat krishi padaarthon ke utpaadan ke kshetra main aatmanirbhar hi nahin ho saktaa, balki niryaat bhi kar saktaa he
 Analysis desh main yojana kaal main krishi ke kshetra main paryaapt vikaas hua he
 The total agricultural area has increased, the nature of the crop has changed, the irrigated area has increased, the use of chemical fertilizers has increased and modern agricultural machines have started being used
 in sab baton ke hote huye bhi abhi tak desh main krishi kaa vikaas uchit str tak nahin pahunch paaya he, kyonki yahan prati hectares krishi utpaadan anya viksit deshon kii tulana main kam he
 It now studies importing many agricultural products
 kyonki unka utpaadan maang kii tulana main kam he
 a large part of the agricultural sector is still unirrigated
 krishi main yantrikaran kaa str abhi bhi kam he, jisase utpaadan laagat adhik aati he
 Farmers do not get sufficient departmental facilities, which hinders agricultural development
 atah is baat kii aavashyaktaa he ki krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudhaaron ko adhik kargar dhang se lagu kar krishi kshetra kaa or adhik vikaas kiya jaye
 Expansion of green revolution kendriya bajet 2010-2011 main krishi kshetra ke vikaas ke liye banaai gayi kaary yojana ke pehle ghatak main gram sabhaaon tathaa kisaan pariwaron ke sakriy sahyog se desh ke purvi kshetra bihar, chhattisgarh, purvi uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal tathaa urisa main harith kranti ke vistaar ke liye 400 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Drawbacks and problems desh main harith kranti ke falswaroop kuch fasalon ke utpaadan main paryaapt vruddhi hui he, khadyanno ke aayaat main kami ai he, krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan aayaa he, phir bhi is kaarykram main kuch kamiyaan parilakshith hoti hai
 The major shortcomings and problems of the Green Revolution can be presented as follows: prabhaav - harith kranti kaa prabhaav kuch vishesh fasalon tak hi simit rahaa, jaise- gehun, jowar, bajra
 There has been no impact on other crops
 yahan tak ki chaaval bhi isse bahut hi kam prabhavit hua he
 Business crops are also unaffected by this
 poonjivadi krishi ko badhaava - adhik upjau kism ke beej ek puunji-gahan kaarykram hai, jisamen urvarkon, sinchai, krishi yantron aadi aagton par baari maatra main nivesh karnaa padataa he
 Investing heavily is beyond the capacity of small and medium-sized farmers
 is tarah, harith kranti se laabh unheen kisaanon ko ho rahaa he, jinke paas nijee pumping set, tractor, nalakup tathaa anya krishi yantra hai
 This facility is available only to big farmers of the country
 saamaanya kisaan in suvidhaon se vanchit hai
 The need for institutional reforms is not emphasized - the need for institutional reforms has been completely ignored in the new development method
 sansthagat parivartano ke antargat sabase mahatvapurn ghatak bhu-dhaaran kii vyavastha he

 desh main bhoomi sudhaar kaarykram safal nahin rahe hai tathaa lakhon krishakon ko aaj bhi bhu-dhaaran kii nischitata nahin pradaan kii ja saki he
 The problem of labor displacement - Due to agricultural mechanization used under the Green Revolution, labor displacement has got a boost
 gramin jansankhya kaa rojgaar kii talash main shaharon kii ore palaayan karne kaa yah bhi ek kaaran he
 Increasing income inequality - Technological changes in agriculture have the opposite effect on income distribution in rural areas

 Regional imbalance - The impact of Green Revolution is limited to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu
 iskaa prabhaav sampoorn desh par naa fail paane ke kaaran desh kaa santulit rup se vikaas nahin ho paaya
 In this way, the Green Revolution has been a limited success
 harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye suzav Promoting Institutional Changes - Land reform programs must be implemented effectively and comprehensively for the success of the Green Revolution
 bataaidaron ko swaamitv kaa adhikaar dilaayaa janaa chahie
 The excess land obtained from the demarcation should be distributed among the landless cultivators
 chakbandi kaa prabhavi banaakar joton ke vibhaajan par prabhavi roak lagaayi jaani chahie
 Facility of agricultural finance - While increasing the facilities of agricultural finance, small farmers should be provided with a credit facility at concessional rate so that they can purchase necessary advanced seeds, chemical fertilizers and agricultural implements
 rojgaar ke avasaron main vruddhi - shram pradhan takneekon ko apanaaya janaa chahie tathaa gramin kshetron main bekaari kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye kutir evam gram udyogon kaa teji se vistaar kiya janaa chahie
 Development of means of irrigation - Adequate development of irrigation facilities should be done in the country, so that farmers can take full advantage of high yielding varieties
 is sandarbh main laghu sinchai pariyojnaon ke vistaar par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 Expansion of other structural reforms - Other structural facilities, including electricity, transport, necessary for the development of agriculture should be developed
 tabhi harith kranti anya fasalon tathaa kshetron tak fail sakegi
 Spread of Green Revolution to other crops - For the success of Green Revolution, it is necessary that it should be extended to the cultivation of rice and other crops
 chaaval ke saath daalen, kapaas, ganna, tilhan, jute aadi vyapaarik fasalon ke sambandh main bhi utpaadan vruddhi santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 Therefore, these crops should also be included in the area of green revolution
 chote khet or chote kisaanon ko sambaddh karnaa - chote kheton tathaa chote kisaanon ko bhi harith kranti se sambaddh karnaa chahie
 For this, it is necessary that land reform programs should be implemented quickly and effectively, small farmers should be provided credit facilities at moderate terms and rates for purchasing essential seeds, fertilizers etc
, simple agriculture
 In addition to the facilities given in connection with the purchase of equipment, hire large farm machinery such as tractors, harvesters etc
 on behalf of the government
 Should be taken, farmers with very small holdings should be motivated to adopt cooperative farming
 samanvit farm niti - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye samanvit farm niti apanaayi jaani chahie, taaki farm takniki va aagton ke mulyon ke sambandh main ek uchit niti apanaai ja sake tathaa krishakon ko unntshil beej, khaad, kitnashak tathaa krishi yantra evam upkaran uchit mulya par samay par uplabdh ho saken
 Apart from this, the government should make arrangements for the sale of all agricultural produce and should also guarantee to buy agricultural products at a reasonable price

 baar-baar pareekshan ke saath aprabhavi pratikriyaaon kam baar hua or safal pratikriyaaon adhik baar hua he, to billiyon adhik se adhik teji se bhaag nikle
 Thorndick generalizes this conclusion in his law of influence which states that behaviors followed by satisfactory results become repetitive and that those producing unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated
 sankshep main, kuch parinaam vyavhaar ko majboot banane or kuch parinaam vyavhaar kamjor
 Thorndick of plotting the escape time against test number produced curves by learning the first known animal through this process

 They produce adverse effects when they are not, or when reactions are retained and discarded, when they lead to a successful outcome
 yah aamtaur par kisi bhi " shikshak" dwaara yojana banaai ja rahi bina hota he, lekin condishning hajaaron saal ke liye apane bacchon ko padhaane main mata-pita dwaara istemaal kiya gaya he| Skinner is often known as the father of conditioning skinner ke kriyaprasut anukulan siddhant ke anusaar, vyavhaar ke parinaam, kriya ke hone kii sambhaavna ko prabhavit karte hai
 a behavior after which a soothing stimulus is associated is more likely to occur repeatedly, but it is less likely to occur if the other behavior is associated with a punitive stimulus
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek balak ke kisi vyavhaar ko agar ek muskaraahat dwaara pratikriya di jaae to us balak dwaara vah vyavhaar punah karne kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 But if there is an angry response to such behavior, then the chances of showing that behavior again are reduced
 udhaaharan ke liye, skinner ke anusaar ek bachche ke andar uske vaataavaran main upasthit anubhavon ke aadhaar par sharmaane kaa vyavhaar viksit ho saktaa he agar vaataavaran ko punah sthapit kar diya jaae to baccha saamaajik taur par kushal ho saktaa he
 According to Skinner, rewards and punishments shape a person's development

 isamen mathura, vrindavan, govardhan, gokul, mahaban, valdev, nandagaanv, varasanaa, deeg or kambon aadi bhagwaan shrikrishna ke sabhi lila-sthal sammilit hai

 The place where cows graze and roam is also called Braj
 amarkosh ke lekhak ne braj ke teen arth prastut kiye hai- goshth, maarg or vrund

 vaidic samhitaon tathaa ramayana, mahabharat aadi sanskrit ke pracheen dharmagranthon main braj shabd goshaala, go-sthaan, gochar bhoomi ke arthon main bhi prayukt hua he
 In the Rigveda, the word is described as a gaushala or a khirak of cows
 yajurveda main gaayon ke charne ke sthaan ko braj or goshaala ko goshth kaha gaya he

 In Harivamsa and Bhagavatpuranas, this word is used as Gop Basta

 Braj has been used in the same sense in the compositions of Surdas based on the Bhagavata
 mathura or uskaa nikatavarti bhu-bhaag pracheen kaal se hi apane saghan wanon, vistrut charaagahon, goshton or sundar gaayon ke liye prasiddh rahaa he

 isaliye shri krishna ke janm sthaan mathura or unki lilaon se samvadhit mathura ke aas-paas kaa samast pradesh hi braj athwa brajamandal kaha jane laga tha
 In this way the meaning of the word Braj has evolved in chronological order

 The size of Braj also expanded when the area of braj culture and Brajbhasha expanded due to Krishna worshipers and Brajbhasha poets
 us samay mathura nagar hi nahin, balki usase dur-dur ke bhu-bhaag, jo braj samskruti or braj-bhashaa se prabhavit the, vraj antargat maan liye gayi the
 Present kaal main mathura nagar sahit mathura jile kaa adhikansh bhaag tathaa rajasthan ke deeg or kambon kaa kuch bhaag, jahaan se brajayatra guzarati he, braj kaha jaataa he

 In January 1841, Sher Singh, son of Ranjit Singh, tried hard to seize the throne of Lahore, but failed because of the "jammu brothers"
 lahore ke qile kii suraksha kii zimmedaari gulab singh ke maddenzar thi
 It is known that Sher Singh attacked with a very large army of Akalis
 usne apni sena se kile ko chaaro taraf se gher liya tha, parantu kile kii topein or deevaaron ko bhedane main asafal rahe
 After the peace agreement between Dogras and Sher Singh, Gulab Singh was allowed to return to Jammu with weapons
 kaha jaataa he kii us avasar par gulab singh ne lahore ke khazaane kaa kaafii bada hissaa apane saath jammu laayaa tha
 During this time, a large part of the Dogra army was engaged in climbing on the hills of the northern Himalayas

 aisa gyaat he kii kaiyon ne khud ko garm rakhane kii naakaamayaab koshish main sena ke aslaa or barood ko bhi jala diya tha
 On 12 December 1841, the weakened Dogra army was defeated by the Tibetan army due to severe cold and lack of grocery and shelter
 is abhiyaan main jo jivit batch gaye the, ve dakshin disha kii ore bad kar himalay paar kar british-sashit ilaake main pahunch gaye

 Although the Sikh army failed to capture Jammu, they forced Gulab Singh to pay a lot of money
 lahori adaalat ne gulab singh par kul sattaees lakh nanakshahi rupayon kaa harzana lagaaya tha
 After this incident Gulab Singh decided to negotiate a secret agreement with the British

 raja gulab singh ne sikh sainikon ko to yuddh main bhej diya, parantu unhone sena kii kai gopniy kootnithik jaankaree angrezon ko de di
 After the war, Gulab Singh demanded a "reward" from the British in return for his help
 paraajay hone ke baad, sikhon ko shanti samjhaute par hastakshar karnaa padaa
 Under this, the defeated court was forced to transfer ownership over Jammu in favor of Gulab Singh
 angrez, jinke paas sikhon ko puri tarah mashchaul rakhane ke liye nishaparyapt sena thi, ne gulab singh ko jammu kaa maharaj niyukt karne kaa faisalaa kar diya
 At the same time, he also sold Kashmir Dhati to Gulab Singh at a cost of 75 lakh Nanakshahi rupees

 This incident set fire to the court of Lahore

 Enraged by this deception, the courtiers, especially Wazir Lal Singh, conspired to provoke the rebellion in Kashmir by provoking the Subedar of Kashmir

 a holler is a letter written with red blood that is sent for the purpose of expressing excessive anger or to convey a message publicly in a loud voice
 On opening it, the person receiving the voice of the sender recites the message screaming with anger and then the letter itself is destroyed
 If it is not opened or is delayed in opening, the letter automatically smokes, bursts with a louder sound and delivers a louder than usual message

 harry pouter and da chembar of sicrates main jab ron visli apane pita kii incanted car churaakar harry ke saath usamen udakar hallverts aa jaataa he to uski maa, moli visli use ek holer bhejti hai
 navial longabotom yah sweekaar karata he ki use bhi uski daadi maa kii taraf se ek baar ek holer mila tha
 He ignored the holler and due to this he had to suffer terrible consequences
 After this, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azbakan send Naval's grandmother to her in a holler again, when Serious Black Gryffindor uses her password list to enter the common room
 In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Hermione receives a holler when Rita Skeeter writes in one of her articles about the relationship between Harry and Hermione and Harry
 However, in the fourth Harry Potter film, this incident is not shown
 In Harry Potterie and the Order of Phoenix, when Harry's Uncle Vernon attempts to drive him out of his house, Dumbledore sends Holler to remind Petunia Dursley of his promise to keep Harry in a private drive
 
 In this film, Harry receives a gray colored holler from the Ministry of Magic, dilumineter ek yantra he jiskaa avishkaar albus dambaldor ne kiya tha, yah ek saamaanya cigarette liter jaisaa dikhataa he
 upyogkarta kii gopneeyata banaaye rakhane ke liye iskaa prayog kisi prakaash strot ke prakaash ko hataane yaa avashoshit karne or baad main paravartit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he

 The device was then seen in the Order of the Phoenix, where Dumbledore lends his delinquent to Moody, who uses it to transport Harry from the Dursley family home to No

 In Half Blood Prince, Dumbledore uses the delaminator to darken the private drive before once again taking Harry

 In the world of Harry Potter, the person wearing the invisibility cloak disappears
 There are many types of invisibility cloaks
 All are extremely rare and expensive and can be woven with the skins of the magical vegetarian demigais found in the Far East
 They can also be made an invisibility cloak by applying disinfection cham or beadjustment hex to an ordinary cloak
 Over time, these cloaks begin to lose their inexplicability, eventually they begin to fade and have the effect of many magical spells
 However, Harry's cloak, being one of three Deathly Hallows, is the actual invisibility cloak and will always remain invisible
 It does not affect ordinary mantras and sorcery
 invizibility clok ise pahanane vaale ko sirf dikhne se chhipate hai, arthath yah kisi ko ankhon dwaara dikhaayi to nahin padegaa kintu ise chhukar mahasoos kiya ja sakegaa or yah ise pahanane vaale ke thos sharir ko gaayab nahin kar saktaa sirf adrishy kar saktaa he
 haalanki phir bhi elester mudi kii jaadui mantrashakti vaali ankhen invizibility clok ko dekh leti hai
 billi or saanp jaise jeev anya ansi indriyon paa adhik nirbhar karte hai jo drishyata se prabhavit nahin hotin, jaise soonghnaa, shravan shakti or garmi kaa ehsaas aadi, isliye in jeevon se chhipane ke liye invizibility clok bahut safal nahin hote
 kitaab main jin dementres kaa varnan he unamem drshyendriya sakriy nahin hoti he balki iske sthaan par unhen maanviya niraashaa kaa indriyabodh hota he, yah indriyabodh bhi aisa hota he jo invizibiliti clok se kisi prakaar se prabhavit nahin hota
 It is believed that in addition to Harry's cloak, Moody also has two such cloaks
 One of these was taken from Sturgis Padmore in the book Order of Phoenix
 ek invizibility clok, senior barty crouch ke paas bhi tha, jise vah apane bete barty crouch junior ko chhipaane ke liye istemaal karata tha, jisase ki use jaadu kii duniya ke jail ajbakaan tak na le jaaya ja sake
 Several times in the series it is shown that the characters suspect it, or that they somehow have an "impression" that Harry Potter is present wearing an invisibility tee cloak: when Harry invades the invisibility tee cloak to snap Snape
 There is a suspicion of this, and he also leaps to catch something like a thin hair; Draco Malfoy realizes that Harry is in his own compartment on the train, and he successfully binds his body by Patrificus Totalus Charm) while Harry was wearing an invisibility cloak
 hand of glori kaa varnan baurgin and barks main ek kushan par rakhkar pradarshit kiye gaye ek bade jhurridaar haath ke rup main kiya gaya he
 film harry potter and da chembar of sicrates main, jab harry ek hand of glori par apana haath rakhata he to use apana haath waapas nikaalane main bahut pareshaani hoti he
 jab is hand of glori par ek mombatti rakhi jaati he to yah sirf us vyakti ko prakaash detii he jo ise pakade rahata he
 pehali baar iskaa zikr chembar of sicrates main tab kiya gaya tha jab dreko or uske pita, lucius malphoy, nocttern aile sthit dark arts shop baurgin and barks main ghoomane jate hai
 lucius dreko dwaara ise kharidne ke anurodh ko yah kehete hue manaa kar detaa he ki yah saamaanya choron dwaara prayog kiya jane vaala ek upkaran he
 chhathin kitaab main, dreko room of riquirement se jate samay iskaa prayog karata he, vah instent darkeness powder kaa istemaal karne ke baad ron or dambaldor kii sena ke kuch anya sadasyon se bachakar bhaag rahaa tha
 Prohibited books include: baurgin and barks main milane vaali kuch anaam vasteen Items found in knockturn alley number 12 grimuld place main milane vaali vasteen The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects and the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows focuses on them
 The format, function and purpose of each hallow is revealed as the story progresses
 Harry, Ron and Hermione talk to Xenophilus Lovegood while searching for Voldemort's horcruxes
 He is Luna's father, who tells the three that the discovery of these famous hallows is called Quest
 Another thing is that, very few believe this story, although many people, such as Victor Krum, believe that the signs of Deathly Hallows are signs of Galart Grindewald, according to Krum it is a wall in his school, Darmstreng
 But has been written by Grindlewald himself
 At first, Hermione did not believe Hallows and said that it was all fairy tale, but Mr
 After talking to Allwinder, she was forced to believe that all this is indeed true
 da tail of bidal da board ke da tail of thri bros ke anusaar, peveral bros ne death ko praapt kar liya tha
 Daith offers her to ask for any item of her will; The first brother asked for a stick that could not be defeated in the fight, the second asked for a way to bring back a dead person, and the third brother asked for a cloak that could conceal the wearer from death
 According to Rowling, the story of the existence of these items is based on Geoffrey Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale
 elder vaind, jise puure itihaas main dethstic or vaind of destini ke naam se janaa jaataa he, ek atyant shaktishaalee vaind he jo elder kii lakdi main thestral tail hair ke kor dwaara banaayi jaati he
 yah kathith rup se sabase shaktishaalee vaind he jo astitv main he or jab iskaa prayog iske vaastavik maalik dwaara kiya jaataa he, to vah kisi bhi dwand yuddh main haraaya nahin ja saktaa / sakati, haalanki dambaldor ke anusaar yah jhooth he, kyonki unhone kaala jaadu karne vaale jaadugar grindlewald ke saath apane aitihaasik veertapurna yuddh main elder vaind ko haraaya tha
 It also seems that this wand will not cause any real harm to the owner, because this wand is somewhat sensitive
 As Mr
 Wand Mister
 Allwander said, the wand will not work perfectly for any new user unless the new owner of the wand has disarmed, stunned or killed its old owner directly
 Rowling has said that, in the choice of his boss, this wand is very cruel, while all the other wands have some loyalty to their old boss, but the Elder wand only works for a powerful person
 If its owner dies from natural death without losing to anyone, then all the powers of the wand will end for any owner, because he could not win it from its old owner
 sabase pehle elder vaind kii shakti kahani main tab pradarshit hui thi jab antiok peveral ne, joki teen puranic bhaaiyon main se pehle or sabase vruddh the, us vyakti ke saath yuddh kiya jise ve kaaphi samay se haraana chaahate the
 vah jeet gaya or apane dushman ke mrit sharir ko vahiin zamin par chhod diya
 After praising his never-defeated wand with pride, Peverel was killed in his sleep by an enemy who wanted to take the wand under his control
 tab se hi, jaadui shakti ke bhukhe jaadugar vaind ki talash main lage rahete hai or yah un teen hellos main se ek he jis tak itihaas ke madhyam se aasaani se pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 antat yah gregorovich ke adhikaar main aa gayi, jo ek bulgarian vaind banane vaala tha
 Gregorovich also used to talk about this wand with pride, he thought that it would make him famous, when he had to compete with the all-rounder, he also tried a reverse engineer on the mystery of that wand
 It then passed to the authority of Gellert Grindlewald, who stole it from Gregorovich
 antat dambaldor ne grindlewald ko haraa diya or iske baad elder vaind ko apane niyantran main le liya
 dambaldor kaa maananaa tha ki "teen hellos main se yah maatr hello he, jise rakhane ke liye vah upyukt hai, garv ke saath isapar adhikaar karne ke liye yaa isse kisi kii htya karne ke liye nahin, balki ise apane vash main rakhane ke liye
" When Dumbledore ensured his death by Severus Snape, he still intended that Snape would eventually "go to the Elder Wand
" Because he was not to be killed by his defeat, and Dumbledore thought that this would end all the powers of that wand
 However, Draco Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore even before Snape killed Dumbledore, so the plan failed - thus Draco inadvertently became the new owner of the Wand, although he never physically materialized with Dumbledore
 This wand could not be found, and the Elder Wand was placed in the tomb with Dumbledore's dead body
 antim kitaab main, voldemort ko vaind ke bare main pataa chalata he or vah uski khoj main nikal padataa he, ant main use yah pataa chalata he ki vaind dambaldor ke paas thi
 vah dambaldor kii samadhi ko kholta he or vaind ko apane adhikaar main le letaa he
 galati se vah bhi yahi maan baithta he ki snep hi vaind kaa vartmaan maalik he, voldemort snep kii htya kar detaa he or usiyah nahin pataa chal pataa ki vaind dreko ke adheen he 
 iske baad, voldemort kii gaiyr-jaankaree ke, harry drek ko ko nirstra kar detaa he or uski vaind le letaa he, isliye ab elder vaind harry ke adheen ho jaati he
 During his final encounter with Harry in the Battle of Hogwarts, he learns that the Elder Wand is not actually in his control, as he has not obtained this Wand by the assassination of its former owner
 Despite this, Voldemort uses the Elder Wand to effect his final killing curse in response to Harry's Expediramus Charm
 But since Wand was under Harry, the curse effected by Voldemort goes upside down and he dies in one go
 After this, Harry himself uses the Elder Wand to repair a window made of his ruined holly and feathers of Phoenix and says that he is "happier with them
" ek saakshaatkaar ke dauraan rouling ne yah raaj kholaa ki harry potter and da dethale hellos ke liye pehla kaaryakari sheershak harry potter and da elder vaind tha
 Resurrection stone enables the keeper to contact dead people
 In connection with the origin of the Deathly Hallows, according to the legend, the use of the Resurrection Stone resulted in its real owner, Cadmus Paverell, seeing his dead fiancée but committing suicide by not actually getting along with her
 By the time this stone was seen to be under the authority of Marvolo Gaunt, it had been installed in a ring with the Deathly Hallows inscribed on it, which Gaunt believed to be the patriarch of Peverell
 Both Dumbledore and Grindlewald wanted possession of this stone, but for different reasons
 Dumbledore wanted to contact it with his dead family, while Grindle Wald wanted to use it to prepare an army of corpses
 is anguthi kii jaadui shaktiyon ko nahin jaanane ke kaaran voldemort ne ise ek horkrax main badal diya tha
 Dumbledore obtained this ring from Marvolo's personal possessions, identifying it as both a Horcrux and one of the Deathly Hallows
 dambaldor bhul gaye ki yah anguthi ek horkrax he or sambhawatah voldemort ne ise kisi shraap main baandha bhi hoga, isiilie apni vyaktigat ichha se prerit hokar unhone iskaa prayog apane mrit parivaar se sampark karne ke liye kar liya
 haalanki, is abhishaap ke falswaroop unka haath nasht ho gaya or yah is shaap kaa asar unke puure sharir main failane laga
 haalanki shaap kaa asar kuch had tak snep dwaara nasht kiye gaye or kaale pad chuke haath main rah gaya, lekin phir bhi dambaldor abhishpt ho gaye or ab unke paas jeene ke liye adhiktam ek varsh hi shesh rah gaya
 Harry later gets possession of the stone, according to the will of Dumbledore hidden inside the snitch, during his first Quidditch match, Harry was about to swallow the snitch
 naak sandesh jab harry ke hothon se chuaa "main paas main khule 'kaa pataa chalaa
 snitch main yah sandesh chipa tha ki "ai open at da close" wain tanned bai haris lips
 harry tab tak snitch ko khol nahin pataa jab tak ki vah apni mrityu ke antim kshan tak nahin pahunch jaataa or use yah lagata he ki "da close" kaa arth he ant, yaa uske jivan kaa ant, arthath mrityu
 harry is stone kaa prayog apane mata-pita, syrius or rimas lupin se sampark karne ke liye karata he, vah voldemort se milane se pehle rimas lupin ko santvanaa dena chahat tha
 In the forbidden forest this stone slips with Harry's insensitive fingers
 Later, with Dumbledore's picture, Harry decides that neither he will try to find it nor tell others where the stone is
 In a 2007 interview, Rowling said that i would like to believe here that it has been permanently buried in the ground by the hooves of a centaur
 kinvadanti ke anusaar, clok of invizibility main ise pahanane vaale ko mrityu se bhi chipa lene kii shakti hoti he
 yah ek vaastavik invizibility clok he, vaastavik se aashay yah he ki yah pahanane vaale ko kisi bhi prakaar drishy nahin hone detaa he or is par samay yaa mantron kaa bhi koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 dethale hellos main, yah prakat gaya he ki harry kaa clok vastav main dethale hellos main se ek he
 vastav main yah ignotus peverel kaa tha
 After his death, this cloak passed from father to son and passed through descendants of Peverell to James Potter
 The night James died the night the cloak was not with James; He had already given this cloak to Dumbledore, who was very interested in the Deathly Hallows
 Dumbledore returned the cloak to Harry several years later as a Christmas present during his first year at Hogwarts
 Throughout the series, Harry uses this cloak to sneak around the school under numerous adventure adventures
 In the seventh book, Xenophilus Lovegood describes the third hello as saying it is a "real" invisibility cloak: other Cloaks either deteriorate over time or their ability to keep their wearer completely invisible decreases but Hallows' This cloak coming under will never be old nor will it ever be destroyed
 dethale hellos ke ant main, dambaldor harry ko yah samajhaate hai ki clok kaa vaastavik jaadu yah he ki yah apane maalik ke saath hi saath anya logon ko bhi adrishy rakh saktaa he
 yah tathy us samay spasht ho jaataa he jab saatvin kitaab main harry, ron or harmion ko chhipaane ke dauraan yah clok deth itors ke samaning charm par bhi pratikriya nahin karata
 This cloak keeps its wearer invisible in front of wizards and people without magical powers, but there are some creatures who get a sense of the person hidden inside it
 For example, snakes that cannot see inside the invulnerability cloak but do realize the speed and warmth and that is why they can find the people hidden inside it
 Mrs
 Norris, Flitch's cat, also appears to be looking at Harry when he walks around wearing it
 It can also be caught by the wearer's "hommen Charm"
 In Goblet of Fire, Moody's magic eye also sees Harry inside the cloak, which has no effect on being one of the cloak's deathly hallows, since the cloak's virtue does not make him effective against that spell
 Which has been put on Moody's eye
 However, this conclusion is incomplete because no description has been given regarding the way Moody's eyes can see many things
 In The Prisoner of Azkaban, Dumbledore warns Harry that Dementes' perception of humans is not limited by the invisibility cloak, as he experiences people based on emotion
 fo-glass ek sheesha he jo apane maalik ke dushmano ko ko pahachaanakar unhen unki shishe se duuri ke aadhaar par apane centre yaa centre se baahar dikhaata he

 The Maraders Map is a magic map of hogwarts created by James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupine and Peter Pettigrew, created by these people when they all studied at Hogwarts and often as a result of adventure adventures done during the night Detailed information was known about the school grounds and many secret paths etc
 pehali nazar main dekhne par yah nakshaa ek sada charm-patr kaa tukdaa lagata he; lekin jab ise upyog karne vaala apni wein ko isaki or karke yah kahata he ki, "ai solimoli swier dat ai em ap tu no good

 yah nakshaa hallverts ke durg ke andar or iske maidaanon main sthit logon kii sthiti bataata he or gopneey raaston kii sthiti tathaa un tak pahunchane ke nirdeshon ko bhi shaamil karata he
 haalanki, room of riquirements or chembar of sicrates jaise kai sthaan is naqshe main nahin dikhaayi padate, shaayad isliye ki maraders ko unke bare main jaankaree nahin thi yaa shaayad isliye ki room of riquirement jaisi jagahon ko naqshe par ankit karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 With this, it could not be dodged by Animagus Disguise, Polyjus Potion, and Invisibility Cloak, as shown in Goblet of Fire that Barty Crouch Jr
 uses Polyjous Potion to bring himself into Moody's disguise, Template: Peter Pettigrew in HP4 and Prisoner of Azerbaijan, who is believed to be dead Template: HP3 but has been transformed into a rat due to being an animagus, A

 tab se, yah nakshaa harry ke nirantar saahasik karnaamon main uskaa ek pramukh upkaran ban jaataa he or iskaa ullekh iske upyog ke dauraan prasangvash hi kiya gaya he
 The object form of this map made for films, at first sight, has lines written on it in the form of some irregular letters, but a careful look shows that probity prob concilment ke mantron or chhipi hui jaadui vastuon kaa pataa lagata he

 After Voldemort's return, the probes were used to strengthen the security system of the Gringots
 They are last seen in the Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrive at the Gringouts to rob the vault of one of Voldemort's horcruxes

 Asecurity sensor is a dark detector described as "an object that looked much like a twisted and golden television antenna
" When it catches a lie and something hidden it vibrates
 In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Moody states, "obviously this thing is not used here, there will be interference from every direction - because students everywhere lie about excuses for not doing their homework
 However, it may be that Moody was saying this because he was in fact Barty Crouch Jr
 who was made moody using polyjous potions
 order of finnics main, yah dikhaaya gaya he ki sikresi sensor kaa prayog ministry of magic main sthaneey sarkari aagantukon ke aane par atrium desk par kiya jaataa he

 Finally, in Deathly Hallows, Hermione gave Harry a sneoscope on his seventeenth birthday, which he used as a janitor while he was in hiding

 Later, during his first Christmas at Hogwarts, Harry finds a similar chess set in his wizard cracker
 During the extreme lessons of the Philosophers 'stone, Harry, Ron and Hermione become human-shaped chess pieces in a giant Wizards' chase
 During the reaction to the first trick, Ron uses Scandinavian Defense to check that the chess pieces have magic and they can destroy each other
 Later in the game, Ron sacrifices by Harry to successfully defeat Shay and the opponent's king

 Horcrux is a secret magic item used to achieve immortality
 The concept first appeared in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, although horcruxes were also present in previous novels but were not identified as such
 Rowling uses Horace Slughorn's descriptive dialogue to reveal that a murder is needed to make horcruxes, which, as a result of the act of ultimate evil, "divide the soul into pieces"
 After the assassination, a spell is performed to insert the separated part of the soul into an object and the object becomes a horcrux
 Rowling never published the actual magic related to it
 In the final book of the series, Hermione finds this mantra in a book called Secrets of the Darkest Arts
 hor kraks banane ke liye jeevadhariyon or nirjeev donon kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he, haalanki isamen jeevadhariyon kaa prayog jokhimpurna hota he, kyonki koi bhi jeevadharee apana bachaav kar saktaa he or soch saktaa he
 ek jaadugar dwaara banaaye ja sakane vaale horkrax kii sankhya aseemit he
 haalanki, isamen banane vaale kii aatma dhire-dhire kai chote tukdon main bantati jaati he, isliye vah apni swaabhaavik maanviyata khotachaala jaataa he or uski aatma atyadhik asthaayee ho jaati he
 atyadhik vishisht paristhitiyon main, aatma kaa ek tukdaa banane vaale kii jaankaree or iraade ke bina kisi vastu main band kiya ja saktaa he
 vah vastu jiske andar is prakaar se aatma kaa tukdaa surakshit kiya jaayegaa, anya kisi horkrax kii tarah hi banane vaale ke amartv ko sangrakshit karegi, kintu yah "gopneey jaadui vastu" ke antargat nahin aayegi
 aisi ghatana kaa ekmaatr udahaaran vah he jab voldemort ne asafalatapurvak ek varsh ke harry potter par kiling kars kaa prayog kiya tha
 Wolde Mock Mort's body was destroyed in this assassination attempt and a part of his soul was installed inside Harry
 horkraxes ko nasht karnaa behad mushkil hota he
 unhen paramparik tareekon jaise kuchalane, todane or jalaane dwaara nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 nasht kiye jane ke liye ek horkrax ko aisi bhayanak yatnaa deni padati he ki kisi bhi jaadui tareeke se uski marammat asambhav ho jaye
 bahut hi kam jaadui vasteen yaa mantra aisa kar paane kii shakti rakhte hai
 ek baar jab koi horkrax is prakaar nasht ho jaati he ki uski marammat na ho sake to uske andar upasthit aatma kaa bhaag bhi nasht ho jaataa he
 ek horkrax ko jaadui dhang se mukt karne kaa ek maatr tarika yahi he ki use banaae vaala iske liye kii gayi htya hetu ghor pashchaatap kare
 is pashchaatap ke dwaara hone vaali pidaa itani kshtdaayak hoti he ki vah vyakti is prakriya ke dauraan bhi mar saktaa he
saanchaa:hp7 The making of horcruxes by Voldemort was the central plot of later Harry Potter novels
 kyonki saat ek shaktishaalee, rahasyamay sankhya he or voldemort ne apni aatma ko saat bhaagon me baantne kii koshish kii thi, isamen se chah horkrax the or or aatma kaa antim bhaag uske sharir main tha
 When Voldemort attacked the Potter family, he intended to make his final horcrux by killing the "chosen child"
 apni haar ke baavjood bhi vah vastav main aisa kar paane main safal ho gaya; jab kiling kars ke paravartit ho jane ke kaaran uskaa sharir kshatigrast ho gaya tha to aise main uski aatma kaa ek bhaag alag hokar us kamare main maujuud ekmaatr anya jivit vastu -harry potter- main jaakar jud gaya tha or is prakaar vah chhathaan horkrax ban gaya tha
 Voldemort was unaware of this and he "executed" his work by making his snake Nagini a horcrux, thus dividing his soul into eight parts in total by seven
 This made the situation even more complicated, as the series never existed more than six horcruxes at a time: by the time Nagini was made a horcrux, one of the real horcruxes had been destroyed
 voldemort ke sabhi jabaran banaaye gaye horkrax un vastuon ke prayog dwaara banaaye gaye the jo uske liye mahatvapurn thim yaa jinka unke jivan main bhaavnaatmak mulya tha
 The following series of novels are described in the novel: gaublate of fire lakdi se banaaya gaya ek pyaalaa he or iskaa prayog prayek trivijard pratiyogita se purv kiya jaataa he
 saadhaaran taur par iskaa prayog pratiyogita main bhaag lene vaale skool champiens ke chayan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jisamen yah "nishpaksh nyaayakarta" ke rup main kaary karti he
saanchaa:hp4 sambhavit abhyarthiyon ke naam kagaz kii parchi main likhakar is pyaale main daal die jate hai, nishchit samay par jab jaadui agni ke fawwaare main is pyaale se naam kii ek parchi nikalati he to prayek skool se ek pratinidhi kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he
 ekbar mudi ke chhadam bhesh vaala vyakti kahata he kii gaublate of fire "ek atyadhik shaktishaalee jaadui vaastu" he or ise chakma dena bahut hi mushkil he, jab tak ki koi shaktishaalee conands charm kaa prayog na kare
 During its use in the Goblet of Fire, it is placed in the entrance hall and an "edge line" is drawn around it, a charm applied by Dumbledore to prevent younger wizards from entering the competition
 If any magician under the age of minimum enters, he will have a long white mustache, as happened to the twin Weasley brothers when they tried to dodge this cup by the aging Potion
 When it is not in use, this cup is kept in the box of jewelery adorned with beads
 gaudrik grifinder kii talwaar ek gaublin dwaara banaayi gayi talwaar he jisaki mooth par badi maniyan lagi hui he
 yah kabhi gaudrik grifinder ke adhikaar main thi, joki hallverts ke madhyayugin sansthaapakon main se ek the
 chembar of sicrates main, harry ek baslisk ko maarane ke liye sorting hat se yah talwaar nikaalata he
 yah talwaar dethale hellos main bhi ek bhoomika nibhaati he, jahaan yah prakat hota he ki is talwaar main beslisk kaa jehar vyaapt he or iskaa prayog voldemort ke teen horkraxes ko nasht karne main kiya gaya tha
 Since this sword was an imitation of the Goblin sword, it could not be destroyed, and according to Griphuk, this sword was originally created by Goblin Ragnuk and "stolen" by Gryffindor
 saatvin kitaab main belatrix lastrange kii tijori main chaape ke dauraan jab yah talwaar harry kii pakad se phisal gayi to griphuk ne is chura liya tha
 However, later on in the book, it again becomes human's hands, when Navial removes it from the sorting hat and beheaded Voldemort's snake Nagini
 isse yah spasht hota he ki, is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki kisi samay par vah hat kahaan he, lekin jab bhi grifinder house ke kisi sachche sadsy ko isaki zarurat padegi to yah punah hat main aa jaayegi
 In his webchat, Rowling confirmed that Gryffindor did not steal this sword from Ragnuk, believing it to be part of Griphook's mistrust of wizards
 philosophers stone kii pracheen rasvidya par aadhaarit, da philosophers stone nicholas flamel dwaara adhikrut ek pathar he jiskaa pehali baar zikr harry potter and da philosophers stone main kiya gaya tha
 This stone is famous for this because it turns all metals into gold and can be used to make nectar, which will become immortal for the drinker
 Philosophers Stone is mentioned only in the first book
 At the end of this book it is destroyed by Dumbledore with the consent of Flamel
 The Philosophers Stone is once again mentioned by Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when he is telling his Death Eaters what happened between his initial defeat and rebirth
 sorting hat hallverts main prayog kii jane vaali ek doordarshee kriti he, jo jaadui tareeke se yah nirdhaarit karti he ki koi bhi nayaa chaatr skool ke chaar houseej - grifinder, hafalpaf, revencla yaa sliderin- main se kis house main niyukt kiya jaayegaa

 haalanki, kabhi-kabhi, use ko yah karne kii zarurat nahin padati: udahaaran ke liye, dreko malphoy ko sar ko bina chhue hi hat ne use sliderin main bhej diya tha
 This hat was displeased in appointing Harry to the right house, Hat almost decided to send him to Slitherin when Harry pleaded with him not to do so specifically
 At this, Hat sent him to the Gryffindor in place of Slytherin, which was also his father's house
 rouling ne kaha ki harry ko kis house main bheja jaye is sambandh main hat ke anirnay kaa kaaran yah tha ki us hat ne harry ke bheetar voldemort ke ansh ko pahchaan liya tha
 The sorting hat was originally from the Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts
 At first the founders used to select the students for their respective houses, but then they thought that after his death someone else would have to do this, so Gowdrick Gryffindor took off his hat and asked him to elect the students and their This solution worked
 Since then, sorting hats have been used to select students' houses
 Due to its age it shows "speckled, clothed, and very filthy
" Every year this hat also recites an introductory song before sorting it out to the students
 The song usually warns against imminent threats, such as orders
 In the Phoenix
 Sorting Hat songs vary in content and length, but always include a brief introduction to each house
 sorting hat ne do baar grifinder kii talwaar se apane sthaan se bahaar nikalne ke liye vinati bhi kii thi, donon hi baar yah vinati saanp ko maarane ke liye kii gayi thi; chembar of sicrates main yah harry ko baslisk ko maarane ke liye yah talwaar detii he or dethale hellos main yah navial ko yahi talwaar detii he
 chembar of sicrates me dambaldor yah spasht kar dete hai ki sirf ek sachcha grifinder hi is prakaar se talwaar ko bula saktaa he
 dethale hellos main voldemort sorting hat main aag laga detaa he, haalanki aisa lagata he ki hat is aag main jali nahin thi kyonki navial iske turant baad hi isamen se grifinder kii talwaar nikaalata he or voldemort ke saanp nagini kaa sar dhad se alag kar detaa he
 dethale hellos ke ant main die gaye upsanhaar main, yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki hat ab bhi astitv main he kyonki harry apane chote bete ko bataata he ki, yadi vah sliderin house main nahin janaa chahega to hat avashya hi uski pasand ko variyata degi
 In two Harry Potter series initiatives, Hat's voice is voiced by Leslie Phillips
 Its lyrics have not been narrated in the film and the film has been shown to have a circle and burst marks at some places, indicating that the hat has "eyes" and a "mouth"
 mirar of arised ek rahasyamay darpan he jise harry ne philosophers stone main hallverts ke ek pichley galiyare main khoja tha
 It is written on it that "erised Stre Hruo Yatub Eku Ruoyt On Woh Si"
 When it is done properly in front of a mirror, it reads like this "I show not your face but your hearts desire"
 Reverting to "erised" makes it a "desire", so it is a "mirrors of Desire"
 Upon seeing this mirror, Harry sees his parents in it, as well as a group of his relatives; Ron sees himself in this mirror as the Quidditch captain with Hedby and the Quidditch Cup
 Dumbledore warns Harry that this mirror neither gives information nor the truth and people are ruined by what they see standing in front of it
 dambaldor, jo is darpan ke saamne khadey hone vaale kuch anya patron main se hai, yah bataae hai ki unhone swayan ko ek jodi mojey pakde hue dekha tha, unhone harry ko bataaya ki "kisi bhi aadmi ke paas kabhi bhi paryaapt mojey nahin hote" or unhone is baat par bhi afsos jataayaa ki unhen kabhi christmas par bhi mojey nahin mili, kyonki log hameshaa unhen kitaaben hi dena chaahate the
 haalanki, dethale hellos main yah bataaya gaya he ki vastav main dambaldor ne us darpan main apane puure parivaar ko jivit or prasann or phir ekasaath dekha, jaise ki harry ne dekha tha
 In the first book, the Mirror of Erised was the last protection given to the Philosophers' Stone
 Dumbledore hid this mirror and hid the Philosophers' Stone in it, he knew that only such a person would be able to reach here but would not know its use
 Any other person will see themselves making nectar in this glass or turning things into gold, not Philosophers looking for a stone
 order of finnics main, syrius harry ko ek darpan detaa he jiskaa prayog vastav main vah karawas ke dauraan james ke saath sampark karne ke liye karata tha
 This mirror was a part of the two-way mirror, which is activated by taking one of its two parts in the hand and taking the name of the other person who has the other part of it, when it is activated the face of the other person in this mirror i start coming in and the face of this person sitting in the mirror of the other person starts
 The mirror was given to Harry by Serius in a packet after spending his Christmas holidays at Grimmauld Place
 pehle to harry ne yah nishchay kiya ki vah ise nahin kholegaa, haalanki syrius kii mrityu ke baad usne ise dekha kintu tab yak kisi upyog laayak nahin rah gaya tha
 The second time this mirror arrives in "deathly Hallows" when Mundungus Fletcher loots Grimmauld Place and sells this mirror of Sirius to Aberforth Dumbledore, who uses it to pay attention to Harry's activities at Deathly Hallows
 When Harry becomes impatient in front of a piece of magical mirror and shouts for help, Aberforth's bright blue eyes appear, and he sends Dobby to Harry's help, who sees Harry fleeing Malfoy Manor and arriving at Shell Cottage

 Amaranthenia, also known as a love potion, attracts and seduces the drinker in a powerful way towards the drinker
 It is usually forced or given to anyone by stealing
 It is necessary to be careful in advance that the longer the potion takes effect under any circumstances, the stronger the effect, as seen in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, that Ron accidentally had a chocolate cauldron
 Eats the whole box which had a lot of love potions for Harry's love
 The medicine aroma is unique for each person who consumes it, because it smells like whatever attracts each person
 It is the most powerful aphrodisiac
 It can also be identified by its special coil lifting steam and its mother-of-pearl light

 Harry saw Snape writing something on a clipboard that might look like a void
 He then comes for the test

 iske liye use inam ke rup main felics phelisis poshan kii ek bottle di jaati he
 Drought of peace calms anxiety and reduces excitement
 In the Order of Phoenix, Snape orders Harry and his class to make it
 This potion is very difficult to make because all the ingredients have to be put in a specific order, the mixture is rotated to a certain number of times and the fire in which it is heated is given a certain time to a certain level before putting the final material
 Is slowed down
 Hannah Abbot has to forcibly drink this potion to ease her anxiety about owl's coming in Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix
 felics phelisis jise liquid lack bhi kehete hai, ise pine vaale ko asaadhaaran saubhaahgya detaa he
 iske prabhavi rahane kaa samay is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki isaki kitni maatr pi gayi he

 The paperup potion is made to relieve cough and cold, although it also has another very special side effect: steam is dripping from the patient's ear for several hours after its intake
 polizeoos poshan ise pine vaale ko ek ghante ke liye kisi bhi anya vyakti ke bhesh main aane main samarth kar detaa he
 isaki saamagree ke antargat fluxvid, notegrass, lesving makkhiyaan, liches, bicorn horn kaa churna or kaati gayi buumaslang kii twachaa aate hai
 isaki antim saamagree icchit vyakti jiskaa rup dhaaran kiya janaa he uskaa koi bhi chota sa ansh hoti he; jaise us vyakti ke bal is udddeshy ke liye aksar hi prayog kiye jate hai
 Its form and taste seem to depend on the person, for example, the cow potion made from Harry's portion was of golden color while the potion made from the closer part of the organole was gray and unsightly
 pehali baar iskaa prayog chembar of sicrates main harry or ron ko craib or goyal kaa rup dharne main sahaayta ke liye banaaya gaya tha jisase ki ve donon dreko se prashn kar saken

 baad main, harry iskaa prayog bill visli or fliyur delaakar ke vivaah ke avasar par kaalpanik "barni visli" kaa rup main dhaaran karne ke liye karata he
 harry, ron or harmion iskaa prayog ministry of magic main ghuspaith karne hetu swayan ko ministry ke karmchaariyon kaa rup dhaaran karne ke liye bhi karte hai

 Polyjous potion works well only when it is used as a human to human form, as Hermione discovers in the Chamber of Secrets that she accidentally drank a dose that contained a cat's hair
 As a result, he gets hair on his face and a cat-like tail
 This type of conversion always remains incomplete and sometimes also the opposite
 This potion only causes physical transformation of the drinker, but does not affect his dress

 There is a medicinal potion that regenerates lost / removed bones, although its taste is very poor and the process of its effect is very slow and painful
 In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry's hand breaks while playing Quidditch, and Defense Against Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart accidentally disappears all other bones instead of fixing it
 As a result, Harry has to stay in the hospital overnight with a dose of this potion
 veritaserum ko truth serum yaa truth poshan kehete hai

 People using this device see these memories from the point of view of a third person, which brings them to an omniscient view of this event
 Rowling confirmed that the memories preserved in the Pensive give anyone the opportunity to see the event with so much detail and subtlety that they can see everything in it which they no longer remember and that "this is the magic of the Pensive and The reason for its existence too "
 Preserved "memories" in the pensive are shown as silver threads
 Memories that have been manipulated or altered enough to change attitudes, or that have become foggy due to time, are thick and thick, and their view is also blocked
