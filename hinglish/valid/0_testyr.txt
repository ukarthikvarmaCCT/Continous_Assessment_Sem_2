 All the things of the Jamini mat have been absorbed into the Parashar sect, it is seen from the Parasarahora Shastra
 ★ varahamihir jaise acharya bhi parashar ke siddhanton ke saamne natmastak hai
 They adopt a very Parashar Mat in their texts
 atah parashar sampradaay sampoorn bharat main chaturdik, pushpit va pallavit hota rahaa he tathaa jyotish ke vishay main unke dwaara rachit 'brihadparashrahorashastra' antim nirnaayak granth mana jaataa he
 There is no doubt that Parashar is the pillar of 'astrology'
 ★ parashar kaa kaal mahabharat kaal ke lagbhag hona anumit he
 Being in the beginning of a period called Kali Yuga, the paramount belief of Parashar Mutt in Kali Yuga is clear from the principle of successive Ballastism

 ★ Parashara: The creation element representation corresponds to the tadic episode of Surya Siddhanta
 atah puranic kaal main aadhunik matt se panini se pehle, chanakya se bhi pehle, vaidic rachana kaal ke baad, puraana yug main, mahabharat yuddh kii ghatana ke aasapaas parashar vidyaman the
 ★ Parashar's nomenclature is found in economics
 garud puraana main parasharasmriti ke shlokon kaa sangrah kiya gaya he
 ★ In Brihadaranyakopanishad and Taittiriyaranyak, the names of Vyas and Parashar come
 ★ yask ne apane ' # nirukt' main parashar ke mul kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 He was the father of Krishnadvapayan Vyas and his father's name was 'shakti'
 varah ne parashar ko shaktiputra yaa shakti purv kaha he
 ★ In Agnipuran, he is clearly called the son of Shakti
 yahi parashar matsaygandha satyavati par mohit hue the tathaa satyavati ke garbh se parashar putr krishnadwaipayan vyas utpann hue the, yah suvidit hi he
 ★ These Parashars composed 'parasharsmriti' or 'dwadashadhyayi' Dharmasamhita to maintain order in Kali Yuga

 Dwapare Shankhwritten: Kalau Parashar: Smrita ★ krishnadwaipayan vyas ji jab kuch muniyon ko badarikashramame sthit apane pita parashar ke paas le gaye the tab parashar ne unhen varnashram dharm vyavastha parak gyaan diya tha
 ★ Varaha has also considered these Shaktiputra Parashar as the spokesperson of Horaastra
 varahamihir paanchavi sadi main hue hai, aisa mana jaataa he
 Therefore, in every situation, there is a lower limit of Parashar's time, about 2000 years ago
 ★ shrimad bhagwat main ek sthaan par vidura va maitrey kaa vaartalap ullikhit he
 It also seems to get links of # Maitreya, # Prashar and # Mahabharata

 The time tradition of Mahabharata is believed to be at least 3000 years ago

 ★ 'parashar Tantra' has been mentioned by # Bhattottapal in many places
 unhone # brihajjatak kii tikaa main 'parashari samhita' dekhne va padhane kii baat sweekaar kii he
 The quotation given by the name 'parashar Tantra', has a theme that is less than Tantra astrology and more than Samhita
 ★ bhagwaan brahma ji naarad ji se kehete hai- Lord Brahma said - o Narada! Now we say the story of the twenty-sixth incarnation of Shiva, you listen diligently
 ★ bhagwaan shiv kaa chhbbeesvaan avatar - In the twenty-sixth Dwapara, # Parashar was born Vyasa, who was our # great-grandson and was born with # Shakti

 # Parashar ★ atharvaveda ke is mantra main # parashar se prarthana kii gai he kii ve shatru ko nasht karen
 【rishi - Atharva, Deity - # Parashar, Chhanda-1 Pathyapankti, 2-3 Anushtupa】 av manyurvytav bahu manoyuja
 That is - anger and weapons should be removed
 shatruon kii bhujaaen ashakt evam man saahasaheen hon
 o deity versed in peace You can destroy the power of those enemies and provide them with their wealth
 parashar ke pita kaa naam shaktimuni tha or unki mata kaa naam adyashyanti tha
 Shaktamuni was the son of Vasishthrishi and the grandfather of Ved Vyasa
 is aadhaar par parashar vasishtha ke pautra the
 Shaktamuni was married to the daughter of the ascetic Vaishya Chitramukh, Invisible Girl
 mata ke garbh main rahete hue parashar ne pita ke munh se brahmand puraana suna tha, kaalaantar main unhone prasiddh jitendriya muni evam yudhisthir ke sabhasad jatukarnya ko uskaa upadesh kiya tha
 Parashar was a disciple of Bashkal
 rishi bashkal rugveda ke acharya the
 Yajnavalkya, Parashar, Bodhya and Agnimadhak were his disciples
 bashkal ne rugveda kii ek shakha ke chaar vibhaag karke apane in shishyon ko padhaayaa tha
 Parashar was also a disciple of Yajnavalkya
 ikshvakuvanshi ayodhya ke raja rituparan ke pautra sudas hue the
 He had a son named Veerasah, who was also called Saudas by being a son of Sudas
 maharishi vasishtha ke shaap se ve narbhoji rakshas kalmampaad hue
 The demon Roop Kalmashapad ate the hundred sons of Vasistha with power
 isse du:khaart vasishtha ne aatmahatya ke kai praytn kiye, par safal nahin hue
 So they reached the Himalayas with Shakti's wife, Invisible
 ek baar vasishthane vedadhyayan kii dhwani suni to chakit rah gayi, isliye ki veda-paath karne vaala koi vahaan dikhaai nahin de rahaa tha
 Then Avantanti told him that the son of Shakti is in my womb and the sound of his Vedhyayana has been heard
 yah sunakar vasishtha itane prasann hue ki unhone mrityu kii ichha chhod di
 After birth Parashar heard that the demon Kalmashapad had consumed his father Shakti
 yah sunate hi unke man main rakshason ke prati ghor virodh utpann hua or unhone sansar se rakshason kaa ant kar daalane kaa nishchay kiya
 With this intention, he started his demon-session in which demons were dying
 kai rakshas swaha ho gayi to niruti kii ajna paakar maharishi pulasthya parashar ke paas gayi or rakshasvansh ko bachaaye rakhane ke liye rakshas-satr purna karne kii prarthana kii
 He preached non-violence
 vyas ne bhi parashar ko samajhaayaa ki bina kisi dosha ke samast rakshason kaa sanhaar karnaa anuchit he, isliye aap apana yajna purna karen kyonki saadhuon kaa bhushan kshamaa he - Influenced by Pulastya and Vyasa's sermons, Parashar completed his demon-session
 unhone agni ko himalay ke samtal pradesh main rakh diya
 Pulastya gave him many blessings to commemorate the completion of the demon-session
 unhone bataaya ki krodh karne par bhi tum ne mere vansh kaa muloched nahin kiya
 i offer you a special groom for that
 tum puraana samhita ke rachayita banoge
 You will be able to know the deity and charitable nature as it is, and in the religious and retired religion of my offerings, your intellect will be pure and unambiguous - narmada ke uttari tat par parashar ne putr-prapti ke liye kathor tapasya kii or parvati ne pratyaksh darshan dekar unki ichha purna hone kaa aashwaasan diya
 Once Vasude, named Chediraj, came out for Mrigaya, the king, affected by the fragrant wind, beautiful atmosphere, etc
, remembered his wife and ejaculated
 use apni patni tak pahunchaane kii, raja ne ek shyen pakshi se prarthana kii
 As Shyen was taking him, he thought of it as a meat lump and grabbed another Shyen bird on the way
 tab vah veery kalindi ke jal main ja gira, jise brahma ke shaapvash machhlee ke rup main kalindi main rahati aa rahi adrika naamak apsara ne nigal liya
 As a result, a daughter and a son were born from that fish's womb
 putr kaa naam matsay padaa, jo viraat raja bana
 The daughter was named Kali and raised in a fishman
 kaali yaa matsaygandha jab kinchit badi hui, tab vah apane palit pita kii naav chalaane ke kaam main sahaayta karti thi
 An early morning Parashar came to cross the Yamuna
 dhivar kanya kaali ne hi naav kheyi
 On seeing him, Parashar Muni was enchanted and prayed for work
 doosraa koi na dekh paae, iske liye muni ne kuhase kii sristi kii or uske saath sambhog kiya, jiske falswaroop parashar-putr vyas kaa janm hua
 With the grace and blessings of Parashar, Kali's virgin remained
 parashar ke aashlesh se kaali suvaas se yukt satyavati hui
 Granted Satyavati the boon of Yojnagandha
 yahi satyavati kalantar main shantanu kii patni hui, jiske garbh se chitrangad evam vichitraveery kaa janm hua
 Vichitravirya married Kashiraj-daughter Ambika and Ambalika, but he died childless
 tab satyavati ke aagrah par ambika tathaa ambalika ke saath vyas kaa niyog hua or falswaroop pandu evam dhritarashtra kaa janm hua
 parashar-putra Vyasa divided the Vedas and called them Vedavyas
 mahabharat evam puraanon ke rachayita hone kaa shrey bhi vyas ko diya jaataa he
 Parashar also had a son named Uluq
 bhavishyapurana ke anusaar uluk kii bahan uluki kaa putr vaisheshik shakha kaa pravaktaa kanad hua
 Once Chandravanshi king Manojav was attacked by enemies and drove away with his family
 tab ve sethubandh ke sameep ek van main pahunche
 Seeing the hungry and thirsty son and wife, the king was dumbfounded
 tabhi us maarg par nikle hue parashar muni vahaan pahunche
 She convinced Queen Sumitra, mourning at her husband's wish, and touched the king with her hand
 raja hosh main aayaa
 He bowed to the sage
 tab parashar ne shatruon par vijay paane ke liye sethubandh ke mangalatirth main snaan karne kaa use upadesh diya
 The sage preached the monolithic mantra of Shriram to him
 uskaa vidhiwat jap karne par raja ke sammukh yuddh ke liye aavashyak dhanush-baan, rath, sarathi sab swayan prakat hue
 Muni Parashar anointed the king with holy water and explained the method of use of the Divas
 raja ne punah shatru par vijay paayi or apana khoyaa hua rajya praapt kiya
 Parashar met Maharaj Janak and discussed spiritualism
 ek baar raja janak ne kalyanprapti kaa upaay jaananaa chaha, to parashar ne sadachaar evam dharmanishtha kaa upadesh diya
 That is to say the statement of the mystics that Ihloka and otherworldly people become man-made by the ritualistic ritual of religion
 usase badhkar shreyaskar doosraa koi saadhan nahin he
 Parashar gave importance to Satsang
 inase pravrutt parashar gotra main gaur, nil, krishna, shwet, shyaam or dhumr chah bhed hai
 Many strains of Gaur Parashar etc
 are also found
 unke parashar, vasishtha or shakti teen pravar hai 
 Parashar has many verses in the Rigveda
 vishnupurana, parashar smriti, videhraj janak ko updisht gita jo mahabharat ke shantiparv kaa ek bhaag he, brihatparashrasanhita aadi parashar kii rachanaayen hai

 Parashar Smriti is a religiosity, with emphasis on religious piety
 kehete hai ki, ek baar rishiyon ne kaliyug yogya dharmon ko samajhane kii vyas se prarthana kii
 Vyasji thought it appropriate to ask his father Parashar regarding this
 atah ve muniyon ko lekar badarikashram main parashar ke paas gayi
 Parashar explained that in Kali Yuga, the physical strength of the people is low, so penance, knowledge-editing, yagya etc
 are not easily practicable
 isliye kalikaal main daan rup dharm kii mahatta he
 Parashar proct religion has gained special recognition in Kali Yuga
 kaha gaya he ki - That is, the religion promoted by Manu was the main in Satyayuga, Gautama had importance in Treta
 dwapar main shankh-likhit muniyon dwaara kahe gayi dharm kii pratishtha thi
 But Kalikal has a reputation for religion referred to from Parashar
 parashar muni ahimsa ko parmadhik mahatva dete hai
 In Parasharsmriti, Gomata has not only been called avadhya, but also revered
 vaise hi vanprastha evam sanyas ashramon kaa vishad varnan unke smriti granth main he
 Yoga is emphasized at the end of the book

 Shaktayana, the last phase of the Vedic period, is the author of Sanskrit grammar
 unki kritiyaan ab uplabdh nahin hai kintu yaksha, panini evam anya sanskrit vaiyakarnon ne unke vichaaron kaa sandarbh diya he
 Shaktayan's view was that all noun words are ultimately derived from some metal
 sanskrit vyakaran main yah prakriya krit-pratyay ke rup main upasthit he
 Panini accepted this view but did not make any request in this matter and also said that there are many words which have come in the lore of the people and they can not catch the metal suffix

 golakaar prithvi athwa prithvi ke kisi bade bhu-bhaag kaa samtal sataha par maanchitr banane ke liye prakaash athwa jyamitiya vidhiyon ke dwaara nirmit akshans-deshaantar rekhaon ke jaal yaa bhu-grid ko maanchitr prakshep kaha jaataa hai
 Within the cartography, the method of transferring the latitude and longitude lines of the globe to the plane plane is called map interpolation
 is prakaar khinchi hui akshansh evam deshaantar rekhaon ko "rekhajaal" kaha jaataa he
 It is not possible to move the latitude and longitude lines of the globe purely on a plane plane, because the curve plane of the globe cannot be leveled without any inaccuracy
 prakshepon ke vikaas ke praarambhik kaal main vidwaanon ne prakshepon kii aspasht vidhiyon se swarg ko pradarshit karne kii cheshtaa kii thi
 Probably the first invention of interpolation was done by Thelj sir in 600 BC
 i did
 vastav main yah cendrak khamadhya prakshep tha jise janmapatrak bhi kaha gaya
 300 BC invented real interpolation
 The first latitude line was drawn on a map drawn by Diaccius, a resident of Sicily
 prakshep ke vikaas ke itihaas main iratostheniz, tolmi tathaa macentre ke jeevankaal mahatvapurn rahe hai
 Thereafter, development and modification of projections continued continuously
 kisi bhi maanchitr athwa uske kisi bhi bhaag kii akshansh deshaantar rekhaon ko sthanantarit karne ke liye globe ko kisi vikashneey prishth se dhankkar athwa kisi samtal dharaatal ko globe ke kisi bindu par sparsh karti hui sthiti main rakhkar kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daalaa jaataa he or is prakaar akshansh deshaantar rekhaon kii chaaya prakshipt kii jaati he
 Permanent lines are drawn on this shadow itself
 taduparant vikashneey prishth ko kisi vishesh deshaantar par katkar khol diya jaataa he
 These are called geometric or perspective interpolation
 uparyukt kriya ko shishe ke athwa taar ke bane globe kii sahaayta se saraltapurvak sampann kiya jaataa he
 It is not always possible that projections are made using the above method
 bahudhaa aisi aavashyaktaa padati he ki kisi vishesh dhyey se prakshep bananaa hota he jisamen jyamitiya athwa sandarsh vidhi kii avhelnaa kerani padati he or ganit ke siddhanton evam gananaaon ke aadhaar par akshansh tathaa deshaantar rekhaayen bina kisi chaaya ko prakshipt kiye kaagaj par khinch lee jaati hai
 These are called Ajayamitiya or non-random projection
 ye adhik upyogi hote hai
 From the point of view of the map, the map has three characteristics: isosphere, normalized and pure direction
 ye teenon visheshtaayen saath saath kisi bhi prakshep par shuddh rup se praapt nahin kii ja saktin
 Each projection lacks one or the other of these features
 in visheshtaon ko shuddh rup main dhaaran karanevaale prakshepon ke naam nimnlikhit hai : Isolation Trajectories: The area of the latitudinal quadrilateral formed on the trajectory of these trajectories is proportional to the area of the congruent quadrilateral appearing on the globe, but the shape of the maps drawn on the trajectory of these trajectories is dissolved
 yathakritik prakshep : in prakshepon par khinche maanchitron kii akruti shuddh hoti he
 To keep the shape pure, the latitude and longitude lines need to be mutually perpendicular and at any one point the scale is the same in all directions
 parantu maapak ek bindu se duusare bindu par bhinn ho jaataa he
 In fact, it is not possible to keep the shape completely pure
 keval laghu kshetron main hi akruti lagbhag thik rah sakati he
 Especially at points, the full-form shape remains pure
 samaantarali prakshep : prakshepon par ankit maanchitron kii dishaaen shuddh hoti hai
 The directions around the map are the same as those on the earth
 yah centrebindu yadi koi dhruv he to deshaantar rekhaayen shuddh dishaaen pradarshit karti hai
 These interpolations are more commonly used by sailors
 vikashneey prishth ke aadhaar par kiya hua vibhaajan adhik pramanik mana jaataa he
 Under this, there are the following four groups of projections: globe ko shanku dwaara is prakaar dhankaa jaataa he ki shanku kisi ek akshansh par hi globe ko chaaron ore sparsh karata ho
 But it is not possible to touch the cone on the pole and equator, because these are odd conditions
 globe ko aavrutt karne ke uparaant kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daalkar akshansh deshaantar rekhaon kii chaaya shanku dharaatal par praapt kii jaati he
 By making these boards permanent, the cones are cut at any desired longitude and thus the line is obtained on the plane plane with the latitude lines arc and the longitude lines being the simple lines at the vertex of the cone
 jis akshansh par shanku globe ko sparsh karata he use "maanak akshansh' kehete hai
 The cone can also be touched on any other small circle
 parantu yadi shanku kaa sheersh dhruv ke dhur upar na rahe to akshansh rekhaayen chaap rup main nahin hongi or na deshaantar rekhaayen chaap rup main
 In addition to this geometric method, cone interpolations are also obtained in an unsymmetric manner
 belan dwaara globe ko is prakaar dhank diya jaataa he ki belan globe ko vishuvat rekha par chaaron ore sparsh karata ho
 Now the light line is illuminated by throwing light from a grating point
 taduparant belan ko kisi vishesh deshaantar par katkar khol liya jaataa he or is prakaar ek ytaakar rekhajaal samtal dharaatal par ban jaataa he
 Under this method, the center of the globe is considered to be the dimming point
 is prakaar praapt rekhajaal par deshaantar rekhaayen uttar se dakshin kii ore khinchi hui saral rekhaayen hoti hai jinaki lambaai vishuvat rekha ke baraabar hoti he
 In these projections, if the center of the globe is considered to be the point of divergence, then the distance between the latitude lines toward the poles increases simultaneously
 belan ko vishuvat rekha par sparsh na karte hue anya kisi vruht vrutt par bhi sparsh karaayaa ja saktaa he, parantu is prakaar khinche hue rekhajaal main akshansh ore deshaantar rekhaayen vakr hongi
 In cylindrical precipitates, the pole is not visible, because the surface of the cylinder is parallel to the pole axis and the shadow of the pole falls elsewhere and does not fall on the surface of the cylinder
 in prakshepon main samtal dharaatal par hi pratibimb liya jaataa he
 It touches the ground globe at one point and in this state a light is obtained by lighting it from a dimming point
 dhyutimaan bindu ko sthiti par aadhaarit khamadhya prakshepon ke vibhinn naam nimnlikhit hai : In the methods of mean trajectories, if the plane surface is tangent to a pole, such projections are called polar axis interpolation; if the plane plane touches the globe at some point of the equator, such projections are called equatorial termed interpolation
 iske atirikt samtal dharaatal globe ko dhruv or vishuvat rekha ke madhya sthit kisi bindu par sparsh karata he to is prakaar ke prakshep tiryak khamadhya prakshep kehalaate hai
 The projections are also named based on the above mentioned position of the dead point, such as centroid, perpendicular and oblique projection
 uparyukt vivaran se yah spasht hota he ki belanaakaar or khamadhya prakshep shanku prakshep ke hi visham rup hai
 If the cone is too long and can touch the large circle, then the cone will take the form of a cylinder
 iske atirikt shanku yadi bahut hi samtal ho jaay to globe ko keval ek bindu par hi sparsh karegaa
 At this stage, it will become silent projection
 upar likhe hue teenon samoohon ke prakshep jyamitiya evam ajyamitiya donon vidhiyon se khinche jate hai
 Ajyamitiya or non-random are interpolations, because they are drawn on the basis of the principle of mathematics and calculations without taking any reflection
 kisi vishesh uddeshy kii purti hetu hi aisa kiya jaataa he
 Although they are not easy to construct, they are used more than other types of trajectories, and these trajectories, in particular, map out the whole system
 sangeet main samay par aadhaarit ek nishchit dhaanche ko taal kaha jaataa he
 Rhythm plays an important role in classical music
 sangeet main taal dene ke liye table, mrudang, dhol or manjire aadi kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 Mridang, Ghatam etc
 are used in ancient Indian music
 aadhunik hindustani sangeet main tabalaa sarvaadhik lokapriy he
 Some of the rhythms used in Indian classical music are: Dadra, Jhapatala, Tritala, Ektala
 tantri vaadyon kii ek style taal ke vishesh chalan par aadhaarit he
 Mizraab's lyrics, taken at one and a half and half intervals in Mishrabani, use jhap-taal, Aada Char Taal and Jhumra

 shraddhaya idan shraadhm bhavarth he pret or pitttar ke nimitt, unki aatma kii tripti ke liye shraddhapurvak jo arpit kiya jaae vah shraadh he
 In Hinduism, service to parents is considered to be the greatest worship
 isliye hindu dharm shastron main pitaron kaa uddhaar karne ke liye putr kii anivaaryta maani gai hai
 Do not forget the parents who gave birth after death, so special legislation has been told to perform Shraddha
 bhadrapada poornima se asina krishnapaksh amavasya tak ke solah dinon ko pitrupaksh kehete hai jisame ham apane purvajon kii seva karte hai

 After death, phantom noun of dead person remains till Dasagatra and Shodashi-spinden
 puraanon ke anusaar vah sookshm sharir jo aatma bhautik sharir chhodane par dhaaran karti he pret hoti he
 The state of the excesses of the beloved is "phantom" because even though the soul which holds a subtle body, there is excess of attachment, illusion, hunger and thirst

 The paternity itself is obeyed by the offerings made throughout the Pitripaksha
 putr yaa uske naam se uskaa parivaar jo yav tathaa chaaval kaa pind detaa he, usamen se ansh lekar vah ambhpraan kaa rin chukaa detaa he
 Right from Ashwin Krishna Pratipada, that cycle starts to flow upward
 15 din apana-apana bhaag lekar shukla paksh kii pratipada se pitar usee brahmadia urja ke saath waapas chale jate hai
 Therefore, it is called Pitrupaksha and by doing Shraddha in this aspect, Pitras are obtained
 puraanon main kai kathaayen is uplakshya ko lekar hai jisamen karn ke punarjanm kii katha kaaphi prachlit he
 And in Hinduism, the most popular Sri Ramcharit also mentions the giving of Jalanjali to Shri Dasharatha and Jatayu on the Godavari river by Shri Rama and the mentioning of Dashagatra Vidhan for Dasharatha by Bharat ji in Bharati Kinihi Dashagatra Vidhana Tulsi Ramayana
 bhartiya dharmagranthon ke anusaar manushya par teen prakaar ke rin pramukh maane gaye hai- pitru rin, dev rin tathaa rishi rin
 Of these, ancestral debt is paramount
 pitru rin main pita ke atirikt mata tathaa ve sab bujurg bhi sammilit hai, jinhone hamen apana jivan dhaaran karne tathaa uskaa vikaas karne main sahyog diya
 In the Pitripaksha, Hindus live a life of moderation with mind and speech; Remember the fathers and add water; Donates to the poor and Brahmins
 pitrupaksh main prayek parivaar main mrit mata-pita kaa shraadh kiya jaataa he, parantu gaya shraadh kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Although its classical time is also fixed, but it has always been allowed to perform pindadan by saying 'gaya Sarvakaleshu Pind Dadadhvakshakanam'

 shastron ke anusaar pitrupaksh main apane pitaron ke nimitt jo apni shakti samarthy ke anuroop shaastra vidhi se shraddhapurvak shraadh karata he, uske sakal manorath siddh hote hai or ghar-parivaar, vyavsaay tathaa aajeevika main hameshaa unnati hoti he
 There are many reasons for Pitra dosha
 parivaar main kisi kii akaal mrityu hone se, apane mata-pita aadi sammaneey janon kaa apmaan karne se, marane ke baad mata-pita kaa uchit dhang se kriyakarm or shraadh nahin karne se, unke nimitt vaarshik shraadh aadi na karne se pitaron ko dosha lagata he
 As a result, family disturbance, family growth hindrance, accidental illness, crisis, lack of money, lack of all happiness and mindless disillusionment etc
 can cause Pitra dosha
 yadi parivaar ke kisi sadsy kii akaal mrityu hui ho to pitru dosha ke nivaaran ke liye shastreey vidhi ke anusaar uski aatm shanti ke liye kisi pavitra tirth sthaan par shraadh karavaayen
 Do not insult your parents and other elders
 prativarsh pitrupaksh main apane purvajon kaa shraadh, tarpan avashya karen
 If you do not get rid of Pitra dosha after performing all these actions, then in such a situation, get a well-qualified scholar Brahmin to narrate the story of Shrimad Bhagavat Purana
 vaise shrimad bhagwat puraana kii katha koi bhi shraddhalu purush apane pitaron kii aam shanti ke liye karvaa saktaa he
 This leads to special desired results
