 Under the guise of Hinduism or Brahminism, Rajawade has always collectively expressed the responsibilities and duties of Marathi-speaking people as Maharashtra religion and emphasized it for its advancement
 rajvaade itihaas ko keval 'iti-ha-as' arthath vah jo ghatit hua hi nahin maanate the
 He believed that history should be treated as sociology with theoretical aspects
 unka yah mat higel kii is baat se mail khaataa he ki itihaas apane sahi arthon main darshan ke rup main vyakt hota he
 Rajwade, in an essay written on Shahaji while discussing the dialectic of 'dialectis of defend', that is, to restore the power-loss of the Marathas, told that the pre-preparation of scientific knowledge for the development of the art of making perfect, shapely and fixed weapons
 Is necessary, she was not in Maharashtra at that time

 In contrast, the Rajavada welcomed the metaphysics of the seventeenth century Saint Samarth Guru Ramdas
 jinaki kavitaaon main maratha shakti kii punarsthapana kii aakanksha sametane vaali raajnneetik golbandi or marathi rashtriyata ke punarutthan kii bhavanaayen vyakt hoti thim
 Apart from this, there were thinkers long before Indian Marxists who talked about nationality and described India as a multi-national state

 Its first chapter 'stree-purush Samagam' mentioned many ancient Aryan practices
 yah pehali baar 1923 kii may main pune kii chitramyajagat patrika main prakashit hua tha
 It was stated by quotations and evidences of Veda Samhita, Mahabharata and Harivamsa that in the very ancient Arya Samaj there were physical relations between brother and sister and father and daughter
 in nirbandh shaareerik sambandhon kaa aage kis prakaar vikaas hua yahi is niabandh kaa vishay tha
 In the second chapter of this book, 'genealogical power of women and Prajapati Sanstha', he showed how to identify a child as different from the other, instead of the father was given the name of Matrikul, because then men and women would have mixed relations

 The first is that the process of establishing the Prajapati clan as separate began

 Changes began in a gradual manner in the multi-body and unitary creator institution

 In the fourth chapter 'agni and Yajna' of this book, Rajwade mentions the process of yajna, fruit-shruti and the related tales related to it, while explaining the social history of fire to explain in detail the history and tradition of Indian marriage institution
 saath hi isamen unhone stri-purush ke samuhik rup se langik samagam main ekanishtha vivaah paddati ke aitihaasik vikaas kii prakriya darshaayi he
 In this treatise, the comments written by Rajwade on the subject of the history of Indian Marriage Institution were included under the title 'lagnasastha'
 bhartiya vivaah sansthecha itihaas ke hindi sanskaran kaa moolyankan karte hue ek sameekshak ne likhaa he ki ‘hamaare punarjagran ke kai manishi dur ateet main swarnalok kii kalpana main leen the
 Rajwada was completely different from him
 bhartiya vivaah sanstha kaa itihaas main ve itihaas pariklpana ko bilkul ulat dete hai
 The conclusion of what he writes is that the Satyuga and Dwapara were in fact the era of bestial, barbaric and semiarchal rites and moral values and the great moral values on which we lay our chests are the product of Kali Yuga
 vaidic or veda-purv samaajon kaa rup kuch or hi tha, vah nahin jise ham mohavash maan baithte hai
 The antiquity will not be understood by the Rajwada, apart from the anthropology, archeology and cultural history

 At that time, many Tamil youth were angry with the policies of the Sri Lankan government, which was indifferent to the Tamils of the country

 At that time they attacked small officers, such as policemen or petty leaders

 In 1984, the LTTE took formal membership of a militant front whose other members were also Tamil militant groups - Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization, Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students, People Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam

 But in 1986 the LTTE pulled out of this front and began to establish its authority over other member organizations one by one

 In 1987, the Indian government tried to "resolve" the Sri Lankan Tamil problem after the crisis of indigenous Tamil people and the increasing number of Tamil refugees
 bhartiya vimaanon ne jafana main khaane ke packet giraae
 After this the Government of India and Sri Lanka signed an agreement
 isamen tamil ugravadiyon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha par adhikansh charampanthi sanghathanon ne is samjhaute kaa anusaran karne kaa man bana liya tha
 Under this agreement, the territories under the jurisdiction of the Northern EPRLF were granted autonomy to a certain extent and a committee was constituted consisting of Tamils of the IRPLF
 yah tay kiya gaya ki bhartiya muktvahini sena vahaan jaaegi or tamil log hathiyaar daal denge
 But the only thing left in this is that the LTTE did not like the head of the committee of representatives of the EPRLF

 As a result, the fight now broke out between the LTTE and the Indian Army

 The Indian Army started Operation Pawan with the same objective

 The word church is a corruption of the Greek adjective literally meaning "of the Lord"
 vastav main carch do arthon main prayukt he; ek to prabhu kaa bhawan arthath girjaghar tathaa doosraa, isaayiyon kaa sanghathan
 In addition to the church, the term 'congregation' also operates
 yah unani bible ke 'eklesia' shabd kaa vikrut rup he; bible main iskaa arth he - kisi sthanvishesh athwa vishwa bhar ke isaayiyon kaa samudaay
 Later this word started being used for the church as well
 yahan par sanstha ke arth main carch par vichaar kiya jaayga
 All Christians often agree that Jesus established only one church, but the unity of Christians could not remain intact for many reasons
 falswaroop aajkal unke bahut se carch athwa sanghathan vartmaan hai jo ek duusare se purnataya swatantra hai
 They can be classified as follows: isai dharm kii praarambhik shatabdiyon main carch kii paribhaasha tathaa uske swaroop ke vishay main apekshaakrit kam chintan kiya gaya he
 It is clear from the description of the biography and teachings of Jesus in the Bible that from the very beginning Christians believed that Christianity provided the means of salvation for all mankind and for this purpose established the "kingdom of God" on earth
 
 "ishwar kaa rajya" un logon kaa samudaay he jo isa ke ishwartv par vishwaas kar unki shiksha grahan karte hai
 In the Bible, that community is called "god to the people"
 uske sanghathan tathaa shashan ke liye isa ne 12 shishyon ko chunakar unhen vishesh shikshan tathaa adhikaar die or aadesh diya ki ve duniya bhar main jaakar unki shiksha kaa prachaar karen tathaa vishwaas karanevaalon ko baptism sanskaar karke carch main sammilit kar len
 Thus, in the Bible, the community of followers of Jesus is called the church, "the kingdom of God" and "the people of God"
 in padon se aisa prathit ho saktaa he ki prarambh main carch ke vaastavik rup ko bahari sanghathan tak simit mana gaya he, kintu aisi baat nahin he
 Jesus has emphasized in his teaching that there is invisible and mystical unity between him and his true followers
 unhone apane shishyon se kaha- "main draksha lata hoon or tum daaliyaan ho
 "this makes it clear that the most important element of the church is spiritual
 sant paulus ne carch ke is aadhyatmik tathaa rahasyatmak paksh par bahut bal diya he
 In his letters, he has repeatedly called the Church "the spiritual body of Christ" to illustrate the spiritual connection of Jesus and his true followers and the mysterious unity of all followers of Jesus
 at: prarambh hi se carch ke bahari sanghathan tathaa uske aadhyatmik swaroop, donaan kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 When the Church broke out due to Protestant religion, the religious people began to think more about the nature of the church
 protestant vidvan carch ke adrishy swaroop par or pratikriyaswaroop katholic dharmapandit carch ke bahari sanghathan, uski drishy sadsyta aadi par adhik bal dene lage
 In this controversy, he has given more importance to the four external characteristics of the church
 isa kaa sachcha carch katholic he ; ek he, prem ke bandhan main ek hokar uske sabhi sadsy ek se dharmasiddhanton par vishwaas karte hai
 One accepts the sacrament, the same worshiping ritual and the rule of the same goddess; Is holy; Has apposles carch ke drishy sanghathan main kuch aise log bhi sammilit ho sakate hai jo paakhandee hai, jinka isa ke saath koi aadhyatmik sambandh nahin he, jo isa ke aadhyatmik sharir ke ang nahin hai
 God only knows who is a true member of the church and for this reason it can be assumed that the real church is invisible
 phir bhi us adrishy vaastavik carch kii purna sadsyta kii anivaary shart bahari sanskaar hi hai, at: adrishy carch se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nowadays, almost all Protestants also believe this
 mukti ke liye carch kii purna sadsyta apekshit hote hue bhi anivaary nahin he
 God wants the salvation of all people and produces inspiration in the conscience of all human beings
 jo ishwar kii prerana par chalate hai ve anjaane hi adrishy rup se carch ke apurna sadsy ban jate hai or isa dwaara pradutt mukti praapt kar sakate hai
 After the Second World War, the movement for unity of the Church in the Christian world began to be given more importance
 falswaroop khandan-mandan ko chhodkar bible main vidyaman tatwon ke aadhaar par carch ke vaastavik rup ko nirdhaarit karne ke prayaas main isapar apekshaakrit adhik bal diya jane laga ki carch isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir he
 Jesus is its head and true Christians are parts of that body

 isa kii mrityu ke baad unke shishy yahudiyon tathaa gaiyr yahudiyon main isai dharm kaa prachaar karne lage
 The most successful of the first missionaries was Saint Paul; a description of his travels and his letters are preserved in the latter part of the Bible
 us samay antiok roman samrajya kaa teesraa shahar tha, is kaa uttaradhikari sant petrus yaheen chale aae or us centre se sant paulus ne asia miner, maasedonia tathaa yunaan main isai dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 Later the capital Rome became the principal center of Christianity
 vahiin sant petrus or sant paulus shahid ho gaye
 The latter half of the Bible was written in the late first century AD
 san 100 i
 tak bumadhyasaagar ke sabhi nikatavarti deshon or nagaron main, visheshkar asia miner tathaa uttar africa main isai samudaay vidyaman the
 By the end of the third century Christianity had spread to all the cities of the vast Roman Empire; At the same time many people in Persia and South Russia also became Christians
 is safalataa ke kai kaaran hai
 One, there was strong religion among the people at that time, secondly Christianity taught the importance of every human being, whether he was a slave or a woman
 iske atirikt isaayiyon main jo bhaatrubhaav tha usase log prabhavit hue bina nahin rah sake
 2
 The greatest feature of the history of the first three centuries is that at the time, the Christians were persecuted by the rulers and instead of giving up their religion in large numbers, they accepted blasphemy and death
 yadhyapi roman shaasha prarambh hi se us nae dharm ko andeh kii drushti se dekhte the or uske anuyaayiyon ko sataate the, phir bhi keval teesri shatabdi main isai dharm ko purna rup se mitaane kaa dhyaapak praytn kiya gaya tha, vishesh rup se desius, dyoklishan, muskiminian or gallarius ke shasankaal main

 The organization was as follows: In every city, the local church clergyman was called the bishop, under his rule the priest and deputy priest were engaged in religious activities
 rome, sikandriy, antiok main bishpon ko petriark kii oopaadhi di jaati thi kintu sarvatra rome ke bishap kaa vishesh adhikaar mana jaataa tha

 Early Christian literature is written primarily in the Greek language
 origen or sant ireneyas vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 Irenaeus, opposing the then misleading assumptions, declared the teaching of the Roman Church to be the test of true Christian teaching
 unhone adhiktar isai goongyaanavaad kaa khandan kiya
 Gnosticism had been going on since before Christ but later it incorporated Christian elements
 us vaad kaa moolbhoot siddhant he ki samast bhautik jagat or maanavsharir bhi dooshit he
 In one way or the other, this theory survived for centuries
 uttari africa ke nivasee teratulian latin bhashaa ke pratham vikhyath isai lekhak hai
 By the end of the second century, Christian literature in Syriac language began to be built around Edessa

 At that time unrest began to spread in the Christian world due to the belief of Arius

 The successors of Constantine favored the followers of Arius, resulting in a chaos in the East Catholic Church for nearly 50 years that the church there was never freed from the ill effects

 In 1851, Tolstoy also entered the army for some time

 The education system of this school was very progressive

 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different
 1863 se 1869 tak tollstoy kaa samay "waar and pis" kii rachana main evam 1873 se 76 tak kaa samay "anna karenina" kii rachana main beetaa

 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"

 unki dharmabhavana badi udaar or vyapak thi
 He had a clear antagonism towards the then Christianity

 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body

 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life

 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy

 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it

 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era

 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility

 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 Padmakar Kavishwar was a talented born poet
 inhen aashu-kavitt-shakti apane pehle ke kaviyon or sanskrit-vidwaanon kii sudeergh vansh-parampara se hi praapt thi
 The atmosphere of his entire family was poetic
 unke pita ke saath-saath unke kul ke anya log bhi bahut samaadrut kavi the, atah unke kul / vansh kaa naam hi ‘kavishwar’ pad gaya tha
 At the age of only 9, Padmakar started writing excellent poetry
 jaipur naresh maharaj jagat singh ko padmakar ne apana parichay kuch is tarah diya tha- Padmakar was honored with many kings as a courtly poet, so he was respected in many courts
 sudhakar pandeya ne likhaa he- "

 He acquired immense wealth and along with it always belonged to those who were immersed in court-culture
 


kaha jaataa he jab vah chalate the to raajaaon kii tarah juluus chalata tha or usamen ganikaayen tak rahati thim
 

 "in the role of 'himmat Bahadur Virudawali', Deen ji has written -" 


 Padmakar had received 56 lakh rupees in cash, 56 villages and 56 elephants from his poetic power
 

raghunatha raav ke panna or jaipur ke ranivaason main padmakar kaa pardaa na tha
 On the occasion of festivals and festivals, he had closely observed many dignitaries, who made up their royal adornments

 He praised 'himmat-bahadur-virudavali', 'pratapsingh-virudali' in honor of Jaipur Naresh Pratapsinh and 'jagat-vinod' for Sawai Jagat Singh, in honor of Daulatrao Scindia of Gwalior Alijaprakash, Jaipur In the praise of Naresh Ishwari Singh, he wrote famous poems like 'ishwar-pachisi'
 yon padmakar ji rachit granthon main sabase jane maane sangrahon main - himmatbahadur virudavalee, padmabharan, jagadvinod, ramrasayan, gangalahari, aalijaprakash, pratapsingh virudaavalee, prabodh pachaasa, ishwar-pachisi, yamunalahari, pratapsingh-safarnama, bhagavatpanchashika, raajnneeti, kali-pachisi, raysa, hitopadesh bhashaa, ashwamedh aadi pramukh hai
 Padmakar depicts a chilling portrayal of gallantry, adornment, love, devotion, courtly activities, melo-celebrations, wars, and nature-beauty through imaginative, lifelong formations
 jagah-jagah lakshanik shabdon ke prayog dwaara ve sookshm-se-sookshm bhavanubhootiyon ko sahaj hi murtiman kar dete hai
 The same vividness and pictoriality are also seen in his season

 Padmakar's language is succulent, poetic, well-organized and fluent

 Poetry-quality has been fulfilled in his verses

 Apart from Vrajbhasha, Padmakar also had a wonderful authority over Sanskrit and Prakrit - a deep research work is expected on his unpublished Sanskrit writing
 dow baba sahib ambedkar marathavada vishvavidhyalay aurangabad ke hindi / sanskrit vibhaag ne kabhi isi disha main kuch shodh-pariyojnaayen banaai thim
 It is said that he developed leprosy at the last time of his life, due to which he finally got well after the tropical use of Ganga water

 The objects that appear in the sky sometimes moving from one side to another or falling on the earth are called 'breaking stars' or 'luka' in meteor and common colloquium
 ulkaon kaa jo ansh vayumandal main jalane se bachakar prithvi tak pahunchataa he use ulkapind kehete hai
 Meteors can be seen in countless numbers each night, but the number of bodies that fall on the earth is very small
 vaigyanik drushti se inkaa mahatv bahut adhik he kyonki ek to ye ati durlabh hote hai, duusare akaash main vichrate hue vibhinn grahon ityadi ke sanghathan or sanrachana ke gyaan ke pratyaksh strot keval ye hi pind hai
 By studying them, we also get a sense of what are the reactions on the matter coming from the sky in the global environment
 is prakaar ye pind brahmandavidya or bhuvigyaan ke bich sampark sthapit karte hai
 Although man was familiar with these falling stars from very ancient times, in the development of modern science, it took a long time for man to believe that these bodies found on the ground came from the sky on earth
 18veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main di
 trauyali naamak darshanik ne italy main albareto sthaan par gire hue ulkapind kaa varnan karte hue yah vichaar prakat kiya ki vah khamandal se tuutate hue taare ke rup main aayaa hoga, kintu kisi ne bhi isapar dhyaan nahin diya
 In 1768, Father Basile automatically saw a meteorite coming to Earth at a place called Luce in France
 agle varsh usne paris kii vigyaan kii royal academi ke adhiveshan main is vrittant par ek lekh padhaa
 Not believing the account, the Academy appointed a commission to investigate the incident, reporting that Father Basile's account was misleading, stating that the body of the body had become somewhat glassy due to lightning
 This led to the confusion of Basile that these bodies are not part of the earth
 tadnantar german darshanik cladni ne san 1794 i
 main siberia se praapt ek ulkapind kaa adhyayan karte hue yah siddhant prastaavit kiya ki ye pind khamandal ke pratinidhi hote hai
 Although this idea was not immediately accepted even this time, Claudney received the credit for drawing attention to this topic and since then scientists began to give more attention to the subject
 san 1803 i
 main france main laa agil sthaan par ulkapindon kii ek bahut badi vrishti hui jisamen anginat chote-bade pathar gire or unamem se praaia: do-teen hajaar ikatthe bhi kiye ja sake
 The French Academy of Sciences thoroughly researched the rain, and in the end no one suspected that meteorites actually came to Earth from the mantle
 ulkapindon kaa mukhya vargeekaran unke sanghathan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Some bodies are mostly made of iron, nickel or alloys and some resemble stones made of silicate minerals
 pehle vargvaalon ko dhatvik or duusare vargvaalon ko aashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In addition, metallic and surprising substances are often found in the same quantity in some bodies, they are called metallic meteorites
 vastut: purnataya dhatvik or purnataya aashmik ulkpindon ke bich sabhi prakaar kii ant:sth jatiyon ke ulkapind paae jate hai jisase pindon ke varg kaa nirnay karnaa bahudhaa kathin ho jaataa he
 Depending on the structure, strains are made in all three classes
 aashmik pindon main do mukhya upbhed hai jinamein se ek ko kaundrite or duusare ko akundrite kehete hai
 The main feature of the first subclass is that some specific circular grains, called caudreule, are present in them
 jin pindon main kaundrul upasthit nahin rahete unhen akundrite kehete hai
 There are also two main strains in metallic meteorites which are called Ashtaniq and Shasthanik respectively
 ye naam pindon kii antarrachana vyakt karte hai or jaisaa in naamon se vyakt hota he, pehle vibhed ke pindon main dhatvik padaarth ke bandha ashtani aakaar main or duusare main shashthinik aakaar main vinyast hote hai
 This type of composition is called Vidmanstetter and it can be identified with great ease on the leaf page of the body
 dhatvashmik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upvarg hai jinhen krmanusaar pelesite or ardhdhathwik kehete hai
 The surprising part of the first subclass of these bodies is mainly made up of olivine minerals, which are often circular and are incorporated into a system of ferrous-nickel metals
 ardhdhathwik ulkapindon main mukhyat: piroxin or alp maatra main anaurthite felsapaar vidyaman hote hai
 It has been mentioned in the earlier case that meteorites are classified based on the primacy of metallic and astral organs
 kintu in pindon main rasinic tatwon or khanijon ke vitaran ke sambandh main koi sunishchit aadhaar prathit nahin hota
 Apart from the three main classes of meteorites, there are several subclasses, each with its own distinct mineral community
 abhi tak praaia: 25 nae virgon kaa pataa laga he or praaia: prati do varsh ek nae upvarg kaa pataa lagata rahaa he
 The difficulty is that the materials available for study are very small
 abhi tak ulkapindon main keval 52 rasinic tatwon kii upasthiti pramanit hui he jinke naam nimnlikhit hai: 
 oxigen

 iron

 helium Of these 52 elements, only eight are found in abundance, of which Hall is the most prominent
 anya saat main krmanusaar oxijan, silicon, manganisheium, gandhak, aluminium, nikal or calcium hai
 In addition to these, 20 other elements are found in sufficient quantity and their presence was detected before 1926 by simple chemical analysis
 shesh 24 tatv atyant alp maatra main vidyaman hai evam unki upasthiti varnakramadarshaki vishleshan se siddh kii gai he
 From the point of view of mineral composition there are many differences in the characteristics of meteorites and rocks found in the earth
 saadharantaya bhumandaleey shail raashiyon main swatantra dhaatu rup main loha tathaa nikal atyant durlabh hote hai, kintu ulkapindon main dhaatuen shuddh rup main bahut prachurtaa se tathaa praaia: anivaaryat: pai jaati hai
 In addition, there are many minerals that are not found in terrestrial rocks, but are found in meteorites
 inamen se pramukh oldemite or shribersite hai
 Both these minerals are not permanent in abundance of moisture and oxygen and hence are not found in global rocks
 inaki upasthiti se yah bodh hota he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti aise vaataavaran main hui jahaan bhumandal kii apeksha oxidikaran kii paristhitiyaan nune rahi hongi
 Astounding meteorites generally lack the abundance of pyroxene and olivine and lack of feldspar, making their organization similar to the superfamous rocks of the planet
 ulkapindon kii utpatti kaa vishay bahut hi vivaadaaspad he
 Several views have been proposed on this subject from time to time, in some of which they have been considered as part of Earth, Moon, Sun and Comet etc
 ek ati maanya mat ke anusaar inaki utpatti ek aise grah se hui jo ab purnataya vinasht ho gaya he
 In this view, it is imagined that in the beginning, there must have been a planet in the shape of Mars which was destroyed when it came very close to another big planet, or collided with another planet, due to which billions of small number Large blocks formed which are visible in meteorite form
 is mat ke anusaar dhatvik ulka us kalpit grah kaa kendriya bhaag tathaa aashmik ulka upree prishth nirupit karte hai
 Although this metaphor explains many symptoms of meteorites, many things remain an incomprehensible puzzle
 udaahranarth kuch dhatvik ulkapindon main ashtani rachana hoti he jo saadharantaya 800 degree centegrade taap par nasht ho jaati he
 It is believed that during the fission of that fictitious planet, there must have been more heat in it
 phir bhi yah samaj main nahin aata ki yah ashtani rachana vinasht hone se kaise bachi
 Similarly, there is also doubt as to where the iron came from in the Akundrite Awesome Meteor and how Kaunduyul was formed in the Kondrite Awesome Meteor
 ek anya mat main yah prastaavit kiya gaya he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti grahon ke saath saath ho hui, athwa yon kahana chahie ki soramandal evam samast khamandaleey padaartho kii utpatti ulkapindon se hi hui
 According to this fantasy, the primordial world was full of meteorites and in time, those bodies gathered in different masses and according to their maximum density, gasamic noharica, constellations and planets were born
 is kalpana kii ek badi truti yah prathit hoti he ki khamandal main upasthit ulkapind itani dur-dur chhitaraaye hue hai tathaa unka parsparik aakarshan itnaa ksheen he ki unke ekatra hokar badi raashi banane main atyadhik samay lagegaa
 But there is no doubt that once a sufficiently large amount of money is formed, it will be able to retain its power and will eventually increase its size by adding more bodies
 sambhav he, uparyukt vidhiyon main anshat: sanshodhan karne se inaki utpatti kii vaastavik vidhi nirdhaarit ho sake
 a large collection of meteorites is on display in the Geological Department of the Indian Museum of Calcutta
 isaki dekharekh bhartiya bhuvaigyanik surveykshan sanstha ke nirikshan main hoti he
 According to the prevailing rules, meteorites dropped anywhere in the country are government property
 jis kisi ko aisa pind mili uskaa kartavya he ki vah use sthaneey jiladhish ke paas pahunchaa de jahaan se vah bhartiya bhuvaigyanik surveykshan vibhaag ko bhej diya jaataa he
 Thus gradually this collection has become unique in its way
 iske atirikt is sangrah main videshon se bhi praapt namoonay rakhe gaye hai
 This collection is the largest in Asia and its position is very high in other collections of the world, because one has many different specimens in it and the other many specimens are of very rare species
 sab milakar isamen 468 vibhinn ulkapaat nirupit hai, jinamein se 149 dhatvik or 319 aashmik varg ke hai
 The largest Indian wondrous meteorite of this museum was obtained from Medua place in Allahabad district
 vah 30 agast 1920 ko praat: 11 bajkar 15 minute par giri tha
 Its weight is usually 56,657 grams and the longest length is 12 inches
 doosraa sthaan us pind kaa he jo malabar main kuttipuram gram main 6 april 1914 ko praat: kaal 7 baje gira tha
 Its weight is 38,437 grams

 The communication medium is the medium used in the flow of messages
 sanchaar madhyamon ke vikaas ke peeche mukhya kaaran maanav kii jigyaasu pravriti kaa hona he
 At present, there is a deep connection and closeness in the media and society
 iske dwaara jan saamaanya kii ruchi evam hiton ko spasht kiya jaataa he
 Communication is the only way to make information accessible
 takneekee vikaas se sanchaar madhyam bhi viksit hue hai tathaa isse sanchaar ab global phenomeno ban gaya he
 The communication medium is made up of "media" in English, which means connecting two points
 sanchaar madhyam hi sampreshak or shrota ko paraspar jodate hai
 According to Harald Loswell, the main functions of the media are information collection and dissemination, information analysis, communicating social values and knowledge and entertaining people
 sanchaar madhyam kaa prabhaav samaaj main anadikaal se hi rahaa he
 Traditional and modern media are connected with the development process of the society itself
 sanchaar madhyam kaa shrota athwa lakshya samooh bikharaa hota he
 Its messages are also volatile
 phir sanchaar madhyam hi sanchaar prakriya ko anjaam tak pahunchaate hai
 The word communication is the Hindi version of communication in English, which is derived from the Latin word communis, which means information with common participation
 chunki sanchaar samaaj main hi ghatit hota he, at: ham samaaj ke pariprekshya se dekhen to pate hai ki saamaajik sambandhon ko disha dene athwa nirantar pravaahman banaae rakhane kii prakriya hi sanchaar he
 Communication is associated with the development of society from the beginning to the present
 prasiddh sanchaarvetta denis maquel ke anusaar, " ek vyakti se duusare vyakti tak arthpurna sandeshon kaa aadan pradaan he
 In Dr
 Mary's view, "communication is the harmony of social tools
 " In Legance's words, "is a continuous process
 yah prakriya nirantar antakriya se chalati rahati he or isamen anubhavon kii saajhedaari hoti he
 " raajnneeti shaastra vichaarak lukiv pai ke vichaar main, " saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan hi sanchaar he
 " is prakaar sanchaar ke sambandh main kah sakate hai ki isamen samaaj mukhya kendra hota he jahaan sanchaar kii prakriya ghatit hoti he
 The process of communication cannot be tied to any scope
 phir sanchaar kaa lakshya hi hota he- suchanaatmak, preranaatmak, shikshatmak va manoranjanatmak
 Media has existed in India since ancient times
 yah alag baat he ki unka rup alag-alag hota tha
 Communication theory in India is associated with poetry tradition
 saadhaarikaran or sthayibhav sanchaar siddhanth se hi jude hue hai
 Communication mainly depends on the nature of the message
 phir jahaan tak sanchaar madhyamon kii prakruti kaa sawaal he to vah sanchaar ke upyogkarta ke saath-saath samaaj se bhi judaa hota he
 Since we also find that the medium of communication stimulates the processes within the society
 nivartmaan shatabdi main bharat ke sanchaar madhyamon kii prakruti va charitra main badlaav bhi hue hai lekin press ke charitra main mukhyat: teen-chaar gunatmak parivartan dikhaai dete hai- First: In the first half of the century, its character was basically missionary, the reason was freedom from freedom movement and colonial rule
 iske charitra ke nirmaan main tilak, gandhi, maakhanlaal chaturvedi, vishnu paradkar, madhavrao sapre jaise vyaktitv ne yogadan kiya tha
 Second: After 15 August 1947, new priorities emerge on the nation's agenda
 yahan se raashtra nirmaan kaal aarambh hua or press bhi iske sanskaron se prabhavit hua
 This phase lasted for two decades
 teesraa : saatven dashak se vishuddh vyavsaayikta kii samskruti aarambh hui
 The reason was the explosion of political ambitions
 chauthaa : antim do dashakon main press kaa aadhunikeekaran hua, kshetreey press kaa ek `shakti` ke rup main ubharna or patr-patrikaon se samvedansheeltaa evam drushti kaa vilupt hona
 Apart from this, the nature of media is temporary today
 iske apane vaazib kaaran bhi hai haalanki iske alaava anya makasad se bhi sanchaar madhyam betuki khabaren va suchanaaen sansanikhej tareeke se parosane lage hai
 Simgadi is a village in Bageshwar district of Kumaon division under Uttarakhand state of India in Kanda tehsil

 a dometer or galvanometer is a type of ammeter
 yah kisi paripath main dhara kii upasthiti kaa pataa karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Often ampere, volt or ohm marks are not placed on it
 Current senstivity-cs-nab \ ksi unit of current senstivity is Radian / Ampiar There can be many types of photometer sparshajya dharamapi sabase saral or upyogi chalchumbak dharamapi he
 There is a circular coil of insulating copper wire on the vertical structure of an non-magnetic material
 kundali main praaia: 552 chakkar hote hai, jisamen 2, 50 or 500 chakkaron ke baad sanyojak pench lage rahete hai
 With their help, you can work with fewer or more rounds as needed
 vrittakar kundali ko urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore ghumaya ja saktaa he
 a magnetic needle rests on the vertical rivet at the center of the coil and a long indicator of aluminum perpendicular to the needle, which rotates along the needle on a horizontal circular scale and deflects the magnetic needle
 yah scale chaar chaturthaanshon main vibhajit rahata he or prayek chaturthaansh main 0 degree se 90 degree tak ke chihn hote hai
 When the magnetic needle is in the magnetic meridian, the indicator remains at zero degree
 dhara naapane ke purv dharamapi ke aadhaar ko kshaitij kar lete hai or kundali ke samtal ko ghumaakar chumbakeey yamyottar main le aate hai
 In this case, the magnetic needle boxes are positioned in a depressed position at the center of the coil and also see that both ends of the indicator are located at 0 ° - 0 °
 Now connect the two connective screws of the dielectric to the circuit
 In which the current flows
 urdhwadhar kundali main dhara ke pravaahit hote hi, ek chumbakeey kshetra utpann ho jaataa he, jo parthiv kshaitij chumbakeey kshetra se samakon banaata he
 Due to both of those magnetic fields, two opposing forces on the magnetic needle work
 sooyee vikshepit hokar aisi dasha main ruk jaati he jahaan donon balyugmon kaa ghurna baraabar hota he
 If the needle deflection is Q, the current value is determined by the following formula: arthath dharamapi main bahanevaali dhara vikshep kone ke sparshajya ke samaanupati hoti he
 The change of constant dielectric is called multiplier
 parivartan gunak ampiore main napa jaati he
 This is equivalent to an electric current that can produce a 45 degree deflection in the needle of a dielectric
 is prakaar kaa saral sparshajya dharamapi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi or yatharth nahin hota
 Particularly due to the current, the intensity of the magnetic field is not the same at both poles of the magnetic needle
 is kaaran dharaman main truti ho jaati he, kyonki sutara isi par nirbhar he ki donon dhruvon par chumbakeey kshetra ek sa ho
 Therefore, based on this principle, a second thermometer was called, Helmholts galvanometer
 is dharamapi main yah truti nahin hoti or yah saral sparshajya dharamapi se adhik sookshmagrahi hota he
 It consists of circular coils on two vertical structures of non-magnetic material
 unke kendron ke bich kii duuri unke ardhavyas ke baraabar hoti he
 The magnetic needle box is placed exactly on the horizontal axis of both the coils
 donon kundaliyon ke taar is prakaar jod die jate hai ki jab unamem dhara pravaahit ho tab donon se utpann chumbakeey kshetra ek hi disha main hon
 In this case, the magnetic field produced by the ground near the magnetic needle becomes more intense and it can also be proved that the intensity of this field remains the same at both ends of the needle
 is parivartan ke falswaroop yah dharamapi adhik sookshmagrahi or yatharth ho jaataa he
 Before measuring the current, it is necessary to horizontal the plane of the needle box and the vertical coils in the magnetic meridian
 is samanjan ke baad jab dharamapi kii kundaliyon main dhara pravaahit kii jaati he or chumbakeey sooyee main kone kaa vikshep hota he, tab dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : g is called the change multiplier of Helmholt's photometer
 yah dharamapi bhi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi nahin hota
 a new theory is used to make more sensitive perforators
 vah yah he ki yadi parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav chumbakeey sooyee par kam kar diya jaae, to kisi bhi dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee main pehle se adhik vikshep hoga, arthath yantra adhik sookshmagrahi ho jayega
 This is called the principle of inertial pairing
 yadi do lagbhag baraabar chumbakeey ghurna vaale chumbakon ko ek drudh chad se aisa joda jaae ki ve ek duusare ke samaantar hon or unke vipareet dhruv paas paas hon, to unhen asthaitik yugma kehete hai
 In this pair, opposite poles of both magnets are close by, hence the effect of earth magnetic field has little effect on this pair
 taar kii kundali yaa kundaliyaan ek chumbak yaa donon chumbak ke chaaron ore is prakaar lapeti jaati hai ki unamem dhara bahane par chumbakon par ek hi disha main balyugma lage
 In this case if there is also a low current in the coil, there is more deflection in the magnetic pair
 is prakaar ke dharamapi ati sookshmagrahi hote hai
 If this magnetic pair is hung by a spindleless pendant and a small mirror is attached to this pendant, a very small deflection can be measured by the light beam
 prakaash kii kirane lamp se chalakar dharamapi ke darpan se paravartit hokar ek lens dwaara scale par focus main aati hai
 When there is a deflection in the magnetic pair due to current flow and the mirror rotates by angle Q, the reflected light rays rotate at angle 2Q and transfer to the lightpoint on the scale
 is vidhi se sooyee kaa ati sookshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he or iske falswaroop is dharamapi se ati sookshm dhara naapi ja sakati he
 The inertial magnetic pair has been used in many different types of currents
 kelvin dharamapi, pashen dharamapi or broka dharamapi inke kuch udhaaharan hai
 a current of 10-12 amperes can be measured from these currents
 jalchumbak dharamapi, vishesh kar asthaitik dharamapi, atyam sookshmagrahi hote hai, parantu inkaa prayog asuvidhajanak hota he
 They are also temporary
 yahi kaaran he ki ve bahut kam prayukt hote hai
 Most chalkandi dharampati is used, as they are permanent, simple and convenient in addition to being sufficiently sensitive
