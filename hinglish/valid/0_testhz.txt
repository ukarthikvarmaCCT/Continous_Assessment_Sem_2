 Chandragupta Vikramaditya King of Gupta Dynasty
 chandragupta dwitiya mahaan jinako sanskrit main vikramaditya yaa chandragupta vikramaditya ke naam se janaa jaataa he; gupt vansh ke ek mahaan shaktishaalee samraat the
 His kingdom lasted till 380-412 AD in which the Gupta dynasty attained its peak
 gupt samrajya kaa vah samay bharat kaa svarnim yug bhi kaha jaataa he
 Chandragupta II the Great was the son of his former king Samudragupta the Great
 usne aakraamak vistaar kii niti evam laabhdayak parigrahan niti kaa anusaar karke safalataa praapt kii
 Chandragupta II It is clear from Vikramaditya Samudragupta's epigraphy that many of his sons were grandchildren, but in his last time he appointed Chandragupta as his successor
 chandragupta dwitiya evam parvarti guptasamraaton ke abhilekhon se bhi yahi dhvanit hota he ki samudragupta kii mrityu ke uparaant chandragupta dwitiya hi guptasamrat hue
 But on the contrary, some scholars certify Ramgupta as the successor of Samudragupta on the basis of 'devi Chandragupta' and some other literary and archaeological inscriptions available in part
 ramgupta kii ayogyata kaa laabh uthaakar chandragupta ne uske rajya evam rani donon kaa haran kar liya
 The historicity of Ramgupta is doubtful
 bhilsa aadi se praapt tamra sikkon kaa ramgupta us pradesh kaa koi sthaneey shaasha hi rahaa hoga
 The date of Chandragupta II is determined based on his inscriptions etc
 chandragupta kaa, guptasanwat 61 main utkeern mathura stambhalekh, unke rajya ke paanchaven varsh main likhaaya gaya tha
 As a result, he ascended the Guptas in 61-5 = 56 = 375 AD
 chandragupta dwitiya kii antim gyaat tithi unki rajathamudraon par praapt haati he- guptasanwat 90+ 0= 409- 410 i

 From this one can infer that Chandragupta was probably ruling for the above mentioned year
 iske vipareet kumargupta pratham kii pratham gyaat tithi guptasanwat 96= 415 i
, unke bilsand abhilekh se praapt hoti he
 On this basis, it is estimated that the reign of Chandragupta II may have ended in 413â€“14 AD

 Records and Mudra inscriptions give knowledge of his various titles - Maharajadhiraja, Parambhagavat, Srivikram, Narendrachandra, Narendra Singh, Vikramank and Vikramaditya etc

 chandragupta ke sandhivigrahik virasen shaab ke udaygiri guhaalekh se, unka samast prithvi jatine ke uddeshy se vahaan tak aana spasht he
 His long-standing presence in the Malava region is evident from the writings of the Gupta Samvat 82 of the feudatory ruler of Chandragupta, Sanakaniq Maharaj, and the Sanchi Gupta Samvat 93 of a magistrate named Amarkardava, obtained from this place
 sambhavat: chandragupta dwitiya ne shaq rudrasingh tritiy ke viruddh yusanchalan tathaa vijayoparant saurashtra ke shashan ko yaheen se vyavasthit kiya ho

 Chandragupta's army chief Amarkardava, in his Sanchi inscription, calls himself, many Samaravaptavijayyasupatakas
 in anek samaron ke ullekh se yah bhi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki chandragupta ne shakayuddh ke atirikt anya yuddh bhi kiye honge
 But in the present situation his discussion is unproven

 Chandra has been identified with various emperors of ancient India
 kintu praaia: vidvan unki pahchaan chandragupta dwitiya se karte hai
 If this theory is believed to be correct, then it will not be said that the second Chandragupta defeated the enemies who came in the organization of Vanga region and crossed the seven faces of the Indus and won the Vahlikas
 vang ko pahchaan saadharantaya purvi bengal tathaa bahli kii balkh se kii jaati hai, yadhyapi kuch aashcharya nahin jo vahlikon kii nivas pashchimi pakistan main hi kahin rahaa ho

 Only after the victory of Ujjayini would Malav Samvat be associated with the name of Vikramaditya and started being named as vikram-samvat

 Ernest Rutherford was a famous chemist and physicist
 unhen nabhikeey bhautikee kaa janak mana jaataa he
 Ernest Rutherford was born on 30 August 1871 in New Zealand
 apni adhiktam umr rasinic prayogon main gujaarne vaale vaigyanik maaikel farade ke baad duusare sthaan par arnest radarford kaa hi naam aata he
 Due to his qualifications in physics, in 1894, Rutherford got a chance to do research under the famous physicist Sir JJ Thomson, for which he got a scholarship
 1898 main canada ke macgil vishvavidhyalay main ve bhautikee ke professor rahe or 1907 main england mancastor vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee ke vyaakhyaata
 After Thomson's death in 1919, Ernest Rutherford became Professor and Director of Physics at Cambridge University
 bhautik rasayan ke lagbhag sabhi prayogon main upyog hone vaali alpha, beta or gamma kirnon ke bich antar bataane vaale vaigyanik arnest radarford hi the
 He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his contributions to nuclear physics
 arnest radarford ke parmaanu sanrachana ke siddhant se pehle padaarthon main parmaanu kii upasthiti kaa pataa to chal sakaa tha, kintu parmaanu ke bare main jo jaankaree thi use aage gati di arnest radarford ke kiye prayongon ne
 Years ago, Maharishi Kanad had told that every substance is made up of very small particles
 1808 main britain ke bhautik vigyaani jon dalton ne apane prayogon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki padaarth jin avibhajya kanon se milakar bana he unhen parmaanu kehete hai
 Independent existence of these atoms is possible
 dalton ke baad vaigyanik thomson va radarford ke prayogon ne dalton ke siddhant main sudhaar kiya unhone spasht kar diya ki parmaanu avibhajya nahin he balki yah choteâˆ’chote aaweshit kanon se milakar bana he
 In 1897, Sir Thomson proved the presence of a positively charged particle inside the atom
 us samay tak parmaanu ke andar upasthit dhanaveshit kanon ke liye kaha gaya tha ki ye kan parmaanu ke andar bikhri hui avasthaa main thik usee rahete hai jaise bundi ke laddu main ilaychi ke dane athwa water mailan ke andar uske beej yaa christmas pudding main dry fruits
 Ernest Rutherford's scientific mind was not satisfied with such an interpretation of the electron inside the atom, he carried out many more experiments to the satisfaction
 parmaanu ke andar kii ko sanrachana jaanane ke liye 1911 main unhone ek prayog kiya jisamen unhone nirvaat main screen ke saamne rakhi ek patali swarna panni main se kuch alpha kirnon ko guzaara
 The results of the experiment were surprising
 parmaanu ke bare main ab tak prachlit siddhanth ke anusaar alpha kanon ko gold foil ke paar screen par ek hi jagah jaakar takaraana chahie tha, kintu radarford ne dekha ki kuch alpha kan gold foil se takaraakar bhinnâˆ’bhinn konon par vichlit hokar waapas aa rahe the or kuch uske paar bhi nikal rahe the
 Rutherford's experiment made it clear that there is some dense positive part between the atoms from which the alpha particles were returning
 prayog se unhone siddh kiya ki yah dhanatmak ghanaa bhaag parmaanu kaa 'nabhik' he, is nabhik main hi parmaanu kaa samast dravyaman kendrit rahata he evam electron isi dhanatmak aavesh ke chaaron or vyavasthit rup se ghoomte hai

 def lepard kaa pehla elbum, on thru da nit, 14 march 1980 ko jari kiya gaya tha
 Although the album was in the UK at peak 15, many early fans were disappointed to think that the band was trying too much to attract American listeners by singing the song "hello America" and more
 agast main reeding festival main ek pradarshan bighad gaya tha jab darshakon ne apni naaraazgi band par kooda-karkat phenk kar abhivyakt kii thi
 The band was then noticed by AC / DC producer Robert Joan "mat" Leng, who agreed to work on their second album, High 'n' Dry, which was released on 11 July 1981
 Leng's subtle approach in the studio helped him to begin defining his voice
 Despite the album's ineffective sales, "bringin 'on The Heartbreak" promo clipping became the first metal video to be played on MTV in 1982, bringing the band's growing popularity to the States
 Following the release of the album, a European tour followed

 is dharti ke patte kii chaudaai uttar se dakshin tak lagbhag 1,600 kimi thi yani iskaa kshetrafal kaafii bada tha
 During the last ice age, the sea level was below today due to the accumulation of a lot of sea water in the form of ice, due to which Berinjia was a land area
 himyug samaapt hone par bahut si yah barf pighali, samudr-tal uthaa or beringia samudr ke neeche dub gaya
 When Berinjia existed, snowfall was less here due to the favorable regional climate and the atmosphere was like the steppes in Central Asia
 itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki us samay kuch maanav samooh asia se aakar yahan bas gaye
 He could not enter North America further than Berinjia because the great glaciers were blocking his path
 iske baad beringia or asia ke bich bhi ek barf kii diwaar khadi hone se beringia par chand hazaar maanav lagbhag 5,000 saalon tak anya maanvon se bina sampark ke himyug ke bhayankar prakope se bache rahe
 About 16,500 years ago, Himanias started melting and they entered North America
 lagbhag usee samay ke aasapaas beringia bhi pani main doobane laga or aaj se qareeb 6,000 varsh pehle tak taton ke rup vaise ho gaye jaise ki aadhunik yug main dekhe jate hai
 Berinjia was about 4,000 km long and 1,600 km wide
 yah aadhunik siberia kii lenaa nadi se lekar canada kii maikenzi nadi tak pahunchataa tha
 Its area was so large that according to some geologists it was less of a ground bridge and more of a subcontinent
 maimathon ke avasheshon kii haddiyon main maujuud colejan par anusandhan karke vaigyanikon ne yah mat diya he ki pashchimi beringia purvi beringia se zayaada shushk or thanda tha or isliye purvi beringia main praaniyon or paudhon kii adhik samruddhi or vividhta thi
 Berinjia was a large area and most of it was free from Himanias and many animals lived on its steppe-like area
 isliye kuch hazaar maanav bhi yahan rah paae
 It is believed that it lived in Berinjia for 5â€“17 thousand years and had no contact with other human societies
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa sochna he ki ek jamaane main beringian maanvon kii pashanyugiya samskruti puure beringia main purv main siberia ke premorye kshetra se lekar pashchim main alaska tak or dakshin main hokkaido tak faili hui thi
 No remains of Berinjians have been found as this entire subcontinent is now submerged under the ocean
 in beringian logon kaa jivan yaqinan kathin tha kyonki yah ek atyant sard ilaaka tha
 It lived a hunter-gatherer biography and would live on average less than 40 years old
 garmiyon main badi taadaad main machhar or anya keet unhen pareshaan karte honge, jaisaa ki siberia main bhi dekha jaataa he
 When the weather changed and their terrain sank, the Berinjians were forced to migrate to North America, they would have had to learn to live afresh in America's separate ab-o-hawa
 2005 main hue ek anuvaanshiki anusandhan se sanket miltaa he ki shaayad 80 se bhi kam beringiaayiyon kaa vansh aadhunik kaal tak chal paaya he, yani anya sabhi kisi-na-kisi musiibat main padakar bina aage vansh chalaae hi khatm ho gaye
 Animals such as camel, mammoth, American lion, horse, deer, sheep, wolf and steppe buffalo were inhabited on Berinjia
 uttar america main hathi, baldaar ganda or singh ab vilupt hai lekin ve isi jamini pul ke zariye asia se vahaan pahunche
 It is also known from the study that the camel origin actually started in North America and the camel passed through Berinjia and reached other parts of Asia and the world
 itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki beringia main maimath jaise bhimkaay jaanwaron ke bich rahakar beringian maanav unke shikaar main maahir ho gaye the
 Later, when it spread to Alaska and other parts of North America, there he continued to hunt these large animals on a large scale with his mastery

 Usually an algorithm is first presented as a flow table and then a program is prepared in the appropriate computer language based on the flow table
 elgoridm ko abhivyakt karne ke anya tareeke: The main advantage of preparing the algorithm and flow table of a program is that the programmer currently orders the instructions of the program only according to the process of completion of the work and the logic and conditions used in it, it is used in the programming language
 Does not consider elements
 program me taarkik truti evam sharto ke puraa na hone kii sthiti elgoritham evam pravaah talika adhik spasht ho jaati he
 Once a flow table is created, the programmer not only focuses on the arguments and the conditions, but only in the programming language as a statement of the various actions given in the various boxes used in the flow table
