 If any non-muslim wants to enter the mosque, the same thing applies to them
 islam main tahaarat bahut mahatv he
 According to a hadith, the Taharat is half faith
 isliye masjid main aane ke liye paak or saaf hona shart he, lekin vuzu aap masjid main aakar kar sakate hai
 Muslims often stay in mosques in Maktab concern
 It is not lawful to stay in the family
 It is also not permissible to enter such a situation in Masjid Haram and Masjid Nabvi

 musalmaan masjid ko allaah kaa ghar samajhate hai chaahe uskaa sambandh musalamaanon ke kisi bhi samudaay se ho
 The silence and culture and poetry in the mosque are insisted that the namaz and the Quran are not disturbed
 masjidon main ladaai jhagada yaa bina jarurat daniyavi baton se bachanaa chahie haalanki samuhik maamalon par charchaa kii ja sakati he
 Running in a mosque or stepping up and talking loudly is against culture and poetry
 isi tarah koi bhi aisa kaam karnaa jisase prarthana tang hoon, acha nahin samajha jaataa, jaise pyaaj, lahasun, muuli yaa koi bu daar cheez khaakar jane se manaa kiya jaataa he or is silsile main hadison pavitra jeevani kaa hawala bhi diya jaataa he

 a storm - a tsunami in Japanese, is called the wave near the harbor
 darasal ye bahut lambi - yani saikadon kilometre chaudaai vaali hoti hai, yani ki laharon ke nichle hisson ke bich kaa faaslaa saikadon kilometre kaa hota he
 But when they come near the coast, the lower part of the waves touches the ground, - their speed decreases and height increases
 aisi sthiti main jab ye tat se takkar maarthi hai to tabaahi hoti he
 Speed up to 420 kilometers per hour and height 10 to 18 meters
 yani khaare pani kii chalati diwaar
 These storms are often caused by marine earthquakes
 prashanth mahaasaagar main bahut aam hai, par bengal kii khadi, hind mahaasaagar va arab sagar main nahin
 That is why there is no specific name for them in Indian languages
 samudr ke bheetar achaanak jab badi tej halchal hone lagati he to usamen tufaan uthta he jisase aisi lambii or bahut oonchi laharon kaa rela uthanaa shuru ho jaataa he jo jabardast aaveg ke saath aage badhata he, inhen laharon ke rele ko sunami kehete hai
 In fact, tsunami is a Japanese word which is formed from soo and nami, soo means beach and nami means waves
 pehle sunami ko samudr main uthne vaale jowar ke rup main bhi liya jaataa rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he
 Actually, the waves in the sea arise from the effect of the moon sun and the gravity of the planets, but tsunami waves are different from these common waves
 11 / 03 / 2011 ko bhi yahi hua There are many reasons behind the tsunami waves but the most effective reason is earthquake
 Apart from this, tsunami waves also arise due to land subsidence, volcanic eruptions, some kind of eruption and sometimes meteor impact
 jab kabhi bheeshan bukamp kii vajah se samudr kii upree parat achaanak khisak kar aage bad jaati he to samudr apni samaantar sthiti main upar kii taraf badhane lagata he
 The waves that form at that time are tsunami waves
 iskaa ek udhaaharan ye ho saktaa he ki dharti kii upree parat footbaal kii paraton kii tarah aapas main judi hui he yaa kahen ki ek andey kii tarah se he jisamen daraaren hon
 The first tsunami has also been taken as a rising tide in the sea, but it is not so
 darasal samudr main lahare chaand suraj or grahon ke gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav se uthati hai lekin sunami lehren in aam laharon se alag hoti hai
 As the egg shell is hard, but the substance inside it is lit and wet
 bukamp ke asar se ye daraaren chaudee hokar andar ke padaarth main itani halchal paidaa karti hai ki wo tezi se upar kii taraf kaa rukh kar letaa he
 When the layers of the earth are also broadened by any effect, they move due to which continents are formed
 to is tarah ye sunami lehren banati hai
 But it is also not necessary that every earthquake causes tsunami waves
 iske liye bukamp kaa centre samudr ke andar yaa uske aasapaas hona zaruri he
 When these tsunami waves reach the shallow waters of any layer of any continent from which it is connected to another continent and can be seen as a crack
 vahaan sunami lahar kii tezi kam ho jaati he
 That is because the other continent is also joining at that place and due to the connected layer of earth there is a crack-like place which gives way to the water inside itself
 lekin uske baad bheetar ke pani ke saath mil kar jab sunami kinare kii taraf badhati he to usame itani tezi hoti he ki wo 30 meter tak upar uth sakati he or uske raste main chaahe ped, jangal yaa imaaraten kuch bhi aaen- sabakaa safaaya kar sakati he
 Tsunami waves attack the coastline in a horrific manner and can cause serious damage to life and property
 inaki bhavishyavaanee karnaa mushkil he
 Just as scientists cannot predict earthquakes, so can no guess of tsunamis
 lekin sunami ke ab tak ke record ko dekhakar or mahadwipon kii sthiti ko dekhakar vaigyanik kuch andaaza laga sakate hai
 Wherever the plates or layers of the earth meet, there is a high risk of tsunami in the surrounding sea
 jaise austrailian parat or ureshian parat jahaan milti hai vahaan sthit he sumatra jo ki duusari taraf philippini parat se judaa hua he
 The devastation of tsunami waves is seen there in terrible form

 bharat kaa vibhaajan mountbeton yojana ke aadhaar par nirmit bhartiya swatantraaa adhinium 1947 ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 It was said in this act that on 15 August 1947, two autonomous investments will be made called the Dominion of India and Pakistan and the British Government will hand over power to them
 swatantraaa ke saath hi 14 agast ko pakistan adhirajya or 15 agast ko bhartiya sangh kii sansthapana kii gai
 In this development, mainly the province of Bengal in British India was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal state of India and similarly Punjab province of British India was divided into Punjab province of western Pakistan and Punjab state of India
 isi dauraan british bharat main se ceylone or burma ko bhi alag kiya gaya, lekin ise bharat ke vibhaajan main nahin shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, the partition of Pakistan in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh are also not counted in this development
 15 agast 1947 kii aadhi raat ko bharat or pakistan kanoonee taur par do swatantra raashtra bane
 But Pakistan's power conversion rituals were performed in Karachi on 14 August so that the last British Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, both in Karachi and New Delhi could participate in the rituals
 isliye pakistan main swatantraaa diwas 14 agast or bharat main 15 agast ko manaaya jaataa he
 Crores of people were affected by the partition of India
 vibhaajan ke dauraan hui hinsa main kareeb 5 lakh log maare gaye or kareeb 1
45 karod sharnaarthiyon ne apana ghar-baar chhodkar bahumat sampradaay vaale desh main sharan lee
 The British rulers of India always followed the policy of "divide and rule" in India
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ko sampradaay ke anusaar alag-alag samoohon main baant kar rakhaa
 Some of his policies discriminated against Hindus and some against Muslims
 20veen sadi aate-aate musalmaan hinduon ke bahumat se darane lage or hinduon ko lagane laga ki british sarkaar or bhartiya netaa musalamaanon ko visheshadhikaar dene or hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karne main lage hai
 Therefore, when the spirit of independence began to emerge in India, the leaders of both sects were competing in controlling the freedom struggle
 san 1906 main dhaka main bahut se musalmaan netaaon ne milakar muslim lig kii sthapana kii
 These leaders were of the view that Muslims had less rights than majority Hindus and that the Indian National Congress represented Hindus
 muslim lig ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag maangen rakhin
 In a speech by the famous Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal at the conference of the Muslim League in 1930, for the first time raised the demand for a separate state for Muslims
 1935 main sindh praant kii vidhaan sabha ne bhi yahi maang uthaai
 Iqbal and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah to support this demand
 is samay tak jinna hindu-muslim ekta ke paksh main lagate the, lekin dhire-dhire unhone aarope lagaana shuru kar diya ki congressi netaa musalamaanon ke hiton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 At the 1940 Muslim League Conference in Lahore, Jinnah clearly stated that he wanted two different nations
 hindu mahasabha jaise hindu sanghathan bharat ke bantwaare ke prabal virdohi the, lekin maanate the ki hinduon or musalamaanon main matbhed hai
 In a speech at the conference of Hindu Mahasabha in Allahabad in 1937, Veer Savarkar said - India is not a nation today, there are two nations here - Hindu and Muslim
 congress ke adhiktar netaa panth-nirpeksh the or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bharat kaa vibhaajan karne ke viruddh the
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that Hindus and Muslims could live together and they should live together
 unhone vibhaajan kaa ghor virodh kiya: "meri puri aatma is vichaar ke viruddh vidroh karti he ki hindu or musalmaan do virdohi mat or samskritiyaan hai
 To approve such a doctrine is like rejecting God for me
 " bahut saalon tak gandhi or unke anuyaayiyon ne koshish kii ki musalmaan congress ko chhod kar na jaaen or is prakriya main hindu or musalmaan garam dalon ke netaa unase bahut chidh gaye
 The British plannedly promoted suspicion of both Hindu and Muslim sects
 muslim lig ne agast 1946 main sidhi kaarywahi diwas manaaya or kalakatta main bheeshan dange kiye jisamen kareeb 5000 log maare gayi or bahut se ghayal hue
 In such an environment, all the leaders were under pressure to accept the partition so that the country does not come completely into a state of war
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke dhaanche ko '3 june plan' yaa mountbaton yojana kaa naam diya gaya
 The boundary between India and Pakistan was set by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a London lawyer
 hindu bahumat vaale ilaake bharat main or muslim bahumat vaale ilaake pakistan main shaamil kiye gaye
 On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which finalized the process of partition
 is samay british bharat main bahut se rajya the jinke raajaaon ke saath british sarkaar ne tarah-tarah ke samjhaute kar rakhe the
 These 565 states were given the freedom to choose who they would like to join India or Pakistan
 adhiktar rajyon ne bahumat dharm ke aadhaar par desh chunaa
 There was a lot of controversy in the integration of the states whose rulers chose the country which suited the majority religion
 vibhaajan ke baad pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra main nae sadsy ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya or bharat ne british bharat kii kursi sanbhali
 The wealth of British India was shared between the two countries but this process began to drag on for too long
 gandhiji ne bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalaa ki vah pakistan ko dhan jaldi bheje jabaki is samay tak bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha or dabaav badhaane ke liye anshan shuru kar diya
 The Indian government had to succumb to this pressure and send money to Pakistan
 22 oktober 1947 ko pakistan ne kashmir par akraman kar diya, usase purv mountbaton ne bharat sarkaar se pakistan sarkaar ko 55 karod rupee kii raashi dene kaa paraamarsh diya tha
 The Union Cabinet decided to postpone giving this amount in view of the attack but at the same time Gandhi started a fast-unto-death to get this amount immediately, as a result of which this amount was given to Pakistan against the interests of India
 nathuram godse ne mahatma gandhi ke is kaam ko unki hatya karne kaa ek kaaran bataaya
 Many scholars believe that the British government did not handle the process of partition properly
 chunki swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa pehle or vibhaajan kii ghoshnaa baad main kii gayi, desh main shanti kaayam rakhane kii jimmevary bharat or pakistan kii nayi sarkaron ke sar par ai
 Nobody thought that many people would go from here
 logon kaa vichaar tha ki donon deshon main alpamat sampradaay ke logon ke liye suraksha kaa intazaam kiya jayega
 But the new governments of the two countries did not have the necessary arrangements to deal with violence and crime
 falswaroop danga fasaad hua or bahut se logon kii jane gayi or bahut se logon ko ghar chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 It is estimated that about 5 to 3 million people died during this period, some in riots and some due to travel difficulties

 In the months following Partition, there was a massive mass transfer between the two new countries
 pakistan main bahut se hinduon or sikhon ko balaat beghar kar diya gaya
 But in India Gandhiji pressurized the Congress and ensured that Muslims could stay in India if they wanted
 seemaa rekhaaen tay hone ke baad lagbhag 1
45 karod logon ne hinsa ke dar se seemaa paar karke bahumat sampradaay ke desh main sharan lee
 According to the displaced census of 1951, 72,26,000 Muslims left India after partition and went to Pakistan and 72,49,000 Hindus and Sikhs left Pakistan
 isamen se 78 pratishat sthanantaran pashchim main, mukhyatya punjab main hua
 The transfer of power to India and Pakistan in August 1947 was the first significant step by Britain towards ending colonial rule, with far-reaching consequences for its international power
 bharat kaa yah vibhaajan atharahavin sadi main europe, asia, africa or madhya purv main kiye gaye anek vibhaajanon main se ek he
 In most of the divisions, the violence took place in this division much more than the violence between different religious communities

 He also divided Ireland, Palestine and Cyprus
 usne in vibhaajanon kaa kaaran yah bataaya ki alag-alag samudaayon ke log ek saath milakar nahin kar sakate
 While these divisions were not only due to religious and racial reasons, it also included the strategic and political interests of Britain, on the basis of which it made its strategy at the time of the pacts and carried out partitions

 Many writers have written novels and stories on the Partition of India and the riots that have taken place, the main of which are pinjar ko film or tamas ko prasiddh doordarshan dharawahik ke rup main roopantarit kiya gaya he

 Mechanics has its roots in many ancient civilizations
 nimnaankit chitra main yantriki ke vibhinn kshetron kaa vihangam drishy dikhaaya gaya he- Linguistics is that branch of language study in which scientific and analytical study of the origin, nature, development, etc
 of the language is done
 bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayeta 'bhashavigyaani' kehalaate hai
 Linguistics is different from grammar
 vyakaran main kisi bhashaa kaa kaaryaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he jabaki bhashavigyaani iske aage jaakar bhashaa kaa atyant vyapak adhyayan karata he
 Among the many subjects of study, linguistics is being given special importance nowadays
 bhashaa-sambandhi is adhyayan ko europe main aaj tak anek naamon or sangyaaon se abhihit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Firstly this study was added a word as an adjective next to the word Philology - then it was called as "comparative Philology"
 unnisvin shatabdi tak vyakaran tathaa bhashaa-vishyak adhyayan ko praayah ek hi samajha jaataa tha
 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'
 france main isko langistik naam diya gaya
 The name "linguistique" or "linguistics" has been prevalent in the whole of Europe in the nineteenth century due to the greater language related work in France
 iske atirikt 'science of language', ‘glautoleji’ aadi anya naam bhi is vishay ko prakat karne ke liye kaam main aaye
 Of all these names, "linguistics", "philology" are used only today
 bharatvarsh main in sabhi europea naamon ke atirikt hindi bhashaa main jo naam prayog main laae jate hai ve is prakaar hai- ‘‘bhashaa-shaastra’’, ‘‘bhashaa-tatva’’, ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’, tathaa ‘‘tulanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan’’ aadi
 Among all these names, the most common name is "linguistics"
 in naam main pracheen or naveen sabhi naamon kaa samaahaar-sa hua jaan padataa he
 Therefore, this name seems to be suitable for this scripture
 apane vartmaan swaroop main bhashaa vigyaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke mastishk kii dein kaha jaataa he
 The trend of language-related studies is found in Sanskrit literature since very ancient times
 ‘shiksha’ naamak vedang main bhashaa sambandhi sookshm charchaa uplabdh hoti he
 Detailed description of the pronunciation of the sounds - elements, location, effort etc
 is available in these texts
 ‘praatishakhya’ evam nirukt main shabdon kii vyutpatti, dhaatu, upsarg-pratyay aadi vishyon par vaigyanik vishleshan bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kaha ja saktaa he
 Under Bhartrihari's book 'sentence Pad', subtle, deep and comprehensive thinking of the form of 'word' is available
 vahaan shabd ko ‘brahm’ ke rup main pariklpit kiya gaya he or uski ‘akshar’ sangya bataai gai he
 It is, by default, a language-related book
 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‘shabd’ ’arth’, ‘ras’ ‘bhav’ ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai’ sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‘‘bhashaa’’ tathaa ‘‘vigyaan’’
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‘bhashaa’ shabd sanskrit kii ‘‘bhash’’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‘vigyaan’ shabd main ‘vi’ upsarg tathaa ‘gya’ dhaatu se ‘lut’ pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakavi Dandi has written in his great book 'kavyadarsha' informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‘avyakt vaak’ kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‘vyakt vaak’ nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‘vyakt vaak’ kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‘vyakt vaak’ kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‘yadrichhik’ sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1
 apni chir-parichit bhashaa ke vishay main jigyaasa kii tripti yaa shankaaon kaa nirmulan
 2
 Introduction to historical and prehistoric culture
 3
 kisi jati yaa sampoorn maanavtaa ke maansik vikaas kaa parichay
 4
 Solution of many problems related to the meaning, pronunciation and use of ancient literature
 5
 vishwa ke liye ek bhashaa kaa vikaas
 6
 Assistance in learning foreign languages
 7
 anuwaad karne vaali tathaa swayan tip karne vaali evam isi prakaar kii mashiinon ke vikaas or nirmaan main sahaayta
 8
 Assistance in change in terms of simplicity, correctness etc
 in language, script etc
 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that is found as a divine gift to humans
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When the subjects of linguistics were included under the syllabus of large classes, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that the values that remain for art in a period, new changes are present in the future and they should be accepted in other countries also, it is not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 One of the great features of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been done for the classical subjects like sociology, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be called as inappropriate from any point of view
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- “jis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‘uun namah siddham’ kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‘padmavat’ ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‘somalata’ shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs — buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
 katyayan evam patanjali bhi isi koti main aate hai
 Among Greek scholars, Thrax, Discolus and Erodean also did notable work in this area
 panini se purna prabhavit hokar bluemfield ne san 1932 i
 main 'language' naamak apana granth prakashit karwaakar varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method

 His reign was mostly a period of peace
 lord wiliam bantic ne bhartiya riyasaton ke maamle main ahastkshep kii niti ko apanaaya tha
 He made a treaty with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab, by which the British and Maharaja Ranjit Singh accepted the promotion of trade through the route of Sindh
 wiliam bantic ke bhartiya samaaj main kiye gaye sudhaar aaj bhi prasiddh hai
 He had a significant contribution in ending the Sati system
 apane shasankaal ke antim samay main vah bengal ke governor-general rahe the
 Arriving in India, Lord William Bentinck first came to India as the Governor of Madras, but was recalled when the Sepoy Mutiny in Vellore in 1806 AD
 ikkis varshon ke baad lord amherst dwaara tyaagptr de dene par unhen governor-general niyukt kiya gaya tha or unhone july 1828 i
 main yah pad grahan kar liya
 Bantik's governance is important due to his administrative and social reforms, due to which he became very popular
 inkaa armbh sainik or asainik sevaaon main kifaayatashari baratane se hua
 They increased revenue, especially the income from the monopoly of opium
 falat: jis vaarshik bajet main ghate hote rahete the, unamem bahut bachat hone lagi
 He also abolished the practice of whipping prevalent in the Indian Army

 Bantik reversed Lord Cornwallis' erroneous policy of keeping Indians from high jobs, leaving the company's low jobs and appointing Indians to higher positions like assistant judges
 zila magistrate tathaa zila colector ke pad ko milakar ek kar diya, pradeshik adaalaton ko samaapt kar diya, bharatiyon kii niyuktiyaan achche vetan par dipti magistrate jaise prashaskeey padon par kii tathaa 'diviginal kamishnaron ' ke padon kii sthapana kii

 With the help of Colonel Sleeman, he eradicated the thugs

 He considered it the 'gateway to protection from displeasure'
 unhone madras ke sainik vidroh kaa ullekh karte hue bataaya ki, kalakatta or madras donon jagah sthiti ek jaisi thi, kintu madras main vidroh isliye tha, kyonki vahaan samachar-patron kii swatantraaa nahin thi
 Thus William Bentinck wanted to free Indian newspapers
 kintu 1835 i

 Educational reform shiksha ke kshetra main wiliam bantic ne mahatvapurn sudhaar kiye
 He did a deep study on both the purpose and medium of education
 shiksha ke liye anudaan kaa prayog kaise kiya jaay, yah vichaarneey vishay rahaa
 The controversy was whether the grant should be used for the development of oriental literature or for the development of western literature
 praachya shiksha ke samarthakon kaa netritv 'wilson' va 'princep' ne kiya tathaa paashchaatya vidya ke samarthakon kaa netritv ‘travolian’ ne, jisko raja rammohan raay kaa bhi samarthan praapt tha
 Finally, a committee was formed under the chairmanship of Lord Macaulay to settle this dispute, which gave its decision in support of Western science
 usne apane vichaaron ko 2 farvari, 1835 i
 ke suprasiddh samaran patr main pratipaadit kiya
 Lord Macaulay's plan in his proposals was to "create a class that is Indian by color and blood, but English by nature, thought, morality and intelligence
" ' maikale ke vichaar 7 march, 1835 i

 ahalya athwa ahilya hindu mithkon main varnit ek stri paatr hai, jo gautam rishi kii patni thim
 His story is found sporadically in the Brahmins and Puranas and his story is described in detail in the Ramayana and later Ramakathas
 brahma dwaara rachit vishwa kii sundartam striyon main se ek ahalya kii katha mukhya rup se indra dwaara inke shilharan or iske parinamswaroop gautam dwaara diye gaye shaap kaa bhaajan bananaa tathaa ram ke charansparsh se shapamukti ke rup main he

 The word Ahalya can be divided into two parts: a and Halya, which is related to the Sanskrit meaning plow, plow or distortion
 ramayana ke uttar kand main brahma dwaara iskaa arth bina kisi asundarata ke bataaya gaya he, jahaan brahma indra ko yah bataa rahe hai ki kis prakaar sristi kii sundartam rachanaaon se tatv lekar unhone ahalya ke angon main unka samavesh karke ahalya kii rachana kii
 Gnanamandal, Varanasi published modern dictionary writes with the same meaning: "ahalya - Hull means ugly, so Brahma gave him the name Ahalya due to not having any ugliness
 " Since some Sanskrit lexicon Ahalya writes the meaning of a land that is not plowed, later writers, considering it associated with the male congregation, denote Ahalya as Kumari or Akshata
 yah us parampara ke anukool padataa he jisamen yah mana gaya he ki ahalya ekanek prakaar se indra kii lipsaa se mukt or unki pahunch se baahar rahi
 Ravindranath Tagore, however, posits the designation of "ahalya" as "the one who cannot be plowed", which Rama's footsteps made him energetic
 dilli vishvavidhyalay kii professor bharti jhaveri bhil janajati kii maukhik parampara main maujuud ramayana ke anusaararabindranath k mat kaa samarthan karti hai or iskaa arth "jise jota na gaya ho aisi zamin" ke rup main bataati hai
 When Rama and Lakshman went out to see the forest groves of Mithilapuri with sage Vishwamitra, they saw a deserted place in a park
 ram bole, "bhagwan! yah sthaan dekhne main to ashram jaisaa dikhaai detaa he kintu kya kaaran he ki yahan koi rishi yaa muni dikhaai nahin dete?" Vishwamitra told that this place was once the ashram of Maharishi Gautama
 ve apni patni ke saath yahan rah kar tapasya karte the
 One day when Gautam Rishi went outside the ashram, in his absence, Indra disguised himself as Gautam Rishi and pleaded with Ahalya
 yadhyapi ahilya ne indra ko nahin pahachaanaa, rishi gautam ko jaanakar ahilya ne pranay hetu apni sweekruti de di
 When Indra was returning to his world, coming back to his ashram, the sight of Gautam Rishi who was disguising himself as Indra
 ve sab kuch samaj gayi or unhone indra ko shaap de diya
 After this, he cursed his wife that Ray misbehaver! You have been lying here in the ashes for thousands of years, suffering only by drinking air
 jab ram is van main pravesh karenge tabhi unki krupa se tera uddhaar hoga
 Only then you will be able to come to me after wearing your former body
 yah kah kar gautam rishi is ashram ko chhodkar himalay par jaakar tapasya karne lage
 That is why Vishwamitra Ji said, "O Ram! Now you go inside the ashram and save Ahalya
" " vishwamitra ji kii baat sunakar ve donon bhai ashram ke bheetar pravisht huye
 There Ahilya was not seen anywhere in penance, only her fast was spreading in the whole environment
 jab ahilya kii drushti ram par padi to unke pavitra darshan paakar ek baar phir sundar nari ke rup main dikhaai dene lagi
 Rama and Lakshmana reverently touched her feet in front of Ahilya in female form
 usase uchit aadar satkar grahan kar ve muniraaj ke saath punah mithila puri ko laut aaye
 There is a famous verse about Ahalya: sanskrit shlokehalya draupadi sita tara mandodari tathaa
 Panchakanya: Smrennityam Mahapadakashinya: 4
 shlokarvahalya, draupadi, sita, tara or mandodari inkaa pratidin samaran karnaa chahie, maha paapon kaa naash karne vaali hai
 Note: In another form, in this verse Kunti is written instead of Sita
 paramparawaadi hindu, khaas taur par hindu patniyaan, panchakanyaon kaa samaran praatavkalin prarthana main karti hai, inhen paanch kumariyaan mana jaataa he
 According to one opinion, these are the five "exemplary holy women" or Mahastis according to the Mahari dance tradition, and are also masters of certain powers
 is mat ke anusaar ahalya in paancho main sabase pramukh hai jinhen chhalpurvak bhrasht kiya gaya jabaki unki apane pati ke prati purna nishtha thi
 Ahalya is also considered to be prominent among the five because these characters are also the first in chronological order
 devi bhagwat puraana main ahalya ko ek prakaar se un dwitiya koti kii deviyon main sthaan diya gaya he, jin deviyon ko shubh, yashaswini or prashansaneey mana gaya he; inamen tara or mandodari ke alaava panchasatiyon main se arundhati or damyanti ityadi bhi shaamil kii gayi hai
 Other views do not see Panchakanya as an ideal woman and do not consider them exemplary
 bhattacharya, jo panch-kanya: di five virgins of indian apikes ke lekhak hai, panchakanyaon or panchasatiyon, sati sita, savitri, damyanti or arundhati, ke madhya tulanaatmak vichaar prakat karte hue poochhate he:"to kya tab ahalya, draupadi, kunti, tara or mandodari sachharitra patniyaan nahin hai kyonki inamen se prayek ne apane pati ke alaava ek par purush ko janaa ?" Since she exhibits a business that contradicts normative ideals, Indian social reformer Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay expresses her astonishment that Ahalya and Tara have been included in the Panchakanyaas
 haalaanki, ahalya ke is atyantagaman ne unhen paap kaa bhaagi banaaya or unhen vah ucch sthaan nahin praapt jo sita or savitri jaisi striyon ko mila, unke is kaary ne unhen kathaon main amar kar diya
 The place where Ahalya completed the period of her curse and where the curse was released is mentioned in the texts as ahalya-tirtha and is consecrated as a holy place
 tirth sthal vah jagah yaa jal bhandar hota he jahaan aamtaur par hindu tirthayatri snaan karke apane paapon se mukt hone kii manyata rakhte hai
 There is a dispute about the actual location of the ahalya-tirtha: according to some texts it is situated on the banks of the Godavari River while some texts consider it to be situated on the banks of the Narmada
 do aise pramukh sthaan hai jinke ahalya tirth hone kaa daawa sabase majbootee se prastut kiya jaataa he
 First, the Ahalyeswarar Temple on the banks of the Narmada near Balod in Madhya Pradesh; Second temple located in Darbhanga district of Bihar
 ahilya asthaan naamak mandir or ahalya-gram bhi isi zile main sthit hai jo ahalya ko samarpit hai
 In the Matsya Purana and the Kuram Purana, men who aspire to be like Kamdev's appearance and attract women are suggested to go to the Ahalya Tirtha and worship Ahalya
 yah upasna kaamdev ke maah, caitra, main karne ko kaha gaya he or granthon ke anusaar is tirth main snaan karne vaala vyakti apsaraon kaa sukh bhogata he
 According to Bhattacharya, Ahalya represents the eternal form of the woman who is not able to ignore the inner desires of you, nor the high feelings of purity that lies in her sane husband who cannot fulfill her physical desires
 And contrasts with her personal desires
 lekhak ahalya ko ek swatantra nari ke rup main dekhtaa he jo apana khud kaa nirnay leti he, utsukata ke vasheebhoot hokar jokhim uthaati he, or ant main apane krity kaa dand bhi us shaap ke rup main sweekaar karti he jo purushpradhan samaaj ke pratinidhi uske pati dwaara lagaaya jaataa he
 Oblivious to the curse is the only act that compels Ramayana to praise this character and establish him as a believable and exemplary character
 bhattacharya kii tarah hi, sabordination of vuman: a new persepective pustak kii lekhika minaa kelkar yah mahasoos karti hai ki ahalya ko isliye shraddhey bana diya gaya kyonki vah purush pradhan samaaj ke lingabhed ke aadarshon ko sweekaar kar leti he; vah shaap ko bina kisi pratirodh ke sweekaar kar leti he or maanati he ki use dandit kiya janaa chahie tha
 Apart from this, Kelkar also adds that another reason for declaring Ahalya as great in the texts may be to warn women and curse them by the curse she received
 hindu mithkon main varnit is katha se kuch milti julati katha unani mithkon main bhi praapt hoti he, jahaan zyoos, devataaon kaa raja, jo ek tarah se indra ke hi samaan he, alakmini ke pati kaa rup dhar kar chhalpurvak uske saath sansarg karata he jisase prasiddh kathapurush harculis kaa janm hota he
 Like Ahalya, there are two versions of this Greek tale, one of which shows that Alchemini associates with Zeus despite recognizing the treachery, while in the second version he is innocent and a victim of deceit
 donon kathaon main pramukh antar yah he ki alkmini ke saath sansarg dwaara harkulies jaisi santan kii utpatti ke kaaran se zyoos kaa kaary nyyochit tehraaya jaataa he or or alkmini par bhi koi aarope dushcharitra hone kaa nahin lagata; ahalya ke kaary ko kaamuk aacharan maanakar na keval use iske liye bura sabit kiya jaataa he balki shaap ke rup main sazaa bhi praapt hoti he
 Story of ahalya tamralipt yaa tamralipti bengal kii khadi main sthit ek pracheen nagar tha
 Scholars believe that the present Tamluk was the ancient Tamralipti
 aisa mana jaataa he ki maury samrajya ke dakshin asia tathaa dakshin-purv asia ke liye yah nagar vyapaarik nikaas bindu tha
 The modern Tamluk or Tamluk of Midnapore district of West Bengal which is situated on the western bank of the Rupnarayan river, 33 miles southwest of Calcutta
 yadhyapi samudr se isaki vartmaan duuri 60 mile he, pracheen or madhyakaalin yug main 17veen shatabdi tak samudr usko choota tha or vah bharatvarsh ke dakshin-purvi tat kaa ek prasiddh bandargah tha
 Tamralipti was not only a city, but also a large district
 un dinon ganga nadi bhi uske nagar ke paas se hokar hi bahati thi or uske dwaara samudr se mili hone ke kaaran nagar kaa bahut bada vyapaarik mahatv tha
 The famous geographer Pliny, who wrote in relation to India, called it 'tamlitz'
 pracheen tamralipti nagar ke khandhar nadi kii upjau ghati main ab bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 The importance of the Tamralipati district and its port would have increased after the Indians became aware of the countries of East India and south-east across the sea
 sarvapratham mahabharat main uski charchaa milti he, jisamen yah kaha gaya he ki bhimsen ne vahaan ke raja ko haraakar kar vasuul kiya tha
 With the coming of the Mauryan era, its importance was definitely clearly visible
 plini ek aisi sadak kaa varnan karata he jo uttari pashchimi simapraant main pushkaravati se pranrabh hokar takshashila, hastinapur, aadhunik anupshahar or dibai hote hue kannoj, prayag, varanasi or patliputra tak jaati thi
 In between she used to cross the Indus, Jhelum, Vyas, Sutlej, Yamuna and Ganga
 patiliputra ke aage bhi vah purv main gangasagar tak jaati thi or tamralipti sthal hi uskaa antim bindu rahaa hoga
 ] And the description of the naval division of Mauryo in the descriptions of Greek writers, it can be easily inferred from the terrestrial trade with the aquatic trade
 is drushti se tamralipti kii prakritik sthiti kaa is kaaran bada adhik mahatv hoga ki bahu dakshini-purvi bharat ko hi nahin samudrapar ke deshon ko bhi madhya asia ke nagaron se jodta tha
 Later, as the countries of south-east Asia became aware and India's business, cultural and political relations grew from them, the prominence of Tamralipti also increased
 chauthi shatee se 12veen shatee tak vahaan anek deshon ke jahaaj lage rahete the
 From there, exports of indigo, mulberry and pasham were exported to outside countries
 ashok ke samay se tamralipti kaa buddha dharm sambandhi mahatv bhi bad gaya
 In the Buddhist texts of sinhala-mahavansh and Deepvansh, he is called Tamlapati or Tamralipti and in the Deepvansh he is called Tamralitti or Tamralipti and it is reported from him that Ashoka had sent the Sinhala, the branch of Bodhivriksha, by ship
 us avasar par sway ashok ganga ko paar karte hue patliputra se vahaan pahunche the
 At the beginning of the fifth century, Fahyan also went to Sinhala by sea
 harshavardhan ke samay jab yuvanchwad bharatvarsh aayaa tha usne tamralipti dekha
 There he also saw some Buddhist viharas and a pillar made of Ashoka
 intsag ne china se bharat aate samay apana jahaaj vahiin choda tha
 Later Chinese travelers coming to India also did the same
 malay prayadweep or hind china ke dweepasmoohon main bhartiya rajkumaron ne jab apane upnivesh sthapit kiye honge, un dinon bhi tamralipti bharat se avaagaman kaa dwaar rahaa hoga
 But during the medieval period of Indian history, its commercial importance must have diminished somewhat and when the commercial castes from Europe came to be used only in the western coast of India
 taamluk The digestive system of humans consists of a dietary canal and associate glands
 aahaar-naal, mukhaguha, grasani, grasika, amashay, choti aant, badi aant, malashay or maladwar se bani hoti he
 Supporting digestive glands are the salivary gland, liver, gall bladder and pancreatic
 aahaar padaarthon ke vishesh ghatak protein, carbohydrate, vasa, vitamin, khanij lavan or jal hai
 All foods are made up of these components
 kisi main koi ghatak adhik hota he, koi kam
 Our body is also made of these ingredients
 sharir kaa 2 / 3 bhaag jal he
 Protein is the main body of the body from which organs are formed
 carbohydrate glucose ke rup main sharir main rahata he, jisaki mansapeshiyon ko sadaa aavashyaktaa hoti he
 An excessive amount of fat is also stored in the body
 vitamin or lavenon kii aavashyaktaa sharir kii kriyaaon ke uchit sampadan ke liye hoti hai
 Our body gets all these things from food
 haan, aahaar se milane vaale avyavon kaa rasinic rup sharir ke avyavon ke rup se bhinn hota he
 Therefore, the body decomposes the components of the diet into its subtle components by digestive juices and by re-synthesizing those components, prepares the ingredients suitable for them
 yah kaam angon kii koshikaaye karti hai
 It leaves out the components that are not useful
 sharir aise padaarthon ko mel, mutr, swead or shwaas dwaara baahar nikaal detaa he
 The purpose of digestion is to divide the esoteric ingredients of the diet into simple components
 yah kaary munh main lala ras dwaara, amashay main jathar ras dwaara, grahani main agnyashay ras tathaa pitt dwaara or kshundaatra main antraras dwaara sampadit hota he
 These works are briefly described here: mukh main aahaar daanton dwaara chabaakar sookshm kanon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he or usamen laar miltaa rahata hai, jisamen tylin naamak enzim mila rahata he
 This juice is made in the cupric gland outside the mouth and in the adrenal and adrenal glands
 in grathiyon se, visheshkar aahaar ko chabate samay unki vahniyon dwaara, laar ras munh main aata rahata he
 Its action is alkaline
 uske tylin anzime kii rasinic kriya visheshkar carbohydrate par hoti hai, jisase uskaa starch pehle dextrin main or tatpashchaat glucose main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The same changes in the sugar of ordinary reed
 aahaar ke grass ko geela or snigdh karnaa bhi lala kaa mukhya karm hai, jisase vah sahaj main niglaa ja sake or patala grass naal main hota hua amashay main pahunch jaay
 Swallowing is done inside the mouth by the muscles of the tongue and the muscles of the pharynx
 jihva kii peshiyon ke sankoch se jihva upar ko uthakar taalu or jihvaprishth par rakhe hue grass ko dabaati he, jo vahaan se phisalkar peeche grasani se chalaa jaataa he
 Immediately, the muscles of the pharynx hesitate and the Grass enters the esophagus, passing through the gland, where the circular and longitudinal sutures in its reefs lead it to the end of the placenta by its inhibition and expansion
 or grass jatharadwar dwaara amashay main pravesh karata he
 Digestion in the stomach is done by gastritis
 amashay kii shleshmal kala kii granthiyaan yah ras utpann karti hai
 When the food reaches the stomach, this juice starts to flow from the surrounding glands to the stomach at such a rapid rate as if it is being poured out
 is ras ke do mukhya avyav pepsin naamak angm or hydrochloric amla hote hai
 Pepsin has a special action on proteins, in which hydrochloric acid helps
 is kriya se protein pehle phool jaataa he or phir baahar se galane lagata he
 Due to this, the inner part of the grass gets late
 isse lala ke tilin enzim kii kriya us samay tak hoti rahati he jab tak lala kaa sara kshar amashay ke amlik ras dwaara udasin nahin ho jaataa
 Metaprotein is formed before protein by the action of gastric juice
 phir yah proteoseze main badal jaataa he
 The proteases then break down into peptones
 isse adhik parivartan nahin hota
 There are also two more enzymes in gastric juice, which are called amylase and lipase
 aimylez karbohydrate ko galaata he or lypez vasa ko
 It also contains renin, another enzyme that breaks down milk
 isamen halaki jeevanunashak shakti bhi hoti he
 The secretion of gastric juice is mainly under the nervous system
 sharirkriya vigyaan ke vikhyath roosi vidwaan pavelof ke prayogon ne is sambandh main bahut prakaash daalaa he
 It has been proved from them that the smell of food starts smelling from the nose and seeing them through the eyes
 yahi kaaran he ki uttam aahaar padaarthon ke banane kii gandh se hi bhukh maaloom hone lagati he tathaa unako dekhne se kshudha bad jaati he
 Applying on the tongue causes a desire to eat immediately
 yadi aahaar padaarth uttam yaa ruchikar nahin hote to bhukh mar jaati he
 Digestion of such food is also not done properly
 usase ras kaa srav bhi kam hota he
 The process of gastric juice is particularly on protein
 maance, anda, machhlee, doodh ke padaarthon aadi ke amashay main pahunchne par ras kaa srav hota hai
 If salt, ice or pebbles, etc
 are given to eat, there will be no discharge
 pachan se agnyashay or yakrut in do badi grathiyon kaa bahut sambandh he
 Pancreas juice is produced in the pancreas
 yah bahut hi prabal pachak ras he, jisaki kriya protein, carbohydrate tathaa vasa teenon ghatakon par hoti he
 It is formed by the cells of the pancreas gland and collected from all the pancreas, this juice reaches the duodenum through a duct
 pitashay se pitt ko laanevaali vahini is agnyashayvahini se milakar saamaanya pittavahini ban jaati he
 Through his mouth, both the pancreas and bile, the juices, reach the duodenum
 agnyashayi granthi udar main bain ore amashay ke peeche sthit he
 Its large head rests in the bend of the duodenum and its tail has gone to the left spleen
 iskaa rang kuch matamaila bhura sa hota he
 Its subtle parts appear to be raised like mulberry grains
 agnyashay ras kii prabal kriya visheshkar protein par hoti he
 This causes the protein to dissolve without bloating
 is ras kii kriya kshareey hoti he
 This causes the first alkaline metaprotein to form
 tab metaprotein se proteos banate hai
 The proteases are then converted into peptones
 ant main peptone ke vibhanjan se amino amla ban jate hai, jo protein ke pachan ke antim utpaada hote hai
 Peptones that come as a result of digestion of proteins from the stomach also break down into amino acids
 agnyashay ras ke srav par tantrika mandal kaa koi niyantran nahin he
 The stimulation of nerves does not produce more or less of the juice
 ras kii utpatti us samay prarambh hoti he jab amashay main paachit aahaar, jo ardh drav rup kaa hota he, amashay se pyloric chhidr dwaara nikalakar grahani main aata he
 Through contact with this acidic chym, a chemical substance called secretin is produced in the mucous level cells of the duodenum
 yah vastu rakt dwaara agnyashay kii koshikaon main pahunchakar unako ras banane ke liye uttejit karti he or tab ras banakar grahani main aane lagata he
 The second feature of this juice is that if this juice is collected in the pancreas before reaching the duodenum, it remains inactive
 uski protein par koi kriya nahin hoti
 When it joins the duodenum, it combines with the intestinal juice, only then it produces a strong power to decompose the protein
 yah mana jaataa he ki antric ras kaa anterokinage naamak enzim usko sakriy kar detaa he
 These are the following: udar ke daahine bhaag main upar kii ore sharir kii yakrut naamak sabase badi granthi he, jo pitt kaa nirmaan karti he
 From there, the bile gets collected in the gall bladder and reaches the duodenum by a duct during digestion
 yakrut se sidhaa grahani main bhi pahunch saktaa hai
 It is a thick green liquid
 vasa ke pachan main isse sahaayta milti he
 The food from the duodenum, which contains its digestible components, falls in the first part of the esophagus
 is samay vah shahad ke samaan gadha hota he or kshudantra main bhalee prakaar pravaahit ho saktaa he
 Digestion continues here too
 kuch samay tak agnyashayi pachan jari rahata he
 The juice of the intestines also has digestive power
 vah protein ko to nahin, kintu proteos or paptone ko amino amlon main tod saktaa he
 But its special action is to activate dipsin amylase and lipase enzymes
 pavelof kaa, jisane sabase pehle is vishay main anveshan kiye the, mat he ki antra ras ke milane se pehle ye teenon enzim apane purv rup main rahete hai or isi kaaran niskriy hote hai
 Trypsin lives as trypsinogen
 amiles or lypez bhi purv dasha main rahete hai
 When enterocrine is found in the pancreas, trypsinogen produces trypsin and the rest of the enzymes are also activated
 antric ras ke milane se purv agnyashay ras niskriy hota he
 The function of the esophagus is exclusively absorption
 isaki aantarik rachana ke chitra ko dekhne se maaloom hoga ki uske bheetar shleshmal kala main, jo saare antra ko bheetar se aachhadit kiye hue hai, gahari silawatein bani hui hai, jisase kala kaa prishth antra se kahin adhik ho jaataa he
 There are sprouts on the folds of art
 in sabakaa kaam avasorana karnaa he
 The subtle composition of the seedlings is also worth noting
 prayek ankur ke bich main ek shwetanlika uske shikhar ke paas tak chali gai he
 It is akshiravahini
 iske donon ore kaali rekhaayen dikhaai detii hai, jo dhamni or shiraaon kii shakhaayen or koshikaaye hai
 Both these types of structures, vessels and arteries and veins, go out or down and are found in the large blood vessels and vessels in the epidemiological level
 vasa kaa shleshmalkala dwaara avasorana hokar vah akshirvahiniyon main pahunch jaati he or ant main rakt main mil jaati he
 After absorption of glucose and protein they reach the blood by blood capillaries
 rakt in teenon avyavon ko sharir ke prayek ang kii koshikaon tak pahunchaata or unka poshan karata he
 This is the special function of the 20-22 feet long tubule
 brihadantra kaa kaary keval avasorana he
 This organ especially absorbs water
 malatyag ke samay mel jis rup main baahar nikalataa he, vah brihadantra ke ant or malashay main ban jaataa he
 In 24 hours, the colon absorbs water
 jal ke atirikt vah thode glucose kaa bhi avasorana karata he, par or kisi padaarth kaa avasorana nahin karata
 Apart from this, iron, magnesium, calcium etc
 are sacrificed in the colon itself
 yahan unka utsarg hokar ve mel main mil jate hai
 The action of bacteria also aids digestion
 kshudantra main ve protein, vasa tathaa starch aadi kaa bhanjan karte hai
 In the colon, they also dissolve cellulose, which does not contain any digestive juices
 isi se hydrogen sulphide, mithen aadi gaisen utpann hoti hai tathaa vasa ke bhanjan se vasaml banate hai, jinke kaaran mel kii kriya amlik ho jaati he
 This movement continues throughout the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the rectum, which leads to continued eating or digestion
 anya aashyon main tathaa vahikaaon main bhi yah gati hoti he
 There are circular circles outside the mucosa level and levels of longitudinal musculature outside them
 vrittakar sutron ke sankoch se naal kii chaudaai sankuchit ho jaati he
 Therefore, hesitantly, part of the diet ahead cannot return to the rear
 tabhi anudairdhya sutara sankoch karke naal ke us bhaag kii lambaai kam kar dete hai
 Therefore, the diet progresses further
 phir aage ke bhaag main isi prakaar kii kriya se vah or aage badhata he
 This is called entrapment
 duusari khandibhavan gati bhi naal kii bhitti main hoti rahati he
 These movements, in addition to helping to advance the diet, churn the chime in a good way, causing a close contact between the digestive juices and the particles of the diet
 bhinn bhinn pachak rason kii kriya kaa jo varnan kiya gaya he usase spasht he ki prakruti ne aisa prabandh kiya he ki aahaar padaarthon ke sab avyav, jo jautav sharir main bhi upasthit rahete hai, vyarth na jane paaen
 Use them as much as possible in the body
 unase sharir ke toote phute bhaagon kaa nirmaan ho, nae utak bhi bane or kaam karne kii urja utpann ho
 This is the purpose of diet and differentiating the different ingredients of the diet into their very subtle elements, so that they are absorbed and the cells of the body prepare their essential things from them, this is the purpose of digestion
 vastav main jisko saadhaaran bolchaal main pachan kaha jaataa he, usamen do kriyaaon kaa bhav chipa rahata he, pachan or avasorana
 Digestion is simply the breakdown of the components of the diet into its components, which are the result of digestive juices
 unka avasorana hokar rakt main pahunchnaa duusari kriya he, jo kshudantra ke rasankuron kaa vishesh karm he
 Any part of the diet that remains in the bowel after digestion and absorption is the same stool
 atev mel main aahaar kaa kuch apchy bhaag bhi hota he tathaa antra kii shleshmal kala ke tukade hote hai
 Apart from these, there are very large numbers of bacteria
 yah hisaab lagaaya gaya he ki prayek baar mel main 15,00,00,00,000 jeevanu sharir se nikalate hai
 They come from the colon itself
 vahi jeevanuon kaa nivasasthaan he
 Due to this there is a lot of nitrogen in the stool, which makes it a good fertilizer
 malatyag kii ek prativart kriya he, jiskaa sampadan tantric mandal ke aatmag vibhaag dwaara hota he
 When feces are collected in the rectum, they are injected into the cells of the warts of the spinal cord from the rectum reefs, from where they are sent to the cells of the precursors
 vahaan se nae samveg prerak tantric sutron dwaara malashay main pahunchakar, vahaan kii sanvarni peshiyon kaa vistaar kar dete or malashay kii bhittiyon kii antragati badha dete hai
 At the same time, we have a desire to have a bowel movement, and we have a bowel movement when we sit and loose the muscular muscles
 upar kii peshiyon ke sankoch karne par udar ke bheetar kii daab badhane se bhi malatyag main bahut sahaayta milti he

 jo is baat se sammat nahin hai vah sawaal karte hai ki chikitsakeekaran kyon? kis dasha ke liye? or kiske saath? or is parighatna kaa parinaam kya he? According to Peter Conrad, since 1970, in the last two decades, the social movement, interest group, interprofessional and organization has mostly shifted towards medicalization under the study of medical profession
 yah artical pichley do dashakon main aa rahe medikalaijeshan ke prakriya main aae badlaaon ko darshata he jisamen medicine prakriya mahatvapurn he
 The author, using a variety of cases in this article, argues that medicine and its organizational form have undergone three important changes that drive the process of medicinalization: biotechnology, consumer, and managed care
 The doctor is standing in the medical treatment like a gatekeeper, but in the contraction or dilatation of medullaisation, his role has become subordinate

 Ramnama literally means 'rama's name'
 'ramanaam' se aashay vishnu ke avatar ram kii bhakthi se he yaa phir nirgun nirankaar param brahm se
 The name of Rama is chanted or chanted in various sects of Hinduism
 "shriram jai ram jai jai ram" ek prasiddh mantra he jise pashchimi bharat main samarth ramdaas ne lokapriy banaaya
 In the Indian literature, there are references of many great men of Rama, from the Vedic period to the saga period, but the most famous among them was Rama, son of Ayodhyanaresh Dasaratha, the hero of Valmiki Ramayana
 unka charit jaateey jivan kaa mukhya preranarot ban gaya

 isa kii duusari se chauthi shatabdi ke bich vishnu athwa narayan ke avatar ke rup main unki puja bhi aarambh ho gai
 Among the वारalvars, Shatkop, the melodious poet and Kulasekara and the Vaishnavacharyas, Ramanuja expressed special allegiance to Rāmāvatara but by the end of the fourteenth century Ramopasana continued to flourish as a personal practice; Swami Ramanand is credited with organizing it as an independent sect
 unhone ramtarak athwa shadakshar ramamantra ko vaishnav sadhana ke itihaas main pehali baar 'beej mantra' kaa gaurav pradaan kiya or manushyamaatr ko ramanaam jap kaa adhikaar ghoshit kiya
 Goswami Tulsidas, the inventor of this tradition, endorsed this ideology, calling Ramnama as 'mantra Raj', 'beej Mantra' and 'mahamantra' as the only means of salvation of the downtrodden beings
 unhone use vedon kaa praan, tridevon kaa kaaran or brahm ram se bhi adhik mahimayukta kahkar namaraadhan main ekant nishtha vyakt kii
 As communal devotion developed, chanting Ramnama meaningfully became an essential part of spiritual practice
 anya naamon kii apeksha brahm ke gunon kii abhivyakti kii kshamta 'ram' main adhik dekhakar use pranav kii samakakshata kii mahatta pradaan kii gai
 Vaishnava devotees presented various interpretations of 'ramnama' suited to communal beliefs
 sagunmargi maryaadaavadi bhakton ne use loksansthapanarth aishwaryapurna lilaon ke vidhayak ramchandra or rasik bhakton ne saundarya maadhuryadi divya gunon se vibhooshit saketvihari 'yugal sarkaar' kaa vyanjak bataaya kintu nirgunmargi santon ne use yogiyon ke chitt ko ramaanevaale, sarvavyaapak, sarvatarami, jagannivas niraakaar brahm kaa hi bodhak mana
 This popularity of Ramnam paved the way for the development of 'ram bhakti'
 uski aseem tarak shakti, sarvasulabhta tathaa bhaktavatsalata kaa anubhav kar bhavuk upaskon ne archan tathaa padasewan ko chhodkar naam ke prati saptadha bhakthi arpit kii, jinamein shravan, kirthan tathaa samaran ko vishesh mahatv mila
 Tulsi regarded her as both swami and Sakha and Banadas established a sweet bond with her
 yah namopasna rambhakti shakha main hi simit na rahi
 Surrah and Meera, the worshipers of Lilapurusottam, have also expressed their deep Ramnamaakti in their works
 rambhakti kii rasik shakha main namabhakti kii prapti ke liye namsadhana kii anek pranaliyaan pravartit hui
 Rasakha performed rituals at Kamdavan in Chitrakoot for twelve years and Banadas made a cave at Ramghat in Ayodhya for fourteen years to recite the Aakarish, adorned in Ahurnish chanting

 In the second, knowledge of the importance, meaning and chanting of the name is obtained
 naadhyansanjyak teesri sthiti namsadhana kaa antim sopan he
 It has three levels - tadhanadhyana, aartidhyana and muktikdhyana
 tadan kaa arth he dand dena
 Therefore, in the first stage, lust is extracted from the inner conscience by giving continuous injury to Ramnam

 His divine aura opens the mindset of the seeker
 tab vah apni udbuddha pragna se dhyey kaa abhinandan athwa aarti karata he
 In the third stage, a seeker freed from the bondage, attains the ultimate purushartha by interviewing a separate body or spirit from his gross body
 iske falswaroop lokyatra main jivanmukti kaa sukh bhogata hua sadhak swechhanusaar sharir tyagkar upasya kii nityalila main pravesh karata he
 Ramnaam's reputation remained intact even in the extreme anti-incarnation of Avatarism due to receiving direct inspiration from Swami Ramanand
 aadi sant kabir ne nirgun brahm se uskaa tadatmya sthapit kar namsadhana ko ek nayaa mode diya
 His successor Nanak, Dadu, Gulal, Jagjivan, etc
, metaphysics, with one voice, accepted him as the basic mantra of Nirgunpanth
 inaki naam athwa 'jikir' sadhana tantric adarsh par nirmit hone se pranayam kii jatil vidhiyon se samanvit thi
 Describing the turning of the garland from the fingers and rote the Ramnama from the tongue, these saints chanted the consultation of the supreme element with the inner mindfulness, which is attained by Ramanastha by inhaling the sushumna path except the pingala
 And 'anahata Naam' starts being heard

 It is impossible to achieve this only by expressive nomination
 manarati ke tanrati kii yah anivaaryta santon kii namsadhana main yogatv kii pramukhataa siddh karti he
 The main reason for the variation in the above mentioned methods of Namasadhana promoted by saints and Vaishnava devotees is their theoretical differences
 sakaarwaadi, bhakthi main shuddh prem athwa bhav tatv ko adhik mahatv dete hai, kintu niraakaaravaadi, gyaan tathaa yoga tatv ko
 One cannot imagine the name without the sagacious form

 In this situation, the feeling of his separate existence from worshiper in the heart of the worshiper is constant, but the philosophy-spontaneous nirgunamruti, which is covered with the name juice, reaches into a state without truth and forgets itself

 This proposal is the enemy to the openness of the whole wikipedia community

 Thank you

 --yurik 03:11, 24 disambar 2005 There is a lot of vandlism here and this wikipedia needs a lot of activity
 i found there is no afd, the common
css is empty, the guidelines are very few
 Where do we discuss all the changes needed here? The mailing list has no activity since months
 The article Wikipedia: How to start a new page redirects to my new membership, which is nothing but spam
 This has to be deleted, but i don't know where to list this request, as there is no afd

 "stub" and "substub" are English dialects
 mujhe lagata he ki aise angrezi alfaaz istamaal karne se lekh samajhnaa thodaa mushakil ho jaataa he
 We can definitely use some Hindi word for them! agar mai apni raay pesh karun to ham "stub" ke badale me "paudha" or"sabstub" ke badale me "beej" istamaal kar sakate hai
 These inscribe the condition of the script clearly, and also introduce vicky-kalpana
 ninorsk vikipedia pe hamane aise hi kuch kiya
 It was just my idea - if you don't like it, then it doesn't matter
 -- aravind 15:21, 9 june 2006 i think the issue has been that words like "stub" or "substub" do not matter to Hindi users
 par "ankur" yaa "paudh" jaise alankaarit shabd rakhane se bhi khaas laabh nahin hoga kyonki naye prayoktaaon yaa pathakon ke ye shabd bhi stub jitne hi anjaan shabd honge
 It is better if words with direct meaning are taken, such as "immature" for the substub and "initial" or "initial" or "base" for the stub
 agar aap likhenge "yah ek aadhaar lekh he" yaa "yah aparipakv lekh he" to myne zyada spasht honge
 i support Debashish's talk
 shabd saral hona chahie
 The word "immature" may sound that is not a stub, they are mature and even if they do not contribute
 to "aadhaar lekh" shabd zyada upyukt hoga
 If the word looks like it should increase the article then it would be more appropriate
