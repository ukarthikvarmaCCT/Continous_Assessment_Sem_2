 Antioxidants or antibodies are compounds that are mixed with small amounts of other substances to inhibit their reaction with the oxygen of the atmosphere
 in yogicon ko oxikaran nirodhak tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai
 That is, anti-oxidants are molecules that protect other molecules from oxidation or slow down the oxidation process of other molecules
 oxikaran ek prakaar kii rasinic kriya he jiske dwaara kisi padaarth se electron yaa hydrogen oxikaarak agent ko sthanantarit ho jate hai
 Antioxidants are used in medical science and industry
 petrol main pratioxikaarak milaae jate hai
 These antioxidants do not allow the formation of viscosity-causing substances that are harmful to the internal combustion engine
 praayah pratisthapit phenol evam fenilanediamine ke vyutpann is kaam ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Many compounds are automatically oxidized by oxygen in the air when they are kept open
 is rasinic kriya ke falswaroop un padaartho main kuch avaanchhneeya gundharm aa jate hai, jo unako saadhaaran upyog ke liye anupyukt kar dete hai
 Many such changes are realized by ordinary senses
 at: swat: oxikaran dwaara padaartho ke bighad jane tathaa adhik dinon tak surakshit rakhane kaa gyaan manushya ko bahut dinon se tha yadhyapi 'swat: oxikaran' kii kriya kaa purna gyaan kaaphi baad main ho paaya
 The process of automatic oxidation takes place in four terms: praarambhik pad jo bahut hi mand gati se ghatit hota he, Accelerating speed respectively, lagbhag sthaayee gati tathaa Last loss-oriented motion
 pratham pad tathaa duusare pad kii mand gati tak kii jo avadhi hoti he use praren avadhi kehete hai or yah is baat ko pradarshit karata he
 This confirms the oxidation reaction process based on the chain reaction
 swat: oxikaran prakriya main shrunkhalaavahak kaa kaam muktamulak karte hai jo bahut hi sakriy hote hai
 They are formed by breakdown of the weakest carbon – hydrogen bond in the molecule that is self oxidized
 at: is prakaar ke padaarth main aasaani se nikal janevaale ek hydrogen parmaanu kii upasthiti aavashyak he
 In addition, it should also have a binary with which the free radical can be combined
 yadhyapi oxikaran abhikriyaayein jivan ke liye ati mahatvapoornan hai, ve hanikaarak bhi ho sakati hai
 Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which initiate chain reactions that damage cells
 pratioxikaarak padaarth swayan in mukt mulkon se oxikrut ho jate hai jisase shrunkhlaa abhikriya ko todane main madad milti he
 Taxes inhibit these chain reactions that occur on cells
 atev praayah antioxident ridusing agents hote hai, jaise thaol, escorbic amla yaa poliphinol aadi
 a complex system of manufacture and collection of various types of antioxidants is found in plants and animals
 inamen glutathion,, vitamin-si, vitamin-i, anzime aadi aate hai
 Inadequate amounts of antioxidants or the destruction of antioxidant enzymes cause oxidative stress that can cause damage or death of cells
 aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki oxikar tanaav hi anekon rogon kaa kaaran he
 Therefore, in pharmacology, antibiotics are intensively studied, especially for trauma and neurodegenerative diseases
 oxikar tanaav rogon kaa kaaran bhi he or parinaam bhi
 Antioxidants are used extensively as a complementary food
 pratioxikaarak adhikansh carbonic yogic, jaise aromatic amin, finol, emino finol aadi hote hai jo saralata se hydrogen parmaanu nikaalkar muktamulak main parinat ho saken or shrunkhalit kriya kaa prasaaran kar saken
 Antioxidants are automatically destroyed while doing their work, or substances which are automatically oxidized, respectively
 rabar, gasoline tathaa snehak tel aadi kuch padaartho main to pratioxikaarak swat: vidyaman rahete hai par unke shodhan ke samay ve nasht ho jate hai
 Therefore, care has to be taken that they are not destroyed or after refining they have to get more antioxidants

 Depending on the specific institution, a medical peer review may be accessed by request of the patient or physician or insurance carrier
 shabd "samakaksh samiksha" moolyankan pradarshan ke paryaayavachi ke rup main istamaal kiya jaataa he
 The first documented account of the peer-review process is in the Ethics of the Physician, written by Ishaq bin Ali Al Rahwi of al-rahya
 unke kaam, saath hi baad ke arabi chikitsa minial, yah vyakt karte hai ki har atithi chikitsak hameshaa har yatra ke sambandh main marij kii haalat ke note kii pratyalipi banani chahie

 agar unki samiksha nakaaratmak hoti, to abhyaas chikitsak par mariz dwaara mukadmaa kiya ja saktaa he
 The objective of the medical peer review committee is to examine the medical care so that it can be determined whether the standards of care have been accepted 
 Professional or personal conduct of a physician or other health care professional may also be investigated
 yadi chikitsa samakaksh samiksha samiti paati he ki chikitsak maanakon se vichlit hai, tab yah simit us chikitsak ke visheshadhikaro ko simit yaa samaapt karne kii sifarish kar sakati hai
 Measures including remedial education can also be recommended
 aspataalon main, keval chikitsiye karmchaariyon dwaara adhikrut sahakarmi samiksha ke paas chikitsak ke visheshadhikaar ko simit karne kaa adhikaar hai
 Committees organized by the hospital administration or other group within the hospital may make disciplinary recommendations for medical staff

 Nursing and other health professionals also need to participate in peer review
 nursing main, anya vyavsaayon ke tarah, samakaksh samiksha ek anivaary hissaa he abhyaas par peshewar niyantran ko banaae rakhane ke liye or ek aisi prakriya he jiskaa istamaal peshewar apni sevaaon ko saarvajanik or sanghathan ke prati javabdeh rakhane ke liye karte hai
 The equivalent review is reassuring quality outcomes, promoting practice development and plays an essential role in maintaining professional autonomy
 ek peshewar hone ke naate swa niyaman or samakaksh samiksha main shaamil hona ek aavashyaktaa he
 Equivalent reviews are defined by the American Nurses Association Guidelines as a process by which the same rank, occupation, assesses performance against each other's established standards
 ye darshan un peshewaro ko, jo us kaary kii zaruuraton or maango se parichit ho, ek aise pad par rakhata he jaha ve pratikriya pranali ko de or grahan karte hai
 The State Medical Board conducts peer review of licensed professionals
 kuch rajyon main, board keval chikitsakon se bana hota hai, anya rajyon main medical board main vakeelon or anya gaiyr chikitsakon ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa hai
 Physicians are part of the board in core advisory capacities
 is sanrachana ke tahat, medical board samiti jo board salaahkaar namika kaa hissaa ho bhi saktaa he yaa nahin bhi, se chikitsa samakaksh samiksha kii maang karata hai
 Other state boards are run primarily by state physicians
 in rajyon main, samakaksh samiksha samitiya puri tarah board sadasyon dwaara kii ja sakati he, yaa board ke saath asambandhit chikitsakon ke ek panel dwaara chuni samiti dwaara kii ja sakati hai
 Decisions involving physician licensure are recommended to the Medical Equivalent Review Board, which may be accepted or rejected by the board
 vivaad he ki chikitsa samakaksh samiksha kaa chikitsakon, aspataalon, ech
em
ou or anya sansthaaon ke dwaara pratispardhaa ke hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa hai
 This endemic abuse is considered by the review to be a "show off by what the peer referred to" and they allege that the 1986 HCQIA construction data bank facilitated national misuse of the practitioner, such as a 'third rail' or 'first to make the strike' Attempt to protect patients instead of a mentality

 In response to the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1987, officials of national medical associations and health care organizations formed a non-profit corporation to provide independent assessments of medical and care quality by eminent physicians
 The American Medical Foundation Physician and Medical Staff for Peer Review and Education provide equivalent review, specialty department evaluation and quality of the entire hospital assessment for care at 2,000 nationwide community and educational hospitals

 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha

 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di

 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person

 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 Private international law refers to the rules that are chosen by a state to decide promises that contain a foreign element
 in niyamon kaa prayog is prakaar ke vaad vishyon ke nirnay main hota he jinka prabhaav kisi aise tathy, ghatana athwa sanvyavhaar par padataa he jo kisi anya deshiy vidhi pranali se is prakaar sambhddha he ki us pranali kaa avlamban aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The name 'private international law' implies that this subject is a branch of international law
 parantu vastutah aisa he nahin
 There is no reciprocity in private international law and public international law
 roman samrajya main ve sabhi paristhitiyaan vidyaman thim jinamein antarrashtriya kanoon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 But the books do not give a complete idea of how they were managed in the Roman legal system
 rome rajya ke patan ke pashchaat sweey vidhi kaa yug aayaa jo praayah 10veen shatabdi ke ant tak rahaa
 Thereafter a separate territorial law system was born
 13veen shatabdi main nijee antarrashtriya kanoon ko nishchit ruparekha dene ke liye aavashyak niyam banane kaa bharpoor praytn italy main hua
 The 16th-century French jurists formulated the constitutional principle and used it in every law rule
 vartmaan yug main nijee antarrashtriya kanoon teen pramukh pranaaliyon main vibhakt ho gaya- Private international law is based on the element that there are many different legal systems in the world which are mostly different from each other in terms of the rules governing the various legal relations of life
 yadhyapi yah thik he ki apane nijee desh main prayek shaasha sampurna-prabhutv-sampann he or desh ke prayek vyakti tathaa vastu par uskaa anany kshetradhikaar he, phir bhi sabhyataa ke vartmaan yug main vyaavhaarik drushti se yah sambhav nahin he ki anyadeshiy kanoonon kii avhelnaa kii ja sake
 Often occasions come when it becomes imperative for a court of jurisdiction to uphold the justice system of another country in order to prevent injustice and protect inherent rights
 anyadeshiy kanoon tathaa videshi tatv–nijee antarrashtriya kanoon ke prayojan ke liye anyadeshiy kanoon se taatpary kisi bhi aise bhugolic kshetra kii nyaay pranali se he jisaki seemaa ke baahar us kshetra kaa sthaneey kanoon prayog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 It is clear that the purpose of justice will be incomplete by the neglect of foreign law
 udaahranarth, jab kisi desh main vidhi dwaara praapt adhikaar kaa vivaad duusare desh ke nyaayalay main prastut hota he tab vaadi ko raksha pradaan karne ke purv nyaayalay ke liye yah jaananaa nitant aavashyak hota he ki amuk adhikaar kis prakaar kaa he
 This can be known only if the court examines the justice system of the country under which that right is obtained
 vivaadon main videshi tatv anek roopon main prakat hote hai
 Some examples are as follows: jab vibhinn pakshon main se koi paksh anya raashtra kaa ho athwa uski naagarikta videshi ho; When a businessman is declared insolvent in one country and his creditors are in unjust countries; jab vaad kisi aisi sampatti ke vishay main ho jo us nyaayalay ke pradeshy kshetradhikaar main na hokar anyaay deshon main sthit ha
 Private international law varies from country to country

 Similarly, English and American rules, despite being very similar, are completely different from each other in many subjects

 This asymmetry can be overcome in two ways
 pehla upaay yah he ki vibhinn deshon kii vidhi pranaaliyon main yathasambhav samarupata sthapit kii jaae; doosraa yah ki nijee antarrashtriya kanoon kaa ekikaran ho
 Many efforts were made in this direction but special success could not be achieved

 The main characters of this film are Munna and Circuit which was also in its first part Munna Bhai MBBS
 'lage raho munna bhai' aage kii 21ve sadi ke shuruuaat ke bharatiyon ke soch se judi hui kahani he
 It attempts to give a heart-touching message with a fountain of laughter
 munna ek gunda he or prasiddh radio jocky jahnavi kii aawaaj kaa divaana he
 Munna's life has become beautiful
 uskaa dadagiri kaa dhandha acha chal rahaa he or vah roj ghanton radio sunata he
 
 Dreams of marriage with Jahanvi

 Jahnavi considers Munna a professor of history and one day naively calls Munna to lecture history in her family
 ab bechaara munna kya kare? bas iske alaava sab kuch thik chal rahaa he ab munna ko is baat kaa hal chahie
 The circuit comes with a new idea and then a unique incident happens in Munna's life
 vah mahatma gandhi se pratyaksh rup se miltaa he
 However, it is later learned that Munna feels this
 boman irani kaa paatr ek chaalaak vyakti hai jo jahnavi ke bhawan ko hadapna chahta he
 This film has given a new word to the Hindi language Gandhigiri which is nowadays on the tongue of every common and special
 vaise to is shabd ko lekar khaasaa vivaad bhi hua he or yah swaabhaavik bhi he kyonki giri pratyay kii vyanjana pritikar nahin hoti
 But a very serious subject like Gandhi's idea has been presented in a very light-hearted and entertaining style in it, and that too without the slightest seriousness of the subject, it is a great feature
