 Western Europe dominated the musical development since 1400 - in fact, the most prominent changes occurred during the Renaissance period
 In addition to singing or dancing, the instruments served for other purposes and the performers used them as solo instruments
 keyboard or tamboore, polifonic upkarnon ke rup main viksit hue or sangeetkaaron ne adhik unnat tablechar kaa upyog karke jatil rachanaaon kaa vikaas kiya
 Musicians began to design musical pieces for specific instruments
 solahavin sadi ke baad ke aadhe samay main, vibhinn upkarnon ke liye sangeet lekhan kii ek vidhi ke rup main vaadyavrindkaran ek aam abhyaas ho gaya
 Where individual artists had judged themselves, musicians now applied instrumentation
 lokapriy sangeet main polifonic style kaa prabhutv rahaa or upkaran nirmaataaon ne tadnusaar pratikriya di
 Beginning in around 1400, the rate of development of musical instruments increased enormously as compositions required more dynamic sounds
 logon ne vaadyayantron ke nirmaan, vaadan or soochibaddh karne ke bare main pustak likhnaa shuru kiya; aisi pehali kitaab sebstian phiradung kii 1511 granth Musica getuscht und angezogen thi 
 phiradung kii kriti ko vishesh rup se isliye bhi purna mana jaataa he kyonki usne "aniyamit" upkarnon kaa vivaran bhi shaamil kiya he jaise shikari kii sing or gaay kii ghantiyaan, haalanki phiradung ne inaki aalochana bhi kii he
 Later came other books, including Arnold Schlick's Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten that same year
 This book is a treatise on organ formation and organ recitation
 punarjagran kaal main prakashit, anudeshaatmak pustakon or sandarbhon main se, ek pustak ko hawa or taar vaale sabhi vaadya ke vistrut vivaran or chithran ke liye vikhyath he jisamen unka tulanaatmak aakaar diya gaya he
 This book by Michael Praetorius, Syntagma Musicum, is considered an official reference to sixteenth-century instruments
 solahavin sadi main, vaadyayantra nirmaataaon ne adhikansh upkarnon ko jo "shastreey akritiyaan" deen, vah aaj bhi chal rahi he, jaise vaayalin
 swaroop saundarya par bhi dhyaan diya jane laga - shrota ek vaadyayantra ke rup saundarya se utane hi mugdh hote the jitna uski dhwani se
 isliye, nirmaataaon ne saamagree or kaarigari par vishesh dhyaan diya or vaadyayantra sangrahalayon or gharon main sangrahntiya ban gaye
 It was during this period that the producers began to produce the same type of instruments in different sizes to cater to the needs of musical associations, the group that played the composition written for groups of these instruments
 yantra nirmaataaon ne aise gunon ko viksit kiya jo aaj bhi chal rahe hai
 For example, when multi-keyboard organisms were present, single-stop organisms emerged in the early fifteenth century
 These pauses were meant to produce an amalgam of rhythms, a development that was essential to the complexity of music of the time
 suvahyata main sudhaar karne ke liye turahiyon ko unhen aaj ke aadhunik swaroop main viksit kiya gaya or chambar sangeet main mishran karne ke liye vadak mut kaa istemaal karte the
 From the beginning of the seventeenth century musicians began to produce compositions of a more passionate style
 unhen laga ki ek monophonic style, bhaavnaatmak sangeet ke adhik anukool he or unhone un vaadyayantron ke liye sangeet ke tukade likhe jo maanav kii gayan dhwani ke poorak hote the
 As a result, many such devices, which were incapable of wide range and maneuverability and due to which they were seen as soulless, fell out of the choice
 aisa hi ek vaadya tha obo
 jhuke hue upkaran jaise vaayalin, viola, baritone or vibhinn tamboore kaa lokapriy sangeet main prabhutv bana rahaa
 Starting around 1750, Tambara disappeared from musical compositions due to the increasing popularity of guitars
 tarayukt vaadyavrund kii vyapaktaa main vruddhi ke saath, unhen sunne kii ekresata kii pratikriya swaroop, hawa vaale vaadya jaise bansuri, obo or basoon kii taraf punah rujhaan badha
 In the mid-seventeenth century, the instrument called the hunter's horn was converted into an "artistic instrument" and added a longer tube, a finite bore, a wider bell, and a wider range
 is badlaav ke vivaran aspasht hai, lekin aadhunik sing yaa or adhik aam bhashaa main, francisi sing, 1725 tak ubhari
 ek slide trumpet kaa janm hua, yah ek parivartit rup tha jisamen ek lanbaa mouthpis tha jo andar or baahar sarakta tha, jisase vadak ko pich main anant samaayojan kaa avasar miltaa tha
 This variant of the trumpet remained unpopular due to the difficulty involved in its playing
 barok avadhi main, organ main taan sambandhit parivartan hue, chunki landan ke abraham jordan jaise nirmaataaon ne tehraav ko adhik arthpurna banaaya or kuch upkaran jode jaise arthpurna pedal
 sacks ne is pravriti ko organ kii saamaanya dhwani ke "patan" ke rup main dekha
 There are many different ways to classify instruments
 sabhi tareekon main upkaran ke bhautik gunon, vaadyayantra par sangeet kaise pradarshit kiya jaataa he or orcestra yaa anya sangeet-samoohon main vaadya kii sthiti ke kuch sangyojan kii jaanch kii jaati he
 Some methods arise as a result of disagreements between experts about how instruments should be classified
 jabaki vargeekaran pranali kaa puraa surveykshan karnaa is lekh ke daayre se pare he, pramukh pranaaliyon kaa ek saransh nimna he
 An ancient system, which dates back to at least the 1st century BC
 Coming from, the instruments are divided into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by moving strings; Instruments where sound is produced by the vibrations of air segments; Percussion instruments made of wood or metal; And leather-faced percussion instruments or drums
 victor-charles Mahillon later, adopted a very similar system
 He was the patron of the musical collection at the Conservatoire in Brussels and divided the instruments into four groups for the 1888 catalog of collections; Stringed instruments, howling instruments, percussion instruments and drums
 erik won hornbostel or court sacks ne baad main pracheen paddati ko liya or 1914 main Zeitschrift für Ethnologie main vargeekaran ke liye ek vyapak nai yojana prakashit kii
 His method is widely used today and is often referred to as the Hornbostel – Sachs method
 mul sacks-hornbostel paddati ne vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya samoohon main vargeekrut kiya: Sachs later added a fifth class, electrophones, such as the thermines, which produce sounds electronically
 prayek varg ke bheetar kai up-samooh hai
 The system was criticized and revised in previous years, but it is widely used by organologists and ethnomusicologists only
 andre shafnar, Musée de l'homme ke sangrakshak, sacks-hornbostel pranali se asahmat the or unhone 1932 main apni khud kii pranali viksit kii
 Schaffner believed that the classification of an instrument should determine its anatomy rather than its method of playing
 unki paddati ne vaadyayantron ko do virgon main baanta: aise vaadya jinka sharir thos or kampan yukt he or aise vaadya jinamein compit hawa hoti he
 Western instruments, too, are often classified by their musical range when compared with other instruments of the same family
 in shabdaawaliyon ko gayan kii awaz ke vargeekaran ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he: Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello can be considered either a tenor or a bass, depending on how its music fits into the group and can be trombone alto, tenor
 , Or bass and French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on which range it is played on
 saanchaa:vocal and instrumental pitch ranges Many instruments have range, as part of their name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, alto flute, bass flute, alto recorder, bass guitar, etc
 atirikt visheshan, sopraano range se upar yaa baas se neeche ke vaadya kaa varnan karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye: sopraanino sexophone, kontrabas clerinet
 When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the range of instruments in comparison to other instruments in their family and not in the range of human voices or instruments of other families
 For example, a bass flute has a range from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays down an octave
 vaadya yantra kaa nirmaan ek vishesh vyavsaay he jiske liye varshon kaa prashikshan, abhyaas or kabhi-kabhi ek prashikshu banane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most manufacturers of instruments specialize in one style of instrumentation, for example, a luthear makes only stringed instruments
 kuch nirmaataa keval ek prakaar ke vaadya banaate hai jaise piano
 Regardless of how the sound is produced in the instrument, many instruments have a keyboard as the user interface
 kunjeepatal vaadyayantra, aise vaadyayantra hai jinhen jinhen ek sangeet kunjeepatal dwaara bajaayaa jaataa he
 Each key produces one or more sounds; In most keyboard instruments, there are additional means to fluctuate these sounds
 They can produce sound by moving or pumping air, by pushing or pulling the moving wires, by electronic means, or in some other way
 Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the Gloukenspiel, have a keyboard attached to them
 haalanki unamem koi chalyman hissaa nahin hota he or unhen vadak ke haathon main pakade gaye mallett se bajaayaa jaataa he, unamem kunjiyon kii samaan bhautik vyavastha hoti he or ve samaan tareeke se dhwani tarange utpann karte hai

 marshall ke shishy jaan menard keens kaa 'rojgaar, byaaj evam mudra kaa saamaanya siddhant' naamak granth arthshaastra kii vishesh mahatvapurn pustak he
 In fact, this book has completely changed the ideology of Western economists
 isi par herad domer kaa suprasiddh vikaas model, liyontif kaa in-put output model aadi kai mahatvapurn siddhant udbhoot hue hai
 Prof
 Samuel Simonson believes that no individual or economist once returned to old ideologies after being influenced by Keynes's analysis
 keens ke prabhaav ke kaaran hi unke purvavarti aalochak bhi unke samarthak ho gaye
 He was very forthright and that is why his economic views were settled
 unhone vyaavhaarik kshetra main bhi yathesht yogadan diya tha
 He has been an active contributor to the founding of New Deal of America, International Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development etc
 keens vyashti arthshaastra ke janmdata rahe hai
 That is why his treatise 'general Theory' became so popular
 vaise bhi is granth main unhone vyapak aarthik vishleshan ko spasht kiya
 He gave economics the principle of total income and effective demand
 unke anusaar rojgaar prabhavi maang par nirbhar karata he
 Effective demand depends on self-use and appropriation
 upbhog kaa nirdhaaran aay ke aakaar or samaaj kii upbhog pravriti ke anusaar hota he
 Therefore, if employment is to increase, both consumption and appropriation should increase
 keens ne marshall, pigu, fisher dwaara di gai aay kii sthitik paribhaashaon main se kisi ko bhi sweekaar nahin kiya kyonki keens ken anusaar ve un tatwon par koi prakaash nahin daalatin jo kisi vishesh samay main arthvyavastha main rojgaar or aay ke str ko nirdhaarit karte hai
 Keynes first defined national income in a way that would help him determine employment in society
 marshall ke mulya siddhant kaa aadhaar jis prakaar 'keemat' he, vaise hi keens ke rojgaar siddhant kaa aadhaar 'aay' he
 According to him, there will be 'total income = total utilization + total appropriation'
 unhone 'rashtriya aay' ke hetu kaha ki chunki 'aay=upyog+bachat tathaa 'vyay = upbhog + viniyog' he, isliye 'upyog + bachat = upbhog + viniyog' yaa 'bachat=viniyog' ke hoga
 Keynes's income analysis tells us that in order to protect the economy from huge fluctuations, it is necessary to maintain equality between savings and appropriation
 mandi kaaleen kuprabhavon ko dur karne ke liye keens ne sasti mudraniti, saarvajanik nirmaan kaary or dhan ke uchit bantwaare se upbhog pravriti main vruddhi ke liye sarkari vyay evam nitiyon kii sahaayta kii he
 Keynes's principle applies more to developed countries and less to underdeveloped countries
 parantu yadi alpaviksit deshon main bhi prabhavi maang or bachat utpann ho sake to keens kaa arthshaastra vahaan par bhi lagu ho saktaa he
 In fact, in view of the unemployment, recession, price rise, etc
 of the present world, it would be appropriate to follow Keynes's policies firmly and surely most influenced by Keynes's principles

 After lying in political hibernation for three years, GNLF chief Subhash Ghisingh announced that his party would contest the 2011 election of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly
 Subhash Ghisingh returned to Darjeeling after three years of "exile" ahead of India's 8 April 2011 assembly elections on 9 April 2011
 All three GNLF Darjeeling, and Pemu Chhetri lost the election held on 18 April 2011 sanatani panth ke anuyaayiyon ne san 1672 main aurangzeb ke viruddh ek vidroh kiya tha
 Persian historian Khafi Khan writes about this rebellion that a pawn of Shikdar in Narnaul beheaded a Satnami farmer with sticks
 ise satnamiyon ne atyaachaar ke rup main liya or us sainik ko maar daalaa
 Shikdar sent a contingent to arrest the Satnamis, but was defeated
 satnamiyon ne ise apane dharm ke viruddh akraman samajha or unhone badshaah ke viruddh vidroh kii ghoshnaa kar di
 He killed the Faujdar of Narnaul and established his independent power and started collecting revenue from the people there
 din-par-din hinsa badhati gayi
 Meanwhile, the surrounding zamindars and Rajput chieftains took advantage of the opportunity and seized the revenue
 jab aurangzeb ko is baghaavat kii khabar mili, to usne raja bishen singh, hamid khan or kuch mogul saradaaron ke prayaas se kai hajaar vidrohi satnamiyon ko marava diya, jo bache ve bhaag gayi

 a good example of this type of risk-free loan is the US Treasury Securities, which produces the lowest returns available in economics, but investors are comforted with certain expectations that the US Treasury will not default in its debt instrument
 The risk-free rate is also commonly used to determine the floating interest rates, which is usually calculated by adding the bonus to the lender based on the risk-free interest rate and the creditworthiness of the lender
 In fact, no debt is truly "risk-free", but defaulters in "risk-free" rate of return are much less likely to default

 Loans allow individuals and organizations to do whatever they are otherwise unable to do or are not allowed
 Generally, in industrialized nations, people use it to buy houses, cars and many other things which due to being very expensive, they are not able to buy with the available cash money
 Companies also use debt in many ways to effect investment in their assets so that their return of equity is effective
 This effect, the ratio of debt to equity, is considered important in determining the risk of investment; The more debt on each equity, the more risky it will be
 This increased risk for both companies and individuals can lead to weak results, as the cost of debt care may exceed the ability to pay due to external events or internal difficulties

 This excessive debt, coupled with excessive anticipation on future returns, was accompanied by asset bubbles in the stock market
 When the expectation was improved, currency deflation and credit crunch began
 Currency deflation effectively made debt more expensive and, as Fisher explained, it re-effected currency deflation because in order to reduce their debt levels, economic agents reduced their consumption and investment
 Lack of demand reduced business activity and created more unemployment
 In a more direct sense, both inflation has also led to greater bankruptcy due to increased debt costs and reduced demand

 adhik vyapak anupaalan or naitikta kaarykram ke rup main kai companiyon ne aantarik maamalon main karmchaariyon ke naitik aacharan se sambandhit nitiyaan taiyaar kii hai
 These policies may be in the form of a general address to the board, which are presented in very generalized language, or it may also be elaborate policies that have special palliative requirements
 They are usually meant to identify the company's expectations of workers and to guide them in solving some or more of the ethical problems faced by doing business
 aashaa kii jaati he ki aisi niti ke kaaran vyapak naitik jaagarukta paidaa hogi, unke upyog main sthirataa aayegi or naitik aapadaaon se dur rahane main madad milegi
 Along with the increasing number of companies, there is a need for employees who attend seminars related to business operations, often discussing company policies, special case studies, and legal requirements

 Most policymakers suggest an ethics policy to succeed, which is as follows: aachaar adhikariyon kii sanghathanon dwaara aupchaarik rup se niyukti 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main kii gayi
 a catalyst to this new role is a series of scams involving fraud, corruption, and misuse that afflicted America's defense industry at the time
 iske kaaran raksha udyog pahal kaa gathan hua, jo sabhi udyogon main naitik vyavsaay prathaon ko badhaava dene or unhen sunishchit karne kii pahal thi
 DII initially set standards for ethics management for companies
 In 1991 the Association of Ethics and Compliance Officers - originally the Association of Ethics Officers - was established in the Center for Business Ethics as a professional organization for those responsible for management So that they can know ethical best practices
 Membership grew rapidly and was soon established as an independent organization
 Was installed companiyon ke liye ek anya mahatvapurn kaary naitikta / anupaalan adhikari kii niyukti karne kaa faisla tha, jiske liye sanghathanon ke liye sangheey dand dishanirdesh 1991 kii manjuuri aavashyak thi, jo us pratishthan ke liye maanak tay karata tha tathaa jiske paas sangheey aparaadh kaa doshi paye jane par sajaa main chhot ke liye aavedan karnaa padataa tha
 However, there were significant results in assisting judges in sentencing and helping to establish best practices with their influence

 Similarly, in another case related to this trend, the appointment of risk assessment officers was initiated, which monitors how the shareholder's investment may be influenced by the company's decision
 bazaar main naitik adhikariyon kaa prabhaav spasht nahin he
 If the appointment is made primarily as a response to legal requirements, then it should be accepted that its effect will be minimal, at least, for the short term
 In short, the result of ethical business behavior derives from the importance of consistent ethical behavior in a corporate culture, a culture and environment that typically emanates from above in the establishment
 keval naitikta kii sthiti kii nigaraanee kii sthapana naitik vyavhaar ke liye prerit karne liye aparyaapt he, uske liye pramukh prabandhan se lagaataar samarthan praapt pranaligat kaarykram aavashyak he

 Business philosophy is also associated with questions such as what are the social responsibilities of business, business management theory, theory of individualism versus collectivism; The role of free will, self-interest among market participants; The invisible hand principle, the requirements of social justice and natural rights, especially property rights in relation to business enterprise

 fari nrity yaa ahirau nrity The Ahirs have been a combative and nomadic caste since their early days
 jiskaa mul pesha pashupaalan or charvaahee rahaa he
 Like the way of life of the Gujars of the mountainous areas, the Ahirs also grazed animals in the early period and crossed the boundaries of the village area
 pashuchaaran ke kaaran bhaag-daud, uchhal-kud, pahalwani or lathi chalaane jaise shramshil kaary inhen karne pade
 The nature of labor determined their life structure and elements of entertainment
 yadhyapi ki har kshetra ke ahiron kaa kaam pashuchaaran hi rahaa phir bhi sthaan vishesh kii pravritiyon kii bhinnata ke kaaran chhattisgadhi yadavon main janma `raut naach ́ kii style, bhojpuri kshetra ke yadavon main na aa saki
 Two types of dance styles originated here: the jaundice dance and the furry or furuvahi dance
 in donon hi shaileyon main gayaki ke rup main mulat: birahaa ko hi apanaaya gaya
 Thus the birha is purely the song of the Ahirs and the underpants and the furry Ahiru dance
 jaanghia or fari, donon nrityon main kalakaaron kii kad-lathi kii majbootee, paanvon kii chapaltaa dekhte hi banati he
 Undergarments are worn on the thigh in the jangiya dance, in which the strings of the ghungro, kadamalayas, mridang / nakara are synchronized to the sound of both mind and body
 mukhya gayak ke saath kores gayakon kii team or nritykaron kii chapaltaa shrotaaon ko mugdh kar detii he
 Furi is also basically a dance of the Ahir class
 isamen nakkaara kaa prayog to hota hi he, lohe ke vajani phaalon kaa bhi prayog vaadyayantra ke rup main adbhut bhang se kiya jaataa he
 Two furs are held in each palm, which are collided in such a way that the listener becomes shocked
 isliye ise fari yaa faruwahi nrity kehete hai
 Here it must also be made clear that in furry dance, besides ghungroo, phar, nakkara, kartal is also used
 nritykar ek haath main kartaal bajaate hai
 In this dance, the performers jump, dance and go far and return, changing the footsteps at the sound of the knuckle
 kabhi-kabhi jameen par tarah-tarah ke kartab bhi dikhaate hai
 Actually, furry dance also has two parts
 pratham bhaag main team ke sadsy lohe ke pharon ko bajaate hue birahaa gayaki karte hai or nakkaare kii badalati dhvaniyon par kadam taal dhimaa or tej kar naachte-gaate rahete hai
 Singing is the responsibility of the members playing the farce, while the dancing, jumping and jumping dance is not such a situation that they can support in singing
 unka dam phool chukaa hota he
 They become sweaty
 unki qamar kii lachak, kadamtal or paanv main bandhe ghunghruon kii khanak maahaul ko utsahit kar detii he
 The dancers, who are in the male attire, follow the sound of the knuckle, changing footsteps, jumping, dancing
 fari nrity ke duusare bhaag main gayaki ko roak kar keval nrity ko sthaan diya jaataa he
 In this stage the playing of the fars is stopped but the knuckle keeps ringing
 nakkaare kii aawaaj ke saath taal milakar nritykar sarkas jaise shaareerik kartab bhi dikhaate hai
 Such as diving in the air, turning over, offering seven to eight people on your body or bullock cart on yourself or throwing bricks on the chest etc
 fari nrity main in donon prakaaron kaa prayog baari-baari se kiya jaataa he jisase darshakon ko vishay parivartan kaa anand miltaa rahe
 Actually, the dance part is included at the end of one song and the beginning of another
 khadi birahaa khadey hokar hi gaaya jaataa he isliye fari nrity or gayaki ke sabhi sadsy khadey hokar hi is vidha ko prastut karte hai
 The modern birha, which is sung in furi dance, is a combined form of Charkadiya birha and lorki singing
 bahudhaa birahaa gayaki main gaathatmak geet hi gaaye jate hai
 Although the influence of the film songs has seen some changes in birha singing and the furry singers have often used folk Bhojpuri songs in their singing, but birha are only narrative songs based on a different story
 Huh
 inamen puranic, aitihaasik or duusare chamatkaarik kathaon ko bhi sthaan de diya jaataa he
 Most birha singers sing religious passages prominently

 With regard to Buddhist history, the remains of that time in Bundelkhand are clear that there was no significant change in the condition of Bundelkhand during this period

 itihaas sakshi he ki bharat kii aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut kii chhavnee main bhadki thi
 But there is a truth missing behind these historical facts, that 15 years before the war of independence, Meerut started a revolution in Dharmanagri Chitrakoot of Bundelkhand
 pavitra mandakini ke kinare gokshi ke khilaaf ekajute hui hindu-muslim birdari ne mau tehsil main adaalat lagaakar paanch firangi afasaron ko faansee par lataka diya
 After this, whenever the British or any of their hangers tried to cheat in the pride of the Bundelas, they were beheaded

 The 'ghaghra platoon' of Burkhanshini women was also instrumental in taking forward the tales of struggle
 aazaadee ke sangharsh kii pehali mashaal sulgaane vaale bundelkhand ke ranbankure itihaas ke pannon main jagah nahin paa sake, lekin unki shoorveerta kii tasdik firangi afasar khud kar gayi hai
 There is a story buried in the Banda Gazette written by the British authorities, which is known by very few people
 gajetir ke panne palatney par maaloom hua ki varsh 1857 main meerut kii chhavnee main firangiyon kii fouj ke sipaahi mangal pandeya ke vidroh se bhi 15 saal pehle chitrakoot main kranti kii chingaari bhadak chuki thi
 Actually, British officers used to slaughter cows on the banks of the holy Mandakini river in Dharmanagari at that time of the past
 gaumance ko bihar or bengal main bhejkar vahaan se evaj main rasad or hathiyaar mangaye jate the
 The local people were distracted by the killing of a second faith, ie the cow dynasty, on the banks of Mandakini, a symbol of faith, but the tongue was closed due to the fear of the Firangi
 kuch logon ne himmat dikhaate hue maratha shaskaon or mandakini paar ke ‘nayaa gaanv’ ke choube raajaaon se fariyaad lagaayi, lekin donon shaskaon ne angrejon kii mukhaalafat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The request went in vain, as a result a flame of vengeance flared inside the chest

 Then on the sixth day of June in the year 1842, he did not expect any
 hajaaron kii sankhya main nihathe mazdooron, naujavaanon or burkanashin mahilaon ne mau tehsil ko gherkar firangiyon ke saamne baghawat ke naare buland kiye
 The special thing was that hindu-muslim fraternity had equal participation in this movement against Gaukashi

 After seeing the British officers were hostage, after this, a 'public court' was put under the tree and five British officers were hanged after trial

 On this decree, Panna Naresh sent a thousand soldiers, a cannon, four elephants and fifty bulls, the queen of Chhatarpur and the king of Gaurihar as well as the army of the king of Ajaygarh had also traveled to Chitrakoot
 duusari ore banda chhavnee main dubake firangi afasaron ne banda nawab se jaan kii guhaar lagaate hue bivi-bacchon ke saath pahunch gayi
 Here to suppress the rebellion, all the soldiers of the army of Indian kings who reached banda-chitrakoot started to step in with the agitators
 nattejey main utsaahi krantikariyon ne 15 june ko banda chhavnee ke prabharee mi

 After this, to end the awe of the British from inside Awam, roam the streets of Banda with a severed head
 kakrel kii hatya ke do din baad rajapur, mau, banda, darsenda, tarauhaan, badausa, baberu, pailaani, simauni, sihunda ke bundelon ne yuddh parishad kaa gathan karte hue bundelkhand ko aaazaad ghoshit kar diya
 Convener of "bundelkhand Unified Party" Sanjay Pandey says that when the British officers themselves have written about this revolution, then why did Indian historians not give these facts a place in the pages of history? When asked the truth it was a real mass movement Because there was no leader in it but the general public was the agitator, so it is not possible to ignore the struggle of the Bundelas to find a place in history
