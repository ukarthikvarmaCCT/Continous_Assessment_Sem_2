 There are two forts in Palamu which have become somewhat dilapidated at the present time, but these are the pride of the region even today and the major attraction center for tourists

 These fortifications are the product of the kings of the Chiro dynasty
 is kile ko raja medini raay ne banwaaya tha
 Shahpur Fort, located on the banks of the river Koel in the south direction of Palinam's headquarters Medininagar, stands in a state of disrepair, containing memories of hundreds of years of history
 sthaneey log is kile ko 'chalaani kila' bhi kehate hai
 According to history, it was built by the Chero dynasty king Gopal Rai around 1766–1770 and the kingdom of Palamu was governed from here during the period of the decline of Chero power
 san 1771 main palamu kila par angrejon ke akraman or niyantranaadhin hone ke baad shahpur kila hi raja kaa nivas sthaan bana
 It is said that a secret route in the form of a tunnel from this fort went to the Palamu Fort
 is kile main chero vansh ke antim shaasha raja chudaaman raay or unki patni chandravati devi kii pratimaa sthapit kii gai he
 This fort located on the Shahpur main road can provide a breathtaking natural view of the Medininagar area, including the Koyal river
 kuch varsh purv is kile ko puratathvik mahatv kaa ghoshit kiya gaya hai lekin iske baavjood bhi yah cherovansheey samrajya ke vaibhavshaalee itihaas kaa mook sakshi apni durdasha par sisakata najar aata he
 Qutbuddin Aibak was a ruler in Central India, the first Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate and the founder of the Ghulam dynasty
 usne keval chaar varsh hi shashan kiya
 He was a very talented soldier who became an assistant to the military operations of Muhammad Ghori, the Sultan of the Ghori Empire first and then the Sultan of Delhi
 qutub al deen turkistan kaa nivasee tha or uske mata pita turk the
 The slave trade was prevalent in the region at that time and was considered profitable
 daason ko uchit shiksha or prashikshan dekar unhen raja ke haath farokht karnaa ek laabhadaayi dhandha tha
 The child Qutubuddin became a victim of this system and was sold to a businessman
 vyapaaree ne use fir nishapur ke kaazi fakhruddin abdul azeez kufi ko bech diya
 Abdul Aziz gave the child Qutub with his son military and religious training
 par abdul azeez kii mrityu ke baad uske putron ne use fir se bech diya or antat use mohammad gori ne kareed liya
 Muhammad Ghori, impressed by the courage, devotion and loyalty of Qutubuddin Aibak, appointed him the president of the royal stables
 yah ek sammanit pad tha or usne sainya abhiyaanon main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila
 After defeating Prithviraj Chauhan in the Second Battle of Tarain, Aibak was appointed the Subedar of the Indian territories
 vah dilli, lahore tathaa kuch anya kshetron kaa uttaradaayi bana
 He took part in military operations in many areas as an assistant to Ghori and played a major role in these campaigns
 isise khush hokar gori use in kshetron kaa soobedaar niyukt kar gaya tha
 After the conquest of Mahmud Ghori, power was handed over to the Rajput princes in Rajputana but the Rajputs wanted to destroy the influence of the Turks
 sarvapratham, 1192 main usne ajmer tathaa meerut main vidrohon kaa daman kiya tathaa dilli kii satta par arudh hua
 He adopted the policy of conquest of India by making Indraprastha his center near Delhi
 bharat par isse pehle kisi bhi muslim shaasha kaa prabhutv tathaa shashan itane samay tak nahin tikaa tha
 The Jat chieftains surrounded the fort of Hansi and created a crisis for the Ottoman fortress Malik Nasiruddin, but Aibak defeated the Jats and regained the fort of Hansi
 san 1194 main ajmer ke usne duusare vidroh ko dabaaya or kannauj ke shaasha jayachand ke saatthakandawar ke yuddh main apane swami kaa saath diya
 In 1195 AD he conquered Koil
 san 1196 main ajmer ke medon ne tritiy vidroh kaa aayojan kiya jisamen gujarat ke shaasha bhimdev kaa haath tha
 The Medes put Qutbuddin's life in peril, but at the same time the arrival of Mahmud Gauri informed the Medes and Aibak survived
 iske baad 1197 main usne bhimdev kii rajdhani anhilwara ko lutaa or akut dhan lekar waapas lautaa
 Between 1197-98 he captured Kannauj, Chandwar and Badaun
 iske baad usne sirohi tathaa malwa ke kuch bhaagon par adhikaar kar liya
 But this victory could not last forever
 isi saal usne banaras par akraman kar diya
 In 1202-03, he defeated Chandel king Paramardi Dev and strengthened his position by dominating Kalinjar, Mahoba and Khajuraho
 isi samay gori ke sahaayak senapati bakhyiaar khilji ne bengal or bihar par adhikaar kar liya
 Before his death, Mahmud Ghori did not announce anything about his heir
 use shahi khandaan kii bajaay turk daason par adhik vishwaas tha
 Among the slaves of Ghori were Gaiasuddin Mahmud, Yaldauz, Kubacha and Alimardan, besides Aibak
 ye sabhi anbhavi or yogya the or apane aap ko uttaradhikari banane kii yojana bana rahe the
 Ghori had given Aibak the title of Malik but had not decided to make him head of all the chieftains
 aibak kaa gaddi par daawa kamjor tha par usne visham paristhitiyon main kushalta purvak kaam kiya or antat dilli kii satta kaa swami bana
 After the death of Ghori, Qutbuddin reigned on 24 June 1206 but did not hold the title of Sultan
 iskaa kaaran tha ki anya gulam sardaar yalduj or kubacha usase irshyaa rakhte the
 He made Masood in his favor, creating an odd situation for Aibak
 hanlanki turkon ne bengal tak ke kshetra ko rond daalaa tha phir bhi unki sarvocchata sandigdh thi
 The Rajputs also kept revolting, but despite this Aibak faced them all
 bakhtiyaar khilji kii mrityu ke baad alimrdaan ne swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kar di thi tathaa aibak ke swaamitv ko maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 For these reasons, Qutbuddin's reign was spent only in wars
 sainikon athwa anyaanya vyaktiyon ke pratikul yaa lagbhag usee tarah ke kaam, jinke liye pakade jane par shatruon ke dwaara ve dandit kiye ja sakate hai, yuddh aparaadh kahe jate hai
 Acts against international law, which are contrary to the law of the accused's own country, are inherent in war crimes; Such as robbery or murder for the purpose of personal gain, crimes committed on behalf of or on behalf of the enemy nation
 aparaadhon ke prakaar main bhinnata ke kaaran yuddh aparaadh chaar shrenee main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai: Violation of valid rules of war, by members of the armed forces; aise vyaktiyon dwaara, jo shatru kii sena ke sadsy nahin hon, sashastr vidroh; Espionage and war betrayal; lutpaat ke kaam Use of weapons and gas used for toxic or other reasons
 rog athwa aghat se peedit sainikon kinwa nihathe sharnaarthiyon kii hatya yaa unhen ghayal karnaa
 To defraud or to employ fraud
 vishwasghaat kii bhaavana se sharan dene ke liye nivedan yaa usee niyat se rogi kinwa ghayal hone kaa bahaanaa karnaa
 Misdemeanors with murderers, injured or patients and kidnapping of their personal wealth
 shatru paksh ke nirdosh asainik vyaktiyon ko maarna tathaa ghayal karnaa evam unki nijee sapattish kaa apharan athwa vinaash karnaa
 Compel the people of the conquered countries to give talks about the status of the army or their defense

 Destroy or assimilate property of museums, hospitals, churches, schools, etc

 Invading or capturing hospital ships
 yutra ke dauraan main shatrupaksh kii vardi kaa vyavhaar karnaa
 Invading the flag-bearers of the ceasefire
 sandhi kii sharto kaa ulanghan
 Such a defense is not valid if someone has committed an offense under the orders of the warring government or one of its commanders
 kabhi aisi dwia utpann hoti he ki ek ore jahaan sainik apane commander kii ajna paalan karne ko baadhya he, duusari ore us ajna kaa paalan yuddh ke niyam ke pratikul hone ke kaaran aparaadh he
 It may also be possible that during the war, he does not understand the invalidation of the said command from the spiritual point of view and obey the command of his commander
 yuddh ke niyam bahudhaa vivaadaaspad hote hai
 It is also possible that an order may be validated as retaliation even if it is otherwise invalid
 aisi sthiti main aise kaam ko yuddh-aparaadh main praaia: nahin liya jaataa
 However, the main principle is that the soldier is bound to obey the legal orders of his commander
 at: yadi yuddh ke maanya niyamon ke pratikul vah apane ucchadhikari kii ajna kaa paalan karata he to uske daayitv se vah mukt nahin ho saktaa
 Restricting the said responsibility to the commander who ordered it would in fact be the head of state to think about that obligation
 par antarrashtriya evam deshaj, kanoon kii drushti se aisa karnaa vivaadaaspad he
 The International Military Court in its charter did not fully accept the order of the High Officer
 8 wein anuchhed main isane kaha he- 'abhiyukt ne apni sarkaar athwa apane ucchadhikari kii ajna se koi kaam kiya, yah bachaav use us daayitv se mukt nahin kar saktaa
 But in the view of the court, if there is such a demand for justice, then the said defense can be considered in reducing the harshness of the punishment
 ' nuremberg ke nyaayalay ne natsi adhikariyon dwaara prastut kiye gaye bachaav- 'ucchadhikari ke aadesh kaa paalan'- ko asweekaar karte hue kaha ki jaan boojhkar kiye gaye ammanushik aparaadh, yatha gascember main band kar yahudiyon kaa nirmulan, asainik nirmam hatya, aadi ke liye ukt bachaav par dand kii kathorta kam karne ke nimit bhi vichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In December 1946, the United Nations recognized this principle by one vote
 vijit desh ke nivaasiyon athwa yudhbandiyon ke prati yadi sainik yaa nimnakoti ke sainik adhikari atyaachaar karen to aadesh se aisa kaam ho yaa ise rokane dabaane ke liye asane cheshtaa nahin kii to uske viruddh ek dabi prakalpana uthegi ki usne ukt utyachaar kii sweekruti di yaa use protsaahit kiya
 Therefore, he will be liable for the illegal work of his subordinate salis
 isi siddhant par san 1946 i0 amareeki military kamishan ne dwitiya mahayuddh ke dauraan main philippin main japani sainikon dwaara kii gai jyaadati ke liye japani commander yamasti ko prandand diya, yadhyapi usne apane bachaav main kaha ki yatayaat vicchhinn hone ke kaaran vah apane sainikon par niyantran nahin rakh sakaa
 If the residents of the conquered country take on the winners, then their status will not be considered like that of a soldier

 is shrunkhlaa kii prishthbhumi sudur bhavishya main he, jisamen manushya kshirmarg main fail gaye hai or unki jansankhya ek lakh kharab tak pahunch chuki he
 There is a celestial kingdom spread throughout the Kshiramarga
 is daur main harry salden naamak ek vaigyanik or ganitijna ek nae vigyaan kaa avishkaar karata he, jiskaa naam manovaigyanik-itihaas he
 According to him, when the number of human beings becomes so much, then through mathematics it can be predicted that what will happen in the coming history
 vah yah bhavishyavaanee karata he ki akashgangeey samrajya kaa ant nishchit he or uske baad tees hazaar saal kaa ek andhkaarmay yug chalegaa jisamen maanvon kii bahut durdasha hogi
 But he also predicts that this dark period can be limited to only a thousand years if a few steps are taken, after which another kingdom will arise and bring order
 iske liye vah akashganga ke "do chhoron" par do alag sansathane banataa he
 The work of the first institution is to help in bringing the second empire into existence by facing various problems and difficulties
 lekin is kaary main itihaas ke agle pannon main kya hona he, yah us se chupa rakhaa jayega
 In 1966 it won the Hugo Award for "best Science Fiction Series"
 yah upanyaas "pralude tu foundation" ke naam se chapa tha
 Its story begins on the capital planet named Trantor of the Empire, on which buildings are built to such an extent that not even a single piece of land is visible
 harry salden ek aadhyatmik bhaashan detaa he jis se yah zaahir ho jaataa he ki ganit ke prayog se bhavishya bataaya ja saktaa he
 The emperor's spies and goondes immediately follow Saldon, who has to hide him and his female partner named Doors Vanbilli
 salden kaa ek sahaayak, chatter hammin, unhen trenter par jagah-jagah le jaakar chhupaata he
 Solden himself is not very confident of his new mathematics, but Chatter Hamin insists on developing it
 salden isi grah par sthit bhinn-bhinn samskritiyon se parichay paakar faisalaa karata he ki unheen ko aadhaar-saamagree banaakar manovigyaan-itihaas ko viksit karegaa
 This novel was printed under the name "forward the Foundation"
 isamen assi saal guzar chuke hai or harry salden ne apane nae manovigyaan-itihaas ko kaafii viksit kar liya he
 His fame rises greatly and he is given the rank of emperor's minister
 is kitaab main salden apane sabhi kareebi saathiyon ko kho detaa he, jisamen uski patni dorce vanbili bhi he
 His health also deteriorates with age
 vah apni pautri wanda ko duusari sanstha shuru karne kii hidaayat detaa he
 In the novel "foundation", Harry Soldan is being tried for treason against the Empire
 vah kahata he ki uskaa vigyaan batala rahaa he ki samrajya giregaa or phir yaa to tees hazaar varshon ke liye manushyon ko andhkaar kaal main rahanaa hoga yaa phir, agar saare maanav-gyaan ko ek "akashgangeey gyaanakosh" main surakshit kiya jaae, to andhkaar-kaal keval ek hazaar saal tak simit rakhaa ja saktaa he
 He is given permission to form an institution to build his knowledge base on a far-flung planet called Terminus to redeem the body from Harry Saldon
 harry salden apane gyaanakosh-kaaryakartaaon ko lekar vahaan chalaa jaataa he
 At the same time, he quietly starts another institution at the "other end" of the galaxy
 terminus grah pahunchakar gyaanakosh-kaaryakarta asamanjas main pad jate hai
 There are four powerful planets around them that threaten and intimidate them
 gyanakoshiyon ke paas apni akl ko chhodkar koi bhi saadhan nahin he
 The mayor of the capital of Terminus, named Salvador Hardin, strives to maintain the independence of the terminus by conflating these planets and succeeding
 samrajya dhire-dhire thakne lagata he or usamen vaigyanik pragati band hone lagati he, jabaki terminus par pragati jari rahati he
 The devices built in the terminus are smaller but more powerful than the devices built in the empire, whether it be weapons or everyday things
 terminus apane aasapaas ke grahon se vyapaar sambandh badhaata he or akhirakar apane shreshth vigyaan ke boote par unpar niyantran paa letaa he
 It is the merchants of the terminus who work to spread his power
 ek aisa hobar melo naamak vyapaaree itnaa shaktishaalee ho jaataa he ki vah terminus kaa mahayor ban baithta he or foundation kii shakti ko or bhi grahon par failaa detaa he
 In the novel called "foundation and Empire", the Emperor finds the Foundation as a threat
 vah apni sena ko usapar akraman karne kaa hukum detaa he
 The Emperor's army is powerful, but now the science of the foundation has grown so much that despite his army being small, he defeats the empire
 isi dauraan ek "khachchar" naam kaa aadmi ubharta he jisaki kalpana harry salden ne bhi kabhi nahin kari thi
 It has a wonderful power to change the feelings of the people and by its use it starts occupying the outer planets of the foundation
 jab kisi grah ko vijay karnaa ho to pehle vah apni sena ke saath vahaan jaakar uske nagarikon main bhay failaata he or phir apane liye vafadaari kii bhaavana jaagruk karata he
 Four ordinary people - Torren Darrell, his wife Son Darrell, Abling Miss and a street clown named Magnifico - start searching for another institution
 unki ummid he ke duusari sanstha kii madad se khachchar ko haraaya ja saktaa he kyonki kaha jaataa he ki duusari sanstha kaa jor maansik shaktiyon ko ujagar karne par tha
 These four people somehow go to the main library of the capital of the empire, Trantor, and start investigating the address of another institution
 sabase pehle publing miss samaj jaataa he ki yah kaha he lekin jaise hi yah baaqi teenon ko bataane lagata he kii vah kahan sthit he, betaa usapar banduq chalaakar use maar detii he
 She then declares that she regrets killing Abling Miss, but realizes that Magnifico is the man who is searching for another institution
 agar publing miss uskaa pataa bataa detaa to khachchar bhi jaan jaataa or usapar dhaava bol detaa
 Magnifico accepts that he is the mule
 toran dairal or betaa dairal kii jane bakshakar vah chalaa jaataa he or duusari sanstha ko khud hi dhundne kii koshish karata rahata he
 In the novel named "second Institution", the mule has come close to finding another institution
 us se nibatane ke liye duusari sanstha ke log baahar aate hai or yah gyaat hota he kii vah puri akashganga ke sab se budhimaan manushya hai
 Here the first institution emphasizes on the things of worldliness, there the second institution emphasizes on the development of intelligence
 apane sabase teevrbuddhi vyaktiyon kii sahaayta se duusari sanstha khachchar par kaabo paa leti he
 His aggressive mindset is changed to a peace loving mindset
 duusari sanstha ko haraane ke vichaaron ko chhodkar vah apane grahon par shaanti se shashan karne ke liye laut jaataa he
 Seeing the powers of the second institution, the first institution is very jealous
 vah use nasht karne kii thaan leti he
 He tries hard to find them because it is hard to pinpoint exactly what Harry Solden's statement is "at the other end of the galaxy"
 phir unhen yah thanakta he ki akashganga gol he isliye terminus se chalakar doosraa chor terminus par hi hoga
 He manufactures a machine, which causes severe pain to other institutions
 uske istemaal se unhen 50 teevrbuddhiyon kaa ek gut miltaa he jinhen maar diya jaataa he
 The people of the first institution are happy that they have finished the second institution
 vastav main duusari sanstha ne apane bachaav ke liye apane 50 logon kii shahadat di hoti he or vah barqaraar rahati he
 In the novel titled "the Edge of the Foundation", the Foundation's mayor Harla Branno begins to suspect that the second institution was not actually finished
 vah golan trevies naamak ek faujee afasar ko yanov palorat naam ke vidwaan or anya saathiyon ke saath duusari sanstha kii khoj par ravaanaa karti he
 After interacting with the palate, Treviz begins to think that another entity is on a planet called Earth
 kitaab main bataaya jaataa he ki prithvi ko log lagbhag bhula chuke hai or bahut se log samajhate hai ki aisa koi grah he hi nahin
 Earth is not included in any encyclopedia and it is mentioned only in mythology
 trevies ko lagata he ki prithvi ko jaanboojh kar chupaaya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, on the planet of another institution, the principal urban named Store Gandible finds an ordinary person, who has some signs of making some changes in his intellect
 yah badlaav itani safaai se kiya gaya he ki duusari sanstha kii kshamta ke baahar he
 Gendible realizes that there is a person or force in the galaxy that may be overshadowed by another entity
 vah pehle hi trevies par nazre gadaaye hue tha kyonki trevies aksar duusari sanstha ke kilaaf bolaa karata tha
 Now he decides to chase Trevize because he believes that Treviz, while searching for another organization, will surely find this new hidden power
 apni khoj main trevies or palorat ek gaaya naam ke grah dhund lete hai jisapar teevrbuddhi log basate hai
 Here all beings and things are connected with each other with consciousness and intelligence
 unka peechha karte hue brano or gandibal bhi alag-alag vahaan pahunch jate hai
 On Gaia, Trevi's is forced to choose one of three paths for the future of man: the victory of the first institution and the empire based on its system, the victory of the second institution and the empire governed by its control, Or the birth of a vast celestial consciousness connecting Gaia to the intelligentsia of the entire galaxy
 trevies teesraa rastaa chunata he
 After her election, Gaia's vast consciousness changes Brano's intelligence, allowing Brano to understand that the first institution is victorious
 gandibal main bhi parivartan kiya jaataa he ki duusari sanstha vijayi he or vah apane grah laut jaataa he
 Treviz himself does not know exactly why he chose Gaia
 "foundation or prithvi" naam ke upanyaas ke armbh main dikhaaya jaataa he ki trevies prithvi kii khoj par laga hua he
 She is accompanied by a Palorat and also a Gaia Ki resident Blissanobiarella
 trevies ko akashganga main teen sthanon ke pate milte hai lekin uske yaan kaa computer vahaan sthit kisi grah ke bare main nahin jaanata
 In the first place he finds a planet named Aurora where there are ruins but no humans
 dusre sthaan par malpomania naamak grah miltaa he
 There is no human here and its weather has deteriorated
 yahan keval carbon dioxide se jeene vaali ek kaai he jo foran unke yaan par fail jaati he
 Somehow after finishing that moss, he goes to the third place where his planet named Solaria is found
 yahan teevrbuddhiyon kaa ek chota samudaay rahata he
 When one of these poses a threat to Trevise and his companions, Bliss kills him using Gaia's powers

 Treviz and his companions escape to Solaria with the child
 akhirakar ve prithvi dhund lete hai lekin vahaan bhi unhen koi suraag nahin miltaa
 Treviz then thinks of looking at the moon of the earth
 jab unka yaan chaand ke paas pahunchataa he jo apane aap hi use koi shakti khinchne lagati he or chaand ke centre main le jaati he
 There they find a robot named r नी Danielle Olivo
 olivo unhen samajhaata he ki vah nasht hone ke sameep he or usko thik karne liye purze bananaa asambhav he
 He says that it is important to keep his memories and consciousness alive for human welfare because it is possible that some creature from outside the galaxy may attack humans
 jivit rahane ke liye uski chetana kaa kisi manushya ke saath leen ho janaa aavashyak he
 Treviz then has to decide whether or not to allow Olivo's consciousness to meet with the child's great intelligence
 isamen maanavjaati kaa faaydaa bhi he lekin bachche ke iraadon main kuch gadabad bhi lag rahi thi
 At the end of the book it is not clear whether Trevi's answer was 'yes' or 'no', although it is indicated that it was probably 'yes'

 Its author is Badarayan

 Many commentaries have also been written on this
 veydant ke teen mukhya stambh maane jate hai - upanishad, bhagavadagita evam brahmasutra
 All three are called the Departure Trilogy
 isamen upanishdon ko shruti prasthaan, gita ko smriti prasthaan or brahmasutron ko nyaay prasthaan kehete hai
 Calling the Brahman Sutras a justice departure means that it presents Vedanta in a completely logical manner
 pracheen parampara ke anusaar vedantasutra ke lekhak baadaraayan maane jate hai
 But in these formulas, the name of Badarayana has been quoted and his opinion is cited, so some people do not consider it as a work of Badrayana and it is called the work of a later collector
 baadaraayan or vyas kii kabhi-kabhi ek mana jaataa he
 Jaimini mentions Badarayana in his predecessor book and Badrayana mentions Jaimini in Vedantasutras
 yadi baadaraayan or vyas ek hi hai to mahabharat kii parampara ke anusaar jaimini vyas ke shishy the
 And the Guru mentions the disciple's opinion in his work, it seems strange

 The Gita is also pointed out

 Garuda Purana, Padmapurana and Manusmriti discuss the Vedanta Sutras

 According to Keith, this composition would not be later than 200 AD
 jakobi ise 200 se 450 i

 Max Müller considers it to be the earlier work of the Bhagavad Gita because it contains the word Brahmasutra which is synonymous with Vedantasutra

pus
 500 se 200 ke bich maanate hai
 Just as the interpretation of the ritualistic part of the Veda is presented in the Mimamsasutra, in the same way, the interpretation of the Upanishads, the last part of the Vedic hymns, is given in about 500 Vedantasutras divided into four chapters
 upanishdon main pratipaadit siddhant itane paraspar virdohi tathaa bikhare hue he ki unase ek paprakaar kaa darshanik mat nikaalnaa kathin he
 The Vedānta Sutra formulates a philosophical vision in the Upanishads by resorting to the principle of ‘coordination’
 par ye sutara swayan itane sankshipt he ki bina vyakhya ke sahare unase arth nikaalnaa kathin he
 Due to their brevity, many interpretations were written on them which renders Vedanta in conflicting terms
 vedant ke sabhi prasthaan in sutron ko apana pramaan maanate hai
 These formulas are also called Brahmasutras due to the rendering of Brahma
 brahmasutra main chaar adhyay hai jinke naam hai - samanvay, avirodh, saadhan evam fal
 Each chapter has four legs

 Apart from this, Madhavacharya, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Bhaskar, Nimbark etc

 According to research published in the respected journal Nature, this civilization is at least 8000 years old
 yah hadappa sabhyataa or 'sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa' ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he
 It developed along the banks of the Indus and Ghaghghar / Hakra

 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government
 isi kram main 1861 main elexander kaningham ke nirdesan main bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 In 1904, John Marshall was made director general of the Indian Archaeological Department by Lord Curzon
 flit ne is puraani sabhyataa ke bare main ek lekh likhaa
 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization
 pratham baar nagaron ke udai ke kaaran ise pratham nagarikaran bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization

 80 percent of the site is in the vicinity of the Saraswati River and its tributaries

 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state
 inamen se aadhe darjanon ko hi nagar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh
 dono hi sthal vartmaan pakistan main hai
 Both were 483 km away from each other and were connected by the Indus River
 teesraa nagar mohen jo dado se 130 kimi dakshin main chanhudado sthal par tha to chauthaa nagar gujarat ke khambhaat kii khadi ke upar lothal naamak sthal par
 Apart from this, Kalibanga in the northern part of Rajasthan and Banavali in Hisar district of Haryana
 in sabhi sthalon par paripakv tathaa unnat hadappa samskruti ke darshan hote hai
 The mature state of this culture is also seen in the coastal towns of Sutkagandor and Surkotada
 in donon kii visheshta he ek ek nagar durg kaa hona
 The North Harappan stage has also been found at Rangpur and Rosadi sites in the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat
 is sabhyataa kii jaankaree sabase pehle 1826 main charles main ko praapt hui
 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai
 15
23 m each Long and 6
09 m
 Is wide and some one meter from the river bank
 in baarah ikaiyon kaa talakshetra lagbhag 838
125 varg me
 he jo lagbhag utana hi hota he jitna mohan jodado ke kothaar kaa
 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area
 ve chakke se parichit the or sambhawatah aajkal ke ikke jaisaa koi vaahan prayog karte the
 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier
 vyapaar ke liye unhen maap taul kii aavashyaktaa hui or unhonen iskaa prayog bhi kiya
 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together
 mohenjo daro main nagar or jal nikaas ki vyavastha se mahamari ki sambhaavna kam lagati he
 Evidence of severe firefighting has also been obtained
 mohenzodaro ke ek kamare se 14 nar kankal mili he jo akraman, aagjanee, mahamari ke sanket he
 a well and bath house located in the city of Indus Valley Civilization ek bail ke murti a drain located in the ancient city of Lothal laal mitti se bane ek paatr ke avshesh Ritual character aabaaji tubaaji saanap jo 'bhagawanbaba' ke naam se prasiddh the, unka janamah bid jilhe main huwa tha
 
 maharashtra ke warkari sampradaay ke prasiddh sant the
 Bhagwan Baba is the pride of Hindus

 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 1895 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 1895 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 Value-added tax, or goods and services tax, is a consumption tax, at any value that is added to a product

 VAT is an indirect tax, in the form that the tax is collected from someone who does not bear the full cost of the tax

 Private end consumers of products and services cannot charge VAT on purchases, but the industry purchases goods and services that they purchase to provide further supply or service, which will be sold directly or indirectly to the end user, VAT Can be charged is tarah, aapurti kii aarthik shrinkhalaa main prayek str par lagaaya gaya kul kar, mulya kaa ek nirantar ansh he jo ek vyavsaay dwaara apane utpaadon main joda jaataa he or kar sangrah kii laagat kaa adhikansh, rajya ke bajaay kaarobaar dwaara vahan kiya jaataa he

 Value added tax avoids the stale effect of sales tax by taxing the value added at every stage of production
 paaramparik bikri kar kii bajaay mulya yojit karadhaan ko duniya bhar main pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 In principle, value-added taxes apply to all commercial activities that involve the production and distribution of goods and the provision of services
 ek vyavsaay ke prayek lenden main maal main jude mulya par waite kaa moolyankan or ekathran kiya jaataa he
 Under this concept, the government is taxed on the gross margin of each transaction
 bharat jaise kai vikasshil deshon main, bikri kar / waite ek mahatvapurn rajasav strot hai chunki ucch berojgaare or nune prati vyakti aay, anya aay sroton ko aparyaapt bana detii he
 However, this is opposed by many sub-national governments as it reduces the total revenue collection they collect as well as some loss of autonomy
 bikri kar aamtaur par upabhoktaaon ko keval antim bikri par lagaae jate hai: pratipurti kii vajah se, waite kaa antim keemton par vaisaa hi samgr aarthik prabhaav padataa he
 The main difference is just the additional accounting that needs to be done by those who fall in the middle of the supply chain, not taking into account this lack of VAT, on each member of the production chain, their position in this chain of customers and customers
 Giving and eliminating attempts to check and certify their status is balanced by the use of the same tax
 jab waite pranali main kuch chhot ho to, yadi koi ho, jaisaa kii newjiland main GST ke saath, waite kaa bhugtan karnaa or bhi aasaan ho jaataa he
 a common economic consideration is that if sales tax exceeds 10%, then people become largely involved in tax evasion activities
 duusari ore, kul waite dar, abhinav sangrah pranali ke kaaran vyapak chori ke bina 10% se adhik ho sakati he
 However, because of the special arrangement of its collections, VAT quite easily becomes the target of specific frauds such as carousel fraud which can be very costly for states in terms of tax revenue reduction
 waite lagu karne ke liye maanak tarika yah siddhant he ki ek vyapaar utpaada kii keemat se purv main chukaaye gaye sabhi kar ko ghataate hue kuch pratishat kaa adhikaar rakhata he

 Each business has a strong incentive for suppliers to pay their taxes, leading to a higher VAT rate than a retail sales tax, with less tax evasion

 In the account-based method, no such special invoice is used

 The invoice method is used in most countries today, the only exception being Japan where accounting is used
 sangrah ke samay dwaara, waite yaa to prodbhavan yaa nakad aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Cash based accounting is a very simple form of accounting

 Checks are written when money is available to bill and the expense is recorded on the date of the check - regardless of when the expense was incurred
 praathmik dhyaan, bank main nakadi kii raashi par kendrit hota he or madhyamik dhyaan yah sunishchit karne main ki sabhi bilon kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya he
 There is not much effort in comparing revenue with the time period when they were earned, or in matching the expenses to the period when they were incurred
 prodbhavan aadhaarit lekhankan, rajasav kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya or kharchon kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Although it is more complex than cash-based accounting, it provides more information about your business
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako, praptiyon ko trek karne main sakasham karata he or dey 
 The accrual basis helps you match revenue to the expenditure incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports

 With a 10% sales tax: atah upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne is raashi ko ekatra kar liya
 The retailer has not lost anything directly to the tax and the retailers have to do additional paperwork so that the sales tax collected by them is properly passed on to the government
 aapurtikarta or nirmaataaon par sahi praaanpatr kii aapurti karne kaa prashasnic boj rahata he or yah jaanch karnaa ki unke graahak upabhokta nahin hai
 With 10% VAT: yani upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne yah rakam karadhaan main ekatra kii
 The business lost nothing directly to the tax

 Note that in each case the VAT paid is equal to 10% of the profit or value added
 bikri kar vyavastha kii tulana main waite pranali kaa laabh yah he ki udyog, khapat ko, yah pramanit karte hue ki yah ek upabhokta nahin he, chipa nahin sakate 
 In the above example, we assumed that the same number of widgets were manufactured and sold before and after the introduction of the tax
 yah vaastavik jivan main sach nahin he
 The fundamentals of supply and demand suggest that any tax increases the transaction price for anyone, whether a buyer or seller
 An increase in price either shifts the demand curve left, or the supply curve shifts upward
 Both are functionally equal
 natijatan, kharide gaye saamaan kii maatra ghat jaati he or / yaa jis keemat ise bechaa jaataa he vah bad jaati he
 The above example does not include this variation of supply and demand, for simplicity and because these effects are different for each type of commodity
 uparokt udhaaharan maanata he ki kar gaiyr virupanyogy he
 Like all other taxes, a VAT, without it, deflects it
 kyonki kisi ke liye keemat bad jaati he, maal kii maatra ghat jaati he
 Accordingly, some people are made worse by more where the government gets better than tax income
 yani, aapurti or maang parivartan ke kaaran tex main hone vaale phaayde kii tulana main kahin zyada haani hoti he
 This is known as deadweight loss
 arthvyavastha dwaara kho di gai aay, sarkaar kii aay se adhik hoti he; kar aksham he
 The entire amount of government income may not be a deadweight drag, if tax revenues are used for profitable spending or have positive externality - in other words, governments can do much more than simply consume tax income
 
 jabaki virupan hote hai, waite jaise upbhog kar, aksar behatar maane jate hai kyonki ve protsaahan ko nivesh ke liye viroopit karte hai, anya prakaar ke adhikansh karadhaan kii tulana main bachat or kaary kam hota he - duusare shabdon main, ek waite utpaadan ke bajaay khapat ko hatotsahit karata he

 Defendants claim that the removal of taxation through income is an arbitrary standard and that value-added tax is actually a proportional tax and that high-income people pay more at the same rate at which they consume more
 donon hi maapan, waite ko ek pragatisheel iskar banane ke bajaay adhik pratigaami banaate hai
 The effective regressive quality of a VAT system can also increase because different classes of goods are taxed at different rates
 isliye waite adhikansh rup se ek flats kar he or vyavhaar main pratigaami ho saktaa he
 Revenue from a value-added tax is often lower than expected because they are difficult and expensive to manage and collect
 kai deshon main, jahaan vyaktigat aay kar or companiyon ke laabh kar kaa sangrah aitihaasik rup se kamjor rahaa he, vahaan waite sangrah anya karon ke mukaable adhik safal rahaa he
 VAT has become more important in many jurisdictions as tariff levels have fallen worldwide due to trade liberalization and essentially VAT has replaced lost tariff revenue

 VAT is more avoidable in some industries, particularly where cash transactions prevail and VAT may be criticized for promoting it
 sarkaar ke drushtikon se, tathaapi, waite, behatar ho saktaa he kyonki yah kam se kam kuch mulya yojan ko pakad saktaa he
 For example, a carpenter may provide services for cash to a homeowner who usually cannot claim an input VAT back
 isliye grihaswami ko kam laagat lagegi or badhai anya karon se batch saktaa he 
 The government will, however, still receive VAT for many other inputs that have been sold to the carpenter and the carpenter will be unable to reclaim VAT on these inputs

 Because exports are generally zero-rated, this is often where VAT fraud occurs

 a large quantity of valuable goods is transported from one member state to another

 The first companies, called 'missing traders' go bankrupt without paying

 This type of fraud originated in Benelux countries in the 1970s

 There are other possibilities of similar fraud within a country

 XX Member countries of the European Union are required to join
 ek upbhog kar ke rup main, EU waite, EU waite kshetra main maal or sevaaon kii khapat par kar lagaataa he
 The key issue of EU VAT asks where supply and consumption take place, thus determining which member countries will collect VAT and how much the VAT rate will be levied
 prayek sadsy desh ke rashtriya waite kanoon ko, EU waite kanoon ke praavdhaanon kaa paalan karnaa chahie jo directive 2006 / 112 / EC main varnit hai
 It explains the basic framework of a Directive EU VAT, but allows Member States little flexibility in the implementation of VAT legislation
 udhaaharan ke liye, europea sangh ke bhinn sadsy deshon main, waite kii bhinn daron kii anumati di gai he
 But according to Directive 2006 / 112 the standard rate of VAT in member countries should be at least 15% and one or two reduced rates should not be less than 5%
 kuch sadsy deshon main, kuch nishchit aapurtiyon par 0% waite dar he - in sadsy deshon ne ise, EU acesan treety ke ke hisse ke rup main sweekaar kiya hoga 
 The current maximum rate in practice in the European Union is 25%, although member countries are free to set higher interest rates
 waite jise ek vyavsaay dwaara lagaaya jaataa he or iske graahakon dwaara diya jaataa he, use "output waite" kehete hai 
 The VAT paid by one business to other businesses on the supplies received is called "input VAT"
 aam taur par ek udyog us seemaa tak input waite ko waapas vasuul saktaa he jitna iske kar yogya output par input waite manaa ja saktaa he 
 Input VAT is charged by setting it opposite to the output VAT which requires the business to be in the Government account, or, if there is an excess, claiming a repayment from the Government
 waite directive ke anusaar kuch vastuon or sevaaon ko waite se mukt hona chahie or kuch anya vastuon or sevaaon ko waite se mukt hona chahie lekin un aapurtiyon par waite kaa vikalp ek europea sangh ke sadsy desh ke adheen ho 
 The input VAT that is chargeable to free supply is not receivable, although a business can increase its prices so that the customer can effectively bear the cost of 'sticking' VAT

 The seller of these tax-exempt services or goods is not subject to VAT and does not pay tax on sales

 The OECD responds by citing Chanchal Kumar Sharma as approving why implementing a federal VAT in India has proved difficult
 kitaab main likhaa he: "although the implementation of a broad-based federal VAT system has been regarded as the most desirable consumption tax for India since the early 1990s, such reforms will involve serious problems for the finances of regional governments
 In addition, the introduction of VAT in India in the context of the current economic reforms will prove to be the inverse dimension for India's federal system
 Has paved the way for decentralization of responsibilities, which in turn call for greater decentralization of revenue-raising power, to maintain financial accountability
 duusari ore, waite lagu karne se rajyon ko rajasav ghaataa hoga or adhik kendrikaran ke saath unki swaittata main kami hogi" Chanchal Kumar Sharma insists: "political compulsions prompted the government to present an inconsistent model of VAT" 'the Indian VAT system is incomplete' to the extent that it 'goes against the core principles of VAT'
 India seems to have a 'worthless VAT', because the reasons for which VAT receives educational support have been disregarded in the Indian style of VAT, namely: removing distortion in the movement of goods in the States; Uniformity in tax structure
 Chanchal Kumar Sharma categorically states, "local or state level taxes, such as octroi, entry tax, lease tax, labor contract tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax have not been integrated into the new governance regime which provides the basic elements of VAT Goes against that according to which there should be uniformity in the tax structure

 Schedule II deals with zero rated transactions like exports and Schedule III deals with taxable goods at the rate of 1%, ie, jewelry made of bullion and precious stones

 In various literary works, eight other books authored by you are adorned by Sanskrit Vadmaya
 inhone rugveda kii anek kavitaaon kaa saras hindi kavyanuwaad bhi kiya tha
 Kalanath Shastri has written on his work- {citation} - "in March 2003, the Indian Council of Philosophical Research in Delhi held a huge scholarly seminar to congratulate him on completing 80 years, in which philosophers, historians, Sanskrit-mystics around the world , Writer, poet etc
 were present
 unke sarjanaatmak or vimarshatmak vaidushya ke ayaamon par teen din tak charchaa hui thi
 The research articles read in that seminar also appeared in the booklet
 hindi main bhi ek granth us sangoshtee ke nishkarshon ko shaamil kar nikaala gaya, jiskaa sheershak tha ‘avyay : acharya govind chandra pande kaa sarjanaatmak avdaan’ 2005:, kintu usamen bhi un ke krititv kaa puraa chitra nahin tha, kyonki uskaa falak bahut vyapak he
 He wrote more than fifty books on ten fifteen subjects in ancient history, Buddhist culture, Vedic poetry, value epics, history philosophy, Indian philosophy, Shankaracharya, comparative religion, comparative aesthetics etc
, were in English, Hindi and Sanskrit trio
 anuwaad alag the
 " "darshan, itihaas or sanskrit ke gahan gyaan ne inase jo granth likhwaaye, unamem gunta, praudhata or sankshep main baat kehane kii pravanta hona swaabhaavik tha
 In his texts printed from the Rajasthan Hindi Granth Academy, 'price Mimamsa' reflects all these characteristics
 " "his treatises on Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist India are considered excellent
 jyotish par bhi unka adhikaar tha
 In later days, his book 'vedic Culture' written to present all-round discourse of Vedic literature is also a peak level text
 yah granth jab likhaa ja rahaa tha, main inke nikat sampark main tha, kyonki inkaa yah shauk suprasiddh tha ki elahabaad main rahete hue apane janmdin par elahabaad museum main desh ke shikharstha manishiyon kii kisi na kisi vishay par ek rashtriya sangoshtee avashya hi yojit hoti thi
 He used to call half-baked people like me
 maine is granth kaa sheershak sujhaayaa tha ‘vaidic vaanmay’, par unhone ‘vaidic samskruti’ naam kyon rakhaa, iskaa auchity unhone yah bataaya ki is main upanishad vaanmay kaa bhi puraa vimarsh he
 This title can only contain both
 inhone vahiin bataaya tha ki netaji subhash chandra bose ke mitra kshetresh babu se ye sanskrit padhe the or unke saamne bhi unki kakshaayen, unke aadesh par ye sanskrit madhyam main hi padhaate the
 From this you can guess to what extent they had authority over Sanskrit
 aaj shaayad desh main chaar-paanch vidvan hi us kad-lathi ke bache hon
 " "prasiddh angreji kaviyon kii kavitaaon kaa sanskrit main anuwaad ‘astachalium’ or praakrit gaatha saptshati kaa hindi ke dohon main anuwaad ‘mahilaayein’ sheershak se unhone nikaala

 In this, the discussion of religion that he has covered, from the concept of religion in the history of human beings, to the interpretation of religions that make religion a sect
 koi sanskrit-pandit bhi aisa granth likh paae, yah kam hi sambhav he
 More wonderful than this is their comparative aesthetics, titled 'aesthetic Dissertation:'
 isamen unani saundaryashastra se lekar bom garton kii german kala paribhaashaon se hote hue sanskrit kavyashastra ko lapet kar francisi kroche or astitvvaad tak ye apane vimarsh ko le aae hai
 It is difficult to write all this in Sanskrit, although Sanskrit is the only language in the world in which words can be formed for concepts around the world
 aise shabd banaate-banaate inhone, germany ke ek saundaryashastri bom garton kaa naam bhi sanskrit main utaar daalaa ‘vrikshodyan’! !!" {uddhran-ant} 1
