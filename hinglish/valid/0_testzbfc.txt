 The final free practice session is followed by a qualifying session
 yah satr res ke armbh kram kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 For most of the history of the game, qualifying sessions were slightly different from practice sessions; Drivers had an entire session in which they had to try to set their fastest time, sometimes within a limited number of tries, each driver's best single lap, fastest to fastest
 They had to do this with the grid order set by
 grid ko sabase tej 26 kaaron ke liye simit kiya jaataa tha or res ko qualifi karne ke liye driveron ko pole sitor ke 107% ke bheetar lap karnaa padataa tha
 Other formats include Friday pre-qualifying and sessions in which each driver was allowed only one qualifying lap and a separate run in a predetermined order
 vartmaan qualifing pranali ko 2006 ke satr ke liye apanaaya gaya tha
 This competition, known as "knock-out" qualifying, is divided into three periods
 prayek avadhi main, agle avadhi se aage nikalne kii koshish main qualifing lap ke liye car chalaate hai, apni icchaanusaar adhik se adhik lap kaa chakkar lagaate hai or saath main avadhi ke ant main sabase dhime driver "nikaal diya" jaataa tha or unke sarvshereshth lap ke chakkaron ke aadhaar par unke grid sthiti ko nirdhaarit kiya jaataa tha
 Cars are removed in a similar manner until only 10 cars are eligible to try to qualify for pole position in the third and final period
 prayek avadhi ke liye sabhi pichley chakkaron ko phir se nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he or us avadhi main ek driver ke keval sabase adhik lap kii hi ginati hoti he
 Under the current rules, any scheduled lap starting before the fall of the colorful flag indicating the end of that period for all periods can be completed and will be counted as the location of that driver and still If they cross the end line after the end of the period
 pehle do avadhi main, car apni icchaanusaar kisi bhi tarah ke tair kaa upyog kar sakate hai or in avadhiyon main nikaale gaye driveron ko res se pehle apni pasand ke anusaar tiron ko badalane kii anumati di jaati he
 However the cars participating in the final period should start the race with the tire of their choice at the end of qualifying
 With no refueling allowed during races since 2010, the final season is conducted with a low-fuel configuration and refueling in cars after qualification is determined
 udhaaharan ke liye, 20 kaaron vaale ek grid ke liye, sabhi 20 kaaron ko pehle avadhi main bhaag lene kii anumati he

 Once all the cars have formed on the grid, a lighting system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at a one-second interval; They then extinguish together after an unspecified time to indicate the start of the race

 The race can be started from behind a safety car if the authorities feel that the start of racing will be too terrible, such as if the track is wet
 There is no formation spur when the race starts from behind the safety tax

 Drivers can quickly overtake each other for position on the route of the race and are 'classified' in the order in which they complete the race
 yadi koi leader sanyog se ek back marker se miltaa he jisane kuch hi chakkar puure kiye ho, to back marker ko nila jhanda dikhaaya jaataa he or use bataaya jaataa he ki vah leader ko apane se aage nikalne kii anumati dene ke liye baadhya he
 The slow car is called 'lapd' and, once the leader completes the race, is classified as completing the 'one lap down' race
 ek driver ke saamne kisi bhi car dwaara uskaa kai baar chakkar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 a driver who fails to complete the race due to mechanical problems, accident, or any other reason is asked to leave the race and is not 'categorized' in the results

 Throughout the race, drivers can take pit stops to replace tires and repair damage
 Different teams and drivers adopt different pit stop strategies with the aim of increasing their own car capacity

 haal ke varshon main, phir se eendhan bharne or tair ko badalane ke niyamon ke parivartan par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Since the 2010 season, refueling — which was reintroduced in 1994 — is not permitted, which is intended to encourage less tactical racing on safety matters
 res ke dauraan istemaal kiye jane vaale tair kii aavashyak donon jodiyon ke niyam ko 2007 main lagu kiya gaya jiskaa uddeshy phir se trek par racing ko protsaahit karnaa tha

 If a team of two completes the race by scoring car points, both of them receive Constructors Championship points, which means that drivers and constructors championships often have different results
 ank praapt karne ke liye, ek driver ko vargeekrut hona padataa he
 To be correctly stated, the driver does not have to complete the race to be classified, but the winning driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance
 isliye, res ke khatm hone se pehle res se baahar nikaale jane par bhi kuch ank praapt kar paanaa ek driver ke liye sambhav he
 In those situations when less than 75% of the races are covered, only half points are awarded to drivers and constructors

 In fact, for much of the first decade of Formula One, competitive cars were so lacking that Formula Two cars were added to fill the grid
 pheraari hi ekmaatr abhi tak kaa sakriy team he jisane 1950 main pratiyogita kii thi
 Initial manufacturer interactions emerged as "factory teams" or "works teams", such as the team of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault
 In fact, after the disappearance by the early 1980s, factory teams began to operate in the 1990s and Returned in the 2000s and formed half of the grid with either Ferrari, Jaguar BMW, Renault, Toyota and Honda either establishing their own teams or purchasing existing teams

 Instead, each tire had four large peripheral grooves on its surface that were designed to limit the speed of turning cars

 Despite this, today's generation cars can reach speeds of up to 350 km / h on some circuits

 Even with limitations on aerodynamics, the aerodynamically driven downforce at 160 km / h is equal to the weight of the car and the repeated claims that Formula One cars produce significantly lower weight when "driving at altitude", while the theory Is possible, has never been put to the test

 The downforce means that cars can achieve a lateral force of magnitude 3
5 times the force of gravity at the time of turning

 Each driver may not use more than one gearbox for four consecutive contests; Each undetermined gearbox change requires the driver to leave five places on the grid until he or she fails to complete the previous race due to reasons beyond the team's control

 Formula One went through a difficult situation in the early 2000s
 The dominance of Michael Schumacher and Scuderia Ferrari led to a decrease in viewership and fans expressed their reluctance
 Since 2005, there are some signs of improvement in the condition of the viewing public due to various seasons

 The service provided viewers with a number of contemporary feeds that were manufactured with the help of cameras, technical equipment, and staff aside from the equipment used for traditional coverage
 ise saal dar saal kai deshon main shuru kiya gaya lekin vittiya kaarnon kii vajah se 2002 ke satr ke baad band kar diya gaya
 TV stations receive what is known as the "world feed", whether it is produced by the FOM or sometimes by the "host broadcaster"
 "premiere" was the only station that really differed from it — a German channel that offered all sessions live and interactive as well as an onboard channel
 yah seva 2002 ke ant tak adhik vyapak rup se europe bhar main uplabdh tha, jab digital sanvadatmak sevaaon ke ek sampoorn alag sambharan kii laagat haalanki bahut adhik thi
 This was in large part due to the failure of the "F1 Digital +" channel launched through Sky Digital in the United Kingdom

 However, at the beginning of its coverage for the 2009 season, the BBC relaunched complementary features such as the "red Button" in-car camera angle, multiple soundtracks, and a rolling highlights package

 Bernie Ecclestone had announced that F1 would adopt the HD format near the end of the 2007 season
 a subsequent announcement made in early 2008 claimed that the BBC would broadcast F1 for five years from 2009, taking over from ITV which had been broadcasting it since 1997

 But both words are not interchangeable
 gaur karen ki: This difference is most relevant when career summaries and "to-date lists" are considered
 udhaaharan ke liye, formula van driveron kii suchi main clement biyondatty ke naam ke aage 1 res dikhaaya gaya he
 Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950, but only one of them was counted for the World Championship

 One example of the most recent "formula One race" was the 2005 United States Grand Prix, among the races that have been denied the status of "world Championship Race"
 20 main se 14 driveron ne apane michelin tiron kii samasya ke kaaran racing nahin kii or is samasya kaa ek upyukt samaadhaan dhund nikaalane main asafal hone kii vajah se ek gaiyr-championships res kii mejabani karne ke samjhaute main 10 main se 9 team shesh rah gaye
 It was only because Ferrari refused to follow through on these plans that this failure resulted, although it was said that Mosley had informed Mr
 Martin, the most senior representative of the FIA in the USA, that If some kind of non-championship race was conducted, or there was some kind of change in the circuit, then all of the US Grand Prix and indeed the FIA regulations in the US Cloud Mnderaange danger on Otrsport
 The same Stodart edition of the competitions was published on the same day, the FIA issued a statement denying that Mosley had allegedly threatened or had any such conversation

 3 june 2011 The Mahar Regiment is an infantry regiment of the Indian Army
 yadhyapi multah ise maharashtra ke mahaar sainikon ko milakar banane kaa vichaar tha, kintu keval yahi bhartiya sena kaa ekmaatr regiment he jise bharat ke sabhi samudaayon or kshetron ke sainikon ko milakar banaaya gaya he
 The Mahar Scouts and their forces were recruited by the Maratha king Shivaji as soldiers in the fort
 unka ek bada hissaa banane company ke bombay sena ke chathe hisse main east india company company dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 The Bombay Army favored the Mahar soldiers for their bravery and loyalty to the flag and also because they could be trusted during the anglo-maratha War
 ve kai safaltaaon hasil kii he, koregaanv kii ladaai, jahaan mahaar bahul company sainikon ko ek bahut bada peshwa bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main parajeet main bhi shaamil he
 The battle was celebrated by an obelisk, the Koregaon Pillar, which went on to raid the summit of the Mahar Regiment until Indian independence
 bombay sena kii mahaar sainikon ne 1857 ke bhartiya vidroh] main karrwai ko dekha, or do regimenton main shaamil ho gaye is regiment ke british yuddh tahat vidroh "bolo hindustan kii jai" he
 After the rebellion the British officers of the Indian Army, especially those who had served in the First and Second Afghan Wars, began to give currency to the martial race doctrine
 yah siddhant tha ki kuch bhartiya jatiyon or samudaayon ke bich swaabhaavik rup se jangi, or adhik dusron kii tulana main yuddh ke liye anukool the
 a major proponent of this doctrine was Lord Roberts, who in November 1885 was the commander-in-chief, gradually "punjabisation" of the Indian Army to the detriment of other communities of the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon ke liye antim jhatka, 1892 main aayaa jab yah "varg regimenton" santhaan ko bhartiya sena main nirnay liya gaya
 The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, along with some other classes, were now enlisted in the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon, jo 104 vysarai kamishan adhikari or gaiyr kamishan adhikariyon or sipaahiyon ke ek mejabaan shaamil demobilized the
 This incident was perceived by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a governmental they had worked for over a hundred years
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilized
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 B
 R
 Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col v
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer noticed in dispatches
 They are also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Center was established at Kamptee
 The following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 His entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret

 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive

 nattejey ke taur par vyay main katautee hoti he or aarthik vruddhi main dhimaapan aata he
 But, in the same process, the foundation of future economic growth is laid and once again there are trends to save for further investment
 wilfredo parato italvi pita kii santan the jinhen italy kii sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa virodh karne ke kaaran paris main nirvasit jivan vyateet karnaa pad rahaa tha
 His middle-class family managed his primary education well and gave him the rites of rigorous study and simple living
 1858 main italy laut kar unhone ejineering kii degree lee
 While working as an engineer, Pareto made several trips to England and Scotland and during this he got an opportunity to observe the British economy
 unhone dekha ki mukt bazaar niti kaa britain ko kitna faaydaa ho rahaa he
 He became an active member of the Adam Smith Society and began writing in support of democracy and free trade
 parato ko raat main neend kam aati thi
 He used this time in the study of political economics and sociology
 ritair hone ke baad unhone apni ejineering training kaa faaydaa uthaa kar aarthik vishleshan ko ganitiya roopon main vyakt karnaa shuru kiya
 Soon his fame grew and he was appointed to replace Leon Walrus at the University of Luzane
 aage chal kar parato ganitiya vidhiyon kii sankeernata se ukta gayi or aitihaasik or saanskrithik sandarbhon ke aaine main aarthik gatividhiyon ko parakhane kaa prayaas karne lage
 With inherited wealth from his uncle, he bought a huge bungalow in which, like a monk, living alone with his domesticated cats, he spent his life looking at the problems of economics
 arthshaastra ko ganitiya aadhaar dene ke alaava parato apane teen anya yogadanon ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 He developed the law of income distribution which is still known by his name
 unhone arthshaastriyon kaa dhyaan cardinal upyogita se hataa kar ordenal upyogita kii taraf dilaayaa
 He also developed an examination method through which it could be ascertained whether the economic results could be improved
 ise parato dwaara pratipaadit anukultam paristhiti ke siddhant ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Pareto studied the inequalities of income in different nations and observed that this income distribution follows a smooth pattern
 unhone pariwaron kaa kram unki aamadani ke hisaab se lagaaya or phir unki aamadani darj karke uskaa vishleshan kiya
 The result was that income was not increasing proportionately or arithmetic
 sabase zyaada garib parivaar se lekar sabase zyaada amir parivaar tak ke kram main aay jyamitiya rup se badhati dikhi
 If the income were to increase in arithmetic order, the family of number thirty would earn twenty percent more than the family of number twenty and the same order would have been received between the hundredth and nineteenth family
 lekin aamadani badhane kii jyamitiya dar bataa rahi thi ki tisven sthaan kaa parivaar biswein sthaan vaale parivaar se das fisadi zyaada kama rahaa tha jabaki pachaasawein sthaan kaa parivaar chalisven sthaan ke parivaar se pachaas fisadi zyaada or sauven sthaan vaala parivaar nabbewein sthaan vaale parivaar se sau fisadi zyaada kama rahaa tha
 Pareto looked at income distribution in the United States and many European countries and found that the state of inequality is almost the same as a pattern
 isliye unhone ise niyam kii sangya di
 Pareto thought that the disparity would continue in this way because the Maldar people would not allow their political status to change this pattern of distribution
 parato ke is niyam se bahut vivaad paidaa hua, kyonki iske saath kai saamaajik-raajnneetik mudde jude hue the jin par vichaar karne se arthshaastri aam taur par kataraate rahete the
 However, Pareto's discovery also marked an important advancement in economic science
 parato se pehle kisi arthshaastri ne duniya ke bahut se deshon kii aamadaniyon ke aankadon kaa vishleshan nahin kiya tha
 By prioritizing ordinal utility over cardinal utility, Pareto urged economists not to expect too much from the consumer
 cardinal upyogita ke mutabik upabhokta se na keval yah ummid kii jaati thi ki vah ek vastu ke upar duusari ko praathamikta dena jaanata hoga, balki yah bhi jaanata hoga ki us praathamikta kii maatra kya hogi
 Whereas according to the principle of ordinal utility, the consumer should have been expected to give only priority
 vyavhaar main cardinal or ordenal upyogita ke bich antar is tarah samajha ja saktaa he : agar ek upabhokta ananas ke upar aam ko praathamikta detaa he, to usase yah jaanane kii apeksha karnaa galat hoga ki vah aam ko ananas se do sau fisadi upyogi maanata he yaa dedh sau fisadi
 Consumer buying behavior does not provide any such information
 parato ke is aagrah kaa parinaam yah hua ki vibhinn logon dwaara grahan kii jane vaali upyogita ko naapnaa zaruri nahin rah gaya
 The philosophy of utilitarianism developed by Jeremy Bentham and James Stuart Mill suffered from this confusion
 parato ke sutrikaran kaa nateeja yah hua ki upyogita naapane kaa paimaana banane kii koshishen hi ruk gayin
 Similarly, the attitude of comparing utility in interpersonal relationships was also abandoned
 yahi kaafii samajha jane laga ki agar do vyakti do chizon kaa vinimay kar rahe hai to ve jo de rahe hai uske mukaable unke liye praapt kii jane vaali chiz kii upyogita adhik he
 If this was not the case then why would they do this exchange
 parato kaa teesraa yogadan anukultam paristhiti ke siddhant ke rup main saamne aayaa
 While searching for the optimal state of economic affairs, Pareto came to the conclusion that some economic results could not be improved in any way
 agar kisi ek vyakti kii sthiti ko behatar kiya janaa he to uske liye kisi duusare vyakti kii sthiti ko kamatar karnaa hoga
 That is, there will be no improvement in the situation overall
 parato kaa kahana tha ki do vyakti tabhi koi len-dein karte hai jab donon ko faayde kii ummid ho
 If there is only one benefit, there will be no exchange
 aisi sthiti ke baavjood agar dabaav daal kar vastuon kaa punarvitaran karne kii koshish kii jaaegi to kul mila kar sthiti main yaa aarthik pradarshan main koi sudhaar nahin hoga
 Therefore, only the condition of free exchange in the market can be said to be optimal
 parato ke is siddhant ke nattejey nitigat kshetra main nikalne laazmi the
 It was also used for advocating welfare economics
 iske mutabik bina kisi kaa nuksaan kiye agar har vyakti kii behatari ho sake to aarthik kalyaan main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 In order to create this optimum condition, it is imperative that producers change their production at the same marginal rate at which the substitution of consumption is done at the level of consumers
 parato ke anusaar keval aisa hone par hi sabhi utpaadan prakriyaaon kii seemaant laagat seemaant aamadani ke baraabar ho sakati he
 On the other hand, economists in the thirties also thought that economic performance could be evaluated through this theory of circumstance without resorting to price discretion
 isliye unhone is prashn par kaafii dimaag khapaaya or yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main yah usul kargar hone se chukta to nahin he
 This principle of Pareto is used to give tax concessions to the rich: if the rich people get these concessions, then they will be able to invest more and there will be an economic boom and the poor will also get better as a result
 is sthiti main ise parato-superior kii sangya di jaaegi
 If there is no economic boom due to tax concessions, then the revenue will have to be repaid from someone's pocket
 maldaaron ko faaydaa hoga or aam aadmi kii jeb khaali hogi
 This would be considered pareto-optimal
 parato optimal kii aalochana karte hue amartya sen ne daawa kiya he ki is siddhant se nikalne vaale nattejey mulya-tatasth yaa vaigyanik nahin kahe ja sakate
 This theory is based on the assumption that if a change makes a person happy, then society as a whole is happy
 is manyata ko sahi nahin mana ja saktaa
 Secondly, this theory is not credible under all circumstances
 masalan, akaal kii sthiti kaayade se parato optimal he or janata ko bhukhmaree se bachaane ke liye kiya gaya punarvitaran parato optimal ke kilaaf chalaa jayega

 According to the Supreme Court ruling, no more than 50% reservation can be made, but some states like Rajasthan have proposed 68% reservation, including 14% reservation for forward castes

 The oldest criterion for identifying under-represented groups is caste

 The fundamental principle is that under-representation of identifiable groups is a legacy of the Indian caste system
 bharat kii swatantraaa prapti ke baad bharat ke samvidhan ne pehle ke kuch samoohon ko anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke rup main soochibaddh kiya
 The framers of the Constitution believed that due to the caste system, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes remained historically backward and were not given respect and equal opportunities in Indian society and hence their share in nation-building activities was low

 An additional complication is that some castes / communities that are considered untouchables in one province but not in other provinces
 paramparaagat vyavsaayon ke aadhaar par kuch jatiyon ko hindu or gaiyr-hindu donon samudaayon main sthaan praapt he
 Listing of castes has a long history, beginning with the early period of our history with Manu

 31 seat list is used as non-reserved open entry list and 69 seats are filled using 69% reservation
 The effective reservation percentage depends on how many non-reserved category students fall in the list of 50 and not in the 31 list
 At one extreme, all 19 may be non-reserved category students, in which case the total reservation becomes 58%; It can also be argued that by considering it as 19% 'reservation' for non-reserved category students it becomes / 119 or 74%! At the other extreme, in the list of 31, no 19 are added to the non-reserved category, then no super-numbered seats will be created in this case and 69% reservation will be done as per the state law order

 yah maatr pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he tathaa parloukik sattaaon ko yah siddhant sweekaar nahin karata he
 This philosophy is also called Vedabhya
 vedabaahya darshan chha: hai- charvak, madhyamik, yogachaar, sautrantik, vaibhashik, or arhat
 In all these, there is a rendering of principles unrelated to the Veda
 ajit keshakambali ko charvak ke agradoot ke rup main shrey diya jaataa he, jabaki brihaspati ko aamtaur par charvak yaa lokayat darshan ke sansthaapak ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Most of the primary literature of the Charvaka, Jupiter Sutra, is missing or lost
 isaki shikshaaon ko aitihaasik madhyamik sahitya se sankalit kiya gaya he jaise ki shaastra, sutara, or bhartiya mahakavy kavita main or gautam buddha ke samvaad or jain sahitya se
 Charvak was an atheist and atheist logical of ancient India
 ye naastik mat ke pravartak brihaspati ke shishy maane jate hai
 Nothing is known about when Jupiter and Charvak happened
 brihaspati ko chanakya ne apane arthshaastra granth main arthshaastra kaa ek pradhan acharya mana he
 On hearing the name of Charvak, you will remember 'jeeva jeevat sukham jeevat, loan kritva, ghritam peewat' The name 'charvak' has been changed to abusive abusive language
 maanon is siddhant ko maanane vaale sirf karjkhor, bhogavaadi or patit log the
 The prevailing belief is that the word Charvak originated from 'charu' + 'speech'
 zaahir he ki yah namakaran is siddhant ke un virodhiyon dwaara kiya gaya he ki jinka maananaa tha ki yah log mithi-mithi baton se bhole-bhale logon ko bahakaate the
 The term 'lokayat' is used even in Buddhist Pitas for Charvaka doctrines which means 'the system of philosophy which believes in this folk and does not believe in the concept of heaven, hell or liberation'
 Charvak or Lokayat philosophy is also mentioned in Mahabharata, but no original text is available
 zaahir he ki chunki yah apane samay kii sattadhari takaton ke khilaaf baat karata tha, to iske granthon ko nasht kar diya gaya or prachlit kathaon main charvaakon ko khalnaayakon kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 Charvak's vote is found in Sarvadarshan Sangraha
 padmapurana main likhaa he ki asuron ko bahakaane ke liye brihaspati ne vedaviruddh mat prakat kiya tha
 In relation to the atheist faith, it is written in Vishnupurana that when the demons became very strong with the power of religion, then the gods called on Vishnu
 vishnu ne apane sharir se mayamoh naamak ek purush utpann kiya jisane narmada tat par digbanr rup main jaakar tap karte hue asuron ko bahakaakar dharmamarg main bhrasht kiya
 What Mayamoh preached to the Asuras is very similar to the verses of the Charvak faith given in the Sarvadarsanasangraha
 jaise, - mayamoh ne kaha he ki yadi yajna main maaraa hua pashu swarg jaataa he to yajmaan apane pita ko kyon nahin maar daalata, ityadi
 In the context of Tripuravinash in Lingpuran, there is also a story of a Digambar Muni, inspired by Shiva, being seduced by asuras in a similar way, which aims at the Jains
 valmiki ramayana ayodhya kandamen maharishi jawali ne ramchandra ko banbaas chhod ayodhya laut jane ke liye jo upadesh diya he vah bhi charvak ke mat se bilkul miltaa he
 All these things prove that atheism is very ancient
 iskaa avirbhaav usee samay main samajhnaa chahie jav vaidic karmkaandon kii adhikta logon ko kuch khatakane lagi thi
 Charvak does not believe in God and the hereafter
 paralok na maanane ke kaaran hi inke darshan ko lokayat bhi kehete hai
 Happiness is the main goal of this life in the Sarvadarshan Sangraha by the opinion of Charvaka
 sansar main dukh bhi he, yah samajhakar jo sukh nahin bhogana chaahate, ve murkh hai
 If a fish has thorns, does it not eat any fish? The foursome will go to the field, fearing that no field should be sown? And so on
 charvak aatma ko pruthak koi padaarth nahin maanate
 According to their opinion, alcohol is produced in alcohol due to the combination of jaggery, tandul etc
 Similarly, consciousness is generated by the combination of these four ghosts like earth, water, light and air
 inke vishleshan yaa vinaash se 'main' arthath chetanta kaa bhi naash ho jaataa he
 There is no return etc
 after the name of this conscious body
 ishwar, paralok aadi vishay anumaan ke aadhaar par hai
 But Charvak does not take the inference into evidence except direct
 unka tark he ki anumaan vyaptigyaan kaa ashrith he
 The name of the knowledge that is passed on to us through the senses is extended to the past and future, which is impossible
 man main yah gyaan pratyaksh hota he, yah koi pramaan nahin kyonki man apane anubhav ke liye indriyon kaa hi ashrith he
 If you say that there is prevalence of knowledge through inference, then the error of error comes, because you want to prove the conjecture only on prevalence
 charvak kaa mat sarvadarshansangrah, sarvadarshanshiromani or brihaspatisutra main dekhnaa chahie
 This opinion is also mentioned in the 17th canto of Naishadh
 charvak keval pratyakshvadita kaa samarthan karata he, vah anumaan aadi pramaanon ko nahin maanata he
 In his opinion, the earth is water fast and air is the only four elements from which everything is made
 uske mat main akaash tatv kii sthiti nahin he, inhi chaaron tatwon ke mail se yah deh bani he, inke vishesh prakaar ke sangyojan maatr se deh main chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he, jisko log aatma kehete he
 When the body is destroyed, Chaitanya also disappears
 is prakaar se jeev in bhuto se utpann hokar inhi bhuto ke ke nasht hote hi samaapt ho jaataa he, aage peeche iskaa koi mahatv nahin he
 Therefore, the body that is seen in the conscious is the form of a soul, there is no evidence to be an additional soul from the body
 charvak ke mat se stri putr or apane kutumbiyon se milane or unke dwaara diye jane vaale sukh hi sukh kehalaate he
 To embrace them is to make effort, to eat and live happily in the world
 is darshan main kaha gaya he, ki:- Meaning that as long as you want to live, you should live happily, if you do not have the means, then you should have fun by borrowing from another, who has seen the body come back after burning of the body in the crematorium? charvak darshan ke anusaar prithvi, jal, tej tathaa vaayu ye chaar hi tatva sristi ke mul kaaran hai
 Just like Buddhist, Charvak also believes that there is no element called Akash
 yah shunya maatr he
 Upon coming from its molecular state to the gross state, the above four elements are seen as external world, sense or body
 akaash kii vastvatmak satta na maanane ke peeche inaki pramaan vyavastha kaaran he
 Just as we experience their smell, smell, form and touch, we also express their relatives through senses
 akaash tatva kaa vaisaa pratyaksh nahin hota
 Therefore, there is no element called Akash in their opinion
 chaar mahabhuton kaa mulkaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvaakon ke paas nahin he
 This world is just a collection or collision of four mahabhutas found in different forms and in different quantities
 charvaakon ke anusaar chaar mahabhuton se atirikt aatma naamak koi anya padaarth nahin he
 Chaitanya is the quality of the soul
 chunki aatma naamak koi vastu he hi nahin at: chaitanya sharir kaa hi gun yaa dharm siddh hota he
 That is, this body is the soul
 isaki siddhi ke teen prakaar he-tark, anubhav or ayurveda shaastra
 For the attainment of the soul by logic, the Charvak people say that the living remains conscious and the absence of the body does not remain conscious
 is anvay vyatirek se sharir hi chaitanya kaa aadhaar arthath aatma siddh hota he
 Experience 'I am gross', 'I am weak', 'I am fair', 'I am inactive' etc
 We experience on foot
 sthulata durbalata ityadi sharir ke dharm hai or 'main' bhi vahi he
 Therefore, the body is the soul
 ayurveda jis prakaar good, jau, mahua aadi ko mila dene se kaal kram ke anusaar us mishran main madshakt utpann hoti he, athwa dahi pili mitti or gobar ke paraspar mishran se usamen bichchhu paidaa ho jaataa he athwa paan, kattha, supaari or chuunaa main laal rang na rahane par bhi unke mishran se munh main laalimaa utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar chaturbhuton ke vishisht sammishran se chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he
 But what is the reason for mixing of these ghosts in specific amounts? The answer to this question is nothing but Charvak
 ishwar-nyaay aadi shastron main ishwar kii siddhi anumaan yaa aapt vachan se kii jaati he
 Since Charvak considers direct and only direct evidence, the only visible king in his opinion is God, he is the controller of his kingdom and the subjects living in it
 at: use hi ishwar maananaa chaiye
 Theorem means accurate knowledge of the subject, that is, proof is required for prama
 charvak lok keval pratyaksh pramaan maanate hai
 Knowledge arising out of the proximity of subject and senses is called direct knowledge
 hamaari indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh dikhalaayi padane vaala sansar hi prameya he
 Other than this, other substances are discrete
 aankh, kaan, naak, jihva or twachaa ke dwaara rup shabd gandh ras evam sparsh kaa pratyaksh ham sabko hota he
 There is no need for any other evidence for an object which is not empirical
 buddha, jain naamak avaidic darshan tathaa nyayavaisheshik aadi ardhvaidic darshan anumaan ko bhi pramaan maanate hai
 He says that the power of all theorems cannot be proved by direct evidence
 parantu charvak kaa kathan he ki anumaan se keval sambhaavna paidaa kii ja sakati he
 Cognitive knowledge is direct
 duurastha hare bhare vrikshon ko dekhakar vahaan pakshiyon kaa kolahal sunakar, udhar se aane vaali hawa ke thande jhoke se ham vahaan pani kii sambhaavna maanate hai
 The achievement of water is determined by going there and seeing it directly
 at: sambhaavna utpann karne tathaa lokvyavahaar chalaane ke liye anumaan aavashyak hota he kintu vah pramaan nahin ho saktaa
 The prevalence on the basis of which the presumption is considered the power of proof is nothing but coverage
 dhooma ke saath agni kaa, pushp ke saath gandh kaa hona swabhaav he
 Happiness and sorrow of religion and the working sense of unrighteousness are natural
 jaise kokil ke shabd main madhurata tathaa kauwe ke shabd main karkashta swaabhaavik he usee prakaar sarvatra samajhnaa chaiye
 As far as word proof is concerned, it is a kind of direct proof
 aapt purush ke vachan hamako pratyaksh sunaayi dete hai
 Listening to them makes sense
 yah pratyaksh hi he
 As far as the Vedas are concerned, their sentences describe uninteresting and inauspicious topics, so their credibility is relevant
 saath hi adharm aadi main ashwalingagrahan sadrush lajjaspad evam mansabhakshan sadrush ghrinaaspad kaary karne se tathaa jarbhari turfari aadi arthhin shabdon kaa prayog karne se veda apni apramanikta swayan siddh karte hai
 From the above description it becomes clear that the Charvak people do not accept anything other than this directly visible body and world
 dharm, arth, kaam or moksh naamak purusharthchatushtay ko ve log purush arthath manushya deh ke liye upyogi maanate hai
 In his view, meaning and work are the ultimate effort
 dharm naam kii vastu ko maananaa morrkhtaa he kyonki jab is sansar ke atirikt koi anya swarg aadi he hi nahin to dharm ke fal ko swarg main bhogane kii baat anargal he
 It is not religion to perform the yajna etc
 to enjoy the happiness of heaven conceived by the hypocritical rascals, but it is unrighteous due to animal violence, etc
 It is the misuse of things, and the misuse of things and suffering of the waste body
 He should do the same to bring happiness to the body
 jisamen indriyon kii tripti ho man andith ho vahi kaary karnaa chaiye
 Those who are satisfied with the senses should rejoice and those subjects should be consumed
 sharir indriya man ko anandaplavit karne main jo tatva baadhak hote hai unako dur karnaa, na karnaa, maar dena dharm he
 To endure physical mental distress, to force the mind and body from contentment is wrong
 taatpary yah he ki aastik vaidic evam yahan tak ki ardhvedic darshanon main, puraanon smritiyon main varnit aachaar kaa paalan yadi sharir sukh kaa sadhak he to unka anusaran karnaa chaiye or yadi ve uske baadhak hote hai to unka sarvatha sarvada tyaag kar dena chaiye
 The imagination of salvation of the Charvakas is also strongly influenced by the influence of their element, the epistemology and the knowledge epistemology
 jab tak sharir he tab tak manushya naanaa prakaar ke ksht sahataa he
 This is hell
 is ksht samooh se mukti tab milti he jab deh chaitanyarahit ho jaataa he arthath mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body dies experiencing any suffering
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav nahin hota
 Although in other philosophies, the existence of the soul is acknowledged to be free and the nature of salvation is different in different philosophies, yet the Charvakas do not support their belief
 ve na to moksh ko nity maanate hue sanmaatr maanate hai, na nity maanate hue sat or chit swaroop maanate hai na hi ve sachchidanand swaroop main uski sthiti ko hi moksh sweekaar karte hai
 Charvak philosophy is a philosophy that is naturally beloved by the common man
 jis darshan ke vaakya chaaru arthath ruchikar hon vah charvak darshan he
 The practical and temporal antecedent of all classical serious subjects is the Charvak philosophy
 sahaj rup main jo kuch ham karte hai vah sab kuch charvak darshan kaa aadhaar he
 Charvak Darshan looks at every aspect of life with ease
 jivan ke prati yah sahaj drushti hi charvak darshan he
 The reality is that every human life that lives in the world is a Charvak philosophy
 aise vaakya or siddhanth jo sabko romantic lagen lok main aayat yaa vishrut aavashya honge
 Probably this is the reason why we also know Charvak philosophy as Lokayat philosophy
 yah darshan barhospaty darshan ke naam se bhi vidwaanon main prasiddh he
 From this name, it appears that this philosophy is opposed by Jupiter
 brihaspati bhartiya samaaj main devataaon ke guru ke rup main maanya hai
 But Jupiter is not one in Indian literature
 charvak darshan ke pravartak acharya brihaspati koun hai, yah nirnay kar paanaa atyant kathin kaary he
 The mention of two Brihaspati in Aigaras and Laukya forms is found in the Rigveda
 ashwaghosh ke anusaar anigaras brihaspati rajshastra ke praneta hai
 The origin of the true substance is believed to be from Asat in the opinion of Laukya Jupiter
 isi prakaar asat padaarth kii utpatti sat se maani gayi he
 The roots are called discrete
 chetan padaarthon ko is manyata ke anusaar sat kaha jaataa hai
 The instruction of a Jupiter is also found in the Van Parva of Mahabharata
 yah brihaspati shukr kaa swaroop dhaaran kar indra kaa sarankshan evam daanvon kaa vinaash karne ke uddeshy se anaatmavaad yaa prapanch vigyaan kii sanrachana karata he
 As a result of this great science, considering the auspicious as inauspicious and inauspicious, demons get involved in criticism and blasphemy of Vedas and scriptures
 anya prasang main mahabharat main hi ek or brihaspati kaa varnan miltaa he jo shukracharya ke saath mil kar pravanchanashastra kii rachana karte hai
 If the teachers of various scriptures are to be believed, then the Charvak faith cannot be considered in the category of philosophy because in this philosophy, the work of deception is done only in the guise of sweet words
 yah baat or he ki yadi charvak kii sunen to vah bhi vibhinn shastragyon ko vanchak hi ghoshit karata he
 a description of such a Jupiter is found in the Taittriya Brahmana text that strikes the forehead of Gayatri Devi, Gayatri Devi has been considered as the origin of all the Vedas according to the Padma Purana
 is drushti se yah brihaspati veda kaa virdohi mana ja saktaa he
 Possibly because of opposing the Vedas, it would be reasonable to consider this Jupiter as the leader of the Charvak philosophy
 vishnu puraana main bhi brihaspati kaa prasang praapt hota he
 According to this belief of Jupiter, the Vedic ritual is practiced by the expenditure and effort of polygamy
 vividh sukh ke sadhak ye vaidic upaay kuch arth lolup swaarth kendrit dhurton kaa hi vidhaan he
 a description of the logical Jupiter is also found somewhere
 ye brihaspati veda ke anugami to avashya hai par tarksmmat anushthanon kaa hi samarthan karte hai
 From their point of view, the decision must be based on scripture, but it is absolutely necessary to maintain this classical research logic
 tark virahit chintan dharm ke nirdhaaran main kabhi bhi sarthak nahin ho saktaa he
 Vatsyayana Muni has mentioned Jupiter as the author of Arthashastra in his world famous book Kamasutra
 brihaspati dwaara virachit arthshaastra ke ek sutara ke anusaar shaastra ke rup main maatr lokayat ko hi manyata di gayi he
 As a result, it is very difficult to distinguish between Jupiter, the pioneer of economics and the originator of Lokayata Shastra
 kuch samalochakon ne arthshaastra ke evam lokayat shaastra ke nirmaataa ko abhinn maanane ke saath-saath kamasutron ke praneta bhi brihaspati hi hai, yah mana he
 If the fulfillment of cosmic desires is the aim of Charvak philosophy, then the founder of Kamasastra, Muni Vatsyayan, is Jupiter, it is only appropriate to believe
 kautilya ne arthshaastra main lokayat darshan kaa sahaj pratipaadan kiya he
 In this way, Kautilya, the creator of Arthashastra and Jupiter, the proponent of Lokayat philosophy, is the same
 koshkaar hemachandra ke anusaar arthshaastra, kamasutra, nyayasutra-bhashya, panchatantra evam chanakya niti ke rachayita ek hi he
 After such deliberation, the names of the Jupiter which are discussed in various contexts in Vedic Vamāya are clearly explained in this way
 padam puraana ke sandarbh main angira brahma ke maanas putr hai
 Angiras Brihaspati is the son of Angira and grandson of Brahma
 falat: inaki devon main gananaa hoti he
 In this way, there can be no distinction between Dev Guru Jupiter and Angiras Jupiter
 devon kii sangraksha ke liye devataaon ke guru dwaara asuron ko pradutt upadesh vibhinn lokon main aayat ho gaya yah kathan dev guru brihaspati ke sandarbh main vishwasaneey nahin ho saktaa
 Why would Asuras respect the teachings of Devguru under his guru Shukracharya? Therefore, no one is expected to be the originator of Charvaka philosophy other than Devguru
 kuch samalochakon ne spasht rup se sweekaar kiya he ki charvak ke guru brihaspati, swarg ke swami indra ke acharya vishwavikhyath brihaspati nahin hai
 This Brihaspati is the guru of a royal family
 aitihaasik drushti se denkhe to vasishtha, vishwamitra, dronacharya aadi kaa kisi rajkul kaa guru hona is manyata ko aadhaar bhi de rahaa he
 Just as Shankara philosophy is accepted as Shiromani in theistic philosophies, similarly the Charvak philosophy is undisputed as Shiromani as the most outstanding atheist among the atheist philosophies
 naastik shiromani charvak isliye bhi mana jaataa he ki vah vishwa main vishwaas ke aadhaar par kisi na kisi rup main maanya ishwar kii alokik sarvamaanya satta ko sire se nakaar detaa he
 According to them, there is no object named God in the world
 naastik shiromani charvak jo kuch bahari indriyon se dikhaai detaa he anubhoot hota he, usee kii satta ko sweekaar karata he
 This is the reason that no other proof is considered in the theory of Charvak except for the direct evidence
 jis ishwar kii kalpana anya darshanon main kii gai he uski satta pratyaksh pramaan se sambhav nahin he
 According to their opinion, it is unnecessary and laughable to assume the role of God in the seedling that emerges from the seed
 ankur kii utpatti to mitti evam jal ke sanyog se nitant swaabhaavik evam sahaj prakriya se sarvanubhav siddh he
 Approval of an unseen actor to complete this natural work is meaningless
 ishwar ko na maanane par jeev saamaanya ke shubh evam ashubh karmon ke fal kii vyavastha kaise sambhav hogi? is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak poochta he ki kis karm fal kii vyavastha apekshit? sansar main do prakaar ke karm dekhe jate hai
 One is cosmic and the other is supernatural action
 kya aap loukik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sambandh main chintit hai? yadi haan, to yah chintaa anaavashyak he
 Legislative deeds result in legislation, which is the only accepted king or administrator in the world
 yah sarvanubhav siddh tathy, pratyaksh hi he
 We see that the charitable deeds, etc
, prohibit those who perform the prohibited work, by sending them the proper fruits of their misdeeds, as Lok Siddha Raja, in the prison etc
 as punishment
 isi prakaar kisi kii praan raksha aadi shubh karm karne vaale purush ko raja hi puraskaar rup main sufal arthath dhan dhaany evam sammaan se vibhooshit kar detaa he
 If you are truthful about the arrangement of the fruits of supernatural actions, then you should not worry too
 kyonki parloukik fal kii drushti se vihit ye sabhi yajna, puja, paath tapasya aadi vaidic karm jan saamaanya ko thagne kii drushti se tathaa apni aajeevika evam udar ke bharan poshan ke liye kuch dhurton dwaara kalpit hue hai
 In fact, Agnihotra, the three Vedas, the wearing of Tridand and the devouring of Bhasma from place to place in the body are the only sign of wisdom and effortlessness
 in vaidic karmon kaa fal aaj tak kisi ko bhi drushti gochar nahin hua he
 If Vedic deeds had any fruit, it would have been evident to someone till date
 at: aaj tak kisi ko bhi in vaidic yaa varnashram-vyavastha se sambaddh karmon kaa fal-swarg, moksh, devloak gaman aadi pratyaksh anubhuti nahin he at: ye samast vaidic karm nishphal hi hai, yah swat: yukti purvak siddh ho jaataa he
 Here if the believer says that the trade that proves the heavens etc
 is unseen or religion and unrighteousness which leads to the attainment of heaven, then it is not acceptable to Charvak
 alokik adrusht kaa khandan karte hue charvak swarg aadi paralok ke saadhan main adrusht kii bhoomika ko nirast karata he tathaa is prakaar aastik darshan ke mul par hi kutharaghaat kar detaa he
 This is the reason that along with the abrogation of heaven and heaven, which is proven on the basis of the unseen, as well as the regulator or administrator of this unseen, the God also becomes spontaneous in the Charvak faith
 charvak mat main koi jeev sharir se bhinn nahin he
 The body is the soul or soul
 falat: sharir kaa vinaash jab mrityu ke uparant dah sanskaar hone ke baad ho jaataa he tab jeev yaa jeevatma bhi vinasht ho jaataa he
 The solution of four or five mahabhutas in the body is the reason for enlightenment
 yah jeev mrityu ke anantar paralok jaataa he yah manyata bhi, sharir ko hi chetan yaa aatma sweekaar karne se niraadhaar hi siddh hoti he
 Even the ultimate effort of salvation as defined in the scriptures does not accept Charvaka
 chetan sharir kaa naash hi is mat main moksh he
 Due to the absence of religion and unrighteousness, there is no invisible heaven and hell, fruit etc
 in the Charvak theory, it is proved unintended
 charvak mat main sharir ko hi aatma maan lene par baalyavastha main anubhoot kanduk kreedaa aadi kaa vriddhavastha yaa yuvavastha main samaran kaise hota he? yah ek jvalant prashn sahaj hi uth khadaa hota he
 It cannot be said here that the body of childhood, the body of old age and the body of youth are the same
 yadi teenon avasthaaon kaa sharir ek hi hota to in teenon avasthaaon ke shariron main itnaa bada antar nahin hota
 From the difference, it is clearly proved that the components of the body which are meat bodies etc
 increase and decrease
 tathaa in hraas evam vruddhi ke kaaran hi baalyavastha ke sharir kaa naash evam yuvavastha ke sharir kii utpatti hoti he yah bhi siddh hota he
 If you say that this is the same body in the body of puberty, because of this behavior, the above remembrance can be generated by considering the body as one, then this statement also cannot be justified
 kyonki yah vahi sharir he yah pratybhigyaan to swaroop evam akruti kii samanta ke kaaran hota he
 As a result, the bodies of both the states cannot be considered integral
 aisi sthiti main purv darshit balya-kaal ke samaran ko sampann karne ke liye charvak balykaal ke sharir main utpann krida se janya sanskaar duusare yuva-kaal ke sharir main apane jaise hi naye sanskaar paidaa kar dete hai
 In the same way, the rites existing in the body of puberty produce the same rites in the body of old age
 etavata in baalyavastha ke sanskaron ke udbodhan se charvak mat main samaran bina kisi baadha ke ho jaataa he
 After all, in Charvak philosophy, the body is the soul, it proves to be natural
 yadi sharir hi aatma he to charvak se yah poocha ja saktaa he ki 'mam shariram' yah meraa sharir he, aisa loksiddh jo vyavhaar he vah kaise utpann hoga? is vyavhaar se to yah prathit ho rahaa he ki sharir alag he evam sharir kaa swami koi or he, jo sharir se bhinn aatma hi he
 Addressing this question, Charvak says that even though the head of a particular demon has been called Rahu, the common man 'rahu's head' behaves in a very natural way, in the same way that the body itself is a soul
 This popular practice will also be born as 'my body'
 charvaakon main kuch charvak indriyon ko hi aatma maanane par indriya ke nasht hone par samaran kii aapatti kaa niraas nahin ho paata he
 Some charvakas have also considered soul and mind as soul
 sharir hi aatma he yah siddh karne ke liye charvak is veda ke sandarbh ko bhi aastikon ke santosh ke liye prastut karata he
 This Vedic text implies that 'a spirit with science originates from these ghosts and finally merges with these ghosts
 yah bhuton main sharir swaroop aatma kaa vilay hi mrityu he
 ' yah vishalkay buddha pratimaa buddha tirth or paryaton margon main se ek bodhgaya, bihar main he

 Not only this, scholars have also considered Sankhya, Yoga and Mimamsa as ancient to Buddha
 sambhav he ki ye darshan vartmaan rup main us samay na hon, tathaapi ve kisi rup main avashya vidyaman the
 Vaiseshika Darshan is also probably older than Buddha; Because just as in today's era, justice and Vaiseshika are considered similar systems, similarly earlier meat and Vaiseshika were considered
 buddhadarshan paddati kaa aavirbhaav isa se purv do sau varsh mana jaataa he, parantu jain darshan, buddha darshan se bhi pracheen thahartaa he
 In this confirmation, it is given proof that neither the Buddhist philosophy nor the Hindu philosophy is available in ancient Jain philosophies

 Yajna and Devopasana were the basic forms of Vedic religion
 vedon kii bhaavana uttarkalin darshanon ke samaan sanyasapradhan nahin he
 In the Vedantras, faith in life and the euphoria of life is steeped
 jagat kii asatyata kaa vedamantron main abhas nahin he
 The Rigveda has adequate values of temporal values

 Darshan has been a very ancient tradition in Hinduism
 vaidic darshanon main shaddarshan adhik prasiddh or pracheen hai
