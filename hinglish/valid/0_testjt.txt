1937 'salim is the personification of the educated Indian and interests me a great deal
 He is excellent at his own theoretical subjects, but has no practical ability, and at everyday little problems is hopelessly inefficient


 His views are astounding
 He is prepared to turn the British out of India tomorrow and govern the country himself
 i have repeatedly told him that the British Government have no intention of handing over millions of uneducated Indians to the mercy of such men as Salim:


 Salim Ali's early surveys found both support and support for his wife Tehmina, and he broke down after his wife died in 1939 after a minor surgery
 1939 main tahmeena kii mrityu ke baad, saalim ali apni bahan kammo or bahanoi ke saath rahane lage

" shaayad aap hi iske bare main use samajha sakate hai
 "ali himself wrote to Ripley complaining about bird classification: baad main ali ne likhaa ki unki dilchaspee "prakritik paryaavaran main jivit pakshi main he

 Although once a fan of hunting literature, Ali's views on hunting remained strong, but he continued to collect bird specimens for scientific study
 unke apane vichaar the ki vanya jeev sangrakshan ke abhyaas ko vyaavhaarikta kii aavashyaktaa he or use ahimsa jaise darshan par aadhaarit nahin karnaa chahie
 He said that this fundamental religious sentiment was a hindrance in the development of bird studies in India
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics

 ek mat ke anusaar prarambh main brahma ke paanch sir the
 Brahma used to perform Vedpath with his three heads and abused Veda with two heads so that Shiva cut off one of his heads
 brahma daksh ke pita the
 So Daksha became angry and started talking to Shiva for revenge
 lekin yah mat anya pramanik sandarbhon se khandit ho jaataa he
 In the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana it is clearly described that Brahma had only four heads at the time of birth
 duusare mat ke anusaar shakti dwaara swayan bhavishyavaanee rup main daksh se swayan ke bhagwaan shiv kii patni hone kii baat kah diye jane ke baavjood daksh shiv ko sati ke anuroop nahin maanate the
 So, when Sati was married, she organized a swayamvara for him and did not call Shiva in it
 phir bhi sati ne 'shivaay namah' kahkar varmala prithvi par daal di or vahaan prakat hokar bhagavan shiv ne varmala grahan karke sati ko apni patni banaakar kailash chale gayi
 Thus Daksha did not like Shiva because of his daughter Sati choosing Shiva as her husband against her will
 teesraa mat sarvaadhik prachlit he
 According to this, on the arrival of Daksha in a yajna of Prajapati, all the gods got up and respected him, but Shiva also remained seated with Brahma ji
 shiv ko apana jamata arthath putr samaan hone ke kaaran unke dwaara khadey hokar aadar nahin diye jane se daksh ne apana apmaan mahasoos kiya or unhone shiv ke prati katuctiyon kaa prayog karte hue ab se unhen yajna main devataaon ke saath bhaag na milane kaa shaap de diya
 Thus both of them became psychotic
 ukt ghatana ke baad prajapati daksh ne apni rajdhani kankhal main ek viraat yajna kaa aayojan kiya, jisamen unhone apane jamata shiv or putree sati ko yajna main aane hetu nimantrit nahin kiya
 Even after Shankar ji's explanation, Sati went without calling her father's yagna
 yajyasthal main daksh prajapati ne sati or shankar ji kaa ghor niraadar kiya
 Unable to bear the insult Sati immediately consumed herself with Yogagni in the sacrificial fire
 sati kii mrityu kaa samachar paakar bhagavan shankar ne virbhadra ko utpann kar uske dwaara us yajna kaa vidhwans kara diya
 Virbhadra also beheaded the head of Daksha Prajapati while giving appropriate punishment to the gods and sages who were opposing and ridiculing Lord Shiva
 baad main brahma ji ke dwaara prarthana kiye jane par bhagavan shankar ne daksh prajapati ko uske sir ke badale main bakre kaa sir pradaan kar uske yajna ko sampann karavaaya
 There are clearly three stages in the development of the story of daksha-yajna-demolition
 is katha ke pratham charan kaa rup mahabharat ke shantiparv main he
 This primary form of the story also supports Daksha's sacrifice performed in Kankhal
 yahan kankhal main yajna hone kaa spasht ullekh to nahin he, parantu gangadwar ke desh main yajna hona ullikhit he or kankhal gangadwar ke antargat hi aata he
 In this story, Yajna of Daksha is destroyed but Sati is not consumed
 vastutah sati kailash par apane pati bhagwaan shankar ke paas hi rahati he or apane pita daksh dwaara unhen nimantran tathaa yajna main bhaag nahin diye jane par atyadhik vyakul rahati he
 Due to his distraction, Shiva generates Veerabhadra from his mouth and he goes with the ganas to destroy the yagna
 parantu, na to virbhadra daksh kaa sir katata he or na hi use bhasma karata he
 Naturally, there is no question of adding a goat's head
 vastutah is katha main 'yajna' kaa sir kaatane arthath puri tarah 'yajna' ko nasht kar dene kii baat kahi gayi he, jise baad kii kathaon main 'daksh' kaa sir kaatane se jod diya gaya
 In this legend Daksha praises Shiva by 1008 names and Lord Shiva is pleased and gives him a boon
 is katha ke vikaas ke duusare charan kaa rup shrimadbhagwat mahapurana se lekar shiv puraana tak main varnit he
 In this, Sati stubbornly indulges in Yajna and gets angry and is consumed by Yogagni
 swaabhaavik he ki jab sati yogagni main bhasma ho jaati he to unki laash kahaan se bachegi ! isliye unki laash lekar shivaji ke bhatakane aadi kaa prashn hi nahin uthta he
 No such indication is found at this stage of the narrative
 is katha main virbhadra shivaji kii jataa se utpann hota he tathaa daksh kaa sir kaat kar jala detaa he
 As a result, the head of the goat is added to it
 katha ke vikaas ke tisare charan kaa rup devipurana jaise uppurana main varnit hua he
 In which Sati is burnt and the Yajna of Daksha is also destroyed by Virabhadra
 yahan virbhadra shivaji ke tisare netra se utpann hota he tathaa daksh kaa sir bhi kaata jaataa he
 Then Shiva ji is happy to praise and Daksha is also alive and Virabhadra adds the head of a goat to him
 parantu, yahan puranakar katha ko or aage badhaate hai tathaa baad main bhagwaan shiv ko punah sati kii laash surakshit tathaa dedeepyaman rup main yajyashala main hi mil jaati he
 Then Shivji wanders like a deranged with that corpse and Lord Vishnu is gradually cut the corpse from the chakra in block-by-volume form
 is prakaar laash ke vibhinn angon ke vibhinn sthanon par girane se 51 shakti peethon kaa nirmaan hota he
 It is clear that it would have taken centuries or millennia until this third form of the story came
 is tarah sati ke sharir kaa jo hissaa or dhaaran kiye aabhushan jahaan-jahaan gire vahaan-vahaan shakti peeth astitv main aa gayi
 The number of Shaktipeeths is given in different texts
 tantrachudamani main shaktipeethon kii sankhya 52 bataai gayi he
 There are 108 Shaktipeeths mentioned in Devi Bhagwat, then 72 Shaktipeeths are mentioned in Devi Gita
 devipurana main 51 shaktipeethon kii charchaa kii gayi he
 Traditionally, there are 51 Shaktipeeths among the devotees and Sudhijans

 nautanki uttar bharat, pakistan or nepal ke ek lok nrity or naatak style kaa naam he
 It is a descendant of the ancient Swang tradition in the Indian subcontinent and is named after a famous dance drama called 'shehzadi Nautanki', based on a princess named 'nautanki', a historical from Multan
 nautanki or swang main sabase bada antar yah mana jaataa he ki jahaan swang zyaadaatar dharmik vishyon se tallok rakhata he or use thodi gambhirtha se pradarshit kiya jaataa he vahaan nautanki ke mauzu prem or vir-ras par aadhaarit hote hai or unamem vyangy or tanz mishrit kiye jate hai
 Beginning in Punjab, the style of gimmick became increasingly popular and spread throughout North India
 samaaj ke ucch-darje ke log ise 'sasta' or 'ashleel' samajhate the lekin yah lok-kala panapati gai
 Most critics agree that 'nautanki is an evolved form of farce style'
 nautanki ki kathaayen aksar kisi vyakti par yaa mahatvapurn vishay par hoti hai, masalan aalha-oodal kii nautanki
 Similarly, 'sultana dacoit' gimmick tells the story of a dacoit in Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh of the same name
 bharat ke swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan us vishay par bahut si nautankiyaan huin thi jinhonen jan-saadhaaran ko is sangram main shaamil hone kii prerana di
 Nowadays, gimmicks can be seen against dowry-malpractices, terrorism and communal fighting
 darshakon kii ruchi banaae rakhane ke liye nautankiyon main aksar prem-sambandh ke bhi kuch tatv hote hai jinka prayog ashleelata ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, many obscene gimmicks have also been going on for one and a half years, due to which the style of gimmick is often discredited
 parmparik rup se nautankiyon main paisa banane ke liye yah zaruri tha ki darshakon ko kabhi bhi oobane na diya jaae, isliye adhiktar nautankiyon main 10 minute yaa us se kam avadhi kii ghatnaon ko ek silsile main jodakar banaaya jaataa he jisamen har bhaag main darshakon kii ruchi banaae rakhane kii koshish kii jaati he
 To keep the story interesting, heroism, love, fun, song-dancing and religion are mixed and the narrator tries to keep the audience's feelings up and down constantly
 nautanki main kavita or saadhaaran bolchaal ko milaane kii pratha shuru se rahi he
 The characters talk among themselves but deep feelings and messages are often revealed through rhyme
 gane main saarangi, table, hormonium or nagaade jaise vaadya istemaal hote hai
 For example, in a form of 'sultana dacoit', Sultana explains to his girlfriend that he is born to help the poor and therefore robs the rich
 uski premika kahati he ki use sultanaa kii veerta par naaz he : Please note that traditional hindi-urdu words are often used in Nautanki

 Similarly, in words like 'poor' and 'gum', the pronunciation of the dotted 'g' is slightly different from the pointless 'g' and is found in words like 'wrong' and 'missing'
