 madrak ek jat gotra he
 The compounds obtained by the hydroxyl-amine reaction on aldehydes and ketones are called oximes
 aldihado se bane yogicon ko aldoxim tathaa kitonon se bane yogic kitoxim kehalaate hai
 Their sources are shown in the front figure
 oxim ve rasinic yogic hai jinka saamaanya sutara R1R2C=NOH he jisamen R1 koi carbonic chen he tathaa R2 yaa to hydrogen he jo eldaxim banaati he yaa koi doosraa carbonic samooh he jo kitoxim banaata he
 The first was built by Axim Victor Mayer in 1878 AD
 iske baad aldihide tathaa kitonon ke shuddhikaran tathaa unki pahchaan main oxymon ke mahatv ke kaaran tathaa in yogicon kii vinyas-samavyawata ke kaaran, rasayanagyon ne inke adhyayan main vishesh ruchi dikhalaai, jiske falswaroop inase sambhddha inek mahatvapurn anusandhan hue
 The specific reason for their use in the purification and detection of aldehydes and ketones is that oximes are soluble in solid state and insoluble in water; Therefore, they can be achieved in a pure state
 hydrochloric yaa gandhakaml ke vilyan ke saath garam karne se oxymon kaa jalavishleshan ho jaataa he
 As a result, aldehydes or ketones are recovered in an independent state
 oxymon ke apchayan se praathmik amin praapt haate hai at: -C-OCO-C-NH main parivartit karne main inkaa prayog hota he
 Aldaxim can be dehydrated by acid chloride, which makes some oximes, combined with metallic elements, to form permanent subclasses
 lagbhag ek samaan gunwale or sambandhti vividh tatwon se is prakaar bananevaale yogicon kii vileyata ek duusare se bhinn hoti he
 For this reason, in analytical chemistry, these oximes are of great importance
 salicil aldoxim anek dhaatuon se is prakaar ke yogic banaata he, parantu tambe ke saath bane yogic ko chhodkar anya dhaatuon se bane sabhi yogic tanu aseetic amla main viley hai
 The compound made with copper is a powder of greenish-yellow color and it is heated to 110 ° C
 Can be dried and kept permanent
 at: iffrhem ne is oxim kaa anya tatwon se taanbe ke pruthakkaran tathaa uske parimaapan ke liye upyog karnaa acha batalaaya he
 Similarly, dimethyl glyxime, which is the dioxim of diketone-di-acetyl, forms narrow compounds with many metals, of which only compounds made of nickel and palladium are insoluble in dilute acids and dilute alkali solutions
 at: nikal tathaa paladium ke parimaapan tathaa nikal ko cobalt se purnat: pruthak karne main is oxim kaa bahut upyog hota he
 An oxime of beta naphthoquinone forms a similar insoluble compound with cobalt, which is used in the measurement of cobalt
 vinyas rasayan ke vikaas main oxymon kaa mahatv kuch kam nahin he
 In 1883, Hans Goldsmith discovered that the bi-oxime of benzyl was found in two forms, then in 1889, Victor Mayer also made a third form
 usee varsh becoman ne bataaya ki benzeldyhide kaa bhi do roopon main paaya jaataa he
 By applying Hant to compounds having> c = CC = N-, it was shown that the affixes of the axes are geometric isomers
 unke anusaar aldihidon tathaa asamamit kitonon ke oxim do roopon main paae jaayenge jinhen is prakaar likh sakate hai : This isomerism is similar to that of malic acid and fumeric acid at> c = c <
 kitonon main yah keval asamamit kitonon main sambhav he, kyonki R1 tathaa R2 ke ek ho jane se phir in do roopon main koi antar nahin rah jaataa
 On the basis of this, the forms of benzyl bi-oxim can also be written
 kitonon ke oxymon kii phosforus pentaxide ke saath ether main pratikriya karne se jo padaarth miltaa he us par jal kii pratikriya se pratisthapit acid-amide praapt hote hai
 This action is called Beckmann reconfiguration
 is kriya main mulkon kaa parivartan hota he
 The element which was previously combined with carbon, now transfers from the element oriented with nitrogen
 in padaarthon kaa is prakaar becoman roopantaran ke falswaroop bananaa is baat kii pushti karata he ki samaavyavi oxymon kii rachana to ek si he, parantu uski samavyawata mulkon ke tal main vibhinn prakaar se sthit hone ke kaaran hoti he
 After this to confirm these things Hans, Berner, W

 Mills, Maisenheimer, TWJ
 Taylor and L

 Chemists like Sutton etc
 have expressed their views from time to time on the basis of many experiments, but many things have not yet been decided in relation to the axes

 It was started in 1994
 abhi tak ise praapt karanevaale pramukh hindi vidwaan is prakaar hai- For the purpose of dance etc
, the design of the order and form of operation of different parts of the body is called choreography or choreography
 jo vyakti, nartak yaa kalakaar is kaary ko karata he, use 'nrityrachanaakaar' yaa nritysanyojak' yaa 'koreographer' kehete hai
 The history of dance is as ancient as the history of human life
 maanav jivan kii dainandin kriyakalapon main khushi ke avasaron ne lok nrityon ko janm diya
 These folk dances were always performed in groups
 in nrityon ke pad sanchaalan atyadhik saral hua karte the
 In most of the dances, people danced to form a circular circle, expressing their emotions with limited limb movements
 yah nrity itane sahaj va saral the ki koi dekhne vaala bhi inke saath lay taal main jhuumate hue nrity main shaamil ho jaataa tha
 This is to say that the structure of such dances was very simple
 bhartiya shastreey nrityon kii baat karen to kathak, odisi or bharatnatyam ko chhodkar anya sabhi nrity apane praarambhik swaroop main 'nritynaty' kii shrenee main aate the
 The performance of the group would have been performed by them as a dance drama, however the skill of group structure was not so much emphasized at that time
 purvi deshon kii bhanti pashchim ke deshon main bhi unke nrity kii ek samrudh parampara hamen praapt hoti he
 The art of 'choreography' is widespread in Western countries
 samooh rachana kii kala hamaare nrityon main bhi rahi he or madhyayugin granthon main 'samooh bandh' ke rup main hamen iske bare main jaankaree praapt hoti he
 The 'pindi Bandh' that Acharya Bharata also mentions in his Natyashastra - is related to the structure of the group itself
 bhartiya shastreey nrity main nartan ke tino bhedo nritt, naatay va nrity ke darshan alag-alag rup se bhalee-bhanti kiye ja sakate he
 The dance is composed of theater and dance and the development of this dance can be seen only in Indian dances
 haath va pairon ke lay va talbaddh sanchaalan ke saath jab geet ke shabdon ke anukool bhaavon kaa mail hota he tab vah nrity hota he or yah nrity darshakon ko pashchimi deshon ke nritt kii bhanti keval chamatkrit na hi karata he apitu unki aatma ko bhi sparsh karata he
 That is why ever since Indian dances have imbibed the art of choreography, a new attraction has arisen in them
 bhartiya nrityon main vishaygat vaividhyataa to he hi veshbhusha main bhi vividh rango kii chata he
 Therefore, the skill of group structure increases their influence manifold
 koreography se ek saral si nrity rachana ko bhi aakarshak banaaya ja saktaa he
 When performing a dance composition, the choreographer can combine a group of trained dancers in myriad ways to create unlimited shapes
 kathak nrity kii parampara main ye akritiyaan 'vyuh rachana' ke naam se jaani jaati he
 In solo dance performances these arrayed compositions could be presented through movements
 samooh main in rachanaaon kaa saundarya dwiguneet ho jaataa he
 Some of the figures presented in the group are as follows
 aaj ke electranik yug main darshako kii badalati ruchi ke saath saamanjasy banaae rakhane ke prayaas ne koreography ko or bhi adhik vistaar diya he
 If a group of 6 or 8 dancers display a single dance composition in place of a single dancer, then the variety, variety, and combination of dancers in many different sizes will definitely attract the audience
 bade samooh ko do yaa teen chote samoohon main baantkar kabhi ek sidhi lambii saral rekha to kabhi tirchhi rekha main nartako ko sanyojit kar kabhi ek bada gheraa banaakar uske andar chota gheraa banaakar, kabhi kuch nartako ko sthir tathaa kuch ko gatiman rakhkar, kabhi ek si gati or lay main ek jaise ang sanchaalan rakhkar vibhinn prakaar ke anginat sundar va aakarshak drishy bandho kii yojana kii ja sakati he
 Today the appearance of the stage has also changed completely
 aadhunik takanic se susajjit bade-bade aditorium, vividhta liye hue prakaash yojana, behtareen dhwani vyavastha aadi ne nrity pradarshan kii takanic ko bhi badal diya he
 This change is also inevitable
 vishaal manch par ek akelaa nartak utana prabhaav nahin paidaa kar paata he jitna ki nartakon kaa samooh karegaa
 The rise and fall of several hands at once, the use of illusions, the corresponding costumes and the corresponding light and sound combination is able to take the audience to the state of hypnosis
 koreographer yaa nrity sanyojak chaahe ekal nrity ho yaa samooh, nrity ke itihaas kaa sabase mahatvapurn vyakti he jo nartako ke padaghato va unki angik kriyaaon main saamanjasy dhundta he
 The plot expands the dance technique by combining the costumes of the dancers, the available stage instruments and the dancers in different situations and forms
 ek achche koreographer main nritykala vishay par acchhee pakad hone ke saath-saath usamen saundarya bodh kaa hona atyant aavashyak he
 Dance is visual, so it can be used in costumes, looks, and every instrument of stage effect
 ek kushal koreographer apni rachanaatmak pratibha se in sabhi kaa uchit prayog va pradarshan kar nrity rachana main chamatkaari prabhaav utpann kar saktaa he
 The art of choreography has also expanded in this era of change
 kam samay main adhik kah dena badi sankhya main nartako ko manch uplabdh karwaanaa, manch ke bade aakaar ko bade nartak samooh ke saath samanjit karnaa, tathaa vividhta banaae rakhte hue darshako kaa manoranjan karnaa, nishchit hi ek chunauteepurn kaary he
 Today the changing stage techniques, costumes, sound-lighting scheme, sets etc
 have provided an open sky for choreography to the choreographer, where he can give his imagination the desired flight

 aapke mukhya granth hai - 'maanav pragna kii ek pariksha' or 'naitik siddhanton kii ek pariksha' Hume's philosophy is exquisite in the background of experience
 aapke anusaar yah anubhav or ekmaatr anubhav hi he jo vaastavik he
 Any knowledge other than experience is not paramount
 buddhi se kisi bhi gyaan kaa aavirbhaav nahin hota
 With the help of intellect, man mixes and dissects the subjects gained from experience
 is buddhi se nae gyaan kii vruddhi nahin hoti
 There are relationships in the metaphors, which are of three types - analogy, contiguity and causality
 samanta ke aadhaar par ek vastu se duusari kaa samaran hona, nikatataa ke kaaran ghode se ghudsavaar kii yaad aana or surya ko prakaash kaa kaaran samajhnaa, in vibhinn sambandhon ke udhaaharan hai
 The causality relation attracted the attention of philosophers in the above three relations
 'kaaranta' ke sambandh main hum kaa vichaar he ki 'kaaranta' kaa aarope karnaa vyarth he
 The relation of cause and action is not real
 bahya jagat main ham do ghatnaon ko saath ghatate dekhte hai
 On the basis of the feeling of this always happening, we understand one as work and the other as reason
 surya ke chamakane se prakaash kii sadaiv prapti he, avashya; parantu isse ek ko kaaran or duusare ko kaary kaise kaha ja saktaa he? vastav main donon ke madhya kisi bhi 'kaaran sambandh' kaa anubhav nahin hota
 That is why according to Hume, work is completely different from reason and it is foolish to consider one embodied in another
 'prakruti samarupata' or 'kaaranta' kaa udbhav manovaigyanik prishthbhumi se hota he
 In other words, they say that their sentiment is predominant, not subjective
 'kaaranta' ke sadrush hi dravya main aasthaa rakhana bhrampurna he
 There is nothing other than various qualities in any object
 'ye gun kisi 'aashray' main hai,' aisa samajhnaa uchit nahin
 Knowledge of this type of 'shelter' is beyond experience
 kisi vastu se ek ek kar yadi anyaanya gunon ko hataaya jaae to ant main shoonyata hi shesh rahati he
 Hence the existence of matter is only a legend
 is prakaar hum ke vichaar main 'kaaranta' ke samaan hi dravya main vishwaas kaa hetu aatmagat abhyaas he, jise bhramavash vishaygat banaaya jaataa he
 Like physical matter, Hume does not even consider mental matter
 unke anusaar aatma yaa man anubhavon ke ekikaran ke alaava or kuch nahin he
 The mind is only a theater where mental systems like expressions, thoughts, experiences etc
 are seen dancing; But that mind also remains beyond automatic experience
 in maansik vichaaron kaa 'aashray' man yaa aatma he, isaki pushti anubhav se katai nahin hoti
 In relation to religion, Hume holds that its origin is not from the spiritual background of man but from the physical environment
 iskaa aadhaar samvednaa he, bhaavana nahin
 Human nature is the originator of religion, but that nature is not based on intelligence, nurtured by experience
 is swabhaav kaa sanchaalan maansik chintan se nahin hota, bhay or shaareerik sukh se niyantrit hota he
 It is this hope and eagerness that instills faith in the invisible power and it gives rise to the desire to be in the future
 dharm kii dharna ke samaan hi hum ne anubhavagochar ishwar kaa bhi khandan kiya
 The curiosity of their cause is natural by looking at the natural objects
 parantu sansar ko kaary maanakar uskaa kaaran ishwar ko maan lenaa anubhav ke pare he
 In fact, the sense of reasoning and faith in God is not natural
 nishchay hi jo anubhav se pare he use na ham jaan sakate hai or na siddh hi kar sakate hai
 It is true that Hume did not disbelieve in the existence of God, but he kept saying till the end that his knowledge is not possible
 is prakaar hum ne darshan ke kshetra main apane ko samichin sanshaywaadee siddh kiya

 abhikalan kaa siddhant yaa computer siddhant, computer vigyaan or ganit kii ek shakha he jo yah dekhati he kii kya or kitni kushalta se elgorithm kaa upyog karte hue abhikalan ke model par ek samasya ko hal kiya ja saktaa he
 The field is divided into two major branches: computational theory and complexity theory, but both branches discuss formal models of computation
 abhikalan kaa ek gahan adhyayan karne ke liye, computer vaigyanik, computer ke ek ganitiya sargrahan ke saath kaam karte hai jise abhikalan kaa model kaha jaataa he
 Several models are in use, but the most commonly investigated is the Turing machine
 a Turing machine can be interpreted as a desktop PC with potentially an infinite memory capacity, although it can only use this memory in small discrete amounts
 computer vaigyanik, turing mashin kaa adhyayan karte hai kyonki ise sutarabaddh karnaa aasaan he, vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he or parinaamon ko sabit karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he or kyonki yah aise model kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jise kai log abhikalan kaa sabase shaktishaalee sambhav "uchit" model maanate hai
 It may seem that capable infinite memory capacity is an inaccessible feature, but any deterministic problem solved by a Turing machine always requires only a finite amount of memory
 isliye siddhant rup main, koi bhi samasya jise ek turing mashin dwaara hal kiya ja saktaa he use ek aise computer dwaara hal kiya ja saktaa he jisamen smriti kii ek nishchit raashi he
 The principle of computation can be understood as the construction of all types of models in the field of computer science
 isliye ganit or tark kaa istemaal kiya jaataa kiya jaataa he
 In the last century it became an independent academic subject and broke away from mathematics
 abhikalan siddhant ke kuch agraduton main rahe alonjo carch, alan turing, stephen clin, jon won newman, cloud shenan or nom chomski
 Computability theory mainly discusses the question of the extent to which a problem can be solved on a computer
 yah bayaan ki ek holting samasya ko ek turing mashin dwaara hal nahin kiya ja saktaa he, computebility siddhant main sabase mahatvapurn parinaamon main se ek he, chunki yah ek aisi thos samasya kaa udhaaharan he jise sutarabaddh karnaa aasaan or turing mashin ke upyog se hal karnaa asambhav he
 The majority of computability theory builds on the result of the holting problem
 computebility siddhant main ek or mahatvapurn kadam rice prameya he, jo kahata he ki aanshik kriyaaon ke sabhi nan-treevial gunon ke liye yah anirnit he ki ek turing mashin us gun ke saath ek aanshik kriya kaa pariklan karti he yaa nahin
 Computability theory is closely related to the branch of mathematical logic, called recursion theory, which removes the restriction under which only models of computation can be studied that are eligible for a Turing machine
 kai ganitagya or abhikalan sidghantkaar jo rikrshan siddhant kaa adhyayan karte hai, ve use computebility siddhant ke rup main ullekh karenge
 Complexity theory does not just look at whether a problem can be solved on a computer, but also looks at how efficiently this problem can be solved
 do pramukh pahaluon par vichaar kiya jaataa he: samay jatilta or spes jatilta, jiskaa kramshah arth he ki ek abhikalan ko sampadit karne main kitne charan lagate hai or us abhikalan ko sampadit karne main kitni smriti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In analyzing how much time and space a given algorithm needs, computer scientists express the time and space required to solve that problem as a function of the size of the input problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, sankhyaon kii ek lambii suchi main ek vishesh sankhya ko dhundhna, sankhya kii suchi ke lambe hone se kathin hota jaataa he
 If we say that the list has n { \ displaystyle n} number and if the list is not sorted or indexed in any way then we may have to look at each number to find the number we want
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki is samasya ko hal karne ke liye, computer ko kai charan sampadit karne kii zarurat hogi jo samasya ke aakaar main raikhik rup se badhata he
 To simplify this problem, computer scientists have adopted the Big o notation, which allows comparisons of functions in a way that ensures that some particular aspects of machine constructs do not need to be considered
 , But only to observe asymptotic behavior when problems become larger
 to hamaare pichley udhaaharan main, ham kah sakate hai ki is samasya ko hal karne ke liye o { \ displaystyle O} charnon kii aavashyaktaa he
 Perhaps the most important open-ended problem in all of computer science is the question of whether a certain broad class of np-marked problems can be solved efficiently
 is par aage chalakar jatilta varg p or NP main charchaa kii gai he
 Apart from the Turing machine, other equivalent computation models are used
 saamaanya abhikalan model ke alaava, kuch saral abhikalan model vishesh, simit anuprayogon ke liye upyogi hote hai
 Regular expressions, for example, specify string patterns in many contexts, from office productivity software to programming languages
 ek or formalism jo ganitiya rup se regular expressant ke samakaksh he, parimit autometa he jiskaa prayog circuit dizine main or samasya sulajhane ke kuch prakaaron main kiya jaataa he
 Context-free grammar specifies the syntax of the programming language
 gaiyr niyatatmak pushdown autometa, sandarbh-mukt vyakaranon ke samakaksh ek anya formalism hai
 Primitive recursive verbs are a defined subclass of recursive verbs
 abhikalan ke vibhinn modelon main bhinn kaary karne kii kshamta hoti he
 One way to measure the power of a computation model is to study the class of formal languages that the model can generate; The Chomsky hierarchy of languages is derived in this way
 abhikalan siddhant kaa gathan karne vaale tatwon kii vyapak jaanch main aupchaarik shabdaarth vigyaan or ganitiya tark shaamil ho saktaa he or isamen kuch vishyon ke saidhantik pahalu bhi shaamil ho sakate hai jaise samanaantar pariklan, neural network or kwantum abhikalan

 bluez ke prakat hone ke saamaajik yaa aarthik kaaran puri tarah gyaat nahin hai
 The first appearance of the blues is often associated with the Emancipation Act of 1863, between 1870 and 1900, a period that coincides with liberation and, later, the development of juke bases as a place where black people live all day long Let's listen to music, dance, or gamble after hard work

 Many scholars see the development of blues music in the early 1900s as a shift from collective performances to a more personal style
 unka tark he ki bluez kii pragati ghulaam logon kii nai adhigrahit swatantraaa ke saath judi hui he
 According to Lawrence Levine, "there was a direct relationship between national ideological emphasis on the individual, the influence of the teachings of Booker T
 Washington and the origin of the blues
" " levin kaa kathan he ki "manovaigyanik, saamaajik or aarthik rup se, africa-americanyon kaa parasamskruthikaran kiya ja rahaa tha jo ghulaami ke dauraan naammumkin tha or yah shaayad hi aashcharya kii baat he ki unke dharmik sangeet jitna hi, dharmanirpeksh sangeet main yah parilakshith hota tha
 " sabhi bluez sangeet main kuch aam visheshtaayen maujuud hai, kyonki style ne vyaktigat pradarshan kii visheshtaon se aakaar grahan kiya
 However, some such features existed long before the creation of modern blues

 style that was associated with the accompaniment or melody and the formality of a particular musical structure
 " is purv-bluez kaa swaroop ghulaamon ke akhaadon kii chikhen or kheton ke samuhik gaan main suni ja sakati he jo "bhaavnaatmak saamagree se yukt saral ekal gaanon" main vistrut hua
 Blues evolved from a wide variety of genres and subgenres, including regional diversity, across the United States, from oral music and oral traditions to unaccompanied slaves from West Africa and rural blacks
 haalanki bluez ko, jis tarah ab prachlit he, donon europea susangat sanrachana or africa kol-and-respons parampara par aadhaarit sangeet style, jo swar or guitar ke anyonya kriya main parivartan ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, bluez kaa swaroop khud pashchim africa griot madhur shaileyon or kamazor tathaa saraheen prabhaavon se kisi tarah mail nahin khaataa
 vishesh rup se, kisi vishesh africa sangeet swaroop ko bluez ke ekmaatr pratyaksh mul ke rup main pahachaanaa nahin ja saktaa he
 However, many blues elements, such as the use of call-and-response formats and blue notes, can be linked back to African music
 blue nots ke bluez main upyog ke pehle ghatit hone or uske africa mul ko angrez sangeetkaar samual cholorij-tailor kii 1898 kii sangeet rachana da african suut for piano se "e nigro lav song" dwaara satyapit kiya gaya, jisamen blue third or seventh nots shaamil hai
 Diddley Bo and Banjo are African-derived instrumentalists who may have helped to distinguish African performance techniques in early blues instrumental-music terminology
 banjo sidhe pashchim africa sangeet se aayathit prathit hota he
 It is similar to the musical instrument that the griots play
 tathaapi, 1920 dashak main, jab country bluez ko record kiya jane laga tha, bluez sangeet main banjo kaa upyog nunatam tha or papa charlie jaikson or baad main gus canan jaise vyaktiyon tak hi simit tha
 Blues music has also adopted elements from "ethiopian rhythms", minstrel performances and spiritual songs of the Habshi, including instrumental and harmonic accompaniment

 Music forms and genres that are now considered "blues" as well as "country music" originated in the southern United States from similar areas during the nineteenth century
 Recorded blues and country have been available since the 1920s, when the popular record industry developed and produced a marketing class called "race Music" and "hillbilly Music" for the sale of music by blacks to whites and whites to blacks respectively

 us samay, pradarshan karne vaale kalakaar kii jaateeyata ke alaava, "bluez" or "country" ke bich koi spasht sangeet vibhaajan nahin tha, yahaan tak ki kabhi-kabhi record company dwaara jaateeyata bhi galat pralekhith hote the
 Although musicologists now define "blues" finely based on some of the cord structures and lyrical skills considered to have originated in West Africa, listeners originally listened to music in a more general way: it was simply the music of rural South Was particularly of the Mississippi Delta
 Black and white musicians shared the same repertoire and considered themselves "singers" rather than "blues musicians"
 The notion of blues as a distinct genre emerged during the 1920s migration of blacks from rural areas to urban areas as well as the development of the recording industry
 "blues" became a code word for records intended for sale to black listeners
 bluez ke mul kaa africa-america aadhyatmik samudaay ke dharmik sangeet se nazadiiki rishta he
 The origins of the spirituals, far behind the blues, generally go back to the mid-18th century, when slaves were Christians and began to sing and play Christian hymns, especially of Isa Watts, who was very popular
 bluez dwaara cord swarkram ke maamle main apni aupchaarik paribhaasha hasil karne se purv, use aadhyatmiko ke dharmanirpeksh samakaksh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya tha
 It was the following music played by rural blacks
 sangeetkaar jis dharmik samudaay se judaa tha uske aadhaar par, is nimna sangeet ko bajaanaa kamobesh paap mana jaataa tha: bluez shaitan kaa sangeet tha
 Musicians are therefore divided into two categories: gospel and blues singers, guitar preachers and singers
 However, when recording of black music began in the 1920s, musicians in both classes used similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue notes, and slide guitars
 Gospel music was nonetheless using musical formats consistent with Christian hymns and was therefore less marked by the blues than its secular counterpart
