 In many languages it is also known as Röntgen radiation, which is based on the name of its investigator Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen
 rontjan equalent maanav isaki shastreey maapak ikai he
 In 1895 X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Konrad Runtzen, a professor of physics at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany
 yadi kaanch kii nalika main se vaayu ko pump se kramash: nikaala jaae or usamen ucch vibhav kaa vidyudvisarjan kiya jaae, to daab ke paryaapt alp hone par vaayu swayan prakashit hone lagati he
 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray
 apaardarshee thos padaartho main se paar hone kaa eksre kaa gundharm atyant mahatvapurn tha or is gundharm kaa upyog vigyaan ke anek vibhaagon main ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, efforts were made to produce X-rays and study their properties in many physics laboratories
 alp daab par vaayu main jo vidyut visarjan hota he, uske adhyayan kaa aadhunik bhautikee ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan he
 If by connecting a long glass tube with a vacuum pump, the inner air flows through a high voltage current, initially, when the pressure is high, no action is seen, but when the air pressure is reduced first Both are electronegative
 daab ko or kam karne par sampurna nalika dhyutimaan ho jaati he
 According to the interpretation of modern physics, the reason is that when electrons get energy and they move with the remaining air molecules while moving at high velocity towards the positive
 sanghaton ke kaaran anuon ke aayan banate hai or jab ye aayan purv avasthaa ko praapt hote hai tab prakaash kaa utsarjan hota he
 Due to the existence of ions, electrophoresis continues in the air
 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it
 eksre kaa tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghy se bahut kam hone ke kaaran jin prayogon dwaara prakaash kaa tarangadairghy saralata se mapa ja saktaa he, vaise prayog eksre ke liye karne main anek kathinaaiyaan upasthit hoti hai
 However, in the present times, experiments like X-ray interference, diffraction, polarization, etc
 have been successful, and the wavelengths of the X-rays have been known to be as high as the optical waves
 jin prayogon se eksre kii tarangaprakruti pramanit hoti he unamem se kuch neeche die ja rahe hai- X-rays are particularly helpful in finding the crystalline structure
 chikitsiya upyogon ke alaava bhi eksre kaa anekon prakaar se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the unique properties of X-rays, they are widely used in many branches of science and in various industries
 udyogon main, visheshat: nirmaan tathaa nirmit padaartho ke gunon ke niyantran main, eksre kaa bahut upyog hota he

 Extremely high-voltage X-rays are required for large-sized metallic materials
 dhaatu vigyaan tathaa dhatugaveshna main eksre atyant upyogi hai
 Metals are also crystalline, but their crystals are fine and they are set up in the desired way, so the lave-statue of metals usually has a concentric circle
 prayek vartual ek samaan tivrata kaa hota he, kintu kisi bhautik kriya se kanon ke aakaaron main vruddhi ho jane par in vartualon main bindu bhi aate hai
 Therefore, by X-ray interference, it is known exactly what the particles of metallic particles are and how their shape is like

 At the time of making metal materials, heat causes them to become insoluble
 dhaatu ko modane se bhi usamen antarvikruti ho jaati he
 Such distortions can be analyzed by X-ray

 Among other uses of X-rays, the X-ray microscope is notable
 eksre ke tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghyo se sookshm hote hai, at: eksre sookshmdarshi ko prakaash sookshmdarshi se adhik prabhaavshaalee hona chahie
 In 1948, Kirkpatrick's efforts to focus X-rays were partially successful

 iskaa dharmik mahatv bhi he
 While worshiping Shiva, the flowers of this plant are offered on the Shivling
 iske phool pile tathaa safed rang ke hote hai
 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically
 jaise newton ke pehle bhi gurutvkarshan kaa bal kaary karata tha kintu newton ne uganukool shabdaawalee dekar ise vishwa ko "gurutvkarshan ke niyam" ke ghoshit siddhanton se avgat karaayaa, jo newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita

 In a condenser microphone, also called a capacitor microphone or an electrostatic microphone, the diaphragm acts as a plate of capacitor and the vibration converts the spacing between these plates
 is prakaar nirmit transdusar se sraavya output praapt karne kii do vidhiyaan hai: dc-abhinath or radio aavriti yaa ucch aavriti sanghnitr microphone
 ek dc-abhinath microphone main, platen ek sthir aavesh ke saath abhinath hoti hai
 The voltage across the capacitor plates varies with the vibrations in the air according to the capacitance formula, where, q = charge measured in coulomb, c = capacitance measured in ferred and v = potential difference measured in volts
 Huh
 samanaantar-plate vaale kisi sandharitra ke liye platon kii dharita unke bich antar ke saath pratilom rup se anupatik hoti he
 The assembly of stationary and movable plates is called an "element" or capsule
 sandharitra par ek lagbhag sthir aavesh banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 As the capacitance changes, this charge on the capacitor also changes slightly, but it remains reasonably stable at the frequencies that can be heard
 capsule kii dharita or abhinath pratirohak kaa maan se dasiyon gigohm ) milakar ek filter kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo dhwani sanketon ke liye ucch-paar or abhinath voltage ke liye nimna-paar hota he

 saamanytah ve ek ucch-gunvattta vaala dhwani sanket utpann karte hai or ab ve prayogshaala or studio recording anuprayogon main ek lokapriy pasand ban gaye hai
 The mass that is required for moving relevant sound waves is very low, an inherent suitability of this technology, while in contrast other microphone types require more work for sound waves
 unamem urja ke strot kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo fantom urja jaise microphone output ke madhyam se yaa ek choti bydaree ke dwaara pradaan kii jaati he
 The energy capacitor plate is required for the installation of voltage and is also needed to provide power to the microphone electronics
 Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms, from which the received signals can be electrically coupled to provide a range of polar styles, such as cardioids, omnidirectional and eight-size in English
 It is also possible to easily change patterns with some microphones, such as the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179
 ek elactrate microphone sandharitra microphone kaa ek apekshaakrit nayaa prakaar he, jiskaa gerhard sesler or gym west ne 1962 main bel laboratorys main kiya
 The externally applied charge described under the condenser microphone above is replaced by a permanent charge in an electret material
 ek elactrate ek louh-vidyutiya padaarth hota he, jise sthai taur par vidyutiya rup se aaweshit yaa tarangit kiya jaataa he
 The name is made up of electrostatic and magnets; a static charge is added to an electret by aligning the stationary charges in the material, which is almost the same as if a magnet is formed by the grafting of a magnetic field into a piece of iron
 unke achche pradarshan or utpaadan kii saralata or iske parinamswaroop kam laagat, ke kaaran vartmaan samay main bananevaale microphonon main se adhikansh elactrate microphone hote hai; ek semiconductor utpaadak kaa vaarshik akalan ek billian ikaayiyon se adhik kaa he

 Microphones built for personal computers, sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a stereo 3
5 mm plug, in which the ring receives power through a resistor from a 5 v supply to the computer; Unfortunately, many incompatible kinetic microphones are also added to the 3
5 mm plug
 yadhyapi shor ke str ke sandarbh main bahut thode elactrate microphone sarvshereshth dc-dhruvikrut ikaayiyon se pratispardhaa karte hai, lekin aisa elactrate kii antarnihit seemaa ke kaaran nahin he
 Rather, due to the strict tolerances required in the internal dimensions, the technologies required for mass production do not present themselves with the infallibility required to produce high quality microphones
 These tolerances are the same for all condenser microphones, regardless of DC, RF or electret technology
 gatyaatmak microphone vidyut-chumbakeey pravartan ke madhyam se kaary karte hai
 They are hard, relatively cheap and resistant to humidity
 iske saath hi feedback se purv unki sambhavit rup se ucch-prapti unhen manch par prayog ke liye adarsh banaati he
 Moving-coil microphones also use the same kinetic principle as loudspeakers, but they do the opposite
 ek choti se gatiman pravartan coil, jise ek sthai chumbak ke chumbakeey kshetra main rakhi jaati he, ko madhyapat se joda jaataa he
 When the sound enters through the microphone's waterproof glass, the sound waves move the diaphragm
 jab madhyapat main kampan hota he, to coil chumbakeey kshetra main chali jaati he, jisase vidyut-chumbakeey pravartan ke madhyam se coil main ek badalati hui vidyut-dhara utpann hoti he
 a single kinetic curtain does not respond linearly to all sound frequencies
 For this reason, some microphones use multiple screens for different parts of the sound spectrum and then combine the resulting signals
 anek sanketon ko thik prakaar se sanyojit karnaa kathin hota he or aisa kar paane vaali rachanaaen bahut durlabh or mahangi hoti hai
 On the other hand, various other compositions typically focus on isolated parts of the sound spectrum

 riban microphone or gatiman kundalee vaale microphone is sandarbh main samaan hote hai ki ye donon hi chumbakeey pravartan ke dwaara dhwani utpann karte hai
 Basic ribbon microphones identify sound in a bidirectional pattern because the ribbon, which is open to the sound from both the front and back, responds to pressure gradient rather than the pressure of the sound
 haalanki saamne or peeche kii ore sthit samametiya pick-ap saamaanya sterio recording main ek samasya ho sakati he, lekin riban microphone ko kshitijaatmak rup se, udhaaharan ke liye kartaal ke upar, rakhane par ucch-kshetra asweekruti kaa prayog ek laabh ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, taaki pichhlaa labaadaa keval kartaal ke upar se aane vaali dhwani ko hi letaa he
 Lineated at size 8 or added Bloomlin, stereo recording is becoming popular and the size 8 response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application
 anya dishaatmak pattern riban ke ek bhaag ko ek dhvanik-jaal yaa vyarodh main sammilit karke utpann kiye jate hai, jisase dhwani ko keval ek bhaag main pahunchane kii anumati milti he
 Traditional RCA Type 77-DX microphones have externally adjusted various internal resistors, allowing the selection of various response styles from "size-8" to "unidirectional"

 Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a pre-amplifier and therefore require phantom power and the circuit of modern indirect ribbon microphones, ie those that do not have the pre-amplifier mentioned above, is typically characterized by phantom power
 Ribbons and converters are made to prevent damage
 saath hi, kuch nae riban bhi uplabdh hai, jo vaat-visphoton or fantom vidyut-shakti ke prati pratirodhi hote hai
 a carbon microphone, such as the Berliner and Edison microphones, uses a capsule or button that holds carbon particles between two metal plates

 Examples of the use of carbon microphones are also found in early telephone repeaters, which enabled long-distance communication on the telephone even before the era of vacuum tubes
 These repeaters functioned by mechanically pairing a magnetic telephone receiver with a carbon microphone: the faint signal received from the receiver was transferred to the microphone and the resulting powerful electrical signal carried forward to the bottom line

 Since a conventional speaker is constructed almost exactly like a dynamic microphone, speakers can function virtually as "backwards" microphones
 haalanki, iskaa parinaam kam gunvattta, simit aavriti pratikriya or kam samvedansheeltaa vaale microphone ke rup main miltaa he
 In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications that do not require high quality and sensitivity, such as intercoms, walkie-talkies, or video game voice chat devices, or when traditional microphones are sufficient Not available
 haalanki, is siddhant kaa kam se kam ek or vyaavhaarik anuprayog bhi he: ek drum-set main "kik" ke saamne rakhe ek madhyam-aakaar vaale vufar kaa prayog microphone ke rup main karnaa

 The Yamaha Subakic, a woofer used in front of the kick drum, is a product example of this type of instrument
 12-inch chunki ek a The inner elements of a microphone are the primary sources of differences in its directivity
 ek daab microphone vaayu or vaataavaran kii nishchit aantarik maatra ke bich ek madhyapat kaa prayog karata he or sabhi dishaao se aane vaale daab ke prati samaan rup se pratyuttar detaa he, atah ise sarvadishaatmak kaha jaataa he
 a pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides
 The difference in pressure on either side creates its directional features
 microphone kii bahari banaavat jaise anya tatv or hastkshep nalikaaon jaise bahya upkaran bhi microphone kii dishaatmak pratikriya ko parivartit kar sakate hai
 a pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to the sound coming from the front or back, but it is insensitive to sound coming from the side because the sound coming from the front or back at the same time
 There is no gradation between the two
 The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is similar to that of the size-8
 anya dhruviya pattern ek capsule ke nirmaan dwaara vyutpann kiye jate hai, jo in do prabhaavon ko vibhinn tareekon se sanyojit karti he
 For example, cardioid exhibits a partially closed rear end, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics
 : Omnidirectional sabakaaradod Cardioid superkaradod Hypercardioids 8 kaa dwi-dishaatmak yaa chitra Shotgun kisi microphone kii dishaatmakataa yaa dhruviya pattern yah suchit karata he ki vah apane kendriya aksh ke aas-paas vibhinn konon par aane vaali dhwani ke prati kitna samvedansheel he
 The polar pattern displayed above represents the point-path of the points that produce the same signal level output in the microphone when a fixed sound pressure level is created from that point
 microphone kaa bhautik-dhaancha chitron ke saapeksh kis prakaar sthit hoga, yah microphone kii rachana par nirbhar hota he
 For large-screen microphones, such as the Octava, the upward direction in the polar image is usually perpendicular to the structure of the microphone, often referred to as "side fire" or "side address"
 chote microphonon, jaise shure, ke liye yah saamanytah microphone ke aksh se vistaarit hoti he, jise aksar "and fire" yaa "top / and adress" kehete hai
 Some microphone designs combine different principles to produce the desired polar pattern
 yah swayan dhaanche ke dwaara rakshan se lekar dohare pardon ko electronic rup se sanyojit karne tak ho saktaa he
 The response of an omnidirectional microphone is generally considered to be located in an exact circle in three dimensions
 vaastavik vishwa main, yah satya nahin he
 Like directional microphones, the polar pattern is a function of frequency for any "omnidirectional" microphone
 microphone kaa dhaancha aseemit rup se chota nahin hota or iske parinamswaroop, jab dhwani peeche se aa rahi ho, to yah swayan hi apane maarg ke bich aa jaataa he, jisase dhruviya pratikriya main kuch failaav aa jaataa he
 When the diameter of the microphone reaches the wavelength of the considered frequency, this dispersion increases
 atah sabase chote vyas vaala microphone ucch aavritiyon par sarvshereshth sarvadishaatmak visheshtaayen pradaan karata he
 At 10 khz the wavelength of sound is a little over an inch, so microphones with the smallest size are often 1 / 4 "in diameter, practically removing directionality even at the highest frequencies
 karadiods ke vipareet, sarvadishaatmak microphone, vilambon ke rup main gunjyman chhidron kaa prayog nahin karte, atah nimna ranjan ke sandarbh main unhen "sabase shuddh" microphone mana ja saktaa he; ve mul dhwani main bahut thodaa shor milaate hai
 Being pressure-sensitive, they can also have very flat low-frequency responses of up to 20 Hz or below
 dishaatmak microphonon kii tulana main daab-samvedi microphone hawa se hone vaale shor ke prati bahut kam pratikriya dete hai
 An example of a non-directional microphone is the circular at ball
 ek ekadishaatmak microphone keval ek disha se aane vaali dhwani ke prati samvedansheel hota he
 The diagram shown above shows several of these patterns
 prayek chitra main microphone kaa munh upar kii ore he
 The intensity of sound for a particular frequency is drawn as a radius for angles from 0 to 360 °
 sabase aam ekadishaatmak microphone karadod microphone he, jiskaa yah naam isaliye padaa he kyonki iskaa samvednaa pattern dil ke aakaar kaa hota he
 a hyper-cardioid microphone is similar to this, but has a more narrow area of frontal sensitivity and a smaller side of lateral sensitivity
 ek super-karadod microphone bhi hyper-karadod ke samaan hi hota he, antar keval itnaa he ki isamen saamne kaa pick-ap adhik or pichhlaa pick-ap kam hota he
 These three types are commonly used as microphones used for speech or speech because they are very well able to ignore sounds coming from other directions
 ek karadod microphone kisi sarvadishaatmak or aakaar-8 microphone kaa ek prabhavi ucchrup hota he; peeche se aane vaali dhwani tarangon ke liye, aakaar-8 kaa rinatmak sanket sarvadishaatmak tatv ke dhanatmak sanket ko nirast kar detaa he, jabaki saamne kii ore se aa rahi dhwani tarangon ke liye, ye donon ek duusare main jud jate hai
 a hypercardioid microphone is also similar, but its contribution is somewhat larger than the size-8
 chunki daab pravanta transdusar microphone dishaatmak hote hai, atah unhen dhwani strot ke bahut nikat rakhane kaa parinaam mandra-swar main vruddhi ke rup main miltaa he
 This is called the proximity effect
 "aakaar-8" yaa dwi-dishaatmak microphone kisi tatv ke saamne or peeche, donon ore se dhwani praapt karte hai
 Most ribbon microphones are of this type
 shotgan microphone sarvaadhik ucch rup se dishaatmak hote hai
 They have small areas of sensitivity to the left, right and back, but they are symptomatically less sensitive to the side and back than directional microphones
 yah tatv ko nalika ken antim chor par rakhane or bagal se kaate jane vaale khaanchon ke kaaran hota he; tarang nirastikaran aksh ke dur se aane vaali adhikansh dhwani ko hataa detaa he
 Shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in playgrounds and for field recording of wildlife, due to their sensitivity to field narrowing

 If the microphone is placed within, or very close to, any of these limits, these reflections coming from that surface are not recognized by the microphone
 Initially, this was done by placing a common microphone along the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam
 dhwani abhiyantaaon aid long tathaa ron vikersham ne madhyapat ko seemaa ke samanaantar uski ore munh karke rakhane kii sankalpana viksit kii

 Although a boundary microphone was initially implemented with the help of an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to gain some advantages of this technique by keeping a directional microphone close enough to the surface while retaining the directional characteristics of that element
 is vidhi ke liye crown kaa trademark "phase koharent karadod " yaa "PCC" he, lekin kuch anya nirmaataa bhi is takanic kaa prayog karte hai
 a lavalier microphone is made for hands-free operation
 ye chote microphone sharir par pahane jate hai
 Originally they were worn with a string around the neck to keep them in place, but they are often affixed to clothing with the help of a clip, pin, tape, or magnet
 lavelior dori ko kapadon ke dwaara chipaaya ja saktaa he or vah jeb main rakhe yaa kisi belt main fanse RF transmeter tak ho sakati he athwa sidhe hi mishrak tak ja sakati he
 a wireless microphone transmits sound as a radio or optical signal instead of being sent through a wire
 saamanytah yah ek chote FM radio transmeter kaa prayog karke dhwani tantra se jude nikatavarti resiver tak apane sanket bhejtaa he, lekin iskaa yadi transmeter or resiver ek duusare kii drushti-seemaa ke bheetar hon, to yah infrared prakaash kaa prayog bhi kar saktaa he
 Unlike sound vibrations transmitted through the air, a contact microphone directly vibrates from a solid surface or a substance
 bahut nimna-str kii dhvaniyon, jaise kisi chote padaarth yaa kisi keede se aane vaali dhwani, kii pahchaan karnaa iskaa ek upyog he
 Generally this microphone consists of a magnetic transducer, contact plate and contact pin
 sampark plate ko us padaarth ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he, jisase nikalne vaale compano ko grahan karnaa ho; sampark pin in compano ko transdusar kii kundalee kii ore sthanantarit karti he
 Contact microphones have been used to capture the sound of the snail's heartbeat and the ant's feet
 haal hi main, is microphone kaa ek suvahya sanskaran viksit kiya gaya he
 Another type of contact microphone is a gorge microphone, which receives speech directly from the gorge to which it is connected
 This allows the device to be used in areas with ambient sounds where it is not possible to hear the speaker otherwise
 ek paravalayik microphone dhwani tarangon ko microphone par ekatrit evam kendrit karne ke liye paravalayik paravartak kaa prayog karata he, jaisaa ki ek paravalayik antina dwaara radio tarangon ke saath kiya jaataa he
 Typical uses of this microphone, which has an unusually focused fore sensitivity and can capture sound from a distance of several meters, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, disguised listening, justice enforcement and even espionage

 a stereo microphone integrates two microphones into one unit, to produce a stereophonic signal
 a stereo microphone is often used for broadcast applications or field recording when it is impractical to format two separate condensers in the traditional XY configuration for stereophonic recording
 Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of vertical coverage between the two channels
 ek shor nirastikaran microphone ek atyadhik dishaatmak dizine hota he, jisaki rachana shorpurn vaataavaranon ke liye kii gai he
 One such experiment is in the cockpit of aircraft, where they are commonly installed on headset as boom microphones
 inkaa ek anya prayog ucch-swar vaale sangeet samaaroh ke manchon par gayakon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Many noise cancellation microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms located in opposite electromagnetism or electrically processed
 dohare madhyapat vaale dizine main, mukhya madhyapat abhisht strot se nikatatam duuri par santhaapit kiya jaataa he or duusare ko strot se bahut dur rakhaa jaataa he, taaki vah us vaataavaraniya dhwani ko grahan kar sake, jise mukhya madhyapat ke sanket se ghataana he
 When the two signals are combined, the sounds coming from sources other than the intended source are greatly reduced, making it better understood
 anya shor-nirastikaran dizine ek hi madhyapat kaa prayog karte hai, jo microphone kii bagal main or peeche khulne vaale port se prabhavit hota he, jinka yogafal dur se aane vaali dhvaniyon ke 16 db nirastikaran ke rup main miltaa he
 a noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used predominantly by vocal artists, such as Garth Brooks and Janet Jackson
 kuch shor-nirastikaran microphone kanth microphone hote hai
 The most common connectors used by microphones are: kuch microphone suvahya upkaran par sangyojan ke liye anya sanyojitron, jaise ek 5-pin XLR yaa mini XLR, kaa prayog karte hai
 Some lavalier ') microphones use a proprietary connector to connect to a wireless transmitter
 2005 se, USB sanyojanon se yukt vyavsaayik-gunvattta vaale microphonon kaa udai hona prarambh hua he, jinhen computer-aadhaarit software main pratyaksh recording ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Microphones have an electrical feature called impedance, measured in ohms and dependent on design
 vishishtatah, moolyankit pratibaadha bataai jaati he
 An impedance below 600 ω is considered a low impedance
 600 ω tathaa 10 kω ke bich madhya pratibaadha maani jaati he
 High impedance above 10 kω
 sanghnitr microphone ke naam par) main vishisht rup se 50 or 200 ohm ke bich kii output pratibaadha hoti he
 The output of a microphone provides the same power even when the impedance is low or high
 yadi ek microphone ko ucch or nimna pratibaadha vaale sanskarnon main banaaya gaya he, to kisi vishisht dhwani daab input ke liye ucch pratibaadha vaale sanskaran main ek ucchtar output voltage hota he or yah nirvaat-nalika guitar pravardhakon, udaahranarth, jinamein ek ucch input pratibaadha hoti he or jinamein nalika main antarnihit shor ko dabaane ke liye ek apekshaakrit ucch sanket input voltage kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ke saath prayog ke liye upyukt hota he
 Most commercial microphones have low impedance, around 200 ω or less
 vyavsaayik nirvaat-nalika dhwani upkarnon main ek transformar sammilit hota he, jo microphone paripath kii pratibaadha ko input nalika ke sanchaalan ke liye aavashyak ucch pratibaadha or voltage tak badhaata he
 External matching transformers are also available, which can be used in a straight line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input
 nimna pratibaadha vaale microphonon ko ucch pratibaadha vaale microphonon kii tulana main do kaarnon se praathamikta di jaati he: pehla yah he ki lambey taar vaale ek ucch-pratibaadha microphone kaa parinaam taar kii dharita ke kaaran ucch-aavriti sanket haani ke rup main miltaa he, jo microphone output pratibaadha ke saath ek nimna-paar filter kaa nirmaan karti he
 The second reason is that high-impedance long strings assume more buzzing) too)
 yadi microphone or anya upkaran ke bich pratibaadha kaa milan galat ho jaae, to koi haani nahin hoti; sabase bura parinaam sanket main kami yaa aavriti pratikriya main parivartan ke rup main miltaa he
 Most microphones are designed so that their impedance does not match with the load to which they are attached
 aisa karne se unki aavriti pratikriya parivartit ho sakati he, jisase virupan, visheshtah ucch dhwani daab staron par, utpann ho saktaa he
 Some ribbons and kinetic microphones are exceptions, as their designers believe that a typical load impedance is part of the microphone's internal electro-acoustic damping circuit
 audio ejineering socity dwaara prakashit AES 42 maanak microphonon ke liye ek digital interphes ko paribhaashit karata he
 Microphones adhering to this standard generate a digital audio stream directly through an XLR male connector, instead of producing an analog output
 digital microphonon kaa prayog AES 42 maanak kaa paalan karne vaale upyukt input sanyojanon se yukt nae upkarnon ke saath athwa ek upyukt interphes box ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he
 Studio quality microphones operating according to the AES 42 standard are now available from many microphone manufacturers
 microphonon kii rachana main antaron ke kaaran, unamem dhwani ke prati swayan kii vishisht pratikriyaayein hoti hai
 This difference in response produces uneven phase and frequency responses
 iske atirikt, microphone dhwani daab ke prati bhi samaan rup se samvedansheel nahin hote or virupan ke bina bhinn-bhinn str sweekaar kar sakate hai
 Although more similar microphones are desirable for scientific applications, this is often not the case for music recordings because the uneven response of the microphone can produce desirable pigmentation of sound
 microphone vinirdeshon kaa ek antarrashtriya maanak bhi he, lekin bahut kam nirmaataa hi uskaa paalan karte hai
 As a result, it is difficult to compare data published by different manufacturers because they use different measurement techniques
 microphone data website ne vartmaan main soochibaddh prayek microphone or yahaan tak ki kuch aprachlit modelon ke liye bhi microphone nirmaataaon se chitron, pratikriya vakron or takneekee data se paripurna takneekee vinirdesh ekatrit kiye hai or tulana main saralata ke uddeshy se un sabhi ke bare main data ek saamaanya praaroop main pradarshit kiya gaya he
 
 However, caution must be exercised when drawing a firm conclusion from this or any other published data, unless it is known that the manufacturer has provided these specifications in accordance with IEC 60268-4
 ek aavriti pratikriya aarekh microphone samvedansheeltaa ko aavritiyon kii ek shrenee main, saamanytah sateek rup se aksh-par sthit dhwani ke liye desibel main rakhata he
 The frequency response may be less informatively presented as text: "30 Hz-16 khz ± 3 db"
 This is interpreted as an almost flat, linear, plot between the described frequencies, with a modular difference in amplitude not exceeding 3 db
 haalanki, ham is soochna ke aadhaar par yah nirdhaarit nahin kar sakate ki ye antar kitne nirbaadh hai, na hi ye ki ve varnakram ke kis bhaag main ghatit hote hai
 Note that commonly made statements, such as "20 Hz – 20 khz", are meaningless without a decibel measurement of tolerance
 dishaatmak microphonon kii aavriti pratikriya dhwani strot se antar or dhwani strot kii jyamiti ke saath bahut adhik badalati jaati he
 According to IEC 60268-4 the frequency response should be measured in flat progressive wave conditions, but this is seldom practical
 band vaarta microphonon ko vibhinn dhwani sroton or duriyon ke saath mapa ja saktaa he, lekin iskaa koi maanak nahin he or isaliye yadi maapan takanic varnit na kii gai ho, to vibhinn modelon se praapt data kii tulana kar paane kaa koi tarika nahin he
 Self-noise or equivalent noise level is the level of sound that produces the same output voltage as that produced by the microphone in the absence of sound
 yah microphone kii gatij shrenee ke nimnatam bindu kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or vishisht rup se tab mahatvapurn hota he, jab aap shant dhvaniyon ko record karnaa chaahate hon
 yah maap aksar db main varnit kiya jaataa he, jo ki ek desibel maapan aavriti par shor kii samakaksh prabalata hoti he- jo ki iske liye bhaarit hoti he ki kaan kis prakaar sunate hai, udhaaharan ke liye: "15 dba SPL" 
 yah maan jitna kam ho, utana behatar he
 Some microphone manufacturers describe noise levels using ITU-R 468 noise loading, which more accurately describes how we hear sound, but provides an 11–14 db higher value 
 ek achal microphone vishishtatah 20 dba SPL yaa 32 db SPL 468-bhaaran ko maapta he
 Very quiet microphones have also been available for special applications for many years, such as Brull and Zaire 4179, which have a noise level around 0 db SPL
 haal hi main, nimna shor vinirdesh vaale kuch microphone studio / manoranjan bazaar main prastut kiye gayi hai, jaise newman or road ke model, jo apane vigyaapan main 5-7 dba ke bich shor staron kaa daawa karte hai
 Typically this is achieved by a change in the frequency response of the capsule and electronics, resulting in lower noise within the A-loading curve, while broadband noise can be increased
 microphone dwaara sweekaar kiya ja sakane vaala adhiktam SPL kul anukanpi virupan ke vishisht maanon, vishishtat: 0
5%, ke liye mapa jaataa he
 This amount of distortion is generally inaudible, so one can use the microphone on this SPL without damaging the recording
 udhaaharan: "142 db SPL ucch "
 yah maan jitna adhik ho, utana behatar hota he, haalanki bahut ucch SPL vaale microphonon main swa-shor bhi ucchtar hota he
 Probably the clipping level is a better indicator of the maximum usability level, since the 1% THD value generally stated under the maximum SPL is actually a much lighter level of distortion, which, especially at brief higher levels, is quite inaudible
 
 microphonon se anukanpi virupan saamanytah nimna-shrenee prakaar kaa hota he or atah, yahaan tak ki 3-5% par bhi, yah bahut adhik sraavya nahin hota
 duusari ore, kataran, jo ki madhyapat apni purna visthaapan seemaa tak pahunch jane par utpann hoti he, apane ucch-staron par ek karkash dhwani utpann karti he or jahaan tak sambhav ho, isse bachanaa chahie
 kuch microphonon ke liye kataran str adhiktam SPL se bahut adhik ho saktaa he
 The difference in SPL between the noise level and the maximum SPL is called the kinetic range of a microphone
 yadi swayan iske dwaara varnit kii jaae, udaahranarth "120 db", to yah swa-shor or adhiktam SPL aankadon ko swatantra rup se varnit kiye jane kii tulana main lakshaneey rup se kam jaankaree pradaan karti he
 Sensitivity refers to how well a microphone converts acoustic pressure to output voltage
 ek ucch samvedansheeltaa microphone adhik voltage nirmit karata he or isaliye isamen mishrak yaa recording upkaran par kam pravardhan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This is practically a concern but is not a direct indication of the quality of the mic and the term sensitivity is somewhat inappropriate, "re-transduction" is probably more meaningful because the net sensitivity is generally determined by the noise level and the output level
 Too much "sensitivity" in the context compromises the clipping level
 iske do aam maapan hai
 The international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1 khz
 ek ucch maan ucchtar samvedansheeltaa ko suchit karata he
 The old American method refers to a 1 v / Pa standard and is measured in flat decibels, resulting in a negative value
 punah ek ucchtar maan ucchtar samvedansheeltaa ko suchit karata he, atah -60 db kii samvedansheeltaa -70 db se adhik hoti he
 Some microphones are only intended to test speakers, measure noise levels, and otherwise result in an acoustic experience
 ve anshashodhit transdusar hote hai or inaki aapurti saamanytah ek anshshodhan praaanpatr ke saath kii jaati he, jo aavriti ke muqaabale inaki purna samvedansheeltaa ko varnit karte hai
 The quality of measurement microphones is often referred to by using designations such as "category 1", "type 2", etc
, which refer to sound level meters, not to microphone specifications
 maapan microphone pradarshan kaa varnan karne ke liye ek adhik vyapak maanak haal hi main apanaaya gaya tha
 Measurement microphones are usually scalar sensors of pressure; They exhibit an omnidirectional response, limited only by the scattered contours of their physical dimensions

 a pistonphone is an acoustic calibrator to produce a clear sound pressure for calibration of a microphone using a closed coupler
 yah siddhant yantrikeey rup se sanchalit piston ko ek vishisht chakree dar par, hawa ke ek nishchit aaytan ko dhakelne par ashrith hota he, jis par jaancha ja rahaa microphone ujagar kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that the air is compressed thermally and the sound pressure level in the chamber is calculated by the internal physical dimensions of the device and the stabilizing gas law, which requires that PV γ { \ displaystyle PV ^ { \ gamma}} be a constant
 Where p { \ displaystyle P} is the pressure in the p chamber, v { \ displaystyle V} is the volume in the v chamber and γ { \ displaystyle \ gamma} \ gamma is the volume of the air at constant pressure against its specific heat at constant volume There is heat, it can be done by

 yah pinjraa padaarthon yaa vaayu ke yantrikeey prabhaavon ke viruddh pratiraksha kii pehali pankti pradaan karata he
 Some microphones, such as the Shure SM58, may have an extra layer of foam from within this cage to further enhance the shield's protective features
 In addition to full microphone airtight glasses, there are broadly three categories of additional air defenses
 vayurodhi shishe kii ek kami yah he ki microphone kii ucch aavriti pratikriya kaa kuch maatra main kshinan ho jaataa he, jo ki rakshaatmak parat ke ghanatv par nirbhar hota he

 mahashivaratri se sambadhit kai puranic kathayen he: On the day of Mahashivaratri, Lord Shiva kept a poison named Kalkut in his throat
 jo samudr manthan ke samay baahar aayaa tha
 Once Parvati ji asked Lord Shiva Shankar, 'what is the best and simple fast-worship, from which the beings of the dead land get your grace easily?' In reply, Shivji told this story by telling Parvati to observe the fast of 'shivratri' - 'once there was a hunter named Chitrabhanu
 pashuon kii hatya karke vah apane kutumb ko paalataa tha
 He was indebted to a moneylender, but could not repay his loan on time
 krodhit sahuukaar ne shikari ko shivamath main bandi bana liya
 Coincidentally it was Shivratri that day
 ' The hunter meditated and kept listening to religious things related to Shiva
 chaturdashi ko usne shivaratri vrath kii katha bhi suni
 Just before dusk, the moneylender called him to him and talked about repaying the loan
 shikari agle din sara rin lautaa dene kaa vachan dekar bandhan se chhot gaya
 Like his daily routine he went out hunting in the forest
 lekin dinabhar bandi grih main rahane ke kaaran bhukh-pyaas se vyakul tha
 To hunt, he started making a halt on the vine tree on the banks of a pond
 bel vriksh ke neeche shivlinga tha jo vilvapatron se dhakaa hua tha
 Hunter could not find the person
 padaav banaate samay usne jo tahaniyaan todin, ve sanyog se shivlinga par giriin
 In this way, fasting and thirsty hunters were also fasted throughout the day and bell-sheets were also climbed on the Shivling
 ek pahar raatri biit jane par ek garbhini mrigi talab par pani pine pahunchi
 As soon as the hunter drew an arrow on the bow, the antelope said, 'I am pregnant
 sheeghra hi prasav karuungi
 You will kill two creatures simultaneously, which is not right
 main bachche ko janm dekar sheeghra hi tumhaare samaksh prastut ho jaaoongi, tab maar lenaa
 The hunter loosened the cross and the deer disappeared into the wild bushes
 kuch hi der baad ek or mrigi udhar se nikali
 The hunter was over the moon
 sameep aane par usne dhanush par baan chadhaaya
 Seeing him, the deer politely pleaded, 'O Pardhi! i retired from the season a while ago
 kamaatur virahinee hum
 i am wandering in search of my beloved main apane pati se milakar sheeghra hi tumhaare paas aa jaaoongi
 ' The hunter let him go as well
 do baar shikaar ko khokar uskaa maathaa thanka
 He was in all sort of thoughts
 raatri kaa aakhri pahar biit rahaa tha
 Then another antelope escaped with her children
 shikari ke liye yah svarnim avasar tha
 He did not take long to shoot arrows at the bow
 vah tir chhodane hi vaala tha ki mrigi boli, 'he pardhi!' main in bacchon ko inke pita ke hawaale karke laut aauungi
 Do not kill me this time
 shikari hansaa or bolaa, saamne aae shikaar ko chhod duun, main aisa murkh nahin
 i have lost my prey twice before
 mere bachche bhukh-pyaas se tadap rahe honge
 In response, the deer again said, as you are maltreating your children, just like me too
 isliye sirf bacchon ke naam par main thodi der ke liye jeevandaan maang rahi hum
 Hey Pardhi! Trust me, i promise to leave them to their father and return immediately
 mrigi kaa deen swar sunakar shikari ko us par dayaa aa gai
 He let that chicken escape too
 shikaar ke abhaav main bel-vrikshapar baitha shikari belptr tod-todakar neeche phenkata ja rahaa tha
 When the dawn broke, a strong deer came on the same path
 shikari ne soch liya ki iskaa shikaar vah avashya karegaa
 Seeing the trunk of the hunter, he said in a loud voice, o brother! If you have killed three antelopes and small children coming before me, do not delay in killing me, so that i do not have to suffer even a single moment in their disconnection
 main un mrigiyon kaa pati hum
 If you have given them life, please give me some life too
 main unase milakar tumhaare samaksh upasthit ho jaaoongaa
 As soon as he heard the deer, the whole night cycle happened in front of the hunter, he narrated the whole story to the deer
 tab mrug ne kaha, 'meri teenon patniyaan jis prakaar pratigyabaddh hokar gai hai, meri mrityu se apane dharm kaa paalan nahin kar paaengi
 So, just as you have left him as a confidant, let me also go
 main un sabake saath tumhaare saamne sheeghra hi upasthit hota hum
 'fasting, night-awakening and climbing the bell leaf on the Shivling, the violent heart of the hunter was purged
 usamen bhagavad shakti kaa vaas ho gaya tha
 The bow and arrow were easily left from his hand
 bhagwaan shiv kii anukanpa se uskaa hinsak hriday kaarunik bhaavon se bhar gaya
 He started burning in the flame of repentance remembering his past deeds
 thodi hi der baad vah mrug sapariwaar shikari ke samaksh upasthit ho gaya, taaki vah unka shikaar kar sake, kintu junglee pashuon kii aisi satyata, satviktaa evam samuhik prembhaavana dekhakar shikari ko badi glani hui
 There was a burst of tears from his eyes
 us mrug parivaar ko na markar shikari ne apane kathor hriday ko jeev hinsa se hataa sadaa ke liye komal evam dayaalu bana liya
 All the Dev Samaj from Devalok were also watching this event

 puraani metric pranali main kai ikaayiyon ke samooh prayog kiye jate the
 SI was developed in 1960 from the old meter-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimeter-gram-second system, which had many difficulties
 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units
 parantu iske apwaad sanyukt rajya america or britain hai, jahaan abhi bhi gaiyr-si ikaayiyon unki puraani pranaliyaan lagu hai
 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957
 iske saath hi yahaan nayaa paisa bhi lagu hua, jo ki swayan dashamalav pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Many new naming units came into force in this system

 prayek SI mul ikai kii paribhaasha saavdhaanee purvak banaai gai he taaki vah apurv or adwitiya ho or saath saath ek thos saidhantik aadhaar prastut kare jis par aadhaarit sabase parishuddh or punarutpaadaneey maapan kiye ja saken
 The process of implementing a definition of a unit is one in which that definition, like that unit, establishes the value of its quantity and the uncertainty associated with it; Can be used
 kuch mahatvapurn ikaayiyon kii paribhaashaayen kaise karyanvit kii jaati hai, yah BIPM kii websit par diya gaya haiek SI vyutpann ikai adwitiya rup keval SI mul ikaayiyon ke rup main hi paribhaashit hoti he
 For example, the SI derivative unit of electrical resistance, ohms, is uniquely defined by this relation: ω = m2 kg s − 3 a − 2, which is the result of the definition of the amount of electrical resistance
 vaise koi bhi tarika, jo ki bhautikee ke siddhanton / niyamon se saamanjasy rakhata ho, vah kisi bhi SI ikaayiyon ke karyanvayan hetu prayog ho saktaa he
