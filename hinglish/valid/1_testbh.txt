 is dardanaak story main police, kanoon or insaaf kaa ek aisa sach qaid he jisaki koi duusari misaal hindustan to kya puri duniya main nahin milegi
 This truth is something that even after hearing you will not believe your ears
 par aapako yakeen karnaa padegaa
 Because this is true
 1968naam- jagjivanumr- 28 salilzaam- bhabhi kaa qatlgel main kaate 37 saal37 saal baad
 
 
 2006 Name - Jagjivan Age 65 years Fasala - Supreme Court took cognizance of Jagjivan's case and released him from jail
 2014naam-jagjivanumr-73 salzindaa magar khamotiobas ek insaani galati ke chalate jindagi ke sabase khubasurat 37 saal jail kii salaakhon ne nigal liye
 After 37 years, the court rectified that mistake but by then it was too late
 umr ke saath-saath uski awaz bhi kareeb-kareeb khamosh ho chuki he
 Will that old age, all the happiness related to his age and his voice be able to return to him? Should not any court of the world have given such a ruthless punishment to any murderer for a murder
 37 saal kaid bamashkkat
 Yes, for the entire 37 years, he was imprisoned without hearing, without argument, without judgment
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki police or adaalat donon hi use jail bhejne ke baad puure 37 saal tak usapar mukadmaa chalaanaa hi bhul gaye
 Jagjivan kept staring at bus bars for the last 37 years
 in 37 saalon main salakhen to waisi hi raheen magar haa khud isaki zindagi ko jang lag gaya
 Just understand that these lifeless bars swallowed Jagjivan's entire life
 baahar kii duniya kisi hoti he? aaazaad hindustan kaa badalata cheharaa kya he? insaaniyat, mohabbat, rishtedaari, jajbaat kis chidiya kaa naam he ye isko pataa hi nahin
 Even if you know how? 37
 How can a person who has been caught for years know the meaning of freedom and free life? Jagjivan was in captivity because he was accused of a murder
 katl apni bhabhi kaa or ye katl hua tha 37 baras pehle
 In 1968
 faijabad ke khandasa ilaake main
 Just after this murder, Jagjivan's bad luck began
 shuruaati shaq ke aadhaar par katl ke fouran baad khandasa police ne jagjivan ko giraftaar kar liya or use jail bhej diya gaya
 But just a few years after going to jail, Jagjivan's mental condition started deteriorating, so the district court, in view of Jagjivan's mental condition, sent him to the mental hospital in Benares
 is adalati farmaan ke saath ki jail prashasan or jila police jagjivan kii dimagi haalat ke bare main har tisare maheene court ko apni report degi
 But even once in 37 years, this report did not reach the court
 lihaaja vakt bitne ke saath jail prashasan or police ke saath saath khud adaalat bhi jagjivan ko bhul gai
 The second aspect of Jagjivan's misfortune is more cruel than the first
 police or jail ke afasaron ne shuru se hi jagjivan ke gharavaalon ko uske bare main gumraah rakhaa
 Whenever Jagjivan's wife and son go to jail knowing his well-being, they are not allowed to meet him
 milane dete bhi kaise? jagjivan ko jail se varanasi paagalakhaane bhejne kii baat khud jail adhikari tak jo bhul chuke the
 So after a long wait, Jagjivan's family members had patience thinking that Jagjivan might not live in this world anymore
 udhar jagjivan ke ghar waalon ko jagjivan kaa suraag nahin mil rahaa tha or idhar jagjivan unhen paaglon kii tarah dhund rahaa tha
 He spent years writing letters to his family members from jail
 par wo khat kabhi uske ghar tak pahunchaa hi nahin
 There was such a joy of one such letter of Jagjivan
 
 
 'kishan kii maa sadaa khush raho
 
 
 We wrote many letters to you from here but did not reach you
 meraa kisi se batiyaane kaa man nahin karata
 That's why everybody considers us crazy here
 hamako in logon ne paagalakhaane main daal diya he
 i miss you a lot
 tum kisi ho
 How does the expenditure of the house go? hamaara betaa to ab jawan ho gaya hoga naa
 Will you earn? So many years have passed if you guys get time, then get rid of us here
 'bhala ho aspataal prashasan kaa
 
 
 a judge continued to serve the sentence without trial and the prison administration slept peacefully along with the police
 ye neend shaayad or bhi lambii hoti lekin bhala ho aspataal prashasan kaa jisane jagjivan kii dimagi haalat durust hone kii report jail adhikariyon ko di
 Adalat, who had forgotten his culprit for 37 years and was shocked when the police administration received Jagjivan's report
 maamla kanoon ke saath khilwaad kaa jo tha
 Yesterday every murderer makes every attempt to escape punishment after the murder, but Jagjivan was a unique murderer who remained behind bars without trial for 37 years and waited for his sentence
 jagjivan ke mukademe se jude tamaam kagajaat gayabreeport milane ke baad ghabaraai police filein khangaalane main jute gai
 The police had to find a 37-year-old record, but where could those who had forgotten Jagjivan improve their report? All the police stations that described Jagjivan as murderer were missing from the police files
 paralok sudhaar chuke the gavaahjagjivan ke mukademe se jude tamaam kagajaat naa to adaalat ke paas thi or naa hi police ke paas
 The court had only a list of witnesses
 wo fehrist jiske jariye ab mukademe kii sunwaayee aage badhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi thi
 But look amazing, according to Fehrist, among the witnesses who were to be called for testimony, all the hereafter except Ekka Dukka had improved
 khayr sachai saamne aane ke baad police or jail prashasan ne cese ke kagajaat dhundne shuru kiye
 But the case papers were not found, however, the police found a piece of paper which contained the name and address of Maktool
 
 
 
 When the story of Jagjivan was shown in Aaj Tak's popular program Jurm, on the strength of this single paper, the police and the jail administration decided to resume the prosecution of Jagjivan after 37 years
 is faisle kii bhanak 2006 main ajtak ko lagi
 After this, the story of Jagjivan was shown in Aaj Tak's popular program Jurm
 jagjivan kii ye tasviren usee vakt shoot kii gai thim
 Incidentally, this program was also seen by some people who knew Jagjivan
 tab unhen pehali baar pataa chalaa ki jagjivan mara nahin he balki ab bhi jinda he
 Jagjivan's family met Jagjivan for the first time after nearly 30 years after watching the news on Aaj Tak
 baad main ye khabar akhabaaron kii bhi surkhiyaan baniin
 But look at the fact that despite all the negligence of the police and the jail administration, Jagjivan was not released
 bhale hi tamaam kagajaat gaayab the, gavaah mar chuke the
 The truth of Jagjivan was revealed, yet the court refused to release him on bail
 daleel di gai ki wo katl kaa mulgim he or cese kaa faisla aana baaki he
 But after Jagjivan's truth was revealed, a debate started
 bahes ye ki agar maan bhi liya jaae ki jagjivan kaatil he or adaalat main uskaa jurm sabit bhi ho jaataa tab bhi shaayad use ek umr kaid se zyada sajaa nahin milti
 But for this one murder whose hearing had not even started, Jagjivan has already been sentenced to the equivalent of 3 life imprisonment
 kya ye insaaf he?ajtak kii pahal ke baad akhabaaron main bhi ab mudda garma chukaa tha
 Everyone was accepting the injustice done to Jagjivan
 par insaaf nahin ho rahaa tha
 Jagjivan's family was also circling the court for 37 years for surety
 sawaal ye tha ki jis jurm ke liye use shaayad zyada se zyada umr kaid yani 14 saal kii sazaa milti wo usase teen guna zyada sazaa to pehle hi kaat chukaa he
 Then where did justice happen to him? With this question, Jagjivan's lawyer reached the Supreme Court of the country's largest court
 desh kaa kanoon saaf kahata he ki har mujrim ko uske jurm ke liye tay sazaa hi milani chahie
 Not more or less than that
 lihaaza supreme court ne jagjivan or uske cese kii kahani sunne ke baad sirf isi binah par uski rihaai kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 And thus, after 37 years, Jagjivan became independent
 par kamaal dekhie ki jis ilzaam main wo 37 saal tak jail main band rahaa
 The trial for that murder was still not completed
 37 saal baad jab jagjivan jail se ghar lautaa
 
 
 When Jagjivan went to jail 37 years ago, his only son Keshav Ram was just one and a half years old
 37 saal baad jab jagjivan jail se ghar lautaa to keshav kareeb 40 saal kaa ho chukaa tha
 Not only was he married but he also has five children
 par jagjivan kaa bete ko bada hota dekh paaya or naa hi uski shaadi main shaamil ho sakaa
 However, it has been eight years since Jagjivan was freed from jail
 jab wo jail gaya tha tab 28 saal kaa tha
 When released, Jagajeevan is 65 years old and now 73 years old
 magar 37 saal ke us nasoor ne jagjivan ki dilon-dimag par aisa asar daalaa ki jail se baahar aate hi wo khamosh ho gaya
 His voice is almost lost
 ek taraf jail ke andar 37 saal tak jagjivan system kii galati kaa khamiyaaza bhugat rahaa tha, to duusari taraf jail ke baahar uskaa parivaar har guzarate din ke saath bikharata ja rahaa tha
 During this time, there was so much happiness and sorrow in the house
 par jagjivan ke hisse main sirf akelaapan or matam tha
 This is the reason why even after release, that loneliness of 37 long years has not been far from the life of Jagjivan
 jail kii charadivari ne naa sirf jagjivan kii yaaddaasht balki unke jajbaat tak ko khatm kar diya he

 Pratap Chauhan said that blood donation is Mahadan, it is considered equal to life donation

 The BJP leader said that while the whole world is praising the Prime Minister's recent foreign visit, the Congress is criticizing him and making baseless allegations to divert the attention of the people

 If i fight a quarter to a million, then i should be called Guru Gobind

 The news of Bihar's reforms had started coming, it was also due to the resolve of BJP ministers and mlas
 uske baavjood bhi
 Once the question came
 do do chunaav hue
 The topic was in front of the party
 gujarat se narendra modi ko chunaav prachaar main laayaa jaae
 The media had also raised a big topic
 hamaare bihar ke netaa, unka mujh par itnaa pyaar tha
 He was so eager to call me
 tab maine susheel ji ko, nandakishor ji ko kaha tha
 Do not insist on calling me
 hamaara makasad bas ek he ki bihar main jangalraj na hone do
 If Modi is insulted then let it happen
 narendra modi bihar ke baahar rahata he to rahane do
 Jungle raj should not come in Bihar
 hamaare liye dal se badhkar desh hota he
 That is why i did not come to Jungle Raj despite the wishes of millions of my party workers
 isliye apmaan sahan kiya
 But brothers and sisters
 unka iraadaa nek nahin tha
 The disciples said this to our friend
 congress ke saath jud jaao
 There is an opportunity to become Prime Minister

 This betrayal is with you

 Last night i was watching TV

 Why is Modi saying Shahzada? ye naubat kyon ai he
 If i say Shahzade you feel bad, then this country also feels bad with this dynasty
 congress vaada kare, vah vanshavaad chhod degi
 i will stop saying shehzada
 jepi loktantr ke liye jie, jujhate rahe, uske liye jail main jindagi gujaarne ko taiyaar rahe
 Democracy has four enemies

 Poison of casteism, corruption of power and communalism

 Under the Common Agenda, you spoke for the good of the country

 Should we forgive such people? ye congress ne satta pate hi kaha tha ki ganga kii safai karenge
 Today, see the entire Ganges
 ek prakaar se bimariyon kaa garh banaakar rakh diya he
 Should our Ganges be clean, dear dear? congress ko ye vaada puraa karnaa chahie tha ki nahin
 My young friends, this Congress had said that they would come to power and give employment to the youth
 wo to diya nahin, mahangaai badha di
 Today, the poor's house does not burn
 bachche raat raat rote hai
 Mother tears her tears

 Shouldn't the poor's plate have bread? bhaaiyon bahanon
 Today my farmer is also dying due to inflation
 jis tarah se khaad kii keemten bad rahi hai
 And see this government
 kisaan ko khaad mil nahin rahaa he
 But the manure factory installed in your eyelash has locks on it
 desh ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 But this Delhi government

 brothers Sisters
 hindustan main garibon kii bhalaai ke liye ek bees sutri program chalata he

 Stands at number twentieth
 ye garibon ke naam par roti senkane vaale log
 Has made fun

 He says that if your household income is 26 rupees a day
 vah garib nahin he
 Do you agree are 26 rupee main parivaar ko chaay nahin milti
 One of their leaders says that food is available for five rupees
 inhen garibi or bhukh kaa pataa nahin he
 He did not see poverty

 The Pakistanis killed him

 But such a government is sitting here

 Drowners who insult my army

 My brothers from Bihar

 Bihar's BJP has asked the Delhi government for a package of fifty thousand crores

 More than seven thousand for Bihar
 bihar main ye jo sampradayik sadbhaav kii baaten kar rahe hai
 Bihar's quota is of seven thousand, applications of those who come are only six thousand
 kyon kyonki bihar ke garib musalmaan ke paas paise nahin hai
 Will how? or gujarat main haj kaa kota saadhe chaar hajaar he
 But the application comes for forty thousand
 ye kyon aati hai
 Because the Muslim there is happy
 gujarat main kuccha auki bharuch kaa jila, jahaan sabase zyada musalamaanon kii sabase zyada aabaadi he
 If the maximum progress of any district is happening in the whole of Gujarat, then it is happening in both these districts
 ye logon ke haath main hamaare virdohi dhul jhonk rahe hai
 i am from poor Muslims
 main garib hindu bhaaiyon se puch rahe hai
 My poor Hindu brother told that you have to fight against Muslims
 yaa garibi ke khilaaf
 (against crowd poverty) i want to ask the poor Muslim that you have to fight against the Hindu
 yaa garibi ke khilaaf (bheed garibi ke khilaaf)aao ham donon milakar garibi ke khilaaf ladayen
 Today, they are giving reverse advice to the country
 main aapako vaada karne aayaa hum
 i have come to say hamaari sarkaar kaa ek hi majahab he or ye majahab he india first
 Nation first

 The government has only one devotion, Bharat Bhakti, one power

 Long live Mother India

 You will go from here koi jaldbaaji nahin karegaa

 Peace should not hurt anywhere in India

INDIA xxrep 5 ! :) Proud of our team xxrep 5 ! :) # iamfamily:) # CWC15— sushmita sen (@thesushmitasen)february 15, 2015- input IANS The Peoples Democratic party-bjp alliance, which began with a hug of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Saeed with full fanfare in Jammu and Kashmir, seems to be staggering within a fortnight
 jameen par dekhne se lag rahaa tha ki nai sarkaar thik-thaak kaam kar rahi he
 The government, formed on March 1, was greeted by unseasonal snowfall, but work began immediately to clear the road and provide relief services
 lekin is bemail gathbandhan ke bich pehle se ghoshit antaravirodh or usase utpann bechaini khulkar saamne aa gai he
 There is a round of accusations in the studios of television channels in Parliament House and Delhi
 gathbandhan ke satta main aane ke sirf saat din ke bheetar hi bikharaav kaa yah shor charam par pahunch gaya, jab 7 march ko 42 varshiya masarrat alam kii rihaai hui
 Masrat is actually the leader of the second line of Syed Ali Shah Geelani's separatist Hurriyat faction
 masarrat par aarope he ki 2010 kii garmiyon main kashmir ghati main pradarshnon or patharav ko uksaane main uskaa bada haath tha
 More than a hundred young people died in these incidents
 masarrat ko takneekee baarikiyon ke aadhaar par aisi prakriya ke jariye choda gaya, jisaki shuruyaat disambar main chunavi nattejey aane ke baad 49 din ke rajyapal shashan ke dauraan hui thi
 But when the Chief Minister, the Director General of Police of the state
 rajendra ko ''sabhi rajnatik bandiyon" kii rihaai kii prakriya shuru karne kaa aadesh diya, uske teen din ke bheetar masarrat ko chode jane se hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya
 BJP ministers, who are making a habit of enjoying power in Jammu, awakened with fury of their supporters
 ek mantri ne bataaya ki televijan par alam kii rihaai kii khabar aate hi unhone ''100 se zyada logon ke, phone par gusse bhare colls kaa jawaab diya
 i had never seen people so angry
 "pehle saptaah main mufti mohammad said ek ke baad ek, ekatarfa elaan karte rahe
 First, he thanked the cooperation of Pakistan, Hurriyat separatists and militants in getting more votes than usual in the assembly elections
 jammu or dilli donon jagah bijepi netaaon ne jaan-boojhkar kaan band rakhe or mukhyamantri ke bayaan se khud ko ''alag kar" khamosh ho gaye
 When some of the PDP mlas demanded the return of Afzal Guru's remains guilty of an attack on Parliament and the statements made by Mufti Saeed about political prisoners, there was no such response as on the release of Masrat
 sansad main puri tarah ghir jane ke baad grahamantri rajnath singh ne do baar jammu-kashmir sarkaar se spashtikaran maanga
 Prime Minister Modi also had to accept that his Mufti government did not consult his government on the decision to leave Masrat Alam, amid his sarcastic teachings about patriotism
 jab pataa laga ki 2010 se jammu-kashmir naagarik suraksha kanoon ke tahat band masarrat alam kii rihaai rajyapal shashan ke dauraan shuru hui prakriya kii dein he tab to jahiraa taur par sarkaar kii kirakiri hui or rajnath singh ko kahana padaa ki unki party pidipi ke saath gathjod todgaye se bhi nahin hichakegi
 He said at a CISF event in Ghaziabad, "my government will not compromise on national security at any cost
" gathbandhan kii ho chaahe koi or, hamaare liye sarkaar praathamikta nahin he
 "this was never disclosed to journalists but according to BJP insiders, President Amit Shah had given a similar strict warning to Mufti Saeed on phone on Tuesday
 unhone rajya main bijepi ke up-mukhyamantri nirmal kumaar singh or pradesh adhyaksh jugal kishor sharma ko bhi hidaayat di he ki ve mufti said kii chaalon par baariki se najar rakhen
 In view of all these incidents, the Ministry of Home Affairs is preparing to send a consultation to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir to inform the accused accused in the "matters discussed" before their release
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya bijepi mufti said se naata todgaye kii apni dhamkee ke bare main gambhir he? pidipi ke mukhya pravaktaa naeem akhtar ne bataaya, ''mujhe nahin lagata ki ve itani jaldbaaji karenge
 "now in the new government, Minister Akhtar said this while pointing to the long and difficult process of linking the alliance that seems impossible in the eyes of everyone
 tivi channelon ke studio main antaheen bahes kaa ullekh karte hue ve kehete hai, ''main to bas yahi kaamana karata hum ki kashmiriyon ko bhaavnaatmak str par shesh bharat se phir jodne kii hamaari koshishen televijan kii tiarapy kii bhent na chadh jaaen
 "but the BJP leaders, who are facing the people's anger in Jammu, are confused
 ve maanate hai ki mufti said ne gathbandhan ke agenda yaa nunatam saajha kaarykram kaa sidhe-sidhe koi ulanghan nahin kiya he
 a BJP leader clearly said that keeping the "provocative" actions like the release of Masrat "to continue this alliance" would be detrimental to the party
 "gathbandhan main takaraav kaa sanket tab bhi dekhne ko mila jab bijepi netaa in khabaron se kshubdh the ki party mahasachiv ram madhav mufti said se milakar apni chintaaen bataaenge
 a member of the party in Jammu said, "what is the need of Ram Madhav to meet the Mufti?" This will increase their sentiment
 " philhal aisa lagata he ki donon taraf se sulah ke bayanon se maamla shant ho gaya he
 The Chief Minister assured Delhi that no political prisoners would be released without consulting them
 pradesh bijepi mahasachiv ashok kaul ne bhi kaha he ki unki party ''un rajnatik bandiyon kii rihaai ke khilaaf nahin he jin par koi maamla darj nahin he
 "the first round in this match has been in favor of Saeed and PDP and BJP is in trouble
 masarrat kii rihaai kaa faisla kashmir se sambhddha sabhi pakshon se baat karne kii mufti said kii ghoshit niti ke daayre main he
 More than that, it has been conveyed that the Mufti government is different from Omar Abdullah's National Conference (which wanted to keep Masrat away from the people)
 isse said ko ghati main apane matadaataaon ke saamne yah sabit karne kaa mauka bhi mil gaya ki bijepi ke saath gathjod karne se kashmir ke liye ''swashaasan" kaa unka sapana katai kamjor nahin hua he
 He did not seem to have much problem with the Center in this matter, but the Mufti's assessment of the bjp's Hajme seems apparently to be wrong
 2003-04 main ghati main updrav rokane kii karrwai ke dauraan hijbul mujahidin ke ek ke baad ek teen chif cmanderon-gulam hasan khan urf saf-ul-islam, gulam rasul daar urf gaji nasiruddin or abdur rashid pir urf sardaar pir ko goli maar di gai thi
 At that time the Mufti was the Chief Minister of the state
 is karrwai ke baad hui hinsa main pidipi kaaryakartaaon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya lekin mufti tus se mas nahin hue, jiske liye us samay dilli main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ne unki bahut tarif kii
 This was not known anywhere, but the Mufti had entered into a deal with the Center's intermediaries, especially intelligence agencies, to stop illegal detention
 ve gilaani ko ehtiyaati najarbandi se chhudwane main bhi safal rahe the
 But there is no evidence that the Modi government has met Delhi in the same manner as Mufti Saeed had received from Vajpayee after the wiping out of Hizbul Mujahideen commanders
 bijepi ke saath unka maujuuda takaraav paraspar sweekaarya sahmati se bhale hi shant ho gaya ho lekin isse puri ghati main mukhyamantri kaa kad bahut bad gaya he
 Pir Ji, Director, Center for Research and Development Policy, a study center based in Srinagar
 en
 Suhail believes that Mufti Saeed has managed to show people that "after a long time, he is the first chief minister who is not afraid of Delhi
" "is tarah se, agle kisi bhi chunaav main or khaas taur par pidipi-bijepi gathjod samay se pehle tut jane par hone vaale chunaav main nishchit taur par mufti ko bahut phayda hoga
 a Bharatiya Janata Party leader, on the condition of not disclosing his identity, said, "the political equation of Jammu and Kashmir may have eliminated BJP forever
" " mufti sarkaar main mantri naeem kaa kahana he, ''mufti sahab yakeenan nae chunaav ke bare main nahin soch rahe hai
 Describing the Mufti's decision to tie up with the BJP under Modi's leadership as a "bold but well thought out move", Naeem says that breaking the alliance would be a "personal failure" of the chief minister
 donon dal chaahate hai ki gathbandhan kaamyaab ho
 Under the mutually acceptable agenda of running the government, the two parties have decided to keep the contradictions and unexpected setbacks such as foul play in the release of political prisoners at the moment
 aise main soobe main nai sarkaar se ummid barkaraar he

 Giving a statement with brazenness 'gauratlab he ki chidambaram nejammu-kashmir ko adhik swaittatadene kii himaayat kii, jisaki bijepi ne tikhi aalochana kii thi
 At the same time, the Congress party also distanced itself from this statement of Chidambaram

 Many times chalisa was written on the leaders and sometimes aarti
 siyasat main jab bade netaaon kii najaron main aana ho to aise kii karnaamein kar kai log apane makasad main kaamyaab ho jate hai
 This is the reason that many leaders also won the status of 'god'
 or ye silsilaa jari he
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday that a National Center for 'himalaya Studies' will be established in Uttarakhand

 i have proposed to set up a National Center for Himalayan Studies in the state of Uttarakhand
 ' There has been tension in the village since this incident
 nagarikon ko suraksha pradaan karne main prashasan kii kathith vifaltaa ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe sthaneey logon ko shant karne ke liye jiladhikari ashish chouhan or police adheekshak dadan paal ghatnasthal par pahunche
 Before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Mumbai Congress seems to be battling Anduruni factionalism
 mumbai congress adhyaksh sanjay nirupam ke netritv ke khilaaf rahul gandhi ke kareebi maane jane vaale milind devda ne bagawati tevar akhriyaar kar liya he
 Deora has said that she is not at all happy with what is going on in the party
 isse mumbai congress ke andruni kalah ko bakhubi samajha ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, how will the Congress compete with the Narendra Modi-led BJP in the 2019 elections? Let us know that Milind Deora has tweeted that Sanjay Nirupam does not want to take anyone along, which is fatal for the party before the election
 isse pehle mumbai congress main aisa kabhi nahin hua he
 We need to bring people together in the country's economic and cultural city, Mumbai
 mumbai congress sampradayik raajnneeti ke liye ek cricket pich nahin ban sakati he, jisamen netaa ek duusare ke khilaaf khadey kiye jaaen
 He further wrote in the tweet, 'I am disappointed in what is happening and the party is aware of my stand to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki mujhe kendriya netritv or hamaari party kii vichaardhaara or siddhanton ke prati unka purna vishwaas he
 Especially in Mumbai, where the Congress was born
 darasal, mumbai congress kii siyasat do dhadon main pehle se hi bati rahi he
 While one faction led by Gurudas Kamat, the other group was from Murali Deora
 maujuuda samay murali devda ke siyaasi viraasat ko milind devda sambhaal rahe hai
 Gurudas Kamat has passed away in August 2018
 is tarah se kaamat gut ke kuch log milind ke saath jute gaye hai or kuch log mumbai congress mahasachiv dharmesh vyas ke saath jud gaye
 After Sanjay Nirupam joined the Congress from Shiv Sena and became the Mumbai President, he has set up his own team bypassing the people of Gurudas Kamat and Murali Deora faction
 nirupam ne mumbai congress adhyaksh ke naate vipaksh main rahakar sangharsh kar wo mumbai main congress kaa cheharaa banakar ubhare hai
 Whether it is to encircle the BJP government of Maharashtra or to go on the road against the policies of the Modi government
 in donon kaamon wo lagaataar kar rahe hai
 Interestingly, in all these movements, there was no big Congress face on the road to support Sanjay Nirupam
 sanjay nirupam ke badhate varchasv ke khilaaf pichley 6 maheene se kai pratinidhi mandal ne congress alaakaman se milakar unke khilaaf shikaayat kii he, lekin abhi tak unhen kamyaabi nahin mil saki
 Not only this, in September 2018, Congress leaders led by Milind Deora met Congress in-charge of Maharashtra, Mallikarjun Kharge in Mumbai and talked about the removal of Sanjay Nirupam from the post of Mumbai Congress President
 mallikarjun khadge se mulaakaat ke baad asantusht netaaon ko ummid thi nirupam ke khilaaf alaakaman kuch kadam uthaae jaaenge, lekin kuch nahin hua
 Since then, dissatisfaction has increased even more
 darasal, sanjay nirupam se khilaaf milind devda kii takaraav kii ek badi vajah mumbai uttar-pashchim loksabhaa seat bhi maani ja rahi he
 Gurudas Kamat has been contesting from this seat, which Sanjay Nirupam is claiming
 isi seat par kripashankar singh bhi chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 Although Sanjay Nirupam wanted to contest from the same seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, but under pressure from Kamat, he agreed to contest from the Mumbai North seat
 ab 2019 ke ran main kaamat kii sansadeey seat se nirupam daavedaari jataa rahe hai
 In such a situation, Milind has got the support of Kripa Shankar Singh and he has campaigned against the leadership of Sanjay Nirupam
 isse saaf jaahir he ki mumbai congress main andruni gutbaji kaa pani khatre ke nishaan ke bahut upar bah rahaa he
 The controversial video assistant referee technology (VAR) will debut in Russia during the 2018 World Cup, in which referees can consult the video referee by making a screen signal with their fingers

 If you play well then you lead the team to victory
 yah pari khelkar sachmuch acha lag rahaa he
 "he said," Before my innings in Perth, i was wondering what would be going on in the media but after that i stopped watching the news
 maine khud ko sakaaratmak sochane ke liye kaha or yah bhi ki ran nahin banane kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 i kept faith and i think that was what was important
 ’kohli ne kaha ki unhone trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke pichley maichon main kuch galtiyaan kii thi jinamein yahaan sudhaar karne kii koshish kii
 He said, 'I made some mistakes in the last matches and got out after scoring 20 and 30 runs
 maine prayek gend khilne kii koshish kii or antarrashtriya cricket main hameshaa aisa nahin hota he
 This is probably my best innings in odis
 yah behad khaas ahsaas he
 Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene said that no one can do anything when a player like Kohli is performing like this on the ideal pitch for batting
 unhone kaha, ‘jab vah is tarah se ballebaaji kar rahaa ho tab aap kuch nahin kar sakate
 Our bowlers performed poorly for the first time in the tournament
 keval kohli hi nahin anya ballebaajon ne bhi behtareen khel dikhaaya
 Jayawardene, however, appeared confident of qualifying for the finals
 unhone kaha, ‘kwalifai karnaa ab bhi hamaare haath main jo ki acha he
 Hopefully we will overcome this defeat and win in Melbourne

 During the two-day stay in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress national vice president Rahul Gandhi's lesson from veterans to elected representatives to unite and warn them to stay away from power if they do not remember it will be remembered by those leading factions in the state Questions are beginning to arise
 rajya main congress gutbaji kaa paryaay ban chuki he
 In the past three decades, the factionalism that started from above has deepened
 yahi kaaran he ki jamini str par kaaryakarta kii pahchaan congress kaaryakarta ke taur par kam gutiy netaa ke jhandabardaar ke taur par zyada hoti he
 Here the worker belongs first to the group and then to the Congress
 rajya main isi varsh vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Rahul Gandhi had a two-day stay in view of how ready Congress workers are for this election and what is the ground reality
 unhone dhar jile ke mohankheda va rajdhani bhopal main vartmaan saansad, vidhayakon se lekar, haare ummidavaaron, vikaskhand str tak ke padaadhikariyon ke alaava panchayat va nagareey nikaay ke pratinidhiyon kii class lagaai
 In this class, people got a chance to openly speak
 yahi kaaran tha ki kai kaaryakartaaon ne aagaamee bure parinaamon kii parvaah kiye bina hi vah kah daalaa jo ab tak ve kehane kaa saahas nahin juta pate the
 The names of the leaders who led the factions Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Kantilal Bhuria and Suresh Pachauri were openly mentioned by these activists
 yahaan tak kah daalaa ki inhen netaaon ke kaaran party harati he
 The talk by representatives of different levels touched Gandhi's heart
 yahi kaaran tha ki bhopal main panchayat va nagareey nikaay ke nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ke saamne unhone gutbaji kii charchaa kar daali
 Also assured that now some leaders will not decide the candidature of the party, but district and block level officials will play an important role in it
 rahul gandhi ne ek taraf jahaan nichle str ke padaadhikariyon ko party main mahatv milane kaa bharosa dilaayaa to vahiin bade netaaon ko chetavanee bhi di
 He clearly said that if factionalism persists, victory in the state will remain a dream
 aisi sthiti main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko haraana aasaan nahin he
 The mantra of victory is just solidarity
 vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh ajay singh bhi maanate hai ki gandhi ne netaaon ko chetavanee va naseehat di he
 Also said that the priority is the strength and victory of the Congress, only then there is something else
 party nichle str ke kaaryakartaaon kii sahmati se vidhansabha ke chunaav se teen maah pehle tikat de degi
 This will benefit the party
 rahul ne is daure main kaaryakartaaon se lekar netaaon tak ko ekajutata kaa paath padhaayaa or gutbaji khatm karne kii hidaayat di, magar rahul yah nahin jaanate hai ki rajya main gutbaji khatm karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Leadership of the leaders of this place runs through this factionalism
 gutbaji ke kaaran hi ve bade netaa bane hue hai
 Elections are close, so the leaders will have to remember the lesson taught, but who remembers how much can not be guessed from now

 Therefore, it would be better for these sports to learn to respect sports lovers, at least not to insult them even by forgetting

 At present, there is a BJP government both in the country and the state
 aise main akhilesh bijepi ke astr se use hi maat dene kii koshish main hai
 Akhilesh has told the streets of Ram Nagari that he will face the BJP in 2019 in the struggle and Ram Bharosa
 rashtrawaad ko bhi akhilesh ne banaaya hathiyaarapradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley hafte hi man kii baat kaarykram main kaha tha ki agast kaa maheenaa ek tarah se kranti kaa maheenaa he
 This month should be celebrated as the month of revolution, so that the younger generation of the country can understand the sacrifice made for freedom
 ek agast ko asahyog andolan or nau agast ko bharat chodo andolan shuru hua tha
 The country became independent on 15 August
 modi kii is agast kranti ke jawaab main sapa pramukh akhilesh ne 9 agast yani kranti diwas ke din hi'desh bachaao-desh banaao' kaa aagaajakia
 Actually, the issue of nationalism has been at the center of politics for the last few days and the BJP has been cashing in on it
 aise main bijepi or modi donon ke mukbale akhilesh ne khadey hone kii koshish kii he
 Akhilesh Yadav has given the Samajwadi Party a new look by removing it from its old and traditional image
 party par lage parivaarwaad ke tamge or gundon kii party kii chhavi se bhi baahar nikaalane kii unki kavayad he
 Akhilesh took the command of the party in his own hands and first side-lined his uncle Shivpal Yadav and kept away from the leaders of criminal image
 akhilesh ye bhi chaahate hai ki sapa ko keval yadavon-muslimon kii party na samajha jaae
 In the current phase of becoming a strong face of the opposition, there is no face of the opposition against Narendra Modi, who can lead the opposition in 2019
 kuch samay pehle tak log nitish kumaar ko vipaksh ke chehre ke taur par dekh rahe the, lekin bhaajapa ke sang unke mil jane se ye jagah puri tarah se khaali he
 In such a situation, new hope has been raised among the satrap leaders
 akhilesh yadav is baat ko bakhubi samaj rahe hai ki wo modi ke khilaaf bigul foonkane main kaamyaab ho jate hai, to nishchat rup se wo vipaksh kaa ek majboot cheharaa ban jaaenge
 SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary is also claiming that Akhilesh Yadav is a leader with a clean image, he has not done as much development work as the Chief Minister of UP for five years in any previous government
 vipakshi netaaon se akhilesh ke rishte madhukhilesh yadav ke vipakshi partiyon se rishte madhur hai
 In alliance with Rahul Gandhi, he has also contested assembly elections
 jeet bhale hi na mili ho lekin ye rishte ab bhi barkaraar hai
 Apart from this, Akhilesh has also thrown out the thorns that were in sp's relationship with Mayawati
 mayawati kaa sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav se chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he
 These two leaders have not interfered in SP these days
 aise main mayawati ko bhi akhilesh ke saath jane main ab koi badi dikkat nahin hogi
 Recently, Akhilesh had clearly said that he has no problem in going with BSP
 bijepi ko haraane ke liye wo kisi ke saath bhi ja sakate hai
 Both BSP and SP have lost their base in the state these days, in such a situation no party can compete with Modi alone
 sapa ke liye 2019 kaa chunavi aagaajasmajawaadee party ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne ajtak dot in se kaha ki modi sarkaar ne teen saal main desh kaa bedaa gark kar diya he
 The voice of disagreement is being suppressed by the BJP government in an undemocratic manner
 yogi raaj main kisaan tabah hai or mahilaayein asurakshit hai
 Not only this, the future of students and youth is also being played with
 unhone kaha ki is abhiyaan ke jariye sapa 2019 kaa chunavi aagaaj kar rahi he

 New equations of politics are being formed and all the small parties are working to increase their strength by alliance with each other
 har taraf yahi sawaal he ki 2019 main kiski banegi sarkaar or kiski hogi haar
 In the midst of this noise of politics, Aaj Tak, in his survey with Karvy Insights, got the mood of the country and tried to find the answer to the question whether the results like 2014 will be repeated in 2019 or this time there will be a new government at the Center
 survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki 2014 ke mukaable 2019 main voton ke maamle main bahut antar aayaa he
 In 2014, the NDA got 38 per cent of the votes while the UPA had only 23 per cent votes
 anya dalon ke hisse main tab 39 fisadi vot gaye the
 We know that this vote percentage gave the bjp-led ADA an overwhelming majority at the Center and Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister
 uske baad har chah maheene baad ajtak ke survey desh kaa mizaaj main ye vot pratishat badalata rahaa
 In the survey for this month, the NDA is expected to get 35 per cent and the UPA 33 per cent
 anya dalon ke hisse main baaki ke 32 fisadi vot ja rahe hai
 When this vote share is converted into seats, then the picture of Lok Sabha for the next five years becomes clear
 tasviir ye ki 16veen loksabhaa trishanku hogi jisamen kisi bhi dal yaa gathbandhan ko apane dam par bahumat nahin milane ja rahaa he
 bjp-led NDA is the biggest loser and its seats can be reduced from 99 to 237
 upie jabardast vaapasi karata dikh rahaa he lekin satta se kaaphi dur rahane vaala he
 Its seats are increasing by 106 and it is expected to get 166 seats
 vahiin anya dalon ko bhi nuksaan ho rahaa he
 They can win 140 seats, compared to 153 last time
 survey ke nateezon se saaf he ki 2014 ke mukaable 2019 main endie ko teen fisadi voton kaa nuksaan hone kaa anumaan he jabaki upie ke khate main puure 10 fisadi atirikt vot ja rahe hai or wo 2014 ke 23 fisadi ke mukaable 2019 main 33 fisadi vot hasil kar saktaa he
 Other parties are incurring heavy losses as compared to 2014
 2014 main unke kul vot 39 fisadi the lekin is baar yani 2019 main unhen mahaj 32 fisadi vot milane kaa anumaan he
 The political parties included in the NDA in this survey include Bharatiya Janata Party, All India n Rangaswamy Congress, Apna Dal, Bodo People's Front, DMDA, Janata Dal United, Assam Gana Parishad, Naga People's Front, PMK, National People's Party, RPI (A), Shiromani Akali Dal, Sikkim Democratic Front and Shiv Sena

 After giving the product to e-retailers for this sale, Sony India sales head Satish Padmanabhan told an English newspaper that as a brand he does not want to deceive his customers by doing some special deal with an e-commerce platform
 lihaaja, aise online cell ofer ke liye companiyon ne saaf shart rakhi ki unke product ko bazaar main bik rahi keemton par hi bechaa jaae

 So that their direct selling is not damaged

 "" i leave (to Mumbai) when there is no work
 kaam hota he tabhi mumbai main hota hum
 Otherwise i stay outside, i keep roaming
 mujhe ekant acha lagata he
 i do nothing in isolation
 kabhi padhata hum, kabhi kuch dekh rahaa hota hum kabhi kuch nahin karata hum
 i am sitting for hours
