unhone jis kathin parishram se apni manzil paayi thi or jo anubhav unhen praapt hue the, ve mujhe apane unheen anubhavon se labhanvit karke apane se bhi ucch padaadhikari bananaa chaahate the
 His decision was just and reasonable, yet i could not accept his point
 meraa unke faisle se vimukh hona aisa tha jaise mujhe apane pita ke itani aayu ke anubhavon, gyaan tathaa vivek par jaraa bhi vishwaas na ho
 i did not even think that as a father, he had the right to decide about me
 tab main kareeb gyaarah varsh kaa rahaa hounga
 My father tried to explain me a lot by telling me the difference between good and evil, high and low
 mujhe danta, fatkaaraa, dhamkaaya bhi, prem se sarkari naukari ke laabh va suvidhaon kii babat bhi bataaya, magar mere kaan par jun tak nahin rengi
 After all, even his blood was pouring in my veins, i had inherited his stubborn nature from him
 meraa yah drudh nishchay tha ki kisi bhi keemat par sarkari naukari nahin karuunga
 Even the many types of temptation of father could not deter me from my decision
 darasal main kuch zyada hi mahattvakankshi tha
 Soon after completing my reading and reading, i used to go out to visit the places i wanted
 aaj jab main apane us vigat jivan ke bare main sochataa hum, to mujhe bada vismay hota he, ki aakhir aisa kya kaaran tha, jo prakruti ne mujhe itnaa mohit kar liya tha? un dinon main prakruti ke prati itnaa anuraagi ho gaya tha ki meri skool main anivaary upasthiti bhi nahin ho saki
 There was bitterness between my father and my relations
 ab ham aapas main koi kaam nahin karte the, kintu hamaare bich mook virdohi kii sthiti bani hui thi
 But when i realized that now i would not be able to work without talking to my father, i decided to talk to him
 main sarkari pad praapt kar ek kursi se chipaknaa nahin chahta tha
 i did not like running a pan on idle farms all day
 maine pitaaji se kaha–‘‘pitaaji ! main sarkari naukari karne kaa icchhuk nahin hum, balki chitrakaar bananaa chahta hum
 "my statement ignited the spark of his anger
" unhone chetavanee bhare lahaze main kaha–‘‘chitrakaar


! jab tak meri mrityu nahin ho jaati, tumhaari yah bachakaani ichha purna hona asambhav he

 i did not pay any attention to the remaining subjects
 isi kaaran main apni kaksha main in donon vishyon main pratham rahaa, kintu anya vishyon main pichad gaya
 Due to a deep study of history, i got two benefits - the first benefit was that my nationalist outlook was sharpened

 Prior to nationalization, their purpose and banking system were slightly different, but with the nationalization of major banks, there have been drastic changes in the working conditions and direction of operations within them

 Indira Gandhi, the architect of bank nationalization, was confident that this banking industry would accelerate the overall development and revival of the nation
 bainkon ke rashtriyakaran ke aitihaasik parv kii shuruuaat karte samay shrimati indiraji ne kaha tha ki "banking pranali jaisi sanstha, jo hajaaron -lakhon logon tak pahunchati he or jise lakhon logon tak pahunchaana chahie, ke peeche aavashyak rup se koi bada saamaajik uddeshy hona chahie jisase vah prerit ho or in kshetron ko chahie ki vah rashtriya praathamiktaaon tathaa uddeshyon ko puraa karne main apana yogadan den
 "in the process of making this belief meaningful, six banks with deposits of more than Rs 200 crore were nationalized on April 15, 1980
 rashtriyakaran se purv sabhi vanijyik bainkon kii apni alag or swatantra nitiyaan hoti thim or unka uddeshy adhikadhik laabh ke margon ko prashast karne tak hi simit tha jo swaabhaavik hi mana janaa chahie kyonki in bainkon ke adhiktar share-dharak kuch ine-gine puunjipati vyakti the jo apane hiton kii raksha ke saath nijee hitadhikariyon ko hi banking sevaaon evam suvidhaon kaa laabh pahunchaate the
 People from poor, weaker sections, Dalits and general rural sections of the society did not even know which bank the name of the bank is
 at: ve din-pratidin seth-sahukaaron evam mahajanon ke sood ke neeche itane dab gaye ki jivan kii asli pahchaan tak bhul gaye
 In fact, India is inhabited in villages and farmers and agricultural laborers reside in the villages
 bank rashtriyakaran ke purv kisaanon kii haalat itani kharaab hoti thi ki unke bare main ek kadava satya kaha jaataa he ki bhartiya kisaan karj main hi janm letaa he
 He grows up in debt and dies only after leaving debt behind
 falat: aisi dasha main puunjipati adhik dhanwaan hote gaye tathaa nirdhan or bhi garibi ke do paaton main pisate gaye or desh main bhayankar saamaajik asantulan kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya
 Along with social imbalance, the nation got entangled in the leprosy of tremendous economic inequalities
 is prakaar saamaajik tathaa aarthik vikaas kii gati avaruddh hoti gai jiske falswaroop krantikari nai aarthik niti kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii jane lagi thi at: desh kii arthvyavastha kii ridh kii chhadi bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran karke unhen desh ke vikaas pravaah main shaamil kiya janaa ek rashtriya aavashyakta thi
 As a result, banks were nationalized
 is rashtriyakaran main mul uddeshy yahi rahaa ki banking pranali desh ke aarthik vikaas mulak kaaryon main sakriy sahyog pradaan karke banking sevaaon evam suvidhaon kaa laabh samaaj ke kamjor virgon sahit anya sabhi kshetron ko pahunchane main ahm bhoomika adaa karen
 Thus the primary objectives were to nationalize the major commercial banks
 banking suvidhaon tathaa sevaaon kaa vistaar karnaa, rashtriyakaran ke pehle bankig sevaaye kuch poojipatiyon evam bade vyapaaree tathaa kisaanon tak hi simit thim jiske falswaroop samaaj ke do virgon main bahut badi aarthik daraar utpann ho gai thi
 To overcome this economic inequality, the basic objective of taking advantage of banking services and facilities to all sections of the society, especially to the weaker sections in rural towns, lies in the nationalization of banks
 desh kaa aarthik vikaas doosraa uddeshy mana ja saktaa he
 As has been said earlier, before the bank nationalization, the pace of economic growth was blocked due to the economic crisis in the country
 at: desh ke aarthik vikaas main teji laane ke liye bainko kaa rashtriyakaran kiya janaa bahut hi aavashyak ho gaya tha kyonki kisi bhi desh kii pragati evam khushhaali ke liye uske aarthik vikaas kii hi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahati he
 The third objective of bank nationalization was the problem of unemployment in the country
 yah bharatvarsh kii mukhya chintaa rahi he ki bainkon ke rashtriyakaran ke madhyam se is samasya kaa samaadhaan khoja ja saktaa tha kyonki shikshit berozegaron ko aarthik sahaayta ke madhyam se unke apane nijee udyog yaa swarozgaar ke anek sadhano main vruddhi karke berogari par kaabo paaya ja saktaa tha
 Until the problem of unemployment is resolved in the country, its development work cannot accelerate
 is tathy ko drushtigat rakhkar berogari unmoolan kii disha main thos kadam uthaae janaa jaruri ho gaya tha taaki banking sevaaon tathaa sahaayta kaa laabh shikshit berozegaron ko milakar ve apni unnati ke nae maarg prashast kar saken
 One of the objectives of bank nationalization was also to provide a new direction to the economic growth of the country by uplifting the people of low thrust sections of society and priority sectors through banking services and facilities
 desh ke kamjor varg tathaa praathamikta praapt kshetron ke log arthath chote tathaa manzole kisaan, bhoomihin majdoor, shikshit berozegaar, chote karigar aadi kii aarthik unnati main yogadan diya janaa bahut aavashyak ho gaya tha kyonki aise virgon ke log deshbhar main faile hue the or unki sankhya kaaphi thi
 They were also expected in society
 at: virgon ke logon main nayaa aatmavishvaas paidaa karke unhen unnati evam khushahali ke maarg par laana desh kii sarvageen pragati ke liye bahut jaruri ho gaya tha
 Therefore, their development was possible only through banking facility
 falat: bank rashtriyakaran kaa vichaar saamne aayaa
 Another basic objective of nationalization of banks was to improve the condition of rural areas and to make proper progress in the areas of agriculture and small scale industries
 bhartiya kisaan yug-yug se upekshit hi rahaa or har baar vah auron se chusataa hi gaya
 As a result, he could not rise above the layers of poverty
 yahi haalat kutir udyog evam laghu udyogon kii thi
 These businesses mostly depended on agriculture and due to neglect and underdevelopment of agriculture and agriculture, these industries too could not progress
 is prakaar, krishi evam laghu udyog jaise upekshit kshetron kii ore uchit dhyaan dekar unki aarthik sthiti main sudhaar laayaa janaa raashtra kii pragati ke liye bahut aavashyak tathaa anivaary ho gaya tha
 Promoting the new creation of new small-scale industries by reviving the country's ailing industries was also an objective of nationalization of banks
 biimaar udyogon ke kaaran berogari kii samasya main vruddhi hokar aarthik mandi failane kaa yah bhi ek kaaran tha at: aise udyogon ko aarthik sahaayta dekar punarujjivit karnaa aavashyak tha
 At the same time the number of small-scale industries was not enough, which was not able to accelerate the progress of the towns and such entrepreneurs were always sitting with their eyes towards the foreign countries
 at: desh kii pragati ke liye laghu-stareey udyogon ko badhaava diya janaa bhi atyant jaruri tha joki aarthik sahaayta ke bagaiyr asambhav-sa prathit hota tha
 Therefore, the government's ownership of them became an essential thing for economic planning by banks

 Later, on Ramachandra Deb establishing an independent kingdom in Khurda, the temple and its idols were restored
 
 According to the traditional legend associated with the origin of this temple, the original idol of Lord Jagannath made of Indranil or Sapphire was found under an Agaru tree
 yah itani chakchaundh karne vaali thi, ki dharm ne ise prithvi ke neeche chupaana chaha
 Malwa King Indradyumna saw this idol in his dream
 tab usne kadi tapasya kii or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne use bataaya ki vah puri ke samudr tat par jaye or use ek daaru kaa laththa milegaa
 He should build the idol with the same wood
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or use lakdi kaa laththa mil bhi gaya
 The king then appeared before him as Vishnu and Vishwakarma carpenter artisan and sculptor
 kintu unhone yah shart rakhi, ki ve ek maah main murti taiyaar kar denge, parantu tab tak vah ek kamare main band rahenge or raja yaa koi bhi us kamare ke andar nahin aaye
 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin
 Then the idols of the same three Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were installed in the temple
 
 Some historians believe that this temple was formerly a Buddhist stupa in its place
 us stupa main gautam buddha kaa ek daant rakhaa tha
 It was later moved to its present position, Kandy, Sri Lanka

 In his last days, he had also asked that the world famous Kohinoor diamond, which is the most valuable and the largest diamond in the world, be donated to this temple
 lekin yah sambhav naa ho sakaa, kyoki us samay tak, british ne punjab par apana adhikaar karke, unki sabhi shahi sampatti jabt kar lee thi
 Otherwise Kohinoor diamond would have been the pride of the crown of Lord Jagannath

 According to Aryabhata, the Mahabharata war took place in 3137 BCE
 kaliyug kaa armbh krishna ke is yuddh ke 35 varsh pashchaat nidhan par hua
 According to Encyclopedia of Hinduism, the Kali Yuga started from 3102 BCE immediately after Lord Krishna's departure from this earth
 dharmraj yudhisthir, bhimsen, arjuna, nakul or sahadev paanchon pandav mahaparakramee parakshit ko rajya dekar mahaprayan hetu uttarakhand kii ore chale gayi or vahaan jaakar punyalok ko praapt huye
 The king began to rule according to Parikshit Dharma and according to the Brahmins
 uttar naresh kii putree iravati ke saath unhone apana vivaah kiya or us uttam patni se unke chaar putr utpann huye
 By making Acharya Krupa a Guru, he performed three Ashwamedha Yagyas on the banks of Jahnavi
 un yagyon main anant dhan raashi brahmanon ko daan main di or digvijay hetu nikal gayi
 At the same time, Dharma made the form of a bull and met Gaurupini Earth on the Saraswati coast
 gaurupini prithvi kii netron se ashru bah rahe the or vah shrihin si prathit ho rahi thi
 Religion asked the Earth - "oh God! Why are you being mistaken? What are you worried about? Are you worrying about me, now that i am left with only one foot or you are talking about this?" Worried that now the Shudra will rule over you? " prithvi boli - "he dharm! tum sarvajna hokar bhi mujh se mere dukh kaa kaaran poochhate ho! satya, pavitrataa, kshamaa, dayaa, santosh, tyaag, sham, dam, tap, saralata, kshamta, shaastra vichaar, uparati, titiksha, gyaan, vairaygy, shaury, tej, aishwarya, bal, smriti, kaanti, kaushal, swatantrata, nirbhikta, komalta, dhairya, saahas, sheel, vinay, saubhaahgya, utsaah, gambheertha, kirti, aastikta, sthirataa, gaurav, ahankaarhinta aadi gunon se yukt bhagwaan shrikrishna ke swadham gaman ke kaaran ghor kaliyug mere upar aa gaya he
 i have great grief for all of you as well as Dev, Pitrugan, Rishi, Sadhu, Sannyasi etc
 bhagwaan shrikrishna ke jin charnon kii seva lakshmi ji karti hai unamem camel, vajra, ankush, dhwaja aadi ke chihn virajman hai or ve hi charan mujh par padate the jisase main saubhagyawati thi
 Now my good luck has ended
 " While Dharma and Prithvi were talking about this, Kali Yuga came there as a crowned Shudra and started killing them both
 raja parakshit digvijay karte huye vahiin par se guzar rahe the
 They saw the crowned Shudra with a stick in his hand, beating a cow and a bull badly
 vah bail atyant sundar tha, uskaa shwet rang tha or keval ek pair tha
 The cow was also beautiful like Kamadhenu
 donon hi bhaybheet ho kar kaanp rahe the
 Maharaj Parikshit offered his bow and bowed in a solemn voice like a cloud - "O wicked! Sinner! Naradham! Who are you? Why are you torturing these innocent cows and bulls? You are a great criminal
" tere aparaadh kaa uchit dand tera vadh hi he
 "on hearing these words, Kali Yuga shivered with fear
 maharaj ne bail se poocha ki he bail tumhaare teen pair cas toote gayi hai
 You are a bull or a god
 he dhenuputr! tum nirbhiktapurvak apana apana vrutant mujhe bataao
 Hey Gaumata! Now you are free from fear
 main dushton ko dand detaa hoon
 Which evil has committed this stigma in the holy fame of the Pandavas by committing gross sins in my kingdom? Even if he is a sinful true God, i will cut off his hands too
 tab dharm bolaa - "he maharaj! aapane bhagwaan shrikrishna ke parambhakt pandavon ke kul main janm liya he atah ye vachan aap hi ke yogya hai
 Hey Rajan! We do not know who afflicts the creatures of the world
 shastron main bhi iskaa nirupan anek prakaar se kiya gaya he
 He who does not believe in duality accepts the cause of sorrow for himself
 koi praarabdh ko hi dukh kaa kaaran maanata he or koi karm ko hi dukh kaa nimitt samajhataa he
 Certain scholars consider nature and certain Gods to be the cause of sorrow
 atah he rajan! ab aap hi nishchit kijiye ki dukh kaa kaaran koun he
 " samraat parakshit us bail ke vachanon ko sun kar bole - "he vrishabh! aap avashya hi bail ke rup main dharm hai or yah gaurupini prithvi mata he
 You know the heart of religion very well
 aap kisi kii chugali nahin kar sakate isiliye aap dukh dene vaale kaa naam nahin bataa rahe hai
 o religion! Your tenacity, purity, mercy and truth were the four stages in the Satyuga
 treta main teen charan rah gayi, dwapar main do hi rah gayi or ab is dusht kaliyug ke kaaran aapkaa ek hi charan rah gaya he
 This unrighteous Kali Yuga is trying to destroy even that phase by its untruth
 bhagwaan shrikrishnachandra ke swadham gaman se dusht paapi shudra raja log is gaurupini prithvi ko bhogenge isi kaaran se yah mata bhi duhkhi hai
 " itnaa kah kar raja parikshith ne us paapi shudra rajveshadhari kaliyug ko maarane ke liye apni tikshn dhar vaali talwaar nikaali
 Kaliyug, fearful, took off his majestic dress and fell at the feet of King Parikshit and started saying tari-tahi
 raja parakshit bade sharnaagat vatsal the, unhone sharan main aaye huye kaliyug ko maarna uchit na samajha or kaliyug se kaha - "he kaliyug! tu mere sharan main aa gaya he isaliye maine tuje pranadan diya
 But only you are the root cause of wrongdoing, sin, lies, theft, treachery, poverty etc
 atah tu mere rajya se turant nikal ja or laut kar phir kabhi mat aana
 " raja parakshit ke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug ne kaatar vaani main kaha - "he rajan! aapkaa rajya to sampoorn prithvi par he, aapke rajya se baahar aisa koi bhi sthaan nahin he jahaan par ki main nivas kar sakun
 Hey Bhupathi! You are very kind, you have given me shelter
 ab dayaa karke mere nivas kaa bhi kuch na kuch prabandh aapako karnaa hi hoga
 " kaliyug is tarah kehane par raja parakshit soch main pad gayi
 After considering it, he said - "O Kali Yuga! Gaming, drinking, adultery and violence are inhabited by untruth, item, work and anger in these four places
 in chaar sthanon main nivas karne kii main tuje chhot detaa hoon
 "kali Yuga said this -" o Uttaranandan! These four places are insufficient for my residence
 dayaa karke koi or bhi sthaan mujhe dijiye
 "on asking for this kind of Kali Yuga, King Parikshit gave him the fifth place 'swarna'
 kaliyug in sthanon ke mil jane se pratyakshtah to vahaan se chalaa gaya kintu kuch dur jane ke baad adrushya rup main waapas aakar raja parakshit ke swarna mukut main nivas karne laga
 After this, he wandered a lot for the hunted prey and had a bad condition due to hunger and thirst
 shaam ke samay thake haare vah shamik rishi ke ashram pahunche rishi us samay brahamalin samaaghi main leen the 
 
 parikshit ne kaha ki hamen pyaas lagi he hamen pani chahie yahaan or koi bhi nahi he kya aap sun rahe he ham raja parikshit bol rahe he hamen pyaas lagi he hamen pani chahie aapako sunai nahi detaa kya rishi us samay samaaghi main brahamalin the raja ne do-teen baar pani maanga parantu rishi kii samaaghi nahi tuuti 
 
 rajmukut main baithe kalyug kii prarena se unki satvik buddhi bhrasht ho gai or unhone rishi ko dand dene kaa faisla kiya 
 But due to the good cremations of the king, he restrained himself from that sin
 krodh vash unhone mara hua saanp rishi ke gale main daal diya 
 The son of that Shamik Rishi, Shringiu was very strong and was bathing in the river at that time
 duusare rishi kumaro ne jaakar sara vritakan sunaaya 
 Hearing how a king has disowned his father, he became mad with anger and by filling the same river of river Shran with an anjuni, he cursed the king, the arrogant and foolish king who insulted my great father the same

 The word church is a corruption of the Greek adjective literally meaning "of the Lord"
 vastav main carch do arthon main prayukt he; ek to prabhu kaa bhawan arthath girjaghar tathaa doosraa, isaayiyon kaa sanghathan
 In addition to the church, the term 'congregation' also operates
 yah unani bible ke 'eklesia' shabd kaa vikrut rup he; bible main iskaa arth he - kisi sthanvishesh athwa vishwa bhar ke isaayiyon kaa samudaay
 Later this word started being used for the church as well
 yahan par sanstha ke arth main carch par vichaar kiya jaayga
 All Christians often agree that Jesus established only one church, but the unity of Christians could not remain intact for many reasons
 falswaroop aajkal unke bahut se carch athwa sanghathan vartmaan hai jo ek duusare se purnataya swatantra hai
 They can be classified as follows: isai dharm kii praarambhik shatabdiyon main carch kii paribhaasha tathaa uske swaroop ke vishay main apekshaakrit kam chintan kiya gaya he
 It is clear from the description of the biography and teachings of Jesus in the Bible that from the very beginning Christians believed that Christianity provided the means of salvation for all mankind and for this purpose established the "kingdom of God" on earth
 
 "ishwar kaa rajya" un logon kaa samudaay he jo isa ke ishwartv par vishwaas kar unki shiksha grahan karte hai
 In the Bible, that community is called "god to the people"
 uske sanghathan tathaa shashan ke liye isa ne 12 shishyon ko chunakar unhen vishesh shikshan tathaa adhikaar die or aadesh diya ki ve duniya bhar main jaakar unki shiksha kaa prachaar karen tathaa vishwaas karanevaalon ko baptism sanskaar karke carch main sammilit kar len
 Thus, in the Bible, the community of followers of Jesus is called the church, "the kingdom of God" and "the people of God"
 in padon se aisa prathit ho saktaa he ki prarambh main carch ke vaastavik rup ko bahari sanghathan tak simit mana gaya he, kintu aisi baat nahin he
 Jesus has emphasized in his teaching that there is invisible and mystical unity between him and his true followers
 unhone apane shishyon se kaha- "main draksha lata hoon or tum daaliyaan ho
 "this makes it clear that the most important element of the church is spiritual
 sant paulus ne carch ke is aadhyatmik tathaa rahasyatmak paksh par bahut bal diya he
 In his letters, he has repeatedly called the Church "the spiritual body of Christ" to illustrate the spiritual connection of Jesus and his true followers and the mysterious unity of all followers of Jesus
 at: prarambh hi se carch ke bahari sanghathan tathaa uske aadhyatmik swaroop, donaan kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 When the Church broke out due to Protestant religion, the religious people began to think more about the nature of the church
 protestant vidvan carch ke adrishy swaroop par or pratikriyaswaroop katholic dharmapandit carch ke bahari sanghathan, uski drishy sadsyta aadi par adhik bal dene lage
 In this controversy, he has given more importance to the four external characteristics of the church
 isa kaa sachcha carch katholic he ; ek he, prem ke bandhan main ek hokar uske sabhi sadsy ek se dharmasiddhanton par vishwaas karte hai
 One accepts the sacrament, the same worshiping ritual and the rule of the same goddess; Is holy; Has apposles carch ke drishy sanghathan main kuch aise log bhi sammilit ho sakate hai jo paakhandee hai, jinka isa ke saath koi aadhyatmik sambandh nahin he, jo isa ke aadhyatmik sharir ke ang nahin hai
 God only knows who is a true member of the church and for this reason it can be assumed that the real church is invisible
 phir bhi us adrishy vaastavik carch kii purna sadsyta kii anivaary shart bahari sanskaar hi hai, at: adrishy carch se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nowadays, almost all Protestants also believe this
 mukti ke liye carch kii purna sadsyta apekshit hote hue bhi anivaary nahin he
 God wants the salvation of all people and produces inspiration in the conscience of all human beings
 jo ishwar kii prerana par chalate hai ve anjaane hi adrishy rup se carch ke apurna sadsy ban jate hai or isa dwaara pradutt mukti praapt kar sakate hai
 After the Second World War, the movement for unity of the Church in the Christian world began to be given more importance
 falswaroop khandan-mandan ko chhodkar bible main vidyaman tatwon ke aadhaar par carch ke vaastavik rup ko nirdhaarit karne ke prayaas main isapar apekshaakrit adhik bal diya jane laga ki carch isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir he
 Jesus is its head and true Christians are parts of that body

 isa kii mrityu ke baad unke shishy yahudiyon tathaa gaiyr yahudiyon main isai dharm kaa prachaar karne lage
 The most successful of the first missionaries was Saint Paul; a description of his travels and his letters are preserved in the latter part of the Bible
 us samay antiok roman samrajya kaa teesraa shahar tha, is kaa uttaradhikari sant petrus yaheen chale aae or us centre se sant paulus ne asia miner, maasedonia tathaa yunaan main isai dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 Later the capital Rome became the principal center of Christianity
 vahiin sant petrus or sant paulus shahid ho gaye
 The latter half of the Bible was written in the late first century AD
 san 100 i

 By the end of the third century Christianity had spread to all the cities of the vast Roman Empire; At the same time many people in Persia and South Russia also became Christians
 is safalataa ke kai kaaran hai
 One, there was strong religion among the people at that time, secondly Christianity taught the importance of every human being, whether he was a slave or a woman
 iske atirikt isaayiyon main jo bhaatrubhaav tha usase log prabhavit hue bina nahin rah sake

 mahaar regiment bhartiya sena kaa ek infantry regiment he
 Although originally it was thought to combine the Mahar soldiers of Maharashtra, it is the only regiment of the Indian Army that is made up of soldiers from all communities and regions of India
 mahaar scouts or unki sena kile main sainikon ke rup main maratha raja shivaji dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 They were recruited by the East India Company Company in the sixth part of the Bombay Army to form a large part of the company
 bombay sena unki bahaduree or dhvaj ke prati vafadari ke liye mahaar sainikon isht or isliye bhi kyonki ve angl-maratha yuddh ke dauraan par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he
 They have achieved many successes, including in the Battle of Koregaon, where the Mahar-dominated company troops were defeated under the leadership of a much larger Peshwa Bajirao II
 yah ladaai ek obilisk, koregaanv stambh he, jo bhartiya swatantraaa jab tak mahaar regiment ke shikhar par chapa rup main janaa dwaara manaaya gaya
 The Mahar soldiers of the Bombay Army saw action in the [indian Revolt of 1857], and joined the two regiments
 The rebellion under the British war of this regiment is "bolo Hindustan ki Jai"
 vidroh ke baad bhartiya sena ke british adhikariyon, vishesh rup se jo pratham or dwitiya afgaan yuddh main seva kii thi, marshall daud siddhant ke liye mudra dene ke liye shuru kiya
 It was theorized that some Indians were naturally warlike between castes and communities, and more suited to war than others

 The final blow to the Mahar soldiers came in 1892 when it was decided to institute "class regiments" in the Indian Army
 maharon in varg regimenton main shaamil nahin the, or yah adhishuchet kiya gaya tha ki maharon, kuch anya virgon ke saath ke bich, ab bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye the
 The Mahar soldiers, who included 104 Viceroy commissioned officers and a host of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were demobilized
 is ghatana ko ek sarkari ve ek sau se adhik varshon ke liye kaam kiya tha dwaara apni vafadari kii ek vishwasghaat ke rup main maharon ne mana gaya tha
 After the demobilization of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 BR Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganization of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, B
 R
 Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col V
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer Mentioned in dispatches
 They also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Centre was established at Kamptee
 Following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 ramgarh naamak ek chote se gaanv main sevanivruth police adhikari thakur baldev singh do choron ko bulaata he, jinhen usne ek baar giraftaar kiya tha
 Thakur is sure that both of them - Jai and Viru - can help him in catching the notorious dacoit Gabbar Singh

 Gabbar's three companions come to Ramgarh to get food from the villagers, but because of Jai and Viru, they have to go empty-handed
 gabbar unke maatr do logon se haarane par bahut krodhit hota he or un tino ko maar daalata he
 He then attacks the village on Holi day and takes Jai and Viru hostage after a long fight
 thakur un donon kii madad karne kii sthiti main hote hue bhi unki madad nahin karata
 Jai and Veeru somehow escape, and angered by Thakur's inaction, they decide to leave the village
 tab thakur unhen bataata he ki kis tarah kuch varsh pehle usne gabbar ko giraftaar kiya tha par wo jail se bhaag gaya or phir pratishodh lene ke liye usne pehle to thakur ke puure parivaar ko maar daalaa, or phir thakur ke dono haath kaat diye
 Thakur used to cover it after wearing a shawl to hide it
 ramgarh main rahete huye jai or viru dhire dhire gaanv waalon ko pasand karne lage the
 Jai falls in love with Thakur's widow daughter-in-law Radha, and Veeru, who runs a tanga in the village
 isi bich jai-viru or gabbar ke bich choti-moti takaraaren hoti rahati hai, or ek din uske aadmi basanti or veeru ko pakad kar le jate hai
 Jai goes to save them, and the three of them escape
 is ladaai main jai ko goli lag jaati he, jisase uski mrityu ho jaati he
 Enraged by Jai's death, Veeru chases Gabbar alone and captures him
 donon ke bich hathapayee hoti he, jisamen viru gabbar ko maarane hi vaala hota he ki thakur vahaan aa jaataa he or gabbar ko jivit uske hawaale karne kaa jai kaa vaayada yaad dilaataa he
 Veeru hands over Gabbar to Thakur, who crushes Gabbar's hand with his pointed shoes and then hands him over to the police
 viru akelaa gaanv chhodkar railway stesan ke liye nikal jaataa he, jahaan basanti uskaa intazaar kar rahi hoti he
 Radha remains alone once again

 This included everything from his name to the manner of those people

 Some elements in the film's plot are drawn from other Indian films, such as Mera Gaon Mera Desh and Khote Sik

 sam pekinpa ke western, jaise da wild banch or pat getate and billy da kid, or jorge roy hill ke buch casidy or sundence kid ne bhi sholay ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The character Gabbar Singh was built on an actual bandit of the same name, who had terror in the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s
 asli gabbar singh jab kisi bhi pulicekarmi ko pakadta tha, to uske kaan or naak katkar use chhod detaa tha, taaki use anya pulicekarmiyon ke liye chetavanee ke rup main darshaya ja sake
 The character was also inspired by Ganga Jamna, where Dilip Kumar's character Ganga was a bandit who spoke a dialect composed of a mixture of Khadiboli and Awadhi, similar to Gabbar
 yah charitra sergio leone ke for e fu dollars mor ke khalanaayak "el indio" se bhi prabhavit tha
 Surma Bhopali, a minor character in the film, was based on a jungle officer named Surma of Bhopal, who was familiar to actor Jagdeep
 suurama ko aakhirkaar mukadmaa daayar karne kii dhamkee deni padi thi, jab film dekhne vaale logon ne unhen bhi ek lakadahare ke rup main sanderbhit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The makers of Sholay had initially chosen Danny Denzongpa for the role of Gabbar Singh, but they were not ready for the role, as he had already agreed to work in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma, whose filming time also included Sholay's
 Was the same
 nirmaataaon kii duusari pasand amjad khan the
 He agreed to play this character and started preparing for this character by reading a book called Abhishapt Chambal
 chambal ke dakaiton ke shoshan ke bare main bataati yah pustak unki saathi kalakaar jaya bhaduree ke pita tarun kumaar bhaduree ne likhi thi
 Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but salim-javed felt that "the audience was sympathetic to him because of his earlier roles; Gabbar had to be completely disgusted
" " Sippy wanted Jai to play Shatrughan Sinha, but many other big stars were working in the film, and so Sinha refused
 amitabh bachchan us samay itane prasiddh nahin hue the; unhen is kirdaar ko paane ke liye kathor parishram karnaa padaa tha
 salim-javed, however, recommended Bachchan's name for Sholay in 1973; Because salim-javed was convinced that Bachchan was the right actor for this film after seeing his acting in the film Zanjeer
 kyonki film ke kai sadasyon ne kathanak pehle hi pard liya tha, kai abhinayta alag alag kirdaar nibhaane hetu icchhuk the
 Pran was first cast for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy found Sanjeev Kumar better for the role
 saleem-javed ne bhi thakur ke charitra ke liye dilip kumaar se baat kii thi, lekin unhone us samay man kar diya; dilip kumaar ne baad main mana ki yah un kuch filmon main se ek thi jise chhodane par unhen khed tha
 Dharmendra was also interested in Thakur's character, but when he was told by Sippy that if he became Thakur, Sanjeev Kumar would be given the role of Veeru and then he would team up with Hema Malini
 film ke nirmaan ke dauraan chaar mukhya kirdaaron ke kaaran iske nirmaan main kaaphi samay lag gaya
 Four months before its filming started, Amitabh married Jaya

 Even during the courtship scenes of Dharmendra and Hema Malini, Dharmendra used to lose his hard work, and due to this he had to work many times for the same scene

 Most parts of Sholay were shot in the rocky areas of Ramnagar, a small town near Bangalore city in Karnataka
 film ke seton tak suvidhajanak pahunch sunishchit ke liye nirmaataaon ko bangalore rajmarg se ramnagar tak ek sadak banani padi thi
 An entire artificial city was built near the site by art director Ram Yedkar
 on-lokation set kii prakritik prakaash vyavastha se mail khaane ke liye, mumbai ke raajakmal studio ke paas bhi ek jail kaa set banaaya gaya tha
 Later, a part of Ramnagar was also renamed "sippy Nagar" in honor of the film's director
 2010 tak, "sholay chattaanon" kii ek yatra bhi ramnagar aane vaale paryatakon ke liye uplabdh thi
 Filming began on 3 October 1973, filming a scene of Bachchan and Bhaduri
 film kaa nirmaan apane samay ke liye bhavy tha; aksar kalakaaron ke liye partiyon or bhojon kaa aayojan hota rahata tha, or is kaaran iskaa bajet to badha hi, saathi hi ise puraa karne main dhai saal lag gaye
 One of the reasons for its high cost was that Sippy re-shot the scenes he had shot several times to get his desired effect
 geet "ye dosti" ke 5 minute ke geet anukram ko shoot karne main 21 din lag gaye, do chote drishy jisamen radha deepak jalaati he, prakaash kii samasyaon ke kaaran 20 dinon main filmaae ja sake, or ek drishy, jisamen gabbar imam ke bete kii hatya karata he, 19 dinon main jaakar shoot ho paaya
 The theft scene in the train, which was filmed near Panvel on the mumbai-pune railroad, was completed in more than 7 weeks
 sholay steriophonic soundtrack rakhane or 70 mimi widescreen praaroop kaa upyog karne vaali pehali bhartiya film thim
 However, real 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, so the film was first shot on traditional 35mm film, and the 4: 3 images made from it were later converted to 2
2: 1 frames
 is prakriya ke bare main sippi ne kaha, "ek 70 mimi praaroop badi screen kaa vaastavik anand detaa he or tasviir ko or bhi bada banane ke liye iskaa or adhik aavardhan karata he, lekin chunki main dhwani kaa bhi baraabar prasar chahta tha, to hamane 'chah trek-steriophonic' dhwani kaa prayog kiya or phir ise badi screen ke saath sanyukt kiya
