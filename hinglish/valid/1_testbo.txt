 In the rainy season, you can see mangoes in every house
 aam ko falon kaa raja isliye bhi kaha gaya he kyonki ise adhikansh log pasand karte hai or isamen poshak tatwon kii bhi bharpoor hote hai
 While mango keeps the digestive system fine, it is also effective for skin softness
 yahaan tak ki yah twachaa kaa rang saaf karne main bhi madadgaar sabit hota he
 But this mango with so many benefits is also harmful
 bhuulane lage hai choti-choti baat to rojaanaa khaaen santarisaliye aam khaane se pehle kuch baton ko jaan lenaa jaruri he

 In this case, know that mango is very hot fruit and excessive intake can cause boils and pimples on the face
 so aam limit main khaaie varanaa aam chehre kii rangath or chamak donon chura legaa

 daad, khaaj or khujali :yaad rakhen aam ke munh par chik yaa taral padaarth hota he jise yadi aapane thik se saaf nahin kiya yaa use baahar nahin nikaala to munh kaa swaad to bigaadega hi, balki munh par laga to unhen daad, khujali or dane par bhi laa saktaa he
 Apart from this, if it goes into the throat, it will not only cause a sore but can also cause both pain and swelling
 jo gathiya or sinus jaisi bimariyon ke shikaar hai, unhen to aam se thodi duuri avashya bana hi leni chahie
 In case of increased cardiac arrest, eat these 5 spices for healthy heart
 pet kharaab :dhyaan rakhen aam kuch rongon ko or zyada badha sakate hai
 Mango is directly related to your stomach
 yaad rakhen meetha, lajij or suswaadu aam jitna acha khaane main lagata he, utana hi ye pet kii haalat bhi kharaab kar saktaa he
 Eating more mango can lead to diseases like loose motion, stomach bloating
 kul milakar aam hajme ko bahut kharaab kar saktaa he
 5

 unhone kaha ki amarinder ne pradhanmantri ko bataaya ki punjab kaa goindwal sahib taap vidyut sanyantr antarrashtriya seemaa ke najadik sthit he or pakistan ko bijli kii aapurti karnaa kathin nahin hoga

 ) Fast bowler r Vinay Kumar's injury proved to be a boon for all-rounder Irfan Pathan, who was once offered as an alternative to Kapil Dev
 pathan ko srilanka daure ke liye antim kshanon main team main jagah mili or unhone vahaan balle or gend donon se behtareen pradarshan karke philhal bharat kii olerounder kii samasya kuch had tak sulajhaa di he
 Pathan batted well in five odis against Sri Lanka in odd moments
 iske alaava unhone kasi hui gendbaaji karke apane chayan ko bhi sahi tehraaya he
 The Baroda all-rounder scored 76 runs while being unbeaten three times in four innings, while also taking eight wickets

 Interestingly, Pathan was not selected in the first team for this series
 bhartiya team ke daure se kuch din pehle vinay kumaar chotil ho gaye or chayankartaaon ne unki jagah pathan ko chunaa tha
 This was the last chance for this all-rounder, as he did not impress the selectors when he returned after being out for almost three years
 pathan kaa ab srilanka main pradarshan isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki bharat kaa aage kaa kaarykram kaaphi vyast he or use har samay ek olerounder kii jarurat padegi
 Pathan's performance in the last match is important, as this is the fourth occasion in the last five years, while an Indian bowler took five wickets in a one-day match
 pathan bhi apane pradarshan se santusht hai
 He said, "thank God that in this entire series i bowled well and also made some useful runs
" pathan ko 2004 main pehali baar tej gendbaaj ke taur par team main chunaa gaya tha
 After that, he handled Indian bowling well
 is bich unhone apni ballebaaji se bhi prabhavit kiya tathaa kuch test maichon main to unase pari kaa aagaaj bhi karavaaya gaya
 When Greg Chappell was the coach, he told Pathan to focus more on batting
 tippaniyan Pathan always kept reiterating that he was the first bowler and then batsman, but after 2006 his bowling started to become ineffective, forcing him to struggle for a place in the playing XI
 pathan ne pichley saal disambar main vaapasi kii, lekin iske baad nirantar ek jaisaa pradarshan nahin kar paae
 He scored 100 runs in eight matches and took 13 wickets before the Sri Lanka tour from December, but he flopped badly in the Asia Cup played in Bangladesh, after which he was dropped from the team
 ab vah phir se lay main aa gaye hai or yadi vah is pradarshan ko barkaraar rakhte hai, to bharat ko olerounder kii samasya se nahin jujhna padegaa or captain mahendra singh dhoni ke paas adhik vikalp rahenge

 bhartiya team ke daure se kuch din pehle vinay kumaar chotil ho gaye or chayankartaaon ne unki jagah pathan ko chunaa tha
 This was the last chance for this all-rounder, as he did not impress the selectors when he returned after being out for almost three years
 pathan kaa ab srilanka main pradarshan isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki bharat kaa aage kaa kaarykram kaaphi vyast he or use har samay ek olerounder kii jarurat padegi
 Pathan's performance in the last match is important, as this is the fourth occasion in the last five years, while an Indian bowler took five wickets in a one-day match
 pathan bhi apane pradarshan se santusht hai
 He said, "thank God that in this entire series i bowled well and also made some useful runs
" pathan ko 2004 main pehali baar tej gendbaaj ke taur par team main chunaa gaya tha
 After that, he handled Indian bowling well
 is bich unhone apni ballebaaji se bhi prabhavit kiya tathaa kuch test maichon main to unase pari kaa aagaaj bhi karavaaya gaya
 When Greg Chappell was the coach, he told Pathan to focus more on batting
 tippaniyan Pathan always kept reiterating that he was the first bowler and then batsman, but after 2006 his bowling started to become ineffective, forcing him to struggle for a place in the playing XI
 pathan ne pichley saal disambar main vaapasi kii, lekin iske baad nirantar ek jaisaa pradarshan nahin kar paae
 He scored 100 runs in eight matches and took 13 wickets before the Sri Lanka tour from December, but he flopped badly in the Asia Cup played in Bangladesh, after which he was dropped from the team
 ab vah phir se lay main aa gaye hai or yadi vah is pradarshan ko barkaraar rakhte hai, to bharat ko olerounder kii samasya se nahin jujhna padegaa or captain mahendra singh dhoni ke paas adhik vikalp rahenge

 Pathan's performance in Sri Lanka is important now because India's forward schedule is very busy and he will need an all-rounder at all times
 pathan kaa aakhri match main pradarshan kaaphi myne rakhata he, kyonki pichley paanch saal main yah chauthaa avasar he, jabaki kisi bhartiya gendbaaj ne van-de match main paanch wicket liye
 Pathan is also satisfied with his performance
 unhone kaha, khuda kaa shukr he ki is puri shrunkhlaa main maine acchhee gendbaaji kii or kuch upyogi ran bhi banaae
 Pathan was selected for the first time in 2004 as a fast bowler in the team
 iske baad unhone bhartiya gendbaaji kaa jimmaa acchhee tarah sambhala
 In the meantime, he also impressed with his batting and in some Test matches, he was also introduced to the innings
 jab greg chapel coach the, to unhone pathan ko ballebaaji par adhik dhyaan dene ke liye kaha
 The comments pathan hameshaa doharaate rahe ki vah pehle gendbaaj hai or tab ballebaaj, lekin 2006 ke baad unki gendbaaji beasar hone lagi, jiske kaaran unhen antim ekadash main jagah banane ke liye sangharsh karnaa padaa
 Pathan made a comeback in December last year, but did not perform consistently after that
 unhone disambar se srilanka daure se pehle tak aath match main 100 ran banaae tathaa 13 wicket liye, lekin bangladesh main khele gaye asia cap main vah buree tarah flop rahe, jiske baad unhen team se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 Now he is back in rhythm and if he maintains this performance, India will not have to face the problem of all-rounder and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have more options
 pathan ko 2004 main pehali baar tej gendbaaj ke taur par team main chunaa gaya tha

 afghanistan ke raashtrapati hamid karaji ne kaha he ki taliban shashan ko ukhaad phenkane ke baad pichley 10 varsh main unki sarkaar or uttar atlantic sandhi sanghathan (nato) nagarikon ko suraksha dene main asafal rahi hai
 In an interview with the BBC on the completion of 10 years of the US attack in Afghanistan, Karzai accused Pakistan of helping terrorists
 unhone kaha ki pakistan main aatankwaadiyon ke jo panaahagaah hai unhen samaapt karne kii jarurat he
 He said that he will step down from the post of President in the year 2014 and he is working in this direction
 gyaat ho ki karaji kaa yah bayaan us samay aayaa he jab gathbandhan sena ke ek purv commander ne kaha he ki nato sena apane lakshyon ko hasil karne main kaaphi dur rahi he
 General Stanley mcchrystal, who retired after a decade of fighting in Afghanistan, said, "from a military standpoint, the Coalition Army has succeeded in achieving a little over half the target and the United States began the war with a very simple approach
 " karaji ne kaha ki nato, america or hamaare padosi pakistan ko bahut pehle hi varsh 2002-03 main taliban ke thikaanon par apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie tha
 a sister-in-law murdered her brother-in-law while sleeping in up's Rampur

 According to the information, one person was beaten to death with a stick while sleeping in his own house in Madhuri village of Thana Shahabad area

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal somvaar ko dharne par baithne vaale hai
 In the event of his demand not being met, he will sit with his ministers and mlas outside the central government home office
 ise bhale hi nae navele mukhyamantri kejariwal kii dharna politics kaa naam diya jaae lekin usase pehle unhone soshal media ko hathiyaar banaakar twitor politics khelnaa jarur shuru kar diya he
 Arvind Kejriwal has also fiercely attacked the Delhi Police and the Ministry of Home Affairs through Twitter
 apane dharne ko lekar kejariwal ne logon se apil tak kar daali he
 In view of the preparations for the Republic Day, i appeal to my supporters and people not to go on strike
 isame sirf emele hi shaamil honge isliye kripaya duusare log na aaen
 After appealing to the general public of Delhi, Chief Minister Kejriwal now comes to the issue of dharna of himself and his mlas
 unhone likhaa, ‘main apane mantriyon or apane vidhayakon ke saath grih mantralay ke daftar ke baahar dharne par baithunga
 We are all doing this for the safety of women in Delhi
 ’kejariwal ne dilli police or dilli police ke bahaane hi grih mantralay ke khilaaf khule khel kaa elaan kar diya he
 Through Twitter, he has also directly sought his opinion from the public
 unhone likhaa, ‘dilli main ek mahila jinda jalaai gai
 All but one accused are free
 sthaneey esechao ne unki giraftaar se inkaar kar diya he
 Shouldn't that SHO be punished? dilli main ek danish mahila kaa gangrape hota he to iske liye kya duty main laaparvaahee baratane vaale pulicekarmiyon ko doshi nahin tehraana chahie
 By listening to Kejriwal's Twitter War, it is easy to understand how the Aam Aadmi Party has become aware of the way the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Delhi Police under it function
 darasal is ladaai kaa asal mudda hi dilli police par adhikaar or varchasv kaa he jisaki lagaam philhal grih mantralay ke paas he
 On the one hand, to get rid of corruption, the country team is looking forward to Anna
 duusari ore sarkaar janata ke saamne baar-baar lokapal ke liye patibaddhta kii baat karti he, par ant samay main vah koi na koi siyaasi chaal chalati najar aati he
 This time too, the situation seems to be more or less the same
 lokapal vidheyak ko somvaar yaa mangalvaar ko sanshodhit rup main rajyasabha main pesh kiye jane kii sambhaavna he, jisamen lokayukta ke vivaadaaspad praavdhaan ko hataane ke saath hi sibiai pramukh kii niyukti main or paardarshita laana shaamil he
 There was much speculation that this could be discussed by the Cabinet on Thursday, but it did not happen
 sutron ne kaha ki rajyasabha main paarit hone ke baad ise baad main vaastavik manjuuri pradaan kii ja sakati he
 Discussion on the Lokpal Bill passed in the Lok Sabha last December was not completed in the Rajya Sabha during the winter session due to technical reasons
 kuch sutron kaa kahana he ki vidheyak somvaar ko rajyasabha main aa saktaa he jabaki kuch anya is baat par jor de rahe hai ki aisa mangalvaar tak ho saktaa he jo ki bajet satr kaa aakhri din hoga
 Minister of State for Personnel v Narayanasamy said, 'the government is committed to bring the bill in the current session
 ’ sarkaar or vipaksh is baat par sahamat he ki vidheyak se lokayukta praavdhaan ko hataa diya jaae or alag adarsh kanoon paarit kiya ja saktaa he jisamen rajyon ko apana bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon banane ke liye dishanirdesh kaa kaam karegaa
 According to the information, on the issue of removing the Lokpal, the government is close to the demand of the opposition that the government should not have all the rights
 madhyamaarg nikaalane ke prayaas jari hai jisamen sansad is maamle par faisla karegi or uske baad use ucchtam nyaayalay ko suchit karegi
 As far as bringing the ngos under the purview of the Lokpal is concerned, the government can agree on the suggestion of the opposition that only government-funded ngos should be brought under its purview
 vivaadaaspad lokapal vidheyak par sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich kuch daur ke vaartalap ke baad bhi sibiai ko or adhik swaittata dene tathaa lokapal kii niyukti or use hataane jaise mudde abhi gatirodh kaa vishay bane hue hai
 Government common on Lokpal Bill
 sahmati banane kii koshish main vipaksh ke netaaon se sampark saadhaa he or kuch muddon par unase baatcheet kii
 Government common on Lokpal Bill
 sahmati banane kii koshish main vipaksh ke netaaon se sampark saadhaa he or kuch muddon par unase baatcheet kii
 According to sources, while the opposition is stressing that the CBI can be made autonomous from outside the government's control, the government is not in favor of separating the agency
 kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal or sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali or makapa netaa seetaram yechuri se is mudde par guftgu kii
 Sources said the government is not in favor of making the CBI autonomous but is said to agree with the opposition's stand that the agency director should be appointed by a collegium
 vipaksh ne yah maang bhi kii ki lokapal kaa chunaav karne vaali ikai tatasth ho or usamen sarkaar kii maujuudagi or niyantran kam se kam ho

 (input bhashaa se) New picture of Charisma from Syria
 malbe se baahar nikali do saal kii bacchee
 The house was grounded in the bomb blast aasmaan se barase bam ne ghar ko kabr bana diya
 Inside the house that was transformed into a tomb, a child choked for hours
 tabhi kuch logon ke kaanon main is bachche ko rone kii aawaaj padi
 The charisma that happened after this was astonishing
 ye ghatana bagdadi ke ilaake syria kii he
 The 2-year-old girl, who came out of the debris, had turned her house into a grave in human tragedy
 par tabhi kabr ban chuke ghar ke ek hisse se ek bachche ke rone kii aawaaj aati he
 Part of the voice is excavated
 wo bhi haathon se
 So that the child does not get hurt
 or phir kudarat apana karishma kuch is tarah dikhaata he ki malbe se baahar nikalati he 2 saal kii bacchee
 Innocent mouth was trapped under tons of debris, innocent
 iesasaur virdohi guton ko sabak sikhaane ke liye shahar ke upar din-raat udaan bhartefiter jettskab, kahaan or kiske sir par bam barasaa den ye koi nahin jaanata, or sabase badi mushkil ye he ki bam begunaah or gunahagaaron kaa fark karnaa bhi nahin jaanate
 The sound of crying came from the debris, in such a way, from the wreckage of a house, people suddenly hear the cry of a girl
 eent, kancreet or sariyon ke saikadon ton malbe ke neeche se aisi kisi aawaaj kaa sunai dena bhi apane-aap main kisi karishme se kam nahin
 So, people start chasing that innocent voice without delay
 ye aawaaj kabhi tej hoti he or kabhi bilkul band ho jaati he
 But here the question is of a life, so people do not delay and start digging with hands exactly where this cry is coming from
 haathon se khudaai kar bacchee ko baahar nikaalascai to ye he ki upar se dekh kar sahi-sahi andaja lagaana bhi behad mushkil tha ki wo bacchee malbe ke dher main thik kis jagah par ho sakati he
 But then the effort continues
 or ek saath kai jode haath ret or mitti ke saath-saath kancreet ke baari-bharkam tukdon ko hataane lagate hai
 And after exactly one minute and forty seconds there is another charisma
 pehali baar malbe ke neeche se bacchee kaa haath dikhaai detii he
 The child is lying face down and is so caught up in the dust-mud that it is difficult for her to breathe even if she is moving
 lekin ye shaayad uuparavaale kii hi marji he ki itane mushkil halaat main fansi hone ke baavjood uske rone kii aawaaj malbe se baahar logon ko sunai de rahi thi
 The dust-laden girl came out and now digs and accelerates, and then the baby's head and other parts of the body also appear on the hand
 logon kii koshish he ki kisi tarah bacchee ko khinch kar sidhaa bitha liya jaae, taaki wo khul kar saans le sake, kyonki malbe main fansi bacchee ke aankh, naak, munh, kaan har jagah dhul hi dhul bhar chukaa he
 People soon succeed in directing the child
 lekin haath aaazaad hote hi wo donon haathon se besakhta apni ankhen malane lagati he
 Apparently, he has the most trouble because of the sand filled in the eyes
 pichley hafte hue IL&FS chrysis ke baad se hishere bazarasahamaa hua he
