 par jab ye tat ke paas aati hai, to laharon kaa nichalaa hissaa zamin ko chune lagata he,- inaki gati kam ho jaati he or oonchaai bad jaati he
 In such a situation, when they hit the coast, there is catastrophe
 gati 420 kilometre prati ghanta tak or oonchaai 10 se 18 meter tak
 That is, a running wall of saltwater

 When there is a very fast movement within the sea, a storm rises in it, causing a surge of long and very high waves that move with a strong impulse, these waves are called tsunamis
 darasal sunami japani shabd he jo su or nami se mil kar bana he su kaa arth he samudr tat auki nami kaa arth he lehren
 The first tsunami has also been taken as a rising tide in the sea, but it is not so
 darasal samudr main lehren chaand suraj or grahon ke gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav se uthati hai lekin sunami lehren in aam laharon se alag hoti hai
 The same thing happened on 11 / 03 / 2011 sunami laharon ke peeche vaise to kai kaaran hote hai lekin sabase zyada asardaar kaaran he bukamp
 iske alaava zamin dhansane, jwalamukhi fatne, kisi tarah kaa visphot hone or kabhi-kabhi ulkapaat ke asar se bhi sunami lehren uthati hai
 Whenever the upper layer of the sea suddenly moves forward due to a severe earthquake, the sea starts moving upwards in its parallel position
 jo lehren us vaqt banati hai wo sunami lehren hoti hai
 An example of this may be that the top layer of the earth is interlinked like the layers of football or that it is like an egg with cracks
 pehle sunami ko samudr main uthne vaale jowar ke rup main bhi liya jaataa rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he
 Actually, the moon flying in the sea rises under the influence of sun and planetary gravity, but tsunami waves are different from these common waves
 jaise andey kaa khol sakht hota he lekin uske bheetar kaa padaarth lizlija or geela hota he
 Due to the impact of the earthquake, these cracks widen and cause such a stir in the material inside that it quickly moves upwards
 dharti kii paraten bhi jab kisi bhi asar se chaudee hoti hai to wo khisakati hai jiske kaaran mahadweep banate hai
 So this way these tsunami waves are formed
 lekin ye bhi zaruri nahin ki har bukamp se sunami lehren bane
 For this, the center of the earthquake must be in or around the sea
 jab ye tsunami lehren kisi bhi mahadweep kii us parat ke uthle pani tak pahunchati hai jahaan se wo duusare mahadweep se judaa he or jo ki ek daraar ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 There the intensity of the tsunami wave decreases
 wo isliye kyon ki us jagah doosraa mahadweep bhi jud rahaa he or vahaan dharti kii judi hui parat kii vajah se daraar jaisi jo jagah hoti he wo pani ko apane andar rasta detii he
 But after that when the tsunami moves along the inner water towards the shore, it is so fast that it can rise up to 30 meters and whatever way trees, forests or buildings come in its way - can clear everything is
 sunami lehren samudri tat par bheeshan tareeke se hamalaa karti hai or jaan-maal kaa buree tarah nuqasaan kar sakati he
 These are difficult to predict
 jis tarah vaigyanik bukamp ke bare main bhavishya vaani nahin kar sakate vaise hi sunami ke bare main bhi andaaza nahin laga sakate
 But by looking at the record of the tsunami so far and the condition of the continents, scientists can make some guesses
 dharti kii jo plates yaa paraten jahaan-jahaan milti he vahaan ke aasapaas ke samudr main sunami kaa khatara zyaada hota he
 Like where the Australian layer and the Eurasian layer meet, there is Sumatra which is connected to the Philippine layer on the other side

 The PLC consists of investment / output devices, compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; a little electrical design is required and the design problem is focused on describing the desired sequence of operations
 PLC anuprayog aamtaur par atyadhik anukulit system hote hai isliye ek sankul PLC kii keemat ek vishisht anukulit rup se bane niyantrak dizine kii keemat kii tulana main kam hoti he
 On the other hand, in the case of surplus-produced materials, customized control systems are economical because of the low price of the components, which can be chosen optimally rather than as a "normal" solution and where non-recursive engineering costs thousands or millions of units
 Extends
 ucch maatra ke yaa bahut aasaan nirdhaarit swachaalan kaaryon ke liye vibhinn takneekon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For example, a consumer dishwasher would be controlled by an electro-mechanical chem timer, which would cost only a few dollars in production volume
 ek sookshmaniyantrak-aadhaarit dizin vahaan uchit hoga jahaan saikadon yaa hajaaron ikaiyaan utpann hongi or is tarah vikaas kii laagat kai vikrayon main failaai ja sakati he or jaha ant upyogkarta ko niyantran ko badalane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Automotive application is an example, millions of units are created each year and very few end users change the programming of these controllers
 haalanki, kuch vishesh parivahan jaise tronsit basen vishisht rup se dizine kiye niyantranon kii bajaay kifayati PLC kaa upyog karti hai, kyunki inaki maatra kam hoti he or vikaas kii laagat alabhakar hogi
 Very complex process controls, such as those used in the chemical industry, may require demonstration of algorithms and even beyond the capability of high-performance plcs
 bahut ucch gati yaa sateek niyantran ko bhi anukulit samaadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati hai, udhaaharan ke liye, vimaan udaan niyantran
 Programmable controllers are widely used in motion control, placement control and torque control
 kuch nirmaataa PLC ke saath sankalit karne ke liye gati niyantran ikaayiyon kaa utpaadan karte hai taaki G-code mashin kii gatividhiyon ko aadesh dene main istemaal kiya ja sake
 PLC may include logic, a "proportional, whole, derivatives" or "PID controller" for a single-variable feedback analog control loop
 jaise, ek PID loop ek vinirmaan prakriya ke taapmaana ko niyantrit karne main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Historically, plcs were generally configured with only a few analog control loops, where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, instead a distributed control system would be used
 As plcs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has become less clear
 PLC main sudur terminal ikaayiyon vaali saamaan kaaryakshmata he
 An RTU, however, generally does not support control algorithms or control loops
 As hardware becomes increasingly more powerful and cheaper, rtus plcs and dcss are increasingly beginning to take over responsibilities and many vendors are selling rtus with plc-like features and vice versa
 The industry has standardized the IEC 61131-3 functional block language to create programs running on rtus and plcs, although nearly all vendors also provide proprietary options and related development environments

 Discrete signals are sent using either voltage, or power, where a specific range is assigned as ON and the second OFF
 For example, a PLC may possibly use 24 v DC i / O, with values above 22 v DC indicating ON, values below 2VDC off, and intermediate values uncertain
 shuru main, PLC ke paas keval asatat i / o tha
 Analog signals are like volume controls, with a line of values between zero and full scale

 Because plcs typically use 16-bit symbolic binary processors, integer values are limited to between -32,768 and +32,767
 dabaav, taapmaana, pravaah or vajan aksar analog sanketon dwaara darshaae jate hai
 Analog signals can use a voltage or power of gravity proportional to the value of the process signal
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek analog 4-20 ma yaa 0 - 10 v nivesh 0 - 32767 ke ek purnank mulya main parivartit kiya jayega
 Current inputs are less sensitive than voltage inputs, with respect to electric noise
 udahaaran ke rup main, maan lo ek suvidha ko ek tanks main pani ikattha karne kii zarurat he
 When needed, water is drawn from the tank by another system and our example system is required to manage the water level of the tank
 keval digital sanketon kaa upyog karte hue, PLA ke paas flot switch se do digital nivesh hai 
 jab pani kaa str switch se upar hota he to vah ek sampark band kar detaa he or sanket ek nivesh ko bhej detaa he
 The PLC uses a digital output to open and close the entry valve in the tank
 jab pani kaa str kaaphi neeche ho jaataa he jisase neeche ke str kaa flot switch band ho jaye, tab PLC valve khol degaa taaki or pani andar aa jaye
 ek baar pani kaa str itnaa upar aa jaye taaki upar ke str kaa switch chaalu ho jaye, to PLC pani ko baahar bahane se rokane ke liye pravesh ko band kar degaa
 This staircase is an example of seal-in logic
 yah nirgam tab band rahata he jab tak koi paristhiti circuit ko tod nahin detii
 An analogous system can use a water tightness sensor or an adjustable adjustable dripping out of a heavy cell and a tank, the valve slowly adjusting the water back into the tank
 is system main 'fluter' samanjan, jo valve ko tod sakate hai, unhen rokane ke liye, PLC "haisatarasis" ko sammilit karti hai, jo multah gatividhi kaa ek "deadband" banaata he
 If a technician adjusts this deadband, the valve moves only for a significant change in rate
 yah badale main valve kii gati ko kam karata he, jisase isaki ragad kam ho jaati he
 a real system can combine both approaches, using float switches and simple valves to prevent spillage and a rate sensor and rate valve to optimize the refill rate and prevent water hammer
