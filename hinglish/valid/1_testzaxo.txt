 Therefore, i give a boon that you will have sixty thousand sons of a queen, but there will be only one child who runs your dynasty from another queen

 "with the passage of time, Shaivya gave birth to a very handsome son named Asmanj and a tumbi was born from Vaidarbhi's womb, which sixty thousand sons were born

 Anshuman said that i am Please return our horse and tell us some way of salvation of our grandfathers
 kapil muni ne ghoda lautaate huye kaha ki vatsa! jab tumhaare dadaon kaa uddhaar keval ganga ke jal se tarpan karne par hi ho saktaa he
 "anshuman brought the horse of the sacrificial fire and completed the Ashwamedha yagna of Sagar

 Dilip's son's name was Bhagiratha
 bhageerath ke bade hone par dilip ne bhi apane purvajon kaa anugaman kiya kintu ganga ko laane main unhen bhi asafalataa hi haath ai
 "finally Ganga was pleased with Bhagirath's penance and asked him to ask for a boon
 bhageerath ne haath jodakar kaha ki mata! mere saath hajaar purakhon ke uddhaar hetu aap prithvi par avatarit hone kii krupa karen
 On this, Ganga said that Watts! i will come to the earth by obeying you, but no one else can bear my velocity except God Shankar
 isaliye tum pehle shankar bhagwaan ko prasann karo
 Hearing this, Bhagiratha did severe austerities to Lord Shankar and pleased with his austerity, Shiva stood on the top of the Himalayas to stop the flow of the Ganges
 ganga ji swarg se sidhe shiv ji kii jataaon par ja giriin
 After this, Bhagiratha brought Ganga ji back and forth to the ashes of her ancestors, which saved her

 The word cow dung is often used to refer to cow, ox, buffalo or buffalo feces
 ghaas, bhusa, khali aadi jo kuch choupayon dwaara khaaya jaataa he uske pachan main kitne hi rasinic parivartan hote hai tathaa jo padaarth apchit rah jate hai ve sharir ke anya apdravyon ke saath gobar ke rup main baahar nikal jate hai
 It is usually moist, semi-solid, but it also changes according to the animal's food
 keval hari ghaas yaa adhik khali par nirbhar rahanevaale pashuon kaa gobar patala hota he
 Its color is somewhat yellow and thick brown
 isamen ghaas, bhuse, ann ke daanon ke tukade aadi vidyaman rahete hai or saralata se pahachaane ja sakate hai
 On drying it turns into a hard mass
 gobar main upasthit padaarth evam gun kai baton par nirbhar karte hai, jaise pashu kii jati, avasthaa, chaara, dincharya aadi
 The dung of grazing or working animals is different from those that are tied in one place
 doodh pinevaale bacchon yaa bachhawon kaa gobar manushyon ke mel se kuch kuch miltaa julata he
 The dung of the animals with more straw and less oil is less in nitrogenous and fat and more like cellulose, but in the case of the cattle of high-calorie, the dung is more nitrogenous and fat in contrast
 gaayon ke gobar main bhi bachche ke pet main aane kii avasthaa se lekar doodh dene kii avasthaa tak parivartan hote rahete hai
 The young animal digests about 70 percent of the food in the body, but only 25 percent of the cow milking
 shesh gobar ev mutr main nikal jaataa he
 The grains of grain are often present in dung in its original state; But broken, or ground, parts of the grain are affected by digestion
 iske atirikt kuch drav bhi gobar main rahata he
 This fluid is said to be disinfectant
 gaay ke gobar main 86 pratishat tak drav paaya jaataa he
 The quantity of minerals in cow dung is also not reduced
 isamen phosphorus, nitrogen, chuunaa, potash, manganeez, loha, silicon, aluminium, gandhak aadi kuch adhik maatra main vidyaman rahete hai tathaa iodine, coblt, molibdinum aadi bhi thodi thodi maatra main rahete hai
 Astu, in the form of cow dung manure, due to most of the minerals, makes the soil fertile

 mitti ke sampark main aane se gobar ke vibhinn tatv mitti ke kanon ko aapas main bandhate hai, kintu agar ye kan ek duusare ke atyadhik sameep yaa jude hote hai to ve tatv unhen dur dur kar dete hai, jisase mitti main hawa kaa pravesh hota he or paudhon kii jaden saralata se usamen saans le paati hai
 The proper benefit of cow dung can be found only by using it as fertilizer
 jaisaa abhi kaha gaya he, gobar kaa sabase laabhprad upyog khaad ke rup main hi ho saktaa he, kintu bharat main jalaane kii lakadiyon kaa abhaav hone se iskaa adhik upyog eendhan ke rup main hi hota he
 For fuel, its cowherds or condes are made and dried
 sookhe gohare achche jalte hai or unpar bana bhojan, madhur aanch par pakane ke kaaran, swaadisht hota he
 But the proper and beneficial use of cow dung, as has been said, is only in the form of manure
 sabhi samrudh deshon main, jahaan kahin gobar denevaale pashu hote hai, gobar se khaad bana lee jaati he or usase khet upjau banaae jate hai
 Earlier two methods of composting of cow dung were prevalent in India, but a third method is also being practiced now
 ye vidhiyaan nimnlikhit hai: For this, appropriately sized, 20-25 feet long, 5-6 feet wide and 3 to 10 feet deep, are dug and dung is filled in them
 bharte samay use is prakaar dabaate hai ki koi jagah khaali na rah jaae
 The upper part of the fabric is made like a dome and is coated with cow dung, so that the unnecessary water of the rainy season does not enter it
 tatpashchaat lagbhag teen maheene tak khaad ko banane ke liye chhod dete hai
 In this method, the temperature of the fabric never goes above 34 degrees, because the chemical activity in the fabric is limited due to lack of air
 is vidhi main nitrogenyukt padaarth khaad se nikalne nahin pate
 In this method, a thin fold of dung is pressed without pressing
 hawa kii upasthiti main rasinic parivartan hote hai, jisase taap 60 degree sein
 tak pahunch jaataa he
 The fold is then pressed and a second thin fold is put on it to allow the temperature to rise
 is prakaar dher das se bees foot tak unchaa ban jaataa he, jo kuch maheenon ke liye isi avasthaa main chhod diya jaataa he
 In this way, the special benefit is that the seeds of grass, coarse and other harmful plants, which can be present in cow dung, are destroyed when the temperature increases
 prayek pashu se is prakaar 5 se 6 ton khaad ban sakati he
 This method, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Center, uses a simple device that digests the dung in the absence of air
 is vidhi se ek prakaar kii gas nikalati he, jo prakaash karne, yantra chalaane tathaa bhojan pakaane ke liye eendhan ke rup main kaam aati he
 The cow dung is mixed with water and put in a digestive device every day and takes the above work from the gas released
 is vidhi kii visheshta yah he ki gobar sadakar gandhhin khaad ke rup main praapt ho jaataa he or iske nitrogen, phosphorus, potash aadi aise upyogi tatv bina nasht hue isi main surakshit rah jate hai
 Along with this, useful gas is also available
 anumaan he ki ek gram parivaar, jisamen 4-5 pashu hai, lagbhag 70-75 ghan foot jalane vaali gas prati din taiyaar kar saktaa he
 The amount of dung in India and the annual production of nitrogen phosphorus and potash present in it are as follows: kintu gobar kaa bahut thodaa bhaag hi khaad ke rup main prayukt ho paata he
 For this reason, the production of this country is very less in proportion to other countries
 jalaavan ke rup main gobar kaa upyog ek bahumoolya khaad ko nasht karnaa he
 To destroy
 jahaan tak ho gobar ko khaad ke liye hi kaam main laana chahie

 There are cracks on this surface but the striking craters are very few
 daraaron main bhi nai barf se bhari hui lagatee hai
 Looking at the surface, many scientists think that there will be a sea of water beneath it
 unki soch he ke jab bhi sataha kisi ulkapind ke girane se fatati he yaa usamen brihaspati ke jowarbhata bal kii kheenchaatani se daraaren padati hai, to neeche se sagar ke pani se sampark rakhane vaali garm barf upar aa jaati he or sakhti se jamkar ghaav bhar detaa he
 If there is indeed such an ocean then it is possible that life is flourishing in it

 Scientists also estimate that Europa's hard snow surface has turned 80 ° since its formation billions of years ago
 is se yah shankaa or teevr hoti he kii satahi barf kaa khol ek pani ke gole ke upar tair rahaa he or aaraam se hill-dul saktaa he
 Other scientists say that there is no such sea and that there is only soft ice beneath the hard ice outside - but scientists who believe so are few

 This sea will have more than twice the water of all the seas of the earth

 uske alaava ek aisa bhi prastaav he ke ek yaan ko europa par utaara jaae
 The vehicle will have a heat-generating part of the nuclear power that will melt the surface ice and sink into Europe until it either enters the ocean or proves that there is no such sea 
 kyonki vaigyanik maanate hai ke upree barf kii sataha 10 kimi se adhik moti he isliye is yaan ko samudr tak pahunchne ke liye bahut gaharaai tak dhansana hoga
 It will also be necessary to have enough broadcast power so that even under such depth of snow, it can send messages and pictures
 is yaan main aisi qabaliyat bhi hogi ki vah swayan hi samudr main ghumta rahe or apni disha chun sake kyonki prithvi se us tak nirdesh pahunchne main kuch minute lagenge

 Gallic struggled for its existence until the 17th century and after becoming independent, Eyre considered it his national language
 phir bhi lagbhag chaar sau varshon tak irevasiyon ne jis videshi madhyam se apane ko vyakt kiya he vah paitruk daay ke rup main unki apni rashtriya sampatti he
 Much of this is of the sort that he has become an inseparable part of English literature and has influenced English literature, but there is very little in which Eyre's own heartbeat is not heard
 is sahitya ke lekhakon main hamen teen prakaar ke log milte hai : ek ve jo england se jaakar ir main bas gaye par ve apane sanskaar se puure angrej bane rahe, duusare ve jo ir se aakar england main bas gaye or jinhone apane rashtriya sanskaron ko bhuulakar angreji sanskaron ko apana liya, tisare ve jo mulat: chaahe angrej hon chaahe yri, par jinhone ir kii aatma se apane ko ekatm karke sahityarachana kii
 It is mainly the people of this third category who give the specialty to english-aiyari literature, that despite the unity of the language, it is given a separate place in English literature

 Rambha means to speak in the voice of a buffalo
 In Sanskrit it also means shining or delightful

 In the first sense it can be called buffalo but in the second sense it is beautiful

 iluminaati ek aisa naam he jo kai samoohon, donon aitihaasik or aadhunik or donon vaastavik or kaalpanik ko sanderbhit karata he
 Historically, it specifically refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret committee established on 1 May 1776
 aadhunik samay main yah ek kathith shadyantrapurn sanghathan ko sanderbhit karne ke liye bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, jo "singhaasana ke peeche ek aspasht shakti" ke rup main kaary karata he, kathith rup se vartmaan sarkaron or nigamon ke madhyam se duniya ke maamalon ko niyantrit karte hue, aamtaur par bavarian iluminaati ke ek aadhunik avatar ke rup main
 is prakaran main, iluminaati aksar ek nai vishwa vyavastha ke sandarbh main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many intrigue theorists believe that the Illuminati are the planners behind the events that will promote the establishment of the new world order

 us samay ke lekhakon, jaise seth pesan, kaa maananaa tha ki, andolan europea rajyon kii sarkaron ko ghuspaith or ukhaad phenkane kii sajeesh darshata tha
 Some authors, such as Augustine Baruel and John Robinson, even claimed that Illuminati was behind the French Revolution, a claim that jean-joseph Moonier wrote in his 1801 book, 'on the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, free-mansions, and to the Illuminati on Rejected in The Revolution of France
 samooh ke anuyaayiyon ko "iluminaati" naam diya gaya, haalanki ve khud ko "perfectabilists" bulaate the
 The group is also called the Illuminati Order and the Bavarian Illuminati, and the movement itself is referred to as Illuminatism

 He was a supporter of enlightened dictatorship and in 1784 his government banned all secret societies including Illuminati

 The members of the Illuminati gave a promise of obedience to their superiors and were divided into three main classes, each with several degrees

 lekhak jaise mark dise,david ike, rayaan bark, juri leena or morgan greecer, kaa kahana he ki bavarian iluminaati sambhawatah is din tak jivit he
 Many of these theories propose that the events of the world are being controlled and manipulated by a secret committee calling itself the Illuminati
 saazish siddhantkaron ne daawa kiya he ki winston churchill, bush parivaar, baraak obama, rothschild parivaar, david rockfilor or zbiganiyeff brajinsky sahit kai pramukh log iluminaati ke sadsy the yaa hai
 In addition to the obscure and clandestine organization, many modern fraternal groups claim to be the 'heirs' of the Bavarian Illuminati and have openly used the Illuminati name in establishing their own scriptural work
 kuch, jaise ki ekaadhik samooh jo swayan ko "iluminaati aadesh" par kuch raddobadal kehete hai, apane sanghathan ke naam main is naam kaa sidhaa upyog karte hai, jabaki anya jaise ordo templi orients, is naam ko apane sanghathan ke andar pravartan kii ek shrenee ke rup main upyog karte hai

 Surveys refer to the artistic science by which accurate measurements of points on the surface of the earth can be made, by plotting them on a scale, to get accurate knowledge of their relative horizontal and vertical distances on paper or other medium
 is prakaar kaa ankit madhyam lekhachitr yaa maanchitr kehalaata he
 Both the linear and angular measurements are required for the completion and success of such a drafting action
 siddhantat: aalekhan kriya ke liye rekhik maap kaa hona hi paryaapt he
 But it is often impossible to obtain linear measurements directly on high fractal land, or is so complex that its accuracy becomes questionable
 aise kshetron main koniya maap raikhik maap ke sahaayak ang ban jate hai or ganitiya vidhiyon se agyaat raikhik maap gyaat karnaa sambhav kar dete hai
 Thus the survey involves three tasks - surveykshan kriya kii utpatti kii kahani adikaal se aaj tak ke maanav samaaj ke vikaas kii kahani, pradhanat: sukh or samruddhi ke liye bhraman or bhoomi par prabhusatta kii prapti se, judi hui he
 It was necessary to know the distances and directions between places for the excursion, and to know the boundaries and area for sovereignty
 aisa gyaan hone ke pramaan pracheen granthon main rajyon ke vistaar, dishaao ke vivaran or duuri ke liye yojana aadi ke ullekh se milte hai
 In ancient times, before the use of rocks, bhojpatra, tampatra and paper, the distance between places, the knowledge of identifying directions and the limits of authority would be inscribed on the memorial of human
 yuddh or kalah kaa bhay utpann hone par, us smriti or liye gaye maapon ko kisi madhyam par pradarshit karne kii kriya kaa janm hua hoga, jise baad main surveykshan kii sangya di gai
 Thus, due to the deep connection between human ambitions and survey, the survey process continued to progress
 aise prayaason kaa sabase pracheen pramaan isa se 370 varsh purv kaa mila he, jo turine ke ajaayabaghar main aaj bhi surakshit he
 Ancient articles of survey on rocks and wooden planks have also been found in Greece and Egypt

 They used tools such as today to mark the roads, survey plates and inscribed sticks to measure the other

 In Kautilya's Arthashastra and Banabhatta's Harshacharit there are references to the measurement of land etc
 in relation to the determination of revenue

 On Vasco da Gama's arrival in India in 1498, a Gujarati Pandit presented him with a sketch of the beach
 isse vidit hota he ki sabhyataa ke maarg par bade hue sabhi deshon main surveykshan kaa mahatv nirantar badhata rahaa or krishi, rajasav, bhoomi ke adhikaar kii simaaon ke nirdhaaran or yatraaon main margon ke lekhachitr banane main surveykshan kaa abhyaas evam prayog hota rahaa he
 But by the end of the 16th century, the importance of surveying increased hopefully

 There was competition among them in occupying the land, which gave new vigor and speed to the survey operations

 is kaaran surveykshan main itani nai-nai khojein hui ki unke aadhaar par surveykshankriya hi do pramukh virgon main bant gai : Geometric survey and patt surveykshan
 The main basis of this classification is the size of the earth
 jis surveykshan main prithvi ke aakaar ko golabh maanakar, uski sataha par liye gaye naapon kaa prayog karne se pehle prithvi kii vakrata ke liye shodhan karte hai, use bhuganitiya surveykshan kehete hai
 This is a difficult process
 magar prithvi kii gol yaa vakr sataha par naapi dooriyaan yadi adhik lambii na hon, to unhen vakr na maanakar ruju hi maan liya jaae, to koi vishesh truti nahin hogi
 For example, measuring an 11
5 mile long line on the curved surface of the Earth would cause an error of only 0
05 feet due to Earth
 isi prakaar prithvi kii sataha par kinhin bhi teen binduon dwaara 75 varg mile kshetrafal ke tribhuj ko samtal sataha par sidhi rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaae, to uske konon ke yoga or usee tribhuj kii vakr sataha par bane konon ke yoga main keval ek second kaa antar hoga
 For this reason, if maps of small areas are drawn, then displaying the measurements taken on the surface of the earth on the ground in straight lines will not cause a knocking mistake
 isliye prithvi ke chote kshetra ko samtal maanakar, us par lee gai naapon ko bina vakrata ke shodhan ke kisi paimaane par samtal kaagaj par ankit kar diya jaataa he
 This type of survey is called Patta survey
 saamaanya vyavhaar main aanevaale surveykshan samatleey surveykshan hi hote hai
 There is also some difference in the process of survey, equipment, scale etc
 for the accomplishment of different purposes
 in kaarnon se patt surveykshan ke bhi kai varg ban gaye hai : If maps of such a wide country or continent as India can be compiled with such planar surveys, the importance of board surveys increases over time
 yah tabhi sambhav hoga, jab patt surveykshanon kii aadharshila bhuganitiya surveykshan par ho
 The foundation stone will be eligible only when it is briefly explained
 surveykshan ko bhinn-bhinn aadhaaron ke anusaar adholikhit prakaar se vargeekrut kiya jaataa hai- These principles are very simple
 prithvi kii sataha par badi saralata se do aise bindu chune ja sakate hai jo ek duusare kii sthiti se dekhen ja saken or unke bich kii duuri naapi ja sake
 They can be placed on any desired scale on paper in such a way that the survey of their immediate area can be covered on paper
 iske baad in do binduon se kisi bhi tisare bindu kii duuri naapakar usee paimaane se kaagaj par uski saapeksh sthiti ankit kar sakate hai
 In this way, a map of the entire area can be made by taking the distance from any two points to a third unknown point and marking it sequentially
 duusare shabdon main, surveykshan kii vidhi tribhuj kii rachana he
 Above, only one composition of the triangle is mentioned, in which the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are known
 tribhuj kii anya rachana vidhiyaan bhi surveykshan main prayukt hoti hai
 See the basic principles of the detailed article survey
 thik bhugolic sthiti main bhu akruti ke roopankan ke liye maanchitr ke kshetra ke andar aise pramukh niyantran binduon ke jaal ke pratham aavashyaktaa he jinke greenvich ke saapeksh sahi sahi akshansh or deshaantar athwa ausat samudratal se oonchaai gyaat ho
 The Great Trigonometric Survey has done this in the making of most maps of India
 saar rup main yah chauras bhoomi par invaar dhaatu ke taar yaa feete se saavdhaanee se naapi hui lagbhag 10 mile lambii jameen hoti he jise 'aadhaar' kehete hai
 After the foundation is established, a series of triangles of appropriate arms and angles are carved one after the other
 tribhujon ke konon kaa nirikshan kar bhujaa tathaa binduon ke niamakon kii gananaa kar lee jaati he
 This is called a triangular survey
 tribhujon kaa jaal surveykshan main sarvatra failaa hota he
 The main device is the arc arc theodolite, which has the ability to accurately read vertical and horizontal angles by a fraction of a second or less
 ye bindu kaaphi dur dur hote hai
 Therefore, detailed survey is not possible
 iske liye yah aavashyak he ki mahan trikoshmetiya surveykshan ke bade tribhujon ko todakar chote chote tribhujon kaa jaal banaakar sari jameen ko kuch mile ke antar par sthit binduon kii maala main parinat kar diya jaae
 The projection is made on the desired scale
 prakshep main niyantran bindu ankit kiye jate hai

 In the last 30 years, the most effective method of entry in the field of survey is the method of aerial photograph
 sainik or asainik upyogita kii drushti se hawaii photography kaa mahatv pratham vishwayuddh kaal main hi anubhav kiya jane laga tha tathaa surveykshan or maanchitr nirmaankarya main iskaa upyog sarvapratham 1916 i

 Since then, astonishing progress has been made in this direction in European countries and North America
 ab to hawaii photography yaa photography dwaara surveykshan ek anuthi vaigyanik pravidhi he
 There are two methods of survey by aerial photograph: graphical and mechanics
 bharat main lekhachitreey vidhi kaa kuch varshon se atyaadhik upyog ho rahaa he or jahaan tak sthalakritiya maanchitr ankan kaa prashn he, yah vidhi lagbhag purnataa praapt kar chuki he
 Its basic principle is that the radiation lines in real vertical aerial photographs, which extend to the ground point in the photograph, form true and constant angles
 akritiyon kaa ucchata visthaapan maanchitr ke samtal main drushti bindu se thik neeche sthit ek bindu se kehete hai or jo vyavhaar main vaastavik urdhwadhar photo kaa centre mana jaataa he) areey hote hai jisase vivaran, maanchitr samtal ke baahar uski uchaai or avlamb bindu se duuri ke thik anupaat main vaastavik maanchitr sthiti se visthapit ho jaataa he
 After obtaining the desired face photo, it is displaced from the actual map position in exactly the same proportion by triangulation
 abhisht shakl photo praapt kar lene ke baad trikonkaran dwaara nishchit ninyatran binduon kii sahaayta or photo ke areey gun kaa upyog kar prakshipt patron par, jinka zikr ho chukaa he, thik bhugolic sthiti main photo ke centre ankit kiye jate hai
 The intersection of various details is determined by using the invariant properties of each photo to determine their correct position
 lekhachitreey vidhi kii sabase badi samasya photo se parishuddh ucchata gyaat karnaa he
 Due to this difficulty, a dense network of complementary high-altitude control is often created in land survey methods
 is maardarshak ucchataaon kii sahaayta se trivimdarshi ke neeche rakhkar photo par samocch rekhaayen khinchakar unhen maanchitr patr par laga diya jaataa he
 The above graphical method does not create an inaccurate map due to the absence of the vertical of the camera at the time of exposure
 yantric sankalan trivim aalekhan upkaran main hota he jisase photo thik usee sthiti main ulatate, jhukate or gum jate hai jisamen udbhasana ke samay vimaan tha
 These devices fix air-conditioning problems while accounting methods present approximate solutions

 It is expected that these changes have sufficiently weakened the algorithm to allow the agency to eavesdrop when needed, as well as speculation that an important tool - the so-called s-box - would include a "burglar" Changes were made for and that a reduction in the length of the original key would have enabled the NSA to discover the DES key using huge computing power
 Since then it has been observed that the S-box in DES is particularly flexible towards differential cipher analysis, a technique that was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s, but was known to the IBM, DES team

 In late 2009, the NSA reclassified the information, stating that NSA worked with IBM to strengthen algorithms against all but the rest of the coercive force attacks and replacement tables called S-boxes
 In contrast, NSA tried to persuade IBM to reduce the key length from 64 to 48 bits

 unke pita ek ejeeniyar or celsman the
 His mother was Pauline Einstein
 haalaanki oinstin ko shuru-shuru main bolne main kathinaayee hoti thi, lekin ve padhai main awwal the
 His mother tongue was German and later he also learned Italian and English

 In 1894, his father's company could not get a contract to supply for electric lighting in the city of Munich
 jiske kaaran huye nuksaan se unhen apni company bechni pad gai
 In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, where they first settled in Milan and then a few months later in the city of Pavia

 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "

 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means

 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem

 The count of Shodash Shringar appears to be unknown in ancient Sanskrit literature
 anumaanatah yah gananaa vallabhdev kii subhashitawali main pratham baar aati he
 According to him they are as follows- arthath majjan, cheer, haar, tilak, anjan, kundal, nasamukta, keshavinyas, cholii, noopur, angaraag, kankan, charanraag, karadhani, tambul tathaa kardarpan 
 Again this list of Shringar in Sri Rupgoswami's bright 16th century is counted as follows- ukt pramaan se shringaaron kii yah suchi banati he— arthath snaan, nasa mukta, asit pat, kati sutara, venivinyas, karnavatans, angon kaa charchit karnaa, pushpamaal, haath main camel, kesh main phool khonsnaa, tambul, chibuk kaa kasturi se chithran, kaajal, sharir par patrawali, makribhang aadi kaa chithran, alaktak or tilak
 Here the variation is evident in the list of Vallabhdev's and Sri Rupagoswami's period
 hindi kaviyon main jaaysi ke anusaar ye shringaar yon hai— majjan, snaan, vastra, patrawali, sindur, tilak, kundal, anjan, adharon kaa rangana, tambul, kusumgandh, capolon par til, haar, kanchuki, chhudraghantica ore paayal
 Acharya Keshavdas of Reetikavya has also calculated sixteen adornments as follows- ukt chand kii tikaa karte hue sardaar kavi ne ye shringaar yon gine hai— ubtan, snaan, amal patt, jaavak, veni goonthna, maang main sindur, lalaat main khor, capolon main til, ang main kesar lepan, menhadi, pushpabhushan, svarnabhushan, mukhwas danta manjan, tambul or kaajal
 It is clear here that the commentator has added several tools on his behalf
 nagendranath vasu ne hindi vishwakosh main in shringaaron ko gananaa nimnlikhit di he— ubtan, snaan, vastradharan, kesh prashaadhan, kaajal, sindur se maang bharna, mahavar, tilak, chibuk par til, menhadi, sugandh lagaana, aabhushan, pushpamaal, missi lagaana, tambul or adharon ko rangana
 The above various lists show that there is no definite definition or list to Shodash Shringar

 Jaitley recalled that Arun Jaitley, a minister in the Dinmodi government, was also a prisoner of MISA
 Recalling those days, Jaitley wrote, 'I had the distinction of organizing the only protest on the morning of 26 June 1975 and i became the first Satyagrahi against the Emergency
 i did not feel that at the age of 22 i was involved in the events that were going to be a part of history
 This incident changed the future of my life
 By evening, i was locked up as a MISA prisoner in Tihar Jail
 'with the imposition of the Emergency, a list of people who were to be arrested was made
 The first names in this list were Jayaprakash Narayan and Morarji Desai
 Indira's younger son Sanjay Gandhi was entrusted with the task of preparing this list
 JP and Morarji Desai were put in jail under MISA before dawn
 The story of Daman continued for the next 21 months
 The opposition prisoners who were ready in the jail did suffer torture in the jails but these prisoners also started to evict the Indira government from power
 From JP, leaders like Chandrashekhar, Vajpayee, George Fernandes, Lalu Yadav, LK Advani, Sharad Yadav ousted the Indira government from power as soon as they came out of jail
 The battle of opposition leaders reached a decisive point
 The Janata Party was formed under Morarji Desai and the first non-congress government was formed in 1977
 Indira herself lost the election to Rae Bareli and the Congress was reduced to 153 seats
 With the formation of the new government, the oppressive law MISA was removed
 Pension to MISA detainees Even during the Emergency, the government of non-congress states used to give pension to the people who were closed in MISA
 In Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP governments started giving pension of 15,000 rupees to prisoners held in DRI and MISA
 After this, in 2014, Vasundhara Raje government of Rajasthan also decided to give a pension of Rs 12 thousand per month to 800 MISA prisoners
 BJP still honors MISA prisoners throughout the country on the anniversary of the Emergency

 ankara garh kii neenv ek pramukh lava par galatins dwaara rakhi gai thi, or baaki roman dwaara puraa kiya gaya tha| Spyware is a type of malware that is installed on a computer and collects information about users in their non-information
 spiware kii upasthiti aamtaur par upyogkartaaon se chhipi hoti he
 Typically, spyware is secretly installed on users' personal computers
 haalanki, kabhi kabhi, keelogers jaise spiware saajha, korporate, yaa saarvajanik computer ke maalik dwaara bhi install kiye jate hai taaki gupt rup se anya upyogkartaaon kii nigaraanee kii ja sake
 The term spyware suggests that it is a software that secretly monitors a user's computer, while the work of spyware is much more than mere surveillance
 spiware vibhinn prakaar kii vyaktigat jaankaree ikattha karata he, jaise ki internet surfing kii aadaten or jin citon par jaaya jaataa he
 However, spyware can also interfere with the control of a user's computer by installing additional software and other methods such as redirecting the web browser
 spiware ko computer sthaapan ko badalane ke liye janaa he, jisase conection kii gati, alag-alag hompej kii gati or / yaa internet or / yaa anya prograamon kii kaaryakshmata dhimi ho jaati he
 In an effort to develop an understanding of spyware, a formal classification of the software types included under the name privacy-invasive Software has been created
 spiware ke aavirbhaav ke pratikriyaswaroop, anti-spiware software banane kaa ek laghu udyog shuru ho gaya he
 Running anti-spyware software has become a widely recognized element of computer security practices for computers, particularly those that use Microsoft Windows
 upyogkartaaon ke computer par niyantran sthapit karne ke liye gupt rup se software install karne ko rokane ke liye anti-spiware anek kanoon banaaye gaye
 US federal business income to reduce the risk of spyware infection Commission has placed a suggestion page for consumers on the Internet, which also lists "what to do" and "what not to do"
 shabd adware aksar kisi bhi software ke liye prayukt hota he jo vigyaapan pradarshit karata he jiske liye upyogkarta ne bhale hi sahmati di ho yaa na di ho
 eudora mail jaise kaarykram ke graahak shairwayre panjikaran shulk ke ek vikalp ke rup main apane vigyaapan pradarshit karte hai
 These are classified as "adware" in terms of ad-supported software, not as spyware
 Adware in this form does not work secretly or mislead the user and provides a specific service to the user
 adhikansh adware alag arth main "vigyaapan samarthit software" hone ke bajaae spiware hote hai, ek alag vajah se: upyogkartaaon par jasusi se hasil jaankaree ke aadhaar par hi sambandhit vigyaapan pradarshit kiye jate hai
 Examples are Clare Corporation's Gator Software and Bargainbuddy of Eject Advertising
 websiton kii saiyr main aksar rahanevaale graahak kii mashiinon par gupt rup se gator santhaapit kar diya jaataa he or uske baad yah santhaapit site kii or rajasav ko nirdeshit kar detaa he or cleria upyogkarta ke liye vigyaapan pradarshit karata he
 Users start receiving many pop-up advertisements
 upyogkarta dwaara websiton ko dekhne kii prishthbhumi main honevaali reporting spiware kaa anya vyavhaar he
 Data is used for "targeted" advertising effects
 spiware ke prasar se anya kaaryakramon ko bhi andeh kii najar se dekha jane laga he jo yahaan tak ki sankhyikeey yaa anusandhan prayojanon ke liye bhi web browzing trek karte hai
 Some observers found that an Internet Explorer plug-in published by Amazon
com called Alexa Toolbar as spyware and that some programs such as the]) report were anti-spyware
 adware vitaran kii in companiyon ko karodon dollar paidaa karanevaale rajasav kaa samarthan praapt he
 Adware and spyware are similar in terms of viruses, both of which are considered malicious by nature
 gumraah karanevaale adware ke jariye log munafa kama rahe hai, jaise ki antiveyras 2009 jo scareware ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Similarly, a bundle of free software from ad-supported programs such as P2P acts as a spyware, yet people are ready to download it
 isse anti-spiware utpaadon ke maalikon ko duvidha kaa saamana karnaa padataa he kyonki unke nishkasit karanevaale upkaran anjaane main icchit kaarykram ko niskriy kar sakate hai
 For example, recent test results showed that software bundles were bypassed by the popular anti-spyware program ad-aware, as it is part of the popular edonkey client
 To overcome this dilemma, the anti-spyware Alliance began to build a consensus within the anti-spyware industry about which software behavior is acceptable and which is not
 apane lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye, spiware-virdohi companiyon ke is samooh, shikshavidon or upabhokta samoohon ne samuhik rup se spiware kii paribhaasha, jokhim model or sarvottam abhyaas sahit dastavejon kii ek shrinkhalaa prakashit kii he
 Unlike viruses and worms, spyware is usually not self-replicating
 baharhaal, haal ke kai virus, spiware dizin ke dwaara vyavsaayik laabh ke liye sankramit computer ko kaam main lagaate hai
 Unsolicited advertisements appear to adopt specific strategies for monitoring personal information theft, web browsing activities for marketing, and routing of HTTP to advertising sites
 haalanki spiware ko ek pelod ke rup main varm dwaara choda ja saktaa he
 Spyware does not spread directly to a computer in the form of a virus or worm: usually the infected system does not attempt to transmit to another computer
 iske bajaay, spiware upyogkarta kii kamajoriyon ke madhyam se yaa soptware kii bhedyata ke dohan ke madhyam se pranali par haaavee hota he
 Most spyware is installed without user knowledge
 chunki ve spiware ke install ke prati chaukas rahete hai, kyonki agar ve jaanate hai ki yah unke kaam ke maahaul main khalal paidaa karegaa or unki gopneeyata se samjhauta karnaa hoga, spiware vaanchit software jaise ki kaja kii peeth par savaar hokar yaa chaalaaki se unhen sthapit kar upyokartaaon ko jhansa detaa he
 Some "rogue" spyware programs pretend to be security software
 aamtaur par spiware ke vitarak program ko upyogi upadeyata ke rup main prastut karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye "web gativarddhak" ke rup main yaa ek madadgaar software agent ke rup main
 upyogkarta turant shaq kiye bager ki ye nuksaan kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, software downlod or install karte hai
 For example, Bonji Buddy, a program that bundles spyware and targets children, claims: vah aapke bahut hi najadik mitra or sahaayak ke rup aapke saath internet kaa dhundhega ! vah bol, chal, thitholi, braoose, khoj, i-mail or downlod kar saktaa he jo aapke kisi duusare mitra ne kabhi naa kiya ho! usamen aap jo chaahate hai us utpaadon kii keemat kii tulana karne kii yogyata he or vah paise bachaane main aapaki madad karata he
 ! And the best part is that it is free
 spiware software ke anya bandal ke saath bhi aa sakate hai
 The user downloads a program and installs it and the installer installs additional spyware
 haalanki vaanchhneeya software khud koi nuksaan nahin kar sakate, lekin iske saath daale gaye spiware kar sakate hai
 In some cases, spyware makers pay shareware creators to insert spyware along with their software
 anya maamalon main, spiware nirmaataa install karanevaale jo ki sleepstream spiware he, ke saath vaanchhneeya freevare ko nai shakl dete hai
 Some spyware makers infect the system through security clues in web browsers or other software
 jab spiware nirmaataa ke dwaara niyantrit kisi web pej kaa upyogkarta maarg nirdesan karata he, pej main nihit code broujar par hamalaa kar detaa he or spiware ko downlod or install kiye jane ke liye baadhya karata he
 The spyware manufacturer has extensive knowledge of commercially available anti-virus and firewall software
 yah "downlod dwaara chaalit" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo hamale main upyogkartaaon ko asahaay darshak bana kar chhod detaa he
 The common browser exploits Internet Explorer and xxrep 4 ] by targeting security flaws
 spiware ko install kiye jane par yah lagaataar internet explorer ko shaamil karata he
