bhashaa-sambandhi is adhyayan ko europe main aaj tak anek naamon or sangyaaon se abhihit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Firstly this study was added a word as an adjective next to the word Philology - then it was called as "comparative Philology"
 unnisvin shatabdi tak vyakaran tathaa bhashaa-vishyak adhyayan ko praayah ek hi samajha jaataa tha
 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'
 france main isko langistik naam diya gaya
 The name "linguistique" or "linguistics" has been prevalent in the whole of Europe in the nineteenth century due to the greater language related work in France
 iske atirikt 'science of language', ‘glautoleji’ aadi anya naam bhi is vishay ko prakat karne ke liye kaam main aaye
 Of all these names, "linguistics", "philology" are used only today
 bharatvarsh main in sabhi europea naamon ke atirikt hindi bhashaa main jo naam prayog main laae jate hai ve is prakaar hai- ‘‘bhashaa-shaastra’’, ‘‘bhashaa-tatva’’, ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’, tathaa ‘‘tulanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan’’ aadi
 Among all these names, the most common name is "linguistics"
 in naam main pracheen or naveen sabhi naamon kaa samaahaar-sa hua jaan padataa he
 Therefore, this name seems to be suitable for this scripture
 apane vartmaan swaroop main bhashaa vigyaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke mastishk kii dein kaha jaataa he
 The trend of language-related studies is found in Sanskrit literature since very ancient times
 ‘shiksha’ naamak vedang main bhashaa sambandhi sookshm charchaa uplabdh hoti he
 Detailed description of the pronunciation of the sounds - elements, location, effort etc
 is available in these texts
 ‘praatishakhya’ evam nirukt main shabdon kii vyutpatti, dhaatu, upsarg-pratyay aadi vishyon par vaigyanik vishleshan bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kaha ja saktaa he
 Under Bhartrihari's book 'sentence Pad', subtle, deep and comprehensive thinking of the form of 'word' is available
 vahaan shabd ko ‘brahm’ ke rup main pariklpit kiya gaya he or uski ‘akshar’ sangya bataai gai he
 It is, by default, a language-related book
 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‘shabd’ ’arth’, ‘ras’ ‘bhav’ ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai’ sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‘‘bhashaa’’ tathaa ‘‘vigyaan’’
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‘bhashaa’ shabd sanskrit kii ‘‘bhash’’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‘vigyaan’ shabd main ‘vi’ upsarg tathaa ‘gya’ dhaatu se ‘lut’ pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakavi Dandi has written in his great book 'kavyadarsha' informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‘avyakt vaak’ kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‘vyakt vaak’ nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‘vyakt vaak’ kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‘vyakt vaak’ kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‘yadrichhik’ sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1
 apni chir-parichit bhashaa ke vishay main jigyaasa kii tripti yaa shankaaon kaa nirmulan
 2
 Introduction to historical and prehistoric culture
 3
 kisi jati yaa sampoorn maanavtaa ke maansik vikaas kaa parichay
 4
 Solution of many problems related to the meaning, pronunciation and use of ancient literature
 5
 vishwa ke liye ek bhashaa kaa vikaas
 6
 Assistance in learning foreign languages
 7
 anuwaad karne vaali tathaa swayan tip karne vaali evam isi prakaar kii mashiinon ke vikaas or nirmaan main sahaayta
 8
 Assistance in change in terms of simplicity, correctness etc
 in language, script etc
 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that is found as a divine gift to humans
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When the subjects of linguistics were included under the syllabus of large classes, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that the values that remain for art in a period, new changes are present in the future and they should be accepted in other countries also, it is not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 One of the great features of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been done for the classical subjects like sociology, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be called as inappropriate from any point of view
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- “jis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‘uun namah siddham’ kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‘padmavat’ ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‘somalata’ shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs — buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
 katyayan evam patanjali bhi isi koti main aate hai
 Among Greek scholars, Thrax, Discolus and Erodean also did notable work in this area
 panini se purna prabhavit hokar bluemfield ne san 1932 i
 main 'language' naamak apana granth prakashit karwaakar varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati dwaara do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon kii tulana kii jaati he
 It can also be called a mixed method, because the basis of both the descriptive method and the historical method is taken
 vivaran ke liye kisi ek kaal ko nishchit karnaa hota he or tulana ke liye kam-se-kam do bhashaaon kii apeksha hoti he
 Thus, comparative method can be called the sum of descriptive method and historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati kinhin do bhashaaon par lagu ho sakati he
 For example, comparison is also done in Indian languages - Bhojpuri etc
 Or comparative study of hindi-english, hindi-russian, hindi-persian is also done
 arthath isamen kshetragat seemaa nahin he
 Scholars like William Jones, France Bopp, Maxmüller, Curtius, August Schlikher, have made significant contributions to the development of comparative linguistics
 par, abtak tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan main un siddhanton kii badi kami he, jinke aadhaar par do bhinn bhashaaon kaa vargeekaran vaigyanik nahin ban sakaa
 The structural method is the sequel to the descriptive method
 america main is paddati kaa vishesh prachaar ho rahaa he
 In this, mechanical devices are being given more importance, which will facilitate special translation
 jalig haris ne 'methaids in strectural lingusticks ' naamak pustak likhakar is paddati ko viksit kiya
 Linguistics, like other branches of science, has experimental aspects, which require systems of experimentation and laboratory
 bhinn-bhinn yantric prayogon ke dwaara uccharnatmak swanvigyaan, bhautik swanvigyaan or shravnatmak swanvigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is also called experimental phonology, mechanical phonology or laboratory phonology
 isamen darpan jaise saamaanya upkaran se lekar jatiltam vaidyut upkarnon kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 As a result, full cooperation of mathematicians, physicists and engineers in the field of linguistics is expected
 kritrim taalu or kritrim taalu projector kii sahaayta se vyaktivishesh ke dwaara uccharit swanon ke uccharan sthaan kii pariksha kii jaati he
 The Kayamograph is useful for determining the resonance and life of the swans to know the resonance and timelines
 laringo scope se swaryantr kii sthiti kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The endoscope is an improved form of laryngoscope
 osilograph kii tarangen swanon ke bhautik swaroop ko parde par yaa film par atyant spashtataa se ankit kar detii he
 The same work is done more successfully by spectographs or sonographs
 spectograph jo chitra prastut karata he unhen pattern plabac dwaara phir se suna ja saktaa he
 Recorded material can be heard at a slow speed with the help of speechstretcher
 inke atirikt or bhi chote bade yantra hai, jinase bhashavaigyanik adhyayan main paryaapt sahaayta lee ja rahi he
 Among French linguists, Ruio wrote a treatise about the use of phonology
 landan main pro farth ne vishesh taluyantr kaa vikaas kiya
 For the measurement of vowels, as the lines of the vowel point or the quadrilateral are set, they form the basis lines for the measurement of consonants, by which the utterances can be described exactly
 danniel jans or ida ward ne bhi angreji swanvigyaan par mahatvapurn kaary kiya he
 Armstrong, Bethel and Boyanus are the main speakers of French, German and Russian languages
 saidhantik or praayogic swanvigyaan par samaan rup se kaam karanevaale vyaktiyon main nimnlikhit mukhya hai: stateson, negus potter, green or cop, martin zeus, hefnar, maul aadi
 a new mechanical effort has started here, which is related to vocabulary, semantics and grammatical forms
 yantric anuwaad ke liye vaindyut computaron kaa upyog vaigyanik yug kii ek vishesh dein he
 It is a very interesting and useful subject of applied linguistics

 In mathematics, the highest and lowest value of a function is called the highest and lowest of that function
 ucchisht or nimnisht ko sammilit rup se charam kehete hai
 They can be in a limited area of high and low function or in the entire domain of that function
 falan ke kisi simit kshetra main sthit ucchisht or nimnisht ko 'sthaneey charam' kehete hai jabaki falan ke sampoorn domen main falan kaa jo sabase adhik / kam maan ho use 'global charam' kehete hai
 Low and local peak values are shown in the side diagram
 isse adhik vyapak rup se kahen to, kisi samucchy kaa ucchisht or nimnisht, us samucchy ke sadasyon main sabase adhik or sabase kam maan vaale sadsy hote hai
 The objective of optimization is to extract the peak values of the functions
 ham nimnlikhit falan par vichaar karte hai First of all, we find the first derivative of this function and keep it equal to zero and find the possible high / low
 is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki x = 0 par ucchisht / nimnisht he, ham is x=0 par is falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan nikaalte hai or dekhte hai ki donon binduon par dwitiya avkalaj dhanatmak he yaa rinatmak
 Take the following function iskaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai: The second derivative of the function is: pratham avkalaj ko shunya rakhane par x kaa maan nimnlikhit miltaa he- x 1 = 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {1} = { \ sqrt { \ frac {1} {2 xxrep 5 } The value of the second derivative of the function is negative, so x = x_1 has this function specified
 isi prakaar ham dekhte hai ki x 2 = − 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_{2}=-{ \ sqrt { \ frac {1}{2 xxrep 4 } par falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan dhanatmak he, atah x_2 par falan kaa nimnisht he
 Consider the following function whose graph is given below- sabase pehle ham is falan kaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai or usko shunya ke baraabar rakhkar sambhavit ucchisht / nimnisht kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To make sure that x = 0 is superimposed on / low, we assume the second derivative of this function at x = 0 and see if it is positive or negative
 atah ham nishkarsh nikaalte hai ki is falan kaa koi na ucchisht he na koi nimnisht

enlightenedperl
org / Usail is a village in Pithoragarh district of Kumaon division under the state of Uttarakhand in Devalathal tehsil of India
 pratibhuti bazaar kii badalati jaruraton or pratibhuti bazaar main hone vaale vikaas ke prati pratikriya vyakt karne kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye 1995, 1999 or 2002 main bhartiya pratibhuti evam vinimay board adhinium 1992 ko sanshodhit kiya gaya
 Based on the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 2 December 2002, the Act was amended to address some of the gaps in the provisions of the SEBI Act
 sebi kaa lakshya bharat ko duniya kaa ek behtareen pratibhuti bazaar or sebi ko duniya kaa ek sabase sammanit niamak bananaa he
 SEBI also seeks to achieve the standards of IOSCO / FSAP
 is prishthbhumi main, varisht adhikariyon se milakar bane sebi dwaara gathit aatanrik samooh ne sebi adhinium main kuch sanshodhan kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 The SEBI Board constituted an expert group headed by Justice Shri H
H
 Kania to consider these proposals
 is visheshgy samooh kii report main die gaye sujhaavon par saarvajanik tippanee praapt karne ke liye ise pesh kiya gaya he
 It should be noted that this report does not necessarily reflect the views of SEBI on various proposals and suggestions
 un sujhaavon par koi antim nirnay lene se pehle sebi vibhinn sroton se praapt tippaniyon par vichaar karegi
 The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have established a criterion called the Financial Services Assessment Program to strengthen the financial systems monitoring system in the context of the imf's bilateral vigil and the World Bank's financial sector development work
 ethesaypi kaa nirmaan deshon ko sankat or seemaa-paar prabhaav se apane bachaav main vruddhi karne or vittiya pranali kii sudridhtaa or vittiya kshetra kii vividhta ko badhaava dekar vikaas main teji laane main unki madad karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 SEBI aims to make India one of the best securities markets in the world and SEBI as one of the most respected regulators in the world
 sebi ioessio / ethesaypi ke maanakon ko praapt karne ke liye prayasarat he
 There will be a need to amend the securities law and especially the SEBI Act which will facilitate India and SEBI to achieve the above objective
 yah is prishthbhumi main he ki sebi board ne samay-samay par sebi dwaara gathit anya visheshgy samoohon ke sujhaavon ke rup main bhi jepisi ke sujhaavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sebi adhinium ke maujuuda praavdhaanon kii kamiyon / visangatiyon kii pahchaan karne or sebi adhinium ko adhik prabhavi or niveshak anukool banane ke liye is adhinium main shaamil kiye ja sakane vaale nae praavdhaanon kaa suzav dene ke liye bhi ek visheshgy samooh kaa gathan karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 In its meeting held on 5 August 2004, the SEBI board formed an expert group consisting of the following members: samooh dwaara kiye jane vaale vichaar-vimarsh kii ek aadhaar saamagree ke rup main sebi adhinium ko sanshodhit karne ke liye kuch sujhaavon vaala ek shodh patr taiyaar kiya gaya
 The letter was sent to those representatives for obtaining comments from representatives of all stakeholders and market participants on the said letter and additional suggestions related to amendments to the SEBI Act
 jin hitdharakon se is par apni tippanee dene ke liye kaha gaya tha un hitdharakon ke naam iske anulgnak 'e' main diya gaya he
 The group received detailed comments from some stakeholders on the provisions, whose names are given in its Annexure 'B'
 samooh ne 27 oktober 2004, 20 disambar 2004, 4 farvari 2005, 10 march 2005, 11 april 2005, 3 may 2005, 14 june 2005 or 15 june 2005 ko yojit vibhinn baithkon main sebi adhinium ke sansodhano se sambandhit sujhaavon par hitdharakon se praapt tippaniyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is adhinium ke sansodhan se jude prastaavon par vichaar-vimarsh kiya
 I) Proposal to amend the SEBI Act to include new provisions
 II) Proposal to amend to amend existing provisions
 III) Proposal to make consequential and related amendments to other Acts
 '' pehla bhaag ' SEBI has been created, among other things, to protect the interests of investors investing in securities
 pratibhuti bazaar main uplabdh niveshon ke vibhinn vikalpon or sadhano se judi jatiltaaon kii drushti se niveshak shiksha adhik praasangik he
 Retail investors are not in a position to identify and / or appreciate risk factors associated with certain shares or schemes
 jiske parinamswaroop ve gyaat nivesh nirnay lene main sakasham nahin hai
 Since the development of securities market depends to a large extent on proper education of investors, SEBI is committed to spread awareness among them
 2001 ke pratibhuti ghotaale par sanyukt sansadeey samiti kaa suzav tha ki niveshak shiksha or jaagrukta abhiyaan ko sucharu rup se chalaane main sebi ko sakasham banane ke liye, company adhinium kii dhara 205si ke tahat sthapit niveshak shiksha evam sangrakshan kosh or arabiai ke niveshak shiksha sansadhano ko sebi ko pradaan kar dena chahie or sebi ke netritv main niveshak shiksha or jaagrukta ke liye ek sanyukt abhiyaan shuru kiya janaa chahie
 The group said that most of the stakeholders agreed to set up a separate investor protection fund under the SEBI Act
 hitdharakon kii taraf se bhi yah suzav mila he ki kathith kosh ko khaas taur par niveshak shiksha ke prayojan, jaagrukta kaarykram kaa aayojan or niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye istemaal kiya janaa chahie
 The group also said that the proposed Investor Protection Fund is to fulfill the objective of investor education and awareness
 company adhinium kii dhara 55e kii drushti se sebi ko puunji ke vitaran, pratibhutiyon ke sthanantaran or soochibaddh companiyon or stock exange main apni pratibhutiyon ko soochibaddh karaane kii ichha rakhane vaali companiyon ke maamle main labhaansh ke gaiyr bhugtan ke sambandh main dhara 55e main vinirdeshit anubhaagon ke praavdhaanon ko prabhaav main laane kii jarurat he
 In addition, SEBI needs to implement measures to protect the interests of investors and address investor grievances by listed companies
 uparokt praavdhaanon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue samooh ne niveshak sangrakshan ke uddeshy se niveshkon ke liye muaavje ke bhugtan se sambandhit prastaav par bhi charchaa kii
 In this regard, the group also discussed the suggestion of setting up a fund similar to the Fair Fund established under the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002 of the United States to compensate investors from the amount received as a penalty
 vichaar vimarsh ke dauraan ek anya vichaar bhi rakhaa gaya ki equity bazaar ke niveshak jokhim puunji main nivesh karte hai or kanoon ke tahat har ummid kii gaiyr purti ke liye koi aashwasit pratifal yaa muaavja nahin diya ja saktaa he
 However compensation related to fraud or misrepresentation or false statements made by companies or middlemen can be considered
 iske alaava samooh ne kaha ki pension fund yojanaon ke graahakon ke hiton kii raksha karne ke liye pension fund regulatory and deveopment othority ko anivaary banane vaale pension fund regulatory and deveopment othority adhyadesh 2004 ke tahat piefardie ko sabsakribar ajukeshan and protection fund kii sthapana karne kii anumati pradaan kii gai he
 The said ordinance also specifies the money that should be deposited in the alleged Subscriber Education and Protection Fund
 kathith adhyadesh ke praavdhaan ke mutabik adhyadesh ke tahat piefardie dwaara dand swarup vasuuli gai sabhi raashiyon ko sabsakribar ajukeshan and protection fund main jamaa kiya jayega
 The group felt that a separate fund could be set up under the SEBI Act, like the Subscriber Education and Protection Fund under the PFRDA Ordinance 2004, to be operated by SEBI to achieve the goal of investor protection by investor education and investor awareness
 And can be operated by SEBI for investor education and awareness
 iske alaava companiyon yaa bichauliyon dwaara kii gai dhokhadhadi yaa galatabayani yaa jhuthe bayanon ke sambandh main chote niveshkon kii kshatipurti ko kathith niveshak sangrakshan kosh ke baahar niveshak sangrakshan kaa ek vishay mana ja saktaa he
 In this regard, it may seem desirable that SEBI may specify guidelines and criteria for the operation of Investor Protection Fund for the purpose of payment of compensation to small investors and for the purpose of investor education and awareness
 is sambandh main, stock exange ke niveshak sangrakshan kosh ke sambandh main sebi dwaara jari dishanirdeshon ko aavashyak parivartanon ke saath apanaaya ja saktaa he
 Regarding the money to be deposited in the alleged Investor Protection Fund, the group noted the representation of the National Stock Exchange that large stock exchanges are using the money appropriately to meet the stated objective
 samooh ne yah bhi kaha ki chote stock exenjon ke ipief main pade hue paison kaa purna santosh ke saath istemaal nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 It is believed that the funds lying unutilized in the Investor Protection Fund of the stock exchanges for a long time should be transferred to the proposed Investor Protection Fund
 7 saal se adhik samay tak mutual fund or samuhik nivesh yojanaon yaa udhyam puunji koshon main pade hue laavaaris labhaansh or byaaj or bichauliyon ke paas pade hue graahakon ke laavaaris paison yaa pratibhutiyon kaa istemaal ek uddeshypurna tareeke se kiya janaa chahie
 Further, all the amounts recovered through penalty imposed by the Adjudicating Officer under Chapter VIA of SEBI Act should be deposited in the proposed Investor Protection Fund
 samooh ke suzav ke mutabik niveshak shiksha evam jaagrukta ke uddeshy se or companiyon yaa bichauliyon dwaara kii jane vaali dhokhadhadi yaa galatabayani yaa jhuthe bayanon ke sambandh main chote niveshkon kii kshatipurti ke liye piefardie adhyadesh 2004 ke tahat graahak shiksha evam sangrakshan kosh kii tarah sebi adhinium ke tahat ek alag niveshak sangrakshan kosh kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 The said fund should be operated by SEBI to protect investors, as per the guidelines related to stock exchanges, as per the guidelines established by SEBI or set norms to measure investor education and awareness and to compensate small investors
 kathith kosh main jamaa kii jane vaali rashiyaan is prakaar hai:-a) 7 saal se adhik samay tak mutual fund or samuhik nivesh yojanaon yaa udhyam puunji kosh yojana main padaa hua laavaaris labhaansh yaa byaaj;b) 7 saal se adhik samay tak pratibhuti bazaar ke kisi bichauliye ke paas padaa hua kisi graahak kaa koi laavaaris paisa yaa pratibhuti;c) stock exenjon ke niveshak sangrakshan koshon main aprayukt pade hue paise;d) sebi adhinium ke adhyay viie ke tahat maudrik dand ke rup main vasuul kii gai sabhi rashiyaan

3 Nomination Facility The concept of nomination has been recognized under Section 109 of Companies Act 1956, Section 45ZA of Banking Regulation Act 1949 and Section 39A of UTI Act 1963
 purvokt praavdhaanon ke tahat shairdharak yaa dibenture dharak, jamakarta yaa unit dharak kaa ummidavaar vasiyat ke kanoon sahit lagu anya kisi bhi kanoon main shaamil hone ke baavjood anya sabhi vyaktiyon ko chhodkar mritak kii pratibhutiyon yaa paison kaa haqadaar hota he
 However, there is no provision in the SEBI Act for such nomination facility for unit holders of mutual funds and collective investment schemes
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi vinium 1996 main unit dharakon ke liye namakan suvidha kaa praavdhaan he
 The group felt that the provision of nomination facility is favorable for investors, but such provision should be in the original act and not in the regulations
 haalanki samooh aisa koi adhibhavi prabhaav pradaan karne ke paksh main nahin he jaisaa ki company adhinium 1956 kii dhara 109 ke tahat pradaan kiya jaataa he jahaan ummidavaar kaa adhikaar kanoonee vaaris ke daawey ko maat de saktaa he
 In view of the above facts, the Group recommends making suitable amendments to the SEBI Act to include a provision to provide nomination facility to unit holders of mutual funds and collective investment schemes
 samooh ko suchit kiya gaya ki sebi ko sebi adhinium evam viniyamon ke praavdhaanon kii vyakhya par agrim maargdarshan ke liye vibhinn bazaar pratibhaagiyon se anginat anurodh praapt hote hai
 Since the SEBI Act does not contain specific provisions like Section 245B to 245N of the Income Tax Act 1961 to give SEBI the authority to grant advance decisions, SEBI provided explanatory letter / 'no action' letter under the provisions of SEBI Scheme 2003 Developed a system of doing
 haalanki is yojana ke tahat die jane vaale dishanirdesh iskar adhinium ke tahat die jane vaale agrim vinirnay ke samaan nahin he kyonki yah sebi board ke liye baadhyatamoolak nahin he
 Advance rulings for the securities market will give the market participant the ability to obtain compulsory rulings on the applicability of the special provision of the securities law to him prior to the proposed transaction
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki agrim vinirnay pranali nishchit rup se kathith yojana ke tahat pradaan kiye jane vaale anaupchaarik maargdarshan se adhik behatar hoti he kyonki sebi dwaara pradaan kiya jane vaala agrim vinirnay iske board par badhyakaari hoga
 The binding effect not only provides more comfort to market participants but it also gives better legal status to the entire mechanism
 haalanki prachlit anaupchaarik maargdarshan yojana kii sucharu or santoshjanak kriyasheeltaa kii drushti se samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ko is vikalp kaa bahut saavdhaanee se vishleshan karnaa chahie kyonki yojana se agrim vinirnay ke sthanantaran kii taraf uthne vaale kadam ke liye iskar adhinium kii tarah ek alag vibhaag or buniyadi dhaanche kii sthapana kerani padegi
 The Group suggests that since legally advance ruling is preferable, its approval can be considered and informal guidance scheme can also be continued
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 main esaro ko badhaava dene or use viniyamit karne kaa praavdhaan he
 However, there is no specific provision for empowering sros to create bye laws with statutory power for entry of members into the SEBI Act
 iske alaava company adhinium 1956 main shaamil hone ke baavjood sebi adhinium main sebi dwaara esaro ke shaasi board ke adhikraman se sambandhit yaa esaro ke sadasyon ke matadhikaron ko simit karne se sambandhit koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Such amendments have been proposed to provide such power to SEBI
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi ne esaro ke viniman ke liye sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 ke saath dhara 30 ke tahat pehle se hi viniyamon arthath sebi vinium 2004 ko taiyaar kar liya he jiske liye anya sabhi ikaayiyon ke saath esaro ko bhi sebi se manyata praapt karne kii jarurat he
 These regulations also provide the SRO with the power to formulate rules and bye-laws with the approval of SEBI
 esaro ko niyantrit karne vaale vinium ke vinium 23 main sebi ko manyata waapas lene kii shakti pradaan karne kaa praavdhaan he
 In view of the perceived power the group felt that SEBI already has the requisite power to compel the sros to regulate their activities as per the regulations
 natijatan iske liye sambhawatah sebi adhinium main sanshodhan karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 According to the recommendation of the group, there is no need for a proposed amendment to the SEBI Act
 sebi dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye vinium esaro ke ek niamak ke rup main sebi kii chintaa ko dur karne ke liye paryaapt hona chahie
 The Group stated that there is no provision in the SEBI Act which empowers SEBI to rectify clear clerical or typographical errors in its own orders
 is vichaar ko bhi prakat kiya gaya ki sebi ko un maamalon main bhi apane khud ke adeshon kii samiksha karne kaa adhikaar nahin he jab un adeshon ko ekatarfa jari kiya gaya ho
 The group observed that the "review of orders" appears to confer fundamental powers that ordinarily the authorities with original jurisdiction do not have
 haalanki samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki bank evam vittiya santhaan baaki rin raashi vasuuli adhinium 1993 kii dhara 26 kii tarah sebi ko apane aadesh se judi lipic yaa tankan trutiyon ko thik karne kii kshamta pradaan kii jaani chahie
 Banks and financial institutions, like Section 26 of the Rest of the Loan Recovery Act 1993, should be amended to provide SEBI the ability to correct clerical or typographical errors associated with its order
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium ke maujuuda praavdhaanon main sebi ke paas bazaar pratibhaagiyon ko raahat pradaan karne ke simit uddeshy se purvyaapee prabhaav vaale viniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The Group felt that SEBI has the power to create retrospective effect regulations in relation to procedural matters like the Income Tax Act or matters relating to fee charges for the limited purpose of providing relief and not to carry the burden of new liabilities and responsibilities
 Can be provided samooh ke mutabik is tarah ke udaar praavdhaan kuch maamalon main bazaar pratibhaagiyon kii anuchit pareshaani ko dur kar sakati he or isliye is par sakaaratmak dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 As per the recommendation of the group, SEBI is empowered to formulate regulations with due effect in respect of matters relating to procedural matters or fee charges for the limited purpose of providing limited relief and benefits and not to carry the burden of new liabilities and responsibilities
 To amend the SEBI Act in accordance with Section 295 of the Income Tax Act, 1961
 samooh ne pratibhutiyon ke maamle main anya kanoonon par sebi adhinium ko adhibhavi prabhaav pradaan karne ke liye sebi adhinium main sudhaar karne ke suzav par charchaa kii
 In evaluating the need for such amendments, the group tried to identify the fundamental provisions of the SEBI Act which would be able to achieve an overriding effect
 uchit soch vichaar karne ke baad samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi adhinium main aisa koi moulik praavdhaan nahin he jo ek adhibhavi prabhaav praapt karne ke laayak ho
 The group also said that the SEBI Act has already done this by non-mandatory clauses wherever the original provisions were capable of achieving overriding effect
 samooh kii sifarish ke anusaar anya kanoonon par sebi adhinium ko adhibhavi prabhaav pradaan karne ke liye sebi adhinium main sanshodhan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The group examined the proposal to amend the provisions of the SEBI Act to provide statutory authority to SEBI to issue circulars and guidelines
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 ke tahat paripatron or dishanirdeshon ko jari karata rahaa he
 The Group felt that there is no legal difficulty in issuing circulars or guidelines under the existing provisions of Section 11, the source of the inherent rights of SEBI
 samooh kii sifarish ke mutabik paripatr or dishanirdeshon ko jari karne ke liye sebi adhinium main ek vishisht praavdhaan shaamil karne ke liye ise sanshodhit nahin kiya ja saktaa he kyonki sebi ko pehle se hi sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 ke tahat aisa karne kaa anternihit adhikaar praapt he
 The group was told that in cases of fraudulent issuance of securities and excessive dematerialization of securities, SEBI should be empowered to declare such transactions void
 kisi vishisht vinium ke ulanghan kii sthiti main is tarah ke lendenon ko shunya ghoshit karne ke liye esasiare kii dhara 9 or dhara 14 kii tarah sebi adhinium main upyukt praavdhaan kiya janaa chahie
 The group felt that such power should be exercised by an independent body, especially civil courts
 prashasnic nikaayon ko is tarah kaa adhikaar nahin diya ja saktaa he
 The SEBI Act should not be amended under the given proposal
 is tarah kii shakti yaa adhikaar ko khaas taur par naagarik adaalat ke liye chhod diya janaa chahie
 The group was told that one of the principles of the Securities Regulations, as per the specifications of IOSCO / FSAP, is that the process of dealing with the failure of a market intermediary should be arranged to minimize the loss and loss of investors and involve systematic risk 
 samooh ne kaha ki kisi bichauliye ke diwalia hone yaa is tarah ke bichauliye kii nirantarata ko niveshkon yaa is tarah ke bichauliye ke graahakon ke hit ke liye hanikaarak maane jane par is tarah ke bichauliye ke samaapan ke liye kadam uthaane ke liye sebi adhinium ke tahat sebi ko koi vishesh adhikaar pradaan nahin kiya gaya he
 The group said that the Reserve Bank of India has the authority to file a winding up petition against the non-banking finance company under Section 45 MC of the RBI Act
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ke paas sebi adhinium ke tahat samaapan yachika daayar karne kaa samatuly adhikaar hona chahie
 Further, the Group observed that in case of winding up of such intermediary company, the claims of customers of such intermediaries should also be preferred over other claims or debts ie secured creditors and sovereign authorities like income tax
 is sambandh main samooh ne kaha ki banking niyaman adhinium 1949 kii dhara 43e ke tahat banking company kii parisampattiyon main se anya sabhi karjon main jamakartaon ke adhimaanya bhugtan ko praathamikta dene kaa praavdhaan he
 The Group felt that SEBI would be empowered to file a winding-up petition against such intermediaries if any middleman is deemed to be insolvent or the continuation of such intermediary is detrimental to the interest of the investors or the customers of such intermediaries
 Similar provisions should be made in relation to the claims of customers of time intermediary companies
 samooh kii sifarish ke anusaar sebi ko bhartiya reserve bank adhinium kii dhara 45emasi or banking niyaman adhinium kii dhara 43e kii tarj par madhyasth companiyon ke sambandh main samaapan yachika daayar karne main sakasham banane ke liye sebi adhinium main upyukt praavdhaan kiya ja saktaa he
 The group stated that an IOSCO principle for securities market regulations is that investors' funds should be kept separate from the assets of other entities through the regulatory system
 iske alaava insidar trading, graahakon ke saamne front running yaa trading or graahak kii parisampattiyon ke durupyog sahit bhraamak gatividhiyon, herpher yaa dhokhadhadi se niveshkon kii raksha kii jaani chahie
 The group was told that the Securities Laws Bill 2003, a section 27B, was proposed to be included in the Securities Contract Act under which an investor could transfer his money or securities to an intermediary company that would hold such money or securities
 And who will use them according to the instructions of the investors
 is tarah ke paise yaa pratibhutiyaan madhyasth companiyon kii parisampattiyon kaa hissaa nahin hogi or kisi bhi praadhikari dwaara niveshkon kii aisi parisampattiyon ko jabt nahin kiya jayega yaa aisi parisampattiyon ke saath kisi bhi praadhikari kaa koi sambandh nahin hoga
 However the Securities Laws Act 2005 did not include this provision
 samooh ne kaha ki kisi niveshak dwaara kisi madhyasth company ko saunpe gaye paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko aise niveshkon ke vishwasit madhyasth company dwaara dhaaran kiya janaa chahie
 Such money or securities of the investors should not be made part of the assets of the intermediary company and these assets of the investors will not be seized by any authority or have anything to do with any authority that is under the protection of such intermediary company or Be in possession samooh kii sifarish ke mutabik sebi adhinium main ek vishesh praavdhaan hona chahie jiske tahat graahakon ke paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko madhyasth companiyon dwaara ek trust ke rup main dhaaran kiya janaa chahie or madhyasth company ke kabje main rahane vaali niveshkon kii parisampattiyon par kisi praadhikari kaa koi kabza yaa koi len-dein nahin hoga
 To fulfill this objective, the proposed provision in the Securities Laws Bill 2003 can be introduced
