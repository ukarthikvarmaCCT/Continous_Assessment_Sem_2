 Definitive words are words, composite-words or multi-literal expressions that are used to have specific meaning in a specific context
 ye 'vishisht arth' un shabdon ke 'saamaanya upyog ke arth' se bahut alag ho sakate hai
 For example, 'work' in the ordinary sense means to do any work - such as eating, laughing, walking, reading, etc

 Ludwig Wittgenstein was the philosopher of Austria
 unhone tarkshastra, ganit kaa darshan, man kaa darshan, evam bhashaa ke darshan par mukhyatah kaary kiya
 He is counted among the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century
 unke jite ji ek hi pustak prakashit ho pai - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 Philosophical Investigations became quite popular in later published books
 vitgenshtin cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke professor rahe hai
 Wittgenstein's father Karl was a Jew who later adopted the Protestant religion
 vitganstin kaa sabase bada yogadan bhashaa ko darshanik paripekshya main rakhane kaa he
 When anyone mentions philosophy in linguistics today, Wittgenstein's name is automatically remembered
 vitganstin ke lekhan se kaaphi tark-vitark upja he, yahan tak ki kai baar vitganstin ke kaam ko darshanavipareet bhi kaha gaya he, kintu aisa kahana isaliye galat hoga ki vitganstin se pehle bhi tarkshastriyon ne bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan par jor daalaa tha
 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"

 This combination of useful and related resources, linked together by hypertext links, was called the "web" of information
 isko internet par uplabdh karaane ko tim berners lee nen sarvapratham 1990 main vishwavyapiweb kaa naam diya
 Characteristics of the underlying ideas of the origins of the web began to be found in 1980 when Tim berners-lee wrote the Enquirer at CERN, which he had studied in childhood
 haalaanki aaj istemaal hone vaali pranali se ye bhinn tha lekin iske mul vichaar kaaphi had tak saamaan the ke vichaar bhi) In March 1989, Tim berners-lee wrote a proposal that described the Enquirer and described a more detailed information system

 This date is also remembered as the beginning of a publicly available service on the Internet of the Web

 Important basic ideas such as hypertext originated from older projects in the 1960s - Ted Nelson and Andreas van Dame - Ted Nelson's Project Zanadu and Douglas Engelbert's on-line Systems
 Both Nelson and Engelbert were based on Vannevar Bush's microfilm " "memex", which was described in a 1945 essay as "think of us"

 Bhaskaracharya discusses permutations in Lilavati's chapter titled 'akpash' At number of places which are filled with equal nymbers of digits, place 1, 2, 3, 4 


 in increasing order
 The product of these digits is the required number of permutations
 Similarly, In the given digits, if some digits are repeated, then at those number of places find number of permutations assuming different digits
 Divide by this number, the number of permutations of all given digits, assuming different digits at all places
 Similarly, Mahaviracharya has given the following formula for total collections of some given items in the Mathematics collection
 in order below; the product in the reverse order is divided by the product in order; is the result
 It is noteworthy that several centuries later in 1634 AD, exactly the same formula was given by Herrigon
 bhartiya ganitagyon ne hi dwipad gunank nikaale jo aage chalakar pascal trikon naam se prasiddh hue
 In the second half of the twentieth century, the study of permutation gained momentum and dozens of journals of this subject came into existence and many seminars were held on this subject

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 parantu unke saamne samasya thi ki ise vyavhaarik kaise banaaya jaay taaki saamaajik tanaav kam ho
 He believed that there should be proper management of education
 shiksha main dharmik shiksha kaa samavesh ho
 To give such education, he founded the Central Hindu School in Varanasi in 1898

 Dr
 Annie Besant believed that it is not possible to solve all these difficulties without political freedom
 dow ani bessent swabhaavat: dharmik pravriti kii mahila thim
 The foundation of his political thought was his spiritual and moral values
 unka vichaar tha ki achchhai ke maarg kaa nirdhaaran bina aadhyatm ke sambhav nahin
 To achieve a welfare life, human desires should be subject to divine will
 raashtra kaa nirmaan evam vikaas tabhi sambhav he jab us desh ke vibhinn dharmon, manyataon evam samskritiyon main ekta sthapit ho
 Knowledge of true religion is attained only by spiritual consciousness
 unke in vichaaron ko mahatma gandhi ne bhi sweekaar kiya
 The nature of civilization and culture of ancient India was spiritual
 yahi aadhyatmikta us samay ke bharatiyon kii nidhi thi
 The aim of Dr
 Besant was to remove the distortions in Hindu society and its spirituality
 unhone bhartiya punarjanm main vishwaas karnaa shuru kiya
 She was convinced that she was a Hindu in a previous life
 vah dharm or vigyaan main koi bhed nahin maanati thim
 He had full faith in religious tolerance
 unhone bhartiya dharm kaa gambheer adhyayan kiya
 His translation of the Bhagavad Gita 'that's on the study of the Bhagavad Gita' is a proof that he had deep faith in Hindu religion and philosophy
 ve kaha karti thim ki hindu dharm main itane sampradaayon kaa hona is baat kaa pramaan he ki isamen swatantra bauddhik vikaas ko protsaahan diya jaataa he
 She believed that India only had the ability to guide the world
 ve bharat ke sadiyon se andh vishwaason se grast maanav ko mukt karnaa chaahati thim
 Dr
 Besant saw the ideal of service to the poor in socialism
 garibi dur karne ke liye unka vishwaas tha ki audyogikaran ho
 He saw that the woman had no freedom
 ve log bhoga kii vastu samajhi jaati thim
 Dr
 Besant's heart was moved by this sad state
 unhone nari suraksha kaa prashn uthaaya or jor dekar kaha ki samaaj main sarvangin vikaas ke liye nari adhikaron ko surakshit karnaa aavashyak he
 Dr
 Besant was an advocate of the ancient religion based varna system
 varna vyavastha kaa mukhya uddeshy kaary vibhaajan tha jiske anusaar samaaj kaa prayek vyakti apane kaaryon ko karne kii yogyata dwaara brahman, kshatriya, vaisya evam shudra kaa sthaan praapt karata tha
 She used to say that according to Mahabharata, a Brahmin has the qualities of a Shudra and is a Shudra
 shudra main agar brahman ke gun hai to vah brahman samajha jaayga
 Traveling abroad was considered irreligious at that time
 unhone bataaya ki pracheen aitihaasik tathyon se pataa chalata he ki shyaam, java, sumatra, kamboj, lanka, tibet tathaa china aadi deshon main hindu rajya ke chihn paye gayi hai
 Hence, foreign travel of Hindus is certified

 According to him, uplifting the nation with the combination of spiritual intelligence and physical strength has been the specialty of ancient India
 ve vidhwaa vivaah ko dharm maanati thim
 He believed that except adult widows, adolescent and youth widows should marry to prevent social evil
 ve antarjaatiy vivaahon ko bhi dharm sammat maanati thim
 She considered polygamy as an insult to women's pride and a curse of society
 kisi bhi desh ke nirmaan main prabud varg kii bhoomika mahatvapurn hoti he
 This enlightened class is a product of that country's education
 at: shiksha vyavastha ko ve atyadhik mahatv detii thim
 He insisted that religious and moral education should be compulsorily taught in education courses and to be based on ancient Indian ideals
 unki dharna thi ki prayek bhartiya ko sanskrit tathaa angreji donon kaa gyaan hona chaiye
 From 1913 to 1919 she was one of the leading personalities in Indian political life
 sitambar 1916 main unhone homerul lig kii sthapana kii or swarajya ke adarsh ko lokapriy banane ke liye prachaar kiya kintu 1919 ke baad ve akeli pad gayi
 The immediate reason for this was his dispute with Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 jab gandhi ji ne apana satyagrah aandolan prarambh kiya to vah bhartiya raajnneeti kii mukhya dhara se or bhi pruthak ho gai
 It is a matter of great misfortune that Annie Besant condemned Gandhiji's non-cooperation movement in a very unsympathetic language, describing his movement as revolutionary, anarchist, and a movement that exudes hatred and violence
 gandhi ke darshan evam netritv ko unhone swatantraaa ke maarg main sabase badi baadha bataaya tha
 He described Gandhiji as an obscure swaraj watcher and a mystic politician
 unhen is baat se sandeh tha ki gandhi ji sachche hriday se pashchaatap, upwas, tapasya aadi main vishwaas karte hai
 He warned the people of the country that if the Gandhian system was adopted, the country would again fall into the ravine of anarchy
