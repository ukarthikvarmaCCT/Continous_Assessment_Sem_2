 ve mahatma buddha ke nijee vaidya the
 He was born as the son of a courtesan in the capital of Magadha (present Rajgir) during the reign of Bimbasar
 janm ke pashchaat lok laaj se bachaane hetu unhen ek kooday ke dher par phenk diya gaya tha
 Fortunately, he was caught sight of Emperor Bimbisara's son Kumar Abhay
 kumaar ne uske jivan kii raksha kii tathaa apni dekh rekh main uske bharan–poshan kaa prabandh kar diya
 After completing his education in Rajgriha, Kumar sent him to Taxila for higher education
 vahaan ve saat varsh tak chikitsa shaastra kaa safalataa purvak adhyayan kiya
 He was a disciple of Atreya
 samraat bimbisar ke putr abhaya kumaar ko van main ek navjaat shishu padaa mila
 Seeing him, he felt compassion
 vah shishu ko uthaakar ghar le aayaa
 The child was named - Jeevak
 use khub padhaayaa-likhaaya
 When Jeevak grew up, one day he suddenly asked Abhay Kumar, 'who are my parents?' Abhay Kumar was surprised at his question but thought that it would not be right to hide anything from Jeevak
 usne use sari baat bataa di ki kis tarah vah use jangal main padaa mila tha
 The creature said, 'where should i go with the burden of selflessness?' On this, Abhay Kumar tied him up and said, 'vats, instead of being unhappy about this thing, go to Taxila and study there concentrated and give light of your knowledge to the society
 ' jeevak vidyadhyayan ke liye takshashila chal padaa
 At the time of admission, Acharya asked the name, father's name, Kul and gotra, then he clearly told everything
 acharya ne uski spashtvaadita se prabhavit hokar use pravesh de diya
 Jeevak worked hard there and earned the title of Ayurvedacharya
 uske acharya chaahate the ki vah magadh jaae or vahaan rahakar logon kii seva kare
 Jeevak was constantly troubled by the same old question
 use pareshaan dekhakar acharya ne poocha, 'vatsa tum is tarah udhaas kyon ho?' is par jeevak ne uttar diya, 'acharya aap jaanate hai ki meraa koi kul or gotra nahin he
 Wherever i go, people will point fingers at me
 kya aap mujhe yahaan apane paas nahin rakh sakate, taaki main aapaki seva karata rahun
 'acharya said,' Vatsa your ability, talent and knowledge is your clan and gotra
 tum jahaan bhi jaaoge, vahiin tumhen sammaan milegaa
 It is your religion to dedicate yourself to the service of scarred beings
 isi se tumhaari pahchaan banegi
 Man is identified only by karma and not by clan and gotra
 ' is tarah jeevak ko aatmavishvaas kaa prakaash mila
 He became famous in Magadha as Ayurveda
 jeevak kii yogyata se purna santusht hokar acharya ne use vaidya kii oopaadhi pradaan kar di or swatantra rup se chikitsa karne kii anumati de di
 Acharya also gave him some money so that he could go from Taxila to Rajgriha
 takshashila se saket pahunchne tak jeevak kaa dhan kharch ho gaya
 He still had a long way to go
 atah dhan kii aavashyaktaa thi
 He stayed there in Saket to earn some money
 use gyaat hua ki ek seth kii patni bahut dinon se sir ke rog se aswasth he or vaidya use thik nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Jeevak started his treatment
 usne ghi main kuch jadi-bootiyaan ubaaleen or use mahila ko naak se pilaa diya
 With his treatment, Seth's wife became sick
 seth usase bahut prasann hua or uskaa bahut upkaar mana
 He gave 16000 mudras to Jeevak and also gave a chariot, horse and two servants
 jeevak ne rajgrih laut kar use kumaar abhaya ko de diya kyonki useene uskaa paalan-poshan kiya tha or uski shiksha kaa prabandh kiya tha
 In those days, Emperor Bimbisara was suffering from Bhagandar disease which is still considered incurable
 jeevak ne unki chikitsa kii or swasth kar diya
 He cured many incurable diseases, which spread his fame very far
 kaashi ke ek seth ne use apane putr kii chikitsa ke liye bulaayaa jisaki aanten ulajh gai thim
 Jeevak surgically corrected his intestines and re-stitched his stomach and gave him medicines for healing which he recovered
 is seth ne bhi jeevak ko 16000 mudraayen deen
 Udayot, the king of Ujjain, suffered from jaundice
 usne samraat bimbisar se anurodh kiya kuch dinon ke liye ve jeevak ko ujjain bhej den
 The creatures with medicated ghee also made them healthy
 raja ne uskaa bahut satkar kiya tathaa use bahut se uphaar evam bahumoolya vasteen dekar vidaa kiya
 Jivak also liberated Mahatma Buddha from constipation

 Later, on Ramachandra Deb establishing an independent kingdom in Khurda, the temple and its idols were restored
 
 According to the traditional legend associated with the origin of this temple, the original idol of Lord Jagannath made of Indranil or Sapphire was found under an Agaru tree
 yah itani chakchaundh karne vaali thi, ki dharm ne ise prithvi ke neeche chupaana chaha
 Malwa King Indradyumna saw this idol in his dream
 tab usne kadi tapasya kii or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne use bataaya ki vah puri ke samudr tat par jaye or use ek daaru kaa laththa milegaa
 He should build the idol with the same wood
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or use lakdi kaa laththa mil bhi gaya
 The king then appeared before him as Vishnu and Vishwakarma carpenter artisan and sculptor
 kintu unhone yah shart rakhi, ki ve ek maah main murti taiyaar kar denge, parantu tab tak vah ek kamare main band rahenge or raja yaa koi bhi us kamare ke andar nahin aaye
 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin
 Then the idols of the same three Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were installed in the temple
 
 Some historians believe that this temple was formerly a Buddhist stupa in its place
 us stupa main gautam buddha kaa ek daant rakhaa tha
 It was later moved to its present position, Kandy, Sri Lanka

 In his last days, he had also asked that the world famous Kohinoor diamond, which is the most valuable and the largest diamond in the world, be donated to this temple
 lekin yah sambhav naa ho sakaa, kyoki us samay tak, british ne punjab par apana adhikaar karke, unki sabhi shahi sampatti jabt kar lee thi
 Otherwise Kohinoor diamond would have been the pride of the crown of Lord Jagannath

 Rajendra Singh was the fourth Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which is known as Rajju Bhaiya everywhere from the common people to the Sangh Parivar
 ve elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main 1939 se 1943 tak vidhyaarthee rahe
 Subsequently, from 1943 to 1967, he was appointed first spokesman in the Physics Department, then Professor and finally Head of the Department

 Rajju Bhaiya was born on 29 January 1922 in Engineers Colony, Shahjahanpur City, Uttar Pradesh, from the womb of Jwala Devi, the wife of Ind Balbir Singh
 us samay unke pitaaji balbir singh vahaan sichaai vibhaag main abhiyanta ke rup main tainaat the
 Balbir Singh ji was originally a resident of Banail Pahasu village of Bulandshahr district of Uttar Pradesh, who later retired from the post of Chief Engineer from the Irrigation Department of Uttar Pradesh

 According to the family's tradition, all the children used to address their mother Jwala Devi as "jiaji"

 He had two elder sisters - Sushila and Chandravati and two younger brothers - Vijender Singh and Yatindra Singh were in the Indian Administrative Service and held high positions in the central and state government

 Shri Ram Prasad along with 'bismil' Premkrishna Khanna often used to come to meet the people of this colony
 mere pitaaji mujhe bataaya karte the ki 'bismil' ji ke prati sabhi ke man main apaar shraddha thi
 His life was very pure and simple, due to regular yoga and exercise daily, the body was very strong and powerful and the mouth was filled with vigor and strength

 Rajendra Singh Sarsanghchalak Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh rajju bhaiya kii sangh yatra asaamaanya he
 He came to Prayag in his youth with a vigilant and fully developed merit power in his youth

 paas karte hi ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main vyaakhyaata pad paane ke saath-saath prayag ke nagar kaayrvah kaa daayitv sanbhaalane kii sthiti main pahunch gayi
 Prayag Department's proceedings in 1946, Jail Yatra in 1948, Divisional Affairs in 1949 comprising two three departments, Province Work in 1952 and Bhaurao Deoras in 1954, took over the responsibility of the entire province after leaving the province
 1961 main bhaurav ke waapas lautne par praant-prachaarak kaa daayitv unhen waapas dekar sah praant-prachaarak ke rup main pun:unke sahyogi bane
 If the scope of Bhaurao expanded, then again from 1962 to 1965, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh's pracharak, from 1966 to 1974, he was the field-preacher and field-preacher
 1975 se 1977 tak apatkaal main bhumigat rahakar loktantr kii vaapasi kaa aandolan khadaa kiya
 When he became a co-government in 1977, Madhavrao Mule was also given the responsibility of head-work in March 1978
 1978 se 1987 tak is daayitv kaa nirvaah karke 1987 main ho0 ve0 sheshadri ko yah daayitv dekar sah-sarkarywah ke rup main unke sahyogi bane
 In 1994, when the then Sarsanghchalak Bala Saheb Deoras started looking for his successor due to his declining health, everyone's eyes were fixed on Rajju Bhaiya and on 11 March 1994, Bala Saheb automatically handed over the top responsibility of Sarsanghchalak to him
 sangh ke itihaas main yah ek asaamaanya ghatana thi
 The eyes of the publicity media and the critics of the Sangh were torn by seeing this scene
 unhen vishwaas hi nahin ho rahaa tha ki jis rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par ve ab tak maharashtriyan brahmanon ke ekadhikaar kii chhavi thopate aaye hai, uske shikhar par uttar bharat kaa koi gaiyr-maharashtrin abrahman pahunch saktaa he - vah bhi sarvasammati se
 Rajju Bhaiya's body was diseased and relaxed at that time, but he made a lot of effort to fulfill the responsibility entrusted to him
 parantu ahernish kaary or samaaj-chintan se buree tarah tut chuke apane sharir se bhala or kab tak kaam liya ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, in 1999, he made up his mind to hand over the responsibility to someone younger
 or ant main apane sahyogiyon ke aagrahpurn anurodh kaa aadar karte hue ek varsh kii pratiksha ke baad, march 2000 main sudarshan ji ko yah daayitv saupakar svaichhik pad-sanyas kaa sangh ke samaksh ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Rajju Bhaiyya's 60-year long Sangh Yatra is not only unusual in terms of how he has successfully carried out huge responsibilities one after the other, but also with the view that from 1943 to 1966 he was with teaching work at Prayag University- Like a full-time evangelist, he wandered from place to place, carrying out all the responsibilities
 sangh-kaary hetu apni kshamta ko badhaane ke liye ve sangh shiksha varg main teen varsh ke paramparaagat prashikshan par nirbhar nahin rahe
 He received his first year training in 1947 when he had reached the status of city stewardship of Prayag
 Had prepared for tritiy varsh unhone 1957 main kiya jab ve uttar pradesh jaise bade praant kaa daayitv sanbhaal rahe the
 It is clear from this that he did the formality of training for three years to present a worthy example in front of other volunteers of the Sangh, not to gain merit for himself
 prayag vishvavidhyalay main padhaate hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main prachaarkavat jute rahe
 He was formally declared a pracharak in 1958, but the truth is that he himself gave the role of pracharak to the office of stewardship
 bhautik shaastra jaise good vishay par asaamaanya adhikaar rakhane ke saath-saath atyant saral va rochak adhyaapan style or apane shishyon ke prati sneh bhaavana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya prayag vishvavidhyalay ke sarvaadhik lokapriy or safal praadhyaapak the
 Due to seniority and qualification, he also had to hold the responsibility of the post of chairman of the department along with the professor
 kintu yah sab karte hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah puri tarah karte rahe
 He never wished to become a reader or a professor
 jin dinon prayag vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee vibhaag ke reader pad ke liye aavden maange gayi unhone aavedan patr hi nahin diya
 The colleagues asked that Rajju brother! Why did you do it? So he answered very easily - "oh my life work is union work, not a university professor
 abhi main saptaah main chaar din kakshayen letaa hoon, teen din sangh-kaary ke liye daura karata hoon
 Sometimes even after trying hard, the university is unable to reach on time
 abhi to vibhaag ke sab adhyaaapak meraa sahyog karte hai kintu yadi main reader pad par abhyaarthee bana to ve mujhe apana pratispardhi samajhane lagenge
 So why get stuck in this digestion
 " rajju bhaiya kaa sampoorn jivan is baat kaa sakshi he ki unhen pad kii aakanksha athwa uskaa moh kabhi rahaa hi nahin
 Even as a teacher in the university, he did not earn for himself
 ve apane vetan kii ek-ek pai ko sangh-kaary par vyay kar dete the
 Even after being born into a rich family, getting education in public schools, interest in sports like music and cricket, he used to spend least on himself
 mitvyayta kaa ve apurv udhaaharan the
 At the end of the year, whatever was left of his salary, he was offered to the society as guru-dakshina
 ek baar rashtradharm prakaashan aarthik sankat main fas gaya to unhone apane pitaaji se aagrah karke apane hisse kii dhanrashi dekar rashtradharm prakaashan ko sankat se ubaara
 This was an expression of his all-round sanity! ni:swaarth sneh or nishkaam karm sadhana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya sabake priy tha
 Both within and outside the union
 purushottam das tandon or laal bahadur shastri jaise rajanetaaon ke saath-saath prabhudutt brahmacharee jaise santon kaa vishwaas or sneh bhi unhone arjeet kiya tha
 Along with a very sensitive conscience, Rajju Bhaiyya was also very realistic
 ve kisi se bhi koi bhi baat nixsancoach kah dete the or unki baat ko taalna kathin ho jaataa tha
 After the Emergency, when it was decided to give Nanaji Deshmukh the post of Minister of Industry in the Janata Party government, Rajju Bhaiya told him that if Nanaji will go into the government if you, Atalji and Advaniji - then who will take care of the organization by staying outside? Respecting his wish, Nanaji immediately turned down the mantripad and accepted to be the general secretary of the Janata Party
 chaahe atalji hon, yaa adwaniji; ashokaji sinhal hon, yaa dattopant thengdiji - harek sheersh netaa rajju bhaiya kii baat kaa aadar karata tha; kyonki uske peeche swaarth, kutilata yaa gutbandi kii bhaavana nahin hoti thi
 From this point of view, Rajju Bhaiya was indeed a link connecting not only the Bodhi tree but all of the Sangh Parivar, but a source of moral strength and influence
 unke chale jane se keval sangh hi nahin apitu bharat ke saarvajanik jivan main ek yug kaa ant ho gaya he
 Rajju Bhaiya was not just the body of the bones
 ve swayan main dhyeynishtha, sankalp va murtimant adarshavaad kii saakshaat pratimurti the
 Therefore Rajju Bhaiya will always live in the conscience of all
 dekha jaye to rajju bhaiya aaj mar kar bhi amar hai
 Rajju Bhaiya was very sad that our leaders could not build a grand memorial in this country in the name of revolutionary 'bismil'
 ve turki ke rashtriya smarak jaisaa smarak bharat kii rajdhani dilli main bana hua dekhnaa chaahate the
 He had said: "it is a different thing to garner applause to enhance your image by giving a waxed speech, it is a different thing to do something for others by staying in the back

 computing yani sanganan main feed agrigater, jise feed reader, news reader yaa saadharantah agrigater kaha jaataa he ek desktop yaa web anuprayog hota he jo ki internet par muhaiyaa syndicated masaude, masalan samachar surkhiyaan, blog, podcast or vlog kaa sankalan kar ek hi sthaan par use pradarshit karata he
 As this content keeps on changing or updating, the compiler has to constantly monitor the draft feed
 is lekh main agrigater ke liye sankalak shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, par dhyaan rahe ki yah maanak shabd nahin he
 The syndicated draft that the compiler accepts is usually provided in RSS or any other formatted format such as RDF or Atom
 sankalak jaalasthalon yani websits par nai saamagree jode jane kaa pataa lagane main vyay hone vaale samay va shram kii bachat karata he or ek tarah se pathak ke liye uskaa vyaktigat akhbaar bana kar use pesh karata he
 Once a feed has been subscribed or become a regular reader, the compiler locates the new content at fixed intervals according to the user's wish and delivers the content to it
 is takanic ko pul taknalaji kaha jaataa he
 This is the exact opposite of push technology used in tools such as email or instant messaging
 saath hi push takanic se saamagree ke graahakon kii tulana main sankalak badi saralata se kisi bhi feed se anasbsakraib kar saktaa he yani uskaa pathak banane se inkaar kar saktaa he
 Most compilers also allow the user to export and import a list of feeds read by his or other readers in OPML format
 kai portal jaalasthalon main sankalan kii suvidha jalsthal par hi muhaiyaa he, masalan maai yahuu yaa ai google par
 This feature is also available on modern web browsers and email programs
 sankalak masaude ko samahit kar kisi ek hi brouzar yaa desktop anuprayog par pesh kar detaa he
 These applications are also called RSS readers, feed readers, feed aggregators, news readers or search aggregators
 jin sankalkon main podcasting kii kabaliyat he ve swatah media filein jaise kii empi3 ricarding kaa adhibharan yaa downlod bhi kar saktaa he
 In some cases, it can also load these files directly into portable media players such as ipods connected to computers
 haal hi main kuch naye sankalak, jinhen "aresas narator" pukaara ja rahaa he, bhi maidan main utre hai jo na keval feed masaude kaa sankalan karte hai balki unhen aflin yani internet se jude bagaiyr audio ricarding ke rup main sunne kii suvidha dete hai
 Web-based compilers are applications that are located on remote servers and are used on a network of applications such as Google Reader or bloglines
 chunki ye anuprayog internet ke madhyam se prayukt hote hai atah prayokta apni sabsakribd feed ko jahaan bhi internet sampark uplabdh ho vahaan pard saktaa he
 Modern compilers use technologies like Agax and are also available as multiple widgets
 vyaktigat sankalkon ke alaava saamudayik sankalak bhi hote hai jo saamanytah kisi laghu samudaay ke feed kaa sankalan karte hai
 For example, see the page of the list of compilers at the end of the article
 clyant yaa desktop anuprayog kaa zyaadaatar computer par baqayda sthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Their graphical user interface is similar to most popular email clients such as Outlook, with a draft showing in most three panels, a list of subscribed feeds on the left, which can be grouped into groups, folders, or squares, and a draft entry in the right panel
 kai anuprayogon main tikar tepe yaa news tikar yaa alert ke rup main nai pravishtiyon ke bare main jaankaree hasil kii ja sakati he
 Many programming languages provide libraries that application builders or website owners can read feeds using or display or use in different formats
 udhaahranh sipan main, , aadi
 Media compilers, also known as podcatchers due to the popularity of podcasts, are compilers of feeds in which the draft is primarily audio or video
 feed main ye ke rup main daale jate hai
 These can be mesh or desktop based applications
 ye media ko downlod kar use chalaa sakate hai yaa ypod jaise kisi bahari media player ke saath sikronies bhi kar sakate hai
 Content redundancy is a fundamental problem with compilers, especially if the user is a reader of multiple feeds
 sankalak alag alag taur par is samasya se nibatate hai
 In addition to facilitating the categorization of feeds to the user, they take advantage of the tags and keywords attached to the entries

 sati, kuch puraatan bhartiya hindu samudaayon main prachlit ek aisi dharmik pratha thi, jisamen kisi purush kii mrityoparant uski patni uske antim sanskaar ke dauraan uski chita main swayamev pravisht hokar aatmatyag kar leti thi
 After the British declared it illegal in India in 1829, this practice almost ceased
 is pratha ko iskaa yah naam devi sati ke naam se mila he jinhen dakshayani ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to the Hindu religious texts, Goddess Sati had committed self-immolation by jumping in the fire of yajna, distressed by her father Daksha's disdain for her husband Mahadev Shiva
 sati shabd ko aksar akele yaa phir savitri shabd ke saath jodakar kisi "pavitra mahila" kii vyakhya karne ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he
 This was also one of the reasons for the practice of Sati in ancient times
 akramanakariyon dwaara jab purushon kii hatya kar di jaati thi, uske baad unki patniyaan apni asmita va atmasamman ko mahatvapurn samajhakar swayamev apane pati kii chita ke saath aatmatyag karne par vivash ho jaati thi
 Over time, due to the distortion of this voluntary compulsion of women, it became like a social practice, which came to be known as Sati practice
 brahm samaaj ke sansthaapak raja rammohan raay ne sati pratha ke viruddh samaaj ko jaagruk kiya
 As a result, this movement got a boost and the then English government was forced to enact a law to stop the practice of Sati
 antat: unhone san 1829 main sati pratha rokane kaa kanoon paarit kiya
 Thus came to an end the practice of sati from India

 This is the importance of what Aryabhata had discovered without the present day advanced means of astrology
 koparnicus ne jo khoj kii thi uski khoj aryabhat hajaar varsh pehle kar chuke the
 In "golapada", Aryabhata wrote "when a man in a boat moves with the flow, then he understands that the material trees, stones, mountains etc
 are going in reverse
 usee prakaar gatiman prithvi par se sthir nakshatra bhi ulti gati se jate hue dikhaai dete hai
 "thus Aryabhata first proved that the earth rotates on its axis
 inhone satyuga, treta, dwapar or kaliyug ko samaan mana he
 According to them, 14 manvantars in one kalpa and 72 mahayugas in one manvantar and Satyuga, Dwapara, Treta and Kaliyug in one chaturyuga are considered equal
 aryabhat ke anusaar kisi vrutt kii paridhi or vyas kaa sambandh 62,832 : 20,000 aata he jo chaar dashamalav sthaan tak shuddh he
 Aryabhata has used a very scientific method of representing large numbers with a group of letters
 sthaan-mulya ank pranali, jise sarvapratham teesri sadi kii bakhshali pandulipi main dekha gaya, unke kaaryon main spasht rup se vidyaman thi
 He did not use the symbol, of course, but according to the French mathematician Georges Efrah — with zero coefficients, knowledge of zero as a place holder for the power of ten was contained in Aryabhata's place-value digit system
 haalanki, aryabhat ne brahmi ankon kaa prayog nahin kiya tha; vaidic kaal se chali aa rahi sanskrit parampara ko nirantar rakhte hue unhone sankhya ko nirupit karne ke liye varnmaala ke aksharon kaa upyog kiya,matraaon ko smarak ke rup main vyakt karnaa
 Aryabhata worked on Pai's approximation and may have come to know that Pai is irrational
 aryabhatium ke duusare bhaag main ve likhte hai: Accordingly , the ratio of diameter and circumference is × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416, which is perfectly accurate up to five important figures
 aryabhat ne asann, pichley shabd ke thik pehle aane vaala, shabd kii vyakhya kii vyakhya karte hue kaha he ki yah na keval ek sanniktan he, varan yah ki mulya athulaneey he
 If this is correct, then this is a very sophisticated approach, as the irrationality of pi in Europe was proved only by Lambert in 1761
 aryabhatiy ke arabi main anuwaad ke pashchaat bijganit par mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi kii pustak main is sanniktan kaa ullekh kiya gaya tha
 In Mathematica 6, Aryabhata describes the area of a triangle as: iskaa anuwaad yah he : kisi tribhuj kaa kshetrafal, lamb ke saath bhujaa ke aadhe ke parinaam ke baraabar hota he
 Aryabhata has discussed the subject of duality in his work and named it Ardha-jya which literally means "ardha-tantra"
 aasaani kii vajah se logon ne ise jya kahana shuru kar diya
 When his work was translated from Sanskrit to Arabic by Arabic writers, he called it Jiba
 chunki, arabi lekhan main, swaron kaa istemaal bahut kam hota he, isliye iskaa or sankshipt naam pad gaya jb
 When later writers came to understand that JB is a short form of Jiba, they started using Jiba back
 jiba kaa arth he "khoh" yaa "khai" 
 Later in the twelfth century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jiba with its Latin counterpart sinus, which literally means "lair" or trench
 or uske baad angreji main, sinus hi sin ban gaya
 a problem of particular interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to equations that are in the form ax + b = cy, a topic known today as the diophantine equation
 yahan aryabhatiy par bhaskar kii vyakhya se ek udhaaharan dete hai: That is, say n = 8x + 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 This leaves the smallest value 85 for N
 saamaanya taur par, diophentine sameekaran kathinata ke liye badnaam the
 Such equations are widely discussed in the ancient Vedic text Sulab Sutra, the more ancient parts of which date back to 800 BC
 Can be older
 aisi samasyaon ke hal ke liye aryabhat kii vidhi ko kuttak vidhi kaha gaya he
 kuṭṭaka kuttak means grinding, that is, breaking into small pieces and this method consisted of a recursive algorithm for writing the original segments as small numbers
 aaj yah kalanvidhi, 621 isvi pashchaat main bhaskar kii vyakhya ke anusaar, pehle kram ke diophentine samikarnon ko hal karne ke liye maanak paddati he,or ise aksar aryabhat elgoridm ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Diophantine equations are used in cryptology and the RSA Convention, 2006 focused on the Kuttaka method and earlier works of Sulvasutra
 aryabhatiy main aryabhat ne virgon or ghanon kii shrenee ke rochak parinaam pradaan kiye hai
 And aryabhat kii khagol vigyaan pranali audaayak pranali kehalaati thi, khagol vigyaan par unke baad ke lekh, jo satahi taur parek dwitiya model, prastaavit karte hai, kho gaye hai, parantu inhe aanshik rup se brahmagupta ke khandakhadyak main hui charchaaon se punah nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some texts, they attribute the rotation of the Earth to the virtual motion of the sky
 prathit hota he ki aryabhat yah maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree kii parikrama karti he
 This is known from a statement referencing Sri Lanka, which describes the motion of stars as the relative motion produced by the rotation of the Earth
 aglaa chand taron or grahon kii gati ko vaastavik gati ke rup main varnit karata he: Lanka here is a reference point on the equator, which was taken to be the same value in terms of the meridian for astronomical calculations
 aryabhat ne saura mandal ke ek bhukendriya model kaa varnan kiya he, jisame surya or chandramaa gruhachakra dwaara gati karte hai, jo ki parikrama karata heprithvi kii
 In this model, which is found in the Pitamahist theory, the motion of each of the planets is controlled by two planetary cycles, a small slow planetary cycle and a large early planetary cycle
 prithvi se duuri ke anusaar grahon kaa kram is prakaar he : chandramaa, budh, shukr, suraj, mangal,brihaspati, shani or nakshatra The position and duration of the planets were calculated as relative to points moving uniformly, in the case of Mercury and Venus, which revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the average Sun, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn In the case of, which move around the Earth in the zodiac at their specific speed
 khagol vigyaan ke adhikansh itihaaskaaron ke anusaar yah dwi grahchakr vaala model tolemi ke pehle ke greek khagol vigyaanke tatwon ko pradarshit karata he
 Another element of Aryabhata's model, the Sighrocca, the period of the basic planets in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a mark of an underlying Sun-centered model
 unhone kaha ki chandramaa or grah surya ke paravartit prakaash se chamakate hai
 Unlike the existing cosmology, in which the eclipses were the pseudo-planet Nispand point Rahu and Ketu, they described the eclipses as being cast by the earth and the shadow falling on it
 is prakaar chandragahan tab hota he jab chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh karata he or prithvi kii is chaaya ke aakaar or vistaar kii vistaar se charchaa kii or phir grahan ke dauraan grahan vaale bhaag kaa aakaar or isaki gananaa
 Later Indian astronomers improved these calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the major gist
 yah gananaatmak misaal itani sateek thi ki 18 veen sadi ke vaigyanik guilom le jentil ne, pandicherry kii apni yatra ke dauraan, paaya ki bharatiyon kii gananaa ke anusaar 1765-08-30 ke chandragrahan kii avadhi 41 second kam thi, jabaki uske chart 68 second adhik darshaate the
 According to Aryabhata, the circumference of the Earth is 39,968
0582 kilometers, which is only 0
2% less than its actual value of 40,075
0167 kilometers
 yah sanniktan unani ganitagya, eratosthenas kii sanganana ke upar ek ullekhneey sudhaar tha,200 i
) jinaki gananaa kaa aadhunik ikaayiyon main to pataa nahin he, parantu unke anumaan main lagbhag 5-10% kii ek truti avashya thi
 If added to the modern English units of time, Aryabhata's calculation of the Earth's period of time) was 23 hours 56 minutes and 4
1 seconds; Modern time is 23: 56: 4
091
 isi prakaar, unke hisaab se prithvi ke varsh kii avadhi 365 din 6 ghante 12 minute 30 second, aadhunik samay kii gananaa ke anusaar isamen 3 minute 20 second kii truti he
 The perception of the constellation of time was known in most other astronomical systems at that time, but this computation was probably the purest at that time
 aryabhat kaa daawa tha ki prithvi apni hi dhuree par gumti he or unke grah sambandhi grahchakr modelon ke kuch tatv usee gati se ghoomte hai jis gati se surya ke chaaron ore grah ghoomte hai
 Thus it is suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on the underlying Sun-centered model, in which planets orbit the Sun
 ek samiksha main is surya kendrit vyakhya kaa vistrut khandan he
 This review BL a book by Van der Varden describes "this book is unknown about Indian home doctrine and it directly contradicts every word of Aryabhata"
 However, some people accept that Aryabhata's system stems from an earlier Sun-centered model, which he did not know
 yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki ve grahon ke maarg ko andakaar maanate the, haalaanki iske liye koi bhi praathmik sakshya prastut nahin kiya gaya he
 Although Aristarchus of Samos and sometimes Heraclides of Pontus are credited with knowledge of the Sun-centered theory, Greek astronomy known in ancient India makes no discussion of the Sun-centered theory
 bhartiya khagoleey parampara main aryabhat ke kaary kaa bada prabhaav tha or anuwaad ke madhyam se inhone kai padosi samskritiyon ko prabhavit kiya
 Its Arabic translation was particularly influential during the Islamic Golden Age
 unke kuch parinaamon ko al-khwarijmi dwaara uddhrut kiya gaya he or 10 veen sadi ke arabi vidwaan al-biruni dwaara unhen sandarbhit kiya gaya gaya he, jinhone apane varnan main likhaa he ki aryabhat ke anuyaayi maanate the ki prithvi apni dhuree par gumti he
 His definitions of sine, cosine as well as versine, and inverse sine, influenced the origin of trigonometry
 ve pehle vyakti bhi the jinhone sin or varsin talikaon ko, 0 degree se 90 degree tak 3
75 ° antaraalon main, 4 dashamalav sthanon kii sookshmata tak nirmit kiya
 In fact the modern names of "sine" and "cosine" are the incorrect pronunciation of the words sine and cosine as practiced by Aryabhata
 unhen arabi main jiba or kojiba ke rup main uccharit kiya gaya tha
 He was then misinterpreted by Gerard of Cremona during the translation of an Arabic geometry text into Latin; He took the Arabic word 'pocket' for jiba which means "a seam in a dress", el sinus
 aryabhat kii khagoleey gananaa kii vidhiyaan bhi bahut prabhaavshaalee thi
 Along with trigonometric tables, they were widely used in the Islamic world
 or anek arabi khagoleey talikaon kii gananaa ke liye istemaal kii jaati thi
 In particular, the astronomical tables found in the works of the Arabic Spain scientist al-jharkali were translated into Latin as the tables of Toledo and have been in use for centuries as the most subtle almanac in Europe
 aryabhat or unke anuyaayiyon dwaara kii gayi tithi gananaa panchang athwa hindu tithipatr nirdhaaran ke vyaavhaarik uddeshyon ke liye bharat main nirantar istemaal main rahi hai, inhe islamic duniya ko bhi preshit kiya gaya, jahaan inase jalaalee tithipatr kaa aadhaar taiyaar kiya gaya jise 1073 main umr khayyam sahit kuch khagolavidon ne prastut kiya, jiske sanskaran aaj iran or afghanistan main rashtriya calendar ke rup main prayog main hai
 The Jalali Tithipatra estimates its dates on the basis of actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata
 This type of date sheet requires an almanac to calculate the dates
 yadhyapi tithiyon kii gananaa karnaa kathin tha, par jalaalee tithipatr main gregory tithipatr se kam mausami trutiyaan thi
 India's first satellite, Aryabhata, was named after him

 An institute near Nainital in India has been named Aryabhata Observational Science Research Institute for research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences
