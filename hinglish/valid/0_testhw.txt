 This language is used extensively on various software platforms
 shaayad hi koi computer-platform ho jiske liye si kaa compiler uplabdh na ho
 The deep impact of c language can be seen on many programming languages like c ++, Java, c # etc
 san 1960 main cambridge vishvavidhyalay ne ek computer programing bhashaa kaa vikaas kiya jise unhone BASIC COMBINED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE naam diya
 It was called b in the language of common language
 ’bi’ bhashaa ko san 1972 main bell prayogshaala main computer vaigyanik danish richi dwaara sanshodhit kiya gaya
 The 'C' programming language is a modified form of the 'B' programming language
 ’si’ ko unics oparating system or dos oparating system dono main prayog kiya ja saktaa he, antar maatr compiler kaa hota he
 Unix operating system is the operating system written in 'C'

 The C-language is available as a number of sub-languages with minor differences 
 america rashtriya maanak santhaan dwaara viksit ANSI c ko adhiktar maanak mana jaataa he
 The most important feature of this programming language is that it has all the properties of a high level programming language, as well as all the properties of a low level language

 Due to the above features, 'C' is a very popular computer programming language

 Where this variable is preserved it also has a fixed address that tells where the value of the variable is preserved in memory
 is pate ko hi pointer kehete hai
 The c / c ++ programming language also has the feature that the address of a variable can be determined
 c / C++ programmen bhashaa main bhi char kaa pataa jaanane ke liye & kaa upyog karte hai
 For example, if there is an integer variable x, the address of x will match with & x
 jis prakaar purnank, akshar, vaastavik sankhya ityadi ko char main sangrakshit kiya jaataa hai usee tarah kisi char ke pattey ko bhi
 For this, a new datatype is used to preserve the address in the same way that int datatype is used to preserve integers
 kisi purnank char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye int* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 Similarly, characters use char * datatype to preserve the address of a variable

 Filmmaking is a process of filmmaking, from an initial story idea or commission, through scriptwriting, shooting, editing, directing and its distribution to the audience
 aamtaur par, isamen baari sankhya main log shaamil rahete hai or iske puraa hone main kuch maheene se lekar kuch varsh lag jate hai
 Filmmaking takes place all over the world in a vast range of economic, social and political contexts and uses a wide variety of technologies and techniques

 mul vishay ko pahchaanane yaa uske sandeshon ko rekhaankit karne ke baad nirmaataa lekhak ke saath milakar kahani kaa saransh taiyaar karata he
 They then create a step outline, dividing the entire story into one-paragraph scenes that focus on theatrical structure
 phir, ve, kahani or uske mood or paatro se sambandhit 25-30 prishth kaa ek tritment taiyaar karte hai
 It usually has short dialogue and stage direction, but often includes pictures that help guide the original points

 However, producers often skip the previous steps and develop the presented script that investors, studios and other interested parties assess through a process known as screenplay coverage
 film vitarak ko shuruuaati daur main hi sambhavit bazaar or film kii sambhavit vittiya safalataa kii samiksha ke liye sampark kiya ja saktaa he
 Hollywood distributors adopt a rigid business approach and consider elements such as film genre, target audience, historical success of similar films, actors who may appear in the film, and potential directors

 Not all movies make a profit from theatrical release, so film companies take possession of DVD sales and distribution worldwide
 nirmaataa or patakatha lekhak film pich yaa tritment taiyaar karte hai or ise sambhavit niveshkon ke saamne prastut karte hai
 If the pitch is successful, the film receives a "green light", meaning some people provide financial support which means: usually a large film studio, film council or independent investor
 The connected parties negotiate and sign an agreement

 Many Hollywood major films employ hundreds of cast and crew, while a low-budget and independent film can be made with a minimum number of personnel of eight or nine
 ye sabhi vishisht padon ke chaalak dal hote hai: In production, video / film is made and shot

 Shooting for a specific day begins with the crew arriving at the scheduled time / location called
 abhinaytaon ke aamtaur par apane alag kol samay hote hai
 Since set construction, dressing and lighting can take hours or even a day, they are often prepared well in advance
 greep, bijli or utpaadan dizin chaalak dal aamtaur par camera or dhwani vibhaagon se ek kadam aage rahete hai: dakshata kii khatir, jabaki ek drishy filmaaya ja rahaa hota he, ve pehle se hi agle kii taiyaari kar rahe hote hai

 abhinayta nirdeshak ke saath bandha kar patakatha kaa abhyaas karte hai or camera or dhwani chaalak dal bhi unke saath abhyaas karte hai or antim twek kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Finally, the action is shot in multiple screens to suit the director's wishes
 zyaadaatar america production ek vishesh prakriya kaa paalan karte hai: The Assistant Director calls "picture is Up" to inform everyone that the Tech Record is about to happen
 or uske baad "kwit ebhrivan" kahata he
 Once everyone is ready to shoot, he calls out "roll Round" and the production sound mixer turns on his instruments, records and announces a verbal slat of tech notifications
 " Sound speed "when they are ready

 claper, jo pehle se hi clepboard ke saat camere ke saamne hota he, kahata he "marker!" or jatke se band karata he
 If the take involves extra or background action, Eddie queues it and at the end is the director who gives the actors "action!" Says jab nirdeshak "cat!" kahata he, ek tech samaapt ho jaataa he or camera or dhwani recording roak dete hai
 The script supervisor notes any continuity issues and the sound and camera teams record technical comments on their respective sheets
 agar nirdeshak yah faisla karata he ki atirikt tekon kii jarurat he to puri prakriya phir se duharai jaati he
 When he is satisfied, the crew moves on to the next camera angle or "setup," until the entire scene is "covered
" When shooting for a scene is finished the assistant director is a " Rap "or" moving on "and the crew pauses or dismantles the set of the scene
 din ke ant main, nirdeshak agle din kii shooting shedul kii manjuuri detaa he or ek dainik pragati report nirmaan karyaalay ko bhej di jaati he
 It includes report sheets of continuity, sound and camera teams

 doordaraj ke sthanon main 14 yaa 18 ghante tak chalane vaale kaary diwason ke saath, film nirmaan ek team bhaavana paidaa karata he
 When the entire film is in a state of completion or the end of the production phase, the production office by convention organizes a wrap party to thank all the cast and crew
 yahan video / film sampadak dwaara video / film ekatrit kii jaati he
 The modern utility of video in the filmmaking process has resulted in two variants: one entirely using film and the other using a mixture of film and video
 film ke kaary main, mul camera film ko viksit or ek yantric editing mashin se sampadan karne ke liye ek van-lite varkaprint main copy kii jaati he
 An edge code is recorded in the film to indicate the position of the picture frame
 avid yaa final cat pro jaise non-lenior sampadan vyavastha ke viksit hone ke baad se, kuch produkshnon ke dwaara hi film workelo kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In the video workflow, the original camera negative is developed and telesigned for editing with computer editing software
 pikchar frem kii sthiti ko loket karne ke liye video main ek timecode record kiya jaataa he
 During this process the production sound is also enhanced along with the video picture frame
 film sampadak kaa pehla kaam vyaktigat "tex" par aadhaarit sequence se liye gaye raf cat ko nirmit karnaa hota he
 The purpose of rough cut is to choose the best shot and decorate it in order
 nirdeshak aamtaur par yah sunishchit karne ke liye kii anuroop shots kaa chayan kiya jaay, sampadak ke saath kaam karata he
 The next step is to create a fine cut through all the scenes so that it can flow seamlessly with an unbroken story
 trimming, kuch secondon main drishyon ko chhaantane kii ek prakriya, yaa frem bhi, isi charan ke dauraan hota he
 After the final cut is selected and approved by the director and producer, the film is "locked", which means that no changes will be made to it now
 Next, the editor automatically or manually creates a negative cut list or an edit decision list
 ye sampadan suchiyaan fine cat main prayek drishy ke pikchar frem ke strot kii pahchaan karti hai
 Once the picture is locked, it is handed over to the Sound Department's Postproduction Sound Supervision Editor to produce the sound track
 aawaaj recording ko sincranaise kiya jaataa he or ri-recording mixr ke dwaara antim dhwani mishran taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Sound mixing includes dialogue, sound effects, atmos, ADR, walla, follage and music
 dhwani trek or pikchar ko ek saath yukt kiya jaataa he or yah film main nimna gunvattta ansar print kaa parinaam he
 Now depending on the recording medium, there are two possible workflows for producing high quality release prints: ant main saamaanya rup se lakshith darshakon ke dwaara film kaa purvavlokan kiya jaataa he or pratikriyaaon ke aadhaar par aage kii shooting or sampadan kiya ja saktaa he
 There can be two ways to put a film together
 ek rasta rekhiy sampadan or anya gaiyr rekhiy sampadan kaa he
 Linear editing uses film as if it is a continuous film
 film ke sabhi bhaag pehle se hi kram main hote hai or unhen idhar-udhar le jane kii yaa karne kii jarurat nahin hoti
 In contrast, taped sequence is not taken into consideration in non-linear editing
 drishy chaaron ore ghumaae ja sakate hai yaa hataa bhi die jate hai
 This is the final stage, where the film is released in theaters or, sometimes in a consumer medium, or downloaded directly from the provider
 cinemagharon main vitaran kii jarurat ke hisaab se film ko anulipit kiya jaataa he
 Press kits, posters and other advertising material are published and the film is promoted

 The distribution rights for film and DVD are also generally sold for worldwide distribution
 vitarak or production company laabh ko aapas main baantati he
 Filmmaking also occurs outside the mainstream and is commonly called independent filmmaking
 divi praudyogiki kii shuruuaat ke baad se production ke saadhan or adhik ganatantric ho gaye hai
 Filmmakers can potentially shoot and edit the film, create and edit sound and music, and mix the final cut on their home computer
 haalanki, production ke saadhan bhale hi ganatantric ho jaayan, nivesh, paaramparik vitaran or marketing ke kaaran paaramparik vyavastha se baahar janaa bahut kathin he
 In the past, most independent filmmakers relied on film festivals to focus on their film and sell it for distribution
 baharhaal, internet ne swatantra filmon ke vitaran kaa apekshaakrit sasta madhyam sulabh karaayaa he
 As a result, many companies have risen to assist filmmakers to showcase independent films and sell them in mainstream Internet markets, even many popular Hollywood films
 With digital self-distribution, independent filmmakers, who had failed to garner a traditional distribution deal, have the ability to reach a global audience

 Its structure is very scientific and the language is very concise and simple
 isamen chaar adhyyon main 123 shloke hai
 Aryabhatiya starts from the Dasagitika pad
 iske chaar adhyay is prakaar hai : 1
 das-geetika-pad 2
 ganit-paad - khagoleey achar tathaa jya-sarini ; gananaaon ke liye aavashyak ganit 3
 kaal-kriya-pad - Time-division and rules for calculating the position of planets 4
 gol-paad - trikoshmetiya samasyaon ke hal ke liye niyam; grahan kii gananaa Geetikapada is the smallest, of only 13 verses, but a lot of material has been filled in it
 iske liye inhone aksharo dwaara sankshep main sankhya likhane kii swanirmit ek anokhi reeti kaa vyavhaar kiya he, jisamen vyajanno se saral sankhyaayein or swaron se shunya kii ginati suchit kii jaati thi
 For example khyughri = 43,20,000 main 2 ke liye kh likhaa gaya he or 30 ke liye y
 Both letters are written together and contain a quantity of U, which is the same as 10,000; Hence Khu means 3,20,000; The meaning of Ghrit means 4 and the meaning of r is 10,00,000, hence Ghrit means 40,00,000
 In this way, the above value of blood is obtained
 sankhya likhane kii is reeti main sabase bada dosha yah he ki yadi aksharon main thodaa sa bhi her pher ho jaay to badi baari bhul ho sakati he
 The second drawback is that if the amount of r is applied in L, its form is the same as that of the vowel, but there is a big difference in the meanings of the two
 in dosha ke hote hue bhi is pranali ke liye aryabhat kii pratibha kii prashansa kerani hi padati he
 In this, he has written many things in a few verses; Literally, the ocean is filled in Gagar

 One thing to note here is that Aryabhata also gave the number of rotations of the Earth in a Mahayuga, as he considered the daily rotation of the Earth
 is baat ke liye parvarti acharya brahmagupta ne inaki ninda kii he
 In the next verse, the number of planetary highs and the great epochs of the path is mentioned

 In the next seven verses, the relationship of the zodiac, fraction, art, etc
, the expansion of the sky, the magnitude of the diameter of the Earth and the diameter of the Sun, the Moon and the planets, the revolution and deflection of the planets, the locations of their addresses and scales, their dims and There is a table of values of the spheres at a difference of 3 degrees 45 arts and the magnitude of the gaps

 The shlokas next to it include square area, cube, square root, cube root, area of triangle, cube of triangular cone, area of circle, circle cube, distance and area of parallel arms from the property of the hypotenuse of trapezoidal area and area of all types
 By knowing the medium length and width, simple rules for giving area are given
 ek jagah bataaya gaya he ki paridhi ke chathe bhaag ko jya uski trigya ke samaan hoti he
 The verse states that if the diameter of the circle is 20,000 then its circumference is 62,832
 isse paridhi or vyas kaa sambandh chauthe dashamalav sthaan tak shuddh aa jaataa he
 The two verses describe the method of finding the volumes, which shows how Aryabhata made the table of the blocks

 This is the last chapter of Aryabhatiya
 isamen 50 shloke hai

 Head south to the end of Pisces
 aage ke do shlokon main bataaya gaya he ki grahon ke paat or prithvi kii chaaya kaa bhraman krantivrutt par hota he

 are visible
 paanchavaan shloke bataata he ki prithvi, grahon or nakshatron kaa aadha gola apni hi chaaya se prakashit he or aadha surya ke sanmukh hone se prakashit he

 The term bimbo is commonly used in the English language for a woman who is physically attractive but who is stupid or under-educated
 The term can also be used to describe a woman who behaves sexually indiscriminately
 is shabd kaa prayog 1919 main sanyukt rajya america main kiya jane laga, jahaan iskaa istemaal ek murkh yaa pashavik purush ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 In 1929 it was first included in an official dictionary for its feminine meaning, in which it was defined as "a woman"
 bimbo shabd ko aksar rudhiwaadi "dam blond" or "vaili girl" yaa newjiland "shor girl" ke saath joda jaataa he, lekin yah inase alag he
 In English the term bimbo was first used for a foolish male, although it is now commonly used to refer to a woman unless it is converted to male bimbo or himbo
 To illustrate this, its explicitly female version Bimbet, sometimes used, has also been recorded in The American Heritage Dictionary
 bimabet kaa istemaal ek chote bimbo ke liye kiya jaataa he, chunki uske saath pratyay -ait ek chote sanskaran kaa pratik he
 In popular English, the word bimbo can have two similar meanings
 pehla ek murkh or alp shikshit aakarshak mahila ko sanderbhit karata he, jabaki doosraa kam yon niyantran vaali or yon rup se anek dhang se vyavhaar karne vaali mahilaon ko sanderbhit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 After cosmetic surgery is popularized, a person who gets it done to increase their perceived attractiveness can also be referred to as bimbo
 haalanki purv main bimbo shabd kaa istemaal ek apmanjanak shabd ke rup main kiya jaataa tha, haal ke varshon main is shabd ko apane saath ek vishesh lakshan liye hue vyakti ko vargeekrut karne ke liye ek adhik tatasth shabd ke rup main parivartit kiya gaya
 Such a situation has arisen mainly in the context of celebrities, especially models and actors, some of whom can be referred to as bimbo in the media without even an incompatible meaning
 ise badalte vichaaron ke saath hi saath un adhyayan kaa bhi samarthan mila, jiske anusaar yah pataa chalaa he ki ek bimbo ko murkh yaa alpashikshit mana jane ke kaaran, ve iske bajaay anya kshetron, yaa to shaareerik yaa saamaajik, main bharpai karne kii koshish karenge
 yah is baat se jhalkata he ki kaise bimbo naam ke saath judi visheshtaon vaali ek mahila kaa adhik sthai or safal sambandh banane ki adhik sambhaavna hoti he taaki ve apni or bhavishya main hone vaale apane bacchon kii jivan style ko sudhaar sake
 Due to the term being associated with people in popular culture, the common-feeling Bimbo form became that of a beautiful blonde woman with a beautiful snip texture and big breasts, who often put on a lot of make-up and wore open-ended clothes
 is
 is aam dharna ke baavjood, tathaapi, kisi vyakti ko bimbo maane jane ke liye uparokt main se kisi bhi lakshan kaa hona anivaary nahin he
 The common inclusion of blonde is due to the traditional European belief that blonde is beautiful and the "dum blonde" stereotype as an extension
 yah shabd italvi shabd bimbo se vyutpann hua he, jo ek puling shabd bambino se vyutpann hua he or jiskaa arth he baccha yaa bahut chota baccha )
 is shabd kaa prayog 1919 main sanyukt rajya america main shuru hua tha or yah murkh yaa pashavik purush ko varnit karne ke liye istemaal kiya jane vaala kathboli shabd tha
 The term bimbo was not associated with women until the 1930s
 1929 kii ek mook film desert nit main ek dhani badmaash mahila ko bimbo kah kar varnit kiya gaya or di broadway melody main basi lav gusse main ek kores ladki ko bimbo kah kar sambodhit karti he
 The use of its feminine meaning was first included in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1929, taken from the scholarly journal American Speech where it is commonly referred to as "a woman"
 haalanki maujuuda arth ke saath is shabd kaa hameshaa hi nakaaratmak lakshyarth hota he, haal ke varshon main iske apmanjanak gunon ko kam kiya gaya he taaki "bimbo" ko ek adhik tatasth shabd banaaya ja sake
 isane aakarshak lekin murkh yaa yon rup se aniyantrit mahilaon ke rup main apane paribhaasha ko barkaraar rakhaa, lekin media, jaise mahilaon kii patrikaon or gapshap patrikaon main is shabd ko visisth rup se nakaaratmak style main prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead it is used primarily to include common features associated with bimbo and to classify a person as a bimbo
 19veen or 20veen shatabdi ke dauraan germany main, "bimbo " shabd ek africa mul ke vyakti ke liye ek jatvaad shabd ke rup main dwiarthi tha
 The term is rarely used, however, in relation to its original meaning
 haalanki kabhi-kabhi yah shabd "bimbo" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, judaa hua lekin alag vaakyansh, jaise jaise" "damme blondine " adhik aam he

 Surah Mohsin has translated this sura into English: al-iftiyaarishwar ke naam par, jo dayavan he:- When Jannat breaks into pieces; When stars fall apart and disintegrate; And when the seas burst forth; And when the graves are overturned, the inner ones come out; Then a person comes to know what has been sent with him and what is left behind, o man! What is it that has made you careless to that generous God of yours? Who saved you, gave you this perfect figure and gave you your authorized share; In whatever form He willed, He put you together
 Nay! But you deny the ad-din
 But verily, over you to watch you, Kirâman Kâtibîn writing down, They know all that you do
 Verily, the Abrâr will be in Delight ; And verily, the Fujjâr will be in the blazing Fire, Therein they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense, And they will not be absent therefrom
 And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? the Day when no person shall have power anything for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be with Allâh
