 shakti electronic ke kaaran vidyut urja ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan hue hai
 Today, drives are available to drive motors ranging from 10 watts to several hundred megawatts
 6 jigawatt tak kii vidyut shakti lagbhag 1000 kilovolt ke ucch-voltata disi pareshan ke madhyam se transmit kii ja sakati he
 Trains, elevators, and cranes are all running smoothly through power electronics
 akshay urja ke sroton ke vidyut grid se jodne main shakti electronic kaa hi haath he
 Even radar systems rely on power electronics
 yadhyapi shakti electraniki main chote-mote sabhi electronic avyav prayukt hote hai, kintu nimnlikhit avyavay shakti electraniki ke vishishti pahchaan hai- Work in the field of power electronics was preceded by miniature-signal electronics
 sabase pehle vidyut shakti ke niyantran tathaa parivartan ke liye vidyut mashiinon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 This was followed by the Mercury Arc Rectifier
 tatpashchaat nirvaat evam gas-bhare vaalvon kaa yug aayaa
 The development of SCR in 1957 gave a new direction to Shakti Electronics
 aajkal esasiaar, jitio, bijetti, mossphate, aijibiti aadi swichon ke prayog se atyant dakshata purvak vidyut-shakti kaa parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Due to this, the field of power electronics has become very wide and important
 electraniki vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag he jisamen electron naliyon kaa athwa usee tarah kaa kaary karne vaale ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti ko vaanchit voltata, aavriti, dhara main dakshatapurvak badla jaataa he
 The fact is that electric power is used very rarely in the form we receive
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi udyog ko vidyut shakti 415 volt, 50 hertz asi ke rup main milti he
 It has to be electrocuted for which 0 to 20 volts DC is required, from which zero to 1200 ampere current will flow
 spasht he ki hamen jo vidyut praapt ho rahi he use sidhe is kaary ke liye upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, balki use badalanaa padegaa
 This work is done by Shakti Electronics
 vastav main aise hajaaron udhaaharan hai jahaan vidyut shakti ko jyon kaa tyon upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa balki kisi duusare rup main badalanaa padataa he
 Important uses of electronic devices are: aajkal ke kai atiprachlit yantra bhi bina electraniki ke ban nahin pate, jaise radio, doordarshan, chalchitr, pratidipti prakaash, jan-vyaakhyaan-pranali, telephone aadi
 All these tips are the result of electronics
 electraniki ke kuch audyogic upyogon ke vishay main sankshep main neeche likh ja rahaa he : Inductors are often used in industries, by which the alternating current is converted into a specified current
 ve praaia: nimnlikhit main se ek prakaar ke hote hai : The use of multicomponent circuitous circuits in high power compensation is more profitable for several reasons than neglecting the use of single circuitry circuits
 pratham kaaran yah he ki aajkal vidyutiya shakti kaa utpaadan tathaa vitaran tri-kala-shakti ke rup main hota he
 The second reason is that the voltage generated by the polynomial bifurcation is more even than the voltage produced by the single bifurcation
 uparyukt ucchashakti rujukari main yaa to anek dhanagron ke liye ek hi runagra rahata he yaa anek dhanagar rujukari, jinke runagra jude rahete hai, prayog main laae jate hai

 motor kii chaal kaa niyantran kaagaj ke milon main vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki chaal par hi kaagaj kii motaai nirbhar rahati he
 In these devices, the electric current of the exciter field is changed, which produces the controlling area for the generator
 yah janitr ek prime mover dwaara chaalit hota he
 The armature of the generator gives its output to the motor whose speed has to be controlled
 ek dashti-dhara-janitr is motor dwaara chalaaya jaataa he; vah apni chaal ke samaanupaat main voltata utpann karata he
 If that voltage is different from predetermined voltage then it activates a regulator
 yah niamak iksiter ke kshetra main aisa parivartan laa detaa he ki motor kii chaalu purvanishchit maan par aa jaae
 Many tubes are used in this regulator
 is prakaar electraniki kii sahaayta se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran atisookshm maan tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Industrial Uses of High Frequency Heating - Extremely powerful high frequency generators are being used a lot in heating by cross electrification and motivation
 jab kisi parvidyut ko sandharitra ke do patton ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or sandharitra ko ek shaktishaalee ucch aavriti utpaadak se sambhddha kar diya jaataa he, to ek hanidhara ke kaaran parvidyut kaa taap bad jaataa he or hawa pighalane lagata he
 This type of rule is also for heating by inspiration
 ye yuktiyaan saadhaaran garam karne kii apeksha adhik laabhadaayak hai
 Electricity is used a lot in the industry to heat objects
 is vidhi se kaary bahut svachh hota he tathaa khuli hui jwaala upasthit nahin rahati
 The method of heating metals is called induction-heating and the method of heating non-conductive materials is called electro-heating
 in donon vidhiyon ke liye ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wrap a coil around the piece of metal to be heated and alternating current in it
 vidyut-pravaah se utpann chumbakeey syand vaayu main se tathaa kundali ke sameep upasthit dhaatu main se bhi hokar jaataa he
 The reversal of the current also changes the wind, which causes the voltage in the metal to be induced
 is voltata ke kaaran dhaatu main adhik maatra main bhanvar dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he
 The heat is then generated due to the resistance of the metal
 vidyut se achaalak padaarthon ko tapt karne ke liye 1,000 kilocycle yaa 1 megacicle se adhik aavriti kii shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since current cannot flow through the object, the object is placed between high-voltage metal plates
 vidyut kshetra ke teevr parivartan ke kaaran achaalak vastu kii anu-saranchana main bhi vaise hi parivartan hone lagate hai
 Due to friction between molecules, the same temperature is produced everywhere in the object
 is vidhi se achaalak vastuon kii moti chaadaron ko bahut thode samay main tapt kiya ja saktaa he
 They can be compacted by moving high currents in two pieces of metal, ie, the machine has a capacitance converter, which converts 1 to 10 voltmeters from between two electrical currents of 220 or 440 volts
 And at the same time gives high electrification
 sandhan karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki dhara kaa pravaah alp samay ke liye hi ho
 a contact-circuit is used by this
 yah yukti paripath ko sheeghra-sheeghra jodatii or todatii rahati he
 The contact-circuit uses an electron tube called the "ignitron"
 ignitron ek vishesh prakaar kii gas-yukt nalee hoti he, jo ucch vidyut-dhara ko sanbhaal sakati he
 Its use is similar to a thyratron tube

 The historical work that he did by turning the dice of the imperialist ruler of Turkey, Sultan Abdul Hameed II, to create a wonderful social, political and economic system, proved his name worthwhile
 kamaal pasha kaa janm 19 may san 1881 main salonika ke ek kisaan parivaar main hua tha
 His mother's name was Juvaida and father's Ali Raza
 ali raja salonika ke chungi daftar main clerk the
 His childhood name was Mustafa
 janm ke kuch varsh baad hi pita kii mrityu ho gayi
 Mata Zubaida entered the madrasa for the purpose of getting a religious education, where she got down on killing her after harassing her senior students
 maatr 11 saal kii umr main hi vah itane durdant ho gayi the ki unhen maktab se nikaalnaa padaa
 He was later admitted to the Sainik School in Monastir
 parantu vahaan bhi unka mar mitane vaala ugravadi swabhaav bana rahaa lekin sainya-shiksha main dilchaspee ke kaaran unki padhai badastoor jari rahi, usamen koi vyavdhaan nahin aayaa
 The child Mustafa was fierce but his speed in mathematics was surprising
 adhyaaapak ke blike board par sawaal likhte hi vah use munhajbani hal kar diya karata tha
 Seeing the amazing ability in it, the school's mathematics teacher Captain Mustafa Ufendi changed his name to Kamal
 uske baad hi vah kamaal pasha ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After receiving his initial military education at the primary military school in Monastir at the age of 17, he was sent to the Staff College of Kustuntunia for higher military education
 un dinon kustuntuniya main abdul hamid kii sultanate thi or uske rajiadhipati ko sultan kaha jaataa tha
 There he roamed in bad company along with studies
 kuch kaal tak uddandtapurna jivan bitaane ke baad vah vatan naamak ek gupt krantikari dal ke pehle sadsy bane or thode hi dinon baad uske netaa ho gayi
 The purpose of Vatan was to eradicate the dictatorship of the Sultan on the one hand and foreign intrigues on the other
 ek din dal kii baithak chal rahi thi ki kisi guptchar ne sultan ko khabar de di or sabake sab shadyantrakari afasar giraftaar karke jail bhej diye gayi
 According to the prevailing law, all of them could be given the death penalty, but the ill-fated Sultan feared that rebellion would not erupt in the country, so he decided to grant pardon to all
 is prakaar anya sanikon ke saath kamaal bhi kshamaadaan main chhod diye gayi
 Subsequently, the Sultan sent him to Damascus to suppress the rebellion of the Druze caste
 vahaan kamaal ne kaam to kamaal kaa hi kiya, par swabhaav ke anusaar kustantuniya waapas lautate hi unhone stambul main ek cameraa lekar vatan-o-hurriyat party kaa karyaalay kholkar usamen aazaadee kii gupt sanstha kaa kaary armbh kar diya
 Meanwhile, he came to know that there was going to be an open rebellion against the Sultan in Macedonia
 maukey kii najaakat ko bhaanpate hue kamaal ne sultan kii sena se chuttee le lee or jaafaa, miru va athens hote hue vesh badalakar vidroh ke kendra salonika ja pahunche
 But they were recognized there
 phir vah greece hote hue jaafaa kii ore bhaage
 But by then the order of his arrest had reached there too
 ahamed be naamak ek afasar par kamaal ko pakadaney kaa bhaar tha, par chunki ahamed swayan vatan kaa sadsy tha, isliye usne kamaal ko giraftaar karne ke bajaay gaja morche par bhej diya or yah sultan ko yah report bhej di ki vah chuttee par gayi hi nahin the
 Although Kamal was able to stay in Salonika for a very short time, he understood well that it would be better to make Salonika the center of rebellion, so after a lot of efforts, in 1908 he got Salonika transferred
 yahan anwar ke netritv main do saal pehle hi ekta or pragati samiti ke naam se ek krantikari dal kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 Kamal immediately became its member, but she was not made up of the leaders of the party
 phir bhi ve samiti kaa kaam nirantar karte rahe
 One leader of this party, Niazi, revolted against the Turkish government with only a few hundred men
 yadhyapi thi to yah badi morrkhtaa kii baat, parantu chunki sara desh taiyaar tha, isliye jo sena usase ladane ke liye bheji gayi thi, vah bhi anwar se ja mili
 Thus Anwar cheered in the country
 ab sah sammilit sena rajdhani par akraman karne kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 The Sultan also made some governance reforms in those days
 phir bhi vidroh kii shaktiyaan apana kaam karti raheen, par jab vidroh safal ho chukaa tab sultan abdul hamid ne sena ke kuch logon ko yathesht ghoose dekar apane saath mila liya, jisase sainikon ne vidroh karke apane afasaron ko maar daalaa or phir ek baar islam, sultan or khaliph kii jai ke naare buland hue
 Anwar was in Berlin these days
 vah jaldi hi laute or unhone abdul hamid ko gaddi se utaar kar anek pratikriyaavaadi netaaon kii phaansi par chadha diya
 In this way administrative power came into the hands of Anwar's revolutionary committee
 aam janata ko digbhramit karne ke liye sultan ke bhanje ko singhaasana par bitha diya gaya
 Here Kamaal Pasha continued to plot against Anwar because in his view Anwar was undoubtedly idealistic but more impractical
 baavjood is sabake anwar ne us samay hone vaale videshi akramanon ko ek ke baad ek lagaataar vifal kiya isse janata main anwar kii khyaati or adhik badi
 Anwar then embarked on the task of making his all-islamic dream come true and the first thing he did for it was to hand over the responsibility of organizing the Turkish army to a German general
 kamaal ne iske viruddh yah kehete hue aandolan prarambh kiya ki yah to turki jati kaa apmaan he
 On this, Kamal was sent to Sofia by making a military ambassador
 isi bich mahayuddh chhid gaya
 Anwar could not succeed in this, but Kamal thwarted the British trick of conquering Kustantunia in a battle, and then his victory continued to prevail
 phir bhi mahayuddh main turki haar gaya
 Working hard day and night, he kept agitating against foreigners
 1920 main sevra kii sandhi kii ghoshnaa hui parantu isaki sharten itani kharaab thim ki kamaal ne fouran hi ek sena taiyaar kar kustuntuniya par akraman kii taiyaari kii
 Meanwhile, Greece attacked Turkey and launched an army at Smyrna which started moving towards the great center of Angara
 ab to kamaal ke liye badi samasya paidaa ho gai, kyonki is yuddh main yadi ve haar jate to aage koi sambhaavna na rahati
 So they fought the war with great preparation, as a result of which the Greek army gradually had to retreat
 is bich france or rus ne bhi kamaal ko gupt rup se sahaayta dena shuru kiya
 In a few days the Greeks were driven out
 greekon ko bhagane ke baad hi angrejon ke haath se baaki hisse nikaalane kaa prashn tha
 The country was with them, in addition, Britain was no longer ready to fight
 is kaaran yah samasya bhi sulajh gai
 Kamal declared the country democratic and became the first President himself
 ab rajya lagbhag nishkantak ho chukaa tha, par mullaon kii ore se unka nirantar virodh ho rahaa tha
 Kamal started campaigning against Islam in government newspapers
 ab to dharmik netaaon ne unke viruddh fatve jari kar diye or yah kahana shuru kiya ki kamaal ne angora main striyon ko parde se baahar nikaal kar desh main aadhunik nrity kaa prachaar kiya he, jisamen purush striyon se satakar naachte hai, iskaa ant hona chahie
 This voice was raised from every mosque
 tab kamaal ne 1924 ke march main khilaafat pratha kaa ant kiya or turki ko dharm-nirpeksh raashtra ghoshit karte hue ek vidheyak sansad main rakhaa
 Most parliamentarians opposed it, but Kamal threatened them with a tight end
 unki is dhamkee kaa purajor asar hua or vidheyak paarit ho gaya
 But the fire of insurgency within the mullahs kept on burning
 kamaal ke kai bhootpurv saathi mullaon ke saath mil gayi the
 These people also took money from foreign capitalists
 kamaal ne ek din inke mukhya netaaon ko giraftaar kar phaansi par chadha diya
 Kamal saw that hanging only will not do, the country has to be educated modernly and not only the old customs and attire but also the dress etc
 have to be abolished
 kamaal ne pehla hamalaa turki topi par kiya
 It revolted, but Kamal sent an army
 iske baad inhone islamic kanoonon ko hataakar unke sthaan par ek nai samhita sthapit kii jisamen switzarland, germany or italy kii sab acchhee-acchhee baaten shaamil thim
 Multiple marriages were outlawed
 iske saath hi patiyon se yah kaha gaya ki ve apni patniyon ke saath dhoron kii tarah-vyavhaar na karke barabari kaa bartaav rakhen
 Everyone was given the right to vote

 Vande Mataram bankimachandra chattopadhyaay dwaara sanskrit bangla mishrit bhashaa main rachit is geet kaa prakaashan san 1882 main unke upanyaas anand math main anternihit geet ke rup main hua tha
 In this novel, this song is sung by a monk named Bhawanand
 isaki dhun yadunath bhattacharya ne banaayi thi
 In 2003, in an international survey conducted by BBC World Service, in which around 7,000 songs were selected from around the world to select the ten most famous songs of the time, and according to BBC, people from 155 countries / islands had it
 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland

 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga

 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896

 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved

 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 This festival is also known as 'herath' or 'herath' every night and colloquially in Kashmir Shaivism
 mahashivaratri se sambadhit kai puranic kathayen he: On the day of Mahashivaratri, Lord Shiva kept a poison named Kalkut in his throat
 jo samudr manthan ke samay baahar aayaa tha
 Once Parvati ji asked Lord Shiva Shankar, 'what is the best and simple fast-worship, from which the beings of the dead land get your grace easily?' In reply, Shivji told this story by telling Parvati to observe the fast of 'shivratri' - 'once there was a hunter named Chitrabhanu
 pashuon kii hatya karke vah apane kutumb ko paalataa tha
 He was indebted to a moneylender, but could not repay his loan on time
 krodhit sahuukaar ne shikari ko shivamath main bandi bana liya
 Coincidentally it was Shivratri that day
 ' The hunter meditated and kept listening to religious things related to Shiva
 chaturdashi ko usne shivaratri vrath kii katha bhi suni
 Just before dusk, the moneylender called him to him and talked about repaying the loan
 shikari agle din sara rin lautaa dene kaa vachan dekar bandhan se chhot gaya
 Like his daily routine he went out hunting in the forest
 lekin dinabhar bandi grih main rahane ke kaaran bhukh-pyaas se vyakul tha
 To hunt, he started making a halt on the vine tree on the banks of a pond
 bel vriksh ke neeche shivlinga tha jo vilvapatron se dhakaa hua tha
 Hunter could not find the person
 padaav banaate samay usne jo tahaniyaan todin, ve sanyog se shivlinga par giriin
 In this way, fasting and thirsty hunters were also fasted throughout the day and bell-sheets were also climbed on the Shivling
 ek pahar raatri biit jane par ek garbhini mrigi talab par pani pine pahunchi
 As soon as the hunter drew an arrow on the bow, the antelope said, 'I am pregnant
 sheeghra hi prasav karuungi
 You will kill two creatures simultaneously, which is not right
 main bachche ko janm dekar sheeghra hi tumhaare samaksh prastut ho jaaoongi, tab maar lenaa
 The hunter loosened the cross and the deer disappeared into the wild bushes
 kuch hi der baad ek or mrigi udhar se nikali
 The hunter was over the moon
 sameep aane par usne dhanush par baan chadhaaya
 Seeing him, the deer politely pleaded, 'O Pardhi! i retired from the season a while ago
 kamaatur virahinee hum
 i am wandering in search of my beloved main apane pati se milakar sheeghra hi tumhaare paas aa jaaoongi
 ' The hunter let him go as well
 do baar shikaar ko khokar uskaa maathaa thanka
 He was in all sort of thoughts
 raatri kaa aakhri pahar biit rahaa tha
 Then another antelope escaped with her children
 shikari ke liye yah svarnim avasar tha
 He did not take long to shoot arrows at the bow
 vah tir chhodane hi vaala tha ki mrigi boli, 'he pardhi!' main in bacchon ko inke pita ke hawaale karke laut aauungi
 Do not kill me this time
 shikari hansaa or bolaa, saamne aae shikaar ko chhod duun, main aisa murkh nahin
 i have lost my prey twice before
 mere bachche bhukh-pyaas se tadap rahe honge
 In response, the deer again said, as you are maltreating your children, just like me too
 isliye sirf bacchon ke naam par main thodi der ke liye jeevandaan maang rahi hum
 Hey Pardhi! Trust me, i promise to leave them to their father and return immediately
 mrigi kaa deen swar sunakar shikari ko us par dayaa aa gai
 He let that chicken escape too
 shikaar ke abhaav main bel-vrikshapar baitha shikari belptr tod-todakar neeche phenkata ja rahaa tha
 When the dawn broke, a strong deer came on the same path
 shikari ne soch liya ki iskaa shikaar vah avashya karegaa
 Seeing the trunk of the hunter, he said in a loud voice, o brother! If you have killed three antelopes and small children coming before me, do not delay in killing me, so that i do not have to suffer even a single moment in their disconnection
 main un mrigiyon kaa pati hum
 If you have given them life, please give me some life too
 main unase milakar tumhaare samaksh upasthit ho jaaoongaa
 As soon as he heard the deer, the whole night cycle happened in front of the hunter, he narrated the whole story to the deer
 tab mrug ne kaha, 'meri teenon patniyaan jis prakaar pratigyabaddh hokar gai hai, meri mrityu se apane dharm kaa paalan nahin kar paaengi
 So, just as you have left him as a confidant, let me also go
 main un sabake saath tumhaare saamne sheeghra hi upasthit hota hum
 'fasting, night-awakening and climbing the bell leaf on the Shivling, the violent heart of the hunter was purged
 usamen bhagavad shakti kaa vaas ho gaya tha
 The bow and arrow were easily left from his hand
 bhagwaan shiv kii anukanpa se uskaa hinsak hriday kaarunik bhaavon se bhar gaya
 He started burning in the flame of repentance remembering his past deeds
 thodi hi der baad vah mrug sapariwaar shikari ke samaksh upasthit ho gaya, taaki vah unka shikaar kar sake, kintu junglee pashuon kii aisi satyata, satviktaa evam samuhik prembhaavana dekhakar shikari ko badi glani hui
 There was a burst of tears from his eyes
 us mrug parivaar ko na markar shikari ne apane kathor hriday ko jeev hinsa se hataa sadaa ke liye komal evam dayaalu bana liya
 All the Dev Samaj from Devalok were also watching this event

 Then the hunter and antelope family attained moksha '

 • Shiva Purana • Shiva • Gangaur carburator ek aisi yantric yukti he jo aantarik dahan ingine ke liye hawa or drav eendhan ko mishrit karti he
 It was invented by Carl Benz before 1885
 baad main 1886 main ise patent bhi karaayaa gaya
 Karl Benz is the founder of Mercedes Benz
 iskaa adhik vikaas hungary ke abhiyantric jainor soenska or donat banki ne 1893 main kiya tha
 
 Fredrik William Lancaster of Birmingham, England tested the carburetor on cars and in 1896 he made England's first petrol car with his brother
 is car main ek hi silinder 8 horse power kaa anterdahan ingine chen drive ke sang laga tha
 The very next year he brought it out with a new carburetor design with two horizontal resistor cylinders
 is praturup ne varsh 1900 main 1000 mile kii duuri nirvighn tay kii
 The term carburetor derives from the French word carbure, meaning carbide
 eendhan rasiniki ke anusaar, carburator eendhan main carbon kii maatra ko vashpashil hydrocarbon se kriya karne ke baad badhaata he
 Generally, it works by mixing the fuel in the air
 1980 ke kuch varshon baad tak yah yukti eendhan ke dahan kii praathmik yukti hua karti thi, kintu fyaal injection pranali ke aane or badhate prayog ke kaaran carburator kaa prayog kaaphi kam hua he
 Yet it is still used in motorcycles etc
 carburator ek nalee kaa bana hota he, jiske santulan hetu ek pattee lagi hoti he
 This leaf is called a throttle plate
 yah plate vaayu ke bahaav kaa niyantran karke santulan banaati he
 This throttle-plate controls the ratio of air to fuel mixed when the engine is started
 carburator ke sankare bhaag, jise ventury kehete hai; main lage ek jet se nirvaat ke dwaara eendhan ko khinchaa jaataa he
 The speed of this fuel is controlled by the pressure of the air present there
 yah bernoli ke siddhant ke anusaar hota he
 The carburetor works on the same principle
 yahi carburator yadi vaayu or eendhan ke anupaat main gadabad karne lage, to ingine ke start hone main samasya aa jaati he
 When this ratio is high, the engine does not work, stops, or is unable to start
 yahi anupaat bahut kam hone par ingine kharaab hone kaa khatra bhi hota he
 In cold environments, the fuel hardly evaporates and quickly rehydrates and freezes on the engine walls, instead of going into the cylinders
 is kaaran silinderon par paryaapt eendhan maatra na pahunch paane se ingine start hone main samasya aati he
 a dense mixture of air-fuels is then sent to the engine until the engine reaches a sufficient temperature to allow the fuel to evaporate automatically from the jet to the cylinders
 is atirikt eendhan maatra ko dene hetu chok kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This device reduces the flow of air before the venturi at the entrance of the carburetor
 is kaaran carburator bairal main atirikt nirvaat utpann hota he, jo mukhya dhara se atirikt eendhan khinchataa he or aage detaa he
 In this way the engine is able to start even at low temperatures and the choke is stopped when the right temperature is reached
