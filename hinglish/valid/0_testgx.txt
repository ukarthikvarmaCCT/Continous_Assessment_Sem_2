 Till now this girl has been there as a girl

 ab use apane haathon ko nav-nimarn ke anek uttardaayitv sanbhaalane ko taiyaar karnaa he, atev unhen pitvarna mangalik-lakshmi kaa pratik-srujanaatmak hona chahie
 People in the Virgo family, with yellow hands, teach the girl the silence that she has to manifest herself as a creation force and to make these gentle hands more responsive, strong and mangling

51 kanyadan kaa arth he, abhibhavakon ke uttardayitvon kaa var ke upar, sasuraal waalon ke upar sthaanantaran hona
 Till now parents used to manage the girl's maintenance, development, security, happiness, peace, joy, etc
 Now, that will have to be arranged by the groom and his family members
 kanya naye ghar main jaakar viraanepan kaa anubhav na karne paye, use sneh, sahyog, sadbhaav kii kami anubhav na ho, iskaa puraa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 While accepting the Kanyadaan - while accepting the responsibility of Panchayatra, the groom and his parents should feel well that they have to handle that responsibility with full responsibility
 kanyadan kaa arth yah nahin ki jis prakaar koi sampatti, kisi ko bechi yaa daan kar di jaati he, usee prakaar ladki ko bhi ek sampatti samajhakar kisi na kisi ko chaahe jo upyog karne ke liye de diya he
 Every human has an independent power and position
 koi manushya kisi manushya ko bech yaa daan nahin kar saktaa
 Then even if he is a father
 vyakti ke swatantra astitv evam adhikaar se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, na use chunauti di ja sakati he
 Parents, whether girls or boys, do not have the right to sell or donate to them
 aisa karnaa to bachche ke swatantra vyaktitv ke tathy ko hi jhuthalaanaa ho jayega
 Marriage is a bipartisan agreement, which both the bride and the bridegroom succeed with full honesty and integrity
 yadi koi kisi ko kharidi yaa bechi sampatti ke rup main dekhen or us par pashuon jaisaa swaamitv anubhav karen yaa vyavhaar karen, to yah maanavtaa ke moolbhoot adhikaron kaa hanan karnaa hi hoga
 Kanyadaan is not meant to be, its purpose is so much that the guardian of the girl leaves the responsibility of making the girl's life well-organized, well-developed and happy, which she should do carefully
 paraaye ghar main pahunchne par kachi umr kii anubhavheen bhavuk balika ko akharane vaali manodasha main hokar guzarana padataa he
 Therefore, in this initial treaty, especially the groom's side should try to keep the bride getting more affection and support from every point of view
 kanya paksh waalon ko bhi yah nahin soch lenaa chahie ki ladki ke pile haath kar diye, kanyadan ho gaya, ab to unhen kuch bhi karnaa yaa sochna nahin he
 They also have to keep contributing to make the girl's future bright
 kriya or bhaavana- kanya ke haath haldi se pile karke mata-pita apane haath main kanya ke haath, guptadan kaa dhan or pushp rakhkar sankalp bolte hai or un haathon ko var ke haathon main saunp dete hai
 He accepts these hands with seriousness and responsibility by holding his hands
 bhaavana karen ki kanya var ko saunpte hue uske abhibhavak apane samgr adhikaar ko saunpte hai
 The total tribe of Virgo will no longer be from the ancestral tradition, according to the husband tradition
 kanya ko yah bhaavnaatmak purusharth karne tathaa pati ko use sweekaar karne yaa nibhaane kii shakti devshaktiyaan pradaan kar rahi hai
 With this feeling, the resolution of Kanyadaan should be spoken
 sankalp puraa hone par sankalpakatar kanya ke haath var ke haath main saunp den

 It is customary to give some contribution at the time of Kanyadaan
 aate kii loi main chhipaakar kuch dhan kanyadan ke samay diya jaataa he
 This is the form of dowry
 bacchee ke ghar se vidaa hote samay uske abhibhavak kisi aavashyaktaa ke samay kaam aane ke liye uphaar swaroop kuch dhan dete hai, par hota vah gupt hi he
 This is a personal gift between the guardian and the girl
 dusron ko iske sambandh main jaanane yaa poochne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin
 In-laws have no right to say or ask what should be given as dowry
 na uske pradasharn kii aavashyaktaa he, kyon ki garib-amir apni sthiti ke anusaar jo de, vah charchaa kaa vishay nahin bananaa chahie, uske saath ninda-prashansa nahin judani chahie
 If you start following each other, get down to competition, then it will be disastrous
 kanya-paksh par anuchit dabaav padegaa or var-paksh adhik na milane par aprasann hone kii dhristataa karne lagegaa
 Therefore, there is a law for some money with Kanyadaan, but the remotest sages have made a rule keeping in mind the possibility of self-righteousness and wickedness, that whatever dowry is given, it should be completely secret, anyone should discuss it Do not have the right to do
 aate main saadharantaya ek rupaya is dahej pratik ke liye payarpt he
 This metal should be taken and hidden inside the dough circle
 gau pavitrataa or parmarth parayanata kii pratik he
 The girl should give such a donation to the groom, which will inspire them in purity and charity
 sambhav ho, to kanyadan ke avasar par gaay daan main di ja sakati he
 She is also suitable for the health of the girl and her family
 aaj kii sthiti main yadi gau dena yaa lenaa asuvidhajanak ho, to uske liye kuch dhan dekar godaan kii paripati ko jivit rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Action and emotion- Take material in the hand of the bridegroom

 Give the material with mantra in the hands of the groom

 The discipline prescribed by the sages is for the specific goal

 In the direction of religion, meaning and work, sage praneeth mayarda should not be infringed on the right

 This action is like shaking hands
 maanon ek duusare ko pakadakar sahaara de rahe hon
 Like Kanyadaan, it is not an act of grooming, yet on that occasion the spirit of the groom should be exactly the same as it is when handing the girl over
 var bhi yah anubhav karen ki usne apane vyaktitv kaa apni ichha, aakanksha evam gatividhiyon ke sanchaalan kaa kendra is vadhoo ko bana diya or apana haath bhi saunp diya
 When both of them take each other's hand emotionally in front of the society to take each other forward, then it should be understood that the purpose of marriage is fulfilled

15 var-vadhoo dwaara panigrahan ekikaran ke baad samaaj dwaara donon ko ek gaanth main band diya jaataa he
 Tying the ends of a dupatta means the emergence of a new entity from both body and mind as a joint unit
 ab donon ek-duusare ke saath puri tarah bandhe hue hai
 In Granthibandhan, money, flower, Durva, Haridra and Akshat also tie these five things
 paisa isliye rakhaa jaataa he ki dhan par kisi ek kaa adhikaar nahin rahegaa
 Planning and arrangement will be made with the consent of both of them on the earnings or property
 durva kaa arth he- kabhi nijeerv na hone vaali prem bhaavana
 The life element of Durva is not destroyed, even after drying it becomes green when water is poured
 isi prakaar donon ke man main ek-duusare ke liye ajasr prem or atmiyata bani rahe
 Like chandra-chakor, keep on offering yourself to each other
 apana ksht kam or saathi kaa ksht badhkar maane, apane sukh kii apeksha saathi ke sukh kaa adhik dhyaan rakhen
 Keep pouring your inner love on each other
 haridra kaa arth he- aarogy, ek-duusare ke shaareerik, maansik swasthya ko suviksit karne kaa prayatan karen
 Do not behave in such a way that worsens the partner's health or creates mental excitement

 There are so many people in the family

 It is not that they love each other, but they start neglecting the family members
 isi prakaar parivaar se baahar bhi jan maanas ke seva kii jimmedaari har bhaavnashil manushya par rahati he
 It should not happen that either of the two should confine himself to his personal self-help, do not give him the facility of social service
 is disha main lagane vaale samay va dhan kaa virodh kare
 Akshat indicates that both of you are not just made for each other, but the fast and responsibility of social service is also present as an important goal in your people's contribution
 pushp kaa arth he, hanste-khilte rahanaa
 Be ready to spread fame and praise to make each other fragrant
 koi kisi kaa duusare ke aage na to apmaan kare or na tiraskaar
 Thus, by keeping these five, Durva, Pushp, Haridra, Akshat and Paisa, both are formed and it is hoped that the goals with which they are tied together will keep them alive for life
 granthibandhan, achair yaa pratinidhi yaa koi maanya vyakti karen
 By tying the ends of the dupatta together, tie the knot by placing auspicious substance in it

1 praayshchit aahuti ke baad lajahome or yagyagni kii parikrama kaa mila-jula kram chalata he
 For Lajahome, the girl's brother stands behind with a ball in a plate
 ek mutti khil apni bahin ko de
 The girl hands him over to the groom
 var use aahuti mantra ke saath havan kar de
 Thus, it should be done three times
 kanya teenon baar bhai ke dwaara diye hue khil ko apane pati ko de, vah teenon baar havan main aparn kar de
 In Lajahome, the sister gets a meal from her brother's house, which she hands over to her husband
 kahati he beshak mere vyaktigat upyog ke liye pita ke ghar se mujhe kuch mila he, par use main chhipaakar alag se nahin rakhti, aapako saunpti hoon
 No one should feel alienation or the feeling of concealment, so just as the husband earns something, the wife gives it to the wife, similarly the wife also hands over her achievements to the husband
 pati sochataa he, ham log haath-pair se jo kamaayenge, usee se apana kaam chalaayenge, kisi ke udaartaapurvak diye hue anudaan ko bina shram kiye khaakar kyon ham kisi ke rini bane
 Therefore the husband does not keep that laja for his dinner, but gives home in the yagya
 jan kalyaan ke liye us padaarth ko vayubhoot banaakar sansar ke vayumandal main bikher detaa he
 In this action, the great human ideal is embodied here that if the goods of free will not be accepted or received, then it should be spent in the public interest
 log apni-apni nij kii paseene kii kamai par hi guzar-basar karen
 The same idealism was behind the feast of the deceased that the boys did not take the money received by the father in succession in his work, but spent it in the subsistence of the social Brahmins or in other virtues
 yahi dahej ke sambandh main bhi thik he
 The father's home was generous, so his sentiment is commendable, but you too must have some feelings
 muft kaa maal khate hue kisi kamau manushya kaa gairat aana swaabhaavik he
 It is right for him to think that the money without hard work, given by the generous spirit of charity, will not digest it, so it is only appropriate to sacrifice the gift in the work of Jan Mangal, the charitable sacrifice
 isi uddeshy se patni ke bhai ke dwaara diye gayi laja ko vah yajna kaary main laga detaa he
 This is the right use of dowry, it is also a practice that a lot of charity is done on behalf of the bride's side on the occasion of marriage
 acha ho jo kuch mili, vah sabko hi daan kar de
 Not only at the time of marriage, but also on other occasions, if anyone ever gets the gift of such hard work from someone, then there should be a policy regarding that we will not become indebted to the hereafter by eating free goods, but by applying such grant in charity
 By not stopping that liberal tradition in itself, we will further increase it for public welfare
 kahan bhartiya samskruti kii udaar bhaavana or kahan aaj ke dhan lolupon dwaara kanya paksh kii aanten noch daalane vaali dahej kii pashachik maangen, donon main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar he
 Those who gave their heart, soul piece to the girl, should be thankful to the groom's side and think about how to express their reverence and goodwill in return for this supernatural gift
 yah na hokar ulte jab kanya paksh ko dabaa hua samaj kar use tarah-tarah se sataane or chusane kii yojana banaai jaati he, to yahi samajhnaa chahie ki bhartiya paramparaayen bilkul ulti ho gayin
 Unrighteousness in place of religion, kingdom of insecurity came in place of divinity
 lajahome vatarmaan kaal kii kshudra manyataon ko dhikkaarta he or dahej ke sambandh main sahi drushtikon apnaane kii prerana detaa he
 Orbiting the husband and wife of fire
 baayen se daayen kii ore chalem
 In the first four revolutions, the girl was ahead and the groom was behind
 chaar parikrama ho jane par ladkaa aage ho jaae or ladki peeche
 At the time of the parikrama, the parikrama mantra should be spoken and after completion of each parikrama, every bride and groom should go to the Gayatri Mantra, this means - the girl will be the leader in the household work, her counseling will be given importance, and her importance will be given
 Will follow, because the woman has more experience of those works
 baahar ke kaaryon main var netritv karata he or nari uskaa anusaran karti he, kyonki vyavsaayik kshetron main var kaa anubhav adhik hota he
 In which the information of the direction is less, be careful to increase its information in another and make it equivalent
 bhaavana kshetra main nari aage hai, karm kshetra main purush
 Both sides are important in their respective positions
 kul milakar nari kaa vacharsv, pad, gaurav evam vajan bada baithta he
 Therefore he is given the opportunity to do four revolutions and the male to do three revolutions
 gaurav ke chunaav ke 4 vot kanya ko or 3 vot var ko milte hai
 Therefore, female has always got first place from male
 seetaram, radheshyaam, lakshminarayan, umamahesh aadi yugmon main pehle nari kaa naam he, peeche nar kaa
 The mixed order of Laja Home and Parikrama goes on
 shilarohan ke baad var-vadhoo khadey-khadey gayatri mantra se ek aahuti samarpit karen
 Now revolve with the mantra
 vadhoo aage, var peeche chalem
 Upon completion of a circumambulation, make a sacrifice of Lajahom
 aahuti karke duusari parikrama pehle kii tarah mantra bolte hue karen
 In the same way, do Lajahom's second sacrifice and do the third revolution and the third sacrifice make the fourth revolution
 iske baad gayatri mantra kii aahuti dete hue teen parikramaayen var ko aage karke parikrama mantra bolte hue karai jaaen
 Feel with ahuti that outside the yajna energy and in the conscience, the yajna spirit is getting stronger
 parikrama ke saath bhaavana karen ki yagyeey anushaasan ko kendra maanakar, yagyagni ko sakshi karke adarsh daampaty ke niwarh kaa sankalp kar rahe hai

3 After taking direction and inspiration again, Saptapadi is done
 saat baar var-vadhoo saath-saath kadam se kadam milakar faujee sainikon kii tarah aage badhate hai
 The seven rice piles or kalwaas are tied with tied ends, with these goal-marks set, the two move one step forward, stopping and then taking the next step
 is prakaar saat kadam badhaaye jate hai
 Each mantra is spoken with each step
 pehla kadam ann ke liye, doosraa bal ke liye, teesraa dhan ke liye, chauthaa sukh ke liye, paanchavaan parivaar ke liye, chhathvaan ritucharya ke liye or saatvaan mitrataa ke liye uthaaya jaataa he
 After marriage, husband and wife have to adopt seven programs together
 unamem donon kaa uchit or nyaay sangat yogadan rahe, isaki ruparekha saptapadi main nidharrit kii gayi he
 The first step is to increase food
 aahaar swasthyavardhak ho, ghar main chatorapen ko koi sthaan na mili
 What is prepared in the kitchen should be such that it serves the purpose of health care, even if it is not tasty
 ann kaa utpaadan, ann kii raksha, ann kaa sadupyog jo kar saktaa he, vahi safal grihasth he
 Taking too much food, leaving the milk, keeping the pot open, wasting food in the rats, making the body rich in sugar and spices, not taking care of hygiene, etc
 Even after spending a lot on diet, health is destroyed, so the couple The responsibility of life is to take proper care of the sattvikta of food
 doosraa kadam shaareerik or maansik bal kii vruddhi ke liye he
 Exercise, hard work, proper and regular dietary strength keeps the body stable
 adhyayan evam vichaar-vimarsh se manobal badhata he
 Efforts should be made to increase both types of force, both to be more capable, healthy and strong - the solution should be kept in mind
 teesraa kadam dhan kii vruddhi ke liye he
 Economy budget should be made and run
 apvyay main kani kaudi bhi nasht na hone paae
 Do not skimp on the appropriate tasks - do not spend money for fashion, addiction, boasting, etc
, and keep it safe for family advancement
 uparjan ke liye pati-patni donon hi prayatan karen
 Men go out to do agriculture, business, jobs etc
, then women earn this kind by sewing, washing, cleaning etc
 uparjan par jitna dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he, kharch kii maryaadaaon kaa bhi vaisaa hi dhyaan rakhte hue ghar kii arthvyavastha sanbhaale rahanaa daampaty jivan kaa anivaary kattarvy he
 The fourth step is to increase happiness
 vishram, manoranjan, vinod, haas-parihaas kaa aisa vaataavaran rakhaa jaae ki garibi main bhi amiri kaa anand mili
 Both be happy
 muskaraane kii aadat daalen, hanste-hansaate jindagi kaaten
 Keep the mind light, adopt the policy of 'santoshi always happy'
 paanchavaan kadam parivaar paalan kaa he
 All should be treated properly, small and big
 ashrith pashuon evam naukaron ko bhi parivaar mana jaae, is sabhi ashriton kii samuchit dekhbhaal, suraksha, unnati evam sukh-shaanti ke liye sadaa sochane or karne main laaparvaahee na barti jaae
 The sixth step is of Ritucharya
 santanotpaadan ek swaabhaavik vritti he, isliye daampaty jivan main uskaa bhi ek sthaan he, par us sambandh main mayaardaaon kaa puri kathorta evam satarkta se paalan kiya jaae, kyonki asanyam ke kaaran donon ke swasthya kaa sarvanaash hone kii ashanka rahati he, grihasth main rahakar bhi brahmacharya kaa samuchit paalan kiya jaae
 Both of them should also look at each other from the point of view of a friend, as far as possible the omniscient themes of sexuality should be kept away
 santaan utpann karne se purv hajaar baar vichaar karen ki apni sthiti santaan ko susanskrit banane yogya he yaa nahin
 Carry the responsibility of producing children in that dignity
 saatvaan kadam mitrataa ko sthir rakhane evam badhaane ke liye he
 Both of them keep thinking closely that there is no error from their side, due to which the partner has an opportunity to become angry or dissatisfied
 doosraa paksh kuch bhul bhi kar rahaa ho, to uskaa uttar kathorta, karkashta se nahin, varan sajjanta, sahrudayata ke saath diya janaa chahie, taaki us mahanata se dabakar saathi ko swatah hi sudharne kii antahprerana mili
 With outsiders, the policy of wickedness can be adopted to some extent with the wicked, but in order to win the hearts of the souls, weapons such as generosity, service, courtesy, forgiveness should be used
 saptapadi main saat kadam badhaate hue in saat sutron ko hridyangam karnaa padataa he
 If these ideals and principles are adopted by husband and wife and determined to move forward step by step to follow the same path, then there is no doubt in the success of married life
 kriya or bhaavnavar-vadhoo khadey hon
 Before taking each step, the mantra of witnessing of the Dev Shaktis is uttered, at that time meditate with the bride and groom hand

 arthath prati-oxykaarak ve anu hai, jo anya anuon ko oxikaran se bachaate hai yaa anya anuon kii oxikaran prakriya ko dhimaa kar dete hai

 In the automatic oxidation process, the actuators of the chain are free radicals which are very active
 swat: oxikrut honevaale anu main jo sabase nirbal carbon-hydrogen bandha hota he usee ke tuutane se ye mulak banate hai
 Therefore, the presence of a hydrogen atom easily emitted in this type of material is necessary

 Although oxidation reactions are very important for life, they can also be harmful
 oxikaran abhikriya se muktamulak utpann ho sakate hai, jinke dwaara koshikaon ko kshati pahunchane vaali shrunkhlaa abhikriya aarambh ho jaati he
 Antioxidants themselves are oxidized to these free radicals, which helps to break the chain reaction
 kar koshikaon par hone vaali in shrunkhlaa abhikriyaaon ko roak dete hai
 Therefore, there are often antioxidant reducing agents, such as thiol, ascorbic acid or polyphenols, etc

 For Japanese bands see penicillin
 penicillin yaa pen bhi kaha jaataa he) antibiotic kaa ek samooh he, jisaki vyutpatti penicillium fungi se hui he
 Penicillin antibiotics are historically important, as they are the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases such as syphilis and Staphylococcus infection
 penicillin aaj bhi vyapak rup se prayog main laai ja rahi hai, haalanki kai prakaar ke jeevanu ab pratirodhi ban chuke hai
 All penicillins are beta-lactam antibiotics and are used in the treatment of bacterial infections that are usually gram-positive, due to organism-like hypersensitivity
 "penicillin" shabd un padaarthon ke mishran ko bhi kah sakate hai jo swaabhaavik evam jaivik paddati se utpaadit kiye jate hai
 The term "penam" is used to define the main structure of a member of a penicillin antibiotic

 The credit for the discovery of penicillin goes to Scottish scientist and Nobel laureate Alexander Fleming in 1928
 unhone dikhaaya ki yadi penicillium notatom upyukt sabstrate main bade, to yah antibiotic gunon ke saath ek padaarth nicksruth karegaa, jise unhone penicillin qaraar diya
 This casual observation heralded a modern era of antibiotic discovery

 It was an accidental accident: In his lab in the basement of St Mary's Hospital in London, Fleming noticed that he had accidentally left a vessel with bacteria, including Staphylococcus plate culture, contaminated with a blue-green mold
 , Whose development was visible

 Fleming concluded that the cam was extracting a substance that was inhibiting this growth and killing bacteria
 unhone ek shuddh culture viksit kiya evam paaya ki yah ek penicillium sancha tha, jise ab penicillium notatom ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The us Charles Thom, working as an American expert in the Department of Agriculture, was an acknowledged expert and Fleming referred the matter to him
 Fleming coined the term "penicillin" to describe the decantation of broth culture of penicillium molds
 Even in these early stages, penicillin was found to be quite effective in fighting gram-positive bacteria and ineffective in fighting gram-negative components and fungi
 unhone praarambhik aashaa jataai ki penicillin ek upyogi keetanunashak hoga, jo aaj uplabdh roganurodhakon ke mukaable nunatam vishaaktata ke saath behad shaktishaalee hoga evam "basilas influenza " ke prayogshaala sambandhi mahatv kaa bhi ullekh kiya
 After further experiments, Fleming was convinced that penicillin could not last long in the human body to kill pathogenic bacteria, and he stopped studying it after 1931

 Nonetheless, the beta-lactam ring was such that related antibiotics, including mesilineams, carbapenems, and most importantly cephalosporins, still remain at the center of its structure
 β-lactem antibiotic jeevanugat koshika diwaar main paptidoglican cross-link ke gathan ko rokte hue kaam karata he
 The β-lactam moiety of penicillin binds to the enzyme (transpeptidase), which binds to the peptidoglycan molecules of bacteria, weakening the cell wall of the bacterium, further enhancing the activation of peptidoglycan precursor hydrolysis and autolysins of the bacterial cell wall
 , Which subsequently digests the existing peptidoglycan of bacteria

 From the Household Cyclopedia of 1881 yah prakriya vasant ritu yaa garmiyon main sabase achche dhang se ho paati he, jab jameen sukhi hoti he
 The main drain should be made in each part of the area where a cross cut or open drain was formerly required; Their average depth should be four feet
 isse ye ghodon yaa maweshiyon dwaara ronde jane se hone vaali kshati se puri tarah se surakshit ho jaati hai or choti naaliyon se itani duuri par hone se unke liye baariki se pani saafe karti hai
 In every case, if possible, pipe turf is more preferable to the main drains
 agar acchhee kathor mitti ho to pipe turf kii ek pankti, yadi retili ho to pipe turf kii dohari pankti dena chahie
 If pipe turf is not easily found, a good wedge drain is a better option if the subsoil is strong, hard soil; But the subsoil is only marginally such that the Thorn drain, which has joints below it, will still prove to be better; And if the subsoil is very sandy, then it is useless to try to make drains below the surface in the field by any method other than pa ips
 yahaan is baat kaa kaa ullekh karnaa aavashyak he ki lambaai or bahaav kii dhaal tathaa isamen pravaahit hone vaale pani kii maatra ke anusaar mukhya naalee kaa aakaar nirdhaarit kiya janaa chahie
 Although it is always safe to have large drains and large numbers, this is rarely done due to cost
 mukhya naaliyaan banane ke pashchaat, yadi purv main tile 15 feet se kam chaude na hon to khet kii prayek kyari main choti naaliyaan banaaen

 If the field has already been leveled then under no circumstances should they become hollow
 haalanki, is udhaaharan main, kyonki naalee ke sheersh ke pani main doobane ke kaaran mukhyatah sataha kaa pani chadhataa he, naaliyon ko ek duusare ke or paas - jaise ki pandraa se bees feet tak banane kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 If the mounds are more than fifteen feet wide, no matter how wide or irregular, always follow the lines of the old beds as the best direction of the drain; And where a large number of mounds are assembled, a depth of twenty to twenty-four inches will be sufficient for pipe drains and twenty-four to thirty inches for wedge drains
 choti tathaa mukhya naaliyon ko aapas main jodne ke dauraan vishesh saavdhaanee barti jaani chahie, jisase pani ko mukhya naaliyon se ek badhamukt tathaa acchhee dhaal mil sake
 When the drains are finished, the dunes are broken by the plow and a second attempt may be made, where formerly they were extremely high, but it would be better not to over-level the dunes so that they Being able to live a little in its old state, where the drains are at the lowest level of the ground, the surface water collects up to the top of the drains and drowns in them freely
 Sector flows
 khet main aisa karne ke baad, choti naaliyon ke aar paar nae tile banaaen, unhen das feet chaudaa rakhen or uske baad khet main usee tarah se hal chalaaen jaise shushk bhoomi par chalaaya jaataa he
 It is clear from the above method of drainage that the expenditure will vary according to the number of main drains in the field, the distance between small drains and the distance to be fixed on the field

 But if it is not completely exhausted, put as many branches in the main drain as necessary to stop the water in the middle and thus hardly feel frustrated

 Quickly filling the pits along with digging is very important because, if left open for a long time, not only will the surrounding soil fall into it but also its edges can become damaged or irregular, which will later be completely cured
 Can not be done
 Straw or soil containing soil should be applied over the material to avoid surface soil erosion and more attention needs to be paid to where wood is used for filler, otherwise the proposed improvements can be easily frustrating 
 yadi dhyaan se nishpadit kii jaae to jal nikasi kii pit vidhi bahut prabhavi he
