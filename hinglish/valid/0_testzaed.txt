 angrejon ke saath-saath anya aupniveshik shaktiyon ko apekshaakrit ek maamuli upasthiti tak simit kar diya gaya tha
 In 1818 Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of the British Colony at Bencullen
 They were committed that Great Britain should replace the Netherlands as a dominating power in the archipelago, as that trade route between China and British India passed through the archipelago, which began opium trade with China
 It was very important from the point of view
 dach log dach-niyantrit bandargahon main angrejon kii gatividhiyon par roak lagaakar yaa unhen baari tarriff dene ke liye majaboor kar is kshetra main british vyapaar kaa galaa ghont rahe the

 With the help of Tamengong, Raffles managed to bring Hussein back to Singapore via smuggling
 He proposed to recognize Hussein as the real sultan of Johor and arrange an annual payment for him; In return, Husain gave the British the right to establish a commercial port in Singapore
 a formal treaty was signed on 6 February 1819 and thus modern Singapore was born

 The Farquhar administration was properly funded and barred from collecting port fees to raise revenue as Raffles decided that Singapore would be a free port
 Despite these difficulties, the new colony developed rapidly
 As news of the free port spread throughout the archipelago, the Bugis, Peranakan Chinese and Arab merchants turned to the island seeking to circumvent the trade restrictions of the Dutch people

 Surprised at the disarray of the colony, Raffles decided to draft a set of new policies for the settlement
 unhone raddles plan of singapore ke tahat singapore ko kaaryaatmak or jaateey sabdivijanon main sangathit kiya
 The remains of this organization can still be found in the ethnic neighboring areas
 7 june 1823 ko raddles ne sultan or temengong ke saath ek duusari sandhi par hastakshar kiya jisane is dweep ke zyaadaatar hisson main angreji adhipaty kaa vistaar kar diya

 This settlement made the island subject to British law, which provided that it would take into account Malay customs, traditions and religion
 Raffles replaced Farquhar as the new governor, John Crawford, who was a skilled and frugal administrator

 During the following decades, Singapore became an important port in the region

 Kumbh festival is an important festival of Hinduism, in which crores of devotees take bath in Kumbh festival at Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nashik
 inamen se prayek sthaan par prati barahawein varsh or prayag main do kumbh parvon ke bich chah varsh ke antaraal main ardhakumbh bhi hota he
 The 2013 Kumbh took place in Prayag
 2019 main prayag main ardhakumbh meley kaa aayojan hoga
 According to astronomical calculations, this fair starts on the day of Makar Sankranti, when the Sun and Moon enter Scorpio, and Jupiter, Aries
 makar sankranti ke hone vaale is yoga ko "kumbh snaan-yoga" kehete hai or is din ko vishesh mangalik mana jaataa he, kyonki aisa mana jaataa he ki is din prithvi se ucch lokon ke dwaar is din khulte hai or is prakaar is din snaan karne se aatma ko ucch lokon kii prapti sahajata se ho jaati he
 Bathing here is considered to be a heavenly vision

 The last Kumbh in Haridwar took place in 1998
 haridwar main 26 janvari se 14 may 2004 tak chalaa tha ardh kumbh mela, uttaranchal rajya ke gathan ke pashchaat aisa pratham avasar tha
 During this, 14 April 2004 was considered the most auspicious day for the holy bath
 puranic vishwaas jo kuch bhi ho, jyotishiyon ke anusaar kumbh kaa asaadhaaran mahatv brihaspati ke kumbh raashi main pravesh tathaa surya ke mesh raashi main pravesh ke saath judaa he
 The position of the planets medicates the Ganges water at Har ki Pauri place on the banks of the Ganges flowing from Haridwar and it becomes nectaric in those days
 yahi kaaran he ki apni antaratma kii shuddhi hetu pavitra snaan karne lakhon shraddhalu yahan aate hai
 From the spiritual point of view, the position of planets during the period of Ardh Kumbh is excellent for concentration and meditation
 haalaanki sabhi hindu tyohaar samaan shraddha or bhakthi ke saath manaae jate he, par yahan ardh kumbh tathaa kumbh meley ke liye aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya sabase adhik hoti he
 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell

 Improved heat conduction helps in the emission of heat through brakes which increases brake performance in more stressful driving conditions and reduces the possibility of brake failure due to excessive heat
 mishra dhaatu pahiye apni acchhee banaavat ke kaaran bhi kharide jate hai haalanki iname jin mishra dhaatuon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he vah jangrodhak nahin hoti hai
 Attractive metallic finishing wheels can be made using alloys, but their use requires the wheels to be completely covered by paint or wheel covers

 If proper protective measures are not taken, the alloy wheels are more prone to galvanic decay, which can result in air leakage from the wheels
 saath hi mudane par, mishra dhaatu ke pahiyon kii marammat bhi steel ke pahiyon kii tulana main adhik kathin hoti he, lekin inke oonche daamon ke kaaran inhen badalane ke sthaan par marammat karwaanaa hi adhik uchit hota he or yahaan tak ki buree tarah se kshatigrast pahiye bhi ek 10 bindu prakriya dwaara bilkul nae jaise marammat kiye ja sakate hai, haalanki yah is par nirbhar karata he ki in pahiyon kaa swami kis seemaa tak inaki vaastavik upyogita yaa uplabdhta ko bachaana chahta he
 Alloy wheels are more expensive to produce than ordinary steel wheels, and therefore are often not included as standard equipment, instead they are marketed as optional supplements or a more expensive trim package
 
 haalanki ek dashak pehle ke samay se tulana kiye jane par, jabaki saste vaahanon par factory se hi mishra dhaatu ke pahiye milanaa lagbhag asambhav tha, us samay ko dekhte hue 2000, se mishra dhaatu ke pahiye kaaphi prachlit ho gaye hai, jo ab sasti or sab compact kaaron ke saath bhi die jate hai
 Alloy wheels have long been offered as standard equipment with high-end luxury and sports cars, with the option of oversized or "exclusive" alloy wheels
 mishra dhaatu pahiyon ke oonche daam choron ko aakarshith karte hai; isse nibatane ke liye, vaahan banane vaale or bechney vaale praayah loking wheel nuts kaa prayog karte hai jinhen kholane ke liye ek khaas chaabi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most alloy wheels are produced by casting but some are made by pressure process
 dabaav prakriya se bane pahiye aam taur par halke, majboot hote hai lekin dhalaai dwaara bane pahiyon kii tulana main adhik mahange hote hai
 a much larger collection of alloy wheels is available for vehicle owners who want lighter, more visually appealing, rarer and / or larger wheels for their car
 kai log aisa maanate hai ki bade pahiyon ke istemaal se vaahan kaa pradarshan, chaalan or suspension kii kaaryakshmata swatah hi bad jaataa he, phir bhi car or chaalak par ek pareekshan kiya gaya jisame 15" se lekar 19" aakaar vaale vibhinn pahiyon kaa istemaal kiya gaya ye sabhi ek hi prakaar ke va model ke tair the or saamaan rup se susajjit the, is pareekshan ke parinaam swarup yah dekhne main aayaa ki donon hi prakaar ke bade pahiyon dwaara eendhan kifaayat main 0-60 guna tak kii kami ai

 Most wheels are made by casting, while some of the names above are made by pressure processes such as Vellano and Weld
 Many such companies have formed over the years due to the keen demand for fast cars and the increasing demand for larger diameter wheels

 Due to the cheap chrome wheels being shipped from China, the market availability of casting wheels is more than required
 sinerjis casting limited or anya companiyon ke madhyam se pichley kuch samay main bharat bhi mishra dhaatu / krom pahiyon kaa ek bada aapurtikarta ban gaya he

 Magnesium wheels are flammable and have been prohibited in some forms of motorsport in the UK after some fires that made it very difficult to extinguish

 Despite pressure from other plaintiffs, she denies the accountability of the church fire report but confesses to the charge, rather than meeting the demand for a handwriting sample
 maaikel ko tab haina ke us rahasy kaa pataa chal jaataa he: vah nirakshar he or usne is baat ko jivan bhar chipa kar rakhaa he
 Other female guards who claim that she wrote this report are lying to blame Hanna for her responsibility

 Michael then does not write or meet her but continues to send tapes and in 1988 a prison officer telephones him and asks for help with Hanna's rehabilitation in his society after Hanna's upcoming release
 vah uske rahane or uske liye ek naukari kaa bandobast kar detaa he or antat usase mulaakaat karata he
 When they meet after 30 years, he stays away from it to some extent and confronts what he has learned from his past

 You can also argue that the film is not really about the Holocaust but about the generation that grew up in its shadow which is also emphasized in the book
 lekin film na to hollocost ke bare main he or na hi un germanon ke bare main he jo isaki viraasat se jude hai: yah darshakon ko ek aisi aitihaasik traasadee ke bare main acha mahasoos karaane ke bare main he jo har nae ruchikar prakshep ke saath mand hone lagata he
 Writing in The Los Angeles Times, Patrick Goldstein stated that "the biggest problem of the picture is that it does not clearly capture the chilling intensity of its source material" and said that most film critics have an "extended fade" towards the film
 The initial response was "

 However, what Hanna has done is apparently not shown in the film
 " Kirk Honeycutt was more lenient in The Hollywood Reporter, according to which the closing of the picture was a "well-known future story" as well as a "turbulent one" to raise critical questions about complicity in the Holocaust

 In The Huffington Post, Thelma Adams described the relationship between Hanna and Michael as an inaccurate relationship that was more turbulent than any historical question in the movie: maaikel shoshan kaa shikaar he or uskaa shoshak maatr ek maadak sevanivrutt aushavitz guard he
 You can call their undercover and its consequences a symptom of both generations of Germans passing crime from one generation to another, but that does not explain why the filmmakers luxuryly portrayed Doldry and the hair in the sex scenes - - And what made it so interesting is that viewers could not see it because it is child pornography

93 percent and carbon dioxide 0
03 percent
 in gaison ke atirikt kuch anya gaisen bhi hoti hai, jaise hydrogen tathaa ozone
 The mixing of dry air by continuous mixing of the lower atmosphere by winds and by vertical convection is so irreversible that the atomic mass of dry air remains constant at 28

 Therefore, the percentage volume of water vapor in the atmosphere keeps increasing greatly
 vayumandal main jalawaashp kaa ghatana badhanaa rituvigyaan ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 Evaporation and condensation of water is important not only because they transport water from one place to another, but also because evaporation of water requires absorption of latent heat

 The air pressure of any place is generated by the weight of the air above it, so the difference between the pressures of two different heights is equal to the weight of the unit's transverse section of air between these two heights
 yadi yah daab kaa antar bich kii hawa ke bhaar se yatharth rup main santulit na ho to us vayustar ko upar kii ore yaa neeche kii ore twaran praapt hota he
 The situation in which the pressure difference and air load are balanced, or that there is no vertical acceleration other than gravitational acceleration, is called a situation of hydrostatic equilibrium
 yah paristhiti kisi bhi str par oonchaai ke saath dabaparivartan kii dar kaa parichay detii he
 If there is a pressure difference between two pressures and there is a vertical distance between two levels, density and accelerated gravity, then is sameekaran ko dravasthaitik sameekaran kehete hai
 Gravitational acceleration decreases only slightly due to different latitudes and altitudes, but due to pressure, heat, and moisture, the density of air decreases in greater quantity

 The reason for evaporation and condensation in the atmosphere is the decrease in the ability of the air to absorb water vapor, that is, hot or cold air
 saadhaarant: vayumandal main jalawaashp-maatra santrupt maatra se kam hoti he, visheshkar bhootal ke sameep jahaan vayumandal kaa prabhavakaari aatapan adhiktam hota he
 Much of the moisture in the air, which keeps the water cycle running in the atmosphere, is obtained by evaporation
 jaise-jaise jal vashpit hota he, taise taise vah vayumandal main visarit hota rahata he
 The seasonal actions by evaporation in the atmosphere are not relatively significant
 drishy bhaap kii uttapati bhi vaashpan dwaara honevaali mausami kriya he
 Very cold or relatively cold humid air becomes highly saturated due to the rapid evaporation of hot water from the surface
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki drishy bhaap ke rup main nami kaa turant sanghanan ho jaataa he jiske kaaran sthir hawa main ghanaa koharaa ban jaataa he
 Condensation occurs on an open surface when the temperature of that surface is lower than the temperature of the surrounding air's dew point
 is prakaar ke sanghanan ke udhaaharan garam mausam main paae jate hai
 For example, even though the relative humidity of air is sufficiently below 100 percent, the vapor of the air condenses outside a glass filled with ice water
 Similarly, on a clean Pacific night, the condensation of dew occurs on those ground objects Radiation cools to lower temperatures due to the dew of the surrounding air, frost settles on surfaces that are colder than freezing, regardless of free Why should the temperature of the air be much higher than the freezing point? jab vayumandal ke bheetar chote chhot jalbinduon ke rup main sanghanan hota he to prashn yah uthta he ki yah prakram kis prakaar prarambh hota he
 Experimentation has proved that condensation does not occur as a burning point in completely insoluble air, even if the vapor pressure in it is ten times the saturation pressure

 In places where the smoke of factories contaminates the atmosphere, small particles of oxides of substances such as smoke sulfur, phosphorus, etc
 become condensation nuclei

 An example of a polymer capable of blending is a PLA film of less than 20 micrometers thickness - films that are thicker than this are not considered blending, even if they are capable of biodegradation
 a household blending process logo is also going to be available soon, which will make it possible for consumers to put packaging items directly in their own blending heap
 polimaron or biopolimaron ke bich mukhya bhinnata unki sanrachanaon main hoti he
 Polymers, including biopolymers, are composed of units called monomers
 biopolimaron kii sanrachana aksar acchhee tarah se spasht hoti he, haalanki yah unka vishisht lakshan nahin hota : proteinon main, in ikaiyon kii sahi rasaynic sanrachana or vyavasthaatmak shrankhla ko praathmik sanrachana kaha jaataa he
 Many biopolymers automatically double into specific sizes, determining their biological function and which in a complex way depend on their primary compositions
 biopolimaron ke rachanaatmak gunon ke adhyayan ko rachanaatmak jeevigyaan kehete hai
 In contrast, most synthesized polymers are designed to be much simpler and more random
 is tathy ke dwaara ek anvik pind vitaran ko pahunchaa jaataa he, jo biopolimaron main nahin paaya jaataa
darasal main, chunki adhikansh jivan-dashaon main unka sanshleshan ek template nirdeshit prakriya se niyantrit hota he, isaliye ek prakaar ke sabhi biopolimur dikhne main ek samaan hote hai – un sabhi main monomeron kii ek samaan shrankhlaayein or sankhyaayein hoti hai or sabhi samaan bhaar vaale hote hai
 This process is called monodispersity, whereas synthesized polymers have polydispersity
 falswaroop, biopolimaron kaa polidispercity suchakank 1 hota he
 Biopolymers are usually produced from bioparticles, which are derived from crops such as sugar beet, potato or wheat
 jab unka prayog biopolimaron ke utpaadan ke liye kiya jaataa he to unhen abhojya fasalon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, jinhen nimna pathmargon main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he: Sugar Beet - Glyconic Acid - Polyglonic Acid starch – – lactic acid – polilactic acid Biopinds - Bioethanol - Ethane - Polyethylene biopolimur akshay, tikaoo hote hai or carbon ke prati tatasth ho sakate hai Biopolymers are renewable because they are made from vegetative materials that can be grown continuously every year
 yah vanaspati padaarth krushik gaiyr khaadya fasal se utpann hote hai
 Therefore the use of biopolymers can create a sustainable industry
 iske vipareet, polimaron ke liye aavashyak petrorsyanon se praapt vasteen antat samaapt ho jaaengin
 iske alaava, biopolimur carbon-utsarjan ko kam kar sakate hai or vaataavaran main CO2 kii maatra main kami laa sakate hai
 This is possible because the CO2 emitted at the time of their degradation is absorbed by crops grown in their place, making them neutral to carbon
 biopolimur jainasvakramakaraniya hai or kuch ko kampost bhi kiya ja saktaa he Some biopolymers are biodegradable - they are dissected into CO2 and water by microorganisms
 iske alaava, inamen se kuch jaev avakramakaraniya biopolimaron kaa kampostikaran kiya ja saktaa he – unhen audyogic sammishran kii prakriya main daalaa ja saktaa he jisase unka 90% tak bhaag 6 maheenon ke bheetar vichchhedit ho jaataa he
 Biopolymers that are capable of this can be marked under the European standard EN 13432 with a blending mark

 The most attention-grabbing polysaccharides for industrial use in commodities today are cellulose and starch
 lekin bacteria or fafundi se utpann adhik jatil carbohydrate polimaron kii ore ab or adhik dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Examples include xanthan, curdlan, pullulan, and hyaluronic acid
 ye polimur saadharantah ekaadhik prakaar ke carbohydrate monomaron se yukt hote hai or kai maamalon main to in polimaron main niyamit shakhayukta rachanaaen hoti hai
 For example, starch is a physical combination of branched and linear polymers, but it contains only one type of carbohydrate - glucose
 Both cellulose and starch are composed of hundreds or thousands of glucopiranoside units
 ye ikaiyaan ek ikai main chakrik glucose ke carbon parmaanu or bagal vaali ikai main hydraxil samooh ke bich acetal baandon dwaara judi hoti hai
 Starch is a polymer widely found in flora
 iske utpaadan ke liye prayukt mukhya fasalon main aalu, makka or chaaval shaamil hai
 In all these plants starch is produced in the form of particles, which may vary in size and structure in every plant
 mote taur par kan kaa kareeb 20 bhaar% amylos naamak rekhaakaar polimur hota he or shesh bhaag shakhit polimur amylopectin hota he
 Amylose is crystalline and can have an average molecular weight of up to 500,000, but is soluble in boiling water
 amylopectin ubalte pani main aghulansheel hota he, lekin khadyapadaarthon main prayog ke samay donon ansh anzimon dwaara acetal jod par aasaani se jal-vichchhedit kar diye jate hai
 Starch is used extensively as a raw material in film production due to the increasing sentiment and low achievement of traditional film-making resins
 starch filmon main pargamyata kam hoti he or isaliye khaadya kii packaging ke liye ye vasteen aakarshak hai
 Starch is also useful in the production of agricultural mulch films, as it is degraded into harmless products when exposed to soil microorganisms
 starch par kiye jane vaale shodh main uske jal-avasorana, rasaynic sanshodhan or ushn-yantrikeey prabhaav kii jaanch shaamil he
 Although starch is a polymer, its stability is not high under pressure conditions
 At temperatures above 150 ° c the glucoside joints begin to disintegrate and the starch particle above 250 ° c collapses inter-thermally
 kam taapamanon par, paschgaman naamak ek prakriya dekhi jaati he
 It consists of agglomeration of molecular chains during the reorganization and cooling of hydrogen bonds
 10 °C
 jaisi charam sthiti main, avakshepan ho jaataa he
 In this way, although the starch can be dispersed in hot water and molded into film, the above process creates a plastic-like brittle condition and can eventually disintegrate the film
