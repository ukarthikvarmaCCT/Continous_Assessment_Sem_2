 Most academic and scientific sources state that the relationships shown between the events of the world and the words of Nostradamus are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations or are so weak as to present them as evidence of the power to tell the real future It is useless
 kuch galat vyakhyaayein yaa galat anuwaad to jaanboojhkar bhi kiye gaye hai
 In spite of this too, in the twentieth century the alleged prophecies of Nostradamus became very popular among the common people and they were credited with the prediction of several major world events
 bhavishya kii baton ko hajaaron saal pehle ghoshnaa karne ke liye mashhoor nastredamas kaa janm 14 disambar 1503 ko france ke ek chote se gaanv saint remi main hua
 His name was Michel de Nostredamus, since childhood, he was particularly interested in studies and acquired special expertise in esoteric subjects like mathematics, physiology and astrology besides Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages
 nastredamas ne kishoravastha se hi bhavishyavaaniyan karnaa shuru kar di thi
 His growing interest in astrology made parents worried because fundamentalist Christians did not see this discipline well at that time
 jyotish se unka dhyaan hataane ke liye unhe chikitsa vigyaan padhne maant pelior bhej diya gaya jiske baad teen varsh kii padhai puri kar nastredamas chikitsak ban gaye
 On 23 October 1529, he received his doctorate from Mont Polier itself and became a teacher in the same university
 pehali patni ke dehanth ke baad 1547 main europe jaakar unhone ain se duusari shaadi kar lee
 During this time he earned a special name as a prophet
 ek kinvadanti ke anusaar ek baar nastredamas apane mitra ke saath italy kii sadakon par tahal rahe the, unhonen bheed main ek yuvak ko dekha or jab vah yuvak paas aayaa to use aadar se sir jhukaakar namaskara kiya
 The friend asked the reason for this, to his surprise, he said that this person will go ahead and accept the posture of the Pope
 kinvadanti ke anusaar vastav main vah vyakti phelis pereti tha jisane 1585 main pope chunaa gaya
 There are many such stories about Nostradamus, but there is no evidence for any of them
 nastredamas kii bhavishyavaaniyan kii khyaati sun france kii maharani catherine ne apane bacchon kaa bhavishya jaanane kii ichha jaahir kii
 Nostradamus had known by his own wish that both the children of the Queen would be fulfilled at a young age, but could not dare to tell the truth, and offered their words in symbolic verses
 isak prakaar vah apni baat bhi kah gaye or maharani ke man ko koi chot bhi nahin pahunchi
 Since then, Nostradamus decided that he would express his prophecies in the same way
 1550 ke baad nastredamas ne chikitsak ke peshey ko chhod apana puraa dhyaan jyotish vidya kii sadhana par laga diya
 From the same year he also started taking out his annual Panchag

 The Justice Department of France was investigating against him whether he actually resorted to witchcraft

 The first era of Earth's history, which began with the creation of the Earth by accretion from a solar-nebula about 4
54 billion years ago, is called Hedion

 The age of the oldest rock found on Earth has been measured to be 4
0 Ga and the oldest detrital Zurcan particles found in some rocks have been estimated to be around 4
4 Ga, which is the period around the Earth's surface and the Earth's composition itself

 During the Haydian era, there was a continuous meteorite on the surface of the Earth and volcanic eruptions would also have been fierce due to the large amount of heat flow and the geothermal ratio

 Based on the calculations of volcanic eruptions found on other celestial bodies, it has been estimated that a time-zone called meteorite mass impact, called the "late Heavy Bombardment", began around 4
1 Ga
 This ended around 3
8 Ga with the end of the Hedion

 However, some researchers speculate that life might have occurred during the early Hedian period, about 4
4 Ga ago, and that they could survive their potential Late Heavy Bombardment period due to their being in hydrothermal pores below the Earth's surface
 saura mandal kaa nirmaan antartaarkeey dhul tathaa gas, jise saura niharika kaha jaataa he, ke ek ghoomte hue badal se hua, jo ki akashganga ke centre kaa chakkar laga rahaa tha

 lagbhag 4
6 Ga main, sambhawatah kisi nearesth adhinav taare kii aakraamak lahar ke kaaran saura niharika ke sikudne kii shuruyaat hui thi
 It is possible that such an aggressive wave has caused the nebula to start moving and receiving angular impulses
 dhire-dhire jab badal isaki ghurnan-gati ko badhaata gaya, to gurutvkarshan tathaa niskriyata ke kaaran yah ek sookshm-grahiy chakri ke aakaar main roopantarit ho gaya, jo ki iske ghurnan ke aksh ke lambavat thi
 Much of its weight accumulated at its center and began to heat up, but the angular impulses and collisions of other large remains created microscopic deflections that created a medium by which micro-planets of several kilometers in length were formed
 Construction began, which began to revolve around the center of the nebula
 padaarthon ke girane, ghurnan kii gati main vruddhi tathaa gurutvkarshan ke dabaav ne centre main atyadhik gatij urja kaa nirmaan kiya
 Through any other process at a speed that would be able to release this formation, its inability to transfer that energy to another location resulted in the heating of the center of the circle
 antat helium main hydrogen ke nabhikeey galan kii shuruyaat hui or antat, sankuchan ke baad ek tii tori taare ke jalane se surya kaa nirmaan hua
 Meanwhile, due to gravity, when matter began to condense around previously obstructed objects outside the gravitational limits of the new Sun, dust particles and the remaining micro-planetary circles began to separate into rings
 samay ke saath-saath bade khand ek-duusare se takraaye or bade padaarthon kaa nirmaan hua, jo antat sookshm-grah ban gayi
 It also included a collection located about 150 million kilometers from the center: Earth
 The planet was formed around 4
54 billion years ago and most of it was completed within 10-20 million years
 navnirmit tii tori taare kii saura vaayu ne chakri ke us adhikansh padaarth ko hataa diya, jo bade pindon ke rup main ghaneebhoot nahin hua tha
 Computer simulations show that from a microscopic planetary planetary planets can be formed, the distance between which is equal to the distance between the planets in our solar system

 The evolution of ancient-earth continued from accretion, until the interior of the micro-planet was sufficiently hot to melt heavy, ferrous metals
 aise drav dhaatu, jinke ghanatv ab ucchtar ho chukaa tha, prithvi ke bhaar ke centre main ekatrit hone lage
 As a result of this so-called iron holocaust, an ancient mantle and a center were separated in only 10 million years after the creation of the Earth, which formed the Earth's level structure and created the Earth's magnetic field
 puraatan-grah par padaarthon ke sanchayan ke dauraan, gasiy silica ke ek badal ne avashya hi prithvi ko gher liya hoga, jo baad main isaki sataha par thos chattaanon ke rup main ghaneebhoot ho gaya
 Now around this planet, an initial atmosphere of the solar-nebula's optical elements, most of which were made up of hydrogen and helium, remained, but the heat of solar-air and Earth must have removed this atmosphere
 jab prithvi kii vartmaan trigya main lagbhag 40% kii vruddhi hui to isamen parivartan hua or gurutvkarshan ne vaataavaran ko rokkar rakhaa, jisamen pani bhi shaamil tha
 Earth's relatively large natural satellite, the Moon, is unique
 apollo kaarykram ke dauraan, chandramaa kii sataha se chattaanon ke tukade prithvi par laae gaye
 Radiometric dating of these rocks has revealed that the age of the Moon is 4527 ± 10 million years, which is about 30 to 55 million years less than other bodies of the Solar System
 bhi kaha jaataa he, aakaar main vartmaan mangal grah se thodaa chota rahaa hoga
 It is likely that it was formed by accumulating matter at their fourth or fifth Lagrangian point, 150 million kilometers away from the Sun and Earth
 shaayad prarambh main uski kaksha sthir rahi hogi, lekin padaarth ke sanchayan ke kaaran jab theia kaa bhaar badhane laga, to vah asantulit ho gai hogi
 Theia's rotation-orbit around the Lagrangian point progressed and eventually collided with the Earth at about 4
533 Ga
 model yah darshaate hai ki jab is aakaar kaa ek sanghatkaari grah ek nimna kone par tathaa apekshaakrit dhimi gati se puraatan-prithvi se takaraayaa, to puraatan-prithvi tathaa prabhavakaari grah kii bhitari parat va bahari aavarnon se niklaa adhikansh padaarth antariksh main uchhal gaya, jahaan isamen se adhikansh prithvi ke chaaron ore sthit kaksha main bana rahaa
 Eventually this substance created the Moon
 haalanki, sanghatkaari grah ke dhaatu-sadrush tatv prithvi ke tatv ke saath milakar isaki sataha ke neeche chale gaye, jisase chandramaa dhaatu-sadrush tatwon se vanchit rah gaya
 Thus the concept of giant impact makes the moon's unusual structure clear
 sambhav he ki prithvi ke chaaron ore sthit kaksha main utsarjit padaarth do saptahon main hi ek pind ke rup main ghaneebhoot ho gaya ho
 Under the influence of its own gravity, this emitted material turned into a more circular body: the Moon

 In the energetic chemistry of early Earth, a molecule acquired the ability to make copies of itself — a replicator
 The copy was not always accurate: some copies were slightly different from their parents

 Although there is a difference in estimates, by about 3 Ga, perhaps something similar to the current oxygen-rich synthesis had developed, which made the sun's energy available not only to autotrophs, but also to those who eat it
 This type of synthesis, which by then had become the most common, used abundant carbon dioxide and water as raw materials and produced energy-rich organic molecules, along with the energy of sunlight
 
 iske alaava, is sanshleshan ke ek apshisht utpaada ke rup main oxigen utsarjeet kiya jaataa tha
 First, it is bound with limestone, iron and other minerals
 There is ample evidence of this in the abundant levels of iron-oxide found in the geological layers of this period

 Some oxygen was converted to ozone by the encouragement of inward ultraviolet radiation, which collected in a layer in the upper part of the atmosphere
 ozone parat ne parabangnee vikiran kii ek badi maatra, jo ki kisi samay vaataavaran ko bhed leti thi ko avashoshit kar liya or yah aaj bhi aisa karti he
 This led the cells to eventually form colonies on the surface of the oceans: without the ozone layer, ultraviolet radiation bombarding the surface would have caused unsustainable levels of mutation in the exposed cells

 The smaller cell replicated within the larger cell
 sheeghra hi, badi koshika va uske bheetar sthit choti koshikaon ke bich ek sthir sahjivita viksit ho gai
 Over time, the host cell acquired some of the genes of the small cell, and now these two types became interdependent: the larger cell could not survive without the energy produced by the smaller cells and the smaller ones on the other hand Cells could not survive without the raw materials provided by the large cell

 Some of these started living in colonies and respectively some division of labor took place; For example, it is possible that the cells of the periphery have taken somewhat different roles from the inner cells

 Prior to that time, reconstructions could not rely on similarities seen in the periods or coasts of oceanic surfaces, but only on geological observations and paleomagnetic data

 It is highly likely that Rodinia was not the first supercontinent and many older supercontinents have also been proposed
 iskaa arth yah he ki vartmaan plate tectonic jaisi prakriyaayein proterosoik ke dauraan bhi sakriy rahi thim
 After the dissolution of Rodinia around 800 Ma, it is possible that the continents rejoined around 500 Ma

 The end of the Proterozoic period saw at least two snowball meanings, which were so severe that the surface of the oceans would have completely frozen

 adhikansh puramausamavigyaniyon kaa maananaa he ki supercontinent rodenia ke nirmaan se in sheet ghatnaon kaa koi na koi sambandh avashya he
 As Rodinia was focused on equinoxes, chemical weathering rates increased and carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere
 chunki CO2 ek mahatvapurn greenhouse gas he, atah puri prithvi par mausam thanda ho gaya
 Similarly, during Snowball Earth most of the continental surface was permanently frozen by ice, which again reduced chemical weathering, leading to the end of glaciation

 If there is a connection between the terrible ice ages and the increase in diversity of life, it is not yet clear, but it does not appear coincidental

 In organisms such as snails, echinoderms, cranoids, and arthropods, the development of solid body parts, such as armor, skeletons, or external skeletons, made preservation and bacterialization of such forms of life much easier than in their Proterozoic ancestors
 yahi kaaran he ki puraane yugon kii tulana main cambrian tathaa uske baad ke jivan ke bare main bahut adhik jaankaree uplabdh he
 The boundary between the Cambrian and the Ordovician is identified by a large-scale mass extinction, with some new groups completely disappeared

 bhartiya sangh kaa avibhajya ang hone ke kaaran kerala kii aarthik vyavastha ko rashtriya aarthik vyavastha se pruthak karnaa uchit nahin he
 Nevertheless, Kerala's economic system has its own specialties
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas kii aadharbhoot soochna ke anusaar kerala kii uplabdhiyaan prashansaneey he
 Among the basic elements of human resource development are notable - lower population growth rate than other states of India, higher than national average density, higher age-rate, critical health consciousness, lower infant mortality, higher literacy, primary education Publicity, higher education facilities etc
 are favorable for economic progress
 parantu utpaadan kshetra main mandi, unchi berojgaare dar, badhata bazaar-bhav, nimna pratishirsh aamadani, upabhokta vaad kaa prabhaav aadi ke kaaran kerala kii arth-vyavastha jatil hoti ja rahi he
 Kerala can be compared to South Korea, Malaysia, China etc
 in terms of long age rate
 kintu ve teenon kerala se bhinn desh hai or aarthik vikaas ke path par agrasar hai
 Although according to the indicators of human resource development, Kerala is the leader among Indian states
 bhootkaal main kerala kii prati vyakti aay dar rashtriya aay dar se neeche thi
 While the economic system of Kerala exhibits the qualities of development
 assi ke dashak ke ant main kerala kaa aarthik vikaas ausat rashtriya aarthik vikaas kii dar se aage nikal gaya he
 This development is still going on
 kintu maatr isi se rajya kii sthiti majboot nahin banati
 The adverse effects of globalization have eliminated agriculture and other traditional sectors
 in kshetron main vigat chah - saat varshon se vikaas nahin ho rahaa he
 But now this situation has started changing, which is auspicious
 kerala ko aisa aarthik vikaas praapt karnaa he jo nyayanishth sthai tathaa avilamb ho
 Also, in the policy adopted in the field of development, there is no attempt to reduce government intervention or to reduce social welfare expenditure
 swatantry purv tiruvitankur, kochi, malbar kshetron kaa vikaas aadhunik kerala kii aarthik vyavastha kii prishth bhoomi he
 The geographical and natural features provide the economic system of Kerala with the diversity of natural wealth and labor-related diversity
 kerala teen pramukh bhugolic kshetron main banta he
 The coastal area is the most densely populated area
 yahan kii urvar mitti, nadi tat kshetra, jhilein aadi machhlee utpaadan, chaaval, nariyal tathaa saag - subjiyon kii kheti ke liye upyukt he
 Coconut, rice, tapioca, betel nut trees, cashew trees, rubber, pepper, ginger etc
 are cultivated in the regions between the mountainous and seaside areas
 purvi pahari kshetra main coffee, chaay, rabad kii kheti aupniveshik kaal se chalati chali aa rahi he
 In the middle of the 20th century, mass communication and establishment took place in the eastern mountainous region, which led to the development of the economic system of Kerala
 kerala main krishi khadyann or niryaat kii janevaali fasalon ke liye bilkul upyukt he
 The export crops have increased due to governance and trade
 kayar udyog, lakdi udyog, khaadya tel utpaadan aadi bhi krishi par aadhaarit hai
 Simultaneously, large industries that make the base of metals, chemicals, engineering etc
 have also started developing
 in kshetron main saarvajanik tathaa nijee pratishthan kaary kar rahe hai
 Coir production, workmanship, handloom etc
 are the traditional occupations of Kerala
 phir bhi yah kahana uchit nahi ki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha maatr krishi adhaarit he
 The notable aspect of Kerala's economic development is neither the agricultural sector considered as a primary sector nor the industry sector with various production-making
 aarthik vikaas kaa mukhya pahalu teesraa kshetra he jise seva - kshetra kaha jaataa he
 Majority of Kerala income and employment is received from here
 kerala praayah sabhi kshetron main bharat ke anya rajyon ke aage batch rahaa he, saadharantah koi bhi rajya pratham, dwitiya or tritiy kshetron ko paar karke hi aarthik vikaas ke ucch sopan par arurh ho saktaa he
 Against this economic principle, by reaching the first area and the second area in the third area, Kerala can take place in front of developed countries in mortality, literacy, woman age etc
 kam pratishirsh aay tathaa unchi unchi berojgaare ko poonji banaakar kerala kaise yah sthiti praapt kar sakaa yah anuttarit prashn sa rahata he
 No other state of India could attract the attention of the world in this way
 aarthik kshetra main hi nahin balki rajnatik, saamaajik evam saanskrithik kshetron main bhi jo vikaas kerala main hua he uski charchaa viksit deshon main hoti rahati he
 The progress of Kerala's economic system in the late 1980s was also discussed abroad with the name Kerala Model
 is udhaaharan ko lekar aaj bahut se prashn uthaaye jate hai
 Many economists doubt its sustainability
 19 veen shatabdi se sarkaar ne ek samaaj kalyaan niti apanaai he or uske karyanvayan ke antargat aadharbhoot suvidhaon ke liye sarkaar jo kharch karti aa rahi he vahi kerala ke saamaajik vikaas kaa mukhya strot he
 Apart from this, the amount of money received from non-resident Kerala from other regions of India and abroad, especially in the Gulf region, is also the reason for this development
 aadhunik kerala kii aarthik vyavastha main apravasi keraliyon kaa mahaan yogadan he
 For the development of the economic system, the budget of 2007 - 2008 presents some working methods

 jaisaa ki pehle bataaya ja chukaa he ki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha krishi samskruti se seva samskruti kii ore unmukh hoti hui vikaas kar rahi he
 Kerala occupies a prominent place in India's agricultural economy
 kerala ke krishi jivan ko nirdhaarit karanevaale tatv hai : - vishisht prakritik kshetra, vividh prakaar kii mitti or jalwaayu
 The major crops of Kerala are - rice, coconut, various varieties of pulses, rubber, betel nut, cardamom, coffee, tea, cashew, tapyoca, black pepper, ginger, turmeric, cocoa, cloves, nutmeg etc
 yahan par aalu, pyaaj aadi uttar bhartiya fasalein bhi utpann kii jaati hai
 Rubber, coffee, cardamom, tea etc
 are considered as farm crops
 duusari prakaar kii fasalein mukhyatah un krishak pariwaron ke paas he jo krishi ko aajeevika rup main apanaae hue hai
 The agricultural sector of Kerala is facing many crises, including the acute crisis in the production of both rice and coconut
 aaj kerala ko chaaval tathaa subjiyon keliye duusare rajyon par ashrith rahanaa pad rahaa he
 Not only this, the expansion of agricultural land has also decreased
 krishi bhoomi main mitti bharkar zamin banane kaa jo kaal chal rahaa he vah kerala ko gambhir sankat kii ore dhakel rahaa he
 Although they have been made coconut gardens by putting soil in the fields, the production of coconut has not increased
 1992 - 1993 main nariyal kaa utpaadan prati hectares 5843 tha jo 2000 main hectares 5638 ho gaya
 Due to debt load, destruction of crops, fall in prices, life of farmers has become difficult
 atah sarkaar krishi package tathaa rin aashwaasan ayog aadi kaa gathan karke krishi ke punaruddhar kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 The history of Kerala's agriculture begins with the new stone age
 punam krishi jaisi aadim krishi reetiyaan pracheen kaal main prachlit thim
 The tribals had their personal agricultural practices
 pracheen krishi samskruti ke abhinn ang the, krishi ke vibhinn aujaar deshi beej, beej sangrakshan kii paddatiyaan, krishi kaal, bhinn prakaar kii krishi bhumiyaan or krishi se jude reeti-rivaaz, krishi anushthan, krishi - utsav, krishi geet aadi
 Kerala has a large repository of indigenous knowledge related to agriculture
 kerala main vishesh krishi kshetra hai, ye hai - kuttnad, palakkad, kantallur, nelliampati aadi
 Other notable elements in the agriculture sector are small water irrigation schemes, reservoir development schemes, etc
 machhlee paalan or pashu paalan aadi bhi krishi kshetra ke pramukh kaary hai
 In the new stone age man had moved towards agriculture and animal husbandry
 un dinon manushya ke paas do prakaar ke hathiyaar the - pathar se bane farse or ped kii lakdi se bani laathiyaan
 The new stone age must have been agricultural in Kerala as well, because sharp-edged stones have been obtained from some areas of the Sahyadris
 vaynad ke thirunelli tathaa bawalippuzha ke tat par se tathaa pootati naamak sthaan se jo prastar farse praapt hue ve isi prastar yug ke hai
 Animal husbandry and farming by trimming the hillsides of the hills were the lifestyle of the new stone age farmers
 pashchimi ghat ke isi tarah ke sthanon par sambhawatah naveen prastar yugin krishi rahi hogi
 In this era, paddy, fruits, kandamul etc
 would have gained prominence in food
 dakshin bharat main isa se ek hazaar varsh purv lohe kaa upyog shuru hua tha
 The Loh era must have started in Kerala too
 mahaprastar yugin khanan se krishi ke kshetra main hue parivartan bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Iron hoe, shovels, large pottery used for the preservation of seeds have also been found in these excavations
 sanghamakaleen saahitiyik kritiyaan, jo maha prastar yug kii maani jaati hai, utpaadan prakriya ko vistaar se pratipaadit karti hai
 The Sanghamic compositions are related to the production process which also gives details of various tribes
 un dinon krishi ko aajeevika banaanevaale log vellalar kehalaate the
 Vellalars are not considered as distinct caste divisions in Kerala
 yahan krishakon ko kisi jati vishesh varg kaa nahin mana gaya he
 Later, the people of the waiter and ire class also started doing agricultural work
 nadi taton kii urvartaa dekhakar waiter, ir, kurvar aadi log vahaan jaakar bas gayi
 Later, they came to be known as plowlers and pullers
 'pulam' shabd kaa arth bhoomi he
 The agricultural region was called 'mainpulum' and the hilly regions around it where agriculture is not done were called 'vanapulam'
 'menpulam' aadim krishi ke vikaas ko suchit karata tha
 Although Sangham literature provides a detailed description of agriculture, there is no mention of the result of production in them
 yah bhi spasht nahin he ki us kaal kii krishi vishaal aabaadi kaa paalan poshan kar sakati thi ki nahin
 The concept of division of the five 'tinkal' forms of the Sangham period also presents the picture of the ancient farmers - life
 krishi ke itihaas kaa aglaa charan buddha, jain, brahman aadi dharm ke logon ke kerala aagaman ke baad kaa he
 Buddhism inspired agriculture
 jab brahman nadi tat par bas gayi to unhone krishi par adhikaar jamaa liya
 The bulk of the farms came to the villages of Brahmins
 brahmanon kaa khetibari par aadhipaty jamane kaa kaaran unka jyotish gyaan tha jiske aadhaar par unhone krishi kii yojana taiyaar kii or uskaa niyantran bhi apane paas rakhaa
 They established their hold on the land by establishing temples
 is tarah unhone sidhe krishi na karte hue bhi krishi utpaadan par niyantran praapt kar liya
 This also brought about a change in the production system
 ushvar naamak jan, saamaanya vibhaag ke log, anek upavibhaagon main bant gayi
 Karlar, Kutikal, Attiyar became the head sub divisions
 pramukh krishak karalar kahalaane lage
 Due to the name of the temples of agricultural land, the Karlar became subject to the Brahmins
 kheton main rahane waalon ko kutimaa athwa kutiyanma kaha gaya

 The term Jeeva is used in biology to refer to all life-embedded beings
 jain granthon, hindu dharm grantho, bauddhadharm evam sufi dharm grantho main is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya hai

 In which a cell is found, it is a unicellular organism; If there is more than one cell, that organism is called multicellular organism
 manushya kaa sharir vishesh utakon or angon main baanta hota he, jisamen koshikaon ke kai arabon kii rachana main bahukoshikeey jeev hote hai
 Brahm is such an extraterrestrial power that pervades the entire universe, particle by minute
 yahi lokottar shakti jab sansar kii rachana karti he; sristi kaa pravartan karti he; praaniyon kaa sangrakshan karti he; unka sanhaar karti he to ise ishwar kii sangya praapt ho jaati he
 The word Brahma is a sign of the powerful and non-post-matter elements

 Kabir also talks about the same thing- jal main kumbh kumbh main jal he baahar bheetar pani
 This is Kathaongiani at the time of split water
 
 That is, there is a clay pot in the well
 ghade main jal he
 As long as the pot has power, it is different from water, but when the separate power of the pit ends, then it becomes an inseparable part of the entire water
 yahi sthiti jeev or brahm kii he
 Only a creature caught by the chain of ignorance has the illusion of its power separate from Brahm
 jab agyaan kaa pardaa hat jaataa he, tab jeev ko yah prakaash miltaa he ki vah to swayan brahm he
 In the Upanishads such utterances such as Sohamamsmi, Sivaohamma, Aham Brahmasmi, Ayamatabrahma, Tattvamsi Jeeva and Brahm's Announcement
 bauddhadharm main nity satta kaa nishedh kiya jaataa he
 In this religion it is believed that everything is moving, dynamic

 By denying eternal power, divine power cannot be recognized because both have elemental dissonance
 isi visangati ke kaaran bauddhadharm main ishwar jaisi kisi nity satta kaa nishedh kiya jaataa he
 By the way, Buddhism believes in the hereafter

 In this religion, the Tathagata Buddha and such Bodhisattvas are worshiped who fall into the state of nirvana

 In this religion, Jaganniyanta, Jagatastrishtajaisi is not believed in any extraterrestrial power

 Twenty four Tirthankaras are considered as arhat in this religion

 Even in Jainism, the question of the distinction between God and Jiva does not arise because there is power of Jiva here but there is lack of power of external world
 sufi dharm main bhi ishwar or jeev main abhed he
 Mansoor was a Sufi
 usne analhak kaa udghosh kiya
 Anālahāka means i am Brahman
 spashtat:sufi drushti bhi aupnishadik drushti ke samaan he
 Here too, there is incommensurability between Brahma and Jiva
 yahaan bhi ishwar or jeev ke bich bhed kaa prashn nahin uthta
 Followers of the monotheistic formalistic tradition, Shramana tradition and Sufi tradition follow the path of knowledge
 gyatavya he ki bhaktimaarg kaa pathik sevak-sevy bhav apanaakar param lakshya kii ore agrasar hota he
 The wayfarer on this path considers himself a servant and a god

 Tikrit of that era was notorious for his grunts

 Child Saddam always kept an iron rod near him in fear of being beaten by children
 or jab-tab isse jaanwaron kii pitayee kiya karata tha
 As a teenager, he became a rebel and jumped into the ongoing nationalist movement to overthrow the British-controlled monarchy

 In 1956, he joined the Bath Socialist Party

 al vakar unke chachere bhai bhi lagate the
 He became a key member of Al Bakr's Revolutionary Command Council
 sach baat to yah bhi he ki vahi bakar kii satta ke asli kartta-dhartta the
 Initially, he was very liberal but slowly came back to his true form
 bakar biimaar the or satta kii chaabuk kaa vahi istemaal karte the
 He created his own image in the Sunni world and continued to create his own group behind the scenes
 16 july 1979 ko al bakar ko satta se hataa kar vah swayan iraqi gaddi par baith gaye
 If he wanted, he could have given this change of power as a natural violence-free coup but he had to give the message that now Saddam has come to power, so rebellious people should be careful
 unhone ek ke baad ek 66 deshadrohiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 In the early years of his rule, Saddam Hussein was dear to America
 unhone iran se yuddh mol liya or america se madad lee
 Ronald Regan helped him

 With this, he came into the eyes of American power establishments and soon the Gulf War started

 For this reason, America has repeatedly felt that it can become a challenge again

 ise kashmir ke duusare yuddh ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 a dispute has been going on between India and Pakistan since the Partition for the right over the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 1947 main bharat-pakistan ke bich pratham yuddh bhi kashmir ke liye hi hua tha
 Pakistan started this battle by sending its soldiers as infiltrators in the hope that the people of Kashmir would revolt against India
 is abhiyaan kaa naam pakistan ne yudhbhiyaan jibraltar rakhaa tha
 Thousands of people from both sides were killed in this war lasting five months
 is yuddh kaa ant sanyukt raashtra ke dwaara yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa ke saath hua or taashkand main donon pakshon main samjhauta hua
 Most of this battle was fought by the army on both sides

 In the war, infantry and armored troops took part in many campaigns with the help of the Air Force
 dono paksho ke bich hue anek yudhon kii tarah is yuddh kii anek jaankariyaan donon pakshon ne saarvajanik nahin kii
 Since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, there were many issues going on between India and Pakistan, although the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was the biggest in it, but there were other border disputes, the most prominent of which was the Rann of Kutch, which was a It was a barren area, was on the partition of 20 march 1965 main pakistan ke dwaara jaanboojh kar kuccha ke ran main jhadpen shuru kar di gayi
 Initially they included only the Border Security Force, but later the army of both the countries also joined the war
 On 1 June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson stopped the fight between the two sides by a fair arbitral court to resolve the dispute
 Established is nyaayalay ne kuccha ke ran kii kareeb 900 varg kilometre jagah pakistan ko de di
 However, Pakistan claimed 3500 square kilometers
 
 Encouraged by the success of the Kutch run, Pakistani politicians, especially the then Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, pressured the President and the Chief of Army Staff General Ayub Khan to order an attack on Kashmir
 bharat us samay china se yuddh haar chukaa tha or unka maananaa tha ki bharat us samay yuddh karne kii sthiti main nahin tha
 Apart from this, Bhutto and other generals agreeing with his view, Yahya Khan and Tikka Khan also believed that the people of Kashmir were willing to merge with Pakistan by liberating from India and would revolt in support of them when the soldiers were disguised as infiltrators
 aakhir general ayub khan dabaav main aa gayi or unhone gupt sainik abhiyaan oparation jibraltar kaa aadesh de diya
 The main objective of this campaign was to incite rebellion among the people of Kashmir and damage the Indian communication system and transport system
 pakistan ke ghuspaithiyon ko jaldi hi pahchaan liya gaya or vidroh karne ke bajaay janata ne unki soochna bhartiya sainikon ko de di or yah abhiyaan purnatah vifal ho gaya
 On August 5, 1965, between 26000 and 3 xxrep 4 0 Pakistani soldiers crossed the Line of Control in the dress of the local population of Kashmir and entered Indian Kashmir
 bhartiya sena ne sthaneey aabaadi se isaki soochna paakar 15 agast ko niyantran rekha ko paar kiya

 With the help of artillery, he captured three important hill stations

 The Indians were successful in bringing additional troops and India entered 8 km into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and captured the Haji Pir Pass

 The expedition came under occupation of the infiltrators of Gibraltar by the Indians and the expedition failed
 yahi nahin, pakistan kii kaman ko lagane laga ki pakistani kashmir kaa mahatvapurn shahar mujaffarabad ab bharatiyo ke kabje main jane hi vaala he
 Pakistan launched a new campaign Operation Grand Slam to ease the pressure on Muzaffarabad
 1 sitambar 1965 ko pakistan ne grand slam naamak ek abhiyaan ke tahat samrik drushti se mahatvapurn shahar akhnur jammu or kashmiripar kabje ke liye akraman kar diya
 The purpose of this campaign was to break the Kashmir Valley's connectivity with the rest of India so that its logistics and communication system was disrupted
 pakistan ke is akraman ke liye bharat taiyaar nahin tha or pakistan ko baari sankhya main sainiko or behatar kism ke tanko kaa laabh mil rahaa tha
 In the beginning, India had to face heavy damage, on which the Indian Army used an aerial attack, in response, Pakistan attacked the air base of Punjab and Srinagar
 yuddh ke is charan main pakistan atyadhik behatar sthiti main tha or is apratyaashit hamale se bhartiya kheme main ghabrahat fail gayi thi
 The passing of Akhnoor into the hands of the Pakistani Army could have posed a threat to the Kashmir Valley of India
 grand slam ke vifal hone kii do vajahe thi sabase pehali or badi vajah yah thi ki pakistan kii sainik kaman ne jeet ke muhane main par apane sainik commander ko badal diya aise main pakistani sena ko aage badhane main ek din kii deree ho gayi or un 24 ghanto main bharat ko akhnur kii raksha ke liye atirikt sainik or saamaan laane kaa mauka mil gaya khud bharartiya sena ke sthaneey commander bhuchakke the ki pakistan itani aasaan jeet kyon chhod rahaa he
 Despite the delay of a day, the army chief of the Western Command of India knew that Pakistan was in a very good position and to stop it, he gave a proposal to the then Chief of Army Staff General Chaudhary to open a new front in the Punjab border and attack Lahore
 Be given
 general choudhary is baat se sahamat nahin the lekin tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shashtri ne unki baat ansuni kar is hamale kaa aadesh de diya
 On September 6, India crossed the international border and attacked the Western Front and made the official start of the war
 6 sitambar ko bharat kii 15ve paidal sainya ikai ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke anbhavi major general prasad ke netratv main icchhogil nahar ke pashchimi kinare main pakistan ke bade hamale kaa saamana kiya
 The Ichogil Canal was the de facto border of India and Pakistan
 is hamale main khud major general prasad ke kafile par bhi hamalaa hua or unhe apana vaahan chhod kar bhaagna padaa
 India succeeded in crossing the canal near Barki village in retaliation

 Meanwhile, Pakistan attacked Khemkaran to reduce the pressure on Lahore and captured it
 In return, India attacked Bedi and its surrounding villages
 6 sitambar ko lahore par hamale main bhartiya sena ke pratham paidal sainya khand ke saath dwitiya bakhtarband upkhand ke teen tanks daste shaamil the
 They immediately crossed the border and reached the Ichogil Canal, the Pakistan Army deployed defense teams on the bridges, the bridges which could not be saved were blown up, this move of Pakistan stopped the Indian army moving forward
 jat regiment kii ek ikai 3 jat ne nahar paar karke dograi or batapore par kabja kar liya
 On the same day, the Pakistan Army, with the help of armored unit and air force, made a large counter attack on the 15th section of the Indian Army, although it caused only minor damage to the 3 Jats but the 15th segment had to retreat and its logistics and weapons vehicles were severely damaged
 bhartiya sena ke bade adhikario ko jamini halaat kii sahi jaankaree nahin thi atah unhone is ashanka se ki 3 jat ko bhi baari nuksaan hua he use peeche hatane kaa aadesh de diya isse 3 jat ke kaman aadhikari ko badi niraashaa hui or baad main unhe dograi par phir kabja karne ke liye badi keemat chukaani padi
 On 8 December 1965, a squad of 5 Maratha Light Infantry was sent to strengthen the Rajasthan Military Force stationed at Munabav, a strategically important town

 5 3 Gurkhas and 954 heavy artillery squad sent to help Maratha could not reach due to heavy attack of Pakistani Air Force and Tran coming from Barmer after taking logistics also became an attack near Garda Road Rail Base 10 September Munabao was captured by Pakistan
 9 sitambar ke baad kii ghatnaon ne dono deshon kii senaao ke sabase garvit khando kaa dambh chur chur kar diya
 The 1st Armored Division of India, called the Pride of the Indian Army, attacked in the direction of Sialkot
 chhavinda main pakistan kii apekshaakrit kamjor 6 bakhtarband khand ne buree tarah haraa diya bhartiya sena ko kareeb kareeb 100 tanks gavaane pade or peeche hatane par majaboor hona padaa
 Encouraged by this, Pakistan's army attacked the Indians and entered further into the Indian border
 apane antim aakraamak ke liye pakistan apane pehla bakhtarband divijan or 11vaan infantry divijan ke saath amritsar par kabje ke iraade se khemkaran par hamalaa kar diya
 According to him, after Amritsar, according to the statement from Jalandhar and then President Ayub Khan, Delhi would be the next target
 pakistani sena khemkaran se aage babbti hi ki asal uttar gaanv ) ke paas bharat kaa chauthaa mountain divijan, 7 mountain brigade, 62 mountain brigade, shermen tanks se susajjit deccan horse, apane anya divijan ke saath yuddh ke liye khada tha
 And here, between them, the second largest tank battle was fought after World War, in which Pakistan suffered a tremendous defeat
 usne apane 97 tanks kho diye, jisamen 72 paton tanks shaamil the; iske alaava 32 tanks chalati haalat main kabja kar liya gaya
 Where before, the advancing Pakistani army lost in the war of the real north, the balance of war was tilted in favor of India
 iske baad yah jagah america main bane paton naam ke pakistani tanko ke upar paton nagar ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war
 is samay tak yuddh main tehraav aa gaya tha or dono desh apane dwaara jite hue ilaako kii raksha main zyada dhyaan de rahe the
 In the battle 3000 Indian Army and 3800 Pakistani Army soldiers were martyred
 bharat ne yuddh main 710 varg kilometre ilaake main or pakistan ne 210 varg kilometre ilaake main kabja kar liya tha
 The Indian state had fertile areas of Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir, while Pakistan occupied the barren areas of Sindh and Chamba
 is yuddh main aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bhartiya vaayu sena evam pakistani vaayu sena ke vimaanon ne ek dusre kaa muqabla kiya
 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke paas badi sankhya main hoker hunter, bharat main nirmit folland nait, de havilland vempaire, i i canberra bamavarshak or mig-21 kii ek squadran thi
 The Pakistani Air Force's fadter planes were 102 F-86F sabers and 12 F-104 starfighters, and 24 B-57 Canberra bombers
 sangharsh ke dauraan bharat or pakistan vaayu senaaon kaa anupaat 5:1 tha
 However, the two air forces were similar in the war, as most of the Indian Air Force was stationed east to avoid the possibility of China entering the war
 pakistani vimaan zyaadaatar america the, jabaki bharat ke paas soviet va europea vimaanon kaa mila jula bedaa tha
 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better
 yuddh main pakistan kii nan0 19 squadran kaa netritv karne vaale air commander sajaad haidar ke anusaar- haalaanki bhartiya vayusena ke vempaire fiter vimaan F-86 saibar ke mukaable puraane or kamazor the, lekin hunter vimaan shakti evam gati donon main hi unase behatar the
 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"
 pakistan vayusena kaa F-104 starfiter upmahadweep main us samay kaa sabase tej gati kaa fiter vimaan tha or use praayah "pakistan vayusena kaa garv" kaha jaataa tha
 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft
 To fight
 atah ye us samay ke maahaul ke upyukt nahin the
 "the Indian Air Force was worried because of Starfighter, but they did not prove to be as effective in combat as the slower but more agile, Folland Nat Fighter
 phir bhi saibar or nats ke bich chale dwand yuddh main supersonic gati ke saath, saibar kahi zyada safal rahaa
 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them
 pakistani vayusena kaa daawa tha ki usne bharat ke 104 vimaan giraae or apane 19 vimaan khoe, jabaki bhartiya vayusena ne daawa kiya ki unhone pakistan ke 73 vimaan giraae or apane 35 vimaan khoe
 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time
 pakistan vayusena ke keval ek squadran ko khone ke daavon ko, bhartiya sutron ne nakaarte hue bataaya he ki, pakistan ne shuruuaati yuddh ke 10 dinon ke bheetar hi indonesia, iraq, iran, turki or china se atirikt vimaan hasil karne kii maang kii thi
 According to independent sources, the PAF had lost some 20 aircraft while the Indians had lost 60–75 aircraft
 pakistan ne yuddh kii samaapti tak apni 17 pratishat agrim pankti kii takat kho di, jabaki bharat kaa nuksaan 10 pratishat se bhi kam tha
 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent
 1965 ke yuddh main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad tinkon ke sabase bade yuddh lade gaye
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971
