 'don' is an underworld criminal in Mumbai, who is looking for both the Mumbai Police and Interpol
 interpol kii 'most wanted' aparaadhiyon kii suchi main shaamil don har baar police ko chakma dekar bhaag nikalne main safal ho jaataa he
 Due to his ruthless nature, Don has other enemies besides the police
 pramukhtah don ne ek baar apane hi ek sahakarmi, ramesh kii hatya kar di thi, jiske baad uski mangetar 'kamini' tathaa bahan 'roma' don ke dushman ban gaye
 Kamini tries to seduce Dawn, so that the police come and capture Dawn, but Dawn manages to escape by taking Kamini hostage, and Kamini dies in this entire development
 kamini kii bhi mrityu se acroshit roma apane bal kataa leti he, or judo tathaa karate sikhkar don ke giroh main shaamil ho jaati he, taaki mauka paakar vah don ko maar de
 After several unsuccessful attempts to capture Dawn, the police finally succeed, and DCP d'silva is almost caught by Dawn, that Dawn dies, and d'silva's attempt to reach Dawn's boss
 The dream remains incomplete
 iske baad di'silva don ko vahiin dafna detaa he

 Jasjeet was arrested by DCP d'silva; The reason jj's wife died, and her two children went missing
 uske donon bacchon, deepu tathaa munni kaa laalan-paalan isi bich vijay kar rahaa tha
 Vijay takes a 'red diary' of Don, and goes to meet DCP d'silva
 roma bhi uske saath jaati he, or vahaan use akelaa paakar vah us par hamalaa kar detii he

 vijay vah diary di'silva ko de detaa he, or use padhakar unhen pataa chalata he ki don ke bos kaa naam varadhan he, parantu uske bare main isse adhik jaankaree us diary main nahin likhi hoti

 Vijay is being sent to a high-security prison by a truck, and he manages to escape from the truck
 iske baad vah swayan ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye roma kii madad se khud koi tarkeeb sochane lagata he
 Vijay gets badly involved in this development, as the police refuse to believe that he is Vijay, and at the same time, Don's underworld gang realizes that he is not really Don
 upar se vah laal diary, jo usne disipi di'silva ko di thi, use jasjit chura le jaataa he
 Vijay succeeds in dodging both the police and Narang, the current ringleader of the underworld gang, with the help of Roma, and attempts to return to his old life
 vijay interpol ke afasar, aar ke maalik se milane kaa aagrah karata he, or unase kuch samay kii maang karata he, taaki vah apni begunaahi kaa pramaan laa sake
 He then discovers that what he perceived to be the boss of the Interpol officer r until now, is actually the boon, who kidnaps the real R's boss and is disguised by them
 use yah bhi pataa chalata he ki disipi di'silva kii hatya bhi varadhan ne hi kii thi
 Vijay tries to tell this to other police officers, but they do not believe his words
 iske baad vijay varadhan ke sabhi gundon se swayan ladata he, or isi bich roma bhi vah laal diary dhundhakar le aati he
 In the same battle, a goon snatches the diary from Roma and burns it
 police un logon ko chaaron taraf se gher leti he, or us samay vijay apni jeb se laal dieriy nikaalkar unhen bataata he, kii jo diary jalaai gai, vah vastav main nakli thi
 Don gives the diary to the police, declaring him innocent and removing all charges on him
 asli aar ke maalik ko chhudaakar police varadhan ko giraftaar kar leti he, or vijay roma, jasjit, deepu tathaa munni ke saath apni puraani jindagi main laut jaataa he

 ospfv3, which runs on ipv6, no longer supports protocol-internal authentication
 Instead, it relies on ipv6 protocol security
 OSPF ke tisare sanskaran main ipv4 protocol ke karyanvayan ke liye sanshodhan die gaye hai
 Except for virtual links, all neighboring exchanges use ipv6 link-local addressing
 ipv6 protocol sabanet par aadhaarit hone ke bajaae prati link chalata he
 All IP prefix information has been removed from link-state advertisements and hello discovery packets to make the protocol essentially protocol independent
 ip-ipv6 main IP adressing kaa 128 bit tak karne ke baavzood kshetra tathaa router kii pahchaan abhi bhi 32-bit vailu par aadhaarit hai
 Routers in the same broadcast domain or point-to-point telecommunications links react by locating the proximal router, at each end

 OSPF uses both unicast and multicast to send "hello packets" and update the link state
 ek link state rooting protocol ke rup main, OSPF duusare routers ke saath rooting apadet lene / dene ke liye sambandh sthapit karata he
 In OSPF, neighboring tables are called adjacency tables
 ospfkevala sidhe jude hue routers ke saath sambandh banaata he basharte ki OSPF sahi dhang se vyavasthit ho
 Routers with which it makes connections must be in the same area with interfaces
 An interface can belong to only one region

 kshetra host tathaa network ke logical samooh hai, jis main network main interphes dwaara jude hue routers bhi shaamil hai
 Each region maintains a separate link state database that can be sent by the connected router to the rest of the network
 is prakaar ek kshetra kii topology kshetra ke baahar agyaat rahati he
 This reduces routing traffic between parts of an autonomous system
 kai "vishesh" kshetra ke prakaar paribhaashit kiye gayi hai: The backbone area is the core of an OSPF network
 anya sabhi kshetra isse jude hai or inter aria rooting bakabon aria se jude routers tathaa unase sambandhit kshetron dwaara hoti he
 It is the logical and physical structure of the 'OSPF domain' and is associated with all nonzero regions in the OSPF domain
 dhyaan den ki OSPF main autonomas system border router shabd is arth main aitihaasik he, ki kai OSPF domen samaan internet autonomas, RFC1996 main ek saath ho sakate hai
 The backbone area is responsible for the distribution of routing information between non-backbone regions
 bakabon kshetra aas paas hone chahiyein lekin inhen bhautik rup main aas paas hone kii jarurat nahin he
 Backbone contacts can be established by deploying virtual links
 sabhi OSPF kshetra bakabon kshetra se avashya jude hue hone chahiyein
 baharhaal, yah sambandh ek abhaasi link ke madhyam se ho saktaa he
 For example, suppose area 0

 tronsit kshetra banane ke liye, ek kshetra main tronsit visheshtaon kaa hona jaruri he isliye yah kisi bhi tarah se rukaawat paidaa karne vaala nahin ho saktaa
 The interruption zone is an area that does not receive route advertisements from the external autonomous system, and routing within the region is entirely based on a default route
 is se kshetra ke internal routers ke rooting databes kaa aakar chota ho jaataa he
 Modification of the basic concept of blockage areas has led to less obstruction zones
 iske alaava, system vendoron dwaara kai suvidhanusaar badlaav lagu kiye gaye hai, jaise puri tarah se rukaawat vaala kshetra or NSSA puri tarah se rukaawat vaala kshetra 
 donon cisco systams rooting upkaran kaa vistaar hai
 a less obstructed region is a type of obstruction zone that can capture the external routes of the autonomous system and transmit them to other regions, but still not receive AS external routes from other regions
 NSSA is an extended form of blockage zone that allows a limited amount of external routes into the blockage area
 banaata he jise tip 7 ke rup main janaa jaataa he jo keval ek NSSA kshetra main maujuud ho saktaa he
 An NSSA ASBR generates this LSA and an NSSA ABR router converts it into a Type 5 LSA that joins the OSPF domain
 ek kshetra ek saath kam rukaawat tathaa sampoorn rukaawat vaala ho saktaa he
 This occurs when an ASBR is placed at the end of a complete blockage at a practical location
 udhaaharan ke liye - nayi adhigrihith company ke saath
 aise maamle main, ASBR bahya rooton ko sampoorn rukaawat kshetra main bhejtaa he, or ve us kshetra main OSPF spikar ke liye uplabdh rahete hai
 In Cisco implementation, external routes can be summarized before being sent to the entire interrupt area
 saamaanya rup se, ASBR ko TSA-NSSA ko prakshepan nahin karnaa chahie, haalanki bahut hi saavdhaanee se dizin or sanchaalan ke saath simit vishesh maamalon main aisa ho saktaa he jinamein is tarah ke prakshepan kaa koi arth ho
 By declaring the entire interrupt area as NSSA, no external route can be entered from the backbone other than the default route
 External routes reach the area 0
0
0
0 via TSA-NSSA but no route other than the default route enters TSA-NSSA
 Routers of TSA-NSSA send all traffic to the ABR except for routes projected by ASBR
 ek transit kshetra main do yaa adhik OSPF border router hote hai or yah ek kshetra se duusare sameepvarti kshetra ko trephic bhejne main prayog kiya jaataa he
 The transit area does not generate this traffic and is not the destination of such traffic
 OSPF root laagat ko apni buniyadi rooting metric ke rup main prayog karata he, jo maanak dwaara paribhaashit ke liye kisi bhi maanak mulya jaise ki gati ke samaan nahin he, isliye network diziner dijin ke anuroop metric le saktaa he
 In practice, this is measured by the interface speed of a given route address, although special measurement factors are now required for networks as links faster than 100 Mbit / s are common
 cisco 10^8 / bandwidth metric kaa prayog karata he
 Therefore a 100mbit / s would cost 1, 10mbit / s would cost 10 and would be calculated in a similar way
 For links faster than 100mbit, the cost will be less than 1
 yadhyapi metrix kii tulana keval tab ho sakati he jab ve samaan prakaar ke hon
 metrix chaar prakaar ke hote hai, jinhen praathamikta ke kram main neeche soochibaddh kiya gaya he
 Regardless of metric, an intra-region route is always preferred over an inter-region route, and so is the case with other types
 OSPF-TE OSPF kaa vistrut rup he jo trephic ejineering kii gati ko tej karne tathaa ise non-ip network par prayog kii anumati detaa he 
 More information about the topology can be found from the OPAC LSA, which contains type-length-value information
 ye vistaar OSPF-TE ko puri tarah se data plane network ke band se baahar chalane kii anumati dete hai
 This means that it can also be used in non-ip networks such as optical networks
 OSPF-TE mukhyatah GMPLS networkon main ek topology kaa varnan karata he, jis par GMPLS path sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 The GMPLS then uses its own path setup and forwarding protocol using a map of the entire network
 RFC 3717 document IP ke liye optical root main kaam karte hai, jo OSPF tathaa IS-IS ke "rukaawat par aadhaarit" ekstansion par aadhaarit he
 OSPF defines the following types of routers: router ke prakaar ek OSPF prakriya kii visheshtaayen hai
 a router may have one or more OSPF processes
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek router jo ek se adhik kshetra se judaa he or jo ek duusare AS se jude BGP prakriya se root praapt karata he, ek ABR or ek ASBR, donon prakaar kaa he
 Each router has the ability to be identified, usually written in the dotted decimal format of the IP address
 is idi ek OSPF prakriya ke liye niojit honi chahie
 If not explicitly employed, the largest logical IP address will assume the router ID role
 agar koi logical / lupabek IP adress na ho to kisi sakriy fijical interphes kaa sabase bada IP adress router ID kii bhoomika grahan karegaa
 The router ID does not need to be a part of the subnet in the network and often does so to avoid confusion
 note: router prakaaron ko padhate samay decigneted router athwa byaap decigneted router se bhramit na hon jo ek router ke tatva hai na ki swayan router
 The ABR is a router that connects one or more OSPF regions to the main backbone network
 yah un sabhi kshetron, jinase yah judaa hua he, kaa ek sadsy mana jaataa he
 An ABR holds multiple copies of the link state database in memory, one for each region to which that router is connected
 ASBR ek router he jo ek se adhik AS se judaa he or jo duusare AS main routers ko rooting jaankaree bhejtaa he
 asbrs typically use non-igp routing protocols, or static routes, or both
 
 ASBR kaa prayog apane AS ke dwaara duusare As se praapt rooton ko vitarit karne main kiya jaataa he
 IR is a router with all interfaces in the same region
 bakabon routers : ye router OSPF bakabon kaa ek hissaa hai
 By definition, these also include all area border routers, as they provide routing information between regions
 haalanki, ek bakabon router ek aisa router bhi ho saktaa he jo keval duusare bakabon ek router se judaa ho tathaa isiilie kisi bhi kshetra kaa hissaa na ho 
 Note that: An area border router is always a backbone router, but a backbone router does not have to be an area border router
 ek decigneted router ek router interphes he jise sabhi routers ek vishesh multiexes network segment par chunate hai tathaa jise aam taur par broadcast multiexes mana jaataa he
 Special techniques, often vendor-dependent, can support DR processes on nonbroadcast multi-access media
 aamtaur par NBMA sabanet ke akele virtual circuit ko akele point tu point line main configar karnaa budhimatta he jiske liye implementation-dependent takneekein prayukt hoti hai
 Do not consider DR as an OSPF router type
 Some interfaces of a router may be designated, some backup designated and some non-designated
 yadi kisi sabanet par koi router DR yaa BDR nahin he to DR ko pehle chunaa jaataa he tathaa ek se adhik BDR hone par aglaa chunaav hota he
 The DR is selected based on the following predefined criteria
 DR kaa uddeshy rooting apadet ke liye strot uplabdh kara ke network trephic ko kam karnaa he
 The DR creates a complete topology table of the network and sends updates to other routers via multicast
 ek kshetra main sabhi routers DR ke saath ek gulam / maalik ke sambandh kaayam kar lete hai
 They only do this with the adjacent DR and BDR
 jab bhi router ek apadet bhejtaa he, yah DR or BDR ke multicast adress 224
0

 The DR then sends updates to all other routers in the field to the multicast address 224

 is tarah sabhi routers ko nirantar ek duusare ko apadet nahin karnaa padataa or iske bajaae ek hi strot se apane sabhi apadet praapt kar sakate hai
 The use of multicasting further reduces network load
 DR or BDR hameshaa taiyaar rahete hai / broadcast network par chune jate hai
 drs can also be selected on NBMA networks such as Frame Relay or ATM
 DR or BDR are not selected on point to point links as the two routers at one end of the link must be fully passed and the bandwidth between them cannot be further improved
 byaap decigneted router ek router he jo vartmaan decigneted router main samasya aane yaa us ke fel hone par decigneted router ban jaataa he
 The BDR is the second highest priority OSPF router at the time of the last election

 a DR and BDR are normally selected and function normally
 jaisaa ki 2328 RFC main varnit he, NBMA topology main OSPF ke liye nimnlikhit do aadhikarik prakaar hai: Cisco has defined three more types for OSPF in NBMA topology: mu dinemics sarvice vishleshak ko ek open sorce OSPF main 0-de samasya khojane kaa shrey diya gaya tha
 Other testing tools are also used extensively for utility and load or stress testing, such as equipment from Ixia Communication and Agilent Technologies
 OSPF vyapak rup se tainaat hone vaala pehla protocol he jo kuch second main ek network ko jod saktaa he or baadha rahit root kii guarantee detaa he
 It has many features that allow policies to be implemented during route launch so it should be used for local, load sharing and for importing select routes more than IS-IS
 iske vipareet IS-IS ko ek sthir network main loar overhad ke liye niojit kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa prayog aam taur par vyapaarik network se zyada ISP main hota he
 IS-IS has become the primary IGP for isps due to some historical accidents, but now isps, after first calculating the profit and loss of ISIS according to the requirements of a service provider, caused OSPF to be more effective with its features
 Can choose from jaisaa ki bataaya ja chukaa he, eksternal link par OSPF duusare igps se behatar lod shering kar saktaa he
 When an isp's default route is routed to OSPF as a Type 1 external route and multiple asbrs at the given external cost, other routers will move from their location to the asbrs with the least path cost
 This can be further improved by adjusting external costs
 iske vipareet, yadi alag alag isps se difolt maarg alag bahya laagat se, tip II eksternal rup main pravaahit hote hai, to kam laagat vaala difolt baahar jane kaa praathmik rasta ban jaataa he or or adhik laagat vaala sirf byaap ban jaataa he
