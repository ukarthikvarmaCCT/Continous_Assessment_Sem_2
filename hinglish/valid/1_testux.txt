 araajaktaa ek adarsh he jiskaa siddhant araajaktaavaad he
 Anarchism is the principle of efforts to establish justice in all human relations by ending the state by free and spontaneous cooperation between individuals, groups and nations
 araajaktaavaad ke anusaar kaarysvatantry jivan kaa gatyaatmak niyam he or isiilie uskaa mantavya he ki saamaajik sanghathan vyaktiyon ke kaary swatantry ke liye adhiktam avasar pradaan kare
 In human nature, there is such a power of self-regulation which can easily establish orderliness while remaining free from external control
 manushya par anushaasan kaa aropan hi saamaajik or naitik buraaiyon kaa janak he
 Therefore, the state and its other institutions dependent on violence cannot overcome these evils
 manushya swabhaavat: acha he, kintu ye sansthaayen manushya ko bhrasht kar detii hai
 Free from external control, the collective life of real freedom is possible mainly from small groups; Therefore the ideal of social organization is unionist
 suvyavasthit rup main araajaktaavaad ke siddhant ko sarvapratham pratipaadit karne kaa shrey stoik vichaardhaara ke pravarttak xeno ko he
 He emphasized on the establishment of a stateless society where absolute equality and freedom could develop the harmonies of human nature and establish universal harmony
 duusari shatabdi ke madhya main araajaktaavaad ke samyavaadee swaroop ke pravatrthak corpokreties ne rajya ke atirikt nijee sampatti ke bhi unmoolan kii baat kahi
 The ideas and organization of Christian philosophers and communities in the late medieval era expressed some clear anarchist tendencies, whose main claim was that one could be sin-free by establishing a direct mystic relationship with God
 aadhunik arth main vyavasthit dhang se araajaktaavaadi siddhant kaa pratipaadan wiliam godwin ne kiya jiske anusaar sarkaar or nijee sampatti ve do buraaiyaan hai jo maanav jati kii prakritik purnataa kii prapti main baadhak hai
 Government is a form of autocracy as a means of subordinating others and cruel property is a cruel injustice
 parantu godwin ne sabhi sampatti ko nahin, keval usee sampatti ko bura bataaya jo shoshan main sahaayak hoti he
 He rejected violent revolutionary means to establish an ideal social organization
 nyaay ke adarsh ke prachaar se hi vyakti main vah chetana laai ja sakati he jisase vah choti sthaneey ikaayiyon kii adarsh araajaktaavaadi prasanvidatmak vyavastha sthapit karne main sahyog de sake
 Subsequently two ideologies contributed to the development of anarchist theory in particular
 ek thi charam vyaktvaad kii vichaardhaara, jiskaa pratinidhitiv herbert spencer karte hai
 According to these thinkers, there is opposition to freedom and power and the state is not only inauspicious but also unnecessary
 kintu ye vichaarak nishchit rup se nijee sampatti ke unmoolan ke paksh main nahin the or na sangathit dharm ke hi viruddh the
 The second ideology was related to the philosophy of Fuerbach, which opposed organized religion and the ecological basis of the state
 fuarabaakh ke krantikari vichaaron ke anukool maiks starnar ne samaaj ko keval ek marichika bataaya tathaa dridhtaa se kaha ki manushya kaa apana vyaktitv hi ek aisi vaastaviktaa he jise janaa ja saktaa he
 All the rules that place limits on individuality are a hindrance to the healthy development of ego
 rajya ke sthaan par "ahanvaadiyon kaa sangh" ho to adarsh vyavastha main aarthik shoshan kaa unmoolan ho jayega, kyonki samaaj kaa pramukh utpaadan swatantra sahyog kaa pratifal hoga
 Regarding the revolution, he was of the view that a state dependent on violence can be eradicated only by violence
 araajaktaavaad ko jaagruk jan andolan banane kaa shrey prudhon ko he
 He opposed the monopoly of property and its unfair ownership
 adarsh saamaajik sanghathan vah he jo "vyavastha main swatantraaa tathaa ekta main swadhinata" pradaan kare
 To achieve this goal two fundamental revolutions are necessary: one should be conducted against the present economic system and the other should be against the present state
 parantu kisi bhi sthiti main kranti hinsaatmak na ho, varan vyakti kii aarthik swatantraaa tathaa uske naitik vikaas par jor diya jaae
 Ultimately, the Prudhs accepted that the state could not be completely abolished, so the main objective of anarchism should be to decentralize the functions of the state and reduce it as far as possible by independent collective life
 bakunin ne aadhunik araajaktaavaad main keval kuch nai pravritiyaan hi nahin jodin, varan use samashtivaadee swaroop bhi pradaan kiya
 He emphasized the collective ownership of land and other means of production, as well as private ownership of the goods consumed
 uske vichaar ke teen muladhar hai : araajaktaavaad, anishvarwad tathaa swatantra virgon ke bich swechha par aadhaarit sahyogita kaa siddhant
 As a result, he is opposed to state, church and personal property, these three institutions
 uske anusaar vartmaan samaaj do virgon main vibhajit he : sampann varg jiske haath main rajasatta rahati he, tathaa vipaz varg jo bhoomi, puunji or shiksha se vanchit rahakar pehle varg kii nirankushta ke adheen rahata he, isliye swatantraaa se bhi vanchit rahata he
 Achieving independence is mandatory for everyone in the society
 iske liye dusron ko adheen rakhanevaali har prakaar kii satta kaa bahishkaar karnaa hoga
 God and the kingdom are two such entities
 ek parloukik jagat main tathaa duusari loukik jagat main ucchtam satta ke siddhant par aadhaarit he
 The Church is the liturgy of the first doctrine
 isliye rajyavirohi kranti charchvirohi bhi ho
 Also, the state is always a source of private property, so this revolution should also be against private property
 kranti ke sambandh main bakunin ne hinsaatmak sadhano par apana vishwaas prakat kiya
 The main purpose of the revolution is stated to be the destruction of these three institutions, but nothing was said about the creation of a new society
 manushya kii sahyogita kii pravriti main aseem vishwaas hone ke kaaran bakunin kaa yah vichaar tha ki maanav samaaj ishwar ke andhvishwaas, rajya ke bhrashtachar tathaa nijee sampatti ke shoshan se mukt hokar apana swasth sanghathan swayan kar legaa
 In relation to the revolution, he thought that he should be a byproduct of the ordinary actions of the masses
 saath hi, hinsa par atyadhik bal dekar usne araajaktaavaad main aatankwaadi siddhant joda
 Anarchism has adopted a more and more communist form in the second half of the last century
 is andolan ke netaa kropatkin ne purna samyawad par bal diya
 But at the same time, he rejected the ruling communism as invalid, saying that the state was annihilated by the revolution
 kranti ke liye usne bhi hinsaatmak sadhano kaa prayog uchit bataaya
 There will be no political organization in an ideal society, there will be control of public opinion on the actions of the individual and society
 janamat aabaadi kii choti-choti ikaayiyon main prabhavotpadak hota he, isliye adarsh samaaj graamon kaa samaaj hoga
 There will be no need for an accused organization because such a society will be completely in accordance with moral legislation
 hinsa par ashrith rajya ko sanstha ke sthaan par adarsh samaaj ke aadhaar aichhik sangh or samudaay honge or unka sanghathan neeche se viksit hoga
 At the bottom would be communities of independent individuals, communes, union provinces of communes and union nations of the province
 rashtron ke sangh europea sanyukt raashtra kii or antat: vishwa sanyukt raashtra kii sthapana hogi

 sanyukt rajya america ke sangheey sarkaar kii dwisadani vidhayika ko amareeki congress kehete hai
 The Senate and the House of Representatives have two Houses
 amareeki congress kii baithken uese kii rajdhani washington disi main hotin hai
 'congress' is a Latin word meaning "to come together"
 congress shabd kaa prayog pehali baar 17veen shatabdi main kiya gaya tha
 When the emperor of a country or his fully empowered archangel joins with determination to solve a serious international problem, such a meeting is called Congress
 vidwaanon kii mandali ko bhi congress kaha ja saktaa he
 The term congress is used for the United States federal and federal assembly meetings
 sanyukt rajya america kaa samvidhan, sangheey samvidhan he
 This constitution recognizes the principle of power balance and division of power
 samvidhan nirmaataaon ne sanyukt rajya america kii vidhinirmaan kii satta ko ek congress ke adheen rakhaa he, jiske sinet or house ov riprexantatives naam se do sadan hai
 There has been a lot of disagreement in the national convention
 ant main samvidhan nirmaataaon ne apni vyaavhaarik kushalta kaa parichay dete hue yah nirnay kiya ki house ov riprexantatives kaa sanghathan rashtriya aadhaar par kiya jaae tathaa sinet ko sanghangon kii swatantra astitv kii bhaavana ko banaae rakhane kii drushti se sangathit kiya jaae
 Therefore, Congress is the combined form of Senate and House of Representatives
 samvidhan nirmaataaon ne sinet ke sanghathan main sanghangon kii swatantraaa kii bhaavana ko evam house ov riprexantatives ke sanghathan main rashtriya ekta kii bhaavana ko yathayogy sthaan diya he
 Thus, there is a beautiful coordination of anti-sentiment in the Congress organization
 sanyukt rajya america ne sangheey vidhanmandal kaa naam congress isliye rakhaa ki yah shabd sanghatmak sarkaar kaa parichaayak he
 It is true that in general there is very little change in the organization and rights of the Congress
 samvidhan nirmaataaon ne congress ke sanghathan evam adhikaron ke sambandh main jo kalpana kii thi, uskaa purna abhas vartmaan congress main he
 The representatives of the Senate and House of Representatives will be elected by direct election by the public
 sanyukt rajya america ke 21 varsh se adhik vay ke prayek stri purush ko nirvachan main matdaan kaa adhikaar he
 The qualification of the members of the Senate is: at least 30 years old, nine years old United States citizenship and resident of the state from which he is to be elected
 house ov ripregenttines ke sadasyon ke liye yah yogyata he : kam se kam 25 saal kii vay kaa ho, saat varsh kii sanyukt rajya kii naagarikta ho tathaa us sanghantarit rajya kaa nivasee ho jahaan se uskaa nirvachan honevaala he
 The tenure of the members of the Senate is fixed for six years
 kintu prati duusare varsh ek tihaai sadasyon kaa nayaa nirvachan hota he
 The United States Senate is made up of two representatives from each state who are elected by its public for six years
 house ov riprexantatives sanyukt rajya ke vidhanmandal kaa adhik pratinidhi sadan he
 The number of members of the House of Representatives has been determined according to the population of the federated state, ie a representative is elected behind 3,00,000 persons
 parantu yah bhi shart he ki prayek sanghantarit rajya kaa kam se kam ek pratinidhi avashya nirvaachit ho
 Thus the principle of federalism required equal representation of each federated state
 at: sinet ke sanghathan main is siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he or house ov riprecantives janatantr tathaa sampurna raashtra kii ekta kaa pratik he
 It can generally be said that the rights of national subjects which are not mentioned in the constitution and which are not taboo for Congress, are equally enjoyed by both houses of Congress
 parantu kuch adhikaar aise bhi hai jo uske donon sadanon ko na dekar keval ek hi sadan ko die gaye hai
 Therefore, the rights of the Congress can be studied in three areas: the privileges of the House of Representatives, the privileges of the Senate and the rights of the Congress
 house ov riprexantatives ke visheshadhikaar nimnaankit hai : The privileges of the senate are: congress ke donon sadanon ke varnit visheshadhikaron ke atirikt kuch adhikaar aise hai jo donon sadanon ko samaan rup se praapt hai or donon sadan milakar samvidhan ke antargat inkaa prayog karte hai
 These are mostly the following: congress ke adhikaar aadeshaatmak nahin hai
 The words "congress will be able to legislate on these subjects" have been used in the Constitution
 uparyukt varnan se spasht hi he ki congress keval vidhinirmaan kii sanstha nahin he
 It is the creator of the constitution and it also has some rights related to executive and judiciary
 mote taur se dekhte hue yah gyaat hota he ki donon bhawanon ke adhikaar samaan hai
 Every bill needs to be passed in both the buildings
 prajatantr kii bhaavana ko jaagrit rakhane ke liye yah nitant aavashyak he ki dhan vidheyakon kaa prarambh house ov riprexantatives main ho
 It is a tradition in all the countries that have faith in the democratic system that only the first house should have more authority for the details of money bill and annual income expenditure
 kintu sansar ke anya duusare sadanon kii tulana main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki sanyukt rajya america kaa doosraa sadan bahut shaktishaalee or prabhaavshaalee siddh hua he kyonki ek ore yah apni anumati evam mantranaa ke adhikaar dwaara raashtrapati ko nirankush hone se roktaa he or duusari or house ov riprexantatives ke aveshpurna tathaa kam vivekshil vidheyakon ko rokane main sahaayak hota he

 unhen abhinay bahut pasand nahin tha lekin pita kii asamyik mrityu kii vazah se paison ke liye unhen kuch hindi or marathi filmon main kaam karnaa padaa
 Her first film as an actress was Pahili Mangalagaur, in which she played the younger sister of Snehaprabha Pradhan
 baad main unhone kai filmon main abhinay kiya jinamein, maajhe bal, chimukala sansar, gajabhaau, badi maan, jivan yatra, maand, chhatrapati shivaji shaamil thi
 Lata starred opposite Noor Jahan in Badi Maa, and Asha Bhoslene as her younger sister
 unhone khud kii bhoomika ke liye gane bhi gaaye or aashaa ke liye parshvagayan kiya
 In 1945, Ustad Ghulam Haider took Lata to a producer's studio for his upcoming film, in which Kamini Kaushal was playing the lead role
 ve chaahate the ki lata us film ke liye parshvagayan kare
 But Ghulam Haider felt disappointed
 1947 main vasant joglekar ne apni film aapaki seva main main lata ko gane kaa mauka diya
 Lata had a lot of discussion with the songs of this film
 iske baad lata ne majboor film ke gaanon "angreji chhora chalaa gaya" or "dil meraa todaa hai mujhe kahin kaa na choda tere pyaar ne" jaise gaanon se apni sthiti sudruth kii
 However, Lata was still looking for that particular hit
 1949 main lata ko aisa mauka film "mahal" ke "aayegaa aanevaala" geet se mila
 The song was filmed on Madhubala, the most beautiful and popular actress of the time
 yah film atyant safal rahi thi or lata tathaa madhubala donon ke liye bahut shubh sabit hui
 After this Lata never looked back
 1576 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1576 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 1576 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 likene nimna shrenee kii aisi choti vanaspatiyon kaa ek samooh he, jo vibhinn prakaar ke aadhaaron par uge hue paae jate hai
 The leaves and bark of trees, ancient walls, ground, rocks and rocks are the main ones in these grounds
 yadhyapi ye adhiktar dhaval rang ke hote hai, tathaapi laal, naarangi, bangnee, nile evam bhure tathaa anya chittkarshak rangon ke likene bhi paae jate hai
 Their growth is slow and there is a considerable variation in their size and shape
 in paudhon kaa vanaspatik sharir ek thelas hota he, jo purnataya jad, pattee or shakharahit heta he
 The community of lichens can be mainly divided into three types of bags: kuch chapata or uthaa hua; Like the leaf, in which both the upper and the inner surface are clear enough and dhwaja kii bhanti, jo urdhwadhar disha main vyavasthit hota he
 These three types of classes are called Perpetual, Pernil, and Xupil lichen respectively
 parptimay likene chapate or patale hote hai tathaa vriksh kii chaal, yaa shilaon se chipke hue ugte hai
 Most of them have some part inside the base and they look like brown stripes and dots on the base
 inaki vibhinn jatiyaan aadhaar ke rang se milti hai, at: ye chattan ke samaan hi dikhaai detii he
 Pernyl lichen are like twisted leaves, which have mounts
 ye patale patale mulabhaason kii sahaayta se shilaon, yaa shakhaon se chipke rahete hai
 Radixes originate from their lower surface
 kshupil likene atyadhik vibhajit belanaakaar tathaa feete kii bhanti hote hai, jo apane ad: str se aadhaarik bhaag dwaara dhwaja kii bhanti jude hote hai
 All lichens are adipose, not parasitic
 ye apane parposhi par keval sahare ke liye hi ashrith hote hai
 In fact lichen is a duplex plant composed of two completely different flora
 in vanaspatiyon main se ek he shaiwal or doosraa he kavak, kintu in donon main itnaa nikatatam saahchary hota he ki inase bana likene ek hi paudha prathit hota he
 This association mostly consists of fungi, which cover like a bag over the algae organ and is responsible for the shape of the thallus
 donon vanaspatiyon kii mishrit vruddhi se hi likene ko ek vishesh aakaar or aantar sanrachana praapt hoti he, jisase likene kai kul or jatiyon main vibhakt ho jate hai
 About 400 descendants and 15,000 species are known
 likene kaa mukhya bhaag kavak tantuon se hi nirmit hota he, jo reshon kii ek jaali sa bana hota he
 This lattice is often the botanical part of the fungi of Ascomycetes class
 kuch main kavak basidiomicitis varg kaa bhi hota he
 The upper layer of lichen consists of chlorophyceae, or blue-green vegetation, mixed with these fungal fibers, belongs to the mixophysi class
 yah nile, yaa hare rang kii vanaspati eckoshik tathaa bahukoshik tantuvat hoti he
 These flora contain croococcus, cytonema or nostock etc
 kavak ke bhaag or swaroop ke anusaar likene ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : Ascolycanese - The fungal part of this is the unit of the class of Ascomycetes
 basidiolaikenez - isamen kavak bhaag basidiomicitis varg kaa ekak hota he
 Ascolycane can then be divided into two parts on the same plaque designation: the palindromy, which contains the perithecium and the pectoralis, the resulting portion of which is the pectoral apothecium
 adhikansh parnil likene kii aantarik sanrachana nimnlikhit chaar utakon main vibhakt hoti he : Vulcuts, which are often made of vertical armor formulas that do not have spaces in between, or if they are, are filled with synovial material
 shaiwal str thik valkut ke neeche hota he
 In this, green cells of algae are found in entangled fungal formulas
 is str ko kanistar bhi kehete hai
 The medulla is below the algae layer and is made up of loose and entangled fungal formulas
 ad: valkut, ghaney kavak sutron se nirmit hota he or yah sabase neeche kaa str hota he
 Radixes are produced from the lower surface of the sub-vulcanum
 ye thelas ko aadhaar se jodne kaa kaam dete hai tathaa khanij lavan or jal kaa sanvaahan karte hai
 The fulvous lichen does not have a semi-vulcanus, and most of the saccule lichen sacs have an outcrop, with the algae level below it and a median axis below it
 likene ke bheetar nihit shaiwal adhikanshat: bahari ugnevaale shaiwalon se abhinn hote hai
 Their cells contain green color, with the help of which they make food, but as long as the algae are part of the lichen, they do not form the reproduction
 kavak koshikaon main bhi vruddhi kii gati kam hoti he
 These fungi become unfit for independent living
 likene vishwa bhar main faile hue hai
 Most of these are able to survive even in extreme extremes of temperature and long-term, so they are found abundantly in areas where other vegetation cannot grow
 ye samudri tal se adhik oonchaai par ushn pradesh, dhruv pradesh, registan evam jal sthanon par paae jate hai
 Rarely lichen are found under water, of which the algae called Hydrotheria venosa is the most bizarre
 adhik thandi jalwaayu main likene shailarohi ban jate hai, arthath apana jivan chattaanon, yaa shilaon par vyateet karte hai
 But in the equatorial regions, they remain vulcanic, that is, they have bark of tree trunk and branches
 kuch likene sthalarohi or kuch samudr main bhi hote hai
 Small communities are found in their large classes, whose division depends on the nature of the bark, the nature of the soil, the characteristics of the rock and the temperature, humidity and exposure
 kuch likene upjau bhoomi par ugte hai, jahaan anya vanaspatiyaan bhi prachur maatra main hoti hai
 But they never grow near big cities, because the smoke of factories and other gases etc
 around cities are fatal for them
 ye vaayu kii swatchta par vishesh nirbhar karte hai
 Only in clean air can there be a significant increase of lichen
 yadhyapi likene ke ugane ke liye prakaash aavashyak he, tathaapi kuch jatiyaan aise sthanon main bhi ug sakati hai jahaan purnataya andhkaar hota he, jaise phisia bscura 
 The color of the thallus depends on the intensity of the light rays
 likene ke thelas ke sookhne par shaiwal koshikaon kaa haraa rang kavak sutron se chhipe rahane ke kaaran aspasht ho jaataa he
 The color of humid lichen is green, because the light is transmitted by the fibers inside it, making the green color of the algae clear
 kai laikenon kaa rang vishesh chittkarshak hota he
 These colors are due to various organic acids, which help to hang the lichens but at the same time make them unattractive to eat
 jab sarvapratham likene kii vanavat or sanrachana kii khoj kii gai tab in shaiwal koshikaon kii upasthiti ek paheli thi, kyonki ye shesh thelas se bahut bhinn thim
 Some students of lichen, considering these green objects as an integral part of lichen plant, have expressed the idea that they originated from colorless fungal fibers
 kuch visheshgyon ne inhen prajnan kaa ang mana he tathaa kuch ne inhen bhojan banane ke angon ke rup main sweekaar kiya he
 Schwedner first presented evidence that this green vegetation is algae that have been stained and parasitized by fungal fibers
 is siddhant kii pariksha upyukt shaiwal tathaa kavak ko milakar likene kaa sanshleshan hone par kii gai
 If both parts of the lichen are separated, the algae organ can live independently, but the fungal organ cannot survive when depopulated
 jab yah purnataya siddh kar liya gaya ki likene kaa sharir do vanaspatiyon se bana he, jo kramash: shaiwal or kavak hai, tab likene ke visheshgyon kaa dhyaan in donon bhaagon ke sabandh kii ore aakarshith hua jiske liye vidwaanon ne alag alag naam or vyoraa diya he
 Some compare lichen to a facultative, in which an algae is related to a fungus
 is prakaar ke sambandh se donon ko hi paraspar laabh pahunchataa he tathaa is prakaar ke jivan ko sahjinan kehete hai
 In this, each part performs some physical works that can benefit the other
 shaiwal ang apane hare rang ke padaarthon kii upasthiti se bhojan banane kaa sampurna kaary karata he
 The fungus is completely incapable of doing this task and the fungus also receives food that is made by the algae organ
 duusari ore kavak bhaag ke mulabhas, khanij lavan or jal pravaahit karne ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai tathaa kavak hi shaiwal bhaag kii adhik shushkta, nami, thand or taap se raksha bhi karte hai
 According to the views of some botanists, it is harmful for one, despite having a mutual benefit relationship
 kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar yah parjivita kaa udhaaharan he, jisamen shaiwal bhaag kavak ke dwaara peedit hota he
 Any isolated portion of lichen can grow freely in the proper environment
 kuch likene janan ke liye ek vishesh prakaar ke ang banaate hai, jinhen psoridia kehete hai
 These are small segments of the thallus, in which one or two algae cells are covered by fungal fibers
 yah paitruk thailason se tuutane ke pashchaat vaayu, varsha yaa jantuon dwaara uchit vaataavaran main pahunchakar naveen paudhe banaate hai
 Both components of their lichen have a balanced growth of algae and fungi
 kuch laikenon main shakhaon kii bhanti udvardh vriddhiyaan hoti hai, jinamein shaiwal tathaa kavak donon hi ke ansh hote hai
 These growths dissociate easily and give rise to new plants in the proper environment
 likene ke sanvardhan ke atirikt sanghatak kavak or shaiwal bhi swechhaya pruthak janan karte hai
 In many lichens, fungi regularly form ascocarp and marsupials, which are of the form Perithecium, Apothecium, or other forms
 ye falkaay adhik rangeen or chamkile hote hai
 Cladonia is a group of red forelimbs of ascending branches of Cristatella
 anuroop avasthaa main dhanibijanu ankurit hokar, ek sutara ko janm dete hai or yadi yah sutara kisi aisi shaiwal koshikaon ke sameep aa jaae jinase yah likene se sambandhit tha to ek nae likene thelas kaa sanshleshan ho jaataa he
 If the growing fungus trap does not find favorable algae, it dies
 is kaaran yah sandigdh he ki dhanibijanu likene ke sanvardhan main mahatvapurn kaary karte hai, yaa nahin
 It is possible that denudation and formation of soridum are more useful in lichen generation
 likene prakruti tathaa manushya ke jivan main ek pramukh kaary karte hai
 They are inventors of flora and proper land construction
 kadi or nangi chattaanon par ugnevaali pehali vanaspati parptimay likene he
 With the help of the acids he created, the molten lichen combines the reefs of the rocks with their residuals to form a type of soil, which becomes the breeding ground for the spore of Harita and is then colonized by flora
 likene kii kai jatiyaan chote chote jantuon ke liye bhojya padaarth hai
 Many of these are valuable food items of wild animals
 praaia: inako bhram se rangifer moss kaha jaataa he
 Humans also use them, either due to taste or in case of famine, when no other food items are obtained
 lapland, iceland tathaa anya upottaradhruviya pradeshon ke atirikt bharat, japan evam anya deshon main inako kaaphi maatra main sukhaakar maanav bhojan yaa gaay, bhens, boar tathaa ghodon ke khaane liye ekatra kiya jaataa he
 Xerophora esculenta is considered a delicious food item in China and Japan
 setareria icelandika ek moolyavaan khaadya likene he, jiskaa upyog iceland or scadenevia main kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that the "manna" described in the Bible is a lichen called Lecanora esculenta, which was eaten by castes living in the deserts of Asia Minor
 saadharantaya likene apane amleey or katuswaad ke kaaran maanav bhojan ke liye anupyukt hote hai
 Many species of lichen have been used in ancient times for the treatment of ailments, as they resembled human body parts
 vishwaas tha ki asania jati kaa likene keshvardhan main laabhadaayak hota tha
 Similarly Kukur lichen, Peltigera canina, was considered beneficial in hydrophobia
 anya likene pilia, dast tathaa bukhaaron ke liye prayukt kiye jate the
 In ancient times, when synthetic colors were not manufactured, some species of lichen were the main means of obtaining colors

 orsin in laikenon se praapt rang ko shuddh karne par praapt hota he or sookshmdarsheey nirmitiyon ko rangne ke kaary main prayukt hota he
 Litum color is also obtained from lichen
 kuch laikenon main tannin hota he, jo pashuon kii kachi khaal pakaane main prayukt hota he
 Some species of lichen have a pleasant smell, which is why they are used to make fragrances and soaps
 likene hamaare liye apane aganit gunon ke kaaran bade upyogi hai
 Due to their absence a large part of the earth would undoubtedly become barren and lifeless and there is no banaspati either

 They only had clothes worn on the body
 sashastr aandolan kaise karnaa he, isaki jaankaree kisi ko bhi nahin thi, phir bhi ve apane abhiyaan main safal rahe
 Shri Rajabhau Wakankar, Sudhir Phadke, Baba Saheb Purandare, Vishwanath Narwane, Nana Kajrekar etc

 But these people were proud of their success
 is sangram main do mahilaon kaa bahut bada yogadan tha
 One was Mrs
 Hemavatibai Natekar, who had a seva ashram near Silvassa in the Indian border, who provided all kinds of assistance to Mr
 Wakankar, Mr
 Kajrekar, Mr
 Narwane from the ashram for pre-preparation
 yah sthaan krantikariyon ke liye aashray sthaan tha
 Mrs Natekar had assisted in taking all kinds of threats
 aaj vah nahin he, kintu unka naam anya krantikariyon ke saath ajar-amar ho gaya he
 The other woman whose matchless contribution was in this struggle is Mrs

 In most animals impregnation is essential for reproduction; But there are also some animals in which reproduction takes place without impregnation, this is called parthenic reproduction or asexual reproduction
 kuch machhliyon ko chhodkar kisi bhi prishthvanshi main anishek janan nahin paaya jaataa or na kuch bade bade kitgan, jaise vyadhapatangagan tathaa bhinnapakshanugan main
 There are also some animals in which reproduction takes place exclusively through non-reproductive reproduction, such as in the biogenetic schism, kirotvarga, jalpanishu and druyaka
 shalkipaksha main anishek janan birle hi miltaa he, kintu sunshalbhavansh kii kai ek jatiyon main paaya jaataa he
 In some genealogies of weevils, anorexia is also often found
 prajnan, linganishchayan, tathaa koshikavigyaan kii drushti se kai prakaar ke anishek jananatantr pahachaane ja sakate hai
 In terms of reproduction, the following classification of non-reproductive reproduction can be: isamen asansikt anda kabhi-kabhi viksit ho jaataa he
 Common non-fertile reproduction is of the following types: isamen anda sarvada bina sansechan ke viksit hota he: A
 Absolute reproduction is found in all generations of individuals
 kha
 chakrik anishek janan main ek athwa adhik anishek janit pidiyon ke baad ek dwilling peedi aati rahati he
 In this, the egg develops either by coagulation or by non-reproductive reproduction
 linganishchay ke vichaar se anishek janan teen prakaar ke hote he: A
 Unfettered eggs develop in non-reproductive reproduction and form male animals
 sansikt andey maadaa jantu banate hai
 B
 Eggs that are not soaked in gynecology develop and form female animals
 ga
 ubhayjanan main asansikt andey viksit hokar kuch nar or kuch maadaa banate hai
 In terms of cellularity, there are several types of non-reproductive reproduction: ardhak anishek janan main anishek janan dwaara utpann jantu un andon se viksit hote hai jinamein cendrak sutron kaa hraas hota he or cendrak sutron kii maatra aadhi ho jaati he
 This happens in two ways: tanu anishek janan main anishek janan dwaara utpann jantuon main cendrakasutron kii sankhya dvigun athwa bahugun hoti he
 This happens in two ways: swatassansechak anishek janan main niyamit rup se cendrak sutron kaa yugmanubandh tathaa hraas hota he or cendrak sutron kii sankhya andon main aadhi ho jaati he
 But the quantity of nucleus sources is increased again by the formation or interpolation of the nucleus re-established by the convention of two semiconductors

 unhone binati kerani shuru kii he prabhu! main to aapkaa chota sa sevak hoon, doodh lekar aayaa hoon krupa karke ise grahan kiijie
 The devotee expressed his discomfort in this way - he prabhu! yah doodh main kapalaa gaay se doh kar laayaa hoon
 Oh my gobind! If you drink milk, then my mind will be calm or my father will be angry
 sone kii katori maine aapke aage rakhi he
 PA! Must drink i have not committed any sin

 Dad will get me out of the house
 jo kaary namdev ke pita sari umr na kar sake vah kaary namdev ne kar diya
 That innocent child was not aware of Pandito's dishonesty

 Namdev has mentioned this in this way - ek bhakt prabhu ke hryday main bas gaya
 Lord laughed seeing Namdev
 hans kar unhone donon haath aage badhaaen or doodh pi liya
 After drinking milk, the idol became the same again
 doodh pilaakar namdev ji ghar chale gaye
 In this way the Lord gave them a darshan

 Even today, joint family is considered as a whole family
 In the present times single family is seen as a compulsion
 In our country even today single family is not recognized
 Joint families continue to disintegrate due to industrial development
 is 
 But even today, the importance of joint family has not diminished
 Before discussing the importance of joint family, let us take a look at the reasons for the disintegration of the joint family, and to throw light on the danger looming over its existence
 The reason is the desire to get employment
 Due to the increasing population and decreasing employment, the members of the family move from village to city for their livelihood
 Or does it go from small town to big cities and is required to go abroad in the same episode
 Traditional business or farming fence has its own limitations which are not able to meet all the requirements for the growing family members
 Hence the family has to look for new economic sources
 When new possibilities start coming down in their village or city So the new generation of family has to go elsewhere in search of Rajghar
 Now they have to settle their family where employment is available
 Because it is not possible for every person to be able to regularly go to the original place of his family
 Sometimes he has to go to work hundreds of kilometers away
 Another important reason for the breakdown of the joint family is the ever increasing consumerism
 Has become more ambitious
 Family stamina is being lost due to longing for more facilities, and selfishness TI is going
 Now he finds his happiness not by his happy family or family, but by gathering more happiness resources, and is causing the joint family to disintegrate
 Humans are becoming emotionally disabled while living in single family
 The burden of responsibilities, and unbearable stress has to be endured
 But on the other hand, due to her comfort and increased self-confidence, the path of her future development opens

uske mahatva ko ekal parivaar main rah rahe log adhik achche se samaj pate hai 
unhen sanyukt parivaar ke fayede najar aate hai 
kyonki kisi bhi vastu kaa mahatva uske abhaav ko jhelane vaale adhik samaj sakate hai 
ab sanyukt pariwaron ke laabh par silsile baar charchaa karte hai 
 All family members bear the responsibility of safety of each member of the family
 So any member's health problem, safety problem, financial problem belongs to the whole family
 Any unexpected unexpected problem is easily solved
 As if Even if someone struggles with a serious illness, all the family members help him to get rid of the disease with his help
 Jagars do not hesitate
 No one in the village or locality gets dared to mess with them
 Being organized gives them full protection
 The person remains free from all kinds of stress

atah tanaav mukt ho kar kaary karne main adhik kushi milti he 
uski kaary kshamta adhik hone se kaarobaar adhik unnat hota he 
parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon kii aavashyaktaaon kii poorti apekshaakrit adhik ho sakati he or jivan ullas purna vyateet hota he
 The children in the joint family get the most safe and appropriate physical and character development opportunity
 The child's wishes and needs can be taken care of
 He gets the opportunity to play with other children
 Along with the mother and father Love is also received from relatives, especially grandfathers and grandmothers
 While in a lonely family, sometimes even the love of parents is rarely found, if both work Grandfather
 Grandpa, grandma gets knowledge, experience with love
 It is entertaining to play with her, spending time with her
 She is supported by many family members to make them sanskar, character, and make them strong

 All members in the joint family keep constant watch over each other's conduct, curb someone's undesirable activity
 That is, every member remains characterful
 All families support him during any problem and there is collective pressure
 There is no member who knows how to do anti-social work, due to the fear of the elderly, evades evils like alcohol gambling or any other intoxication

 bhautikee main mukhya rup se teen prakaar kii sankhyikee kaa upyog hota he
 Chirasmat Statistics, bose-einstein and fermi-dirac Statistics
 duusare or tisare prakaar kaa sammilit rup main kwantum sankhyikee bhi kehete hai, kyonki inamen ham kwantum siddhant ke ddhara jatil samudaayon ke gundharmo kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Prior to the invention of quantum statistics, this work was taken from the statistic itself and it also got enough success
 parantu kalantar main prakashavidyut prabhaav nune taap par vishesh ooshmaa, kaali vastu kaa vikiran vishyak kuch aise avishkaar hue jinako chirsantam bhautikee bhalee prakaar se samajha nahi saki

 Einstein originally propagated the principle called bose-einstein Statistics by spreading this rule to the gaseous community
 fermi or dirack ne san 1924 main swatantra rup se fermi -dirack sankhyikee kii neenv, daali, jo pauli ke apvarjan siddhant par aadhaarit thi
 In a community of similar particles it is in principle impossible to differentiate between particles, so the wavelength of the community must be symmetric or asymmetric in the coordinates of any two particles
 isse vinimay kriya jaise bahut se prabhaav hote hai, jo katipay dhaatuon main louh chumbakatch tathaa pratilohachubakatv ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Different particles can be divided into two categories so that the community of similar particles of one type will be according to the bose-einstein-statistic and the behavior of similar particles of the other type will be based on the fermi-dirac-statistic
 ve sab parmanviya nabhik jinaki sanhatisankhya yugma hoti he, bose-oinstin-sankhyikee main sammilit hai ke-mesaan ) aadi, tathaa jinaki sanhatisankhya visham hoti he, ve sab fermi-dirack-sankhyikee ke anusaar vyavhaar karte he 
 The fermi-dirac, bose-einstein and Maxwell statistics have the same behavior in the marginal condition
 akriy samaan kanon ke samudaay ke gun adarsh gas ke gunon se kitne bhinn hote hai, We get this estimate from p = nh3 / g

 If the value of p is less than one, the behavior of the gas is similar to that of an ideal gas
 bose gas ke liye p kaa adhiktam maan 2

 It is related to the Bose -istine compaction process, which occurs at 2

 is param taap se nimna taap par is drav ke kuch gun bade adbhut he, jaise atitaralata 
 He3, which complies with the fermi-dirac-statistic, remains a fluid up to zero ultimate temperature, like He4, and does not make up to 0
08 absolute temperature

 In the fermi-dirac statistic, when p is much larger than one, the gas is said to be completely unrefined

 The electrical and thermal properties of metals can be explained well by this method

 The density of a particular class of stars, called white dwarf stars, is very high

 Till now Bose and Fermi statistics have been used only to study the properties of gases whose particles have no attractive power and whose particle has zero value

 Rageshwari is an actress in Hindi films
 'pramanbhaar' ke do arth hai : There are many subjects, which do not require proof
 anyaanya sambhddha vishyon ko sakshya ke dwaara pramanit karte hai
 The witness's confession, confession and production of appropriate papers are under evidence
 sakshya dene kaa pratham daayitv us paksh par hai, jise maamle ko praathmik rup main pramanit karnaa he
 Each party has its own responsibility of proof
 jis paksh par pramaan dene kaa daayitv rahata he, vah yadi upyukt sakshya prastut na kare to nyaayalay uske viruddh apana nirnay degaa
 In cases of impunity, the charge remains on the prosecutor
 is niyam kaa koi apwaad nahin he
 The law envisages that the accused is innocent until the indictment brought against him is absolutely undoubtedly proven
 at: aise maamalon main pramanbhaar maamla chalaanevaale par rahata he evam abhiyog kaa prayek charan use hi pramanit karnaa hota he, bhale hi use nakaaratmak vishyavastu par hi sakshya kyon na dena pade
 The accused does not have to prove his innocence
 divaani maamalon main pramanbhaar kaa daayitv us paksh par he, jo vivaadaaspad vishay main apane swatv ko upasthit karata he
 This rule is based on the principle that the party who supports the existence of a subject should only give evidence of it, not the opponent who does not accept the existence of the controversial subject
 at: divaani maamaalon main pramanbhaar vaadi par rahata he
 If he bears that obligation and certifies the case as primary, allowing him to have a loan, then in such a situation the onus of giving evidence against his claim rests with the defendant
 sakshya ke dauraan main pramanbhaar kaa daayitv kab vaadi se prativaadee par evam prativaadee se vaadi par chalaa jaayga, kahana kathin he
 It varies according to the evidence given mutually
 kintu antat: pramanbhaar us paksh par rahata he, jo pratipakshi ke sakshya ke uttar main sakshya nahin dene se, maamle main parajeet hoga
 On the basis of the accepted evidence from the case, the court examines the controversial claim and gives its decision in favor of the party who receives the plurality of evidence
 bahudhaa log dusron ke naam se bhoomi athwa anyaanya sampatti kharidte hai
 These are called 'anonymous'
 jo paksh 'benami' ko nyaayalay se amaanya ghoshit karana chahta he, usee par is baat kaa pramanbhaar rahata he ki vastav main kharidaar koi doosraa hi he tathaa jiske naam sampatti kharidi gai he, vah keval naam kaa hi khariddaar he
 In this context, where the amount of the purchase came from, it is especially worth considering
 kisi divaani maamle main yadi koi paksh yah kahe ki uskaa maamla kisi nirdisht deshaachaar kinwa kulachaar par aadhaarit he tathaa desh kaa saadhaaran kanoon uske maamle main lagu nahin hota to use hi ukt deshaachaar athwa kulachaar ko nirvivaad rup se pramanit karnaa hota he
 In defamation cases, the charge remains on the plaintiff
 use hi pehle sakshya dena padataa he ki vah apane viruddh laae gaye laanchhan ke liye doshi nahin he
 Only after giving his evidence, the defendant can give evidence that he had said or written the same in terms of pure spirit and public interest, against which the plaintiff has filed the case
 yadi sarkaar kii ore se yah daawa kiya jaay ki koi vyakti bina uttaradhikari chode mar gaya he, at: uski sampatti 'aschit' ke kanoon ke anusaar sarkaar kii he to sarkaar par is baat kaa pramanbhaar rahegaa ki sampatti kaa antim adhikari bina uttaradhikari chode mara
 If someone gives money to someone on a forged check, then there will be a charge on the bank that there was no inadvertence on his part in the check
 vidweshpurn maamle ke daawey main vaadi ko hi pramanit karnaa padataa he ki prativaadee ne vidwesh se evam yuktisangat kaaran kaa abhaav rahete hue vaadi par dandabhiyog kaa maamla chalaaya tha
 If a woman's husband says that his woman was in a rascal with another man, then he has to prove the misdeeds of the woman
 hindu vidhaan main kanoon kii aisi koi kalpana nahin he ki sanyukt parivaar hone se hi parivaar ke sadasyon kii sampati sanyukt he
 But if it is accepted or certified that a Hindu family is joint and the property of the joint family is subject to it, then the law is envisaged in that order if the member under different members of the joint family claims the said property in person
 If they do, they will have to give proof that the property is their own, not the joint family
 yadi kisi dastavej kaa nishpaadan pramanit ho, kintu yah kaha jaay ki jis samay dastavej likhaa ja rahaa tha, us samay dastavej banaanevaale veikshipt tha, to mastishk kii veikshipta kaa pramanbhaar dastavej banaanevaale par he
 If the person was deranged before the execution of the document, but it should be said that he was in mental equilibrium at the time of making the document, then the proof of the same would remain on him
 yadi kisi dastavej ke nishpaadan ko pramanit maan liya jaay, kintu usame varnit vishay ko asaty evam nakli kah kar aisa akshep kiya jaay ki uske anusaar kaary karne kaa uddeshy nahin tha, to ukt akshepkaaree par is kathan kaa pramanbhaar rahegaa
 If any document registered or not accepted is accepted in the case, then the proof that there was no consideration in it is on the creator of the document
 divaani maamalon main pramanbhaar ke prasang main lagu ukt saadhaaran kanoon ke do vikalp he : In the appeal of the prosecution, the charge generally rests on the prosecutor
 nyaayalay ko yah dekhnaa hota he ki abhiyukt ko diya gaya dand thik he yaa nahin
 If there is an appeal against a decision where the accused has been freed, the liability of the prosecutor is even greater on the person conducting the case
 divaani apil main pramanbhaar apil karanevaale par he
 He only has to prove that the decision given under appeal is wrong

 If any is the most popular ingredient in daily North Indian subcontinental breakfast, it is parantha
 ise banane kii jitani vidhiyaan hai vaise hi hindi main iske kai rup prachlit hai jaise paratha, parautha, paravatha, parantha or paraanwatha
 From north to south and from east to west it is part of the Indian kitchen and the breathtaking aroma of parantha that is baked on the pan every morning increases appetite
 haa swasthya kii drushti se ye avashya vasa se bharpoor hone ke kaaran simit maatra main hi upbhog kiye jane chaiye
 Parantha is made almost like bread, the only difference is its fomentation
 roti ko jahaan tave par senkane ke baad sidhe aanch par bhi phulayaa jaataa he vahiin parantha sirf tave par hi senka jaataa he
 After making the roti, pure ghee can be applied from above, while the paratha is baked by applying ghee or oil at the time of baking it on the pan
 bharwaan parantha banane ke liye aataa yaa maida mel kar uski loi bel kar usamen bharaavan bharen, phir use bel kar tave par senken
 The word paratha is made up of overhead + period
 upari yani upar kaa or aavart yani chaaron or ghumana
 Just consider the method of baking bread or paratha made on a pan
 ise samtap miltaa rahe iske liye ise upar se lagaataar ghuma-phiraa kar senka jaataa he
 Like Phulkas, both the layers of parantha do not flower, but only the upper layer
 iskaa kram kuch yun rahaa upari+aavart > uparawata > paraanwatha > parantha
 By the way, simply the dish of diced flour = layer + flour = paratha = paratha
 bharat paryant or videshon main bhi ye bahut prachlit hai
 Parantha of Kerala is famous in South India
 isko vahaan protta kehete hai
 It has many layers with very smoothness

 Sometimes the word tradition or hadith is used
 sira sahitya main vibhinn visham samagriyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he, jinamein mukhya rup se mohammad or unke saathi dwaara kiye gaye sainya abhiyaanon kii kahaniyaan shaamil hai
 These stories are intended as historical accounts and are used for worship
 sira main kai likhit dastavej bhi shaamil hai, jaise ki raajnneetik sandhi, sainya suchi, adhikariyon ke kaary, videshi shaskaon ko patr, or aage bhi
 It also records some speeches and sermons made by Muhammad, like his speech in the Farwell pilgrimage
 kuch sira khaaton main kavita ke chand shaamil hai jo kuch ghatnaon or ladaai kaa jashn manaate hai
 While some of these are considered to be of low quality and lack of authenticity, the most serious of them are by Hasan ibn Thabit
 baad kii avadhi main, sira main shaamil kuch prakaar kii kahaniyaan apane swayan ke alag-alag shaileyon main viksit huin
 One genre is concerned with stories of prophetic miracles, known as alum al-nubuwa 
 ek anya style, jise flyal vaa mathlib kaha jaataa he - kahaniyaan jo vyaktigat saathi, dushmano or mohammad ke anya ullekhneey samakaleen logon kii yogyata or dosha dikhaati hai
 Some of Sira's works also put the story of Muhammad as part of a narrative that included stories of former prophets, Persian kings, pre-islamic Arab tribes, and Rashidun
 quran main varnit ghatnaon se sira ke kuch hisson ko prerit kiya gaya tha, yaa vistrut kiya gaya tha
 These parts were often used by the authors of Tafsir and Essb al-nuzul to provide background information for the events mentioned in some sections
 haddees or aitihaasik report ke bich mukhya antar yah he ki ek haddees is tarah kii ghatana se chintit nahin he, or aamtaur par samay yaa sthaan nirdisht nahin karata he
 Rather the aim of the hadith is to record a religious doctrine as the official source of Islamic law
 iske vipareet, jabaki ek kabar main kuch kanoonee yaa dharmik prabhaav ho sakate hai, iskaa mukhya uddeshy kisi nishchit ghatana ke bare main jaankaree dena he
 In terms of structure, Hadith and Khabar are very similar
 donon main isanad shaamil hai
 Thus beginning in the 8th and 9th centuries, many scholars have devoted similar efforts to both types of texts
 iske alaava kuch itihaaskaar sira or magahaaji sahitya ko haddees kaa up-samooh maanate hai
 During the early centuries of Islam, Siyara literature was taken less seriously than hadith
 umayyaad kaal main, kahanikar nijee sabhaaon or masjidon main mohammad or pehle ke bhavishyavaktaaon kii kahaniyon ko bataane ke liye istemaal karte the, kyonki unhen adhikariyon se anumati praapt hoti thi
 Many of these storytellers are now unknown
 umayyaad kaal ke baad, unki pratishtha atiranjit or kalpana karne ke icchhuk hone or israeliat par bharosa karne ke kaaran unki pratishtha bighad gai
 Thus they were banned from preaching in mosques
 baad kii avadhi main, haalanki, sira ke kaam adhik pramukh ban gaye
 Recently, Western historical criticism and the debate concerning Sira has gained a defensive attitude from some Muslims who wrote apologetic literature defending their material
 sadiyon se, muslim vidwaanon ne haddees kii pramanikta kii samasya ko pahachaanaa he
 They have thus developed sophisticated methods of evaluating isnadas
 yah prayek haddees ko "dhwani" main pramanik report ke liye vargeekrut karne ke liye kiya gaya tha, kyonki anya shreniyon ke alaava, shaayad kamjor logon ke liye "kamjor" ke vipareet
 Since many Sira reports also include information on the Isnad and some Sira compilers themselves were practicing jurists and hadith transmitters, it was possible to apply the same methods of hadith criticism to Sira reports
 haalanki, kuch sira report isnaad ke ek aparichit rup kaa upyog karke likhi gai thim, yaa aadhunik itihaaskaaron ne "samuhik isnaad" yaa "sanyukt report" ko kya kaha tha
 The use of collective isnad was that a report could be related to one person over another person's authority without distinguishing the words of one person
 parishuddhta kii is kami ne kuch haddees vidwaanon ko aisi koi report lene kaa netritv kiya jo pramanikta kii kami ke liye ek samuhik isnaad kaa upyog karata tha
 According to Wim Raven, it is often noted that a coherent image of Muhammad cannot be constructed from the literature of Syrah, whose authenticity and factual value have been questioned on many different grounds
 vah sira kii pramanikta ke khilaaf nimnlikhit tarkon ko soochibaddh karata he, yahaan die gaye tarkon kaa paalan karke: Nevertheless, other contents of Sira, like the constitution of Medina, are generally considered authentic
 nimnlikhit praarambhik haddees colectoron main se kuch kii suchi he jo sira or magahaaji report ekatra karne or sankalit karne main vishisht hai: Gandhi Smriti is a museum in New Delhi, India which is dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi

 pradooshak paryaavaran ko or jeev-jantuon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Pollution means - 'contamination of air, water, soil, etc
 with unwanted liquids', which has a direct adverse effect on living organisms and other indirect effects by damage to ecosystems
 vartmaan samay main paryaavarniya avanayan kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran he
 It was first noted in the year of 1980 that the dissolution of the ozone level is happening all over the earth
 dakshin dhruv vistaaron main ozon str kaa vighatan 40%-50% hua he
 This massive phenomenon is called ozone hole
 maanav awaas vaale vistaaron main bhi ozon chhidron ke failane kii sambhaavna ho sakati he
 But it is based on the climatic condition of gases and the existence of impurities floating in the atmosphere
 ozon str ke ghatane ke kaaran dhruviya pradeshon par jamaa barf pighalane lagi he tathaa maanav ko anek prakaar ke charm rogon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This is a problem arising from the use of Freon and Chlorofluorocarbon gas in refrigerators and air conditioners
 aaj hamaara vaataavaran dooshit ho gaya he
 Air is polluted due to gases emanating from vehicles and factories
 milon se nikalne vaale kachare ko nadiyon main choda jaataa he, jisase jal pradooshan hota he
 Land pollution is caused by people throwing garbage
 vaayu pradooshan arthath hawa main aise avaanchit gaison, dhul ke kanon aadi kii upasthiti, jo logon tathaa prakruti donon ke liye khatre kaa kaaran ban jaae
 In other words, pollution means being contaminated or dirty
 vaayu kaa avaanchit rup se ganda hona arthath vaayu pradooshan he
 Some common causes of air pollution are: vaayu pradooshan hamaare vaataavaran tathaa hamaare upar anek prabhaav daalata he
 Some of them are as follows 2
 vaayu pradooshan se sardiyon main koharaa chaaya rahata he, jiskaa kaaran dhuen tathaa mitti ke kanon kaa kohre main mila hona he
 This reduces natural visibility and causes eye irritation and difficulty in breathing
 3
 ozon parat, hamaari prithvi ke chaaron ore ek surakshatmak gas kii parat he
 Which protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun
 vaayu pradooshan ke kaaran jin aparivartan, anuvashankeey tathaa twachaa cancer ke khatre bad jate hai
 4
 Earth's temperature increases due to air pollution, because the heat coming from the sun does not reduce the effect of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the environment, which are harmful
 5
 vaayu pradooshan se amleey varsha ke khatre bade hai, kyonki barish ke pani main sulfur daai oxide, nitrogen oxide aadi jaisi jahrili gaison ke ghulne kii sambhaavna badi he
 This can cause damage to crops, trees, buildings and historic buildings
 6
 dhwani kii adhikta ke kaaran bhi pradooshan hota he, jise ham dhwani pradooshan ke rup main jaanate hai
 Noise pollution simply means unwanted sound that makes us feel irritable
 iskaa kaaran he- rail ingine, hawaii jahaaj, janarator, telephone, televijan, vaahan, laudspikar aadi aadhunik mashine
 Weakening of hearing power, headache, irritability, hypertension or neurological, psychological defects are caused by prolonged noise pollution
 lambey samay tak dhwani pradooshan ke prabhaav se swaabhaavik pareshaaniyaan bad jaati he
 Water pollution means the contamination of water due to the presence of unwanted and noxious elements in the water, so that it is not potable
 jal pradooshan ke vibhinn kaaran nimnlikhit haih Water pollution has the following effects: bhoomi pradooshan se abhipraay jameen par jahrile, avaanchit or anupayogi padaarthon ke bhoomi main visarjeet karne se he, kyonki isse bhoomi kaa nimnikaran hota he tathaa mitti kii gunvattta prabhavit hoti he
 Due to irresponsibility of people the earth is getting polluted
 bhoomi pradooshan ke mukhya kaaran hai : Land pollution has the following harmful effects: iskaa arth he ki vyavsaayik ikaiyaan aisa koi bhi kadam na uthaae, jisase paryaavaran ko or adhik haani ho
 For this it is necessary that the business complies with all the pollution control regulations implemented by the government
 manushyon dwaara kiye ja rahe paryaavaran pradooshan ke niyantran ke liye vyavsaayik ikaiyon ko aage aana chahie
 This means that commercial units help to modify or improve the damage to the environment
 saath hi yadi pradooshan ko niyantrit karnaa sambhav na ho to uske nivaaran ke liye upachaaratmak kadam uthaa lene chahie
 For example plantation; The afforestation program can reduce air pollution in the surroundings of industrial units
 vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra This means make people aware of the causes and consequences of environmental pollution, so that they can voluntarily protect the environment instead of harming the environment
 udhaaharan ke liye vyavsaay jaagrukta kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kare
 Nowadays some business units are taking up the responsibilities of developing and maintaining parks in cities, which shows that they are environmentally conscious
 pradushan ek pramukh paryaavarniya mudda ban gaya he kyoki yah har aayu varg ke logon or jaanwaron ke liye swasthya kaa khatra he
 In recent years, the rate of pollution has been increasing rapidly as industrial waste materials are directly mixed in soil, air and water
 haalanki hamaare desh main ise niyantrit karne ke liye puraa dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 This needs to be dealt with seriously otherwise our future generations will suffer a lot
