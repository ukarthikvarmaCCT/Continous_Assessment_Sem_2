 The language in which the work of the nation should be done
 raashtra ke kaam-dham yaa sarkari kaamkaaj ke liye sweekrut bhashaa
 The matter of the national language, which has become very entangled in this country and writing or talking on it, is being considered the work of mediocre campaigners
 aaj apni bhashaa main likhane par bhi log bhashaa par baat karnaa avaanchit samajhate hai
 The question of language is human, especially in India, where imperialist language is separating the masses from democracy
 hindi or angreji kii sparddha deshi bhashaaon or rashtrabhasha ke dwandv main badal gai he, manon ko jodne vaala sutara talwaar qaraar de diya gaya he, paradheenata kii bhashaa swadhinata kaa garv ho gai he
 Surely there is activism of the slave mind behind it
 kaisaa ajab lagata he, jab koi isliye andolan kare ki hamen daastaa do, bediyaan pahanaao ! Our thinking and attitude about language is what life is about
 koi bhi mulya nasht hone se bachaa he ki bhashaa or swabhimaan bache rahen ? mujhe lagata he ki ab raajnneeti, naukarshahi, poonjeewaad yaa samrajyavad ko kosna bekaar he; jab tak janata khud hi apana hit-anhith na dekhegi, tab tak kuch nahin badalegaa
 So any problem, it should be directly addressed or addressed to the public
 logon ko vibhaajankaree shadyantron ke hawaale karke ham bhashaa ke bheetar koi samvedan, koi hardikta paidaa nahin kar rahe hai
 If non-hindi speakers are mistakenly thinking that Hindi will not be good, then it will be good for them, then they will have to talk to them that English will come, then the character of English as the official language teaches to hate the native language and the public
 hindi kii koi sparddha deshi bhashaaon se nahin he
 She wants to see them flourish, wants to do spirituality with them
 rashtrabhasha hindi ke bare main kuch kehane main jhijak hoti he, kyonki saubhaahgya yaa durbhaagya se ham hindibhashi hai, jabaki yah hona hamane nahin chunaa he

 rashtrabhasha ke rup main isaki aavashyaktaa sabase pehle ahindibhashiyon ne hi anubhav kii
 Hindi speakers have added voice to their voice, so that they are not considered incompetent
 phir bhi vidambnaa yah he ki unheen par hindi thopane yaa hindi kaa samrajyavaad sthapit karne kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Who imposed this Hindi on us? Our Hindi is brought up in the lap of saints and devotees, till date it has never been in love with power

 Hindi has never received royalty like Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian or English
 tamgaa banane kii uski ichha rahi hi nahin, alabatta vah desh kii baansuri, talwaar or dhaal jarur bani he
 Whenever the country needed to be united in a formula, whenever there was a need to declare its rebellion, Hindi has done it before
 tabhi raja rammohan raay ke pehle samachar-patr kii vah bhashaa bani
 He brought the voice of Gandhi's united India to the masses
 africa se lautne par jab gandhi ji ne pehla bhaashan hindi main diya tha or kuch logon ne aapatti kii thi to unhone kaha tha ki main hindi main nahin, bharat kii bhashaa main bol rahaa hoon
 Subhash Chandra Bose's challenge in Hindi was echoed in ten directions
 sambhawatah inhen sevaaon ko yaad karke swatantra bharat ke samvidhan main hindi ko rashtrabhasha or rajbhasha kaa sammaan diya gaya
 In this way only its imperative was underlined for the dialogue and unity of the Indian public
 kya desh ko aaj ekaatmata or samvaad kii jarurat nahin rah gai he ? Independence is a continuous tenacity, not a restlessness and a full stop
 jis din is tathy ko koi desh bhul jaataa he, vahi uske vighatan kaa pehla din hota he
 At the same time, the country loses its identity and denies its existence
 aaj ham vighatan ke usee charam daur se guzar rahe hai
 On the pretext of rejecting the national language, we are inadvertently going to cancel all the native languages
 yah kisi bhayaavah sankat kii purv soochna he
 In the last days, ie in the latter half of the nineteenth century, three accidents occurred simultaneously in India at a rapid pace — fierce provincialism, communal hysteria and the full prestige of the English
 ye baaten akaaran ek saath paidaa nahin huin-inkaa ek-duusare se naabhi naal sambandh he-ye sabhi raashtra kii asmita ko khandit karne or use phir se pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh paradheenata ke andhe kuen main dhakelne vaali ghatnaayen hai
 In all three cases, the disintegration of foreign powers along with the foreign powers is not unreasonable
 sabase pehle aapse apni bhashaa chhini ja rahi he, taaki aap kisi bhi maamle main paraspar athmiya samvaad kaayam na kar saken, jaise aakraman senaayen pulon ko uda detii hai
 a dumb and speechless country can only break its forehead
 aapako apni bhashaa ke badale jo paradeshi bhashaa di gai he vah jodne vaali nahin he, kyonki vah bharat kii janata ko paraspar jodne ke liye laai bhi nahin gai thi
 The British had no other way of making slaves more enslaved
 is satya ko na samajhate hue aaj bhi kuch log tark dete hai ki angreji shiksha paae hue kuch logon ne hi swadhinata or saamaajik sudhaaron ke liye sangharsh kiya tha
 That is, English education created the desire for independence in them; United them for freedom
 yah sunakar lagata he ki ye log itihaas kii krurta ko chunauti dene vaale itihaas se aparichit hai
 In a state of no avail, the rebel forces always weaponize the means obtained, such as a stone, stick, or nail to be gunned down to deal with an enemy present
 japaniyon, chiniyon yahudiyon yahan tak ki khud angrejon ne bhi apane-apane paradheen kaal main vijetaon kii bhashaayen shastron kii tarah istemaal kii thim, jinhen swadhinata ke baad sabane phenk diya
 Even today, African Negroes are writing literature against the whites in English, but its intense pain is reflected in their literature
 isiilie ve apni boliyon ke jariye swayan apni bhashaa gadhane main vyast hai
 From this point of view, taking any mandatory historical ad-hoc as evidence is simplification of things and forgetting the truth
 swadhinata ke baad se hamaare desh main, hindi ke bare main kutarkon ke aise jaal lagaataar failaae jate rahe hai
 The result of that is that Hindi has not been able to find its mandatory historical place till date
 meri jaankaree main kisi mahatvapurn swadhin raashtra main uski rashtrabhasha itane samay tak apdasth nahin rahi
 The situation here is that this cycle is constantly intensifying
 yah sthiti kyon paidaa hui, iske kya kaaran rahe hai, is par ham agle prishthon main vichaar karenge, parantu aaj to desh ke aam padhe likhe logon kii maansikta ko itnaa pradooshit kiya ja chukaa he ki kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki rashtrabhasha ke bare main baat karnaa or sampradayik dange karana ek hi baat he
 Only those who create such cruel and slave mentality remember the British and English Raj with great enthusiasm today - does it not prove that the separation of the British and the British rule in India is to show sheer senselessness
 kathith udaartaa dikhaate hue, swadhinata ke praarambhik najuk or bhavanapurna kaal main ham bhayanak chook kar baithe the
 What was known then was that the decision to release English along with Hindi for 15 years would prove to be a role to overthrow Hindi
 is antaraal main angrejon ke ucchhisht naukarshahon, swaarthee raajnneetigyon, videshi shaktiyon, matlabi poonjipatiyon vagairah ne apni ranneeti taiyaar kar lee thi or bhartiya bhashaaon tathaa praantvaad ko aage karke rashtrabhasha par chautarafa akraman kar diya tha
 We have also seen in history that the East India Company spread its net in India with the help of a slight exemption and later acquired complete sovereignty by grabbing all the native states one by one
 vahi charitra to angreji kaa he-ek rajbhasha ke rup main
 Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia, the penetrator of history and culture, had launched a very right movement - remove English
 is bare main unhone us bujurgi salaah ko najar andaaj kar diya tha ki hindi ko samarth banaaie, naahak angreji kaa virodh kyon karte hai ?’ lohia jaanate the ki is dikhaawati ahimsak salaah ke nihitarth kya hai ? vastav main kisi bhi videshi bhashaa ko rashtrabhasha kaa vikalp banaae rakhana paradheenata ko swadhinata kaa vikalp banaae rakhane kii tarah he
 They also knew that no native language could flourish in the presence of English, as it would continue to thrash one to another according to its historical character

 They often Delhi and its eastern provinces were inhabited extensively and the Brajbhas and Awadhi languages could not adopt due to their illiteracy, so they adopted the dialect of Meerut and its surroundings and named it Khadi dialect

 In the 15th and 16th centuries, some Hindi poets also started using it somewhere in their poetry, but often their number? Was like no
 adhikansh kavita baraabar avadhi or vrajabhasha main hi hoti rahi
 In the 18th century Hindus also began to treat it in literature, but not in poetry, only in prose; And since then, the present Hindi prose was born, whose Acharyas are considered as Sadasukh, Lallu Ji Lal and Sadal Mishra

 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was the first Vice President and Second President of India
 ve bhartiya samskruti ke samvahak, prakhyat shikshavid, mahaan darshanik or ek aasthavan hindu vichaarak the
 Due to his qualities, the Government of India honored him with the highest honor Bharat Ratna in 1954
 unka janmdin bharat main shikshak diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was born on 5 September 1888 in Tirutani village, Tamil Nadu, which is about 64 km from the then Madras
 jis parivaar main unhone janm liya vah ek brahman parivaar tha
 His place of birth has also been noted as a holy pilgrimage place
 radhakrishnan ke purakhe pehle kabhi 'sarvapalli' naamak gram main rahete the or 18veen shatabdi ke madhya main unhone tirutani gram kii ore nishkraman kiya tha
 But his ancestors wanted that there should always be a realization of the village of his birthplace along with his name
 isi kaaran unke parijan apane naam ke purv 'sarvapalli' dhaaran karne lage the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was a child of a poor but learned Brahmin
 unke pita kaa naam 'sarvapalli veeraswami' or mata kaa naam 'sitamma' tha
 His father worked in the revenue department
 un par bahut bade parivaar ke bharan-poshan kaa daayitv tha
 Veeraswamy had five sons and a daughter
 radhakrishnan kaa sthaan in santatiyon main doosraa tha
 His father was discharging the family with great difficulty
 is kaaran balak radhakrishnan ko bachapan main koi vishesh sukh praapt nahin hua
 Radhakrishnan's childhood was spent in religious places like Tirutani and Tirupati
 unhone pratham aath varsh tirutani main hi gujaarey
 Although his father was old-minded and had religious sentiments, he sent Radhakrishnan to study at the Christian missionary institution Lutheran Mission School, Tirupati between 1896–1900
 phir agle 4 varsh kii unki shiksha vellore main hui
 He then studied at Madras Christian College, Madras
 vah bachapan se hi medhaavi the
 During these 12 years of study, Radhakrishnan also remembered important portions of the Bible
 iske liye unhen vishisht yogyata kaa sammaan pradaan kiya gaya
 At this age, he also studied Veer Savarkar and Swami Vivekananda
 unhone 1902 main metric str kii pariksha uteern kii or unhen chaatravrutti bhi praapt hui
 After this he passed the Faculty of Arts examination in first class in 1904
 unhen manovigyaan, itihaas or ganit vishay main vishesh yogyata kii tippanee bhi ucch praptankon ke kaaran mili
 Apart from this, Christian College, Madras also gave him a scholarship
 darshanashastra main em0e0 karne ke pashchaat 1916 main ve madras residency college main darshanashastra ke sahaayak praadhyaapak niyukt hue
 Later he was also a professor in the same college
 dow radhakrishnan ne apane lekhon or bhaashanon ke madhyam se vishwa ko bhartiya darshan shaastra se parichit karaayaa
 His articles were praised all over the world
 us samay madras ke brahman pariwaron main kam umr main hi shaadi sampann ho jaati thi or radhakrishnan bhi uske apwaad nahin rahe
 In 1903, at the age of 16, he was married to Sivakamu, the sister of a distant relationship
 us samay unki patni kii aayu maatr 10 varsh kii thi
 So, after three years, his wife started living with him
 yadhyapi unki patni sivaakamu ne paramparaagat rup se shiksha praapt nahin kii thi, lekin unka telegu bhashaa par acha adhikaar tha
 She could also write and read English
 1908 main radhakrishnan dampati ko santaan ke rup main putree kii prapti hui
 In 1908, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the first class and got special qualification in philosophy
 shaadi ke 6 varsh baad hi 1909 main unhone kala main snatakottar pariksha bhi uteern kar lee
 The subject of his philosophy was philosophy
 ucch adhyayan ke dauraan vah apni nijee aamadani ke liye bacchon ko tution padhaane kaa kaam bhi karte rahe
 In 1908 he also wrote a research article to obtain the title of MA
 is samay unki aayu maatr bees varsh kii thi
 This increased his knowledge of the scriptures
 sheeghra hi unhone vedon or upanishdon kaa bhi gahan adhyayan kar liya
 Apart from this, he also studied Hindi and Sanskrit language very interestingly
 shiksha kaa prabhaav jahaan prayek vyakti par nishchit rup se padataa he, vahiin shaikshik santhaan kii gunvattta bhi apana prabhaav chhodti he
 At that time Western values of life were deeply instilled within the students by Christian institutions
 yahi kaaran he ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon main adhyayan karte hue radhakrishnan ke jivan main ucch gun samahit ho gayi
 But there was also another change in them which was due to Christian institutions
 kuch log hindutvvaadi vichaaron ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unki aalochana karte the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan took his criticism as a challenge and started to study Hindu scriptures deeply
 dow radhakrishnan yah jaananaa chaahate the ki vastutah kis samskruti ke vichaaron main chetanta he or kis samskruti ke vichaaron main jadta he? tab swaabhaavik antarpragna dwaara is baat par dridhtaa se vishwaas karnaa armbh kar diya ki bharat ke duurastha sthanon par rahane vaale garib tathaa anpadh vyakti bhi pracheen satya ko jaanate the
 For this reason Radhakrishnan came to know comparatively that Indian spirituality is very rich and criticisms of Hinduism by Christian missionaries are baseless
 isse inhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki bhartiya samskruti dharm, gyaan or satya par aadhaarit he jo praani ko jivan kaa sachcha sandesh detii he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan had well known that life is very short but the happiness prevailing in it is uncertain
 is kaaran vyakti ko sukh-dukh main sambhaav se rahanaa chaiye
 In fact, death is an unshakable truth, which makes the rich poor all their grass and does not make any kind of class distinction
 sachcha gyaan vahi he jo aapke andar ke agyaan ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 a life of simplistic contentment is better than the egoistic life of the rich, in whom dissatisfaction resides
 ek shant mastishk behatar he, taaliyon kii un gadgadahaton se; jo sansadon evam darbaron main sunaayi detii hai
 In fact, this is why Dr
 Radhakrishnan was able to understand the moral values of Indian culture, because he wanted to test the truth of the criticisms made by the missionaries themselves
 isiilie kaha gaya he ki aalochanaayen parishuddhi kaa kaary karti hai
 All mothers want to see higher values in their children
 isi kaaran ve bacchon ko ishwar par vishwaas rakhane, paap se dur rahane evam musiibat main phase logon kii madad karne kaa paath padhaati hai
 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also learned that respect for all religions has been taught in Indian culture and the sense of equality for all religions is also a unique identity of Hindu culture
 is prakaar unhone bhartiya samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan ko samajha or uske kaafii nazadik ho gayi
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan considered the whole world as a school
 unka maananaa tha ki shiksha ke dwaara hi maanav mastishk kaa sadupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the world should manage education as a single entity
 britain ke edinbura vishvavidhyalay main diye apane bhaashan main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne kaha tha- "maanav ko ek hona chahie
 The complete goal of human history is the liberation of mankind only when the basis of the policies of the countries is to try to establish peace all over the world
 " dow radhakrishnan apni buddhi se paripurna vyakhyaaon, anandadaayi abhivyaktiyon or halki gudgudane vaali kahaniyon se chaatro ko mantramugdh kar dete the
 He also used to motivate his students to adopt high moral values in their conduct
 vah jis bhi vishay ko padhaate the, pehle swayan uskaa gahan adhyayan karte the
 He used to make even a serious subject like philosophy, simple, interesting and dear to his style
 1909 main 21 varsh kii umr main dow radhakrishnan ne madras presidency college main kanishtha vyaakhyaata ke taur par darshan shaastra padhaanaa prarambh kiya
 It was his best fortune that he got a livelihood suited to his nature
 yahan unhone 7 varsh tak na keval adhyaapan kaary kiya apitu swayan bhi bhartiya darshan or bhartiya dharm kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya
 In those days, it was necessary for the lecturer that he should also get training for teaching
 isi kaaran 1910 main radhakrishnan ne shikshan kaa prashikshan madras main lenaa armbh kar diya
 At this time, his salary was only 37 rupees
 darshan shaastra vibhaag ke tatkaaleen profesar radhakrishnan ke darshan shastreey gyaan se kaafii abhibhoot hue
 They allowed him to be absent from philosophy classes
 lekin iske badale main yah shart rakhi ki vah unke sthaan par darshanashastra kii kakshaon main padhaa den
 Then Radhakrishna gave thirteen such impressive lectures to his classmates, which surprised even those learners
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki unki vishay par gahari pakad thi, darshan shaastra ke sambandh main drushtikon spasht tha or vyaakhyaan dete samay unhone upyukt shabdon kaa chayan bhi kiya tha
 a short booklet titled "essential Elements of Psychology" by Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was also published in 1912 which was a collection of his lectures given in class
 is pustika ke dwaara unki yah yogyata pramanit hui ki "prayek pad kii vyakhya karne ke liye unke paas shabdon kaa atul bhandar to he hi, unki samaran shakti bhi atyant vilakshan he
 " jab dow radhakrishnan europe evam america pravaas se punah bharat laute to yahan ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ne unhen maanad oopaadhiyaan pradaan kar unki vidvatta kaa sammaan kiya
 In the winter of 1928, he first met Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru when he came to Calcutta to attend the annual session of the Congress Party
 yadhyapi sarvapalli radhakrishnan bhartiya shaikshik seva ke sadsy hone ke kaaran kisi bhi raajnneetik sambhaashan main hissedari nahin kar sakate the, tathaapi unhone is varjana kii koi parvaah nahin kii or bhaashan diya
 In 1929, he was invited by the 'university of Manchester' to give lectures
 inhone maanchester evam landan main kai vyaakhyaan diye
 The following institutional service functions are seen in the scope of their educational achievements- sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne aisa hi kiya or thik raatri 12 baje apane sambodhan ko viraam diya
 None other than Pandit Nehru and Radhakrishnan were aware of this
 azaadi ke baad unase aagrah kiya gaya ki vah mathrubhumi kii seva ke liye vishisht rajdoot ke rup main soviet sangh ke saath rajanyik kaaryon kii purti karen
 Thus, he was chosen as the new successor of Vijayalakshmi Pandit
 pandit nehru ke is chayan par kai vyaktiyon ne aashcharya vyakt kiya ki ek darshanashastri ko rajanyik sevaaon ke liye kyon chunaa gaya? unhen yah sandeh tha ki doctor radhakrishnan kii yogyataayen saunpi gai zimmedaari ke anukool nahin hai
 But Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan later proved that he was the best Indian diplomat appointed in Moscow
 ve ek gaiyr paramparawaadi rajanyik the
 Mantras which were late at night, they used to participate in them till 10 o'clock in the night, because after that their sleeping time was over
 jab radhakrishnan ek shikshak the, tab bhi ve niyamon ke daayaron main nahin bandhe the
 He used to come 20 minutes late to class and leave ten minutes earlier
 inkaa kahana tha ki kaksha main inhen jo vyaakhyaan dena hota tha, vah 20 minute ke paryaapt samay main sampann ho jaataa tha
 Even after this, he remained the beloved and respected teacher of the students
 1952 main soviet sangh se aane ke baad doctor radhakrishnan uparashtrapati nirvaachit kiye gayi
 a new post of Vice President was created under the Constitution
 nehru ji ne is pad hetu radhakrishnan kaa chayan karke punah logon ko chaunkaa diya
 He wondered why no Congress party politician was elected for the post
 uparashtrapati ke rup main radhakrishnan ne rajyasabha main adhyaksh kaa padbhaar bhi sambhaala
 In 1952, he became the Vice President of India
 baad main pandit nehru kaa yah chayan bhi sarthak siddh hua, kyonki uparashtrapati ke rup main ek gaiyr raajnneetijna vyakti ne sabhi raajnneetigyon ko prabhavit kiya
 All the members of Parliament appreciated him for his work
 inaki sadashyata, dridhtaa or vinodi swabhaav ko log aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The birthday of Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second but unique President of our country, is celebrated every year as 'teacher's Day'
 is din samast desh main bharat sarkaar dwaara shreshth shikshakon ko puraskaar bhi pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Although he was conferred with the title of "sir" by the British Empire in 1931, his justification for Dr
 Radhakrishnan had ended after attaining independence

 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa

 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc

 hypothelemus main leptin ke receptor paae jate hai jo jienarech banaate hai
 People who are deficient in leptin do not start puberty
 Leptin levels rise with the onset of puberty and fall to adulthood levels after completion of puberty
 jienarech main vruddhi anuvanshiki ke kaaran bhi ho sakati he
 One study showed that changes in genes containing neurokinin b and neurokinin b receptor can alter the timing of puberty
 shodhakartaaon kii dharna he ki kispeptin, jienarech ko utpann karne ke liye pratyaksh taur par tathaa alech or enne ko utpann karne ke liye, apratyaksh taur par jimmedaar ek yogic ke srav ko niyantrit karne main neurokinin bi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he In boys, the increase in size of the testes is the first physical manifestation of puberty and is called gonadarche
 yuvavastha kii shuruyaat se 1 varsh pehle ladakon main vrishanon kaa aakaar ausatan 2-3 semi lambaa tathaa lagbhag 1
5-2 semi chaudaa ho jaataa he
 The size of the testes continues throughout puberty, and reaches its maximum adult size after the first 6 years of puberty
 ladke ke andkosh badhane tathaa viksit hone ke ek saal baad, ling kii lambaai or chaudaai badhati he tathaa nasen bhi vayaskta anupaaton ke anusaar viksit hone lagati hai
 While the size of an average adult is 18–20 cc, there is a wide variation in the size of the testicles in the general population
 andkosh ke do mukhya kaary hote hai: hormone utpann karnaa tathaa shukranu utpann karnaa
 Leydig cells produce testosterone, which in turn produces pubertal changes in men
 andakoshon ke oottakon main hone vaali adhiktar vruddhi shukranu utpann karne vaale oottakon kii hoti he or ledig koshikaayen)
 yuvavastha ke badlaavon ke pratham varsh main or kabhi kabhi pehle hi, praatavkaal main ladakon ke mutr main shukranu dekhe ja sakate hai
 On average, the fertility of boys develops at the age of 13, but full fertility does not develop before the age of 14–16
 yahaan yah bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki yuvavastha ke dauraan purush ke vrushan kaa aakaar bad jayega or yah sakht rahane kii bajaay jhulane yaa sharir se neeche latakane lagegaa, aisa shukranu ke utpaadan ko samyojit karne ke liye hota he kyonki andkosh ko upjau bane rahane ke liye ek nishchit taapmaana kii jarurat hoti he
 Shortly after the development of a boy's genitalia, the hairs of the genitals begin to appear
 guptang ke bal aamtaur par pehali baar ling ke pichley bhaag par dikhaai dete hai
 The first few hairs are described as stage 2
 charan 3 aamtaur par 6-12 maheenon ke bich main hota he, jab baalo ko ginana asambhav ho jaataa he
 By step 4, the pubic hairs completely cover the "genitals triangle"
 charan 5 main guptang ke bal jaanghon tak tathaa pet ke baalo ke vikaas ke rup main naabhi se upar kii ore tak fail jate hai
 In the months and years after the pubic hairs appear, androgenic hairs may develop in other parts of the skin due to the reaction of androgens
 saamaanya anukram he: bagalon ke bal, guda ke aas paas bal, upree hont ke bal, kalmon ke bal, stan ke aas paas ke bal or dadhi kshetra main
 maanav jaivik prakriyaaon main atyaadhik vividhta ke kaaran, kuch vyaktiyon main ye vishisht kram bhinn ho sakate hai
 The hairs of the arm, leg, chest, abdomen and back become thicker respectively
 vayask purushon ke shaareerik baalo main atyaadhik vividhta pai jaati he, tathaa vibhinn jaateey samoohon main baalo ke vikaas ke samay tathaa maatra main lakshaneey antar paae jate hai
 Facial hair often arrives at the end of adolescence, but may not come until much later
 yuvavastha ke 2-4 varshon tak chehre ke bal kramshah khurdure, gahare tathaa mote hote jate hai
 Some men do not get full facial hair even after 10 years of puberty
 Chest hair may appear during puberty or some years after it
 sabhi purushon ke seene par bal nahin hote
 Under the influence of androgens, the voice box, or larynx, grows in both sexes
 yah vikaas ladakon main kahin adhik pramukh he, jisase purushon kii awaz baari tathaa gahari ho jaati he, kabhi-kabhi achaanak, lekin shaayad "ek raat main" ek sur tak, kyonki lambi tathaa moti dhwani peshiyon main ek kam moulik aavriti hoti he
 Before puberty, the larynx of boys and girls is almost equally small
 kabhi-kabhi, aprashikshit awaajon ke praarambhik charnon main swaron kii asthirataa ke saath awaz main badlaav hota he
 Most voice changes occur during stages 3–4, around the time of peak development of male puberty
 15 saal kii ausat umr main purna vayask swarman praapt ho jaataa he
 aisa aamtaur par chehre ke mahatvapurn baalo ke vikaas ke kuch maheenon se saalon pehle tak ho saktaa he
 By the end of puberty, the bones of adult males become relatively heavy and nearly double that of skeletal muscle
 kuch haddiyon kaa vikaas tulanaatmak rup se atyaadhik asangat dhang se hota he, jiske kaaran nar or maadaa ke kankal main lakshaneey antar paaya jaataa he
 On average, an adult male accounts for about 150% of an average female's weight and about 50% of body fat
 mansapeshiyon kaa vikaas mukhyatah yuvavastha ke antim charnon main hota he or mansapeshiyon kii vruddhi ladke ke jaivik rup se vayask hone ke baad bhi jari rah sakati he
 The so-called "energetic strength", the rate of muscle growth, is attained approximately one year after a man attains his peak growth rate
 aksar, nar ke vakshasthal ke oottakon ke paas vasa ikatthi hoti he or nar ke stnegar yuvavastha ke dauraan viksit hote hai, kabhi kabhi vishesh rup se ek vaksh par aisa hone se yah or spasht dikhaai dene lagata he or ise gayanacomestia kaha jaataa he
 This is usually not a permanent event
 androgen kaa badhata str paseene kii fatty acid sanrachana badal saktaa he, jiske parinamswaroop or adhik "vayask" sharir kii gandh praapt ho sakati he
 Like girls, another effect of androgens can increase the secretion of oil from the skin, which can cause different amounts of acne
 muhaanson se aasaani se roka yaa khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin yuvavastha ke ant main ye aam taur par puri tarah khatm ho jate hai
 Although it is not uncommon for a full-grown adult to suffer from acne frequently, it is generally less severe than acne in adolescents
 kuch vayask muhaanson se bachane ke liye khaas kriimon yaa marahamon kaa prayog kar sakate hai, yaa dawaaen bhi kha sakate hai, jiskaa kaaran yah he ki bhaavnaatmak rup se muhaanson ko sahan karnaa kathin hota he or ye chehre ko daraavna banaate hai
 Usually the first physical obvious sign of puberty in girls, which occurs at about 10
5 years of age, is a soft nodule hanging down the middle portion of the areola of one or both breasts
 ise stan vikaas ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 In the widely used tanner stage for puberty, it is stage 2 of breast development
 
 chah se 12 maheenon ke bheetar, donon taraf sujan spasht rup se shuru ho jaati he, kam hoti he or ise ariola ke kinaaron ke baahar nikalataa hua mahasoos kiya or dekha ja saktaa he
 This is stage 3 of breast development
 agle 12 maheenon tak, ariola tathaa stnegar ke aas-paas ke kshetra kii tilenuma akruti ke saath, stan paripakv akruti or aakaar ke ho jate hai
 In most young women, this mound dissolves into the outline of the mature breast, although there are so many variations in the shape and size of adult breasts that they cannot always be distinguished separately in stages 4 and 5
 guptang ke bal aamtaur par yuvavastha kaa doosraa dhyaan dene yogya parivartan he, jo stan vikaas ke aksar ek kuch maheene ke bheetar shuru hota he
 This change is known as pubarche
 aamtaur par guptang ke bal pehle lebia par dikhaai dete hai
 The first few hairs are described as tanner stage 2
 aamtaur par 6-12 maheene ke bich charan 3 shuru ho jaataa he, jisamen baalo ko ginana asambhav hota he or ye yoni ke paas bhi prakat hone lagate hai
 By step 4, the pubic hairs cover the "genitals triangle"
 charan 5 guptang ke baalo ke jaanghon tak tathaa kabhi-kabhi pet ke baalo ke rup main urdhv disha main naabhi tak failane se sambandhit he
 In 15% of girls, early pubic hair starts appearing before breast development
 estrogen kaa str badhane ke kaaran yoni kii mucosal sataha main bhi badlaav aata he, jisase yah adhik moti or fike gulabi rang kii ho jaati he
 
 White secretion is also a common effect of estrogen
 thelarche ke do saal baad, yoni main sthit garbhashay, andashay or koshon kaa aakaar bad jaataa he
 There is often a small pimple in the ovary that is visible by ultrasound

 prajnan ke liye andotsarg kaa hona aavashyak he, lekin sambhav he ki aisa shuruuaati masik dharmon ke saath na ho
 After menarche, 80% of the cycles were found to be irregular in the first year, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year
 minarche ke pashchaat andotsarg kii shuruyaat hona anivaary nahin he
 Girls who have a high proportion of irregularities and ovulation problems in the menstrual cycle for several years after menarche have a higher risk of decreased fertility
 prajnan kshamta ke sanketak ke rup main vivaah-yogyata kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 During this period, as the level of estrogen increases, the lower half of the pelvis and hips become wider
 shaareerik sanrachana main purushon kii tulana main, vasa ke oottakon kii maatra mahila main vishesh rup se stanon, kulhon, nitambon, jaanghon, bahon ke upree hisson tathaa yoni ke paas atyaadhik bad jaati he
 The size of a particular woman until the end of puberty depends on variations in fat distribution as well as gender differences in local skeletal development
 ausatan, 10 varsh kii umr main, ladakiyon ke sharir main ladakon kii tulana main 6% vasa adhik pai jaati he
 Increased levels of androgens can alter the fatty acid composition of sweat, resulting in a more "adult" body odor
 aisa aksar thelarche or pubarche ke ek yaa adhik varsh baad hota he
 Another effect of androgens results in increased secretion of oil from the skin
 yah parivartan munhaason, twachaa kii ek aisi sthiti, jo yuvavastha armbh hone kaa sanket he, main vruddhi karata he
 There are many variations in the type of acne
 yuvavastha kii shuruyaat kii paribhaasha swaroop or kaaran par nirbhar karti he
 The most common definition of the onset of puberty is physical changes in a person's body
 These physiological changes are the first direct signs of changes in the functioning of the nervous, hormonal and sexual organs
 aamtaur par vyaktiyon main yuvavastha kii shuruyaat hone kii aayu main vividhta hoti he, aksar yuvavastha 10-13 varsh ke bich shuru hota he
 The age at which puberty begins is influenced by genetic and environmental factors such as nutritional status and social conditions
 saamaajik paristhitiyon kaa ek udhaaharan vandanberg prabhaav he, ek kishor mahila jo vayask purushon ke zyada sampark main rahati he, main yuvavastha kii shuruyaat un kishor mahilaon kii tulana main jaldi hoti he, jo saamaajik taur par vayask purushon ke zyada sampark main nahin rahati
 The average age at which puberty begins may also be influenced by race
 udhaaharan ke liye, vibhinn aabaadiyon ke surveykshan main minarche kii ausat aayu 12 se 18 saal ke bich dekhi gayi he
 Early onset of puberty is higher among African American girls and the latest average is the high altitude subsistence population in Asia

 The median age of menarche in a population may be a list of malnourished girls in that population and its diversity may reflect an abnormality of wealth and food distribution in the population
 shodhakartaaon ne yuvavastha kii shuruyaat kii pehali umr kii pahchaan kar lee he
 However, their conclusions are based on a comparison of the 1999 data with the 1969 data
 pehle udhaaharan main, namoonay ke taur par lee gayi aabaadi shwet ladakiyon par aadhaarit thi
 Subsequent studies have shown that puberty begins in 48% of African American girls at the age of nine and in 12% of white girls by this age
 ausat aayu, jisamen yuvavastha kii shuruyaat hoti he, main 1840 ke dashak ke baad giravat aayi he
 Researchers call this decline an 'earthly trend'
 1840 se 1950 tak har dashak main pashchimi europea mahilaon ke bich main minarche kii ausat umr main chaar maheene kii giravat thi
 Girls born in 1840 in Norway underwent menarche at an average age of 17 years

 The average in England in 1840 was 16
5 years
 japan main giravat der se ai or tab yah adhik teevr thi: japan main 1945 se 1975 tak prati dashak 11 maheenon kii giravat dekhi gai
 a 2006 study in Denmark found that puberty began as an evidence of breast development at an average age of 9 years and 10 months, which was 1 year before a similar study in 1991

 Various studies have found that genetic effects are responsible for variations in sexual timing in 46% of cases in the correct nutritional population
 maataaon or betiyon ke bich samay kaa anuvanshik sambandh sabase majboot he
 The specific genes affecting time are not yet known
 iname se ek androgen receptor jin ho saktaa he
 Researchers have hypothesized that some products containing hair care estrogen or the placenta, and certain chemicals such as phthalates that are used in cosmetics, toys, and plastic food containers, can lead to premature puberty
 
 agar anuvaanshik kaarak samay se pehle yuvavastha shuru hone ke pachaas pratishat jimmevaar hai, to paryaavaran kaarak bhi utane hi mahatvapurn hai
 One of the earliest observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs late in children living at high altitudes

 There is a theoretical concern and evidence from animals that environmental hormones and chemicals may affect aspects of sexual development in humans before or after delivery
 bade shaharon main kaaphi maatra main pharmaceutical utpaadon se adhure metabolise estrogen or progestagen sivej system main utsarjit kiye jate hai or kabhi-kabhi vaataavaran main pahachaane ja sakate hai
 Sex steroids are sometimes used in animal farming but are prohibited for 40 years for chicken meat production
 haalanki krishi kanoon kam se kam aakasmik maanav upbhog ko viniyamit karte hai, kaaphi had tak ye niyam sanyukt rajya america main lagu kiye gaye hai
 The child's direct contact with hormones or other substances that activate estrogen or androgen receptors can cause some or all of the changes in puberty
 pisibi jaise faile hue rasayanon ke yuvavastha par prabhaav kii jaanch or bhi kathin he, jo estrogen receptaron ko roak yaa chhod sakate hai
 a small but direct threat to partial puberty is young children taking at-home sexual drugs, which can be identified during a clinical examination of precocious puberty, but mild effects and other potential aforementioned hazards

 Scientists are concerned about the effect of BPA on fetuses, infants and children and the current level of contact, as it can affect the prostate, mammary gland, and premature puberty in girls
 bipie estrogen, jo ek mahatvapurn prajnan or vikaas niamak he, kii nakal or uski karypranali main hastkshep karata he
 It mixes with plastic in food and fluids, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a significantly higher level of BPA was found in more than 90 percent of the US population during the study
 aisa anumaan he ki shishuon or bacchon dwaara ucchtam maatra main BPA grahan kiya jaataa he
 BPA is found in many plastic bottles and BPA is more likely to spread as the temperature rises, that is, when a baby boils or keeps food in the microwave
 poshan kaarak yuvavastha ke samay ko prabhavit karne vaale sabase majboot or spasht paryaavarniya kaarak hai
 Girls are particularly sensitive to nutrition regulation, as they must receive complete nutrition for fetal development
 atirikt calories se sharir main vasa kii maatra bad jaati he, jisase mastishk ko yah sanket miltaa heki yuvavastha tathaa prajnan prakriyaaon kii shuruyaat ke liye sansaadhan uplabdh hai
 Much of the evidence suggests that for the last few centuries, nutrition differences are the main reason for variation at the time of puberty, even among most populations and social classes in the same population
 duniya bhar main badhati pashu protein kii khapat, poshan main anya parivartan or bachapan main badhata motopa samay se pehle yuvavastha aarambh hone kaa mukhya kaaran he, vishesh rup se un aabaadiyon main jinamein pichhali umr zyada rahi he
 In many populations the amount of nutrition types is shrinking
 haalanki uplabdh aahaar urja kaa yuvavastha ke samay par sabase mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he, isamen aahaar kii gunvattta kii bhi ek bhoomika hoti he
 Low-protein and high-fiber diets, as in certain vegetarian diets, are associated with the late onset and slow development of women's puberty
 vaigyanik shodhakartaaon ne shuruuaati motaape ko ladakiyon main yuvavastha kii jaldi shuruyaat ke saath joda he
 She has cited breast development before nine years and menarche before twelve years as obesity
 ladakiyon main yuvavastha kii jald shuruyaat swasthya samasyaon kii jad kahi ja sakati he
 Average levels of daily physical activity have also been seen to affect the timing of puberty, especially in women
 vyaayaam kaa ek ucch str, chaahe athlettic yaa sharir kii chhavi ke liye kiya jaae, yaa phir dainik jivan nirvaah ke liye, prajnan ke liye uplabdh urja calories kam kar detaa he or yuvavastha ko dhimaa kar detaa he
 The effect of exercise is often increased by reduced weight and cholesterol
 puraane rog ladakon or ladakiyon donon kii yuvavastha main deree kar sakate hai
 Those who have permanent illnesses or lack of nutrition are the most affected

 In girls aged 15 and 19, 40% of cases are due to diet related disorders
 yuvavastha ke samay par kuch sabase kam samajhe gayi paryaavarniya prabhaavon main saamaajik or manovaigyanik prabhaav shaamil hai
 Compared to the effects of genetics, nutrition and general health, the social effects are small, which can change the changes of puberty from a few months to years
 in saamaajik prabhaavon kii karypranali agyaat he, haalanki bataaya jaataa he ki shaareerik prakriyaaon ke kai prakaar, jinamein pheromone bhi shaamil he, jaanwaron par kiye gayi shodh par aadhaarit he
 The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most social impact research has examined family structure and its relationship with early or late onset of female puberty
 zyaadaatar adhyayan bataate hai ki ucch tanaav vaale gharon main un ladakiyon main minarche kii avasthaa pehle ho sakati he, jinke pita unke shuruuaati bachapan main anupasthit the, yaa jinke ghar main sautela pita tha, yaa jinka bachapan main lambe samay tak yon shoshan hota rahaa he, yaa jinhen vikasshil deshon se kam umr main god liya gaya he
 Conversely, menarche may appear late in girls who grow up in a large family with a biological father
 paryaavarniya tanaav kii asahneeya seemaa, jaise yuddh ke samay sharnaarthi kii sthiti, jisamen shaareerik suraksha ko khatra ho, ko paripakvata main deree se judaa paaya gaya he, ek aisa prabhaav jo aahaar kii aparyaaptta se jatil ho saktaa he
 Most of these so-called social influences are minor and not fully understood by us
 adhikansh "prabhaav" aankadon ke rup main hai jo mahamari ke dauraan hue surveykshanon se pataa chale hai
 Statistical associations are not necessarily facts and a wide variety of transformations and alternative explanations can be imagined
 kisi bhi chote bachche par itani choti maatra main padane vaale prabhaav kii pushti yaa khandan karnaa kabhi bhi sambhav nahin he
 Furthermore, the interpretation of data is politically disputed as this type of research can be used for political advocacy
 raajnneetik agenda ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav ke aarope kabhi kabhi vaigyanik aalochana ke saath lagate rahe hai
 Another drawback of social research is that almost all of them are related to girls, some because female puberty requires greater physical resources and some because it involves a unique phenomenon that allows women survey research to be associated with men
 Makes it easier
 adhik jaankaree minarche lekh main di gayi he
 The sequence of events of pubertal development can sometimes vary
 udhaaharan ke liye, 15% ladke or ladakiyon main, pubarche, gonadarche or thelarche se kramshah kuch maheene pehle ho saktaa he
 Rarely, menarche occurs in some of the girls before other signs of puberty appear
 ye parivartan chikitsa moolyankanon ke laayak he kyonki inase kabhi kabhi ek rog kaa sanket miltaa he
 In a general sense, the culmination of puberty is reproductive maturity

 On average, a girl attains the maximum adult height at an average age of 15 years and a boy at an average age of 18 years
 sambhavit prajnan kshamta, ladakiyon main saamanytah 1-2 saal tathaa ladakon main vikaas ke 3-4 saal puure hone se pehle aati he
 Stage 5 typically represents maximal development of the genitals and adult hormone levels
 kai anya shaareerik pranaaliyon kii pratikriyaaon or viniman ke saath, endosirin prajnan pranali hypothelemus, pituitary, jananaang tathaa adrenal grathiyon se mil kar banati he
 Real puberty is called "central puberty" because it begins due to the process of the central nervous system
 hormonal yuvavastha kaa ek saral vivaran is prakaar he: The onset of this neurohormonal process may occur 1–2 years before the first direct physiological change
 hypothelemus kaa arcuat nabhik prajnan pranali kaa sanchaalak he
 It contains neurons that generate the senses of gnrh in the portal venous system of the pituitary gland
 arcuat nabhik ko mastishk ke anya hisson kii tantrikaon kii pratikriyaaon or yonang, adepos utakon or vibhinn prakaar kii anya pranaaliyon se praapt hormonon dwaara prabhavit or niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 The pituitary gland processes the pulsed gnrh in the normal flow of blood, leaving LH and FSH in a pulsed pattern
 jananaang, testosterone evam estrogen steroid sex hormone utpann kar ke alech va enne ke badhate str ke prati pratikriya karte hai
 The adrenal glands are another source of steroid hormones
 adrenal paripakvata, jise adrenarche kaha jaataa he, aam taur par bachapan ke madhya main gonadarche se pehle hoti he
 The endocrine reproductive system becomes functional by the end of the first trimester of fetal life
 janm ke samay vrushan or andashay kuch samay tak niskriy rahete hai kintu janm ke kai maheenon baad hormonal gatividhi phir se shuru karte hai, jab mastishk kaa na samajha ja sakane vaala tantra arcuat nabhik kii prakriya ko roktaa he
 This has been referred to as the maturity of the pre-pubertal "gonadostat", which becomes susceptible to negative feedback by sex steroids

 Gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels fall below about 8 to 10 years of childhood
 There is increasing evidence that the reproductive system is not completely dysfunctional during childhood years
 There is a slight increase in gonadotrophin senses, and future eggs in the ovarian sac surrounding germ cells double in number
 arcuat nabhik main pulse janarator ke nishedh ke saath hi hypothelemus main saamaanya yuvavastha kii prakriya armbh hoti he
 This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an active inhibition released by other areas of the brain
 signal or tantra jo nishedh se arcuat nabhik ko chhodte hai, dashakon se jaanch kaa vishay hai or puri tarah se samajhe nahin ja sake hai
 Leptin levels increase throughout childhood and allow the arcuate nucleus to process
 agar bachapan main arcuat nabhik kaa vikaas mastishk main chot ke kaaran samay se pehle baadhit ho jaae, to yah gonodotrophin indriyon ko sanchalit kar saktaa he jisase umr se pehle yuvavastha kii prakriya aarambh ho jaayegi
 Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone) into the blood of the pituitary portal system
 ek america physiologist, ernest nobil ne paaya ki hypothelemus se jienarech sanket lagbhag 1-2 ghante ke antaraal par nabz ko alech ) ke srav ke liye prerit karte hai
 LH veins are caused by gnrh secretion caused by the rupture of the arcuate nucleus, which itself, is caused by the shivering of signals or signal generators of the central brain system

 By the end of puberty, there is little difference in the intensity and frequency of gonadotrophin senses during the day and night
 kuch jaanchakartaaon ne yuvavastha kii shuruyaat ke liye mastishk main kanpakanpi kii pratidhwani ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Accordingly, this statement represents the senses of the genitals bursting into the night shortly before puberty

 Regulation of the adrenarche and its relation to the maturation of hypothalamic genitals has not yet been fully understood, and according to some evidence it is a large independent process parallel to or beyond puberty
 adrenal androgen ke badhate str kii 6 va 11 varsh ke bich, yahaan tak ki hypothelemic yuvavastha kii jananaang nason kii vruddhi se pehle bhi, pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 Adrenal androgens are responsible for genital hair, adult body odor and other androgenic changes in both sexes

 However, in adolescent boys, a significant portion of testosterone is converted to estradiol
 estrodeol vikaas main oochaal, haddi kii paripakvata or ladakiyon kii tarah ladakon main apifizal ko band karne ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Estradiol also induces the development of breast tissue in a large proportion in boys
