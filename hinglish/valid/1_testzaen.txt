 Modern era 1850 This era of Hindi literature began to germinate the seeds of nationalism in India
 swatantraaa sangram ladaa or jeeta gaya
 Raids were invented, means of transport became part of the life of the common man, various means of mass communication developed, radio, TV and newspapers became part of every household and education was the fundamental right of every person
 in sab paristhitiyon kaa prabhaav hindi sahitya par anivarytah padaa
 The Hindi literature of modern times went through many stages of development in the last century
 jisamen anek vichaar dhaaraon kaa bahut tezi se vikaas hua
 Whereas in poetry it was known by the names Chayavadhi Yuga, Progressive Yuga, Experimental Yuga, New Kavya Yuga and Sixti Kavita, the verse before Chhayavad was divided into two more eras of Bharatendu Harishchandra Yuga and Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi Yuga
 iske vishesh kaaran bhi hai
 Bharatendu Harishchandra has had a profound influence on poems from 1850 to 1900 CE
 ve hi aadhunik hindi sahitya ke pitamah hai
 He tried to give language a moving look
 aapke kavy-sahitya main pracheen evam naveen kaa mail lakshith hota he
 Devotional, ritualistic traditions can be seen in your poetry, then modern new ideas and expressions are also found in your poems
 aapane bhakthi-pradhan, shringaar-pradhan, desh-prem-pradhan tathaa saamaajik-samasya-pradhan kavitaayen kii hai
 You tried to move hindi-kavita from Braj Bhasha towards Khadiboli
 aapke yug main anya kai mahanubhav aise hai jinhone vividh prakaar hindi sahitya ko samrudhd kiya
 The main poets of this period are- san 1900 ke baad do dashakon par pan mahavir prasad dvivedi kaa puraa prabhaav padaa
 This era is called Dwivedi-era
 'saraswati' patrika ke sampadak ke rup main aap us samay puure hindi sahitya par chhaae rahe
 With your inspiration, Braj-language deviated from Hindi poetry and Khadi Boli replaced it
 bhashaa ko sthir, parishkrut evam vyakaran-sammat banane main aapane bahut parishram kiya
 From poetry point of view it was a historical era
 adarshavaad kaa bolbalaa rahaa
 India's bright past, patriotism, social reform, self-love, etc
 were the main themes of the poem
 nitivaadee vichaardhaara ke kaaran shringaar kaa varnan maryaadit ho gaya
 The development of story and poetry is characteristic of this era
 bhashaa khurdari or saral rahi
 The qualities of sweetness and simplicity had not yet come in standing
 sarvashree maithilisharan gupt, ayodhyasingh upaadhyaay 'hariudh', shridhar pathak, ramanaresh treepathi aadi is yug ke yashasvi kavi hai
 Jagannathdas 'ratnakar' presented Saras compositions in the Braj language in this era
 is yug ke pramukh kavi- Around 1920, there was an influx of imaginative, free-spirited and emotional poems in Hindi
 yah europe ke romantisism se prabhavit thi
 There was newness in terms of emotion, style, verses, ornamentation
 bharat kii raajnneetik swatantraaa ke baad lokapriy hui is kavita ko aalochakon ne chhayavaadi yug kaa naam diya
 At that time there was heavy criticism of the poetical poets but today it is undisputed fact that the best achievement of modern Hindi poetry was done by poets of this time
 jaishankar prasad, niraala, sumitranandan pant, mahadevi verma is yug ke pradhan kavi hai
 This period has been a period of great turmoil in Indian politics
 rashtriya or antarrashtriya, kai vichaardhaaraon or aandolanon kaa prabhaav is kaal kii kavita par pa dow dwitiya vishwayuddh ke bhayaavah parinaamon ke prabhaav se bhi is kaal kii kavita bahut had tak prabhavit he
 In conclusion, various types of poems were written in this period, nationalist, Gandhian, radical, progressive, realistic, realist
 is kaal ke pramukh kavi hai-- The shadowy poetry remained only among the intellectuals
 jan-jan kii vaani yah nahin ban sakaa
 Social and political movements did not directly affect the poetry of this era
 sansar main samaajawaadee vichaardhaara tezi se fail rahi thi
 Public opinion began to be drawn against the exploitation of the proletariat
 isaki pratichhaya hindi kavita par bhi padi or hindi sahitya ke pragativaadee yug kaa janm hua
 Hindi poetry after 1930 is influenced by such progressive ideology
 1936 main "pragatisheel lekhak sangh" ke gathan ke saath hindi sahitya main marxvaadi vichaardhaara se prerit pragativaadee aandolan kii shuruyaat hui 
iskaa sabase adhik doorgaami prabhaav hindi aalochana par padaa
 Marxist critics started an attempt to re-evaluate the entire history of Hindi literature from the point of view of class struggle
 pragativaadee kaviyon me nagarjun, kedarnath agarwal or trilochan ke saath nayi kavita ke kavi muktibodh or shamsher ko bhi rakkha jaataa he
 After the Second World War, a wave of great despair and depression spread throughout the world
 sahitya par bhi iskaa prabhaav padaa
 In 1943, 'tar Saptak' was published in editing of 'agyeya' tab se hindi kavita main prayogvaadi yug kaa janm hua aisi manyata he
 The developed form of this is called the new poem
 durbodhata, niraashaa, kuntha, vaiyaktikta, chandaheenata ke akshep is kavita par bhi kiye gaye hai
 In fact, the new poem is a reflection of new interest
 is dhara ke mukhya kavi hai- Thus modern Hindi Khadi Boli poetry has also attained the highest peak of achievement in a short time
 kya prabandh kavy, kya muktak kavy, donon main hindi kavita ne sundar rachanaaen praapt kii hai
 Hindi has also got many beautiful compositions in the field of geeti-kavya
 aakaar or prakaar kaa vaividhya barabas hamaara dhyaan aakarshith karata he
 Commendable work has also been done in the fields of music, metaphor, song-drama etc
 kavita ke bahya evam antarang roopon main uganuroop jo naye-naye prayog nity-prati hote rahete hai, ve hindi kavita kii jeevani-shakti evam sphurti ke parichaayak hai

 gayaprasad shukla 'sanehi' ji kaa janm shravan shukla trayodashi, sanwat 1940 vikrameey ko raatri 9:00 baje hua tha
 According to this birth date mentioned by Sanehi himself, his birth is actually proved on the date of August 16, 1883, but English is written on August 21, 1883 in the bracket at the above mentioned place
 chunki trayodashi tithi ke do hi din baad poornima ho jaati he or phir bhadrapada krishna paksh kii prathama, dwitiya aadi tithi aarambh ho jaaegi, isliye hindu panchang ke anusaar ullikhit ukt tithi main mudran truti se paanch dinon kaa antar hona asambhav he
 However, why was the birth date of Sanehiji considered as August 21, 1883 instead of August 16, 1883, it is a subject of independent research

 Pandit Gaya Prasad Shukla ji has written poetry with four surnames - Sanehi, Trishul, Tarangi and Almast
 sarkari naukari ke kaaran unhen apane upnaam 'sanehi' ke atirikt doosraa upnaam 'trishul' rakhana padaa

 Taking retirement from his 22 years of teaching work in 1921, on the call of non-cooperation movement by Mahatma Gandhi, Sanehi ji left the post of Principal of Unnao Town School, request of Amar Shaheed Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi ji and Lala Phoolchand Jain, an exclusive lover of national poetry
 He started coming to Kanpur from Premagraha
 tab se unke jivan kaa adhikansh samay kanpur main hi beetaa
 Once, after leaving the government job, he was disillusioned with the government job in such a way that he did not accept even in 1922, when he was called for teaching work in Kashi Hindu University by Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya

 Now tie two pins at a distance and tie both ends of the length of thread together and wear this dorpash on the pins with a tip of pencil or stylus to keep the loop taut, and then the desired chord will be drawn from the tip

 The concept of Hindi caste is one of the important installations of Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma
 dow ramvilas sharma kii ‘hindi jati' kii avadharana main jati shabd kaa prayog nasl yaa birdari ke liye na hokar rashtriyata ke arth main hua he
 He gave maximum emphasis on this belief
 apni isi sthapana ke kaaran ve sarvaadhik vivaadit or charchit bhi hue
 Seeing the major role of Hindi at the inter-communal level between the dialects like Avadhi, Brajbhasha, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Bundelkhandi, Rajasthani etc
, Ram Vilasji introduced the concept of 'hindi caste', so that these dialects can overcome the feeling of district or regional segregation
 Please accept Hindi as your ethnic language
 'niraala kii sahitya sadhana' dwitiya khand main ise spasht karte hue ramvilas ji ne likhaa he- The concept of Hindi caste is not new
 1902 kii ‘saraswati’ main shri karthik prasad ne ‘maharashtriya jati kaa abhyuday’ naamak lekh likhaa
 Just like there is a Maharashtrian caste in India, so is the Hindi caste in the Hindi heartland

 is kram main unhone rashtriya sampark-bhashaa, rashtrabhasha ke rup main hindi ke vikaas ko rekhaankit kiya, to duusari taraf avadhi, braj, bhojpuri aadi boliyon ke bich hindi ke jaateey bhashaa ke rup main pratishthit hone kaa tathy saamne rakhaa
 Just as the language identifies the castes of Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, etc
, people of the Hindi state should also be identified as a Hindi speaking caste instead of being identified on the basis of the dialects
 dow ramvilas sharma hindi jati ke saath-saath tamil, telugu, oriya, bengali aadi jatiyon kii charchaa bhi karte hai or unke vikaas par bal dete hai
 But they regret that the notion of ethnicity in other language-speaking areas is not as strong as in Hindi, which is why communalism and casteism are most visible in this region
 yah kshetra aaj bhi rajanithik rup se vibhakt he, iskaa kshetra uttar pradesh, uttaranchal, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, bihar, jharkhand, dilli, rajasthan, haryana, himachal pradesh tak vistrut he
 Ram Vilas Sharma continued to protest against the non-adoption of the formula forming the linguistic states in the Hindi region
 is sambandh main pi
en
 singh thik hi likhte hai- “ramvilas ji ko yah baat aaajeevan salti rahi ki bharat main bengali, punjabi, tamil, marathi, gujarati, telugu ityadi jatiyon kaa nirmaan to ho sakaa or ye raajnneetik ikai ke rup main viksit ho sakin lekin hindi pradesh main jaateey bodh kaa abhaav rahaa jiske chalate yah raajnneetik rup se vibhakt rahaa

 pustak kaa vimochan bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi dwaara 30 oktober 2002 ko kiya gaya tha
 Jagadguru Rambhadracharya composed this epic in 2002 at Chitrakoot during his sixth six-month payowrat
 kavi ne sargon kii sankhya ke rup main 21 ko kai kaarnon se chunaa
 He was writing the epic in the early 21st century and in addition it was the first Sanskrit epic to be composed in the 21st century

 Renuka, Parashurama's mother, beats her chest 21 times when the Haihaya king kills her husband Jamadagni
 taduparant parashuram prithvi par kshatriyon kaa 21 baar sanhaar karte hai
 Another cited reason by the poet is that the previous Sanskrit epics included in "shorttrayi" and Brihatatrayi were Meghdutam, Kumarasambhavaam, Kiratarjuniyam, Raghuvansham, Shishupalavadham and Naishadhicharitam composed in Sargo 2, 8, 18, 19, 20 and 22 respectively, and 21

 Although there is no formal division in the epic, poets indicate that the first part of the nine cantos of the epic describes the nine qualities of Parashurama and the second part of the 12 cantos as the hero of the epic, Veer and Sajjan Rama as the main female The characters are presented with Sita

 The story of the six cantos is the basic structure of the poet
 yah mahakavy 21 sargon main pranit he
 His study of Lord Shiva on Mount Kailash, the incarnation of Parashurama in the first nine cantos, the execution of his father's order to kill his mother and three brothers, and his subsequent resurrection, his war with Sahasrabahu king Sahasrarjuna, his earthly Kshatriya dynasty

 Shiva decides to impart all his knowledge to his disciple
 shiv parashuram se kehete hai ki ve unhen bhagwaan shriram kaa avatar samajhate hai, jo ki samast vidyaon main pehle se hi nishnaat hai, kintu sansar ke samaksh ek adarsh prastut karne ke liye guru ke yahan adhyayan kar rahe hai
 Parshuram's education begins

 The majority of the fourth canto is related to the description of Jamadagni's ashram in nature, especially the rainy season and the forest
 bhagwaan shiv parashuram ko apane mata-pita ke yahan lautne kii anumati de dete hai
 While Parashurama is leaving, Shiva asks Shriram Avatar Parashurama to forgive him if he disrespects him in any way by ordering him as Guru

 Parashurama respectfully rejects this request and says that he always wants to stay away from the shackles of householder life
 ek subah, renuka jal lene ke liye ek sarovar par jaati he
 There she sees Gandharvaraj Chitraratha along with his wife in the water of the lake
 renuka chitrarath ko dekhakar aakrisht ho jaati he or uske sambandh main kalpanaayen karti hui ghar lautati he
 Jamadagni realizes this and orders his three elder sons to kill their mother, who according to them has become impure by her adulterous thoughts
 jab teenon putr unke aadesh kaa paalan karne se manaa kar dete hai, to parashuram se jamadagni yah kaary karne ko kehete hai
 Parshuram gets upset about his father's orders and his mother's debt - choosing one of them
 unke maanas patal par smriti shaastra samaran ho uthte hai, jo udghoshnaa kar rahe hai ki mata pita se das guna adhik mahaan hoti he
 After much brainstorming, they decide to obey their father
 parashuram apni mata or teenon bhaaiyon ke sir pruthak kar dete hai
 Jamadagni, satisfied with Parashuram's obedience, asks him to ask for two boons
 parashuram pratham var main chaaron ke punarjjiwan kii maang karte hai or duusare var ke rup main un sabhi ko vadh kii vismriti ho jane kii yachana karte hai
 Pleased Jamadagni offers them both bridesmaids and Renuka and her three sons wake up as if asleep
 is prakaar parashuram apane pita ko santusht karte hai or apni mata ke praanon ko vaapis le aate hai
 6
 Sahasrarjunavadh: - Parashuram starts teaching the Vedas
 ve brahmanon kii ek goshtee kaa aayojan karte hai, jisamen ve brahmanon ke hetu aprihaary gunon ke sambandh main vivechan karte hai or unase apane kartavyon kaa kadaapi ulanghan na karne ko kehete hai
 After this, he goes to a deserted forest to do penance
 sahatrarjun jamadagni rishi ke ashram par aata he, jabaki parashuram yahan se dur gaye hue hai
 Jamadagni welcomes him and his army through the services of Kamadhenu Gau
 sahatrarjun jamadagni se kamdhenu use dene kaa aagrah karata he or kahata he ki raja kaa apni praja kii samast sampatti par adhikaar hota he
 When Jamadagni refuses his request, Sahasrarjuna takes Kamadhenu by force to his capital Mahishmati
 parashuram jab lautate hai to yah samachar jaanakar krodhit ho uthte hai or akele hi kamdhenu ko vaapis laane ke liye mahishmati chal padate hai
 Upon reaching Mahishmati, he challenges Sahasrarjuna to battle, which Sahasrarjun accepts
 parashuram yuddh main sahatrarjun kii sari sena kaa sanhaar kar dete hai
 After this a fierce battle ensues between Parashurama and Sahasrarjuna, in which both use divine arrows
 tab parashuram nishchay karte hai ki unhone sahatrarjun ko yuddh ke rangamanch par bahut der manoranjan karne kaa avasar pradaan kar diya he
 Parshuram instantly holds his five hundred bows together
 phir ve sahatrarjun ke rath kaa vidhwans kar dete hai
 Sahasrarjuna then strikes a fight with Parashurama in a duel
 apane parashu kaa prayog sahatrarjun kaa sir kaatane ke liye karne se purv, parashuram uski samast bhujaaon ko apane parashu se kaat phenkate hai
 The deity praises Parashurama freely for destroying the terror of Sahasrarjuna
 parashuram vijayi hokar evam kamdhenu ko saath lekar apane ashram lautate hai or sabhi unka prasann hryday se swaagat karte hai
 7
 teerthatanam-jamadagni advises Parasurama to make a pilgrimage to various holy places in India for the comfort of his mind, aroused by the destruction of Sahasrarjuna
 parashuram sarvapratham chitrakoot, ayodhya, mathura, vrindavan, haridwar, mayapuri, kaashi, kanchi, ranganath, avantika or dwarika sthit vaishnav tirthasthalon kii yatra karte hai
 Thereafter, they visit Shaiva pilgrimage sites - Somnath, Mallikarjuna, Mahakal, Akareswar, Vaidyanath, Bhimashankar, Kashi Vishwanath, Trimbakeshwar, Kedarnath, Nageshwar, Rameshwar and Dwadash Jyotirlinga of Ghushmeshwar
 iske pashchaat ve pushkar kii tirthayatra karte hai
 Finally they reach Prayag and bathe in the Sangam
 sarg ke ant main kavi tipanni karte hai ki in samast sthanon kii yatra kar, parashuram bharat kii sampoorn bhoomi ko ek tirthasthal bana dete hai
 8
 Nyastadandam — While Parashurama is on his pilgrimage, the son of Sahasrarjuna — the Haihaya prince invades the ashram of Jamadagni to avenge his father's slaughter
 rajkumaar prayek vastu or vyakti jo unke raste main aata he, ko nasht kar dete hai
 In deep meditation, they cut the head of Magad Jamdagni and take it with him to Mahishmati
 jab parashuram lautate hai to ve ashram ko shavon se aachhadit pate hai
 That is when he is seen craning Renuka Karun near Jamadagni's torso
 parashuram ko dekhakar renuka 21 baar apni chaati petakar vilaap karti hui kahati he ki parashuram ke abhi tak jivit rahete hue haihay raajaaon ne unke pati ko kaise maar daalaa? Parashurama puts Jamadagni's torso in a boat filled with oil and asks Renuka to protect the father's body until he returns
 cruddh parashuram akele hi mahishmati jate hai or haihayon ko lalkaarte hai
 They destroy their entire army and completely destroy the Haihaya dynasty
 phir ve jamadagni ke kate sheesh ko laakar dhad se jod dete hai, jisase jamadagni punerjeevit ho uthte hai
 Except Raghu and Yadu dynasty, Parashurama kills the Kshatriya caste 21 times from the earth
 parashuram 12000 raajaaon kaa vadh kar kurukshetra main rakt ke paanch vishaal kund bana dete hai
 Finally, at the behest of Kashyapa Rishi, Parashurama renounces his anger and gives the entire conquered land to Kashyapa
 tatpashchaat ve tapascharya karne ke liye mahendra parvat par chale jate hai
 9
 Ekadantanashanam - Parashurama on the Mahendra mountain meditates on the auspicious form of Lord Shiva and decides that his shadow will be able to attain peace only after seeing Shiva
 jab parashuram kailash pahonchte hai, to pravesh dwaar par unhen shiv putr ganesh milte hai
 Ganesh asks Parasurama to wait as Shiva is still engrossed in the evening evening rituals
 parashuram krodhit ho jate hai or apane parakram evam parashu kaa bakhaan karne lagate hai
 Ganesha starts laughing at his ransom, which was used to slaughter his own mother and Kshatriya babies
 parashuram or bhi adhik kupit ho jate hai or bal prayog kar andar jane kaa prayaas karne lagate hai, kintu gajanan ganesh unhen apni sund se peeche phenk dete hai
 Parshuram tries to harm Ganesh by throwing his ransom, which breaks Ganesh's left tooth
 shiv ke bhoot parashuram ko maarane ke liye un par akraman kar dete hai, kintu ganesh unhen roak dete hai
 Then Goddess Parvati comes and scolds Parashurama for breaking the teeth of his guru-son
 vah kupit hokar parashuram ko shraap detii hai ki unka parashu ram main usee prakaar tirohit ho jayega, jis prakaar bijli badalon main anternihit ho jaati he or unke dhanush baan unke praanon ke saath ram main samahit ho jaaenge
 She then says that Ekadanta Ganesh, who controlled himself without taking revenge for breaking his teeth, will be worshiped everywhere
 parashuram parvati ko prasann karte hai or ganesh se kshamaa-yachana karte hai
 After that, they greet Lord Shiva and return to his ashram
 10
 shriraghavavatarpratigyanam-parashuram mahendra parvat par laut aate hai or apane gat kaary kalapon kaa vishleshan karte hai
 They feel great remorse over what they have done in their anger and resolve to do penance to atone for all the slaughter in their past
 ve bhagwaan shriram ke sundar rup kaa dhyaan karne lagate hai
 After Sahasrarjuna is killed and Parashurama renounces his weapons, there is no longer any shurma in the world challenging Ravana's power
 atev vah sampoorn dharaa ko traas dene lagata he- vah kailash parvat uthaa letaa he, aathon diggajon ko sataane lagata he, indra kaa rajya jeet letaa he or dharmacharan karne vaale prayek vyakti ko aatankit karne lagata he
 Unable to bear Ravana's atrocities, Prithvi assumes the form of a cow and rushes to the Sumeru mountain
 brahma prithvi evam shiv ke sang vaartalap karte hai
 After that Brahma goes to Saketalok to see Lord Sitaram Ji
 vah ravan sanhaar hetu bhagwaan shriram se avatar lene kii prarthana karte hue unki 31 padyon main atyant sundar stuti karte hai
 Shriram assures him that he will soon incarnate as Rama and along with his three Vishnu parts - Vishnu as Kshirasagar, Vishnu as Bharata, Vaikuntha as Vishnu as Lakshman, and Vishnu as Shatrughna from Svetadvip
 jab brahma aashwast hokar laut jate hai, ram sita se swayan avatar lene ke pashchaat unase bhi avatarit hone kaa nivedan karte hai
 He then decides to be born as the son of Kaushalya in Ayodhya
 11
 shriraghavavataranam- sarg ke pratham pandrah shloke sarayu nadi ke tat par sthit ayodhya nagari ke gaurav kaa gun-gaan karte hai
 Maharaj Dasaratha is ruling the kingdom of Ayodhya, but even after many years he has not had a son
 ve apane guru vashishtha ke sameep jate hai or unke samaksh apane hryday kii apurna abhilaashaa vyakt karte hai
 Vashistha assures them to have four sons born soon
 ashwamedh, vishvajit or rajasuya yajna ko sampann karne ke pashchaat, vashishtha dasharath ke liye putreshti yajna karaane ke liye rishi rishyashrung ko aamantrit karte hai
 At the end of the yagna, Agnidev appears with a character of Kheer
 dasharath kheer kaa aadha bhaag kaushalya ko dete hai, chauthai kaikeyi ko evam do aathven bhaag sumitra ko
 All three queens become pregnant
 isi bich anek devtaa vanar pariwaron main avatarit hote hai, jinamein shiv hanuman ke rup main janm lete hai
 Twelve months after the queens conceived, on the auspicious day of Chaitra Shukla Paksha Navami, Lord Shri Ram appears as a hexagonal teenager wearing a bow and arrow
 kaushalya kii vinati par ve ek sadyojaat shishu kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 Kaikeyi gives birth to Bharata and Sumitra two sons - Lakshmana and Shatrughna
 devgan or ayodhya kii praja chaaron putron ke janm par anand se utsav karte hai
 Parashurama is thrilled by the meditation of the hair form of Lord Rama on Mahendra mountain and praising him in 16 verses
 12
 shrimaithilyvataranam-jab dasharath ke chaaron putr chathe varsh main pravesh karte hai, unka upanayan sanskaar sampann hota he
 King Sheeradhwaj Janaka, a disciple of the sage Yajnavalkya, is handling his Mithila kingdom like a yogi
 punerany main apni patni rani sunayana ke sang somyag yajna karte hue, jab raja janak swarna ke ek hal se baishakh shukla paksh navami ko bhoomi jotate hai, sahasaa prithvi fat jaati he or swarna singhaasana par asin or apni aath sakhiyon se pariveshtit bhagwati jagatjanani sita shodashavarshiya kishori ke rup main prithvi se prakat ho jaati hai
 An Akashwani proclaims Sita to Janaka's daughter
 naarad muni mithila main padhaarte hai or sita kii 16 padyon main stuti karte hai
 Thereafter Narada begs Sita to assume the form of an infant
 janak or sunayana shishu sita ko apane mahal main le aate hai or apni putree kii bhaanti unka laalan-paalan karte hai
 Once, Sita goes to the eastern part of Janak's capital and asks Father Janak about a bow being worshiped
 raja janak unhen bataate hai ki yah bhagwaan shiv dwaara swayan unke purvaj devraat ko pradutt pinaak naamak shiv-dhanush he
 Sita tells father Janak that the antiquities are throwable rather than worshiped, and dragging the heavy bow over and over again, making a horse in the game
 janak ke anurodh par, sita us dhanush ko- jise uthaane main manushya evam devtaa bhi asamarth the-uske sthaan par vaapis rakh detii hai
 Parashuram is mesmerized after seeing this scene in his tomb on the Mahendra mountain and walks towards Mithila with a desire to see the image of teenager Sita
 13
 shribhargavamithilaagamanam-apni chah varsh kii vay main bhi, sita kii akruti ek shodashavarshiya kishori kii bhaanti he
 His unique beauty has been described by Mahakavi in 12 verses
 janak ko pratiti ho gai he ki unki kanya saadhaaran balika hone ke sthaan par bhagwaan shri ram kii aadi shakti he, kyonki vah ek shishu hote hue bhi shiv ke baari dhanush ko uthaane main sakasham he
 He worries to find a suitable groom for Sita
 veda kii richaon main avatharavaad ke siddhanth kaa shravan karne ke pashchaat, vah is sambandh main chintan kar rahe hai, kintu unka gyaan or taarkikta unhen is par vishwaas nahin karne dete
 After much brainstorming, he comes to the conclusion that this principle must be true
 usee samay dwarpal mithila main parashuram ke aagaman kii ghoshnaa karata he
 King Janaka salutes Parashurama
 janak ko ek sadaachari raja samajhate hue, parashuram unhen nirankush kshatriyon ke samaan apane shatru ke rup main nahin dekhte hai
 Parashurama expresses his desire to see Sita in front of him
 janak unhen yajyashala main le jate hai, jahaan parashuram shiv dhanush ko khel kaa ghoda banaakar ghaseetati huin or usase krida karti huin bhagwati sita ke darshan karte hai
 Parashurama asks Janaka to organize Sita Swayamvara, in which only a prince capable of breaking the Siva bow is eligible for Sita's accession
 tadnantar parashuram bhavishyavaanee karte hai ki raghu ke vanshaj shriram hi dhanush kaa bhanjan karenge
 Parashurama tells Janaka that he will come back again in Mithila acting as an enrage so that he can get an excuse to see both Sita and Rama
 sarg ke ant main parashuram shishu sita ko pranaam karte hai or unki prashansa kaa gaan karne lagate hai
 14
 srisitastavanam - This entire canto is eulogistic
 parashuram sita kaa stutigaan 99 padyon main karte hai
 After this, they greet the supreme peace and after bowing to Sita, they leave for the happy Mahendra mountain
 15
 ahalyoddharanam-apane mantriyon evam daivagyon ke sang mantranaa karne ke uparant, janak sita swayamvar kaa din sunishchit karte hai
 Meanwhile, in Ayodhya, King Dasharatha is concerned about the marriage of his son Rama
 rakshasi tadka muni vishwamitra ke yajna main baarambaar vighn daalati he
 Vishwamitra comes to the court of King Dasaratha and begs Rama and Lakshmana to protect his yagna from the demons
 ram dwaara unhen chhodkar jane ke vichaar par, dasharath hichkichaate hai or swayan ko nashtpraay samajhate hai, kintu guru vashishtha unhen ram or lakshmana ko bhejne ke liye manaate hai
 Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to his forest, where Rama kills Tadka, when she rains trees and rocks and attacks all three
 vishwamitra ram evam lakshmana ko bhalaa or atibala naamak do vidyaayein pradaan karte hai, jo unhen kuch khaae, pie or soe bina bhi jeevandhaaran karaane main sakasham hai
 Vishwamitra also surrenders all his divya to Rama
 ram or lakshmana vishwamitra ke yajna kii chah diwas or chah raatri nirantar raksha karte hai
 On the seventh day, the demons Bhai Marich and Subahu attack the Yagna with a huge army
 ram marich ko sagar ke paar phenkane ke liye manvaastra kaa prayog karte hai, jabaki aagneyastra kaa sandhan kar, ve subahu kaa sanhaar kar dete hai
 Meanwhile, Laxman destroys the entire army of demons
 vishwamitra rakshason ke bhay se mukt ho jate hai or ram evam lakshmana ko sita swayamvar hetu mithila le jane kaa nishchay karte hai
 On the way, Rama sees Ahalya, cursed by her husband Gautama, for her adulterous act and transformed into Shila
 vishwamitra ram ko ahilya ke itihaas kii katha sunaate hai
 Rama touches Ahalya with her feet and Ahalya is freed from her curse and sin
 ahilya ashrupurit nayanon se ram kii vandana karti he or gautam ke nivasasthal kii ore prasthaan karti he
 16
 sriraghavapriyadarshanam-vishwamitra, arrives in Mithila with Rama and Lakshmana
 shriram mithila nagari main pahunchne par harshollasit hai, kintu anya raja, jo sita swayamvar hetu aae hue hai, ram ke aagaman se prasann nahin hai
 The citizens of Mithila are happy to see Ram
 jab raja janak vishwamitra se donon rajkumaron ke sambandh main jigyaasa prakat karte hai, vishwamitra ram evam lakshmana kaa janak se parichay karaate hai
 Janaka brings both the princes to his palace and welcomes them
 iske pashchaat lakshmana ram ke samaksh mithila nagari ko dekhne kii ichha prakat karte hai or ram guru kii ajna praapt kar unke sang chal padate hai
 The children of Mithila take Rama and Lakshmana around the city and in the end embrace Ram's happiness
 duusare din badi bhor main ram evam lakshmana vishwamitra kii puja hetu pushp chayan karne ke liye janak ke rajkeey udyaan main pravesh karte hai
 a day before Swayamvara, Sita also visits Gauri for worship in the same garden
 sita evam ram ek duusare kaa pratham baar darshan karte hai, jab ve udyaan main sahasaa aamane-saamne aa jate hai
 Rama tells Laxman about his attraction to Sita
 ve lakshmana se kehete hai ki sita avashya hi bhavishya main unki patni hongi kyonki unke man ne swapn main bhi kabhi parastri kii kaamana nahin kii he
 Laxman then salutes Sita as her sister-in-law
 udhar sita apane hrydaymandir main shriram kii sundar chhavi sanjokar uski aradhana karne lagati hai or gauri pujan ke pashchaat apane mahal ko laut aati hai
 Shriram and Lakshmana return near Vishwamitra and offer them with flowers from Janaka's state garden
 shriram vishwamitra ko apane hryday main sita ke prati utpann aakarshan ke sambandh main sab kuch bataa dete hai
 Vishwamitra is pleased with Rama's innocence and blesses him and goes to sleep
 aaj ram raatri main bhi jage hue hai, ve chandramaa ke soundarya kii prashansa kar rahe hai, jo unhen baarambaar sita ke mukhachandra kaa madhur samaran kara rahaa he
 17
 sitasvayanvaram - Next morning Shriram and Lakshman wake up and bow to Vishwamitra
 teenon sita swayamvar main ek saath padhaarte hai
 Children, young and old, and the newly weds of Mithila get delighted by seeing the beautiful appearance of Shri Ram
 raja janak ram ko dekhakar man hi man prarthana karte hai ki vah hi shiv dhanush kaa bhanjan karen
 Twelve different groups of people present in the meeting of Sita Swayamvar look at Rama with the vision of different twelve expressions
 mithila ke chaaran raja janak ke pran kii udghoshnaa karte hai ki shiv dhanush pinaak par pratyancha chadhaane vaala rajkumaar hi sita ke panigrahan kaa adhikari hoga
 Banasura, Ravana and many kings present in the meeting try to lift the bow but fail
 tab das sahasr raja ek saath dhanush ko uthaane kaa prayaas karte hai, kintu samarth nahin ho pate
 Disappointed, King Janaka asks all the kings to return to their respective homes
 vah kehete hai ki yadi prithvi veeron se viheen ho chuki he, to vah sita ko kunwari rakhana pasand karenge
 Lakshman gets angry after hearing these words of Janaka in the assembly, but Shri Ram calms him with the hint of his eyes
 vishwamitra ram ko dhanush todane kii ajna dete hai
 Shriram lifts the bow like a trunk and immediately breaks it into two pieces
 vishwamitra dwaara vaidic mantron ke swarghosh ke madhya sita ram ko jaymaal pahanaati hai
 King Janaka praises Shriram, bowing to him
 18
 shribhargavalakshmanasamvadah-mahendra parvat par parashuram jaan jate hai ki bhagwaan ram ne mithila main pinaak tod diya he
 They also understand that some wicked king Shiva is planning to take Sita by force and imprison Rama and Lakshmana even after failing to lift the bow
 apane guru ke vachanon kaa samaran karte hue, parashuram apni antim lila ke bhaag main krodh kaa abhinay karte hue mithila kii sabha main aate hai
 Their presence terrorizes all the Kshatriya kings who are sitting in the assembly and they all become silent
 janak parashuram ko pranaam karte hai or sita se bhi unhen pranaam karaate hai
 Parashurama demonstrates ignorance and asks Janaka to show the culprit who broke his master's bow
 ram sasamman parashuram se kehete hai ki dhanush ko todane vaala unka hi koi das hoga or unki sharnagati kii yachana karte hai
 Parashurama asks Rama to behave like a slave and follow his order to separate his criminal from the mob
 parashuram ko ram kaa apmaan karte dekhakar lakshmana turant cruddh ho uthte hai or parashuram kii hansee udaate hue unhen pratyuttar dete hai
 a speech war ensues between the two, in which Lakshmana responds to Parshuram's threats with intelligent sarcasm
 jab lakshmana parashuram kaa uphaas karte hue unki samast dhamkiyon kii baarambaar pratyaalochana karte hai, to parashuram kupit hokar apana parashu uthaa lete hai or lakshmana ko maarane ke liye aage badhate hai
 At the same time, Shriram starts speaking to calm Parashurama
 19
 shriraghave bhargavapraveshah-shriram parashuram ke krodh kaa apane vinamr vachanon se nivaaran karte hai
 Rama admits that he broke the bow only when ordered by Vishwamitra
 ve parashuram ko apana guru kehete hai or swayan ko unka shishy
 Rama apologizes to Parashurama for Laxman's derogatory words
 jab ram is prakaar bol rahe hote hai, lakshmana usee samay parashuram kii ore dekhakar punah muskuraane lagate hai
 This causes Parshuram to become enraged again and dare Rama to fight a duel, saying that he is not an ordinary Brahmin
 ram parashuram se sadar nivedan karte hue kehete hai ki dwand yuddh keval samakakshon ke madhya hota he or vah parashuram ke sang dwandv yuddh karne ke yogya nahin hai
 He tells Parasurama that he is omnipotent but still a slave to Brahmins
 tatpashchaat shriram parashuram ke samaksh apane mahavishnu rup ko prakat karte hai or apane vaksh:sthal par bhrigu ke charan chihn ke darshan karaate hai
 Parashurama abandons the act of anger upon seeing his ancestor's footprints
 ve shriram se shaarg naamak vishnu dhanush par pratyancha chadhaane ke liye kehete hai
 As soon as they hand over the bow to Rama, their ax is dissolved and all their weapons go and merge into Rama
 unki abha bhi shriram main pravisht ho jaati he
 Ram fixes the cross on the Vaishnav bow and puts an arrow on it
 parashuram kaa andeh yukt abhinay bhi samaapt ho jaataa he
 Parashurama then praises Rama in twelve beautiful shlokas
 shriram parashuram se kehete hai ki unka baan amogh he
 They ask Parashurama to use this arrow to destroy Parashurama's power to roam free on the earth or to destroy the fruits earned by Parashurama from penance
 shriram parashuram ke samaksh punah apane mahavishnu rup ko prakat karte hai or taduparant parashuram kii aajnaaon kaa swaagat karte hue unke charnon main gir padate hai
 In the midst of the complimentary outings of all the people in the assembly, Paraुरurāma asks Rāma to rise from his feet and embrace him
 phir ve ram se vicharan shakti ke sthaan par apane tap se praapt falon ko nasht karne ko kehete hai
 Sri Ram does the same
 parashuram un kii stuti karne lagate hai
 20
 Sribhargavakritaraghavastavanam - This entire canto is eulogistic
 parashuram ram kii sau padyon main stuti karte hai
 Concluding the eulogy, Parashuram begs him to protect him, pleading with Sita and Rama to always dwell in his heart and confess his ignorance and Rama's omniscience
 tatpashchaat ve apane avatar kaa samaapan karte hai, anand kaa aswadan karte hai or ram kii prashasti karke prasthaan karte hai

 Yamaka ornamentation is an ornament in Sanskrit and Prakrit language, in which the same word is used more than once, but each word has its own special meaning
 mahakavy ke tisare sarg se uddhrut nimnlikhit padya main chaar charan hai, kintu ek hi akshar se chaar vibhinn arthon kaa taatpary nikalataa he, jinamein se ek-ek arth kii prayek charan ke liye kavi ne sundar sanyojna kii he
 In this way, the use of the quadrant Yamaka used in the whole poem is also called Mahayamaka

 Two consecutive nights, with the intention of fulfilling his wife's wish, the husband stormed into the garden and brought her secretly, but the third night as he was climbing the wall to return home, he was called "dame Gothel"
 The sorceress caught her and accused her of stealing
 She begged for mercy, she agreed to be old, but on the condition that he would hand over the unborn child to her after birth
 laachaar pati sahamat ho gaya
 When the daughter was born, the sorceress took her and raised her as a parent, naming her Rapunzel
 jab rapanzel kii umr baarah saal kii thi, jaaduugarani ne use sabaki nazaron se dur jangal ke bich ek aisi minar main band kar diya, jis par chadhane ke liye na to seedhiyaan thim or naa hi andar ghusane ke liye koi daravaaza, usamen tha to sirf ek cameraa or ek khidki
 jab jaaduugarani rapanzel se milane jaati thi, to vah minar ke neeche khadi ho jaati thi or use yah kah kar bulaati thi: Upon hearing these words, Rapunzel wrapped her long, golden hair with a peg hanging next to the window and hung them down near the enchantress, who climbed into the minaret room near Rapunzel

 One day, a prince riding a horse was passing through the forest and he heard Rapunzel singing in the tower
 Fascinated by her supernatural voice, he sets out to find the young woman and finds the tower, but is unable to enter it
 baad main vah aksar vahaan aane laga, uskaa madhur gayan sunne laga or ek din usne dame gothel ko vahaan par dekha or is prakaar rapanzel tak pahunch hasil karne kaa tareeqa jaan gaya
 When Dame moved to Gothel, she requested Rapunzel to hang her hair down
 jab usne aisa kiya, to vah chadh kar upar pahunch gaya, usase parichay badhaayaa or ant main uske saamne vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Rapunzel agreed to it
 donon ne saath mil kar bhaagane kii yojana banaai, jiske anusaar vah har raat usase milegaa or uske liye resham le aayega, jinase rapanzel dhire-dhire seedhi bunegi

 jab us raat rajkumaar vahaan pahunch kar use pukaarata he, to jaaduugarani use upar chadhaane ke liye kati hui chotii ko neeche lataka detii he
 The Prince is horrified to find the sorceress in front of Rapunzel
 jab vah gusse main usase kahati he ki vah phir kabhi rapanzel se nahin mil paaegaa, vah minar se kud padataa he or neeche bichhe kaanton se andhaa ho jaataa he
 In another version, the sorceress pushes him and he falls on the thorns, leaving him blind

 One day, when Rapunzel sings a song filled with water, the prince recites Rapunzel's voice and the two meet
 jab ve ek duusare kii bahon main lipatate hai, to rapanzel ke aansuon se rajkumaar kii drushti use waapas mil jaati he
 In another passage, it is said that Rapunzel eventually gave birth to two children
 rajkumaar use apane rajya le jaataa he, jahaan ve khushi se jivan bitaate hai
 In another adaptation of the story, the finale is told that the prince opens Rapunzel's braid after the prince's jump from the minaret, but it slips from his hands and falls under the minaret

 The original story comes from Rudaba in an ancient Iranian book called Shahnama written by Firdausi around 1000 BC

 Another influence on Grimm's Rapunzel was Petrosinella or Parsley, a 1634 narrative collection Lo Cunto de le Kunti or "pentamerone" written by Giambattista Basil
 In it, one such pregnant woman wishes to eat some parsley from a cannibal monster's garden, is caught and promises to give her child to the cannibal monster

 Yashpal's name is prominent among the writers of modern Hindi literature
 ye ek saath hi krantikari evam lekhak donon roopon main jane jate he
 After Premchand, he is named among the well-known progressive storytellers of Hindi
 apane vidhyaarthee jivan se hi yashpal krantikari aandolan se jude, iske parinamswarup lambi faraari or jail main vyateet karnaa padaa
 After this, he made literature his life, the work which he had done through gun, now he started the work of public awareness through bulletin
 yashpal ko sahitya evam shiksha ke kshetra main bharat sarkaar dwaara san 1970 main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Yashpal was born in an ordinary Khatri family on 3 December 1903 in Ferozepur Cantonment, Punjab
 unki maan shrimati premdevi vahaan anathalay ke ek skool main adhyapika thim
 Yashpal's father Harilal was an ordinary businessman
 unka paitruk gaanv ranghad tha, jahaan kabhi unke purvaj hamirpur se aakar bas gaye the
 Father had a small shop and it was because of his business that people used to call him 'lala'
 bich-bich main ve ghode par saamaan ladakar pheri ke liye aas-paas ke gaanvon main bhi jate the
 He used to raise a small amount of money he had collected from his business, without any strong written and educated hand, borrowed on interest
 apane parivaar ke prati unka dhyaan nahin tha
 That is why Yashpal's mother, with her two sons - Yashpal and Dharmapala - was much more aware of her children's education while teaching in a school of Arya Samaj in Ferozepur Cantonment
 yashpal ke vikaas main garibi ke prati tikhi ghrinaa arya samaaj or swadhinata andolan ke prati upje aakarshan ke mul main unki maan or is parivesh kii ek nirnaayak bhoomika rahi he
 Poverty suffered in Yashpal's creative development had a distinctive role in his childhood
 apane bachapan main yashpal ne angrezon ke aatank or vicitra vyavhaar kii anek kahaniyaan suni thim
 No Indian could pass an umbrella in front of the British to avoid rain or sunlight
 bade shaharon or pahaado par mukhya sadaken unheen ke liye thim, hindustani in sadakon ke neeche bani kachi sadak par chalate the
 Yashpal heard these things only in his senses, not seen, because by then the sparks of the revolutionary movement, which had denied the sovereignty of the British, were bursting in place
 lekin phir bhi apane bachapan main yashpal ne jo bhi kuch dekha, vah angrezon ke prati ghrinaa bhar dene ko kaafii tha
 He writes, "I have seen the British taking salute from all the common people on the road
 hindustaniyon ko unke saamne gidgidaate dekha he, isse apana apmaan anumaan kiya he or uske prati virodh anubhav kiya
 

 ' angrezon or prakarantar se british samrajyavad ke viruddh apni ghrinaa ke sandarbh main yashpal apane bachapan kii do ghatnaon kaa ullekh vishesh rup se karte hai
 The first of these incidents is of four-five years of age
 tab unke ek sambandhi yuktpraant ke kisi qasbe main kapaas otane ke kaarakaane main manager the
 There were two to four bungalows of the British working near the factory station
 aas-paas hi in logon kaa khub aatank tha
 Chickens were raised in one of these bungalows, which roamed on the nearby road
 ek shaam yashpal un murgiyon se chhedhkhani karne lage
 Mam Sahiba, who lives in Bengali, reprimanded the children for this act
 shaayad ‘gadhaa’ yaa ‘ullu’ jaisi koi gaali bhi di
 Yashpal, a child of four or five years, also responded to his abuses with abuse
 jab us stri ne unhen maarane kii dhamkee di, to unhone bhi use vaise hi dhamkaate hue jawaab diya or phir bhagkar kaarakaane main chhip gaye
 But the incident could not be taken lightly
 isaki shikaayat unke sambandhi se kii gai
 He complained to Yashpal's mother, and amidst many apprehensions and terror, he also told about the crisis that could befall the people of the whole factory
 phir iske parinaam kaa ullekh karte hue yashpal likhte hai, ‘meri maan ne ek chadi lekar mujhe koob peeta main zamin par lot-pot gaya parantu pitayee jari rahi
 It is not difficult to imagine how my feelings towards the British must have arisen as a result of this incident
 


’ The second incident is a little later
 tab yashpal kii maan yuktpraant main hi nainital zile main tirai ke qasbe kashipur main arya kanya paathshaala main mukhyadhyapika thim
 Relatively far away from the city, the relative had got a lot of accommodation due to his work and Yashpal's mother also lived there
 ghar ke paas hi ‘dron sagar’ naamak ek talab tha
 The women of the house often went for a walk there in the afternoon
 ek din ve striyaan vahaan naha rahi thim ki uske duusari ore do angrez shaayad faujee gore, achaanak dikhaai die
 Seeing them, women started screaming in fear and clinging to each other in self-defense, in fear, they took off their clothes and started running away
 yashpal bhi unke saath bhaage
 Nothing special happened but the scene of running away from the British in such a manner was permanently stung in their memory
 

‘angrez se vah bhay aisa hi tha jaise bakriyon ke jhund ko baagh dekh lene se bhay lagata hoga arthath angrez kuch bhi kar saktaa tha
 There was no other way than to cry and scream with fear from him
 

’ The Arya Samaj and the Congress were the stops which Yashpal eventually came to the revolutionary organization
 unki maan unhen swami dayanand ke aadarshon kaa ek tejasvi prachaarak bananaa chaahati thim
 For this purpose, he got his initial education in Gurukul Kangri
 arya samaji daman ke viruddh ugr pratikriya ke beej unke man kii dharti par yaheen pade
 It was here that he got an opportunity to closely observe the revivalist tendencies
 apni nirdhantaa kaa kachot-bharaa anubhav bhi unhen yaheen hua
 Even in his childhood, he does not think of himself as responsible for the crime of being poor
 inhen sanskaron ke kaaran ve garib ke apmaan ke prati kabhi udasin nahin ho sake
 Congress was Yashpal's second stage
 apane daur ke anek duusare logon kii tarah ve bhi congress ke madhyam se hi raajnneeti main aae
 From the political point of view Firozpur Cantt was a peaceful place
 chhavnee se teen mile dur shahar ke lacture or jalse hote rahete the
 Even khadi used to be propagated

 Khaddar kurta-pajama and Gandhi used to wear hats made from household slugs
 isi khaddar kaa ek kot bhi unhone banwaaya tha
 Tired of getting muddy again and again, they had him red colored

 The cause of Yashpal's immediate disenchantment with Mahatma Gandhi and Gandhism may have been announced on 12 February 22, after the chaura-chauri scandal by Mahatma Gandhi, but it had begun earlier
 yashpal or unke krantikari saathiyon kaa sashastr kranti kaa jo agenda tha, gandhi kaa ahimsa kaa siddhant uske virodh main jaataa tha
 He found the mixing of religion and politics by Mahatma Gandhi to be fundamentally wrong
 metric ke baad lahore aane par yashpal neshnal college main bhagatsingh, sukhdev or bhagwaticharan bohara ke sampark main aae
 His extensive and active participation in the activities of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha was in fact an inevitable result of his disenchantment with Gandhi and Gandhism
 noujvaan bharat sabha ke mukhya sutradhaar bhagwaticharan or bhagat singh the
 While commenting on the possible goals, Yashpal writes, 'the program of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha is to inspire the public by criticizing the compromise policy of the Gandhian Congress and to point out a fundamental difference between the revolutionaries and Mahatma Gandhi and the Gandhians in the masses
 Will be useful lala lajpatraay kii hinduvadi nitiyon se ghor virodh ke baavjood unpar hue lathi charge ke kaaran, jisase hi antat unki mrityu hui, bhagatsingh or unke saathiyon ne sanders kii hatya kii
 He saw this incident as a national insult whose resistance needed to be forgotten
 bhagatsingh dwaara asembli main bam-cond isi soch kii ek taarkik parinti thi, lekin bhagatsingh, sukhdev or raajaguru kii phaansi ke virodh main mahatma gandhi ne janata kii ore se vyapak dabaav ke baavjood, koi aupchaarik apil tak jari nahin kii
 In the memoirs of his revolutionary life, which Yashpal wrote in an overview, he evaluated that movement and his colleagues in his vision
 taarkikta, vaastaviktaa or vishwasaneeyata par unhone hameshaa jor diya he
 It is possible that many may disagree with that assessment or Yashpal is accused of distorting the facts
 aaj bhi kuch log aise hai, jo yashpal ko bahut acha krantikari nahin maanate
 In the context of his revolutionary life, he carries the character of his characterization as completely true and perhaps that is why he considers my constant and frequent return to Yashpal as something like a 'sand idol'
 ‘kranti’ ko bhi ve bam-pistaulavaali raajnneeti kranti tak hi simit karke dekhte hai
 The political revolution was a part of the revolutionary change in the social system for Yashpal
 samrajyavad ko ve ek shoshankari vyavastha ke rup main dekhte the, jo bhagatsingh ke shabdon main, ‘manushya ke haathon manushya ke or raashtra ke haathon raashtra ke shoshan kaa charam rup he’

 In the form of independence in the country and like many, they too were not satisfied

 And it was almost like Premchand had once expressed his apprehension as sitting on the throne to Govind instead of John
 krantikari rashtra bhakthi or balidaan kii bhaavana se prerit-sanchalit yuvak the
 He always attested this by sacrificing the occasion
 lekin yashpal apane saathiyon ko irshyaa-dwesh, spardhaa-aakankshawale saadhaaran manushyon ke rup main dekhe jane par bal dete hai
 In his memoirs, Rajendra Yadav today declares the ideal - 'he is not a deity' - he begins in Hindi with exactly these memoirs of Yashpal
 ye krantikari saamaanya manushyon se kuch alag, visisth or apane lakshyon ke liye ekantik rup se samarpit hone par bhi saamaanya maanviya anubhutiyon se achoote nahin the
 Could have happened
 sharathchandra ne patheradavi main krantikariyon kaa jo adarsh rup prastut kiya, yashpal use avastavik maanate the, jisase rashtrabhakti kii prerana milti ho, use krantikari andolan or us jivan ko vaastaviktaa kaa ek pratinidhi or pramanik chitra nahin mana ja saktaa
 Subodhchandra Sen sees the disintegration of Savyasachi as a metaphor for the exodus of future magnate Subhash Chandra Bose on the electric storm waterfall night at Gupta Pathredawi, while Yashpal sees the real life of Sabyasachi's superhuman activities and life spent in lair-ruins And not considered authentic
 krantikari jivan ke apane lambey anubhavon ko hi ve apni is aalochana ke mukhya aadhaar ke rup main istemaal karte hai
 2, after his release from prison on March 38, when Yashpal started publishing and editing Viplav in November the same year, he defined his work as 'bullet Bulletin'
 jis ahimsak or samtamulak samaaj kaa nirmaan ve raajnneetik krantikari ke madhyam se karnaa chaahate the, usee adhure kaam ko aage badhaane ke liye unhone lekhan ko apana aadhaar banaaya
 Literature written at the center of the socio-political problems of its time is often always called as ideological
 nand dulaare vaajapeyi kaa premchand ke viruddh bada aarope yahi tha
 Yashpal answered almost the same as Premchand to the charge of propaganda
 apane pehle upanyaas dada commered kii bhoomika main unhone likhaa, ‘kala ke premiyon ko ek shikaayat mere prati he ki kala ko gaun or prachaar ko pramukh sthaan detaa hoon
 i do not have to appeal against this decision given to me

 apane lekhkeey sarokaaron par or vistaar se tippanee karte hue baad main unhone likhaa, ‘manushya ke purna vikaas or mukti ke liye sangharsh karnaa hi lekhak kii sarthakata he
 When the author shows contradiction in the old system and ideas for the liberation of man through his art and puts forth new ideals, then he is accused of being idealless and materialistic
 aaj ke lekhak kii jaden vaastaviktaa main hai, isliye vah bhautikwaadi to he hi parantu vah adarshaheen bhi nahin he
 His inspiration is more real
 aaj kaa lekhak jab apni kala dwaara nae aadarshon kaa samarthan karata he to us par prachaarak hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya jaataa he
 The writer always creates sympathy or opposition to an idea or ideal through his art
 sahitya vichaarpurn hoga
 The major genre of Yashpal's writing is novel, but he started his writing with stories
 unki kahaniyaan apane samay kii raajnneeti se us rup main aakraant nahin hai, jaise unke upanyaas
 In the era of the new story, against the artificial division of the body and mind of the woman, the image of an entire woman, which was emphasized, begins with Yashpal
 aaj kii kahani ke soch kii jo disha he, usamen yashpal kii kitni hi kahaniyaan bataur khaad istemaal hui he
 Their significance is unambiguous in terms of the possibilities of the present and the future story-scenario
 unke kahani-sangrahon main pinjre kii udaan, gyandaan, bhasmavrutt chinagaari, phulon kaa kurta, dharmayuddh, tumne kyon kaha tha main sundar hoon or uttami kii maan pramukh hai
 The map of what Yashpal had come from active politics to literature to create a world was very clear from the beginning
 unhone kisi yutapia kii jagah vyavastha kii vaastavik uplabdhiyon ko hi apana aadhaar banaaya tha
 In Yashpal's ideological journey, this sutra appears active from beginning to end, that the broad cooperation and active participation of the people are the main factors in the formation and development of a nation
 yashpal har jagah janata ke vyapak hiton ke samarthak or sangrakshak lekhak hai
 When Yashpal defines his journalism and writing as 'bulletin instead of bullet', in a way, he is commenting on his creative concerns
 aise durdharsh lekhak ke pratinidhi rachanakarm kaa yah sanchayan use sampoornataa main jaanane-samajhane ke liye prerit karegaa, aisa hamaara vishwaas he

 jis bhashaa ke sahityakar ko ek baar puraskaar mil jaataa he us par agle teen varsh tak vichaar nahin kiya jaataa he

 Purchase is a type of contract developed in the UK
 aajkal china bharat, japan, austrailia or newjiland main iskaa prachlan he
 It is also called closed-leasing
 jab koi kreta kisi sampatti kaa mulya ekamusth dene main asamarth hota he kintu us mulya kaa koi chota bhaag jamaa karne kii kshamta rakhata he us sthiti main kray-abhikray anubandh kaa upyog karke kreta us sampatti ko masik kiraaya ke badale udhaar le saktaa he
 In Canada and the USA it is called the 'installment plan'
 kray-abhikray-anubandh upanidhaan kii shrenee kaa anubandh mana gaya he
 There is no independent method to regulate purchasing
 at: anubandh kii sharton ke alaava sanvida vidhi ke hi niyam us par lagu hote hen
 According to the Bombay High Court, the practice of purchasing and procurement arose in England, and from there these types of contracts were also prevalent in India
 kray-abhikray kaa vidhigat arth he - kisi vastu kaa maalik apni vastu ko ek nishchit kiraye par uthaane ke saath-saath yah bhi vachan detaa he ki ukt vastu ko kiraye par lenevaale vyakti dwaara anubandh kii sharten puri kii jane par maalik us vastu ko bech degaa
 Similar to this, there is another way of buying and selling in which the buyer gets the facility to pay the entire value of the commodity in installments by not paying at the time of the sale
 ise ham vikray karne kaa anubandh kah sakate hai
 Despite the apparent equilibrium in these two types of commodity sales, there are four fundamental differences: kray-abhikray ke anubandh main vah vastu kiraye par lenevaale ke supurd turant kar di jaati he
 But it is not necessary to immediately deliver the item to the buyer from the sales contract
 kray-abhikray main vastu ko antat: kharidne yaa na kharidne kaa nirnay us vastu ko kiraye par lenevaale kii ichha par nirbhar hota he
 The question of will does not arise in the sale-contract, because the sale of the item has been edited in it, only the payment of the price continues
 kray-abhikray main yah vastu anubandh main nirdhaarit kalavadhi ke bheetar kisi samay bhi vastu ke maalik ke paas lautaai ja sakati he
 So naturally the responsibility of paying the rent of that item for the same time is on the agent
 vikray anubandh main yah prashn nahin uthta or vikreta sabhi kishton kii rakam vasuulne kaa adhikari hota he kyonki vastu vikray kaary sampadit ho chukaa hota he
 Although in the purchase agent, the item is handed over to the agent, the ownership of the item remains in the owner of the item until the agent reveals the decision to purchase the item
 lekin vikray anubandh main yadhyapi mulya kii adaayagi kishton main chalati rahati he tathaapi vikray kii hui vastu kaa swaamitv kreta main nihit ho chukaa hota he
 The effect of this difference is that in the sales contract, if the seller does not transfer the item to the buyer, the buyer can claim for the transfer of the item and if the buyer does not pay the installments, the seller can claim the value
 kintu abhikray main yadi kiraye kii kistein adaa nahin kii jaatin to vastu kaa maalik us vastu kii vaapasi or us samay tak ke kiraye kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 Normally, only two sides are required for purchase and purchase of the owner and agent of the object
 kintu is prakaar ke vyapaarik vinimay ke vistaar ke saath-saath vittiya sahaayak sanghathanon kaa bhi udai hua he jo ukt donon pakshon se sampark sthapit kar vastu ke maalik kaa sthaan uplabdh kar lete hai
 These types of commodity sales differ in the rights and responsibilities of the parties concerned, so the decision of the question of whether an agreement is a contract or a sale contract depends on the analysis of the terms of that agreement
 samjhaute kii sharton main vikray yaa abhikray utana mahatvapurn nahin he jitna yah dekhnaa ki donon pakshon kii asli manshaa kya he
 If there is no weight on the recipient of the item and it is left to his desire to become or not become the owner of the item, then it will be treated as an act despite the use of words like purchase, sale, installment etc
 kray-abhikray chunki anubandhsanvida kaa hi ek prakaar he at: naaballig vishyak sanvidavidhi ke niyam is par bhi lagu hote hai
 It is also noteworthy that purchasing agent can be used not only for movable property, but also for immovable property
