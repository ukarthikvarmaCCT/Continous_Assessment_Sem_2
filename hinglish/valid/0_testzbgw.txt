 One leaf is cut in a thread, the other is threaded and the threads are placed at the ends of the leaves in such a way that they fall in the same plane
 jab darsharekhi kshaitij patal par rakhaa ho to zairi or dhaagaa patal ke tal par lamb honge
 If any distant point or object is cut from the thread by peeping from the wrinkle, then the viewer will tell the direction of that point or object from the position of the observer

 When affixing paper to a cloth is placed on a plantebulb, the classification and control points on the paper are plotted after mounting the paper on the platen
 taduparant jis kshetra main surveykshan karnaa hota he, surveykshak usamen sthit ek aise niyantran vindu par planetebul le jaataa he jo uske kaagaj par ankit ho
 Such a point is called a station
 stesan ke upar tipai ko uske pair failaakar lagbhag kshaitij rakhaa jaataa he or usapar patal kas diya jaataa he
 The tripod's legs are placed in two successive right-angled positions on it, so that the bubble is centered
 isse planetebul kshaitij ho jaataa he
 Subsequent substitution is done
 diksthaapan planetebul kii us dasha ko kehete hai jab planetebul ke chitra par ankit niyantran vinduon ko kaagaj par jodanevaali rekhaayen unheen vinduon ko prithvi par jodanevaali rekhaon ke samanaantar ho jaaen
 To achieve this condition, the surveyor performs the following actions: Imagine, the surveyor is standing on an a point on the ground with an a on the paper
 isi prakaar ek duusare vindu kii bhaumik or aalekhith sthitiyaan kramash: b or b hon, to surveykshak apane darsharekhi kaa ek kinaaraa aise rakhata he ki vah a or b par sparshi rahe, dhagewali lakshya-vedhika b kii ore or zairi vaali lakshya-vedhika a kii ore rahe
 Then he rotates the plantebul on the tripod in such a way that the point b is seen cut from the thread
 aisi dasha praapt hone par vah planetebul kas detaa he
 In this way, the panel is set in its right directions
 is dasha main yadi darsharekhi nirdeshak dhar surveykshak kii sthiti a or kisi bhi duusare aalekhith vindu ko sparsh karti rakhi jaae to zairi se dekhne par dekhe janevaale vindu kii bhaumik sthiti dhaage par kategi
 It is worth remembering that the jhiri will always be towards the observer and the threaded observatory will be towards the observed point
 uparyukt dasha main patalchitr laakar, surveykshak apni aalekhith sthiti a vindu par apni pencil ke sahare darsharekhi kii dhar vindu ke sparshi rakhkar, anya vinduon ko zairi se agevale jharokhe main dhaage par katataa dekhtaa he or unki ore kirane khinchataa he
 He draws such rays to all the points he wants to show on the map, such as the twists and confluences of villages, rivers, roads, etc
 mode or sangam vindu hi isliye netaa he ki ruju bhaag to vah vindu milaati rekhaon se bhi bana sakat he
 This action is repeated at other stations
 isse kinhin bhi do stedhanon se di gai ek hi bindu kii kirane aapas main katkar, pratichhedan par vindu kii sahi saapeksh sthiti de dengi
 These conditions will be on the same scale as the writing of the silver
 yah patalchitran kii pratichchhed vidhi kehalaati he
 If the rays are drawn, by measuring respectively the distance of the same points and cut from the scale on the beam, the correct point is obtained
 ise surveykshan kii vikiran vidhi kehete hai
 If they are surveyed by measuring the distance, giving a point and giving a gradual rays from a station situated on the banks of things like a river, canal, road, etc
 to the invisible station, it is called a traversal survey
 kate vinduon ko rekhaon dwaara milakar surveykshak vastuon kii akritiyaan bana detaa he
 By looking at the map, he uses symbolic symbols to identify objects on the map on the ground and from the ground, so that the objects can also be differentiated into shapes
 udaahranarth, nahar, sadak, railmarg aadi ke sthaan par keval rekhaayen banengi, kintu surveykshak unhen bhinn rangon or dhangon se khinchakar dusron ko samajhane main samarth hota he
 The surveyor displays the relative heights between the points with contour lines
 iske liye patalchitran kii kriya sarvottam he
 The land is in front and the measurement, drafting and illustration activities go hand in hand
 saapeksh unchaaiyaan nikaalane ke liye natimapi kaa prayog hota he
 With this device, the observer can read the tangent of the angle formed due to the difference in height of any other point on its position
 patalchitr se us vindu kii apane se duuri nikaal saktaa he or tab us vindu kii saapeksh oonchaai nikaal letaa he
 In this way one can find the relative heights of all the points
 surveykshak kii bhinn-bhinn sthitiyon se nikaali saapeksh unchaaiyon main ekarupata rakhane ke liye unchaaiyaan kisi aadharatal se naapi jaati hai
 This base is generally considered to be the average floor of the sea measured taking into account the tide
 is tal se samaan oonchaai par sthit vinduon ko jodatii rekha ko samocch rekha kehete hai
 By pulling it, the surveyor gives an impression of height

 This motor company, which came into existence in 1939 by the merger of 13 private companies, was the only bus company to run buses in the pre-independence Kumaon region
 1987 tak yah is kshetra kii sabase badi bas company thi
 Motor traffic in Kumaon region first started in 1915 AD between nainital-kathgodam
 iske pashchaat 1920 i main kathgodam-almoda ke madhya motor yatayaat shuru hua
 In 1920, Munshi Lalta Prasad Tamta of Almora started a company called 'hill Motor Transport Company', under which the lorries ran from Haldwani and Kathgodam to Almora and Ranikhet
 kuch samay baad ek duusari choti company ‘da kumaun motor sarvice company’ prarambh hui, jo ki san 1922 ke uttararddh main sarvashree devi laal shah ganga ram ko hastantarit kar di gayi

 As a result, he was hanged on 23 March 1931 along with his two other companions, Rajguru and Sukhdev

 Due to the cancellation of the non-cooperation movement of Gandhiji, a little rage arose in him, but like the whole nation, he also respected Mahatma Gandhi
 par unhone gandhi ji ke ahimsaatmak aandolan kii jagah desh kii swatantrata ke liye hinsaatmak kranti kaa maarg apnaanaa anuchit nahin samajha
 He started participating in the processions and became a member of many revolutionary parties
 unke dal ke pramukh krantikariyon main chandrasekhar aaazaad, sukhdev, raajaguru ityadi the
 Bhagat Singh was so caught up with the hanging of 4 revolutionaries and imprisonment of 16 others in the Kakori case that he merged his party Naujawan Bharat Sabha into the Hindustan Republican Association in 1928 and gave it a new name Hindustan Socialist Republican Association

 As per the planned plan, Bhagat Singh and Rajguru started walking in a busy position in front of Lahore Kotwali

 On December 17, 1928, at about four and a quarter, as soon as ASP Saunders arrived, Rajguru shot a bullet directly into his head, immediately after which he lost consciousness
 iske baad bhagat singh ne 3-4 goli daag kar uske marane kaa puraa intazaam kar diya
 As both of them were running away, a constable Chanan Singh started chasing them
 chandrasekhar azaad ne use saavdhaan kiya - "aage bade to goli maar doongaa
 "azad shot him if he did not believe
 is tarah in logon ne lala lajpat raay kii maut kaa badla le liya
 Although Bhagat Singh was not in favor of bloodshed, he believed in leftist ideology, and was related to the principles of Karl Marx and he was advancing the same ideology
 yadhyapi, ve samaajwaad ke pakke poshak bhi the
 In the past, there have been allegations of tricking the youth in the name of Bhagat Singh by telling their ideology to them by their opponents
 congress ke satta main rahane ke baavjood bhagat singh ko congress shahid kaa darja nahi dilava paae,kyonki ve keval bhagat singh ke naam kaa istemaal yuvaaon ko apni party se jodne ke liye karte the
 He did not like the policy of the capitalists to exploit the workers
 us samay chunki angrej hi sarvesarva the tathaa bahut kam bhartiya udyogpati unnati kar paye the, atah angrejon ke mazdooron ke prati atyaachaar se unka virodh swaabhaavik tha
 It was their group's decision not to let the anti-labour policies be passed in the British Parliament
 sabhi chaahate the ki angrejon ko pataa chalanaa chaiye ki hindustani jaag chuke hai or unke hriday main aisi nitiyon ke prati aakrosh he
 To do so, he had planned to throw a bomb in Delhi Central Assembly
 bhagat singh chaahate the ki isamen koi khun kharaba na ho or angrejon tak unki 'awaz' bhi pahunche
 Although initially not everyone in his party thought so, in the end, the names of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt were unanimously chosen
 nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar 8 april 1929 ko kendriya asembli main in donon ne ek aise sthaan par bam phenkaa jahaan koi maujuud na tha, anyathaa use chot lag sakati thi
 The entire hall was filled with smoke
 bhagat singh chaahate to bhaag bhi sakate the par unhone pehle hi soch rakhaa tha ki unhen dand sweekaar he chahen vah phaansi hi kyon na ho; atah unhone bhaagane se manaa kar diya
 At that time both of them were wearing khaki shirt and shorts
 bam fatne ke baad unhone "inkulab-jindabad, samrajyavad-murdaabaad!" kaa naaraa lagaaya or apane saath laaye hue parche hawa main oochaal diye
 Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and both were arrested
 jail main bhagat singh ne kareeb 2 saal rahe
 During this, he kept writing articles and expressed his revolutionary views
 jail main rahete hue unka adhyayan baraabar jari rahaa
 His articles written during that time and letters written to his relatives are still mirrors of his thoughts
 apane lekhon main unhone kai tarah se poonjipatiyon ko apana shatru bataaya he
 He wrote that even if an Indian is the one who exploits the workers, he is their enemy
 unhone jail main angrezi main ek lekh bhi likhaa jiskaa sheershak tha main naastik kyon hoon? jail main bhagat singh va unke saathiyon ne 64 dinon tak bhukh hadtal kii
 One of his companions, Yatindranath Das, gave up his life in a hunger strike
 26 agast, 1930 ko adaalat ne bhagat singh ko bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 129, 302 tathaa visphotak padaarth adhinium kii dhara 4 or 6epa tathaa ipisi kii dhara 120 ke antargat apradhi siddh kiya
 On 7 October 1930, the court gave a 68-page judgment, in which Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were sentenced to death
 faansee kii sajaa sunaae jane ke saath hi lahore main dhara 144 laga di gai
 After this, an appeal was filed in the Privy Council for the forgiveness of Bhagat Singh's execution, but this appeal was canceled on 10 January 1931
 iske baad tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh pan
 madan mohan malviya ne vysarai ke saamne sajaa maafee ke liye 14 farvari, 1931 ko apil daayar kii ki vah apane visheshadhikaar kaa prayog karte hue maanavtaa ke aadhaar par faansee kii sajaa maaf kar den
 Mahatma Gandhi spoke to the Viceroy on 17 February 1931 to pardon the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, then on 18 February 1931, on behalf of the general public, also filed an appeal before the Viceroy for forgiveness with various arguments
 yah sab kuch bhagat singh kii ichha ke khilaaf ho rahaa tha kyon ki bhagat singh nahin chaahate the ki unki sajaa maaf kii jaae
 On 23 March 1931, Bhagat Singh and his two companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged at around 7
33 pm in the evening
 phaansi par jane se pehle ve lenin kii jeevani pard rahe the or jab unase unki aakhri ichha poochi gai to unhone kaha ki vah lenin kii jeevani pard rahe the or unhen vah puri karne kaa samay diya jaae
 It is said that when the officials of the jail informed them that the time had come for their execution, they had said- "stop! First, meet one revolutionary other
 " phir ek minute baad kitaab chat kii ore oochaal kar bole - "thik he ab chalo
 " phaansi par jate samay ve teenon masti se ga rahe the - Fearing that no movement could erupt after the hanging, the British first sliced their dead bodies, then filled them in sacks and took them to Ferozepur where they were burnt by adding kerosene instead of ghee
 gaanv ke logon ne aag jalati dekhi to kareeb aaye
 Fearing this, the British threw half of their dead bodies into the Sutlej River and ran away
 jab gaanv vaale paas aaye tab unhone inke mrit sharir ke tukdo kon ekatrit kar vidhivat dah sanskaar kiya
 And Bhagat Singh became immortal forever
 iske baad log angrejon ke saath-saath gandhi ko bhi inaki maut kaa jimmevaar samajhane lage
 For this reason, when Gandhi was going to attend the Lahore session of the Congress, people welcomed Gandhiji with black flags
 ekaadh jagah par gandhi par hamalaa bhi hua, kintu saadi vardi main unke saath chal rahi police ne bachaa liya
 His thoughts are reflected from his letters and articles written during his jail time
 unhone bhartiya samaaj main lipi, jati or dharm ke kaaran aayi duriyon par dukh vyakt kiya tha
 He also thought of the attack of an Indian on the weaker section of society in the same manner as the atrocities committed by an Englishman
 bhagat singh ko hindi, urdu, punjabi tathaa angreji ke alaava bangla bhi aati thi jo unhone batukeshwar dutt se sikhi thi
 He believed that his martyrdom would cause the Indian public to become more agitated and this could hardly happen with his life
 isi kaaran unhone maut kii sajaa sunaane ke baad bhi mafinama likhane se saaf manaa kar diya tha
 Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil', in his autobiography, gave the guidelines, Bhagat Singh followed them literally
 unhone angrej sarkaar ko ek patr bhi likhaa, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki unhen angrezi sarkaar ke kilaaf bharatiyon ke yuddh kaa pratik ek yudhbandi samajha jaye tathaa phaansi dene ke bajaay goli se uda diya jaye
 In a letter sent to his brother Kulatar on March 3, before hanging, Bhagat Singh wrote - unhen yah fikr he hardam, nayi tarz-e-zafaa kya he? hamen yah shauk he dekhen, sitam kii intahaa kya he? Why should you be upset with the poison, what should be done of the wheel
 sara jahaan adu sahi, aao! muqaabala karen
 
 in joshili panktiyon se unke shaury kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 At the time of his first meeting with Chandrashekhar Azad, he swore that his life would be sacrificed for the country and he showed his promise
 “kisi ne sach hi kaha he, sudhaar buudhe aadmi nahin kar sakate 
 They are very intelligent and intelligent
 sudhaar to hote hai yuvakon ke parishram, saahas, balidaan or nishtha se, jinako bhaybheet hona aata hi nahin or jo vichaar kam or anubhav adhik karte hai 
 Bhagat Singh unki mrityu kii khabar ko lahore ke dainik tribune tathaa neuyork ke ek patr daily varkar ne chapa
 Even after this, many Marxist papers published articles on them, but since the arrival of Marxist letters in India was banned in those days, Indian intellectuals were not aware of this
 deshbhar main unki shahadat ko yaad kiya gaya
 In South India, Periyar wrote his article "why am i an atheist?" But he wrote an editorial in Tamil in the 22-29 March 1931 issue of his weekly paper Kudai Aarsu
 isamen bhagatsingh kii prashansa kii gai thi tathaa unki shahadat ko british samrajyavad ke upar jeet ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 Even today the people of India and Pakistan see Bhagat Singh as the lover of freedom who dedicated his life including his youth to the country

 In addition, 17 ketosteroid levels increased and total eosinophil levels decreased as a result of Tylophora indica intake
 Allergy rhinitis In another double blind study cross-over 50 allergic rhinitis patients were given either Tylophora indica or a placebo capsule
 
 marijon ko 7 dinon ke liye prati din 1 capsule praapt kiya
 This was followed by a washout period of 5 days, then a cross for the other capsules

 The authors suggest that one capsule twice a day for a long period of a fortnight may be a higher dose, after which the dose may be reduced and be more effective

 To avoid the confusion caused by the ambiguity of sin−1, the reciprocals and inverses of trigonometric functions are often displayed as in this table
 In representing the cosecant function, the longer form 'cosec' is sometimes used in place of 'csc'
 Different angular measures can be appropriate in different situations
 This table shows some of the more common systems
 Radians is the default angular measure and is the one you use if you use the exponential definitions
 All angular measures are unitless
 From the two identities above, the following table can be extrapolated
 Note however that these conversion equations may not provide the correct sign 
 For example, if sin θ = 1 / 2, the conversion in the table indicates that cos ⁡ θ = 1 − sin 2 ⁡ θ = 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ ,= \ ,{ \ sqrt {1- \ sin ^{2} \ theta }}={ \ sqrt {3}} / 2}, though it is possible that cos ⁡ θ = − 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ ,= \ ,-{ \ sqrt {3}} / 2} 
 More information would be needed about which quadrant θ lies in to determine a single, exact answer
 Rarely used today, the versine, coversine, haversine, and exsecant have been defined as below and used in navigation, for example the haversine formula was used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere
 ikai vrutt kaa pareekshan karke ham trikonmittiya falnon ke nimnlikhit gunon ko sthapit kar sakate hai: When the trigonometric functions are reflected from certain values of θ { \ displaystyle \ theta}, the result is often one of the other trigonometric functions
 This leads to the following identities: By shifting the function round by certain angles, it is often possible to find different trigonometric functions that express the result more simply
 Some examples of this are given shown by shifting functions round by π / 2, π and 2π radians
 Because the periods of these functions are either π or 2π, there are cases where the new function is exactly the same as the old function without the shift

 In these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many terms: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors and cofinitely many cosine factors
 If only finitely many of the terms θi are nonzero, then only finitely many of the terms on the right side will be nonzero because sine factors will vanish, and in each term, all but finitely many of the cosine factors will be unity

 These can be demonstrated with the help of sum and difference identities or with the help of multiplicity-angle identities

 These can be obtained using the second and third forms of the cosine bi-property angle formula
 If x, y, and z are the three angles of any triangle, or in other words as tan either increases through positive values or decreases through negative values
 This is a one-point compactification of the real line
) Essentially this is Ptolemy's theorem adapted to the language of trigonometry
 For some purposes it is important to know that any linear combination of sine waves of the same period but different phase shifts is also a sine wave with the same period, but a different phase shift
 In the case of a linear combination of a sine and cosine wave, we have where More generally, for an arbitrary phase shift, we have where and Sum of sines and cosines with arguments in arithmetic progression: For any a and b: where arctan is the generalization of arctan which covers the entire circular range 
 The above identity is sometimes convenient to know when thinking about the Gudermanian function

 if x + y + z = π, then where i2 = −1
 saanchaa:split-sectionoccasionally one sees the notation ie "cis" abbreviates "cos & + & i & sin"
 Though at first glance this notation is redundant, being equivalent to eix, its use is rooted in several advantages
 This notation was more common in the post WWII era when typewriters were used to convey mathematical expressions
superscripts are both offset vertically and smaller than 'cis' or 'exp'; hence, they can be problematic even for hand writing
 For example e ix2 versus cis versus exp
 For many readers, cis is the clearest, easiest to read of the three
 The cis notation is sometimes used to emphasize one method of viewing and dealing with a problem over another
 The mathematics of trigonometry and exponentials are related but not exactly the same; exponential notation emphasizes the whole, whereas cis and cos& +& i& sin notations emphasize the parts
 This can be rhetorically useful to mathematicians and engineers when discussing this function, and further serve as a mnemonic 
 The cis notation is convenient for math students whose knowledge of trigonometry and complex numbers permit this notation, but whose conceptual understanding does not yet permit the notation e ix
 As students learn concepts that build on prior knowledge, it is important not to force them into levels of math they are not yet prepared for
 In some contexts, the cis notation may serve the pedagogical purpose of emphasizing that one has not yet proved that this is an exponential function
 In doing trigonometry without complex numbers, one may prove the two identities Similarly in treating multiplication of complex numbers, one may observe that the real and imaginary parts of the product of c1 & + & is1 and c2 & + & is2 are respectively Thus one sees this same pattern arising in two disparate contexts: This coincidence can serve as a motivation for conjoining the two contexts and thereby discovering the trigonometric identity and observing that this identity for cis of a sum is simpler than the identities for sin and cos of a sum
 Having proved this identity, one can challenge the students to recall which familiar sort of function satisfies this same functional equation The answer is exponential functions
 That suggests that cis may be an exponential function Then the question is: what is the base b? The definition of cis and the local behavior of sin and cos near zero suggest that 
 Thus the rate of change at 0 is i, so the base should be ei
 Thus if this is an exponential function, then it must be For applications to special functions, the following infinite product formulæ for trigonometric functions are useful: The Gudermannian function relates the circular and hyperbolic trigonometric functions without resorting to complex numbers; see that article for details
 The curious identity is a special case of an identity that contains one variable: a similar-looking identity is and in addition The following is perhaps not as readily generalized to an identity containing variables: Degree measure ceases to be more felicitous than radian measure when we consider this identity with 21 in the denominators: The factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 may start to make the pattern clear: they are those integers less than 21 / 2 that are relatively prime to 21
 The last several examples are corollaries of a basic fact about the irreducible cyclotomic polynomials: the cosines are the real parts of the zeroes of those polynomials; the sum of the zeroes is the Möbius function evaluated at 21; only half of the zeroes are present above
 The two identities preceding this last one arise in the same fashion with 21 replaced by 10 and 15, respectively
 An efficient way to compute π is based on the following identity without variables, due to Machin: or, alternatively, by using Euler's formula: With the golden ratio φ: Also see exact trigonometric constants
 In calculus the relations stated below require angles to be measured in radians; the relations would become more complicated if angles were measured in another unit such as degrees
 If the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of geometry, their derivatives can be found by verifying two limits
 The first is: verified using the unit circle and squeeze theorem
 It may be tempting to propose to use l'hôpital's rule to establish this limit
 However, if one uses this limit in order to prove that the derivative of the sine is the cosine, and then uses the fact that the derivative of the sine is the cosine in applying l'hôpital's rule, one is reasoning circularly—a logical fallacy
 The second limit is: verified using the identity tan =) / sin
 Having established these two limits, one can use the limit definition of the derivative and the addition theorems to show that sin ′ = cos and cos ′ = −sin
 If the sine and cosine functions are defined by their Taylor series, then the derivatives can be found by differentiating the power series term-by-term
 The rest of the trigonometric functions can be differentiated using the above identities and the rules of derivative: The integral identities can be found in "list of integrals of trigonometric functions"
 The fact that the differentiation of trigonometric functions results in linear combinations of the same two functions is of fundamental importance to many fields of mathematics, including differential equations and fourier transformations
 The Dirichlet kernel Dn is the function occurring on both sides of the next identity: The convolution of any integrable function of period 2π with the Dirichlet kernel coincides with the function's nth-degree Fourier approximation
 The same holds for any measure or generalized function

 Abhigyan Shakuntalam is a world-famous drama by Mahakavi Kalidas, which has been translated into almost all foreign languages
 isamen raja dushyant tathaa shakuntala ke pranay, vivaah, virah, pratyaakhyaan tathaa punarmilan kii ek sundar kahani he
 In the legend, Dushyant is realized by Akashvani, but in this drama the poet has made it known by Mudrika
 isaki naatakeeyata, iske sundar cathopakathan, isaki kavy-saundarya se bhari upmaayen or sthaan-sthaan par prayukt hui samyochit sukhtiyaan; or in sabase badhkar vividh prasangon kii dhvanyaatmakataa itani adbhut he ki in drushtiyon se dekhne par sanskrit ke bhi anya naatak abhigyaan shaakuntal se takkar nahin le sakate; phir anya bhashaaon kaa to kahana hi kya ! to yaheen sabase zyada acha he
 Kalidas did not choose Abhigyan Shakuntal's story as original
 yah katha mahabharat ke adiparv se lee gai he
 Thus the story of Shakuntala is also found in Padmapuran and it is more close to the story of Shakuntala than Mahabharata
 is kaaran vinternitz ne yah mana he ki shakuntala kii katha padmapurana se lee gai he
 But scholars have said that this part of Padmapurana was written after the creation of Shakuntala and later appears projectile
 mahabharat kii katha main durvasa ke shaap kaa ullekh nahin he
 The Mahabharata is very different from Dushyant, if not exactly the opposite
 mahabharat kii shakuntala bhi kalidas kii bhaanti salajj nahin he
 She narrates the story of her birth to Dushyant as a result of Vishwamitra and Maneka's relationship with her mouth
 mahabharat main dushyant shakuntala ke rup par mugdh hokar shakuntala se gandharv vivaah kii prarthana karata he; jis par shakuntala kahati he ki main vivaah is shart par kar sakati hum ki rajsinghaasana mere putr ko hi mili
 Dushyant at that time accepts and later returns to his capital and does not deliberately accept the shameful Shakuntala
 kalidas ne is prakaar aprishkrut rup main praapt hui katha ko apni kalpana se adbhut rup main nikhaar diya he
 By imagining the curse of Durvasa, he elevated the character of Dushyanta
 kalidas kii shakuntala bhi abhijatya, saundarya or karunaa kii murti he
 Apart from this, the manner in which Kalidas has performed the whole story, portraying emotions, etc
 is original and unique
 shakuntla raja dushyant kii patni thi jo bharat ke suprasiddh raja bharat kii mata or menka apsara kii kanya thi
 It is written in the Mahabharata that Shankutla was born from the womb of Maneka Apsara, who left it in the forest
 van main shankuton aadi ne hinsak pashuon se isaki raksha kii thi, isi se iskaa naam shakuntla padaa
 Kanva Rishi brought it out of the forest and kept it like a girl, keeping it in her ashram
 ek baar raja dushyant apane saath kuch sainikon ko lekar shikaar khilne nikle or ghoomte phirte kanv rishi ke ashram main pahunche
 The sage was not present there at that time; With this, the young woman Shakuntala welcomed King Dushyant
 usee avasar par donon main prem or phir gandharva vivaah ho gaya
 a few days later King Dushyant left his kingdom from there
 kanv muni jab lautakar aae, tab yah jaanakar bahut prasann hue ki shakuntla kaa vivaah dushyant se ho gaya
 Shakuntala was pregnant at that time
 samay paakar uske garbh se bahut hi balvan or tejasvi putr utpann hua, jiskaa naam 'bharat' rakhaa gaya
 It is said that the name 'bharat' was named after 'bharat'
 kuch dinon baad shakuntla apane putr ko lekar dushyant ke darbar main pahaunchi
 But Shakuntala had got the curse of Durvasa Rishi in the middle
 raja ne ise bilkul nahin pahachaanaa or spasht kah diya ki na to main tumhen jaanata hoon or na tumhen apane yahan aashray de saktaa hoon
 But on this occasion there was an All India Radio, which informed the king that this is my wife and this son is also mine
 unhen kanv muni ke ashram kii sab baaten samaran ho ain or unhone shakuntla ko apni pradhan rani banaakar apane yahan rakh liya
 'abhigyan Shakuntalam' mentions many touching episodes
 ek us samay, jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa pratham milan hota he
 Secondly, when Kanva leaves Shakuntala from her ashram for her husband's house
 us samay to swayan rishi kehete hai ki mere jaise rishi ko apni paalita kanya main yah moh he to jinaki oras putriyaan patigrih ke liye vidaa hoti hai us samay unki kya sthiti hoti hogi
 The third episode is Shakuntala's presence at Dushyant's meeting and Dushyant's refusal to recognize her
 chauthaa prasang he us samay kaa, jab machuaare ko praapt dushyant ke naam vaali anguthi usko dikhaai jaati he
 And the fifth episode of the union of dushyant-shakuntala in the ashram of Maarishi Maharishi
 shakuntala main kalidas kaa sabase bada chamatkaar uske dhvanyatmak sanketon main he
 In this, the poet has had a unique success in that he did not use any object anywhere
 koi bhi paatr, koi bhi cathope-kathan, koi bhi ghatana, koi bhi prakritik drishy nishprayojan nahin he
 All the events give a miraculous indication of the events ahead
 naatak ke prarambh main hi greeshm-varnan karte hue van-vaayu ke patal kii sugandhi se milakar sugandhit ho uthne or chaaya main letate hi neend aane lagane or diwas kaa ant romantic hone ke dwaara naatak kii katha-vastu kii mote taur par soochna de di gai he, jo kramshah pehle shakuntala or dushyant ke milan, uske baad neend-prabhaav se shakuntala ko bhul jane or naatak kaa ant sukhad hone kii suchak he
 Similarly, the initial song of the play by the illusors kissing the flowers of Shirish a little bit indicates that Dushyant and Shakuntala's union would be short-lived
 jab raja dhanush par baan chadaaye harin ke peeche daude ja rahe hai, tabhi kuch tapasvi aakar rokte hai
 It is said - 'maharaj' this is the stag of the ashram, do not shoot arrows at it
 ’ yahaan harin ke atirikt shakuntala kii ore bhi sanket he, jo harin ke samaan hi bholi-bhali or asahaay he
 'whereas the very fickle life of the stag and the hard arrow like your thunderbolt!' It also has a poignant indication of Shakuntala's helplessness and simplicity and the ruthlessness of the king
 jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa prem kuch or badhane lagata he, tabhi nepathy se pukaar sunai padati he ki ‘tapasviyo, ashram ke praaniyon kii raksha ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 The hunter king Dushyant has come here
 ’ isamen bhi dushyant ke haathon se shakuntala kii raksha kii ore sanket kiya gaya prathit hota he, parantu yah sanket kisi ke bhi kaan main sunai nahin diya; shakuntala ko kisi ne nahin bachaaya
 This increases the compassion of the situation even more
 chauthe ank ke praarambhik bhaag main kanv ke shishy ne prabhaat kaa varnan karte hue sukh or dukh ke nirantar saath lage rahane kaa tathaa priy ke viyog main striyon ke asay dukh kaa jo ullekh kiya he, vah dushyant dwaara shakuntala kaa parityag kiye jane ke liye pehle se hi prishthbhumi-si bana detaa he
 In the fifth issue, Rani Hanspadika sings a song, in which the king is praised for his sweet-heartedness
 dushyant bhi yah sweekaar karte hai ki unhone hansapadika se ek hi baar prem kiya he
 This gives the poet a serious indication that even though Shakuntala was forgotten by Dushyant because of Durvasa's curse, it was not new for him to ignore the queens once they were in love
 anya raniyaan bhi uski is madhukar-vritti kaa shikaar thim
 The incident of Shakuntala's abandonment seems even more cruel and harsh in the backdrop of this song from Hansapadika
 isi prakaar ke dhvanyatmak sanketon se kalidas ne saatven ank main dushyant, shakuntala or uske putr ke milane ke liye sukhad prishthbhumi taiyaar kar di he
 Indra King confers uncommon respect to Dushyant
 uske baad hemkut parvat par prajapati ke ashram main pahunchate hi raja ko anubhav hone lagata he ki jaise vah amrit ke sarovar main snaan kar rahe hon
 After such signs, the union of Dushyant and Shakuntala becomes even more delightful
 german kavi gete ne abhigyaan shaakuntalan ke bare main kaha tha- Similarly, this verse is famous among Sanskrit scholars- iskaa arth he - kavy ke jitne bhi prakaar hai unamem naatak vishesh sundar hota he
 In plays also, Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top in terms of poetry
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 His fourth verse in Abhigyan Shakuntalam and fourth verse in this issue is very delightful
 abhigyaan shaakuntal main naatakeeyata ke saath-saath kavy kaa ansh bhi yathesht maatra main he
 Shringar is the main juice in it; And its coincidence and disconnection have matured beautifully on both sides
 iske atirikt hasya, vir tathaa karun ras kii bhi jahaan-tahaan acchhee abhivyakti hui he
 Beautiful and enchanting expectations from place to place not only amazes the reader, but also helps in increasing the intensity of the desired emotion
 saare naatak main kalidas ne apni upamaaon or utprekshaon kaa upyog kahin bhi keval alankaar-pradarshan ke liye nahin kiya
 Their simile or catalysis at each place has helped in making the expression of meaning juicy
 kalidas apni upamaaon ke liye sanskrit-sahitya main prasiddh hai
 In Shakuntal too, his power to choose the appropriate simile was well known
 shakuntala ke vishay main ek jagah raja dushyant kehete hai ki ‘vah aisa phool he, jise kisi ne suungha nahin he; aisa navpallav he, jis par kisi ke nakhon kii kharonch nahin lagi; aisa ratna he, jisamen chhed nahin kiya gaya or aisa madhu he, jiskaa swaad kisi ne chakhaa nahin he
 'through these similes, a unique glimpse of Shakuntala's beauty comes before our eyes
 isi prakaar paanchaven ank main dushyant shakuntala kaa parityag karte hue kehete hai ki ‘he tapaswini, kya tum vaise hi apane kul ko kalankit karnaa or mujhe patit karnaa chaahati ho, jaise tat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi tat ke vriksh ko to giraati hi he or apane jal ko bhi malin kar leti he
 'upma, given here by the river flowing through the river of Shakuntala, is particularly helpful in expressing the king's mood
 isi prakaar jab kanv ke shishy shakuntala ko saath lekar dushyant ke paas pahunchate hai to dushyant kii drushti un tapasviyon ke bich main shakuntala ke upar jaakar padati he
 By not giving a detailed description of Shakuntala's beauty there, the poet has only said to her mouth that 'who is that veiled beauty among these ascetics, which looks like a new spring in the midst of yellow leaves
 ’ is choti-si upama ne pile pattey or konpal kii sadrishyata ke dwaara shakuntala ke soundarya kaa puraa hi chitrankan kar diya he
 Similarly, looking at Sarvadamana, Dushyant says that 'this majestic child appears like the fire that is burning, looking for fuel to become a blazing fire
 ’ is upama se kalidas ne na keval balak kii tejaswita prakat kar di, balki yah bhi spasht rup se suchit kar diya he ki yah balak bada hokar mahapratapi chakravarti samraat banegaa
 Many examples of such delightful similes can be given from Shakuntal because 180 similes have been used in Shakuntal
 or unamem se sabhi ek se ek badhkar hai
 It is fine that Kalidas had special skill in the choice of Upma and it is also true that some of his beautiful analogies are rare in the compositions of other poets, yet Kalidasa's biggest feature is not upma-kaushal
 upama-kaushal to unke kavy-kaushal kaa ek saamaanya-sa ang he
 Kalidas knows many methods to express his mood or to perfect a rasa or to awaken the intense feeling of an emotion
 shabdon kaa prasangochit chayan, abhisht bhav ke upyukt chand kaa chunaav or vyanjana-shakti kaa prayog karke kalidas ne apni style ko vishesh rup se romantic bana diya he
 Where Kalidas has descended on Shakuntala's aesthetic narrative, he has not satisfied by merely drawing the form of Shakuntala by similes and incantations
 pehle-pehle to unhone keval itnaa kahalwaya ki ‘yadi tapovana ke nivaasiyon main itnaa rup he, to samajho ki van-lataaon ne udyaan kii lataaon ko maat kar diya
 Then he told Dushyant's face that 'it is like to plant such a beautiful girl in the rules of the ashram, like cutting the acacia tree from the petals of Neel Kamal
 ’ uske baad kalidas kehete hai ki ‘shakuntala kaa rup aisa manohar he ki bhale hi usne motaa valkal vastra pahana hua he, phir usase bhi uskaa saundarya kuch gata nahin, balki badha hi he
 Because whatever is given to a beautiful person becomes his ornament
 ’ uske baad raja shakuntala kii sukumaar deh kii tulana hari-bhari phulon se ladi lata ke saath karte hai, jisase us vilakshan saudarya kaa swaroop pathak kii ankhon ke saamne chitrit-sa ho uthta he
 After this, Kalidasa has brought a bhramar to bring that beauty to the climax; Who considers the face of Shakuntala as a beautiful blossoming flower and hovers over it to make it juicy
 is prakaar kalidas ne shakuntala ke saundarya ko chitrit karne ke liye anlakaaron kaa sahaara utana nahin liya, jitna ki vyanjanashkti kaa; or yah vyajana-shakti hi kavy kii jaan maani jaati he
 Renaissance or Renaissance is a cultural movement that came in Europe in the medieval period
 yah aandolan italy se armbh hokar puure europe fail gaya
 The time of this movement is believed to be from the fourteenth century to the seventeenth century
 'rinaishan' kaa arth 'punarjanm' hota he
 Primarily it shows a sense of reputations of ancient classical knowledge of Greece and Rome
 europe main madhyayug kii samaapti or aadhunik yug kaa prarambh isi samay se mana jaataa he
 It originated in Italy during the times of people like Francisco Petrarch, when he appeared in Greek and Latin works supporting his ideas and beliefs about man's power and pride
 1453 main jab kastutuniya par turkon ne adhikaar kar liya, to vahaan se bhaagnevaale isai apane saath pracheen unani pandulipiyaan pashchim lete gaye
 Thus the scholars of Greek and Latin literature unexpectedly got valuable ideas of the Byzantine Empire
 charles pancham dwaara rome kii vijay ke pashchaat punarjagran kii bhaavana alps ke paar puure europe main fail gai
 In the Italian Renaissance, more attention was given to its form than the content of literature
 germany main iskaa arth shram or aatmasanyam tha, italviyon ke liye aaraam or aamod-pramod hi maanviya adarsh tha
 Dutch and German artists, among whom Halven and Albert Dürer are notable, showed more interest in daily life around them than in classical literature
 vaigyanik uplabdhiyon ke kshetra main germany italy se bhi aage nikal gaya
