 They are of the opinion that animals can be separated on the basis of their way of living, nature and physical size
 inhone pakshi, machhlee, hwel, keet aadi jantusamoohon kaa ullekh kiya he or chote samoohon ke liye colioptera or dyptera aadi shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya he
 The botanists of this time were ahead of Aristotle's ideology
 unhone sthaneey paudhon kaa safal vargeekaran kar rakhaa tha
 Brunfels and Bauhin were scientists on the successful path of plant taxonomy, but the experts of this time classifying animals were still working under Aristotle's ideology
 janvigyaan visheshgyon main jon re pratham vyakti the, jinhone jati or vansh main antar spasht kiya or pracheen vaigyanikon main ye pratham the, jinhone ucchtar prakritik vargeekaran kiya

 Therefore, they are considered to be the father of classification science

 Linnaeus created five such categories: prayek shrenee main ek athwa ek se adhik neeche str ke samooh sammilit hote hai or ve nimna shrenee banaate hai
 Similarly each successive category belongs to one or more higher category
 ye shreniyan prakritik prabhed kam karke ek vyapak pranali bana detii hai
 With the development of knowledge, the number of these categories increased
 jagat or varg ke bich sangh or gana tathaa vansh ke bich main kutumb naamak shreniyan jodi gai
 According to Linnaeus, the species is an alternative category, which includes geographical or individual variation
 is tarah ab nimna saat shreniyan ho gai hai : For a more accurate interpretation of the classification, these categories are also divided into other categories

 Only the primitive caste is used between the family and the clan
 kuch lekhakon ne, jaise simpasan, ne gana or varg ke bich sahagan naam kaa prayog kiya he
 In this way, the number of commonly used categories is presently as follows: vartmaan samay main 'anterrashtriya namakaran code' dwaara jeevon ke vargeekaran kii saat shreniyan paribhaashit kii gayi hai
 These categories are - Jagat, Sangha, class, Gana, clan, clan and caste
 In recent years, another level called domain has come into vogue which is placed above the 'world'

 So, there is a close relationship between the two parts of the Bible

 bible main prasangvash loukik gyaan vigyaan sambandhi baaten bhi aa gai hai; unpar taatkaalik dharanaon kii puri chhap he kyonki bible unke vishay main shaayad hi koi nirdesh dena chaahati he

 When there was no bridge in Umeo, the folk used to cross the Ume river in winter through snow paths and with the help of installments in the remaining seasons

 There are many ideologies about the nature of Parabrahma in India
 jisamen dwait, advait yaa keoladvait, vishishtadvait, shuddhadvait, dwaitadvait jaisi kai saidhantik vichaardhaaraein hai
 The Acharya described the form in which Brahma came to know
 itani vichaardhaaraein hone par bhi sabhi yah maanate he ki bhagwaan hi is sristi kaa niyantaa he
 The founder of the Advaita ideology is Shankaracharya, also known as Shankaradvaita or Kevaladvaita
 shankaracharya maanate hain ki sansar main brahm hi satya he
 Everything else is false
 jeev keval agyaan ke kaaran hi brahm ko nahin jaan paata jabaki brahm to uske hi andar virajman he
 He has stated Advaita principle in his Brahmasutra by saying "ego Brahmasmi"
 vallabhacharya apane shuddhadvait darshan main brahm, jeev or jagat, teenon ko satya maanate hai, jise vedon, upanishdon, brahmasutra, gita tathaa shrimadbhagwat dwaara unhone siddh kiya he
 The Advaita principle also permeates the pasture world
 jab pair main kaanta chubhta he tab aakhon se pani aata he or haath kaanta nikaalaneke liye jaataa he
 This is a perfect example of Advaita
 shankaracharya kaa ‘ecobrahm, dwitiyao naasti’ mat tha
 Parambrahm existed before creation
 brahm sat or sristi jagat asat he
 By Shankaracharya's opinion, Brahman is nirguna, passive, sata-asat, separate from work-cause
 brahm ankhon se nahin dekha ja saktaa, man se nahin janaa ja saktaa, vah gyaata nahin he or na gyey hi he, gyaan or kriya ke bhi ateet he
 Due to Maya, the living being is not able to know 'ego Brahma'

 In modern parlance, a sophist is someone who can invent tips, explanations, and ideas to help others
 kintu yah "sofist" kaa mul arth nahin he
 In ancient Greek philosophy, only philosophers were philosophers
 tab "filosphos" kaa prachlan na tha
 In the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, some border philosophers of Greece agitated against cultural ideas
 athens nagar pracheen unani samskruti kaa centre tha
 Laughter of this movement was blown there
 aflatoon ke kuch sanvaadon ke naam sofist kahe janevaale darshanikon ke naamon par hai
 Presenting a dispute between Socrates and the leading sophists, the sophists are finally released
 sucraat ke aatmatyag se yunaan main uskaa sammaan itnaa adhik ho gaya tha ki sucraat ko sophist andolan kaa virdohi samajhakar, parampara ne "sofist" shabd apmaanasoochak maan liya
 In fact, it was the philosophers who humanized Greek civilization
 inase purv, kabhi kisi unani darshanik ne manushya ko sabhyataa evam samskruti kaa nirmaataa nahin samajha tha
 In the Ekian civilization, which is reflected in Hamar's epic titled Iliad, the weight of creation was assigned to the goddesses of Olympus
 chhathi shatabdi isa purv main devi devataaon se anichhaa hone par jis darshan kaa sutarapaat hua, vah prakruti, athwa niyati ko sansar or uski sampurna gati vidhi kii janani maan baitha tha

 He divided the society into free men and slaves

 The neglected class had no place in public works
 parivartan kii kisi bhi yojana ke safal hone kii aashaa tabhi kii ja sakati thi, jab puraani dooshit paramparaon ke surakshit rakhane kaa shrey manushya ko diya jaataa
 Therefore, the Sophists established humanistic philosophy in place of naturalist philosophy
 afalaatoon ke "protagoras" naamak samvaad main prasiddh sofist protagoras ke mukh se kahalaaya gaya he - manushya sabhi vastuon kii maap he, jo hai unka ki ve hai, jo nahin hai unka ki ve nahin hai
 This was the main voice of the philosophy of sophist thinkers
 isi se pracheen paramparaon ke poshakon ne, "sofist" kahkar unka uphaas kiya
 But he was the pioneer of the revival of Greek civilization
 sofist vichaarkon ne naagarik evam das kaa bhedbhaav mitaakar sabko shiksha dena prarambh kiya

 Aristotle did not accept his loan, but in his "retirix" he used two of his material
 prodicas ne milte julate shabdon kaa arthbhed spasht karne ke liye pustaken likhin thim
 From the point of view of education, how important was this work in the ancient times when the dictionary of Greek language was not created
 yahi nahin, sofiston ne vigyaan aadi vishyon par bhi paath taiyaar kiye
 It is famous that sophists used arbitrary meanings of any word
 par unke is kaary kaa ek doosraa paksh bhi he
 Till then no limited lecture was developed
 sofiston ke is kaary se vichaarkon kii ankhen khuleen or unhone samajha ki chintan ke niyam sthir karke hi vyakhyaaon ko simit kiya ja saktaa he
 It would probably not be unfair to consider Aristotle's "law of identification" as the result of the independent interpretation of the sophists
 parampara ne sofiston ko sthool vyaktvaad kaa poshak tehraaya he
 But if Protagoras's statement that "man is the measure of all things" would be a big mistake, if we take a brief commentary of the philosophical views developed by that time

 Aristotle was later the originator of Western logic

 Keshavdas was a great scholar of Sanskrit
 unke kul main bhi sanskrit kaa hi prachaar tha
 The servants also spoke Sanskrit
 unke kul main bhi sanskrit chhod hindi bhashaa main kavita karnaa unhen kuch apmanjanak-sa laga - Keshav was a very emotional and jovial person
 kaha jaataa ki ek baar vrudhdavastha main ve kisi kuen par baithe the
 Some women who came to fill the water addressed him as Baba
 is par unhone nimna doha kaha - Around the year 1608, Jahangir gave the kingdom of Orchha to Vir Singh Dev
 keshav kuch samay tak vir singh ke darbar main rahe, phir gangatat par chale gaye or vahiin rahane lage
 He died in 1618 AD

 Rasikapriya is an adult work by Keshav, which is a poetry book
 isamen ras, vritti or kavyadosha ke lakshan udhaaharan die gaye hai
 Its main foundation texts are Natyashastra, Kamasutra and Rudrabhatta's Shringaratilak
 kavipriya kavyashiksha sambandhi granth he jo indrajeetsingh kii rakshita or keshav kii shishyaa pravinrai ke liye prastut kiya gaya tha
 It is based on choice and poetry
 ramchandrika unka sarvaadhik prasiddh mahakavy he jisaki rachana main prasanraghav, hanumannatak, kadambari aadi kai grantho se saamagi grahan kii gai hai
 In Ratanbavani, Yatoghan is the son of Madhukarshah, Ratansen, Anuj Veerasingh and Jahangir Jaschandrika of Indrajit Singh in Veerasingh Charit
 vigyaangita main prabodhachandroday ke aadhaar par rachit anyaapadeshik kavy he
 Keshav Alankar was a sectarian poet
 isaliye swaabhaavik tha ki ve bhamah, udbhat or dandi aadi alankaar sampradaay ke aacharyon kaa anusaran karte
 He considered two distinctions of ornaments, ordinary and specific
 saadhaaran ke antargat varnan, varnya, bhumishri-varnan or rajyashri-varnan aate he jo kavyakalpaltavriti or alankarishekhar par aadhaarit hai
 In this way they do not distinguish between rhetoric and ornamentation
 alankaaron ke prati vishesh ruchi hone ke kaaran kavyapaksh dab gaya he or saamanyat: ye sahruday kavi nahin maane jate
 They have been called the phantom of difficult poetry due to their attrition
 vishisht prabandhkavy ramchandrika prabadhanirvaah, maarmik sthalon kii pahchaan, prakrutivarnan aadi kii drushti se shreshth nahin he
 There is a glut of narratives due to tradition and incorporating more and more embellishments
 chahal-pahal, nagarshobha, saajasja aadi ke varnan main inkaa man adhik rama he
 In the planning of dialogues, they have achieved particular success due to the incorporation of dramatic elements
 prabandhon kii apeksha muktakon main inaki saralata adhik sthalon par vyakt hui he
 Keshav was a court poet
 anya darbari kaviyon kii bhaanti unhone bhi apane ashrayadata raajaaon kaa yashogaan kiya he
 Veer Singh Dev Charit and Jahangir Jas Chandrika are his similar compositions
 keshav kaa doosraa rup acharya kaa he
 In kavi-priya and rasik-priya, he translated Sanskrit traits, texts and wrote his poems as an example
 ram chandrika kaa vishay ram-bhakthi he kintu keshav kavi pehle the, bhakt baad main
 Therefore, they have more of a performance of poetic-miracle than devotion
 vigyaan gita main keshav ne vairaygy se sambandhit bhaawanaaon ko vyakt kiya he
 Keshav did not remain in nature due to being in the decoration of the courts
 unka prakruti-chithran dosha-purna he
 There is more of the ruthlessness of tradition, less of originality and novelty
 varnan karne main kahin-kahin keshav ne kaal or sthaan kaa bhi dhyaan nahin rakhaa he
 Nature, burdened with ornaments, has lost its enduring beauty
 prakruti ke sambandh main keshav kii kalpanaaen kahin-kahin par badi asangat or aruchikar ho gai hai
 To make Arun Surya a blood-filled skull of Kapalika period would seem like a test
 darbari kavi hone ke kaaran keshav main rajdarbaron kii vakpatutaa vartmaan thi
 Hence, he had exceptional success in the planning of dialogues
 unke samvaad atyant aakarshak hai
 They have the same sentiment and courtesy as the courts
 unke dwaara charitron kaa uddhatan sundar dhang se hua he
 janaka-vishwamitra dialogues, luv-kusha dialogues, sita-hanuman dialogues are similar dialogues
 'angad-ravan-samvaad' ke antargat ek uttar-pratyuttar dekhie - Ravana- angad- Acharya Keshavdas was a great scholar
 atah unke kavy main kalpana or mastishk ko yoga adhik he
 His attention was not as much about erudition-performance
 paanditya-pradarshan kii isi pravriti ke kaaran kuch aalochakon ne keshav ko hriday-hin kavi kaha he, kintu yah aarope purnatah satya nahin, kyonki paanditya pradarshan ke saath-saath keshav ke kavy main aise anekanek sthal hai jahaan unki bhavukta or sahrudayatapurna saakaar ho uthi he
 In Ashoka Vatika, Hanuman ji gives Ramchandra ji's ring to Sita ji
 mudrika ke prati sita ji kaa kathan kitna bhavpurn he- Keshava made Brajbhasha the medium of his poetry, but the molded form of Brajbhasha found in poets of Sura etc
 Ashta Imprint is not in the poetry of Keshava
 keshav sanskrit ke prakand pandit the, atah unki bhashaa sanskrit se atyadhik prabhavit he
 He has adopted not only the corresponding words of Sanskrit, but also the variations of Sanskrit, in some places the language of his verses seems to be Sanskrit- keshav kii bhashaa main bundelkhandi bhashaa kaa bhi kaafii mishran miltaa he
 Bundeli words like Kharak, Thorilla, Dugai, Gaurmadine etc
 were used in his poetry
 avadhi bhashaa ke shabdon kaa bhi prayog miltaa he
 Such as here, here, show, show, etc
 keshav ne kahin-kahin to shabdon ko garh liya he
 Like - arc to arc
 aprachlit shabdon ke prayog main bhi unhone puri tarah svachhndatha se kaam liya
 Such as - light, launch, woman etc
 jal ke arth main vish shabd kaa prayog keshav kii bhashaa main hi miltaa he - Due to the immense influence of Sanskrit and Bundelkhandi, the use of obsolete words, long word-planning, etc
, Keshava's language has come to some degree of special illusion
 keshav kii bhashaa kaa saamaanya rup apekshaakrit sugam he
 Sayings and idioms have also been used in this place
 laaj maranaa kahawat kaa ek prayog dekhie - The impression of his personality on Keshav's style is clearly visible in this regard, he did not follow any of his former poets
 anek kaviyon kii kavitaaon ke bich unki kavita ko saralata se pahichaana ja saktaa he
