 adhiktar gaanvon or nagaron main paraspar saanskrithik aadan-pradaan bahut kam hota tha, kyonki yatayaat or sandeshvaahan ke saadhan bahut kam viksit the
 Thus political changes had little impact on the social status of the village
 vibhinn graamon or nagaron ke ek duusare se alag-alag rahane ke kaaran desh main kabhi akhil bhartiya raashtra kii bhaavana utpann nahin ho saki
 Whatever nationalism was felt in India, it was mostly a sense of religious and idealistic unity, not a sense of political and economic unity
 log tirthayatra karne ke liye purv se pashchim or uttar se dakshin bharat kaa daura avashya karte the or isse desh kii dharmik ekta kii bhaavana bani hui thi, kintu sampoorn desh paraspar sangharshrat chote-chote rajyon main banta hua tha, jiname baraabar yuddh hote rahete the
 On the other hand, rural societies were almost untouched by these political changes
 bhartiya samskruti mukhyarup se dharmik rahi he
 In this, political and economic values were never given as much importance as is given in modern culture
 bhartiya samskruti kii ekta bhi dharmik adarshavaadi ekta he
 Most of the lack of national feeling is visible in it
 bharat main angrejon kii vijay ke pashchaat bhartiya samaaj main vyapak roopaantaran hua
 The reason for the establishment of the British Empire was the decline of the Mughal Empire and the partition of the country into many small states
 british shashan purv-muslim shasno se anek baton main bhinn tha
 The British had a greater sense of nationality, discipline, patriotism and cooperation than the Indian people
 unke in gunon ne bhartiya vishisht varg ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 British rule had far-reaching effects on India's economic structure
 usase ek or desh main pracheen asin samaaj ko aghat pahunchaa or duusari ore paashchaatya samaaj kii sthapana hui
 This created political unity in the country
 uske prabhaav se desh main rashtriyata ke aandolan kaa vikaas hua
 This led to a complete change in the country's agricultural system
 angrejon ke aane se pehle bhoomi raja kii nahin samajhi jaati thi
 Used to tax the king who plowed it, the land of Astu was not even considered as private property
 angrejon ke aane se bhoomi par gramin samudaay kaa adhikaar nahin rahaa, balki vah vyaktiyon kii nijee sampatti ban gai
 In this way, in some parts of the country, landlords and farmers in other parts got the right to the land
 lard cornwalis ke rajyakaal main, bengal, bihar or urisa main jameendaar varg kaa udai hua
 This led to remote changes in the rural economy
 desh ke anya bhaagon main raiyatwari prabandh se kisaanon ko unke dwaara joti gai bhoomi par adhikaar de diya gaya
 Sir Tomas started the Ryotwadi system in 1820 as the Governor of Madras
 isse desh me vyapak, saamaajik, rajnatik saanskrithik or manovaigyanik parivartan hue
 In the new system of paying rent, not the rural panchayat, but the zamindars and farmers started paying taxes directly to the government
 is prakaar krishi vyavastha vyapaar kii sthiti main aa gai or paramparaagat bhartiya gramin vyavastha kaa vighatan hua
 The agricultural system began to change gradually
 bhoomi par nijee adhikaar sthapit hone se bhoomi ke chote-chote tukade badhane lage
 Farming was adversely affected by this erosion
 lagaan vasuul karne kii nai pranali se sarkari karmchaariyon ke naveen varg kaa nirmaan hua
 Those who have far-reaching political significance
 desh kii aarthik dasha bigadane lagi, garibi badhane lagi
 Debt increased in the villages, causing the land to go out of the hands of the cultivators respectively and into the hands of non-cultivators
 isse bhu-daason ke ek naveen varg kaa nirmaan hua, jiske hit bhu-swaamiyon ke hit ke viruddh the
 In the field of agriculture, proletarian land-slaves were formed on the one hand and altruistic zamindar class on the other side, in which mutual conflict and tension increased
 in virgon ke nirmaan se vyapak, saamaajik aarthik or rajnatik parivartan hue
 There were also extensive changes in the urban economy during the British rule
 kutir udyogon ko dhakka laga
 Their interests under foreign rule were disgraced, their consumption of goods decreased, leading to the end of traditional industries
 kaarigaron kaa saamaajik str girane laga or kaarigiri ke kaam chhodkar anya vyavsaayon lagane lage
 The consumption of indigenous goods started decreasing in the competition of ready-made goods from abroad, as a result of which India became the source of producing most of the raw materials and the markets of the country started to be filled with foreign goods
 is prishthbhumi desh main aadhunik udyogon ke vikaas me atyadhik mahatva he
 The British increased the means of transport and conveyance in the country for their benefit
 unhone naye-naye udyogon kii sthapana kii
 All this gradually aided in the development of a sense of nationality
 angreji padhe naye logo ne angrejon kii aarthik niti kii katu aalochana kii
 The capitalist class started to grow with the development of industries in the country
 adhiktar bhartiya udyogon main videshi poonji lagi hui thi
 Thus the economy of the country was harmful to the country and beneficial to the British, on the other hand their monopoly in the field of trade and industry increased
 angrejon ne desh main ek aise varg ke nirmaan ke liye angreji shiksha kaa prachaar kiya jo ki unhen shashan main sahaayta de saken
 Much of the education in pre-british India was religious education, which was imparted through Sanskrit schools and Muslim madrasas
 isaiyon ne desh main aadhunik shiksha kaa prachaar kiya, yadhyapi unki shiksha kaa ek uddeshy desh main isaiyon kii sankhya badhanaa bhi tha, kintu usase pashchimi tathaa aadhunikeekaran kii prakriyaaon ko bhi protsaahan mila
 In addition to general education, the British also opened schools to impart vocational education
 paashchaatya shiksha ke prabhaav se desh me ek aise vishisht varg kaa nirmaan hua jisane rashtriya shiksha kii ore dhyaan diya
 This class was well aware of the importance of education
 brahm samaaj, arya samaaj, ramakrishna mishan, aligarh aandolan ne bhi shiksha ko protsaahit kiya
 Kashi Hindu University and Muslim University were established in Aligarh
 desh main anek jagah dayanand aglo-vaidic vidyalayon or kalejon kii sthapana hui
 On the one hand, with the spread of English education, there was a rise of the class of black British who were Indian only by birth and in all respects, on the other hand, such educated classes were also created which were proud of the ancient traditions of the country
 inhen logon ne desh main rashtriya aandolan kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Whatever the criticism of the English education system in India, it is certain that it led to the national movement in the country
 usase rashtriyata, janatantravaad or samaajwaad kii lahar utpann hui
 Prior to the British, there was a complete lack of fundamental, political and administrative unity in India
 angrejon ne samast desh main rajnatik or prashasnic drushti se saamaanya vyavastha sthapit kii thi unhone apane rajya main kanoon ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 These laws were applied to every citizen of the state and to enforce them a complex judicial system was created in the country, the judges appointed by the state interpreted the laws
 or rajya ke adhiniyamon ko nagarikon par lagu karte the
 Lower courts, high courts and federal courts and councils were established all over the country
 jisaki apil privi council main kii ja sakati thi
 Thus the laws became more definite rather than based on customs
 kanoon kaa rajya sthapit hone se sthaneey panchayaton ke adhikaar kam ho gaye tathaa nyaay-vyavastha main ekarupata kii sthapana hui
 There is a huge difference in India and the English state legal system before the arrival of the British
 While the pre-british law was mostly based on religious motifs, the British law was based on the Act and democratic values of discrimination of caste, race, caste, gender
 Every citizen without state had equal rights
 is prakaar british shashan kaal main bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar desh kii janata main janatantreey aadhaar par ekta sthapit hui
 Apart from legal unity, administrative unity was also established in the British rule, in the city in which the administrative system of the province was one of a kind in the whole country
 lagaan kii vyavastha main vyapak parivartan hone se desh main bhoomi sambandhi kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana hui, jisamen bhoomi kray-vikray or rahan-sahan ke sambandh main samast desh main ek se kanoonon kaa prasar hua
 In the economic sector, the British government spread the coin from all over the country, in which there was an unprecedented increase in trade and purchase
 angrejon ke shasankaal main naveen saamaajik or aarthik vyavastha tathaa naveen prashasnic pranali or nai shiksha ke vistaar se nae virgon kaa udai hua
 These classes were not found in ancient Indian society
 ye angreji shasankaal main poonjivadi vyavastha se utpann hue
 But these new classes did not rise in the same way in different parts of the country
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main ek hi saath angreji shashan kii sthapana nahin hui or na unamem ek hi saath sudhaar lagu kiye gaye
 First the British rule was established in Bengal and from there the first landlord class was born
 isi prakaar bengal tathaa bombay main sabase pehle bade udyogon kii sthapana kii gai or vahaan par udyogpatiyon or shramikon ke virgon kaa nirmaan hua, ant main jab sampoorn desh me angreji shashan kii sthapana hui to sab jagah rashtriya str par nae saamaajik varg dikhalaai padane lage
 The former British social and economic structure had an important contribution in the creation of these new classes
 udhaaharan ke liye angrejon ke aane ke pehle baniyon main vyapaar or udyog adhik tha or angreji shasankaal main bhi inhen logon ne sabase pehle poonjipati varg kaa nirmaan kiya, hinduon kii tulana main muslim jansankhya me shiksha kaa prasar kam hone ke kaaran uname buddhijivi, madhyamvarg or burjua varg hindu samudaayon kii tulana main bahut baad main dikhalaai diya
 Thus, during the British rule, the zamindar class, land plowing, landlord, agricultural laborer, merchant class, moneylender, capitalist class, middle class, small merchant and shopkeeper class, doctors, lawyers, professors, managers, clerks, businessmen and so on
 The working class in various factories and gardens emerged
 inamen se anek virgon ke hit paraspar viruddh the or unhone apane-apane hiton kii raksha karne ke liye anek naveen aandolan chede
 The sprout of nationalist ideology began to grow in India from the middle of the seventeenth century, but it continued to develop slowly and finally it was completed in 1857 AD

 The national movement that started in India due to the birth of nationalism was a unique movement in the world itself, along with political awakening in India, social and religious awakening was also initiated

 Dr

 “the Indian national awakening in this way is different from the national awakening in European countries

 While these movements tried to remove the evils prevailing in another religion and society, on the other hand, India played an important role in preparing the land of nationalism

 Therefore, Dr

 Raja Rammohan Roy demanded political rights for Indians

 After 1707 AD, political unity had disappeared in India, but at the time of the British, the administration of almost the whole of India came under a central authority

 Due to the rule of the British Government over all India, India got tied into the thread of unity

 Western education made a commendable contribution to the Indian national stream
 1825 i0 me lard maikale ke suzav par bharat me shiksha kaa madhyam angreji bhashaa ko nishchit kiya
 Its main objective was to destroy the national consciousness of India at the root
 rajani palm dutt ne sahi likhaa he, "bharat main british shashan dwaara paashchaatya shiksha prarambh kiye jane kaa uddeshy yah tha ki bhartiya sabhyataa or samskruti kaa purnroop se lop ho jaae or ek aise varg kaa nirmaan ho jo rakt or varna se to bhartiya hon, kintu ruchi vichaar shabd or buddhi se angrej ho jaae
 "the British were also successful to this extent to a great extent, as educated Indians, forgetting their culture, started praising Western culture
 parantu paashchaatya shiksha se bharat ko haani kii apeksha laabh adhik hua
 This awakened the national consciousness in India, so western education proved to be a boon for India

 " Before the introduction of the English language, different languages were spoken in different provinces of India

 As a result, the spirit of Indian nationality became stronger day by day
 “ The summary is that western education proved to be a boon for India
 dow jakaaria ne thik hi likhaa he, ”angrejon ne 125 varsh purv bharat main shiksha kaa jo kaary armbh kiya tha, usase adhik hitkar or koi kaary unhone bharatvarsh main nahin kiya he

 Indian literature and newspapers were also instrumental in the progress and development of the national movement

 In those days newspapers were published in various languages in India, in which political rights were demanded

" “ bhartiya rashtriyata par yah baat puri utarati he
 The British government's policy of economic exploitation had completely destroyed Indian industries
 yahan ke vyapaar par angrejon kaa purna adhikaar ho gaya tha
 Indian goods, which went out, were heavily taxed and the British government gave a great discount on imports for goods coming into India
 iske atirikt angrej bharat se kaccha maal le jate the, england se mashiinon dwaara nirmit maal bharat main bhejte the, jo laghu evam kutir udyog dhandhon ke nirmit maal se bahut sasta hota tha
 As a result, Indian markets were filled with European goods and due to the collapse of cottage industry businesses, millions of people became unemployed
 bharat kaa dhan videshon main ja rahaa tha atah bharat din-pratidin nirdhan hota gaya
 Therefore, in 1880, Sir William Digvi wrote that there are about ten million human beings in British India, who do not get any food at any time, the second example of this degeneration can not be seen anywhere else in a more prosperous country at this time
 Regarding the economic condition of Indians, the Duke of Agali, who was the Secretary of India in 1875
76, wrote, "the poorness of the people of India and the standard of living that it is falling on

 E
 Covenant has written about the exploitation of Indians, “the economic condition of Indians deteriorated more during the British rule
 chaar karod bharatiyon ko keval din main khaanaa khaakar santusht rahanaa padataa tha
 The only reason for this was that England also used to receive taxes from hungry farmers and made profit by sending their goods there

 She wanted to be free from this exploitation
 isliye bharatiyon ne rashtriya aandolan main sakriyarup se bhaag lenaa prarambh kar diya
 In the words of Gurmukh Nihal Singh "the fact cannot be denied that the deteriorating economic condition and the government's anti-national economic policy had a lot of hand in awakening anti-british ideology and national sentiment
 “ After the revolt of 1857, the British rulers adopted the policy of caste differentiation
 is niti ke anusaar ve bharatiyon ko ghrinaa kii drushti se dekhne lage
 According to Gurmukh Nihal Singh, “the British who came to India after the rebellion had different perceptions about indians
according ve manch ke tatkaaleen daasya chitron ke anusaar bharatiyon ko aisa jantu samajhate the jo aadha vanamaanush or aadha nigro tha, jise keval bhay dwaara hi samajhaayaa ja saktaa tha or jiske liye jaranal nil tathaa uske saathiyon kaa ghrinaa or aatank kaa vyavhaar hi upyukt tha
 " 1857 ke vidroh ke baad angrejon ne sampark kam kar diya
 Their habitat was completely different from that of Indians

 In hotels, clubs, parks etc
, the British used to mistreat Indians
 is kaaran angrejon ne rang bhed kii niti ke aadhaar par bharatiyon par anek atyaachaar kiye
 Garrett wrote in this regard, "the caste differentiation policy of Europeans was based on three important principles

 One issue of Amrit Bazar Patrika mentions three incidents in which the killers did not get full legal punishment
 europiyanon ke mukadmon main shaharon se jeuri bulaae jate the
 The arrogance of being the winning caste is highest among them, their moral sense does not allow that an Englishman has to give his life in the crime of killing an Indian
 " This caste discrimination policy of the British had a very bad effect on Indians
 ab unke hriday main british shashan ke prati vidroh kii jwaala bhadak uthi
 This fact communicated the feeling of nationalism at a rapid pace
 garret ne sahi likhaa he, ”bhartiya rashtriyata kii badhottaree main uparokt katutaa kii bhaavana ek bahut bada kaaran thi
 " 1833 i0 ke charter adhinium or 1858 i0 kii maharani victoria kii ghoshnaa main kaha gaya tha ki sarkari naukariyon main niyukti keval yogyata ke aadhaar par hi kii jaaegi
 There will be no discrimination between Indians and Europeans, but in practice it was dissolved rather than following this policy
 angreji shiksha ke kaaran, vakil, doctor or adhyaaapak tathaa naukari karanevaalon kaa ek varg utpann hua
 After the Revolt of 1857, the British government lost faith in Indians
 atah ve padhe likhe bharatiyon ko sarkari naukari nahin dena chaahati thi, isliye unamem asantosh badhaa
 Efforts were made to keep Indians special from the higher posts and separate from 'indian Civil Service'
 is seva me pravesh kii aayu 21 varsh thi
 It was tested in English in England
 kisi bhi bhartiya dwaara aisi pariksha ko paas karnaa atyant kathin tha
 Despite this, if an Indian was successful, he would not have been employed in some sort of excuse
 udhaahranswaroop 1869 i0 main shri surendra nath bannerjee ne ICS kii pariksha paas kar lee parantu british sarkaar ne seva main pravesh karne ke baad bhi maamuli-si galati par unhen naukari se hataa diya tha
 Similarly, in 1871 AD, Arvind Ghosh passed this examination
 parantu unki niyukti nahin kii gai, kyonki ve ghode kii sawari main praveen nahin the
 British officials used to search for new excuses to deprive Indians of high positions
 san 1871 i0 me ICS main pravesh kii aayu 21 varsh se ghataakar 19 varsh kar di gai, taaki bhartiya is pratiyogita main bhaag na le saken
 Surendra Nath Banerjee founded the Indian Association in 1876 to protest against British injustice, which can be called the previous institution of Congress
 banerjee ne is kaary kaa virodh karne ke liye evam rashtriya janamat ko jaagrit karne hetu sampoorn desh kaa bhraman kiya
 This encouraged the anti-british movement
 shri banerjee ne apni aatmakatha me likhaa he ki ”mere maamalon ne bharatiyon ke hriday me baari kshobh utpann kar diya, unamem yah vichaar fail gaya ki yadi main bhartiya na hota to mujhe itani kathinaaiyaan nahin uthaani padati
 " yatayaat tathaa sanchaar ke sadhano ke vikaas main bhi rashtriya aandolan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 The British government set up a network of railways and roads in the country
 dak, taar, telephone aadi kii vyavastha hui
 The main objective of the British government was that English forces would be sent quickly to suppress the rebellion, and information would be received from far off provinces soon
 is vikaas se bharatiyon ko kaaphi laabh hua
 Now it became easy for them to move from one place to another
 desh ke bhinn-bhinn bhaagon me rahanevaale logon ke bich duuri kam ho gai, ve ek duusare ke nikat aane lage
 His subsequent contact grew and his outlook broadened

 It became easier for nationalists to meet and correspond
 ab ve ek sthaan se duusare sthaan kaa bhraman kar aandolan ko or adhik ugr banane lage, jinase jan saadhaaran main jagriti ai
 As a result, the spirit of unity became stronger and the national movement gained strength

 majumdaar ne likhaa he ki 19veen shatabdi me europe main jo swadhinata sangram lade gaye, unhone bhi bhartiya rashtriya aandolan ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya
 The French Revolution of 1830 and 1848 brought a sense of sacrifice among Indians
 italy tathaa yunaan kii swadhinata ne unke utsaah main asaadhaaran vruddhi kii
 Ireland was also trying to be free from the subjugation of the British, this also affected the Indian public greatly
 italy, germany, rumania or servia ke raajnneetik aandolan, england me sudhaar kanoonon kaa paarit hona evam america kaa swatantrata sangram aadi ne bhi bharatiyon ko utsahit kiya tathaa unamem saahas paidaa kiya
 As a result, they started fighting for independence
 saransh yah he ki videshi aandolanon ne bharatiyon me desh bhakthi or desh prem kii bhaavana ko viksit karne me mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Lord Litton's reactionary policy led to national discontent
 parinamswaroop bharat main rashtriyata kii bhaavana kaa janm hua
 This fact is confirmed by Surendra Nath Banerjee's statement, "sometimes bad rulers are helpful in the development of political progress
 lard litan ne shikshit samudaay main us seemaa tak nae jivan kii lahar phunk di
 Which was not possible with many years of movement
 “ lard litan ne bharat main nimna atyaachaar kieh As a result of these actions of Lord Lytton, the Indian public became very angry towards the British rule
 sar wiliam baderbern ne blant se kaha tha “lord litan ke shasankaal ke ant main sthiti vidroh kii seemaa tak pahunch gai thi
 " 1880 i0 main lord litan ke sthaan par lord ripan governor general banakar aae
 He made many reforms in various areas of administration
 iske pashchaat nyaay vyavastha main sudhaar karne kaa nishchay kiya
 At this time, caste discrimination existed in the field of justice
 bhartiya nyayadhishon ko european aparaadhiyon ke abhiyog kii sunwaayee kaa adhikaar praapt nahin tha, jabaki angrej nyayadhishon ko yah adhikaar praapt tha
 So Ripon asked his council of law member, MCP Ilbert, to submit a special bill in this regard, on which Ilbert introduced a bill in 1883, it is called the Ilbert Bill
 isamen bhartiya magistriton ko europiyanon ke viruddh abhiyog kii sunwaayee karne or dandit karne ke adhikaar dene kii vyavastha thi
 But this bill became a fierce controversy
 bharat main rahanevaale angrejon ne ilbert vidhyek ko apana jaateey apmaan samajha
 As a result, the British all over India and England organized and opposed it and launched a movement against it
 unhone kaha, “kaale log goron ko lambi-lambi sajaayen denge tathaa unki striyon ko apane ghar main rakhenge
 "the Europeans set up a 'european Defense Association' to collectively launch a movement against this bill and collected about one lakh fifty thousand rupees
 vidheyak kii ninda karne hetu vividh sthanon par sabhaayen yojit kii gai
 Opposition to the bill reached its climax
 sar henry watan ne is sambandh main likhaa he ki “kalkatte ke kuch angrejon ne sarkari bhawan ke santariyon ko vash main karke lord ripan ko band kar vaapis england bhejne kaa shadyantr rachaa or yah sab bengal ke governor tathaa police kamishnar kii jaankaree main hua” angrejon ke sangathit aandolan ke samaksh ripan ko jhukna padaa or use is vidheyak main sanshodhan karnaa padaa
 Accordingly, it has now been decided that Indian judges and session judges will be able to give their verdict on the cases of European authorities
 kintu ye european adhikari apane mukaddamon main jeuri baithne kii maang kar sakenge
 Of which at least half of the members will be Europeans
 is sanshodhan se is vidheyak kii mul bhaavana hi samaapt ho gai
 This incident greatly affected the Indian public
 surendranath bannerjee ke shabdon main “koi bhi swabhimani bhartiya ab aankh muundakar sust nahin baitha rah saktaa tha
 For those who understood the importance of the Ilbert controversy, it was a great call to patriotism
 ” vastav main ilbert bill ke virdohi aandolan ne bharat ko sangathit karne ke liye prerit kiya
 In the words of Sir Henry Cotton, "the European Movement opposed to this Bill provided as much unity to the national ideology of India as the Bill could not have passed
" ” europiyanon ke aandolan se prabhavit hokar bharatiyon ne bhi rashtriya sanstha ke gathan kaa nishchay kiya
 As a result, the way for the establishment of Congress was paved
 bharatiyon ne mahasoos kiya ki yadi ham bhi angrejon kii bhanti sangathit hokar british sarkaar kaa virodh karen, to hame swadhinata praapt ho sakati he
 This gave a boost to the national movement
 shri e si majumdaar likhte hai, “is aandolan ne bharatiyon ko yah bhi anubhav kara diya ki yadi raajnneetik pragati vaanchhneeya he, to keval ek rashtriya sabha dwaara hi sambhav he
 This gathering should not be related to the independent politics of the different provinces but to a broader politics of the country
 ” Analyzing the reasons for the birth of nationalism, it becomes clear that it was born in India as a result of the policies of the British government
 bharat main british samrajyavad ke do virdohi drushtikon saamne aate hai- vikasvaadi or pratikriyaavaadi
 But both these forms helped in the birth of nationalism
 jaisaa ki uparyukt varnan se spasht he british shashan main hi bharat main raajnneetik ekta sthapit hui, paashchaatya shiksha kaa prasar hua or yatayaat ke sadhano kaa vikaas hua
 If on one hand, British rule benefited from them, on the other hand it also contributed to the birth of nationalism in an unintentional way
 british shashan ke vikasshil swaroop ne yadi rashtrawaad ke janm ke liye apratyakshrup se yogadan kiya to uske pratikriyaavaadi swaroop ne is prakriya ko tej kiya
 Economic exploitation of India by British rule, discrimination with Indians, denial of place in government jobs, strangulation of the press, keeping arms or prohibiting movement
 samrajyavad ke vistaar ke liye yuddh ladanaa jaise kaamon ne yah spasht kar diya ki british shashan bharat ke hit main nahin he
 Most national leaders were of the opinion that the root cause of India's economic plight is British rule in India

 Water cycles or water turbines are rotational engines that convert the kinetic energy contained in a flowing water into mechanical work
 inkaa aadhunik vikaas 19veen shatabdi main hua tathaa vidyut grid ke aane ke pehle tak ve audyogic shakti ke liye bahutayat main prayog kii jaatin thi
 At present, they are mainly used for generating electricity
 panchakkiyaan vibhinn prakaar se banaai jane par bhi badi hi saral prakaar kii yuktiyaan hai jinka prayog pragaitihaasik kaal se hi shakti utpaadan karne ke liye hota chalaa aayaa he
 Inspired by the requirements and circumstances from time to time, people made many improvements in them, so water turbine is also an evolved form of watermill
 beesvin shatabdi ke purvardh se to inkaa itnaa upyog bad gaya he ki inke dwaara lagbhag sabhi sabhy deshon main jagah jagah, chote bade anek jal-vidyut shakti-grih banaae jane lage
 Due to this, electricity started to be received at a very cheap price even in remote waterless villages and the development of various types of industrial businesses was encouraged
 jin siddhanton ke aadhaar par in sanyantron kii abhiklpana kii jaati he, ve sabhi prakaar ke pratham chaalak yantron main lagu hote hai
 To understand briefly how the kinetic energy of the potential energy contained in a water sign changes, imagine that a stream of water is falling from a tank at some height into the reservoir below it
 is tank main bhare prati kilogram pani main, oonchaai ke kaaran kuch jul sthitij urja nihit he
 When this water falls down, this potential energy starts converting into kinetic energy respectively and when that current reaches the bottom of the reservoir, all its potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy
 is jal-tal-rekha tak pahonchte samay yadi us ek kilogram pani kaa veg v meter prati senkad ho to usamen 0
5 V2 jul gatij urja hogi
 If the height of the tank is assumed to be h m, then there will be gh joule potential energy per kilogram of water in the tank
 at: neeche pahunchne par
 Loss of potential energy = attainment of kinetic energy, that is, as soon as that water enters the reservoir, there will be disturbance in its water and then it will calm down in a while
 is udhaaharan main, upar se aanevaale pani main nihit gatij urja jalashay ke pani main vikshobh utpann karke hi barabaad ho gai or usase koi upyogi kaary nahin ho sakaa
 If the same water came down through a tap, it could generate pressure at the mouth of that tap and run any water cycle or engine
 jab bhi kisi sthaan par jal ke pravaah athwa varchas dwaara praapt urja kii sahaayta se koi jalchaalit motor yaa tarabine chalaakar shakti unpaadan karne kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he, to uske pehle aas paas main sthit jalarashi athwa jalsroton se praapt hone vaali urja kaa yathasadhay sahi anumaan laga liya jaataa he
 The history of water mills is very old
 saath hi, pani kaa urja ke taur par istemaal bhi kaaphi arase se ho rahaa he
 Even the Romans once used turbine water mills for agriculture
 is tarah tarabine water wheel kii prakritik rup se viksit takanic he
 However, the modern turbine did not develop until the Industrial Revolution took place
 aitihaasik taur par dekhen to 19veen sadi main yah badi-badi factoriyon main istemaal hota tha
 This classification is as follows: ye chakra jaldhara ke pravaah main rukaawat daalane par holevaale sanghatt ke kaaran athwa chakra kii dolchiyon main bhare pani ke bhaar ke kaaran chalaa karte hai
 The flow of water stream and the use of gravity-driven cycles are now considered suitable for cottage industries in the countryside, especially in the mountainous provinces where waterfalls are constantly flowing
 is prakaar ke chakron main ad:pravaahee, ponsle, madhyapravahee or urdhvapravahee chakra pramukh hai, lekin badi maatra main vidyudutpaadan ke liye ye sarvatha anupyukt samajhe jate hai, phir bhi sahaayak motor ke rup main, bade bijligharon main, urdhvapravahee chakra kaa upyog, aavashyaktaa padane par, aadhunik sanyantron ke saath kar liya jaataa he
 The efficiency of this type of cycle is only about 25 percent, because a lot of water energy is wasted in it
 1,800 i0 tak iskaa upyog bahut hua karata tha
 It is a sophisticated form of the semipolar cycle
 isaki pankhudiyaan is prakaar se modakar golaaidaar banaai jaati hai ki inamen pani bina jhatka maare hi pravesh kar jaataa he or unamem se baahar nikalate samay vah chakra kii paridhi kii sparsharekhiy disha main hokar hi nikalataa he, jise chakra ko adhik aaveg praapt ho jaataa he or chakra kii kaaryakshmata lagbhag dugani ho jaati he
 This is also the refined form of the inflow cycle
 isaki konianuma pankhudiyon main pani, chakra kii dhuree ke tal se kuch oonchaai par sthit pankhudiyon main bharna aarambh hota he or unke neeche aane tak unhon main bharaa rahata he
 The shell of the cycle also helps in keeping this water filled with them, so this cycle rotates mainly due to the weight of water
 madhyapravahee chakra bhi do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is the mid-flow, as shown in the above mentioned picture and the other is called the mid-flow
 isaki pankhudiyon main pani dhuree ke tal se kuch neeche kii pankhudiyon main bharna aarambh hota he, jisamen pani ke bhaar or pravaahajanit, donon prakaar kii, urjaaon kaa upyog hota he
 The efficiency of these chakras can range from 50 per cent to 80 per cent, depending on their texture and size
 inkaa prayog 19veen shatabdi ke madhya tak hota rahaa, phir band ho gaya
 Its efficiency ranges from 70 percent to 85 percent, which is almost equivalent to modern water turbines
 It is a relatively modern type of gravitational energized water cycle, which is still used today as an auxiliary motor to generate small amounts of electricity
 Is and gives good work
 ye kisi tung main se nikalanevaale jal kii atyadhik vegayukt pradhar kii gatij urja dwaara chalate hai
 This type of impulse is used only where the quantity of water is limited but its dominance is from 300 to 3,000 feet high
 aadhunik prakaar ke aaveg chakra ponsle ke ad:pravaahee chakra ke parishkrut rup hai
 In these, the trusses are used in place of the sluice route, of which the water stream rises from the big baig and collides with the petals of the wheel
 is dhang ke jis sanyantr kaa sarvaadhik prachaar he vah peltan chakra ] ] ke naam se prasiddh he
 The dolchi is made as two twin cups in such a way that the water stream explodes as soon as it collides in the middle, splitting into two, moving at an angle of about 180 degrees from each other
 yadi ye donon uppradharaen apni mul pradhara se bilkul vipareet disha main bah nikle to avashya hi peltan chakra kii kaaryakshmata 100 prati shat ho jaay, lekin inhen jaan boojhkar tirachha karke nikaala jaataa he, jisase ye apane pasavali dolchi se takaraayen nahin
 By doing this, some energy is wasted in friction, due to which the efficiency of this cycle remains about 80 percent
 in tundon main pravesh karte samay, baahar nikalate samay kii apeksha, pani kaa veg bahut adhik hota he
 Hence, their path is widened outwards
 sanyukt rajya, america main is tarabine kaa nirmaan 'victor ucchdaab tarabine' naam se kiya jaataa he, jisaki dakshata 70 pratishat se lekar 80 pratishat tak, uske dizin tathaa aakaar ke anusaar hoti he
 In this, both the kinetic energy and pressure of water are used
 ye vahiin lagaae jate hai jahaan paristhitiyaan aavegchakra tathaa aaveg tarabinon ke liye bataai paristhitiyon se vipareet hoti hai, arthath jahaan pani alp varchas yukt hote hue bhi vipul maatra main praapt ho saktaa he
 This water can be dominated from 5 to 500 feet
 pratikriya tarabine ] kaa siddhant bhaap tarabine ke lekh main samajhaayaa gaya he
 In the impulse cycle, only the kinetic energy of water works, but both reactive and pressurized energies in the reactive cycle work together
 bagichon main pani chhidakane kaa ghoomanevaala phuhaaraa dekha hoga
 Scratch mills and Warker mills were built on this principle, which were reactive turbines of primitive type
 pratikriyaatmak tarabine pani ke pravaah ke dishanusaar nimnlikhit chaar mukhya virgon main baanti ja sakati hai - a French engineer named Fernéron created the guiding trunks to be in a radial direction to flow outward from the central waterway, according to Barker Mill's principle, with their outward petalled circle,] isamen pa kendriya kaksh he, jisamen pani pravisht hokar traigy disha main pha chihnit tund main jaakar chakra kii ba chihnit pankhons ko ghumata hua baahar nikal jaataa he
 It has a central axle, which is related to dynamo etc
 yah traigy bahirpravahee tarabine kaa namoona he
 ] iskaa abhikalp je0 bi0 fransis naamak suvikhyath american ejeeniyar ne banaaya tha
 In this, the water from the springs enters the radial direction from the outside, moves inward by moving the wings moving near the center, the bottom being around the spindle, exits
 tarabinon kaa ghoomanevaala chakra jisaki paridhi par dolchiyaan athwa pankh lage hote hai, 'dhaavak' kehalaata he
 This is the main component of turbines, whose efficiency and strength depend on the fine texture and balance
 do prakaar ko tarabine praaia: adhik kaam aati hai, ek to traigy ant:pravaahee pratikriyaatmak or duusari aavegatmak
 The first type is the Francis turbine, which is suitable for 100 to 500 feet of dominated water
 aavashyaktaa padane par 600 foot varchas ke jal kaa bhi inke saath upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 For impulsive turbines, Pelton has a double-barreled baffle, whose ellipses have elliptical surface and the outer edges are slightly cut
 inamen pani kii pradhar bina jhatka maare inhen dhakelkat bilkul saaf baahar nikal jaati he or kate kinare ke kaaran chaalu karte samay pradhar kii shakti vicchhinn nahi hone paati
 The spinning wheel of alluvial turbines is the refined form of turbine turbines
 iskaa abhikalp alp varchas ke jal se teevr gati tathaa adhik shakti praapt karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 According to the rules of mechanics, the diameter of the wheel has to be reduced for high speed, but in doing so it reduces its power; Therefore, to eliminate this defect, its width has also been increased by reducing its diameter and the number of wings has been reduced to near the center
 inkaa prayog 5 se lekar 150 foot varchas tak ke pani ke saath kiya ja saktaa he
 The ability of the rushes is tested by their characteristic movements
 yadi ham kisi dhavanchakra kii vibhinn naapon ko itnaa chota tathaa sankuchit karte jaayan ki vah ek foot varchas ke jal se itane chakkar prati minute lagane lage ki usase ek ashwashakti mil jaae to chakkaron kii us sankhya ko us chakra kii lakshanik chaal kehete hai
 They are still used in rural areas to produce small amounts of power
 inke ekahare chakra kaa vyas 60 foot tak bana diya jaataa he tathaa uski chaudaai itani rakhi jaati he ki vah 3,000 ghan foot pani prati minute se chalaa sake
 They run at a sufficiently slow speed, so they are made of whole steel sheets and rolled rods
 chakron kii bhitari paridhiyon par daante bana die jate hai, jinase ek taraf laga hua chota dantachakr ghumkar apane se sambandhit dhuree dwaara yantron ko chalaata he
 The instruments are often not operated from their central main axle, because the torsion force on them causes too much fear of their release
 kisi bhi jal tarabine kii saidhantik ashwashakti usapar prati minute giranevaale pani ke bhaar tathaa jitani oonchaai se vah girtaa he uske gunanfal ke anupaat se jaani ja sakati he
 For example, if the volume of water coming on the turbine per second through the sluice route is v cubic meter, the density of water is d and that water is dominated by h meter, then its theoretical power will be Vdgh
 kisi chaalak yantra kii kaaryakshmata uski saidhantik shakti or vaastavik pradutt shakti kaa anupaat samajhi jaati he
 The provided horsepower is also known as insulation or brake ashpower; Thus, efficiency of a water turbine = HP / BHP
 The efficiency of today's huge water turbines is more than 90%

 inamen paraspar dwesh or katutaa thi or paksh or upapaksh the jinaki prerana se anek shadyantr, viplav, vishwasghaat aadi ghrunit kaary karwaae ja rahe the
 Therefore, Nana Fadnavis had to carry out the work of the Sangh with great foresight and diplomacy and the burden of bringing order within the state also fell on him
 sabhi sardaar peshwa ko apana netaa maanate the
 But after the third battle of Panipat, the control of the Peshwa began to become very relaxed
 saath hi peshwa ke uttaradhikaar ke sambandh main matbhed or aapasi shadyantr bhi chal rahe the
 So Nana had to solve two problems simultaneously
 at: apane swabhimaan kii raksha karte hue naanaa ne peshwa kii, tathaa maratharajya kii raksha kii, tathaa maratha sangh ko vichhin hone se bachaaya
 The British wanted to increase their empire, but Nana fought the enemy of the Marathas from the British year after year to win the Peshwa kingdom in addition to Sashti

 The film stars Karan Singh Grover, Zareen Khan, and Sharman Joshi in the lead roles
 yah film 4 disambar 2015 ko cinemagharon main pradarshit hui
 The story begins with a very wealthy businessman Aditya Dewan and his wife Siya Dewan
 vah donon ek vikram dewan naam se ek aspataal kaa udghaatan karte hai
 After that an unknown person Sourav Singhania gives him a car as a gift and also invites him to a party
 yahan vah aditya ko vyapaar hetu sahaayta main bahut paise dene or uske badale main uski patni ko ek raat saath rahane ke liye kahata he
 Aditya rejects his offer
 iske baad saurav use barbaad karne kaa prayaas karata he
 He speaks of those working there in Aditya's factory mixing pesticides in cola
 is kaaran aditya ko use band karnaa padataa he
 Aditya puts all the blame on Kaya, who works in his own company and removes him from his job
 iske baad saurav ke saath kaaya bhi aa jaati he or badla lene main uski madad karti he
 Sourav asks her for confidential information about Aditya's business
 kaaya is tarah dikhaati he ki use saurav se pyaar ho gaya he
 But later it is revealed that Kaya is still working for Aditya and betraying Sourav
 saurav bhi use juthi kahani sunaata he ki uski bahan aditya ke kaaran aatmahatya kar lee thi
 One day Aditya gives Kaya a lot of money to take to a leader, so that he can benefit in business
 saurav is bare main iskar vibhaag ko bataa detaa he, jisase aditya ko bahut bada nuksaan hota he or vah apane aap ko besahaara mahasoos karne lagata he
 He then tells Kaya to talk to Aditya and not to work for him, etc
 kaaya jab aditya ko phone kar ye baat bataati he ki vah uske liye ab koi kaam nahin karegi
 At the same time, Saurav records it
 uske kuch hi samay baad vah kaaya ko galaa dabaakar maar detaa he or uskaa aarope aditya par laga detaa he
 Sourav hides the recorded evidence of that phone so that the police can find it easily
 sabhi saboot aditya ke khilaaf ho jate hai or use jail ho jaati he
 Siya is unable to see him in this condition and goes to find evidence of Aditya's innocence in exchange for one night of sleep from Sourav
 us raat vah saurav ke kandhe main us nishaan ko dekh kar aashcharya main pad jaati he
 Because that mark also resides in the shoulder of Vikram, Aditya's elder brother
 iske baad kahani kuch peeche chale jaati he or is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki aditya or siya ne mil kar vikram ko maar daalaa tha
 So that we can grab all his money
 uske baad siya ko ehsaas hota he ki saurav hi vikram he jo badla lene ke liye waapas aayaa he
 Sourav then states that he will have to sign the paper to prove Aditya innocent
 jisase sara paisa use waapas mil sake
 After this, Siya agrees to him and Aditya is freed from jail
 jail se nikalne ke baad aditya or siya donon apane ek or jaaydaad ki ore jate hai, jisamen un log apana paisa lagaae rahete hai
 Saurav also arrives there and is followed by a fight between Aditya and Saurav
 uske baad aditya or siya ko saurav maar detaa he
 In the end it is revealed that Sourav is not Vikram, but his friend Karan
 vikram hawaii jahaaj ke durghatana ke kaaran chal nahin paata he
 After this, his best friend Karan thinks of avenging his condition
 iske baad aspataal main vikram aata he or karan se bolta he ki vah uskaa sach main bhai he

 Panini has been the most famous and respected grammarian of Sanskrit
 unka granth ashtaadhi sanskrit vyakaran kaa sabase pratishthit granth he
 Among the earlier grammars of Panini, Yask, Shaktaayan, Shaunak, Shakalya, Sphotayan, etc
 have taken place
 panini ke parvarti vaiyakarnon main katyayan muni, patanjali muni aadi shaamil hai
 Katyayan Muni wrote commentaries in commentary in about 350 BC
 tatpashchaat patanjali muni ne 150 i pus ke lagbhag ashtaadhi par mahabhashya naam se bhashya likhaa
 In grammar, Panini, Katyayana and Pantajali have been called Trimuni or Munitriya

 Madhyasiddhantakoumudi was composed on the style of Siddhanta Kaumudi and Varadaraja composed the Minoriddhantakamoudi keeping some essential rules in mind
 baad main vyakaran ke darshan paksh par anek granth likhe gayi
 Around 600 CE, Bhartrihari wrote the phrase
 iske atirikt inaki mahabhashyadipika bhi vyakaran kaa mahatvapurn granth he
 In the same tradition, Vayakaranas Bhushanasar of Kaundabhatta circa 1650 AD and Vyakaranasiddha Siddhanta Manjusha of Nageshbhat circa 1700 AD are famous
 panini kii ashtaadhi parampara ke atirikt bhi kuch aacharyon ke naam se vyakaran sampradaay prachlit huye
 Among these, Katantra, Chandra, Shaktaayan, Ham, Saraswat and Saupadma are prominent

 Steganography, the secret message is the art and science of writing in such a way that no one other than the sender and intended recipient doubts about the existence of the message, which is a safeguard through ambiguity
 stegnographi shabd multah greek bhashaa kaa he, jiskaa arth he "prachhann lekhan" 
 is shabd kaa pehla abhilikhit prayog, 1499 main johans trithimius dwaara apni pustak stegnographia main darj miltaa he, jo ki jaadu kii pustak ke rup main prachhann, kryptographi or stegnographi par shodh-prabandh tha
 Typically, messages exist in another way: pictures, articles, shopping lists, or some other co-text and, ideally, cryptic messages, may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter
 stegnographi kaa akele kryptographi kii tulana main laabh yah he ki sandesh apni ore dhyaan aakarshith nahin karte
 spashtatah dikhaai dene vaale kutabaddh sandesh-chaahe kitne hi atoot kyon naa ho-andeh jagaayenge or un deshon main khud hi funs sakate hai, jahaan incripshan avaidh he
 Therefore, where cryptography preserves the content of a message, steganography can be said to be the protector of both the message and the communicating party
 stegnographi main computer filon ke bheetar soochna kaa chhipav bhi shaamil he
 In digital steganography, electronic communication may involve steganographic signaling inside a transport layer such as a documentary file, image file, program, or protocol
 apane bade aakaar ke kaaran stegnographic sancharan ke liye media fil adarsh hai
 As a simple example, a sender can start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every 100th pixel to correspond to the letter of the alphabet, where the change may be so subtle that it is not noticeable to the viewer
 The eye is not likely to fall on him

 Steganography has been widely used in recent historical and present times
 sambhav kram-parivartan antaheen hai or gyaat udaahranon main shaamil hai: Modern steganography entered the world in 1985, with the advent of the use of personal computers for installed steganography problems

 Digital steganography techniques include: digital stegnographi output, mudrit dastavejon ke rup main ho saktaa he
 a message may be encrypted first in a traditional way, producing plain text, a cipher text
 phir, ek ahaanikar sah-paath kisi tarah sanketakshron ke rup main sanshodhit ho jate hai, jiske parinamswaroop stego-paath banataa he
 For example, alphanumeric, spacing, typefaces, or other features of co-text can be manipulated to hide the message
 keval vahi praptakarta jo takanic jaanata he, sandesh paa saktaa he or phir use dicript kar saktaa he
 Francis Bacon developed such a technique as the Bacon Abbreviations
 saamanytah, paaramparik radio or sanchaar praudyogiki ke adhik anuroop kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; tathaapi, kuch aise shabdon kaa sankshipt vivaran dena uchit hoga, jo software main vishesh rup dikh jate hai or aasaani se bhramit karte hai
 These are more relevant for digital steganographic systems
 pelod vah data he jiskaa parivahan vaanchhneeya he
 The carrier is the signal, stream, or data file in which the payload is hidden; "channel" in contrast
 parinami sanket, dhara, yaa data fil, jisamen ki pelod encoded he, kabhi-kabhi package, stego fil, yaa gupt sandesh ke rup main nirdisht hota he
 The percentage of bytes, samples, or other signal elements used to change the payload is known as an encoding density, and is usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1
 filon ke ek set main, pelod shaamil hone kii sambhaavna vaale filon ko saspects kaha jaataa he
 If the spec is identified through a statistical analysis, it can be cited as a candidate
 bhautik stegnographi kaa pataa lagane ke liye dhyanpurvak bhautik pareekshan kii zarurat he, jisamen aavardhan, develper rasayan or parabangnee prakaash kaa upyog shaamil he
 It takes longer and there are obvious resource implications, even in countries where large numbers of people are employed to spy on their fellow citizens

 During World War II, a technique used to facilitate pow's postal surveillance involved specially processed paper, with invisible ink appearing
 paper trade jarnal ke 24 june 1948 ke ank main prakashit ek lekh main sanyukt raashtra sarkari mudranalay ke takneekee nideshak morris es
 kaantrovitz, is kaagaz ko viksit karne ke sambandh main varnit karte hai, jiske teen prototipon ko sencikot, anilith or kotlith naam diya gaya
 The manufacture of these postal cards and stationery was to be given to German war prisoners in the US and Canada
 yadi POW koi sandesh chipa kar likhane kaa prayaas karte, to vishesh kaagaz use drishy rup main prastut kar degaa
 At least two US patents related to this technology were approved, by Mr
 Kantrowitz, no
 2,515,232, for "water-sensitive paper and its corresponding water-sensitive coating composition" patented on 18 July 1950 and earlier for "moisture-sensitive paper and manufacturing thereof", patented on 20 July 1948

 The discovery of stagnographically encoded packages in computing is called steganoanalysis
 tathaapi, sanshodhit filon kaa pataa lagane kaa saral tarika he, gyaat mul ke saath unki tulana
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek website par graphix ke madhyam se soochna kii gatishiltaa kaa pataa lagane ke liye, vishleshak in samagriyon ke gyaat-svachh pratiyon kaa anurakshan kar sakate hai or site par maujuuda saamagree ke saath unki tulana kar sakate hai
 The difference would create the payload assuming the carriers are the same
 saamaanya taur par, atyadhik ucch sampeedan dar kaa upyog, stegnographi ko mushkil kar detaa he, par asambhav nahin
 Where compression errors provide data hiding space, high compression reduces the amount of data available to hide payloads, increasing encoding density and allowing easier detection
 stegnographi kaa upyog HP or Xerox brands ke rangeen leisure printer samet kuch aadhunik printeron dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Small yellow dots are included in each page
 ye bindu mushkil se dikhaai dete hai or inamen encoded printer serial number, saath hi saath dinaank or samay kii muhar lagi hoti he
 The larger the cover message will be relative to the hidden message, the easier it will be to hide the latter
 is vajah se, internet or anya sanchaar media main sandesh chupaane ke liye digital tasveeron kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is unclear how much it is actually used in general
 udhaaharan ke liye: ek 24 bit ke bitmap main prayek pixel main teen rangon ke maan har ek kaa pratinidhtv karte 8 bit honge
 If we consider only blue, then blue will have 2 8 different values
 nile rang kii tivrata ke liye xxrep 8 1 or xxrep 7 1 0 ke bich maan main antar ko maanviya drushti se pahchaan naa paane kii sambhaavna he
 Therefore, the minimum significant bit can be used for something other than color information
 agar ham yah hare or laal rang ke saath kar saken to prayek teen pixel ke liye ham ASCII kaa ek akshar paa sakate hai
 To be more formally stated, steganographic encoding is designed to be more difficult to detect, to ensure that carriers are visually negligible due to the interpolation of the payload; That is, it is difficult to identify the change from the noisy floor of the carrier
 koi bhi madhyam vaahak ho saktaa he, lekin badi maatra main nirarthak yaa sampidya soochna ke saath media adhik upyukt hai
 From a theoretical point of view, this means that the channel must have more capacity than the 'surface' required by the signal, that is, it must be redundant
 ek digital image ke liye, yah imaging tatv se shor ho saktaa he; digital audio ke liye yah recording takneekon yaa pravardhan upkaran se shor ho saktaa he
 In general, electronics that digitize a synchronous signal suffer from multiple noise sources such as thermal noise, flutter noise, and shot noise
 yah shor, grahan kii gai digital soochna main paryaapt bhinnata uplabdh karaata he, jiskaa laabh, chupe data ko shor se dhakne ke liye uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, lossy compression schemes always introduce an error in the compressed data; It can also be taken advantage of for steganographic use
 stegnographi kaa upyog digital jal-chihn ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan sandesh ek image main chipa rahata he, taaki uske strot kaa pataa lagayaa ja sake yaa satyapit kiya ja sake
 When considering the case that messages in e-mail messages can be stenographically encrypted, especially e-mail spam, a completely new approach to the notion of junk e-mail emerges
 "chhaantnaa or chunanaa" takanic ke saath, preshak sandesh baahar nikaal sakate hai or tatkaal apni nishaniyon ko mitaa sakate hai
 Rumors about the use of steganography by terrorists began for the first time on 5 February 2001 in two articles in the daily newspaper USA Today, titled "terrorist Instructions Hidden On-line" and "terror Groups Hyde Behind Web Encryption"
 In July of the same year, the information looked even more clear: "militants wire web with links to jihad"
 a quote from a USA Today article: "recently, al Qaeda militants have been sending hundreds of encrypted messages hidden in digital photography files on auction site ebay

 " duniya bhar main media dwaara, visheshkar 9 / 11 aatankwaadi hamale ke baad- bina kisi vaastavik pramaan ke-ye afvaahen kai baar uddhrut kii gayi
 The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that the computers of an Al Qaeda cell seized at the Via Quaranta mosque in Milan contained pornographic images and used these images to hide secret messages

 In October 2001, the New York Times published an article claiming that al-qaeda had used steganographic techniques to codify messages to prepare and carry out the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, and then sent them via e-mail Via and possibly via USENET

 According to Jain texts, Arhat Dev has described the world as eternal by the expectation of a material new world
 jagat kaa na to koi karta he or na jeevon ko koi sukh dukh denevaala he
 According to their own actions, living beings get happiness and sorrow
 jeev yaa aatma kaa mul swabhaan shuddh, buddha, sachchidanandmay he, keval pudgal yaa karm ke aavaran se uskaa mul swarup aachhadit ho jaataa he
 At the time when this plant load is removed, the soul attains the higher state of God
 jain mat 'syadwad' ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 Syadvad means polytheism, that is, relative acceptance of different religions, such as continualism and impermanence, resemblance and disharmony, sattva and asattva, eligibility and indescribability in the same substance
 is mat ke anusaar akaash se lekar deepak paryant samast padaarth nityatv or anityatv aadi ubhay dharm yukt he
 There are 24 Tirthankaras considered in Jainism
 tirthankar dharm tirth kaa pravartan karte he
 There are 24 Tirthankaras of this period - rishabhdev, arishtanemi aadi tirthankarasn kaa ullekh rigvedadi main bahulata se miltaa he, jisase yah swatah siddh hota he ki vedon kii rachana ke pehle jain-dharm kaa astitv bharat main tha
 Vishnu Purana mentions Sri Rishabhdev, Manusmriti's first Jin Skandpuran, Lingapuran, etc
, the twenty-second Tirthankara Arishtanemi
 diksha murti-sahasranam, vaishampayan sahasranam mahimna stotra main bhagwaan jineshwar va arhant kah ke stuti kii gai he
 In Yoga Vashishta, Shriram wishes for peace like the 'jin' God
 isi tarah rudrayamalatantr main bhavani ko jineshvari, jinamata, jinendra kahkar sambodhan kiya he
 In Nagar Purana, the fruit of giving food to a Jain sage in Kali-yuga is said to be equivalent to feeding ten Brahmins in Kritayuga

 shesh ke vishay main anek prakaar kii aloqik or prakrutiviruddh kathaayen hai

 and they are counted in 24 incarnations of Hindus
 mahabharat anushaasan parv, mahabharat shantiparv, skandh puraana, prabhas puraana, lankavatar aadi anek grantho main arishtanemi kaa ullekh he
 In Jainism, non-violence is considered to be the ultimate religion
 sab jeev jeena chaahate hai, maranaa koi nahin chahta, atev is dharm main pranivadh ke tyaag kaa sarvapratham upadesh he
 It is not only the killing of the souls, but also the untruthful speech which hurts others, is also described as a part of violence
 mahavir ne apane bhikshuon ko upadesh dete hue kaha he ki unhen bolte-chaalate, uthte-baithte, sote or khate-pite sadaa ytnsheel rahanaa chahie
 Attachment is a violence in the works of rituals, so conquering the disorders, suppressing the senses and narrowing all your instincts is called true non-violence in Jainism
 prithvi, jal, agni, vaayu or vanaspati main bhi jivan he, atev prithvi aadi akendriya jeevon kii hinsa kaa bhi is dharm main nishedh he
 The second important principle of Jainism is karma
 mahavir ne baar baar kaha he ki jo jaisaa acha, bura karm karata he uskaa fal avashya hi bhogana padataa he tathaa manushya chaahe jo praapt kar saktaa he, chaahe jo ban saktaa he, isaliye apane bhagya kaa vidhaataa vah swayan he
 In Jainism, God is not considered to be the doer of the world, through austerities etc
, the Supreme state of self-development has been described as God
 yahan nity, ek athwa mukt ishwar ko athwa avatharavaad ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 With the destruction of these eight deeds of knowledge, sight-seeing, altariness, infatuation, age, name and gotra, when the creature is freed from the bondage of karma, then he becomes God and due to being freed from raga-malice, that creation Does not fall into the greatness of jaindharm main jeev, pudgal, dharm, adharm, akaash or kaal naam ke chha: dravya maane gaye hai
 These matter are found in Lokakash, there is only sky in Alokakash
 jeev, ajeev, asrav, bandha sanvar, nirjara or moksh ye saat tatv he
 Adoration of these elements leads to attunement
 samyagdarshan ke baad samyaggyaan or phir vrath, tap, sanyam aadi ke paalan karne se samyakcharitra utpann hota he
 These three gems have been described as the path of salvation
 ratnatray kii purnataa praapt kar lene par moksh kii prapti hoti he
 On salvation, the organism is freed from the bondage of all actions, and due to the upward movement, it is situated on the siddhashila in the front of the world
 use anant darshan, anant gyaan, anant sukh or anant veery kii prapti hoti he or vah antkaal tak vahaan nivas karata he, vahaan se lautakar nahin aata

 ise ahimsa kaa hi vyapak rup samajhnaa chahie
 The subject of misunderstanding of the rage, of the rites, to understand the vision of another properly, is the name of pluralism
 isse manushya satya ke nikat pahunch saktaa he
 According to this theory, no belief or principle can be said to be completely true
 prayek mat apni apni paristhitayon or samasyaon ko lekar udbhoot hua he, atev prayek mat main apni apni visheshtaayen hai
 The polytheist proceeds by coordinating them all
 aage chalakar jab is siddhant ko taarkik rup diya gaya to yah syadwad naam se kaha jane laga tathaa, syat asti', 'syat naasti', syat asti naasti', 'syat avaktavy,' 'syat asti avaktavy', 'syat naasti avaktavy' or 'syat asti naasti avaktavy', in saat bhaagon ke kaaran saptabhangi naam se prasiddh hua
 Jainism emphasizes self-purification
 aatmshuddhi praapt karne ke liye jain dharm main deh-daman or kshtshishnutaa ko mukhya mana gaya he
 The ascetic Mahavir used to roam in a naked state due to being silent and impassive
 yah bahya tap bhi antarang shuddhi ke liye hi kiya jaataa tha
 It is said in ancient Jain sources that even if someone remains in a naked state or fasts for a month, but if he has maya in his mind, he is not going to get perfection
 jain aachaar-vichaar ke paalan karne ko 'shuron kaa maarg' kaha gaya he
 Just as chewing iron gram, eating sand of grass, crossing the sea with arms and walking on the edge of a sword is difficult, the conduct of the discourse is also said to be incurable
 buddha dharm kii bhanti jain dharm main bhi jatibhed ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 The ancient Jain texts state that the true Brahmin is the one who has conquered raga, malice and fear and who has control over his senses
 jain dharm main apane apane karmon ke anusaar hi brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra kii kalpana kii gai he, kisi jati vishesh main utpann hone se nahin
 Mahavira had initiated many mlechha, thieves, bandits, fishermen, prostitutes and Chandalputras into Jainism
 is prakaar ke anek kathanak jain granthon main paae jate hai
 All the Tirthankars of Jainism took place in the Kshatriya clan
 isse maaloom hota he ki purvakaal main jain dharm kshatriyon kaa dharm tha, lekin aajkal adhikansh vaisya log hi iske anuyaayi hai
 By the way, how many Jains do farming business in South India like Setwal etc
 panchamon main brahman, kshatriya or vaisya in teenon varnon ke dhandhe karanevaale log paae jate hai
 Except for the followers of the Jinsen Math, the followers of any monastery are not called ivs
 chaturth log saadharantaya kheti or jameendaari karte hai
 In Satara and Bijapur districts, many followers of Jainism practice julaha, chhupi, tailor, goldsmith and kasare etc
 jain granthon main saat tattvon kaa varnan miltaa hai
 These are jain dharm main shravak or muni donon ke liye paanch vrath bataae gaye he
 The great men who follow the Tirthankaras are called Mahavrata - muni in vraton kaa sookshm rup se paalan karte he, vahi shravak sthool rup se karte he
 According to Jain texts, Jiva and Ajiva are the two main substances
 asrav, bandh, sanvar, nirjara, moksh, punya, paap ajeev dravya ke bhed hai
 According to Jainism, folk is made up of 6 liquids
 yah 6 dravya shaashvat hai arthath inako banaaya yaa mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 This is Jiva, Pudgal, Dharma, Unrighteousness, Akash and Kaal
 yah ratnatray aatma ko chhodkar anya kisi dravya main nahin rahata
 There are eight parts of Samyaktva - Disarmament, Discontinuity, Nirvikikitsattva, Amodrishtitva, Upabhumna / Upaguhana, Situation, Influence, Vatsalya
 krodh, maan, maaya, lobh yah chaar kashay he jinke kaaran karmon kaa asrav hota he

 ahimsa or jeev dayaa par bahut jor diya jaataa he
 All Jains are vegetarian
 anekaantwaad kaa arth he- ek hi vastu main paraspar virdohi anek dharm yugalon kaa sweekaar
 Syadvad means the rendering of many religions that are objectified by different expectations
 jain dharm kaa param pavitra or anadi moolmantra he- That is to say hello to the Arihants, hello to the Siddhas, hello to the Acharyas, hello to the Upadhyas, hello to all the Sadhus
 ye panch parameshthi hai
 Just as Kaal is divided in Manvantar kalpa etc
 in Hindus, similarly Kaal in Jain is of two types - Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 avasarpini kaal main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan,aayu,bal ityadi ghatata he jabaki utsarpini main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan or aayu, bal ityadi badhata he in donon kaa kaalmaan das krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he arthath ek samaychakra bees krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he
 Each Tirthankara, 12 Chakravarti, 9 Baldev, 9 Narayana and 9 Pratinarayana are born in each Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 inhen tristh shlakapurush kaha jaataa he
 The 24 Tirthankaras counted above belong to the present Avasarpini
 prayek utsirpini yaa avasarpini main nae nae jeev tirthankar hua karte hai
 With the teachings of these Tirthankaras, Ganadhar people make twins
 ye hi dwadashang jain dharm ke mul granth maane jate he
 How ancient Jainism is, cannot be said exactly
 jain grantho ke anusaar jain dharm anadikaal se he
 Mahavir Swami or Vardhaman attained nirvana 527 years before Christ
 isi samay se peeche kuch log visheshkar european vidvan jain dharm kaa prachlit hona maanate hai
 The Jains have divided their texts into Agam, Purana etc
 pro jecobi aadi ke aadhunik anveshanon ke anusaar yah siddh kiya gaya he kii jain dharm buddha dharm se pehle kaa he
 The antiquity of Jainism is also found from the inscriptions of Udayagiri, Junagadh etc
 hindu granth, skanda puraana ke anusaar: "rishabhdev nabhiraj ke putr the, rishabh ke putr bharat the, or inke hi naam par is desh kaa naam "bharatvarsh" padaa"| In Indian astrology, the style of the Greeks propagated three hundred years behind the Vikram Samvat
 par jainon ke mul granth angon main yavan jyotish kaa kuch bhi abhas nahin he
 Just as the Ved Samhita of the Brahmins has a five-year age and constellations are counted from the Kritika, similarly the Jana texts are also in the scriptures
 isse unki pracheenta siddh hoti he
 After Lord Mahavira, there have been many sages and acharyas in this tradition, the main of which are- tirthankar mahavir ke samay tak avichhin rahi jain parampara isa kii teesri sadi main do bhaagon main vibhakt ho gayi : digambar or shwetambar
 Muni Pramanasagar ji has written in detail on this division of Jains in his work 'jainism and Philosophy' that Acharya Bhadrabahu knew on the strength of his knowledge that a severe famine of 12 years is going to happen in North India, so he gave all the sadhus Instructed that to avoid this terrible famine, one should travel to South India
 acharya bhadrabahu ke saath hajaaron jain muni dakshin kii ore vartmaan ke tamilnadu or karnataka kii ore prasthaan kar gaye or apni sadhana main lage rahe
 But some Jain monks stayed in North India itself
 akaal ke kaaran yahan ruke hue saadhuon kaa nirvaah aagmanuroop nahin ho paa rahaa tha isliye unhone apni kai kriyaayein shithil kar leen, jaise kati vastra dhaaran karnaa, 7 gharon se bhiksha grahan karnaa, 14 upkaran saath main rakhana aadi
 After 12 years, the sadhus who returned from the south saw all this and they explained to the sadhus residing here that you once again adopted the tradition of Tirthankara Mahavir, but the sadhus did not agree and then Digambara and Shvetambara became two sects in Jainism
 digambar sadhu vastra nahin pahante he, nagn rahete hai or sadhviyaan shwet vastra dhaaran karti hai
 In Digambar Matha, the idols of the Tirthakaras are made completely naked and they are not adorned
 digambar samudaay teen bhaagon vibhakt hai
 Shwetambars and Sadhvis and Saints wear white robes, idols of Tirthakaras are made and decorated with metal eyes, coils on the idol
 shwetambar bhi do bhaag me vibhakt he: Sthanavasi also has two parts: - digambar aacharyon dwaara samast jain aagam grantho ko chaar bhaago main baanta gaya he - Elementary Sutra - Granth accepted by all Jains pramukh jain granth hai :- Kalpasutra jain dharm ke pramukh tyohaar is prakaar hai
 Hindu or Sanatan · Buddhist · Sikh · Jain · Islam · Other prajnan kii vah kriya jisamen do yugmakon ke milane se bani rachana yugmaj dwaara naye jeev kii utpatti hoti he, langik janan kehalaati he
 If the gametes are of the same shape, then it is called as homozygous
 samayugmakon ke sanyog ko sanyugman kehete hai
 The zygote either gives birth directly to the plant or becomes intermittent zygote called zygospore
 is prakaar ke langik janan ko 'samayugmi' kehete hai
 The process of sexual reproduction has two main stages - meiosis and fertilization
