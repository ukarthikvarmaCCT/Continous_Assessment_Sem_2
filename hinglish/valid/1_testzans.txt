 For example, the ears do the work of hearing and the eyes do the work of seeing, but in relation to hearing and seeing physiology it provides knowledge about how the sound reaches the ear screen and the rays of light fall on the lens of the eye
 How the image of the object reaches the brain
 isi prakaar, manushya jo bhojan karata he, uskaa pachan kis prakaar hota he, pachan ke ant main uskaa aanton kii bhittiyon se avasorana kis prakaar hota he, aadi
 The basic natural events of life of all living organisms are the same
 atyant asmaan jeevon main kriyavigyaan apni samasyaayen atyant spasht rup main upasthit karata he
 In high-level beings, the actions of the major organs of the body are very specific, which makes it possible to understand them by paying attention to the subtle details of the actions
 )nimnlikhit mul prakritik ghatnaayen hai, jinase jeev pahachaane jate hai: Organization - This is more evident in higher level beings
 sanrachana or kriya ke vikaas main samantarata hoti he, jisase sharirkriyavidon kaa yah kathan siddh hota he ki sanrachana hi kriya kaa nirdharak upadan he
 There is subtle cooperation in different parts of the person, which increases the power of the creature to adapt to the surrounding environment
 urja kii khapat - jeev urja ko visarjeet karte hai
 Man's life is created by the physical activities that relate him to the environment
 in shaareerik kriyakalapon ke liye urja kaa satat vyay aavashyak he
 In the absence of food or oxygen, the activities of the body come to an end
 sharir main adhik urja kii aavashyaktaa hone par uski purti bhojan evam oxigen kii adhik maatra se hoti he
 Thus respiration and disorganization activities are necessary for life
 jin vastuon se hamaare khaadya padaarth banate hai, ve oxikaran main sakasham hoti hai
 This oxidation action produces heat
 sharir main honevaali oxikaran kii kriya se urja utpann hoti he, jo jivit praani kii kriyasheeltaa ke liye uplabdh rahati he
 Growth and reproduction - If the metabolic process is predominant, then growth occurs, with which the power of compensation is associated
 vruddhi kaa prakram ek nishchit samay tak chalata he, jiske baad prayek jeev vibhakt hota he or uskaa ek ansh alag hokar ek yaa anek nae vyaktiyon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Each of them has all the properties that the native organism has
 sabhi ucch koti ke jeevon main mul jeev kshayshil hone lagata he or antat: mrityu ko praapt hota he
 Adaptation - There is a common feature in all living organisms, that is the power of adaptation
 aantar sambandh tathaa bahya sambandhon ke satat samanvay kaa naam anukulan he
 The actual environment of living cells is the tissue fluid in which they reside
 yah aantar vaataavaran, praani ke saamaanya vaataavaran main honevaale parivartanon se prabhavit hota he
 For the survival of the organism it is necessary to neutralize the changes in the environment, so that the internal environment, as it may be, remains within the living limits
 yahi anukulan he
 Most of the knowledge of physiology has been available from daily life and study of patients, but some knowledge has also been available from experiments conducted on animals
 rasayan, bhautikee, sharirarachana vigyaan or oothkavigyaan se iskaa atyant nikat kaa sambandh he
 Analytical physiology is thus built on the knowledge gained from experiments conducted on living beings, or on isolated parts, which survive for some time in a favorable state
 prayogon se vibhinn sanrachanaatmak bhaagon ke gun or kriyaayein gyaat hoti hai
 In synthetic physiology we try to find out how the processes of the body are synthesized by the mobilizing processes, forming the cooperative processes of different parts and how the organisms, by harmonizing their different organs in the macro form, Reacts to change in external condition
 pratimaan - sanrachana or sharirkriyaatmak gunon main ek hi jati ke praani aapas main bahut milte julate hai or jaev lakshanon ke maanak praroop kii ore unmukh yah pravriti jeev or uske vatavaran ke bich sannikat saamanjasy kii abhivyakti he
 This similarity is highest among beings born from the same parent, at the same time
 jyon jyon ham anya jatiyon ke praaniyon kii samaantaaon ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai, unamem bhed badhata jaataa he or praaniyon ke vargeekaran main jantujgat ke chhoron par sthit praaniyon kaa antar itnaa adhik hota he ki unki tulana aspasht hoti he
 Nevertheless, where there is a very close relationship between individual beings, as in human race, the difference between them is also evident
 saamaanya maanav vyashti kaa adhyayan karnaa, maanav fiziology kaa kartavya he, kyonki isse rog ke adhyayan kii mahatvapurn aadharbhumi taiyaar hoti he, parantu yah kahana ki kisi prastut lakshan kaa prakritik swaroop kya he, kathin he
 In addition, the results of all physiologic experiments show substantial differences, depending on the individual nature of the disposable animals
 isiilie mahatvapurn samuchit niyantranon kaa or mahatvapurn parinaam kaa adhimulyan nahin hona chahie
 Ideal results are often considered to determine the outcome
 prayogon kii punraritiyaan aavashyak hai
 The error of observation, which is often small in real sciences, is very high in biology, because of variable variability in observation due to variable individuality
 jis prakaar anya vigyaanon main parinaamon ko sankhyikee dwaara vivechit kiya jaataa he, vaise hi fiziology ko parinaamon kii sambhavita ke niyam kii prayukti se vivechit kiya jaataa he
 Very careful decision making is required from a limited number of experiments in terms of whether the results obtained are different from the controlled ranges
 kathinaaiyon ko dur karne kii ek vidhi ke rup main ausaton, arthath samaantar madhya, kaa aashray liya jaataa he, jaise ham kehete hai, maanav ke kisi samudaay vishesh main prati ghan millimetre rakt main laal selon kii ausat sankhya 5 karod 20 lakh he
 Although this method is the most fluid and highly behaved, it is unsatisfactory because it does not determine in what magnitude the deviation from the mean and how often is relative
 hamaare paas yah gyaat karne kaa koi saadhan nahin rah jaataa ki uparyukt udhaaharan main 4 karod 50 lakh saamaanya paraas ke andar he yaa nahin
 As a result, the practice of using more realistic means to express the results of statistics is increasing
 chunki kisi vigyaan kii vartmaan avasthaa ko samajhane ke liye uske vikaas kaa itihaas gyaat hona aavashyak he, isliye phiziology se ruchi rakhanevaale vyakti ke liye uske itihaas kii ruparekha se parichit hona aavashyak he
 As far as the development of the overall subject is concerned, it is a matter of keeping in mind that no part of science can develop separately, all parts depend on each other
 udaahranarth, ek nishchit seemaa tak sharir ke gyaan ke bina fiziology kii kalpana asambhav thi or isi prakaar bhautikee or rasayan kii ek seemaa tak viksit avasthaa ke bina bhi isaki pragati asambhav thi
 Below is a list of important names that have given the subject an epoch-making twist from time to time, considering the publication of 'fabrica humanis corporis' in 1543 AD by AndrÃ© Vicelius
 1795 i

 The English Journal of Physiology was published in 1878 AD and the American Journal of Physiology in 1898 AD
 1874 i
 main landan main university kaleje or america ke harvard main 1876 i
 main fiziolosi ke english chair kii sthapana hui
 Thus we see that Physiology is a new subject, which began barely a century ago

 rikt pariklpana ek aisi avadharana he jise awalokit data ke pareekshan kaa upyog kar galat sabit kiya ja saktaa he
 Such a test works by methodically constructing a null hypothesis, collecting data, and calculating how probable the data is, and to test whether the null hypothesis is true
 yadi data bahut asambhavy prathit hota he, to prayogkarta yah nishkarsh nikaalata he ki rikt pariklpana galat he
 If the data appears to be reasonable under the null hypothesis then no conclusions are drawn
 is maamle main, rikt pariklpana sach bhi ho sakati he, yaa yah abhi bhi galat ho sakati he; aisa data kisi bhi nishkarsh par pahunchne ke liye aparyaapt sakshya detaa hai
 The null hypothesis usually presents a normal or default state, as if there is no relationship between the two parameters, or no difference between treatment and control
 yah shabd mul rup se angreji anuvaanshiki vigyaani tathaa sankhyikeevid ronaald fishradwara rachit he
 In some versions of statistical hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is tested for an alternative concept
 yah vikalp rikt pariklpana kaa taarkik nishedh ho saktaa he or nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 The use of the alternative hypothesis was not part of Ronald Fisher's statistical hypothesis testing, although the alternative concept is used today as the standard
 udhaaharan ke liye, ho saktaa he ki koi is daawey kaa pareekshan karnaa chaahe ki ek nishchit dawa dil kaa daura hone ke avasaron ko kam kar sakati he
 One may select the null hypothesis "this drug does not reduce the chances of having a heart attack"
 phir vyakti ko aise logon kaa avlokan karke data sangrahit karnaa chahie jo kisi niyantrit prayog ke tahat dawa le rahe hai athwa nahin le rahe hai
 If the data under the null hypothesis is very unlikely, then you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that its negation is true
 arthath, aap yah nishkarsh nikaal sakate he ki dawa dil kaa daura hone kii sambhaavna ko kam karti he
 "impossible data" here refers to the data where the percentage of people who are taking medication after a heart attack is much lower than the percentage of people who are not taking medication even after a heart attack
 Huh
 rikt pariklpana kaa chayan karte samay aapako khyaal rakhana chahie kyunki vibhinn vikalpon kaa uttar alag-alag ho saktaa hai
 This fact is demonstrated in the following: Example: You are asked to decide if the coin is correct
 aap ise 5 baar uchhaalate he or har baar head aata hai
 Do you conclude that this is not a fair coin? An alternative hypothesis is that "this coin is biased towards the head"
 The null hypothesis would be "this coin is not biased towards the head", which means that at least the number of times the head comes
 Under this null hypothesis, the data is indeed implausible
 aap rikt pariklpana ko asweekaar kar sakate he or yah nishkarsh nikaal sakate he ki sikaa pakshpaati tha
 However, you can also select the alternative hypothesis "coin is biased", and the blank concept, "this coin is fair" instead
 tab data itnaa asambhavy nahin hota he; samaan data kam se kam 6% baar ghatit hona chahie, jahaan 3% samay aapako har baar head milanaa chahie tathaa 3% samay aapako tail milanaa chahie
 So no one will reject the null hypothesis, hence no conclusion will be drawn
 In this case, the second null hypothesis would prove to be correct: you were actually asked to decide whether the coin is fair or not, that the coin is biased towards the head
 aapako aise nishkarsh tak pahunchne ke liye or adhik data kii aavashyaktaa hogi 
 This second example illustrates a danger of hypothesis testing: if one tests a set of data with a large number of blank hypotheses that are all correct, it can still reject some of them , Which leads to incorrect conclusions
 haalanki, agar koi vaigyanik vidhi kaa anusaran karata he or data ekatrit karne se pehle rikt pariklpana kaa nirmaan kar letaa he, to vah kam sankhya me keval pehle prakaar kii galtiyaa karata he 
 Of course, even when used carefully and correctly, statistical testing gives some incorrect conclusions
 vaigyanik or chikitsa anuprayogon main, rikt pariklpana upachaar or niyantran samoohon main matbhed ke mahatv kaa pareekshan karne main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaati he
 Despite being ubiquitous, this usage is criticized on many grounds
 prayog kii shuruyaat main dharna yah hoti he ki do samoohon ke madhya koi antar nahin hai: yah is udhaaharan main rikt pariklpana he anya prakaar kii rikt pariklpana ke udhaaharan hai: For example, you can compare the test scores of two random samples between women and men, and ask whether the average score of one population-group is different from the other groups
 ek rikt pariklpana yah hogi ki purush jansankhya kaa ausat score mahila jansankhya ke ausat score ke samaan hai: Where: vaikalpik rup se, rikt pariklpana yah suzav pradaan kar sakati he ki donon namoonay samaan jansankhya se taiyaar hue hai, is prakaar vicharan or vitaran kaa aakaar baraabar hoga, isi prakaar ausat maan bhi samaan hoga
 Representation of the null hypothesis is an important step in testing statistical significance
 agar rikt pariklpana sahi he to aap praapt data ke avlokan kii sambhaavna sthapit kar sakate hai 
 Probability is usually called the "significance level" of the result
 arthath, vaigyanik prayogtmak dizin main, aap yah pariklpana kar sakate he ki ek vishesh kaarak hamaare nirbhar char par ek prabhaav utpann karegaa- yah vaikalpik pariklpana he
 We will then consider how often we expect to see our experimental results, or the results may be even more extreme if we have to take too many samples from a population that has no effect
 yadi ham yah pate hai ki aisa shaayad hi hota he, to ham yah nishkarsh nikaal sakate he ki hamaare parinaam hamaari prayogtmak bhavishyavaanee kaa samarthan karte hai- ham apni rikt pariklpana ko asweekaar karte hai
 Most statements in the null hypothesis are displayed as if they do not contain "directionality", meaning that the values are the same
 haalanki, rikt pariklpana ke paas "disha" ho sakati he tathaa hoti bhi he- in udaahranon main bahut se udhaaharan aise he jinamein sankhyikeey siddhant pareekshan prakriya ke nirmaan ke saral hone kii anumati detaa he, is prakaar kaa pareekshan ek sateek pahchaan ke liye pareekshan karne ke baraabar he
 For example, when formulating a one-sided alternative hypothesis, the use of drug a can increase in patients, then the true null hypothesis is contrary to the alternative concept i
e
 use of drug a will not increase in patients
 prabhavi rikt pariklpana aushadhi a kaa prayog hogi jiskaa rogiyon main vruddhi hetu koi prabhaav nahin hoga
 In order to understand why the effective null hypothesis is valid, it is instructive to consider the nature of the above mentioned concept
 aisi kalpana kii jaati he ki aushadhi a kaa prayog karne vaale rogi ek aise niyantran samooh kii tulana main zyada vruddhi karenge jo aushadhi kaa prayog nahin kar rahe hai
 meaning, jahaan: Effective null hypothesis h 0: Î¼ drug = Î¼ control { \ displaystyle H_ {0}: \ mu _ {drug} = \ mu _ {control}}
 satya rikt pariklpana h t : Î¼ d r u g â‰¤ Î¼ c o n t r o l { \ displaystyle H_{T}: \ mu _{drug} \ leq \ mu _{control}} 
 The reason for the minimization is that in order to estimate support for the alternative hypothesis, classical hypothesis testing forces us to calculate how often we have received extreme results compared to our experimental observations
 yah karne ke liye, sabase pehle hamen rikt pariklpana main sammilit prayek sambhaavna ke asweekaar hone kii sambhaavna paribhaashit karne kii jarurat hai tathaa doosraa yah sunishchit karne kii aavashyaktaa he ki ye sambhaavnaaen pareekshan ke mahattavapurn str kii tulana main kam yaa baraabar hai
 The largest of these probabilities for any proper test procedure, especially for cases covered only in h 0 { \ displaystyle H_ {0}}, will occur at the region limit HT { \ displaystyle H_ {T}}
 is prakaar pareekshan prakriya ko rikt pariklpana h t { \ displaystyle H_{T}} ke pareekshan hetu bilkul usee rup main paribhaashit kar sakate he jaise byaaj kii rikt pariklpana nunatam sanskaran h 0 { \ displaystyle H_{0}} thi
 Note that there are also some people who argue that the null hypothesis is not as general as mentioned above: as Fisher, who first coined the term "null hypothesis", has said, "the null hypothesis must be very accurate
" It means that it should be free from ambiguity and ambiguity because it should provide the basis for the 'distribution problem', the test of significance which is the solution
 " is drushtikon ke anusaar, rikt pariklpana sankhyanusaar sateek honi chahie- aisa nirdhaarit hona chahie ki ek vishesh maatra yaa antar ek vishesh sankhya ke baraabar honi chahie
 In classical science, it is generally well known that the statement that a particular treatment has no effect, in observation, usually means that there is no difference between the value and the prediction of a particular rated variable
 is drushtikon kii upyogita ke bare main poochtacha honi chahie- koi bhi yah note kar saktaa he ki abhyaas main bahut se rikt pariklpana pareekshan "sateek" hone kii is kasuti ko puraa nahin karte
 udhaaharan ke liye, saamaanya pareekshan par vichaar karen ki do maan samaan hai jahaan variances ke sachche maano kaa pataa nahin hai - variances ke sateek maano kaa koi ullekh nahin hai
 Most statisticians believe that it is valid to determine the direction as part of the null hypothesis or as a part of the null hypothesis / alternative concept pair
 tark kaaphi saral he: agar disha ko chhod diya jaataa he, to agar rikt pariklpana ko asweekaar kar diya he to nishkarsh kii vyakhya puri tarah bhraamak he
 Suppose, blank means population average = 10 and one-tailed alternative: mean> 10
 If the sample avidity obtained through x-bar is -200 and the corresponding t-test statistic is equal to -50
 , So what will be the conclusion? Is there not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis? Definitely not! But we cannot accept a unilateral option in this matter
 Therefore, to overcome this ambiguity, it is better to include the direction of the effect if the test is one-sided
 sankhyikeey siddhant jo yahaan samajhaae gaye saral maamalon or adhik jatil maamalon ke saath sanchaalan hetu aavashyak he vah nishpaksh pareekshan pariklpana kaa upyog karata he
 When hypothesis testing is done a lot of units are used
 yah prakriya adhyayan main shaamil ikaayiyon kii sankhya par nirbhar karti he
 Even though a null hypothesis does not matter in the population, it cannot be ruled out because the sample size is too small
 vishesh prayog athwa surveykshan ke liye namoona aakaar pareekshan kii sankhyikeey kshamta, prabhaav aakaar jo pataa lagane ke liye aavashyak he or mahatv ke vaanchit str par nirbhar karata he sankhyikeey pareekshan main sarthakata str rikt pariklpana ke asweekaar hone kii sambhaavna he jab rikt pariklpana ko jansankhya main dhaaran kiya gaya ho
 This ability is likely to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is not held in the population
 namoonay kaa aakaar jo pariklpana pareekshan prakriya main istemaal kiya jaayegaa, se sambandhit nirnay in teenon upayon par nirbhar karata he
 Issues related to sample size should be referred to the planning phase of the study

 He made extraordinary progress in sending wireless signals and first started using semiconductors to capture radio messages
 lekin apni khojon se vyavsaayik laabh uthaane kii jagah inhone inhen saarvajanik rup se prakashit kar diya taaki anya shodhakartta inpar aage kaam kar saken
 After this, he made many discoveries in botany
 inhone ek yantra crescograph kaa avishkaar kiya or isse vibhinn uttejkon ke prati paudhon kii pratikriya kaa adhyayan kiya
 In this way, they proved that there is a lot of similarity between flora and animal tissues
 ye patent prakriya ke bahut viruddh the or mitron ke kehane par hi inhone ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 In recent years, their contributions to modern science are again being recognized
 basu kaa janm 30 navambar 1858 ko bengal main dhaka jile ke faridpur ke memansingh main hua tha
 His father Lord Chandra Basu was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj and was a sub-magistrate or Assistant Commissioner in Faridpur, Bardhaman and elsewhere
 inkaa parivaar raarikhal gaanv, bikrampur se aayaa tha, jo aajkal bangladesh ke munshiganj jile main he
 By the age of eleven, he was educated in a school in the village
 basu kii shiksha ek bangla vidhyalay main prarambh hui
 His father believed that his mother tongue should be well versed before learning English
 vikrampur main 1915 main ek sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue basu ne kaha- "us samay par bacchon ko angreji vidyalayon main bhejnaa haisiyat kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 In the Bengali school i was sent to, i used to sit on my right side, the son of my father's Muslim attendant and on my left the son of a fisherman

 Xavier's School
 jagadish chandra bose kii jeev vigyaan main bahut ruchi thi or 22 varsh kii aayu main chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai karne ke liye landan chale gaye
 But due to poor health, he gave up the idea of becoming a doctor and went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and there, a famous professor of physics, Father Lafont, inspired Bose to study physics
 varsh 1885 main ye swadesh laute tathaa bhautikee ke sahaayak praadhyaapak ke rup main presidency college main padhaane lage
 Here he stayed until 1915
 us samay bhartiya shikshakon ko angrej shikshakon kii tulana main ek tihaai vetan diya jaataa tha
 This was opposed by Jagdish Chandra Bose and continued to work for three years without pay, due to which his condition deteriorated and he was severely indebted
 is karj ko chukaane ke liye unhen apni pushtaini jameen bhi bechni padi
 Jagdish Chandra Bose won the fourth year and was given full salary
 bose ek achche shikshak bhi the, jo kaksha main padhaane ke liye bade paimaane par vaigyanik pradarshnon kaa upyog karte the
 Some students of Bose like Satendra Nath Bose later became famous physicists
 british saidhantik bhautik vigyaani james clerk maxwell ne ganitiya rup se vividh tarang dairdhya kii vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, par unki bhavishyavaanee ke satyaapan se pehle 1879 main nidhan unka ho gaya
 British physicist Oliver Lodge demonstrated the existence of Maxwell waves by transmitting them with stars in 1887â€“88
 german bhautikashastri henrik hertz ne 1888 main mukt antariksh main vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv ko prayog karke dikhaaya
 Subsequently, Lodge continued Hertz's work and gave a memorable lecture in June 1894 and published it in book form
 loj ke kaam ne bharat ke bose sahit vibhinn deshon ke vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 The first notable aspect of Bose's microwave research was that he brought the wavelength to the millimeter level
 ve prakaash ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye lambii tarang dairdhya kii prakaash tarangon ke nuksaan ko samaj gaye
 In 1893, Nikola Tesla performed the first public radio communications

 His second article was sent to Lord Royal in London in October 1895 by Lord Rayleigh
 disambar 1895 main, landan patrika electrician ne bose kaa lekh "ek nae electro-polariscope par" prakashit kiya
 At that time the term 'coherer' coined by Lodge in the English-speaking world was used for Hertz's wave receiver or detector
 electrician ne tatkaal bose ke 'kohirar' par tippanee kii
 
 The commentary quoted from the English magazine Electrician is: bose "apane kohirar" ko behtar karne kii yojana banaai lekin yah patent ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 Bose conducted his experiments at a time when radio was developing as a contact medium
 radio microwave optics par bose ne jo kaam kiya tha wo radio communication se judaa hua nahin tha, lekin unke dwaara kiye hue sudhaar evam unke dwaara is vishay main likhe hue tathyon ne duusare radio avishkaarakon ko zarur prabhavit kiya tha
 In the late 1894 era, Guglielmo Marconi was working on a radio system that was being designed specifically for wireless telegraphy
 1896 ke aarambh tak yah pranali physics dwaara bataaye gaye range se zyaada duri main radio signlles transmit kar rahi thi
 Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first scientist to find out what the semiconductor junction was used to detect radio waves and discovered many microwave components in this method
 iske baad agle 50 saal tak millimetre lambaai kii electromagnetic tarango par koi shodh kaary nahin hua tha
 In 1897, Bose described his research on millimeter waves at the Royal Institution in London
 unhone apane shodh main vevagids, horn antena, daai -electric lens ,alag alag posraiser or semiconductor jinaki frequency 60 ghz tak thi -- unka istemaal kiya tha
 All these devices are still present at Bose Institute, Kolkata

 Sir Neville Mott received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his research work in Solid State Electronics
 unhone yah kaha tha kii acharya jagadish chandra bose apane samay se 60 saal aage the
 In fact, it was Bose who predicted the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors
 biophysics ke kshetra main unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha kii unhone apan dikhaaya kii paudho main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar vaidyuthik madhyam se hota hai naa kii chemical madhyam se
 These claims were later proven to be true through scientific proyogo
 acharya bose ne sabase pehle microwave ke vanaspati ke tishyu par hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But the zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid
 1917 main jagadish chandra bose ko "nite" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gai tathaa sheeghra hi bhautik tathaa jeev vigyaan ke liye royal sosayadi landan ke faillo chun liye gaye
 Bose had done all his research without any good equipment and laboratory, so Jagdish Chandra Bose was thinking of making a good laboratory

 yah kriya vah lamben samay se karti chali aa rahi thi
 By doing this, his house was full of all the money
 vah budhiya apane ghar ko shuddh karne ke liye, paddos main rahane vaali ek anya budhiya kii gaay kaa gobar laayaa karti thi
 The house from which she used to bring old cow dung, she started to think why it brings my cow dung
 isaliye vah apni gaay ko ghar ke bheetar baandhle lagi
 Due to non-receipt of old cow dung, she could not cleanse her house on Sunday and dipped it with cow dung
 iske kaaran na to usne bhojan hi banaaya or na hi bhoga hi lagaaya
 is prakaar uskaa us din niraahaar vrath ho gaya

 roj hi aisa karne se budhiya ko isaki khabar bhi naa lagi
 God saw that the clever neighbor was cheating the old lady, so he set a thunderstorm
 isse budhiya ne gaay ko ghar ke andar baandh liya
 In the morning, when he saw the cow dung of the cow, he was surprised
 ab vah gaay ko bheetar hi baandhne lagi
 On the other hand, the neighbor complained of jealousy to the king that the old lady has a cow worthy of kings, which gives gold
 raja ne yah sun apane duuton se gaay mangava lee

 unhone kalidas ke abhigyaan shaakuntalam kaa german bhashaa main anuwaad kiya
 Goethe had said about Abhigyan Shakuntalam- gete kaa 82 varsh lanbaa jeevankaal europea itihaas ke aise yug se sambandhit he jo badi badi krantiyon tathaa bhayankar uthal puthal kaa samay mana gaya he
 The beginning of his youth led to the rise of revolution in German literature, which resulted in a sharp opposition to old beliefs and literary principles and strongly supported the independence of the poet and artist and the revival of the old glory of national literature
 is â€˜tufaani yugâ€™ main kranti kii bhaavana ek prachand aandhi ke samaan prakat hui, jisane puraane vichaaron tathaa jarjar siddhanton ke khandhar dharashayi kar die
 After this, in the middle of his life, there was a storm of French political revolution which shook the walls of the old system and created a beautiful dream of golden age in the hearts of millions of people, although this dream proved to be just as momentary as that of Mrigamarika, because its womb This led to the emergence of Napoleon, whose fast-moving conquistadores established a kingdom of complete despair in place of hope in Europe
 Installed
 ant main apane jivan ke sandhyakaal main usne audyogic kranti ke vyapak parivartanon kaa purna anubhav kiya or us naveen aarthik vyavastha kaa udai bhi dekha jo samaaj ke puraane dhaanche ko tod phodkar dhire dhire spasht ho rahi thi
 The impression of all these experiences is evident in his works, as his sensitive heart was immediately affected by external conditions
 vah atyant bhaagyashaalee purush tha
 The shadow of lack never came in his life
 prakruti ne saundarya tathaa swasthya ke saath hi saath use bahumukhi pratibha kaa vardaan diya tha jisane use vibhinn kaaryakshetron main safal tathaa pratishthin banaaya
 He was not only a poet or artist, but also a successful scientist, seeker and philosopher
 uskaa adhikaar europe kii kai bhashaaon par tha; uski gyanpipasa aseem thi or bimer riyasat main usne apane jivan kaa bahumulya bhaag rajshasan tathaa rangamanch sanchaalan jaise uttardaayitvapurn kaamon main bitaayaa tha
 Keeping these things in mind, it will not be difficult to understand that he strengthened and enriched all parts of German literature and made such a deep and wide impact that after that hardly any eminent German poet or artist was left untouched by him
 uski sabal lekhnee ne geetkavy, mahakavy, upanyaas, naatak, tathaa aalochanatmak prabandhon kaa prachur maatra main srijan kiya or usne kisi bhi vishay ko sparsh karke apni shakti, naveenta tathaa moulikta se aprabhavit nahin choda
 His personal experiences have been incorporated into Goethe's various works and the element that binds them all in one sutra is his personality which continues to evolve over time
 isliye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki uski vibhinnkaaleen kritiyon main uskaa naitik, bauddhik tathaa aadhyatmik charit nihit he
 During the spring time of life, his feelings were intense and simple and he expressed in simple but vigorous language which seemed to be the natural outgrowth of the emotional heart
 parantu mastashk kii paripakvata ke saath hi saath bhav kii garima tathaa bhashaa kaa parishkar or chhandon kii jatilta uttarottar badhane lagi or ant main uske shabd bhaavon se bojhil ho gaye evam hriday ke bhav mastashk ke anushaasan se niyantrit hue
 This means that he made a successful attempt to co-ordinate the opposing tendencies of his personality and all his literature and philosophy preaches the sacred duty of coordination in this way
 usne is baat par vishesh jor diya ki manushya kii antarmukhi pravriti hanikaarak he or ise bahirmukhi bananaa atyaavashyak he jisase vyakti tathaa samaaj, aatma tathaa bahya prakruti main swasth saamanjasy ho sake
 This fact is found in all his works
 uske geetkavy vyaktigat prem se aarambh hote hai parantu kalantar main manushya tathaa prakruti kaa drudh sambandh unka mukhya vishay hota he-vah prakruti jo brahmamay he or jiske saath maanav kii aatma kaa atoot sambandh he kyonki sristi ke vividh praani ekta ke sutara main bandhe hai

 Two of Goethe's later novels, 'wilhelm Mistar' and its later version, pave the way for the development of style as well as the harmony of the individual and society, and in the last book, the author succeeded the industrial-era social system and the problems inherent in it
 And have done live analysis
 gete kii kritiyon main naatakon kaa vishesh sthaan he or unamem mukhya hai â€˜gotjâ€™, â€˜yagmaantâ€™, â€˜iffinjiniâ€™, â€˜taasoâ€™ or â€˜foustâ€™
 Suffice it to say here that 'foust' is the best symbol of Goethe's talent and an invaluable gem of world literature
 isaki rachana kaa itihaas â€˜geteâ€™ ke vikaas kaa itihaas he or naatak ke nayak kii jeevanakatha maanav aatma ke vikaas kii katha he
 'faust' is a pre-requisite character of medieval folklore, which Goethe has considered a symbol of humanity
 yah vyakti aarambh main varder ke hi samaan ahambhaav se aakraant he parantu dhire dhire uskaa man anya vyaktiyon tathaa bahya sansar kii ore aakrisht hota he
 The first phase is the love of an innocent girl whose end proves to be miserable, then her entry into society and after coming in contact with Helen, she reads the text of Karma's utility and finally in her development by owning a vast plot
 Closed ends his lifeline

 Goethe's sharp vision invented many elements that evolved over time to become conceivable

 The famous English poet Arnold called Goethe the 'physician of the Iron Age', but Goethe's ideas are still new and alive

 Just as the six juices of taste of tongue are famous, similarly the nine juices of taste of heart are famous
 jihva ke aswaad ko loukik anand kii koti main rakhaa gaya he kyonki uskaa sidhaa sambandh loukik vastuon se he
 The taste of the heart is considered to be in the category of supernatural bliss because its direct relation bhartiya kavyachaaryon ne rason kii sankhya praayah nau hi maani he kyonki unke mat se nau bhav hi aise hai jo manushya kii mul pravritiyon se ghanishthatya sambandhit hokar sthayitv kii puri kshamta rakhte hai or ve hi viksit hokar vastutah ras sangya kii prapti ke adhikari kahe ja sakate hai
 This recognition has also been controversial, but has accepted the nature of humor unquestioningly from all
 manovigyaan ke visheshgyon ne bhi haas ko mul pravriti ke rup main samuchit sthaan diya he or iske vishleshan main paryaapt manan chintan kiya he
 This contemplation has been given a more elaborate expression by Western poetry than Pravatya poetry, but still it cannot be said that they have studied this element in its entirety and or any such definition of the poetic expression of humor or Haas Has given which can accommodate all types of examples
 bhartiya aacharyon ne ek prakaar ke sutararup main hi iskaa prakhyapan kiya he kintu unki sankshipt uktiyon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi nishkarshon or tatwon kaa saraltapurvak antarbhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 Bharata Muni's Natyashastra for humor, says- bhavaprakash main likhaa he- The narrator's statement is- dasharupakkaar kii ukti he- This implies that Haas is a ritualistic gesture and a form of Chittavikas
 uskaa udrek vikrut aakaar, vikrut vesh, vikrut aachaar, vikrut abhidhaan, vikrut alankaar, vikrut arthvishesh, vikrut vaani, vikrut cheshtaa aadi dwaara hota he - in vikrutiyon se yukt hasyapatrata chaahe abhinayta kii ho, chaahe vaktaa kii ho, chaahe anya kisi kii ho
 Deformation means any imagery that is contrary to the expected or singular, some absurdity, which we may find loving, may not be traumatic
 in lakshanon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi lakshan samavisht ho jate hai, jahaan tak unka sambandh hasya vishyon se he
 When such a development develops, we get it in a free state, in a simplified form by Kavikaushal, or according to the terminology of Acharya Pt
 Ramachandra Shukla, it is called humorous
 haas ke bhav kaa udrek desh-kaal-paatr-saapeksh rahata he
 If there is an open body at home, the viewer will not laugh but if he reaches in the same way in the festival, then his behavior will arouse laughter because it is considered contrary or perverse than expected; His behavior will become Haas's mother
 yuva vyakti shringaar kare to fabane kii baat he kintu jarjar budde kaa shringaar haas kaa kaaran hoga; kursi se giranevaale pahalwaan par ham nishchit hi hansane lagenge parantu chat se giranevaale bachche par hamaari karunapurna sahanubhuti hi umadegi
 It has already been said that Haas is based on love and not malice, so if one is to sarcasm at the perversion of one's nature, tendency, temperament, ethics, etc
, it is not as sarcasm but as a proverb
 It will not have a feeling of burning or degrading at the bottom, but a feeling of pure purification
 sanshuddhi kii bhaavanavali yah priyokti bhi upadesh kii shabdaawalee main nahin kintu ranjanta kii shabdaawalee main hogi
 Distinctions of humor have also been considered by the Acharyas
 unhone hasya ke do bhed kiye hai
 One is Athastha and the second is Prastha
 hasyapatr kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he swat: us paatr kaa hansnaa or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansaana
 From the point of view of socials or gentle listeners, or theatrical performers, there is selfish humor without the laughter of others, they have excellent humor and poignant humor
 drushtikonon kaa yah antar samaj lene par in donon shabdon ke arthon kaa vichaar saraltapurvak samaapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Then, the Acharyas have made six distinctions of humor - Smit, Hissit, Visshah, Vashika, Vastha and Vashikaha; Those who do not have to be discriminated but will have to accept the distinction of Hasankriya
 sankshep main, aankhon kii muskaraahat smit he
 Seeing thirty-two sounds is beautiful, the sound that comes out is disturbed
 ang hill uthanaa avahasit he
 The stomach laughter is unheralded and the whirring whirring rib is laughable
 sahityadarpanakaar ne smit or hasith ko shreshthon ke yogya kaha he
 The depraved and the subjugated have been called worthy of the middle class people and the abducted and the oppressed are worthy of the lowly people
 rangamanch main darshakon ke liye bhi hansane kii ek maryaada honi chahie, us drushti se uttam, madhyam, adham kii yah baat bhale hi maan lee ja sakati he
 Otherwise, the laughable laughter will deprive the upper class of public health an important element only by understanding the object of inferiority
 dow ramkumar verma ne uttam, madhyam, adham ke prabhaav kii ishti se hasya ke teen bhed maane hai or inhen aatmasth, parastha se guneet karke hasan kriya ke baarah bhed likhe hai
 Smit, Hasit etc
 Hasanakriya Vriddhas can be said to have a sense of humor
 in anubhaavon kaa varnan maatr kar dena alag baat he or apni rachana dwaara saamaajikon main ye anubhav utpann kara dena alag baat he
 Comicer's successful creation is one that spontaneously produces the feel of humor
 videshi vidwaanon ke vichaar se hasya ke paanch pramukh bhed hai jinke naam hai - humar, vit, satair, irni or fars 
 Humer and Fars are related to the subject of humor, while Bit, Satire and Irony are related to the skill of utterance, in which the last two are not only gratifying but also satisfying
 parody bhi hasya kii ek vidha he jiskaa uktikaushal se sambandh he kintu jiskaa pradhan uddeshy he santushti
 Irony means mockery
 uphaas main, hamaare vichaar se, irni kaa bhi antarbhaav maan liya janaa chahie anyathaa vah hasya kii koti se baahar kii vastu ho jaaegi
 Wit or Vagvayadhyaya can be called a specific ornament
 bhartiya sahityapanditon ne jis prakaar shringaar ke saath nyaay kiya he uskaa dashamansh bhi hasya ke saath nahin kiya, yadhyapi bharat muni ne isaki utpatti shringaar se maani he arthath ise rati yaa priti kaa pariman mana he or ise shringaar ke baad hi navrason main mahatv kaa darja diya he
 It has a direct relationship with Anand and has its own specialness not only in terms of Ranjanata but also in terms of utility
 yah tan man ke tanaav dur karata he, swabhaav kii karkashta mitaatha he, aatmanirikshan or aatmaparishkar ke saath hi mithe dhang par samajasudhar kaa maarg prashast karata he, vyakti or samaaj kii thakaan dur kar unamem taazgi bharta hua janaswasthya or lokswasthya kaa upakaarak banataa he
 It is certain that the proportion of importance of this comic in Sanskrit literature and Hindi literature is lacking
 phir bhi aitihaasik simhavlokan se yah bhi spasht ho jaataa he ki sahitya main hasyaras kaa pravaah vaidic kaal se lekar aaj tak nirantar chalaa aa rahaa he, yadhyapi vartmaan kaal ke purv usein vividhta itani nahin jitani aaj dikhaai pad rahi he
 The diversity of the stream of humorous can be seen from the point of view of subject and euphemism
 vishay ko ham akruti, prakruti, paristhiti, vesh, vaani, vyavhaar or vastu main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 The absurdity of the figure is obesity, ugliness, clumsiness, mutilation, irresponsible, belly, hump, extreme blackness of women, etc
 inamen se anek vishyon par hasyaras kii rachanaayen ho chuki hai
 It is worth noting that the ridiculous subject of one time becomes the ridiculous subject of all times, it does not happen
 aaj angabhang, nirmutchta aadi hasya ke vishay nahin maane jate atev ab inpar rachanaayen karnaa hasya kii suruchi kaa parichaayak na mana jayega
 The absurdity of nature or temperament is foolishness, stupidity, hypocrisy, blush, bliss, indecent fashionedness, miserliness, pretentiousness, superfluousness, unauthorized egoism, etc
 akruti ke betukepan kii apeksha prakruti ke betukepan ko apana lakshya banaakar rachanaayen karnaa adhik prashast he
 The creators have done good satire on the practices of skirmish etc
, but many subjects have been left untouched in this direction
 paristhiti kaa betukapan he gangamdari joda samay kii chook samaaj kii asamanjasata main vyakti kii vivashtaa aadi
 a very beautiful example of this is the Kevat episode of Ramcharitmanas in which the fools who boast of understanding Rama's heart, but Panditamanya Kevat are unable to answer and in a way surrender silently
 yah paristhiti kaa vyang tha
 The absurdity of disguise has been a favorite subject of the patron nuts and clowns and can be easily given in skits, Ramlila, Raslila, "gammat", slapstick etc
 dharmadhvagiyon vesh, andhanukaran karanevaale fashanparaston kaa vesh, "mardaani aurat" kaa vesh, aise betuke vesh hai jo rachana ke vishay ho sakate hai
 The composition of the absurdity of disguise will also be of shallow status, similar to the creation of the absurdity of the figure
 vaani kaa betukapan he haklaana, baat baat par "jo he so" ke sadrush takiyakalam lagaana, shabdaskhalan karnaa, amanvi dhvaniyaan, shekhi ke pralaap, gapbaajee, panditau bhashaa, ganvaaru bhashaa, anek bhashaa ke shabdon kii khichdi, aadi
 The absurdity of behavior is confusing incidents, clumsy actions, exaggerations, character distortions, social tantrums, having some sense of something, sitting or doing things, puppetry etc
 hasyaras kii abhivyanjana ke liye, chaahe vah parihaas kii drushti se ho chaahe uphaas kii drushti se, vyavhaar kaa betukapan hi prachur saamagree pradaan kar saktaa he
 From the point of view of human beings, why humans, dev demons, birds, bedbugs, brooms, tokens, plate rationing etc
 have been successfully run on many subjects
 parantu in vastuon or visheshat: isht devon evam prashasnic vyangon ke saath majaak jahaan tak pritibhav ko lekar hoga, vahiin tak hasyaras kii koti kaa adhikari kaha jayega
 Other compositions can be reached in the category of raudra, vibhats or other juices
 abhivyanjana main pratyaashit kaa vaiparity anek prakaar se dekha or dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 It cannot be explained exactly with words like absurdity, distortion, confusion etc
 yah vah vaakkaushal he jiske liye rachanaakaar main bhi paryaapt pratibha apekshit hoti he or us rachana ke drashtaa, shrota yaa pathak main bhi
 a social who will not have the desire and hope of humor, will not have humor and humor in the nature and will not have the ability to understand the word signals and syntactic organs of the intellect, it should be understood that there is no humor for him
 isi prakaar jis kalakaar main parishkarpriyata, pratyutpannamatitv or shabd taulne kii kala nahin he vah hasyaras kaa safal lekhak nahin ho saktaa
 Successful authors with the help of unexpected verbiage, with the unexpected derivation of the word; With the help of unexpected unique analogies etc
 With the help of singular arguments; With the help of the various genres of Vagvadagdhya, namely, with the change of meaning, with the art of shifting the place of bathing in the Pratyutra; With the help of Satire "", Uddhav's utterance in Krishnayan is the building of Madhupuri, Shyam Bajai Bainu? Bhavniprasad Mishra jiâ€™s songfarosh etc
), with the help of sarcasm; With the help of illogical vows; And many similar expressions express humor from styles
 prabhaav kii drushti se hamaari samaj main hasyaras yaa to visheshat: parihaas kii koti kaa hota he yaa uphaas kii koti kaa
 We have not limited these two words in the traditional sense
 jo santushti pradhan kavy he use ham parihaas kii koti kaa maanate hai or jo sanshuddhi pradhan he use uphaas kii koti kaa
 There is also a mixture of both in many compositions
 parihaas or uphaas donon ke liye saamaajikon kii suruchi kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Fleshy ornamental taste, today's modern society cannot be interesting
 devtaa vishyak vyang sahdharmiyon ko hi hansaane ke liye hua karata he
 Suruchi's attention is very important for ridicule
 majaa isamen hi he ki hasyapatr apni trutiyaan samaj le parantu sanket denevaale kaa anugrihit bhi ho jaae or use upadeshta ke rup main na dekhe
 Without sarcasm, consider humor to be ridiculous, whether it is descriptive, whether the effect of the conversation and the effect shown by sarcasm on oneself or others, especially on others, is ridiculous
 bit, humar, parody aadi ke sahare utpann vah haas jo vishuddh santushti kii koti kaa he, parihaas hi kaha jayega
 From the point of view of humor, humor should be considered as the category of softness or that of Attas
 hasith, apasit aadi anya kotiyon kaa inhen donon main antarbhaav maan lenaa chahie
 Two can also be performed of soft-heartedness, one is the secret haas whose pleasure is taken in mind and the other is Sphut Haas whose smile can be seen by other people as well
 attahas ke bhi do bhed kiye ja sakate hai-ek he maryaadit haas jo hansanevaale kii paristhiti se niyantrit rahata he or doosraa he amaryadit haas jisamen paristhiti saapekshata kaa bhaan nahin rahata
 This interpretation of the differences of humor will probably be more scientific
 naatakon main prahasan kii vidha or vidooshak kii upasthiti ne hasya kaa srijan kiya he kintu vah bahumukhi nahin hone paaya
 Many verses of Subhashit have become good, in which both the subject and utterances have a good sense of humor
 kuch udhaaharan de dena apraasangik na hoga
 See the mockery of the relationship of the gods
 prashn tha ki shankar ji ne jehar kyon piya? kavi kaa uttar he ki apni gruhasthi kii dasha se uubakar

 damaad apni sasuraal ko kitni saar vastu mana karata he parantu phir bhi kis akadabaaji se apni puja karavaate rahane kii apeksha rakhaa karata he ya nimna shlokon main dekhie
 Both verses are poetic enough
 jitna vishleshan kiijie utana hi majaa aata jayega: Pranna be dear that life, listen to the conclusion of the poet on this- raja bhoj ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki jo nayaa shloke rachakar laaegaa use ek lakh mudraayen puraskaar main milengi parantu puraskaar kisi ko milane hi nahin paata tha kyonki use medhaavi darbari pandit nayaa shloke sunate hi duhara dete or is prakaar use purana ghoshit kar dete the
 According to the legend, Kalidas stopped speaking after reciting the following verses
 shloke main kavi ne daawa kiya he ki raja ninnanbe karod ratna dekar pita ko rinmukt karen or isapar panditon kaa sakshya le len
 If the pundits say that this claim is not known to them, then one lakh should be given for the creation of this new verse

 Tulsidas ji's Ramacharimanas' Nardamoh episode, Shiva Vivah episode, Parashurama episode etc
 and Surdas ji's Sarsagar's Makhanchori context, uddhav-gopi-dialogue theme etc
 provide good examples of humor
 tulsidas ji kaa nimna chand, jisamen jarajarjar tapasviyon kii shringarlalasaa par mjedaar chutki lee gai he, apni chata main apurv he- Birbal's jokes, Lal Buzhakkad's hanging, Ghagh and Bhadari's epics, Girdhar Kavirai and Ganga's verses, Beni Kaviraj's Bharove and many other compositions are famous of this period
 bharatjivan press ne is kaal kii footkar hasya rachanaaon kaa kuch sankalan apane "bhadova sangrah" main prakashit kiya tha
 In this period, there have been some poignant works, especially about the theme of charity, whose interestingness can not be said even today

 The main ones are drama and drama, novels and stories, and essays

 bonda raigarh mandal main bharat ke chhattisgarh rajya ke antargat raigarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a computer program is a group of instructions given in a language that the computer understands to do or to do a particular task
 kisi bhi program kii krmanudesan karne ke liye sarvapratham program ke samast nirdishtikaran ko bhalee-bhanti samaj liya jaataa he
 It is also checked whether all the conditions used in the program are being followed properly
 ab program ke sabhi nirdishtikaran ko jaanchane-samajhane ke uparaant program ke shuru se vaanchit parinaam praapt hone tak ke sabhi nirdesho ko vidhivat krambadhd kar liya jaataa he arthath programo kii digining kar lee jaati he
 After thoroughly checking the design of the program, the coding of the program is done and the program is compiled
 program ko test data input karke program kii jaanch kii jaati he ki vastav main sahi parinaam praapt ho rahaa he yaa nahi
 If the results are not true, it means that the order of any instruction of the program is wrong or the instruction is given wrong at some place
 yadi parinaam sahi praapt hota he to program main diye gayi nirdesho ke kram ko ekbadhd kar liya jaataa he evam nirdesho ke is kram ko sanganak me sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 In this way, the entire process of serialization takes place
 kisi bhi ucch koti ke program main nimnaankit lakshan vaanchhneeya hote hai- The process of working of a computer is very complex
 sanganak kii apni smriti to hoti he lekin buddhi nahin hoti
 The computer performs only the task that is directed to it; that is, the intelligence of the work is given to the computer by ordered instructions or programs
 sanganak me program kunjeepatal par tip karke feed kiya jaataa he, program main sanganak ko kya kya, kis prakraar karnaa he, yah spasht evam krambaddh rup main likhaa jaataa he
 Imagine that someone was given the task of making two cups of tea
 ab hame sanganak ko chaay banane se sambandhit sabhi nirdesh nishchit kram main dene honge
 If the instructions are to be given orally then these will be as follows: - 1
 Go to the kitchen
 2
ek cap len
 3
 Open the water basket
 4
cap main pani bharkar totin ko band kar den
 5
 Put the cup on the slab
 6
chaay kaa bhagona len
 7
 Turn the cup water on the slab into a tea cake
 8
chaay kaa bhagona gas burner par rakh de
 9
 Light a gas lighter
 10
ek haath se gas kii nob ko on karen tathaa saath hi liter bhi jalaat
 11 If the gas does not burn, turn the knob off and now repeat the action with serial number 9
 12
yadi gas jal jaati he to chaay ke bhagone ke pani ko tab tak garam hone de jab tak ki vah ubalane na lage
 13
 Tea and sugar box on which tea and sugar are written respectively, during the period of water heating; And keep a spoon with you
 14
 pani ke ubalane par chaay kaa dibba kholkar aadha chammach chaay or uske baad chini kaa dibba kholkar ek chammach chini usame daal de
 15
 Close the tea and sugar boxes and keep them from where they were picked up
 16
ab doodh ke bhagone main se ek cap doodh le len
 17
now add water to the cup after boiling water again
 18
is mishran ke ubalane par gas kii nob ko of kar de
 19
 Take a tray
 20
is trey main do plate alag alag rakhiye
 21
 Place one cup each in plates placed in a tray
 22
ab chaay channi va sandasi le
 23
 Sieve the tea biscuits with the help of a strainer and strain the tea over a cup and filter it till the cup is 80% full
 24
kramank 23 vaali kriya ko duusare cap ke liye doharaaye
 25
 After filling the tea in both the cups, keep the sieve and tea pan in the sink
 aapane dekha ki chaay banane ke liye spasht evam ek nishcchit kram main nirdesh diye gaye
 This instruction is sufficient to make tea even from someone who has never made tea
 isi prakaar sanganak se koi kaary karaane ke liye use spasht evam nishchit kram main nirdesh diye jate hai;or yahi prakriya sanganak krmanudesan he
 The computer only understands machine language
 vibhinn krmanudesan bhashaa main likhe gaye program main nirdesho ko Assembler, compiler athwa Interpreter kii sahaayta se masini bhashaa main parivartit karke sanganak ke micoprocesar main bheja jaataa he
 Only then the computer follows these instructions and produces suitable results
 masini bhashaa maatr byanary anko arthath 0 se 1 ke samooho se bani hoti he jise sanganak kaa micoprocesar sidhe samaj saktaa he
 When we give any instructions to the computer through any input, the computer can automatically convert these instructions into ASCII Code
 nirdesh dene ke liye hame saamanyat: aksharo, sankhyao evam sanketo ke "kies" ko kii-board par dabaanaa hota he or sanganak swatah hi inhe apni bhashaa main badal letaa he
 example-type in machine language -TY PE sanganak ko nirdesh program tareeke se, atyant spasht bhashaa main evam vistaar se dena atyant aavashyak hota he
 a program has to be made and given to the computer to do the work
 diya gaya program jitna spasht, vistrut or sateek hoga, sanganak utane hi sucharu rup se kaary karegaa, utani hi kam galtiyaa karegaa or utane hi sahi uttar degaa
 If the program is unclear and does not have proper details and clear instructions, then it is possible that the computer continues to calculate without extracting the result or the result obtained from it is unclear and meaningless
 atah program atyant saavdhaanee or ekagrachit hokar taiyaar karnaa chaiye
 The overall functionality of the computer depends on the capacity of the person making the program
 sanganak me apni koi budhdi nahin hoti
 It is a brainless and very obedient machine
 yadi use koi nirdesh nahin diya jaataa athwa aspasht nirdesh diya jaataa he tab bhi vah koi aapatti nahin karata or die gaye nirdeshaanusaar hi kaary karata he
 Therefore, extreme caution is required while making the program
 sanganak par program banaate samay nimna batoo ko dhyaan main rakhana aavadhyak he:- It is advisable to present the instructions in the program as a flow table
 isame yah spasht hona chaiye ki sanganak ko kab or kya karnaa he evam use vibhinn kriyaaye kis rup main kerani he
 The program is shown in the form of a flow diagram from top to bottom and where logic etc
 has to be done, it is divided into two parts
 program main nirdesho ko sanganak kii samaj main aane vaali bhashaa main likhnaa aavashyak hota he; taaki sanganak pradutt nirdesho ko samaj sake or unke anusaar kaary karke vaanchit parinaam prastut kar sake
 Once the program is written in the computer language, it is put in the memory of the computer ie on the input devices such as floppy, magnetic lace, perforated card etc
 saath hi yah samasya ko hal karne ke liye aavashyak data bhi sanganak kii input unit ko pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Now the computer works according to that program and displays the analysis of the input data to produce the appropriate result
 yadi program main praapt parinamo ko monitor screen par pradarshit karne athwa flopy, harddisk yaa chumbakeey feete par ankit karne ke nirdesh diye gaye hai tab sanganak praapt parinamo ko vahiin ankit kar detaa he
 Program translatorcompile gir vanyajeev abhayaarany bharat ke gujarat main rajya sthit rashtriya udyaan evam vanyapraani abhayaarany he, jo asia main singhon kaa ekmaatr nivas sthaan hone ke kaaran janaa jaataa he
 The Gir Sanctuary is spread over 1424 sq km, with a national park of 258 sq km and an extension of 1153 sq km reserved for wildlife
 iske atirikt paas main hi mitiyala vanyajeev abhayaarany he jo 18
22 kilometre main failaa hua he
 Both these reserved expansions are part of Junagadh, Amreli and Gir Somnath districts in Gujarat
 singhdarshan ke liye ye udyaan evam abhayaarany vishwa main pravaasiyon ke liye aakarshan kaa centre he
 In order to deal with the problem of decreasing number of lions in the world and to protect the Asiatic lions, this expansion was declared as the only habitat of lions
 vishwa main africa ke baad isi vistaar main singh bache hai
 The Gir forest was declared as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1969 and six years later it was expanded to 140
4 square kilometers and established as a national park
 yah abhyaarany ab lagbhag 258
71 varg kilometre tak vistrut ho chukaa he
 As a result of many efforts to provide protection to wildlife, the number of lions in this sanctuary has increased to 312 now
 gir vanyajeev abhayaarany kaa itihaas 100 saalon se adhik purana he or isaki purvabhumika pracheen itihaas ke saath sambandh rakhti he
 The lion species has been important in ancient times in India and other stretches and in folklore, where is the lion king of the forest
 pracheen pratiko main bhi singh kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In Sanatan Dharma, the vehicle of Maa Amba is Leo
 baad main singhon kii prajati na keval bharat kintu asia ke vistaar se vilupt hone lagi or san 1900 ke aasapaas keval gujarat kshetra main maatr 15 singh hi bache the
 Then the hunting of lions was banned by the then Nawab of Junagadh declaring the Gir area reserved for lions
 pracheen kaal main puure bharat or asia ke duusare deshon main bhi singh paye jate the
 Singapore derives its name from the word lion, which means the city of lions
 bharat ke pracheen granthon main raajaaon ke dwaara bahaduree dikhaane ke liye singhon ke shikaar kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Some people in India also keep their surname as Singh
 singh ko shaury or veerta kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Due to the problems of hunting of lions, cutting of forests, lack of suitable environment for lions, problems of water and food, the lion species gradually started disappearing from India
 bharat main gir ke alaava anya vistaar main jivit haalat main singh isvisan 1984 main paaya gaya tha, jiskaa ullekh darj kiya gaya he
 Probably lions became extinct around 1840 in Bihar, 1885 in eastern Vindhyas and Bundelkhand, 1834 in Delhi, 1842 in Bhawalpur, 1870 in Central India and Rajasthan and 1880 in western extension
 1900 main keval gujarat main hi singh rah gaye or jivit singho kii sankhya maatr 15 thi tab junagarh ke tatkaaleen nawab ke dwaara gir vistaar ko abhayaarany ke rup main ghoshit kiya or shikaar par pabandi laga di
 After that the lions have grown in Gir and the number of lions has increased
 pichley kuch varsho main gir ke jangalon se kudarti reet se sinhone amarelli jile ke kuch vistaaron main sthanantaran kiya or is vistaar ko bhi apana nivas sthaan banaaya
 After Junagadh district, maximum lions are found in Amreli district
 gujarat sarkaar dwaara pravaasiyon ke liye ambarady park kaa bhi nirmaan hua he
 The Gir Sanctuary extension consists of cold, hot and tropical rainy seasons
 ushn ritu main yahan kii aabhohawaa bahut hi garam rahati he
 The mercury in the second hour ranges from 43 Â° to 4 Â° C
 sheet ritu main taapmaana kaa paara 10Â° se tak neeche chalaa jaataa he
 There is more evidence of sending it to the climate during the rainy season
 saamanytah yahan varsha ritu kaa aarambh june ke madhya se hota he or sitambar tak barish hoti he
 It rains up to 1000 mm of water in a year
 kabhi kabhi akaal bhi padataa he
 The winter season is from December to March
 april se ushntaman bad jaataa he or june ke kuch dinon tak garmi kaa mausam rahata he
 In addition to dry tree trees, thorny shrubs, Gir forest rich in lush green trees is situated on the banks of the river
 yahaan ke mukhya vrikshon main sagwan, shisham, babul, ber, jamun, bill aadi he
 The Gir Sanctuary is originally famous for lions, although India's largest deer, sambar, chital, nilgai, chinkara and reindeer can also be seen here as well as bears and big-tailed langurs
 gir bharat kaa ek acha pakshi abhayaarany bhi he
 Fruits of eagle, woodpecker, ariole, wild myna and paradise flycatcher can also be seen here
 saath hi yah adholia, waldera, ratanghuna or piplia aadi pakshiyon ko bhi dekhne ke liye upyukt sthaan he
 Forms for crocodiles are being developed in this forest
 1427 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1427 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 1427 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyug Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 rugveda-samhita rigvaidic vaanmay kaa mantra-bhaag he
 It has 1017 letters
 ise vishwa kaa pracheenatam granth mana jaataa he
 According to scholars, the Rigveda is more than 3500 years old
 chaaron vedon main sarvocch sthaan rugveda ko hi praapt he
 The Rigveda has the distinction of being the oldest book in the world
 vaidic vaanmay main rugveda ko param poojyaneey mana jaataa he or vasant puja aadi ke avasar par sarvapratham vedapth rugveda se hi prarambh kiya jaataa he
 In the Purusukta, in the Vedamantras originating from the Adi Purusha, 'rik' is first counted
 rugveda kii samhita ko 'riksanhita' kehete hai
 In fact, 'rik' means - 'stuti Mantra' and 'samhita' means compilation
 at: richaon ke sankalan kaa naam 'riksanhita' he
 The definition of Rik is given - Richyante Stuyante Deva Anaya Iti Rik; That is, the one who praises the gods is called 'rik'
 ek duusari vyakhya ke anusaar chhandon main bandhi rachana ko 'ruk' naam diya jaataa he
 In the Brahmana texts, Rika has been called Brahm, Vak, Prana, Amrit etc
 which means that the mantras of Rigveda are the means of attaining Brahm, the recipient of Vak, the attainment of Pran or Tej and the means of immortality
 saamaanya rup se isse rugveda ke mantron kii mahima kaa grahan kiya janaa chahie
 According to the great legend of Patanjali, the Rigveda probably had 21 branches
 inamen se 'charanvyuuh' naamak granth main ullakhit ye paanch shakhaaen pramukh maani jaati hai- shakal, vaashkal, aashvalayani, shankhayani or manduqayani
 Currently, the code of a branch of the Rig Veda is obtained
 yah samhita kari drushtiyon se atyadhik mahatvapurn he
 This Samhita has the distinction of being the first book of world literature, being the oldest text of the entire Vedic tradition
 chaaron vedon kii samhitaon kii tulana main yah sabase badi samhita he
 It is a source of wonderful and varied knowledge in the form of a giant Vedic text
 bhav, bhashaa or chand kii drushit se bhi yah atyant pracheen he
 In this, most of the gods Indra, Vishnu, Marut etc
 are representative of natural elements
 ye panchatattvon- agin, vaayu, aadi tathaa megh, vidyut, surya aadi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In all the Vedas and Brahmana texts, the name of the Rigveda or its Samhita is first counted
 phir anek vishyon kii vyapak charchaa karne ke kaaran is samhita kaa varnyavishayparak mahatva bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The Samhita of the Rigveda is a collection of the Ritchas
 riksanhita kaa vibhaajan do prakaar se kiya jaataa he- ashtak-kram or mandal-kram
 The entire Samhita is divided into eight octaves under the octave and each octave has eight chapters
 adhyay virgon main vibhajit hai or varg ke antargat richaayen hai
 The total number of chapters is 64 and the number of sections is 2006
 mandal-kram main sampoorn samhita main das mandal hai
 There are many verses in each circle, many verses in each verse, and many mantras in each verse
 tadnusaar rugveda-samhita main 10 mandal, 85 anuwak, 1028 sookt or 10552 mantra he
 In this way a beautiful and certain system of division of the mantra-samhita of the Rigveda is obtained
 rugveda-samhita ke mantradrashtaa rishiyon par yadi dhyaan diya jaae, to ham pate hai ki duusare se saatven mandal ke antargat samavisht mantra kisi ek rishi ke dwaara hi saakshaatkaar kiye gayi he
 That is why these divisions are called lineages
 in mandalon ko duusare mandalon kii tulana main pracheen mana jaataa he
 Although many scholars disagree with this view
 aathven mandal main kanv, bhrigu aadi kuch pariwaron ke mantra sankalit hai
 In the first and tenth circles, the sukta-numbers are the same
 donon main 191 sookt hi hai
 The notable feature of both these circles is that it has compiled mantras interviewed by many sages
 pehle or dasven mandal main vibhinn vishyon ke sookt hai
 Often scholars consider both these circles to be relatively ancient
 navaan mandal bhi kuch vishesh mahatva liye hue he
 In it all the mantras of Soma Devta have been compiled
 isiilie iskaa doosraa prachlit naam he- pavamaan mandal
 For the sake of convenience, the details of the mandalas, suktakas and sages of the Rigveda Code are given in the following table
 in mantron ke drashtaa-rishiyon main gritsamad, vishwamitra, vamdev, atri, bharadwaj, vasishtha, bhrigu or angira pramukh hai
 Many Vedic women have also been the watchers of mantras
 pramukh rishikaaon ke rup main vaak ambhrini, surya, savitri, sarparaji, yami, vaivaswathi, urvashi, lopamudra, ghosha aadi ke naam ullekhneey he
 a total of 20 verses are used in the Rigveda Samhita
 inamen bhi pramukh chand saat hai
 These are inamen bhi in chaar chhandon ke mantron kii sankhya is samhita main sabase adhik paari jaati he- trishtup, gayatri, jagati or anushtup
 The Rig Veda details the social, political, economic system and institutions of the then society
 isamen unke darshanik, aadhyatmik kalatmak tathaa vaigyanik vichaaron kaa samavesh bhi he
 Gods and gods and goddesses had an important place in the life of Vedic sages
 rugveda kaa prayek mantra kisi na kisi devtaa se sambaddh he
 In reality, deity means subject matter
 tabhi chura or ookhal jaisi vasteen bhi devtaa he
 Axis and agriculture are also deities
 rugveda kii samhita main devstuti kii pradhanta he
 Eulogy, Indra, Marut, Usha, Som, Ashivanou, etc
 are offered hymns in many hymns of various gods

 Apart from devotions in Rikasamhita, there are also other topics on the topic, such as 'aksushakaat' depicting the plight of the gambler, 'jnanasukta', which depicts the importance of speech and knowledge, 'yamaayami-', presenting the dialogue of Yama and Yami
 Dialogues', 'pururava urvashi-dialogues', etc
, highlighting the conversation between Pururava and Urvashi

 Rigveda-samhita's verses are often divided on the basis of the subject and style in this way- devstutiparakasukt Philosophical book loukik sookt Dialog box aakhyaan sookt aadi
 a brief introduction by some prominent Suktas, which are highly popular and important, sheds light on the broader subject of this Samhita
 samvaad sookhton kii vyakhya or taatpary vaidic vidwaanon kaa ek vichaarneey vishay rahaa he; kyonki vaartalap karne waalon ko maatr vyakti maananaa sambhav nahin he
 The elements contained in these narratives and dialogues have given rise to the narrative and drama genres of literature in the postwar period
 iske atirikt, aprisukt, danstutisukt, aadi kuch duusare sookt bhi apni style or vishay ke kaaran pruthak rup se ulilakhit kiye jate hai
 Thus, in addition to the praises of the Vedic deities, the Samhita of the Rig Veda is the oldest Aasha Granth to throw light on the difference between philosophy, cosmic knowledge, environment, science, narration and so on

 Spectrometry is a branch of physics in which the spectrum of electromagnetic radiations emitted or absorbed by matter is studied and from this study knowledge of the intrinsic composition of substances is obtained
 is shakha main mukhya rup se varnakram kaa hi adhyayan hota he at: ise spectrumiki yaa spectrumvigyaan kehete hai
 Originally, the study of the interaction between radiation and matter was called spectroscopy or spectroscopy
 vastut: aitihaasik rup se drushya prakaash kaa kisi prism se guzarane par alag-alag aavritiyon kaa alag-alag raste par janaa hi spectroscopy kehalaata tha
 The meaning of the term 'spectroscopy' later expanded
 ab tarangadairdhya ke falan ke rup main kisi bhi raashi kaa maapan spectroscopy kehalaati he
 Its definition was further expanded when energy was included as a variable amount kisi raashi kaa aavriti ke falan ke rup main aalekh varnakram kehalaata he
 The measurement of the density of the presence of ions, atoms or molecules in a mass of a substance is called spectrometry
 jo upkaran spectrometry main sahaayak hote hai ve spectrometer, spectrophotometer yaa spectrograph aadi naamon se jane jate hai
 Spectroscopy / spectrometry is often used in physical and analytical chemistry
 iskaa upyog khagol vigyaan evam sudur samvedan main bhi hota he
 The foundations of spectroscopy were laid by Isaac Newton in 1666 AD
 unhone ek band kamare main khidki ke chhidr se aate hue saura kiranpunj ko ek prism se hokar parde par jane diya
 Seven colors on the curtain were purple
 pattee main saato rang - laal, naarangi, pilaa, haraa, aasamaani, nila or bangnee - isi kram main dikhaai padate the
 Newton called this strip "spectrum"
 is prayog se unhone yah siddh kiya ki surya kaa shwet prakaash vastav main saat rangon kaa mishran he
 For a long time, "spectrum" was used to refer to this color band
 baad main vaigyanikon ne yah dekha ki saura spectrum ke bangnee rang se neeche bhi kuch rashmiyaan pai jaati hai jo aankh se nahin dikhaai padati hai parantu photoplate par prabhaav daalati hai or unka photo liya ja saktaa he
 These rays are called ultraviolet rays
 isi prakaar laal rang se upar avarakt kirane pai jaati hai
 Actually, the colors of all the characters are electromagnetic waves
 rangeen prakaash, avarakt, parabangnee prakaash, eks-kiran, gamma-kiran, micro tarangen tathaa radio tarangen - ye sabhi vidyucchumbakeey tarangen hai
 They all have a spectrum
 paare ko uttejit karne se jo hare rang kii kirane nikalati hai unka tarangadairghy 5461 angsterom hota he
 So now the colors of different colors are divided not on the basis of color but on the wavelength and the meaning of spectrum has become very broad - the arrangement of the colors according to the wavelength is called spectrum
 spectrumvigyaan kaa sambandh praaia: sabhi prakaar kii vidyucchumbakeey tarangon se he
 Microwave spectrum spectroscopy, infrared-spectroscopy, field of view spectroscopy, X-ray spectrometry and nuclear-spectroscopy are all part of spectroscopy, but in the prevailing sense, spectroscopy includes the study of spectrum of infrared, visible and ultraviolet rays
 newton ne surya kii kirnon se jo "spectrum" praapt kiya tha vah shuddh nahin tha arthath sabhi rang pasavaale rang se purnat: pruthak nahin the; ek rang duusare se mila tha
 The reason for this was that they poured rays from a round hole to the prism
 san 1802 i
 main volaston ne gol chhidr ke sthaan par sankri jhirri kaa prayog karke shuddh spectrum praapt kiya
 Later on, Joseph Fraunhofer obtained a pure spectrum with the help of prism and invented plane grating
 grating ek doosraa upkaran he jo vibhinn varna kii rashmiyon ko parikshepit kar detaa he
 The work of Fraunhofer assumes special significance in the advancement of spectroscopy
 san 1859 i
 main kirkhaaf or bunshan ne bahut se shuddh tattvon kaa spectrum liya or yah bataaya ki ve ek duusare se sarvatha bhinn hote hai
 Kirkhoff and Bunshan also proved that a substance whose properties can give when stirred, can give only the colors of the same character at low temperatures, but can also absorb only the colors of the same character at low temperatures
 in tatwon kii jaankaree ke baad spectrumiki kii pragati badi tivrata se hui
 This science has contributed immensely in acquiring knowledge of the formation of atomic molecules
 kisi padaarth ko vidyut yaa ooshmaa dekar uttejit kiya jaataa he tab usase prakaash nikalne lagata he
 The spectrum of rocks released from that substance depends on its internal structure
 kisi thos padaarth ko itnaa garam kiya jaae ki vah teevr chamak dene lage to usase jo spectrum praapt hota he use satat spectrum kehete hai kyonki isamen vibhinn varna kii pattiyaan ek duusari se mili juli rahati hai, unki koi seemaa nahin pai jaati he
 Similar spectrum is obtained from electric bulb and sun
 iske vipareet yadi kisi padaarth ko itani adhik urja di jaae ki use parmaanu uttejit ho jaaen to usase rekhiy spectrum miltaa he
 There are sharp lines of different colors in it
 vidyut arq tathaa kuch taron se bhi rekhiy spectrum praapt hota he
 There is also a third category of spectrum
 yadi kisi gas main kam dabaav par vidyut visarjan kiya jaae to ve gaisen uttejit hokar sapatt spectrum detii hai
 In this spectrum, several plates are found apart from each other, one end of which is sharp and the other is tarnished respectively
 ye sabhi spectrum utsarjit spectrum kahe jate hai
 If all the colors of the letter are sent from within a substance, it absorbs those quantities which it can emit itself
 bijli ke balve se drishyakshetra kii sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai
 If there is a steam of sodium in a tube and by sending the light of the bulb from within it, the spectrum of outward light is taken, then two black lines are found in its yellow part
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki sodium swayan uttejit hone par rekhiy spectrum detaa he
 There are also two yellow lines in this spectrum called the "D" lines of sodium
 jab balb kaa prakaash sodium kii bhaap se hokar jaataa he to sodium di rekhaon ke anukool varna ko avashoshit kar letaa he or barhigat prakaash main isi sthaan par do kaali rekhaayen ban jaati hai
 This spectrum is called the absorption spectrum
 avasorana spectrum bhi teen prakaar ke hote hai
 The absorption spectrum in which the black lines are found is called the linear absorption spectrum, in which the black bands are found, the band absorption spectrum and in which only a slightly more continuous region of the spectrum is absorbed is called the continuous absorption spectrum
 spectrum praapt karne ke liye jin upkarnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he unhen spectrumdarshi, spectrummapi or spectrumlekhi kehete hai
 Each spectrographic spectroscope has three main components
 pehla bhaag strot se aanevaali rashmiyon ko uchit disha main niyantrit karata he, doosraa bhaag vibhinn varnon ko pruthak karata arthath mishrit rashmiyon ko parikshepit karata he tathaa teesraa bhaag unhen alag alag ek nabhital par focus karata he
 If the device only has a system of viewing the spectrum, then it is called a spectroscope, if there is also a system of reading the deviation of different characters of the spectrum by rotating its third part, then it is called a spectrometer, from which a permanent picture of the spectrum can be taken
 sabhi spectrolekhi banaavat main lagbhag samaan hote hai kintu parikshepan ke liye do saadhan kaam main laae jate hai - prism or grating
 Hence spectrographs are also of two types - prism spectrograph and grating spectrograph
 adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye spectrum ko vibhinn kshetron main baant liya gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of three things - Rashmisrot, reflection method and recording
 spectrumiki vibhaag main nimnaankit kshetron kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he - sudur avaraktakiran drishyakshetra, parabangnee kshetra or nirvaat parabangnee kshetra
 Different types of spectrography are used in different parts
 sarini main vibhinn kshetron kii seemaa, parikshepan yantra or abhilekhan yantron kaa sankshipt vivaran diya gaya he- There are three types of spectrum - linear, banded and continuous
 rekhiy spectrum main kel rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 In the banded spectrum, band bands are found, one edge of which is sharp and the other is tarnished respectively
 satat spectrum main sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan ek duusare se sanlagn rahati hai
 Suitable amount of spectrum is used to obtain various spectrums
 rekhiy spectrum uttejit parmaanuon dwaara praapt hota he
 They require heat, electric or highly energetic electromagnetic rings to excite
 saamanyat: vidyut arq or vidyut spark upyog main aate hai
 Atoms are also excited by flame, heat furnace and electric immersion
 vidyut arq - dhaatu ke do electrode ek vishesh prakaar ke stambh main kas die jate hai kintu stambh se pruthgnyast rahete hai
 The space between the electrodes can be reduced or increased by rotating a screwhead
 donon electrode ek parivartaneey avrodh tathaa ek prerakatv shreneekram main jod die jate hai
 Initially both electrodes are connected to drive the arc, so the electrical circuit is completed and current starts flowing
 jahaan electrode satate hai us bindu par bheeshan ooshmaa ootpann hoti he kyonki vahaan avrodh atyant kam hone se sahasaa hajaaron ampior kii dhara pravaahit hoti he
 This heat causes the electrode to evaporate, and even after slightly dissolving them, this steam continues to complete the electrical circuit
 is bhaag main sthit anu-parmaanu uttejit hokar prakaash dene lagate hai
 Arc temperature is about 3500 c From 8000 cm Happens till
 mukhya taar arq chalaane ke purv electrodon ke bich kaa vibhavantar main ke vibhavantar ke baraabar hota he kintu arq chalate samay yah ghat jaataa he
 Arcs are also run from the alternating stream
 aajkal kai prakaar ke sudhare hue arq uplabdh hai
 Electric blasting - is almost like an arc, but the difference of the electrodes of the blasting is several hundred times greater than the arc
 yahi kaaran he ki sphuling kaa stambh adhik surakshit tathaa electrodon se bhalee bhanti pruthgnyast rakhaa jaataa he
 The electrodes are connected to the secondary ends of a stop-up transformer
 sphuling rikt sthaan kaa vibhavantar 10,000 wo
 se 50,000 volt tak hota he; at: is strot main anu-parmaanuon ko atyadhik uttejnaa milti he
 Sphaling spaces can be increased or subtracted at will
 is strot main uttejit honevaale anu parmaanuon ko bahut adhik urja praapt hoti he
 Hence they are ionized
 parmaanu yaa anu ke cendrak ke chaaron or bahut se electron ghoomte rahete hai
 These electrons are divided into different orbits according to certain rules
 sabase baharwali kaksha ke electranon ko "optical electron" kaha jaataa he
 If one or more optical electrons are removed from a molecule or atom, it is said to be "ionized"
 keval ek electron nikal jane par parmaanu pehali ynit sthiti main ho jaataa he
 If the second, third etc
 electrons are also removed, the atom goes into the second, third etc
 ionized position respectively
 in sthitiyon ke liye uttarottar adhik urja deni hoti he
 The 23rd ionized state of tin has been achieved by extremely high-intensity sphilling
 spectro rasinic vishleshan ke liye vidyut sphuling mukhya rup se upyogi hota he
 a variety of improvements have been made to keep the sphincter running continuously
 padaarthon ko prajvalit karne yaa bunsan jwalk kii jwaala main jalaane par pattdaar spectrum praapt hota he
 Plated spectrum can also be obtained by igniting some substances in an electric arc
 gaison main vidyut visarjan se pattdaar spectrum badi suvidha se praapt hote hai
 For electric immersion, filling the gas in a tube at very low pressure has to give a difference of several thousand volts between its ends
 nion gas main vidyut visarjan se rakt varna kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai
 Now-a-days immersion tubes of the size of letters and pictures are made for display and publicity in which neon gas is filled
 inhen nion sin kehete hai
 If a solid substance is given so much heat that it starts glowing red then it continuously emits Rashmipunj
 bijli ke balve se drishyakshetra main satat spectrum paane ke liye vishesh prakaar ke hydrogen lamp, zeenaan arq lamp tathaa paarad-vaashp visarjan kaam main laae jate hai
 Spectrographs are used to obtain a permanent spectrum of the sorghum emitted from different types of spermatozoa
 prayek spectrolekhi main laayaa hua parikshepan sanyantr vibhinn varna kii mishrit rashmiyon ko pruthak kar detaa he
 The dispersion of stones is in three ways: jab rashmiyaan kisi prism se hokar jaati hai tab apvartan ke kaaran pruthak ho jaati hai
 This is called refractory reflection; yadi bahut si sankri jhiriyon ko ek duusari ke samaantar paas paas rakhkar unamem se mishrit prakashpunj bheja jaae to vivartan ke kaaran rashmiyaan alag alag ho jaati hai or spectrum ban jaataa he
 Such dispersion is called invertible reflection; rashmiyon ke vyatikaran dwaara bhi parikshepan utpann kiya jaataa he
 The first two methods are more common
 iske teen mukhya bhaag hote hai - collemetter, prism or camera
 a collimator is a hollow tube with a thin end on one end and a lens on the other end
 zairi or lens kii duuri parivartaneey hoti he tathaa zairi kii chaudaai bhi parivartaneey hoti he tathaa zairi kii chaudaai bhi parivartaneey hoti he
 The prism is thus placed on a firm base
 ki lens se aanevaala samaantar rashmipunj isapar pade
 The spheres reflected from the prism go into the camera and are focused on the photoplatte by the camera lens
 puri vyavastha ek saath is prakaar dhaki rahati he ki zairi ke atirikt or kahin se bhi prakaash bheetar na ja sake
 Such are the spectrographs generally used in the visual and ultraviolet fields
 drishyakshetra main kaam aanevaale spectrolekhi main kaanch ke lens or prism lage rahete hai
 Prisms and lenses of quartz, fluoride, and fluoride are used for the ultraviolet region
 duurastha avarakt ke liye upyogi prism nahin milte hai
 Spectrographs with two or three prisms are designed to increase the deflection
 nirvaat parabangnee kshetra ke liye aise spectrograph kaam aate hai jinase vaayu nikaal di jaati he
 These are called vacuum spectrographs
 ye bade moolyawaan hote hai
 Special types of spectrometers are used for infrared
 infrared spectrometer se kisi padaarth kaa shoshan varnakram praapt hota he
 Continuous infrared rocks are allowed to pass through the material
 padaarth se nikalne ke baad inhen prism yaa grating se vikshepit kiya jaataa he
 The deflected rocks are recorded by thermoelectric recorders
 in spectrometeron main chloride tathaa fluoride ke prism lage rahete hai or lenson ke sthaan par dhaatu kii kalivaale darpan lagaae jate hai
 The grating that is formed by keeping several narrow wrinkles parallel is called grating
 yadi svachh paardarshak kaanch par samaantar rekhaayen khurch di jaaen to pratyak do rekhaon ke bich kaa paardarshak sthaan zairi kaa kaam detaa he
 Such glass is called flat permeable grating
 inkaa upyog prism kii hi bhanti simit he
 If aluminum or silver is cut on a curved surface and parallel lines are scraped on it, this device is called concave reflective grating
 prayek do rekhaon ke bich kaa tal rashmiyon ko paravartit kar detaa he, inhen paravartit rashmiyon ke vivartan se spectrum praapt hota he
 This type of grating was first created by Henry Roland in 1882 AD
 rekhaayen khurachne ke liye rolland ne ruling mashin bhi banaai thi jo sudhaare hue rup main ab bhi prachlit he
 Curve grating spectrography does not require a lens
 rashmipunj ek sankri zairi se hokar grating par padataa he
 Reflected springs are automatically centered on a circle
 is vrutt ko "rolland vrutt" kehete hai
 The curve on which the lines are scratched is called "grating black"
 rolland vrutt kaa ardhavyas "blike" ke vakrathardhavyas kaa aadha hota he
 This circle touches the grating at the point where its diameter is normal to the grating
 isi abhilamb ke duusare sire par zairi kaa pratyaksh bimb banataa he
 This is called zero-grade spectrum
 iske donon ore rolland vrutt par jo sarvapratham spectrum paae jate hai unhen pratham koti kaa spectrum kaha jaataa he
 Several spectrums of low intensity are found on the same circle and further respectively
 inhen kramash: dwitiya, tritiy aadi koti kaa spectrum kaha jaataa he
 The utility of a spectrograph depends on two things
 pehali uski parikshepan kshamta or duusari vibhedan kshamta he
 The more wavelengths of different wavelengths separated by each dispersion plant as they exit the spectral plant, the higher the reflectivity of that spectrograph
 isi prakaar do atyant sameepvarti tarangadairghy kii rekhaon ko ek duusari se thik thik alag dikhaane kii kshamta ko vibhedankshmata kehete hai
 If two lines are taken in a spectrum in which the wavelength of one is Î» { \ displaystyle { \ lambda}} and the other is Î» { \ displaystyle { \ lambda}} + Î´ Î» { \ displaystyle { \ Delta \ lambda}} more In the differential spectrograph, the two lines appear to be distinct from each other, but in the less differential spectrograph, only one line appears
 vibhedankshmata ko nimnlikhit anupaat dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 r = Î» Î´ Î» { \ displaystyle r = { \ lambda \ over \ Delta \ lambda}} spectrolekhi main parikshepit rashmiyon kaa photo utaar liya jaataa he
 This is called a spectrograph
 jahaan photo nahin utaara ja saktaa he vahaan rashmiyon kaa abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 The tools used for photographing and recording are called "dictators"
 spectramiki ke vibhinn kshetron main vibhinn prakaar ke dictator kaam main laae jate hai
 Interferometer is used to determine the wavelength of a monochromatic resin very accurately
 faverypero interpherometer or micelson interpherometer is kaary ke liye atyadhik upyogi hote hai
 The wavelength of all the lines is difficult and often unambiguous to be determined from the personometer, so the sharp and sharp lines of an element are considered to be the primary standard and with this the wavelengths of other lines are determined
 kadgium tatv kii jaal rekha kaa tarangadairghy 6438
4696 a ko praathmik maanak mana gaya he
 Recently, many scientists have decided to consider 5015
6784 as the primary standard for helium gas
 shuddh louh tathaa viral gaison ke tarangadairghy gaun maadak maane jate hai
 When taking a photo of a spectrum, the photoplot is taken in-place, taking the spectrum of the main spectrum as well as the iron or copper electrocard and comparing it with the lines, with the help of formulas, determine the wavelength of the spectrum's lines or bands
 goes
 rekhaon kii parsparik dooriyaan camparator naamak upkaran kaa sahaayta se maapi jaati hai
 Each atom has a nucleus
 iske chaaron ore kai electron niyat kakshaon main ghoomte rahete hai
 The total number of electrons is equal to the number of ports of the nucleus
 bhinn-bhinn kakshaon main electranon kii sankhya bhi niyat hoti he
 Any electron can remain in a fixed orbit
 vastav main ye kakshaayen parmaanu kii urjasthiti kii dyotak hoti hai
 If an electron moves to another empty orbit, the energy state of the atom changes
 bhitari kakshaon ke electranon kaa hatana praaia: sambhav nahin hota he kintu antim kaksha kaa electron bahari ooshmaa yaa vidyut shakti se uttejit hone par agali kaksha main ja saktaa he
 If the energy associated with it is K1 in the first orbit and K2 in the next orbit, then the electron can only take K2 - K1 energy to move from the first to the second higher energy state
 uttejit str par jane ke baad hi vah pun: purvasthiti main waapas aata he or k2 - k1 urja utsarjit karata he
 The value of this emitted or absorbed energy is only hn, that is, the electron can take or give a fixed energy point to move or return from one energy level to the next energy level
 isse kam urja kaa aadan-pradaan nahin ho saktaa he
 h is a constant number and n is the frequency of emission emitted
 h n arg urja kaa ek packet yaa "kwantum" kaha jaataa he
 Likewise, when electrons transition to other energetics, different frequencies are obtained and corresponding lines are formed in the spectrum
 anu, parmaanuon main electranon kii vyavastha ke anusaar kai electranik urjaster paae jate hai or electranik sankraman ke kaaran vibhinn prakaar ke spectrum praapt hote hai
 Only electronic energy states are found in atoms
 at: electranon ke sankraman se nishchit tarangadairghy kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai or rekhiy spectrum praapt hota he
 Molecules have three types of energy - electronic, vibrational and rotational
 electranik urja kaa maan or bhi kam hota he
 Just as electronic energy states are fixed, similarly vibrational and rotational energy conditions are also fixed
 at: kampanjnya sankraman se patt yaa band praapt hota he
 The lines are obtained from the rotational transition in each bed
 ye bahut paas paas hoti hai at: chote spectrodarshi se alag-alag nahin dikhaai padati hai or spectrum main vibhinn varna ke band hi dikhaai padate hai
 These lines can be seen from spectroscopes with high reflectivity and resolution
 do se adhik parmanuwale anuon kii ghunan rekhaayen or bhi paas-paas hoti hai at: unhen dekhnaa kathin hota he
 It has not been possible to see the rotating lines of polyatomic molecules yet
