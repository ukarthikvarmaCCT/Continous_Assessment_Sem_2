 The inter-government panel sitting on climate change concludes that "the increase in the world's average temperature since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to man-made greenhouse gases
" jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana main lagaataar ho rahi vishwavyaapee badhotaree ko 'global varming' kaha ja rahaa he
 Our earth receives heat from the sun's rays
 ye kirane vayumandal se guzarati huin dharti kii sataha se takaraati hai or phir vahiin se paravartit hokar pun: laut jaati hai
 The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several gases, including some greenhouse gases

 It is worth noting that at least 16 degree Celsius temperature is necessary for humans, creatures and plants to survive

 In such a situation, this cover starts to prevent more rays of the sun and then from here the effects of global warming begin

 global varming ke anya prabhaavon main krishi upaj main parivartan, vyapaar margon main sanshodhan, glacier kaa peeche hatana, prajatiyon ke vilupt hone kaa khatra aadi shaamil hai
 "global warming" refers to the warming in recent decades and its persistence, and its indirect effects on humans
 jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra samjhaute kii ruparekha main "maanav dwaara kiye gaye parivartanon ke liye "jalwaayu parivartan or anya parivartano ke liye "jalwaayu parivartanshiltaa" shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 The term "climate change" assumes that rising temperatures are not the only effect
 The term "anthropogenic global warming" is used many times when the focus is on human-induced change

 One such hypothesis proposes that heat can be a result of solar activity in different forms
 baadhyataa kaa koi bhi prabhaav taatkaalik nahin he
 The heat inertia of the Earth's oceans and the slow response to many indirect effects mean the Earth's current temperature is not in equilibrium with the pressure exerted on it
 Studies of climate commitment show that if greenhouse gases are stabilized at 2000 levels So to some extent even beyond this
 garmi dikhaai degi The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fournier and was first quantitatively investigated in 1896 by Scenti Arness
 yah prakriya dwaara jo avasorana or utsarjan ke avarakt vikiran dwaara vaataavaran main garm gaisen vaataavaran main ek or grah kii sataha kam he
 The existence as a greenhouse effect is thus not disputed
 swaabhaavik rup se green house gaison ke paas hone kaa matlab he ek garmi ke prabhaav ke bare main 33 degree celsius, jo prithvi par rahane yogya nahin honge
 
 Important greenhouse gases on the earth are water vapor, which produces 36–70 percent greenhouse effect); carbon dioxide that produces up to 9–26 percent greenhouse effect; methane up to 4-9 percent and ozone, which produces up to 3-7 percent effect
 The issue is how the power of the greenhouse effect changes when atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases increase from human activity
 audyogic kranti ke baad se maanvi gatividhi main vruddhi hui he jiske kaaran green house gaison ki maatra main bahut jiyaada vruddhi hui he, iske kaaran vikaranshil baadhya CO se2, methane, tropospheric ozon, siefasi or s nitrous bhi bahut bad gaye hai Iagara anu ki drushti se dekhen to methane greenhouse gasccharbon dioxide kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he, par uski sandratha itani kam he ki uskaa vikaranshil jor carbon dioxide ki tulana main keval ek chauthai he praaqatik rup se utpann hone vaali kuch duusari gaise greenhouse prabhaav main yogadan detii hai
 One of these nitrous oxide is developing due to human activities like agriculture! Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700th century
 pichley 650,000 varshon ke dauraan kisi bhi samay se in staron ko kaaphi adhik mana ja rahaa he
 This is the period for which the reliable figures are ice cores
 Are derived from
 kam pratyaksh bhuvaigyanik pramaan se yah mana jaataa he ki CO2 kii itani zyada maatra pichhali baar 20 karod varsh pehle hui thi
 Burning of fossil fuels has increased at least one-third of the increase in CO2 from human activities in the last 20 years
 shesh kaary bhoomi ke upyog main parivartan ke kaaran se hota he visheshkar wanon kii kataai se aisa hota he
 Current vaso-atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are approximately 385 per million ppm) by volume

 There are sufficient reserves of fossil fuels to reach this level and to continue emissions even after 2100 if coal, sand sand or methane claretrate are widely used
 jalwaayu par baadhk ghatakon ke prabhaav vibhinn prakriyaaon dwaara jatil ho jate hai
 One of the most obvious responses relates to water evaporation
 carbon daai oxide jaisi dirghakaalin greenhouse prabhaav vaali gaison ke milane se paidaa hone vaali garmi vayumandal main jal ke adhik maatra main vashpikaran kaa kaaran banataa he
 Because water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, it makes the atmosphere even hotter and it changes more water vapor into B) and this reaction continues until the recycling cycle is stopped
 Its effect from oxide will be huge
 yadhyapi pratyuttar kii yah prakriya vaayu kii nami ke kanon main badhotari karti he, tab bhi saapeksh ardrata yaa to sthir rahati he yaa thodi si ghat jaati he kyonki vaayu garm ho jaati he
 This effect of response can only be reversed slowly as carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifespan
 badalon se prabhavit hone vaale pratyuttar ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Seen from below, the cloud emits infrared radiation back to the surface and exerts a heat effect, seen from above, the clouds and sunlight emit space to reflect infrared radiation and therefore exert a cooling effect
 shuddh prabhaav kya garm athwa thanda he yah badal kii kism or unchai jaise vivaranon par nirbhar karata he
 These descriptions on climate models are difficult to demonstrate because clouds are much smaller than the points between spaces on computer mines of climate models
 jaise jaise vayumandal garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise paramarshi pratyuttar kii prakriya chook dar main parivartan se sambandhit hoti he
 As the temperature in the troposphere increases, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases
 avarakt vikiran kaa utsarjan taapmaana kii chauthi shakti par nirbhar karata he, vaataavaran kii upari tah se zyada lambi vikiran utsarjit hoti he or nichali tah se yah kam hoti he
 Most of the radiation that is emitted from the upper atmosphere goes into the hole, while the radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere is again absorbed by the atmosphere
 is prakaar, green house prabhaav vaataavaran main taapmaana ke oonchai ke saath kam hone kii raftaar pe nirbhar karata he, agar taapmaana kii dar kam he to green house asar zyada hoga or agar taapmaana girane kii dar kam he to green house asar kam hoga
 Both the theory and the model indicate that warming will reduce the temperature drop with altitude, creating a negative lapse rate feedback and weakening the greenhouse effect
 oonchai ke saath taapmaana parivartan kii dar kaa maapan choti-choti trutiyon ke prati bahut savendenshil hota he, isse yah pataa karnaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he ki model hakeekat se mail khaataa he ke nahin 
 Another important process is the ice 'albedo response when the global temperature increases, then the ice near the poles starts melting at a faster rate
 jaise jaise barf pighalati he vaise vaise bhoomi athwa khulaa jal uskaa sthsthaan le letaa he
 Both land and water are less reflective than ice and therefore absorb more amount of solar radiation
 isse adhik garmi ho jaati he jiske kaaran or adhik barf pighalane lagati he tathaa yah chakra chalata rahata he
 Positive reorientation that occurs due to the emission of CO2 and CH4 is another reason that increases warming
 yah gaisen jamate hue permphrost jaise kii jamaa hui lakdi, siberia main daldal se paidaa hoti hai
 Likewise, methane clathrate, which is found in the oceans, emits enormous amounts of CH4, can be a major cause of warming, as the clathrate gun hypothesis states
 jaise jaise samudr garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise carbon ko alag karne kii kshamta ghatati jaati he
 This is because the declining levels of nutrients in the mesopelagic region are impeding the development of diatoms and favor small phytoplankton that are biological pumps of carbon
 pichley 30 varshon se Some papers suggest that the Sun's contribution has been underestimated
 Duke University ke do shodhakartaaon, Bruce West or Nicola Scafetta ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki surya ne 1900-2000 tak shaayad 45-50 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaane main yogadan diya he or 1980 or 2000 ke bich main lagbhag 25-35 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaaya he
 Climate models have been found by Peter Scott and other researchers to overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases and do not give much importance to solar forcing, suggesting that volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols are also underestimated
 Despite solar forcing, much of the warming is likely to be caused by greenhouse gases, especially from the mid-20th century

 It has also been suggested that the magnetic activity in the Sun also triggers cosmic rays which affect the condensation nuclei of clouds and also affect the climate
 surya kii gatividhi kaa ek asar yah bhi hoga kii isse stretosphior garm ho jaayegi, jabaki green house gas siddhant vahaan par shitalan kii bhavishyavaanee karata he

 stratosferick ozon kii katautee ke kaaran sheetaltaa bhi paidaa hoti he, par ozon riktikaran 1970 ke dashak ke ant tak nahin hua
 Due to solar variation and volcanic activity, from the industrial age to the 1950s, the heat did not increase but only cooling

 a research by Mike Loquood and Klaus Frohlich found that since 1985, there is no correlation between global warming and solar radiation, whether it is solar energy or cosmic rays

 According to the instrumental temperature record, the temperature of the Earth, whether on land or at sea, has increased from 1860–1900
 This increase in temperature is not affected by the urban heat island effect
 From 1079, the temperature of the land is almost double than the sea temperature
 The temperature in the lower troposphere is between 0
12 and 0
22 ° c per decade, as satellite data suggests
 It is believed that temperatures have remained relatively stable for the last one or two thousand years before 1850, with some regional fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period or the short icy era samudr main taapmaana zamin ke mukaable dhire badate hai kyunki mahasaagaron kii adhik heat capcity adhik hoti he or ve vashpikaran se jiada garmi kho sakate hanutari golardh main zamin jiada he isliye vah dakshini golardh kii tulana main jaldi garm hota he utari golardh main mausami barf or samudri barf ke vyapak ilaake hai jo kii ice-albedo feedback par nirbhar karte hai utari golardh main dakshini golardh ke mukaable adhik green house gaisen utsarjit kii jaati hai, par yah garmi main antar ke liye jimmedaar nahin he kyunki pramukh green house gaisen kaafii samay tak rahati hai or donon golardho main acchhee tarah ghul-mil jaati hai Based on estimates from nasa's Institute for Space Studies, 2005 was the hottest year, since the instrument of measurement became available in the late 1800s, breaking the 1998 record by a few hundredths of a degree from the World Meteorological Organization and Climate Research Unit The estimates drawn by 2005 concluded that 2005 was the second hottest year after 1998, as the temperature was unusually high in 1998 because that year El Niño's southern oscillations occurred Anthropogenic utsarjan ke anya pradooshak -visheshkar sulphate arosol sa-thanda karne vaala prabhaav daalate hai kyunki yah aati hui surya kii raushnee ko pratibimbit kar dete hai yah ek aanshik kaaran he us shitalan kaa jo beesvi sadi ke madhya main paaya gaya haalanki prakritik parivartanshiltaa ke kaaran bhi thandapan ho saktaa he
 James Hansen and his colleagues have proposed that the substances emitted from burning fossil fuels —CO2 and aerosols — have eliminated each other's effect, so the heat is mostly due to non-co2 greenhouse gases

 Ubaidullah proceeded to Kabul to establish contact with the Amir of Afghanistan while Mahmud al Hasan proceeded to Hijaz to establish contact with the Turkish Governor, Galib Pasha
 At Kabul, Ubaid Ullah decided that the pan-islamic cause would be best served by focussing on the Indian Freedom Movement
 Ubaidullah proposed that the Afghan Amir declare war against Britain
 Members of the Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal are known to have been active amongst Muslim troops along with Ghadarite agents in South Asia
 Attempts made by the Deobandis of Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal, to organize incursions from the western border of India from Persia, through Baluchistan, to Punjab
 Indian prisoners of war from France, Turkey, Germany, and Mesopotamia — especially Basra, Bushehr, and Kut al Amara — were recruited, raising the Indian Volunteer Corps that fought with Turkish forces in a number of fronts
 The Indians were led by Amba Prasad Sufi, who during the war were joined by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry
 These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans
 The Aga Khan's brother was killed while fighting the rebels
 The rebels successfully harassed British Forces in Sistan in Afghanistan, confining British forces to Karamshir in Baluchistan, and later moving towards Karachi
 Some reports indicating they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar
 The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites
 It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and Baghdad was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged
 They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz

 Meanwhile, the Germans sent a diplomatic mission to attempt to rally the Afghan Amir to the Central war effort
 The mission was headed by Oskar von Niedermayer and included Werner Otto von Hentig, the German diplomatic representative to Kabul, as well as Barkatullah and other prominent nationalists from the Berlin Committee
 Officially headed by Raja Mahendra Pratap, the mission also had representatives the Ottoman Empire, including Kasim Bey 
 The mission established contacts with the tribes of the indo-iranian border and encouraged them to strike against British interests
 This mission was met by Ubaidullah Sindhi's group at Kabul in December 1915
 Along with bringing members of the Indian movement right to India's border, it also brought messages from the Kaiser, Enver Pasha and the displaced Khedive of Egypt, Abbas Hilmi, expressing support for Pratap's mission and inviting the Amir to move against India
 The immediate aim was to rally the Amir against British India and to obtain from the Afghan government a right of free passage
 Although the Amir refused to commit for or against the German proposals at the time, it found support amongst the Amir's immediate and close political and religious advisory group, including his brother Nasrullah Khan, his sons Inayatullah Khan and Amanullah Khan, as well as religious leaders and tribesmen
 It also found support in one of Afghanistan's most influential newspapers, the Siraj al-akhbar, whose editor Mahmud Tarzi took Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916
 Tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap, as well as increasingly anti-british and pro-central articles and propaganda
 By May 1916, the tone in the paper was deemed serious enough for the Raj to intercept the copies to India
 By the end of 1916, hopes of the Amir's support were nearly non-existent
 Nonetheless, the Provisional Government of India was formed in Kabul December 1916 to emphasize to the Amir the seriousness of intent and purpose of the Germans and the Indians
 The government had Raja Mahendra Pratap as President, Barkatullah as Prime Minister, Ubaid al Sindhi as the Minister for India, Maulavi Bashir as War Minister, and Champakaran Pillai as Foreign Minister
 The provisional government found support from Enver Pasha, proclaiming Jihad against Britain
 It also attempted to obtain support from Tsarist Russia, Republican China, and Japan and after the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government corresponded with the nascent Soviet government
 In 1918, Mahendra Pratap met Trotsky in Petrograd before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin, urging both to mobilize against British India
 Under pressure from the British, Afghan cooperation was withdrawn and the mission closed down
 However, the mission, and its offers and liaisons at the time, had profound impact on the political and social situation in the country, starting a process of political change that ended with the assassination of Habibullah in 1919 and the transfer of power to Nasrullah and Later Amanullah, precipitating the Third anglo-afghan War that led to Afghan Independence
 By the end of 1917, divisions had begun appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other
 Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation
 The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation in the war in 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly
 Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded
 One of the last events linked to the conspiracy derives from the Irish involvement when, on 28 June 1920, units of the Connaught Rangers mutinied at Jullundur in Punjab
 The anglo-irish War had already begun in Ireland with German support, to which the British government responded with large scale troop deployments
 The most infamous of these were the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Division
 The news of atrocities by these units, upon reaching India, was instrumental in triggering a mutiny in the 1st Battalion of the Connaught Rangers
 Five men from c Company refused to take orders from their officers, declaring their intent not to serve the King until British forces left Ireland
 The Union Flag at Jullundur was replaced by the flag of the Irish Republic
 This mutiny was suppressed within three days and the mutineers imprisoned at Dagshai
 However, rumors of execution of the prisoners led to the spread of unrests
 atsolan, Private James Daly led about 70 Rangers in mutiny and tried to storm the armory, which the loyal guard successfully defended
 Two mutineers were shot dead while others were taken prisoner
 In all, about 400 men joined the mutiny, of whom eighty-eight were court martialled
 Fourteen were sentenced to death and the rest given up to 15 years in gaol
 a few were acquitted
 Thirteen of the men sentenced to die had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment
 21-year-old Daly was shot by a firing squad in Dagshai prison on November 2, 1920; he was the last member of British Forces to be executed for mutiny
 Daly and John Miranda were buried at the Dagshai graveyard

 Outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy began to be noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Incidents like the delhi-lahore Conspiracy and the Komagata Maru incident had already alerted the CID of the existence of a large-scale network and plans for pan-indian militant unrest
 Measures were taken which focussed on Bengal—the seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the time—and on Punjab, which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of Komagata Maru
 Har Dayal's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose, and were "cleaned up" in the wake of the Delhi bomb case
 At the outbreak of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little efforts to hide their plans and objectives
 These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy, as well as discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts
 Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries
 In Punjab, the CID, although aware of possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915
 a dedicated force was formed, headed by the Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan 
 In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of one Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan
 Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment
 Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence
 As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the D-day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day
 No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Khan of the change of plans
 Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to make good his escape under the cover of answering the call of nature
 The role of German or baltic-german double-agents, especially the agent named Oren, was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for Autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 as well as scuttling Bagha Jatin's plans in winter that year
 Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured
 Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war
 Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence
 By the time the war broke out the Indian Political Intelligence Office, headed by John Wallinger, had expanded into Europe
 In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office, approaching the European intelligence network of the Secret Service Bureau
 This network already had agents in Switzerland against possible German intrigues
 After the outbreak of the war Wallinger, under the cover of an officer of the British General Head Quarters, proceeded to France where he operated out of Paris, working with the French Political Police, the Sûreté
 Among Wallinger's recruits in the network was Somerset Maugham, who was recruited in 1915 and used his cover as author to visit Geneva while avoiding Swiss interference
 Among other enterprises, the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe
 a British agent called Donald Gullick was dispatched to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhaya while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet Mahendra Pratap to offer Kaiser Wilhelm ii's invitation
 It is said that Somerset Maugham based a number of his stories on his first-hand experiences, modelling the character of John Ashenden after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath
 The short story of Giulia Lazzari is a blend of Gullick's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and Mata Hari's story
 Winston Churchill reportedly advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories
 The Czech revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of Bagha Jatin's plans
 The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots
 The American network, headed by EV Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats
 Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities
 In the Middle East, British counter-intelligence was directed at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the Kabul Mission
 In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through both Irish as well as Indian channels
 The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by WC Hopkinson, who had grown up in India and spoke fluent Hindi
 Initially WCH had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of Taraknath das
the Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian seditionists on the East Coast as early as 1910
 Francis Cunliffe Owen, The officer heading the Home Office agency in New York, had become thoroughly acquainted with George Freeman alias Fitzgerald and Myron Phelps, the famous New York advocate, as members of the clan-na-gael
 Owens' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS Moraitis plan
 The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans, sensing infiltration, encouraged formation of an entirely Indian society
 Following this, a number of approaches were adopted, including infiltration through a "native" Indian intelligence officer by the name of Bela Singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to British intelligence, as well as the use of the famous American Pinkerton's detective agency
 WC Hopkinson himself was assassinated in a court in Victoria by a Ghadarite called Mewa Singh in October 1914
an Irish double agent by the name of Charles Lamb is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the Annie Larsen and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution
 An Indian operative, codenamed "C" The conspiracy led to a number of trials in India, most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy trial, which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny
 Other trials included the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge
 At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the Defence of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial
 Of these 42 were awarded the death sentence, 114 transported for life, and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment
 a number of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman
 Forty two defendants in the trial were acquitted
 The Lahore trial directly linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot
 Following the conclusion of the trial, diplomatic effort to destroy the Indian revolutionary movement in the United States and to bring its members to trial increased considerably
 In the United States, the Hindu German Conspiracy trial commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on November 12 1917 following the uncovering of the Annie Larsen affair
 One hundred and five people involved, including members of the Ghadar Party, the former German consul-general and vice-consul, and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco
 The trial itself lasted from November 20 1917 to April 24 1918
 The last day of the trial was notable for the sensational assassination of the chief accused, Ram Chandra, by a fellow defendant, Ram Singh, in a packed courtroom
 Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a US Marshal
 In May 1917, eight Indian Nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain
 In later years the proceedings were criticized as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that the United States was joining an Imperialist war
 The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations
 Strong public support in favor of the Indians, especially the revived Anglo-phobic sentiments following the colonial provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the Ghadarite movement to revive despite British concerns
 The conspiracy had a significant impact on Britain's policies, both within the empire and in international relations
 The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Alarmed at the agile organisation, which repeatedly reformed in different parts of the country despite being subdued in others, the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempts at pan-indian revolutions were spreading through India "like some hidden fire"
 a massive, concerted, and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement
 Attempts were made in 1914 to prevent the naturalisation of Tarak Nath Das as an American citizen, while successful pressure was applied to have Har Dayal interned
 The conspiracy, judged by the British Indian Government's own evaluation at the time, and those of a number of contemporary and modern historians, was an important event in the Indian independence movement and was one of the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century
 In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, it was a major factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act of 1915
 Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael o'dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement
 It was also a factor that guided British political concessions as well as Whitehall's India Policy during and after World War I, including the passage of montagu-chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917
 The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to Bolshevik Russia, as well as a still active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sydney Rowlatt, an English judge
 It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal
 On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India act of 1915, was enforced in India

 The events that followed the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy
 At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India
 The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention
 News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India
 The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India
 It was at this time that Gandhi, until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader
 Ominously, in 1919, the third anglo-afghan war began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul mission
 In addition, in India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests
 The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication systems
 The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that "practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000
" In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh
 This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days
 Michael o'dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer
 The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, contrary to being an isolated incident, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy
 James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre
 Lastly, British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderatist movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement
 The conspiracy influenced a number of aspects of Great Britain's international relations, most of all anglo-american relations during the war, as well as, to some extent, anglo-chinese relations
 After the war, it was one of the issues that influenced anglo-japanese relations
 At the start of the war, the American government's refusal to check the Indian seditionist movement was a major concern for the British government
 By 1916, a majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign Office were related to the Indian seditionist movement
 Before the outbreak of the war, the political commitments of the Wilson Government ,, and the political fallouts of the perception of persecution of oppressed people by Britain prevented the then ambassador cecil-spring Rice from pressing the issue diplomatically
 After Robert Lansing replaced Bryan as Secretary of State in 1916, Secretary of State for India Marquess of Crewe and Foreign Secretary Edward Gray forced spring-rice to raise the issue and the evidences obtained in Lahore Conspiracy trial were presented to the American Government in February
 The first investigations were opened in America at this time with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel, resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in the Hindu German conspiracy trial
 However, a perceptibly slow and reluctant American investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916, aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of the British far-eastern fleet on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels
 Seizure of German and Turkish passengers from the American vessel China by the 'HMS Laurentic at the mouth of the Yangtze River, followed by a number of incidents including the SS Henry S, which were defended by the British government on grounds that the seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in India, drew strong responses from the US government, prompting the US Atlantic Fleet to dispatch destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels
 Authorities in the Philippines were more cooperative, which assured Britain of knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong
 The strained relations were relaxed in May 1916 when the Britain released the China prisoners and released its aggressive policy seeking cooperation with the United States
 However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year

 However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year
 The conspiracy issue was ultimately addressed by William G
 E
 Wiseman, head of British intelligence in the United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police bypassing diplomatic channels
 This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty
 As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy
 Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality
 At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its Embassy to cooperate with the investigations resolving the anglo-american diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war
 Through 1915–16, China formed one of the major bases for the conspirators, and significant efforts were made by the British government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues
 This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the Entente powers
 However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war
 This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in southern China laid the foundations for deterioration of anglo-japanese relations as early as 1916
 After the end of the Great War, Japan rapidly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies
 Notable among these were Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, and AM Sahay
 The IIC was formally disbanded in November 1918, with most of its members becoming closely associated with Communism and the Soviet Union
 Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920
 Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of M
N
 Roy, was among the first Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements
 Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927
 He later fled Nazi Germany for Soviet Russia but disappeared in 1937 under Stalin's Great Purge
 The Ghadar Party, suppressed during the war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs
 Although sidelined in California, it remained relatively stronger in East Asia, where it allied itself with the Chinese Communist Party
 Although the conspiracy failed during World War i and the movement was suppressed at the time with a number of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, a number of prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand
 The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s, began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination
 During World War II, a number of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept
 Bose himself, from the very beginning of World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequently escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain
 He would later return to Southeast Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labour of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, and Rash Behari Bose
 The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi hukumat-e-azad Hind in Southeast Asia
 The Ghadar Memorial Hall in San Francisco honors members of the party who were hanged following the Lahore conspiracy trial, and the Ghadar Party Memorial Hall in Jalandhar, Punjab commemorates the Ghadarites who were involved in the conspiracy
 a number of those executed during the conspiracy are today honored in India
 Kartar Singh is honored with a memorial at his birthplace of the village of Sarabha
 The Ayurvedic Medicine College in Ludhiana is also named in his honors
 The Indian government has produced stamps honoring a number of those involved in the conspiracy, including Har Dayal, Bhai Paramanand, and Rash Behari Bose
 a number of other revolutionaries are also honored through India and the Indian American population
 a memorial plaque commemorating the Komagata Maru was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru at Budge Budge in Calcutta in 1954, while a second plaque was unveiled in 1984 at Gateway Pacific, Vancouver by the Canadian government
 The ship itself is today maintained by the Komagata Maru heritage foundation
 In Singapore, two memorial tablets at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall and four plaques in St Andrew's Cathedral commemorate the British soldiers and civilians killed during the Singapore mutiny
in Ireland, a memorial at the Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin commemorates the dead from the Jalandhar mutiny of the Connaught Rangers
 The conspiracy is known under a number of different names, including the Hindu Conspiracy, the indo-german Conspiracy, the Ghadar conspiracy, or the German plot
 The term hindu-german Conspiracy is closely associated with the uncovering of the Annie Larsen plot in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian Nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality
 The trial itself was called the hindu-german Conspiracy trial, and the Conspiracy was reported in the media as hindu-german Conspiracy
 However, the Conspiracy involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs as well, along with strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement
 The term Hindu was used commonly in opprobrium in America to identify Indians regardless of religion
 Likewise, conspiracy was also a negative term
 The term Hindu Conspiracy was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries
 The term Ghadar Conspiracy may also refer more specifically to the mutiny planned for February 1915 in India
 The term German plot may also refer more specifically to the plans for shipping arms to Jatin Mukherjee in Autumn 1915
 The term indo-german conspiracy is also commonly used to refer to later plans in Southeast Asia and to the mission to Kabul which remained the remnant of the conspiracy at the end of the war
 All of these were parts of the larger conspiracy
 Most scholars reviewing the American aspect use the name hindu-german Conspiracy, the hindu-conspiracy or the Ghadar Conspiracy, while most reviewing the conspiracy over its entire span from Southeast Asia through Europe to the United States more often use the term indo-german conspiracy

 The reasons for which the equilibrium, or health, of various parts of the body are destroyed and distortions occur in them, are called causative and their science is called etiology
 ye kaaran anek hai
 They are divided into the following parts: ye hetukikaarak jis prakaar se vikrutiyon ko utpann karte hai, usko rogajanan kehete hai
 The pathologies that occur in various parts of the body due to pathological conditions are known as pathologies and the description of the metal organ or intent with these pathologies is called the pathology and pathology is the pathology
 vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy vividh rogakaarakon se vibhinn ango main jo vividh vikrutiyaan utpann hoti he, unka kaaryakaaran bhav pradarshit karnaa he
 The main purpose of pathology is to give an explanation of the gross and subtle forms of those deformities and to clarify the symptoms arising from various diseases based on them
 yah uddeshy vividh vyaadhiyon se mrit vyaktiyon ke sampurna itihaas ke saath, maranottar pareekshan se unke sharir ke vibhinn dhatvashayadi angon ke bheetar paae janevaali vikrutiyon, kaa mail kiye bina siddh nahin ho saktaa
 Post mortem for pathology was introduced in Western countries in the 16th - 17th centuries
 morgagni ne san 1761 main uske purv kiye gaye saikadon shavpareekshanon kii chaanvin kar, unamem se saat sau shavpareekshanon ke vrittant ko brihad sangrah granth ke teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya
 In this treatise, the extent to which the signs and symptoms found in various organs of patients correlate with the anatomical malformations found within their bodies
 iske pashchaat hi vikrutivigyaan ko swatantra astitv praapt hua
 Rudolph Fikhons began using the microscope in the 19th century to test for physiologic malformations and published his treatise on cellular pathology in 1846 AD
 is granth ne rogon ke swaroop kii tathaa unke abhyas ke liye koun-cone se saadhan prayukt hone chahie or prayukt ho sakate hai, inke sambandh kii kalpana main kranti paidaa kii tathaa vikruti vigyaan ko, jo pehle roganidan ke antargat ek chota sa vishay tha, nidaan kaa ek uttam adhishthan bana diya
 Despite the latent malformations in the body parts, the reaction, swelling, renovation, growth inhibition, degeneration, tumor, etc
 are some common types of Ini-guinea
 sharir ke bheetar in vikrutiyon kaa swaroop jab aasaani se indriya grahya hota he, tab usko sthool vikruti kehete hai tathaa sookshm swaroop kii vikruti hone par in vikrutiyon ko dekhne ke liye jab sookshmdarshi yantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab usko sookshm vikruti kehete hai
 Deformations emphasize the heterogeneity of various body parts and their anatomical and morphological changes and their functional changes in diseases
 saransh main vikrutiyon kaa ullekh vibhinn angon se sambandhit hota he or rog kaa ullekh adhiktar lakshanon se sambandhit hota he
 The disease remains in the form of malformations in the body from long ago
 keval vah bahut sookshm hone se indriyagrahya kam hokar buddhigrahya adhik hota he
 When complete body deformities and their causes are described according to the above general types, then it is called normal pathology and when each organ, intention or institution of the body is described independently of the above types of deformities
 Is, then it is called special pathology
 prayogshaala ke andar vibhinn parikshaon se rogi ke rog kaa adhyayan clinical pathology dwaara kiya jaataa he
 General pathology is divided into the following chapters
 aadhunik vichaarak yah maanate hai ki sujan, sajiv sharirastha koshikaon ke dwaara kisi bhi kshobh ke virodh main kii gai pratikriya maatr he
 There are four reasons for the outbreak: sujan ke pramukh chihn nimnlikhit hai : Along with this, there is a loss of activity of the organ due to some shock in the tissues and due to some colic
 sharir kaa nirmaan karanevaale vibhinn utakon ke ke hraas, vinaash tathaa kshati ko saamaanya oothkakshay kehete hai
 Causes - The following are the major causes of tissue tissue saransh main oothkakshay kaa mukhya kaaran dhamni, shiraaon tathaa keshikaon main avrodh kaa hona he
 Due to this, nutritious substance does not reach the said place
 oothkakshay ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai : It is also a tissue-specific action
 jab kisi utak kaa apakarshan kaha jaataa he, to iskaa abhipraay utak main ek vishesh prakaar kaa parivartan samajhnaa chahie, jaise vasa apakarshan kehane se kisi ootkavishesh main vasa kii upasthiti he, aisa bodh hota he, usee ke anusaar namakaran bhi hota he, jaise hriday apakarshan, mansapeshiy apakarshan, yakruti apakarshan ityadi
 In other words, when there is a change in the chemical activity of the cell due to lack of nutritious diet of tissues, it is called detraction
 isamen koshika kii purnataya mrityu ho jaati he tathaa uske protoplasm se ek nae prakaar ke rasinic padaarth kii utpatti hoti hai
 This substance is completely different from the previous structure of the cell and thus the function of the cell is completely different
 jab koshika ke andar lasika main se ek vishisht padaarth nikalakar ikattha ho jaataa he, to use ant:spandan kehete hai
 This infusion is mainly adipose, calcareous and amyloid type, whereas ablation is fatty mucoid and colloid
 rakt ke abhaav se jab utak main ek prakaar kii sadan hone lagati hai, to use koth kehete hai
 It is of two types dry koth and humid
 shushk koth - jab kisi ek bhaag kii dhamni dwaara kisi ang main rakt pahunchnaa band ho jaataa he, to shushk koth kii utpatti hoti he
 Humid dictionary - In this, the movement of blood from the veins by a particular organ towards the heart stops completely
 rakt kii us sthaan par aamad hoti he, parantu nikaas nahin hota
 Apart from the above two types of coaths, there are other types of coaths as well, such as intercostal coath, infectious coath, pneumothritis, diabetes mellitus, senescent coath, and renal disease
 jeern yaa vinasht hue utak yaa koshikaon kii kriya yathasambhav pun: praapt kii jaae, is abhipraay se jo unka punarjanan hota he, vah punarnirmaan, yaa jirnoddhar kaha jaataa he
 It is such a special state of the body in which there is growth of body tissue
 saamanyat: arbud do prakaar ke hote hai : Soft tumors - These are fatal because they do not cause any harm to life
 ghaatak arbud- jin arbudon main vighatan atyadhik hota he, unamem utak kii si akruti nahin banati
 Their composition is different from that of tissue and their growth is very rapid
 ve sharir main shighratapurvak prasaarit hokar andar hi andar swasth avyavon ko aakraant karte hai
 The action of this internal transmission is called metastasis
 is kaaran ye bahut maarak bhi hote hai or isi se inhen ghaatak, dusht, yaa chand arbud kaha jaataa he
 When there is an attack of any pathogenic bacteria in the human body, then the nature inside the body resists them the most, and in this war, the body's thick cells protect the body from disease by destroying the force of those external bacteria
 sharir ke andar se utpann isi roganashak shakti ko pratiraksha kehete hai
 There are two types of immunity: swaabhaavik pratiraksha - kisi rog ke pratirodh main sharir ke andar jo swaabhaavik shakti utpann hoti he use swaabhaavik pratiraksha kehete hai
 Earned immunity - If a person does not have the resistance to a particular disease and retrospectively by himself or by any other measures, he can be called acquired immunity
 udaahranarth, haija, chechak, motitora, titains ityadi paidaa karanevaale kuch rogaanu aise chote hai jo ek baar sharir main pravesh karne par rog paidaa kar sakate hai, parantu thodi maatra main pravisht karne par rog ke prati pratiraksha shakti utpann karte hai
 The reason for this is that a toxin produces disease in the body due to excessive intake, but the same toxin creates immunity by staying in very small amounts
 bahenta agra prakhand, agra, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 In mathematics, a group is a set of elements with a binary function defined in a way that gives us the third element by the conjugation of any of its two components and that third element satisfies the four restrictions
 in pratibandhon ko abhigruhit kaha jaataa he jo nimna hai: sanvarak, saahcharyata, tatsamakataa or vyutkramaniyata
 The most common example of a group is a set of integers with addition binary operations; An integer is also obtained by adding any two integers
 samooh abhigruhiton kaa amoort sutrikaran, kisi vishisht samooh athwa isaki sankriya ke moort prakritik rup kaa pruthakaran he
 Thus, abstract algebra and beyond have great mathematical significance
 ganit ke bheetar or baahar kai kshetron main samoohon kii sarvyaapeeta ne unhen samakaleen ganit kaa ek kendriya aayojan siddhant bana diya
 The groups share a deep kinship with the notion of homogeneity
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek samarupata samooh ek jyamitiya object kii samarupata visheshtaon ko sankethik shabdon main badalata he: yahaan samooh un parivartanon kaa samooh hai jo vastu ko aparivartit chhod dete hai or yahaan is tarah ke do parivartanon ko ek ke baad ek pradarshan karnaa dwichar sankriya hai
 The concept of agglomeration arose in the 18th century from the study of polynomial equations of Avarist Geloa
 sankhya siddhanth or jyamiti jaise anya kshetron se yogadan ke baad, samooh dharna ko samanyikrut or dridhtaapurvak 1870 ke aasapaas sthapit kiya gaya tha

 saanchaa:sidebar subsection a familiar group, a set of integers z in which numbers nimnlikhit gun neeche die gaye paribhaasha main die gaye samooh ke abhigruhiton ke liye ek purnank ke rup main kaary karte hai
 The integers, together with Operation +, form an object belonging to a broader class that shares the same structural aspects

 a group does not have to be a permutation

 2555 years before Buddhist philosophy and Spitias, a prince would never have imagined that the path adopted by him would one day be discussed not only in the country but in the whole universe
 us yuvak ne alag raste par chalane kii thaanee
 His aim was to spread Satyah, non-violence, mercy and love away from worldly fetters
 aage chalakar yahi ek yug bana isi yug kaa naam he buddhizam
 In simple words, whoever follows the three jewels of Buddha with full devotion, body, mind and wealth, protect it and carry it forward is the wisdom
 buddhizam kaa mukhya kendra bharat rahaa he
 It is from here that Budhism started, this is the holy land where Prince Siddhartha was born and home of King Shuddhodhana and Queen Mahamaya
 rajkumaar siddharth jo aage chalakar buddha kehalaae, boddha dharm kaa prachaar kiya jiskaa mukhya lakshya prem, ahimsa, tyaag or arhat tha
 One thing worth noting in Buddhism is that the Tathagata Buddha did not preach to each person to convert to Buddhism, nor did he express his desire or attempt
 sabhi kuch praaniyon kii apni buddhi or ichha par chhodkar, maarg deshna di
 This was the compassionate teachings of Buddha
 buddhizam ne shiksha ke prasar main bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii
 Today's university format is derived from intelligence

 Female education also started during the Buddha era, and despite the fierce opposition of the people, Prajapati Gautami was introduced and by joining them in the Sangh showed a new way of education for all women
 buddha ne pashu bali or murti puja kaa khandan kiya or sadmarg par chalane kii deshna di
 The three base texts of Buddhism are Lr Sutra Pitaka, Vinay Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka

 Buddhism is the one that molds itself over time and maintains harmony in modernity and tradition
 buddha dharm kii chaar sangoshtiyaan huin, chauthi sangoshtee raja kanishka ke kaal main kashmir main vasumitra kii upaadhyakshata main 72 i0 main hui
 In this, Buddhism was divided into two sects, one Hinayana and the other Mahayana

 As a Spiti resident myself, i understand my duty to present my thoughts about wisdom in the present situation in front of you today
 khaskar aise sthal ke bare main jise himachal main buddhist kaa garh kaha jaataa he
 It is true that the Spiti are Buddhist and there are direct evidences of Gompa, Mandag, Chharaten and it is also true that Spiti is very much in the matter of faith, but somewhere i see a leak in it
 samay rahete is par dhyaan na diya gaya to yah aane vaale samay main sthiti ko ore gambheer bana saktaa he
 The age-old rich tradition under which the residents here used to carry the traditional knowledge received from their ancestors to the coming generations, this tradition has become very fragmented at present
 jiske kaaran vartmaan yuva peedi apni samrudh, dharmik, saanskrithik tathaa saamaajik paramparaon se dinon din dur hoti ja rahi he
 Unfortunately, in times to come, such a situation can never be denied, when the new generation here gets to hear their past only in folk tales
 is prakaar jo sthal kabhi himalay kshetron main ek sampann dharmik sabhyataa ke liye janaa jaataa tha, apane hi logon kii vaicharik udaseenta ke kaaran dhirelrudhire apni pahchaan dhoomil hote paata he
 Secondly i would like to note that nowadays people are paying more attention to globalization
 yah baat sach or jaruri bhi he ki aadhuniktaa ko saath le kar chalanaa he, lekin kahin na kahin jane anjaane main ham apni samskruti or ateet ko bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 It is only by enriching the past that the present building is strengthened, especially the younger sections are paying more attention to this globalization, due to which the past is now getting tarnished and if it continues like this, then the past and the traditions will almost disappear
 is bhayanak paristhiti ke aane se pehle hi hamen iske purnautthan ke bare main sochna hoga jise kai tareekon se kiya ja saktaa haih From this you can think that by reading only the fifth grade, what will the child be able to understand in this infinite ocean of wisdom? off course not! Our government should pay attention to this, our culture is alive in India today, it is due to this wisdom, due to Bhoti language, so they should at least have 10 + 2 in Spiti and Himalayan regions as an optional subject
 Should be taught in ek jaruri baat yah bhi he ki prashasan ko anya bhashaaon kii bhaanti bhoti bhashaa main bhi rojgaar unmukhi kaarykram chalaane chahie taaki logon ko aasaani se rojgaar uplabdh ho sake or saath main vibhinn gudh vishyon ko samajhane or un par vikasaatmak shodh kaaryon ko badhaava mil sake
 This can go a long way in attracting the present young generation towards this
 dosto! dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki vartmaan pariprekshya main buddha dharm ke adhyayan ke liye bharat varsh se hi nahin apitu videshon se bhi janelrimane vidwaan in kshetron main aakar gahan shodh va adhyayan kaary kar rahe hai
 But in spite of this, the indifferent attitude of the people and the scholars towards these subjects at the local level is not only surprising but also disappointing
 atah meraa yuva varg se aahvan he ki vah apane kshetra ko samajhe, samskruti ko samajhe or buddhizam ko samajhe, kyonki hamaare hi zarie hamaari samskruti kaa sanrvadhan or sangrakshan ho saktaa he
 Only on our shoulders will there be significant responsibility for propagation and propagation of our culture

 Poetry is mainly divided into two categories - audio poetry and visual poetry
 shravy kavy ke antargat sahitya kii ve sabhi vidhaayen aati hai jinaki rasanubhuti shravan dwaara hoti he jab ki drishy kavy kaa vaastavik anand mukhyatya netron ke dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he arthath abhinay uskaa vyavartak dharm he
 Bharatamuni has used the word "natya" for visual poetry
 aacharyon ne "natya" ke do rup maane hai - roopak tathaa uparupak
 There have been many strains of these two again
 roopak ke das bhed he; prahasan inhen main se ek he - naatak, prakaran, bhaan, vyayog, samavakaar, dim, ihamoon, ank, vithi, prahasan
 Adequate material is available in Indian poetry on the nature of farce
 bharat muni ne iske do bhed kiye hai - shuddh prahasan or sankeern prahasan
 The distinction of metaphor in which there is a mocking discussion between heroes like Tapas, sannyasis, priests, monks, srotriyas and other persons of low nature is called Prahāsāna
 nikrusht shrenee ke paatro kaa parihaaspurn abhinay sankeern prahasan ke antargat aata he
 Dhananjaya and Sharadatanaya have also sent three of the farce on the same basis - pure, empty, hybrid
 idhar kuch nae lekhakon ne parampara se bhinn charitrapradhan, paristhitipradhan, cathopakathan pradhan or vidooshakpradhan bhedon kaa ullekh kar prahasan kaa naveen vargeekaran prastut kiya he
 The story of farce is often fictional and has a predominance of humor
 uske vividh paatr apni adbhut cheshtaaon dwaara prekshkon kaa manoranjan karte hai
 In the Kathavikas, help is taken from the mouth and discharge treaties and the entrants, destroyers etc
 are not employed
 isaki kathavstu praaia: ek ank main samaapt ho jaati he, kintu shingabhoopal aadi aacharyo ke anusaar isamen apvadswarup do ank bhi hote hai
 Entertainment is the direct purpose of farce; But indirectly, the observer also gets preaching from it
 sanskrit sahitya ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki tatkaaleen samaaj kii samunnat sthiti tathaa adarshavaadi naatakon ke prati vishesh anuraag hone ke kaaran swatantra prahasanon kii rachana bahut kam hui

 The skit is notable

 Similar to Prahāsa, the nature of comedy has been discussed in Western poetry
 greek acharya plato ne apane adarshavaadi drushtikon ke kaaran kamedi main varnit hansee majaak kaa tiraskaar kiya he
 However, according to Aristotle, the theme of comedy is any physical or character or character distortion that is afflictive or public; Hence, comedy is a recognized form of poetry because of its ability to generalize
 kaant aadi darshanikon ne virodh, asangati, kurupata, buraai, apratyaashit varnan, buddhivilas aadi ko kamedi ke liye aavashyak mana he
 Several distinctions of comedy have been envisaged in the West on the basis of subject and observational influence, of which the form of "fars" is somewhat near to farce

 There are many ideologies about the nature of Parabrahma in India
 jisamen dwait, advait yaa keoladvait, vishishtadvait, shuddhadvait, dwaitadvait jaisi kai saidhantik vichaardhaaraein hai
 The Acharya described the form in which Brahma came to know
 itani vichaardhaaraein hone par bhi sabhi yah maanate he ki bhagwaan hi is sristi kaa niyantaa he
 The founder of the Advaita ideology is Shankaracharya, also known as Shankaradvaita or Kevaladvaita
 shankaracharya maanate hain ki sansar main brahm hi satya he
 Everything else is false
 jeev keval agyaan ke kaaran hi brahm ko nahin jaan paata jabaki brahm to uske hi andar virajman he
 He has stated Advaita principle in his Brahmasutra by saying "ego Brahmasmi"
 vallabhacharya apane shuddhadvait darshan main brahm, jeev or jagat, teenon ko satya maanate hai, jise vedon, upanishdon, brahmasutra, gita tathaa shrimadbhagwat dwaara unhone siddh kiya he

 The Rigveda's Ritcha number mentions three stages of Vishnu
 According to Sakapuni, Visnu placed his steps in a 3-fold manner, on the earth in the atmosphere and in the sky as the sun
 Visnu is chiefly extolled for his three strides with which he traversed the world
 The Mahabharata speaks of him as the presiding deity of motion
 The Natyashastra of Bharata applies to him the epithet amitagata, one with unrestrained movement and the earth is often described as having been trodden by Visnu in the past
 In the epic-vishnu Purana period a few holy spots were supposed to bear the markings of the feet of Visnu, whose main attribute is his power of striding
 Scholar BM Baru explains Visnupada as an astronomical term, when the sun is on the rising point and setting 
 Stories about a hill bearing the footprints of Visnu were current in the days of Yaska
 Visnusmriti mentions Visnupada alongwith Godavari, Gomati, Vipasa etc
 besides Gaya
 An important aspect of Gaya pilgrimage, is visit to Visnupada temple 
 This temple existed in 4th Century AD, but the temple in its present condition belongs to Gupta period
 However, Buchanan draws our attention to an inscription that says the temple was constructed by King Jayasimha of Kashmir in honour of the footprints of deity Dattatreya 
 The epics refer to a Visnupada located in the north
 Mahabharat a carries as many as six references to it, three of which speak of it as a spot on the top of a northern hill
 Historian Suvira Jaiswal says, "at present we cannot determine its exact location, it appears to have been in the north"
 Popularity of worship of Visnupada in Kashmir is certainly due to sway of Buddhism in the region
 Jaiswal argues,” the practice of dedicating the footprints of Visnu and of erecting shrines over them became popular certainly due to the Buddhist influence
 It was later adopted by Vaisnavism in which Visnu’s foot was already much exalted
 But it was not popular among Vaisnavas, as dearth of available evidence indicates”

 Metabolism is the chemical reactions that occur in living organisms
 ye prakriyaayein jeevon ko badhane or prajnan karne, apni rachana ko banaae rakhane or unke paryaavaran ke prati sajag rahane main madad karti hai
 Metabolism is generally divided into two types

 koshikeey shwasan se urja kaa utpaadan
 upachay urja kaa prayog karke proteinon or nabhikeey amlon jaise koshikaon ke anshon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Chemical reactions of metabolism operate in metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is converted to another chemical in a few steps by a series of enzymes

 anzime koshika ke paryaavaran main parivartanon yaa anya koshikaon se praapt sanketon ke anusaar chayapachayee margon ke niyantran main bhi sahaayta karte hai
 The metabolism of an organism determines which substance will be nutritious for it and which is toxic
