 us roj bhor main unke pita paigambar baksh raaj darbar main shehanai bajaane ke liye ghar se nikalne kii taiyaari hi kar rahe the ki unke kaanon main ek bachche kii kilkaariyaan sunai padi
 The word Bismillah sprang out of his mouth with a spontaneous pleasant feeling
 unhone allaah ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya
 However his name was Gajhh Pan's name was Kamaruddin
 lekin vah bismillah ke naam se jane gaye jiskaa shabdic arth he, shri ganesh
 He was the second child of his parents
 unke khandaan ke log darvari raag bajaane main maahir the jo bihar kii bhojpur riyasat main apane sangeet kaa hunar dikhaane ke liye aksar jaaya karte the
 His father used to play the clarinet in the court of Maharaja Keshav Prasad Singh of the princely state of Dumraon, Bihar

 His master uncle 'vilayati' used to perform the clarinet in the Vishwanath temple permanently
 ustad kaa nikaah 16 saal kii umr main muggan kanam ke saath hua jo unke maamu sadik ali kii duusari beti thi
 They gave him 9 children
 ve hameshaa ek behatar pati sabit hue
 He loved his wife very much
 lekin shehanai ko bhi apni duusari begum kehete the
 There was a family of 66 people whom he nurtured and also called his house many times Bismillah Hotel
 lagaataar 30-35 saalo tak sadhana, chah ghante kaa roj riyaj unki dincharya main shaamil tha
 After the death of Alibakhsh Mamu, Khan Saheb single-handedly carried this instrument to the heights of 60 years
 yadhyapi bismilla khan shiya musalmaan the phir bhi ve anya hindustani sangeetkaaron kii bhanti dharmik reeti rivaajon ke prabal pakshdhar the 
 Bismillah Khan of the city of Baba Vishwanath was religious in a strange but exemplary sense
 ve kaashi ke baba vishwanath mandir main jaakar to shehanai bajaate hi the iske alaava ve ganga kinare baithkar ghanton riyaj bhi kiya karte the
 He was a five-time Namaji, always used to participate in festivals, but fasted during Ramadan
 banaras chhodie ke khyaal se hi is kaaran vyathit hote the ki gangaji or kaashi vishwanath se dur nahin rah sakate the
 They did not believe in caste
 unke liye sangeet hi unka dharm tha
 They were truly strong symbols of our common culture

 yah train lokmaanya tilak terminus railway stesan se 12:15AM baje chhootati he or madurai jankshan railway stesan par 11:50AM baje pahunchati he
 Its travel duration is 35 hours 35 minutes
 aspasht tark ek prakaar kaa bahu-maan tark he jisamen charon ke satyaman 0 or 1 ke bich main kuch bhi ho sakate hai 
 Its use is consistent with the concept of 'partial truth' because often we find in life that an argument is neither completely 'true' nor completely 'untrue'
 iske vipareet booleey tark main charon ke maan yaa to 0 hote hai yaa 1
 Digital circuits operate only on boolean logic
 'faji logic' shabdasmooh kaa upyog sabase pehle 1965 main lotphi jaadeh ne aspasht samucchy-siddhanth ke pratipaadan ke saath kiya tha
 But the study of ambiguous logic was going on since the 1920s, which was called infinite-value logic
 aspasht tark kaa upyog bahut se kshetron main kushaltapurvak kiya jaataa he jisamen kuch pramukh kshetra hai- niyantran siddhanth, kritrim buddhi aadi
 Both the degrees of truth and probabilities range between 0 and 1 and so they may initially look similar
 haalanki, vaicharik rup se ve alag hote hai; truth, aspasht rup se paribhaashit set main membership kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo probability theori kii tarah kisi event yaa condishan ke liklihud nahin hota he
 For example, take a glass of 100 ml containing 30 ml of water
 tab ham do avadharanaon par vichaar kar sakate hai: empti or phul 
 The meaning of each of these can be represented by a fixed fuzzy set
 uske baad hi koi is gilaas ko 0
7 khaali or 0
3 bhare hue gilaas ke rup main paribhaashit kar saktaa he
 Note that the concept of emptiness will be subjective and will thus depend on the observer or designer
 doosraa diziner bhi baraabar-baraabar acchhee tarah se ek set membership kaary kaa dizin karegaa jahaan gilaas ko 50 ml se kam ke sabhi vailus ke liye bharaa hua mana jayega
 yah samajhnaa bahut jaruri he ki fazi logic, truth digriyon ko veganes phenomenon ke ek ganitiya model ke rup main prayog karata he jabaki probability, randmaness kaa ek ganitiya model he
 a probabilistic setting would first define a scalar variable for the glass to be full and then define conditional distributions describing the probability that someone would call the glass full, indicating a specific level of completeness
 However, this model has no meaning without acknowledging the occurrence of some event, for example, after a few minutes, the glass will be half empty
 Note that conditioning can be achieved by placing a specific observer that randomly selects a distribution of levels and deterministic observers, or both, for the glass
 parinamswaroop, probability main saadharantah fazines ke sivaa kuch nahin he, ye to maatr alag-alag avadharanaen hai jo baahar se ek jaisi lagati hai kyonki inamen vaastavik sankhyaon ke ek jaise interval kaa prayog hota he
 De Morgan's theorem has dual applicability and properties of irregular variables
 phir bhi, chunki aise prameya binary logic stats ke gunon ke anuroop hote hai, isliye vyakti yah dekh saktaa he ki kahaan par bhram paidaa ho saktaa he
 a basic application can reflect sub-ranges of a continuous variable
 udhaaharan ke liye, anti-lock brake ke taapmaana ke maapan main vishesh taapmaana kii shreniyon ko paribhaashit karne vaale kai alag membership vaale functions kaa samavesh ho saktaa he jo brakes ko acchhee tarah se niyantrit karne ke liye aavashyak hote hai
 Each function represents the same temperature value of a truth value that ranges from 0 to 1
 in truth vailus ko tab brakes ko niyantrit karne ke tareeqon ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 In this image, the meanings of cold, warm, and hot expressions are depicted through functions mapping of a temperature scale
 us scale par ke ek bindu main teen "truth vailus" hai — teen functions main se prayek ke liye ek-ek vailu
 image kii khadi rekha ek vishesh taapmaana ko teen tir gez ke madhyam se darshaati he
 Since the red arrow indicates zero, this temperature can be considered "not hot"
 naarangi rang kaa tir ise "slitli warm" or nila tir ise "feireli cold" ke rup main varnit kar saktaa he
 While variables in mathematics commonly assume numerical values, in applications of fuzzy logic, non-numeric linguistic variables are often used to facilitate the expression of rules and facts
 ek bhashaai veriable jaise ki age, main yang yaa yuva athwa iske vipareet old yaa vruddh jaisaa ek vailu shaamil ho saktaa he
 However, the greatest applicability of linguistic variables is that it can be modified through linguistic hedges applied to elementary terms
 bhashaai hejej kuch kaaryon ke saath sambhddha ho sakate hai
 For example, LA Zadeh suggested taking the membership work class
 haalanki, yah model acchhee tarah se kaam nahin karata he
 See the reference for more information
 fazi set theori, fazi sets par fazi prachaalkon ko paribhaashit karata he
 The only problem with its application is that the appropriate fuzzy operator may not be known
 isi karanvash, fazi logic aam taur par IF-THEN niyamon kaa prayog karata he yaa uski sanrachana karata he, jaise - fazi assocative metrices
 The rules are generally expressed as follows: IF variable IS property THEN action udhaaharan ke liye, ek saadhaaran taapmaana niamak jo ek pankhe kaa prayog karata he, use is prakaar dekh sakate hai: If the temperature is too cold then stop the fan
 If the temperature is cold then slow down the fan
 If the temperature is normal then maintain this level
 If the temperature is hot then increase the fan speed isamen koi "ELSE" nahin he - sabhi niyamon kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he kyonki taapmaana ek hi samay par alag-alag digriyon main "cold" or "normal" ho sakate hai
 The AND, OR and NOT operators of Boolean logic are present in fuzzy logic, which are usually defined as minimum, maximum, and complement; They are called zadeh operators when they are defined in this way
 isliye fazi veriables x or y ke liye: NOT x =) x AND y = minimum, truth) x OR y = maximum, truth) anya prachaalak bhi hai jo swabhaavatah bhashaai hote hai unhen hejez kehete hai or unka bhi anuprayog kiya ja saktaa he
 These are usually adverbs, such as "vari" or "sum", which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula
 anuprayog main, programing language prolog ko iske facilitis ke saath fazi logic ko karyanvit karne ke liye acchhee tarah se gear kiya jaataa he taaki "niyamon" ke ek database ko sthapit kiya ja sake jo logic ko ghataane ke liye puche jate hai
 Such programming is known as logic programming

 In mathematical logic, "fuzzy logic" has many formal systems; Most of them belong to the so-called t-norm Fuzzy Logics
 sabase mahatvapurn proposishnal fazi logics hai: They extend this by adding universal and existential quantifiers to the above-mentioned fuzzy logic in the same way that propositional logic is constructed from propositional logic
 tii-norm fazi logics main universal quantifier ke cimentics, quantiphoid up-sutara ke udaahranon ke truth digriyon ke infimum hote hai
 These logics, also known as fuzzy type theory, extend predicate fuzzy logics to be able to quantify predicates and higher-order objects as well

 The word pauses is derived from Vi + rm + h and its root meaning is "pause", "rest" etc
 jin sarvasammat chinhon dwaara, arth kii spashtataa ke liye vaakya ko bhinn bhinn bhaagon main baantate hai, vyakaran yaa rachanashastra main unhen "viraam" kehete hai
 The exact English synonym of "break" is "stop", but in use the word "punctuation" is found in this sense
 "panktuation" kaa sambandh latin shabd shabd se he, jiskaa arth "bindu" he
 Thus the true meaning of "punctuation" is "to point" or "to place a point in a sentence"
 praaia: log samajhate hai ki "viraam" shabd kaa is arth main prayog aadhunik he or yah shabd panktuation" kaa anuwaad he
 But essentially this is not the case
 panini se bhi bahut purv praatishakhyon evam shikshagranthon main viraam shabd kaa prayog isse milte julate arthon main miltaa he
 There are four types of breaks in Taittariya Pratyakshaya: arthath rugviram, padviram, vivritiviraam, samaanpadavivrittiviraam, in viraamon kii matraayen kramash: teen, do, ek tathaa ardh maani gai hai
 These include the end of the Rigviram phase or verses, ie the complete stop today
 "rik" kaa arth he chand, isiilie is viraam ko "rugviram" kaha gaya he
 It has often been a tradition to give one or two standing pies
 kabhi kabhi chota vriksh yaa phool bhi banaate rahe hai
 "pause" is the middle of two words or terms
 padon ke bich main aata he
 Being in the middle of the posts, it is named "padmaram"
 vastut: padon ke bich koi viraamchihn diya nahin jaataa
 It only means that in normal language there is a pause or lack of sound between the words and it should be about two volumes
 teesraa viraam "vivritiviraam" bhi shabdon yaa padon ke bich main hi aata he, kintu ye vishesh prakaar ke shabd yaa pad hote hai
 Sometimes in Sanskrit it happens that the vowel comes at the end of the word and the vowel at the beginning of the word after it
 saamanyat: aisi sthiti main sandhi ho jaati he
 But when there is no pact between them, the pause between these two words is only half the amount of pause between other common words or pauses
 yahi "vivritiviraam" he
 The breaks between "hari Etau," "ego Isha:" belong to this class
 "vivruti", swaron kii asandhi vivruti: swaryorasandhi: - taittiriya praatishakhth) kaa paribhaashik naam he
 On this basis, this break has been designated by this name
 vivruti viraam ke chaar upbhed bhi kiye gaye hai : These distinctions are found in Manduki, Naradaiya and Yajnavalkya education etc
 upar kaha ja chukaa he ki vivritiviraam ek maatra kaa hota he, kintu iske chaaron bhedon kii maatra samaan nahin he
 Of these, the quantity of the first two is one, but 3 / 4 of the third and 1 / 4 of the fourth
 aashcharya hota he bhartiya manishiyon ke is sookshm adhyayan ko dekhakar
 If the vowels come in the same way, then the break period is really something like this
 pehla viraam charnant yaa chhandant kaa tha, duusare or tisare do padon ke bich ke the
 The fourth stop is within the word or verse
 kabhi kabhi aisa hota he ki shabd main do swar paas paas aate hai, kintu unki sandhi nahin hoti
 Just as the vowel between two terms is named "vivruti", similarly, the name of the vowel in the two vowels in the same verse is identical
 aise swaron ke bich ke viraam ko samaanpadavivruti viraam kaha gaya he
 Such a situation was rare in Sanskrit, but still some examples are found, such as Pragam, Titad
 panini main bhi "viraam" shabd aata he
 Here also the meaning of pause is almost the same ie "silence" or lack of sound
 kashikaakaar kahata he "virativinram:" viramyate anen iti vaa viraam:
 Kashikara has also considered beyond the above mentioned breaks
 unka kahana he ki shabd kii har do dhvaniyon ke bich thodaa sa viraam hota he arthath har do vyanjanon yaa swarvyanjan ke bich
 They consider it equal to half the quantity
 aadhi maatra aaj kii drushti se udasin swar yaa hraswardh swar ke baraabar maani ja sakati he

 Gradually this led to the development of the present signs

 In Europe, regular use of the ceasefire starts from the 16th century
 aarambh main iskaa virodh bhi bahut hua
 The Anunzio used to call himself the enemy of "cama"
 bartoli ne yah kehete hue virodh kiya tha ki mudrit pustakon main viraam chihn patingon kii tarah hai jo pathak ko bahut khatkate hai
 But despite such protests, the use of punctuation has increased due to its utility and now they have become an essential part of writing and printing
 hindi main khadi pai yaa purna viraam bhartiya parampara kaa he, jiskaa pracheen naam "dand" tha
 The remaining symbols came from Europe through English

 Putting a pen on paper while stopping while writing made the point easy
 is prakaar purna viraam ke rup main angreji aadi kaa bindu sahaj hi purna viraam kaa dyotak ban baitha
 Cama is made up of a pause at the full stop or point below
 prashnvachak yaa aashcharyasoochak chihnon kaa vikaas swatantra rup se hua he
 There are differences regarding its origin
 lagata he prashnvachak chihn latin bhashaa ke prashnaarthi shabd Quaestio kaa sankshipt rup he, jisamen upar tathaa o neeche he
 Similarly, the surprising sign of Latin is the pleasant word Io in which i and o are below
 helichak-3 sangrampur, munger, bihar sthit ek gaanv he

 This condition can be prevented with special measures as soon as microalbuminuria is detected

 karatoya nadi ke kinare sthit is mandir ko hindu dharm ke 51 shaktipeethon main gina jaataa he
