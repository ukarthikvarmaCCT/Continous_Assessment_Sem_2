 Here in the Havan material, a Neelkamal from the place of worship disappeared from the elusive power of Ravana and Ram's resolve began to appear broken
 bhay is baat kaa tha ki devi maan rusht na ho jaaen
 The arrangement of the rare Neelkamal was immediately impossible, then Lord Rama readily remembered that i am called 'kamalanayan Navakancha Lochan', so why not offer an eye to fulfill your resolve and take out an arrow from your shoulder like Lord Ram When the eyes were ready to be removed, the goddess appeared, holding her hand and said - Ram, i am happy and blessed Vijayashree
 vahiin ravan ke chandi paath main yajna kar rahe brahmanon kii seva main brahman balak kaa rup dhar kar hanumanji seva main jute gaye

 puranic kathaon ke anusaar mahisasur ke ekagra dhyaan se baadhya hokar devataaon ne use ajay hone kaa vardaan de diya
 After granting him a boon, the gods worried that he would now misuse his power
 or pratyaashit pratifal swaroop mahisasur ne narak kaa vistaar swarg ke dwaar tak kar diya or uske is krity ko dekh devtaa vismay kii sthiti main aa gaye
 Mahishasura has taken away all the rights of Surya, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Moon, Yama, Varuna and other deities and himself became the master of heaven
 devataaon ko mahisasur ke prakope se prithvi par vicharan karnaa pad rahaa he
 Then, angry with this daring of Mahishasura, the gods created Goddess Durga
 aisa mana jaataa he ki devi durga ke nirmaan main saare devataaon kaa ek samaan bal lagaaya gaya tha
 To destroy Mahishasura, all the gods gave their weapons to the goddess Durga and it is said that with the combined effort of these gods, the goddess Durga became more powerful

 saamanyatya bank 21-52 dinon kii rin avadhi pradaan karte hai
 It depends on the type of credit card and the date of payment
 yadi byaaj dar ke bina rin avadhi rahegi to utana hi zyada dinon tak bina byaaj bhare raashi kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
 The credit limit is the maximum amount spent by a credit card
 yah prayokta kii aay par nirbhar karata he jo ki bank credit card dete samay poochta he
 It is believed that the higher the loan limit, the better
 lekin jab tak credit card prayog nahin karte yah salaah bekaar he
 In addition, high-limit can also be fatal in the event of a card being lost
 kuch varsh purv bank or credit card ke liye graahak seva utani viksit nahin thi
 But customer service is most important nowadays
 isliye behatar rishte vaale bank se credit card lenaa zyada phydemand hoga
 All banks try to attract customers by giving them prize points or cash back
 isliye jo graahak niyamit taur par credit card prayog karte hai unhen is yojana main shaamil hona chahie
 a good credit is the same which is acceptable by the shopkeepers in the country as well as abroad
 adhikansh outlet se sambandhit, chhot kii suvidha or kharidari kii suvidhaon se yukt credit card behad phydemand rahata he
 It should also include freedom from surcharge on petrol pumps and easy facilities to pay bills
 credit card ke prayog ke saath saath hi kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhana bhi aavashyak hota he: Payment History: The user's credit card history is important in setting the credit card limit
 credit card kaa bhugtan der se karnaa yaa overdraft hona liye khatre kii ghanti ho saktaa he
 If the bank realizes that the user is a customer who does not have a good credit record, then he can also reduce the credit card limit
 rin: praayah log bina paryaapt kaaran hi rin lone le lete hai
 This makes a big difference on their credit card history
 bahut adhik rin lenaa ek behatar tarika nahin kaha ja saktaa
 According to financial planners, if a person spends 60 percent of his salary to repay the loan, it means that he is in danger

 Credit History: It is not only necessary for the user that they pay the credit card on time

 aise main yadi upayokta credit card ke rin kaa bhugtan to samay se karte hai, lekin car lone kaa bhugtan samyaanusaar nahin karte hai to yah unke liye nakaaratmak siddh ho saktaa he
 Despite regular repayment of the loan, borrowing also has to be controlled
 upayokta ko chaiye ki ve apni credit report ko jaanchate rahe
 Depositing the balance means that his loan is closed
 is samay ye bhi purah tarah se jaanch lenaa chaiye ki unka rin khaataa aupchaarik rup se band ho gaya
 Also, it should be noted that the credit limit can be reduced if: drishyajivi yaa fanerozoik prithvi ke bhuvaigyanik itihaas main ek eon he, jo aaj se 54
1 karod varsh pehle armbh hua or aaj tak chal rahaa he
 Before this there was an Eoin called Proterozoic
