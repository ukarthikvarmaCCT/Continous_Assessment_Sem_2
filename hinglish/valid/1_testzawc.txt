 koshikeey shwasan se urja kaa utpaadan
 upachay urja kaa prayog karke proteinon or nabhikeey amlon jaise koshikaon ke anshon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Chemical reactions of metabolism operate in metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is converted to another chemical in a few steps by a series of enzymes
 anzime chayapachay ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai, kyonki ve jeevon ko aisi apekshit pratikriyaayein, jinamein urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or jo swatah nahin ghat sakati hai, unhen un swatah hone vaali pratikriyaaon ke saath yugal rup main hone main madad karte hai, jinase urja utpann hoti he
 Since enzymes act as catalysts, they allow these reactions to take place rapidly and reasonably
 anzime koshika ke paryaavaran main parivartanon yaa anya koshikaon se praapt sanketon ke anusaar chayapachayee margon ke niyantran main bhi sahaayta karte hai
 The metabolism of an organism determines which substance will be nutritious for it and which is toxic
 For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide, while this gas is toxic to animals
 chayapachay kii gati, yaa chayapachay dar is baat ko bhi prabhavit karti he ki kisi jeev ko kitne bhojan kii jarurat hogi
 a special feature of metabolism is that even if there are large differences in the species, their basic metabolic pathways and fractions are the same

 ye mahounu atyaavashyak hote hai
 Proteins are made up of amino acids arranged in linear chains and added by peptide bonds
 kai protein chayapachay main rasaynic pratikriyaaon ko utprerit karne vaale anzime hote hai
 The function of other proteins is constructive or procedural, such as the cell forming a claw - the structure to maintain cell shape - forming proteins
 Proteins are also important in cell signaling, immunity, adhesion of cells, active transport across membranes, and the cell cycle

 Carbohydrates are the most commonly found organic molecules and play many roles, such as the accumulation and transport of energy and the creative parts
 The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides, which include galactose, fructose, and most importantly, glucose

 As a precaution, Kapone and his gang members would suddenly arrive at Chicago's train depot to book an entire Pullman sleeper coach on night trains and places like Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, and Little Rock / Hot Springs in Arkansas But with full knowledge of local officials and their connivance, they used to spend entire weeks in suites of luxury hotels with misnames
 1928 main kapon ne florida ke palm island main miami bich ke nikat 14 kamaron kaa ek shandaar ghar karidaa
 The bloody game of 14 February 1929 began nearly five years ago with the murder of Dion o'bannis, the leader of Chicago's North Side gang

 After seeing death so closely, he left the city and handed over the command of his business to Kapon; In September 1926 Kapon himself died dying
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kapon ne hi shatabdi kii sabase kukhyat gangland hatya, 1929 main chicago ke north said main sthit linkan park ilaake ke saint velentine diwas narsanhaar, ke aadesh die the
 However, there is considerable disagreement over details of the murder of seven people and Kapone's role in a garage at 2122 North Clark Street
 is aparaadh ke liye kabhi kisi ke upar koi mukadmaa nahin chalaa
 The massacre was allegedly an attempt by Kapon's gang to retaliate against the North Side gang of Bugs Moran
 kyonki yah gang kaaphi dabang ho gaya tha or isane kapon ke sharaab se laden trakon kaa apharan kiya, giroh dwaara niyantrit unione siciliane ke do adhyakshon kii hatya karwaai tathaa kapon ke ek sheersh padasth vyakti jaik macgarn kii teen baar hatya karwaane kii koshish kii

 Due to the plethora of evidence against him, his lawyer petitioned the deal but the presiding judge warned that he might not accept the prosecution's recommendations for sentencing, so Kapone withdrew his plea to guilty

 It was decided to divide Bengal of India into two parts for the purpose of creating a Muslim majority province
 vibhaajan 16 oktober 1905 se prabhavi hua
 In history it is also known as Bangabhang
 yah angrejon kii "foot daalo - raaj karo" vaali niti kaa hi ek ang tha
 Therefore, in 1908 AD, the 'bang-bhang' movement started in protest against it
 is vibhaajan ke kaaran utpann ucch stareey raajnneetik ashaanti ke kaaran 1911 main dono taraf kii bhartiya janata ke dabaav kii vajah se bengal ke purvi evam pashchimi hisse punah ek ho gaye
 The area of bengal province was 489,500 square kilometers and the population was more than 8 crore
 purvi bengal bhugolic rup se evam kam sanchaar sadhano ke kaaran pashchimi bengal se lagbhag alag-thalag tha
 In 1836, the Upper Provinces were brought under the rule of a Lieutenant Governor and in 1854 the Governor general-in-council was relieved of the direct administration of Bengal
 alag chif-kamishnarship banane ke liye 1874 main assam ko silahat sahit, bengal se alag kar diya gaya or baad main 1898 main lushai hills ko bhi isamen shaamil kar diya gaya
 It was very difficult to manage a large and so populous province like Bengal
 sarvapratham 1903 main bengal ke vibhaajan ke bare main sochaa gaya
 Additional proposals were also made to merge the districts of Chittagang and Dhaka and Mamansingh with Bengal and Assam
 isi prakaar chota nagpur ko bhi kendriya praant se milaayaa janaa tha
 The 19th session of the Congress was also held in Madras in 1903
 usee avasar par uske sabhapati shri lalamohan ghosh ne apane abhibhaashan main sarkaar kii pratikriyaavaadi niti kii aalochana karte hue ek akhil bhartiya manchapar asann vangbhang kii soochna di
 He said that such a conspiracy is going on
 sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par 1904 kii janvari main yah vichaar prakashit kiya or farvari main lord karzan ne bengal ke purvi jilon main vibhaajan par janata kii raay kaa akalan karne ke liye adhikarik daure kiye
 He consulted with prominent personalities and made speeches in Dhaka, Chittagong and Mamansingh to try to explain the government's stand on partition
 henry jon stedman coton, jo ki 1896 se 1902 ke bich assam ke mukhya ayukta the, ne is vichaar kaa virodh kiya
 Speaking from the post of Chairman in the next session of Congress, Sir Henry Cotton also said that if there is an excuse that such a large province cannot be handled by a governor, then either the governing council of Bengal, like Bombay and Madras, will be in the vicinity of the Governor or Bengali
 Speakers should be separated and made a province
 un dinon bengal praant main bihar or urisa bhi shaamil the
 But the British government neither cared for Congress nor did it hold public opinion
 us samay ke vysarai or governor general lard karjan ne land holders association yaa jameendaar sabha main logon ko yah samajhane kii cheshtaa kii ki vangbhang se laabh hi hoga
 He himself went to East Bengal too, but none other than a handful of Muslims supported this proposal
 musalamaanon main pratishthit dhaka ke tatkaaleen nawab ne bhi pratham aavesh main iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Bengal was partitioned in 1905 on 16 October by Lord Curzon, the then Voice Rai of India
 vibhaajan ko prashaskeey kaaryon ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya, bengal lagbhag france jitna bada tha jabaki uski aabaadi france se kahin adhik thi
 It was thought that the eastern region was neglected and not properly governed
 praant ke bantwaare se poorviy kshetra main behatar prashasan sthapit kiya ja saktaa tha jisase antat vahaan kii janata skool or rojgaar ke maukon se labhanvit hoti
 However, other motives were also hidden behind the plan of partition
 bengali hindu, shashan main adhik se adhik bhagidaari ke liye rajnatik andolan main agrani the, atah ab purv main muslimon kaa varchasv badhane se unki sthiti kamjor ho rahi thi| hindu or muslim dono hi ne vibhaajan kaa virodh kiya| vibhaajan ke baad, haalaanki, lagbhag rashtriya str par british virdohi andolan prabal hua jisamen ki ahimsak or hinsak virodh pradarshan, bahishkaar or yahan tak ki pashchim bengal ke nae praant ke rajyapal kii hatya kaa prayaas bhi shaamil tha
 On 20 July 1905 Vangabhang's proposal was struck down by the Secretary of India, despite strong public opposition
 rajshahi, dhaka tathaa chatagaanv kamishnariyon ko assam ke saath milakar ek praant banaaya gaya, jiskaa naam purvavang or assam rakhaa gaya or baaki hissaa yani presidensi or vardhaman kamishnariyaan bihar, ud or iskaa koi aadhaar tha
 On this occasion, Hindus and Muslims were tried to fight, saying that this division would benefit the Muslims as they would have a majority in the East and Assam
 dhaka ke nawab ne pehle virodh kiya tha, par jab vangbhang ho gaya to vah uske paksh main ho gaye
 Sir Joseph Bamfield Fuller became the former and the new Lieutenant Governor of Assam
 kaha jaataa he, unhone kai jagah khullamakhulla kaha ki hindu or musalmaan unki do bibiyaan hai, inamen se musalmaan unki chaheti hai
 The meaning of this statement was clear
 vangbhang kaa uddeshy prashasan kii suvidha utpann karnaa nahin tha, jaisaa daawa kiya gaya tha, balki iske do spasht uddeshy the, ek hindu musalmaan ko ladaana or duusare navjaagrath bengal ko chot pahunchaana
 If seen in depth, it was the seed planting of Pakistan from here
 muslim lig ke 1906 ke adhiveshan main jo prastaav paas hue, unamem se ek yah bhi tha ki vangbhang musalamaanon ke liye acha he or jo log iske viruddh andolan karte hai, ve galat kaam karte hai or ve musalamaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Later, in the 1908 session of the League, it was also passed that the proposal of the Congress to oppose Vangabhang was not worthy of acceptance
 nae praant main pahari rajya tripura, chittagong mandal, dhaka or rajshahi shaamil hue or malda jile ko assam praant main mila diya gaya
 Bengal not only had to leave these large eastern states, but also five Hindi-speaking states had to be lost to the Central province
 pashchim kii taraf se ise madhya praant se sambalpur or paanch chote oriya-bhashi rajya pradaan kiye gaye
 Bengal had an area of 141,580 square miles and a population of five crore forty lakhs, of which four crore twenty lakhs were Hindus and ninety million Muslims
 nae praant kaa naam kramshah purvi bengal or assam tha jisamen purvi bengal kii rajdhani dhaka or assam kaa adhinsth mukhyalay chittagong tha
 Its area was 106,540 square miles and the population was thirty million, of which one crore eight million Muslims and one crore twenty lakh Hindus
 prashasan ke liye vahaan ek vidhaan parishad tathaa ek dwi-sadasyeey rajasav board tha or kalakatta ucch nyaayalay ke adhikaar-kshetra ko badla nahin gaya tha
 The government pointed out that there would be a properly defined western border between East Bengal and Assam and would have well-defined geographical, necrological, linguistic and social features
 bharat sarkaar ne apana antim nirnay 19 july 1905 ke sweekrut prastaav se prachaarit kiya or bengal kaa vibhaajan usee varsh 16 oktober se lagu ho gaya
 Before its abolition in 1911, the division lasted barely half a decade
 haalaanki bantwaare ke peeche britain kii niti divide at impera thi, jo ki punarsangathit praant ko prabhavit karti rahi
 In 1919, separate electoral system was established for Muslims and Hindus
 is se pehle, donon samudaayon ke kai sadasyon ne sabhi bengaaliyon ke liye rashtriya ekta kii vakaalat kii thi
 Now, individual communities developed their own political issues
 muslimon ne bhi apni samgr sankhyatmak shakti ke bal par, jo ki mote taur par do karod bees lakh se do karod assi lakh ke bich thi, vidhanmandal main varchasv hasil kiya
 The demand for the creation of two independent states for Hindus and Muslims at the national level began to arise, with most Bengali Hindus now favoring the partition of Bengal on the basis of Hindu majority area and Muslim majority area
 muslim ab puure praant ko muslim rajya, pakistan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate the
 Bengal split for the second time in 1947, this time on religious grounds
 yah purvi pakistan ban gaya
 However, after a successful liberation war with Western Pakistani military rule in 1971, East Pakistan became an independent state called Bangladesh
 bengal ke donon vibhaajanon main raktapaat hua
 This created a major political crisis
 purvi bengal main muslimon kii dharna thi ki ek alag kshetra unhen shiksha, rojgaar aadi ke adhik avasar uplabdh karaayega, jabaki pashchimi bengal ke logon ko yah bantwaaraa pasand nahin aayaa or is samay ke dauraan badi maatra main rashtravaadi sahitya kii rachana kii gayi
 The protest by the Indian National Congress was led by Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton, formerly the Chief Commissioner of Assam, but Curzon remained unmoved
 baad main coton ne, jo ab purvi naatingham ke udaaravaadi saansad ban gaye the, sar bempfield fuller, jo purvi bengal ke pehle leftinent-governor the, ko nikaalane ke abhiyaan kaa safalataa purvak sanchaalan kiya
 In 1906 Rabindranath Tagore composed Amar Shonar Bangla, the rally slogan of those who opposed partition, became the national anthem of Bangladesh in 1972
 in raajnneetik virodhon ke kaaran, bengal ke donon bhaag 1911 main phir se jud gaye the
 a new partition took place that divided the province on linguistic lines in place of religious, thereby separating the Hindi, Oriya and Assamese speaking areas into new administrative units
 iske saath hi saath british bharat kii prashasnic rajdhani ko kalakatta se nai dilli le jaaya gaya
 However, the conflict between Muslims and Hindus resulted in the creation of new laws to satisfy the political needs of both classes
 bangbhang ke viruddh bengal ke baahar bahut baari andolan hua
 Famous poets and litterateurs played an important role in this movement

 At that time the English cycle of dividing Bengal was broken, it gained extraordinary fame all over the country and abroad

 buddha upaadhyaay ji utsaah se "buddha dharm ke teen bhashaa pariwaron ke samanvay or haan buddha dharm ke saare aath sampradaayon ke prachaar" kaa vakaalat karte hai
 They are trying to build on a set of Han Buddhism learning and practice for a specified time
 un upaadhyaay ji se "acedemic kii tarah abhyaas karne, abhyaas kii tarah acedemic karne, sikhane or vyavhaar ke samanvay, or vigyaan kii tarah prabandh karne" ke buddha dharm par sikhane or vyavhaar kii sthapit par amal main laayaa hua

 unhone kisi baaten kii vakaalat kii he ki buddha dharm ke paramparaagat siddhant ko aadhunik sabhyataa se samanvay karnaa chaiye, buddha dharm ke sheel or mahe guru ke dharmik sheelvinya ko aadhunik prabandh samucchy se samanvay karnaa chaiye, hamen bhikshu or bhakt kii pratibha kaa prashikshan karnaa chaiye, buddha dharm ko samaaj main dubona or is kii naukari karnaa chaiye
 He has also advocated something that we should spread Chinese traditional culture all over the world, with the intention of this that Chinese Buddhism can establish itself and Buddhism can establish socialization and globalization, more people than Buddhism and all the world Can help pramukh vishvavidhyalay, rashtriya mukh or ucch manch ke nimantran se upaadhyaay ji aksar academik or samskruti aadan-pradaan karte hai, is ke iraade se buddha dharm ke thik siddhant or vyavhaar samaaj main dubo or aadmi ko prerit kar sakate hai

 Linguistics is that branch of language study in which scientific and analytical study of the origin, nature, development, etc
 of the language is done
 bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayeta 'bhashavigyaani' kehalaate hai
 Linguistics is different from grammar
 vyakaran main kisi bhashaa kaa kaaryaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he jabaki bhashavigyaani iske aage jaakar bhashaa kaa atyant vyapak adhyayan karata he
 Among the many subjects of study, linguistics is being given special importance nowadays
 bhashaa-sambandhi is adhyayan ko europe main aaj tak anek naamon or sangyaaon se abhihit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Firstly this study was added a word as an adjective next to the word Philology - then it was called as "comparative Philology"
 unnisvin shatabdi tak vyakaran tathaa bhashaa-vishyak adhyayan ko praayah ek hi samajha jaataa tha
 Hence, scholars also named it 'comparative Grammar'
 france main isko langistik naam diya gaya
 The name "linguistique" or "linguistics" has been prevalent in the whole of Europe in the nineteenth century due to the greater language related work in France
 iske atirikt 'science of language', ‘glautoleji’ aadi anya naam bhi is vishay ko prakat karne ke liye kaam main aaye
 Of all these names, "linguistics", "philology" are used only today
 bharatvarsh main in sabhi europea naamon ke atirikt hindi bhashaa main jo naam prayog main laae jate hai ve is prakaar hai- ‘‘bhashaa-shaastra’’, ‘‘bhashaa-tatva’’, ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’, tathaa ‘‘tulanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan’’ aadi
 Among all these names, the most common name is "linguistics"
 in naam main pracheen or naveen sabhi naamon kaa samaahaar-sa hua jaan padataa he
 Therefore, this name seems to be suitable for this scripture
 apane vartmaan swaroop main bhashaa vigyaan pashchimi vidwaanon ke mastishk kii dein kaha jaataa he
 The trend of language-related studies is found in Sanskrit literature since very ancient times
 ‘shiksha’ naamak vedang main bhashaa sambandhi sookshm charchaa uplabdh hoti he
 Detailed description of the pronunciation of the sounds - elements, location, effort etc
 is available in these texts
 ‘praatishakhya’ evam nirukt main shabdon kii vyutpatti, dhaatu, upsarg-pratyay aadi vishyon par vaigyanik vishleshan bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kaha ja saktaa he
 Under Bhartrihari's book 'sentence Pad', subtle, deep and comprehensive thinking of the form of 'word' is available
 vahaan shabd ko ‘brahm’ ke rup main pariklpit kiya gaya he or uski ‘akshar’ sangya bataai gai he
 It is, by default, a language-related book
 sanskrit-sahitya main darshan evam sahityashastreey granthon main bhi hamen ‘shabd’ ’arth’, ‘ras’ ‘bhav’ ke sookshm vivechan ke antargat bhashaa vaigyanik charchaaon ke hi sanket praapt hote hai’ sanskrit-sahitya main yatra-tatra uplabdh hone vaali bhashaa-vichaar-vishyak saamagree hi nishchit rup se vartmaan bhashaa-vigyaan kii aadharshila kahi ja sakati he
 Linguistics as a modern subject is thought to have originated in Europe in 1786 AD by a scholar named Sir William Jones
 sanskrit bhashaa ke adhyayan ke prasang main sar wiliam jones ne hi sarvapratham sanskrit, greek or latin bhashaa kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hue is sambhaavna ko vyakt kiya tha ki sambhawatah in teenon bhashaaon ke mul main koi ek bhashaa rup hi aadhaar bana hua he
 Therefore, there exists a subtle formula between these three languages
 bhashaaon kaa is prakaar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan hi aadhunaki bhashaa-vigyaan ke kshetra kaa pehla kadam bana
 Two terms have been used in the name "linguistics"
 ‘‘bhashaa’’ tathaa ‘‘vigyaan’’
 Before understanding linguistics, it seems necessary to be familiar with both these words
 ‘bhashaa’ shabd sanskrit kii ‘‘bhash’’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Which means - express speech
 ‘vigyaan’ shabd main ‘vi’ upsarg tathaa ‘gya’ dhaatu se ‘lut’ pratyay lagane par banataa he
 In general, 'bhasha' means 'spoken language or dialect' and 'vigyan' means 'special knowledge', but only after understanding the clear and comprehensive meaning of these two terms used in the word 'linguistics'
 We will be able to know the essence of this name
 atah ham yahan in donon padon ke vistrut arth ko spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Language: Human being is a social animal
 samaaj main apane bhaavon or vichaaron ko ek duusare tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa chirkaal se anubhav kii jaati rahi he
 Thus the existence of language proves to be very ancient in human society
 maanav ke sampoorn gyaan-vigyaan kaa prakaashan karne ke liye, sabhyataa or samskruti ke itihaas ko jaanane ke liye bhashaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan kaa kaary karti he
 We have come to know all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences from our ancestors through language
 hamaare sabhi sadgranthon or shastron se milane vaala gyaan bhashaa par hi nirbhar he
 Mahakavi Dandi has written in his great book 'kavyadarsha' informing the importance of language: - arthath yah sampoorn bhuwan andhkarpurn ho jaataa, yadi sansar main shabd-swaroop jyoti arthath bhashaa kaa prakaash na hota
 It is clear that this statement has been said to target human language
 pashu-pakshi bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye jin dhvaniyon kaa aashray lete hai ve unke bhaavon kaa vahan karne ke kaaran unke liye bhashaa ho sakati hai kintu maanav ke liye aspasht hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne use ‘avyakt vaak’ kaha he, jo bhashaa-vigyaan kii drushti se koi mahatva nahin rakhti
 Because in 'avyakta speech' both the words and meanings remain unclear
 manushya bhi kabhi-kabhi apane bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye ang-bhangima, bhru-sanchaalan, haath-paanv-mukhaakriti aadi ke sanketon kaa prayog karte hai parantu vah bhashaa ke rup main hote hue bhi ‘vyakt vaak’ nahin he
 The greatest feature of human language is that it is 'articulated speech', that is, having clarity of words and meanings
 mahabhashya ke rachayita patanjali ke anusaar ‘vyakt vaak’ kaa arth bhashaa ke varnanaatmak hone se hi he
 It is true that sometimes even with the help of signs and disguises, our sentiments and thoughts are transmitted very easily
 is prakaar ve cheshtaayen bhashaa ke pratik ban jaati hai kintu maanav bhaavon ko prakat karne kaa sabase upyukt saadhan vah varnanaatmak bhashaa he jise ‘vyakt vaak’ kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 In this, certain accented or perceived sounds are taken to reveal different meanings
 atah bhashaa ham un shabdon ke samooh ko kehete hai jo vibhinn arthon ke sanketon se sampann hote hai
 By whom we can easily reveal our feelings to others
 is prakaar bhashaa kii paribhaasha karte hue ham use maanav-samaaj main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa aadan-pradaan karne ke liye apanaaya jane vaala ek madhyam kah sakate hai jo maanav ke uccharan avyavon se prayatnpurvak nicksruth kii gai dhvaniyon kaa sarthak aadhaar liye rahata he
 Those phonemes take the form of words when they are attached to a meaning
 sampoorn dhwani-vyapaar arthath shabd-samooh apane arth ke saath ek ‘yadrichhik’ sambandh par aadhaarit hota he
 'random' means completely fictitious
 sankshep main vibhinn arthon main vyakt kiye gaye mukh se uccharit us shabd samooh ko ham bhashaa kehete hai jiske dwaara ham apane bhav or vichaar dusron tak pahunchaate hai
 We have many benefits from the study of linguistics, such as- 1

 in sabhi laabhon kii drushti se aaj ke yug main bhashaa-vigyaan ko ek atyant upyogi vishay mana ja rahaa he or uske adhyayan ke kshetra main nity naveen vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is a natural object that is found as a divine gift to humans
 bhashaa kaa nirmaan manushya ke mukh se swaabhaavik rup main nicksruth dhvaniyon ke dwaara hota he
 The common knowledge of the language becomes available to all who speak and hear it
 yahi bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan kehalaata he
 Next, when did language become, how did it become? What was its initial and ancient form? When and what changes did it happen and what are the reasons for those changes? Or how did the language develop overall? What are the reasons for that development? Which language has so much similarity or dissimilarity with which other language? All this will be called special knowledge of language or 'linguistics'
 isi bhashaa-vigyaan ke vishesh rup arthath bhashaa vigyaan ko aaj adhyayan kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay maan liya gaya he
 When linguistics was included under the syllabus of large classes in the subjects of study, a natural question first arose whether linguistics should be counted under art or in science
 arthath bhashaa-vigyaan kala he athwa vigyaan he
 It was decided to take the process and conclusions of the study that in reality it should be considered as pure science like physics, and chemistry etc
 or to be accepted as art like painting, music, sculpture, poetry etc
 kala kaa sambandh maanav-jati vastuon yaa vishyon se hota he
 This is why art is individual or completely individual
 vyakti saapeksh hone ke saath-saath kisi desh vishesh or kaal-vishesh kaa bhi kala par prabhaav rahata he
 This means that the values that remain for art in a period, new changes are present in the future and they should be accepted in other countries also, it is not necessary
 ek vyakti ko kisi vastu main ucch kalatmak abhivyakti lag rahi he
 But to others she does not look like this
 atah kala kii dharna prayek vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn hua karti he
 Art is related to the emotional instinct of the human heart
 usamen vyakti kii soundaryanubhuti kaa put mila rahata he
 The purpose of art is also to provide beauty, or to provide joy, not to do an elemental analysis of something
 kala ke swaroop kii in sabhi visheshtaon kii kasuti par parakhane se gyaat hota he ki bhashaa-vigyaan kala nahin he
 Because it is not related to the plausibility of the heart but to the philosophical view of the intellect
 bhashaa-vigyaan kaa uddeshy soundaryanubhuti karana yaa manoranjan karana bhi nahin he
 That makes our intellectual thinking sharp
 bhashaa ke astitv kaa tattvik moolyankan karata he
 His approach is rational
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke nishkarsh kisi vyakti, raashtra yaa kaal ke aadhaar par parivartit nahin hote hai tathaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan kaa mul aadhaar jo bhashaa he vah maanavkrut padaarth nahin he
 Therefore, we cannot count linguistics in the field of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii upyogita isamen he ki vah bhashaa sikhaane kii kala kaa gyaan karaata he
 For this reason, Sweet has called grammar a language as both an art and a science
 bhashaa kaa shuddh uccharan, prabhaavshaalee prayog kala kii koti main rakhe ja sakate hai
 Linguistics cannot be kept within the limits of art, when it is decided that the question arises as to whether linguistics, physics, chemistry etc
 are subjects like science? anek vidwaanon kii dharna main bhashaa-vigyaan vishuddh vigyaan nahin he
 According to his belief, all the experiments of linguistics have not yet been achieved to perfection and hence its conclusions cannot be called final conclusions
 iske saath hi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi nishkarsh vigyaan kii bhanti saarvbhaumik or saarvkalik bhi nahin he
 Just as mathematics has 2 + 2 = 4 everlasting, inferential conclusions that are universally accepted, linguistics does not have an unquestionable conclusion of this kind
 vigyaan main tathyon kaa sankalan or vishleshan hota he or dhwani ke niyam adhikanshtah vikalparahit hi hai, atah kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bhashaa-vigyaan ko manviki evam vigyaan ke madhya main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 After considering it, we see that in today's fast progress of science, every particular knowledge is becoming old and unscientific in front of its upcoming knowledge
 nity naveen avishkaron ke aaj ke yug main vaigyanik drushti nity sookshm se sookshmatar or naveen se navyatar hoti chali ja rahi he
 In view of today's developed field of knowledge, many scientific beliefs have become outdated and faded
 newton kaa prakaash siddhanth bhi ab sandeh kii drushti se dekha jane laga he
 This proves that in the light of new knowledge, ancient knowledge is also excluded from the field of science
 atah vishuddh gyaan kii drushti se vichaar karne par bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham vigyaan ke hi seemaa-kshetra main pate hai
 Linguistics is definitely a science under which we gain special knowledge of language
 yah sahi he ki abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan kaa vaigyanik str par purnatah vikaas nahin ho paaya he
 This is the reason why Grasmann and Werner had to improve by following the famous Grimm-rule
 ukt sudhaaron se purv grim kaa dhwani niyam nischit niyam hi mana jaataa tha or sudhaaron ke baad bhi vah nischit niyam hi mana jaataa he
 Thus, there is no opposition to science due to the refutation of old principles in the light of new knowledge
 vastav main yahi shuddh vigyaan he
 After 1930, where descriptive linguistics gained importance again, there has been rapid development since then
 jab se dhwani ke kshetra main yantron kii sahaayta se naye-naye pareekshan prarambh hue hai tathaa praapt nishkarsh puri tarah niyamit hone lage hai, tab se hi bhashaa-vigyaan dhire-dhire pragati karata hua vigyaan kii shrenee main mana jane laga he
 a major feature of science is its experimentalism
 america vidvan balum feeld ke baad america bhashaa vigyaniyon ne dhwani-vigyaan evam rup-vigyaan aadi ke saath bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paddati ke rup main praayogic bhashaa-vigyaan kaa badi tivrata ke saath vikaas kiya he
 Under this method, linguistics is becoming the subject of laboratories and many instruments have been invented for it
 yah dekh kar nishchit rup main is vishay ko vigyaan hi kaha jayega, isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 Nowadays, where the tradition of using the word science has been in place for the classical subjects like social science, psychology etc
, then linguistics based on pure cause-work tradition cannot be termed as science in any sense
 dow shyamsundar das ne apane granth bhashaa rahasy main likhaa he- In the words of Mangal Dev Shastri dow bholanath tiwari ke ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ granth main yah paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he- By considering all the definitions given above, it is known that there is no difference between them
 dow shyamsundar das kii paribhaasha main jahaan keval bhashavigyaan par hi drushti kendrit rahi he vahin mangaldev shastri evam bholanath tiwari ne apni paribhaashaon main bhashaa vigyaan ke adhyayan ke prakaaron ko bhi samahit kar liya he
 Definitions are good that are concise and clear
 is prakaar ham bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek naveen paribhaasha is prakaar de sakate hai- “jis adhyayan ke dwaara maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaae, use bhashaa-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 " duusare shabdon main bhashaa-vigyaan vah he jisamen maanviya bhashaaon kaa sookshm or vyapak vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Except the current form of language, the rest of the study material is available only from literature to linguistics
 yadi aaj hamaare saamne sanskrit, greek or avesta sahitya na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan kabhi yah jaanane main safal na hota ki ye teenon bhashaayen kisi ek mul bhashaa se nikali hai
 Similarly, if Hindi literature from the early to modern period was not in front of us, how could linguistics study the historical development of Hindi language? bhashaa-vigyaan kisi prakaar se bhi bhashaa kaa adhyayan kare use pag-pag par sahitya kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of the naughty boys of Bundelkhand- vyakaran kahata he ki yah kya bhalaa he, pracheen sahitya kaa adhyayan hi use batalaayegaa ki shakatayan ke pratham sutara ‘uun namah siddham’ kaa hi yah bigadaa hua rup he
 Literature also succeeds in finding solutions to many of its problems with the help of linguistics
 dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne bhashaa-vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par jysikrut ‘padmavat’ ke bahut se shabdon ko unke mul roopon se jod kar unke arthon ko spasht kiya he
 It has also taken substantial help in determining the pure text
 atah sahitya or bhashaa-vigyaan donon ek duusare ke sahaayak hai
 Language is a reflection of our thoughts and thoughts, so with the help of language many problems can be solved
 vishesh rup se arthvigyaan to manovigyaan par puri tarah se aadhaarit he
 Psychology also provides adequate help in the study of syntax
 kabhi-kabhi dhwani-parivartan kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye bhi manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Child psychology and psychology of underdeveloped people also helps us in knowing the origin and initial form of language
 manovigyaan ko bhi apni chikitsa-paddati main rogi kii ulajlul baton kaa arth jaanane ke liye bhashaa-vigyaan se sahaayta leni padati he
 Therefore, with the help of linguistics, a psychologist can be successful in detecting the patient's ailments
 bhashaa-vigyaan or manovigyaan ke ghanishtha sambandhon ke kaaran hi aajkal bhashaa manovigyaan yaa psycolinginvasticks naamak ek nayi adhyayan-paddati kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 Language is called the sound emanating from the mouth, so in linguistics, how does the air move from within, what changes do it cause due to larynx, larynx, nasal cavity, crow, palate, teeth, tongue, lip, throat, hoarseness and nose and One has to study how sound is received by the ear
 isamen sharir-vigyaan hi uski sahaayta karata he
 Eclipse of written language is done by eye and study of this process is also done under linguistics
 iske liye bhi use sharir vigyaan kaa rini hona padataa he
 Linguistics and geography also have a deep connection
 kuch logon ke anusaar kisi sthaan kii bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa uski bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the language spoken in a place, there are definitely words for trees, plants, birds, animals and food etc
 But if any of them ends, then its name also gets attached to the language there
 ‘somalata’ shabd kaa prayog aaj hamaari bhashaa main nahin hota
 The reason for this omission is probably geographical
 kisi sthaan main ek bhashaa kaa dur tak prasar na hona, bhashaa main kam vikaas hona tathaa kisi sthaan main bahut si boliyon kaa hona bhi bhugolic paristhitiyon kaa hi parinaam hota he
 The castes living on inaccessible mountains are unable to spread their dialect due to low mutual contact
 nadiyon ke aar-paar rahane vaale logon kii boli-bhashaa saamaanya bhashaa se hat kar bhinn hoti he
 In doing linguistic studies of the names of countries, cities, rivers and provinces etc
, geography provides great recreational material
 arth-vichaar ke kshetra main bhi bhugol bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta karata he
 Geography also helps in considering the problems of 'camel', how camel came out of buffalo and why 'sandhava' means horse and salt
 bhashaa-vigyaan kii ek shakha bhashaa-bhugol kii adhyayan-paddati to thik bhugol kii hi bhanti hoti he
 Similarly, linguistics is also helpful in studying the geography of prehistoric times of a place
 itihaas kaa bhi bhashaa-vigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh he
 With regard to three forms of history, political history, religious history, social history - its relation with linguistics is being shown here
 bhashavigyaan ke adhyayan main tarkshastra, bhautikashastra evam maanav-shaastra jaise anya gyaan ke kshetra bhi badi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 Many kinds of superstitions in humans take place which affect their language
 bhartiya saamaj main striyaan apane pati kaa naam ghuma-firaakar leti he, sidhaa-spasht nahin
 At night giant insects are not named
 ve apane ladke kaa naam maange, chhedi, bechu, ghurhu, katvaaru alichaar yaa lenda, aadi rakhte hai
 Apart from superstitions, many other socio-psychology related clauses have to resort to the branches of anthropology
 is prakaar gyaan ke anek kshetra- samskruti-adhyayan, shikshashastra, sankhyikee, paath-vigyaan - aadi bhashaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh rakhte hai
 The field of human language is the field of linguistics
 sansarbhar ke sabhy-asabhy manushyon kii bhashaaon or boliyon kaa adhyayan bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat kiya jaataa he
 In this way, linguistics does not only study civilized-literary languages, but also the study of those languages which are lost in the pride of the past, which are not in vogue, barbaric-unfriendly dialects
 vishay-vibhaajan kii drushti se bhashavigyaan ko bhashaa-sanrachana evam 'arth kaa adhyayan' main baanta jaataa he
 In it, apart from analyzing and describing the language from a scientific point of view, comparative studies between different languages are also done
 bhashavigyaan ke do paksh hai- tattvik or vyavhaarik
 In addition, linguistics has a deep connection with other branches of knowledge science
 isse samajabhashavigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, gananamulak bhashavigyaan, aadi isaki vibhinn shakhaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The following are the minor areas of linguistics: vaakya-vigyaan : bhashaa main sara vichaar-vinimay vaakyon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 The department of linguistics in which it is considered is called syntax or syntax
 iske teen rup hai- Syntax is related to the psychology of the speaking society
 isliye bhashaa-vigyaan kii yah shakha bahut kathin he
 Morphology: The construction of a sentence is based on terms or forms
 atah vaakya ke baad pad yaa rup kaa vichaar mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Under meteorology, all the instruments have to be considered from the metal, prefix, suffix etc
 shabd-vigyaan : rup yaa pad kaa aadhaar shabd he
 The words composition or history can be considered from these two points of view
 kisi vyakti yaa bhashaa kaa vichaar bhi iske antargat kiya jaataa he
 Thesaurus and etymology come under the limits of the field of word science itself
 bhashaa ke shabd samooh ke aadhaar par bolne vaale kaa saanskrithik itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 Phonology: The basis of the word is sound
 dhwani-vigyaan ke antargat dhvaniyon kaa anek prakaar se adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Under it, phonology is a separate subdivision in which the sound-producing organs — buccal-vocal, nasal-vocal, vocal apparatus, sound-instrument, as well as the process of hearing are also studied
 is adhyayan ke do rup hai-aitihaasik or doosraa tulanaatmak
 The Grimm rule is related to this
 arth-vigyaan : vaakya kaa bahari ang dhwani par samaapt ho jaataa he yah bhashaa kaa bahari kalevar he iske aage uski aatma kaa kshetra prarambh hota he jise ham arth kehete hai
 a word without meaning is meaningless like a selfless body
 atah arth bhashaa kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he
 In semantics, the development of the meanings of words and its reasons are considered
 kisi bhi adhyayan ko ham vaigyanik tab kehete hai jab usamen ek nishchit prakriya ko apana kar chalate hai
 Linguistics is also tied to certain processes for the purposeful rational analysis of a language
 inhen prakriyaaon ke aadhaar par abhi tak bhashaa-vigyaan ke paanch prakaar ke adhyayan hamen praapt hote hai- Language is usually studied with the following terms: varnatmak paddati dwaara ek hi kaal kii kisi ek bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 For this, the principles highlighted in it, on the basis of which the creative features of language-specific can be explained
 dhyatavya he ki is paddati main ek saath vibhinn kaalon ko bhashaa kaa samavesh nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki har kaal kii bhashaa ke vishleshan ke liye pruthak-pruthak siddhanton kaa prayojan padegaa
 Panini is the largest linguist not only in India, but also in the world, who has done a detailed and comprehensive study of the language in descriptive form
 katyayan evam patanjali bhi isi koti main aate hai
 Among Greek scholars, Thrax, Discolus and Erodean also did notable work in this area
 panini se purna prabhavit hokar bluemfield ne san 1932 i
 main 'language' naamak apana granth prakashit karwaakar varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati dwaara do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon kii tulana kii jaati he
 It can also be called a mixed method, because the basis of both the descriptive method and the historical method is taken
 vivaran ke liye kisi ek kaal ko nishchit karnaa hota he or tulana ke liye kam-se-kam do bhashaaon kii apeksha hoti he
 Thus, comparative method can be called the sum of descriptive method and historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati kinhin do bhashaaon par lagu ho sakati he
 For example, comparison is also done in Indian languages - Bhojpuri etc
 Or comparative study of hindi-english, hindi-russian, hindi-persian is also done
 arthath isamen kshetragat seemaa nahin he
 Scholars like William Jones, France Bopp, Maxmüller, Curtius, August Schlikher, have made significant contributions to the development of comparative linguistics
 par, abtak tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan main un siddhanton kii badi kami he, jinke aadhaar par do bhinn bhashaaon kaa vargeekaran vaigyanik nahin ban sakaa
 The structural method is the sequel to the descriptive method
 america main is paddati kaa vishesh prachaar ho rahaa he
 In this, mechanical devices are being given more importance, which will facilitate special translation
 jalig haris ne 'methaids in strectural lingusticks ' naamak pustak likhakar is paddati ko viksit kiya
 Linguistics, like other branches of science, has experimental aspects, which require systems of experimentation and laboratory
 bhinn-bhinn yantric prayogon ke dwaara uccharnatmak swanvigyaan, bhautik swanvigyaan or shravnatmak swanvigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is also called experimental phonology, mechanical phonology or laboratory phonology
 isamen darpan jaise saamaanya upkaran se lekar jatiltam vaidyut upkarnon kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 As a result, full cooperation of mathematicians, physicists and engineers in the field of linguistics is expected
 kritrim taalu or kritrim taalu projector kii sahaayta se vyaktivishesh ke dwaara uccharit swanon ke uccharan sthaan kii pariksha kii jaati he
 The Kayamograph is useful for determining the resonance and life of the swans to know the resonance and timelines
 laringo scope se swaryantr kii sthiti kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The endoscope is an improved form of laryngoscope
 osilograph kii tarangen swanon ke bhautik swaroop ko parde par yaa film par atyant spashtataa se ankit kar detii he
 The same work is done more successfully by spectographs or sonographs
 spectograph jo chitra prastut karata he unhen pattern plabac dwaara phir se suna ja saktaa he
 Recorded material can be heard at a slow speed with the help of speechstretcher
 inke atirikt or bhi chote bade yantra hai, jinase bhashavaigyanik adhyayan main paryaapt sahaayta lee ja rahi he
 Among French linguists, Ruio wrote a treatise about the use of phonology
 landan main pro farth ne vishesh taluyantr kaa vikaas kiya
 For the measurement of vowels, as the lines of the vowel point or the quadrilateral are set, they form the basis lines for the measurement of consonants, by which the utterances can be described exactly
 danniel jans or ida ward ne bhi angreji swanvigyaan par mahatvapurn kaary kiya he
 Armstrong, Bethel and Boyanus are the main speakers of French, German and Russian languages
 saidhantik or praayogic swanvigyaan par samaan rup se kaam karanevaale vyaktiyon main nimnlikhit mukhya hai: stateson, negus potter, green or cop, martin zeus, hefnar, maul aadi
 a new mechanical effort has started here, which is related to vocabulary, semantics and grammatical forms
 yantric anuwaad ke liye vaindyut computaron kaa upyog vaigyanik yug kii ek vishesh dein he
 It is a very interesting and useful subject of applied linguistics

 bharat or anya vistaar main pracheen kaal main singhon kii prajati kaa mahatv rahaa he or lokvartaon main singh ko jangal kaa raja kahan jaataa he
 The lion is also mentioned in ancient symbols
 sanathan dharm main maan amba kaa vaahan singh he
 Later, the lion species began to become extinct not only in India but also in the spread of Asia and around 1900 only 15 lions were left in the Gujarat region
 tab junagarh ke tatkaaleen nawab dwaara gir kshetra ko singho ke liye arakshit ghoshit karke singho ke shikaar par pratibandh laga diya tha
 In ancient times, lions were also found all over India and other countries of Asia
 singapore kaa naam singh ke upar se padaa he jiskaa arth singhon kaa nagar hota he
 In the ancient texts of India, there is mention of hunting of lions by the kings to show bravery
 bharat main kuch jati ke log apana upnaam bhi singh rakhte hai
 Singh is considered a symbol of valor and valor

 In India other than Gir, the extension of the lion was found in living condition in 1984, the mention of which is recorded
 sambhavit bihar main 1840, purvi vindhyas or bundelkhand main 1885, dilli main 1834, bhawalpur main 1842, madhya bharat or rajasthan main 1870 or pashvimi vistaar main 1880 ke aasapaas singh vilupt ho gaye
 In 1900, there were only lions left in Gujarat and the number of living lions was only 15 when the then Nawab of Junagadh declared Gir Extension as a sanctuary and banned hunting
 uske baad gir main singho kaa sanvardhan hua he or singho kii sankhya main badhotaree hui he
 In the last few years, from the natural forests of Gir, the Singhs migrated to some of the expanses of Amreli district and made this extension their place of residence
