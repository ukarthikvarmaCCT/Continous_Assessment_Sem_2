 The same system is used in elections to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies of India
 ise "saral bahutmat pranali" bhi kehete hai
 The candidate who gets the most votes is chosen
 yah pranali saamanyat: ek sadasyeey nirvachan kshetra pranali se sambhddha hoti he
 Three things are said in criticism of this system
 pehali yah ki iske antargat sarvaadhik mat praapt karne vaala ummidavaar nirvaachit ho jaataa he, bhale hi nirvaachak mandal ke kaaphi bade samudaay ne uske viruddh mat die hon
 Even when elected by a minority community, he also becomes a representative of the majority community that has a heinous vote
 bharat ke 1952 ke pratham nirvachan main anek vijayi ummidavaaron ke maamle main yahi hua tha
 The second thing is that this system is compatible with the same bipartisan tradition as the UK, but it eliminates the weak and minority parties
 usamen vibhinn prakaar ke alpsankhyak samudaayon ko paryaapt pratinidhitiv hi nahin mil paata
 The third point is that this system often helps to show the communities of voters who have only a very small majority, an increase in the House
 sampurna matdaan ke anupaat main kisi dal ko milane vaale kul maton dwaara us dal ke jitne sadsy nyaayat: chune jane chahie usase kahin adhik chun liye ja sakate hai
 This was what happened in 1952 India's first general election
 kuch raajnneetik vichaarkon evam rajanetaaon ne yah suzav diya he ki jis dal kii sanmati se sarkaar chalane vaali ho use kam se kam kul matadaataaon kii bahusankhya kaa samarthan to praapt hona hi chahie
 Keeping this goal in mind, some reforms have been suggested in the electoral system
 punaravartit gupt matdaan-pranali in sudhaaron main se ek he
 The simplest approach is the one used in elections conducted by legislative assemblies, for example, in the election of candidates for the post of President and vice-president by the United States Party Conference
 shalaka paddati dwaara gupt matadaanon kii shrunkhlaa tab tak chalati rahati he jab tak koi ummidavaar pade hue samast maton main se ekantat: sarvaadhik mat praapt nahin kar letaa
 The 'system of victory of the most voted person' is always always favorable to the largest parties and weak and unfavorable to minority parties
 aanuyatik pratinidhitiv kaa sahaara liye bina hi is pravriti ko dur karne ke liye kuch tareeke sujhaaye gaye hai kintu in sari pranaaliyon ke prayog ke liye bahusadasyeey nirvaachak kshetra apekshit hote hai
 Under this, a candidate can be elected in the first secret ballot only if he gets the highest number of votes out of all the votes cast
 aisa sambhav na hone par namwapasi ke liye kuch samay diya jaataa he
 In France, it was given a week or fifteen days
 iske baad doosraa gupt matdaan hota he
 The candidate who gets the most votes in this election wins
 is tarah chunaav kaa parinaam atant: sarvadhak mat praapt vyakti kii vijay kii paddati, se hi nishchit hota he
 This system was used during the Third Republic of France
 spashtat: bharat main vidhaan sabha ke nirvachan jaise bade paimaane par hone vaale chunaavon main is pranali kaa prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Each elector indicates the order of their preference by writing 1, 2, 3, etc
 marks on the ballot in front of the candidates' names
 pratham variyataon kii gananaa pehle kar lee jaati he
 If more than two candidates appear in this calculation, then the candidate who has got the first preference votes is removed from the election competition
 iske baad matadaataaon kii dwitiya variyataon ko bache hue upyukt ummidavaar yaa ummidavaaron main baant diya jaataa he
 Thus the process of cancellation and transfer of sequential preferences continues until a candidate gets the maximum number of votes cast
 kintu jaisaa ki punaravartit gupt matdaan yaa dwitiya gupt matdaan pranali main hota he utpann hone vaali prayek nayi sthiti ke sambandh main vichaar vimarsh ke liye samay lete hue baar-baar vot dena ek baat he or ek aise chayan parinaam ke sambandh main jise pehle se thikthik nahin janaa ja saktaa mataptr par ank likh kar ek kaalpanik nirnay vyakt kar dena bilkul duusari baat he
 There remains complete doubt that a voter would have preferred "B" in comparison to "A" in the event of direct selection in the final contest
 is pranali ko bariyatamoolak mat pranali bhi kehete hai
 It was probably first proposed by Chevalier de Borda in 1770
 1930 main liveral party ne britain main ise sarvaadhik rup main sweekaar kar lene kaa aagrah kiya tha
 It is also used in some federal and state elections in Australia
 isaki saralatam vidhi yah he ki prayek nirvaachak ko keval ek hi mataptr diya jaataa he
 Suppose a constituency has to elect four members and a total of 12 thousand voters vote
 aisi sthiti main yadi kisi ummidavaar ko 2401 matadaataaon kaa samarthan praapt ho gaya to uski vijay nishchit he
 The winning number is ascertained by this formula- is sutara kaa avishkaar drup ne kiya tha isliye ise drup kota kehete hai
 In practice, the situation is that a candidate with less than Drupakota can also be selected
 japan main yah pranali 1900 se hi prayog main aa rahi hai
 It was proposed by Prade in 1831
 britain main 1867 main sudhaar adhinium ke banane ke baad kuch samay tak iskaa prayog hua tha, tab ukt adhinium dwaara bade nagaron main kai trisadasyeey nirvaachak kshetra bana diye gaye the
 Each voter was given only two votes for three places
 is pranali kaa vyaavhaarik prabhaav yah padaa tha ki pratinidhitiv ko vibhajit kar dene ke liye partiyon main saudebaji hone lagi or aise ummidavaar chhatne lage, jinaki vijay kii koi sambhaavna nahin thi
 This system came to light in 1953
 isamen matadaata ko chunaav kshetra main jitani jagahen hoti hai utane vot de diye jate hai or use isaki swatantraaa hoti he ki vah chaahe to apane saare voton ko kisi ek ummidavaar ke paksh main daal de athwa apni icchaanusaar anya ummidavaaron ko baant de
 In this system, the voters get more importance
 kabhi kabhi alpsankhyakon kaa pratinidhitiv pruthak nirvachan pranali dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he
 This was done in India during the British rule
 musalmaan log hinduon se alag apane pratinidhi chunate the
 It may also be that some places have been made safe for minorities as has been done for the enumerated castes and tribes in India
 sarvaadhik mat praapt vyakti kii vijay pranali kaa anusaran saamanyat: ek sadasyeey nirvachan kshetra main hi hota he jab ki anupatik pratinidhitiv pranali ke liye bahu sadasyeey nirvachan kshetra apekshit hote hai
 a single place cannot be divided proportionally
 kisi nirvachankshetra main prayek ummidavaar ke liye athwa ummidavaaron ko khadaa karne vaali party ke liye pade vot ke anupaat main hi jagahen nirdhaarit kii jaati hai
 There are mainly two types of proportional representation: in donon prakaar ke bhi anek rup hote hai
 They can also be mixed with each other or blended into the "first past the post" system
 " This system was invented before the development of modern party federations in Europe
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main hi saarvbhaum matadhikaar kii maang joro se hone lagi thi
 This demand could not be resisted
 kintu rajaneta "bahusnkhyakon ke atyaachaar" ke prati sanshak the
 They wanted to protect the minorities and their interests
 isi uddeshy se 1857 main udaaradaleey danish raajnneetijna si
 ji
 andras or landan ke barrister tamas her ne is pranali kaa avishkaar kiya
 The system gained prominence as John Stuart Mill, the intellectual leader of British liberalism, accepted the system and considered it in his famous treatise "representative Government" published in 1861
 is pranali ke antargat chaahe jitani bhi siten ho matadaata ko keval ek hi vot praapt hota he
 He can vote by writing 1, 2, 3, 4 etc
 in front of the candidate's name, indicating his preference for different candidates
 ise ek udhaaharan se spasht kar dena thik hoga
 Suppose there is a four-member constituency
 isamen kul 12 hajaar vot pade
 According to the Drup quota, who gets at least 2401 first preference votes, he is sure to be elected
 ab maan lijie ki maidan main 9 ummidavaar hai or inamen se keval do ko hi drup kota se adhik mat milte hai- ek ko 2451 or duusare ko 2481; bache hue vot shesh ummidavaaron main bant jate hai
 In the first count both of the above candidates are declared elected
 iske baad duusari gananaa hogi
 In the second count, the candidate receiving the minimum number of votes can be removed from the field and the second preference of the canceled candidate and ballot can be transferred to the remaining candidates in addition to the two winning candidates
 doosraa tarika yah he ki unke sabhi matadaataaon kii dwitiya variyatayen dekh lee jaaain, shesh ummidavaaron main se prayek ko praapt kul vot gin liye jaaain or prayek ko mili kul vot kaa bhaag de diya jaae
 Thus, whoever gets the Drup quota from both the candidates should be declared elected
 voton kii gananaa isi tarah tab tak chalati jaaegi jab tak sabhi siton ke liye drup kota praapt karne vaale ummidavaar na mil jaaain
 Its purpose is to assign a value to each vote
 ireland or tasmaania ke ganatantron main mukhya praatinidhik sabha ke chunaavon ke liye isi pranali kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 It is also used in the elections to the Second Houses of Australia and New South Wales
 bharat main bhi vidhaan parishadon ke sadasyon ke chunaav main yahi pranali apanaayi jaati he
 This is another type of proportional representation
 iske antargat prayek matadaata se kaha jaataa he ki vah vyaktigat ummidavaaron main chunaav na karke ummidavaaron kii un soochiyon main chunaav kare jo vibhinn dalon yaa sanghatanon dwaara prastut kii gai hai
 This method was adopted in Belgium in 1899
 holland denmark, norwein, sweden, finland, france, pashchimi germany or italy main bhi yahi tarika prachlit he
 This system has various forms
 yahan do pramukh roopon par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 One of these is called "proportional representation by highest average"
 belgium ke di" haant ne iskaa udbhaavan kiya tha, isiilie ise di, haant kaa niyam bhi kehete hai
 Seats are divided one by one
 yadi kisi ummidavaar ko sambandhit seat mil gayi to prayek seat ke liye praapt sarvaadhik ausat mataptr paanevaala prayek ummidavaar suchi main sthaan paa jaataa he
 The formula to achieve this result is that the total initial votes of each list on the occasion of each allocation are then divided by one more than the number of seats received
 pratham vinidhaan ke samay prayek suchi ke liye vibhaajak, hota he
 And for this reason the initial votes of the lists are average
 dwitiya vinidhaan ke samay vijayi suchi kaa vibhaajak 2 hoga jab ki shesh kaa vibhaajak 1 hi rah jaataa he
 Similarly, seats are distributed at the time of third and fourth allocation
 duusari vidhi "mahattam shesh" dwaara anupatik pratinidhitiv kehete hai
 In this, the total number of votes polled is divided by the number of seats assigned
 phir prayek suchi ko utane hi sthaan de die jate hai jitani baar ukt labdh sankhya prayek suchi main aayi hoti he
 If even after this, some seats are left, their allocation shall be taken out from the initial votes of each list, by expanding the number of votes remaining by removing those votes which she has used to gain one or more seats
 Is done at a sequential pace
 pawan bharat ke ek yuva cartoonkaar hai
 He is among the few cartoonists of Bihar who made cartoon art popular among the common people in Bihar
 ve hindustan naamak hindi samachaarpatr ke liye cartoon banaate hai
 At the age of 13, Pawan, who ran away from home to make cartoons, has to make cartoons and teach children cartoons - two things are most preferred

 The 1959 Walt Disney animated film on 'sleeping Beauty', the most familiar in the English-speaking world, is as much taken from Shaikovsky's ballet as Perrault's
 perult kii katha kaa mul tatv do bhaagon main banta he
 Some folklorists believe that they were in fact separate narratives, as they are later made in the Grimes version and added by Basil and later by Perrault in their imitation
 lambe samay kii kaamana puri hone par shahzaadi ke namakaran anushthan par godmadar ke rup main aamantrit pariyon ne use soundarya, budhimatta tathaa sangeet kii pratibha jaise uphaar die
 However, one of them was unseen, as an evil angel, put the princess as a gift under a spell saying that when she was young, the finger of the princess would pierce in a spindle and she would die
 One of those noble fairies did not completely remove the effect of that spell, but she said that she would rather sleep for a hundred years than die, until her true love and a princess would wake her up by kissing her
 shahenshaah ne apane puure samrajya main charkha kaatne yaa silne par yaa use rakhane par mrityu dand sunaate hue pratibandh laga diya, lekin sab vyarth sabit hua
 When Shehzadi was fifteen or sixteen years old, she met an elderly woman who was spinning at the palace fort
 shahzaadi ne is anokhe kaam ko aajamaane kii tamanna zaahir kii or niyati ne apana khel khelaa
 The evil angel's curse was fulfilled
 nek pari lauti or usne mahal ke sabhi logon ko neend ke agosh main daal diya
 Surrounding the palace with a forest full of thorn bushes, it was removed from the eyes of the outside world so that those who tried to infiltrate it first had to embrace death by falling prey to thorns
 jab sau saal guzar gaye to ek shahjade ne, jisane is jaadu ke bare main sun rakhaa tha, us jangal ko chirane kaa johar dikhaaya

 Seeing the beauty of the princess, he was enchanted and sat on his knees in front of her

 and starting with the version of Brothers Graeme, according to the modern version, they all started laughing after that
 neend se jaage shahi daandaata dwaara gupachup shaadi karawaaye jane ke baad shahzada jon shahzaadi se milane aata rahaa, jisane use do santaanen loror tathaa lee jor deen
 He kept this thing hidden from the mother of his demon dynasty
 jab vah singhaasana par baitha to apni patni or bacchon ko rajdhani le aayaa tathaa unhen apane rani maa ke rajpratinidhi mandal main chhod kar khud padosi raja kaantalabutte se yuddh karne gaya
 The demonic mother sent the young queen and her children to a secluded house in the forest and asked her cook to prepare the boy with sauce for dinner
 Adamzat cook served a sheep in place of the boy, which satisfied the queen mother
 phir usne ladki kii maang kii, lekin usee lajiz sos ke saath banaaye gaye taaze bakre se vah khush hui
 When the demon demanded the young queen to be served, the cook offered to cut her throat, so that she could go to her children whom the demon now considered dead

 He soon got a glimpse of this trick and built a pit in the courtyard full of poisonous snakes and other dangerous creatures
 On such a delicate occasion, the king returned and when the demon exposed himself, he threw himself into the pit which was eaten by those animals
 uske baad sab hansi-kushi rahane lage
 Apart from the difference in sentiment, the most notable differences of this story are that the reason for sleep was not a curse but a prophecy; That the king did not wake Talia by giving her a kiss, but she raped him and when he gave birth to two children, one of them sucked her fingers which caused the piece of hemp stuck in her finger to come out due to which she slept and She woke up and that the woman who tortured him so much and tried to eat him and her children was not the king's mother but his jealous wife
 saas kii ishya utani prerak nahin, haalanki pari kathaon main yah aam he
 Some predecessor elements of the medieval civilized romance Perforest have contributed to this narrative, in which a princess named Gelandine falls in love with a young man named Troylaus
 uske pita yuvak ko apane aap ko ladki ke kaabil sabit karne ke liye kuch kaam karne hetu bhejte hai or jab vah chalaa jaataa he to jelandine jaadu bhare neend main kho jaati he
 Troylaus finds her and makes her pregnant while sleeping; When their child is born, he removes flax from her finger, due to which she was lost in sleep
 vah apni ungali main troylos dwaara pahanaai gayi anguthi se pahachaanati he ki vah bachche kaa pita he tathaa vah usase byaah karne ke liye apane dussahasik kaary se waapas laut kar aata he
 The preceding influences are derived from the story of the sleepy Brinhild of the Walsanga Saga and the virtuous female martyrs of earlier Christian hegeography traditions
 darasal yah brimahild kaa astitv hi tha jisane grim bhaaiyon ko apane agle sanskaran main is kahani ko mitaane kii bajaay ise shaamil karne kii prerana di, jaisaa ki unhone perult kii kritiyon se prerana lete hue apane un anyaanya kritiyon main bhi kiya he jinhen ve vishuddhtah francisi maanate the
 The latter part of the story may be influenced by St
 Ganevieve, where shehzadi and her children are almost ready to be killed and hidden
 yah pariktha aarne-thompsan ke 410wein prakaar ke rup main vargeekrut he
 Shehzadi's name has been changed
 san, moon and taalia main uskaa naam taalia rakhaa gaya he 
 Perrault removed it and allowed her to remain anonymous, although her daughter was named "lauror"
 grim bhaaiyon ne apane 1812 sangrah main uskaa naam "brir rose" rakhaa
 The transfer was taken by Disney for the film, in which she was named Aurora
 jon stegin ne telestory pregents main use "rosebed" naam diya
 The Grimm brothers included a separate Briar Rose in their collection
 jaisaa ki perult tathaa besil ne iske prachlit ant ke bare main kaha he : katha kaa samaapan shahzaade ke aagaman par ho jaataa he
 Shehzadi is named Rosamond in some translations of Graeme's legend
 bhaaiyon ne is kahani ko is aadhaar par khaarij karnaa uchit samajha chunki vah perult ke sanskaran se liya gaya tha, lekin brinhild katha kii upasthiti ke kaaran ve ise ek vaastavik german katha ke rup main shaamil karne hetu maan gaye
 Nevertheless, this is the only prevalent German style of narrative and Perrault's influence is almost certain
 grim bhaaiyon ne apni kathaon ke pehle sanskaran main da evil madar-in-lau naamak ek khandbaddh pariktha ko bhi shaamil kiya
 It begins with the married heroine and mother of two children, like Perrault's stories, and her mother-in-law tries to eat her children first and then the heroine
 perult ke sanskaran ke ulat yahaan nayika ne khud vyanjan main unalogon kii bajaay kisi pashu ko parosane kaa suzav diya tha or yah khand nayika kii is chintaa ke saath samaapt ho jaataa he ki vah apane bacchon ko rone se or unki awaz saas ke kaanon main padane se nahin roak sakati
 francisi prabhaav dikhaati bahut si german kathaon kii tarah yah kisi parvarti sanskaran main nahin dikhaa
 Italo Calvino incorporated a style into Italian folklore
 uski neend kaa kaaran uski maa dwaara buree mantranaa ke kaaran maangi gayi ichha thi: use isaki koi parvaah nahin thi ki pandrah saal kii umr main ungali main chubhan se uski beti mar jaati, use to bas ek beti chahie thi
 Like Pentamerone, she falls asleep when she is raped by Shehzade and her children are born when a thorn comes out when one of them sucks her finger, causing her to fall asleep
 ve is prasang ko barkaraar rakhte hai ki vah aurat jisane bacchon ko maarane kii koshish kii vah raja kii maa thi, na ki uski patni lekin usamen yah zarur jod diya ki vah unhen khud nahin khaanaa chaahati thi balki unhen raja ko parosna chaahati thi
 This version of him was taken from Calabria but he stated that all Italian versions closely follow Basil
 san, moon and taalia ke alaava besil ne is aarne-thompsan prakaar kii ek or style da yang slave kaa samavesh kiya
 The Grimm brothers also included The Glass Coffin, each other and more remotely related
 joseph jacob ne kaha ki is katha main tathaa unke mor english feiri tels naamak pustak kii da king of england and hiz thri sans naamak gypsy katha main sleeping beauty kii kaaya ek hi tarah kii thi
 The king's mother's rivalry with his newly wedded wife is also repeated in the fairy tale The Six Swans and is also shown in The Twelve Wild Ducks where she is given the appearance of the king's stepmother, but in these stories her demonicity Has been deleted
 kuch lok kathakaron ne sleeping beauty kaa varnan chandra varsh kaa saura varsh dwaara pratisthaapan ke sanketak ke rup main kiya he
 However, this indicates that the evil fairy was only the thirteenth fairy in the Grimm brothers' tale and the eighth in Perrault's tale
 perult kii katha main parichit vishyon tathaa tatwon main: Sleeping Beauty has been popular for repeating many fairy tales
 inamen marcedes laiki kaa elemental masters upanyaas da gates of sleep ; robin mecokinle kaa spindles and, orson scot cards kaa anchantment, jine yolen kaa brir rose, sophy mason kaa klementine tathaa bin rayees kaa sleeping beauty triyologi shaamil hai
 The curse of the fairy mother has been used in many contexts, right from the narrative
 jorge mekadonald ne ise apane sleeping beauty parody da lit princes main istemaal kiya, jisamen dusht pari maa shahzaadi ko marane kaa nahin balki gurutvkarshan kam ho jane kaa shaap detii he- jisase shaareerik vajan kam ho jane ke saath-saath vah dusron kii pidaa ko gambhirtha se lene main bhi asamarth ho jaati he
 In Andrew Lang's Prince Priigio, the queen does not believe in fairies and does not invite them; The fairies still arrive and all the fairies except the last fairy give her good gifts, which she says is "very clever" and the problem of such gifts comes to the fore
 patricia red kii anchented forest cronicals main shahzaadi afsos jataati he ki use namakaran par shaapit nahin kiya gaya
 When the other characters point out that not many other fairies are damned, she complains that in her case the wicked fairy came under the nomenclature, "she had the best time," and a proper fairy-tale character for the princess

 The earliest references to this process of "walking upward and downward in the social ladder" are found in another reference, "the Laws of Imitation", written by Gabriel Tarde

 Often, with such a change, they also become claimants of a higher status in the caste system than that which the local community has traditionally offered them



 " a clear example of Sanskritisation is the adoption of pure vegetarianism by the people of the so-called "lower castes", in imitation of the Dwij castes, which are not traditionally opposed to non-vegetarian food

 The book was an anthropological study of the Kodava community of Karnataka
 shrinivas ne pustak main likhaa: "the caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time
 Movement has always been possible, and especially in the middle regions of the hierarchy
 a caste was able, in a generation or two , to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritizing its ritual and pantheon
 In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of The Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden
 This process has been called 'sanskritization' in this book, in preference to 'brahminization', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes
 " is pustak ne tab chal rahe is vichaar ko chunauti di ki jati ek drudh or aparivartansheel sanstha he

 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors
 saamaanya vyapti kshetra ke baahar MSL seva pradaata ke upyog main ucch laagat kii vajah se ek khulaa phone yatriyon ke liye behad upyogi hota he
 This can sometimes be 10 times the price of using a closed phone as a foreigner in the general service area, even with discounted rates
 t-mobile allows its account holders to open a SIM code after a good 90 days Provide according to the FAQ
 udhaaharan ke liye, jamaika main, ek AT&T graahak bhunaai antarrashtriya seva ke liye $1
65 prati minute kaa atirikt bhugtan kar saktaa he jabaki ek B-mobile graahak ko samaan antarrashtriya seva ke liye $0
20 prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
kuch seva pradaata apane bikri ko antarrashtriya bikri par kendrit karte hai jabaki kuch kshetreey bikri par kendrit karte hai
 For example, the same b-mobile customer will pay less on local calls but more on international calls than in Jamaica's national phone C&W company
 yah mulya antar mukhyatah mudra parivartan ke kaaran hota he kyonki sim kii kharid sthaneey mudra main hoti he
 In the US, competition in these types of services does not exist because some major service providers do not offer pay-when-you-go service

 Jaimini was a great sage of ancient India
 ve purv mimasaa ke pravartak the
 He was a disciple of Vedavyas
 jaimini vedavyas ke shishy the
 It is written in Mahabharata that Veda Vyasa got the name because of expanding the Veda into four parts
 inhone jaimini ko samaveda kii shiksha di tathaa mahabharat bhi padhaayaa- These Vyas composed the Brahmasutra, based on the Upanishads
 isi ko "bhikshusutra" bhi kehete hai jiskaa ullekh panini ne ashtaadhi main kiya he
 It is clear from these episodes that Jaimini was a contemporary sage of Ved Vyasa
 vedavyas ne kauravon or pandavon ko saakshaat dekha tha
 Therefore, they must have lived in the war period of Mahabharata
 winternitz ke anusaar mahabharat kii rachana isa se purv chauthi sadi main hui hogi, kintu bhartiya vidwaanon ke anusaar 3000 varsh isa se purv hi mahabharat kaa samay ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the time of Ved Vyas will also have to be decided accordingly
 panini ne apni ashtaadhi main jis bhikshusutra kaa ullekh kiya he uske rachayita bhi yahi vedavyas hai jinhen baadaraayan vyas bhi ham kehete hai or isiliye yah baadaraayan sutara bhi kehalaata he
 Despite many opinions regarding the period of Panini, according to scholars like Goldsterk, Vasudevashran Agarwal, etc
, it must have been around 6000 years BC, it can be said
 satyavrath samashrami kaa kahana he ki jaimini niruktkaar yask ke purvavarti hai
 Yask is the predecessor of Panini
 samashrami ne yask ko isa se purv 19veen sadi main mana he
 Ved Vyasa mentions Jaimini 11 times in the Brahmasutra, Javini is also mentioned by the name "acharya" in the Ashavayana Grihamsutra (1

 mahabharat kaa "ashwamedhparv" to jaimini ke hi naam se prasiddh he
 Similarly, Jaimini has mentioned the opinion of Badarayan five times in his predecessor book, taking his name
 is prakaar vedavyas ke saath jaimini kaa ghanishtha sambandh rakhana pramanit hota he
 Therefore, both of these must have been in the same period, it does not seem to be a flaw to believe such a theory
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ke anusaar jaimini isa se aath shatak purv hi rahe honge, kintu bhartiya vidwaanon ke anusaar isa se teen hajaar varsh purv jaimini kaa samay kehane main koi vishesh aapatti nahin maaloom hoti
 The following texts are famous by the name of Jaimini: samaveda kii ek hajaar shakhaayen huin jinamein keval kauthumi, jaimineey tathaa ranayaniya, ye hi teen shakhaayen aaj milti hai

 isaliye is granth ko log "dwadash lakshani" bhi kehete hai
 There are many repetitions in the sutras in this sutra, such as "lingardarshanacha" sutras 30 times and "chanyarthdarshanam" 24 times
 isi prakaar anya sutron kii bhi punaruktiyaan hai : is granth main nimnlikhit aacharyon ke naam hai--baadaraayan, baadari, aitishayan ; karshnajini, lavukayan, kaamukayan, aatreya, aalekhan 
 In addition, Jamini has also taken his name in Mimamsutra five times by himself

 Approximately 7-8 crore people use 5
7% of India's population as mother tongue and its users are spread in many countries of the world including various parts of India and Nepal
 maithili vishwa kii sarvaadhik samrudh, shaleen or mithaas purna bhashaaon main se ek maani jaati he
 Maithili is revered as an official language in India
 maithili kii apni lipi he jo ek samrudh bhashaa kii pratham pahchaan he
 No specific steps have been taken by the Government of Nepal or anywhere in India for the development of Maithili language

 Pollen is used in pollination
 paudhe dwaara paragan kii vyavastha is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kis tarah se paragan ko istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Most flowers can be broadly divided into two groups depending on their mode of pollination
 kitparagit phool: phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se duusare ko paraag sthanantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai
 Their design is unique and the stamens are arranged so that the pollen grains themselves get transferred by sticking with birds or insectivores and migrating there when they are sitting on other plants
 kai phulon kii ek hi prajati kii kisi aakarshak visheshta ko paane ke liye, paragankarta dwaara un sabhi phulon main paraag ko stigma main sthantarit kar detii he jo bilkul sateek rup se samaan rup main vyavasthit hote hai
 Many flowers depend only on the proximity between parts of the flower for pollination, such as Saracenia or female sleeper orchids
 vaataparagit phool: vaayu ke saath paraag ko ek phool se agle phool tak le jate hai udhaaharan ke liye santi vriksh, emborsia jati kii raig ghaas or esar jati ke ped or jhaadiyaan
 They do not need to attract pollination, due to which their tendency is not of 'showy flowers'
 While the pollen of insectivorous flowers is large and glutinous in grains and is high in protein, pollen of aerated flowers is mostly of small grains, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 madhumakhi or bombal makkhi sakriy rup se vaataparagit paraag kanon ko jamaa karte hai haalaanki ye unke zyada mahatva ke nahi hote
 Some flowers are self-pollinated and use flowers that never bloom, or are self-pollinated before the flowers bloom, these flowers are called cleistogamous
 Many Viola and Salvia species have these types of flowers

 sempson kaa janm 7 june 1811 ko ednabura se 23 kilometre dur bathget naamak sthaan par ek hua tha
 His father was a very ordinary man with very little income
 sempsan padhne likhane main bahut hi hoshiyaar the har baat ki lagan thi un main sirf 14 saal ki umr main unhone ednabura vishwavidhalay main daakhila le liye tha or maatr 18 saal ki umr main apni doctori ki padhai purna kar lee thi
 The history of its discovery is also interesting
 chloroform kii khoj ednabura ke ek doctor ne kii thi
 Once in his hospital, a patient was tied with a rope to perform a poor leg operation
 uski taang main ek ghaav ho gaya tha jo sad chukaa tha uski taang kaatani padi thi
 When his leg was amputated, the patient became unconscious due to pain
 uske saath hi doctor sempson jo us vakt padhai kar rahe the vah bhi behosh ho gaye
 When he regained consciousness, he vowed that he would invent something that does not hurt the patient so much
 jab unhone is ke bare main apane saath padhne vaale mitron se baat kari tab sab ne unka majaak banaaya par unhone himmat nahi haari
 Even after becoming a doctor, he did not forget his pledge, he continued the search of this medicine, so that no patient could suffer pain during the operation
 4 navambar 1847 ko koi prayog karte samay unki nazar apane sahyogi doctor par padi jo unki banaayi ek dawa soongh rahe the or dekhte hi dekhte vah behosh ho gaye
 Sempson looked at him with his own sniff and he had the same condition as that of his associate doctor
 tabhi unki patni vahaan ai or yah dekh kar cheekh uthi or kisi or doctor ne doctor sempson kii nadee dekhi vah thik chal rahi thi usee samay doctor sempson ne aankhe khol di or hosh main aate hi vah chillaaye ki mil gaya, behosh kar ke dubaara hosh main aane kaa nuskhaa mil gaya
 Later many changes were made in this and this medicine proved to be a boon for patients
 chloroform kaa chikitsa jagat main prayog 1847 se hi aarambh ho gaya tha, kintu jald hi rogiyon par iske padane vaale vipareet prabhaav ke kaaran iske prayog par shankaaen uthne lageen thim
 In the early twentieth century, chloroform was replaced by safer and cheaper drugs
 aaj chikitsajagat main anya dawaaon ke saath-saath helothen, isofluren or sevofluren kaa prayog iske sthaan par kiya jaataa he
 The adverse effects of chloroform on the body can affect the liver, kidney and heart
 iske kaaran twachaa par salawatein or dhabbe pad sakate hai
 In addition to severe diseases like gastroentitis and diarrhea due to high amount of chloroform in the water, infection can also spread
 chloroform sunghane se bhi bachanaa chahie, jisase behoshee bhi aa sakati he or adhik maatra ke prabhaav se mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 In some places people also drink chloroform found in water
 chloroform pani main saralata se ghulansheel hota he
 Acting with oxygen and sunlight, it produces a toxic gas called phosgene
 lekin yadi chloroform ko khule main le jaaya jaae to fosgin hanirahit ho jaati he
 Teri Maang is a 1982 Hindi language film made with stars

 Rarely occur in rain forests or in dry land, although some unique subspecies have recently been described from the northwestern region of Western Australia
 maharaja ranjit singh sikh samrajya ke raja the
 They are famous as Sher-e Punjab
 maharaja ranjit ek aisi vyakti the, jinhone na keval punjab ko ek shashakt soobe ke rup main ekajute rakhaa, balki apane jite-ji angrejon ko apane samrajya ke paas bhi nahin bhatakane diya
 Ranjit Singh was born in 1780 in the house of Gujranwala Sandhawalia Jat Maharaja Maha Singh
 un dinon punjab par sikhon or afgaanon kaa raaj chalata tha jinhone puure ilaake ko kai misalon main baant rakhaa tha
 Ranjit's father Maha Singh Sukrachakia was the commander of the Missal
 pashchimi punjab main sthit is ilaake kaa mukhyalay gujranvala main tha
 Maharaja Ranjit Singh lost his eyesight at a young age due to smallpox
 mahaj 12 varsh ke the jab pita chal based or rajpaat kaa sara boj inhen ke kandhon par aa gaya
 On 12 April 1801, Ranjit assumed the title of Maharaja
 guru nanak ke ek vanshaj ne unki tajposhi sampann karai
 He made Lahore his capital and moved towards Amritsar in 1802
 maharaja ranjit ne afgaanon ke khilaaf kai ladaaiyaan ladiin or unhen pashchimi punjab kii ore khaded diya
 Now Pashtun region, including Peshawar, became their authority
 yah pehla mauka tha jab pashtunon par kisi gaiyr muslim ne raaj kiya
 After that, they also captured Peshawar, Jammu Kashmir and Anandpur

 Under his patronage, Punjab was now a very powerful province
 isi taqatvar sena ne lambey arse tak britain ko punjab hadapney se roke rakhaa
 There was also an occasion when Punjab was the only province which was not occupied by the British
 british itihaaskaar je tii whealer ke mutabik, agar vah ek peedi puraane hote, to puure hindustaan ko hi fatah kar lete
 Maharaja Ranjit himself was illiterate, but greatly encouraged education and art in his kingdom
 unhone punjab main kanoon evam vyavastha kaayam kii or kabhi bhi kisi ko mrityudand nahin di
 His diocese was secular
 He also prohibited the jizya charged with Hindus and Sikhs
 kabhi bhi kisi ko sikh dharm apnaane ke liye vivash nahin kiya
 He installed marble and gold plated at Harimandir Sahib Gurdwara in Amritsar, since then it came to be known as Golden Temple
 beshkeemtee hira kohinoor maharaja ranjit singh ke khajaane kii raunak tha
 Maharaja Ranjit died in 1839
 unki samadhi lahore main banavaai gai, jo aaj bhi vahaan kaayam he
 With his death, the British started clamping down on Punjab
 angrej-sikh yuddh ke baad 30 march 1849 main punjab british samrajya kaa ang bana liya gaya or kohinoor maharani victoria ke hujur main pesh kar diya gaya
 Ranjitsingh was born in 1780 AD
 vah ] samaaj ke prutapi raja the mahansingh ke marane par ranjitsingh baarah varsh kii avasthaa main misl sukarchakia ke netaa hue
 In 1798, when Zaman Shah returned from Punjab, he took control of Lahore
 dhire-dhire satluj se sindhu tak, jitani mislein raaj kar rahi thim, sabko usne apane vash main kar liya
 Between the Sutlej and the Yamuna, the Phulkis ruled the kingdom of Misl
 san 1806 i

 Ranjitsinh had many qualities of military leadership
 ve doordarshee the
 He was a man of dark complexion
 unki ek aankh sheetala ke prakope se chali gai thi
 But despite this he was stunning
 isliye jab tak vah jivit the, sabhi mislein dabi thim
 At that time the British kingdom had reached the Yamuna and the Phulkians, the king of Egypt, began to assume the dominion of the British state
 angrejon ne ranjitsingh ko is kaary se manaa kiya
 Ranjitsingh did not think it right to fight the British and made a pact that we would not extend our kingdom in front of Sutlej
 ranjitsingh ne francisi sainikon ko bulaakar, uski sainik kaman main apni sena ko vilayati dhang par taiyaar kiya
 Now he started attacking the southern, western and northern parts of Punjab and in ten years extended his kingdom to Multan, Peshawar and Kashmir
 ranjitsingh ne peshawar ko apane adhikaar main avashya kar liya tha, kintu us soobe par purna adhikaar karne ke liye use kai varshon tak kadaa sangharsh karnaa padaa tha
 He became the lord of the whole of Punjab; And he did not face the intervention of the British
 parantu jis samay angrejon ne napolian kii senaaon ke viruddh sikhon se sahaayta maangi thi, unhen praapt na hui
 Ranjitsinh changed the kingdom of Peshawar in 1808 AD to the name of his ambitious mother-in-law Sadakore
 kyonki yah angrejon kii agent mahila thi
 Ranjitsingh, after quarreling with his ill-fated mother-in-law, imprisoned him and took control of Hvdni's stronghold
 british sena kii ek tukdi ne bandi vidhwaa sadacor ko chhudaaya or adhikaar ko waapas dilaayaa
 Ranjit Singh did not want any quarrel with the British Army
 angrejon kii taraf se sandhi kii sharton ko bhang karne kaa aarope lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, he started preparations silently, yet in 1809 AD, he made a treaty with Lord Minto
 yadhyapi is sandhi se maharaj ko sikhon main bahut apamaanit hona padaa tha
 Due to the above treaty, the Afghan state of Punjab and Afghanistan were able to terrorize it to some extent

 main multan par chadhaai kii or adhikaar kar liya evam shah shuja se sandhi karke apane yahan rakhaa or usase ek gilaas pani ke liye 'kohenur hira' praapt kiya
 On hearing of Shah Mahmud's invasion of Kabul in 1811 AD and knowing that Mahmud intended to attack the ruler of Kashmir, he attacked Kashmir so that it would be possible for Mahmud to return and find his friendship
 kashmir ke baad isane peshawar par 1822 main chadhaai kar di, yaramuhammad khan afghaniyon kaa netritv karata hua bahut bahaduree se ladaa lekin ant main parajeet hua
 The Sikhs also suffered a great loss in this war
 1838 main peshawar par ranjitsingh ke adhikaar se bhaybheet hokar dostamohammad khan kabulanaresh bahut bhaybheet hua or rus tathaa iran se dosti kar lee
 Keeping this in mind, the British themselves organized a threesome with Ranjitsinh and Shahshuja

 He also wanted to offer the Cohenoor diamond on Jagannathmandir, but that diamond had to be disintegrated by going abroad
 maharaja ke baad sikhon ke aapasi vaimnasy, rashtradroh tathaa angreji kootneetijyata kaa jawaab na dene kii asamarthta se sikh rajya mit gaya
 It is about the year 1812
 punjab par maharaja ranjit singh kaa ecchhatra rajya tha
 At that time, Maharaja Ranjit Singh started a campaign to free Kashmir from the clutches of Atamohammad, the Subedar of Kashmir
 is abhiyaan se bhaybheet hokar atamohammad kashmir chhodkar bhaag gaya
 There was another reason behind the Kashmir campaign
 atamohammad ne mahmud shah dwaara parajeet shahshuja ko shergarh ke kile main kaid kar rakhaa tha
 To get her freed from captivity, her Begum Wafa Begum came to Lahore and prayed to Maharaja Ranjit Singh and said that you kindly release my husband from the captivity of Atma Mohammad, in exchange for this favor, the prized Kohinoor diamond will be presented to you
 shahshuja ke kaid ho jane ke baad vafa begum hi un dinon afghanistan kii shasika thi
 Zaman Shah, the grandson of Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded India in the greed to seize this Kohinoor, had his eyes taken out by his brother Mahmud Shah himself in the prison by terrible torture
 jamaan shah ahamed shah abdali ke bete taimur shah kaa betaa tha, jiskaa bhai tha mahmud shah
 Astu, Maharaja Ranjiti Singh himself wanted him to liberate Kashmir from Atamohammad
 at: suyog aane par maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya
 His Diwan Mohkamchand surrounded the fort of Shergarh and released Wafa Begum's husband Shahshuja and brought him to Lahore near Wafa Begum
 rajkumaar khadgasingh ne unhen mubarak haveli main tehraaya
 But Wafa Begum delayed the offering of Kohinoor diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh as promised
 yahaan tak ki kai maheene biit gaye
 When the Maharaja asked Shahshuja about the Kohinoor diamond, both he and his begum started making excuses
 jab zyada jor diya gaya to unhone ek nakli hira maharaja ranjit singh ko saunp diya, jo johariyon ke pareekshan kii kasuti par nakli sabit hua
 Ranjit Singh was filled with anger and Mubarak Haveli was surrounded
 do din tak vahaan khaanaa nahin diya gaya
 The first of June 1813 was when Maharaja Ranjit Singh came to Shahshuja and then inquired about Kohinoor
 dhoort shahshuja ne kohinoor apni pagadi main chipa rakhaa tha
 Somehow the Maharaja came to know about this
 at: unhone shahshuja ko kabul kii rajgaddi dilaane ke liye "gurugranth sahab" par haath rakhkar pratigya kii
 Then he changed his turban to Kohinoor to make him a "turban-changing brother"
 parde kii oot main baithi vafa begum maharaja kii chaturaai samaj gayi
 Now Kohinoor had reached Maharaja Ranjit Singh and he was satisfied that he had liberated Kashmir
 unki ichha thi ki ve kohinoor heere ko jagannathpuri ke mandir main pratishthit bhagwaan jagannatha ko arpit karen
 He was famous for offering mana gold to Hindu temples
 kaashi ke vishwanath mandir main bhi unhone akut sona arpit kiya tha
 But his desire to reach Jagannath God could not be fulfilled due to the treasurer of the treasurer Beliram
 maharaja ranjit singh kii mrityu ke pashchaat angrejon ne san 1845 main sikhon par akraman kar diya
 The Sikh army was bravely fighting the British in the Ferozepur region
 kintu sikh sena ke hi senapati lalasinh ne vishwasghaat kiya or morcha chhodkar lahore palaayan kar gaya
 Due to this, the Sikh army lost even after reaching near Vijay
 angrejon ne sikhon se kohinoor hira le liya
 At the same time, Kashmir and Hazara were also taken away from the Sikhs because the British had fined one and a half crores rupees to the Sikhs, the economically affected Sikhs were able to give only 50 lakh rupees in any way
 lard harding ne england kii rani victoria ko khush karne ke liye kohinoor hira landan pahunchaa diya, jo "east india company" dwaara rani victoria ko saunp diya gaya
 In those days Dilip Singh, son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, was there
 kuch logon kaa kathan he ki dilip singh se hi angrejon ne landan main kohinoor hadapaa tha
 The jewelers carved the Kohinoor for 1 month and 8 days and then it was taken by Queen Victoria in her crown

 The British ruled here, but the local people always kept rioting against them from time to time
 chandaaran, manda mandal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke adilabadu jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The power generated by the energy of falling or flowing water is called hydroelectricity
 san 2005 main vishwa bhar main lagbhag 816 gwe jalavidyut utpann kii jaati thi jo ki vishwa kii sampoorn vidyut urja kaa lagbhag 20% he
 This electricity is pollution free
 evam yah paryaavaran ke anukool he
 The economically exploitable and viable water potential in India is estimated at 84,000 MW at a 66 percent weight factor
 iske atirikt, chote, laghu tathaa sookshm jal vidyut yojanaon se sthapit kshamta ke 6780 megawatt kaa aankalan kiya gaya he
 56 sites have also been identified for pumped storage schemes with accumulated installed capacity of 94,000 MW
 tathaapi, abhi tak is sambhavyata ke keval 19
9 pratshit kaa hi dohan kiya ja sakaa he
 Electricity is the hydroelectric power obtained from water generated by water
 vidyut shakti ke janan kii vidhiyon main jalavidyut bahut mahatvapurn hai
 One-third of the entire electric power of the world is received in the form of hydroelectricity
 yon to kisi bhi rup main uplabdh urja ko vidyutshakti ke janan ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The energy contained in the water falling in the waterfall has been used since ancient times to run the watermill, but the use of this energy for electric power has been given from the twentieth century itself
 na keval girte hue jal main nihit urja kaa upyog shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, varan behate hue pani main nihit gatij urja kaa upyog bhi shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the first is to choose a place where the dam can be stored in plenty of water and the power contained therein can be used to generate electricity for power generation by using canals or open canals in power stations
 upyukt sthaan kii talash ke liye varsha tathaa jameen donon kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 The dam is built in such a place where the dam made in the lowest price can store maximum water
 iske liye sthaan kii prakritik dasha aisi honi chahie ki koi nadi ghati main hoti hui pahaado ke bich sankare maarg se guzarati ho, jisase sakare sthaan par band banaakar nadi ke upree bhaag ko ek bade jalashay main parivartit kiya ja sake
 Another agar is built above the dam, from where the water is carried by open canals or taps to the power house
 yah pani bijlighar main sthit bade bade tarabinon ko chalaata he, jinase yojit janitron main vidyut shakti kaa janan hota he
 The turbine is located on the face of the draft tube made of cement concrete
 pani guide wain main hota hua tarabine ke bladon ko ghumata he or is prakaar apane nihit urja kaa tarabine ke chalaane main upyog karata he
 The mechanical energy of the moving turbine is converted into electrical energy and thus the energy contained in water takes the form of hydroelectricity
 tarabine main is prakaar pani main nihit shakti kaa upyog ho jane ke pashchaat, pani draft-tub main se hota hua visarjani kulya main jaataa he, jahaan se vah phir nadi main ja miltaa he
 The design of the draft-tube is such that the remaining energy of the water is slowly depleted, so that it does not damage the river banks when it comes out
 pani main nihit urja, uske aaytan tathaa sheersh par nirbhar karti he
 Hydropower schemes can be divided into three parts according to the head: 1
 ucch sheersh yojana - lagbhag 200 meter se adhik
 2
 Medium Head Plan - 50 meters to 200 meters
 3
 nimna sheersh yojana - 50 meter se kam
 Both the size and the shape of the plan depends on the top and also the type of its turbines accordingly
 is prakaar ucch sheersh ke liye francis tarabine evam paston chakra upyukt hote hai
 Pressurized turbines are used for the middle head
 nimna sheersh ke liye nodak praroop kaa tarabine adhik upyukt hota he
 In high-end schemes, generally, the volume of water is not high
 isliye pani ko nalon dwaara le jaakar tarabine ke tund se ranor kii waltiyon par choda jaataa he, jisase pani main nihit urja ranor ko chalaane main samarth hoti he
 The turbine can control the output of the turbine by controlling the flow and speed of the water and by varying the angle of water released on the buckets and thus control the power generated
 baltiyon ke kone kaa vicharan karnaa bhi sambhav he or donon niyantranon ko swat: chaalit rup se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The propellant turbine runner has only three or four wings
 ye baari ispaat ke bane hote hai
 Low head plans often have a very high water volume
 at: inamen pani ko nalon main le janaa sambhav nahin hota or khuli naalee kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 To obtain the output corresponding to the load, it is necessary to vary the amount of water going into the turbine, which is edited by opening the door
 ye dwaar guide pichhafalak kii bhanti hote hai or inaki sthiti pani kaa niyantran karti he
 Being heavy, these gates are driven by hydraulic pressure
 jis prakaar peltan chakra ke guide pichhafalak, athwa baltiyon, ke kone kaa vicharan kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar inhen bhi swat: chaalit rup se pravartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The automatic driven variance is performed by the servo motor
 yah chota sa motor hota he, jo dravchaalit daabak kaa vicharan karata he
 Its investment is only a fraction of the output of the turbine, so it varies accordingly
 is prakaar is motor dwaara kiya gaya kaary tarabine ke nirgat par, jo uske upar bhaar ke anuroop hota he, nirbhar karata he or swat: chaalit rup se dravchaalit daabak ko gata badhaakar usee ke anusaar guide pichhafalak, athwa dwaara khulaai, kaa niyantran kar detaa he, athwa baltiyon ke kone kaa vyavasthaapan kar detaa he
 Propellant type turbine is the main one in propellant type turbine
 isaki visheshta isaki majboot or ucch dakshata he
 Another feature of this is that the load variance has very little effect on efficiency, due to which this turbine is very suitable for variable loads
 madhyam sheersh yojanaon main, saamanyat:, mishrit pravaahavala tarabine adhik prayukt hota he, parantu sheersh ke anuroop hi uskaa chayan adhik nirbhar karata he
 Steady guide lanes are used to move water to the turbine
 iske nirgat kaa vicharan unke kone ke vicharan se kiya jaataa he
 a low-heading turbine is usually located above the open shafts
 ye sarpil praroop ke aavaran se ghire hote hai, jisase pani ko ek samaan rup se guide pichhafalak dwaara le jaaya ja sake
 In high-powered turbines, this cover is made of metal
 tarabine kshaitij evam urdhwadhar donon prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 But in general, vertical is more used
 inamen bering vishisht prakaar kaa hota he, jise mashin par pratishthit parshv aghat bhi vahan karnaa hota he
 Hence these are called shock wearings
 vering tathaa duusare gatiman bhaagon kaa snehan bhi apane-aap main ek kathin samasya hoti he
 Pressure lubrication method is used for this
 isamen snehak tel ko dabaakar snehan kiye janevaale sthanon main bheja jaataa he
 Pressure is generated by the oil pump
 daab ghat jane par, mashin ke apane aap band ho jane kii vyavastha bhi hoti he, jisase aisi paristhiti main use kshati na pahunche
 There is an oil filter to clean the lubricating oil and there is also an oil cooler to cool the oil that gets heated after lubrication
 jalavidyut yojanaon main sabase adhik mahatv unki sthiti kaa he
 Their condition depends mainly on natural and physical causes
 mote taur par kisi jalavidyut yojana se 1,000 ghan foot prati second ke pravaah se 150 foot kaa sheersh uplabdh hone par lagbhag 10 megawatt kii shakti uplabdh hogi
 The reservoir can also be estimated on the basis that 1 foot of water over an area of 1
13 square miles generates a flow of only 1 cubic foot per second
 at: 1,000 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah paane ke liye jalashay main 113 varg mile ke kshetrafal main ausat se 10 foot gaharaa pani hona chahie
 For any hydroelectric scheme to be practical, it is necessary to have maximum head and flow
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen tabhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati hai, jab pani kaa pravaah paryaapt ho
 High-top schemes can be practical even at low flows
 bijlighar kii sthiti band ke nikat hona anivaary nahin he
 The reservoir can be on the mountain and the powerhouse can be built at the foot of the mountain to get to the top
 aisi dasha main pani kii badi badi nalikaaon dwaara bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Plans with higher heads are usually of this type
 bahut se sthanon par pahari ko katkar surang ke dwaara pani ko pahari ke duusari or bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 It is not compulsory for the power house to be on earth
 bahut se bijlighar prithvi ke andar bhi hote hai or us tak lift dwaara hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 a similar underground power plant has been built in Maithon
 aise bijli ghar swachaalit praroop ke haate hai or duurastha niyantran dwaara prithvital se chaalit hote hai
 Although these power plants are built mainly inside the earth due to natural reasons, they are very important from a strategic point of view
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen hamaare desh main bahut hai
 Many power stations have been built over the Ganges and Sharda canals, in which only the top of 20 to 30 feet is used
 ye yojanaayen pani kaa pravaah adhik hone ke kaaran vyaavhaarik ho saki hai
 Hydropower schemes are mainly in Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and USA
 bharat bhi jalavidyut yojanaon main bahut peeche nahin he or yahan kii kuch yojanaayen vishwa kii mahanatam yojanaon main gini jaati hai, jaise, bhakhra-nangal, damodar ghati, rihand, hyrakund, nagarjun sagar, koyna, shivasamudram, periyar aadi
 Many hydroelectric schemes are also multipurpose
 mukhyat: inke saath sinchai evam baadh rodhak yojanaayen bhi shaamil rahati hai, jisase kshetra kaa sarvangin vikaas kiya ja sake
 Damodar Valley Corporation was also established in India on the basis of Tennessee Valley Corporation in USA
 pichley bees varshon main bahut si mahatvapurn jalavidyut yojanaayen bani hai or sabhi jagah jalavidyut sambhaavnaaon kaa adhyayan kar yojanaayen banaai ja rahi hai
 In hydroelectric planning, although there is a lot of expenditure initially, most of the schemes are successful from the economic point of view due to lower operating expenses
 inke sanyatra kaa jivan bhi apekshaakrit bahut adhik hota he
 Their main drawback is actually their distance from consumer locations
 ye yojanaayen jahaan chahen vahaan ke liye nahin banaai ja saktin
 For example, if the demand for power is in Calcutta, it is not possible to implement the hydroelectric scheme there
 himalay se nikalanevaali nadiyon main apaar jalashakti nihit he, parantu vahaan shakti kii maang nahin he
 In this way, the power generated by the hydroelectric scheme often has to be transmitted to great distances
 at:, jalavidyut yojana kaa saapeksh rup se adhyayan karne ke liye preshnatantr kaa vyay bhi lagaana aavashyak he
 Even then, hydroelectricity is mostly cheap
 yah hindu dharm ke prasiddh parvatiy tirthon main se ek he
 It is located at the confluence of Prayag Dhauli Ganga and Alaknanda rivers, Vishnuprayag
 sangam par bhagwaan vishnu ji pratimaa se sushobhit pracheen mandir or vishnu kund darshneey hai
 It is situated at an altitude of 1372 m above sea level
 vishnu prayag joshimath-badrinaath motor maarg par sthit he
 Social ownership refers to various forms of ownership for means of production in socialist economic systems; This includes public ownership, employee ownership, cooperative ownership, civil ownership of equity, and common ownership
 panchaloh yaa panchadhaatu ek mishratu he jiskaa upyog hindu or jain pratimaaon ke nirmaan main kiya jaataa he
 It is traditionally considered sacred
 lambe samay tak panchaloh murtiyon kaa nirmaan ek gupt rahasy bana rahaa
 Panchadhatu is a mixture of gold, copper, silver, brass and lead or gypsum
 Since ancient times, the trend of idols made of Panchadhatu has been running
 In the Mahabharata period, Lord Krishna gave a shield to Arjuna which was made of a panchadhatu
 Fear of the mind or lack of self-confidence can be overcome by wearing the ring of Panchadhatu
 Everybody has to become successful, everyone has to achieve the point who wants to reach there
