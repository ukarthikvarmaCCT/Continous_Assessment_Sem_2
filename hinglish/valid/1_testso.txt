 The film was successful at the box office upalambh kavy kaa vivaran According to ancient Sanskrit Hindi poetry, Upalambha poetry is mainly a distinction of Shringarakavya, in which the trusted friend of the heroine gives the epithet to the hero to the hero
 lekin sarvatra sakhi dwaara hi nayika nayak ko upalanbhpurn sandesh nahin detii, balki sanyog shringaar main nayika swayan hi nayak ko upalambh detii he
 Sometimes the heroine, bird, cloud or wind also sends the protagonist to the corner

 There is no reproach or condemnation of the beloved; Its main sense is, somehow the feeling or effort of dear companionship, collaborative ambivalence and desire for union
 paribhaasha ke isi vaishishty ke kaaran upalambh kavy keval shringaar tak hi simit nahin mana ja saktaa
 In Hindi Bhaktikavya the Upalambha is found in sufficient quantity

 buddha kaa vaastavik naam siddharth tha
 He was born in Lumbini near Kapilavastu
 isi sthaan par, teesri shatabdi isa purv main samraat ashok ne buddha kii smriti main ek stambh banaaya tha
 Siddhartha's father was Shuddhodana, the king of the Shakyas
 paramparaagat katha ke anusaar, siddharth kii mata mahamaya unke janm ke kuch der baad mar gayi thi
 It is said that 8 sages were invited to name him, all told 2 possibilities, they will become a great king, they will become a monk or parivrajaka
 is bhavishya vaani ko sunakar raja shuddhodan ne apni yogyata kii had tak siddharth ko sadhu na banane dene kii bahut koshishen kii
 The Shakyas had their own union
 bees varsh kii aayu hone par har shakya tarun ko shakyasang main dikshit hokar sangh kaa sadsy bananaa hota tha
 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa
 He opted for the third option and agreed to leave the country as a transcendent
 parivrajak banakar sarvapratham siddharth ne paanch brahmanon ke saath apane prashnon ke uttar dhundne shuru kiye
 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions
 fir unhone tapasya karne kii koshish kii
 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat
 ve ek pipal ke ped ke neeche baith gayi pratigya karke ki ve satya jane bina uthenge nahin
 At the age of 35, he attained Bodhi and became a Buddha
 unka pahila dharmopadesh varanasi ke paas sarnath me tha
 For the rest of his 45 years, Gautama Buddha gave his sermon around the river Ganges, to both the rich and the poor
 unhone do sanyaasiyon ke sangh kii bhi sthapana jinhone buddha ke dharmopadesh ko failaana jari rakhaa
 Tripitaka is the main text of Buddhism

 Cinic is a Greek philosophy sect, famous for its neglect of society and prohibitive view of individual life
 is sampradaay kaa sansthaapak antistheneez tha
 At first he was a sophist
 baad main sucraat ke swatantra vichaaron, parahitchintan tathaa aatmatyag se prabhavit hokar, vah use apana guru maanane laga
 When the Greek democracy condemned Socrates to death, Antisthenes was unwilling to reconsider the justification of the sovereignty of society over the individual to punish a self-styled man like Socrates
 apane uddeshy kii purti ke liye, usne "prakruti kii ore chalo" kaa naaraa lagaaya
 Pointed to the natural life in which every human being was a master of himself
 koi kisi kaa das na tha
 To adopt that life, there was a need to be detached from wealth, honor, etc
 antistheneez ne ise saharsha sweekaar kiya
 But, in supporting this type of life, he did not want to let the meaning of education, rituals, accretion etc
 disappear
 isliye, usase maanviya jivan kii abhivruddhi kii naitik vyakhya kii
 He was influenced by Socrates
 sucraat ne gyaan or naitik aacharan main kaaran-kaary-sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Reiterating these Socratic ideals, Antisthenes tried to show that the re-enactment of auspiciousness is an expression of wisdom, not blindly following blind lines
 budhimaan vyakti samaaj ke adhikansh vyaktiyon dwaara sweekrut ayukt moolyankan ko samay-samay par thik karata rahata he
 a variety of Antisthenes had also prepared a theoretical bench to support their views
 aflatoon ne "saamaanya' kii nirpeksh satta kaa samarthan kiya tha or vyakti ke satya ko "saamaanya' kaa bhaag bataaya tha
 Antisthenes opposed this philosophy of Aflatun
 usne yah dikhaaya ki "saamaanya' kii koi swatantra satta nahin
 An element is considered "normal" due to its prevalence among many individuals
 vyaktiyon se pruthak uskaa koi astitv nahin
 Thus, against the generalism of Aflatun, Antisthenes established "nomadism"
 yahan tak usne "gunkathak par nirbhar paribhaasha' kaa khandan kiya
 He often considered the object to be a specific object or person
 vyakti nirnay vaakyon ke uddeshy banate hai
 Definition is also a type of decision sentence
 kintu, saamaanya gun kisi vishisht vastu kaa vighan nahin ho saktaa
 On this theoretical pedestal, Antisthenes started the individualist philosophy according to which a wise man can be a critic, not a member of society
 antistheneez ke vichaaron ko aage badhaane kaa shrey uske shiro dioginis ko diya jaataa he
 He used to say, "I am a dog barking at the evils of society; my job is to set the proper values in the prevailing values" With these, the Sinic sect did not end
 unki parampara unani darshan ke ant tak chalati rahi
 Sinic was not anti-social
 unke vichaar se samaaj ko uchit maarg par chalaane ke liye kuch sachet tathaa nishpaksh samikshakon kii aavashyaktaa thi, jo sweekrut mulyon main samay-samay par sanshodhan karte rahen
 But, for such critics, he understood the need for detachment and isolation from society, along with intellectual development and moral conduct
 apana kaary uchit rup se kar sakane ke liye, sinic darshanikon ne vishesh prakaar kaa rahan-sahan apanaaya tha
 They did not understand the need for good homes, tasty food and pleasant clothes
 kaha jaataa he, dioginis ne kisi puraani naand main apana jivan vyateet kiya
 That was his house
 sucraat ke liye kaha jaataa he ki usne kabhi juute nahin pahane; sardi, garmi ke anusaar apane vastron main parivartan nahin kiya
 But he used to roam in the city of Athens, criticizing the wrongdoers
 is kaam main vyast rahane se vah kabhi apane paitrik vyavsaay main ruchi na le sakaa
 The Cynics received education from the life of Sukuret
 ve samajhate the ki apni samasyaon kaa niraakaran karke hi samaaj kii chaukasee kii ja sakati he
 The Cynics aimed to interest society; However, the way he used to express his viewpoint, he seemed grossly individualistic and cynical of the society
 sinic aadarshon kaa sampradaay ke rup main samuchit nirvaah adhik samay tak sambhav na tha
 According to the last Cynic circumstances, Cynic began to accept the ideals in living
 uttaradhikariyon ke liye praarambhik upadeshtaon kii bhanti virakt evam aatmatyagi hona sambhav na tha
 Therefore, over time, the general meaning of Cynic became a person who neglected society
 kintu maanviya chintan se sinic tatv kaa sarvatha abhaav na ho sakaa
 From time to time, there have been the benefactors of such a society, who have been angry with the misconceptions of the society, have expressed a sense of alienation and have been making commentaries that indicate the proper path
 swargeey barnard sha ko beesvin sadi kaa bahut bada sinic kaha ja saktaa he
 The social criticism pervaded in his literature often reaches the surface of neglect, but we cannot reach the meaning of "cynic" without seeking the social interest inherent in that neglect

 | a Dental Thermometer]] tapamapi yaa tharmametre vah yukti he jo taap yaa 'taap kii pravanta' ko maapne ke kaam aati he
 'thermometry' is the name of the branch of physics in which the methods of thermometry are considered
 tapamapi anek siddhanton ke aadhaar par nirmit kiye ja sakate hai
 The volume of liquids increases by consuming heat and this increase in volume is proportional to temperature
 saadhaaran tharmametre isi siddhanth par kaam karte hai
 To determine the unit of temperature, a substance is placed in two fixed thermal equilibria respectively
 inako niyat bindu kehete hai
 In these states, the magnitudes of a particular property of the substance are removed and their differences are divided equally over a certain number
 inamen se prayek ansh tapamaapan kii ikai maani jaati he, jisko ek ansh athwa degree kehete hai
 For long time, the thermometer and the steam point have been used in thermometers as fixed points
 jis taap par shuddh barf or shuddh vayusantrupt pani ek vayumandal ke daab par saath saath samyavastha main rahete hai usko himbindu kehete hai
 Similarly, the equilibrium of pure water and pure steam at a certain pressure is called the steam point
 saamaanya tharmamitaron main shishe kii ek choti khokhli ghundi hoti he, jisamen paara yaa drav bharaa rahata he
 Due to thermal diffusion, fluid enters the tube
 urpyukt donon niyat binduon par nalee main drav ke tal ke saamne chihn laga die jate hai
 In the centigrade scale, now called the Celcius scale, the icepoint is assumed to be zero and the point to 100 degrees
 in donon chinhon ke bich kii duuri ko 100 sam bhaagon main baant diya jaataa he
 In the Fahrenheit scale, both these points are considered to be 32 and 212 degrees respectively and their difference is divided into 180 parts
 uparyukt tapamapiyon main tapakram tapiya prasaaran par aadhaarit he, kintu aisa aavashyak nahin
 Any property, which grows uniformly according to the temperature, can be used for this purpose
 vastav main prayogshaala ke anek sugrahi tapamapi vidyutpratirodh ke parivartan yaa tapavidyut par aadhaarit hote hai
 Like properties, there is no restriction on liquids
 koi bhi padaarth tapamapi main prayukt kiya ja saktaa he, kintu mukhya samasya yah he ki padaartho or gunon ke bhed se jo vibhinn tapamapi nirmit ho sakate hai unase donon niyat binduon ko chhodkar anya sab tapon par paathyaankon main bhed milegaa
 This proves that all these can not be considered basically authentic
 siddhanthata ushmagatiki par aadhaarit maapcrap swat:pramaan mana jaataa he or duusare paimaane uske anusaar shuddh kar liye jate hai
 In this science, an engine is conceived that takes heat from a furnace and converts part of it into work with maximum efficiency, and gives the remaining part to a low-temperature condenser
 isko carno ingine, athwa prativarti izn, kehete hai
 According to the theory, if several different thermal pairs of the furnace and condenser are assembled and a Carno engine is fitted between each, then the work done by it is proportional to the temperature difference of these pairs
 is prakaar kaary ke maapan se tapantar gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The efficiency of this engine does not depend on the amount of liquid in its cylinder and its state, hence it is considered as the basis of temperature and the temperature determined by it is called paramatap
 centegrade or fahrenheit paimaane kii tarah paramtaap mapkram kaa shunya manamaana nahin hota
 The work done by the Carno engine depends on the temperature of both the furnace and the condenser
 sanghnitr kii tapiya avasthaa aisi bhi ho sakati he ki yah ingine bhatthi se praapt samast ooshmaa ko kaary main badal de or sanghnitr ko uskaa koi bhi ansh praapt na ho
 In such a situation, the temperature of the condenser is considered zero
 degree kaa pariman nirdhaaran karne ke liye pehle kii tarah do niyat binduon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Before 1954, snow and steam points were also used in the paramatap scale
 in donon ke tapabhed ko 100° param mana jaataa tha
 This means that the centenary work of the work obtained by placing the Carne engine furnace on the steampoint and the condenser on the icepoint exhibits a degree of work
 is prabandh main badi kathinaayee yah padati he ki himbindu kii yatharthata simit he or bhinn vaigyanikon dwaara praapt raashimaanon main ± 01° paa tak kaa antar paaya jaataa he
 To avoid this, only one fixed point has been used since 1954 as per international determination
 trikbindu us taap ko kehete hai jisapar pani, barf or jalawaashp kaa samya sambhav he
 Its value has been voluntarily assumed to be 273
16 ° Pa
 aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki san 1954 se purv paramtaap paimaana teen binduon, dwaara nirghaarit hota tha, kintu ab keval do binduon kaa upyog hota he
 In other words, one of the two fixed points mentioned at the beginning of this article is Paramashuni and the other is Trikbindu
 trikbindu or paramashunya ke bich kaary karanevaale carno ingine dwaara jo kaary hota he uskaa 1 / 273
16 ansh kaary ek param degree kaa bodh karata he
 The engine of Carno is ideal and in practice its construction is not possible, but it can be proved that the thermometer's readings produced by the thermal diffusion of the ideal gas are equal to the permittivity
 at: adarsh gas paimaana swat: pramaan, athwa praathmik maanak, mana jaataa he
 An ideal gas is a gas that follows the following law: jisamen daab, aaytan tathaa paramataap hote he
 Is a constant whose value is the same for a gram-molecule quantity of each ideal gas
 gas tharmametre do prakaar ke hote hai, ek to sthir aaytan vaale or duusare sthir daab vaale
 The earlier action is simple and its errors can be corrected reliably
 at: sthir aaytan tapamapiyon kaa hi upyog hota he
 As the name suggests, pressure is measured by keeping the volume of the gas constant
 adarsh gas tapamapi se taap nikaalane main athak parishram or samay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is possible to have errors in the text due to many reasons and the result obtained for them has to be amended
 kuch trutiyaan to tapamapi kii banaavat main uchit parivartan karke dur kii jaati hai or kuch ke liye lambii gananaa kerani hoti he
 From this it is proved that gas thermometer may not be suitable for daily work in the laboratory
 isaliye antarrashtriya nishchay ke anusaar kuch padaarthon ke galnaank or kvathanank praathmik maanak ke rup main prayukt hote hen
 These scores have been properly measured after much diligence from the ideal gas scale and their values have gained international acceptance

 Just as heat increases the length of materials, similarly the resistance of metal wires also increases by heat
 tapiya prasaran kii tarah is vaddhi kaa bhi tapamaapan main upyog ho saktaa he
 Many metal wires are used for this work
 phir bhi platinum taar ke bane tapamapi kaa mahatv isaliye adhik hota he kyonki vah antarrashtriya paimaane ke antarveshan ke liye prayukt hota he
 The wire must be pure metal and deformation free

 Several types of electrodes are used for resistivity
 inamen calendar-griffith kaa sethu purana or sarvavidit he
 It is based on the principle of Wheatstone Bridge
 pratiroshmapan ke platinum taar ko jin vaahak taron se sanyukt kiya jaataa he ve bhi ooshmaa se garm ho jate hai, jisase unke pratirodh main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 This change is also measured by the bridge and becomes the cause of inaccuracy in the calculation of heat
 calendar griffith sethu se is truti ko dur karne ke liye thik isi prakaar ke vaahak taar sethu kii sanyugmi bhujaa main bhi daal die jate hai
 Both pairs live close by in the thermometer and have a similar heat effect
 is kaaran sethu ke santulan or maapit pratirodh par inkaa koi asar nahin hota
 Another way to correct this error is to measure the difference between the ends of the platinum wire by not removing its resistance
 taar ke andar nishchit maatra main vidyudhara kaa pravaah kiya jaataa he
 Differential measurements are taken by connecting its two ends with a potentiometer
 pratirodh ke samaanupati hone ke kaaran vibhavantar se om ke niyamanusaar pratirodh kii gananaa kar lee jaati he
 In these, the effect of resistance of the carrier wires is completely lost
 yadi do bhinn dhaatuon ke taar ek paripath main sanyukt hon or unke sangambinduon ko bhinn taap par rakhaa jaay to paripath main vidyut dhara kaa pravaah hane lagata he
 This current can be seen in the circuit by the sensing capacitor
 dhara ke utpaadak bal, arthath vidyudvahak bal kaa maan k or kha ke tapantar par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, it can be measured by measuring temperature
 aise taar ke jodon ko tapantar yugma kehete hai
 The metals of the heating pairs used in the international scale are described above, but various metals are used in the laboratory keeping in mind the requirements of sensitivity and use
 tapantar yugma main vi0 vaa0 ba0 tapantar par nirbhar hota he, isaliye nimna tapawale sangam kaa taap sthir rakhaa jaataa he
 EMF is measured by combining the ends a and b with a potentiometer or millivoltmometer
 milivoltmapi main yah sidhaa maapit hota he, parantu yah utana sugrahi nahin he jitna vibhavamaapi
 When a solid object is heated, it radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves
 kam tapavriddhi hone par tarangon kaa tarangadairghy kam hota he or unase ooshmaa kaa anubhav hota hai
 At higher temperatures, there is an excess of waves with shorter wavelengths, which reflect light
 vikeern urja kii maatra or uske gun garm vastu kii avasthaa par bhi nirbhar karte hai
 a completely black object has the property that it exploits all the radiated energy on it and automatically radiates maximum energy
 aisi vastu ko krishna vastu athwa krishnaka bhi kehete hai
 If the walls of a closed hollow body are placed on the stratosphere, then the radiated energy produced within it is completely similar in properties and quantity to black body radiation
 at: prayogshaala main krishnika ke liye aise hi khokhale bartan kaa upyog karte hai
 It is necessary to make a small hole in it, so that energy can come out from within and it is possible to study its properties
 ucchtam taapmaana ke liye krishnika kaa upyog karte hai
 There are two types of thermometers based on it
 ek main purna vikiran kii maatra kaa paapan kiya jaataa he
 This is called full radiation thermometer
 duusaren prakaar main vikiran ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte hai
 These are called optical thermometer
 in uttapamapiyon main yah gun hota he ki inamen tapamapi ko garm padaarth se sanlagn rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or inase unchaa taap maapit ho saktaa he
 But the drawback of these is that in principle only the temperature of the black body is possible
 anya vastuon kaa taap vaastavik taap se kam milegaa, jiske liye sanshodhan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is based on Stephen's law
 is niyam ke anusaar kisi krishnika dwaara vikeern urja, param taap ke chauthe ghaat kii samaanupati hoti he, arthath Is a constant
 tapamaapan ke liye ucchatapiya vastu kaa vikiran kisi lens athwa darpan se tapantar yugma ke ek sire par focus kar dete he usase urja oogyaat ho jaati he
 If the constants are known, heat can be calculated by the above equation
 vastav main anek trutiyon ke kaaran taap kaa ghaat 4 se thodaa bhinn hota he
 So in practice let's use the equation given below: isamen or sthiraank hai
 b must be 4 according to Stephen's rule, but here it is considered unknown
 ucchatapiya krishnika kaa taap or tapantar yugma ko taap he
 a and b is assumed by placing the thermometer in front of black bodies of certain temperatures
 yantra main vikiran ke focusikaran kaa aisa prabandh rahata he ki usase maapit taap ucchatapiya vastu kii duuri par nirbhar nahin karata
 If the object is not completely Krishna then amendment is done for this inaccuracy
 inamen krishnika se praapt vikiran ke varnakram kaa sookshm ansh, jiskaa tarangadairghy lagbhag ek hota he, chhant liya jaataa he or isaki tivrata kii tulana ek maanak lamp kii vikiran tivrata se kii jaati he
 If the radiation intensity of the black body at the altitude for the wavelength is its intensity, then according to Planck's rules ek sthiraank hota he jiskaa maan plank siddhant dwaara nishchit he
 If E1, E2 and T1 are known, then T2 becomes known
 adrishy tantu attapamapiyon main maanak batti kii vikirantivrata main is prakaar parivartan karte hai ki uski tivrata maapi janevaali vikeern urja kii tivrata ke baraabar ho jaae

 Where special precision is required, its reading has to be amended for many errors
 inamen sabase mukhya truti yah hoti he ki shunya chinh badalata rahata he
 This happens for two reasons
 tapamapi jab banaaya jaataa he uske bahut samay pashchaat tak uskaa sheesha sikudta rahata he, jisase shunya chinh badalata rahata he
 Secondly, whenever the temperature of a hot object is measured, the glass takes a long time to return to its normal state
