 Important uses of electronic devices are: aajkal ke kai atiprachlit yantra bhi bina electraniki ke ban nahin pate, jaise radio, doordarshan, chalchitr, pratidipti prakaash, jan-vyaakhyaan-pranali, telephone aadi
 All these tips are the result of electronics
 electraniki ke kuch audyogic upyogon ke vishay main sankshep main neeche likh ja rahaa he : Inductors are often used in industries, by which the alternating current is converted into a specified current
 ve praaia: nimnlikhit main se ek prakaar ke hote hai : The use of multicomponent circuitous circuits in high power compensation is more profitable for several reasons than neglecting the use of single circuitry circuits
 pratham kaaran yah he ki aajkal vidyutiya shakti kaa utpaadan tathaa vitaran tri-kala-shakti ke rup main hota he
 The second reason is that the voltage generated by the polynomial bifurcation is more even than the voltage produced by the single bifurcation

 Industrial Uses of High Frequency Heating - Extremely powerful high frequency generators are being used a lot in heating by cross electrification and motivation
 jab kisi parvidyut ko sandharitra ke do patton ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or sandharitra ko ek shaktishaalee ucch aavriti utpaadak se sambhddha kar diya jaataa he, to ek hanidhara ke kaaran parvidyut kaa taap bad jaataa he or hawa pighalane lagata he
 This type of rule is also for heating by inspiration
 ye yuktiyaan saadhaaran garam karne kii apeksha adhik laabhadaayak hai
 Electricity is used a lot in the industry to heat objects
 is vidhi se kaary bahut svachh hota he tathaa khuli hui jwaala upasthit nahin rahati

 Wrap a coil around the piece of metal to be heated and alternating current in it
 vidyut-pravaah se utpann chumbakeey syand vaayu main se tathaa kundali ke sameep upasthit dhaatu main se bhi hokar jaataa he
 The reversal of the current also changes the wind, which causes the voltage in the metal to be induced
 is voltata ke kaaran dhaatu main adhik maatra main bhanvar dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he
 The heat is then generated due to the resistance of the metal
 vidyut se achaalak padaarthon ko tapt karne ke liye 1,000 kilocycle yaa 1 megacicle se adhik aavriti kii shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since current cannot flow through the object, the object is placed between high-voltage metal plates
 vidyut kshetra ke teevr parivartan ke kaaran achaalak vastu kii anu-saranchana main bhi vaise hi parivartan hone lagate hai
 Due to friction between molecules, the same temperature is produced everywhere in the object
 is vidhi se achaalak vastuon kii moti chaadaron ko bahut thode samay main tapt kiya ja saktaa he
 They can be compacted by moving high currents in two pieces of metal, ie, the machine has a capacitance converter, which converts 1 to 10 voltmeters from between two electrical currents of 220 or 440 volts
 And at the same time gives high electrification

 According to the Act, a company means a company which has been established and registered under this Act
 sanyukt poonji company vidhaan dwaara nirmit aisa 'kritrim vyakti' he jiskaa swatantra vaidhanik astitv hota he, iskaa shaashvat jivan tathaa ek saarvamudra hoti he
 The company's capital is divided into equal-value shares
 company ke sadasyon, jinke paas ek yaa usase adhik ansh hon, company ke anshadharak kehalaate hai
 The corporate form of business organizations enjoys many advantages over other formats, some of them being the following: bade vyavsaayon ke liye sanghathan kaa company swaroop upyukt he
 This makes it possible to collect large amounts of capital for large scale operations
 mashin nirmaan, soochna praudyogiki, louh evam ispaat, aluminium, urvarak tathaa aushadhi udyog aadi sanyukt poonji company ke swaroop main sangathit kiye jate hai

 rashtriya simaaon ke paar bade paimaane par utpaadan tathaa vitaran ke kaaran bahurashtriya companiyon ko adhik kamai hoti he
 Due to which they get many benefits
 uparokt laabhon par charchaa se ek baat to tay he ki ye bahurashtriya companiyaan jis desh main sthapit hoti hai us desh ko nihsandeh laabh pahunchataa he
 But multinationals have some limitations, which are as follows: vyavastha chitra yaa 'schimatic chitra' aisa chitra he jo kisi tantra ko amoort graphic sanketon ke madhyam se chitrit karata he

 Artificial kidneys were first developed by Abel, Rontre, and Turner in 1913, by the first hemodialysis Haas on humans, and by artificial development of artificial kidneys as a useful tool in 1943–1945
 is shodh se darshaya gaya ki vrikk vifaltaa se mar rahe rogiyon ke jivan ko lanbaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Dr
 Willem Kolff was the first person who produced a functional dialyzer in 1943
 jis rogi kaa sabase pehle safaltaapurvak ilaaj kiya gaya vah uramic coma main ek 67 varshiya mahila thi jise kolf ke apohak dwaara 11 ghanton ke hemodialysis ke baad hosh aa gaya tha
 At the time of its creation, Kolff aimed to provide life support while recovering from acute renal failure
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samaapt hone ke baad, kolf ne apane banaae hue paanch apohak ko vishwa ke vibhinn aspataalon ko daan kar diya, jisamen shaamil tha mount sinai hospital, new york
 kolf ne apni hemodialysis mashin ke khaake ko boston main peter bent brigham hospital main jorge thorn ko diya
 This led to the creation of the next generation of Kolff's dialyzer, a stainless steel kolff-brigham dialysis machine
 1950 ke dashak tak, wilem kolf ke apohak ke avishkaar kaa istemaal gambhir vrikk vifaltaa ke liye kiya jaataa tha, lekin ise stage 5 jeern vrikk rog vaale rogiyon ke liye ek vyavhaarya upachaar ke rup main nahin dekha gaya
 At that time, doctors believed that it was impossible for patients to undergo dialysis indefinitely for two reasons
 sabase pehle, unhone sochaa ki koi bhi maanav nirmit upkaran lambey samay tak gurde kii kriyaaon ko pratisthapit nahin kar saktaa he
 Additionally, the veins and arteries of a patient undergoing dialysis were damaged, making it difficult to find an artery to access the patient's blood, after several treatments

 Dr
 Nils Alwal introduced a modified version of this kidney inside a stainless steel canister, over which a negative pressure could be exerted and thus effected the truly real practical application of hemodialysis, which was done in 1946 at Lund University it was done
 alvaal yakeenan, dialysis ke liye dhamnishiraparak shant ke avishkaarak the
 He first reported it in 1948 where he used such arteriovenous shunts in rabbits
 baad main unhone kaanch ke bane aise shant or saath hi saath apane canstar-band apohak kaa istemaal 1946 or 1960 ke bich vrikk vifaltaa vaale 1,500 rogiyon kaa ilaaj karne ke liye kiya, jaisaa ki unhone sitambar 1960 main avian main yojit pratham antarrashtriya nefrology congress ko bataaya
 Alwal was appointed to a newly created post of nephrology at Lund University in 1957
 iske baad unhone swedish vyapaaree holgar krafurd ke saath sahyog se ek pramukh company kaa gathan kiya jisane baad main pichley 50 saalon main dialysis upkaran, gambro kaa nirmaan kiya
 The initial history of dialysis has been reviewed by Stanley Sheldon
 dow belding ech
 scribnar ne ek sarjan, da
 wain quinton ke saath kaam karte hue alvaal dwaara prayukt kaanch ke shant ko sanshodhit kiya or use teflone se banaaya
 Another significant improvement was to attach them to a small piece of silicone elastomer tubing
 This formed the basis of the so-called Scribner shunt, perhaps more appropriately called the Quinton – Scribner shunt
 upachaar ke baad, you-aakaar ke chote teflone tub ke istemaal se sharir ke baahar donon tub ko jodate hue raktavahi abhigam ko khulaa rakhaa jayega, jo tub ke rakt ko dhamni main roak degaa or waapas tub se shiraaon main jaayegaa
 In 1962, Scribner launched the world's first outpatient dialysis facility, the Seattle Artificial Kidney Center, later renamed the Northwest Kidney Center
 turant yah samasya utpann hui ki kise dialysis diya janaa chahie, kyonki centre kii chah dialysis mashiinon kii kshamta kii tulana main maang kaaphi zyada bad gai
 Scribner decided that who would be given dialysis and who would not be given this decision, he would not take it
 Instead, it will be elected by an anonymous committee, which can be considered one of the first bioethic committees

 Generally, the larger the body size of a person, the greater the need for dialysis

 a twice-a-week session is suitable for patients in whom the majority of the kidney is functioning
 prati saptaah chaar satron ko aksar bade rogiyon ke liye nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he, saath hi un rogiyon ke liye jinamein drav adhibhaar kii samasya he
 Finally, there is now increasing interest in domestic short sessions of hemodialysis, which are 1
5–4-hour sessions given 5-7 times per week, usually at home
 There has also been increased interest in night dialysis, in which a patient undergoes dialysis, usually at home, 8–10 hours per night, 3–6 nights per week
 Nocturnal in-center dialysis is offered 3-4 times per week in the US in a few dialysis units

 Side effects caused by draining fluid too much and / or draining too quickly include low blood pressure, fatigue, chest pain, leg cramps, nausea and headaches
 These symptoms can be found during treatment and persist until after treatment, sometimes referred to collectively as dialysis hangovers or dialysis washouts

 Because hemodialysis requires the vascular system, the circulatory system of patients undergoing hemodialysis may be open to germs, which can lead to germs, an infection that affects the heart valve or an infection that affects the bones

 Heparin is the most commonly used anticoagulant in hemodialysis, as it is generally well tolerated and can be reversed immediately with protamine sulfate
 heparin allergy kabhi-kabhi ek samasya ho sakati he or nune platelet gananaa ko prerit kar sakati he
 In such patients, alternative anticoagulants may be used

 yah kritrim gurde main avshisht visankramak ke kaaran yaa swayan jhilli kii saamagree kii vajah se ho saktaa he
 In recent years, the use of gamma radiation, steam sterilization, or electron beam radiation instead of chemical disinfectants and the development of semi-permeable membranes with high biocompatibility has reduced the occurrence of first-use symptoms
 prasanskaran ke nae tareekon ko jo dialysis ke purv ke sweekaarya ghatak hai, un par hameshaa gaur kiya janaa chahie
 For example, in 2008, the first use type or reactions, including the death of a patient with heparin infection during the manufacturing process of highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate

 Specific complications associated with various types of hemodialysis are listed below
 hemodialysis main, rakt tak pahunchane ke liye teen praathmik tareekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he: ek antahshira catheter, ek dhamnishiraparak nalwran or ek synthetic grapht
 abhigam kaa prakaar kuch karkon dwaara prabhavit hota he jaise rogi ke gurde kii vifaltaa kaa ek apekshit samay or uske vahika pranali kii haalat
 rogiyon main ekaadhik abhigam ho saktaa he, kyonki aam taur par ek avi nalwran yaa grapht paripakv ho rahaa he or ek catheter kaa abhi bhi prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 Surgery is required in the creation of these three major types of vascular access
 catheter kaa upyog, jise kabhi-kabhi sivisi kaha jaataa he, do lumina vaale ek plastic catheter se bani hoti he jise ek vishaal nas main daalaa jaataa he taaki rakt kii badi maatra ko ek lumina se nikaala ja sake or use dialysis circuit main pravesh karaayaa ja sake or anya lumina ke madhyam se lautaaya ja sake
 However, blood flow is almost always less than that of a well-functioning fistula or graft
 catheter aamtaur par do saamaanya kismon main paae jate hai, nalika vaale or gaiyr nalika vaale
 Non-tubular catheter accessions are for short-term access, and the catheter emerges from the skin at the site of penetration into the vein
 nalika yukt catheter abhigam main ek lanbaa catheter shaamil hota he, jise nas main pravishti bindu se ek nikaas sthaan ke liye twachaa ke andar daalaa jaataa he
 It is usually inserted into the internal cervical vein in the throat and the exit site is usually in the chest
 yah nalika hamalaa karne vaale rogaanuon ke liye ek baadha ke rup main kaary karti he or vaise nalika catheter ko laghu se lekar madhyam avadhi ke upyog ke liye dizine kiya jaataa he kyonki sankraman abhi bhi ek samasya hoti he
 In addition to infection, venous contractions are another serious problem with catheter access
 catheter, nas main ek bahya padaarth he or aksar shira kii diwaar par daahak pratikriya utpann karata he
 This leads to scarring and contraction of the artery, which also leads to vascular obstruction
 isse shira dwaara shushk kshetra main gambhir shiraparak avrodh kii samasyaon kaa srijan ho saktaa he or shiraaon par bhi iskaa prabhaav pad saktaa he, jo baad ke samay nalwran yaa grapht ke nirmaan ke liye bekaar ho saktaa he
 If a long-term hemodialysis patient actually has a 'lack of access', it can be a fatal problem
 catheter abhigam kaa upyog aam taur par twarit dialysis ke liye sheeghra abhigam kii khatir kiya jaataa he, un rogiyon main nalika abhigam ke liye jinhen gambhir vrikk vifaltaa se ubarne kii sambhaavna he or un rogiyon ke liye jo vrikk vifaltaa ke antim charan main hai or jo yaa to vaikalpik abhigam kii pratiksha kar rahe hai yaa jo vaikalpik abhigam praapt karne main asamarth hai
 Catheter access is often popular in patients, because needles are not required for contact with a dialysis machine
 haalanki, upar ullikhit catheter abhigam kaa gambhir jokhim kaa matlab he ki is tarah ke abhigam par keval sabase hataash sthiti main ek dirghakaalik samaadhaan ke rup main hi vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 AV nalpravana is recognized as the preferred access method
 ek nalwran banane ke liye, ek sanvahani sarjan sammilan ke madhyam se ek dhamni or ek nas ko jodate hai
 As it escapes the capillaries, blood flows rapidly through the fistula
 ek vyakti apni ungali ko ek paripakv nalwran par rakhkar ise mahasoos kar saktaa hoon
 ise 'romaanch' kaa anubhav kehete hai or nalwran ke upar ek vishisht 'gunj' ehsaas ko paidaa karata he
 The "whisper" of blood passing through the fistula can be heard through a stethoscope, a sound called brute in English
 nalpravan aamtaur par gaiyr-prabhavi baanh main nirmit hota he or haath par sthit ho saktaa he, yaa baaju par yaa kohni main 
 ek nalwran ko paripakv hone main kai saptaah laga sakate hai, ek ausat se 4-6 saptaah
 upachaar ke dauraan, do suiyon ko nalwran main daalaa jaataa he, ek khun nikaalane ke liye or ek waapas daalane ke liye
 AV The advantages of fistula use include low infection rates, as no foreign substances are involved in their formation, high blood flow rates, and low incidence of thrombosis
 Complications are few, but if a fistula has a very high blood flow and the blood vessel that supplies it to the rest of the organs is impaired, a evasion symptom may arise where the blood entering the organ is pulled into the fistula and the organ
 k returns to normal transmission without entering the capillary
 isse us ang kii thand bhare charam lakshan paidaa hote hai, anthan dard or, gambhir utak haani hoti he
 a long-term complication of AV fistula may be that the aneurysm develops, a bulge on the vein wall where it may be weakened by repeated insertion of the needle
 ek badi seemaa tak dhamneevisphar viksit hone kaa khatra sui chubhaane kii surakshapurna takanic dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Aneurysm may necessitate corrective surgery and shorten the useful life of a fistula
 nalwran or dhamneevisphar kii kshati ko yaa chhadam-dhamneevisphar ke gathan ko rokane ke liye, yah anushansit he ki sui ko vibhinn binduon par kramvaar daalaa janaa chahie
 Another approach is to enter the fistula by a blunt needle, at the same place
 This is called the 'buttonhole' approach
 ek die gaye nalwran par aksar do yaa teen batanhole sthaan uplabdh hote hai
 This can prolong the life of a fistula and help protect the fistula from damage
 avi grapht, adhikansh maamalon main bahut kuch nalpravan ke samaan he, sivaay iske ki ek kritrim naadee kaa istemaal dhamni or shira ko jodne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This graft is usually made of synthetic material, often from PTFE, but sometimes chemically treated, using sterilized veins of animals
 grapht ko tab daalaa jaataa he jab marij kii deshi raktavahiki ek nalwran kii anumati nahin detii
 ve nalpravan se adhik teji se paripakv hote hai or gathan ke kai hafton baad tak upyog ke liye taiyaar rah sakate hai 
 haalanki, avi grapht ke sankuchit ho jane kaa ucch khatra rahata he, vishesh rup se grapht ko shira main jahaan se daalaa gaya he thik uske neeche vaali shira main
 sankuchan se aksar thakka yaa ghanaastrata hoti he
 As external substances, they are at risk of becoming infected
 grapht ko lagane ke anya sthanon ke vikalp uplabdh hai, kyonki grapht ko kaaphi lanbaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 Thus a graft can be inserted into the thigh or neck
 avi nalpravan main shiraparak catheter yaa grapht kii tulana main ek behatar upyog pratyakshta or astitv kshamta hoti he
 They also produce better patient salvage and have much fewer complications than grafts or venous catheters
 is kaaran se, centres for medicare and medicade ne ek fistula first inishiative sthapit kiya he, jiskaa lakshya he dialysis rogiyon main e

 There are three types of hemodialysis: conventional hemodialysis, daily hemodialysis, and nocturnal hemodialysis
 Below is a summary of an Ottawa hospital brochure
 jeern hemodialysis ko aamtaur par prayek saptaah teen baar kiya jaataa he, prayek upachaar ke liye kareeb 3-4 ghante, jiske dauraan rogi ke rakt ko ek tub ke madhyam se baahar nikaala jaataa he 3-400 cc / minute kii dar se
 yah tub 15, 16 yaa 17 gej kii sui se judaa hua hota he jo dialysis nalwran yaa grapht main ghusi hoti he yaa dialysis catheter ke ek port se judy hoti he
 The blood is then pumped through the dialyzer and the processed blood is then pumped back into the patient's blood through another tube
 is prakriya ke dauraan, rogi ke raktchaap par najdiki najar rakhi jaati he or agar yah kam ho jaataa he, yaa rogi main nimna rakt maatra kaa koi anya lakshan viksit hota he, jaise ki mitli, to dialysis parichar mashin ke madhyam se atirikt taral padaarth de saktaa he
 During treatment, the patient's entire blood volume is circulated through the machine every 15 minutes
 dainik hemodialysis kaa istemaal aam taur par un rogiyon dwaara kiya jaataa he jo ghar par hi apana dialysis karte hai
 It is less stressful, but requires more access
 yah catheter ke saath aasaan he, lekin nalpravan yaa grapht ke saath adhik samasyagrast he
 The "buttonhole technique" can be used for fixtures that require frequent access
 dainik hemodialysis ko aam taur par ek saptaah ke chah dinon main do ghante ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The procedure of night hemodialysis is similar to conventional hemodialysis, except that it is performed six nights per week and takes six to ten hours per session, during which the patient remains asleep
 hemodialysis mashin rogi ke rakt or apohit ko apohak ke madhyam se pump karti he
 Modern dialysis machines in the market are highly computerized and continuously monitor critical safety parameters, such as blood and dialysis flow rates; Dialysis solution conductance, temperature and ph; Analysis of dialysis for evidence of blood leakage or presence of air
 Any reading that is outside the normal range triggers an audible alarm to alert the technician caring for the patient
 dialysis mashiinon ke nirmaataaon main shaamil hai fresenius, gambro, baxtor, bi
 brown, nexstage or belko
 a comprehensive water purification system is absolutely critical for hemodialysis
 kyonki dialysis rogi pani kii vishaal maatra ke prati ujagar hote hai, jo dilaset kaa nirmaan karne ke liye dilaset sankendran ke saath mishrit hota he, mineral pradooshak yaa bacterial antarjeevvish rogi ke rakt main pravesh kar sakate hai
 Because damaged kidneys cannot perform their intended functions to remove impurities, ions entering the blood through water can reach dangerous levels, resulting in many symptoms or death
 aluminium, chloramine, fluoride, tamba or jasta, saath hi bacteria tukade or antarjeevvish aadi sabhi is sambandh main samasyaon ke kaaran he
 For this reason, the water used in hemodialysis is carefully purified before use
 shuru main ise filtard or taapmaana samyojit kiya jaataa he or uske piech ko ek acid yaa aadhaar jodakar shuddh kiya jaataa he
 Then it becomes soft
 uske baad jaivik pradooshak ko sokhne ke liye koyale kii lakdi yukt tank ke madhyam se pani choda jaataa he
 The primary purification is then done by vigorously releasing water into a membrane with a small opening called a osmosis reverse membrane
 isse pani ko jane kii anumati milti he, lekin bahut chote viley ko roke rakhata he jaise electrolites
 bache hue electrolites ko antim rup se hataane ke liye aayan exange regin ke saath ek tanks ke madhyam se pani ko choda jaataa he jo ki bache hue sabhi aayan yaa fatayan ko saaf karata he or unhen hydroxil or hydrogen anu ke saath sthanantarit kar detaa he or pani ko atishuddh kar detaa he
 Even this level of water purification process may be inadequate
 haal hi main ek pravriti dilager jhilli ke madhyam se is antim shuddh pani ko paas kiya jaataa he
 This provides another layer of protection, particularly from defects of bacterial origin, which may have accumulated in the water after passing through the original water purification system
 jaise hi shuddh pani ko dilaset sankendran ke saath mishrit kiya jaataa he, isaki chaalakata bad jaati he or tab se pani jo ki aayan yukt hoti he bijli yojit karti he
 During dialysis, the conductivity of the dialysis solution continuously ensures that water and dialysate concentrations are mixed in the appropriate proportion
 atyadhik sankendrit dialysis samaadhaan or atyadhik taral samaadhaan, donon hi gambhir naidanik samasyaayein paidaa kar sakate hai
 The dialyzer is a piece of equipment that actually purifies the blood
 vartmaan main upyog kiye jane vaale lagbhag saare apohak khokhale-fibre prakaar ke hai
 a cylindrical bundle of hollow fibers, whose walls are composed of semi-permeable membranes, has a potting compound on both sides
 is sangyojan ko phir chaar nikaas ke saath ek spasht plastic ke belanaakaar khol main daal diya jaataa he
 An opening edge or blood port on the end of each cylinder makes contact with each end of the bundle of hollow fibers
 yah apohak ke "rakt compartment" kaa nirmaan karata he
 Two other ports are cut into the side of the cylinder
 yah khokhla fibre "dialaset compartment" ke aas-paas ke sthanon se sampark banaata he
 Blood is pumped through the blood port through a bundle of very thin capillary-like tubes and dialysate is pumped through the surrounding locations of the fiber
 dabaav pravanta ko tab lagu kiya jaataa he jab isaki zarurat drav ko rakt se apohak kampartment main bhejne ke liye hoti he
 Dialogous membranes come with different follicles
 jo kaaphi chote chhed ke aakaar ke saath aate hai unhen "nune-pravaah" or bade romakup aakaar waalon ko "ucch pravaah" kaha jaataa he
 Some large molecules, such as beta-2-microglobulin, can be removed anytime with low-flow dialyzers; Later high flow dialyzer started being used
 haalanki, is tarah ke apohak ko uchit taur par drav dar ko hataane ke liye or jhilli ke madhyam se rogi main apohak samaadhaan ashuddhi ke prativaah ko rokane ke liye nae apohak mashiinon or ucch gunvattta vaale apohak samaadhaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The dialyzer membrane was mainly made up of cellulose
 aisi jhilli kii sataha bahut zyada jaivikanuroop nahin the, kyonki ujagar hydroxil samooh jhilli ke dwaara rakt sanchaar main poorak ko sakriy kar detii he
 Therefore, the basic, "unsubstituted" cellulose membrane was modified
 isamen ek badlaav yah tha ki acitate samooh ke saath in hydroxil samoohon ko cover kiya gaya tha; or kuch yogicon main mishrit karnaa doosraa badlaav tha jo ki jhilli sataha main sakriyan poorak ko rokna hoga
 The original "unsubstituted cellulose" membrane is no longer widely used, while cellulose acetate and modified cellulose dialyzers are still used
 sallulosik jhilli yaa to kam pravaah yaa ucch pravaah vinyas main banaai ja sakati he, jo ki unke chhed ke aakaar par nirbhar karti he
 Another group of membranes is made of synthetic materials, using polymers such as polysalthersulfone, polyamide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polycarbonate, and polyacrylonitrile
 These synthetic membranes are activated to complement to a lesser degree rather than unsubstituted cellulose membranes
 synthetic jhilli ko kam yaa ucch pravaah vinyas main banaaya ja saktaa he, lekin adhikansh ucch pravaah se bane hote hai
 Nanotechnology has been most recently used in high flow membranes to construct an integrated ROM pore
 ucch pravaah jhilli kaa lakshya apekshaakrit bade anuon ko paas karnaa he jaise beta-2-microglobulin, lekin albumin ko paarit karnaa nahin he
 Each membrane has holes in a range of sizes
 jaise-jaise chhidr aakaar main vruddhi hoti he, kuch ucch pravaah apohak dilaset main rakt se albumin ko paarit karnaa shuru karte hai
 It is considered undesirable for this, although a group of thinkers considered that excluding albumin may be beneficial in terms of removing uremic poisons containing proteins
 ek ucch pravaah apohak kaa upyog rogi ke parinaamon main sudhaar karata he ki nahin yah kuch had tak vivaadaaspad he, lekin kai mahatvapurn adhyayanon ne suzav diya he ki yah ek chikitsiya laabh he
 The nih-funded HEMO trial compared hospitalization in patients randomized with low flow or high flow membranes to survival and dialysis
 yadhyapi praathmik parinaam, ucch pravaah jhilli kaa upyog karte hue yadrichhik samooh main mahatvapurn sankhyikeey main nahin pahunch paaen, kai madhyamik parinaam ucch-pravaah main behatar the
 
 a recent Cochrane analysis concludes that the choice of membrane gain in the results has not yet been demonstrated
 
 yadrichhik pareekshan se ek europe sahyogi, MPO ke ek adhyayan, main marijon main mrityu shuruuaati apohak se tha jisamen ucch pravaah yaa nune pravaah jhilli kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha, jinhone ucch pravaah jhilli kaa istemaal uttarjivita main sudhaar laane ko mahatvaheen paaya gaya or nune cerum albumin str yaa madhumeh rogiyon main uttarjivita laabh paaya gaya
 High-flow dialysis membranes and / or intermittent online hemodiafiltration may also be beneficial in reducing complications of beta-2-microglobulin
 kyonki beta-2-microglobulin ek bada anu he, jiskaa aanvik bhaar kareeb 11,600 dalton he, yah kam pravaah vaale dialysis jhilli ke madhyam se paar nahin hota he
 beta-2-m is removed by high flow dialysis, but is removed more efficiently by IHDF
 kai varshon ke baad, hemodialysis vaale rogiyon main beta-2-em jamaav jatiltaaon kaa vikaas shuru ho jaataa he, jisamen shaamil he carpal tunnel syndrome, majja ulcer or jodon or anya utakon main is amiloid kaa sanchay
 beta-2-em amiloidosis bahut gambhir jatiltaaon ko paidaa kar saktaa he, jaise ki spondiloarthropathy or yah aksar kandhe ke jod kii samasyaon se sambhddha rahaa he
 Observational studies in Europe and Japan have suggested that the use of high-flux membranes in dialysis mode, or IHDF, reduces beta-2-m complications compared to regular low-flow dialysis
 apohak kai vibhinn aakaaron main aate hai
 a larger dialyzer with a larger membrane area typically removes more solutes than a smaller dialyzer, especially at higher blood flow rates
 For the respective solutes, it depends on the membrane permeability coefficient K0
 isliye apohak kshamta ko aam taur par K0A ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he - pargamyata gunank or kshetra ke utpaada ke rup main
 adhikansh apohak kaa jhilli kshetra 0
8 se lekar 2
2 varg meter hota he or K0A kaa mulya aksar 500 se 1500 ml / min hota he
 K0A expressed in ml / min can be considered as the maximum clearance of dialyzer at very high blood and dialysis flow rates
 apohak ko yaa to har ilaaj ke baad khaarij kiya ja saktaa he yaa punah istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Reuse requires an extensive process of high-level disinfection
 dubaara istemaal vaale apohak ko marijon ke bich saajha nahin kiya jaataa he
 There was initial controversy about whether reusing dialyzers worsened patient outcomes
 aaj sarvasammati yah he ki apohak kaa pun: upyog agar dhyaan se or sahi tareeke se kiya jaae to uskaa parinaam vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa ki apohak ke ekal upyog kaa hota he
 Based on the best available evidence and diagnostic practice manual, adapted from nursing practice recommendations developed by the Canadian Nephrology and Technical Association, a nephrology nurse should demonstrate: hemodialysis sanvahani abhigam: prayek dialysis se pehle yaa baad main nalwran / grapht or baanh kaa akalan: abhigam pravaah, jatiltaayen kendriya shiraparak catheter kii jatilta kaa akalan: tip avasthaapan, nikasi sthaan, jatiltaayen kisi bhi chintaa ke bare main uchit swasthya dekhbhaal pradaata ko suchit karen

 Modern pacemakers usually have a variety of functions
 inamen se sabase buniyadi kaary hriday ke mul vidyut lay par najar rakhana he
 When the pacemaker fails to feel the heartbeat over a period of time between normal beats, it will stimulate the ventricles of the heart with a very low pulse of voltage
 iskaa samvedan or uttejit karne kii sakriyata harek dhadkan ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Its more complex form involves the ability to sensate and / or stimulate both the atrial and ventricular cells
 isamen se buniyadi venticular kii maang vaala pacing mod VVI he yaa vyaayaam ke liye swachaalit dar par samaayojan ke saath VVIR he – aalind ke taal ke saath jab synchronigeshan kii jab aavashyaktaa nahin hoti tab yah mod upyukt hota he, jaisaa ki aatrial fibrilation main
 samakaksh aalind pacing mod AAI yaa AAIR he, jab aatrioventicular sthiti akhand hota he, lekin prakritik pesamekar kaa sinoatrial node avishwasaneey – sinus node digis yaa biimaar sinus syndrome ho to yah pasandida mod hota he
 Where there is a problem with the atrioventricular block, the pacemaker is needed to detect the atrial rhythm and normalize the ventricular rhythm postoperatively until it is ready to do so - this is the VDD mode and with an electrode lead a single pacing in the right atrium and ventricle can be obtained from the lead
 AAIR or VDD ye mod US main asaamaanya hai, lekin latin america or europe main vyapak rup se iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The use of DDDR mode is the most common, as it has all options adjusted, although pacemakers require separate leads for the atrium and ventricles and are very complex, careful programming of their functions for the best results is needed
 venticular pesamekar, jo ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, ek tarah kaa pesamekar he jo baayen nilay ke donon jhilli kii diwaar or parshv donon main chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Pacing on both sides of the left ventricle can synchronize the pacemaker heart, which is not in contact with the synchronous wall, seen in 25–50% of heart patients
 CRT upkarnon ventrical main kam se kam do lead hote hai, ek daahine nilay kii jhilli ko uttejit karne, tathaa doosraa mahahardiki shira ke jariye baayen nilay ke parshv diwaar main chalaane ke liye daalaa jaataa he
 Often patients have a lead in the right atrium for synchronous palpability with atrial contraction for normal venous rhythm

 Sixty-one Hindi literature is a literature composed by a generation in which the tone of rebellion and anarchy was predominant after the year 1960, under the history of Hindi literature, which is largely believed to be quite different from the New Age era
 haalaanki iske saath-saath sahajata evam janavaadee chetana kii samaanaantar dhara bhi sahitya-kshetra main pravahamaan rahi jo baad main pradhan ho gayi
 In the sixties, the rebellious consciousness movement became primarily vocal in the field of poetry
 isliye isse sambandhit saare aandolan mukhyatah kavita ke aandolan rahe
 However, the story and other genres too had a substantial impact and in the field of story also, a movement like 'akhani' took shape
 san saath ke aasapaas nayi kavita kii dhara apane se kuch alag hoti dikhne lagi
 The new twist that is targeted after sixty is not a new thing to look at all of a sudden, but only by new poetry
 saath ke baad kii kavita main asantosh, asweekruti or vidroh kaa swar bahut saaf taur par ubhara he
 The tone of dissatisfaction and disapproval is present in the new poem as well, but after sixty this tone has taken the form of more intense satire and rebellion, going too close to the broken idols of life, their brokenness, agony and rejection from it Has recognized the fierceness of nayi kavita kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he ki usne samgr jivan kii pramanik anubhutiyon ko unke jivant parivesh main vyakt kiya
 He understood the significance of the poem only in highlighting every small and big truth of life through symbols and images, by breaking the siege of the subject or cognition of the subject and made of different visions or promises
 lekin kul milakar nayi kavita ke kaviyon main pidaa ke baavjood bhavishya nirmaan ke prati sakaaratmak aashaa bhi bani rahi
 Due to the conditions of post-independence India, there was a lot of frustration and breakdown in them, but there was also a weak hope of fulfilling dreams
 mohabhang yaa disilusenment puure rup main nahin hua tha, isliye nayi kavita main yatnaa-bodh he, asweekruti kaa swar bhi he, kintu vidroh kaa ubhaar nahin he
 Gradually 'illusion' broke down, disillusioned
 vyakti kaa saamaajik parivesh or bhi kurup lagane laga, bhavishya ke sapane tuutate gayi
 In the words of Dr
 Bachchan Singh, there was no light in the sun grown by the poets - the reception of the sun went in vain
 anek sahityakaron ko do hi raste najar aane lage ki yaa to ve nayi kavita ke pradhan swar main swar milakar pidaa kii mukt anubhuti ko or gahanta se vyakt karte athwa ye sari paristhitiyaan unke samvedansheel man ko jhakazorkar or yatnaa ke bich se ubhar kar unhen vidrohi banaati hui sab-kuch asweekaar karne ko prerit karne lageen
 Both these streams remained in the literature, but immediately after the sixties, the rebel stream was predominant, most of which were malevolent or sexually perverse
 nirlakshya hone se ye kavitaayen suvidhaatmak rup se vidroh karne vaali huin yani jahaan vidroh karne main khatra anubhav ho vahaan nahin, jahaan suvidha ho vahaan vidroh hota rahaa

 According to Dr
 Bachchan Singh, "modernity" is actually the name of new, non-romantic and non-romantic interviews of heterogeneous human conditions arising as a result of new science and technology
 " Modernist literature is a special kind of literature

 It does not accept the beliefs of the world, adopting the tradition as fetters

 Opposes the crowd, is a believer of the person's salvation
 vah apane ko a-maanav kii sthiti main paata he, or sneh, kritagyata aadi ko nishkasit kar detaa he
 Its characteristics or 'motif' are lack of restraint, experimentation, sabotage of literature forms, attitude of giving shock, aspiration for resentment-violence etc
 nayi kavita se vilgau anubhav karte hue kavy-kshetra main jo anek pravritiyaan sakriy raheen, unamem sabase adhik ullekhneey he ginsburg aadi america bitanicon tathaa unase prabhavit bengal ke malay raichaudhuri or subimal basaa jaise bhukhi peedi ke kaviyon ke samanaantar hindi main ubharne vaale raajakmal choudhary tathaa akavita or asweekrut kavita se sambaddh kuch anya kavi jinhone 'hetro sexuality' evam 'open sikresi' kii beet dharanaon ko apanaakar samaaj se apane ko 'disephiliet' karne kaa praytn kiya
 Nude use of sexual terminology in his poetry is often found in the form of rites and mutilation to express his distress and resentment

 The Beatnik movement came to Hindi as a fashion and in no time became disinterested because its roots were not in the realities of the country
 vastutah ye gusse ke kavi the
 He kept venting his anger in his angry speech
 purvavarti samast mulyon or paramparaon ko nakaar kar ve apni chikhon, jakhmon or yon-vidrupataaon ko kavita main vyakt karte rahe
 However, the euthanistic, neo-progressive or neo-progressive poets, while emphasizing social values, expressed their disagreement with these beatniks
 nayi kavita ke uparant hindi kavy ke kshetra main thodi si hi avadhi main itane adhik naare sunai diye, itane adhik aandolan aaye ki vishwa ke kisi anya sahitya main itani kam avadhi main itane adhik naare or andolan kabhi nahin utpann hue
 Some of these movements and slogans were buried in the neck of time, but some grew on the path of development
 vastutah in andolanon kii poshak rachanaayen ek-duusare se milti-julati bhi raheen tathaa kabhi-kabhi to ek hi kavi kai andolanon kaa anugami rahaa
 This time of literature was a time of chaotic flood of movements
 mukhyatah kavita-pradhan in andolanon ke naam is prakaar hai- There were many pro-system movements along with anti-system movements in the poetry-movements that came like floods in this decade; But often there was a lack of systematic thinking in all these movements, due to which almost all these proved to be short-lived
 in donon prakaar ke mukhya andolanon kaa saamaanya parichay agrankit sheershakon main drashtavy he
 In the March 1962 issue of 'bharati', Sri Virendrakumar Jain announced the new poem 'sanatan Suryodayi'
 apana mantavya vyakt karte hue unka kahana tha ki " patan-paraajay, kuntha, atmpidana or jivit aatmghaat ke asujh andhkaar main aatmahaara dishaharaa hokar bhatak rahi aaj kii anaath kavy chetana ke sammukh ham-- alp se mahat main le jane vaali, andhkaar se prakaash main le jane vaali, mrityu se amrit main le jane vaali or seemaa main aseem kii lila ko utaar laane vaali-- aagaamee kal kii anivaary sanathan suryodayi nutan kavita dhara kaa dwaar mukt karte hai
 "thus the main tone of this movement was of the system, but only after 3 years, in the February 1965 issue of 'bharati', instead of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita', the tone of 'nutan Kavita' was heard
 gangaaprasad vimal jaise 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke bhootpurv samarthak swayan 'akavita' varg main sammilit ho gayi
 The Yuyotsavist poem is related to a magazine called 'yuyutsa'
 yuyutsavadi kavita ke pravartak shalab shriram singh the
 He has been of the opinion that primitive Yuyutsa is the main inspiration of literature
 unka kahana he ki "main sahityasarjan kii mul prerana ke rup main usee aadim yuyutsa ko sweekaarta hoon jo kahin na kahin prayek kranti, parivartan athwa vighatan ke mul main pramukh rahi he
 It can be anything young, zoological, puerile, platonic or platonic
 " april 1965 kii 'roopambara' main 'prarambh' ke antargat swadesh bhartiya dwaara 'sabakaa ek maatr kaaran yuyutsa' kii ghoshnaa karte hue shalab shriram singh kaa yah uddhran diya gaya tha
 'rupambara' itself appeared in the 'adhyunatan Kavita issue' of August 1966 as a 'yuyotsavist Navlakhan Pradhan co-operative effort', with statements from three poets
 sampadak ne nayi samvedansheeltaa kii baat bhi uthaayi
 Vimal Pandey, Rameshwaradatta Manav, Om Prabhakar, Bajrang Bishnoi etc
 also related themselves to this movement
 vimal pandeya ne 'yuyutsawad' ko 'engri yang main' se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya
 Shri Om Prabhakar considers Yuyutsa as a synonym for Jeejivisha, considering 'wariness' to be an eternal instinct
 bajrang bishnoi ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko yuyutsa se jod diya he
 In the July '66 issue of 'utkarsh' magazine, Shriram Shukla raised the slogan of 'rejected Poetry' and introduced 'long Rejected Poem' titled 'sexual intercourse with dead woman'
 shukla ji ke liye 'sambhog kaa anubhav hi paryaapt he-- saat mahakavy likh le jane ke liye
 The poet of the spokesperson of the rejected poem believes - "the asymmetry of not telling the truth as truth is sometimes broken by breaking the barrier and only then is the birth of the rejected poem
" " tathaa "prastut yug main vyaapt, yatharth hote hue bhi asweekrut vishisht pravritiyon, sanvegon, sthitiyon, mulyon, asangatiyon or mood kii sampreshak kavita he
 "rejected poetry is a poem of sexual perversions
 ashleel shabdon kaa prayog inke liye sahaj sweekrut he tathaa inke anusaar ye 'naapsand vyavasthaaon ko badalane ke liye' vyagr hai
 Even if they cannot present a solution, they consider it their duty to 'draw the attention of the insane people by putting question marks on them'
 'akavita' kaa sutaradhar dow0 shyaam parmaar ko mana gaya he, parantu jagadish chaturvedi bhi unke saath baraabar ke bhagidaar the or 'akavita' ke aarambhik prastaavkon main the
 In fact, there were three editors of 'akvita' magazine - Jagdish Chaturvedi, Shyam Parmar and Rabindranath Tyagi
 'akavita' patrika main akavita ke samarthan main saidhantik lekh praayah nahin chaape jate the
 Those people believed that 'we will not speak'
 parantu, dow0 shyaam parmaar ne akavita ke samarthan main 'akavita or kala-sandarbh' sheershak se baqayada pustak bhi likhi, jisamen bahuvidh akavita ko paribhaashit karne kaa praytn kiya gaya
 Jagdish Chaturvedi calls this poetry as 'abhinav Kavya', due to the awareness of the monotony, inconsistency and sacramental expression of life lived on the intellectual level by the poets of this class and separation from the ancient tradition of poetry
 Are that "they can be enumerated as meaningful carriers of 'anti-poetry'"
 " parantu shyaam parmaar akavita ko anti kavita yaa kavita virdohi nahin maanate
 They consider Akavita to be an 'investigative poem of contradictions'
 unke anusaar is kavyandolan kii visheshta is tathy main he ki "kaviyon kii pravritiyaan alag-alag manahosthitiyon se judi hai
 "" Akavita is a tenacious poem
 vah simit samay kii kavita hogi, kyonki use bhavishya main jhande nahin gaadna hoga
 Many levels of expression are possible in "and" avaita
 bhashaa or kathy main vah patibaddh nahin he, isliye 'flexbal' he
 It has complex and 'tipsy' processes - straight and broken things
 " akavita ke pravaktaa kavi ne yah bhi ullekh kiya he ki "akavita ke liye nayi kavita yaa navagit virodh yogya nahin hai
 People of the movement instinctively call it a faction or conspiracy
 " Akvita's movement was also accused of being associated with the Beatnik movement
 parantu, iske prastaavkon jagadish chaturvedi evam shyaam parmaar ne bitanicon ke vyavhaar ko spashtatah nindaneey bataaya tathaa usase 'akavita' ke judaav se bilkul inkaar kiya
 The names of Girijakumar Mathur, Prabhakar Machwe, Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal, Vimal and Atul etc
 were also found in the proposers of 'akvita' magazine, which originated from 1965 to 67
 is sandarbh main saumitr mohan tathaa mudrarakshas kii rachanaayen bhi ullekhneey hai
 Dr
 Prabhakar Machwe due to American Beatnik influence, Rajkamal Chaudhary due to Bangla influence and Trilochan and Shamsher Bahadur Singh due to Ginsberg influence also associated themselves with beat poetry
 'kriti' or 'abhivyakti' naamak patrikaon main machave ji ne apni dharna ko ghoshit bhi kiya
 Poets of 'rebel generation' published from Allahabad also showed this effect indirectly
 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak lakshmikant verma the
 Verma ji was one of the great supporters of the first 'new poem'
 unhone nayi kavita ke saidhantik vishleshan se sambandhit pehali mahatvapurn pustak likhi thi 'nayi kavita ke pratimaan'
 However, later on changing the recognition, he became the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 unhone 'taaji kavita' kaa andolan isliye chalaaya ki nayi kavita main ab kuch 'nayaapan' bhi shesh na rah gaya tha or vah ek khaas rup main pratishthit bhi ho chuki thi
 Varma ji also said that "much of the new poem was indirectly taken up by Naibhinal taking the vitality from the shadows
 " haalaanki 'taji kavita' kaa yah andolan bhi aage chal nahin sakaa
 Not even a single poet or writer who accompanied Verma ji appeared until July 1965 and "without any noise, 'fresh poetry' was buried in its own right
 " The name of Dr
 Parmanand Shrivastava is associated with committed poetry
 dow0 shrivastav kii dharna he : "main maanata hoon ki kavita ke saamne iske sivaay doosraa vikalp nahin he ki vah aaj kii sampurna manavniyati kaa saakshaatkaar kare or poonjeewaadi vyavastha dwaara prerit amanavikaran ke viruddh sangharsh kare
 "and" language is an important tool in the realm of committed poetry - the above struggle
 " dow0 shrivastav ne sangharsh ke swaroop ko bhi aage paribhaashit kiya he-- "patibaddh kavita main sangharsh sidhaa or sarthak shabd he-- uskaa koi chhadmavesh nahin he-- jo log kisi kism kii patibaddhta ko sweekaar nahin karte ve jhootha sangharsh rachate hai or us main majaa lete hai
 Thus, this movement was a system of movement away from modernism or anarchy and was a form of Marxism
 iske peeche ek vichaardhaara, ek raajnneetik drushti thi
 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, the narrator of Sahaja poetry, has been considered
 is andolan kaa bhi aadhuniktawaad yaa araajaktaa se dur dur tak koi sambandh nahin tha
 Its supporters included Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Acharya Nandadulare Vajpayee, Agnayya, Dinkar, Dr
 Nagendra, Dr
 Devaraj, Dr
 Indranath Madan, Dr
 Prabhakar Machve and Ramdarash Mishra
 dow0 shyaam parmaar tathaa raajakmal choudhary ne bhi ise samarthan diya tha
 In March 1967, the release of Sahaj Kavita was published
 vijyapti ke kuch ansh is prakaar hai-- "san '60 ke baad ek varg main manarism kaa croftmanship ko hi mul lakshya mana or hindi kavita kul milakar tedi rekhaon ke vyapaar ke rup main saamne aayi
 That is why it has been fashion and not very meaningful



 " atah yah kavita kaa lakshya "naye sire se kavita kii khoj karnaa" he
 Dr
 Parmanand Srivastava, Rajendra Prasad Singh, Dr
 Kumar Vimal, Shrikant Joshi, Dr
 Shyamsunder Ghosh, Dr
 Vishwambharanath Upadhyay, Dr
 Ganapatichandra Gupta and Shivapratap Singh supported Sahaja Kavita in their articles of collection called 'sahaja Kavita' published in 1968 AD
 dow0 rabindra bhramar ne apane lekh main sahaj kavita ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya-- "prastut sandarbh main 'sahaj' shabd kaa vyutpattimulk arth lenaa hoga 'sah jaayate iti sahajah
 'that is, the creation which takes birth in the tangible medium of speech with true sensation momentum, it is easy
 is drushti se anubhuti kii pramanikta praathmik vastu he
 If the feeling is direct and authentic, then the expression will be unnatural and uncomplicated
 " tathaa "sahaj kii maang vyashtimulak hote hue bhi samajasaapeksh he
 "dr
 Bhramar has also associated the question of commitment with Sahaja poetry:" Sahaja poetry is fully committed to the life and creative responsibility of his era
 uske mul main sahaj sampurna jivan kii pratiti or sahaj sugathit shilp ke madhyam kii khoj kaa ek eemaandaar praytn nihit he
 " navagit kaa naam farvari 1958 main mujffarpur se prakashit 'gitangini' naamak patrika main dikhaai diya
 Some new songs were also compiled in this magazine
 kuch lekhak navagit kaa vikaas nayi kavita ke hi samanaantar maanate hai or use nayi kavita kii ek vishesh style maanate hai
 The first collected anthology of 'navgeet', 'kavita', was published in 1964 in the editing of Om Prabhakar
 iske saath hi dow0 rabindra bhramar, ramdarsh mishra tathaa dow0 ramesh kuntal megh navagit ke pravaktaaon ke rup main saamne aaye
 In this compilation, songs of many lyricists from Nirala to the new generation were compiled
 navagit kaa yah andolan anya saathottaree kshanjivi andolanon se bilkul bhinn rahaa
 Neither it had anything to do with anarchy etc
 nor any tendency to give that kind of shock etc
 yah vidha apane aap ko sthapit kar chuki he
