 Many of the theories of stage magic are outdated
 kisi chakkar main daal dene vaali baat ke varnan ke liye kaha jaataa he, “yah sab dhuen or darpan ke saath kiya jaataa he”, lekin in prabhaavon ke liye aaj, sansthapana kaary kii maatra or parivaham kii samasyaon ke kaaran shaayad hi kabhi darpanon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the ghost of the stage Indrajal chilli was first used in 19th-century London, requiring a specially constructed theater
 aadhunik kalakaaron ne taj mahal, setchu of liberty or ek antariksh yaan jaisi badi vastuon ko anya prakaar ke drishy dhokhon se gaayab kiya he
 There is a discussion among magicians on how to classify an effect and there is disagreement as to which categories actually exist — for example, some magicians consider "penetrance" to be a separate category, while others "penetration" is considered a form of precession or teleportation
 gaay hollingworth or tom stone jaise kuch jaaduugaron ne aaj, is vichaar ko chunauti dena aarambh ki diya he ki sabhi jaadui prabhaavon ko simit sankhya main kuch shreniyon main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Sorcerers who believe in a limited number of categories have disagreement over how many categories of effects there are
 inamen se kuch neeche soochibaddh hai
 Many magical processes use a combination of effects
 udhaaharan ke liye, "cap or gend" main ek jaadugar gaayab karne, paidaa karne, dur preshan yaa pratisthaapan kaa ek prastuti ke bhaag ke rup main istemaal kar saktaa he
 Traditionally, magicians refuse to tell the audience about the tricks used for their magic feat
 ise raaj banaakar rakhane ke nimnlikhit kaaran hai: Membership in organizations of professional magicians often requires the magicians to take an oath to solemnly demonstrate their commitment not to reveal the secret of magic to anyone other than magicians
 Wizards of wizards may vary but are almost identical, following: ek baar shapath lene ke baad vyakti ko jaadugar maan liya jaataa he or usase is vaade ko nibhaane kii aashaa kii jaati he
 The magician who for some reason tells this secret to others or by which it exposes this secret accidentally, other magicians do not want to teach any other magic
 phir bhi jo vyakti jaadu siikhnaa or jaadugar bananaa chahta he uske saamne jaadu ke peeche kaa rahasy bataaya ja saktaa he
 It is a completely gradual process in which simple and common magic is first taught and then gradually more important and lesser known magic feats are taught
 lagbhag sabhi jaadooi karnaamon ke raaj janata ko jaadu ke vishay par aadhaarit anek kitabon or patrikaon main main mil sakate hai jo vishisht jaadooi saamagree vikritaon ke paas uplabdh ho sakate hai
 Many websites also have videos, DVD images and instruction materials of the magic exploits and the secrets behind it
 is prakaar, bahut kam jaadooi kartab ke rahasy agyaat hai, lekin iskaa arth yah nahin he ki logon main jaadu ke prati aakarshan kam ho gaya he
 Apart from this, magic is a vibrant art and new tricks come to the fore, which keeps its attraction constant
 kabhi-kabhi kuch nae kartab kisi aise puraane kartab se prerit hote hai jo ab prasiddh nahin rahe
 Some magicians get into the situation that some spells reveal the secrets of tricks and thus they make it more popular by revealing the cleverness of magic or hand cleaning
 pan or tailor praaia: is baat kaa khulaasa karte rahete hai ki ve kis prakaar jaadu kaa khel dikhaate hai, udhaaharan ke liye – yadhyapi ve lagbhag har baar kuch nae karname karte hai, ant main ve bataate hai ki unhone yah kaam kis tarah kiya
 Often the revelation of magic tricks is only to be confused in another way
 udhaaharan ke liye – jaadugar ek darshak ko samajhaate hai ki linking ring main ek chhed he or apane sahaayakon ko do analink ring dete hai or unke sahaayak pate hai ki jaise hi jaadugar ise haath lagaate hai, ye jud jate hai
 Here the magicians forcefully insert their hands into the ring and claim - see? Once you understand that there is a hole in all the rings, this feat seems easy! " jaadu ke prati samarpan or is kala ke prati patibaddhta or kaary sambandhi naitikta evam uttardaayitv, jo iske prayog se sambandhit he; se vishwaas or srujanaatmakataa aati he
 Teaching magic was once a secret task
 samaaj ko yaa aam janata ko jaadu ke raaj jaanane se rokane ke liye peshewar jaadugar aise kisi bhi vyakti ko apana gyaan nahin baantnaa chaahate the jo is peshey main nahin ho
 This often makes it difficult for an aspiring trainee to learn the basics of magic
 sthapit jaaduugaron ke atirikt anya jaaduugaron ke liye jaadu ke rahasy dusron par ujagar karne se nishedh sambandhi sakht niyam hai
 Reginald Scott's book Discovery of Witchcraft continued to be published from the end of the 19th century to 184, but magicians then had only a few books available to learn this art, while many more are available in the market today

 Nevertheless, they contain performances and interpretations in the visual medium
 jo vyakti jaadu seekhney ke icchhuk hai ve magic club jwine kar sakate hai
 Here both experienced and novice magicians can work together and teach new techniques, discuss all aspects of magic and display magic to each other - mentoring, encouraging or criticizing each other in mutual development
 Can cooperate kisi jaadugar ko aisa koi club jwine karne se pehle saamanyat: apane jaadu kaa pareekshanatmak pradarshan karnaa padataa he
 The purpose of this test is to make sure that the aspiring person is actually a magician, not a normal person walking the road who wants to know the secrets of magic

 Magical performances come in certain specialties or styles
 kuch aadhunik jaaduugaron kaa kathan hai ki aisa pradarshan jo ki ek chatur or kushal dhokhe ke alawa kuch bhi hone kaa daawa karata hai, vah aniatik he
 Artist Jamie Ian Swiss, for example, accepts himself as an "honest liar"
 sikke kaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki kai kalakaaron kaa kahana he ki theatre ke ek rup main kisi naatak yaa film kii tulana main adhik tyaag karne kii jarurat nahin hai
 This approach is clearly reflected in the words of magician and mentor Joseph Düninger "for those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice"
 in jaahir taur par kattar virdohi vaicharik matbhedon ne kalakaaron ke bich kuch ko prashray dene kaa kaary kiya he
 For example, Udi Geller, a highly successful magician for over thirty years, demonstrated on television the mental power of his first spoon-turning act in 1970, his act provoking controversy among some magicians, as he claimed He did not show hand cleaning in his performances
 duusari ore, jabaki gailer ne ek or pradarshan ke dauraan chammach modane kaa karnama kiya, to unpar duningar kaa kathan sateek baithta hai Some people who show hand cleaning outside designated places of performance also resort to deceptive techniques for personal gain, some of which are disputed

 Despite the name, the use of javascript and XML is not actually required, nor does the request need to be asynchronous

 Ajax employs a combination of the following: saamagree kii atulykaalik loding ke liye takneekein san 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main aayin

 The term Ajax represents a large set of web technologies that are used to implement a web application that communicates with a server in the background, in the meantime it does not interfere with the current state of the page is

 Nearby tasks include the use of invisible iframes, which change the history of the browser and change the anchor part of the URL when Ajax is running and control it for changes

 Template: History of printing a laser printer is a common type of computer printer, which produces high-quality letters and images on a plain paper at a fast speed
 digital photocoprs yaa bahu-kaaryaatmak printers kii hi tarah leisure printer main bhi ek xerographic printing prakriya kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin yah analog photocoprs se is rup main alag hota he ki printer ke photocopear par ek leisure kiran kii pratyaksh scanning ke dwaara chhavi utpann kii jaati he
 a laser beam projecting an image of the page being printed, rotating on an electrically charged drum on which a layer of selenium is mounted
 prakaash-chaalakata un kshetron se aavesh ko hataa detii he, jin par prakaash pad rahaa ho
 The dry ink particles are then electrically picked up by the charged regions of the drum
 iske baad drum pratyaksh sampark or ushma, jo syaahi ko kagaz par milaati he, ke dwaara chhavi ko kagaz par print karata he
 Laser printers have several important advantages over other types of printers

 The fastest speed models can print more than 200 pages with one color per minute
 sabase tej gati vaale rangeen leisure printer prati minute 100 se adhik mudrit kar sakate hai
 Extremely high-speed laser printers are used for mass transmission of personalized documents, such as credit cards or convenience bills, and in some commercial applications they compete with lithography

 Printers with soft plastic drums can often have higher ownership costs, which may not be visible until replacement of the drum is required
 ek duplexing printer kagaz kii laagat aadhi kar saktaa he or file ke aaytan ko gata saktaa he
 Duplexers, previously available only in high-grade printers, are now common in mid-range printers as well, although not all printers can accommodate a duplexing unit
 The long path of paper in duplexing can also slow down the page-printing speed
 leisure printer kii tulana main, adhikansh ink-jet printer or dot-matrix printer keval data kii antargami dhara ko lete hai or use pratyaksh rup se ek dhimi jatkedaar prakriya main prakashit karte hai, jisamen kuch viraam bhi ho sakate hai kyonki printer adhik data ko paane ke liye pratiksha karata he
 Laser printers are unable to work with this method because such a large amount of data needs to be sent through a fast, continuous process to the printing device
 adhik data ke aane tak pratiksha karne ke dauraan printer mudrit prishth par ek drishy-maan antar athwa binduon ke acrekhan main truti nirmit kiye bina is kaarividhi ko paryaapt achookta ke saath nahin roak saktaa
 Instead, the data of the image is stored in a large collection of memory, which is able to display each point of the page
 mudran ke purv sampurna data ko sangrahit karne kii is aavashyaktaa ne leisure printers ko paaramparik rup se kagaz ke chote nishchit aakaaron, jaise A4, tak simit kar diya he
 Most laser printers are unable to print unbroken banners that span a two-meter long sheet of paper, because the printer does not have enough memory available to store such a large image before printing begins
 leisure printer kaa avishkaar xerokes main 1969 main anusandhankarta gairi starkwedar dwaara kiya gaya, jinhone 1971 tak ek unnat printer kaaryakshmata praapt kii or lagbhag ek varsh baad ise ek purna kaaryaatmak network printer pranali main sammilit kiya
 Its prototype was built by modification of the old xerographic copier
 starkwedar ne chithran pranali ko aksham kiya or 8 darpan bhujaaon se yukt ek ghoomanevaale drum, jis par ek leisure kendrit thi, kaa nirmaan kiya
 The light coming from the laser will hit the rotating drum and spread through the copier onto the surface
 Its hardware was completed in just one or two weeks, but the computer interface and software took about 3 months to complete
 leisure printer kaa pehla vanijyik karyanvayan 1976 main nirmit IBM model 3800 tha, jiskaa prayog chaalaanon or patr-label jaise dastavejon ke adhik maatra main mudran ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 It is often referred to as "an entire room taker", indicating that it was an early version of the familiar device used later with personal computers
 haalanki, iskaa aakaar bada tha, lekin ise ek purnatah bhinn uddeshy ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 Many 3800 models are still in use today
 kisi karyalayn vyavastha main prayog ke liye banaaya gaya pehla leisure printer 1981 main xerokes star 8010 ke saath release hua tha
 Although it was innovative, Star was a costly system, bought only by a relatively small number of business establishments and institutions
 personal computaron kaa vyapak prayog shuru ho jane ke baad, samuhik bazaar ko lakshya banaakar release kiya gaya pehla leisure printer 1984 main vimochit HP leisure jet 8ppm tha, jisamen HP software dwaara niyantrit canan ingine kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Soon after HP laser printers, Brother Industries, IBM and other companies also introduced their laser printers
 pehali-peedi kii mashiinon main bade prakaash-samvedansheel drum hote the, jinaki paridhi kagaz kii lambaai se adhik hoti thi
 Once the quick-recovery coating was developed, the drum could touch the paper multiple times in a single cycle and thus reduce its diameter
 adhikansh electronic upkarnon kii hi tarah, leisure printeron kii laagat bhi pichley kuch varshon main ullekhneey rup se kam hui he
 In 1984, the HP Laser Jet had a selling price of $ 3500, also had problems printing very small, low-resolution images and weighing 71 pounds
 2008 tak kii jaankaree ke anusaar nimna shrenee vaale ek rangeey printer aksar $75 se kam mulya par beche jate hai
 Often these printers lack processing on board and rely on the host computer to produce raster images, but still perform better than the laserjet Classic in almost all situations
 leisure mudran kii prakriya main vishisht rup se saat charan sammilit hote hai: Each horizontal plaque of dots across the page is called a raster line or scan line
 mudrit kii jane vaali chhavi kaa nirmaan vishishtatah leisure printeron main nirmit raster image processing dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Source material can be encoded in any particular page description language, such as Adobe postscript, HP Printer Command Language, or Microsoft XML page specification, or as unformatted text-only data
 raster memory main antim prishth ke bitmap ke nirmaan ke liye RIP dwaara prishth vivaran bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Once the entire page has been prepared in raster memory, the printer is ready to start the process of sending a rasterized flow of points on paper in a continuous stream
 pehle hulate packard leisure jet main keval 128 kilobite memory thi
 Typically it was used only for printing textual materials and it was not operated like modern graphic printers
 prishth varna soochna keval kuch kilobiton main rakhi jaati thi or mudran ke dauraan prayek raster scan rekha ke liye vaastavik bindu ko read onli memory main rakhi font bitmap saariniyon main dekha jaataa tha
 Additional fonts were kept in ROM cartridges, which were added to the expansion slot
 ek prishth varnan bhashaa kaa prayog karke purnatah chitramay parinaam paane ke liye 300 dpi par kisi ek-rangeey patr / A4 aakaar ke ek prishth kaa bhandaran karne ke liye nunatam 1 megabite memory kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 At 300 dpi, there are 90,000 dots per square inch
 kagaz kii ek vishisht 8
5 x 11 shit par 0
25 inch kaa hashia hota he, jisase mudranyogy kshetra ghatakar 8
0 x 10
5 inch yaa 84 varg inch rah jaataa he
 84 square / inch x 90,000 point per square / inch = 7,560,000 point
 Meanwhile 1 megabyte = 1048576 bytes or 8,388,608 bits, which is enough to hold an entire page of 300 dpi and spare 100 kilobytes of space to be used by the raster image processor
 rangeen printer main, chaar CMYK toner paraton main se prayek ko ek pruthak bitmap ke rup main rakhaa jaataa he or mudran se pehle sabhi chaar paraton kaa vishisht rup se prasanskaran kiya jaataa he, atah ek purna-rangeen patr ke aakaar ke prishth ke liye 300 dpi par nunatam 4 megabitis kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Memory requirements increase with the square of dpi, so 4 megabytes are required for monochrome at 600 dpi and 16 megabytes for color printing at 600 dpi
 kuch printeron main vibhinn aakaaron vaale binduon or antaraleey binduon kii kshamta hoti he; in atirikt visheshtaon ke liye yahaan varnit nunatam maatra se kai guna adhik memory kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Newspaper and larger-capacity printers may include memory expansion slots
 yadi uplabdh memory aparyaapt he, to kuch visheshtayen aksham kii ja sakati hai, jaise patr ke aakaar main rangeen mudran kii kshamta ho, lekin samachar-patr ke mudran main keval ek-rangeey mudran kar paane kii hi kshamta uplabdh ho
 Larger size color printing capability can be obtained by purchasing additional memory
 puraane printeron main, ek parimandal taar ko drum ke samanaantar lagaaya jaataa tha, yaa adhik haalia printeron main, ek praathmik aavesh roller, ek electrostatic aavesh ko photoriceptor, ek ghumta hua prakaash-samvedi drum yaa belt, jo ki andhera main hone par apni sataha par ek electrostatic aavesh ko rakh paane main sakasham hota he, par pryojit karata he 
 An AC pressure is applied to the primary charge roller to remove any residual charge left by the old image
 samaan nakaaratmak samarthy ko sunishchit karne ke liye roller drum kii sataha par DC dabaav bhi lagu karegaa
 The desired printing density is corrected by this DC pressure
 anek patent prakaash-samvedi drum coating ko ek prakaash-aaveshan parat, ek aavesh risaav-rodhi parat or saath hi ek sataha parat ke saath ek silicon sandwich ke rup main varnit karte hai
 One version uses amorphous silicon, which consists of hydrogen as a light receiving layer, boron nitride as a charge leak-proof layer, as well as a surface layer of doped silicon, notably silicon with oxygen or nitrogen, That machining in sufficient concentration appears similar to silicon nitride is used; This is the effect of a light charge diode with minimal leakage and resistance to rubbing
 leisure ko ek ghoomte hue bahubhujiya darpan par lakshyit kiya jaataa he, jo leisure kiran ko lenson or darpanon ke ek tantra se hokar ek photoriceptor kii ore bheja jaataa he
 This ray propagates on the photoreceptor at such an angle that the spread is across the surface; The cylinder rotates during this expansion and the angle of dispersion completes this motion
 silinder par binduon ke nirmaan ke liye memory main rakhe rasterikrut data kii dhara leisure ko shuru or band karti he
 
 prayek failaav chakra ke ant main leisure failaav prakriya ko samakalik karne ke liye ek beam detect samvedak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This invisible surface is exposed to fine particles of dried plastic powder mixed with toner, black carbon, or coloring agent
 aaweshit toner kanon ko ek rinatmak aavesh diya jaataa he or ve photoriceptor ke adrishy chitra, leisure dwaara sparsh kiye gayi kshetron, kii ore sthiravidhyut rup se aakarshith hote hai
 Since the same charge resists each other, the negatively charged toner will not touch the drum where the negative charge is present
 mudrit chhavi ke sakal kaalepan ko aapurti toner par lagu kiye gayi ucch voltage dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 Once the charged toner crosses the surface of the drum, the negative charge on the toner automatically resists the supplied toner and prevents excess toner from moving to the drum
 yadi voltage kam ho, to adhik toner ko sthanantarit hone se rokane ke liye toner kii keval ek patali parat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the voltage is high, a thin layer on the drum is too weak to prevent more toner from being transferred to the drum
 adhik aapurti toner drum par janaa tab tak jari rakhata he, jab tak ki drum par sthit aavesh aapurti toner kaa pratirodh karne ke liye punah paryaapt rup se ucch na ho jaayen
 sabase kaali setting par aapurti toner kaa voltage paryaapt rup se itnaa ucch hota he ki jahaan alikhit drum aavesh abhi bhi upasthit ho, vahaan vah bhi drum par parat chadhaanaa shuru karegaa or puure prishth ko ek kaali chaaya degaa
 The photoreceptor is pressed or pressed on paper, causing the image to move
 toner ko photoriceptor se kagaz par khinchne ke liye ucch-shrenee vaali mashine kagaz ke pichley bhaag main ek dhanatmak rup se aaweshit sthanantaran roller kaa prayog karti hai
 The fuser passes through the paper rollers in the assembly, where heat and pressure connect the plastic powder to the paper
 ek roller saamanytah ek poli nalee ke rup main hota he or doosraa ek rabar samarthit roller hota he
 a radiant heat lamp is hung in the center of the polly tube and its infrared energy heats the roller evenly from within
 toner kii upyukt judai ke liye fuzar roller samaan rup se garm hona chaiye
 Up to 90% of the electrical power used by the printer is used by the fuser roller
 fuzar asembli se utpann ushma printer ke anya bhaagon ko kshatigrast kar sakati he, atah aantarik bhaag se ushma ko dur hataane ke liye aksar ise pankhons se dhanka jaataa he
 The primary power saving feature of most copiers and laser printers is to close the fuser and allow it to cool
 saamaanya prachaalan ko punah praapt karne ke liye fuzar ke prachaalan taapmaana par lautne tak pratiksha karnaa aavashyak hota he, uske baad hi mudran prarambh ho saktaa he
 Some printers use a very thin flexible metal-framed fuser roller, so a small load needs to be heated and the fuser can reach operating temperatures very quickly
 aisa karnaa ek niskriy avasthaa se mudran ko gati pradaan karata he or saath hi bijli bachaane ke liye fuzar ko adhik shighrata se band hone kii anumati detaa he
 If the paper passes through the fuser at a more slow speed, the toner needs more contact time with the roller to melt and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature
 bade ucch gati vaale printeron, jinamein kagaz bahut kam sampark samay main ek ucch-taapmaana vaale fuzar se adhik tezi se guzarataa he, kii tulana main urja kii bachat karne vaale is dizine ke kaaran chote, saste leisure printer vishisht rup se dhimi gati se mudran karte hai
 When printing is complete, an electrically charged soft plastic blade cleans the excess toner from the photoreceptor and deposits it in a garbage repository, and an immersion lamp removes the remaining charge from the photoreceptor
 kagaz funs jane jaisi kinhin anpekshit ghatnaon ke kaaran toner kabhi-kabhi prakaash-chaalak par hi chhot jaataa he
 The toner is ready to be applied to the light-conductor, but the operation fails before it can be applied
 toner ko hataakar prakriya phir se shuru kerani chahie
 Corrupted toner cannot be reused for printing as it may deteriorate due to dust and paper fibers
 ek gunvatttapurvak mudrit chitra ke liye ek shuddh, saaf toner kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Reusing contaminated toner results in a bad printing area or bad fusing of toner on paper
 haalanki kuch apwaad hote hai, jinamein brother or toshiba ke leisure printer sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai, jo dooshit toner ko saaf karne or uskaa punarchakran karne ke liye ek patentikrut vidhi kaa prayog karte hai
 Once the creation of the raster image is complete, all steps of the printing process can occur one after another in rapid sequencing
 yah ek bahut choti or susambaddha ikai ke prayog kii anumati detaa he, jahaan photoriceptor aaweshit hota he, kuch anshon tak ghumta he or scan kiya jaataa he, kuch or anshon tak ghumta he or viksit hota he, is prakaar prakriya jari rahati he
 This entire process can be completed before a single drum orbit is completed
 bhinn-bhinn printer in charnon ko bhinn rup se kriyanvit karte hai
 Some "laser" printers actually use a linear range of light-emitting dialects to "write" the light onto the drum
 The toner is based on wax or plastic, so that when the paper passes through the fuser assembly, the toner particles are melted
 kagaz vipareet rup se aaweshit ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 fuzar ek infrared oven, ek garm kiya gaya dabaav roller yaa ek xenon flash lamp ho saktaa he
 The warm-up process that a laser printer goes through involves heating the fuser element primarily when the printer is first electrified to heat the printer
 anek printeron main ek toner-bachaav mod hota he, jise hulate-packard dwaara "iconomod" kaha jaataa he, jo toner kii lagbhag aadhi maatra kaa hi prayog karata he, lekin ek halkaa, masaude kii gunvattta vaala parinaam utpann karata he
 Color laser printers use color toner, typically green, blue, yellow, and black
 ek ore jahaan monocrome printer keval ek leisure scinar asembli kaa prayog karte hai, vahiin rangeen printeron main aksar do yaa adhik scinar asembliyaan hoti hai
 Color printing adds complexity to the printing process because there may be a very small error in the alignment between each color print, known as a registration error, which is unintended color edges, blurring, or lightness at the edges of colored areas / Produces deep stripes
 ucch panjiyan achookta kii anumati dene ke liye, kuch rangeen leisure printer ek bade ghoomte hue patte kaa prayog karte hai, jise "sthanantaran patta" kaha jaataa he
 The transfer strap passes through the front of all toner cartridges and each toner layer is clearly applied to the strap
 iske baad sanyojit paraton ko ek samaan ekal charan main kagaz par lagu kiya jaataa he
 Color printers generally have a higher "cents-per-page" production cost than monochrome printers
 1200 DPI printers aam taur par 2008 ke dauraan uplabdh the
 2400 DPI electrophotographic printing plate manufacturers, essentially laser printers that print on plastic sheets, are also available
 adhikansh upabhokta or chote vyavsaayik leisure printer ek toner cartrij kaa prayog karte hai, jo photoriceptor ko toner aapurti bhandar, avshisht toner hoper or vibhinn viper blades ke saath sanyojit karata he
 When consumption of the toner supply is complete, automatically replacing the toner cartridge replaces the illustration drum, residual toner hopper and wiper blades
 kuch leisure printer pichley rakh-rakhaav ke baad se abhi tak mudrit kiye gayi prishthon kii sankhya kii ek prishth-ginati rakhte hai
 On these models, a reminder will appear, informing the user that the time has come for replacement of standard maintenance parts
 anya modelon par, koi prishth-ginati nahin rakhi jaati yaa koi samaran-sandesh pradarshit nahin kiya jaataa, atah prayokta ko mudrit prishthon kaa record maanviya rup se rakhana padataa he or kagaz bharne kii samasyayon or mudran trutiyon jaise chetavanee suchakon ko dekhnaa padataa he
 Manufacturers usually provide a life expectancy list for common printer parts and consumables
 nirmaataa printer ke unke bhaagon ke liye jivan pratyaasha ko samay kii ikai kii bajaay "apekshit prishth-utpaadan jivan" ke sandarbh main moolyankit karte hai
 Consumables and maintenance parts for commercial-grade printers will be rated for a higher page-output expectancy than parts commonly used for individual printers
 Typically, the page-production expectancy of toner cartridges and fusers is generally higher in commercial-class printers rather than in an individual printer
 monocrome leisure printeron kii tulana main rangeen leisure printeron main rakh-rakhaav or purzon ke pratisthaapan kii adhik aavashyaktaa hoti he kyonki unamem adhik chithran ghatak hote hai
 For the rollers and assemblies involved in paper lifting paths and paper filling paths, removal of toner and dust from the procedure and replacing, cleaning and reinstalling the paper handling rubber rollers is a specific maintenance
 adhikansh pick-ap, feed or pruthakkaran rolers main ek rabar kii parat hoti he, jo antat ghisaav se prabhavit hoti he or kagaz kii phislan bhari dhul se dhank lee jaati he
 In cases where replacement rollers have been discontinued or are not available, rubber rollers can be safely cleaned with the help of a humid fur-free piece
 vanijyik rasinic vilyan bhi uplabdh hai, jo asthai rup se rabar ke karshan ko punah praapt karne main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 The fusing assembly is generally considered a replaceable consumable component on laser printers
 fuzing asembli toner ko pighalaane or use kagaz par jodne ke liye uttaradaayi hoti he
 Several errors are possible for fusing assemblies: errors include chronic plastic steering gears, electronic failure of heating components, dilute fixing film sleeve, chronic pressure rollers, toner deposition on heating rollers and pressure rollers, chronic or scratched pressure rollers
 And damaged paper sensors
 kuch nirmaataa bachaavatmak rakh-rakhaav kit pradaan karte hai, jo printer ke prayek model ke liye vishisht hoti he; saamanytah is kit main ek fuzar shaamil hota he or isamen pick-ap rolers, feed rolers, sthanantaran rolers, aavesh rolers or pruthakkaran rolers bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 Many modern color laser printers mark printed papers with an almost invisible dot raster for identification purposes
 ye bindu pile rang ke or lagbhag 0
1 mimi aakaar ke hote hai or raster lagbhag 1 mimi kaa hota he
 This is probably the result of an agreement between the US government and printer manufacturers to keep track of fraudsters
 binduon main mudran tithi, samay or printer anukramank jaisaa data binary-kodit dashamalwon main mudrit kagaz kii prayek shit par hota he, jo kharid ke sthaan or kabhi-kabhi kray-karta kii pahchaan karne ke kagaz ke tukdon ko nirmaataa dwaara jaanchane kii anumati detaa he
 Groups advocating digital rights, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, are concerned about this degradation of privacy and anonymity of printers
 yadhyapi aadhunik printeron main anek suraksha interlock or rakshaatmak paripath shaamil hote hai, lekin ek leisure printer ke bheetar vibhinn rolers, taron or dhaatu ke samparkon main ucch voltage yaa ek nivasee voltage upasthit hona sambhav he
 Caution must be taken to avoid unnecessary contact with these parts to reduce the possibility of traumatic electric shock
 toner ke kan electrostatic visheshtaon se yukt hone ke liye banaae jate hai or anya kanon, vastuon yaa parivahan pranaaliyon or nirvaat nalikaaon ke aantarik bhaagon ke saath ragade jane par ve sthir-vidyut aavesh viksit kar sakate hai
 Because of this and the small size of the particles, a conventional household vacuum cleaner should not be used to produce vacuum in the toner
 aaweshit toner kanon se utpann sthir nissaran vaikum clinar bag main dhul ko jala saktaa he yaa yadi paryaapt toner vayuvahit ho, to ek chota visphot nirmit kar saktaa he
 This can damage the vacuum cleaner or cause a fire
 iske atirikt, toner ke kan itane maheen hote hai ki unhen paaramparik gharelu vaikum clinar ke filter bag dwaara acchhee tarah nahin chaanaa ja saktaa he or ve motor se ud sakate hai yaa punah kamare main waapas aa sakate hai
 Toner particles melt when heated
 toner ke chote chhalakaavon ko ek thande, ardra kapade dwaara poncha ja saktaa he
 If the toner laser spills into the printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner consisting of an electrically charged hose and a high-efficiency filter may be required to clean it effectively
 inhen esd-surakshit yaa toner vaikum kaha jaataa he
 Vacuum fitted with this type of hepa-filter should be used for cleaning the large spills of the toner
 toner ko pani dwaara dhoye ja sakanevaale adhikansh vastron kii sahaayta se saraltapurvak saaf kiya ja saktaa he
 Since toner is a low melting temperature wax or plastic powder, it should be kept cool during the cleaning process
 toner kaa daag lage vastron ko thande pani main dhonaa aksar safal rahata he
 Even using hot water there is a possibility of the stain becoming permanent
 kapade daalane se pehle washing mashin main thanda pani bharaa janaa chahie
 Washing in two cycles increases the chance of success
 pehle chakra main bartanon ko haathon se dhoye jane vaale sabun kaa or duusare chakra main kapade dhone vaale saamaanya sabun kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The residual plume of toner will remain in the water used for washing in the first cycle and this can cause permanent grayness
 jab tak yah sunishchit na ho jaae ki puraa toner hataa diya gaya he, tab tak kapade sukhaanevaale kisi upkaran yaa istari kaa prayog nahin kiya janaa chahie
 As a natural part of the printing process, the high voltage within the printer can produce a percolation discharge, which produces a small amount of ionized oxygen and nitrogen, producing ozone and nitrogen oxides
 bade vanijyik printeron or copiyaron main, ek vaayu nikaas dhara main ek carbon filter in oxidon ko todta he, taaki karyaalay ke vaataavaran ko pradooshan se bachaaya ja sake
 However, some ozone escapes this filtering process in commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used in many small consumer printers
 When a laser printer or copier is used for a long time in a smaller, less ventilated space, these gases can rise to such high levels where ozone odor or irritation can be felt
 charam sthitiyon main ek swasthya khatre ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna saidhantik rup se sambhav he
 According to a recent study conducted in Queensland, Australia, some printers produce submicrometer particles, which some people associate with respiratory diseases

 However, of this number of machines studied, only those machines had already been placed in the building and were thus biased towards specific producers
 lekhakon ne is baat kaa ullekh kiya ki mashiinon ke ek hi model ke bich bhi kanon ke utsarjan main ullekhneey antar tha
 According to Professor Moravska of the University of Queensland, a printer emits as many particles as are emitted by burning a cigarette
 2006 main japan main kiye gaye ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki leisure printer styrine, zilin or ozone kii maatra ko badhaate hai or ink-jet printer pentanol kaa utsarjan karte hai
 Muhle etc

 hexadesimal kaa istemaal aam taur par computer memory adreson ko darshane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Template: Hexadecimal table In situations where reference is lacking, a hexadecimal number with numbers expressed in other root digits can be ambiguous and misleading
 spasht rup se maanon ko vyakt karne kii kai paddatiyaan prachlit hai
 a numerical subscript can express the root numeral clearly: 15910 is decimal 159; 15916 is hexadecimal 159, which equals 34510

 Most modern computer systems with a graphical user interface provide a built-in calculator utility that has the ability to perform conversions between different radixes, typically including hexadecimal
 microsoft windos main, calculator utility ko vaigyanik calculator mod main set kiya ja saktaa he, jo mulank 16, 10, 8 or 2 ke bich roopantaran kii anumati detaa he; sabase zyada aam taur par programmeron dwaara prayukt aadharank
 vaigyanik mod main, on-screen sankhyatmak keepad main a se lekar f tak hexadesimal ank shaamil hote hai jo "hex" kaa chayan karne par sakriy ho jate hai
 In hex mode, however, the Windows calculator only supports integers
 jaisaa ki anya sankhyatmak pranaaliyon ke saath hota he, hexadesimal pranali kaa istemaal parimey sankhyaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki aavarti ank aam hote hai kyonki solah main keval ek ekal abhajya gunankhand hota he: Where an overline indicates a recurring pattern

 Thus, whether one is divided by two for binary or one for hexadecimal is divided by sixteen, both of these factors are written as 0
1
 chunki mulank 16, ek purna varg he, isliye hexadesimal main vyakt gunan khand kii visham avadhi, aksar dashamalav main vyakt gunan khandon se kahin adhik hoti he or koi chakree sankhya nahin hoti he
 Recurring digits are displayed when the denominator of the lowest terms has a prime factorization not found in the radix; Thus, when using hexadecimal notation, all multiplication clauses with a denominator that are not powers of two are converted into an infinite string of recurring digits
 yah tarksangat sankhyaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye hexadesimal ko dashamalav kii tulana main kam suvidhajanak banaata he kyonki ek bahut bada bhaag parimit pradarshan kii seemaa ke baahar hi rah jaataa he
 All rational numbers that are finitely displayed in hexadecimal are also finitely representable in decimal, duodecimal, and hexadecimal: that is, any hexadecimal number with a finite number of digits has a finite number of digits when it is assigned to those other values
 Is expressed in iske vipareet, keval baad vaale mulaankon main parimit taur par pradarshneey hone vaala ek gunan khand, hexadesimal main parimit taur par pradarshneey hota he
 For example, an infinite recurring display in decimal 0

 haalanki, hexadesimal, har main do ke ghaat ke saath gunan khandon ko pradarshit karne ke liye 12 or 60 mulaankon se adhik kushal hota he 
 Perhaps it is easier to show the most widely used power, the power of two, using base 16
 do ke pehle solah ghaaton ko neeche dikhaaya gaya he
 Since the square of four is sixteen, the power of four has a simple relation: do or chaar kaa istemaal karte samay yah tetration ko or zyada aasaan bhi bana detaa he
 32 = 24 = 10 hex, 42 = 216 = 1 xxrep 4 0 hex and 52 = 265536 = hex
