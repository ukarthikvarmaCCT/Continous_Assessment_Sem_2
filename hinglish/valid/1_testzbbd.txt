 kuch anakani karne ke baad kevat ne teenon ko ganga nadi ke paar utaara
 On reaching Prayag, Rama met Bhardwaj Muni
 vahaan se ram yamuna snaan karte huye valmiki rishi ke ashram pahunche
 According to the mantra from Valmiki, Rama, Sita and Lakshman started living in Chitrakoot
 ayodhya main putr ke viyog ke kaaran dasharath kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 Vashistha called Bharata and Shatrughna from his maternal grandfather
 waapas aane par bharat ne apni mata kaikeyi kii, uski kutilata ke liye, bahut bhartasna kii or gurujanon ke aagyaanusaar dasharath kii antyeshti kriya kar diya
 Bharata rejected the kingdom of Ayodhya and refused Rama and went to Chitrakoot with all the affectionate
 kaikeyi ko bhi apane kiye par atyant pashchaatap hua
 Sita's parents Sunayna and Janak also reached Chitrakoot
 bharat tathaa anya sabhi logon ne ram ke waapas ayodhya jaakar rajya karne kaa prastaav rakhaa jise ki ram ne, pita kii ajna paalan karne or raghuvansh kii reeti nibhaane ke liye, amaanya kar diya
 Bharat, along with his affectionate people, came back to Ayodhya with Ram's paduka
 unhone ram kii paduka ko raaj singhaasana par virajit kar diya swayan nandigram main nivas karne lage
 After some time, Rama departed from Chitrakoot and reached the ashram of Atri Rishi
 atri ne ram kii stuti kii or unki patni anusuya ne sita ko pativrat dharm ke marm samajhaaye
 From there, Rama then proceeded further and met Sharbhang Muni
 sharbhang muni keval ram ke darshan kii kaamana se vahaan nivas kar rahe the atah ram ke darshanon kii apni abhilaashaa purna ho jane se yogagni se apane sharir ko jala daalaa or brahmalok ko gaman kiya
 And on proceeding, Rama was seen piling up bones from place to place, about whom the monks told Rama that the demons have eaten many sages and those are the bones of those sages
 is par ram ne pratigya kii ki ve samast rakshason kaa vadh karke prithvi ko rakshas viheen kar denge
 Rama proceeded further and met the sages like Sutixhan, Agastya etc
 in the path and entered Dandaka forest where he met Jatayu
 ram ne panchvati ko apana nivas sthaan banaaya
 In Panchavati, Ravana's sister Shurpanakha came and pleaded with Rama
 ram ne yah kah kar ki ve apni patni ke saath hai or unka chota bhai akelaa he use lakshmana ke paas bhej diya
 Laxman, rejecting his love, knowing the sister of the enemy, cut his nose and ears
 shurpanakha ne khar-dooshan se sahaayta kii maang kii or vah apni sena ke saath ladane ke liye aa gaya
 In the battle, Rama killed Khar-foul and his army
 shurpanakha ne jaakar apane bhai ravan se shikaayat kii
 Ravana sent Marich as a goldmine to take revenge, whose bark was demanded by Sita to Rama
 lakshmana ko sita ke raksha kii ajna de kar ram swarnamrig rupi marich ko maarane ke liye uske peeche chale gayi
 Marich was killed at the hands of the dying, but while dying, Marich made a voice of Rama and chanted 'ha Lakshman', which Sita apprehensively sent Lakshman to Rama
 lakshmana ke jane ke baad akeli sita kaa ravan ne chhalpurvak haran kar liya or apane saath lanka le gaya
 On the way, Jatayu fought with Ravana to save Sita and Ravana cut his wings and made him half dead
 sita ko na paa kar ram atyant duhkhi huye or vilaap karne lage
 On meeting Jatayu on the way, he told Rama about his plight by Ravana and to take Sita to the south
 ye sab bataane ke baad jataayu ne apane praan tyaag diye or ram uskaa antim sanskaar karke sita kii khoj main saghan van ke bheetar aage bade
 On the way Rama slaughtered the Gandharva Kambandha, who became a demon due to the curse of Durvasa, and reached the ashram of Shabari where he ate the false beers given by him under his devotion
 is prakaar ram sita kii khoj main saghan van ke andar aage badhate gayi
 Rama came near Rishimuk mountain
 us parvat par apane mantriyon sahit sugriv rahata tha
 Sugriva, fearing that Bali might not have sent the two heroes to kill him, sent Hanuman as a Brahmin to get information about Rama and Lakshmana
 yah jaanane ke baad ki unhen baali ne nahin bheja he hanuman ne ram or sugriv main mitrataa karvaa di
 Sugriva consoled Rama that Janaki ji would be found and he would help in finding him as well as told about the atrocities committed on his brother Bali
 ram ne baali kaa chhalpurvak vadh kar ke sugriv ko kiskindha kaa rajya tathaa baali ke putr angad ko yuvaraj kaa pad de diya
 After attaining the kingdom, Sugriva indulged in luxury and the rain and autumn passed
 ram kii naaraazgi par sugriv ne vaanron ko sita kii khoj ke liye bheja
 The apes looking for Sita saw a tapaswini in a cave
 tapaswini ne khoj dal ko yogashakti se samudratat par pahunchaa diya jahaan par unki bhent sampaati se hui
 Sampati tells the monkeys that Ravana has placed Sita in Lanka Ashokavatika
 jambavant ne hanuman ko samudr langhane ke liye utsahit kiya
 Hanuman departed towards Lanka
 surasa ne hanuman kii pariksha lee or use yogya tathaa samarthyavan paakar aashirwad diya
 En route, Hanuman slayed the demon that caught the shadow and entered Lanka by striking Lankini
 unki vibhishana se bhent hui
 Ravana was threatening Sita when Hanuman arrived at the Ashokavatika
 ravan ke jane par trijata ne sita ko santavana di
 On solitude, Hanuman met Sita and gave him the ring of Rama
 hanuman ne ashokavatika kaa vidhwans karke ravan ke putr akshay kumaar kaa vadh kar diya
 Meghnath tied Hanuman in Nagpash and took him to the assembly of Ravana
 ravan ke prashn ke uttar main hanuman ne apana parichay ram ke doot ke rup main diya
 Ravana tied a cloth immersed in oil on Hanuman's tail and set it on fire, on which Hanuman burnt Lanka
 hanuman sita ke paas pahunche
 Sita gave her Chudamani and sent them away
 ve waapas samudr paar aakar sabhi vaanron se mili or sabhi waapas sugriv ke paas chale gayi
 Rama was very happy with Hanuman's work
 ram vaanron kii sena ke saath samudratat par pahunche
 On the other hand, Vibhishan explained to Ravana that he should not hate Rama, on which Ravana humiliated Vibhishan and drove him out of Lanka
 vibhishana ram ke sharan main aa gaya or ram ne use lanka kaa raja ghoshit kar diya
 Rama pleaded to give way to the sea
 vinati na maanane par ram ne krodh kiya or unke krodh se bhaybheet hokar samudr ne swayan aakar ram kii vinati karne ke pashchaat nal or nil ke dwaara pul banane kaa upaay bataaya
 By order of the brothers of apes Jambavan tap-nile bridge on the sea with the help of the army tied up
 shri ram ne shri rameshwar kii sthapana karke bhagwaan shankar kii puja kii or sena sahit samudr ke paar utar gayi
 Ram camped across the ocean
 pul bandha jane or ram ke samudr ke paar utar jane ke samachar se ravan man main atyant vyakul hua
 Ravana's arrogance did not go away even after Mandodari convinced him not to hate Rama
 idhar ram apni vanarasena ke saath subel parvat par nivas karne lage
 Angad went to Ravana in Lanka as Rama's messenger and gave him the message of Rama's asylum, but Ravana did not listen
 shaanti ke saare prayaas asafal ho jane par yuddh armbh ho gaya
 a fierce battle ensued between Laxman and Meghnad
 shaktibaan ke waar se lakshmana moorchhit ho gayi
 Hanuman brought Sushen Vaidya for his treatment and went to bring Sanjeevani
 guptchar se samachar milane par ravan ne hanuman ke kaary main baadha ke liye kaalanemi ko bheja jiskaa hanuman ne vadh kar diya
 Due to lack of identification of the medicine, Hanuman lifted the whole mountain and went back
 maarg main hanuman ko rakshas hone ke sandeh main bharat ne baan maar kar moorchhit kar diya parantu yatharth jaanane par apane baan par baitha kar waapas lanka bhej diya
 Seeing the delay in the arrival of medicine, Ram began to bleed
 sahi samay par hanuman aushadhi lekar aa gayi or sushen ke upachaar se lakshmana swasth ho gayi
 Ravana woke Kumbhakarna to battle
 kumbhkarna ne bhi ravan ko ram kii sharan main jane kii asafal mantranaa di
 In the war, Kumbhakarna attained supremacy at the hands of Rama
 lakshmana ne meghnad se yuddh karke uskaa vadh kar diya
 Many fierce wars took place between Rama and Ravana and in the end Ravana was killed by Rama
 vibhishana ko lanka kaa rajya saunp kar ram sita or lakshmana ke saath pushpakavimaan par chadh kar ayodhya ke liye prasthaan kiya
 Uttarkand is the epilogue to the Ram Katha
 sita, lakshmana or samast vanarasena ke saath ram ayodhya waapas pahunche
 There was a grand reception of Rama, joy spread among the people along with Bharata
 vedon or shiv kii stuti ke saath ram kaa rajbhishek hua
 The farewell of the visitors was given
 ram ne praja ko upadesh diya or praja ne kritagyata prakat kii
 The four brothers had two sons

 Ramcharitmanas has an excellent description of Hindu ideals, hence it is credited with being the major text of Hinduism and is recited with devotion in every Hindu family
 ramayana se hi prerit hokar maithilisharan gupt ne panchvati tathaa saket naamak khandakavyon kii rachana kii
 The remarkable renunciation of Lakshmana's wife Urmila in the Ramayana has probably been overlooked, and this mistake has been corrected by Maithilisharan Gupta, who composed Saket Khandakavya
 ram sambandhi kathanak se prerit hokar shribhagavatanand guru ne sanskrit mahakavy shriraghvendracharitam kii rachana kii jo adbhut evam gupt kathaprasang se bharaa hua he

 Altai is a language family consisting of Turkish languages, Mongol languages, Tungusi languages, Japanese languages and Korean languages
 altaai bhashaayen uresia ke bahut hi vistrut kshetra main boli jaati hai jo purvi europe se lekar madhya asia se hota hua sidhaa japan tak jaataa he
 This family consists of about 70 living languages in total and the number of speakers who speak them is about 500 million in the present world
 bahut se bhashavaigyanikon ke is bhashaa-parivaar ke astitv ko manane ke baavjood kuch aise vidwaan bhi hai jo ise nahin maanate
 They say that there is no such language-family and all these different languages are being coerced into one group
 yah baat sabhi maanate hai ki in bhashaaon kii bahut si chizein aapas main milti hai
 The advocates of the Altai language family say that this is because they are all children of the same ancient primitive-altai language
 altaai bhashaa-parivaar ke virdohi kehete hai ki aisi koi bhashaa kabhi thi hi nahin or in bhashaa kii samantaayein isliye utpann hui kyonki inhen bolne waalon main aapasi mishran bahut rahaa he jis se inhone ek-dusre ko gahare rup se prabhavit kiya he
 Linguists believe that the primitive language from which this language family originated was spoken in the Altai Mountains of Central Asia
 isi se is bhashaa-parivaar kaa naam pad gaya he
 Mewar was the ruler of the Shishodia dynasty of Rajasthan
 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he

 sabhi chaahate the ki angrejon ko pataa chalanaa chaiye ki hindustani jaag chuke hai or unke hriday main aisi nitiyon ke prati aakrosh he
 To do so, he had planned to throw a bomb in Delhi Central Assembly
 bhagat singh chaahate the ki isamen koi khun kharaba na ho or angrejon tak unki 'awaz' bhi pahunche
 Although initially not everyone in his party thought so, in the end, the names of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt were unanimously chosen
 nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar 8 april 1929 ko kendriya asembli main in donon ne ek aise sthaan par bam phenkaa jahaan koi maujuud na tha, anyathaa use chot lag sakati thi

 At that time both of them were wearing khaki shirt and shorts

 Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and both were arrested

 His articles written during that time and letters written to his relatives are still mirrors of his thoughts

 He wrote that even if an Indian is the one who exploits the workers, he is their enemy

 Mahatma Gandhi spoke to the Viceroy on 17 February 1931 to pardon the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, then on 18 February 1931, on behalf of the general public, also filed an appeal before the Viceroy for forgiveness with various arguments
 yah sab kuch bhagat singh kii ichha ke khilaaf ho rahaa tha kyon ki bhagat singh nahin chaahate the ki unki sajaa maaf kii jaae
 On 23 March 1931, Bhagat Singh and his two companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged at around 7
33 pm in the evening
 phaansi par jane se pehle ve lenin kii jeevani pard rahe the or jab unase unki aakhri ichha poochi gai to unhone kaha ki vah lenin kii jeevani pard rahe the or unhen vah puri karne kaa samay diya jaae
 It is said that when the officials of the jail informed them that the time had come for their execution, they had said- "stop! First, meet one revolutionary other
 " phir ek minute baad kitaab chat kii ore oochaal kar bole - "thik he ab chalo
 " phaansi par jate samay ve teenon masti se ga rahe the - Fearing that no movement could erupt after the hanging, the British first sliced their dead bodies, then filled them in sacks and took them to Ferozepur where they were burnt by adding kerosene instead of ghee
 gaanv ke logon ne aag jalati dekhi to kareeb aaye
 Fearing this, the British threw half of their dead bodies into the Sutlej River and ran away
 jab gaanv vaale paas aaye tab unhone inke mrit sharir ke tukdo kon ekatrit kar vidhivat dah sanskaar kiya
 And Bhagat Singh became immortal forever
 iske baad log angrejon ke saath-saath gandhi ko bhi inaki maut kaa jimmevaar samajhane lage
 For this reason, when Gandhi was going to attend the Lahore session of the Congress, people welcomed Gandhiji with black flags
 ekaadh jagah par gandhi par hamalaa bhi hua, kintu saadi vardi main unke saath chal rahi police ne bachaa liya
 His thoughts are reflected from his letters and articles written during his jail time
 unhone bhartiya samaaj main lipi, jati or dharm ke kaaran aayi duriyon par dukh vyakt kiya tha
 He also thought of the attack of an Indian on the weaker section of society in the same manner as the atrocities committed by an Englishman
 bhagat singh ko hindi, urdu, punjabi tathaa angreji ke alaava bangla bhi aati thi jo unhone batukeshwar dutt se sikhi thi
 He believed that his martyrdom would cause the Indian public to become more agitated and this could hardly happen with his life
 isi kaaran unhone maut kii sajaa sunaane ke baad bhi mafinama likhane se saaf manaa kar diya tha
 Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil', in his autobiography, gave the guidelines, Bhagat Singh followed them literally
 unhone angrej sarkaar ko ek patr bhi likhaa, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki unhen angrezi sarkaar ke kilaaf bharatiyon ke yuddh kaa pratik ek yudhbandi samajha jaye tathaa phaansi dene ke bajaay goli se uda diya jaye
 In a letter sent to his brother Kulatar on March 3, before hanging, Bhagat Singh wrote - unhen yah fikr he hardam, nayi tarz-e-zafaa kya he? hamen yah shauk he dekhen, sitam kii intahaa kya he? Why should you be upset with the poison, what should be done of the wheel
 sara jahaan adu sahi, aao! muqaabala karen
 
 in joshili panktiyon se unke shaury kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 At the time of his first meeting with Chandrashekhar Azad, he swore that his life would be sacrificed for the country and he showed his promise
 “kisi ne sach hi kaha he, sudhaar buudhe aadmi nahin kar sakate 
 They are very intelligent and intelligent
 sudhaar to hote hai yuvakon ke parishram, saahas, balidaan or nishtha se, jinako bhaybheet hona aata hi nahin or jo vichaar kam or anubhav adhik karte hai 
 Bhagat Singh unki mrityu kii khabar ko lahore ke dainik tribune tathaa neuyork ke ek patr daily varkar ne chapa
 Even after this, many Marxist papers published articles on them, but since the arrival of Marxist letters in India was banned in those days, Indian intellectuals were not aware of this
 deshbhar main unki shahadat ko yaad kiya gaya
 In South India, Periyar wrote his article "why am i an atheist?" But he wrote an editorial in Tamil in the 22-29 March 1931 issue of his weekly paper Kudai Aarsu
 isamen bhagatsingh kii prashansa kii gai thi tathaa unki shahadat ko british samrajyavad ke upar jeet ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 Even today the people of India and Pakistan see Bhagat Singh as the lover of freedom who dedicated his life including his youth to the country
 unke jivan ne kai hindi filmon ke charitron ko prerit kiya
 The history of Kannada literature is about one and a half thousand years old
 kuch saahitiyik kritiyaan jo 9veen shatabdi main rachi gayin thim, ab bhi surakshit hai
 Kannada literature is mainly divided into three literary periods - ancient period, medieval period and modern period
 kannada sahitya kii ek vishesh baat yah he ki isamen jain, virshaiv or vaishnav teenon samradaayon ne sahitya rachana kii jisase madhyakaal main teen spasht dharaayen dikhti hai
 Although much of the literature before the 18th century was religious, some non-communal literature was also composed
 kannada sahitya ke itihaas par jitne chote-bade granth rache gaye hai unamem mukhya nimnlikhit hai : In these histories, the history of Kannada literature has been divided on different grounds
 kisi ne 12veen shatabdi ke madhyakaal tak jain yug, 12veen shatabdi ke madhyabhaag se 15veen shatee ke madhyabhaag tak "virshaiv yug", 15 veen shatabdi ke madhyabhaag se 19veen shatabdi ke purvardh tak "brahman yug" or uske baad ke kaal ko aadhunik yug mana he; or kisi vidvan ke anusaar aarambhkaal 10veen shatabdi tak, dharm-prabalya-kaal, ragale, shatpadi evam navinkal kaha he
 It can be said with certainty that in the annals of Kannada literature written so far, Dr
 R
S
 mughali kaa likhaa hua kannada sahitya charitre kai drushtiyon se sarvottam he
 Therefore, it can be said that the time division of Mughal is most valid which is as follows: pro mughali ne prayek yug ke sarvaadhik pratibhasampann kavi ke naam se us yug kaa namakaran karte hue mote taur par saare sahitya ko maarg yug, sankraman yug, deshi yug ke rup main vibhajit kiya he
 "kaviraj Marg" is the first available text of Kannada
 champu style main likhaa hua yah reetigranth pradhanthya dandi ke "kavyadarsh" par adhrith he
 Its creation is believed to be between 815-877
 is baat main vidwaanon main matbhed he ki iske rachayita manyakhet ke rashtrakut chakravarti swayan nripatung the yaa unka koi darbari kavi
 Dr
 Mugali is of the opinion that its author was the court poet Srivijay of Nrupatunga
 kavirajmarg kaa pratipaadya vishay alankaar he
 The book is divided into three passages
 dwitiya tathaa tritiy parichchhedon main kramash: shabdalankaron tathaa arthalankaron kaa nirupan udhaaharan sahit kiya gaya he
 The first approach envisages the conviction of poetry
 saath hi dhwani, ras, bhav, dakshini or uttari kavyapaddatiyaan, kavyaprayojan, sahityakar kii sadhana, sahityavimarsh ke swaroop aadi kaa sankshep main parichay diya gaya he
 Kaviraj Marg is a very important book in terms of Kannada language, Kannada literature, Kannada region, culture of the people of Karnataka, etc
 is kaal kaa doosraa granth he "vaddaradhane" jisamen 19 jain mahapurushon kii kahaniyaan gadhy main nirupit hai
 In relation to its author and composition, it is believed that a Jain poet named Shivkotayacharya composed it between 900-1070
 yah praakrit ke "bhagavatiaradhana" naamak granth ke aadhaar par rachaa gaya he or isamen uttam kavy ke gun milte hai
 The greatest importance of this book is that it gets the first form of Kannada prose
 uparyukt do granthon ke atirikt ab tak is kaal kaa anya koi granth uplabdh nahin hua he
 The period of the pump is particularly important in the history of Kannada literature, which is also known as the "golden Age"
 is kaal kaa doosraa naam he "jain yug", kyonki is avadhi main kannada sahitya kii shrivriddhi karanevaalon main jain mataavlambee kaviyon kaa vishesh haath rahaa
 Each of these Jain poets primarily composed two types of poetry - a Jain religious poem or an object of religious poetry was the story of a Tirthankara or great man, and cosmic poetry depicts the stories of mythological poems
 is prakaar do-do granth rachane kaa uddeshy ek or jain dharm ke tatwon kaa prachaar karnaa tha or duusari ore sanskrit ke lokapriy mahakavyon kaa kannada main praturup prastut karke logon ko apane dharm kii ore aakarshith karnaa tha
 These Jain poets were scholars of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages, were penetrating literature and were also talented poets
 in kaviyon ne aavashyak parivartan ke saath puranic kathankon ko apane dharm ke anukool avashya banaaya, kintu unki moulikta ko nasht na hone dekar rochakata ko banaae rakhaa
 The Kannada language and literature were greatly favored by the writings of Jain poets
 is avadhi main champu kavyastylee kaa vishesh prachaar hua
 In the religious poems of this time, the heroic and the rasad rasas were particularly expressive in the wonderful and quiet and temporal poems
 uparyukt do prakaar ke kaavyon ke atirikt chand, ras, alankaar, vyakaran, kosh, jyotish, vaidyak aadi vibhinn vishyon par bhi granth likhe gaye
 In this era, Kannada literature progressed as a whole
 is yug ke prasiddh kavi teen the–pump, ponn tathaa rann jo "rannatrayee" ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The Mahakavi pump or Adi pump composed two poems - "adipuran" and "vikramarajunvijay" or "pump India"
 adipurana main jinsenacharyakrit sanskrit purvapurana ke aadhaar par pratham tirthakar vrishabhnath kaa jeevancharit chitrit kiya gaya he or "vikramarjunvijay" main mahabharat ke kathanak kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Both of these are Champukavya
 pump kannada ke adikavi maane jate hai
 Their time is believed to be around 941 CE
 ponn pump ke samakaleen the
 He composed three texts - "shantipuran", "jinaksharamala" and "bhuvanaikaramabhyudaya"
 antim granth uplabdh nahin he
 Ranna's main compositions are two - "ajitpuran" and "sahas Bhimavijay" or "gadayudha"
 gadayuddh ke nayak bhim hai
 There is a unique euphemism of Veeras in Gadayudh
 isi kavy se rann kii rkiti achal hui he
 Other poets of the pump era include the names of Choundarai, Nagavarma, Durgasingh, Chandraraj, Nagachandra, Nagavarma etc
 choundary kaa "choundrayuparan" pracheen kannada gadhy kaa sundar namoona he
 Two texts of Nagavarma i have been received - "karnataka Kandabari" and "chhandombudhi"
 "karnatakakadambari" baan kii kadambari kaa kannada praturup he
 It is in the Champo style
 pro mughali kaa mat he ki kannada main anudit jitne granth hai unamem nagvarm kii karnatakakadambari sarvshereshth he–chandraraj or shridharacharya nagvarm ke samakaleen kavi hai
 Chandraraja's treatise on Madrasatilak and Madhutilak's astrological treatise called "jatakatilak" are both masterpieces
 isi kaal main durgasingh ne, jo bhagwat sampradaay ke kavi the, sanskrit "panchatantr" kaa anuwaad prastut kiya
 Between the 11th and 12th centuries another famous poet was named Nagachandra
 kyonki inhone panpabharat se prerana paakar ramayana kii rachana kii, isliye inkaa doosraa naam "abhinav pump" padaa
 Nagchandra also composed two poems like the earlier Jain poets - "mallinathpuran" and "ramachandrachitrapuran" or "pamparamayan"
 panparamayana hi kannada ke uplabdh ramakatha sambandhi kaavyon main sabase pracheen he
 The Mahakavis emerged in Pampyuga and enriched Kannada with their great works
 yadhyapi is kaal main bade-bade kalatmak praudh kaavyon kaa nirmaan hua, to bhi samaaj ke saadhaaran logon ke jivan ke saath sahitya kaa sampark nahin tha
 The main reason for this was that the poets of this time lived in the shelter of the kings and whatever they used to write, either to sing the fame of their shelter kings or to get the applause among other pundits of the court or their religion
 To promote
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki bolchaal kii bhashaa sahitya sarjan ke liye upyukt nahin samajhi gai
 Sanskrit was influenced everywhere
 champu style main jo praudh kavy rache gaye ve saadhaaran janata kii vastu na hokar panditon tak simit rahe
 The period from late 12th century to 15th century is called Basava era
 is yug kaa doosraa naam "krantiyug" he
 At this time, there was no such area in Karnataka, religious, social or political, which could remain untouched by the revolution
 is kranti ke unnayak basav, basavann athwa basaweshwar the, iliye is yug kaa naam basav yug padaa
 In this period, the above-mentioned Kannada literature was devised in place of Sanskritist Kannada and native verses were given special encouragement in lieu of Sanskrit poetry
 pichhali shatabdiyon main jain mataavalambiyon kaa sahityakshetra main sarvadhikaar tha
 In this era, different opinions contributed to the creation of literature
 sahitya kii shrivriddhi main bhakthi ek prabal prerak shakti ke rup main sahaayak hui
 Basaveshwara emerged in the second half of the 12th century
 unhone virshaiv mat kaa pun: sanghatan karke karnataka ke dharmik evam saamaajik jivan main badi uthal puthal machaai
 Basava and his followers used colloquial Kannada as a medium for propagating their views
 virshaiv bhakton ne bhakthi, gyaan, vairaygy, sadachaar evam niti par niraadambar style main apane anubhavon kii baaten sunai, jo vachan sahitya ke naam se prasiddh hui
 The words of these Veerashaiva devotees or Shiva Sharan are a type of prose
 shivasharanon ne sahitya ke liye sahitya nahin rachaa
 His main objective was to propagate his ideas
 unke vichaaron main saralata thi, sachaai thi or sachche jigyaasu kii rasmagnata tha
 Therefore, literary eloquence in his speech came automatically
 in shivasharanon ke vachanon ne karnataka main vahi kaary kiya jo kabir tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne uttar bharat main kiya
 Basava preached devotion and in the practice of this devotion, Vedic rituals, idolatry, discrimination of caste lines, avatarism, blind faith etc
 were hindered
 jatirahit, varnarahit, vargrahit samaaj ke nirmaan dwaara unhone aadhyatmik saadhan kaa maarg sarvasulabh bananaa chaha
 Among the contemporary Veerashaiva devotees of Basava are Allamprabhu, Akkamahadevi, chennai-bansava and Siddharam
 in vachanakaar shivasharanon ke atirikt virshaiv mataavlambee bahut se aise kavi hue jinhone bhakthibhavpradhan naanaa prakaar ke kavyagranth deshi chhandon kaa prayog karte hue prastut kiye
 The three best poets between the 12th and 13th centuries were Harihara, Raghavanka and Padmasaras
 is kaal ke jain kaviyon main nemichandra, bandhuvarma, jann, mallikarjun, keshiraj, rattakavi or kumudendu muni ke naam ullekhneey hai
 In the 13th century, the religious situation of Karnataka was again in turmoil
 ek ore karnataka ramanujacharya dwaara sthapit shrivaishnav sampradaay se prabhavit hua or duusari ore usamen madhwacharya ke dwait mat kii bhakthi kii nai lahar chali
 The Bhaktidhara run by these two Vaishnava sects brought new power to Kannada literature
 parinamswaroop puranic mahakavyon ke kathankon kaa kannada main nae sire se vishuddh mul rup main nirupan hua
 During this period, there was a Vaishnava poet named Rudrabhatta whose "jagannathvijay" is considered to be the first Vaishnav manag poetry of Kannada
 yah champu style main likhaa gaya he or isaki kathavstu krishna se sambandhit he
 The period from the 15th century to the end of the 19th century is called the Kumaravayas era
 is avadhi main vijaynagar ke samraaton tathaa mysore ke raajaaon ne kannada sahitya kii shrivriddhi main vishesh haath bantaya
 The reputation of Vaishnavism grew, whose response was also reflected in Kannada literature
 vaishnav dharm dwaara prachaarit bhakthi sahityasarjan main prerak shakti ke rup main prakat hui
 Literature came in very close contact with the public
 is kaal ke sarvshereshth kavi narnapp hai jo apni lokapriyata ke kaaran "kumarvyas" ke abhidhaan se prakhyat hue
 Kumaravas was the principal poet of the Bhagavata sect
 narnapp athwa kumarvyas kii janmatithi, janmasthan tathaa unke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 According to Prof
 Mughali, Kumaravas were alive between the 14th and 15th centuries
 kumarvyas ne "kannada bharat" athwa "gadugin bharat" or "airavat" naamak do kavy likhe the, aisa mana jaataa he
 But doubts have been expressed about Airavat being his masterpiece
 "kannada bharat" main vyasarchit mahabharat ke pratham das parvo kii katha kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Although Pampa had presented a Kannada model of the whole story of the Mahabharata through his "pampaharata", it could not become as popular as the Kannada Bharata of Kumaravayas
 iske do kaaran hai– ek yah he ki panpabharat main paandityapradarshan kii pravriti adhik thi or doosraa yah ki usamen jain dharm kaa rang bhi chadha tha
 After the kannada-bharata of Kumaravayas, many of the best poems were presented in the Shaktadi style based on the stories of Mahabharata, Ramayana and Bhagavata
 kumarvyas ke dikhalaae hue maarg par chalakar narhari athwa kumaravalmiki naamak kavi ne valmiki ramayana ke aadhaar par kannada main "torveramayana" kii rachana kii
 It is also a devotional treatise poem, which is a succulent artwork of ancient Kannada
 bhagwat mataavlambee kaviyon main timmann kavi, chatu vitthalanath, lakshmish tathaa nagaras ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Inspired by the Kumaravyas, the Timman poet described the story of the last eight festivals of the Mahabharata in his poem titled "krishnaraja Bharat"
 sabase pehle samgr bhagwat kaa kannada padyanuwaad chatu vitathalanath naamak bhagwat kavi ne prastut kiya
 Around this period, there was a very talented poet whose name was Lakshmish
 inkaa likhaa hua "jaiminibharat" anupam kavy he jisamen mahabharat ke katipay rochak prasangon kaa sundar evam marmasparshi varnan kiya gaya he
 Jaminibharat is the place in Karnataka after Kumaravyas India in terms of popularity
 nagaras naamak kavi ne bhagavadgita kaa "vasudevakthamritasar" naamak kannada padyanuwaad prastut kiya
 Just as the poets of the Bhagavata sect like Kumaravayas, Kumaravalmiki, Lakshmish practiced devotional management poems in Kannada by taking narratives from epics like Bharat, Ramayana, Bhagavata, similarly Madhavamatavali devotees colloquially composed songs, hymns, kirtans in Kannada The message of devotion was brought home to Karnataka
 in bhakton kii parampara kaa aarambh 13veen shatabdi main narharitirth dwaara hua tha
 At this time a large congregation of these devotees had gathered, which was mainly divided into two parts
 ek dal kaa naam tha "vyasakut" or duusare kaa "daskut"
 The difference between these two was that they were called Bhakt Vyasakutas who were mostly Brahmins and who considered Sanskrit suitable for the expression of their thoughts, and they were considered as Bhakta Daskut which included people of all castes and those who were Kannada Through bhajans, kirtans were composed
 sampradaay kii tatv sambandhi baton main "vyasakut" tathaa "daskut" ke bhakton main koi antar nahin tha
 Devotees of both these parties are famous in Karnataka as Haridas

 "hadivadeydharm" honnamma kaa ek sundar kavy he jisamen satidharm kaa pranjal bhashaa main varnan kiya gaya he
 The essence of Sankara's Advaita doctrine is presented in Saras Kannada in the "anubhavamrita" written by the Mahalingrang poet

 In this era, Veerashaiva Mtavlabi devotees and poets also served Kannada by creating various types of texts
 inamen kuch shatak style main likhe gaye hai
 Apart from the verse style, some prose texts were also written and verses like sangatya, tripadi, circle, champoo, song etc
 were specially used
 kintu is lambii avadhi main jitne vachanakaar hue ve ine gine hi hai
 Among the Veerashaiva poets who presented the Charitakavya were Chamaras, Virupaksha Pandits and Conspiracy Deities
 chamras ke likhe kaavyon main "prabhulingalile" shreshth charitkavy he
 Alluvum Prabhu's biography is expanded in "prabhulingalele"
 virshaiv kaviyon main shreshth prabandh kavy rachnewaalon main harihar ke baad chamras kaa naam aadar ke saath liya jaataa he
 The Chenabasava Purana written by Virupaksha Pandit is also an excellent poem, telling the story of the famous Veerashaiva devotee Chennasab

 In the Pampa era, Jain poets made champu style very popular in Kannada through their best management poems

 This style was adopted again in the Kumaravayas era

 bhartiya jivan ke itihaas main 19veen shatee kaa uttarardh atyant mahatvapurn he
 Since the whole of Indian life was disturbed and agitated by similar circumstances and influences at this time, it can be said that the story of the activity of modern Kannada literature is not different from the story of literature in other regional languages

 manushya ke vyaktitv kii mahanata tathaa uski pavitrataa par sarvatra aagrah dikhaai detaa he
 It was a new interview for writers that literature itself is an expression of individuality and attains perfection
 geet or niabandh, upanyaas or naatak ityadi bhi isi vyaktvaad se anupranit hue hai
 Realist writers have exposed the false beliefs and hollowness of social, political and religious institutions
 pragatisheel sahityakaron ne pradhanthya samaaj kii duvryavastha kii samasya ko macrsvaadi vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par hal karne kaa praytn kiya he
 Orthodox writers believe in the value of their well-founded faith
 lekhakon kaa ek varg vah he jisane kaavyatmak dharmik anubhutiyon kii sundar vyanjana kii he
 There are certain writers whose ultimate aim is a bold campaign in beauty
 lekhakon kii ek aastik dhara bhi he jisamen niti tathaa vichaarpurn darshaniktaa kii dhwani mukherit he
 The writers of this stream have a profound influence on the biography of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda and Arvind
 is dal kii kritiyon main buddhivaad or rahasyavaad, saundaryavaad or samaajwaad, karm or gyaan jaise paraspar virdohi tatwon, kaa samaahaar hua he
 Thus writers of diverse ideologies have decorated Kannada Bharati through various genres of literature
 in vibhinn vichaardhaaon se jis sahityasangam kii sristi hui he uske samashtirup main se ek maanavtaavaadi ujwal jeevandarshan prakashit hua he jiskaa kalantar main vyapak prabhaav avashya lakshith hoga
 The terminology or definition dictionary is a term for "glassery"
 "glassri" mulat: "glos" shabd se bana he
 "gloss" is a glossa from the Greek language whose initial meaning was "speech"
 baad main yah "bhashaa" yaa "boli" kaa vaachak ho gaya
 Later, it became more semantic and it was used for any kind of word
 aise shabdon kaa sangrah hi "glosri" yaa "paribhaasha kosh" he
 a list of words used in a particular genre of knowledge along with their definitions is called a technical glossary or a technical dictionary
 udhaaharan ke liye ganit ke adhyayan main aane vaale shabdon evam unki paribhaasha ko ganit kii paribhaashik shabdaawalee kehete hai
 The use of terminology makes the expression of complex ideas smooth
 mahaviracharya ne ganitsarasangrahah ke 'sangyadhikaar' naamak pratham adhyay main kaha he- After this, he has given the names and definitions of units of measurement of length, area, volume, time, gold, silver and other metals
 iske baad ganitiya sankriyaaon ke naam or paribhaasha di he tathaa anya ganitiya paribhaashaayen di he
 In bilingual terminology, synonyms of words of one language are given in another language and the definition of that word is also given
 arth kii drushti se kisi bhashaa kii shabdaawalee do prakaar kii hoti he- saamaanya shabdaawalee or paribhaashik shabdaawalee
 Words that are used in a certain sense in a particular field of knowledge are technical terms and words that are not used in a certain sense are common words
 prasiddh vidwaan acharya raghuveer bade hi saral shabdon main paribhaashik or saadhaaran shabdon kaa antar spasht karte hue kehete hai- To clarify the technical terms, many scholars have tried to define definitions in many ways
 dow raghuveer singh ke anusaar - Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari clarifies this in the editorial of 'translation' - shabdaawalee kii parampara "encychlopedia britnica" main tathaa anyatra bhi philatus se maani jaati he
 Their period was 3rd century BC
 is
 inhone "atakta" sheershak shabdaawalee sangruhit kii thi
 But in fact, the history of the vocabulary has gone backward and the oldest vocabulary found so far is that of the Hittite language, whose time is more than 1000 years before Christ
 bharat main pracheenatam shabdaawalee nighantu rup main milti he
 Due to the development in Sanskrit language, when Vedic proved to be difficult for Sanskrit people, collections of Vedic words were called "nighantu"
 aaj jo nighantu uplabdh he vah yaskacharya kaa he, kintu aise vishwaas ke paryaant pramaan hai ki yask ke samay main aise 4-5 or bhi nighantu the
 Yask's time in the 8th century BC It is assumed
 iskaa aashay yah hua ki pashchimi vidvan philtus kii jis shabdaawalee ko pracheenatam maanate hai vah bhartiya nighantuon se kam se kam 4-5 sau varsh baad kii he
 The terminologies that were initially collected in Europe were monolithic, but later the tradition of multilingual glossaries followed
 europe kii pracheenatam gyaat dwibhashik shabdaawalee latingreek kii he, jiske sangrahakarta philoxens maane jate rahe hai yadhyapi yah siddh ho chukaa he ki mulat: yah rachana unki nahin thi
 Its period is roughly 6th century AD
 yah ullekh he ki encychlopedia britnica aadi main ise pracheenatam bahubhashik shabdaawalee mana gaya he, kintu vastut: peeche jis hittit shabdaawalee kaa ullekh kiya ja chukaa he, vah dwibhashik hi nahin tribhaashik he
 Thus, the period of the oldest multilingual terminology is about one and a half thousand years behind the latin-greek
 1000 i
 ke aasapaas greek-latin latin-greek kii kai shabdaawaliyaan baniin
 The tradition of multilingual terminology in India is not very old
 amarkosh ke purv - jaise kaatya kaa "nammala", bhaguri kaa "trikand", amardutt kaa "amarmala" yaa vachaspati kaa "shabdarnav" aadi-evam baad ke - purushottam dev ke "haravali" tathaa "trikandkosh", halaayudh kaa "abhidhaan ratnamala", yadavaprakash kaa "vaijanti" aadi-kosh ekabhashik hi hai
 Prakrit Apabhransh - like Dhanapalarit "paiya Lachinamala", Hemachandra's "deshinamala" and Gopal, Drona etc
's native "kosh" and the old dictionary of Hindi - like Nandadas, Banarasidas, Badridas, Haricharan Das, Chetnavijaya, Vinayasagar etc
 Prayagadas etc
 The "shabdaratnavali" or Haricharanadasa's "karnabharana" etc
 - are in the same tradition, ie monolithic glossaries
 is parampara main kadachit antim granth suvansh shukla kaa "umravakosh" he
 In India, the tradition of glossaries of multiple languages begins with Muslims
 iskaa sabase prasiddh granth "khalikabaari" he, jisamen hindi, frarsi, turki ke shabd hai
 Many such texts were written in the Khalikbari tradition, the most famous of which is said to be the rich Khusra, though there is considerable controversy in this regard
 anek vidwaanon ke anusaar khalikabaari kisi "khusroshaah" kii rachana he, jo prasiddh kavi khusro ke bahut baad main hue the
 Shivaji also created a persian-sanskrit glossary of politics, which contained about 1500 words
 uske baad khalikabaari parampara main hindi-farsi ke kai kosh likhe gaye
 But in a scientific way, this work started after contact with the British
 europe main is disha main kaary ko vaigyanik str par laane kaa shrey je
 skellisar ko he
 The bilingual glossary of Henry Stephanes, published in 1573, is considered to be the first important work in this field
 bharat main angrej padariyon ne dharm evam rajprachaar kii drushti se yahan kii kai bhashaaon ke angreji kosh prakashit kiye
 From the point of view of Hindi, the first dictionary of this series J
 Ferguson's "A Dictionary of Hindustan Language" appeared from London in 1773 AD
 yah ullekhya he ki is parampara main hote hue bhi ye kosh shabdaawalee kii seemaa ke baahar hai
 Now the tradition of multilingual glossaries has developed a lot and glossaries of different subjects have been published here from 3-4 to 10-12 languages
 is disha main england, america, germany, france tathaa rus ne paryaapt shram kiya he
 The United Nations has also given yoga in this direction
 isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin ki shabdaawaliyon kaa hi vikaas koshon ke rup main hua he, kintu donon ek nahin hai
 The difference between the two is that there is a collection of words in one or more languages in the vocabulary, but the meaning or interpretation of the words in the dictionary is also there
 kala, vaanijya, vigyaan aadi ke vigyaan aadi ke vibhinn vishyon ke dwibhashik yaa bahubhashik koshon ke atirikt, paryaay evam vilomkosh bhi shabdaawaliyon kii hi parampara main aate hai
 The "nammala" literature of medieval Hindi literature refers to this
 ab paryaay koshon kii parampara badi vaigyanik ho gai he or lekhakon aadi ke liye ye bade upyogi siddh hue hai
 The work of compiling the first vocabulary after the tradition of medieval nomenclatures was created by Adam in 1829 under the title 'dictionary of the Hindu language' which contained 20,000 words
 tadbhav tathaa deshaj shabdon ko pradhanta di gai
 Adam Sahab was the first person who collected colloquial words from the people
 aadam se purv gilakraist, karkapetric, wiliam hunter, shakespeare, robak ke kosh or baad main failan, yet, dankar fors, thomson tathaa jon plats ke kaary ullekhneey hai
 Of these, the works of Phelan, Thomson and John Platts are important
 thomson ke sankalan main shabdasankhya 30,000 he, failan ke kosh main 1216 prishth hai
 The full name of the dictionary of plots is - "A Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi and English", whose main features are: bharatiyon dwaara banaaye gayi koshon main jin do koshon kaa sarvaadhik prachaar-prasar hua, ve hai - "shridhar bhashaa kosh', shridhar treepathi, lakhanu, prishth san
 744 tathaa 'hindi shabdaarth parijaat', dwarka prasad chaturvedi, elahabaad
 In the first dictionary there are about 25,000 word numbers while in the second there is more number of words due to the sufficient number of words of brajbhasha-awadhi etc
 divisions
 anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki 20ve shatabdi ke prarambh tak shabd sankalan 50,000 tak pahunch gaya
 In modern times, 'hindi Shabdasagar' was published from the Nagari Pracharini Sabha, Varanasi with the efforts of Babu Shyam Sundar Das, Ramchandra Shukla, Ramchandra Varma, whose plan was that of Shriut Reverend E
 Grebz, the supremely benevolent and enthusiastic member of the House of 23-8-1907
 The proposal was made in which it was prayed that "the assembly should take on the burden of a large and all-important dictionary of Hindi"
 san 1910 ke aarambh main shabd sangrah kaa kaary samaapt hua
 10 lakh slips were created, of which about one lakh words were estimated
 yah kosh vastut: sagar tha jo shabdon, arthon, muhaavaron, lokoktiyon, udaahranon tathaa uddharanon se bharpoor arthchhataayen dene main sarvottam mana jayega
 iske baad kosh kala main dirghakaalin anubhav praapt acharya ramachandra verma ke prayaason se varanasi se 'pramanik hindi kosh' prakashit hua
 The third edition of 'grand Hindi Dictionary' has one lakh forty eight thousand words
 is bich 'hindi shabdhsagar' kaa naveen sanshodhit or parivardhit sanskaran main prakashit hua jisamen kul prishth san
 5570 he, sanyojak shri karunapati treepathi ke dinaank 18-2-65 ke vaktavy ke anusaar "mul shabd sagar se isaki shabd sankhya main duguni vruddhi hui he
 "thus the number of vocabulary based on the dictionary is two lakhs
 pracheen bharat main hi darshan, jyotish, ganit, ayurveda aadi kuch vishyon main prachur bhartiya shabdaawalee uplabdh thi
 The actual work of establishing synonyms and developing standard language for established terminology was possible in India through Nagari Pracharini Sabha, Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Bengal Sahitya Parishad, Gurukul Kangri University, Osmania University, Hindustani Culture Society etc
 san 1898 i
 main nagari prachaarini sabha ne 'hindi scientific grassri' naamak paribhaashik kosh ko taiyaar karnaa prarambh kar diya tha, jo san 1901 i
 main sampann ho gaya tha
 In this direction, the work of Dr
 Satyaprakash and Dr
 Raghuveer is particularly notable
 uske baad lagbhag chaar dashak baad san 1940 i
 main sukhsampatiraay bhandari kaa 'tvintieth century english-hindi dictionari' chhapakar logon ke saamne aayaa or aazaadee ke baad san 1951 i
main dow raghuveer kaa ‘a compreehensive english-hindi dictionari’ prakashit hua
 Dr
 Raghuveer's thesis work was highly praised on the one hand and highly criticized on the other
 In fact, it was a commendable work, which was presented on a scientific basis with much labor
 sampoornat: sanskrit par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran isaki vyaavhaarikta par andeh kiya jane laga
 unhone sarvapratham bhashaa-nirmaan main yantrikta tathaa vaigyaniktaa ko sthaan diya
 Millions of words can easily be formed by the addition of prefixes and suffixes of metals: is prakriya ko kosh kii bhoomika main samajhaayaa
 yadi maatr do sambhavit yoga len, mulaansh 400 or teen pratyay len to 8000 rup ban sakate hai, jabaki abhi tak maatr 340 yogon kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 Here the amazing ability of word-making is revealed
 unhone vistaar se udhaaharan dekar samajhaayaa ki kis prakaar gam dhaatu maatr se 180 shabd sahaj hi ban jate hai
 Progress, regression, progress, regression, failure, learning, degeneration, overgrowth, aggravation, fall, fall, progress, origin, numbness, consistency, xxwrep 5 fall, progress, decline, speed, destination, priceless, countable, singular, Jangam, gaamyaman, gatwar, gaamnika etc
 are some examples
 maatr 'i' dhaatu ke saath vibhinn ek athwa do upsarg jodakar 107 shabdon kaa nirmaan sambhav he
 He clarified that millions of words can be formed with the sum of 20 prefixes and 80 suffixes with 520 metals
 agar dhaatuon kii sankhya badha lee jaae to 1700 dhaatuon se 23800 moulik tathaa 84,96,24000 shabdon ko vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus Sanskrit has an amazing ability to form words, which has been used only nominally
 ativaadee drushti se bachakar bhi lakhon aise saral shabdon ko prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he, jo hindi kii pravriti ke anukool hai
 Internationally accepted and previously accepted scientific terms should be accepted
 prayog ke aadhaar par kuch shabd purna paribhaashik, kuch ardhaparibhaashik, jaise akshar, sangati, aapatti
 aitihaasik aadhaar par tatsam, tadbhav ke saath videshi shabdaawalee kaa vishesh mahatva he
 Main article Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology swatantraaa ke baad vaigyanik-takneekee shabdaawalee ke liye shiksha mantralay ne san 1950 main board kii sthapana kii
 In 1952, the construction of vocabulary started under the auspices of the Board
 antat: 1960 main kendriya hindi nideshaalay kii sthapana hui
 Thus the terminology prepared on various occasions was published under the title 'definitive Vocabulary', which on the one hand was intended to provide the basis for the coordination work of the Commission on Scientific and Technical Terminology and on the other hand the writers were unanimous for new concepts in the interim period
 The term was to be provided
 aaj is bhagdaud ke yug main har aadmi kii yah aadat banati ja rahi he ki kam se kam samay main kam se kam shabdon main apane man ke bhaavon ko abhivyakt kare
 is swaabhaavik pravriti ke falswaroop hi sansthaaon tathaa sanghathanon ke lambe-lambe naam sankshipt hote ja rahe hai
 This new type of vocabulary is referred to in English as 'acronym'
 prayek kaal main aise shabd banate rahe hai
 In time, when these words become overused and make their proper place under the dictionary, they often forget that they must have been formed by this method, such as English 'news'
 The words 'badi' and 'sudi' which are prevalent in Hindi are also the result of this process, 'S' Sudi: Sufficient words in English like Anktad, Sam, Meadow, Seeto, Intak, NATO, UNESCO etc
 belong to this category
 pichhali baar china ke akraman ke samay nefa, mig tathaa radar teen shabd kaafii prachlit ho gayi
 'lesser', 'mig' are prevalent in war, 'prince' and 'pert' are similar words in management
 hindi patrakarita main prachlit annia, urvasi, upusi, inkaa, lod isi prakaar ke shabd hai
 a dialect has an integral relationship with folk life
 boliyon kaa hi parishkrut, samanyikrut tathaa sanskrit rup bhashaa he
 Language is the only power derived from dialects
 ganga kaa adirot himakhandon se nirmit gomukh he, usee prakaar hindi kii ganga ko uski boliyon se sarabhoot tatva tathaa pranashakti milti he
 Collecting words from practical lingua franca is not a simple task
 lokboli ke sthaayee tatva loakgeet tathaa lokkahaniyon main samahit rahete hai
 Folk life has a special importance in determining the source of word forms and the tradition of their development as well as the chain of meaning development
 boliyon main jab koi boli shikshit logon ke mukhya nagar yaa anya shisht saamaajik varg kii bhashaa ke pad par pratishthit ho jaati he tab vah maanak bhashaa kehalaati he
 Prof
 Ferguson has thought deeply about which language is considered to be developed and developing
 likhit rup main praapt jis bhashaa main nimnlalikhit visheshtaayen hon vah bhashaa viksit maani jaaegi - Hindi meets this criterion
 haan, unhone jo aage kii avasthaaen sweekaar kii hai ki From that point of view, Hindi is a developing language right now and in the future it has eternal possibilities
 hogan ne viksit bhashaa ke jo chaar tatva sweekaar kiye hai unamem se 'aadhuniktaa' par vishesh bal diya he
 'modernity of language' means: increase in vocabulary and development of new styles and expressions
 is kasuti par bhi hindi khari utarati he
 The famous poet and thinker of Hindi Sachchidanand Hiranand Vatsyayan believes that "language is Kalpavriksha"
 jo usase asthaapurvak maanga jaataa he, bhashaa vah detii he
 Do not ask for anything from him because if he is not seen hanging from the tree, then Kalpavriksha also gives nothing
 " According to the twentieth century eminent linguist, Bloomfield vastut: bhashaa mulat: abhivyakti kii sanrachana tathaa shabdaawalee kaa sanyukt rup he jo paraspar sangumphit he
 Vocabulary goes on and on, new ones are being created, new meanings are added to the old words, like today, there is expression of all new meanings from adhram, advocate, inscription, candidate, last word
 hindi kii aaksharik sanrachana bhi badi sampann he
 The unprecedented potential of development is evident due to the ample space available in the asterisks
 'vyanjan swar-vyanjan deergh swar' saanche main yadi maatr 'k' tathaa 'l' vyanjan kramash: liye jaaen to 21 sambhav shabd ban sakate hai, jinamein se 19 sthaan rikt pade hue the
 In four of these spaces, the words Qila, Qila, Quli, Kila were easily absorbed

 In the Indian constitution, there is a system of 'enriching the word store of Hindi mainly from Sanskrit and secondly from other languages
