 june 1991 main james goseling ne apane kai set-top box pariyojnaon main se kisi ek pariyojna main upyog karne ke liye java bhashaa pariyojna ko prarambh kiya
 The name of this language was formerly oak, which was named after an oak tree outside Gosling's office
 iske baad iskaa naam green bhi padaa or ant main iskaa naam java padaa
 yah java naam krambaddh shabdon kii ek suchi main se liya gaya
 Gosling aimed to introduce a virtual machine and a language that is familiar with c / c ++ style methodology
 1995 main san ne java 1

 It promised "right Once, Run Anywhere", offering no-cost run-time on popular platforms
 paryaapt sudrudh or samanurupayogy suraksha prakat karte hue isane network or file acces ke pratibandhon ko anumati de di
 Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within webpages, and Java soon became well-known
 java 2 ke aagaman ke saath naye bhashaantaron main bahu akruti thi jo vibhinn prakaar ke platformon ke liye nirmit thi
 For example, J2EE targeted for enterprise applications and the most recent version J2ME for mobile applications
 J2SE targeted the standard version
 2006 main, vyaper ke uddeshy se san ne J2 ke naye varsano kaa naam badalakar kramash: java EE, java ME or java SE kar diya
 In 1997, Sun Microsystems sent a proposal to the ISO / IEC JTC1 Standards Committee to implement Java and later to ACMA International, but soon withdrew from the process
 java samudaay prakriya dwaara niyantrit java vastav main ek di phacto maanak bana hua he
 Despite its status as a software owner, Sun once provided most of the Java implementation at no charge
 Sun profited from Java by selling licenses to specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System
 Sun made a distinction between its software development kit and runtime environment); Primary differences include jre's lack of compilers, utility programs, and header files
 13 navambar 2006 ko, san ne GNU general public license ke sharton ke adheen adhikansh java ko swatantra or mukt strot software ke rup main release kiya
 On May 8, 2007, Sun ended the process, making all of Java's core code available under free software / free-source distribution terms, except for a small piece of code that Sun does not own
 java bhashaa ko nirmit karne ke paanch mukhya uddeshy the: Although most of Java's direct profits come from licensing and JCP subscription funds, some believe that Java is primarily a vehicle for hardware server promotion and / or sales of Solaris OS for Sun internally, and Sun's vice president Rich Green Said that Sun's ideal role for Java is similar to "evangelism"
 java kii ek visheshta vahniyata he, jiskaa matlab he ki java bhashaa main likhe gaye computer program kisi bhi hardware samarthit / oparating system plateform par samaan rup se kaary karata he
 This is achieved by compiling the Java language code, not from machine code, but from Java bytecode, - the instruction conforms to the machine signal but would be intended to be interpreted by a virtual machine written specifically for host hardware
 and-yuzars saamaanya taur par staneylon prayog mashin / yaa java aplates ke liye web broujar main java rantime envyranment kaa istemaal karte hai, jo unke swayan ke mashin par santhaapit he
 Standardized libraries provide a functional way to access host-specific features such as: graphing, threading and networking
 bitcode ko istemaal karne kaa sabase mukhya laabh he vahanta
 jo kuch bhi ho, bhashaantaran ke upree bhaag kaa matlab hota he ki bhashantarit programs hameshaa mul nishpadanyogy se sankalit programs se zyada dhire chalati hai or bure pradarshan ke kaaran java kii saakh ko nuksaan hota he
 Recently, with the introduction of several optimization techniques in JVM implementation, this problem has been reduced slightly
 san microsystems aadhikarik taur par java maanak sanskaran plateform Linux, Mac OS x or Solaris ke liye license detii he
 haalanki, purv main san ne Microsoft ko java license diya, license kii avadhi samaapt ho chuki he or iskaa phir se naveekaran nahin kiya gaya he
 Through a network of third-group vendors and licensees, alternative Java environments are available for it and other platforms
 java brands kaa upyog karne ke liye san kaa trademark license dridhtaapurvak kahata he ki sabhi kriyanvayan 'upyukt' ho
 This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft when Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI and JNI and had additional platform-specific features of its own
 san ne 1997 main abhiyog chalaaya or 2001 main 20 million dollar kaa bhugtan or saath hi saath san ke license kii sharto ko lagu karne kaa court kaa aadesh bhi paaya
 As a result, Microsoft did not run Java for long with Windows, and in recent versions of Windows, Internet Explorer cannot support Java applets without third-party control
 Sun and others provided a free Java run-time system for that and other versions of Windows
 java EE ranneeti ke liye plateform-swatantra java aavashyak he or yahaan tak ki kriryanvayan ko pramanit karne ke liye or sakht vaidhikaran jaruri he
 Using the embedded Java environment, this environment enables portable server-side applications such as web services, servlets and enterprise javabeans, as well as embedded systems based on osgi
 glassfish pariyojna ke dwaara san java EE praudyogiki kaa purna sanchalit, ekikrut mukt strot karyanvayan ke liye kaary kar rahaa he
 Sun also distributes a superset of JRE called Java Development Kit, which includes development tools such as Java Compiler, Javadoc, Jar and Debugger
 java program ke pradarshan kaa iske samatuly multah sankalit bhashaa main likhe gaye program se tulana karnaa kathin he kyonki java ke bitcode compiler kaa target plateform, java plateform hi he or bitcode JVM dwaara mashin code main yaa to bhashantarit kar diya jaataa he yaa sankalit kar diya jaataa he
 These two different approaches: static vs
 dynamic compilation and recompilation and comparing other generated scenarios are very difficult and different
 sankalit bhashaaon main likhe prograamon kii tulana main java main likhe prograamon kaa dhimaa hona or adhik memory kii aavashyaktaa hona ek visheshta rahi he
 However, the implementation speed of Java programs has increased rapidly with the advent of just-in-time compilation, additional language features that support improved code analysis, and self-optimization in Java virtual machines
 object jivan chakra main smriti kaa prabandhan karne ke liye java ek swachaalit kachra sangrahakarta kaa upyog karata he
 The programmer determines when the object will be created and the Java runtime has the responsibility to recover its memory once the object is no longer usable
 ek baar jab object kaa koi sandarbh baaki nahin rahata, tab agamya object sangraahak dwaara swatah mukt hone ke yogya ho jaataa he
 Something similar to a memory leak can persist if a programmer's code catches a reference to an object that is no longer needed, similarly when objects that are no longer needed are stored in a container that is still Is in use agar astitvaviheen object ke liye paddatiyon ko bulaayaa jaataa hai, ek "nal pointer excepshan" phenkaa jaataa he
 One idea behind Java's automated memory management model is that programmers reduce the burden of performing regular memory management
 In some languages, memory for object creation is allocated or explicitly allocated on the stack and reallocated from the stack
 har tarah se smriti prabandhan kii jimmedaari programmer ke saath rahati he
 If the program does not reallocate an object, a memory leak occurs
 agar kaarykram smriti kaa abhigaman yaa punah aavantit karne kaa prayaas karata he jo pehle hi punahavantit kiya ja chukaa he, tab parinaam kaa anumaan lagaana or vyakhya karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he or kaarykram sambhawatah yaa to asthir or / yaa to samaapt ho jaataa hai
 This can be partially rectified using smart signals but it increases overhead and complexity
 kachra sangrahan kisi bhi samay ho saktaa he
 Ideally this will happen when the program is empty
 agar nae object ko aavantit karne ke liye swatantra smriti aparyaapt he tab iskaa chalaaya janaa nishchit he, yah kshambhar ke liye ek kaarykram sthapit karne kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Explicit memory management is not possible in Java
 java c / C++ style suchak ankaganit ko samarthan nahin karata he, jahaan par object adress or achinhit intigers ko adla-badali karke upyog kiya ja saktaa hai
 This allows the garbage collector to move the referenced objects and ensure its safety and security
 jaisaa ki C++ or kuch duusare object-unmukh bhashaaon main, java ke parivartaneey praathmik prakaar object nahin he
 The utility of the primary types is stored either directly in the fields or on the stack and not on the stack, as is generally true for objects
 java ke dijainron dwaara pradarshan ke kaaran liya gaya yah ek sajag nirnay tha
 Because of this, Java was not considered a pure object-oriented programming language
 jo kuch bhi ho, jaisaa ki java 5
0, swatah sanchaalan programmers ko aage badhane ke liye sakasham banaata he agar praathmik prakaarein unke aavaran shreniyon ke udhaaharan hote hai
 The syntax of Java is mostly derived from c ++
 C++, jisamen banaavat, kriyavidhi or kaarykram vaakya vinyas ko jodatii hai usase alag java ko keval ek object-unmukh bhashaa ke rup main banaaya gaya tha
 All the code is written within a class and everything is an object; Except for types of intrinsic data, which are not classes for performance reasons
 java kai visheshtaon ko claason ke liye, chhupaati he aisa vah bhashaa ko saral banane or swaabhaavik trutiyon or anadarsh rachana ko rokane ke liye karti he
 Java uses a review method similar to c ++

 It should be compiled into a bytecode using the Java compiler, first by producing a file named helloworld
class
 uske baad hi ise karyanvit yaa "nishpadit" kiya ja saktaa he
 The Java source file may contain only one public class but may contain fewer multiple classes than public access and any number of public inner classes
 ek class jise private ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he, use kisi bhi 
java file main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file
 class file kaa naam class kaa naam he, 
class sanlagnit ke saath
 class file peedhee ke liye, namarahit claason is tarah prabandhit hoti hai jaise ki unka naam unke sanlagnit class ke naam kaa sangyojan tha, ek $, or ek purnank
 The key word public indicates that a system can be invoked by code in other classes, or classes can be used by classes outside the class hierarchy
 class padanukram nirdeshika ke naam se sambandhit hota he jisamen java file rahata he
 The key word next to a system static refers to a positional system that is only associated with the class, not any other specific instance of that class

 Positional systems cannot access any variable system that is not static

 The system name "main" is not a key word in the Java language
 yah sirf pranali kaa naam he jise java nirmaataa kaarykram ko niyantran badhaane ke liye bulaata he
 Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and enterprise Java beans do not require or use the main system
 a Java program can contain multiple classes that have main systems, which means that the VM must be explicitly telling which class to launch from

 Thomas Heyer was a resident of England who mentioned this system in detail in his two books namely Machinery of Government and Treatise on the Election of Representatives
 or jab jaan stuart mil ne apni pustak 'riprexantative government' main is prastut pranali kii "rajyashastra tathaa raajnneeti main sabase mahatvapurn sudhaar" kahkar prashansa kii tab vishwa ke raajnneetigyon kaa dhyaan isi ore aakrisht hua
 Various changes have been made from time to time in the fundamental organization of the tumor hair
 anupatik pratinidhitiv vibhinn roopon main apanaaya gaya he, tathaapi in sabamein ek samanta avashya he, jo is pranali kaa ek anivaary ang bhi he ki is pranali kaa prayog bahusadasy nirvachankshetron ke bina nahin ho saktaa
 There are two main forms of proportional representation system, ie list system and single transitive system
 suchipranali kuch her pher ke saath europe ke adhiktar deshon main prachlit he
 Generally, lists of various political parties are given members according to the votes they have received under this system
 is pranali kii vyakhya sabase uttam rup se germany ke 1930 ke vimar vidhaan ke antargat german sasand ke nimna sadan rishtag kii nirvachan paddati se kii ja sakati he jise baden aayojana ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 According to this plan, the total number of votes cast was not fixed, but the number of votes cast in the election was fluctuating
 prayek 60,000 maton par, jise kota kehete the, ek pratinidhi chunaa jaataa tha
 Germany was divided into 35 constituencies and combined into 17 constituencies
 prayek raajnneetik dal ko teen prakaar kii suchiyaan prastut karne kaa adhikaar tha : sthaneey suchi, pradeshy suchi tathaa rashtriya suchi
 Each voter used to give his vote to some political party by not giving it to the representative
 prayek nirvachan-kshetra main matganana ke uparaant prayek raajnneetik dal ko sthaneey suchi ke upar pratham ummidavaar se utane pratinidhi de die jate the jitne kul praapt maton ke anusaar kota ke aadhaar par milen; taduparant prayek pradesh main sthaneey kshetron ke shesh maton ko jodakar phir prayek dal ko pradeshy suchi se vishesh sadsy de die jate he or isi prakaar saare pradeshy kshetron main shesh maton ko phir jodakar rashtrasuchee se kota ke anusaar vishesh sadsy or isapar bhi yadi shesh mat rah jaaen to 30,000 maton se adhik par ek vishesh sadsy us dal ko or mil jaataa tha
 Thus the Baden system followed the principle of proportional representation that "no vote should go in vain" to its logical conclusion
 is pranali kii sabase badi kami yah he ki matadaataaon ko pratinidhiyon ke chunaav main vyaktigat swatantraaa nahin hoti
 According to the single transferable vote or hair system, the election of the delegates is done by the general list, at the time of election, every voter writes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 etc
 according to their interest in front of the candidates name
 gananaa se pratham charan kota kaa nishkarsh karnaa he
 The total number of votes cast to achieve the quota is added by adding one to the number of fixed members of the constituency, and then adding one to the result, namely: sabase pehle un ummidavaaron ko nirvaachit ghoshit kiya jaataa he jo kota praapt kar lete hai
 If it does not fill all the seats, then votes in excess of the quota of pre-elected members are distributed according to their interest in their voters
 yadi isapar bhi sthanon kii purti nahin hoti, tab kam se kam mat paae hue ummidavaar ke maton ko jab tak baantate rahete hai jab tak kul sthanon kii purti nahin ho jaati
 It appears from experience that the single transferable system provides freedom to the electorate and representation to each group by number
 isaki yah bhi visheshta he ki raajnneetik dal nirvachan main anuchit laabh nahin uthaa sakate, parantu aalochakon kaa kahana he ki yah nirvachan saamaanya matadaataaon kii buddhi se pare he
 Proportional representation has been promoted very quickly due to its properties
 pratham mahayuddh ke pehle bhi europe ke bahut se deshon main suchipranali kaa loksabhaa ke nirvachan main adhiktar prayog hone laga tha
 In Denmark it was only in 1855 that its use for the election of the High House of Parliament started
 taduparant 1891 main switzaraland ne pradeshik sansadon ke liye ise apanaaya or 1895 main belgium ne sthaneey chunaavon ke liye tathaa 1899 main sansad ke liye
 Sweden in 1907, Denmark in 1915, Holland in 1917, Switzerland in 1918 and Norway in 1919 fully implemented the system for all elections
 pratham mahayuddh ke uparaant europe ke samast nae vidhaanon main kisi na kisi rup main anupatik pratinidhaan ko sthaan diya gaya
 a single transitive system is used mostly in English speaking countries
 britain main yah pranali 1918 se parlment ke vishvavidhyalayon ke pratinidhiyon ke nirvachan main istemaal hoti rahi he or england ke girje kii rashtrasabha ke liye, scotland main 1919 se shiksha sambandhi sansthaaon ke liye, uttari ireland main 1920 se parliment ke donon sadanon ke sadasyon ke chunaav ke liye
 According to the legislation of Ireland, all elections are conducted through this system
 dakshini africa main iskaa prayog sinet tathaa kuch sthaneey chunaavon main hota he
 Local elections are also held in Canada on this basis
 sanyukt rajya, america main abhi tak is pranali kaa prayog sthaneey chunaavon ke atirikt anya chunaavon main nahin ho paaya he
 The Second World War carried this movement forward; For example, the Fourth Republic Legislation of France replaced the General List in its electoral law
 taduparant ceylone, burma or indonesia ke nae vidhaanon ne ekal sankramntic matpranali ko apanaaya he
 In India, almost all elections under Public representation-acts and Rules are conducted by single transferable ballot system
 anupatik pratinidhaan pranali ke paksh or vipaksh main bahut se tark vitark die ja sakate hai
 There is no doubt that if implemented in real terms from a theoretical and practical point of view, then it can achieve success in its purpose
 nihsandeh yah samaaj ke sabhi pramukh samoohon ke pratinidhitiv kii raksha karti he
 In countries where there are ethnic and social minority groups, this system has special significance
 aalochakon kaa yah kathan ki yah pranali uljhi hui he, kuch tarkyukt nahin prathit hota
 Firstly, this system is itself a means of political education and as far as confusion and asymmetry is concerned, it can be overcome by the appointment of skilled and competent officer
 anupatik pratinidhaan kii ek aalochana yah bhi he ki yah raajnneetik dalon kii sankhya main vruddhi ko protsaahan detii he, parinamswaroop sansad main kisi ek dal kaa bahusankhyak hona kathin ho jaataa he, jisase adhikansh mantrimandal sanyuktadaleey tathaa falswaroop asthaayee hote hai
 But this argument seems unfounded by the political experiences of countries such as Belgium and Switzerland, because the political party of a country does not depend on the electorate of that country as much as on the social, economic, religious, ethnic, language and political conditions of that country

 fiqh islamic dharamshastra ko kaha jaataa he
 Fiqh has its impact on every aspect of Islamic life for Muslims
 jabaki shariat us samucchy niti ko kehete hai
 Which is based on Islamic legal, traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 fiqh islamic nyaayashastra ke liye shabdaawalee he, jo islamic nyayavidon ke faislon se bana he
 The basic component of Islamic studies, Fiqh elaborates on the method by which Islamic law has been drawn out of primary and secondary sources
 islamic nyaayashastra kaa itihaas "prathanusaar aath avadhiyon main vibhajit" kiya gaya he
 The sources of Fiqh in order of importance are: koran kai muddon par spasht nirdesh detaa he jaise ki anivaary dainik prarthana se pehle shuddhikaran anushthan kaise karen, lekin anya muddon par, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa hai ki akele koran hi chijen spasht karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 For example, according to the Qur'an — during the month of Ramadan, one needs to engage in daily prayers and fasting but Muslims believe they need more instruction on how to perform these duties
 in muddon ke bare main spashtikaran paighmbar mohammad kii paramparaon main paaya ja saktaa he, isliye adhikansh maamalon main daleelein koran or sunnat kaa aadhaar hai
 Some subjects in the early period of Islam are without precedent
 In those cases, Muslim jurists try to come to conclusions in other ways
 sunni nyayavid samudaay kii aitihaasik sahmati kaa prayog karte hai; aadhunik yug main adhikansh nyayavid bhi saadrishy or nae vishyon ke nafaa or nuqasaan kii tulana kaa upyog karte hai
 With the help of these additional tools, a wide array of laws are formed according to Sharia and this is called Fiqh
 is prakaar, sharia ke saamne, fiqh ko pavitra nahin mana jaataa he, or 'vichaar-prakriya ke vidyalayon' ke tafasilaat par anya nishkarshon ko pavitraapurna rup main bina dekhe hi asmaan vichaar hai
 This division of interpretation into more elaborate issues has resulted in different schools of thought process
 This broad concept of Islamic jurisprudence is the source of many laws in various disciplines that direct Muslims in everyday life
 shariat kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqh yaa fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen mazahab kehete hai
 The main denominations in Sunni Islam are: adhiktam musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron mazahab buniyadi taur par sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he

 yah seemaa taap or, gaison kii dasha main, dabaav par bhi nirbhar karti he
 The salt in which no more salt can dissolve in the solution, we call it a saturated solution of salt
 jis vilyan main or namak ghul jaataa he, use asantrupt vilyan kehete hai
 Sometimes we can dissolve some solids in such a quantity that if their volume in the solution is more than the amount present in the saturated solution, then such solution is called superintelligent solution
 atisantripta vilyan saamanyat: asthaayee hote hai or kisi vishisht paristhiti main hi banate hai
 More soluble solids can be separated from it at any time
 ghulanevaale padaarth ko viley or ghulaanevaale padaarth ko vilya kehete hai
 When gases or a solid dissolve in a liquid, then the liquid is called solvent and the gas or solid is called solute
 jab ek drav duusare drav main ghulata he, tab adhik matraavaale drav ko vilaayak or kam matraavaale drav ko viley kehete hai
 There are two types of solvent: one is called polar and the other is called non-polar

 Various types of substances like alkaloids, chlorophyll, penicillin, oil, etc
 are extracted from natural sources only through solvents
 yadi do gaison ko ek duusare ke sampark main laayaa jaae, to uske do parinaam ho sakate hai : If the gas is exposed to the fluid, the gas dissolves in the liquid at a specific temperature and pressure to form a saturated solution
 kuch gaisen, jaise ammonia, yaa hydrogen chloride, jal main bahut adhik ghulti hai or kuch gaisen, jaise nitrogen, yaa oxigen, jal main kam ghulti hai
 The solubility of gases depends on the nature of the gases, the nature of the solvents, the heat and pressure, as shown in the table below: upar kii sarini se spasht he ki unche taap se gaison kii vileyata kam ho jaati he or adhik dabaav se vileyata bad jaati he
 Carbon dioxide remains more soluble at higher pressures in the sodawater bottle, and at the opening of the bottle, more dissolved gas is released by bubbling when the pressure is reduced

 We call them mixed
 ve hi drav mishraneey drav hote hai, jinamein paraspar rasayanat: samanta hoti he
 There are some liquids that do not dissolve in each other, such as mercury and water, water and benzene
 inhen ham amishraneey kehete hai
 There are some liquids which dissolve in each other and form two layers
 aise do drav jal or ether hai
 Two levels are formed by mixing water and ether

 But some water in the level of ether above and some ether in the level of below water also remains dissolved
 ye anshat: mishraneey drav hote hai or in donon staron ko sanyugmi str kehete hai
 Here, solubility also depends on heat and to some extent pressure
 dravon main thoson kii vileyata simit hoti he
 At each temperature only a certain amount of solids dissolves in the liquid

 Generally, many salts are soluble in water
 kuch lavan, jaise ammonium nitrate, jal main bahut vilayashil hai or kuch lavan, jais calcium sulphate, jal main alp viley hote hai
 When a solid dissolves in a liquid, heat is usually absorbed
 taap kii vruddhi se saamanyat: thoson kii vileyata bad jaati he, par isamen kuch apwaad bhi hai
 The solubility of calcium sulfate and calcium acetate is slightly reduced by the increase in heat
 yadi kisi thos kii vileyata ucch taap par adhik he, to crystalan dwaara us thos kaa shodhan kiya ja saktaa he
 By making a saturated solution at high temperature, frosting it, a large amount of solute crystals are separated and obtained in pure form

 The measure of concentration is known by the amount of gram-molecule-weight dissolved in a liter solution
 ise gram-anukta kehete hai
 Since the volume of the solution decreases with temperature and pressure, it is not suitable for displaying the concentration
 iske sthaan main gram aanwata kaa vyavhaar hota he
 This gram molecule shows how many grams of solute dissolved in 100 grams of solution
 yadi vilyan tanu he, to kisi vishisht viley or vilaayak ke liye gram anukta or aanwata vibhinn sandran ke liye ek duusare ke samaanupaat main hote hai
 The concentration of solutions in the analysis is represented by the normality
 normal vilyan ke ek litre main kisi viley kaa ek gramtulyank ghala rahata he
 Other concentrations of solutions are reported in normal, such as 2 normal, 5 normal 10 normal, tenth normal, millennial normal, etc

 Why not work by placing simple concrete type long girder on the walls to make big roof roofs? Why triangular scissors are made? The roofs of moderately small roofs can be made by placing a plain girder of the proper size, but the girder is very heavy and expensive if it is too long

 The change that results from the effect of stress is called distortion
 padaarthon main pratyasthata kaa gun hota he, kisi main kam or kisi main kam or kisi main adhik
 There is a limit of elasticity

 Testing of materials used in engineering is essential
 jis paristhiti main samagriyon kaa upyog hota he usee paristhiti main unako rakhkar, unka pareekshan karnaa chahie
 The test takes place in two ways: one has knowledge of the molecular organization of materials and is seen physically by pulling, pressing, shearing, punching, bending and turning to see how they are able to bear
 bhautik reeti se samagriyon kaa pareekshan karne ke liye aajkal ek yantra bana he jise hounfield tensometer kehete hai

 The ideology of scientific socialism propounded by Marx embodied the Russian Revolution for the first time
 is kranti ne samaajawaadee vyavastha ko sthapit kar swayan ko is vyavastha ke janak ke rup main sthapit kiya
 This ideology became so powerful after 1917 that by 1950 almost half of the world had come under it
 kranti ke baad kaa vishwa itihaas kuch is tareeke se gatisheel hua ki yaa to vah iske prasar ke paksh main tha athwa iske prasar ke viruddh

 The obvious result of this revolution was that it had introduced political rights to the common people of Russia

 By becoming familiar with their political rights, the people of Russia understood that a completely democratic regime should be established in Russia, where the rule of power is in the hands of ordinary people

 Outlining the limits of revivalism, he wrote in one of his articles that- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise Captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port

 Blood donation occurs when a healthy person gives his or her blood voluntarily and is used for transfusion or a drug is made through a process called fracation
 viksit deshon main, adhikansh raktadata avaitnaik swayamsevak hote hai, jo saamudayik aapurti ke liye rakt daan karte hai
 In poor countries, established supplies are limited and blood donors are usually given only when transfusion is needed for family or friends
 anek daata daan ke rup main rakt dete hai, lekin kuch logon ko bhugtan kiya jaataa he or kuch maamalon main paise ke bajaay kaam ke samay main savaitanaik chuttee ke rup main protsaahan die jate hai
 Any donor can donate blood for their future use
 rakt daan apekshaakrit surakshit he, lekin kuch daataaon ko us jagah kharonch aa jaati he jahaan sooyee daali jaati he yaa kuch log murchha mahasoos kar sakate he
 Potential donors are evaluated so that their blood use remains unsafe
 jaanch main echivi or viral hepatitis jaisi bimariyon ke pareekshan shaamil hai jo rakt-aadhaan ke jariye sankramit ho sakate hai
 The donor is also asked about his medical history and a brief physical examination is done to ensure that the donor does not have a damaging effect on the donor's health
 kitni baar ek daata daan kar saktaa he yah dinon or maheenon main bhinn ho saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar he ki vah kya daan kar rahaa yaa kar rahi he or kis desh main daan diya-liya ja rahaa he
 For example, a donor in the United States has to wait 8 weeks between full blood donations, but just three days for plateletpheresis donations
 die jane vaale rakt kii maatra or tareeke alag-alag ho sakate he, lekin ek adarsh daan puure khun kaa 450 millilitre hota he
 It can be stored manually or by automated equipment that only takes a specific part of the blood
 aadhaan ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale khun ke adhikansh ghatak kaa chota achal jivan hota he or lagaataar aapurti banaaye rakhana ek sthaayee samasya he
 Blood donation is divided into groups based on who will receive the collected blood
 ek allogenic daan use kehete hai jab koi daata kisi anjaan vyakti ke aadhaan liye blad bank main bhandaaran karne ke liye khun detaa he
 a guided donation is called when a person, often a family member, donates blood for the transfusion of a particular person
 nirdeshit daan apekshaakrit viral hote hai
 a replacement donor donation is a mixture of two and is common in developing countries such as Ghana
 is maamle main, sangrahit rakt kaa upyog aadhaan main prayukt rakt kaa pratisthaapan karne ke liye praptakarta kaa dost yaa paariwarik sadsy raktadan karata he taaki rakt kii nirantar aapurti sunishchit ho
 When a person's blood is collected and subsequently returned to the donor, usually after surgery, it is called autologous
 allogenic daan yaa phir dawa ke nirmaan ke liye vishesh rup se kiye janevaale daan se mili rakt kaa upyog dawa banane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The actual procedure varies according to the laws of the country and the recommendation for donors varies according to the different blood collecting organizations
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne rakt daan nitiyon kii anushansaaen pradaan kii he, lekin vikasshil desh inamen se kaiyon kaa paalan nahin kar rahe hai
 For example, the need for laboratory facilities, trained staff and specialist reagents have been recommended for testing, all of which may not be available or very expensive in developing countries
 aise kaarykram jahaan daankarta allogenic rakt dete hon, kabhi-kabhi yah rakt drive yaa raktadan satr kehalaata he
 Such programs can take place in a blood bank, but often these people organize it in a community place such as a shopping center, workplace, school or place of worship
 aamtaur par is puri prakriya ke liye daandaataaon ko sahmati dene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or is aavashyaktaa kaa matlab yah he ki naaballig apane mata pita yaa abhibhavak kii anumati ke bina daan nahin kar sakate
 kuch deshon main, pahchaan ko gumnaam banaaye rakhane ke liye, jawaab daankarta ke rakt se judaa hota he, na ki rakt daata ke naam se; lekin kuch anya deshon main jaise ki sanyukt rajya america main ayogy daataaon kii suchiyaan banane ke liye naam rakhe jate hai
 If a potential donor does not meet these criteria, they are delayed
 is shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he kyonki bahut saare daankarta jo ayogy hai baad main unhen raktadan kii anumati di ja sakati he
 The donor's race or ethnic background sometimes becomes important, as sometimes certain blood types, especially rare blood types, are very common in any ethnic group
 aitihaasik rup se, daankartaaon ko nasl, dharm yaa jaateeyata ke aadhaar par alag kiya gaya tha, lekin ab aisa nahin hota he
 Donors are tested for health risks because that donation may be unsafe for the recipient

 The safety of blood donation during pregnancy has not been properly studied, which is why pregnant women are usually denied
 agar rakt aadhaan ke liye prayog kiya janaa he to daata ke rakt ke prakaar ko jarur sunishchit karnaa chahie
 The collecting agency usually identifies the blood type A, B, AB, or o and the donor type and will be tested for antibodies to the rare antigen
 In addition, other tests, including crossmatch, are usually performed before transfusion
 
 group o aksar "saarvbhaum daata" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, par keval laal koshika ke aadhaan ke liye isaki sammati di jaati he
 For plasma transfusion, the system is reversed and AB becomes the universal donor
 adhikanshat: kuch astidi samet vibhinn bimariyon ke liye rakt kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 The test uses high-sensitive screening tests and there is no real diagnosis
 kuch pareekshan ke parinaam main baad main or bhi vishisht pareekshan kaa upyog kiye jane par ve farji ghanaatmak paye jate hai
 Fake negatives are rare, but donors are discouraged from donating blood due to unintentional ATD screening, because being a false negative means contaminating the unit

 Other different types of testing for transfusion transmitted infections are often used based on local requirements
 atirikt pareekshan mahangaa hota he or kuch maamalon main pareekshan kii laagat kii vajah se ise lagu nahin kiya jaataa he
 These additional tests also include other infectious diseases such as the West Nile virus
 prayek pareekshan kii simaaon ko dekhte hue kabhi-kabhi ek hi beemaari ke liye kai tarah ke pareekshan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 For example, HIV antibody testing will not detect a recently infected donor, so some blood banks use p24 antigen or HIV nucleic acid in addition to antibody testing to detect an infected donor during that period

 Viruses are not a threat to a healthy recipient, but they can harm newborns and other recipients who are weak in immunity
 daata se rakt praapt karne ke do mukhya tareeke hai
 Much of the blood is taken directly from the vein in the form of unchanged blood
 aam taur par is rakt ko alag bhaagon main, zyaadaatar laal rakt koshikaon or plasma main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kyonki adhik se adhik praptakartaaon ko keval ek ghatak vishesh kii jarurat hoti he
 Another way is to take blood from the donor, using a centrifuge or a filter to separate it and store the desired parts and return it to the rest of the donor
 yah prakriya aferesis kehalaati he or aksar yah kaam iske liye vishesh rup se taiyaar mashin ke jariye kiya jaataa he
 The vein is used for direct blood transfusion, but in turn blood may be taken from the artery
 is maamle main, rakt sanchit nahin kiya jaataa he, balki daata se sidhe praptakarta main pump kar diya jaataa he
 It is an old method of blood transfusion and is rarely used in today's times
 rasad or ghayal sainikon kaa ilaaj karke laute doctor jab naagarik jivan main laut jate hai tab sanchit rakt ke liye bank kii sthapana kii samasya ke kaaran dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan charanbaddh rup se ise band kar diya gaya
 Blood is taken from the vein closest to the skin of the long arm, usually from the median cell vein within the elbow
 The skin above the blood vessel is cleaned with an antiseptic, such as iodine or chlorhexidine, to prevent contamination of accumulated blood from the skin bacteria and to prevent infection from where the donor skin is applied
 chhedan ke bal ko kamatar karne ke liye ek badi sooyee kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, kyonki jab laal rakt koshikaayen sooyee se hokar bahati he to unako nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Sometimes a tourniquet is wrapped in the upper arm to accelerate this process and increase the blood pressure of the vein
 daata ko kisi vastu ko haath main pakadaney yaa mutthi ko kasate rahane ke liye bhi kaha ja saktaa he, aisa baar-baar karne se shira main rakt pravaah tej hota he
 The most common method is to collect blood from the donor vein in a container
 kisi desh ke aadhaar par nishkasit rakt kii maatra 200 millilitre se 550 millilitre tak hoti he, lekin aamtaur par 450-500 millilitre tak hoti he
 Blood is usually stored in a flexible plastic bag, which contains sodium citrate, phosphate, dextrose, and sometimes adenine
 yah sangyojan bhandaaran ke dauraan rakt ko thakke banane se bachaata he or sangrakshit rakhata he
 Other chemicals are sometimes added during processing
 aparivartit rakt se plasma kaa istemaal aadhaan ke liye plasm banane main kiya ja saktaa he yaa fracshnation karke prasanskaran kar iskaa istemaal anya aushadhi banane main kiya ja saktaa he
 Dried is an evolved form of plasma, which was used to treat wounds during World War II, and its variant is still used to make a variety of drugs

 saamaanya ekal daan or aadhaan ke liye shwet rakt koshika ko ikattha karne kii tulana main aferesis kaa bhi zyada istemaal laal rakt koshikaayen ikattha karne main hota he
 Donors are usually kept in the donation site for 10–15 minutes after donation, as the most adverse reactions occur during donation or immediately after donation
 rakt centre aamtaur par aarogy laabh ke liye daata ko chaay or viscuit jaisi halki-fulki vasteen khaane-pine ko dete hai yaa dopaher ke bhojan ke liye bhatta pradaan karte hai
 The dipping site is covered with bandage and the donor is instructed to keep the bandage tied for several hours
 daan diya gaya plasma 2-3 dinon ke baad waapas de diya jaataa he
 Red blood cells are slowly replaced in the circulatory system by bone marrow on average 36 days in healthy adult males
 us adhyayan main aarogy laabh kii seemaa 20 se 59 din thi
 The rate of such replacement depends on how often the donor can give blood
 plazmaferesis or plateletferosis daata baar-baar de saktaa he, kyonki unamem ati mahatvapurn laal rakt koshikaon kii maatra kam nahin hotin
 daata kitni baar daan de saktaa he, iskaa sateek dar alag-alag deshon main bhinn hota he
 For example, in the United States, plasmapheresis donors are allowed to donate large amounts twice a week and can normally give 83 liters a year, while the same donor can donate once every alternate week in Japan
 And can donate 16 liters a year
 aparivartit rakt daata ke liye laal rakt koshikaayen simit hoti he, isliye daan kii aavriti ko vistrut antar hota he
 In Hong Kong it is made in three to six months, in Australia it is twelve weeks, in the United States it is eight weeks, and in Britain it is usually sixteen weeks, but it can be less than twelve
 daataaon ke swasthya samasyaon kii jaanch kii jaati he, taaki gambhir jatiltaaon ke kaaran daan unhen jokhim main na daal de
 First-time donors, adolescents and women are at greater risk of reaction

 These include puncture in the artery, prolonged bleeding, muscle irritation, nerve injury, vein lesions, thrombophlebitis, and allergic reactions
 rakt ko thakka banane kii aferesis sangrah kii prakriya main kabhi-kabhi daataaon ko sodium citrate ke prayog se pratikul pratikriya ho jaati he
 Since anticoagulants with unabsorbed blood components return to the donor, it can bind calcium and cause hypocalcemia
 in pratikriyaaon se hothon main jhunjhuni ho sakati he, lekin anthan yaa adhik gambhir samasya bhi paidaa ho sakati he
 To prevent this side effect, donors are sometimes given calcium supplements during blood donation
 afferosis prakriyaaon main, laal rakt koshikaayen aksar laut aati hai
 If this is done manually and the donor receives blood from a different person, then a transfusion reaction may occur
 is jokhim ke kaaran viksit vishwa main minial afferosis bahut hi durlabh he or swachaalit prakriyaayein puure rakt daan jaisi hi surakshit hai
 The ultimate risk for blood donors are devices that have not been sterilized

 There are no storage measures to keep the ovum for longer, although some have been studied since 2008, with the longest shelf life used being seven days
 sabase adhik istemaal hone vaali laal rakt koshikaon kaa refrigerator ke taapmaana main shelf jivan 35-42 din he
 This period can be extended by freezing blood with a mixture of glycerol, but this process is expensive, so is rarely used, and an extremely cold freezer is necessary for its storage
 plasma ko adhik samay tak jamaakar rakhaa ja saktaa he or ek saal tak iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he or isaki aapurti koi badi samasya nahin he
 Limited storage time means that it is difficult to store large amounts of blood to prepare for a disaster
 america main 11 sitambar ke hamale ke baad is vishay par vistrut charchaa kii gayi or aam sahmati yah bani ki kisi aapadaa ke samay khun jamaa karnaa avyaavhaarik he or har vakt paryaapt aapurti ke liye prayaason par dhyaan kendrit kiya janaa chahie

 i remember it well khub acchhee tarah se
 maano maanas-shila par curry gahari lakeer ho


amit or avismaraneey


adrishy magar saghan anubhutiyon se aachhadit


jaise palken putali ke ehsaas se bhari-bhari rahati hai
 The soil of the village with the smell of familiarity 


 the buds from the sweet fragrance 


 the psyche-lake with sweet-golden dreams and the tender sensations as the consciousness is dull
 Neutralized by the endless flow of time
 Energized like Udalam Salila
 Yes, i remember, i remember exactly years ago that i had written somewhere about the interrelationship between Suranjan and his poetry
 That there is no need to distinguish between the two
 If you want to understand Suranjan then get into his poems
 Curt, dry, emotional, sensitive, dull, even selfish and sadistic, sweet-bitter and gritty
 Every form of Suranjan, his unique personality, each of his images, flaws and merits is captured in his poems
 ekadam paardarshee or spasht
 Suranjan has also written stories and novels, but he is identified as a poet
 swayan suranjan bhi khud ko kavi maanate hai
 But the poet is of romanticism
 iskaa kaaran sambhawatah yah bhi ho saktaa he ki unke bheetar kavita kaa pallavan kisi saamaajik yaa naitik patibaddhta, athwa bauddhikta ke teevr aaveg ke kaaran nahin hua
 Nor did he become a poet due to the pressure of creativity while studying
 The poem is born from the pain-filled songs of Mukesh in her mind and the melody of Lata
 filmi geet-sangeet kisi ko kavi-sahityakar bana saktaa he, isapar aap shaayad hi vishwaas karen
 isse pehle mujhe bhi nahin hota tha
 Seeing Suranjan and knowing that this is possible
 haalanki atishay bhavukta kii jo simaaen hai, vahi suranjan ke kavi kii bhi hai
 You can reject many of his poems
 magar jin kavitaaon main unki samvednaa saare tatbandh todakar bahi he, unpar aap vyaktivaadita kaa aarope to laga sakate hai, nakaar nahin sakate
 bina kisi bauddhik ahmanyata ke suranjan aaj bhi mukesh ko apana guru maanate hai
 And also a source of inspiration
 Regarding the intimacy of Suranjan and his poetry, which i said years ago, i still persist on it
 Meanwhile, the Earth has orbited thousands of suns
 hindon or yamuna jaisi kabhi kii sadanira, magar aaj pradooshan kii maar se abhishpt nadiyaan lakhon ton kachra baha chuki hai
 Suranjan himself has also gone on a desolation and settlement
 makaan, dukaan sabakuch bech-bachakar ve gaya laute, yah kahkar ki gaya kii mitti unhen bula rahi he
 His gullible mind could not understand that since migrating from Gaya years ago, so much water has flowed into the river Falgu
 isliye patni or bacchon ke saath jab gaya pahunche to paristhitiyaan puri tarah badal chuki thim
 Launched Sahityarath in an attempt to regain roots - a moving store of books
 In order to entice customers, copies of 'hanuman Chalisa' were distributed free of cost
 But the situation was the opposite
 isliye nae armaan, nae sapanom, nai ummiido ke saath dubaara dilli kii raah pakadani padi
 sanathan sangharsh ke saath baari utaar-chadhaav, antaheen aas-niraash ke bich suranjan kaa jivan aaj bhi vaisaa hi he, jaisaa bees varsh pehle tha
 My opinion about Suranjan in this long gap remains intact
 isliye nahin ki meri avadharanaen jadta or yathasthitwaad kii shikaar hai
 They have not come in the review and review phase
 meri chintaa to isliye he ki suranjan aaj bhi apni jidon or duragrahon se ubar nahin paae hai
 His frustrations remain the same even today
 balki is bich unki kaam-kunthaon ne to or bhi vikal udaanen bhari hai
 Yet what has not changed is Suranjan's intense sentiment, which is the adherence to his soul, the soul of his poetry
 is bich hamaare bich parichay or aparichay ke silsile main nirantarata rahi he
 Although the period of unfamiliarity is small, but it is also important for me
 shaayad iske peeche meraa yah soch he ki khalis parichay se ham kisi ko puri tarah nahin jaan pate
 vyakti ke anchhue pahaluon tak pahunchane, unhen samajhane, vivechit-virechit karne ke liye aparichay ke antaraal kii jarurat padati hi he
 That is, i have got so much time that i can revise my perception about Suranjan
 i can reconsider the affection that is in the mind towards them, which are rooted in duality
 And i have also done this
 apane aparichay ke dam par hi main yah daawa kar saktaa hum ki meri tippaniyon main sach kii paryaapt sambhaavnaaen hai
 If i have been very ruthless about Suranjan, then only because of this unfamiliarity
 Distances in the mental plane, that is, the state of unfamiliarity are possibly also with Suranjan
 jab bhi unhen mere prati nirmam hone kaa avasar mila, unhone bina chuke uskaa istemaal kiya
 If this situation comes, they will not miss even further
 It will be said without fail
 Rather, he keeps on extracting such opportunities
 kabhi sidhe, samvaad ke madhyam se, kabhi kavita ke bahaane
 agar vah naaraaz haa to ugrata savai ho jaati he
 a few years ago he had to deal with resentment
 yahaan main naaraazgi ke kaarnon kii tah man nahin jaaoongaa
 is lekh kaa yah uddeshy bhi nahin he
 In those days Suranjan wrote a poem on me
 kavita kya thi, kisi thi, nahin maaloom
 na to vah suranjan ne kabhi mujhe sunai, na maine unase aagrah hi kiya
 Perhaps because i have the courage to listen to bitter things about myself, i lacked it
 yaa shaayad yah sochakar ki us kavita main jaanane laayak kuch tha hi nahin
 jis manahosthiti main suranjan ne vah kavita mere upar likhi thi, athwa mujhe lekar jis bhav kii abhivyakti vah apni kavita ke madhyam se chaahate the, usamen vyanjana rachana ko kalatmak oonchai dene main sahaayak hoti
 lekin vyangy main suranjan kaa haath tang he
 In such a situation, the poem is hardly anything other than the impulse of heartbreak or frustration
 At least that is what i thought
 kuch dinon baad jaisaa ki suranjan ne swayan hi bataaya, kavita kaa sheershak unhone mere hi vyangy upanyaas ‘jug-jug jivu bhrashtachar’ se liya tha
 He had recited that poem to many of our friends in a time of displeasure
 parantu main uskaa aswadan kabhi na kar sakaa
 sambhav main man main apriy sthiti se bachane kii laalasaa rahi ho
 isiilie maine na to suranjan se kavita sunaane kaa anurodh kiya, na un mitron ke kavita ke bare main jaanane main ruchi dikhaai, jo use sun chuke the
 That poem would be licking the dust even today among the hundreds of untouched poems of Suranjan
 This is also a way to face the situation, which i keep using every now and then
 Suranjan is also not weak about this
