 After the success of Rai's next film Aparajito, his international career started with full fuss

 Many critics, including Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak, consider it better than the first film

 isi saal main raay ne subhash mukhopadhyaay or anya lekhakon ke saath milakar bacchon kii patrika sandesh ko punerjeevit kiya
 His grandfather started this magazine and Rai had been collecting money for this for a long time

 columbia ne 1970 or 80 ke dashakon main kai baar is pariyojna ko punerjeevit karne kaa prayaas kiya lekin baat kabhi aage nahin badi
 Rai has cited a 1980s site and sound format for the project's failure and other details by his official biographer Andrew Robinson in The Inner Eye

 Subrata Mitra's work in the cinematography of early films is highly appreciated and critics believe that when Mitra left after the rift, the level of portrayal of Rai's films decreased
 raay ne mitra kii bahut prashansa kii, lekin raay itani ekaagratha se filmein banaate the ki charulatha ke baad se raay camera khud hi chalaane lage, jiske kaaran mitra ne 1966 se raay ke liye kaam karnaa band kar diya

 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 isamen unhone muslim lig kii musalamaanon ke liye ek alag desh pakistan kii maang kii aalochana kii
 It also argued that Hindus should accept Muslims from Pakistan
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 ek maanav se hin samajha gaya or jiskaa sparsh maatr pradooshan failaane kaa paryaapt kaaran he? Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia
 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims

 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya

 The day of 26 November has been chosen to spread the importance of the Constitution and to spread the thoughts and concepts of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar
 jai bhim yah ambedakarvaadi logon dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaala ek abhivadan vaakyansh hai
 'jai Bhim' means "bhimrao Ambedkar's victory
" " yaa "bhimrao ambedkar jindaabaaj
 "this phrase was coined by Babu l ॰ n ॰ Hardas, a follower of Ambedkar
 babu hardaas ne bhim vijay sangh ke shramikon kii madad se abhivadan ke is tareeke ko badhaava diya
 Blue color is a symbol of Ambedkar
 ambedkar ko nila rang priy tha kyonki vah "samanta" pratik hai
 And blue is the color of the sky, which reflects his vividness, Ambedkar had the same vision and he used it a lot in personal life too
 babasahab kii pratimaa hameshaa nile rang ke kot main dikhti he
 In 1942, he founded the Scheduled Castes Federation of India Party, the flag of that party was blue in color and Ashoka Chakra was situated in the middle of it
 iske baad 1956 main jab puraani party ko khatm kar republican party of india kaa gathan kiya gaya to isamen bhi isi nile rang ke jhande kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 He took this color from the flag of Mahar, the largest Dalit class in Maharashtra
 ab yah buddha dharm kaa ashokachakr vaala yah nila jhanda ambedkar kaa pratik chinh ban chukaa hai
 Later, all other Ambedkarite organizations and Patis, including Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh, Bahujan Samaj Party, also adopted the same color and thus became a symbol of resistance, struggle and identity of Ambedkarite Buddhists and Dalits
 buddha evam dalit har maukey par nila rang tathaa nila jhande kaa istemaal karte hai

 Hakim Abul Qasim Firdausi was a Persian Persian poet
 unhone shahnamaa kii rachana kii jo baad main faras kii rashtriya mahakavy ban gai
 In it, he wrote about Iran before Arabic Fatah on Persia in the seventh century
 firdausi kaa janm 920 i
 main khurasaan ke toos naamak kasbe main hua
 a poet named Asadi taught him and inspired him towards poetry
 usne iran ke puranic raajaaon ke sambandh main use ek granth diya jiske aadhaar par firdausi ne shahname kii rachana kii
 It has 60,000 lions
 vah 35 varsh tak is mahaan kaary main vyast rahaa or 25 farvari 1010 i
 ko ise puraa kiya
 He was 85 at this time
 usne yah kavy sultan mahmud gazanvi ko samarpit kiya jisane 999 i
 main khurasaan vijay kar liya tha
 He was given only 20 thousand dirhams
 firdausi ke tan badan main aag lag gai
 He ran away from his country towards Hirat, but before fleeing, he added a poem to the Shahnama, which strongly condemns Sultan Mahmud
 shahname main firdausi ne iran ke puranic baadshahon kii, jinke karnaamon se vah atyadhik prabhavit tha, badi kii prashansa kii he
 His poetry reveals his love for ancient Iran and hatred for the Arabs
 sabhavat: kattar musalamaanon ko santusht karne ke liye usne baad main yusuf julykha naamak masanvi likhi jise bavahid shaasha bahauddaula tathaa uske putr sultanuddaula ko samarpit kiya
 He then returned to his homeland Tus and died there
 uski qabr iran ke darshneey sthanon main he
 It is said that as his janaza was leaving the gate of a nearby village, a caravan arrived with 60,000 dinars sent by Sultan Mahmud, whose poet had hoped
 firdausi kii putree ne samast dhan, daan punya main laga diya
 Very beautiful illustrated manuscripts of the Shahnama are preserved in large museums of the world
 1811 i
 main kalkatte main 1878 i
 main paris se or 1877-1885 i
 ke bich liden se iske sanskaran prakashit hue
 Subsequently several editions were published from India and Iran
 sansar kii anek bhashaaon main iske anuwaad chap chuke hai
 Mahmud Ghaznavi is said to have pledged to Firdausi that he would give a dinar for every word of 'shahnama'
 varshon kii mehnat ke baad jab 'shahnamaa' taiyaar ho gaya or firdausi use lekar mahmud gazanabi ke darbar main gaya to samraat ne use prayek shabd ke liye ek dinar nahin balki ek dirham kaa bhugtan kara diya
 It is said that angry at this, Firdausi returned and did not even take a dirham
 yah vaayada kilaafi kuch aisi thi jaise kisi kavi ke prati shabd ek rupee dene kaa vachan dekar prati shabd ek paisa diya jaye
 Firdausi angrily wrote a few lines against Mahmud Ghaznabi
 ve panktiyaan itani prabhaavshaalee thi ki puure samrajya main fail gayin
 a few years later, his trusted ministers requested Mahmud Ghaznavi that Firdausi be paid at the same rate that was fixed
 samraat ke kaaran poochne par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ham log samrajya ke jis kone main jate hai hamen ve panktiyaan sunne ko milti hai jo firdausi ne aapke viruddh likhi hai or hamaara sirf shame se jhuk jaataa he
 If he is given money at the prescribed rate, then we will get a lot of moral strength
 ' samraat ne aadesh de diya
 When a car full of dinars reached Firdausi's house, Firdausi's funeral was coming out from inside the house
 puri umr garibi, tangi or mufalisi main kaatane ke baad firdausi mar chukaa tha
 It is said that his girl, the only child of Firdausi, refused to take this paddy
 is tarah samraat kavi kaa karjadaar rahaa or aaj bhi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Firdausi's Shahnama is as famous today or more famous as the lines that Firdausi wrote while criticizing Mahmud Ghaznabi
 firdausi kaa 'shahnamaa' darasal iran kaa itihaas hi nahin irani asmita kii pahchaan he
 It describes the achievements of ancient Iran
 samraaton kaa itihaas he
 The ancient Persian texts have been incorporated and given a new look
 myth or itihaas ke sammishran se ek adbhut prabhaav utpann hua he
 There are excellent examples of love, rebellion, valor, wickedness, humanism, war, courage that have made the 'shahnama' the immortal masterpiece of Iranian literature
 irani sahitya main 'shahnamaa' jitani tarah se jitani baar chapa he utana or koi pustak nahin chhapi he
 Firdausi has created characters like Rustom and Sohrab which have become part of human memory
 jaisaa ki iraniyon ne apane bade kaviyon ke saath kiya he, firdausi ke madhbare ke chaaron ore sundar baag he
 There are statues here and there

 sar creek listen sahaayta·soochna bharat or pakistan kii seemaa par 96 kilometre lambi ek jwariya eschuri he, yah gujarat ke kuccha jile or pakistan me sindh kii seemaa se lagi hui he
 There is a dispute between India and Pakistan about the border, but this dispute is rarely discussed
 yah vivaad kuccha ke ran main 96 kilometre lambey muhane ko lekar he jo bharat ke gujarat ko pakistan ke sindh praant se alag karata he
 The Gulf of Sir Creek has an old relationship with the dispute
 east india company ke senapati charles napier ne 1842 me sindh jeetne ke baad us pradesh kaa prashasan mumbai rajya ko saunp diya tha
 After this, the British government, which was running its administration in Sindh, had drawn the boundary line between Sindh and Mumbai province which passed through the middle of Kutch
 isamen yah sampoorn khadi sindh praant me dikhaai gai thi
 That is, it was separated from the original state of Kutch and added to Sindh
 duusari taraf dilli ke angrez sarkaar apane adhikrut nakshe main sindh or kuccha ke bich kii simarekha ko kuccha ke ran tak khinchne ke baad khadi ke pradesh ke paas atka kar dikhaati thi
 After independence, Pakistan asserted its ownership over the Gulf region
 In response to this, India proposed that a straight line from the Rann of Kutch to the face of the Gulf should be considered as the boundary line
 parantu yah prastaav pakistan ko manjuur nahi tha
 In this way, the area of about 650 square kilometers of the head of the head is still a disputed area and there are reports of Indian fishermen being picked up by Pakistani rangers from this region
 siachin ke baad sir crik bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav badhaane vaali ek or simarekha he
 But it is not as much discussed in Siachen

 After years of study, when Albert Einstein announced this theory in 1916, the world of science was stirred up and the universe's vision announced in 1687 by Isaac Newton was permanently reversed for two and a half years
 bhautik shaastra par iskaa itnaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa ki log aadhunik bhautikee ko shastreey bhautikee se alag vishay bataane lage or albert oinstin ko aadhunik bhautikee kaa pita mana jane laga
 Dik is a Sanskrit word meaning place around
 ise angreji main "spes" kehete hai
 Humans have the ability to steam the three aspects of a problem - top-down, forward-backward and right-left
 aam jivan main manushya dik main koi badlaav nahin dekhte
 Newton's physics used to say that if two objects in space are one kilometer away from each other and neither of them move, they will remain one kilometer away from each other
 hamaara rose kaa saadhaaran jivan bhi hamen yahi dikhalaataa he
 But Einstein said that it is not so
 dik khich or sikud saktaa he
 It is also possible that the two objects which are one kilometer away from each other, should not move themselves, but due to some circumstances the problem may spread to a quarter and a quarter or a quarter to a quarter
 newton kii shastreey bhautikee main yah kaha jaataa tha ki brahmand main har jagah samay kii raftaar ek hi he
 If you are sitting in one place and a friend decides to travel for ten years at half the speed of light, then after that journey, you will have passed ten years and your friend too
 lekin inastin ne is par bhi kaha ki yah vishwaas galat he
 When something moves at a speed, time becomes slower for it and the faster it moves, the slower it becomes
 aapkaa mitra agar apane hisaab se das varsh tak roshni se aadhi gati par yatra kar ke laut aae, to uske to das saal guzarenge lekin aapke saadhe gyaarah saal guzar chuke honge
 Einstein showed in the theory of relativity that in fact there is a four-dimensional dikala in the universe, consisting of three periods of time and one in which all things and energies are located
 yah dik-kaal sthai nahin he- na dik bina kisi badlaav ke hota he or na yah zaruri he ki samay kaa bahaav har vastu ke liye ek jaisaa ho
 It can be twisted, pulled, and shrunk by affecting the time period, and the same happens in the universe
 is siddhanth ke madhyam se hi samay yatra kii avadharana nirmit hui he
 The change in time produces every object and every speed, but large objects and speeds near light produce more changes
 manushyon kaa aakaar itnaa chota or uski raftaar itani dhimi he ki unhen saapekshata siddhant ke asar apane jivan main nazar hi nahin aate, lekin jab vah brahmand main or chizon kaa gaur se adhyayan karte hai to saapekshata ke chinh kai jagahon par pate hai
 When the velocity of the object becomes even 5% of the velocity of light, then we start to see the signs of the theory of relativity
 newton kaa maananaa tha ki har vastu main apni ore khinchne kii ek shakti hoti he jise usne gurutvkarshan kaa naam diya
 In a big thing like Earth, this gravity is very high, due to which we stick to the Earth and do not fly away from space in space
 lekin yah newton nahin bataa paye ki gurutvkarshan bal vastav main kis prakaar kaary karata he or kyon kaary karata he
 Einstein said that according to the theory of relativity, the idea that material things attract each other is an illusion, which has arisen due to wrong mechanical assumptions about nature
 unhone kaha ki prithvi badi he or uski vajah se uske ird-gird kaa dik-kaal mud gaya he or apane upar tah ho gaya he
 We live in this difficult time and because of this twist, we are pushed closer to the earth
 isaki tulana ek chadar se kii ja sakati he jiske chaar cono ko chaar logon ne khinch ke pakadaa ho
 Now if a heavy ball is placed in the middle of this sheet, then the sheet will sit in the middle, that is, its yarn will be bent in the middle
 ab agar ek halaki gend ham chadar ke kone par rakhe to vah ludak kar bade gole kii taraf jaaegi
 Einstein said that a clumsy man could see that the small ball was pulled by the big ball, so the ball went to him
 lekin asli vajah thi ki gend zamin kii taraf janaa chaahati thi or gole ne chadar main kuch aisi mudan paidaa kii ki gend uske paas chali gai
 Similarly, he said that it is a myth that gravity is caused by some attraction
 gurutvkarshan kii asli vajah he ki har vastu jo antariksh main chal rahi hoti he, vah dik ke aisi mudan ke prabhaav main aakar kisi badi chiz kii ore chalane lagati he
 In fact, gravity is only a part of inertia, the movements of stars and planets arise from their characteristic inertia and their path depends on the circular elements of time and time
 jis prakaar chumbak ke chaaron ore chumbakeey kshetra hota he usee prakaar khagoleey vastu apane chaaron ore ke akaash main ek kshetra bikherti he
 Just as the activity of an iron piece in a magnetic field is guided by the design of the field, similarly the path of an object in a gravitational field is determined by the geometric state of that field
 oinstin kaa gurutvkarshan sambandhi niyam dikkaal satati ke kshetreey tatwon kii jaankaree detaa he
 Primarily a part of this rule expresses the relationship of the structure of the field around the gravitational object
 inastin ke is sansani failaa dene vaale siddhant kaa ek bahut bada pramaan roshni par gurutvkarshan kaa asar dekhne se aayaa
 Newton's theory in physics was that two objects pull each other according to the mass of the two
 lekin prakaash kaa to dravyaman hota hi nahin, yani shunya hota he
 So, according to Newton, there is no question of something that does not have any mass or weight, but it can be pulled from the gravity of another object, no matter how big the other object is
 prakaash hameshaa ek sidhi lakeer main chalata hi rahata he
 But if Einstein is right and due to some big thing, the problem should be turned, then the light should also be turned with difficulty
 yani brahmand main sthit badi vastuon ko lens kaa kaam karnaa chahie- jis tarah chashme, doorabeen yaa sookshmbin kaa lens prakaash modta he usee tarah taron or grahon ko bhi modana chahie
 In 1924, a Russian physicist named Ostra Kholson predicted Einstein's theory of relativity, predicting that such gravitational lenses would be there in the universe
 pachpan saal baad, 1979 main pehali dafaa yah chiz dekhi gai jab twin kwasar naam kii vastu kii ek ke bajaae do-do chhaviyaan dekhi gai
 After that such images of far-flung objects have been seen in which some very large object is placed between those objects and the earth, which acts as lenses on the rays of light coming from the first object and either torsion its image
 Or show more than one image of him in the sky

 Sometimes it is also called 'astrophysics' although it is a major branch of astrophysics in which stars are studied
 prakruti ke rahasyon ko samajhane k utkar ichha se perit hokar manushya ne akashiya pandon kaa adhyayan prarambh kiya
 He obtained as much information about them as could be obtained with the help of eyes only; For example, he began to understand the daily and annual movements of the earth and the physical events associated with it, the arts of the moon and the lunar month, the movements of the planets, etc
 parantu jab tak surya, chandramaa tathaa grahon ko bimb or taron ko prakashabindu samajha jaataa rahaa, inke vishay main adhik na janaa ja sakaa
 The Italian astrologer Galileo Galilei used the telescope for the first time in 1612 in the study of the sky; But until the advancement of the telescope was made, there was no use of any more important information other than the study of the planets
 jyon jyon doordarshee kii rachana main sudhaar hota gaya, jyotish sambandhi anusandhan main uski upyogita badhati gai, parantu khagolbhautikee kaa prarambh to 19veen shatabdi ke dwitiya chaturthaansh main hua, jab surya tathaa anya taron ke prakaash ke adhyayan main germany ke bhautikavid, gustaf robert kirkhhof, dwaara pratipaadit varnakramiki ke siddhanton kaa upyog prarambh hua
 Photography helped immensely in the development of this instrument, because with its help, the spectrographs became available for comparative study permanently
 isi prakashmiti or varnakram kii rekhaon kii tivrata naapane ke sadhano ne varnakramiki dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan main sahyogi banakar, khagoleey pindon kii bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main amuly soochna pradaan kii
 When a gas is lit, according to Kirkhhoff's theory, it radiates only the light of particular characters, not radiating white light
 in varnon ko gas ke lakshanik varna kehete hai
 Which characters will appear in these colors, if they emit white light from the radiant gas in that physical state, then the spectrum of white light does not become black, but the characteristic characters of the gas are absent in it
 iske atirikt yadi shwet prakaash ke udgam kaa taap gas ke taap se unchaa ho, to varncrampatt main gas ke lakshanik varno ke sthaan main kaali rekhaayen, jinhen fronhophar rekhaayen kehete hai, prakat hoti hai
 Based on the study of these black lines, it can be said that in which gas the white light has reached the spectroscope and its gas atoms are in what physical state
 kirkhhof ne is siddhant kaa pratipaadan prayogon ke aadhaar par kiya tha
 But later, with the help of knowledge of atomic structure and quantum theory, the laws of spectroscopy could be theoretically presented
 uparyukt kathan se yah spasht he ki khagolbhautikee ke adhyayan main varnakramiki ke saadhan kii upyogita kii ek swaabhaavik seemaa he
 This is because the spectrograph can give information about the physical state of matter only when the substance is in the form of radiant gas
 at: is saadhan se yah nahin janaa ja sakegaa ki prakaash ke path main sthit pindkhand kin padaarthon ke bane hue hai tathaa unki bhautik avasthaa kya he
 The light that comes from celestial bodies is produced in its internal parts, yet nothing can be said about the composition of those parts with the help of spectroscopy
 vah to keval in pindon ko ghere hue gasmandal ke vishay main hi soochna dene main samarth he
 As a result, to know about the composition and physical state of the internal parts of these bodies, different means are needed from spectral spectra
 in sadhano kaa varnan aage kiya jayega
 In consideration of the means of study, the Tarapind can be divided into two main parts: the inner part and the gasosphere
 varnakram ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par taron ke vishay main anek tathy gyaat kiye ja chuke hai jinamein se pramukh nimnlikhit he: The Sun and other stars are huge spherical bodies of radiant gas, whose surface parts, called dorsal, have thousands of degrees
 prishth se jyon jyon taare ke centre kii ore badhen, taap me main vruddhi hoti jaati he; yahan tak ki kendriya taap kai lakh paaya jaataa he
 The prayek taare kaa aantarik bhaag gasmandal se ghira hua he
 The elements that have been identified in these gasmands are also found on earth
 iskaa arth yah kadaapi nahin ki yahan par prithvi par paae janevaale tatwon se bhinn anya tatv nahin honge
 In fact there are such Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of stars which are different from the lines of any element found on earth
 taron ke gas mandal main mukhya rup se hydrogen, helium, carbon, loha aadi upasthit hote hai
 The Indian astrologer, Meghnad Saha, gave his famous thermodynamic formula in 1922, with the help of which the fact of the spectrum strip can be understood
 england ke prasiddh jyotishi adington ke shabdon main saaha sutara, doordarshee ke pashchaat, jyotish main sabase adhik mahatvapurn avishkaar he
 Effective temperature is determined by studying the continuous spectrum of stars
 anveshan main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki tara ek adarsh krishna pind he, jiskaa taatpary yah he ki uskaa prishth is prakaar sangathit he ki vah un sab vikiranon kaa, jo usapar nipaat karte hai, purna rup seavasoshana kar letaa he
 Kirkhhoff and Belfur and Stuart have proved that if the energy of a body does not change, each character has its radiation and absorption volumes in a particular ratio
 krishna shabd kaa pind ke drishy rang se koi sambandh nahin he
 Theoretical, or experimental, studies of such bodies have proved that the intensity of each color is fixed at a particular temperature
 plank ne ooshmaagatiki ke aadhaar par ek sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya he, jo yah bataata he ki ooshmaa gatikeey samya kii avasthaa main adarsh krishna pind ke amuk varna ke vikiran kii amuk tivrata hoti he
 The diagram above shows the relationship between wavelength and radiation intensity
 pind ke die hue taap ke liye vakr or tarangadaidhray ke aksh ke madhya main simit kshetrafal us sampurna urja ko nishchit karata he jiskaa vikiran tara akaash main prati kshan kar rahaa he
 It is also clear from these curves that along with the change in temperature of the body there is also a change in the wavelength of maximum intensity
 vastut: jyon jyon pind ke taap main vruddhi hoti jaati he, mahattam tivrata kaa tarangadaidhray ghatata jaataa he, arthath vah varnakram main drishy bhaag kii ore hatataa jaataa he
 According to Planck's rule for the ideal Krishna body, the formula for revealing the relation of heat and maximum intensity of wavelength is easily determined
 at: taare ke prabhavi taap ko nishchit karne ke liye pehle uske varnakram ke adhyayan se mahattam tivrata ke vikiran kaa tarangadaidhray gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The effective temperature of the star is actually the temperature of that ideal Krishna body whose maximum intensity of radiation is in the same wavelength as that of the star
 taron ke varnakram lekhon main badi bhinnata pai jaati he, parantu phir bhi yadi mukhya mukhya fronhophar rekhaon par hi dhyaan den to in varncrampatton ko kuch virgon ko kuch virgon main baanta ja saktaa he
 In the last century, many astrologers tried to classify stars with the idea of alphabetical order, but the prevailing classification was done in the first years of the current century by Professor Mickering, Mrs
 Fleming and Kumari Kennan at the Harvard Wageshala
 is vargeekaran main kuch aksharon kaa prayog kiya gaya he, jinke varan kaa suvidha ke atirikt or koi vishesh vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 The main classes of this classification are marked with O, B, A, F, C, a and M
 For convenience, each of these classes is divided into ten subclasses
 vyavhaar main taare ke varg kaa nishchay uske varncrampatt kii pramukh avasorana rekhaon kii tivrata ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, jo taap evam daab donon par nirbhar karti hai
 Therefore, the effect of temperature and pressure is considered in the classification in such a way that most of the stars can be divided into two main categories: massive stars and vamana stars and then the intensity of absorption lines in each range varies so regularly that the given intensities For the class of stars, consequently its effective temperature, can be decided exclusively
 diye hue varg ke vishaal taare kaa taap usee varg ke vaaman taare ke taap kii apeksha kam hota he
 Surya is a member of Vamana category
 nimnaankit sarini main in virgon se sangat vaaman shrenee ke taron ke liye prabhavi taap evam varncrampatt kii vishetaayen di gai he: Later on, in order to include the nonspecific observed strings in the classification, at the beginning of this classification, the sum of squares and at the end, n and r were used, and the resulting classification is as follows: varnakramiki ke saadhan ne yah bhi prakat kiya ki bahut se taare, jo bade se bade doordarshee dwaara liye gaye photographon main akele dikhaai dete hai, vastav main do taare hai, jo apane gurutvakentre kii parikrama karte rahete hai
 These stars are called spectral coupler stars
 chumbakeey kshetra main sthit deeptiman gas kii varnakram rekhaayen saadhaaran dasha main vikirit rekhaon kii apeksha adhik vistrut hoti hai tathaa prayek do main or kabhi kabhi adhik uparekhaon main khandit ho jaati he
 This is called the Geman effect
 babakaak ne kuch taron ke varncrampatton main is prabhaav ko vidyaman paaya, jiske aadhaar par usne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki in taron main surya kii bhanti chumbakeey kshetra vidyaman he
 The space between the stars is not completely lacking in substance
 vahaan atyant visarit dhuli tathaa pindkhand vidyaman hai
 For example, in the galaxy, about 25 nodules of radius 10–5 cm per cubic cm are found, one hydrogen atom per cubic cm, and 10–5 cm per cubic km
 is prakaar is sthaan main sthit padaarth kaa ghanatv lagbhag 3n10-24 gram prati ghan senmi0 he
 The density of matter in the star gases is almost the same
 yah kathan akashganga ke anya bhaagon ke vishay main satya nahin he
 It is now known with certainty that the density is different in different parts of each nebula
 taare ke bheetar ke padaarth kii pravriti gas ke ghaney meghon ke rup main vidyaman hone kii pai jaati he
 The mass of these clouds is similar to the beam of stars and sometimes the mass of massive constellations
 yah megh apane peeche sthit taron ke prakaash kaa avasorana hi nahin, varan uskaa prakirnan bhi karte hai, jisase taare kaa prakaash rakt varna kaa abhasith hone lagata he; udaahranarth, prithvi ke vayumandal ke anu sandhya samay surya ke prakaash kaa prakirnan kar surya ko rakt varna pradaan karte hai
 It is only by studying the quantity of this scattering that the determination of the mass of the bodies present in matter within the star is determined
 jaisaa pehle likhaa ja chukaa he, taron ke aantarik sanghatan ko jaanane kaa koi bhautik saadhan uplabdh nahin he
 Hence mathematical means have to be used to study this composition
 awalokit saamagree tathaa bhautik siddhanton ke anukool taron ke aantarik bhaag ke saral praturup kii kalpana kii jaati he or phir is praturup ke bhautik lakshna ganit kii reeti se nishchit kiye hote hai
 If these signs are similar to the star-illuminated signs, then it is concluded that there are similar physical states in the interior of the star as in the model
 aise kitne hi pratirupon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 As a result, proper knowledge of the composition of the interior of the stars has been obtained
 kuch prakaar ke taron kaa punj or unke ardhavyas gyaat hai
 Apart from this, each star has an essential characteristic that it continuously radiates energy everywhere in the sky
 urja ke vikiran kii dar, jise taare kii jyoti kehete hai, taare kaa utana hi mahatvapurn lakshan he jitne uske punj or ardhavyas
 If an outline of the stars and their radii is drawn, it becomes clear that the stars can be divided into approximately three parts
 taron ke punj or jyotishyon kaa rekhachitr bhi is kathan kaa samarthan karata he
 For most stars, their light rotates according to the power of about 3
5 degrees of the beam
 in taron ke samooh ko mukhya shrenee kehete hai
 The stars which are different from this category are of two types: White Vamana and Trumpler Stars
 trumpler taron kii jyoti unke punj ke anupaat main vicharan karti he
 If one compares the stars and radii of the white and vamana of the main class of the same beam, it is found that the white aeration is much less vibrant than the main star and the radius is also much less
 at: shwet vaaman kaa padaarth atyant ghan hona chahie
 The second-lure is considered representative of the white-vamana category
 iskaa madhya ghanatv lagbhag 6
8 jr104 gram prati ghan senmi0 he
 Here, if you compare the stars of the main range of the same effective heat and the lights of white Vamana, then the white Vamana is much less vibrant than the stars of the main range
 ye bhinnataayen taron ke aantarik sanghatan kii bhinnata kii dyotak hai
 In Treta Yuga, Lord Parshuram killed Sahatrajun and killed the Kshatriya dynasty
 us samay kuch kshatriyon va kshatraniyon nen jangal va pahaad kii or bhagkar apni raksha kii thi
 Among them, the queen of Chandrasen Raja was in pregnancy
 vah bhagkar bagadalia muni kii kuti main pahunchi
 Muni gave shelter to the woman seeing her sad and orphaned
 jab parashuram ji ko is baat kii khabar lagi to vah bagadalia muni ke paas pahunche, bagadalia muni bhagwaan parashuram ji ko aayaa dekh bade hi adarbhav se unka satkar kiya evam puure vidhi vidhaan se unki puja archana kar unhe asana diya or prasad taiyaar kara kar bhojan grahan karane kaa nivedan kiya
 Seeing the reverence of Bagdalia Muni, Lord Parshuram ji gave food and after meal Lord Parshuram ji said that the queen of Chandrasen king has come to your hut with womb, hand it over to me so that i can erase it with her womb
 bagadalia muni nen unhe dena sweekaar kiya
 Then Lord Parashuram ji was happy on Bagdalia Muni and asked him for a beautiful journey, then Bagdalia Muni said that you give us the womb of the same woman
 bhagwaan parashuram ji yah sunakar hanse or stri ko waapas karane ko sweekaar kiya
 Bagdalia Muni then prostrated the woman to Lord Parashurama's feet lotus
 parashuram ji nen prasann hokar bagadalia muni se kaha ki aap to jaanate he main kshatriyon kaa naash karane vaaka tino loko main vidit hoon parantu aapane is stri ke garbh ko maang liya he is kaaran ab main ise nahin maaroonga kintu mere rahete koi kshatriya batch nahi saktaa is kaaran jab is stri kii garbhavastha samaapt ho tab is balak ko chitragupta ke vansh sanskaar karakar ise kysth dharm dijiega
 In future, Bagdalia gotra with this dynasty will be called Kayastha
 hindi sahitya kaa aadhunik kaal tatkaaleen rajnatik gatividhiyon se prabhavit hua
 It can be considered as the best era of Hindi literature, in which the prose, criticism, story, drama and journalism developed along with the poetry

 tikkann ek kavi the
 He was one of the poetess who translated the Mahabharata into Telugu for centuries
 tikkan kaa avataran aadi kavi nannay ke do shatabdiyon ke pashchaat hua
 He was a minister of Nelluraniyan king Manum Siddha
 mantri komann tathaa annamaba tikkann ke matamita the
 The father was also 'guntarivibh' i
e
 Tikkann was accomplished and born in Pandit dynasty
 iske dada bhaskarmantri bhi kavi hue
 During the time of Tikkann, both Shaivism and Vaishnavism were strongly propagated and there was a lot of struggle in both
 in dharmo ke anuyaayi paraspar darshan or bhaashan ke bhi vimukh the
 Seeing such a situation, which gave rise to the spirit of the deity, considering it to be the presiding deity, the Tikkanas too were determined for the strength of these religions
 tikkann manumasiddh ke mantri hi nahin aadarneey kavi bhi the
 Manusmiddhi's discrimination with King Ganapathideva of Arugallu saved the two kings of Tikkanna from going to war as ministers
 raajnneeti ke achche gyaata hone ke kaaran inhone shrikrishna ke dautya kaa punarabhinay sucharu rup se kiya
 Tikkann's first work 'nirshkottara Ramayana' was dedicated to King Manumasiddha
 nirvachan granthon main chand hi chand milte hai, champu ke dyotak gadhy ke ansh nahin hote
 Although this text is a translation form of Srimadramayana's Uttarkand, Tikkanna attained independence in many parts
 tikkann kii duusari rachana andhra mahabharat he, jab ki somyag karke ve somyaji oopaadhidhari bhi ban gaye
 Not taking the translated portion of Aranayaparva, Tikkann started from Viratparva to the end and fortified fifteen festivals and in this work, Nannay was followed
 paatro ke chithran evam rason ke poshan main inhone badi dakshata pradarshit kii
 Being a minister himself, his seriousness and spontaneity arise in his creation in politics, warfare etc
 tikkann kii style pradhanat: samvadstyli he jisamen paatro ke sambhaavnon dwaara katha kaa purogaman hota he
 Like Nannay, he was not in favor of the long-tempered souls
 do tihaai telegu shabdon or shesh sanskrit padaavalee kaa unhonen prayog kiya
 Clean and spiritual subjects can also be expressed through the native language, this is proved by the creation of Tikkann
 'maarg' evam deshi paddatiyon ko apnaane ke kaaran inako 'ubhay kavimitra' kii oopaadhi bhi mili
 The folklore and idioms are also found in their composition
 tikkann ne harihardev ko jo shiv tathaa keshav kii abhinnata ke pratik hai, apane granth ko samarpit kiya or is kaaran dharmik ekta ke pravartak ke rup main bhi tikkann kii gananaa kii jaati he
 The qualities of Padlalitya, Artha Gaurav, imagination and logic etc
 which are found in the creation of Tikkan are all rare in the composition of any single poet
 tikkann ke shishy ketann bhi kavi hue, jinhone apana dashakumar charit naamak padyakavy guru ko samarpit kiya
 Khandakavya is a form of management poetry in literature
 jivan kii kisi ghatana vishesh ko lekar likhaa gaya kavy khandakavy he
 It is clear from the word "khand Kavya" that only one event of human life prevails in it
 jisamen charit nayak kaa jivan sampoorn rup main kavi ko prabhavit nahin karata
 Poet Charitra, being influenced by some outstanding event in the life of the hero, inaugurates that particular section of life in his poetry
 prabandhaatmakataa mahakavy evam khand kavy donon main hi rahati he parantu khand kavy ke kathasutra main jivan kii anekarupatha nahin hoti
 Hence its plotline quickly ends to end like the story
 mahakavy pramukh katha kesath anya anek praasangik kathayen bhi judi rahati hai isliye iskaa kathanak upanyaas kii bhanti dhire-dhire falaagam kii ore agrasar hota he
 There is only one major story in Khandakavya, the relevant stories are not found in it
 sanskrit sahitya main isaki jo ekmaatr paribhaasha sahitya darpan main uplabdh he vah is prakaar he- According to this definition, a poetic treatise in which a language or sub-language is composed and denoted by a story that does not contain all the treaties is a fragment
 vah mahakavy ke keval ek ansh kaa hi anusaran karata he
 Accordingly, some of the Acharya Khandakavya of Hindi consider such poetry which has been composed in the manner of epic, but only the particular section of it has been taken without taking the whole life in it
 arthath khandakavy main ek khand jivan is prakaar vyakt kiya jaataa he jisase vah prastut rachana ke rup main swat: prathit ho
 In fact, Khandakavya is a poetic poem whose plot has unitary discovery; The story should have a monologue and the narrative sequence should begin with development, culminate in the climax and definite purpose and be small in size
 laghutaa ke maapdand ke rup main aath se kam sargon ke prabandhkavy ko khandakavy mana jaataa he

 Siddharth is a novel by Herman Hayes, describing the spiritual journey of a boy named Siddhartha to the Indian subcontinent during the Buddha period
 yah pustak hes kaa nauvaan upanyaas he, ise german bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha
 It is simple but effective and poetic in style
 ise 1951 main america main prakashit kiya gaya tha or yah 1960 ke dashak main prabhavi ban gaya
 hes ne siddharth ko romaa rolland “maay dear friend” ko samarpit kiya
 The word Siddhartha is made up of two Sanskrit words, Siddha + meaning
 in donon shabdon kaa sanyojit arth he “jise arth mil gaya ho” yaa “jisane apana lakshya praapt kar liya ho”
 parivaar tyaagane se purv buddha kaa naam yuvaraj siddharth gautam tha
 In this book, Buddha is called "gautama"
 yah ek brahman putr siddharth se aarambh hota he
 He leaves home with his partner Govind to retire
 ve donon gyaan kii khoj main nikal padate hai
 As a businessman, Siddhartha moves from sagehood to a more worldly life with a lover and then returns to renunciation as he tries to achieve this goal
 yah kahani puraatan bharat main gautam buddha ke samay ke dauraan kii he 
 Experience is a squeeze of conscious events that a person experiences in his or her life - it indicates participation, learning and knowledge
 samaj samajhane kii shakti or samaveshan he
 In Hess's novel Siddhartha, experience is portrayed as the best means to gain understanding and knowledge of reality - Hess's creativity in Siddhartha's journey shows that understanding is not achieved through schooling, intelligence-based methods No one can understand, nor can one gain understanding by enjoying physical pleasures in the world and keeping the sufferings of the world together; However, it is a wealth of experiences that allowed Siddhartha to gain understanding
 isliye, ekal kaary arthhin hote hai jab ve swayan dwaara suvichaarit hon – siddharth kaa shraman ke saath ruknaa or unka prem or vyavsaay kii duniya main dub janaa nirvana kii ore agrasar nahin karte, phir bhi inhen vikarshan nahin mana ja saktaa, prayek kaary jiskaa siddharth ne uttardaayitv liya or vah ghatana jo siddharth ke saath ghati ho, usne samaj praapt karne main unki madad kii
 in ghatnaon se milakar hi anubhav bana he
 For example, Siddharth's passionate and sad love for his son is the experience that taught him empathy; After this experience, he was able to understand people like children
 Previously, although they had drowned in the world, they were unable to incorporate the motivation and life of childlike individuals
 or jabaki sansar ne unhen jakad rakhaa tha, unhen kamazor bana rahaa tha or ve uske aadi the, ve sansar kii prakruti ko samajhane main asamarth the
 At this point the experience of the world did not lead to understanding; Probably this hindered them
 In comparison, Siddharth's experience with his son allowed him to love, something he had not been able to do before; Once again, Prem himself did not lead them to understanding
 siddharth ke kevat banane, nadi se seekhney or shanti apnaane or apni yatra kaa saar tatv abhigrahan karne par upanyaas samaapt hota he: Hess's main concern in writing Siddhartha was to free himself from his 'disease of life' by adapting himself to the Indian philosophy as mentioned in the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita
 pustak kaa dwitiya bhaag atyadhik lanbaa likhane kaa kaaran tha ki hes “akhandta kii us gudh avasthaa kaa anubhav nahin kar paae jisaki siddharth ko aakanksha thi”
 aisa karne ke prayaas main, hes yatharth ardh-bairangi ke rup main rahe or hindu or buddha donon dharmagranthon kii pavitra shikshaaon main puri tarah dub gaye
 His desire was to achieve the 'perfection' which, in the novel, makes Buddha the most different
 "yah upanyaas hindu purushon, grihasth or bairangi / parityag ) ke jivan ke teen puranic charnon or buddha ke chaar mahaan satyon par likhaa gaya he or aath-mode vaala path jisamen baarah adhyay hai
 Ralph Freedman describes how Hess commented in one word that "my Siddhartha, in the end, true conscience learns not from a teacher but from a river, which flows with fun and silliness and from a kind old foolish man

 Buddhism was founded by Gautama Buddha in the 6th century BCE
 buddha kaa janm 563 isa purv main lumbini, nepal or mahaparinirvana 483 isa purv kushinagar, bharat main hua tha
 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent

 Buddhism is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, nearly 2 billion people in the world are followers of Buddhism

 Pew Research has reported a very small number of Buddhists from China, Japan and Vietnam, although these countries are the top three countries with the highest Buddhist population
 duniya ke 200 se adhik deshon main buddha anuyaayi hai
 But Buddhism is a 'major religion' religion in a total of 18 countries including China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Mongolia, Tibet, Laos, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and North Korea
 bharat, nepal, america, australia, indonesia, rus, bruneii, malaysia aadi deshon main bhi lakhon or karodon buddha anuyaayi hai
 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini
 isa purv 563 main rajkumaar siddharth gautam kaa janm yaheen hua tha
 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed
 keval samraat ashok kaa ek stambh avshesh ke rup main is baat kii gavaahi detaa he ki bhagwaan buddha kaa janm yahaan hua tha
 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
