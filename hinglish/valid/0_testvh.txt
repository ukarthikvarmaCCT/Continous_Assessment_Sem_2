 At a stage when the economy and the means of production are also undergoing fundamental changes, manipulation of the family's governance, structure and functions is inevitable and is also reflected

 There is no evidence that joint families in cities and villages are already reduced

 According to one view, even if there is some change in the family as a result of the situation, their joint form is not being destroyed

 The current family disintegration and changes are said to be the initial stages of this process

 In such families the husband is a temporary visitor to their children's home

 The form of the family is joint, in which there are children of mother and her daughter or grandchildren

 The Garo and Khasi tribes of the state of Assam also have a matrilineal and matrilineal family practice

 nal or damyanti kii katha bharat ke mahakavy, mahabharat main aati he
 Yudhishthira lost his everything in gambling and had to exile with his brothers
 vahiin ek rishi ne unhen nal or damyanti kii katha sunaayi
 Nal Nishad was the king of the country
 ve virasen ke putr the
 Nal was very brave and beautiful
 shastr-vidya tathaa ashv-sanchaalan main ve nipun the
 Damayanti was the only daughter of the King of Vidarbha
 vah bhi bahut sundar or gunwan thi
 Nal began to love her after listening to her beauty
 unke prem kaa sandesh damyanti ke paas badi kushalta se pahunchaaya ek hans ne
 And Damayanti also started burning in the face of her unknown lover
 is katha main prem or pidaa kaa aisa prabhaavshaalee put he ki bharat ke hi nahin desh-videsh ke lekhak va kavi bhi isse aakarshith hue bina na rah sake
 By translating Bop into Latin and into English poetry by Dean Milman, the West has also been well acquainted with this tale
 vidarbha desh main bhismak naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 His daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 At the same time, Nishal's son Nils ruled in Nishad country
 ve bade hi gunavan, satyawadee tathaa brahman bhakt the
 Those who came from the country of Nishad to Vidarbha praised the qualities of Maharaj Nal
 yah prashansa damyanti ke kaanon tak bhi pahaunchi thi
 Similarly, people coming from Vidarbha country would discuss the form and qualities of princess in front of Maharaj Nal
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki nal or damyanti ek-duusare ke prati aakrisht hote gayi
 In the Mahabharata, on the insistence of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, Maharishi Brihadeva told the story of nal-damayanti
 dharmraj ! nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal naam ke ek raja ho chuke hai
 He was very talented, supremely beautiful, truthful, Jitendriya, beloved of all, Vedas and Brahmin devotees
 unki sena bahut badi thi
 
 ve swayan astravidya main bahut nipun the
 They were brave, warrior, benevolent and irresistibly valiant too
 unhen jua khilne kaa bhi kuch-kuch shauk tha
 In those days, a king named Bhima ruled the country of Vidarbha
 ve bhi nal ke samaan hi sarvagun sampann or parakramee the
 He pleased the sage Daman and received four children from his boon — three sons and a daughter
 putron ke naam the—dam, dant, or daman
 The daughter's name was Damayanti
 damyanti lakshmi ke samaan rupavati thi
 His eyes were huge
 devataaon or yakshon main bhi waisi sundari kanya kahin dekhne main nahin aati thi
 In those days, how many people would come from Vidarbha country to Nishad country and would tell the form and quality of Damayanti in front of King Nal
 nishadh desh se vidarbha main jane vaale bhi damyanti ke saamne raja nal ke rup, gun or pavitra charitra kaa varnan karte
 Thus, mutual affection sprouted in both of their hearts
 ek din raja nal ne apane mahal ke udyaan main kuch hanson ko dekha
 They caught a goose
 hans ne kaha—‘aap mujhe chhod dijiye to ham log damyanti ke paas jaakar aapke gunon kaa aisa varnan karenge ki vah aapako avashya var legi
 'nal gave up laughing
 ve sab udakar vidarbha desh main gayi
 Damayanti was very happy to see her swans and started running towards them to catch the swans
 damyanti jis hans ko pakadaney ke liye daudti, vahi bol uthta ki ‘ari damyanti ! nishadh desh main ek nal naam kaa raja he
 She is as handsome as Ashwini Kumar
 manushyon main uske samaan sundar or koi nahin he
 It is as if idol is Cupid
 yadi tum uski patni ho jaao to tumhaara janm or rup donon safal ho jaayan
 We have seen the gods, gandharvas, humans, snakes and demons roaming around like a tap, but a beautiful man could not be seen
 jaise tum striyon main ratna ho, vaise hi nal purushon main bhushan he
 The pair of you two will be very beautiful
 ’ damyanti ne kaha—‘hans ! tum nal se bhi aisi baat kahana
 'hans returned to Nishad country and told the message of Damayanti from the tap
 damyanti hans ke munh se raja nal kii kirti sunakar unase prem karne lagi
 Her attachment grew so much that she would keep paying attention to them day and night
 sharir dhoomil or dublaa ho gaya
 She started looking down sakhiyon ne damyanti ke hriday kaa bhav tadkar vidarbharaj se nivedan kiya ki ‘aapaki putree aswasth ho gayi he
 'king Bhima thought big about his daughter
 ant main vah is nirnay par pahunche ki meri putree vivaahyogy ho gayi he, isaliye iskaa swayamvar kar dena chaiye
 He sent a invitation letter to the swayamvara to all the kings and informed them that the kings should take advantage by visiting the swayamvara of Damayanti and fulfill my desire
 desh-desh ke narpathi hathi, ghode or rathon kii dhwani se prithvi ko mukherit karte hue saj-dhajkar vidarbha desh main pahunchne lage
 Bhima made proper arrangements to welcome everyone
 devarshi naarad or parvat ke dwaara devataaon ko bhi damyanti ke swayamvar kaa samachar mil gaya
 All the Lokpal, including Indra, also left for Vidarbha country with their congregation and vehicles
 raja nal kaa chitt pehle se hi damyanti par aasakt ho chukaa tha
 He also traveled to Vidarbha country to join Damayanti's Swayamvara
 devataaon ne swarg se utarate samay dekh liya ki kaamdev ke samaan sundar nal damyanti ke swayamvar ke liye ja rahe hai
 Like the sun of the tap, the deities too were amazed by the Kanti and extraterrestrial appearance
 unhone pahichaan liya ki ye nal hai
 He parked his planes in the sky and came down and said to the tap - 'rajendra Nal! You are very Satyavrati
 aap ham logon kii sahaayta karne ke liye doot ban jaaiye
 'nal pledged and said' i will '
 phir poocha ki ‘aap log koun hai or mujhe doot banaakar koun-sa kaam lenaa chaahate hai ?’ indra ne kaha—‘humlog devtaa hai
 i am Indra and these are Agni, Varuna and Yama
 ham log damyanti ke liye yahan aaye hai
 The Gods told Nal that you should become our messenger and go to Damayanti and say that Indra, Varuna, Agni and Yamdevata want to come to you and marry you
 inamen se tum chaahe jis devtaa ko pati ke rup main sweekaar kar lo
 Nal said with both hands that 'devraj'! There is only one purpose for you and me to leave
 isaliye aap mujhe doot banaakar vahaan bhejein, yah uchit nahin he
 Whoever has a desire to get a woman as a wife, how can he leave her and go to her and say such a thing? You guys please forgive me about this damyanti kaa swayamvar hua jisamen na keval dharti ke raja, balki devtaa bhi nal kaa rup dharkar aa gaye
 The swayamvara had several taps standing simultaneously
 sabhi pareshaan the ki asli nal koun hoga
 But Damayanti was not deterred at all
 usne ankhon se hi asli nal ko pahchaan liya
 All the gods also greeted him
 is tarah ankhon main jhalkate bhaavon se hi damayanti ne asli nal ko pahachaanakar apana jeevanasathi chun liya
 The newly-married couple received the blessings of the gods
 damyanti nishadh-naresh raja nal kii maharani bani
 Both started spending time happily
 damyanti pativrataaon main shiromani thi
 Pride could never touch her
 samyaanusaar damyanti ke garbh se ek putr or ek kanya kaa janm hua
 Both children were blessed with beautiful looks and qualities as per their parents
 samay sadaa ek-sa nahin rahata, dukh-sukh kaa chakra nirantar chalata hi rahata he
 Though Maharaja was a man of tap quality, godliness and virtue, but there was a flaw in him - addiction to gambling
 nal ke ek bhai kaa naam pushkar tha
 He lived separately from the tap
 usne unhen jue ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The game started
 bhagya pratikul tha
 Nal started losing, gold, silver, chariot, Rajpat all got out of hand
 maharani damyanti ne pratikul samay jaanakar apane donon bacchon ko vidarbha desh kii rajdhani kundinpur bhej diya
 Here, he lost his everything in null gambling
 unhone apane sharir ke saare vastrabhushan utaar diye
 Came out of the city wearing only a garment
 damyanti ne bhi maatr ek sari main pati kaa anusaran kiya
 One day King Nal saw some birds with gold wings
 raja nal ne sochaa, yadi inhen pakad liya jaay to inako bechakar nirvaah karne ke liye kuch dhan kamaaya ja saktaa he
 Thinking this, he opened his clothes and threw them on the birds
 pakshi vah vastra lekar ud gayi
 Now Raja Nal was left with no clothes even to cover his body
 nal apni apeksha damyanti ke dukh se adhik vyakul the
 One day both of them were hiding under the same cloth under a tree in the forest
 damyanti ko thakaavat ke kaaran neend aa gayi
 King Nal thought, Damayanti has to bear great grief because of me
 yadi main ise isi avasthaa main yaheen chhodkar chal don to yah kisi tarah apane pitaake paas pahunch jaaygi
 Considering this, he cut half of her sari with a sword, and by covering her body with it and leaving Damayanti in the same state, they left
 jab damyanti kii neend tuuti to bechaari apane ko akelaa paakar karun vilaap karne lagi
 Disturbed by hunger and thirst, she suddenly went to the dragon and the dragon swallowed it
 damyanti kii cheekh sunakar ek vyaadh ne use ajgar kaa grass hone se bachaaya
 But the hunter was evil by nature
 usne damyanti ke soundarya par mugdh hokar use apni kaam-pipaasa kaa shikaar bananaa chaha
 Damayanti said while cursing him- 'if i have never thought of any other man except my husband King Nal, then the life of this sinful hunter should be ended now
 damyanti kii baat puri hote hi vyaadh mrityu ko praapt hua
 While wandering deviously, Damayanti reached Chedinresh Subahu one day and then to her father
 antat damyanti ke satitv ke prabhaav se ek din maharaj nal ke duhkho kaa bhi ant hua
 The two were reunited and Raja Nal also regained his kingdom

 Sami Ramanandacharya, the originator of the Ramanand Sampradaya, was born in Samvat 1236
 janm ke samay or sthaan ke bare main thik-thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 According to the information gathered by the researchers, Ramanand ji's father's name was Punyasadan and mother's name was Sushila Devi
 unki mata nity venimadhav bhagwaan kii puja kiya karti thim
 One day when she went to see in the temple, she was heard divine - o mother, be a daughter
 unke anchal main ek maala or dahinaarth shankh prakat hua
 She was very happy to receive Prasad and told the whole thing to Patidev
 ek din mata ne dekha- akaash se prakaash punj aa rahaa he
 That light fell on his face
 mata darkar behaash ho gayi
 After a while, when she regained consciousness, she got up and sat down
 us din se unke sharir main ek shakti kaa sanchaar hone laga
 In the morning, Acharya appeared in the morning
 unke prakat hone ke samay mata ko bilkul pidaa nahin hui
 On the news of birth of a child in Punyasadan ji, the entire Prayag city was overrun
 kulpurohit ne unka naam ramanand rakhaa
 Gold cradle was installed for the boy
 unke sharir par kai divya chinh the
 There was a mark of tilak on the forehead
 balak ke khilne ke samay ek tota rojaanaa uske paas aa jaataa or ‘ram-ram‘ kaa shabd karata
 This 'ram-ram' word became the basis of his genes
 is balak ke paas ekonor or kaua bhi rojaanaa aata tha
 The crow would fly away with the child's toys and give the boy a stir
 bhadon ke maheene main rishi-panchami ke din ann prakshalan kaa utsav manaaya gaya
 Pakan, kheer and laddus were placed in the plate, but the child Ramanand put a finger to Kel kheer
 mata ne thodi-si kheer mukh main khilaa di
 The child did not eat anything except that
 yah kheer hi ajeen unka aahaar tha
 One day the child went to the temple of worship while playing Ramanand
 unhone dahinaarat shankh uthaa liya or bajaane lage
 The father snatched the conch from his hand and started getting angry
 balak ramanand baahar bhaag gaya
 Later, Lord Venimadhava ordered his father to give the conch child to his dream
 praat:kaal balak ko shankh bajaane ko kaha
 From that day on, the child Ramanand used to play that conch three times a day
 paanch saal kii umr main pita ne kuch granthon ke shloke sikhaye to balak ne turant yaad kar liye
 Within a year, the child Ramanand got many texts memorized
 prayag kumbh main vidwaanon kii ek sabha hui
 Child Ramanand was also called in it
 sabhi vidwaanon ne isamen apane-apane mat rakhe
 Child Ramanand said - Just like a drop of water hangs on the lotus party, like this, on this earth
 pataa nahin kab uske jane kaa samay aa jaae? isliye baad-vivaad chhod kar bhagwaan kii bhakthi kerani chahie
 On this all the scholars and devotees praised and aarti him
 aath saal kii avasthaa main balak kaa yagyopavit karaayaa gaya
 On the day of Magha Shukla Dwadashi, the learned Brahmins gave a stick of Pallas and asked them to go to Kashi and after some time they started to return
 lekin balak ramanand lautakar aane ke liye taiyaar na hue
 So brought him to his father Pandit Aunkar Sharma's house
 pandit aunkaar sharma ramanand ji ke mamaa lagate the
 Sharma ji was happy to see his wisdom tact
 kumaar ne kuch hi dinon main chaaron veda upved ko kanthsth kar unke rahasyon ko samaj liya
 Listening to his fame, many people came to see the child every day
 ek din siddh devi ai
 They said- i have come from Kalikoh
 unhone balak se sanskrit main poocha- he kumaar, kaunsi stri he jo badi chanchal he or chitt main chuphi rahati hai? vah nae-nae padaarth laakar vyaktiyon ke saamne rakhti he
 But once someone sees it, it disappears forever
 is par balak ramanand ne uttar diya- us stri kaa naam maaya he
 Then the old lady said - marry her
 tab kumaar ne kaha- uski ichha karte hi munh kaala ho jaataa he
 a man becomes lame at the time of marriage
 vah maaya andhi bhi he
 i am a brahmachari
 saare jagat kaa kalyaan karuunga
 The old lady gave her blessing - it will happen and went to her place
 vah mata saakshaat kalika devi thim
 His father was very sad to hear this samad
 vah shandilya gotra ke ek brahman kii kanya madhavi se wo vivaah tay kar chuke the
 Hearing this, he brought the metaphysics of Kumaril Bhatt
 isame likhaa tha- ‘‘ek baar vivaah avashya karnaa chahie
 "not committing a marriage causes many sins
 is par ramanand ji ne kaha- yah karmkand kii baat he
 The one who attains knowledge and devotion in his childhood does not feel any sin
 aisa kahkar vah chup ho gaye
 The father understood that he was saying this in laughter and started preparing for marriage
 kanya madhavi ne swapn main dekha- koi devtaa kah rahaa he ki tuune ramanand se vivaah kiya to vidhwaa ho jaaegi
 Hearing this, his parents' enthusiasm was destroyed
 kanya ne jivan bhar avivaahit rahane kii thaan lee or kathor tap karne lagi
 Giving up food, she started living by eating only cloves
 use doosraa swapn hua- jisase tumhaara vivaah hone vaala tha, jaakar usee se upadesh lo to tumhaara sheeghra kalyaan hoga
 On the second day in the morning she presented herself to Ramanand with her family and started demanding mantra initiation
 ramanand ji ke manaa karne par duusare log bhi uskaa samarthan karne lage
 On insistence, Ramanand ji rang his conch
 shankh dhwani sunate hi unki samadhi lag gai
 He remembered ten lives in samadhi
 usne kaha- mujhe bhagwaan se divya gyaan mil gaya he main abhi bhagaan ke dham main ja rahi hum
 On saying this, a divine plane appeared there and she sat on the plane
 is par logon ko bada aashcharya hua
 His parents also talked about taking initiation
 is par ramanandacharya bahut lajjit mahasoos karne lage
 He became attentive sitting there
 mata-pita moorchhit hokar gir pade
 He saw the divine abode
 jahaan kumaar ramanand divya singhaasana par baithe the
 Big Dita and Rishi were praising him
 janm main unhen bhagwaan ne jo aashirwad diya tha ha bhi unhen gyaat ho gaya
 Moh Maya lost her bond
 mata-pita ne uth kar dekha, sabhi log vilaap kar rahe the
 Seeing the gallstones everywhere, Punya Sadan Ji wished to give up the body but people gave him patience
 usee samay yoga bal se maharishi raghanand haan prakat huye
 After the appearance of Atha Raghanandji of Shisht Muni, all the male women went under his feet
 unhone samadhi lagaakar logon kii samasya ko samajha
 He addressed the saintly house and said - Your virtue is great
 aapako prabhu ne radaan diya tha ki ha baarah saal tak ve aapke ghar main bal lila kaa anand denge
 Now the time is over and the Lord has gone to his world
 is par logo ne maharishi raghanand ji se ek baar darshan karaane kii baat kii to raghanand ji ne bade ram yajna kii aashyakataa bataai
 Kumar Ramanand appeared after that sacrifice
 mehísha raghanand ji ne kumaar se kaha- aapane darshan dekar hamaare yajna ko safal kiya
 Now stay here to eradicate the fallacy of religion on this land and to end the tyranny of the people
 maharishi raghavanand ji ne unhen ram mantra kii diksha dekar vidhivat vaishnav sanyas diya
 Ramanand ji started doing penance at the Panch Ganga Ghat
 logon ke zyada aagrah par vah shankh bajaakar logon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan kar dete
 a corpse came alive after hearing his conch shell
 unhen jab zyada vikshobh hone laga to unhone shankh bajaanaa band kar diya
 They started playing conch shells only once a day at the request of the people
 aadhi raat ke pashchaat ek din jab ve ganga snaan ke liye gayi to kalyug raaj unke saamne prakat huye
 His punch vessel was of gold
 kalyug raaj usamen ja baithe
 But Acharya came to know about this
 jab acharya ne unase poocha ki aap meri puja main vighn kyon daalate ho to kalyug raaj pratyaksh hokar ram mantra kii diksha maangane lage
 Ramanandacharya left his nature and gave him mantra initiation
 ramanand ji ne apane jin kaal main anekon dukhiyon or peediton ko apane arshid se thik kiya jinamein rajkumaar kaa kshay rog, raidas ko diksha, kabir ko aashirwad, naye yogi shri hari nath kii pidaa, brahman kanya bini kaa uddhaar jasi anekon chamatkaarik ghatnayen shaamil thim
 He made a Vaishnab saint by giving mantra initiation to King Pipaji of Gaganoudgarh
 unhone apane jin kaal main yawanon se hinduon kii raksha kii
 Treaty with the Emperor of Delhi to stop their atrocities
 acharya ne dharm prachaar ke liye kaashi se chalakar gaganorgarh, chitrakoot, janakapur, gangasagar, jagannathpuri aadi sthanon kii yatra kii
 Today, a huge cult of Ramanand sect is going on with his tapobal
 shri ramanand madhyayugin udaar chetana ke janmdata, bhakthi andolan ke pravartak, tathaa tatkaaleen dharmik tathaa samaajik chetana ke maardarshak the
 He contributed significantly in making India's cultural life stream flow intact
 ve vastav main kabir tathaa tulsi ke preranarot the
 The era in which Shri Ramananda took place was the period of decline of religion, culture and society in the history of India
 islam kii aandhi se bhartiya samaaj abhi sanbhal na paaya tha
 From the invasion of Timur to the invasion of Babur, there was a period of political and cultural defeat in the whole society
 shri ramanand kii ek mahatvapurn dein rambhakti ko ek vyapak saanskrithik andolan kaa aadhaar banaakar rashtriya jaagran karnaa tha
 Although Rambhakti was described in Alwar literature as early as the 9th century in South India
 parantu uttar bharat main iskaa prachaar mukhyat: gyarahavin shatabdi main hua
 Ramanuja practiced the worship of Krishna Bhakti in the eleventh century, where Sri Ramananda is further credited with Rambhakti in northern India
 sheeghra hi rambhakti kii ganga desh ke ek kone se duusare kone tak pravaahit hone lagi
 Rama's name served as a panacea for many social and cultural diseases
 rambhakti uttar tathaa dakshin main sampoorn desh kii ekta ko aabaddh karne main sahaayak siddh hua
 This awakened hope, self-confidence and self-respect in the society
 shri ramanand ne rambhakti ke madhyam se ek saamaajik kranti kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Ramanand was the first step towards a revival in a society riddled with social inequalities and external fetters
 rambhakti ke madhyam se unhone samaaj ke vibhinn virgon main saamaajik samarasata tathaa samanvay kii bhaavana paidaa karne kaa ek safal prayaas kiya
 Shri Ramanand in his famous book Sri Vaishnavamtaj Bhaskar attacked the spirit of high-pitched vogue
 shri ramanand kii kathani or kerani ke ekaatmak bhav ke prabhaav se jahaan ek ore kabir tathaa anekanek shishy ramanand ji kii vaani ke sandeshvahak bane, vahiin duusari ore rambhakti ke mahaan upaask tulsi unke prachaarak bane
 On the one hand, Kabir gave the divine message of 'jat-pant', not asking anyone, Hari to Bhaje So Hari Ka Hoi, Tulsi on the other hand spoke the nectar of 'siya Ram May Sab Jag Jaani'
 vastut: ramanand vah kar paye jo bharat ke anek vidwaan tathaa anek sant mahapurush na kar sake
 This divine conch shell of Ram bhakti became the mantra to connect the whole society
 saath hi shri ramanand ne ek prabhavi tathaa adbhut shishy parampara kaa nirmaan kiya
 No one in the entire history of the world has produced as many superior and dedicated disciples as Ramanand
 ramanand ke baarah prasiddh shishy bhakthi andolan ke mukhya prachaarak bane
 The stream of his devotion was divided into two streams
 ek niraakaar nirgun rambhakti main tathaa duusari saakaar sagun avtari rambhakti main
 One was represented by Kabir and the other was given a broad look by Tulsi
 krantikari kabir ne ramanand se nirgun ram tathaa bhakthi kaa rahasy siikhaa
 Although he did not accept Rama's notion of avatarism, he accepted God as Vrahma
 iske pramaan shri gurugranth sahab main unke ek pad se hota he jo usamen diya gaya he
 Ramanand's influence on Kabir is often accepted by all scholars that he learned the lesson of Abhay for devotion from Ramanand
 kabir granthawali main ram kaa naam 217 baar aayaa he, kabir kii bhakthi ramanand kii bhaanti jati bhed athwa varg bhed se upar he
 There is no doubt in it that if Ramanand and Kabir had not laid the foundation of hope and trust among the neglected people of Hindu society, most of them would have become Muslims
 mahakavi tulsi ne ramanand kii bhakthi tathaa advait vedant kaa samanvay kar sagun rambhakti kaa paath vishwa ko padhaayaa
 In fact, the wonderful coordination of the enlightened thoughts of the society and the thoughts of the common people is visible in the philosophy of Tulsi
 jahaan shankar kaa advaitvaad prabud vichaar kaa parichaayak he, vahaan ramanand ke bhakthi sambandhi vichaaron main jan saamaanya kii bhaavana kaa pratinidhitiv he
 The amazing coordination of the two is reflected in Tulsi
 isi kaaran unka prasiddh granth ramcharitamanas vishwa ke mahanatam granthon main mana jaataa he
 Giving importance to the dignity of religion, he influenced the stream of devotion
 at: nishkarsh rup main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shri ramanandacharya ko hi yah shrey he ki unhone prem or rambhakti ko uttar bharat main janavyapee ek saanskrithik andolan kaa swaroop pradaan kiya
 He made a new awakening in the country through Ram bhakti
 unhone bhartiya samaaj main aatmavishvaas va saamaajik chetana jagaai
 As a result, the conversion process was blocked
 jan bhashaa ke madhyam se unke dwaara failaa yah andolan sheeghra hi bhakthi andolan ke rup main vyakt hua or jise kabir tathaa tulsi ne rakshaatmak ke saath-saath aakraamak swaroop pradaan kiya
 The same continuous stream of devotion remains a source of inspiration and national awakening to the Indian society

 yah kaam kaa wo bhaag tha jiske liye 1902 main fisher ko nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 The nitrogen atoms are essentially all planar, resulting in caffeine molecules that have aromatic properties
 dicaphination ke upotpaada ke rup main aasaani se uplabdh hone ke kaaran caffeine ko aamtaur par sanshleshit nahin kiya jaataa he
 If desired, it can be synthesized from dimethyluria and malonic acid
 caffeine main avarodhan kii shakti lagbhag 29 minute kii hoti he or 273 nm par adhiktam UV avasorana kii kshamta hoti he
 Worldwide consumption of caffeine is estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance
 is gananaa se prati vyakti ke hisse pratidin ek caffeine yukt peya aata he
 Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant, and is used amateur and therapeutically to reduce physical fatigue and increase mental alertness when abnormal weakness or drowsiness occurs
 caffeine or anya mithilaksanthine vyutpaadit kaa upyog navjaat shishu ke shwasarodh or dil kii aniyamit dhadkan ko durust karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Caffeine first stimulates the central nervous system at a high level, resulting in increased alertness and awareness, faster and clearer flow of thinking, increased focus and better general physical coordination, and later with higher doses The spinal level has its effect
 ek baar sharir ke andar jane par, isaki ek jatil ras-prakriya shuru hoti he or yah anek prakriyaaon ke jariye kaam karata he, jinka varnan neeche kiya ja rahaa he
 The caffeine of coffee or other drinks is absorbed by the stomach and small intestine within 45 minutes and distributed to all tissues of the body
 pratham-kram ke gatij dwaara ise samaapt kar diya jaataa he
 Caffeine can also be ingested through the anus, evidenced by the manufacture of suppositories of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine, and chlorobutanol and caffeine
 caffeine kaa jaivik arddh jivan kaal - caffeine kii kul maatra ke aadhe ko samaapt karne main sharir ko samay lagata he - yah vyaktiyon kii umr, yakrut ke kaary, garbhavastha, kuch samarupi aushadhiyon ke anusaar vyapak rup se bhinn hota he or inke alaava caffeine ke chayapachay ke liye yakrut main anzime ke str kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In healthy adults, caffeine has a half-life of about 4
9 hours
 oral garbh nirodhak lene vaali mahilaon main, yah avadhi 5-10 ghante tak bad jaati he, or mahilaon main garbhvatee arddh jivan kaal mote taur par 9-11 ghante kaa hota he
 Caffeine can be piled up in people with severe liver disease, its half-life may increase to 96 hours
 shishuon or yuva bacchon main, arddh jivan kaal vayaskon se adhik ho saktaa he; ek navjaat shishu main arddh jivan 30 ghante tak kaa ho saktaa he
 Other factors such as smoking can shorten caffeine's half-life
 flavoxamine caffeine ke safaaye ko 91

 Caffeine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme system, in three metabolic dimethylxanthines, each of which has its own effect on the body: inamen se prayek chayapachay kaa phir se chayapachay hota he or uske baad mutr ke madhyam se ise nikaal diya jaataa he
 Caffeine immediately crosses the blood-brain barrier that separates the interior of the brain from the blood stream
 ek baar mastishk main pahunch jane ke baad, adenosine receptor ke ek gaiyr-chayanshil pratidwandvi ke rup main isaki pramukh kriya shuru ho jaati he
 Caffeine molecules are similar in structure to adenosine and bind adenosine receptors to the surface of cells without activating them
 Therefore, caffeine acts as a competitive inhibitor
 adenosine sharir ke har hisse main paaya jaataa he, kyonki yah moulik atipi -sambandhi urja chayapachay main ek bhoomika nibhaataa he or arene sanshleshan ke liye jaruri he, lekin mastishk main iskaa vishesh kaary hota he
 There is several evidence that deposition of brain adenosine is increased by a variety of metabolic stresses, including anoxia and ischaemia
 pramaan se yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki tantrika gatividhi kaa daman karke or naadiyon kii komal peshiyon main sthit A2A or A2B receptaron ke jariye rakt pravaah ko badhaakar bhi mastishk adenosine mastishk kii suraksha kaa kaam karata he
 By countering adenosine, caffeine reduces stable cerebral blood flow from 22% to 30%
 tantrika gatividhi par caffeine kaa aam taur par ek gaiyr-damankaaree prabhaav bhi padataa he
 But it has not been proven that how these effects increase awareness and alertness
 adenosine ek jatil tantra ke madhyam se mastishk main mukt hota he
 There is evidence that in some cases adenosine acts as a hypothetical released neurotransmitter, but stress-related adenosine uptake appears to be primarily produced by extracellular metabolism of ATP
 aisa nahin lagata ki adenosine kisi bhi tantrika samooh ke liye praathmik neurotransmeter he, balki iske bajaay yah anek prakaar kii tantrikaon dwaara anya transmitaron ke saath ek saath mukt hota he
 Unlike most neurotransmitters, adenosine vesicles do not appear to be packed in a voltage-controlled manner, but the possibility of such a system cannot be completely ruled out
 alag sanrachanaatmak vitaran ke saath adenosine receptaron ke anek virgon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 A1 receptors are widely distributed and act to inhibit the action of calcium intake
 A2A receptor kaa aadhariya gangliya main baari jamaav hota he, yah ek aisa kshetra he jo vyavhaar niyantran main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, lekin mastishk ke anya bhaagon main bhi paaya ja saktaa he or wo bhi kam ghanatv main
 iske pramaan hai ki A2A receptor dopemine pranali ke saath kriya karte hai, jo ki pratifal or jaagran main shaamil he
 A2A receptors can also be found in arterial walls and blood cell membranes
 ) In addition to its general neuroprotective effect, there are reasons to believe that adenosine may be more specifically involved in controlling the sleep-wake cycle
 robert mccarli or unke sahyogiyon kaa kahana he ki adenosine ke jamaav kaa praathmik kaaran lambii maansik gatividhi ke baad uneendaapan kaa samvedan ho saktaa he or yah ki A1 receptaron ke marfat jaagran-protsaahi tantrikaon kaa pravarodhan or A2A receptaron par paroksh prabhaavon ke marfat neend-protsaahi tantrikaon ke sakriyan ke dwaara ye prabhaav sambhawatah madhyasthata karte hon
 haal ke adhyayanon ne A2A ke mahatv ke liye, na ki A1 receptaron ke liye, atirikt saboot pradaan kiya he
 Some secondary effects of caffeine are probably due to actions unrelated to adenosine
 anya mithailated ksanthains kii tarah, caffeine Phosphodiesterase inhibitors camp-phosphodiesterase) inhibit enzymes, which turn cyclic AMP into non-cyclic form in cells, thus giving rise to camp in cells
 glucose sanshleshan main istemaal hue vishisht anzimon ke phosphorailation ko shuru karne ke liye chakree eempi protein kinaase a ) ke sakriyan main bhaag letaa he
 By blocking its removal, caffeine intensifies and prolongs the effects of epinephrine and epinephrine-type drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenadate
 parshvik koshikaon main sieempi ke jamaav main vruddhi se protein kinaase a ) ke sakriyan main vruddhi hoti he, jo badale main H+ / K+ atpase ke sakriyan main vruddhi karata he, parinamswaroop antat koshika dwaara gastric acid srav main vruddhi hoti he
 Cyclic AMP also increases the activity of diffuse current, which directly increases heart rate
 caffeine sanrachanaatmak rup se kuchlaa sat ke sadrush bhi he or, isaki tarah, inotropic glissine receptaron kaa ek pratispardhi shatru he
 The metabolites of caffeine also contribute to the effect of caffeine
 vasaprajnan prakriya main vruddhi ke liye paraksanthine jimmedaar he, jo peshiyon dwaara indhan ke strot ke rup main istemaal karne ke liye khun main glissrol or fatty acid chodta he
 Theobromine is a vasodilator, which increases the amount of oxygen and nutrient flow in the brain and muscles
 theophiline komal peshiyon ko aaraam dene kaa kaam karata he, jo mukhya rup se shwasanalikaaon ko prabhavit karata he or jo ek kronotrope va inotrope ke rup main kaam karke hryday gati or uski kshamta ko badhaata he
 The specific amount of caffeine to produce the effect varies from person to person, depending on the individual's body size and degree of tolerance to caffeine
 sharir ko prabhavit karne main caffeine ko ek ghante se bhi kam samay lagata he or ek halaki khuraaq ko teen se chaar ghante lagate hai
 Caffeine consumption does not eliminate the need for sleep, it only temporarily reduces the sensation of day-long fatigue
 aam taur par, adhikansh logon main satarkta or jaagran main vruddhi karne ke saath-saath kam thakaan main bhi caffeine kii 25 se 50 milligram maatra paryaapt hoti he
 Along with these effects, caffeine is an ergogenic, which increases a person's mental or physical capacity
 1979 main kiye gaye ek adhyayan ke anusaar do ghante kii lambii cycle yatra ke dauraan niyantrit logon kii tulana main caffeine kaa upbhog kiye logon kii kshamta main 7% kii vruddhi dekhi gayi
 Other studies produced even more dramatic results: in a special study of trained runners, a 44% increase in "race-pace" endurance durability and cycle endurance durability by giving 9 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram by body weight 51% increase was observed
 atirikt adhyayanon main bhi isi tarah ke parinaam aaye
 Another study found that drivers cycled 29% longer during high-intensity circuits, given 5
5 mg of caffeine per kilogram by body weight
 aparipakvata main shwasarodh kii samasya or samay se purv janm lene vaale navjaat shishuon main shwasanaliyon tathaa phefdon sambandhi displesia ke ilaaj main caffeine citrate choti or lambii avadhi ke liye laabhakaari sabit hua he
 The only short-term risk associated with caffeine citrate treatment is the temporary loss of weight during treatment, and in long-term studies of caffeine treatment in prematurely born infants
 Benefits have been seen
 aantarik guda sanvarani mansapeshiyon ko caffeine aaraam pahunchaata he or isiilie phekal asanyam se peedit logon ko isse parhez karnaa chahie
 Caffeine is relatively safe for humans, while being highly toxic to some other creatures such as dogs, horses, and parrots, they have little ability to metabolize this compound
 ghongho or vibhinn kiton ke saath-saath makadiyon par bhi caffeine kaa suspasht asar padataa he
 Caffeine also increases the effect of some medicines
 caffeine dardanivarak dawa ke asar ko 40% adhik badhaakar sirdard main aaraam pahunchaata he or sirdard kii dawa ko sharir dwaara avashoshit karne main madad detaa he, jisase jaldi aaraam miltaa he
 For this reason, caffeine has been included in many prescription drug formulas
 migraine or cluster sirdard ke ilaaj ke liye or pratihistamin ke kaaran tandra ko dur karne ke liye bhi argotamine ke saath iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Since caffeine is the antagonist of the central nervous system's receptors primarily for the neurotransmitter adenosine, caffeine is consumed regularly, so they are well adapted to the continued presence of this drug, because of the adenosine receptors in the central nervous system
 The number has increased considerably
 pehla, caffeine ke uttejnadaayak prabhaav kaaphi kam ho jate hai, is ghatana ko sahansheel anukulan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Second, as these adaptive responses to caffeine make individuals more susceptible to adenosine, caffeine intake effectively increases the general physiological effect of adenosine, resulting in unpleasant withdrawal symptoms in tolerant users
 caffeine ke locomotor uttejan prabhaavon kii sahishnutaa ke liye adenosine receptaron ke ap-regulation ke vichaar par anya shodhon ne sawaal khada kiya he, anya chizon ke alaava, tippanee kii gayi ki caffeine kii badi khuraaq se yah sahishnutaa alanghy ho jaati he or yah ki adenosine receptaron kii sankhya main vruddhi saadhaaran he or kisi badi sahishnutaa kaa byoraa nahin detaa jo ki caffeine se viksit hui he
 Caffeine tolerance or tolerance develops very quickly, especially among heavy consumers of coffee and energy drinks
 Complete tolerance to the sleep disturbance effects of caffeine develops by consuming 400 mg of caffeine three times daily for seven days
 18 dinon tak or sambhawatah usase pehle bhi, rojaanaa 300 milligram ke upbhog se paaya gaya kii caffeine ke vyaktiparak prabhaavon ke prati sampoorn sahishnutaa viksit ho jaati he
 In another experiment, complete tolerance to caffeine was found in those consuming 750–1200 mg daily, whereas incomplete tolerance of caffeine was found in those consuming higher average doses
 kyonki adenosine, hisse main, dhamni main failaav laakar rakt chaap ko niyantrit karata he, so caffeine ke pratyaahaar ke kaaran adenosine ke badhate prabhaav se sir kii rakt nalikaayen fail jaati hai, isse sir main adhik khun chale jane se sirdard or michali aati he
 This means that caffeine has vasoconstriction properties
 catacolemine kii kam gatividhi thakaan or tandra ke bhav paidaa kar sakati he
 Stopping caffeine use leads to a decrease in serotonin levels, which can lead to anxiety, irritability, inability to concentrate and lack of motivation to take initiative or to complete daily tasks; In extreme circumstances, it can also cause mild depression
 in prabhaavon ko ek saath "krash" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Perhaps withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate, sleepiness, insomnia, and abdominal, upper body, and joint pain may begin to appear within 12 to 24 hours after caffeine release, roughly in 48 hours
 The limit can be reached and usually lasts for one to five days, depending on whether the brain's adenosine receptors are unaffected by caffeine consumption
 Hkr "how long does it come to normal" level

 Four caffeine-induced mental disorders have been recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Disorders, Fourth Edition: caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disturbances, and caffeine-related disorders not otherwise specified) 
 sharir ke vajan or caffeine sahishnutaa par nirbhar, caffeine kii adhik maatra, aam taur par 300 milligram se adhik, lene se kendriya tantrika pranali ke ati-uttejan kii sthiti paidaa ho sakati he, jise caffeine intoxication kaha jaataa he, yaa bolchaal kii bhashaa main jise "caffeine jiters" kehete hai
 Symptoms of caffeine intoxication are not unlike overdoses or overdoses of other stimulants
 isamen adheeratha, bechaini, ghabrahat, ullasonmad, anidra, chehre kii tamtamaahat, adhik peshaab aana, gastrointestinal gadabadi, mansapeshi kii fadkan, soch va baatcheet kaa asambaddh pravaah, chidchidapan, aniyamit yaa tej hryday spandan or psychomotor halchal shaamil kiye ja sakate hai
 In the event of an overdose, mania, depression, decision-making disturbances, disorientation, dysregulation, confusion, hallucinations, and psychosis may occur and cause hemolymolysis

 Although fatal doses of caffeine are exceptionally difficult to meet with regular coffee, death is reported from eating caffeine pills, taking doses of more than 2 grams of caffeine can cause severe hospitalization symptoms
 iskaa ek apwaad fluvoxamine jaisi dawa lenaa ho saktaa he, jo caffeine ke chayapachay ke liye jimmevaar yakrut anzime ko roak detii he, is tarah kendriya prabhaav main vruddhi ho jaati he or caffeine kii saghanta naatakeey rup se 5 guna bad jaati he
 This is not recommended, but it is highly advisable to use caffeinated beverages less, as drinking one cup of coffee would have the same effect as drinking five cups in normal conditions
 hriday pranali par caffeine ke prabhaavon dwaara ventricular fibreelation se mrityu ho jaaya karti he
 Treatment of severe caffeine intoxication is usually only helpful, providing immediate symptomatic treatment, but peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration may be needed if the patient has a very high caffeine serum level

 The American Psychological Association) has occasionally recognized two caffeine-induced disorders, one of which is caffeine-induced sleep disorder and the other is caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, which results from prolonged caffeine intake
 caffeine-prerit neend vikaar ke maamle main, kisi vyakti dwaara niyamit rup se caffeine kii badi khuraaq lete rahane se uski neend main ullekhneey khalal daalane ke liye paryaapt he, chikitsakeey saavdhaanee ke liye yah paryaapt rup se gambhir he
 In some individuals, anxiety or anxiety arising from large amounts of caffeine is sufficiently severe to require medical attention
 yah caffeine-prerit chintaa vikaar anek rup dhaaran kar saktaa he, saamaanya chintaa se lekar ghabrahat yaa aakasmik bhay kaa hamalaa, sanakee-jabardast lakshan, yaa yahaan tak ki phobic lakshan tak dikhaai de sakate hai
 Since this condition may simulate somatic mental disorders such as fear disorder, general anxiety disorder, two-polar disorder, or even schizophrenia, many medical experts believe that caffeine-alcoholics are equally misdiagnosed
 And they are given medications unnecessarily, while stopping caffeine intake can only cure caffeine-induced psychosis
 british jarnal of ediction ke ek adhyayan kaa nishkarsh yah hi ki haalanki kabhi-kabhaar hi nidaan kiya jaataa he, phir bhi cafinism se aabaadi kaa dasvaan bhaag peedit ho saktaa he

 Caffeinated characters also performed better in memory tasks
 haalanki, ek alag adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki caffeine laghu-avadhi smriti ko ksheen kar saktaa he or tip of da tang phenomena kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 The study allowed researchers to suggest that caffeine may increase short-term memory when missing information or facts are related to the current stream of thinking, but also hypothesized that when the stream of thinking is unrelated So caffeine also serves to trap short-term memory
 sankshep main, caffeine kaa seven dhyaan kendrit soch se sambandhit maansik pradarshan main vruddhi karata he, jabaki yah vyapak-seemaa kii soch kshamtaaon main kami laa saktaa he
 Caffeine binds to receptors on the surface of heart muscle cells, leading to increased levels of camp inside cells, simulating the effects of epinephrine
 camp acts as a "second messenger" and activates a large number of protein kinase A

 The study found hyperactivity in children with caffeine mixed cola
 ek 2008 main hue adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki jo garbhvatee mahilaayein pratidin 200 milligram yaa usase adhik caffeine kaa seven karti hai unamem, seven nahin karne vaali mahilaon kii tulana main, garbhpaat kaa khatra doguna hota he
 However, another 2008 study found no association between miscarriage and caffeine intake
 britain kii food standerds agency ne sifarish kii he ki garbhvatee mahilaon ko pratidin 200 millilitre se kam caffeine - do cap instent coffee yaa aadha se do cap taaje coffee ke baraabar - lenaa chahie
 The FSA stated that the study's design made it impossible to determine whether this difference is due to caffeine itself, or other lifestyle differences other than that are probably associated with excessive consumption of caffeine, but the decision to recommend being vigilant was done
 kaisar permanent divijan of research ke dow de-kun lee ne american jarnal of obstetrics or ginocology main ek aalekh main likhaa he ki pratidin 200 millilitre yaa usase adhik lenaa, do yaa do se adhik cap lene jitna he, "isse garbhpaat kaa khatra kaaphi adhik bad jaataa he"

 The extraction of caffeine from coffee is an important industrial process for caffeine-free coffee and caffeine production, and can be done using a variety of solvents
 benzene chloroform, trichlorethailin or dechloromithen in sabhi kaa saalon se prayog kiya ja rahaa he, lekin suraksha, paryaavarniya prabhaav, laagat or swaad ke kaarnon se inkaa nimnlikhit pramukh tareekon dwaara adhikraman ho rahaa he: Coffee beans are soaked in water
 jis jal main caffeine ke alaava anya bahut tarah ke yogic hote hai jo coffee ke swaad ko badhaate hai, us jal ko sakriy charcol se paarit karaayaa jaataa he, jisase caffeine alag ho jaataa he
 After that, without extracting caffeine the coffee with its original taste can be dried and evaporated by separating the beans from that water
 coffee nirmaataa caffeine ko alag nikaal lete hai or sheethal peya main iskaa istemaal karne ke liye or bagaiyr nuskhaa ke caffeine kii goliyon ke rup main phir se bech dete hai
 Micro-carbon dioxide is an excellent non-ionic solvent for caffeine and is far safer than organic solvents, which are used as an alternative
 nishkarshan kii prakriya saral he: 31
1 degree celsius se adhik taapmaana par hare coffee beans par CO2 daalaa jaataa he or 73 atm kaa dabaav daalaa jaataa he
 In such a situation, the state of CO2 becomes much finer: it has a gas-like characteristic that allows it to penetrate much deeper into the beans, but it also has the characteristic of a liquid that dissolves 97–99% of caffeine
 phir CO2 vaale caffeine main se caffeine nikaalane ke liye ucch dabaav ke saath pani kaa chhidkaav kiya jaataa he
 Caffeine can then be separated by adsorption in charcoal or by distillation or re-crystallization or reverse osmosis
 pehle istemaal hone vaale chlorinated va aromatic vilaayakon kii tulana main ethil acitate jaise carbonic vilaayak kam swasthya va paryaavarniya jokhim upasthit karte hai
 Another method is to use triglyceride oil obtained from used coffee plantations
 kuch purvavarti sant, seventh-de adventist, carch of god anuyaayi or isai vaigyanik caffeine kaa upbhog nahin karte

 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the following about the consumption of caffeinated drinks: "the Church has never officially taken any step regarding this in relation to cola drinks, but church leaders There is advice and we now specifically advise against any drinks that contain harmful drugs, which can lead to circumstantial habituation
 jis kisi peya padaarth main sharir ke liye hanikaarak saamagree hoti he, usase bachaa janaa chahie
" Gaudiya Vaishnavas or Chaitanya Vaishnavas also generally abstain from caffeine, as they say it pollutes the mind and over-stimulates the senses
 ek guru ke maatahat aane se pehle kisi vyakti ko kam se kam ek saal ke liye caffeine se dur rahanaa jaruri he
 The main rule regarding caffeine in Islam is that its consumption is permissible, but it is worth noting that it is unqualified and can cause serious harm to one's health
 jahaan tak coffee main caffeine kaa sawaal he, imam shihab al-deen ne kaha: 'iskaa seven halaal he, kyonki sabhi chijen halaal he keval unhen chhodkar jise allaah ne haraam banaaya he'

 pracheen darshan 2
 Medieval Philosophy 3
 aadhunik darshan In ancient philosophy man's intelligence was empowered to think on every subject
 madhyakaal main isiyat kii ore se is adhikaar ko lalakaara gaya
 The main function of medieval philosophy was to investigate claims of faith and wisdom
 vishwaas kaa daawa tha ki satya kaa mahatvapurn bhaag daivi avishkaar he, vah buddhi kii samaj main aae yaa na aae ise to maananaa hi hoga
 Initially, Christian thinkers accepted beliefs of faith and wisdom as integral
 iske baad darshan ko dharm kii apeksha gaun pad diya or buddhi ko vishwaas kii daasi banaaya; ant main buddhi ne apane adhikaar par bal diya or vishwaas tathaa buddhi ke kshetra pruthak ho gaye
 William Durands said that there are two types of truth - the same principle can be true from one point of view and false from the other
 madhyakaal kaa darshan pramukh rup main vidwanmandal kaa darshan he
 It began in the eighth century; It flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries; The 13th century was its puberty period, in the 14th and 15th centuries, internal conflicts and some external causes ended it
 jo vichaarvishay teevr matbhed kaa kaaran ban gaye unamem darshanik drushtikon ke yatharthwaad or namawaad kaa sangharsh pramukh tha
 In personal situation we see many human beings, in addition to this, the suffix of human is also our idea
 is pratyay kii sthiti satta main kya he? yatharthwaad ke anusaar yah pratyay vishesh manushyon se alag astitv rakhata he; vishesh manushya to isaki apurna nakalen yaa iske udhaaharan maatr hai
 According to nomenclature, the real power belongs to particular human beings, "man" is just a name, which we give to every one of a few individuals based on some similarities
 vastav main yah yatharthwaad or abhasavad kaa jhagada tha
 Consistent with this was the difference of rationalism and empiricism
 jo log saamaanya ko maanate hi na the, unke liye sara gyaan indriyadutt gyaan tha
 This philosophical dogma led to the distinction of many principles in religion
 vivaad ke pramukh vishay ye the- Anselm is considered the founder of scholarly theory
 darshan ke itihaas main us yukti kaa vishesh sthaan he, jo insalm ne ishwar ke astitv ke paksh main di
 Kant did not accept this tactic, but said that the other tips given are variations of Anselm's device
 madhyakaal ke darshan main tamas equinas or dans scots ke naam vishesh mahatv ke hai
 He was the chief spokesperson of both sides in the intense controversy of realism and nomism
 tamas equinas kii dharna thi ki gyaan ke kuch kshetra vishwaas ke hi vishay hai; isapar bhi indriyadutt gyaan un mul niyamon kii sahaayta se, jo prayek kii sakriy buddhi main vidyaman hai, vishwa or paramatma ke swaroop ke vishay main kuch bataa saktaa he
 Duns Scotus thought that all knowledge was confined to particulars; The existence of common suffixes is nominal
 dans scots ke yogya shishy okhm ne namawaad ke prasar main safal ytn kiya
 Scholasticism became so entangled in logic that it lost its connection with religion
 dharmik vritti ke logon ko "sanshodhan" ne apni ore khinch liya
 The segregation of religion and philosophy opened the way to modern philosophy
 aadhunik kaal main manushya kii buddhi ne phir swadhin vivechan kaa kaam utsukata ke saath aarambh kar diya
 In the view of some, Bacon pointed it out, but the majority considers Decart as its founder
 darshanikon ke safal or vifal vivaad ne decort ko prerana di ki ho sake to darshan main ganit kii nischitata pravisht kare
 Spinoza and Leibniz had the same feeling after that
 england main vichaarak manovigyaan kii ore jhuke ore unhone maanav buddhi ko anusandhan kaa vishay banaaya
 Empiricism found first-class thinkers such as Locke, Workley, and Hume

 is aadhunik darshan kii teen pramukh shakhaayen ye hai- Apart from this, special issues were also considered
 decort ne samayik andeh se aarambh kiya
 Immediately he finds that this doubt cannot be a matter of doubt
 uskaa pehla sandigdh bodh yah tha- With more thought, he came to the conclusion that the existence of divine and material world is also the result of bizarre and clear thinking and therefore unambiguous facts
 sari satta do prakaar kii he - purush or prakruti
 These two are matter - completely different from each other
 purush kaa gun chetana he, prakruti kaa gun vistaar yaa failaav he
 The distinction between these two is the culmination of distinction
 barooth spinoja ne kaha ki dravya ke pratyay main ananthata nihit he
 Infinity can be only one, overall is the only substance
 anant ke anant gun hai, parantu manushya keval do gunon, chintan or vistaar, ke vishay main jaan saktaa he
 The various shapes of contemplation are called souls or creatures; Expansion shapes are physical substances

 libniz ne kaha ki dravya ek nahin, parantu ek prakaar ke hai

 aarambh main hi paramatma ne unamem aisa saamanjasy utpann kar diya ki prayek kaa aatmbodh use bataa detaa he ki dusron kii atmaaon main kya ho rahaa he
 Watches made by an accomplished watchmaker do not affect each other, but all show the same time
 decort ne dwaitvaad ko, spinoja ne advaitvaad kaa or libniz ne aadhyatmik anekavaad ko apanaaya
 John Locke started his famous book "essay on Human Wisdom" with a rejection of spontaneous, unexplained suffixes
 usne kaha ki manushya kaa man aarambh main ek kori takhti sa hota he, anubhav usapar anek prakaar ke vichaar ankit karata he
 Some of these thoughts are in the form of sensations, some are the result of contemplation of the mind
 dravya kaa pratyaksh duusare prakaar kaa vichaar he
 The mind finds some properties combined and imagines the basis of their combination, such a basis is considered as substance
 bhautik dravya main kuch gun vidyaman hote hai, kuch, bhram main usamen sthit samaj liye jate hai
 Shape, magnitude, solidity, speed are qualities of the first type; The form, the color, the juice, the smell, the words are not outside us, but are inside us
 These are called the predominant and secondary qualities respectively
 bahya dravya kaa jo pratyay ham banaate hai, vah spasht nahin hota
 They do not know how different properties are combined, nor do they know how particular properties of a group of properties flow out
 george barkale ne kaha ki pradhan gun bhi apradhan gunon kii tarah maansik roopaantar hi hai
 Except for both types of qualities, the remaining astral thoughts remain and such thoughts do not exist
 is tarah barkale ne abhautikwaad kaa samarthan kiya
 All power is with the warnings and their thoughts
 hamaara bodh, adhik maatra main, hampar thopa jaataa he; aankh kholane par main nishchay nahin karata ki mujhe kya dikhaai degaa
 The reason for this realization is the action of God
 yah kriya nishchit niyamon ke anusaar hoti he; in niyamon kaa hi praakrit niyam kaa naam diya jaataa he
 All power is made up of the warnings and their states of consciousness
 anubhavvaad main ek pag uthaanaa baaki tha, vah david hum ne uthaaya
 Hume said that the realization that experience gives us, they are all separate from each other, but there is no connection between them
 jin gunon ko ham ek saath dekhte rahe hai, unke samooh ko ek padaarth samaj lete hai
 This is the position of the knower, that too is a group of conscious states
 hum ne dravya ke pratyay ko bhav or kalpana kii rachana bataaya or abhasavad kaa samarthan kiya
 The foundation of science is on the causal-work relationship, Hume, like other relations, described the relationship as fictitious and turned empiricism into skepticism
 anubhavvaad ne is dharna ke saath aarambh kiya tha ki hamaara sara gyaan baahar se praapt hota he, hum ne kaha ki anubhavvaad main nishchit gyaan kii sambhaavna hi nahin
 Emanuel Kant tried to mix the different streams of rationalism and empiricism and shed them on a riverbed
 usne kaha ki gyaan kii kachi saamagree baahar se praapt hoti he, man ise anivaary akruti detaa he
 Kant's suffixism was not anachronistic, he believed that the contribution of the mind to the creation of knowledge is an essential part
 samvedan baahar se praapt hote hai, parantu inhen desh or kaal ke saanchon se guzarana hota he or tab ye sanyukt haakar vastu-gyaan banate hai
 Country and time are mental figures
 pratyayon kii samanta or asamanta ke aadhaar par jo nirnay banate hai, unke banane main man unhen gun, pariman, sambandh or aakaar ke sutron main bandhta he
 Kant's first objective was to protect science from the invasion of Hyam
 kuch samay ke liye usne hum ke kaaranta ke siddhant ko sweekaar kiya
 It was the criticism of this that made his goal
 kaaran-kaary-sambandh kaa astitv to asandigdh he: prashn yah he ki iskaa aadhaar kya he
 Kant agrees with Hume in the idea that it does not have its source in external events
 vah kahata he ki buddhi ise un ghatnaon par apni ore se lagu karti he or nire bahutv kii vyavastha main badal detii he
 Not only to receive knowledge, it is a creation - the work of the mind is its fundamental symbol
 "vishuddh buddhi" abhaason kii duniya se pare nahin ja sakati; jab jane kaa ytn karti he to virodhon main ulajh jaati he
 The knowledge of indirect, as it may be, is the result of practical intelligence

 For this, there should be a ruler of sufficient power
 vyaavhaarik buddhi swadhinata, amartv or aastikwaad ko manyata detii he
 Kant had said that the search for intelligence is limited in the world of perception, it should not be thoughtless in relation to the absolute
 uske peeche aanewaalon ne uskaa paraamarsh nahin mana or nirpeksh ko hi apane vivechan kaa vishay banaaya
 Hegel stated that the fundamental power is the "mind"
 vikaas main jo kram bahya jagat main hota he, vahi chintan main hota he - tark or tatvagyan ek prakaar ke hi adhyayan hai
 Ja is something prudent is truth, what is true is prudential
 vikaas kaa moulik tathy "virodh" he
 Every situation in the world has its opposition
 is virodh ke prakat hone ke baad, donon sthitiyon main samanvay hota he
 Since mind is the basis of this change, motion in general is progress
 chintan main prayek dharna pratidharana ko janm detii he or phir donon kaa samanvay ho jaataa he
 It appears from a high level in this coherence that both perception and perception were true, albeit partially true
 darshanik vivechan main is kram ke kai udhaaharan milte hai
 Rationalism was a belief, it gave rise to the notion of empiricism
 kaant ne apane aalochanavaad main donon kaa samanvay kiya or bataaya ki donon pakshon main aanshik satya he
 Each coordination creates a new perception and gives rise to a new conception
 yah kram lagaataar jari rahata he
 In relation to politics, Hegel forgot this broad rule and said that the nation had achieved its final shape in the administration
 parantu yahan vaktaa darshanik hegel nahin, apitu swadeshbhimani hegel tha
 Shappenhaver also made the pursuit of the elemental his goal
 hegel kii tarah usne bhi man ko aisa tatv mana, parantu vivek yaa buddhi ke sthaan main usne sankalp ko yah gaurav kaa pad diya- mere yaa apane sankalp ko nahin, apitu vyapak sankalp ko
 In the root world, this resolution is expressed in various forms of Prakrit Shakti, such as attraction, heat, light, electricity, etc
 vanaspati or pashu-pakshiyon ke jivan main ye vyavasthapika shakti ke rup main vyakt hota he or manushya main atmachetana kaa rup grahan karata he
 Man wants to produce happiness by nature, but in the situation in which he is lying, his efforts fail
 jivan kaa sangharsh hi aparimit du:kha ko paidaa kar detaa he
 It is not proper for a human being to lead an ascetic life except on every kind of desire or aspiration and meditate on the vast destitution of things
 hegel ne vivek ko multatv mana; use ashaavadi hona hi tha
 Shapenhaver, who believed in the core of blind resolve, was the greatest abusive of modern times

 It is known by this name that his approach is different from that of natural evolution

 The work of the intellect is the breaking of objects to facilitate behavior; It cannot see life in its true form
 antajryoti jeevanapravaah ko saakshaat dekhati he

 Two solutions to "truth" were well-known - conformism and non-resistance
 james ke matanusaar jo vishwaas jivanavyavahaar main sahaayak siddh ho, ve satya he, jo baadhak hon, ve asaty hai
 Like conduct, truth and utility are also the same in knowledge
 anurupatavaad ke anusaar satya gyaan main gyaata ke vichaar or vaastavik sthiti main samanta haati he
 Our knowledge cannot go beyond our thoughts according to non-opposition; The rest of the knowledge which cannot be thought beyond our thoughts; The idea that can be combined with the rest of knowledge is true
