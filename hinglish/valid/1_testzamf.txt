 changan684–705and 904–07 luoyang The Tang Dynasty was a dynasty of China, whose reign lasted from 618 AD to 907 AD
 inase pehle sui rajvansh kaa jor tha or inke baad china main paanch rajvansh or das rajshahiyaan naam kaa daur aayaa
 The foundation of the Tang dynasty was kept by a family called 'li' who held power in the fall of Sui Empire

 The Tang Empire made the city of Xian its capital and at that time Xian was the largest city in the world

 The Han dynasty of the East in China is so revered that the Chinese race was called Han Chinese in their name, but the Tang dynasty is considered to be their equal or even greater dynasty

 Caste is the most basic and lower class in the biological classification of organisms
 jeevvaigyanik nazariye se aise jeevon ke samooh ko ek jati bulaayaa jaataa he jo ek dusre ke saath santan utpann karne kii kshamta rakhte ho or jinaki santan swayan aage santan janane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 For example, a wolf and a lion cannot bear children among themselves, so they are considered to be of different castes
 ek ghoda or gadhaa aapas main baccha paidaa kar sakate hai, lekin kyonki khachchar aage baccha janane main asamarth hote hai, isliye ghode or gadhe bhi alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 In contrast, dogs are found in very different sizes, but any male dog and female dog can have children that are capable of producing offspring themselves
 isliye sabhi kute, chaahe ve kisi nasal ke hi kyon na hon, jeevvaigyanik drushti se ek hi jati ke sadsy samajhe jate hai
 Different castes having similarities with each other, in which the biologists believe that they originated from the same ancestor in the past and have been divided into different branches over time through evolution, are put into the same biological lineage is
 masalan ghode, gadhe or zebra alag jatiyon ke hai lekin teenon ek hi 'ekwas' vansh ke sadsy maane jate hai
 The definition of castes in modern times is also done by examining other aspects
 udhaaharan ke liye anuvanshiki kaa prayog karke aksar jeevon kaa di en e parkhaa jaataa he or is aadhaar par un jeevon ko ek jati ghoshit kiya jaataa he jinaki di en e chhap ek duusare se milti ho or duusare jeevon se alag ho
 The definition used for the term "caste" and reliable methods of identifying caste are essential for biological tests and assessment of biodiversity
 prastaavit jatiyon ke kai udaahranon kaa adhyayan aksharon ko jod kar kiya janaa chahie isse pehle kii yah ek jati maan lee jaae
 yah aam taur par un vilupt jatiyon ke liye sankshipt vargeekrut shrenee he jisaki jaankaree keval jeevashm se hi praapt karnaa mumkin he
 Some zoologists may view statistical phenomena as opposed to the traditional idea of the class of species observed in animals
 aisi sthiti main kisi jati ko pruthak rup se shaamil vansh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ekal jin pool kisanrachana karata he
 However, definitions such as dna-sequence and morphology, used to help isolate lineages that are highly related to each other, have clear limitations
 haalanki, "jati" shabd kii sateek paribhaasha abhi bhi vivaadaaspad he, visheshkar jeevakosh ke sambandh main, or yah jati samasya kehalaati he
 Biologists have given more detailed definitions, but there are only a few options used that depend on the characteristics of the respective castes
 aamtaur par istemaal kiye jane vaale paudhe or pashuon ke naam ko taxa kabhi-kabhi in jatiyon ke samaan hote hai: jaise, "sher", "walras," or "kapur kaa ped" - prayek jatiyon ko darshaate hai
 Other cases in which those names are not used: "deer" refers to a class of 34 castes, including eld deer, red deer, and reindeer
 baad vaali do jatiyon ko kabhi yah vyakhya karte hue ek hi jati mana jaataa tha ki vaigyanik gyaan badhane ke saath-saath jatiyon kii simaaen kitni parivartit ho sakati hai
 Due to the difficulties in defining both the world and calculating their total number, it is estimated that anywhere between two and 100 million / 2 to 100 million of this type can be different species
 adarsh rup main, kisi jati ko ek aupchaarik rup se vaigyanik naam diya jaataa he, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi bahut si jatiyaan hai 
 kisi jati kaa naam tab rakhaa jaataa he, jab ise vansh-varg / vansh-kram main rakhaa jaataa he
 From the scientific point of view, it can be considered a hypothesis that castes are much more related to the genus of other castes than to other lineages
 ek saamaanya jatiyon main shaamil he or / iske rup main sabase acha gyaat vargeekaran shrenee hai: jivan, kshetra, rajya, jati, varg, kram, parivaar, vansh or jati
 jinas ko iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa aparivarty nahin; koi vargeekaran vaigyanik baad main main ise bhinn jinas de saktaa he jis kaaran uskaa naam bhi badal jayega
 In biological nomenclature, a caste name has two parts, they are considered Latin, although the name and place of any native language or the name of a person can be used for it
 jati naam pehle ke baad doosraa shabd, vishesh naam soochibaddh he
 For example, the species known as the long-leaf pine is the genus Pinus palustris, whose brown wolves belong to the Canis lumpus, the Coytes canis latrans, the golden fox canis orus, and they all belong to the genus Canis
 Not only in other words, but caste names are completely bipedal

 At that time the main biological principle was that the freely represented species were originated by God and hence they are considered to be real and immutable, so that the hypothesis of common ancestry is not applicable
 pustakon or lekh main / inke sankshipt naam / rakhe jate hai or iske sankshipt naam ek vachan main "sp

 "sp

" kaa upyog karke inhen itelic nahin karnaa chahie
 It is astonishingly difficult to explain the term "caste" which applies to all natural beings and to biologists about how to interpret castes and how to identify real castes is called the caste problem
 adhikansh pathyapustakon main kisi jati "vaastavik or sambhavit antar nasl prakritik aabaadi vaale samooh" jo aise anya samooh prajnan ke taur par alag rakhe jate hai
 Various parts of this definition, such as some unusual or artificial intercourse, are excluded from it: uparokt adarsh pathyapustak vaali paribhaasha bahu-koshikeey praaniyon ke liye acchhee tarah kaary karti he lekin aisi bhi kuch paristhitiyaan hai jahaan par inhen anupyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he: Horizontal gene transfer makes the term "race" even more complicated to define
 prokerat samooh ke asmaan samoohon or or kam se kam aksar eukerets ke asmaan samoohon ke bich kshaitijiy jin sthanantaran ke majboot sakshya hai or williamson kaa tark he ki crustaciuns or ekinoderm main iske kuch sakshya uplabdh hai
 All definitions of the term "race" that all of their genes are derived from one or two parents are exactly the same as that animal, but basic gene transfer seems to be misconceived
 ek sabase badhiya prashn yah he "jati" shabd jisaki vyakhya jeev vigyaani dete aae hai or is charchaa ko jatiyon kii samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Darwin wrote in Chapter II of On the Origin of Species
 lekin baad main, darwin ne apni The Descent of Man main yah kehete hue apane mat main sanshodhan kiya ki "kya maanav main ek yaa anek jatiyaan shaamil hai"
 The modern theory of development rests on new fundamental definitions of "caste"
 darwin se pehle, prakrutivaadiyon ne jatiyon ko adarsh yaa saamaanya prakaar ke rup main dekha, jiskaa udhaaharan kisi adarsh namoonay ke saath diya ja saktaa he jisamen saamaanya jati ke samaan ve sabhi gun uplabdh hai
 The uniformity of Darwin's theory shifted attention from the simple to the special
 bauddhik itihaaskaar louis minand ke anusaar, It transforms "caste" into a new approach; Darwin vyaavhaarik rup se, jeev vigyaniyon ne jatiyon ko paribhaashit praaniyon kii aabaadi jinamein anuvanshik samanta kaa str ucch hota he ke rup main kii he
 It can reflect the adaptation of the same organism and transfer varieties of genetic material from one potential to another
 is prakaar kii paribhaasha main samanta ke sateek str kaa uprayog ekapaksheeya hota he, lekin yah praaniyon ke liye upyog kii jane vaali sabase aam paribhaasha he jisase alangik prajnan hota he, jiseki kuch paudhe or sookshm praani
 The lack of any apparent caste deficiency in microbiology has led some authors to argue that the use of the term "caste" is not correct when studying bacteria
 iske bajaay unhone jin ko dur-daraaj se sambandhit bacteria ko sambandhit bacteria ko sampurna bacteria sambandhi kshetra ko ek jin vaale pool ke saath swatantra rup se vichrate hue dekhte hai
 Nevertheless, the rule of thumb was established stating that more than 97% of the same 16S rrna gene sequence bacteria or Archaea should be examined by DNA – DNA hybridization regardless of whether they belong to the same species
 is avadharana kaa adhyatan haal hi main yah kehete hue kiya gaya he ki 97% kii seemaa bhi bahut kam thi or use 98
7% tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sexually borne organisms, where the genetic material is shared in the reproductive process, then the interbreeding process of the two animals and the hybrid offspring of both sexes are accepted as equal indicators that the animals have shared the same species
 Has adopted abundant genes as a member of
 ek prakaar se "jati" antar prajnan praaniyon kaa ek samooh he
 This definition can be extended further by stating that a caste is a group of animals capable of potentially interbreeding breeding - fish can be kept in the same species even if they live in different lakes because they Interracial breeding can occur if they have ever come in contact with each other
 On the other hand, there are many examples of three or more bizarre populations of whether animals with intercultural populations can breed interculturally in other types of populations, but on the other hand, these populations are not capable of interbreeding
 is prakaar se, yah vishay bahes yogya he ki ye aabaadiyaan ek yaa do alag-alag jatiyaan banaati hai
 There is no contradiction in that species are defined based on gene frequencies and thus have ambiguous boundaries
 natijatan, "jati" kii saarvbhaumik paribhaasha aavashyak rup se ekapaksheeya he
 Instead, biologists have given many definitions; The use of which is the perfect choice for any zoologist depends on the characteristics of that zoologist's research
 abhyaas main, ye paribhaashaayen samaan hai or unke bich ekamusth virodhabhas kii tulana main unka maamla adhik mahatvapurn he
 Nevertheless, none of the concepts of caste proposed so far are fully objective or can apply in all cases without assistance for a decision
 jivan kii jatilta ko dekhte hue, kuch kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke ek uddeshy kii paribhaasha sabhi prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon main asambhav he or jeev vaigyanikon ko sabase adhik vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 It is the concept of all biological species in most spineless animals and is largely deficient in the phylogenetic race
 kai BSC up-jatiyon ko PSC ke antargat jati mana jaataa he; BSC or PSC ke bich antar kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he kyonki BSC jati ko spasht vikasvaadi itihaas ke parinamswaroop jati ko paribhaashit karata he, jabaki PSC kisi jati ko spasht vikasvaadi sambhaavna ke parinamswaroop paribhaashit karata he
 In this way, the PSC castes were "created" as soon as the evolutionary lineage began to be separated, while the BSC caste began to emerge only when their lineage separation was complete
 tadnusaar, PSC banaam BSC ke aadhaar par vaikalpik vargeekaran ke bich paryaapt vivaad sambhav he kyonki unke taxa ke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ve bilkul bhinn hai, use baad vaale model ke antargat up-jatiyaan maanya hongi
 Life-supporting castes: Many castes are absolutely bizarre towards adaptation to the environment, as they are capable of yielding or breeding under certain conditions such as drought, desertification, flooding, soil poisoning, soil salinity, many of which are food
 , Providing materials and empowering humans, livestock and other animals are considered potentially beneficial to humans A
 These are known as life-supporting nations
 jiseki unamem parsparik mukhya jatiyaan shaamil hai kyonki inke paas bhu-akritiyon kii akhandta kii mukhya kunjee hoti he jisamen donon praaniyon ke biodeta or maanav samudaay shaamil hai
 Both ecological and socioeconomic castes are tributaries for life
 jatiyon ke vargeekaran ke saath purvollekhith samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nimnlikhit sankhya keval naam maatr kaa maargdarshan he
 In 2007, they were as follows: jatiyon kii kul sankhya : 7-100 million sahit: Among the Eukaryte castes, we could only identify them: vartmaan main, global texonomi inishiative, european distributed institute of texonomi or censos of marine life texonomi sudhaar kaa prayaas kar rahe hai or pehle se agyaat jatiyon ko texonomi system ko amal main laa rahe hai
 Due to the fact that we know only a few creatures in the living room, yet we do not have full understanding of the functioning of our environment
 professor james melette ke anusaar ham nai jatiyon kii khoj ke baavjood maamalon ko bad se badtar banaate ja rahe hai or ham in jatiyon ko abhootpurv gati ke saath samaapt karte ja rahe hai
 It also means that it must be studied and classified before acquiring a new race, since it may have already become extinct
 jatiyon kii dharna kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 This is one of the most important levels of classification for several reasons: varshon ke prayog ke baad, jeev vigyaan kii avadharana or sambandhit kshetra ke mejabaan ke rup main pramukh rahi he lekin abhi tak ise purna rup se paribhaashit nahin kii gai he
 The nomenclature of a particular caste should be considered hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship and diversity of the organisms of that group
 agrim jaankaree haath main aate hi pariklpana kii pushti yaa uskaa khandan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, especially when communication was much more difficult in the past, classification scientists working on segregation gave different names to different animals that were later identified as a common race
 jab do naam vaali jati kii khoj ek jati ke rup main kii gai, to puraani jati kaa naam aamtaur se kaayam rakhaa gaya or nai jati ke naam ko vah naam de diya gaya, ek aisi prakriya jo ekatrikaran ke rup main paryaayavacheekaran yaa bolchaal kii prakriya kehalaati he
 The division of a texon into more than one is usually called a texon
 vargeekaran vaigyanikon ko aamtaur se unke sahpaathiyon dwaara unhen "lanpar" yaa "splitre" kaha jaataa he, jo jantuon ke bich pahachaane jane vaale antar par unke vyaktigat drushtikon or samaantaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Traditionally, researchers have relied on the observation of structural differences and the observation of whether or not their differential reproduction was successfully carried out for differences in castes in different populations; Both anatomy and reproductive behavior are still important to state the status of castes
 pichley kuch dashakon main, sookshmjeevigyaani anusandhan takanic main kranti ke parinamswaroop jaise DNA vishleshan se jatiyon ke bich antar or samaantaaon ke bare main athaah gyaan uplabdh ho gaya he
 Many populations formerly considered as separate castes are now considered a taxon and the pre-grouped population is divided
 koi vargeekaran str kaa paryaayavacheekaran yaa vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or ucch texonomik str par ye sanshodhan abhi bhi bahut athaah hai
 From the classification point of view, groups in race can be defined more as Texon classification than race
 praanivigyaan main keval up-jatiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jabaki vanaspati vigyaan main vividhta, up-vividhta or swaroop kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In conservation biology, the evolutionary critical unit is used that can be defined as a segment with a caste or more small bizarre population
 vigyaan ke praarambhik kaary main, jati keval alag-alag praani hote the jo apane samaan yaa lagbhag samaan praaniyon ke samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 At that time no other relations were applicable to them
 arestu ne jinas or jati shabd kaa upyog jatigat yaa vishesh virgon ke liye kiya
 Aristotle and other pre-darwinian scientists considered castes to be special and immutable as chemical elements such as "essence"
 When the early observers began to develop the organization as a system for organisms, they began to place the segregated space beforehand
 inamen se kai praarambhik chithran yojanaon ko ab sanakee nahin mana jayega or inamen samarktata ke aadhaar par rang yaa vyavhaar shaamil hai
 In the 18th century, Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to reproductive organs
 haalanki jeevon ke vargeekaran ke unke prakaar ne samanta ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya, lekin unhone samaan jatiyon ke bich sambandh ke bare main koi daawa nahin kiya
 
 At that time, it was still widely believed that no one among the castes believed that there was any biological connection between the biological castes, no matter how similar they looked
 This approach also suggested a kind of idealism: the notion that all the existing castes are an "ideal form"
 haalanki vahaan par sabhi jeevon ke bich hameshaa hi matbhed hai, to bhi linius ne aise antar ko samasyapurna mana
 unhone alag-alag jeevon kii pahchaan karne kaa prayaas kiya jo jatiyon kaa anukaraniya tha or anya gaiyr-anukaraniya jeevon asaamaanya or apurna mana
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that caste could change from time to time, and that the history of the home gave enough time for major changes in them
 jin-baptist lamark ne Zoological Philosophy main sristi-rachana-siddhant ke viruddh pehla taarkik vichaar diya
 There was a new preference for determining how castes might change over time
 lamark ne suzav diya ki jeev kisi praapt gun ko apane aane vaale vansh main pahunchaa saktaa he jaise jiraph kii lambii gardan oonche pedo kii pattiyon tak pahunchnaa jiraph kii peedi kaa gun tha
 However, with Charles Darwin's acceptance of the natural selection idea in 1860, Lanmark's approach to goal-oriented development, also known as the teleological process, was rendered ineffective
 pashchjanan sambandhi prakriyaayein jaise mithailation ke aas-paas praapt visheshtaon ke vanshanukram main haal hi kii ruchi jo DNA kram ko prabhavit nahin karti, lekin viraasatiya tareeke se abhivyakti ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, neo-lamarckism, as it has sometimes been talked about, that the theory of evolution is not a challenge with natural selection
 charles darwin or alfred veles vah vichaar diya jiskaa paalan aaj bhi vaigyanik vikaas ke siddhant kaa sabase shaktishaalee or sammohak rup main karte hai
 Darwin argued that this included population was not just a creature
 unka tark linius kii kattarpanthi dhara ke pariprekshya kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey he:jati kii vyakhya adarsh shabd ke rup main karne kii bajaay, darwin ne jeevon ke bich antar ko prakritik mana
 unhone aage tark diya ki samasyagrastata se dur durlabh jati ke astitv ke liye vastav main uskaa spashtikaran kiya
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus' insight that the growth rate of organic populations would always be ahead of the growth rate of resources in the environment, such as the supply of food
 As a result, Darwin argued that not all organisms in the population would be able to subsist and breed
 unke dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ausatan lekin unamem antar hoga - haalanki ve use thodaa bahut paryaavaran ke anukool banaaenge
 agar ye gunon vaale antar paitruk rahe to jivit rahane waalon kaa vansh unhen dhaaran kar legaa
 In this way, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population over many generations, while the hostile traits will disappear
 is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki kya paryaavaran main koi antar anukuli he yaa gaiyr anukuli: bhinn-bhinn paryaavaran alag alag gunon kaa paksh lete hai
 Because the environment effectively chooses which creature to survive for reproduction and it is the environment that determines which qualities should go forward
 yah prakritik chayan ke dwaara vikaas kaa siddhant he
 In this model, the neck length of a giraffe would be interpreted according to the situation that the long-necked proto-giraffe acquired special reproductive traits from the short-necked giraffe
 For many generations, the entire population would have belonged to long-necked animals
 
 1859 main, jab darwin ne prakritik chayan kaa apana siddhant prakashit kiya, to us samay vanshanukram ke vyaktigat gunon vaale tantra kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Although Darwin made some assumptions about inheritance of virtue, his theory was based only on the fact that inheritance properties exist and are mutable
 haalanki grager mendal anuvanshiki par shodh-patr ko uski visheshtaon kii pahchaan kiye bina hi 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This was not done until 1900 when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Verais, Carl Correns, and Erick von Semark, when they realized that Darwin's theory had "inherited properties" genes
 prakritik chayan ke madhyam se vikaas kii jatiyon ke vargeekaran main jatiyon kii charchaa ke liye do mahatvapurn manyataayen he - ve parinaam lineyas kii texonomi ke paksh main anumaanon ko moolbhoot rup se chunauti detii hai
 At first it showed that castes are not only the same but they can also be really related
 darwin ke kuch chaatro kaa tark he ki sabhi jatiyaan aam purvaj kii vanshaj hai
 Second, it is assumed that "caste" is not homogeneous, stable, permanent things; Caste members are completely different and castes have changed a long time ago
 is baat se pataa chalata he ki jatiyon kii koi vishesh seemaa kshetra nahin he lekin lagaataar badalati jin-aavritiyon ke sankhyikeey prabhaav padate hai
 Still, one can use the classification of Linnaeus to identify plants and animals, but no one can think of an independent and immutable form of castes anymore
 paitruk vansh se kisi nai jati main vikaas hona speshiation kehalaata he
 The progeny caste has no clear lineage demarcation from its descendant caste
 haalanki jatiyon ke vartmaan vaigyanik gyaan se yah pataa chalaa he ki sabhi maamalon main vibhinn jatiyon ke bich antar sthapit karne ke liye koi thos or vyapak tarika nahin he, taaki jeev vigyaani is vichaar ke sanchaalan ko jari rakhane ke liye thos tareekon kii talash jari rakhen
 jati ke bare main sabase lokapriy jaivik paribhaasha main se ek prajnan algaav ke sandarbh main he, agar do praani donon lingon ke sankar vansh kaa prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hote, to ve bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke hote hai
 Intuitive castes have limitations in this definition, but are incomplete
 udhaaharan ke liye un jati ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he jo alangik tareeke se prajnan karte hai or use vilupt hoti ja raheen jatiyon par lagu karnaa bada mushkil he
 In addition, the boundaries between castes are often unclear: there are instances where members of a particular population breed fertile hybrid offspring of creatures from a second population and members of a second population cultivate fertile hybrids from creatures with a third population
 Can breed offspring but members of the first and third populations cannot breed fertile hybrids or only fertile offspring from parents Birth is possible
 natijatan, kuch log jati kii is paribhaasha ko asweekaar karte hai
 Richard Dakins describes the two organisms as homogeneous and if they have the same number of chromosomes and for each chromosome, both creatures have the same number of chromosomes
 However, most all classification scientists will disagree with this point
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai ubhaycharon main, vishesh rup se newjiland main, leopelma mendhakon ke jinom main "mul" jinom hote hai jo bilkul bhinn nahin hote or gaun gunasutra hote hai jo bahut se sanyojanon main maujuud hai
 Although extreme differences are found in the number of chromosomes of the population, they can successfully differentiate and form a single developmental unit
 paudhon main, poliflidi antar prajnan par kuch rokthaamon vaala atyadhik saamaanya sthaan he; kyonki praaniyon ke gunasutron ke set sam sankhya se visankramit kiye jate hai, jo vartmaan gunasutron ke set kii vaastavik sankhya par nirbhar karata he jahaan vahi vikaskaari ikai ke kuch praani kuch anya ke saath antar prajnan kar sakate hai or kuch nahin or usamen puri aabaadi ko visheshtaur se ek saamaanya jin pool banane ke rup main joda gaya he
 Classification of species is particularly affected by technological advances that allowed researchers to link their evidence based on molecular traces, to acute evidence of crude blood plasma, in the mid-20th century ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization study of Charles Sibley, In 1970, the comparison gave rise to DNA sequencing techniques
 in takneekon ke parinamswaroop ucch texonomik virgon main krantikari parivartan aayaa, jisase filogenetic ped kii bahut si shakhaon kii punarvyavastha vaale parinaam praapt hue

 The turtle was determined to develop at the molecular level with only one-eighth of the speed of other reptiles, and the rate of molecular evolution in albatross is found to be only half that of storum-petrels
 aajkal aprachlit sankaran takanic uplabdh he or anukram kii tulana ke liye or adhik vishwasaneey computesnal drushtikon dwaara badali jaati he
 Molecular taxonomy is not directly based on evolutionary processes, but overall changes are made by these processes
 ve prakriyaayein jo peedi or vividhta vaale rakrakhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai jaise parivartan, badlaav kii prakriya or chayan samroop nahin hai

 The branch of medicine that deals with the study, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cancer is called oncology or oncology
 karkat sabhi umr ke logon ko, yahan tak ki bhrun ko bhi prabhavit kar saktaa he, lekin adhikansh kismon kaa jokhim umr ke saath badhata he
 13% of cancer is the cause
 american cancer sosayadi ke anusaar, 2007 ke dauraan puure vishwa main 76 lakh logon kii mrityu karkat ke kaaran hui
 Cancer can affect all animals
 lagbhag sabhi karkat roopantarit koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth main asaamanyataon ke kaaran hote hai
 These abnormalities can be caused by carcinogens or carcinogens such as tobacco smoking, radiation, chemicals, or infectious factors
 Other genetic abnormalities that cause cancer may sometimes be due to an error in DNA cancer replication, or may be inherited genetically and thus present in all cells since birth
 karkat kii anuvanshikta saamanyatya carcinogen or poshak ke jinom ke bich jatil antarkriya se prabhavit hoti he
 Newer aspects of genetics of cancer pathogenesis such as DNA methylation and micrornas are increasingly gaining importance
 karkat main pai jane vaali anuvanshik asaamanyataayen aamtaur par jin ke do saamaanya virgon ko prabhavit karti hai
 Cancer-promoting tumors are typically active in cancer cells, giving new properties to those cells, such as increased growth and division than normal, protection from programmed cell death, lack of normal tissue limits, and diverse tissue environments
 Ability to be installed
 iske baad gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin karkat kii koshikaon main niskriy ho jate hai, jiske parinamswaroop un koshikaon kii saamaanya kriyaaon main kami aa jaati he, jaise sahi DNA pratikruti, koshika chakra par niyantran, utakon ke bheetar abhivinyas or aasanjan or pratiraksha tantra kii surakshatmak koshikaon ke saath parsparik kriya
 Typically, a pathologist has to undergo a histological examination of a tissue biopsy specimen to diagnose it, although early signs of malignancy may be signs of radiation-visual deprivation
 adhikansh karkat rogon kaa ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he, kuch ko thik bhi kiya ja saktaa he, yah karkat ke vishesh prakaar, sthiti or avasthaa par nirbhar karata he
 Once diagnosed, cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy
 anusandhan ke vikaas ke saath, karkat kii vibhinn kismon ke liye upachaar or adhik vishisht ho rahe hai
 Significant progress has been made in the development of targeted therapy drugs that act exclusively on investigational molecular abnormalities in the specific knot and minimize damage in normal cells
 karkat ke rogiyon kaa purv nidaan karkat ke prakaar se bahut adhik prabhavit hota he, saath hi rog kii avasthaa or seemaa kaa bhi is par prabhaav padataa he
 In addition, histological classification and the presence of specific molecular markers can also be helpful in pre-diagnosis of disease and in determining individual treatment
 nimnlikhit nikat sambandhit shabdon kaa upyog asaamaanya vruddhi ko namit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he: In current English, though, the term is synonymous with tumor, neoplasm, especially solid neoplasm
 dhyaan den ki kuch nioplasm, jaise rakt karkat, gaanth kaa nirmaan nahin karte hai
 The following words can be used to describe a cancer
 cancer ke 100 se adhik prakaar hai
 The type of cancer is usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancer begins, but they are also known as the type of cells from which they are made
 
 Bladder cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer leukemia cancer cancer karkat ko koshika ke prakaar ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he jo gaanth se samanta rakhti he, isiilie, utak ko gaanth se utpann mana ja saktaa he
 These are tissue science and place respectively
 saamaanya shrenee ke udaahranon main shaamil hai: Most of these bales are common in children
 durdam ganthon ke naam main aam taur par -carcinoma, -sarcoma yaa -blostoma jaise shabdon kaa upyog pratyay ke rup main kiya jaataa he, iske saath mul shabd ke rup main utpatti ke ang ke liye latin yaa greek shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, liver cancer is called hepatocarcinoma; Cancer of fat cells is called liposarcoma
 aam canceron ke liye, ang ke angreji naam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma of the breast or memory ductal carcinoma
 yahan par visheshan dakatal kaa upyog sookshmdarshi main dikhaayi dene vaale us karkat ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he, jo saamaanya stan kii vahiniyon se samanta rakhti hai
 The term duct has been used to refer to the cancer of the breast vessels seen in a microscope
 saumy gaanth unke naam main -oma pratyay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen mul shabd ang kaa naam hota he
 For example, a benign knot of the smooth muscle of the uterus is called a leiomyoma
 
durbhaagya se, kuch tarah ke canceron ke liye bhi -oma pratyay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise melanoma or seminoma
 Broadly, the symptoms of cancer can be divided into three groups: yadhyapi viksit ho chuke karkat main dard ho saktaa he, aksar yah praarambhik lakshan nahin hota he
 Each of the symptoms in the above list can be caused by a variety of conditions
 Cuttack can be a common or unusual cause for each item
 karkat bhinn rogon kaa ek varg he jo apane kaarnon or jaev-vigyaan main vyapak bhinnata rakhte hai
 Cancer can occur in any organism, even plants
 lagbhag sabhi karkat cancer dhire dhire badhate hai, karkat or cancer kii koshikaon or isaki putree koshikaon main truti utpann ho jaati he 
 Anything that replicates may possibly suffer from errors
 If error correction and prevention is not done properly, errors will persist and can also be transferred to daughter cells
 aam taur par, sharir kai vidhiyon ke madhyam se karkat ke khilaaf bachane kii koshish karata he, jaise: apoptosis, sahaayak anu, sambhavtah jeernata aadi
 However these error correction methods often fail in small ways, especially in environments where errors are more likely to occur and increase
 udhaaharan ke liye, aise vaataaran main vighatnkaaree tatv shaamil ho sakate hai jo carcinogen kehalaate hai
 Or periodic injury, or environments in which cells have not developed for their survival, such as hypoxia
 is prakaar se karkat ek pragatisheel rog he or ye pragatisheel trutiyaan dhire dhire koshika main sanchit hoti rahati hai jab tak jantu main upasthit koshika apane kaaryon ke vipareet kaary nahin karne lagati
 Errors that cause constriction are often self-amplifying, eventually increasing at an exponential rate
 udhaaharan ke liye: Thus, the sputum often explodes as a chain reaction due to some errors, these errors combined make more serious errors
 aisi trutiyaan jo adhik trutiyaan utpann karti hai, ve prabhavi rup se karkat kaa mul kaaran hai or saath hi, ye is baat kaa kaaran bhi hai ki karkat kaa upachaar bahut mushkil he: chaahe karkat kii 10,000,000,000 koshikaon main se sab ko maar dene ke baad, unamem se keval 10 koshikaayen apni pratikruti kar sakati hai yaa truti utpann karne vaale sanketon ko anya koshikaon ko bhej sakati hai to prakriya phir se shuru ho jaati he
 This rebellion-like scenario is the survival of the undesirable, where evolutionary forces themselves work against the design and system of the body
 vastav main, ek baar jab karkat viksit hona shuru ho jaataa he, yahi bal nirantar adhik aakraamak avasthaaon kii ore karkat kii pragati main sahaayak hota he, ore yah chlonal vikaas kehalaata he
 Research about the causes of cancer often falls into the following categories: karkat rog janan kaa kaaran he DNA utparivartan jo koshika vruddhi or metastasis ko prabhavit karata he
 The substances that cause DNA mutation are called mutagens and those mutations that cause cancer are called carcinogens
 kai vishesh prakaar ke padaarth vishisht prakaar ke vikshepse jude hue hai
 Tobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer, and is the cause of 90% of lung cancers
 lambe samay tak esbestus fibre ke sampark main rahane se mizothelioma ho saktaa he
 Many mutagens are also carcinogens, but some carcinogens are not mutagens
 alcohol ek rasinic carcinogen kaa udhaaharan he jo utparivartajan nahin he
 Such chemicals promote cancer by stimulating the rate of cell division
 pratikruti kii tej dar anzimon kii marammat ke liye kam samay detii he jisase DNA pratikruti ke dauraan kshatigrast DNA kii marammat ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mil pataa he, jiske kaaran ek utparivartan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Several decades of research demonstrate the relationship between tobacco use and pleural, vocal, head, neck, gastric, bladder, renal, pharyngeal, and pancreatic cancers
 tambaaku dhumrapaan main nitrosemine or bahuchakree hydrocarbon sahit pachaas gyaat carcinogen paae jate hai tambaaku viksit duniya main teen main se ek cancer mrityu ke liye uttaradaayi he, or duniya bhar main lagbhag paanch main se ek mrityu ke liye
 Indeed, the pulmonary cancer mortality rate in the United States mirrors the pattern of smoking, according to which an increase in smoking leads to an increase in pleural cancer mortality and more recently demonstrated that a decrease in smoking in men There is also a decrease in pleural cancer mortality
 haalanki, duniya bhar main abhi bhi dhumrapan karne waalon kii sankhya bad rahi he, kuch sanghathanon ke dwaara iske kaaran utpann vaali sthiti ko tambaaku mahamari ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Sources of ionizing radiation, such as radon gas, can cause cancer
 surya ke parabangnee vikiran ke lambey samay tak sampark main rahane se melanoma or anya twachaa durdamataayen ho sakati hai
 Non-ionizing frequency radiations emanating from mobile phones and other sources have also been considered to cause cancer, but there is little evidence of such a relationship
 phir bhi kuch visheshgy ehtiyaati siddhant ke aadhaar par lambe samay tak ansi chizon ke sampark main rahane se bachane kii salaah dete hai
 Some cancer can be caused by infection with the pathogen
 kai cancer ek virus ke sankraman ke kaaran hote hai; yah vishesh rup se jantuon jaise pakshiyon main dekha jaataa he, lekin manushyon main bhi aisa hota he, puri duniya main 15% maanav cancer ke liye virus hi jimmedaar hai
 The main viruses related to human cancer are human papilloma virus, hepatitis b and hepatitis c virus, epstein-barr virus and human T-lymphotropic virus
 praayogic or mahamari aankde virus kii ek kaarak bhoomika kaa sanket dete hai or ve maanav main cancer ke vikaas ke liye duusare sabase mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak ke rup main saamne aaye hai, jabaki pehla kaarak tambaaku kaa upyog he
 Virus-induced lumps can be divided into two types, those that convert rapidly and those that convert slowly
 tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale virason main virus ek atisakriy onkosin ko samvaahit karata he jise viral-onkosin kaha jaataa he or sankramit koshika v-onc kii abhivyakti ke saath tunrat hi roopantarit ho jaati he
 Conversely, in a slowly mutating virus, the virus genome inserts into the genome of the host near a proto-oncogene
 ab viral pravartak yaa anya pratilekhan viniman tatv us proto-onkosin kii ati-abhivyakti kaa kaaran banate hai
 It involves uncontrolled cell division
 kyonki pravishti kaa sthaan proto-onkosin ke liye vishisht nahin hota he or kisi bhi proto-onkosin ke paas pravishti kii sambhaavna kam hoti he, dhimi gati se roopantarit hone vaale virus, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale virus kii tulana main, sankraman ke adhik lambe samay ke baad gaanth paidaa karte hai
 The hepatitis virus, including hepatitis b and hepatitis C, can induce a long-term viral infection, which causes liver cancer in 0
47% of hepatitis b patients annually and 1
4% of hepatitis c patients per year
 liver serosis, chaahe chronic viral hepatitis sankraman ke kaaran ho yaa sharaab pine ke kaaran, yah yakrut cancer ke vikaas se sambandhit hota he or serosis or viral hepatitis kaa sangyojan yakrut cancer vikaas ke ucchtam jokhim kaa kaaran he
 Due to the transmission of viral hepatitis worldwide and the heavy burden of disease, liver cancer is one of the most common and most fatal cancers

 virus ke alaava, shodhakartaaon ne jeevanu or kuch vishesh prakaar ke karkat ke bich sambandh paaya he
 The most prominent example is the relationship between chronic cancer of the stomach and Helicobacter pylori of the stomach wall
 Although Helicobacter pylori infection develops in very rare cases, as this pathogen is very common, it is probably responsible for most of this type of cancer
 isi prakaar se kuch hormone gaiyr-utparivartajanik karsinogence kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, ve atirikt koshika vruddhi ko uttejit kar sakate hai

 Famous examples are: garbhadhaaran ke saath or keval ek seemaant rup main kuch ang daataaon ke saath is rog kaa sancharan kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he, anyathaa cancer samanyatya ek sankramak rog nahin he
 The main reason for this is tissue tissue graft rejection due to major tissue homology complex incompatibility or incompatibility
 In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells, as these antigens are different in each individual
 jab gaiyr swa pratijanon kaa saamana hota he, to pratiraksha tantra upyukt koshika ke khilaaf pratikriya karata he
 Such reactions protect against knot cell grafting by destroying transplanted cells
 In the United States, malignancy is found in approximately 3500 pregnant women annually, transmission of acute blood cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and carcinoma from mother to fetus via placenta
 Has been seen ang pratyaropan ke dwaara daata se vyutpann gaanth bahut kam paayi jaati he
 The main cause of the knot related to organ transplantation is Durdam melanoma, which was not known at the time of removal of the organ, although other cases were present
 vastav main, ek jeev se cancer aamtaur par usee prajati ke duusare jeev main tabhi vruddhi karata he jab un donon main samaan utak asangati ke jin hon, chuhon kaa upyog karke aisa siddh kiya gaya he; haalanki upar varnit sthiti ke alaava vaastavik duniya main aisa kabhi nahin hota he
 Some types of cancer have been found in organisms other than humans, which are caused by transmission of knot cells themselves
 yah ghatana stikar sarcoma se yukt kutton main dekhi gayi he, jo kenayan transmicible veneral tumor or tasmanian devil main devil chehre ke tumor kii beemaari ke rup main bhi jaani jaati he
 Cancer is basically a disease regulating tissue development
 ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye, koshika vruddhi or vibhedan ko niyamit karne vaale jeenon main roopantaran hona chahie
 Genetic changes can occur at many levels, as an advantage or disadvantage of the whole chromosome, which is a form of mutation and only affects DNA nucleotides
 jin kii do vyapak shreniyan hai, jo in parivartanon se prabhavit hoti hai
 Oncogenes may be normal genes, which appear at inappropriately high levels, or altered genes that have novel properties
 kisi bhi maamle main, in jeenon kii abhivyakti cancer kii koshikaon ke durdam lakshan praaroop ko badhaava detii he
 Lump suppressor genes are genes that inhibit the cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin aksar cancer ko badhaava dene vaale anuvanshik parivartanon ke dwaara aksham ho jate hai
 Typically, many genes need to be transformed to convert a normal cell into a cancer cell
 vibhinn jinomik parivartanon ke liye ek vividh vargeekaran yojana he, jo cancer koshikaon ke utpaadan main yogadan kar sakati he
 Most of these changes are mutations, or changes in nucleotide sequencing of genomic DNA
 anyuploidi, gunasutron kii ek asaamaanya sankhya kii upasthiti, ek jinomik parivartan he, jo ek utparivartan nahin he or isamen samasutri vibhaajan main truti ke dwaara ek yaa adhik gunasutron kaa laabh yaa haani shaamil ho sakati he
 Large-scale mutations include damage or growth of a part of a chromosome
 Genomic amplification occurs when a cell acquires multiple copies of a small chromosomal locus, typically containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material
 sthanikaran tab hota he jab do alag alag gunasutri kshetra asaamaanya rup se, ek vishisht sthaan par sangalit ho jate hai
 a well-known example of this is the localization of the Philadelphia chromosome or chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in acute marrow-induced blood cancers, resulting in the production of the bcr-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase
 chote paimaane ke utparivartanon main shaamil hai bindu utparivartan, kami yaa badhotari, jo ek jin ke pravartak main ho sakati he, yah isaki abhivyakti ko prabhavit karti he
 Or can occur in the sequence coding of a gene and alter the stability or function of its protein product

 Over-genetics is the study of the regulation of gene expression through chemical, non-mutagenic changes in DNA architecture
 cancer rogajanan main adhi-anuvaanshiki kaa siddhant he ki DNA main gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartan jin abhivyakti main parivartan kar dete hai
 In general, oncogenes are silent, for example due to DNA methylation
 is methilikaran main kshati onkosin kii vipathi abhivyakti ko prerit karti he, jo cancer rogajanan kaa kaaran he
 Known systems of over-genetic transformation include DNA methylation and methylation or acetylation of linked histone proteins at specific positions on the chromosomal DNA
 chikitsa ke varg jo HDAC sandamak or DNA mithail transfarej sandamak ke rup main jane jate hai, ve cancer koshika main adhi-anuvaanshik sanketan ko punah niyamit kar sakate hai
 Oncogenes promote cell growth in many ways
 kai hormone bana sakate hai, yah koshikaon ke bich ek rasinic sandeshvahak hota he jo samasutri vibhaajan ko prerit karata he, jiskaa prabhaav grahi utak yaa koshika ke sanket pargaman par nirbhar karata he
 In other words, when a hormone receptor is stimulated on a recipient cell, the signal is transported from the cell surface to the nucleus of the cell, affecting some changes in gene transcription regulation at the central level
 kuch onkosin khud sanket pargaman tantra kaa bhaag hote hai, yaa koshikaon or utakon main sanket grahi kaa ek bhaag hote hai, is prakaar se aise hormonon kii samvedansheeltaa ko niyantrit karte hai
 Oncogenes often produce mitosis, or engage in the transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which makes proteins and enzymes, these proteins and enzymes are responsible for the production of products and biochemicals with which cells interact and which Cells use
 aadya-onchogin main utparivartan, jo saamanyatya onchogin ke sthir samakaksh hai, unki abhivyakti or kriya ko sanshodhit kar sakate hai or utpaada protein kii kriya yaa maatra ko badhaate hai
 When this happens, proto-oncogenes become oncogenes and this infection disturbs the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, allowing uncontrolled cell growth
 chaahe sambhav bhi ho jaye to bhi jinom main se aadya-onkosin ko hataa kar cancer ki sambhaavna ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki ve jeev kii vruddhi, marammat or samasthaapan ke liye jatil hote hai
 This only happens when they mutate and the signs of growth become excessive
 cancer anusandhan main paribhaashit kiye jane vaale pehle onkoseenon main se ek he raas onkosin
aadya-onkosin ke raas parivaar main utparivartan bahut aam hai, ye sabhi maanav ganthon ke 20% se 30% main paae jate hai
 Ras was originally identified in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome, and researchers were surprised to find that it not only had this gene presence in the human genome, but was also linked to a catalytic control element that induced cancer in cell line culture

 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaala jin prachurodabhavan virdohi sanketon or proteinon ke liye anukoden karata he, jo samasutri vibhaajan or koshika vruddhi kaa shaman kar dete hai
 In general, knot suppressor genes are transcription factors that are activated by cellular stress or DNA damage
 aksar DNA kshati ke kaaran mukt-utplavi anuvanshik padaarth kii upasthiti or saath hi anya lakshan dekhe ja sakate hai, jo aise anzimon or maarg ko prerit karte hai jo gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke sakriyan ke liye uttaradaayi he
 The function of such genes is to control the progression of the cell cycle for DNA repair, which prevents the mutation from being transferred to the daughter cell
 p53 protein, jo sabase zyada adhyayan kiye gaye gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon main se ek he, ek pratilekhan kaarak he jo hypoxia or parabangnee vikiran kshati sahit kai koshikeey tanavkaariyon ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 The knotting function of its knot has not been well understood, except for about half of all cancers involved in the p53 conversion
 spasht rup se p53 ke do kaary hai: ek pratilekhan kaarak ke rup main ek nabhikeey bhoomika or doosraa koshika chakra, koshika vibhaajan or apopatosis viniman main koshika dravyi bhoomika
 According to the Warburg hypothesis, glycolysis is the preferred use of energy for the growth of cancer
 p53 shwasan se glycolitic path ko sthanantaran kaa niyaman karata he
 However, a mutation can itself damage the knotting gene by "closing it" or the signaling pathway that activates it, the invariable consequence of which DNA repair is disrupted or inhibited
 : Accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage definitely causes cancer
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon ke utparivartan jo janan str koshikaon main utpann hote hai, ve santati main sthanantarit ho jate hai or agali pidhiyon main cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaa dete hai
 Members of these families have increased such incidence and this has decreased the latency of multiple tumors
 gaanth ke prakaar gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale utparivartan ke prayek prakaar ke liye praroopik hote hai, kuch utparivartan vishesh prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai, jabaki anya utparivartan anya prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai
 The type of inheritance of a mutant tumor sedative is that an effective member inherits a defective copy from one parent and the normal copy from another parent
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vyakti jo ek utparivarti p53 elil ko vanshaagat rup se praapt karata he vah melanoma or agnashyi cancer viksit kar saktaa he jo lee-frameni syndrome kehalaata he
 Other hereditary knot suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations related to retino blastoma and APC gene mutations associated with adenopolyposis large intestine cancer
 Adenopolyposis large intestine cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in the large intestine in childhood, which is relatively Produce cancer of the large intestine at an early age
 ant main, BRCA1 or BRCA2 main vanshaagat utparivartan stan cancer kii praarambhik shuruyaat kaa kaaran banate hai
 In 1971, it was proposed that the development of cancer depends on at least two mutation events
 nudsan kii do chot kii pariklpana ke anusaar ek gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin main ek vanshaagat janan str utparivartan cancer ko keval tabhi utpann karegaa jab jeev ke jivan main baad main koi anya utparivartan ghatit hota he, yah us gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke anya elil ko niskriy kar degaa
 Typically, oncogenes are effective, as they involve the action-of-gain mutation, while mutated tumor sedatives are ineffective, as they involve the action-of-loss mutation
 har koshika main samaan jin kii do pratilipiyaan hoti hai, inamen se prayek pratilipi abhibhavak se praapt kii jaati he or adhikansh maamalon ke antargat ek vishesh proto-onkosin kii keval ek pratilipi main kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan, us jin ko ek vaastavik onkosin banane ke liye paryaapt hota he
 On the other hand, the function-of-loss mutation needs to occur in both copies of the knot suppressor gene to make the gene completely dysfunctional
 haalanki, aise maamle hai jinamein gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii ek utparivartit pratilipi anya junglee-prakaar pratilipi ko kriyaaheen bana detii he
 This phenomenon is called dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations
 nudsan ke do chot ke modal ko haal hi main kai jaanchakartaaon dwaara chunauti di gai he
 Deactivation of one allele of some genes that suppress the knot is sufficient to produce a tumor
 yah ghatana agunit aparyaaptta kehalaati he or ise kai prayogtmak drushtikonon ke dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The onset of a knot resulting from haploid insufficiency is usually late, when it is compared to a two-injury process

 During this time, the biological behavior of pre-malignancy cells gradually changes from normal cell to cancer cell
 sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se purv durdam utak main vibhedak gun dekhe ja sakate hai
 Differential features include increased number of dividing cells, variation in nucleus size and shape, differentiation in cell size and shape, decrease in the properties of specialized cells and loss of normal tissue organization
 Dyspepsia is an unusual type of extra-cell proliferative building that is reflected by normal tissue system and loss of cell structure in pre-malignant cells

 The most severe cases of malignancy are called "in situ carcinoma"
 latin main, "swasthani " shabd kaa arth he "sthaan main", isliye carcinoma swasthani shabd kaa arth he koshikaon kii aniyantrit vruddhi jo apane mul sthaan par hi bani rahati he or jisane anya utakon par koi akraman nahin darshaya he
 Nevertheless, carcinoma in situ can develop into an aggressive malignancy and is usually removed by surgery if possible
 jis tarah se jaanwaron kii aabaadi main vikaas hota he, thik usee tarah koshikaon kii aniyantrit aabaadi main bhi vikaas hota he
 This undesirable process is called somatic development and in this way cancer arises and becomes more painful
 koshikeey upaapachay main adhikansh parivartan jo koshika main aniyamit tareeke se vibhaajan kaa kaaran hai, ve koshika mrityu kaa kaaran hote hai
 However once the cancer starts, the cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: some cells with new genetic changes that multiply continuously to promote their life and reproduction and develop quickly
 The knot becomes dominant, as cells with less adapted genetic changes are out of competition
 isi prakaar se MRSA jaise rogajanak pratijaivik-pratirodhi ban jate hai or yahi kaaran he ki fasalon ke blit or keet kitnashak pratirodhi ban jate hai
 Due to this development, cancer recurrence consists of cells that acquire resistance to cancer drugs

 Recent studies of CT scan-based screening for lung cancer in smokers have yielded equivocal results, since July 2007, systematic screening is not recommended
 sade-film ke chaati ke eks re ke yadricchik naidanik pareekshan, jo dhumrapaan karne waalon main fefdon ke cancer ke liye screen karte hai, is drushtikon ke liye laabhakaari sabit nahin hue hai
 Canine cancer screening has accurate results, but it is still in the early stages of research
 adhikansh cancer yaa to apane lakshanon or sanketon ke dwaara praarambhik rup se pahachaane jate hai yaa screening ke dauraan prakat hote hai
 None of these are definitive diagnoses, which usually require the advice of a pathologist, this pathologist must be a type of physician who specializes in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases
 jin logon main cancer kaa andeh hota he unki chikitsa pareekshan ke dwaara jaanch kii jaati he
 Common tests include blood tests, x rays, CT scans, and observation
 kai kaarnon se cancer kaa andeh ho saktaa he, lekin adhikansh durdamataaon kaa nishchit nidaan ek rog vigyaani ke dwaara cancer kii koshikaon ke utak vaigyanik pareekshan ke dwaara sunishchit kiya janaa chahie
 The tissue can be obtained by biopsy or surgery
 kai biopsy ek chikitsak ke karyaalay main hi kii ja sakati hai
 Biopsy of other organs is performed in the presence of an anesthetic, which requires surgery in the surgical chamber
 rog vigyaani ke dwaara die gaye utak nidaan prachurodbhavan karne vaali koshika ke prakaar ko bataate hai
 At the same time, the tissue scientist category of the knot also clarifies genetic abnormalities and other symptoms
 saath hi, yah jaankaree rogi ke purv nidaan kaa moolyankan karne main tathaa sarvottam ilaaj kaa chayan karne main upyogi he
 Cell genetics and immune tissue chemistry are other types of tests that a pathologist can perform on a tissue sample
 ye pareekshan un anvik parivartanon ke bare main jaankaree uplabdh kara sakate hai jo cancer kii koshika main hue hai or is prakaar se cancer ke bhavi vyavhaar or sarvottam upachaar ko bhi ingit karte hai
 Cancer can be treated by surgery, surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy or other methods
 therapy kaa chayan gaanth kii sthiti or shrenee tathaa rog kii avasthaa par nirbhar karata he, saath hi rogi kii saamaanya avasthaa par bhi nirbhar karata he 
kai prayogtmak cancer upachaar bhi viksit ho rahe hai
 The purpose of treatment is to eliminate cancer completely without harming the body
 kabhi kabhi ise shalya chikitsa ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he, lekin cancer kii aas-paas ke utakon par akraman karne kii pravriti yaa sookshm metastasis dwaara dur ke sthanon par fail jane kii pravriti aksar isaki prabhavita ko simit kar detii he
 The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by the toxicity of other tissues in the body
 vikiran saamaanya utakon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Because "cancer" refers to a class of diseases, it is unlikely that "cancer will always be the only treatment", yet there is only one treatment for all infectious diseases
 saidhantik rup se gaiyr hemetological cancer kaa ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he yadi ise puri tarah se shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa diya jaae, lekin yah sadaa sambhav nahin he
 When the cancer reaches other parts of the body by metastasis before surgery, it is usually impossible to completely remove it by surgery
 cancer kii pragati ke halsted namoonay main, gaanth sthanik rup se babbti he, fir lasika parvon tak fail jaati he or fir sharir ke anya sabhi bhaagon main
isi kaaran se chote canceron ke liye sthanik upachaar jaise shalya chikitsa kii lokapriyata bad gai he
 Even small localized tumors have a very high capacity for metastasis
 cancer ke liye shalyachikitsa kii prakriyaaon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai- stan cancer ke liye stanochhedan or prostate cancer ke liye prostate-chhedan 
 shalya chikitsa kaa lakshya hota he yaa to keval gaanth ko hataanaa yaa puure ang ko nikaal dena
ek cancer koshika nagn ankhon ke liye adrishy hoti he, lekin fir se vruddhi kar ke nayi gaanth bana sakati he, yah prakriya punrariti kehalaati he
 For this reason, pathologists examine surgically extracted specimens that, if healthy tissue limits are present, reduce the likelihood that microscopic cancer cells may remain in the patient's body
 praathmik gaanth ko nikaalane ke alaava, aksar shalya kriya avasthaa nirdhaaran ke liye aavashyak hoti he udhaaharan rog kii seemaa kaa nirdhaaran or is baat kaa nirdhaaran ki yah metastasis ke dwaara kshetreey lasika parvon tak pahunch gaya he yaa nahin
 Conditioning is the main determinant of pre-diagnosis and the need for collaborative therapy
 aksar, meru rajju sampeedan yaa antra baadha jaise lakshanon ko niyantrit karne ke liye shalya chikitsa jaruri hoti he
 This is known as mitigation treatment
 vikiran chikitsa main cancer kii koshikaon or sankuchit ganth ko nasht karne ke liye ynikaran vikiran kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be controlled externally by external ray radiotherapy or can be controlled internally through brachytherapy
 vikiran chikitsa kaa prabhaav sthanikrut hota he or chikitsa kiye jane vaale kshetra tak hi simit rahata he
 Radiation therapy damages or destroys the cells of the area to be treated, in this action the genetic material of these cells is destroyed to prevent further division and growth in the cells
 And destroy both normal cells, most normal cells recover from the effects of radiation and begin to function properly Are
 vikiran chikitsa kaa lakshya he adhik se adhik cancer koshikaon ko nasht karnaa, jabaki aas-paas ke swasth utakon ko hone vaale nuksaan ko simit karnaa
 Therefore, it is given in many parts, which gives healthy tissues a chance to recover in the intervening period
 vikiran chikitsa, kaa upyog lagbhag har prakaar kii thos ganth ke upachaar ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen mastishk, stan, garbhashay greeva, galaa, fefde, agnyashay, prostate, twachaa, pet, garbhashay, yaa komal utak sarcoma ke cancer shaamil hai
 Radiation therapy may also be used in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma
 prayek site ke liye vikiran kii khuraaq kai karkon par nirbhar karti he, ye kaarak hai, har prakaar ke cancer kii radio samvedansheeltaa or aas-paas ke utak yaa ang vikiran se nasht ho sakate hai yaa nahin
 Thus, in every type of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects
 rasochikitsa main un dawaaon se cancer kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he jo cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht kar sakati hai
 In current usage, the term "cookery" is used for cytotoxic or cytotoxic drugs that, unlike targeted therapies, affect rapidly dividing cells in general
 
 rasochikitsa dawaaen bhinn sambhav tareekon se koshika vibhaajan main baadha daalati hai, udhaaharan DNA kii pratikruti se yaa nav nirmit gunasutron ke pruthakkaran se
chemotherapy ke adhikansh rup tezi se vibhajit hoti hui sabhi koshikaon ko lakshya banaate hai, ye keval karkat kii koshikaon ke liye vishisht nahin hai, yadhyapi kuch vishistataa is vajah se aa jaati he ki adhikansh karkat kii koshikaayen diene kshati kii marammat main sakasham nahin hoti hai jabaki saamaanya koshikaon main aam taur par par ye kshamta hoti he
 Therefore, the cook has the potential to damage healthy tissues, especially tissues that have a high replacement rate
 These cells usually repair themselves after the surgery
 kyonki kuch dawaaen akele kii tulana main ek saath behatar kaary karti hai, isliye ek hi samay par do yaa adhik dawaaen di jaati hai
 This is called "combination cookery"; Most cook regimen regimens are given in combination only
 kuch prakaar ke leukemia or lasicarbud ke upachaar ke liye chemotherapy kii ucch khuraaq kii yaa puure sharir ke vikirnan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This treatment separates the bone marrow and hence the ability of the body to recover and reconstitute blood is severed
 is kaaran se, therapy ke pruthakkaran prabhaav se pehle asthi majja, yaa paridhiy rakt stambh koshika harvesting kii jaati he taaki upachaar ke baad "bachaav" sambhav ho
 This is known as autologous stem cell transplantation
 vaikalpik rup se, ek milan kiye gaye asambandhit daata se lee gayi hemetopoctic stem koshikaayen pratyaropit kii ja sakati hai
 Targeted therapy, which first became available in the late 1990s, had major effects in the treatment of several types of cancer and is currently a much more active research area
 isamen aise karkon kaa upyog shaamil he jo cancer koshikaon ke protein ko aniyamit karne ke liye vishishtikrut hote hai
 Small molecule targeted treatment drugs are usually inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, over-expressed, or other complex proteins within cancer cells

 Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the treatment factor is an antibody that binds exclusively to a protein on the surface of cancer cells
 udaahranon main shaamil hai stan cancer main prayukt kiya jane vaala anti- HER2 / neu pratirakshi trastucumeb or kai prakaar kii B-koshika durdamataaon main prayukt kiya jane vaala anti CD-20 pratirakshi rituximeb
 Targeted therapy may also include small peptides as a "homing device", which can form dams with the affected extracellular matrix around the knot or with receptors on the cell surface
 radio newclid jo in papteedon se jude hote hai, antat cancer koshika ko maar dete hai yadi newclid koshika ke aas paas apaghatit ho rahaa he
 In particular, oligo- or multimers of these bound materials are very important, as they increase the specificity and elongation of the knot
 prakaash gatik chikitsa cancer ke liye tihara upachaar he jisamen prakaash samvedak, utak oxigen, ore prakaash shaamil hai
 PDT is used for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma or lung cancer; PDT can also be useful in removing residual tissue residues after a large tumor is surgically removed
 cancer pratiraksha therapy bhinn chikitsa ranneetiyon kaa ek samooh he jise rogi ke apane pratiraksha tantra ko prerit karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he taaki vah gaanth se lard sake
 There are several methods to induce an immune response against the knot, these are intercostal BCG immunotherapy for superficial cystic cancer, and the use of interferone and other cytokines to induce immune responses in patients with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma
 Intensive research is being conducted on the vaccines to produce an immune response specific to several types of lumps, particularly malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma
 sipulukal-t prostate cancer ke liye aadhunik naidanik pareekshanon main ek vexine kii tarah kii ranneeti he, jisamen rogi se lee gayi drumashmi koshikaon ko prostetic amla phosphetege peptids ke saath lod kiya jaataa he, taaki prostate-vyutpann koshikaon ke khilaaf vishesh pratiraksha pratikriya ko prerit kiya ja sake
 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of immune therapy, as donor's immune cells frequently invade the knot under a graft-versus-knot effect
 isiilie, elloginenic HSCT, kai prakaar ke cancer ke liye autologus pratyaropan kii tulana main upachaar kii ucch dar kaa kaaran banati he, yadhyapi parshv dushprabhav bhi adhik gambhir hote hai

 In certain types of cancers, the administration of hormones is relaxing, such as progestogen may be beneficial in medical terms
 vahikajanan jo tumor ko jivit rahane ke liye jaruri he
 Some, such as bevacizumab, have been recognized and are being used in medical use
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaon ke saath ek mukhya samasya yah he ki kai kaarak saamaanya or cancer yukt koshikaon main rakt vahiniyon kii vruddhi ko uttejit karte hai

 parishkrut antiemetics jaise ondencetron or ainalogus, saath hi aprepitint ne cancer rogiyon main ugr upachaar ko adhik sambhav bana diya he
 Chronic pain due to cancer is always due to continuous tissue damage that is related to the disease or treatment process
 Although effective disturbance also plays a role in the production of environmental factors and pain behaviors, patients with cancer pain are generally prominent
 Etiological reasons are not
 iske alaava, cancer se sambandhit bhayankar dard se yukt adhikansh rogi apane jivan kii antim avasthaa main hote hai or unhen prashamak chikitsa kii zarurat hoti he
 Issues such as social stigma of drug use, work and functional status and health care are not more important in overall case management

 Belief in Islamic theology refers to a believer's belief in the spiritual aspects of Islamic theology
 isaki sabase saral paribhaasha vishwaas ke chah lekhon main vishwaas he, jise "arkan al-imaan" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It means faith in the six themes of Islam's faith
 imaan shabd quran or haddees-e-jibril donon main chitrit kiya gaya he
 According to the Quran, Imaan must be accompanied by religious deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into heaven
 jibril kii haddees main, islamic dharm ke ayaamon kaa nirmaan yah teen karte hai "islam" "ihasaan" or "imaan"
 Within and outside Islam, religion is discussed for faith and purpose, and the relative importance of both cannot be forgotten
 kai vidwaanon kaa tark he ki ek hi strot or jagah se vishwaas or hetu donon utpann hote hai isliye donon ko saamanjasypurna hona chahie
 In Arabic, Iman, the pronunciation means "faith"
 yah kriya sangya he, آمن, matlab kisi chiz main vishvas rakhana
 In the Hadith, Muhammad Sahib defined as "the meaning of Iman - wisdom in the heart, voice on the tongue, and activity in the hands and feet"
 vishwaas ek bharosa he sachai par jo vaastavik he
 When people believe, they attach themselves to that truth
 sachai jaananaa hi kaaphi nahin he, dil use maananaa bhi chahie, jeebh dwaara vyakt kii jaani chahie jo buddhi kii abhivyakti he or ant main unke aatmavishvaas ko pratibimbit karne ke liye us kaa amal karnaa bhi zaruri he
 Hamiduddin Farahi, in his tafsir, explaining the meaning of Iman, wrote: vishwaas aam taur par vishwaas ke chah lekhon kaa upyog karke ullikhit he: The first of these is mentioned by the Qur'an and the first five by Muhammad, while a doctrine of belief in Allah - the good and the bad of God-ordered destiny - refers to all six in the following way in the Hadith of Gabriel: mohammad se bhi ek or samaan varnan he: "ibn Abbas narrated that Malak Jibril once asked the Prophet:" Tell me what is Iman? "the Prophet replied:" Iman is to believe in Allah, on the Day of Judgment, on His Malaika, books and prophets, And to believe in life after death, and to believe in heaven and hell, and on the establishment of the Mizan which is to weigh our karma, and believe in destiny, on its good and evil
 jibril ne phir un se poocha: "yadi main yah sab karata hum to main imaan ke saath rahoonga?" paigambar ne kaha: " jab aapane yah sab kiya he, to aap imaan main honge
 " yah bhi mana jaataa he ki aavashyak imaan main pehle 3 chize hoti hai 
 In the Quran, one of the 10 virtues is Imaan which one gets due to becoming the recipient of Allah's mercy and reward
 quran kahata he ki vishwaas allaah ke samaran ke saath bad saktaa he
 The Quran also says that in this world there should be nothing but faith that is dear to Momin
 mohammad ne kaha he ki; usne vishwaas kii mithaas praapt kii jo allaah ko ishwar islam ko dharm or mohammad ko paigambar ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 He also said that no one can be a true believer until he loves the Prophet more than his children, parents and relatives
 ek or udhaaharan main, unhone tippanee kii he ki yah allaah or mohammad ke saath prem karne ke baad hi ek vyakti vishwaas ke asli swaad se avgat ho saktaa he
 Amin Ahsan Islahi, one of the Quran's emissaries, has clarified the nature meaning of this love: 

prem keval kisi kii patni, bacchon or anya rishtedaaron ke liye swaabhaavik rup se bhavuk pyaar kaa sanket nahin detaa he, balki yah kuch drushtikon or buddhi or siddhanton ke aadhaar par prem ko bhi sanderbhit karata he
 It is because of this love that a person, in every sphere of life, gives priority to this attitude and principle
 agar vyakti apanai patni, bacchon or rishtedaaron kii maang is drushtikon kii maangon se juujhati he, to vah bina kisi hichkhichahat ke is kaa paalan karata he, isi imaani prem ke kaaran uski patni or bacchon kii ichchhaaon or unke parivaar or kabeeley kii maangon ko kam kar detaa he
 Both Islahi and Maududi have speculated that the Quran's comparison of a good word and a bad word in chapter 14 is actually a comparison of faith and unbelief
 is prakaar, quran prabhavi rup se ek ped par vishwaas kii tulana kar rahaa he jisaki jaden mitti main gahari hai or akaash kii vishalata main shakhaaen faili hui hai
 There is also the subject of a prayer made by Iman Muhammad to Allah: he allaah! maine apane aap ko thukraayaa he or khud ko aap ke hawaale saunp diya he, or main ne aapaki badhaai pahchaan kar pehle aapke sharan main aagaya hoon, aap se bhaag kar kahin bhi sharan milane vaala nahin he
 If you are with anyone then prabhu! maine aapaki pustak main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane prakat kiya he or paigambar main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane paigambaron ke rup main bheja he
 Imam al-behiqi has compiled in his book Shu'ab al-iman that there are 77 branches of faith
 isamen, vah imaan ke aavashyak gunon ko samajhaate huve kurani aaayaaton or nabi kii hadison kaa ullekh kiya he, jo vishvas ko darshaate hai
 The following hadith is based on Muhammad Sahib: abu huraira ne suna he ki paigambar ne kaha tha: "imaan main 70 se adhik shakhaaen hai
 The most excellent of these branches is to read "la Ilaha Ilallah", and the shortest branch is to remove the obstacle read in the way
 or haya imaan kii ek mahatvapurn shakha he
 " islam main, yah aavashyak he ki vishwaas or karmon ke bich sadbhaav or samanvay maujuud ho
 Farahi has explained this aspect in his tafsir in the following way: vishwaas ke baad quran main dharmik karmon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he 


 vishwaas ke maamle main, isaki vyakhya kii aavashyaktaa spasht he: vishwaas kii jagah dil or buddhi he
 In matters of intelligence and heart, not only can a person deceive others but sometimes he himself can be deceived
 vah khud ko ek mumin maanata he jabaki vastav main vah nahin he
 For this reason, it requires two evidences: a person's words and a person's deeds
 chunki shabd asaty ho sakate hai, isliye ek vyakti jo keval shabdon ke madhyam se vishwaas kaa daawa karata he use muman ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he or ise aavashyak samajha jaataa tha ki ek vyakti ke karm bhi uske vishwaas kii gavaahi den
 Thus the Quran said: o you believe with the tongue! Trust through your actions
 islam main tark or vishwaas ke bich sambandh sadiyon se faili ek jatil bahes he
 Ismail Raji al-farooqi explains on this subject: gaiyr-musalmaan islam ke siddhanton kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 However, they should be aware that Islam does not offer its doctrines specifically to those who believe or want to believe
 islam is ko tarksangat rup se, tarksangat rup se pesh karata karata he
 It introduces us to the necessary grounds with logical and consistent arguments
 vyaktigat swaad, yaa vyaktiparak anubhav ke saapeksh aadhaar par asahmat hona hamaare liye vaid nahin he
 2118 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2118 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he

 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
