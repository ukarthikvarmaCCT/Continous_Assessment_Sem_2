 "snowbelen concluded that Newton had at least one Socinian sympathizer, possibly an anti-trinity, almost certainly the Arrian
 —teen purvji rup jo aaj uniterianvaad kehalaate hai
 In an era noted for his religious intolerance, there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably, his refusal to obey holy orders, and to take the sacrament when he was about to die
 And he refused

 unhone bible ke andar chupe hue sandeshon ko khojane kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 In his own lifetime, Newton wrote about religion more than natural science
 He believed in the rational world, but rejected the hylozoism inherent in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza
 Thus, ordered and dynamically informed cosmologies Was understandable and should be understood by an active cause
 In his correspondence, Newton claimed that Prine Time "writes Sipia i had an eye upon such principles, in order to be considered faith in God and man
" He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: such wonderful uniformity in the planetary system should be allowed the effect of choice
 " But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be necessary to improve the system due to the slow growth of instabilities
 Leibniz for ne un par ninda lekh kiya: "sarvashaktimaan ishwar samay samay par apni ghadi ko samaapt karnaa chahta he: anyathaa yah sthanantarit karne ke liye band kar diya jaayegaa

 The attacks against pre-enlightenment "magical thinking," and the mystical elements of Christianity, found their foundation in Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe
 Newton perfected Boyle's ideas through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, he was very successful in popularizing them
 Newton transformed an interventionist God-controlled world into a world artistically created by God with rational and universal principles
 ye siddhant sabhi logon ke liye khojane hetu uplabdh hai, ye logon ko isi jivan main apane uddeshyon ko faldaayi rup se puraa karne kii anumati dete hai, agle jivan kaa intjaar nahin karte hai or unhen unki apni tarksangat shaktiyon se purna banaate hai

 As the manager of the royal mint, Newton estimated that 20% of the re-minted coins were forged
 jaalsaji ek bahut bada rajdroh tha, jiske liye faansee kii sajaa thi
 Despite this, it was very difficult to catch the most fiery criminals; However, Newton proved to be correct for this task
 By going disguised in the tavern and in jail, he gathered a lot of evidence himself

 He petitioned the Parliament to accept his plan for the minting of coins so that counterfeiting could not be committed, while at the same time forged coins appeared
 newton ne chalonor par jaalsaji kaa pareekshan kiya or sitambar 1697 main use new get jail main bhej diya
 But Chaloner had friends in high places, who helped him with his release
 newton ne duusari baar nirnaayak saboot ke saath us par parikshan kiya
 Chaloner was found guilty of high treason and was hanged and buried on 23 March 1699 at Tiburon Gallows

 According to Newton's second law, the force exerted on an object is f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec {, its momentum over time p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec { Is equal to the rate of change in
 ganitiya rup main ise nimnanusaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he Since the second law applies to an object of constant mass, the first term vanishes and by substitution using the definition of acceleration, the equation can be written as follows
 pehla or doosraa niyam arastu kii bhautikee ko todane kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jisamen aisa mana jaataa tha ki gati ko banaaye rakhane ke liye ek bal jaruri he
 They are a motive of the pace of the system in the state to change the state that only one power is needed
 newton ke sammaan main bal kii SI ikai kaa naam newton rakhaa gaya he
 According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction
 iskaa arth yah he ki jab bhi ek vastu kisi duusari vastu par ek bal lagaati he tab duusari vastu vipareet disha main pehali vastu par utana hi bal lagati he
 a common example of this is two ice skates move opposite to each other and then slide in opposite directions
 ek anya udhaaharan he bandook kaa peeche kii or dhakka mahasoos karnaa, jisamen bandook ke dwaara goli ko daagne ke liye us par lagaaya gaya bal, ek baraabar or vipareet bal bandook par lagaataa he jise goli chalaane vaala mahasoos karata he
 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different
 arestu ke vipareet, newton kii bhautikee saarvatrik ho gayi he
 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone
 duusare niyam kii sadish prakruti bal kii disha or vastu ke samveg main parivartan ke prakaar ke bich ek jyamitiya sambandh sthapit karti he
 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move
 newton ne darshaya ki is ke bajaay surya kaa andar kii or ek aakarshan bal aavashyak hota he
 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted
 or kai vaigyanikon ne descartes ke vortices ke siddhant ko variyata di
 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth
 " isi prakaar ke shabdon main, volter mahakavy kavita par niabandh main likhaa, "sar ijac newton kaa apane baganon main gum rahe the, ped se girte hue ek seb ko dekh kar, unhone gurutvkarshan kii pranali ke bare main pehali baar sochaa
 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked
 mul vriksh kaa vanshaj trinity college, cambridge ke mukhya dwaar ke baahar uga hua dekha ja saktaa he, yah us kamare ke neeche he jisamen newton padhai ke samay rahata tha

 kyonki bhartiya pranali kii sthaneey maan kii avadharana inamen nahin he, isliye roman ankon main ganit karnaa bahut hi mushkil he
 As Indian numerals first spread to the Middle East and then Europe, Roman numerals began to be used only for class-chapter names, and their role in mathematics ended

 Due to no evidence found against Veer Savarkar, the court acquitted him of the crime
 baad main saavarkar ke nidhan par bharat sarkaar ne unke sammaan main ek dak tikat jari kiya
 And in the end, three of the five accused - Gopal Godse, Madanlal Pahwa and Vishnu Ramakrishna Karkare - were sentenced to life imprisonment and two - Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were hanged

 He folded his hands and said - "hello Bapu!" Manu walking with Gandhi said - "brother! Get out of front, let Bapu go
" baapu ko pehle hi der ho chuki he
 "but Godse smacked Manu and fired three bullets one after the other at Gandhi's chest with a small barreta pistol hidden in his hands

 78-year-old Mahatma Gandhi was killed
 birla house main gandhi ke sharir ko dhankkar rakhaa gaya tha
 But when his youngest son Devdas Gandhi arrived there, he removed the cloth from Bapu's body so that the world could see the violence with the priest of peace and non-violence

 The bomb exploded on the front wall and broke the wall
 gandhi ne kabhi nahin sochaa hoga ki koi unhen jaan se maarna chahta he
 Gandhi started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi in which he was asked to immediately end communal violence and pay Rs 50 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jaayegaa tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaayegi
 Seeing the insistence of Gandhi, the government paid this amount but Hindu organizations felt that Gandhiji was doing tricks to make Muslims happy

 Gandhi was very sad to hear such news coming out and he wanted to answer it
 vah to yahan tak chaahate the ki ve swayan sardaar patel ko istipha dene ko kah den taaki nehru hi sarkaar kaa puraa kaamkaaj dekhen
 But this could not happen
 unhone 30 janvari 1948 ko patel ko baatcheet ke liye chaar baje shaam ko bulaayaa or prarthana khatm hone ke baad is masale par baatcheet karne ko kaha
 But destiny did not approve of it

 gandhi kaha karte the ki unki jindagi ishwar ke haath main he or yadi unhen maranaa hua to koi bachaa nahin saktaa he
 He once said- "those who want security instead of freedom have no right to live
" " haalanki birla bhawan ke get par ek paharedaar jarur rahata tha
 The then Home Minister Sardar Patel ordered the deployment of a head constable and four constables at Birla House as a precautionary measure
 gandhi kii prarthana ke vakt birla bhawan main sade kapadon main police tainaat rahati thi jo har sandigdh vyakti par najar rakhti thi
 However, the police thought that as a precaution, it would be better if the people who come to attend the prayer meeting are searched and allowed to enter the premises of Birla Bhavan
 lekin gandhi ji ko police kaa yah idia pasand nahin aayaa
 An officer of the DIG level of police also talked to Gandhi about this and said that his life may be in danger but Gandhi did not agree
 baapu kii hatya ke baad nandalaal mehta dwaara darz exiaar ke mutabiq unke mukh se niklaa antim shabd 'he ram' tha
 But V
 Kalyanam, who worked as a freedom fighter and private secretary of Gandhi, claims that this is not true
 us ghatana ke vaqt gandhi ke thik peeche khadey kalyanm ne kaha ki goli lagane ke baad gandhi ke munh se ek bhi shabd nikalne kaa sawaal hi nahin tha
 Although Gandhi often used to say that when he dies, the name of Ram will be on his lips
 yadi vah biimaar hote yaa bistar par pade hote to unke munh se jarur 'ram' nikalataa
 The commission set up to investigate the assassination of Gandhi did not even bother to interrogate the people closest to the father on that day
 phir bhi yah duniya bhar main mashhoor ho gaya ki gandhi ke munh se nikle aakhri shabd 'he ram' the
 But it could never be proved
 is baat kii bhi koi jaankaree nahin milti ki goli lagane ke baavjood unhen aspataal le jane ke bajaay birla house main hi waapas kyon le jaaya gaya? It is also believed that a family friend of Mahatma Gandhi kept his ashes in a secret place for about 62 years which was flown into the sea of durban on 30 January 2010

 " Einstein has written about Bapu that the achievements of Mahatma Gandhi are amazing in political history
 unhone desh ko daastaa se mukt karaane ke liye sangharsh kaa aisa nayaa maarg chunaa jo maanviya or anokhaa he
 It is a path that forces the civilized society of the whole world to think about humanity
 unhone likhaa ki hamen is baat par prasann hona chaiye ki takadir ne hamen apane samay main ek aisa vyakti tohfe main diya jo aane vaali pidiyon ke liye path pradarshak banegaa
 The Congress does not get tired of calling Gandhi as its ideal, whereas the people of the same party used to disrespect Gandhi

 " - Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi 28 January 1948 apane sampoorn jeevankaal main mahatma gandhi ne kareeb 35 hajaar patr likhe
 In these letters, Bapu used to address his colleagues, disciples, friends, relatives etc
 under his pseudonym

 mujhe is baat kii santushti mili ki jo kaam main kar rahaa hoon vah aapaki drushti main sahi he
 i hope to meet you face to face in my ashram in India
 " Was it not the responsibility of Jawaharlal Nehru who was the Prime Minister of the country, or Sardar Patel, who was the Home Minister?

 Ho is clinging to the scriptures, be daunted, be a prince, by declaring Rana as a mourner; There should be flying tigmish sun-sun

le chalo, jahaan fat rahaa vyom, much rahaa jahaan par ghamaasan, saakaar dhwans ke bich paith chhodana mujhe he aaj praan

 Big Radhey! It is a wonderful thing
 It is the ambush of some misery
 It is trapped in black mud, but the chariot cycle is something like this; nikaale se nikalataa hi nahin he, hamaara jor chalata hi nahin he, jaraa tum bhi ise jhakzor dekho, laga apni bhujaa kaa jor dekho 
 Laughing radically, remembering something in my mind, said, Yes, the truth is, in all Bhuvan, the unique thing is for me, the ambition of destiny is for me
 magar, he thik, kismat hi fanse jab, dharaa hi karn kaa syandan grase jab, sivaa radhey ke paurush prabal se, nikaale koun usko baahubal se ? Bouncing off Karna descending from the sand, filling the chariot chakra in the middle of the arm, felt it to lift up, sometimes straight, sometimes by shaking
 mahi doli, salil-aagaar dola, bhujaa ke jor se sansar dolan dola, kintu, jo chakkaa fansaa tha, chalaa vah ja rahaa neeche dhansa tha
 In the calamity, after finding Karna suffering like this, finding him dead, chaotic, awake, God is awakened to Parth

 hindu dharm ke anusaar, khatu shyaam ji kaliyug main krishna ke avatar hai, jinhone shri krishna se vardaan praapt kiya tha ki ve kalyug main unke naam shyaam se puuje jaayenge
 Shri Krishna was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Barbareek and gave a boon that as Kali Yuga descends, you will be worshiped in the name of Shyam
 tumhaare bhakton kaa keval tumhaare naam kaa sachche dil se uccharan maatr se hi uddhaar hoga
 If they worship you with their true mind and love, then all their desires will be fulfilled and all their work will be successful

 They were formerly known as Barbaric

 He was a very brave and great warrior since childhood
 unhone yuddh kala apni maan tathaa shri krishna se sikhi
 Pleased Lord Shiva by doing severe penance and obtained three unbroken arrows; In this way, he got the famous name of three gunadhis
 agnidev prasann hokar unhen dhanush pradaan kiya, jo unhen teenon lokon main vijayi banane main samarth the
 The war of Mahabharata had become unavoidable between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, when they received the news of Barbaric, their desire to join the war was also aroused
 jab ve apni maan se aashirwad praapt karne pahunche tab maan ko haare hue paksh kaa saath dene kaa vachan diya
 He rode on his blue horse with three arrows and a bow to the battlefield of Kurukshetra
 sarvyaapee shri krishna ne brahman bhesh dhaaran kar barbaric ke bare main jaanane ke liye unhen roka or yah jaanakar unki hansee udaayi ki vah maatr teen baan se yuddh main sammilit hone aayaa he; aisa sunakar barbaric ne uttar diya ki maatr ek baan shatru sena ko parrast karne ke liye paryaapt he or aisa karne ke baad baan waapas tunir main hi aayega
 If the three arrows are used, then the entire universe will be destroyed
 yah jaanakar bhagavan krishna ne unhen chunauti di kii is vriksh ke sabhi patton ko vedhakar dikhalaao
 They were both standing under the Peepal tree
 barbaric ne chunauti sweekaar kii or apane tunir se ek baan nikaala or ishwar ko samaran kar baan ped ke patton kii ore chalaaya
 The arrow momentarily pierced all the leaves of the tree and began to circle around the feet of Shri Krishna, as he hid a leaf under his foot; Barbaric said that you remove your leg, otherwise this arrow will pierce your leg as well
 tatpashchaat, shri krishna ne balak barbaric se poocha ki vah yuddh main kis ore se sammilit hoga; barbaric ne apni maan ko diye vachan ko doharaaya or kaha yuddh main jo paksh nirbal or haar rahaa hoga usee ko apana saath degaa
 Kष्णवोंवोंa knew that the Kauravas were sure to lose in the war, and because of this, if Barbarik supported them, the result would go to the wrong side
 at: brahmanroopi shri krishna ne vir barbaric se daan kii abhilaashaa vyakt kii
 Barbaric pledged them and asked for donations
 brahman ne unase sheesh kaa daan maanga
 Veer Barbarik was astonished for a moment, but could not stand by his word
 vir barbaric bole ek saadhaaran brahman is tarah kaa daan nahin maang saktaa he, at: brahman se apane vaastivak rup se avgat karaane kii prarthana kii
 Shri Krishna came into his real form as a Brahmin
 shri krishna ne barbaric ko sheesh daan maangane kaa kaaran samajhaayaa ki yuddh armbh hone se purv yubhumi pujan ke liye teenon lokon main sarvshereshth kshatriya ke sheesh kii aahuti deni hoti he; isliye aisa karne ke liye ve vivash the
 Barbaric prayed to them that they wanted to see war to the end
 shri krishna ne unki yah prarthana sweekaar kar lee
 Pleased with this sacrifice, Shri Krishna decorated Barbarik with the title of Best Hero in War
 unke sheesh ko yubhumi ke sameep hi ek pahari par sushobhit kiya gaya; jahaan se barbaric sampoorn yuddh kaa jayja le sakate the
 On the Dwadashi of the month of Falgun, he donated his head, thus he was called the donor of the head
 mahabharat yuddh kii samaapti par pandavon main hi aapasi vivaad hone laga ki yuddh main vijay kaa shrey kisko jaataa he? shri krishna ne unase kaha barbaric kaa sheesh sampoorn yuddh kaa sakshi he, atev usase behatar nirnaayak bhala koun ho saktaa he? sabhi is baat se sahamat ho gayi or pahari kii ore chal pade, vahaan pahunchakar barbaric ke sheesh ne uttar diya ki shri krishna hi yuddh main vijay praapt karaane main sabase mahaan paatr hai, unki shiksha, upasthiti, yudhniti hi nirnaayak thi
 He was seen only walking in the battlefield with his Sudarshan Chakra which was cutting the enemy army
 mahakali, krishna ke aadesh par shatru sena ke rakt se bhare pyaalon kaa seven kar rahi thim
 Shri Krishna Veer was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Barbareek and gave a boon that in Kali Yuga you will be known by the name Shyam, because in that age, the one who supports the loser is able to bear the name Shyam
 unka sheesh khatu nagar main dafanaaya gaya isliye unhen khatu shyaam baba kaha jaataa he
 a cow came to that place and was automatically pouring milk from her breasts
 baad main khudaai ke baad vah sheesh prakat hua, jise kuch dinon ke liye ek brahman ko soopurd kar diya gaya
 Once the king of Khatu city was inspired to build the temple in a dream and to beautify it in the head temple
 tadantar us sthaan par mandir kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or karthik maah kii ekadshi ko sheesh mandir main sushobhit kiya gaya, jise baba shyaam ke janmdin ke rup main manaaya jaataa he

 Khatushyam is the family deity of a large number of families
 shri khatu shyaam ji kaa balykaal main naam barbaric tha
 His mother, Gurujan and relatives knew him by this name
 shyaam naam unhen krishna ne diya tha
 He got this name because of his curly hair
 inaki kahani madhya kaaleen mahabharat se shuru hoti he 
 Khatushyam ji was earlier known as Barbarik
 He was the son of Ghatotkach, son of the super-powerful Bhima and son of Nag Kanya Hidimbi
 khatu shyaam ji bal avasthaa se bahut balashaali or vir the unhone yuddh kala apni mata hidimbi tathaa bhagavan krishna se sikhi 
 He worshiped Lord Shiva and received three unique arrows from Lord Shiva
 is tarah unhen teen baan dhari ke naam se janaa jane laga 
 Agni Dev was pleased and provided him with a bow that could give him victory in all three locos
 When the war of Mahabharata was going on between Korvo and Pandavo, when Barbarik came to know about this, he also wished to do battle
 ve apni mata ke paas gaye or bole mujhe bhi mahabharat kaa yuddh karnaa he to unki mata boli putr tum kiski taraf se yuddh karoge 
 Then he said he would fight on behalf of the loser
 jab vah yuddh karne ja rahe the unhen raste main unhen ek shri krishna mili 
 He asked where are you going
 tab barbaric ne sari baat bataai 
 Shri Krishna ji said in Kalyug, people will come to know you as Shyam
 Because you are with the loser
 Kuki Barbarik's head was buried in Khatu city, so he is called Khatushyam rishi vedavyas dwaara rachit skanda puraana ke anusaar mahabali bhim evam hidimba ke putr vir ghatotkach ke shastrarth kii pratiyogita jeetne par inkaa vivaah pragajyotishpur ke raja daityaraj moore kii putree kamkatankakata se hua
 Kamakatankakata is also known by the name "morvi"

 These are the same heroic barbaric who are known today by Shri Shyam of Khatu, Avatar of Kaliyug, Shyam Sarkar, Three Bandhari, Sheesh Ka Dani, Khatu Naresh and countless other names
 barbaric ke janm ke pashchaat mahabali ghatotkach inhen bhagavan shri krishna ke paas dwarka le gayi or unhen dekhte hi shri krishna ne vir barbaric se kaha— he putr morvey! jis prakaar mujhe ghatotkach pyaara he, usee prakaar tum bhi mujhe pyaare ho
 After that Veer Barbarik asked Shri Krishna - Lord! What is the best use of this life? On hearing this innocent question of Veer Barbarik, Shri Krishna said - o son, the best use of this life is to always support religion by being a companion of benevolence and the weak
 jiske liye tumhen bal evam shaktiyaan arjeet kerani padegi
 Therefore, you worship Navdurga in the Mahisagar region and earn powers
 shri krishna ke kehane par balak barbaric ne bhagavan ko pranaam kiya
 Seeing his simple heart, Shri Krishna decorated Veer Barbarik with the name "suhridaya"
 tatpashchaat barbaric ne samast astr-shastr, vidya hasil kar, mahisagar kshetra main 3 varsh tak navadurga kii aradhana kii, sachhee nishtha evam tap se prasann hokar bhagwati jagadamba ne vir barbaric ke sammukh prakat hokar teen baan evam kai shaktiyaan pradaan kin, jisase teenon lokon par vijay praapt kii ja sakati thi
 Here he got the name "chandil"
 maan jagadamba ne vir barbaric ko usee kshetra main apane param bhakt vijay naamak ek brahman kii siddhi ko sampoorn karwaane kaa nirdesh dekar antardhyaan ho gayin
 When Vijay Brahmin arrived, Veer Barbarik completed the yagna of Pingal, Replender, Duhadruha and nine types of carnivorous Palasi demons by consuming them like fire
 us brahman kaa yajna sampoorn karwaane par devi-devtaa vir barbaric se ati prasann hue or prakat hokar yajna kii bhasmarupi shaktiyaan pradaan kin
 Once upon a time, Barbareek turned down the offer of snake girls on the road between Earth and Hades, saying that he had pledged to be a lifelong celibate
 mahabharat yuddh prarambh hone par vir barbaric ne apni mata morvi ke sammukh yuddh main bhaag lene kii ichha prakat kii
 Then mother ordered them to participate in the war with the promise that you will play the side of the loser in the war
 jab vir barbaric yuddh main bhaag lene chale tab bhagwaan shri krishna ne mahabharat yuddh ke pehle hi inako purv janm ke brahma ji dwaara praapt alp shraap ke kaaran evam yah sochakar ki yadi vir barbaric yuddh main bhaag lenge to kauravon kii samaapti keval 18 dinon main mahabharat yuddh main nahin ho sakati or pandavon kii haar nishchit ho jaaegi
 Thinking this, Shri Krishna decapitated the heroic Barbaric and denied the Mahabharata war
 unke aisa karte hi ranbhumi main shok kii lahar daud gayi, tatkshan ranbhumi main 14 deviyaan prakat ho gayin
 The goddesses disclosed the curse received by Brahma ji before the present birth of Veer Barbarik to all the warriors present as follows- deviyon ne kaha: "dwaparayug ke armbh hone se purv moore daitya ke atyaacharon se vyathit hokar prithvi apane gauswarup main dev sabha main upasthit hokar boleen— “he devgan! main sabhi prakaar kaa santaap sahan karne main sakasham hoon
 Bearing the burden of mountains, rivers, streams and all mankind, i continue to tolerate my daily activities with great pleasure, but i am deeply saddened by the atrocities of the Moore monster
 aaplog is duraachaari se meri raksha kiijie, main aapke sharan main aayi hoon
 " gauswarupa dharaa kii karun pukaar sunakar sari devsabha main ekadam sannata-sa chaa gaya
 After a while of silence, Brahma Ji said- "now the only way to get rid of it is that all of us should walk in the shelter of Lord Vishnu and pray to him to get rid of this crisis of the earth
 ” Then Yaksharaj Suryavarcha, who was seated in the assembly, said in his powerful speech - "O Gods, the Moor monster is not so glorious, which only Vishnu can destroy
 har ek baat ke liye hamen unhen ksht nahin dena chahie
 If you give me permission, then only i can kill him
 ” On hearing this, Brahma Ji said- “silly! i know your might, your ego has challenged this deity
 iskaa dand tumhen avashya milegaa
 Ignorant considering myself superior to Vishnu! You will fall from this deity to the earth now
 tumhaara janm rakshas yoni main hoga or jab dwaparayug ke antim charan main prithvi par ek bheeshan dharmayuddh hoga tabhi tumhaara shirochhedan swayan bhagwaan vishnu dwaara hoga or tum sadaa ke liye rakshas bane rahoge
 " brahmaji ke is abhishaap ke saath hi yaksharaj suryavarcha kaa mithyaa garv bhi chur-chur ho gaya
 He immediately fell at the feet of Brahma ji and said in a polite manner - “god! Forgive me for these words which came out by mistake, i am your refuge
 trahimam! trahimam! raksha kiijie prabhu!” Hearing this, Karuna sentiment in Brahma, he said - “watts! You have proudly insulted the Devas, so i cannot take this curse back
 haan, isamen sansodhan avashya kar saktaa hoon ki swayan bhagavan shri krishna tumhaara shirochhedan apane sudarshan chakra se karenge, deviyon dwaara tumhaare sheesh kaa abhisinchan hoga
 As a result, you will receive the boon of being worshiped like the gods in the Kali-yuga from the Lord Krishna
 ” After this, Lord Shri Hari also said to Yaksharaj Suryavarcha in this way- tatsatatheti tan praah keshwa devsansadi ! shiriste pujayishyanti devyah pujyo bhavishyasi !! Bhaartarth: "at that time in the assembly of the gods, Shri Hari said - o heroic! Okay, your head will be worshiped and you will be worshiped in the form and you will get fame
" " Devi Chandika again told all the people present there, "after seeing his curse culminating in the boon, Yaksharaj Suryavarcha became invisible from that deity, and in the course of time, in this earth, Ghatotkacha, son of Mahabali Bhima and barbaric form of Morvi
 Took birth in isliye aap sabhi ko is baat par koi shok nahin karnaa chahie or isamen shri krishna kaa koi dosha nahin he
 " ityukte chandika devi tada bhakt shiristivdam ! abhyukshya sudhaya sheeghra majran chaamran vyaadhaat !! Such as Rahu Shirshadwad Tachhira: Pranamam Tana! Bhaartarth: "after saying this, Chandika Devi quickly displayed the devotee's head with nectar and made it immortal and immortal like the head of Rahu and this newly awakened head bowed to them all and said-" i want to see war , You approve it

 " Barbaric headdress Girishrungambap Tatt! The world is not a cult of peace Tato war mahdbhut kuru pandava senyo: !! Bhaartarth: "veer Barbarik's sheesh reached the top of the mountain and his torso was cremated with classical method but the sheesh was not done after that there was a fierce battle between the Kaurava and Pandava forces
 " Yogeshwar Lord Shri Krishna made the head of Veer Barbarik irrigated with nectar by 14 goddesses who appeared in the battlefield and made that head immortal by granting it divinity, and Lord Krishna worshiped the head of Veer Barbarik in the form of God in Kali Yuga
 Blessed to fulfill the wishes of the devotees
 vir barbaric ne bhagavan shri krishna ke samaksh mahabharat ke yuddh dekhne kii apni prabal ichha ko bataaya, jise shri krishna ne vir barbaric ke devatv praapt sheesh ko unche parvat par rakhkar purna kii evam unke dhad kaa antim sanskaar shastrokt vidhi se sampoorn karavaaya


 At the end of the Mahabharata war, a mutual debate broke out among the Pandavas as to who goes to the credit of victory in the war
 shri krishna ne kaha barbaric ke sheesh se poocha jaae ki usne is yuddh main kiskaa parakram dekha he
 Then Sheesh of Veer Barbarik replied that this war has been won only because of Lord Shri Krishna's policy and in this war only Lord Krishna's Sudarshan Chakra was going on
 vir barbaric ke dwaara aisa kehete hi samast nabhmandal udbhashit ho uthaa evam us dev swarup sheesh par pushp kii varsha hone lagi or devataaon ne shankhanaad kiya
 After that, Lord Shri Krishna again bowed down the head of Veer Barbarik and said, "O Veer Barbarik, you will be worshiped everywhere in Kali Yuga and complete the desired work of all your devotees
 atev, aapako is kshetra kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie, hamalogon se jo aparaadh ho gayi hai, unhen krupa kar kshamaa kiijie
 " itnaa sunate hi pandav sena main harsh kii lahar daud gayi
 The soldiers re-irrigated the head with the water of holy shrines and hoisted their victory flag near the shisha
 is din sabhi ne mahabharat kaa vijay-parv dhoomdhaam se manaaya
 The character of Veevar Morveenandan Sri Barbarik is elaborated in the "second Subdivision 'qomarik Khand' under Maheshwar Khand" of Skanda Purana
