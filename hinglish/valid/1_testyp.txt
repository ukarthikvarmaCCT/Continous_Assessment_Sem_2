 There is a wide spread where the relation between for and the purpose is proved to be prohibitive

 The term 'topology' implies two things: sansthitivigyaan ek vistrut kshetra vaala vishay he
 It has several subfields
 iske kuch pramukh kshetra nimnaankit hai: Arithmetic Information theory · probability · statistics · optimization · control theory · game theory shuddh ganit · anuprayukt ganit · vivikt ganit · abhiklanaatmak ganit The periodic table is a system of representing chemical elements as a table with their corresponding characteristics
 aavart sarini main rasinic tatva parmaanu kramank ke badhate kram main sajaaye gayi hai tathaa aavart, praathmik samooh, dwitiyak samooh main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 The current periodic table contains 118 known elements
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 a few months later, German scientist Lothar Meyer also independently created the periodic table
 mendeleyev kii sarini se alfred varnor ne aavart sarini kaa vartmaan swaroop nirmit kiya
 In 1952, Costa Rica scientist Gil Chaveri introduced a new form of the periodic table that was based on the electronic structure of elements
 rasayan shastriyon ke liye aavart sarini atyant mahatvapurn evam upyogi he
 Because of this, memorizing only the properties of lesser elements works because the properties in a group or a period in the periodic table change in a certain order and in a rational way
 neeche aavart sarini kaa aadhunik rup dikhaaya gaya he jisamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai- Lanthanide and actinide have been kept separate from other metals in this prevailing arrangement of the periodic table
 vistrut or ati-vistrut aavart saranion main f-block or g-block dhaatuon ko bhi ek saath prabandhit kiya jaataa he
 Categories of elements in the periodic table tatwon ke parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhi kram main krambaddh karne par kshaitij kataren praapt hoti hai jinhen 'aavart' kehete hai
 According to the periodic law, when the elements are decorated in horizontal lines in increasing order of atomic weight, the elements having salmon properties are present in the same vertical column, these are called 'squares'
 aavart sarini ke urdhv kataron ko 'samooh' yaa 'varg' kaha jaataa he
 Groups are considered to be the most important in terms of classification of elements
 kuch samoohon main, tatv samaan gun darshaate hai
 The names of these groups are alkaline elements, alkaline earth metals, halogen, nictogen, chalcogen and inert gas
 aavart sarini ke kshaitij kataron ko aavart kehete hai
 Although groups are considered to be more important in the classification of elements, then there are many sites in the periodic table where the importance of periodic is greater
 udhaaharan ke rup main di-block yaa sankraman dhaatuon or epa-block ko liya ja saktaa he
 Modern periodic table is also called long form of periodic table
 isamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai
 Atoms of all elements of a single class have the same number of electrons in the outermost orbit
 is kaaran kisi ek varg ke sabhi tatwon ke mukhya gun samaan hote hai
 On the basis of valence electrons, the elements are divided into 4 sections - s, p, d, f
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 according to this, arthath yadi tatwon ko parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhikram main rakhaa jaay to wo tatv jinke gun samaan hote hai ek nishchit avadhi ke baad aate hai
 Mendeleev tried to demonstrate the aspect of recurring physical and chemical properties of elements with the help of this table
 mandelif kii aavart sarini main kul 8 varg the kyonki us samay niskriy gaison kii khoj nahin hui thi
 Later the 9th class was included in the modern periodic table after the discovery of inert gases
 is 9wein varg ko 0 kehete hai
 Classes one through eighth are represented by the Roman letters I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII
 nawein varg ko 0 dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In the last phase of its development, scientists like Raga, Werner, Bohr and Bari created the modern form of the periodic table which is in practice till the present
 inhone mendelive kii aavart sarini main upasthit shreniyon ko khatm kiya tathaa virgo kii sankhya ko 9 se badhaakar 18 kiya
 Even after this, the two main drawbacks so far are the presence of hydrogen in two places and the absence of lanthanide and actinide elements in the table
 madlif dwaara aavart sarini prastut karne ke kuch maheenon baad german vaigyanik lother meyar ne bhi swatantra rup se aavart sarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 From 1815 to 1913, it underwent a lot of reforms so that the newly invented elements could be given proper place and the table should be in accordance with the new information
 mendeleyev kii sarini se alfred varnor ne aavart sarini kaa vartmaan swaroop nirmit kiya
 In 1952, Costa Rica scientist Gil Chaveri introduced a new form of the periodic table that was based on the electronic structure of elements

 The song of chants with ascension and descent is called Sama
 sam se sambaddh veda samaveda kehalaata he
 In fact, the Samaveda is a compilation of the Rigveda's verses which were considered worthy of singing
 richaon kaa gaan hi samaveda kaa mukhya uddeshy mana jaataa he
 The Samaveda is mainly concerned with worship, in Somayag, it receives the praise of the deities of the invocation
 yajna-sampaadan kaal main udgaata in mantron kaa gaan karata tha
 Somaras, Somdevata, Somayag, Sompan have significance in the entire Samaveda, hence it is also called Sompradhan Veda
 samgaan kii pruthak paramparaon ke kaaran samaveda kii ek sahasr shakhaon kaa ullekh mahabhashya main praapt hota he -'sahastravartma samaveda:
 'three branches of the Sampradaya Samaveda are available - Kauthumiya, Ranayani, Jamayani
 ye teenon shakhayein kramash: gujarat, maharashtra, karnataka evam kerala main mukhya rup se prachlit he
 a brief introduction to these codes is as follows - is samhita ke purvarchik evam uttararchik ye do khand hai
 The precursor is also called verses
 is purvarchik ke aagney, endra, pavamaan, aaranyak ye chaar bhaag hai
 They are also called festivals
 purvarchik main 6 prapathak hai tathaa uttararchik main 9 prapathak hai
 In this Samhita, mainly the hymns related to Agni Som, the mantra related to Indra's recitation mantra, Dasratra, Samvatsara, Ekah Yajna
 isaki vishaywastu evam mantron kaa kram kauthumiya samhita ke samaan hi he
 The only difference is in the method of singing
 isamen vishaywastu kaa vibhaajan prapathak, ardhprapathak evam dashati ke rup main he
 The syllabic distinction of this code is also obtained from the Kauthum branch
 jaimineey samhita evam kauthum samhita main samgaanon kii sankhya kaa bhed he
 The Kauthum branch has over 1000 ingredients in the Jamina Code
 talavkaar isaki avaantar shakha he jisase sambaddh upanishad kenopanishad ke naam se prasiddh he
 Adequate Sahitya has been composed on the anthem of Samaveda
 in grathon kaa aadhaar purvarchik mantra hai
 These items are of 4 types - vaidic samhitaon main samaveda samhita kaa atyant mahatv he
 Lord Sri Krishna calls himself Samaveda - 'vedanam Samaveedosmi
 ' brihaddevataa main samaveda ke darshanik evam tattvik mahatva ko spasht karte huye kaha gaya he ki - 'yo vetti saamani sa vetti tatvam
 ' bhartiya sangeet bhi dekhen
 The Samagan has its own distinctive vocal
 logon main ek bhrant dharna he ki bhartiya sangeet main swarlipi nahin thi or yah europea sangeet kaa paridaan he
 All the Vedas have specific notes of sublime, anudatta and swarth for the recitation, but the rishis had prepared a complete lyric for the Samaveda's anthem
 sansar bhar main yah sabase puraani swarlipi taiyaar kar lee thi
 It is an old vowel in all of the world
 sumer ke gaan kii bhi kuch swarlipi yatratatra khudi hui milti he
 But he does not get any literature
 at: uske vishay main vishisht rup se kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 But all the mantras of the Sama are written in the form of the script, so they can be sung in the same form even today
 aajkal jitne bhi samgaan ke prakashit granth milte hai unki swarlipi sankhyatmak he
 The first number within 1 to 5 written on the first letter of a material is indicative of the starting tone of that group
 6 or 7 kii sankhya aarambh main kabhi nahin di hoti
 Therefore their vowels are not the starting vowels
 ham yah dekh chuke hai ki saamagram avarohi kram kaa tha
 Therefore, the indicative numbers of its vowels should be taken in descending order
 praaia: 1 se 5 ke arthath madhyam se nishad ke bheetar kaa koi na koi aarambhk swar arthath shadj swar hota he
 The letter "R" near the number indicates elongation
 udaahranarth nimnlikhit "aajyadoham" sam ke swar is prakaar honge : Re, s, ni, dh, p - these five vowels are engaged in this material
 sankhya ke anusaar bhinn bhinn saamon ke aarambhk swar badal jate hai
 The changing of the initial vowels creates different idols, which are the mother of caste and raga
 samaveda ke kavy main swar, gram or moorchana kaa vikaas ho chukaa tha
 There was no rhythm in the Samaveda, but there was rhythm
 swar, gram, lay or moorchana saare sangeet ke aadhaar hai
 Therefore, Samaveda is considered the basis of music
 praatishakhya or shikha kaal main swaron ke naam shadj, rishabh, gandhar, madhyam, pancham, dhaivat or nishad ho gaye
 The order of the village became adorable: the three places of vowel were fixed to the mandra, the middle and the best
 rikpratishakhya main uparyukt teenon sthanon or saaton swaron ke naam milte hai
 Road is a road built on such land which has been made easy to transport through a vehicle by leveling it or developing it otherwise
 aadhunik gadiyon ke chalaane ke liye sadakon par aksar toote pattharon kii parat ke upar tarkol failaayaa hua hota he
 On developed roads, vehicles going in opposite directions are also divided into separate lanes
 paidal chal rahe vyaktiyon kii suvidha ke liye aksar sadakon ke saath-saath futapaath bhi banaae jate hai
 Roads in the Indian subcontinent have been built since around 3000 BC
 yatriyon or maal asabaab ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak nunatam chalanshkti lagaakar pahunchaane ke liye sadakon kaa nirmaan is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki banane main vyay bhi kam ho or peeche dekhbhaal bhi bahut mahangi na ho
 In the early stages of road development in all countries, when vehicles used to drive slowly, the structural aspect of the paved middle of the road was given more attention than its geometric form
 motor gadiyon kii sankhya or unki gati main vruddhi hone par, sadak ke dizine main uske jyamithik rup kaa mahatv bahut bad gaya he
 This is also appropriate, as the design of concrete shells can be improved later as per the requirement of traffic, but the geometrical form of the road changes due to local conditions, according to the safety and comfort of the passenger as the motors increase
 Becomes difficult, although not prohibited in terms of expenditure sadak nirmaan main kaary ke kai charan hai : The field survey also has three parts: the first 'reconnaissance' survey, which looks at the natural features of the area and other local conditions in order to see which alternative routes are possible and what will be their loss benefits; The second preliminary survey, which looks at the natural features affecting potential routes in detail, and the third 'final drawing survey', in which the selected line is marked on the ground and a 'bottom' survey is carried out as needed
 mitti surveykshan main us maarg par milanevaali, nirmaan main kaam main aane yogya mitti or anya padaarthon kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 Traffic survey is done to get an idea of the type, number, weight of trains etc
 on the route
 nirmaan ke jyamithik paksh hai : maarg kii rekha, sadak kii chaudaai, mode, kshaitij evam urdhwadhar bahari uthaan, duusare bhaagon ke saath sangam tathaa drushti duuri aadi
 Their design is designed keeping in mind the expected number of traffic, load, velocity and other local conditions
 sanrachaneey dizine pakke gole kaa kiya jaataa he
 The main purpose of a paved shell surface is to provide a firm, paved and smooth passage for traffic and to distribute the load and pucca or impact on the ground rather than below it
 nirmaan main lagaae janevaale padaarthon ke anusaar pakkaa gola drudh yaa lacheela hota he
 a sphere made of cement concrete is an example of a hard shell
 lacheele gole ve hote hai jo mitti, bajri, toote pathar kii rodi, koltar, bitumen yaa anya aise hi padaarthon se banaae jate hai
 Roads in India are built by hand labor, or with instruments
 desh main majdoor bahutayat se milte hai jiske kaaran shaareerik shram kaa hi adhiktar prayog kiya jaataa he, visheshkar jab yojanaayen turant banaai janevaali na hon
 Road milling is done by machine rollers
 pichley dinon main badi sadak yojanaon ko shighrata se nipataane ke liye mashiinon kaa bahut prayog hua he
 Most commonly used machines are: clay scrapers, leveling, bulldozers, cylinders, inverted carts, miners etc
 bitumeni sadak banane ke liye swachal swamaapi or mishrak tathaa bichaai kii mashine aajkal bahut kaam main laai jaati hai
 Testing and control laboratories are very essential for road planning
 ye prayogshalas alp vyay kii dizine main hi sahaayta nahin detii hai, varan kaary ko thik vishishtiyon or vaanchit gunon ke anusaar banane main bhi sahaayta detii he
 Now such laboratories are being used extensively in large road laboratories in India
 samved yaa indriyabodh un shaareerik kshamtaaon ko kehete hai jinase praapt hue gyaan se kisi jeev ko apane vaataavaran kaa bodh hota he
 There are five major sensory organs in humans - seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting
 kintu manushya main inke alaava bhi bahut se samvedon ko grahan karne kii kshamta hoti he, jaise taap aadi
 Other animals have different sense senses, which some fish have senses for water pressure that they can comfortably tell that no other fish is moving around
 kuch anya jaanavar pani main vidyut yaa chumbakeey kshetron main parivartan ko bhaanp lete hai - yaa shikaar karne ke liye bahut laabhakaari hoti he kyonki har anya jeev apane aasapaas vidyut kshetra par prabhaav daalata he
 As soon as the senses acquire knowledge about something in their environment, the object becomes physically "conscious"
 abhi mastishk ne iskaa arth nahin nikaala hota
 There are some such injuries and diseases in the brain in which a person sees things but cannot realize them
 "vizual agnosia" naam ke rog main vyakti cheez dekhakar uskaa vivaran de saktaa he lekin use pahachaanata nahin, jaise ek ghoda dekhakar uski sateek chitra haath se banane main sakasham he lekin yah nahin pahchaan pataa ke yah ek ghoda he
 The reason is that the sense of sensation in these people is perfectly fine, but there have been some problems in the process of learning
 mudgar yaa mungari ek prakaar kaa hathaudaa he jo praayah rabar yaa lakdi kaa bana hota he
 Karwahi is a village in Raigad district under the Chhattisgarh state of India in Gharghoda division

 Limestone is available in many varieties
 yah rang, vinyas, kathorta or tikaaupan main vibhinn gunon kaa hota he
 The thick and dense stone with dense particles are excellent for home building
 ye kaarysadhak, drudh or tikaoo hote hai
