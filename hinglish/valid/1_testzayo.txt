 The same thing can be said in this way that political economics studies intelligent decisions which are taken in the context of political and economic institutions
 is adhyayan main tarksangat aadhaaron kii roshni main samshtigat prabhaavon par gaur kiya jaataa he
 Originally, the study of production and trade, and their method, practice, relation to government and distribution of national income and wealth, was called 'political economics'
 raajnneetik arthshaastra kii utpatti naitik darshan se hui
 It was developed in the eighteenth century for the purpose of studying the economy or polity of the state, hence the name 'political economy'
 attharahavin sadi ke madhya main prakashit adam smith kii rachana velth of neshans se lekar unnisvin sadi main prakashit jon stuart mil kii rachana principles of political iconomi or karl marks kii rachana 'capital : a critic of political iconomi' tak ke lambe daur main arthshaastra kaa anushaasan mukhya taur se 'raajnneetik arthshaastra' ke naam se hi janaa jaataa tha
 Indeed, sociologists were of the opinion that political factors do not necessarily have an impact on economic outcomes but rather have a decisive effect
 beesvin sadi main raajnneetishastra or arthshaastra ke anushaasan alag hote chale gayi
 Under the influence of neoclassical economics, methods of economics evolved to be relatively autonomous from politics, and the emphasis of economists was on the governmental control over consumers and companies, and the conditions of market development
 abhi pichley kuch dashakon se ek baar phir raajnneeti or arthshaastra ke gathjod kii baaten hone lagi hai or naye raajnneetik arthshaastra kii charchaa sunaayi dene lagi he
 The special thing in this new emergence of political economics is that it uses sophisticated analytical methods of modern economics to underline the economic significance of politics
 aarthik vigyaan ke itihaaskaaron ke mutabik political iconomi kaa pad pehali baar 1615 main monkretin da vataville dwaara prayog kiya gaya tha
 This mercantilist scholar of France wanted the definition of economic science to be taken out of the boundaries within which Greek thinkers have limited it
 pracheen unaniyon ke anusaar arthshaastra kaa kshetra ghar-karch tak simit tha
 Monkretin also added to this idea the contemplation ie politics surrounding the institution of the state
 1761 main sar james stuart pehle angrez arthshaastri the jinhone is pad kaa ullekh apni pustak 'ain inquairi intu da principles of political iconomi' ke sheershak main kiya
 Adam Smith's view was that the task of political economics is to make provision for providing sufficient income to the people for living and on the other hand, to provide enough revenue for the government to fulfill its public objectives
 raajnneetik arthshaastra ko smith dwaara di gayi paribhaasha ke daayre se nikaal kar kahin vyapak arth dene kaa kaam karl marks ne kiya
 His contemporary J
S
 Mill was not interested in criticism of capitalism, but he interpreted political economics in terms of value, trade, money, population, salary, economic system, and economic policy
 par marks ne british raajnneetik arthshaastra se grahan kiya ki aarthik vinimay tabhi samtamulak ho saktaa he jab donon pakshon dwaara lagaaya gaya shram-mulya baraabar ho
 But, when one party is the buyer of labor and the other is the seller of labor, then the buyer of labor always makes a lot of profit in any exchange
 isi laabh ke dam par uske paas uttarottar poonji jamaa hoti chali jaati he
 This capital accumulation has profound and far-reaching economic-social consequences and social structures of dominance and subordination are born from its womb
 darasal, marks jis uljhan kaa hal suza rahe the, vah kabhi arestu ne apni nicomacian ithiks main uthaayi thi
 Aristotle's discourse contained the seeds of modern political economics
 arestu kaa kahana tha ki do log jab kinhin do chizon kaa aapas main vinimay karte hai to unamem se ek behatar or ek kamatar hoti hi he
 In such a situation, either side is bound to benefit more than the other
 unka sawaal tha ki donon ke laabhon ko baraabar kaise kiya jaae, kyonki laabhon kii asamta ek visham samaaj ko janm de sakati he
 Aristotle did not have a solution to this problem
 marks kaa yug to rashtron ke vikaas kaa yug tha, isliye unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki poonjeewaad bade paimaane par sampatti jamaa karata chalaa jaataa he or ek mukaam par pahunch kar raashtra ke vikaas main mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Lenin expanded this idea of marx by showing how capitalism expanded its international reach through colonialism and imperialism
 marks or lenin ke vimarsh kaa laabh uthaa kar arthshaastri kai tarah kii radical dharanaon kaa pratipaadan kar paye
 They systematically merged politics and economics, examining the nature of capitalism and the intentions of political parties

 The process of sharing of resources was also explained by different governments

 In the fifties, Richard M
 Titmus divided the philanthropic state on Europe's land into three models
 unhone bataaya ki anglo-sexn desh lok upkaar kii raajnneeti keval tabhi apanaate hai jab bazaar vifal ho jaataa he
 It is a partial kind of public favor
 germany or nederland jaise deshon main lok upkaar kii raajnneeti arthshaastra main audyogic uplabdhiyon ko behatar banane ke liye mishrit kii jaati he
 In Scandivenian countries, the politics of public favor is done in an institutional redistributive model
 haal hi main lokopkaaree rajya kii vyakhya kalyankari poonjeewaad ke rup main bhi kii gayi he
 In The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, Gösta esping-andersen illustrates the capitalist roots of the philanthropic state, showing that these models are of the liberal, conservative and socio-democratic kind
 beesvin sadi ke madhya main hue nio-clasical arthshaastra ne raajnneetik arthshaastra ke vipareet raajnneeti ke prabhaav se swatantra aarthik vigyaan kii vakaalat kii
 In the era of this trend, perhaps Joseph Schumpeter's work Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy was a work that implied that the study of economics is linked to the study of politics
 bazaar kii vifaltaa kii roshni main raajnneetik arthshaastra ne pichley kuch dashakon main apni daavedaari phir se pesh kii he
 a great proof of this was found when three economists gave separate speeches while taking Nobel Prize in December 2007
 teenon ne apane-apane tareekon se raajnneetik sansthaaon or aarthik sansthaaon ke ekikaran kii zarurat ko rekhaankit hi nahin kiya balki yah bhi kaha ki yah ekikaran aam taur par ho chukaa he
 He said that after all, both types of institutions represent their respective systems, there is interdependence between them and both play an essential role in achieving results
 meresan kaa kahana tha ki arthshaastra ko pramukhataa deni aavashyak he, par yah use raajnneeti se kaat kar nahin di ja sakati
 Each social institution is created by combining different types of incentives from economic and political aspects
 behatar saamaajik sanstha vah hoti he jisamen yah mishran budhimaneepurvak kiya jaataa he
 Only then is she able to make active and coordinated efforts to overcome wrong decisions and various obstacles
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki arthshaastra or raajnneetishastra ke algaav ne gyaan ke kshetra ko viksit karne main ahm yogadan kiya he
 Many generations of scholars have presented many theories and ideas without studying each other independently and autonomously
 is prakriya main naye or behatar vishleshnatmak pariprekshyon main vishay ko punah paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 But, from a practical point of view, this separation never opened the way to the development of purely economic or purely political science
 ab ek baar phir donon ke ekikaran kii charchaa hone lagi he, haalaanki donon hi anushasano ke vidwaan pehle se hi parasparavyapee kshetron main karyrat hai
 Even in neoliberal policies this dependence has increased

 Its origin is also believed to be from the Moon, that is why the Adinirmata Chandra of "chandratrayanarendranam dynasty" has been praised in earlier articles

 kautilya kaa 'arthshaastra' raajnneetik siddhanton kii ek mahatvapurn kriti he
 In this connection, the question arises why Kautilya named his book 'arthashastra'? In ancient times the term 'arthashastra' was used in a broader sense
 iske antagart multah raajnneetishastra, dharamshastra, arthshaastra, kanoon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa tha
 In the view of Acharya Kautilya, political science is an independent science and its branches are investigation, trilogy and dialogue and law
 sampoorn samaaj kii raksha raajnneeti yaa dand vyavastha se hoti he yaa rakshit praja hi apane-apane karttavya kaa paalan kar sakati he
 At that time economics was considered the scripture of politics and administration
 mahabharat main is sambandh main ek prasang he, jisamen arjuna ko arthshaastra kaa visheshgy mana gaya he
 Certainly, Kautilya's Arthashastra would also have been taken as a form of Rajashastra, as he has given many interpretations of the meaning
 kautilya ne kaha he— manuyana vrutirarthah arthath manushyon kii jeevika ko 'arth' kehete hai
 Explaining the Arthashastra, he has said - Tasya Prithivya Gnanapalanopaya: Shastra marth-shastramiti
 is prakaar yah bhi spasht he ki 'arthshaastra' ke antargat rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha donon se sambandhit siddhanton kaa samavesh he
 In fact, it would not be appropriate to call Kautilya 'arthashastra' only a scripture of polity and economy
 vastav main, yah arthvyavastha, rajvyastha, vidhi vyavastha, samaaj vyavastha or dharm vyavastha se sambandhit shaastra he
 Many other Arthasastras were composed before Kautilya's 'arthashastra', although his manuscripts are not available
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi arth, kaam or dharm ke sanyog or sammilan ke liye prayaas kiye jate rahe hai or uske liye shastron, smritiyon or puraanon main vishad charchaayen kii gayi hai
 Kautilya has also explained the meaning of 'arthashastra', measures of attainment of Artha, Kama and Dharma
 vatsyayan ke 'kamasutra' main bhi arth, dharm or kaam ke sambandh main sutron kii rachana kii gayi he
 Kautilya himself has also accepted the creation of his earlier economics
 apane 'arthshaastra' main kai sandarbhon main usne acharya brihaspati, bharadwaj, shukracharya, parashar, pishun, vishalaksh aadi aacharyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Prior to Kautilya, the texts of many Acharyas are named as Dandaniti
 aisa prathit hota he ki kautilya ke purv shaastra dandniti kahe jate the or ve arthshaastra ke samroop hote the
 But as many scholars have admitted that both politics and economics are not identical
 you
 en
 ghoshaal ke kathananusaar arthshaastra zyada vyapak shaastra he, jabaki dandniti maatr uski shakha he
 The scriptures written after Kautilya became known as 'niti Shastra', like Kamandaka Niti'sar
 vaise kai vidwaanon ne arthshaastra ko nitishastra kii apeksha zyada vyapak mana he
 However, in the opinion of most scholars, both ethics and economics are similar and both have the same subject area
 swayan kaamandak ne nitishastra or arthshaastra ko samroop mana he
 It is clear from the above discussion that scriptures like 'arthashastra' were composed before and after Kautilya's 'arthashastra'
 is sambandh main aise vidwaanon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya he jo yah maanate hai ki kautilya 'arthshaastra' kaa rachanaakaar nahin tha
 The number of Western scholars is more among such scholars
 sten, jolly, winternij va kith is prakaar ke vichaar ke pratipadak hai
 Indian scholar R
 G
 Bhandarkar has also supported this
 bhandarkar ne kaha he ki patanjali ne mahabhashya main kautilya kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 Those who did not recognize Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra', have presented the following arguments in support of their view- pustak kii samaapti par spasht rup se likhaa gaya he- It has also been written: vishnu puraana main is ghatana kii charchaa is tarah kii gai he: Confirming the incident, Kamantak, the doer of 'nitisara', wrote: in uddharanon se spasht he ki vishnugupt or kautilya ek hi vyakti the
 In the 'arthashastra' itself, at the end of the tenth chapter of the second tribunal, the name of the author of the book is named 'kautilya': pustak ke armbh main ‘kautilyon kruthan shastram’ tathaa prayek adhyay ke ant main ‘iti kautilierthshastre’ likhakar granthkaar ne apane ‘kautilya naam ko adhik vikhyath kiya he
 Wherever the opinion of other Acharyas has been expressed, in the end there is 'iti Kautilya' i
e
 Kautilya's opinion - saying thus has shown more favor to the name Kautilya
 parantu yah sarvatha nirvivaad he ki vishnugupt tathaa kautilya abhinn vyakti the
 If the later Dandi poet called it Acharya Vishnugupta, Banabhatta called it Kautilya
 donon kaa kathan he ki is acharya ne ‘dandniti’ athwa ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana kii
 In the Panchatantra, the name of this Acharya has been given as Chanakya, the author of economics
 kavi vishakhdutt-pranit suprasiddh naatak ‘mudrarakshas’ main chanakya ko kabhi kautilya tathaa kabhi vishnugupt naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 'arthashastra' was created for the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta as a 'rule of law'
 at: isaki rachana kaa kaal vahi maananaa uchit he, jo samraat chandragupta kaa kaal he
 Archaeological scholars dated this period to 321 BC
 From 296 BC Till sure
 kai anya vidwaan samraat cendrakotus ke aadhaar par nishchit kii hui is tithi ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Sukhya Moolam Dharma: dharmasy mulan arthh
 Meaning states
 rajyasy mulan indriya jayah
 Indriyajasya Moolam Vinayah
 vinayasy mulan vridhopaseva
sukh kaa mul he, dharm
 Meaning of religion is Artha
 arth kaa mul he, rajya
 The root of the kingdom is victory over the senses
 indriyajay kaa mul he, vinay
 The core of Vinay is service to the aged
 jaise upar kaha gaya he, iskaa mukhya vishay shashan-vidhi athwa shashan-vigyaan he: ‘‘kautilyon narendrarthey shashansy vidhi: krit:
 "it is clear from these words that Acharya composed it as a method of political science and especially governance
 arthshaastra kii vishay-suchi ko dekhne se yah sarvatha pramanit ho jaataa he ki ise aajkal kahe jane vaale arthshaastra kii pustak kahana bhul he
 At the beginning of the first tribunal itself, Acharya himself has informed it by the name 'dandaniti'
 shukracharya ne dandniti ko itani mahatvapurn vidya batalaaya he ki isamen anya sab vidyaon kaa antarbhaav maan liya he- kyonki 'shastren rakshite deshe shastrachintaa pravartate' kii ukti ke anusaar shastr dwaara sushasit tathaa surakshit desh main hi veda aadi anya shastron kii chintaa yaa anushilan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to accept penalism as the basic discipline of all other disciplines, and the same punishment is economics
 jise aajkal arthshaastra kaha jaataa he, uske liye 'vaarta' shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, yadhyapi yah shabd purnataya arthshaastra kaa dyotak nahin
 Kautilya has said three parts of the dialogue - agriculture, commerce and animal husbandry, from which often the profession or livelihood was earned
 manu, yajyavlky aadi shaastrakaron ne bhi in teen angon vaale vaartashastra ko sweekaar kiya he
 Shukracharya has also included Kusid in this dialogue as a means of instinct
 parantu arthshaastra ko sabhi shaastrakaron ne dandniti, raajnneeti athwa shashanvigyaan ke rup main hi varnit kiya he
 Therefore, it would be better to consider 'kautilya Arthashastra' as a book of politics and not a book of wealth
 vaise isamen kahin-kahin sampattishastra ke dhanotpaadan, dhanopbhog tathaa dhan-vinimay, dhan-vibhaajan aadi vishyon kii bhi praasangik charchaa kii gai he
 The opening verse of the first tribunal of 'kautilya Arthashastra' is going to throw more light in this regard: arthath-pracheen aacharyon ne prithvi jeetne or paalan ke upaay batalaane vaale jitne arthshaastra likhe hai, praayah un sabakaa saar lekar is ek arthshaastra kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Where this quote explains the subject of economics, it also illuminates the truth that before the 'kautilya Arthashastra', many masters composed the Arthashastra, which was intended to propose measures for conquering the earth and its observance
 un aacharyon tathaa unke sampradaayon ke kuch naamon kaa nirdesan ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main kiya gaya he, yadhyapi unki kritiyaan aaj uplabdh bhi nahin hotin
 This name is the following: arthshaastra ke in das sampradaayon ke aacharyon main praaia: sabhi ke sambandh main kuch-na-kuch gyaat he, parantu vishalaksh ke bare main bahut kam parichay praapt hota he
 It is very clear from these names that many great thinkers and philosophers got attention towards economics ethics and a bright literature was produced on this subject
 aaj vah sahitya lupt ho chukaa he
 Due to many foreign invasions and state revolutions, this literature has remained nameless, but whatever literature is residual indicates a wide economical tradition
 is arthshaastra main ek aisi shashan-paddati kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he jisamen raja yaa shaasha praja kaa kalyaan sampaadan karne ke liye shashan karata he
 The king cannot rule arbitrarily
 use mantriparishad kii sahaayta praapt karke hi praja par shashan karnaa hota he
 The state-priest is like a curse on the king, who can control the king if he is disinherited from the religious path and can force him to perform his duty
 sarvalokahitkaari raashtra kaa jo swaroop kautilya ko abhipret he, vah ‘arthshaastra’ ke nimnlikhit vachan se spasht he- That is, the happiness of the king is in the happiness of the people, it is in the interest of the people
 raja kaa apana priy kuch nahin he, praja kaa priy hi uskaa priy he
 Around 400 CE, Kamandaka wrote an Arthashastra based on Kautilya's Arthashastra, a poetic form divided into 20 cantos called Kamandikeya Nitisara
 yah naitikta or videsh-niti ke siddhanton par bhi vichaar karata he
 The ethics of Somdev Suri, the short economics of Hemachandra, the Yuktikalpataru of Bhoja, the Venus of Venus, etc
 are some other well-known economics, which can also be counted under texts explaining the practical side of ethics

 After the indo-pak war of 1971, a treaty was signed in Shimla, India
 ise shimla samjhauta kehete hai
 It included Indira Gandhi from India and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto from Pakistan
 yah samjhauta bharat or pakistan ke bich disambar 1971 main hui ladaai ke baad kiya gaya tha, jisamen pakistan ke 93000 se adhik sainikon ne apane leftinent general niaji ke netritv main bhartiya sena ke saamne aatmasamarpan kiya tha or tatkaaleen purvi pakistan ko bangladesh ke rup main pakistani shashan se mukti praapt hui thi
 The then Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto arrived in Shimla on 28 June 1972 with his daughter Benazir Bhutto to reach this agreement
 ye vahi bhutto the, jinhone ghaas kii roti khaakar bhi bharat se hajaar saal tak jang karne kii kasame khaayi thim
 From 28 June to 1 July, both sides held several rounds of talks but could not reach any agreement
 iske liye pakistan kii hathdharmi hi mukhya rup se jimmedaar thi
 Suddenly on July 2, the two sides reached an agreement before lunch, while Bhutto was to return the same day
 is samjhaute par pakistan kii ore se benazir bhutto or bharat kii ore se indira gandhi ne hastakshar kiye the
 It is not difficult to understand that there was pressure from some big foreign power on India to make this agreement
 is samjhaute se bharat ko pakistan ke sabhi 93000 se adhik yudhbandi chhodane pade or yuddh main jiti gayi 5600 varg mile jameen bhi lautaani pade
 No one knows what India got in return
 yahan tak ki pakistan main bharat ke jo 54 yudhbandi the, unako bhi bharat waapas nahin le sakaa or ve 41 saal se aaj bhi apane desh lautne kii pratiksha kar rahe hai
 Taking everything in its stride, Pakistan gave a brief assurance to India that all disputes between India and Pakistan, including Kashmir, would be resolved through mutual negotiations and would not be raised in international forums
 lekin is akele aashwaasan kaa bhi pakistan ne saikadon baar ulanghan kiya he or kashmir vivaad ko puri nirlajjataa ke saath anek baar anterrashtriya manchon par uthaaya he
 In fact for him, the value of an agreement is not as much as the value of the paper on which that agreement is written
 is samjhaute main bharat or pakistan ke bich yah bhi tay hua tha ki 17 disambar 1971 arthath pakistani senaaon ke aatmasamarpan ke baad donon deshon kii senaayen jis sthiti main thim, us rekha ko ”vaastavik niyantran rekha“ mana jayega or koi bhi paksh apni ore se is rekha ko badalane yaa uskaa ulanghan karne kii koshish nahin karegaa
 But Pakistan also did not stick to its promise
 sab jaanate hai ki 1999 main kargil main pakistani sena ne jaanboojhkar ghuspaith kii or is kaaran bharat ko kargil main yuddh ladanaa padaa
 Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took over as the President of Pakistan on 20 December 1971
 unhen viraasat main ek tutaa hua pakistan mila
 After assuming power, Bhutto promised that he would soon rejoin Bangladesh in Pakistan
 pakistani sena ke anek adhikariyon ko desh kii paraajay ke liye uttaradaayi maan kar barkhaast kar diya gaya
 The india-pakistan summit was held in Shimla in late June 1972 after several months of political-level negotiations
 indira gandhi or bhutto ne apane ucchstareey mantriyon or adhikariyon ke saath un sabhi vishyon par charchaa kii jo 1971 ke yuddh se utpann hue the
 At the same time they also discussed other questions of both countries
 in main kuch pramukh vishay the yuddh bandiyon kii adla-badali, pakistan dwaara bangladesh ko manyata kaa prashn, bharat or pakistan ke rajanyik sambandhon ko saamaanya bananaa, vyapaar phir se shuru karnaa or kashmir main niyantran rekha sthapit karnaa
 After lengthy negotiations, Bhutto agreed that india-pakistan relations would be decided only by bilateral negotiations
 shimla samjhaute ke ant main ek samjhaute par indira gandhi or bhutto ne hastakshar kiye
 Its provisions are as follows - inamen yah praavdhaan kiya gaya ki donon desh apane sangharsh or vivaad samaapt karne kaa prayaas karenge or yah vachan diya gaya ki up-mahadweep main sthai mitrataa ke liye kaary kiya jayega
 For these purposes Indira Gandhi and Bhutto decided that the two countries would negotiate directly for the peaceful resolution of all disputes and problems and would not take any change in any situation by taking unilateral action
 ve ek duusare ke virudgh na to bal prayog karenge, na pradeshik akhandta kii avehalanaa karenge or na hi ek duusare kii raajnneetik swatantraaa main koi hastkshep karenge
 Both governments will stop the propaganda against each other and encourage the news that will develop friendship in the relationship

 But when Austerlitz was defeated in the war, Austria had to accept a shameful treaty of the press class
 is safalataa se napolian kaa ullas bad gaya or ab usne germany ko raudna prarambh kiya
 He strengthened the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte by creating the Treaty of Rhine, defeating the wars of Jena and Arsed in 14 October 1806
 ab keval rus rah gaya jise napolian ne june 1807 i main freedland ke yuddh main haraakar july 1807 kii tilsit kii sandhi ke liye vivash kiya
 Once the master of all Europe, Napoleon waged an economic war to defeat England
 saare europe ke rashtron kaa vyapaar england se band kar diya tathaa europe kii sari seemaa par ek kathor niyantran lagu kiya
 Britain promulgated a prohibitive command to stop France's trade with the nations of Europe to its north
 britain ne apni kshatipurti upaneveshon se vyapaar badha kar kar lee, kintu europea rashtron kii aarthik sthiti bigadane lagi or ve france kii is yatnaa se peedit ho uthe
 Spain first revolted against this system
 parinamswaroop napolian ne spain par chadhaai kii or vahaan kii satta chin lee
 This sparked a national uprising in Spain
 nepolian isko dabaa bhi nahin paaya tha ki use austria ke vidroh ko dabaanaa padaa or phir kram se prasha or rus ne bhi is vyavastha kii avagya kii
 Russia's rebellion proved disastrous for Napoleon

 at: mitra rashtron ne use 1815 main waterlu ke yuddh main haraakar saint helena kaa karawas diya
 He died there on May 5 in 1821
 nepolian bonapart ne 1799 main satta ko haathon main lekar apni sthiti sudrudh karne tathaa france ko prashasnic sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn kshetron main sudhaar kiye
 In fact, the Nepalese had taken over power by ending the rule of the directory and the people of France had accepted that change, then the reason was that it had grown from chaos and chaos
 atah nepolian ke liye yah jaruri tha ki vah aantarik kshetra main ek suvyavasthit shashan or kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana kare
 After becoming First Counsel, Napoleon created a new Constitution for France which was the fourth constitution of the Revolution era
 iske dwaara karypalika shakti teen kanusalaron main nihit kar di gai
 The Principal Counsel had more power than other Counselors
 vastav main samvidhan main ganatantr kaa dikhaaya to jarur tha lekin rajya kii sampoorn satta nepalian ke haathon main kendrit thi
 Napoleon centralized the governance and abolished the local governments of the Departments and Districts and appointed the prefects and sub-prefects
 inaki niyukti tathaa gaanv or shaharon ke sabhi meyaron kii niyukti sidhe kenndriya sarkaar dwaara kii jane lagi
 In this way, Napoleon, the administration's field, kept adequate control over these officers and kept the administration in order and appointed them on the basis of merit
 prashasnic kshetron main nepolian ke sudhaar ek prakaar se kranti ke virdohi ke rup main the kyonki neshnal essembali ne kranti ke dauraan prashasnic dhaanche kaa purna vikendrikaran kar diya tha tathaa desh kaa shashan chalaane kaa daayitv nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko diya gaya tha lekin nepalian ne is vyavastha ko ulat diya or krantipurv vyavastha ko phir se sthapit kiya
 From that point of view he was a laughingstock of revolution
 nepolian ne france kii jarjar aarthik sthiti se use ubaarane kaa praytn kiya
 In this sequence, he first simplified the tax system
 kar vasuulne kaa kaary kendriya karmchaariyon ke jimme kiya tathaa uski vasuuli sakhti se kii jane lagi
 He prohibited unfair profits in bribery, betting, contracting
 usne mitvyayita par bal diya or france kii janata par anek apratyaksh kar lagaae
 Napoleon established the Bank of France to carry out the financial activities in France, which still exists today
 rashtriya rin ko chukaane ke liye usne ek pruthak kosh kii bhi sthapana kii
 As far as possible Napoleon put the burden of military expenditure on the conquered territories and tried to keep the French people free from this burden
 nepolian ne krishi ke sudhaar par bhi bal diya or banjar or retile ilaake ko upjau banane kii yojana banaai
 Napoleon paid considerable attention to the means of transport for the development of trade
 sadaken, naharen banavaai gai vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon kii pragati ke liye yantric shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 To popularize French industrial goods, encouraged the exhibition and encouraged indigenous goods and industries
 berogari kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye nirmaan kaary ko protsaahan diya
 In this way Napoleon recovered France from a state of shabby and insolvency
 kintu aarthik sudhaaron kii drushti se bhi nepolian ke kaary kranti virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 In the Revolution, emphasis was placed on direct taxes, while Napoleon tried to establish an archaic system by emphasizing indirect taxes
 isi prakaar nepolian ne vanijyivaadee darshan ko praathamikta dekar krantivirdohi maansikta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He believed that the state would have to take active intervention to bring balance between the security of the fund and trade, whereas the force of revolution was on free trade
 nepalian aise nagarikon ko chahta tha jo uske evam uske tantra ke prati vishwaas rakhe
 For this, he made reforms by adopting national and secular forms of education
 shiksha ko praathmik, madhyamik or ucch staron par sangathit kiya
 These schools run with the help of teachers appointed by the government, used to have the same curriculum, the same textbooks and the same uniform
 nepolian ne paris main ek vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii or usamen latin, french, vigyaan, ganit ityadi vishyon kii shiksha di jaati thi
 This university was not a university in the general sense of the university, but made a system that tied all the institutions from primary to higher education together
 shiksha par adhikadhik sarkari niyantran rakhana tathaa vidhyaarthiyon ko shashan ke prati nishthavan bananaa iskaa uddeshy tha
 Napoleon founded the Institute of France for research work
 nepolian kii nari shiksha main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 The burden of their education was left to religious institutions
 france kii bahusankhyak janata catholic carch ke prabhaav main thi
 During the revolution, the power of the church was weakened and brought under the kingdom
 carch kii sampati kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya or padariyon ko rajya kii vafadari kii shapath lene ko kaha gaya
 This angered the Pope and incited the general public to protest
 faltah sarkaar or aamajanata ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Napoleon made a pact with the Pope from 1801 called Concardate to overcome it
 uske nimnlikhit praavdhaan the
 Napoleon's most important and permanent work was the creation of the Code of Law
 vastutah kranti ke pehle france kii kanoon vyavastha chhin-bhinn thi or itane prakaar ke kanoon the ki kanoon kaa paalan karaane waalon ko bhi unka gyaan nahin tha or kranti ke dauraan bhi yah araajaktaa bad gai thi
 Napoleon overcame this chaos
 swayan nepolian apni vidhi samhita ko apane 40 yudhon se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 By this code Napoleon established the universal law system in France
 naagarik samhita ke tahat usne parivaar ke mukhiya kaa adhikaar sudrudh kiya
 Women are placed under men and the husband's job is to protect the wife
 talaak kii paddati ko kathin banaaya gaya
 Civil marriage was also arranged in this code
 is prakaar civil vivaah or talaak kii pratha ko manyata dekar nepolian ne europe main is baat kaa prachlan kiya ki bina padariyon ke sahyog ke bhi samaaj kaa kaam chal saktaa he
 Thus other codes such as the Code of Criminal Proc
 Etc
 were created
 uske vyapaarik code main shramjiviyon ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai thi or unke sanghon par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa gaya tha
 In this view Napoleon worked against the ideals of revolution
 iske baavjood is vidhi samhita kii mahatta samooche desh main kanoon kii ekarupata pradaan karne tathaa vyaavhaarik rup se nyaay vyavastha ko aasaan banane main thi
 This code was enforced wherever Napoleon's armies went and remained intact even after Napoleon's defeat
 yah nepolian kii ek sthaayee kirti he
 Napoleon's Code of Law emphasizes the interests of the bourgeoisie more
 bhoomi sambandhi adhikari ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyakti sampati kii raksha ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyaktigat sampati kii raksha ke liye kai kanoon banaae
 Creating a trade union was declared a crime
 mukademen kii sthiti main mazdooron kii daleelon ke badale maalikon kii baton ko nyaayalayon ko maanane ko kaha gaya
 Social equality is also the basis of the civil code
 visheshadhikaar or saamanti niyam kaa samhita main koi sthaan nahin tha
 There was not even a law to consider the elder son as the heir to the property, all the sons were given equal rights on the property
 nepolian ne samaaj main ek naveen kuleen varg kii sthapana kii
 He determined the order of titles according to income
 nepolian kaa yah kaary kranti ke aadarshon ke vipareet tha
 Napoleon's appearance on the European political horizon was like a wandering wheel and he soon became the destiny of Europe on the strength of his process and hard work
 usamen adbhut sainik tathaa prashasnic kshamta se sabhi kochakit kar diya
 But his pillar of strength was like standing on the sand wall
 jo kuch hi varshon main dhwast ho gaya vastut: nepolian kaa utthan or patan chakachaundh karne vaali ulka ke samaan hua
 He shone in the sky of Europe on the strength of military success, but with defeat, the star of his destiny sank
 jis samrajya kii kathin parishram ke pashchaat kaayam kiya gaya tha vah dekhte hi dekhte samaapt ho gaya uske patan ke anek kaaran the jo sa prakaar he
 Infinitely ambitious nepolian aseem mahatvakankshi tha
 The infinite great ambition proves to be the main cause of a person's downfall
 nepolian ke saath bhi yahi baat thi
 As the war progressed, his ambition increased and he began to dream of establishing a world state
 yadi thode se hi vah santusht ho jaataa or jite hue samrajya kii dekhbhaal karata or apana samay usamen lagaataa to use patan kaa durdasha nahin dekhnaa padataa
 Character weakness nepolian main saahas sanyam or dhairya kut- kut kar bharaa tha parantu uski drushti main ghrinaa uskaa pratishodh uskaa kartavya tathaa kshamaadaan kalank tha
 The great weakness of his character was that he did not consider the treaty to be a respected agreement
 kisi bhi desh kii maitri uske liye raajnneetik aavashyaktaa se adhik nahin thi
 Gradually he became stubborn
 He believed that every step of his was okay
 vah kabhi bhul nahin kar saktaa vah dusron kii salaah kii upeksha karne laga
 As a result, his true friends also went away from him
 nepolian kii vyavastha kaa sanyavad par aadhaarit hona- His political system was based on militarism which proved to be the primary cause of its downfall
 vah sabhi maamalon main sena par nirbhar rahata tha falat: vah hameshaa yuddh main hi ulajhaa rahaa
 He forgot that militarism can only be beneficial in times of crisis
 jab tak france vipattiyon ke badal chhaae rahe vahaan kii janata ne uskaa saath diya vipattiyon ke hatate hi janata ne uskaa saath dena chhod diya
 Losing the sympathy and love of the French public proved fatal to him
 uske atirikt parajeet raashtra uske shatru banate gaye jo avasar milte hi uske khilaaf uth khadey hue
 The historian Kabban has rightly written
 ‘nepolian kaa samrajya yuddh main panpa tha yuddh hi uske astitv kaa aadhaar tha or yuddh main hi uskaa ant hua
 ' doshapurn sainik vyavastha- Initially, the French army was steeped in the spirit of patriotism
 uske samaksh ek adarsh kaa or vah ek uddeshy kii purti ke liye yuddh karata tha
 But as his empire expanded, the national form of the army became legalized
 pehle uski sena main francisi sainik te parantu baad main usamen german italian purtegali or dach sainik shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a result, his army became the army of many states
 unke saamne koi adarsh or uddeshy nahin tha
 Hence, his military power continued to weaken and this proved to be an important reason for his downfall
 nausena kii durbalata- Napoleon had properly organized the army, but he lacked a powerful navy, which caused him to be defeated by England
 agar uske paas shaktishaalee nausena hoti to use england se parajeet nahin hona padataa
 Lack of patriotism in the conquered territories usne jin pradeshon par vijay praapt kii vahin kii janata ke hryday main uske prati sadbhaavna or prem nahin tha
 They hated Napoleon's rule
 jab uski shakti kamjor padane lagi to uske adhinsth rajya apni swatantraaa ke liye praytn karne lage
 The European nation formed a fourth bloc for the League against him and consequently was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo
 pope se shatruta- Due to the continental system, he made the Pope his enemy
 jab pope ne usee mahadwipiya vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya to usne april 1808 main rome par adhikaar kar liya
 And in 1809 AD, the Pope was imprisoned, leading Catholics to believe that Napoleon was the only demon destroying the freedoms of the states
 varanaa unka dharm nasht karne vaala bhi he
 industrial Revolution- kaha jaataa he ki uski paraaj waterlu ke maidan main na hokar manchester ke kaarkaanon or barkingdhan ke lohe ke bhadiyaan main hui
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, large-2 factories were opened in England and England became prosperous upon seeing it
 falat: vah apni sena kii aadhunik hatyar se sampann kar sakaa jo nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Continental system mahadwipiya vyavastha uski jabardast bhul thi
 He considered England as his biggest enemy
 england kii shakti kaa mukhya aadhaar nausena or vishwavyaapee vyapaar ta uski nausakti ko nepolian samaapt nahin kar sakaa isliye uske vyapaar par aghat karne kii cheshtaa kii gai
 For this purpose, he gave birth to the continental system, he issued an order that no country can do trade with England
 or na to england kii bani hui vastu kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 This was Napoleon's terrible mistake
 is vyavastha ne use ek aise jaal main fasaa diya jisase nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, the continental system is considered to be the main reason for its collapse
 purtegal ke saath yuddh – Purtigal had a commercial relationship with England, but Napoleon's pressure forced him to break ties with England
 isse purtegal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Therefore, he again established a commercial relationship with England
 isapar nepolian ne krodhit hokar purtegal par akraman kar diya
 This too proved fatal for Napoleon
 spain ke saath sangharsh- Napoleon's third mistake was his interference in Spain's internal affairs
 iske lakhon sainik maare gaye
 As a result, his position in this war became absolutely weak
 jisase uske virodhiyon ko protsaahan mila jab nepolian ne apane bhai ko spain kaa raja banaaya to vahaan ke nivasee us videshi ko raja maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 He drove Napoleon's army from Spain
 us vidroh se anya deshon ko bhi protsaahan mila or ve bhi vidroh karne lage jisase uskaa patan avashyambhavi ho gaya
 Russia's campaign nepolian ne rus par akraman kar baari bhul kii rus ne isaki mahadwipiya vyavastha ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Napoleon attacked Russia at this
 isamen yaddhapi masco par iskaa aadhikaar ho gaya lekin use mahaan kshati uthaani padi
 His opponents planned to attack
 ise akraman main use parajeet hona padaa
 Fatigue anek yuddh main lagaataar vyast rahane ke kaaran vah thak chukaa tha 50 sailaaniyon ne likhaa he nepolian ke patan kaa samast kaaran ek hi shabd thakaan main nihit he
 As he got entangled in the war, as his power weakened, he became tired and due to this his downfall became necessary
 sagesambandhi- His immediate relatives were no less responsible for his downfall
 halanki vah apane sambandhiyon ke prati udaartaa kaa bartaav karata tha
 But whenever he was in trouble, his relatives did not help him
 chaturthgut ke sanghathan- Taking advantage of the weakness of Napoleon, his enemies formed the fourth faction and the Allies defeated him
 use pakad kar salbai bheja gaya or use vahaan kaa swatantra shaasha banaaya gaya lekin nepolian vahaan bahut dinon tak nahin rah sakaa vah sheeghra hi france laut gaya or vahaan kaa shaasha ban baitha
 But this time he remained the emperor for only a hundred days
 mitra rashtron ne 18 june 1815 i
 ko waterlu ke yuddh main antim rup se parajeet kar diya
 The captured Allies sent him as a prisoner to an island called St
 Helena where he died in 1821, at the age of 52 years
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi kaaran pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se uske patan ke liye uttaradaayi the usne yuddh ke dwaara hi apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha or yudhon ke chalate hi uskaa patan bhi hua
 That is, those elements who built Napoleon's empire also destroyed them

 The Greek alphabet is a twenty four letter system using which the Greek language is being written since the eighth century BC
 prayek swar evam vyanjan liye pruthak chinh vaali yah pehali evam pracheenatam varnmaala he
 This alphabet originated from the Phoenician alphabet and many of Europe's alphabets originate from it

 After the second century BCE, mathematicians also started using Greek letters to represent numbers
 unani varnon kaa prayog vigyaan ke kai kshetron main kiya jaataa he, jaise bhautikee main tatwon ke naam, sitaron ke naam, birdari evam saathi sampradaay ke naam, ooshna katibandheey chakravaaton ke naam ke liye
 The emergence of the Greek alphabet centuries after the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and after the disuse of the earlier Greek writing system, the Linear b script, in the eighth century BC
 Happened in the middle of rekhiy bi kaa udbhav rekhiy e se hua jo ki minoai sabhyataa dwaara viksit thi, jinaki bhashaa unani se sambandhit nahin thi, parinamswaroop minoai aksharmala unani bhashaa kii dhvaniyon ke lipyantaran hetu adarsh madhyam uplabdh nahin karaatin
 The Greek alphabet prevailing today developed after the Greek dark period, that is, the decline of the Mycenaean civilization and the rise of ancient Greece, which was about 800 BC
 It was the time between the epics of Homer and the beginning of the ancient Olympic Games in 776 BC
 dhvanyatmak phonishian varnmaala ke ek anukalan ke rup main, iskaa sabase ullekhneey parivartan, swar aksharon kaa samaveshan he, jiske bina unani apthaneey hoti
 Vowel signs were not originally used in the Semitic alphabet
 purvavarti pashchimi simitic lipi parivaar main, ek avishisht swar ke saath vyanjan hetu ek akshar hameshaa prayukt kiya gaya
 This did not reduce readability as the word in semitic languages is based on triaxial roots that explain meaning only by the presence of consonants and vowels are clarified by context
 vipareet, unani ek bhaaropee bhashaa he atah swar main antar arth main bada antar paidaa karata he
 Therefore, the Greek alphabet divided the letters into two categories - vowels and consonants, where a consonant must be used with a vowel to become an accentable unit

 In Eastern Greek, which lacked complete pronunciation, the semitic glottal consonant / ħ / ka h) was also used for long vowels / ɛː / and finally Ω) The letter began to be used for long / ɔː / 
 The reason for the inclusion of long open letters e and o lies in oral morphological study of the language
 paramparaagat greek main nishchayatmak evam sambhaavnarthak aksharon main spasht bhed tha jo ki ‘ε ) vs

 Greek also included three new consonant letters Φ), Χ) and Ψ) which are given at the end of the alphabet according to their development
 ye vyanjan dhvanyatmak aksharon main tulana yogya uccharanon ke abhaav main bane the
 In Western Greek, x was used for / ks / and ψ was used for / kh / - so the Latin letter x is derived from the Western Greek alphabet

 The Greek script underwent parallel changes to the Latin alphabet during the medieval period: while the old forms remained as memorized scripts, the one-inch and ultimately shorter forms became dominant
 At the end of the word, similar to the Latin long and heart s, σ was written similarly ς
