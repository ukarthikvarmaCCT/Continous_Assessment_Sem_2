 Rudolph Diesel was born in Paris
 inke matapita san 1870 se england main rahane lage, kintu apen bete ko inhone germany main ogsvarg or munich ke kalejon main padhane bheja
 After his education, he was manager of a factory of glass machines in Paris for some time, but then returned to Munich! munich main inhone ve anusandhan aarambh kiye jinke aadhaar par bhavishya main deazal ingine bana
 In 1893, he wrote a book related to the same research called The Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor
 isi varsh croop tathaa ogsburg ke kaarkaanon main deazal injanon kaa nirmaan aarambh hua, kintu isko vyaavhaarik rup dene main inhen chaar varsh lage
 In 1899, he opened the factory to manufacture these engines in Augsburg and spent the rest of his life making these engines fully useful

 is shrenee main nimnlikhit 7 upashreniyan hai, kul upashreniyan 7 The following 33 pages are in this category, total 33 pages sambhraant varg yaa filit samajashaastra or raajnneeti main kisi samaaj yaa samudaay main us chote se gut ko kehete hai jo apni sankhya se kahin zyaada dhan, rajnatik shakti yaa saamaajik prabhaav rakhata he
 The elite is more powerful in its field than other sections of society
 saamaajik jivan ke kisi bhi kshetra main niyantrankari sanrachanaon ke sheersh par maujuud chote se or apekshaakrit samroop samooh ko abhijan kii sangya di jaati he
 The Latin word 'ELITE', synonymous with it, means chosen or best
 ilit banane ke liye liye satta, suvidha, yogyata or sanghathan or netritvkaari kshamta hona anivaary he
 In order to continue any system or system, it is considered necessary to run the operations of a group of well-qualified persons and from time to time, people with similar abilities are selected to take their place
 yah aagrah sheersh yaa netritv main abhijan kii nirantarata kii guarantee karata he
 Elite's interpreter Pareto says that Elite possesses special psychological qualities based on power, using notoriety, deceit, strength, and judicious initiative
 chunki abhijanon kaa gut chota sa hota he isliye use adhik sangathit or susangat rup se karrwai karne main aasaani hoti he
 Its members maintain constant contact with each other, so that the policy-making process is not interrupted on the basis of mutual consensus
 aisi baat nahin ki abhijan hameshaa hi apni satta bachaane main kaamyaab rahete hon
 The blame for their failure is usually attributed to lack of political skill or will power
 samaaj ke saath jeevant sampark rakhte hue naye vichaaron ko grahan karke apana punarsanskaar karte rahane vaale abhijan lambe arase tak tike rahete hai
 Those elites who do not do so, their time is over and the counter-elite standing against them takes power from their hands, leading a 'mass' or mass group
 shuru main abhijan siddhanth ek loktantr virdohi avadharana thi jiskaa sutrikaran shaskaon ke praadhikaar ko nyaaysangat tehraane ke kiya gaya tha taaki europe kii viksit ho rahi loktantric shashan paddati kii vaidhata ko chunauti di ja sake
 Later in the middle of the twentieth century, the insights of this theory were tried to confirm the democratic theory
 iske peeche makasad samyavaadee yaa fasivadi netritv main chal rahe janandolanon se udaarataavaadi loktantr ko bachaana tha
 In democracy, not all the elite are in power
 aaj kii loktantric vyavasthaaon main abhijanon ke kai samooh satta kii bagdor apane haath main rakhane ke liye aapas main pratiyogita karte hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 In order to join the membership of the already frozen elite group, new ones keep coming on the platform of democracy
 shuru main abhijanon kaa chayan keval ucch varg se hi kiya jaataa tha, lekin ab nichle or vanchit samajhe jane vaale tabakon kii netritvkaari shaktiyaan bhi abhijanon kii shrenee main shaamil kar lee jaati hai
 The democracy is considered more successful and durable with the size of the elites increasing
 iske vipareet jahaan abhijan apana aakaar badhane ke kilaaf morchabandi kar lete hai, un loktantron main vyavastha baar-baar sankatagrast hoti rahati he
 The eligibility principle is fundamentally based on the ancient belief that society is divided into a handful of rulers and majority ruled
 plato ne shashan karne ke liye aise logon kii shinaakht karne kaa suzav diya tha jinke paas hukumat karne ke liye aavashyak prakruti-pradutt yogyataayen hon
 It is a prevalent way of understanding history and politics to study the elites who have decision-making powers for the operation of various sectors of society
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main italvi samajashastriyon getano moska or wilfredo parato ke saath- saath moska ke german anuyaayi robert michels ne loktantric vyavasthaaon ke vikaas ke kilaaf pratikriya karte hue daawa kiya abhijanon kaa shashan maanviya itihaas ek pramukh lakshan he
 This formulation was against the egalitarian one promoted and confirmed by Marxism in the nineteenth century
 ye siddhantkaar marks se is bare main to sahamat the ki ateet main samaajon kaa netritv alpsankhyakon ke haathon main rahaa he, par unka yah bhi kahana tha ki ye alpsankhyak samooh anivaary taur par utpaadan ke sadhano ke swami nahin the
 The source of their dominance was not economic, rather their power came from diverse sources
 yah alag baat he ki apane prabhutv kaa laabh uthaa kar abhijan bade paimaane par dhan-sampatti jamaa kar lete the
 Mosca and Pareto also said that the pattern of leadership of future societies is going to remain the same
 haalaanki in vidwaanon ne aagrahpurvak kaha ki unka samaaj-vigyaan kisi mulya se bandhaa hua nahin he, par italy main ubharate hue fasiwad ke prati unki hamadardi kisi se chhipi hui nahin thi
 Pareto and Michaels were straightforward supporters of fascism and viewed fascism as a compulsion due to their resentment from the liberal Mosca Left
 kul mila kar in teenon siddhantkaron kii koshish thi ki sansadeey vyavastha keval ucch or madhyavarg kii bhagidaari tak hi simit rahani chahie
 He used to look at the Parliament representing workers and peasants contemptuously
 marxvaadi siddhantkaron or loktantric bahultawad ke pairokaron ne is abhijanwaad ko kadi chunauti di
 Marxists said that this theory failed to identify the basic basis of the dominance of the elite
 abhijan chaahe faujee hon, dharmik hon, raajnneetik hon yaa saanskrithik; unke prabhutv kii buniyaad aarthik varg-sambandhon main dekhi jaani chahie
 Pluralists argued that in modern, developed and liberal societies there is competition between diverse interests for power and domination
 isliye mutthi bhar abhijanon kaa gut sarvangin prabhutv kabhi sthapit nahin kar paata
 The decision making process is not just one
 is hakeekat ke vipareet abhijanwaad ke pairokaar udaarataavaad ke aadhaar par khadey samaajon main satta or uske sroton kaa adhyayan karne ke liye trutipurna paddati apanaate hai
 Although the elitism doctrine was anti-democracy, Joseph Schumpeter incorporated the elitist doctrine into elitist democratic theory in the mid-twentieth century
 unhone kaha ki loktantr main bhi shashan abhijanon ke haath main hi rahanaa chahie taaki vyavastha ko prabhavi or sthir hukmran lagaataar milte rahen
 The only condition is that such elites are selected through democratic processes
 yah vaicharik ejineering karne ke peeche shumpiter kaa uddeshy udaarataavaadi loktantr ko fasiwad athwa communism kaa samarthan karne vaale vyavastha-virdohi abhijanon ke netritv main chalane vaale andolanon se bachaana tha
 Taking a pluralistic theory, Schumpeter said that the liberal claim of power and multidimensionality of decision is not correct
 darasal prabhutv ke liye aapas main hode karne vaale samoohon kaa niyantran kuch thode se netaaon ke haath main rahata he jo aavashyak nahin ki apane samooh ke sadasyon kii ichchhaaon or zaruuraton ke hisaab se hi chalate hon
 Hence the competition between groups becomes a competition between their leaders
 nattejey taur bahultavaadi loktantr abhijanvaadee loktantr main badal jaataa he
 The sustainability and development of this idea of democracy is the result of the activism and commitment of its relatives, not dependent on the passive civil society
 loktantric vyavastha ho yaa nirankushta, abhijanon ke mahatva se puri tarah se inkaar karnaa mushkil he
 Some scholars argue that the interpreters of liberal democracy pay more attention to decisions taken under the influence of the masses
 is tarah abhijanon dwaara lee gayi pahalakadamiyon kii bhoomika par puraa prakaash nahin pad paata
 Sociologists interested in elite studies try to find out the social and educational backgrounds of leaders from various walks of social life to find out what factors influence them in the elites
 agar samaaj ke kisi hisse main ek se zyaada abhijan samooh sakriy hai to yah pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki unke bich kis tarah kaa saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik or vichaardhaaratmak antarsambandh he; or unamem ekikrut hone kii sambhaavnaayen hai yaa nahin
 a second dimension of elite study is the study of relationships between the elite and the public
 isamen yah jaanane kii koshish kii jaati he ki upar se neeche or neeche se upar is tarah ke sambandh kaa sanchaar kis tarah hota he
 The drawbacks of this relationship determine the status of the forces that wish to replace the elite
 is vishleshan se hi tay hota he ki kisi vishisht abhijan ko hataane ke liye shantipurna yaa krantikari tareekon ke peeche kya kaaran kaam kar rahe the
 C
 Wright Mills, who studies American elite, has formulated the concept of 'power Elite'
 mills ke anusaar sanyukt rajya america main teen tarah ke abhijan ekikrut ho kar hukumat karte hai
 These are industrial, political military
 dilachasp baat yah he ki anya siddhantkaron ke vipareet mills yah dikhaate hai ki abhijanon kii is tikdi se mil kar banane vaala power ilit loktantr ke liye kis tarah se nuksaandeh he
 The elite theory has also interfered in the field of culture-studies
 maas socity ke ubhaar kii aalochana karne vaale yah maan kar chalate hai ki samakaleen maas media or usase nikalne vaali lokapriy jan-samskruti abhijan samskruti kii shreshthata ke liye ghaatak hoti he
 Elite classes can be of many types, for example - aksar kisi ek prakaar ke sambhraant varg kaa sadsy anya kshetron ke sambhraant virgon kaa sadsy bhi hota he
 For example, it has been observed that in many societies, the best education, the most wealth and the greatest political power are found in the people of the same class

 ati pracheen kaal se hi chikitsa ke do pramukh vibhaag chale aa rahe hai - kaaychikitsa evam shalyachikitsa 
 On this basis, two traditions also run among physicians
 ek kaaychikitsak or doosraa shalyachikitsak 
 Although both of them have more or less general importance of drug treatment, the importance of a physician's handwriting in surgery is of major importance, whereas the main form of medicine is medicine
 ayurveda main bhi dhanvantari sampradaay, yaa sushrut sampradaay, shalyachikitsa ke pratik hai jabaki aatreya sampradaay yaa charak sampradaay kaaychikitsa ke pratik hai
 Similarly, in the time of Jalenus also in the West, only those who used medicine, ie physicians, were called medimi and armaments, called Chirarji and Bludnarari

 The original source of surgery from classical evidences is found in the Vedas, where the two Vaidyas of heaven, Ashvinikumaras, after Indra, Agni and Soma Devata are enumerated
 inke kaaychikitsa evam shalyachikitsa sambandhi donon prakaar ke kaary milte hai
 The prayer of Ashwini Kumaras has been done to remove the diseases of the body and to provide new eyes and new organs in the event of disorganization
 garbhashay ko chirakar garbh ko baahar nikaalane tathaa mutrvahini, mutrashay evam vrikkon main yadi mutr rukaa ho, to use vahaan se shalya karm yaa anya prakaar se baahar nikaalane kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Similarly, in the Atharvaveda, prayer has been made for adding Kshata, Vidyadhi, Vrana, broken or broken bones, healing the severed limb, healing the severed flesh marrow
 raktasrav ke liye pattee baandhane, apchi ke liye vedhan chhedan aadi upachaaron kaa ullekh miltaa he
 During the time of Lord Buddha, there is a description of successfully performing major surgery and abdominal surgery by a doctor named Jeevak
 shalyakriya se sambandhit anya prasang he- dadhichi ke sir ko hataakar uski jagah ghode ke sir kaa pratyaropan or phir use hataakar asli sir laga dena, rijrashwad kii andhi aankhon main roshni pradaan karnaa, yajna ke kate sir ko punah sandhaan karnaa, shrav kaa kusht rog dur kar use dirdhayu pradaan karnaa, kakshivan ko punah yuvak bananaa, vruddh chyavan ko punah yauvan dena, vamdev ko mata ke garbh se nikaalnaa aadi
 Dhanvantari, a disciple of Indra, laid the foundation of a well-organized and classically Ayurvedic surgery
 dhanvantari ke shishy sushrut ne is shaastra ko sarvangopang viksit kar vyavharopayogi swaroop diya
 Even at that time the surgical field was a general physiologic surgery and subclinical diseases and surgery were considered separately in a branch called Shalakya of Ashtangaayurveda

 Taking this knowledge as the basis, modern surgery is reaching a climax today
 abul kasim jaharaavi kaa prasiddh granth, attasarif, europe main shalyatantr kii unnati kii aadharbhoot neenv he
 The main reason for the amazing progress of modern surgery is the accessibility of good anesthetic and anesthetic drugs and reliable blood vessels, antitussive and antibiotic substances, which were not available in the old times

 Each of the jaggers requires two or more pilots to control them, all of these machines being operated by a link attached to their brain system, a process known as "drifting"; They can be operated by machines only through mental activities
 is kaam ko ekasmaan sahabhaagi jode hi anjaam de sakate hai, jahaan unki yah sukshma maansik pattern is "drifting" ko unke liye aasaan bana detii he
 In 2020, Chatterdome's CO Marshal Stacker Pentecast machine jagger sends Gypsy Danger, two pilots brothers Raliff and Yancey Beckett, to rescue Kaiju from infiltrating the Alaska coast
 unke is ladaai main bhidane dauraan hi, baket bhaiyon kii najar bandargah kii ore lautate ek choti machuaari nauka par jaati he
 Disregarding the orders of his given reports, Ralif threatens the Kaizu named Codename Knifehead, saving the ship
 halaaki, nifahed khud ko is shuruuaati hamale se bachaa letaa he or gypsy danger ko lagbhag andhaa karte hue, uske patavaar ko kholkar usamen maujuud yency ko maar daalata he
 Despite this, Ralif takes over as the lone operator and kills Kaiju and arrives ashore with the same faltering machine, where both father and son undergo his medical treatment
 apane bhai yency ko khone ke aghat se, raliff vah jager program chhod detaa he
 In 2025, the Jaeger program has been canceled, the Kaiju are wasting more in their numbers and strength than they are spending in making Jaegers
 vaishvik netaaon yah nirnay lete hue "anti-kiju" kii tamir par "waal of life" naamak tatavarti diwaar kaa vyapak paimaane par nirmaan kaary kiya jaataa he
 And then at the same construction site, Pentecost meets Beckett, a hard-worker, and asks him about his desire to join the Jaeger program again
 abhi unki baatcheet chal hi rahi hoti he, ki samachar brodcast par australia ke sidney kii tateey diwaar dhwast hone kii haalia tasviren dikhaai jaati hai, jise striker ureka naam ke jager ne abhi-abhi giraaya he
 On Chatterdome, Ralif and Pentecost are welcomed by the Jager Renewal Project's director, Maco Mori
 phir vah un dalon se bhent karaati hai jinke teen jagers: kramshah striker ureka, pehla or ekmaatr mark-5 jager, jiske chaalak baap-bete hai harculis or chak hansen; phir "cherno alpha", sabase purana jagers abbhi jang ke liye sakriy tha, paintecast ke mutabik mark-1 ek behad croor ladaaku jangi mashin he, jiske chaalak sasha evam alexis kaidanovski naam ke danpati chalaate hai, phir "crimson typhun" naamak mark-4 jager jiskaa sanchaalan teen arms par nirbhar he, jise taing vei ke teen tikdi - cheyung, hu or jin sanchalit karte he or chauthaa jager, raliff ke liye tha, gypsy danger kaa dubaara punarnirmaan tathaa, is navinikaran main use atirikt hathiyaaron or ek aanvik riector kor se las kiya jaataa he
 While Raliff needed a co-driver by then, he expects the same base staff to run
 vahiin paintecast kii dattak beti, maco mori, jisaki raliff kii acchhee saajhedaari thi usamen ek kushal payalat kii sambhaavna dekhtaa he, vah paintecast se use ek baar drift karte dekhne kii guzarish karata he
 But in Gypsy Danger's first practice ride, Maco wanders into his childhood memories when Kaizu's attack on Tokyo catapults him, and he is immediately shut down by a technician discharging Jaeger's weapons
 is sambhavit haadase se maco ko paintecast se kaaphi sharminda hona padataa he, raliff dubaara bagaiyr sah-chaalak ke chhut jaataa he
 At the same time, Pentecost then consults with the Kaiju expert and scientist Newton Giszler and Hermann Gatlieb
 aisa vishwaas he ki vah viched darasal sthir ho rahaa hai, jahaan pehle kii hi tarah ek vakt se or zyada kiju ko ugalva sake
 Meanwhile, scientist Newton Giszler creates a device that can help drift through pieces of Kaiju's brain
 vah yah bhi khoj nikaalte hai ki kiju darasal ek jaivik hathiyaar he jise apana agua banaakar koi alokik pargrahi is grah ke maanvon kaa safaya kar, prithvi par kabja karnaa chahta he
 He makes Pentecost aware of the real purpose of these kaiju: in fact the pioneers who came before them failed to settle down due to the high amount of oxygen circulating on the earth, but after being idle for a long time, the increasing pollution on the earth, global The atmosphere is now adapting to them due to warming, acid rain, ozone depletion, and climate change
 paintecast tab newton ko honkong jaakar, kiju ke gorakh khariddaar hanibelle chau ko khojane kehete hai, jisase kiju ke dimag ko hasil kar unase judi jaankaree or maaloom kii jaae
 During the drift, Newton realizes that this brain of Kaiju also works with his consciousness
 jiske anjaam se, do kiju, kodenem otaichi or ledarbaque shahar main ghus kar, ekasaath tabaahi machaate guzarate jate hai, jaisaa ki gatilib ne bhavishyavaanee karai thi
 To save Hong Kong, Crimson Typhoon, Cherno Alpha and striker Yureka are sent to kill Kaiju
 lekin pehle do jagers tabah ho jate hai jisamen striker iempi balast kar ledarbaque ko jad karne ke pher main khud sthir pad jaataa he
 With no choice left, Pentecost sends Ralif and Maco to operate the Gypsy Danger on their permission, and they are also successful in killing Kaiju
 newton or hanibelle udhar otaichi ke shav ko lekar jaldbaaji main rahete hai jinke mutabik iskaa mastishk tabah ho chukaa tha or philhal yah garbhvatee he
 Only then would he swallow Hannibal by waking the newborn Kaiju, but was killed when he stopped breathing, getting entangled in his own umbilical cord
 newton or herman gatilib milakar shishu kiju ke mastishk kii drifting karaate he, or unako pataa chalata he ki vah viched sirf kiju ke diene kii maujuudagi se hi khulegaa, paintecast ab ise band karne kaa ek khatarnaak yojana banaate hai
 But the case worsens when Gatlieb in his prophecy mentions the birth of three more kaiju when stabilized by that breakup
 usase purv hi jagers kii sainya nikaay, do mashiinon ko kam kara detii, chunki majboot naa hone kii vajah se ve uskaa jokhim nahin le paayenge, kiju ko kisi bhi tarah nirast karnaa hoga yadi maanavjaati vilupt hone se khud ko bachaana chaahati ho to
 Pentecost now intends to have an audacious campaign to close that break by molecular weapons
 lekin harculis hensen kii pichhali bhidant main ghayal hone par, paintecast, jager payalat ke shuruaati jang samay dauraan radiation ke vifaille prabhaav se rogagrast hone par bhi, vah chak hensen ke saath striker ureka par sah-payalat banane ko taiyaar hota he; vahiin raliff or maco ko gypsy danger ke sanchaalan ke liye muhaiyaa karaate hai
 All Jaegers encounter three previously mentioned kaiju, one of which remains a highly distorted "slattern" of the fifth category, the largest ever recorded
 donon jagers ko is ladaai main baari kshati pahunchati hai
 Distraught that there is no chance of escape, Pentecost and Chuck decide to detonate the bomb and the two of them are killed
 raliff or maco milakar haraate hue jakhmi slatern ko maar daalate hai, par unki oxigen aapurti nasht ho jaati he
 Ralif then ejects Maco, along with that oxygen system and life-saving pod
 tatpashchaat, slatern ke shav ko hilaate hue, vah gypsy danger ko drive karte hue us pargrahi aayam ke viched se guzar jaataa he
 Whereupon, he manually closes the break-up, uncontrollably maneuvering Jager's nuclear plant
 maco prashanth mahaasaagar kii sataha par akeli rah jaati he, lekin raliff ko dekh use raahat pahunchati he jab gypsy danger ke dhamaake se pehle hi vah pad dwaara baahar batch nil gaya
 And as the rescue helicopters arrive, they embrace the joy of this victory

 vocs play an important role in communication between plants, and send messages from plants to organisms
 kuch vocs maanav swasthya ke liye khatarnaak hote hai va vaataavaran ko haani pahunchaate hai
 Anthropogenic vocs are regulated by law, especially indoors, where concentrations are the highest
 Harmful vocs are typically not acutely toxic, but have compounding long-term health effects
 Because the concentrations are usually low and the symptoms slow to develop, research into vocs and their effects is difficult
 Diverse definitions of the term VOC are in use
 The definitions of vocs used for control of precursors of photochemical smog used by the EPA, and states in the US with independent outdoor air pollution regulations include exemptions for vocs that are determined to be non-reactive, or of low-reactivity in the smog formation process
 EPA formerly defined these compounds as reactive organic gases but changed the terminology to VOC
 In the USA, different regulations vary between states - most prominent is the VOC regulation by SCAQMD and by the California Air Resources Board
 However, this specific use of the term vocs can be misleading, especially when applied to indoor air quality because many chemicals that are not regulated as outdoor air pollution can still be important for indoor air pollution
 Health Canada classes vocs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of 50 to 250 ° C
 
 The emphasis is placed on commonly encountered vocs that would have an effect on air quality
 a VOC is any organic compound having an initial boiling point less than or equal to 250 °se
 measured at a standard atmospheric pressure of 101
3 kpa vocs are legally defined in the various laws and codes under which they are regulated
 Other definitions may be found from government agencies investigating or advising about vocs
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates vocs in the air, water, and land
 The Safe Drinking Water Act implementation includes a list labeled "vocs in connection with contaminants that are organic and volatile
" The EPA also publishes testing methods for chemical compounds, some of which refer to vocs
 In addition to drinking water, vocs are regulated in discharges to waters, as hazardous waste, but not in non industrial indoor air
 The United States Department of Labor and its Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulate VOC exposure in the workplace
 Volatile organic compounds that are hazardous material would be regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration while being transported
 Not counting methane, biological sources emit an estimated 1150 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of vocs
 The majority of vocs are produced by plants, the main compound being isoprene
 The remainder are produced by animals, microbes, and fungi, such as molds
 The strong odor emitted by many plants consists of green leaf volatiles, a subset of vocs
 Emissions are affected by a variety of factors, such as temperature, which determines rates of volatilization and growth, and sunlight, which determines rates of biosynthesis
 Emission occurs almost exclusively from the leaves, the stomata in particular
 a major class of vocs is terpenes, such as myrcene
 Providing a sense of scale, a forest 62,000 km2 in area is estimated to emit 3,400,000 kilograms of terpenes on a typical August day during the growing season
 vocs should be a factor in choosing which trees to plant in urban areas
 Induction of genes producing volatile organic compounds, and subsequent increase in volatile terpenes has been achieved in maize using -3-hexen-1-ol and other plant hormones
 Anthropogenic sources emit about 142 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of vocs
 a major source of man-made vocs are coatings, especially paints and protective coatings
 Solvents are required to spread a protective or decorative film
 Approximately 12 billion litres of paints are produced annually
 Typical solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, ethyl acetate, glycol ethers, and acetone
 Motivated by cost, environmental concerns, and regulation, the paint and coating industries are increasingly shifting toward aqueous solvents
 Chlorofluorocarbons, which are banned or highly regulated, were widely used cleaning products and refrigerants
 Tetrachloroethene is used widely in dry cleaning and by industry
 The use of fossil fuels produces vocs either directly as products or indirectly as byproducts 
 One VOC that is a known human carcinogen is benzene, which is a chemical found in environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels, and exhaust from cars
 Benzene also has natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires
 It is frequently used to make other chemicals in the production of plastics, resins, and synthetic fibers
 Benzene evaporates into the air quickly and the vapor of benzene is heavier than air allowing the compound to sink into low-lying areas
 Benzene has also been known to contaminate food and water and if digested can lead to vomiting, dizziness, sleepiness, rapid heartbeat, and at high levels, even death may occur
 Methylene chloride is another VOC that is highly dangerous to human health
 It can be found in adhesive removers and aerosol spray paints and the chemical has been proven to cause cancer in animals
 In the human body, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide and a person will suffer the same symptoms as exposure to carbon monoxide
 If a product that contains methylene chloride needs to be used the best way to protect human health is to use the product outdoors
 If it must be used indoors, proper ventilation is essential to keeping exposure levels down
 Perchloroethylene is a volatile organic compound that has been linked to causing cancer in animals
 It is also suspected to cause many of the breathing related symptoms of exposure to vocs
 Perchloroethylene is used mostly in dry cleaning
 While dry cleaners recapture perchloroethylene in the dry cleaning process to reuse it, some environmental release is unavoidable
 Studies show that people breathe in low levels of this VOC in homes where dry-cleaned clothes are stored and while wearing dry-cleaned clothing
 MTBE was banned in the US around 2004 in order to limit further contamination of drinking water aquifers primarily from leaking underground gasoline storage tanks where MTBE was used as an octane booster and oxygenated-additive
 Since many people spend much of their time indoors, long-term exposure to vocs in the indoor environment can contribute to sick building syndrome
 In offices, VOC results from new furnishings, wall coverings, and office equipment such as photocopy machines, which can off-gas vocs into the air
 Good ventilation and air-conditioning systems are helpful at reducing vocs in the indoor environment
 Studies also show that relative leukemia and lymphoma can increase through prolonged exposure of vocs in the indoor environment
 In the United States, there are two standardized methods for measuring vocs, one by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and another by Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
 Each method uses a single component solvent; butanol and hexane cannot be sampled, however, on the same sample matrix using the NIOSH or OSHA method
 The aromatic VOC compound benzene, emitted from exhaled cigarette smoke is labeled as carcinogenic, and is ten times higher in smokers than in nonsmokers
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency has found concentrations of vocs in indoor air to be 2 to 5 times greater than in outdoor air and sometimes far greater
 During certain activities indoor levels of vocs may reach 1,000 times that of the outside air
 Studies have shown that individual VOC emissions by themselves are not that high in an indoor environment, but the indoor total VOC concentrations can be up to five times higher than the VOC outdoor levels
 New buildings especially, contribute to the highest level of VOC off-gassing in an indoor environment because of the abundant new materials generating VOC particles at the same time in such a short time period
 In addition to new buildings, we also use many consumer products that emit VOC compounds, therefore the total concentration of VOC levels is much greater within the indoor environment
 VOC concentration in an indoor environment during winter is three to four times higher than the VOC concentrations during the summer
 High indoor VOC levels are attributed to the low rates of air exchange between the indoor and outdoor environment as a result of tight-shut windows and the increasing use of humidifiers
 In most countries, a separate definition of vocs is used with regard to indoor air quality that comprises each organic chemical compound that can be measured as follows: Adsorption from air on Tenax TA, thermal desorption, gas chromatographic separation over a 100% nonpolar column 
 VOC are all compounds that appear in the gas chromatogram between and including n-hexane and n-hexadecane
 Compounds appearing earlier are called VVOC compounds appearing later are called SVOC 
 See also these standards: ISO 16000-6, ISO 13999-2, VDI 4300-6, German agbb evaluating scheme, German dibt approval scheme, GEV testing method for the emicode
some overviews over VOC emissions rating schemes have been collected and compared
 France, Germany and Belgium have enacted regulations to limit VOC emissions from commercial products, and industry has developed numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems, such as EMICODE, M1, Blue Angel and Indoor Air Comfort in the United States, several standards exist; California Standard CDPH Section 01350 is the most popular one
 Over the last few decades, these regulations and standards changed the marketplace, leading to an increasing number of low-emitting products: the leading voluntary labels report that licenses to several hundreds of low-emitting products have been issued
 Many building materials such as paints, adhesives, wall boards, and ceiling tiles slowly emit formaldehyde, which irritates the mucous membranes and can make a person irritated and uncomfortable
 Formaldehyde emissions from wood are in the range of 0
02 – 0
04 ppm
 Relative humidity within an indoor environment can also affect the emissions of formaldehyde
 High relative humidity and high temperatures allow more vaporization of formaldehyde from wood-materials
 Respiratory, allergic, or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made vocs and other indoor or outdoor air pollutants
 Some vocs, such as styrene and limonene, can react with nitrogen oxides or with ozone to produce new oxidation products and secondary aerosols, which can cause sensory irritation symptoms
 Unspecified vocs are important in the creation of smog
 Health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea; damage to liver, kidney, and central nervous system
 Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans
 Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to vocs include conjunctival irritation, nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, dyspnea, declines in serum cholinesterase levels, nausea, vomiting, nose bleeding, fatigue, dizziness
 The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effects
 As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed
 Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics
 At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes
 Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans
 To reduce exposure to these toxins, one should buy products that contain low-vocs or no vocs
 Only the quantity which will soon be needed should be purchased, eliminating stockpiling of these chemicals
 Use products with vocs in well ventilated areas
 When designing homes and buildings, design teams can implement the best possible ventilation plans, call for the best mechanical systems available, and design assemblies to reduce the amount of infiltration into the building
 These methods will help improve indoor air quality, but by themselves they cannot keep a building from becoming an unhealthy place to breathe
 Limit values for VOC emissions into indoor air are published by e
g
 agbb, AFSSET, California Department of Public Health, and others
 These regulations have prompted several companies to adapt with VOC level reductions in products that have vocs in their formula, such Benjamin Moore & Co
 in the paint industry and weld-on in the adhesive industry
 The exhaled human breath contains a few hundred volatile organic compounds and is used in breath analysis to serve as a VOC biomarker to test for diseases such as lung cancer
 One study has shown that "volatile organic compounds 


 are mainly blood borne and therefore enable monitoring of different processes in the body
" And it appears that VOC compounds in the body "may be either produced by metabolic processes or inhaled / absorbed from exogenous sources" such as environmental tobacco smoke
 Research is still in the process to determine whether vocs in the body are contributed by cellular processes or by the cancerous tumors in the lung or other organs
 vocs in the environment or certain atmospheres can be detected based on different principles and interactions between the organic compounds and the sensor components
 There are electronic devices that can detect ppm concentrations despite the non-selectivity
 Others can predict with reasonable accuracy the molecular structure of the volatile organic compounds in the environment or enclosed atmospheres and could be used as accurate monitors of the Chemical Fingerprint and further as health monitoring devices
 Solid-phase microextraction techniques are used to collect vocs at low concentrations for analysis
 Direct injection mass spectrometry techniques are frequently utilized for the rapid detection and accurate quantification of vocs
 PTR-MS is among the methods that have been used most extensively for the on-line analysis of biogenic and antropogenic vocs
 Recent PTR-MS instruments based on time-of-flight mass spectrometry have been reported to reach detection limits of 20 pptv after 100 ms and 750 ppqv after 1 min measurement time
 The mass resolution of these devices is between 7000 and 10,500 m / Δm, thus it is possible to separate most common isobaric vocs and quantify them independently

 Pangea, Pangea or Pangea, was a vast unified continent that existed during the Paleozoic and Mizozoic eras around 250 million years ago; The present continent has come out of this in its present form
 yah naam alfred vegener ke mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kii vaigyanik charchaa main gadha gaya tha
 In his book, "the Origin of Continents and Oceans", he considered that all continents were part of a vast continent at one time, which he called "the continent", before subsequently disintegrating and flowing to their present places

 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean
 proto-loresia ke swayan vibhajit hokar alag-alag hone ke turant baad laurenshia, siberia or baltic mahadwipon kaa nirmaan hua
 Its rift also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and the Paleocean Ocean
 baltic laurenshia ke purv main or siberia laurenshia ke uttar-purv main sthit tha
 Around 600 ma, most of these oceans came back together to form Panotia, a relatively short giant continent consisting of a large amount of land near the poles and just a relatively small strip connecting the polar oceans near the equator
 isaki utpatti ke keval 60 million varsh ke baad, lagbhag 540 eme, cambrian yug kii shuruyaat ke kareeb panotia phir se vikhandit ho gaya jisase laurenshia, baltic or gondvanaa ke dakshini vishaal mahadweep kaa janm hua
 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
 baltic, laurenshia or evalonia sabhi ordovisian kaal ke ant tak ek saath mil gaye or is tarah ipitas mahaasaagar ke nikat ek chote mahadweep kaa nirmaan hua jise uramerica yaa loresia kaha gaya
 The North Appalachians also originated as a result of the collision
 Siberia is located near Euramerica with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents

 Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, and a remnant of the Ipitus Ocean, a sea route between them, was still shrinking as Avalonia slowly slid towards Laurentia
 is bich dakshini europe gondvanaa se khandit ho gaya or navgathit rek mahaasaagar ke paar uramerica kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or devonian main dakshini baltic se takaraa gaya, haalanki yah chota mahadweep pani ke neeche kii ek pattee ke rup main tha
 The Khanty Ocean, a branch of the Ipitus Ocean, was also shrinking from Siberia as an island island that collided with the eastern Baltic
 is dweepiya vrutt ke peeche ek nayaa sagar, ural mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Towards the end of the Silurian period North and South China moved away from Gondwana and began to move northward across the shrinking proto-tethys Ocean, with the new paleo-tethys Ocean opening at its southern tip

 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction

 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa

 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock

 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava

 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the
 India continued northward towards Eurasia at a speed of 15 cm per year and closed the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stayed there and settled in the African Plate
 newjiland, new calladonia or jeelandia kaa shesh bhaag australia se alag hone laga tha or prashanth kii disha main purv kii ore bad rahaa tha or isane coral sagar or tasman sagar kaa rasta khol diya tha
 The third important and final phase of the fragmentation of Pangea was completed in the early Sinozoic era
 loresia us samay alag hua jab uttar america / greenland uresia se mukt ho gaya or lagbhag 60-55 eme main isane norway ke sagar kaa maarg khol diya
 atlantic or hind mahaasaagar kaa vistaar hona jari rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa maarg band ho gaya
 Meanwhile Australia split from the Antarctic and moved rapidly northward, just as India did more than 40 million years ago and is currently in a collision situation with East Asia
 australia or bharat donon is samay prati varsh 5-6 centimetre kii gati se purvottar disha main bad rahe hai
 The Antarctic has been in or near the South Pole since the origin of Pangea in about 280 MA
 bharat takreeban 35 eme kii shuruyaat main asia se takaraane laga tha jisase himalay kii orogeni kaa nirmaan hua or tethis kaa samudri maarg bhi antat band ho gaya; yah takkar aaj bhi jari he
 The African plate began to change its directions from west to northwest toward Europe and South America began to move northward, separating it from Antarctica and for the first time the entire ocean circulation around the Antarctic
 , Due to which the continent began to cool down rapidly and glaciers were formed
 Other significant events during the Sinozoic era included the opening of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Alps, and the formation of the Japanese sea

 After independence from Spain, the city became part of Mexico in 1821 and after the end of the Mexican American War in 1848, it was bought by the United States under a treaty between the United States and Mexico

 The first European to arrive here was Huan Rodrigues Cabrillo, a Portuguese investigative sailor arriving in 1542, who declared it a city of gods for the Kingdom of Spain
 ; halaaki usne yahaan koi basti nahin basaai
 After that, the contact with the outside world came for the second time after 227 years when two Christian missionaries from France named Gaspar de Portla, and Hwan Crespi arrived here on 2 August 1769

 The topography of Las Angeles is quite heterogeneous, with a total area of about 498
3 sq
 M, consisting of 469
1 sq
 m of land and 29
2 sq
 m of water
 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 On the Hooghly River, the path of National Highway-2, the need to construct a new bridge, the age of Vivekananda Setu and the additional traffic had to be weakened

 The total cost of construction of this bridge was 650 crores

 The special requirement of the design of this bridge was to make this bridge deliberately small in size and grand to work, so that it does not spoil the view of the old Vivekananda Setu, nor its grandeur, the grandeur and beauty of the historic Dakshineswar Kali temple Reduce, and yet be so strong, that the high speed can easily carry the load of 6 lanes of heavy carriages

 This cable and girder together make this bridge a very strong bridge using work building materials with medium size and work height as per its requirement, which has much greater carrying capacity
