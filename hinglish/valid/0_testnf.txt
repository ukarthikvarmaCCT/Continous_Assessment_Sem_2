 The International Energy Agency states that: First-generation technologies emerged from the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century and include hydropower, biomass combustion, and geothermal power and heat
 Some of these technologies are still in widespread use
 Second-generation technologies include solar heating and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics
 These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration investments since the 1980s
 The initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the continuing appeal of these renewables is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits
 Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials
 Third-generation technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification, biorefinery technologies, concentrating solar thermal power, hot dry rock geothermal energy, and ocean energy
 Advances in nanotechnology may also play a major role
 First and second generation technology has entered the market and third generation technology is entirely dependent on long-term research and development commitments where the public sector has to play its role

 If energy use increases rapidly, then renewable energy development will pursue a decreasing target
 Similarly, if clean energy is increased rapidly on the supply path, it will reduce total emissions by decreasing the increase in demand, which will inevitably result in a decrease in the amount of carbon from energy sources
 Commitment to both renewable energy and competence is essential for a serious vision about the renewable energy economy

 When energy is purchased from the electricity network, the energy that reaches the consumer is not necessarily constructed from a green energy source
 Electricity purchased through local consumer company, power company, or state power intermediation, which is purchased from power producers, may be manufactured from biofuels or from nuclear or renewable energy sources

 Transferring this energy from the existing infrastructure to the demanding areas like urban centers will be an extremely inefficient and difficult task
 In addition, only 20 percent will remain eligible for inclusion in the grid, regardless of the amount of renewable energy produced or the economic feasibility of such technologies
 To achieve more sustainable energy, it is imperative for the United States to implement a plan to improve the power grid, which will result in adjusted fuel economy
 haalanki, in vitaran samasyaon ko dur karne kii pahal ke liye kai prastaav die ja rahe hai

 This system will increase efficiency by reducing the amount of energy lost in transmission
 It will also be economically viable as the quantity of power lines being built will be reduced keeping in mind the demand
 In this system additional benefits and assistance will be earned by combining heat and power and will help to increase the capacity by about 80-90%
 This is a significant increase, which is currently significantly higher than the 34% received from fossil fuel plants

 akshay / navikarniya urja ke vidyut sanyantr urja kaa nirantar pravaah pradaan karte hai
 For example- hydroelectric plants, ocean thermal plants, osmotic power plants all provide power at a regulated speed and at any moment they are available as such a power source
 But at present, there are very few number of steady flow renewable / renewable power plants which cannot meet the energy demand at the time of day when the renewable energy plants producing unregulated power are unable to produce power

 It is said that nuclear nuclei have the capability of indestructibility, such as the use of breeder reactors
 However, it is often argued that it is imperative to deal with serious challenges before a significant increase in its role

 muktak kavy yaa kavita kaa vah prakaar he jisamen prabandhakiyata na ho
 In this, the said matter in one verse does not have any relation or relevance to what is said in the other verse
 kabir evam rahim ke dohe; mirabai ke padya aadi sab muktak rachanaaen hai
 Most of the Muktak Kavyas were composed in the Hindi language
 muktak shabd kaa arth he ‘apane aap main sampoorn’ athwa ‘anya nirpeksh vastu’ hona
 at: muktak kavy kii vah vidha he jisamen katha kaa koi purvapar sambandh nahin hota
 prayek chand apane aap main purnat: swatantra or sampoorn arth dene vaala hota he
 In the Sanskrit poetry tradition, the word Muktak was first introduced by Anandvardhan
 It cannot be assumed that no one had knowledge of this direction of poetry before
 Acharya Dandi was acquainted with the name Muktak not as a right but an undefined poem
 Defining Muktak in 'agnipuran' said that: ”muktakan shloke evaikshchamatkaaraksham: satam” That is, the only one who has the ability to perform miracles is called Muktak
 Rajashekhar has also discussed the name Muktak
 Giving importance to Rasa, Anandvardhan said in relation to Muktak: ”tatra muktakeshu rasabandhabhiniveshin: kave: tadashrayamauchityam” That is, the abhinivesh or prestige of the rasa in Muktakas is the administrator of his bond and it is justified by the poet to take shelter of the same
 hemachandracharya ne muktak shabd ke sthaan par muktkaadi shabd kaa prayog kiya
 unhone uskaa lakshan dandi kii parampara main dete hue kaha ki jo anibaddh hon, ve muktadi hai
 In the modern era, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla of Hindi considered Muktak
 According to him: muktak main prabandh ke samaan ras kii dhara nahin rahati, jisamen katha-prasang kii paristhiti main apane ko bhuulaa hua pathak magn ho jaataa he or hriday main ek sthaayee prabhaav grahan karata he
 isamen to ras ke aise chhinte padate hai, jinamein hriday-kalika thodi der ke liye khil uthati he
 yadi prabandh ek vistrut vanasthali he, to muktak ek chunaa hua guladasta he
 isi se yah samaajon ke liye adhik upyukt hota he
 isamen uttarottar drishyon dwaara sangathit purna jivan yaa uske kisi purna ang kaa pradarshan nahin hota, balki ek romantic khand-drishy is prakaar sahasaa saamne laa diya jaataa he ki pathak yaa shrota kuch kshanon ke liye mantrmugdh sa ho jaataa he
 iske liye kavi ko manoram vastuon or vyapaaron kaa ek chota stavak kalpit karke unhen atyant sankshipt or shashakt bhashaa main pradarshit karnaa padataa he
 Acharya Shukla had said that the free power of language and the power of imagination was necessary for Muktak elsewhere
 Impressed by that, Govind Trigunayat presented the following definition: meri samaj main muktak us rachana ko kehete hai jisamen prabandhatv kaa abhaav hote hue bhi kavi apni kalpana kii samaahaar shakti or bhashaa kii samaaj shakti ke sahare kisi ek romantic drishy, paristhiti, ghatana yaa vastu kaa aisa chitratmak evam bhavpurn varnan prastut karata he, jisase pathakon ko prabandh jaisaa anand aane lagata he
 Actually this definition is flawed
 It is not appropriate to say enjoyment like management
 In such a situation, the following definition of Muktak is also given: muktak kavy kii vah vidha he jisamen katha kaa purvapar sambandh na hote hue bhi twarit gati se saadhaaraneekaran karne kii kshamta hoti he
 In my view, the definition of Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is sufficient
 Ultimately, it can be called a chosen bouquet

 Laurence Kolberg has six stages of moral development that are easily recognizable
 in chah charnon main se prayek charan naitik dubidhaon ko suladhane main apane purv charan se adhik paripurna he
 Like Piaget, Kolberg also found that moral development takes place at certain stages
 colberg ne paaya ki ye charan saarvbhaumik hote hai
 Kolberg arrived at these decisions after using a special type of interview with children for twenty years
 in saakshatkaaron main bacchon ko kuch aisi kahaniyaan sunai gayi jinamein kahaniyon ke paatro ke saamne kai naitik ulajhane thim
 The most popular dilemma is - yah kahani un gyaarah kahaniyon main se ek he, jo colberg ne naitik vikaas ko jaanane ke liye istemaal kii thim
 After reading this story, the children who were interviewed had to answer some questions on the moral dilemma
 saakshaatkaar dwaara die gaye uttaron ke aadhaar par colberg ne naitik chintan kii teen avasthaaen bataai hai, jinhen punah do-do charnon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 This is the lowest stage of moral thinking
 is charan main kya sahi or galat he, par baahar se milane vaali sajaa or uphaar kaa prabhaav padataa he
 Step 1: Based on external power charan 2 : vyakti kendrit, ek duusare kaa hit saadhane par aadhaarit naitik chintan - yah roodhi purv avasthaa kaa doosraa charan he
 Here the child thinks that there is nothing wrong in acting according to his interests, but together we should also give others a chance to work according to their interests
 atah is str kii naitik soch yah kahati he ki vahi baat sahi he jisamen barabari kaa len-dein ho rahaa ho
 If we fulfill any other wish, then they too will fulfill our wish
 yah colberg ke naitik vikaas ke siddhanton kii duusari avasthaa he
 In this state, people look at things with a preconceived view
 jaise dekha gaya he ki aksar bacchon kaa vyavhaar unke maa-baap yaa kisi bade vyakti dwaara banaae gaye niyamon par aadhaarit hota he
 Step 3: Ethical Thinking Based on Good Mutual Practices and Relationships - This is the third stage of Kolberg's principles of moral development
 is sthiti main log vishwaas, dusron kaa khyaal rakhana, dusron ke nishpaksh vyavhaar ko apane naitik vyavhaar kaa aadhaar maanate hai
 Children and youth adopt the norms of moral behavior set by their parents that make them a "good boy or good girl" in the eyes of their parents
 charan 4 : saamaajik vyavastha banaae rakhane par aadhaarit naitik chintan - yah colberg ke siddhanton kii chauthi avasthaa he
 In this situation, the state of moral development of the people is based on social order, law, justice and duties like teenagers think that society should remain within the scope created by law in order to do well
 yah colberg ke naitik vikaas ke siddhanton kii paanchavin avasthaa he
 In this situation, alternative routes are discovered and then a way to find one's own personal behavior
 charan 5 : saamaajik anubandh, upyogita or vyaktigat adhikaron par aadhaarit naitik chintan - yah colberg ke siddhant kii paanchavi avasthaa he
 At this stage one starts thinking that some values, principles and rights can be above the law
 vyakti vaastavik saamaajik vyavasthaaon kaa moolyankan is drushti se karne lagata he ki ve kis had tak mul adhikaron va mulyon kaa sangrakshan karte he
 Step 6: Moral Concern Based on Principles of Universal Policy - This is the highest and sixth stage of Kolberg's moral principles
 is avasthaa main vyakti saarvbhaumik maanavadhikaar par aadhaarit naitik maapdand banaata he
 Whenever a person is trapped between the duality of the voice of the soul, that person argues that one should walk with the voice of the soul, even if that decision is risky
 isiilie use kuch bhi karne se pehle apni bhaawanaaon ke alaava auron kii jindagi ke bare main bhi sochna chahie tha
 Kolberg believes that these states and states move in a sequence and are linked to age
 9 saal kii umr se pehle bachche pehle str par kaam karte he
 Most teenagers are found to be thinking in the third stage but they may also show some signs of thinking in the second and fourth stages
 praarambhik vayaskta main pahuchane par kuch thode se log hi rudhipurnataa se upar uthakar naitik tark dete he
 But what evidence is there that attests to the development of this method? According to the results of a 20-year study, the use of stages 1 and 2 has decreased with age, and stage 4, which is not at all in the moral rationale of 10-year-olds, is the moral of 62 percent of people aged 36 years
 Appeared in thought paanchavi avasthaa 20 se 22 saal kii umr tak bilkul bhi nahin aati or vah kabhi bhi 10 pratishat se zyada main nahin dikhaai detii
 That is why the moral states come a little later than what Kolberg initially thought, and thinking in the sixth state comes in very high states, which is very unique
 haalanki avasthaa 6 kohlburg kii naitik nirnaayak ank pranali se hataa di gai he, lekin yah abhi bhi saidhantik rup se colberg kii naitik vikaas kii sankalpana ke liye jaruri maani jaati he
 What are the factors that affect the passing of Kolberg states? However, at every stage, moral reasoning is based on some level of cognitive development
 colberg yah bahes karte hai ki bacchon kaa sangyanatmak vikaas unke naitik chintan ke vikaas ko sunishchit nahin karata he, balki bacchon kii naitik taarkikta yah dikhaati he ki unhen naitik sawaalon or naitik dwandv ko hal karne ke kaise anubhav mili hai
 Kolberg believed that children's interaction was one of the most important social stimuli that could provide a challenge for children to change their moral thinking
 jabaki vayask niyam or kaayade bacchon par thopate hai, bacchon main aapasi len-dein unako duusare vyakti kaa drushtikon dekhne or janatantric dhang se niyam banane kaa avasar pradaan karata hai
 Kolberg states that children's ability to take the point of view of others brings progress in their moral reasoning
 colberg ke naitikta ke siddhanton kii aalochana nimnlikhit binduon par kii gai haih- According to Kolberg's critics, all attention to Kolberg's moral principles is limited to moral thinking and there is not much talk about moral behavior
 unka kahana he ki naitik vyavhaar par baat karnaa utana hi jaruri he jitna naitik soch par baat karnaa kyonki kai baar log dikhaate hai ki unki soch kaaphi naitik he parantu unka vyavhaar uske vipareet hota he
 It is not necessary that people who claim to think should also behave ethically
 isiilie naitik soch or naitik vyavhaar donon kaa adhyayan karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 Like leaders make many ethical claims but their behavior is often immoral and contrary to their claims
 iske alaava naitikta kii samaj hote hue bhi log aniatik kaary karte hai
 Just like the thieves know that stealing is the wrong thing, but still they steal
 duusari ore baindoora kaa kahana he ki kaaphi log apane aniatik vyavhaar ko naitik uddeshyon se apni or samaaj kii najaron main sahi siddh karne kii koshish karte hai jaise jehad ke naam par kiye jane vaale hamale or garbhpaat virdohi kaaryakarta jo bachche giraakar garbhpaat karne vaale aspataal nasht karte hai or doctoron kaa khun karte he
 Critics believe that Kolberg's theories should focus on the evaluation of morality
 unka maananaa he ki jo kahani colberg naitik tarkon kaa moolyankan karne ke liye istemaal karte hai unke aadhaar par moolyankan karnaa kaaphi mushkil hota he
 Furthermore, the dilemmas that Kolberg presents are quite different from the dilemmas encountered in real life to evaluate moral arguments
 colberg ke anusaar uski naitik tarkon kii avasthaaen saarvbhaumik he parantu kuch aalochakon ke anusaar uske siddhant saanskrithik rup se pakshpaati he
 But both Kolberg and his critics are somewhat right
 27 samskritiyon main kiye gaye 45 adhyayanon main colberg ke siddhanton kii pehali chaar avasthaaen saarvbhaumik pai gayi
 But the fifth and sixth stages have not been found in all cultures, and it has also been found that Kolberg's assessment system does not contain the high moral reasoning found in other cultures and that moral thinking depends on a particular culture more than Kolberg thought
 Does
 bharat main har jeev kii pavitrataa or jeev sansar kii ekta kaa naitik chintan, israel main samudaay kii samta or samuhik sukh ke chintan par aadhaarit naitikta or neugini main samuhik naitik daayitv kii soch jaise vichaaron ko colberg ke naitik tarkon kii avasthaaon main ucch sthaan par nahin rakhaa jayega kyonki unamem anya vichaaron kii tulana main nyaay ke vichaar ko zyada tavajjo di gai he
 Despite that Kolberg's principles fit many cultures, but they do not include the moral concepts of some cultures
 colberg kaa maananaa he ki paariwarik prakriyaayein bacchon ke naitik vikaas ke liye kuch khaas jaruri nahin he
 He says that the relationship between children and parents gives children very few opportunities to seek each other's opinion
 balki bacchon ko naitik vikaas ke zyada avasar apane doston ke saath milte hai
 Evolutionary individuals believe that active discipline with friends, using logic and taking children's attention to the outcome of the work they do, also leads to moral development
 iske alaava mata-pita ke khud ke naitik mulya bhi bacchon ke naitik vikaas main sahaayta karte hai
 Kolberg's theory is based on gender differences, as criticized by Carroll Gilligan
 giligan kaa kahana he ki kohlburg ke siddhant purush rivaajon par aadhaarit hai jo ki siddhanton ko aapasi sambandhon se upar rakhte hai
 They believe that individuals make their moral decisions independently
 colberg ke drushtikon main naitikta nyaay par aadhaarit he parantu giligan kaa maananaa he ki colberg ne apane naitik siddhanton main dekhbhaal ke drushtikon ko shaamil nahin kiya he
 They have not given any place in their morality to mutual relations, feelings of concern to others, feelings of connectedness to each other
 giligan ke anusaar aisa isliye hua kyonki colberg khud purush hai or unke siddhant purushon par kiye gaye shodh va unke javaabon par aadhaarit he
 Whereas Gilligan studied the responses of girls between 6 and 18 years of age, he saw that girls were judged by a moral dilemma based on human relationships
 parantu kuch adhyayan ne naitik nirnay main ling bhed ke hone par shankaa jataai he
 According to him, this distinction in moral judgment is very less and both men and women solve the dilemmas of mutual relation from the point of view of care and social dilemmas from the judicial point of view

 Bhil to Rahman to teen thapad diya Dividend is the share of partners in a company's profit that it pays to its shareholders when the company makes a profit
 kisi joint stock company main labhaansh, sheyaron ke nishchit mulya ke aadhaar par miltaa he
 In this case the shareholder assumes dividend in proportion to his share
 dividend paise, share yaa anya kai roopon main diya ja saktaa he
 The portion of profit which is divided among the shareholders of a trading company is called dividend
 prayek vyapaarik company ko labhaansh vitaran karne kaa samavayi adhikaar hota he
 Operators recommend how much amount to be declared as dividend
 uske pashchaat company apni saamaanya baithak main labhaansh kii ghoshnaa karti he, kintu yah raashi sanchaalkon dwaara sifarish kii gai raashi se adhik nahin honi chahie
 In addition, the operators can also declare an interim dividend in between two general meetings, if authorized by the Articles
 yat: labhaansh company ke laabh kaa hi bhaag hota he, at: ise keval laabh se hi diya ja saktaa he, na ki poonji se
 The general rights of shareholders, such as the rate of dividend and the prerogative, etc
, are sometimes disclosed in the Seamanium concerning dividends so that those rights cannot be changed as much as possible
 kai baar inkaa prakathan antarniyamon main kiya jaat he or kabhi kabhi donon pralekhon main bhi inkaa prakathan hota he
 The manner in which the declaration and payment of dividend will be made is generally disclosed in the Articles
 jab tak company chaalu rahati he, vah puraa laabh anshadhariyon main vitaran karne ke liye baadhya nahin hoti
 Instead of distributing dividends, it can convert its profit into capital if it is arranged in the articles
 labhaansh ko isaki ghoshnaa ke din se rin mana jaataa he tathaa yah dey ho jaataa he
 Sometimes there is a provision in the Articles that it can be forfeited if the dividend is ineligible for a certain period of time after the announcement
 company se sadsy antarniyamon ke niyamanusaar labhaansh kii adhiyachana kar sakate hai kintu yah aavashyak he ki aise sadasyon kaa naam labhaansh ghoshnaa ke din company ke register main darj ho
 When the transfer of shares is on the date very close to the declaration of dividend, the transferor and the transferor can also contract who gets the dividend
 labhaansh mukhyat: teen prakaar ke hote hai: Cash dividend is paid as a check
 is prakaar arjeet aay par shairdharak ko kar adaa karnaa padataa he
 Take a simple example, if a person has 1000 shares and if his cash dividend value is Rs 1, then he will get Rs 1000 as dividend
 stock dividend main company shairdharak ko milane vaale laabh ke evaj main or share de detii he
 As an example of this dividend, the company will give five additional shares to the company holding 1000 shares, if it has a dividend profit of five percent
 property dividend main labhaansh kamaane ke rup main company shairdharak ko koi sampatti detii he, lekin company praaia: aise dividend yada-kada hi detii he
 It depends entirely on the willingness of the shareholder to keep or sell the shares received as dividend

 jo stock dividend ke rup main ritern detaa he uske prati niveshak kaa bharosa zyada hota he
 The dividend paid to the investor is tax-free
 haalanki yah vyakti-vishesh ke anusaar alag-alag hota he, lekin byaaj par kar lagata he
 This is because interest is considered an expense and dividend is considered an investor benefit
 yadi company apni aay, jisamen labhaansh bhi shaamil hai, par kar adaa kar chuki he, to uske baad labhaansh par kar lene se yah dugana kar ho jayega
 For this reason, the dividend was exempted in 1997
 haal hi main kai companiyon jaise ki dabar, financiel technology, dabar or krampaton greeves aadi or piesu cell, gail, nalko ne apane shairdharakon ke liye kar mukt labhaansh kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Thus dividend is beneficial for tax avoidance
 iske kai kaaran hote hai: In private limited companies, the main shareholders get the benefit of higher dividend, as it saves them more tax

 Prayers also came to be known as "prayers" started in Sanskrit language instead of Marathi
 For senior volunteers, OTC Camps were started where they were also given paramilitary education
 For all these works, the services of a retired military officer Mr
 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis

 nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main nirvaachit sadsy nirarhit hoga yadi vah apane nirvachan ke pashchaat kisi raajnneetik dal main sammilit ho jaataa he
 However, a nominated member of the House by the President will be allowed to join any political party if he / she does so within the first six months of assuming his / her place in the House
 kisi sadsy ko is aadhaar par nirarhit nahin kiya jayega yadi vah rajya sabha kaa up-sabhapati nirvaachit hone ke pashchaat apane raajnneetik dal kii sadsyta swechha se chhod detaa / detii he
 Representatives of States and Union Territories in the Rajya Sabha are elected by indirect electoral system
 prayek rajya tathaa do sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan us rajya kii vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadasyon tathaa us sangh rajya kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal ke sadasyon, jaisaa bhi maamla ho, dwaara ekal sankramntic mat dwaara anupatik pratinidhitiv pranali ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 The electoral college of the Delhi National Capital Region consists of the elected members of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and the Puducherry Union Territory electorate in the Puducherry Legislative Assembly
 rajya sabha ek sthaayee sadan he or yah bhang nahin hota
 However, one-third of the members of Rajya Sabha retire after every two years
 purnakalik avadhi ke liye nirvaachit sadsy chah varshon kii avadhi ke liye kaary karata he
 An election held to fill a vacancy created otherwise than on retirement at the end of the term of a member is called a 'by-election'
 up-chunaav main nirvaachit koi sadsy us sadsy kii shesh karyavadhi tak sadsy bana rah saktaa he jisane tyaagptr de diya tha yaa jisaki mrityu ho gai thi yaa jo dasvin anusuchee ke adheen sabha kaa sadsy hone ke liye nirarhit ho gaya tha
 The Presiding Officers of Rajya Sabha have the responsibility to conduct the proceedings of the House
 bharat ke uparashtrapati rajya sabha ke paden sabhapati hai
 Unlike the members of the Rajya Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha has a tenure of 5 years, the Rajya Sabha also elects a Deputy Chairman from among its members
 rajya sabha main upsabhadhyakshon kaa ek panel bhi hota he, jiske sadasyon kaa namanirdesan sabhapati, rajya sabha dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, a member from the panel of Deputy Speaker presides over the proceedings of the House
 lok sabha ke vipareet rajyasabha kaa sabhapati apana istipha upasabhapati ko nahin balki raashtrapati ko detaa he
 The secretary-general is appointed by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and his rank is equivalent to the highest civil servant of the Union
 mahasachiv gumnaam rah kar kaary karte hai or sansadeey maamalon par salaah dene ke liye tatparta se peethasin adhikariyon ko uplabdh rahete hai
 The secretary-general is also the administrative head of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat and the custodian of the records of the House
 vah rajya sabha ke sabhapati ke nidesh va niyantranaadhin kaary karte hai
 Under Article 75 of the Constitution, the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha which means that the Rajya Sabha cannot form or topple the Government
 tathaapi, yah sarkaar par niyantran rakh sakati he or yah kaary vishesh rup se us samay bahut mahatvapurn ho jaataa he jab sarkaar ko rajya sabha main bahumat praapt nahin hota he
 In the case of a general legislation, to remove the deadlock between the two Houses, the Constitution provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses
 vastut:, ateet main aise teen avasar aae hai jab sansad kii sabhaaon kii unke bich matbhedon ko sulajhane ke liye sanyukt baithak hui thi
 The issues to be raised in the joint meeting are decided by a majority of the total number of members present and voting in both the Houses
 sanyukt baithak sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main yojit kii jaati he jisaki adhyakshata loksabhaadhyaksh dwaara kii jaati he
 However, in the case of a Money Bill, there is no provision in the Constitution to convene a joint sitting of the two Houses, as the Lok Sabha enjoys prominence over the Rajya Sabha in financial matters
 samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke sambandh main, samvidhan main yah upbandh kiya gaya he ki aise vidheyak ko donon sabhaaon dwaara, samvidhan ke anuchhed 368 ke adheen vihit rup main, vishisht bahumat se paarit kiya janaa hota he
 Therefore, there is no provision to remove the deadlock between the two Houses in relation to the Constitution Amendment Bill
 mantri sansad kii kisi bhi sabha se ho sakate hai
 The constitution does not make any distinction between the assemblies in this regard
 prayek mantri ko kisi bhi sabha main bolne or uski kaarywahi main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar hota he, lekin vah usee sabha main mat dene kaa hakdaar hota he jiskaa vah sadsy hota he
 Similarly, with respect to the powers, privileges and immunities of the Houses of Parliament, their members and their committees, the two Houses have been placed on the same level by the Constitution
 jin anya mahatvapurn vishyon ke sambandh main donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai ve is prakaar hai:- raashtrapati kaa nirvachan tathaa mahabhiyog, uparashtrapati kaa nirvachan, apatkaal kii udghoshnaa kaa anumodan, rajyon main sanvaidhanik tantra kii vifaltaa se sambandhit udghoshnaa or vittiya apatkaal
 In connection with receiving reports and letters from various constitutional authorities, etc
, both Houses have equal powers
 is prakaar, yah spasht he ki mantri-parishad kii samuhik jimmedaari ke maamle or kuch aise vittiya maamle, jo sirf lok sabha ke kshetradhikaar main aate hai, ke sivaae donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai
 The Rajya Sabha, being a federal house, has certain powers under the Constitution
 rajyasabha ke paas teen vishesh shaktiyaan hoti he All the subjects / areas related to the legislation are divided into three lists - Union List, State List and Concurrent List
 sangh or rajya suchiyaan paraspar apvarjit hai- koi bhi duusare ke kshetra main rakhe gaye vishay par kanoon nahin bana saktaa
 However, if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, it is "necessary or expedient in the national interest" that the Parliament certify any in the State List If the law is made on the subject, then the Parliament becomes empowered to legislate for the entire territory of India or any part of it on the subject specified in that resolution
 aisa sankalp adhiktam ek varsh kii avadhi ke liye pravrutt rahegaa parantu yah avadhi isi prakaar ke sankalp ko paarit karke ek varsh ke liye pun: badhaayi ja sakati he
 If the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by a majority of at least two-thirds of the members present and voting, declaring that the creation of one or more All India Services for the Union and the States is in the national interest
 If necessary or expedient, Parliament by law becomes empowered to create such services
 samvidhan ke adheen, raashtrapati ko rashtriya apaat kii sthiti main, kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik tantra ke vifal ho jane kii sthiti main athwa vittiya apaat kii sthiti main udghoshnaa jari karne kaa adhikaar he
 It is mandatory for each such proclamation to be approved by both the Houses of Parliament within the stipulated period
 tathaapi, katipay paristhitiyon main rajya sabha ke paas is sambandh main vishesh shaktiyaan hai
 If a proclamation is made at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place within the period allowed for its approval and if the resolution approving it is made by the Rajya Sabha under Articles 352, 356 and 360 If it is passed within the period specified in the constitution, then that proclamation will remain in effect
 dhan vidheyak keval lok sabha main poor:sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 After it is passed by that House, it is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for its consent or recommendation
 aise vidheyak ke sambandh main rajya sabha kii shakti simit he
 The Rajya Sabha has to return such a bill to the Lok Sabha within fourteen days of its receipt
 yadi yah us avadhi ke bheetar lok sabha ko nahin lautaaya jaataa he to vidheyak ko ukt avadhi kii samaapti par donon sadanon dwaara us rup main paarit kiya gaya samajha jayega jisamen ise lok sabha dwaara paarit kiya gaya tha
 The Rajya Sabha cannot amend the Money Bill; It can only recommend amendments and the Lok Sabha can accept or reject all or any of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha
 dhan vidheyak ke alaava, vitt vidheyakon kii katipay anya shreniyon ko bhi rajya sabha main poor:sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, there are some other types of finance bills in respect of which there is no restriction on the powers of Rajya Sabha
 ye vidheyak kisi bhi sabha main prastut kiye ja sakate hai or rajya sabha ko aise vitt vidheyakon ko kisi anya vidheyak kii tarah hi asweekrut yaa sanshodhit karne kaa adhikaar he
 In fact, such bills cannot be passed by any House of Parliament unless the President has recommended to that House for consideration
 tathaapi, in sari baton se yah nishkarsh nahin nikalataa ki rajya sabha kaa vitt sambandhi maamalon se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The budget of the Government of India is also placed before the Rajya Sabha every year and its members discuss it
 yadhyapi rajya sabha vibhinn mantralayon kii anudaan maangon par matdaan nahin karti - yah maamla anany rup se lok sabha ke liye surakshit he phir bhi, bharat kii sanchit nidhi se kisi dhan kii nikasi tab tak nahin kii ja sakati, jab tak donon sabhaaon dwaara viniyog vidheyak ko paarit nahin kar diya jaataa
 Similarly, the Finance Bill is also brought before the Rajya Sabha
 iske alaava, vibhaag-sambandhit sansadeey sthaayee samitiyaan, jo mantralayon / vibhaagon kii vaarshik anudaan maangon kii jaanch karti hai, sanyukt samitiyaan hai jinamein das sadsy rajya sabha se hote hai
 Apart from the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, the Leader of the House is another officer who plays an important role in the efficient and smooth conduct of the House
 rajya sabha main sabha kaa netaa saamanytah pradhan mantri hota he, yadi vah iskaa sadsy he, athwa koi aisa mantri hota he, jo is sabha kaa sadsy he or jise unke dwaara is rup main kaary karne ke liye naam-nirdisht kiya gaya ho
 Its primary responsibility is to maintain coordination among all sections of the House for amicable and meaningful debate in the House
 is prayojanarth, vah na keval sarkaar ke, balki vipaksh, mantriyon or peethasin adhikari ke bhi nikat sampark main rahata he
 He sits on the first seat in the first row to the right of the Chair in the assembly hall so that he is readily available to the Presiding Officer for consultation
 niyamon ke tahat, sabhapati dwaara sabha main sarkari kaary kii vyavastha, raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa hetu dinon ke aavanton athwa samay ke aavanton, shuukravaar ke alaava kisi anya din ko gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke kaary, aniyat din vaale prastaavon par charchaa, alpakaalik charchaa or kisi dhan vidheyak par vichaar evam use waapas kiye jane ke sambandh main sadan ke netaa se paraamarsh kiya jaataa he
 In the event of the death of a great personality, national leader or a person of international repute, the Chairman may also consult him in the matter of adjournment or otherwise for the House for that day
 gathbandhan sarkaron ke yug main unka kaary or adhik chunauteepurn ho gaya he
 He ensures that all possible and appropriate facilities are provided in the House for meaningful discussion on any matter brought before the House
 vah sabha kii raay vyakt karne or ise samaaroh athwa aupchaarik avasaron par prastut karne main sabha ke vaktaa ke rup main kaary karte hai
 The following members have been the leaders of the House in Rajya Sabha: vidhayika main vipaksh ke netaa ke pad kaa atyadhik saarvajanik mahatv he
 Its importance derives from the main role given to the opposition in parliamentary democracy
 vipaksh ke netaa kaa kaary vastut: atyadhik kathin he kyonki unhen aalochana kerani padati he, galati ingit kerani padati he or aise vaikalpik prastaavon / nitiyon ko prastut karnaa padataa he jinhen lagu karne kaa unhen koi adhikaar nahin he
 Thus they have to bear a special social responsibility towards Parliament and the country
 rajya sabha main varsh 1969 tak vaastavik arth main vipaksh kaa koi netaa nahin hota tha
 Till then, it was customary to consider the leader of the opposition party with the most members as the opposition leader without giving any formal recognition, status or privileges
 vipaksh ke netaa ke pad ko sansad main vipakshi netaa vetan or bhatta adhinium, 1977 dwaara adhikarik manyata pradaan kii gai
 By this Act, the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha is a member of the Rajya Sabha who is for some time in opposition to the government of the party with the largest number of members as recognized by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 is prakaar vipaksh ke netaa ko teen sharten puri kerani hoti hai, namash: Varma varman or Burman) is a caste-related surname of Hinduism, which all Hindus living in present-day India and South East Asia write proudly in front of their names
 mukhyat: kshatriya varna se utpann jati ke log hi verma likhte hai parantu aadhuniktaa ke is daur main anya jatiyon ke log bhi is upnaam ko apane naam ke aage lagane lage hai
 Varma and its other synonym literally means shield or protection
 at: is upnaam ko yuddh main bhaag lene vaale kshatriya yaa rajput hi praaia: prayog karte the
 However, some people of the Brahmin varna living in the state of Orissa, despite knowing that this surname is prescribed only to the Kshatriyas, put Varma, Verman or Burman in front of their name
 jo sambhraant yaa ullekhneey log apane naam ke aage verma, varman athwa burman upnaam likhte hai unamem se kuchhek ke naam yahan diye ja rahe hai
 The Asturias used to be an independent nation called the Kingdom of Asturias in the Middle Ages

 The most prominent city of Asturias is Ovido, the capital of the province
 iskaa bandargah or sabase bada nagar gishaan or sabase mahatvapurn audyogic nagar avilles he
 This is a list of Bien de Interes Cultural which are present in Asturias, Spain: choubeesvin putali karunavati ne jo katha kahi vah is prakaar he- raja vikramaditya kaa sara samay hi apni praja ke dukhon kaa nivaaran karne main bitta tha
 He did not ignore any problem of the subjects

 This habit was also known to the thieves and bandits, so the incidents of crime used to be sporadic

 One night Vikram was wandering in one part of the state in disguise one night that he saw a snake hanging from a big building
 is kamand ke sahare zaroor koi chor hi upar kii manzil tak gaya hoga, yah sochakar ve kamand ke sahare upar pahunche

 a woman was asking someone to go to the next room and slaughter someone
 uskaa kahana tha ki bina us aadmi kaa vadh kiye hue kisi anya ke saath uskaa sambandh rakhana asambhav he
 Then a male voice said that he is definitely a marauder, but it is not possible for him to kill a innocent person
 vah sree ko apane saath kisi sudur sthaan jane ke liye kah rahaa tha or uske vishwaas dilaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha ki uske paas itnaa adhik dhan he ki baaki bachi zindagi ve donon aaraam se basar kar lenge
 She finally asked him to come the next day, because it would have taken at least twenty four hours to raise the money
 raja samaj gaye ki purush us sree kaa premi he tathaa sree us seth kii patni he jiskaa yah bhawan he
 Seth is sleeping in the next room and Sethani was instigating her lover for her slaughter
 raja kamand pakadkar neeche aa gaye or us premi kaa intajaar karne lage
 After some time, the lover of Sethani came down from the limelight, then the king put his sword on his neck and told him that Vikram is standing in front of him
 vah aadmi dar se thar-thar kaanpane laga or praan dand ke bhay se uski ghighghi bandh gai
 When the king promised not to punish him for telling the truth, he told his story like this- "main bachapan se hi usase prem karata tha tathaa uske saath vivaah ke sapane sanjoe hue tha
 i also had a lot of money because my father was a very big businessman
 lekin mere sukhi bhavishya ke saare sapane dhare-ke-dhare rah gaye
 One day my father's ship full of money was looted by pirates

 We became bankrupt

 maine bahut mushkil se unka vishwaas jeeta tathaa unke dal main shaamil ho gaya
 i would kill any one as soon as i got the opportunity
 ek-ek karke maine puure dal kaa safaya kar diya or lut se jo dhan unhone ekatra kiya tha vah lekar apane ghar waapas chalaa aayaa
 On coming home, i came to know that my girlfriend was married to a wealthy Seth and she moved in with her husband
 mere saare sapane bikhar gaye
 One day i got the news of his maternal uncle, so i was happy
 vah aakar mujhase milane lagi or maine sara vrutant use bataa diya
 One day when she met me, she said that she would believe that i have a lot of money only when i put a gullible necklace around her neck
 main naulakha haar lekar gaya
 By then she had gone to her husband
 maine naulakha haar laakar use pati ke ghar main pahana diya to usne apane pati kii hatya karne ko mujhe uksaaya
 i did not agree to say that because killing a innocent person with my own hands i consider it a terrible sin
 " King Vikramaditya praised him for telling the truth and patted him on the shoulder to wipe out the pirates
 unhone use triya charitra nahin samaj paane ki liye daanta
 He said that true girlfriends love lovers, not their wealth
 uski premika ne uski pratiksha nahin kii or sampann vyakti se shaadi kar lee
 On meeting her again, she did not hesitate to malign her husband
 naulakha haar praapt kar lene ke baad bhi uskaa vishwaas karke uske saath chalane ko taiyaar nahin hui
 On the contrary, despite her refusal, she is ready to have her innocent husband murdered
 aisi nishthur tathaa charitraheen sree se prem sirf vinaash kii ore le jayega
 The man fell at the feet of the weeping king and prayed to forgive his crime
 raja ne mrityudand ke badale use veerta or satyavadita ke liye dheron puraskaar die
 That person had realised
 duusare din raat ko us premi kaa bhesh dharkar ve kamand ke sahare uski premika ke paas pahunche
 As soon as they arrived, the woman grabbed a large bag of gold jewelery as her lover and said that she killed Seth by feeding poison and picked all the gold jewelery and diamond gems and filled it in the bag
 jab raja kuch nahin bole to use shaq hua or usne nakli dadhi-munch noch lee
 On finding another man, she started shouting "chor-chor" and mourned Raja as her husband's killer

 jhootha sach hindi ke suprasiddh kathakaar yashpal kaa sarvotkrisht evam vrihadkaay upanyaas he
 This great novel, divided into two parts called 'watan aur Desh' and 'desh ka Bhavishya', depicted an artistic picture on a wide pane of character ejaculation and various irony after the horrific bloodshed and horrific disorder and freedom in the country at the time of Partition
 is
 yah upanyaas hindi sahitya ke sarvottam upanyaason main pariganya mana gaya he
 This novel is divided into two parts
 iskaa pehla bhaag 'vatan or desh' 1958 i0 main viplav karyaalay, lakhanu se prakashit hua or duusare bhaag 'desh kaa bhavishya' kaa prakaashan 1960 i0 main hua
 In the first part, depicting the life of the common people on the pretext of the families of Bhola Pandhe street of Lahore, depicting the division of the country and the horrific communal riots arising out of it, till the refugees migrated from one country to another and forced to flee
 has gone
 duusare bhaag main desh ke nirmaan main hone vaali chukon, netaaon kii bhrashtataa, krantisheel chetana ke bhatkaav, swaarth lipsaa kii tragedy main fasaa madhyavarg or is sab ke baavjood janata kii nirnaayak vijayini shakti kaa sankethik chithran vistrut falak par kiya gaya he
 The main characters of False Truth are Jaydev Puri, his sister Tara and Kanade, wife of Jayadev Puri
 tara or jayadev puri kaa ek parivaar he, kanak kaa doosraa parivaar he
 Through these two family stories, the story of the novel moves forward and becomes multidimensional in great detail
 jhootha sach kii kahani san 1947 main bharat kii aazaadee ke samay mache bhayankar dange kii prishthbhumi ke rup main buni gayi he
 British colonialism, its 'divide and rule' policy, and the Muslim League's 'two Nation Theory', combined with the low sense of untouchability present in the larger Indian society and the suppressed consciousness of communalism emerged such that the whole of India was blown away by such a blaze No other example of which could be found
 maanviya yatnaa ke itihaas main yah vishwa kii krurtam ghatnaon main se ek ghatana maani jaaegi
 The nuisance remained in effect for almost a decade
 taatkaalik hi sahi par vahashi bhaawanaaon kii giraft main aaye hinsak pashu bane manushyon dwaara sampradayik dangon main hajaaron-hajaar vyakti maut ke ghat utaar daale gayi, lakhon visthapit ho gayi, striyon or bacchon ke saath ammanushik atyaachaar kiye gayi or puure desh kii ek vishaal jansankhya ko apana desh yaa vatan chhodkar bharat yaa pakistan main naye sire se basna padaa
 a very poignant and detailed depiction of these situations has been done in the first part of the false truth, 'watan aur desh'
 is bhaag ke ant main sharnaarthiyon ko lekar aane vaali ek bas kaa driver kahata he "rabb ne jinhen ek banaaya tha, rabb ke bandon ne apane vaham or julm se unhen do kar diya
 " jhootha sach ke duusare khand 'desh kaa bhavishya' main swatantraaa-prapti ke baad ke dashak main desh ke vikaas or bhavi nirmaan main buddhijiviyon or netaaon kii pragatisheel or pratigaami bhoomika kaa yatharth tathaa prabhaavapurn ankan kiya gaya he
 Jaidev Puri and Sood represent the example of corrupt politics as representative of regressive powers, and a woman on the path of development with revolutionary consciousness like Tara also presents a sad example of irony in the lust of happiness, prosperity and influence
 karm-karm kii rat lagane vaale pradhanmantri swayan keval bhaashan kaa sahaara lete or phijulkharchi kaa bheeshan udhaaharan prastut karte dikhte hai
 Overall, Yashpal shows that the future of the country is ultimately in the hands of the common people of the country who can see the overall situation and identify the true situation
 isiilie yashpal vibhinn sthitiyon kaa chitra ukerte hai, kisi paatr kaa ek raikhik yaa adarshavaadi chithran nahin karte hai, kyonki vyavhaarik jivan main aisa ho paanaa kamya to he, parantu bahudhaa sambhav nahin ho paata he
 In this novel, the internal weaknesses and lifelessness of the people have also been shown to be very responsible for the country's misery
 parantu, upanyaas ke ant tak jaakar yah pramanit hota he ki yah chithran vastutah vastusthiti kii sahi pahchaan karwaane ke uddeshy se hi kiya gaya he
 At the end of the novel, the corrupt but powerful leader of the Congress, Sood, loses the election and Dr
 Nath grimly comments on the result - "gill, believe me now, the public is not dead
" janata sadaa mook bhi nahin rahati
 The future of the country is not in the grasp of leaders and ministers, it is in the hands of the people of the country
 " False Truth is a large and multi-faceted novel focused on the backdrop of the Partition of India
 isamen vibhaajan ke pehle se lekar vibhaajan ke baad tak ke samay kaa baarik chitrankan kiya gaya he
 Despite keeping Jaydev Puri and his sister Tara at the center, the novel is not a hero or heroine chieftain, and as such, the novel encroaches on the pre-fabricated tie-ups
 yah upanyaas vastutah vibhinn dharmon evam virgon main bante vrihattar jan-samaaj ke utthan-patan kii suvisteern gaatha he, jiskaa chithran vibhaajan ko centre main rakhte hue kiya gaya he
 Yashpal has woven the fabric of this novel with a nuanced view of both the disintegrative sentiment arising in the minds of the people before partition and the lack of dedication and understanding necessary for the organization of the country or governance after partition
 sampradayik chetana kis prakaar maanviya niyati ko dur tak prabhavit karti he tathaa paristhitiyon kii vikat maar jansamanya main nihit krantikari chetana ko bhi kis prakaar kunthit karte hue swaarth lipsaa kii ore mode sakati he, iskaa atyant maarmik chithran yashpal ne is upanyaas main kiya he
 How the middle class of India, while criticizing the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie with revolutionary consciousness, moves towards the tragedy of living the same life itself, its novelty is worth seeing
 upanyaas kaa rachanaatmak gathan itnaa kushal he ki is mahakay upanyaas kii mahakavyatmakataa is rahasy main antarnihit maani gayi he ki iske katha-sanghatan main yah nirnay karnaa kathin ho jaataa he ki 'jhootha sach' tara kii niyati katha ke bahaane desh ke vibhaajan kaa vrittant he yaa ki desh vibhaajan ke parinaam swaroop he tara kii niyati
 In the novel, Tara herself says- "the country was divided because of my destiny or i suffered due to the fate of the country
 " Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma is considered as a staunch opponent of Yashpal, but he probably first declared that 'false Truth' is the best in Yashpal's novels
 uski ginati hindi ke naye-puraane shreshth upanyaason main hogi-- yah bhi nishchit he
 Nemichandra Jain made many accusations on this novel and concluded that even though Hindi novels are among the most important works of literature, the 'false truth' ultimately fails to touch the level of any meaningful achievement
 kavi kunwar narayan ne is upanyaas kii samiksha hi 'kavidrushti kaa abhaav' sheershak se likhi thi
 Apart from this, Anand Prakash is clear that one of the great qualities of this novel is its interestingness and excessive literacy
 


nishchay hi 'saamaajik vaataavaran' or 'aitihaasik yatharth' ke bebaak chithran ko zyaadaatar sahi saahitiyik samaj or abhivyakti se jod paane main yashpal ko paryaapt safalataa mili he
 According to Shivkumar Mishra the 'false truth' was widely appreciated by the readers
 us par 'akhabaari kataran' hone ke aarope bhi idhar-udhar se aaye parantu ramesh kuntal megh ne use 'kala jaisaa likhaa gaya itihaas' kah kar uski rachanaatmak prakruti kii sahi pahchaan kii
 How can a creative event of modern history be separated from history, on such a wide board? Yashpal's specialty is that he presented that history by linking it to his art form
 is upanyaas par lagaaye gayi vibhinn aaropon ke pariprekshya main ramdarsh mishra ji kaa maananaa he ki baaten bahut si he kintu mujhe lagata he ki lekhak ne tatkaaleen ghatnaon or paristhitiyon ke vistaar tathaa maanviya antar satyon kii gahanta, aadhunik niyati or mulya kaa bahut sundar saamanjasy kiya he
 It has been complained that the author's own vision in this novel is not pervasive, but i think it is a good sign for the creative vision of the writer that she travels the free world of reality, not beset by this prejudice
 is
 yah rachanaatmak drushti ek ore lekhak ko yatharth ke sahi swaroop ko dekhne ke liye prerit karti he ,duusari ore chunki yah sarjan drushti he, ghatnaon or tathyon ko jyon-kaa-tyon na dekhakar unhen maanviya satyon ke sandarbh main dekhati he or uske bheetar se kuch nirmit karti he
 Yashpal's vision in the epics presented is not left alone, he is transcendental and he knows what is false and what is not
 lekhak marxvaadi he kintu is upanyaas main uski marxvaadi vichaardhaara apane-aap main haaavee na hokar uski kalatmak drushti kii sahaayak he
 Virendra Yadav, the new in-depth critic of the novels, considered the evaluation of these giant novels to be completely inadequate and inappropriate, according to some hearsay or written notes, saying that the truth is that the false truth is just a novel work Rather, it is a classic document of Indian society and politics in the post-partition period
 kai arthon main yah bharat vibhaajan ke suparichit vimarshon va prabhutvshaalee chintan kaa pratipaksh bhi he
 The great feature of this novel is that neither it seems to be the work of the writer on the other side of the border nor of any male writer
 


do raay nahin ki 'jhootha sach' ko hindi upanyaason main 'clasik' kaa darja hasil he, lekin jaruri he un kaarnon kaa jaananaa jinke kaaran yah 'clasik' kii koti main he
 Therefore it is necessary to read it
 kunwar narayan ji ke dwaara lagaaye gayi aaropon ke jawaab main yashpal ke pramanik bhashyakaar maane jane vaale madhuresh ne ' 'jhootha sach' : upanyaas main mahakavy' sheershak se vistrut samikshatmak aalekh likhaa or kunwar narayan ji ke aaropon kaa vishleshnatmak uttar dete hue ghoshit kiya ki 'jhootha sach' yashpal kii sarvshereshth rachana ke rup main to sweekrut he hi, vah hindi ke das shreshth or ullekhneey upanyaason main se bhi ek he

 san 1834 main farade ne vidyutarasayan se sambandhit apane kuch sankhyatmak prekshanon ko prakashit kiya
 These are called Faraday's laws of electrical decomposition
 iske antargat do niyam hai
 These rules are presented in different ways in textbooks and scientific literature, but the prevalent form is something like this- vidyut apghaton main vidyutagron par jamaa hue padaarth kii maatra dhara kii maatra samaanupati hoti he
 'quantity of current' means charge and not electric current
 'dhara kii maatra' samaan hone par vidyutagron par jamaa / hathaaye gayi padaarth kii maatra us tatv ke tulyanki bhaar ke samaanupati hoti he
 In a nutshell, Faraday's rules can be written as follows - jahaan Notice that m / z is the equivalent weight of the deposited material
 farade ke pratham niyam ke liye, M, F, tathaa z niyat hai ; at: q jitna adhik hoga, utana hi adhik m bhi hoga
 For Faraday's second law, Q, F, and z are constants; Thus, the higher the m / z, the greater the m
 yadi ek saadhaaran sthiti kii baat kii jaay jisamen vidyut dhara niyat rahati ho, to q = i t { \ displaystyle q=it} or
