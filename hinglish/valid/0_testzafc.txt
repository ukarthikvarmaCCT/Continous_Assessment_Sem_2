 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the Norman Conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, for which Norman vocabulary and spelling rules were heavily used
 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition

 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands

 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain

 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world

 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers

 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable

 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he

 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue

 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface

 a large part of the English vocabulary is of French origin, with most of the words coming from anglo-norman

 For example, competition, art, table, publicity, polis, roll, routine, machine, force, and many other words that have either been or are being Englishized; Many are now pronounced under the rules of phonology of English rather than French

 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words

 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task

 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main

 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K

 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English

 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Part of the design philosophy of Perl 6 is to improve the integration of Perl's regular expressions and to increase their scope and capabilities to allow the grammar of the phrase's terminology to be defined
 The result was a short language Perl 6 rule, which is used to define the Perl 6 grammar as well as to provide tools for programmers in the language

 In this sense, regular expressions can denote well-organized language, precisely the category of language accepted by regular finite automata
 haalanki phir bhi susanhati main ek ullekhneey antar he
 Some categories of well-organized languages can be described by regular finite automata, whose size exponentially increases to the smallest regular expression

 Fortunately, more common than regular expressions is simple mapping from non-finite to finite automata, which does not suddenly assume such a large explosive size; This is why nfas are often used as alternative representations of well-organized languages

 Finally, it is worth noting that many regular expression engines in the world apply features that cannot be described in terms of formal language theory by regular expression; See below for more information on this subject

 It is possible to write in the algorithm between the given regular expressions to decide whether the mentioned languages are essentially the same
 This reduces each expression to the extent of the minimum deterministic finite state machine and determines whether they are homogeneous equivalents

 Editor Vim further identifies the distinction between the Word and Word-head categories
 Since characters in many programming languages that can begin as an identification mark are not the same as those that may be present in other positions
 yah drashtavy he ki POSIX regular oxpraishan maanakon kol kairactor claces duusare regular oxpraishan ke rang main, jo unhen sahyog pradaan karte hue unhen saadharantaya POSIX kairactor claces ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Character classes with most other regular expression flavors are used to describe POSIX defined parenthesis indicators
 POSIX basic or vistaarit regular oxpraishan maanakon kii tulana main Perl ke paas adhik susangat or samrudh vaakya-vinyas he
 An example of its continuity is that \ always runs separately from non-alphanumeric characters
 kriyasheeltaa kaa anya udhaaharan Perl ke saath to sambhav he, par POSIX ke saath nahin - anuvarthi regular oxpraishan sust parimann kii avadharana he 
 Because of its widely suggestive capabilities, many other usability and programming languages have adopted syntax like Perl - for example, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework, and w3c's XML
 Schema uses all regular expression syntax like Perl
 kuch bhashaaen evam upkaran jaise ki Boost or PHP bahu regular oxpraishan flavor ko sahyog pradaan karte hai
 Perl derivatives do not have uniformity in implementation of regular expressions and some implement only a subset of Perl's attributes

 Simple regular expression is a syntax that can be used in historical versions of computer application programs and can also be supported by some applications within itself
 pichhali anurupata pradaan karne ke uddeshy se ise anuchit samajha gaya he
 In standard expressions standard modifiers are greedy, meaning they match as many times as they can, leaving the rest to be a new match with the regex
 udhaaharan ke liye,regexes ke liye koi nayaa jo kisi ek item ke bich pratham drushtaant khojna chahta he, is udhaaharan main pratik chihnon ke bich paa saktaa he
 Another whale exploration occurred
 


 jo, pattern ke saath athwa isi ke samaan aana chahega
 haalanki yah pattern vastav main ", " ke badale "" main waapas janaa chahega, jo apekshit tha, kyonki * parimann jo laalchee he -- atah yah yathasambhav adhik se adhik aksharon kaa upbhog input se kar lenaa chahega, evam "january 26>, " ke paas "january 26" kii tulana main adhik akshar honge
 While this problem can be avoided in many ways, modern regular expression tools allow a quantizer to be characterized as sluggish, followed by a question mark after the quantizer, or by using modifiers that reverse the measureer's greed
 gives 
 Indicators first try to match the least, using the sluggish measure
 haalanki purvavarti udhaaharan main sust mail kaa prayog kai melon ke parinaamon main se kisi ek kaa chunaav karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, kuch maamalon main iskaa prayog behatar nishpaadan ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, jab laalchee milan ko adhik peeche hatane kii jarurat padegi
 Patterns for Chaotic Languages many features derived from modern regular expression collections provide suggestive capabilities that exceed those of well-organized languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai karyanvayan up suchakon ke samoohikaran kii anumati pradaan karte hai or usee suchak main mail karaane kii keemat yaad dilaate hai
 This means that a pattern may correspond to repeated words, such as "papa" or "wikiwiki", which in formal language theory is called squares
 in ladiyon ke liye pattern he \ 1
 However, the language of squares is not well-organized
 na hi yah vishay se mukt he
 An unlimited number of back references coincide with the pattern, as is supported by an unlimited number of modern tools, np-complete
 haalanki, kai upkaran, libraries or ingine jo aisi sanrachanaayen uplabdh karaate hai, ab bhi regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa prayog apane patternas ke liye karte hai
 It has named the regular expression vocabulary, which has many different meanings for formal language theory and pattern
 is kaaran, kuch log regex yaa keval pattern shabdaawalee kaa prayog parvarti kii vyakhya main karte hai
 Larry Wall, author of the Perl programming language, writes about the design of Perl 6 in an essay: kam se kam teen alag-alag kalam vidhiyaan kalanvidhi hai, jo nirdhaarit karti hai ki ek diya gaya regular oxpraishan kis prakaar ek string ke saath mail khata he
 Two formal language theories dependent on the oldest and fastest results that accepts the conversion of each non-deterministic finite position machine into a deterministic finite position machine
 DFA kaa spasht rup se nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he or tab iske parinamswaroop input par ek baar main ek pratik chinh par parichaalit hota he
 Creating a DFA for the size of a regular expression at the cost of "O" takes time and memory, but it can only run in o time on a string of n sizes
 ek vaikalpik prayaas NFA ko sidhe anukaran karnaa he, maang karne par anivaary rup se prayek DFA sthiti kaa nirmaan or tab agle kadam par sambhawatah caching ke saath ise baahar nikaal dena
 yah DFA ko antarnihit rakhata he or nirmaan kii ghaataank laagat se bachaa ja saktaa he, lekin chalan laagat o tak bad jaati he
 This explicit step is called the DFA algorithm and the underlying step is called the NFA algorithm
 As both can be seen in different ways in implementing the same DFA, they are also often called algorithms without discrimination
 ye kalan vidhiyaan tej hai lekin samoohikrut upasuchakon ko lautaane ke liye unka prayog sust parimann evam isi prakaar kii visheshtaayen pechida hai
 The third algorithm is to match the input string with the pattern via the back track
 is kalanvidhi ko aamtaur par NFA kaha jaataa he, lekin yah shabdaawalee aspasht he
 Its running time can be exponential, which its simple implementation reveals when matching against indicators such as * b which has both alternation and infinite quantification
 kalanvidhi par jor daalate hai ki sthanapann maamalon kii babbti hui ghaataanki sankhya par vichaar karen
 adhik jatil karyanvayan aksar chihnit or gatisheel karte hai yaa saadhaaran maamalon ko radd kar detii hai, jab unka chalan mand ho jaataa he
 Although back tracking implementations guarantee an exponential in the worst case scenario, they provide much greater flexibility and pointer power
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi bhi karyanvayan jo bakarefrences ke prayog kii anumati detaa he yaa parl dwaara lagu kiye gaye vibhinn ekstensionas ko karyanvit karata he, use back trekking karyanvayan kaa avashya prayog karnaa chahie
 Some implementations provide two of the best algorithms by first running fast DFA to find out if the regular expressions are even slightly matching with the string, and only in this case possibly a dim back tracking match
 regular oxpraishan kaa aarambhik prayog ASCII aksharon ke saath hua
 Many regular expression engines can now work with full Unicode as well
 adhikansh maamalon main isamen koi antar nahin dikhataa ki aksharon kaa set kya he, lekin kuch maamalon main fark padataa he jab regular oxpraishan ko unicode par kaary karnaa padataa he

 During the Mughal period in 1680, Aurangzeb sent a messenger Qazi khalil-ur-rehman to Gorakhpur, probably to receive regular payment of revenue from the local chiefs
 khalil-ur-rahamaan ne hi gorakhpur se sate jilo ke saradaaron ko majaboor kiya tha ki ve rajasav kaa bhugtan kare

 basti shiksha or audyogic main uttar pradesh ke pichde jile main he
 The main language of Basti district is Hindi as well as Bhojpuri and Awadhi, Bhojpuri is used in the eastern regions of the district and Awadhi is used in the western regions
 iske saath hi dakshini or uttari kshetra main bhojpuri or avadhi bhi boli jaati he
 
 krittika vaa kayabachia ek nakshatra he
 Its Latin / English name is Pleiades
 prithvi se dekhne par paas-paas dikhne vaale kai taron kaa is samooh ko bhartiya khagolashastra or hindu dharm main sapt rishi kii patniyaan bhi kaha gaya he
 Kritika is a Tarapanja which appears near the Taurus sign in the sky
 kori aankh se pratham drushti daalane par is punj ke taare aspasht or ek duusare se mili hue tathaa kichpich dikhaai padate hai jiske kaaran bolchaal kii bhashaa main ise kichpichia kehete hai
 On looking carefully, six stars appear separately in it
 doordarshak se dekhne par isamen saikadon taare dikhaai dete hai, jinke bich main niharika kii halaki dhundh bhi dikhaai padati he
 There will be 300 to 500 stars in this Tarapunja which are scattered in 50 light-years circles
 centre main taron kaa ghanatv adhik he
 Bright stars are also near the center
 krittika tarapunj prithvi se lagbhag 500 prakashavarsh dur he
 According to Indian astrology, the third constellation in twenty-seven constellations
 is nakshatra main chah taare hai jo sanyukt rup se agnishikha ke aakaar ke jaan padate hai
 The Kritika is said in mythological rituals to be the daughter of Daksha, the wife of the Moon and the father of Kartikeya
 krittika naam par hi kartikeya naam padaa he
 The Bhagavata Purana is one of the eighteen Puranas of the Hindus
 ise shrimadbhagwatam yaa keval bhagwatam bhi kehete hai
 Its main theme is Bhakti Yoga, in which Krishna is depicted as the God of all the Gods or God Himself
 iske atirikt is puraana main ras bhav kii bhakthi kaa nirupan bhi kiya gaya he
 Traditionally, the author of this Purana is considered Veda Vyasa
 shrimadbhagwat bhartiya vaanmay kaa mukutamani he
 The path of devotion recited by Lord Shukdev to Maharaja Parikshit is as if the step is only
 iske prayek shloke main shrikrishna-prem kii sugandhi he
 It has a wonderful collection of inspiring anecdotes with means-knowledge, siddhigyan, means-devotion, siddha-bhakti, maryada-marg, grace-path, dvaita, advaita coordination
 ashtadash puraanon main bhagwat nitant mahatvapurn tathaa prakhyat puraana he
 In calculating the Puranas, the Bhagavata is counted as the Ashtam Purana
 bhagwat puraana main maharishi soot goswami unke samaksh prastut saadhuon ko ek katha sunaate hai
 The sages ask him questions about various incarnations of Vishnu
 soot goswami kehete hai ki yah katha unhone ek duusare rishi shukdev se suni thi
 It has a total of twelve ties
 pratham kand main sabhi avtaron ko saransh rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 Nowadays, two Puranas bearing the 'bhagwat' legend are available: at: in donon main puraana koti main kiski gananaa apekshit he ? is prashn kaa samaadhaan aavashyak he
 Finally, after reviewing it in various ways, it seems that Shrimad Bhagwat should be considered as Puran and it is appropriate to keep Devi Bhagwat in the category of Uppurana
 shrimadbhagwat devibhagwat ke swarupanirdesh ke vishay main maun he
 But Devi Bhagwat counts 'bhagavata' under the subpuras and itself under the Puranas
 devibhagapancham skandh main varnit bhuvankosh shrimadbhagwat ke pancham skandh main prastut is vishay kaa aksharsh: anukaran karata he
 In Shree Bhagwat, the eight verses representing the glory of Bharatvarsha are quoted literally in the Bhagwat in the same order
 donon ke varnanon main antar itnaa hi he ki shrimadbhagwat jahaan vaigyanik vishay ke vivaran ke nimitt gadhy kaa naiysargik madhyam pakadta he, vahaan vishistataa ke pradarshanath devibhagwat padya ke kritrim madhyam kaa prayog karata he
 Shrimad Bhagavat coordinates Bhaktiras and spiritual science
 bhagwat nigamkalpataru kaa swayanfal mana jaataa he jise naishthik brahmacharee tathaa brahmagyani maharishi shuk ne apni madhur vaani se sanyukt kar amritamay bana daalaa he
 The Bhagwat himself states- 'vidyavataan bhagavate pariksha' : bhagwat vidvatta kii kasuti he or isi kaaran tikasampatti kii drushti se bhi yah athulaneey he
 Scholars of various Vaishnava sects have advocated self-explanatory interpretations on Bhagavat for the subsistence and affirmation of their specific doctrine, in which some commentators are briefly mentioned here: bhagwat ke deshkal kaa yatharth nirnay abhi tak nahin ho paaya he
 In the eleventh wing, people drinking water from Dravidian rivers like Kaveri, Tamraparni, Kritamala, etc
 have been shown as devotees of Lord Vasudeva
 ise vidvan log tamil desh ke alwaron kaa spasht sanket maanate hai
 In the Bhagwat, with specific signs of Vaishnava pilgrimage, rivers and mountains of the South, some scholars consider Tamil Nadu to be the place of its rise
 kaal ke vishay main bhi paryaapt matbhed he
 It is certain that Hemadri, eminent theologian and minister of Bopdev, Mahadev and King Ramachandra, in his 'chaturvarga Chintamani' has quoted many of Bhagwat's words, cannot be considered the author of Bhagwat
 shankaracharya ke dada guru gudpadacharya ne apane 'panchikarnavyakhya' main 'jagrihe paurushan rupam' tathaa 'uttargita tikaa' main 'shrey: srutin bhakthi mudasy te vibho' bhagwat ke do shlokon ko uddhrut kiya he
 With this, the creation of Bhagwat cannot be considered archaic by the seventh century
 nimnlikhit talika main kuch vidwaanon dwaara sujhaayaa gaya bhagwat puraana kaa rachanakaal diya gaya he- The influence of Bhagwat was very active in the rise of medieval Vaishnava sects and was particularly important in the rise of Krishna poems of the provincial languages of India
 bhagwat se hi sphurti tathaa prerana grahan kar brajabhasha ke ashtachhaapi, nimbarki, radhavallabheey kaviyon ne brajabhasha main radhakrishna kii lilaon kaa gayan kiya
 Vidyapati of Mithila, Chandidas, Gyanadas and Govindadas of Bengal, Shankardev and Madhavdev of Assam, Upendra Bhanj and Dinakrishnadas of Utkal, Namdev and Madhav Pandit of Maharashtra, Narsi Mehta of Gujarat and Meerabai of Rajasthan - all these saints and poets of the Bhagwat era
 Inspired by the narration, Radhakrishna has sung a beautiful keli in his various poems
 tamil, andhra, kannada tathaa malayalam ke vaishnav kaviyon ke upar bhi bhagwat kaa prabhaav bhi kam nahin he
 Bhagwat's spiritual outlook is of monotheism and devotion is devotional
 is prakaar advait ke saath bhakthi kaa samrasya bhagwat kii apni vishistataa he
 For these reasons, Bhagwat is considered to be the undercurrent of Kavyatrayi of Sanskrit along with Valmiki Ramayana and Mahabharata
 bhagwat main 18 hajaar shloke, 335 adhyay tathaa 12 skandh hai
 The leelavataras of Vishnu are described in its Sukumar language in its various wings
 parantu bhagavan krishna kii lalit lilaon kaa vishad vivaran prastut karanevaala dasham skandh bhagwat kaa hriday he
 In other Puranas, such as Vishnupurana, Brahmavaivarta, etc
, the character of Krishna is also fixed, but in the tenth wing, the character of Lilapurushottam is described as unique with the sweet language, soft design and devotion
 raasapanchadhyaayi aadhyatm tathaa sahitya ubhay drushtiyon se kavyangat main ek anuthi vastu he
 The Venugit, the Gopigit, the Yuga Geet, the Bhramgeet, have elevated the Bhagavata to a sublime level of poetry

 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 a meaningful change of what is said or written in one language in another language is called translation
 anuwaad kaa kaary bahut puraane samay se hota aayaa he
 In Sanskrit, the word 'translation' has been used in many contexts such as repetition, re-statement, statement used for support, frequency by the disciple
 sanskrit ke ’vad‘ dhaatu se ’anuwaad‘ shabd kaa nirmaan hua he
 'vad' means to speak
 ’vad‘ dhaatu main 'a' pratyay jod dene par bhavvaachak sangya main iskaa parivartit rup he 'vaad' jiskaa arth he- 'kehane kii kriya' yaa 'kahi hui baat'
 The word 'translation' is formed by adding the prefix 'anu' to 'ism', which means to say the received statement again
 iskaa prayog pehali baar monier williams ne angreji shabd tansleshan ke paryaay ke rup main kiya
 Only then, the word 'translation' was used to refer to the re-presentation of material presented by someone in one language into another
 vastav main anuwaad bhashaa ke indradhanushi rup kii pahchaan kaa samarthatam maarg he
 The imperative of translation cannot be avoided by making noise of the prosperity of a language and neither can it be denied the multicolon utility of translation
 jt
 Six jpvch ke paryyswaroop ’anuwaad‘ shabd kaa sweekrut arth he, ek bhashaa kii vichaar saamagree ko duusari bhashaa main pahunchnaa
 There is also a practice of 'ultha' in Hindi for translation
 angreji main TRANSLATION ke saath hi TRANSCRIPTION kaa prachlan bhi he, jise hindi main 'lipyantaran' kaha jaataa he
 The difference between translation and transliteration is clear from this example - isse spasht he ki 'anuwaad' main hindi vaakya ko angreji main prastut kiya gaya he jabaki lipyantaran main nagari lipi main likhi gayi baat ko maatr roman lipi main rakh diya gaya he
 'bhashaparan' and 'metamorphosis' have also been used for translation
 lekin ab in donon hi shabdon ke nae arth or upyog prachlit hai
 The use of 'bilingual' and 'metamorphosis' is synonymous with the term INTERPRETATION in English, which means establishing linguistic contact between two people
 kannadabhashi vyakti or asamiyabhaashi vyakti ke bich kii bhashik duuri ko bhashaantaran ke dwaara hi dur kiya jaataa he
 These days, the term 'metamorphosis' is often used to represent the creation of one genre in another genre
 jais, premachand ke upanyaas 'godaan' kaa roopantaran 'hori' naatak ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Translation is the submission of ideas expressed in one language in another language
 is vishesh arth main hi 'anuwaad' shabd kaa abhipraay sunishchit he
 The language from which translation is done is the native language or source language
 usase jis nai bhashaa main anuwaad karnaa he, vah 'prastut bhashaa' yaa 'lakshya bhashaa' he
 In this way, translation is the translation of the sentiment or idea presented in the source language into the target language without any change
 ja a good translator is one who- anuwaad asaadhaaran rup se kathin or ahvaahanaatmak kaary mana jaataa he
 It is a complex, artificial, need-generating, and visually creative process that requires extraordinary and exceptional talent
 yah isaki apni prakruti he
 But it is believed that due to lack of original writing, translation does not get a place of honor
 kyonki is baat kii avganana hoti he ki anuwaad isiilie kathin he ki vah moulik lekhan nahin-pehle kahi gai baat ko hi dubaara kahana hota he, jisamen anek niyantranon or bandhanon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Thus, the importance of translation was reduced due to being non-formal, but for this reason the controls and restrictions required for it were not considered important
 is sambandh main srujansheel lekhakon ke vichaaron kii praayah charchaa hoti rahi he
 Some ideas are as follows: sampoorn anuwaad kaary keval ek asamadhey samasya kaa samaadhaan khojane ke liye kiya gaya prayaas maatr he
 The translation of a work increases its faults and squares its virtues
 kala kii ek vidha ke rup main anuwaad kabhi safal nahin ho sakate
 Translators are deceptive
 aise vichaaron ke udbhav ke peeche tatkaaleen paristhitiyaan tathaa unase prerit dharanaayen maani jaati hai
 Earlier, most of the translation material were literary works, whose translation could not meet the expectations of the reader due to limitations of the literary nature of the works
 saath hi yah bhi dharna thi ki rachana kii bhashaa ke prayek ansh kaa anuwaad apekshit he, jisase mul samvednaa kaa koi ansh chat na paae, or kyonki yah sambhav nahin, atah anuwaad ko pravanchana kii koti main rakh diya gaya tha
 This situation largely lasted until the first half of the nineteenth century in which translation was more driven primarily by personal interest, less driven by social need
 iske atirikt moulik lekhan kii parimangat prachurtaa ke kaaran bhi is prakaar kii raay bani
 After the split of imperialism after the second world war, many small and big nations became independent and the question of their identity became important
 sangheey ganraajyon ke ghatak bhi apni asmita ke vishay main sachet hone lage
 In this state of contact-establishment and identity-development, the language has a central place, which appears as a state of multilingualism
 isamen anuwaad kii satta avashyambhavi he
 As a result, translation has primarily become a social necessity
 vividh prakaar ke lekhanon ke anuwaad hone lage
 Translation work became a business
 anuvaadakon ko prashikshit karne ke abhikaran sthapit ho gaye, jinamein alpakaaleen or purnsatreey paathyakramon or kaaryshaalaaon aadi kaa aayojan kiya jane laga
 It also resulted in the change of social attitude towards translation on the one hand and on the other hand, the development of translation theory from the cognitive point of view received special emphasis and the need for translation theory was accepted for translation training courses
 falswaroop, anuwaad siddhanth ek apekshaakrit swatantra gyaanshakha ban gaya, jisaki jaankaree anuvadak, anuwaad shikshak, or anuwaad sameekshak, teenon ke liye upadey hua
 Theoretical discussion about translation originated in the modern era itself, understanding it as being contrary to both fact and logic
 anuwaad kaary kii lambi parampara ko dekhte hue yah maananaa tarksangat ban gaya ki anuwaad kaary ke vishay main saiddhanthik charchaa kii parampara bhi puraani he
 In the writings of Cicero in the first century BCE, the seeds of translation thinking are received and thereafter scholars have been expressing their views on this subject
 is chintan kii prishthbhumi bhi avashya rahi he, yadhyapi use spasht rup se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya
 It is definitely believed that just as the translation work is organized in modern form, the development of relatively well-defined background of translation theory is also due to modern era
 anuwaad siddhanth ke aadhunik sandarbh kii mul visheshta he isaki bahupaksheeyata
 It is not based on an integrated background, but based on the coordinated background of many but interrelated scriptures, whose background is made up of relevant parts
 mukhya shaastra hai - paath sanket vigyaan, sampreshan siddhanth, bhashaa prayog siddhanth, or tulanaatmak anuprayukt bhashavigyaan
 It is also pertinent to clarify that due to the practical importance of human translation and mechanical translation on the one hand, and written translation and oral translation on the other, the thinking about their theoretical side has started
 tathaapi maanavkrut likhit madhyam ke anuwaad kii hi parimangat tathaa gunatmak pradhanta maani jaati rahi he tathaa inase sambandhit saiddhanthik chintan ke mudde vishesh rup se praasangik hai
 Although the tradition of translation thought in ancient Indian tradition is not as organized and as written, as in the West, however, the seeds of translation thought are available
 tadnusaar, anuwaad punarukti he - ek bhashaa main vyanjit sandesh ko duusari bhashaa main punah kahana
 This approach towards translation seems to be different from the accepted notion in the western tradition
 parantu is drushti ko apnaane se anuwaad sambandhi anek saiddhanthik binduon kii adhik vishad tathaa sangat vyakhya kii gai he
 In this regard, the second point of view is dialectics
 jo aadhunik he tathaa mukhya rup se sanrachnawad kii dein he
 It is clear from looking at the tradition of translation work that the thinking of the theory of Anavad has become more about literary works
 yah sthiti sangat bhi he
 In the past era, only literary works were selected for translation
 ab bhi saahitiyik kritiyon ke hi anuwaad adhik pariman main hote hai
 However, translation of non-literary writings has also started to occur in greater quantity due to the request of circumstances
 vishesh baat yah he ki donon kotiyon ke lekhanon main ek moolbhoot antar he
 Which can be expressed more clearly in the terminology of subjectivity and individualism of the writer
 vyaktinishth lekhan kaa, apni prakruti kii visheshta se, kuch apana hi sandarbh he
 Having said this, we are not denying the common background of both, but in the context presented, we want to specifically highlight the distance and relative autonomy of both
 yah uchit hi he ki bhashaprayog ke paksh se nirvaiyaktik lekhan ke anuwaad ke saiddhanthik sandarbh ko bhi vishesh rup se ubhaara jaae
 An evolutionary dimension of translation theory is the tendency to research
 anuwaad siddhanth kii bahuvidyaparak prakruti ke kaaran vibhinn kshetron ke visheshgy-bhashavigyaani, samajashastri, manovigyaani, shikshavid, nritatvvigyaani, soochna siddhanth visheshgy-paraspar sahyog ke saath anuwaad ke saiddhanthik ansho par shodhakarya main ruchi lene lage
 The field of translation work increased
 alag-alag samskritiyon ke logon main sampark badha - log videshon main shiksha ke liye jate, vyapaarik-audyogic sanghathan vibhinn deshon main kaam karte, vibhinn bhashaa bhashi log sammelnon main ek saath baithkar vimarsh karte, rashtron ke madhya rajanyik anubandh hone lage
 In all these there was an urgent need for translation and specific problems of translation began to emerge
 in samasyaon kaa adhyayan anuwaad sambandhi anusandhan kaa urvar kshetra bana
 On the one hand, new thinking emerged on the basis of the evidence presented by translation on the relation between language and culture on the one hand and language and thought on the other
 mashin anuwaad tathaa maukhik anuwaad ke kshetron main nai-nai sambhaavnaayen saamne aane lagi, jisane in kshetron main anuwaad anusandhan ko gati pradaan kii
 The new areas of language study also inspired the experts to think innovatively on the traditional fields of human translation and written translation
 in sab pravritiyon se anawaad siddhanth ko pratishtha kaa pad milane laga or ise saiddhanthik shodh ke ek upyukt kshetra ke rup main sweekruti praapt hone lagi
 The first meaningful attempt at translation was made by HH Wilson in 1855 through the 'glory of Judicial and Revenue Terms'
 san 1961 main rajbhasha vidhaayi ayog kii sthapana hui
 Its task was to prepare an All India Standard Law Terminology
 1970 main vidhi shabdaawalee kaa prakaashan hua
 It is growing
 iskaa naveen sanskaran 1984 main niklaa
 This commission has translated many texts related to law
 kai nyaayalayon main nyaayadhish hindi main bhi nirnay dene lage he
 The tradition of translation is very old
 bebal ke minar kii katha prasiddh hi he, jo is tathy kii ore sanket karti he ki, maanav samaaj main anek bhashaayen boli jaati hai
 It can be logically inferred that translation behavior may have originated much earlier due to the social imperative of mutual contact
 parantu jahaan tak likhit pramaanon kaa sambandh he, At a larger level, translation happens only if the two different linguistic communities maintain long-term contacts and as part of an effort to balance them, people from under-developed cultures enrich their literature by translating the literature of well-developed people
 greek se latin main or arabi se europea bhashaaon main prachar anuwaad isi pravriti ke parinaam maane jate hai
 The translation work is divided into two parts - ancient and modern in terms of trends in history
 pracheen yug main mukhyatah teen prakaar kii rachnaaon ke anuwaad praapt hote hai
 Because in these three areas, books were often composed
 wein kshetra hai - sahitya, darshan or dharm
 Among the literary works, Iliad and Odesi in Greek, Ramayana in Sanskrit and Mahabharata are such texts which were widely translated
 darshanik rachanaaon main plato ke samvaad, anuwaad kii drushti se lokapriy hue
 Most translations of the Bible are found in religious writings
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad ke madhyam se pracheen yug ke ye mahaan granth ab vibhinn bhashaa bhashiyon ko uplabdh hone lage hai
 The specialty of these translations in terms of translation techniques is that, in the ancient era, these translations were exclusively unilateral, ie the language in which the translations were made did not translate any of their works into the original text
 iskaa kaaran yah ki mul granthon kii tulana main lakshyabhasha ke granth praayah utane utkrisht nahin hote the, duusari baat yah ki mul grathon kii bhashaa ke prati atyant aadar bhaavana ke kaaran lakshya bhashaa ke rup main prayog main laana sambhavtah anuchit samajha jaataa tha
 The field of translation has expanded in the modern era
 uparyukt teen ke atiri vigyaan, praudyogiki, chikitsashastra, prashasan, kootneeti, vidhi, jansampark tathaa anya anek kshetron ke granthon or rachanaaon kaa anawaad bhi hone laga he
 The translations of the modern era tend to be bilateral in comparison to the translations of the ancient era
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad kaa aarthik or raajnneetik mahatva bhi pratishthit ho gaya he
 Bilingual texts of the form of political, economic and cultural agreements between different nations are prepared
 bahurashtriya sansthaaon ko ek se adhik bhashaaon kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In the United Nations, every work is done in five or six languages
 in sab main anivaary rup se anuwaad kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There is also a justification for this situation
 aadhunik yug main hui audyogic, praudyogic, aarthik or raajnneetik kranti ke falswaroop vishwa ke rashtron main ek-duusare ke nikat sampark kii aavashyaktaa kii chetana kaa ativ sheeghra vikaas hua, uske kaaran anuwaad ko yah mahatva milanaa swaabhaavik mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that if the personal interest of the translator was more than the motivational power of the ancient era, then the socio-economic-political need of translation has emerged as a strong driving force in the modern era
 is sthiti ke anek udhaaharan milte hai
 The writings of writers of linguistic minorities are translated and read more in other languages
 apekshaakrit chote tathaa bahubhashi rashtron ko apane desh ke bheetar hi vibhinn bhashabhashi samudaayon ke madhya sampark sthapit karne kii samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Due to this importance of translation according to social need, translation work is now seen to be organized in an organized manner
 raajnneetik-aarthik kaarnon se utpann aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye anuwaad ab ek vyavsaay ban chukaa he tathaa vyaktigat hone ke saath-saath uskaa sanghathanaatmak rup bhi pratishthit hota dikhataa he
 In educational institutions, arrangements are made to teach translation skills and training institutes also work independently
 ek vishisht prakaar ke bhashik vyapaar ke rup main anuwaad, bhartiya parampara kii drushti se, koi nai baat nahin
 In fact, the word 'translation' and the linguistic business available from it have been in Indian tradition long back
 atah 'anuwaad' shabd or iske angreji paryaay ‘transleshan' ke vyutpattimulak or pravritimulak arthon kii sahaayta se anuwaad kii paribhaasha or uske swaroop ko shreshthatar rup se janaa ja saktaa he
 The etymological meaning of 'translation' is - re-statement; Say something once said again
 isamen 'arth kii punrariti hoti hai, shabd kii nahin
 The etymological meaning of the word 'translation' means 'transit' means to move from one place point to another
 yah sthaan-bindu bhashik paath he
 In this too, the object to be carried has meaning, not the word
 uparyukt donon shabdon main antar vyutpattimulak arth kii drushti se he, atah satahi he
 The similarity of the two is evident in actual practice
 arth kii punrariti ko hi duusare shabdon main or prakaaraantar se, arth kaa bhashaantaran kaha jaataa he, jisamen kai baar mul bhashaa kii roopaatmak-gathnaatmak visheshtaayen lakshyabhasha main sakrant ho jaati he
 In fact, the Indian tradition meaning of the word 'translation' is also valid in modern context and the nature of translation is partly understood by making it the focal point
 tadnusaar, anuwaad kaary ke teen sandarbh hai - sambhashik, anybhashik or antarasanketaparak
 In the linguistic context, the repetition of meaning occurs within the same language range, but its dimensions vary
 mukhya aayam do hai -kalkramik or samakalik
 On the chronological dimension, linguistic translation occurs in two adjacent stages of historical development of the same language, eg, translation from old Hindi to modern Hindi
 samakalik aayam par sambhashik anuwaad mukhya rup se teen staron par hota he - boli, style or madhyam
 There can be four sub-levels of bilingual translation at the dialect level: ek bhugolic boli se duusari bhugolic boli main; jaise braj se avadhi main
 From non-standard dialect to standard dialect; For example, Ganjam from Oriya to Puri or from Nagpur Marathi to Pune Marathi
 boli rup se bhashaa rup main, jaise braj yaa avadhi se hindi main From one social dialect to another social dialect, such as from the language of the uneducated or under-educated to the language of the educated or from the language of the people initiated in one religion from the language of the people initiated in the other religion
 style str par sambhashik anuwaad ko style-vikalpan ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 a good example of this is the translation from formal style to informal style; Like 'smoking is forbidden' → 'smoking cigarette smoking is prohibited'
 isi prakaar ‘tubey vaayu aadhaan main samamiti nahin rah gai
 Is' -> 'tire air has gone out'
 madhyam kii drushti se sambhashik anuwaad kii sthiti vahaan hoti he jahaan maukhik madhyam main prastut sandesh kii likhit madhyam main yaa iske vipareet punrariti kii jaae; jaise, maukhik madhyam kaa kaa ek vaakya he : "samay kii seemaa ke kaaran main apane shrotaaon ko adhik vistaar se is vishay main nahin bataa paaoonga
 "it is probably considered appropriate to say in the written medium in this way:" Due to the limitation of space, i will not be able to explain this topic in more detail to my readers
 " 
 The above examples of linguistic translation make two things clear
 arthantaran yaa arth kii punrariti kii prakriya main shabdachayan tathaa vaakya-vinyas donon prabhavit hote hai
 In medium translation, the characteristics of the phonation process take the form of characteristics of the written system or vice versa
 boli, style, or madhyam ke ayaamon ke madhya kathor vibhaajan rekha nahin, api tu inamen aanshik ativyapti pai jaati he, jisaki sambhaavna bhashaa prayog kii pravriti main hi nihit he
 As such, the partial power of stylistic translation is reflected in the medium translation, and accordingly 'to be able to explain the subject' as in the oral medium, so informal, selective, taking a touch of formality in the written medium becomes 'clarifying'
 is
 isi prakaar shailigat anuwaad main samaajik boligat anuwaad bhi kabhi-kabhi samavisht ho jaataa he
 For example, in the dialect of the educated, the formal style may have a tendency to predominance, and in the dialect of the under-educated or uneducated, the informal style may be
 sambhashik anuwaad kii samasyaayen na keval rochak hai api tu anybhashik anuwaad kii drushti se mahatvapurn bhi hai
 The importance of linguistic translation becomes even more evident when translation is seen as a mode of linguistics
 iske atirikt anybhashik anuwaad kii prakruti ko samajhane kii drushti se sambhashik anuwaad kii prakruti ko samajhnaa na keval sahaayak he, api tu aavashyak bhi he
 It can be said that translation is derived language, which has two references - bilingual and dialectical
 is sandarbh bhed se anuwaad vyavhaar main antar aa jaataa he, parantu donon hi sthitiyon main anuwaad kii prakruti vahi rahati he
 The other language translation occurs between two languages
 ye do bhashaayen aitihaasikta or kshetreeyata ke samanvit mandand par swatantra bhashaaon ke rup main pahachaani jaati hai
 Historically, languages coming in the same stream are generally seen as independent languages in that case if they are not closely embedded in chronology, such as Sanskrit and Hindi; Prakrit languages come between these two
 isi prakaar kshetreeyata kii drushti se prativeshi bhashaaon main atyadhik aadan-pradaan hone par bhi unhen bhinn bhashaayen hi maananaa hoga, jaise hindi or punjabi
 In the context of other languages translation, the independent existence of the respective languages is a matter of importance
 sambhashik anuwaad kii tulana main anybhashik anuwaad saamaajik or vyaavhaarik drushti se adhik mahatvapurn he
 From the point of view of linguistic, there is a qualitative difference between problems of linguistic translation from problems of linguistic translation
 is prakaar sambhashik anuwaad se sambandhit hote hue bhi anybhashik anuwaad, apekshaakrit swanishtha vyapaar he
 Both of the above references to the word translation are relatively limited
 inamen anuwaad ko bhashaa-sanketon kaa vyapaar mana gaya he
 In fact, language-socket is a special category of symbols, through which communication work is done
 sampreshan ke liye vibhinn kotiyon ke sanketon ko kaam main liya jaataa he
 These are called common figures
 is drushti se bhi anuwaad shabd kii paribhaasha kii jaati he
 According to this, the reiteration of what is said by one sign by another category of signs, this type of translation is called intertextual translation
 yah saamaanya sanket vigyaan ke antargat he
 The signs are divided into linguistic and linguistic by assuming linguistic signals to be the focal point
 bhashetar main do bhaag hai - bahya or aantarik 
 From the translation point of view, the following categories of sign-change business can be made: 1
 bahya sanket kaa bahya sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi desh kaa maanchitr us desh kaa anuwaad he; kisi praani kaa chitra us praani kaa anuwaad he
 2
 Translation of external signs into linguistic signs - According to this, any word used in a language for a creature is a translation of that creature
 is drushti se vastutah yaha bhashaa darshan kii samasya he jisaki vyakhya arth ke sanket siddhanth main kii gai he
 3
 Translation from internal signal to internal signal - According to this, translating any event into its sensory sensation is translation of this category
 spasht he ki is sthiti kii vaastavik satta nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, this category is determined only from the point of view of theory
 4
 aantarik sanket se bhashik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi aantarik samvednaa ke liye kisi shabd kaa prayog karnaa is koti kaa anuwaad he
 It is said more clearly that, upon contact with a physical condition - eg, seeing an accident, looking at a view of nature, putting an arm on an object, smelling something; In other words, the sense of sensation that arises in the mind is a kind of sign - when the senses are in proximity
 uske liye bhashaa ke kisi shabd kaa prayog karnaa yaa bhashik sanket dwaara uski punrariti karnaa is koti kaa anuwaad kehalaayegaa
 For example, the word 'mourning' is used in Hindi to indicate a specific type of anguish and for another the word 'love'
 samajha jaataa he ki ek samvednaa kaa anuwaad ‘shok' shabd dwaara kiya jaataa he or duusari kaa 'prem' dwaara
 From this point of view it is said that the entire fundamental expression is translation
 vaktaa yaa lekhak apane samvednaa rupi sanketon kii bhashik sanketon main punrariti kar detaa he
 From this point of view, it is the problem of language psychology, which is explained in the stimulus-response theory
 is prakaar, anuwaad shabd kii vyapak paridhi main teenon sandarbhon ke anuwaadon kaa sthaan he -sambhashik anuwaad, anybhashik anuwaad, or antarasanketaparak anuwaad
 All three have their own theoretical basis
 in teenon ke madhya kaa bhed jaananaa mahatvapurn he
 The translator has to fix who is the central position among these three and how the remaining two have relation with them
 saiddhanthik auchity kii drushti se anybhashik anuwaad kii sthiti kendriya he
 Only by the word 'translation' is the meaning of the dialectical translation
 iskaa mul he dwibhashabaddhata
 In both the interpretation and expression of the translator, languages are tied to the language and these languages also differ not in terms of distinction, but in terms of code; Such as Hindi and English, Hindi and Sindhi etc
 is kendriya sthiti ke do chor hai
 On the first end, there is linguistics in both cases, but the language remains the same
 sthitiyon ko antar usee bhashaa ke bhedon ke antar par aadhaarit hota he
 This is an equilateral translation
 paribhaashik shabdon ke prayog kii spashtataa ke liye ise 'anvayaantar' yaa 'shabdaantaran' kaha jaataa he
 At the other end, there is a change in the linguistic signal to the language
 sanket paddati kaa yah parivartan bhashaa prayog kii saamaanya sthiti ko janm detaa he
 In terminology it is called 'language practice'
 in teenon main sambandh tathaa antar donon hai
 This relationship is common
 anuwaad kii drushti se mahatvapurn baat yah he ki vaastavik anuwaad kaary main tathaa anudit paath ke moolyankan main anuvaadakon ko sambhashik anuwaad tathaa antarasanketaparak anuwaad kii sankalpanaaon se sahaayta milti he
 This requirement comes out clearly only when the translator is stuck while doing the translation - the original text is unable to be understood, it is difficult to adequately explore the pure and appropriate translation in the target language, the translator would have to check it How successful the translation is, etc
 pravritimulak main 'anuwaad' shabd se anybhashik anuwaad kaa hi arth liya jaataa he
 And for this reason, Shanai: Shanai: It has also become a matter of principle that translation is a process between two languages
 is sthiti kaa sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The word 'chhaya' in Sanskrit tradition is used to indicate this situation
 anuwaad ke swaroop ko samajhane ke liye anuwaad kii paribhaasha vishesh rup se sahaayak he
 Given the multilaterality of translation, the definition of translation has been presented from various perspectives
 mukhya drushtikon teen prakaar ke hai - anuwaad ek prakriya he
 Translation is a process or / and its result
 anuwaad ek sambandh kaa naam he
 The following definitions are cited under this approach: "mulbhasha ke sandesh ke samamoolya sandesh ko lakshyabhasha main prastut karne kii kriya ko anuwaad kehete hai
 This value of messages is first in terms of meaning and then style, and is near and natural
 " "translation is the process by which meaningful experiences are communicated from one language-community to another
 " "installing the text of one language by synonyms of another language is called translation
 " "translation is a craft in which an attempt is made to present the same message in another language instead of a message written in one language
 " The following written definition is cited under this: "ek bhashaa yaa bhashabhed se duusari bhashaa yaa bhashabhed main pratipaadya ko sthaanantarit karne kii prakriya yaa uske parinaam ko anuwaad kehete hai
 " iske antargat nimnlikhit paribhaasha aati he : "translation is a relation between two or more texts; these texts perform the same function in the same situation
" " While this classification of translation definitions explains the multilaterality of the nature of translation, it also indicates that, definitions of translation can also vary according to different purposes
 is prakaar ye sabhi paribhaashaayen maanya hai
 Based on these definitions, two sides of translation are considered
 anuwaad ke do paksh hai - pehla sankriyaatmak paksh at ev gatisheel or doosraa saiddhanthik paksh at ev sthitisheel
 In operational terms, translation is a process
 anuwaad ke paksh kaa sambandh anuwaad karne ke kaary se he jiske liye 'anuwaad kaary' shabd kaa prayog karnaa uchit mana jaataa he
 In theory, translation is a relationship between two or more languages, but between texts in different languages; But they should be synonyms
 is sambandh kaa udghaatan tulanaatmak paddati ke adhyayan se kiya jaataa he
 The coordinated form of these two is found in the assumption that translation is an abstraction - the result of action is translation - which is related to the relation of synonymy to its original text
 nishpatti ke rup main anuwaad ko 'anudit paath' kaha jaataa he
 In this view, there can be many translations of an original text

 Translation has been called the branch of applied linguistics

 The other information about the translation from these definitions is as follows: anuwaad ek bhashaa yaa bhashabhed se duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaa bhed main hota he
 It is of the nature of process, change, transfer, replacement, or repetition
 sthaanantarit hone vaali vastu ko vibhinn naamon se ingit kar sakate hai, jaise paathyasaamagree, sarthak anubhav, soochna, sandesh
 These different names are related to the difference between the various ions of the theoretical background of translation and the objectives of the translation work
 jaise, bhashaagat 'paathyasaamagree' naam se vyakt hone vaali sunishchitata anuwaad ke bhashavaigyanik aadhaar kii visheshta he, jiskaa vishesh upyog mashin anuwaad main hota he
 'information' and 'meaningful experience' indicate the sociocultural basis of translation; And 'sandesh' provides the textual background of the translation
 uparyukt kii visheshta yah hoti he ki iskaa donon bhashaaon main samaan arth hota he
 This similarity of meaning is broad-based and extends from linguistic meaning to contextual meaning

 The twentieth century has been called the era of translation
 yadhyapi anuwaad sabase pracheen vyavsaay yaa vyavsaayon main se ek kehalaata he tathaapi uske jo mahatva beesvin sadi main praapt hua vah usase pehle use nahin mila aisa mana jaataa he
 The main reason for this is that it is only in the twentieth century that linguistic contact, that is, the status of contact started in different linguistic communities
 iske mul kaaran aarthik or raajnneetik maane jate hai
 As a result, the economic-political map of the world began to change
 vartmaan yag main adhiktar rashtron main yadi ek bhashaa pradhan he to ek yaa adhik bhashaayen gaun pad par dikhaai detii hai
 In other words, there are linguistic majorities and linguistic minorities within the same political-administrative unit boundary
 loktantr main sab logon kaa prashasan main samaan rup se bhaag lene kaa adhikaar tabhi sarthak mana jaataa he, jab unke saath unki bhashaa ke madhyam se sampark kiya jaae
 This creates a state of multilingualism and it becomes mandatory to take shelter of translation work in the process of its preservation
 iske atirikt anterrashtriya str par vibhinn rashtron ke bich raajnneetik, aarthik, vaigyanik or praudyogic, tathaa saahitiyik or saanskrithik str par badhate hue aadan-pradaan ke kaaran anuwaad kaary kii anivaaryta or mahatta kii nai chetana prabal rup se viksit hoti hui dikhti he
 Therefore, translation is considered to be a comprehensive and often mandatory and rational position

 In a social context, translation trade takes place in informal situations
 iskaa sambandh dwibhashikta kii sthiti se he
 Bilingualism generally means alternately using two languages at a time
 vartmaan yug ke samaaj kaa ek brihad bhaag aisa he, jo saamaajik sandarbh kii anaupchaarik sthiti main do bhashaaon kaa vaikalpik prayog karata he
 Normally every educated person, semi-educated person of the urban environment, people living in the border region of two different linguistic states, and linguistic minorities, more clearly see the status of bilingualism
 yah dwibhashikta praayah ashrith / sanyukt dwibhashikta kii koti kii hoti he
 The common feature of this is that, everyone thinks in one language, but expresses it in another language
 is sthiti main anuwaad prakriya kaa hona anivaary he
 But this process takes place informally
 vyakti man hi man pehali bhashaa se anya bhashaa main anuwaad kar apni baat kah dete hai
 It has been assumed that translation directly exists when learning another language in another language environment
 yadi swa-bhashaa ke hi parivesh main anya bhashaa sikhi jaae to "code" parivartan kii sthiti aati he, jisamen anuwaad kii sthiti kuch paroksh ho jaati he
 Hence all translations in bilingual form are informal

 Similarly, there are two more areas of translation in means: comparative study of languages and comparative literature discussion
 vastutah bhashaaon ke adhyayan-vishleshan ke liye anuwaad ke dwaara hi vyakti ko yah gyaat hota he ki, ek vaakya main kis shabd kaa kya arth he
