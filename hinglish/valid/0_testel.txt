 Once Nandkishore told the Sanatkumaras that the stigma which was imposed on Sri Krishna by seeing Chauth's moon was overcome by fasting Siddhi Vinayak
 aisa sunakar sanatkumaron ko aashcharya hua
 When he asked Purna Brahm Sri Krishna the story of stigma, Nandkishore told
 ek baar jarasandh ke bhay se shrikrishna samudr ke madhya nagari basaakar rahane lage
 Nowadays the name of this city is Dwarikapuri
 dwarikapuri main nivas karne vaale satrajit ne suryanarayan kii aradhana kii
 Then Lord Surya gave him a gem called Syamantaka, which gave him eighty pieces of gold, from his neck
 mani paakar satrajit jab samaaj main gaya to shrikrishna ne us mani ko praapt karne kii ichha vyakt kii
 Satrajit did not give the gem to Shri Krishna and gave it to his brother Prasenjit
 ek din prasenjit ghode par chadhakar shikaar ke liye gaya
 There a lion killed him and took the gem
 richon kaa raja jamvant us singh ko markar mani lekar gupha main chalaa gaya
 When Prasenjit did not return from hunting for several days, Satrajit felt very sad
 usne sochaa, shrikrishna ne hi mani praapt karne ke liye uskaa vadh kar diya hoga
 So, without gathering any kind of information, he preached that Shri Krishna killed Prasenjit and took away the Samantaka gem
 is lok-ninda ke nivaaran ke liye shrikrishna bahut se logon ke saath prasenjit ko dhundne van main gaye
 There, he got the symbols to kill Prasenjit by a lion and kill the lion by bear
 rich ke pairon kii khoj karte-karte ve jamvant kii gupha par pahunche or gupha ke bheetar chale gaye
 There he saw that the daughter of Jamwant is playing with that gem
 shrikrishna ko dekhte hi jamvant yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 War broke out
 gupha ke baahar shrikrishna ke saathiyon ne unki saat din tak pratiksha kii
 Then, repenting that they had died, they returned to Dwarikapuri
 idhar ikkis din tak lagaataar yuddh karne par bhi jamvant shrikrishna ko parajeet na kar sakaa
 Then he thought, is this avatar for which i got the blessing of Ramchandraji
 yah pushti hone par usne apni kanya kaa vivaah shrikrishna ke saath kar diya or mani dahej main de di
 When Shri Krishna came back with the gem, Satrajit was very ashamed of his actions
 is lajja se mukt hone ke liye usne bhi apni putree kaa vivaah shrikrishna ke saath kar diya
 After some time Sri Krishna went to Indraprastha for some work
 tab akrur tathaa ritu verma kii raay se shatadhanva ne satrajit ko markar mani apane kabje main le lee
 When Shri Krishna received the news of Satrajit's death, he immediately reached Dwarka
 ve shatadhanva ko markar mani chhinane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 Balaram was also ready to assist in this task
 yah jaanakar shatadhanva ne mani akrur ko de di or swayan bhaag niklaa
 Shri Krishna followed her and killed her, but Mani could not find them
 balraamji bhi vahaan pahunche
 Sri Krishna tells him that Mani is not near it
 balraamji ko vishwaas na hua
 Unhappy he went to Vidarbha
 shrikrishna ke dwarika lautne par logon ne unka baari apmaan kiya
 Immediately news spread that in the greed of Syamantak Mani, Shri Krishna also abandoned his brother
 shrikrishna is akaaran praapt apmaan ke shok main duube the ki sahasaa vahaan naradji aa gaye
 He told Shri Krishna ji - You saw the moon of Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi
 isi kaaran aapako is tarah laanchit hona padaa he
 Sri Krishna asked- What has happened to the moon of Chauth due to which a person is stained with his vision
 tab naradji bole- ek baar brahmaji ne chaturthi ke din ganeshji kaa vrath kiya tha
 When Ganeshji asked to ask for the groom, he asked that i should not be tempted to create the universe
 ganeshji jyon hi 'tathastu' kahkar chalane lage, unke vicitra vyaktitv ko dekhakar chandramaane uphaas kiya
 Ganeshji was angry at this and cursed the moon that from today no one would want to see your face
 shaap dekar ganeshji apane lok chale gaye or chandramaa maansarovar kii kumudiniyon main ja chipa
 Without the moon, the creatures suffered greatly
 unke ksht ko dekhakar brahmaji kii ajna se saare devataaon ke vrath se prasann hokar ganeshji ne vardaan diya ki ab chandramaa shaap se mukt to ho jayega, par bhadrapada shukla chaturthi ko jo bhi chandramaa ke darshan karegaa, use chori aadi kaa jhootha laanchhan jarur lagegaa
 But the person who continues to see every second, will be saved from this stigma
 is chaturthi ko siddhi vinayak vrath karne se saare dosha chhot jaayenge
 Hearing this, the gods went to their respective places
 is prakaar bhadrapada shukla chaturthi ko chandramaa kaa darshan karne se aapako yah kalank laga he
 Then Sri Krishna fasted to get rid of the stigma
 kurukshetra ke yuddh main yudhisthir ne bhagwaan shrikrishna se poocha- bhagwan! manushya kii manokamana siddhi kaa koun-sa upaay he? kis prakaar manushya dhan, putr, saubhaahgya tathaa vijay praapt kar saktaa he? yah sunakar shrikrishna ne uttar diya- yadi tum parvati putr shri ganesh kaa vidhipurvak pujan karo to nishchay hi tumhen sab kuch praapt ho jayega
 Then on the orders of Shri Krishna, Yudhishthiraji fasted Ganesh Chaturthi and won the war of Mahabharata
 yahi chaturth ganesh chaturthi naam se prasiddh he

 After Dow's death, William Peter Hamilton, Robert Rhea, and E
 George Shaffer organized and collectively introduced the Dow theory, based on Dow's editorial
 khud dou ne kabhi "dou siddhant" shabdaawalee kaa prayog nahin kiya tha or na hi use ek trading pranali ke rup main prastut kiya
 Six basic elements of the Dow theory summarized by Hamilton, Rhea, and Shaffer are described below
 dou siddhant kii laabhakarita ke liye shaikshanik samarthan adhik nahin he
 Alfred Cowles, in a 1934 Econometrica study, showed that trading based on editorial advice yields lower earnings than a by-and-hold strategy using a better-divided portfolio
 couls ne nishkarsh nikaala ki kharido-or-rakho ranneeti ne 1902-1929 se 15
5% vaarshik munaafe ko utpann kiya, jabaki dou siddhant ranneeti ne 12% ke vaarshik munaafe ko utpann kiya
 In later years, with many studies supporting Cowles, many academics stopped reading the Dow theory, believing that Cowles' results were conclusive
 tathaapi, haal ke varshon main, couls ke nishkarshon par dobaaraa gaur kiya gaya he
 William Goetzman, Stephen Brown, and Alok Kumar believe that Cowl's study was incomplete and that the Dow theory generates risk-adjusted excessive profits
 vishesh rup se, kharido-or-rakho ranneeti kaa munaafaa dou siddhant portpholio kii tulana main 2% adhik tha, lekin dou siddhant portpholio kaa jokhim or asthirataa kam thi, jiske chalate dou siddhant portpholio ne, unke adhyayan ke anusaar ucch jokhim-samyojit munaafaa pradaan kiya
 Nevertheless, adjusting profits for risk is controversial in the context of the Dow theory
 dou siddhant ke kisi bhi vishleshan ke saath mukhya samasya yah he ki charles dou ke sampadakeey spasht rup se paribhaashit nivesh "niyamon" ko nahin bataate, isliye kuch anumaanon or vyakhyaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Many technical analysts believe that the definition of trend given by the Dow theory and the emphasis on the study of price activity are the basis of modern technical analysis

 In addition to maintenance, which costs between $ 75–100 a season, the breed needs to be continually strengthened with daily exercise and positive training techniques

 Due to this genetic condition, the hair of the dog is short

 ve bahut jaldi sikh jaaya karte hai, maano prashikshan main unhen majaa aata ho or ve vastuon ke naam lambey samay tak yaad rakh sakate hai

 Some pwds stand upright on the kitchen counter and table, especially after finding the aroma of the food
 is aadat ko "counter surfing" ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah is nasl kii visheshta he
 Although this can be a type of disturbance, many PWD owners enjoy watching their dogs walk, jump, stand or "countering" and do not seriously discourage their activities
 haalanki ve logon ke bahut achche saathi hote hai kyonki ve unki jaruraton ko samajha karte hai, lekin portugali samudri kute har kisi ke liye nahin hote

 lekin uskaa uddeshy puraa nahin ho sakaa tha
 His manner of functioning was faulty

 Hence, it failed to solve the problems
 vienna sammelan kaa kaarykram swaarth parata par aadhaarit tha
 Its members expected moral principles
 is liye iske nirnay asthaayee anirthak sabit hue
 It did not make any effort in the new construction of Europe to fulfill the wishes of the people and to establish a permanent system

 kuch itihaaskaaron ne vienna congress ko pratikrayavaadi kaha he
 There was no cost to the national sentiment for this, it is also alleged that the interests of small nations were neglected to protect the interests of big nations

 France was treated fairly fairly in the Vienna Congress and was represented in the Congress despite being a defeated power, while defeated Germany was not represented in the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, and strict provisions of the treaty were imposed on it
