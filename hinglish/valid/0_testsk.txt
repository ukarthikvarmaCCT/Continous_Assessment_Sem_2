 Since platelet rash can become large enough to cause blockage in the bloodstream at or near that location, the use of aspirin in people with a high risk of developing blood clots in small amounts for long-term heart attacks, brain- It is also used to prevent stroke and blood clots
 yah bhi paaya gaya he ki hridayaghat ke turant baad thodi maatra main aspirin dekar ek or hridayaghat yaa hriday ke utak kii mrityu kaa jokham kam kiya ja saktaa he

 Aspirin is the first member of a class called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, not all of which are salicylates, although they all have a similar effect and mostly inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase
 aaj, aspirin duniya kii sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali aushadhiyon main se ek he, jisaki anumaanit 40,000 ton maatra prativarsh khai jaati he
 In countries where aspirin is a registered trademark of Bayer, its generic name is acetyl salicylic acid
 ek french chemist, charles fredrick jerheart ne pehali baar 1853 main acetilaselicylic acid banaai
 During his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides he mixed acetyl chloride with sodium salts of salicylic acid
 ek joardaar pratikriya hui or pighla hua yogic jaldi hi jam kar thos main parinit ho gaya
 Since there was no compositional theory in those days, Gerhardt named the compound salicylic-acetic anhydride
 
 aspirin kaa yah utpaadan jerheart dwaara enhydron par uske paper ke liye kii gai anek pratikriyaaon main se ek tha or usne iske aage or kuch nahin kiya
 After six years, in 1859 von Gillam obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid by reaction of salicylic acid and acetal chloride
 1869 main, shrouyder, prinzharn or crot ne jerheart or won gilm, donon ke sanshlepanon ko dobaaraa kiya or bataaya ki in donon pratikriyaaon se ek hi yogic –acetile salicylic acid praapt hota he
 He first demonstrated its correct composition — as an acetyl group linked to phenolic oxygen
 1897 main, aushadhi or daai kii form bear ke vaigyanikon ne acetile salicylic acid ke un dinon aam salicyllette davaaiyon ke kam-vikshobhak pratisthaapan ke rup main jaanch shuru kii
 By 1899, Bayer had named it aspirin and began selling it worldwide
 aspirin naam acetile or spirsor–salicylic acid kaa ek purana naam – se praapt kiya gaya he
 Aspirin's popularity increased in the twentieth century due to its potential impact in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic
 lekin haal main kiye gaye shodh se lagata he ki 1918 ke flu main adhik mrityu dar kuch had tak aspirin ke kaaran thi, kyonki us samay prayukt aspirin kii maatra vishaaktata, fefdon main drav or kuch maamalon main dwitiyak bacteria sankraman utpann kar sakati he or ghaatak ho sakati he
 The benefits from aspirin created intense competition, and many brands and products went on the market, especially after the 1917 US patent expired
 1956 main paracitamaal or 1969 main ibuprophen ke bazaar main aane ke baad aspirin kii lokapriyata ghatane lagi
 John Wayne and others discovered a baseline process of aspirin's effects in the 1960s and 1970s, while clinical discoveries and other studies have shown an anti-clotting effect of aspirin to reduce the risk of clotting diseases
 beesvin sadi ke antim dashakon main aspirin kii bikri hridayaghat or mastishkaghat kii rokthaam ke liye uske vyapak prayog ke kaaran phir se kaaphi bad gai

 Aspirin is one of the main drugs used to treat migraine, which provides relief in 50–60% of cases
 yah nai trypton dawa sumatripton or anya dardanivaarakon jaise paracitamaal yaa ibuprophen jitani hi asarkaarak he
 The combination of aspirin, paracetamol and caffeine is even more effective
 migraine sirdard ke liye yah formula apane teenon anshon ko alag-alag lene se behatar, or ibuprophen va sumatripton se bhi behatar kaam karata he
 As with other migraine treatments, aspirin is recommended to be taken as soon as the first symptoms of a headache begin, and in comparative clinical studies, these medicines were also given
 praasangik tanaav sirdardon main aspirin 60-75% rogiyon kaa dard dur karti he
 From this point of view, except for the excess of side effects in the stomach and intestines, it is equivalent to paracetamol
 tulanaatmak naidanik adhyayanon main paaya gaya ki metamizol or ibuprophen aspirin kii banisbat adhik teji se dard se raahat laa sakate hai, lekin yah antar kareeb 2 ghanton baad naganya ho jaataa he
 When the aspirin is added to 60–130 mg of caffeine, the pain-relieving effect is increased in the headache
 aspirin, paracitamaal or caffeine kaa sanyog or bhi asarkaari hota he lekin adhik pet kii takalif, ghabrahat or chakkar aate hai
 Aspirin generally works well in mild, pulsating pain
 yah adhikansh mansapeshiyon kii anthnon, pet phoolne, athreey failaav or twachaa ke kshobh se hue dardon main asarkaari nahin hoti
 sabase adhik adhyayan kiya gaya dard kaa udhaaharan shalyakriya ke baad kaa dard jaise daant nikaalane ke baad kaa dard he, jiske liye aspirin kii sabase adhik anumatipraapt maatra 1 gram paracitamaal, 60 migra kodin or 5 migra oxycodon ke baraabar hoti he
 The combination of aspirin and caffeine provides more relief from pain than aspirin alone
 eparvescent aspirin goliyon vaali aspirin se adhik teji se dard kam karti he
 Nevertheless, aspirin is less effective than ibuprofen as a pain reliever used after surgery
 aspirin ke kaaran ibuprophen kii apeksha adhik amashay va aanton main vishaaktata hoti he
 The maximum amount of aspirin has less pain relieving than the moderate amount of ibuprofen, and this relief persists for less than that
 aspirin or kodin ke sanyog main akele aspirin se jaraa si adhik dardanivaaran kii kshamta hoti he, lekin naidanik rup se yah antar adhik myne nahin rakhata
 aisa lagata he ki ibuprophen kam se kam is sanyog ke baraabar, yaa sambhawatah adhik asardaar hota he
 According to an analysis of clinical studies for menstrual pain, aspirin was found to be more effective than placebo but less effective than ibuprofen or naproxen, although maximum doses of aspirin were never used in these studies
 lekhakon ne paaya ki ibuprophen main sabase acha jokham-laabh anupaat he
 Aspirin did not relieve pain during a cycling workout, while surprisingly caffeine was very effective
 isi tarah, kasarat ke baad peshiyon main hone vaale dard main aspirin, kodin yaa paracitamaal plasibo se behatar nahin thim
 There are two clear uses of aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events - primary prevention and secondary prevention
 Primary prevention is related to reduction of stroke and stroke in people who have never diagnosed heart or duct problems
 dwitiyak rokthaam pehle se hradvahini se sambandhit rogon se grast logon se sambandh rakhti he
 Aspirin is recommended in small amounts for secondary prevention of strokes and heart attacks
 hradvahini ke rogon se nidaan hue purushon or mahilaon donon main aspirin hridayaghat or rakt pravaah ke avaruddha hone se hone vaale mastishakaghat kii sambhaavna 20 pratishat tak kam kar detii he
 This means a reduction in the ultimate rate of such incidents in people already suffering from cardiovascular diseases from 8
2% to 6
7% per year
 haalanki aspirin raktasrav se hone vaale mastishakaghat or anya bade rakthasraavon ke jokham ko doguna kar detii he, aisi ghatnaayen but kam hoti hai or aspirin ke prabhaav kul mila kar sakaaratmak hote hai
 Thus, secondary prevention studies reduced aspirin mortality by 10 percent
 aise logon main jo hradvahinirogon se grast nahin hai, aspirin ke laabh spasht nahin hai
 In primary prevention experiments, aspirin decreased the overall incidence of stroke and reduced blood flow by 10 percent
 lekin, chunki ye ghatnaayen viral hai, unki dar main param kami kam thi-0
57% se 0
51% prativarsh
 iske alaava, rakthasravik mastishkaghat or amashay va aanton ke raktasrav ke jokham aspirin ke phaaydon ko lagbhag puri tarah se naganya vana dete hai
 Thus, aspirin did not reduce overall mortality in primary prevention experiments
 These topics continue to be discussed and debated in the scientific community
 praathmik rokthaam ke liye aspirin ke prayog ke bare main visheshgy sansthaaon kii raay main bhinnata he
 The US Government Preventive Services Task Force recommends making specific choices in each case based on the perceived future risk and patient choice

 aspirin or paracitamaal main, sivaay adhik pasinaa aane or pet par dushprabhavon ke kisi bhi pahalu se fark nahin tha
 Acute rheumatic fever fever and joint pain decrease very well, often within three days, when given large amounts of aspirin
 yah upachaar 1-2 hafton tak diya jaataa he or keval 5% maamalon main yah chah maheenon se adhik tak chaalu rahata he
 Aspirin does not require treatment after fever and pain have subsided because it does not reduce the incidence of heart problems and rheumatic heart disease
 iske atirikt, aspirin kii adhik matraaon se kareeb 20% bacchon, jo rumetic fever ke adhikansh rogi hote hai, main yakrut main vishaaktata utpann ho jaati he or unamem reiz syndrome hone kaa jokham bad jaataa he
 Naproxen has been found to be as effective as aspirin but less toxic, but due to limited clinical experience, naproxen has been recommended as a second-line treatment
 rumetic fever ke alaava, bacchon main kawasaki rog main aspirin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, haalanki kuch lekhakon ne is prayog par bhi prashnchinh lagaaya he

 PTGS2 normally produces prostenoids, which are mostly inflammatory
 aspirin dwaara sanshodhit pitijies2 lypoxinon kaa utpaadan karata he, jo adhikanshtah shothavirohi hote hai
 New NSAID drugs have been developed called PTGS2 selective inhibitors that only inhibit PTGS2, with the aim of reducing gastrointestinal side effects
 lekin, vayaks jaise anek nae ko haal hi main waapas le liya gaya he kyonki aise saboot mili hai ki pitijies2 avarohak hridayaghat ke khatre ko badhaate hai
 It has been stated that the endothelial cells present in the inner layers of the fine blood vessels of the body produce PTGS2 and specifically inhibition of PTGS2 leads to downregulation of prostaglandin production against thromboxane, as PTGS1 is unaffected in platelets
 isse, pijiai2 kaa rakshaatmak skandanvirohi asar hat jaataa he, jisase thrambas or uske saath hridayaghaton or anya raktapravaah kii samasyaon kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Because platelets do not contain DNA, they cannot synthesize new PTGS once aspirin is irreversibly inhibited by the enzyme, a significant differentiation from variable inhibitors of aspirin

 Aspirin displaces many drugs in the blood from their hostages, including anti-diabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, immunosuppressant methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid, and all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
 carticostirid bhi aspirin kii sandratha ko kam kar sakate hai
 The pharmacological activity of spironolactone can also be reduced by taking aspirin and aspirin competes with penicillin g for secretion from the kidneys
 aspirin vitamin si ke avasorana main bhi baadha daalati he
 Aspirin is used in veterinary medicine, primarily for the treatment of pain and joint inflammation in dogs, although it is not often recommended, as new medicines with less side effects are available for these animals
 udhaaharan ke liye, kutton main salicylleton se sambandhit jathrantriy dushprabhav vishesh taur par hote hai
 Horses are also given aspirin for pain relief, although it is not generally recommended due to its short-term analgesic effect

 Nevertheless, in most cases of laminitis, its use as an anticoagulant has proved beneficial
 pashuon main aspirin kaa prayog pashuchikitsak ke nirikshan main hi karnaa chaiye
 Aspirin should never be given to cats because they do not have the ability to form glucuronide conjugates, which increases the likelihood of aspirin becoming toxic
 vishaaktata ko khuraaqon ke bich adhik samyaantar rakh kar kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Aspirin is an acetyl compound derived from salicylic acid which is a white, crystal-like, lightly acidic substance with a melting point of 135 ° C
 it happens
 acetile salicylic acid ammonium acitate yaa kshareey dhaatuon ke aceteton, carboneton, citreton yaa hydraxidon ke gholon main teji se vighatit hota he
 Acetyl salicylic acid remains stable in dry air, but is slowly hydrolyzed to acetic and salicylic acids when conjugated to humidity
 kshaaron ke saath gholon main, hydrolysis teji se hoti he or isse praapt saaf ghol puri tarah se acitate or salicyllette yukt ho sakate hai
 Synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction

 Some Upanishads are considered portions of 'brahman' and 'aranyak' texts
 inkaa rachanakaal samhitaon ke baad kaa he
 There is no definite opinion about the period of the Upanishads, the period of the general Upanishads is believed to have been composed from 3000 BC to 500 BC upanishdon ke kaal-nirnay ke liye nimna mukhya tathyon ko aadhaar mana gaya he— The composition of the various Upanishads has been considered by the following scholars in the following order: nardapariwrajakopenishad atharvavedic shakha ke antargat ek upanishad he
 This Upanishad is written in Sanskrit language
 iske rachiyata vaidic kaal ke rishiyon ko mana jaataa he parantu mukhyat vedavyas ji ko kai upanishdon kaa lekhak mana jaataa he
 There is no opinion of scholars regarding the creation of Upanishads

 varun hindu dharm ke ek pramukh devtaa hai
 His place in the ancient Vedic religion was very important, but his form in the Vedas is so abstract that its natural depiction is difficult
 mana jaataa he ki varun kii sthiti anya vaidic devataaon kii apeksha pracheen he, isiilie vaidic yug main varun kisi prakritik upadan kaa vaachak nahin he
 The amount of hymns addressed to Varuna is much less than that of Agni and Indra, yet its importance is not less
 indra ko mahaan yoddha ke rup main janaa jaataa he to varun ko naitik shakti kaa mahaan poshak mana gaya he, vah rut kaa poshak he

 For example, in the seventh mandala of the Rigveda, beautiful prayer songs are found for Vasana
 unako "asur" kii upadhi di gayi thi, matlab kii wo "dev" devataaon ke samooh se alag the
 He was considered to have magical power, whose name was Maya
 unako itihaaskaar maanate hai ki asur varun hi parsi dharm main "ahura mazda" kehalaae
 In later mythology, Varuna was made a minor water god
 vyatireki bhashavigyaan bhashaa-shikshan kaa vyavhaarik tarika he jo kisi bhashaa-yugma ke samaantaaon evam antaron kaa varnan karke bhashaa ko sugam banane par jor detaa he
 This is why it is sometimes called interlanguage
 vyatireki bhashavigyaan kaa udai dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay sainikon ko un deshon kii bhashaayen, jahaan ve ladane ja rahe the, sikhaane ke uddeshy se hua
 Linguists were asked to prepare teaching materials for learning and teaching the languages there in the shortest possible time
 isi avadhi main america main kai jatiyon ke or kii bhashaaon ko bolne vaale log aakar basane lage the
 There was a demand for all those people to learn and teach English
 in donon maangon kii purti main bhashavigyaniyon ko kai bhinn-bhinn bhashaaon ke adhyayan or vishleshan ke saath-saath unki shikshan-saamagree kaa nirmaan karnaa padaa
 As a result, the idea of making the teaching materials of the courses of schools also arose
 in sabake pariprekshya main `bhashashikshan main bhashavigyaan ke anuprayog paksh' par joro se kaam hone laga
 The increasing demand for other-language teaching has given rise to heteronormativity
 vyatireki bhashavigyaan kaa itihaas bahut hi alp samay kaa he, keval pachchis-tees varsh kaa
 Two American linguists are credited with developing the linguistics as a systematic branch
 ve hai - charles si freez or rabart ledo
 Robert Laddow's book, Linguistics Across Cultures, published in 1957, is the shape of the linguistic science of the individual
 inhen dinon anya bhashaaon ko sikhaate hue bhashavigyaniyon ne mahasoos kiya ki anya bhashaa seekhney vaala kuch aisi bhashaa bolta yaa likhata he jo sikhi jane vaali bhashaa ke anurup nahin hoti
 There can be two reasons for this: yaa to usne us bhashaa ke niyamon ko galat tareeke se siikhaa he or Or he has not yet mastered those rules
 in dharanaon ne teen vichaaron ko janm diya-- If other language teaching is done in the right direction and with scientific methods, the learner can use the language according to the rules of that language
 anya bhashaa main seekhney waalon kii jo trutiyaan hoti hai, ve is baat ko sanketit karti hai ki seekhney vaale ko kuch sthalon main kathinaaiyaan hoti hai
 These can be called sites of difficulty or problematic sites
 kathinaaiyon ke sthal praaia: ve hi hote hai jo seekhney vaale kii maatrubhaasha or sikhaayi jane vaali bhashaa kii sanrachana main antar yaa bhinnata ke sthal hai
 The above ideas strengthened the foundations of individual linguistics
 vyatireki bhashavigyaan kii mul sthapanaayen hai :-- anya bhashaa shikshan main saralata or kathinaayee kii vyakhya seekhney vaale kii strot bhashaa or lakshya bhashaa kii vyatireki tulana main he
 The most effective teaching material for other language teaching is that which is prepared by analyzing the parallel scientific contrast of the learner's source language and target language and selecting and following the textual points
 jo shikshak shikshaarthi kii strot bhashaa tathaa lakshya kii vaigyanik vidhi se tulana karne kii kshamta rakhata he vah, shikshaarthi kii shikshan-samasyaon ko behatar dhang se samaj saktaa he or unka behatar samaadhaan prastut kar saktaa he
 Two years after the publication of Robert Ledo's book, the 'center for Applied Linguistics of the Modern Language Association' was established in Washington, with a series of 'analysis' of the heterogeneous analysis of the structures of various major languages with English
 ab to america ke atirikt britain or lagbhag sabhi europee deshon main vyatireki adhyayan kai staron par prastut kiya ja rahaa he
 Here are the aims set by the organizers of the Romanian project, the romanian-english Contértés Enalesis project of Romania: - "to present the comparison of the sound system, grammar, vocabulary and writing arrangements of the two languages
 is tulana kaa uddeshy donon bhashaaon main vidyaman aisi sanrachanagat samaantaaon or asamantaaon par prakaash daalana jo donon bhashaaon ke seekhney vaale main manovaigyanik ulajhanein paidaa kar detii hai
 Invention of teaching methods and making useful sample material based on the findings of this project
 is nirmaan kaary main in nishkarshon ke anuprayog kaa pareekshan karnaa
 Creating qualified material to provide guidance for those working in this direction in the future
 "the linguistics of the individual is focused on the simultaneous structures of two languages in such a way or the simultaneous structures of two languages in this The contrast should be presented in such a way that the similarities and differences or differences existing in the two languages are clearly revealed
 iske aadhaar par jo nishkarsh saamne aayenge unki sahaayta se bhashaa sikhte samay hone vaali trutiyon kaa anumaan lagaaya ja sakegaa
 Using this approach of contrast analysis, we can be aware of the kind of errors a person with a linguistic background can make and what solutions can be taken to correct or minimize those errors
 is tarah saidhantik rup se sujhaaye gayi samaadhaanon kaa pareekshan vastav main kakshadhyaapan ke samay hi sambhav ho saktaa he
 In reality, we often see that one of the two students with the same linguistic background replaces one element in the same place instead of one element, while the other student replaces it
 at: kaksha main in nishkarshon kaa punarikshan aavashyak he
 Robert Ledo, the proponent of contrast analysis, has rightly stated in his book that the problems listed by contrast analysis are approximate
 inkaa pramanikaran chaatro ke bhashaayi prayogon ke sandarbh main jaanch ke baad kiya jaataa he
 We have seen above that individualism's linguistics is a hybrid or mixed linguistic enterprise, which in addition to linguistics is also related to social science and psychology
 chunki vyatireki vishleshan anya bhashaa shikshan ke saath judaa hua he or bhashashikshan adhigam-prakriya par nirbhar he at: vyatireki bhashavigyaan manovaigyanik aadhaar / yaa ghatak kii apeksha rakhata he
 There are mainly two schools in promotion under Learning Psychology: - vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan or Organic or cognitive psychology
 vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan main adhigam do tattvon ke sansarg se sambandh rakhata he :- uddipan / uttejnaa or anukriya
 Under Behavioral Psychology, these two elements of learning were presented by Thorndike in relation to the theory of affiliation, Watson, Powlava, etc
, and the concept of Reinforcement Theory by Skinner
 saamaanya, saral or moort vastuon, anubhavon, pratyayon or kriyaaon ke adhigam ke sandarbh main jaanwaron par kiye gayi prayogon kaa vistaran manovigyaniyon ne ise bhashaa adhigam par lagu kiya
 The speech that the speaker pronounces when stimulated or stimulated by environmental conditioning will be considered a response
 duusare shabdon main `vyakti jin abhipraayon ko abhivyakt karnaa chahta he unhen `u' or sambhddha bhashaayi sanketon main unka sanketan karnaa `a' kehalaayegaa
 'A' listener of the speaker
 bhashavigyaniyon ke vichaar main bhashaa ek saamaajik vyavhaar he
 It is habit-controlled behavior that is the result of a series of stimuli and responses
 bhashaa ke vishleshan kaa taatpary he in aadat-niyantrit vyavhaaron ke uccharon kaa vishleshan
 The installations that behavioral psychology has made in relation to learning are empirical and empirical
 isliye inhen prayogashrith yaa anubhavashrith bhi kaha jaataa he
 The fallacy of theory depends on the validity of experiences and experiments
 vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan se sambhddha bhashavaigyanik vichaar-dhara ko vargiki vichaardhaara kehete hai
 Structural linguistics is associated with it
 sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaani, anubhavjanya pareekshan ko pramanit maanane ke kaaran avlokan yogya bhashaayi tattvon par nirbhar rahete hai
 Any structure devoid of physical fact or truth is meaningless for them to study
 isliye martin zeus kehete hai dimag ke liye aisi agamya bhashaayi ikaayiyon ke bare main anumaan lagane kaa hamen koi adhikaar nahin he, ye agamya hai
 While presenting the description of the language, our attention should only go to the observed linguistic facts
 yah vichaardhaara bhashaa kii ek hi sanrachana : upari sanrachana ko hi maanati he, at: sanrachana ko nahin
 This ideology considers language as habit-controlled behavior and proposes its learning as a habit-forming process
 avyavvaadi yaa sangyanatmak manovigyaan adhigam-pratyayon main antardrushti ke siddhant kaa pratipaadan karata he
 This learning has more relation to abstract suffixes and is called complex learning
 bhavatmak pratyayon kii adhikta se yukt is adhigam main maanav apane mastishk kii sarjanshiltaa ke kaaran antardrushti ko saath liye pratyayon / vastuon kaa samanyikaran evam vibhedikaran karata hua aatmsaat kar letaa he
 According to the ideas expressed by associating language-learning with elemental psychology, the human brain, by virtue of its amazing capacity, keeps linguistic power within itself
 is simit samaarthy ko sarjanaatmak pratibha ke kaaran niyam-niyantrit asankhya bhashaayi sanrachanaon ko nishpadit karata he
 The linguistic ideology associated with fundamentalist psychology is called the product stream of thought
 is vichaar dhara ke anusaar sara brahmad rup or padaarth se bana he or inase prabhavit he
 The human soul is also full of body and brain
 in donon ke sahasambandh or antar ko in udaahranon : hamaare kathan or hamaare chintan ke pariprekshya main samajha ja saktaa he
 Language is the property of human beings only
 is vazah se bhashaa main jahaan ek ore sharir-abhimukh rup he to duusari ore mastishk abhimukh padaarth he
 In fact, these are the two structures: overhead structure and internal structure
 mastishk-padaarth hone ke naate isamen bhashaayi samarthy he to sharir-abhimukh padaarth hone ke naate isamen bhashaayi nishpaadan he
 The view expressed by this ideology in the context of the language-learning process is visible

 By the way, this scheme is not really linguistic
 lekin phir bhi uskaa prakatikaran bhashik sanketon evam vyavasthaaon main hota he

 Using this limited knowledge, the speaker generates unlimited sounds and the listener understands

 According to this view, language is rule-controlled behavior and its learning is related to cognitive processes
 avyavvaadi manovigyaan se sambhddha bhashavaigyanikon ne yah ghoshnaa karke ki `bhashaa na aadat kii sanrachana he or na aadatanirmaan prakriya', vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan ke adhigam se sambhddha, abhyanukulan or punarbalan siddhanton par prashn chinh laga diye
 Nevertheless, habit formation has its own importance in the language-learning process
 vyavhaar-vaadi or avyavvaadi donon main adhigam ke sambandh main paraspar virdohi maton kii asweekaar karte hue costler ke kathan ko uddhrut karte hue aar
 hok kehete hai ki adhigam chaahe vah bhaavnaatmak ho, gatik ho yaa sangyanatmak ek baar adhigamit hokar nishpadit ho jaataa he to duusari baar aasaani se nishpadit kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, habit formation has its own importance
 lekin donon vichaardhaaraon kii upapattiyon kaa samanvay karte hue jaan bi
 karol kehete hai ki niyam-niyantrit vyavhaar or aadat-niyantrit vyavhaar ye donon paraspar virdohi nahin hai, kyonki bhashaa-niyam vastav main bhashaa-aadat ke hi varnan prastut karte hai or ham niyamon ke sachetan anuprayog se aadat tak pahunch sakate hai
 Similar idea with noted Russian psychologist A
 a
 Leontov has revealed that 'simulation can result in habit-forming and / or as a result of automation and captivation / conversion of knowledge
 pehle ko `aadat-nirmaan kii arohan prakriya' or duusare ko `avarohan prakriya' kah sakate hai 
' sherwood smit ne `sangyanatmak manovigyaan sammat anuprayukt bhashavigyaan' naamak apane lekh main kaha he ki sangyanatmak manovigyaan ke dwaara sweekrut do pramukh siddhanton main se ek yah he ki nayaa gyaan chaahe maatraatmak drushti se kam ho yaa zyada, puraane gyaan ke madhyam se hi grahan kiya ja saktaa he
 The associated structures for cognitive learning learning can also be organized in such a way that they can be easily taught and learned
 arthath sangyanatmak manovigyaan kii drushti se bhi vyatireki vishleshan kii upyogita ko anya bhashaa shikshan main asweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Along with language-learning theories, learning transfer theories also have great importance that provide a psychological basis for individual linguistics
 `baad main siikhe jane vaale kaary par pehle se siikhe hue kaary kaa kya parinaam padataa he' yah adhigam manovigyaan ke antargat ek mukhya vishay he
 The effects of the previously learned work on the task to be learned later give rise to the 'transfer concept'
 siikhe hue kisi gyaan ko anya samaan paristhitiyon athwa jivan ke anya kshetron main upyog main laana hi antaran he
 Under Behavioral Learning Psychology, Thorndike's articulated transfer theory is known as the 'principle of common elements' and the transfer theory formulated under organistic learning psychology is known as the 'principle of territorial completeness'
 samaan tattvon ke siddhant ke anusaar purvarjit gyaan yaa anubhav se nayaa gyaan yaa anubhav jitna adhik samaan hoga utani hi maatra main antaran hota he or jitne ansh main yah visham hoga utani hi maatra main nakaaratmak yaa shunya antaran hota he
 According to the principle of regional completeness, learning is the inspection, testing and acquiring of direct knowledge
 elice antaran ke bare main kehete hai ki shiksha ke siddhant evam prayog ke kshetra main sambhavat: antaran hi ek aisi sankalpana he jo adhik mahatvapurn role adaa karti he
 The relationship that is learned in school is relevant in later years of life
 antaran main bhrasht evam duragrohi ke rup main aksar dekha jaataa he ki jo baad ke adhigam main avrodh prastut karata he
 But it can also be helpful, such as helping to improve speech writing skills
 pehali sthiti ko avrodh / nakaaratmak antaran kehete hai to duusari sthiti ko sukarta / sahuuliyat yaa sakaaratmak antaran kehete hai to duusari sthiti ko sukarta / sahuliyat yaa sakaaratmak antaran kehete hai
 These conditions have also been termed as pre-emptive or pre-emptive intervention / trauma and regressive or post-rejection intervention

 There is a book in Harshacharita Sanskrit composed by Banabhatta
 isamen bhartiya samraat harshavardhan kaa jeevancharit varnit he
 It is the oldest Sanskrit book related to historical plot
 is samay uplabdh harshcharit aath uchhvaason main vibhajit he
 The first two and a half sighs are in the form of Baan's autobiography
 taduparant sthanishwar ke punyabhuti vansh, jinamein harsh ke pita prabhakarvardhan kaa janm hua tha, kaa varnan he
 Baan has described the marriage of Prabhakarvardhan's daughter Rajyashree and Kannaujadhipati Grahavarma Maukhari
 apane jyeshtha putr rajvardhan ko hunon kaa hanan karne ke liye bhejkar prabhakarvardhan jvergrast ho gaye
 Baan has described his illness, death, cremation and self-immolation of the Empress Yashomati
 tabhi goud evam maalav senaaon ke kannauj par akraman tathaa grahaverma kii hatya kii soochna milti he yah sunakar rajyavardhan kannauj kii ore bade
 The enemies laid down their arms
 parantu chaalaaki kheli
 Rajyavardhan was invited to the enemy camp and brutally murdered
 harsh ne apane bahanoi evam bhai kii hatya kaa badla lene kii pratigya kii tathaa kannauj kii ore prasthaan kiya
 The enemy fled in front of Harsha's growing army
 yah sunakar harsh ke vismay kaa ant na tha ki rajyashri kaid se chhootakar vindhyachal kii ore chali gai
 After much diligent search, Harsha, eager to commit self-immolation, found Rajyashree near the ashram of friend Rishi and brought him to his camp on the banks of the Ganges
 yahan granth aksmaat samaapt ho jaataa he
 It is said that Baan's idea was not to completely write the character of Harsha
 vah iskaa keval maatr eiansh likhnaa chaahate the kyonki unhone apane shrotaaon ko batalaaya he ‘harsh ke jivan kaa varnan’ saikadon jiwanon main bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If you want to hear a part of it, then i am ready
 yah bhi thik hi kaha jaataa he ki ‘harshcharit’ harsh ke jivan kii keval ek ghatana maatr he kyonki harsh charit se uplabdh aitihaasik gyaan bahut hi kam he
 But while criticizing this book, we should not see it as a historical work
 vastutah use aitihaasik kathanak se yukt ek kavy kahana hi adhik yuktisangat he
 The author's full power is focused on showcasing poetic talent and historicity is secondary to him
 unhone kriti ke pratinayak bhoot goud evam maalav raajaaon kaa naam bhi nahin diya he
 Even after the determination to make the land void of the Gaudas, Baan has left the future events of the Gaudas
 jahaan pathak vindhyaparvat main se harsh kii gaveshna ke parinaam ko sunne ko utkanthit hai vahaan baan vindhyaparvat kaa sookshm varnan karne main sanlagn hai
 Astu, Baan have presented a beautiful picture of Harsha's departing army, Rajya Sabha, religious sects, villages, which is very important from the point of view of history

 emeter yaa 'emmapi' kisi paripath kii kisi shakha main bahane vaali vidyut dhara ko maapne vaala yantra he
 The devices used to measure very small currents are called "millimeter" or "micrometer"
 ameter kii sabase puraani dizin di'arsonal kaa dharamapi yaa chalit kundalee dharamapi tha
 In 1820, the ampere invented that if a conductor, in which current flows, is placed in a magnetic field, then a force acts on it
 is bal kaa maan chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata, dharaman or chaalak kii lambaai ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 The direction of this force is determined by Fleming's left-hand law
 apane baayein haath kaa angutha, uske paas kii ungali or bich kii ungali madhyamaa kaa is prakaar failaayen ki ve teenon ek duusare ke lamberup rahen
 If the index finger points in the direction of the magnetic field and the median in the direction of the current, then the speed of the conductor will be in the direction of the thumb
 chumbakeey kshetra main rakhi hui kisi kundali main jab vidyutdhara pravaahit hoti he, to kundali par ek balyugma kaary karne lagata he, jisus vah ghoomane lagati he
 The dharmapi that have been made by using this principle, they are called chalakunda dharamapi
 isamen ek ytaakar kundali hoti he, jisamen patale or vidyutrodhit taanbe ke taar ke bahut chakkar hote hai
 This coil is hung with a screw by a very thin leaf of phosphor brange, one end of the coil is attached to this leaf and the leaf is connected to a connective screw of the dielectric
 is pattee main ek vrittakar samtal yaa natodar darpan bhi laga rahata he, jo pattee ke saath saath ghumta he
 The second end of the coil is connected to a spiral spring of metal, which is connected to the second connective screw

 The poles of the magnet are curved in concave cylindrical shape

 All these items are kept locked in an non-magnetic box
 baks ke saamne ke bhaag main kaanch laga rahata he, jisase darpan kaa vikshep lamp tathaa paimaana vidhi se napa ja sake
 When electric current flows in the coil, a force act on the two arms of the coil and rotate the coil from its position, causing a spasm in the phosphor brange leaf and the downward spiral spring and a twitch force pair
 But starts working in the opposite direction
 jisase kundali sheeghra hi santulan main aa jaati he
 If the coil has a deflection angle, the current comes from the following formula: arthath dharaman vikshep kone kaa samaanupati hota he
 These thermometers are very stable and suitable sensitizers
 inase 10-10 ampiore tak kii dhara naapi ja sakati he
 There are mainly two types of magnetoscope
 isamen kundali ek dhaatu ke dhaanche par lapet di jaati he, jisase dhara pravaahit hone par kundali vikshepit ho sheeghra sthir ho jaati he
 As the coil rotates, vortex currents arise in it and its metal structure and stop the coil
 kundali dolan nahin karti, isi se is yantra ko mrit-spand kehete hai
 The horoscope reaches its former position as soon as the current is removed
 atev dhara kaa maan kundali kii purvasthiti tathaa dhara pravaahit hone par kii sthiti ke gyaan se badi saralata se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 In this currentometer, the coil is tied on a dielectric structure and due to this, there is no vortex current in it
 at: kundali ke vikshep main bahut kam pratirodh padataa he
 The coil oscillates on both sides of its deflection when the current is not flowing through the metal structure
 yah ati sookshmagrahi hota he or kshanik aavesh ko bhi badi sugamawapurv isse ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 These are of two types: attractors and repulsors
 vidyutrodhi taron kii ek sthir kundali se yadi vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, to kundali ke bich main or aasapaas main bhi chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 If a piece of cast iron is hung near this horoscope, it gets attracted towards the coil
 is lohe ke tukade main agar ek sanketak laga ho, to sanketak bhi vikshepit ho jayega
 If there is such a mechanism that it can be brought to equilibrium by applying force opposite to the attraction force on the piece of iron, then the value of the current will be known by the deflection of the indicator
 bahudhaa ek sarpil kamaani dwaara is aakarshanabal kaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 The force of attraction is proportional to the square of the current-value
 isliye sanketak kaa vikshep bhi dhara maan ke varg ke samaanupati hoga
 For this reason, it can also find the value of alternating current
 vidyutarodhi taron ke kai chakkaaron kii sthir kundali ke bich, do naram lohe ke patale chad kundali ke aksh ke samaantar lage hai
 One rod is fixed, the other is connected to an indicator which is mounted on a nail itself
 sanketak kaa doosraa sira ek dial par ghumta he
 When the current flows in the coil, both rods become the same type of induced magnet
 chumbakeey niyamon ke anusaar unamem pratikarshan hoto he or sanketak se judaa loha gum jaataa he, jisase sanketak main vikshep hota he
 In this also, the deflection angle is proportional to the square of the torrent
 ye yantra atyant saral or saste hote hai
 When measurement does not require much precision and many robust instruments are required, then ammeters and voltmeters based on this principle are used
 bijli gharon main switchboard par narm lohe ke yantron kaa hi prayog adhiktar hota he
 The attraction or repulsion in the induced magnet does not depend on the direction of fluency
 bal dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 Therefore whatever the direction of current flow, the direction of force is same
 inhen kaarnon se ye yantra disht dhara athwa prayavartin dhara donon ko naapane ke prayog main laae jate hai
 Due to the inductance of the coil, they cannot be used in the measurement of high frequency alternating current
 is prakaar ke emeter vidyutdhara ke ooshmiya prabhaav par nirbhar hote hai
 When current flows through a conductor, then that conductor becomes hot
 utpann ooshmaa kaa maan 2 x ke samaanupati hota he
 If the current is in the ampere and the resistance is in ohms, then ooshmaa kaa maan dharaman ke varg ke samaanupati hota he, arthath dhara kii disha par nirbhar nahin hai
 Therefore, such ammeters can be used to measure both directional or alternating current
 is prabhaav kaa prayog maapanvidhi main do prakaar se kiya gaya he : The first type of instrument was first created by Major Cardew in 1883
 hartman-bron ne isamen sadhaar kiya
 The current flows in the wire and spreads as it is heated
 is samay taar ke bich main judi hui kamaani taar ko khinchati he or ghirani prasar ke anusaar gum jaati he
 At the same time, the pulley indicator is deflected and the current value is displayed on the dial
 dhara kii anupasthiti main taar thandha ho kar sikudta he or sanketak phir apni purv dasha main aa jaataa he
 Such integrators have been used a lot due to being simple and cheap
 inamen kundali nahin hoti, is kaaran unamem prerakatv nahin hota or ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara bhi naapi jaati he, parantu ye paryaapt rup se yatharth nahin hote or adhik maatra kii dhara ko sahan karne main asamarth hote hai
 These are more convenient and accurate thermo-thermometer
 aajkal ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kaa maapan adhiktar unheen yantron se hota he
 The current flows through the wire and heats it
 is taar se jude hue tamba kanstantan taapyugma kaa sangam bhi garam hota he
 Due to this, electric carrying force is produced in the ratio of heat to temperature

 Although suicide attacks have occurred earlier in history and are famous for the way the Japanese airborne aircraft were flown during World War II, it has become typical for special attacks after the 1980s in which a person intentionally in his body or vehicle, etc
 The explosive explodes unexpectedly at public places or government establishments

 Ices: Arun, or Uranus, is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system
 vyas ke aadhaar par yah saura mandal kaa teesraa bada or dravyaman ke aadhaar par chauthaa bada grah he
 It is 14
5 times heavier than Earth in mass and 63 times larger than Earth in shape
 ausat rup main dekha jaae to prithvi se bahut kam ghanaa he - kyonki prithvi par pathar or anya baari padaarth adhik pratishat main hai jabaki arun par gas adhik he
 That is why it is only four and a half to fourteen times heavier than the earth, despite having a size of three to three times larger than the earth
 haalanki arun ko bina doorabeen ke aankh se bhi dekha ja saktaa he, yah itnaa dur he or itani madhyam roshni kaa prathit hota he ke pracheen vidwaanon ne kabhi bhi ise grah kaa darja nahin diya or ise ek dur timatimaata tara hi samajha
 On 13 March 1781, William Herschel announced its discovery
 arun doorabeen dwaara paae jane vaala pehla grah tha
 The four planets in our solar system are called gas demons, because they contain mostly gas instead of clay and stone and they are very large in size
 arun iname se ek he - baaki teen brihaspati, shani or varun hai
 Of these, Arun's texture is very similar to Varun
 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"

 Its orbital elements were first calculated by pierre-cimon Laplace in 1783
 Over time, discrepancies between predicted and observed orbits began to appear, and in 1841 John Couch Adams first proposed that this difference could be due to the gravitational pull of an invisible planet

 Near the time of the equinoxes, the sun is in front of the equinox of Uranus and gives a time period of day-night cycles, similar to that seen in most other planets
 urenus apane sabase haal ke vishuv par 7 disambar 2007 ko pahunchaa | One consequence of this axial tilt is that, in the mean period of the year, Uranus's polar regions receive a larger share of the energy invested from the Sun than its equatorial regions

 The underlying mechanism responsible for this is unknown

 Sometimes a different convention is used, in which the north and south poles of a body are defined according to the south-hand rule with respect to the direction of rotation

 This value indicates that it is mainly composed of different types of ice, such as water, ammonia, and methane
 The overall amount of ice in the interior of Uranus is not known properly, different figures emerge according to the choice of the model, it should be between 9
3 and 13
5 of the Earth's mass
 Hydrogen and helium make up only a small part of the composite
 The remaining non-ice content is composed of rocky material

 There may be a layer of ionized water, where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deep beneath it is dissolved water, in which oxygen crystallizes, but the hydrogen ions within the lattice structure of oxygen Roams freely haalanki model yathochit maanak ke upar kaa mana gaya, par yah adwitiya nahin he, anya model bhi avlokanon ko santusht karte he
 For example, if sufficient amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, then the total amount of ice in the inner part will be reduced and similarly the amount of rocks and hydrogen will increase
 Currently available data does not allow science to determine which model is correct

 urenus ke tropapaus main darj hua nimnatam taapmaana 49 kelvin he, jo urenus ko soramandal main sabase thanda grah banaata he
 One hypothesis for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a giant impact body, most of Uranus' proto heat was ejected, releasing that heat with an expired core temperature
 Another hypothesis is that some kind of barrier exists in the upper layers of Uranus which prevents the heat of the core from reaching the surface

 The Indian numeral system is known as hindu-arabic numeral system in the countries of the west because European countries had knowledge of this numeral system from the Arab country
 jabaki arabon ko yah gyaan bharat se mila tha
 The Indian numeral system consists of 10 digits totaling zero
 bhartiya ank pranali, sansar kii sarvaadhik prachlit ank pranali hai
 According to the famous French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace, neeche bhartiya ankon kaa devanagari evam antararashtriya swaroop dikhaaya gaya he- According to historians, Brahmi numerals were prevalent in India in the fourth century BC
 pune evam mumbai ke kshetra kii gufaaon main mili shilalekhon main tathaa uttar pradesh main mili prachinkaal ke sikkon main brahmi ank paye gayi hai
 The decimal system and zero were not used in Brahmi numerals
 apramanik dastavezon ke anusaar bharat main shunya, jo ki dashamalav pranali kaa aadhaar he, kaa avishkaar isvi san kii pratham shatabdi main ho chukaa tha
 However, authentic documents of the invention of zero have been found in India only in the fifth century
 gwalior main paye gayi shilaalekh, jo ki isvi san 870 kaa he, main shunya ke sanket paae gaye hai
 This inscription has been recognized by all historians by one opinion
 shunya ke avishkaar ho jane par bharat main das anko vaali ank pranali kaa prachlan armbh ho gaya jo ki is sansar main prachlit aadhunik ank pranaaliyon kaa aadhaar bani
 In the seventh century CE, Arabia acquired the Indian numeral system
 arab main bhartiya ankon ko gubaar ank or bhartiya ank pranali ko hindusa ank pranali ke naam se janaa jane laga
 Due to the number system obtained from Hindustan, it was named 'hindusa' there
 arab ke mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi naamak vidwaan ke kalkram vivaran ke anusaar, Roman numerals were used in Europe until the twelfth century
 roman ank pranali main keval saat ank hai, jo aksharon dwaara vyakt kiye jate hai
 These are I, V, X, L, C, d and M
 inhen anko ke jod ne ghataane se koi bhi sankhya likhi jaati he
 For example, if you want to write three then write the symbol of one three times III
 aath likhnaa he to paanch ke daayin taraf teen ek-ek ke chinh likhakar jod die or VIII ho gaya
 This system is so difficult and complicated that when Europe was introduced to the Indian numeral system in the twelfth century, it not only accepted it, but adopted it completely
 europe main kuch shatabdiyon baad jo vaigyanik-audyogic kranti hui, uske mul main bhartiya ank gananaa kaa hi yogadan he
 India invented nine digits and zero for calculation
 yahi nahin, ankon ke sthaneey maan kaa bhi avishkaar bharat main hi hua
 There is no value of zero, but if it is written to the right of a digit, it will indicate ten because now the local value of 1 becomes ten
 yadi dahini ore ek or shunya badha diya jaae, to yah sankhya sau ho jaaegi
 In this way, the valueless zero when written to the right of the digit increases the value of the second digit
 sankshep main, sthaan ke anusaar ankon ke mulya nirdhaaran ke siddhanth ko sthaneey maan kehete hai
 It is very easy to write any number from this system
 jis teen sau chavalis ko ham roman pranali main CCC XL IV likhte hai, use bhartiya vidhi se 344 likh sakate hai
 Through this, the largest number can be written briefly without any difficulty
 bhartiya ganit ne dashamalav pranali kaa bhi avishkaar kiya
 The first use of decimal digits in India is found by Aryabhatta I
 sambhav he ki iskaa avishkaar isse bhi bahut pehle hua ho
 But in Europe, the general publication of decimal numbers was done in the seventeenth century, whose knowledge he had definitely gained from India
 ye bhartiya ganitiya siddhanth europe ko arab ke madhyam se praapt hue the
 In Arabic language these numbers are called Hindsa
 hindasa arthath 'hind se praapt'
 The Arabic script is written from right to left, but in Arabic the digits are written from left to right
 yah bhi is baat kaa pramaan he ki arabi ankon kii utpatti arabi bhashaa ke saath arab desh main nahin hui, apitu ye baahar se aayaat kiye gaye hai
 When these Indian numerals reached Europe through the Arabs, they felt that these numbers were invented originally by the Arabs
 atev aaj bhi europe main ek se nau evam shunya ke bhartiya ankon ko ‘erebic neumral’ kehete hai
 In the former Arab country of Islam's prophet Hazrat Mohammed, Jihalia means 'the age of ignorance'

 During the reign of Khalifa al-mansur, some emissaries from Sindh went to Baghdad, including some scholars
 ve apane saath brahmagupta rachit brahmasfoot siddhanth evam khandakhadyak naamak granth bhi anya granthon ke saath baghdad le gaye
 With the help of these scholars, al-fajari and Yakub Khan Tariq translated them into Arabic, which had a special effect on Arabic mathematics

 isamen usne hindu ankon or unki upyogita ko samajhaayaa
 The books of Alexandre de Viladi and Jan Aq Halifax also disseminated the 'hindu numeral system'
 prarambh main iskaa virodh hua, kint pandrahavin shatabdi ke madhya tak europe ke sabhi deshon ne inako sweekaar kar liya tha
 Other European countries learned the Indian numeral system from Arabia
 chunki unhen yah ank pranali arab se mili thi isaliye unhone iskaa naam 'arabi ank pranali' rakh diya
 After having a good knowledge of history, it is now being called 'hindu-arabic numeral' or 'hindu numerology' or 'indian numerology'
 samay samay main tathaa desh desh main bhartiya ank pranali ke ankon ke sanket main anek parivartan huye
 In the end, these numbers became in the form of 0, 1, 2, 3, xxrep 4 
 and they got international recognition
 aadhunik ank evam ank pranali vastav main bhartiya hi hai
 Presently, these modern numerals are known as the "international form of Indian numerals"
