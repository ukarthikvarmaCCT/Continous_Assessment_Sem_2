 Two hundred years after Lord Buddha's Parinirvana, Ashokaputra Mahendra reached Sinhala Island, according to the "mahavansh" he preached in the island language to the people of Sinhala Island
 mahamati mahendra apane saath "buddhavachan" kii jo parampara laae the, vah maukhik hi thi
 That tradition must have been either a "magadhi" of Buddha's time, or a "prakrit" of two hundred years later that Mahendra Sthavira himself would have spoken
 sinhal itihaas kii manyata he ki mahendra sthavir apane saath na keval tripitak kii parampara laae the, balki unke saath uske bhashyon athwa uski atthakathaon kii parampara bhi
 Those chronicles were later translated into Sinhala
 vartmaan pali atthakathaayen mul pali atthakathaon ke sinhal anuwaadon ke pun: pali main kiye gaye anuwaad hai
 As far as Sanskrit is concerned, Indian Vedic sage-sages can be mentioned as its original men
 sinhal sahitya kaa mul purush kise mana jaae? yaa to bharat ke "laat" pradesh se hi sinhal main padaarpan karne vaale vijay kumaar or unke saathiyon ko yaa phir mahendra mahasthvir or unke saathiyon ko
 The history of inscriptions of Sinhala Island begins from the time of Devanapriya Tishya
 lekin abhi tak jitne bhi shilaalekh mili hai, unamem se pracheenatam shilaalekh raja vattagayani ke samay ke hi hai: aathvin shatabdi se lekar dasvin shatabdi ke bich ke samay ke jo shilaalekh sinhal main mili han, ve hi sinhal gadhy sahitya ke pracheenatam namoonay hai
 The most important literary work of the Anuradhpur period is the song of So Giri
 sinhal shilalipiyon ke baad yadi kisi duusare sahitya ko sinhal kaa pracheenatam sahitya mana ja saktaa he
 So these are the songs of this Giri
 si giri ke geeton ke baad jis pracheenatam kavy ko vastav main mahatvapoornn sthaan praapt ha, vah he sinhal kaa "siy bas lakar" naam kaa saahityalochak kavy
 It does not seem to be the same even if the translation of the poetry of the Dandi or the translation of the poem

 He took the shelter of Pali Dhammapada Atthakatha and composed a post like "dhammapiyya Atuva"

 At the beginning of the Polannaruv period, knowledge of Sanskrit literature was considered a matter of great pride
 raajaaon ke amaatyon ke putr yadi itani sanskrit sikh lete the ki ve shlokon kii rachana kar saken, to kabhi-kabhi raja prasann hokar bas itani si baat par hi unhen bahut sa dhan de daalate the
 a clear example of how much Sinhala language was being influenced by Sanskrit language is - Mahabodhi Dynasty Granthipad: The entire nomenclature of Sara is pure Sanskrit
 polanruv kaal ke antim bhaag main athwa dambdeni kaal ke aarambh main "karm vibhaag" naam ke ek gadhy granth kii rachana hui
 Whether from the literary point of view and religiously, out of the three most popular books which have been composed, one is "butsaran" or "buddhasharan"
 "dambdeni kaalay" kii ek vishisht rachana he sidat sangra
 It is the oldest attainable grammar of Sinhala language
 jis prakaar abhavatur, butsaran tathaa ratnawali ne sinhal gadhy sahitya ko samrudh kiya he, usee prakaar sinhal ummg jataka ne bhi sinhal gadhy sahitya ko bahut unche uthaaya he
 But the largest text of Sinhala prose literature would be considered as the Sinhala "jataka Vessel"
 yah pali jataka atthkatha kaa hi sinhal bhavanuaad he
 The "karun-gal-kaal in a way" of almost fifty years is only an extension of the "dambadeni Kalaya"
 kintu kuch vishisht rachanaaon ke kaaran uskaa bhi swatantra astitv sweekaar karnaa padataa he
 Literary service was more than that of kurunai-gal-kalay
 "nikaay-sangrah" jaisi mahatvapurn kriti kii rachana isi kaal main hui
 "gumpole Kalay" is followed by "kotte Kalay"
 aaj sinhal kavita kii jo vishisht sthiti he, vah bahut karke "kotte kaalay" main hi hue vikaas kaa parinaam he
 Whoever received any introduction to Sinhala literature should not have been unfamiliar with Low Bayou Sangra
 atyant choti kriti hone par bhi iskaa ghar-ghar prachaar he
 Do not know how many people know this work
 shri rahul mahasthvir dwaara rachit kavy shekhar tathaa unheen ke shishy vaitteve dwaara rachit guttil kavy "kotte kaalay" kii do vishisht rachanaayen hai
 "kotte Kalaya" is followed by "sitakat Kalaya" and Sitakak Kalya is followed by "senkad Kalaya"
 is antim kaal kii visheshta he tamil granthon ke sinhal anuwaad hona
 If we follow the literary trend of the earlier part of "mahnuvar Kalaya" i
e
 "senkad Kalaya", we will see that such a variety of subjects have never been poetic before
 attharahavin shatabdi ke purv bhaag se aarambh hone vaala samay hi srilanka ke itihaas kaa vartmaan yug he
 This new era can easily be divided into two parts - the first part from AD 1706 to AD 1815, the second part from AD 1815 onwards
 "mahanuvar kaalay" main dharamshastra sambandhi sahitya ne jitani bhi unnati kii uskaa sara shrey ek hi mahaan vibhuti ko diya ja saktaa he
 The name of that Vibhuti was Sanghraj Aranankar
 unhone is uddeshy kii siddhi ke liye chaturmukh prayaas kiye
 Some of the literary trends that prevailed in "colombo Kalaya" are new editions of old books, Sinhala commentaries, translations of English and other language books and criticism-criticism literature
 nai vidhaon main natya granthon tathaa upanyaason kii pradhanta he
 Ever since it has been distinguished as a medium of Sinhala language education, many "family dictionaries" have been devised to be useful to classical books
 idhar sinhal sahitya main hindi se anudit kuch granth bhi paae hai, vaise hi jaise hindi main bhi sinhal sahitya ke kuch granth

 Intelligence gain or intelligence quotient is a calculation derived from several different standardized tests from which intelligence is assessed
 "IQ" pad kii utpatti german shabd intelligenz-quotient se hui he jiskaa pehali baar prayog german manovaigyanik wiliam stern ne 1912 main 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main alfred bainet or theodor simon dwaara prastaavit paddatiyon ke liye kiya, jo aadhunik bacchon ke bauddhik pareekshan ke liye apanaaya gaya tha
 Although the term "IQ" is still commonly used, methods such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale are now used in modern intellectual level testing based on the rank Gaussian Bell Curve measured toward a subject
 , Where the central value is 100 and the standard deviation is 15
 haalanki vibhinn pareekshanon main maanak vichlan alag-alag ho sakate hai
 The calculation of the intellectual level is seen to be associated with factors such as morbidity and mortality, the social status of the parents, and to a large extent the paternal intellectual level
 jabaki uski viraasat lagbhag ek sadi se janchi ja chuki he phir bhi is baat ko lekar vivaad bana hua he ki uski kitni viraasat grahya he or viraasat ke tantra abhi bhi bahes ke vishay bane hue hai
 IQ calculations are used in many contexts: prophets associated with academic achievements or special needs, sociologists studying people at the IQ level and the relationship between IQ scores and other changes and the work done and done It is done by people who predict income

 It is a matter of dispute whether these changes in numbers reflect the reality of intellectual ability or it is just a series of problems of past or present

 Stulmiller found that the extent of the restriction in the family environment remains the same in the case of adoptions as those in adoptive families, for example the socio-economic status of the then general population, whereas in previous studies shared families The role of the environment was greatly exaggerated
 god lene main sudhaar kii seemaa ke adhyayan main sudhaar se sanket milte he kyonki saamaajik-aarthik sthiti IQ ke parivartan ke liye 50% tak jimmedaar hoti he
 However, the impact of the ban on the extent of IQ in the case of adoption has been studied by Matt mcgue and colleagues, who wrote that "the extent of the parent's psychiatry and the socio-economic status of the family adopts the child
" kiqs do not affect the reciprocal relationship
 erik turkheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne god lene kaa hi adhyayan nahin kiya, balki america ke garib pariwaron ko shaamil kiya he
 The conclusion states that the difference in the ratio of IQ varies due to the instability caused by changes in genes and socio-economic status of the environment

 He suggests that studies of the role of shared environmental factors have been underestimated in previous studies, often studies of affluent middle class families
 devlin or unke sahyogiyon kaa ek meta-vishleshan nechar ke prishth 212 par prakashit he
 It evaluates an alternative model to the environmental impact of previous studies and finds that this figure is superior to the commonly used 'family-environment' model

 Bouchard and mcgue, reviewing the article in 2003, have argued that Devlin's conclusions about the importance of heredity are not significantly different from previous reports, and that their prenatal findings contradict previous reports

 During the ceremony, the child holds a quartet and silver coin in the hands and the child takes bracelets, silk and sackcloth
 yah un kii mehnat or kaarykushalta kaa parichaayak hota he
 After the adult ritual, the youth of the Fumi caste take part in the production labor and various social activities, and they have also got the status of love and marriage

 The set of gross works related to dictionary formation is called koshakarma or lexicography
 vishyon kii drushti se shabdkoshon ke varg yaa vibhaag bananaa kathin he
 Different Kokhars used to create such subjects according to their understanding
 unka na to koi nishchit kram hota tha or na ho hi saktaa tha
 So people often had to memorize the entire dictionary
 isi kaaran paashchaatya deshon main shabdkosh aksharkram se banane lage
 There was no need to rote such a dictionary and he could use it as and when required
 aajkal praaia: sabhi deshon or sabhi bhashaaon main kosh ke kshetra me isi kram ko prayog hone laga he : jo jigyaasu kii drushti se sabase adhik subhite kaa hota hai
 That's why alphabet is often used in all types of thesaurus
 yon to kosh ke anek prakaar hote hai, par arth ke vichaar se ve do bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 One is those in which meanings and interpretations of the words of a language are in the same language and other in which the meanings of the words of one language are given in another language or languages
 vishay ke vichaar se kosh anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise-ganit kosh, vidhik kosh, vaidyak kosh, sahitya kosh aadi
 Such dictionaries are often counted in terms such as agricultural terminology, philosophical terminology, geographical terminology etc
 inke sivaa kuch vishisht kaviyon, boliyon aadi ke bhi alag alag kosh hote hai, jaise-tulsi kosh, sur kosh, avadhi kosh, brajabhasha kosh aadi
 The main symbols, topics or words that contain thesaurus or tables in important texts of a particular subject are called successive metaphorical index, subject index or concordance
 koshrachana ek kala he
 Knowledge of this art can be obtained by studying the dictionaries of the most advanced languages of the present era with a subtle view
 achche or pramanik koshon kaa sampadan tab tak keval vidwata ke bal par nahin ho saktaa, jab tak koshrachana kii kala kaa bhi puraa puraa gyaan na ho or is kala kaa gyaan koshon ke jivanavyapee adhyayan se hi ho saktaa he
 All types of thesaurus are made only for the fulfillment of a particular purpose and the need of a particular area
 at: koshrachana main mukhyat: isi uddeshy yaa aavashyaktaa kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa hai
 Secondly, one has to keep in mind that his entire body is balanced in all respects; It is not that an organ grows more than it needs or justification, and someone seems to be weak or inferior in comparison
 shabdon kaa vivechan bhi or us vivechan ke angon kaa kram bhi sadaa ek sa rahanaa chahie
 Words also have castes or classes, so all the words of a caste or class should have the same interpretation
 yadi pramanik granthon athwa lekhakon ke udhaaharan liye jaae, to unka utana hi ansh lenaa chahie, jitne main aashay spasht ho sake or jigyaasu kaa samaadhaan ho jaae
 Good dictionaries also contain terminology for all types of fields and subjects
 isaliye sampadak kaa adhik se adhik vishyon kaa saamaanya gyaan yaa bodh hona chahie
 When needed, it is necessary to seek help from a good and authentic book of an unknown or new subject or even from a good writer
 koshrachana ke kaary main drushti bahut vyapak rakhana chahie or vritti madhukaari honi chahie
 The vision should be so sharp and subtle that it can easily make sense of Neer Ksheer and by finding old errors, faults, mistakes, etc
, it can be easily corrected and corrected
 koshkar main pakshpaat yaa rogadwesh naam ko bhi nahin rahanaa chahie
 Its sole purpose should be to serve language and literature
 koshon main pradhanta arthon or vivechanon kii hi hoti he, at: unamem kahin vyapti yaa ativyapti nahin rahani chahie
 All things should be brief, nappy and moderate as much as possible
 kosh main adhik se adhik or thos jaankaree kam se kam shabdon main prastut karke hi jaani chahie
 There is no place in the dictionary for unnecessary or recruitment matters
 shabdon ke kuch rup to maanak hote hai or bahut se rup sthanik yaa prantiy hote hai
 The spatial or provincial words of which the standard forms are received should be interpreted within the same standard words and their standard or provincial forms should be mere reference to their standard forms
 isse bahut bada laabh yah hota he ki anya bhashaa-bhashiyon ko sahaj main shabdon ke maanak rup kaa pataa chal jaataa he or bhashaa kaa maanak rup sthir hone main sahaayta milti he-aparichiton ke dwaara bhashaa kaa rup sahasaa bigadane nahin paata
 The same thing should be done with regard to Sanskrit words which have many synonyms
 jaise camel, nadi, parvat, samudr aadi
 While giving their synonyms in front of words, it should also be kept in mind that only those synonyms should be given the exact meaning or measure of the original word
 jin paryaayon ke kaaran kuch bhi bhram utpann ho saktaa ho, un paryaayon kaa aise prasangon main parityag karnaa hi shreyaskar hoga
 Recently, Webster's New World Dictionary has set a new model in front of lexicographers, which is very useful and useful for dictionaries, because they are very useful and useful
 usamen anek shabdon ke antargat unase milte julate paryaayon ke sookshm antar bhi dikhalaae gaye hai, yatha - feare ke antargat dred, friete, elarm, disme, teror or painic ke sookshm antar bhi batala die gaye hai
 It has been done in such a way that the work of the lexicon is not finished by conveying the meaning of the words, but even beyond this, its job is to tell people the correct use of the words
 hamaare yahan aise saikadon hajaaron shabd milenge, jinke parsparik sookshm antar batalaaye ja sakate hai or is prakaar jigyaasuon ko shabdon par nae dhang se vichaar karne kaa abhyaas karaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is another new and useful practice in recent good and big English dictionaries, which can be particularly useful for Indian language dictionaries
 praaia: sabhi bhashaaon main bahut se aise yogic shabd hote hai jo upsarg lagaakar bana liye jate hai
 Junior to Junior, Causal to Indeterminate, Expected to Unexpected, Necessary to Unnecessary, Minister to Deputy Minister, Committee to Subcommittee, Adherence to Compliance, Excursion from Cruise, Reaction to Karma, Legislation from Legislation etc
 upsargon ke yoga se bananevaale aise shabdon kii sankhya bahut adhik hoti he
 Such words are divided into two classes or can be divided
 ek to aise shabd jinke shabd purv pad tathaa uttar pad mil kar bhi kisi nae yaa vishisht arth se yukt nahin hote or isi liye saadhaaran shabdon ke antargat rahete hai
 Such words and their meanings greatly increase the level of the dictionary
 is prakaar ke vyarth vistaar se bachane ke liye webster ke nae koshon main yah nai paddati apanaai gai he ki unhen swatantra shabd nahin maanate or isi liye unke arth bhi nahin liye gaye hai
 At the end of the page, a list of such words is given below a line, as-un-destined, un-disturbed, un-free, un-hurt, un-invoked etc
 haan, inke vipareet duusare varg ke kuch aise shabd avashya hote hai jinamein upsargon ke yoga se kuch nae arth nikalate hai
 As in the adjective form, the form of Achcha is hairless, but in noun form it is also a name for the planet Ketu
 anagaar kaa arth bina ghar-barwaala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah sanyasi kaa bhi vaachak he
 Therefore it is necessary to take such words
 jin shabdon ke arth purvpad or utaarpad ke yoga se swat: nasht ho jate hon, unhen koshon main arthsahit lenaa vyarth hi samajha jane laga he
 Therefore, it would be sufficient to just give a list of such words in the page
 haan, jin yogic shabdon main donon padon ke yoga se koi nayaa or vishesh arth nikalataa ho, unhen yathasthaan arthsahit lenaa to aavashyak he hi
 The method of our old Sanskrit dictionary has been that the words formed by the sum of ati, prati, etc
 are given together under the same title under their former term
 hindi ke kuch koshon ne bhi is pratha kaa anukaran kiya he
 Although this method is rational from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar, even in Sanskrit dictionaries, it does not appear to be fully followed
 isamen sthaan kii kuch bachat avashya hoti he, par asaadhaaran pathakon ke liye shabd dhoondhna bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it is difficult to find words from this method even for people who are very familiar with its rules and principles
 prayek bhashaa main kuch shabd aise hote hai jo alag alag arthon ke vichaar se avyay, kriyavisheshan, visheshan, pratyay sangya aadi bhi hote hai or alag alag mulon se bhi vyutpann hote hen, yatha hindi ko aan shabd sangya bhi he, visheshan bhi or pratyay bhi
 In its noun form, it is derived from a few different origins in many of its meanings
 aise shabd aadhunik or shreshth angareji koshon main alag or swatantra shabd maane jate hai or unke alag alag sheershak rakhkar unka vivechan kiya jaataa he, yatha-angareji main waayiz visheshan bhi he, sangya bhi or pratyay bhi or teenon roopon main uske sheershak alag alag rakhe gaye hai
 If they are also followed in the lexicons of Indian languages, it will be very good in many respects
