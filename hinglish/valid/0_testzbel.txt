 Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted
 in ayskon main aamtaur par aayran oxidon kii bahut adhik maatra hoti he or inkaa rang gahare dhoosar se lekar, chamkila pilaa, gaharaa bangnee or jang jaisaa laal tak ho saktaa he
 Iron is usually magnetite, hematite, joitite), limonite
 n), yaa siderit, ke rup main paaya jaataa he
 Hematite is also known as "natural ore"
 yah naam khanan ke praarambhik varshon se sambandhit he, jab hametit ke vishisht ayskon main 66% louh hota tha or inhen sidhe louh banane vaali blast fernence main daal diya jaataa tha
 Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is used to make steel
 vastav main, yah tark diya gaya he ki louh ayask "sambhavatya tel ko chhodkar, kisi bhi anya vastu kii tulana main vaishvik arthvyavastha kaa adhik abhinn ang he
 " dhatvik louh kii dharti kii sataha par upasthiti vastutah agyaat he, parantu yah ulkaon se milane vaale louh-nikal mishra dhaatu main paaya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi gahare mental xenolyth main paaya jaataa he
 Therefore, all sources of iron used by human industries are iron oxide minerals, the initial form used in industry is metamet
 haalanki, kuch sthitiyon main, louh ayask ke nimna shrenee ke sroton kaa upyog audyogikrut socitiyon ke dwaara kiya gaya, jab ucch shrenee kaa hametit ayask uplabdh nahin tha
 This includes the use of taconite in the United States after World War II, and the use of joithat and or bog ore during the American Revolution and Napoleon's War
 pragaitihaasik samaaj main louh ayask ke strot ke rup main latterit kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Magnetite is often used because it is magnetized and therefore can be easily released from geng
 louh ayask ke nimna shrenee ke sroton ko aamtaur par shuddhikaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Due to the high density of hematite relative to silicates, it is usually broken into small pieces for purification, after which it is powdered and heavy liquid separation is used
 iske liye acchhee tarah se pise gaye ayask ko, bentonite yaa kisi or agent se yukt vilyan ke upar se pravaahit kiya jaataa he, jisase vilyan kaa ghanatv bad jaataa he
 When the density of the solution reaches the appropriate level, the hematite sinks and the silicate mineral floats on the surface and can be removed from the surface and separated
 louh ayask kii khanan vidhiyaan ayask ke prakaar par nirbhar karti hai
 At present four main types of iron ore deposits are found, which depend on the geology and mineralogy of the ore deposits
 ye hai magnetic, titanomagnetic, messive hametit or pisolitic yranstone bhandar 
 Bonded iron) is formed from metamorphic sedimentary rocks that are mainly composed of thin layers of iron minerals and silica
 isamen maujuud louh khanij carbonate siderit ho saktaa he, parantu louh ayask ke rup main kaam main aane vaale khanij main oxide magnetit yaa hametit hota he
 Bonded iron manufacturing is known in North America as taconite
 BIF ke khanan main sthool krashing or screening kii jaati he, iske baad krashing ke saath ise baarik pisa jaataa he, jisase ayask aisi sthiti main pahunch jaataa he ki crystalikrut magnetit or quartez itane baarik ho jate hai ki jab parinami powder ko ek chumbakeey pruthakkaarak main se hokar pravaahit kiya jaataa he to quartez peeche chhot jaataa he
 The process of mining involves activities of large quantities of ores and waste materials
 vyarth padaarth do roopon main hota he, khan main se nikali aisi chattaane jo ayask nahin hai, jo mulok kehalaata he or avaanchit khanij jo khud ayask kaa aantarik hissaa he, jo geng kehalaata he
 Mulok is removed from the mine as a waste material and the geng is separated during the process of purification or refining and removed from the ore as a residue
 taconite avshesh adhiktar khanij quartez hote hai, jo rasinic rup se niskriy hote hai
 This material is stored in large, regulated stagnant water ponds
 mukhya bindu jo magnetit ko aarthik drushti se upyogi banaate hai, ve hai, magnetit kaa crystalia gun, BIF poshak chattaanon main louh kii shrenee or sandooshak tatv jo sandrit magnetit main maujuud hote hai
 The size and strip ratio of most magnetite sources is irrelevant because the BIF is constructed hundreds of meters thick, has layers of hundreds of kilometers, which can easily contain 2,500 million or more tons of ore
 louh kii praroopik shrenee jisamen bandhit louh nirmaan se yukt magnetit aarthik rup se upyukt ho jaataa he, usamen mote taur par 25% Fe hota he
 Which can generally yield 33% to 40% magnetite, which can produce 64% concentrated iron
 praroopik sandrit magnetit louh ayask main 0
 Contains less than 1% phosphorus, 3–7% silica and less than 3% aluminum
 magnetic ke kanon kaa aakaar or silica ke dravyaman ke anusaar iskaa ansh yah nirdhaarit karata he ki chattan ko kis seemaa tak pisa jaye taaki ek ucch shuddhta se yukt sandrit magnetit uplabdh karaane ke liye chumbakeey pruthakkaran kii prakriya ko prabhavi rup se kiya ja sake
 This determines the amount of energy a milling process will require
 aam taur par adhikansh magnetit BIF bhandar ko itnaa pisa jaataa he ki kanon kaa aakaar 32 se 45 micro meter ho jaae, taaki kam silica se yukt sandrit magnetit praapt kiya ja sake
 Concentrated magnetite typically contains 63% Fe by weight and typically contains less phosphorus, less aluminum, less titanium, and less silica, and is demanded at a premium price
 vartmaan main magnetic louh ayask kaa khanan america main minesota or michigan main kiya jaataa he or taconite kaa khanan purvi canada main kiya jaataa he
 bif-containing magnetite is currently mined exclusively in Brazil, exporting it to Asia in considerable quantities and Australia has a new and larger magnetite iron ore industry
 kabhi kabhi grenite or ultrapotacic aagney chattaane magnetit ke crystalon ko alag karti hai or sandran ke liye aarthik drushti se upyukt magnetit ke pind banaati hai
 Some iron deposits, especially those in Chile, are formed by the flow of volcanoes, which contain a collection of characteristic crystals of magnetite
 ataakama registan main chile ke magnetit ke louh ayask bhandar, in jwalamukhi nirmaanon se nikalne vaali dhaaraon main magnetit ke jalodh sanchay banaate hai
 In the past, some magnetite skarns and hydrothermal deposits served as high-grade iron ore deposits requiring very little refining
 malaysia or indonesia main isi prakruti ke kai grenit se sambandhit bhandar bhi hai
 Other sources of magnetite iron ore include metamorphic accumulation of effective magnetite ore, such as ores found in the Tawman River of Tasmania that are formed by the cutting of ophiolite ultramafics
 louh ayask kaa ek anya laghu strot he paraton main jamane vaala megma kaa sanchay jisamen praroopik rup se venedium se saath titanium se yukt magnetit ayask hota he
 These ores form a niche market in which special types of smelters are used for the extraction of iron, titanium and vanadium
 in ayskon kaa shuddhikaran anivaary rup se bandhit louh nirmaan ayask kii tarah hi kiya jaataa he, parantu inhen aamtaur par krashing or screening ke dwaara adhik aasaani se parishkrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Typical concentrated titanomagnetite contains 57% Fe, 12% Ti and 0
 5% V2O5 hota he
 Hematite iron ore deposits are currently used in all continents, most commonly in South America, Australia and Asia
 adhikansh bade hametit louh ayask ke bhandar kayantarit roopantaran ke dwaara nirmit bandhit louh nirmaan hote hai or kabhi kabhi aagney ke sanchay bhi ho sakate hai
 Haematite iron is generally found to be lower than bif-containing magnetite or other rocks that make up its main source or protolith rock, but this makes iron extraction cheaper, since it has a higher content of iron content, so it is purified
 Or finishing is not required
 haalanki, hametit ayask magnetit ayskon kii tulana main sakht hote hai or isliye yadi shuddhikaran kii aavashyaktaa ho to inhen krash karne or pisane ke liye adhik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Hematite ores may also contain high concentrations of other ingredients, typically including high amounts of phosphorus, water, and aluminum
 niryaat kii shrenee ke hametit ayask aamtaur par 62–64% Fe range main hote hai
 China || 820 louh duniya kaa sabase adhik istemaal kiya jane vaala dhaatu he, iskaa upyog mukhyatya steel ke rup main kiya jaataa he jiskaa louh ayask mukhya avyav he, jo prativarsh kaam aane vaale sabhi dhaatuon kaa lagbhag 95% hissaa banaata he
 It is mainly used in structural engineering applications and in marine purposes, automobiles and general industrial applications
 louh yaa aayran se yukt chattaane puri duniya main pai jaati hai, parantu ayask shrenee kii vanijyik khanan gatividhiyaan kuch hi deshon main mukhya rup se dekhi jaati hai, jinaki suchi sarini main di gayi he
 The main obstacle in economics for iron ore reserves is not necessarily the category or size of the store, as it is not particularly strict to geologically certify the load in the substantial tonnage of rocks present
 mukhya baadha he bazaar ke saapeksh louh ayask kii sthiti, ise bazaar main laane ke liye rail buniyadi dhaanche kii laagat or aisa karne ke liye aavashyak urja kii laagat
 Iron ore mining is a high-volume, low-profit trade, because iron costs much less than base metals
 isamen bahut adhik puunji lagati he or adhosaranchana jaise rail ke liye isamen bahut adhik nivesh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, kyonki iskaa upyog ayask ko khan se jahaaj tak le jane main kiya jaataa he
 For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands of some key players
 vishwa main ausatan ek billian metric ton kachche ayask kaa salanaa utpaadan hota he
 The world's largest producer of iron ore is Brazilian Mining Corporation Well, followed by anglo-australian companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group
 ek or australian saplir, fortescu metels group limited ne australia ke utpaadan ko duniya main duusare sthaan par laane main madad kii he
 Iron ore trade by sea, that is, the iron ore that was transported by ships to other countries, was 849m tonnes in 2004
 australia or brazil bazaar kaa 72 pratishat hissaa banaate hue, samudr se hone vaale vyapaar par haaavee hai
 BHP, Rio and Vel control 66% of the market between them
 australia main louh ayask ko teen mukhya sroton se praapt kiya jaataa he: pisolit "channel louh bhandar" ayask praathmik bandhit-louh nirmaan ke yantric apradan se utpann hota he or aluvial channelon main sanchit ho jaataa he jaise panavonica, pashchimi australia; or prabhavi kayantarit rup se parivartit bandhit louh nirmaan se sambandhit ayask jaise newman, chichester range, hammersle range or kulianobing, pashchimi australia main
 Other types of ore have also been reported recently, such as oxidized ferruginous hardcaps, for example latrite ore deposits near Lake Argyle in Western Australia
 bharat main louh ayask ke kul vasuuli yogya bhandar lagbhag hametit ke 9602 million ton or magnetit ke 3408 million ton hai
 Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Orissa, Goa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are the main Indian producers of iron ore
 louh ayask kii duniya kii khapat salanaa 10% bad rahi he iske mukhya upabhokta china, japan, korea or sanyukt rajya america or europea sangh hai
 China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore, the world's largest steel producer
 yah sabase bada ayatak bhi he, jisane 2004 main louh ayask ke 52% samudri vyapaar kii kharid kii
 Next to China is Japan and Korea, which consume significant amounts of crude iron ore and metallurgical coal
 2006 main, china ne 38% kii vaarshik vruddhi ke saath 588 million ton louh ayask kaa utpaadan kiya
 Over the past 40 years, iron ore prices have been determined by a so-called benchmark system, between miners and steel makers
 parmparik rup se, in donon samoohon ke bich hui pehali deal ne ek benchmark sthapit kiya jiskaa anusaran shesh udyog ke dwaara kiya gaya
 In this way, the same price is negotiated once per year
 ek spot bazaar bhi maujuud he, haalanki yah paaramparik rup se bahut chota he
 The problem with this system is that when the spot prices are higher than the benchmark, the miners do not get additional revenue, which is earned by selling the ore in the spot market
 jab spot keemten benchmark kii tulana main kam hoti hai, kuch ispaat milen, apane ayask ko spot bazaar se kharid kar dhokhebaaji karti hai
 In other words, the benchmark system provides protection to steel mills but not to miners
 duusari ore, benchmark pranali khanankartaaon or steel milon ke liye keemton main sthirataa laati he, jisase ve apane utpaadan kii yojana adhik prabhavi rup se bana sakate hai
 In recent years, the benchmark system has been breaking down, as some miners motivate their customers to use the spot market and interactions with the largest buyer, China, cause friction
 kyonki spot bazaar kaa aakaar or mahatva bahut adhik bad gaya he, vittiya baadhaon se bachane ke saadhan jaise louh ayask main swap utpann hua he
 Given that most other bulk commodities have emerged as a market-based price system, it is a reasonable condition that iron ore will follow this path over the medium to long term
 haalanki, kuch maamalon main, shipping kii laagat ayask ke mulya se adhik he
 This is particularly relevant for Brazilian iron ore, which has to travel more to reach China than Australian iron ore
 isiilie, ateet main australian nirmaataaon ne apane ayask par premium ke liye tark diya, iskaa kaaran yah he ki yah jahaaj ke liye bahut sasta he
 Currently iron ore reserves are quite large, but some people say that the rate at which there is a continuous exponential growth in its consumption, it may even limit the source of this resource
 udhaaharan ke liye, world watch institute lester brown kaa suzav he ki 2% prativarsh kii vruddhi ke saath ek bahut sangrakshanvaadi akalan ke aadhaar par louh ayask 64 saal tak hi chal paayegaa
 The oxygen and iron atoms in iron ore are bonded together as molecules
 ise dhatvik louh main badalane ke liye iskaa pragalan karnaa padataa he or isamen se oxigen ko hataane ke liye ise ek pratyaksh apchayan kii prakriya se guzarana padataa he
 Oxygen-iron bonds are very strong, and to separate iron from oxygen, a more strong element bond must be present that can combine oxygen with itself
 iske liye carbon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he kyonki adhik taapmaana par carbon-oxigen bandha kii prabalata louh-oxigen bandha kii tulana main ucch hoti he
 In this way, iron ore is grinded and mixed with coke and ignited in the smelting process
 haalanki, yah itnaa aasaan nahin he jitna dikhataa he; louh se alag hone vaali oxigen pehle carbon mono oxide banaati he
 In this way, the process of smelting of iron and carbon is carried out in a state of low oxygen so that the carbon burns to form CO and not CO2
 kuch tatwon kii yahaan tak ki bahut thodi maatra kaa paaya janaa bhi louh ayask ke vyavhaar yaa pragalan kii gatividhiyon ko bahut adhik prabhavit karata he
 These effects can be good and bad as well, some can be very bad
 kuch rasayanon jaise flux ko jaanboojh kar milaayaa jaataa he jo blast fernence kii kriya ko adhik prabhavi banaate hai
 Others are added because they make iron more liquid, or give it some more desirable properties
 ayask, eendhan or flakes kaa chunaav is baat ko nirdhaarit karata he ki dhaatumal kaise vyavhaar karata he or utpann louh kii visheshtaayen kya hongi
 Ideally iron ore only contains iron and oxygen
 vastav main aisa bahut kam dekha jaataa he
 Typically, iron ore contains many elements, often undesirable in modern steel
 silica lagbhag hameshaa louh ayask main paaya jaataa he
 Most of this silica separates as clinker in the smelting process
 1300° se adhik taapmaana par kuch kaa apchayan ho jaataa he or yah louh ke saath mishra dhaatu banaata he
 The hotter the furnace, the more silicon in the iron
 16 veen se 18 veen shatabdi ke europea kachche louh main 1
 It is not uncommon for silicon to be found up to 5%
 silicon kaa pramukh prabhaav yah he ki yah dhoosar louh ke nirmaan ko badhaava detaa he
 Gray iron is less brittle and easier to give a finish than white iron
 isiilie dhalaai kii prakriya main ise praathamikta di jaati he
 According to Turner's report, silicon also reduces contraction, reduces holes caused by the gas released during its cooling and makes casting more efficient
 phosphorus ke louh par chaar pramukh prabhaav padate hai: yah isaki kathorta or prabalata ko badhata he, thos hone ke taapmaana ko kam karata he, taralata ko badhaata he, jaldi thanda hone main madad karata he
 Depending on what purpose the iron will be used for, it can have a good or bad effect
 bog ayask main aksar phosphorus kii unchi maatra hoti he
 The concentration and hardness of iron increases with the concentration of phosphorus
 dhalwaan louh main 0
 05% phosphorus makes it hard as medium carbon steel
 adhik phosphorus se yukt louh ko thande main hi hathaudon se kathor kiya ja saktaa he
 The effect of hardness is true for any concentration of phosphorus
 jitna zyada isamen phosphorus hota he utana hi louh adhik kathor ho jaataa he or ise hathaudon ke dwaara or adhik kathor banaaya ja saktaa he
 Modern steel makers can increase hardness by up to 30%, for which they have a phosphorus level of 0
 07 or 0
 Maintains between 12% and is also resistant to iron shock
 yah shaman ke kaaran kathorta ko or adhik badhaata he, lekin saath hi ucch taapmaana par louh main carbon kii vileyata ko bhi kam karata he
 This reduces its usefulness in the manufacture of blister or blister steel, where the amount and speed of absorption of carbon is very important
 phosphorus ke louh main paae jane kaa ek nimna paksh bhi he
 0
 2% se adhik sandratha main paae jane par louh teji se kam avadhi main thanda ho jaataa he, yaa kam taapmaana par bhangur ho jaataa he
 Quick cooling is especially important in iron rod
 haalanki, chadi vaala louh aamtaur par garm kar ke hi kaam main liya jaataa he, lekin yaa sakht, hona chahie, aasaani se mud jane yogya hona chahie or kamare ke taapmaana par aghat rodhi bhi hona chahie
 a nail that is shattered to pieces by a hammer or a wheel that breaks into a rock, will not get a good price when sold
 phosphorus kii ucch sandratha kisi bhi louh ko vyarth bana sakati he
 The effects of quick cooling increase with temperature
 is prakaar se, louh kaa ek tukda, jo garmiyon main purna rup se upyogi he, vah sardiyon main bahut adhik bhangur ho saktaa he
 There is evidence that during the Middle Ages very rich people held swords containing high phosphorus in summer and low phosphorus swords in winter
 phosphorus kaa saavdhaneepurvak niyantran dhalaai kii prakriya main bahut adhik phydemand ho saktaa he
 Phosphorus lowers the liquidity temperature, thereby iquidus depresses the temperature, allowing the iron to stay longer and increases for molten fluidity
 1% maatra kaa badhaaya janaa pighale hue louh ko baha kar doguni duuri tak le jayega
 Maximum impact, around 500 ° C, ko 10
 2% sandratha par praapt kiya jaataa he
 For foundry work Turner found that 0 in ideal iron
 2-0
 55% was phosphorus
 parinami louh ko jab saanchon main bharaa gaya to isamen rikt sthaan kam the or isamen sankuchan bhi kam hua
 In the 19th century, some producers of ornamental cast iron used iron containing 5% phosphorus
 charam taralata ne unhen bahut adhik jatil lekin najuk dhalaai main madad kii
 However, they could not carry the load because they lacked strength
 vahaan ucch phosphorus lohe ke liye do upachaar kar rahe hai
 Is old and easy, avoidance
 yadi kisi ke dwaara utpaadit louh jaldi thanda hota he, to vah louh ayask kaa ne strot khojega
 The second method involves mixing iron oxide and oxidizing phosphorus during the mining process
 yah takanic aamtaur par 19 veen sadi main pudling se sambandhit he, jise sambhavatya jaldi nahin samajha gaya
 For example, Isaac Zane, owner of Marlborough Iron, did not know it in 1772
 bataaya jaataa he ki zaane aadhunik vikaas ke liye pratishthit the, yah takanic virgina or pencilvenia ke aayran masters ke liye bhi agyaat thi
 Phosphorus is a harmful contaminant, as it makes the steel brittle, regardless of 0
 6% kii alp sandratha main hi upasthit ho
 Phosphorus cannot be easily removed with the help of flux or smelting and therefore the amount of phosphorus must be reduced to work on iron ore
 bharat kaa louh stambh jisamen jang nahin lagata use phosphoric sanghatan ke dwaara parirakshit kiya gaya he
 Phosphoric acid has been used as a rust modulator, since phosphoric iron is less susceptible to oxidation
 aluminium kii laghu maatra kai ayskon or kuch lim stone main upasthit hoti hai
 The ore is washed before smelting to remove the former
 eent ke astr vaali bhatti main daalane se pehle, aluminium kaa sandushan itnaa kam hota tha ki iskaa louh yaa dhaatumal par koi prabhaav nahin padataa tha
 However, when bricks began to be used to internalize the furnace floor and the lining of the blast furnace, the amount of aluminum increased dramatically
 aisa dhaatumal ke dwaara bhatti ke aantarik str ke apradan ke karan hota tha
 Aluminum is very difficult to reduce
 iske parinamswaroop louh kaa aluminium sandushan ek samasya nahin he
 However, it increases the viscosity or viscosity of the clinker
 iske bhatthi ke sanchaalan par kai pratikul prabhaav padate hai
 The dense slag will be charged slowly and this will increase the time taken in this process
 aluminium kii adhik maatra bhi dravit dhaatumal ko hataane main samasya paidaa karegi
 At the extreme, it will be the cause of a frozen furnace
 adhik aluminium se yukt dhaatumal main kai vilyan hote hai
 The first is to stop; Do not use ore or lime source in sources with high aluminum content
 lim flux ke anupaat ke badhane se viscasita kam ho jaayegi
 Sulfur or sulfur is a contaminant often found in coal
 yah kai ayskon main alp maatra main paaya jaataa he, parantu ise calsikaran ke dwaara hataaya ja saktaa he
 Sulfur melts quickly in both liquid and solid states of iron at the temperature present in the smelting of iron
 sulfur yaa gandhak kii bahut kam maatra ke prabhaav taatkaalik or gambheer hote hai
 These were first worked by iron manufacturers
 sulfur louh ko laal banaata he or isse yah jaldi garm hota he
 When heated quickly, iron is brittle in hot state
 yah ek gambhir samasya thi kyonki 17 veen or 18 veen sadi ke dauraan prayukt louh dhalwaan louh yaa baar aayran hota tha
 The cast iron is repeatedly beaten with a hammer to give shape to the cast
 ek jaldi garm hone vaale louh kaa tukda hathaudaa maarane par tut jayega
 When a piece of hot iron or steel breaks, the exposed surface is immediately oxidized
 oxide kii yah parat welding dwaara daraar kii marammat karne main baadha pahunchaati he
 Larger cracks cause iron or steel to break
 choti daraaron ke karan vastu kaa samay par upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 How quickly it heats depends on the amount of sulfur present
 vartmaan main 0
 Iron containing more than 03% sulfur is not used
 jaldi garm hone vaala louh kaam kar saktaa he, lekin yah kam taapmaana par kaam karata he
 Working at low temperatures requires more physical effort than either Smith or the foremen
 aisa parinaam praapt karne ke liye dhaatu ko praapt karnaa adhik kathin hota he
 a bar with less sulfur may work, but it requires more time and effort
 kachche louh main sulfur safed louh ke nirmaan ko badhaava detaa he
 0 only
 5% tak maatra ke kaaran yah dhire dhire thanda hone lagata he or silicon kii ucch maatra
 White cast iron is more brittle, but also harder
 isse aam taur par bachaa jaataa he, kyonki is par kaam karnaa mushkil hota he, keval china ke alaava jahaan sulfur kii ucch maatra se yukt kaccha louh 0
 Contains 57%, it is made from coal and coke and is used to make bells and chimes
 Turner ke anusaar, achche foundry louh main 0
 15
 pratishat se kam sulfur hona chahie
 Casting iron with high sulfur may be used in the rest of the world, but it will create cast iron of poor quality
 sulfur sandushan ke upachaar ke kai tareeke hai
 The first and most commonly used prehistoric method in history is to avoid it
 china ke vipareet europe main koyale kaa upyog praglan ke liye eendhan ke rup main nahin kiya jaataa tha, kyonki isamen sulfur hota he or isliye iske kaaran louh jaldi garm ho jaataa he
 If an ore forms a metal that heats up quickly, the Ironmaster will search for another
 jab khanij koyale kaa sarvapratham upyog europea blast fernence main 1709 main kiya gaya, to isamen coke milaayaa jaataa he
 Raw coal was used from 1829 before the start of the hot blast
 sulfur ko ayask se roasting or washing hataaya ja saktaa he
 The sediment oxidizes the journey, producing sulfur dioxide, which either flies into the atmosphere or can be washed off
 garm jalwaayu main yah sambhav he kii pyritic ayask ko barsaat main chhod diya jaataa he
 With the combined effect of rain, bacteria and heat, sulfides are oxidized to form sulfates, which are soluble in water
 haalanki, aitihaasik rup se, louh sulphide, ek aam louh khanij he, iskaa upyog louh dhaatu ke utpaadan ke liye ek ayask ke rup main nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Natural weathering was used in Sweden
 yahi prakriya, bhuvaigyanik gati par, gossan lymonite ayask banaati he
 The importance of iron containing low sulfur is demonstrated by the consistently high prices for which iron was paid from Sweden, Russia and Spain from the 16th to 18th centuries
 vartmaan main sulfur koi samasya nahin he
 Modern treatment is the addition of manganese
 lekin, oparator ko pataa hona chahie ki louh main kitna sulfur he, kyonki mangneej kaa paanch guna isamen milaayaa janaa chahie, taaki yah ise niraveshit kar sake
 Some display historical iron manganese levels, but most are lower than the levels required to release sulfur

 The Magellanic Clouds are two clumsy dwarf galaxies that are satellites of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and are members of our local group of Sampiks galaxies
 inhen prithvi ke akaash main sirf dakshini golardh se dekha ja saktaa he
 The names of these two galaxies are - agar bina doorabeen ke prithvi ke dakshini golardh se majalanic badalon ko dekha jaae to yah akashganga ke bichade hue ansh lagate hai
 There is a distance of about 75,000 light-years between large and small magellanic clouds

 The larger magellanic cloud is about 14,000 light-years in size and the smaller one is only 7,000 light-years

 Scientists have come to the conclusion after a deep study of the magellanic clouds that both of these were once spindle spiral galaxies, which have been created by the galaxy's powerful gravity-induced tidal force, which have made bumpy galaxies

 == uddeshy == sukh or samridhi ke liye Millions of people lived in a city
 sabhi apane-apane kaamon main rat rahete the
 Nobody cared about anyone
 bhajan-kirthan, bhakthi-bhav, dayaa-maaya, paroapkaar jaise sanskaar kam ho gaye
 Evils had increased in the city
 sharaab, jua, res, vyabhichaar, chori-dakaiti vagairah bahut se gunaah shahar main hote the
 Despite these, some good people also lived in the city
 aise hi logon main shila or unke pati kii gruhasthi maani jaati thi
 Sheela was of a religious nature and a contented nature
 unka pati bhi viveki or susheel tha
 Sheela and her husband never used to do evil to anyone and Prabhu was spending time in Bhajan
 shahar ke log unki gruhasthi kii saraahna karte the
 It changed while watching
 shila kaa pati bure logon se dosti kar baitha
 Now he started dreaming of becoming a millionaire as soon as possible
 isliye vah galat raste par chal padaa falswaroop vah rodpati ban gaya
 That is, he had become like a beggar wandering on the way
 sharaab, jua, res, charas-ganja vagairah buree aadaton main shila kaa pati bhi fas gaya
 He also got used to alcohol with friends
 is prakaar usne apana sab kuch res-jue main ganvaa diya
 Sheela felt very sad due to her husband's behavior, but she began to suffer everything by trusting in God
 vah apana adhikansh samay prabhu bhakthi main bitaane lagi
 Suddenly one day someone knocked at his door
 shila ne dwaar kholaa to dekha ki ek maanji khadi thi
 Supernatural sharpness was building on his face
 unki aankhon main se maano amrit bah rahaa tha
 His grand face was filled with compassion and love
 usko dekhte hi shila ke man main apaar shanti chaa gai
 There was joy in Sheela's romance
 shila us maanji ko aadar ke saath ghar main le ai
 There was nothing to sit in the house
 atah shila ne sakuchaakar ek fatty hui chaddar par usko bithaaya
 Mother said - Why Sheila! Do not recognize me? Every Friday i also come there during the bhajan-kirtan in Lakshmiji's temple
 ' iske baavjood shila kuch samaj nahin paa rahi thi
 Then Manji said- 'you have not come to the temple for a long time, so i went to see you
 ' Sheela's heart melted with Manji's very loving words
 uski aankhon main ansu aa gaye or vah bilakh-bilkhakar rone lagi
 Manji said- 'daughter! Happiness and sorrow are like sunshine and shade
 dhairya rakho beti! mujhe teri sari pareshaani bataa
 Sheila got a lot of support from Manji's behavior and in the hope of happiness, she told her story to Manji
 kahani sunakar maanji ne kaha- 'karm kii gati nyaari hoti he
 Every human has to suffer his deeds
 isliye tu chintaa mat kar
 Now you have suffered karma
 ab tumhaare sukh ke din avashya aayenge
 You are a devotee of Goddess Lakshmi
 maan lakshmi to prem or karunaa kii avatar hai
 She always keeps affection on her devotees
 isliye tu dhairya rakhkar maan lakshmi kaa vrath kar
 This will fix everything
 ' On Sheela's asking, Manji also told her the whole method of fasting
 maanji ne kaha- 'beti! maan lakshmi kaa vrath bahut saral he
 She is called ‘varadalakshmi Vrat’ or ‘vaibhavalakshmi Vrat’
 yah vrath karne vaale kii sab manokamana purna hoti he
 He gets pleasure and wealth
 ' Sheela was happy to hear this
 shila ne sankalp karke ankhen kholi to saamne koi na tha
 She was amazed where Manji went? Sheela did not take any time to understand that Manji was none other than Lakshmi
 duusare din shuukravaar tha
 After bathing in the morning and wearing clean clothes, Sheela fasted whole heartedly with the method given by Manji
 aakhri main prasad vitaran hua
 This prasad was fed to the first husband
 prasad khate hi pati ke swabhaav main fark pad gaya
 That day he did not hit Sheela, he did not even persecute
 shila ko bahut anand hua
 In his mind, reverence for 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' increased
 shila ne purna shraddha-bhakthi se ikkis shuukravaar tak 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kiya
 According to the instructions of Manji on the twenty-first Friday, by doing the Udyan Vidhi, seven women gifted seven books of 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat'
 phir mataji ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko vandan karke bhav se man hi man prarthana karne lageen- 'he maan dhanalakshmi! maine aapkaa 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' karne kii mannath maani thi, vah vrath aaj purna kiya he
 Hey mother! Remove all my troubles
 hamaara sabakaa kalyaan karo
 To give birth to someone who does not have children
 saubhagyawati stri kaa saubhaahgya akhand rakhana
 To give a pleasing husband to a virgin girl
 jo aapkaa yah chamatkaari vaibhavalakshmi vrath kare, unki sab vipatti dur karnaa
 Make everyone happy
 he maan! aapaki mahima apaar he
 Saying this, i saluted the image of Lakshmiji's 'dhanalakshmi Swaroop'
 vrath ke prabhaav se shila kaa pati acha aadmi ban gaya or kadi mehnat karke vyavsaay karne laga
 He immediately rescued Sheila's mortgaged jewelry
 ghar main dhan kii baadh si aa gai
 The same happiness and peace took place in the house
 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kaa prabhaav dekhakar mohalle kii duusari striyaan bhi vidhipurvak 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' karne lageen
 Vaibhavalakshmi Vrat 'vidyapana Vidyasat, eleven or twenty-one, as many as Fridays are requested, this fast should be done with full devotion and devotion till Friday
 aakhri shuukravaar ko iskaa shastreey vidhi ke anusaar udhyapan karnaa chahie
 Kheer should be prepared for Prasad on the last Friday
 jis prakaar har shuukravaar ko ham pujan karte hai, vaise hi karnaa chahie
 After worshiping, in front of the mother, break a quince, then at least seven virgin girls or lucky women should gift a copy of the book of Maa Vaibhavalakshmi Vrat Katha by applying a tilak of Kumkum and offer kheer to everyone
 iske baad maan lakshmi ko shraddha sahit pranaam karnaa chahie
 Then after worshiping the image of Mother's' Dhanalakshmi Swaroop ', pray in your mind with a feeling -' o Mother Dhanalakshmi! i made a vow to do 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', that fast is completed today
 he maan! hamaari manokamana purna karen
 Remove all our troubles
 hamaara sabakaa kalyaan karo
 To give birth to someone who does not have children
 saubhagyawati stri kaa saubhaahgya akhand rakhana
 To give a pleasing husband to a virgin girl
 jo aapkaa yah chamatkaari vaibhavalakshmi vrath kare, unki sab vipatti dur karnaa
 Make everyone happy
 he maan! aapaki mahima apaar he
 ' Hail to you! Saying this, bow to the image of Lakshmiji's 'dhanalakshmi Swaroop'
