 According to another legend, King Divodas, son of Maharaja Sudev, had established Varanasi city on the banks of the Ganges
 ek baar bhagwaan shankar ne dekha ki parvati ji ko apane maayke main rahane main sankoch hota he, to unhone kisi duusare siddhakshetramen rahane kaa vichaar banaaya
 He found Kashi very popular
 ve yahaan aa gaye
 With the desire of Lord Shiva to live in harmony, the gods also started living in Kashi
 raja divodas apni rajdhani kaashi kaa aadhipaty kho jane se bade du:khee hue
 He sought a boon from Brahmaji by performing rigorous penance - May the deity be in Devlok, Bhlok be for humans

 kaashi kaa itnaa mahatmaya he ki sabase bade puraana skandamahapurana main kashikhand ke naam se ek vistrut pruthak vibhaag hi he
 The twelve well-known names of this Puri are Kashi, Varanasi, Avimukta Kshetra, Anandakanan, Mahashmashan, Rudravas, Kashika, Tapa: Sthali, Muktabhumi, Shivpuri, Tripurairajanagari and Vishwanathanagari
 skandapurana kaashi kii mahima kaa gun-gaan karte hue kahata he- Which, despite being on the ground floor, is not associated with the earth, which, despite being bound by the boundaries of the world, is the one to reap the bondage of all, who is adorned on the banks of the Ganges and decorated with the gods, the capital of Tripurari Lord Vishwanath, that Kashi is the whole world
 Protect sanathan dharm ke granthon ke adhyayan se kaashi kaa lokottar swaroop vidit hota he
 It is said that this Puri is situated on the trident of Lord Shankar
 at: pralay hone par bhi iskaa naash nahin hota he
 It is also called Varanasi because it is inhabited by five Kos between the rivers Varuna and Asi
 kaashi naam kaa arth bhi yahi he-jahaan brahm prakashit ho
 Lord Shiva never leaves Kashi
 jahaan deh tyaagane maatr se praani mukt ho jaay, vah avimukt kshetra yahi he
 Sanatan religions have a strong belief that Lord Shankar narrates Tarakamantra to a death-oriented creature during his death in Kashi
 isse jeev ko tatvagyan ho jaataa he or uske saamne apana brahmaswaroop prakashit ho jaataa he
 The epigraph of the scriptures is- kaashi main kahin par bhi mrityu ke samay bhagwaan vishweshwar praaniyon ke daahine kaan main tarak mantra kaa upadesh dete hai
 After listening to the Tarakamantra, the organism becomes free from bondage
 yah manyata he ki keval kaashi hi sidhe mukti detii he, jabaki anya tirthasthan kaashi kii prapti karake moksh pradaan karte hai
 In this context, it is also written in Kashikhand- aisa isliye he ki paanch kos kii sampurna kaashi hi vishwa ke adhipati bhagwaan vishwanath kaa aadhibhautik swaroop he
 Kashikhand considers the entire Kashi as the form of Jyotirlinga
 paanch kos pariman ke avimukt naamak kshetra ko vishweshwar sanjyak jyotirling-swaroop maananaa chahie
 Many scholarly scholars have written and said a lot supporting the theory of Kashi Marananmukti
 ramakrishna mishan ke swami sharadanandji dwaara likhit shriramkrishna-leelaprasang naamak pustak main shriramkrishna paramhans dev kaa is vishay main pratyaksh anubhav varnit he
 That parable reveals the truth of Baba Vishwanath granting Tarakamantra to the deceased in Kashi
 lekin yahaan yah bhi baat dhyaan rahe ki kaashi main paap karne vaale ko maranoparant mukti milane se pehle atibhyankar bhairavi yatnaa bhi bhogani padati he

 Falgun shukla-ekadashi is called Rangabhari Ekadashi in Kashi
 is din baba vishwanath kaa vishesh shringaar hota he or kaashi main holi kaa parvakaal prarambh ho jaataa he
 The journey of Muktadayinikashi, the abode and death here and the cremation of the fortunes are attained only by the grace of the virtues of previous lives and by the grace of Baba Vishwanath
 tabhi to kaashi kii stuti main kaha gaya he- Vishwanathji's very best city, Kashi, is derived from the glory of the virtues of previous births
 yahaan sharir chhodne par praaniyon ko mukti avashya milti he
 Kashi is the city of Baba Vishwanath
 kaashi ke adhipati bhagwaan vishwanath kehete hai- idan mam priyankshetran panchakroshiparimitam
 This area, spanning five Kos, is very dear to me
 patit-paavani kaashi main sthit vishweshwar jyotirling sanatankaal se hinduon ke liye param aradhy he, kintu jansadharan is tathy se praaia: anbhigya hi he ki yah jyotirling paanch kos tak vistaar liye hue he- panchakroshaatmakan linganjyotirupansanatanam
 Gyanarupa Panchakroshivik | It is also known by the name of Punyakshetra Kashi - Gyanarupa Tukashiyan Panchkroshaparimita
 padmapurana main likhaa he ki sristi ke prarambh main jis jyotirligka brahma or vishnuji ne darshan kiya, use hi veda or sansar main kaashi naam se pukaara gaya- The Kashi of the five Kos is Chaitanya form
 isliye yah pralay ke samay bhi nasht nahin hoti
 There is a clear mention in this context in the ancient Brahmavaikarta Purana that the immortal sages ask Sri Sanatana Mahavishnu during the Holocaust - o Lord! Mahavishnu said - o sages! When we remembered Lingarupadhari Sadasivamahadeva for the welfare of the three worlds, then that Sambhu came out of our heart in the form of a bit of a linga and then he became five Kos with increasing growth - yah kaashi vahi panchakroshaatmakajyotirlighai
 This plot is found in the second chapter of Kashirhasya
 skandapuranake kashikhandamein swayan bhagwaan shiv yah ghoshnaa karte hai- Consider the entire Panchakroshvikhetika, a Jyotirlinga called Vishveshwar, which is the Mahakshetra called Avicamut of five Kosas magnitude
 isi kaaran kaashi pralay hone par bhi nasht nahin hoti
 In Kashi Khand, Lord Shankar tells the abode of Baba Vishwanath in the entire Kashi of five Kos- jaise suryadev ek jagah sthit hone par bhi sab ko dikhaai dete hai, vaise hi sampurna kaashi main sarvatra baba vishwanath kaa hi darshan hota he
 Vishveshwara himself also calls his Puri of the Five Kos as his own form - Panchakrosya Parimitatanureshapuri Mum
 kaashi kii seemaa ke vishay main shastron kaa kathan he-asee- varanyormadhye panchakroshmahataram
 There is great glory of the area of five Kos situated between the rivers Asi and Varuna

 panchakroshaat makajyotirlig-swaroopakashi sampoorn vishwa ke swami shri vishwanath kaa nivas-sthaan hone se bhav-bandhan se muktidaayini he
 It has also been said in the scriptures - Kashi death anniversary
 kaashi kii parikrama karne se sampoorn prithvi kii pradakshina kaa punyafal praapt hota he
 The devotee becomes free from all sins and becomes holy
 teen panchakroshi-parikrama karne vaale ke janm-janmaantar ke sabhi paap nasht ho jate hai
 Kashi residents should do panchkosi-parikrama at least once a year because sins committed in other places are consumed in the merits of the pilgrimage of Kashi, but the destruction of sins in Kashi is possible only through panchkosi-pradakshina
 kaashi main sadachaar-sanyam ke saath dharm kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 It is not a place of tourism but a holy place of pilgrimage
 vastut:kaashi or vishweshwar jyotirligmein tatvat:koi bhed nahin he
 Of course, the entire Kashi is the form of Baba Vishwanath
 kaashi-mahatmaya main rishiyon kaa udghosh he-kaashi sarvapivishveshrupininathrasanshay:
 Therefore, do not be skeptical to consider Kashi as Vishwanathji and chant daily with devotion - Shiva: Kashi Shiva: Kashi, Kashi Kashi Shiva: Shiva

 Where does the biological neural network in neuroscience refer to a group of neurons that are used to exchange information with the brain
 is soochna kaa prasaaran ek vidyut-rasinic prakriya ke dwaara hota he
 It can be divided into two classes: kendriya tantrika tantra ko mastishk meru tantrika tantra bhi kehete hai
 It consists of 12 pairs of anterior brain, midbrain, posterior brain, cerebellum, paunas, thalamus, spinal cord, spinal cord and cerebral nerves and 31 pairs of spinal nerves
 mastishk caroti guha main rahata he tathaa teen kalaon se, jinhen tantrikas kehete hai aavruth rahata he
 There is a liquid in the middle of the inner two arts, which is called Merudrava
 yah taral mastishk ke bheetar pai janevaali guhaaon main tathaa meru kii nalika main bhi rahata he
 The spinal cord is located in the vertebral canal and is covered with meninges
 yah taral in angon ko poshan detaa he, inaki raksha karata he tathaa malon kaa visarjan karata he
 In the brain, there is a gray side on the outside and a white part on the inside and just in reverse it stays in the meru
 mastishk kaa dhoosar bhaag sitaaon ke dwaara kai silavaton se yukt rahata he
 In this gray part there are nerve cells and the white part is of connective tissue
 tantrikas do prakaar kii hoti hai : prerak tathaa samvedi 
 Following are the names of the twelve nerve joints of the brain: ghran tantrika, Vision nerve, akshiprerak tantrika, Circulatory nerve, trik tantrika, The parasternal nerve, aanan tantrika, auditory nerve, jihva kanthika tantrika, vagus nerve , meru sahayika tantrika tathaa Epigastric nerve

 In Meru, sensory and cetavas are nerve roots
 agr mastishk do golardhon main vibhajit rahata he tathaa iske bheetar do guhaayen rahati hai jinhen pashrviya nilay kehete hai
 Sensory nerves transmit all sensations of the body to the brain and sensory nerves take commands from there and work with the organs
 kendriya tantrikas vishesh kaaryon ke liye hoti hai
 All these nerves have sub center and upper center
 jab kuch kriyaayein ad: centre kar dete hai tathaa pasch udhrv kendron ko gyaan praapt hota he, tab aisi kriyaaon ko prativarti kriyaayein kehete hai
 These actions are done from the nerves originating from the meru and the meru centers
 mastishk kaa bhaar 40 ounce hota he
 The arteries of the brain are internal arteries, so when they are blocked, or they are destroyed, the concerned part stops getting nourishment, due to which the center does not function, so the controlled activities are blocked from that center
 
 ise hi pakshaaghaat kehete hai
 It works voluntarily
 isamen ek duusare ke viruddh kaary karanevaali anukanpi tathaa sahanukanpi, do prakaar kii tantrikas rahati hai

 The tools that helped people in calculating were at that time called "calculating machines" by proprietary names or even as they are now called calculators
 These were the same people who used machines that were called computers at the time; There are photographs of spacious rooms filled with tables holding computers on which to carry out joint work with their machines, for example, the design of the aircraft required an aerodynamic type
 calculator kaa vikaas nirantar hota rahaa he lekin computer main sashart pratikriya or adhiktam smriti ke mahatvapurn tatv ko joda gaya he jo sankhyatmak pariklan ke swachaalan or saamanytah sanketon main pherbadal ke kai kaaryon ke swachaalan, donon kii anumati dete hai

 The analog computer was similar to that designed by Vannevar Bush before World War II
 yaa, sankhyaon ko ankon ke rup main nirupit kiya ja saktaa he jise ek yantric prakriya dwaara swatah pherbadal kar liya jaataa he
 While this previous approach required a far more complex process in many cases, it was designed to have greater precision of results

 Wilhelm Schickard, a German polymath, designed a calculating clock in 1623, unfortunately during its construction in 1624 a fire destroyed it and Shickard abandoned the project
 Two of its sketches were discovered in 1957; But by then it was so late that it could not have any effect on the development of mechanical calculators
 1642 main ek kishor hone ke baavjood blage pascal ne abhikalan mashiinon par kuch pathpradarshak kaary karnaa shuru kiya or teen saalon ke prayaas evam 50 prototipon ke baad unhone yantric calculator kaa avishkaar kiya

 Leibniz once said, "it is useless for a wise man to waste hours working as a slave in calculations that can be safely transferred to another person when machines are used
" 1820 ke aasapaas charles jevirs thomas ne pehla safal, bade paimaane par utpaadit yantric calculator, thomas arithemometer taiyaar kiya tha, jo jod, gata, guna or bhaag kar saktaa tha
 It was mainly based on Leibniz's work

 At the international level, generally, all countries import and export goods, exchange services and exchange money
 is prakaar ek nishchit avadhi ke pashchaat in sabhi madon par len dein kaa yadi hisaab nikaala jaay to kisi ek desh ko duusare se bhugtan lenaa shesh hota he or duusare desh ko kisi kisi tisare desh kaa bhugtan chukaana shesh rahata he
 The balance of such mutual transactions between different countries is called balance of payments
 yon kahana chahie ki kisi nishchit tithi ko ek desh dwaara anya deshon ko chukaai janevaali sakal raashi tathaa anya deshon se use praapt honevaali sakal raashi ke antar ko us desh kaa 'bhugtan shesh' kehete hai
 The right and opportunity for any one country to receive payment from other countries comes when that country exports goods to those countries, or provides its services by its ships, banks, insurance companies and skilled experts or in the trade of industries of those countries
 Get dividend and interest by investing your capital
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki us desh ke dwaara anya deshon ko die gaye rinon kii mulrashi kaa use bhugtan praapt hota ho yaa anya deshon se hi use rin swaroop raashi milti ho
 Apart from this, it is also possible that country tourists from other countries come to that country to buy goods or consume services
 in sabhi paristhitiyon main us desh ko anya deshon se bhugtan praapt karne kaa avasar hoga
 On the contrary, it is possible that the same country has to repay some of the payment of other countries
 is prakaar kisi ek tithi ko in sabhi madon par ek desh kii safal lendaree kaa antar nikaalane se us desh kaa bhugtan shesh gyaat ho jaayga
 Although this type of transaction between countries keeps going on some item continuously, but if the difference of transactions of different countries of a country is determined on a certain date, then one of the following circumstances definitely arises
 : is prakaar bhugtan shesh 'anukool', 'pratikul' va 'santulit' yaa 'paksh' main, 'vipaksh' main or 'baraabar' kaha jaataa he
 But its relationship with a particular country should be expressed in a relative sense
 yah kahana sarthak nahin ki bhugtan shesh anukool, pratikul va santulit he; varan yah kahana hoga ki amuk tithi ko yaa amuk avadhi main amuk desh kaa bhugtan shesh uske anukool he, pratikul he athwa santulit he
 In extracting the balance of payments, not only the excess of import and export of goods is known as 'trade balance' but also the difference of gross liability and gross liability from all the items mentioned above
 len dein ke nirantar kram main bhugtan shesh anivaaryat: santulit ho jaataa he par kisi thithivishesh ko kisi desh kaa bhugtan shesh uske anukool yaa pratikul hi paaya jaataa he
 The remaining favorable and favorable payment of a country is considered to reflect the internal economic situation of that country
 yadi bhugtan shesh anukool rahaa to iskaa arth hoga us desh dwaara niryaat kaa bahulya, utpaadan kii prachurtaa, udyog vyapaar kii sabalata, videshi mudra kii kamai or raashtra ke swarnakosh main vruddhi
 Conversely, adverse balance of payments will mean the multiplicity of imports, the laxity of the trade industry, the decline in production, the lack of appropriation, the depletion of foreign exchange and the gold reserves of the nation
 aayojan va vikaas ke vartmaan yug main viksit deshon se poonjigat maal evam kushal visheshgyon kii aavashyak maatra aayaat karne ke hetu yah anivaary ho gaya he ki bhugtan shesh desh ke paksh main arthath anukool bana rahe
 Today every country is constantly trying for this purpose

 In normal life, many spelling mistakes in Hindi are seen on computer, internet and letters
 ashuddh vartanee bhashaa kii sundarata ko kharaab karti he
 Therefore, this article talks about common mistakes made in Hindi
 ye ve ashuddhiyaan hai jo aamtaur computer athwa anya computing divison par typing ke dauraan hoti hai
 In English these types of impurities are called typos
 kai baar to in par tipakarta kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa, kai baar dhyaan jane par bhi aalasyavash vah najrandaaj kar detaa he
 Another reason is also that many times the typing tool is not aware of the type of character or mark by the typing tool being used
 aisa suvidha ke chakkar main, kisi chihn ko tip karne kaa sahi tarika na jaanane ke kaaran athwa chihn vishesh ko tip karne kii sulabhta uplabdh na hone ke kaaran hota he
 While typing on a computer, most people use fullstop instead of a full stop because of laziness or not knowing how to type the character
 purnaviram ke sthaan par phulstop kaa prayog karne se devanagari kii sundarata bhi prabhavit hoti he tathaa computing main anya jatiltaayen bhi aati hai
 In Hindi, space does not come before any punctuation marks such as a full stop, question mark etc
 aajkal kai mudrit pustakon, patrikaon main aisa hone ke kaaran log aisa hi tip karne lagate hai jo ki galat he
 Space should not come before any punctuation
 angreji main sankshepikaran ke liye phulstop kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, hindi main is kaary ke liye laghav chihn hota he
 Often this icon is not accessible on the keyboard, people use fullstop instead, when it is impure
 is chihn ko tip karne kaa saralatam tarika he ki kisi bhi verde prosesar main iske unicode kuta 0970 ko tip karen tathaa use salact karke alt-x dabaa den, vah laghav chihn main badal jaayegaa
 Example: True - Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, Incorrect - Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, True - m A, f - M
 a
 hindi shunya ank kaa chihn bhi isse miltaa-julata hone se kai baar log galati se laghav chihn kii jagah hindi ke shunya ank kaa prayog kar lete hai
 The difference in these is that one minus the minus sign is smaller than the other zero, where the horizontal sign is in the middle of the line, the minus sign is horizontally down
 kai log jaankaree ke abhaav main sanskrit main shlokon ke ant main likhe jane vaale dabl dande ke sahi chihn ke sthaan par do purnaviram daal dete hai
 If you do not have this symbol in your typing tool to enter the correct mark, then type its Unicode code 0965 in any word processor and select it and press alt-x, it will be converted into double sentence
 vaakya-ant hetu purnaviram / dand nirdhaarit he
 a double-sentence is prescribed for the end of the paragraph, the norm of which will be more scientifically and technically accurate if double sentence is typed at the end of rhyme in the poem / verse, but at the end of each paragraph
 kai baar tipakarta visarg ke sthaan par usase milte julate chihn colon ko tip kar dete hai jo ki sarvatha ashuddh he
 Standard Hindi keyboard inscript can be obtained by pressing the key - with the Visarg Shift
 anya vikalp ke taur par kisi bhi verde prosesar main iske unicode code 0903 ko tip karen tathaa use salact karke alt-x dabaa den, vah visarg chihn main badal jaayegaa
 Many times the typers type the decimal mark fullstop instead of the decimal mark which is completely impure
 in donon kaa antar dekhnaa ho to donon ko kisi verde prosesar main tip kar font sies bahut bada karke dekhen
 Middle Dot should be used for the decimal sign which is above the Del key in the Numerical Keypad
 jabaki Full stop ke liye sirf code nirdhaarit he
 Due to lack of proper knowledge of Panchamaksharas, people often misuse the word 'N' instead of half their letters like 'pandit' instead of 'pandit', 'windows' instead of 'windows', 'chanchal'
 'chanchal' etc
 in place of ye adhiktar ashuddhiyaan 'ji' tathaa 'n' ke sthaan par 'n' ke prayog kii hoti hai
 Rule: If there is a sound of reminder before the first four letters of every alphabet group of the alphabet, then the fifth letter of that class seems to be halved
 arthath kavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha ng, chavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha na, tavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha na, tavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha na tathaa pavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha m aata he
 Examples: aadhunik hindi main panchamaaksharon ke sthaan par suvidha hetu keval anuswaar kaa bhi prayog kar liya jaataa he yadhyapi yah devanagari kii sundarata ko kam karata he
 Such as: Pankaj - Pankaj, Shanti - Shanti, Tradition - Tradition
 visheshkar na tathaa ji kaa prayog kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 According to the tradition of Wikipedia, Panchamakshars should be used in articles related to Sanskrit, Religion and Indian Culture whereas modern Hindi can be used for simplicity in articles related to science, mathematics, technology etc
 haan lekh ke sheershak ko shuddh uccharan tathaa vartanee kii drushti se panchamakshar main rakhaa jaay, chaahe vah kisi bhi vishay se sambandhit ho
 For search and redirection, the modern spelling name should be redirected to the title with the traditional signature so that it is pure pronunciation and spelling
 udhaaharan ke liye pandit ko pandit par punarnirdeshit kiya janaa chaiye
 It is only appropriate to use the input sound "A" or pure spelling after its volume because the point of the reminder is not visible in it
 udhaaharan - font ke sthaan par font upyukt he
 Similarly, even after the second incoming sound "ऍ" and its volume, the point of the reminder is either not visible or there is confusion of the moon, so the use of pure spelling in its place is also appropriate
 udhaaharan - and ke sthaan par and upyukt he
 In the conjuncts formed by the treaty of Pancham Varna, the latter letter appears below "J" and "J"
 is prakaar banane vaale sanyuktakshron ko mangal aadi adhiktar unicode font sahi prakaar se nahin dikhaa pate, baayin taraf dikhaate hai
 The Unicode font named Sanskrit 2003 correctly displays such conjuncts
 udhaaharan - ganga kaa sahi rup he
 Writing mistake: Both 'A' and 'O' are called incoming sounds which have come from foreign languages especially English in Hindi
 inkaa upyog angreji kii do vishisht dhvaniyon ke liye hota he
 The sound of 'au' is almost between 'o' and 'au', eg: boss, hot etc
 bahudhaa log saamaanya lekhan main bhi tathaa computer padd tankan me bhi '' ke sthaan par '' likh dete hai
 This is due to two reasons, one is that Indians are unable to assimilate them many times due to foreign sounds and secondly due to lack of 'A' sign in the typing tool on the computer
 kai baar typing aujaar main sulabh hone par bhi log aalasyavash 'aa' kii hi maatra laga dete hai
 However, there are some words whose forms of 'aa' are also prevalent in Hindi, such as doctors and colleges
 in maamalon main 'aa' vaala rup bhi chal jaataa he kyonki inkaa 'aa' vaala uccharan bhi prachlit he, yadhyapi 'o' vaala hi likhnaa behatar he
 But it is totally wrong to write words that have only the sound of 'A' as 'A'
 udhaaharan ke liye internet par 'blog' ko bahudhaa galat rup se 'blog' likh diya jaataa he yadhyapi 'blog' bolta koi nahin
 Pronunciation mistake: Since 'A' is a foreign sound, many Indians are unable to assimilate it and pronounce the words 'A' as 'A'
 udhaaharan ke liye 'ol' ke sthaan par 'aal', 'olso' ke sthaan par 'aalso', 'body' ke sthaan par 'bari' aadi
 Input sound is almost between 'ऍ', 'A' and 'A', eg 'jack', 'mack'
 hindi main aamtaur par iske liye nikatatam varna 'i' kaa upyog kar liya jaataa he jaise 'jak' kii bajaay 'jaik' aadi
 It is not so impure but the use of the quantity of 'A' in place of 'ऍ' is totally inappropriate and is against Devanagari's phonetic quality - pronunciation and symmetry of writing
 is tarah ke galat prayog ke udhaaharan hai 'red' ke sthaan par 'red' likhnaa jo ki Raid kaa sahi lekhan he
 Similarly, writing 'test' in place of 'test' which is the correct writing of Taste, 'guest' instead of 'gast' which is wrong
 ek anya ashuddhi jo ki print media main dekhne ko milti he - 'ji' ke sthaan par 'a' ke upar '' chihn laga varna
 It is not possible to create such a character in a Unicode font but is created in a non-unicode font
 aisi galati aam taur par 'ji' se shuru hone vaale varnon main dikhaayi detii he
 Often, anusvara is written in place of anusvara and in place of anuasik
 visheshkar anunasik ke sthaan par anuswaar ko likhe jane kii galati adhik prachlit he or ise ek prakaar kii aghoshit sweekruti bhi mil gayi he
 Some examples are, laughing instead of laughing, feathers instead of feathers etc
 in donon ke antar ko spasht karne ke liye bahudhaa hans tathaa hans kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 See information related to the use of Anusarav and Anusani here
 urdu se hindi main liye gayi shabdon main nukta lagaaya jaataa he
 Apart from this, nukte is also used in some words of foreign languages like English
 nukta bhashaa vishesh kii sahi dhwani ko prakat karata he lekin hindi main likhte samay praayah kai baar log nukta lop kar dete hai
 Although this is not considered a serious mistake
 nukta chhod dena vishesh notice nahin kiya jaataa lekin jahaan nukta na laganaa ho vahaan laga dena ajeeb lagata he jaise 'fal' ke sthaan par 'fal' tathaa 'phir' ke sthaan par 'fir' saraasar galat he
 Typing is also one of the reasons for needlessly pointing
 udhaaharan ke liye baraa ikhmai naamak aujaar se tip karte samay 'F' kunji dabaane se 'fa' chhapata he jabaki 'pha' ke liye 'P+H' dabaanaa padataa he
 That is why many people become habituated to writing 'F' by 'F' idlely
 kai baar nukta aprihaary bhi ho saktaa he
 See an example: The English letter 'G' is pronounced 'G', and 'Z' is pronounced 'zee'
 in donon ke uccharan kaa antar nukte bina spasht nahin ho saktaa
 Another suggestion is that while there is a possibility of changing the meaning, a deflector like nukta should be used
 jahaan bina nukte ke arth sahi samajha ja sake, vahaan bina nukte ke kaam chalaaya janaa chahie
 a general rule about the tip should be remembered - yes, there is doubt about the use of the tip, do not use the tip there
 'zarurat' ke sthaan par 'jarurat' chal jayega, par 'majaburi' ke sthaan par 'mazaboori' nahin
 See this article for the correct use of nukte
 hindi main bahut se shabd hai jinaki vartanee aam taur par galat likhi jaati he
 Due to the presence of these spells in the print media, the common man starts to understand them correctly
 uparokt mukhya lekh main is prakaar ke shabdon kii suchi di gayi he
 a -> Cai, b -> Khai etc
 kai log 'sha' tathaa 'sha' kaa uccharan bhi 'sa' kii tarah hi karte hai jaise 'inglish' ko 'inglis' bolnaa, 'shadyantra' ko 'sadyantra' bolnaa aadi
 'R' is pronounced as 'ri' in North India and 'ru' in South India
 iskaa sahi uccharan kalkram main lupt ho chukaa he
 'gy' is pronounced differently in different parts of India, it is often pronounced as 'gy' in the Hindi language regions of North India
 iskaa sahi uccharan bhi vartmaan main lupt ho chukaa he
 Nowadays, the pronunciation of 'ksh' is generally heard like 'chhath' as in saying 'kshatriya' as 'chhatriya'
 praayah panchamaaksharon se aparichit log 'ng' kaa uccharan 'd' kii tarah karte hai
 Some people pronounce half the letters in some words as full letters
 udhaaharan ke liye 'prashn' kaa uccharan 'prashan' kii tarah, 'mahatv' kaa uccharan 'mahatav' kii tarah, 'praytn' kaa uccharan 'prayatan' kii tarah aadi
 There are many words that had different meanings, but they have started being used in a different sense than being misinterpreted
 udhaaharan ke liye kilaafat kaa arth "caliph kaa pad or uski satta" hota he lekin aam janata jisamen padhe-likhe patrkaar bhi shaamil hai, kilaafat ko mukaalifat ke arth main hi dhadlle se istemaal kar rahe hai

 The concept of 'power' and 'power' is the basic concept of sociology, political sociology and political science
 maanav ke saarvajanik or raajnneetik vyavhaar ko samajhane main is avadharana kaa athulaneey mahatv he
 Although these two are used as synonyms, they have specific meaning in political sociology
 prayek raajnneetik vyavastha main shakti keval kuch logon athwa alpsankhyak samooh main hi kendrit hoti he
 How does it happen? As a result of efforts to find the answer to these questions in political sociology, the principles related to elite have developed
 abhijaat siddhanth is tathy par aadhaarit hai ki prayek samaaj main mote taur par do bhinn varg paye jate hai- ek, thode yaa alpsankhyak logon kaa varg jo apni kshamta ke aadhaar par samaaj ko sarvocch netritv pradaan karata he tathaa shashan karata he, tathaa doosraa, jan-samooh yaa asankhya saadhaaranjanon kaa varg, jiske bhagya main shasit hona likhaa he
 The first class is called the elite class and the second one is called the mass group
 abhijan kii avadharana ko pehle keval raajnneetik drushti se hi dekha jaataa tha tathaa keval shaasha varg evam shaktishaalee abhijanon kii ore dhyaan diya jaataa tha, parantu aaj aisa nahin hai
 Today, among the elite, powerful elite class, capitalist class, military elite, ruling class, intellectual class, bureaucrats and managers are also included
 shakti ke asmaan vitaran ke atirikt saamaajik starikaran ke adhyayanon ne bhi abhijan siddhanton ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Today, the theory of eligibility is considered a fundamental theory in political science, sociology and political sociology
 yah sanpratyay saamaajik-raajnneetik yatharth ko samajhane main kaaphi mahatvapurn he kyonki prayek samaaj main kisi na kisi prakaar kaa saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik sanstaran paaya jaataa he
 The term Abhijana was used in the seventeenth century to mean special and best things or qualities, in which sense the word Vajra was used for high level individuals such as crack soldier squads or aristocrats
 unnisvin shatabdi ke ant tak is shabd kaa prayog saamaajik evam raajnneetik lekhon main vyapak rup se nahin hua tha
 After the Second World War in the twentieth century, the concept of elite and its principles became very popular in Western countries and America and since then the concept of elite became widely used in social science
the names of scholars abhijan siddhanton ke saath parato, moska, si0 rhite mills, edward shills, shumpiter, roberta michels, james bernaham, remand eran, karl mainhim, herold laswell ityadi vidwano ke naam jude hue hai
 Here, a brief discussion of the views of some prominent scholars will be appropriate
 wilfredo parato ne abhijan ko paribhaashit karte hue kaha he ki prayek vishisht maanviya kriya main agar ham vyaktiyon kii gatividhiyon ke kshetra ke suchakon ko ank de den to jo vyakti sarvocch ank praapt karte hai, unhen abhijan kaha jaataa he
 In other words, elites include all successful individuals who are supreme in every activity and at every level of society
 inke shabdon main jin vyaktiyon ko kisi vishisht maanviya gatividhi ke kshetra main sarvocch ank milen yadi unka ek varg banaaya jaay to us varg ko abhijan varg kaa naam de sakate hai
 Gitano Mosca is the first scholar to have used the words 'abhijana' and 'people' in a specific sense
 inke shabdon main, sabhi samaajon main un samaajon se lekar jinka abhi bahut kam vikaas hua he or jo abhi tak sabhyataa kii pehali kirnon kaa sansparsh bhi thik se nahin kar paye hai, un samaajon tak jo sabase adhik viksit evam shaktishaalee he, sabhi samaajon main keval do prakaar ke virgon ke log paye jate hai
 One, the people of that class who rule and the other, who are ruled, the people of the first class, despite being a minority, control all kinds of political work in their hands, all power is concentrated in their hands and power They get the benefit of the benefits of the second class, while the second class being the majority, the first class, sometimes in legitimate ways and sometimes in more or less amount of arbitrary And remains guided and controlled in violent ways
 moska ke anusaar sabhi prakaar ke shashan main niyantran sadaiv se sambhrant varg ke haath main hota he
 Also, there is some quality in the ruling class due to which it is considered to be respected and influential in the society, even if those qualities are real or merely remain as mere appearances
 herold di0 laswell ne raajnneetik abhijanon par vishesh dhyaan diya he
 In his words, political elite consists of the ruling body of the political body
 sattadhariyon main vah netritv tathaa saamaajik rachana bhi sammilit he jisamen netaaon kaa udbhav hota he tathaa jiske prati kisi nishchit avadhi tak ve uttaradaayi hote hai
 Raymond S
 has also considered the elite class like Lasswell as the ruling class, which is in small numbers
 inhone abhijan varg evam anya samaajik virgo ke bich sambandh sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya he tathaa buddhijivi abhijanon ke saamaajik prabhaav kaa vivechan kiya he jo ki raajnneetik satta kii vyavastha kaa ang nahin hote
 TB Botomore has disagreed with the views of the above scholars on the ground that they have not paid any attention to the ideology contained in the doctrine of eligibility
 botomor ke anusaar abhijan kii avadharana prajatantr ke mahatv ke virodh main viksit hui he
 According to him, the term 'abhijana' is generally being used in fact for functional, mainly business groups, which have a high status in society
 inke vichaaron main adhik naveen kaal ke samajashastriyon ne abhijan shabd kaa prayog adhik chote va adhik sangathit samoohon ke liye kiya he jo kam athwa adhik rup se parsparik rup se sayukt saamaajik virgon se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 In Batomore's view, Raymond Aron is the only scholar who has studied relations among the elite and has tried to explain that the elimination of classes will not solve the problem of social stratification, creation of elite and inequalities of political power
 duusare shabdon main abhijanon kaa astitv prayek prakaar ke samaaj evam raajnneetik vyavastha main bana rahegaa
 It is clear from the above discussion that there is no one common definition of eligibility and that the elites generally include those people who are socially, economically and politically higher than other people, ie the general public
 It is known that there are different types of elite such as ruling class, powerful elite, intellectual class, Rbndhk, bureaucrats and military officers and so on

 "possessive birwan's lips scream", this saying perfectly fits Acharya Rai
 baarah varsh kii aayu main, jab bachche pariyon kii kahani kaa anand lete hai, unhen galileo or sar ijak newton jaise vaigyanikon kii jivaniyaan padhane kaa shauk tha
 Due to this attachment to science, F

 He received the degree of Doctor of Science in 1887 while studying chemistry in this university
 iske baad bhi "hope prise skalaruship" paakar ve vahiin par ek varsh tak shodh karte rahe
 When he returned to India in 1888, higher studies of chemistry were starting here
 ek varsh ke antaraal ke baad unki niyukti presidency kalege ke rasayan vibhaag main sahaayak pravaktaa ke pad par ho gai
 Here he continued to do research and retired in 1916 after becoming the spokesperson and head of the department
 iske uparaant bhi unhone rasayan kaa kshetra choda nahin or kolkata vishvavidhyalay ke science kalege main professor ke pad par kaary karte rahe
 He was the first Indian to have the honor of becoming a "professor" in a university
 yahaan ve 1936 tak sakriy rahe or baad main bhi 1944 main antim saans lene tak "amerits professor" kaa pad sushobhit karte rahe
 Acharya Rai was a devoted karmayogi
 unke man main vivaah kaa vichaar bhi nahin aayaa or samast jivan unhone presidency kalege ke ek nammaatr ke furniture vaale kamare main kaat diya
 While working in the Presidency College, he got to read the book "the Greek Alchemy" by the then great French chemist Barthelo
 turant unhone barthelo ko patr likhaa ki bharat main bhi ati prachinkaal se rasayan kii parampara rahi he
 At Bartello's insistence, Acharya sent him a long introductory article about ancient Hindu chemistry based on Nagarjuna's book "rasendrasarasangraha"
 barthelat ne isaki ek atyant vidvattapurna samiksha "jarnal de saawant" main prakashit kii, jisamen acharya raay ke kaary kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii gai thi
 Encouraged by this, Acharya finally propounded his famous book "history of Hindu Chemistry" which became world famous and through which the entire world was amazed by the vast chemistry of ancient India
 swayan barthelat ne is par samiksha likhi jo "jarnal de saawant" ke 15 prishthon main prakashit hui
 During his second stay in England in 1912, the Chancellor of Durham University awarded him an honorary d

 Conferred the title rasayan ke kshetra main acharya ne 120 shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 He gained international fame with the first formation of compounds called mercurous nitrate and ammonium nitrite
 doctor raay ne apana anusandhan kaary paarad ke yogicon se prarambh kiya tathaa paarad nitrite naamak yogic, sansar main sarvapratham san 1896 main, aapane hi taiyaar kiya, jisase aapaki antararashtriya prasiddhi prarambh hui
 Later, with the help of this compound, you prepared 80 new compounds and solved many important and complex problems
 aapane ammonium, zinc, cadmium, calcium, stransium, varium, magnesium ityadi ke nitriton ke sambandh main bhi mahatvapurn gaveshanaayen kin tathaa amine nitriton ko vishuddh rup main taiyaar kar, unke bhautik or rasinic gunon kaa puraa vivaran diya
 You also studied the organometallic compounds in particular and found out many useful facts and prepared a new compound of mercury, sulfur and iodine, and showed that its crystals change color when kept in light and again when kept in darkness Returns the original color
 san 1904 main bengal sarkaar ne aapako europe kii vibhinn rasayanashalaon ke nirikshan ke liye bheja
 Foreign scholars and scientific institutions welcomed you on this occasion with respect

 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Rai was a born patriot
 unki aatmakatha main iske pramaan sthaan-sthaan par prakat hue hai
 While studying modern chemistry in Edinburgh, he used to worry about why India is not contributing in the field of science
 yahaan 1885 main unhone ek nibandh pratiyogita main bhaag liya jiskaa vishay tha- "bharat-gadar ke pehle or baad"
 He severely criticized the British Raj in his article
 pratiyogita ke pashchaat unhone yah lekh bharat ke mitra samajhe jane vaale british saansad jon brit ko bhej diya
 Bright praised the article very much
 baad main acharya ne ise ek laghu pustika ke rup main prakashit karvaa diya
 Even while giving lectures in the chemistry class to the students in the Presidency College, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Rai did not forget to say that "science can wait but Swaraj can not" ie science can wait but not Swaraj
 1892 main unhone is desh kii pratham rasinic udyog company "bengal chemicals and pharmaceuticals works" kii sthapana kii jo aaj bhi bengal chemicals ke naam se karyrat he
 He also loved Indian society
 1922 ke bengal ke bheeshan akaal main acharya raay apane sabhi kaaryon ko chhodkar peediton kii sahaayta ke liye nikal pade
 Through personal efforts, he collected aid amounting to three lakh rupees
 unke aahvaan par bengali lalanaon ne mahange reshmi vastra or aabhushan aadi sabhi kuch unki jholii main daal die
 Seeing his untiring efforts, someone had told the truth that if Mahatma Gandhi could produce two more luminous moons, India would have got Swaraj soon
 acharya raay ko maatrubhaasha se bhi atyadhik pyaar tha
 He supported the mother tongue as the medium for teaching all subjects including science
 ve jivan paryant bangala bhashaa or sahitya ke unnayan ke liye kaary karte rahe
 His articles were regularly published in Basumati and Bangbani
 is bangala prem ke kaaran janata ne unhen 1931-34 ke liye bangeey sahitya parishad ke adhyaksh pad par asin kiya
 He also instituted two awards for science students, 'nagarjuna Award' in chemistry and 'asutosh Mukherjee Award' in flora and zoology
 dow raay ko rasayan ke sivaay itihaas se bada prem tha
 As a result, after deep study for 10-12 years, he wrote an important book called History of Hindu Chemistry, which brought you great fame

 sikh dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Khalsa is a collective form of duly initiated followers of Sikhism
 khalsa panth kii sthapana guru gobind singh ji ne 1699 ko baisakhi vaale din anandpur sahib main kii
 On this day, he made five love amritpan by making Khalsa first and after that he also performed Amritpanan by the hands of those five loves
 satguru gobind singh ne khalsa mahima main khalsa ko "kaal purakh kii fuj" pad se niwaja he
 Sikhs and hair were already with the Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh fixed the "khande Bate ki Pahul" and also gave it Kacha, Kadha and comb
 isi din khalse ke naam ke peeche "singh" lag gaya
 Khalse's body began to be seen in physical appearance
 par khalse ne aatm gyaan nahin choda, us kaa prachaar chalata rahaa or aavashyaktaa padane par talwaar bhi chalati rahi
 The attacks of other religions and governmental Numindo over Sikhism had steadily increased
 sarkaar ko galat khabaren de kar islam ke kattar anuyaayiyon ne guru arjuna dev ji ko maut kii sajaa dilava di
 When Guru Arjun Dev was martyred with great grief, Guru Hargobind ji lifted the sword
 yah talwaar sirf aatm raksha or aam janata kii behatari ke liye uthaai thi
 In the life of Guru Hargobind ji, there were 4 consecutive attacks on him and there was also an attack on Satguru Hari Rai
 guru hari krishna ko bhi badshaah aurangzeb ne apana anuyaayi banane kii koshish kii
 The government killed Guru Tegh Bahadur, because he had gone to appeal to the government after seeing the sufferings of the Hindu Brahmins
 uske baad sarkari ahalakaaron ne gurmat ke badhate prachaar va anuyaayiyon kii baari sankhya ko apane dharm ke liye khatra samajhnaa shuru kar diya or wo iske viruddh ekajute ho gaye
 Meanwhile Guru Gobind Singh composed some banis which had strict comments against Islam
 uparokt paristhitayon tathaa aurangzeb or uske numaayindon ke gaiyr-muslim janata ke prati atyaachaari vyavhaar ko dekhte hue dharm kii raksha hetu jab guru gobind singh ne sashastr sangharsh kaa nirnay liya to unhone aise sikhon kii talash kii jo gurmat vichaardhaara ko aage badhaaen, dukhiyon kii madad karen or zaroorat padhne par apana balidaan dene main bhi peeche naa haten| When a religion progresses, it is very common to see that its followers are many, most of them are seen, some are in the shadows, some are due to their own self-will, the real followers are counted only as they are Huh
 is baat kaa pramaan anandpur main mila
 When Satgur Gobind Singh came out with a sword and said, "he needs a head"
 All of them were stunned
 Some slip away from the spot
 The Guru started going mad
 Some came to watch the spectacle
 Some mata ran to Gujri to see what Khumdi is cooking
 10 hazaar kii bheed main se pehla haath bhai dayaa singh ji kaa tha | gurmat vichaardhaara ke peeche voh sir katwane kii shamata rakhata tha | guru sahib usko tamboo main le gaye | vahaan ek bakre kii gardan kaati | khun tamboo se bahar nikalataa dikhaai diya | janata main dar or bad gaya | tab bhi himat dikhaa kar dharm singh, himmat singh, mohakam singh, sahib singh ne apana sis katwanaa sweekaar kiya | guru sahib bakre jhatakate rahe | The five then got out of the tent and made the pahul of khande bate
 khanda bata, jantra mantra or tantra ke smel se bana he
 It was first built by Satgur Gobind Singh
 is vidhi se hua tayar jal ko "pahul" kehete hai
 In common language, it is also called Amrit
 is ko pi kar sikh, khalsa fuj, kaa hisa ban jaataa he arthath ab usne tan man dhan sab parameshwar ko saunp diya he, ab wo sirf sach kaa prachaar karegaa or zarurat padhne par wo apana galaa kataane se peeche nahin hatega
 Will stay away from all vices
 aise sikh ko amritadhari bhi kaha jaataa he
 This Pahul was fed to all five and got them from the title of five loves
 2 kakkar to sikh dharm main pehle se hi the
 Where Sikhs understood spiritually even on all things, Satgur Gobind Singh ji separated the Khalsa in the physical look by giving them comb, kadha and kacha along with those two kakars
 aaj khande bate kii pahul paanch pyaare hi tayar karte hai
 This process has become a custom today
 aaj waisi pariksha nahin lee jaati jaisi us same lee gai thi
 This process is also called Amrit Sanchar
 itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki guru gobind singh ji bhi paanch pyaaron ke aadhin chalaa karte the or un ke hukum ko mana karte the
 The five loves ordered Gobind Singh to leave the fort of Chamkor and he had to obey
 paanch pyaaron ne phir gobind singh ji ko tokaa, jab gobind singh in kii parakh ke liye dadu kii kabr par namaskara kar rahe the
 Gobind Singh also sent Banda Bahadur with five loves, history mentions that when Banda Bahadur continued to violate the love, Banda Bahadur was all left in the fort
 gobind singh or khalsa fuj ne bahadur shah kii madad kii or use shaasha banane ke liye uske bhai se loha bhi liya
 It was Khalsa who discovered the bani of Guru Gobind Singh and molded it as a book

 charles darwin kii "origin ov spishiz" naamak pustak ke purv saadhaaran dharna yah thi ki sabhi jeevadhariyon ko kisi daivi shakti ne utpann kiya he tathaa unki sankhya, rup or akruti sadaa se hi nishchit rahi he
 But after the publication of the said book, developmentalism took the place of this notion and then like other animals, the question was generally asked for human beings as to when and which animal or animal group it developed
 is prashn kaa uttar bhi darwin ne apni duusari pustak "decent ov main" dwaara dene kii cheshtaa karte hue bataaya ki keval vanar hi manushya ke purvajon ke sameep aa sakate hai
 Unfortunately, people of religious instincts not only opposed Darwin's assertion of the above statement, but also popularized the idea of monkeys as the ancestors of humans, who still hold their place in the masses
 yadhyapi darwin manushya vikaas ke prashn kaa samaadhaan na kar sake, tathaapi inhone do gudh tathyon kii ore pranivigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya : Only human beings can be related to human ancestors and maanavaakar kapiyon tathaa manushya ke vikaas ke bich main ek badi khain he, jise lupt jeevashmon kii khoj kar ke hi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 It is plausible that in Darwin's time, despite not having a single human fossil available, he predicted the presence of such remains hidden in the geology that proved to be true

 Absorption of carbon_14 ceases after death and the present carbon_14 again changes to nitrogen_14 and returns to the atmosphere
 yah maaloom kiya ja chukaa he ki carbon_14 kaa aadha bhaag 5,720 varshon main nitrogen_14 main badal paata he
 Therefore, by finding the amount of carbon present in the fossil, knowledge of the age of a fossil can be obtained

 yadhyapi uparyukt donon jeevashm, keval jabadon ke rup main hi hone ke kaaran maanav vikaas par adhik prakaash nahin daalate, phir bhi unase nimnlikhit do baton kaa bodh avashya hota he : Human beings were present in the ancient times like Alphanayuga and maanavaakar copi kaa vikaas tarsier jaise primet se bina vanar kii avasthaa main gujarey hi hua he
 Monkeys are considered primitive from human beings, so the absence of monkey status in the human development chain seems averse to hope; But the above mentioned fossils, despite being very primitive, do not present any symptoms of apes, but they have the qualities of human plants
 dryopithicas --dryopithicas ke madhyanutan yugin jeevashm pracheen sansar ke kai bhaagon main praapt hue hai
 a replica of its crescent surface is also found in gibbons, large cups, and humans, leading to speculation that Dryopithicus was probably the common ancestor of all human plants, including humans
 limnopithicas --purvi africa ke madhyanutan yugin staron main paaya gaya jeevashm vartmaan gibbon se kaaphi miltaa julata he
 Like the gibbons, its radicular teeth were long and the arms, although relatively small, were still tall in proportion to the apes
 atev inhen vanar or maanavaakar copi ke bich kaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Proconsal - Proconsal fossils were obtained from the levels of the early Middle Ages in Kenya
 inkaa mukh vaanron kaa sa, parantu danta pratikruti maanavaakar kapiyon jaisi thi
 There is a feeling that they will be able to walk through the night
 sambhavat: ye vanamaanush or gorilla ke purvaj rahe honge
 In the medieval era, only Dryopithicus can be said to be in the direction of human development, because its teeth have a pattern of teeth, although not in the present man, but they are found in the ancestors of the present man
 is satya main yadi tanik sanshay rah jaataa he, to vah yah ki dryopithicas ke radanak manushya se kahin adhik lambey hai or manushya or manushya ke purvaj main itane lambey radanak sambhav nahin jaan padate
 The truth is that all the fossils found in the levels of the Middle Ages are long, pointed and protruding, which is not a symptom of human development
 oriopithicas --oriopithicas kaa jeevashm italy main taskani kii koyale kii khaanon ke atinutanyugin staron se praapt kiya gaya
 Its small mouth, diminishing radon and jaw shape was far from apes and close to human cups
 apane daanton kii banaavat main yah swayan manushya ke samaan tha
 Although its buttocks were similar to those of apes, the design of the front vertebrae of the spinal cord indicates its standing
 atev yadi uparyukt anumaan sahi he, to hamen oriopithicas main nutan-jeev-mahakalp ke praarambhik maanav kaa pratham darshan miltaa he
 Astralopithicus - In 1924, Raymond Dart received several skulls from a place called Tougs in southern Africa
 dart ne unhen australlopithicas kaa naam diya
 Australopithecus means the cup found in the south, so it has no relation with the country of Australia
 1936 idri main dakshini africa ke hi sterchfontine naamak sthaan se robert broom ne australlopithicas ke anya jeevashm atyantnutan yug ke staron se praapt kiye
 All fossils of primitive humans have been obtained from this era, hence it is called the era of human development
 australlopithicas kaa jeevashm is yug ke anya sabhi jeevashmon main adhik maanavaakar tha
 Even some of its characteristics resembled humans; For example, advance position on the skull spine, frontal spherical, non-bulging of eyebrow bones, protruding jaw, rodents smaller and less pointed, widening of bone called ileum of hip and many more
 The astralopithecus was so close to humans that it was natural to include it in the human family, the "hominidi"
 kapaalguha ke aaytan main avashya hi vah manushya se pichhadaa tha or vishad vichaar rakhanevaale is gun ko atyadhik mahatv dete hai, parantu jo bhi manushya kaa purvaj hoga, uski kapaal guha vartmaan manushya se avashya kam rahegi
 In Australia, it is important to note that the volume of his cranial cavity was lower than that of humans, more than the present human curatives
 phir bhi australlopithicas ke manushya ke purvaj hone main ek shankaa rah hi jaati he or vah he yug kii
 It is well known that the era in which there was Australopithecus, there were more developed humans present in it
 atev manushya kaa purvaj hone ke liye australlopithicas kii upasthiti or pehle honi chahie thi
 Homohabilis - Fossils of some developed human figure called Homohabilis were obtained from the Tanganyika location in East Africa
 iske aavishkarta the eldru esadru bidru like, pidru vidru tobias tathaa je aar nepier 
 The length of this human was 4 feet and hands more developed, which indicates his ability to build equipment and hut

 Pithicanthropus or the human surgeon of Java, Dadra Yugin Dubwa, believed since his student days that the birthplace of man was probably in Asia, in Java

 The fossil of this fossil was 900 cubic cm, which was more than that of Australopithecus and less than that of humans

 Cyananthropus, or human of China - Another human fossil was found in 1927 in the mid-tier, intermediate levels of a village called Choukutim, about 40 miles southwest of Peking in China, called Cyananthropus
 java or china ke maanvon kii atyadhik samaantaaon ke kaaran duusare ko pehle kii ek jati samajha jaataa he or bahudhaa use pithicanthopas pikinensis kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Kapalguha of this human was similar to human and many stone tools were obtained along with its fossils
 inase inamen udyogon ke prachlan kaa pataa chalata he
 The receipt of coal particles in the vicinity indicates their ignorance, and the presence of many long bones in the ripple condition indicates their human consumption
 hydalberg maanav --san 1907 main germany main hydalberg naamak sthaan main atyantnutan yug ke praarambhik staron se ek jabada praapt hua, jiske daant vartmaan manushya ke samaan the
 There was a lack of chin, so it is clear that it was not fully human
 swanskomb maanav --san 1935 or 36 main edri tidru marston ko england ke swanskalamb naamak sthaan main maanav kapaal kii bhittikasthi kii do haddiyaan praapt huin
 Although the thickness of these bones was greater than the man's wall, the volume of the Kapalguha was about 1,300 cubic centimeters
 guha ke saanche se yah bhi anumaan lagata he ki mastishk ke dharaatal kaa parivalan bhi bahut kuch manushya jaisaa hi tha
 Steinheim Man - In 1933, a complete skull was found in a place called Steinheim, Germany, whose period was similar to that of a swanscomb human
 rachana dwaara yah pithicanthropus or manushya ke bich kii kadi prathit hoti he
 Its volume of Kapalguha was 1,000 cubic centimeters, eyebrow bone occurred and jaws were very human like
 nianderthal maanav --san 1856 main johain karl fularote naamak sthaan main maanav jeevashm praapt hua, jise nianderthal maanav kaa naam diya gaya
 Later about 100 such fossils were found in other parts of the world

 It also had some properties which are not found by the present man, such as having a volume of 1,600 cubic centimeters of the volume of the cranial cavity and a very large alveolar dental cavity
 itnaa hi nahin uski nitambasthiyaan moti, tedi or bedaul thim, jisase iske ladkadaa kar chalane kaa bhaas hota he
 Therefore, on one hand, while it had many qualities of man, on the other hand there were many big differences
 atev, nienderthal maanav ko manushya vikaas kii mukhya shakha kii keval ek udbhrant upashakha hi maan sakate hai
 The absence of the remains of this human in the last ice age indicates that they were either destroyed on the arrival of humans, or merged into their family by hybridization
 saamaajik vyavastha main nienderthal maanav ab tak ke sab maanvon se aage the
 It was the practice of burying their dead and their tools were the highest

 All of these humans were Neanderthal human-like in most of their traits, although they were less than Neanderthal, ie human-like, in the volume of Kapalgaha
 uparyukt uplabdhiyon se yah pataa chalata he ki nienderthal maanav kaa vistaar vistrut tha
 Chromagnon was human
 Modern humans — Fossils of the closest ancestors of the present humans have been obtained from a place called Chromagnon in southern France
 inhen chromagnon maanav, athwa "aadhunik maanav", kaha jaataa he
 Their ashes not only indicate their being tall, shapely, strong and intelligent, but it is extremely difficult to separate them from the present European nations

 According to John Napier, co-inventor of Homohabilis, man's development has gone through five stages: praanrabhik purvamanav, kenyapithicas or ramapithicas ke jeevashmon dwaara janaa jaataa he
 These humans were probably in the earliest stages of human development
 baad ke purv maanav, kaa pratinidhitiv africa se praapt australlopithicas karata he, The earliest humans are known by Homohyabilis derived from Africa itself, uttarabhavi manushya, ke antargat homoiractus, athwa java or china ke maanav, aate hai or The first example of modern humans / Homo sapiens is found in chromagnon humans

 Perhaps their axial life may be one of the other reasons for brain growth

 These tools have been found with, or around, human fossils, and have also evolved along with human-brain development
 praarambhik aujaar bhonde or pathar ke tukade maatr the, parantu baad main ye sudrudh or upyogi hote gaye
 These tools are available only in very modern era, hence knowledge of their era is also applied to the glacial eons who have fallen in this era
 bhinn bhinn samay par paae gaye upkarnon ko ek udyog kaa naam dete hai
 The name is based on the name of a European place
 aujaar udyog ke aadhaar par atyantnutan yug ko teen kaalon main vibhakt kar sakate hai : Puraparastra period, Madhya Pradesh level and Navastra period
 puraprastar kaal ko chaar anya kaalon main vibhakt kar sakate hai Early period - The tools obtained at the beginning of the very modern era are in the form of coarse pieces of stones
 bahudhaa yah ndehmay jaan padataa he ki ye manushya dwaara hi gadhe gaye honge
 Lower period - The following industries have been found in this period: atinutan yug ke, sambhavat: maanav nirmit, ye prastar avshesh england ke kent pradesh main praapt hue the
 Middle period - The industry of this period is as follows: musterian udyog--yah udyog tritiy himandeey kalp se antim, arthath chaturth himandeey kalp, ke praarambhik kaal tak failaa tha
 In this industry, hand axes were replaced by other tools, which were made with great skill by removing huge chisels of stones
 yah udyog kaal niryederthal maanav kaal mana jaataa he
 Answer - This period is found in the last phase of the last glacial cycle
 iske antargat nimnlikhit udyog sanmilit hai : The period until the end of the last glacial cycle or the return of the hot climate is called the mid-life period
 yah alpakaaleen yug kaha jaataa he
 By this time man had become civilized

 Most of the animals found in winter were either destroyed or migrated during this period
 america main aanevaale pratham maanav isi yug ke the
 The stone tools were subtle and peculiar in shape
 yah antim or vartmaan yug he
 Although stone tools were also made in this era, agriculture and animal husbandry were special events of this era

 Possibly the civilization of this era originated in Egypt, Mesopotamia, North Western India and large rivers of these parts, such as the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates and the valleys of Sindh

 In modern animals, the group that can claim to be closely related to them is called primates
 yah staniyon kaa ek samooh he
 a brief description of primates becomes essential in the study of human development
 prakhyat jeevashm vigyaani, ji ji simpasan, ke anusaar priameties kaa vargeekaran is prakaar kar sakate hai : Tarsier - There is only one species of Tarsier, which is found in the islands of East Asia, but its fossils are also found in Europe and America, indicating their wide distribution
 limar - ye madagascar dweep par hi paae jate hai or vrikshavasi hote hai
 They often come to the ground in search of food
 ye sarvabhakshi hote hai
 Loris - They are found in tropical Africa and Asia
 chote or samoor-daar hone ke kaaran ye lokapriy, paaltu jantu maane jate hai
 Monkeys of the New World - Among these are the following castes: marmoset - marmoset ushnkaribandheey america main paaya jaataa he
 It is tree dweller and omnivorous
 seebus - ye ushnkaribandheey america main paae janevaale vrikshavasi vanar hai, jo maanavaakar kapiyon kii bhanti sadhano yaa karan kaa upyog karte hai
 Eloeta - Eloeta are found near the Panama Canal in Central America on an island called Barrow Collaredo
 ye vanar sansar main sabase adhik shor machaanevaale jantu hai
 Some social trends are also found in them
 pracheen sansar ke vanar - inamen neeche likhi jatiyaan hai : Baboons - Baboons live in Africa and southern Asia
 ye maap main bhediyein ke baraabar hote hai
 Their snout is long and short
 makaak--makaak kii vibhinn jatiyaan jibraltar, uttari africa, bharat, malaya, china or japan main pai jaati hai
 These are tree dwellers, clever and hardworking animals
 maanavaakar kapigan - maanavaakar copi ke antargat chaar brihat copi, gibbon, orang, utaan, gorilla or chimpanzi, aate hai
 Although many similarities are found between large humans and humans, it would be grossly flawed to call them ancestors of humans, because where there are similarities between humans and these lovers, there are some similarities between them and former apes
 itnaa hi nahin, brihat copi apane anek gunon main manushya se adhik vishisht hai
 Therefore, on the basis of similarities, we can only say that the elders and ancestors of man must have been one in ancient times
 ve vishesh gun, jinhone manushya ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya, nimnlikhit hai : Standing and walking - Although some people also often stand up, but by nature, standing man is the only person
 is gun ke falswaroop manushya ke haath anya kaaryon ke liye swatantra ho jate hai
 The structure and position of his bones changed in the position of internal organs for standing and walking
 pair kii asthiyon main mahatvapurn parivartan hue
 The thumb came in line with the other fingers and the legs arched and gained special ability to walk and run on the ground
 ye gun manushya kii suraksha or bhojan khojane kii kshamta main vishesh rup se sahaayak siddh hue
 Stereoscopic vision - The movement of the eyes on the face towards the front had started in the earlier apes like Tarsier, but it was fully developed in humans
 iske dwaara vah donon aankh ek hi vastupar kendrit kar na keval uskaa ek hi pratibimb dekh paata he, varan uske trivim aakaar kii vivechna bhi kar saktaa he
 Through this special vision, he is able to estimate only the distance and size of the object and he can see even more far
 sanmukh angushth --sanmukh angushth kaa arth he, angushth ko anya ungaliyon kii pratikul sthiti main laayaa ja sakna
 In this case, the thumb is able to come in front of other fingers and hold it together in objects
 yah gun jantu samooh main keval primet ganon main, vastuon kii pareekshan hetu mukh ke samukh laane se, prarambh hua tathaa manushya main uskaa itnaa adhik vikaas hua ki aaj manushya kaa haath ek atyant samvedansheel or sookshmagrahi yantra ban gaya he
 With the help of such a hand, man has been able to work his mental powers to become the most talented creature in the world
 yah kahana ki sanmukh angushth ne hi maanav mastishk ke sanvardhan main yogadan kiya he, atishyokti ne hogi
 In this way, the first change in the direction of development would have been made to stand upright on the first legs and to hold things well with the second hand
 haath main hue parivartan ne use upkaran banane kii ore protsaahit kiya hoga or upkarnon ne akraman kar shikaar karne, yaa apni suraksha karne, kii bhaavana usamen utpann kii hogi
 The achievement of the external means of attack would have resulted in the deterioration of its invading organs and characteristics in the hands themselves
 haath ke adhik kriyasheel hone par, mastishk sanvardhan swaabhaavik hi hua hoga
 In short, there would have been three main stages in human development: first the feet, the second the hands and the third the brain development
 saadharantaya maanav or vanar, visheshkar maanavaakar vanar, apni shaareerik rachanaaon main samaan hai : samaan asthiyaan, ang, mansapeshiyaan or yahan tak ki raktasamooh bhi
 But on microscopic examination many differences are also found, which are mainly due to man standing and walking on two legs
 udaahranarth, kapiyon ke pratikul manushya kii taange haathon se apekshaakrit lambii hona, kuulhe kii asthi ke aakaar or sthiti main parivartan, pairon ke anguuthon kaa anya ungliyon kii sidh main aana tathaa swayan pairon kaa chapakar ho janaa aadi
 Apart from these qualities, the brain of man is bigger than all other plants
 jahaan kapiyon kii kapaalguha kaa aaytan 350-450 ghan centimetre he, vahaan manushya kaa 1200-1500 ghan senmidru tak he
 His relatively flat face, jagged and chin-shaped jaw and direct nose give him a human form
 hothon ke aantarik bhaag kaa baahar dikhaai padana, kaanon kii bariyon kaa muda hona, baalo kaa sampurna sharir par na hona, radanak daant kaa hona, aise anya gun hai jo manushya ko kapiyon se dur le jate hai
 It is clear that the growth of the brain itself has been the force of the entire development of man
 yah vruddhi ab bhi ho rahi he yaa nahin, yah kahana kathin he, parantu jitna kuch vikaas ho chukaa he uske aadhaar par maanav or lupt sarisrupon ke vikaas se tulanaatmak nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai
 The body of the extinct reptiles had turned into a giant
 falswaroop brihat sharir kii aavashyaktaaon ko apekshaakrit chota mastishk puraa na kar sakaa or ye jantu kramash: lupt hote gaye
 In contrast to this, the brain has become much larger in proportion to the body in humans, so the majority of the brain's power remains even after meeting the physical requirements
 yah shakti manushya apane sukh sadhano ko ekatrit karne tathaa vigyaan or takneekee uplabdhiyon ko praapt karne main laga rahaa he
 They also contain the seeds of destruction
 manushya kaa bhavishya, arthath vah rahegaa athwa sarisripiyon kii bhanti prithvi rupi rangamanch par apana abhinay samaapt karke sadaa ke liye lupt ho jayega, yah uske vinaashkari aujaaron kii shakti or unke upyog par nirbhar karata he
 If it is omitted, it will fulfill the conclusion that there is a need for coordination in the body and brain development of an animal in nature
 aisa na hone par us jantu kaa bhavishya main astitv sadaa anishchit hi rahegaa
