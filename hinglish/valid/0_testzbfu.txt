 They dissolve heat, salt in water
 yadi praapt amla ko or adhik nirjalit karnaa ho, to usamen kuch phosphorus pentoxide daalkar hilaate hai or drav kaa pun: aswan kar lete hai
 The commercial method of making prussic acid is: Sulfuric acid is reacted on an aqueous solution of 23% sodium cyanide inside a generator with lead levels and condensates the vapors obtained by this action
 is kriya ke antargat amla kii maatra ko cynide kii maatra se adhik rakhaa jaataa he
 Partial distillation of the liquid thus obtained gives prusic acid of about 98% concentration
 isi prakaar sodium cynide ke sthaan par calcium cynide lekar bhi ise praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In Germany, a significant amount of this acid is also made from molasses obtained from the sugar beet industry
 in vidhiyon ke atirikt sanshleshan dwaara bhi prusik amla praapt kiya jaataa he
 There are two major methods for this
 pehali vidhi main kisi hydrocarbon tathaa ammonia ke mishran kaa niyantrit oxikaran kiya jaataa he
 a hot mixture of methane, ammonia and a small amount of oxygen, flows over the lattice of platinum-iridium
 nimnlikhit kriya ke falswaroop prusik amla praapt ho jaataa he : Other hydrocarbons may also be used in place of methane, but the reaction is much better than methane
 farmamide ke nirjaleekaran dwaara bhi prusik amla banaaya ja saktaa he
 The vaporized formamide was mixed with a large amount of ammonia and 360 ° c above the catalyst, aluminum phosphate
 Heating is carried on: uparyukt sameekaran rasinic kriya pradarshit karata he
 The pricic acid thus formed is absorbed in a sodium hydroxide solution, which is obtained as sodium cyanide

3v10-2 he, jo carbonic amla ke viyojan sthiraank kaa hi hota he
 Therefore, it is clear that it is very weak acid
 shuddh avasthaa main prusik amla sthaayee padaarth he, jise kaanch ke bartan main kaaphi din tak aparivartit avasthaa main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In the presence of some alkaline substances, such as ammonia or sodium cyanide, the polymerization of the acid begins, respectively, and as a result of this action, a dark substance is obtained which has almost the same chemical organization as prusic acid
 is kriya main paryaapt maatra main ooshmaa nikalati he
 Also, by applying heat, the velocity of the reaction also increases
 at: adhik maatra main is padaarth kaa bahulkikaran hone se taap kii vruddhi ke saath saath visphot ho jane kii bhi kaaphi sambhaavna rahati he
 This acid can be made permanent in the presence of acid or water-producing substances
 is amla ke astor saadhaaran vidhi se nahin banaae ja sakate
 For this, the action of sodium or potassium cyanide on alkyl halide or sulfate is required: iske atirikt alkil cynide, amlon ke amidon ke anadrikaran se bhi banaae ja sakate hai, jisase spasht he ki yah yogic saamaanya cynide mu-kaa naa hai tathaa inako un amlon kaa nitril bhi kehete hai, kyonki inke jayeepghatan se ve amla praapt ho jate hai: Prusic acid reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form additive substances and these compounds have special importance in the synthesis of hydroxy acids
 prusik amla ethilin oxide se ethilin sainahyderin banaata he, jo kuch utprerakon kii upasthiti main asut kiye jane par jal kaa ek anu nikaalkar ek yogic acrilo nitril banaata he
 This compound has special significance in synthesized rubber, fiber and other industries
 at: uparyukt kriya is yogic ke vyapaarik nirmaan main kaam aati he
 The action of prussic acid with chlorine produces cyanogen chloride and similarly cyanogen bromide with bromine, which are of great use
 amlon kii upasthiti main prusik amla jal ke 1 yaa 2 anu lekar farmamide yaa ammonia formet banaata he
 And its water decomposition produces ferric acid
 iske hydrogenikaran yaa apchayan se methil emin banataa he
 In most reactions, cyanide radical behaves like a non-associative non-metallic element
 jis prakaar dhaatuon ke hellide hote hai, usee prakaar dhaatuon ke cynide bhi hote hai
 This similarity is more pronounced in cyanides of alkaline metals, such as sodium or potassium cyanide
 iske atirikt cynojan mulak jatil yogic bhi banaata he, jaise potacium pherocynide, 
 The metals of the eighth class and in the transition metal have great potential to form complex cyanides
 vyavsaayon main prayukt honevaale prusik amla ke lavenon main sodium cynide pramukh he
 In pure state it is obtained by the reaction of castor sodium on ammonia and coal by the method of castor
 ise, prusik amla ko sodium hydroxide vilyan main avashoshit karke bhi banaaya ja saktaa he, par is prakaar praapt sodium cynide kam shuddh hota he
 The salt obtained is soluble in water, alcohol and non ammonia and its melting point is 563
7 ° C
 is
 jaleey vilyan main yah apaghatit ho jaataa he, jiske falswaroop prusik amla tathaa sodium hydroxide praapt hote hai: Sodium decomposition and ammonia are obtained by water decomposition after heating an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide
 isi prakaar potacium cynide bhi praapt ho saktaa he
 Both these salts of prussic acid have special importance in the activities of organic chemistry
 is lavan kaa vyavsaayik mahatv, calcium cynide dwaara ise nirmaan ke kaaran bahut bad gaya he
 In pure state, it is in the form of white powder and it is used a lot as a smoker
 kuch anya dhatvik cynide, jaise kupramacynide, silvercynide tathaa jiksynide anek vyavsaayon tathaa rasinic kriyaaon main kaam aate hai
 Potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferrocyanide are hybrid salts of prussic acid, which are of great importance in chemical analysis, in the Prussian indigo, in the dyeing industries, and in pigments called iron cyanide indigo
 prusik amla tathaa iske lavan, jaise potacium cynide, bahut vifaille padaarth hai tathaa bahut hi kam maatra main bhi ghaatak siddh hote hai, jo koshikeey oxikaran kriya ke avarodhan ke kaaran hota he
 Symptoms of this toxin are senile, nausea, stuttering, unconsciousness and finally death

 yadi rogi ko kuch hosh ho to use ek prati shat sodium thayosulphate yaa sabun kaa jal mukh dwaara prati 15 minute main dena chahie, jab tak ki vaman na hone lage
 The unconscious patient should not give anything out of the mouth
 yah vish itnaa teevr hota he ki koi virala hi batch paata he or mrityu bahut jald ho jaati he
 The importance of prusic acid for the control of common insects and perishable insects was first known in California in 1886 as a deciduous antidote in orange trees
 godaamon, jahaajon, relon aadi main jahaan saamaan ikattha rahata he, iskaa upyog dhoomak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Prusic acid is stored in iron cylinders for this purpose
 iske atirikt anya roopon main bhi iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Calcium cyanide is used as a dehydrating antidote, which gives vapor of prussic acid by the moisture of the air
 chuuhe, bijju aadi ke maarane main bhi calcium cynide kaa prayeg karte hai
 Nests of ants, termites etc
 can be destroyed by fumigation by calcium cyanide

 In Jainagam, only five Parmeshtis are considered adorable as Arihant, Siddha, Acharya, Upadhyaya and Sage
 inke aadya aksharon ko paraspar milaane par ‘om’ / ‘on’ ban jaataa he
 As such, the first letter of the first of these, 'arihant' or 'arhant' is taken as 'A'
 dwitiya parameshthi ‘siddh’ he, jo sharir rahit hone se ‘ashariri’ kehalaate hai
 Hence, a + a = 'A' becomes after mixing the first letter 'A' of 'ashari' with 'A' of Arihant
 usamen tritiy parameshthi ‘acharya’ kaa pratham akshar ‘aa’ milaane par aa+aa milakar ‘aa’ hi shesh rahata he
 In it, the first letter of the fourth Parameshthi 'upadhyaya', when combined with 'U', becomes 'O' by joining a + U
 antim paanchaven parameshthi ‘sadhu’ ko jainagam main muni bhi kaha jaataa he
 Therefore, when the initial letter 'M' of the sage is combined with 'O', o + m = 'om' or 'on' becomes
 ‘jain’ shabd main ‘ja’, ‘na’ tathaa ‘ja’ ke upar ‘i’ sambandhi do matraayen bani hoti hai
 Only through these can the mark of Jain traditional 's' be made

 In fact, in ancient script, it was made 'O' by drawing a shape similar to 'ref' above 'U'
 or uske saath chandrabindu prayukt hone se vah -‘om’ / ‘on’ ban jaataa tha
 But due to lack of tradition of reading or writing handwritten texts, printing work has started in printing press
 ham logon kii asaavadhaanee athwa agyanta ke kaaran priting press main yah parivartit hokar anya parampara maanya banaaya jane laga
 As a result of this, we have often forgotten the mark recognized by the Jain tradition and have confessed 7 to the Jain tradition with illusion

 In this regard, revered Acharyadev, Sadhus, Sadhivis, scholars, preachers, who were influential of Jainism, at the time of his sermon, also knew about this 'om' from the Jain tradition and the practical method of making it, by informing the general public about the real nature of the Lord's rule

 Shabbir Ahluwalia is an Indian actor
 baiju baavaraa bharat ke dhrupadagayak the
 He is also known as Baijnath Prasad and Baijnath Mishra
 ve gwalior ke raja maansingh ke darbar ke gayak the or akbar ke darbar ke mahaan gayak tansen ke samakaleen the
 There are many legends about his life that cannot be historically confirmed
 16 veen shatabdi ke mahaan gayak sangitajna tansen ke gurubhai pandit baijnath kaa janm chanderi main san 1542 main sharad poornima kii raat ek brahman parivaar main hua
 Pandit Baijnath had a lot of interest in singing and music since childhood
 unke gale kii madhurata or gayan kii chaturaai prabhaavshaalee thi
 In childhood, people used to call Pandit Baijnath as 'baiju'
 baiju kii umr ke saath-saath unke gayan or sangeet main bhi badhotaree hoti gai
 When Baiju was young, he fell in love with a young woman named Kalavati of the city
 kalavati baiju kii preyasi ke saath-saath preranarot bhi rahi
 Baiju fell madly in love with his beloved, along with music and singing
 isi se log unhen baiju baavaraa kehane lage
 Baijnath received the initiation of singing in Dhrupad style from the then famous Guru Haridas Swami in Vrindavan
 gwalior main jai vilaas mahal main sangrakshit aitihaasik pustakon ke anusaar, baiju raag deepak gaakar tel ke deep jala sakate the, raag megh, megh malhaar, yaa goud malhaar gaakar varsha kara sakate the, raag bahaar gaakar phool khilaa sakate the or yahan tak ki raag malkauns gaakar pathar bhi pighla sakate the
 Emperor Akbar was a lover of music and art
 uske darbar main sangeetkaaron or sahityakaron kaa tantaa laga rahata tha
 Tansen was counted among the nine gems of Akbar's court
 akbar ne apane darbar main ek sangeet pratiyogita kaa aayojan rakhaa
 The condition of this competition was that whoever wins against Tansen, he will be made the musician of Akbar's court and the loser contestant will be given death sentence
 koi bhi sangeetkaar is shart ke kaaran saamne nahin aayaa parantu baiju baavaraa ne yah bidaa uthaaya tathaa apane guru haridas se ajna praapt kar sangeet pratiyogita main bhaag liya
 Baiju eventually lost in this competition, but Akbar later delighted and proposed to keep Baiju in his court
 lekin akbar ke darbar ke itihaaskaar abul fazal or aurangzeb ke darbar ke itihaaskaar faqirullah ke anusaar baiju ne tansen ko pratiyogita main haraaya tha or tansen ne baiju ke pair chhukar apane praanon kii bheekh maangi thi
 Baiju forgave Tansen and went back to Gwalior himself
 baiju baavaraa akbar ke darbar main rahane ke bajaay gwalior aa gaye, jahaan unhen soochna mili ki unke guru haridas samadhisth hone vaale hai
 He reached Vrindavan for the last darshan of his Guru and after visiting him, faced various disasters and reached the last stop of his life at Srinagar, the capital of the King of Kashmir
 us samay unka shishy gopal nayak vahaan darbari gayak tha
 Fatehal Baiju asked the gatekeeper to convey the information of his arrival to Gopaldas, then the gatekeeper replied bluntly that his master had no master
 yah sunakar baiju ko kaafii aghat pahunchaa or ve srinagar ke ek mandir main pahunchakar raag dhrupad kaa gayan karne lage
 Hearing Baiju's excellent singing, a large crowd started to thrive
 jab baiju kii khabar kashmir naresh ke paas pahunchi, to ve swayan bhi vahaan aae tathaa baiju kaa swaagat kar apane darbar main le aae
 The King of Kashmir requested Baiju to re-impart music education to Gopaldas
 raja kii ajna se unhone gopal ko punah sangeet shiksha dekar nipun kiya
 According to another legend, Gopal was the beloved disciple of the hero Baiju
 vah apni patni prabhaa ke saath baiju ko chhod jeevika ke liye kahin or chalaa gaya jiske aghat se baiju apana aapa kho baitha or uskaa naam baiju baavaraa pad gaya
 Gopal Nayak was appointed a singer in the court of the King of Kashmir and there he made it popular that he was self-educated and was not blessed by any guru
 yah sun baiju fatehaal srinagar pahunchaa or apane gayan se sabko mantrmugdh kar diya lekin gopal nayak ne apane guru ko pahchaanane se manaa kar diya
 Ahat Baiju went to a temple and started singing and there was a huge crowd and when the King of Kashmir came to know about this, the King of Kashmir sent Baiju to his court and got Baiju and Gopal to have a music competition
 baiju ko pehle gane kaa mauka mila or gopal ko uskaa uttar dena tha
 Baiju sang the raga Bhimpalasi due to which the stones started melting
 gopal ne uttar main gaaya lekin jeet na paaya
 As per the condition of the competition, the loser was to be given death penalty but Baiju Bawra requested the king to save Gopal from death penalty
 lekin apni morrkhtaa ke kaaran gopal ko apni jaan se haath ganvaana padaa
 His last miracle was done by his daughter Meera on the banks of Sutlej
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki dah sanskaar ke baad jab gopal kii haddiyon ko nadi main phenkaa gaya to vah dub gayin
 According to the legend, when Gopal's widow Prabha requested Baiju to bring those bones, Baiju taught Gopal's daughter Meera a new version of Raga Malhar, which she learned after a week when Meera in front of the crowd on the banks of the Sutlej When he sang, Gopal's bones started coming along the river
 us samay ke baad se us raag ko mira kii malhaar kaa naam diya gaya
 After this episode, the sad Baiju returned to Chanderi
 baiju kaa 71 varsh kii aayu main miyadi bukaar ke kaaran chanderi main san 1613 i
 main vasant panchami ke din dehant ho gaya
 It was an ancient city situated on the banks of the Godavari river in Maharashtra, it was the center of the commercial gait schools, seven vehicles made it their capital, in the records it is called Paithan
 paramdanav tara ek atyaadhik dravyaman or chamak vaala tara hota he jis se lagaataar gas, plasma or anya dravya badi matraaon main antariksh main uchhalte rahete hai

28 nanometer ke tarang dairghy par Hα naam kii ek lakeer shaamil hoti he jo hydrogen gas kii ek vishesh uttejnaa se paidaa hoti he
 Therefore, scientists test their luminosity and Hα presence to identify the demigods
 paramdanvon main suraj se 100-265 guna dravyaman hota he, yani 100-265 M☉ kaa dravyaman hota he
 Their brightness is millions of millions more than the brightness of the sun
 alag-alag paramdanvon kaa satahi taapmaana ek dusre se bahut bhinn hota he or 3,500 calvin se lekar 35,000 calvin tak ho saktaa he
 Paramdanavas are intrinsically temporary so their brightness varies with time
 itnaa adhik dravyaman hone se unki umr bhi kam hoti he - jahaan hamaare suraj ko 10 arab saal kii aayu mili he vahaan mahadaanav taare kuch dasiyon lakh saal hi jite hai
 Due to such a young age, very few stars are found very rarely

 Sanyogita / ˈsəmjoʊɡɪtɑː xɔːhɑːnə / ) was the wife of Prithvirajatriya
 prithviraj ke saath gandharvavivaah kar ke wein prithviraj kii ardhangini bani thi
 Incidentalism is counted among the important events in the history of India
 prithviraj kii teraa rajnion main se sanyogita ati rupavati thi
 Sanyogita was also known by the names Tilottama, Kantimati, Sanjukta, etc
 unke pita kannauj ke raja jayachand the
 Who assisted Ghori in the war against Prithviraj
 sanyogita kaa janm kannauj pradesh main hua tha
 His father's name was Jayachand
 prithvirajraso kavy ke sanyogitaswayamvar naam ke vibhaag main ullikhit he ki, sanyogita purv janm main rambha naamak apsara thi
 Due to the curse of a sage, she appeared on the earth in the name of Sanyogita
 sanyogita kaa ullekh vivedh kaavyon main bhinn rup main prapya he
 Such as Prithvirajaraso in poetry, Samyukrita, Prithvirajavijaya epic in Tilottama and Surjancharitmahakaavya in Kantimati prithvirajraso kavy main or surajncharit mahakavy main spashtollekh he ki, sanyogita jayachand kii putree thi
 The great part of Prithvirajvijay's epic is Kshatiyukta
 parantu vahaan bhi ganga nadi ke tat par viksit kisi gram main sanyogita kaa janm hua tha ye ullekha prapya he
 Historians believe that Kannauj was definitely that city
 sanyogita jab yauvan ko praapt hui, us samay sampoorn bharat main prithviraj kii veerta kii charchaayen ho rahi thi
 When Sanyogita heard the story of Prithviraj's valor, she got tied up in Prithviraj's love loop
 premshastra main asi kanyaon ko mugdha kaha gaya he
 When Jaichand came to know about the heartfelt love of Mugdha Sanyogita, he set out to marry his daughter with another king
 kyonki jayachand or prithviraj ke madhya sambandh vaimnasypurna the
 After that Jayachand conducted Ashwamedhayagya
 us yajna ke ant main sanyogita ke swayamvar kii bhi ghoshnaa kar di
 On the occasion of Swayamvar, he invited all the kings of the whole of India but did not invite Prithviraj
 prithviraj kii is prakaar apmaan karne par bhi jayachand santusht nahin hua
 Therefore, he made an idol of Prithviraj with iron and installed it in place of the gatekeeper
 parantu swayamvar ke samay sanyogita ne prithviraj kii murti ko hi varmala pahanaai
 When Sanyogita at the gate was wearing the statue of Prithviraj at the same time, Prithviraj entered the kingdom
 prithviraj ne sanyogita ko ashv ke upar bithaaya or dehali chale gayi
 Once, King Prithviraj was in the garden of Ajmeru's palace, at the same time Pratihari was present there
 pratihaari ne raja ko kaha, "he rajan ! kanyakubj se ai ek mahila aap se milanaa chaahati hai"
 After this, Pratihari presented the woman in front of the king after getting the king's signal
 raja ko pranaam kar mahila boli, "he rajan ! kanyakubj ke swami jayachand kii sanyogita namika kanya he
 How can i describe her beauty? Brahma has composed Kamadeva as the siddhi from the essence of all the verses
 sanyogita ke rachana ke samay brahm dwaara jo vastuen ekatrit kii gai, un vastuon se hi amrit, chandramaa, kumud or camel rachana hui"
 Pausing a little, the woman further said, "O Hindusharestha! If Kamadeva chants in an Amritasamudra, then Lakshmi: i can hardly compare the beauty of coincidence with those beautiful Lakshmi"
 ek baar apane pita ke saath rajmahal main sthit sanyogita ne aksmaat hi chaarnon dwaara gaaya hua aapkaa gunpratipadak geet suna
 When you defeated Mlechraja in the war, only then was there a feeling of affection towards you
 sanyogita kaa swarnakmal pushp jaise dedeepyaman mukh aapke virah se moorchhit camel pushpawat ho gaya
 Janou Kafoni, Kapokalan in Karakamal, looking at the nose and setting you in mind, she is spending the day
 ek din ratri ke tritiy prahar main swapn main sanyogita ne kaamdeorupi aap ke darshan kiye
 His antagonism has crossed the limits
 he rajan ! aaj vidhaataa bhi us par kashton kii varsha kar rahaa he
 Sanyogita's father is keen to get Sanyogita married with Anuraja by becoming his enemy
 pita kii ichha ko sun kar duhkhaveg se roti hui rajkumaari sanyogita ne apni sakhi ko kaha, "aho ! pruthivi par sthit ho kar chandramaa ko praapt karne kii ipsa morrkhtaa hi he
 The man i do not know, the man's actions are funny and funny
 vishesh ye he ki vah purush mahan samrat he
 The marriage proposal made by Kanya creates an irony
 atah he sakhi ! mere dushprapya manorath par aashaa ke ankur kii kalpana bhi nahin he" aisa bol kar sanyogita moorchhit ho gai
 After that, conscious effort, she said, "you go to Shakambhari
" meri hridayasthiti ko samrat ke sammukh upasthaapit karo
 If they don't come for my salvation, then i will drown in the Ganges "
 paricharika kaa nivedan sun kar samrat ne pratyuttar diya ki, "us mriganayani kaa manorath purna hua hi samajho
 Tell him that i will soon come to Kanyakubj to protect him "
 uske pashchaat paricharika kaa yogya aatithy karke use waapas bhej diya
 Immediately he himself walked towards Kanyakubj with his nobles
 prithviraj ne jab kanyakubj pravesh kiya, tab vah chhadmaveshi the
 Because he wanted to see every genre of Kanyakubja
 atah prithviraj chaaran ke vesh main nagar main yahan vahaan bhraman karne lage
 Prithviraj saw the gates of the city of Kanyakubja, the palace, the huge buildings, the quadrangle and the gardens
 evam kanyakubj nagar main bhraman karte hue unhone nagar ke vishay main suchnaayen ekatra kar lee
 According to the Surajncharit epic, Prithviraj went to Indrapastha, taking the coincidence in the night
 anya granthon main sanyogitaaharan kaa jo ullekh miltaa he, us se yah kinchit bhinn ullekh surjancharit mahakavy main praapt hota he
 Some scholars are of the opinion that, "there is no mention of coincidence anywhere in Jayachand's inscriptions
" evam uske astitv ke bhi koi pramaan na hone se vah ek kaalpanik paatr maani jaati hai"
 Among scholars who question the subject of being a historical character of Sanyogita, Dr
 Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha is counted
 dow ojha kaa mat he ki, jayachand ke shilalekhon main yaa tamrapatron main kahin bhi sanyogita kaa varnan nahin he or rambhamanjarimahakavy main or hammirmahakavy main sanyogita kaa ullekh praapt nahin hota he
 Therefore, it was the imagination of any bhat of the sixteenth century which is a character of coincidence
 anya itihasvidon kaa kathan he ki, rambhamanjarimahakavy main or hammirmahakavy main sanyogita kaa varnan nahin he ojha-mahoday ne kaha
 But there is no mention of Prithviraj's marriages in those texts
 jisase prithviraj ke vivaah nahin hue the ye kah nahin sakate

 bhautikee main, urja vastuon kaa ek gun he, jo anya vastuon ko sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he yaa vibhinn roopon main roopantarit kiya ja saktaa hai
 The ability of any worker to work is called energy
 oonchaai se girte hue jal main urja he kyonki usase ek pahiye ko ghumaya ja saktaa he jisase bijli paidaa kii ja sakati he
 It is difficult to give a simple definition of energy
 urja vastu nahin he
 We cannot see it, it does not surround any place, nor does it have any shadow
 sankshep main, anya vastuon kii bhanti yah dravya nahin he, yadyapi bahudhaa dravya se iskaa ghanishtha sambandh rahata he
 Yet its existence is as real as that of any other object and because in a mass community, which does not have the influence of any external force, its quantity is not deficient
 saadhaarant: kaary kar sakane kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 When a hunter with a bow pulls the strings, the bow brings energy which is used to drive the arrow to the hunt
 behate pani main urja hoti he jiskaa upyog panchakki chalaane main athwa kisi duusare kaam ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, gunpowder has energy, which can be used to break stone rocks or fire with cannon
 bijli kii dhara main urja hoti he jisase bijli kii motor chalaai ja sakati he
 Sunlight has energy that can be used to generate electric current by light cells
 aise hi anubam main nabhikeey urja rahati he jiskaa upyog shatru kaa vidhwans karne athwa anya kaaryon main kiya jaataa he
 Thus we see that energy is found in many forms
 tane hue spring main jo urja he use sthitij urja kehete hai; behate pani kii urja gatij urja he; barood kii urja rasinic urja he; bijli kii dhara kii urja vaidyut urja he; surya ke prakaash kii urja ko prakaash urja kehete hai
 The energy in the sun is due to its high temperature
 isko ushma urja kehete hai
 Energy can be converted from one form to another by various measures
 in parivartanon main urja kii maatra sarvada ek hi rahati he
 There is no lack in it
 ise urja-avinashita-siddhant kehete hai
 It is said above that the ability to work is called energy
 parantu sari urja ko kaary main parinat karnaa sarvada sambhav nahin hota
 Therefore it would be more appropriate to say that energy is an object that decreases as much as work
 is kaaran urja ko naapane ke ve hi ekak hote hai
 To measure the work
 yadi ham ek kilogram bhaar ko ek meter unchaa uthaate hai to prithvi ke gurutvkarshan ke viruddh ek vishesh maatra main kaary karnaa padataa he
 If we lift the same weight two meters high or lift two kilograms one meter high, then in both cases double work will have to be done as before
 isse prakat hota he ki kaary kaa pariman us bal ke pariman par, jiske viruddh kaary kiya jaae or us duuri ke pariman par, jis duuri dwaara us bal ke viruddh kaary kiya jaae, nirbhar rahata he or in donon parimaanon ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 We can consider any quantity of work as a unit of work
 udhaahrant: ek kilogram bhaar ko prithvi ke aakarshan ke viruddh ek meter unchaa uthaane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use ekak mana ja saktaa he
 But the attraction of the earth is not the same everywhere
 iskaa jo maan chennai main he vah dilli main nahin he
 Therefore, this unit is inconclusive
 phir bhi bahut se deshon main ejeeniyar aise hi ekak kaa upyog karte hai
 Which is called foot-pound
 yah us kaary kii maatra he jo landan ke akshansh main samudratat par ek pound ko ek duusare hi ekak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo centimetre-gram-senkad ke upar nirbhar he
 In this, the unit of force is called "dine"
 dine bal kaa vah ekak he jo ek gram ke pind main ek second main ek centimetre prati second kaa veg utpann kar saktaa he
 The point of action of this force is one cent against it
 m The amount of work that is required to be removed is called a square
 parantu vyaavhaarik drushti se kaary kaa yah ekak bahut chota he
 Therefore, a second unit is used in daily practice
 isamen lambaai kaa ekak centimetre ke sthaan par meter he tathaa dravyaman kaa ekak gram ke sthaan par kilogram he
 The unit of force in it is "newton"
 newton bal kaa vah ekak he jo ek kilogram ke pind main ek second main ek meter prati second kaa veg utpann kar saktaa he
 In this way, Newton equals 1 xxrep 5 0 dines
 is bal ke kriyabindu ko uske viruddh ek meter tak hataane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use jul kehete hai
 One joule equals 107 argo
 urja ko bhi inhen ekakon main napa jaataa he
 But sometimes some other units are used at special sites
 inamen ek electron volt he
 It is the unit of energy that an electron receives when it passes through the voltage difference
 yah bahut chota ekak he or keval 1
60 x 10 -19 jul ke baraabar hota he
 Additionally, a second unit is used to measure the electrical energy used in homes, called kilowatt-hours and which is equal to 3
6x 10 6 joules
 The unit of energy is the energy fields of Zon Percott Joule
 i kept 'joule' in memory of bringing a revolution
 un vastuon kii apeksha, jinke astitv kaa anumaan ham keval tark ke aadhaar par kar sakate hai, hamen un vastuon kaa gyaan adhik sugamawa se hota he jinhen ham sthool rup se dekh sakate hai
 The feeling of that form of energy first emerged in the brain of man, which is related to the big bodies and which can be seen clearly when it is turned into a work with the help of instruments
 is yantric urja ke do rup hai : ek sthitij urja evam doosraa gatij urja
 On the contrary, knowledge of the energy which is related to the movement of atoms and atoms occurred to humans later
 is kaaran yah kam aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki newton se bhi pehle francis bekan kii yah dharna thi ki ushma dravya ke kanon kii gati ke kaaran he
 The work we have to do to lift a body of one kilogram weight against the attraction of the earth one meter high, we can say kilogram-meter and it is equal to about 981 joules
 yadi ham ek door lekar ore use ek ghirani ke upar daalkar uske donon siron se lagbhag ek kilogram ke pind baandhe or unhen aisi avasthaa main choden ki ve donon ek hi oonchaai par na hon or unche pind ko bahut dhire-se neeche aane den to ham dekhenge ki ek kilogram ke pind ko ek meter unchaa uthaa degaa
 The lower the friction in the pulley, the second body can be kept equal to the weight of the first body
 isak arth yah hua ki yadi ham kisi pind ko prithvi se unchaa bad jaati he
 If a body of one kilogram is raised to 5 meters high, it has the capacity to work 5 kilogram-meters, and its energy increases to the same magnitude as before
 yah urja prithvi tathaa pind kii aapekshik sthiti ke kaaran hoti he or vastut: prithvi evam pind dwaara bane tantra kii urja hoti he
 That is why it is called potential energy
 jab kabhi bhi pindon ke kisi samudaay kii parsparik duuri athwa ek hi pind ke vibhinn bhaagon kii swaabhaavik sthiti main antar utpann hota he to sthitij urja main bhi antar aa jaataa he
 Pressing the segmental or bowing the bow brings potential energy to them
 nadiyon main band baandhakar pani ko adhik oonchaai par ikattha kiya jaae to is pani main sthitij urja aa jaati he
 Newton defined the force as the force equal to the rate of change of momentum
 yadi m kilogram kaa koi pind prarambh main sthir ho or usapar ek niyat bal F, t senkad tak kaary karke jo veg utpann kare uskaa maan v meter prati second ho to bal kaa maan m v t { \ displaystyle { \ frac {mv}{t}}} newton hoga
 At the same time, if the distance the body moves is d m, then the work done by the force will be equal to Fd joules
 arthath m dravyamanvaalen pind kaa veg yadi v ho to uski urja 1 2 m v 2 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}} hogi
 This energy is due to its motion in that body and is called kinetic energy
 jab ham dhanush ko jhukaakar tir chhodte hai to dhanush kii sthitij urja tir kii gatij urja me parivartan ho jaati he
 The most beautiful example of the reciprocal transformation of potential energy and kinetic energy is simple pendulum
 jab ham lolak ke golak ko ek ore khinchate hai to golak apni saadhaaran sthiti se thodaa unchaa uth jaataa he or isamen sthitij urja aa jaati he
 When we release the ball, the ball starts swinging here and there
 jab golak latakane kii saadhaaran sthiti main aata he to isamen keval gatij urja rahati he
 Due to momentum, the ball moves to the other side and the kinetic energy is again converted to potential energy
 saadhaarant: vaayu ke gharshan ke viruddh kaary karne se golak kii urja kam hoti jaati he or isaki gati kuch der main band ho jaati he
 If there is no force of friction then the pendulum will go on for eternity
 gati vigyaan main urja-avinashita-siddhant ke pramanit ho jane ke baad bhi iske duusare swaroopon kaa gyaan na hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa tha ki kai sthitiyon main urja nasht bhi ho sakati he; jaise, jab kisi pindsamudaay ke vibhinn bhaagon main apekshik gati ho to gharshan ke kaaran sthitij or gatij urja kam ho jaati he
 In fact, in such situations the energy is not destroyed, but the heat energy changes
 parantu 18veen shatabdi tak ushma ko urja kaa hi ek swatantra swaroop nahin samajha jaataa tha
 Till that time, there was a belief that heat is a substance
 19veen shatabdi main prayogon dwaara yah nirvivaad rup se siddh kar diya gaya ki ushma bhi urja kaa hi ek doosraa rup he
 Even in prehistoric times, humans used to produce fire by rubbing wood, but Benjamin Tamson first noticed the close connection of energy and heat
 yah sanyukt rajya ke maisachusets pradesh kaa rahanevaala tha
 But at that time it was the war minister of the King of Bavaria
 dhali hui pital kii top kii naliyon ko chhedate samay isane dekha ki nalee bahut garm ho jaati he tathaa usase nikle buraade or bhi garam ho jate hai
 In one experiment, by filling the water in the lumbar vessel around the canal cord, he saw that the heat generated by the lathe reached the temperature of boiling in two and a half hours
 is prayog main uskaa vaastavik dhyey yah siddh karnaa tha ki ushma koi drav nahin he jo pindon main hoti he or daab ke kaaran vaise hi baahar nikal aati he jaise nichodne se kapade main se pani; kyonki yadi aisa hota to kisi pind main yah drav ek simit maatra main hi hota, parantu chhednevaale prayog se gyaat hota he ki jitna hi adhik kaary kiya jaae utani hi adhik ushma utpann hogi
 Rumford did this experiment in 1798 AD
 iske 20 varsh pehle hi lavvajie tathaa laagranz ne yah dekha tha ki jaanwaron main bhojan se utani hi ushma utpann hoti he jitani rasinic kriya dwaara us bhojan se praapt ho sakati he
 In 1819, French scientist Duals observed that the compression of a gas produces heat in the same proportion as the work done in compression
 san 1842 i
 main isi bhaavana kaa upyog julius rabart mir ne, jo us samay keval 28 varsh kaa tha or germany ke hylebron nagar main doctor tha, is baat kii gananaa ke liye kiya ki ek calories ushma utpann karne ke liye kitna kaary aavashyak he
 We know that each gas has two specific heat: one at a fixed volume and the other at a fixed pressure
 pehali avasthaa main gas koi kaary nahin karti
 In the second stage, the gas has to work against the external pressure and the difference between the two specific heat is equivalent to this work
 is tarah mir ko ushma ke yantric tulyank kaa jo maan praapt hua vah lagbhag utana hi tha jitna count rumford ko praapt hua tha
 At the same time in England, James Prescott Joule was also engaged in extracting a mechanical equivalent of heat
 iske prayog san 1842 i
 se san 1852 i
 tak chalate rahe
 In its experiment, it took water in a copper thermometer and churned it with a churner
 mathni ko do ghiraniyon par se latake hue do bhaaron par chalaaya jaataa tha
 The door with which these loads were hanging was wrapped in the end of this churn and when these loads were falling down, the churn used to rotate
 jab ye bhaar neeche girte the to inaki sthitij urja kam ho jaati thi
 Part of this reduction was converted into kinetic energy of loads and some part was spent moving the churn
 is tarah yah gyaat kiya ja saktaa tha ki mathni ko ghumne main kitna kaary kiya ja rahaa tha
 With the increase in the temperature of the thermometer water, it could be known how much heat was generated; And then the mechanical equilibrium of heat could be found
 jul ne ye prayog pani tathaa paara donon ke saath kiye
 In 1847, Hermann Phan Helmholts wrote a book in which heat-indestructibility theory was given by examples of various fields such as heat, magnet, electricity, physicochemical etc
 jul ne prayog dwaara vaidyut urja tathaa ushma-urja kii samanta siddh kii
 See - Electrical Energy san 1905 i
 main ainstin ne apana aapekshik siddhant pratipaadit kiya jiske anusaar kanon kaa dravyaman unki gatij urja par nirbhar rahata he
 This means that the value of energy is obtained by multiplying the mass increase by the square of the velocity of light
 is siddhant kii pushti nabhikeey vigyaan ke bahut se prayogon dwaara hoti he
 This is how energy is produced in the sun
 surya main ek shrinkhal kriya hoti he jiskaa fal yah hota he ki hydrogen ke chaar nabhikon ke sanyog se helium kaa nabhik ban jaataa he
 The mass of the four nuclei of hydrogen is slightly more than the nucleus of helium

 arthath vyakaran main sangya yaa sarvnaam shabd kii vah avasthaa jiske dwaara vaakya main uskaa kriya ke saath sambandh prakat hota he use kaarak kehete hai
 
 kaarak yah ingit karata he ki vaakya main sangya yaa sarvnaam kaa kaam kya he
 Factors can be seen in many forms - kuch bhashaaon main sangya or sarvnaam ke atirikt visheshan or kriyavisheshan main bhi vikaar aate hai
 Just like in Sanskrit - 'sheetlane Jalen' has an adjective 'sheetlane'
 vibhinn bhashaaon main karkon kii sankhya tathaa kaarak ke anusaar shabd kaa rup-parivartan bhinn-bhinn hota he
 Sanskrit and other ancient Indian languages have eight factors
 german bhashaa main chaar kaarak hai
 Causative inflection - The nouns or pronouns followed by the words 'ne, ko, se, for', etc

 hindi main aath kaarak hote hai
 They can be seen below with inflection marks- kaarak - - vibhakti chihn 1
 Karta Prathama - 2
 karm dwitiya -- ko 3
 Karan - to, with, by 4
 sampradaan -- ke liye, ko 5
 Dedicated - from 6
 sambandh -- kaa, ke, kii, raa, re, ri 7
 Tribunal - In, on 8
 sambodhan -- he ! are ! o! This verse has been created to remember the causative sign- vishesh - karta se adhikaran tak vibhakti chihn shabdon ke ant main lagaae jate hai, kintu sambodhan kaarak ke chihn-he, re, aadi praayah shabd se purv lagaae jate hai
 The form in which the verb is understood by the person doing the action is called the 'doer' factor
 iskaa vibhakti-chihn ‘ne’ he
 This 'ne' sign is not used in the present and future
 iskaa sakarmak dhaatuon ke saath bhootkaal main prayog hota he
 Like- 1
 Ram killed Ravana
 2
ladki skool jaati he
 The subject of the verb in the first sentence is Rama
 isamen ‘ne’ karta kaarak kaa vibhakti-chihn he
 In this sentence, 'mara' is a past verb
 ‘ne’ kaa prayog praayah bhootkaal main hota he
 In the second sentence, the subject of the present tense is the girl
 isamen ‘ne’ vibhakti kaa prayog nahin hua he
 In the past, even with the subject of the intransitive verb, there is no synonym
 jaise-vah hansaa
 The verb is not used with the subject of the transitive verb of present and future
 jaise-vah fal khaataa he
 He will eat the fruit
 kabhi-kabhi karta ke saath ‘ko’ tathaa ‘sa’ kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 like- balak ko so janaa chahie
 The book was read from Sita
 rogi se chalaa bhi nahin jaataa
 The word was not written from him
 kriya ke kaary kaa fal jis par padataa he, vah karm kaarak kehalaata he
 Its inflection is 'ko'
 yah chihn bhi bahut-se sthanon par nahin lagata
 Like- 1
 Mohan killed the snake
 2
 ladki ne patr likhaa
 In the first sentence, the action of 'kill' has resulted in a snake
 atah saanp karm kaarak he
 The prefix 'ko' is attached to it
 duusare vaakya main ‘likhane’ kii kriya kaa fal patr par padaa
 Hence letter is the karm factor
 isamen karm kaarak kaa vibhakti chihn ‘ko’ nahin laga
 The form of the noun, etc
, with the help of the means of performing the verb, that is, with the help of which the work is done, it is called Karan Karkar
 iske vibhakti-chihn ‘se’ ke ‘dwaara’ he
 Like- 1
 Arjun killed Jayadratha with an arrow
 2
balak gend se khel rahe he
 In the first sentence, the doer Arjun did the act of killing with the arrow
 atah ‘baan se’ karan kaarak he
 In the second sentence, the doers are doing the task of playing the child 'with the ball'
 atah ‘gend se’ karan kaarak he
 Sampradaya means give
 arthath karta jiske liye kuch kaary karata he, athwa jise kuch detaa he use vyakt karne vaale rup ko sampradaan kaarak kehete hai
 The taker is called the denominator
 iske vibhakti chihn ‘ke liye’ ko hai
 1
 Greet the sun for health

guruji ko fal do
 In these two sentences 'for health' and 'guruji ko' are sampradaya factors
 sangya ke jis rup se ek vastu kaa duusari se alag hona paaya jaae vah apadan kaarak kehalaata he
 Its inflection mark is 'from'
 jaise- 1
baccha chat se gir padaa
 2
 Sangita fell from the horse
 in donon vaakyon main ‘chat se’ or ghode ‘se’ girane main alag hona prakat hota he
 Hence there are aberrations from horse and roof
 shabd ke jis rup se kisi ek vastu kaa duusari vastu se sambandh prakat ho vah sambandh kaarak kehalaata he
 Its inflection symbol is 'ka', 'K', 'ki', 'ra', 're', 'ri'
 jaise- 1
yah radheshyaam kaa betaa he
 2
 It is Kamla's cow
 in donon vaakyon main ‘radheshyaam kaa bete’ se or ‘kamala kaa’ gaay se sambandh prakat ho rahaa he
 Hence the relation here is causative
 jahaan ek sangya yaa sarvnaam kaa sambandh duusari sangya yaa sarvnaam se suchit hota he, vahaan sambandh kaarak hota he
 Of its inflection mark, ki, k; Ra, Ri, Ray; Na, ne, ne
 jaise- Ram's boy, Shyam's girl, Geeta's children
 meraa ladkaa, meri ladki, hamaare bachche
 Apna boy, apna girl, apne boy
 shabd ke jis rup se kriya ke aadhaar kaa bodh hota he use adhikaran kaarak kehete hai
 Its diacritics are 'in', 'on'
 jaise- 1
bhanvaraa phulon par mandra rahaa he
 2
 TV in the room Is kept
 in donon vaakyon main ‘phulon par’ or ‘kamare main’ adhikaran kaarak he
 By which the feeling of calling or alerting someone is called an address factor and an address mark is put
 jaise- 1
are bhaiya ! kyon ro rahe ho ? 2
he gopal ! yahan aao
 In these sentences 'hey Bhaiya' and 'hey Gopal'! Addressing factor

 This trend was reflected in the efforts that led to the development of traditional Indian psychology-based approaches, which we had taken from ancient texts and scriptures
