 barnouli ne dekha ki is anukram ko nimnanusaar taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he: Where n is the number of interest compounded in a year
 niyamit masik bhugtan ke saath ek rin kii bakaayaa raashi ko prabharee masik byaaj dwaara sanvardhit kiya jaataa he or bhugtan dwaara kam kar diya jaataa he, isliye where, punrarit pratisthaapan dwaara vyakti Bk ke liye abhivyakti praapt kar saktaa he, jo raikhik rup se B0 or p ke liye anupatik hai or ek jyamitiya shrinkhalaa ke ek aanshik yoga formula kaa upyog nimna ko parinamit karata he, a solution of this expression for p in terms of B0 and Bn is reduced to n bhugtanon main rin ko puri tarah se adaa karne ke liye bhugtan raashi kaa pataa lagane ke liye vyakti Bn = 0 set karata he
 The PMT functions found in spreadsheet programs can be used to calculate the monthly payment of a loan: vartmaan bakaayaa raashi par ek keval byaaj bhugtan nimna hoga, The total interest on the loan, the IT payment will be, ek niyamit bachat kaarykram ke liye sutara samaan hai, lekin bhugtanon ko bakaayaa raashi se ghataane ke bajaaye usamen joda jaataa he or bhugtan ke liye sutara uparokt se nakaaratmak he
 These formulas are only approximate because the actual outstanding debt is affected by the rounding
 rin ke ant main alp bhugtan karne se bachane ke liye bhugtan ko agle saint tak badhanaa chahie
 In this case the final payment should be Bn-1 ek samaan rin par vichaar karen, lekin uparokt sawaal ke samay avadhi ke k ke baraabar ek nai avadhi ke saath
 yadi rk or pk nae dar or bhugtan hai, ab hamaare paas he, Comparing this expression with Bk shows us, pichhlaa sameekaran hamen donon samasyaon ke liye ek hi sthir ko paribhaashit karne kaa avasar detaa he, And Bk can be written, rk ke liye sulajhaate hue hame rk ke liye ek formula praapt hota he jisamen shaamil hota he gyaat maatra or Bk, jo k avadhi ke baad bakaayaa dhan hota he, As B0 can be any outstanding balance of debt, this formula separates any two outstanding amounts divided by the k period and can be used to calculate the value for the annual interest rate
 B* ek aparivartaneey paimaana he kyonki yah avadhi kii lambaai main parivartan ke saath parivartit nahin hoti
 By reversing the equation for b *, one obtains a coefficient of change, or ham yah dekhte hai ki r or p ek hi tareeke se badalte hai, This is how the outstanding balance changes, jo uparokt formulon main paae jane vaale kuch gunankon ke arth main ek antardrushti pradaan karata he
 The annual rate, r12, considers only one payment per year and is not an "effective rate" for monthly payments

 If a person makes only interest payments, the amount paid for the year is 12
r
b0
 pk = rk B* ko Bk ke liye sameekaran main sthanapann karne par hame miltaa he, After Bn = 0 we can also solve for b *, Bk ke liye formula main waapas sthanapann karnaa yah darshata he ki yah ek rk raikhik kaary he or isliye λk, This is the easiest way to estimate the outstanding amount if λk is known
 uparokt Bk ke liye pehle formule main sthanapann karke or λk+1 liye hal dhundne par ham pate hai, Λ0 and λn can be found using the λk formula above or by calculating the alternating λk from λ0 = 0 to λn
 jabaki p = rb* bhugtan ke liye formul nimnlikhit tak kam ho jaataa he, And average interest rate over the term of the loan is jo r se kam hota he agar n>1 he

 Listening to his challenge, instead of getting angry, Chitraratha came to Arjun smiling and said, “O Partha! i am your friend vastav main dusht duryodhana apni sena ke saath tum logon kaa vadh karne ke liye yahan aayaa tha
 Devraj Indra had received information about this, so he sent me here

 The circulatory system or vasosphere is the set of organs that carry the transport of nutrients between the cells of the body
 isse rogon se sharir kii raksha hoti he tathaa sharir kaa taap evam ph sthir bana rahata he
 Amino acids, electrolytes, gases, hormones, blood cells and nitrogen waste products etc
 are transported by the circulatory system

 Many trivial systems do not have a circulating system
 kintu sabhi praaniyon kaa lasika tantra ek khulaa tantra hota he
 Vascular system is the name of a group of heart, arteries and veins
 dhamniyon or shiraaon ke bich keshikaon kaa vistrut samooh bhi isi tantra kaa bhaag he
 The function of this system is to transport blood to each part of the body, so that it can get nutrition and oxygen
 is tantra kaa centre hriday he, jo rudhir ko nirantar pump karata rahata he or dhamniyaan ve vahikaaye hai jinamein hokar rudhir angon main pahunchataa he tathaa keshikaon dwaara vitarit hota he
 Nutrition and oxygen from the capillary blood move into the tissues and they bring the blood without this nutrition and oxygen back to the vein which sends it to the lungs to take oxygen
 antra se avashoshit hokar poshak avyav bhi is rudhir main mil jate hai or phir se is rudhir ko angon main oxigen tathaa poshan pahunchaane ke liye dhamniyon dwaara bhej diya jaataa he
 It is a four-legged hollow organ made of muscular tissue, located on the left side, inside the thoracic, at the top, at the middle of the second retina and the sixth perpendicular at the bottom

 There are two cells on the right and two on the left
 dahini or bai ore ke koshth ke bich main ek vibhaajak pat hai, jo donon ore ke rudhir ko milane nahin detaa
 On each side there is a vault upwards, which is called the atrium and the bottom vault is called the ventricle
 daahine nilay main urdhv ore adho mahashiraaon ke do chhidr hai, jinke dwaara rudhir lautakar hriday main aata he
 a large opening is between the atrium and ventricle, on which the capillary is attached

 The papillary muscles also become narrower, causing the condyle cord to expand and the cervix of the capillaries are not able to overturn in the atrium
 is prakaar ke prabandh se rudhir keval ek hi disha main, alind se nilay main, ja saktaa he
 There are also crescent capillaries on the pleural and aortic vents
 uparyukt varnan se spasht hai ki rudhir mahashiraaon sak daahine alind main aata he
 From there, it goes into the ventricle at the time of exertion
 nilay ke sankuchit hone par phupfusi dhamni main hota hua phupfus main chalaa jaataa he
 Taking oxygen there, the blood enters the left atrium by four pulmonary veins and when it is contracted, the blood enters the left ventricle

 As the branches grow, their size gets smaller
 ye chote akaarwali dhamnikaaye kehalaati hai
 The proximal branches of the arteries merge with each other, so that if the path of one is cut off or stops due to disease, then it reaches blood from the other artery to the expansion area
 isko shakhamilan kehete hai
 There are two main arteries arising from the heart, the pleura and the aorta

 It is difficult to create sections or sections of dictionaries in terms of subjects
 alag alag koshkar apni samaj ke anusaar is prakaar ke vishayvibhag banaaya karte the
 There was neither any fixed order nor could it happen
 isaliye logon ko praaia: sara kosh kanthsth karnaa padataa tha
 For this reason, dictionaries in Western countries started being made alphabetically
 aise kosh ratane nahin padate the or aavashyaktaanusaar jab jiskaa ji chahta tha, tab vah uskaa upyog kar saktaa tha
 Nowadays, in almost all countries and all languages, this sequence is being used in the field of thesaurus: which is the most important in terms of the curious
 isi liye kosh ke jitne prakaar hote hai, un sab main praaia: aksharkram kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are many types of thesaurus, but considering the meaning, they can be divided into two parts
 ek to ve jinamein kisi bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth or vivechan usee bhashaa main hote he or duusare ve jinamein ek bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaaon me die jate hai
 There can be many types of thesaurus with the idea of subject, such as Mathematics dictionary, Legal dictionary, Medical dictionary etc
 aise koshon kii ginati praaia: shabdaawaliyon main hoti he, jaise krishi shabdaawalee, darshanik shabdaawalee, bhugolic shabdaawalee aadi
 Apart from these, some specific poets, dialects etc
 also have different lexicons, such as Tulsi Kosh, Sur Kosh, Awadhi Kosh, Brajbhasha Kosh, etc
 kisi vishisht vishay ke mahatvapurn granth main aae hue mukhya pratikon, vishyon yaa shabdon ke jo kosh yaa talikaay hoti he, unhen kramaat pratikanukramanika, vishayanukramanika yaa shabdanukramanika kehete hai
 Lexicography is an art
 is kala kaa gyaan vartmaan yug kii param unnat bhashaaon ke shabdkoshon kaa sookshm drushti se adhyayan karne par praapt ho saktaa he
 Editing of good and authentic thesaurus cannot be done only on the strength of scholarship, as long as the art of lexicography is also fully understood and the knowledge of this art can only come from the lifelong study of the lexicon
 sabhi prakaar ke kosh kisi vishesh uddeshy tathaa kisi vishesh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye hi banaae jate hai
 Therefore, this purpose or need is mainly taken care of in the lexicon
 duusare, is baat kaa bhi baraabar dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki uskaa sara kalevar sabhi drushtiyon se santulit rahe; aisa na ho ki koi ang to aavashyaktaa yaa auchity se adhik bad jaae or koi uski tulana main kshinkaay yaa hin jaan pade
 The words should also be discussed and the order of the organs of that thought should always remain the same
 shabdon kii bhi jatiyaan yaa varg hote hai, at: ek jati yaa varg ke sab shabdon kaa sara vivechan ek sa hona chahie
 If examples of authentic texts or writers are taken, then the same fraction should be taken, in which the intention is clear and the curious is resolved
 achche koshon main sabhi prakaar ke kshetron or vishyon ke paribhaashik shabd bhi rahete hai
 Therefore, the editor should have general knowledge or understanding of more and more subjects
 aavashyaktaa hone par kisi anjaane yaa nae vishay ke achche or pramanik granth se yaa uske achche gyaata se bhi sahaayta lenaa aavyashk hota he
 In the work of lexicography, the vision should be very wide and the instinct should be honeycomb
 drushti itani paini or sookshm honi chahie jo sahaj main nir ksheer kaa vivek kar saken or puraani trutiyon, dosha, bhuulon aadi ko dhundkar sahaj main unka sanshodhan tathaa sudhaar kar sake
 In the lexicon, there should also be no partiality or malicious name
 uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy hona chahie bhashaa tathaa sahitya kii seva
 In the lexicon, the primacy is only of meanings and thoughts, so there should not be any spread or overlap in them
 sabhi baaten nappi tuli, maryaadit or yathasadhay sankshipt honi chahie
 The maximum and concrete information in the dictionary should be presented in minimum words
 phaltu yaa bharti kii baton ke liye kosh main sthaan nahin hota
 Some forms of words are normative and many forms are spatial or provincial
 jin sthanik yaa prantiy shabdon ke maanak rup praapt hon, unka sara vivechan unheen maanak shabdon ke antargat rahanaa chahie or unke sthanik yaa prantiy roopon ke aage unke maanak roopon kaa abhidesh maatr hona chahie
 This has the great advantage that other linguists readily learn the standard form of the words and help the standard form of the language to be constant — that the form of the language is not deteriorated by the unfamiliar
 yahi baat aise sanskrit shabdon ke sambandh main bhi honi chahie jiske bahut se paryaay hon
 Like lotus, river, mountain, sea etc
 shabdon ke aage unke paryaay dete samay bhi is baat kaa dhyaan rahanaa chahie ki paryaay vahi die jaae jo mul shabd kaa thik aashay yaa maap bataanevaale hon
 It is advisable to abandon those environments in such contexts, due to which confusion may arise
 koshkaron ke saamne idhar haal main webster kii new world dictionari ne ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he jo bahut hi upyogi tathaa upadey hone ke kaaran shabdkoshon ke liye vishesh anukaraniya he

 aisa yah soch kaa kiya gaya he ki koshkar kaa kaam shabdon ke arth batala dene se hi samaapt nahin ho jaataa, varan isse bhi aage badhkar uskaa kaam logon ko shabdon ke thik prayog batalaana hota he
 We will find hundreds of thousands of such words, whose subtle differences can be revealed, and thus the curious can be made to think about the words in a new way
 haal ke achche or bade angareji koshon main ek or nai tathaa upyogi paripati chali he jo bhartiya bhashaaon ke koshon ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi ho sakati he
 In all languages, there are many compound words which are formed by prefixing
 kanishtha se akanishtha, karaniya se akaraniya, apekshit se anpekshit, aavashyak se anaavashyak, mantri se upamantri, samiti se upasmiti, paalan se paripaalan, bhraman se paribhraman, karm se pratikarm, vidhaan se pratividhan aadi
 The number of such words formed by the sum of prefixes is very large
 aise shabdon do virgon main bante hote hai athwa baante ja sakate hai
 For one, the words whose words are not combined with any new or specific meaning in the former verse and the answer word, which is why they live under ordinary words
 aise shabdon or unke arthon se kosh kaa kalevar bahut bad jaataa he
 To avoid this kind of meaningless expansion, this new method has been adopted in the new dictionaries of Webster that they are not considered as independent words and hence their meanings have not been taken
 prishth ke ant main ek rekha ke neeche aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de di gai he, yatha-an-dizyrd, an-disterbd, an-free, an-hart, an-invited aadi
 Yes, unlike these, there are certain words of other class in which some new meanings are derived from the addition of prefixes
 jaise visheshan rup main akach kaa rup bina balonvala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah ketu grah kaa bhi ek naam he
 Anagar means not only a householder, but in noun form he is also a signifier of a monk
 isaliye aise shabd lenaa aavashyak hota he
 The words whose meanings are automatically destroyed by the sum of predecessor and post-apocalyptic, it is considered futile to take meaning in the dictionary
 at: prishthant main aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de dena yathesht hoga
 Yes, the compound words in which a new and special meaning is derived from the sum of the two terms, it is necessary to take them in the same place as the meaning
 hamaare yahan ke puraane sanskrit koshon kii paddati yah rahi he ki ati, prati sah aadi ke yoga se bananevaale shabd apane purv padwale shabd ke antargat ek hi sheershak main ek saath de die jate he
 Some dictionaries of Hindi have also followed this practice
 yadhyapi sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se yah paddati yuktisangat hoti he, phir bhi sanskrit koshon tak main inkaa puraa puraa paalan hota hua nahin dikhaai detaa
 There is some saving of space in this, but it becomes very difficult for exceptional readers to find the words
 kabhi kabhi to aise logon ke liye bhi is paddati se shabd dhoondhna kathin hota he jo iske niyamon or siddhanton se bahut kuch parichit hote hai
 In every language, there are some words which are also invariant, adverbs, adjectives, suffix nouns etc
 with the idea of different meanings and are also derived from different roots, ie Hindi is also a noun, adjective and suffix
 Too
 apane sangya rup main bhi vah apane kai arthon main kuch alag alag mulon se vyutpann he
 Such words are considered to be separate and independent words in modern and superior English lexicons and are treated with different titles, viz
 English also has a vise adjective, noun and suffix also and in three forms its titles are kept separately

 'bajirao mastaani' ek bhartiya aitihaasik romance film he jiskaa nirdesan or nirmaan sanjay lila bhansaali ne kiya he
 The film tells about Peshwa Bajirao of the Maratha Empire and his second wife Mastani
 ranvir singh or deepika padukon ne ye donon mukhya kirdaar nibhaae hai, priyanka chopra ne bajirao kii pehali patni kaa va tanvi aazmi ne bajirao kii maan kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 Bajirao Mastani is released on 18 December 2015
 bajirao mastaani film kii shuruyaat nae peshwa banane se shuru hoti he iske liye bajirao ko chunaa jaataa he iske baad is khushi main sabhi samrajya ke log khushi manaate hai
 Then suddenly Mastani from Bundelkhand comes to the aid and after fighting Bajirao's soldiers directly meets Bajirao and convinces him to take him to Bundelkhand where he fights with both the rivals and conquers there
 iske baad bajirao bundelkhand main holi manaate he isi bich bajirao or mastaani main pyaar ho jaataa he
 On the second day, Bajirao goes back to Pune
 isi bich jate vaqt bajirao mastaani ko apni kataar de ke jate hai is kaaran bundelkhand main kataar se vivaah ho jaataa he is parampara ke tahat mastaani pune jaati he
 There she meets Radhabai, Bajirao's mother
 radhabai mastaani ko nahin chaahati he is kaaran wo nafrat karne lagati he
 After this, Chimaji Appa shows Shaniwarwada and also shows amazing Ainamahal
 mastaani jab radhabai se rishte ko maanane liye kahati he to wo ghunghru dekar kahati he ki ab se tumhaara rishta ho gaya he ab se tum mehafil main naachogi
 Then Chhatrapati Sahu is invited from Satara, then Bajirao goes there, then Radhabai goes a new trick and sends Mastani by giving it to Gungroo but Mastani reaches there and puts Ghungroo in front of Gungru Chhatrapati Sahu, due to this, the Pant representative considered insult to the Mahfil
 But when Chhatrapati Sahu comes to know that she is the daughter of King Chhatrasal, he bites her to go back and says that you Or should he Mastani speaks that i should Baji is in love with Baji
 iske pashchaat mastaani bajirao kii pratiksha karti he us vaqt tufaan aa jaataa he or bajirao vahaan aakar mastaani se vivaah kar detaa he
 Meanwhile, Kashibai also comes to know and she also gets angry
 phir kashibai or mastaani ke putr hote he or unka namakaran kiya jaataa he
 Kashibai's son is named Raghunath while Mastani's son is named Samasher Bahadur
 isi bich bajirao or chimaji appa ke bich ladaai ho jaati he
 Bajirao tells everyone that he will bring Mastani to Shaniwarwada on Saptami day, but Krishnabhata and Radhabai tell them not to do it
 yah film suprasiddh marathi upanyaaskaar nagnath inaamdaar ke utkrisht aitihaasik upanyaas rau par aadhaarit he
 This novel is one of the successful historical novels not only in Marathi but also in the entire Indian languages
 isamen itihaas evam itihaas-ras donon kii raksha karte hue utkrisht sarjanaatmakataa kaa parichay diya gaya he
 There is naturally a lot of drama in this novel and while reading, it seems as if someone is watching a good serial
 iske varnanaatmak drishy bhi chalchitr ke drishyon kii tarah maanas-patal par ankit rah jate hai
 Being based on such a novel, a number of features have naturally come into the film
 sanjay lila bhansaali jaise siddhhast nirdeshak ke dwaara yah kahani or bhi chamak uthi he
 It is natural for the film to make some difference from the text, as the mediums of the two are different, but in this film some differences have been deliberately introduced in the form of film shots and shakes, which has shocked the perception of history
 aarambhik drishyon main bajirao ko peshwa niyukt karne vaala drishy to bahut hi uttam evam upyukt bhi he, or upanyaas se baahar kaa hote hue bhi aitihaasikta evam itihaas-bodh ke sarvatha anuroop he; parantu jis drishy main kashibai kii puraani saheli aati he, jiskaa pati peshwa bajirao ke kaaran maaraa gaya he or isliye vah apane pati kii raakh vahaan chhod kar ek tarah se shaap detii he, vahaan spasht antar aa gaya he
 In the novel, Kashibai has a dignified presence as a skilled housewife, while in the film, Kashibai is seen leaping towards a playful teenager, unraveling history
 filmkaar yah bhi bhul gaya he ki jis kashibai kaa vah aisa filmakan kar rahaa he uskaa betaa jawan ho rahaa he or vahi us utsav kaa mukhya karta-dharta tha
 Here, instead of Kashibai Peshwa's wife, the film heroine seems to be 'priyanka Chopra'
 chhatrasaal kii sahaayta ke liye bajirao ko mastaani ke dwaara sena sahit le janaa bhi bilkul anaitihaasik rup vaala ho gaya he
 Very interesting to see, but neither did it, nor could it happen by Mastani
 is prakaar ke chote-mote drishyon ko chhod bhi den tab bhi do akshamya bhoolen filmkaar ne kii hai-- shrimant bajirao peshwa or kashibai donon ko alag alag samay main nachvaa daalaa he
 In that era and in the Peshwa family, a woman like Kashibai, who was in a way a queen, would not have needed to keep dancers exclusively if she danced
 usamen bhi khaas baat yah he ki jis samay film main kashibai ko mastaani ke saath nachaaya gaya he, un dinon uske pair main baraabar rahane vaala dard or bhi badha hua tha
 Kashibai's meeting with Mastani has also turned out to be a different way and the film is shaky
 atah aitihaasikta ke saath rachanaatmak anand ke liye to ukt upanyaas hi padhanaa hoga, parantu mahan bajirao peshwa evam mastaani kii apurv premgautha evam durdharsh jivan ko maharashtra se baahar bhi jan-jan tak pahunchaane kaa kaary is film ne prabal rup se kiya he, iske liye filmkaar avashya dhanyavad ke paatr hai
 The acting of almost all the actors is also lively and admirable, which motivates the film to watch again and again
 varsh 2003 main sanjay lila bhansaali ne is film ke mukhya kirdaar ke liye salmaan khan or aishwarya raay ko chunaa tha
 Who was also in the lead role in his film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam
 par baad main unhen un donon ke bich hue matbhed ke kaaran badalanaa padaa
 After this, in July 2003, he selected Kareena Kapoor and Rani Mukerji to play Bajirao's wife
 bhansaali ji ne coffee vid karan main yah bataaya kii ve salmaan khan or karina kapur ko isliye nahin le paae kyonki ve pehle hi kisi anya film main kaary kar rahe the
 It was also rumored among some that Shah Rukh Khan will play this role in place of Ajay Devgan
 iske alaava isamen ruthik roshan or deepika padukon ranvir singh or katrina caff ke rahane kii sambhaavna thi
 In July 2014, Bhansali verified that Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone were chosen as the lead characters in the project

 san 1854 main baraar or san 1856 main avadh ko company ke rajya main mila liya gaya
 Various political, economic, religious, military and social reasons are given for the revolt of 1857
 kai itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki us samay ke janamanas main yah dharna thi ki, angrej unhen jabardasti yaa dhokhe se isai bananaa chaahate hai
 This was not completely wrong either, some company officers were engaged in the work of conversion

 The company was aware that religion could become a cause of rebellion in traditional Indian society

 These people were ready to avenge their embarrassment and defeat at the hands of the British

 Apart from this, many soldiers in the Bengal Army of the East India Company were recruited from Awadh, they could not remain untouched by the happenings in Awadh
 nagpur ke shahi gharaane ke aabhushanon kii kalakatta main boli lagaayi gayi is ghatana ko shahi parivaar ke prati anadar ke rup main dekha gaya
 Indians were also angered by the harsh governance of the company which was spreading rapidly and spreading western civilization

 These laws caused anger in some sides of society, mainly in Bengal
 angrejon ne bal vivaah pratha ko samaapt kiya tathaa kanya bhrun hatya par bhi roak lagaayi
 Cheating was also abolished by the British, but there is still doubt whether the thugs were a religious community or just a community of ordinary dacoits
 britani nyaay vyavastha bharatiyon ke liye anyaaypurna maani jaati thi
 In 1853, British Prime Minister Lord Abredin opened the administrative service to Indians, but according to some enlightened Indians, this improvement was not enough

 a major cause of the 1857 rebellion was the economic exploitation of Indians by the company

 dandi sanskrit bhashaa ke prasiddh sahityakar hai
 There is a lack of authentic information regarding his life
 kuch vidwaan inhen saatvin shatee ke uttarardh yaa aathvin shatee ke prarambh kaa maanate hai to kuch vidwaan inkaa janm 550 or 650 i0 ke madhya maanate hai
 The question of when Dandi took place and what are his compositions is still controversial
 unka jeevanavrutt bhi vishesh gyaat nahin he
 Based on both 'avantisundari Katha' and 'avantisundari Kathasar' available in South India, so much has been known about his life that Damodar Pandit, the great-grandfather of Dandi was
 ve kadachit bharavi ke mitra the
 With his help, the Chalukyavanshi could reach near King Vishnuvardhana
 bharavi kii chauthi peedi main dandi kaa janm huatha
 He lived his life in the shelter of Kanchinaresh
 kannada bhashaa ke alankarigranth 'kavrajmarg' par dandi ke 'kavyadarsh' kaa yathesht prabhaav dekhakar tathaa sinhalai ke alankarigranth 'sita-bas-lakar' ko kavyadarsh ke aadharaper nirmit paakar itnaa nishchit he ki naveen shatabdi se purv dandi vartmaan the
 Thus 'laxm Laxmi Tanotiti', based on a famous passage of Kalidasa from this quote, the period of Dandi is indiscriminately post Kalidasa
 produo pathak ke mat se kavyadarsh kaa hetuvishyak vibhaag -- bhartruhari ke aadhaar par hone se kavyadarsh kii rachana 650 itho ke baad hui hogi
 Kavyadarshakta Rajavarma can be considered as the late seventh century and the eighth beginning of Dandi, as against those who consider Narasimhavarma ii's surname or surname
 yadi 'kavyadarsh' ke ek shloke par kadambari ke shuknashopadesh kaa prabhaav sweekaar kiya jaay to unka kaal -- banbhatta ke bhi ananthar hota he
 The above statement is also confirmed by the opinion of those who consider Avantisundari Kathasar as a masterpiece
 parantu kuch vidwaan dandi ko subandhu se purv or kuch log unhen banbhatta kaa bhi purvavarti maanate hai
 According to the second vote, Subandhu, Dandi and Baan - all three were born between 550 AD and 650 AD
 in logon ke mat se 'avantisundari katha' yaa 'kathasaar' ko dandikrut maanane main aapatti he
 According to the legend and Subhashit, three compositions of Dandi are described as Vishruta
 pratham rachana 'kavyadarsh' or duusari he 'dashakumarcharit'
 Most scholars have accepted this, but some other scholars - assuming both of them to be a litterateur, assume the creation of two different persons named Dandi
 iskaa ek pramukh kaaran yah he ki kavyashastra ke jin maanya siddhanton kaa 'kavyadarsh' main pratipaadan or nirdesh miltaa he, 'dashakumarcharit' main uski asangati or virodh dikhaai detaa he
 Therefore, the inconsistency of the doctrine and practice of Acharya and Poetry indicates one or two different creations
 parantu adhiktar vidwaanon ke anusaar ukt asangati kaa kaaran yah maan liya gaya he ki apane saahitiyik jivan ke aarambhkaal main mahakavi ne 'dashakumarcharit' kii rachana kii thi
 'kavyadarsha' is the creation of maturity when the classical masculinity of Dandi matured
 at: in donon kritiyon ko dandi rachit maanane main adhiktar vidwaanon ko koi vipratipatti nahin he
 But the determination of the third work is still controversial
 'pirol' ke mat se shudrakarchit kaha janevaala 'mrichctic' hi dandi kii tritiy rachana he
 One of its grounds is the quotation of a line in 'kavyadarsha' without a name 'mruthaktik'
 doosraa kaaran he -- 'mrichauctic' or 'dashakumarcharit' donon main chitrit samaaj evam unke paatro ke charitrachitran main atyadhik samya
 The first reason is not an important reason
 doosraa keval itnaa hi suchit karata he ki donon hi kritiyaan praaia: samakaleen samaaj ke yugabodh kaa yathaarthonmukh or jeevant chithran karne main prayatnsheel hai
 'mallikamarut' is also sometimes called punitive
 par vah 15veen sadi ke 'udand ranganath' kii kriti he
 'avantisundarikatha' is now considered by many scholars to be the third composition of Dandi based on the stories of 'daskumarcharit'
 donon gadhykavyon kii shailigat bhinnata ko dekhakar kuch panditon ne uske dandikrut hone main aapatti kii he
 But other scholars accept the third composition of Dandi as unambiguous, considering it to be the construction of 'daskumarcharit' in the style of puberty and the 'avantisundarikatha' in the mature style of maturity
 kuch log -- 'avantisundarikatha' ko 'dashakumar charit' kii khoi hui purv peethika maanane lage hai
 'dasakumarcharit' is an important and famous work in three famous Sanskrit prose
 vah kavy kii kathastyli main likhit he
 Dashakumarcharit's linguistic style is more literary and poetic than the simple prose and practical prose style of 'mahabhashya' and ancient Upanishads, 'hitopadesh' etc
 parantu subandhu or baan kii alankrita evam kalatmak gadhyshailee se yah bhinn he
 Although the maturation of the miraculous ornate style of miracles is mature in Subandhu and mature in arrows, the characterization of characters and characters in both of them is bleak rather than 'decapitated'
 kalamulak adarshavadita ne 'vaasavadatta' or 'kadambari' kii style ko yatharthonmukh parivesh se dur hataakar kuch kritrim bana diya he
 But in Dandi's prose style, the effect of that 'extreme' and platitude is not borderline
 'dashakumarcharit' par sambhavat: pashachi bhashavali gunanty kii brihatkatha kaa prabhaav padaa he
 Probably for this reason, 'dashkumarcharit' has also influenced the stories of folklore
 kahani main duusari, teesri aadi kii shrunkhlaa ko jodne kaa rachanavidhan bhi yahan lakshith hota he
 It gives a very lively depiction of the weaknesses and strengths of the seventh eighth century society, the narrow and selfish political struggles of that period, the working weaknesses of the multitude of people, and the blind, superstitions and theoretical and practical hats of the Tadugin society
 vibhinn shreniyon or virgon ke vyaktimadhyam se kiye gaye vargparak charitrachitran main tatkaaleen samaaj kii sajiv jhaanki dikhaai padati he
 Overall, the poet has made sufficient marking of the real life of the era
 is granth kii purvapithika ke paanch uchhvas or uttar peethika ke ansh ko praaia: sabhi vidwaan dandi rachit nahin maanate
 They accept writing by other authors
 purvapithika or uttarpithika kii abhivyaktistylee madhya ke aath uchhvaason se bhinn he
 Validative descriptiveness in both also indicates different points of view
