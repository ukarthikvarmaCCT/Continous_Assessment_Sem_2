 Black Friday as a term has been used in many contexts; It dates back to the nineteenth century when it was combined with a financial crisis of 1869 in the United States
 "blike friday" ko thankgiving ke baad ke din ke rup main bataane vaala sabase praarambhik gyaat sandarbh philadelphia main is din ke mahatv par 1966 ke ek prakaashan main diya gaya tha: January 1966 - "black Friday" is the name given by the Philadelphia Police Department on the Friday following Thanksgiving Day
 yah unke prati prem kaa ek shabd nahin he
 "black Friday" officially marks the start of the Christmas shopping occasion in the city center and usually brings heavy traffic jams and overcrowding on the sidewalks when shops in the downtown commercial area from opening to closing It is packed full
 blike friday shabd kaa vyapak vistaar 1975 ke aas-paas hona shuru hua jaisaa ki 29 navambar 1975 ke do akhabaaron ke aalekhon main dikhaa gaya he, donon par philadelphia kii detaline maujuud he
 The first reference is in an article published in The New York Times titled "army Versus Navy: a Dimming Splendor": us din har saal thankgiving de or army-navy game ke bich - philadelphia kii police or bas chaalak ise "blike friday" kehete hai
 In Bicentennial City, it is the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year as the Christmas list gets ready and the end of the Eastern College Football season draws to a close

 "" They see it in the context of an opportunity that increases their headaches
 " However the term spread slowly and in 1985 the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term
 kai vyapaariyon ne varsh ke sabase mahatvapurn kharidari ke dinon main se ek ke sandarbh main kisi nakaaratmak shabd ke istemaal par aapatti jaahir kii thi
 By the early 1980s an alternative theory began to be promoted: which is that retailers traditionally run their businesses at a financial disadvantage for most of the year and earned their profits during the holiday season Beginning the next day of Thanksgiving
 jab ise vittiya recordon main darj kiya jaataa, ek samay kii saamaanya lekhankan sambandhi prathaon main laal syaahi kaa prayog nakaaratmak raashi ko dikhaane ke liye or kaali syaahi kaa prayog sakaaratmak raashi ko dikhaane ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 Under this theory, Black Friday is the beginning of a period where retailers no longer make losses but take the year's profits back home
 sabase praarambhik gyaat prayog jo uparokt 1966 ke udhaaharan kii tarah he, jiskaa pataa american dialect sosayadi ke boni tailor-blake ne lagaaya tha, vah 1981 main philadelphia kaa hi he or yah "kaali syaahi" ke siddhant ko kai pratispardhi sambhaavnaaon main se ek ke rup main prastut karata he: If this day is the biggest day of the year for retailers then why is it called Black Friday? cheri hill mal ke gres mikaphili ne kaha, kyonki yah ek aisa din he jab khudara vikreta munaafaa -- kaali syaahi kamaate hai
 William Timmons of Strawbridge & Clodear said "I think it came from the media
 " Belle Stephens of Moorsstown Mall said "we are all employees, we only call it Black Friday
 " "ham atirikt mehnat se kaam karte hai
 It is a long day of hard work for employees
 " The Christmas shopping opportunity is of great importance to American retailers, and although most retailers want to make profits every quarter of the year and actually earn, some retailers rely so much on the Christmas shopping opportunity
 Are that they get a year's profit in the Christmas quarter and also compensate for the losses in other quarters

 In 2008, a crowd of about 2,000 buyers waited outside the local wal-mart at 5:00 am in New York's Valley Stream
 khulne kaa samay kareeb aate-aate bheed kaaphi baichaiyn ho uthi thi or jab daravaaje khule to bheed daravaaje ko todate hue or ek 34 varshiya karmchaaree ko kuchalate hue teji se aage badi jisase us vyakti kii maut ho gayi
 The buyers did not seem to have had any concern about the victim's execution, when other employees tried to intervene and help the injured employee, the mob refused to stop their railroad, complaining that they Been waiting for a long time in winter and don't want to wait anymore
 kharidaar pichhali shaam ko kam se kam 9:00 baje se hi vahaan jamaa hona shuru ho gaye the
 Even when the police arrived and tried to provide assistance to the injured person, the buyers made their way to enter the store, pushing and pushing the police officer and continued on
 Several others had minor injuries including a pregnant woman who had to be taken to hospital
 yah ghatana blike friday kii bikri ke dauraan maut kii sambhawatah pehali ghatana thi; neshnal retail federation ke anusaar, "hamen aisi kisi anya paristhiti kii jaankaree nahin he jahaan thankgiving ke agle din kaam karte hue kisi khudara vikreta karmchaaree kii maut hui ho

 In an episode reminiscent of the 2008 wal-mart's dangerous stampede in Buffalo, New York, a man was trampled when doors opened in a target store and crowds of unregistered shoppers entered the train
 yah dharna ki thankgiving ke agle din chuttee kii kharidari ke avasar kii "aadhikarik" shuruyaat hoti he, sambhawatah yah santa clos parade ke vichaar ke saath judi hui he
 The parade to commemorate the Thanksgiving event often involves the appearance of Santa Claus at the end of the parade with the idea that "santa Claus has arrived" or "santa is just around us"
 19veen sadi ke uttararddh or 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main kai santa paradeon yaa thankgiving de paradeon ko department storon dwaara pryojit kiya gaya tha
 These include the Toronto Santa Claus Parade sponsored by Atons in Canada and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade sponsored by Macy's
 Department stores used these parades to launch a large advertising campaign
 ant main yah sirf ek alikhit niyam ban gaya he ki parade khatm hone se pehle koi bhi store christmas vigyaapan karne kii koshish nahin karegaa
 isliye thankgiving ke baad kaa din vah din ban gaya jab aadhikarik taur par kharidari ke mausam kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Later, the fact that the shopping season had officially started, caused controversy
 1939 main khudara dukaanon ne kharidari ke ek apekshaakrit lambey mausam ko pasand kiya hoga, lekin koi bhi store apni parampara ko todna or thankgiving se pehle vigyaapan shuru karne waalon main se ek hona nahin chahta tha
 President Franklin D
 Roosevelt made the Thanksgiving date a week in advance, causing widespread anger among those who had to change their vacation plans
 kuch logon ne to badlaav se hi inkaar kar diya tha, jiske parinaam swaroop america nagarikon ne do alag-alag dinon main thankgiving samaaroh ko manaaya tha
 Some people began to call this change a franksgiving

 In recent years some retailers have claimed that advertisements they send as an advance for Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are trade secrets
 inamen se kuch khudara vikritaon ne aakraamak mulya suchi ko hataane ke ek madhyam ke rup main digital milinium copirite act kii tech-down pranali kaa upyog kiya he
 This policy is presumably designed out of fear that competitors will drop prices and buyers may compare stores

 The benefit of threatening Internet sites with a dmca-based lawsuit has ultimately proved to be weak
 jabaki kuch citon ne agrahon kaa paalan kiya he, dusron ne in dhamkiyon ko yaa to nazarandaaj kiya he yaa sirf sunne main ek samaan se lagane vaale kaalpanik khudara vikreta ke naam ke tahat in jaankariyon ko daalana jari rakhaa he
 Although the DMCA allows websites 24 hours to follow a take-down notice or file a counter-notice, careful use of time can reduce the impact of the take-down notice
 2003 main ek internet seva pradaata ne best by, cols or torget corporation ke khilaaf is tark ke saath ek muqadama daayar kiya ki dmsie kii tech-down notice ke praavdhaan asanvaidhanik hai
 The court dismissed the case, ruling that only third-party posters of advertisements, and not isps themselves, would be considered the basis for prosecuting retailers

 prasiddh doordarshan tivi dharawahik charitraheen ke nirdeshak krishna raghav isi gaanv se hai| a direct line motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy
 disi motor main bahut se aapas main sambhddha chaalkon kaa tantra rahata he, jo ek armechar par aropit hota he
 The armature is made by joining several plates of malleable iron and is cylindrical
 isamen chaaron ore khaanche kate hue hote hai, jinamein chaalak samoohon ko kundali athwa dandon ke rup main rakhaa jaataa he
 These drivers, according to a certain scheme, are interconnected
 is nishchit kram ko armechar kundalan kehete hai
 Different types of coils have specific characteristics, which have specific characteristics of specific types of coils, with distinct advantages
 chumbakeey kshetra bhi ek duusare chaalak samooh main se dhara ko pravaahit kar praapt kiya jaataa he
 Direct currents in armature drivers of motors are carried by Burroughs

 Are associated with the coils generating magnetic fields
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karanevaale kundalanon ko saamanyat: kshetra kundali kehete hai
 These coils may be associated with the armature coil in series or associated in parallel or in parallel
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki unke kuch kundalan shrenee main hon or kuch samaantar main
 Based on this combination of field coils, three different types of direct current motors are obtained - shrenee motor main jo dhara armechar main se hokar pravaahit hoti he, vahi kshetra kundali main bhi pravaahit hoti he
 Hence, there is very little coil of coarse wire in its field coil

 ” Fiqh is called Islamic theology
 fiqh musalamaanon ke liye islamic jivan ke har pahalu par apana asar rakhata he
 While the Shari'a calls that set of policy
 jo islamic kanoonee, paramparaon or islamic vyaktigat or naitik aacharnon par aadhaarit hoti he
 Fiqh is the terminology for Islamic jurisprudence, which is made up of the judgments of Islamic jurists
 islamic adhyayan kaa buniyadi ghatak, fiqh us paddati ko vistaar se batalaata he jiske jariye se islamic kanoon ko praathmik or madhyamik sroton se baahar nikaala gaya he
 The history of Islamic jurisprudence is "divided into eight periods by custom"
 mahatvata ke kram main fiqh ke strot hai: The Qur'an gives clear instructions on many issues such as how to perform purification rituals before compulsory daily prayers, but on other issues, some Muslims believe that the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear
 udhaaharan ke liye, koran ke anusaar— ramadan ke maheene ke dauraan, dainik prarthanaayen or upwas main sanlagn hone kii zarurat he lekin musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki in kartavyon kaa paalan karne ke tareeke ke bare main unhen or hidaayat kii aavashyaktaa he
 Explanations of these issues can be found in the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, so in most cases the arguments are the basis of the Quran and Sunnah
 islam ke praarambhik kaal main kuch vishay bina misaal ke hai un maamalon main, musalmaan nyayavid anya tareekon se nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Sunni jurists exercise the historical consensus of the community; In the modern era, most jurists also use analogy and comparison of the profit and loss of new subjects
 in atirikt upkarnon kii sahaayta se nishkarsh aane par sharia ke hisaab se kanoonon kii ek vyapak sarani banati he or ise fiqh kaha jaataa he
 Thus, in the face of the Shari'ah, Fiqh is not considered sacred, and there are disproportionate views on other aspects of the 'schools of thought process' without looking at them as sacred
 adhik vistrut muddon main vyakhya ke yah vibhaajan vichaar-prakriya ke vibhinn skulon main parinamswaroop mila he islamic nyaayashastra kii yah vyapak avadharana vibhinn vishyon main kai kanoonon kaa strot he jo rosemara kii jindagi main musalamaanon ko nirdeshit karata he
 The study of jurisprudence is called Fiqh or Fiqh by making the foundation of Shari'a policy
 fiqh ke maamle main islamic vidwaanon kii alag alag vyakhyaaon ke kaaran islam main nyaayashastra kai bhaagon main bat gaya or kai alag alag nyaayashastra se sambandhit vichaardhaaron kaa janm hua
 These are called religions
 sunni islam main pramukh mazahab hai: Most Muslims believe that all four religions are fundamentally correct, and the differences are in the nuanced interpretations of jurisprudence

 The intensity of the shaking is measured on the developed mercury scale
 prithvi kii sataha par, bukamp apane aap ko, bhoomi ko hilaakar yaa visthapit kar ke prakat karata he
 When a major earthquake occurs in the epicenter offshore, it causes a substantial amount of displacement at the seashore, which is the cause of the tsunami
 bukamp ke jatke kabhi-kabhi bhuskhalan or jwalamukhi gatividhiyon ko bhi paidaa kar sakate hai
 In the most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event, a natural event]) or an event caused by humans — which produce seismic waves)

 The starting point of earthquake is called center or hypo center
 shabd uparicendre kaa arth he, bhoomi ke str par thik iske upar kaa bindu
 In the case of, many earthquakes originate away from the plate boundary and are related to stresses developed over a wide area of deformation, this deformation is caused by major irregularities in the fault zone
 Northridge bukamp aise hi ek kshetra main andh dabaav gati se sambandhit tha
 Another example is the obliquely concentric plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plate where it passes through the northwestern part of the Zagros Mountains

 This is demonstrated by the central mechanism of earthquake
 sabhi tectonic plates main aantarik dabaav kshetra hote hai jo apni padosi platon ke saath antarkriya ke kaaran yaa talchhati ladaan yaa utraai ke kaaran hote hai
 
these stresses can be a sufficient cause of failure at the edge of present fault surfaces, these give rise to interplate earthquakes
 adhikansh tectonic bukamp 10 kilometre se adhik kii gaharaai se utpann nahin hote hai
 Earthquakes that occur at a depth of less than 70 kilometers are called 'shallow-center' earthquakes, while earthquakes occurring at depths between 70-300 kilometers are called 'mid-central' or 'inter-central' earthquakes
 
 nimnaskhalan kshetra main jahaan puraani or thandi samudri parat anya tectonic plate ke neeche khisak jaati he, gahare kendrit bukamp adhik gaharaai par aa sakate hai

 Most earthquakes occurring in a sequence can be related to each other in terms of location and time
 yadi aisa koi jhatka na aae jise spasht rup se mukhya jhatka kaha ja sake, to in jhatkon ke kram ko bukamp jhund kaha jaataa he
 Many times a series of earthquakes occur in the form of earthquake storms, where earthquakes cause group faults, redistribution of the stress of the former shock in each shock
 ye baad ke jatke ke samaan he lekin dosha kaa anugami bhaag he, ye toofaan kai varshon kii avadhi main utpann hote hai or kai baad main aane vaale bukamp utane hi kshatikaarak hote hai jitne ki pehle vaale

 As a result of the experiments of the Institute of Earth Sciences and Earthquake Resistant Construction of the Academy of Tajik Sciences, Russia, in relation to the prediction of earthquakes, it has recently been concluded that if the time of re-occurrence of earthquakes is recorded and in the same area as in the past If the time of earthquakes is known, then the year of the next more powerful earthquake can be determined

 AIDS is a kind of infectious disease that is a serious disease occurring from one to another and third to another
 The full name of AIDS is 'acquired Emulano Deficiency Syndrome' and it is spread by a type of virus called HIV
 If someone has HIV, it is not necessary that he also has AIDS
 AIDS is caused by HIV virus, if the virus is treated in time, then the risk of getting AIDS becomes work

 HIV also does not appear in the drug test for a long time

 Some of the initial symptoms of AIDS are: dhyaan rahe ki ye samast lakshan saadhaaran bukhaar yaa anya saamaanya rogon ke bhi ho sakate hai
 Therefore, AIDS can definitely be identified and should only be done through pharmacological examination
 echivi sankraman ke teen mukhya charan hai: teevr sankraman, naidanik vilambtaa evam aids
 The initial period of HIV that begins after its infection is called acute HIV or primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome
 In many individuals, influenza-like illness or monoucleosis in 2 to 4 weeks
 Symptoms begin to appear and some individuals do not have any such characteristic symptoms
 Symptoms of this disease start appearing in 40% to 90% of cases, with the most prominent symptoms being fever, large tender lymph nodes, swelling of the throat, palpitations, headaches or mouth and genital lesions
 Wheezing is seen in 20% -50% of cases
 In some people, opportunistic infection also develops at this stage
 kuch logon main jathrantra ki bimaariyaan jaise ulti, michali yaa dast or kuch main paridhiy neuropathy ke snaivik lakshan or jullan barre syndrome jaisi bimariyon ke lakshan dikhte hai
 The duration of symptoms is usually one or two weeks
 apane vishisht lakshan na dikhne ke kaaran log inhen aksar echivi kaa sankraman nahin maanate
 kai saamaanya sankramak rogon ke lakshan is beemaari main dikhne ke kaaran aksar doctor or hospital main bhi is beemaari kaa galat nidaan kar dete hai
 Therefore, if a patient has recurrent fever without any reason, then HIV test should be done because HIV or HIV
 Can be a symptom of infection
 is rog ke praarambhik lakshan ke agle charan ko naidanik vilambtaa, sparshonmukh echivi yaa puraani echivi kehete hai

 AIDS is defined in two ways, either when the number of CD4 + t cells is less than 200 cells per μl, or when a disease is caused in a person's body due to HIV infection
 In the absence of specific treatment, half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years
 The most common initial condition that indicates the presence of AIDS is pneumositis pneumonia, weakness such as weight loss, muscle cramps, fatigue, loss of appetite, etc
, and sofagel candidiasis

 With proper treatment, this risk can be reduced from 90% to 1% by reducing the infection from mother to child
 Infections of HIV from mother to child would be prevented by giving antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and delivery, by giving birth by elective surgery, not to breastfeed the newborn and also by giving doses of antiretroviral drugs to the newborn is
 However, many of these measures are still not available in developing countries

 Consistent use of condoms during sexual contact reduces the risk of HIV infection by approximately 80%
 When one of the pair's partner is infected with HIV, frequent use of condoms reduces the chance of HIV infection to the uninfected person by less than 1% per year
 There is also evidence of these things that the use of condom by women also provides protection similar to the use of condom for men
 According to a study, using a gel called Tenofovir on the vagina immediately before sex in African women reduced the risk of HIV infection by up to 40%
 Whereas spermicidal nonoxynol 9 in contrast increases the risk of infection because of its own tendency to increase vaginal and anal irritation
 Sunnah in sub-saharan Africa reduces the rate of HIV infection in heterosexual men by 38% –66% of cases by 24 months
 On the basis of these studies, in the year 2007, the World Health Organization and UNAID had described male circumcision as a way to prevent HIV infection from female to male
 Although this can prevent infection from male to female, it is controversial and whether male circumcision will work in developed countries or not and whether it will have any effect in gay men is still undetermined
 Some experts fear that a low perception of insecurity among circumcised men may promote sexual risk, which reduces its preventive effect
 Women who have had their female genitalia cut are at increased risk of developing HIV
 Programs showing sexual abstinence also do not appear to affect the increasing risk of HIV
 Massive sex education in school can reduce its prevalence

 HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicit Parallel Instruction Computing, which allows processors to execute multiple instructions every clock cycle
 ipiaisi bahut lambey nirdesh shabd vaastukala kaa ek rup lagu karata he, jisamen ek ekal nirdesh shabd main kai nirdesh hote hai
 According to HP, with EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor only executes the instructions and detailed to determine the instructions to execute in parallel

 HP believed that the development of microprocessors was not cost-effective for private enterprise systems companies such as HP itself, so partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, which was sourced from EPIC
 intel aaie-64 par ek bahut bada vikaas prayaas karne ke liye taiyaar tha, jiske parinamswaroop microprocesar kaa upyog bahusankhya udhyam pranaaliyon ke nirmaataaon dwaara kiya janaa tha
 HP and Intel began a major joint development effort in 1998 with the goal of delivering the first product, Merced

 "eyetanic" is often used by the Register, and others, indicating: a multibillion-dollar investment in Itenium - and the initial publicity associated with it - and its relatively quick collapse
 june 2001 main itanium jari kiye jane tak, iskaa pradarshan pratispardhi aaraiessi or siaiessi procesar se behatar nahin tha
 Itenium competed on the low end with servers based on x86 processors, and on the high end with ibm's Power Architecture and Sun Microsystems' SPARC Architecture
 intel ne ucch ant vyapaar or echpisi computing par dhyaan kendrit karne ke liye itanium ko doharaaya, x86 ke safal "kshaitij" bazaar ko dupliket karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The success of this early processor version was limited to replacing PA-RISC in HP systems, Alpha in Compaq systems, and MIPS in SGI systems, although IBM also provided a supercomputer based on this processor

 It is originally thought to be divided into two sub-systems: the parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system
]] More recently, the third subsystem of neurons came to light, which is named 'non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic'
 , Neurones that were found to be fully integrated into autonomous functions and were similarly interpreted, they were used especially in the intestines
 And was found in the lungs
 prakaarya ke sambandh main, eenes ko aamtaur par samvedi or motor main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 Under the system, among these nuns, there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses
 tantrika tantra pranali kabhi kabhi swytt tantrika tantra kaa hissaa mana jaataa he autonomik, or kabhi kabhi ek swatantra pranali mana jaataa he
 The ANS is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and the anesthesia nervous system system
 tantrika tantra or parasympathetic sahanubhuti prabhag thoracolumbar "bahirvah" he, jiskaa arth he ki neurons ridh kii haddi ke vaksh or kaath bhaag main shuru
 parasympathetic prabhag crinioscrail "bahirvah" he, jiskaa arth he ki neurons kapaly tantrikaon par shuru or trik ridh kii haddi
 The ANS is specific in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway, the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ
 The reganglionic, or first neuron, will begin at the "outflow" and will synapse at the postganglionic, or second, neuron's cell body
 The post ganglionic neuron will then synapse on the target organ
 sahanubhuti prabhag L2 se T1 rassi sharir main cell hote hai parshv sing kii ridh kii haddiridh kii haddi) ke intermediolateral hai or pregnglionic neurons rahe hai
 There are several places in which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons: in gangliya postganglionic neurons se jo lakshya angon kii innervation prakaar pradaan karte hai
 Examples of pet-related veins are: in sabhi abhivahi ke rup main acchhee tarah se tantrikaon, bhi gavaa neurons ke rup main janaa hote hai
 Parasympathetic division involves cell clusters of one of two places: the brainstem or sacral spinal cord
 These are preganglionic neutrons that combine with postganglionic neutrons at these locations: ye ganglia postaganglionic neutron utpann karte hai jinase niyat angon kaa aachhadan ho jaataa he
 Examples of this are: ganitulate chaati or nodose gangliya, kapaal nason VII IX or eks in samvedi ko kramash sanlagn: samvedi haath "praathmik aant kaa samvedi neurons" paridhiy tantrika tantra main paaya "kapaal samvedi gangliya " main, se bana he neurons carbon dioxide or rakt, dhamniyon ke dabaav or pet or pet saamagree kii rasinic sanrachana main oxigen chini ke str kii nigaraanee

 The primary "second order" sensory neurons or project relay neurons, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract, located in the visceral sensory medulla oblongata that integrate all visceral information
 The NTS also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the region posterema, that detects toxins in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and chemically induces vomiting or conditional taste
 All these visceral sensory information continuously and unconsciously modulate the movements of the motor neurons of the anus anas kii motor neurons bhi pien ke gangliya main sthit hai, "autonomik gangliya " kaha jaataa he
 They belong to three categories with different effects on their target organs: sympathetic, parasympathetic and intestinal
 prevertebral or purv mahadhamani shrinkhalaa: sahanubhuti gangliya do sahanubhuti zanjeeron main paas ridh kii haddi main sthit hai
 Parasympathetic ganglia, in contrast, the organs are located in the target for close proximity: the submandibular ganglion glands to close the saliva, etc
 to close the percutaneous heart ganglia 

 intestinal ganglia, which come in the digestive tube as their name Means are located within its walls and collectively form the complete spinal cord as local sensory neurons, motor neurons and these
 Ernurons are as many neurons, including
 yah keval anas kaa sahi myne main swytt hissaa he or pachan ascharyajanak rup se algaav main acchhee tarah se kar sakate hai samaaroh bhi tub he
 The reason is that the enteric nervous system has been called "the second brain"

 uttrakhand main east india company kaa aagaman 1815 main hua
 Earlier the Nepali Gorkhas were ruled here
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki gorkha shaskaon dwaara is ilaake ke logon par kiye gayi atyaacharon ko dekhakar hi angrejon kaa dhyaan is ore gaya
 However, there were other reasons for the Gurkha war fought between the British and Nepalese Gurkhas
 almoda main 27 april 1815 ko gorkha pratinidhi bamshaah or leftinent karnal gardenar ke bich hui ek sandhi ke baad nepali shaasha ne is kshetra se hat jane ko sweekaara or is kshetra par east india company kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 After the Treaty of Sugauli on 4 April 1816, the British had full authority over this area and the border of Nepal was declared as Kali River
 angrejon ne puure ilaake ko apane shashan main na rakh april 1815 main hi gadhwal ke purvi hisse or kumayun ke kshetra par apana adhikaar rakhaa or pashchimi hissaa sudarshan shah, jo gorakhon ke shashan se pehle gadhwal ke raja the, ko saunp diya jo alaknanda or mandakini nadiyon ke pashchim main padataa tha
 Thus Garhwal was divided into two parts, the eastern part which became part of British India with Kumaon called "british Garhwal" and the western part came to be called Tehri Garhwal after its capital Tehri under the rule of King Sudarshan Shah
 tehri ko raja sudarshan shah dwaara nayi rajdhani banaaya gaya tha kyonki puraani rajdhani srinagar ab british gadhwal main aati thi
 British Garhwal later came to be known as pauri-garhwal after the appointment of assistant-commissioner in Pauri here in 1840, whereas earlier it came under the Kumaon Commissionary at Nainital
 duusari ore kumaun kshetra ke puraane shaasha chand raja ko yah adhikaar nahin mila or yah british bharat kaa hissaa ban gaya or british cheef-kamishanships ke antargat shasit hone laga jisaki rajdhani nainital main sthit thi
 Tehri Rajwada and under British rule till the independence of India, this area was merged into the state of Uttar Pradesh after independence
 1856 se 1884 tak paudi-gadhwal or kumaun kshetra henry raimaje ke shashan main rahaa tathaa yah yug british satta ke shaktishaalee hone ke kaal ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya

 Although some scholars believe that Kalu Mehra and his siblings were in contact with the rebels of Awadh, they secretly met both the British and the rebels of Awadh, intending to accompany him to victory

 pandavon ko matsay naresh viraat kii rajdhani main nivas karte huye das maah vyateet ho gayi
 Suddenly one day, King Virat's brother-in-law Keechaka came to meet his sister Sudeshna
 jab uski drushti sairandhri par padi to vah kaam-peedit ho uthaa tathaa sairandhri se ekaant main milane ke avasar kii taak main rahane laga
 Draupadi also sensed his erotic attitude
 draupadi ne maharaj viraat evam maharani sudeshna se kaha bhi ki kichak mujh par kudrushti rakhata he, mere paanch gandharv pati hai, ek na ek din ve kichak kaa vadh denge
 But both of them did not care about Draupadi
 laachaar hokar ek din draupadi ne bhimsen ko kichak kii kudrushti tathaa kuvichaar ke vishay main bataa diya
 Hearing Draupadi's words, Bhimsen said, "O Draupadi! You give the message to that evil witch-hunter to get the dance hall at midnight
 nrityshala main tumhaare sthaan par main jaakar uskaa vadh kar doongaa
 "sairandhri indicated that Keechak would meet at the dance hall at night as per Ballabh's plan
 draupadi ke is sanket se prasann kichak jab raatri ko nrityshala main pahunchaa to vahaan par bhimsen draupadi kii ek sari se apana sharir or munh dhank kar vahaan lete huye the
 Considering them as Syndri, the sarcastic one said, "oh dear! i owe everything to you ab tum utho or mere saath raman karo
 On hearing the words of Keechaka, Bhimsen jumped up and stood up and said, "oh sinner! You are not Sairandhri, standing before your death
 le ab parastri par kudrushti daalane kaa fal chakh
 By saying this, Bhimsen started kicking Keechaka with a kick and a punch
 jis prakaar prachand aandhi vrikshon ko jhakzor daalati he usee prakaar bhimsen kichak ko dhakke maar-maar kar sari nrityshala main ghumaane lage
 After hitting him on the earth several times, by twisting his neck with his arms, he killed the animal's death
 is prakaar kichak kaa vadh kar dene ke baad bhimsen ne uske sabhi angon ko tod-marod kar use maans kaa ek londa bana diya or draupadi se bole, “panchali! aakar dekho, maine is kaam ke keede kii kya durgati kar di he
 Draupadi got a lot of satisfaction after seeing that degradation
 phir ballab or sairandhri chupchaap apane-apane sthanon main jaakar so gayi
 In the morning when news of Keechak's slaughter was received by everyone, then Queen Sudeshna, King Virat, Keechak's other brothers etc
 started mourning
 jab kichak ke shav ko antyeshti ke liye le jaaya jane laga to draupadi ne raja viraat se se kaha, “ise mujh par kudrushti rakhane kaa fal mil gaya, avashya hi mere gandharv patiyon ne isaki yah durdasha kii he
 Hearing the words of Draupadi, the brothers of Keechaka got angry and said, "our very strong brother has died due to this Sirendri, so it should be burnt with the funeral pyre
 ” itnaa kahkar unhone draupadi ko jabardastee kichak kii arthi ke saath band ke or shmashaan kii ore le jane lage
 This plight of Draupadi was not seen by the Pandavas present there as Kank, Ballabh, Vrihannala, Tantipala and Granthik but they could not even reveal themselves due to the unknown
 isaliye bhimsen chupake se parcote ko laanghakar shmashaan kii ore daud pade or raste main keechad tathaa mitti kaa saare angon par lep kar liya
 Then uprooted a huge tree and broke it on the brothers of Keechaka
 unamem se kitnon ko hi bhimsen ne maar daalaa, jo shesh bache ve apana praan bachaakar bhaag nikle
 After this, Bhimsen consoled Draupadi and sent her to the palace and after bathing herself returned to her place by another route
 kichak tathaa uske bhaaiyon kaa vadh hote dekhakar maharaj viraat sahit sabhi log draupadi se bhaybheet rahane lage
 The news of Keechak's slaughter spread like a storm
 vastav main kichak bada parakramee tha or usase trigart ke raja susharma tathaa hastinapur ke kaurav aadi darate the
 On the death of Keechak, King Susharma and the Kauravagas formed a large army for the purpose of invading the city of Virat
 kauravon ne susharma ko pehle chadhaai karne kii salaah di
 According to his advice, Susarma, following his advice, attacked the city of Virat and grabbed all the cows of that state
 isse rajya ke sabhi gwaalon ne raaj sabha main jaakar guhaar lagaai, “he maharaj! trigart ke raja susharma hamase sab gauon ko chhinakar apane rajya main liye ja rahe hai
 You should protect us soon
 ”us samay sabha main viraat or kank aadi sabhi upasthit the
 King Virat decided that the army under Kank, Ballabh, Tantipal, Granthik and his own leadership be put into battle
 unki is yojana ke anusaar sabane milakar raja susharma ke upar dhaava bol diya
 Seeing the valor of the pandemic Pandavas, Susarma's soldiers started fleeing with their lives
 susharma ke bahut utsaah dilaane par bhi ve sainik waapas aakar yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 Seeing the dismantling of his army, King Susarma also started running but the Pandavas surrounded him
 ballab ne laat ghunson se maar-maar kar uski haddi pasli tod daalaa
 After overhauling Susharma, Ballabh picked him up and threw him to the earth
 bhoomi par gir kar vah jor-jor chillane laga
 Bhimsen did not listen to him and tied him up and presented it to Yudhishthira
 susharma ke dwaara daasatv sweekaar karne par dharmraj yudhisthir ne use chhod diya
 From the other side, the Kauravas attacked the city of Virat
 praja raaj sabha main aakar raksha ke liye guhaar lagane lagi kintu us samay to maharaj chaaron pandavon ke saath susharma se yuddh karne chale gayi the
 There were only princes north in the palace
 praja ko raksha ke liye guhaar lagaate dekh kar sairandhri se rahaa na gaya or unhone rajkumaar uttar ko kauravon se yuddh karne ke liye na jate huye dekhakar khub fatkaaraa
 Hearing Sairandri's rebuke, Prince North boasted, "I must have defeated the Kauravas by going to war, but i am unable to, because i have no charioteer
" ” uski baat sunakar sairandhri ne kaha, “rajkumaar! vrihannalaa bahut nipun sarathi he or vah kuntiputra arjuna kaa sarathi rah chuki he
 Make him your charioteer and go to war
 ”antatah rajkumaar uttar vrihannalaa ko sarathi banaakar yuddh ke liye niklaa
 On that day, the time of Pandavas' exile had ended and the time for their appearance had come
 urvashi ke shaapvash mili arjuna kii napunsakata bhi khatm ho chuki thi
 So on the way Arjuna stopped the chariot near the crematorium where the Pandavas hid their weapons and took their weapons secretly
 jab unka rath yubhumi main pahunchaa to kauravon kii vishaal sena or bhishma, dron, karn, ashwatthama, duryodhana aadi parakramee yoddhaon ko dekhakar rajkumaar uttar atyant ghabara gaya or bolaa, “vrihannalaa! tum rath waapas le chalo
 i cannot compete with these warriors
 ” vrihannalaa ne kaha, “he rajkumaar! kisi bhi kshatriyaputra ke liye yuddh main peeth dikhaane se to acha he ki vah yuddh main veergati praapt kar le
 Pick up your weapons and do battle
 ”kintu rajkumaar uttar par vrihannalaa ke vachanon kaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa or vah rath se kud kar bhaagane laga
 At this, Arjun caught him and said, "prince! There is no need to be afraid
 mere hote huye tumhaara koi bhi kuch nahin bigaad saktaa
 Today i am revealing myself to you, i am Panduputra Arjuna and Kanka Yudhishthira, Ballabh Bhimsen, Tantipal Nakula and Granthik Sahadeva
 ab main inase yuddh karunga, tum ab is rath kii bagdor sanbhaalo
 Hearing this promise, Prince Uttar gripped and grabbed Arjuna's leg
 ke devdatt shankh kii dhwani ranbhumi main goonj uthi
 Hearing that distinctive sound, Duryodhana said to Bhishma, "pitamah! This is the sound of Arjuna's Devdutt conch, yet the Pandavas' unknown domination has not ended
 arjuna ne swayan ko prakat kar diya isaliye ab pandavon ko punah baarah varsh kaa vanvaas or ek varsh kaa agyatavaas bhogana hoga
 Hearing the words of Duryodhana, Bhishma Pitamah said, "duryodhana! Perhaps you do not know that Pandavas are aware of the movement of time, Arjuna can never come out without completing the period
 maine bhi gananaa kar liya he ki pandavon ke agyatavaas kii avadhi purna ho chuki he
 Duryodhana, leaving a long assurance, said, "now that Arjuna is sure to come, father! We should create an array soon
 ” is par bhishma ne kaha, “vatsa! tum ek tihaai sena lekar gauon ke saath vidaa ho jaao
 We will fight Arjuna here with the rest of the army
 ” bhishma pitamah ke paraamarsh ke anusaar duryodhana gauon ko lekar ek tihaai sena ke saath hastinapur kii ore chal padaa
 Seeing that Duryodhana was returning from the battlefield, Arjuna ran his chariot behind Duryodhana and surrounded Duryodhana on the way and distracted him with his numerous arrows
 arjuna ke baanon se duryodhana ke sainikon ke pair ukhd gayi or ve peeth dikhaa kar bhaag gayi
 All the cows also rushed to Virat Nagar and escaped
 duryodhana ko arjuna ke baanon se ghira dekhakar karn, dron, bhishma aadi sabhi vir uski raksha ke liy daud pade
 Seeing Karna in front, Arjuna's anger was no longer open
 unhone karn par itane baan barasaaye ki uske rath, ghode, sarathi sabhi nasht bhrasht ho gayi or karn bhi maidan chhod kar bhaag gaya
 After Karna left, Bhishma and Drona started dropping arrows at Arjuna together, but Arjun cut his arrows in pieces with his arrows in between
 antatah arjuna ke baanon se vyakul hokar saare kaurav maidan chhod kar bhaag gayi
 When the Kauravas fled in this way, Arjuna also returned to Virat Nagar playing Vijay Shankh
