 This is why Mahadev Desai joined Bapu and his movements and breathed his last breath of life in the Aga Khan Palace on August 15, 1942, serving the nation throughout his life
 mahadev desai ne baapu ke nijee sachiv ke taur par kaary karte hue apni diary main bharat ke swatantraaa aandolan kaa jo jivant varnan kiya he, vah adbhut hai
 He was an important soldier of the Indian independence movement

 Mahadev Desai is tall, thirty-one thirty-one years old
 unke chehre ke naksh durust hai or hoth patale hai ; ankhen aisi hai ki ve kisi rahasyamayi dipti se chamakati rahati hai
 Despite this mysterious glance, he is a man of very systematic work
 agar ve vyavasthit na hon to itnaa sab kaam kar hi nahin sakate
 Although his nature is fast, emotional; Yet they have restraint on their lusts
 mahatmaji ke prati jo shraddha -bhakthi unhen he, vah dharmik he ; solah varshon se ve gandhi ke saath rahe hai, unase ekatm hokar

 Wind velocity is a fundamental atmospheric amount

 The atmospheric pressure at different places is different, which is due to the difference in temperature

 Any device which is used to injure, tame, or kill an enemy is called weapon or armament
 shastr kaa prayog akraman karne, bachaav karne athwa daraane-dhamkaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Weapons can be as simple as sticks, on the other hand as complicated as ballistic missiles
 aayudh un yantron ko kehete hai jinka prayog yuddh main hota he
 Thus all the instruments from arrows, swords to big guns are armaments
 aayudh ke vikaas kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna maanav jati ke vikaas kaa
 Human life has been struggling from time to time
 jeevanaraksha ke liye use bhayanak or shaktishaalee jeevajantuon se ladanaa padaa hoga

 Along with the development and increasing power of armaments, devices of immunity were needed and invented
 sambhavat: charm ko lakdi ke dandon main phasaakar dhaal banane kii kala bahut puraani hogi
 Over the years, armor and in the modern era, armor was invented
 yah dekha gaya he ki manushya ne jab-jab sanhaar ke sadhano kaa nirmaan kiya, uske saath-saath pratiraksha ke sadhano kaa bhi vikaas hua
 Ordnances are generally classified based on their use, method and characteristics
 inke anusaar pashanyug se barood ke avishkaar tak ke ayudhon kaa vargeekaran is prakaar he : Weapons are weapons that are not thrown
 inke upvargeekaran ke antargat nimnlikhit shastr hai : Cutting weapons; Such as sword, sword etc
 bhonkanevaale shastr, jaise barchaa, trishul aadi; Blunt arms, such as mace
 astr ve hathiyaar hai jo phenke jate hai
 These weapons are included under: puratatvvettaon ke matanusaar samay ke saath-saath manushya kaa gyaan badha or vah soch samajhakar icchaanusaar pathar or lakdi ke shastr banane laga
 Then we started making these weapons by making them flat, shapely, sharp and shiny

 By mixing copper and tin he went to make bronze and then gradually the stone weapons were replaced by bronze weapons
 is kaal ke shastron main visheshat: dhanushbaan, barchhi, churi, bhaalaa, kulhada or gada ke tathaa rakshaatmak sadhano main keval kaanse kii dhaal ke pramaan mili hai
 The place of bronze is usually 1000 BC i took iron vaidic kaal main astrashastron kaa vargeekaran is prakaar tha : Amukta - Weapons that were not thrown
 mukta - ve shastr jo phenke jate the
 They also had two types - muktamukt - vah shastr jo phenkakar yaa bina phenke donon prakaar se prayog kiye jate the
 Liberated Retirement - Weapons that could be thrown and returned
 aagneyastra kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he, par adhik spasht nahin
 There are many ways to classify weapons
 kuch vidwaanon ne hathiyaaron ke nimnlikhit 3 lakshan bataaye hai- The famous military thinker JFC Fuller has said that weapons have the following characteristics: uparokt gunon ke saath-saath uttam hathiyaaron main nimnlikhit gunon kaa hona bhi atyant aavashyak hota he- Protection of various body parts has been noted
 udaahranarth sharir ke liye charm tathaa kavach kaa, sir ke liye shiristraan or gale ke liye kanthatran ityadi kaa
 Similar weapons were also manufactured in Europe
 12veen sadi kaa kavach lohe kii choti-choti kadiyon ko goonthkar banataa tha
 Zirhabkhtar was beautiful and convenient, but could not fully protect it from heavy weapon injuries
 isliye 13veen sadi i

 The same armor was also made for the rear horse
 jalika bhi ashv tathaa manushya donon ke liye banati thi
 The armor of the rider and horsemen ranged from 200 to 300 pounds
 13veen shatabdi main shastron kii shakti main bhi unnati hui
 The long bow of the British was so powerful that the arrow made from it pierced ordinary armor
 yah dhanush chah foot lanbaa hota tha or iskaa chah foot kaa baan 250 gaj tak sugamawa se maar kar saktaa tha
 Similarly, there was the 'halberd ax' of Switzerland
 iskaa dasta aath foot kaa tha or kulhaade ke saath-saath isamen barchhi or savaar ko khinchakar giraane ke kaam kaa ek tedha kaanta bhi hota tha
 a skilled fighter could also cut good armor from its injury
 barood ke avishkaar ne manushya ke haath main ek aisi shakti de di jisane yuddh kii ruparekha hi badal di
 It is certain that firearms were manufactured in the early 14th century
 pratham aagneyastra top thi
 It is mainly made of two types - one is short nalwali and the other is long drain
 ye topein pehle taanbe or kaanse kii baniin or phir lohe kii banane lageen
 In the 15th century, the cannons were 30 inches in circumference and fired stone shells weighing between 1,200 and 1,500 pounds
 aadhunik havitzar or baari fildgan moreter or bambard ke hi viksit rup hai
 By the end of this century small hand guns were made

 anya mahatvapurn shastron kaa bhi avishkaar 14veen se 16veen shatabdi main hua, jaise haath kaa bam, kaanse ke visphotak gole, pistaul, daahak gole, ityadi
 Arms were more developed in modern times
 16veen shatabdi tak aagneyastra itane prabhaavshaalee ban chuke the ki manushya ke swarakshatmak kavach vyarth the
 The man of 1915 remained helpless in front of firearms, but the first armor was built this year
 manushya ab ispaat kii moti-moti chaadaron se bani is gaadi main baithkar halke aagneyastra ke prahaar se batch saktaa tha
 The principle of working of gun, rifle and cannon is the same
 kisi teen ore dridhtaa se band paatr main barood rakhi jaati he or iske baad chharra, goli yaa gola rakhkar chauthi ore se paatr ko asthaayee rup se band kar diya jaataa he
 The gunpowder is then set on fire with a device
 tab barood turant jalakar gaison main parivartit ho jaati he
 These gases are highly compressed due to being generated in very less space
 isliye chharen, goli yaa gole ko ve bahut balpurvak dabaati hai
 As long as the sphere moves in the placenta of the device, it keeps pressing on it and its velocity keeps increasing
 is prakaar usamen bahut adhik veg utpann ho jaataa he
 Due to the placenta, its direction is also determined; Therefore, by moving the placenta, the sphere can be hit at the target at will
 san 1313 i
 se europe main top ke prayog kaa pakkaa pramaan miltaa he
 In India, Babur first used cannons in the battle of Panipat
 pehle topein kaanse kii banati thim or unako dhaala jaataa tha
 But such guns were not sufficiently athletic
 unamem adhik barood daalane se ve fat jaati thim
 To overcome this flaw, iron rings were heated and put on them very tightly
 thandha hone par aise challe sikudakar badi dridhtaa se bhitari naal ko dabaae rahete hai, thik usee prakaar jaise baiylgaadee ke pahie ke upar chadhi haal pahie ko dabaae rahati he
 For greater confirmation, the rods were also placed along the length of the rod along each other before mounting the rings
 is samay kii ek prasiddh top mons meg he, jo ab edinbura ke durg par shobhaa ke liye rakhi he
 After this, there was no significant advance in cannon making for about 200 years
 is yug main naalon kaa sanchhidr chikna hota tha
 But in about 1520 a German cannon maker started making spiral grooves in the fringes
 is top main golakaar gole ke badale lambotar "gole" prayukt hote the
 Due to the spiral grooves in the compound, the projecting body starts dancing with velocity
 is prakaar naachata pind vaayu ke pratirodh se bahut kam vichlit hota he or parinamswaroop lakshya par adhik sachai se padataa he
 In 1855, Lord Armstrong built a wrought iron cannon, in which all this material was removed by removing the lid from the back, instead of loading ammo from the mouth like earlier cannons
 isamen 40 pound ke prakshipt bhare jate the
 In ordinary cannons, the projectile comes out at great speed and the cannon can not be moved in a very high direction
 duusari ore choti naal kii topein halki banati hai or unase nikle prakshipt main bahut veg nahin hota, parantu inamen yah gun hota he ki prakshipt bahut upar uthakar neeche girtaa he or isliye isse diwaar, pahari aadi ke peeche chhipe shatru ko bhi maar sakate hai
 These are called mortars

 As the cannon making progressed, so too did the advancements in the making of mortars and howitzers
 praaia: sabhi deshon main ek hi prakaar se topon ke nirmaan main unnati hui, kyonki baraabar hode lagi rahati thi
 When one country makes more heavy, more powerful or more quick-fire cannons, the matter is not hidden for many days and the rival countries would have tried to make even better guns
 1898 i
 main fransavaalon ne ek aisi top banaai jo uske baad bananevaali topon kii pathpradarshak hui
 The velocity of the projectile was higher than that; His attribution was commendable; The firing was completely stable, because in the implantation there were grains which did not allow the cannon to move in any direction by getting stuck in the ground
 sabhi topein daagne par peeche hatati hai
 Fluids were used to reduce the velocity of this attack
 iske prakshipt patali diwaar ke banaae the
 Each of these weights was about 12 pounds and contained about three and a half pounds of high explosive ammo
 prakshipt main vishesh rasayanon se yukt ek topi bhi rahati thi, jisase lakshya par pahunchakar prakshipt fat jaataa tha or tukade bade veg se idhar-udhar shatru ko dur tak ghayal karte the
 It can also kill soldiers hiding behind a wall
 pratham vishwayuddh main germanon ne 'big bartha' naamak top banaai, jisase unhone paris par 75 mile kii duuri se gole barsaanaa aarambh kiya
 There was no new theory in this cannon
 top keval paryaapt badi or pusht thi
 But with the invention of airplanes and other new instruments such guns have now become endangered

 The weight of each head was 29 pounds
 daagne par prayek agnibaan 3,900 se 8,000 gaj tak ja saktaa tha
 Each electrical switch was fired
 in swichon ko yaa to is prakaar vyavasthit kiya ja saktaa tha ki agnibaan aadh-aadh second par apane aap chhutate rahen yaa icchaanusaar kai agnibaan yaa kul agnibaan ek saath hi chhuten
 This sudden blast of high explosive caused heavy damage to the enemy's army and made him extremely afraid
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke ant main germany ne bina maanvi sanchaalak ke or bahut dur tak pahunchnewale agnibaan banaae, jinka naam ve-es or ve-do padaa
 Visually the V-1 was like an aircraft
 isamen 130 galen petrol aata tha or mashin kaa bhaar lagbhag ek ton rahata tha
 Its velocity used to be 350 miles per hour while flying and it produced terrible sounds while walking
 saath main ve-do kaa chitra dikhaaya gaya he
 Alcohol and liquid oxygen were used in this
 prayek baan main lagbhag teen ton alcohol or paanch ton drav oxygen bharaa rahata tha
 Its maximum velocity was about 3,000 miles per hour
 yantra kii akruti cigar kii tarah hoti thi or bina eendhan bhaar lagbhag ek ton
 Airplanes move at such a speed that it was difficult to shoot them with a cannon, but American scientists added such a connection between radars and airborne cannons that the cannon itself was fixed on the aircraft
 san 1944 ke udan bamon par vijay isi se mili, kyonki ye radarayukt topein lagbhag 70 pratishat aise bamon ko maar giraati thim
 There are many types of these
 kuch pramukh bam jo aajkal ke yuddh main prayukt kiye jate hai, nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Fissile bomb 2
 Destroyer bomb 3
 Agnibus 4
 Chemical bomb 5
 Bacterial bomb 6
 Radiation bomb vikhandak bam - isamen vishesh prakaar ke dhaatu ke khokhale paatr ke bheetar visphotak padaarth bharaa hota he
 When it hits the earth when it falls from an aircraft or rocket, it explodes with a bang and injures people by its pieces
 kabhi-kabhi yah vayuyan se giraane par prithvi se kuch oonchaai par hawa main hi foot jaataa he
 The total weight of these bombs is 2 kg
 Ranging from 50 kg Happens till
 saadharantaya ye bam bade kshetron main giraae jate hai
 Destroyer Bomb - Its weight is 50 kg
 Ranging from 1,000 kg Happens till
 isamen saadhaaran visphotak bharaa rahata he
 Fire bombs - These are dropped on densely populated cities and large factories, from which they are destroyed by burning
 isamen aag lagaanevaala padaarth ek vishesh prakaar ke prajwalak palite ke saath bharaa hota he
 Chemical compounds such as phosphorus, nepam and thermite electrons are used to set fire and then their names are also given according to the substance used
 'rasinic bam - yah ek prakaar kaa baloon hota he jisaki diwaar patali hoti he
 It is filled with poisonous things
 yah bam jameen athwa jameen se kuch upar hawa main visphot karata he to vifailli vastuen, gas, taral yaa thos jo bhi hoti hai, khol se baahar nikalakar jameen athwa hawa main bikhar jaati hai or kuch hi kshanon main us visphot sthal ke aasapaas badal kaa rup dhaaran kar leti hai
 Bacterial bomb - Its weight is about 75 kg
 Happens till
 isamen kai kaksh hote hai
 Each chamber is filled with bacteria, diseased insects or lice
 bam giraane par isamen laga fus jal uthta he or isi samay iske kakshon kaa dhakkn, jo kabjedaar hota he, jatke ke saath khul jaataa he or rog failaanevaale jeevanu hawa main bikharakar fail jate hai
 If the shell of this bomb opens 30 feet from the ground, then these bacteria spread about 400 square meters
 jis kshetra main jeevanu bam giraae jate hai usamen manushya, jeev jantu or ped paudhe aadi sabhi rog ke shikaar ho sakate hai kyonki sara vaataavaran dooshit ho jaataa he
 Radiation bomb - It is like a chemical bomb but its shell is somewhat thin
 iske bheetar radiumdharmi padaarth visphotak padaarth ke saath bharaa hota he
 After the explosion, these substances get mixed up in the air like dust, due to which the air there is contaminated with radium
 is prakaar vahaan ke log radiumdharmi vikiranjanya rogon se grast ho jate hai
 They have proved more terrible than atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs
 ye aise astr hai jinhen chhodane par kisi prakaar kaa dhamaakaa nahin hota he
 Bacterial weapons contain disease-causing bacteria and the war in which they are used is very dangerous and destructive
 pratham vishwayuddh main yubhumi main 51,259 amareeki sainik mare the, par uske baad jeevanuon se faili beemaari se maranevaalon kii sankhya 51,447 thi
 In ancient times people used to put the dead body of the patient in the circle of enemies so that their death could be caused by bacteria
 ye yuddh main astron ke rup main prayukt kiye jate hai or kai prakaar ke hote hai
 They spread infectious diseases to humans, animals and plants
 inkaa prayog dushman kii yuddh karne kii kshamta ghataane ke liye hota he
 These bacteria infect millions of soldiers in a very short time on getting the proper environment
 yuddhastra ke rup main naanaa prakaar ke jeevanu prayog main laae jate hai or prayek prakaar ke jeevanu alag-alag prakaar ke sankramak rog failaate hai
 Among the various tools that are possible to use for disease-causing bacteria are some of the following: ek baar chhod die jane par ye sookshmjivi hawa main bikhar jate hai or vaayu ke saath-saath hajaaron mile ke kshetra main fail jate hai
 For example, if Basilai is released by aerosol at a distance of 240 km from the beach, it will automatically spread over an area of 1,30,800 square km
 is prakaar us bhubhag main ye jeevanu rog failaate hai
 It has been found that the number of soldiers who die due to infection with these microbes is more than the soldiers who die from the attack of weapons
 jeevanuon ke prajnan kii jo aseem kshamta he vah jeevanu astron ko or adhik ghaatak bana detii he
 If these bacteria go once, then it is not easy to destroy them
 in jeevanuon kaa koi vishesh rang, swaad or gandh nahin hota
 Due to these characteristics, the importance of bacterial weapons is increasing day by day

 Sarada Devi is seen as the first disciple of Sri Ramakrishna
 apane dhyaan main die samay ke alaava ve baaki samay ramakrishna or bhakton ke liye bhojan banane main vyateet karti thim
 After Ramakrishna's death in 1886, Sarada Devi went to visit the shrine
 vahaan se lautne ke baad ve kamarpukur main rahane aa gayin
 But due to lack of proper arrangements there, she left Kamarpukur and moved to Calcutta at the very request of the devotees
 kalakatta aane ke baad sabhi bhakton ke bich sangh mata ke rup main pratishthit hokar unaaone sabhi ko maan rup main sangrakshan evam abhaya pradaan kiya
 He gave initiation to many devotees and paved them in the spiritual path

 1830 main, dachon ne unhen macessar ko nirvasit kar diya tha
 Prafulla Kumar Mohanty is a noted litterateur of Odia language
 inke dwaara rachit ek samalochna bhartiya samskruti o bhagavadgita ke liye unhen san 2004 main sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Dynamite is an explosive chemical mixture
 ise gan powder yaa apane kaale rang ke kaaran kaala powder bhi kehete hai
 Gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur, coal and salt and was the first explosive produced in human history
 barood kaa prayog pataakhon evam nodak ke rup main agnishastron main kiya jaataa he
 The ammo burns fast after getting a spark, which produces a large amount of gas and hot solids
 aadhunik kaal main barood ek "kamjor visphotak" ke rup main janaa jaataa he kyonki visphot hone par yah apshravya tarangen paidaa karata he na ki parashravya tarangen 
 Therefore, the gases produced by the burning of gunpowder produce the same pressure which helps in throwing the bullet forward but does not damage the shotgun
 kisi chattan ke vidhwans yaa kisi kile ko todne ke liye barood kaa prayog upyukt nahin hota balki inke liye "tii en tii" aadi achche rahete hai
 At present, the standard mixture of gunpowder contains 75% nitre, 15% soft charcoal and 10% sulfur
 iskaa avishkaar kab hua, iskaa thik thik pataa nahin lagata, par aisa maaloom hota he ki isa ke purv kaal main chiniyon ko barood kii jaankaree thi
 The gunpowder Bacon's articles mention gunpowder, but he did not seem to know the propellant properties of gunpowder
 By the time of Bacon, shora, an essential ingredient of gunpowder, was not attainable in pure form
 13veen shatabdi ke uttarardh ke shastron main prakshepya phenkane main iske prayog kaa pataa lagata he
 In the gunpowder Bacon mentions, Shora lived in 41
2 and coal and sulfur 29
4 percent each
 aise barood kii prabalata nikrusht koti kii hoti thi
 Later, the ratio of gunpowder to nitrate, coal and sulfur was reduced to 74
64, 13
51 and 11
85 percent respectively
 barood main in teenon avyavon kaa churna rahata he
 This powder was initially made by grinding by hand, but later the pulverizing machine started to be used
 ye mashine ghodon yaa pani se chalati thim
 Stamping machines began to be used in their place later, but it was not safe
 pehle jo churna banate the ve teenon avyavon ke churnon ko milakar banate the
 Such shreds could neither be tightened very much in the cannons nor could be left loose
 is kathinata ko dur karne ke liye 15veen shatabdi main chure ko daanedaar rup main praapt karne kaa praytn hua
 Alcohol was mixed with alcohol, or urine, in a shred
 madhsevi kaa mutr iske liye sarvshereshth samajha jaataa tha
 The grains made from it were more powerful
 dane vibhinn aakaar ke hote the or chaalkar unhen alag alag kiya jaataa tha
 Larger grains were used in cannons and smaller grains used in guns
 peeche avyavon ko shuddh rup main praapt kar unase barood banane main or unhen daanedaar banane main vishesh sudhaar hua
 Good coal was also being formed now
 use bhura yaa cocao koyala kehete the or yah rai naamak anaaj ke puaal se banaaya jaataa tha
 But Etadarth did not take full care of the straw
 saamaanya barood main avyavon kaa anupaat nimnlikhit rakhte the
 Nitrate 75 percent, coal 15 percent and sulfur 10 percent
 nae mishran main inaki aapekshik maatra kramash: 80, 16, 3 rahati thi tathaa ek bhaag jal kaa bhi rahata tha
 Such ammo proved to be very successful
 stamping mashin ke upyog main, jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, khatre kaa bhay tha
 Chakra or wheel mill was used in its place
 aajkal bhi chakra yaa hvil mil kaa unnat rup hi prayukt hota he
 It has a horizontal isha, which rotates by moving the vertical spindle
 spindal main lohe ke do baari chakra jude rahete hai, jinka bhaar 10 se 12 ton tak or vyas chah foot hota he
 About 300 pounds of liquid is brewed at one time
 pani daalkar use geela rakhte hai
 The grinding takes place in four to five hours
 phir vah dabaaya jaataa he
 There is a pressure of 3,000 to 4,000 pounds per square inch
 aise utpaada kaa ghanatv 1
74 se 1
80 tak hota he
 Breaking it again obtains grains of various expansions
 is vidhi main samay kuch adhik lagata tha
 Hence, some further improvements have been made in it
 do lohe ke kaksh, drum ke aakaar ke rahete hai
 In one, salt sulfur and in the other coal is smelled by sulfur balls
 chaar ghante main vibhinn avyav purna rup se churna ho jate hai
 After extracting the powder from both the chambers, placing it in the third copper drum, grind it with wood balls for two hours, in which the powder is formed
 is vidhi ko belannaal vidhi kehete hai
 All Pandavas were proficient in all types of learning
 pandavon ne sampoorn dishaao par vijay pai or yudhisthir rajya karne lage
 There were many pictures in the built-in assembly
 duryodhana jab vahaan gum rahaa tha tab usko anek baar sthal par jal kii, jal par sthal kii, diwaar main daravaaje kii or daravaaje main diwaar kii bhranti hui
 Somewhere he fell in the ladder due to the leveling of the plane and somewhere the water got wet in the water as a place
 aise hi ek baawali main uske gir jane par yudhisthir ke atirikt shesh chaaron pandav hansane lage
 Duryodhana was not famous
 at: irshyaa, lajja aadi se jal uthaa
 In the Rajsuya Yagna, the king brought many kinds of gifts
 dwijon main pradhan kunind ne dharmraj ko bhent main ek shankh diya, jo anndaan karne par swayan baj uthta tha
 Due to his sound, all the kings present there became immobile and unconscious, only Dhrishtadyumna, Pandava, Satyaki and eighth Shri Krishna stood patiently
 duryodhana aadi ke murchhit hone par pandav aadi jor-jor se hansane lage tathaa arjuna ne atyant prasann hokar ek brahman ko paanch sau bail samarpit kiye
 Yudhishthira gave the conch as a gift to Arjuna
 anek ghatnaon se duryodhana chidh gaya thaan at: hastinapur jate hue usne mamaa shakuni ke saath pandavon ko haraakar unka vaibhav hastgat karne kii ek yukti sochin shakuni dyutakrida main nipun tha-yudhisthir ko shauk avashya tha kintu khelnaa nahin aata tha
 So they all celebrated Dhritarashtra together
 vidura ke virodh karne par bhi dhritarashtra ne usee ko indraprastha jaakar yudhisthir ko aamantrit karne ke liye kaha, saath hi yah bhi kaha ki vah pandavon ko unki yojana ke vishay main kuch na bataaye
 Vidur brought his message and invited the Pandavas
 pandavon ke hastinapur main pahunchane par vidura ne unako ekant main sampurna yojana se avgat kar diya tathaapi yudhisthir ne chunauti sweekaar kar lee tathaa dyutakrida main ve vyaktigat samast daav haarane ke baad bhaaiyon ko, swayan apane ko tathaa ant main draupadi ko bhi haar baithe
 Vidur said that after losing himself at stake, Yudhishthira was no longer entitled to place Draupadi at stake, but Dhritarashtra sent a servant named Pratami to bring Draupadi there
 draupadi ne usase yahi prashn kiya ki dharmaputra ne pehle koun sa daanv haara he- swayan apana athwa draupadi kaa
 Duryodhan got angry and told the government that he brought Draupadi to the synagogue
 yudhisthir ne gupt rup se ek vishwast sevak ko draupadi ke paas bheja ki yadhyapi vah rajaswala he tathaa ek vastra main he, vah waisi hi uth kar chali aaye, sabha main poojya varg ke saamne uskaa us dasha main kalapate hue pahunchnaa duryodhana aadi ke paapon ko vyakt karne ke liye paryaapt hoga
 When Draupadi reached the assembly, the misery did not let her go towards the female class and pulled her hair and said - 'we have won you in gambling
 at: tuje apni daasiyon main rakhenge
 Draupadi defied the valor, religion and policy of all Kuruvanshis and prayed to Krishna to save his shame after remembering him
 sab maun rahe kintu duryodhana ke chote bhai vikarn ne draupadi kaa paksh lete hue kaha ki haara hua yudhisthir use daanv par nahin rakh saktaa tha kintu kisi ne uski baat nahin suni
 Due to Karna's instigation, the misery tried to expel Draupadi
 udhar vilaap karti hui draupadi ne pandavon kii ore dekha to bhim ne yudhisthir se kaha ki vah uske haath jala dena chahta he, jinase usne jua khelaa tha
 Arjuna pacified him
 bhim ne shapath lee ki vah du:shashan kii chaati kaa khun piyegaa tathaa duryodhana kii jaangh ko apni gada se nasht kar daalega
 Draupadi remembered Sri Krishna in a terrible calamity
 shrikrishna kii krupa se anek vastra vahaan prakat hue jinase draupadi aachhadit rahi falat: uske vastra khinchakar utaarte hue bhi du:shashan use nagn nahin kar paaya
 In the assembly, there were repeated disputes over the impropriety or justification of the work
 duryodhana ne pandavon ko maun dekh 'draupadi kii, daanv main haare jane' kii baat thik he yaa galat, iskaa nirnay bhim, arjuna, nakul tathaa sahadev par chhod diya
 Arjun and Bhima said that the person who has defeated himself at stake, cannot keep any other thing at stake
 dhritarashtra ne sabha kii nabj pahachaanakar duryodhana ko fatkaaraa tathaa draupadi se teen var maangane ke liye kaha

 Latika Ghosh was an Oxford-educated teacher and freedom fighter
 vah 1928 main subhash chandra bose ke kehane par mahila rashtriya sangha shuru kar diya
 misses ke uddeshy raajnneetik kaam ke liye mahilaon ke kaaryakartaaon jutaney dwaara swatantraaa ke liye ladane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It was born out of efforts to mobilize resistance to the Latika Simon Commission, which Bose deeply influenced
 unhone tippanee kii he ki agar vah latikaa kii tarah das se mahila shramikon ho saktaa he vah ek sau saal se mahilaon ke kaaran agrim saktaa he
 Latika was an expert on mobilizing people and scaffolding that would have to fight for the cause to fire with his imaginations and inspire them 
 vah misses ke adhyaksh basanti devi, asahyog andolan ke ek anbhavi ke rup main hone ke vichaar vito laga, subhash bose kii maan Prabhabati ek kalpit sardaar ke rup main pasand ke rup main vah saadhaaran gruhiniyon ke liye apil or bengal kii maan ke rup main pratishtha ko sanghathan ke liye udhaar de sabase acha gyaat kaaryakarta

 dengue bukaar ek sankraman he jo dengue virus ke kaaran hota he
 It is very important to treat dengue on time
 Mosquitoes transmit dengue virus
 dengue bukaar ko "hadditod bukaar" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, kyonki isse peedit logon ko itnaa adhik dard ho saktaa he ki jaise unki haddiyaan tut gayi hon
 Some symptoms of dengue fever include fever; Headache; Skin rashes such as rash and muscle and joint pain are included
 kuch logon main, dengue bukaar ek yaa do aise roopon main ho saktaa he jo jivan ke liye khatra ho sakate hai
 First, dengue is hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding or leakage in blood vessels, and low levels of blood platelets
 doosraa dengue shock syndrome he, jisase khatarnaak rup se nimna raktchaap hota he
 There are four different types of dengue virus
 yadi kisi vyakti ko inamen se kisi ek prakaar ke virus kaa sankraman ho jaye to aamtaur par uske puure jivan main vah us prakaar ke dengue virus se surakshit rahata he
 However, with the remaining three types, he remains safe for some time
 yadi usko in teen main se kisi ek prakaar ke virus se sankraman ho to use gambhir samasyaayein hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi adhik hoti he
 There is no vaccine available to protect people from dengue virus
 dengue bukaar se logon ko bachaane ke liye kuch upaay hai, jo kiye jane chaiye
 People can protect themselves from mosquitoes and limit the number of bites from them
 vaigyanik machharon ke panpane kii jagahon ko chota tathaa kam karne ko kehete hai
 If someone has dengue fever, he can usually be cured by drinking enough liquid until his illness is reduced or limited
 yadi vyakti kii sthiti adhik gambhir he to, use antah shira dravya yaa rakt aadhaan kii jarurat ho sakati he
 Since 1960, many people are suffering from dengue fever
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad se yah beemaari ek vishwavyaapee samasya ho gayi he
 It is common in 110 countries
 prayek varsh lagbhag 50-100 million log dengue bukaar se peedit hote hai
 People are working on vaccines and medicines to directly treat the virus
 machharon se mukti paane ke liye log, kai saare alag-alag upaay bhi karte hai
 The first description of dengue fever was written in 1779
 20veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main vaigyanikon ne yah janaa ki beemaari dengue virus ke kaaran hoti he tathaa yah machharon ke madhyam se sancharit hoti he
 Dengue was first written many years ago
 jin samrajya ke ek chini chikitsa vishwakosh ek aise vyakti kii baat karata he jise sambhawatah dengue hua tha
 The book tells of a "water poison" disease that was related to flying insects
 17 veen shatabdi ke likhit dastauez bhi ek aisi mahamari kii charchaa karte hai jo dengue ho sakati he 
 The earliest reports of the most likely dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780
 ye report ek aisi mahamari kii baat karti hai jisane asia, africa tathaa uttari america ko apane ghere main le liya tha
 Not many pandemics occurred from that time until 1940
 1906 main vaigyanikon ne siddh kiya ki logon ko "adies" machharon se sankraman ho rahaa tha
 In 1907, scientists showed that viruses are the cause of dengue
 yah maatr doosraa rog tha jise virus se hota dikhaaya gaya tha 
 John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler continued to study dengue virus and found out the basis of the virus's expansion
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke baad dengue adhik teji se failane laga
 The war is believed to have changed the environment in many ways
 bhinn prakaar ke dengue naye kshetron main faile
 People started having hemorrhagic dengue fever for the first time
 degu kaa yah bheeshan prakaar sabase pehle 1953 main philippines main report kiya gaya
 Hemorrhagic dengue fever became the leading cause of death in children in the 1970s
 yah prashanth kshetra tathaa america main bhi hone laga
 Hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central and South America in 1981
 is samay swasthya seva peshewaron ne yah dekha ki jin logon ko tip 1 dengue virus kaa asar ho chukaa tha unako kuch varshon ke baad tip 2 dengue virus kaa asar ho rahaa tha
 It is not clear where the word "dengue" came from
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yah shabd swahili ke vaakyansh kaa-dinga pepo se aayaa he
 This phrase refers to the disease caused by evil spirits
 mana jaataa he ki swahili shabd dinga spani ke shabd dengue se bana he
 The word means "careful"
 vah shabd ek aise vyakti ke bare main bataane ke liye upyog kiya gaya ho saktaa he jo dengue bukhaar ke haddi ke dard se peedit ho; vah dard us vyakti ko saavdhaanee ke saath chalane par majaboor karata hoga
 However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili language, not as mentioned above
 anya logon kaa maananaa he ki "dengue" naam west indies se aayaa he
 In the West Indies, dengue-afflicted slaves were called standing and walking like "a dandy", and for this reason the disease was also called "dandy fever"
 "haddi-tod bukhaar " naam sabase pehle ek chikitsak sanyukt rajya amareeki "sansthaapak janak" benjamin rash dwaara upyog kiya gaya tha
 In 1789 Rush used the name "bone-breaking fever" in a report on the outbreak of dengue in 1780 in Philadelphia
 report main rash ne adhik aupchaarik naam "billiyas remitting fever" kaa adhiktar upyog kiya
 The term "dengue fever" was not generally in use until 1828
 iske pehle rog ke liye bhinn log bhinn naam upyog karte the
 For example, dengue was also called "breakheart fever" and "la dengue"
 jatil dengue ke liye kai naam upyog kiye jate the: udhaaharan ke liye "infectios thrombokytopanic parpura", "philipine", "thai" tathaa "singapore hemoragic fever"
 The first pandemic attack of Dangu occurred simultaneously in Asia, Africa, North America, around 1780, the disease was recognized and named in 1779
 1950 ke dashak me yah dakshin purv asia yah nirantar mahamari rup me failana shuru hua tathaa 1975 tak dengue hemarej fever in deshon me bal mrityu kaa pradhan kaaran ban gaya he
 By the 1990s, dengue became the second largest disease spread by mosquitoes after malaria, infecting 40 million people a year, while thousands of cases of dengue haemorrhage also occur
 farvari 2002 me hi jab rio-di-genero me dengue ke prasar hua to 10 lakh log isaki chapet me aa gayi the jisase 16 log mar gayi
 Till March 2008, the condition was not very good in this city, there were 23,555 cases and 30 deaths in only 3 months
 lagbhag har paanch se chah saal me dengue kaa bada prakope hota he aisa is liye hota he ki vaarshik chakra jo is rog ke aate he wo rogiyon ko kuch samay hetu pratirodh kshamta de detaa he jaise ki chikangunia ke maamalon me hota he
 When this resistance ceases, people become susceptible to the disease again, then there are four types of dengue viruses, besides new ones are added to the population by birth or migration
 is baat ke paryaapt pramaan he es
bi
helstid ne ek adhyayan dwaara siddh kar diya he ki dengue hamerej fever un rogiyon ko zyada hota he jo dwitiyak sankraman se grast hue ho jo ki praathmik sankraman se bhinn prakaar ke virus se hota he
 Although this notion has not been properly understood, there are only a few models that express their views about it, this condition is called the condition of transitivity
 singapore me prativarsh is rog ke 4000-5000 maamle saamne aate he yadhpi aam dharna yah he ki bahut se maamle chupe rah jate he
 Dengue symptoms About 80% of people infected with dengue virus have no symptoms or very mild symptoms
 sankramit logon main se lagbhag 5% log gambhir rup se biimaar padate hai
 In a small number of these people, the disease is life-threatening
 dengue virus se peedit hone ke 3 se 14 dinon ke baad kisi vyakti main lakshan dikhte hai
 Symptoms often appear only after 4 to 7 days
 is tarah yadi koi vyakti aise kshetra se lautataa he jahaan dengue aam he or uske lautne ke 14 din yaa uske baad usko bukaar hota he yaa anya lakshan dikhte hai to shaayad usko dengue nahin he
 Often when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are common cold (cold or gastroenteritis)
 halanki, bacchon main dengue bukaar dwaara gambhir samasyaayein hone kii adhik sambhaavnaaen hoti hai
 The ideal symptoms of dengue fever are less which start suddenly like headache; Rashes and muscle and joint pain
 beemaari kaa upnaam "hadditod bukaar" yah darshata he ki yah dard kitna gambhir ho saktaa he
 Dengue fever three stages bukaar sambandhi charan main, kisi vyakti ko aamtaur par ucch bukaar hota he
 Fever is often 40 ° C
 vyakti ko saamaanya dard tathaa sirdard ho saktaa he
 This phase usually lasts 2 to 7 days
 is charan main jin logon main lakshan hote hai unamem se lagbhag 50 se 80% logon ko chakatte ho jate hai
 On the first or second day, the rash may look like red skin
 beemaari ke baad ke dinon main chakatte chechak jaise lag sakate hai
 Small red spots may emerge on the skin
 twachaa ko dabaane par yah daag hatate nahin hai
 These red stains are formed due to broken capillaries
 vyakti ko shleshm jhilli dwaara munh tathaa naak se halkaa raktasrav ho saktaa he
 Fever starts decreasing on its own and returns for a day or two
 halanki, bhinn logon main yah pattern bhinn hota he
 In some people, the disease enters a critical stage after high fever
 gambhir charan ek se do dinon tak chalata he
 During this phase, fluid can build up in the chest and abdomen, because there is a leakage in the blood vessels
 taral banataa he tathaa yah puure sharir main parisancharit hota he
 This means that vital organs do not usually receive blood as per their requirement
 is kaaran se, ang saamaanya tareeke se kaam nahin kar pate hai
 The person may also have excessive bleeding
 dengue se peedit 5% se kam vyaktiyon ko parisancharan aghat, dengue aghat syndrome tathaa dengue rakthasravi bukaar hota he
 If a person has had any other type of dengue before, then he is more likely to have such serious problems
 sudhaar charan main, vah taral jo rakt nalikaaon se baahar ris jaataa he, raktapravaah main waapas shaamil kar liya jaataa he
 The correction phase lasts 2 to 3 days
 vyakti aksar is charan ke dauraan kaaphi behatar ho jaataa he
 However, they may complain of severe itching and slow heart rate
 is charan ke dauraan, vyakti taral overlod sthiti main ja saktaa he
 If it affects the brain, it can cause a change in the level of consciousness or a condition like seizures
 kabhi-kabhaar dengue hamaare sharir ke anya tantron ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 a person may have only symptoms or may even have ideal dengue symptoms
 0
5–6% maamalon main chetana kaa str ghat saktaa hai
 This can happen when the dengue virus causes brain infection
 aisa tab bhi ho saktaa he jab mahatvapurn ang sahi bhang se kaam na kar rahe hon
 Other nervous disorders have been reported in people who have dengue fever
 udhaaharan ke liye, dengue transwars militis tathaa guilian-bare syndrome paidaa kar saktaa he
 Although this is not nearly the case, dengue can cause heart infection and severe liver failure
 dengue bukhaar dengue virus ke kaaran hota he
 The scientific system in which the virus is classified and named includes the dengue virus as part of the "flaviviridae" family and the "flavivirus" gene
 anya virus bhi is parivaar se sambandhit hai tathaa maanvon main bimaariyaan paidaa kar sakate hai
 For example, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St
 Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kaysanur jungle disease virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever, all belong to the "flaviviridae" family
 
 inamen se adhiktar virus machharon yaa tik dwaara failte hai
 Dengue virus is mostly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti type mosquitoes
 ye machhar aamtaur par 350 uttar tathaa 350 dakshin akshans par, 1000 meter se kam oonchai par hote hai
 They are mostly cut during the day
 inke ek baar kaatane se bhi maanav sankramit ho saktaa he
 Sometimes mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans
 yadi maadaa machhar kisi sankramit vyakti ko kaat le to machhar ko dengue virus mil saktaa he
 First the virus resides in the cells that are in the stomach of the mosquito
 lagbhag 8 se 10 dinon ke baad virus, machhar kii laar granthiyaan jo laar banaati hai, unamem sankramit ho jate hai
 This means that the saliva made by the mosquito is infected with the dengue virus
 isaliye jab machhar maanav ko katate hai to inaki sankramit laar maanav ko sankramit kar sakati he
 Viruses do not appear to cause any problems for infected mosquitoes, which will remain infected throughout their life
 is baat kii sambhaavna sabase adhik hoti he ki adies aegypti machhar dengue failaata he
 This is because they live closest to humans and live on humans rather than animals
 yah maanav-nirmit pani rakhane ke paatro main andey dena pasand karte hai
 Dengue can spread through infected blood products and organ donation
 yadi dengue se sankramit vyakti rakt daan yaa ang daan karata he, jo kisi anya vyakti ko diya jaataa he, is vyakti ko daan diye gayi rakt yaa ang se dengue ho saktaa he
 Dengue is common in some countries such as Singapore
 in deshon main, 10,000 rakt aadhanon main se 1
6 se 6 tak dengue failaate hai
 Dengue virus can also spread from mother to child during pregnancy or while giving birth to a child
 dengue aamtaur par kinhi or tareekon se nahin failata he
 Infants and children are more likely to develop the disease severity than adults with dengue
 bachche yadi acchhee tarah se poshit hon to unke gambhir rup se biimaar hone kii adhik sambhaavna he 
 Men are more prone to serious illness than women
 puraani kii bimaariyaan jaise madhumeh tathaa asthma vaale logon main dengue jivan ke liye khatra ho saktaa he
 When a mosquito bites a person, its saliva enters the human skin
 yadi machhar ko dengue he to virus isaki laar main hota he
 Therefore, when a mosquito bites a person, the virus enters the person's skin along with the mosquito's saliva
 virus vyakti kii shwet rakt kanikaon se jud kar unamem pravesh kar jaataa he 
 The virus regenerates when white blood cells move around the body
 shwet rakt kanikaayen kai tarah ke sanketon protein ke madhyam se pratikriya karti hai jaise interlukins, interferon tathaa tumor parigalan kaarak
 Dengue causes fever, flu-like symptoms and severe pain due to these proteins
 yadi kisi vyakti ko gambhir sankraman hai to virus uske sharir main or adhik teji se badhata he
 Because the number of viruses is very high, it can affect many more organs
 choti rakt keshikaon kii deevaaron se rakt ris karke sharir ke cotaron main chalaa jaataa he
 For this reason there is less blood flow to the blood capillaries
 vyakti kaa raktchaap itnaa kam ho jaataa he ki hriday mahatvapurn angon ko paryaapt rakt kii aapurti nahin kar paata he
 Also, the bone marrow does not produce enough platelets, which is necessary to make a blood clot
 paryaapt platelets ke bina, vyakti ko raktasrav hone kii samasya hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna he
 Bleeding is the main complication caused by dengue
 swasthya seva peshewar aamtaur par sankramit vyakti kii jaanch karke or yah dekh kar ki uske lakshan dengue se milte hai, dengue kaa nidaan karte hai
 Healthcare professionals may thus be particularly capable of diagnosing dengue in areas where it typically occurs
 halanki, jab dengue praarambhik avasthaa main hota he to ise anya viral sankramanon se alag kar paanaa kathin hota he
 Dengue can possibly occur when a person has fever and has two of the following symptoms: nausea and vomiting; Red spots; General pain; Reduced number of white blood cells; Or positive tourniquet test
 ve kshetra jahaan par yah biimaar aam he vahaan par koi bhi chetavanee chihn tathaa bukhaar is baat kaa sanket he ki vyakti ko dengue he
 Warning signs usually appear before dengue becomes severe
 turnicket pareekshan tab kaaphi hota he jab koi prayogshaala pareekshan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In a tourniquet test, a healthcare professional ties the blood pressure measuring device strap around the person's arms for 5 minutes
 phir yadi us vyakti kii twachaa par laal dhabbe dikhen to swasthya seva peshewar unki ginati karata he
 The higher the number of spots, the more likely a person is to have dengue fever
 chikangunia tathaa dengue bukhaar ke bich antar karnaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Chikungunya is a viral infection that has similar symptoms as dengue and it also occurs in those parts of the world
 dengue ke lakshan anya bimariyon malaria, leptopyrosis, typhoed bukhaar tathaa meningocokkal rog jaise ho sakate hai
 Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their healthcare professionals will do some tests to make sure that the person does not suffer from one of these conditions
 jab kisi vyakti ko dengue hota he to uski shwet rakt kanikaon kii kam sankhya kaa prayogshaala pareekshan main dikhnaa sabase pehla parivartan dekha ja saktaa he
 Low platelet counts and metabolic acidosis are also symptoms of dengue
 yadi vyakti ko gambhir dengue he to aise anya badlaav bhi honge jo rakt kaa adhyayan karne par dekhe ja sakate hai
 Severe dengue can cause fluid leakage from blood streams
 jiske kaaran hemokonsontrishan ho saktaa he
 It also reduces albumin levels in the blood
 kabhi-kabhaar gambhir dengue adhik phuffus pravaah yaa jalodar bhi utpann karata he
 If its volume is sufficient, the healthcare professional may observe it at the time of the patient's testing
 koi swasthya seva peshewar dengue ke shock syndrome ko pehle hi dekh saktaa he yadi vah sharir ke bheetar dravya dekhne ke liye chikitsiya ultrasound kaa upyog kar sake
 But in many areas where dengue is common, most healthcare professionals and clinics do not have ultrasound machines
 2009 main vishwa swasthya sanghathan nen dengue bukhaar ko do prakaaron main vargeekrut yaa vibhajit kiya: saral tathaa gambhir
 Earlier in 1997, WHO divided the disease into indistinguishable and dengue fever
 WHO ne tay kiya ki dengue bukhaar ko vibhajit karne ke is puraane tareeke ko saral karne kii zarurat he
 It also decided that the old method was quite limited: it did not include all the ways in which dengue could present itself
 halanki dengue vargeekaran kaa tarika aadhikarik rup se badla gaya tha lekin purana vargeekaran abhi bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 In the old method of WHO, dengue hemorrhagic fever was divided into four stages, which were called grades i – IV: dengue bukhaar kaa nidaan microbiloji sambandhi prayogshaala pareekshan dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Some different tests can also be done
 koshikaon ke culture main ek pareekshan dengue virus ko pruthak karata he
 Another test identifies nucleic acids from viruses, using a technique called polymerase chain reaction
 ek teesraa pareekshan virus ke antigen kii pahchaan karata he
 Another test identifies antibodies in the blood that give the body the ability to fight against dengue virus
 virus isolation tathaa neucleic amla pahchaan pareekshan, antigen pahchaan se behatar kaam ke hote hai
 Although these tests cost more, they are not available in many locations
 jab dengue rog apane praarambhik charnon main hota he to yah saare pareekshan nakaaratmak ho sakate hai Apart from immunological testing, these laboratory tests can only be helpful in the diagnosis of dengue fever during the acute phase of the disease
 halanki, pratirakshi pareekshan is baat kii pushti kar sakate hai ke vyakti ko dengue, sankraman kii baad kii avasthaa kaa he
 The body produces antibodies that typically fight the dengue virus 5 to 7 days later
 dengue virus se logon ko bachaane ke liye abhi tak kisi vaxin ko sweekrut nahin kiya gaya he
 To prevent infection, the World Health Organization has suggested controlling the mosquito population and protecting people from mosquito bites
 WHO ne dengue ke rokthaam ke liye ek kaarykram kaa suzav diya he jisamen 5 bhinn bhaag shaamil hai: The WHO also makes some specific suggestions to control mosquitoes and protect people from being bitten by it
 "adies aegypti" machhar ko niyantrit karne kaa sabase acha tarika yah he ki iske nivaason se mukti paayi jaay
 People should keep empty containers of water empty
 in kshetron main machharon ko niyantrit karne ke liye kitnashkon yaa jaivik niyantran agenton kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Scientists believe that spraying of organophosphate or pyrethyroid insecticide does not help
 tehre hue pani ko samaapt karnaa chaiye kyonki yah machharon ko aakarshith karata he or isaliye bhi ki is tehre huye pani main jeevanuon ke paidaa hone se logon ko swasthya sambandhi samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 To avoid mosquito bites, people can wear clothes that completely cover their skin
 ve ketterodhiyon kaa upyog kar sakate hai, jo machharon ko dur rakhenge 
 People can also use miscarriages while resting
 is samay koi vaxin bazaar me maujuud nahin he yadhpi thailand me prayog kaaphi had tak safal rahe he
 The most effective way to prevent dengue is to control the population of mosquitoes by either controlling larvae or the population of adult mosquitoes
 adis machhar kritrim jal sangrah paatro me janan karte he jaise tair, bottlen, cooler, guladaste in jalpatro ko aksar khaali karnaa chahie yahi sabase behatar tarika larva niyantran kaa mana jaataa he
 Pesticide fumes can be effective to some extent to control adult mosquitoes, preventing mosquitoes from biting is also a way, but mosquitoes of this species bite during the day, making the case serious
 ek nayaa tarika messosaclopus naamak jaleey keet jo larva bhakshi he ko ruke jal me daal dena he jaise ki gambushia machhlee malaria ke viruddh prabhavi upaay he
 This is a very effective, inexpensive and environment friendly method, mosquitoes can never gain immunity against it, but community participation is actively needed for this
 machharadaani, riplent, sharir ko dhak ke rakhana, tathaa prabhavit kshetron se dur rahanaa
 The yellow fever of yellow fever is against a related flavivirus, it is recommended to use it in a mutated form against dengue, but no detailed study has been done in this regard
 argentina ke ek vaigyanik samooh ne 2006 me vishaanu ke prajnan tareeke ko khoj nikaala he jiske chalate aashaa kii jaati he ki uske viruddh prabhavi aushadhi khoj nikaali jaayegi
 There is no specific treatment for dengue fever
 lakshanon ke aadhaar par, bhinn logon ke liye bhinn upachaar hai
 Some people may be better off just by drinking liquid at home, with their healthcare professionals monitoring their health closely to ensure they are getting better
 kuch anya logon ko antahshira dravya yaa rakt aadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 If a person already has a problem with a complex health condition, healthcare professionals may decide to hospitalize the person
 jab kisi vyakti ko antahshira dravya kii jarurat hoti he to aam taur par unako isaki jarurat ek yaa do din ke liye ho sakati he
 The healthcare professional will increase the amount of fluid so that the person can release a specified amount of urine
 taral kii maatra isaliye bhi badhaayi ja sakati he jisase ki vyakti kii hematokrit tathaa mahatvapurn chihn saamaanya sthiti par waapas aa sake
 Due to the risk of bleeding, healthcare professionals avoid invasive medical procedures such as nasogastric intubation, intra-articular injection and puncture in the arteries
 bukhaar tathaa dard ke liye essetaminophen di ja sakati he
 a type of anti-inflammatory drug called NSAID should not be used as there is a high chance of bleeding
 yadi vyakti ke mahatvapurn chihn badalen yaa saamaanya na ho or yadi unke rakt main laal rakt kanikaon kii sankhya kam hoti ja rahi ho to rakt aadhaan ko jaldi shuru kiya janaa chaiye
 When blood transfusion is required, the person should be given whole blood or packed red blood cells
 platelets tathaa tazaa freez kiya plasma, aam taur par sanstut nahin kiya jaataa he
 When a person is in the dengue correction phase, he or she is usually not given any intravenous fluid so that the amount of fluid in his body is not high
 yadi dravya kii adhikta ho jaay lekin us vyakti ke mahatvapurn chihn sthir hon to sirf or dravya diye jane ko rokna hi paryaapt he
 If the person is not in a complicated state of the disease, he may be given loop diuretics like furosemide
 yah us vyakti ke rakt parisancharan se atirikt dravya ko baahar karne main sahaayak honge
 Most people suffering from dengue recover and do not have any problems later
 dengue se sankramit logon main 1 se 5% kii upachaar ke abhaav main mrityu ho jaati he
 Despite good treatment, less than 1% of people die
 halanki, gambhir dengue se peedit logon main se 26% kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Dengue is common in more than 110 countries
 prayek varsh, puri duniya ke 50 se 100 million log isse prabhavit hote hai
 Each year, half a million people are hospitalized and around 12,500 to 25,000 people die due to it all over the world
 dengue, sandhipadon dwaara failane vaala sabase aam viral rog he
 It is believed that over 1600 per dengue population per million of dengue has a disability adjusted life year weight
 iskaa arth he ki dengue ke kaaran prati million jansankhya main se 1600 varshon kaa jivan samaapt ho jaataa he
 This is the same as the disease burden of other childhood or tropical diseases like TB
 dengue malariake baad duusare number kii sabase mahatvapurn ushnkaribandheey beemaari he
 The World Health Organization also considers dengue one of the 16 neglected tropical diseases

 vah aitihaasik kram se kalantar main itani badal jaati he ki uskaa swaroop uske mul bhugolic yaa sthaneey rup se bilkul bhinn ho jaataa he

 dhwani parivartan ke anek kaarnon main se ek uccharan main suvidha yaa praytn-laghav ko pramukh mana jaataa he
 Often, when pronouncing many words, there is a tendency to pronounce difficult sounds coming in them by turning them into easy sound for convenience
 jaise- sanyukt vyanjan ke uccharan main kathinaayee hone par aasaani se shabd kaa uccharan karne ke liye uske ek vyanjan kaa lop kar diya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye, 'dwi' kaa 'do', yaa 'sneh' kaa 'neh' uccharan
 Apart from this, pronunciation is also facilitated by the use of easy sounds or by changing the order of sounds
 jaise 'brahman' kaa 'bramhan' uccharan
 Similarly, due to the sounds around you, any sound gets changed by use
 jaise- yadi kisi aghosh vyanjan ke aasapaas kori ghosh vyanjan ho to vah ghosh ho jaataa he
 Such as 'kangan' of 'kankan' or 'saag' of 'shak'
 isi prakaar, kisi duusare shabd se samanta ke kaaran kuch shabdon kii dhvaniyaan unheen ke samaan bole jane ke kaaran parivartit ho jaati hai
 For example, the word 'ekadash' in Sanskrit came to be spoken as 'ekadash' on the analogy of 'dwadash'
 in aitihaasik parivartanon ke atirikt bhashaaon ke aapasi sampark ke kaaran bhi dhwani parivartan hote hai
 When some words of one language are adopted in another language, there is a sound change
 udhaaharan ke liye 'mumbari' marathi kaa tatsam rup he
 Which is changed to 'bombay' in Hindi and 'bombay' in English
 yah dhwani parivartan bhashaa bhed yaa bhugolic parivartan ke kaaran hua he
 Sound changes also occur due to geographical expansion
 kshetra badalane se bhashaa main badlaav aata he
 There is also a lot of change in the pronunciation of the sounds of a language whose geographical spread is from the country

 anterrashtriya sambandh ko kabhi-kabhi 'antararashtriya adhyayan' ) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, haalanki donon shabd puri tarah se paryaay nahin hai
 In simple terms, 'international politics' means 'doing politics among states'
 yadi 'raajnneeti' ke arth kaa adhyayan karen to teen pramukh tatv saamne aate hai - samoohon kaa astitv; samoohon ke bich sahmati; tathaa samoohon dwaara apane hiton kii purti
 If we assess this effect internationally, then these three elements are mainly - the existence of states; Conflict between states; And the use of power to fulfill their national interests
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti un kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa he jiske antargat rajya apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu shakti ke aadhaar par sangharshrat rahete hai
 In this context, national interests are the main goals of international politics; Conflict sets its direction; And Shakti is considered as the main means of achieving this objective
 parantu uparyukt paribhaasha ko ham paramparaagat maan sakate hai, kyonki aaj ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ kaa sthaan isse vyapak avadharana ‘antarrashtriya sambandhon’ ne le liya he
 Under this, along with mutual conflict of states, the collaborative aspects are now studied under international politics
 iske atirikt aaj ‘rajyon’ ke alaava anya kai kaarak bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ban gaye hai
 Therefore, under this, individuals, institutions, organizations and many other non-state units have also joined
 iskaa vartmaan aadhaar va vishay kshetra aaj kaaphi vyapak swaroop le chukaa he
 Before discussing all these topics, it becomes very essential to review the following definitions given by different scholars- in paribhaashaon kaa dayera ati simit he, kyonki iske antargat multah ‘rajyon’ ko hi anterrashtriya raajnneeti ke kaarak ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is limited to the nature of international politics
 mukhya rup se hence je
 margenthau, herald spraoot, bone doyak, thampsan aadi iske mukhya samarthak hai jo inaki nimna paribhaashaon se spasht ho jaataa he- International definitions discuss the broad nature of international politics, international relations
 isamen rajya ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke naveen karkon jaise antarrashtriya sanghathan, deshaantar samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, antarrashtriya santhaayen, kuch vyaktiyon aadi ko bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, along with the struggle, cooperation and politics, as well as directly or indirectly affecting it, ie, cultural, religious, social, science and technical aspects are also mentioned
 vibhinn lekhakon kii nimnlikhit paribhaashaon se yah aashay ati spasht rup main ujagar ho jaataa he- In this way the nature of international politics becomes very broad from the beginning to the present
 isamen aaj raashtra rajyon ke saath vibhinn vishwa ikaayiyon evam sanghathanon ke adhyayan kaa samavesh ho chukaa he
 But even after all these changes, the focal point of these studies is still a nation state
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ke bare main nimna nishkarsh saamne aate hai
 Therefore, the nature of international politics is variable
 jab-jab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke parivesh, karkon va ghatnakram main parivartan aayegaa, iske adhyayan karne ke tareekon va drushtikonon main bhi parivartan anivaary he
 Additionally, this change is continuous rather than permanent
 iske saath-saath vibhinn karkon, staron, ayaamon aadi ke kaaran yah bahut jatil he atah iske sucharu adhyayan hetu bahut spasht, tarksangat, vyapak drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As is known from the above definitions and form, the subject area of international politics is increasing
 aaj iskaa vishay kshetra kaaphi vyapak ho gaya he jiske antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- Therefore, today the subject area of international politics is very broad and complex and is moving towards development
 iske antargat vibhinn paramparaagat karkon ke saath-saath gaiyr-paramparaagat karkon kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn hota ja rahaa he
 The history of the development of international politics is not very ancient, rather the subject is a product of the twentieth century

 Kenneth Thompson in his 1962 review, Review of Politics, has divided the history of international politics into four parts, on the basis of which a clear and sure study of this subject can be possible
 vikaas ke in chaar charnon main shityudhottar yug ke paanchaven charan ko bhi sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their detailed description is as follows: pratham vishwayuddh se purv itihaas, kanoon, raajnneeti shaastra, darshan shaastra aadi ke vidwaan hi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke alag-alag pahaluon par vichaar karte the
 It was mainly historians who studied it as diplomatic history and the history of relations with other countries
 iske antargat kootneetigyon va videsh mantriyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa lekha jokha hota tha
 Hence, it is also known as diplomatic history

car ke anusaar pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh kaa sambandh keval sainikon tak samajha jaataa tha tathaa iske samakaksh antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa sambandh rajanyikon tak
 In addition, even in democratic countries, foreign policy was traditionally kept separate from party politics and the elected members also felt unable to control the foreign ministry
 1919 se purv is vishay ke prati udaseenta ke kai pramukh kaaran the - pratham, is samay tak yahi samajha jaataa tha ki yuddh va rajyon main gathbandhan usee prakaar swaabhaavik he jaise garibi va berogari
 Therefore, preventing war, foreign policy and mutual relations between states was considered out of the control of human power
 dwitiya, pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh itane bhayankar nahin hote the
 Third, in the absence of means of communication, international politics was limited to a few states
 is prakaar is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan kii sabase badi kami saamaanya hiton kaa vikaas rahaa
 In this period, only a descriptive study of diplomatic history was done
 parinamswaroop, isse na to vartmaan tathaa na hi bhavi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main koi madad mili
 The quantum achievement of this era was the establishment of the Chair of the Study of International Politics at the University of Wales in 1919
 do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main do samaanaantar dhaaraon kaa vikaas hua
 The first of which emphasized the study of current events / problems, except for the dominance of earlier historicity
 iske saath saath ab aitihaasik raajnneetik adhyayan ko vartmaan raajnneetik sandarbhon ke saath jod kar dekhne kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 Despite the diminishing of historical influence, there still remains a lack of a holistic approach to the study of international politics
 is kaal main vartmaan ke adhyayan par to bahut bal diya gaya, lekin vartmaan evam ateet ke parsparik sambandh ke mahatv ko abhi bhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya
 In addition, neither was there an attempt to see post-war political problems with comparable problems of the past
 shaayad isiilie is yug main bhi do moolbhoot kamiyaan spasht rup se ujagar raheen
 First, like the first phase, universal principles could not develop in international politics even in this period
 dwitiya, aaj bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa adhyayan adhik suspasht evam tarksangat nahin ban paaya
 Thus, in this phase, there was not much change in the study of international politics except the change in the status of force, nor was the confirmation of this subject becoming an explicitly independent discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa tritiy charan bhi dwitiya charan ke samaanaantar do vishwa yudhon ke bich kaa kaal rahaa
 It is called the era of reformism because it envisaged reform of international politics through the establishment of the League of Nations by the states
 is yug main mukhya rup se sansthagat vikaas kiya gaya
 The scholars, diplomats, politicians and thinkers of this period believed that if international institutions are developed, then the problems of war and peace present in front of the world community will be possible
 is uddeshy hetu kuch kanoonee va naitik upagamon kii sanrachanaayen kii gai jinke nimna mukhya aadhaar the
 International organization was envisaged with emphasis on these ideals and moral values
 isaki sthapana ke uparant yah mana gaya ki ab antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajyon ke madhya shaanti banane kaa sangharsh samaapt ho gaya
 There will be no place of balance of power under the new system
 ab rajya apane vivaadon kaa nipataara sangh ke madhyam se karenge
 Therefore, in this era not only the problems of war and peace were discussed, but its far-reaching reforms were also thought of
 atah adhyayankartaaon ke mukhya bindu bhi kanoonee samasyaon va sanghathanon ke vikaas ke saath-saath inke madhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ko badalane vaala rahaa
 Finally, in this period more emphasis has been laid on emotional, imaginative and moral reformism
 parantu vishwayudhon ke bich in upagamon kii sarthakata par hameshaa prashn chihn laga rahaa
 While the first decade of United Nations activities showed a ray of hope, the economic situation of the second decade completely ended this notion
 badi shaktiyon ke madhya asahyog va gutbandiyon ne shaanti kii sthapana kii bajaay shakti sangharsh vyavastha ko janm diya
 While Japan invaded Manchuria and disrupted peace, Italy, Germany and Russia not only relinquished membership of the League in controversial situations, but also intensified the process of the start of World War II

 The fundamental changes in international politics at this stage not only broadened its content but also led to many complications
 shitayugin kaal main raajnneeti ke swaroop main parivartan tathaa naye rajyon ke udai ne sampoorn antarrashtriya parivesh ko hi badal diya
 As a result, new approaches, dimensions, institutions and trends were created through which the study of international relations was ensured
 purv charnon kii aadarshik, sansthagat, naitik, kanoonee evam sudhaarwadi dhaaraon kii asafalataaon ne naye upagamon ke vikaas kii ore agrasar kiya
 This new approach was realism

 According to this theory, states are always struggling to fulfill their interests
 atah anterrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane hetu is shakti sangharsh ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 International organization also originated in the form of assured and unambiguous development of international institutions with realistic outlook
 ab is sanghathan kaa swaroop maatra adarshavaadi va sudhaarwadi na hokar, mahatvapurn raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main ubhar kar aayaa
 Under this, apart from saving mankind from the ravages of war, what are the reasons for the conflict between the states? What are the risk factors for world peace? How can peace be established? How can arms race be stopped? Efforts were also made to find solutions to many types of questions
 uparokt do pravritiyon ke saath-saath vyavahaarwad kii utpatti bhi is yug kii mahatvapurn uplabdhi rahi
 An attempt was made to understand international politics by creating "system theory" through a pragmatic approach
 is upaagam ke antargat rajyon ke adhyayan hetu teen pramukh karkon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa zaruri mana gaya
 These factors were- uparokt pravritiyon kaa mukhya bal antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saiddhantikaran ko badhaava dena rahaa he
 Therefore, it has been a very important task in this era to propose the universal principles of international politics
 siddhanth nirmaan kii is prakriya ke parinaam swaroop anek aanshik siddhanton jaise - yatharthwaad, santulan kaa siddhanth, sanchaar siddhanth, krida siddhanth, saudebaaji kaa siddhanth, shaanti anusandhan drushtikon, vyavastha siddhanth, vishwa vyavastha pratimaan aadi kaa nirmaan hua
 Despite the rendering of these principles, there still remains a lack of any universal and common principle in this era
 1990 ke dashak main jaint bandhopadhyaay ne apni pustak - general theory of international rilations - main martin kaplan ke vyavasthaaparak siddhanth kii kamiyon ko dur kar ek saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana kii koshish kii he, parantu vah bhi abhi vaad-pratwaad ke daur main hi hai
 Therefore, despite the main phase of theorization, the era of the Cold War remained deprived of any one general principle due to its ideological narrowness and isolation
 shityudhottar yug main sabhi rashtron dwaara ek aarthik vyavastha ke antargat judana prarambh kar diya
 That is why the era of globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 has started
 is sandarbh main na keval aarthik muddon kaa hi mahatv badha, apitu antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa mahatv or bhi bad gaya
 Today, the distinction of nationalism and internationalism has ended
 Apart from this, now the table of international politics has included a lot of new topics which, instead of being national, now emerge as problems of mankind
 vartmaan vishwa kii pramukh samasyaon main aatankwaad, paryaavaran, ozon parat ksheen hona, nashile padaarthon evam maadak dravyon kii taskari, maanavadhikaron kaa hanan aadi pramukh mudde ubhar kar saamne aaye jinka rashtriya str yaa kshetray str kii bajaay antarrashtriya str par hal nikaalnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 Even at the theoretical level, the attempt to establish the universal principle from 1945 to 1991 got a shock
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii is sandarbh main ab praathamiktaayen badal gai
 In post-modernism, the significance of universal principles are now being questioned
 aitihaasik sandarbh evam pracheen parivesh ke prabhaav ko bhi nakaara ja rahaa he
 Now the independent issues have become more important
 vrihat siddhanth gaun ho gaye hai
 Partial research has become more important in the new context
 udhaahranswaroop nariwad, maanavadhikaar, paryaavaran aadi vishyon par adhik bal dene ke saath-saath chintan bhi prarambh ho gaya he
 Therefore, in the post-cold War era, the nature, content and subject area of international politics have completely changed
 ab saamaanya saiddhanthik sthapana par bhi adhik bal nahin diya ja rahaa he
 That is why, in this changed environment, international politics seems to be not only important but also towards autonomy
 or vishay kii swaittata hetu ashaavadi sanket dikhaai dete hai
 The Second World War not only influenced international politics fundamentally, but also expressed many important issues
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke karkon main parivartan, karkon ko vyapak swaroop pradaan karnaa, naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aadi anek vishyon ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa purna parivesh hi badal kar rakh diya he
 While there is a debate on the theoretical level of realism and idealism on the one hand, and on the ancient and scientific debate, on the other hand controversial questions were being raised about the format of international relations topic - whether international relations is a Autonomous subject or not? Although it is being taught as an autonomous subject at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research in most universities today, it is not recognized as equivalent to other subjects of social science
 itnaa avashya hua he ki viksit deshon main to kai vishvavidhyalayon main ise purna rup se swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Developing countries like India have also improved
 yahaan prarambh main ‘bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandh skool, nai dilli’ jo baad main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sambandh skool ke rup main swytt rup se kaary kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, many other universities like Jadavpur University, Calcutta, Goa University etc
 have also got the status of autonomous subjects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ko ek swytt vishay ke rup main adhyayan karne se purv ek baat spasht kerani ati aavashyak he ki jab ham is vishay kii swaittata ke prashn kaa adhyayan karte hai to ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ va antarrashtriya sambandhon ko alag-alag vishay nahin maanate hai
 This has been done because both disciplines are still recognized as a sub-discipline of the subject of political science rather than as an autonomous discipline
 duusare inkaa vibhed itnaa sookshm he ki anushaasan kii swaittata kii pramanikta ke baad is vishay ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the context of considering international politics as an autonomous subject, three different views have been given which are as follows - jo vidwaan is vishay ko swytt maanate hai unke anusaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay vastu va anushaasan sambandhi saamagree ko dekhte hue ise ek swytt vishay mana janaa chahie
 The main proponents of this argument are - CAW
 Manning, Quincy Right, Robert Lotting Allen, Hannes J
 Margenthau, Carl M
 Copper Johnson, Hoffmann; AL Burn etc
 in vidwaanon ne nimna aadhaaron par ise swytt vishay pramanit kiya he- Those scholars who do not consider international politics as an autonomous subject, believe that there is no such unique thing in this subject that it should be considered autonomous for study
 unhone nimna tarko ke aadhaar par apni baat kaa samarthan kiya he- Some scholars consider both of the above debates as meaningless
 unka maananaa yah he ki uparyukt donon tarkon ko antarrashtriya raajnneeti main hue vikaas ke madhyam se adhik bhalee prakaar se janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, a review of the development of the 20th century, and especially after 1945, is extremely essential
 yadi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii swaittata ke prashn kaa gahan adhyayan karte hai to pataa chalata he ki is sandarbh main do moolbhoot samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 One, there have been effective changes in the nature, content and methods of international relations
 doosraa, isi samay raajnneetishastra kii paridhi kii jatiltaaon evam aparibhaashit simaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran samasya or bad gai he
 But if we look at the development of international politics from 1919 till date, it is clear that its achievements will prove very helpful in giving it autonomy
 1919 ke baad se hi, visheshkar america main, bahut se vidwaanon ne is vishay ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane hetu prayaas kiye hai
 Efforts have also been made to explain its content, methods and principles

 After a review in this context, Richard Smythbeel has come to the conclusion that- dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad is sthiti main mahatvapurn parivartan aae hai
 On the one hand, on the one hand, based on new researches in this field, the international relations analytic relations have been strengthened, on the other hand new theories have also been formulated
 america main anek viddhanon mukhya rup se margenthau, richard snidar, martin kaplan, karl dablyoo dois, charles mekalaland aadi ne is ore vishisht yogadan diya he
 In addition, emphasis has been laid on the study of both developed and developing countries
 isaki vishay saamagree kaa sankalan, siddhanth pratipaadan evam paddatiyon kaa bhi kaaphi vikaas hua he
 But even today, the most important deficiency remains the lack of a universal / general principle
 shityudhottar vishwa main iskaa mahatv or bad gaya he
 In this era of globalization, all the states are getting connected with one type of economic system
 antarrashtriya va rashtriya mudde jaise paryaavaran, aatankwaad, nariwad, adj, ozon parat ksheen hona, maanavadhikaar aadi rashtriya kii bajaay maanviya / maanavjaati se sambhddha ho gaye hai
 Therefore, active participation of international forums / organizations is necessary to solve all these
 ab saarvbhaumik siddhanth ko bhi uttar aadhunikwaad kii drushti se nakaar kar vyaktiparak evam sthaneey aadhaar par adhik bal diya gaya he
 Therefore, on the basis of the development after 1945, it can be said to be leading to autonomy, which after 1991 the process of the end of the Cold War has tried to strengthen
