 3 june 2011 Mona Lisa) is a world famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci
 yah ek vichaarmagn stri kaa chithran he jo atyant halki muskaan liye hue hai
 It is probably the most famous painting in the world which is synonymous with painting and visual arts
 aisa mana jaataa he ki italvi chitrakaar leonardo da vinci ne mona lija naamak yah tasviir 1503 se 1506 ke bich banaai thi
 This photo was made from Florence's anonymous friend Liza Gherardini, wife of businessman Francesco del Giocondo

 In this area of the museum, 16th century Italian painting works are kept

 To preserve the picture, it is placed behind a special kind of glass that neither shines nor breaks

 Approximately 500 years ago, this painting was done with oil paints on a 30

 is kalakriti ko banane vaale kaaljayi kalakaar leonardo da vinci kaa janm itli ke florence shahar ke purv disha main sthit vinci naamak ek chote se kasbe main san 1452 ko hua tha
 His father Sir Pierre the Vinci was a notary
 bachapan se hi kala main liyanardo kii gahari ruchi dekhte hue pita ne kala kii ucch shiksha ke liye use paris bhej diya
 Which was a major center of art education at that time, by staying here, he started learning art in one of the Barakia studios
 yahan rahakar liyanardo ne apane guru se chitrakala kaa vyapak gyaan praapt kiya va isaki baarikiyon se parichit hue
 Soon the Guru felt that his disciple was more talented and talented than him, so he gave all the knowledge that Guru had to his disciple Vinci
 chitrakala ke atirikt ejineering, maanav sharir sanrachana ke adhyayan main bhi liyanardo ko maharath hasil thi
 Hundreds of years before the birth of the Wright brothers, it was difficult to imagine an airplane, when Leonardo made a model of a machine flying in the air
 maanav sharir kii jatil sanrachana ko samajhane ke junun ke chalate liyanardo raat ke andhere main kabristaan se shav khod kar studiyon main laakar uski cheerfaad karte
 Used to write detailed notes by cutting and drawing internal organs of human body
 ye aitihaasik rekhachitr va tippaniyan aaj bhi surakshit hai, yun to liyanardo ne apane jivan main saikadon chitra va rekhachitr banaaye hai jinamein se kuch prasiddh kala-kritiyon ke naam hai, da last sapar, madonna in ityadi par jitani adhik khyaati monaalisa naamak kriti ko mili he, vah vastav main haratangez he
 This painting, which adorned the French royal art collection until 1805, is now on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris
 is tasviir ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki portret main chitrit mahila italy ke ek dhani resham vyapaaree kii patni thi
 Beautiful river, tree and waterfall natural scenes are seen in the background of the picture
 aisa lagata he jaise studiyon main ek vishaal khuli hui khidki ke saamne baitaakar vishay ko chitrit kiya gaya he
 In 2007, French engineer Pascal Côté announced that his ultra-high resolution scan on the picture showed that Monalisa was actually painted with eyebrows but over time these colors were gone
 unhone iske peeche atyadhik safai ko ek sambhavit vajah mana
 Based on the documents obtained from the Florence where the painting began to be made in 1503, he states that Monalisa gave birth to an infant at the end of the same year
 ek italvi va america shodhakarta dwaara florence se praapt carch ke padri dwaara shishu ke namakaran kii dharmik rasm ke dastavejon ke hawaale se is baat kii pushti kii gai he
 Newland believes that Monalisa had made her portrait with the memory and research of the child in her stomach
 unka kathan he ki sansar main aane vaale naye jivan kaa romaanch va maatrutiv ko pulakit kar dene vaali prasannataa ke kaaran hi uske chehre par yah alaikik va adbhut muskaan he
 In another discovery, a teacher named Giuseve Pallati, a resident of Florence, made a revelation after scrutinizing all the city's ancient documents and records for 25 years, Lisa Gherardini was married in 1495 to Sir Francisco del Jacadain, a wealthy silk merchant
 san 1550 main purnajagaran kaaleen kalakaaron ke italy nivasee prasiddh jeevani lekhak georgio vasari dwaara resham vyapaaree kii patni lija gherardini kii tasviir ko mona lija naam diya gaya
 The word Mona in Italian is used for madam
 halaanki iske sadiyon baad tak bhi is kalakriti main chitrit is mahila ko uske anya prachlit naam lajiokande se bhi janaa jaataa rahaa he
 Like most of the art works of that time, the name of the woman giving the artist's signature, date and pose is not printed in this painting
 pallaanti ke anusaar liyanardo ke pita sar piyare va francisko ke ghar paraspar adhik duuri par nahin the, par donon hi pariwaron ke bich paraspar ghanishtha sambandh the
 At that time Lisa was 24 years old
 sadiyon se monalisa kii rahasyamay muskuraahat jahaan rahasy bani hui he vahiin german ke kala itihaaskaar sushri mike bogt-layaresan ne daawa kiya he ki tasviir main dikh rahi mahila italy ke arango praant ke diu kii patni ishabela he
 According to Ms
 Mike, Ishabella has a sad smile because her mother died shortly before Leonardo made the painting
 mike kii maane to ishabela kaa sharaabi pati nashe main dhut hokar use aksar martha-peethta tha
 In his published book 'who is Monalisa' Insarch has drawn many similarities
 pustak main aage likhaa he ki liyanardo jo ki diu ke darbar main shahi kalakaar the, isabela ke kaaphi nikat the
 About 8 years ago, a doctor of teeth in Japan surprised everyone by saying that the secret of Monalisa's mysterious smile is the break of the two front teeth in her upper jaw and that is why her upper lip was pressed on one side
 -this is visible, that is why one of his upper lips is seen as something suppressed from one side
 yahi kaaran he ki anjaane main monaalisa va rahasyamay muskaan dikhaai detii he jab ki vastav main yah muskaraahat nahin balki apane tut chuke daanton se khaali hue sthaan ko jeebh se hothon ko thelne kaa prayaas kar rahi he jisase hoth dabaa hua na dikhe
 This doctor had been doing research on Monalisa for many years

 In an article published in the journal Art and Antics, Ms
 Lillian claimed that she was stunned to see that Leonardo and Monalisa's faces, eyes, in 1518, when she placed a self-portrait of Leonardovinchi made of red chalk and a portrait of Monalisa
 There is a wonderful similarity between cheeks, nose and hair
 computer ke madad se jab monaalisa ke chehre ke upar liyanardo ke bal, dadhi va bhavahe lagaakar dekha gaya to vah puri tarah liyanardo main parivartit ho gai
 Conversely, if Lianardo's face is removed from his beard, hair, mustache, bhava, etc
, Leonardo turns into Monalisa
 sward ji kaa kathan he ki liyanardo ne monaalisa ke rup main swayan kaa nari chithran kiya he
 He cited the homosexuality of an artist as the main reason behind it
 is baat kii prabal sambhaavna he ki vinci samalangik ho or ubhay lingi vishyon ko kalakriti main dhaalane main ruchi rakhte ho tathaa apni isi pravitti ke chalate swayan ko nari rup main chitrit kar use monaalisa naam diya

 ye sanskaran ab tak chape upanyaas ke duusare sanskarnon se zyada padhaa gaya sanskaran mana jaataa he, haalanki 1818 ke hi mul vishay vaale sanskaran ab bhi chaape jate hai
 In fact, scholars prefer the 1818 edition, they argue that it keeps the spirit / spirit of Shelley's original revelation alive
 francnstin apane dwaara banaae gaye daitya se naakhush tha, is tathy se sthapit hota he ki usne use koi naam nahin diya or is vajah se uski koi pahchaan nahin thi
 Instead, Frankenstein used words like "monster", "monster", "rogue", "bastard" and "she" to refer to him
 jab 10wein adhyay main francnstin daitya se baatcheet karata he to vah use "ghinauna keedaa", "ghrunit daitya", "dusht", "kamina shaitan" or "ghrunit shaitan" jaise apshabdon se sambodhit karata he
 Speaking of Frankenstein, Shelley also addressed the monster by the name "adam"
 shelli ne edan kaa baghichaa main pehle insaan kaa hawala dete hue apane puralekh main kaha: The monster is often referred to as "frankenstein", which is absolutely wrong
 1908 main ek lekhak ne kaha tha "ye bahut ajeeb baat he ki "francnstin" shabd kaa istemaal duniyabar main galat tareeke se kiya jaataa he, isamen vidwaan log bhi shaamil hai, ye kisi bhayanak daitya kaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he

 12 june 1844 main da rover main prakashit david lindse ke "da bridal ornament" main "garib francnstin ke srujankarta" kaa zikr he
 After watching James Wells's famous film Frankenstein in 1931, the audience called the monster itself "frankenstein"
 This trend continued in Bride of Frankenstein and other films in the series, even misused in many film names, such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein
 meri shelli is baat par hameshaa kaayam rahi ki unhone ek sapana dekha tha jahaan se francnstin naam astitv main aayaa
 Despite his many claims about the genuineness of the name, it has been surrounded by many speculations and controversies
 vaastavik taur par german bhashaa main francnstin kaa arth he "franks kaa pathar"
 ye naam kai jagahon se judaa he, jaise ki kasal francnstin, jise upanyaas likhane se pehle meri shelli ne ek naav par yatra ke dauraan dekha tha
 Frankenstein is also the name of a town in the Palatinate region; And before 1946, a city named Zabkowice Slaski in Cilicia, Poland, was also known as Frankenstein in Shalesian
 haal main hi, radu floreshu ne apni kitaab in search of francnstin main daawa kiya ki meri or percy shelli ne switzaraland jate samay rin nadi ke kinare, darmstate sthit kasal francnstin kaa daura kiya tha, jahaan conrad dipal naam ke ek kukhyat kemiyagaar ne maanav sharir ke saath prayog kiye the, lekin meri shelli ne is yatra kaa zikr nahin kiya tha taaki asalipan kaa uskaa daawa kaayam rahe
 haal hi ke ek saahitiyik niabandh main e je de ne floreshu ke is daawey ko sahi tehraaya ki meri shelli kasal francnstin ke bare main jaanati he or apana upanyaas likhane se pehle vah vahaan gai thim
 de ne iske liye meri shelli ke "gum" hue dastavezon kaa hawala diya he jisamen kathith taur par francnstin kasal kaa zikr he
 Although some people do not accept this theory as correct; Frankenstein expert Leonard Wolf called it an "unconfirmed 


 conspiracy theory", according to him, that 'lost documents' and Florescu's claims cannot be corroborated
 jon milton ke mahakavy paradise lost kaa meri shelli par khaasaa prabhaav mana jaataa he 
 milton ne paradise lost main ishwar ko aksar "da victor" kahkar sambodhit kiya he or shelli ke liye victor bhagwaan kii tarah hi he kyonki vah bhi jivan kaa srijan karata he
 In addition, Shelley's description of the monster closely matches the character of Satan in Paradise Lost, and after reading this epic, the monster even goes so far as to say that he has a similarity with Satan's character in it
 victor or meri ke pati, percy shelli ke bich bhi kai samanthaayen hai
 Victor, nicknamed Percy Shelley, named the original Poetry by Victor and Czaire, a collection of poems written with his sister Elizabeth
 kayaas lagaae jate rahe hai ki victor francnstin ke charitra liye meri shelli ne percy ko adarsh mana tha, kyonki percy ne aton main "vidyut or chumbakeey shakti ke saath or barood evam duusare rasayanon ke saath kai prayog kiye the" or unke oxford main unke kamare vaigyanik upkarnon se bhare pade the
 Percy Shelley was the elder son of a wealthy vassal of high political reach and a descendant of the first subcontinent of Kasal Göring, Sir Biashi Shelley, and Richard Fitzalan, the 10th feudal of Erandal

 jab victor ne dekha kii daitya jivit ho uthaa he to vah cameraa chhodkar bhaag gaya, haalanki vah daitya us tarah victor kii ore badha tha jaise ki ek navjaat shishu apane mata-pita kii ore badhata he
 Victor's obligation to the monster is the main theme of this novel
 da mordan promethius upanyaas kaa upasheershak he 
 promethius, unani puranic kathaon ke mutabik, vah devtaa tha jisane maanav jati kaa srijan kiya
 It was Prometheus who stole fire from heaven and gave it to humans
 jab devataaon ke raja zeeyas ko yah baat pataa chali to unhone sazaa ke taur par promethius ko taumr ek chattan ke saath baandhakar rakh diya jahaan rose ek parabhakshi pakshi aakar uskaa kalejaa khaataa tha, lekin vah dobaaraa ug jaataa tha or pakshi agle din aakar use dobaaraa khaataa tha, ant main promethius ko heracals ne is bandhan se mukti dilaai
 Prometheus is also a legend told in Latin but the story is completely different
 is kahani main promethius mitti or pani se maanav kaa srijan karata he, jo francnstin main ek ahm vishay-vastu he kyonki victor bhi prakruti ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karata he or parinamswaroop uski rachana hi use sazaa detii he
 In Greek mythology of Prometheus, the deity is similar to Victor Frankenstein, just as Victor creates human beings in new ways, in the same way that deity also creates mankind
 ek tarah se victor nen bhagwaan se maanav srijan kaa rahasy chin liya thik vaise hi jaise ki devtaa ne swarg se aag churaakar maanav ko saunp di thi
 Both Victor and God are punished for their actions
 victor ko apane sage-sambandhiyon kii maut kii vajah se bahut ksht jhelana padataa he or use dar bhi sataata he ki uske dwaara kiya gaya srijan use maar daalega For Mary Shelley, Prometheus was not a hero but rather something like a devil, whom she blamed for giving fire to humans and due to which mankind got addicted to eating meat
 Mary's support for this claim is found in chapter 17 of the novel, where the "monster" tells Victor Frankenstein: "my food is not a man; i do not kill a lamb and a child for my stomach; for my nutrition
" Plum and banjuffal are enough
 " aam taur par romani daur ke kalakaaron ke liye, maanav ko promethius kaa tohfa 18veen sadi ke do mahaan avyavhaarik vaadon ko darshata he: audyogic kranti or francisi kranti, jisamen donon mahaan vaade or ankahe-ansune sakshat bhay maujuud the
 Byron had a strong attachment to Aeschylus' play Prometheus Bound and Percy Shelley was soon to write his Prometheus Unbound
 "mordan promethius" shabd emanuel kaint ne gadha tha, jisamen unhone benjamin franklin or us dauraan kiye gaye unke vidyutiya prayogon kaa zikr kiya tha
 Shelley incorporated many different sources into her novel, one of which was Ovid's Promethean legend
 jon milton ke paradise lost or samul tailor colerij ke "da rime of da anciant mariner ", vah kitaaben jo daitya ko cabin main milti hai, kaa asar upanyaas main saaf dekhne ko miltaa he
 The Shelley couple had also read William Thomas Beckford's gothic novel Vathek
 francnstin main meri shelli kii maa meri wolstoncraft kaa kai jagah zikr he or unki mukhya kitaab "a windication of da ritis of vuman " kaa bhi, jisamen purushon or mahilaon main samaan shiksha kii kami kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The inclusion of his mother's ideas in his work is also related to the creation of the novel and the theme of motherhood
 meri ne francnstin ke charitra ke liye hamphri davy kii kitaab eliments of chemical philosophy se shaayad kuch prerana bhi lee hogi jisamen davy ne likhaa he ki "vigyaan ne

 " shelli ne apane upanyaas kii ek vivechna kaa khud prasangvash ullekh kiya he, jab vah apane pita wiliam godwin kii ativaadee raajnneeti kaa hawala detii he
 At one point in Shelley's novel, the monster and Victor come face to face on a glacier
 daitya akelepan or bahishkrut hone kii apni bhaawanaaon kaa varnan karata he
 Victor is still unable to see that he had boycotted the monster and it was his responsibility to love that monster and give him some time, as his parents had done for him in childhood
 victor ko itnaa algaav kyon he? vah khud ko ek pita kii tarah kyon nahin dekhtaa? da nitemir of romantic aedialissam naamak niabandh main lekhak kahata he, "jab francnstin baap banataa he, vah bacchon ke prati apane kartavya ko aasaani se bhul jaataa he, ek srujankarta hote hue bhi usamen ek gun kii kami he or vah gun vah he uske liye vah apane mata-pita kii prashansa karata he: unhen is baat kaa bodh tha ki jise unhone janm diya he uske prati unka daayitv banataa he
 

 "this author also states that" by refusing to accept the role of an adult in life, he upholds the power of creation
 lekin usee ke saath-saath vah bilkul gaiyr-zimmedaar bhi he or usamen apane karmon ke parinaamon ko jhelane kii himmat nahin he
 "these sentences describe Victor's mindset towards his creation
 durbhagyavash, francnstin kaa komal bachapan use asli duniya ke liye taiyaar nahin kar paaya
 He never needed to take responsibility for his actions by increasing it
 Frankenstein tries to find the relationship between the creator and the creation, as well as the global need for love and acceptance of family and society
 victor dwaara apni rachana kaa bahishkaar karnaa daitya ko bahishkrut anubhav karaata he or us daitya ke andar gusse or khed kii bhaavana ko janm detaa he or hinsak pratikriya main vah un logon ko maar daalata he jo victor ke bahut kareebi the, yah silsilata ant tak chalata he jab victor khud mar jaataa he or daitya khud ko nasht karne ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 a popular theme of Frankenstein is the effects of loneliness and loneliness on humans
 yah vishay-vastu, upanyaas ke teen mukhya paatro: walton, francnstin or daitya, ke vichaaron or anubhavon ke zarie darshai gai he
 Walton's letters at the beginning of the story are filled with feelings of his loneliness as the adventure he embarked on left nothing interesting
 victor puri kitaab main dar or bechaini kaa anubhav karata he
 At the beginning of the story, Victor's actions separate him from his family
 vah kai varsh akelepan main bitaata he
 Later in the story his experiences become even more bitter when his family and friends start dying
 usne kaha he "yah manodasha mere us swasthya ko kha gai he, jo pehle jatke se bachane ke baad puri tarah thik ho gaya tha
 i had left the face of a human being; Every single voice of joy bites me; Solitude was my only support - dark darkness - silence like death "
 Frankenstein expressed similar sentiments when he said" indulging in one of the world's most disgusting pursuits, i was drowned in loneliness, where no one i could not lose my attention for a moment, my desires were dead, i was restless and nervous
 " daitya bataata he ki kis tarah uske akelaapan ne use badal diya jab vah kahata he "main yah vishwaas nahin kar saktaa ki main vahi hum jiske vichaar kabhi shreshth or uttam sundarataa or achchhai se bhare pade the
 But it is also that a fallen angel becomes a malicious devil
 phir bhi uske suunepan main bhagwaan or insaan ke us dushman ke dost the; lekin main phir bhi akelaa hum"
 shelli spasht rup se is vishya-vastu kaa anveshan kar rahi thi kyonki akelaapan uske mukhya charitron kii mahatvapurn prerana he
 In Nightmare: Birth of Horror, Christopher Frayling discusses the subject as opposed to the biochemistry expressed in the novel, as Shelley was a vegetarian
 tisare adhyay main victor likhte hai ki unhone "ajeev mitti main jaan foonkane ke liye jivit praani ko yatnaa di
" or daitya kahata he: "meraa bhojan manushya nahin he; main apane pet ke liye memne or bachche ko nahin martha
" Having a minority view, Arthur Bellefant claims in his book Frankenstein, The Man and the Monster that Mary Shelley intended readers to understand that the monster never existed, and that Victor Frankenstein committed all three murders Were
 unki is vivechna main, yah kahani victor ke naitik patan kaa adhyyan he or is kahani main vaigyanik pariklpana ke pahalu victor kii kalpana hai
 Another minority literary critic, John Loriston, claims in the 2007 book "the Man Who Rotated Frankenstein", in which he says that Mary's husband, Percy Biashi Shelley, was the author of the novel
 meri shelli ke pramukh vidwaan is anumaan ko zyada twajjo nahin dete hai, haalanki aalochak camilly paaglia ne isaki utsaahpurvak prashansa kii he or germaine greer ne isaki tikhi aalochana kii he
 Charles E
 Robinson, professor of English at the University of Delaware, lends some support to this disputed writing in his 2008 edition of Frankenstein, Robinson re-read Frankenstein's manuscripts, and recognized the help of Percy Shelley

 Sir Walter Scott wrote that "above all, we found this work impressive because it reflected the author's genuine dexterity and pleasant power to express", although most critics considered it "a terrible and hideous utterance of absurdity"
 is tarah kii samalochanaon ke baavjood, francnstin ne bahut jald hi prasiddhi hasil kar lee
 kai naatakon or rangamanchon dwaara apanaae jane ke baad yah or bhi mashhoor ho gaya — meri shelli ne 1823 main richard brincele peak ke naatak prismpashan: or da phet of francnstin, ko bhi dekha
 francnstin kaa francisi anuwaad 1821 main hi prakashit kar diya gaya Since the anonymous publication in 1818, Frankenstein has received much praise and criticism
 The reviews by critics of the time reflect these two views
 da bele essembly ne upanyaas ko "nirbhik pariklpana" qaraar diya
 quarterli rivyuu ne kaha ki "lekhak ke paas kalpana or bhashaa donon kii shakti he"
 sar walter scot, ne blackwood ediberg magazine main likhte hue badhai di, "lekhak kii vaastavik nipunata or vyakt karne kii khushnuma shakti", haalanki jis tarah se daitya ne duniya or bhashaa kaa gyaan hasil kiya usase vah kam sahamat the
 The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany hoped that "he would like more novels by this author"
 do anya samikshaon main jahaan yah maaloom padataa he ki lekhak wiliam godwin kii beti he, upanyaas kii aalochana meri shelli ke striyochit swabhaav par hamalaa he
 The British critic described the shortcomings of the novel as the author's fault; "its author, according to us, is a woman, this is her anger, and this is the biggest mistake of this novel; but if that writer forgets about the beauty of her gender, we see no reason why; and We therefore dismiss this novel without further comment
 "
 da litrery panorama or neshnal register ne upanyaas par hamalaa bolte hue ise "ek mashhoor upanyaaskaar kii beti" dwaara likhit "mistar godwin ke upanyaason kii nakal" qaraar dayaa
 Despite these initial rejections, the novel has been well received by critics since the mid-20th century

 Today, this novel is generally considered a historical work of romantic and Gothic literature and scientific hypothesis
 aaj kii lokapriy pagal vaigyanik shelli main meri style ke francnstin ko pehla upanyaas kaha jaataa he
 However the prevailing culture has transformed the naive and simple Victor Frankenstein into a very evil character
 jaisaa daitya ko pehle pesh kiya gaya tha, usase bilkul alag isane daitya ko bhi ek sansanikhez, ammanushik praani main badal diya he
 The worst thing Victor does in the real story is to ignore the monster in fear
 He does not want to create fear
 The monster also comes into existence like an innocent, beloved creature
 jab duniya us par atyaachaar karti he to uske man main dwesh kii bhaavana panapati he
 Finally, Victor describes science knowledge as the devil and dangerously attractive
 haalanki kitaab prakashit hone ke turant baad, rangamanch nirdeshkon ko is kahani ko drishyon main pesh karne main kathinaayee mahasoos hone lagi
 1823 main shuru hue pradarshnon ke dauraan naatakkaar yah baat maanane lage ki is upanyaas ko rangamanch par pesh karne ke liye vaigyanik or daitya ke antarbhaavon ke khatm karnaa padegaa

 At the same time, Victor was introduced as an idiot who was only involved in the secrets of nature

 In this film, the scientist is an egotistical, promising, adult, not a young man
 The second scientist in the film voluntarily kills the monster, but the film never pressures Frankenstein to take responsibility for his actions

 cementics yah pataa lagaataa he ki arth-grahan kaa yah antar paidaa karne main bhashaa kaise kaam karti he
 The strange thing is that initially philologists rather than deep on economics
 saath ke dashak se bhashavidon ne bhashaai arthon ke do buniyadi prakaaron ko rekhaankit karnaa shuru kiya
 It is believed that the first type of meaning is congenial in linguistic form
 duusari kism kaa taalluk us rup ke bole jane or us abhivyakti ke sandarbh ke bich anyonyakriya se hota he
 k has been interpreted under differentiation of three
 inamen pehla he bodh or sandarbh ke bich kaa antar
 The second is the difference between the meaning of the word and the meaning of the sentence
 teesraa he paath or sandarbh ke bich kaa antar
 This third difference is now separated from cementics by linguists as a new discipline in the form of pragmatics
 cementics ke tahat jis bhashaa kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he use lakshya-bhashaa kii sangya di jaati he or jis bhashaa main uski vyakhya kii jaati he use metaalenguage kehete hai
 a target language may play the metalinguistic role of its interpretation
 bhashaa-shaastra ke itihaas main arth-grahan sambandhi kavayaden pehle shabd-kendrit thim, phir ve vaakya-kendrit huin or phir ve paath- kendrit ho gayin
 These three processes have influenced the disciplines of media-study, literature, interpretive sociology and cognitive science
 cementics prashn uthaata he ki kisi shabd ke arth kii shinaakht bhashaa ke daayre ke bheetar hi kii jaae yaa arth-nirupan ke liye uske bahari daayre se bhi madad lee jaae
 For example, we know the meaning of chair, but how do we get this meaning? We can say that he sits on a chair
 par, bhashaa ke bheetar kursi kaa arth furniture, mez, seat yaa bench jaise anya arthon sahit uske sambandh ke saath bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The meaning of the chair used to sit with these words is different
 bodh or sandarbh ke bich antar kaa ek or udhaaharan shukr grah yaa venus he
 It is also called the morning star and evening star, because its brightness is visible in the morning and also in the night
 is tarah shukr, bhor kaa tara or sandhya-tara ek hi chiz ke teen naam hai
 But despite the context being the same, all three are used for different realizations
 cementics kaa jor sandarbh par kam or bodh par adhik rahata chunki arth-grahan ke hi chahta he, isliye vah nateeja nikalataa he ki yatharth kii samaj bhi bhashaa ke zariye hi hasil ho sakati he or uske liye samskruti, itihaas or anya bhautik prakriyaaon kaa koi mahatva nahin he
 Cementics uses three main relations synonyms, antonyms, and hyponomicals to achieve semantics within the language
 hyponanimakal shrenee ve aate jinke main shabd abhivyaktiyaan bhi shaamil hoti hai
 For example, a dog is also an animal like a cat, monkey, giraffe or rabbit and can also be a terrier, hound, German Shepherd or retriever
 dhyaan dene ke baat yah he ki ye teenon rup kisi suparibhaashit bhashaai pranali ke bheetar arth rachane ke kaam zarur aate hai, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki arth-grahan or arth- rachana kii saamaajik or saamudayik prakriyaayein bhi unki mohataaj hoti hon
 For example, there can also be a community that constructs the meaning of words without these three relations, that is, outside the realm of language
 uttar america main hopi ek aisa he pakshiyon chhod sabhi vaali chizon ke liye alag-alag ke bajaay ek hi shabd kaa istemaal hota he
 The people of this clan give the name 'masayataka' to a mosquito, balloon and plane or something similar
 vaakyon ke madhyam se shabdaarth grahan karnaa bhi cementics ke daayre main aata he
 'ramesh bought house from Umesh' is actually synonymous with 'umesh sold house to Ramesh'
 isi tarah kaa samanarthak sambandh ‘police ne andolankariyon ko girakrataar kar liya’ kaa ‘andolankaaree police dwaara girakrataar kar liye gayi’ ke bich he
 Similarly, other meanings are formed between sentences
 udhaaharan ke liye ‘america commando unit ke haathon osama bin laden maaraa gaya’ or ‘osama bin laden maaraa gaya’ ke bich kaa arth-sambandh dekha ja saktaa he
 If according to the first sentence, the US commando unit has actually killed Osama, then the second sentence also wants to represent the reality that will be accepted as true
 arth ke lihaaz se ek vaakya kii duusare par nirbharta ke saath- saath vaakya apane arth ke liye usamen antarnihit purv-manyata par bhi nirbhar karte hai
 Such as: 'according to a statement of the Ministry of Defense, India should exercise the powers to prevent Pakistan from promoting cross-border terrorism'
 is vaakya main do purv- manyataayen nihit hai : pehali, bharat ke paas aavashyak shaktiyaan hai or duusari, pakistan seemaa-paar aatankwaad ko protsaahit kar rahaa he
 In the last ten years, there has been tremendous linguistic work in the fields of Cementics and Pragmatics
 vaakyon or shabdon ke arthon ke bich antar karne vaali ye cementic kavayaden upar se dekhne main bahut maamuli lag sakati hai, par kisi ibaarat main antarnihit vichaardhaaratmak taatparyon or daavedaariyon ko saamne laane ke liye inaki ahmiyat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Economic changes can also be studied in several terms of political science by taking the help of cementics and pragmatics
 masalan, loktantr kaa arth arestu ke jamaane se lekar kaafii dinon tak saadhaaran logon yaa unki bheed ke tantra yani avyavasthit or arajak pranali ke rup main lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 But today democracy has become rigid in the sense of a working system according to a systematic procedure
 isliye jaise hi koi maang yaa andolan kii prakriyaaon sidhe hastkshep kii maang karata he, use vyavastha ke liye khatara qaraar diya jane lagata he
 The entire revolution movement under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan in India created similar economic anxiety by demanding the right of representative return
 anna hajaare ke netritv main chale bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ne bhi loktantr se judi arth-sambandhi samasyaon ko pesh kiya he
 Now it is the job of philosophers and thinkers of democracy to make an economical explanation of this change in the meaning of democracy
