 The medium of communication in India is television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and inter-page pages etc

 pehle daur kii neenv unnisvin sadi main us samay padi jab aupniveshik aadhuniktaa ke sansarg or aupniveshik hukumat ke kilaaf asantosh kii antarvirohi chaaya main hamaare saarvajanik jivan kii ruparekha ban rahi thi
 In this process, the media was divided into two poles
 uskaa ek hissaa aupniveshik shashan kaa samarthak niklaa, or duusare hisse ne swatantraaa kaa jhandaa buland karne waalon kaa saath diya
 This period of nationalism versus colonialism continued till 1947
 is bich angrezi ke saath-saath bhartiya bhashaaon main patr-patrikaon ke prakaashan kii samrudh parampara padi or angrezon ke niyantran main radio-prasaaran kii shuruyaat hui
 The second round began with independence and lasted until the eighties
 is lambi avadhi main media ke prasar or gunvattta main jabardast badhotaree hui
 Its various forms were seen participating in the grand project of bringing the All India Consent to earth, built around the goal of making India a modern nation-state
 isi daur main tivi kaa aagaman hua
 Printed media was mainly in the hands of the private sector, and the government controlled the radio-tv
 nabbe ke dashak main bhoomandaleekaran ke aagaman ke saath tisare daur kii shuruyaat hui jo aaj tak jari he
 It was a time of radical change in the prevailing idiom of nation-building and mass-politics, which led to huge changes in the appearance and trends of the media
 tivi or radio par sarkari jakad dhili padi
 In the private sector, 24-hour satellite television channels and FM radio channels spread very rapidly
 badhati hui sakshartaa or nirantar jari aadhunikeekaran ke tahat bhartiya bhashaaon ke media ne angrezi-media ko prasar or lokapriyata main bahut peeche chhod diya
 The overall size of the media increased unprecedentedly
 nayi media praudyogikiyon kaa istemaal karne vaale logon kii sankhya main jabardast badhotaree hui
 Within just ten years, India has also become almost the same situation in the West which is called 'mediasphere'
 bharat main media ke vikaas ke pehle charan ko teen hisson main baant kar samajha ja saktaa he
 In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries Christian missionaries brought printing presses to India to publish religious literature
 bharat kaa pehla akhbaar bengal gazat bhi 29 janvari 1780 ko ek angrez james augustus hiki ne nikaala
 Since Hickey expressed the contradictions of the British community in India in sarcastic language through this weekly, he was soon arrested and the publication of the newspaper ceased in two years
 hiki ke baad kisi angrez ne aupniveshik hiton par chot karne vaala prakaashan nahin kiya
 In the second decade of the nineteenth century, the missionaries of Srirampur near Calcutta and in the third decade Raja Rammohan Roy started publishing weekly, monthly and bi-monthly magazines
 patrakarita ke zariye yah do drushtikonon kaa takaraav tha
 Srirampur's missionaries wanted to establish the superiority of Christianity, proving Indian tradition inferior, while Raja Rammohun Roy's role was that of an internal critic of Hinduism and Indian society
 ve parampara ke un roopon kii aalochana kar rahe the jo aadhuniktaa ke prati sahaj nahin the
 At the same time, Raja Rammohan was also trying to establish a new religion by combining the useful dimensions of the tradition with Christian inspiration
 is avadhi main media kii sarawastu par dharmik prashnon or samaaj sudhaar ke agrahon se sambandhit vishleshan or bahasein haaavee raheen
 This bi-polar character of the media, expressed on the question of social reform, later developed into a clear contradiction of colonial versus national and persisted until the transfer of power in 1947
 tees ke dashak tak angrezi ke aise akhbaaron kii sankhya badhati rahi jinka uddeshy angrezon ke shashan kii tarafadaari karnaa tha
 Their ownership was also in the hands of the British
 1861 main bombay ke teen akhbaaron kaa vilay karke times of india kii sthapana bhi british hiton kii seva karne ke liye robert nite ne kii thi
 In 1849, Girish Chandra Ghosh brought out the first newspaper known as the first Bengal Recorder which was owned by Indian hands
 1853 main iskaa naam badal kar 'hindu patriot' ho gaya
 This paper, which came out in the mighty edict of Harishchandra Mukherjee, heralded the tradition of severe criticism of the British Government on various questions
 sadi ke ant tak ek taraf to upniveshwaad virdohi rashtriya netritv kaa aadhaar ban chukaa tha, or duusari ore swadhinata kii kaamana kaa sanchaar karne ke liye saare desh main vibhinn bhashaaon main patr-patrikaon kaa prakaashan hone laga tha
 The journalism of Indian languages did not fail to take the British rule
 isi kaaran 1878 main angrezon ne varnakular press act banaaya taaki apni aalochana karne vaale press kaa munh band kar saken
 It was fiercely opposed in India and Britain
 1885 main bhartiya rashtriya congress kaa gathan hua jisaki gatividhiyaan uttarottar mukhar rashtrawaad kii taraf jhukati chali gayin
 The press of the Indian languages also developed their own with the same trend
 media ke lihaaz se beesvin sadi ko ek ullekhneey viraasat mili jiske tahat tilak, gokhale, dadabhai nauroji, surendranath banerjee, madanamohan malviya or rabindranath thakur ke netritv main akhbaaron or patrikaon kaa prakaashan ho rahaa tha
 In the twenties, the Congress turned into a mass movement under Gandhi's direction
 swayan gandhi ne rashtriya patrakarita main teen-teen akhbaar nikaal kar yogadan diya
 But there was another pole of this development
 agar in rashtriya hastiyon ke netritv main maratha, kesari, bengali, harijan, navajivan, yang india, amrit bazaar patrika, hindustani, edwocket, tribune, akhbaar-e-aam, sadhana, prabasi, hindustan rivyuu, rivyuu or abhyuday jaise prakaashan upniveshwaad virdohi tarkon or swadhinata ke vichaar ko apana aadhaar bana rahe the, to kalakatta kaa statsman, bombay kaa times of india, madras kaa mail, lahore kaa civil and military gazat or elahabaad kaa pyniyar khule taur par angrezi shashan ke gun gane main vishwaas karata tha
 This dichotomy of media-culture grew further on linguistic basis
 rashtriya bhaawanaaon kaa paksh lene vaale angrezi ke akhbaaron kii sankhya gini-chuni hi rah gayi
 The rest of the English newspapers became the puppets of the British
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke akhbaaron ne khul kar upniveshvadvirohi awaz uthaani shuru kar di
 The level of salary and facilities of journalists of pro-british newspapers was much better than the salary of journalists working in Indian language publications
 british samarthak akhbaaron ko khub vigyaapan milte the or unke liye sansadhano kii koi kami na thi
 The capital-base of anti-colonial newspapers was weak
 baharhaal, angrezi patrakarita ke mahatva ko dekhte hue jaldi hi malviya, mohammad ali, eni besent, motilal nehru aadi ne rashtravaadi vichaaron vaale angrezi akhbaaron kii shuruyaat kii
 Indian capitalist Ghanshyam Das Birla, who supported the Congress from Delhi in 1923, started publishing The Hindustan Times
 1938 main jawaharlal nehru ne angrezi ke rashtravaadi akhbaar naishanal harold kii sthapana kii
 In 1826, Jugal Kishore Sukul from Calcutta published the first Hindi newspaper called Udant Martand
 hindi media ne apni daavedaari beesvin sadi ke purvardh main pesh kii jab ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee ne pratap, balmukund gupt or ambika sharan vaajapeyi ne bharat mitra, maheshachandra agarwal ne vishwamitra or shivaprasad gupt ne aaj kii sthapana kii
 In a way, it was the beginning of Hindi-press
 isi dauraan urdu-press kii neenv padi
 Abul Kalam Azad began publication of al-hilal and al-bilagh, Muhammad Ali of Hamdard
 lakhanu se hakeekat, lahore se pratap or milaap or dilli se tej kaa prakaashan hone laga
 In Bangla, publications like Sandhya, Nayak, Basumati, Hitabadi, Nabashakti, Anand Bazaar Patrika, Jugantar, Krishak and Nabjug were participating in the anti-colonial campaign from their respective perspectives
 marathi main induprakash, navkaal, navshakti or lokmaanya ; gujarati main gujarati panch, sevak, gujarati or samachar, vandemaataram; dakshin bharat main malayala manorama, mathrubhumi, swaraj, al-amin, malayala rajyam, deshabhimani, sanyukt karnataka, andhra patrika, kalki, tanti, swadeshmitram, deshbhaktam or dinamani yahi bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 a question may arise here in which ways was this national media national? There is no doubt that all these journals were against the British rule, but they had the same differences between the Congress and other political forces as to the condition and direction of the anti-colonial movement
 british prashasan ne 1924 main madras main ek shaukia radio club banane kii anumati di
 Three years later the private sector broadcast company started regular radio broadcasts in Bombay and Calcutta
 lekin saath main shaukia radio club bhi chalate rahe
 Observers believe that just as these amateur clubs forced the British to set up radio, in the nineties, due to private cable operators, the government had to allow partial privatization of television
 baharhaal, aupniveshik sarkaar ne 1930 main broadcasting ko apane haath main le liya or 1936 main uskaa namakaran ‘aal india radio’ yaa ‘akashwani’ kar diya gaya
 Broadcasting was also commissioned in native princely states like Hyderabad, Travancore, Mysore, Vadodara, Trivandrum and Aurangabad
 radio puri tarah se angrez sarkaar ke prachaartantr kaa ang tha
 Institutional regulatory measures such as censorship, advisory boards and departmental surveillance ensured that a word from the radio was not broadcast in favor of anti-colonial politics
 dilachasp baat yah he ki yah angrezi viraasat bharat ke azaad hone ke baad bhi jari rahi
 After the British, All India Radio was retained by the Government of India until AIR became an autonomous organization in 1997
 chunki bhartiya media ke donon dhruvon ne upniveshwaad virdohi sangharsh ke paksh yaa vipaksh main rah kar hi apni pahchaan banaayi thi, isliye swaabhaavik rup se raajnneeti uskaa kendriya sarokaar banati chali gayi
 As soon as the transfer of power took place on 15 August 1947 and the British began to cover their baggage to leave India, the relationship between the media and the government changed radically
 ek taraf to angrezon dwaara lagaayi gayi paabandiyaan prabhavi nahin rah gayin, or duusari taraf british shashan kii pairokari karne vaale zyaadaatar akhbaaron kaa swaamitv bharatiyon ke haath main chal gaya
 But even more important was that the media began to build a modern Indian nation, shoulder to shoulder with the political leadership
 media ke vikaas kaa yah doosraa charan assi ke dashak tak jari rahaa
 There were four notable dimensions of this long period: swatantra bharat main sarkaar ko giraane yaa badnaam karne main press ne koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 But at the same time he was not ready to be the coffin of power
 uskaa ravaiya radio or tivi se alag tarah kaa tha
 The radio-broadcasting 'akashvani' was entirely in the hands of the government
 1959 main ‘shikshatmak uddeshyon’ se shuru hue television kii programing kii zimmedaari bhi radio ko thama di gayi thi
 In contrast, the press, developed from the very beginning of private sector ownership, repeatedly saw the government, the ruling Congress, the opposition parties and the bureaucracy as a test of self-defined nation-interest
 yah prakriya use vyavastha kaa ang ban kar uski aantarik aalochana karne vaali satark agency kii bhoomika main le gayi
 Some scholars of the Indian media have also admitted that the press support given to the government after the British was a 'cautious support'
 press ne ‘raashtra-hit’ kii ek sarvamaanya paribhaasha taiyaar kii jise manwaane ke liye na koi meeting kii gayi or na hi koi dastauez paarit kiya gaya
 But there was no disagreement about the structure on which the emerging nation-state would stand, its character should be democratic and secular
 usne yah bhi maan liya tha ki aisa karne ke liye utpeedit saamaajik tabakon or samudaayon kaa lagaataar sabalikaran anivaary he
 Press-owners, managers and prominent journalists also believed in their own way that poverty would have to be transformed into prosperity in order to achieve this goal, which goes through developmental economics and mixed economy
 swatantra bharat kii videsh niti ke prati bhi media ne sakaaratmak sahmati darj karaayi
 On the other hand, the government on its part started to create an institutional framework to regulate the functioning of the press
 1952 or 1977 main do press ayog gathit kiye gayi
 In 1965, a constitutional body Press Council was established
 1956 main 'registration of books act' ke tahat press register of india kii sthapana kii gayi
 The measures to limit the freedom of the press could be seen in these measures, but the press did not object to these steps
 use yakeen tha ki sarkaar kisi bhi paristhiti main samvidhan ke anuchhed 19 ke tahat milane vaali abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii guarantee kaa ulanghan nahin karegi
 Despite the explicit mention in the constitution, the Supreme Court accepted the freedom of the press to be included in this guarantee
 lekin press kaa yah yakeen 1975 main tut gaya jab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne apane raajnneetik sankat se ubarne ke liye desh par aantarik apatkaal thope diya
 As a result, civil rights were granted, free expression and the press were banned
 253 patrkaar nazarband kiye gayi, saat videshi samvaadadaata nishkasit kar diye gayi, sensorship thopi gayi or press parishad bhang kar di gayi
 The Indian press could not resist this attack on itself as much as it should
 kintu kuch ne sarkaar ke saamne ghutane tech diye, par kuch ne nuksaan sah kar bhi apatkaal kii paabandiyon kaa pratirodh kiya
 Nineteen months later, this emergency was defeated by the test of election, but for the first time due to this setback the Indian press felt the need to fight for their freedom
 raashtra-nirmaan kii prakriya main hissedari karne kii uski bhoomika pehle se bhi adhik ‘satark’ ho gayi
 The watchful eye of the journalists observed that even after the defeat of the Emergency, the tendency to cut the freedom of the press in the political and power establishment has not stopped
 iske baad assi kaa dashak abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii raksha karne ke liye chalaaye gayi sangharshon kaa dashak sabit hua
 The Bihar Press Bill in 1982 and the defamation bill passed by the Lok Sabha in 1988 failed to convert the law into law due to agitations by journalists
 duusari taraf indira gandhi kii sarkaar dwaara express samachar-patr samooh ko sataane ke liye chalaaye gayi abhiyaan se yah bhi saafe hua ki kisi akhbaar dwaara kiye ja rahe virodh ko dabaane ke liye kanoon badalane ke bajaay satta kaa thodaa sa durupyog hi kaafii he
 As a result of the popular struggle against the Emergency, the process of politicization in the whole country was faster than before
 loktantr or uski anivaaryta ke prati nayi jaagrukta ne akhbaaron kii taraf naye pathakon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 These new readers were the product of increasing literacy
 badhati hui prasar sankhyaon ke falswaroop mudrit media kaa drushtikon vyavsaayik or bazaronmukh hua
 New printing technology was added at the same time as a happy coincidence with politicalization, literacy and professionalism
 dex-top publicing system or computer aadhaarit dizining ne akhbaaron or patrikaon ke prastutikaran main nayaa aakarshan paidaa kar diya
 This process increased revenue from advertising
 assi ke dashak ke dauraan hue in parivartanon main sabase mahatvapurn tha bhashaai patrakarita kaa vikaas
 Newspapers in Hindi, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bangla, Assamese and South Indian languages benefited the most from this new situation
 assi kaa dashak in bhashaai kshetron main naye patrakaron ke udai kaa dashak bhi tha
 After this development, linguistic journalism did not look back again
 nayi sadi main rashtriya pathak surveykshan ke aankadon ne bataaya ki ab angrezi press ke haathon main media kii lagaam nahin rah gayi he
 In the first ten newspapers with the highest circulation numbers, only one letter in English remained, that too from second to bottom
 assi ke dashak main hi prasaaran-media ke liye ek seemaa tak sarkari niyantran se mukt hone kii paristhitiyaan baniin
 Speaking in the Constituent Assembly in 1948, Jawaharlal Nehru promised that the structure of broadcasting in independent India would be on the lines of the British Broadcasting Corporation
 yah aashwaasan puraa karne main swatantra bharat kii sarkaron ko puure 42 saal lag gayi
 The policy behind this was to use radio and TV for government-directed political-social change
 is niti ke prabhaav main radio kaa to ek madhyam ke rup main thodaa-bahut vikaas hua, par tivi aage nahin bad paaya
 It was enough that in 1975-76, the Indian Space Research Organization borrowed a satellite from the US to broadcast programs in 2,400 villages in different parts of the country
 ise 'satellite instrectional television experement' kaha gaya
 Its success opened up the possibilities of producing and airing TV programs in various languages
 phir 1982 main dilli asiad kaa prasaaran karne ke liye rangeen tivi kii shuruyaat hui
 This increased the speed of broadcasting TV
 1990 tak uske transmitaron kii sankhya 519 or 1997 tak 900 ho gayi
 In the context of creating an autonomous corporation like the BBC, by 1966 only such progress had been made that former Controller General of India A
K
 The committee formed under the leadership of Chanda recommended formation of Akashvani and Doordarshan as two autonomous corporations
 baarah saal tak yah sifaarish bhi thande baste main padi rahi
 In 1978, B
G
 a working group constituted under the chairmanship of Varghese suggested to set up an organization called ‘akash Bharti’
 saal bhaar baad may, 1979 main prasar bharti naamak corporation banane kaa vidheyak sansad main laayaa gaya jiske tahat akashwani or doordarshan ko kaam karnaa tha
 Provision of lesser rights was made for the proposed corporation as compared to Akash Bharti suggested by the Varghese Committee
 jo bhi ho, janata party kii sarkaar gir jane ke kaaran yah vidheyak paarit nahin ho paaya
 From 1985 to 1988, Doordarshan got a slight stroke of freedom
 iskaa shrey bhartiya prashasnic seva ke adhikari bhaskar ghosh ko jaataa he jo is dauraan doordarshan ke mahanideshak rahe
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh's National Front government fulfilled the responsibility of passing the Prasar Bharati Bill in 1990
 lekin prasar bharti gathit hote-hote saat saal or guzar gayi
 Technically it can be said that today Doordarshan and All India Radio have become autonomous
 lekin hakeekat main soochna or prasaaran mantralay kaa ek atirikt sachiv hi prasar bharti kaa mukhya kaaryakari adhikari hota he
 If it is autonomy, then very limited
 nabbe ke dashak main kadam rakhane ke saath hi bhartiya media ko bahut badi had tak badali hui duniya kaa saakshaatkaar karnaa padaa
 At the heart of this change were three events of 1990–91: politics emanating from the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, politics of the temple movement and economic reforms under globalization
 in teenon ne mil kar saarvajanik jivan ke vamonmukh rujhaanon ko nepathy main dhakel diya or dakshinpanthi lehza manch par aa gaya
 This was the moment when the government started adopting a policy of 'open sky' in the field of broadcasting
 nabbe ke dashak main usne na keval prasar bharti nigam bana kar akashwani or doordarshan ko ek had tak swaittata di, balki swadeshi nijee poonji or videshi poonji ko prasaaran ke kshetra main kadam rakhane kii anumati bhi di
 It took him some time to open the way for foreign capital to enter the print media, but he also took this decision in the first decade of the twenty-first century
 media ab pehle kii tarah ‘single-sector’ yani mudran-pradhan nahin rah gaya
 Due to the consumer revolution, revenue from advertising increased manifold, so that there was no lack of capital for expansion for all types of media
 satellite tivi pehle cabile tivi ke madhyam se darshakon tak pahunchaa jo praudyogiki or udhyamshiltaa kii drushti se sthaneey pahalakadami or pratibha kaa asaadhaaran namoona tha
 Then came DTH technology which completely changed the world of news broadcasting and entertainment
 echem radio channelon kii kamyaabi se radio kaa madhyam motor vaahanon se aakraant nagar samskruti kaa ek paryaay ban gaya
 The Internet was introduced in India in 1995 and by the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, a significant part of the private and professional lives of a large number of people began to be processed through the net
 nayi media praudyogikiyon ne apane upabhoktaaon ko ‘canavargence’ kaa uphaar diya jo jaadu kii dibiya kii tarah haath main thame mobile phone ke zariye un tak pahunchne laga
 All these aspects together made the scope of the media so big and diverse that most of the dimensions of public life came under his fire
 ise ‘mediaswere’ jaisi sthiti kaa naam diya gaya
 The first effect of allowing foreign capital in print media was that foreign media organizations such as Reuter, cnyen and BBC started to get attracted towards Indian mediasphere
 unhone dekha ki bharat main shram kaa bazaar bahut sasta he or antarashtriya maanakon ke mukaable yahan vetan par adhik se adhik ek-chauthai hi karch karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, these global institutions made India the center of outsourcing for their media projects
 The huge and extraordinary talent pool of media in the Indian market began to be exploited for the global market
 duusari taraf bharat kii pramukh media companiyaan waal street jaranal, bibisi, financiel times, independent news and media or australian prakashnon ke saath sahyog-samjhaute karti nazar aayin
 The media business, based on the house-run companies, started going to the capital market and started issuing their initial public offerings ie IPO offers
 inaki shuruyaat pehle enditivi, tivi today, zee telefilms jaise drishy-media ne kii
 On the lines of electronic media, print-media too jumped into the capital market and began to seek investment for its expansion
 aisa pehla prayaas ‘da dekan chronical’ ne kiya jisaki safalataa ne print-media ke liye poonji kaa sankat kaafii-kuch hal kar diya
 On the other hand, the growing influence of marketism and the rise in consumer revolution resulted in a quadruple increase in advertising day and night
 chalis ke dashak kii shuruyaat main vigyaapan agenciyon kii sankhya chaudaa se bees ke aas-paas rahi hogi
 In 1979–80, the number of accredited agencies of the Newspaper Society had increased to only 168
 lekin, bhoomandaleekaran kii prakriya ne agle do dashakon main unki sankhya 750 kar di jo chaar sau karod rupee salanaa kaa dhandha kar rahi thim
 In 1997-98, the largest fifteen advertising agencies cut bills totaling Rs 4,105
58 crore
 isse anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki upabhokta-kranti kaa chakkaa kitni tezi se gum rahaa tha
 Riding on the colorful and seductive winds of advertising, the messages of consumption spread far and wide took the happy and ambitious part of the upper class, upper-middle class, entire middle class and working class in their arms
 media kaa vistaar vigyapanon main hui jabardast badhotaree ke bina sambhav nahin tha
 Print-media and radio advertisements could never be as effective as television
 tivi kaa prasar bharat main der se avashya hua, lekin ek baar shuruyaat hone par usne media kii duniya main pehle se sthapit mudrit-madhyam ko jaldi hi vyavsaayik rup se asurakshagrast kar diya
 It is necessary to mention the contribution of cables and DTH in this process
 cabile tivi kaa prasar or safalataa bharatiyon kii udhyami pratibha kaa zordaar namoona he
 Since the government lacked a coherent communications policy, some enthusiastic and shrewd people in middle-class and lower-middle-class populations living in multi-storey buildings in the early nineties managed to manage close-circuit television broadcasts on their own initiative There used to be a central control room
 in logon ne video playeron ke zariye bhartiya or videshi filmein dikhaane kii shuruyaat kii
 At the same time, viewers were also able to watch foreign-domestic satellite channels giving a round-the-clock dose of entertainment
 janvari, 1992 main cabile network ke paas keval 41 lakh graahak the
 But within four years only in 1996, this number reached ninety two lakhs
 agle saal tak puure desh main tivi vaale gharon main se 31 pratishat gharon main cabile prasaaran dekha ja rahaa tha
 By the end of the century the cable had reached TV audiences in large-sized villages and towns
 cabile or upgrahiy tivi channelon kii lokapriyata dekh kar pramukh media companiyon ne tivi kaarykram-nirmaan ke vyapaar main chalaang laga di
 He started supplying programs to public and private TV channels
 spasht he ki cabile or dit ke kadam tabhi jam sakate the, jab pehle public or privet television prasaaran main hui vruddhi ne zamin bana di ho
 In 1982, the number of TV transmitters in India increased rapidly as soon as color TV moved through the Delhi Asiad
 public tivi ke prasaaran network doordarshan ne nau sau transmitaron or teen vibhinn satelliton kii madad se desh ke 70 pratishat bhugolic kshetra ko or 87 % aabaadi ko apane daayre main le liya 
 Its main channel dd-one started claiming to reach 300 million people
 privet tivi prasaaran cabile or dit ke dwaara apni pahunch lagaataar badha rahaa he
 Almost all global TV networks are expanding their broadcasts on their own force or with local partners
 bhartiya channel bhi peeche nahin hai or unke saath raat-din pratiyogita main lage hue hai
 The popularity and commercial success of English and Hindi channels as well as regional language entertainment and news channels are also notable
 sarkaar kii doorsanchaar niti in media companiyon ko ijazat detii he ki ve satellite ke saath sidhe aplinking karke prasaaran kar sakate hai
 Now they do not have to face the compulsion to bring their material through the way of Foreign Communication Corporation

 These bourgeoisie had to withstand the wrath of critics for many years and Henry Bacon, a friend of Dr
 Cassatt's, felt that these rites were so fanatical as if they were "suffering from some unknown disease of the eye"
 She already had a female member, artist Berthe Morisot, who became Cassatt's friend and collaborator

 During the intervening two years, his style had gained a new ease

 In 1877, Cassatt's mother and father arrived in Paris, who had returned with his sister Lydia
 mairi ko, unka saath mahatvapurn laga kyunki na to vah or na hi lidia shaadishuda thi
 He had decided long before in life that marriage would be incompatible with his career

 Degas had a great influence on Kasat

 Degas also introduced him to Etching, in which he was a recognized master
 donon ne thodi der ke liye saath saath kaam kiya or degas ke sangrakshan main unki kaaryadakshata ko kaaphi takat mili
 Degas portrayed him in a series of etchings, recording his journey to the Louvre
 He had a lot of feelings for Degas, but learned not to expect too much from his playful and excited nature
 The magnificent and well-dressed Degas, forty five years old, was a special guest for dinner at Kasat's residence

 Cassatt exhibited eleven works including 'la Loge'
 Although critics said his colors were too bright and his portraits were so perfect that people looked flattering, his work was not as rude as Monet's work, whose condition at the time k was the most disappointing of all the rites
 unhone apane laabh main se ek kaam degas kaa or ek kaam monet dwaara kharida 
 unhone 1880 or 1881 kii sanskaaravaadi pradarshaniyon main pradarshit kiya or 1886 tak chhapkaaron ke sarkal main ek sakriy sadsy bani rahi

 unhone us avadhi ke dauraan parivaar ke sadasyon ke kai portrates banaaye, jisame portret of alexander kasaat and hiss san robert kelso kaa ek portret sarvshereshth mana jaataa he
 Her style then evolved and she began to move away from sacramentalism and adopt a simpler and more explicit approach
 She also began exhibiting her work in New York galleries
 After 1886, she did not identify herself with any art movement and experimented with various techniques
 unki lokapriy chhavi, maan or bachche ke vishay par, kathorta se khinchi gayi ek vyapak shrinkhalaa, namrata se banaai gayi, par bade paimaane par abhaavuk chitron or prints par aadhaarit he, 
 is vishay par ek kaam he drypoint 'gardenar held by hiss madar ', haalanki is vishay par wo pehle bhi kuch kaam kar chuki thi
 Some of these works reflect his own relatives, friends, or clients, though in later years he used professional models in his creations, often reminiscent of the performances of the Italian Renaissance Madonna and Baby
 1900 ke baad, unhone kaaphi had tak keval maan or bachche ke vishyon par hi kaam kiya
 In 1891, he performed a series of highly original color drypoints and aquatintprints, including 'woman Bathing and the Coiffure', inspired by Japanese masters and shown in Paris a year earlier
 wo saadagi or japani dizin kii spashtataa or rang ke blokon ke kushal upyog kii ore aakarshith thi
 In his work, he mainly used light, delicate pastel colors and avoided black

 yadhyapi wo america sangraahakon salaah dene main sakriy thi, par america main unki kala ko manyata dhire dhire hi mili
 In the US, he also received some recognition among his family members, because his famous brother was more recognized there

 Since Lord Dhanvantari appeared with the urn, there is a tradition of buying utensils on this occasion
 kahin kahin lokmanyata ke anusaar yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki is din dhan kharidne se usamen tairah guna vruddhi hoti he
 On this occasion, people also buy coriander seeds and keep them in the house

 There is also the practice of buying silver on the day of Dhanteras; When it is not possible, people buy silverware

 Santosh has been called the greatest wealth
 jiske paas santosh he vah swasth he sukhi he or vahi sabase dhanwaan he
 There is no wealth greater than the wealth of satisfaction for the health and health of Lord Dhanvantari, who is also the god of medicine
 log is din hi deepawali kii raat lakshmi ganesh kii puja hetu murti bhi kharidte hen
 On the evening of Dhanteras, there is also the practice of lighting the lamp at the main gate outside the house and in the courtyard

 Dhanvantari is the physician of the gods and is considered to be the god of medicine, so the day of Dhanteras is very important for physicians
 dhanteras ke sandarbh main ek lok katha prachlit he ki ek baar yamraj ne yamaduton se poocha ki praaniyon ko mrityu kii god main sulaate samay tumhaare man main kabhi dayaa kaa bhav nahin aata kya
 Before the fear of Yamdevata, the messengers said that they perform their duty and obey their command, but when Yamdevata removed the fear of the messengers' mind, they said that once while taking the life of King Hema's celibate son Hearing the lamentation of the newly wedded wife, our heart also got upset but according to the law of law, we could not do anything by wishing
 ek doot ne baton hi baton main tab yamraj se prashn kiya ki akaal mrityu se bachane kaa koi upaay he kya
 Answering this question, Yama Devta said that the person who keeps a lamp in the south direction in the name of Yama on the evening of Dhanteras, does not die prematurely
 is manyata ke anusaar dhanteras kii shaam log aangan main yama devtaa ke naam par deep jalaakar rakhte hai
 On this day people also keep a fast in the name of God Yama

 vedon kii prakruti vigyaanvaadee hone ke kaaran pashchimi jagat main inkaa danka baj rahaa he
 The Vedic period reaches its zenith only after the creation of the Mantra texts, with the establishment of various branches throughout northern India, which discuss their meaning to the mantra codes with the meanings of Brahman, and the age of Buddha and Panini The rise of Mahajanapadas reaches its end in

 vaidic kaal main granthon kaa sancharan maukhik parampara dwaara kiya gaya tha, vistrut naimanik takneekon kii sahaayta se parishuddhta se sangrakshit kiya gaya tha
 The literary tradition can be traced back to the Vedic times following the rise of Buddhism in the Mauryan period, perhaps the earliest in the Kanva text of the Yajurveda of the 1st century BCE; However the oral tradition of transmission remained active
 vizel ne 1 sahastrabdi bisii ke ant main likhit vaidic granthon kii sambhaavna kaa suzav diya
 Some scholars such as Jack Goody state that "the Vedas are not the products of an oral society", basing this approach by comparing the discrepancies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as Greek, Serbia and other cultures
 Focusing on, Vedic literature is very coherent and vast which was composed orally over generations, without being written
 haalanki, gaudi kehete hai, vaidic granthon kii ek likhit or maukhik parampara donon main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he, ise "sakshartaa samaaj ke samanaantar utpaadon" kehete hai
 Due to the ephemeral nature of manuscript material, surviving manuscripts rarely cross the age of a few hundred years

 Vedas, Vedic rituals and its auxiliary sciences called Vedang were part of the curriculum at ancient universities such as Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramashila
 pracheen kaal main mana jaataa he ki agni, vaayu, aditya or angira rishiyon ko vedon kaa gyaan mila jiske baad saat rishiyon ko ye gyaan mila - iskaa ullekh gita main hua he
 Historically Brahma, his sons Badarayana and grandson Vyasa and others such as Jaimini, Patanjali, Manu, Vatsyayan, Kapil, Kanad etc
 had good knowledge of the Vedas

 In chapter 2, Krishna tells Arjuna that he will find his words easy in lieu of the rhetorical language of the Vedas

 Mahidhar and Uvvat were commentators of this category
 aadhunik kaal main raja rammohan raay kaa brahm samaaj or dayanand saraswati kaa arya samaaj lagbhag ek hi samay main vedon ke sabase bade prachaarak bane
 In addition to this, Shankar Pandurang published Atharvaveda in four volumes besides Sayan Bhashya
 lokmaanya tilak ne orin or da arctic home in vedaz naamak do granth vaidic sahitya kii samiksha ke rup main likhe
 Balkrishna Dixit published his knowledge on Samaveda from Calcutta in 1877
 shripad damodar satavlekar ne satara main chaaron vedon kii samhita kaa shrampurvak prakaashan karaayaa
 The publication of Sayan Bhasya of the Rigveda published in five volumes from Tilak Vidyapeeth, Pune is also considered authentic

 After this, Shriram Sharma Acharya of Gayatri Tapobhoomi has also published the commentaries of the Vedas - his commentaries are scripted
 satrahavin sadi main mogul badshaah aurangzeb ke bhai daara shukoh ne kuch upanishdon kaa farsi main anuwaad kiya jo pehle francisi or baad main anya bhashaaon main anudit huin
 In Europe, it was followed by Vedic and Sanskrit literature
 maiks mular jaise europea vidwaan ne bhi sanskrit or vaidic sahitya par bahut adhyayan kiya he
 But the attention of the scholars of Europe is focused on making and proving the theory of the Hindu Aryan language family
 shabdon kii samanta ko lekar bane is siddhant main aitihaasik tathy or kaal nirdhaaran ko tod-marod karnaa hi padataa he
 For this reason, the time of creation of Vedas is considered to be 1800-1000 BC which does not meet Sanskrit literature and Hindu principles
 lekin arya jatiyon ke prayaag ke siddhant ke tahat or bhashaagat drushti se yahi kaal in granthon kii rachana kaa maan liya jaataa he
 The incarnation period of the Vedas is considered to be the beginning of the present creation
 iske hisaab se veda ko avatarit hue 2017 ko 1,97,29,49,118 varsh honge
 The Vedas remained as Shruti after the incarnation and much later the Vedas were scripted and Vedangas were invented from the Vedas to preserve or better understand the Vedas
 isamen upasthit khagoleey vivarnanusaar kai itihaaskaar ise 5000, 7000 saal purana maanate hai parantu aatmachintan se gyaat hota he ki jaise saat din biit jane par punah ravivaar aata he vaise hi ye khagoleey ghatnaayen baar baar hotin hai atah inke aadhaar par gananaa shreyaskar nahin
 Some of the real Vedas, which were the repository of knowledge, were destroyed in the Mughal Empire and some during the British
 veda hame brahmad ke anokhe, aalokik va anant raaj bataate he jo samay va samaj se pare he
 The ancient policies and knowledge of the Vedas not only explain this world, but they can also prove to be helpful in running this world again in a smooth manner
 pracheen kaal se bharat main vedon ke adhyayan or vyakhya kii parampara rahi he
 According to the Vedic Sanatan Varnashrama religion, sages and sages, from Brahma to Veda Vyasatatha Jaimini in Ahasuyuga, have considered these as words, evidence and have also built their texts based on them
 parashar, katyayan, yajyavlky, vyas, panini aadi ko pracheen kaal ke vedavetta kehete hai
 There is a tradition of interpreting the Vedas after the knowledge of the four sages
 atah falswaroop ek hi vedaka swarup bhi mantra,brahman, aaranyak, upanishad ke rupmen chaar hi mana gaya he
 Historical Puranas etc
 were composed in the form of lectures of great texts Vedas
 pracheen kaal or madhyayug main shastrarth isi vyakhya or arthantar ke kaaran hue hai
 The main topic - with words like Dev, Agni, Rudra, Vishnu, Marut, Saraswati etc
 vedavetta maharishi swami dayanand saraswati ke vichaar main gyaan, karm, upasna or vigyaan vedon ke vishay hai
 Knowledge of the individual nature of these three eternal entities is available only through Vedas

 According to Hinduism, Maharishi Manu, the oldest lawmaker, said that Vedokhilo Dharmamoolam - Veda is the basic basis of religion and theology in the form of Khmerless Vedas i
e
 Sampradaya Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 na keval dharmik kintu aitihaasik drushti se bhi vedon kaa asaadhaaran mahatva he
 The Vedas are the only way to know the culture and civilization of the Aryans of the Vedic era

 According to them, the word Devta means - giving things, learned people and Sukta mantras, not idol-worshiping adorable forms

 It was nothing but a thought-provoking conspiracy
 unka mukhya kaary bharat ko khokhla karnaa or hinduon ko isai bananaa tha
 Those Anglo translators used to say, "aryans are foreigners
 wo bharat aae or unhone yahan rahane vaale logon ko maaraa, taadit kiya tathaa yahan shashan kiya
 The Indians worshiped the penis, and were called dasyu or demons
 " parantu usee kalkhand ke itihaaskaaron ne yah sabit kar diya ki yah keval myth hi he or isamen ratti bhar bhi sachai nahin he or hadappa mohanjo dado ke purvaj bhi arya hi the
 The evidence of Mohenjo-daro being Vedic was known from the currencies obtained in mining, one of which is described below

 When asked, he said that whatever he wrote, he wrote it after studying the Vedic translation of the British
 bharat to ab swatantra ho gaya parantu angrejon kaa boyaa yah paudha aaj bhi fal or phool rahaa he
 The Indian government and people are still lying in such stupidity, a proof of this is a version of Muslim India which was printed on 27 March 1985
 bhartiya vidyalayon main yahi bataaya, padhaayaa jaataa rahaa; isise bharat kaa bhavishya gyaat ho jaataa he
 India is infected with this insane ideology even after independence, the direct evidence of this was the low point of Mr
 Frank Anthony, which he put before the Parliament on 4 September 1977
 vaidicon kaa yah sarvasvagranth 'vedatrayee' ke naam se bhi vidit he
 Earlier this Veda Granth was the same name as Yajurveda - Ekavasiidyajurveda Chaturdha: Personally again, the same Yajurveda became famous as rik-yajusva-samas, from which it was called 'trilogy'
 Later it became very difficult to read Veda, so three or four divisions of the same Veda were done
 tab unako rigyajusamke rupame vedatrayee athwa bahut samay baad rigyajusamatharv ke rup main chaturveda kahalaane lage
 Mantras were categorized on the basis of type and meaning
 iskaa aadhaar is prakaar he - The Vedic tradition is of two types - the Brahma tradition and the Aditya tradition
 dono parampara ke vedatrayee parampara pracheen kaal me prasiddh tha
 There are three styles of word usage in the world: poetry, prose and anthem
 vedon ke mantron ke 'padya, gadhy or gaan' aise teen vibhaag hote hai - There are definite rules of letter-number and foot and punctuation in the verse
 atah nishchit akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam vaale veda-mantron kii sangya 'rik' he
 Mantras, which do not have the letter number and foot and punctuation according to the rules of the verse, are called 'yajuha' and all the chants are lyrical, they are called 'sama'
 in teen prakaar kii shabd-prakaashan-shaileyon ke aadhaar par hi shaastra evam lok main veda ke liye ‘trayee’ shabd kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The Yajurveda is a prose collection, so the verses of the Rigveda in this Yajurveda are recited as prose at the time of reading the Yajurveda
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke purv vedon ke ukt chaar vibhaag alag-alag nahin the
 At that time, Rik, Yajuh and Sama - in these three word-styles, a specific study of the collective word-amount was called Veda
 peeche jaakar veda ke samakaksh me atharv bhi salagn ho gaya, phir 'trayee' ke jagah 'chaturveda' kahalaane lage | guru ke rusht hone par jinhone sabhi vedon ko aditya se praapt kiya he un yajyavlky ne apni smriti me vedatrayee ke baad or puranon ke aage atharv ko sammilit kar bolaa vedanstharvpuranani iti 
 The present-day Vedas are four - but earlier they were the same
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar maane jate hai
 But these four together were considered to be a single 'veda Granth'
 lakshantah trayee hote huye bhi veda ek hi tha, phir usko charbhagame baanta gaya
 Due to the spread of hearing and memorization from generation to generation, the creator Brahmaji also has Shruti, Amnaya due to self-proof, Amauya due to self-attestation, and Apoorusheya, etc
, due to attaining the form of Aaurusheya Vani
 veda ke pathan-pathan ke kram main gurumukh se shravan evam yaad karne kaa veda ke sangrakshan evam safalataa kii drushti se atyant mahatva he
 For this reason Veda is also called "shruti"
 veda parishrampurvak abhyaas dwaara sangrakshniya he, is kaaran iskaa naam ‘'amnaay’' bhi he
 The Maharshiyans have created the Ashta deformity in the defense of Vedas - Jata Mala Shikha Rekha Dhwajo Dando Ratho Ghanah | Ashtau Deformity: Procto permutative Maharsay: || As a result of which, like ancient times, even today, there is chanting in the form of lust, long, stilted and sublime, unspoken vocal
 iske anusaar prayek shakha kii vaidic shabd-raashi kaa vargeekaran- upar varnit prayek veda ke chaar bhaag hote hai
 Apart from the first part of the mantra, the other three parts are not considered as Vedas, but such an idea has not been proved to be logical
 anadi vaidic parampara main mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad ek hi vedake chaar avyav he
 Overall the parts of the Vedas are: - upar ke chaaron khand veda hone par bhi kuch log keval 'samhita' ko hi veda maanate hai
 At the end of Dwaparyug, Shri Krishna Dvapayan Ved Vyasa ji had four divisions of that Veda keeping in view the use of Yagyushthan and taught these four divisions to four disciples
 ye hi chaar vibhaag rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ke naam se prasiddh he
 The four disciples named Pal, Vaishampayan, Jaimini and Sumantu taught the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda respectively
 in chaar shishyon ne shakal aadi apane bhinn-bhinn shishyon ko padhaayaa
 Due to the propagation and preservation of the Vedas by these disciples under their own, they will be greatly expanded through the Vedic texts, Charan, Branch, Pratiksha and Anushaka
 The same preachers are famous by the name of sages
 purvokt chaar shishyone shurume jitne shishyonko anushravan karaayaa ve charansamuh kahalaaye | prayek charansamuhame bahutse shakha hote he
 And in this way Pratishakha, Anushakha etc
 became
 veda kii anek shakhaaen yani vyaakhyaan kaa tarika bataayi gayi hai
 According to the sage Patanjali's Mahabhashya, 21 of the Rigveda, 101 of Yajurveda, 1001 of Samaveda, 9 of Arthaveda have 1131 such branches, but today only 12 branches are available in the original texts
 veda kii prayek shakha kii vaidic shabdarashi chaar bhaagon main uplabdh he: 1
 samhita 2
 brahman 3
 aaranyak 4
 upanishad
 Some people consider the Samhita as Vedas
 shesh teen bhaag ko vedon ke vyakhya granth maanate hai
 In different branches, the original codes remain the same but there is a difference between the Aranyak and Brahmin texts
 kai mantra bhaag main bhi upanishad miltaa he jaisaa ki shuklayajurveda mantrabhagamen isavasyopanishad| puraane samay main jitani shakhaaen thi utani hi mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad hote the |itani shakhaon ke babajud bhi aajkal kul 9 shakhaon ke hi granth milte hai
 In other branches, some mantras, some Brahmins, some Aranyakas and some Upanishads are found
 itane hi nahi adhik shakhaonke to upanishad hi paaya jaataa he ,tabhi to upanishad adhik milte hai
 The Vedic sages found the Vedas to be popular in public welfare
 nihsandeh jaisaa ki -:yathema vaachan kalyanimavadani janebhyah vaisaa hi veda hi yagnarthambhipravrita kalanupoorvyabhihitashch yagyah tasmadidan kalvidhanshastran yo jyotishan veda sa veda yagyam vedon kii pravritih janakalyan ke kaary me he
 The word Veda is formed by applying the suffix h to vid dhatu
 sanskrit grathon main vid gyane or vid laabhe jaise visheshnon se vid dhaatu se gyaan or laabh ke arth kaa bodh hota he
 The subjects of Vedas depend on their interpretation - topics like Agni, Yajna, Surya, Indra, Soma, Brahma, mana-atma, Jagatna, the qualities of substances, religion, couplets, meditation-yoga, Pran recurrently
 yajna main devtaa, dravya, uddeshy,or vidhi aadi viniyukt hote hai
 According to the texts, their description is as follows - rugveda ko chaaron vedon main sabase pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is divided in two ways
 pratham prakaar main ise 10 mandalon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Circles contain some hymns in Suktas, Suktas
 kul richaayen 10520 hai
 The Rigveda has 64 chapters in another way
 aath-aath adhyyon ko milakar ek ashtak banaaya gaya he
 There are eight such octaves in total
 phir prayek adhyay ko virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The number of classes is different in different chapters
 kul varg sankhya 2024 he
 Each class has some mantras
 sristi ke anek rahasyon kaa inamen udghaatan kiya gaya he
 Earlier it had 21 branches, but at present its branch branch is being promoted
 isamen gadhy or padya donon hi hai
 Yajna is the priority of karma
 pracheen kaal main isaki 101 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main keval paanch shakhaaen hai - kathak, kapishthal, maitrayani, taittiriya, vaajasaneyi
 This Veda has two distinctions - Krishna Yajurveda and Shukla Yajurveda
 krishna yajurveda kaa sankalan maharishi veda vyas ne kiya he
 Its other name is also Taittiriya Samhita
 isamen mantra or brahman bhaag mishrit hai
 Shukla Yajurveda - It was given by Surya as a sermon to Yajnavalkya
 isamen 15 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main madhyandin ko jise vaajasaneyi bhi kehete hai praapt hai
 It has 40 chapters, 303 anuvakas and 1975 mantras
 antim chalisvaan adhyay eshavasyopanishad he
 This is the lyrical book
 isamen gaan vidya kaa bhandar he, yah bhartiya sangeet kaa mul he
 The singing of the hymns is called Sama
 isaki 1001 shakhaaen thim
 But nowadays only three are prevalent - Kothumiya, Jaiminiya and Ranayaniya
 isko purvarchik or uttararchik main baanta gaya he
 There are four scandals in the predecessor - igneous scandal, andra scandal, Powman scandal and Aranya scandal
 chaaron kandon main kul 640 mantra hai
 Then there are 10 mantras of Mahanamanyarchik
 is prakaar purvarchik main kul 650 mantra hai
 There are six readers
 uttararchik ko 21 adhyyon main baanta gaya
 There are nine readers
 isamen kul 1225 mantra hai
 Thus the Samaveda has a total of 1875 mantras
 isamen adhiktar mantra rugveda se liye gaye hai
 It can also be called the originator of worship
 isamen ganit, vigyaan, ayurveda, samaaj shaastra, krishi vigyaan, aadi anek vishay varnit hai
 Some people also find mantra-tantra in it
 yah veda jahaan brahm gyaan kaa upadesh karata he, vahiin moksh kaa upaay bhi bataata he
 It is also called Brahma Veda
 isamen mukhya rup main atharvan or angiras rishiyon ke mantra hone ke kaaran atharv angiras bhi kehete hai
 It is divided into 20 kandas
 prayek kand main kai-kai sutara hai or sutron main mantra hai
 There are a total of 5977 mantras in this Veda
 isaki aajkal do shakhaaen shounik evam pippalad hi uplabdh hai
 The scholar of the Atharvaveda is the author of the four Vedas
 yajna main rugveda kaa hota devon kaa aahnan karata he, samaveda kaa udgaata samgaan karata he, yajurveda kaa adhvaryu dev:kotikarm kaa vitan karata he tathaa atharvaveda kaa brahm puure yajna karm par niyantran rakhata he
 Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharva Veda and Sthapatya Veda - These have been told by the Upveda Katyayana of the four Vedas respectively
 vedon ke sarvangin anushilan ke liye shiksha, kalp, vyakaran, nirukt, chand or jyotish ke granth hai jinhen 6 ang kehete hai
 Pratipadasutra, Anupada, Chandobhasha, Dharmashastra, Justice and Vaiseshika - These 6 views are also available
 upangon ke vishay is prakaar hai - In the Veda samhita, there are signs of chanting their high, medium, or slow musical vowels by placing standing and horizontal lines in the mantras
 inako udaatt, anudaatt fir swaarit ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya he
 These vowels have been in vogue since ancient times and Mahamuni Patanjali has included his main cardinal rules in his great language
 swaron ko adhik yaa nune rup se bole jane ke kaaran inke bhi do-do bhed ho jate hai
 Such as udatta-udattar, anuadatta-anudattar, swarika-swarittodatta
 inke alaave ek or swar mana gaya he - shruti - isamen teenon swaron kaa milan ho jaataa he
 Thus the total number of vowels becomes 7
 in saat swaron main bhi aapas main milane se swaron main bhed ho jaataa he jiske liye swar chihnon main kuch parivartan ho jaataa he
 Although many methods are used in the marking and typing of these vowels and there is not a single mode common in publisher-commentators, in most places a horizontal line below the letter for the approved and a vertical line above the letter for the vocal
 Is the rule
 udaatt kaa apana koi chihn nahin he
 Due to this problem in marking, many writer-publishers do not use vowel signs at all
 vaidic mantron main prayukt chand kai prakaar ke hai jinamein mukhya hai- According to this, the ritual of Vedokta Yajna is considered to be the main use of the words of Veda
 sristi ke armbh se hi yajna karne main saadharantaya mantroccharan kii style, mantrakshar evam karm-vidhi main vividhta rahi he
 It is due to this diversity that the branches of the Vedas have expanded
 yatha-rugveda kii 21 shakha, yajurveda kii 101 shakha, samaveda kii 1000 shakha or atharvaveda kii 9 shakha- is prakaar kul 1,131 shakhaayen hai
 This number is also mentioned by Maharishi Patanjali in his great language
 uparyukt 1,131 shakhaon main se vartmaan main keval 12 shakhaayen hi mul granthon main uplabdh haih- Out of the above 12 branches, only 6 branches have the learning style - Shakal, Taittariya, Madhyandini, Karma, Kauthum and Shaunak Shakha
 yah kahana bhi anupyukt nahin hoga ki anya shakhaon ke kuch or bhi granth uplabdh hai, kintu unase shakha kaa puraa parichay nahin mil saktaa evam bahut-si shakhaon ke to naam bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 As mentioned above, understanding of many words of Vedas has not been as simple
 vedunkaa vaastavik arth samajhane ke liye inke bhitarase hi vedangunka avishkaar kiya gaya | isaki vajah inamen varnit arthon ko janaa nahi ja saktaa | sabase adhik vivaad-vaarta ishwar ke swaroop, yani ekmaatr yaa anek devon ke sadrishy ko lekar hua he
 The real meaning of Vedoun can be done only by those who know the education - Kalpa, Grammar, Nirukta, Chanda and Astrology
 europe ke sanskrit vidwaanon kii vyakhya bhi hind-arya jati ke siddhant se prerit rahi he
 In the ancient times itself, many such opinions appeared, challenging their power, which are still called religious views but are different in many ways
 inkaa mukhya antar neeche spasht kiya gaya he
 Among them, who are guided by the Vedas, shakhas, and Kalpasutra, who believe in a unique universe, believe in the Vedas by not engaging in any one god, they believe in the Vedic Sanatana Varnashrama religion, they consider Vedon as Sarvopari
 iske alaava alag alag vichaar rakhanevaale or pruthak pruthak devtaa maanane vaale kuch sampradaay ye hai-: The topics which have been disputed are given below
 yajna:yajna ke vartmaan rup ke mahatv ko lekar kai vidwaanon, maton or bhashkaron main virodhabhash he
 The use of fire in the yajna has been so much similar to the ancient Parsi worship method and scholars have been interested in the immense importance of havan
 devtaa:dev shabd kaa lekar hi kai vidwaanon main asahmati rahi he
 The Vedokta Nirguna - formless and saguna - in many faiths who believe in the last aspect of the form, consider it to be a great person with special powers as a great man and worship them in idol, while many others call them the names of God
 paroapkaar karne vaali vastuen, vidwaan log or maargdarshan karne vaale mantron ko dev kaha gaya he
 For example, by not understanding the meaning of the word fire, first of all, that is to say, God
 devtaa shavd kaa arth divya, yani parameshwar kii shakti se purna mana jaataa he - jaise prithvi aadi
 Mahadev, in this view, calls God because he is the Lord of the Gods
 isi tarah sarvatra vyapak ishwar vishnu or satya hone ke kaaran brahma kehalaata he
 In this way, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev are not names of any character but names of God
 vyakaran or niruktake valpar hi vaidic or loukik shabdonke arth nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of this, they sit in the waste of meaning
