 Solchenitsyn was an important 20th century writer of the Russian language
 solshenitsin ne kai upanyaas, kavitaayen or kahaniyon kii rachana kii
 It is the winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize
 ek ank vaale naatakon ko ekanki kehete hai
 In English for the term "one act play" both the words "ekanki Natak" and "ekanki" are treated equally
 pashchim main ekanki 20 veen shatabdi main, visheshat: pratham mahayuddh ke baad, atyant prachlit or lokapriy hua
 It was widely practiced in Hindi and other Indian languages in the fourth decade of this century
 iskaa yah arth nahin ki ekanki sahitya kii sarvatha abhijatyaheen vidha he
 Nearby forms are found in the theatrical literature of both East and West
 saskrunt naatyashaastra main nayak ke charit, itivrutt, ras aadi ke aadhaar par rupakon or uparupakon ke jo bhed kiye gaye unamem se anek ko dow kith ne ekanki naatak kaha he
 Thus the Vyayoga, Prahasana, Bhag, Veethi, Natika, Goshthi, Sattak, Natyarasak, Prakashika, Ullapya, Poetry Prakhandan, Shrigadit, Vilasika, Vesika, Halish, etc
 described in "darsarupaka" and "sahityadarpan", have metaphors and epithets near modern modern It would not be unfair to say relative
 "sahityadarpan main "ekank" shabd kaa prayog bhi hua he : Bhā :a: si धa raूर्तचरcharitोोa nanavasthaत्मकaत्मकaत्मकa :a :a।
 ekank ek evatr nipun : pandito vit:
 
 or Khyateetivritto Vyayoga: Self-woman

 ekankkasch bhavet


 The earliest and undeveloped but closely contested form of modern Ekanki in the Natyasakhyatya of the West is "interlude"
 15veen or 16veen shatabdiyon main prachlit sadachaar or naitik shikshapurna angreji morality naatakon ke kore upadesh se paidaa hui ub ko dur karne ke liye prahasanpurn ansh bhi jod die jate hai
 Such segments were called interludes
 kramash: ye morality naatakon se swatantra ho gaye or ant main unki parinti vyangy-vinod-pradhan teen paatro ke chote naatakon main hui
 Called "curtain Razor" or Patonnayak, one who can be compared to the philanthropist or observer of Sanskrit plays was the closest predecessor to modern units in the West
 raatri main der se khaanaa khaane ke baad rangashaalaon main aanevaale sambhraant saamaajikon ke kaaran samay se aanevaale saadhaaran saamaajikon ko badi asuvidha hoti thi
 The owners of the theater, meanwhile, began to offer bipartisan hilarious dialogues to keep ordinary socials engaged in entertainment
 is prakaar ke swatantra samvaad ko hi "kartin reiser' kaha jaataa tha
 It lacked plot and real and dramatic duality of life
 baad main "kartin reiser' ke sthaan par yatharth jivan ko lekar sugathit kathanak or naatakeey dwandwavaale chote naatak prastut kiye jane lage
 The next step in their development was modern acanci
 ekanki itnaa lokapriy ho uthaa ki bade naatakon kii raksha karne ke liye vyavsaayik rangashaalaon ne use apane yahan se nikaalnaa shuru kiya
 But seeing the possibilities of experimentation and development in it, in many countries of the West, unconventional and experimental theater movements adopted it
 landan, paris, berlin, dublin, chicago, neuyark aadi ne is nae dhang ke naatak or uske rangamanch ko aage badhaayaa
 Apart from this, Ekanki drama got the strength of many great or respected writers of the west
 aise lekhakon main rus ke chesav, gorki or acrinov, france ke jiroudo, sartra or enil, germany ke toler or brekht, italy ke pirandeli tathaa england, ireland or america ke askar wild, galsvardi, je
em
bairi, lard dansaini, sinj, shiaan o' kasee, ujin o'nil, noel carward, tii
es
iliyat, christopher frai, graham green, miller aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Because of the theatrical movements and the combined and indomitable experimental courage and enthusiasm of these writers, modern unity became completely new, independent and articulated
 unki kritiyon ke aadhaar par ekanki naatakon kii saamaanya visheshtaon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 The morphological difference of large plays and units becomes apparent on the surface itself
 ekanki naatak saadhaarant: 20 se lekar 30 minute main pradarshit kiye ja sakate hai, jabaki teen, chaar yaa paanch ankonvaale naatakon ke pradarshan main kai ghante lagate hai
 But the fundamental difference between big plays and units is creative rather than morphological
 pashchim ke teen se lekar paanch ankonvaale naatakon main do yaa do se adhik kathankon ko goonth diya jaataa tha
 Thus they had one major plot and one or several sub-plots
 sanskrit naatakon main bhi aise upakthanak hote the
 In such plays a continuous change in place or scene, period and events was natural
 lekin ekanki main yah sambhav nahin
 Ekanki is based on a dramatic event or mental state and concentration of influence is its main goal
 isliye ekanki main sthaan, samay or ghatana kaa sankalantray anivaary sa mana gaya he
 Like story and song, the art of Ekanki is the art of density or concentration and frugality, in which maximum effect is produced with the help of minimal equipment
 ekanki ke kathanak kaa pariprekshya atyant sankuchit hota he, ek hi mukhya ghatana hoti he, ek hi mukhya charitra hota he, ek charmotkarsh hota he
 Instead of long speeches and elaborate interpretations, there is dialogue
 bade naatak or ekanki kaa gunatmak bhed isi se spasht ho jaataa he ki bade naatak ke kalevar ko kaat chhantakar ekanki kii rachana nahin kii ja sakati, jis tarah ekanki ke kalevar ko khinch tanakar bade naatak kii rachana nahin kii ja sakati
 According to Sanskrit Natyasastra, five stages have been considered for the development of the plot of the big drama: beginning, effort, attainment, destiny and flourishing
 pashchim ke naatyashaastra main bhi inhen se bahut kuch milti julati sthitiyon kaa ullekh he : aarambh yaa bhoomika, charitron or ghatnaon ke ghaat pratighaat yaa dwandv se kathanak kaa charmotkarsh kii ore aaroh, charmotkarsh, avaroh or ant
 Duality is heavily emphasized in the dramatics of the West
 vastut: naatak dwandv kii kala he; katha main charitron or ghatnaon ke kramik vikaas kii jagah bade naatak main kuch charitron ke jivan ke dwandvon ko udghaatit kar kathanak ko charmotkarsh par pahunchaaya jaataa he
 The axis of this climax in Ekanki is only a duality
 bade naatak ke kathanak main dwandvon kaa vikaas kaaphi dhimaa ho saktaa he, jisamen sari ghatnaayen rangamanch par prastut hoti hai, yaa us ghatana se kuch hi purv hota he jo bade veg se dwandv ko charmotkarsh par pahunchaa detii he
 Often this climax is the end of unity
 jivan kii samasyaon ke yathartwaadee or manovaigyanik chithran ke atirikt rachanavidhan kii yah visheshta aadhunik ekanki ko sanskrit or pashchimi natya sahitya main uske nikatavarti roopon se pruthak karti he
 Often the adaptation of stories to acting creates the illusion that Ekanki is the actor's form of the story
 lekin rachanavidhan main ghanatv or mitvyayta kii aadharbhoot samanta ke baavjood kahani or ekanki main shilpagat bhed he
 Being a proverb, acting and storytelling are of paramount importance in Ekanki
 inhen ke madhyam se ekanki charitrachitran, kathanak or uske dwandv, vaataavaran or ghatnaon ke anubandh kaa nirmaan karata he
 Like story, Ekanki cannot take shelter of narration
 lekin abhinay kii ek mudra kahani ke lambey varnan se adhik prabhaavshaalee ho sakati he
 Therefore theater is both the extent and power of unicameral
 isaki pahchaan na hone ke kaaran anek safal kahanikar asafal ekankikar rah jate hai
 Similarly, it is illusionary to consider interesting discourse or narrative on a subject as one
 jivan ke yatharth, ghatana yaa kathanak, charitron ke dwandv, sankalantray ityadi ke abhaav main sambhaashan keval sambhaashan rah jaataa he, use ekanki kii sangya nahin di ja sakati
 Due to the amazing possibilities of Ekanki, it has developed in many directions in modern times
 radio roopak, sangeet tathaa kavyarupak or monolog yaa swagat natya in nai dishaao kii kuch mahatvapurn uplabdhiyaan hai
 Through radio, all these are constantly being used in the field
 rangamanch, sadeh abhinaytaon or abhinetriyon, unke abhinay or mudraon ke abhaav main radio roopak ko shabd or unki dhwani tathaa chitratmak shakti kaa adhik se adhik upyog karnaa padataa he
 The lack of tangible instruments is not merely an obstacle to the radio metaphor, as the separation of word and sound from their tangible bases can focus the attention of the playwright's audience on the characters' internal duality
 radio roopak mushkil se 50 varsh purana rup he
 In the early stages, a story was presented in the voices of many people and to create the illusion of theater, a detailed description of the characters' shapes, costumes, furnishings, interests, etc
, attempted to create a real atmosphere
 america, germany, england aadi pashchimi deshon main radio ekanki ke prayogon ne uske rup ko viksit kiya or nikharaa
 Many famous American and English poets wrote poems for radio
 unamem maiklish, steefen vincent bene, karl, sandvarg, tirom gthru, looyee mcnes, saikavil west, patric dickinson, dealan tamas aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Inspired by these experiments, Hindi and other Indian language analysts have also presented radio metaphors, geetinatyas and poetic forms
 par inamen abhi anek trutiyaan hai
 Historians of Hindi literature consider Ekanki's beginning with Bharatendu Yuga
 prasad ke "ek ghunt' se doosraa charan, bhubaneshwaraprasad ke "kaaravaan' se teesraa tathaa dow ramkumar verma ke "reshmi taai' sankalan se chauthe charan kii shuruuaat kahi gai he
 But the said division does not include those integrators who started writing around 1955 AD and are still writing today
 at: hindi ekanki kaa adhyatan itihaas sankshep main is prakaar he : Two types of acacia were written in Bharatendula
 pratham, anudit yaa chhaayankit ekanki tathaa dwitiya, moulik ekanki
 In the first category, Bharatendu translated Bagla's "bharatmata" as "bharat Janani"; Bangla's translation of "bharater Yavan" by Radhacharan Goswami is "yavan people in Bharatvarsha", Kanchanacharya's cinematic metaphor of "dhananjaya Vijay", Ayodhyasim Upadhyay's "pradyumnvijaya Vyayoga" etc

 The historical narrative and the context of social reform are the subjects of the above units
 inhen aadhunik ekanki kaa praanrabhik rup kaha ja saktaa he
 These are not developed in the form of art; The styles are somewhat different but the tradition is the same
 ukt ekanki abhinaeya kii apeksha pathay adhik hai
 The authors lean toward describing the totality of life; They do not get the subtle distortion of vrittis
 prarochana, prastaavna, sutaradhar, naandi, mangalacharan, ekaadhik drishyayojna, bharatvakya aadi ke prayog kahin hai, kahin nahin bhi hai
 The shapes are ubiquitous, the points also become visual and visual like conceptions
 sankalantray ke nirvaah kaa abhaav he, shithil sanvaadon kaa bahulya evam vikaas tathaa vinyasaheen kathayojna kaa aadhiky he
 Some of these are written as farce, but the amount of satire is more than pure humor
 ekanki ke liye apekshit pramukh gun kaary kaa inamen abhaav he
 In the second era of Ekanki, "a sip" of Jaishankar Prasad was written which also has the influence of Sanskrit and the western Ekanki craft that came through Bengali
 prasad ji ne isi bich "kalyani parinay' bhi likhaa, par vah abhi tak aprakashit he
 Also, it can also be called a part of his "chadrangupta" drama

 Almost all modern characteristics of aconite are found in "one sip"

 But "one sip" remained the same; it could not divert other writers to unicorn writing
 ekanki kaa teesraa charan bhubaneshwaprasad ke "kaaravaan' sangrah se shuru hota he jisamen chah ekanki hai
 In 1938, the one-off issue of "hans" was published
 isamen tatkaaleen pratinidhi ekanki prastut kiye gaye
 Meanwhile, Satyendra's "kunal", Prithivnath Sharma's "dilemma", Ramkumar Varma's "prithviraj's Eyes"; Surya Sharan Pareek's "bailavana or Pratibhapurti" were published
 udaishankar bhatta, seth govinddas prabhruti ekankikar bhi isi kaal main ekanki lekhan kii ore pravrutt hue or unke kai shashakt ekanki prakaash main aae
 In this era, Ekanki was written about both famous and productive stories
 inamen vivaahadi saamaajik tathaa samyavadadi raajnneetik samasyaayen pramukh rup se ubhari hai
 The ancient ideology has been strongly advocated, but with it the urge to adopt new one is also clear
 pashchimi vichaar ore style ke prabhaav ko lekar ekanki ne apane rup rang main paryaapt parivartan kiya or isaki takanic main yatkinchit sthirataa ai
 If seen, this period was the cleansing period of Ekanki mode
 lekhakon ne is samay kaa sadupyog kar apane haath saadhe
 Since 1935 AD, units were also being given place under radio broadcasts, hence Radio Ekanki or Soundnatak were also written in large numbers
 chaturth charan tak pahonchte-pahonchte ekanki kaa swaroop, shilp aadi puri tarah sthir ho jate hai, unka pramanik rup saamne aata he
 Earlier, he was trying to find his right form

 Smriti is a group of scriptures of Hinduism, whose beliefs are lower than Shruti and originated by humans
 inamen veda nahin aate
 Smriti literally means "remembered"
 yadhyapi smriti ko vedon se neeche kaa darza hasil he lekin ve adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhi jaati hai, kyonki vedon ko samajhnaa bahut kathin he or smritiyon main aasaan kahaniyaan or naitik upadesh hai
 Various religious texts in its range - Gita, Mahabharata, Vishnushahasranama also began to be counted
 shankaracharya ne in sabhi granthon ko smriti hi mana he
 Manu considered the importance of Shruti and Smriti as equal
 gautam rishi ne bhi yahi kaha he ki ‘vedo dharmamul taddhidaan c smritishile'
 Hardutt narrating Gautam said that Smriti means Manusmriti
 parantu unki yah vyakhya uchit nahin prathit hoti kyonki smriti or sheel in shabdon kaa prayog strot ke rup main kiya he, kisi vishisht smriti granth yaa sheel ke liye nahin
 Smriti refers to the stereotypes and traditions lying in the memory of Vedicists, which are not mentioned in Vedic literature and modesty means emerging evidences in the behavior and conduct of those scholars
 phir bhi aapstamb ne apane dharm-sutara ke prarambh main hi kaha he ‘dharmajasamayah pramaann vedasch’
 The creation of memories took place around 500 BCE after the creation of the Vedas
 chhathi shatabdi i
pus
 ke pehle saamaajik dharm veda evam vaidic-kaaleen vyavhaar tathaa paramparaon par aadhaarit tha
 At the beginning of the Apastamb Dharma-sutra itself it has been said that its rules are based on the basis of time-based religion
 samayaacharik dharm se abhipraay he saamaajik parampara se
 The importance of all social traditions was because the creation of the scriptures was around 1000 BC
 Occurred after
 peeche shishton kii smriti main pade hue paramparaagat vyavhaaron kaa sankalan smriti granthon main rishiyon dwaara kiya gaya
 Its belief must have been accepted in the society that the things which were not written till now were alive only in the tradition, now appeared in written form
 atev shishton kii smritiyon se sankalit in paramparaon ke pustakeekrut swaroop kaa naam smriti rakhaa gaya
 Later, the field of memory became wider
 smriti kii bhashaa saral thi, niyam samyaanusaar the tathaa naveen paristhitiyon kaa inamen dhyaan rakhaa gaya tha
 Hence, they remained more people friendly and society friendly
 phir bhi shruti kii mahatta inaki apeksha atyadhik sweekaar kii gai
 But to establish a treaty between them, Jupiter said that Shruti and Smriti are two eyes of man
 yadi ek ko hi mahatta di jaay to aadmi kaana ho jayega
 Atri even went so far as to say that if one is fully versed in the Vedas and sees the memory with disgust, then twenty-one times the animal will be born in the vagina
 brihaspati or atri ke kathan se is prakaar yah spasht he ki veda ke samaan smriti kii bhi mahatta ab sweekaar kii gai
 Later, in social practice, the importance of memory over Shruti was accepted as if there is opposition in the Vedas to the tradition of adopted son, it has been accepted in the memory
 isi prakaar panchamahayajna shrutiyon ke rachana kaal kii apeksha smritiyon ke rachana kaal main vyapak ho gaya
 According to the Vedas, in Jhanjhwat, on the arrival of guests, on the full moon day, students should perform self-study as recitation was prohibited in these days
 parantu smritiyon ne in dinon swadhyay ko bhi band kar diya
 It is clear decision of Shruti regarding Shudras that they cannot attain Moksha but the Upanishads removed this bondage over Shudras and the recognition of their salvation was accepted
 ye sabhi tathy siddh karte hai ki shruti kii nirdhaarit paramparaon par smritiyon kii virdohi paramparaon ko peeche saamaajik manyata praapt ho gai
 While stating the reason for this importance of memories, Marichi has said that the words of the memories which are not meaningless or anti-shruti are the form of Shruti itself
 veda vachan rahasmay tathaa bikhare hai jinhen suvidha main smritiyon main spasht kiya gaya he
 Memory sentences are based on traditions, so Vedic proof is not required for them
 inaki vedagat pramanikta swatah sweekaarya he
 The Vedic language was beginning to seem more arrogant to the masses, while the memories were written in secular Sanskrit which the society could understand easily and they formulated principles in line with the social order
 smriti lekhakon ko bhi vaidic maharishiyon kii tarah samaaj ne garima pradaan kii thi
 Due to the changing of attitudes and circumstances between the Vedic and Smriti periods, and the confluence of various economic reasons and new ideas, Smriti got priority over Shruti
 iskaa kaaran yah bhi bataaya ja saktaa he ki samajashastreey manyata ke paksh main tha
 For all these reasons, the recognition of Shruti began to be considered insignificant from 500 BCE against the recognition of memories

 'victory Letter' was written by Guru Govind Singh to the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb
 zafarnama, dasam granth kaa ek bhaag he or isaki bhashaa farsi he
 Two papers became world famous in India's glorious history
 pehla patr chhatrapati shivaji dwaara raja jaisingh ko likhaa gaya tathaa doosraa patr guru govind singh dwaara shaasha aurangzeb ko likhaa gaya, jise zafarnama arthath 'vijay patr' kehete hai
 Undoubtedly, this letter of Guru Govind Singh is a wonderful trinity of spirituality, diplomacy and valor
 guru govind singh jahaan vishwa kii balidani parampara main adwitiya the vahiin ve swayan ek mahaan lekhak, moulik chintak tathaa kai bhashaaon ke gyaata bhi the
 He himself composed many texts

 There were 52 poets and writers present in his court, that is why he was also called 'sant Sipahi'
 ve bhakthi tathaa shakti ke adwitiya pratik the
 After the sacrifice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur and his four sons, after the Battle of Khidrana in 1706 AD, Guru Govind Singh sent a letter to Bhai Daya Singh to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb
 un dinon aurangzeb dakshin bharat ke ahmednagar main apane jivan kii antim saansen gin rahaa tha
 Bhai Daya Singh reached Ahmadnagar after traveling a long route via Delhi, Agra
 guru govind singh ke is patr se aurangzeb ko uttar bharat, visheshkar punjab kii vaastavik sthiti kaa pataa chalaa
 He understood that he was confused by the misinformation of the Mughal Subedar of Punjab, as well as he felt the valor and prestige of Guru Govind Singh
 aurangzeb ne jabardaar or mohammad yaar manasabadaar ko ek shahi farmaan dekar dilli bheja, jisamen guru govind singh ko kisi bhi prakaar kaa ksht na dene tathaa sammanpurvak laane kaa aadesh tha
 But it was not known to Guru Gobind Singh for a long time whether Bhai Daya Singh succeeded in giving Zafarnama to Aurangzeb in Ahmednagar
 at: ve swayan hi ahmednagar kii ore chal pade
 In October, 1706, he left for South India
 unhone marwar ke maarg se dakshin jane kaa vichaar kiya
 Many kings of Rajasthan welcomed him on the way
 bapor naamak sthaan par unki bhai dayaa singh se bhent hui, jo waapas punjab laut rahe the
 Guru Gobind Singh came to know about all the news
 yatra ke bich main hi 20 farvari 1707 ko unhen ahmednagar main aurangzeb kii maut kaa samachar mila, at: unki aurangzeb se bhent na ho saki
 It is difficult to say what would have happened if a 42-year-old spiritual and heroic great man met 90-year-old mathanda and barbaric Aurangzeb
 ek vidwaan ne likhaa he ki 'vishwaas, avishvaas se milane chalaa tha, kintu uske pahunchane se purv hi avishvaas dam tod chukaa tha
 In June, 1707, at a place called Jaju, Shahzada Muazzam was made emperor by the name of 'bahadurshah', who paid state honors to Guru Govind Singh
 zafarnama kaa shabdic arth he 'jeet kii chitthee'
 Guru Gobind Singh originally wrote it in Persian
 isamen maamuli parivartan bhi hue hai
 It has been translated into many languages
 hindi main iskaa anuwaad baalkrishna munjatar tathaa janajivan jot singh anand ne kiya
 Mahendra Singh has translated it into Gurmukhi and Surendra Jeet Singh into English
 kuch samay purv navtej singh saran ne bhi iskaa angreji main anuwaad kiya
 This paper has a total of 111 poetic terms in Persian
 jafarnama main guru govind singh ne veerta tathaa shaury se purna apni ladaaiyon tathaa kriyakalapon kaa romaanchakaari varnan kiya he
 The description of each battle in this poetic paper is sufficient to communicate the new life in anyone
 isamen khalsa panth kii sthapana, anandpur sahib chhodana, fatehgarh kii ghatana, chalis sikhon kii shahidi, do guru putron kaa diwaar main chunvaaya janaa tathaa chamkaur ke sangharsh kaa varnan he
 It also includes the account of Aurangzeb's severe defeat by Marathas and Rajputs
 saath hi guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko yah chetavanee bhi di he ki unhone punjab main uski paraajay kii puri vyavastha kar lee he
 In order to clarify the intention described in Guru Govind Singh's Zafarnama, it would be appropriate to give some of his key positions here
 guru govind singh ne jafarnama kaa prarambh ishwar ke samaran se kiya he
 He has written about himself that 'I have swore to God, which is the inscription of swords, arrows, spears and daggers, and the horses of a galloping horse in the battlefield
 ' unhone aurangzeb ko sambodhit karte hue likhaa, 'uskaa naam lekar, jisane tumhen badshahath di or mujhe dharm kii raksha kii daulat di he, mujhe vah shakti di he ki main dharm kii raksha karun or sachai kaa jhanda ooncha ho
 In this letter, Guru Govind Singh described Aurangzeb as 'sly', 'farebi' and 'makkar'
 saath hi uski ibaadat ko 'dhong' kaha tathaa use apane pita tathaa bhaaiyon kaa hatyara bhi bataaya
 Guru Gobind Singh, while introducing his self-respect and heroism, wrote, "I will put such a fire under your feet that in Punjab it will not even get water to extinguish you and drink you
" v guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko chunauti dete hue likhaa, 'main is yuddh ke maidan main akelaa aauungaa
 You bring two horsemen with you
 ' phir likhaa, vkya hua agar mere chaar bachche maare gayi, par kundali maare dansane vaala naag abhi baaki he
 ' guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko itihaas se sikh lene kii salaah dete hue likhaa, 'sikandar or shershah kahaan hai? aaj taimur kahaan he, babar kahaan he, humayun kahaan he, akbar kahaan he?' unhone pun: aurangzeb ko lalkaarte hue likhaa, 'agar kamajoro par julm karata he, unhen sataata he, to kasam he ki ek din aare se chirva duungaa
 With this, Guru Gobind Singh, while clarifying his policy on war and peace, wrote, 'when all efforts have been made, the path of justice is blocked, then it is right to lift the sword and it is right to fight
 ' or ant ke pad main ishwar ke prati purna aasthaa vyakt karte hue unhone likhaa, 'shatru bhale hamase hajaar tarah se shatruta kare, par jinka vishwaas ishwar par he, unka koi bal bhi baankaa nahin kar saktaa
 ' vastut: guru govind singh kaa zafarnama keval ek patr nahin balki ek vir kaa kavy he, jo bhartiya janamanas kii bhaawanaaon kaa dyotak he
 Not many patriots have taken inspiration from this letter from past to present
 guru govind singh ke vyaktitv tathaa krititv kii jhalak unke zafarnama se prakat hoti he
 His letter is a call to war, not a treaty
 saath hi shanti, dharmaraksha, aasthaa tathaa aatmavishvaas kaa parichaayak he
 This letter of his is about communicating new life and pride in the suffering, desperate, frustrated and ill-treated society

 During the making of his previously directed film Kites, director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later followed by Barfi! Developed into a script
 basu kii likhi patakatha or film kaa vaachan do samyaavadhiyon ke bich aage-peeche jate hai
 Basu says that the film-script demands a 30-year time frame for the characters, so the film's background was set in 1970
 june 2010 main, anuraag basu ne pushti kii ki film main teen log, ek baharaa or goonga aadmi, ek maansik rup se viklang ladki or ek vaachak pramukh bhoomika main honge
 Although Basu had specified that the film would be hilarious, media reports about the film's former titles such as Silence or Silence say the story is grim and dark
 basu ke anusaar unhone baster kiton or charlie chaplin kii mook filmon ke daur se prerit shaareerik kamedi kaa prayog in kalakaaron ko shradhanjali ke rup main kiya tha
 Director Anurag Basu took the decision to cast Ranbir Kapoor in the film before he started writing the screenplay and Katrina Kaif was the first choice as his reader
 march 2010 main, da times of india ne prativedit kiya tha ki ranbir kapur or katrina caff ko film main mukhya bhoomika ke liye tathaa sheershak khamoshi chun liya gaya he uske baad sheershak ko badalakar silence kar diya gaya, basu ne isaki pushti bhi kii thi
 Basu wanted to film a new girl from Kolkata to play the role of a self-styled girl
 basu kii patni ne is abhinay ke liye chopra kaa naam sujhaayaa tha
 But Basu feared that the audience would see "priyanka Chopra" as the famous actress and not the character
 basu kaa kahana tha ki, "mujhe dar tha ki main jhilmil ke paatr ke rup main priyanka chopra dekh rahaa houngaa or jhilmil paatr thik tarah se darshana sambhav nahin ho paaegaa
 This has happened to a lot of films where known faces have damaged the character
 " priyanka chopra ne kuch bhaag nibhaayaa lekin isaki ghoshnaa nahin kii gayi kyonki basu pehle is par kaary karke dekhnaa chaahate the ki yah kaisaa rahata he
 After a three-day workshop, Chopra became convinced that Chopra could act as a self-styled girl and reflected that she was happy that she chose Priyanka for the role
 baad main, basu ne pratyaksh rup main kaha ki unhone svaparayan kaa abhinay karne ke liye chopra ke alaava kisi anya se aagrah nahin kiya
 After Chopra was selected in the film, Kaif dropped the plan for unknown reasons
 media ne prativedit kiya ki chopra ko majboot abhinay vaala bhaag milane ke kaaran unhone apane aap ko film se baahar kar liya hoga
 Later, the media reported that Asin had proposed to act as a reader in place of Kaif
 yadhyapi asin ne film main kabhi kisi prastaav ko nahin chunaa
 According to media reports, no other actress wants to act in the film because according to her, the autistic part is very strong
 july 2010 main, mumbai mirar ne likhaa ki chopra vaachak kaa abhinay karne ko raji hai or svaparayan ke abhinay ko chhod rahi hai, atah anya abhinetri ko film ke liye nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he; chopra nahin chaahati ki film rukii rahe
 Basu confirmed the development of the film and said, "it is true that we have been unable to determine the other part
 " paatr nirdhaaran sambandhi anek samasyaon kaa saamana karne ke pashchaat duusare mahila paatr ke abhinay ke liye basu ne ekadam nayaa cheharaa chunaa
 In the first half of December 2010, Ileana d'cruz was selected for the second lead female performance of Vachhak and Kapoor's first love
 ranbir kapur ne film main ek bahere or gunge aadmi kaa abhinay kiya
 According to Ranbir, he drew inspiration from screen legends such as Academy Award-winning actor, Roberto Benigni, Charlie Chaplin and his grandfather Raj Kapoor
 nayak kii shaareerik viklaangata ke kaaran, basu kisi bhi sanket bhashaa kaa upyog nahin karnaa chaahate the, lekin film main kuch vyaavhaarik pratimaanon kaa upyog hua he
 Kapoor described his character as saying that he is a good-natured and good-hearted man
 film main ranbir ke abhinay ke bare main unke pita rishi kapur sabase alag vichaar rakhte hai
 According to him - "he does not like Ranbir's films as an actor, because i do not see in him that which is seen in a great actor
 " Priyanka Chopra has acted as Jhilmil
 basu ke anusaar chopra kaa abhinay film kaa sabase mushkil bhaag tha
 To prepare for her role, Chopra went to various mental institutions and spent time with self-styled people
 unka kahana he ki unhone abhinay ke liye is par shodh kiya tha kyonki bharat main svaparayanata kii sthiti ke bare main jaagrukta bahut kam he
 Chopra said that as a Hindi film heroine, she probably faced every possibility of obstruction
 unhone ullikhit kiya ki unhen jhilmil banane ke liye do pal kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki vah uske soch va vyavhaar main bhinnata hone ke kaaran uske charitra ko samaj nahin paayi
 d'cruz, who narrates the story as the narrator and plays the film's lead male character's first love, says, "shruti is such a sensitive role for acting as if she was in another stage in the film She goes away
 " basu ke anusaar, kapur, chopra or di'cruge ke paatro ke pashchaat saurabh shukla abhinit paatr inspector datta sabase mahatvapurn he
 Basu described the character as "amazing" when the other characters cry when he laughs

 nirmaataa ne film kii pradarshan tithi july 13 ko 31 agast 2012 tak sthagit kar diya kyonki sitambar 2011 main shooting nahin ho paayi thi or filmakan ke intjaar main thi
 Basu started working on Ileana's dubbing excerpt in late April 2012 as d'cruz was not comfortable with the Hindi language and wanted to learn while filming

 chaakmay kalp ke sanstar sansar main kai sthanon par milte hai jinamein europe, uttari africa, austrailia, bharatvarsh, uttari china or america mukhya hai
 Among these beds are alabaster, limestone, sandstone and conge lomaret
 chaakmay kalp ke jeevashmon main shringashnagan, shalayashn prajati, padchhidragati or pravaalon kaa vishesh mahatv he, yadhyapi bahupad, phalcoklom, shalyakanduk varg or spanj bhi bahutayat se milte hai
 In this era, there was a lot of merit of the creatures of the class creeping into the meru dandi

 Mammal organisms were still developing slowly and they were small and small

 france or switzraland main is prakaar kaa vargeekaran sambhav na hone se vahaan chaakmay shail samooh paanch bhaagon main bante hai
 There are three types of rocks of this era found in India
 vibhinn sthanon ke chaakmay sanstaron kaa sankshipt vivaran or sah-tulyank vinyas diya gaya hai

 chauthaa varg akshareey jaljon kaa he, jo madhya pradesh or jabalpur main lameta shailasamooh ke naam se vikhyath hai
 The fifth category consists of igneous rocks which are under South Sopanasham and extend from Bombay, Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat to Bihar
 bharat ke bhudroni nikshep do bhaagon main bante hai: neeche paae janevaale balua pathar, jo jiumal shailasamul kehalaate hai or unke upar milanevaale shail, jinhen chikkam samooh kehete hai
 The tigers and the deposits in Trichinapalli are of great importance in the deposits of the Chakmay Kalpa of India, as they not only reveal the physical incidences in Apharra of this era, but also know the living beings of that time
 trichanapalli kii chaakmay kalp kii shilaon main atyadhik sankhya main vibhinn prakaar ke jeevashm paae jate hai, yahan tak ki isi aadhaar par is pradesh ko bhugarbhavetaon ne purajivikeey sangrahalay kaha he
 From the economic point of view, the importance of Chakmay Institute in India is from the limestone, gypsum, ceramic, etc

 Goddess Durga is represented as a fearless woman riding on a lion
 durga devi aath bhujaaon se yukt hai jin sabhi main koi na koi shastrastra hote he
 He killed an Asura named Mahishasura

 All the resolutions made there are fulfilled
 hinduon ke shakt sampradaay main bhagwati durga ko hi duniya kii parashakti or sarvocch devtaa mana jaataa he 
 The Vedas mention Durga extensively, but the Upanishad describes the goddess "uma Haimavati"
 puraana main durga ko adishkti mana gaya he
 Durga is actually a form of Shiva's wife Adishakti, Shiva's parashakti is said to be the dominant nature, quality Maya, the mother of intelligence and disorderless

 That Adi Shakti Devi was born as Savitri, Lakshmi, and Parvati and married Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh

 Golden statue of Durga ji kalisia athwa carch kaa arth isai dharm ke antargat aane vaale kisi bhi dharmik sanghathan yaa sampradaay ko kaha jaataa he
 Church, literally means a group or gathering of people
 kalisia kuch vishesh isai vishvaasiyon kaa sanghathan yaa samooh, ko kehete hai, jinhen isai manyata ke anusaar, ekmaatr parameshwar main viswas ho tathaa unke putr isa messiah par vishwaas ho
 Members of this community of believers are thus part of a universal congregation beyond the time period
 yah saarvbhaumik kalisia ek vaishvik samudaay ke samaan he jisamen har vishwasi ek ang kaa kaary karata he
 It is a distorted form of the word 'ecclesia' in the Greek Bible; In the Bible it means - a local or community of Christians around the world

 In English, both the church and church are called "churches"
 kalisia or girjaghar main antar samajhane ke liye aap kisi desh ke saansad or sansad bhawan kaa udhaaharan le sakate hai: "sansad", kuch nirvaachit saansadon ke samooh ko kaha jaataa he, jabaki sansad bhawan, ek imaarat he, jisamen sansad kii baithken yojit hoti hai
 In the same way, the church is called a group of people, while the church is a building in which religious activities take place
 angreji main, kalisia or girjaghar, donon ko carch hi kaha jaataa he, haalaanki, adhikansh baar jab "carch" shabd kaa ullekh hota he, to sanket, bhawan par nahin, balki kalisia par hota he
 For example, "catholic Church" refers to a Catholic church, not a Catholic church
 is baat se sahamat hai ki isa ne keval ek hi kalisia kii sthapana kii thi, kintu anek kaarnon se isaayiyon kii ekta akshunn nahin rah saki
 As a result, many churches or organizations of Christianity exist today which are completely independent of each other
 unka vargeekaran is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he : Its organization is the strongest and most of the Christians around the world are its members
