 Psychology experts have also given Haas a proper place as the original trend and have given adequate consideration in its analysis
 is manan chintan ko paurvatya kavyachaaryon kii apeksha paashchaatya kavyachaaryon ne vistaarpurvak abhivyakti di he, parantu phir bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki unhone is tatv kaa puri vyapaktaa ke saath adhyayan kar liya he or yaa hasyaras yaa haas kii kavyagat abhivyanjana kii hi koi aisi paribhaasha de di he jo sabhi sabhi prakaar ke udaahranon ko apane main samet sake
 Indian Acharyas have promulgated this in a form of formulas, but in their brief statements, almost all the findings and elements of Western critics can be easily seen
 hasyaras ke liye bharat muni kaa naatyashaastra kahata he- It is written in Bhavaprakash- sahityadarpanakaar kaa kathan he- The phrase of the decider is- taatpary yah he ki haas ek pritiparak bhav he or chittavikas kaa ek rup he
 He is perplexed by distorted shape, distorted speech, distorted ethics, distorted designation, distorted decking, distorted semantics, distorted speech, distorted gestures, etc
 - the humor with these distortions, whether of the actor, of the speaker, or of anyone else
 
 vikruti kaa taatpary he pratyaashit se vipareet athwa vilakshan koi aisa vaichitrya, koi aisa betukapan, jo hamen pritikar jaan pade, kleshkar na jaan pade
 These traits include almost all the symptoms of western critics, as far as they are concerned with humor subjects
 aisa haas jab viksit hokar hamen kavikaushal dwaara saadharaneekrut rup main, athwa acharya pan
 ramchandra shukla kii shabdaawalee ke anusaar, mukt dasha main praapt hota he, vah hasyaras kehalaata he
 The expression of the sense of Haas remains relative to the country
 ghar par koi khuli deh baitha ho to darshak ko hansee na aavegi parantu utsav main bhi vah isi tarah pahunch jaae to uskaa aacharan pratyaashit se vipareet yaa vikrut mana jane ke kaaran hansee jagaa degaa; uskaa vyavhaar haas kii janani ho jayega
 If a young person is adorned, it is a matter of boredom, but a shabby old man will have a reason for adornment; We will surely start laughing at the wrestler who has fallen from the chair, but only our compassionate sympathy will grow on the child falling from the roof
 yah pehle hi kaha gaya he ki haas kaa aadhaar priti par hota he na ki dwesh par, atev yadi kisi kii prakruti, pravriti, swabhaav, aachaar aadi kii vikruti par kataaksh bhi karnaa ho to vah katukti ke rup main nahin kintu priyokti ke rup main hogi, uski tah main jalan athwa nicha dikhaane kii bhaavana na hokar vishuddh sanshuddhi kii bhaavana hogi
 This eloquence with a sense of purification will not be in the vocabulary of preaching but in the terminology of Ranjata
 hasya ke bhedon par bhi aacharyon ne vichaar kiya he
 He made two distinctions of humor
 ek he aatmasth or doosraa he parastha
 From the point of view of comedians, selfish humor is automatically the laughing of that character and superstitious humor is to make others laugh
 saamaajikon yaa sahruday shrotaaon, athwa natyadarshakon kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he anyon kii hansee ke bina swat: unamem udbhut hasya or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansataa hua dekhakar unamem utpann hasya
 By understanding this difference of perspectives, the idea of the meanings of these two words can be easily eliminated
 phir, aacharyon ne hasya ke chah bhed kiye hai - smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, avahasit or atihasit; jinhen bhavbhed nahin kintu hasankriya ke hi bhed maananaa padegaa
 In short, smiling eyes are smitten
 battisi dikh padana hasith he, ho hi kii si dhwani nikal padana vihasit he
 Rise of limb is absent
 pet pakadaneyvaali hansee avahasit he or puure thahaakevali jhakzorkarini paslithod hansee atihasit he
 The philosopher has called Smit and Hasit worthy of the best
 vihasit or upahasit ko madhyam vargeey logon ke yogya or apasit tathaa atihasit ko neech logon ke yogya kaha he
 There should be a dignity in the theater for the audience to laugh, even from that point of view, it may be considered good, moderate, inadequate
 nahin to jhakzor denevaali hansee keval nichon kii vastu samaj lene se ucch vargeey lok swasthya ke ek mahatvapurn tatv se vanchit rah jaaenge
 Dr
 Ramkumar Varma has considered three distinctions of humor with a desire for the effect of Uttam, Madhyam, Adham and has written twelve distinctions of Hasan Kriya by multiplying them with Athastha, Prastha
 smit, hasith aadi hasankriyaabhedon ko hasya kaa anubhav hi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is a different thing to just describe these experiences and it is a different thing to create these experiences in the social through your creation
 hasyaras kii safal rachana vah he jo hasyaras ke anubhav anayas utpann kara de
 There are five major differences of humor from the opinion of foreign scholars, namely Humer, Witt, Satire, Irony and Fars
 humar or fars hasya ke vishay se sambandhit hai jabaki bit, satair or irni kaa sambandh ukti ke kaushal se he jinamein pichley do kaa uddeshy keval santushti hi na hokar sanshuddhi bhi rahaa karata he
 Parody is also a genre of humor that has a relationship with the above skills but whose main purpose is satisfaction
 irni kaa arth parihaas chintya he
 In ridicule, we think, Irony should also be considered to have an inferiority or else it will become an object out of humor
 vit athwa vagvaidadhya ko ek vishisht alankaar kaha ja saktaa he
 The tithes of Indian literary scholars have done justice to Shringar, even with humor, though Bharata Muni has assumed its origin from Shringar i
e
 it is considered to be the magnitude of Rati or Preity and it was only after Shringar that the status of importance in Navaras Have given
 anand ke saath iskaa sidhaa sambandh he or na keval ranjanta kii drushti se kintu upyogita kii drushti se bhi isaki apni vishistataa he
 This body removes the tension of the mind, eradicates the grit of nature, paves the way for social improvement with introspection and self-refinement, eliminating the tiredness of the individual and society, fostering freshness in them and becoming a benefactor of public health
 yah nishchit he ki sanskrit sahitya tathaa hindi sahitya main is hasyaras ke mahatv ke anupaat se iske uttam udaahranon kii kami hi he
 Yet from the historical overview it is also clear that the flow of humor in literature has been going on continuously since the Vedic period till today, although before the present period, it is not as diverse as it is seen today
 hasyaras kii dhara ke vaividhya ko vishay or vyanjana kii drushti se dekha ja saktaa he
 We can divide the subject into shape, nature, situation, dress, speech, behavior and object
 akruti kaa betukapan he motopa, kurupata, bhaddaapan, angabhang, beja najaakat, tond, kubad, naariyon kaa atyant kaalaapan, aadi
 Humorous compositions have been done on many of these subjects
 dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki ek samay kaa haasyaaspad vishay sabhi samayon kaa haasyaaspad vishay ho jaae, aisa nahin hua karata
 Today, disgrace, cleanliness, etc
 are not considered as the subjects of humor, hence, making compositions on them will not be considered as a symbol of humor
 prakruti yaa swabhaav kaa betukapan he ujaddpan, bevakoofi, paakhand, jhenp, khushaamad, amaryadit fashanparasti, kanjusee, dikhaava panditmanyata, atihasypatrata, anadhikarpurn ahanmanyta, aadi
 Composing the absurdity of nature as your goal is more expansive than the absurdity of nature
 rachanakaaron ne kanjusee aadi kii vrittiyon par achche vyang kiye hai, parantu abhi is disha main anek vishay achoote hi chhot gaye hai
 The absurdity of the situation is the added Gangmadari, the lapse of time, the helplessness of a person etc
 in the incompatibility of society
 iskaa atyant sundar udhaaharan he ramcharitamanas kaa kevat prasang jisamen ram kaa marm samaj jane kii ding haakanevaale murkh kintu panditmanya kevat ko ram koi uttar nahin de pate or ek prakaar se chupchaap aatmasamarpan kar dete hai
 It was a satire of circumstance
 vesh kaa betukapan, haspaatr naton or vidushakon kaa priy vishay hi rahaa he or prahasanon, ramlilaon, raasalilaon, "gammat", tamaashon aadi main aasaani se diya ja saktaa he
 Dharmadhvajis disguise, disguised fashionistas, "masculine woman" disguise are absurd ones that can be the subject of creation
 vesh ke betukepan kii rachana bhi akruti ke betukepan kii rachana ke samaan praaia: chhichley darje kii hogi
 The absurdity of speech is to stutter, to put a pillowcase like "which is so" on the matter, to utter ejaculations, inhuman sounds, boiling of boonies, gossiping, panditau, ganwaru language, slang of many language words, etc
 vyavhaar kaa betukapan he asamanjas ghatnaayen, foohad harakatein, atiranjana, charitrik vikruti, saamaajik uchhrankhaltaayen, kuch kaa kuch samaj baithna, kah baithna yaa kar baithna, kathputlipan ityadi
 The absurdity of behavior can provide abundant material for the expression of humor, whether it is in the sense of humor or ridicule
 vastu kii drushti se manushya hi kyon, dev daanav pashu pakshi, khatmal machhar, jhaadoo, tokani, plate rashning aadi anek vishyon par safaltarpuk kalmen chalaai gai hai
 But as far as the fun of these items and especially with the favored gods and administrative satire, will be said to be an officer of the category of humor
 khizabhari anya rachanaayen raudra, vibhats yaa anya rason kii koti main pahunch ja sakati hai
 The expression of anticipation in expression can be seen and shown in many ways
 ise betukapan, vikruti, asamanjasata aadi shabdon se thik thik nahin samajhaayaa ja saktaa
 It is the speech that requires enough talent even in the creator and in the creator, listener or reader of that creation
 jis saamaajik main hasya kii ichha or aashaa na hogi, swabhaav main vinodpriyata or hasyonmukhataa na hogi tathaa buddhi ke shabdasanketon or vaakyagat angon ko samajhane kii kshamta na hogi, samajhnaa chahie ki uske liye hasyaras kii rachanaayen he hi nahin
 Similarly, an artist who does not have sophistication, counterproductive and the art of word weighing cannot be a successful writer of humor
 safal lekhak apratyaashit shabdadambar ke sahare, shabd kii apratyaashit vyutpatti ke sahare ; apratyaashit vilakshan upamaaon aadi alankaaron ke sahare ; vilakshan tarkoktiyon ke sahare ; vagvaidagdhya kii anek vidhaon ke sahare yatha, arth ke pher badal ke sahare pratyutar main nahale kii jagah dahala lagane kii kala ke sahare ; satair ke sahare "", krishnayan main uddhav kii ukti kii bhawan jaraihai madhupuri, shyaam bajaihain benu? bhavaniprasad mishra ji kaa geetfarosh aadi), kataaksh ke sahare ke sahare ; virup vachananukaran ke sahare ; tathaa isi prakaar kii anekanek abhivyanjana shaileyon se hasyaras kaa udrek karaayaa karte hai
 From our point of view, in our understanding humor is either especially of humor or of ridicule
 in donon shabdon ko hamane paramparaagat arth main seemaabaddh nahin kiya he
 We consider the satisfaction of poetry as a category of gimmick and the one who is pure in a sense of ridicule
 anek rachanaaon main donon kaa mishran bhi hua karata he
 It is necessary to take care of the list of socials for both humor and ridicule
 maansal shringarparak haas, aajkal ke shisht samaaj ko ruchikar nahin ho saktaa
 The satirical deity is used to make the cuckoos laugh
 uphaas ke liye suruchi kaa dhyaan atyant aavashyak he
 The fun in this is that the comedian should understand his errors but also be taken care of by the signer and do not see it as a preacher
 bina vyang ke haas ko parihaas samajhie, chaahe vah varnanaatmak ho chaahe vaartalap kii koti kaa or apane par athwa anya par, visheshat: anya par, vyang karke jo prabhaav dikhaaya jaataa he vah uphaas he hi
 The harm generated by the use of bits, humors, parodies, etc
, which is of the order of pure satisfaction, will be called a joke
 anubhav kii drushti se hasyaras ko mriduhas kii koti kaa samajhnaa chahie yaa attas kii koti kaa
 Other categories like Hasit, Kidnapped etc
 should be taken into account
 mriduhas ke do bhi kiye ja sakate hai, ek he gupt haas jiskaa anand man hi man liya jaataa he or doosraa he sfoot haas jiskaa muskaraahat aadi ke rup main anya jan bhi darshan kar sakate hai
 Two distinctions can also be made of attahas - one is the restrained hay which is controlled by the laughing situation and the other is the amaryad hasa in which the situation is not aware of relativity
 hasya ke bhedon kaa yah vivechan sambhavat: adhik vaigyanik hoga
 Skit in the plays and the presence of the clown have created humor but have not been versatile
 subhashit ke kai shloke avashya achche ban pade hai jinamein vishay or ukti donon drushtiyon se hasya kii acchhee avatarana kii gai he
 It will not be irrelevant to give some examples
 devataaon ke sambandh kaa majaak dekhie
 The question was why did Shankar ji drink poison? The poet's answer is that bored with the condition of his family
 shankar ji kaa saanp ganesh ji ke chuuhe kii taraf jhapat rahaa he kintu swat: usapar kartikeya ji kaa mor daanv lagaae hue he
 On the other hand, the lion of Girija is keeping a watchful eye on Ganesh ji's gajamastak and Girija ji is also frantically keeping a soutiadaah from the Ganges
 samarth hokar bhi bechaare shankar ji is besangi gruhasthi se kaise paar pate, isliye uubakar jehar pi liya
 Tridev does not sleep on the bed
 jaan padataa he khatmalon se ve bhi bhaybheet ho chuke hai
 The son-in-law considers his mother-in-law a matter of essence, but still what rudeness does he expect to get his worship done or see in the following verses
 donon hi shloke paryaapt kavyagunayukt hai
 The more you analyze, the more you will enjoy: parann priy ho ki praan, isapar kavi kaa nishkarsh suniye- Raja Bhoj had announced that the one who created the new verse would get one lakh rupees in the prize, but no one was able to get the award because the meritorious courtier Pandit would repeat the new verse as soon as he heard it and thus declare it old
 kinvadanti ke anusaar kalidas ne nimna shloke sunaakar boli band kar di thi
 In the verse, the poet has claimed that the king should free the father from ninety-nine million jewels and take the evidence of the pandits on it
 yadi panditgan kahen ki yah daawa unhen vidit nahin he to phir is nae shloke kii rachana ke liye ek lakh die hi jaaen
 The "kaisa Chhakaaya" sense of it is embodied with great beauty: hindi ke virgthakaal, bhaktikaal or reetikaal praaia: padyon ke hi kaal rahe hai
 In this long period, the compositions of humor have been rare, but they have often been in the form of retail
 tulsidas ji ke ramcharimanas kaa naradamoh prasang shivvivaah prasang, parashuram prasang aadi or surdaas ji ke sursagar kaa makhanchori prasang, uddhav-gopi-samvaad prasang aadi alabatta hasya ke achche udhaaharan prastut karte hai
 The following verse of Tulsidas ji, in which a funny pinch has been made on the Shringarlalasa of Jarajarjar ascetics, is unique in its verses- birbal ke chutkule, laal bujhakkad ke latake, ghaagh or bhaddari kii sukhtiyaan, giradhar kaviry or gang ke chand, benny kaviraj ke bhadauve tathaa or bhi kai rachanaayen is kaal kii prasiddh hai
 Bharatjeevan Press published some compilation of retail comedies of this period in its "bharova collection"
 is kaal main, visheshat: daan ke prasang ko lekar, kuch maarmik rachanaayen hui hai jinaki rochakata aaj bhi kam nahin kahi ja sakati
 See example - ek sum ne sankat main tuladaan karnaa kabool kar liya tha
 For that, look at his tricks to lose weight - vartmaan kaal main hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyakti karne kii shaileyon kaa bahut vistaar hua he
 In this era, along with poetry, many genres of prose have also developed
 pramukh hai naatak tathaa ekanki, upanyaas tathaa kahaniyaan, evam niabandh
 In all these genres, abundant literature is written and is being written to suit the humor
 pratibhashali lekhakon ne padya ke saath hi gadhy kii vividh vidhaon main bhi apni hasyarasvardhini rachanaayen prastut kii hai
 The most famous litterateur of the early days of this era is Bharatendu Babu Harishchandra
 inke naatakon main vishuddh hasyaras kam, vagvaidagdhya kuch adhik or uphaas paryaapt maatra main paaya jaataa he
 "vaidiki Violence Violence Na Bhavati", "andher Nagri" etc
 are his comedies
 unka "chuuran kaa lataka" prasiddh he
 Lala Srinivasa Das, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Radhakrishnadas, Premaghan, Balakrishna Bhatt etc
 of his era have also composed comedies
 pratapanarayan mishra ne "kalikauthuk roopak" naamak sundar prahasan likhaa he
 His poem titled "budhapa" is a masterpiece of pure humor
 us samay angreji rajya apane gaurav par tha jisaki pratyaksh aalochana khatre se khaali nahin thi
 Therefore, litterateurs, especially satire and derision were the way to go and tried to awaken the reformist social consciousness through sipa, hajo, quibble, satire etc
 bhaaratendukaal ke baad mahaviraprasad dvivedi kaal aayaa jisane hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyanjana pranaaliyon kaa kud or adhik parishkar evam vistaar kiya
 In plays, the purpose of humor, which used to play an antecedent or a sequel to the main story, often ended in the Dwivedi period, and the subject was no longer necessary for the genre of humor
 kavy main "sargau narak thekana naahin" sadrush rachanaayen saraswati aadi patrikaon main saamne ai
 Balmukund Gupta and Pt
 Jagannath Prasad Chaturvedi were good writers of humor in that era
 pratham ne "bhashaa kii ansthirataa" naamak apni lekhamala "atmaram" naam se likhi or duusare sajjan ne "nirankushta-nidarshan" naamak lekhamala "mansaram" naam se
 Both of them have clashed with Dwivedi in these garlands and his discussion of this idea remained for a long time among the literati
 balmukund gupt ji kaa shivashambhu kaa chittha, chandradhar sharma guleri kaa kachuva dharm, mishrabandhu or badrinath bhatta ji ke anek naatak, shri harishankar sharma ke niabandh, naatak aadi, ganga prasad shrivastav or ugr ji ke anek prahasan or anek kahaniyaan, apane apane samay main jansadharan main khub samaadrut hui

 We can call Annapurnanand Verma the special writer of humor
 unke "mahakavi chachcha", "meri hazaamat," "magan rahu chola", mangal mod", "man mayur" sabhi suruchipurna hai
 In the present period, Upendranath Ashk has written many new ideas like "lift the curtain, drop the curtain" etc
 dow ramkumar verma kaa ekanki sangrah "rimjhim" is kshetra main mile kaa pathar mana gaya he
 He has given good samples of smite humor

 rituvigyaan yaa mausam vigyaan kai vidhaon ko samete hue vigyaan he jo vayumandal kaa adhyayan karata he
 In meteorology, the process of weather and weather forecast are the focus of the study
 mausam vigyaan kaa itihaas hajaaron varsh purana he kintu attharahavin shatee tak isamen khaas pragati nahin ho saki thi
 In the nineteenth century, the observation of weather data in different countries gained momentum
 beesvin shatee ke uttarardh main mausam kii bhavishyavaanee ke liye computer ke istemaal se is kshetra main kranti aa gayi
 In the study of meteorology, observation of some variables of the Earth's atmosphere is very important; These variables are temperature, air pressure, water vapor or humidity etc
 in charon kaa maan va inke parivartan kii dar bahut had tak mausam kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 Meteorology is the science of the atmosphere
 aadhunik rituvigyaan main vayumandal main honevaali bhautik ghatnaon kaa tathaa unase sambhddha upalagole or jalgole kii ghatnaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The subject of meteorology, so far as it relates to the seasonal phenomena of the lower atmosphere, can be most conveniently described in the following four parts: yantric rituvigyaan jiskaa sambandh un prekshanyantron tathaa prekshanvidhiyon se he jinke dwaara vayumandal kii rituprabhavak avasthaaon kii soochna praapt kii jaati he
 Physical and dynamic meteorology in which qualitative and quantitative analysis of observed weather events is done

 The direction and velocity of the wind is observed
 disha vah lee jaati he jis ore se pawan aata he or diksuchak ke 16 athwa 32 binduon main ankit kii jaati he
 Velocity is measured by a windmeter and expressed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour or meters per second

 Since ancient times man has been influenced by many events of the season and climate
 vayuvigyaan ke pracheenatam granth aristotle rachit 'metiarologica' tathaa unke shishyon kii pawan tathaa ritu sambandhi rachanaayen hai
 In the next two thousand years after Aristotle, there was not much progress in meteorology
 17veen tathaa 18veen shatabdi main mukhyat: yantraprayog tathaa gas aadi ke niyam sthapit hue
 In the same period, the thermometer was invented by Galilee Galilei in 1607 and Evangelista Torricelli invented the air pressure meter in 1643
 in avishkaron ke pashchaat san 1659 main vaayal ke niyam kaa avishkaar hua
 In 1735, George Hadley presented an explanation of commercial air, and in it Hadley presented an explanation of commercial air and firstly included the effect of the Earth's rotation on atmospheric winds
 jab san 1783 main antony levociye ne vayumdal kii vaastavik prakruti kaa gyaan praapt kar liya or san 1800 main jon dalton ne vayumandal main jalawaashp ke parivartanon par or vaayu ke prasar tathaa vayumandaleey sanghanan ke sambandh par prakaash daalaa tabhi aadhunik rituvigyaan kaa aadhaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the 19th century, development took place mostly in the field of brief meteorology
 anek deshon ne rituvaigyanik sansthaayen sthapit kii or ritu vedhashalas kholin
 During this period, substantial progress was also made in the direction of weather forecasting

 The dry air in the lower atmosphere consists of a mixture of several gases, mainly nitrogen 78 percent, oxygen 21 percent, argon 0
93 percent and carbon dioxide 0
03 percent
 in gaison ke atirikt kuch anya gaisen bhi hoti hai, jaise hydrogen tathaa ozone
 The mixing of dry air by continuous mixing of the lower atmosphere by winds and by vertical convection is so irreversible that the atomic mass of dry air remains constant at 28
96 for at least 20 km altitude; That is, the density of air is 1
276 3 grams per cubic cent
 Occurs when the air pressure is 1,000 millibars and the temperature is 0 ° C
 vayumandal main ozone kii upasthiti faular tathaa stret ne varnakramdarshi yantra dwaara pramanit kii thi
 This has also been proved by Dobson's observations and it has also been learned that ozone is found in a confined level at an altitude of about 30 to 40 km from the ground floor
 in oonchaai par ozone kii upasthiti mausami paristhitiyon ke liye kuch mahatvapurn he
 The discovery of Dobson has shown that there is a close correlation between the pressure at 10 km altitude and the amount of ozone
 vayumandal main keval jalawaashp hi aisa avyav he jisaki bhautik avasthaa kaa parivartan saamaanya vayumandaleey paristhitiyon main hota rahata he
 Therefore, the percentage volume of water vapor in the atmosphere keeps increasing greatly
 vayumandal main jalawaashp kaa ghatana badhanaa rituvigyaan ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 Evaporation and condensation of water is important not only because they transport water from one place to another, but also because evaporation of water requires absorption of latent heat
 yah ant main pun: prakat hokar vaayu ko tab ushn karne ke kaam main aati he jab jalawaashp kaa phir se jalbindu tathaa him main sanghanan hota he
 Although nitrogen gas is the main ingredient of ammonia, nitric acid and nitrates and these substances are very important in gunpowder etc
, this gas remains completely inert in the atmosphere
 yah to vayumandal ke adhik mahatvapurn avyav oxijan gas ko, jo vayumandal kaa lagbhag paanchavaan bhaag hoti he, keval tanu kar detii he
 The air pressure of any place is generated by the weight of the air above it, so the difference between the pressures of two different heights is equal to the weight of the unit's transverse section of air between these two heights
 yadi yah daab kaa antar bich kii hawa ke bhaar se yatharth rup main santulit na ho to us vayustar ko upar kii ore yaa neeche kii ore twaran praapt hota he
 The situation in which the pressure difference and air load are balanced, or that there is no vertical acceleration other than gravitational acceleration, is called a situation of hydrostatic equilibrium
 yah paristhiti kisi bhi str par oonchaai ke saath dabaparivartan kii dar kaa parichay detii he
 If there is a pressure difference between two pressures and there is a vertical distance between two levels, density and accelerated gravity, then is sameekaran ko dravasthaitik sameekaran kehete hai
 Gravitational acceleration decreases only slightly due to different latitudes and altitudes, but due to pressure, heat, and moisture, the density of air decreases in greater quantity
 isliye vayumandal main urdhwadhar dabpravanta atyant parivartansheel hoti he
 Two formulas are used to calculate pressure under 68 km
 pehle sutara kaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he jab maanak taapmaana lesp dar shunya na ho
 Others are used when the standard heat lapse rate is zero
 pehla sameekaran: Second equation: jahaan Or converted to English units: jahaan The normative method of measuring height is that by measuring the pressure and temperature by the formula given above, the difference of height can be obtained and if the accuracy is required then the amount of humidity can also be used
 pramanik tungatamapi isi sutara par aadhaarit he
 Daily changes in the temperature of the air are produced due to the heat received by the sun during the day and the cooling of the earth by radiation at night
 nunatam taap suryoday se kuch pehle hota he or adhiktam taap tisare pahar main hota he
 This daily change in air temperature quickly takes place in the free atmosphere above the surface
 prithvi ke adhiktar bhaagon main 5,000 foot se adhik kii unchaaiyon par tathaa registani pradeshon main 10,000 foot kii oonchaai par taap kaa dainik paraas 2° yaa 3° centegrade se adhik nahin paaya gaya he
 The surface and atmosphere get almost entirely from solar radiation
 anya akashiya pindon se garmi bahut hi kam maatra main milti he
 Measurements of solar energy are done regularly at the Smithsonian Institution's tara-physics-observatory and at many other mountain top observatories and the accuracy of these measurements is excellent by one percent
 prithvi or surya kii madhyamansaur duuri par yah saura aatapan urja vayumandal main pravisht hokar anshat: avasheshit hone ke pehle lagbhag 1
94 gram calories prati minute varg centimetre hoti he; yahan pratibandh yah he ki surya kii kirane us varg centimetre par abhilambat: paden
 This quantity is called solar constant
 saura niyatank ke maan main pai gai aniyamit ghat bad ek pratishat se bhi kam rahati hai; ye prekshantrutiyon ke kaaran ho sakati hai
 In addition to these irregular reliefs, a real and large relief has also been found, which can be even longer in the eleven-year sun-stigma cycle by about a percentage
 parantu ye sab ucchavachan itane laghu hai ki vayumandaleey ushm santulan ke sambandh main yah maan liya ja saktaa he ki prithvi par saura urja 1
94 gram calories prati varg centimetre prati minute padati he
 It is estimated that 43 percent of the solar energy is reflected and scattered and the combined power of scattering is called albedo
 yah 43 pratishat he
 The remaining 57 percent of energy, which is effective insolation, provides an average of 57 heat units to the surface and atmosphere
 in 57 ushma ikaayiyon main se keval ek laghu bhaag kaa vayumandal, mukhyat: nichle staron main jalawaashp dwaara or kuch kam pariman main upree samtap mandal main ozone dwaara, avasorana kar letaa he
 The reason for evaporation and condensation in the atmosphere is the decrease in the ability of the air to absorb water vapor, that is, hot or cold air
 saadhaarant: vayumandal main jalawaashp-maatra santrupt maatra se kam hoti he, visheshkar bhootal ke sameep jahaan vayumandal kaa prabhavakaari aatapan adhiktam hota he
 Much of the moisture in the air, which keeps the water cycle running in the atmosphere, is obtained by evaporation
 jaise-jaise jal vashpit hota he, taise taise vah vayumandal main visarit hota rahata he
 The seasonal actions by evaporation in the atmosphere are not relatively significant
 drishy bhaap kii uttapati bhi vaashpan dwaara honevaali mausami kriya he
 Very cold or relatively cold humid air becomes highly saturated due to the rapid evaporation of hot water from the surface
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki drishy bhaap ke rup main nami kaa turant sanghanan ho jaataa he jiske kaaran sthir hawa main ghanaa koharaa ban jaataa he
 Condensation occurs on an open surface when the temperature of that surface is lower than the temperature of the surrounding air's dew point
 is prakaar ke sanghanan ke udhaaharan garam mausam main paae jate hai
 For example, even though the relative humidity of air is sufficiently below 100 percent, the vapor of the air condenses outside a glass filled with ice water
 Similarly, on a clean Pacific night, the condensation of dew occurs on those ground objects Radiation cools to lower temperatures due to the dew of the surrounding air, frost settles on surfaces that are cooler than freezing, even if free Why should the temperature of the air be much higher than the freezing point? jab vayumandal ke bheetar chote chhot jalbinduon ke rup main sanghanan hota he to prashn yah uthta he ki yah prakram kis prakaar prarambh hota he
 Experimentation has proved that condensation does not occur as a burning point in completely insoluble air, even if the vapor pressure in it is ten times the saturation pressure
 prathit hota he ki jalawaashp kaa sanghanan prarambh karne ke liye kisi prakaar ke kanon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo shuddh vaayu main upasthit nahin hote
 This type of particle is called condensation nucleus
 pareekshan se gyaat hua he ki vaayu main jalaakarshi padaarthon ke nanhen kan, jaise samudri namak ke kan, sanghanan nabhikon kaa kaary karte hai
 In places where the smoke of factories contaminates the atmosphere, small particles of oxides of substances such as smoke sulfur, phosphorus, etc
 become condensation nuclei
 saadhaarant: nichle kshobhamandal ke kuhare or badalon main prati ghan centimetre sau se das hajaar tak nanhen jalbindu hote hai
 The topic of how clouds or second precipitation forms are formed in the clouds is still a matter of doubt
 kadachit ye bahut se chote-chote meghkanon ke sangyojan dwaara banate hai
 The combination would be caused by the mixing of air currents and the rise of air
 bade bade bindonvali teevr varsha ke bare main sweekrut siddhant yah he ki ye bindu tab banate hai jab himamanibh badalon ke upree bhaagon main pahunch jate hai jahaan ati sheet jalakaran vidyaman rahete hai
 This theory was formulated by T
 Vargaran
 mulat: vayumandal kaa saamaanya sanchaar bhumadhyi tathaa dhraveey deshon ke bich kshaitij taapapravanta ke kaaran utpann hota he
 The general communication of a type of atmosphere is a comprehensive bird's eye view of the atmosphere's movement and its actions
 yadi dirghakaal ke dainik mausami nakshon kaa pareekshan kiya jaae to yah gyaat hota he ki unamem pravaah ke rup do prakaar ke hote hai : Short-lived rapid intermittent cyclone and depression
 is prakaar ke bhanvar prarambh hone ke baad ek din se lekar ek maas tak ke kaal main samaapt hote hai or phir nakshon se bilkul adrishy ho jate hai
 These are known as secondary communications
 dirghajivi tathaa dhire-dhire chalanevaale bhanvar
 These are also antidote or cyclonic in nature, but remain almost fixed for a long time
 ye praathmik sanchaar kehalaate hai
 Figure 1 and 2 give the average oceanic pressure lines on Earth during the months of January and July
 yah spasht he ki donon chitron main dakshini golardh kii kuch baaten ek jaisi hai
 In both months, there is a relatively small, but very uniform, monolithic tropic of pressure in the entire equatorial region of the Earth
 janvarimas main yah katibandh bumadhyarekha ke kuch uttar kii ore he, parantu july maas main yaa to thik us rekha par he yaa thodaa dakshin kii ore
 It is a low pressure tropical Pacific and warm weather tropical region known as Doldrum on the sea
 is puure katibandh ko ham bumadhyarekhiy alp-daab-katibandh kah sakate hai
 In subtropical countries, the H-wide monolithic high pressure tropics occurs in both January and July, but in January, it is slightly severed by small minor regions over Australia and South Africa
 yah chaudaa katibandh uposhnavalayik adhidaab katibandh kehalaata he jo donon golardho main saamaanya sanchaar kaa ek sthaayee swaroop he
 In the south of the subtropical overflow zone, the pressure drops southward and becomes the lowest over the continent of Antarctica

 uposhnavalayik adhi-daab-katibandh is golardh main purnataya bhinn prakaar kaa he
 In the month of January, it lives about 25 ° –35 ° north on the seas
 parantu mahadwipon ke upar unche akshanshon main iskaa sambandh bahut adhik daab kii pranaaliyon se rahata he
 These pressure systems are quite different in character and it is therefore appropriate to consider the subtropical overpressure to be confined to the oceans
 janvari maas ke nakshe par upottaradhruviya alpadaab-katibandh spashtatya dikhaai detaa he
 Iceland and the Alushian Islands are the two largest low-lying regions in the tropics, which sequentially extend over the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean

 Secondary communications are of two types: direct thermal and dynamic or propitious
 pratyaksht: ushmiya adhidaab tathaa alpadaab nichle vayumandal ke kisi sthanvishesh ke thanda yaa garam hone se nirmit hote hai
 Both dynamic overload and low pressure are formed due to the reciprocal mechanical actions of normal circulating airs

 The word monsoon derives from the seasonal Arabic word and was initially used to refer to the winds of the Arabian sea that run about six months north-east and six months south-west
 ab yah shabd kuch anya pawanon ke liye bhi lagu ho gaya he jo varsh kii vibhinn dishaao main pratikul dishaao se dirghakaalik tathaa niyamit rup se chalati hai
 The primary reason for the movement of these winds is the seasonal difference of temperatures in land and sea areas

 Monsoon is called Pavas in Hindi
 bumadhyarekha ke sameep taap ke ritujanit parivartan saamanyat: pawas ke vikaas ke liye bahut chote hote hai
 At high latitudes, where westerly wind moves, and in polar regions, gaps made of variations of land and sea heat are only able to slightly alter Earthwide wind communications
 aisi paristhiti main pawas ke vikaas ke liye sabase adhik anukool pradesh ushnavalay ke sameep madhya akshanshon main hote hai
 The amount of humidity present in the winds running towards the site and the design of the site have a great influence on the rainfall
 vibhinn ghatnaon kii uparyukt sangati ke kaaran pawas kaa adhiktam vikaas purv tathaa dakshin asia par hota he or in pradeshon ke bahut se bhaagon main dakshin-pashchim se chalanevaale greeshm ritu ke vrishtimaan pavaspawan jalwaayu ke mahatvapurn ang hai
 Holistic conditions occur in North Australia, in parts of Western, Southern and Eastern Africa, and also in parts of North Africa and Chile, but to a lesser extent

 In the middle of the month of June, on reaching the western edge of India, Pavas crosses the southern region and then reaches India, Burma and all parts of the Bay of Bengal
 dakshin pradesh ke dakshini bhaagon ke atirikt, jahaan pashchimi ghaaton kii pahadiyon kii aad ke kaaran ye pawan pahunch nahin pate, monsoon kaal main bharat ke sab bhaagon main baari varsha hoti he
 This rainfall is almost entirely sustainable
 isaki pragati ke liye mukhyat: bhootal kii tapan tathaa uski oonchaai se vaashp kaa jal main roopantarit hona niyantrit hota he
 The impact of the lifting of the ground is well-known in the Western Ghats, in the Khasi Hills, in the Arakan Peaks and on the Himalayan Mountains

 Sometimes the Ganga Ghati basin receives very wide rainfall for a long time
 yah lagaataar varsha praaia: un uthle avadaabon ke kaaran hoti he jo mukhya pavasi alpadaab kii ore pashchim disha main mand gati se chalati hai
 The power of Indian power keeps on decreasing
 jab pawas teevr hota he to bharat ke adhiktam bhaagon main varsha ausat se bahut adhik ho jaati he or jab pawas halkaa hota he to varsha nune hoti he
 The northward movement of the monsoon is limited due to the Himalayan Mountains, but the flow of the monsoon is very variable in Burma, Thailand, Indochina and South China
 is prayadweep ke aksh ke nikat sthit unchi pahadiyaan ghaney sanvahan badalon se dhaki rahati hai or yahan bahudhaa varsha hoti rahati he
 During the beginning of the monsoon, there is a steep rise in the amount and frequency of rainfall, which are very important for the life of Indian farmers

 After 1970, there has been a drought in many areas of Mauritania and displaced people from those areas often come to Nuakshot, which has increased both congestion and scarcity
 yah ek mahatvapurn bandargah he or nuakshot vishvavidhyalay bhi yaheen sthit he
 Nuakshot is derived from the word 'nawakshoot' in Berber languages which means 'place of winds'

 It is also known as Industrial Revolution
 yah silsilaa britain se armbh hokar puure vishwa main fail gaya
 The term "industrial revolution" was first used in this context by Arnold Tynby in his book "lectures on the Industrial Revolution in England" in 1844
 audyogic kranti kaa sutarapaat vastra udyog ke mashinikaran ke saath armbh hua

 As a result, manufacturing of machines used in other industries gained momentum
 unnisvi shatabdi main yah puure pashchimi europe tathaa uttari america main fail gayi
 Different historians seem to consider the period of industrial revolution differently, while some historians are not ready to accept it as a revolution

 The economic life of the colonies became the fulfillment of the industrial needs of the "original nation"
 swatantra astitv ke sthaan par paravalamban unki visheshta ban gai
 In countries where industrial changes took place, they were freed from human bonds, they could go to new places in search of new businesses, they could produce more wealth
 kintu is viksit sampatti kaa shrey kisi ho or usak pratifal koun praapt kare, ye prashn uthne lage
 How much work, when and at what salary, should the workers handling the machines operating 24 hours, these questions started to be considered from the point of view of humanity

 These nations, after becoming independent, are trying to get limited and capital support from other rich nations, but they do not want to get into any political bond in return for such assistance
 in rashtron kaa moolbhoot uddeshy apane yahan usee prakaar ke parivartan karnaa he jaise parivartan audyogic kranti ke saath europe main hue
 But it is clear that basically these new nations have to develop the means to obtain raw materials for themselves and to sell the finished goods according to their limits

 bhartiya kaarigaron dwaara niryaat maal arab, misr, rome, france tathaa england ke bazaaron main bikta tha or bharatvarsh se vyapaar karne ke liye videshi rashtron main hode si lagi rahati thi
 The East India Company was founded in England in 1600 with this aim
 yah company bharat main bana hua maal england le jaakar bechati thi
 Indian goods, especially fabrics made of silk and velvet, were much preferred in England; Even the Queen of England considered her pride in wearing Indian clothes
 parantu yah sthiti bahut dinon tak bani na rah saki
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, goods began to be mass produced in England and sold in the colonies

 Indian artisans were weak and scattered; Hence they were unable to compete with machine made items

 Thus, the industrial revolution resulted in the destruction of Indian business and millions of artisans started starving
 audyogic kranti, jo england ke liye vardaan swaroop thi, bhartiya udyogon ke liye abhishaap siddh hui
 Modernization of India began in 1850 AD

 Siddhartha's father was Shuddhodana, the king of the Shakyas
 paramparaagat katha ke anusaar, siddharth kii mata mahamaya unke janm ke kuch der baad mar gayi thi
 It is said that 8 sages were invited to name him, all told 2 possibilities, they will become a great king, they will become a monk or parivrajaka

 The Shakyas had their own union
 bees varsh kii aayu hone par har shakya tarun ko shakyasang main dikshit hokar sangh kaa sadsy bananaa hota tha
 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa

 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill

 At the age of 35, he attained Bodhi and became a Buddha
 unka pahila dharmopadesh varanasi ke paas sarnath me tha
 For the rest of his 45 years, Gautama Buddha gave his sermon around the river Ganges, to both the rich and the poor
 unhone do sanyaasiyon ke sangh kii bhi sthapana jinhone buddha ke dharmopadesh ko failaana jari rakhaa
 Tripitaka is the main text of Buddhism

 Buddha has told the four non-truths

 There is sorrow in birth, in old age, in sickness, in death, in getting away from loved ones, in things with dislike, in not getting desire, in everything
 trishna, yaa chahat, dukh kaa kaaran he or fir se sasharir karke sansar ko jari rakhti he

 Template: Main: Octagonal route buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: 1
 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3
 samyak vaak : hanikaarak baaten or jhut na bolnaa 4
 samyak karm : hanikaarak karmon ko na karnaa 5
 samyak jeevika : koi bhi pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se hanikaarak vyapaar na karnaa 6
 samyak prayaas : apane aap sudharne kii koshish karnaa 7
 samyak smriti : spasht gyaan se dekhne kii maansik yogyata paane kii koshish karnaa 8

 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi

 The knowledge found from Gautama Buddha is called Bodhi
 mana jaataa he ki bodhi paane ke baad hi sansar se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 Bodhi can be attained only by the perfection of all the parameters, the complete understanding of the four Aryan truths and the prevention of karma
 is samay, lobh, dosha, moh, avidya, trishna or atmaa main vishwaas sab gaayab ho jate he
 There are three levels of Bodhi: ावकravakodhodhi, each Bodhādhi and Samyakasobodhi
 samyaksambodhi bodh dharm kii sabase unnat adarsh maani jaati he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists
 har ghatana multah shunaya hoti he
 However, humans, who have the power of knowledge, can attain nirvana by abandoning Trishna, which is the cause of sorrow, turning the power destroyed in Trishna into knowledge and meditation
 is duniya main sab kuch kshanik he or nashwar he
 Nothing permanent
 parantu vaidic mat se virodh he
 The soul means 'I'

 What people consider to be a soul is an uninterrupted flow of consciousness
 aatma kaa sthaan man ne liya he
 Buddha has told how the creation of the universe in brahma-jala Sutra
 sristi kaa nirmaan hona or nasht hona baar-baar hota he
 Ishwara or Mahabrahma does not create the universe because the world operates on the rule of Pratyatmasutpad i
e
 the working-sense
 bhagwaan buddha ke anusaar, manushyon ke du:kha or sukh ke liye karm jimmedaar he, ishwar yaa mahabrahma nahi
 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable
 shoonyata mahayan buddha sampradaay kaa pradhan darshan he
 He values people of his own sect
 buddha dharm kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he
 Grief does not mean pessimism, but relativism and realism
 buddha, dhamm or sangh buddha dharm ke teen triratne hai

 buddha dharm kaa antim lakshya he sampoorn maanav samaaj se dukh kaa ant
 "I teach only one substance - there is sorrow, there is a cause of sorrow, there is a cure for sorrow, and there is a way to restrain sorrow"

 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped

 sadiyon pehle isi sthaan se unhone dharm-chakra-pravartan prarambh kiya tha
 Buddhist followers also consider Sarnath's clay, stones and kankars as sacred

 There is a structural connection between nationalism and the history of the modern state
 solahavin or satrahavin sadi ke aas-paas europe main aadhunik rajya kaa udai hua jisane rashtrawaad ke ubhaar main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 This form of state differed from its earlier forms
 isaki satta kendrikrut, samprabhu or avibhajit thi
 In contrast, in medieval Europe, the state was divided rather than being held by any one sovereign ruler or government
 aadhunik rajya ne satta kaa yah bantwaaraa khatm kar diya jiske aadhaar par rashtrawaad kaa vichaar punap sakaa
 To understand the principle of nationalism, it is necessary to understand the developments that created the conditions for the birth of the modern state
 madhya yug main samraaton or rajwanshon kaa astitv tha, par unhen kshaitij rup se carch ke saath or stambheey rup se saamanton or soobedaaron ke saath satta main saajhedaari kerani padati thi
 The church was so powerful that it was as powerful as the rulers and sometimes more than them
 chauthi sadi main roman samraat constetin dwaara isai dharm apana lene ke baad se carch kii shakti main lagaataar badhotaree hoti chali gayi thi
 As a state religion, Christianity not only spread to every corner of Europe, but also spread to Turkey and Russia in the east
 chhathin sadi tak europe main jagah-jagah catholic carch or hukmaranon ke bich parasparavyapee satta kii sanrachanaayen viksit ho gayin
 The claim of the kings was that they are ruling by divine order and on the other hand the Church held political reins in the non-religious sense to an extent
 carch ke paas praja par tex lagane tak ke adhikaar the
 This uneasy relationship between the church and the king hindered the rise of an almighty kind of state power
 duusari taraf samraat ko shreneekram ke aadhaar par sanchalit pranali ke aadhaar par taqatvar kulinon or saamanton ke saath bhi satta main saajhedaari kerani padati thi
 at political and economic levels divided the masses and the owner class into lords and land slaves
 sthaneey str par lard apane jagirdaar par or jagirdaar apane adhinsth jagirdaar par hukum chalaata tha
 Indeed, the then circumstances of Europe prevented the formation of a centralized political community within a certain territory and population
 parivahan or sanchaar ke networkon kaa abhaav bhi ek vajah thi jiske kaaran satta main hissedari karnaa ek majaburi thi
 Due to the constant wars, win-loss and tendency to form a separate state, the boundaries of the rulers were constantly changing

 But this political change did not affect the daily life of the people

 The transition to this decentralized situation began with the consolidation of the Tudor in England and the Bourbon dynasties in France

 Due to the wealth earned by trade, these dynasties did not depend as much on their vassals for income

 In place of the feudal capitalist capitalists came

 There are similar features in today's modern state

 However, within this totalitarian character, circumstances existed for the establishment of a 'nation' with cultural, linguistic and ethnic symmetry
 saamanti varg ko pratisthapit karne vaala vanik burjwa raajaaon kaa ahm raajnneetik sahyogi ban chukaa tha
 The philosophy of nationalism as a subjective feeling began to flourish among the elite of this class

 They began to dominate the assemblies and parliaments throughout Western Europe

 In the eighteenth century when feudalism was declining and Europe was going through a period of industrial revolution, various sections of the capitalist class united under the ideology of nationalism
 unhone khud ko ek samroop or ghanishtha ekta main bandhe raajnneetik samudaay ke pratinidhiyon ke taur par dekha
 The task of imposing antiquity on this spirit of the nation was completed at the hands of German Romani nationalism
 khud ko nesan kah kar yah varg aadhunik rajya se raajnneetik saudebaazi kar saktaa tha
 On the other hand, ordinary people outside this class used the idea of nationalism to unite themselves against the tyrannical character of the state
 janata ko aisa isliye karnaa padaa ki poonjipati varg ke samarthan se vanchit hoti ja rahi rajshahiyaan adhikadhik nirankush or atyaachaari hone lagi thim
 The public was repeatedly forced to take to the streets, which resulted in epoch-making events such as the French Revolution
 kahana na hoga ki hukmaranon ke kilaaf jan-vidrohon kaa itihaas bahut purana tha, par attharahavin or unnisvin sadi ke europe main yah golbandi rashtrawaad ke jhande tale ho rahi thi

 kisi bhi sthaneey vidroh kaa laabh uthaa kar poonjipati varg rajshahi ke kilaaf sampoorn rashtravaadi andolan kii shuruyaat kar detaa tha
 This history shows how the decentralized power of the pre-modern European state was transformed into a totalitarian state
 phir vah rajya dhire-dhire rashtravaadi andolanon ke dabaav main simit kism ke sanvaidhanik rajya main viksit hua
 By the end of the nineteenth century, nationalism became a big factor for political rights for the capitalist class as well as for the general public
 yah maananaa galat hoga ki rashtrawaad kaa vichaar puure europe main ek hi tarah se failaa
 In France it was characterized by violent public participation, while in England it expressed itself in a relatively peaceful parliamentary manner
 jo samrajya bahujaateey or bahubhashi the, ve pehle bahurashtriya rajya bane or baad main kai hisson main tut gayi
 But on the other hand, nationalism also provided the rationale for keeping some multilingual and multi-ethnic states united
 rashtravaadi vichaar jaise-jaise europea zamin se aage bad kar asia, africa or laathini america main pahunchaa, uski europe se bhinn kismein viksit hone lageen
 The anti-colonial liberation struggles in these areas led to nationalist sentiments of victory

 Even before this, many mathematicians wrote geometries, but after all that no one has been able to match the geometry that Euclid wrote, and no book has been written in the world till today without changing in the field of science

 The periodic table is a system of representing chemical elements as a table with their corresponding characteristics
 aavart sarini main rasinic tatva parmaanu kramank ke badhate kram main sajaaye gayi hai tathaa aavart, praathmik samooh, dwitiyak samooh main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 The current periodic table contains 118 known elements
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 a few months later, German scientist Lothar Meyer also independently created the periodic table
 mendeleyev kii sarini se alfred varnor ne aavart sarini kaa vartmaan swaroop nirmit kiya
 In 1952, Costa Rica scientist Gil Chaveri introduced a new form of the periodic table that was based on the electronic structure of elements
 rasayan shastriyon ke liye aavart sarini atyant mahatvapurn evam upyogi he
 Because of this, memorizing only the properties of lesser elements works because the properties in a group or a period in the periodic table change in a certain order and in a rational way
 neeche aavart sarini kaa aadhunik rup dikhaaya gaya he jisamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai- Lanthanide and actinide have been kept separate from other metals in this prevailing arrangement of the periodic table
 vistrut or ati-vistrut aavart saranion main f-block or g-block dhaatuon ko bhi ek saath prabandhit kiya jaataa he
 Categories of elements in the periodic table tatwon ke parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhi kram main krambaddh karne par kshaitij kataren praapt hoti hai jinhen 'aavart' kehete hai
 According to the periodic law, when the elements are decorated in horizontal lines in increasing order of atomic weight, the elements having salmon properties are present in the same vertical column, these are called 'squares'
 aavart sarini ke urdhv kataron ko 'samooh' yaa 'varg' kaha jaataa he
 Groups are considered to be the most important in terms of classification of elements
 kuch samoohon main, tatv samaan gun darshaate hai
 The names of these groups are alkaline elements, alkaline earth metals, halogen, nictogen, chalcogen and inert gas
 aavart sarini ke kshaitij kataron ko aavart kehete hai
 Although groups are considered to be more important in the classification of elements, then there are many sites in the periodic table where the importance of periodic is greater
 udhaaharan ke rup main di-block yaa sankraman dhaatuon or epa-block ko liya ja saktaa he
 Modern periodic table is also called long form of periodic table
 isamen 18 varg tathaa 7 aavart hai
 Atoms of all elements of a single class have the same number of electrons in the outermost orbit
 is kaaran kisi ek varg ke sabhi tatwon ke mukhya gun samaan hote hai
 On the basis of valence electrons, the elements are divided into 4 sections - s, p, d, f
 sabase pehle roosi rasayan-shastri mendlif ne san 1869 main aavart niyam prastut kiya or tatwon ko ek sarini ke rup main prastut kiya
 according to this, arthath yadi tatwon ko parmaanu bhaar ke vruddhikram main rakhaa jaay to wo tatv jinke gun samaan hote hai ek nishchit avadhi ke baad aate hai
 Mendeleev tried to demonstrate the aspect of recurring physical and chemical properties of elements with the help of this table
 mandelif kii aavart sarini main kul 8 varg the kyonki us samay niskriy gaison kii khoj nahin hui thi
 Later the 9th class was included in the modern periodic table after the discovery of inert gases
 is 9wein varg ko 0 kehete hai
 Classes one through eighth are represented by the Roman letters I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII
 nawein varg ko 0 dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In the last phase of its development, scientists like Raga, Werner, Bohr and Bari created the modern form of the periodic table which is in practice till the present
 inhone mendelive kii aavart sarini main upasthit shreniyon ko khatm kiya tathaa virgo kii sankhya ko 9 se badhaakar 18 kiya
 Even after this, the two main drawbacks so far are the presence of hydrogen in two places and the absence of lanthanide and actinide elements in the table
 madlif dwaara aavart sarini prastut karne ke kuch maheenon baad german vaigyanik lother meyar ne bhi swatantra rup se aavart sarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 From 1815 to 1913, it underwent a lot of reforms so that the newly invented elements could be given proper place and the table should be in accordance with the new information
 mendeleyev kii sarini se alfred varnor ne aavart sarini kaa vartmaan swaroop nirmit kiya
 In 1952, Costa Rica scientist Gil Chaveri introduced a new form of the periodic table that was based on the electronic structure of elements

 The United Nations says that the number of children below five years of age who die due to malnutrition in India is more than one million
 In South Asia, India is in the worst case of malnutrition
 Surveys conducted in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh found that children in the poorest areas of the country are still losing their lives due to starvation
 The report says that if this is taken care of, then these deaths can be prevented
 The figures the United Nations has found in India are many times more than the international level
 The United Nations has described the situation as "worrisome"
 In India, the Fight Hunger Foundation and ACF India have jointly launched a "generational Nutrition Program"
 Describing the program as vice-president of ACF in India, Rajiv Tandon said that malnutrition needs to be seen as a "medical emergency"
 At the same time, he also advocated for better policies and budget for this
 In the conference held in New Delhi, the government insisted on taking necessary steps
 Rajiv Tandon has appealed to the government to take up malnutrition as a "mission"
 He said that if Prime Minister Modi wants, he can give it a new direction
 The ACF report shows that malnutrition is a big problem in India, it has not been seen anywhere else in South Asia
 The report reads, "there is a huge burden of excessive malnutrition on Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, Backward Castes and Rural Communities in India
" While Vandana Krishna, who runs the Rajmata Jijau Mission in Maharashtra, says that the state government is trying to reduce malnutrition
 Many steps have been taken, but at the same time he also pointed out that there is still no success in the Dalit and tribal areas

 Even the World Bank has compared it to an epidemic called the Black Death

 Why is malnutrition considered so important? Why are institutions like the World Bank so worried about it? Malnutrition in general is considered a medical issue and most of us think it is a medical issue

 When hunger and poverty are not the priority of the political agenda, a large number of malnutrition emerges on the surface

 Malnutrition means lack of adequate physical development according to age and body; after one stage it also blocks the process of mental development

 As a result of this, children are immune to disease and small diseases become the cause of their death
 kuposhan vastav main gharelu khaadya asuraksha kaa sidhaa parinaam he
 Food security in general means access to food to everyone, access to food at all times and adequate food for an active and healthy life

 Due to this, a large number of children are forced into child labor or child prostitution

 Mothers have to do many household chores such as baking, fetching water, cleaning etc
 along with earning a livelihood

 Other adults in the family also consider it only the responsibility of mother

 Mid-day meals, scholarships, special schools for child laborers etc
 are helpful but cannot make up for the loss of the first 6 years

 Malnutrition in children is mainly of two types: sookhe vaala kuposhansujan vaala kuposhankuposhan ke suchak Loss of weight according to the age and height of the child
 uske haath-pair patale or kamjor hona or pet badha hona
 The child has frequent infections and becomes ill
 kuposhan or swasth ke sambadh There are more than 500 lakh families who fall in the category of very poor
 iskaa matlab yah he ki aadhi aabaadi ko do vakt kii roti bhi naseeb nahin ho paati he
 It has been proved that the lack of adequate food reduces the body's ability to fight against diseases and it soon succumbs to diseases
 janm ke samay dhai kilo se kam vajan hone par bachche ke bahut kam umr main marane kii sambhaavna teen guna bad jaati he
 Whereas the rate of deaths from measles is four hundred times higher than normal where there is more malnutrition

 Outbreak of diarrhea on malnourished children is 4 times more than normal

 Children who get caught in its clutches are prone to infectious diseases like diarrhea, measles, kukharkhansi, TB, and pneumonia
 kuposhit bacchon main ye bimaariyaan zyada gambhir hoti hai or unki avadhi lambi hone kii sambhaavna bahut zyada hoti he
 The severity of malnutrition can be correctly understood by the problem of diarrhea, although diarrhea is a common disease, which was believed to spread due to the filth in the water, but later it was found that the time of diarrhea was weaned
 Matches the period
 yah avadhi bacchon ko taral aahaar dene se lekar stanpan samaapt hone ke teen maheene baad tak chalati he
 This is the time when children are usually malnourished
 yah bhi dekha gaya he ki doodh chhudaane main dast ke teen guna adhik shikaar hote hai
 Why under-nutrition children are more susceptible to diarrhea, when biological studies were carried out, it was found that the number of bacteria increases as the immunity on the inner surface of the small intestine of children increases
 in bacteria ke kaaran utpann jahrile padaarthon se sodium ko sokhne kii prakriya dhimi pad jaati he
 The child is unable to tolerate it and the problem of diarrhea is born

 For many years, French officials struggled unsuccessfully in the slums of Paris

 He believed that his new architectural improvements would provide a new organizational solution that would improve the standard of living of the lower classes
 unka imubyel vila ek aisi hi pariyojna thi jisamen koshika jaise ghar ek ke upar ek bane hue the, inamen ek mukhya cameraa, shayan kaksh va rasoi tathaa bagichaa tha
 Not satisfied with building just a few houses, Le Corbusier began studying the entire city
 1922 main unhone 30 lakh logon kii "aadhunik nagari" kii yojana prastut kii
 At the center of this plan was the sixty-storey skyscrapers, which were steel-framed office buildings and had glass walls

 Just in the middle was a traffic center, with bus, train, and street intersections at different levels and at the top an airport
 unki yah manyata thi ki vyavsaayik hawaijahaz gagan chumbiyon ke bich utar paayenge
 Le Corbusier separated the roads from the walkways and gave cars more recognition for traffic
 kendriya gagan chumbiyon se dur jate jate chote, kam oonchaai vaale ghar shuru hote the jo ki sadak se thodi dur hariyaali main bane the, jahaan naagarik rahete the
 Le Corbusier hoped that French industrialists with political ambitions would move in this direction and give society a facelift by copying Taylorist and Fordist policies from American industries
 norma evenson na kaha he, "prastaavit shahar kuch logon ke liye ek mahatvakankshi duuradrushti thi or kuch auron ke liye prachlit naagarik vatavaran kaa ek vishaal asveekaran

 Perhaps the biggest difference between the modern city and Ojaswi Nagar was that the new idea does not have a class-based division, the houses are decided on the basis of family size, not on the basis of economic status

 in binduon ke bare main unhone apni patrika lespri novyuu or pustak vars oon architekchar main likhaa he, inkaa vikaas ve 1920 ke dashak main kar rahe the
 First, Le Corbusier built most of the structure over the ground, using pillows for support - a slab of concrete
 ye piloti ghar kaa dhaanchaa sambhalate or inaki badaulat agali do binduon ko samarthan miltaa - ek mukt diwaal, yani aisi deevaaren jinhen vazan uthaani kii zarurat na ti or vaastushilpi unhen jaise chaahe bana saktaa tha or ek khulaa farsh, yani har farsh ko jaise chaahe kamaron main baanta ja saktaa tha, deevaaron kii chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin thi
 The second floor of the Villa Savoy features long strips of windows that allow all four spaces to be seen uninterrupted
 yah khaali sthaan unki pranali kii chauthi bindu tha
 The fifth point is the garden on the roof - greenery on the roof in lieu of the greenery that the building destroyed
 nichle str se teesri manzil kii chat tak jaataa ek ramp dhaanche ko ek vaastushilpi prominede pradaan karata he
 The white tubed railing is reminiscent of the "sea ship" industrial beauty that Le Corbusier loved

 Le Corbusier used the golden ratio in his modular system to measure architectural proportions
 is pranali ko unhone vitruvius, leonardo da vinci ke "vitruvian purush", leone batista albarti or anyon ke kaam ko aage badhaane kii tarah hi mana, jo ki vaastushilp ke pradarshan or kaam ko sudhaarney main maanav sharir ke anupaaton kaa prayog karte aa rahe the
 In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier also improved the system through human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and dual units
 ve leonardo ke maanviya anupato main sunahare anupaat ke suzav ko duusari had tak le gaye
 He divided the length of the human body into two portions on the navel, based on the golden ratio, then divided these portions on the feet and throat again into the golden ratio; They used these golden ratios in the modular system
 lee corbuziye kii 1927 kii garche main vila stein, modulor pranali kaa udhaaharan bani

 1934 main unhone rome main vaastushilp par ek bhaashan diya, jiske liye unhen benito musolini ne bulaayaa tha
 In the civic scheme he sought a place from the Vichy regime and was given a place in a committee to study on urbanism

 "this plan and the restructuring plans of other cities were ignored
 is haar ke baad lee corbuziye raajnneeti se praayah dur hi rahai
 Although the politics of Lagardale and Veloi were part of fascism, anti-semitism, and post-modernism, it is difficult to say how much of Le Corbusier's involvement with all these movements
 'laa vil radius main ve ek arajanatik samaaj kii pariklpana karte hai, jisamen aarthik prashasan kii naukarshahi puri tarah se rajya kaa sthaan le leti he

 His later work at the site of construction reveals a good understanding of the complex impact of modernism, but his civil works have also been criticized by many
 takneekee itihasvid va vaastushills maseekshak louis mamford ne beete kal kaa aane vaale kal kaa shahar main kehete hai, James Howard Kunstler, a member of the neo-urbanism movement, described Lee Carbuzier's city planning plan as destructive and expensive: lee corbuziye praarambhik ucch aadhuniktaa ke agrani vaastushilpi netaa the, jinaki 1925 kii plan vaoicine thi daayen tat par paris ke puure marai jile ko tahas nahas kar ke chaudee sadakon ke bich samaan dikhne vaali gaganchumbiyaan bana dena
 It was the fate of Paris that whenever he took the plan over the next forty years, the city officials laughed at him - and Le Corbusier was self-effacing
 lekin badakismati yah he ki plan voisin yojana ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad do amareeki yojanakaaron ne lagu kiya or uski badaulat chicago kii kukhyat kabrini green rihaayshi pariyojna or usee tarah kii bisiyon or chize puure desh main paidaa huin

 In the design of the buildings, Le Corbusier opposed any type of decoration

 For many years, many architects worked with him in Le Corbusier's studio and many of them became well-known themselves, such as the painter-architect Nadir Afonso who imbibed Le Corbusier's ideas into his beauty theory

 The destruction of traditional urban spaces became more accepted through the ideas of Le Corbusier, as this new city was built with low density, low-cost suburban and wide roads in rural areas, which led to the construction of a middle-class family house
 is andolan main nimna madhyam varg va kamgir virgon ke alag thalag pade nagari graamon kaa anya ilaakon se judaav, arthath upnagareey va gramin ilaakon kaa nagareey vyavsaayik kendron se judaav ke liye lee corboojier ke niyojan main koi jagah nahin thi
 This was because according to planning, roads used to come from the top, bottom or side of the residential areas of the working class and lower middle class
 is tarah kii pariyojnaayen va ilaakon main sadak se nikalne kaa koi rasta nahin tha or sadakon tak inke pahunchne kaa bhi rasta nahin tha, jaise ki kabrini green grih pariyojna main log naukariyon paane or seva pradaan karne ke avasaron se cat gaye kyonki ye sab lee corbuziye ke yatayaat-ant-binduon tak simit the
 As jobs progressed to the suburban ends coming to the end of these roads, urban villagers found their communities cut off from these major roads; Nor did they have public transport facilities so that they could economically do jobs in suburban centers

 The question mark has arisen over the views of Le Corbusier due to increasing traffic expenses and interest in middle and upper class people towards suburban and rural lifestyle
 ab nagareey ilaake zyaada vaanchit hai
 People are preferring to stay in condominiums in the city in many places
 kai kendriya vyavsaayik kendron main ab rihaishi ilaake bhi ban gaye hai yaa ban rahe hai
 Le Corbusier deliberately created myths about himself and during his lifetime he was highly respected, and after his death, his devotees made him an angel who could do nothing wrong
 lekin 1950 ke dashak main pehali shankaaye uthni shuru huin, khaas taur par unke apane hi shishyon dwaara nibandhon main, jaise ki james stirling va colin ro dwaara, jinhone unke nagar sambandhi vichaaron ko khatarnaak bataaya

 He has also written about the construction method and many inane solutions
