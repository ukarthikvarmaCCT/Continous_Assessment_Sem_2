 Mead was an advocate of expanding sexuality ethos within the boundaries of traditional religious life in the West

 This trend of anthropology is also known by the paralysis of 'culture and personality'

 In her compositions, she repeatedly emphasizes the pluralistic character of culture by resorting to the theory of cultural relativism propounded by her mentor, Franz Boas

 His father was a professor of finance and mother sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania
 1924 main snatakottar pariksha paas karne ke baad mid ne columbia vishvavidhyalay main frans boas or ruth benedict ke saath adhyayan karnaa shuru kiya
 The next year she went to fieldwork in Polynesia and then played the curator of anthropology at the New York City-based American Museum of Natural History

 He concluded that during his journey from childhood to adulthood, Samoa adolescents did not go through the kind of emotional turmoil that American adolescents typically face
 1928 main jab pehali baar yah pustak prakashit hui to kai pashchimi prekshkon ko iske kaaran acchhee kaasi saanskrithik thes lagi
 Mead had shown in his study that incestuous adultery is commonly taken for granted in Samoan society
 vahaan kii striyaan jab-tab yon kriya kaa anand leti hui apni shaadi ko taalati rahati hai
 But in the end, after getting married, she settles home and raise children

 The qualities that each society sees by associating with femininity or masculinity are found in both its members
 ve alag-alag kisi ek ling ke sadsy main samaan rup se nahin milte
 Mead explained from the illustrations of three communities within a radius of a hundred miles that earlier the pattern of conduct of men and women in both communities was in line with the expectations of modern society
 tisare samudaay main purush sajadhaj kar kareed- farokht karne jate hai or striyaan urjavan, prabandhkeey or kaamkaaji hoti hai
 Mead showed that the community of settlers in the Shambri Lake area of papua New Guinea recognized women's dominance
 sambhavtah purush is samaaj par apana prabhutv isliye sthapit nahin kar paye the ki australiayan prashasan ne yuddh ko pratibandhit kar diya tha
 Mead's research has revealed that women and men have a lot of peace in the Arpesh community
 ve yuddh karne ke prati aruchi rakhte hai
 On the other hand he underlined its opposite tendencies in the Mundugumore community

 is project main un samskritiyon kaa adhyayan bhi shaamil tha jinamein fildwork karnaa vyaavhaarik rup se sambhav nahin tha
 On the basis of 'distant studies' from Jewish communities in Japan, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Mead concluded that viewing the people of Russia as a threat to themselves in the post-colonial era is a reflection of the senselessness of Americans
 mid ke agrahon ke kaaran hi america yahudiyon kii cameti ne europe ke yahudee gaanvon ke adhyayan kii pariyojna chalaai
 Teams of researchers extensively interviewed migrant Jews living in New York

 Other anthropologists have accused Mead of having a tendency to deviate from scientific facts and analysis in the pursuit of incorporating popularity into his studies
 1983 main newzealand ke maanavshastri derek friman ne ‘margaret mid and samoa : da mekking and anameking of ain anthropolajical myth’ ke madhyam se mid ke pramukh nishkarshon kii pramanikta ko chunauti di
 He quoted the remaining informant women of that research, claiming that Mead had lured him to get his mind-boggling answers

 Pakistan Day or Republic Day is a national day celebrated in Pakistan

 This day is considered to be a very important day in Pakistani history in Pakistan, as it was offered in the Lahore session of the All India Muslim League (also called Lahore Proposal) in 1940, which lasted from 22 to 24 March
 It was on the basis of which the Muslim League started the movement for the acquisition of a separate country for the Muslims of India

 Although the name Pakistan had already been proposed by Chaudhary Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, by 1933, Majloom Haq Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other Muslim leaders were firm on the principle of Hindu Muslim unity, but the partition encouragement misconceptions constantly being promoted by the British
 Hindus had aroused a sense of mistrust and hatred towards Muslims

 The date and origin of a disputed instrument as a musical instrument is believed to be 67,000 years old; The artefacts, which are generally considered to be early flutes, are around 37,000 years old

 However, contact between civilizations resulted in the spread and conversion of most instruments far from their place of origin

 Comparing and organizing instruments on the basis of their complexity is misleading, as developments in instruments have sometimes reduced complexity
 udhaaharan ke liye, praarambhik slit drum ke nirmaan main vishaal pedo kii kataai or unhen khokhla karnaa shaamil tha; baad main slit drum kaa nirmaan bans ke tane ko kholkar kiya jane laga, jo kaaphi aasaan tha
 Similarly, it is misleading to organize the development of instruments on the basis of workmanship, since all cultures develop at different levels and have different materials available
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek hi samay main maujuud do samskritiyaan, jinke gathan, samskruti or hastkala main bhinnata thi, unke dwaara banaae gaye vaadyayantra kii tulana karne kaa prayaas karne vaale maanavvigyaani yah nirdhaarit nahin kar sakate ki koun se vaadyayantra adhik "aadim" hai
 Sorting instruments based on geography is also partly unreliable, as one cannot determine when and how cultures approached each other and shared knowledge among themselves

 Since the data in any one research route can be incomplete, all three routes provide a better historical picture
 19veen shatabdi tak, likhit europea sangeet itihaas, in puranicke vivaranon ke saath shuru hota he ki vaadyayantron kaa avishkaar kaise kiya gaya
 Such descriptions include Jubal, a descendant of Cain and "the father of all who handle the harp and organ", Pan, the inventor and mercury of the panpipe, who created the first lier from the turtle's dry shell
 aadhunik itihaas ne aisi puranic kathaon ko maanavshastreey atakalon ke dwaara pratisthapit kiya he or kabhi-kabhi ise puratathvik sakshya dwaara pusht bhi kiya he
 Scholars believe that there is no definite "invention" of the instrument, since the definition of the term "instrument" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the future-inventor
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek homo habilis kaa apane sharir par tamaache lagaana, bina uske iraade kii parvaah kiye ek nirmaanadhin vaadyayantra ho saktaa he
 The instruments that are considered to be the first instruments beyond the human body are rattles, stampers and various types of drums
 These early instruments evolved due to the human's impulse to add sound to emotional movements, such as dance
 Eventually, some cultures added ritual programs to their instruments
 Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments, such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets
 Some of these labels have significantly different connotations than those used in modern times; Early flutes and trumpets were labeled as such for their original function and use, and not for any resemblance to modern instruments

 Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists have primarily characterized ceremonial instruments, historians have been able to distinguish between the six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: Concussion clubs, clappers, sistras, bells, cymbals, and Tingling
 Sistra is most clearly depicted in the great engravings of Amenhotep III, and is of particular interest in this because similar designs have been found in remote areas, such as among the Tbilisi, Georgia, and Yakui tribes native to the Americas
 The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments rather than any other instrument, as evidenced by their spread in Mesopotamia's sculptures, placards and seals

 Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the Rigveda or religious songs
 Various drums, trumpets, harps and flutes were used in these songs

 Some methods arise as a result of disagreements between experts about how instruments should be classified
 jabaki vargeekaran pranali kaa puraa surveykshan karnaa is lekh ke daayre se pare he, pramukh pranaaliyon kaa ek saransh nimna he
 An ancient system, which dates back to at least the 1st century BC
 Coming from, the instruments are divided into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by moving strings; Instruments where sound is produced by the vibrations of air segments; Percussion instruments made of wood or metal; And leather-faced percussion instruments or drums
 victor-charles Mahillon later, adopted a very similar system
 He was the patron of the musical collection at the Conservatoire in Brussels and divided the instruments into four groups for the 1888 catalog of collections; Stringed instruments, howling instruments, percussion instruments and drums
 erik won hornbostel or court sacks ne baad main pracheen paddati ko liya or 1914 main Zeitschrift für Ethnologie main vargeekaran ke liye ek vyapak nai yojana prakashit kii
 His method is widely used today and is often referred to as the Hornbostel – Sachs method
 mul sacks-hornbostel paddati ne vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya samoohon main vargeekrut kiya: Sachs later added a fifth class, electrophones, such as the thermines, which produce sounds electronically
 prayek varg ke bheetar kai up-samooh hai
 The system was criticized and revised in previous years, but it is widely used by organologists and ethnomusicologists only
 andre shafnar, Musée de l'homme ke sangrakshak, sacks-hornbostel pranali se asahmat the or unhone 1932 main apni khud kii pranali viksit kii
 Schaffner believed that the classification of an instrument should determine its anatomy rather than its method of playing
 unki paddati ne vaadyayantron ko do virgon main baanta: aise vaadya jinka sharir thos or kampan yukt he or aise vaadya jinamein compit hawa hoti he
 Western instruments, too, are often classified by their musical range when compared with other instruments of the same family
 in shabdaawaliyon ko gayan kii awaz ke vargeekaran ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he: Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello can be considered either a tenor or a bass, depending on how its music fits into the group and can be trombone alto, tenor
 , Or bass and French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on which range it is played on
 saanchaa:vocal and instrumental pitch ranges Many instruments have range, as part of their name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, alto flute, bass flute, alto recorder, bass guitar, etc
 atirikt visheshan, sopraano range se upar yaa baas se neeche ke vaadya kaa varnan karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye: sopraanino sexophone, kontrabas clerinet
 When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the range of instruments in comparison to other instruments in their family and not in the range of human voices or instruments of other families
 For example, a bass flute has a range from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays down an octave
 vaadya yantra kaa nirmaan ek vishesh vyavsaay he jiske liye varshon kaa prashikshan, abhyaas or kabhi-kabhi ek prashikshu banane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most manufacturers of instruments specialize in one style of instrumentation, for example, a luthear makes only stringed instruments
 kuch nirmaataa keval ek prakaar ke vaadya banaate hai jaise piano
 Regardless of how the sound is produced in the instrument, many instruments have a keyboard as the user interface
 kunjeepatal vaadyayantra, aise vaadyayantra hai jinhen jinhen ek sangeet kunjeepatal dwaara bajaayaa jaataa he
 Each key produces one or more sounds; In most keyboard instruments, there are additional means to fluctuate these sounds
 They can produce sound by moving or pumping air, by pushing or pulling the moving wires, by electronic means, or in some other way
 Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the Gloukenspiel, have a keyboard attached to them
 haalanki unamem koi chalyman hissaa nahin hota he or unhen vadak ke haathon main pakade gaye mallett se bajaayaa jaataa he, unamem kunjiyon kii samaan bhautik vyavastha hoti he or ve samaan tareeke se dhwani tarange utpann karte hai
 The physical properties of substances are often divided into two parts - ye padaarth ke ve gun hai jo is baat par nirbhar nahin karte nikaay kaa aakaar chhota he yaa bada
 For example, density is an inferential property because see the density of a piece of 1 gram of a substance or of a piece of 10 kg - both will be the same
 in gunon ko 'maatra-swatantra gundharm' bhi kehete hai
 Other examples: heat, refractive index, hardness padaarth ke vistartmak gun ve hai jo nikaay ke aakaar par nirbhar karte hai
 For example, mass is an extensional property because the smaller sample of the substance will have less mass and the larger sample will have more
 in gunon ko 'maatraatmak gundharm' bhi kehete hai
 Other examples: Volume dakshin madhyapradesh ke chhindwara shahar se lagbhag 75 kilometre duuri par sthit yah vishalkay ghati kadharaatal lagbhag 3000 feet neeche he

 or turki samrajya kii bhanti unke dand main koi aupchaarikta nahin barti jaati thi
 There used to be a person at a distance of a day's journey for the method of commanding the emperor to the satraps
 ek duusare ke paas, doosraa tisare ke paas, is prakaar kshatrapon tak sandesh pahunchaaya jaataa tha
 The emperors of Persia also had other means to obtain subjugation of satraps
 a commissioner was sent with the patronage of the army to provide or punish according to the atmosphere and necessity
 xenofan ke anusaar yah pratha samrajya ke aarambh se hi chali aa rahi thi or uske samay bhi prachlit thi
 The emperor himself used to visit every territory of the empire every year to supervise the work of the satraps
 yadi vah swayan nahin ja paata to apane kisi pratinidhi ko bhej detaa tha
 In the province of Kshatrapas, on making special efforts for the fertility of the land or the promotion of agriculture, some other provinces would be provided to them, but where this order was not obtained, the state was cut off and merged with other Kshatrapan provinces
 praanton main prashasan ke vidhaan kaa bhaar samrat par hota tha jo apane bhai, kisi kutumbi athwa damaad ko kshatrap niyukt karata tha
 In India, Nahapan kept his son-in-law Ushwadat a satrap
 samrat ke saath bahuda nikat sambandh ke kaaran kshatrapon ke jivan main samrat kii hi bhanti vilasita parilakshith hoti thi
 Even in the court of Kshatrapas, formalities were carried out like an emperor
 samrat kii bhanti hi kshatrapon kaa apana antpur hota tha
 Antapur used to have a sufficient number of cleaves
 rajkeey sena ke atirikt kshatrapon kii vyaktigat sena hua karti thi
 Like the emperors, their palaces also had gardens, pramadavan, etc
 samraaton kii hi bhanti ve bhi varsh ke katipay mahinnon main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par samay vyateet karne ke liye jate the
 The Kshatrapas thus had more state power automatically
 sainya tathaa anya shaktiyon ke adhishthata hone ke atirikt ek or bhi baat thi jiske kaaran kshatrap atyant shaktishaalee ho jate the or unke vidroh karne kii ashanka bani rahati thi
 Sometimes they revolted
 kabhi do yaa adhik kshatrap praanton kaa adhishthata ek hi kshatrap bana diya jaataa tha jise mahakshatrap kehete the
 They had more military power and state power which helped in their rebellion
 iskaa udhaaharan daranvush ke rajyakaal main hi praapt he
 The Aroclies, who were the satraps of both Fijia and Lydia, revolted during the reign of the later rulers, especially in minor Asia, as the revolt of satraps began to increase
 laghu kurush ke kaal se kshatrapon kii is pravriti main nirantar vruddhi hoti gai
 The Kshatrapas sometimes revolted openly and declared themselves independent rulers
 in vidrohi kshatrapon main se bahuton ne kai rajyavanshon kii sthapana kii or baad main bilkul swatantra ho gaye
 In spite of all this, the emperor was successful in obtaining his subjection
 iskaa pramukh kaaran kshatrapon main parsparik kalah or yuddh tha
 Apart from this, due to the excesses of women in the court and the atmosphere of adultery, there was a comfortable loosening in the personality of the satraps
 kshatrap apane ko praanton ke raksharth niyukt nahin samajhate the balki unpar apana aadhipaty samajhate the
 One reason for this was also that the system of astral administration was also partly genetic
 ve kshatrap praanton ke bhoomikar tathaa anya aayon kaa upbhog karte the
 At the time of Xenophon, a satrap of Egypt was also appointed by the people of that region and they used to make arrangements instead
 yahi vyavastha uski mrityu ke pashchaat uski vidhwaa ke liye bhi hoti rahi
 Such a system easily loosened the structure of the empire
 parvarti kaal main kshatrapon ko rajkeey sena ke sanchaalan kaa bhi adhikaar mil gaya tha, visheshkar tab jab vah rajkeey parivaar kaa athwa uskaa koi sambandhi hota tha
 The little man was the satrap of Egypt, Fyzia, and Lydia, but he was also the commander of the entire army in the war
 yahi sthiti farnbesus tathaa anya kshatrapon kii bhi he, kintu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kshatrap praanton main sainik shashan ho gaya tha
 In fact, the emperor used to appoint both soldiers and officers of the society himself
 magistriton kii niyukti bhi vah swayan karata tha
 The satrap could not interfere with the work of magistrates
 kshatrapeey prashasan kii vyavastha ko sikandar tathaa uske uttaradhikariyon ne bhi apanaaya tha, visheshkar silyuks ke samrajya main yaheen vyavastha thi
 The states of Shakas which were established in India also had a regional state system
 bhartiya kshatrapon ke teen pramukh vansh or ek rajvansh tha- The Kshatrapas of Kapisha, Pushpur and Abhisar are found from the records found there

 punjab ke kshatrap teen vanshon se sambandh rakhte hai - Kshatrapas of Mathura - The first of this dynasty was Rajuvul or Ranjuvul, who probably also ruled the first Sakal
 stencono ne us vansh kaa is prakaar anumaan kiya he: The name of Rajuvul is found in inscriptions and postures
 mora crup abhilekh main use mahakshatrap kaha gaya he
 But in the article on his postures, he has been called 'rajadhiraj'
 rajuvul kaa uttaradhikari shuds tha
 Even in the records, he has been called Mahakshatrap
 inke abhilekhon main diye gaye varshon ko kuch vidvan shaq or kuch vikram samvath main maanate hai
 The means of resolving these differences have not yet been found
 cono ke anusaar kharoshth rajuvul kaa shvasur tathaa palit ke anusaar, dauhitr tha
 On another currency, 'kshatrapas Prakhar Oshtas Artasputras' is found in the Kharoshthi script

 Through coming through Persia, he became familiar with and associated with the system of Kshatriya; Apart from these, the currency of two Kshatrapas named Hagan and Hagamash have also been obtained from Mathura
 jo rajuvul vansh ke pashchaat mathura ke shaasha anumaan kiye jate hai
 On some coins the combined names of both are also found, and on some only the Hagamash
 inke pashchaat mathura main do-teen kshatrap or hue jinke naam bhartiya hai
 Perhaps by this time, these foreigners had fully embraced Indianness
 ujjain ke kshatrap - ujjain ke kshatrapon ko 'pashchimi bharat ke kshatrap' ke naam se bhi pukaarte he
 These satrapes appear to be of two lineages
 pehla vansh bhumak or nahpaan kaa tha tathaa doosraa chashton kaa
 Bhupak's successor Nahapan is not only traced to his silver and copper beads but also from the records of his son-in-law Ushavadat
 nahpaan ne pashchimi bharat ke kuch bhaag par bhi rajya kiya tha
 He also conquered some part of the Satavahana kingdom
 iske vansh ko shaharaat kehete he
 Rudradaman i ended the Shehrat dynasty
 girnaar abhilekh main use khakhraat vasanivases karas kaha gaya he
 Among the Kshatrapas of the second dynasty, who ruled in Ujjain, the name of Yasmotik, the father of Kardamak dynasty, comes first
 chashton kaa putr jaydaaman kshatrap tha kintu sambhavat vah pita ke jeevankaal main hi mar gaya or ujjain par chashton tathaa rudradaaman ne sammilit rup se shashan kiya
 In the Junagadh inscription it is said that in connection with Mahakshatrap Rudradamon, he had earned the title of Mahakshatrap
 prathit hota he ki uske vansh kii rajyashri sambhavat gautamiputra satkarni ne chin lee thi or rudradaaman ko mahakshatrap kii oopaadhi punah un pradeshon ko jitkar kerani arjeet kerani padi
 The Junagadh inscription praises his victories and his personality
 rudradaaman pratham kaa uttaradhikari uskaa jyeshtha putr damaghasad hua
 After him, the son of Damaghasad, Jeevadaman and his brother Rudrasinh succeeded him first

 His son Vishwesen became his satrap from the time of Bhartradaman
 bhartrudaman tathaa vishwasingh kaa sambandh mahakshatrap rudradaaman dwitiya se kya tha
 This cannot be said with certainty

 The last two visions in the conspiracies are called "epistemology"

 He has a more intimate relationship with the Vedas than other philosophies
 ek prakaar se ye vaidic darshan kii vyakhyaayein hai
 Poorvimamsa, Mantrasamhita and the rituals of Brahmins are explained

 There are three stages in the history of both epistemologies

 Acharyas expanded the Vedanta tradition

 These sects of Vedanta are not philosophical like Sankhya etc
; The religious benches of all these sects are revered in various places of the country

 All Vedic philosophies have acknowledged the importance of Karmayoga
 vyaavhaarik hone ke kaaran use pratinidhi bhartiya jeevandarshan kaha ja saktaa he
 Spirituality and life have been wonderfully coordinated in the Karmayoga of Gita
 aitihaasik drushti se yah vaidic karmkand or upanishdon ke brahmavaad kaa samanvay he
