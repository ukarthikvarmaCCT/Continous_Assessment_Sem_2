 dableroti yaa bread bhaad main pakaai hui khamir lage maide kii roti hoti he
 It is thick and tickling
 aajkal vishwa ke lagbhag saare deshon main dableroti kaa upyog ho rahaa he
 But the favorite breadth of modern people has existed since centuries, not today
 kehete hai ki isa se 3000 varsh purv misr main dabl roti kii shuruuaat hui thi
 The people there used to cook yeast cake made with dough in a kiln and make bread
 is prakaar dableroti banane ke namoonay misr ke makbaron main milte hai
 In different countries, bread is made from different substances
 kahin namak mili aate yaa maida se, to kahin aalu, matar, chaaval yaa jau kaa aataa milakar ise bahut swaadisht banane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 The yeast mixed in bread flour makes gas when cooked, which bursts out as a bubble
 isi kaaran dableroti main suraakh hote hai
 Adi used to soak grains of wheat, grind them on stone
 phir us lugdi ko angaaron yaa garam pathar par senk liya karata tha
 Along with the development of civilization, roti also changed its shape and today pulp roti has replaced yeast double bread
 dableroti banane ke liye gehun kaa aataa banane kii prakriya bhi bady manoranjak he
 Wheat is stored in big cells and about two and a half tons of wheat is pulled up in a minute with powerful pumps
 yah jamaa kiya hua gehun bhi jyon kaa tyon kaam main nahin liya jaataa balki badi aataa mil main ek towernuma dhaanche main lagi anek moti or maheen chalaniyon se gujarata he
 Wheat pebbles and straws are cleared by this process
 ab gehun dhulaai kaksh se gujarata hua garam hawa main sookhne ke liye kuch der rukta he
 When dried, it is thickly puffed with cylinders of the prescribed size
 iske baad baarik belanon se isaki pisai hoti he
 That fine flour also has to go through five-six-thick, fine-grained sieves
 in chalaniyon main taqatvar chumbak lage rahete hai, taaki aate main paddy lohe kii ashudhdiyon ko khinch saken
 Now this refined flour becomes maida and comes to the market
 bas, isi maide se banati hai - dabl rotiyaan
 First, maida is added by the machine in a large vessel
 usamen saaf pani or nirdhaarit maatra main chini evam khamir yukt ghol milakar goondha jaataa he
 After kneading the dough is placed on a long table with a metal surface and covered with a fine cloth
 is bich khamir ke kaaran aate main khattapan aa jaataa he or uskaa jaayaka bhi kuch alag ho jaataa he
 Together, carbon dioxide gas is formed, which makes the entire dough inflated and lightens like a sponge
 jab bhatthi main dabl roti sinkati he to taap ke kaaran gas roti ko chalni karti hui ud jaati he
 This feature is only in wheat flour
 ab yah gundha hua maida yantron se kaante par tulata he or nirdhaarit maap kii loiyon main bant jaataa he
 These pieces are made by machine in the shape of bread
 neeche dhaatu kaa ek paatr rahata he, jisamen se dabl roti girti jaati he
 These vessels are stored in a furnace with temperatures ranging from 450 ° f to 500 ° F
 lagbhag 40-50 minute baad dableroti taiyaar ho jaati he
 This preparation requires a lot of care to cut the bread
 agar zyada garam avasthaa main ise pack kar diya jaae to thandi padane par iske sil jane kii ashanka rahati he or fafoond uth sakati he
 Therefore, it is usually packed at a temperature of 90 ° f to 95 ° F

 On this day, the serpent god or snake is worshiped and they are given a bath with milk
 lekin kahin-kahin doodh pilaane kii parampara chal padi he
 Feeding the snake leads to death due to lack of digestion or allergy
 shastron main naagon ko doodh pilaane ko nahin balki doodh se snaan karaane ko kaha gaya he
 On the same day of Nagpanchami, wrestling takes place in many villages and towns in which wrestlers from around the world participate
 gaay, bail aadi pashuon ko is din nadi, talab main le jaakar nahalaaya jaataa he
 Ashtanagas are worshiped on this day
 - Hindu culture has tried to make intimate connections with all animals, birds and plants
 hamaare yahaan gaay kii puja hoti he
 Many sisters observe nightingale

 The bull is worshiped here on the day of Vrishabhotsav

 We try to cultivate intimacy with them by worshiping cows, bulls, cuckoos, etc
, because they are useful
 lekin naag hamaare kis upyog main aata he, ulte yadi kaate to jaan liye bina na rahe
 We are all afraid of him
 naag ke is dar se nagpuja shuru hui hogi, aisa kai log maanate hai, parantu yah manyata hamaari samskruti se susangat nahin lagati
 We get to see the enormity of the heart of the Aryans in accepting Nag as a god
 'krinvanto vishwamaryam' is garjana ke saath aage badhate hue aaryon ko bhinn-bhinn upasna karte hue anek samoohon ke sampark main aana padaa
 The Aryans had to work very hard to get effective ideas of the Vedas to them
 vibhinn samoohon ko upasna vidhi main rahe fark ke kaaran hone vaale vivaad ko yadi nikaal diya jaae to maanav maatr vedon ke tejasvi or bhavy vichaaron ko sweekaar karegaa, is par aaryon kii akhand shraddha thi
 To make it successful, the Aryans accepted the worship of different gods moving in different arms and they assimilated different elements into their own
 in vibhinn pujaaon ko sweekaar karne ke kaaran hi hamen nagpuja praapt hui hogi, aisa lagata he
 India was and is a farming country
 saanp kheton kaa rakshan karata he, isliye use kshetrapal kehete hai
 The snake keeps our fields green by destroying the animals, rats, etc
 which are the elements that cause crop damage
 saanp hamen kai mook sandesh bhi detaa he
 We should have qualitative and astounding vision to see the qualities of a snake
 bhagwaan dattatraya kii aisi shubh drushti thi, isliye hi unhen prayek vastu se kuch na kuch sikh mili
 Snakes generally do not bite anyone without reason
 use pareshaan karne vaale ko yaa chhedane waalon ko hi vah dansataa he
 The snake is also the surgeon of the Lord, if he goes smoothly without doing harm, or he lives as a non-innocent, then we have no right to kill him
 jab ham uske praan lene kaa praytn karte hai, tab apane praan bachaane ke liye yaa apana jivan tikaane ke liye yadi vah hamen dans de to use dusht kaise kaha ja saktaa he? hamaare praan lene waalon ke praan lene kaa praytn kya ham nahin karte? The snake is very pleasing to the aroma
 champa ke paudhe ko lipatakar vah rahata he yaa to chandan ke vriksh par vah nivas karata he
 He also wanders in the forest of Kevda
 use sugandh priy lagati he, isliye bhartiya samskruti ko vah priy he
 Every human will get the aroma of virtues in life, the feeling of good thoughts, that fragrance should be dear to us
 ham jaanate hai ki saanp bina kaaran kisi ko nahin katata
 He does not want to lose wasted time by just biting someone by accumulating hard work over the years
 ham bhi jivan main kuch tap karenge to usase hamen bhi shakti paidaa hogi
 It is expected that this power should be spent in anger on someone, not in vain to surprise the weak, or in grieving the infirm, in developing our power, in enabling other incapable, in strengthening the weak
 kuch daivi saanpon ke mastishk par mani hoti he
 The gem is priceless
 hamen bhi jivan main amuly vastuon ko mastishk par chadhaanaa chahie
 Great people like Mukutmani of society should be on our mind
 hamen prem se unki palki uthaani chahie or unke vichaaron ke anusaar hamaare jivan kaa nirmaan karne kaa ahernish praytn karnaa chahie
 The spiritual science which is manifested in all disciplines, must have a unique attraction in our life
 aatmavikas main sahaayak na ho, us gyaan ko gyaan kaise kaha ja saktaa he? The snake lives on the bill and consumes solitude mostly
 isliye mumukshu ko jansamooh ko taalna chahie
 An example of a snake is given in this regard
 dev-daanvon dwaara kiye gaye samudr manthan main saadhan rup banakar vasuki naag ne durjanon ke liye bhi prabhu kaary main nimitt banane kaa maarg khulaa kar diya he
 If an evil person also comes on the right path then he can give his great sum in the cultural work and if the weakness continues continuously, such a person will not be too proud for his hospitality
 durjan bhi yadi bhagavad kaary main jud jaae to prabhu bhi usko sweekaar karte hai, is baat kaa samarthan shiv ne saanp ko apane gale main rakhkar or vishnu ne shesh-shayan karke kiya he
 It is our duty to worship him with a thankful intellect, when a snake, who has been exiled due to rains for the benefit of the entire creation, comes to our house as a guest
 is tarah naag panchami kaa utsav shravan maheene main hi rakhkar hamaare rishiyon ne bahut hi auchity dikhaaya he
 The whole Shravan month, especially Nagpanchami, is prohibited from digging the earth
 is din vrath karke sanpon ko kheer khilaai va doodh pilaayaa jaataa he
 Nag Panchami is also celebrated on the fifth day of the Krishna Paksha of Sawan month
 is din safed camel puja main rakhaa jaataa he
 In ancient times one Sethji had seven sons
 saaton ke vivaah ho chuke the
 The wife of the youngest son was sagely and gentle, but he had no brother
 ek din badi bahu ne ghar lipane ko pili mitti laane ke liye sabhi bahuon ko saath chalane ko kaha to sabhi daliya or khurpy lekar mitti khodne lagi
 Then a snake came out there, which the elder daughter-in-law started to kill with the hoof
 yah dekhakar choti bahu ne use rokte hue kaha- 'mat maaro ise? yah bechaara nirparaadh he
 ' yah sunakar badi bahu ne use nahin maaraa tab sarp ek ore ja baitha
 Then the younger daughter-in-law said to her - "we just come back and don't leave here
" yah kahkar vah sabake saath mitti lekar ghar chali gai or vahaan kaamkaaj main fasakar sarp se jo vaada kiya tha use bhul gai
 When she remembered the other day, she reached there with everyone and seeing the snake sitting at that place, said - Hello snake brother! The snake said- 'you have said brother, therefore i leave you, otherwise i would have bothered you because of telling a lie
 vah boli- bhaiya mujhase bhul ho gai, uski kshamaa maangti hum, tab sarp bolaa- acha, tu aaj se meri bahin hui or main tera bhai hua
 Ask for what you want
 vah boli- bhaiya! meraa koi nahin he, acha hua jo tu meraa bhai ban gaya
 After some days, he came to his house keeping the form of a snake and said, 'send my sister
 ' sabane kaha ki 'iske to koi bhai nahin tha, to vah bolaa- main dur ke rishte main iskaa bhai hoon, bachapan main hi baahar chalaa gaya tha
 After convincing her, the people of the house sent Chhoti with her
 usne maarg main bataaya ki 'main vahiin sarp hoon, isliye tu darana nahin or jahaan chalane main kathinaayee ho vahaan meri puch pakad lenaa
 She did as she was told and thus reached her home
 vahaan ke dhan-aishwarya ko dekhakar vah chakit ho gai
 One day the serpent's mother said to him- 'I am going out of work, give cold milk to your brother
 use yah baat dhyaan na rahi or usase garm doodh pilaa diya, jisamen uskaa mukh betarah jal gaya
 Seeing this, the snake's mother was very angry
 parantu sarp ke samajhane par chup ho gai
 Then the serpent said that the sister should now be sent to her house
 tab sarp or uske pita ne use bahut sa sona, chaandi, jawaharaat, vastra-bhushan aadi dekar uske ghar pahunchaa diya
 Seeing so much wealth, the elder daughter-in-law said to Isha - Brother is very rich, you should bring more wealth from him
 sarp ne yah vachan suna to sab vastuen sone kii laakar de deen
 Seeing this, the elder daughter-in-law said- 'the broom to clean them should also be of gold'
 tab sarp ne jhaadoo bhi sone kii laakar rakh di
 The serpent gave the younger daughter-in-law a wonderful necklace of diamonds
 uski prashansa us desh kii rani ne bhi suni or vah raja se boli ki- seth kii choti bahu kaa haar yahan aana chahie
 'the king ordered the minister that he should be present soon with the necklace from him
 The minister went to Sethji and said' Maharaniji will wear the necklace of the younger daughter-in-law, she will give it to me ' sethji ne dar ke kaaran choti bahu se haar mangakar de diya
 The younger daughter-in-law found it very bad, she remembered her snake brother and prayed on coming - brother! The queen has snatched the necklace, you do something that when that necklace is around her neck, it becomes a snake for the time being and when she returns to me it becomes diamonds and beads
 sarp ne thik vaisaa hi kiya
 As soon as the queen wore the necklace, it became a snake
 yah dekhakar rani cheekh padi or rone lagi
 Seeing this, the king sent news to Seth to send the younger daughter-in-law immediately
 sethji dar gaye ki raja na jane kya karegaa? ve swayan choti bahu ko saath lekar upasthit hue
 The king asked the younger daughter-in-law what magic you have done, i will punish you
 choti bahu boli- rajan ! dhristataa kshamaa kiijie, yah haar hi aisa he ki mere gale main hiron or maniyon kaa rahata he or duusare ke gale main sarp ban jaataa he
 Hearing this, the king turned the snake and gave it to him and said - now show it while wearing it
 choti bahu ne jaise hi use pahana vaise hi hiron-maniyon kaa ho gaya
 Seeing this, the king was convinced of his words and pleased him and gave him many currencies as well
 choti vah apane haar or in sahit ghar laut ai
 Seeing her wealth, the elder daughter-in-law taught her husband that the younger daughter-in-law came from somewhere because of jealousy
 yah sunakar uske pati ne apni patni ko bulaakar kaha- thik-thik bataa ki yah dhan tuje koun detaa he? tab vah sarp ko yaad karne lagi
 At that time, the snake appeared and said - If my religion doubts the conduct of the sister, i will eat it
 yah sunakar choti bahu kaa pati bahut prasann hua or usne sarp devtaa kaa bada satkar kiya
 From the same day, the festival of Nagpanchami is celebrated and women worship the serpent as their brother
 aantvaan laurent lavvazye, france kaa suprasiddh rasayanajna tha
 It was the center of the eighteenth century chemical revolution
 rasayan or jeevigyaan donon ke itihaas par uskaa bahut adhik prabhaav padaa
 Most people consider him the father of modern chemistry
 usne sarvapratham siddh kiya ki vaayu ke mukhya ghatak nitrogen evam oxigen hai
 Lavasiye was born in a wealthy business family in Paris, having studied law, mathematics, astronomy and botany and chemistry in college
 rasayan shaastra main atyadhik aakarshan ke kaaran aapane kanoon kaa dhandha chhodkar, apane jivan kaa uddeshy vaigyanik anusandhan banaaya tathaa san 1765 main france kii vaigyanik parishad main apana pratham lekh upasthit kiya
 From this council, in 1766, by writing an article on the best way to publish the streets of a large city, he received a gold medal
 iske pashchaat do varsh tak ye france ke bhoumikeey surveykshan main lage rahe or san 1768 main france desh kaa pratham bhuvaigyanik maanchitr taiyaar kiya
 In the same year, he was nominated as a cooperative member of the Scientific Council
 lavvazye ko aadhunik rasayan kaa janmdata mana jaataa he
 In the field of chemistry, he has the same place as Newton in the field of physics
 do hajaar varsh se yah vishwaas chalaa aata tha ki jal ko prithvi main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1770, Lvavzje described his experiments and their fruits, which proved this belief to be false
 paanch varshon tak lagaataar vividh prayog kar inhone khoj nikaala ki vaayu do gaison kaa mishran he
 One of these is named 'oxygen'
 aapane dikhaaya ki vastuon ke jalane ke liye oxigen kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tathaa saans lene main bhi yahi gas kaam aati he
 Thus you have proved that combustion and respiration are mainly the same type of processes and metals are formed by the combination of metals with oxygen of air
 san 1783 main aapane ghoshnaa kii ki jal hydrogen or oxigen kaa yogic he
 Elements were considered to be the substances from which all other substances of the world are made, but they themselves are not formed from any other substance
 is prakaar yah paramparaagat dharna ki jal ek tatv he, tut gai
 Lavaszew first prepared a list of chemical elements
 aapane anya vaigyanikon ke sahyog se padaarthon ke rasinic naam rakhane kii ek paddati bhi taiyaar kii, jiskaa upyog abhi bhi hota he
 Lavaczeye compiled the knowledge derived from experiments conducted by himself and other alchemists, such as Black, Priestley, Cavendish, etc
, to design a new Rasayanastra, which took the form of modern chemistry
 aapane rasayan aadi vishyon par kai utkrisht granth likhe hai
 Lavazze also did important works in Paris' public life
 raajnneeti main inke vichaar udaar the
 In France at that time, he accepted social reform as necessary, but was not in favor of adopting illegal measures for the purpose
 sarkaar ko sahaayta pahunchaane ke uddeshy se aspataal, jail aadi se sambandhit anek prashnon par aapane vistrut jaanchen kii

 kaab aakhirkaar us antarim duniya main umradraj ho chuke saito ko paakar, uske ekararnaame kii yaad dilaataa he
 The two then wake up in the same plane where the rest of the team and Robert Fischer had already woken up

 isp kaa ullekh kai pracheen unani granthon main bhi miltaa he- aristophans ne apni hasya naatika da wasps main nayak philocleon ko bhoj samarohon main hone vaale vaartalapon se isap kaa betukapan siikhe hue hona chitrit kiya tha; plato ne feedo main likhaa tha ki sucraat ne isap kii kuch dantakthaon ko, “jo unhen yaad thim”, padya main parivartit karke apana jail kaa samay kaata tha
 However, for two main reasons - because many teachings related to Aesop's legends are contradictory and because there is a contradiction in ancient details about Aesop's life, so the modern approach is that all the legends, whose Credit is given to him, possibly not by Aesop if he ever really existed
 aadhunik adhyayan se yah pataa chalata he ki “ispi” rup kii dantakathaayen or kahavatein sabase pehle teesri shatabdi isapurv sumer or akad donon ke samay main maujuud thim

 Therefore, there is some dispute on whether the Greeks learned these legends from the Indian narratives or were they overturned or it was a mutual effect

 arestu ke is anuyaayi ne, purv ke unani lekhakon dwaara alag-alag uddharanon ke rup main upyog kii gai sabhi dantakthaon ko gadhy main rakhte hue maatr unhen soochibaddh kiya tha
 At least this was a proof that was credited by others to Aesop; But it could accuse them of including any proverb or joke that these authors transmitted to them through oral tradition through animal fables, fictional short stories, work-cause theories or satirical myths
 yah isap ke vaastavik lekhakatv kii bajaay uske naam kii shakti kaa saboot adhik he, jisane aisi kahaniyon ko apni ore khinchaa
