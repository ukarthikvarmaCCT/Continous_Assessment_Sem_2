 The detailed mechanism by which polar ozone holes differ from mid-latitude depletion, but the most important process in both trends is the decomposition of ozone by atomic chlorine and bromine
 The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is the light decomposition of chloro-fluoro-carbon compounds, these compounds are commonly called phreon, as well as the light decomposition of bromo-fluoro-carbon compounds called halons

 Ozone degradation occurs due to ultraviolet rays
 oxigen ke teenon apper rup ozon-oxigen chakra main shaamil hai:oxigen parmaanu, oxigen gas or ozon gas 
 Ozone is formed in the stratosphere when oxygen molecules decompose by absorbing an ultraviolet photon of wavelength smaller than 240 nm

 Bundelkhand is a state of subcastes of Vindhyachal
 is giri kii anek unchi nichi shakhaain - prashakhaain hai
 In its south, there are fallen ridges like Mekal, Camor in the east, Kenjua in the northeast, Sarang and Panna in the middle and Bhimtore and Pir in the west

 Along with reservoir indicator names, the names of trees have become village names by combining them
 jaise simratal, amanro
 Many village names have also come from the names of animals such as Badha to Badhai or Badhai, Hiran to Hiranpuri
 vrikshon se naam sthaan par kai gaanvon ke naamak pashuon or jalaashyon ke naam ko bhi mila kar bane hai jaise - baghadbari, hathisra, gidhuta, magarmuha, jheenguri
 It is known from the introduction of the appropriate village-name-names that many strange names of villages have been kept, which sometimes seems funny

 ganit main, paaythagorian prameya yaa paaythagoras' prameya yuklidian jyamiti main ek samakon trikon ke teen parshvon ke bich ek rishta he
 This theorem is usually written as an equation: jahaan c karn kii lambaai ko pratinidhitiv karata he or a or b anya do parshvon kii lambaai ko pratinidhitiv karte hai
 in words: samakon trikon ke karn kaa varg anya do parshvon ke virgon kii raashi ke baraabar he
 The Pythagorean theorem is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who is customarily credited with his own discovery and proof, although it has often been argued that this theory dates back to him
 
 If we take the length of the hypotenuse c and the length of the other two sides a and b, then the theorem can be expressed as an equation: yaa, c ke liye hal: If c is already given and the length of a leg has to be established, the following equation can be used: yaa This equation provides a simple relationship between the three sides of a right triangle so that if either of the lengths of both sides is known, the length of the third side can be found out
 is prameya kaa saamanyakaran kosine kaa niyam he, jo kisi bhi trikon ke tisare parshv kii lambaai ke hisaab karne kii anumati detaa he, yadi do parshvon kii lambaai or unke bich ke kone kaa aakaar diya jaae
yadi donon parshvon ke bich kaa kone samakon he to vah paaythagorian prameya kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 This is a theorem of which more proofs than others can be known; The book Pythagorean Proposal, by Elisha Scott Loomis, contains 367 proofs
 trigonometric pahchaan ke aadhaar par kuch tark ne is prameya ko saboot ke rup main prastaavit kiya gaya he
 However, since all fundamental trigonometric identities have been proved using the Pythagorean theorem, there can be no trigonometric evidence
 paaythagorian prameya ke adhikansh sabooton kii tarah, yah do samaan trikon ke parshvon kii samanta par aadhaarit he
 ABC is considered to be a right triangle, in which the right angle is located at C, as shown in the figure
 ham c bindu se oonchai banaate hai or AB parshv ke saath uske pratichhedan ko h bulaate hai
 This new triangle ACH is similar to our triangle ABC, because they both have right angles and they are part of the a angle, which means that the third angle is also the same in both triangles
 ek samaan tark se, trikon CBH bhi ABC ke samaan he
 This similarity leads to two ratios
 
: like tathaa They can also be written as in do samaantaaon kaa sankshep karke, hamen praapt hota he In other words, the Pythagorean theorem: euclid ke tatwon main, pustak 1 kaa prastaav 47, paaythagorian prameya nimnlikhit linon ke saath ek tark se sabit hota he
 A, B, c are considered the vertices of the right triangle, in which the right angle will be on A
 Drop a perpendicular from a to Karna opposite the square at the hypotenuse
 The line divides the square at the hypotenuse into two imports, each having the same area as one of the two legs being square
 aupchaarik pramaan ke liye, hamen chaar praathmik lemmata kii aavashyaktaa he: The instinctive idea behind this proof, which can make it easier to follow, is that the two squares above have been transformed into a parallelogram of the same size, then bended and the left and right rectangles have been changed to the lower squares, then continuous
 In area
 saboot nimnanusaar he: This proof appears in Euclid's Elements as Proposition 1
47
 james e
 garfield ko ek upanyaas bijiy saboot dwaara shrey diya gaya he: The entire trapezium is half of the left square, so its area = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 trikon 1 or trikon 2 prayek kshetrafal ab / 2 he
 The area of triangle 3 is c2 / 2 and it is half of the square on the hypotenuse
 lekin trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal bhi = - Hence the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 is saboot main, karn par varg plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan ko anya do parshvon main virgon ke rup main jod sakate hai plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan
yah saboot china se darj kii gai he
 From Euclid's proof diagram above, we can see three identical figures, each with a "triangle over a square"
 kyunki bada trikon do chote trikon se bana he, uskaa kshetrafal in do chote kaa jod he
 By analogy, the three squares are in the same ratio with each other as the three triangles and the area of the larger square is the sum of the area of the two smaller squares
 viparyay se saboot ko chithran or anemeshan ke dwaara diya gaya he
 In this example, the area of each large square is 2
 donon main, charon samaan trikon kaa kshetrafal hataa diya gaya he
 The remaining areas, a2 + b2 and c 2, are equal
 Q
E
D This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not preliminary, in the sense that it does not depend only on the most basic theory and theorems of Euclidean geometry
 vishesh rup se, jab trikon or virgon ke kshetrafal kaa sutara dena bahut aasaan he, yah sabit karne ke liye aasaan nahin he ki ek varg kaa kshetrafal uske tukdon ke kshetron kaa jod he
 In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem
 In fact, this difficulty affects all simple field-involved Euclidean proofs; For example, to get the area of a right-angled triangle involves an assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle of the same height and plane
 isi kaaran se, jyamiti ke liye swayansiddh parichay aam taur par trikon kii samanta ke aadhaar par ek or saboot kaa prayog karata he 
 In the third graphic illustration of this Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse fits the square of the sides
 ek sambandhit saboot yah dikhaa saktaa he kii punah sthapit bhaag mul ke samaan hai or, kyunki samaan kaa jod samaan he, kii unke kshetra bhi samaan hai
 To show that a square is the result, we have to show the length of the new sides equal to c
 Note that for this proof to work, we need to handle the way to cut a smaller square into more parts
 As the sides become smaller and smaller

 Looking at the illustration which is a large square with equal right-angled triangles at the corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle with C
 in trikon ke a -parshv kone or b -parshv kone anupoorak kone hai, nile kshetra ke prayek kone samakon hai, is kshetra ko ek varg banaate hue jiske parshv kii lambaai c he
 The area of this square is C2
 In this way the area of the whole is given: haalanki, bade varg ke parshvon kii lambaai a + B, ham uske kshetrafal kii gananaa kar sakate hai jaise 2, jo A2 + 2AB + B2 main vistaarit hota he
 The Pythagorean theorem can be arrived at by studying the following diagram of how a lateral change can produce a change in the hypotenuse and using a small algorithm
 parshv a ke da main parivartan ke parinaam swarup, For a change in the similarity and difference of a triangle
 char ke viyojan par
 The result is the addition of a second term to the change in side b
 samekit detaa he When a = 0 then c = b, then b 2 is "continuous"
 isliye As can be seen, this square is due to the special ratio between the changes and the sides, whereas the independent contribution of changes to the sides is the result of an amount that is not clear from geometric proofs
 is die gaye anupaat se yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he kii parshvon main parivartan parshvon se pratipanupati anupaat hai
 This differential equation suggests that this theorem is due to the related transform and its derivation is almost identical to the line integral computation
 yah maatra da or dc kramshah a or c main atyant chote parivartan hai
 But we use the real numbers Δa and Δc instead, then the ratio of their ratio is da / dc when their size is zero proximity, derivative and c / a are also close, the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangle and the result of the differential equation
 It shows
 is prameya kaa viparyaay bhi sach he: For any three positive numbers a, b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle whose sides are a, b and c and every triangle has a right angle between the sides whose lengths are a and b
 yah viparyaay euclid ke tatwon main maujuud hota he
 This can be proved by using the cosine method, or by the following proof: ABC ko ek trikon maanate hai jiske parshvon kii lambaai a, b or c he, a2 + b2 = c2 ke saath
hamen yah sabit karnaa he ki a or b parshvon ke bich ke kone samakon he
 We construct another triangle in which there is a right angle between the sides whose length is a and b
 paaythagorian prameya se, nimnanusaar he ki is trikon ke karn lambaai bhi c he
 Since the sides of the two triangles have the same length, a, b and c, they are congruent and therefore must have the same angle
 Therefore, the sides that have length a and b in our original triangle have a right angle between them
 paaythagorian prameya ke viparyaay kaa ek anumaan he kii nirdhaaran karne kaa ek saral tarika he kii yadi ek trikon samakon, obtyus, yaa acute he, is prakaar se
jahaan c ko teenon parshvon main lanbaa chunaa gaya he: a Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b and c, such as a2 + b2 = c2
 In other words, a Pythagorean triple describes the length of the sides of a right angle where the integer length of all three sides is

 Such triples are commonly written
 Some famous examples are and ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , One of the results of the Pythagorean theorem is that the unstructured length, such as the square root of 2, can be constructed

 The theory of Euclidean geometry derives from the Pythagorean theorem, in fact, the Euclidean type of the Pythagorean theorem stated above does not occur without Euclidean geometry

 ) For example, in spherical geometry, the length of the three sides of a right-angled triangle of unit area limited by octet is equal to π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2}; Euclidean violates the Pythagorean theorem because π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} iskaa matlab he kii bina yucalidian prameya main, paaythagorian prameya ko yucalidian prameya se ek alag rup lenaa chahie

 Using the mclaurin series for this cosine function, it can be shown that the radius r reaches infinity, as it is, the spherical form of the Pythagorean theorem approaches the Euclidean form

 The Pythagoras formula is used to find the distance between two digits in a Cartesian coordinate plane and is valid if all the coordinates are real: digits {2 + 2)
 But with complex coordinates: examples, digits {and {i The distance between, 0} will remain zero, which results in redactio ad Absurdum
 This is because this formula relies on the theorem of Pythagoras, which relies on the area in its Hass proof Land and area that is dependent on triangles and other geometrical figures from outside the inside, which is not possible if the coordinates are complex

 inhone phir presidency mahavidhyalay main bhautikee ke praadhyaapak kaa pad sambhala or jatigat bhedbhaav kaa saamana karte hue bhi bahut se mahatvapurn vaigyanik prayog kiye
 He made extraordinary progress in sending wireless signals and first started using semiconductors to capture radio messages
 lekin apni khojon se vyavsaayik laabh uthaane kii jagah inhone inhen saarvajanik rup se prakashit kar diya taaki anya shodhakartta inpar aage kaam kar saken
 After this, he made many discoveries in botany
 inhone ek yantra crescograph kaa avishkaar kiya or isse vibhinn uttejkon ke prati paudhon kii pratikriya kaa adhyayan kiya
 In this way, they proved that there is a lot of similarity between flora and animal tissues
 ye patent prakriya ke bahut viruddh the or mitron ke kehane par hi inhone ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 In recent years, their contributions to modern science are again being recognized
 basu kaa janm 30 navambar 1858 ko bengal main dhaka jile ke faridpur ke memansingh main hua tha

 jagadish chandra bose kii jeev vigyaan main bahut ruchi thi or 22 varsh kii aayu main chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai karne ke liye landan chale gaye
 But due to poor health, he gave up the idea of becoming a doctor and went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and there, a famous professor of physics, Father Lafont, inspired Bose to study physics
 varsh 1885 main ye swadesh laute tathaa bhautikee ke sahaayak praadhyaapak ke rup main presidency college main padhaane lage
 Here he stayed until 1915
 us samay bhartiya shikshakon ko angrej shikshakon kii tulana main ek tihaai vetan diya jaataa tha
 This was opposed by Jagdish Chandra Bose and continued to work for three years without pay, due to which his condition deteriorated and he was severely indebted
 is karj ko chukaane ke liye unhen apni pushtaini jameen bhi bechni padi
 Jagdish Chandra Bose won the fourth year and was given full salary
 bose ek achche shikshak bhi the, jo kaksha main padhaane ke liye bade paimaane par vaigyanik pradarshnon kaa upyog karte the
 Some students of Bose like Satendra Nath Bose later became famous physicists

 British physicist Oliver Lodge demonstrated the existence of Maxwell waves by transmitting them with stars in 1887–88
 german bhautikashastri henrik hertz ne 1888 main mukt antariksh main vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv ko prayog karke dikhaaya
 Subsequently, Lodge continued Hertz's work and gave a memorable lecture in June 1894 and published it in book form
 loj ke kaam ne bharat ke bose sahit vibhinn deshon ke vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 The first notable aspect of Bose's microwave research was that he brought the wavelength to the millimeter level
 ve prakaash ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye lambii tarang dairdhya kii prakaash tarangon ke nuksaan ko samaj gaye
 In 1893, Nikola Tesla performed the first public radio communications
 ek saal baad, kolkata main navambar 1894 ke ek saarvajanik pradarshan dauraan, bose ne ek millimetre range microwave tarang kaa upyog barood duuri par prajvalit karne or ghanti bajaane main kiya
 Lieutenant Governor Sir William mckenzie witnessed Bose's performance at the Calcutta Town Hall
 bose ne ek bengali niabandh, 'adrishy alok' main likhaa tha, "adrishy prakaash aasaani se eent kii deevaaron, bhawanon aadi ke bheetar se ja sakati he, isliye taar kii bina prakaash ke madhyam se sandesh sanchaarit ho saktaa he
 "popov did one such experiment in Russia

 His second article was sent to Lord Royal in London in October 1895 by Lord Rayleigh
 disambar 1895 main, landan patrika electrician ne bose kaa lekh "ek nae electro-polariscope par" prakashit kiya
 At that time the term 'coherer' coined by Lodge in the English-speaking world was used for Hertz's wave receiver or detector
 electrician ne tatkaal bose ke 'kohirar' par tippanee kii
 
 The commentary quoted from the English magazine Electrician is: bose "apane kohirar" ko behtar karne kii yojana banaai lekin yah patent ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 Bose conducted his experiments at a time when radio was developing as a contact medium
 radio microwave optics par bose ne jo kaam kiya tha wo radio communication se judaa hua nahin tha, lekin unke dwaara kiye hue sudhaar evam unke dwaara is vishay main likhe hue tathyon ne duusare radio avishkaarakon ko zarur prabhavit kiya tha
 In the late 1894 era, Guglielmo Marconi was working on a radio system that was being designed specifically for wireless telegraphy
 1896 ke aarambh tak yah pranali physics dwaara bataaye gaye range se zyaada duri main radio signlles transmit kar rahi thi
 Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first scientist to find out what the semiconductor junction was used to detect radio waves and discovered many microwave components in this method
 iske baad agle 50 saal tak millimetre lambaai kii electromagnetic tarango par koi shodh kaary nahin hua tha
 In 1897, Bose described his research on millimeter waves at the Royal Institution in London
 unhone apane shodh main vevagids, horn antena, daai -electric lens ,alag alag posraiser or semiconductor jinaki frequency 60 ghz tak thi -- unka istemaal kiya tha
 All these devices are still present at Bose Institute, Kolkata
 ek 1
3 mm multibeam resiver jo kii erizona ke NRAO 12 meter telescope main hai, acharya bose 1897 main likhe hue research paper ke siddhanto par banaaya gaya hai
 Sir Neville Mott received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his research work in Solid State Electronics
 unhone yah kaha tha kii acharya jagadish chandra bose apane samay se 60 saal aage the
 In fact, it was Bose who predicted the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors
 biophysics ke kshetra main unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha kii unhone apan dikhaaya kii paudho main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar vaidyuthik madhyam se hota hai naa kii chemical madhyam se
 These claims were later proven to be true through scientific proyogo
 acharya bose ne sabase pehle microwave ke vanaspati ke tishyu par hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But the zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid

 The cause of brain failure after clinical death is a narrow chain that occurs after blood circulation is reversed, particularly during recovery processes that interfere with blood circulation
 ' Control of these processes is the subject of ongoing research

 Death, or clinical hypothermia, is a decrease in temperature during clinical injury, slowing the rate of body accumulation and surviving extended periods of time during which clinical death can be performed
 a decrease in the rate of injury can be approximated by the Q1 0 rule that states that the rate of biochemical reactions decreases by a factor of 0 to every 0 ° C, which can be reduced in temperature
 As a result, humans can sometimes survive clinical death at a temperature below −2 0 ° c over one hour
 The symptom of the disease is that improvement occurs earlier due to hypothermia rather than clinical death, 19 In 9 9, 29-year-old Swedish woman Anna spent 8 minutes trapped in ice and survived with complete recovery from 1 ° c core body temperature

 'vasudev' is a well-known novel written by the classical storyteller and manish Dr
 Narendra Kohli
 bharat kii puranic gaathaon main vasudev or devaki suparichit naam hai
 Everyone knows him as Krishna's parents
 kintu, unke bare main vistaar se charchaa kam hi hoti he
 Renowned novelist Narendra Kohli has tried to fill this gap with his novel 'vasudev'
 unhone vasudev-devaki ke us jeevankaal kaa varnan kiya he jisamen unki charam jijeevishaa ke darshan hote hai
 The author has made a successful attempt to depict the social, political conditions of the time, citing various developments from the marriage of Vasudev and Devaki to Kansa slaughter
 is upanyaas kii katha ‘vasudev’ kii nahin, balki ‘vasudev’ kii he
 On the ground of the person, he is moving towards purity of character, with all the blows on the surface of the society, with the blows on his chest, blowing the conch of awakening and getting armed as a true Kshatriya on the surface of politics, taking iron from all the evil forces
 Huh
 isamen upanishdon kaa advait veydant bhi he, bhagwat kii lila or bhakthi bhi tathaa mahabharat kii raajnneeti bhi
 But nowhere does Narendra Kohli forget that this work is a novel
 ek moulik srujanaatmak upanyaas
 There is no complexity or complexity in this wonderful story
 yah aaj kaa upanyaas he
 You will find very succinct story of yourself and your era in it
 lekhak ne apane upanyaas main jis plat ko liya he, uski sabhi baaten jagajaahir hai
 All its main themes are memorized to Indians
 iske baavjood yah lekhak kii kushalta hi he ki upanyaas main kahin bhi boriyat nahin hoti
 In the mythological legends, there is an equal episode between the marriage of Vasudev and Devaki and the birth of Krishna
 lekin is shunya main bhi lekhak ne bade hi taarkik dhang se kai prasangon kii rachana kii he
 This symbolizes the author's grip in the novel genre
 puure upanyaas main kul 62 adhyay hai
 28 chapters of which are about the events before the birth of Krishna
 or yahi 28 adhyay puure upanyaas ke sarvaadhik mahatvapurn adhyay hai
 In these, the depiction of the extreme life expectancy of Devaki and Vasudeva is presented with great skill
 kisi bhi pathak ke liye in adhyyon ko padhanaa apane aap main adbhut anubhav hoga
 In Vasudev, without any tampering with the Purana story, it has been worn as a logic of logic
 katha main aane vaale alokik prasang jaise krishna ke janm ke samay karagaar ke dwaar swat: khul jane ko tarksangat evam uganukool banaaya gaya he
 Concerned for the safety of their families, due to the severe rain at the time of Krishna's birth, all the sentinels of the prison left in panic and hurriedly leaving the gates open
 doosraa prasang krishna dwaara anguli par govardhan parvat dhaaran karne kaa he, jisaki vyakhya devaki ke mukh se lekhak ne is prakaar kii he, krishna ne gopaalon ko lagaakar, bhoomi khodakar mitti govardhan par chadhaakar use or ooncha kar diya, itani oonchi bhoomi taiyaar kar lee jis par saare gopal or gaay surakshit rah saken, vahaan tak baadh kaa pani nahin chadh saktaa
 Nayak Vasudeva is a symbol of power not to bow down to injustice and to continue his struggle with policy and tact
 devaki ke vivaah ke pashchaat vidaai ke samay, magadh tantric bhavishyavaanee karata he ki devaki kii santan se kansa ke praanon ko sankat he, kansa devaki ko maarane hetu khadg uthaa letaa he, yah dekhakar bhi vahaan upasthit kisi bhi vyakti ke hriday main kansa ke virodh kaa vichaar nahin aata
 Fear, helplessness and helplessness prevail everywhere in the kingdom of Kansa
 aisi sthiti main devaki ke pita devak or sage bhai bhi khadg to kya uthaate, jihva se bhi virodh nahin karte
 Vasudev, who is Devaki's husband, does not get angry, thinking with a balanced mind and trying to understand the situation
 jab kansa ne maharaja ugrasen se satta chhinakar unhen bandi bana liya tab unki sahaayta ke liye hi koi nahin aayaa, meri sahaayta koun karegaa ? at: ve sampurna sthiti kaa man hi man moolyankan karke, tatkaal hi shakti nahin varan yukti se kaam lene kaa nishchay karte hai
 The courageous and tactful Vasudeva, stopping Kansa from killing Devaki, vows to Kansa that he will hand over every child of Devaki to him
 vasudev aasthaavadi hai, unka ishwar main atoot vishwaas he
 His livelihood is inspiring
 ve kehete hai, main sainik hum or sainik tab tak apana shastr nahin chodta, jab tak uski bhujaa hi na cat jaae
 They work tirelessly to protect the child, but fail
 unke saamne chha: santanon kaa vadh ho jaataa he, parantu devaki ke saatven garbh ko rohinee ke sharir main surakshit karke, rohinee ko nandagaanv bhejne main ve safal ho hi jate hai
 He comes to the eighth child by handing himself to Nanda even under adverse circumstances
 iske pashchaat bhi vasudev kansa kii shakti ke sammukh parajeet nahin hote
 They call, learn to see our own interest in the interest of the country, if the country is not safe, none of us is safe
 kansa ke vadh ke uparaant bhi yah upanyaas samaapt nahin hota kyonki adharm kaa aadhaar stambh mathura naresh kansa nahin varan magadh naresh jaraasandh he
 After Kansa slaughter, the threat of Jarasandha's attack to end the Yadavas and destroy Mathura increases
 upanyaas ke antim drishy main, antim prishth par vasudev yadavon kaa dharmayuddh ke liye aahvaan karte hai
 Even at this time, they alone are ready for the struggle, in the crusade one does not have to think who will come with me, who will not come
 itnaa samaj lo ki main na yuddh kii avhelnaa karnaa chahta hum, na palaayan
 The Kshatriya does not withdraw from the struggle until his mind is cut off
 2 Narendra Kohli in his novel 'vasudev' has woven the narrative of the story by keeping the characters Vasudev and Devaki who were neglected in literature at the center
 is upanyaas ke sabhi pramukh paatr -vasudev, devaki, rohinee, nand, balram hamaare sammukh naveen evam tejasvi rup main prastut kiye gaye hai
 Although the author has not made any changes to the legend, all the characters and the entire plot seem to be sources of inspiration and power and relevant and that is its uniqueness
 vasudev krishna ke pita hote hue bhi krishna-sahitya main upekshit hi rahe hai, sur evam sur ke sam-samayik parvarti kaviyon kii drushti se bhi upekshit
 Vasudev either appears helpless and helpless captive in the prison of Kansa or we are familiar with Vasudeva crossing the akul ufanti Yamuna to get the son safely to Gokul at the time of Krishna-birth
 iske pashchaat kansa-vadh ke baad karagaar se mukt hone par hi vasudev drushtigochar hote hai
 Similarly, as the mother of Krishna, Yashoda only comes out in the description of Krishna's child pastimes, not Devaki
 aadhunik kaal main hindi sahitya main bhi keval pandit dwarika prasad mishra ke 'krishnayan' main or maithilisharan gupt ke 'dwapar' main vasudev-devaki kaa chithran kiya gaya he, lekin paramparaagat rup main hi
 Similarly, Rohini's character is also a shadow of Yashoda in terms of Vatsalya in Krishna-devotional poetry
 krishna or balram kii paricharchaa main hi uskaa ek do baar ullekh kiya gaya he
 Nanda's place has also been secondary
 gupt ji ke dwapar evam hariudh ke 'priy privas' main avashya nand kaa ullekh miltaa he
 While telling the story of devaki-vasudev, the author has also depicted Krishna's balalilaas with great skill
 apane purv upanyaason kii bhaanti lekhak ne is upanyaas main bhi kai prasangon kaa prachlit dharanaon ke vipareet maanvikaran kaa prayaas kiya he, unki taarkik prastuti kaa sahaara liya he
 But at the same time, he has also accepted the divine miracle in many respects
 mahabharat or krishna se jude vibhinn dharawahikon main devaki or vasudev kaa chithran praaia: ek aise asahaay mata-pita ke rup main kiya gaya he, jo haath par haath rakhkar ishwariya chamatkaar kii pratiksha karte hai
 But, in this novel, the author has drawn a completely different picture of the most difficult moments of vasudev-devaki's life
 unhone vasudev ko ek aise karmyogi ke rup main prastut kiya he jo apni vilakshan medhasakti or sooyeeboojh ke saath kansa ke anyaay kaa virodh karte hai
 'vasudev' has emerged as an innocuous persona with the help of the author's novel-art and thinking style
 ve bhartiyata ke aakhyaata hai tathaa ksht sahane main chattan ke samaan vajra-kathor hai
 He is serious, brave, knowledgeable in weapons and scriptures
 nitinipun hai or samayanukool aacharan karne vaale hai
 Even an odd situation cannot break them
 ve aastik hai tathaa prabhu kii samarthy main unka atoot vishwaas he
 Along with being patient by nature, he originated
 kshatriyochit swabhimaan unamem kuta-kuta kar bharaa he
 Classically, he is a slow-witted hero
he said that Vasudev is ethical and practical
 tatkaalik sankat se mukti paane ke liye die gaye vachan kii paalna karnaa ve aavashyak nahin samajhate isiilie apane putron ko kansa se bachaane kii yojana banaate hai tathaa saatven tathaa aathven putron kii raksha karne main safal rahete hai
 He said that Vasudev's personality is revered
 ve vikat yoddha hai tathaa mathura ke samaaj main unke prati atoot shraddha he
 Devaki, like Vasudev, is patient, courageous, believable and is seen as a powerful woman who works hard in adverse conditions
 upanyaas ke aarambh main devaki utani shaktishalini athva paripakv dikhaai nahin detii, parantu paristhitiyon kii agni main tapakar vah shashakt hoti jaati he
 Even when, after the slaughter of the first son, where Vasudeva becomes frustrated, Devaki becomes his power like a true Ardhangini
 niraashaa main duubakar jab vasudev kehete hai ham or putron ko janm nahin denge
 Devaki firmly states - We will give birth to sons so that our eighth son can finish this tyranny as soon as possible
 yahaan ham devaki ke saahsee, ojasvi, jujharu vyaktitv se parichit hote hai
 Even in Kansa's prison, Devaki looks like a deer, not a deer, but a lioness
 krishna ke janm se purv to vah bhay or ashanka ke sthaan par apurv anand main dubi hui dikhaai detii he
 Kansa is a villain in this novel - a symbol of power, power, injustice and tyranny
 vah apane pita ugrasen se dasyu ke samaan satta chhinakar, swayan raja ban jaataa he
 No one dared to oppose him because of his cruelty, strength and terror
 vasudev ke pratham putr kaa janm hone par vah uskaa vadh kar detaa he; parantu vah itnaa bhaybheet he ki shishu ke antim sanskaar ke liye vasudev ke saath kuch logon ko jane kii anumati bhi nahin detaa
 He is afraid that no protest or agitation may arise
 kansa ke liye, devaki kaa saatvaan garbh paheli ban jaataa he, at: vivash evam krodhit kansa, vasudev-devaki ko karagrih main daal detaa he
 When Vasudeva has an eighth child, he still has doubts
 use nand ke putr krishna par andeh hota he to vah use maarane ke anek asafal praytn karata he
 He eventually conspires to end krishna-balarama and sends them to Akrur to bring them to Mathura
 kintu hota vahi he, jo magadh tantric kii bhavishyavaanee thi
 The eighth child of Devaki ie Krishna kills Kansa
 rohinee is upanyaas main ek or shashakt paatr he, jo har kadam par vasudev-devaki kaa saath detii he
 She even carries the seventh womb of Devaki herself in her body and goes to Nandgaon and gives birth to Balarama
 vah dharm ke maarg par drudh rahane vaali, tatkaaleen samaaj or raajnneeti kii baarikiyon ko samajhane vaali vidhushi he
 She introduces Nanda to the politics of Mathura and the exploits of Kansa
 kansa se mukti paane kaa upaay sujhaate hue vah nand se kahati he, sabase pehle praja kii chetana ko kansa ke karagaar se mukt karnaa hoga
 3 At the end of the novel, his right to Balaram, his excesses of emotion and fascination, are indicative of his feminine weakness
 guru gargacharya, upanyaas ke ek or shashakt paatr hai jo upanyaas main shakti ke strot ke rup main saamne aate hai
 They understand the heart of religion and inspire Vasudev to struggle by showing the right path in moments of desperation and despair
 ve vasudev ko samaran karaate hai, tum par samaaj main satogun jagaane kaa daayitv he
 The cowardice of society continuously constructs a cons
 jaao sahaspurvak jivan kaa sangram lado
 4 yashoda or krishna ko paramparaagat bhoomika main hi prastut kiya gaya he
 There is no novelty in these characters
 yah avashya he ki vasudev ke nayak vasudev hai, at: krishna yahaan pramukh bhoomika main nahin hai, ve vasudev ke lakshya ko purna karne main sahaayak maatr hai
 There are many such dialogues between devaki-vasudev, Nand Yashoda, nand-rohini, vasudev-gargacharya in the novel which are very important in terms of India's current political situation and the problems prevailing therein
 adhyay 24 main ek jagah rohinee-nand samvaad vishesh rup se ullekhneey he : Rohini says to Nanda, “the illusion of the people is to remove the illusion that Kansa is their king
 ” "if the king is not Kansa then who is the king of the Yadavas?" Nanda was in some confusion
 ”koi van main rahakar praja ko luute, use peedit kare, to vah kya he?” "she is a bandit
" ” "and if he gets out of the bandit forest into the royal palace, will he become king?" Rohini said, "this confusion has to be eradicated
" rajaprasaad main rahane, rajsabha main singhaasana par baithne tathaa sena par niyantran kar lene se to koi raja nahin hota
 " narendra kohli ne yah gaatha keval aadhyatmik paksh kii na rakh aadhunik sandarbh se jod kar saral vyavhaar main likhi he
 The story can be related to today's situations even after the Dwapar era
 upanyaas main shri krishna ke janm sambandhit ghatnaayen tathaa un ke aalokik krityon ko aaj ke un vaigyanik buddhi vaale pathakon ko dhyaan main rakh kar ukera gaya hai jo 'mythology' or 'science Fiction' ke prati alag alag drushtikon rakhten hai
 After the time of the novel, it is not that you are reading a historical story, but it seems that you are seeing the picture of today's political and social environment
 kansa ko prasann karne ke liye us ke mantriyon sahit samaaj ke buddhijiviyon dwaara apni aatma bech dene kaa adhyay aaj kaa hi lagata he
 Not only this, the names and details of an education minister of Kansa brings a smile on the reader's face
 lekhak ne puri kshamta se samaaj ke un logon ko jaagrit karne kaa prayaas kiya he jo apane vaataanukoolit kakshon main baith desh kii acchhee buree dasha par apni raay dete hai or swayan vot dena bhi shame kaa kaam samajhatein hai
 The only and the main message of this saga of Devaki Vasudev is that the source, anguish and solution of every problem of the nation is in the society of the nation itself and only by the sacrifices of the people like Vasudev of the society can the country remain safe and civilized
 shri krishna jaise avtaron kaa avataran bhi inhen manishiyon kii tapasya kaa parinaam hota he na ki koi swaabhaavik prakriya
 The message of not fulfilling the duty of ruler and politics on every problem of the country and society, and then not expecting any award after that duty, is perhaps the message's inherent purpose
 yah upanyaas ek or nagayagya kaa mangalacharan he tathaa samast bharatvasiyon ko isamen aahuti dene kaa khulaa nimantran bhi isi main he
 He said that the present era is a translation of the era of Kamsa
 is yug main bhi vasudev anivaary hai
 Who can hold Krishna in their blood
 tabhi adharm kaa naash or dharm kii raksha sambhav he
 For this, the work of Vasudev is very relevant
 - arvind soral In social novels, the place that belongs to Premchand's 'godan', in the mythological-modernist novels Narendra Kohli's 'vasudev' place is no less than that
 'vasudev' manushya kii jijeevishaa, anyaay evam daman ke viruddh ladane kii uski adamya ichhashakti kaa evam uski nishkapat aasthaa evam samarpan kaa adbhut mahakavy he
 While in 'godan' Premchand has portrayed a poignant portrayal of the social system of shabby rural and urban life, in 'vasudev', Kohli has not only skillfully carved out a society that is shattered by greed, selfishness and tragedy, but also explores its causes
 It is curry
 premchand ne 'godaan' main malti evam mehta ke sanvaadon ke madhyam se apane darshanik vichaaron ko saamne rakhaa he, jo paryaapt lambe or ubaau ho gaye hai evam katha ke pravaah main vighn utpann karte hai
 The reader leaves them with cursory reading or turning the pages
 iske vipareet 'vasudev' main kohli kaa chintan sankshipt sukhtiyon ke madhyam se prakat hota he, jo pathak ke dimag ko turant pakad leti hai
 Trouble does not occur in the story, but the reader is filled with mind and contentedness on a new achievement, and goes on to read angrily in anticipation of the material
 sankshep main kaha jaye to pratipaadya, shilp or bhashaa kii drushti se 'vasudev' ke rup main hindi upanyaas ke us vikaas ke charam ke darshan hote hai jo lagbhag saat dashakon purv premchand ke 'godaan' ke rup main uplabdh hua tha
 For the future of Hindi literature, it is very encouraging that the Hindi novel has achieved this position by going through various high and low turns
 is sadi ke purvardh main narendra kohli ke rup main hindi ne us kaaljayi sahityakar ko apane viksit rup main punah praapt kar liya he jo usne premchand ke rup main pichhali shatabdi ke purvardh main khoyaa tha
 Durga is the principal goddess of Hindus who is also known as the only goddess and power
 shakt sampradaay kii vah mukhya devi hai jinaki tulana param brahm se kii jaati he
