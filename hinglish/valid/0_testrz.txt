 While the small jagirdar had a village, the elder jagirdar had officers from twelve to fifty villages and had all kinds of administration, revenue and judicial powers
 ye jagirdaar kisaanon se na keval manamaana lagaan vasuul karte the balki vibhinn naamon se anek laagabon va begaar bhi vasuul karte thea kisaanon kaa bhoomi par koi adhikaar nahin tha or jagirdaar jab chaahe kisaan ko jotane ke liye de detaa tha
 The farmer could not break even two or four seats for his children from the fields to the tail
 jabaki iske vipareet jagirdaar ke ghode un kheton main khule charate or kheti ko ujaadte rahete the or kisaan unhen kheton main se nahin hataa sakate the
 In addition, the Jagirdar used to hire a class IV employee called 'kanwaria' for the recovery and maintenance of his possessions
 yah kanavaria fasal pakane ke dinon main kisaanon kii striyon ko kheton se ghar lautate samay talaashi letaa tha yaa phir kisaanon ke gharon kii talaashi liya karata tha ki koi kisaan khet se sitiyaan todakar to nahin laayaa he
 If new grain was found at home, it would be punished both physically and financially
 lagaan ke alaava jagiradaaron ne kisaan kaa shoshan karne ke liye anek prakaar kii laagen laga rakhi thi jo vibhinn naamon se vasuul kii jaati thi, jaise malba laag, dhuna laag aadi-aadi iske alaava baith-begaar kaa boj to kisaanon par jagirdaar kii ore se itnaa baari tha ki kisaan uske dabaav se sadaiv hi chhodkar jagirdaar kii begaar karne ke liye janaa padataa tha
 Not only the farmer himself, his women also had to be forced
 unako jagiradaaron ke ghar ke liye aataa peesna padataa tha
 Their houses had to be dabbed and other household tasks were to be done whenever they wanted
 unka inkaar karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha or na hi uname itnaa saahas hi tha
 Even on doing this service, he was humiliated
 striyaan sone-chaandi ke aabhushan nahin pahan sakati thi
 She could not wear shoes with the presence of the vassal's bastion
 unhen apane juute utarkar haathon main lene passage the
 Farmers could not sit on horses
 unhe jagirdaar ke saamne khaat par baithne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 They could not carry a weapon, there used to be only two pieces of dust in the farmer's house
 pakkaa maakan bana hi nahin sakate the
 Pucca houses were only the coat or palace of the vassal
 gaanv kii shoshit aabaadi kachche makaanon yaa jhonpadiyon main hi rahati thi
 The farmers did not have the right to education
 jagirdaar log unhen paramparaagat dhandhe karne par hi baadhya karte the
 Overall the economic and social status of the farmer was very pathetic
 ji jaan se parishram karne ke baad bhi kisaan daridr hi bana rahata tha kyonki uski kamai kaa adhikansh bhaag jagirdaar or uske karmchaariyon ke gharon main chalaa jaataa tha
 In such a situation, Chaudhary Moolchand took the initiative to improve the condition of the farmers of Marwar
 choudhary shri mulchandji kaa janm visan 1944 pus krishna 6 ko nagaur se lagbhag 6 mile uttar balwa naamak ek chote-se gaanv main choudhary shri mothiramji siag ke ghar hua tha
 His mother's name was Durgadevi
 jab ye 9 varsh ke hue tab of pitaaji ne inhen najadik ke gaanv alaay main jain yeti guransaa amarvijyaji ke paas upasre main padhne hetu bhej diya
 The upasara had both food and residence facilities
 upasre ke baahar gaanv main bhi ek anya sthaan par shikshak puraani paddati se hindi bhashaa or ganit ke pahaade va hisaab karnaa aadi padhaate the, mulchandji upasre ke alaava vahaan bhi padhne jane lage
 The discipline of Jain Upasaraya with the disciplined and sobriety routine such as getting up on time, defecating, cleaning the Upasara, bathing, eating and going to school etc
, developed the habit of exercising time and hard work in Moolchandji
 teen varsh tak yahi kram chalata rahaa jisase aapako padhne-likhane va hisaab kitaab kaa puraa gyaan ho gaya
 Often you started reading and understanding all kinds of Hindi books
 kuch sanskrit ke lok bhi arth sahit yaad kar liye gayi the
 The ability to solve complex mathematical questions was also developed
 upasre main dharm-charchaa va usase sambandhit praapt pustaken, pravasi jain bandhuon se milanaa va unase charchaa karnaa aadi se aapkaa gyaan badhata hi gaya, buddhi main prakharata or vichaaron main vyavhaarik padhai main paarangat ho jane ke baad choudhary mulchandji apane adhyaaapak va jain guransaa se arshivaad lekar paas ke ek gaanv goge laav main bacchon ko padhaane hetu adhyaaapak banakar chale gayi
 While Chaudhary Sahab was a student in Alaya, he had to change his behavior as a teacher in Gogela
 gaanv main ab vidhyaarthiyon ke alaava gaanvvasi bhi aapkaa sammaan va abhivadan karte the
 You used to teach Hindi and Mathematics to students there and also teach practical knowledge and good conduct
 padhne vaale bacchon main zyaadaatar mahajanon ke bachche the
 Chaudhary Sahab met these people these days
 jo angreji jaanate the
 Then they too started feeling a lack of English knowledge in themselves and gradually the curiosity of studying English started increasing in them
 gogelav main angreji padhnaa sambhav nahin tha, kyonki ek to ve swayan adhyaaapak the or doosraa yahaan jo bhi angreji padhe-likhe log aate the, adhik samay nahin thaharte the or chuttee par chale jate the
 Finally, after the desire to study English became more and more powerful, after returning to Gogelav for two-and-three years, the bonfire returned again
 choudhary mulchandji alaav main vaapis guransaa ke paas jain upasre main rahanen lage or angreji kii shiksha praapt karne hetu railway ke babu or stesan master ke paas aane jane lage or angreji padhne lage
 Now, when Chaudhary Sahib was disgusted by eating food in Upasara, he requested the Railway Guard to get some work
 guard inhen suratgarh le gaya or vahaan railway ke pi
dablyoo
ai
 ke yahaan naukar rakhwa diya
 After working at home for a few days, the guard hired him for a railway job at eight rupees monthly, where he had to work on a water-raising machine in the tank
 inke bade bhai shri ramakaranji us samay kamaane ke liye kanpur gayi hue thea jab vah vaapis ghar aaye, choudhary mulchandji ko bhi apane saath kanpur le gayi taaki zyada kamaaya ja sake
 But when no work for them was found there, you returned to Suratgarh
 choudhary sahab ab yahaan aspataal jaakar kapoundari kaa kaam seekhney lage
 a few days later, here, you got introduced to the post office's inspector, who put him in the post office as mel-pion
 kuch dinon tak kaam seekhney ke baad aapako ek maheene main postman banaakar mahajan stesan bhej diya
 There, Chaudhary Saheb started roaming from house to house and villages to villages and people came in contact with many people, due to working very cheerfully and happily, people of all the society and classes of Mahajan were very happy with them, meanwhile they were transferred to Suratgarh
 
 vahaan vah pehle bhi rah chuke the
 You stayed for many years in Suratgarh
 is dauraan anek vishyon kii pustakon ke pathan tathaa manan or vishishtjanon ke satsang ke saath postman kaa kaary badi eemaandaaree se karte rahen suratgarh se phir aapkaa tabadalaa nokha ho gaya, jahaan dhai teen varsh ke lagbhag rahen ant main nokha se aapaki badla apane hi ghar nagaur main ho gai
 During this time, a feeling of social service had arisen in the mind of Chaudhary Saheb and he started working in this direction
 nagaur main aapako dehatho main dak vitaran kaa kaary saunpa gaya tha
 Along with your work, you started to inspire the children of farmers to study by wandering from village to village, according to the plan of your social service, village upliftment and education
 isse jagiradaaron ko badi takalif hone lagi or unhone apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar inkaa sthaanantaran ganvo se nagaur shahar kii duty par karvaa diyaan phir bhi aap apane mishan main lage rahe or jab samaaj-seva ke kaary bhaar zyada badhane laga to aapane 1935 i
 main naukari se tyaagptr dekar puure josh ke saath krishak samaaj ke utthan ke kaary main jute gayi or anek kashton ko sehate hue antim saans tak isi kaary main lage rahe
 Through education in the mind of Chaudhary Moolchand ji, the inspiration of public service came from Jat School Sangria
 aapke prayaas se 4 april 1927 ko choudhary gullaraamji ke makaan main "jat boarding house jodhpur" kii sthapana kii
 Chaudhary Moolchandji wished to open a hostel in Nagaur
 aapane apane ghar par kuch chaatro ko padhane ke liye rakhaa
 Later on 21 August 1930, the foundation of the new hostel was laid at Bakta Sagar Pond
 is chatravaas ke kharche kii puri jimmedaari choudhary mulchandji par thi
 You opened several hostels with the help of Jat leaders
 barmer main 1934 main choudhary ramdanji daukia kii madad se chatravaas kii aadharshila rakhi
 In 1935 Merta Hostel opened
 aapane jat netaaon ke sahyog se jo chatravaas khole unamem pramukh hai:- soobedaar pannaraamji dhingasra va kisnaraam ji roj choti khatu ke sahyog se deedwanaa main, ishwar raamji maharaajapura ke sahyog se maroth main, bheenyaram ji sihaag ke sahyog se parbatsar main, hetaraamji ke sahyog se khinvsar main chatravaas khulwaaye
 Apart from these hostels, a series of hostels have also been erected at places like Pipar, Kuchera, Ladnun, Roll, Jayal, Allay, Bilada, Ratkudiya, etc
 is shiksha prachaar main marwar ke jaaton ne apane pairon par khadaa hone main rajasthan ke tamaam jaaton ko peeche chhod diya
 In 1937, the Jagirdar of Chatalia village attacked 8 Dhanis of Jats and looted them and behaved inhumanly
 choudhary sahab ko isse badi pidaa hui or unhone tay kiya kii jaaton kii raksha tathaa unki aawaaj buland karne ke liye ek prabhaavshaalee sanghathan aavashyak he
 Therefore, for the benefit of the farmers of Jodhpur State, on 22 August 1938, on the occasion of the cattle fair of Parbatsar on the day of Teja Dashami, established an institution called "marwar Jat Krishak Reformatory Assembly"
 choudhary moolchand is sabha ke pradhanmantri bane or gullaraam ji ratkuriya iske adhyaksh niyukt hue
 Seeing the progress of the farmers, the vassals of Marwar went to Bokhla
 unhone kisaanon kaa shoshan badha diya or unke hamale bhi tej ho gaye
 Jat leaders are now forced to think that they should have a political organization
 sab kisaan netaa 22 june 1941 ko jat boarding house jodhpur main ikatthe hue jisamen tay kiya gaya ki 27 june 1941 ko sumer skool jodhpur main marwar ke kisaanon kii ek sabha bulaai jaae or usamen ek sanghathan banaaya jaae
 Accordingly, on that date, the establishment of Marwar Kisan Sabha was announced and Mangal Singh Kachhwaha was appointed the chairman and Balakishan as the minister
 marwar kishaan sabha kaa pratham adhiveshan 27-28 june 1941 ko jodhpur main yojit kiya gaya
 The Marwar Kisan Sabha issued several bulletins demanding an end to excessive rent and labor
 marwar kisaan sabha kaa doosraa adhiveshan 25-26 april 1943 ko sar chotu ram kii adhyakshata main jodhpur main yojit kiya gaya
 The Maharaja of Jodhpur was also present in this conference
 vastav main yah sammelan marwar ke kisaan jagriti ke itihaas main ek aitihaasik ghatana thi
 In this session, on request from the Kisan Sabha, Jodhpur Maharaj announced the introduction of land settlement in the Jagiri areas of Marwar
 marwar kisaan sabha jaaton ke liye sabase badi uplabdhi thi
 On the occasion of Jat Prajapati Mahayagya organized in Sikar in 1934, Thakur Deshraj published 'jat History', since then Chaudhary Moolchandji felt that a detailed and authentic history of Marwar's Jats should also be written because 'jat History' Very little has been written about the Jats of Marwar
 tabhi se aap thakur deshraj ji se baar-baar aagrah karte rahe
 Ultimately, this effort was successful and Thakur Deshraj traveled to Marwar from 1943 to 1953, accompanied him, traveled to famous villages and cities, collected research material, managed expenses and in 1954 "marwar The Jat History "
 marwar ke jaaton ke liye choudhary moolchandji kii yah amuly dein thi
 Chaudhary Moolchand ji was also very interested in the publication and promotion of literature revealing the pride of the Jat caste
 thakur deshraj ji dwaara likhit 'jat itihaas' ke prakaashan va prachaar main aapane bahut yogadan diya evam jagah-jagah swayan ne jaakar ise bechaa
 You had also written and published the books 'jat Veer Teja Bhajnawali' and 'veer Bhaktangana Ranabai'
 aapane jat jati ke sambandh main us samay tak jitna bhi sahitya prakashit hua tha, use mangvakar sangrah kiya tathaa uske liye nagaur ke chatravaas main ek pustkaalay sthapit kiya
 Now this library is located in your name "shri Chaudhary Moolchandji Sihag Smriti Jat Samaj Library" Kishan Kesari Shri Baldevaram Mirdha Memorial Trust Dharamshala Nagaur

 He was presented with a congratulatory letter from the farmers community of Marwar at a huge function on 17 January 1975 for his services in which you are remembered as "the pioneers of Kishan Jagriti" and "hardworking social reformer" choudhary baldev ram ji mirdha to yahan tak kaha karte the kimujhe janaseva ke kaary ko karne main yadi kisi ek vyakti ne prerana di to vah choudhary mulchand ji sihaag the

 a basic understanding of their scripts is necessary to work on computers in Indian languages
 varnanmala main do prakaar ke varna hote hai - swar vavyanjan
 Consonants are characters that cannot be pronounced as a single unit without the help of vowels, while vowels can be pronounced independently or by adding consonants
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi ham `k'varna kaa akele uccharan karen to usamen vyanjan dhwani `k' ke saath swar dhwani`a' avashya hogi
 While the vowel sound 'A' can be pronounced independently
 bolte samay ham vaakya yaa shabd main aanevaali dhvaniyon ko shrinkhalaaroop main uccharit karte hai
 If we write these accented sounds sequentially with the help of consonant vowels, then the Hindi word 'kamala' will be written in this way: yahan par, prayek vyanjan evam swar ko alag alag likhaa gaya he
 The feature in this writing method is that the spelling consonants and vowels are written according to the pronunciation
 jab shabd main uccharit dhvaniyon ko varnon dwaara uccharan kram main likhajata he tab is paddati ko varnatmak chihnavali kehete hai
 Descriptive markings are easy to understand and can be considered as the first natural step in the direction of scripting the language
 yah tankan keliye bhi upyukt he
 But its drawback is that it has to write more, due to which both the time and paper cost more
 angreji kiroman lipi ek varnatmak chihnavali he
 In English the 'kamala' soundtrack would be written as follows: k a m a l a In order to overcome the above deficiencies of descriptive markings, alphabetic signs have been developed in Indian languages
 iske antargat prayek swarant syllable ke liye ek chihn coupyog hota he jise akshar kehete hai
 Vowel syllable means zero, the alphabet consisting of vowels after one or more consonants
 udhaaharan ke liye, nimnlikhit varna-kram swarant-syllable hai:- At the end of the word, even if the vowels are not in the order of the final consonants, they can be written as letters; For example, in Hindi, the vowel of the last consonant of the word is not pronounced, but in writing there is the use of the full letter
 jaise : camel
 Hence, the letter represents one or more characters
 akshar kii sanrachana main ek aham baat yah he ki akshar kaa aakaar vyanjan vaswaron kii matraaon ke aakaar se milakar banataa he 
 So it is easy to learn them
 
 Some simple examples of descriptive and alphabetical signs are: isamen mukhya baat yah he ki vyanjan ke saath `a' swar ko jod kar ek "saral"akshar bana diya gaya
 For example: Here 'A' symbol is a simple letter Kajo 'K' is formed by mixing consonants and non-intangible vowels
 is chihnavali ke antargat vyanjanon main swaron ke yojan ke liye matraonka vikaas hua
 If a consonant is followed by a vowel other than 'A', a small special sign is placed on the letter indicating the vowel
 isi chihn ko us swar kii maatra kehete hai, jaise `u' kii maatra `u',`e' kii maatra `e', `i' kii maatra `i' ityadi
 There is no need for any additional markings when the 'a'swara comes after the consonant
 udaahranarth, Consider the difference of 'key' and 'many' in the above
 `kii' main `k' par `i' swar kii maatra he jabaki `kai' main `k' or `i' aksharkrambaddh rup main hai
 Hence, quantities are marked on a letter whether the letter is simple or compound
 har maatra ko lagane ke liye vishisht sthaan hai,jo ki akshar ke chaaron ore hai
 like:- akshar ke baayin ore 'i' kii maatra aati he, isi prakaar se 'e' va 'i'matraayen upar aati hai, 'u' va 'uu' neeche tathaa anya daayin ore
 This method is very beneficial for handwriting
 parantu tankan kii drushti se kuch kathinaaiyaanaati hai, jinka ullekh ham baad main karenge
 By doing this, writing becomes very simple
 haan, seekhney kii drushti se thodi si mehnatazyada he, chunki ab matraaon ko bhi siikhnaa padataa he
 One consequence of this invention is that in order to indicate the absence of 'A' in a simple letter, a special quantity has to be applied, which we say udaahranarth, `kya' shabd main `k' akshar par halant lagaana padataa he: The second key point is that when consonants in a word come one after the other, they are written by adding them together, which is also called conjunct
 ageanevaale swar ke anuroop maatra isi sanyuktakshar par lagati he
 For example, the word 'what' has the pure consonant 'k' and the letter 'y' which are joined by order to make the word 'kya' conjunct
 tatpashchaat saadhaaran niyam ke anusaar us par`aa' kii maatra lagaai jaati he
 Historically, this type of compound is syllabic — a sign of nothing less than a revolution
 yahi hamaari parichit aadhunik lipi he
 The rule of quantifying in an alphabetical sign applies the same to both simple and compound letters
 matlab yah he ki akshar chahesaral ho yaa sanyukt, matraupar die gaye niyamanusaar hi lagegi
 That is, the quantity of 'E' seems to be on the left side as per the rules, then it will be placed on the left side in both types of letters, such as: -a + e = a + e = ki
 or yahi niyam sanyuktakshar par bhi lagu hota he, jis karanvash `i'kii maatra sanyuktakshar ke baayin ore likhi jaaegi
 Note the conjunct in the Sanskrit word 'tasmin' given below: - 'i' maatra 'm' ke baayin ore na hokar, sanyuktakshar 'sm' ke baayin oralagati he, jo niyamanusaar he
 Each letter is taken as a marking unit under the rule of applying quantities
 akshar apane aap main swar ke bina adhooraahe
 a simple letter is the sum of just one vowel, or one consonant + one vowel, and the ligature is the sum of more than one consonant and one vowel
 matraaon ko lagane ke niyamon ke samaan hi vyanjanon ko jodakar sanyuktaksharbanane ke liye bhi saral kintu vishesh niyam hai:- vyanjanon ko baayen se daayen,yaa upar se neeche kii ore joda jaataa he
 In which the first consonant in the sequence is left or up
 baayen se daayen ke udhaaharan ham dekh hi chuke hai jaise,'ky','sm' ityadi, upar-neeche jodne ke udhaaharan neeche diye hue hai:- Since 'D' comes after 'D' in the above, 'D' is written above and 'D' is written
 sanyuktakshar banaate samay, dwitiya vyanjan ke chihn ko daayin ore likhaa jaae yaneeche, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki un vyanjanon kaa rup kaisaa he
 It is easy to connect them according to the look
 yadi dononvyanjanon ke chihnon main khadi-pai nahin he to dwitiya ko pratham ke nichelikha jaataa he, jaise 'tth'
 There are some special rules with 'R' which are made in terms of brevity
 yah niyam sanyuktakshar ke kram main `r' ke sthaan par nirbhar karte hai
 If 'R' is in the second place and there is a consonant before it and a vowel after it, while making the conjunct, a special symbol is given below the first consonant for 'su': - isi prakaar yadi `r' ke baad vyanjan he to us vyanjan ke upar ek visheshchihn laga diya jaataa he: Therefore, in the conjunct, 'su' comes up first when in consonant and comes down after it
 hamaari lipi main ek or tarika he sankshiptata se likhane kaa:- yah he anuswaraka prayog
 For the final consonant in the class of each consonant, anusvar can be used, such as: - vyanjanon kii nasikyata ke liye anuswaar kaa prayog hotahai tathaa swaron kii nasikyata ke liye anunasik kaa prayog hota he
 for example: inamen chandrabindu to swaron kii nasikyata ko chihnit karata he parantubindu kaa ekmaatr uddeshy lipi main sankshiptata laana he
 It is necessary to say here that from the language point of view it is correct to analyze only through pure consonants and pure vowels

 parantu bhashaa sansaadhan ke liye, unako hataakar shuddhvyanjan va swar main aasaani se parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 Rules like Anusvar are also in other Indian languages
 ek si varnanvyavastha tathaa aksharatmak lipi hone se sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main ek samaantahai
 Computerization of other Indian languages is easy when the script of one language is computerized
 jo takanic ek par lagaai gai ho, vah duusari bhashaonke computarikaran main bhi kaam main aa sakati he
 For example, Gist Technology works simultaneously in all Indian languages scripts on computers
 computer main tankan karne ke liye kunjeepatal kaa prayogkia jaataa he, jiskaa design hamaari ungliyon ke aakaar va haath kii lambaai paranirbhar karata he
 Therefore, there cannot be excessive changes in the shape and size of the keys
 zyada kunjiyaan hone par kunjiyon ko dhundhna va yaad rakhana kathinho jaataa he
 Therefore, typing a ligature with the same key is difficult
 computer ke aane se purv bane masini tiperiter par tankankarne main anekon kathinaaiyaan aati thim
 Firstly, if we want the typed material to appear in alphabetical signs, then it is mandatory to type it in the same markings
 atah sanyuktakshar sahit anekon chihnon kokunjeepatal par yaad rakhana padataa tha
 Second, since quantities can come around the letter, making such a machine was a complex task, and the output did not look beautiful
 in sab ko dekhte hue computer praudyogiki main yah sochaa gayaaki agar ham tankan to varnatmak chihnavali main kar saken, par computer screenpara parichit aksharatmak chihnavali dikh padey to acha hoga
 Successful development of this technology has been done with this as the basis
 ye sab kamiyaan computer ke aagmanase samaapt ho gai hai
 But it is necessary that we understand the interrelationship in descriptive and alphabetical signs
 man main yah prashn bhi uth saktaa he ki tankan ke liye yadi varnatmak lipi koman liya jaataa to ye sari pareshaaniyaan dur ho jaatin
 But since alphabetic script was prevalent in handwriting, it was not thought to use descriptive script
 yah ek udhaaharan he, jahaan ek behatar vigyaan honeke kaaran, praudyogiki kaa upyog nahin kiya gaya kyonki vah abhi us strapar nahin pahaunchi thi
 Probably, for this reason, the circulation of the raid was not as uprooted as it should have been
 is praudyogiki ko upyog main na laane se jo hamen haani hui vah sarv-viditahai
 Perhaps this was also one of the reasons that Europe overtook us in science
 in baton ke bare main ab keval anumaan hi lagaaya ja saktaa he, nischitarup se kuch kahana kathin he
 The question may arise that if the letter is a sum of pure consonants and vowels, then what is quantity? Why is m + e = Egypt, why is 'M_' not? These are given below in the form of a unitary equation
 yahan maatra va swar chihnon ke sambandh ko ham ek ganitiya sameekaran ke rupamen dekhenge
 We have seen many examples of signs including quantity and without quantity
 jaise:- We also know that 'A' can be broken into pure consonants and vowels: - uparokt 'k' ke mulya ko sameekaran main daahine ore rakhaa ja saktaa he:- Similarly, 'Q' can be subtracted from both sides of the equation, just as 8 is reduced in the mathematics example
 tathaa donon ore se `k' ko hataane par ham pate he:- The above is an important equation, which gives the value of the 'I' vowel as its quantity
 uparokt main, 'i' swar kaa mulya matraaon main likhaa gaya he
 Now we will display the value of quantity in tone
 pehle dekhaten hai ganit ke sameekaran ko
 In the left part of the equation, if we add zero, we get: - ab yadi 0 ke sthaan par rakhen:- 1 + to:- Similarly, now let us see how the volume is related to its tone
 iskaa pataa lagane ke liye hamen lipi ke shunya kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 We know that Halant subtracts 'A', namely: - ab sameekaran main baayi ore ke hisse main `k' ke baad shunya jodne se hamemiltaa he:- By subtracting 'A' from both sides, yaa, ise aise bhi likh sakate hai:- This equation shows that the value of quantity 'E' is the solitary deposit 'E'
 arthath, 'i' main halant nihit he tathaa vah apane se purv akshar main se `a'ko ghataata he
 The same thing said above for 'E', the same thing applies for other quantities as well
 atah :- Halant is in a way a negative object, just like a negative number
 jis prakaar rinatmak sankhya koek dhanatmak sankhya main jodne par dhanatmak sankhya kaa maan kam ho jaataa he,usee prakaar se halant ko apane se purv akshar main jodne par usamen se 'a'ghat jaataa he
 The use of Halant is a specialty of Indian languages
 halant kaavishkaar bharat main hua, tathaa kadachit is prakaar kii avadharana anya kisibhasha main nahin he
 In India, there has been a special work on language, just as on geometry in Greece
 bharat ne vishwa ko shunya ki avadharana di,tathaa is sabko dekhte hue lagata he ki yah aashcharya kii baat nahin hogi yadibharat main shunya kii avadharana bhashaa main viksit hokar ganit main gai ho
