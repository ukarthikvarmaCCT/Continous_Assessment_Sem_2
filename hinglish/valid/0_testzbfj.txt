 The performance was widely discussed and millions of people watched the video on youtube
 Boyle was "absolutely shocked" by the intensity of this reaction

 Boyle left the clinic five days after her admission and said that she would join the BGT tour

 Similarly, Entertainment Weekly stated that Boyle's presentation was a triumph of talent and artistry in a culture obsessed with physical attractiveness and performance
 Modern society is too quick to judge people on their appearances
 There is not much you can do about it; it is the way they think; it is the way they are
 But maybe this could teach them a lesson, or set an example
 The Washington Post believed that his initial gait and home form provoked the judges and spectators that they were "waiting for him to scream like a duck"
 The New York Daily News stated that ridiculing or insulting an innocent person and then enjoying an unexpected victory is a common metaphor in literature and was the sharp contrast between the audience's poor expectations and the quality of its songs
 Boyle's performance made it an attractive piece of television

 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus

 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today

 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire

 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz

 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake

 yadi unhone ek nirvaat main se hokar ek duuri par kriya ke gupt vichaar par bharosa nahin kiya hota to ve gurutv kaa apana siddhant viksit nahin kar pate
 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
 1677 main, newton ne phir se yantriki par apana kaary shuru kiya, arthath, gurutvkarshan or grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon ke sandarbh ke saath, grahon kii kaksha par gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav or is vishay par hook or flemustid kaa paraamarsh

 a common example of this is two ice skates move opposite to each other and then slide in opposite directions
 ek anya udhaaharan he bandook kaa peeche kii or dhakka mahasoos karnaa, jisamen bandook ke dwaara goli ko daagne ke liye us par lagaaya gaya bal, ek baraabar or vipareet bal bandook par lagaataa he jise goli chalaane vaala mahasoos karata he
 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different
 arestu ke vipareet, newton kii bhautikee saarvatrik ho gayi he
 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone
 duusare niyam kii sadish prakruti bal kii disha or vastu ke samveg main parivartan ke prakaar ke bich ek jyamitiya sambandh sthapit karti he
 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move
 newton ne darshaya ki is ke bajaay surya kaa andar kii or ek aakarshan bal aavashyak hota he
 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted
 or kai vaigyanikon ne descartes ke vortices ke siddhant ko variyata di
 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth
 " isi prakaar ke shabdon main, volter mahakavy kavita par niabandh main likhaa, "sar ijac newton kaa apane baganon main gum rahe the, ped se girte hue ek seb ko dekh kar, unhone gurutvkarshan kii pranali ke bare main pehali baar sochaa
 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked
 mul vriksh kaa vanshaj trinity college, cambridge ke mukhya dwaar ke baahar uga hua dekha ja saktaa he, yah us kamare ke neeche he jisamen newton padhai ke samay rahata tha
 The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale can supply grafts from trees that look similar to the Flower of Kent, a coarse pulp variety

 Sad dramas are plays in which the protagonist struggles with adversity and powers and ends up facing crisis
 bahuton kaa mat he ki tegedy kii kathavstu kaa ant nayak kii mrityu main hona chahie, yadhyapi pracheen unani natyasahitya main do ek aisi kritiyaan bhi hai jinamein nayak kii mrityu nahin hoti kintu phir bhi jinaki parigananaa tragedy kii koti main hoti he
 It is also generally believed that the protagonist of a tragedy or grief drama is characterized by sublime and elitist virtues, although in modern grief dramas, which represent the conflict between the individual and society, there are many exceptions
 tragedy ke nayak hi main nahin varan uske kathanak tathaa uski kavyastylee se bhi garima kaa abhas miltaa he
 The protagonist is defeated and annihilated, fighting the opposing forces, but in moral terms he proves to be excellent and successful
 garima or vishalata kii pratiti na keval sampurna rachana se, kintu uske pramukh upkarnon se bhi hoti he
 The fundamental question regarding tragedy is why the hero is distressed and destroyed
 apni yatnaa or mrityu ke liye vah kis ansh main swayan jimmedaar he, yah samasya darshakon, prekshkon or aalochakon ke man main nirantar uthati he or iskaa niraakaran vibhinn prakaar se kiya gaya he
 In the ancient Greek tragedy, the hero is more and more guilty of corrupt attitudes, misleading feelings, or momentary charge
 nayak ke charitra main ghaatak durbalata evam tadjanit yatnaa or mrityu kii kalpana isai dharm ke prabhaav se 16veen shatabdi main prakat hui
 This belief is effectively represented in Shakespeare's sorrowful plays
 shakespeare ke du:khant naatakon main nayak mukhyat: apni kamajoriyon kaa hi shikaar banataa he yadhyapi uske vinaash main niyati or paristhitiyon kaa haath bhi sadaiv rahata he
 In modern tragedy, the hero's fall is due to social forces or dynasty, so the responsibility of the hero remains small

 Aristotle presented a detailed explanation of the tragedy in the fourth century BCE after a serious study of the grief plays available
 uske matanusaar tragedy aisi maanavkriya kaa anukaran he jo gambhirtha purna, tathaa samyak, aakaraukt he
 The idea is that there is no place for humor and humor in tragedy, it has proper planning of beginning, middle and end and the size of the drama is as long as possible
 arestu ne kathavstu, charitra, vichaar, style, sangeet, tathaa drishividhan ko tragedy ke aavashyak upkaran mana he or uskaa yah mat thode se antar ke saath aaj bhi manyata rakhata he
 The effect of the tragedy is explained by Aristotle on the basis of catharsis theory
 tragedy ke prekshan or adhyayan se man main karun or bhay kaa aaveg niyantrit hota he tathaa un du:khad bhaawanaaon kaa parishkar hota he
 In Latin, Seneca composed gruesome plays that express violence and vengeance in a vigorous style
 madhyayug main tragedy kii visheshtaayen kathasahitya or tatpashchaat navdith aadhunik europea natyasahitya main prakat hone lageen
 During the Renaissance period, the Tragedy embraced ancient and new influences simultaneously, and their amalgamation led to the emergence of high-quality sad plays in many countries of Europe in the 16th century AD
 is sambandh main marlo, shakespeare, kalderaan aadi ke naam vishesh ullekhneey hai
 In the second half of the 16th century, Carnil, Rasin Prabhriti, the French playwrights, achieved special success in composing gruesome plays written on classical conventions
 ye naatak shakespeare tathaa anya svachhndathawadi naatakakaron kii kritiyon se nitant bhinn the kyonki unamem un niyamon kaa paalan kiya gaya tha jinaki avhelnaa shakespeare aadi ne kii thi
 For example, Carnil and Raseen etc
 recognized the rule of theatrical inventions which the libertarians had devised
 18veen shatabdi main garhasthya jivan tathaa saamaanya madhyavarg se sambandhit du:khant naatak europe ke kai deshon main likhe gaye
 But it is disputed whether we can call them tragedy or not
 aise naatakon ke liye 'syrius drama' naam prayukt hua he jo aadhunik shatabdi kii anek natya rachanaaon ke liye bhi upyukt he
 Lessing was first pointed out to the difference between tragedy and serious drama
 19veen shatabdi main swachhandathawad ke navotthana ke kaal main shakespeare tathaa unke samasamyik naatakakaron kaa adarsh adhikadhik sweekaar kiya gaya
 Therefore, the importance of certain classical rules was very low
 duusari smaraneey baat yah he ki darshanik hegel ne apane dwandvatmak darshan ke aadhaar par tragedy kii ek naveen evam chamatkaarpurn vyakhya prastut kii
 Hegel holds that the conflict or conflict of opposing forces for tragedy may be due to external influences or internal attitudes
 isi navi dhaaran ke aadhaar par pracheen natyasahitya kaa anushilan kiya gaya tathaa tragedy ke naveen rup prakat hue
 Many sad plays written in the 19th and 20th century, based on the strong struggle between individual and social forces, have their origin in Hegel's new establishment
 tragedy ke anek adhyatan rup uplabdh hai
 Hauptmann succumbs to the fatal effects emanating from the hero lineage in Ibsen Prabhriti's grief-plays
 samasyamoolak naatakon main tragedy kaa jo rup miltaa he use syrius drama kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 The best form of tragedy in the present day is found in poetic plays, and now the notion is becoming increasingly firm that pure tragedy is possible only in the field of poetry
 tragedy ke do mukhya bhed hai shastrokt evam svachhndathawadi
 In the classical tragedy, the stricter urge of rules relating to exploration, justification, etc
 has been accepted
 svachhndathawadi tragedy main prabhaav aikya kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he kintu nishchit niyamon kii praaia: sampurna avhelnaa hoti he
 Apart from these two major categories, many other forms of tragedy have developed in modern times such as social tragedy, psychological tragedy etc
 tragedy kaa naveenatam rup pracheen unani tragedy se kuch bhinn hone par bhi atyant vaividhypurna or rochak he
 It is not only necessary for the tragedy that its hero dies in the end
 yadi kisi durghatana main kisi kii achaanak mrityu ho jaati he, vah tragedy kaa vishay nahin hoga
 It is necessary that the hero be destroyed after prolonged torture and courageous struggle with the opposing forces, which will lead to attraction and respect in our mind

 a strong willpower in the hero of the tragedy is essentially desired
 tragedy ke aise bhi udhaaharan hai jinamein niyativaadee swar pramukh he
 In such plays there is a feeling of despair and depression, but the actions and effects of the protagonist are not at all negligible

 lahore prastaavna,, san 1940 main akhil bhartiya muslim lig dwaara prastaavit ek aadhikarik rajnatik sankalpana thi jise muslim lig ke 22 se 24 march 1940 main chale teen divasiy lahore satr ke dauraan paarit kiya gaya tha
 The proposal called for "independent princely states" for Muslims, allegedly in the northwestern eastern regions of British India, and to make the provinces included in the said units autonomous and sovereign
 tatpashchaat, yah sankalpana "bharat ke musalamaanon" ke liye pakistan naamak main ek alag swatantra swytt mulk banane kii maang karne main parivartit ho gaya
 Although the name Pakistan had already been proposed by Chaudhary Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, by 1933, Majloom Haq Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other Muslim leaders were firm on the principle of Hindu Muslim unity, but the partition encouragement misconceptions constantly being promoted by the British
 Hindus had aroused a sense of mistrust and hatred towards Muslims
 a sensitive political environment had also promoted the proposal of Pakistan is prastaav kii peshi ke upalaksh main prativarsh 23 march ko pakistan main yom-e-pakistan ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The historic resolution was passed at the end of the three-day annual meeting of the All India Muslim League at Minto Park, Lahore on 23 March, on the basis of which the Muslim League started the movement for the acquisition of a separate country of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and After seven years, it was successful in getting its demand passed
 upmahadweep main british raaj dwaara satta janata ko saunpane kii prakriya ke pehle charan main 1936 / 1937 main pehle aam chunaav hue the unamem muslim lig ko buree tarah se haar uthaani padi thi or uske is daawey ko gambhir nicha pahunchi thi ki vah upmahadweep ke musalamaanon ke ekmaatr pratinidhi sabha he
 Therefore, the morale of the Muslim League leadership and workers was shattered and there was a strange sense of helplessness on them
 congress ko madras, you pi, si pi, bihar or urisa main spasht bahumat hasil hui thi, seemaa or bombay main usne duusare dalon ke saath milakar gathbandhan sarkaar kaa gathan kiya tha or sindh or assam main jahaan muslim haaavee the congress ko kaaphi safalataa mili thi
 In Punjab, however, the head of Inam Hussain's uninusset Party and in Bengal Maulvi Kripa Haq's Praja Krishak Party won
 garaz bharat ke 11 praanton main se kisi ek rajya main bhi muslim lig ko satta praapt na ho sakaa
 In these circumstances, the Muslim League, it seemed, is diverging from the political stream of the subcontinent
 is dauraan congress ne jo pehali baar satta ke nashe main kuch zyada hi sir shaar thi, aise upaay kiye jinase musalamaanon ke dilon main bhay or khataron ne janm lenaa shuru kar diya
 As the Congress declared Hindi as the national language, the Gao decay was banned and the Congress tricolor was given the status of the national flag
 is maamle main muslim lig kii satta khone ke saath apane netritv main yah bhaavana paidaa ho rahaa tha ki muslim lig satta se is aadhaar par vanchit kar di gai he ki vah apane aap ko musalamaanon kii pratinidhi sabha kehalaati he
 This was the starting point for the awareness of the spirit of two separate nations led by the Muslim League
 isi dauraan dwitiya vishwa yuddh samarthan ke badale satta kii bharpoor hastantaran ke masale par british raaj or congress ke bich charchaa bhadkaa or congress satta se alag ho gai to muslim lig ke liye kuch daravaaje khulte dikhaai die
 And in this background, this 3-day meeting of All India Muslim League in Lahore started on 22 March
 baithak se 4 din pehle lahore main allamaa purvi ke deen party ne pabandi todate hue ek sainya parade kii thi jise rokane ke liye police ne golibari kii
 Around 35 Deen were killed
 is ghatana kii vajah se lahore main jabardast tanaav tha or punjab main muslim lig kii sahyogi party uninst party satta thi or is baat kaa khatra tha ki deen ke fawda vaahak kaaryakarta, muslim lig kaa yah baithak na hone den yaa is avasar par hangaamaa barapa he
 Incidentally, in view of the seriousness, Muhammad Ali Jinnah addressed the inaugural session in which he said for the first time that the problem in India is not communal, but Ben International means it is a problem of two countries
 unhone kaha ki hinduon or musalamaanon main antar itnaa bada or spasht he ki ek kendriya sarkaar ke tahat unka gathbandhan khataron se bharpoor hoga
 He said that there is only one way in this matter that i have different afflictions
 duusare din inhen padon par 23 march ko is samay ke bengal ke mukhyamantri maulavee krupa haq ne sankalp lahore diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is tab tak koi sanvaidhanik yojana na to vyavhaarya hoga or na musalamaanon ko hoga jab tak ek duusare se mili hue bhugolic ikaayiyon alag gaanaa kshetron main parisemen na ho
 The resolution said that in these areas where Muslims have a numerical majority, such as the Northwest and Northeast regions of India, they should be set free by combining them with units that have high autonomy and sovereignty
 maulavee inaam ul dwaara kii peshkash kii is sankalp kaa samarthan upi ke muslim legi netaa choudhary riek lsamaan, punjab moulana jafar ali khan, seemaa se sardaar aurangzeb sindh se sir abdulla haaron or baluchistan se kaaji isa ne kii
 The resolution was passed in the closing session on 23 March
 april san 1941 main madras main muslim lig ke sammelan main sankalp lahore ko party ke samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya or isi ke aadhaar par pakistan andolan shuru hui
 But even then these areas were not clearly identified, including the demand for separate Muslim states
 pehali baar pakistan kii maang ke liye kshetron kii pahchaan 7 april san 1946 dilli ke teen divasiy sammelan main kii gai jisamen kendriya or prantiy vidhansabhaon ke muslim legi sadasyon ne bhaag liya tha
 At this conference, a resolution was passed to present the demand of the Muslim League to the delegation of the Cabinet Mission coming from Britain, which was drafted by two members of the Executive of the Muslim League, Chaudhary Riksalam and Hassan Isfahani
 is karaadaad main spasht rup se pakistan main shaamil kiye jane vaale kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai thi
 Bengal and Assam in the northeast and Punjab, Seema, Sindh and Balochistan in the northwest
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is sankalp main kashmir kaa koi zikr nahin tha haalanki uttar pashchim main muslim bahul kshetra tha or punjab se judaa hua tha
 It is very important that the two states were completely omitted from the Delhi Convention in this resolution, which was very clear in the resolution Lahore, instead it was demanded as the only state of Pakistan
 shaayad bahut kam logon ko yah pataa he ki sankalp lahore kaa mul masauda us jamaane ke punjab ke uninst mukhyamantri sar sikandar hayaat khan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The Uniunsat party was integrated into the Muslim League at that time and the head Sikandar Hayat Khan was the President of the Punjab Muslim League
 sir sikandar hayaat khan ne sankalp ke mul masaude main upmahadweep main ek kendriya sarkaar ke aadhaar par lagbhag condereshan prastaavit thi lekin jab masauda muslim lig subject cameti main vichaar kiya gaya to kaayade ajam mohammad ali jinna ne khud is masaude main ekmaatr centre sarkaar kaa ullekh moulik kaat diya
 The head Sikandar Hayat Khan was strongly angry on this and stated clearly in the Punjab Legislative Assembly on 11 March 1941 that his vision of Pakistan was mainly different from the principles of Jinnah Saheb
 unka kahana tha ki vah bharat main ek ore hindu raaj or duusari ore muslim raaj ke aadhaar par vitaran ke sakht khilaaf hai or vah aisi bakaul unke vinaashkari vitaran kaa datakar muqabla karenge
 But this did not happen
 sir sikandar hayaat khan duusare varsh san 1942 main 50 saal kii umr main nidhan ho gaya yun punjab main mohammad ali jinna teevr virodh ke uthte hue hisar se mukti mil gai
 In the Delhi session of 1946, the resolution of Pakistan was presented by Sankalp Hussain Shaheed Sohrawardy and it was praised by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyakalsam
 sankalp lahore pesh karne vaale maulavee krupa haq is sammelan main shariq nahin hue kyonki unhen sun 1941 main muslim lig sekharaj kar diya gaya tha
 At the Delhi conference, Abu Alhashm, the leader of Bengal, strongly opposed this resolution and argued that this resolution is quite different from the Lahore resolution which is part of the constitution of the Muslim League - he said that the resolution was clearly in Lahore in two states There was no option to amend this basic resolution of the Muslim League to the Delhi Convention
 abavaalhashm ke anusaar kaayade ajam ne isi sammelan main or baad main bombay main ek baithak main yah samajhaayaa tha ki is samay ke baad upmahadweep main do alag samvidhan vidhansabhaon ke gathan kii baat ho rahi he to dilli kanvension sankalp main ek rajya kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 But when the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan sets the constitution, it will be the final arbiter of this problem and it will have full authority to decide the formation of two separate states
 lekin pakistan kii samvidhan sabha ne na to kaayade ajam jivan main or na jab san 1956 main desh kaa pehla samvidhan paarit ho rahaa tha upmahadweep main musalamaanon kii do swatantra or swytt rajyon ke sthapana par vichaar kiya
 After 25 years of political upheaval and conflict and the destruction of the Bangladesh war in Sun 1971, but two different afflictions of Muslims emerged in the subcontinent, whose resolution is still safe in the case of Lahore

 However, despite heavy publicity by RCA, sales of television sets in New York during the 1939–1940 period were dismal, mainly due to the high cost of the set and the lack of regular compelling programs
