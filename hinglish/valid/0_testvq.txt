 Rahul Sankrityayan - He has considered the period from 8th to 13th century as the creations of siddha-sammat era

 for their asylum king and feudal lords

 This opinion of Rahul ji is also not accepted by scholars
 kyonki is namakaran se loukik ras kaa ullekh karanevaali kisi vishesh rachana kaa pramaan nahin miltaa
 The poetic tendencies of Nathpanthi and Hathayogi poets and Khusrau etc
 are not included in this name
 hu Acharya Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi - He named the first period of Hindi literature as bij-bapan period
 unka yah naam yogya nahin he kyonki saahitiyik pravritiyon kii drushti se yah kaal adikaal nahin he
 This period is a development of the literary tendencies of the preceding defined apostrophes
 acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi- inhone hindi sahitya ke itihaas ke praarambhik kaal ko adikaal naam diya he
 Scholars also consider this name more appropriate
 is sandarbh main unhone likhaa he- vastutah hindi kaa aadi kaal shabd ek prakaar kii bhraamak dharna kii sristi karata he or shrota ke chitt main yah bhav paidaa karata he ki yah kaal koi aadim, manobhavapann, paramparawinirmukt, kavy-rudhiyon se achoote sahitya kaa kaal he
 It is right there
 yah kaal bahut adhik parampara-premi, rudhigrast, sajag or sachet kaviyon kaa kaal he
 The name Adikal is more worthy because from the point of view of literature, this period is only the development of the Apabhramsa period, but from the point of view of language, it gives information about the language which has advanced beyond the defined Apabhramsa
 acharya hajariprasad dvivedi ne hindi sahitya ke adikaal ke lakshan-nirupan ke liye nimnlikhit pustaken aadharbhoot bataayi hai- Thus, the name of the first period of the history of Hindi literature as the nomenclature itself is worthy and meaningful, because by this name, there is a sense of the extensive place on which the later literature stands
 bhashaa kii drushti se is kaal ke sahitya main hindi ke praarambhik rup kaa pataa chalata he to bhav kii drushti se bhaktikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kii sabhi pramukh pravritiyon ke aadim beej isamen khoje ja sakate hai
 The main forms of the styles of this period are found in the later periods
 adikaal kii aadhyatmik, shringaarik tathaa veerta kii pravritiyon kaa hi viksit rup parvarti sahitya main miltaa he
 For this reason, the ancient name is the more appropriate and comprehensive name

 is band ne duniyabar main 100 million se zyada elbum beche hai or unhen VH1 ke hard rock ke mahanatam kalakaaron ke kaarykram main 46waan sthaan praapt hua tha
 "rock You Like a Hurricane" is also at number 18 on vh1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs
 45 varshon ke gane or bajaane ke baad bhi yah band daure kar rahaa he or sangeet ricard kar rahaa he
 On 24 January 2010, the band announced that they would stop the tour after touring in support of their upcoming album Sting in the Tale
 is band ke layaaddh guitaravadak rudolph shenakar ne 1965 main yah band shuru kiya tha
 The band initially had an impressive rhythm and Schenker himself sang
 varsh 1969 main jab shenakar kaa chota bhai maaikel evam gayak close min band main shaamil hue tab kaam miljul kar hone laga
 1972 main is group ne apana pehla elbum lonsam kro ricard kar jari kiya jisamen lother himberg ne veena or volfgang digiyani ne drum bajaayaa tha
 During the tour of 'lonesome Crow', Scorpions joined the UK emerging band UFO
 Near the end of the tour, UFO members proposed guitarist Michael Schenker to play the lead guitarist, which he quickly accepted
 shenakar bhaaiyon ke mitra uli roth ko daure ko puraa karne ke liye asthaayee rup se bulaayaa gaya
 The band disintegrated after Michael Shenker left
 In 1973, Uli Roth, who assisted the Scorpions in completing the 'lonesome Crow' tour, was offered the role of lead guitarist, but turned down the offer and preferred to remain with the Dan Road Band
 shenakar ne aakhirkaar yah nirnay liya ki vah roth ke saath kaam karnaa chahta he lekin vah scorpions kii antim pankti ko punerjeevit nahin karnaa chahta tha
 He attended some of Dan Road's rehearsal events and eventually decided to join a band that included Roth, Francis Buchhose, Achim Kirshning, and Jürgen Rosenthal
 roth or buchahoj ne rudolph shenakar ko samajhaayaa ki ve close min ko shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kare, jo usne sheeghra hi kiya
 While the band had more members of the Dan Road than the Scorpions, they decided to use the name of the Scorpions as it was well-known on the German hard rock table and an album had been released under the name
 1974 main scorpions kii nai fouj ne "fli tu di renbo " jari kiya
 The album was more successful than Lonesome Crow and songs such as "speedies Cumming" and the title track set up the band's sound
 After recording, Achim Kirshining decided to leave
 thode hi samay baad jurgen rosenthal ko bhi chhodana padaa kyonki ve sena main bhartee ho rahe the
 Then in 1976 he would join a German progressive rock band called Aloy and would record three albums with him
 Belgian drummer Rudy Lennars was replaced by him
 1975 main in trans ke jari hone ke saath band ko badi safaltaaen milin jiske saath hi german nirmaataa dieter dierux ke saath scorpiunya ke lambey anubandh kii shuruyaat hui
 yah elbum scorpions ke liye bada kadam tha or isane unke hard rock sutara ko dridhtaa se sthapit kar diya, iske saath hi desh or videsh, donon jagah unke chaahane waalon kii sankhya kaaphi ho gai
 Filming of "dark Lady", "robot Men" and the title track are still very much loved by fans
 1976 main scorpions ne virgin killer jari kiya
 The naked girl on the cover of this album was covered with broken glass
 aavaran kala kii dizin stephen bohale ne taiyaar kii thi jo us samay unke label aaarasie ricards kaa utpaadan prabandhak tha
 The cover drew considerable criticism from the band and was withdrawn or changed in many countries
 Despite the controversy, the album's music was highly praised by critics and fans
 agle varsh kharaab swasthya ke kaaran rudi lanners ne tyaagptr de diya or unke sthaan par harmen rarebel ko liya gaya
 RCA Records made a relentless effort to sell the album in stores and on radio due to the follow-up action by Taken By Force
 The album's single song "steamrock Fever" was included in some of rca's radio promotion records
 Roth was not happy with the commercial steps the band was taking
 haalanki unhone band ke japan daure par abhinay kiya, lekin doharaa jeevant elbum tokio teps ke jari hone se pehle hi apana band electric san gathit karne ke liye alag ho gayi
 Tokyo Tapes was released in the US and Europe, six months after its release in Japan
 By that time, in mid-1978, after sound-testing around 140 guitarists, the Scorpions recruited new guitarist Matthias Jabs
 jabs ke judane ke baad, scorpions ne apane agle elbum lavadrive ko ricard karne ke liye aaarasie ko chhodkar marakari records ko chunaa
 maadak padaarthon ke upyog ke kaaran uafo se nikaale jane ke kuch saptaah baad maaikel shenakar bhi is elbum kii recording ke dauraan thode samay ke liye is group main laut aaye
 isse band main teen guitaravadak ho gayi 
 iske kaaran lavadrive elbum aisa bana jise kuch aalochak unke karier kaa shikhar maanate hai
 'scorpion's Formula' is strongly tied to hard rock songs mixed with melodic songs, incorporating fan favorite songs such as "loving You Sunday Morning", "always Somewhere", "holiday" and the instrumental "coast to Coast"
 The album's provocative artistry was named "best Album Sleeve of 1979" by Playboy magazine, although it was changed when released in the US

 Vedantasutra has not asked to take the words 'light', 'day' etc

 According to the Katyayana Shrutasutra, the trailing animal is injured near the ear and killed
 jatukarnya ke mat se shav ke vibhinn bhaagon par pashu ke unheen bhaagon ke ang rakhe jate hai
 But Katyayan does not believe this, because after doing this, the bones of the animal will also be collected while collecting the bones, so by their opinion only the meat parts should be put in the body parts
 shatapath brahman aashvalyangriysutra ne kaha he ki pashu kaa prayog vikalp se hota he, arthath yaa to pashu kaata ja saktaa he yaa chhod diya ja saktaa he yaa kisi brahman ko de diya ja saktaa he

 The Shatapatha Brahmin and the Parskar Grihyasutra have clearly written that the funeral procession of the person who has performed the Upanayana rites is done in the same way as the person who performs the fire of Shrout Agnihotra, the difference is only that Ahitagni is burnt with the three Vedic fire
 Is the one who has only the Smarta Agni or Aupasana Agni, he is burnt with it and the corpse of ordinary people is only plain The loan is lit with fire

' mantra
 parskar grihyasutra ne vyavastha di he ki ek hi gaanv ke rahane vaale sambandhi ek hi prakaar kaa krity karte hai, ve ek hi vastra dhaaran karte hai, yagyopavit ko daahine kandhe se latakaate hai or baayen haath kii chauthi angulii se vaajasaneyi samhita ke saath jal tarpan karte hai tathaa dakshinabhimukh hokar jal main dubkee lete hai or anjali se ek baar jal tarpan karte hai

 On the corpse placed on the pyre, the wind blows from the end of his garment, the funeral attendant takes a water pitcher and holds his head firmly and revolves around the corpse thrice
 purohit ghade par ek pathar yaa kulhadi se dhimi chot karata he or 'ima aap: aadi' kaa paath karata he
 When the torrent of water starts coming out from the broken pitcher, there is some change in the words of the mantra, such as 'space etc
' instead of 'asmin Loke'
 antyeshtikarta khadey rup main jalpurna ghade ko peeche phenk detaa he

 It has further stated that the corpse is carried in a car or by four men and is stopped at four places while carrying and the earth is dug in those four places and the body of the bhat is' Pusha Tvette 'and' Ayurveda: 'is kept as aahuti with mantras
 varah puraana ke anusaar puranic mantron kaa uccharan karnaa chahie, antyeshtikarta ko chita kii parikrama kerani chahie or uske us bhaag main agni prajvalit kerani chahie jahaan par sir rakhaa rahata he
 There are several types of rules regarding the carrying of the dead body
 hamane upar dekh liya he ki shav gaadi main le jaaya jaataa tha yaa sambandhiyon yaa naukaron dwaara vishisht prakaar se bane palang yaa kursi yaa arathi dwaara le jaaya jaataa tha
 Some sources, memoirs, commentaries and other texts have given many rules in this subject

 adipurana ko uddhrut karte hue haralata ne likhaa he ki yadi koi kshatriya yaa vaisya kisi daridr brahman yaa kshatriya ke yaa daridr vaisya ke shav ko dhota he, vah bada yash evam punya paata he or snaan ke uparant hi pavitra ho jaataa he
 Normally even today people of the same caste carry or carry a dead body and after bathing with clothes, are considered holy
 kuch madhyakaal kii tikaaon, yatha mitakshra ne jati-sankeernata kii bhaavana se prerit hokar vyavastha di he ki "yadi koi vyakti premavash shav dhota he, mrit ke parivaar main bhojan karata he or vahiin rah jaataa he to vah das dinon tak ashauch main rahata he
 This rule applies only if the corpse carrying the dead remains of the caste
 yadi brahman kisi mrit shudra ke shav ko dhota he, to vah ek maas tak apavitra rahata he, kintu yadi koi shudra kisi mrit brahman ke shav ko dhota he to vah das dinon tak ashauch main rahata he
 "the Koram Purana has given that if a Brahmin carries a dead Brahmin's body with a fee or does so for any other selfishness, he remains impure for ten days and similarly a Kshatriya, a Vaishya and a Shudra would do so
 If it is in order, it remains unholy for 12, 15 and 30 days

 should not be taken by the Shudra for the funeral of the higher varnas, otherwise the dead person will always remain in the prelative state
 haralata kaa kathan he ki yadi shudron dwaara lakdi le jaayi jaye to brahman ke shav ke chita-nirmaan ke liye brahman hi prayukt hona chahie
 Memories and Puranas have arranged that the dead body should be bathed, the dead body should never be burnt naked

 After burning the dead body, as a part of the funeral procession, the doer has to have a bath and after that a bath has to be done, but there are many rules regarding the sacrifice
 smriti-vachan yon he-'dadhi-munch banvaanaa saat baton main ghoshit he, yatha-gangatat par, bhaskar kshetra main, mata, pita yaa guru kii mrityu par, shrautagniyon kii sthapana par evam somayajna main
 'the funeral worker says that the son or any other performer of the funeral should first take a bath and then take the dead body to a holy place and bathe there, or if such a place is not there, the body Ganga, Gaya or other pilgrimages should be invoked in the bathing water
 iske uparant shav par ghi yaa til ke tel kaa lep karke pun: use nahlaana chahie, nayaa vastra pehanaanaa chahie, yagyopavit, gopichndan, tulsi kii maala se sajaana chahie or sampoorn sharir main chandan, kapur, kunkum, kasturi aadi sungadhit padaarthon kaa prayog karnaa chahie

 garud puraana ke mat se ghor rudan shavadah ke samay kiya janaa chahie, kintu dah-karm evam jal-tarpan ke uparant rudan-kaary nahin hona chahie
 There is no unanimity about the euphemism or burning that is caused by the dead and the funerals
 aashvalyan grihyasutra ne keval ek baar jal-tarpan kii baat kahi he, kintu satyasharh shrautasutra aadi ne vyavastha di he ki tilmishrit jal anjali dwaara mrityu ke din mrit kaa naam evam gautra bolkar teen baar diya jaataa he or aisa hi pratidin gyarahawein din tak kiya jaataa he
 Gautama Dharmasutra and Vasistha Dharmasutra have arranged that the burning is carried out by the devotees on the first, third, seventh and ninth day, facing south, but Hardatta's statement that in all, 75 Anjalias should be given, but the tradition in his country was that on the first day Anjali used to give more water thrice and in the following days one more Anjali
 vishnu dharmasutra, prachetha evam pathinsi ne vyavastha di he ki mrit ko jal evam pind das dinon tak dete rahanaa chahie
 Shuddhiprakash has quoted certain words of the Home Minister, writing that only 10 Anjaliyas are given by the opinion of some, and 100 Anjaliyas by the opinion of some, and therefore 55 Anjaliyas are given by the opinion of some people, so the people follow the tradition according to their Vedic branch
 should do
 yahi baat aashvalaay grihyasutra ne bhi kahi he
 The Garuda Purana also discusses 10, 55 or 100 Anjali
 kuch smritiyon ne jati ke aadhaar par anjaliyon kii sankhya di he
 According to the opinion of Pracheta, 10, 12, 15 and 30 Anjalias should be given to the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra deceased
 yama ne likhaa he ki naabhi tak pani main khadey hokar kis prakaar jal dena chahie or kaha he ki devon evam pitaron ko jal main or jinka upanayan sanskaar na hua ho, unke liye bhoomi main khadey hokar jal tarpan karnaa chahie
 It has come in a memory quoted by the Devayanik that 6 bodies should be given in the following form before death; At the death site, at the threshold of the house, at the crossroads, at the cremation ground where the dead bodies stop, on the pyre and while collecting the ashes
 smritiyon main aisa bhi aayaa he ki lagaataar das dinon tak tel kaa deepak jalaana chahie, jalpuran mitti kaa gadaa bhi rakhaa rahanaa chahie or mrit kaa naam-gautra kahkar dopaher ke samay ek mutthi bhaat bhoomi par rakhana chahie
 It is called Patheya Shraddha, because it helps the dead to go to Yamlok
 kuch nibandhon ke mat se mrityu ke din sapindon dwaara vapan, snaan, gram evam ghar main pravesh kar lene ke uparant nagn-prachhaadan naamak shraadh karnaa chahie

 annapurn ghade kii gardan vastra se bandhi rahati he
 With the name of Vishnu, both the characters are given to an elite poor Brahmin
 smritiyon evam puraanon ke mat se anjali se jal dene ke uparant pake hue chaaval yaa jau kaa pind tilon ke saath darbh par rakh diya jaataa he
 There are two opinions in this subject
 yajyavalcysmriti ke mat se pindpitruyajna kii vyavastha ke anusaar teen dinon tak ek-ek pind diya jaataa he; vishnu dharmasutra ke mat se ashauch ke dinon main pratidin ek pind diya jaataa he
 If the dead person is upanayed then the body is given on the object, but the mantra is not read, the body is also given on the stone
 jal to prayek sapind yaa anya koi bhi de saktaa he, kintu pind putr detaa he; putraheenta par bhai yaa bhatija detaa he or unke abhaav main mata ke sapind, yatha-mamaa yaa mamera bhai aadi dete hai
 In such a situation when the bodies are given for three days or when Ashauch remains only for three days, Shatatap has given the number of objects 10 and Parskar has divided them as follows; First day 3, second day 4 and third day 3
 kintu daksh ne unhen nimna rup main baanta he; pratham din main ek, duusare din 4 or tisare din 5
 Parskar has numbered 10, 12, 15 and 30 bodies according to caste
 varanasi sampradaay ke mat se shavadah ke samay 4, 5 yaa 6 pind tathaa mithila sampradaay ke anusaar keval ek pind diya jaataa he
 With the view of Grihaparishta and Garuda Purana, all those who have started to perform deeds on the day of death, whether they are sagotra or any other gotra, have to do all the deeds till this day
 aisi vyavastha he ki yadi koi vyakti karm karata aa rahaa he or isi bich main putr aa upasthit ho to pratham vyakti hi 10 dinon tak karm karata rahata he, kintu gyarahawein din kaa karm putr yaa nikat sambandhi karata he
 The Matsya Purana states that for the dead, the sacrifice should be for 12 days, these bodies are able to go to another world for the dead and they satisfy it
 mrit 12 dinon ke uparant mritatmaon ke lok main chalaa jaataa he, at: in dinon ke bheetar vah apane ghar, putron evam patni ko dekhtaa rahata he
 Just as it is compulsory to give water to spouses and philanthropists of the same gotra, similarly it is mandatory to give water to a person after his death to his maternal grandfather and his two other ancestors and Acharya
 vyakti yadi chaahe to apane mitra, apni vivaahita bahin yaa putree, apane bhaanje, shvashur, purohit ko unki mrityu par jal de saktaa he
 The Paraskaragrihyasutra has indicated a peculiar pattern
 jab sapind log snaan karne ke liye jal main pravesh karne ko udyat hote hai or jab ve mrit ko jal dena chaahate hai to apane sambandhiyon yaa saale se jal ke liye is prakaar prarthana karte hai-'ham log udakkriya karnaa chaahate hai', is par doosraa kahata he-'aisa karo kintu pun: na aana
 'it was done only when the deceased was less than 100 years of age, but when he was 100 years or above, it was only called' do it '
 gautamapitrumedhasutra main bhi aisa hi pratikatmak vaartalap aayaa he
 a coroner, sagotra or brother-in-law takes a thorny twig and prevents them from entering the water and says, 'do not enter the water'; After this, Sapind replies - 'we will not enter the water again
 ' iskaa sambhavat: yah taatpary he ki ve kutumb main kisi anya kii mrityu se chhutkaaraa paayenge, arthath sheeghra hi unhen pun: nahin aana padegaa yaa kutumb main koi mrityu sheeghra na hogi
 Some people are deemed unfit to give water to the dead and some dead people are also disqualified to get water
 napunsak logon, sone ke choron, vratyon, vidharmee logon, bhrunahatya karne vaali tathaa pati kii hatya karne vaali striyon, nishiddh madh pine waalon ko jal dena manaa tha
 Yajnavalkyasmriti has arranged that atheists, those who do not live in four types of ashrams, thieves, husbands who kill husbands, adulterers, goldsmiths, suicides, should neither burn water when they die nor celebrate ashoucha
 yahi baat manusmriti ne bhi kahi he

 unka maananaa he ki ishwar akaal or nirankaar he
 The Sikh Panth has a sacred and unique place in India, the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev is the originator of Sikhism
 unhone apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue 
 He founded Sikhism on the firm foundation of love, service, hard work, philanthropy and brotherhood
 tajjub nahin ki ek udaaravaadi drushtikon se gurunanak dev ne sabhi dharmon kii achchhaayiyon ko samahit kiya
 His main precept was that God is one, He created all
 hindu musalmaan sabhi ek hi ishwar kii santan hai or ishwar ke liye sabhi samaan hai
 He has also told that God is true and man should do good deeds so that he does not have to be ashamed in the court of God
 gurunanak ne apane ek sabad main kaha he ki pandit pothee padhate hai, kintu vichaar ko nahin boojhte
 Teaches others, this makes their business of Maya
 unki kathani juthi he, ve sansar main bhatakate rahete hai
 They have no idea of the essence of couplet
 ye pandit to vaad-vivaad main hi pade rahete hai
 Guru Arjun Dev even goes so far as to say that God is pervasive like fire is absorbed in all vegetation and ghee is absorbed in milk
 isi tarah paramatma kii jyoti oonch-neech sabhi main vyaapt he paramatma ghat-ghat main vyaapt he- To make Sikhism strong and Maryadasampada, Guru arjun-dev did a huge historical and eternal work by editing the Adi Granth
 unhone aadi granth main paanch sikh guruon ke saath 15 santon evam 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko bhi sasamman shaamil kiya
 The names of these five gurus are - Guru Nanak, Guru Angaddev, Guru Amardas, Guru Ramdas and Guru Arjun Dev
 sheikh farid, jayadev, trilochan, sadhana, namdev, veni, ramanand, kabir, ravidaas, peepa, saitha, dhanna, bheekhan, parmanand or surdaas 15 santon kii vaani ko aadigranth main sangrahit karke guruji ne apni udaar maanavtaavaadi drushti kaa parichay diya
 Not only this, he ranked the compositions of 14 creators like Haribans, Balha, Mathura, Gaynd, Nalh, Bhalla, Salh Bhikkha, Kirat, Bhai Mardana, Sundardas, Rai Balwand and Satta Doom, Kalsahar, Jalap and gave them a high status
 did
 yah adbhut kaary karte samay guru arjuna dev ke saamne dharm jati, kshetra or bhashaa kii kisi seemaa ne avrodh paidaa nahin kiya
 He knew that all these gurus, saints and poets have the same cultural, ideological and thinking base
 ullekhneey he ki guru arjunadev ne jab aadigranth kaa sampaadan-kaary 1604 i
 main purna kiya tha tab usamen pehle paanch guruon kii vaniyan thim
 After this Guru Gobind Singh finalized the Adigranth by incorporating the voice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur
 aadi-granth main 15 santon ke kul 778 pad hai
 Of these 541 are from Kabir, 122 from Sheikh Farid, 60 from Namdev and 40 from Sant Ravidas
 anya santon ke ek se chaar padon kaa aadi granth main sthaan diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that these compositions stored in Adi Granth are completely safe without any change for more than 400 years
 lekin apane dehavsaan ke purv guru govind singh ne sabhi sikhon ke aadhyatmik maargdarshan ke liye guru granth sahab or unke sansaarik disha-nirdesan ke liye samooche khalsa panth ko ‘guru pad’ par asin kar diya
 At that time Adigranth came to be accepted as Guru Sahib
 sikh dharm ko kaaljayi banane ke liye guru govind singh ne sabhi dharmon or jatiyon ke logon ko guru-shishy-parampara main dikshit kiya
 He created this new human being for centuries to come
 yah nayaa manushya jatiyon evam dharmon main vibhakt na hokar dharm, maanav evam desh ke sangrakshan ke liye sadaiv katibaddh rahane vaala he
 This structure of taking everyone along is, no doubt, the Sikh psyche
 phir, sikh dharm kaa param lakshya maanav-kalyaan hi to he
 Perhaps to teach the lesson of this human welfare, Guru Govind Singh wrote a long letter to Aurangzeb, which mentions the praise of God as well as the poignant mention of injustice and atrocities that took place during Aurangzeb's reign
 is patr main nek karm karne or maasoom praja kaa khun na bahaane kii naseehaten, dharm evam ishwar kii aad main makkaari or jhooth ke liye chetavanee tathaa yoddha kii tarah maidan jang main aakar yuddh karne ke liye lalkaar he
 It is said that Aurangzeb's rage arose after reading this letter and after that he did not live long
 guru ji se ek baar bhent karne kii uski andaruni ichha bhi puri na ho saki
 It is not a credit to be given that the values on which the simple, simple, simple and natural life of the Sikh Gurus was based, they had certainly adopted those values from the traditional Indian consciousness
 desh, kaal or paristhitiyon kii maang ke anusaar unhone apane vyaktitv ko dhalkar tatkaaleen rajnatik, saamaajik, dharmik, aarthik evam saanskrithik jivan ko gahare main prabhavit kiya tha
 Sikh Gurus influenced the religion and social order of their time
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko ek nai disha di
 He removed devotion, knowledge, worship, spirituality and philosophy from a narrow circle and brought the society among those who were completely deprived of it
 isse logon kaa aatmbodh jaagaa or unamem ek nai drushti evam jagriti panpi, ve swanubhoot anubhav ko manyata dene lage
 In this way the flow of the formless ultimate power was intensified and quickly received
 sikh dharm kii ek anya marke kii vishistataa yah he ki sikh guruon ne manushya ko udhyam karte hue jivan jeene, kamaate hue sukh praapt karne or dhyaan karte hue prabhu kii prapti karne kii baat kahi
 He believed that a person who works hard remains free from all worries
 guru nanak ne to yahan tak kaha he ki jo vyakti mehnat karke kamata he or usamen kuch daan-punya karata he, vahi sahi maarg ko pahachaanata he
 The 'langar' system introduced by Sikh Gurus is an example not found elsewhere in cosmopolitanism, human love, equality and generosity
 sikh guruon ne kabhi na murajhaane vaale saanskrithik evam naitik mulyon kii bhi sthapana kii
 He had foreseen with his philosophical and spiritual thinking what the time would be like
 isliye unhone andhi nakal ke khilaaf vaikalpik chintan par jor diya
 Physical practice and humor is considered to be an essential part of life
 punjab ke lokgeeton, lokanrutyon evam hola mahallaa par shastradhariyon ke pradarshit kartabon ke mul main sikh guruon ke prerana-beej hi hai
 The roots of these folk songs and folk dances erupt from the soil of Punjab and cause panic among the people
 bhangada or giddha punjab kii saanskrithik shaan hai, jisaki dhadkan desh-videsh main praaia: suni jaati he
 Punjabi culture is the backbone of nationality
 iske praan main ekatv he, iske rakt main sahanubhuti, sahyog, karunaa or maanav-prem he
 Punjabi culture connects man and builds his identity
 vishwa ke kisi kone main ghumta-phirata punjabi swayan main se ek laghu punjab kaa praturup he
 Every Sikh has his or her own independent consciousness, which has been seriously thinking about solving life-related problems in its own light
 sikh guruon kaa itihaas uthaakar dekh lijie, unhone samrajyavaadee avadharana katai nahin banaai, ulte saanskriti, k dharmik evam aadhyatmik saamanjasy ke madhyam se maanavtaavaadi sansar kii drushti hi karte rahe
 The people of this earth have maintained their peaceful existence in spite of the period of indo-pak partition before independence and several decades after the violent violence and persecution in Punjab
 kaundh inkaa maargdarshan karti rahi he
 Sikhs have ten gurus
 shri guru granth sahib ji sikhon kaa dharmik granth he
 Sikhism begins with "one"
 sikhon ke dharm granth main "ek" kii hi vyakhya hai
 One is known by the names of Nirankara, Parbrahma etc
 nirankaar kaa swaroop shri gurugranth sahib ke shuruyaat main bataaya he jisko aam bhashaa main 'mul mantra' kehete hai
 Almost all religions worship this "one", but the various stages of "one" are mentioned and explained in Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji is unique in itself
 jeev aatma jo niraakaar he, us ke paas nirankaar ke sirf 4 hi gun vyaapt he As soon as the other four qualities are attained, the living soul goes back to Nirankar, but in order to attain it, it is necessary for the living soul to understand itself through the knowledge of Gurmat
 ise sikh dharm main "aatam chintan" kaha jaataa he
 The formless form of the soul is known in the basic Sikhs of Sikhism
 in kii gatividhion ko samaj kar insaan khud ko samaj saktaa he
 Sikhism begins with soul knowledge
 aatma kya he? kaha se ai he? vajood kyon he? karnaa kya he itihaadi ruhaniyat ke vishe sikh prachaar dwaara padhaaye jate hai
 What are the disorders of the soul, how should the disorder be free aatma swayam nirankaar kii ansh he
 Gets knowledge of nirankara by making it known
 sikhmat carmik falsafe main yakeen nahin rakhata
 Other religions say that God likes good deeds and God does very bad things with those who are bad
 lekin sikh dharm ke anusaar insaan khud kuch kar hi nahin saktaa
 a human being is limited to thinking only, that is what is in the "order", whether it is donating to a poor person or if he is killing someone
 yahi baat shri gurugranth sahib ji ke shuru main hi drudh karvaa di thi : That is why sin is not accepted in Gurmat
 agar insaan koi kriya karata he to wo antar aatma ke saath awaz mila kar kare
 It is Karna that Gurmat is against Karma scandal
 shri guru nanak dev ji ne apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue jan-saadhaaran ko dharm ke thekedaaron, pandon, piron aadi ke changul se mukt karne kii koshish kii
 It is mandatory for the following four 'substances' to be received by humans in their lifetime: dharm, arth, kaam, moksh ko chaar padaarthon main nahin liya gaya
 Mr
 Guru Gobind Singh Ji says: sikhamat main bhakton evam satguron ne nirankaar ko akar rahit kaha he
 Because earthly substances are finished one day but Parabrahma never dies
 isi liye use akaal kaha gaya he
 Not only this, the living soul is also devoid of form and is tied with this body for some time
 iskaa vajood sharir ke bagaiyr bhi he, jo aam manushya kii budhi se dur he
 It is Karna that Sikhism is strongly against idol worship
 satguruon evam bhakton ne murti pujakon ko andha, jaanavar itiyadi shabdon se niwaja he
 His picture cannot be made
 yahi nahin koi bhi sansari padaarth jaise kii kabar, bhakton evam satguruon ke itihaasak padaarth, pratimaayein adik ko poojana sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 Knowledge of religious texts is a method that leads to the country of Nirankar, before which the Sikhs bow down, but the worship of religious texts is also against the basic principles of Sikhs
 sikhamat main har jeev ko avatar kaha gaya he
 Every living being is part of that nirankar
 sansar main koi bhi panchi, pashu, ped, itiyadi avatar hai
 In the cunt of Manush, the creature has descended to complete his knowledge
 vyakti kii puja sikh dharm main nahin he "maanukh ki tech birthi sab jaanat, dene, ko eke bhagwaan"
 All avatars do not come full on the condition of a nirankar
 yahi kaaran he kii sikh kisi ko paramatior ke rup main nahin maanate
 Yes, if an avatar preaches Gurmat then Sikhs are definitely associated with that sermon
 jaisaa kii krishna ne gita main kaha he kii aatma marati nahin or jeev hatya kuch nahin hoti, is baat se to sikhamat sahamat he lekin aage krishna ne kaha he kii karm hi dharm he jis se sikh dharm sahamat nahin
 Prophet is one who spread the message or knowledge of Nirankar in the common folk
 jaisaa kii islam main kaha he kii mohammad aakhri paigambar he sikhon main kaha gaya he ki "har jug jug bhakt upaaya"
 Devotees are born equal and spread the message of Nirankar to the people
 sikhamat "laa elaha ill allaah " se sahamat he lekin sirf mohammad hi rasul allaah he is baat se sahamat nahin
 Arjun Dev ji says "dhur ki baani aayi, tein sagli chinta mittai", meaning that i have uttered a voice and my real concerns have disappeared that i have found it in whose eyes i was sitting

 aadi granth yaa aadi guru granth yaa guru granth sahib yaa aadi guru darbar yaa pothee sahib, guru arjuna dev dawaara sangrihith ek dharmik granth he jisame 36 bhakton ke atmik jivan ke anubhav darj hai | aadi granth is liye kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen "aadi" kaa gyaan bharpoor he | jap bani ke mutabik "sach" hi aadi he | iskaa gyaan karwaane vaale granth ko aadi granth kehete hai | iske hawaale swayam aadi granth ke bheetar hai | halaaki vidwan tabaka kahata he kyonki ye granth main guru teg bahadur ji kii bani nahin thi is liye yah aadi granth he or satguru gobind singh ji ne 9wein mahale kii bani chadhaai is liye is aadi granth kii jaganh guru granth kaha jane laga | Satguru Arjun Dev ji was present in the form of speech books of devotees and Satgurus
 Bhai Gurdas Ji wrote this book and Satguru Arjun Dev became the guide
 He also recorded his speech in the book
 Many copies of this book were also prepared
 aadi granth ke 1430 panne khalsa dawaara maanakit kiye gaye | The Dasam Granth is a Sikh scripture which is a collection of the sacred words and compositions of Satgur Gobind Singh Ji
 guru gobind singh ji ne apane jeevankaal main anek rachanaayen kii jinaki choti choti pothiyaan bana deen
 After his death, on the orders of his religious wife Mata Sundari, Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa and other Khalsa brothers collected all the works of Guru Gobind Singh ji and put it in a book which is today called "dasam Granth"
 sidhe shabdon main kaha jaye to guru gobind singh ji ne rachana kii or khalse ne sampadanaa kii
 The entire Sikh community is entertained by the Dasam Granth
 dasam granth kii vaaniyaan jaise kii jaap sahib, tav parasaad savaiye or chopai sahib sikhon ke rojaanaa sajadaa, nitnem, kaa hissaa he or yah vaaniyaan khande bate kii pahole, jis ko aam bhashaa main amrit chakna kehete hai, ko banaate vakt padhi jaati hai
 In the gurudwaras of Takhat Hazur Sahib, Takhat Patna Sahib and Nihang Singh, the Dasam Granth is lighted with Guru Granth Sahib and is also taken daily
 sarbloh granth ore bhai gurdas kii vaaren shankaa grast rachanaae hai | halaaki khalsa mahima sarbloh granth main susajit he jo satguru gobind singh kii pramanit rachana he, baaki srbloh granth main karm cond, vyakti puja itiyadi vishe mojood hai jo sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf hai | bhai gurdas kii vaaron main murti puja, karm sidhaant adik gurmat viruddh shabd darj hai No historical source is considered complete for the history of Sikhism
 Sri Guru Sobha has assumed such a book which has been written by a Sikh near Gobind Singh but dates are not given in it
 There are other historical texts of Sikhs such as Shri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth, Gurbilas Patshahi 10, Shri Gur Sobha, Manhima Prakash and Panth Prakash, Janamsakhiya Itiyadi
 Sri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth is explained in Gurdwaras
 Once Gurbilas Patshahi was 10
 Most of the history has been written after 1750
 The scholars who wrote history were mostly Sanatani, due to which, in some historical books, Satguru and devotees have shown miraculous, which according to Gurmat philosophy is not right
 Guru Nanak flying in the air, riding a crocodile, Baba Budha's oblation of Mata Ganga is embodied in the historical events of Jamsakhis and Gurbilas and later historians have written these things by putting a spice on them
 No Satgur and devotee wrote their world history
 Satguru Gobind Singh has also written as much as he has written briefly and bluntly
 Sikhism does not give much importance to history, which is useful for understanding Sikhism as much as it is useful for Sikhism
 aaj sikh itihaas kaa shuddhikaran karne main lage hai

 No
 But that's because i write for a living, and i have no other source of income, and i Naïvely believe that stuff that i create belongs to me, and that if you want it you might have to give me some cash
 My view is i do this for a living
 The thing wouldn't exist if i didn't make it and so it belongs to me and don't steal it
 You know
 It's my stuff

61054 Linlithgow is a royal city located in western Lothian, Scotland
 yah pashchimi lothian kaa ek county he, or county kaa naam linlithgoshaire iske naam par he
 It is an ancient city located at two of its most important tourist destinations, Linlithgow Castle and south of Lake Linlithgow and north of the Union Canal of Scotland

 In fact, "linlithgow" refers to the folk itself, the city is also known by the name of Lithgow
 yahan ke kai logon ke upnaam bhi lithgo hai
 Old proverbs also associate this name with the Gallic language liath gu ie "light black dog"
 The town has a generally east-west orientation and is centred on what used to be the main edinburgh-stirling road; this now forms the main thoroughfare called the High Street
 Plots of farmed land, known as rigs, ran perpendicular to the High Street and comprised much of the town's development until the 19th century
 Growth was restricted to the north by Linlithgow Loch, and by the steep hill to the south, but, in the late 19th & early 20th centuries, development began to take place much further south of the High Street
 In the late 20th century, demand for housing saw many residential developments take place much further south, as well as spreading into new areas
 This southward development was bisected by the Union Canal and latterly the main edinburgh-glasgow railway line, and today the limited crossings of both cause problems with modern traffic as there are only three places where each can be crossed in the town
 To the west, Linlithgow Bridge used to be a somewhat distinct village with its own identity, but in the latter half of the 20th century it was enveloped in the expansion of the main town and today the distinction between them is hard to make out

 aitihaasik bhashavigyaan ke sandarbh main, kisi bhashaa kii dhwani kaa koi bhi parivartan jo us bhashaa ke swanimon kii sankhya yaa unka vitaran badal de, swanik parivartan yaa dhwani parivartan kehalaata he
 Language is considered dynamic and variable
 prayek bhashaa main aantarik parivartan kii prakriya nirantar chalati rahati he
 This change or change continues at all linguistic levels like phonetic, morphological, semantic etc
 in sabhi parivartanon main dhwani parivartan mukhya rup se sabase adhik kriyasheel rahata he
 Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari has put the sound changes in the following sections based on the form- dhwani parivartan aitihaasik or bhugolic donon kaarnon se hota he
 The formation of the word 'fire' from 'fire' will be called sound change
 tatsam shabdon main dhire-dhire dhwani parivartan se hi tadbhav shabdon kaa nirmaan hua he
 Similarly, contact with other languages also results in sound changes in the language
 kisi bhashaa kaa jab bhugolic vistaar hota he to vah apane mul boli ke swaroop ko chhodane lagati he
 It changes so much over time from historical order that its form is completely different from its original geographical or local form
 udhaaharan ke liye- hindi kaa bhugolic vistaar hone par vah apane mul sthaneey khadi boli rup se baahar nikal kar rajasthani, bhojpuri, braj, avadhi, maithili tak se sambhddha hokar bhashaa ke rup main parivartit ho gari
 Convenience or effort in speech is one of the main reasons for the change of voice
 praaia: bahut se shabdon ke uccharan ke samay unamem aane vaali kathin dhvaniyon ko suvidha ke liye aasaan dhwani main badal kar uccharit karne kii pravriti milti he
 For example, if there is difficulty in pronouncing the combined consonant, one of its consonants is easily omitted to pronounce the word, for example, 'two' of 'bi', or 'neh' pronunciation of 'affection'
 iske atirikt aasaan dhvaniyon ke prayog yaa dhvaniyon ke kram main parivartan ke dwaara bhi uccharan ko suvidhjanak banaaya jaataa he
 Like 'brahmin' pronunciation of 'brahmin'
 isi prakaar apane aas-paas kii dhvaniyon ke kaaran bhi kori dhwani prayog main aate-aate parivartit ho jaati he
 For example, if there is a Ghosh dish around a dishonor dish, it becomes Ghosh
 jaise 'kankan' kaa 'kangan' yaa 'shaak' kaa 'saag'
 Similarly, due to similarity with some other words, the sounds of some words are changed due to their being spoken like them
 jaise- sanskrit kaa 'ekadash' shabd 'dwadash' ke saadrishy par 'ekadash' ke rup main bolaa jane laga
 In addition to these historical changes, there are also sound changes due to the interaction of languages
 ek bhashaa ke kuch shabd jab duusari bhashaa main apanaae jate hai to unamem dhwani parivartan hota he
 For example, 'mumbai' is the corresponding form of Marathi
 jiskaa hindi main parivartit tadbhav rup 'bombari' or angreji main 'bambe' he
 This sound change is due to language differences or geographical changes
 bhugolic vistaar ke kaaran bhi dhwani parivartan hota he
 Changing the area changes the language
 jis bhashaa kaa bhugolic vistaar hota he uski dhvaniyon ke uccharan main desh-bhed se bhi anek parivartan hote hai
 These changes of sound change can be called alternative forms of the same sound form

 Tolerance is an important concept of engineering
 yah bataata he ki kisi tantra yaa utpaada ke kisi bhautik raashi ke nirdhaarit maan se kitna ghat-batch yaa vichlan apekshit / sweekaarya he
 It is known that in any production process no absolute value of any parameter can be obtained, rather it is possible to have some deviation
 jaise yah kahana ki amuk chhed kaa vyas 2 semi hona chaiye - apane aap main apurna vishishti he kyonki kisi bhi tareeke se thik-thik 2 semi vyas kaa chhed nahin ban saktaa yaa kai chhed banane par unamem aapas main purnatah samanta nahin ho sakati
 There will be some error or mutual deviation in it, no matter how small it may be
 vichlan kii maatra is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kitne sahi aujaar prayog kiye gayi; koun si vidhi prayukt hui; bahari vyavadhaanon par kitna niyantran rakhaa gaya; kitni kaarykushalta vaale shramik ne ise banaaya aadi
 Thus tolerance can have any of the following meanings: kisi prakram yaa utpaada ke bimaayen, gun aadi nirdhaarit maan se kuch simit maatra main ghat-batch hone se uski kaaryashiltaa par koi vishesh prabhaav nahin daalate
 Tolerances are specified keeping in mind the fact that no process / substance / product is completely lossless and on the other hand that little variation does not have a huge adverse effect on the work
