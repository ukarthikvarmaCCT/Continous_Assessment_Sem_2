 Motivated by selfishness during the revolution, most of the native rulers remained loyal to the company

 a policy of subordinate cooperation was adopted towards them and these were considered strong pillars of the empire

 Very soon these differences created a terrible state of tension

 The two sides never clashed face to face, but these two groups continued to create such an atmosphere that the danger of war was always visible

 No real war was fought in this war

 According to Manon - Cold War two opposing ideologies - capitalism and imperialism, two systems - bourgeois democracy and proletarian dictatorship, two factions - NATO and Warsaw Pact, war between two states - US and Soviet Union and two leaders - John Foster Illas and Stalin Which had an impact on the whole world
 is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki shityudh do mahashaktiyon ke madhya ek vaak yuddh tha jo kootnithik upayon par aadhaarit tha
 It was a direct expression of the tension created between the two superpowers after World War II
 yah vaicharik yuddh hone ke kaaran vaastavik yuddh se bhi adhik bhayanak tha
 The symptoms of the Cold War began to appear only during the Second World War
 donon mahashaktiyaan apane-apane sankeern swaarthon ko hi dhyaan main rakhkar yuddh lard rahi thi or paraspar sahyog kii bhaavana kaa dikhaava kar rahi thi
 The spirit of cooperation that was visible during the war was beginning to end after the war and the symptoms of the Cold War had clearly started to emerge, with both factions strengthening the feeling of complaining to each other
 in shikayaton ke kuch sudrudh aadhaar the
 These mutual differences were the main causes of the Cold War, the following are the main reasons for the origin of the Cold War

 isko badhaava dene main donon shaktiyon ke bich vyaapt paraspar bhay or avishvaas kii bhaavana ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 The moves by the two superpowers against each other provided a strong basis for this cold war, and finally the two superpowers openly criticized each other and created an atmosphere of fear and unrest in the whole world, both superpowers were equal in promoting it
 Was a partner of iske vikaas kram ko nimnlikhit charnon main samajha ja saktaa he- The true form of the Cold War emerged during this time

 Following are the major events that gave rise to the Cold War in this period
 is samay main donon mahashaktiyon ke vyavhaar main kuch badlaav aane kii sambhaavna dikhaai dene lagi
 This era saw a change in the leadership of both countries
 soviet sangh main stallin kii mrityu ke baad khushchev ne shashan sambhaala or america main raashtrapati ijan haavar ne shashan kii bagdor apane haath main lee
 Attempts were made by the Soviet Union to establish a cordial relationship between the two countries, but they did not yield any positive results and Cold War tension continued in the US and the Soviet Union
 is dauraan kuch ghatnaayen ghati jinhone sheet yuddh ko badhaava diya
 Thus in this era, the actions that promoted the Cold War took place from both sides
 lekin donon mahashaktiyon ne sheet yuddh ke tanaav ko kam karne kii disha main bhi kuch prayaas kiye
 Khrushchev traveled to the United States from September 15 to September 28, 1959, to sweeten relations between the two countries and reduce tension
 5 sitambar 1963 ko america, soviet sangh or britain ke bich ‘masco aanshik pareekshan nishedh sandhi’ hui
 This called for a positive step to end the Cold War
 gutnirpeksh aandolan ne bhi is dauraan sheet yuddh ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya lekin in sabhi prayaason ke parinaam nakaaratmak hi rahe or donon mahashaktiyon main tanaav bana rahaa
 After the Cuban crisis in 1962, there was some moderation in the cold war atmosphere and the feeling of tension between the two factions was seen to be amicable and a sense of friendship
 isse donon deshon ke madhya madhur sambandhon kii shuruyaat hone ke lakshan prakat hone lage
 This softening or reduction in tension is termed as 'ditant' or 'stress-shakthilya'
 ditant ne shityudh se utpann puraane antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa paridrishy badalane laga or vishwa main shantipurna vaataavaran kaa janm hua
 It also increased the role of the United Nations and got rid of the terror of nuclear war
 1970 ke dashak kaa ditant afghanistan sankat ke janm lete hi nae prakaar ke sheet yuddh main badal gaya
 This crisis is called the 'last funeral procession'
 isse ditant kii samaapti ho gai or donon shaktiyon main lagbhag ek dashak tak rahane vaala tanaav shithily ke din lag gaye or puraane tanaav phir se badhane lage
 The main reasons for its origin are: in sabhi kaarnon se nae sheet kaa janm hua or ditant kaa ant ho gaya
 This created a new problem in international relations, America posed a threat to world peace through Gulf doctrine
 is nae sheet yuddh ne vishwa ko tritiy vishwa yuddh ke kagaar par laakar khadaa kar diya
 This led to loss of mentality and a major setback to disarmament
 isse tanaav ke kendra afghanistan, kampuchea, nikaragua aadi desh ho gaye
 This war was anti-soviet Union rather than anti-ideology

 This war corrupted the environment of the entire world

 It had the following effects on international relations - is tarah kaha ja saktaa he ki shityudh ne antarrashtriya sambandhon par vyapak prabhaav daale
 It encouraged the trend of conflict in the world by dividing the whole world into two groups

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Ecosystem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 An ecosystem is a natural unit that includes all organisms of a particular region, ie plants, animals, and molecules that interact with their abiotic environment to form a complete biological unit
 is prakaar paaritantr anyonyashrith avyavon kii ek ikai he jo ek hi awaas ko baantate hai
 Ecosystems usually form numerous food webs that show the interdependence of these organisms and the flow of energy within the ecosystem
 paristhitiki tantra shabd ko 1930 main roy clafam dwaara ek paryaavaran ke sanyukt shaareerik or jaivik ghatakon ko nirupit karne ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 British ecologist Arthur Tansley later refined the term, describing it as "the whole system 


 not only the organism complex, but also the whole complex of all the physical factors that we call the environment"
 tansle paaritantron ko na keval prakritik ikaiyaan ke rup main, balki "maansik isolats" ke rup main bhi maanate the
 Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope"
 paristhitiki tantra avadharana kaa mukhya vichaar yah he ki jivit jeev apane sthaneey parivesh main har duusare tatv ko prabhavit karaten hai
 Eugene Odum, a founder of Ecology said: "an entity that includes all organisms that affect the physical environment is that a flow of energy within the system is a clearly defined nutritional structure, biotic variation and material cycle an ecosystem
 " maanav paristhitiki tantra avadharana phir maanav / prakruti dvibhajan ke vyakhya par aadhaarit he or is aadhaar par he ki sabhi prajatiyaan ek duusare ke saath or unke biotope ke abiotic angeebhoot ke saath paristhitikta se ekikrut hai
 The biome is similar to an ecosystem in which a seasonally and geographically defined ecology refers to areas of similar climatic conditions, such as plants, animal communities, and soil organisms, often referred to as ecosystems
 bioms sanyantr sanrachanaon, patta prakaar, sanyantr antaralan or jalwaayu jaise karkon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Echoes are not defined on the basis of unequal, biome, classification, genetic or historical similarities

 The biodiversity conference, recognized by more than 175 countries, became particularly politically important after the "ecosystem, Conservation of Natural Habitats and Maintenance of Populations of Developable Species in the Natural Environment" by the commitment of the countries that approved the UN Environment Program As to identify spatial ecosystems from it and a political need has arisen for their distinction
 CBD "paristhitiki tantra" ko is prakaar paribhaashit karata he: "paudhe, jaanavar or sookshm jeev samudaayon kaa ek gatyatmakai parisar or unka nirjeev paryaavaran jo ek kaaryaatmak ikai ke rup main kaam karte hai

 The structure and meteorological elements of the respective vegetation, he said, are each modifiable determinants complemented by ecological data that partially separate distinct species
 yah na keval vanaspati prajatiyon ke liye sach he, balki pashuon kii prajatiyon, kavak or jeevanu ke liye bhi sach he
 The amount of detection of the ecosystem is subject to the physiognomic modifier that can be identified in an image and / or region
 jahaan aavashyak ho, vishesh pashuvarg tatwon ko joda ja saktaa he, jaise kii pashuon kii mausami sandratha or pravaal kii chattan kaa vitaran

 Stalinism is largely the set of policies adopted by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union to build a communist society
 rus main hui bolshevik kranti or uske netaa lenin kii mrityu ke baad teen dashakon main dhire-dhire ek raajnneetik parighatna ke rup main iskaa vikaas hua
 Since the life of Joseph Stalin, who was the head of the Soviet Communist Party between 1927 and 1956, some intellectuals had made a weak attempt to formulate a new ideology called marxism-leninism-stalinism
 isaki misaal disambar, 1934 ke pravada main prakashit karl radek ke ek lekh ke rup main milti he
 But this attitude was neither encouraged by Stalin nor other Soviet Communist Party theorists
 phir bhi is parighatna ke centre main maujuud stallin kii bauddhik or raajnneetik shakhsiyat ke kaaran ise stallinavaad kaa naam mil gaya
 This can be understood in two ways: as a project of building thirty years of socialism under the leadership of Stalin in the Soviet Union and ideological and organizational tendencies that emerged from this period which have given the Marxist politics all over the world Influenced as

 In this context, the Marxists of the whole world are divided into three parts: one is the one who fully accepts Stalinism and declares it as the main practical form of Marxism, the second part is the dismissive distortion of Marxist experiment by rejecting it completely
 And the third part is that which, despite considering the influence of Stalinism as generally persuasive and positive, some of its The criticism of Hluon

 In 1899, he became a professional revolutionary and started taking active participation in the Marxist movement
 kushal sanghathak or bhumigat raajnneetik kaam main maharath hone ke kaaran stallin ko krantikari halkon main pramukhataa milane lagi
 From 1904 onwards he united himself with Lenin and the Bolsheviks and in 1912 became a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee

 After Lenin's death in January 1924, he defeated Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Bukharin, opposing his policies one by one, and by the end of 1929 emerged as supreme leader of the Soviet party and state
 stallin kaa dehanth paanch march, 1953 ko hua
 Stalin's critics often present him only as a master of manipulations and a leader with modest intellectual abilities

 His theoretical writing was characterized by a very simple expression which made him well-liked among the workers
 stallin mukhya rup se vishwa-kranti ke bina hi ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant ke liye jane jate hai
 From 1924 onwards, Stalin wrote and analyzed writing to reinforce his argument

 This form of democracy seemed better and radical than the market-based liberal democracy that was developing in Western countries

 This party was in the hands of Lenin, who believed in the role of the party based on the dictatorship of the proletariat, democratic centralism and revolutionary avant-garde squad

 The civil war that took place between 1918–21, the two years that followed, and then the period between 1924–27 have historically given a contradictory name to ‘totalitarian democracy’

 In the following years, a number of institutional and ideological methods were invented in the name of combating the 'capitalist and imperialist siege' of the first socialist state by Western forces

 Criticizing the merits of the childish leftist, Lenin disagreed with the thesis of the continuing revolution promoted by Trotsky

 It was from the Tenth Congress in 1921 that the process of cleaning up the party started by expelling those who raised the voice of protest

 Stalin's contemporary Soviet theorist Nikolai Bukharin also endorsed the idea that socialism can be created in a country if the world's first socialist state could be guaranteed military security
 parjing kaa baar-baar istemaal karte hue stallin ne pandrahavin congress tak apni nitiyon ke virodhiyon se party ko mukt kar liya
 Appointment to every party post came into his hands and he set up special departments in regional party committees so that all types of appointments could be closely monitored

 The inclusion of names in this list meant that the person would be controlled by the party system, the party would remove, promote, or be marginalized at any time

 In 1971, British pharmacologist John Robert Wayne, who then worked at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed that aspirin reduced the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes
 is khoj ke liye unhen 1982 main physialaji or medicine, donon main nobel puraskaar diya gaya or nisehud se sammanit kiya gaya
 Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible neutralization of the cyclooxygenase enzyme
 cychlooxijnez kii aavashyaktaa prastaglandin or thrambaksen ke sanshleshan ke liye padati he
 Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent in place of the acetyl group attached to the serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme
 yah baat aspirin ko anya eneseidion se bhinn karti he, jo ki parivartaneey avarohak hote hai
 The use of long-term aspirin in small amounts irreversibly inhibits the production of thromboxane A2 in platelets, causing an inhibitory effect on platelet coagulation
 aspirin kaa yah skandan virdohi gun use hridayaghat kii ghatnaon ko kam karne main upyogi banaata he
 40 mg of aspirin per day can block a large proportion of maximal thromboxane A2 production without affecting the synthesis of prostaglandin I2
 lekin isse adhik avrodh ke liye aspirin kii adhik maatra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Prostaglandins are endemic hormones produced in the body and have various effects in the body, including sending pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation
 thrambaxenon kaa kaary plateleton kii jamaavat karnaa hota he jisase rakt ke thakke banate hai
 Heart attacks are primarily due to blood clots and low dose aspirin is useful for effective medical treatment of heart attacks
 iskaa mukhya dushprabhav yah he ki chunki rakt ke jamane kii kshamta kam ho jaati he, isaliye aspirin ke prayog se atyadhik rakt srav ho saktaa he
 There are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase - PTGS1 and PTGS2
 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits PTGS1 and modulates the enzymatic activity of PTGS2
 saamanytah pitijies2 prastenoidon kaa utpaadan karata he, jo adhikanshtah shothprerak hote hai
 Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, which are mostly anti-inflammatory
 amashyantreey dushprabhavon ko kam karne ke uddeshy se pitijies2 selective avarohak naamak nai eneidi dawaaon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he jo keval pitijies2 kaa avrodh karti hai
 However, many new ones such as Viacs have recently been withdrawn because there has been evidence that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack
 yah kaha gaya he ki sharir kii maheen raktanalikaaon kii bhitari parton main maujuud endothelial koshikaayen pitijies2 utpann karti hai or vishesh rup se pitijies2 kaa avrodh karne se prastaglandin ke utpaadan kaa thrambaksen ke mukaable downaregulation ho jaataa he, kyonki plateleton main pitijies1 aprabhavit rahete hai
 This removes the protective anticoagulant effect of PGI2, increasing the risk of thrombus and accompanying heart attacks and other hemorrhagic problems
 chunki plateleton main diene nahin hota he, ve ek baar aspirin dwaara anzime ko aparivartaneey rup se avaruddha kar dene ke baad nae pitijies kaa sanshleshan nahin kar sakate, jo ki aspirin kii parivartaneey avarodhakon kii tulana main mahatvapurn bhinnata he
 Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional mechanisms
 yah bhitari kala shunya se proton vaahak ke rup main mitrocandrial matrix, jahaan yah ek baar phir ynikrut hokar proton detii he, main waapas prasaarit hokar, cartillej ke mitocandria main oxykaarak phospharilation ko viyugalikrut karti he
 In short, aspirin transports the proteins by buffering them
 jab alpirin kii badi matraaen di jaati hai, to electron transport chen dwaara ooshmaa mukt kiye jane se aspirin vastav main fever utpann karti he, jabaki kam khuraaqon main aspirin bukhaar kam karti he
 In addition, aspirin promotes the formation of no-roots in the body, which have been shown to be independent mechanisms of reducing inflammation in mice
 yah shwet raktakanon ko aapas main chipakane se roktaa he, jo sankraman ke prati rakshaatmak pratikriya main mahatvapurn kadam he
