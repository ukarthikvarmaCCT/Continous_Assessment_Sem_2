 Comparative literature interpretation refers to the use of translation as a means of comparative study of literatures, so that fractions can be compared
 iske atirikt anya bhashaa sahitya kii kritiyon ke anuwaad kaa abhyaas karnaa athwa / or unhen anudit rup main padhanaa tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan main anuwaad ke yogadan kaa udhaaharan he
 The translation business, as practicable, appears in many fields
 koshkarya bhi uk prakaar kaa anuwaad kaary he
 a bilingual dictionary contains translation within a single language and a bilingual dictionary between two languages
 yah anuwaad, paath kii apeksha bhashaa ke aayam par hota he, jisamen bhashaa vishleshan ke do str prabhavit hote hai
 They are two levels - word and word series
 isi prakaar kisi bhashaa ke vikaas ke liye bhi anuwaad-vyapaar kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 When a language has an opportunity to work in areas that were not previously used, it needs to be developed from both a content and a method of expression
 iske liye anya bhashaaon se vibhinn prakaar ke sahitya kaa usamen anuwaad kiya jaataa he
 Consequently, with the expansion of the perimeter of the content, the area of the lexicon of the language also expands
 anek naye shabd ban jate hai, kai baar prachlit shabdon ko nayaa arth mil jaataa he, naye sahprayog viksit hone lagate hai, sankar-shabdaawalee prayog main aane lagati he, or bhashaa prayog ke sandarbh kii visheshta ke kaaran kul milakar bhashaa kaa ek naveen bhed viksit ho jaataa he
 Modern administrative Hindi and journalistic Hindi are good examples of this
 is prakriya ko bhashaa niyojan or bhashaa vikaas kehete hai, jo apane vyapaktar sandarbh main raashtra ke saamaajik-aarthik vikaas kaa ang he
 Thus through translation, necessary and important literature enters the developing language
 tab kah sakate hai ki is rup main anuwaad rashtriya vikaas main bhi yogadan karata he
 Translation in its widest form enhances the power of language, helps in the interpretation and interpretation of texts, clarifies the relationship between language and thought, propagates knowledge, is a conduit of culture, and mutual degradation between nations
 And contributes to the growth of harmony
 gete ke shabdon main, anuwaad asambhav hote hue bhi aavashyak tathaa mahatvapurn he
 There are two notable aspects of the nature of translation - coordination and balance
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa bahuvidyaparak aayam iskaa samanvayshil paksh he
 Accordingly, although the basic origin of translation theory is applied comparative textology, yet some other scriptures touch upon it
 'tulanaatmak' se anuwaad kaa do bhashaaon se sambandhit hona spasht hi he, jisamen bhashaaon kii samanta-asamanta ke prashn upasthit hote hai
 The three aspects of textual science - semantics, syntax and contextualism - are relevant to translation theory
 arthvichaar main bhashik sanket tathaa bhashaabahya yatharth ke bich main sambandh kaa adhyayan hota he
 The status of linguistics under contextualism refers to the various dimensions of the context - the social identity of the speaker and the listener, the purpose of linguistics and the speaker towards the message - the attitude of the listener, the physical conditions of linguistics and the expression, medium, etc
 spasht he ki sanketavigyaan kii paridhi bhashavigyaan kii apeksha vyapaktar he tathaa anuwaad kaary jaise vyapak sampreshan vyapaar ke adhyayan ke upyukt he
 The scripture that touches the translation principle is the communication principle, according to which the translation work is a communication business, and accordingly all the things that apply to it are in the nature of communication business, such as 100% of the communication is not true, imperfection , Ecstasy, partial artificiality etc
 isi se anuwaad kaary main shabd-prati-shabd tathaa arth-prati-arth samanta ke sthaan par sandesstareey samanta kaa auchity bhi saadhaa ja saktaa he
 From a operational point of view, a text or speech is the starting point of translation work
 ek paath kii apni sanrachana hoti he, bhashik sansakti tathaa sandesgat subaddhata kii sankalpanaaon dwaara uske sugathit athwa shithil hone kii jaanch kar sakate hai
 In addition, considering a text as a unified whole of linguistics, it provides more definite information about the linguistic functional distribution of language-use styles
 isi se sambandhit shaastra he, samajabhashashastra tathaa shailivigyaan, jisamen saamaajik boliyon tathaa prayuktiyon ke adhyayan ke saath sandarbhanukool bhashaprayog kii shailion ke vitaran kii jaankaree anuwaad siddhanth ke liye vaanchhneeya he
 Being connected to the language, logic and linguistics also confirm the translation principle
 tarkshastra ke anusaar anudit paath ke satyamulya kii pariksha anuwaad kii vishuddhta ko shuddh karne kaa aadhaar he
 Meaningful thinking in linguistics helps in understanding problems related to the transfer or repetition of meaning in translation work
 vitgenstin kii manyata 'bhashaa main shabd kaa 'prayog' hi uskaa arth he'
 The translation theory is particularly relevant for the reason that the text itself is the unit of translation work, which is the first requirement for successful semantic translation
 is prakaar vaktaa kii vivaksha main arth kaa mul khojna, bhashik arth tathaa bhashaabahya sthiti anuwaad siddhanth ke aavashyak ang hai
 While the above assumptions have a role in the transfer of meaning, the special utility of the method of subtractive analysis has been accepted in the determination of semantic bilingual equality
 yah baat vishesh rup se dhyaan main lee jaati he ki jahaan vividh shastron kii praasangik manyataon se anuwaad siddhanth kaa swaroop nirmit he, vahaan swayan anuwaad siddhanth un shastron kaa ek vishisht ang he
 Translation is also the 'general' aspect of the theory and also the specific aspect, and it is its equilibrium form - the balance of the general and the specific
 anuwaad kii paribhaasha ke anusaar kaha jaataa he ki anuwaad vyavahaaratah vishisht bhashabhed ke str par tathaa isiilie siddhantatah saamaanya bhashaa ke str par hota he - angreji bhashaa ke ek bhed patrakarita kii angreji se hindi bhashaa ke samamoolya bhed patrakarita kii hindi main
 Accordingly, translation is both a general aspect and a specific aspect of translation theory
 ham jo baat saamaanya ke str par kehete hai, use vyaavhaarik rup main bhashabhed ke vishisht str par udaahrit karte hai
 'determining a suitable and common translation system for as many text types as possible' is considered a pertinent question in the field of translation
 pranali ke nirdhaaran ke sambandh main anuwaad prakriya kii prakruti, anuwaad ke vibhinn prakaar, anuwaad ke sutara tathaa vibhinn koti ke paathon ke anuwaad ke nirdesh nishchit karne ke praaroop kaa nirdhaaran, aadi par vichaar karnaa hota he
 The main purpose of translation, unit of translation, nature of art-skills of translation, limitations of translation work, etc
 are some other subjects, which require consideration
 anuwaad kaary kaa merudand he mulbhasha paath
 Theoretical discussion and determination of its operational structure in relation to its structure, its type, the format of the text according to the linguistic format, etc
, along with semantics and various formats of analytical comprehension of grammatical structure, assessment of their strengths and limitations, etc
 , Are the main points under it
 anuwaad siddhanth ke hi antargat kuch gaun binduon kii charchaa bhi hoti he - roopak, vyaktivaachak sangyaayen, paribhaashik shabd, adyakshar shabd, bhugolic naam, vyapaarik naam, vyavsaayik pratishthanon ke naam, saanskrithik shabd, aadi ke anuwaad ke liye koun-si pranali apanaai jaae; saahitiyik rachanaaon, vaigyanik or praudyogikeey lekhan, prachaar sahitya aadi ke liye anuwaad pranali kaa rup kya ho, ityadi
 There is an important point related to this, various tips of translation - transliteration, word-to-word translation, concordant translation, input translation, interpretation, elaboration, interpretation, cultural synonym, interpreting, etc
 anuwaad kaa kaam antatogatva ek hi vyakti karata he
 In solitary translation, the translator is alone, even in collaborative translation, in the last period, the work of editing is done by the translator alone
 atah anuvadak ke saath anek daayitv jud jate hai or kaary ke safal nishpaadan main usase anek apekshaayen rahati hai
 In terms of language knowledge, subject knowledge, expression skills, personal qualities, etc
, the expectations from the translator have to be considered
 anuwaad shiksha or anuwaad samiksha, do anya mahatvapurn bindu hai
 Translation education can be imparted as a means of language-learning, especially other language learning
 isamen anuwaad shikshan, bhashaa-shikshan ke adheen he tathaa ek madhyavarti alpakaalik abhyaskram main isaki yojana kii jaati he, jisamen shikshan ke sopan tathaa lakshya bindu spasht tathaa nishchit hote hai
 The learner's goal in this is to learn the language, not to translate
 shiksha ke duusare charan main anuwaad kaa abhyaas, anuwaad ko ek shilp yaa kaushal ke rup main seekhney ke liye kiya jaataa he, jisaki pragat avasthaa 'anuwaad kala he' kii shabdaawalee main nirdisht kii jaati he
 In this case, the language which is not the translator's own, also confirms his learning in a casual way
 abhyaas saamagree ke rup main paath prakaaron kii vividhta tathaa kathinaayee kii maatra ke anusaar paathon kaa anustaran karnaa hota he
 If there is an aim to develop the ability to translate a homogeneous / heterogeneous, indigenous or foreign language into or from a scheme of learning, then both steps of translation-learning - both instrumental and practicable - can be seen as unconstrained
 anuwaad samiksha, anuwaad siddhanth kaa aisa ang he, jiskaa shithil rup main vyavhaar, anudit kriti kaa ek saamaanya pathak bhi karata he, parantu jisaki ek paryaapt spasht saiddhanthik prishthbhumi he
 Theoretical translation review is a cognitive tradeoff
 isamen ek mulpath ke ek yaa ek se adhik anuwaadon kii samiksha kii jaati he, tathaa mul kii tulana main anuwaad kaa yaa mul ke vibhinn anuwaadon kaa parsparik tulana dwaara moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 It has three steps - an analysis of both the original language text and the target language text, a comparison of the two, and finally the evaluation of translation in terms of target language accuracy, appropriateness and naturalness
 moolankan ke sopan par anuwaad kii safalataa kii jaanch ke liye vibhinn pareekshan takneekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The mindset of accepting translation as both an art and a science has grown due to the fact that attempts at mutual translation of languages around the world point to many styles and methods of translation
 anuwaad kii ek bhangima to yahi he ki kisi rachana kaa saahitiyik-vidha ke aadhaar par anuwaad upasthit kiya jaae
 If a play is to be translated as a play, then in such translations, the translator's own creative talent is also required
 anuwaad kaa ek aadhaar anuwaad ke gadyatmak athwa padyatmak hone par bhi ashrith he
 It is found that most of the translation of prose is present in prose or verse itself, but sometimes this sequence seems to have changed
 kai gadhy kritiyon ke padyanuwaad milte hai, to kai kavyakritiyon ke gadyanuwaad bhi uplabdh hai
 Translations are also categorized on the basis of subject and on many levels it is also divided into two categories, original-focused and original-free, depending on the nature of the translation
 anuwaad ke jin sarthak or prachlit prabhedon kaa ullekh anuwaad vigyaniyon ne kiya he, unamem shabdanuwaad, bhavanuaad, chhayanuwaad, saranuwaad, vyakhyanuwaad, ashyanuwaad or roopantaran ko sarvaadhik sweekruti mili he
 The translation of every word of the source language into every word in the target language is called transliteration
 'makshika sthane makshika' par aadhaarit shabdanuwaad vastav main anuwaad kii sabase nikrusht koti kaa parichaayak hota he
 The nature of each language is different from other language and in every language there are many meanings of the word
 isiilie mul bhashaa kii har shabdabhivyakti ko yathavat lakshyabhasha main nahin anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa
 Sometimes such ridiculous situations arise
 sanskrit se hindi main kiye gayi anuwaad ko kai baar prakruti kii samyata ke kaaran sahya hote hai, lekin europea parivaar kii bhashaaon se kiye gaye anuwaad main arth or padakram ke dosha saamanytah najar aate hai
 In fact, if the source and the target language are similar in meaning, use, syntax, and style, then only eloquence is correct, otherwise the mechanized eloquence becomes ludicrous, funny and artificial
 aise anuvaadakon main strot-bhashaa ke shabd, padakram or vaakya-vinyas par dhyaan na dekar anuwaad mulbhasha kii vichaar-saamagree yaa bhavadhaara par apane aapako kendrit karata he
 The goal of the translator is to present the contents of the source language in such translations
 bhavanuaad kii prakriya main kabhi-kabhi mul rachana jaisaa moulik vaibhav aa jaataa he, lekin kai baar pathakon ko yah shikaayat hoti he ki anuvadak ne mulbhasha kii bhavadhaara ko samajhe bina, lakshya-bhashaa kii prakruti ke anuroop bhav saamagree prastut kar di he
 When a reader wants to read a work from the point of view of the expression skills of the creator, then paraphrasing is not helpful in its goal achievement
 sanskrit naatakon main lagaataar aise prayog milte hai ki unki stra-paatra tathaa sevak, daasi aadi jis praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai, uski sanskrit chaaya bhi naatak main vidyaman rahati he
 Chhayanuvaad has emerged from similar experiments
 anuwaad kii pravidhi ke antargat anuvadak na shabdanuwaad kii tarah keval mul shabdon kaa anusaran karata he or na sirf bhaavon kaa hi paripaalan karata he, balki mulbhasha se puri tarah bandhaa hua uski chaaya main lakshyabhasha main varnya-vishay kii prastuti karata he
 In this translation, the contents of the original language are abbreviated and shortened to the target language
 lambey bhaashanon or vaad-vivaadon ke anuwaad prastut karne main yah vidhi sahaayak hoti he
 In such translations, translation of the contents of the original language along with the interpretation in the target language is introduced
 isamen anuvadak apane adhyayan or dashshtikon ke anuroop mul bhashaa kii saamagree kii vyakhya apekshit pramaanon or udaahranon aadi ke saath karata he
 Lokmanya Tilak has translated 'geeta' in this style
 sanskrit ke bahut saare bhashyakaron or hindi ke tikaakaron ne vyakhyanuwaad kii style kaa hi anugaman kiya he
 By nature, linguism or linguism becomes much larger than the original and at many levels becomes absolutely fundamental
 jahaan anuwaad dubhashiye kii bhoomika main kaam karata he, vahaan vah keval ashyanuwaad kar paata he
 Interpreters become a medium of communication between the different languages of the two remote countries when they talk among themselves
 aise avasaron par ve anuwaad shabd or bhav kii simaaon ko todakar anuvadak kii satvar anuwaad kshamta par aadhaarit ho jaataa he
 He does not have enough time to think about the correct linguistic synonym of the word or to seek the help of the dictionary
 kai baar aise dubhashiye ke ashyanuwaad ke kaaran do deshon main tanaav kii sthiti bhi ban jaati he
 Short translation is now known as interpretation
 anuwaad ke is prabhed main anuvadak mulbhasha se lakshyabhasha main keval shabd or bhav kaa anuvaadan nahin karata, apitu apni pratibha or suvidha ke anusaar mul rachana kaa puri tarah roopantaran kar daalata he
 William Shakespeare's famous play 'merchant of Venice' has been translated by Bharatendu Harishchandra as 'rare Bandhu' meaning 'mahajan of Vanshipur', which is the best example of translation
 mul naatak ke antonio, basolio, porshia, shylock jaise naamon ko bhaaratendu ne kramshah anant, basant, purashri, shailaksh jaise roopaantar pradaan kiye hai
 The originality of translation emerges most in such a conversion
 anuvadak ke in prabhedon se gyaapit hota he ki sansar bhar kii bhashaaon main anuwaad kii kai sheliyaan or pravidhiyaan apanaai gai hai, lekin yadi anuvadak saavdhaneepurvak shabd or bhav kii aatma kaa sparsh karte hue mulbhasha kii prakruti ke anuroop lakshyabhasha main anuwaad upasthit kare to yahi adarsh anuwaad hoga
 That is why the best translator is said to be such a skilled doctor, who delivers the medicine kept in the bottle as it is in the patient's body through his syringe
 anuwaad siddhanth koi apane main swatantra, swanishtha, siddhanth nahin he or na hi yah us arth main koi ‘vigyaan' hi he, jis arth main ganitshastra, bhashashastra, samajashaastra aadi hai
 It also does not have any specific study material and study system, which is different from the study material and system of other scriptures in such a way that it can basically become an independent personality
 vastutah, yah anuwaad ke vibhinn muddon se sambandhit gyanatmak soochnaaon kaa ek nikaay he, jisase anuwaad ko ek prakriya, ek nishpatti, tathaa ek sambandh ke rup main samajhane main sahaayta milti he
 For this, the words 'translation science', 'translation science', and 'translation science' are also popular
 anuwaad, bhashaprayog sambandhi ek aisi prakriya he, jisaki ek sunishchit parinti hoti he tathaa jiske falswaroop mul evam nishpatti main 'mulya' kii drushti se samanta kaa sambandh sthapit ho jaataa he
 Thus, information about the general nature of translation as the integrated unit of process, execution, and relationship is the translation principle, which, despite not being originally collected, is collectible, interesting, informative, and to a lesser extent real for the translation work
 apane vikaas kii vartmaan avasthaa main yah bahu-vidyaparak anushaasan ban gaya he
 Whose knowledge is itself a goal and which is a source of intellectual satisfaction for the curious reader
 anuwaad siddhanth kii anuwaad kaary main upyogita kaa akalan ke samay is samayik tathy ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he ki vartmaan kaal main anuwaad ek sangathit vyavsaay ho gaya he, jisamen vyaktigat ruchi kii apeksha vyavsaayik-saamaajik aavashyaktaa se prerit prashikshanarthiyon kii sankhya adhik hoti he 
 The contribution of translation theory is demonstrated in developing proficiency in translation work especially for such people and for interested translators in general
 is yogadan kaa saiddhanthik auchity is drushti se bhi he ki anuwaad kaary sarjanaatmak hone ke kaaran hi gaun rup se samikshatmak bhi hota he 
 It is also called 'creative-critical'
 sarjanaatmakataa ko vishuddh tathaa pusht karne ke liye jo samikshatmak sphuranaayen anuvadak main hoti hai, ve anuwaad siddhanth ke gyaan se prarit hoti hai 
 Principle knowledge contributes to the accuracy of translation accuracy
 saath hi, anuwaad prakriya kii jaankaree use paryaay-chayan main adhik saavdhaanee se kaam karne main sahaayta kar sakati he 
 It is considered more important that he can avoid making silly errors
 mulpath kaa bhashik, vishyavastugat, tathaa saanskrithik mahatva kaa koi ansh anudit hone se na rah jaae, iske liye apekshit satark drushti ko viksit karne main bhi anuwaad siddhanth kaa gyaan anuvadak kii sahaayta karata he 
 The same question is also seen from the other end
 kaha jaataa he ki jo log moulik likh sakate hai, ve likhte hai, jo likh nahin pate ve anuwaad karte hai, or jo log anuwaad nahin kar sakate, ve anuwaad ke bare main charchaa kiya karte hai 
 In fact, these three are complementary - all three are different - however it is believed that the translation theory experience helps the student of translation theory to make the translation discussion more authentic and vivid
 yah baat kuch aisa hi he ki sarjanaatmakataa se anubhav ke str par parichit sahitya sameekshak apni samikshatmak pratikriyaaon ko adhik vishvasotpadak reeti se prastut kar saktaa he
 Looking at the current form of translation theory, its development is seen by dividing it into two stages from the vivid view: aadhunik bhashavigyaan, vishesh rup se anuprayukt bhashavigyaan, ke vikaas se purv kaa yug-beesvin sadi purvardh; Later era - late twentieth century
 saamaanya rup se kaha jaataa he ki, siddhanth vikaas ke vibhinn yugon main or usee vibhinn dhaaraon main vivaad kaa vishay yah rahaa ki, anuwaad shabdanugami ho yaa arthanugami, yadhyapi vivaad kii 'bhashaa' badalati rahi 
 BCE begins in the first century from the Roman era, when Horrens and Cicero distinguished the word for vowel and semantic translation and gave priority to the semantic translation for literary works
 siciro ne achche anuvadak ko vyakhyaakaar tathaa alankaar prayog main daksh bataaya 
 After the Roman era, which dominated literary translations, the second powerful section is the Bible translation
 sant jerome ne bhi bible ke anuwaad main arthanugamita ko pradhanta di tathaa anuwaad main dainandin ke vyavhaar kii bhashaa ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 The idea in this was that the message of the Bible should reach the masses and for this reason, the language of comprehension should be used for the masses, in which the economical approach by nature predominated
 jaan vicliff tathaa wiliam tindl ne is pravriti kaa samarthan kiya
 The propensity to translate the Bible was encouraged, in which Martin Luther's contribution was remarkable, in the language of comprehension and beauty, and protecting the harmony between style and meaning
 tritiy dhara shikshakram main anuwaad ke yogadan se sambandhit rahi he
 Quitilian saw the utility of translation and bilingual lexical translation in the context of developing writing practice and speech-skills
 jiskaa madhyakaalin europe main adhik prasar hua 
 This raised the level of local languages and also increased their expressive power
 samrudh or viksit bhashaaon se vikasshil bhashaaon main anuwaad kii pravriti madhyakaalin europe ke saahitiyik jagat kii ek pramukh pravriti he, jise urdhvastari aayam kii pravriti kaha gaya or isi samay prachlit samaan rup se viksit yaa aviksit bhashaaon ke madhya anuwaad kii pravriti ko samastari aayam kii pravriti ke rup main dekha gaya
 Among the early theories of medieval Europe, the French scholar E
 Dolet proposed five prohibitions of translation in the essay published in 1540: anuvadak ko mul lekhak kii bhashaa kii puraa gyaan ho, parantu vah chaahe to mulbhasha kii durbodhata or aspashtataa ko dur kar saktaa he
 The translator has complete knowledge of the native language and the target language; anuvadak shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad se bache; Use the language of translator Dainandin's practice; anuvadak aisa shabdachayan tathaa shabdavinyas kare ki uchit prabhaav kii nishpatti ho
 George Chapman likewise proposed three sources of translation with reference to the 'iliad': shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad se bachaa jaae; Try to reach the spirit of the original; anuwaad, vidvatta ke sparsh ke kaaran ati shithil na ho 
 The stream of translation was a secondary trend in the Renaissance era of Europe
 is yug ke anuvaadakon main arth kii pradhanta ke saath pathak ke hiton kii raksha kii pravriti dikhaai detii he 
 In the translation of the Netherlands, the meaning of the text is reflected in the rite of the translated text by the addition and modification
 satrahavin shatabdi main england main sar jaan denham ne kavita ke anuwaad main shabdanugami hone kii pravriti kaa virodh kiya or mul paath ke kendriya tatva ko grahan kar lakshyabhasha main uske punassarjan kii baat kahi; use 'anusarjan' kaha jane laga
 In this period, John Dryden revealed important ideas
 unhone anuwaad kaary kii teen kotiyaan nirdhaarit kii : Word-per-word translation; arthanugami anuwaad, Simulation
 dryden ke anusaar or ke madhya kaa maarg avlamban yogya he 
 According to him, in translating poetry, the translator should have authority over both languages, have knowledge of the literary qualities of the original author and his 'spirit', and follow the literary ideals of his time
 aleggender pope ne bhi dyden ke samaan hi vichaar prakat kiye 
 The problem of the translator's duty to his contemporary readers was a step further from the controversy over the superstition and hyper-freedom of translation in the eighteenth century
 pathak kii ore atyadhik jhukaav ke kaaran anudit paath kaa swaroop mul paath se kaaphi dur pad jaataa tha
 To this, Dr
 Samuel Johnson said that, in translation, the culmination due to additions rather than the text can be welcomed, but attention should be paid to the loss of the text
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jis prakaar lekhak apane samakaleen pathak ke liye likhata he, usee prakaar anuvadak bhi apane samakaleen pathak ke liye anuwaad karata he 
 In Dr
 Jansan's opinion, there is a balance between the basicity of the translation and the readership
 unhone anuvadak ko aisa chitrakaar yaa anukarta kaha jo mul ke prati nishthavan hote hue bhi uddisht darshak ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhata he 
 Alexander Fraser Tittler, whose book Principles of Translation is considered the first systematic book on translation theory
 titaler ne teen anuwaad sutara prastaavit kiye : The translation should have full maintenance of the sentiment of the original composition; anuwaad kii style mul ke anuroop ho; Translations should have original comprehension
 titaler ne hi yah kaha ki, anuwaad main mul kii bhaavana is prakaar purnataya sashakrant ho jaae ki use padhkar pathakon ko utani hi teevr anubhuti ho, jitani mul ke pathakon ko hui thi; prabhavasmata kaa siddhanth yahi he 
 The influence of erstwhile poetrymaking on translation thinking in the romantic and post-romantic eras in the nineteenth century is visible
 e0 dablyoo0 shlegal ne sab prakaar ke maukhik evam likhit bhashaa vyavhaar ko anuwaad kii sangya di, tathaa mul ke gathan ko sangrakshit rakhane par bal diya 
 In this age, on the one hand, there is a tendency for the translator to think like a creative writer, on the other hand, it was said that the translation should be emphasized to make it translatable
 kuch vidwaanon ne anuwaad kii bhinn upbhasha hone kaa charchaa kii jo uparyukt manyataon se mail khaati he
 The translators of the Victorian Section have been striving to preserve the distance between country and time in translation - foreignness and antiquity are not lost in the translation of ancient works of foreign languages - which in turn encouraged the trend of vernacular translation
 laungphelo iske samarthak the 
 But Fitzgerald, the translator of Omar Khayyam's rubies, had the opposite view
 ve is manyata ke samarthak the ki, anuwaad ke pathak ko mul bhashaa paath ke nikat laane ke sthaan par mulbhasha paath kii saanskrithik visheshtaon ko lakshyabhasha main is prakaar prastut kiya jaae ki, vah lakshyabhasha kaa apni sajiv sampatti prathit ho, tathaa is prakriya main mulbhasha se anuwaad kii badhi hui duuri kii upeksha kar di jaae 
 Two-three translation thinkers are notable in the first half of the twentieth century
 kroche tathaa velri ne anuwaad kii safalataa, vishesh rup se kavita ke anuwaad kii safalataa, main sandeh vyakt kiye hai
 Matthew Arnold emphasized the adoption of a simple, direct and lofty style in the translation of Homer's works
 is prakaar aadhunik bhashavigyaan ke udai se purv kii avadhi main anuwaad chintan praayah do virodhatmak manyataon ke chaaron ore ghumta rahaa
 Those two beliefs are as follows - anuwaad shabdanugami ho yaa swatantra ho, Translation is impossible from the point of view of its inner nature, but very important from the social point of view
 is avadhi ke anuwaad chintan main kul milakar sanghatnatmak tathaa vibhedatmak drushtiyon kaa santulan dekha jaataa rahaa - sanghatnatmak drushti se anuwaad siddhanth kaa aisa swaroop abhipret he jo saamaanya koti kaa ho, tathaa vibhedatmak drushti main paathon kii prakrutigat vibhinnata ke aadhaar par anuwaad kii pranali main aavashyak parivartan kii charchaa kaa antarbhaav he 
 The scholars pondered abstraction during this period, but they could not think of a translation system
 mulpath ke antargyanamoolak bodhan se ve vishleshnatmak bodhan ke lakshya kii ore to bade parantu uske peeche sunishchit siddhanth kii bhoomika nahin rahi
 Apart from translators, among these thinkers, there were more litterateurs and literature reviewers, not linguists
 iske atirikt ve ek-duusare ke chintan se parichit hon, aisa bhi prathit nahin hota tha
 Although modern linguistics emerged in the first half of the twentieth century, the latter period is important in terms of the relevance of translation theory
 is avadhi main bhashavigyaan se parichit anuvaadakon tathaa bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan anuwaad siddhanth kii ore aakrisht hua 
 The development of structural linguistics, the advancement of semantics, the coordination of communication theory and linguistics, and the development of various branches of applied linguistics - sociolinguistics, stylology, psychodynamics, propensity analysis - and the rise of semiotics, especially text signaling, are considered such phenomena, Which is important in terms of confirming and developing the translation theory It was considered angl-amareeki dhara main ek vidvan uzen naida bhi maane jate hai
 On the basis of Bible-translation experience, he gave his views on translation theory and practice as texts
 inamen anuwaad siddhanth kaa vistrut, vishad tathaa tarksangat rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 Describing the translation process, Nida presented a definite linguistic principle for the analysis of the original language text and laid down various dimensions for restructuring the message in the target language
 unhone anuwaad kii sthiti se sambaddh donon bhashaaon ke bich vividhstareey samyojanon kaa vivaran prastut kiya 
 Other scholars are Catford, whose translation theory exemplifies the application of structural linguistics
 unhone shuddh bhashavaigyanik aadhaar par anuwaad ke praroopo kaa nirdhaaran kiya, anuwaad-parivritti kaa bhashavaigyanik vivaran diya, tathaa anuwaad kii simaaon par vichaar kiya 
 The third influential scholar is Peter Numark, who attempted to present a logical and thorough discussion of translation theory in a structured and intimate style

 So if humans ever make a taryan, then they need to invent new techniques whose speed will be much higher than the Voyager first

 adhikansh colors ne unki yachika kaa paalan kiya or sharaab vyapaar chhod diya
 Although this community is known for their ancestral occupation, they have a reputation for non-drinkers
 The community's name is derived from the Sanskrit word Kalyapala, which means liquor distillers; From ancient times until the British period, artisans were mainly engaged in making fermented liquor in small pot-stills

 Many people would have accepted this profession for commercial gain, as there are forty sub-castes in the arts; Probably due to these reasons, in the old definition, it was called a hybrid

 phir yantric anuwaad par atararashtriya sammelan hone lage, patrapatrikas nikaleen ore roosi se angreji main anuwaad hone lage
 The main methods of mechanical translation are: niyamadhaarit masini anuwaad is aadhaar par kaam karata he ki bhashaaen kaaphi kam mul niyamon ke aadhaar par kaam karatin hai; isse kuch adhik inke apwaad hote hai; or inkaa ek shabdkosh hota he
 The benefit of machine translation is well known when we translate from a language and script whose one letter is not understood
 jab anuwaad karne par vah 'kuch arth dene' lagata he tab masini anuwaad kaa mahatv kaa anubhav hota he
 This opens a very large window
 jab manushya badi mehnat se bhashaa seekhney ke baad bhi sahi tarah se bolne main galati karata hi to masini anuwaad kaa majaak udaane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 Many thinkers believe that machine translation has reached this level and is progressing at such a pace that there will no longer be the basis of the need for a 'universal language' for global thought exchange
 masini anuwaad bhinn-bhinn maatrubhaasha vaale logon ke bich sethu kaa kaary karegaa
 If the quality of machine translation improves slightly, the number of learners of English as a foreign language will decrease

 It was published serially in the magazine 'peus Pravah' between 1884-88
 ‘aashcharyavrittant’ vishuddh rup se vigyaan galp tha jo tilsmi or jasusi prabhaavon se sarvatha unmukt tha
 On the other hand, in the Bengali language "panch Kauri De", when detective literature - 'incident-umbrella', 'jai-parajaya', 'jeevan Rahasya', 'neel Vasna Sundari', 'mayavi', '- were trending in the same period
 Science fiction was also being written in it, rather it should be said that the science fiction in Bangla had preceded it
 paudhon main jivan ke vishleshak or betaar ke avishkaarak acharya jagadish chandra bose ne ‘tufaan par vijay’ sheershak se pratham bangla vigyaan galp 1897 main hi likhaa tha
 Anadidhan Bannerji presented novels like 'van Kusum', 'champa Phool', 'chor' as well as science fiction like 'mars'

 Khanni Praneet 'narendramohini' 'virendra Veer', 'chandrakanta Santi', 'kusum Kumari', 'naulakha Haar', 'guptagodna'
 The 'paper closet', the unique Begum, 'bhootnath' crossed all limits of popularity
 devaki nandan khatri ke indrajaal kaa jaadu pathakon ke sir par chadhakar bolne laga
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has written in 'history of Hindi Literature' that Urdu speakers learned Hindi to enjoy Khatri's Tilasmi literature
 to aisa tha khatri kaa andrajalik sansar ! What is the reader, even contemporary writers could not live without being enthralled by this magic
 phir tilsmi sahitya rachane ke sarthak prayaas aarambh hue or prabhoot maatra main aisi chijen saamne aane lageen or hindi pathak usamen sarabor ho gaya
 The rich tradition of such writers is seen in this period
 devi prasad upaadhyaay krit ‘maaya-vilaas’, jagannatha chaturvedi krit ‘vasant-malti’, hare krishna johar krit ‘kusum lata’, ‘bhayanak prem’, saraswati gupta krit ‘rajkumaar’, bal mukund verma krit ‘kamini’, rajendra mohini, hare krishna johar krit ‘nari-pishaach’, ‘manyak-mohini’, ‘jaadugar’ tathaa ‘camel kumari’, madan mohan pathak krit ‘anand sundari’, munni laal khanni krit ‘sachcha bahadur’, hare krishna johar krit ‘niraala nakaabposh’ tathaa ‘bhayanak khun’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘kate mud kii do-do baaten’, vishweshwar prasad verma krit, ‘virendra kumaar’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘yakuti takhti’, ram laal verma krit ‘putalimahal’, rup kishor jain krit ‘surya kumaar sambhav’ aadi isi sahitya kii pratinidh rachanaaen hai
 This tradition continued in the future, but it is from here that tilasmi literature should often be considered as an end
 yah bhi ek vicitra sanyog he ki tilsmi sahitya ke saath-saath jasusi kii bhi achaanak baadh aa gayi or bhi pathakon ne saraahaa or apanaaya
 The detective novels in Hindi are Preeta Gopal Ram Gahmari
 devaki nandan khatri kii ‘chandrakanta’ or ‘narendra mohini’ ke thode samyantaral baad ‘adbhut laash’ or ‘guptchar’ ke saath gahamri bhi udit hue
 Inspired by the growing popularity of these detective novels, Gahmari created such a plethora of literature - 'baekasoor ki hanga', 'sarkati corpse', 'who is the murderer?', 'blood of innocent', 'blood of Jamuna', 'double 'spies', 'mayawini', 'sorceress Manorama' 1901), 'girl Chori', 'spy Ki Bhool', 'police Station's theft', 'robbery theft', 'blind eye', 'trap King', 'fake Kaka' , 'detective Theft,' 'theft in Warehouse', 'robbery on Robbery', 'doctor's Story', 'piercing the House', 'detective Detective ',' Devi Singh '
 'boy missing', 'detective Chakkar', 'killer's distinction', 'bhojpur's thief'
 'balihari wisdom', 'yoga glory' and 'guptabhed' etc
 jasusi sahitya ke prabhaav se samakaleen hindi lekhak bhi apane ko virat na rakh sake or isi avadhi main aisi anekanek rachanaaen saamne ai

 lekin yaheen se yah parampara samaptpraaya he
 The reason is that this tradition was new in Hindi and completely influenced by Anglo literature
 bhartiya vaataavaran ke anuroop na hone ke kaaran pathak jaldi isse ub gaya
 The anorexia of the readers also made tilasmi, ayari and espionage literature in abeyance itself
 premchand ke avataran ke saath hi chitrapat puri tarah parivartit ho chukaa tha
 Tilasmi and espionage literature went into the background around 1917-18

 While writing about Hindi science fiction, people often refer to Keshav Prasad Singh's 'chandralok Ki Yatra' as the first science fiction
 abhi tak aisa hi abhimath he
 Perhaps the reason for this is the commentary of Pt
 Srinarayan Chaturvedi that he gave at the beginning of the story section of 'diamond Jubilee special issue' published to commemorate 60 years of 'saraswati' magazine
 ‘saraswati’ ke bhaag 1, sankhya 6, main pahili baar do kahaniyaan ek saath prakashit hui
 Kishori Lal Goswami's 'indumati' and Keshav Prasad Singh's 'travel to Chandralok'
 chaturvedi ji in par tippanee karte hai-duusari kahani kisi angreji kahani ke aadhaar par likhi hui maaloom hoti he
 She is tall and was published serially
 ‘indumati’ saraswati hi main nahin, hindi main aadhunik style kii pratham kahani he
 ' ‘chandralok kii yatra’ ko to unhone angl-aadhrut kahkar mahatvaheen kar diya lekin ‘indumati’ ko pahili hindi kahani ghoshit kiya
 'earlier' Harishchandra Chandrika 'and' Piyush Pravah 'had one or two stories
 pan ambika dutt vyas kii ‘aashcharya-vrittant’ naam kii or pan bal krishna bhatta kii ‘nutan brahychari’ naamak kahaniyaan sambhawatah iske pahile kii prakashit ho chuki thim
 But 'indumati' is credited with being the first modern story of Hindi
 ’ Probably he ended his talk by saying, but if there had been an attempt to investigate it, then the confusion would have ended which is the first Hindi science fiction? Although this discussion continues in Hindi, which is the first modern story of Hindi

 Overwhelmed by his poetic brilliance, Bharatendu while publishing his poem in the 'kavibhaka Sudha' commented - 'the wisdom of this remarkable child is also unique and the state is only twelve years old

 inaki pramukh rachanaayen nimnavat hai: The saltwater crocodile or estuarine crocodile is the largest living reptile
 yah uttari australia, bharat ke purvi tat or dakshin-purvi asia ke upyukt awaas sthanon main paaya jaataa he
 The snout of a saltwater crocodile is longer than that of a crocodile called a crocodile: its length at the base is twice the width
 anya prakaar ke magaramachhon kii tulana main, khaare pani ke magaramchh kii gardan par kavach platon kii sankhya kam hoti he or adhikansh anya patale sharir ke magaramachhon kii tulana main iske sharir kaa chaudaa hona, is asatyaapit manyata ko janm detaa he kii sarisrup ek eligator tha
 An adult male saltwater crocodile weighs between 600 and 1,000 kg and is generally 4
1 to 5
5 meters in length
 haalanki paripakv nar kii lambaai 6 meter yaa adhik or bhaar 1,300 kilogram yaa adhik bhi ho saktaa he
 Compared to any other modern crocodile species, sexual dimorphism is more frequent in this species, with females being much smaller in size than males

 The length of the largest female recorded so far has been measured at about 4

 The largest size of saltwater crocodile is a matter of considerable controversy
 ab tak thuthan se lekar poonch tak maapi gayi sabase lambe magaramchh kii lambaai 6
1 meter thi, jo vastav main ek mrit magaramchh kii twachaa thi
 Since the skin shrinks slightly after the removal of the dead skin layer, the estimated length of this crocodile in the living stage would have been 6
3 meters and probably weighed more than 1,200 kg
 aisa daawa kiya gaya he ki adhure avshesh ek 7
6-meter magaramchh ke hai, parantu visheshgyon ke dwaara kiye gaye pareekshan bataate hai ki isaki lambaai 7 meter se adhik nahin hogi
 There are innumerable claims of crocodiles in the 9-meter range: a crocodile shot in the Bay of Bengal in 1940 was recorded at 10 meters; Another crocodile was killed at Jaljala on the main island of Luzon in the Philippines in 1823, recorded at 8
2 meters; a crocodile recorded at 7
6 meters was killed in the Hooghly River in Alipur district of Calcutta
 haalanki, in jaanwaron kii khopadiyon ke pareekshan vastav main ingit karte hai ki ye jaanavar 6 se 6
6 meter kii range se the
 Due to the recent restoration of saltwater crocodile habitat and reduced poaching, it is possible that 7-meter crocodiles are alive today
 ginis ne is daawey ko sweekaar kiya he ki ek 7-meter nar khaare pani kaa magaramchh bharat ke urisa rajya main bhitarkanika park main rahata he, haalanki, ek bahut bade aakaar ke jivit magaramchh ko pakadaney or iske maapan main hone vaali kathinaayee ke kaaran, in ayaamon kii sateekta kaa satyaapan ab tak kiya janaa baaki he
 a crocodile shot in Queensland in 1957 was 8
5 meters in length, but this measurement has not been verified, nor do any remains of this crocodile exist anymore
 is magaramchh kii ek "pratikruti" banaai gayi he jo paryatakon ke aakarshan kaa centre ban gayi he
 Several crocodiles over 8 meters long have also been recorded but have not been confirmed, and are highly unlikely
 khaare pani kaa magaramchh bharat main pai jane vaali magaramchh kii teen prajatiyon main se ek he, iske alaava magar kahe jane magaramchh or ghadiyal paae jate hai

 Saltwater crocodiles are growing in number in northern Australia, especially in the majority of river systems near Darwin where large-sized fauna are common
 australian khaare pani ke magaramachhon kii aabaadi anumaanatah 100,000 or 200,000 vayaskon ke bich he
 These extend from Broome in Western Australia to Rockhampton in Queensland, down the whole of the Northern Territory coast
 taaje pani main paae jane vaale magaramachhon kii tulana main khaare pani ke magaramachhon ke eligator se milte julate hone ke kaaran, uttari australia kii eligator nadiyon kaa naam badal gaya he
 Freshwater crocodiles also live in the northern region
 new gini main bhi ve aam hai, jo sabhi jowarandamukh or mangrove sahit desh main lagbhag sabhi nadi pranaaliyon ke tateey kshetron main paae jate hai
 They are also found in varying numbers in the Bismarck Archipelago, Kai Island, Aaru Island, Maluku Island and the islands that fall in the Timor region and most islands within the Torres Strait
 khaare pani kaa magaramchh aitihaasik rup se puure dakshin purvi asia main paaya gaya, lekin ab is range main se vilupt ho chukaa he
 This species has not been recorded in forests for decades in most parts of Indochina and has become extinct in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and possibly Cambodia
 myanmar ek adhikansh hison main is prajati kii sthiti jatil he, lekin irrwaddi delta main kai bade aakaar ke vayaskon kii ek sthir aabaadi he
 It is possible that Myanmar is the only country in Indochina where wild populations of this species still exist
 haalanki ek samay tha jab mekong delta or anya nadi pranaaliyon main khaare pani ke magaramchh bahut aam the, indochina main is prajati kaa bhavishya khatre main nazar aa rahaa he
 However, there is also little chance that the crocodile puri will be extinct from the world, as its distribution is wide and its population size in northern Australia and New Guinea is of pre-colonial type
 indonesia or malaysia main isaki aabaadi chhitput he, jabaki kuch kshetron main adhik aabaadi bhi he or kai anya sthanon par isaki aabaadi bahut kam he, jo jokhim par he,

 The saltwater crocodile is also found in a very limited part of the South Pacific, Solomon Islands has an average population, Vanuatu has a very small population, aggressive and quickly extinct, and in Palau this population is not aggressive, but the risk But there was a time when saltwater crocodiles were found in the island of Seychelles from the northern coast of Africa to the west
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki ye magaramchh nil nadi kii aabaadi hai, lekin baad main yah pramanit ho gaya ki ve ye crocodilas porosus hai
 Because this species has a tendency to travel long distances across the sea, sometimes these crocodiles are also seen in strange places where they are not local residents
 awaar kism ke jeev bhi aitihaasik rup se new calladonia, lavo jima, fiji or yahaan tak ki japan ke apekshaakrit udasin samudr main bhi paae gaye hai
 Several wild saltwater crocodiles were found in Fraser Island's river system in the late 2008 / early 2009s, in thousands of kilometers of colder waters than their normal Queensland range
 aisa paaya gaya ki vastav main ye magaramchh garm or nam mausam ke dauraan uttari queensland se apravas kar ke dakshin main aa jate the or sambhavatya taapmaana girane par phir se uttar ko laut aate the
 Despite the surprise of Fraser Island's public, this is apparently not a new behavior and it has been found many times before that wild crocodiles have migrated south to Brisbane during hot humid weather
 khaare pani ke magaramchh aamtaur par ushnkaribandheey nam mausam ke dauraan daldal or taaje pani kii nadiyon main paae jate hai or shushk mausam main neeche kii ore jowarandamukh kii taraf chale jate hai, kabhi kabhi bahut dur tak yatra karte hue samudr ke baahar tak bhi aa jate hai
 Crocodiles have to compete heavily with dominant male organisms, especially to find a place in the most suitable freshwater rivers
 is prakaar se chote magaramchh seemaant nadi pranaaliyon or kabhi kabhi samudr main jane ki liye majaboor ho jate hai
 This fact explains the wide distribution of this animal
 Also, sometimes it can be found in strange places
 Saltwater crocodiles swim in small groups, 15 to 18 miles per hour, but when swimming in large groups 2 to 3 miles / hour khaare pani kaa magaramchh ek avasarwaadi sheersh shikari he jo iske kshetra main pravesh karne vaale lagbhag kisi bhi jaanavar kaa shikaar kar saktaa he, chaahe vah pani main ho yaa shushk bhoomi par
 ve inke kshetra main pravesh karne vaale manushyon par bhi hamalaa karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Juvenile organisms are prohibited from hunting small animals such as pests, amphibians, crabs, small reptiles and fish
 As the animal grows older, its diet includes a variety of animals, although relatively small size prey Also form an important part of an adult's diet
 bade aakaar ke vyask khaare pani ke magaramchh apni range main aane vaale kisi bhi jaanavar ko kha sakate hai, isamen bandar, kangaroo, junglee boar, dingo, goana, pakshi, gharelu pashu, paaltu jaanavar, manushya, pani kii bhens, gaur, chamagadad or yahaan tak ki shark bhi shaamil he
 Domestic animals, horses, water buffalo and gaur, all of which weigh more than a ton, are considered to be the largest prey by male crocodiles
 aam taur par ye bahut sust hote hai- yah ek aisi visheshta he jisaki vajah se ye kai maheenon tak bhojan ke bina jivit rah sakate hai- ye aksar pani main matargashti karte hai or din main dhoop senkate hai or raat main shikaar karnaa pasand karte hai
 Saltwater crocodiles move at explosive speeds when attacked by water
 magaramchh kii kahaniyon ko bhoomi par kam duuri ke liye res ke ghode kii tulana main adhik janaa jaataa he, ye shahari kahaniyon se kuch badhkar hai
 On the water's edge, however, they can combine propulsion with both legs and tail, its direct vision is rare
 hamalaa karne se pehle yah aamtaur par intjaar karata he ki shikaar pani ke kinare par aa jaye, iske baad yah apni puri kshamta se jaanavar ko pani main khinch letaa he
 Most prey animals are killed by crocodile jaw pressure, although some animals drown by chance
 yah ek shaktishaalee jaanavar he, yah ek purna viksit pani kii bhens ko nadi main ghaseet saktaa he, yaa purna viksit bovid ko apane jabadon se kuchal saktaa he
 Its hunting technique is known as the "death roll": it rolls the animal to its full potential
 isse kisi bhi sangharshrat jaanavar kaa santulan bighad jaataa he, jisase ise pani main kheenchna aasaan ho jaataa he
 The "death roll" technique is also used to tear a dead animal
 khaare pani ke shishu magaramchh chhipakali, shikari machhlee, pakshi or kai anya shikariyon kaa shikaar bhi ban sakate hai
 Teens may also fall prey to Bengal tigers and leopards in their range, although this is rare
 ek shodhakarta, dow adam brittan, ne magaramachhon kii hoshiyaari yaa sahajagyaan par adhyayan kiya he
 He has compiled a collection of Australian crocodile voices, and correlates them with their behavior
 unke anusaar magaramchh ke mastishk kaa aakaar stanadhariyon kii tulana main kaaphi chota hota he, ve bahut kam sharton ke saath bahut mushkil kaam ko bhi sikh sakate hai
 He also concludes that the crocodile voice has a profound potential for language
 jabaki vartmaan main is kshamta ko itnaa adhik sweekaar nahin kiya gaya he
 He suggests that saltwater crocodiles are cunning animals, which can learn more quickly than laboratory mice
 ve mausam main parivartan ke saath apane shikaar ke apravasi maarg kaa pataa lagaana bhi sikh lete hai
 The figures for attacks outside Australia are limited
 australia main hamale durlabh hai or jab kabhi ye hamale hote hai, to rashtriya samachar prakashnon main dikhaai dete hai
 Every year about one or two fatal attacks are reported in the country
 chote str ke hamale sambhavatya australia main vanyajeev adhikariyon ke dwaara kiye jane vaale gahan prayaason ke kaaran hote hai, jab ve kai jokhim yukt nadamukhon, nadiyon, jhiilon or samudr ke kinaaron par chetavanee ke sanket lagane kaa kaam kar rahe hote hai
 The attacks on large tribal communities of Arnhem land are not recorded at all

 Some vapors also run on solar energy, nuclear energy or geothermal energy, which was discovered in 1763 vaise to bhaap ke ingine kaa itihaas bahut purana he 
 But the earlier tips were not practical in terms of power generation

 Although now steam-powered trains and other machines have faded, almost half of the world's electric power is still being generated with the help of steam turbines
 bhaap ingine banane ke ytn kaa sabase pracheen ullekh alexandria ke hero ke lekhon main miltaa he
 Hero was a member of the famous Alexandrian sect schwör bei koran which included masters of erstwhile sciences such as Ptolemy, Euclid, Eratosthenes
 hero ne apane lekh main ek aisi yukti kaa varnan kiya he jisamen ek band baks main vaayu garm kii jaati thi or ek nalee ke maarg se neeche pani bhare bartan kii ore failati thi
 The water of the vessel used to flow into the second tube and it became a fake shower
 phir iske baad is sambandh main kahin koi vivaran nahin miltaa he
 In 1606 AD, some 2,000 years from Hero, Marquesave della Porta, founder of Napoleon's Academy and then a pioneer of science in Europe, used steam instead of air in Hero's sprinkling experiment
 unhone yah bhi sujhaayaa ki kisi bartan ko pani se bharne ke liye yadi use ek nalee dwaara pani se kisi talab se sambandhit kar diya jaay or tab us bartan main bhaap bharkar phir use upar se pani ke dwaara thanda kiya jaay to bheetar kii bhaap sanghanit hokar nirvaat utpann karegi or uski jagah talab se pani bartan main bhar jayega
 In 1698, this suggestion of Marquesve della Porta was used by Thomas Savory in a water dispenser
 is prakaar severy pehla vyakti tha jisane vyavsaayik upyog kaa ek bhaap ingine banaaya, jiskaa upyog khadaanon main se pani ulichane or kuon main se pani nikaalane main hua
 The next stage of the steam engine was the invention of the Neocomain engine after the invention of the engine of Savory

 Cylinders and pistons were used for the first time in this engine, which are still used in steam locomotives

 Piston lifting, which causes water to rise, exerts atmospheric pressure
 lekin bhaap ko keval sanghanit karne main bahut eendhan vyarth kharch hota he
 The important work of James Watt is to give the best form of steam engine, which increased the power of human beings ten times and made a huge change in the commercial field

 By repairing it, Watts noticed that the fuel wasted badly
 vichaarsheel swabhaav ke wat ne isse shreshth mashin banane kaa vichaar prarambh kar diya
 In this way, he made many discoveries and instruments, from which the steam engine got its present form and became a powerful instrument in the progress of industry and civilization
 bhaap ingine ke nimnlikhit mukhya prakaar hai : In a single-engine engine, the steam acts on one side of the piston and in the two-way engine the steam works on both sides of the piston

 This is the reason that an action engine is rarely used these days
 silinder kii dhuree ke urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij hone ke anusaar ingine urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij kaha jaataa he
 The horizontal engine occupies more space than the vertical engine
 urdhwadhar prakaar ke ingine main gharshan aadi kam hota he, jiske kaaran yah kshaitij ingine kii tulana main adhik din tak chal saktaa he
 The speed of a steam engine is in fact its crank shaft rotation per minute
 chaar foot piston stroke evam 80 parikraman prati mintewale ingine main ausat piston chaal 640 foot prati minute hogi
 This engine will be called the low speed engine
 saadhaarant: 100 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se kam chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko nimna chaal ingine kehete hai evam 250 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se adhik chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko ucch chaal ingine kehete hai
 An engine running between 100 and 250 revolutions per minute is called a "medium speed engine"
 ucch chaal ingine kii sabase bada gun yah he ki samaan shakti ke liye yah bahut hi chote aakaar kaa hota he
 Steam is also less expensive due to the high speed, as heat transfer between steam and cylinder takes a very short time in this type of engine

 After working steam in the condensing engine, it enters the condenser and converts it into water at atmospheric pressure there
 sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karne se bhaap adhik kaary kar paati he
 In simple engines, each cylinder receives steam directly from the boiler and exhales directly into the atmosphere or condenser
 sanyoji ingine main bhaap ek silinder main, jise ucch daab silinder kehete hai, kuch had tak prasaarit hoti he or uske baad usase kuch bade silinder main, jise nimna daab silinder kehete hai, pravesh karti he evam yahan prasar kii kriya purna hoti he
 Often the low pressure cylinder exits the condenser
 prasar teen yaa chaar silinder main bhi ho saktaa he evam in injanon ko triprasar ingine yaa chatushprasar ingine kehete hai
 The heat engine has the maximum efficiency / T1 with T1 and T2 being the maximum and minimum temperatures in the heat engine cycle
 isse pataa chalata he ki ingine kii dakshata in donon tapon par nirbhar karti he
 The efficiency of the steam engine will increase as the value of it increases and the value of it decreases
 ke mulya ko badhaane ke liye byler se nikal kar ingine main aanevaali bhaap kii daab ko badhanaa hoga, kyonki bhaap kii daab jitani hi adhik hogi kaa mulya utana hi badhegaa
 There is another way to increase
 vah he bhaap ko atitapit karnaa
 The superheat of steam is increased by treating the superheat in the boiler
 ke maan ko kam karne ke liye sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The condenser is converted into steam water by cold water
 at: achche sanghnitr main kaa maan thande jal ke taap ke baraabar ho saktaa he
 This suggests that the engine will be more efficient by having more pressure in the steam engine and the work done by the superheated steam and converting the steam to water at a temperature equal to the temperature of the cold water obtainable in the condenser
 boyler se bhaap ucch daab par bhapapeti main pravesh karti he
 As soon as the piston reaches the end of the stroke, at the same time the valve moves, in which the steam opens and the steam enters the cylinder
 bhaap kii daab dwaara dhakka die jane se piston aage badhata he
 This is called front stroke
 piston kii chaal dwaara crank, crank shaft evam utkendrak chalate hai
 The entrance of the fender opens the door a bit more
 silinder main bhaap tab tak pravesh karti rahati he jab tak dwaar ekadam band nahin ho jaataa
 At this time, there is a breakup and after this the steam is not stored in the cylinder
 silinder main ai hui bhaap ab prasaarit hoti he evam is prasar main bhaap kaa aaytan bad jaataa he evam daab kam ho jaati he
 Steam works at similar times
 agr stroke ke ant main valve bhapadwar ko nikaas kii ore khol detaa he, jisase bhaap nirmukt hoti he
 The pressure of the ejected steam becomes equal to the back pressure
 nirmochan hone ke kuch kshan ke baad piston peeche kii ore lautataa he evam ise prayaavartan stroke kehete hai
 The piston exhausts the remaining steam in the cylinder while returning to this stroke
 jab piston is stroke ke ant par pahunchataa he, valve nikaas dwaar ko band kar detaa he, jisase bhaap kaa pravaah band ho jaataa he
 There is some steam left between the cylinder top and the piston, which is not released
 phir chakra kii punrariti hoti he
 In this two-way engine, the action of the same chakra is on the other side of the cylinder
 rankin chakra ek saidhantik chakra he, jiske anusaar bhaap ingine kaary karata he
 The main function of the speed regulator is to regulate the speed of the engine
 bhaap ingine ke gati-niamak in do tareekon main se ek hi sahaayta se paribhraman kii gati sthir rakh paata he: The speed regulator, which regulates engine speed by increasing or decreasing the pressure of steam according to the demand of power, is called a barrier regulator
 gatiniamak ek avrodh valve ko chalaata he, jo mukhya bhaap nalee main rakhaa hota he
 In this type of gait regulator, the main motile condyle is the motile regulator
 valve santulit prakaar kaa hota he, arthath bhaapadaab dwaara parinami bal shunya hota he
 When the engine speed increases, the speed of the revolutions of the accelerating condensates also increases, which increases the centrifugal force
 bal kii yah vruddhi unhen gurutvkarshnabal evam niyantran kamaani ke viruddh baahar chalane kaa baadhya karti he
 This causes the valve to close in part
 valve dwaara avrodh hone par piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main kami ho jaati he, jiske kaaran utpann shakti bhi kam ho jaati he
 And as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and the pressure of the steam acting on the piston increases, which in turn increases the speed to normal speed
 But it comes
 avrodh gati-niamak dwaara niyamit bhaap ingine main prayog ke baad yadi ingine main prati ghante vyavahrut bhaap kii taul ko ashwashakti ke saath aankaa jaae, to ek saral rekha praapt hogi
 This relationship was first found by Willian
 at: inhen ke naam par ise "vilian kii rekha" kehete hai
 The gaitpalakchakra is stuck with the key to Isha
 nimna gativale bharvahak jalpoton main bade nodak lagaae jate hai evam ye nodak prati minute 80 parikraman karte hai
 Steam engines are very suitable in such vessels
