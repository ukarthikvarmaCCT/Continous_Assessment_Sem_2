 duusare deshon kii vaigyanik paramparaon ke saath milakar isane nayaa rup grahan kiya
 After the Mughal rule, when the British rule was established, once again the tradition of science in India was oriented towards rapid development
 ab tak vibhinn samskritiyon ke saath milakar bhartiya vaigyanik parampara kaaphi praudh ho chuki thi
 During the British rule, various sources and resources of knowledge science developed, due to which the scientific tradition of this place got a lot of fertile land to develop and it made achievements in diverse fields

 The Vedic Indians had knowledge of 27 constellations
 ve varsh, maheenon or dinon ke rup main samay ke vibhaajan se parichit the
 a sage named ‘lagadh’ arranged the then astronomical knowledge in ‘astrology Vedang’
 ganit or jyamiti kaa vaidic yug main paryaapt vikaas hua tha
 Vedic period could be calculated as long as Indian

 Ayurvedic medicine was used in abundance
 aavashyaktaa padane par shalya-chikitsa bhi kii jaati thi
 Later, Arabs and Greeks also adopted surgery
 phir to rome samrajya main bhartiya jadi-bootiyon kii bhi maang chikitsa ke kshetra main hone lagi
 At the same time, studies of the external and internal structures of flora and fauna were also done
 krishi ke kshetra main mitti kii uvarrata badhaane ke liye fasal chakra kii paddati tab bhi apanaai jaati thi
 The golden period of scientific progress in India lasted from the fourth century before Christ to the sixth or seventh century after Christ
 dhaatu-karm, bhautikee, rasayan-shaastra jaise vigyaanon kaa vikaas bhi is yug main hua tha
 In the Mauryan period, weapons and weapons were developed for war
 kuch yantric astron, jaise - prakshepakon kaa vikaas tathaa sinchai main abhiyantriki kaa upyog ullekhneey he
 In this period, the technique of soil survey was highly developed
 vishalkay prastar stambhon ke nirmaan main anek prakaar ke vaigyanik kaushalon kaa upyog is yug kii ek anya visheshta he
 After this, there was a remarkable progress in all branches of science during the Gupta period
 beej ganit, jyamiti, rasayan shaastra, bhautikee, dhaatushilp, chikitsa, khagol vigyaan kaa vikaas charam seemaa par tha
 In this era, there were many famous scientists whose research and inventions were believed by the people of the then civilized society
 yah vigyaan bharat main hi viksit hua
 About 1000 years before the famous German astronomer Copernicus, Aryabhata confirmed the round shape of the Earth and its rotation on its own axis
 isi tarah ijak newton se 1000 varsh purv hi brahmagupta ne prithvi ke gurutvkarshan siddhant kii pushti kar di thi
 It is a different matter that western scientists got their credit for some reasons
 bhartiya khagol vigyaan kaa udbhav vedon se mana jaataa he
 Vedic era was a devout Indian man
 ve apane yajna tathaa anya dharmik anushthan grahon kii sthiti ke anusaar shubh lagn dekhakar kiya karte the
 He developed astronomy to know auspicious lagna
 vaidic arya surya kii uttarayan or dakshinyan gati se parichit the
 The only scripture of Vedic astronomy is 'vedang Astrology'
 isaki rachana ‘lagadh’ naamak rishi ne isa se lagbhag 100 varsh purv kii thi
 Information related to astronomy is also found in Mahabharata
 mahabharat main chandragrahan or suryagrahan kii charchaa he
 The people of this period were aware that eclipses can only occur on Amavasya and Purnima
 is kaal ke logon kaa grahon ke vishay main bhi acha gyaan tha
 After 'vedang Astrology', there is no astronomy book for about a thousand years
 paanchavin shatabdi main aryabhatta ne sarvapratham logon ko bataaya ki prithvi gol he or yah apni dhari par chakkar lagaati he
 He also estimated the size, speed and circumference of the Earth
 aryabhatta ne surya or chandra grahan ke sahi kaarnon kaa pataa lagaaya
 According to him, the eclipse occurs due to the reflection of the moon and the earth
 chandramaa main apana prakaash nahin he, vah surya ke prakaash se prakashit he
 Similarly, Aryabhata refuted the theory of Rahu and Ketu taking the sun and the moon and giving the correct scientific theory of the eclipse
 aryabhatta ne ‘aryabhatiy’ tathaa ‘arya siddhant’ naamak granthon kii rachana kii thi
 Aryabhata was followed by an astronomer named Varahamihira in the sixth century
 vigyaan ke itihaas main ve pratham vyakti the, jinhone kaha ki koi aisi shakti he, jo vastuon ko dharaatal se baandho rakhti he
 Today, this power is called gravity
 varahamihir kaa kahana tha ki prithvi gol he, jiske dharaatal par pahaad, nadiyaan, ped-paudho, nagar aadi faile hue hai
 'panchsiddhantika' and 'suryasiddhanta' are his astronomy books
 inke atirikt varahamihir ne ‘vrihatsamhita’ or ‘vrihajjatak’ naam kii pustaken bhi likhi hai
 After this, Brahmagupta also has a significant contribution in Indian astronomy
 inkaa kaarykaal saatvin shatabdi se mana jaataa he
 He was probably the first great mathematician in India to use algebra in astronomy calculations
 ‘brahmagupta siddhant’ inkaa pramukh granth he
 In addition, in the last years of his life, Brahmagupta also wrote a book titled 'khanda Foodak'
 inhone vibhinn grahon kii gati or sthiti, unke udai or ast, yuti tathaa surya grahan kii gananaa karne kii vidhiyon kaa varnan kiya he
 Brahmagupta's knowledge of the planets was based on direct perforation
 inkaa maananaa tha ki jab kabhi gananaa or vedh main antar padane lage to vedh ke dwaara gananaa shuddh kar leni chahie
 They considered the earth to be round and they have strongly criticized the idea of considering the earth as flat in the Puranas
 brahmagupta aryabhatta ke anek siddhanton ke saath prithvi ke apni dhari par ghoomane ke siddhant ke bhi aalochak the
 Brahmagupta agreed with the theory of the attraction power of the earth
 unke anusaar ‘vastuen prithvi kii ore girti hai kyonki prithvi kii prakruti he ki vah unhen apni ore aakarshith kare
 ' brahmagupta ke baad khagol vigyaan main bhaskaracharya kaa vishisht yogadan he
 Their time was twelfth century
 ve ganit ke prakand pandit the
 He composed two texts named 'siddhantshiromani' and 'karan Kutuhal'
 khagolvid ke rup main bhaskaracharya apni ‘taatkaalik gati’ kii avadharna ke liye prasiddh hai
 This helps astrophysicists to gain accurate knowledge of planetary motion
 bhaskar ne ek to gole kii sataha or uske ghanfal ko nikaalane ke german jyotirvid kepler ke niyam kaa purvaabhyas kar liya tha
 Secondly, he gave the theory of gravity about 500 years before Isaac Newton, born in the seventeenth century
 adhiktar khoj or avishkaar jin par aaj europe ko itnaa garv he, ek viksit ganitiya paddati ke bina asambhav the
 This method also would not have been possible if Europe had been bound by the heavy Roman numerals
 nai paddati ko khoj nikaalane vaala vah agyaat vyakti bharat kaa putr tha
 Medieval Indian mathematicians, such as Brahmagupta, Mahavira and Bhaskar, made many discoveries that Europe was unfamiliar with until the Renaissance period or even beyond
 isamen koi matbhed nahin ki bharat main ganit kii ucchkoti kii parampara thi
 People of Harappan culture must have been familiar with numbers and numbers
 is yug kii lipi ke ab tak na padhe ja sakane ke kaaran nishchit rup se kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But numbers and numbers must have been definitely used in the construction of buildings, roads, drains, bathrooms, etc
 maap-taul or vyapaar kya bina ankon or sankhyaon ke sambhav tha? harappakalin samskruti kii lipi ke padhe jane ke baad nishchit hi anek nae tathy udghaatit honge
 After this Vedic era Indians used numbers and numbers
 vaidic yug ke ek rishi medhatithi 1012 tak kii badi sankhyaon se parichit the
 He used ten and its multiples in his calculations
 ‘yajurveda samhita’ adhyay 17, mantra 2 main 10, xxwrep 2 00, 000 tak kii sankhya kaa ullekh he
 The Jain text 'anuayog Dwar Sutra' is 100 years before Christ
 isamen asankhya tak gananaa kii gai he, jiskaa pariman 10140 ke baraabar he
 At that time the name of the largest number in Greece was 'miriad', which was 10,000, and the largest number of Romans was named Milli, which was 1000
 shunya kaa upyog pingal ne apane chhandsutra main isa ke 200 varsh purv kiya tha
 After this, zero has been used in many texts
 lekin brahmagupta pehle bhartiya ganitagya the jinhone shunya ko prayog main laane ke niyam banaae
 According to unhone yah galat kaha ki shunya se vibhajit karo to parinaam shunya hota he kyonki aaj ham jaanate hai ki yah anant kii sankhya hoti he
 Now it has been proved indisputably that India has given the modern system of writing numbers to the world
 jyamiti kaa gyaan harappakalin samskruti ke logon ko bhi tha
 The shape of bricks, the shape of buildings, the cutting of roads at right angles indicate that people of that period had knowledge of geometry
 vaidic kaal main arya yajna kii vediyon ko banane ke liye jyamiti ke gyaan kaa upyog karte the
 The method of making squares and rectangles is given in 'shulbasutra'
 bhujaa ke sambandh ko lekar varg ke samaan aayat, varg ke samaan vrutt aadi prashnon par is granth main vichaar kiya gaya he
 Drawing a square equal to a triangle, making a square that is two times, three times or one third of a square, making a square whose area is equal to the area of the square present, etc
 is also given in the 'shulb Sutra'
 aryabhatta ne vrutt kii paridhi or vyas ke anupaat kaa maan 3
1416 sthapit kiya he
 He stated for the first time that this is the approximate value of pie
 trikonmiti ke kshetra main bharatiyon ne jo kaam kiya, vah anupmey or moulik he
 He invented sine, cosine and entropy
 varahamihir krit ‘surya siddhant’ main trikonmiti kaa jo vivaran he, uskaa gyaan europe ko brigs ke dwaara solahavin shatabdi main mila
 Brahmagupta has also written on trigonometry and has given a sine table
 bharatiyon ne bijganit main bhi badi dakshata praapt kii thi
 Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskaracharya, Sridharacharya etc
 were famous mathematicians
 bijganit ke kshetra main sabase badi uplabdhi he - 'anivaary varg sameekaran kaa hal prastut karnaa'
 In the history of Western mathematics, the solution of this equation is attributed to 'john Pell' and is known as 'pell equation', but the reality is that Brahmagupta solved this equation a thousand years before Pell
 Was presented iske liye brahmagupta ne do prameyakaon kii khoj kii thi
 The Indian name for the mandatory class equation is class-nature
 bharat main chikitsa vigyaan kii sudeergh parampara he
 Vedas have been given respect like medical science
 yahi kaaran he ki bhartiya chikitsa paddati ko ayurveda kii sangya se abhinihit kiya jaataa he
 The first written knowledge about Indian system of medicine is found in 'atharvaveda'
 atharvaveda main vividh rogon ke upachaararth prayog kiye jane sambandh bhishajya sutara sankalit hai
 In these formulas, names of different diseases and different types of medicines for their treatment have also been given
 jal chikitsa, surya kiran chikitsa or maansik chikitsa ke vishyon par isamen vistrut vivaran miltaa he
 After the Atharvaveda, about 600 years before Christ, 'charaksamhita' on karya therapy and 'sushruta Samhita' on surgery are found
 ye chikitsa shaastra ke pramanik or vishwavikhyath granth hai
 Maharishi Charaka is credited with writing the first treatise of Kayama

 There was chaos and chaos all around
 aisi sthiti main vaigyanik anusandhan karne kaa kise hosh tha
 Scientific activities continued in some parts of South India only
 angrejon ke aagaman ke baad kaafii samay tak chhitput ladaaiyaan chalati raheen
 After the British took over almost all of India, some Indians made significant achievements in the field of science
 bharat main aadhunik vaigyanik parampara kaa vikaas mukhya rup se east india company kii sthapana ke baad se shuru hua
 Here one thing is mainly to pay attention
 vah yah ki aadhunik vaigyanik parampara pracheen vaigyanik parampara se bahut bhinn nahin he
 Rather it has developed into a link that leads to it
 donon paramparaon ke vikaas main ek moolbhoot antar he, vah he yantriki kaa vikaas
 The ancient Indian tradition had developed quite rapidly in various fields of science, but did not achieve any significant achievement at the mechanics level
 aadhunik vaigyanik parampara yaheen se pracheen vaigyanik parampara se khud ko alag kar leti he
 Looking at the whole modern scenario, the biggest achievement of the modern scientific tradition has been the development of mechanics
 ab tak jo bhi pracheen vaigyanik uplabdhiyaan thim unheen ko adhar banaate hue yantriki kaa vikaas kiya gaya or yah parampara puri duniya main prachlit ho gai
 Then with the development of mechanics, many avenues of new research were opened in science, such as the development of computers, it made easy for new experiments in every field of chemistry, physical, biology etc
 aadhunik vaigyanik parampara ke ek-saath puri duuniya main prasar ke peeche mukhya kaaran tha - duniya ke zyaadaatar deshon main angrejon kaa raaj
 Similarly, whatever mechanical or scientific tradition developed, it became prevalent all over the world at little difference or simultaneously
 atah aadhunik vaigyanik parampara ne desh or kaal kii seemayen bhi todi
 In the same way, scientists of different countries have not only achieved scientific achievements at their level, they have also made many new discoveries by taking inspiration from the discoveries of other scientists as well as furthering the discoveries of others
 is tarah bhartiya aadhunik vaigyanik parampara ke vikaas kaa adhyayan karte samay hamen mukhya rup se do pakshon par dhayaan rakhana aavashyak hoga- 1
 The fundamental scientific tradition of modern India and 2
 aadhunik bharat kii mishrit vaigyanik parampara Under this tradition, those scientific discoveries can be kept, which originated in India and lived in India, made the same scientific discoveries from its resources and set an example in front of the world
 vaise to angrejon ke aane ke baad zyaadaatar vaigyanik khoj angrejon ke dwaara hi kii gai, kintu unke saath-saath bhartiya vaigyanikon ne bhi anek prayog kiye or uplabdhiyaan hasil kin

 america main iskaa prarambh enbisi par oktober 28, 2011, ko hua tha
 The story of the program revolves around Police Officer Nick Burkhart
 pratham prakaran main nik ko apni antee se pataa chalata he ki vah ek grim he tathaa uske bhagya main alokik jivo va vibhinn prakaar ke shaitano se ladanaa he
 Most of the characters in the series are inspired by Grimm's fairy tales
 haalanki isaki kahaniyaan or kai paatr anya sroto se bhi liye gaye hai
 Myocardial infarction or acute myocardial infarction is commonly known as a heart attack or heart attack, in which there is an obstruction of blood circulation in some parts of the heart, causing the heart cells to die
 yah aamtaur par kamjor dhamnikalakaathinya pattica ke vidaaran ke baad parihrid-dhamni ke rodh ke kaaran hota he, jo ki lipid kaa ek asthir sangrah or dhamni pattee main shwet rakt koshika hota he
 As a result of ischemic anemia and lack of oxygen, if left untreated for a long period, heart muscle tissue damage or death may occur
 teevr rodhgalan ke shastreey lakshanon main achaanak chaati main dard,, saans kii takalif, michali, ulti, ghabrahat, pasinaa or chintaa shaamil hai
 mahilaon ko purushon ke mukaable kam vishisht lakshan anubhav ho saktaa he, aamtaur par saans kii kami, thakaan, apach or kamajori
 sabhi rodhgalan daure seene main dard yaa anya lakshan ke bina lagbhag ek chauthai "niskriy" hote hai
 Diagnostic tests to detect available heart muscle damage include electrocardiograms, echocardiography, and various blood tests
 The most frequently used markers are creatine kinase-mb and troponin t levels
 Immediate treatment for suspected acute myocardial infusion includes oxygen, aspirin, and subcutaneous nitroglycerin
 estiemai ke adhikansh maamalon ko thrambolysis yaa parcutanies coronary intervension ke saath ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 NSTEMI ko dawa ke saath prabandhit kiya janaa chahie, haalanki aspataal pravesh ke dauraan PCI kaa aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 ve log jinamein kai rukaawatein or jo apekshaakrit sthir rahe hai, yaa kuch apatkaaleen maamalon main, bypass surgery ek vikalp ho saktaa he
 Heart attacks are one of the main causes of death for both men and women worldwide
 Important risk factors are prior heart disease, older age, high blood pressure of certain lipids of tobacco smoking and low levels of high density lipoprotein, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, excessive alcohol consumption , Drug abuse and chronic high stress levels
 teevr rodhgalan ke do buniyadi prakaar hote hai: Clinically, an infarction can be classified as an ST elevation MI versus a non-st elevation MI based on ECG changes
 achaanak hriday maut kaa varnan karne ke liye kabhi-kabhi "dil kaa daura" vaakyansh kaa istemaal galat tareeke se kiya jaataa he jo ki teevr rodhgalan ke parinamswaroop ho saktaa he yaa nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 dil kaa daura isse alag hota he, lekin purnahridrodh kaa kaaran ho saktaa he jo ki dil kii dhadkan or asaamaanya dhadkan hrid-atalata ko roktaa he
 saath hi yah hridpaat se bhi alag hota he, jisamen dil ko pump karne main asamarth hota he; gambhir rodhgalan se hridpaat ho saktaa he, lekin aisa hona jaruri nahin he
 a consensus document in 2007 categorized myocardial infarction into five main types: rodhgalan main lakshanon kii shuruyaat aamtaur par kai minuton tak dhire-dhire hoti he or shaayad hi kabhi achaanak hoti he
 teevr rodhgalan ke lakshanon main seene main dard hona saamaanya he or aksar pakadan, dabaav, yaa nichod kii sansani mahasoos hoti he
 dil peshi ke sthanik araktata ke kaaran chaati main dard ko engina pectoris kaha jaataa he
 aamtaur par baane baanh main sabase adhik dard hota he, lekin dard nichle jabade, gardan, daane baanh, peeth or adhijthar, jahaan yah dil ke jalane kaa kaary kar saktaa he, main fail saktaa he
 lewine sin, jisamen rogi ko urafalak main modan ke dwaara chaati main dard mahasoos karata he, jise aam taur par cardiyak chaati dard kaa bhavi suchak mana jaataa he, haalanki ek sambhavit avlokan adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki iskaa ek kamjor sakaaratmak bhavi suchak mulya tha
 Shortness of breath occurs when heart damage limits production of the left ventricle, causing left ventricular failure and pulmonary edema
 Other symptoms include diaphoresis weakness, mild headache, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations
 These symptoms are induced by the sympathetic nervous system with a high likelihood of catecholamines that are in response to pain and hemodynamic abnormalities that do not perform cardiac function
 Happens as a result of
 Loss of consciousness and sudden death can be found in myocardial infarction
 mahilaon or vayask rogiyon samakakshon ke vicitra report unamem purush or yuvaaon kii tulana main adhik lakshan paae jate hai
 purushon kii tulana main mahilaon main lakshan kii report adhik hoti he 
 mahilaon main emai kaa sabase aam lakshanon main se dispaniya, kamajori or thakaan shaamil he
 thakaan, neend gadabadi or dispaniya ko aksar hone vaale lakshanon main paaya jaataa he jo ki vaastavik chikitsakeey prakat isckemik ghatana se pehle ek maheene ke lambey samay tak ho saktaa he
 purushon kii tulana main mahilaon main seene main dard se coronary ishemia ke hone kii sambhaavna kam hoti he
 About a quarter of myocardial infarction is calm, without any chest pain or other symptoms
 Such cases can be detected later by electrocardiograms, in which autopsy is used without prior history of blood enzyme testing or related complaints
 This calming symptom is more common in elderly people, patients with diabetes mellitus, and possibly after heart transplant, because the recipient's nervous system is unable to fully generate power in the donor heart
 In diabetic patients, differences in initial pain, autonomic neuropathy, and psychological factors have been cited as possible explanations for the lack of symptoms
 dil main raktapravaah achaanak rukaawat ke saath sangat lakshan ke kisi bhi samooh ko teevr syndrome coronary kaha jaataa he
 Differential diagnoses include other catastrophic causes of chest pain such as pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, cardiac temponade due to pericardial effusion, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture
 Other non-objectionable variants include gastroesophageal reflux and Tiëtje syndrome
 teevr prayog ke saath judane main dil kaa daura kaa dar ucch hota he, yah maansik tanaav yaa shaareerik parishram hota he, khaskar vyakti ke saamaanya parishram kii tulana main yadi parishram teevr ho to
 maatraatmak, atyadhik parishram kii avadhi or antat swasthya laabh lagbhag 6 guna ucch dar ke rodhgalan ke saath shaareerik rup se feet logon ke saath jud jaataa he
 shaareerik rup se grast logon ke liye dar antar 35 guna adhik hota he
 is ghatana ke liye vruddhi hui ek tantra dhamni naadee dabaav khinch ko dekha gaya he or prayek dil kii dhadkan ke saath dhamniyon kaa vishram jise intravascular ultrasound ke saath dekha jaataa he, atheroma or pattica tuutan kii sambhaavna par "katarani tanaav" kii yantric vruddhi hoti he
 Acute acute infections such as pneumonia can increase myocardial infarction
 Chelamedophila pneumoniae is a more controversial link between infection and atherosclerosis
 While it has been demonstrated in intracellular organism atherosclerosis plaques, the evidence is inconclusive as it can be considered as a causal factor
 During treatment in patients with antibiotics it has been found that atherosclerosis does not reduce the risk of heart attacks or other coronary vascular attacks
 subah ke samay main dil ke daure ke maamalon main vruddhi hui he, vishesh rup se lagbhag 9 baje
 kuch jaanchakartaaon ne dhyaan diya he ki cirkidian maap ke anusaar platelets ko or adhik badhaane kii kshamta he, haalanki unhen karaniya sabit nahin kiya gaya he
 Risk factors for atherosclerosis Common factors for myocardial infarction are: in jokhim karkon main se kai parivartaneey he, isiilie kai dil ke daure ko ek swasth jivan style banaae rakhane ke dwaara roka ja saktaa he
 udhaaharan ke liye, shaareerik gatividhi, nune jokhim profil ke saath judaa he
 gaiyr parivartaneey jokhim karkon main aayu, ling or parivaar main samay se pehle dil ke daure hone vaale itihaas, jise anuvanshik pravriti ke rup main parilakshith kiya jaataa he, shaamil hai
 Socioeconomic factors such as low education and low income and unmarried cohabitation may contribute to the risk of MI
 To understand the results of epidemiological studies it is important to note that many factors associated with multiple MI increase its risk through other factors
 For example, the impact of education is partly based on its income and marital status
 ve mahilaayein jo kii sanyukt maukhik garbhanirodhak goli kaa upyog karti hai, unamem rodhgalan kaa jokhim bad jaataa he, vishesh kar jinamein anya jokhim kaarak vartmaan hote hai jaise dhumrapaan
 Inflammation is known to be an important step in the atherosclerotic plaque formation process
 C-reactive protein is a sensitive but non-specific marker for inflammation
 High CRP blood levels, especially those measured with sensitive examination, can recognize the risk of MI, as well as predict the risk of developing seizures and diabetes
 In addition, some medications for MI lower CRP levels
 The general population is advised against high use of CRP screening sensitivity as a means of screening, but it can be used at the discretion of the doctor Alternatively, in patients with pathological arterial coronary disease who already have other risk factors or Is known
 Whether atherosclerosis in the direct role of CRP plays remains uncertain

 Cyberterrorism can be defined in a more general way as any computer crime that targets computer networks without necessarily damaging real-world infrastructure, property life

 Its appearance varies depending on the motivation, target, method and centrality of computer use used in the attack
 sandarbh par nirbhar hokar, siburatankwaad, siblepraadh yaa saadhaaran aatankwaad ko kaaphi had tak aachhadit kar saktaa he
 If cyberterrorism is considered to be similar to traditional terrorism, it will only include attacks that can pose a threat to property or life and can be defined as leveraging victim's computers and information, in particular Through the Internet, so as to cause physical, actual loss or serious disruption of infrastructure
 kuch log hai jo kehete hai ki siburatankwaad kaa koi astitv hi nahin he or yah vastav main hekking yaa soochna yuddh kaa maamla he
 Considering the current attack and defensive techniques, they disagree on calling it terrorism, as it is unlikely to cause fear through electronic means, causing serious physical harm or killing the public
 ' If indeed a rigid definition is accepted, there will be no identifiable incident of cyberterrorism, despite substantial public concern

 The National Conference of State Legislatures, an organization of legislatures that is designed to help policymakers address issues such as the economy and the security of the homeland, defines cyberterrorism as: aatankwaadi samoohon or vyaktiyon dwaara apane agenda ko aage badhaane ke liye soochna praudyogiki kaa upyog

 Vin Schwartu and John Arcuilla are said to have made considerable financial gains by selling books depicting the plausible situations of violence allegedly perpetrated by cyberterrorism
 Many critics claim that this book is unrealistic in assessing whether the described attacks are possible
 Critics believe that there was a common thread in the lack of deniability in the entire cyberterrorism campaign; That is, when the predicted calamity fails to occur, it is a reflection of how lucky we were, rather than a criticism of the theory

 Egoistic individualism takes the form of Vaikasic individualism under these interpretations

 According to him, if man is naturally a social animal, then individualism should not be limited to self-interest but should be associated with fraternity cooperation and community life

 Individualism has to face criticisms as soon as the question of community comes up

 At the heart of these criticisms are mainly two questions: Should one be independent of the community and self-reliant? Will social unity not become impossible by doing this and the person will not become a victim of isolation and insecurity? paashchaatya darshan main vyaktvaad kii samasya pehle pahal sofist vichaarkon ke samay, paanchavon shatabdi isapurv ke aasapaas, utpann hui

 William Ow Oakham can be recalled in this context

 The idea is that while living in the same world, everyone has different views, all are individuals of their own kind

 But listening to his explanation, Duryodhana was very angry and said, "being the eldest son, my father Dhritarashtra had the right over this state, but after taking advantage of his darkness, uncle Pandu took the throne
 main maharaj dhritarashtra kaa jyeshtha putr hoon atah is rajya par meraa or keval meraa adhikaar he

 Shortly after this, Pandutnaya Arjuna also approached him with this task and seeing him slept, sat at his feet

 As soon as Arjuna said this, Duryodhana, who was sitting at the head, said, "O Krishna! i have also come to help you
 chunki main arjuna se pehle aayaa hoon isaliye sahaayta maangane kaa pehla adhikaar meraa he
 " duryodhana ke vachan sunakar bhagwaan krishna ne ghumkar duryodhana ko dekha or kaha, “he duryodhana! meri drushti arjuna par pehle padi he or tum kehete ho ki tum pehle aaye ho
 So i have to help both of you
 main tum donon main se ek ko apni puri sena de doongaa or duusare ke saath main swayan rahoonga

 " arjuna ne shri krishna ko apane saath rakhane kii ichha prakat kii jisase duryodhana prasann ho gaya kyonki vah to shri krishna kii vishaal sena lene ke liye hi aayaa tha
 In this way, Shri Krishna gave his army to Duryodhana for future war and became himself with the Pandavas
 duryodhana ke jane ke baad shri krishna ne arjuna se poocha, “he parth! mere yuddh nahin kaa nishchay ke baad bhi tumne kya soch kar mujhe maanga?” arjuna ne uttar diya, “bhagwan! meraa vishwaas he ki jahaan aap hai vahiin vijay he

 But the Bangla Encyclopedia edited by Nagendranath Vasu is the first modern encyclopaedia derived from Indian languages

 That is why, by appreciative patience, he immediately laid the foundation of the Hindi encyclopedia and completed it

 All of the newly invented innovations have been included and the essence of all the year-wise material collected by Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali writers along with research has become embedded in the Hindi dictionary
 hindi gyaanakosh kii rachana ke liye saikadon lekhak niyukt kiye gayi jo apane-2 vishyake visheshgy samajhe jate hai
 a committee of 33 Dhurandhar Scholars was appointed to edit their articles
