 Therefore, it is necessary to identify the insects correctly before using the virus

 According to a conference organized by Statistics Canada and The United States Censor Bureau titled "challenges of Meshing in the Ethnic World: Science, Politics, and Reality", "ethnicity is a fundamental factor in human life: it is an underlying fact of human experience
" " yadhyapi, maanavvigyaani fredrick barth or erik woolf jaise kai saamaajik vaigyanik jaateey pahchaan ko saarvbhaumik nahin maanate hai
 They consider it to be the product of a specific type of intergroup interaction, rather than considering ethnicity as an important trait inherent in a human group
 jo prakriyaayein is prakaar ke pahchaan ke udbhav kaa kaaran banati hai, unhen prajativrutt kehete hai
 Members of an ethnic group, overall, claim cultural continuity over time

 According to Thomas Hillland Eriksen, two different arguments dominated the study of ethnicity
 ek, "aadimavad" or "karnavaad" ke bich he
 In primitive terms, the participle assumes ethnic relations as a social bond, combined, externally provided, which may also be aggressive
 duusari ore karanvaadi drushtikon ke anusaar, jaateeyata mukhyatah ek raajnneetik ranneeti kaa ek tadarth tatv he, jise hit samoohon ke liye dhan, shakti yaa ohade main vruddhi jaise duusare darje ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sansaadhan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This debate is still used as an important reference in political science, although the views of most scholars remain between the two poles
 duusari bahes "rachnawad" or "tathvikwaad" ke bich he
 Constructivists often refer to national and ethnic identities as recent historical forces, even when identities are presented as archaic
 tathvikwaadi is tarah ke parichay ko saamaajik karrwai ke parinaam ke bajaay, saamaajik kartaaon ko paribhaashit karne vaale sattamulak shreniyon ke rup main dekhte hai
 According to Eriksen, these debates were sidelined, particularly by the efforts of scholars in anthropology to respond to the increasingly politicized forms of self-leadership by members of various ethnic groups and nations

 Cited in 18–24) haalanki, "jaateey" samooh ke aadhunik upyog, audyogic rajyon kaa adhinsth samoohon ke saath vibhinn prakaar kii muthbhedon ko darshata he, jaise ki apravasiyata or upnivesh vishay; "jaateey samooh" ko "raashtra" ke virodh main un logon ko sanderbhit karne ke uddeshy se khadaa kiya gaya, jinaki alag saanskrithik pahchaan hoti he or jo pravaas yaa vijay ke madhyam se, kisi videshi rajya ke adheen ho gaye hai
 The modern use of the term is relatively new — the term ethnic group was first used in 1851 - 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972
 oxford english dictionari kii aadhunik upyog sambandhi paribhaasha is prakaar he: a n Writing about the use of the English word "ethnic" in the common language of Great Britain and the United States, Wallman comments that is prakaar vartmaan bolchaal kii bhashaa main, aaj bhi "ethnic" or "ethnicity" shabd ke chaaron ore videshi logon, alpsankhyak muddon or jaateey sambandhon kaa ek gheraa bana hua he
 However, in the realm of social sciences, it is commonly used for all human groups who explicitly consider themselves culturally distinct and also perceived by others
 "ethnic group" shabd ko saamaajik vigyaan main laane vaale pratham vyaktiyon main german samajashastri maiks webar bhi shaamil hai, jo ise is rup main paribhaashit karte hai: Human groups who consider the subjective notion of their common origins to be due to the same physical structure or customs or both, or because of memories of colonization and migration; This assumption should be important for group formation; Furthermore, it does not matter whether a specific blood relationship exists
 webar kaa kahana he ki jaateey samooh cunstlish the, kyonki ve saajha gamineshaft main aatmanishth dharna par aadhaarit the
 Secondly, this belief in the shared gemineshaft did not create the group, but the group built the trust
 tisare, samooh gathan, shakti or rutabe par ekadhikaar karne kii hode kaa nateeja tha
 This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist notion of the time, according to which socio-cultural and behavioral differences of people arise from hereditary traits and tendencies derived from common lineages, which were then called "races"
 jaateeyata ke ek or prabhaavshaalee siddhanthapremi the fredrick barth, jinke 1969 se "ethnic grups and boundriz" ko 1980 or 1990 ke dashakon main saamaajik adhyayan main is shabd ke upyog ke prasar main sahaayak ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Barth also surpassed Weber in emphasizing the construction of the nature of ethnicity
 barth ke liye, donon bahya aropan or aantarik aatm-pahchaan ke dwaara nirantar rup se vaarta or punarvaata hi jaateeyata thi
 In Barth's opinion, ethnic group hierarchies are not disjunctive cultural solitude or logical a priori to which people naturally belong
 ve samskritiyon ke paribaddh tatv or jaateeyata ko aadimavaadi bandhan maanane vaali maanavshastreey dharanaon se dur rahanaa or use samoohon ke bich parthaky prishth par dhyaan sankendran ke saath pratisthapit karnaa chaahate the
 Therefore, the focus on mutual affiliation of ethnic identity is "ethnic groups and boundaries"
 barth likhte hai: " nirnayaatmak jaateey bhed gatishiltaa, sampark or jaankaree ke abhaav par nirbhar nahin he, lekin isamen apvarjan or samavesh kii saamaajik prakriyaayein shaamil hai jisase vyaktigat jivan itihaas ke dauraan unki sahabhaagita or sadsyta main badlaav ke baavjood, asatat shreniyon ko barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he
 " 1978 main, maanav vigyaani ronaald kohen ne daawa kiya ki "saamaajik vaigyanikon ke upyog main "jaateey samoohon" kii pahchaan, aksar deshi yatharth se adhik, galat label ko pratibimbit karti he: 


 the eponymous ethnic identity that we often adopt on the grounds given in literature, often arbitrarily, or even worse, is implicitly imposed
 is tarah se, unhone is sachai kii ore ingit kiya ki ek jaateey samooh kii pahchaan maanav vigyaniyon jaise bahari logon dwaara kiye jane par, us samooh ke aatm-pahchaan se bhinn ho sakati he
 He also pointed out that in the earlier decades of usage, the term ethnicity is often used in place of older terms such as "cultural" or "tribal" to refer to shared cultural systems and small groups with shared heritage, but that " Ethnicity "had the added advantage of being able to describe similarities in the identity systems of groups in both tribal and modern societies kohen ne yah bhi sujhaayaa ki "jati" pahchaan sambandhi daawey aksar upniveshvaadi prathaen hai or upniveshiy logon or raashtra-rajyon ke bich ke sambandhon kaa prabhaav hai
 Social scientists have therefore focused on how, when and why various indicators of ethnic identity become special
 atah, maanav vigyaani joan vincent ne gaur kiya ki jaateey simaaen aksar asthir charitra kii hoti hai
 Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is "an under-construction bifurcation series of interpolation and seclusion"
 They agree with Joan Vincent's observation that "ethnicity 


 can be narrowed or broadened, in terms of limits, in relation to specific needs of political mobilization
" yahi kaaran ho saktaa he ki kyon vansh kabhi-kabhi jaateeyata kaa ek suchak he or kabhi-kabhi nahin he: jaateeyata kaa koun-sa visheshak pramukh he or is par nirbhar karata he ki log jaateey simaaon kaa upar pravardhan kar rahe hai yaa neeche or ve unka upar pravardhan yaa neeche yah aam taur par raajnneetik sthiti par nirbhar karata he
 To avoid the problem of ethnic classification being defined by others labeling or self-identification, this measure suggested that these concepts such as "ethnic categories", "ethnic networks", and "ethnic communities" or "species" interchangeably Be separated from
 jaateeyata ko samajhane ke liye vibhinn saamaajik vaigyanikon dwaara kai alag-alag drushtikon kaa prayog kiya gaya he, jab unhone jaateeyata kii prakruti ko maanav jivan or samaaj main ek kaarak ke rup main samajhane kii koshish kii
 Examples of such methods are: Primitiveism, Elementalism, Sustainism, Constructivism, Modernism and Karanism
 webar se pehle, aksar nasl or jaateeyata ko ek hi chiz ke do pahaluon ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 The basic primitive understanding of ethnicity around and before 1900 was predominant, with cultural differences among people seen as the result of inherited traits and tendencies
 isi samay mastishk-vigyaan jaise "vigyaanon" ne daawa kiya ki ve vibhinn aabaadiyon ke bich saanskrithik or vyavhaarik gunon ko unki bahya bhautik sanrachana, jaise kii khopadi ke aakaar dwaara, sahasambaddh kar paane main sakasham he
 When Weber introduced ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity were divided from each other

 In 1950, unesco's statement "the Race Queschan", signed by some internationally renowned intellectuals at the time, suggested: "it is not necessary that national, religious, geographical, linguistic and cultural groups are racial groups
 Match with: And the cultural characteristics of such groups have no demonstrated genetic trait relationship with racial traits

 " 1982 main, america saanskrithik maanavvigyaani, chalis varshon ke nrivanshavigyaan shodh kaa sangrahan karte hue, yah tark dete hai ki nasleey or jaateey shreniyan pratikatmak suchak hai un vibhinn tareekon ke liye jo vishwa ke vibhinn hisson se logon ne vaishvik arthvyavastha main shaamil kiya he: According to Wolf, breeds were formed during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groups were formed and incorporated during the period of capitalist expansion
 jaateeyata aksar, saajha saanskrithik, bhashaai, vyavhaar-janya, yaa dharmik lakshanon kaa sanket detii he
 For example, to call themselves Jews or Arabs must immediately produce a put of linguistic, religious, cultural, and racial qualities that are considered the same in each ethnic category
 aisi vyapak jaateey shreniyon ko brihadjatiyata bhi kaha gaya he
 This distinguishes them from smaller, more subjective ethnic traits, often referred to as microethnicity
 kuch maamalon main, vishesh rup se jisamen antarrashtriya pravaas, yaa upniveshik vistaar shaamil he, jaateeyata rashtriyata se judy hoti he
 Anthropologists and historians, who follow the modernist understanding of ethnicity proposed by Ernest Gelner and Benedict Anderson, see nation and nationalism evolving with the modern state system in the seventeenth century
 unhone "nesan-stats" ke udbhav par samaapt kiya jisamen raashtra kii anumanik simaaen rajya simaaon ke saath samroop ho jaati hai
 Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, began to develop in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of the population as well as state boundaries more clearly and strictly
 Were being defined
 unnisvin sadi main, aadhunik rajyon ne saamanytah "rashtron" kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke daavon ke madhyam se vaidhata kii maang kii
 The nation-state, however, certainly includes populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another
 falswaroop, apvarjit samoohon ke sadsy, yaa to samanta ke aadhaar par shaamil kiye jane kii, yaa swarajya kii, kabhi-kabhi apane hi raashtra-rajya main purna raajnneetik algaav kii seemaa tak maang karenge
 Under these circumstances - when people migrate from one state to another, or conquer a state or colonize people beyond their national borders - ethnic groups formed by people whose identity with a nation Is, but they live in another state
 kabhi-kabhi jaateey samooh, desh yaa uske ghatakon dwaara pratikul drushtikon or karrwai ke adheen ho jate hai
 In the twentieth century, people began to argue that conflicts between ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state should be resolved in one of these two ways
 urgan havermas or brus bairi jaise kuch logon ne, yah tark diya he ki aadhunik rajyon kii vaidhata, swytt vyaktigat janata ke raajnneetik adhikaron kii dharna par aadhaarit honi chahie
 According to this view, the state should impose political and legal equality of all individuals rather than recognizing ethnic, national or racial identity
 charles tailor or vil camelikaa jaise dusron kaa tark he ki vyaktigat swytta kii dharna swayan main ek saanskrithik nirmaan he
 According to this view, states should understand their ethnic identity and develop procedures through which the special needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state

 Examples of focusing on the ethnic relations of society until the argument was ostensibly boycotted by history or historical context, resulted in support of nationalist goals
 Two periods, which are cited consistently as examples of this, are the consolidation and expansion of the German Empire in the nineteenth century and the Third Empire in the twentieth century
 Each promoted this all-ethnic idea according to which these governments were only occupying the lands on which the ethnic Germans had always been inhabited

 René Descartes, who devoted much of his time to the study of the pineal gland, called it "the seat of the soul"
 He believed that it is the confluence-place between the body and the intellect
 descartes dwaara aisa maanane ke kaaran se sambandhit praasangik uddhran he, My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed
 The reason i believe this is that i cannot find any part of the brain, except this, which is not double
 Since we see only one thing with two eyes, and hear only one voice with two ears, and in short have never more than one thought at a time, it must necessarily be the case that the impressions which enter by the two eyes or by the two ears, and so on, unite with each other in some part of the body before being considered by the soul
 Now it is impossible to find any such place in the whole head except this gland; moreover it is located in the most suitable possible place for this purpose, in the middle of all the concavities; barook di spinoja ne baad main iskaa khandan kiya: For he maintained, that the soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of the brain, namely, to that part called the pineal gland, by the aid of which the mind is enabled to feel all the movements which are set going in the body, and also external objects, and which the mind by a simple act of volition can put in motion in various ways 


 Such is the doctrine of this illustrious philosopher; it is one which, had it been less ingenious, i could hardly believe to have proceeded from so great a man
 Indeed, i am lost in wonder, that a philosopher, who had stoutly asserted, that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow from self-evident premisses, and would affirm nothing which he did not clearly and distinctly perceive, and who had so often taken to task the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through occult qualities, could maintain a hypothesis, beside which occult qualities are commonplace
 What does he understand, i ask, by the union of the mind and the body? "piniyal-aankh" kii avadharana francisi lekhak jarges batel ke darshan kaa centre rahi he, jise vidwaan sahityakar denis holier ne apane adhyayan against architekchar main savistaar vishleshit kiya

 All such medicines and systems that can relieve pain are called Vednahar or analgesics
 bahut si aushadhiyon main anyaanya gunon ke saath-saath pidapharan ke gun bhi hote hai

 The word is derived from Algisis, which means agony
 pidapharan main vyathaa kaa abhaav athwa lop ho jaataa he
 There can be two reasons for the absence of pain: first, in which the flow of consciousness of pain is stopped in the pulse by any medicine or any other action and it cannot reach the brain and second, in which the brain itself experiences the pain due to some reason Could
 agar sharir ke keval nishchit ang kii naadiyon main pidaa-haran kiya jaay to ise sthanik samvedanhaari kaha jaataa he
 But if the whole body is painless by any other system of medicine, then it is called universal pain
 pidaa ke bahut se kaaran hote hai
 There are two major parts to these reasons: first in which physiology and secondly in which the basis of psyche is
 isliye jin aushadhiyon tathaa pranaaliyon se praani kii shaaririk kriyaaon, yaa maansik avasthaa main, her pher laayaa jaataa he, ve pidaapaharak ho sakate hai; arthath maansik evam shaareerik avasthaa ke parivartan se pidaa main, evam pidaapaharak aushadhiyon ke asar main, parivartan aa jaataa he
 Different consciousnesses, such as tactile consciousness, heat consciousness and pain consciousness reach the spinal cord from every part of the body through sensory channels
 isliye in naadiyon ke rogon main sabhi chetnaayen lupt ho jaati hai
 But after entering the sushumna scandal, the gyanantantu who carry these consciousnesses get separated in the sushumna scandal
 isliye kuch rogon main sari chetnaaon par ek-sa hi asar nahin hota, jaise siringo maayaliya main sparsh chetana vartmaan rahati he, kintu pidachetana evam taapchetana apekshit yaa lupt ho jaati he

 jinhen madhyakaal ke santon ne samanvit karne kii safal koshish kii or sabhi sampradaayon ko paraspar ashrith bataaya
 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih

 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi

 hindu dharm manyataon main paanch pramukh devtaa poojaneey he
 These are different forms and powers of one God

 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith
 There is a great devotion among our countrymen towards pilgrimages
 isliye shankaracharya ne in pitho kii sthapana karke deshavaasiyon ko puure bharat ke darshan karne kaa sahaj avasar de diya
 These four shrines are called Char Dham
 logon kii manyata he ki jo in chaaron dham kii yatra kar letaa he, uskaa jivan dhanya ho jaataa he
 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities
 garbhagrih main ishtdev kii murti pratishthit hoti he
 The temples are the best symbols of ancient and medieval Indian art
 kai mandiron main har saal lakhon tirthayatri aate hai
 Most Hindus consider the four Shankaracharyas to be the supreme religious leaders of Hinduism

 inhone sabhi dharmon kii ekta par jor diya
 Since childhood, he believed that one can have darshan of God, so to achieve God, he spent a life of hard work and devotion
 swami ramakrishna maanavtaa ke pujari the
 As a result of spiritual practice, he came to the conclusion that all the religions of the world are true and there is no difference among them
 ve ishwar tak pahunchne ke bhinn-bhinn saadhan maatr hai
 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the saint of human values, was born on 18 February 1836 in Kamarpukur village in Bengal province
 inke bachapan kaa naam gadadhar tha
 Father's name was Khudiram and Mataji's name was Chandramanidevi
 unke bhakton ke anusaar ramakrishna ke mata pita ko unke janm se pehle hi alokik ghatnaon or drishyon kaa anubhav hua tha
 His father Khudiram had a dream in Gaya in which he saw that God Gadadhar told him that he would be born as his son
 unki mata chandramani devi ko bhi aisa ek anubhav hua tha unhone shiv mandir main apane garbh main roshni pravesh karte hue dekha
 Everyone was mesmerized by his childlike simplicity and enchanted smile
 saat varsh kii alpaayu main hi gadadhar ke sir se pita kaa saaya uth gaya
 Maintaining the whole family became difficult in such an adverse situation
 aarthik kathinaaiyaan ain
 The courage of the boy Gadadhar did not diminish
 inke bade bhai ramkumar chattopadhyaay kalakatta main ek paathshaala ke sanchaalak the
 They took Gadadhar with them to Kolkata
 ramakrishna kaa antarman atyant nishchal, sahaj or vinayashil tha
 He was far from narrow
 apane kaaryon main lage rahete the
 Even after continuous efforts, Ramakrishna's mind could not be engaged in studies and teaching
 1855 main ramakrishna paramhans ke bade bhai ramkumar chattopadhyaay ko dakshineshwar kaali mandir ke mukhya pujari ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Ramakrishna and his nephew Hridaya assisted Ramkumar
 ramakrishna ko devi pratimaa ko sajaane kaa daayitv diya gaya tha
 After the death of Ramkumar in 1856, Ramakrishna was ordained as a priest in the Kali temple
 ramkumar kii mrityu ke baad shri ramakrishna zyaada dhyaan magn rahane lage
 He began to see the idol of Kali Mata as his mother and the mother of the universe
 kaha jaataa hai kii shri ramakrishna ko kaali mata ke darshan bramhand kii mata ke rup main hua tha
 Ramakrishna describes it as saying, "the house, the gate, the temple and everything became invisible, as if there was nothing! And i saw the ocean of light without an infinite arrow, it was the ocean of consciousness
" jis disha main bhi maine dur dur tak jahaan bhi dekha bas ujjwal lehren dikhaai de rahi thi, jo ek ke baad ek ,meri taraf aa rahi thi
 Rumor had spread that Ramakrishna's mental balance had deteriorated due to spiritual practice in Dakshineswar
 ramakrishna kii mata or unke bade bhai rameshwar ramakrishna kaa vivaah karwaane kaa nirnay liya
 He believed that upon getting married, Gadadhar's mental balance would be corrected, due to the responsibilities that came after marriage, his focus would shift from spiritual practice
 ramakrishna ne khud unhen yah kaha ki ve unke liye kanya jayrambati main ramachandra mukherjee ke ghar paa sakate hai
 In 1859, 5-year-old Shardamani Mukhopadhyay and 23-year-old Ramakrishna were married
 vivaah ke baad sharada jayrambati main rahati thi or 18 varsh ke hone par ve ramakrishna ke paas dakshineshwar main rahane lagi
 Ramakrishna then lived the life of a monk
 kaalaantar main bade bhai bhi chal based
 He was distressed by this incident
 sansar kii anityata ko dekhakar unke man main vairaygy kaa udai hua
 Even without noticing from inside, Sri Ramakrishna started worshiping the temple and praying
 dakshineshwar sthit panchvati main ve dhyanamgn rahane lage
 He was distraught to see God
 log unhe pagal samajhane lage
 Worried over his son's frenzied state of mind, Chandramani Devi married Gadadhar to Sarada Devi
 iske baad bhairavi brahmani kaa dakshineshwar main aagaman hua
 He taught them Tantra
 madhubhav main avasthaan karte hue thakur ne shrikrishna kaa darshan kiya
 He gained the knowledge of Advaita Vedanta from Totapuri Maharaj and attained the state of life
 sanyas grahan karne ke vaad unka nayaa naam hua shriramkrishna paramhans
 After this, he also practiced Islam and Christianity
 samay jaise-jaise vyateet hota gaya, unke kathor aadhyatmik abhyaason or siddhiyon ke samachar teji se failane lage or dakshineshwar kaa mandir udyaan sheeghra hi bhakton evam bhramanshil sanyasiyon kaa priy ashrayasthaan ho gaya
 Some great scholars and famous Vaishnavas and tantric seekers like Pt
 Narayana Shastri, Pt
 Padmalochan Tarakalakar, Vaishnavacharan and Gaurikant Tarakbhushan etc
 kept getting spiritual inspiration from him
 vah sheeghra hi tatkaaleen suvikhyath vichaarkon ke ghanishtha sampark main aae jo bengal main vichaaron kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Names of Keshavchandra Sen, Vijayakrishna Goswami, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar can be named in these
 iske atirikt saadhaaran bhakton kaa ek doosraa varg tha jiske sabase mahatvapurn vyakti ramchandra dutt, girishchandra ghosh, balram bose, mahendranath gupt or durgacharan naag the
 Swami Vivekananda was his supreme disciple
 ramakrishna paramhans jivan ke antim dinon main samadhi kii sthiti main rahane lage
 Therefore, the body started to relax
 shishyon dwaara swasthya par dhyaan dene kii prarthana par agyanta jaanakar hans dete the
 His disciples used to call him by the name of Thakur
 ramakrishna ke parampriy shishy vivekananda kuch samay himalay ke kisi ekaant sthaan par tapasya karnaa chaahate the
 When he went to the Guru to take this command, Ramakrishna said - Watts the people around us are suffering from hunger
 chaaron ore agyaan kaa andhera chaaya he
 People here keep on crying and shouting and you should be immersed in the joy of samadhi in a cave in the Himalayas
 kya tumhaari aatma sweekaaregi? isse vivekananda daridr narayan kii seva main lag gayi
 Ramakrishna was a great yogi, high-class seeker and thinker
 seva path ko ishwariya, prashast maanakar anekta main ekta kaa darshan karte the
 Wanted to protect society from service
 gale main sujan ko jab doctoron ne cancer bataakar samadhi lene or vaartalap se manaa kiya tab bhi ve muskaraaye
 Vivekananda kept on getting treatment even after stopping the treatment
 chikitsa ke vabjood unka swasthya bigadataa hi gaya
 Finally that day of sorrow has come
 1886 i
 16 agast savera hone ke kuch hi vakt pehle anandaghan vigrah shriramkrishna is nashwar deh ko tyaag kar mahasamadhi dwaara swa-swarup main leen ho gayi
 Ramakrishna used to teach people through short stories
 kalakatta ke buddhijiviyon par unke vichaaron ne jabardast prabhaav choda tha ; halaki unki shikshaayen aadhuniktaa or raashtra ke azaadi ke bare main nahin thi
 His spiritual movement indirectly served to increase the feeling of nationalism in the country as his teachings negate casteism and religious bias
 ramakrishna ke anusaar hi manushya jivan kaa sabase bada lakshya hai
 Ramakrishna used to say that kamini-kanch is the biggest hindrance to attaining God
 ramakrishna sansar ko maaya ke rup main dekhte the
 According to him Avidya Maya represents the dark powers of creation, it puts human at the lower level of consciousness
 yah shaktiyaan manushya ko janm or mrityu ke chakra main bandhane ke liye zimmedaar hai
 The same Vidya Maya are responsible for the good powers of creation
 yah manushya ko chetan ke unche str par le jaati hai

 Devanagari is an Indian script in which many Indian languages and many foreign languages are written
 yah baayen se daayen likhi jaati he
 It is identified by a horizontal line known as 'shirirekha'
 sanskrit, pali, hindi, marathi, konkani, sindhi, kashmiri, dogri, khas, nepal bhashaa, tamaque bhashaa, gadhwali, bodo, angika, magahi, bhojpuri, maithili, santhali aadi bhashaayen devanagari main likhi jaati hai
 Additionally, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bishnupuria Manipuri, Romani and Urdu languages are also written in Devanagari in some cases
 devanagari vishwa main sarvaadhik prayukt lipiyon main se ek he
 Like most languages, Devanagari is written from left to right
 prayek shabd ke upar ek rekha khinchi hoti he ise shirorekha kehete hai
 Devanagari has evolved from the Brahmi script
 yah ek dhvanyatmak lipi he jo prachlit lipiyon main sabase adhik vaigyanik he
 From this the scientific and comprehensive script is probably only Adhva script
 bharat kii kai lipiyaan devanagari se bahut adhik milti-julati hai, jaise- bangla, gujarati, gurumukhi aadi
 With the help of computer programs, interchange of Indian scripts has become very easy
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke kisi bhi shabd yaa dhwani ko devanagari lipi main jyon kaa tyon likhaa ja saktaa he or phir likhe paath ko lagbhag 'hu-ba-hu' uccharan kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki roman lipi or anya kai lipiyon main sambhav nahin he, jab tak ki unka vishesh maanakeekaran na kiya jaye, jaise itrans yaa ieesti
 It has a total of 52 letters, with 14 vowels and 38 consonants
 aksharon kii kram vyavastha bhi bahut hi vaigyanik he
 Classification of vowel-consonant, soft-hard, hypnotic-hypnotic, resonant-antasthe-heat, etc
 are also scientific
 ek mat ke anusaar devnagar me prachlan ke kaaran iskaa naam devanagari padaa
 The indications of many scripts in India and Asia are different from Devanagari, but the pronunciation and alphabet are the same as Devanagari, because they all originated from the Brahmi script
 isliye in lipiyon ko paraspar aasaani se lipyantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Devanagari is simple in terms of writing, beautiful in terms of beauty and legible in reading
 bhartiya ankon ko unki vaigyaniktaa ke kaaran vishwa ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya he
 The use of the name Devanagari or Nagari began with "why" and what was its etymological tendency - it is not yet completely certain
 'nagar' apbhransh yaa gujarati "nagar" brahmanon se uskaa sambandh bataaya gaya he
 But in the absence of strong evidence, this opinion is doubtful
 dakshin main iskaa pracheen naam "nandinagari" tha
 May be "nandinagar" is a locative and this script has something to do with it
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki "nagar" jan isamen likhaa karte the, at: "nagari" abhidhaan padaa or jab sanskrit ke granth bhi isamen likhe jane lage tab "devanagari" bhi kaha gaya
 Symbols or triangles, chakras, etc
 used in the worship of gods were called "devanagar"
 kalantar main naam ke prathamaksharon kaa unase bodh hone laga or jis lipi main unako sthaan mila- vah 'devanagari' yaa 'nagari' kahi gai
 At the core of all these aspects is the predominance of imagination, conclusive evidence is unavailable
 bharat devanagari lipi kii kshamta se shatabdiyon se parichit rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Dwarka Prasad Saxena, the first use of Devanagari script is found in the inscription of Naib Jayabhatta of Gujarat
 aathvin shatabdi main chitrakoot, naveen main baroda ke dhruvaraj bhi apane rajyadeshon main is lipi kaa upyog kiya karte the
 The Samagadha Tamrapat of Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga of 758 AD is found on which Devanagari is inscribed
 shilaharvansh ke ganndraditya ke utkeern lekh kii lipi devanagari he
 Its time is eleventh century, Cholaraja Rajendra coins of this time have been found on which the Devanagari script is inscribed
 rashtrakut raja indraraj ke lekh main bhi devanagari kaa vyavhaar kiya he
 The donation letter of Pratihara king Mahendrapal is also in Devanagari script
 kaningham kii pustak main sabase pracheen musalamaanon sikke ke rup main mahmud gajnabi dwaara chalaaye gaye chaandi ke sikke kaa varnan he jis par devanagari lipi main sanskrit ankit he
 The Devanagari script is treated with the idol of Lakshmi on the coins of Muhammad Vinsam
 shamshuddin iltutamish ke sikkon par bhi devanagari ankit he
 Sanuddin Ferozeshah I, Jalaluddin Razia, Bahram Shah, Alaluddin Marudshah, Naseeruddin Mahmood, Muizuddin, gayasuddin Balvan, Muizuddin Kaikubad, Jalaluddin Hero Sani, Alauddin Mahmad Shah etc
 have inscribed Devanagari letters on their coins
 akbar ke sikkon par devanagari main ‘ram‘ siya kaa naam ankit he
 Gaiyasuddin Tughlaq, Sher Shah Suri, Islam Shah, Muhammad Adilshah, Ghiyasuddin Ibj, Ghiyasuddin Sani etc
 followed the same tradition
 brahmi or devanagari lipi : bhashaa ko lipiyon main likhane kaa prachlan bharat main hi shuru hua
 Sumerian, Babylonian and Greek people learned it from India
 prachinkaal main brahmi or devanagari lipi kaa prachlan tha
 Other scripts around the world originated from Brahmi and Devanagari scripts
 brahmi lipi ek pracheen lipi he jisase kai asian lipiyon kaa vikaas hua he
 Brahmi, like Kharoshthi, was spread throughout Asia
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki brahmi lipi 10,000 saal puraani he lekin yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah lipi usase bhi zyada puraani he
 Emperor Ashoka also adopted this script: The great emperor Ashoka named the Brahmi script as Dhammalipi
 brahmi lipi ko devanagari lipi se bhi pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is said to be a script derived from the ancient indus-saraswati script
 hadappa samskruti ke log sindhu lipi ke alaav is lipi kaa bhi istemaal karte the, tab sanskrit bhashaa ko bhi isi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 In linguistic terms, Devanagari script is considered as alphabetic script
 lipi ke vikassopanon kii drushti se "chitratmak", "bhavatmak" or "bhavchitratmak" lipiyon ke ananthar "aksharatmak" str kii lipiyon kaa vikaas mana jaataa he
 The alphabetic state developed after the alphabetic state of the script due to the opinion of Westerners and many Indian linguists
 sabase viksit avasthaa maani gai he dhvanyatmak lipi kii
 "devanagari" is said to be alphabetical because its characters are letters - vowels and consonants
 "k", "kha" aadi vyanjan saswar hai- akaryukt hai
 They are not only sounds but are aloud
 at: greek, roman aadi varnmalas hai
 But here it is to be kept in mind that the "panini" of the consonants in the sounds of the "brahmi" or "bharati" alphabet of India has been explained by "patanjali" in the 14 formulas of Varnasammanaya
 Is that the use of the vowel "akaar" conjugated in consonants is for the purpose of pronunciation only
 vah tatvat: varna kaa ang nahin he
 Thinking from this point of view it can be said that the alphabet of this script is essentially phonetic, not alphabetic
 devanagari kii varnmaala main 12 swar or 34 vyanjan hai
 a letter is formed by a combination of zero or one or more consonants and a vowel
 nimnlikhit swar aadhunik hindi ke liye diye gayi hai
 Their pronunciation is slightly different in Sanskrit
 sanskrit main i do swaron kaa yugma hota he or "a-i" yaa "aa-i" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Similarly, au is spoken like "a-u" or "a-u"
 iske alaava hindi or sanskrit main ye varnakshar bhi swar maane jate hai : When no vowel is used, 'A' is considered there
 swar ke na hone ko halant athwa viraam se darshaya jaataa he
 Such as KGGH
 hindi bhashaa main mukhyat: arabi or farsi bhashaaon se aaye shabdon ko devanagari main likhane ke liye kuch varnon ke neeche nukta lage varnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 But in Hindi also most people do not use nuktas
 iske alaava sanskrit, marathi, nepali evam anya bhashaaon ko devanagari main likhane main bhi nukton kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Th is mainly used in the hill languages, as in Dogri the word for "tear" is "athru"
 hindi main d or dh vyanjan farsi yaa arabi se nahin liye gayi hai, na hi ye sanskrit main paye jaye hai
 In fact, they are the changed forms of ordinary s and d in Sanskrit
 devanagari ank nimna rup main likhe jate hai : In the Devanagari script, two consonants are spelled as follows: brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main devanagari lipi sabase adhik sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detii he
 Devanagari also supports conjuncts of more than 2 dishes
 chhandas font devanagari main bahut sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detaa he
 Some of the Devanagari characters used in earlier times are different from modern Devanagari
 1
kul milakar 403 tip hone ke kaaran tankan, mundran main kathinaayee
 2
 Use the outline for unnecessary embellishments
 3
anaavashyak varna — aaj inhen koi shuddh uccharan ke saath uccharit nahin kar paata
 4
sequential characters 5
samroop varna 
 6
 There is no fixed arrangement for combining the letters
 7
anuswaar evam anunasikta ke prayog main ekarupata kaa abhaav
 
 Not critical writing because writing has to be repeated
 9

with the amount of the letter writing on the first letter after the accented letter
 acharya vinoba bhaave sansar kii anek lipiyon ke jaankaar the
 He had a clear belief that Devanagari script is the most scientific script in the world, not only in India
 agar bharat kii sab bhashaaon ke liye iskaa vyavhaar chal pade to saare bhartiya ek duusare ke bilkul najadik aa jaaenge
 In the unity of Hindustan, Devanagari script can be more useful than Hindi itself
 anant shaynam ayangaar to dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon ke liye bhi devanagari kii sambhaavna sweekaar karte the
 Seth Govindas was in favor of declaring it a national script
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki bharat main anekon bhashaayen hona koi samasya nahin he jabaki unki lipiyaan alag-alag hona bahut badi samasya he
 Gandhiji printed a Gujarati language book in Devanagari script in 1940 and stated that its dream is that every language emanating from Sanskrit should be scripted in Devanagari
 isi prakaar vinoba bhaave kaa vichaar tha ki- The area affected by Buddhist culture is not new to Nagari
 china or japan chitralipi kaa vyavhaar karte hai
 Due to the large number of these pictures, it is very difficult to learn the language
 devvani kii vahika hone ke naate devanagari bharat kii simaaon se baahar nikalakar china or japan ke liye bhi samuchit vikalp de sakati he
 People of Indian origin are familiar with Devanagari wherever they live in the world, especially people from Mauritius, Suriname, Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad, Tubago, etc
 is tarah devanagari lipi na keval bharat ke andar saare praantvaasiyon ko prem-bandhan main baandhakar simolanghan kar dakshin-purv asia ke puraane vrihattar bhartiya parivaar ko bhi ‘bahujan hitay, bahujan sukhaay‘ anupranit kar sakati he tathaa vibhinn deshon ko ek adhik sucharu or vaigyanik vikalp pradaan kar ‘vishwa nagari‘ kii padavi kaa daawa ikkisvin sadi main kar sakati he
 The spread on it will not be the medium of scriptural imperialism and exploitation but the conductor of lofty human values like truth, non-violence, renunciation, self-control, from unrest to sata, light from tamas and immortality from death
 duniya kii kai bhashaaon ke liye devanagari sabase acha vikalp ho sakati he kyonki yah yah bolne kii puri aazaadee detaa he
 This cannot happen in any other script of the world
 indonesia, vietnam, africa aadi ke liye to yahi sabase sahi rahegaa
 Looking at Ashtadhyayi, one can understand that there is no better script in the world
 agar duniya pakshpatarahit ho to devanagari hi duniya kii sarvamaanya lipi hogi kyonki yah purnat: vaigyanik he
 Deoghari script based on Devanagari has been proposed for effective solution to the spelling problem in English language
 vistrut lekh devanagari kii vaigyaniktaa dekhen
 Just as the world accepted the Indian numerals due to their scientificity, in the same way, Devanagari will one day become a world class due to its scientificness
 devanagari kaa vikaas us yug main hua tha jab lekhan haath se kiya jaataa tha or lekhan ke liye shilaayein, taadptr, charmpatr, bhojaptr, tamrapatr aadi kaa hi prayog hota tha
 But writing technology has developed a lot and through the printing press, typewriter etc
 it has reached the computer age where it has become possible to write even by speaking

 For this reason, efforts were made to improve or standardize from time to time in Devanagari

 The role of many institutional efforts has also been very important in the development of Devanagari
 1935 main hindi sahitya sammelan ne nagari lipi sudhaar samiti ke madhyam se barhakhadi or shirorekha se sambandhit sudhaar kiye
 Similarly, in 1947, a committee constituted under the chairmanship of Narendra Dev gave important suggestions related to twelvekhadi, quantity arrangement, Anusvara and Nunasik

 Brother-in-law is at home! Is an Indian serial
 iskaa prasaaran and tivi par 2 march 2015 se somvaar se shuukravaar raat 10:30 baje se hua
 This story is about two neighboring families of Kanpur
 donon hi parivaar ke pati ko duusare kii patni se pyaar ho jaataa he or vah unase milane ke liye bahaane talash karte rahete hai
 He proves to be all wrong ways and he keeps getting trapped in all of them
 har episod main isaki alag kahani hoti hai jisame manmohan tiwari kachche baniyine ke vyapaaree he, jabaki vibhuti mishra berozegaar pati he jinaki patni anitha mishra grouming claces lekar ghar chalati he
 Manmohan Tiwari's wife is a domestic woman who is engaged in household chores
 saarvajanik jivan main sweekrut mulyon ke viruddh aacharan ko bhrasht aacharan samajha jaataa he 
 It is associated with economic offenses in common life
 aam taur par sarkari satta or sansadhano ke nijee faayde ke liye kiye jane vaale beja istemaal ko bhrashtachar kii sangya di jaati he
 a second, more comprehensive definition is that corruption is a flagrant violation of any established and accepted standard of private or public life
 vibhinn maanakon or deshkal ke hisaab se bhi isamen tabdiliyaan hoti rahati hai
 For example, commissioning of defense deals in India is illegal, hence it is considered a corruption and anti-national act and is called a scam
 lekin duniya ke kai viksit deshon main yah ek jaays vyapaarik karrwai he
 The differences between cultures also complicate the question of corruption
 unnisvin sadi ke dauraan bharat par aupniveshik shashan thopane vaale angrez apni victorian naitikta ke aaine main bhartiya yon-vyavhaar ko duracharan ke rup main dekhte the
 Whereas India of the second half of the twentieth century can be considered a victim of sexual purity in the eyes of any European
 bhrashtachar kaa mudda ek aisa raajnneetik prashn he jiske kaaran kai baar na keval sarkarein badal jaati hai
 Rather it has also been the carrier of huge historical changes
 roman catholic carch dwaara anugrah ke badale shulk lene kii pratha ko martin luther dwaara bhrashtachar kii sangya di gayi thi
 The Christian religious reforms came out of the religious struggle against it
 parinamswaroop protestant mat kaa janm hua
 This historical change formed the basis for the formulation of secularism
 samaaj-vaigyanik vimarsh main bhrashtachar se sambandhit samaj ke bare main koi ekta nahin he
 Scholars with an anti-capitalist view believe that market-based systems run on the principle of 'grad is Good', so corruption is bound to increase under them
 duusari taraf khule samaaj kii vakaalat karne vaale or marxvad virdohi buddhijivi sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee vaali vyavasthaaon main communist party ke adhikariyon dwaara bade paimaane par rajya ke sansadhano ke durupyog or aam janata ke saadhaaran jivan kii keemat par khud ke liye aramtalab zindagi kii guarantee karne kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 The second understanding of corruption depends on the amount and scope of interference by the state institution in the economic activities of the people
 bahut adhik tex vasuulne vaale nizaam ke tahat kar-chori ko saamaajik jivan kii ek majaburi kii tarah liya jaataa he
 One theory from this is that the less laws and controls there are, the less the need for corruption
 is drushtikon ke paksh purv soviet sangh or china samate samaajawaadee deshon kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he jahaan rajya kii sanstha ke sarvyaapee hone ke baavjood bahut badi maatra main bhrashtachar kii maujuudagi rahati he
 To justify the equation of 'greater control - more corruption', the example of alcoholism in America in the thirties is also cited, which led to an unprecedented boom in organized and economic corruption
 saath or sattar ke dashak main kuch vidwaanon ne avikisit deshon ke aarthik vikaas ke liye ek seemaa tak bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii maujuudagi ko uchit qaraar diya tha
 Arnold J
 Theorists such as Heidenheimer said that traditional and socially stable societies rarely face the problem of corruption
 lekin tej rakrataar se hone vaale udyogikaran or aabaadi kii awaazahi ke kaaran samaaj sthapit maanakon or mulyon ko chhodte chale jate hai
 As a result, a large scale corruption phenomenon arises
 sattar ke dashak main hidanhimer kii yah siddhant khaasaa prachlit tha
 Instead of advocating anti-corruption policies and programs, Heidenheimer concluded that as the prosperity in society increases, the prestige of the middle class will increase and urban civilization and way of life will develop, this problem automatically came under control Will go
 lekin sattar ke dashak main hi europe or america main bade-bade raajnneetik or aarthik ghotaalon kaa pardaafaash hua
 Among these were the Watergate Scandal in America and the Paul's Affair in Britain
 in ghotaalon ne madhyavargeey naagarik gunon ke vikaas main yakeen rakhane vaale hidanhimer ke is siddhant ke atiashawad kii hawa nikaal di
 It was during the sixties that some other scholars also argued on the lines of Heidenheimer that nothing would be gained by making ethical interpretations of the problem of corruption
 inamen semual hantington pramukh the
 These social scientists believed that corruption is not harmful in every situation
 vikasshil deshon main vah mashin main tel kii bhoomika nibhaataa he or logon ke haath main karch karne laayak paisa aane se upabhokta kranti ko gati milti he
 But a 1969 report issued by the World Bank on corruption in Africa shook this notion
 is rapat ke baad bhrashtachar ko ek anivaary buraai or aarthik vikaas main baadhak ke taur par dekha jane laga
 The World Bank started campaigning against corruption
 is vimarsh kaa ek parinaam yah bhi niklaa ki samaaj-vaigyanik apekshaakrit kam viksit deshon main bhrashtachar kii samasya ke prati zyaada dilchaspee dikhaane lage
 In developed countries, the problem of corruption began to be largely ignored
 yah drushtikon bhoomandaleekaran ke daur main or prabal hua
 Lending international financial institutions, the developed countries dominating them, and large corporations tried to guarantee that the aid they provided was properly utilized
 iskaa parinaam 1993 main transperency international kii sthapana main niklaa jisamen vishwa bank ke kai purv adhikari sakriy the
 After this, comparative studies of corruption started through surveys and statistics
 lekin in prayaason ke parinaam kisi bhi tarah se santoshjanak nahin maane ja sakate
 In 2007, Daniel Treesman called 'what Have We Learned About the Causes of Corruption from Ten Years of Cross National Imperial Research?' The result has come from writing that mature liberal democracies and market-oriented societies are relatively less corrupt
 unke ulat tel niryaat karne vaale desh, adhik niyantrankari kanoon banane vaale or mudrasphiti ko kaabo main na karne vaale desh kahin adhik bhrasht hai
 Obviously these conclusions are not new from any angle
 haal hi main jin deshon main aarthik ghotaalon kaa pardaafaash hua he unamem chote-bade or viksit-aviksit yani har tarah ke desh hai
 Going beyond these conflicting views of corruption as convenient and harmful, it has not yet formulated any direct relationship with economic growth
 udaahranarth, asia ke do deshon, dakshin korea or philippines, main bhrashtachar ke suchakank bahut unche hai
 However, the rate of economic growth in Korea is significant, while in the Philippines it is low
