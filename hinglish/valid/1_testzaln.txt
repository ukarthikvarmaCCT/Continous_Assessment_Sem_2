 Engineering is the science and business that offers practical solutions to the problems faced by man in meeting diverse needs
 iske liye vah ganitiya, bhautik va prakritik vigyaanon ke gyanrashi kaa upyog karti he
 Engineering produces physical goods and services; Develops and controls industrial processes
 iske liye vah takneekee maanakon kaa prayog karte hue vidhiyaan, dizin or vinirdesh pradaan karti he
 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ingénierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'
 nikat bhootkaal main abhiyantriki shabd kaa jo arth kosh main miltaa tha vah sankshep main is prakaar bataaya ja saktaa he ki But this limited definition could no longer run
 abhiyantriki shabd kaa arth ab ek ore nabhikeey abhiyantriki ke ucch vaigyanik or pravidhik kshetra se lekar maanviya gunon se sambandhit vishyon, jaise shramik niyantran prabandheey kaaryakshmata, samay or gati kaa adhyayan ityadi, anek praayogic vigyaanon ke vistrut kshetra ko ghere hue he
 Thus it would be more appropriate to define engineering as "it is the science and art of efficient use of natural means for the physical service of man"
 aitihaasik rup se ejiniyari kaa upyog sabase pehle sena or sainik kaaryon main hua
 After this, when it started being used for civil works, the new branch was named - 'civil Engineering'
 samay ke saath ejiniyari ke anya kshetron kaa vikaas hua jinaki prakruti civil ejiniyari se bhi alag thi or unhen 'yantric ejiniyari', 'vaidyut ejiniyari' aadi naam diya gaya
 Civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering are the traditional branches of engineering
 khanan ejiniyari, dhaatukarm or khan surveykshan kaa bhi aitihaasik mahatv he
 Architecture or architecture combines engineering and visualization
 abhiyantriki kii anek shakhaon main, jaise jaanapad athwa asainik, yantric, vidyutiya, saamudr, khanijasambandhi, rasinic, nabhikeey aadi main, kuch mahatvapurn kaary anveshan, prarachan, utpaadan, prachlan, nirmaan, vikray, prabandh, shiksha, anusandhan ityadi hai
 In order to get a proper knowledge of the vast area covered by the word engineering, it would be enlightening to give the names of the subjects under its various branches as examples
 jaanapad athwa asainik abhiyantriki ke antargat agralikhit vishay he : sadaken, rail, nautaran maarg, saamudr abhiyantriki, band, apaksharannirodh, baadh niyantran, naunivesh, pattan, jalawaahiki, jalavidyutsakti, jalavigyaan, sinchai, bhumisudhar, nadiniyantran, nagarpalika abhiyantriki, sthavar sampada, moolyankan, shilpabhiyantriki, purvanirmit bhawan, dhvanivigyaan, sanvathan, nagar tathaa gram pariyojna, jalsangrahan or vitaran, jalotsaaran, mahapvahan, kooday-kachade kaa apvahan, sanrachnik abhiyantriki, pul, kancreet, jaetvik sanrachanaayen, purvapratibalit kancreet, neenv, sanjan, bhusurvekshan, saamudrapareekshan, photography surveykshan, parivahan, bhuvigyaan, dravayantriki, pratikruti, vishleshan, mrudayantriki, jalsravi staron main chikani mitti pravisht karnaa, shailapoorit band, mrittika band, pooran kii reetiyaan, jalaashyon main jal risaav ke adhyayan ke liye vikiransheel samasthanikon kaa prayog, avsaad ke ghanatv ke liye gamma kirnon kaa prayog
 Mechanical engineering includes engineering, vibration, shipbuilding, heat transfer, refrigeration related to mechanics, thermodynamics, water vapor, diesel and tarnishing, mechanics, meteorology, instrumentation, hydropower, metallurgy, aeronautics, motorcars, etc
 vaidyut abhiyantriki main vidyudyantr, vidyut-shakti-utpaadan, sancharna tath vitaran, jalavidyut, radiosampark, vidyutmapan, vidyudadhishthapan, atyucchavriti kaary, nabhikeey abhiyantriki, electraniki hai

 krishi abhiyantriki main audyogic prabandh, khani abhiyantriki, ityadi, hai
 Computer engineering electraniki athwa electronics Metal disposal engineering khanan abhiyantriki Engineering cannot be divided into narrow finite branches
 ve parasparavalambee hai
 The uninterrupted inspection of both experimental and natural phenomena and the careful use of the fruits of this type of inspection on engineering problems in such a way that the minimum expenditure of time and money gives maximum service to the society is the major method of engineering
 shuddh vaigyanik abhiyantriki kii ulajhanon ko sulajhane kii reeti vaigyanik chaahe khoj paae hon yaa na paae hon, abhiyantaa ko to apana kaary puraa karnaa hi hoga
 In such a situation, the engineer resorts to experimental analysis to some extent and finds a solution that can work in a way that, while properly managing the defense, can make his daily problems solvable
 jais-jaise sambandhit vaigyanik ansh kaa uskaa gyaan achook hota jaataa he, vah raksha ke prabandh main kami karke vyay bhi gata saktaa he
 The intellectual and functional consideration of the problems has also enabled the engineer to enter into those fields which are believed to be concerned with scientist, doctor, economist, manager, humanistic science and art from the beginning
 vishwa kaa itihaas abhiyantriki ke romance kii kahani se bharaa padaa he
 In India and abroad, visionary and determined people have done important tasks by staking everything in accordance with their dreams
 prayek abhiyantric abhiyaan main tatsambandhi vishesh samasyaayen rahati hai or inako hal karne main choti-badi donon prakaar kii pratibhaaon ko avasar miltaa he
 Engineering is an applied science
 ejiniyari main karypranali kaa mahatv pehle se he kintu ab yah or bhi adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 As a result, 'systems engineering', 'knowledge engineering' etc
 have been born
 mote taur par kisi bhi ejeeniyar ko do baaten samajni hotin hai - Considering the 'requirements' and restrictions, the engineer prepares specifications, drawings, quality controls to manufacture the required goods or services
 praayah ejeeniyar ke paas ek se adhik hal hote hai
 He considers diverse options
 vah vikalpon ko takneekee, aarthik tathaa suraksha kii drushti se moolyankan karata he or jo sarvaadhik upyukt parinaam detaa he use chun liya jaataa he
 Engineer work is very challenging
 galat hal kaa parinaam bahut mahangaa yaa bahut khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why often an engineer tests and analyzes a solution before implementing it
 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem
 Do away
 computer ke aane se ejiniyari kii karypranali main moolbhoot parivartan aa gaya
 Earlier long-term calculations were done to design something, experiments were done, design reviews were done, but now computer simulations are being replaced by them
 'finite elemants methd' ke aagaman se yantriki, dravgatiki, vidyutchumbakatv, mausamavigyaan, ooshmaa-gatiki aadi ke kathin se kathin simulation kiye jane lage hai
 Computer software is being used for designing circuits, layouts of circuits, testing of circuits, etc
 sanseksh main kahen to computor kaa prayog dizin main, drafting, pareekshan main, nirmaan main or rakrakhaav main - sab jagah hone laga he
 In addition, the engineer gets help from the computer at every step - in design, production and in improving the equipment
 dizin main computer ke upyog se kaary shighrata se puraa ho jaataa he
 In many cases nowadays, modeling by computer can relieve the creation of expensive prototypes
 computor software main aajkal pehle se nirmit takneekee halon kaa database bhi uplabdh he
 Now instructions are given to numerically controlled machines, which has greatly simplified the process of production
 ise bhi dekhen - mahapariyojnaon kii suchi Most of the engineering works are huge

 Many religious organizations use the engineering directly for the good of mankind
 aisi kuch sansthaayen nimnlikhit hai- In the field of law, such defective work is termed as defamation or imputation which is not related to breach of contract nor criminal
 apakruti kaa prayog kanoon main kisi aise apkaar athwa kshati ke arth main hota he jisaki apni nishchit visheshtaayen hoti hai
 The main feature is that its retaliation is possible by compensation and there is no need to send imprisonment
 apakruti kii visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai- Dishonesty is an infringement of the right of a person or a violation of the duty of another person towards him; iskaa pratikaar vyavahaarwad dwaara ho saktaa he; In England, before 1895 AD, the refusal of defamation was under the common law
 apakruti ke anek rup hai
 The root word "tart" in public means that the violation of the straight and simple path
 apakruti ke pramukh rup ye hai: The use of the word "tart" in the English legal system began during the reigns of the Norman and Rangevin emperors
 san 1896 i
 ke purv praaia: paanch shatabdiyon tak apakruti kaa pratikaal samrat ke lekh par nirbhar rahaa
 The English law on defamation is found in most cases as a debatable method, although in the beginning of the last century, some rules were also made
 atev sarabhoot vidhi ke rup main apakruti kanoon kaa vikaas aadhunik kaal main hua
 Long before the adoption of the English law in India, in the distant past, evidences of the law of defamation are found
 manu, yajyavlky, naarad, vyas, brihaspati tathaa katyayan kii smritiyon main apakruti sambandhi hindu vidhipranali kaa aadhaar hamen miltaa he
 An important difference between the Hindu and English defamation-law systems is that retaliation by compensation in the Hindu system is possible only when economic loss has occurred, not in cases of aggression or defamation or adultery
 muslim vidhipranali main apakruti kanoon kaa kshetra or bhi adhik sankeern ho gaya
 He was punished for acts of violence, only in cases of property acquisition
 apakruti tathaa aparaadh ke siddhant evam prakriya donon main antar he
 Dishonesty is the loss or breach of duty which the person is concerned with and the person is entitled to compensation by the torts
 parantu aparaadh lokkartavya kaa ulanghan samajha jaataa he or iske liye samaaj athwa rajya apradhi ko dand detaa he
 There are many instances of damage that fall under both the categories of delinquency and crime; Such as invasion insult or theft
 kabhi-kabhi koi kshati keval aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhi ja sakati he; jaise saarvajanik baadha or iske thik vipareet katipay kshatiyaan keval apakruti kii shrenee main aati hai; jaise anadhikaar pravesh
 There is a difference in the process of delinquency and delinquency in that the prosecution of a case of defamation is presented in the court but criminal cases are prosecuted in the penal court
 apakruti main vaadi kaa adhikaar saadhaaran vidhi ke antargat prapya adhikaar he parantu sanvidabhang ke maamle main pakshon ke adhikaar evam kartavya sanvida ke upbandhon ke anusaar hi hote hai
 In the contract, the amount of compensation is also fixed and in the indemnity principle, only the provision of the contract is followed, rather than punishment

4 Dera Shadinagar is a village in Kayamganj, Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh
 sati daksh prajapati kii putree or bhagwaan shiv kii patni thi
 The story of their origin and end is available in different forms in different Puranas
 shaiva puraanon main bhagwaan shiv kii pradhanta ke kaaran shiv ko param tatva tathaa shakti ko unki anugamini bataaya gaya he
 Parallel to this, Shakti Puranas have described Shakti as the supreme power and Lord Shiva as his follower
 shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main apekshaakrit tatasth varnan he
 It talks about the birth of 16 girls from the womb of maternity, daughter of Daksha's self-styled manu
 devipurana main 14 kanyaon kaa ullekh hua he tathaa shivpurana main daksh kii saath kanyaon kaa ullekh hua he jinamein se 27 kaa vivaah chandramaa se hua tha
 There was also a sati among these girls
 shivpurana ke anusaar brahma ji ko bhagwaan shiv ke vivaah kii chintaa hui to unhone bhagwaan vishnu kii stuti kii or vishnu ji ne prasann hokar brahma ji ko bataaya ki yadi bhagwaan shiv kaa vivaah karwaanaa he to devi shiva kii aradhana kiijie
 He told that he should ask Daksha to do penance of Bhagwati Shiva and appease him and ask for the boon of being his daughter
 yadi devi shiva prasann ho jaaegi to saare kaam safal ho jaaenge
 According to his statement, Brahma ji asked Daksha to do austerities of Bhagwati Shiva and Prajapati Daksha did severe penance of Goddess Shiva
 unki tapasya se prasann hokar shiva ne unhen vardaan diya ki main aap kii putree ke rup main janm luungi
 i am the maid of Lord Shiva in all births; Therefore, i will please Lord Shiva by doing austerities and become his wife
 saath hi unhone daksh se yah bhi kaha ki jab aapkaa aadar mere prati kam ho jayega tab usee samay main apane sharir ko tyaag duungi, apane swaroop main leen ho jaaongi athwa doosraa sharir dhaaran kar loongi
 He gave this boon to Daksha for every canto or kalpa
 tadnusaar bhagwati shiva sati ke naam se daksh kii putree ke rup main janm leti he or ghor tapasya karke bhagwaan shiv ko prasann karti he tathaa bhagwaan shiv se unka vivaah hota he
 The story after this is very much in line with the narrative described in the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana
 prayag main prajapatiyon ke ek yajna main daksh ke padhaarney par sabhi devatagan khadey hokar unhen aadar dete hai parantu brahma ji ke saath shivaji bhi baithe hi rah jate hai
 Due to his cosmic wisdom, considering Lord Shiva as his son, that is, like a son, Daksha feels insulted for not standing up to him and not showing respect to him and that is why he used many gimmicks towards Lord Shiva and offered him a sacrificial part Cursed to be deprived
 isi ke baad daksh or bhagwaan shiv main manomalinya utpann ho gaya
 Thereafter, a huge yajna was organized by Daksha in his capital Kankhal in which he neither invited Lord Shiva nor his daughter Sati
 sati ne rohinee ko chandramaa ke saath vimaan se jate dekha or sakhi ke dwaara yah pataa chalane par ki ve log unheen ke pita daksh ke viraat yajna main bhaag lene ja rahe hai, sati kaa man bhi vahaan jane ko vyakul ho gaya
 Despite the persuasion of Lord Shiva, Sati remained distraught and Lord Shiva with his ganas ordered him to go there
 parantu vahaan jaakar bhagwaan shiv kaa yajna-bhaag na dekhakar sati ne ghor aapatti jataayi or daksh ke dwaara apane tathaa unke pati bhagwaan shiv ke prati bhi ghor apmanjanak baaten kehane ke kaaran sati ne yogagni se apane sharir ko bhasma kar daalaa
 On being created by the Shivs, Bhrigu Rishi sacrificed in Dakshinagni and the deities named Ribhu, who were born out of it, drove the Shivgas
 is samachar se atyant kupit bhagwaan shiv ne apni jataa se virbhadra ko utpann kiya or virbhadra ne gana sahit jaakar daksh yajna kaa vidhwans kar daalaa; shiv ke virdohi devataaon tathaa rishiyon ko yathayogy dand diya tathaa daksh ke sir ko kaat kar havan kunda main jala daalaa
 After this, Lord Shiva was pleased to be praised by Brahma ji along with the gods, and again he recovered the damages incurred in the yajna and due to burning of the head of Daksh, he also got the goat's head alive
 phir unke anugrah se yajna purna hua
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are all believed to have originated with the grace of Shakti due to the predominance of Shakti in Shaktism
 devipurana main varnan hua he ki purna prakruti jagdambika ne hi brahama, vishnu or mahesh teenon ko utpann kar unhen sristi kaaryon main niyukt kiya
 He was the one who ordered Brahma to be the creator, Vishnu to be the follower and Shiva as his destroyer
 aadesh-paalan ke purv in teenon ne un parama shakti purna prakruti ko hi apni patni ke rup main paane ke liye tap aarambh kar diya
 Due to Jagadambika failing in the test, Brahma and Vishnu attained full nature as a wife and being pleased with the penance of Lord Shiva, Jagdambika herself gave birth and assured to become his wife
 tadnusaar brahma ji ke dwaara prerit kiye jane par daksh ne usee purna prakruti jagdambika kii tapasya kii or unke tap se prasann hokar jagdambika ne unki putree hokar janm lene kaa vardaan diya tathaa yah bhi bataa diya ki jab daksh kaa punya ksheen ho jayega tab vah shakti jagat ko vimohit karke apane dham ko laut jaaegi
 According to the boon, Purna Prakriti took birth as Daksha's daughter in the name of Sati and when she was eligible to marry, Daksha contemplated her marriage
 daksh apni loukik buddhi se bhagwaan shiv ke prabhaav ko na samajhane ke kaaran unke vesh ko amaryadit maanate the or unhen kisi prakaar sati ke yogya var nahin maanate the
 Therefore, considering this, he organized a zero swayamvar meeting with Lord Shiva and requested Sati to choose the groom according to his choice
 bhagwaan shiv ko upasthit na dekh kar sati ne 'shivaay namah' kah kar varmala prithvi par daal di tathaa maheshwar shiv swayan upasthit hokar us varmala ko grahan kar sati ko apni patni banaakar kailash laut gayi
 Daksha was very sad
 apni ichha ke viruddh sati ke dwaara shiv ko pati chun liye jane se daksh kaa man un donon ke prati kshobh se bhar gaya
 That is why Daksha did not invite Shiva and Sati in the Virat Yajna organized in his capital later
 phir bhi sati ne apane pita ke yajna main jane kaa hath kiya or shiv ji ke dwaara baar-baar rokane par atyant kupit hokar unhen apana bhayanak rup dikhaaya
 This describes Shiva's escape after being horrified and Jagdambika took 10 forms to stop him
 phir shivaji ke poochne par unhone apane dashon roopon kaa parichay diya
 Then after Shiv ji's apology, Purna Prakriti smiled and was eager to go to the yagna of her father Daksha, then Shiv ji told her sorrow and ordered a chariot attached to the majority of lions and got Bhagwati sent to Bhagwati's house with respect
 shesh katha katipay antaron ke saath purvavarnit katha ke praayah anuroop hi he, parantu is katha main kupit sati chhayasati ko lila kaa aadesh dekar antardhan ho jaati he or us chhayasati ke bhasma ho jane par baat khatm nahin hoti balki shiv ke prasann hokar yajna purnataa kaa sanket de dene ke baad chhayasati kii laash surakshit tathaa dedeepyaman rup main daksh kii yajyashala main hi punah mil jaati he or phir devi shakti dwaara purv main hi bhavishyavaanee rup main bataa die jane ke baavjood loukik purush kii tarah shivaji vilaap karte hai tathaa sati kii laash sir par dhaaran kar veikshipt kii tarah bhatakate hai
 With this, Lord Vishnu cuts the corpse of Sati from the Sudarshan Chakra, in succession, to break the stricken deities and take care of the situation
 is prakaar sati ke vibhinn ang tathaa aabhushanon ke vibhinn sthanon par girane se ve sthaan shaktipeeth kii mahima se yukt ho gayi
 In this way 51 Shaktipeeths were constructed
 phir sati kii laash na rah jane par bhagavan shiv ne jab vyakulatapurvak devataaon se prashn kiya to devataaon ne unhen sari baat bataayi
 Relinquishing this, Lord Shiva cursed Lord Vishnu by incarnating him in the Suryavansha in the Treta Yuga to separate from his wife and then worshiped Bhagwati in 51 Shaktipeeths in the most prominent 'kamarupa' and by that perfect nature The next time, in the Himalayan house, Parvati received the boon of becoming his wife again by taking Purnavatar
 is prakaar yahi sati agle janm main parvati ke rup main himalay kii putree banakar punah bhagwaan shiv ko patni rup main praapt ho gayi
