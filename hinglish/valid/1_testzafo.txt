 Babu Brajratnadas and Dr
 Dasharatha Ojha consider its life as its 1772 year, the basis of which is Saraswati Bhavan, Udaipurwali No
 There is a handwritten copy of the year 1772, but in a handwriting in the Yagnik collection, it is found in the clerical 1751 year
 saath hi, ukt naatak ke saatven ank main ullekh he ki lachhiraam ne is naatak ko banaakar sanyasi kavindra saraswati ko dikhaaya
 Kavindra Saraswati composed 'yogavasthisar' in 1657 AD
 at: karunaabharan naatak kaa nirmaankaal 1657 i
 ke lagbhag mana ja saktaa he
 There are seven digits in Karunabharan but most of the handwriting found in it has only six digits
 saatvaan ank alag se miltaa he
 At the end of the sixth issue, the creator has reported that he has composed the said book in 300 verses, and by calculation, by the end of the sixth digit only 300 verses are found
 saatven ank main 35 chand hai
 Thus, the inclusion of verses in the seventh digit increases the number to 335
 iske atirikt chathe ank ke ant tak naatak du:khant he or naatak ke 'karunaabharan' namakaran se hi yahi prathit hota he ki kavi ne mulat: du:khant naatak likhaa tha
 It may be that the Karunabharan drama was severely criticized for its grief, or it was Kavindra Saraswati who instructed the play to be a melancholy rather than a grief, and according to his advice, the poet added the seventh digit of 35 verses
 Ho
 saatven ank ke ant main pushpika he - 'iti shri karunaa naatak devidas krit sampurna
 'at the end of this issue, in another handwriting, the name' Devdutt Guru 'is found in the Pushpika
 devidas or devdatt guru ek hi vyakti ke naam ho sakate hai
 He must have been the mentor of Lachhiram and on the advice of him, the seventh issue would have been composed to make the play a happy one
 karunaabharan naatak yadhyapi kavyanatak he or aalochak prabandhstyli par likhe brajabhasha kavy naatakon ko naatak nahin maanate, to bhi is naatak kaa manchan hua tha, is baat ke pramaan mil jate hai
 The poet himself states: lachhiraam naatak kiyo, deenon gunin padhaay
 Bahesh-rahesh-niratan nipun laa nut nis dhaya 
 Suhrid Mandali which is very large here
 jo uni nachyo so kahyo kavita main sukh saaj
 
 kavi ke uparyukt kathan se spasht ho jaataa he ki naatak kaa manchan hua tha or raatri ke samay hua tha
 There is more evidence
 is naatak ke pahari style ke 17 chitra milte hai 
 It seems that the said pictures were either made for pictorial dramas or for planning dramatic scenes
 saath hi ukt naatak kaa ek anya naam 'kurukshetralila' bhi miltaa he- 'ath kurakshetra lila lishate'
 This proves that it was practiced in the Raslila style related to Jannatya for staging

 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he

 surya bharti prakaashan, 2596, nai sadak, dilli-110006 Lathe machine or lathe is a machine tool used for making goods with symmetrical design of axis
 isamen dhaatu kaa pind ek aksh par ghurnan karata rahata he or kaatane, chhed karne evam anya kriyaayein karne vaale aujaar is par aavashyaktaanusaar lagaakar ise uchit rup diya jaataa he
 a lathe is a device on which round pieces are prepared
 haath ke kisi upkaran se kisi cheez ko icchit gol rup main nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 Therefore it is tied in a lathe, which keeps rotating this thing
 tab aujaar se is par kaam kiya jaataa he
 The machine with which all this work is done is called a lathe
 chitra main ek saral kharad dikhaaya gaya he
 On the left side of the lathe is its crescent, which serves to hold and rotate the limb that is ready
 shirodand main ek khokhla takala he jo do dharukon par ghumta he
 Between the two holders, a spindle is encased on the spindle, on which there are usually three posts, from these positions the speed of the edict can be increased and reduced
 isi prakaar kii ek ghirani us dhuree par bhi hoti he jisase motor dwaara is kharad ko chalaaya jaataa he
 The speed of the lathe is changed by shifting the top of the pulley from one post of the pulley to another
 takale ke baayein kinare par daantonvale chakra hote hai, jinako dantichakra kaha jaataa he
 The lathe is led by them
 kisi ang par chudiyaan kaatane ke liye netrubhrami kaa upyog aavashyak he
 And this is how the instrument column moves on its own
 jis prakaar kii chuudi kaatani hogi usee prakaar kaa upkaran prayog main laayaa jayega, parantu prati inch main chudiyon kii sankhya dantichakron dwaara vyavasthit kii jaaegi
 On the right side of the spindle is a lathe chuck
 isse us cheez ko pakadte hai jisapar kaam karnaa hota he
 There are often two types of chuck: shirodand ke pashchaat kaa upkaran stambh he
 This pillar is used to hold the devices and keep them in good condition
 isamen do chakra hote hai, jo haath se chalaae jate hai
 From one wheel the column is driven across the length of the lathe and from the other wheel the tool is pushed back and forth across the lathe width
 isliye bade chakra se upkaran kii kaat kii gati or chote chakra se kaat kii gaharaai ko sthir kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the job of tool column is to make the right kind of cut on an object
 kharad ke daahine kinare par puchhdand hota he, jiskaa kaam shirodand kii sahaayta karnaa he; jaise, yadi kisi lambii vastu par kaam karnaa he or usko keval chak main hi pakadaa jaay to bal padane par vastu jhuk jaaygi
 Therefore, by making a hole between the other edge of such object and depositing it from the center of the tail, then this object also rotates at this center
 iske kaaran iske jhukne kaa dar nahin hota
 The shape of a lathe is considered to be the name of the organs working on it
 yadi ham kahen ki kharad kaa aakaar 12 x 60 inch he, to iskaa matlab hua ki is kharad par sabase bada krityak 12 inch vyas kaa or 60 inch lambaai kaa bandha ja saktaa he
 This type of lathe is called a fruit lathe
 yadi shirodand ke chak ke neeche kharad main adhik sthaan chhod diya jaae, jiske kaaran kharad ke aakaar se bade kaam ko us par bandha ja sake, to usko antaraal kharad kaha jaayga
 There are three ways to tie an object on a lathe: chak or puchhdand ke kendron par vastu ko baandhna vastu ke donon kinaaron ke vyas ke bich chhed banaakar, donon dandon ke kendron par chadhaakar kas diya jaataa he
 This tension is caused by rotating the wheel of the tail
 kaam kii lambaai ke anusaar puchhdand ko aage peeche kiya ja saktaa he
 Tying the work to the chuck and mukhapatt par kaam ko bandhna
 This is the way the work is done
 shirodand kaa takala khokhla hone ke kaaran lambii chhadon ko pakadaney main suvidha hoti he
 The function of the tails is not only to handle the work, but also to make holes and enlarge the inner diameter
 kharad par kai prakaar ke kaam kiye jate hai
 Rounding an object and making it of a particular diameter, cutting the bangle, casting on an object, enlarging small holes, increasing the inner diameter and so on
 vastu par pehle gahari kaat lekar usko naap se kuch hi zyada rakh liya jaataa he
 After this, the work is brought to its right size by taking short cuts
 har prakaar kii kaat ke liye alag-alag upkaran hote hai
 The type of work that has to be done, the same type of equipment has to be purchased
 chudiyaan kaatane ke liye upkaran usee rup kaa banaaya jaataa he jis rup kii chuudi hoti he
 There are many types of lathes which are difficult to tell here, but the rule of working of each lathe is the same as stated above
 kharad par kaam karne se pehle kuch baton ko dhyaan main rakhana bahut aavashyak he
 Before running the lathe, it is beneficial and necessary to clean it and give oil to all its parts
 tel dene se kharad kaa har bhaag acha kaam karata he
 The object being worked on is heated by cutting
 yadi isko thandha nahin kiya gaya to upkaran bhi garam ho jaayga or uski dhar nasht ho jaaegi
 This will make it difficult to cut the metal and the metal will not be able to cut properly
 isliye dhaatu kaatane ke saath-saath us par tel bhi diya jaataa he
 One, this oil helps in tool work and the other keeps the metal frosty
 yah tel khaas taur se isi kaam ke liye banaaya jaataa he
 For this purpose, soap is also dissolved in water and brought in less
 yah bhi dekha gaya he ki kharad par kaam karne vaale kaa koi kapadaa kharad ke kisi chalanevaale bhaag main fas gaya or iske kaaran durghatana ho gai
 Therefore, working on a lathe wearing loose clothes is not good
 kharad ke chalanevaale sab angon par bhi koi roak lagaana aavashyak hota he
 Keeping all the metal cutting tools sharp does a good job
 kam gahare or choti kaat lene se kaam kaa roopak acha hota he
 In some factories, an axle was mounted upwards to run the lathe, which was driven by an engine
 is dhuree par kai ghiraniyaan lagaai jaati thim or har ghirani se ek kharad chalati thi
 There were many difficulties with the use of this system, one is that even if one or two lathes were to be run, an engine of the same power would have to be used to run all the latches simultaneously
 isse kharaadon ko chalaane main adhik laagat aati thi
 Secondly, if there was any fault in the engine, then the work of all the latches would stop
 tisare, isse durghatnaayen bhi adhik hoti thim
 So nowadays this system is not used
 ab har kharad ke saath uski apni motor aati he, jisko jab bhi aavashyak hota he chalaa liya jaataa he
 Thus the power of each lathe remains different with it

 The Administrative Reforms Commission is a committee appointed by the Government of India to give suggestions to make the public administration of India more effective
 pratham prashasnic sudhaar ayog 5 janvari 1966 ko niyukt kiya gaya tha
 The second Administrative Reform Commission was created on 31 August 2005
 iske adhyaksh virappa moili the
 Today's state is an administrative state
 aaj prashasan maanav jivan ke harek pahalu se sambandh rakhata he
 The citizen sees the administration as a moral agent to fulfill his needs and help him reach his aspirations and goals
 kintu logon kii aavashyaktaaen to nirantar badalati rahati he or prashasan achal bana hua nahin rah saktaa he
 It has to be changed according to the environment
 prashasan main yaa to swatah parivartan ho saktaa he yaa phir kritrim rup se parivartan laayaa ja saktaa he
 Artificial changes are often called 'administrative reforms'
 hairald i
 caden- prashasnic sudhaar pratirodh ke viruddh prashasnic parivartan kaa kritrim abhipreran he
 Arnie F
 lemans- Administrative reform is an inspired change in the government machinery in an effort to bridge the gap between precision and desirability
 uparyukt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par ham prashasnic sudhaar ke nimnlikhit antar-sambhddha gunon kii pahchaan kar sakate hai
 According to Caden, administrative reform is necessary for the following reasons: isi roodhiwaadee pravriti ke kaaran sanghathan parivesh main hue parivartanon kii ore se ankhen pher lete hai
 Organizations ignore clear warning signs until the problem goes beyond diagnosis
 isi roodhiwaadee pravriti ke kaaran prashasnic sudhaar aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The appropriate three principles are rarely wrong and administrative reforms have become a place in the study and practice of public administration
 is aavashyaktaa ko mahasoos kiye jane ke kaaran prashasnic sudhaaron kaa nirantar sansthanikaran ho rahaa he
 Every public administration is being trained and encouraged to be its own reformer
 prayek sarkari sanghathan main adyunathan praudyogiki kaa gyaan rakhane, abhinav parivartan ko badhaava dene evam vyavsaayik rup se anumodith siforeeshon ko apnaane kii apeksha kii jaati he
 In short, the concept of administrative reforms has arrived
 apane vistaar or gaharaai ke vichaar se prashasnic sudhaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 One way to classify reforms is to pay attention to its content
 saamanytah nimnlikhit prakaar ke prashasnic sudhaaron kii pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 Structural Reforms: The most important component of every administrative organization is the structure, ie a device that provides for division of work, delegation and decentralization in the organization
 sanrachanaatmak sudhaaron kaa aashay aise sudhaar prastaavon se he jo sanrachana kii prabhaavaneeyata or kushalta badhaane ke uddeshy se isamen parivartan laana chaahate hai
 Procedural Reforms: Processes become institutionalized with the passage of time in any organization, such as financial rules, personnel policies, neutralization practices, etc
 sanghathan puraani prakriyaaon se chipke rahanaa chaahate hai
 Procedural reforms seek to change processes in an effort to remove red tape
 udhaahranh bharat main staff nirikshan ikai sudhaar laane par dhyaan kendrit karti he
 Behavioral reforms: All large organizations want to develop an official tantric structure
 kisi bhi adhikari tantra main iskaa avaiyaktik charitra or vyaktiyon ko paryaapt mahatva kaa abhaav rahata hi he
 Due to dehumanization of individuals, lack of motivation arises among the members of the bureaucracy which directly affects the quality of services rendered by the people
 vyavahaarparak sudhaar vyakti kii mahatta or garima ko punah sthapit karnaa chaahate hai taaki ekta kaa vaataavaran bane evam samoohgat sadbhaav panape
 Thus, these reforms have a direct impact on employee motivation levels
 upar varnit bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke sudhaaron par alag-alag yaa sanyukt rup se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not necessary to say that if one is to take full advantage of the reforms, then all the reforms should be considered simultaneously
