 According to Prof
 Gaud C

 According to the orthopedics of children at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi, the science of adapting ergonomics i

 Islam is a monotheistic religion which, according to its followers, is based on the teachings of the Qur'an, the last divine book of Allah, delivered by Muhammad, the last Rasul and prophet of Allah
 quran arabi bhashaa main rachi gai or isi bhashaa main vishwa kii kul jansankhya ke 25% hisse, yani lagbhag 1
6 se 1
8 arab logon, dwaara padhi jaati he; inamen se lagbhag 20 se 30 karod logon kii yah maatrubhaasha he
 The Sharia, a book written purportedly from the mouth of Hazrat Mohammad Saheb and providing instructions to follow the book, are the only two resources that rightly identify the source of Islam's information
 islamic dharm ke pramukh mat yah hai: Muslims believe in a single God whom they call Allah
 akeshwarwad ko arabi main tauhid kehete hai, jo shabd vaahid se aata he jiskaa arth he ek
 In Islam, God is considered beyond human comprehension
 musalamaanon se ishvar kii kalpana karne ke bajaay uski prarthana or jai-jayakaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 According to Muslims, God is unique - there is no one like him
 islam main ishwar kii ek vilakshan avadharana par bal diya gaya he or yah bhi mana jaataa ki uskaa sampoorn vivaran karnaa manushya se pare he
 Say: na use kisi ne janaa or na hi wo kisi kaa janak he
 And there is no one like that
 ” According to Islam, from time to time, God made a person his messenger for the guidance of man on earth
 lagbhag sansaar me 124,000 nabi ek khuda ko poojane kaa sandesh dene ke liye bheje gayi the
 These messengers were also among humans and called people towards God
 ishwar in duuton se vibhinn roopon se sampark rakhata tha
 These are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishwar ne swayan, shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muhammad Sahab was also a part of this link
 unako jo dharmik pustak pradaan kii gayi uskaa naam quran he
 The Qur'an describes 25 other prophets of Allah
 swayan quran ke anusaar ishwar ne in nabiyon ke alaava dharti par or bhi kai nabi bheje hai jinka varnan quran main nahin he
 All Muslims accept the legitimacy of all prophets sent by God and Muslims consider Muhammad the last prophet of God
 ahmadiyya samudaay mohammad sahab ko antim nabi nahin maanata tathaapi swayan ko islam kaa anuyaayi kahata he or sanyukt raashtra dwaara sweekaara bhi jaataa he haalanki kai islamic rashtron main use muslim maananaa pratibandhit he
 According to the Supreme Court of India, he is considered a Muslim in India
 musalamaanon ke liye allaah dwaara rasulon ko pradaan kii gayi sabhi dharmik pustaken vaid hai
 According to Muslims, the Quran is the last religious book provided by God to man
 quran main chaar or pustakon kii charchaa he: Muslims believe that Christians and Jews have changed the messages in their books
 ve in chaaron ke alaava anya dharmik pustakon kaa ishwariya hone kii sambhaavna se manaa nahin karte hai
 Muslims believe in the existence of angels
 unke anusaar devdoot swayan koi vivek nahin rakhte or ishwar kii ajna kaa yatharoop paalan hi karte hai
 They are only abstract and flawless figures made of light, which are neither male nor female, but different from human beings in every sense
 haalanki devdoot agananeey hai, par kuch devdoot quran main prabhaav rakhte hai: Like other religions of Central Asia, in Islam also, the end of the universe is considered by the doomsday
 iske anusaar ishwar ek din sansar ko samaapt karegaa
 Only God is aware of when this day will come
 islam ke anusaar sabhi mrit logon ko us din punerjeevit kiya jayega or allaah ke aadeshaanusaar apana jivan vyateet karne waalon ko swarg bheja jayega or uskaa aadesh na manaane waalon ko nark main jalaayaa jayega
 Muslims believe in luck
 bhagya kaa arth inke liye yah he ki ishwar beete hue samay, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bare main sab jaanata he
 No event can happen without his permission
 manushya ko apni ichha se jeene kii swatantrata to he par isaki anumati bhi ishwar hi ke dwaara use di gayi he
 According to Islam, man is himself responsible for his misdeeds because God allows man to take them for himself or not
 uske kukarmon kaa bhi purv gyaan ishwar ko hota he
 There are two major classes of Islam, the Shia and the Sunni
 donon ke apane apane islamic niyam hai lekin aadharbhoot siddhanth milte-julate hai
 Many Sunnis do not consider Shias completely Muslims
 sunni islam main har musalmaan ke 5 aavashyak kartavya hote hai jinhen islam ke 5 stambh bhi kaha jaataa he
 Slightly different doctrines are called stanzas in Shia Islam
 sunni islam ke 5 stambh hai- Arabic: لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله Transliteration: La ilaha ilallah Muhammad Rasool Allah Hindi: There is no other God but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
 is ghoshnaa se har musalmaan ishwar kii akeshwarvadita or mohammad ke rasul hone ke apane vishwaas kii gavaahi detaa he
 This is the most prominent principle of Islam
 har musalmaan ke liye anivaary he ki vah ise sweekaare Islam has its own influence on every aspect of life for Muslims
 islamic siddhanth musalamaanon ke gharelu jivan, unke rajnatik yaa aarthik jivan, musalmaan rajyon kii videsh niti ityadi par prabhaav daalate hai
 The Shariah refers to a set of policies that is based on Islamic legal traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 sharia kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen panth kehete hai
 The major texts in Sunni Islam are- adhiktar musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron panth aadharbhoot rup se sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he
 Muhammad the Prophet attained the ultimate knowledge in the hills of Mecca around 610
 jab unhone upadesh dena aarambh kiya tab makka ke samrudh logon ne ise apni saamaajik or dharmik vyavastha par khatra samajha or unka virodh kiya
 Finally in 622 he had to travel from Mecca to Medina with his followers
 is yatra ko hijra kaha jaataa he or yaheen se islamic calendar kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The lives of the people of Madina were troubled by mutual fighting and the messages of Hazrat Muhammad Sahab made them very popular there
 630 main hazrat mohammad sahab ne apane anuyaayiyon ke saath ek sandhi kaa ulanghan hone ke kaaran makka par chadhaai kar di
 The Meccans surrendered and converted to Islam
 makka main sthit kaaba ko islam kaa pavitra sthal ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Prophet Muhammad saheb died in 632
 par unki mrityu tak islam ke prabhaav se arab ke saare kabeeley ek raajnneetik or saamaajik sabhyataa kaa hissaa ban gayi the
 After this, the Khilafat phase began in Islam
 mohammad ke sasur abu bakr siddiq musalamaanon ke pehle khalipha 632 main banaaye gayi
 Many prominent Muslims accepted the mill to be their caliph
 sunni musalamaanon ke anusaar abu bakr siddiq kii khilaafat ke sambandh main koi vivaad nahin hua apitu sabhi ne unhe khalifaa swikaar kar liya tha, sunni manytaaon ke anusaar hazrat mohammad sahab ne swayan apane swargvaas se purv hi abu bakr siddiq ko apane sthaan par imamat karne kaa kaary bhaar dekar abu bakr siddiq ke khalifaa hone kaa kaa sanket de diya tha san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko hazrat ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 Keep in mind that Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan, that is, Bani Hashim Ali, wanted to be Khalifa
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 parantu shiya muslim ke anusaar mohammad ke chachaa jaad bhai, ali, jin kaa musalmaan bahut aadar karte the ne abu bakr ko khalipha maanane se inkaar kar diya
 But this controversy was averted in order to prevent the destruction of Islam, in fact, because of the wisdom of Hazrat Ali, the fighting of Muslim forces from the Eastern Roman Empire and the Iranian Empire took place during Abu Bakr's tenure
 yah yuddh mohammad ke jamaane se chali aa rahi dushmani kaa hissaa the
 Umar bin Khatab was made caliph in 634 after Abu Bakr
 unke kaarykaal main islamic samrajya bahut tezi se failaa or sampurna irani samrajya or do tihaai purvi roman samrajya par musalamaanon ne kabaja kar liya
 The entire empire was divided into various territories and a governor was appointed for each region which was under the Caliphate
 umr bin khattab ke baad usmaan bin afphan 644 main khalipha bane
 These were also among the prominent companions of Muhammad
 usmaan bin afphan par unke virodhiyon ne ye aarope lagane shuru kiye ki wo pakshpaat se niyuktiyaan karte hai or ki ali hi khalipha hone ke sahi hakdaar hai
 Then the spirit of rebellion arose in Egypt and from there an armed group of 1000 people came to Madina, the capital of Islamic Empire
 us samay tak sabhi khalipha aam logon kii tarah hi rahete the
 Therefore, this group succeeded in killing Usman in 656
 kuch pramukh musalamaanon ne ab ali ko khalipha sweenkar kar liya lekin kuch pramukh musalamaanon kaa dal ali ke khilaaf bhi ho gaya
 These Muslims believed that it was not right for Ali to become the Khalifa until the killers of Usman were punished
 yah islam kaa pehla grihayuddh tha
 Initially, a part of this group was led by Ayesha, Muhammad's wife
 ali or ashya kii senaaon ke bich main jang hooi jise jang-e-jamal kehete hai
 Ali's army conquered in this battle
 ab syria ke rajyapal muavia ne vidroh kaa bigul bajaayaa
 Mu'awiya was also a relative of Usman, there was no result of war between Mu'awiya's army and Ali's army
 ali ne samrajya main faili ashaanti par kaabo paane ke liye rajdhani madina se kufa main pehle hi badal di thi
 Mu'awiya's armies now spread throughout the Islamic Empire, and soon Mu'awiya was captured by the entire empire except the territory of Kufa
 tabhi ek kattarpanthi ne 661 main ali kii hatya kar di
 After Ali, however, Mu'awiya became the Khalifa, but there remained a section of Muslims who believed that the Khalifa of the Muslims could belong to the family of Muhammad
 unka maananaa tha ki yah khalipha swayan bhagwaan ke dwaara aadhyatmik maargdarshan paata he
 According to him Ali was the first Imam
 yah varg shiya varg ke naam se prasiddh hua
 The rest of the Muslims, who do not believe that only the family of Muhammad can be Khalifa, are called Sunni
 sunni pehle chaaron khalifaaon ko rashidoon khalipha kehete hai jiskaa arth he sahi maarg pe chalane vaale khalipha
 Khilafat became hereditary after Mu'awiya became the Caliph
 isse umayyad kilaafat kaa aarambh hua
 According to Shia history cars, Yazid, son of Mu'awiya, started working against the policies of Islam as soon as he got the Khilafat, religious Muslims became uncomfortable by his act, now Yazid needed to recognize his wrong policies from such a person Grant that all Muslims trust, for this work, Yazid gave the blessings of Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Ali Alaihis Salaam and Hazrat Muhammad's only Hazrat Hussain, son of the daughter of Fatimah, wanted to sanction his Khilafat but Hazrat Hussain refused to give his approval because of his actions against the policies of Islam
 On the refusal of Hazrat Hussain, the soldiers of Yazid, Hazrat Hussain and his 72 Stopped water on the companions and took their housemates hostage by killing them with great disrespect, sunni mat ke bade vidhwano imam ahamed bin hambl, imam gajali vagairah ne yajid ko qatle hossain karne kaa zimmedaar nahin mana he
 Hussein attained martyrdom in this battle
 shiya log 10 muharram ke din isi kaa shok manaate hai
 The Ummayd dynasty remained in power for 70 years and during this period they occupied North Africa, South Europe, Sindh and many parts of Central Asia
 ummyad vansh ke baad abbasi vansh 750 main satta main aayaa
 Shia and Ajmi Muslims greatly assisted the Abbasids in rebelling against the Ummayd dynasty
 ummyad vansh kii ek shakha dakshin spain or kuch or kshetron par simat kar rah gayi
 The notion of only an Islamic empire now began to wane
 abbasiyon ke raaj main islam kaa swarna yug shuru hua
 The Abbasid Khalifa gave great importance to knowledge
 muslim duniya bahut tezi se vishav main gyaan kendra banane lagi
 Many scholars studied books related to literature, philosophy, science, mathematics etc
 of ancient Yunnan, India, China and Persian civilizations and translated them into Arabic
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki is ke kaaran bahut bada gyaanakosh itihaas ke pannon main khone se rah gaya
 Muslim scholars did not just translate
 unhone in sabhi vishyon main apni chhap bhi chodi
 Many new discoveries related to anatomy and diseases in medical science were made in India, such as the difference between measles and smallpox was understood
 ibane seenaa ne chikitsa vigyaan se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin jo ki aage ja kar aadhunik chikitsa vigyaan kaa aadhaar baniin
 Therefore, Ibne Sina is also called the father of modern medicine

 In Islamic Philosophy, the philosophy of ancient Greek civilization was developed with Islamic color
 ibane seenaa ne navaplatowad, arastuvaad or islamic dharamshastra ko jod kar siddhanton kii ek nai pranali kii rachana kii
 This created a new wave in philosophy known as Ibnisinism
 isi tarah iban rashud ne arestu ke siddhanton ko islamic siddhanton se jod kar ibnarashuwad ko janm diya
 The art of studying Islamic theology was developed with the help of dualism

 Finding the meaning of Muhammad Sahab's quotes, activities, etc
 and making laws from them became a subject in itself
 sunni islam main isse vidwaanon ke bich matbhed hua or sunni islam kanoonee maamalon main 4 hisson main bat gaya
 Politically, the Abbasid empire gradually weakened
 africa main kai muslim pradeshon ne 850 tak apane aap ko lagbhag swatantra kar liya
 The same situation happened in Iran

 In Asia the Mongols conquered many empires and left Buddhism and converted to Islam
 muslim samrajyon or isaaiyon ke bich main bhi ab takaraav badhane laga
 Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty conquered Jerusalem in 1187, who had come to the Christians in the first Salebi war
 13veen or 14veen sadi se osmani samrajya kaa asar badhane laga
 He subjugated many territories in southern and eastern Europe and North Africa
 khilaafat ab vaid rup se osmani vansh kii hone lagi
 The Shia Safavi dynasty in Iran and the Delhi Sultans in India and later the Mughal Empire ruled
 naveen sadi se hi islam main ab ek dharmik rahasyavaad kii bhaavana kaa vikaas hone laga tha jise sufi mat kehete hai
 Ghazali made some such arguments in the context of Sufism and the futility of philosophy that the emphasis of philosophy began to wane
 sufi kaavyatmakataa kii pranali kaa ab janm hua
 Rumi's masnavi is a prime example of this
 sufiyon ke kaaran kai musalmaan dharm kii ore waapas aakarshith hone lage
 Many people of other religions also accepted Islam
 bharat or indonesia main sufiyon kaa bahut prabhaav hua
 Indian Sufi saints like Moinuddin Chishti, Baba Farid, Nizamuddin were part of this link
 1924 main turki ke pehle pratham vishwayuddh main haar ke baad osmani samrajya samaapt ho gaya or khilaafat kaa ant ho gaya
 Islam has also spread to Europe and America due to the migration of Muslims from other countries
 arab daishon main tel ke utpaadan ke kaaran unki arthvyavastha bahut tezi se sudhar gayi
 Many Renaissance movements took place in Islam in the 19th and 20th centuries
 in main se salfi or devbandi mukhya hai
 An anti-western sentiment also developed which led some Muslims to be attracted to fundamentalism
 vishwa main aaj lagbhag 1
3 arab se 1
8 arab musalmaan hai
 Of these, about 85% are Sunni and about 15% are Shia
 sunni or shiya ke atirikt islam main kuch anya varg bhi hai parantu in kaa prabhaav bahut kam he
 Most Muslims live in countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia
 madhya purv, africa or europe main bhi musalamaanon ke bahut samudaay rahete hai
 There are about 48 countries in the world where Muslims are in majority
 vishwa main kai desh aise bhi hai jahaan kii musalmaan jansankhya ke bare main koi vishwasaneey jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 Worship of Muslims is called Masjid
 masjid islam main keval ishwar kii prarthana kaa hi centre nahin hota he balkee yahan par muslim samudaay ke log vichaaron kaa aadan pradaan or adhyayan bhi karte hai
 Many amazing examples of Islamic architecture are often seen in mosques
 vishwa kii sabase badi masjid makka kii masjid al haram he
 Kaaba, the holy site of Muslims, is in this mosque
 madina kii masjid al nabavi or jerushlaim kii masjid e aqasaa bhi islam main mahatvapurn hai
 The family and social life of Muslims is influenced by Islamic laws and Islamic practices

 Muslims often name their children from the Arabic language to show their Islamic identity
 isi kaaran vah dadhi bhi rakhte hai
 In Islam, there is a lot of emphasis on wearing shame while wearing clothes
 isaliye adhiktar striyaan burka pahenti hai or kuch striyaan nakaab bhi pahenti hai
 Islam's contact with other religions has been influenced by time and situation
 yah sampark mohammad ke samay se hi shuru ho gaya tha
 Apart from Islam at that time, there were 3 traditions in Arabia
 ek to arab kaa purana dharm tha jisaki vaidhata islam ne nahin sweekaar kii
 The reason for this was that religion did not believe in the unity of God, which was against the basic principles of Islam
 isai dharm or yahudee dharm ko islam ne vaid to sweenkar kar liya par islam ke anusaar in dharmon ke anuyaayiyon or pujaariyon ne inamen badlaav kar diye the
 After reaching Madinah from Mecca, Muhammad entered into a treaty with the Jews there, in which the religious and cultural autonomy of the Jews was accepted
 arab bahudevvaadiyon ke saath bhi ek sandhi hooi jise hudaiba kii sulah kehete hai
 Since Muhammad, often political reasons have been determining the behavior of other religions or Islam
 jab rashidoon khalifaaon ne arab se baahar kadam rakhaa to unka saamana parsi dharm se hua
 He was also accepted as legitimate
 in sabhi dharmon ke anuyaayiyon ko dhimmi kaha gaya
 Muslim Caliphs had to pay a fee called Jizya or Jiziya
 iske badale rajya unhen haani na pahunchane or suraksha dene kaa vaada karata tha
 Those who embraced Islam were often discouraged during the tenure of the Ummayads
 iskaa kaaran tha ki kai log keval rajnatik or aarthik laabhon ke liye hi islam kabool karne lage the
 By this, the jizya or jizya was beginning to decrease
 bharat main islam kaa aagaman to arab vyapaaree 7veen sadi main hi le aaye the
 But the early Muslim sultans arrived in India only in the 10th century
 ab tak aadhikarik rup se in sulatanon kaa islamic khalifaaon se koi sambandh nahin tha
 Therefore, all of them adopted their attitude towards Hindu religion according to their understanding
 shuru main kuch muslim sultaanon ne hindu dharm kii kam jaankaree hone ke kaaran use puraane arab ke bahudevvaad ke saath joda
 Sufi saints and the Bhakti movement played a very important role in removing this estrangement

 Nirmal Verma's stage stories of three stories 'dhoop Ki a piece', 'one and a half inch up' and 'weekend' were directed by Devendra Raj
 is sangrah main ye teenon kahaniyaan sankalit hai
 The spirit and style of the three stories is almost the same — each of the three characters has a long dialogue from beginning to end, along with the feeling that the dialogue begins with another character It happens, but its position here has no meaning, because when the dialogue is self-centered
 is prakaar ye kahaniyaan akelepan ke kuch kshanon main paatro ke swayan apane se saakshaatkaar kii kahaniyaan hai
 a piece of incense The story begins with a public park with several benches, a church in the background, and a few pieces of sunshine scattered throughout
 ek boodha he jo ek parambulator ke saamne baitha he or sanyog se usee bench par aakar baith jaataa he jahaan yah aurat rozaana aakar baithti he
 Thus the presence of a silent, old and busy character underlines this woman's loneliness even more

 Despite the story of a frame like 'a piece of incense', one and a half inches above, in its final form it became completely different from it

 According to our understanding so far, particles are excitations of quantum fields
 duusare kanon ke saath inaki antalakriya kii apni gatiki he
 Most of the interest in the field of particle physics is in fundamental areas
 moulik kshetron or unki gatishiltaao ke saar ko Standard Model siddhanth ke rup main prastut kiya gaya he
 That's why most studies in particle physics about the basic particles of standard models and their possible expansion
 aadhunik kan bhautikee khoj upaparmanvik kano par kendrit he jisame nabhik ko banane vaale can jaise electrons, protons ore neutrons radioactive ore scattering prakriya se banane vaale can jaise ki photons, neutrinos, ore muons ore saath hi exotic particles shaamil he
 If i say correctly, particle is a misnomer in pure physics because the dynamics of particle physics is perfected by quantum mechanics
 jaise ki kuch praayogic paristhi main yah tarag-kan dwaiti prakarti dikhte he, tathaa kuch jagah ye tarang jaisaa vyavhaar prastut karte he
 And in technical language, it is described by quantum state in Hilbert space, which has been described in quantum field theory
 kan bhotik vaigyaniko ke anusaar kan bhotiki ke praathmik kan electrons ore photons he, tathaa ye sabhi janate he ki ye can tarag jaisi prakati bhi prastut karte he
 All particles yet known and their conventional actions can be defined by standard models of quantum theory

 These elementary particles can combine hundreds of types of composite particles that have been discovered since the 1960s
 maanak model ab tak ke lagbhag sabhi prayogic pareekshan main safal rahaa he
 However, many philanthropists believe that this is just an incomplete version of nature, and the discovery of more substantial theories is still pending
 haal hi main neutrino ke dravyaman kii khoj ne maanak model main pratham praayogic vichlan prastut kiya he
 It is influenced by many theories of physics, some consider the principle of material reduction and some support the principle of completeness

 These ancient ideas were not based on empirical observations and experiments, but based on philosophical reasoning and essence
 19 ve sadi may dalton ne apane prayogon ke dwaara sase siddh kar diya kii sabhi padaarth ek hi tarah ke kanon se milakar bane he dalton or unke samakalinon kaa maananaa tha ki yah prakruti ke moulik kan the
 So they named these particles ATOMS which is inspired by a Greek word ATOMOS which means inseparable
 By the end of the 19th century, however, scientists had come to know that ATOMS is not the original particle of the phenomenon, but rather the organization of even smaller particles
 shruwati 20 ve sadi ke prayog nabhikeey vikhandan or nabhikeey sanlayan ke safalataa ke saath samaapt hue in prayogon ke kaaran ek parmaanu ko dusre parmaanu main badalane ke ek ese udyog ko janm diya jiske dwaara sise ko sone main badla ja sake halaaki yah sambhav nahin he
 These experiments also led to the development of nuclear weapons
 Between 1950 and 1960, many different particles were discovered in different experiments, also known as particle zoo, after the term particle zoo became a standard model in 1970
 In this standard model, almost all the particles were defined by some basic particles
 praathmik kanon ke vargeekaran kii vartmaan sthiti standard model he
 This model describes strong, weak and electromagnetic fundamental interactions using arbitration gauge bosons
 gej boson ki prajateey he gluons, W−, W+ z bosons and photons
