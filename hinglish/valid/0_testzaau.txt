 In some castes, germination is also done by germination

 In some animals, the shoots are partially attached to their parent
 aisi avasthaa main donon kii rudhirvahak nalikaay evam apwaahi naal sanyukt hote hai
 In this way, as a result of germination, many animals gather in the same pool of formation, and form a zoo

 Thus we see that some species grow as single adults, while in other species the periods of lagic and algal reproduction are found in an altered form
 ekal evam samuhik acidian kai prakaar ke vasasthaan ke anukool parivartit ho gaye hai
 Generally, the single ascidians are somewhat larger in size and require more space
 ye mukhyat: yaa to chattaanon, stabhon yaa jahaajon ke tal bhaag ke saath jude hote hai, yaa baaluu athwa keechad ke bheetar sthit hote hai
 Sprouts, or combined ascidians, cannot survive in the above types of environment
 ye adhikanshat: un samtal dharaatalon ke saath jude hote hai, jahaan svachh jal paryaapt maatra main, parantu veg se nahin, uplabdh hota he
 Animals that have more active germination activity tend to be smaller in size, but larger in number
 is prakaar ke jantunivah bahudhaa kshetrafal main vistrut hote hai, parantu inaki motaai adhik nahin hoti
 Combined ascidians make relatively small size eggs

 mimasaa darshan hinduon ke chah darshanon main se ek he
 Mimamsa is the name of the venerated meaning of Vedavakyas regarding the opposition
 ukt vichaar purv arya parampara se chalaa aayaa he
 But almost a quarter of five thousand years ago, the disciple of Samveda's Krishna Dvaipayana formulated it
 sutron main pur paksh or siddhanth ke rup main baadaraayan, baadari, aatreya, ashmarathy, aalekhan, etishaayan, kaamukayan, karshnajini ar labukayan maharishiyon kaa ullekh miltaa he, jiskaa vistrut vivechan sutron ke bhashya ar vaarthik main kiya gaya he, jinase sahasraadhikaran ho gaye hai
 This scripture is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedant's Uttermimamsa
 purmamimasaa main dharm kaa vichaar he ar uttarmimasaa main brahm kaa
 Therefore, the Dharmamimamsa of the East and the North, and the north-east is also called the Brahmanimansa
 jaimini muni dwaara rachit sutara hane se mimasaa kaa jaimineey dharmamimasaa kaha jaataa he
 The German scholar Maxmüller states that - "this philosophy cannot come in the category of philosophy, because it only discusses religion
 isamen jeev, ishwar, bandha, moksh or unke sadhano kaa kahin bhi vivechan nahin he
 " maxmooler mat ke pakshpaati kuch bhartiya vidvan bhi ise darshan kehane main sankoch karte hai, kyonki nyaay, vaisheshik, sankhya, yoga or vedant main jis prakaar tat tat prakarnon main pramaan or pramayon ke dwaara aatma-anatma, bandha-moksh aadi kaa mukhya rup se vivechan miltaa he, vaisaa mimasaa darshan ke sutara, bhashya or vaarthik aadi main drushtigochar nahin hota
 The above thinkers have expressed their views after studying the scripture with a gross intellect
 phir bhi spasht he ki mimasaa darshan hi sabhi darshanon kaa sahyogi kaaran he
 Jaimini has novelized these subjects in his sutra form "satsamprayoga Purushyasendriyanam Budhi Jan Tat Tatam" In the fourth sutra two words have come - Purusha and Wisdom
 purush shabd se "aatma" hi vivakshit he
 This meaning is written by Kumaril Bhatt in "bhattadipika"
 buddhi shabd se gyaan, pramaata, prameya or pramaan arth ko vyakt kiya gaya he
 The Vrittikar has given a detailed explanation of the direct, inferential words, meaning and unavoidable evidences in the three sutras to "tasya nimitta parishti:" in his lecture and a special discussion of subjectivism in the justified sutra
 isi kaa vishleshan shabar bhashya, shloke vaarthik, shastradipika, bhatt chintamani aadi granthon main kiya gaya he jisamen pramaan or pramayon kaa bhed, bandha, moksh or unke sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he
 In the philosophy of Mimamsa, the ideas of Varnashrama system, Adhanadi, Ashwamedhant etc
 have been discussed in the main life of religion of India
 praaia: vishwa main gyani or virakt purush sarvatra hote aae hai, kintu dharmacharan ke saakshaat falwetta or karmkand ke prakand vidvan bharatvarsh main hi hue hai
 Among them, the texts of Maharishi such as Katyayan, Ashwalayan, Apastamb, Bodhayan, Gautam etc
 are available even today
 
 The Indian ritual ritual theory receives redemption and support in this philosophy
 dow kunnan raja ne "brihati" ke dwitiya sanskaran kii bhoomika main iskaa samuchit rup se nirupan kiya he
 Although the name of religion is mentioned in Kanad Muni's vaheesic philosophy - it is not considered further
 kisi vidvan kaa kahana he - That is, just as a man goes into the Himalayas, desirous of going out to sea, in the same way, Kanad Muni, who was interested in lectures of religion, went on discussing the matter
 uttar mimasaa ke siddhant ke anusaar karmatyag ke pashchaat hi atmagyaan prapti kaa adhikaar he, kintu purv mimasaa darshan ke anusaar - According to this Vedamantra, Mumukshu people should also do karma
 vedavihit karm karne se karmbandhan swat: samaapt ho jaataa he - tasmanmumukshubhih kaary nityam naimittikan tathaa" aadi vachanon ke anusaar bhartiya aastik darshanon kaa mukhya praan mimasaa darshan he
 The Mimamsa philosophy is of sixteen chapters, with twelve chapters in order
 shastrasangati, adhyaysangati, padasngati or adhikarasangatiyon se susambaddha he
 What has been missed in these twelve chapters is represented in the remaining four chapters, which is famous as 'sankarsakand'
 usamen devtaa ke adhikaar kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, it is also called 'devata Kand' or can be called an appendix of two chapters
 bhaskar raay dikshit ne sankarshan cond kii vyakhya ke ant main likhaa he ki shodashadhai mimasaa ke rahete hue bhi pathnpathan madhya kaal main dwadashadhyay kaa hi hota tha
 Just as the scholarly class chants Tripada Gayatri even when Chatupada Gayatri is living, similarly in the present day, the study of Dwadashadhyayi Mimamsa is the only teaching
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar mimasaa ke bina vaakyarth kaa nirnay karnaa kathin he, kyonki amuk vaakya upasthit arth main pramaan he athwa anya arth main, is vichaar ke nirnay main jo nishkarsh aata he use mimasaa kaha gaya he, kintu yahan mimasaa shabd kaa arth darshan se he
 The idea of the meaning of non-contradictory Vedamantras for theology is called Mimamsa
 or vichaarpurvak praapt dharmagyaan mimasaa kaa fal he
 This is what Jamini has said in his philosophy of philosophy - that is, curiosity of religion

 Kumaril Bhatt described it as - aage vaakyarth nirnyopayogi sahasron nyaayon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Even six chapters have a brief theme
 is darshan main praptaprapt vivek nyaay se, athwa adagdh dahan nyaay se uddeshy vidhey bhav kaa vichaar kar veda-vaakyarth-nirnay se kartavya-akartavya kaa gyaan hota he
 Therefore, theology is the object of philosophy
 is darshan main dharmavichaar se upkram he
 Sanskrit literature is used in grammar for "grammar", grammatical justice, and "syntax" for epistemology
 is shaastra main hi dharmavichaar kii charchaa hai
 The main objective of the Indian public is religious worship
 anushthan fal ke bina nahin ho saktaa or falsaadhanta bhi saadhan saamagree ke bina nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, in short the means are also discussed
 anushthan ke purv dharm kaa lakshan, pramaan or saadhan fal jaananaa aavashyak he
 In this shastra, means, organs and balances are all three synonyms
 aise hi saadhy, sheshi or angi ye teenon paryaayavachi hai
 For example, if you want to perform the ritual of Darshan Purnamas for the attainment of heaven, then Darshan and Purnamas will be Angi and Prayas will be part of it
 darsh yag amavasya tithi ko or poornmaas yag poornima tithi ko hota he
 ) In this, the organ is the prime organ sponsor and the organ is usable
 is prakaar dharmaprapti ke sadhano ko jaanakar anushthan ke liye paurvapary kaa bhi gyaan apekshit he evam fal ke liye anushthey agni hotradi karmon ke prakaran main purvang or uttarang sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he, jinke liye "prakruti" shabd kaa prayog hota he
 But there is no recitation of the Anga in the Sannidhi of the solar day
 us sthal par aakanksha ke udai hone par darsh poornmaas main pratipaadit angon ko lenaa hota he jise atidesh kehete hai
 
 saamaanya rup se nirnay hone par bhi kis karm se kis karm main ang kaa aagaman hota he, iskaa vivechan visheshatidesh se kaha gaya he
 In spite of the excesses of the limbs, due to the difference in nature, the text is read in place of Prakrit
 udaahranarth "agney twa jushta nirvpaami"
 In this Shrutivakya, by placing the Suryapada of "suryohyeshti" in place of fire post, "surya Tvajushtam Nirvapami" recites this shruti
 aise vaakya ko "ooh" kehete hai
 Without the knowledge of these things, it is not possible to understand which parts should be used where and how, so that the ritual can be properly fruitful
 jis sthal par ang pathit na ho vahaan anya sthal se ang laana chahie, kintu jo vikruti yag ke upkaar kar sakate hon ve hi prakruti main liye ja sakate hai
 Those who cannot do favors in deformity, there is no recitation of other organs
 or unka anushthan bhi nahin hota
 Such words are called "obstructions"
 kis ang kaa baadh hota he or kiskaa nahin, iskaa nirnay "ooh" baadh ke adheen he
 And the desired fruitful karma is only one
 kintu kahin kahin anek bhi hote hai
 Some organs are ritualized before the head and some are also performed after the head
 udaahranarth samidheni prayajadi tathaa swisht krit anuyajadi
 It has been said about using those organs at the same time or multiple times - ek baar prayog karne kaa naam tantra he or anek baar ke karne kaa naam "aavriti" athwa "awaap" he
 Somewhere the organs are ritualized by mechanism and elsewhere by frequency
 isliye tantra or awaap kaa vichaar bhi aavashyak he
 For a particular fruit, do the ritual of the head organ and also perform its organs
 un angon ko bhi anya angon kii apeksha hone par jiske prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he use prasangi kehete hai
 It consists of the head mechanism, which is called context
 udaahranarth agnishtomic pashu purodashadi purvokt vishyon kaa purnagyata vyakti hi sangopang dharmanushthan kar saktaa he, jisaki vivechna "mimasaa darshan" main jaimini ne kii he
 The philosophy of this philosophy depicts the Dharmapramanas and depicts method, economism mantra, memory, etiquette, nomadism, conclusive sentences and strength
 dwitiyadhyaay main shabdaantar, abhyaas, sankhya, sangya, gun or prakarnaantar, ye chah karm bhed ke pramaan hai
 Shruti, gender, sentence, episode, place and Samakhya are the six evaluative evidences in Tritiyadhyaya
 chaturthadhyay main, shruti arth, paath, sthaan, mukhya or pravriti main chah bodhak pramaan hai There are seven types of excesses in Panchmadhyaya, directive, directive, nominal order, hypothetical order, dependency order and place-of-order
 ant ke do bhed saptavadhyay main varnit nahin hai
 These are denoted in the sense of authority and placements mandate
 navam adhyay main mantroh, samoh or sanskaroh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke "ooh" kaa nirupan he
 In Dasamadhyaya, there are three types of obstruction representations of distinction between earthlope, pratyamnaya and prohibition
 ekadshadhyay main tantra or aavaay kaa nirupan he
 Dwadasadhyaya has a representation of "context"
 is prakaar ek ek vishay kaa pratipaadan dwadashadhyaayaatmak mimasaa darshan main kiya gaya he jise "dwadashalakshani" bhi kaha gaya he
 Here the word symptom is a textbook isko do prakaar se vibhakt kiya gaya he jise upadesh or atidesh kehete hai
 Preaching is discussed in the first chapters
 dwitiya ke chah adhyyon main atidesh kaa vivechan he
 The above preaching is the overarching doctrine
 shaastra deepikacar parthasarathi mishra ke anusaar upadesh vichaar ke ananthar atidesh vichaar kaa aarambh hota he
 There are two chapters in present-day epistemology philosophy
 prayek adhyay main chaar paad hote hai, kintu tritiy, shashth or dasham adhyyon main aath aath paad hai, jise "shabra" adhyay bhi kehete hai
 In this way there are sixty feet in the whole book
 is darshan kii sutarasankhya main vivaad he
 In someone's opinion, two thousand six hundred fifty two, in another opinion two thousand seven hundred forty two sutras
 uparyukt varnan "aesekit" kii "karmmimasaa" naamak pustak prishth chaar main pratipaadit he
 "nyayamala", published from Anand Ashram Poona, has two thousand and forty five sutras
 isi prakaar kuch vyaktiyon ke mat se adhikaran sankhya nau sau saat praapt hoti he
 Some have nine hundred and fifteen sutras
 kintu "mimasasar sangrah" ke karta shankar bhatta ke anusaar "purvashatk" main paanch sau tees, uttardatk main chaar sau sattar sutara hai
 Thus the entire tribunal is divided into a thousand numbers
 uparyukt shloke ke anusaar adhikranon kii sankhya ek sahasr do sau pachaas he
 a tribunal is formed from many sutras, which consists of a principal sutra and other virtue sutras
 pradhan sutara purv paksh kaa pratipaadan karata he or anya sutara siddhant kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Somewhere the northeast side has been rendered by two sources
 aise hi kahin kahin par bina sutara ke hi purv paksh kaa utthapan karke sutara se siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Somewhere, in principle, the ex-party tax doctrine has been rendered by the undertaking
 ek paad main katipay adhikaran hote hai
 For example, there are eight tribunals in the first foot
 adhikaran main chha: padaarth hote hai - vishay, sanshay, purvapaksh, siddhant prayojan or sangati
 Consistency is of three types - scriptural consistency, chapter consistency, and foot consistency
 pratham sutara - pratham adhikaran kaa naam jigyaasa adhikaran he
 Thought is the subject of science
 vichaar shaastra aarambh karne yogya he yaa nahin, yah sanshay he
 Not initiable, this is the former side
 siddhant he ki vichaar shaastra aarambh karnaa chahie
 The origin of this subject is the study method in the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and the teaching method in the "prabhakar" view
 purvapaksh main adhyayan kaa adrishy prayojan he or siddhant paksh main arth-gyaan-rup drusht prayojan he
 Since the religion of religion is related to philosophy, its interpretation in this school of thought is relevant
 is adhikaran main adhyayan drushtaarth hota he, yahi siddh kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the basic method of thinking is the study method
 arthgyan kaa saadhan adhyayan vidhi se akshipt hota he
 That is why the beginning of the scripture is valid
 dwitiya sutara - dwitiya adhikaran main dharm kaa lakshan or pramaan he, jisaki kartavyata vidhivaakya se prathit hoti he
 He is a means of credit
 yahan shrey shabd se aihik or aamushmik donon arth abhipret hai
 Gumak is a legal proof in the religion
 jo nishedh dwaara pratipaadit hota he vah anarth kaa saadhan hota he, use hi adharm kehete hai
 Third Sutra - The third sentence is the proof of the law sentence
 yahan pratigya maatr kii gai he
 They are said to be of two types - "chodnaiv Symptom Yasya, Chodana Symptom Me Yasya" ie here the direct evidence is not proof from religion, but legalism is considered as proof in religion
 chaturth sutara - is sutara main pratham pratigya ke samarthan ke liye chaturth adhikaran he
 Characterization of the Lok Siddha direct evidence in this tribunal - "indriarthasanikarsjanyajanam gyanam pratham"
 arthath pratyaksh vartmaan sannikrusht ko hi grahan karata he or dharm utpadyman he, atev pratyaksh dharm main pramaan nahin ho saktaa, kyonki dharm bhavishyat kaalik he
 From these words, the philosopher has not even considered the evidential inference heat and economics
 pancham sutara - chaturth sutara main chaturth adhikaran kii pratham jigyaasa kaa samarthan karke pancham sutara ke pancham adhikaran main dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 Law is the only proof in this tribunal, this pledge has been supported
 isi prasang main pramaanon kaa pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 That is, the knowledgeable material generates authenticity, and from the same material also becomes authentic
 vaakya do prakaar ke hote hai - loukik or vaidic
 Because of the proverbial sentence being masculine, malevolent delusions are accompanied by faults, pramad, vipralambha, karanapatava etc
, therefore, the sentence is not proof
 mantra brahmanatmak shabdarashi veda apaurushey he
 Therefore, due to not being illusory due to imperfection in legalism, legalism is the only proof in religion
 is dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan karne ke liye pramaan kaa lakshan or shabdaarth kaa sambandh nity he
 Badarayana has also not accepted transcendence in Pramanya
 padaarth-pratipaadan main sanket dwaara shabd se padaarthon kaa, vaakyarth-pratipaadan main granth kaa or rachana dwaara purush kaa tridha sambandh hota he
 The entry of the man into the Veda has been denied by assuming the words and the meaning of the word-reader-relationship regularly
 arthath, veda purush ke dwaara pranit hai -aisa kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki hamanen vaakyon ko bina vyakti ke kabhi nahin suna, padhaa yaa janaa he
 Whereas, in the opinion of the Mimansakas, the relation of the word and the word Ghatpatadi-meaning is constant
 atah 'ye pad is arth ko bataata he'- is baat kaa hamen pataa na hone par bhi pad apane pratipaadya ko bataata hi he
 That is, even if there is no Shakti Graha, there is only the ability of rendering in the verse
 or vaakyarth sambandh ke dwaara purush sambandh ko pruthak karne ke liye vaakyadhikaran kii pravriti he
 In this tribunal, as the substance of the verse has power, the sentence has power in the sentence, such is not required for those who render, because the substance present in the verse is discovered by aspiration, merit and attachment
 Renders vaiyaakaran mat se vaakyarth vaakyashakti se bhaasith hota he
 According to this opinion, the relation of substances in word sense is related to the connection of dignity
 yah naiyayikon kaa mat he, jisase vaakya kii vaakyarth main pruthak shakti kii pratiti hoti he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne abhihitanvay kaa samarthan kiya he
 Prabhakar has supported Anavitabhidhan
 is tarah vaakyarth main purush sandendh dwitiya prakaar se nirast hua
 The third type is through scripture
 sandarbh vaakya kaa purush ke saath do prakaar se sambandh hota he, ek kartri-karm-bhav-sambandh dwaara or dwitiya prayukt-pravachan-bhav-sambandh dwaara hota he
 The discourse is common and the composition is extraordinary
 asaadhaaran visheshan hota he
 Therefore Veda is Pourusheya
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar vedon main purush, desh, nadi, vriksh aadi ke nirdesh hone ke kaaran vedon ko purushpranit athwa paurushey kehete hai, kintu mimasaa darshan ke anusaar pravachan bhi asaadhaaran mana gaya he
 For example, the legend about "katasamhita" or "kat brahmana" is the legend that "sorrow" was studied completely by Maharishi among many branch chapters
 dwitiya hetu he ki veda main purush, nadi aadi kaa naam aata he, isse bhi veda paurushey siddh hota he, kintu yah kalpana chatur-buddhi-vihit nahin; kyonki praaia: sarvapratham sansaarik vastuon ke naam veda se hi aae hai, usee drushti se lok -naam kii parampara chali he
 That is, the Vedas do not consider history to be impermanent, but it represents the continuity of history, its detailed interpretation is visible in the "shabarbhyas" of the epistle
 nity vishay or vaakya athwa vachan ko yathanupurvi brahmarshigan samadhi main darshan karte hai, atev veda main purvapurush kartrutvkalpana kaa lesh bhi samavesh nahin he
 "cosmic creations are masculine due to their male special curiosity, such as Mahabharata, Ramayana etc
 kumaril bhatta ke anusaar adhyayan parampara anadi he
 Therefore, Vedas are also extraordinary
 aise hi adhikaran siddhant nyaay se hi veda granth rachana ke dwaara purush sambandh nahin ho saktaa, atev vidhi vaakya hi dharm main pramaan he
 There is no fundamental formula in the philosophy of epistemology
 yadhyapi uttarmimasaa ke '"ek evatman: sharire bhavat" is sutara ke bhashya main shankaracharya ne likhaa he ki "purv-tantra" main atmpratipadak sutara nahin he, is vachan ko kahkar aatm swaroop kaa vivechan kiya he
 Quoting the Vrittikārā मतa doctrine authentically, it is written: "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvam and sharike vakshyam:"
 abhipraay yah hua ki purvamimasaa bhi uttarmimasaa kii tarah advay aatma ko maanakar hi nirmit hue hai, tathaapi purvamimasaa sharir ke atirikt kartta-bhokta aatmatatv ko maanakar hi prachlit hua he, kyonki karm-siddhant ke antargat "kritahani" or "akrutabhyagam" nihit he
 And from here there is the accomplishment of rebirth etc
 "chodana punararambh:" "satsamprayoge purushasyendryanam" in donon sutron se aatmbeej kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 And Vapan etc
 is the sacrament of pod
 purusharth main purush shabd se asthi yajna or krit yag se aatma ko fal prapti hoti he
 Shabar Swami, without specifying the sutra, considered the "yagyayudh Sentence" as an instrument, refuting the opinion of the non-believer, and proved the form of self through logic and srutis, which also proved the Vedas authenticity
 uttar-mimasaa main aatma ko ek hi mana gaya he; kintu "sankhya yoga", nyaay, vaisheshik or purvamimasaa main aatma ko anek mana gaya he, jiskaa karm ke dwaara sharir, indriya or man se sambandh hota he
 Therefore, body, sense and subject are called bandhas
 ukt tray aatma ko bandhan main daalate hai, jisase aatma sukhdu:khadi dwandv ko bhogata he
 While doing routine katattavya buddhi to routine moral deeds, the creature keeps on consuming the destiny deeds
 sharir indriya se atirikt jo brahm buddhi se aatma kii upasna karata he uskaa sharir indriya aadi se sambandh kaa koi kaaran nahin he, aisa vyakti vartmaan sharir ke naash ke pashchaat swa swaroop main sthit ho jaataa he
 According to Uttarmimamsa, body, senses and subject have been called bonds which are the cause of ignorance; His retirement is salvation
 udaahranarth - "nivritiratma Mohsya Known purvamimasaa bhi yahi sweekaar karata he ki sharir, indriya or vishyon kaa sambandh hi bandhan hai, tathaa uskaa vilay hi moksh he, jiskaa saadhan, gyaan or karm samucchy he
 There are two types of enlightenment
 shariratirikt atmagyaan ritu kaa ang hota he, jo ni:shreyaskaarak he
 Vedic and temporal sentences have been interpreted by a number of thousands of sentences for judicial usable judgments
 atev bhartiya darshanon main pratham sthaan karm pratipadak purvamimasaa darshan kaa hi he
 Uttarmimamsa considers creation from ignorance and destruction of creation from enlightenment
 nyaay, vaisheshik darshan ne dvanukadi kram se mahabhoot paryant mahasrishti or mahabhoot se parmaanu paryant vinaash ko mahapralay kaha he
 That is, the entire gesture functions are generated in a double order and are destroyed from macro to nuclear
 panch mahabhuton main prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu ke parmaanu nity hai
 The sky itself is continual, but according to the earlier epistemology, there are two types of creation and three types of holocaust, in which the word Mahasrishti and Khand Srishti are called two creation
 aise hi pralay, mahapralay or khand pralay shabd se teen pralay kahe gaye hai
 Among them, Khandi Srishti and Khanda Pralaya have been considered similar to nowadays
 udaahranarth kisi sthal vishesh kaa bukamp aadi se vinaash ho jaataa he or kahin par naveen vastu kii sristi ho jaati he
 In Mahasrishti, the creation of atoms in the Panchamabhuta by the atom from the atoms in the Mahasrishti, which is mentioned in the tenth mandala of the Rigveda - matsaypuranadi main bhi khand pralay ke antargat vidyaman padaarthon kii sthiti kaa vivaran praapt hota he, kintu purv mimasaa mahasrishti or mahapralay ko sweekaar nahin karata
 According to him, no evidence is available in the destruction of all substances
 jaisaa ki vaarthikkaar ne kaha he - Mimamsa philosophy considers block creation and block holocaust
 bhartiya chha: aastik darshanon main nyaay, vaisheshik or vedant kii ishwar sadhak yuktiyaan praaia: samaan hi hai
 For example "yato va Imani Bhoothani Jayante", "dyavabhumi Janayan Dev Ek:" "vishvasya Kattra Bhuvanasya Gopta" through these Srutis and "janmadasya Yatra": This Vedanta Sutra proves God
 isi prakaar nyaay shaastra ke "kshityankuradik kartrujanrya kaaryatvat ghatavat" anumaan se bhi ishwar kii siddhi kii gai he, kintu vedantiyon ne shrutiyon se ishwar ko siddh kar anumaan pramaan ko unka sahakaari kaaran mana he
 And Naiyayikas have supposedly proved God to be the cooperative cause of Shrutis
 sankhya darshan main do mat hai - seshwar or nirishwar
 The Sesvara Samkhists believe in God, but treat him with a special word
 nirishwar sankhyavaadee ishwar kaa nishedh karte hai, "kintu vigyaan bhikshu ne "ishwarasiddhe:" is sutara main "pramanabhavat" is pad kaa ullekh kar ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 Mimamsa philosophy does not prohibit the support of God in the same manner as the Naiyayikas, and like the Nirishvara Samyakists, but in the "sambandesh Parihar" treatise, Kumaril Bhatt has resolved the meaning of God in relation to the word
 abhipraay yah he ki sambandh kaa karta ishwar nahin he
 By accepting the above words, it is popular that Mimamsak is an atheist
 kumaril bhatta, nandishwar aadi mimasakon ne anumaansiddh ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he or vedasiddh ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 In fact, Mimamsa accepts Siddha Brahma or God from the Veda
 kyaaki mimasaa darshan veda kaa swatah pramaan maanata he
 Mimamsa is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedantaka Uttermimansa
 isse bhi veydant kaa mimasaa ke sidbhant ar mimasaa kaa veydant ke siddhanth maanya hai yah baat spasht haati he
 Vedhita Yagadi Karma Dravya and Deity are compatible with these two
 dravya dadhyadi he or devtaa shastrake samadhigamya he
 That is, the sentence which the deity says is considered the deity
 yahan devtaa ke vishay main teen paksh dashamadhyay ke chaturthpad main or shabar bhashya aadi granthon main bhi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The meaning deity is the specific deity and the word deity
 in teenon main antim paksh hi siddhant he, kyonki arth kaa samaran shabd ke dwaara hua karata he
 Therefore, because of the first appearance of the word, the word itself has been considered a deity
 udaahranarth "indraay swaha, takshakaay swaha" shabdon main indraay or takshakaay ye chaturthaant pad hi devtaa hai
 Even those who accept the meaning of the deity cannot ignore the word
 at: teenon pakshon main shabd mukhya hone ke kaaran mimasakon ne shabd ko hi devtaa sweekaar kiya he
 There is a rule here - the deity word which is in the method sentence should be pronounced in evacuation, renunciation and hymn, etc
, not its synonyms
 udaahranarth "aagneyamshtakapalam" main agni ke paryaayavachi "jatvedas" shabd kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 It is known from the above things that the "word goddess" is the principle of Mimamsa philosophy
 devtaa ke vigrahadi sadasad bhav kaa vichaar - agni aadi devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch is darshan main maane jate hai
 That is, Vigraha, Havish, Bhoga, Aishwarya, happiness and fruitfulness are these five Vigrasha
 ukt vachan ke aadhaar par hi vedantiyon ne devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch swaroop maane hai
 The idea is that just like humans etc
, the taxes, steps etc
 are also of the gods, they accept Havish, eat and eat and give happiness to the Yajaman
 at: devtaa vigrahadiman hai
 The above thought is the same Yasak Maharishi has proved masculinity with the sentence "athakaar Chintanam" of "nirukta"
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar "shabdamayi devtaa" kaa samarthan kiya gaya he, kintu shabar swami ne apane shashth devataadhikaran bhashya main devtaa vigrah kaa khandan kiya he
 Generally, all the scholars like Parthasarathi, Khandadeva etc
 have followed this path, but in his commentary, Kumaril Bhatt has considered the deity as a part of it and not the deity as the head, and has accepted karma primarily and said that karma is the fruit
 gives
 swami ke rahete hue das se koi fal kii yachana nahin karata
 Karmana Phaljakantavam and Shabdmayi Devta, the above two principles have been supported by other minders by considering the deity Vigrahadi
 bhashyakaar shabar kaa devtaa vigrah kaa niraakaran prodhiwaad se jaananaa chahie
 Therefore, Purvimamsa accepts the "word goddess"
 uskaa gyaan, taddhit, chaturthi vibhakti or mantravarna in teenon se hota he
 The only difference between them is that with the frequency of the corresponding power, the deity realizes
 chaturthi vibhakti lakshanya or mantravarna adhishthan kaa bodhan karata he
 Mimamsadarsan has considered the part of the deeds of the deity in the above manner in terms of his ritualism
 vastutah devatashastra ta nirukt he
 Nirukta is Vedang and epistemology is Vedapang
 atah vaidic devataatatvavichaar ke prasang main nirukt ke vivechan kaa swatantra ar mukhya devataatatvavichaar maananaa avashyak haata he
 The realization through sentences is called sentence comprehension or word comprehension
 vaakya bhi aakhyaant hi hota he - Subantachaya: Sentence, Tingantachayavakyam, Suptingantachayo Sentam
 usamen ye teen paksh hai, jinamein karkanvit kriya honi chahie
 According to Amarkosh - "tidd
subant chayo sentence verb va karkhavitaita"
 arthath subant or tingant vaakyon kaa karkanvit kriya paryavsaan hota he
 The three views of Kumaril Bhatt, Prabhakar and Murari are famous in the East India, but in the last, a famous text with the name "tripad Niti Nayan" has also been known
 mimasakon main abhihitanvayavaad ar anvitabhidhanwaad naam se do prasthaan prasiddh hai
 Among them, first is the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and second Prabhakar
 shaabdh bodh main bhaavana ko mukhya rup se bhatta ne sweekaar kiya he
 Prabhakar has accepted the task as the main one
 abhihitanvay shabd kaa yah arth he ki padon se pratipaadit padaarth gyaan aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti samanvit hokar lakshana ke dwaara shaabdabodh karaate hai In the Nyayamat, there is power in the substance of the posts and the verses signify knowledge
 padon se padaarth kii upasthiti hoti he
 Similarly, it is said in Mimamsa, for example Jyotishtomen Swarga Kamo Yajet "
 yahan "yajet" main do ansh hai -"yaj" dhaatu or "t" pratyay
 The suffix represents the emotional sense of exposition
 us bhaavana kii teen aakankshaayen hoti hai - saadhyaakanksha sadhanakanksha or "itikartavyatakanksha"
 On attaining realization, there is a true discovery of heaven
 sadhanakanksha hone par dhatworth kaa kaarantven anvay hota he
 
 iti kartavyatakanksha hone par itikartavyatatven anvay hota he
 The sentence states that vishisht arth kaa bodh karne ke liye vaakya lok main prayukt hota he
 Padraavana leads to separate knowledge of substances
 yah vaacharth he, kintu jo padaarthagyan hota he vah shrota ko abhipret nahin or jiske liye vaakya prayukt hua usase shrota kaa kaary nahin hota, aise sthal main vaakya taatpary kii anutpatti hoti he
 Consequently, symptoms have been considered for prevention of deficiency
 sabhi darshanikon ne taatparyanupapatti ko lakshana kaa beej sweekaar kiya he
 Two types of meanings are considered, first meaning and second meaning
 pratham avaantar taatpary padaarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he or mahataatpary vaakyarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he
 In aphorism, there is a sense of sentence by sentence
 kumaril bhatta ne nimna shlokon se pratipaadan kiya he - By this word, the form of Bhatt Padaka Orientalism is shown
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki "ananvitavasth" padaarth padon se abhihit hote hai
 Their discovery is only targeted
 atev "anvitabhidhanwaad" kumaril bhatta kaa he, kintu bhatta mat kaa anuvadak anvitabhidhanwaad maanakar jo khandan karte hai, yah uchit nahin he, kyonki unke granthon main uparyukt lekh kii charchaa kahin bhi nahin he
 This is what the word Anavitabhidhan means - the verses are called Anvirtha Bodhan
 atev pad shakti se hi padaarth or vaakyarth donon kaa bodh ho jaataa he
 There is no need to assume additional signs etc
 from the position of power
 vayovruddh purush kisi vastu ko laane le jane ke liye shabd kaa prayog karata he
 The child next to him understands the meaning of the word by hearing the word and seeing the other man carrying and carrying it
 yahi pravriti kaa kaaryatagyaan kaaran he
 In folk, action is also considered as action, similarly in Vedas, Yagadi action is considered as primary work
 yagadi kriya kshanik he or swarg kalantar bhavi he
 Therefore, the said Veda is considered as an object called "apurva," apart from the sentence discussion
 yahan par "ek kaary shabd" kii purvokt do shaktiyaan do arthon main sweekaar kerani padati hai
 One has to accept strength and the other is to be characterized
 usamen bhi alokik kaary main vishesh shakti he, jaisaa vidwaanon main prachlit he - In folk, there is a symptom in action form
 veda main pad hi vaakya hote hai or padaarth hi vaakyarth hota he 
 In this opinion, synonyms, anvay and connivance are all synonymous
 arthath anvit hi anvay main nimitt hota he
 Prabhakar has considered customer eclipse, that proves investigative
 is mat main - "yajet swargkaam:" is vaakya se anvitabhidhan kaa shaabd bodh hota he
 In this darshan, there is only the provision of Yag for heaven
 swarg se abhipraay yah he - jo du:kha se grast na ho tathaa du:kha utpann kii usamen sambhaavna na ho or abhilaashaa ko purna kare use swarg kehete hai
 By means of sentences like "dashapurnamasabhyam swargakamo yajet" etc
, the instrument of heaven has been constituted by Darshanamasam Yag
 yag ko kshanik mana gaya he, kyonki kisi devtaa ke uddeshy se dravya ke tyaag kaa naam yag he
 "indray Idan Na Mama" renounces the psyche business with this sentence
 us kshan main us vyapaar kaa naash ho jaataa he
 The subject of imperfect love is called heaven
 vah kalantar athwa janmaantar main praapt hota he
 This is the rule of philosophy, reason must remain in the disorganized prior moment of Kayapatti, and transient yag birth is not possible in the haphazard predecessor of future self-consciousness
 etdarth ukt shruti ke aadhaar se yag kaa saadhy, swarg kaa saadhan athwa yag kii uttaravastha evam fal kii purvavastha, ye sab ek vastu siddh hoti hai, jise atishay, apurv, yaa yogyata kehete hai
 It has been elaborately analyzed by Kumaril Bhatt in Unreasonable Action
 yaganushthan ke purv purush main swarg ke upbhog karne kii yogyata nahin hoti
 Even before the rituals, there is no ability to give Swargadi fruit and by resolving the inefficiency of the man and the inefficiency of karma, the scriptural ability is now considered to be incomparable
 yatha This is called as pre-emptive or preplanned
 jahaan ek hi pradhan ho vahaan pradhan yag se jo apurv utpann hota use utpatypurv kehete hai
 The phenomena that arise from the organs are called Angaapurava
 angaporesv or pradhanapurv donon milakar parmapurv ko utpann karte hai
 From it, you get the fruit of Swargadi
 kuch yaagon main anek pradhanon se fal hota he
 For example - Darsha has three Yagas and Pournamas also has three Yagas
 yahan teenon pradhanon se utpann honevaale teen utpatypurvo se ek samudaya purv utpann hota he
 a pre-eminent arises from both communities
 abhipraay yah hua ki uparyukt pratham udhaaharan main teen apurv maane jate hai
 In the second example, preterm, premenstrual, preclinical and preclinical, four are considered incomplete
 ye hi mimasakon kaa sarvasv he
 In it Bhatt Mimansak Shabar Bhasya 2
 1
 2 according to "yagen Apurva Kritva Swarga Bhavayet", accomplishes Apoorva with words and with eloquence
 or use lingadi kaa vachya tathaa shabdabodh main mukhya visheshya maanate hai
 Apoorva has been refuted by all philosophers, it is a refutation of speech and precept
 darshan shastron main padaarthvivechna ke liye chaar kotiyaan maani gai hai - Proof theorem theorem
 pramaan - pramaan use kehete hai jisase vishay kaa nishchayatmak gyaan ho or vishay kaa nirdhaaran ho
 Theorem - One who has knowledge through proof is called a theorem
 pramiti - pramaan ke dwaara jis kisi bhi vishay kaa nishchayatmak gyaan ho, use pramiti kehete hai
 Pramata - One who knows theorem knowledge through proof - is called Pramata
 yahan vibhinn bhartiya darshanikon ne gyaan ke vishay main dwividh vichaar kiya he - The authenticity of knowledge is automatically admissible or layer: admissible
 swat: koti main mimasak, vedanti or buddha aate hai
 Layer: Justice, Vaiseshika, Yoga, Jain and Charvak are included in the category
 yahan pramanya shabd se arthtathatv lakshan pramanya samajhnaa chahie, na ki agyatarth gyaapakatv lakshan pramanya
 Chodanalakshanodharm: In the sutra - "naanu Athatabhumapayartha Bruyat Chodana", etc
, the meaning of the subject is explained
 "tachch abadhitatvan, arthnirutho dharm vishesh:, tasya gyanen niruprana"
 Chaudna Sutra's commentary "athaattva Bhootam Artha" refers to the non-objective meaningless religion, which is represented by knowledge
 atev pramanya ko gyananishtha kaha jaataa he
 That layer is generated and layer is admitted
 yah naiyayikon kaa siddhant he
 That is, the material from which knowledge is generated, does not originate from other material, and from which knowledge is acquired, from which knowledge is acquired rather than from other qualities, knowledge is acquired from knowledge
 isse yah aayaa ki gyanotpadak saamagree se bhinn saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or gyaan graahak saamagree se bhinn saamagree ke dwaara pramanya gruhit hota he
 In this opinion, there is both the primordial and the imperfect layer
 yah naiyayik sammat vivechna he
 In the above opinion, Mimansak people tell infidel dosha, due to which knowledge can never be proved valid
 arthath lokvyavahaar vicchhinn ho jayega
 Therefore, knowledge is self-generated and automatically acquired
 abhipraay yah he ki jis samagri se gyaan utpann hota he, usee saamagree se pramanya bhi utpann hota he; or jis saamagree se gyaan gruhit hota he usee saamagree se pramanya bhi gruhit hota he
 This is the self-authenticity of the Authentic Mimanskadikas, which Kumaril Bhatt has endorsed in his treatise Bhatta Vartika with many tips - yahan bhattamat main gyaan anumey he
 Something excessive arises in the subject of knowledge, from which it is known
 isse gyatata naamak ek dharm ghatadi vishay main utpann hota he, jise practyam, bhasana, prakaash: aadi shabdon se kaha jaataa he
 From this it came to be known that knowledge is derived from the presumption of gender
 isi se pramanya kaa bhi grahan hota he
 Knowledge itself is light in Prabhakarism
 at: gyaan se hi gyananishtha pramanya kaa bhi grahan hota he
 Therefore, the automatic belief is the same in both opinions, which are discussed in detail in "shloka Vartika", "case Panjika", "nyaya Ratnamala"
 pratyaksh anumaanadi se anavgat arth ke bodhak vaakya ko vidhi kehete hai
 That is, the name of the sentence which is unknowable, objectionable promoter
 vidhyarth ke sambandh main mimasakon ke do paksh hai - ek pravartana ko vidhyarth maanata he
 Almost all the parents come here
 doosraa kaary ko vidhyarth maanata he
 This is Prabhakar's theory
 is paksh main is prakaar kaa utpaadan hota he - Promoters in folk, Acharya or Raja use the sentence "gamanay" etc
 to instill their disciples or acts
 shishy yaa bhrity ukt vaakya ko sunakar uske arth kaa anusandhan karata he
 After this, "gavanayan" comes into the act
 isliye pravartak purush kaa jo abhipraay vishesh he, use lok main vidhyarth kehete hai
 It is the action of man who lives in man
 atev ise purushabhipraay bhi kehete hai
 The Vedic Lingadis cannot be called Purushabhipraya because Vedas are apaurusheya
 at: purush ke sthaan par lingadi shabd kaa prayog hota he
 His business specialty is the same
 shabdanishth hone ke kaaran ise shabdi bhaavana bhi kehete hai
 It has been characterized as "purushaapravakanutika: Promoter Lingadinishtho trade especially: Shabdi Bhavna"
 shaastra main ise hi pravartana, prerana aadi kaha gaya hai
 There are two types of instincts in the world - first, the male instincts by his will
 dwitiya pravartak purush, athwa shabd ke dwaara vyakti pravrutt hota he, jise "prerana janya" kehete hai
 Where there is a tendency after inspiration, enlightenment is considered to be the promoter, which Mandan Mishra, Parthasarathi Prabhriti scholars have considered as "favors"
 nyaay sudhakar ne ise alokik dharm vishesh mana he
 Prabhakar Mishra has considered working knowledge towards the tendency, which leads to obsolescence etc
 at: "chodana lakshano dharm:" sutara main likhaa he - "acharya chodith" karomi" is bhashya kii vyakhya karte hue shalikanath ne kaha he - chodith: pravartit:, kaaryamvabodhit: ityarth:, kaaryatagyaan vina pravriterasambhavaditi" atev prabhakar mat main kaha gaya he - "kaary vidhyarth:, tachch kaary dhatvarthatiriktam, apurv shabd vachyam tadev vidhyarth iti" Four types of methods have been presented in the philosophy of Mimamsa, which is for the decision of the Vedas
 uttpattividhi : jis vaakya se karm swaroop kii katrtavyata prathmat: vidit hoti ho use utpattividhi kehete hai
 For example, "agnihotra Juhoti" means to get favored from a house called Agnihotra
 viniogvidhi : angapradhan kaa sambandh jis vidhivaakya se gyaat hota he, use viniogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, "dadhna Juhoti" explains the meaning of havana with curd
 isamen dadhi saadhan he or home saadhy he
 Here the relation of the word appropriation should be understood in the appropriation method
 vah sambandh saadhy-saadhan-bhav, angangi bhav athwa sheshsheshi bhav main samaapt hota he
 Experimental method: One who makes sense of order in the ritual of head and organ is called experiment
 udaahranarth prayajadi ang se upakrit pradhan darshapurnmaas yag se swarg kii prapti hoti he
 It is with this intent that the symptom is described as "anganam serial method; Methodology:" adhikaravidhi : jis vidhi se karmjanya fal kaa bhokta karta ko mana jaataa ho use adhikaravidhi kehete hai
 For example, "yajet Swarga Kama:" The one who is the priest here is the one who is the bearer of heaven
 isi prakaar se apurv vidhi, niyam vidhi or parisankhya vidhi ke bhed se teen prakaar kii vidhiyaan prasiddh hai - There are two types of methods mentioned above, it should be understood in this way that the origin, appropriation experiment and authority law are all around in the invention
 niyam tathaa parisankhya vidhi, viniyog vidhi main hi antargat he
 Special knowledge of this subject is visible in Bhatt Chintamani

 Open kilns, like pajavas, ardh anwarat, Relentlessly inamen se antim ke kai vibhaag kiye ja sakate hai, jaise gheredaar, ytaakar, upar hawa khinchnewala, neeche hawa khinchnewala, ityadi
 Drying is made from wet clay, then a group of raw bricks collected at a distance from each other is called heap to get the full effect of the heat
 acchhee reeti se bane dher main ek ytaakar yaa samalamb chaturbhujakar farsh hota he jo lambaai ke anudish dhaalu hota he
 The lower end is made by digging the ground one foot deep, and the upper end is leveled and elevated

 a two-foot, thick fold is placed on the floor of an instant fire catcher, such as dry grass, chaff, dung, cow dung, mahoo seetha etc

 Bricks and firewood are then placed one after the other
 jyon-jyon dher unchaa hota jaataa he, jalaavan ke str kii motaai ghire-dhire kam kar di jaati he
 After everything is filled, wet soil is left on the pile so that the heat inside remains as far as possible
 dher ko purnataya jalane main chah se lekar aath saptaah tak lag jate hai or iske thanda hone main bhi itnaa hi samay lagata he
 In this manner the firewood seems low enough; But bricks are not able to be good matches; Therefore, this method does not prove beneficial in the end
 ardh anwarat bhatthe chakrakaar athwa ytaakar banaae jate hai or ve anshat: yaa purnat: bhoomi ke upar rah sakate hai
 Wood can be used for firewood, half-baked charcoal or charcoal from furnaces of large engines
 donon ore munh bana rahata he jo nikaalane or bharne ke kaam aata he
 After igniting the fire, these mouths are first covered with holes and dhoks and later by wet soil in which the inner heat remains inside
 anwarat bhatthe kai prakaar ke haate hai
 Some are built under the ground and are called trench kilns
 kuch anshat: bhoomi ke upar or anshat: neeche banaae jate hai
 There is no need to construct side walls in trench kilns

 There is a diluent in the ventilator smoke that can control the airflow
 nikasiwale dhuankas main bhi mandak laga rahata he jise icchaanusaar kholaa yaa band kiya ja saktaa he
 The order of the chambers is such that hot air from cold or hot chambers can be sent to other chambers

 The collections of these artifacts, in the view of ea's architect, adequately summarize an 'enterprise' level architectural description or description of useful methods of enterprise structure

 An enterprise architecture framework collects the tools, techniques, artifact descriptions, process models, reference models, and guidance used by the architect in detailing the enterprise-specific structure
 udhyam sanrachana ruparekha se sambandhit lekh kii jaankaree ke liye aage dekhen
 In 1992, Steven Spewock described the process of creating an enterprise structure that is widely used for educational courses
 kai udhyam sanrachana ruparekha udhyam sanrachana ke abhyaas ko bhang kar bhinn kshetron yaa prakshetron main baant dete hai
 In his book on enterprise structure, Spewock divides practice at 'level 2' into two areas: "business Modeling" and "current Systems and Technology" and at three Level Subordinate Areas at 'level 3': "data Structure", " Application Structure "and" Structure Technology "
 The final level of Spacewalk's EAP is the "implementation" or "footsteps" level, which discusses how to "migrate" the enterprise to match the new model
 lokapriy togaaf ruparekha abhyaas ko teen kshetra main vibhajit karata he: "vyapaar sanrachana", "soochna pranali sanrachana" or "praudyogiki sanrachana" or phir soochna pranali sanrachana ko "jaankaree sanrachana" or "aavedan sanrachana" main upavibhajit karata he
 The strategic structure model allows for up to ten flexible partitions that encompass many aspects of an enterprise's projects and goals through the software applications and technology of the project and program
 kai kshetron main abhyaas kaa vibhaajan udhyam vaastukar ko kai mahatvapurn drushtikon se udhyam kii vyakhya karne kii anumati detaa he
 This practice also encourages the contribution of many individuals and allows them to make better use of distinct domain-specific skills and knowledge
 From this point of view, enterprise architects can ensure to produce an overall description
 lokapriy or sabase aam chaar anukshetra or unke ghatak hisse is tarah dikhegein: The main purpose of the description of the enterprise structure is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business

 The use of this method of information to improve business function as described in the Togeaf Structure Framework includes the development of "architectural vision": a description of the business that represents a "goal" or a "goal to be achieved in the future" Does

 The action by which the informed businessman does and the fruit of it also falls on the doer is called intransitive verb

 The noun or adjective is added to complete the meaning of the imperfect transitive verb, it is called fulfillment
 jaise- gandhi kahalaaye
 - It does not give the desired meaning
 arth samajhane ke liye yadi poocha jaay ki gandhi kya kahalaaye? to uttar hoga- gandhi mahatma kahalaaye
 Thus, the meaning of the imperfect intransitive verb is pronounced by the word Mahatma
 is vaakya main kahalaaye apurna akarmak kriya or mahatma shabd purti he
 Other examples: 1
 meraa bhai shikshak ho gaya
 2
 Gold is yellow

 jis akarmak kriya kaa puraa aashay spasht karne ke liye vaakya main karm ke saath anya sangya yaa visheshan kaa purti ke rup main prayog hota he, use apurna akarmak kriya kehete hai
 Like- the king made Gangadhar a minister

 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he
 Note 1: Anticipated market returns are often estimated by taking a geometric average of the value of historical returns in a market-portfolio
 note 2: jokhim kii gananaa hetu prayukt 'jokhim mukt pratifal dar' praayah etihasik daron kaa arithmetic ausat hota he naa ki vartmaan dar

 siepiem ko amaap adhivetan or vishisht jokhim shaamil karne ke liye sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 This is important for investors who do not have an advanced-diversified portfolio
 sameekaran parmparik siepiem sameekaran ke samaan hi he “jisamen bazaar jokhim adhivetan ko beta utpaa or bazaar jokhim adhivetan ke guna se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he:”:5 "where: pratibhuti bazaar rekha siepiem ke formula kaa graph ke rup main chithran karti he
 show the risk on the x axis and the expected return on the y axis
 bazaar jokhim kaa anumaan pratibhuti bazaar rekha kii dhalaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph
 yadi jokhim va pratifal kaa paraspar chithran rekha se upar hota he to iskaa arth he ki yah pratibhuti sasti mil rahi he or is par adhik laabh kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 If it falls below the illustration line, then the price should be considered expensive and it will not get as much profit as the risk is being taken
 siepim kaa upyog karte hue pratyaashit / vaanchhit labhdar e { \ displaystyle E} gyaat hone ke pashchaat isaki tulana sampatti ke anumaanit pratilabh dar se karke yah pataa laga sakate hai ki yah nivesh acha rahegaa ki nahin
 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc
 siepiem ke anusaar, yadi anumaanit mulya, sampatti ke siepiem dwaara sujhai dar ke saath samyojit kiye gaye bhavishya nakadapravaah ke baraabar he - to sampatti sahi mulya par mil rahi he
 If the estimated value is higher than the CAPM valuation, the property is cheaper
 kisi parisampatti kaa pratibhuti bazaar rekha par sthit nahin hona uske mulya main visangati ko darshata he
 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio
 siepiem dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht sampatti ke tulanaatmak jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski apekshit vaapasi arthath samaayojan dar, kitni honi chahie
 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate
 yah prachlit anaupchaarik dharna, ki adhik jokhim lene vaale niveshak adhik pratifal kii ichha rakhte hai, ke anuroop hi he
 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements
 kisi bhi portpholio main maujuud jokhim pramukhtah do prakaar ke jokhimon kaa yoga hota he - vyavasthaatmak jokhim, jise bazaar jokhim yaa ashaakhneey jokhim bhi kaha jaataa he, tathaa avyavashthaatmak jokhim jise shaakhneey jokhim kaha jaataa he
 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context — ie its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness — as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance ie less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risky and risk free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios with effective limits: some cash with higher returns - more efficient - rather than just low-return portfolios at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is the market portfolio
 sabhi niveshkon: The bi-beta model distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta
 siepiem tathaa dwi-beta model main antar yah he ki siepiem model kii manyata he ki urdhvagami or adhigami beta ek hi hai jabaki dwi-beta model esa nahin maanata
 AC validation is rarely correct, so a bi-beta model is considered more appropriate
