 One day in Arizona, he races with a high school quarterback

 The incident nearly leads Sheen to prison and her mother decides that she will not relocate, so she sends Sheen to Tokyo, Japan, who is a United States Navy officer stationed there
 tokyo main apane pita ke ghar pahunchane par uske pita chetavanee dete hai ki vah kisi samasya main na pade anyathaa usko waapas sanyukt rajya jaakar jail main samay vyateet karnaa padegaa
 At her private school, Sheen meets Twinkie, an American herself, who sells used imported goods to her Japanese classmates

 Soon Sheen is introduced to Takashi, also known as DK, and his friend Han Lu, who grew up in the United States
 taakashi sheen ko apni australian mahila mitra nila se baat karte dekh letaa he or jab vah use nila se dur rahane ko aagaah karata he to sheen usko res ke liye lalkaarta he
 Due to Sheen's low drifting skills Takashi easily beats him with his brown and black Nissan 350Z and Han's Nissan S15 is destroyed by Sheen
 agle din, haan sheen se skool ke baad miltaa he or usase kahata he ki uski car ko hue nuksaan ko chukaane ke liye sheen ko uske liye kaam karnaa chahie
 sheen ko jaldi hi maaloom ho jaataa he ki haan taakashi ke saath ek vyapaarik saajhedaari main shaamil he
 Han becomes Sheen's friend and when Sheen leaves his father's house, he teaches him to take drift under his protection, as well as give him a red Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX and some financial support for the race
 haan aisa isliye karata he kyonki sirf sheen hi he jo ki taakashi se darataa nahin he 
 sheen dhire-dhire drift main apni pratishtha sthapit karata he or nila uski mitra ban jaati he, jo sheen kii sahpaathee bhi he
 Neela states that she was also considered a gaijin like Sheen, who is not Japanese in origin
 vah bataati he ki uski maa ki mrityu ke pashchaat vah or taakashi ek saath hi bade hue hai
 However, when Takashi sees Sheen with Neela and realizes that they spend a lot of time together, Takashi beats Sheen and warns him to stay away from Neela
 sheen kii chot ke nishaanon ko dekhne ke baad nila taakashi ko chhod detii he or sheen ke saath rahane lagati he
 Takashi's uncle Kamata, a well-known Yakuza tells him that there is some discrepancy in the accounts and that Han must be cheating them with money
 is visangati ko lekar taakashi haan or uske dal se bhid jaataa he or taakashi ke avaidh dhan ke maamle ko samajhane se pehle hi haan, sheen or nila vahaan se bhaag jate hai
 Takashi and his trusted partner Morimoto chase Han, Sheen and Neela in a car between Tokyo
 peechha karne ke dauraan, haan kii car ek chauraahey par duusari car se takaraakar palat jaati he
 By the time Sheen and Neela approach Han's Mazda RX-7, a dripping gasoline fires up and explodes into a car in which Han dies
 taakashi kaa saathi morimito bhi ek anya car se takaraane ke baad mar jaataa he
 Sheen and Neela return to their father's house where Takashi arrives to take Neela and kill Sheen
 isse pehle ki vah aisa kar paata, sheen ke pita hastkshep karte hai
 Neela voluntarily leaves with Takashi
 chunki sheen ne tokyo main pareshaaniyaan paidaa kar deen thi, uske pita use apana saamaan lekar desh chhodane ko kehete hai, lekin sheen unase gidgidaata he ki use in samasyaon ko sulajhane diya jaye
 Sheen meets Twinkie who gives him a bag full of money that Han had grabbed from Kamata
 sheen paristhiti ko sanbhaalane kaa prayaas karata he, vah kamata se aagrah karata he, uske paise waapas kar detaa he or taakashi ko ek "honor res " kii chunauti detaa he, is dwand main jo bhi haaregaa, vah shahar chhod kar chalaa jaayegaa
 yah res ek toge par he jisame taakashi ko badhat hasil he kyonki vahi ek vyakti he jo isamen neeche tak surakshit aa chukaa he
 Since all the cars have been confiscated by the police, Sheen and his troupe use the RB26DETT engine of the Sylvia S15 that Sheen destroyed in his first race
 sheen, tvinki or haan kaa dal, apane pita kii car, ek kaali 1967 ford mastang fastbake, lekar usapar kaam karte hai
 After installing the Nissan engine and making some improvements, as well as doing a test race on the mountains, the old Mustang is fully ready for the race
 pahaado main ek lambe res -yuddh ke baad, sheen jeet jaataa he, jabaki taakashi antim kshanon main ek durghatana se batch jaataa he
 Takashi's defeat causes him great humiliation because he still considers Sheen to be an "outsider"
 kamata sheen ko kahata he ki vah swatantra he or taakashi sambhawatah tokyo chhod detaa he

 It is clear that in the film it would have been much easier that the surface damage of the S15 would have been corrected rather than applying the RB26 to the Mustang, especially when the incomplete Mustang was compared to the higher-capacity S15
 Criticism grew when it was revealed that the car rarely appeared on screen and the Mustang used for drifting scenes was powered by 351cid Windsor V8 engines

 Destroyer or Destroyer - In maritime / naval language, destroyer ships are fast-moving warships
 inkaa avishkaar 20veen sadi ke praarambhik varshon main hua or tabhi se nausenayuddh main isak sthaan bejod rahaa he
 It has a unique place in the history of the Navy due to the successful carrying out of multifaceted and reliable tasks
 at: iskaa ateet, vartmaan or bhavishya adhyayan karne yogya he
 It is certain that the destroyer was invented by torpedoes
 tarpedo ne nausenayuddh main kranti laa di
 This was the first time a small ship equipped with a torpedo could take a front from a large navy and destroy it
 nausainik samartantr main is krantikari avishkaar se chote jahaajon kaa vikaas aavashyak ho gaya
 There were two reasons for this : in kaarnon se hi vinaashak kaa avishkaar hua
 In the early ruptures, called "torpedo nostrils", there were only two torpedo tubes
 shatru ke dhwanskon par akraman karne ke liye inpar aage kii ore ek top arudh hoti thi
 These ships were very small, with displacement of 200 to 300 tons
 samay bitne par dhwansak kaa prabhaav badhaane ke liye usapar adhikadhik tarpedo ladanaa aavashyak samajha gaya
 The number of torpedo tubes gradually increased, and by the time of World War II, eight nozzles on two mountings were humanized
 akramak asron main hawaii jahaaj kaa pravesh hote hi dekha gaya ki hawaii akramanon se bachaav ke liye dhwansak par havamar top kaa rahanaa aavashyak he
 Initially, the general machine gun was installed on the destroyer, but such small guns did not have destructiveness, so later amphibious guns were installed
 pandubbi kaa vikaas hone par vinaashak par ek kaam or aa padaa
 That was, finding and destroying submarines
 iske parinamswaroop dhwansak pandubbimaar astr bhi dhone lage
 This was bound to increase the size and extent of the destroyer
 pratham vishwayuddh ke purv jahaan vinaashak keval 300 din ton visthaapan ke hote the vahaan aaj 2,000 ton se adhik visthaapan ke vinaashak banane lage hai
 There have been many radical improvements in destroyers over the last few decades, but its basic features, such as high speed and maneuvers, have not differed
 tej gati ke abhaav main bade bade jahaajon par akraman karte samay vinaashkon ke batch nikalne kii sambhaavna kam rah jaati he
 Their amazing ability to be protected at sea is due to their streamlined shape and design
 dhwansak main jo astr-shastr rahete hai ve teen shreniyon main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai : 1
 torpedoes to attack ships, 2
 pandubbi par akraman ke liye asr shasr, 3
 Amphibious cannons for fighting aircraft and small ground forces
 yon to vinaashak kaa nirmaan hi bade jahaajon par tarpedo se akraman karne ke liye hota he, tathaapi aadhunik nausenayuddh main tarpedo akraman ke avasar kam hone ke kaaran tarpedo kaa mahatv dhire-dhire ghat rahaa he
 But it cannot be said that the days of the torpedo attack are now over
 peechha karanevaale or lautanevaale tarpedo ke aagaman se jahaajwahit tarpedo ke din phir laut sakate hai
 According to some people, the submarine has developed so much that it cannot be destroyed by the destroyer
 yadhyapi kuch seemaa tak yah kathan satya he phir bhi nikat pareekshan se prakat hota he ki aaj bhi vinaashak pandubbi ko maarane main samarth he
 In the last World War, 300 submarines were submerged by the destroyers
 ab to sudurastha lakshvedhi astron or sudhari hui swananvesh yuktiyaan uplabdh hai, jinase vinaashkon kii shakyata bahut bad gai he
 Submarines torpedoes containing drone helicopters and rockets have greatly increased the ability to search and destroy submarines
 samudri jahaajon ke liye hawaii akramanon kaa sankat bad jane se uske nirakaranarth hawamaron kii shakyata badhanaa swabhaavik tha
 But even radar controlled and instant hit cannons cannot protect against aerial accidental aircraft
 top ke sthaan par niyantrit missile kaa prayog hone par, jaisaa ant main hoga, dhwansak pehle ke samaan hi prabal ho jaayenge
 The destroyers are the most trusted parts of the fleet
 pichley mahayuddh main dhwanskon ne sab prakaar kaa kaary kiya tha
 They hid the task forces, escorted the convoys, transported the initial survey teams, hid the waterfront ghats, rescued casualties in the war and dispensed postage
 saath hi lagbhag 300 pandubbiyon ko bhi dubaaya
 They ranged from warships located at the very bottom of the water to cruisers, destroyers and petrol vessels
 dhwanskon kaa bhavishya ujjwal maaloom hota he
 In future these carriers will be an essential part of Kritik Sen
 ye krithik sena ke parichayan paraas ko paryaapt badhaakar tathaa vaahak hawaii gashat kaa niyantran karke hawaii pratiraksha ko sudrudh karege
 Only the submarine can destroy the fast ships
 uttam pandubbimaar asron se las dhwansak khojane maarane kii karrwai main bejod honge
 The destroyer has proved to be a very useful ship even today in the maintenance work
 bhavi dhwansak kaise honge, isaki pariklpana hi kii ja sakati he, par aadhunik jhukaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah pariklpana bahut kuch yatharth hogi
 The future destructor will almost certainly operate with nuclear power, since nuclear power will be the only means by which the tolerance of the destructor can be increased
 bhavishya main dhwansak kii sahansheeltaa mahatv kaa kaary karegi, isamen koi andeh nahin, kyonki krithik sena ko hafton tak samudr main rahanaa pad saktaa he
 It will also be necessary to increase the speed of the destroyer
 bhavi dhwansak saralata se 50 note kii chaal se chal sakegaa
 It will be necessary to reduce the torpedo weapons
 par dhwansak main pandubbimaar tarpedo rah sakate hai
 These would have rockets, the active tips returning to the torpedoes, such that they could be filled with tubes by the string
 topon ko purnataya hataa dena padegaa or unke sthaan par tal-se-tal vaale niyantrit missile lage rahenge
 There will also be drone helicopters on the destroyers
 saranshat: naveenatam kism ke pandubbimaar astron, aadhuniktam kism kii khoj karanevaali yuktiyon or niyantrit missile kii badariyon se yukt dhwanskon kaa kaary bhavi yuddh main bahut hi mahatvapurn hoga

 Inspection of different types of fossils shows that different types of animals have occurred in different periods on Earth
 pracheenatam jeevashm nikshepon main keval saralatam jeevon ke avshesh upasthit hai kintu abhinav nikshepon main kramshah adhik jatil jeevon ke avshesh praapt hote hai
 As we study ancient times from ancient to ancient times, fossils seem to be very similar to living organisms
 anek madhyavarti lakshanon vaale jeev bataate hai ki saral rachana vaale jeevon se jatil rachana vaale jeevon kaa vikaas hua he
 Most of the fossils are not archival but almost complete series of fossils of horse, camel, elephant, man etc
 have been unearthed which provide solid evidence of organic growth
 jeevashm ko angreji main fossil kehete hai
 The word originates from the Latin word "fossilus", which means "digger
" saamaanya: jeevashm shabd se ateet kaal ke bhoumikeey yugon ke un jaev avasheshon se taatpary he jo bhuparpati ke avsaadee shailon main paae jate hai
 These fossils reveal that they are of biological origin and have biological evidence in themselves
 praaniyon or padpon ke jeevashm banane ke liye do baton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The first essential thing is that it is very important to have skeletons, or some kind of rigid limbs, which can be preserved in the rocks as fossils
 jeevon ke komalang ati sheeghra vighatit ho jane ke kaaran jeevashm dasha main parirakshit nahin rah sakate
 In the geological ages, there were many communities of organisms on Earth that did not have any rigid organs or skeletons in their bodies, so fossilists are deprived of the study of groups of such organisms, because no part of them is found to be preserved in fossil form
 To study
 at: jeevashm vigyaan kshetra unheen praaniyon tathaa padpon ke virgon tak simit he jo fossil banane ke yogya the
 The second essential thing is that the skeletons or hard organs should be covered immediately with sediments to avoid decay and disintegration
 thalwasi jeevon ke sthaayee samadhisth hone kii sambhaavna ati viral hoti he, kyonki sthal par aise bahut kam sthaan hote hai jahaan par avsaad satat bahut badi maatra main sanchit hote rahete hon
 In very rare circumstances, the hard parts of the living organisms have been found to be shielded due to the sand being pressed into the sand or by landslides
 jalawaasi jeevon ke fossil hone kii sambhaavna atyadhik anukool isliye hoti he ki avsaadan sthal kii apeksha jal main hi bahut adhik hota he
 Even in these aquatic sediments, a large number of fauna remains are found in aquatic sediments that form in the womb of the sea, because the sea is the site where sedimentation is the most frequent
 vibhinn virgon ke jeevon or padpon ke kathor bhaagon ke aakaar or rachana main bahut bhed hota he
 In insects and hydra classes the hard parts are of a substance called chitin, many sponges and diatoms are made of sand, vertebral bones mainly contain calcium carbonate and phosphate, corals, echinodermata, mollusca and many other creatures
 And some plants contain calcium carbonate and other plants mostly consist of wood tissue
 in sab padaarthon main se kytin badi kathinaayee se ghulaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sand, when it is emitted by animals, dissolves very quickly
 yahi kaaran he ki baaluu ke bane kankal bade sheeghra ghul jate hai
 In calcareous skeletons, lime carbonate dissolves very quickly in water containing carbonic acid, but the solubility varies according to the amount of carbonate of lime
 churniy kankal kailcite athwa eregonite ke bane hote hai
 Of these, calcite shells are more durable and durable than aragonite shells
 adhikansh praaniyon ke kavach kailcite athwa eregonite ke bane hote hai
 The fossils preserved in sedimentary rocks are of the following types: sampurna parirakshit praani - aisa bahut viral hota he ki bina kisi prakaar ke vighatan ke kisi praani kaa jeevashm praapt ho, kintu aise parirakshit jeevashm ke udhaaharan maimath or rhinosiris ke jeevashm hai, jo tundra ke him main jame hue paae gaye hai
 Skeletons often found preserved in unchanged condition - Sometimes when only the skeleton is shielded in the shells, it has been seen that it is in its former state, when it was in the tomb
 parivartan keval itnaa hota he ki fossil dasha main kankal se carbonic dravyon kaa lop ho jaataa he
 Carbonization - In some plants and some animals, such as graptolite, which consists of skeletal chitin, the basic material is carbonized
 jeev main aghatan hota he, jiske falswaroop oxigen or nitrogen kaa lop ho jaataa he or carbon rah jaataa he
 Skeletal mold - Sometimes skeletons or armor disappear and only their mold remains in their place
 yah is prakaar hota he ki kavach ke avsaad se dhak jane ke uparaant, kavach kaa aantarik bhaag bhi avsadwale dravya se bhar jaataa he
 After this, carbonic acid mixed water leaks into the rock to reach the point where the shell remains buried and completely dissolves it as bicarbonate of calcium
 iske parinamswaroop kavach ke sthaan par kavach ke aantarik or bahya aakaar kaa keval ek saanchaa dekhne ko miltaa he
 The space between these two was originally armor and if this space is filled with wax, then the true structure of the armor is found
 ashmibhavan - kabhi kabhi fosilon main un jeevon ke, jinke ye fossil ho gaye hai, sookshm aakaar tak dekhne ko milte hai
 The only difference is that the original substance of the skeletons is replaced by a mineral
 is kriya ko ashmibhavan kehete hai
 The best example of Ashmi Bhavan is Ashmibhut wood which is seen in the same way as the wood of living plants
 yah parivartan is prakaar hota he ki jab adikashth kaa ek kan hatataa he tab uske sthaan par turant baaluu athwa anya kisi khanij kaa ek kan aa jaataa he, jisase kashtha kaa aadi aakaar jyon kaa tyon bana rahata he
 The main minerals used to remove the basic material by this method are: carbonate of calcium, sand, iron oxide, iron oxide and sometimes sulfate of calcium etc
 chihn - kabhi-kabhi jeev jantuon ke padchihn bill, chhidr aadi shailon main paae jate hai
 Although they are not part of the rigid organs of animals, and therefore cannot be called fossils, they are thought to be of equal importance as fossils
 jeevashmon ke upyog nimnlikhit hai : Use of Fossils in Correlation of Shells - The organisms that we find today as fossils must have been in a certain period of a geological age
 at: ve hamaare lae bade mahatv ke hai
 It has been well known since William Smith and Cuvay, the father of layered geology, that there is a definite connection between the fossils found in sedimentary rocks and the location of their geological columns
 yah bhalee bhanti pataa lag chukaa he ki shailen jitani alpaayu hongi utana hi unamem praapt praani vibhinn prakaar ke or padpasamudaay jatil hoga or ve jitani dderghaayu hongi utana hi saral or saadhaaran unka jeevashmasamudaay hoga
 Thus, fossils have a prominent place in deciding the level position of rocks and they have proved of great importance
 cambrionpurv ke pracheen shailon main jeevashm nahin paae jate
 Therefore, in the absence of fossils, correlation of these rocks with the help of fossils is not established
 cambrian se lekar aaj tak ke bhoumikeey stambh ke samast bhaagon ke praani or padpon kaa pataa laga liya gaya he
 Therefore, it is now relatively easy to find even parts of these parts in any part of the earth
 jeevashm pracheen kaal ke bhugol ke suchak - purabhugol ke antargat, pracheen kaal ke sthal or samudr kaa vistaran, us kaal kii saritaayen, jhil, maidan, parvat aadi aate hai
 According to a particular environment, organisms adapt themselves to the situation, this is as much in true modern times as it was in the geological ages of the true past
 at: jeevashmon kii sahaayta se ham yah pataa laga sakate hai ki kis sthaan par delta, parvat, nadi, samudratat, chhichley athwa gahare samudr the, kyonki sthal main rahanevaale jeev, jalawaale jeevon se or jal main rahanevaale jeevon main alvan jalawaasi jeev lavan jalawaasi jeevon se sarvatha bhinn hote hai
 Indicators of fossil antecedents - With the help of fossils one can even estimate the extent of climate of geological ages
 is disha main sthal padpon dwaara pradaan kiye gaye pramaan vishesh mahatv ke hote hai, kyonki unka vistaran samudri jeevon kii apeksha adhikanshat: taap ke anusaar hota he or ve saraltapurvak jalwaayu ke anusaar bhinn bhinn bhaagon main pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 Some of the marine organisms expand according to climatic conditions, such as coral, which live in warm climates
 jeevashm jeevvikas ke suchak - jeevashmon ne jeevvikas ke siddhant par bahut prakaash daalaa he or bina jeevashmon kii sahaayta ke jeevvikas kaa anurekhan karnaa asambhav sa he
 The fossils are collected both in terms of fossil and layered rock sciences
 jeevashmon ke sangrah ke samay nimnlikhit baton kaa sadaiv dhyaan rakhana chahie : If the geological composition is short-lived, then all fossils should be collected, whether complete or fragmentary
 yadi jeevashmon kaa nikaalnaa asambhav na ho to kabhi bhi purna jeevashmon ko chhod na dena chahie
 They should be removed easily
 aisa khandamay jeevashm, jisamen savistaar aakaarkiya lakshan milte hon un anek purna jeevashmon se kahin adhik mahatv kaa he, jinamein aakaarkiya lakshanon kaa abhaav ho
 Never try to identify fossils in the area
 yadi jeevashmon kaa sangrah starit-shail-vigyaan kii drushti se kiya gaya ho to alag alag prayek rachana se jeevashmon kaa sangrah aavashyak he
 It is very important to determine from which level the fossils have been stored, because the collection of fossils is often meaningless without knowing it
 iskaa nishchay sugamawa ke saath jeevashmsangrah ke samay kiya ja saktaa he
 Along with the collection of fossils, the main main and distinctive features of stylistic compositions should also be written
 jeevashmsangrah main jeevashm vigyaani ke liye ek halkaa hathaudaa, chheni, choti-choti theliyaan or raddi kaagaj bade upyogi hote hai
 If large fossils are discovered, attention should first be paid to weatherproof levels
 yadi jeevashm yahan nahin dikhaai padate, to haal hi main bhang hue aadhaar main paae jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 If a fossil appears to be lying in a hard rock, one should not attempt to remove it suddenly, but find cracks in its vicinity
 in daraaron se shail ke vah bhaag aasaani se tode ja sakate hai jinamein jeevashm lage hue hai
 In this way, while removing fossils, it should always be kept in mind that hammer on the shell should be run as far as possible from the fossil
 aisa karne se jeevashm ke tuutane kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he or shail sahit jeevashm alag ho jaataa he
 If it is to collect small fossils like Foraminifera, then it is obviously impossible to collect them one by one
 aisi dasha main aabaddh shailon, athwa shail namoonon kaa hi sangrah karnaa uchit hoga
 The material brought in this way is later compiled in the laboratory and when viewed from a hand lens, many small fossils are seen in it, which can be separated from the base with the help of sieve
 kshetra main jeevashmon ke sangrah ke uparaant prayek jeevashm ke saath ek leb laga dena chahie, jisamen do baton kaa ullekh bada aavashyak hota he : vah yatharth str, jisase jeevashm liya gaya he or sthaan kaa naam, jahaan se jeevashm kaa sangrah kiya gaya he
 After doing this, the fossil should be brought to the laboratory, wrapped in scrap paper and tied with a string
 shail aadhaar se jeevashm nikaalane kii vidhi ek prakaar kii kala he
 No firm rules can be told in this regard, because different types of problems arise
 kis vidhi se or kaise jeevashm ko prastar se alag kiya ja saktaa he, isko ek anbhavi jeevashm vigyaani jeevashm ko dekhakar samaj letaa he
 The rock bases in which fossils lay exposed range from soft soil to dense rock, whose hardness can be comparable to steel
 jeevashm kii kathorta kii seemaa main itnaa adhik antar nahin hota
 While extracting fossils, it is the intention of the paleontologist to separate the fossil from the rock without harming it in any way
 yadi aadhaar jeevashm kii apeksha mridu prakruti kaa he, to use sugamawapurvak ek brush kii sahaayta se hataa sakate hai
 If fossils are found in an unconformed limestone, we can also separate it with the help of toothbrush brush
 yadi shail aadhaar chaak prakruti kaa he to danta upkaran main bhramit brush kii sahaayta se use alag kar sakate hai
 On other occasions when fossils are brittle and are firmly attached to the base of the rock, it is difficult to separate the fossils by hammering them
 aisi dasha main prastar ko kai baar garam karke tunrat pani main daal dene se, jeevashmon kaa prastar se algaav saralata se ho jaataa he
 In extracting fossils such as Foraminifera from sand and other limestone rocks, the shell is first broken and then sieved into a variety of sieves
 isamen jeevashm shail bhaag se alag ho jate hai
 When the rocks are hardened, another method is used
 shail ko chote chote tukdon main tod lete hai or phir unako itnaa garm karte hai ki ve purnat: suukh jaaen or phir unako isi garm avasthaa main hi thande pani main daal dete hai
 In this way the hard soil gets decomposed into the mud and then finally the fossils are washed from the stone part and separated
 jab yantric ritiyon se jeevashmon kaa pruthakkaran sambhav nahin hota tab rasinic vidhiyaan prayog main laai jaati hai
 The simplest of these is the method of weathering, which in many cases decomposes the rock base without harming fossils
 bahut hi tanu amla ke upyog main laane se yah kriya shigh ho jaati he
 Here, it would be appropriate to state that acid should be used with great caution, as the cages of most fossils are calcareous and have an immediate effect on the acid
 saadhaarant: costic potash thik prakaar kaa abhikaarak he, jiskaa bina kisi bhay ke upyog kar sakate hai
 Its tiny particles are put in the dry state on the whole shell base which has to be removed
 chunk costic potash prasvedhy prakruti kaa hota he
 Hence, it enters inside the base and decomposes it
 yah ekinoderma, athwa molsk, ko koi kshati nahin pahunchaata
 It should not be used in Brachiopoda, as it is easily inserted into their scaly panes, causing their layers to separate
 ant main jeevashmon ko acchhee prakaar jal se dho daalana chahie
 Separation of shielded graptolite and plant fossils in shale like rocks is done by "transfer method"
 is pruthakkaran kii mukhya mukhya baaten nimnlikhit hai : The bottom of the specimen, which contains the fossils, is glued down to the slide of the slab with the help of canada balasam
 shell kaa jitna bhaag sugamawa se kaata yaa ghisa ja saktaa ho use kaat athwa ghis lete hai
 The shells soak the floor and then submerge it in the melted wax
 mom ardra tal se sugamawa se pruthak ho jaataa he or kaach par koi rasinic kriya nahin hone detaa
 Put the entire fossil containing the shell in the acid of hydrofluoric acid
 yah jeevashm ko tanik bhi kshati pahunchaae bina shell bhaag ko galaa detaa he
 Plant or graptolite fossils should be covered with cover glass after washing
 is prakaar se nikaale gaye graptolite or kuch padap jaise komal jeevashmon ke aadhunik jeevon kii bhanti sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se pariched banaae ja sakate hai
 Rigid fossils can also be made by grinding away
 isamen ghiste samay niyamit avadhiyon par photon lenaa padataa he
 The biggest flaw in this method is that the fossil that is tested with this method is destroyed
 jeevashmon ke pruthakkaran kii uparyukt vidhiyon ke atirikt brackeopoda ke bahukuntalon ke anurekhan ke liye kuch vishesh vidhiyaan hoti hai
 Tracing the suture is also of extreme importance in trilobites, ammonities, and echinodermes by these methods

 paryaavaran shabd kaa nirmaan do shabdon se mil kar hua he
 The "covering" that surrounds us is the "covering" that surrounds us
 paryaavaran un sabhi bhautik, rasinic evam jaivik karkon kii samshtigat ikai he jo kisi jeevadharee athwa paaritantreey aabaadi ko prabhavit karte hai tathaa unke rup, jivan or jivita ko tay karte hai
 In a general sense, it is a unit made up of a set of all biological and abiotic elements, facts, processes and events that affect our lives
 yah hamaare chaaron ore vyaapt he or hamaare jivan kii prayek ghatana isi ke andar sampadit hoti he tathaa ham manushya apni samast kriyaaon se is paryaavaran ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 Thus there is an interdependent relationship between an organism and its environment
 paryaavaran ke jaivik sanghatakon main sookshm jeevanu se lekar keede-makode, sabhi jeev-jantu or ped-paudhe aa jate hai or iske saath hi unase judi sari jaev kriyaayein or prakriyaayein bhi
 Abiotic components include lifeless elements and their associated processes, such as rocks, mountains, rivers, wind and climate elements
 saamanytah paryaavaran ko manushya ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he or manushya ko ek alag ikai or uske chaaron ore vyaapt anya samast chizon ko uskaa paryaavaran ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 But it is also important to note that there are still many human civilizations on this earth, who do not consider themselves separate from the environment and in their view all nature is a single entity
 jiskaa manushya bhi ek hissaa he
 In fact, those who regard humans as separate from the environment are those who are technologically advanced and are able to change their natural conditions drastically by extensive use of science and technology
 maanav hastkshep ke aadhaar par paryaavaran ko do prakhandon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he - prakritik yaa naiysargik paryaavaran or maanav nirmit paryaavaran
 However, a completely natural environment or a completely man-made environment are nowhere to be found
 yah vibhaajan prakritik prakriyaaon or dashaon main maanav hastkshep kii maatra kii adhikta or nunata kaa dyotak maatr he
 In ecology and environmental geography, the term natural environment is also used for habitat
 takneekee maanav dwaara aarthik uddeshy or jivan main vilasita ke lakshyon kii prapti hetu prakruti ke saath vyapak chhedchhad ke kriyakalapon ne prakritik paryaavaran kaa santulan nasht kiya he, jisase prakritik vyavastha yaa pranali ke astitv par hi sankat utpann ho gaya he
 Such problems are called environmental degradation
 paryaavarniya samasyaayen jaise pradooshan, jalwaayu parivartan ityadi manushya ko apni jeevanstyli ke bare main punarvichaar ke liye prerit kar rahi hai or ab paryaavaran sangrakshan or paryaavaran prabandhan kii charchaa he
 How much human being is able to reduce the loss due to scientific and technological changes made by it, how much attention is being paid to the environment in the collision of economic and political interests and how aware of human environment, it is alive today Have questions
 paryaavaran shabd sanskrit bhashaa ke 'pari' upsarg or 'aavaran' se milakar bana he jiskaa arth he aisi chizon kaa samucchy jo kisi vyakti yaa jeevadharee ko chaaron ore se aavrutt kiye hue hai
 In ecology and geography, the term is used as a synonym for the English environment
 angreji shabd environment swayan uparokt paristhitiki ke arth main kaafii baad main prayukt hua or yah shuruuaati daur main aasapaas kii saamaanya dashaon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 It originates from the French language where it used to mean "state of being environed" and its first known use was by Carlyle to convey the meaning of the German word Umgebung in French
 aaj paryaavaran ek jaruri sawaal balki jwalanth mudda bana hua he lekin aaj logon main ise lekar koi jaagrukta nahin he
 Except for rural society, there is not much eagerness in metropolitan life
 parinamswaroop paryaavaran suraksha mahaj ek sarkari agenda hi ban kar rah gaya he
 Whereas, it is a very close question with the whole society
 jab tak iske prati logon main ek swaabhaavik lagaav paidaa nahin hota, paryaavaran sangrakshan ek dur kaa sapana hi bana rahegaa
 The environment is directly related to nature
 apane parivesh main ham tarah-tarah ke jeev-jantu, ped-paudhe tathaa anya sajiv-nirjeev vastuen pate hai
 Together, they create the environment
 vigyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon jaise-bhautik vigyaan, rasayan vigyaan tathaa jeev vigyaan, aadi main vishay ke moulik siddhanton tathaa unase sambandh praayogic vishyon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 But the need of the hour is that along with detailed study of environment, practical knowledge related to it should be emphasized
 aadhunik samaaj ko paryaavaran se sambandhit samasyaon kii shiksha vyapak str par di jaani chahie
 Also, knowledge of preventive measures to deal with it is also necessary
 aaj ke masini yug main ham aisi sthiti se guzar rahe hai
 Pollution stands before us to destroy the entire environment as a curse
 sampoorn vishwa ek gambheer chunauti ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 Although we have a shortage of environmental content, there is no shortage of reference material
 vastav main aaj paryaavaran se sambaddh uplabdh gyaan ko vyaavhaarik banane kii aavashyaktaa he taaki samasya ko janamanas sahaj rup se samaj sake
 In such an uneven situation, it is necessary for the society to realize its duty and responsibility
 is prakaar samaaj main paryaavaran ke prati jaagrukta paidaa kii ja sakati he
 In fact, the living and non-living two components together make up nature
 vaayu, jal tathaa bhoomi nirjeev ghatakon main aate hai jabaki jantu-jagat tathaa padap-jagat se milakar sajivon kaa nirmaan hota he
 An important relationship between these components is that they are interdependent for their sustenance
 jeev-jagat main yadhyapi maanav sabase adhik sachetan evam samvedansheel praani he tathaapi apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti hetu vah anya jeev-jantuon, padap, vaayu, jal tathaa bhoomi par nirbhar rahata he
 Animals, plants, air, water and land found in the environment of human form the environment
 shiksha ke madhyam se paryaavaran kaa gyanshiksha maanav-jivan ke bahumukhi vikaas kaa ek prabal saadhan he
 Its main purpose is to bring physical, mental, social, cultural and spiritual intelligence and maturity within the person
 shiksha ke uddeshyon kii purti hetu prakritik vaataavaran kaa gyaan ati aavashyak he
 The tradition of learning about the natural environment has been there since the beginning in Indian culture
 parantu aaj ke bhautikwaadi yug main paristhitiyaan bhinn hoti ja rahi hai
 While new innovations are happening in various fields of science and technology
 to duusari ore maanav parivesh bhi usee gati se prabhavit ho rahaa he
 It is necessary for the next generation to understand the changes happening in the environment through education
 paryaavaran tathaa shiksha ke antarsambandhon kaa gyaan hasil karke koi bhi vyakti is disha main anek mahatvapurn kaary kar saktaa he
 The environment is closely related to science, but there are no scientific intricacies in its education
 shikshaarthiyon ko prakruti tathaa paristhitik gyaan sidhi tathaa saral bhashaa main samajhaai jaani chahie
 Initially, this knowledge should only be in an introductory manner on the surface
 aage chalakar iske takneekee pahaluon par vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 Knowledge of environment in education is essential for human safety
 paryaavaran apni sampoornataa main ek ikai he jisamen ajaivik or jaivik sanghatak aapas main vibhinn antarkriyaaon dwaara sambhddha or antargumphit hote hai
 This feature gives it the appearance of an ecosystem because ecosystems or ecosystems are interconnected sets of all biological and abiotic elements in an area of the earth
 atah paryaavaran bhi ek paaritantr he
 The largest ecosystem biosphere is considered by scale on Earth
 jaevmandal prithvi kaa vah bhaag he jisamen jeevadharee paae jate hai or yah sthalmandal, jalmandal tathaa vayumandal main vyaapt he
 The entire earth environment is also composed of these units, so in this sense the global environment, biosphere and earth ecosystem become synonymous with each other
 mana jaataa he ki prithvi ke vayumandal kaa vartmaan sanghatan or isamen oxigen kii vartmaan maatra prithvi par jivan hone kaa kaaran hi nahin apitu parinaam bhi he
 Photosynthesis, which is a biological process, has been an important process affecting the formation of the Earth's atmosphere
 is prakaar ke chintan se judi vichaardhaara puri prithvi ko ek ikai gaaya yaa sajiv prithvi ke rup main dekhati he
 In the same way, the study of the effects of ecology on humans and the effects that humans exert on the environment is a major study point of human ecology and human geography
 * yah bhi dekhen: pradooshan or jalwaayu parivartan Most environmental problems are associated with environmental degradation and increased human population and human consumption of resources
 paryaavarniya avanayan ke antargat paryaavaran main hone vaale ve saare parivartan aate hai jo avaanchhneeya hai or kisi kshetra vishesh main yaa puri prithvi par jivan or sandharniyata ko khatra utpann karte hai
 Hence, pollution, climate change, loss of biodiversity and other natural disasters are included in this
 paryaavarniya avanayan ke saath milakar jansankhya main charghaatanki dar se ho rahi vruddhi tathaa maanav dwaara upbhog ke badalte praturup lagbhag sari paryaavarniya samasyaon ke mul kaaran hai
 Resource reduction means the exploitation of natural resources by humans for their economic benefit so fast that they cannot be replenished by natural processes
 vartmaan pariprekshya main sansaadhan ksharan ke liye jansankhya ke dabaav, tej vruddhi dar or logon ke upbhog praturup kaa bhi prabhaav jimmevaar mana ja rahaa he
 Resources are divided into two categories - renewable resources and non-renewable resources
 iske alawa kuch sansaadhan itani paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hai ki unka kshay nahin ho saktaa unhen akshay sansaadhan kehete hai jaise saura urja
 Rapid exploitation of non-renewable resources can end their storage and create difficult conditions for human life
 koyala, petroleum, yaa dhatvithak khanijon ke bhandaron kaa nirmaan ek deergh avadhi kii ghatana he or jis teji se manushya in kaa dohan kar rahaa he ye ek na ek din samaapt ho jaayenge
 On the other hand, some renewable resources are also being used by humans so fast that their natural processes are not possible to be replenished as fast and thus they will also fall under the category of non-renewable resources
 pradooshan athwa paryaavarniya pradooshan paryaavaran main kisi padaarth athwa urja ke pravesh ko kehete hai yadi isaki gati itani tej ho ki saamaanya or prakritik prakriyaaon dwaara iskaa parikshepan, mandan, viyojan, punarchakran athwa ahaanikaarak rup main sangrakshan na ho sake
 Thus there are two clear indicators of pollution, the entry of any substance or energy into the environment and its being harmful or unwanted to the natural environment
 is tarah ke avaanchit tatv ko pradooshak yaa dooshak kehete hai
 Pollution is classified based on the type of pollutant, the source or the part of the ecosystem in which it enters
 udhaaharan ke taur par vaayu pradooshan, jal pradooshan, mrudaa pradooshan, ityadi prakaar is aadhaar par nishchit kiye jate hai ki paaritantr ke is hisse main dooshak tatv kaa pravesh hota he
 On the other hand, types of radioactive pollution, light pollution, noise or noise pollution etc
 are classification based on their own type of pollutant
 === jalwaayu parivartan ===hamaare jivan me hamane bahut saare parivartan dekhe he jal vaayu parivartan unhi me se ek he jal vaayu parivartan ke kaaran hi prithvi par mausam parivartan hota he mausam se hame bahut laabh ho ta he mosum ke bina koi fasal nahi ugaai ja sakati evam naa hi manushya jivan ek mausam me guzaar saktaa he samast jeev dhari ko ko mausam kii jarurat hoti he jalwaayu parivartan se hame laabh bhi he to nuksaan bhi kyonki These include cyclones, strong storms, excessive rain, drought etc
 paryaavaran prabandhan kaa taatpary paryaavaran ke prabandhan se nahin he, balki aadhunik maanav samaaj ke paryaavaran ke saath sampark tathaa us par padane vaale prabhaav ke prabandhan se he
 The three major issues affecting managers are politics, programs and resources
 paryaavaran prabandhan kii aavashyaktaa ko kai drushtikonon se dekha ja saktaa he
 Environment is given special importance in Indian culture
 pracheen kaal se hi bhartiya samskruti main paryaavaran ke anek ghatakon jaise vrikshon ko poojya maanakar unhen puja jaataa he
 Peepal tree is considered sacred
 vat ke vriksh kii bhi puja hoti he
 They are also worshiped as water, air, fire and god
 samudr, nadi ko bhi pujan karne yogya mana gaya he
 Rivers like Ganga, Indus, Saraswati, Yamuna, Godavari, Narmada are worshiped as sacred
 dharti ko bhi mata kaa darja diya gaya he
 Since ancient times, various forms of environment are worshiped in India
 paryaavarniya vidhi athwa paryaavaran vidhi samekit rup se un sabhi antarrashtriya, rashtriya athwa kshetreey sandhiyon, samjhauton or sanvaidhanik vidhiyon ko kaha jaataa he jo prakritik paryaavaran par maanav prabhaav ko kam karne or paryaavaran kii sandharniyata banaaye rakhane hetu hai
 The environmental law in India is regulated by the Environment Act 1986 which is a comprehensive legislation
 isaki rup rekha kendriya sarkaar ke vibhinn kendriya or rajya praadhikaranon ke kriyakalapon ke samanvayan ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he jinaki sthapana pichley kanoonon ke tahat kii gai he jaisaa ki jal adhinium or vaayu adhinium

 He mumbles "there's nothing to do"
 Holding this sentence, Vladimir begins to think, as if 'nothing' is really something big that he has to do throughout the play
 jab estrogan juuta nikaalane main safal ho jaataa he to vah uske bheetar jhaankta he, tathaa vahaan kuch nahin paata
 isse thik purv vladimir apane hat main jhaankta he
 This pattern is repeated throughout the play
 donon mukhya paatr naatak ke dauraan pashchaatap kii baat karte hai, jisamen ve prabhu yishu ke saath cross par taange gaye donon choron kaa zikr karte hai
 It also discusses that only one in four more jalists told that one of the two thieves was saved
 yah charchaa naatak ke dauraan bible se sambandhit anek charchaaon main se ek thi, jo naatak main pratyaksh hoti he
 This shows that the original and hidden subject of the play is God-union and nirvana
 jab-jab donon mukhya paatro ko lagata he godot nikat hai to ve khushi se chilla uthte hai, 'ham batch gaye'
 Vladimir is periodically enraged by Estragon's dialogue ineptitude
 udhaaharan ke liye vah kahata he "are gogo tum kam se kam ek baar to gend vaapis meri ore bhej sakate ho?" bhav se vah estrogan athwa gogo ko apni samvaad kaala sudhaarney ko prerit kar rahaa he
 Gogo seems to struggle in the dialogue arts throughout the play, and Vladimir leads him in dialogue between their mutual and other people
 bich-bich main vladimir gogo ke prati apana aapa bhi kho detaa he, parantu adhiktar donon main ghanishthata rahati he jiskaa pramaan unke maitreepurn aalingan va ek duusare kaa samarthan karne main pratyaksh ho jaataa he
 Estragon looks at the viewing gallery and asks if there is a colorless atmosphere
 vah vahaan se dur janaa chahta he, parantu use yaad dilaayaa jaataa he ki ve pratiksha kar rahe hai
 However, both characters are unable to agree that the time and place of Godot's meeting is today and now
 unako yahan tak spasht nahin he ki aaj koun sa din he
 Time is either constrained or fragmented throughout the play, or does not exist at all
 saare uplakshya main unhen keval ek baat kaa purnagyaan he ki ve ek ped ke nikat milane vaale hai
 That tree is close by
 estrogan so jaataa he parantu vladimir use nahin uthaata kyonki vah nahin chahta ki gogo uth kar apane sapanom ke vrittant se use bor kare
 estrogan uthta he or kisi veshyaghar vaala koi purana haasyaaspad kissa sunanaa chahta he jise vladimir sunaanaa shuru karata he parantu bich main hi use prashaadhan vyavdhaan lenaa padataa he
 On returning, he abandons this anecdote in the middle and asks Estragon what else he should do to spend time
 Estragon proposes that they can hang on the cross, but the idea is abandoned thinking that if one of the two survived, the life of one would be very painful
 In the end, both choose a safe path to do nothing
 estrogan kahata he "yahi surakshit maarg he", or poochta he jab godot aayga to vah kya karegaa
 is par ek baar ke liye vladimir ko bhi kuch nahin sujhata or vah keval itnaa hi kah paata hai: "kuch pakkaa nahin he"
 When Estragon says that he is hungry, Vladimir gives him a carrot
 estrogan ko vah adhik pasand to nahin aati parantu kha letaa he
 This way of spending time also ends and Estragon says we have nothing to do
 donon paatro ke intjaar main ek nayaa mode aata he jab pojo va uskaa bhaar se ladaa das lucky vahaan se guzarate hai
 Lucky's arrival is announced with "a painful cry"
 uski gardan main rassi bandhi he
 He crosses half the stage after which Pojo is seen holding the other end
 pojo apane das lucky par khub chillaata he tathaa use "boar" kahkar pukaarata he, parantu vah estrogan or vladimir ke prati sabhy he
 These two first consider themselves as Godot and do not pay attention to his obstinate and rude behavior
 Pozo gets a little irritated when he considers Godot
 vah unako bataata he ki "sadak par sabhi kaa samaan adhikaar" he
 After this Pozo contemplates relaxation by consuming chicken and alcohol
 jab vah khaakar haddiyaan phenkane lagata he to estrogan unki ore lapakata he
 This makes Vladimir feel very remorseful
 pojo kahata he ki yah haddiyaan lucky ke liye he tathaa estrogan ko lucky se poochna hoga
 estrogan lucky se poochta he or lucky chup rahakar munh jhukaa letaa he
 Assuming it to be "no", Estragon acquires bones
 vladimir pojo ko lucky ke prati nirdayatapurna vyavhaar ke liye pratadit karata he, parantu pojo us par dhyaan nahin detaa
 donon mukhya paatr lucky se poochhate hai ki jab pojo usase koi or kaary nahin karvaa rahaa hota to lucky apana boj neeche kyon nahin rakh detaa
 yah sunakar pojo kahata he ki lucky use prasann karne kii cheshtaa main he, taaki vah use punah na bech de
 yah sunakar lucky rone lagata he
 Pozo hands her the handkerchief, but as Estragon tries to wipe her tears, Lucky bruises on her ankles
 jane se pehle pojo kahata he ki uskaa man bahalane ke liye vah unako kya de saktaa he
 Estragon asks for money, on which Vladimir is a bit angry and says that Pozo will allow Lucky to think a little and dance
 lucky kaa naach purna tathaa avyavasthit hota he
 His "thinking" began with Vladimir placing a cap on his head, only the meaningless dialogue of a man suddenly awakened from sleep
 lucky kaa ekalaap aarambh main to kuch thik hota he parantu baad main purnataya samaj se pare ho jaataa he or vah tabhi ho saktaa he jab vladimir apni hat uske sir se hataa letaa he
 Lucky becomes a slave back and starts packing things as ordered
 pojo or lucky chale jate hai
 At the end of both parts of the play comes a boy who is supposed to be the messenger of Godot
 vah kahata he ki "godot aaj shaam nahin par kal avashya aayega
" vaartalap main vladimir ladke se poochta he ki kya vah kal bhi aayaa tha, jisase pataa chalata he ki donon paatr anant samay se godot ke intjaar main hai or yah bhavishya main bhi anant samay tak chalata rahegaa
 ladke ke jane ke baad vah bhi jane kaa sochate hai parantu is prati koi prayaas nahin karte
 aisa donon bhaagon ke ant main hota he, pardaa girtaa he
 The second part begins with Vladimir humming the song, which relates to a dog and has a broad knowledge of the purpose of the play
 is geet se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki naatak main paramparaagat sangeet, manoranjan va utsav kaa vaataavaran he
 This play is only one of the references and examples related to the Kukkur caste
 isse yah bhi maaloom ho jaataa he ki vladimir ko is aashay kaa abhas he ki jis duniya main vah ulajhaa he, vah utsavmay he 
 vah yah samajhane lagata he ki yadhyapi uski duniya main nishchit samroop vikaas ke kuch pramaan hai tathaapi vah multah nijee jivan ke diwason ko tathaavat doharaa rahaa he
 Concerning the song of Vladimir, Eugene Webb wrote: "the period of the song is not uniformly moving, but it is symbolic of the endless situation whose only eternal end is: death"
 ek baar punah estrogan kahata he ki usne raat ek khai main bitaai or "10 logon ne" peeta - upar se haalanki use koi chot kaa nishaan nahin he
 Vladimir tells him about the seasonal changes happening in the tree and also about the activities of the previous day, but Estragon does not remember much
 Vladimir takes the names of Pozo and Lucky but Estragon only remembers bones and ankle pain
 vladimir ko dhyaan aata hai ki yadi estrogan apni taang dikhaae to use yaad aa saktaa he
 With great difficulty Estragon shows the leg on which the wound has now deepened
 vladimir ko ahsaas hota he ki estrogan ne koi juute nahin pahane hue hai
 The carrot is finished, so Vladimir tells Estragon to choose turnip and radish
 estrogan muuli chunata he parantu kaala hone kii vajah se lautaa detaa he
 Estragon then attempts to sleep in a state equivalent to the previous day's fetus
 Vladimir tells him Lori
 vladimir ko lucky vaali hat najar aati he or vah use pahanane kii sochataa he
 This starts a hat change process
 ve pojo or lucky kaa anusaran karne kii koshish karte hai, parantu estrogan ko kuch bhi yaad nahin aata ki vah pojo va lucky se mila bhi tha ki nahin
 vah bas keval vladimir ke adeshon kaa paalan karata jaataa he
 They both abuse each other and then make up
 uske baad ve kuch shaareerik jatke va ek yogasana karne kaa prayaas karte hai parantu donon vifal ho jate hai
 Pojo and Lucky arrive again
 pojo andhaa ho chukaa he or kahata he ki lucky goonga he
 The rope is now quite short and Lucky is now in the leading guiding role instead of Pozo
 pojo samay kaa abhas kho chukaa he tathaa kahata he ki use nahin yaad ki vah pichley din estrogan va vladimir se mila tha
 He also says that even today's activities will not be remembered tomorrow
 ek samay to sabhi ek ke upar ek gir padate hai
 Estragon thinks this is his chance to avenge being fired and killed by Lucky
 is par lambii charchaa hoti he
 Pozo offers to give them the money, but Vladimir thinks that the mind of both of them is exasperating and both of them are forced to join them in waiting for Godot
 ant main haalanki sab uth khadey hote hai
 Pozo was a proud man in Part 1, but now he has matured a little after blindness
 uske jane ke baad vladimir uske antim shabdon kii vyakhya karata he: "janm kaa sthaan bhi kisi shavgrih ke paas hi hota he, ek kshan kii roshni hoti he phir raat ho jaati he"
 Lucky and Pozo go away
 vahi ladkaa phir aata he or doharaata he aaj godot kii pratiksha naa karen parantu kal vah avashya aayega
 is par niraashaa main donon estrogan kii belt se latak kar aatmahatya kaa prayaas karte hai parantu donon ke bhaar se vah tut jaati he
 Estragon's paint drops but he does not know until Vladimir tells him
 They decide that they will bring a strong rope tomorrow and attempt suicide again, if Godot does not come
 ve phir jane kaa nirnay karte hai parantu iskaa koi prayaas nahin karte
 Beckett has not shed much light on the characters except in the stream of the play
 baket ne kaha tha ki ek baar jab sar ralf richardsan ne apane atyant prabhaavshaalee dhang se pojo, vladimir va anya paatro ke vishay main vistrut jaankaree maangi thi
 Then they just said that
 


 ki inke bare main jo naatak main likhaa he ve keval vahi jaanate hai
 "if i wanted to know more, i would have written in the drama before and this is applicable to all the characters
 " When Beckett started writing the play, there was no image of Vladimir and Estragon in his mind
 na hi usne kahin unako nimna bataaya yaa dikhaaya he
 Roger Blinn explained: "beckett used to hear their voices, but was unable to describe his characters
 vah kahata tha]: 'ki mujhe keval ek baat pataa he ki donon mukhya paatr bowler hai
 "'" Bowler Hat was a popular men's garment in Beckett's hometown foxrock
 bachapan main uski maan usko berat pahanane par tokati thi tathaa bowler hat pahanane ko prerit karti thi jo baket ke pita bhi pahana karte the
 " donon paatro kii shaareerik sanrachana ke vishay main bhi kuch bhi nahin likhaa gaya he; haalanki aisa prathit hota he ki vladimir donon main adhik baari tha
 The impact of Laurel and Hardy becomes apparent to modern audiences as compared to Baller Hat and other ridiculous aspects
 'di comic mind: kamedi and di movies naamak lekh main gerold mast ne is bare main likhaa 'sachai ko paroksh rup main dikhaane ke liye nae praaroop kaa prayog'
 baad main baket ke 1953 main chape apane anya upanyaas wat main laurel va hardi par vishesh tippanee kii
 us upanyaas main baket ne ek swasth jhaadi ko 'ek hardi laurel' yaa 'ek majboot laurel' kah kar sambodhit kiya
 Vladimir stands in almost all the drama while Estragon often sits and falls asleep
 "estrogan shant he jab ki vladimir baichaiyn
" vladimir akaash kii ore dekhakar dharmik va darshanik vishyon ke bare main sochataa he
 On the other hand, Estragon is entangled in everyday things like ordinary men
 vah khaane va dard dur karne jaisi baton se zyada upar nahin ja paata
 vah thodaa bhulakkad bhi he parantu vladimir ke yaad dilaane par use yaad bhi aa jaataa he
 For example, Vladimir asked him "do you remember the Gospel?" On this, Estragon says that he remembers the colored map of that holy place and was about to spend his honeymoon on the Dead Sea
 vastav main uski laghu avadhi kii smriti kamjor thi or shaayad vah aljahaimar se peedit tha
 On the other hand, Al Alvarez writes: "perhaps this forgetfulness helped the two to remain friends
 estrogan bhuulataa he, vladimir yaad dilaataa he tathaa is tarah samay vyateet ho jaataa he
 Both of them have been together for fifty years but when Pozo asked, they refused to give their age
 vladimir ke jivan main bhi anek ksht hai parantu vah donon main sakht jaan he
 "vladimir's pain is mental though
 isiilie vah lucky se bhi apana hat badal letaa he kyonki vah dusron se vichaar vimarsh karnaa chahta he
 " pur naatak ke dauraan donon ek duusare ko "didi" va "gogo" kah kar sambodhit karte hai, haalanki ek ladke ne vladimir ko bhi "mistar albert" kah kar pukaara
 baket ne aarambh main estrogan ke liye levi naam chunaa tha, parantu pojo ke poochne par vah apana naam "magaragore aadre" bataata he
 At the same time, he continued to be called the French name "katule" or "cutule", especially in the earlier "faber edition"
 In the American version it became "adam"
 baket ne keval itnaa kaha ki ve "katulas se ub" gaye the
 a critic named Vivian Mercer said that the drama Waiting for Godot set the record for making an impossible seeming thing possible
 ek naatak jisamen kuch nahin ghatata, magar phir bhi darshak ekagra hokar ise dekhte hai
 Not only this, the second part is a slightly different form of the first part, so Beckett has written a wonder where nothing happens twice
 "- The newspaper questioned and wrote the language of the two main characters in this edition
 "perhaps Beckett sarcastically, how can you say that he is a ph
d
 Are not? 'how do you know that he has ph
d
 Haven't done it? ' His reply was "they must have had a good past, though only known, they had once gone to the Eiffel Tower, and once to the vineyard on the banks of the Rhys River
 The first theatrical staging, which Beckett himself monitored, featured the two chiefs
 The clothes of the characters are not dirty, but a bit ordinary
 udhar estrogan dwaara bag va haddiyaan maangane par vladimir thodaa bhadak jaataa he jisase gyaat hota he ki use vyavhaar uchit hone kaa abhas rahata tha
 " haalanki baket ne paatro kii prishthbhumi ke vishay main kuch nahin likhaa parantu naatak main kaam karne vaale abhinaytaon ne apni-apni prerana talash lee he
 Marthe Gottier, a doctor friend of Jean Martin's, used to work at Salpatrière Hospital and Martin asked her: "listen, Marthur, where can you find a description and explanation of this play that speaks of a certain voice?" Told: In this disease, the hands, feet of the patient start to tremble and slowly he cannot even speak without trembling
 i then said that i want this
 Beckett and Rajar were a little less confident but still agreed
 "jab martin ne baket se kaha ki ve lucky ke paatr ko ek parkisns marij kii tarah karenge to baket ne kaha "avashya"
 baket ne yah zikr bhi kiya ki marco kii yahi beemaari thi
 But then soon the subject changed
 " jab baket se poocha gaya ki lucky kaa naam aisa kyon rakhaa gaya to unhone kaha ki vah "lucky bhaagyashaalee he ki uski koi aakankshaayen role nahin he" Some assessments even state that because "DD and Gogo's relationship was not fully described or established", Lucky and Pozo are one of them
 pojo or lucky ke rishte main pojo kaa prabhutv asal main bemaani tha
 It is known from careful observation that Lucky's influence was always greater
 vah naachata tha or pojo ke khalipan ko dur karne ko sochataa bhi tha
 So from the first time Pozo was actually a slave of Lucky
 yah baat pojo bhi sweekaar karata he ki lucky ne use samskruti, vinay or tarkshiltaa pradaan kii he
 His curiosity came naturally
 pojo kaa party vrittant ek acha udhaaharan he: jab uski smriti jaati rahati he to vah is vakrapatutaa ko bhi kho detaa he
 The only thing known about Pojo is that he was going to the fair to sell his slave Lucky
 vah swany ko ucch koti kaa jameendaar maanata he jab ki vah keval ek ghamandi va swaarthee vyakti he jo dusron se asabhy vyavhaar karata he
 His pipe is made by Dublin's most famous tobacco company, Cap & Peterson
 Pozo called his pipe "briar", while Estragon showed him the "dudin" and the social and economic differences between the two
 pojo apni smriti kuch kamjor maanata tha parantu aisa isliye tha kyonki vah swalin rahata tha
 In Beckett's words "pozo suffered from an insecure mindset
 isiilie vah har vishay main bad chadh kar vaad-vivaad karata tha or har kaary main bhi aisa hi vyavhaar karata tha
 Pozo controlled Lucky with a long rope and jerked the rope harder when Lucky was too slow
 lucky purnataya uske kabje main tha tathaa ek "vafaadaar kute kii tarah" uski naikari bajaata tha
 "he did not hesitate to carry a heavy burden on his back
 saare naatak main lucky sirf ek baar bolta he, vah bhi tab jab pojo use vladimir va estrogan ke liye sochane ko kahata he
 Pozo and Lucky have been together for sixty years and their relationship has deteriorated significantly during this period
 lucky sadaa pojo se budhimaan tha parantu aayu ke saath vah ghrinaa kaa paatr ban gaya
 His "thinking" is his intelligence and his inferior "dance" is a cruel sign of old age
 pojo ke krur vyavhaar ke baavjood lucky sadaa uskaa vafaadaar rahaa
 duusare bhaag main bhi jab pojo achaanak andhaa ho jaataa he, lucky uskaa saath nahin chodta or maardarshak banataa he
 Their relationship value is more than a rope joint just as DD and Gogo are connected through "godot's Fantasy"
 america nirdeshak alan shnider ko baket ne yahi kaha tha: " ek manorogi he or uskaa paatr abhinit karne ke liye abhinayta ko thodaa paagalpan kaa put nihit karnaa hoga
" "in the translation of the play 


 Beckett continued to try to incorporate all the French things and added all the English names and places to Lucky
 Beckett believed that the name Lucky had a strong connection to English
 " The characters mention only one boy
 pehle bhaag main ek sthaneey ladkaa vladimir ko aashwast karata he ki vah didi ko pehali baar dekh rahaa he or vah kal nahin aayaa tha
 He reveals that he grazes goats for Mr
 Godot
 yah bhi kahata he ki uskaa bhai jise godot khub peethta he, bhed charaata he
 However Godot provides food to both and also allows them to live in their pasture
 bhaag do main ladkaa vladimir ko aashwast karata he ki pichley din aane vaala vyakti vah nahin tha, yah uskaa pehla aagaman he
 When Vladimir asks him what Godot does, the boy says, "sir, nothing
" The boy also says that Godot probably has a white beard
 baton main ladke ke ek biimaar bhai kaa bhi zikr aata he parantu yah spasht nahin ho paata ki yah bhai bhaag ek vaala hi ladkaa he yaa koi anya
 There have been many debates over the identity of Godot
 "jab colin dakworth ne baket se sidhe poocha ki kya pojo hi godot he to baket ne uttar diya: 'nahin
 aisa prathit hota he parantu yah asaty he
 "' "jab roger blin ne poocha ki godot ke paatr kaa kya paryaay he to baket ne kaha ki iskaa udgam juuton ke liye french apshabd godillo, godase se hua he kyonki pairon kaa naatak main ahm sthaan he
 Beckett used to explain this mostly about Godot
 " "once Beckett told Peter Woodthorp that he now regrets having named the character Godot because many viewers have created many misconceptions by linking it to God or God
 "maine richardsan se kaha ki agar meraa aashay bhagwaan se hota to main god hi naam rakhata godot nahin
 isse richardsan bahut niraash hue
" lekin baket ne ek baar yah bhi mana, "yadi main kahoon main godot shabd ke arth se waakif nahin hoon to yah vivekahin baat lagati he
 i know very well that many people consider it as a form of 'god' or God
 magar yaad rahe ki maine yah naatak french main likhaa tha or yadi yah khyaal meri upchetana main kahin tha bhi to pratyaksh main kabhi nahin aayaa
 "it was a funny statement because Beckett had said many times that the subconscious write with mind and even go into a trance-like state
 baket ke anya kaaryon kii tarah is naatak main koi cycle nahin haparantu hay kennar ne apane niabandh "di cartisian sentor" main likhaa he ki baket ne ek baar godot ke vishay par kaha tha ki godot ek vayovruddh cyclist he tathaa ganja va sadaa tikne vaala vyakti he
 Also, he is often seen as an official in national and city competitions
 uskaa pehla naam agyaat he parantu upnaam godiu he jiskaa uccharan godot hi he
 Although the play is not about the track cycle race, Beckett was an admirer of the French cyclist Rajar Gadot and had waited for him outside at the Rubel's velodrome
 donon ladakon main se ek hi pitayee se bachaa najar aata he, "baket bhi majaak main kehete hai, estrogan kaa ek pair batch gaya
 " britain va ireland main godot shabd ke uccharan main pratham shabdaansh par jor diya jaataa he, / ˈɡɒdoʊ / ; jabaki uttari america main duusare shabdaansh par, / ɡəˈdoʊ / 
 baket haalanki england vaale uccharan ko sahi maanate the
 It is silent
 ireland main janme paley baket ko irish bhashaa kaa acha gyaan tha
 In Irish Gaulik, "go dio" has two meanings "forever" and "for a long time"
 While writing, Beckett probably used the term from a somewhat sarcastic angle because he knew that English and French audiences would hardly understand those jargon
 donon krity main keval ek hi drishy he
 Two men are waiting near a tree on a native road
 purush anirdisht mul ke hai, haalanki yah spasht he ki rashtriyata kii drushti se ve angrej nahin he 
 script ke anusaar estrogan ek nichle tile par baithta he lekin vyaavhaarik drushti se - baket ke 1975 kii german film kii tarah - aam taur par yah ek pathar he
 The tree in the first digit is empty
 duusare ank main, kuch pattey dikhaai dete hai jabaki script ke anusaar yah aglaa din he
 Very few details are available to the mind "the idea of liu Vel which is a place which should not be given a detailed description"
 ek baar alan shnider ne naatak ko ek chakkar main daalane kaa suzav diya tha - pojo ko aksar ek ringamaster ke rup main ullikhit kiya gaya he - lekin baket ne unke vipareet paraamarsh diya: "apni anbhigyata kii drushti se main is chakra vaali baat se sahamat nahin hoon or mujhe lagata he ki godot ko ek bahut hi band bakse kii jarurat he
 "he also once expected the" foggy shadow of the stage floor bars "but eventually decided against this" disclosure "
 apane 1975 ke shiller theatre production main kuch had tak james nolsan ke vivaran main " jaal kii rassiyon main fansi hui pakshiyon kii tarah" didi or gogo kai baar uchhaalate hue dikhaai dete hai
 DD and Gogo are trapped only because they still cling to the concept that freedom is possible; Freedom is a state of mind like imprisonment
 baket ke anusaar is naatak kii prerana kaa ek strot casper david fredrick kii ek painting thi
 Ruby Cohan is lost in memories by seeing an 1824 painting with Beckett titled Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon, who "explicitly proclaims, 'you know, this was the source of Waiting for Godot
' '""ho saktaa he ki ve do paintingon ko lekar uljhan main pad gaye hon kyonki duusare maukon par unhone doston kaa dhyaan 1819 ke tu main contemplatting da moon kii taraf aakarshith kiya jisamen labaadaa pahane do purush ek sampoorn chaand ko dekh rahe the jo ek bade or bina pattiyon vaale ped kii kaali shakhaon se ghira hua tha
 "in both cases the painting was substantially the same, so their evaluation may apply equally to both
 haalanki kuch strot rucilon main sujen deschevox-dumesnil or baket ke bich hui baatcheet ko is kaary kii prerana maanate hai
 Beckett admitted this in a New York Post interview taken by Jerry Tallmer
 rubi kohan baket ke naatak lekhan kaa varnan "kaalpanik trayee ke uttarottar nirankush aantarikta ke ek palaayan" ke rup main karti hai - jiske liye vah baket ke moloy, melone dies or da ananameble kaa sandarbh prastut karti hai; baket ne daawa kiya he ki unhone "godot ke lekhan kaa armbh us samay swayan dwaara likhe ja rahe bhayankar gadhy se dur jane ke liye ek vishram ke rup main kiya tha
 " "chunki yah itnaa nirvastr, itnaa moulik he ki yah har tarah kii saamaajik or raajnneetik or dharmik vyakhya ko aamantrit karata he," normand berling ne sharad ritu 1999 ke ek naatak kii ek shradhanjali main likhaa tha, "jiske saath khud baket ko vibhinn sampradaayon ke vichaaron, vibhinn aandolanon or vichaarwaadon se joda gaya tha
 Attempts to explain him clearly have not been successful, but the desire to do so is natural when he encounters a writer whose minimalist art reaches a basic reality
 'kam' hamen 'adhik' kii talash karne ke liye majaboor karata he or godot or baket ke bare main baat karne kii jarurat ke parinamswaroop kitabon or lekhon kaa boj lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 " puure vatting for godot main pathak yaa darshak kaa saamana dharmik, darshanik, paaramparik, manovishleshnatmak or jivan sambandhi - khaas taur par yuddh ke samay ke - sandarbhon se ho saktaa he
 There are certain ritual aspects and elements that are directly derived from vaudeville and there is danger in making them more than they are: namely the mere structural features, the avatars in which the author establishes his fictional characters
 naatak main "kai theth roopon or paristhitiyon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he jinamein se sabhi apane aapako hasya or karuna donon main samahit karte hai
 "beckett makes this fact well evident in the opening notes of the film:" The above fact has nothing to do with any truth that has only been named a structural and dramatic feature
 " unhone yah kehete hue laurence harvey par ek or mahatvapurn tippanee kii ki "unka kaam anubhav par nirbhar nahin karata he - anubhav kaa record nahin he
 Of course you use it "
 baket "anant galatafahami" se turant thak gaye
 Long ago in 1955 he remarked that "I don't understand why people make a small thing so big
" " vah gupt suraagon se zyada kuch ummid nahin kar rahe the, haalaanki: "peter woodthrope ne ek din taxi main unase poocha ki naatak kis bare main tha: "yah sahjivita he, peter; yah sahjivita he,' baket ne jawaab diya
" Beckett directed the play for the Schiller Theater in 1975
 haalanki unhone kai prastutiyon kii dekharekh kii thi lekin aisa pehali hua tha ki is baar unhen sampoorn niyantran praapt hua tha
 Walter Asmus was his honest young assistant director
 yah production yaa prastuti prakritik nahin tha
 Beckett explained, yah ek khel he, sab kuch ek khel he
 When all four of them are on the ground, then it cannot be handled naturally
 He has to do it artificially, like a ballet
 nahin to sabakuch ek nakal, vaastaviktaa kii ek nakal ban jaati he 
 ise spasht or paardarshee hona chahie, na ki sookhaa
 yah jivit rahane ke liye khelaa jane vaala ek khel he
 " pichley kai saalon main baket ne spasht rup se yah mahasoos kiya ki kaaphi had tak godot kii kamyaabi is baat se sambandhit thi ki yah tarah-tarah ke pathan ke liye khulaa tha or yah anivaary rup se koi buree cheez nahin thi
 Beckett himself approved "one of Gadot's most famous mixed-race productions performed at the University of Cape Town's Baxter Theater, directed by Donald Howarth in which two black actors John Kani and Winston Natshona produced D
D
 Gogo played; Pojo and Lucky were played by two blond actors Bill Flynn and Peter Piccolo
 Redaction is often depicted as an explicit political presentation when in fact it was less heavily emphasized
 haalaanki aisi pratikriya dikhaai gai thi ki naatak ko kisi bhi tarah se ek raajnneetik roopak ke rup main nahin liya ja saktaa lekin phir bhi usamen kuch aise tatv hai jo kisi bhi sthaneey sthiti ke liye praasangik he jisamen ek vyakti ko duusare vyakti dwaara shoshit yaa pratadit kiya ja rahaa he
 " "ise sheet yuddh ke ek roopak ke rup main dekha gaya tha" yaa germanon ke prati francisi pratirodh ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 Customer Hasell writes that, "it seems that Pozo and Lucky's accession is nothing more than a metaphor for Ireland's view of Mainland Britain where society is still cursed by a greedy ruling elite while the working class is left passive and everything Is unaware of " Like the Beckett on Film project, the pair are often featured with an Irish accent
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki yah baket kii lay or shabd rachana kaa ek anivaary parinaam he lekin ise paath main nirdisht nahin kiya gaya he
 By no means are they part of the English repository: at one point in the play Estragon makes fun of the English pronunciation of the word "calm" and enjoys the "story of the Englishman in the brothel"
 "barnard deukor didi, gogo and da absent godot main ek trayee siddhant ko viksit karte hai jo sigmund frid ke da igo and da id main trimurti maanas vivaran or onomastic takanic ke upyog par aadhaarit he
 Ducor defines characters based on the absence of "rational go-go embodies the incomplete ego, the principle of missing happiness: go-go
 D-d - which is of a more natural nature and irrational - than the rational principle Backward is seen as ID or sabotage
 godot maha-ahankaar yaa naitik maanakon ke kaary ko puraa karata he
 Pozo and Lucky are mere repetitions of the main characters
 deukor ant main baket kii naatak ko manushya ke astitv kii nirarthakta ke ek roopak ke rup main dekhtaa he jab ek bahari antity se mukti kii ummid kii jaati he or khud ke aatmanirikshan se nakaar diya jaataa he
 "the four aspects of the soul or the four typical personalities are classified into two pairs: the ego and the shadow, the personality and the image of the soul
 The shadow is the character that contains all our petty feelings under the ego
 lucky, chaaya nirankush pojo, samrudh saamanyata kaa prototip, ke dhruviya vilom ke rup main kaary karata he jo uttarottar apane adhinsth ko niyantrit or tang karata he, is prakaar yah nirankush ahankaar se achet chaaya ke utpeedan kaa pratik he
 Lucky's monologue in the first issue appears as an example of a stream of repressed unconsciousness as he is allowed to "think" for his master
 sugandhit jadibuti taragon ke alaava estrogan ke naam kaa ek or matlab he: "estrogan" mahila hormone estrogen kaa ek sajaateey he

 It tells of Estragon's poetic instincts, his sensibilities and dreams, his irrational moods
 vladimir poorak maradaana siddhant kii tarah yaa shaayad tarksangat vyaktitv ke manansheel prakaar ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 It is widely said that existentialists think that there are some fundamental questions that every human being faces if they take their subjective existence seriously
 un sawaalon main mrityu, maanav astitv kaa arth or us astitv main ishwar kaa sthaan jaise sawaal shaamil hai
 To a large extent the principles of existentialism emphasize that conscious reality is too complex and lacks any "objective" or universally known value: by accepting and leaving it to the individual, not just about it By talking or imagining it in mind, value should be created
 Here this drama can be seen touching all these issues
 godot sahit baket kii zyaadaatar rachanaaon ko darshanik or saahitiyik vidwaan theatre of da absard ke andolan kaa hissaa maanate hai jo theatre kaa ek aisa rup he jisaki utpatti albert kaamu ke nirarthakwaadi darshan se hui thi
 Futileism itself is a branch of traditional assertions of existentialism, whose precursor was Søren Kierkegaard, and who believes that mankind is incapable of detecting it because of some form of mental or philosophical limitation, despite the existence of meaning well contained in the universe
 is
 is prakaar maanavtaa da absard yaa aatanrik uddeshy ke abhaav main astitv kii param nirarthakta kaa saamana karne ke liye abhishpt he
 Right after DD and Gogo are particularly selfish and rude the boy comes to tell that Godot is not coming
 ladke ko namrata or aashaa kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue dekha ja saktaa he jiske baad ek ubharate vyaktitv or charitra dwaara jaanboojhkar dayaa ke bhav kaa tyaag kar diya jaataa he or is maamle main yuva pojo or lucky shaamil ho sakate hai
 Godot thus has a sense of pity and fails to reach his promise every day
 kisi ko is baat kii parvaah nahin he ki ek ladke ko peeta gaya he
 The irony in this interpretation is that only by making their hearts compassionate can the characters waiting near the tree move forward and stop waiting for Godot
 baket kii luk 23:39–43 kii do choron kii kahani ke samavesh main bahut kuch padhane ko mil saktaa he or uske baad pachhataave par charchaa kii ja sakati he
 It is easy to see the solitude tree as a representative of the Christian cross or indeed as a tree of life
 isi tarah, chunki ladkaa ishwar kaa varnan ek safed dadhi vaale ishwar ke rup main karata he or agar ladke ke pramaan par vishwaas kiya jaae to godot kii dadhi bhi safed he jisase kai log ishwar or godot ko ek rup main dekhte hai or ek samaan samajhate hai
 Vladimir's "christ has shown kindness to us!" Can be considered as proof that it is at least what he believes
 yah sab padhane se pehle ank ke aarambhik drishyon ko adhik bal miltaa he jab estrogan vladimir se poochta he ki usne godot se kya anurodh kiya he: Vladimir: Oh 


 nothing special
 estrogan: koi prarthana
 Vladimir: To some extent
 estrogan: ek aspasht vinati
 Vladimir: Perfect
 naatak ke adhikansh hisse kaa sambandh dharm ke vishay se he jo kaaphi had tak likhit sanket se otprot he
 The entire drama takes place atop a hill which some people may call heaven, which serves the purpose of being a religious parable
 anthoni chronin ke anusaar, " ke paas hameshaa ek bible hota tha, naatak ke ant main uske paas ek se adhik sanskaran the or bible kii shabdanukramanika hameshaa uski aalmaari main rakhe sandarbh pustakon main hote the
 "beckett himself had an open view on this issue:" Christianity is a mythology that i am fully familiar with, so i naturally use it
 "as Cronin points out, his biblical references are" satirical or even That can also be sarcastic "
 "1937 main bachaav paksh ke vakil dwaara puche gaye sawaal ki ve isai the yaa yahudee yaa naastik, ke jawaab main baket ne kaha, 'teenon main se koi nahin'"

 As a result he is dismissed, satirized or ignored, but he and his battered son are certainly never removed
 ek pratikatmak str par, ham do paatro estrogan or vladimir ko naatak main ullikhit do choron ke rup main dekh sakate hai
 Estragon is punished for some unknown reason which may mean that he is the thief who is scorned to curse Christ
 duusari ore, vladimir vah chor ho saktaa he jo ninda se batch niklaa he haalaanki yah keval bhautik he
 This retaliation reveals the arbitrary God represented by Beckett
 vatting for godot kaa varnan "russilon main lambii paidal yatra ke roopak ke rup main kiya gaya he jab baket or sujen din ke samay ghaas ke dher main so gaye the or jois ke liye baket ke rishte kaa lihaaj rakhane ke liye raat hone tak chalate rahe
" aarambhik masaude main mahatvapurn vyaktigat sandarbh shaamil hai lekin unhen baad main nikaal diya gaya
 Since the play finds reference to only male actors, because it rarely contains references to women, some people regard the relationship between Vladimir and Estragon as semi-rights: "they quarrel, they embrace each other, they embrace each other They can be considered a married couple
 " pehle ank main estrogan apane saathi ke paas dhire se jaakar uske kandhe par haath rakhkar us ke saath dhire-dhire baat karata he
 After asking for his hand in return and advising him not to stubbornly, he suddenly hugs her but retreats with the same swiftness complaining that "you smell garlic!" jab estrogan bible main uski samayik drishyon kii yaad dilaataa he or yaad karata he ki mrit sagar yaa ded si ke maanchitron ke rang kitne sundar the to vah tippanee karata he ki "ham vahiin jaaenge, main hameshaa yahi kaha karata tha ki ham apane honeymoon ke liye vahiin jaaenge
 ham tirenge
 hamen majaa aayega
" iske alaava, bina mahilaon vaale vishwa ke sandarbh main postmortem irection paane kaa laalach paidaa hota he
 Estragon in particular is "much more excited" than Vladimir, who chooses to talk about the ostentatious occasion
 apane saathi kii uttejan ke prati uski spasht udaseenta ko ek prakaar ke chanchal chhedhkhani ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Another possible example of synergism can be seen in the section in which Estragon "sucks" its ends, although Beckett describes it as an action
 baket apane kaary ke liye sabase arthpurna drushtikon ke liye khulaa nahin tha
 She is aware of this objection when several women's acting companies started staging the play in the 1980s
 ""mahilaon ke paas prostate nahin he," baket ne kaha, jo is baat kaa ek sandarbh thi ki vladimir ko peshaab karne ke liye baar-baar manch chhodkar janaa padataa tha
 In 1988, Beckett resorted to a Dutch theater company called de Harlemsay Tönlicheur to prosecute the issue
 "baket apana mukadmaa haar gaya
 But the issue of gender seemed so important to him that it became a distinction for a playwright to which he reacted so angrily that the publication of all his plays in the Netherlands was banned
 " 1991 main, tathaapi, "jaj huguate le foyer de ne faisla sunaaya ki prakaashan kii vajah se baket kii viraasat kii atyadhik kshati nahin hogi" or pratishthit aviganan samaaroh main brut de beton ke sabhi mahila kalaakon dwaara is naatak kaa vidhivat pradarshan kiya gaya
 In 2006, the Italian Pontadera Theater Foundation won a similar case when it presented two actresses in the roles of Vladimir and Estragon, although the traditional roles of the letters were male
 1995 ke acco samaaroh main diarector nola chilton ne lucky kii bhoomika main daniela misheli ke saath ek prastuti kaa manchan kiya or 2001main indiana vishvavidhyalay kii ek prastuti main pojo or ladke kii bhoomika ke liye mahilaon ko prastut kiya gaya
 "on 17 February 1952 


 an abbreviated version of the play was performed and broadcast on the radio in a studio called Club d'isai de la Radio 


 Although he sent a polite note that Roger Blinn read, but Beckett himself did not get it
 " a part of his preface stated that: minuit sanskaran 17 oktober 1952 main mudrit rup main naatak ke pehle purna naatakeey pradarshan se pehle dikhaai diya

 Initial public performances, however, were not event-less: the curtain fell after "lucky's monologue" during a performance as twenty dressed but disgruntled spectators began to sarcastically play the city

 The entire presentation was completed on a very low budget; Martin's big and torn bag as an example "the theater dresser's husband was found in the city's garbage while he was cleaning the trash cans

 In the 1950s Beckett's amazement led to a strict ban on theater in the UK as he considered it a supporter of free speech
 lord chemberlen ne is baat par jor diya ki "irection" shabd ko hataa diya jaae, "'fartove' 'popov' ban gaya or shrimati gozo ko 'clap' ke bajaay 'varts' mila
