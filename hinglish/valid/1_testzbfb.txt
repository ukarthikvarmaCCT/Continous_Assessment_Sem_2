newton ko shanti kaa nyaayadhish banaaya gaya or june 1698 or christmas 1699 ke bich unhone gavaah, mukhabiron or sandigdhon ke 200 parikshan karwaae
 Newton won his commitment and in February 1699 he had ten prisoners awaiting release
 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it
 usne sansad main arji di ki sikkon kii dhalaai ke liye uski yojana ko sweekaar kar liya jaye taaki jaalsaji na kii ja sake, jabaki usee samay jaali sikke saamne aaye
 Newton tested cheating on Chaloner and in September 1697 sent him to New Gate Prison
 lekin chalonor ke ucch sthanon par mitra the, jinhone use uski rihaai ke liye madad kii
 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence
 chaloner ko ucch rajdroh kaa doshi paaya gaya tha or use 23 march 1699 ko tiburn gelos main faansee de kar dafna diya gaya
 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he

 rasul hamaare liye kai myanon main mahatvapurn hai
 There is hardly any other contemporary folk artists of Rasul who have stirred up the people against the then British power and have gone to the camp of soldiers and said- chhod da goraki ke ab tu khushaami baalama Aakar Kahiya takes a tax, Slavery Balma deshva hamaar banal i aa ke rani Please take control over me ekar chhod da tu dihal, salaami baalama Aakar Kahiya le Karb, Slavery Balma

 In 1951, they beat Blackpool 2–1, a year later, beating Arsenal 1–0 and in 1955 they beat Manchester City 3–1
 Newcastle had now gained a higher rating and so did its players; Notably 'war Jackie' Milburn and Bobby 'dazzler' Mitchell
 Other players on this team were Frank Brennan, Ivor Broudice, Len White, and Welshman Ivor Elchurch

 abul mujaffar muhiuddeen mohammad aurangzeb alamgir jise aamtaur par aurangzeb yaa alamgir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha bharat par rajya karne vaala chatha mogul shaasha tha
 His reign lasted from 1658 until his death in 1707
 aurangzeb ne bhartiya upmahadweep par aadhi sadi se bhi zyada samay tak rajya kiya
 He was the longest reigning Mughal ruler after Akbar
 apane jeevankaal main usne dakshini bharat main mogul samrajya kaa vistaar karne kaa bharsak prayaas kiya par uski mrityu ke pashchaat mogul samrajya sikudne laga
 The Mughal Empire reached the climax of its expansion under Aurangzeb's rule
 wo apane samay kaa shaayad sabase dhani or shaatishalee vyakti tha jisane apane jeevankaal main dakshin bharat main praapt vijayon ke jariye mogul samrajya ko saadhe baarah lakh varg mile main failaayaa or 15 karod logon par shashan kiya jo kii duniya kii aabaadi kaa 1 / 4 tha
 Aurangzeb imposed fatwa-e-alamgiri on the entire empire and also imposed an additional tax on non-muslims for some time
 gair-musalmaan janata par shariat lagu karne vaala wo pehla musalmaan shaasha tha
 During his reign, the Mughals had the highest number of Hindus among their court
 or sikhon ke guru teg bahadur ko darashikoh ke saath milakar baghaavat ke jurm main mrityudand diya gaya tha
 Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618 in Dahod, Gujarat
 wo shahjahan or mumtaz mahal kii chhathi santan or teesraa betaa tha
 His father was the Subedar of Gujarat at that time
 june 1626 main jab uske pita dwaara kiya gaya vidroh asafal ho gaya to aurangzeb or uske bhai daara shukoh ko unke dada jahangir ke lahore vaale darbar main nur jahaan dwaara bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya
 Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents in Agra Fort on 26 February 1628 when Shah Jahan was proclaimed the Mughal Emperor
 yaheen par aurangzeb ne arabi or farsi kii aupchaarik shiksha praapt kii
 According to Mughal practices, Shah Jahan appointed Shahzada Aurangzeb as the Subedar of the Deccan in 1634
 aurangzeb kirki ko gaya jiskaa naam badalakar usne aurangabad kar diya
 In 1637 she married Rabia Durrani
 idhar shahjahan mogul darbar kaa kaamkaaj apane bete daara shikoh ko saunpane laga
 Aurangzeb's sister died in an accident in 1644
 aurangzeb is ghatana ke teen hafte baad agra aayaa jisase uske pita shahjahan ko usapar behad krodh aayaa
 He dismissed Aurangzeb from the rank of Subedar of Deccan
 aurangzeb 7 maheenon tak darbar nahin aa sakaa
 Later Shah Jahan made him the Subedar of Gujarat
 aurangzeb ne sucharu rup se shashan kiya or use iskaa sila bhi mila, use badakhshaan or balkh kshetra kaa soobedaar bana diya gaya
 After this he was also made governor of Multan and Sindh
 is dauraan wo faras ke safaviyon se qandahar par niyantran ke liye ladata rahaa par use haar ke alaava or kuch mila to wo tha- apane pita kii upeksha
 In 1652 he was rebuilt the Subedar of the Deccan
 usne golconda or bijapur ke khilaaf ladaaiyaan kii or nirnaayak kshan par shahjahan ne sena waapas bula lee
 This greatly hurt Aurangzeb as Shah Jahan was doing this at the behest of his brother Dara Shikoh
 san 1652 main shahjahan biimaar padaa or aisa lagane laga ki shahjahan kii maut aa jaaegi
 The power struggle started in Dara Shukoh, Shah Suja and Aurangzeb
 shah suza, jisane apane ko bengal kaa governor ghoshit karavaaya tha ko harkar burma ke arakaan kshetra janaa padaa or 1659 main aurangzeb ne shahjahan ko tajmahal main shahi khajaane ko karch karne ke zurm main najarband karne ke baad apane ko badshaah ghoshit karavaaya
 Dara Shikoh was hanged for treason
 aurangzeb ne kabhi bhi shahi khajaane ko swayan par karch nahin kiya
 The Mughals, especially since Akbar, had been lenient on non-muslims, but Aurangzeb was just the opposite
 aurangzeb ne jazia kar phir se aarambh karavaaya, jise akbar ne khatm kar diya tha
 He forced the Kashmiri Brahmins to accept Islam
 kashmiri brahmanon ne sikhon ke nauven guru teg bahadur se madad maangi
 When Tegh Bahadur opposed this, Aurangzeb hanged him
 is din ko sikh aaj bhi apane tyohaaron main yaad karte hai
 During the reign of Aurangzeb, there was a wave of war-rebellion-repression-climbing etc
 pashchim main sikhon kii sankhya or shakti main badhottaree ho rahi thi
 He eventually defeated Bijapur and Golconda in the south, but in the meantime Shivaji's Maratha army plagued him
 shivaji ko aurangzeb ne giraftaar kar to liya par shivaji or sambhaaji ke bhaag nikalne par uske liye behad fikr kaa sabab ban gaya
 After all, Shivaji Maharaja defeated Aurangzeb and Marathas in India increased their strength throughout the country even after Shivaji's death the Marathas harassed Aurangzeb
 is bich hinduon ko islam main parivartit karne kii niti ke kaaran rajput uske kilaaf ho gaye the or uske 1707 main marane ke turant baad unhone vidroh kar diya
 Aurangzeb's administration had more Hindus than other Mughal emperors and Shivaji was also involved
 mughal itihaas ke bare main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki duusare baadshahon kii tulana main aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sabase zyada hindu prashasan kaa hissaa the
 Historical facts show that during the reign of Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, Hindus constituted 24 per cent of the various posts in the army, other important posts in the court and various geographical administrative units, which rose to 33 per cent during Aurangzeb's time
 em athar ali ke shabdon main kahen to yah tathy is dharna ke virodh main sabase tagada saboot he ki badshaah hindu manasabadaaron ke saath pakshpaat karata tha
 a large number of Rajputs were appointed to senior positions in Aurangzeb's army
 maratha or sikhon ke khilaaf aurangzeb ke hamale ko dharmik chashme se dekha jaataa he lekin yah nishkarsh nikaalte vakt is baat kii upeksha kar di jaati he ki tab yuddh kshetra main mughal sena kii kaman aksar rajput senapati ke haath main hoti thi
 Historian Yadunath Sarkar writes that at one time Shivaji himself was a mansabdar in Aurangzeb's army
 kaha jaataa he ki ve dakshin bharat main mughal sultanate ke pramukh banaae jane vaale the lekin unki sainya kushalta ko bhaanpane main naakaam rahe aurangzeb ne is niyukti ko manjuuri nahin di
 Aurangzeb lived a holy life
 apane vyaktigat jivan main vah ek adarsh vyakti tha
 He was completely free from all the enemies that were common among the kings of Asia
 vah yeti-jivan jeeta tha
 He was restrained in eating, drinking, dressing and all other amenities of life
 prashasan ke baari kaam main vyast rahete hue bhi vah apni jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye quran kii nakal karke or tapiyaan sikar kuch paisa kamaane kaa samay nikaal letaa tha
 Not only Aurangzeb, one thing is said about all the Muslim kings of medieval India that none of them were Indians
 vaise ek str par yah bachakaana or bematlab kaa tark he kyonki 17veen shatabdi ke bharat main raashtra jaisi avadharana kaa to kahin astitv hi nahin tha
 Even after this, however, this thing does not apply at least in the case of Aurangzeb
 yah mughal badshaah pakkaa ucchwargeey hindustani tha
 Its simple logic is that he was born in Dahod, Gujarat and was raised like children of upper-class Indian families
 puure mughalkaal main braj bhashaa or uske sahitya ko hameshaa sangrakshan mila tha or yah parampara aurangzeb ke shashan main bhi jari rahi
 Columbia University historian Alison Bush says that there was an atmosphere of encouragement to Braj in Aurangzeb's court
 badshaah ke bete ajam shah kii braj kavita main khaasi dilchaspee thi
 He patronized some big names of Braj literature such as Mahakavi Dev
 isi bhashaa ke ek or bade kavi vrund to aurangzeb ke prashasan main bhi niyukt the
 The official writing language of the court during the Mughal period was Persian, but before the rule of Aurangzeb, the language prevailing between the emperors and the courtiers had become hindi-urdu
 ise aurangzeb ke us patr se bhi samajha ja saktaa he jo usne apane 47 varshiya bete ajam shah ko likhaa tha
 The emperor had presented a fort to his son and ordered to be sung on the occasion
 ajam shah ko likhe patr main aurangzeb ne likhaa he ki jab vah baccha tha to use nagaadon kii aawaaj khub pasand thi or vah aksar kahata tha, ‘babaaji dhan-dhan!’ is udhaaharan se yah baat kahi ja sakati he ki aurangzeb kaa betaa tatkaaleen prachlit hindi main hi apane pita se baatcheet karata tha
 Emperor Aurangzeb acknowledged the importance of the religion of Islam, making the 'quran' the basis of his rule
 usne sikkon par kalma khudwana, nauroj kaa tyohaar manaanaa, bhaang kii kheti karnaa, gaanaa-bajaanaa aadi par roak laga di
 Banned the practice of sati in 1663 AD
 tirth kar punah lagaaya
 In 11 years of his rule, 'jharokha Darshan', in the 12th year, banned 'tuladan system', banned Hindu festivals in 1668 AD
 1699 i
 main usne hindu mandiron ko todane kaa aadesh diya
 'muhtasib' was appointed by Aurangzeb in large cities
 1669 i
 main aurangzeb ne banaras ke ‘vishwanath mandir’ evam mathura ke ‘keshav raay madingr’ ko tudwa diya
 He abolished about 80 taxes levied against the Sharia
 inhen main ‘aabwab’ naam se janaa jane vaala ‘raaydaari’ or ‘pandari’ naamak sthaneey kar bhi shaamil the
 Aurangzeb considered converting 'darul Herb' to 'darul Islam' as his important goal
 aurangzeb ke samay main braj main aane vaale tirth−yatriyon par baari kar lagaaya gaya jazia kar phir se lagaaya gaya or hinduon ko musalmaan banaaya gaya
 Aurangzeb's atrocities are mentioned in the compositions of poets of that time
 aurangzeb dwaara lagaaya gaya jajia kar us samay ke hisaab se tha
 Akbar abolished the Jaziya tax, but it was re-enacted during Aurangzeb
 jajia saamaanya karon se alag tha jo gaiyr muslimon ko chukaana padataa tha
 It had three levels and it was determined by the income of the person concerned
 is kar ke kuch apwaad bhi the
 The poor, unemployed and physically challenged people did not come under its purview
 inke alaava hinduon kii varna vyavastha main sabase upar aane vaale brahman or sarkari adhikari bhi isse baahar the
 Such was the religious tax zakat imposed on Muslims, which was necessary for every rich Muslim
 aadhunik mulyon ke mandandon par jajia nischitarup se ek pakshpaati kar vyavastha thi
 Modern nations cannot make such a distinction on the basis of religion and caste
 isiilie jab ham 17veen shatabdi kii vyavastha ko aadhunik rashtron ke paimaane par ise dekhte hai to yah bahut arajak vyavastha lag sakati he, lekin aurangzeb ke samay aisa nahin tha
 Other examples are also found in that period
 jaise maraathon ne dakshin ke ek bade hisse se mughalon ko bedakhal kar diya tha
 Their tax system was also biased at about the same level
 ve musalamaanon se jakaat vasuulate the or hindu aabaadi is tarah kii kisi bhi kar vyavastha se baahar thi
 Aurangzeb had built more temples than he had broken
 vishwaprasiddh itihaaskaar richard iton ke mutabik mughalkaal main mandiron ko dhahaana durlabh ghatana hua karti thi or jab bhi aisa hua to uske kaaran raajnneetik rahe
 According to Eaton, the same temples were demolished in which the rebels were given shelter or with the help of which a conspiracy was made against the emperor
 us samay mandir todane kaa koi dharmik uddeshy nahin tha
 Aurangzeb, notorious in this case, also followed the same rule of the Sultanate
 uske shasankaal main mandir dhahaane ke udhaaharan bahut hi durlabh hai or jo hai unki jad main raajnneetik kaaran hi rahe hai
 Aurangzeb, for example, never targeted temples in South India, while most of the army was stationed here during his reign
 uttar bharat main usne jarur kuch mandiron par hamale kiye jaise mathura kaa keshav raay mandir lekin iskaa kaaran dharmik nahin tha
 The Jats of Mathura revolted against the Sultanate, hence the attack
 thik iske ulat kaarnon se aurangzeb ne mandiron ko sangrakshan bhi diya
 This was his offering to Hindus who were loyal to the emperor
 kings college, landan kii itihaaskaar catherine butler to yahaan tak kahati hai ki aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tode, usase zyada banawaye the
 Scholars like Catherine Frank, m Athar Ali and Jalaluddin also point out that Aurangzeb had given grants to several Hindu temples, including the movable Bari Math in Banaras, Balaji Temple in Chitrakoot, Someshwar Nath Mahadev Temple in Allahabad and Umananda Temple in Guwahati
 Famous names are
 jis kalkhand yani mughalkaal main mandiron ko tode jane kii baat itani zyada prachlan main he, usamen hinduon dwaara kahin is baat kaa vishesh zikr nahin miltaa
 It can be argued that doing so in those times would not have been empty of danger, but even when the Sultanate came to an end in the 18th century, there is no mention of this
 ateet main mughal shaskaon dwaara hindu mandir tode jane kaa mudda bharat main 1980-90 ke dashak main garm hua 
 a big argument is also made in trying to prove Aurangzeb as fanatical that he had banned music, but this is also not true
 catherine bataati hai ki sultanate main to kya sangeet par uske darbar main bhi pratibandh nahin tha
 On the day the emperor took over the throne, every year there was a lot of dancing and singing in the festival
 kuch dhrupadon kii rachana main aurangzeb naam shaamil he jo bataata he ki uske shasankaal main sangeet ko sangrakshan hasil tha
 Some historical facts also point to the fact that he himself was well versed in music
 mirat-e-alam main bakhtawar khan ne likhaa he ki badshaah ko sangeet visharadon jaisaa gyaan tha
 Mughal scholar Fakirullah has recorded the names of Aurangzeb's favorite singers and instrumentalists in a document titled Raag Darpan
 aurangzeb ko apane beton main ajam shah bahut priy tha or itihaas bataata he ki shah apane pita ke jeevankaal main hi nipun sangeetkaar ban chukaa tha
 Talking about music flourishing during Aurangzeb's reign, Catherine writes, 'the highest commentary on music was written in Persian during the time of Aurangzeb, compared to the entire Mughal period of 500 years
 ’ haalanki yah baat sahi he ki apane jivan ke antim samay main aurangzeb zyada dharmik ho gaya tha or usne geet-sangeet se duuri bana lee thi
 But looking at the things we have mentioned above, it can be assumed that he never made his personal wish the official policy of the Sultanate
 aurangzeb ke antim samay main dakshin main maraathon kaa jor bahut bad gaya tha
 The imperial army was not getting success in suppressing them
 isliye san 1683 main aurangzeb swayan sena lekar dakshin gaya
 He stayed away from the capital, in the same campaign for the last 25 years of his reign
 50 varsh tak shashan karne ke baad uski mrityu dakshin ke ahmednagar main 3 march san 1707 i
 main ho gai
 He was buried in the compound of the tomb of Fakir Buruhanuddin in Daulatabad
 uski niti ne itane virdohi paidaa kar diye, jis kaaran mogul samrajya kaa ant hi ho gaya

 The film is directed by Milan Luthria and co-produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor
 ekta kapur ko jab is film kaa khyal aayaa tab unhone kathanak-kar rajat aroda ko kahani likhane ko kaha
 The Dirty Picture was released worldwide on 2 December 2011 in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages
 vidya baalan, nasiruddin shah or imran hashmi ne film main mukhya kirdaaron kii bhumika nibhaai he
 The film was well received by critics after its release and was a commercial success
 film kii shuruyaat reshma ke shaadi ke ek din pehle ghar chod kar chennai bhaagane se hoti he
 She tries hard to get a character in a film, but the director of the film disrespects her by calling her useless and unattractive
 reshma punh drudh nishchay se use manaane jaati or aakhir car ek said dancer kaa kirdaar hasil kar leti he
 As soon as the shooting starts, she immediately starts dancing with a whip on the main screen with vulgar and provocative expressions
 uski is harakat se film nirdeshak abraham yah soch kar gussa ho jaataa he ki uski film banane kii kala parde par dikhni chahie na kii uttejnapurna or ashleel saamagree
 He cuts the entire portion of Reshma's dance from the film
 film box offis par pit jaati he jisase nirmaataa selva ganesh kaafii naaraaz ho jaataa he or reshma ko baad main milakar use apni aagaamee film main ek gaanaa de detaa or use suzav detaa he ki abse vah apana naam silk rakh le
 In her first scene, Silk is mesmerized by seeing Suryakant and gets embarrassed, which makes the first scene useless and Suryakant gets angry
 silk use apni ore aakarshith karke manaa leti he or lambey samay tak aniatik sambandh banaae rakhane kaa vaada karti he
 On the other hand, Abraham suggests a new film, Selva Ganesh, and wishes to cast Suryakant in the lead role
 sooryakanth abraham ko film main masala or sex daalane ko kahata he taaki film acha vyavsaay kar sake
 This makes Abraham more angry and hates Silk
 duusari ore silk ko is baat par vishwaas he ki filmein manoranjan ke liye hoti he or vah apana kaam jarirakhti he
 She works with Suryakant in a number of provocative films and through her dancing has become very popular in the male section and has become a famous and immortal South Indian sex actress
 sooryakanth kaa chota bhai or benaam lekhak ramakant khulaasa karata he ki vah silk kaa prashansak he or usase dosti karne kii koshish karata he
 Silk is happy that someone likes him, not his body
 ve donon silk ke puraane ghar jate he jahaan silk kii maan hameshaa ke liye usase saare rishte tod leti he
 In an award ceremony, Silk is rewarded for his work, but Suryakant defames him by calling him the 'dirty secret' of others
 silk ghoshnaa karti he ki vah apni 'darty pikchar' bananaa jari rakhegi or use isamen koi shame nahin he
 Silk begins to spend more time with Ramakant who now falls in love with him
 vah use lekhak ke taur par ubharne ko kahati he or uske bade bhai ke film kareer kii chaaya se bahaar nikalne kii salaah detii he
 Taking this relationship as a good news, a journalist defames Naila Silk for having a relationship with the two brothers
 sooryakanth aakhirkaar silk ko apni filmon main se hataa detaa he jisase vah chote film nirmaaton ke saath kaam karne ke liye majaboor ho jaati he
 Unhappy and bored with this work, she loses her desire to work, due to which other producers start to discredit her
 baad main ramakant kii nai film kii launch party main silk ek ubhartee adaakara shakeela se milti he
 Jealous of her, she insults him and provokes him to dance
 nrity ke ant main silk jaanboojh kar shakeela ko gira detii he or yah dikhaati he ki use koi haraa nahin saktaa
 Embarrassed by this act of Silk, Ramakant breaks up with him
 silk kii jindagi bikharane lagati he
 Critics and women begin to discredit him
 vah sharaab or dhumrapaan kii lat kaa shikaar ho jaati he or vajan badhane lagata he
 The directors stop taking him in his films
 vah selva ganesh ke paas ek film banane aa aagrah karti he jo buree tarah pit jaati he jiske chalate vah apni daulat or shauharat donon ganvaa baithti he
 Along with this, Abraham also releases a film in which he himself plays the lead role and the film succeeds
 apni safalataa, silk kii naakamayaabi or donon ke bich baatcheet ke chalate abraham ko yahan ahsaas hota he ki vah silk se pyaar karne laga he
 Unable to stop himself from thinking about her, he goes to Silk's house where the two talk about Silk's life
 us vakt tak silk bahut bade karj tale dabi hoti he or majaboor hokar ek chote film nirmaataa ke paas kaam maangane jaati he jisase vah ramakant kii party main mili thi
 There, he is shocked that he wants to take her to a pornographic film and before he protests, he starts drunk by drinking him with alcohol
 jald hi us jagah par police chapa maar detii he par silk sabake saath batch nikalne main kaamyaab ho jaati he
 She somehow reaches her home where she feels ashamed of her image
 duusari ore abraham silk kii maan ko dhund nikaalata he or unhen lekar silk ko agali subah milaane kii sochataa he
 But the same night when he calls Silk from one of his party, Silk asks him to say goodbye to everyone on his behalf
 abraham ko shaq ho jaataa he or vah silk ke ghar kii ore daud padataa he jaha use silk laal rang kii sari main bhartiya mek-ap ke saath mari hui milti he
 Due to her failure, Silk commits suicide by eating sleeping pills
 ant main abraham or uski maan uskaa antim sanskaar karte he
 The whole story is narrated in the past by Abraham, who was the only person who could understand the pain of silk, his desires, his dreams, his hard work and the darkness behind him which was hidden behind his rise and fall

 He said that The Dirty Picture would be the answer to the Academy Award nominated film Boogie Nights from India
 baad main patrkaar sammelan main unhone spasht kiya ki raagini em em es or da darty pikchar koi porn film nahin he

" film ek bahut achche kathanak ke saath bani he or mere karyaalay main kain yuvaaon ne isaki kaaphi prashansa kii he

 "the story chose me! It was a thought of unity; he asked the author to write a story based on it and when it was done, he asked me to read it comfortably
 vah ek nae nirdeshak ke haathon film banvaanaa chaahati thi kyonki yah koi mahangi film nahin thi or naa hi unke paas itnaa bajet tha, par jab maine kahani padhi to main mantrmugdh rahaa gai
 i told him i wanted to make it; It was an exclusive material - no spice film and i did not ask that anyone else direct it
 " When screenwriter Rajat Aroda started writing the film, there was only a small budget film that focused mainly on the low-porn scenes of the 1980s, but as development progressed, Smita's biography was also fictionalized
 
 film ke liye shodhakarya karte hue milan lutheriya or rajat aroda ko us kaal kii magajeenon main behad kam lekh mili kyonki "silk smita jaisi auraten magajeenon main apni jagah nahin bana paati thi jab tak ve koi nai charchaa kaa vishay na bane"
 That is why he gathered information about his life from conversations, people he met at the party and his friends, which was later linked to Kalpana

 When Vidya Balan was told the script and was shown pictures of the clothes she would have to wear, including tight pants, big throats and petticoats, she had a lot of trouble

 ek ore jahaan aam taur par filmon main kitaab se saare chizon ko liya gaya he vahiin kitaab ke kuch pathakon kaa maananaa he ki film main kuch badlaav kiye gaye hai
 Many changes have been made to the characters of the film such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, even as the main protagonist Frodo, as well as many changes to the events when the book If we compare the film, then it is known that how different is its tone and subject from the book
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki upanyaas ke ant se pehle vaale adhyay "da scoring of da sheer" ko purna rup se mitaa diya gaya he, jise tolkin cathyparak rup se aavashyak maanate the
 Wayne G
 Hammond, who worked on Tolkien's works, has said about the first two films: pustak ke kuch prashansak is baat se asahmat he ki is tarah ke badlaav darshakon ke liye kiye gaye hai, prashansakon ko mul ke kareeb laane ke liye hi bahut saare parivartan kiye gaye hai
 a combined 8-hour triology version exists, called The Lord of the Rings: The Purist's Edition
 triology ke prashansakon ne daawa kiya he ki yah pustak kaa ek sahi vyakhya he or kiye gaye adhikanshtah parivartan aavashyak the
 Boynes, who co-authored the film, said that the people who worked on the triology are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee who actually met Tolkien in person, as well as once he said That is not the case, it is just an explanation of his book
 2005 main, mithopoic sosayadi ne is triology or iske lokapriy samskruti par prabhaav par mahatvapurn niabandh prakashit kii thi jiskaa sheershak tha tolkin on film:aisse on peter jaction da lord of da rings 
 is pustak kii kaaphi saraahna kii gai chunki ye kaaphi santulit thi or iske lekhak ko "sahi myne main mahatvapurn" mana gaya, kyonki ve "film kaise safal or asafal he, donon par vichaar rakhti he or saath hi uske lokapriyata kii prashansa or shok donon par nazar daalati he"
 niabandh ke anya vishyon main, 'filmon ke moolyankan,' tolaken ke mul vishay kii tulana main mahilaon kaa prastutiran, film ke samarthan main prayukt daleelon kii aalochana or upanyaas or iske stroton se film main nayak or veerta kaa prastutikaran kaa moolyankan ke rup main shaamil he
 Cathy ackers-jordan, Jane Chance, Victoria Guidosic, and Maureen Thum argue that Tolkien's portrayal of women, especially Arwen's portrayal, despite differences in writing and film, is overall narrative
 David Bratman strongly criticized many of the arguments for the film's adaptation of the book, stating that "it is the imagination of Jackson, not Tolkien", "but he has really worked on it", "his effort in the book
 Sure produces new readers "," If seen the entire film will be around 40 hours "and the book is still on the shelf
 
 unhone ye bhi likhaa he ki " peter jackson ke paas tolkin kii nau varshon kii samaj he" or unhone film kii drishyon or manch sajja ko e kaa darja, kitaab se alag swatantra kaary ko bi kaa darja, tolkin kii kahani or vyorevar rup se varnan ke prati vshvasaneeyata ko si kaa darja or tolkin kii bhaavana or lahaze ke prati eemaandaaree ko di kaa darja diya he
 Dan Timmons writes that Frodo's portrayal secretly harms the film's subject matter and internal logic, which he considers to be a weakness of Tolkien's original form
 kaayla mckini vigins kaa maananaa he ki tolkin ke lekhan or strot saamagree main nayak kaa jo lakshan he use film main galat samajha gaya he or film main nayak ke charitra main vikaas kii jagah saahasik kaary par dhyaan diya gaya he
 Janet Brennan Croft has criticized Tolkien using his own terms of possibility and flatness, which he used to criticize the script of the proposed film
 unhone jackson ke "bahut zyada kam samay" kii manodasha ke saath tolkin kii sookshmata kii tulana kii he
 After the release of these films, it was seen that people were interested in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and other books and their impact on popular culture began to increase rapidly
 triology par tolkin parivaar main matbhed hone kaa afvaah bhi failaa tha jisamen christopher tolkin or simon tolkin ke bich iske film main rupantaran ke vichaar ke sahi hone yaa nahin hone ko lekar asahmati bani hui thi
 Christopher Tolkien refuted these claims, stating, "I myself believe that the Lord of the Rings scene in particular is unsuitable for change in theatrical form
 jo film ke liye suzav diya gaya he use main asweekrut karata hum, yahaan tak ki jinke vichaar mujhase alag hai main unke bare main bura sochataa hum, ye puri tarah se bebuniyaad he
 At the same time he stated that "no such feelings were expressed

 The short version was launched in London, UK in the summer of 2007

 The success of the triology resulted in Peter Jackson becoming a player in the film business, like Steven Spellberg and George Lucas, and in the process of friendship with some industry veterans such as Brian Singer, Frank Darabont and James Cameron

 udaarvaadiyon ke siddhanth kaa khandan karte hue bismark ne 1862 main apni niti is prakaar spasht kii- Bismarck was convinced that the unification of Germany would never be accepted by France, Russia, England and Austria because united Germany would be the biggest threat to Europe's power balance
 atah bismark ko yah vishwaas ho gaya tha ki germany ke ekikaran ke liye shakti kaa prayog anivaary he
 The main objective of Bismarck was to consolidate Germany under the leadership of Prasha by making Austria powerful from the German Union and ending its influence in Germany
 iske liye aavashyak tha ki rajya kii sabhi satta va adhikaar raja main kendrit hon
 Bismarck believed in monarchy
 atah usne rajtantr ke kendra bindu par hi samast germany kii rashtriyata ko ek sutara main baandhne kaa praytn kiya
 During his entire program, Bismarck took special care not to destroy the pride of Prussia for the unification of Germany
 vah prasha kaa balidaan karne ko taiyaar nahin tha, jaisaa ki peedmont ne italy ke ekikaran ke liye kiya
 He wanted to integrate Germany in the administration itself
 bismark neeche ke str se germany kaa ekikaran nahin chahta tha, arthath udaaravaadi tareeke se janata main ekikaran kii bhaavana jaagrit karne ke badale va vah upar se ekikaran karnaa chahta tha arthath kootneeti evam rakt evam lohe kii nitiyon dwaara vah chahta tha ki german rajyon kii adhinsth sthiti ho, prasha kii nahin
 From this point of view, he wanted to control Germany rather than Germany
 bismark 1832 main austria kaa chancelar bana or apni kootneeti, sooyeeboojh rakt evam louh kii niti ke dwaara germany kaa ekikaran purna kiya
 After unification in 1870, Bismarck declared that Germany was a contented nation and was not interested in colonial expansion
 is tarah usne germany ke vistaar sambandhi ashankaon ko dur karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Bismarck had to go through the internal problems of Germany
 in samasyaon ke samaadhaan usne prastut kiye
 But the complexity of the problems forced him to resign in 1890
 ekikaran ke pashchaat germany main audyogikaran teji se hua
 There was a huge increase of workers in the factories, but their situation was low there, there was no proper arrangement for their living and eating
 aarthik or saamaajik sthiti kharaab hone ke kaaran samaajwaadiyon kaa prabhaav badhane laga or unhen apana prabal shatru maanata tha
 There were many types of laws throughout Germany
 ekikaran ke dauraan hue yudhon se aarthik sansadhano kii kami ho gayi thi
 As a result, the country's economic progress was being hampered
 bismark ko dharmik samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, the people of Prussia were followers of Protestant religion, while the subjects of other states of Germany were mostly followers of Catholicism
 catholic log bismark ke ekikaran ke prabal virdohi the kyonki unhen bhay tha ki protestant prasha unka daman kar degaa
 German Catholics were angered by Bismarck defeating Austria and France, as both were Catholic countries
 rome se pope kii satta samaapt ho jane se german catholic kurddh ho uthe or unhone bismark kaa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 For economic unity and development, Bismarck introduced the same type of currency throughout Germany
 yatayaat kii suvidha ke liye railway board kii sthapana kii or usee se telegraph vibhaag ko sambhddha kar diya
 Banks were established on behalf of the state
 vibhinn rajyon main prachlit kanoonon ko sthaagith kar diya gaya or aise kanoonon kaa nirmaan kiya jo sampurna german samrajya main samaan rup se prachlit hue
 To deal with the socialists, Bismarck passed a very stringent Act in 1878 prohibiting the gathering of socialists
 unke pramukh netaaon ko jail main daal diya gaya
 Newspapers and literature were strictly banned
 in damankaaree upayon ke saath-saath bismark ne mazdooron ko samaajwaadiyon se dur karne ke liye "rajya-samaajwaad" kaa prayog karnaa shuru kiya
 Under this, he showed to the workers that the state itself is striving for the welfare of the workers
 usanke mazdooron kii bhalaai ke liye anek beemaa yojanaayen, pension yojanaayen lagu kii
 Working hours of women and children were fixed
 bismark kaa yah 'rajya samaajwaad' vaastavik samaajwaad nahin tha, kyonki vah janatantr kaa virdohi tha or poonjeevaad kaa samarthan tha
 Bismarck patronized German industries for industrial advancement, which increased industries and production
 taiyaar maal ko bechney ke liye nai mandiyon kii aavashyaktaa thi
 This need prompted Bismarck's adoption of colonial policy
 faltah 1884 i
 main bismark ne africa ke purvi ore dakshini-pashchimi bhaagon main anek vyapaarik chaukiyon kii sthapana kii or teen samraaton ke sangh se baahar ho gaya
 He said that Bismarck lost a friend by favoring one friend
 bismark ke liye austria kii mitrataa zyada laabhadaayak thi kyonki austria ke madhya sandhi hone kii sthiti main germany kaa prabhaav zyada rahata atah 1879 main ek dwigut sandhi hui
 5 Russia's disappearance from Germany became a matter of concern for Bismarck
 use laga ki kahin rus france ke saath koi maitri sandhi na kar le
 Therefore, he immediately tried to improve relations with Russia
 1881 main use safalataa bhi mili
 Now there was a treaty between Germany, Russia and Austria
 5 ab bismark ne italy kii ore dhyaan diya or italy se sandhi kar france ko europea raajnneeti main bilkul alag kar dena chaha
 At the same time, both France and Italy were keen on seizing Tunis in Africa
 bismark ne france ko tunis par adhikaar karne ke liye protsaahit kiya taaki france main germany ke paksh main sadbhaavna fail jaae or france samrajyavad main ulajhaa jaae, jisase germany se badla lene kii baat dur ho jaae
 France took over Tunis in 1881, which angered Italy
 italy kii naaraazgi kaa laabh uthaakar bismark ne 1882 main italy, germany or austria ke bich trigut sandhi ko anjaam diya
 Bismarck gave birth to a new 'treaty system'
 sandhi kar usne vibhinn guton kaa nirmaan kiya
 The feature of this treaty system was that generally all the treaties that have happened in history took place during the war
 kintu bismark ne shaantikaal main sandhi pranali ko janm dekar ek naveen drushtikon saamne rakhaa
 Union of the Three Emperors: Bismarck was the first step under the treaty system in the field of foreign policy
 1872 main teen samraaton ke sangh kaa nirmaan kiya isamen austria kaa samraat francis joseph, rus kaa jaar dwitiya tathaa germany kaa samraat willian pratham shaamil tha
 Although it was not a written treaty between these three countries, some things were agreed upon
 ve is baat par sahamat hue the ki europe main shaanti banaae rakhane tathaa samaajawaadee aandolan se nipatane ke liye ve ek-duusare ke saath sahyog evam vichaar vinimay karte rahe
 This treaty was Bismarck's great diplomatic victory, because on the one hand he befriended the defeated power of Sedova, Austria and on the other hand, ended the possibility of friendship of Austria and Russia for France
 kintu kuch samay pashchaat yah sangh tut gaya kyonki balcon kshetra main rus or austria ke hit aapas takaraate the
 Therefore, Bismarck had to choose between Russia and Austria
 1878 kii berlin kii sandhi main bismark ko rus or austria main se kisi ek ko chunanaa tha, jisamen usne austria kaa paksh liya
 As a result, Russia became angry with him
 dharmik muddon se nitapane or rajya ko sarvopari banane ke liye bismark ne carch ke viruddh kai kanoon paas kiye
 In 1872, the Jesuits were boycotted and Prasha and the Pope broke up
 1873 main paarit kanoon ke anusaar vivaah rajya nyaayalayon kii ajna se hone laga jisamen carch kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin rah gayi
 The state got the authority over the educational institutions and the government assistance to the church was discontinued
 in kanoonon ke baavjood bhi catholic jhuke nahin
 Therefore, Bismarck considered the challenges of the Socialists more dangerous and compromised with the Catholics
 iske tahat catholic ke viruddh kanoon radd kar die gaye or pope se raajnneetik sambandh sthapit kiya
 After the reunification of Germany, the main objective of Bismarck's foreign policy in 1871 was to maintain Germany's dominance in Europe
 niti nirdhaaran ke taur par usne ghoshit kiya ki germany tusht rajya he or kshetreey vistaar main isaki koi ruchi nahin he
 Bismarck was most feared by France because he had obtained the territory of elsse-laurent from France, which made France very dissatisfied
 bismark ko vishwaas tha ki francisi apni 1870-71 kii paraajay or alses-lauren kshetra ko nahin bhuulenge
 Therefore, the main objective of his foreign policy was to keep France friendless in Europe so that it would not be in a position to fight Germany
 is tarah bismark kii videsh niti ke aadharbhoot siddhanth the- vyaavhaarik avasarwaadi kootneeti kaa prayog kar german virdohi shaktiyon ko alag-thalag rakhana evam france ko mitra viheen bananaa, udaarvaad kaa virodh evam sanyavad main aasthaa rakhana
 His treaty system gave rise to rivalries
 faltah europe main tanaavpurn vaataavaran ban gaya or is prakaar europe pratham vishwayuddh ke kagaar par pahunch gaya
 Bismarck's foreign policy encouraged militarization and armament in Europe
 is niti ne europe ko pratham vishwayuddh kii dahalij tak pahunchaa diya
 Bismarck signed all treaties with conflicting nations
 unke bich samanvay banaae rakhana atyant dushkar kaary tha, jise keval bismark jaisaa kootneetijna hi kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, after the resignation of the post in 1890, this method became fatal and groups like France, Russia etc
 were formed against Germany
 is prakaar bismark kii videsh niti ne prakarantar se pratham vishwayuddh kii prishthbhumi kaa nirmaan kar diya
 Bismarck's policy of factionalism led to the formation of a second bloc against Germany and eventually Europe was divided into two armed and powerful factions
 jisaki charam parinti pratham vishwayuddh main dikhaai padi
 In 1887, Bismarck signed a resettlement treaty with Russia, under which the two pledged to support each other
 yah sandhi gupt rakhi gai thi
 This was Bismarck's diplomatic victory as Germany simultaneously enjoyed the friendship of Russia and Austria
 bismark ne britain ke saath maitreepurn sambandh banane kaa praytn kiya
 Bismarck believed that Britain was a naval power and would not be hostile to any nation until its navy was challenged
 atah britain ko khush karne liye bismark ne german nausena ko badhaane ko koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 To please Britain, he declared that Germany was not an imperialist country
 duusari taraf england kii france ke saath aupniveshik pratidwandita thi jiskaa laabh uthaakar bismark ne britain ke saath madhur sambandh banaae
 There is a village in Seksanipalla in Anantapur district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 peshishoshi parshv kaathinya gatijanak neuron rog kaa ek rup he
 ALS is a progressive, fatal, neuro-degenerative disease caused by the depletion of a motor neuron, a mechanism of the central nervous system that controls voluntary muscle activity
 uttari america main is avasthaa ko lokapriy neuyork yankis besabaal khilaadi ke naam par aksar lau gehrig rog kaha jaataa he, 1939 main jinka is rog se peedit ke rup main nidaan kiya gaya tha
 Due to this disorder, the muscles of the whole body become weak and weakened due to depletion of the upper and lower motile neuron
 kaary karne main asamarth, mansapeshiyaan kamazor ho jaati hai or apkshay hone lagata he
 Affected individuals eventually lose the ability to initiate and control voluntary movements, although the bladder and bowel, anal fleshy muscles, and muscles responsible for eye movement survive this effect, but not always
 adhikansh rogiyon main sangyanatmak kaary aam taur par prabhavit nahin hote, yadhyapi kuch main lalatshankhaasthic manobhransh bhi hota he
 a high proportion of patients have more subtle cognitive changes that remain unseen but are revealed in detailed neuropsychological testing
 samvedi tantrikaayen or swytt tantrika tantra, joki paseene jaisi gatividhiyon ko niyantrit karata he, aam taur par aprabhavit rahete hai lekin kuch rogi isaki chapet main bhi aa jate hai
 The initial symptoms of ALS are markedly obvious weakness and / or muscle atrophy
 anya prastut lakshanon main shaamil hai mansapeshiyon kaa sankirnan, anthan, yaa prabhavit mansapeshiyon kii jakadan; ek haath yaa ek pair mansapeshi kii kamajori se prabhavit hona; or / yaa aspasht uccharan or naak se bolnaa
 ALS ke praarambhik lakshanon se sharir ke koun se ang prabhavit honge yah is par nirbhar karata he ki sharir ke koun se gatijanak neuron pehle kshatigrast ho rahe hai
 Approximately 75% of people with this disease experience "organ onset" ALS, ie the first symptoms in the arms or legs
 pair se shuruyaat vaale marizon ko chalate samay yaa bhaagate samay atapataapan mahasoos ho saktaa he yaa unhen lagata he ki ve ladkadaa rahe hai yaa thokar kha rahe hon, aksar "latakate pair" ke saath, jo zamin par ghaseetata chalata he
 Hand-started patients find difficulty in hand-held agility and skillful tasks, such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or moving a key in a lock
 Sometimes, symptoms remain confined to a single organ for a long period of time or throughout the duration of the disease; This is known as intercostal musculature
 lagbhag 25% maamle "kandiy shuruuaat" ALS ke hote hai
 These palms first have difficulty speaking or swallowing clearly
 baatcheet aspasht ho jaati he, jisaki prakruti nasiky yaa shant hoti he
 Other symptoms include difficulty swallowing, and tongue mobility
 Relatively fewer patients experience ALS "onset of respiration", in which intercostal muscles are affected first
 bhale hi rog dwaara pehle prabhavit sharir kaa koi bhi ang ho, rog ke badhane ke saath-saath peshiyon kii kamazori or sankuchan anya angon tak bhi failane lagata he
 Patients experience much difficulty walking, swallowing and speaking or coining words

 ek asaamaanya prativarti kriya bhi, jise aam taur par babinski chihn kaha jaataa he, upree gatijanak neuron kii kshati kaa sanket detaa he
 Symptoms of damage to a lower motor neuron include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle spasms, and transient muscle twitch that can be seen under the skin
 Approximately 15–45% of patients experience cryptic effects, also known as "emotional imbalance", which include laughing uncontrollably, crying, or smiling, thanks to tuberculosis resulting in the exaggeration of dynamic expressions of emotion
 Damage to the upper motor neuron can be given
 ALS ke saath rog nidaan kiye rogiyon main upree or nichle gatijanak neuron kshati, donon ke sanket or lakshan hone chahie, jiske or koi kaaran nahin ho sakate hai
 Although the sequence of symptoms of the disease and the rate of progression of the disease varies from person to person, eventually most patients are unable to stand or walk, neither get up or lie on their own, or on their own Are able to use hands and arms
 nigalane or chabane main aane vaali kathinaayee mariz kii saamaanya rup se khaane kii kshamta ko ksheen bana detii he or gale main atak jane kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 Maintaining weight can then become a problem

 a small percentage of patients develop frontotemporal dementia that is seen as a severe personality change; It is very common in individuals with a family history of dementia
 rogiyon kaa ek bada anupaat shabd rachana, dhyaan kendrit karne, yaa nirnay lene kii kshamtaaon main halki samasyaon kaa anubhav karte hai
 Cognitive activities may be affected as part of the disease process or may be related to breathing at night
 swasthya ke dekhbhaalkarta peshewaron ke liye zaruri he ki rog kii prakriya kii vyakhya or uplabdh upachaar vikalpon ke bare main spasht karen taaki rogiyon ko pehle se hi nirnay suchit kar sakate hai
 The weakening of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles reduces the strong vital capacity and suppressive pressure
 ALS ke kandiy prarambh main, haath-pair kii kamazori spasht rup se nazar aane se pehle bhi ho saktaa he
 Two-stage positive pressure ventilation is often used to support breathing, first at night and again during the day
 yah sifaarish kii jaati he ki isse pehle ki bipap aparyaapt ban jaae, marizon ko chahie ki shwasapranalchhedan or dirghakaalin yantric sanvathan karwaane kaa nirnay len
 is bindu par, kuch rogiyon ne upshaamak ashram main dekhbhaal kaa chayan kiya
 Most people with ALS often die of respiratory failure or pneumonia
 aam taur par nidaan ke do se paanch saal ke bheetar maut hoti he
 Although the disease can occur at any age, most people are between the ages of forty and seventy when they are attacked by this disease and men are often more vulnerable than women
 sanyukt rajya america main har saal anumaanit rup se 5000 log is rog se prabhavit paae gaye hai
 Half of those diagnosed with ALS, a progressive disease, die in three years and ninety percent in six years
 ALS mukhyatah gatijanak neuronon ko prabhavit karata he or adhikansh maamalon main rog mariz ke man, vyaktitv, buddhi, yaa smriti ko ksheen nahin karata he
 Nor does it affect a person's ability to see, smell, taste, hear, or feel touch
 aankh kii mansapeshiyon kaa niyantran sabase sangrakshit kaary he, haalanki lambey samay tak is beemaari se peedit rogi ankhon par niyantran bhi kho sakate hai
 In contrast to multicellular disease, ALS generally has preserved bladder and bowel control, although bowel problems such as sedation and dietary changes require intensive management of bowel problems such as constipation
 bina is rog ke kisi paariwarik itihaas vaale rogiyon main, jisamen ~95% maamle shaamil hai, ALS kaa koi gyaat kaaran nahin he
 There are known hereditary factors in family ALS, where this condition persists in families, although only 5% of all cases are such
 ek gunasutra 21 par viraasat main praapt anuvanshik dosha ALS ke lagbhag 20% paariwarik maamalon se juda he
 This mutation has been considered to be autosomal dominant
 A4V uttari america main sabase aam ALS he jo SOD1 utparivartan kaa kaarak he, jisaki visheshta, isaki shuruyaat se mrityu tak kii asaadhaaran tej pragati he
 Children diagnosed with familial ALS are more likely to suffer from this disease in their children; However, people with immediate family members who detect sporadic ALS are not at greater risk than normal people, which again suggests a possibility of environmental or genetic causes
 pashchimi prashanth kshetra main in ghatnaon main hui vruddhi ke liye kuch paryaavarniya karkon ko sujhaayaa gaya he
 In Guam, the long-term effect of a dietary neurotoxin called BMAA has been considered a potential factor; This neurotoxin produced by the cyano bacteria present in the seeds of the cycad Cycus sarsinalis, a tropical plant available in Guam, is one of several potential factors that were used as human foods in the 1950s and early 1960s
 italvi footbal khilaadiyon ke bich is rog kii bahut zyaada maujuudagi ne footbaal maidan main prayukt kitnashkon or bimariyon ke bich sambhavit sambandh ke prati chintaa badha di he
 a 2004 Italian study attempting to relate the presence of more ALS incidence in football players to performance enhancing drugs failed when comparing this group with cyclists using the same PED But in which the presence of ALS was zero
 ek sambhavit nishkarsh yah tha ki footbal khilaadiyon ko cycle savaaron kii tulana main lagaataar sir ke aghaton ko sahanaa padataa he, jabaki cycle savaaron ke paas helmet hota he or ve shaayad hi kabhi girte hai
 According to the ALS Association, elderly soldiers in the United States are at higher risk of having ALS
 ALS in da military naamak apni report main, samooh ne saamaanya janata kii apeksha buzurg sainikon main is rog kii lagbhag 60% adhik sambhaavna kii ore ingit kiya he
 a joint study by the Department of Elder Affairs and another pandemic association DOD has revealed that it is twice as likely for veterans of the Gulf War than for soldiers not deployed in the Persian Gulf to be exposed to toxic risks
 Expresses the possibility of relationship
 2010 ke ek adhyayan ne kuch bujurgon or athleton main ALS roganidan par kuch prashn uthaae hai, jo yah sujhaate hai ki lagaataar dimagi aghaton se dardanaak mastishk vikruti paidaa ho sakati he, jo ALS jaisi hi ho sakati he; yah un logon main ALS roganidan kii adhik dar kaa kaaran samajha sakati he
 Template: MEDRS ALS kii nirdharak visheshta, mastishk ke gatijanak praantastha, kapaly stambh tathaa ridh kii haddi main upree tathaa nichle, donon gatijanak upree motor neurons kaa ant he
 Prior to this destruction, motile neurons develop proteinic insertions in their cell bodies and axons
 in antarveshnon main aksar ubicutin shaamil rahete hai or saamanytah ALS sambandhi koi protein samavisht karte hai: SOD1, TAR DNA badhyakaari protein, yaa FUS
 dilachasp rup se, ye antarveshan congou red yaa theoflavin s ranjakon ke saath rangeen nahin hote hai or is kaaran gair-emiloid samucchy hai
 It differs from the aggregates and plaques seen in other neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein aggregates, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Prion's disease
 anuvanshik sanghon main shaamil hai: The causes of ALS are not known, although an important step in determining the cause was taken when in 1993 scientists discovered that mutations in the gene causing the Cu / Zn superoxide dismutase enzyme are associated with some cases of familial ALS
 ye kinvak shaktishaalee oxicrenrodhi hai jo mitocondria main utpann ek vishaaktata mukt mulankur, superoxide ke kaaran hui kshati se sharir kii raksha karata he
 Free radicals are highly reactive molecules, mainly produced by cells during normal metabolism by mitochondria
 mukt mulankur jamaa ho sakate hai or koshikaon ke andar donon, mitocondria tathaa nabhikeey DNA tathaa proteinon ko kshati pahunchaa sakate hai
 To date, 110 different types of mutations in SOD1 have been associated with the disease, some of which have very long clinical periods, while others such as A4V are exceptionally aggressive
 saboot bataate hai ki anya kai sambhavya parinaamon ke bich, upachaayak tanaav ke prati pratiraksha kii vifaltaa kramadeshit koshika ant ko niyantrit karata he
 Although it is not yet clear how the SOD1 gene mutation leads to motor neuron degeneration, researchers have speculated that the defective action of this gene may lead to accumulation of free radicals
 vartmaan anusandhan, haalanki yah sanket detaa he ki gatijanak neuron kaa ant sambhavit rup se vyutparivartan kriya ke samaapan yaa jokhim kaa parinaam nahin he, jo yah suzav detaa he ki utparivarti SOD1 kisi anya tareeqe se vishaaktata prerit karata he
 Studies on transgenic mice have yielded several theories regarding the role of SOD1 in mutant SOD1 family myocardial lateral sclerosis
 SOD1 jin kii kami vaale chuuhe puri tarah paaramparik taur par ALS se prabhavit nahin hote he, haalanki ve umr se jude peshiy shosh or hrasweekrut jivanavadhi ke twaran ko pradarshit karte hai
 This suggests that the toxic properties of mutant SOD1 are the result of action progression rather than damage to normal function
 iske alaava, paaya gaya ki protein kaa ekatrikaran bhi, donon, paariwarik or chhitput ALS kaa ek aam naidanik lakshan he 
 dilachasp rup se, utparivarti SOD1 chuhon main, keval rogagrast utakon main hi utparivarti SOD1 ke samucchy paae gaye or gatijanak neuron apjanan ke dauraan adhik maatra main paae gaye
 It has been hypothesized that aggregation of mutant SOD1 plays a role in disrupting cellular functions by damaging mitochondria, proteasomes, protein folding chaperones, or other proteins
 aisa koi vyavdhaan, agar siddh ho to, is siddhant main mahatvapurn vishwasaneeyata paidaa karegaa ki samucchy utparivarti SOD1 kii vishaaktata main shaamil hai
 Critics have found that in humans, SOD1 mutations account for only about 2% of all cases, and the diagnostic mechanisms may differ from those responsible for sporadic forms of the disease
 aaj tak, ALS-SOD1 chuuhe beemaari ke purv naidanik adhyayan ke liye sabase achche namoonay rahe hai, lekin aashaa kii jaati he ki or adhik upyogi model viksit kiye jaaenge
 Studies have emphasized the role of glutamate in motor neuron pathology
 glutamet mastishk ke rasinic sandesavaahakon yaa neurotransmitron main se ek he
 Scientists have found that ALS patients have higher levels of serum and spinal fluid glutamate than healthy people
 vartmaan main ALS ke liye keval riluzol FDA anumodith dawa he or glutamet sanvaahakon ko lakshyankit karata he
 It has a minor effect on survival, however, suggesting that glutamate overdose is not the only cause of the disease
 koi pareekshan ALS kaa ek nishchit nidaan nahin pradaan karata hai, haalanki ek hi ang main upree or nichle gatijanak neuron kii maujuudagi iskaa prabal sanket ho saktaa he
 Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs seen by the physician in the patient and several tests are performed to rule out the possibility of other diseases
 chikitsak mariz kii sampurna chikitsa-itihaas praapt karte hai or aam taur par niyamit antaraal main snaiviya pareekshan karte hai taaki mansapeshiyon kii kamazori, mansapeshiyon kaa sankuchan, atiprativartan or kathorta jaise lakshanon ke uttarottar kshati kaa akalan kar sake
 Because the symptoms of ALS resemble many other treatable diseases or disorders for a wide variety, appropriate testing is necessary to exclude the possibility of those diseases
 in pareekshanon main ek he electromyographi, ek vishesh recording takanic, jo mansapeshiyon main vidyutiya gatividhi kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Some EMG findings may support the diagnosis of ALS
 ek anya aam pareekshan tantrika pravaahakatva veg ko maapta he
 Results of specific abnormalities of NCV may suggest, for example, that the patient suffers from a form of peripheral neuropathy or from myopathy rather than ALS
 chikitsak chumbakeey anunaad pratibimban karwaane ke liye kah saktaa he, jo ek aprasarak prakriya he, jisamen mastishk or ridh kii haddi kii vistrut chhaviyon ko lene ke liye chumbakeey kshetra or radio tarang kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 While these MRI scans are often common in patients with ALS, they may reveal other symptoms that are causing these symptoms, such as spinal tumors, multi-sclerosis, disseminated discs in the neck, fistulitis Or brachialitis
 rogi ke lakshanon or pareekshanon ke nishkarshon ke aadhaar par tathaa in pareekshanon se chikitsak anya rogon kii ashanka ko dur karne ke liye, nemi prayogshaala pareekshanon ke saath-saath, rakt or mutr pareekshan kaa aadesh de saktaa he
 In some cases, for example, a muscle biopsy may be performed if a physician suspects that the patient is suffering from myopathy rather than ALS
 sankramak rog jaise ki human immunodefishienci virus, human T-cell leukemia virus, lim rog, upadansh or tik janit mastishkshoth virus kuch maamalon main als-jaise lakshan paidaa kar sakate hai
 Neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy, CIDP, and spinal muscular atrophy may mimic some aspects of the disease, and clinicians attempting to diagnose them should consider them

 The Food and Drug Administration has approved only one drug, Riluzole, for the treatment of the disease
 mana jaataa he ki riluzol, glutamet sanvaahakon ko sakriyan dwaara glutamet ke nirgaman ko kam karte hue gatijanak neuron ko pahunchane vaali kshati ko kam karata he
 In addition, the drug presents other neuroprotective effects by inhibition of sodium and calcium channels, inhibition of protein kinase C, and increased NMDA receptor antagonism
 ALS rogiyon par kiye gaye naidanik pareekshanon ne darshaya ki riluzol uttarjivita ko kai maheene aage badhaata he or kandaakaar shuruyaat se prabhavit logon ko or bhi adhik uttarjivita kaa laabh mil saktaa he
 The drug extends the period before the patient needs ventilation support

 Patients and carers can learn from language-pathologists and dietitians how to plan and prepare many foods that provide enough calories, fiber, and fluids throughout the day, and how to make a diet that is hard to swallow
 Removal can be done
 rogi, atirikt taral padaarth yaa laar nikaalane or gale main atakane se rokane ke liye chushan upkarnon kaa upyog karnaa shuru kar sakate hai
 When patients do not get enough nutrition from food, doctors may recommend inserting a tube to deliver food to the stomach
 aahaar daalane kii nalee ke upyog se gale main atakane or nimonia ke jokhim se bachaa ja saktaa he, jo fefdon main taral padaarthon ke antahshwasan ke parinamswaroop hota he
 The tube is not painful and does not prevent patients from eating it if they want to eat it by mouth
 jab saans lene main sahaayak mansapeshiyaan kamazor ho jaati hai, to saans lene main madad ke liye sanvatak sahaayta, bilevel positive airve pressure, yaa bifesic curas ventilation ) kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Such devices artificially inflate the patient's lungs from various external sources that are applied directly to the face or body
 jab mansapeshiyaan oxigen or carbon dioxide kaa str banaae rakhane main asamarth ho jaati hai, to puure samay ke liye in upkarnon ko istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The added benefit of BCV is that it is also capable of cleaning up the secreted substances by high-frequency oscillations and subsequent multiple active respiratory activities
 antat mariz yantriki sanvathan ke prakaaron par vichaar kar sakate hai jisamen mashin fefdon main hawa bharta or nikaalata he
 To be effective, it may require a tube running through the nose or mouth to the trachea and, for long-term use, may require an operation such as a tracheostomy, in which a plastic breathing tube can open the throat directly into the patient's trachea
 Is put in vikalpon main kisi ek kaa upyog karne yaa na karne ke bare main nirnay lete samay mariz or unke pariwaron ko kai karkon par vichaar karnaa hoga
 sanvathan upkaran kaa prabhaav mariz ke jivan kii gunvattta or laagat kii drushti se bhinn ho saktaa he
 Although ventilation support can be helpful in reducing breathing problems and prolonging survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS
 Patients need to be fully informed about these ideas and their long-term effects on sedentary life before making decisions regarding ventilation support
 dirghakaalin trekkiostomy ke adheen apsfiti kaff sahit aavartak sakriy daab sanvathan yaa kafarahit trekkiostomy tub ke saath kuch mariz bolne main samarth rahe, basharte ki unki kandaakaar mansapeshiyaan paryaapt majboot thim
 This technique retains speaking power in some patients with long-term mechanical ventilation
