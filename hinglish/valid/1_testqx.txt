 duwari subbarao kaa janm 11 agast 1949 ko hua
 He is an Indian economist, central banker
 ve 5 sitambar 2008 se 4 sitambar 2013 bhartiya reserve bank ke 22wein governor rahe
 Mr
 Subbarao is a 1972 batch officer of the Andhra Pradesh cadre of the Indian Administrative Service

 urdu bharat tathaa pakistan kii aadhunik bhartiya arya bhashaaon main se ek he
 It developed in the medieval period in the region of northern India, which today includes western Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and eastern Punjab
 iskaa aadhaar us praakrit or apbhransh par tha jise 'shauraseni' kehete the or jisase khadiboli, brajabhasha, haryani or punjabi aadi ne janm liya tha
 Due to the arrival of Muslims in India and settling in Punjab and Delhi, Persian and Arabic words were also included in the colloquial language of this region and gradually it took a different form
 musalamaanon kaa rajya or shashan sthapit ho jane ke kaaran aisa hona swaabhaavik bhi tha ki unke dharm, niti, rahan-sahan, aachaar-vichaar kaa rang us bhashaa main jhalkane lage
 Thus, some such tendencies were included in its development which were not required by other Indian languages of that time
 pashchimi uttar pradesh or dilli main bolchaal main khadiboli kaa prayog hota tha
 Based on the same, later the literary form of Urdu was determined
 isamen kaaphi samay laga, at: desh ke kai bhaagon main thode-thode antar ke saath is bhashaa kaa vikaas apane-apane dhang se hua
 The basic basis of Urdu is not only steep, but the dialects of other regions also have an impact on it
 aisa hona hi chahie tha, kyonki aarambh main isko bolanewaali yaa to bazaar kii janata thi athwa ve sufi-fakir the jo desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main gum-ghumkar apane vichaaron kaa prachaar karte the
 For this reason many names have been used for this language
 amir khusro ne usko "hindi", "hindvi" athwa "zabaane dehalavi" kaha tha; dakshin main pahaunchi to "dakini" yaa "dakkhini" kahalaai, gujarat main "gujri" kahi gai; dakshin ke kuch lekhakon ne use "zabaane-ahale-hindustan" bhi kaha
 When this language began to be used for poetry and especially Ghazal, it was called "rekha"
 baad main isi ko "zabaane urdu", "urdu-e-mualla" yaa keval "urdu" kaha jane laga
 European writers have commonly called it "hindustani" and some English writers have also referred to it as "moose"
 in kai naamon se is bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas par bhi prakaar padataa he
 Urdu is the same from the point of origin as Hindi; The only difference in view is that arabic-persian words are used more in Urdu and Sanskrit words are used more in Hindi
 isaki lipi devanagari se bhinn he or kuch muhaavaron ke prayog ne isaki style or dhaanche ko badal diya he
 But literary traditions and forms are all cast in another mold
 yah sab kuch aitihaasik kaarnon se hua he jiskaa thik-thik anumaan uske sahitya ke adhyayan se kiya ja saktaa he
 But before that one thing should be paid more attention
 'urdu' turki bhashaa kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he 'vah bazaar jo shahi sena ke saath-saath ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par chalata rahata tha'
 The mixed language spoken there was called the language of Urdu people, respectively, the same language itself started to be called Urdu
 is arth main is shabd kaa prayog 17veen shatabdi ke ant se miltaa he
 The initial form of Urdu is found either in the bani of Sufi fakirs or in the public discourse
 bhashaa kii drushti se urdu ke vikaas main punjabi kaa prabhaav sabase pehle dikhaai padataa he, kyonki jab 15veen or 16veen sadi main iskaa prayog dakshin ke kavi or lekhak saahitiyik rachanaaon ke liye karne lage to usamen punjabipan paryaapt maatra main paaya jaataa tha
 In the 17th and 18th centuries, Brajbhasha had a profound influence on Urdu and great scholars began to consider the "gwaliori language" more pure in poetry, but in the same era some scholars and poets used the words of Braj to give Urdu a new look
 Boycotted and began to increase the persian-arabic words
 dakshin main urdu kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 In northern India, she was considered a lower class language because she was different from the colloquial language of Delhi which had a glimpse of Persian literature and culture
 bolchaal bolchaal main yah bhedbhaav chaahe kuch adhik dikhaai na de kintu sahitya main style or shabdon ke vishesh prayog se yah vibhinnata bahut vyapak ho jaati he or badhate-badhate anek saahitiyik skulon kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he, jaise "dakan skool", "dilli skool", "lakhanu skool", "bihar skool" ityadi
 The truth is that in the struggle for the formation of Urdu language, the Iranian and Hindustani elements kept colliding with each other and gradually the Hindustani element was able to win over the Iranian element
 anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki jis bhashaa ko urdu kaha jaataa he usamen 85 pratishat shabd ve hi hai jinka aadhaar hindi kaa koi na koi rup he
 The remaining 15 percent includes words from Persian, Arabic, Turkish and other languages that naturally merged into Urdu in the days of Muslim rulers due to cultural reasons
 is samay urdu pakistan ke anek kshetron main, uttari bharatvarsh ke kai bhaagon main, kashmir or andhra pradesh main bahut se logon kii maatrubhaasha he
 It has been indicated that when Muslims came to India, their life was affected and they themselves were affected by the situation here
 unhone yahan kii bhashaayen sikhin or unamem apane vichaar prakat kiye
 The first name of Khwaja Masoud Saad Salman of Lahore is collected, which collected his poetry collection in Hindi which unfortunately is not received today
 usee samay main kai sufi fakiron ke naam milte hai jo desh ke kone-kone main gum phirakar janata main apane vichaaron kaa prachaar kar rahe the
 It is not difficult to guess that at that time there would not have been a made-up language, so they would be able to work by mixing the words of Persian Arabic in the colloquial language
 iske bahut se udhaaharan sufiyon ke sambandh main likhi hui pustakon main mil jate hai
 Some of the people who have received poems or sentences are: Baba Farid Shakarganj, Sheikh Hamiduddin Nagauri, Sheikh Sharafuddin Abu Ali Qalandar, Amir Khusro, Makhdoom Ashraf Jahangir, Sheikh Abdulhaq, Syed Gesu Darz, Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri, Sheikh Bahaduddin Bajan etc
 iname bachan or dohare is baat kaa pataa dete hai ki ek aisi bhashaa ban rahi thi jo janasadhran samaj saktaa tha or jiskaa rup duusari boliyon se bhinn tha
 Among the poets above, Amri Khusro and Gesu Daraz have great importance in the early history of Urdu literature
 khusro kii hindi rachanaayen, jinka kuch ansh dilli kii khadiboli main hone ke kaaran urdu kaha jaataa he, devanagari main bhi prakashit ho chuki hai, parantu gesu daraaj ke lekhon or kavitaaon kii khoj abhi jari he
 By this time, "chakkinaam", "tilawatul Vajad", "merajnama" have been received, Sufi ideas have been expressed in all these
 gesu daraaj dilli nivasee the parantu unka zyada samay dakshin main beetaa, vahiin unki mrityu hui or isi kaaran unki bhashaa ko dakkini urdu kaha jaataa he
 The truth is that Urdu, which took the form of a language around Delhi, reached other parts of the country with armies, Sufi fakirs, government employees and businessmen and grew and spread by finding the right environment
 urdu ke saahitiyik rup ke praarambhik vikaas ke chihn sabase pehle dakshin or gujarat main dikhaai padate hai
 In addition to Gesu Daraz, Miranji Shamsul Ushaqqah, Burhanuddin Janam, Nizami, Firoz, Mahmud, Aminuddin Ala have left compositions that can each find a place in the history of Urdu literature
 bahamani rajya ke patan ke pashchaat jab dakshin main paanch rajya bane to urdu ko unnati karne kaa or avasar mila
 To keep in touch with the public, emperors also gave Urdu the main place
 golkunda or bijapur main sahitya or kala kaushal kii unnati hui
 In order to break away from Delhi and express his independence, he adopted this native language against Persian and encouraged the courage of litterateurs
 bijapur ke ibrahim adilshaah ne apni suvikhyath rachana "nauras" 16veen shatabdi ke ant main prastut kii
 There is a combination of Braj and Khadiboli, Persian Arabic words also come in between
 parantu iskaa puraa dhaanchaa ekmaatr hindustani he
 All its songs are written based on Indian music
 isaki bhoomika farsi ke suprasiddh vidwaan, "zahuri" ne farsi main likhi jo "sehansr" ke naam se aaj bhi mahatv rakhti he
 Other other kings of Bijapur were also the patrons of poets and poets
 inamen "aatshi", "muqimi", "amin", "rusatami", "kushnood", "daulatshaah" ke naam smaraneey hai
 In the last days of Bijapur, Urdu story poet "nusrati" was born who wrote the best poems in Shringar and Veeras
 bijapur kii hi bhanti golkunda main bhi badshaah or janata sab adhiktar urdu hi main likh rahe the
 Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah himself wrote poems in Urdu, Persian and Telugu and encouraged poets
 uske kavyasangrah main bharat ke mausamon, falon, phulon, chidiyon or tyohaaron kaa vicitra varnan miltaa he
 Those who became king after him were also good poets and their collections also exist
 prasiddh kaviyon or lekhakon main "vajahi", "gauvvasi", "ibne nishaati", "gulantli" ityadi mahatv rakhte hai
 Thus this first literary form of Urdu in the south gave rise to some such works which are admirable both in terms of literature and contemplation
 in rachanaaon main kuliate qaliqutabashah, qutub mushatari, phalban, seful-muluk va badiul jamaal, manohar madhumalati, chandrabadan va mahayaar ityadi urdu kii shreshth rachanaaon main gini jaati hai
 Before the end of the 17th century, Gujarat had reached Arcot, Mysore and Madras
 gujarat main isaki unnati adhiktar sufi kaviyon ke haathon hui jinamein sheikh bajan, showelogyu or koob mohammad chishti kii rachanaayen bahut mahatv rakhti hai
 Because the traditions of Urdu had been formed and they had been organized in almost 300 years, when the Mughals merged the South into their kingdom in 1687 AD, even then the fountains of Urdu literature did not dry but the poetry progressed at a faster pace Of
 17veen shatabdi ke ant or 18veen shatabdi ke aarambh main "vali" dakkini, "baheri", "vajahi", "vali", "velori, "seraj", "daaud" or "uzalat" jaise kaviyon ne janm liya
 Among them, "wali", "dakkini", "bahri", "seraj" are counted among the great poets of Urdu
 "vali" ko to uttari or dakshini bharat ke bich kii kadi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is clear that Urdu was the colloquial language of Delhi, but due to the influence of Persian, educated people met their cultural needs from Persian itself
 ve samajhate the ki urdu se inaki purti nahin ho sakati
 This confusion was dispelled with "wali" and his poetry reaching northern India and suddenly there was a radical change in the literary condition of northern India
 thode hi samay main dilli sainkadon urdu kaviyon kii vaani se goonj uthi
 Now Delhi school of Urdu starts
 yah baat smaraneey he ki yah samant kaal ke patan kaa yug tha
 The Mughal rule was not only weak from inside, but was also attacked from outside
 is sthiti se janata kii bolchaal kii bhashaa ne laabh uthaaya
 If the state had prevailed, neither Nadir Shah would have looted Delhi nor the language of the people would have taken the form of the main language instead of Persian
 is samay ke kaviyon main kaane aarazu, aabru, hatim, yakarang, naji,mazamoon, taabaan,, fugaan, "mazahar janejaanaa", "faayez" ityadi urdu sahitya main bahut unchaa sthaan rakhte hai
 Management poems and marcias had progressed in the south, Ghazal dominated in Delhi
 yahan kii pragatisheel bhashaa hriday ke sookshm bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye dakshini bhashaa kii apeksha adhik samarth thi isliye ghazal kii unnati swaabhaavik jaan padati he
 It is also worth remembering that Shringar Rasa and Bhakti ideas have got a prominent place in the poems of this time
 sainkadon varsh ke puraane samaaj kii baadh ruk gai thi or jivan ke saamne koi nayaa lakshya nahin tha isliye is samay kii kavita main koi shakti or udaartaa nahin dikhalaai padati
 Before the end of the 18th century, on the one hand, new political powers were raising their heads, which was weakening the Mughal state, on the other hand, that civilization was showing the last of the pathological beauty of its traditions
 dilli main urdu kavita or sahitya ke liye aisi sthiti paidaa ho rahi thi ki uski pahunch rajdurbar tak ho gai
 Mughal emperor Shah Alam himself wrote poetry and gave shelter to poets
 is yug main jin kaviyon ne urdu sahitya kaa sir unchaa kiya, ve hai mir dard, mirza mohammad rafi sauda, mir taqi "mir" or "mir soz"
 The depth and height of his ideas, the beauty of the language and artistic proficiency are appreciated from every point of view
 "dard" ne sufi vichaar ke kavy main, "mir" ne ghazal main or "sauda"duusari vidhaon ke saath qaside ke kshetron main urdu kavita kii seemayen vistrut kar di
 But the days had come very bad
 east india company kaa dabaav badhata ja rahaa tha or dilli kaa rajsinghaasana dawandol tha
 Being compelled, Shah Alam gave himself up in defense of the company and left Delhi with a pension and started living like prisoners in Prayag
 iskaa fal yah hua ki bahut se kavi or kalakaar anya sthanon ko chale gaye
 At this time some new courts were established, such as Hyderabad, Awadh, Azimabad, Farrukhabad, etc
 inaki nai jyoti or jagamagaahat ne bahut se kaviyon ko apni ore khinchaa
 The most attractive was the court of Awadh, where the Nawabs wanted to mix the glow of their court with the glow of the Mughal court
 dilli kii sthiti kharaab hote hi "fugaan", "sauda", "mir", "hasan" or kuch samay baad musahafi, insha, jubit or anya kavi avadh pahunch gaye or vahaan kavyrachana kaa ek nayaa centre ban gaya jisko "lakhanu skool" kaha jaataa he
 Lucknow became the capital of Awadh in 1775 AD
 usee samay se yahan farsi-arabi kii shiksha bade paimaane par anrabh hui or avadhi ke prabhaav se urdu main nai mithaas utpann hui
 Because the Nawabs of this place were Shia Muslims and wanted to elevate and adorn the Shia religion, it created some new trends in poetry that distinguish Lucknow poetry from Delhi poetry
 urdu sahitya ke itihaas main dilli or lakhanu skool kii tulana bada rochak vishay bani rahi he; parantu sach yah he ki sanmati yug kii patansheel simaaon ke andar dilli or lakhanu main kuch bahut antar nahin tha
 It is of course that in Lucknow, there was a greater emphasis on language and the external form of life, and on emotions in Delhi
 parantu vastut: dilli kii hi saahitiyik paramparaayen thim jinhone lakhanu kii badali hui sthiti main yah rup dhaaran kiya
 The poets here are "mir", "mir Hasan", "sauda", "insha", "musahfi", "juraat", followed by Atish, Nasikh, "anos", "dabir", "wazir", "naseem"
 , "rashk", "rind" and "saba" hold high positions
 lakhanu main marasia or masanvi kii vishesh rup se unnati karne kaa avasar mila
 Literature was also being produced outside Lucknow and Delhi schools and these works were close to the public sentiment due to the influence of the courts
 is sambandh main sabase mahatvapurn naam nazir akbarbaadi kaa he
 In his poems he broke the heart of the hearts of the Indian public by breaking with orthodox views
 unki style or vichaardhaara donon main bhartiya jivan kii saralata or udaartaa milti he
 As a result of western contact, in the mid-19th century, like other languages of India, a new consciousness started in Urdu and a new ideology emerged due to economic, social, and political changes
 kintu isse pehle dilli kii mitati hui saamanti sabhyataa ne zuk, momin, gaalib,, "shefta" or "zafar" jaise kaviyon ko janm diya
 Among them, especially Ghalib's literary works symbolize both the strengths and errors of that life
 unki mahatta isamen hai ki unhone apni kavitaaon main hardik bhaavon or maansik sthitiyon, donon kaa samanvay ek vicitra style main kiya he
 Urdu prose was developed before the new era, but it grew in the 19th century
 dakshin main "merajual aashiqin" or "sabaras" ke atirikt kuch dharmik rachanaayen milti hai
 In northern India, the name of "tehsin mursa" of "tehsin" can be derived
 angrejon ne apni suvidha ke liye fort wiliam kalege sthapit kiya or gadhy main kuch pustaken likhavai jiske falswaroop urdu gadhy kii us nai style k vikaas hua jo 50 varsh baad purnataya prachlit hui
 Among the compositions here are Mir Amman's "baghobhar" Hydari's "arishe Mahfil", Pity's "baghe Urdu" villa as "betal Pachisi", Jawan's "throne Battisi", Nihalchand's "mazhabhe Ishq", high quality compositions
 19veen sadi ke aarambh main hi "insha" ne "rani ketki kii kahani" ore "dariyaae latafat" likhi thim
 The most important and well-known book in fiction, "fissanay Ajayab" in Lucknow, was written in 1824 AD; Its author is Rajab Ali Baig "surur"
 angreji shiksha ke vistaar ke kaaran nae pathyakram ban rahe the
 For this, in 1842 AD, "vernacular" Translation Society "was established in Dehli College where in addition to Ramayana, Mahabharata, Lilavati, Dharmashastra etc
, about 150 books of various subjects were translated into Urdu
 is prakaar urdu gadhy bhi unnati karata rahaa or is yogya hua ki nai chetana kaa saath de sake
 The real signs of renaissance in Urdu literature are found only after the Revolt of 1857
 iske aitihaasik, raajnneetik or saamaajik kaaran spasht hai
 The new consciousness that arose from these reasons gave the new poets and litterateurs an opportunity to write in a new situation
 isamen sabase pehla naam sar saiyad kaa liya ja saktaa he
 Under his leadership, Hali, Azad Nazir Ahmed and Shibli composed great works in Urdu prose and poetry and took inspiration from British literature to make their literature compatible with the times
 moulana mohammad hossain azaad nai urdu kavita ke nirmaataa the
 He was influenced by European scholars and literature in his student life in Delhi College
 lahore main unhone shiksha vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke sahyog se "anjumane punjab" kii sthapana kii or 1867 i
 main uski ek sabha main vyaakhyaan dete hue unhone urdu kavita kii trutiyon kii ore dhyaan dilaate hue kaha ki kavita ko maanav jivan or prakruti ke sabhi angon par prakaash daalana chahie jo durbhagyavash abhi tak urdu kavita main nahin ho sakaa
 Instead of beating the old line, we should make the problems of the new environment a matter of contemplation and poetry
 inhen vichaaron ke falswaroop urdu kavita main nai shaayari kaa nirmaan hua or baad ke adhiktar mahaan kavi isi se prabhavit hue
 Many raids were opened, newspapers and magazines were coming out, the struggle of the new old was going on, so these people got great facility to reveal their new ideas and spread them
 isi yug main "sarshar", "sharar" or mirza rusavaa kaa naam bhi liya ja saktaa he, jinhone upanyaas sahitya main bahoomoolya vruddhi kii
 This era can be called an era of criticism in every way; History was testing its test of what was being written
 in mahaan lekhakon ne aalochana, niabandh, upanyaas, jeevani, kavita ke rup main jo kuch likhaa he vahi aaj ke nae sahitya kaa aadhaar he
 The greatness of this era is that litterateurs had become pioneers and leaders of neoclassicalism
 raajnneetik drushti se ye log krantikari nahin the, kintu inhen kii vichaardhaara ke baad ke lekhakon ko prerana di
 a sense of nationalism was born long before the turn of the 20th century, and a glimpse of this is also found in the works of these writers; But its entire development took place in the poems and writings of "iqbal", "chakbast", "premchand", etc
 yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki isi ke saath sahitya kii puraani paramparaayen bhi chal rahi thim or "amir", "daag", "jalaal" or duusare kavi bhi apni gajalon se padhanevaalon ko mohit kar rahe the
 In one way or the other, this stream is still going on
 is shatabdi ke ullekhneey kaviyon main "safi", durga sahay "surur", "saaqib", "mahashar", "azeez", "ravaan, "hasarat", "faani", "jigar", "asar" or lekhakon main hasan nizami, rashidul kheri, sulaiman nadvi, abdulahaq, rashid ahamed, masood hasan, moulana azaad or aabidausain hai
 In the current era, the boundaries of literature have expanded further and the authors of every thought are engaged in bringing Urdu literature at par with other literature in their own way
 kaviyon main "josh", "firaaq", "faiz", "majaaz", "hafij", "saagar", "mullah", "ravish", "sardaar", "jameel" or "azaad" ke naam ullekhneey hai, to gadhy main krishnachandra "ashk", husaini, "minto", haitullah, ismat, ahamed nadeem, khwaaja ahamed abbaas apana mahatv rakhte hai
 Criticism literature flourished in the 20th century
 isamen niyaaz, firaaq, jor, kaleem, majanun, surur, ehteshaam hossain, ejaz hossain, mumtaz hossain, ibaadat ityadi ne bahut si bahumoolya pustaken likhin
 In the 20th century, the fights of literary schools ended and literature was started on the basis of ideologies
 angreji sahitya or shiksha ke prabhaav se chhayavaadi kavita ko badhaava mila
 Then the spirit of democracy and nationalism gave birth to the progressive movement which started in 1936 and is still going on in some form or the other
 is bich main "marks" or "frid" ne bhi lekhakon ko bhinn-bhinn samoohon main baanta
 Some writers started writing poems in free verse too, but all such experiments have not been able to deepen their roots
 samakaleen urdu sahitya main nai kavyrachana prayogwaad, spashtvaad, pratikwaad or niruddeshyvaad se bahut prabhavit ho rahi he
 The new poem boycott all the values of life because the new poets consider social consciousness as a barrier to poetry
 iske atirikt nae kavi apane vyaktitv apane vyaktitv ko siddh karne ke liye bhashaa, vichaar, kala or sahitya ke sabhi niyamon ko todna aavashyak samajhate hai
 Some people also call this the idea of freedom of thought, but it has not been clear yet that the writers of the new poem are breaking their ties with all the traditions of literature and art on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are giving their ideology to Europe and America
 Some are trying to reconcile the ideology of philosophers, writers and poets
 yah aadhuniktaa urdu kahani or upanyaas ko bhi prabhavit kar rahi he
 What place will the new poem, story and novel get in the history of literature, nothing can be said at this time
 sansparsh prakram gandhakaml nirmaan kii vartmaan samay main prachlit vidhi he
 It is useful in the manufacture of high concentration acids
 is abhikriya main platinum kaa upyog utprerak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 But with this platinum, there is a rate of reacting impurities of arsenic, so nowadays vanadium oxide is used as a catalyst
 san 1831 main is prakram kaa patant britain ke sirka vyapaaree peregin philips ne kiya tha
 Apart from the production of high concentration sulfur, the feature of this process is that it also gives sulfur trioxide and olium
 wooler jhil jammu va kashmir rajya ke bandipora zile main sthit ek jhil he
 It is the largest freshwater lake in India
 yah jhelum nadi ke maarg main aati he or jhelum isamen pani daalati bhi he or phir aage nikaal bhi leti he
 According to the weather, the size of this lake varies greatly - its size varies between 30 km किमी to 260 km किमी
 apane bade akar ke kaaran is jhil main badi lehren aati hai
 In ancient times, 'mahapadma Deity' was the supremacy of this lake and this lake was called 'mahapadmasar' after his name

dl=ui a type of meaning defect in poetry paribhaasha:-acharya mammat ke anusaarakavy ke mukhya arth ke vidhaat tatv hi dosha he|acharya vishwanath prasad ne sahityadarpan main "rasapakarshaka dosha:" kahkar ras kaa aparksh karne waalo tatwon ko dosha bataaya he|dosha kaa vibhaajan:---dosha kaa vibhaajan karnaa tarksangat nahi he kavyprakash main 70 dosha bataae gayi he inhe praayah paanch dosha main vibhajit kiya gaya he:--1-pad dosha 2- padaansh dosha 3- vaakya dosha
 4- arth dosha 5- ras dosha Kshemendra, a disciple of Acharya Abhinavagupta in Indian Poetry, established a new theory by declaring the living or self-justifying element of Rasasiddha poetry in his work "justification-discussion", which is known as justification
 kshemendra kii is udbhaavna ke beej maharishi bharat ke naatyashaastra main bhi uplabdh hai, jinhone naatak main veshbhusha ke samuchit sannivesh kii baat kii he
 Later, even without using the word justification, Bhamah, Uddhat and Dandi seem to believe in the power of this element in a different way
 rudrat to "auchity" shabd kaa spasht prayog bhi karte hai
 But justification gave special importance to soundman Anandvardhan
 unke anusaar rasadosh kaa pradhan kaaran auchity kaa abhaav he
 Therefore, the poet must always take care of justification in poetry
 alankaar or gun kii yojana jab tak uchit nahin hogi, kavy chamatkaari nahin ho sakegaa
 While declaring this fact clear in his work, Ksmendra said, "without justification, neither ornament produces interest nor virtue
" " vakroktijivitkaar kuntak ne bhi kavy ke do pradhan gunon main ek auchity mana he, doosraa he saubhaahgya
 Virtually nothing is justification, the proper configuration of qualities, ornamentation, ritual, jargon, chhandrachana, divisional plan etc
, in accordance with the poet's motif
 is prakaar auchity siddhant kavy kii samagrata ko dhyaan main rakhkar sthapit udbhaavna he
 It is also said that sound, rasa, poetry translation, quality, ornamentation, manner and curvature all actually follow justification
 kathy tathaa shilp donon paraspar samaanuroop hone chahien, usee tarah kavy ke vibhinn avyavon main bhi auchity kaa dhyaan rakhana kavi ke liye aavashyak he
 Kshmendra declared this element as the soul of poetry and has considered 27 distinctions - is talika se spasht he ki auchity siddhant kavy ke bahirang tathaa antarang donon ko dhyaan main rakhkar pratishthapit samikshavidhi he

 Value chain or value chain analysis is a concept from business management first described and practiced by Michael Porter in 1985 in his best-selling, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance

 utpaada, kram main shrunkhlaa kii sabhi gatividhiyon se guzarate hai or prayek gatividhi par utpaada kuch mulya praapt karte hai
 The range of activities gives products more added value than the addition of the added value of all activities

 There are three methods of showing the scale on the map - kathanamak vadh Different viewer method iii) aalekhi yaa raikhik vidhi In this method, the scale is measured by speaking or saying words such as 1
 m = 1 meter or 1 inch = 2 miles, ie 1 cm on the map
 m a is equal to 1 meter of the far surface or 2 miles of 1 inch distance on the map
 yah sabase saral vadh he yak saadhaaran padhaa lakha yit bhi ise samaj kar dooray k gananaa kar saktaa he
 But the use of this method is limited, as this measurement can be read only in the country where the measure is run
 dashak bhan vadh :yah sanyaamak maapak he jasm maapak ek bhan ke pa m dashaya jaataa he
 The fraction of it cuts the distance of the map and the actual distance of each surface
 bhan ke ansh kaa maan hameshaa 1 ikai hota he jaise - ek maanach k dashak bhan 1 / 100, 000 he to maanach k ek ikai dharaatal k 100,000 ikai ke baraabar he
 This method has the maximum use because in any country from any decade there can be remote distances from the measurement system there
 aalekhi vadh : ise raikhak maapak bhi kehete ha
 In this, the unit is cut in a straight line by dividing it into primary and secondary part and writing unit number
 is maapni ke maanach ke vavadhan evam laghukaran yaa m maapak bhi vat: parwatat ho jaataa he
 The graphical scale consists of five types
 saadhaaran maapak tulanaamak maapak kanavat maapak vanayar maapak evam ay maapak
 In the method of measurement, mutual change is called the measurement of measurement which is done as follows

 Assuming in units, the denominator is written and converted into a larger unit of the same scale as 1: 100 by 1 cm

 The second phase of the iron ore steel making process is steelmaking
 kachche lohe se ispaat banane ke liye kachche lohe main upasthit atirikt carbon tathaa gandhak, phosphorus aadi ashuddhiyon ko nikaala jaataa he or maiganej, nickel, chromium tathaa vanadium aadi tatv milaaye jate hai taaki vaanchit prakaar kaa ispaat banaaya ja sake
 The history of steel production is about four thousand years old
 antolia ke utkhanan se kuch ispaat ke saamaan mili hai
 Talking about the continent of Asia, there has been evidence of high-volume steel in Sri Lanka in three hundred years BC
 srilanka ne ispaat nirmaan ke liye hi vaayu-bhatti kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The iron pillar of Delhi is a living testimony to the antiquity and excellence of Indian steel making

 Iron is not found in an independent state in the womb of the earth, rather it is found in a compound state with oxygen and sulfur
 mul rup se louhe ke do ayask hote hai- hematite or pirit 
 Iron is extracted from hematite, separating oxygen
 louh ayask se lohe ko alag karnaa louh nishkarshan kehalaata he
 Iron is melted in the presence of carbon in iron extraction
 is kriya ko pragalan kehete hai
 Initially, low melting point metals were smelted
 tambe kaa galnaank 1000 degree celcysius he, jabaki tin 250 degree celsius par pigal jaataa he
 The melting point of cast iron is 1370 ° C
 800 degree celsius ke baad oxikaran dar teji se bad jaataa he
 This is why smelting is carried out in low-oxygen environments
 tambe or tin ke vipareet, carbon tarah lohe main aasaani se ghul jaataa he
 In this way steel is made by mixing carbon in iron
 ayask se adhik se adhik dhaatu praapt karne ke liye avkaarak vastu, carbon, bahutayat se milaai jaati he
 The carbon is subsequently removed to the desired volume by oxidation
 isse saath ke duusare tatwon kaa bhi, jinka avkaran hua rahata he or jo oxikaraniya hote hai, oxikaran ho jaataa he
 It is to be noted here that a little manipulation of carbon in iron causes a big change in the quality of the steel
 ispaat ke gunon main vaanchit badlaav ke liye louhe or carbon ke mishran main duusare padaarth bhi milaae jate hai
 Nickel and manganese are added to the steel to increase its tensile strength
 kathorta badhaane ke liye chromium or venedium kaa mishran kiya jaataa he
 In metallurgical practice, the term "pure metal" is also used for a metal of trade mixtures which primarily have the same properties as a pure chemical metal
 inamen shesh jo ashuddhta hoti he yaa to use dur karnaa kathin hota he, athwa dhaatu main koi vishesh gun praapt karne ke liye use jaan boojhkar milaayaa jaataa he
 The elements thus mixed are called 'alloying elements'
 pracheen kaal main ispaat utpaadan kii do vidhiyaan prachlit thim
 The famous 'wuts' steel of India was made by these methods
 carbadhishoshan vidhi main pitwaan lohe ko coke ke sampark main rakhkar paryaapt samay tak ucch taap par garam kiya jaataa he
 The characters in which this action is done are called transformation characters and they are made of stone stools
 in paatro ko carbadhishoshan bhatthiyon kiya jaataa he
 In order to prevent the entry of air into the vessel, they are well sealed with fire materials, otherwise the effect of air will cause coal to burn to ashes and iron will be oxidized
 paatr ko lagabhaag 48 ghante main 1,000° sein
 tak garam kiya jaataa he
 Keep this temperature stable for seven to nine days
 is kriya ke parinaam swaroop koyale kaa carbon lohe main pravisht ho jaataa he
 When the carbon reaches sufficient depth the characters are cooled slowly for a period of one week
 is prakaar jo chaden nikalati hai unki sataha par fafole dikhaai dete hai
 Therefore they are called 'blister steel'
 is ispaat ko garam karke pitayee kii jaati he jisase yah samras ho jaae
 Even after beating steel, it has minimal unevenness
 is ispaat ko ghadiya main dravit karke usak rasinic sanghatan ek sa kar liya jaataa he
 Carbidification is also liberated from the sintered particles present in steel by this action
 is kaary ke liye adhiktar 50 pound dharitavali graphite kii ghadiyaan prayukt kii jaati hai
 These clocks are heated in coke kilns by placing carbodispersion steel
 ghadiya vidhi main dhaatu kaa parishkar nahin hota, isliye iske liye upyukt prabhaar yathasambhav shuddh hona chahie
 Earlier, high quality tool steel was made by this method
 ispaat-nirmaan main asli kranti 1850 ke dashak ke antim dinon main aayi
 The Basmer method was the first successful method by which large quantities of steel could be produced
 iske baad khulaa chulhaa vidhi aayi
 Modern steelmaking can be divided into two parts - primary and secondary steelmaking
 praathmik ispaat nirmaan use kehete hai jisamen ispaat-nirmaan ke liye adhikanshtah vatya bhatthi se nikle naye lohe kaa upyog kiya jaay
 Secondary steel fabrication is that in which brittle or scrap steel is used for steel making
 ispatnirmaan ke samay nikaleen gaison kaa upyog urja ke strot ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1856, Henry Bessemer revolutionized the methods of steel production
 is vidhi main nashpati main jise 'besimar parivertiddh' kehete he, dravit kachche lohe main dhaunkani se vaayu pravaahit kii jaati he
 Oxidation of impurities present in liquefied iron is by oxygen of air
 ye kriyaayein ooshmaakshepak hoti hai, isliye is vidhi main bahya idhan kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 The impurities present in iron are oxidized to form sintered and the remaining iron takes the form of steel
 besimar parivartitra kaa vahya bhaag ispaat patt se bana hota he tath andar kii ore ooshmasah padaarthon ke astr die jate hai
 There are two methods under the Bessemer method: acidic and coaxial
 in paddatiyon kaa upyog kachche lohe ke gunon par nirbhar karata he
 If cast iron has a high amount of phosphorus, coaxial method is used
 jahaan phosphorus ke niraakaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti vahaan amleey paddati vyavahrut kii jaati he
 The lining of thermodynamic materials inside the Bessemer converter depends on the method used
 amleey paddati main adhiktar silikamay padaarth upyog main aate hai jabaki samaakshareey paddati main samaakshareey padaarth, jaise dolomite, hi upyog main laae jate hai
 The air of the Bessemer converter consists of air springs, through which the air blows on the high flame in the liquefied iron
 ucch daab isliye aavashyak he ki dhaman kaal main drav loha tonti ke dwaara parivartittra ke vayudhan main na chalaa jaae
 The main impurities in the acidic system are silicon, manganese, and carbon
 inke oxikaran main lagbhag 12 minute lagate hai
 First silicones and manganese are oxidized and they form clinker
 phir carbon oxikrut hokar carbon monoksaide gas banaata he, jo parivartitra ke munh par prajvalit hokar vishaal jwaala utpann karata he
 After this action, the finished steel is named after the changer vessel is pulled out in the tail
 phir aavashyaktaanusaar isamen pun: carburikaarak tathaa vioxikaran daalkar ispaat ko aichhik rasinic sanghatan kaa banaaya jaataa he
 All actions in the axillary system are similar to the acidic method, but it takes an additional time of 5-6 minutes to oxidize phosphorus
 silicon, manganeez, tathaa carbon ke kramik oxikaran ke pashchaat hi phosphorus oxikrut hota he or paatr main vidyaman chooney ke saath milakar samaakshareey dhaatumal banaata he
 Only after separating this slag, carburetic and deoxidizer are added to the metal again
 ise 'basic oxygen vidhi' bhi kehete hai
 In 1851, the Linz and Donavitz metallologists of Austria discovered a converged form of the Bessemer method, named after them L
W
 D
 method is called
 isamen parivartitra paatr main dravit lohe kii sataha par shuddh oxigen pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 By this method, the oxidation of impurities is quickly achieved and nitrogen-free steel is obtained
 aaj vishwa kaa lagbhag 75 pratishat ispaat utpaadan khuli chulli bhatthi vidhi se kiya jaataa he
 An open furnace is used for this work
 besimar vidhi kii tarah hi isamen bhi amleey tathaa samaakshareey roopantaran hote hai
 The use of these methods depends on the chemical composition of the raw material
 yahan yah samaran rakhana aavashyak he ki khuli chulli bhatthi kii ispaat utpaadan vidhi main dhaatumal kii banaavat par hi ispaat kaa gun nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, special attention is paid to the preparation of clinker in this method
 yadi samaakshareey dhaatumal taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, to 'samaakshareey khulli chulli bhatthi paddati' kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or yadi amleey mel kii aavashyaktaa hoti he to 'amleey vidhi' kaa upyog hota he
 The open chullibatti holds only 25 to 300 tons capacity
 bade bhrashtron kaa chullital 15 foot chaudaa, 40 foot lanbaa tathaa 20 inch gaharaa hota he
 Chullital is made up of various thermodynamic substances
 amleey paddati main amleey ooshmasah tathaa samaakshareey paddati main samaakshareey ooshmasah padaarth prayukt hote hai
 The walls and roof of the country are generally made of silica bricks
 aajkal chat ke liye magnesite iton kaa bhi upyog hone laga he
 On either side below the chullital there are two chambers made of heat-resistant bricks, called 'regenerators'
 bhrashtra se bahirgami dahan-utpaada ek ore ke donon punarzanitron main se hokar guzarate hai or is prakaar apni gyey ooshmaa rodhakon ko pradaan karte hai
 After some time, the combustible gas and air in the furnace are sent through these heated insulators, from which they receive heat from the insulators and then the combustion product passes through the regenerators on the other side
 yah kriya 15-20 minute ke antar par duharai jaati he
 Through this system, the furnace is sent through two separate routes built on either side of the air chull, required for fuel and combustion
 in margon ko port kehete hai
 There are usually five charge gates to fill the charge in large furnaces
 dravit dhaatu tathaa mel ke nikalne ke liye bhatthiyon kii pichhali deevaaron main 'tonti chhidr hote hai
 Gaseous or liquid fuels are used to heat these furnaces
 khulli chulli bhatthi main ispaat utpaadan ke liye kachche maal ke rup main loha, raddi maal athwa donon kaa mishran upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 After the furnace charge, the charge is allowed to liquefy
 dhaatu ke parishkar ke liye gaalkon kaa upyog hota he, jinamein pathar tathaa loh ayask pramukh hai
 Oxygen exposure of iron ore sequentially oxidizes impurities such as silicon, manganese, and phosphorus and makes them sludge
 tatpashchaat lohe ke carbon kaa oxikaran hota he, jo chooney main budbudaahat utpann hone ke kaal main apni charam seemaa par pahunch jaataa he
 When the chemical composition of the metal reaches the desired point, it is removed in the tail
 vahaan par pun: carburikaarak tathaa viaksikaarak daalaa ja saktaa he
 They store this steel as a mass
 bahudhaa amleey bencemer vidhi ke saath samaakshareey khuli chulli bhatthi vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This is called the duplex method
 jab amleey besimar tathaa samaakshareey evam amleey khuli chulli bhatthi vidhiyon kaa upyog hota he to use trik yaa triplex, vidhi kehete hai
 There are mainly two types of electric furnaces used in steel production: chaap bhatthi main graphite vidyudagron, athwa vidyudagr or dhaatu, ke bich vidyucchap banataa he, jisase tej ooshmaa nikalati he or dhaatu kaa pragalan karti he
 The induction blocks the flow of metal-induced electromagnetism in the furnace, producing heat
 bade pariman main ispaat utpaadan ke liye chaap bhatthi hi adhik upyogi he or isaki dharita ek ton se lekar 100 ton tak hi hoti he
 Induction furnace is mainly used in the production of tools or special types of steel
 chaap bhatthi main vidyudagron or dhaatu ke bich chaap utpann karke dhaatu kaa galan hota he
 The refinement process begins after melting, which depends on a lot of charge
 yadi prabhaar main adhikansh raddi maal he, to keval vioxikaran kii aavashyaktaa padati he or phir carbonikaran ityadi darvi main kiya ja saktaa he
 The smelting process is mainly carried out in the induction furnace and there is no refinement possible

 RFID has many applications, for example, it is used in enterprise supply chain management to improve inventory tracking and improve management efficiency
 1945 main leone theramin ne soviet sangh ke liye ek jasusi upkaran kaa avishkaar kiya jo shravy jaankaree ke saath ghatana radio tarangon ko punah sanchaarit karata tha
 The sound waves vibrated a diaphragm that slightly changed the shape of the resonator, modulating the reflected radio frequency
 yadhyapi yah upkaran ek gupt shravy upkaran tha, naa ki ek pahchaan tag, ise RFID praudyogiki kaa ek purvavarti mana jaataa he, kyonki yah bhi vaise hi niskriy tha, jo ek bahya strot se vidyutchumbakeey tarangon dwaara shaktishaalee or sakriy ho jaataa tha

 wal-mart or america raksha vibhaag ne un aavashyaktaaon ko prakashit kiya he jo unke vikritaon ne aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan main sudhaar ke liye ladaan par RFID tag par lagaaya he
 Due to the size of these two organizations, their RFID mandate affects thousands of companies worldwide
 samay seemaa ko kai baar badhaayaa gaya he kyonki kai vikreta RFID pranali ko lagu karne main mahatvapurn kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karte hai
 In practice, currently successful reading rates run only 80%, due to radio wave attenuation caused by products and packaging
 bhavishya main yah aashaa kii jaati he ki choti companiyaan bhi baahar jane vaale apane ladaan par RFID tag lagane main sakasham hongi
 In January 2005, wal-mart made it mandatory for its top 100 suppliers to label rfids on all shipments
 is aavashyaktaa ko puraa karne ke liye, vikritaon ne dabbon or pallate par jisamen wal-mart ke liye EPC tag kii aavashyaktaa thi, label lagane ke liye RFID printer / incoder kaa upyog kiya
 These smart labels are created by rooting the RFID inlays inside the material and then printing the bar code and other visible information on the label surface

 Two years later, the Wall Street Journal published an article titled "wal-marts radio-tracked Inventory Hits Static"
 lekh ne kaha ki wal-mart dwaara ullikhit RFID yojana "asafalataa ke lakshan dikhaa rahi he" jiskaa kaaran he wal-mart ke adhikariyon dwaara is praudyogiki ko apni dukaanon par prarambh karne main or aapurtikartaaon ke liye astitvaheen protsaahanon ko shuru karne main asafalataa
 In October 2007, wal-mart announced a new core area for RFID implementation
 wal-mart kaa ek or prabhag, sams club bhi is disha main aage aayaa he
 On January 7, 2008, it sent a letter to its suppliers stating that from January 31, 2008, each complete single-item palette could be sent to its distribution centers in Desoto, Texas, or directly to one of its stores serviced by that DC However, it is necessary to have an EPC Gen 2 RFID tag on it
 iskaa paalan karne main naakaam rahane vaale aapurtikarta ko seva shulk dena hoga
 However, in January 2009, Sam's Club significantly reduced non-compliance fines, which it reduced from $ 2 per palette to just 12 cents per palette
 wal-mart kaa anumaan he ki sams ke liye khud tanging karne par prati pallate 12 saint kaa kharchaa aayega
 Symes also announced that palette-level tagging is expected to be rolled out throughout the series in 2010, while the timeframe for tagging on individual items is "under consideration"
 farvari 2009 main, proctor and gambal ne vipanan or prachaar pradarshan main RFID kaarykram ke laabh kii "pushti" karne ke baad kaha ki vah wal-mart ke saath apane prachaar kaarykram ko samaapt kar rahaa he
 This meant that wal-mart was not working on improving the store's performance on this information

 However, retailers typically engage in forward buying and tend to buy more products during the discount period than they intended to sell during the promotional period
 kuch khudara vikreta ek prakaar ke antarpanan main sanlagn ho jate hai or riyayati utpaada ko anya khudara vikritaon ko bechney lag jate hai, is abhyaas ko diverting ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 To counter this practice, manufacturers are exploring the possibility of using RFID tags on promoted merchandise to track exactly which products have been sold through the supply chain at completely discounted prices
 RFID praudyogiki ke kai upyogon main se ek he unka pustakaalayon main prayog
 This technology has gradually started replacing traditional barcodes on library items
 RFID tag main pahchaan sambandhit jaankaree ho sakati he jaise ek pustak kaa sheershak yaa saamagree prakaar, jiske tahat ek alag databes kii ore ishaara karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi 
 This information is read by an RFID reader, which replaces the standard barcode reader commonly found on the circulation table of a library
 pustkaalay saamagree par paaya jane vaala RFID tag aamtaur par uttar america main 50 mm x 50 mm or europe main 50 mm x 75 mm ke naap kaa hota he
 It can be replaced or incorporated into barcodes, which will provide staff with a different method of inventory management and service to the takers themselves
 yah ek suraksha upkaran ke rup main bhi kaary kar sakate hai or paramparaagat vidyut chumbakeey pattee kii jagah le sakate hai or na keval kitaaben, balki sadsyta card main bhi ek RFID tag lagaaya ja saktaa he
 However, there is debate as to when and where rfids first started in libraries, it was first proposed in the 1990s as a technology to increase workflow in library settings
 pustakaalayon main sarvapratham RFID shuru karne waalon main nishchit rup se singapore he or neuyork main rockfilor vishvavidhyalay is takanic kaa upyog karne vaala sanyukt rajya america main pehla shaikshanik pustkaalay he, jabaki michigan main Farmington Community Library is takanic kaa upyog karne vaali pehali saarvajanik sanstha he, donon ne 1999 main RFID kaa upyog shuru kiya
 In Europe, the first public library to use RFID is in hogejund-sapheimer in the Netherlands, where in 2001 an option was given to collectors
 unhen aashcharyachakit karte hue, bujurg logon sahit 70% ne RFID vikalp kaa prayog kiya or jaldi hi anukulit ho gaye
 In absolute numbers worldwide, RFID is the most used in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom and Japan
 anumaan he ki duniya bhar main 30 million se adhik pustkaalay samagriyon par ab RFID tag laga he jisamen rome main vatican librari main kuch shaamil hai
 RFID has many library applications that can be highly beneficial, especially to circulation employees
 chunki RFID tag ko kisi vastu ke andar se bhi padhaa ja saktaa he, kisi saamagree ko scan karne ke liye kisi kitaab ke aavaran yaa DVD ke khol ko kholane kii jarurat nahin he
 This can reduce repetitive motion injuries
 jahaan pustakon ke upar ek barcode he, vahaan abhi bhi yah suvidha he ki lenevaale ek kitaab ko ek baar main karne kii bajaae, pustakon ke ek puure dher ko ek baar main scan kar sakate hai
 Since RFID tags can also be read in motion, using an RFID reader to check the returned material on the conveyor belt saves employee time
 lekin, jaisaa ki barcode ke saath he, yah sabhi lenevaalon ke dwaara swayan hi kiya ja saktaa he jiskaa arth hua ki unhen phir kabhi karmchaariyon kii sahaayta kii jarurat naa ho
 In addition to these fixed location readers, there are portable readers
 in sab ke saath, vastusuchee ko kuch second ke bheetar, saamagree ke ek puure shelf par kiya ja sakegaa, jiske tahat ek bhi pustak ko aalmaari se hataanaa nahin padegaa

 In Umeå, Sweden, RFID is used to obtain audio books for the blind
 malaysia main, multimedia uniwarsity librari, sibarajaya main pustakon kaa sateek sthaan ingit karne ke liye smart shelvs kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In the Netherlands, hand held readers have been started for this purpose
 saarvajanik pustkaalay kaa dach sangh ek anyonyakriya 'sandarbh pustkaalay' kii avadharana par kaam kar rahaa he, jahaan lenevaalon ko ek reader / headphone set miltaa he, jo unhen pustkaalay ke vaanchit anubhag kii ore le jaataa he or jiskaa istamaal ve almariyon par rakhi pustakon se vaanchit str ke vivaran ke saath soochna padhane ke liye kar sakate hai jo pustak ke tag se hi aata he yaa kahin or sthit database se or lenevaale kii variyataon ke aadhaar par vikalp kaa suzav praapt karke, is prakaar pustkaalay kaa or adhik vyaktigat sanskaran banaaya ja saktaa he
 With this they will also go to those parts of the library where otherwise they do not travel
 lenevaale, is pranali kaa upyog anubhavon ke aadan-pradaan ke liye bhi kar sakate hai 
 It is already being done by children in the virtual realm in mijnstempel
nl, but it can also be done in physical form
 lenevaale, vaapasi mez par kitaab ko grad de sakate hai
 But, as of 2008, this technique is very expensive for many small libraries and the conversion period for an average-sized library is estimated at 11 months
 2004 kaa ek dach anumaan tha ki ek pustkaalay jo prati varsh 100,000 kitaaben padaan karata he use €50,000 kii laagat par yojana banani chahie 
 Reducing a large burden on staff by RFID means that fewer staff are needed, resulting in the removal of some of them, but this has not yet happened in North America where recent surveys have not found a single library Where the employee has been removed due to RFID
 balki, karmiyon ke liye pustkaalay bajet kam kiya ja rahaa he or buniyadi suvidhaon ke liye badhaayaa ja rahaa he, jisase pustakaalayon ke liye yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki ve karmchaariyon kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye swachaalan ko badhayen
 Furthermore, the functions performed by RFID are largely not the primary function of the librarian
 netherland main ek khoj yah he ki, lenevaale is tathy se khush hai ki ab sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke liye or adhik karmchaaree uplabdh hai
 The concern regarding RFID in libraries is the issue of privacy
 chunki RFID transmeter or reader ke anusaar, RFID tag ko 350 feet yaa 100 meter se padhaa or scan kiya ja saktaa he or chunki RFID, frequency ke vargeekaran kaa istemaal karata he, chintaa kaa vishay yah he ki kya samvedansheel jaankaree ko ek anicchhuk strot se ekatra kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the library's RFID tag does not include any patron information, and the frequency the tag uses in most libraries is only readable by about ten feet
 saath hi, pustakaalayon ko hameshaa yah record rakhana he ki kisne kab kya liya he, to us myne main koi nai baat nahin he
 However, many libraries destroy these records once the material is returned
 RFID, pathakon kii gopneeyata ke is sammaan ko jatil yaa samaapt kar degi
 In addition, another non-library agency may record the RFID tag of each person leaving the library, possibly without the knowledge or consent of the library administrator
 ek aasaan vikalp he ki pustak ko ek code sanchaarit karne diya jaae jiskaa mahatv sirf librari ke databes ke saath sangyojan ke rup main ho
 Another step is to give the book a new code whenever it is returned
 or agar bhavishya main reader sarvavyaapak ho jaae to, chori gai kitabon ko librari ke baahar bhi pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The removal of the tag can be made difficult if the tag is small enough to be invisibly placed inside a page, possibly put there by the publisher
 90 ke dashak ke aarambhik varshon main vibhinn jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke prayog main safalataa ne vibhinn maanav trekking vikalpon main RFID anusandhan ko prerit kiya he
 The first RFID passports were issued by Malaysia in 1998

 The ICAO refers to the ISO / IEC 14443 RFID chip in e-passport as a "contactless integrated circuit"
 ICAO maanak, i-passport ko pahchaanane ke liye saamne ke aavaran par ek maanak i-passport logo uplabdh karaate hai
 In 2006 the RFID tag was included in the new US passport
 america ne 2005 main 10 million passport kaa utpaadan kiya or anumaan he ki 2006 main 13 million kaa utpaadan kiya jayega
 The inlay work of chips manufactured by Smartrack will preserve the same information as printed in the passport and will also include a digital photograph of the owner
 america videsh vibhaag ne shuru main kaha ki chips ko keval 10 semi kii duuri se padhaa ja sakegaa, lekin vyapak aalochana or spasht pradarshan ke baad yah vishesh upkaran pareekshan passport ko 10 meter kii duuri se pard saktaa he, in passport kii dizine main dhaatu kaa ek astr he jo anaadhikrut pathakon ke liye isamen se jaankaree "khinchne" ko adhik kathin banaata he jab passport band ho
 The department will also implement basic access control which will act as a personal identification number in the form of letters printed on the passport data page
 ek passport tag ko padhe jane se pehle, is pin ko ek RFID reader main darj karnaa hoga
 The BAC enables encryption of any communication between the chip and the interrogator
 suraksha visheshgy bruce shnair ne suzav diya he ki ek hawaii adde ke nikat sanchaalan karata ek luteraa amir deshon se aane waalon ko shikaar bana saktaa he, yaa ek aatankwaadi ek taatkaalik visphotak upkaran dizin kar saktaa he jo tab kaary karegaa jab kisi vishesh desh ke vyakti dwaara sampark kiya jaae yadi yatri apana card apane sharir ke najadik yaa ek foile-lind batue main nahin rakhte

 It is possible that active or semi-passive RFID tags used in place of barcodes may transmit a signal to an in-store receiver to determine whether the RFID tag is in store
 july, 2004 main, america ke khaadya evam aushadhi prashasan ne ek aadesh jari kiya jo aavashyak rup se ek antim samiksha kii prakriya shuru karata he jo tay karegaa ki kya aspataalon main rogiyon kii pahchaan karne or / yaa sambandhit aspataal ke staff ko medical record kaa upyog karne kii anumati dene ke liye RFID pranali kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Since then, many RF hospitals have implanted an RFID tag in patients in the US and have typically begun using the RFID system for workflow and inventory management
 kuch aise saboot bhi hai ki aspataalon main RFID pranali ke karyanvayan ke parinamswaroop nurse or aspataal ke anya karmchaariyon kii gatividhiyon par adhik nigaraanee rakhi ja sakati he
 IVF clinics are considering the use of RFID to prevent mingling between sperm and eggs
 oktober 2004 main, FDA ne maanav main pratyaropit kiye ja sakane vaale america ke pehle RFID chip ko manjuuri di
 verichip Corporation's 134 khz RFID chips can hold personal medical information and, according to the company, can be lifesaving in the case of errors in medical treatment and limiting injuries
 FDA anumodan ko niveshkon ke saath ek sammelan ke dauraan bataaya gaya
 Shortly after approval, authors and anti-rfid activists Catherine Albrecht and Liz mcintire discovered a warning letter from the FDA that wrote about serious health risks associated with the verichip
 FDA ke mutabik, inamen shaamil hai "pratikul utak pratikriya", "pratyaropit transponder kaa sthaan parivartan", "pratyaropit transponder kii vifaltaa","bijli ke khatre" or "magnetic rejonence imaging asangati

 They chose cybra's edgemagic RFID and bar code software to take this process forward
 koi vaishvik saarvajanik sanstha nahin he jo RFID ke liye prayukt frequency ko niyantrit karti he
 In principle, every country can set its own rules for this
 RFID ke liye frequency aavanton ko niyantrit karne vaale mukhya nikaay hai: Low-frequency tags and high-frequency tags can be used globally without a license
 ultra hai-frequency tag ko duniya bhar main istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa he kyonki koi bhi vaishvik maanak nahin he
 In North America, UHF can be used unlicensed for 902-928 & mhz, but there are restrictions on transmission rights
 europe main, RFID or anya kam-kshamta vidyut radio anuprayog, ETSI kii siforeeshon EN 300 220 or EN 302 208 or ERO 70 03 sifarish dwaara viniyamit hai, jo RFID ko 865-868 megahertj ke kuch jatil band pratibandhon ke saath sanchaalan kii anumati dete hai
 Readers need to monitor a channel before broadcasting; This requirement imposes little restriction on performance, the resolution of which is the subject of existing research
 uttar america UHF maanak, france main sweekaar nahin kiye jate hai chunki ye uske sainya band ke saath hastkshep karte hai
 For China and Japan, there are no rules for using UHF
 in deshon main har UHF ke aavedan ke liye ek site license kii zarurat he, jiskaa aavedan sthaneey adhikariyon ke paas kiya janaa chahie or ise radd kiya ja saktaa he
 918–926 mhz are unlicensed for Australia and New Zealand, but restrictions exist for transmission rights
 ye frequencys ISM band ke rup main jaani jaati hai 
 The return signal of the tag may also interfere with other radio users
 RFID praudyogiki ke sambandh main banaae gaye kuch maanakon main shaamil hai: EPC Gen2 is short for epcglobal UHF Class 1 Generation 2
 epcglobal, duniya bhar main companiyon ke liye aapurti shrinkhalaa main kai madon kii pahchaan main zyaadaatar niskriy RFID or EPC ke upyog ke liye antarrashtriya maanak par kaam kar rahi he
 One of epcglobal's campaigns was to simplify the rift of protocols prevalent in the RFID world in the 1990s
 do tag air interphes ko epcglobal dwaara 2003 se pehle paribhaashit kiya gaya
 These protocols, commonly known as Class 0 and Class 1, underwent significant commercial implementation in 2002–2005
 2004 main hardware ection group ne ek nae protocol, class 1 janareshan 2 interphes nirmit kiya jisane kai samasyaon ko suljhaayaa jiskaa anubhav class 0 tathaa class 1 ke saath kiya gaya tha
 The EPC Gen2 standard was approved in December 2004 and is expected to form the basis of the moving passive RFID tag standards
 ise Intermec se ek vivaad ke baad ki is maanak se unke rfid-sambandhit kai patent kaa ulanghan ho saktaa he, manjuuri di gai
 It was decided that not just the standard is infringing on their patent, but that Intermec may have to pay some royalties if the tag is to be read in a particular way
 EPC Gen2 maanak ko ISO 18000-6C ke rup main maamuli sanshodhano ke saath 2006 main apanaaya gaya
 The lowest cost of Gen2 EPC inlays by smartcode is $ 0

 Furthermore, no emerging standard has yet become as widespread as barcodes
 RFID suraksha ko lekar ek praathmik chintaa RFID tag kii avaidh trekking he
 Tags, which are globally readable, pose a threat to both private space privacy and corporate / military security
 is tarah kii chintaaen, america raksha vibhaag dwaara haal main aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan ke liye RFID tag ko apnaane se uthaai gai hai
 Generally, privacy organizations have expressed concern in the context of ongoing efforts to incorporate electronic product code RFID tags into consumer products
 dizin ke aadhaar par, epcglobal Network bhi Dos hamalon ke prati kamazor he
 In using a similar system with DNS to resolve EPC data requests, ONS root servers become vulnerable to dos attacks
 epcglobal Network ke saath shuruyaat karne kii yojana bana rahaa koi bhi sanghathan yah gyaat hone par thithur jayega ki epcglobal Network ke buniyadi dhaanche main DNS ke samaan hi suraksha kamajoriyaan hai
 a second class of defense uses cryptography to prevent tag cloning
 kuch tag ek prakaar ke "rolling code" yojana kaa upyog karte hai, jisamen tag pahachanakarta jaankaree prayek scan ke baad parivartit ho jaati he, is tarah dekhi gai pratikriyaaon kii upyogita ko kam kar detii he
 More sophisticated tools engage in challenge-response authentication where the tag interacts with the reader
 in protocol main, tag or reader ke bich asurakshit sanchaar channel par gupt tag jaankaree nahin bheji jaati he
 Rather, the reader issues a challenge to the tag, which answers with a result that is calculated using cryptographic circuits tied to some latent value
 aise protocol, samamit yaa saarvajanik kunjee kryptography par aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 a code-enabled tag is usually dramatically higher in price and requires more power than the simpler counterpart and as a result the deployment of these tags is more limited
 is laagat / vidyut bandhan ne kuch nirmaataaon ko kaaphi kamjor yaa swaamitv vaali ancripshan yojanaon kaa upyog karke kutlekhith tag lagane main prerit kiya, jo parishkrut hamale ko aavashyak rup se nahin rokte
 exxon-mobil Speedpass, for example, uses a cryptographic-enabled tag created by Texas Instruments, called Digital Signature Transponder, which includes a weak, proprietary encryption scheme to perform a challenge-response protocol for low cost is
 phir bhi anya kutlekhith protocol, anadhikrut pathakon ke khilaaf gopneeyata hasil karne ke prayaas main hai, haalanki ye protocol abhi anusandhan charan main hai
 a major challenge in securing RFID tags is the lack of computational resources within the tag

 Ars Technica reported an RFID buffer overflow bug in March 2006 that could infect the airport terminal RFID database for baggage and also the passport database to obtain passport holder's confidential information
 passport ko adhik surakshit banane ke prayaas main kai deshon ne passport main RFID lagu kiya he
 However, encryption on UK chips was broken within 48 hours
 us ghatana ke baad se or adhik prayaas ne shodhakartaaon ko, jab passport ko uske maalik ke paas bheja ja rahaa ho us vakt passport data ko clon karne kii anumati di
 Where an offender was required to secretly open and close the envelope, it can now be done without being detected, leading to some insecurity in the passport system
 bazaar main aise kai utpaada uplabdh hai jo RFID sakasham card yaa passport ke sambandhit vaahak ko apane data ke parirakshan kii anumati denge
 Rather now, the United States government has made it necessary for its new employee ID card to be shipped with an approved shielding sleeve or envelope
 is baat ko lekar virodhabhasi vichaar vyaapt hai ki kya aluminium RFID chip ke padhane ko roak saktaa he
 Some claim that aluminum shielding, which originally built a Faraday cage, works perfectly
 dusron kaa daawa he ki aluminium panni main ek RFID card ko sirf lapetane se keval prasaaran main or adhik baadha aati he, isliye puri tarah se ise rokane main kargar nahin he
 Shielding is then a function of the frequency being used
 lo frequesnci lowfid tag, jaise jo manushya or paaltu jaanwaron ke liye pratyaropan yogya upkarnon main istemaal hote hai, parirakshan ke prati apekshaakrit pratirodhi hai, haalanki mote dhaatu kii panni adhikansh pathan ko rokegi
 High frequency highfid tags are sensitive to shielding and are difficult to read when they are within a few centimeters of a metal surface
 UHF ultra-highfid tag ko padhanaa kathin he jab unhen kisi dhaatu kii sataha ke kuch millimetre ke bheetar rakhaa jaae, haalanki unki pathan seemaa vastav main bad jaati he jab unhen kisi dhaatu se 2–4 cm par rakhaa jaataa he or iskaa kaaran he tag par pratibimbit tarang or insident tarang kaa sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran
 UHFID tags can be successfully shielded from most reads by placing them inside an anti-static plastic bag
 RFID praudyogiki ke upyog ne kaaphi vivaad ko janm diya or yahaan tak ki upabhokta gopneeyata pairokaron dwaara utpaada bahishkaar bhi hua
 CASPIAN co-founders Catherine Albrecht and Liz mcintire are two of the most critical critics of the technology, referring to RFID tags as "spychips"
 RFID sambandhit do mukhya gopneeyata chintaaen hai: Most concerns revolve around the fact that RFID tags sticking to products remain active even after the product is purchased and taken home, and thus can be used for purposes unrelated to monitoring and supply chain inventory operations
 uparokt dwaara uthaai gai chintaaon ko clip tag ke prayog dwaara aanshik rup se khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 The clipped tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy
 clip tag kaa suzav IBM shodhakartaaon, paul moscovitz or guentar karjoth dwaara diya gaya he
 After the sale, the consumer can uproot a portion of the tag
 isse ek lambii duuri ke tag ko ek najdiki tag main parivartan kii anumati milti he jise ab bhi padhaa ja saktaa he, lekin sirf kam duuri par - kuch inch yaa centimetre se bhi kam main
 This modification of the tag can be confirmed by eye
 is tag kaa upyog baad main vaapasi, yaad dilaane, yaa ricycling ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The reading range, however, is a function of both the reader and the tag
 praudyogiki ke kshetra main sudhaar se tag kii pathan seemaa main vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 Being too close to the reader's tag makes short-range tags readable
 aam taur par, ek tag kii pathan seemaa ko reader se utani duuri par simit kiya jaataa he jis par tag, reader kshetra se tag ko niyantrit karne ke liye paryaapt urja khinch sake
 By increasing the power of a reader, tags can be read from a distance greater than the distance assigned to them
 pathan duuri par seemaa, tab reader ko tag se waapas bheje gaye sanket kaa signal-tu-nauez anupaat ban jaataa he
 Researchers at two security conferences showed that passive ultra-highfid tags, not the type of highfid used in US passports that are typically read up to 30 feet, can be read from 50–69 feet using appropriate equipment
 janvari 2004 main, CASPIAN ke gopneeyata ke pairokaar or german gopneeyata samooh foebud ko germany main METRO future store main aamantrit kiya gaya, jahaan ek RFID payalat pariyojna lagu kii gai thi
 Incidentally it was revealed that the METRO "payback" Customer Loyalty Card contained RFID tags with a customer ID, a fact neither disclosed to the card-receiving customers nor to the group advocating privacy
 yah METRO dwaara is aashwaasan ke baavjood hua ki kisi graahak pahchaan data ko trek nahin kiya ja rahaa he or sabhi RFID upyog ko spasht rup se bataaya gaya he
 Between 16 and 18 November 2005, during the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society, the founder of the Free Software Movement, Richard Stollman, opposed the use of RFID security cards
 pehali baithak ke dauraan yah sahmati hui ki bhavishya kii baithkon main RFID card kaa upyog nahin kiya jayega or yah jaankaar ki is aashwaasan ko todaa gaya he, unhone apane card ko aluminium panni main lapet liya or ve ise keval suraksha steshnon par hi kholenge

 There are concerns that this could be abused by a totalitarian government or could result in the removal of independence
 22 july 2006 ko, riters ne suchit kiya ki do haikaron, navitz or westehus ne neuyork shahar main ek sammelan main darshaya ki ve ek maanav pratyaropit RFID chip se RFID sanket kaa clon bana sakate hai or sabit kiya ki yah chip hack-rodhi nahin he, jaisaa ki pehle daawa kiya gaya tha
 Surgery, even on a small scale, brings with it its risks
 RFID chip pratyaropan bhi koi apwaad nahin he
 According to David B
 Smith, author of "using Radio Frequency Identification Technology in Humans in the United States for Total Control," Smith gives examples of health risks such as "


 pratikul utak pratikriya, pratyaropit transponder kaa pravaas, samjhauta soochna suraksha, pratyaropit transponder kii vifaltaa, pratyaropan kii vifaltaa, electronic scinar kii vifaltaa, vidyut chumbakeey hastkshep bijli ke khatre, chumbakeey anunaad imaging asangati or nidel stick"
 Such risks can happen to anyone

 While this technology can help detect missing children or fugitives, on the other hand it allows governments to track any object or person with an RFID chip
 iske alaava, ise saidhantik rup se kisi vyakti kii jaankaree yaa sahmati ke bina kiya ja saktaa he; or isi baat par vivaad he

 "there has been a misconception that the world of comics is shrinking

 ” Pran's cartoon characters Chacha Chaudhary and Sabu became popular characters in each household

 That is why after much deliberation, he made bald, short, normal uncle Chaudhary, whose mind was very sharp
 vah apane dimag se har samasya kaa hal kar detaa he
 Uncle Chaudhary himself is not powerful, but Sabu, who comes from the planet Jupiter, with his extraordinary physical ability, fulfills this deficiency by staying with him like a shadow of Chacha Chaudhary
 is tarah sabu or chachaa choudhary mil kar aparaadhiyon ko pakadava dete he
 Cartoon films were also made on many of Pran's works
