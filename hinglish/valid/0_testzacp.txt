 Power is the only component in connecting renewable energy sources to the electric grid
 yahan tak ki radar pranali bhi shakti electronic par hi nirbhar he
 Although all small electronic components are used in power electronics, the following components are unique identities of power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kshetra main kaary, laghu-sanket-electraniki ke bhi pehle ho chukaa tha
 Electric machines were first used for the control and conversion of electric power
 iske baad mercury arq ractifire kaa prayog hua
 Then came the era of vacuum and gas-filled valves
 san 1957 main esasiaar ke vikaas se shakti electronic main ek nayi disha mili
 Nowadays, the use of switches like SCR, GTO, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT, etc
 is done very efficiently
 is kaaran shakti electronic kaa kshetra bahut vyapak evam mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc
 ye sab yuktiyaan electraniki kii hi dein hai
 Some of the industrial uses of electronics are briefly mentioned below: udyogon main bahudhaa rujukarak upyog main laae jate hai, jinase prayavarti vidyut-dhara nirdisht dhara main badali jaati he
 They are often of one of the following types: adhik shakti ke rujukari main bahukala rujukari paripathon kaa upyog ekkala rujukari paripathon ke upyog kii upeksha anek kaarnon se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 The first reason is that nowadays electric power is produced and distributed in the form of tri-art-power
 dwitiya kaaran yah he ki bahukala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata ekkala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata kii apeksha adhik sam hoti he
 In the above mentioned high power loan, either the same loan is kept for many moneylenders or many money bankers, whose loan lines are connected, are used

 This generator is driven by a prime mover
 janitr kaa armechar apana utpaadan us motor ko detaa he jisaki chaal kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 a sight-current generator is driven by this motor; It produces a voltage proportional to its speed
 yadi vah voltata purvanishchit voltata se bhinn hoti he to ek niamak ko sakriy kar detii he
 This regulator brings about such a change in the area of the exciter that the current of the motor falls to a predetermined value
 is niamak main anek naliyon kaa upyog hota he
 Thus with the help of electronics, the speed of the motor can be controlled to a minimum value

 Both of these methods require high frequency alternating current
 tapt kii janevaali dhaatu ke tukade ke chaaron ore ek kundali lapetakar usamen prayavarti dhara kaa pravaah karte hai
 The magnetic current generated by the current flows through the air and also through the metal present near the coil
 dhara ke utkraman se syand main bhi parivartan hota he, jiske kaaran dhaatu main voltata prerit ho jaati he
 Due to this voltage, a large amount of vortex current flows in the metal
 tab dhaatu ke pratirodh ke kaaran taap utpann ho jaataa he
 a power of 1,000 kilocycles or more than 1 meg of cycle is required to electrically conduct dielectric materials
 chunki vastu main hokar dhara pravaahit nahin ho sakati, isliye vastu ko ucch voltatawaale dhaatu ke platon ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 Due to the rapid change of the electric field, the changes in the molecule structure of the dielectric object also begin
 anuon ke bich main gharshan hone ke kaaran vastu main sab ore samaan taap utpann ho jaataa he
 By this method, thick sheets of dielectric objects can be heated in a very short time

 In the 19th century, according to the Prakashwari ether theory, an ethereal medium was envisaged in the universe
 iske anusaar prakaash tarange ether madhyam se ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par sancharit hoti hai
 The study of sound waves showed that these waves are transverse and require a medium to travel from one place to another and their transmission is the easiest in the solid
 isi aadhaar par jab vidyut chumbakeey tarango kii khoj ke pashchaat vaigyanikon ne dekha ki ye tarange anudardhy hoti hai or prakaash tarango ke samaan hoti hai
 Scientists hypothesized that these waves also need some medium to travel from one place to another, but how the light waves coming from the sun and stars reach the earth because there is a vacuum between them
 is dharna ko samajhane ke liye i san 1818 main auguston-jin fresnal ne sarvapratham ether siddhant diya
 Earlier in 1678, the German scholar Christian Hugens envisaged a light carrier like ether
 vaigyanikon kaa mat tha ki ether ek aisa madhyam he jo sarvyaapee he or prakaash tarange isi madhyam main gati karti hai
 Therefore, this medium was considered a medium for light waves
 ether ko dravyaman rahit mana gaya
 In 1810, Francis Argo stated that a change in the refractive index of a substance predicted by molecular theory could provide an important method in the measurement of the velocity of light

 This research has shown that the life of patients dying from renal failure can be prolonged

 The first patient who was successfully treated was a 67-year-old woman in a uremic coma who had regained consciousness after 11 hours of hemodialysis by a Kolf dialyser

 After the end of World War II, Kolff donated the five dialyzers he had made to various hospitals around the world, including Mount Sinai Hospital, New York
 Kolff gave the blueprint of his hemodialysis machine to George Thorne at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston

 By the 1950s, Willem Kolff's invention of the dialyzer was used for severe renal failure, but was not seen as a viable treatment for patients with stage 5 chronic renal disease
 us samay, doctoron maananaa tha ki rogiyon ke liye do kaarnon se anischitkaal tak dialysis karwaanaa asambhav tha

 Dr
 Nils Alwal: The original Kolp kidney was not clinically useful, as it did not allow the removal of excess fluid

 Alwal was arguably the inventor of arteriovenous shunts for dialysis
 unhone pehali baar isaki khabar 1948 main di jahaan unhone aise dhamnishiraparak shant kaa istemaal khargoshon main kiya
 He later used such a shunt made of glass, as well as his canister-locked dialyzer, to treat 1,500 patients with renal failure between 1946 and 1960, as he told the First International Nephrology Congress held in Avian in September 1960
 Told
 alvaal ko 1957 main lund vishvavidhyalay main nefrology ke ek nav nirmit pad par niyukt kiya gaya
 He then formed a major company in collaboration with the Swedish businessman Holger Krafford who later built the dialysis equipment, Gumbro, over the last 50 years

 Dr

 After treatment, the use of a small U-shaped Teflon tube will open the bloodstream connecting the two tubes outside the body, which will block the blood of the tube into the artery and go back into the vein from the tube

 These include frequency, length of each treatment and blood and dialysis solution flow rate, as well as the size of the dialyzer
 The composition of a dialysis solution is also sometimes adjusted in terms of its sodium and potassium and bicarbonate levels

 These side effects can be avoided and / or their severity may be limited by fluid intake in between treatments or reduced by increasing the dose of dialysis, for example, standard three times per week , Dialysis more often or more prolonged per treatment than 3-4 hours per treatment

 Long-term complications of hemodialysis include amyloidosis, neuropathy, and various cardiovascular diseases
 Increasing the frequency and length of treatment has been shown to improve fluid overload and increase heart rate, which is common in such patients
 vibhinn prakaar ke hemodialysis se judy vishisht jatiltaaon ko neeche soochibaddh kiya gaya he
 In hemodialysis, three primary methods are used to access the blood: an intravenous catheter, an arteriovenous fistula, and a synthetic graft
 The type of access is affected by some factors such as the expected time of a patient's kidney failure and the condition of his or her vasculature
 Multiple accesses may occur in patients, as usually an AV fistula or graft is maturing and a catheter is still being used
 sanvahani abhigam ke in teenon pramukh prakaar ke nirmaan main surgery kii aavashyaktaa he
 The use of a catheter, sometimes called a CVC, is made up of a plastic catheter with two lumens inserted into a large vein so that large amounts of blood can be extracted from a lumen and inserted into a dialysis circuit To go and return through other lumens
 haalanki, rakt pravaah lagbhag hameshaa ek acchhee tarah se kaary kar rahe nalwran yaa grapht kii tulana main kam hota he
 Catheters are usually found in two common varieties, tubular and non-tubular
 gaiyr nalika catheter abhigam, laghu avadhi abhigam ke liye hai or catheter, nas main pravesh ke sthal par twachaa se ubharta he
 Tubular catheter access involves a long catheter, which is inserted into the vein from the insertion point into the skin for an exit
 ise aamtaur par gale main aantarik greeva shira main daalaa jaataa he or nikaas sthaan aamtaur par chaati main hota he
 This tube acts as a barrier to invading microbes and as such, the catheter is designed for short to medium term use as infection is still a problem
 sankraman ke alaava, shiraparak sankuchan, catheter abhigam ke saath ek anya gambhir samasya he
 The catheter is an extracellular substance in the vein and often produces a burning reaction on the vein wall
 isse dhamni kaa scaring or sankuchan hota he, yahaan naadirodh bhi hota he
 This can lead to severe venous obstruction problems in the dry area by the vein and may also have an impact on the veins, which may be useless for the formation of fistulas or grafts at a later time
 lambii avadhi ke hemodialysis ke marij ko vastav main abhigam kii 'kami' ho sakati he, to yah ek ghaatak samasya ho sakati he
 Catheter access is typically used for quick access to quick dialysis, for duct access in patients who are likely to recover from severe renal failure, and for patients who are in the late stages of renal failure and who Either waiting for alternate access or who are unable to get alternate access
 catheter abhigam aksar marijon main lokapriy he, kyonki dialysis mashin se sampark ke liye sui kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 However, the serious risk of catheter access mentioned above means that such access should only be considered as a long-term solution in the most desperate situation
 avi nalpravan ko pasandida abhigam vidhi ke rup main pahachaanaa jaataa he
 To create a fistula, a vascular surgeon connects an artery and a vein through the anastomosis
 chunki yah keshikaon se bachakar nikal jaataa he, rakt, nalwran ke madhyam se tezi se bahata he
 a person can feel it by placing his finger on a mature fistula
 This is called a 'thrill' experience and produces a distinct 'buzzing' feeling over the fistula
 nalwran se guzarate hue rakt kii "fusfusaahat" ko ek stethoscope ke madhyam se suna ja saktaa he, is dhwani ko angreji main broot kaha jaataa he
 Fistulas usually form in the non-dominant arm and may be located on the arm, or on the arm or elbow
 a fistula may take several weeks to mature, an average of 4-6 weeks
 During treatment, two needles are inserted into the fistula, one to drain blood and one to be inserted back

 To prevent fistula and aneurysm damage or the formation of pseudo-aneurysm, it is recommended that the needle should be inserted sequentially at various points
 ek anya drushtikon he nalwran main ek bhothari sui dwaara pravesh karnaa, thik usee jagah par

 Often two or three buttonhole spaces are available on a given fistula

 AV grafts are, in most cases, very similar to fistulas, except that an artificial pulse is used to connect the artery and vein
 yah grapht aamtaur par synthetic saamagree se bana hota he, aksar PTFE se, lekin kabhi-kabhi rasinic rup se upachaarit hota he, pashuon kii visankramit shira kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Grafts are inserted when the patient's native blood vessel does not allow a fistula
 They mature faster than fistulas and may be ready for use for several weeks after formation
 However, AV grafts have a high risk of contraction, particularly in the vein just below where the graft is inserted
 Contraction often leads to clotting or thrombosis

 Options for other locations of grafts are available, as grafts can be made much longer

 Chronic hemodialysis is usually performed three times each week, approximately 3–4 hours for each treatment, during which the patient's blood is drawn out through a tube at a rate of 3–400 cc / min
 The tube is attached to a 15, 16 or 17 gauge needle inserted into a dialysis fistula or graft or connected to a port of a dialysis catheter
 rakt ko phir apohak ke madhyam se pump kiya jaataa he or tab sansaadhit rakt ko ek anya tub ke madhyam se waapas marij ke khun main daalaa jaataa he
 During this procedure, the patient's blood pressure is closely monitored and if it is reduced, or the patient develops another symptom of low blood volume, such as nausea, then the excess fluid through a dialysis attendant machine can give

 hemodialysis ke liye ek vyapak jal shodhan pranali bilkul mahatvapurn he
 Because dialysis patients are exposed to vast amounts of water, which is mixed with dialysate concentrate to form dialysate, mineral contaminants or bacterial endotoxins can enter the patient's blood
 kyonki kshatigrast gurde ashuddhiyon ko dur karne ke liye apane abhipret kaaryon kaa pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai, pani ke madhyam se rakt main pravisht aayan khatarnaak str tak pahunch sakate hai, parinamswaroop kai lakshan dikhaai dete hai yaa mrityu ho jaati he
 Aluminum, chloramine, fluoride, copper and zinc, as well as bacterial fragments and endotoxins, etc
 all cause problems in this regard
 is kaaran se, hemodialysis main upyog kiye jane vaale pani ko upyog se pehle saavdhaanee se shuddh kiya jaataa he
 Initially it is filtered and temperature adjusted and its ph is purified by adding an acid or base
 tab yah naram ho jaataa he
 The water is then released through a tank containing coal wood to absorb organic pollutants
 uske baad chote chhidr ke saath ek jhilli main pani ko jor se chhodane ke madhyam se praathmik shuddhi kii jaati he, jise asamas reverse jhilli kaha jaataa he
 This allows water to pass through, but prevents very small solutes such as electrolytes
 The water is released through a tank with ion exchange resins for the final removal of the remaining electrolytes which clears all the remaining ions or cations and transfer them along with the hydroxyl and hydrogen molecules and Makes water superfluous
 yahaan tak ki jal shodhan kii is str kii prakriya bhi aparyaapt ho sakati he
 a recent trend is the passing of this last purified water through the dialyzer membrane

 Almost all dialyzers currently used are of the hollow-fiber type
 khokhale fibre kaa ek belanaakaar bandal, jinaki diwaar arddh-pargamya jhilli se bani he, uske donon kinaaron par poting compound laga hota he
 This combination is then put into a clear plastic cylindrical shell with four exhausts
 prayek silendar ke ant par ek khulne vaala kinaaraa yaa rakt port khokhla fibre ke bandal ke prayek ant ke saath sampark banaata he
 This forms the "blood compartment" of the dialyzer
 do anya port ko silendar ke kinare main kaata jaataa he
 This hollow fiber makes contact with the locations around the "dialacet compartment"
 bahut patali keshika-jaisi nalee ke bandal ke madhyam se rakt port ke dwaara rakt pump hoti he or fibre ke aas-paas ke sthanon ke madhyam se dilaset pump hoti he
 Pressure gradient is applied when it is needed to send the fluid from the blood to the dialyzer compartment

 Those that come with significantly smaller hole sizes are called "low-flow" and those with larger pore sizes are called "high-flow"
 beta-2-microglobulin jaise kuch bade anu, nune-pravaah apohak ke saath kabhi bhi hataaya ja saktaa he; baad main ucch pravaah apohak kaa hi istemaal hone laga
 However, such dialyzers require new dialyzer machines and high quality dialyzer solutions to properly remove the fluid rate and to prevent the flow of dialyzer solution inaccuracies through the membrane into the patient
 apohak jhilli ko mukhya rup se selulose se banaaya jaataa tha
 The surface of such membranes was not very organic in nature, as the exposed hydroxyl group activates the complement in the blood circulation through the membrane
 isliye, buniyadi, "ansabstituted" selulose jhilli ko sanshodhit kiya gaya tha
 One change in this was that these hydroxyl groups were covered with the acetate group; And mixing in some compounds was the second change that would have to prevent activation complement in the membrane surface
 mul "ansabstituted selulose" jhilli kaa ab vyapak prayog nahin hota he, jabaki selulose acitate or sanshodhit selulose apohak kaa abhi bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Sallulosic membranes can be formed in either low flow or high flow configurations, depending on the size of their holes
 jhilli ke ek anya samooh ko synthetic saamagree se banaaya jaataa he, jisamen bahulak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jaise poliyaralethraslphone, poliyamide, polvinalpirolidone, polikarbonate or poliecrilonitril
 in synthetic jhilli ko ansabstituted selulose jhilli ke bajaae ek kam degree ke liye poorak ko sakriy kiya jaataa he
 Synthetic membranes can be made in low or high flow configurations, but most are made of high flow
 ek ekikrut rome chhidr ke nirmaan ke liye nanotechnology kaa istemaal sabase haal hi main ucch pravaah jhilli main kiya ja rahaa he
 The goal of high-flux membranes is to pass relatively large molecules such as beta-2-microglobulin, but not to pass albumin
 har jhilli ke paas aakaar kii ek seemaa main chhidr hota he
 As the pore size increases, some high-flow dialyzers begin to pass albumin from the blood into the dialysate
 iske liye ise avaanchhneeya mana jaataa he, yadhyapi ek prakaar ke vichaarkon ke samooh ne mana ki albumin ko baahar karnaa protein vaali uremic jehar ko dur karne kii drushti se phydemand ho saktaa he
 Whether or not the use of a high flow dialyzer improves patient outcomes is somewhat controversial, but several important studies have suggested that it is a therapeutic benefit

 a study by MPO, a Europe partner from a randomized trial, had an early dialyze in patients using high-flow or low-flow membranes who found high-flow membranes to be unimportant in improving survival and low serum
 Albumin level or survival benefit was found in diabetic patients
 ucch-pravaah dialysis jhilli or / yaa aantrayik online hemodyphiltreshan bhi beta-2-microglobulin kii jatiltaaon ko kam karne main laabhadaayak ho saktaa he
 Because beta-2-microglobulin is a large molecule with a molecular weight of about 11,600 daltons, it does not cross through a low-flow dialysis membrane
 beta-2-em ko ucch pravaah dialysis se hataaya jaataa he, lekin ise IHDF dwaara or adhik kushalta se hataaya jaataa he
 After several years, beta-2-m deposition complications begin to develop in patients with hemodialysis, including carpal tunnel syndrome, marrow ulcers and accumulation of this amyloid in joints and other tissues
 beta-2-m amyloidosis can cause very serious complications, such as spondyloarthropathy and is often associated with shoulder joint problems

 So dialyzers are generally expressed as K0A - as a product of permeability coefficient and area
 Most dialyzers have a membrane area of 0

 Percussive pacing, also called transthoracic mechanical pacing, is the use of closed fists, usually inserted from a distance of 20–30 cm into the vena cava of the right ventricle, downward on the left edge of the sternum to catalyze the venticular rhythm
 yah ek puraani prakriya he jiskaa istemaal marij ke liye vidyutiya pesamekar nahin le aane tak jivan raksha ke saadhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Transcutaneous pacing, also called external pacing, is typically recommended to maintain initial stability in blood circulation in every type of symptom of decreased heartbeat
 yah prakriya pacing ke dwaara marij ke seene main do pacing, yaa to sharir ke agr / parshv bhaag main yaa phir agr / pichley bhaag main pad laga kar kii jaati he
 The rescuer selects the rate of pacing and gradually increases the flow of the pacing until the power is captured with the corresponding pulse
 The pacing is the artifact of the ECG and the strong muscle twitching can make the representation difficult
 bahut lambii avadhi ke liye vahya pacing kaa bharosa nahin kiya janaa chahie
 It is an emergency procedure that acts as a bridge until transvenous pacing or other treatment is given
 asthaayee epicardial pacing, jiskaa istemaal open heart surgery ke samay hota he, aalind prakosht main avrodh paidaa karne kii ek shalya prakriya he
 The electrode is placed along the outer wall of the ventricle to maintain satisfactory cardiac output until a temporary transvenous electrode is inserted
 jab asthaayee pacing kaa upyog karnaa ho tab transvenus pacing transkutanyas pacing kaa vikalp hota he
 The pacemaker wire is inserted into the vein in a sterile condition, and is then either inserted into the right atrium or into the right ventricle
 The pacing wire is then attached to the external pacemaker outside the body
 transvenus pacing kaa upyog aksar sthaayee pesamekar ke niyojan ke pul ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It can be kept until the permanent pacemaker is implanted or until the pacemaker is no longer needed and is then removed
 sthaayee pacing ek pratyaropan yogya pesamekar ke saath hriday ke ek prakoshth yaa prakoshthon main ek yaa ek se adhik pacing electrode transvenus niyojan se judaa hota he
 This process is accomplished by making an incision in the appropriate vein, into which the electrode is inserted and it passes through that vein through the heart valve until it is inserted into the cell
 This procedure is accomplished with the facility of fluoroscopy, enabling the physician or cardiologist to visualize the passage of the electrode lead
 electrode lead ke vipareet sire kaa pesamekar jenerator se jud jane ke baad electrode ke santoshjanak pratisthaapan kii pushti ho jaati he
 There are three basic types of permanent pacemakers, which are classified on the basis of how many number of cells are connected and their basic circulatory system: pesamekar jenerator aavat rup se bhalee bhaanti band urja strot kaa upkaran he, aamtaur par lithium bydaree he, jisamen ek samvedan amlyphaire hota he jo hriday ke electrode, pesamekar ke liye computer logic or output circuit, jo pacing aaveg ko electrode ko pradaan karata he, dwaara samvedit hone par hriday ke swaabhaavit rup se honevaale vidyutiya aavirbhaav ko sansaadhit karata he
 The generator typically sings below the fat in the chest wall, above the chest muscle and bone
 haalanki alag-alag maamle ke aadhaar par yah bhinn bhi ho saktaa he
 This is why the upper cover of the pacemaker is designed in such a way that the body's immune system will rarely reject it
 aamtaur par yah titanium se bana hota he, jo sharir main akriy hota he
 Like piercing, this whole thing will not be rejected and the tissue will corrode it
 aadhunik pesamekar ke aamtaur par bahut tarah ke kaary hote hai
 The most basic of these is to monitor the basic electrical rhythm of the heart
 jab pesamekar saamaanya dhadakanon ke bich kii samay kii avadhi main hriday kii dhadkan ko mahasoos karne main asafal ho jaataa, tab bahut hi kam voltage ke nabj ke saath yah hriday ke nilay ko uttejit karegaa
 Its activation and sensation is based on each beat
 iskaa or adhik jatil rup main aalind or nilay donon prakoshtho kii samvednaa or / athwa uttejnaa kii kshamta shaamil he
 Of this, the basic venticular demanding pacing mode is VVI or VVIR with automatic rate adjustment for exercise - this mode is suitable when synchronization is not required along the rhythm of the atrium, as in atrial fibrillation
 The equivalent atrial pacing mode is AAI or AAIR, which is the preferred mode when the atrioventicular position is unbroken, but the natural pacemaker's cyanoatrial node is unreliable - sinus node disease or sick sinus syndrome
 jahaan aatrioventicular block kii samasya ho to aalind kii taal kaa pataa lagane or saamaanya der ke baad venticular taal ke pravartan ke liye pesamekar kii jarurat hoti he, jab tak ki yah karne ko taiyaar nahin ho jaataa – yah VDD mod he or ek electrode lead se daahine aalind or nilay main ek single pacing lead se praapt kii ja sakati he
 AAIR and VDD These modes are uncommon in the US, but are widely used in Latin America and Europe
 DDDR mod kaa istemaal sabase aam he, kyonki isamen sabhi vikalp samaaye hue hai, haalanki pesamekar ko aalind or nilay ke liye alag se lead kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tathaa se bahut hi jatil hote hai, achche se achche nattejey ke liye inke kaaryon kii saavdhaneepurvak programing kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The venticular pacemaker, also known as, is a type of pacemaker that can run on both the membrane wall and the lateral side of the left ventricle
 baayen nilay ke donon ore pacing ke dwaara pesamekar hriday, jisaki deevaare tulykaalik ke sampark main nahin hoti, ko phir se samakalik kar saktaa he, jo 25-50% hridayaghat ke marijon main dekhne main aata he
 CRT devices have at least two leads in the ventricle, one is inserted to stimulate the right ventricular membrane, and the other through the aortic vein to run into the lateral wall of the left ventricle
 aksar marijon main saamaanya shira lay ke liye aalind sankuchan ke saath samakalik sugamawa ke liye daahine aalind main ek lead hota he
 In this way, the time between contraction of the left ventricular membrane wall and lateral wall along the atrium and ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function
 hridayaghat ke lakshanwale marijon ke maamle main CRT upkaran ne mrityu dar main kami or jivan kii gunvattta main badhottaree ko dikhaaya he; LV utsarjan kaa ansh 35% se kam yaa baraabar or EKG main QRS kii avadhi 120 micro second yaa isse adhik hoti he
 CRT can be combined with a replaceable cardioverter-defibrillator
 dar-anukriyasheel pesamekar banane ke liye vibhinn samagriyon kaa istemaal karke prakruti ke anukaran kaary main aage badhane kaa ek bada kadam rahaa, iske liye QT interval, dhamni-shiraparak pranali main pco - pco2, pravegmapi dwaara shaareerik gatividhi kaa nirdhaaran, shaareerik taapmaana, ATP str, adrinalin, aadi parameter kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Rather than presenting statics, predetermined heart rates, or intermittent controls such as pacemakers, the 'active pacemaker' can compensate for both the actual respiratory load and the expected expected load
 pehle gatisheel pesamekar kaa avishkaar 1982 main UK, landan main naishanal health hospital ke dow antony ricards dwaara kiya gaya tha

 Once implanted a lot have been developed to improve the control of pacemakers
 inamen se kai main paraagaman ke dwaara microprocesar niyantrit pesamekaron kaa bananaa sambhav hua he
 The pacemaker that controls not only the ventricle but also the atrium is very common
 vah pesamekar jo nilay or aalind donon ko niyantrit karata he, doharaa kaksh pesamekar kehalaata he
 Although these double-chamber models are usually expensive, pre-ventricular contraction time improves the pumping capacity of the heart and can be useful in congestive heart attack
 anukriyasheel pacing kii dar upkaran ko marij kii shaareerik gatividhi ko padhane or elgoridam ke jariye aadharbhoot pacing dar main vruddhi yaa hvaas dwaara yathopayogi tareeke se use anukool banane kii anumati detaa he
 The use of DAVID showed that unnecessary pacing in the right ventricle may cause a heart attack and increase the incidence of fibrillation in the atrium
 dohare kaksh vaale naveen upkaran daahine nilay kii pacing kii maatra ko nunatam banaae rakh saktaa he or is tarah hriday kii beemaari ko or adhik kharaab hone se roak saktaa he
 The pacemaker is usually inserted into the patient's body via a general surgery using either a local anesthetic or a general anesthetic
 isi tarah surgery se pehle marij ko aaraam ke liye koi aushadhi bhi di ja sakati he
 An antibiotic is usually given to prevent infection
 zyaadaatar maamalon main pesamekar baayen kandhe ke ilaake main daalaa jaataa he, hansuli kii haddi ke neeche chira laga kar ek chota pocket banaakar daalaa jaataa he, marij ke sharir main pesamekar ko darasal, yaheen rakhaa jaataa he
 a lead or several leads are inserted through a large vein, a fluoroscope is used to monitor progress in this work
 ek asthaayee nikaas ko sthapit kiya ja saktaa he or agle din ise hataa diya jaataa he
 The actual surgery may take up to an hour
 surgery ke baad marij ko aarogy kii ore badhate hue ghaav kaa uchit dhyaan rakhana chahie
 It also has a follow-up session, during which the pacemaker is tested through a programmer so that it can connect with the device and allow health care professionals to evaluate the integrity of the system and determine the voltage output of the pacing Give
 surgery se pehle marij kuch buniyadi taiyaari par vichaar karnaa chaah saktaa he
 The most basic preparation is that people who have chest hair may want to remove it by shaving or depilatory, as bandages and monitoring equipment will be fitted with the body after surgery
 chunki pesamekar bydaree kaa upyog karata he, isiilie bydaree kii kshamta kam ho jane par is upkaran ko badalane kii jarurat hogi
 Changing the device is usually a simpler process than putting in a new device, as it usually does not require implantation
 a special type of replacement requires surgery, which requires an incision to remove the existing equipment, remove the lead from the existing device, attach the lead to the new device, and add the new device to the patient
 Is put in place of the old instrument of the body

 ek baar pratyaropit kar die jane ke baad is upkaran ke thik se sanchaalan or kaary karne kii satyata sunishchit karne ke liye niyatkaalik jaanch jaruri he
 Depending on its frequency, it may often be necessary to periodically check the device after it has been set by the physician
 pesamekar kii saamaanya jaanch aamtaur par karyaalay main har chah maheene main hoti he, haalanki yah marij / upkaran kii sthiti or alag se nigaraanee kii uplabdhta par nirbhar he
 Information will be obtained from clinical examination of the equipment at the time of testing in the office
 These tests include the following: aajkal pesamekar kii bahut "maang" he, kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki jaruri ho bhi ve chalate hai, upkaran kaa lambey samay tak chalanaa kis paimaane par iskaa upyog hota he isse prabhavit hota he
 There are other factors that affect the durability of the device, including program output and algorithms that cause a high level of current to flow from the battery
 karyaalay main pareekshan kaa atirikt pahalu yah he ki kisi ghatana kii jaanch karnaa he jo pichley anuvarthi pareekshan ke baad se ekatra hue hai
 These are usually stored for the patient by medical on specific criteria
 kuch upkaran main ghatana shuru hone se pehle, saath hi us ghatana kii intra cardiyak electrogram ko dikhaane kii visheshta nihit hoti he
 This is particularly useful in diagnosing the cause and its origin and making any necessary programming changes
 pesamekar lagane ke baad marij kii jeevanstyli main aamtaur par koi bada badlaav nahin aata he
 Some activities that are purely sports related and activities involving magnetic fields are not appropriate
 pesamekar marij ko lag saktaa he ki unhen kuch rosemara ke kaaryon main badlaav laane kii jarurat he
 For example, it may be inconvenient if the seat seat of the carriage on the shoulder crosses the space of the pacemaker
 aisi koi gatividhi jo atyadhik chumbakeey kshetra judi he, se bachanaa chahie
 This includes activities like that, such as arc welding, or certain types of equipment, maintenance of heavy equipment, which produces strong magnetic fields), etc

 saathottaree hindi sahitya hindi sahitya ke itihaas ke antargat san 1960 i0 ke baad mukhyatah navlekhan yug se kaaphi had tak bhinnata kii pratiti karaane vaali aisi peedi ke dwaara rachit sahitya he jinamein vidroh evam araajaktaa kaa swar pradhan tha
 However, along with it the parallel stream of spontaneity and democratic consciousness was also prevalent in the field of literature, which later became popular
 saathottaree lekhan main vidrohi chetanayukta aandolan praathmik rup se kavita ke kshetra main mukhar hui
 Therefore, all the movements related to it were mainly poetry movements
 haalaanki kahani evam anya vidhaon par bhi iskaa asar paryaapt rup se padaa or kahani ke kshetra main bhi 'akahani' jaise aandolan ne rup dhaaran kiya
 Around sixty, the stream of new poetry began to look somewhat different from itself
 saath ke baad jo nayaa mode lakshith hota he vah ekaek deekhne vaali koi naveen vastu nahin, varan nayi kavita se hi phuta hua he
 The tone of discontent, disapproval and rebellion has emerged very clearly in the later sixties
 nayi kavita main bhi asantosh or asweekruti kaa swar vidyaman he, kintu saath ke baad is swar ne or tikhe vyangy or vidroh kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he, jivan kii tuutati murtiyon ke bahut kareeb jaakar unki tuutane kii talkhi, vyathaa or usamen se footati asweekruti kii ugrata ko pahachaanaa he
 The greatest feature of the new poem is that it conveyed authentic experiences of the whole life in their living environment
 vishay yaa anubhuti ke abhijatya or bhinn-bhinn drushtiyon yaa vaadon se bane hue unke gheron ko todakar vyakti dwaara bhoge jate hue jivan ke har chote-bade satya ko pratikon or bimbon ke madhyam se ubhaarne main hi usne kavita kii sarthakata samajhi
 But overall, despite the pain in the poets of the new poem, there remained a positive hope for future creation
 swatantryottar bharat kii tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ke kaaran unamem hataasha or tuutan kaa bhav kaaphi tha parantu sapane puure hone kii ek ksheen aashaa bhi bachi rahi thi
 Disillusionment or disillusionment did not occur as a whole, so the new poem has a sense of torture, a tone of disapproval, but not a revolt
 dhire-dhire 'ilugen' ek dam tut gayi, mohabhang ho gaya
 The social environment of the person started to look more ugly, dreams of the future were broken
 dow0 bachchan singh ke shabdon main kaviyon ke ugaae hue suraj main roshni nahin aayi-- surya kaa swaagat vyarth chalaa gaya
 Many litterateurs began to see only two ways that either they would express the intense feeling of pain by adding tone to the head of the new poem, or all these circumstances would make their sensitive mind emerge from the midst of torture and torture
 Everything started to inspire rejection
 sahitya main ye donon dharaayen raheen, parantu san saath ke turat baad vidrohi dhara pradhan rahi jinamein se adhikansh nirlakshya yaa yon-vikrutilakshi thim
 By being objective, these poems were conveniently revolting, that is, where there was a danger in rebellion, there was rebellion where there was convenience
 saathottaree hindi sahitya kaa pehla dashak aadhuniktawaad se vishesh prabhavit he
 It is important to note that there is a difference between modern and modernity
 'aadhunik' 'madhyakaalin' se alag hone kii soochna detaa he
 'modern' is the result of scientific inventions and industrialization while 'modernism' is the result of excesses of industrialization, metropolitan monotony, the catastrophe of two great wars
 dow0 bachchan singh ke anusaar "vastutah naveen gyaan-vigyaan, technology ke falswaroop utpann visham maanviya sthitiyon ke naye, gaiyr-romentic or amithkeey saakshaatkaar kaa naam 'aadhuniktaa' he
 " aadhuniktaavaadi sahitya ek vishesh prakaar kaa sahitya he
 It rejects established culture, values and sensibilities
 yah duniya kii manyataon ko manjuur nahin karti, parampara ko bedi ke rup main leti he
 The modernist undertakes interludes, mocking the values, he is a rebel
 bheed kaa virodh karata he, vah vyakti kii mukti kaa vishwasi he
 He finds himself in a non-human condition, and expels affection, gratitude etc
 sanyam kii kami, prayog, sahitya roopon kii tod-phod, shock dene kii manovriti, aakrosh-kshobh-hinsa kii aakanksha aadi isaki visheshtaayen yaa 'motiff' hai
 Among the many trends that have been active in the poetry field, experiencing the isolation from the new poem, the most notable is Ginsberg, Rajkamal Chaudhary emerging in Hindi parallel to American Beatnik and hungry poets like Malay Raychaudhuri and Subimal Basak of Bengal influenced by them
 Some other poets related to poetry and rejected poetry who wrote about 'hetero sexuality' and 'open secrecy'
 Specific assumptions made by adopting an attempt to your 'disfiliatt' society
 unki kavita main yon shabdaawalee kaa nanga prayog, apane vikshobh or aakrosh ko vyakt karne ke liye praayah ek sanskarahinta evam vikruti ke rup main miltaa he
 Rajkamal Chaudhary has been considered the leading poet of this decade
 raajakmal choudhary main aadhuniktaa apni samagrata main dikhaai padati he
 Chaudhary's imprint can be seen on most of the compositions of this time
 bitanic aandolan hindi main ek fishan kii tarah aayaa or kuch hi samay main nishprerak ho gaya kyonki uski jaden desh ke yatharth main nahin thim
 Actually he was a poet of anger
 apni aakroshpurna vaani main ye apana gussa utaarte rahe
 He continued to express his screams, wounds and sexual innuendo in poetry, rejecting all the previous values and traditions
 parantu, yuyutsavadi, nav pragatisheel yaa nav pragativaadee kaviyon ne saamaajik mulyon par bal dete hue in bitanicon se apni asahmati vyakt kii
 After the new poem, so many slogans were heard in a short period in the field of Hindi poetry, so many movements came that no other literature of the world had such a lot of slogans and movements in such a short period
 inamen se kuch andolan or naare to samay kii gard main hi dab gayi kintu kuch vikaas ke path par bade bhi
 In fact, the nutritious compositions of these movements were also similar to each other and sometimes the same poet followed many movements
 sahitya-rachana kaa yah samay andolanon kii arajak baadh kaa samay rahaa
 The names of these movements are mainly poem-oriented
 is dashak main baadh kii tarah aaye kavita-andolanon main vyavastha-virdohi andolanon ke saath-saath vyavastha-samarthak kai andolan bhi the; parantu praayah in sabhi andolanon main suvyavasthit chintan kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran praayah ye sabhi laghujivi siddh hue
 The general introduction of both these types of main movements is visible in the following headings
 march 1962 ke 'bharti' ke ank main srivirendrakumar jain ne 'sanathan suryodayi' nayi kavita kii ghoshnaa kii
 Expressing his intentions, he said that "we are wandering in the shadowless direction of fall-defeat, frustration, complacency and living suicides, in the face of the destitute poetic consciousness
 Carrying in, taking in nectar from death and taking away the leel of limitless in the border - the imperative Sanatan Suryodayi Nutan Kavita stream of tomorrow to come free We do
 " is prakaar is andolan kaa mukhya swar vyavastha kaa hi tha, parantu lagbhag 3 saal baad hi 'bharti' ke hi farvari 1965 i0 ke ank main 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke sthaan par 'nutan kavita' kaa swar sunai dene laga
 Former supporters of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita' like Gangaprasad Vimal joined themselves in the 'akavita' category
 yuyutsavadi kavita kaa sambandh 'yuyutsa' naamak patrika se rahaa he
 Shalabh Sriram Singh was the originator of the Yutaswadi poetry
 unki manyata rahi he ki aadim yuyutsa hi sahityasarjan kii mul prerana he
 He says that "I accept the same primitive youth as the original inspiration for literature, which has been at the core of every revolution, change or dissolution somewhere
 vah yuyutsa jijeevishaavaadi, mumurshavadi, vidrohatmak athwa platonic kuch bhi ho sakati he
 "in 'roopambra' of April 1965, under the 'commencement', this quote of Shalabh Sriram Singh was given by the Swadesh Indians while declaring 'yuyotsa is the only cause of all'"
 'roopambara' ke hi agast 1966 ke 'adhunathan kavita ank' main 'yuyutsavadi navlekhan pradhan sahakaari prayaas' ke rup main saamne aayaa, teen kaviyon ke vaktavy sahit
 The editor also raised the issue of new sensibilities
 vimal pandeya, rameshwaradutt maanav, om prabhakar, bajrang bishnoi aadi ne bhi apane aap ko is andolan se sambandhit kiya
 Vimal Pandey tried to associate 'yuyotsavada' with 'angry Young Man'
 shri om prabhakar ne 'yuddhechha' ko sanathan vritti maanate hue yuyutsa ko jijeevishaa kaa paryaay mana he
 Bajrang Bishnoi has linked the question of commitment to Yuyutsa
 'utkarsh' patrika ke july '66 ke ank main shriram shukla ne 'asweekrut kavita' kaa naaraa buland kiya or 'ek lambii asweekrut kavita' 'mari hui aurat ke saath sambhog' sheershak se prastut kii
 For Shukla ji, the experience of sexual intercourse is enough - to carry seven epics
 ' asweekrut kavita ke pravaktaa kavi kii manyata he-- "satya ko satya na kah paane kii vishmata kabhi na kabhi avrodh todakar bah nikalati he or tabhi janm hota he asweekrut kavita kaa
 "and" is a communicative poem of specific tendencies, emotions, situations, values, inconsistencies and moods, disproved in the present era, but also rejected
 " asweekrut kavita yon vikrutiyon kii kavita he
 The use of vulgar words is readily accepted for them and according to them they are anxious to 'change disliked arrangements'
 hal na prastut kar sake to bhi 'un par prashn chihn lagaakar besudh logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa' ye apana kartavya samajhate hai
 Dr
 Shyam Parmar, the narrator of 'akvita', has been considered, but Jagdish Chaturvedi was also an equal partner with him and was among the early proponents of 'akvita'
 vastutah 'akavita' patrika ke teen sampadak the-- jagadish chaturvedi, shyaam parmaar or rabindranath tyaagi
 Theoretical articles in support of Akvita were often not published in 'akvita' magazine
 un logon kii manyata thi kii 'baat bolegi ham nahin'
 However, Dr
 Shyam Parmar also wrote a book titled 'akvita and art-references' in support of Akvita, which attempted to define multiple verses
 jagadish chaturvedi is varg ke kaviyon ke dwaara bauddhik str par jeeye gayi jivan kii ekangita, visangati tathaa kachot ko sapraan abhivyakti pradaan karne kii sachetanta ke kaaran tathaa kavy kii puraatan parampara se pruthakta ke kaaran is kavy ko 'abhinav kavy' kii sangya dete hue kehete hai ki "unhen 'anti-kavy' ke saarth-vaahakon ke rup main pariganit kiya ja saktaa he
 "but Shyam Parmar does not consider Akvita as anti-poetry or anti-poetry
 ve akavita ko 'antarvirodhon kii anveshak kavita' maanate hai
 According to him, the specialty of this poetry movement is in the fact that "the tendencies of poets are associated with different mindsets"
 " "akavita kaldharmee kavita he
 It will be a limited-time poem, as it will not have to hoist flags in the future
 " tathaa "akavita main abhivyakti ke anek str sambhav hai
 In language and narrative, he is not committed, hence 'flexible'
 usamen jatil or 'tipsi' prakriyaayein hai-- sidhi or tuuti baaten hai
 "akavita's spokesperson Kavi also mentions that" new poetry or newcomers are not worthy of opposition to Akavita
 aandolan vritti ke log vyarth hi ise gut yaa shadyantr kii sangya dete hai
 " akavita ke andolan ko bhi bitanic aandolan ke saath jude hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 However, its proponents Jagdish Chaturvedi and Shyam Parmar described the behavior of the Beatnikis as blasphemous and absolutely denied their involvement with 'akvita'
 san 1965 se 67 tak nikalne vaali 'akavita' patrika ke prastaavkon main girijakumar maathur, prabhakar machave, bharat bhushan agarwal, vimal or atul aadi ke naam bhi saamne aaye the
 In this context, the works of Saumitra Mohan and Mudrarakshas are also notable
 america bitanic prabhaav ke kaaran dow0 prabhakar machave, bangla prabhaav ke kaaran raajakmal choudhary tathaa ginsvarg ke prabhaav ke kaaran trilochan or shamsher bahadur singh ne bhi beet kavita se apane aap ko sambhddha kiya tha
 In magazines called 'kriti' and 'expression', Machwe ji also declared his belief
 elahabaad se prakashit 'vidrohi peedi' ke kaviyon par bhi apratyaksh rup se yah prabhaav dikhaa
 Laxmikant Varma was the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 verma ji pehle 'nayi kavita' ke bade samarthakon main se the
 He wrote the first important book related to the theoretical analysis of new poetry, 'paradigms of new poetry'
 parantu, baad main manyata badalane par ve 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak bane
 She started the movement of 'fresh poetry' because in the new poem, there was no longer any 'newness' and she had become distinguished in a particular way
 verma ji kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki "nayi kavita kaa adhikansh paroksh rup se nabhinal dwaara chhayavaad se jeevanshkti letaa rahaa tha
 "however, even this movement of 'fresh poetry' could not go on
 july 1965 tak main hi verma ji kaa saath nibhaane vaala koi ek kavi yaa lekhak bhi saamne nahin aayaa or "bina kisi shor-gul ke, 'taaji kavita' ke tajie apane aap dafn ho gayi
 " patibaddh kavita ke saath dow0 parmanand shrivastav kaa naam judaa hua he
 Dr
 Srivastava's belief is: "I believe that there is no other option in front of Kavita to interview the entire humanitarian of today and fight against the dehumanization induced by the capitalist system
 " tathaa "patibaddh kavita ke daayre main 'bhashaa' ek mahatvapurn astr he-- uparyukt sangharsh kaa
 "dr
 Srivastava has also further defined the nature of the struggle--" Conflict is a straightforward and meaningful word in committed poetry - it has no disguise - people who do not accept any kind of commitment create false conflict and Let's enjoy it
 is prakaar yah andolan aadhuniktawaad athwa araajaktaa se dur vyavastha kaa hi andolan tha or marxvad kaa hi ek rup tha
 There was an ideology, a political vision behind it
 sahaj kavita kaa sutaradhar dow0 rabindra bhramar ko mana gaya he
 This movement also had no connection with modernism or far-fetchedness
 iske samarthakon main acharya hajariprasad dvivedi, acharya nandadulaare vaajapeyi, agyeya, dinakar, dow0 nagendra, dow0 devraj, dow0 indranath madan, dow0 prabhakar machave or ramdarsh mishra ke naam shaamil the
 Dr
 Shyam Parmar and Rajkamal Chaudhary also supported it
 march 1967 main sahaj kavita kii vijyapti prakashit hui
 The excerpts of the communiqué are as follows: "after the '60s, the craftsmanship of manorism in a class was considered to be the original goal and Hindi poetry emerged as a trade of crooked lines altogether
 isiilie vah fishan rahi he or bahut arthpurna bhi nahin xxrep 4 
 "so the goal of this poem is to" search for poetry from afresh "
 dow0 paramanand shrivastav, rajendra prasad singh, dow0 kumaar vimal, shrikant joshi, dow0 shyamsundar ghosh, dow0 vishvambharnath upaadhyaay, dow0 ganapatichandra gupt tathaa shivapratap singh ne 1968 i0 main prakashit 'sahaj kavita' naamak sangrah ke apane lekhon main sahaj kavita kaa samarthan kiya
 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar defined Sahaja poetry in his article as follows - "the etymological meaning of the word 'sahaj' in the context presented will have to be 'saha jayate iti sahajah
 ' arthath jo rachana yatharth anubhuti samveg ke saath vaani ke moort madhyam main janm leti he, vah sahaj he
 From this point of view, authenticity of cognition is the primary object
 anubhuti pratyaksh tathaa pramanik hui to abhivyakti akrutrim or ajatil hogi
 "and" Sahaja's demand is social, despite being objective
 " dow0 bhramar ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko bhi sahaj kavita ke saath sambhddha karke dekha he : "apane yug ke jivan or sarjanaatmak daayitv se sahaj kavita puri tarah patibaddh he
 At its core lies the realization of simple life and a sincere effort to search for a medium of simple craft
 " The name of the new song appeared in a magazine called 'geetangini' published from Muzaffarpur in February 1958
 is patrika main kuch navagit bhi sankalit the
 Some authors consider the development of the new song to be parallel to the new poem and consider it to be a special genre of new poetry
 'navagit' kaa pratham samavet sankalan 'kavita' 1964 main om prabhakar ke sampadan main prakashit hua
 With this, Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, Ramdarsha Mishra and Dr
 Ramesh Kuntal appeared as spokespersons of the Megh Navgita
 is sankalan main niraala se lekar nayi peedi tak ke anek geetkaaron ke geet sankalit the
 This movement of the new song was completely different from the other sixty-second momentary movements
 na to ise araajaktaa aadi se koi lenaa-dena tha or na hi waisi shaak aadi dene kii koi pravriti
 This genre has established itself
