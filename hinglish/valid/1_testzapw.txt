 This practice was adopted when rulers of other religions or society posed a threat to Christianity

 When they become more numerous, they manifest Christianity
 hollywood film 'agora' main gupt isiyat ko dikhaaya gaya he
 In Greek, the word crypto means hidden or secret
 krypto chrishchiyan * kaa arth hua gupt-isai
 The important thing in this is that crypto-christians are not abusive or negative words
 krypto-chrischiyanity isai dharm kii ek sansthagat practice he
 Under the basic principle of crypto-christianity, in the country where Christians reside, they worship the God of that country, they believe that there is a religion which is their camouflage; But in fact they are Christians from inside and continue to preach Christianity
 krypto chrishchiyan kaa sabase pehla udhaaharan roman samajya main miltaa he jab isaiyat ne shruwati daur main rome main apane pair rakhe the
 Immediately the great Roman emperor Trajan considered Christianity a threat to Roman culture and proposed to all the Roman Christians who were either to abandon Christianity or suffer the death penalty

 In Japan these crypto-christians were called "kakure-christian ***"
 kakure-chrishchiyan ne baudhon ke dar se isai dharm se sambadhit koi bhi kitaab rakhni band kar di
 They prayed to worship Jesus and Mary, which sounded Buddhist mantras, but contained the words of the Bible
 ye isai prarthanaayen kakure-chrischiyanon ne ek peedi se duusari peedi maukhik rup se hastantarit kerani shuru kar di
 From 1550 to the next 400 years, kakure-christian lived under the pseudo-philosophy of Buddhism

 Just as Japan's crypto is called Christian Kakure, the countries of Asia Minor are called Drovartso in Serbia, Patsloi in Cyprus, Laramanoi in Albania, Crypto Maronite in Lebanon and Crypto Copts in Egypt

 Many Christians in Punjab are under the cover of Sikhism, wear a turban, wear a beard, saber, a kadha but wear Sikhism but all of them are secret Christians

 Who became a Dalit and rubbed all his life and when he saw the process of burial according to Christianity on his death, it was understood that it is crypto-christian
 desh me aise bahut se krypto-chrishchiyan hai jo hindu naamon main hindu dharm par hamalaa karke sirf vatican kaa agenda badha rahen hai
 We see crypto-christians every day in everyday life but do not understand them because they are hidden in the camouflage of Hindu names
 jaise ki– Naxalites with Hindu names who killed Swami Lakshmanananda are crypto Christians
 jis rajya ne sabase adhik hindi gayak die us rajya bengal main hindi kaa virodh karne vaale krypto chrishchiyan hai
 The earliest example of Gupta Christianity is found in the Roman Empire when Christianity set its feet in Rome in the early days

 Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid capital punishment
 ve upar se romi devi devataaon kii puja karte rahe, par andar se isaiyat ko maanate the
 In the Hollywood film Agora on this subject, it is shown that when the gupta-christians outnumbered Rome, they started insulting the Roman gods

 They prayed to worship Jesus and Mary, which sounded Buddhist mantras, but contained the words of the Bible
 ye isai prarthanaayen kakure-chrischiyanon ne ek peedi se duusari peedi ko maukhik rup se hastantarit kerani shuru kar di
 They worshiped a Buddha-like idol, which was actually that of Mother Mary
 1550 se le kar agle 400 saalon tak kakure isai buddha dharm ke chhadmaavaran main rahe
 In the 20th century, when Japan moved towards industrialization and Buddhist religious fundamentalism declined, these Kakure Christians came out of the facade of Buddhism to reveal their Christian identity

 Rumba is a term used for dancing with two completely different meanings
 sabase pehle iskaa arth he africa style kaa cubai aayojan, jo africa-cubai sangeet kii rumba style se judaa hua he
 There are several styles of this rumba, of which the Guaguanco style is the most common
 duusare, yah bollroom nrityon main se ek ko sanderbhit karata he jise saamaajik nrity tathaa antarrashtriya pratiyogitaaon main pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In this sense, the rumba dance is the slowest of the five competing international Latin dances: Paso Doble, Samba, cha-cha-cha and Jive
 is bollroom rumba nrity kaa pradarshan cuba main us taal par bhi kiya jaataa tha jise wo bolero-son kehete the; kranti se samay ke pehle cuba main nrity ke hue adhyayanon ke parinamswaroop antarrashtriya style janm hua
 In terms of rhythm and dance, the african-cuban rumba dance is completely different from the ballroom rumba

 Like Salsa and Mumbo the ballroom rumba's postures and music originate from Sone

 It is easy to understand how Rumba is a better name for ease of reference and marketing, despite being wrong; This is the reason why the term salsa was later used for the entire popular music of Cuban origin
 cuba ke sabhi saamaajik nrityon main pair par khadey ho kar kulhon ko hilaanaa shaamil he, haalanki salsa, jo ki tej nrity he, main shaayad hi is tathy par dhyaan jaataa he, dhimi gati ke bollroom rumba main yah adhik spasht he
 In general terms, the postures are brief and the dance is performed without any ups and downs
 kai mudraon main baajuon ke mukt prayog ke rup main yah style pramanik he
 The original postures of this dance originated from dances performed before the time of the revolution in Havana and have evolved since then

 In 1768, Father Basile automatically saw a meteorite coming to Earth at a place called Luce in France
 agle varsh usne paris kii vigyaan kii royal academi ke adhiveshan main is vrittant par ek lekh padhaa
 Not believing the account, the Academy appointed a commission to investigate the incident, reporting that Father Basile's account was misleading, stating that the body of the body had become somewhat glassy due to lightning
 This led to the confusion of Basile that these bodies are not part of the earth

 ulkapindon kaa mukhya vargeekaran unke sanghathan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Some bodies are mostly made of iron, nickel or alloys and some resemble stones made of silicate minerals
 pehle vargvaalon ko dhatvik or duusare vargvaalon ko aashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In addition, metallic and surprising substances are often found in the same quantity in some bodies, they are called metallic meteorites
 vastut: purnataya dhatvik or purnataya aashmik ulkpindon ke bich sabhi prakaar kii ant:sth jatiyon ke ulkapind paae jate hai jisase pindon ke varg kaa nirnay karnaa bahudhaa kathin ho jaataa he
 Depending on the structure, strains are made in all three classes
 aashmik pindon main do mukhya upbhed hai jinamein se ek ko kaundrite or duusare ko akundrite kehete hai
 The main feature of the first subclass is that some specific circular grains, called caudreule, are present in them
 jin pindon main kaundrul upasthit nahin rahete unhen akundrite kehete hai
 There are also two main strains in metallic meteorites which are called Ashtaniq and Shasthanik respectively
 ye naam pindon kii antarrachana vyakt karte hai or jaisaa in naamon se vyakt hota he, pehle vibhed ke pindon main dhatvik padaarth ke bandha ashtani aakaar main or duusare main shashthinik aakaar main vinyast hote hai
 This type of composition is called Vidmanstetter and it can be identified with great ease on the leaf page of the body
 dhatvashmik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upvarg hai jinhen krmanusaar pelesite or ardhdhathwik kehete hai
 The surprising part of the first subclass of these bodies is mainly made up of olivine minerals, which are often circular and are incorporated into a system of ferrous-nickel metals
 ardhdhathwik ulkapindon main mukhyat: piroxin or alp maatra main anaurthite felsapaar vidyaman hote hai
 It has been mentioned in the earlier case that meteorites are classified based on the primacy of metallic and astral organs
 kintu in pindon main rasinic tatwon or khanijon ke vitaran ke sambandh main koi sunishchit aadhaar prathit nahin hota
 Apart from the three main classes of meteorites, there are several subclasses, each with its own distinct mineral community

 From the point of view of mineral composition there are many differences in the characteristics of meteorites and rocks found in the earth

 In addition, there are many minerals that are not found in terrestrial rocks, but are found in meteorites
 inamen se pramukh oldemite or shribersite hai
 Both these minerals are not permanent in abundance of moisture and oxygen and hence are not found in global rocks
 inaki upasthiti se yah bodh hota he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti aise vaataavaran main hui jahaan bhumandal kii apeksha oxidikaran kii paristhitiyaan nune rahi hongi
 Astounding meteorites generally lack the abundance of pyroxene and olivine and lack of feldspar, making their organization similar to the superfamous rocks of the planet
 ulkapindon kii utpatti kaa vishay bahut hi vivaadaaspad he
 Several views have been proposed on this subject from time to time, in some of which they have been considered as part of Earth, Moon, Sun and Comet etc
 ek ati maanya mat ke anusaar inaki utpatti ek aise grah se hui jo ab purnataya vinasht ho gaya he
 In this view, it is imagined that in the beginning, there must have been a planet in the shape of Mars which was destroyed when it came very close to another big planet, or collided with another planet, due to which billions of small number Large blocks formed which are visible in meteorite form
 is mat ke anusaar dhatvik ulka us kalpit grah kaa kendriya bhaag tathaa aashmik ulka upree prishth nirupit karte hai
 Although this metaphor explains many symptoms of meteorites, many things remain an incomprehensible puzzle
 udaahranarth kuch dhatvik ulkapindon main ashtani rachana hoti he jo saadharantaya 800 degree centegrade taap par nasht ho jaati he
 It is believed that during the fission of that fictitious planet, there must have been more heat in it
 phir bhi yah samaj main nahin aata ki yah ashtani rachana vinasht hone se kaise bachi
 Similarly, there is also doubt as to where the iron came from in the Akundrite Awesome Meteor and how Kaunduyul was formed in the Kondrite Awesome Meteor
 ek anya mat main yah prastaavit kiya gaya he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti grahon ke saath saath ho hui, athwa yon kahana chahie ki soramandal evam samast khamandaleey padaartho kii utpatti ulkapindon se hi hui
 According to this fantasy, the primordial world was full of meteorites and in time, those bodies gathered in different masses and according to their maximum density, gasamic noharica, constellations and planets were born
 is kalpana kii ek badi truti yah prathit hoti he ki khamandal main upasthit ulkapind itani dur-dur chhitaraaye hue hai tathaa unka parsparik aakarshan itnaa ksheen he ki unke ekatra hokar badi raashi banane main atyadhik samay lagegaa
 But there is no doubt that once a sufficiently large amount of money is formed, it will be able to retain its power and will eventually increase its size by adding more bodies

 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or enzyme immunoassay was the first commonly used test for HIV, a highly sensitive test
 elisa pareekshan main vyakti ke serum ko 400 guna tanu kiya jaataa he or ek aisi plate par lagaaya jaataa he, jis par echivi antigen lage hote hai
 If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens
 is plate ko phir serum ke anya sabhi anshon ko hataane ke liye dho liya jaataa he
 a specially made secondary antibody - an antibody that binds to human antibodies - is then applied to the plate and then washed again

 The authors concluded that: 


the use of repeatedly reactive enzyme immunoassay followed by confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescent assay remains the standard method for diagnosing HIV-1 infection
 a large study of HIV testing in 752 U
S
 laboratories reported a sensitivity of 99
7% and specificity of 98
5% for enzyme immunoassay, and studies in U
S
 blood donors reported specificities of 99
8% and greater than 99
99%
 With confirmatory Western blot, the chance of a false-positive identification in a low-prevalence setting is about 1 in 250 000 
 The specificity rates reported here for cheap enzyme immunoassay screening tests indicate that about 15 out of 1000 positive HIV test results will be false positives
 pareekshan ke parinaam kii pushti se mithyaa sakaaraatmakataa kii sambhaavna antat 250,000 pareekshanon main 1 tak kam ho sakati he

 Because of the very high predictive value of these tests, the CDC recommends that the negative test result be considered conclusive evidence that the person is not infected with HIV
 vaastavik sankhyaayein parakshit janasamudaay ke anusaar bhinn ho sakati hai
 This is because the interpretation of any medical test initially depends on the status of the belief or the probability of the disease occurring or not
 saamanytah purv sambhaavna kaa anumaan pareekshan ke sthaan par yaa janasamudaay main rog kii ghatana kii jaankaree kaa prayog karke lagaaya jaataa he
 Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of all tests, including HIV tests, are done taking into consideration the prior probability of the disease and the accuracy of the method of testing, thereby establishing a new level of confidence as to whether a person has the disease or not
 
 As the rate of HIV infection in the population increases, the likelihood that a positive test accurately indicates HIV infection increases
 isi tarah se nakaaratmak anumaanit mulya echivi ghatana ke badhane ke saath ghat jaataa he
 In this way, positive tests in a high-risk community, such as those in very low-risk communities, such as those who often have unprotected anal-intercourse with unknown partners, are more likely to accurately represent HIV infection than in low-risk communities
