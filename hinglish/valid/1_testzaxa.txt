 Offshoring has become a controversial issue that has sparked a heated debate among economists, some of whom mix with the subject of free trade
 mukt vyapaar ke madhyam se ise mul or gantavy donon deshon ke liye laabhakaari mana ja rahaa he, jahaan gantavy desh ko rojgaar pradaan kiya jaataa he or mul desh ko kam laagat par maal or sevaayen uplabdh hoti hai
 This leads to an increase in the GDP of both countries
 or donon hi deshon main rojgaar ke avasar bad jate hai chunki mul desh main jin kamgaaron kii naukariyaan chhot gai hai, ve aise behatar rojgaar paa sakate hai jo unke desh ke liye apekshaakrit faaydemand he
 On the other hand, job losses and pay cuts in developed countries have sparked opposition to offshoring
 visheshgyon kaa tark he ki viksit deshon main kisi bhi nae rojgaar kii gunvattta khoi hui naukariyon se kam hai or kam vetan kii peshkash kii jaati he
 Economists opposing offshoring allege that manipulation of currency by the government and their central banks leads to differences in labor costs leading to the illusion of comparative advantage
 iske alaava, ve sanket dete hai viksit deshon main software ejeeniyar, lekhaakaar, radiologist or patrkaar jaise ucch-mulya vaali naukariyon vaale shikshit or unnat rup se prashikshit log bhi bharat or china jaise atyadhik shikshit or saste mazaduron dwaara visthapit kiye ja rahe hai
 On May 1, 2002, economist and former ambassador Ernest H
 Pregg presented evidence before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in China, stating that for example, China keeps its currency almost constant against the dollar, which is There is a violation of Rule 6 of the International Monetary Fund Agreement, which states that any country can achieve its position in order to gain an advantageous position in the market

 Economists such as Paul Craig Roberts claim that economists who are encouraging offshoring are making the mistake of understanding the difference between comparative advantage and absolute advantage
 aashcharya nahin ki kai america karypalak america main maujuuda berojgaare ke ghatate str kaa hawala dete hue use sakaaratmak pramaan maanate hai ki ofshoring na to america kamgaaron ke liye hanikaarak rahaa he or naa hi america ke liye
 It may be a matter of debate that one of the problems with the use of current unemployment data is that it does not take into account the declining employment figures
 adhik mahatvapurn baat yah he ki is tark-vitark main aaj se 10-20 varshon baad satat apatati outsorcing ke prabhaav par na to vichaar kiya gaya he or naa hi purvanumaan lagaaya gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye ubharate deshon main shram laagat main sambhavit vruddhi or unki aarthik avasthiti main parivartan, jaisaa ki pichley dashakon main japan or dakshin korea ke maamle main ho chukaa he
 The decline in employment in the manufacturing sector has generated considerable fear among workers in the industrial sector, although overall employment is increasing in many countries
 iskaa prabhaav ofshoring yaa videshi nivesh se kahin zyaada darshaya gaya he, phir bhi berojgaare kii tohamat inhen ke maathe madhi ja rahi he, kyonki audyogic samaaj se audyogikarnottar samaaj main hone vaale dhime parivartan kii apeksha bade ofshoring pariyojnaayen logon kii nazar main zyaada aane lagi hai
 phir bhi, 2000-2005 kii avadhi ke dauraan america main rojgaar-srijan dhimi or vetan vruddhi kam rahi thi
 kuch log ofshoring ko iske liye zimmedaar tehraate hai
 1970 ke baad se hi kul rojgaar ke pratishat ke rup main dderghaavadhik berojgaare main lagaataar vruddhi rahi he
 In 2003, long-term unemployment increased by 22% +
 march 2009 tak, berogari bime par rahane vaale 45

 Along with offshoring applications such as call centers, a debate has also erupted that this type of practice is severely damaging the quality of customer service and technical support that customers receive from companies
 kai companiyon ko graahak seva or takneekee sahaayta ke liye videshi karmiyon ke istemaal ke apane faisale ke liye janata kaa rosh sahanaa padaa he, jo adhikanshtah iske dwaara khadi hone vaali bhashaai samasya ke kaaran rahi he
 Although some countries have high level young, skilled workers who are able to speak English as their native language, their English skills have raised questions in North America
 adhikansh america janata dwaara outsorcing kii aalochana ke peeche ghatiya graahak seva or takneekee sahaayta se upji vah pratikriya he jo videshi kaamgaar americanyon ke saath vaartalap kaa prayaas karte samay pradaan kar rahe hai
 Some claim that under outsourcing, companies are losing control and visibility over their vast supply chain, leading to increased risk
 2005 main industry directions ink or electronics supplai chen association dwaara kiye gaye 121 electronics udyog ke sankhyikee surveykshan main paaya gaya ki 69% uttardaataaon ne kaha ki outsorcing shuru hone ke baad se, kam se kam 5 aapurti shrinkhalaaon par unka niyantran kam ho gaya he, jab ki 66% pradaataaon ne mahasoos kiya ki graahakon ke saath unka kul jokhim adhik yaa bahut adhik ho gaya he
 36% of providers responded that they now felt an increased risk of uncertainty compared to their uncertainty before outsourcing
 62% uttardaataaon ne kam se kam do pramukh vyapaar saajhedaari prabandhan vyavhaar ko "samasyatmak" rup main varnit kiya, jinamein shaamil hai nishpaadan prabandhan or parinaamon par saamaanya sahmati
 is anusandhan ke anusaar, kul uttardaataaon ke 40% ko outsource saajhedaari samjhaute main jokhim saajha karne par pratirodh rahaa
 Transfer of knowledge outside the country may also create a competitor against the parent companies themselves
 chini vinirmaataa pichley gharelu madhyavartiyon ke madhyam se gaye bina, jinke saath unhone apni sevaaon ke liye anubandh kiya tha, pehle se hi videshi graahakon ko apana maal sidhe bechney lage hai
 In the 1990s and 2000s, American auto makers increasingly moved to China to manufacture parts for their vehicles
 2006 tak, china ne yah takanic bhalee-bhaanti hasil kar lee or ghoshit kar diya ki ab ve america auto nirmaataaon ke saath unheen ke gharelu bazaar main america logon ko chini automobile kii bikri karte hue pratispardhaa karenge
 When a company produces goods and services in another country, the investment it makes in the domestic market gets transferred to the foreign market
 korporate dhan jo kaarkaanon, prashikshan or karon main vyay hota he, vah company ke bazaar main kharch hone ke bajaay videshi bazaar main vyay ho jaataa he
 As production increases in the overseas market, qualified and experienced domestic workers leave, or are forced to lose their jobs, while many times they have to permanently leave the industry
 kisi charan par, naatakeey rup se kaary nishpadit karne ke liye bahut kam yogya gharelu shramik baaqi rah jate hai
 This causes the domestic market to depend on the foreign market for goods and services that strategically weaken the "hollow" home country
 vastav main, ofshoring videsh ke pratispardhi udyogon ko taiyaar or majboot karata he, jab ki ranneetik rup se swadesh ko kamazor banaata he
 However, employment data cast doubt on this claim
 udhaaharan ke liye, haal hi main america main IT rojgaar 2001 ke pehle vaale str tak aa gaya he or tab se bad rahaa he
 The number of jobs lost due to offshoring has been less than 1 percent of the entire US labor market
 heritage foundation dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan ke anusaar, outsorcing america main chhootane vaali naukariyon ke ek bahut chote se anupaat kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The total number of jobs left due to offshoring, both construction and technical, represents only 4 percent of the jobs left in the US
 naukariyon kii katautee ke pramukh kaaran anubandh samaapan or karmchaariyon kii sankhya ko ghataya janaa he
 Some economists and commentators claim that the case of offshoring is being exaggerated
 ofshoring ke kaaran naukari khone vaale deshiy karmchaariyon ke liye aksar prastut ek samaadhaan he nai naukari ke liye punah prashikshan
 kuch visthapit karmchaaree ucch shiksha or snaatak yogyata praapt hai

 ofshoring in karkon main se kinhi do kii gatishiltaa par kaaphi nirbhar karata he
 That is, how offshoring affects economies depends on how easily capital and labor can be used for a different purpose
 utpaadan ke ek kaarak ke rup main bhoomi main aam taur par kam yaa gatishiltaa kii koi sambhavyata nahin dekhi jaati he
 The effect of capital mobility on offshoring has been widely discussed
 vyashti-arthshaastra main, ek nigam ko ofshoring ke praarambhik laagat ko vahan karne ke liye kaaryshil puunji ko kharch karne kii kshamta honi chahie
 If the government heavily regulates how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations
 isi vajah se ofshoring kii safalataa ke liye samshti-arthshaastra ko mukt hona chahie
 Generally, those who favor offshoring support capital mobility and those who oppose offshoring seek excessive regulation
 shram gatishiltaa bhi ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaati he or is par bhi garma-garam bahes hoti he
 When computers and the Internet made work electronically portable, the forces of free market resulted in the global mobility of work in the service industry
 Most theories that argue offshoring ultimately benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new employment, whether they are employed by devaluing themselves or by retraining themselves in a new field
 One had to go back to the labor market to get it
 Foreign workers get the benefit of new jobs and higher wages when work comes to them
 viksit vishwa main, desh se baahar naukariyon ko le jane kaa maamla kam se kam 1960 ke dashak main dekha gaya or tab se yah jari he

 During the 20th century, the reduction in transportation and communication costs, along with major disparities of payment rates, made it economically feasible for many companies to offshore from rich countries to less wealthy countries

 With the development of the Internet, many new categories of tasks such as call centers, computer programming, offshoring of medical data such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging, medical transcription, income tax preparation and title search have begun
 1990 ke dashak se pehle, ireland europea sangh ke sabase garib deshon main se ek tha

 Often they are called 'ministers' but sometimes they are also called 'secretaries'
 cabinet, england kii shashan vyavastha se viksit shashan-vyavastha kaa pramukh evam mahatvapurn ang he
 It is practiced in almost all countries which are members of the British Commonwealth
 kuch anya deshon main bhi yah vyavastha prachlit he
 It is also part of the central and territorial government of India
 saamaanya rup main sansad kii loksabhaa main jis dal kaa bahumat ho yaa jo bahumat praapt kar saktaa ho, us dal yaa dalon ke samooh ke sadasyon main se chune hue raajnneetigyon kaa yah ek nikaay he
 It is not elected by the House, instead they are nominated by the Prime Minister or Chief Minister
 loksabhaa ke dwaara janamat sarkaar par niyantran rakhata he or apane bahumat dwaara loksabhaa sarkaar par niyantran rakhti he
 But the government is a governance body larger than the cabinet
 sarkaar main mantri, parlamentary sachiv aadi ve sab sammilit hai jinaki karyavadhi raajnneetik he
 The cabinet is a small community of relatively important ministers who decide and decide policy in all important matters regarding the governance of the country
 iskaa aakaar sarkaar ke vividh vibhaagon ke kaarybhaar ke anusaar ghatata badhata or desh-desh main badalata rahata he
 All members of the cabinet are members of Parliament or it is mandatory for them to be elected members only after a short time of appointment
 bharat main kabhi-kabhi vidhaan parishad main sarkaar dwaara manonith sadasyon ko bhi mantrimandal main le liya jaataa he par yah apwaad swaroop hi
 The government can remain in office only as long as it has the strength of majority in the Lok Sabha
 yadi kisi mahatvapurn samasya par uski paraajay ho jaae yaa vah vyavasthapika sabha kaa vishwaas kho de to uske liye padatyag karnaa aavashyak he
 The responsibility of the cabinet has been reduced due to the well-organized and rigid discipline of the parties
 shasit hone ke sthaan par cabinet bahumat ke dwaara vyavasthapika sabha par shashan karti he; tathaapi janata ke man ko abhivyakt karne ke manch ke naate, loksabhaa kaa mahatv bana hua he
 But it is seen that public opinion has more direct control over the cabinet
 cabinet ko vyavasthapika sabha ke prati apil kaa adhikaar he- duusare shabdon main sabha ko bhang karne kaa adhikaar he
 However, this right is used to take advantage of the favorable wave of public opinion on a particular occasion or to conduct general elections before a certain time
 cabinet pranali main mahatvapurn sthiti pradhanmantri kii he
 In Laski's words, he is higher than the higher officials but less than the autocratic ruler

 a nominated person is required to be able to get his / her colleagues or to form a valid government in the Lok Sabha
 saamanyat: bahumatvaale dal ke maane hue netaa ko sarkaar banane ke liye nimantrit kiya jaataa he
 There is no question of interest of the legal head
 kintu vishesh paristhitiyon main vaidhanik pradhan simit nirnay kaa hi prayog kar saktaa he
 This happens when the Prime Minister retires or resigns, or when no one party is in majority in the Lok Sabha or on the occasion of national crisis, when a government generally mixed with one party is considered better
 kintu aisi avasthaaon main bhi vaidhanik pradhan kaa nirnay niyantrit hi hota he
 It is necessary for the nominated person to be in such a situation that he can form a government which can get the support of the administrator
 cabinet ke sadasyon se sarvatra apeksha kii jaati he ki ve sanyukt rup main kaam karen
 He should present himself in a united form to the administrator, to the country and to the legal head

 All members are expected to approve all cabinet decisions, if necessary, by speech and vote

 The symbol of the unity of the cabinet and the main source in contacting the legal head, the Prime Minister has the right to seek resignation from a colleague and to keep the unity of the cabinet intact
 cabinet pranali vahaan adhik safaltaapurvak kaam karti he jahaan do susangathit dal hon- ek sattarudh ho ore doosraa virodh main ho or yah anubhav kare ki yadi sarkaar kaa patan hua to sarkaar chalaane kaa uttardaayitv usapar aa saktaa he
 Therefore, he inaugurated the weaknesses of governance with full responsibility
 virdohi paksh aalochana ke liye aalochana main nahin padataa, pratyut shashan kaa sudhaar karne ke vichaar se ore janamat ko apane paksh main karne ke liye taaki nirvaachakon se duusare avasar par apil karne main safalataa praapt kare
 This form of the opposing party is recognized in the United Kingdom and is as much an important part of the governance apparatus as the majority party
 parinamat: vah 'har magesti' ke virdohi dal ke naam se pukaara jaataa he or uske netaa ko manyataprapt janaseva kaa uttardaayitvapurn dhang se nirvaah karne ke liye sarkari khajaane se niyamit vetan miltaa he
 This tradition has also been adopted in India and the leader of the opposition receives the same salary as a minister
 cabinet sarkaar vahaan sthaayee nahin ho paati jahaan dalon kaa bahulya ho athwa jahaan aise samooh hon jinhen 'splinter grups' kaha jaataa he
 Although cabinet rule developed in England, it was not created by any law there

 The 'ministers of the Crown Act', which was created in 1937, has only an explanation of who will be the minister in the cabinet

 To understand the cabinet system, we have to consider the restoration of 1660 AD, according to which the form of dominion was that of the king, but the actual governance was transferred to the power parlance
 charles dwitiya ne pachaas sadasyon kii privi concil ko mahatvapurn maamalon main gopneeyata ke saath furti se kaam nipataane main aksham dekhakar mantriyon ke us chote se samooh par nirbhar rahanaa aarambh kiya jo uske vishwasabhajan the or parlment main apane paksh ko prabal karne kaa jodtod tak sakate the
 These people would meet the king in a small closed chamber or cabinet
 kintu 17veen shatabdi main cabinet parlment dwaara andeh kii drushti se dekha jaataa rahaa
 William III accepted the advice of the Earl of Sunderland in the last days of his reign and in 1692 elected his ministers from only one party

 People called this cabinet 'janda' because it worked secretly and like a group
 parlment ne iske prati bahut asantosh vyakt kiya- unhen dand nahin diya ja saktaa kyonki unke kaamon kaa pataa nahin chalata
 As a result, by 1710 AD, the matter of one-party cabinet could not be fully implemented
 maharani ain ke shashan ke antim varshon main hi cabinet pranali kii disha main kuch pragati hui
 Ministers would meet in the office of the Senior Secretary of State in the White Hall, whenever needed for consultation and decision-making in all government functions, and usually present the Queen's Cabinet once a week, with the Rajajaj and his decision
 Let him know
 privi kaunsilon ke adhiveshnon main keval aupchaarik kaamkaaj hote
 However, keeping in mind the possibility of a subsequent investigation, the Ministers had taken wise precautions to present the contentious matter to the Privy Cousil and obtain its formal decision thereon

 When Raja started to be absent in the conventions of the cabinet, then the responsibility of the cabinet fell on the Prime Minister and then the actual institution of the cabinet was born
 1721-42 main rabart walpol ne sattarudh hone par apana sammanneey pad sthapit karne or shashan kii saamaanya niti nirdhaarit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya
 They formed a united front in front of the King and Parliament, with the support of their allies, and forced allies such as Townsend and Chesterton not to support their policy
 unhone is baat kaa aagrah kiya ki mantriyon kaa chunaav unpar chhod diya jaae
 He ruled with the support of the Parliament, but by then the organization and discipline of the parties had not developed, he had to use his force and protection and had to take bribe and corruption to take possession of the Parliament
 kintu jab 1742 main unhone parlament kaa avlamb nahin mil paaya to unhone pad tyaag kar diya ore house of kaamans main rajit hone par mantrimandal dwaara padatyag karne kii parampara kii sthapana kii or pit ne house ov kaamans ke viruddh pradhanmantri dwaara nirvaachakon se apil kar sakane kii parampara sthapit kii
 But when constitutional rule was established over the long period of the reign of Queen Victoria, the rule of modern cabinet system gradually stabilized

 keshav yaa keshavadas 1555 vikrami or mrityu 1618 vikrami) hindi sahitya ke reetikaal kii kavi-trayee ke ek pramukh stambh hai
 He is an ancient Acharya and poet of Hindi who has given a proper introduction to Sanskrit poetry
 inkaa janm sanadhy brahman kul main hua tha
 His father's name was Kashiram, who was a special affection of Odchanaresh Madhukarshah
 madhukarshah ke putr maharaj indrajit singh inke mukhya ashrayadata the
 He considered Keshav as his guru
 rasikapriya ke anusaar keshav orcha rajtargat tungarai ke nikat betwa nadi ke kinare sthit orcha nagar main rahete the
 Acharya Keshavdas was born in 1546 AD in Orchha
 ve sanay brahman the
 His father's name was Pt Kashinath
 orchha ke rajdurbar main unke parivaar kaa bada maan tha
 Keshavdas himself was the court poet, minister and guru of Indrajeet Singh, brother of Orchha Naresh Maharaj Ramsingh
 indrajit singh kii ore se inhen ikkis gaanv mili hue the
 He lived a luxurious life with self-respect
 keshavadas sanskrit ke udbhat vidwaan the
 Sanskrit was also promoted in his family
 naukar-chaakar bhi sanskrit bolte the
 In his family too, leaving Sanskrit and poetry in Hindi language, he found it somewhat humiliating - keshav bade bhavuk or rasik vyakti the
 It is said that once in old age he was sitting at a well
 vahaan pani bharne ke liye ai hui kuch striyon ne unhen baba kahkar sambodhan kiya
 On this, he said the following couplet - samvath 1608 ke lagbhag jahangir ne orchha kaa rajya vir singh dev ko de diya
 Keshav stayed in the court of Veer Singh for some time, then went to the Gangat and started living there
 1618 isvi main unka dehavsaan ho gaya
 The nine authentic texts composed by Keshavdas are: Rasikapriya, Kavipriya, Nakhshikh, Chandmala, Ramachandrika, Veerasinghdeva Charit, Ratanbavani, Vigyanagita and Jahangir Jaschandrika
 rasikapriya keshav kii praudh rachana he jo kavyashastra sambandhi granth hai
 Symptoms of rasa, vritti and kavyadoshas are given in it
 iske mukhya aadhargranth hai - naatyashaastra, kamasutra or rudrabhatt kaa shringartilak
 Kavipriya is a poetry-related treatise which was presented for Indrajit Singh's Rakshita and Keshav's disciple Pravinaray
 yah kaviklpaltavriti or kavyadarsh par aadhaarit he
 Ramachandrika is his most famous epic, in which the content has been taken from many texts like Prasannaraghava, Hanumannakataka, Kadambari etc
 ratanbavanee main madhukarshah ke putr ratansen, veerasingh charit main indrajeetsingh ke anuj veerasingh tathaa jahangir jaschandrika kaa yashogaan kiya gaya he
 There is non-scriptural poetry based on Prabodh Chandrodaya in Vigyangeetha
 keshav alankaar sampradaiwaadee acharya kavi the
 Therefore it was natural that they would follow the Acharyas of the Alankar sect like Bhamah, Uddhat and Dandi
 inhone alankaaron ke do bhed maane hai, saadhaaran or vishisht
 Under the ordinary description, Variya, Bhumishree-narration and Rajyashree-narration, which are based on poetic imagery and ornamentation
 is tarah ve alankaarya or alankaar main bhed nahin maanate
 Due to a special interest in ornaments, the poetic aspect has been suppressed and these are generally not considered to be gentle poets
 apni clishtataa ke kaaran ye kathin kavy ke pret kahe gaye hai
 Specific management is not excellent in terms of Ramachandrika management, identification of poignant places, nature description etc
 parampara paalan tathaa adhikadhik alankaaron ko samavisht karne ke kaaran varnanon kii bharmaar he
 In the description of chahal-pahal, Nagar Shobha, Decoration etc
, he has more mood
 sanvaadon kii yojana main, naatakeey tatwon ke sannivesh ke kaaran, inhen vishesh safalataa mili he
 Their simplicity has been expressed at more places in the Muktakas than in the arrangements
 keshav darbari kavi the
 Like other courtly poets, they have also celebrated their refugee kings
 vir singh dev charit or jahangir jas chandrika unki aisi hi rachanaaen hai
 The second form of Keshava is that of Acharya
 kavi-priya or rasik-priya main inhone sanskrit ke lakshan, granthon kaa anuwaad kiya or udhaaharan swaroop apni kavitaaon kii rachana kii
 The theme of Ram Chandrika is Rama-bhakti but Keshava poets were first, devotees later
 atah unamem bhakthi-bhaavana kii apeksha kavy-chamatkaar ke pradarshan kii bhaavana adhik he
 In the Science Gita, Keshav expresses feelings related to asceticism
 rajdarbaron kii saaj-sajja ke bich rahane ke kaaran keshav kii pravriti prakruti main nahin rahi
 His nature-portrayal is flawed
 usamen parampara kaa nirvaad adhik he, moulikta or naveenta kam
 Keshav has not even taken care of time and place in narrating
 alankaaron ke boj se dabi prakruti apana sahan saundarya kho baithi he
 Keshav's fantasies regarding nature have become very inconsistent and uninteresting at some places
 arun surya ko kapalik kaal kaa rakt se bharaa kapaal bana dena kase kaa chakar prathit hoga - Being a court poet, the eloquence of the courts was present in Keshav
 atah sanvaadon kii yojana main unhen asaadhaaran safalataa mili
 His dialogues are very attractive
 unamem rajdarbaron jaisi haazir-javaabi or shishtataa he
 The characters are inaugurated beautifully by them
 janak-vishwamitra samvaad, lav-kush samvaad, sita-hanuman samvaad isi prakaar ke samvaad hai
 See an answer and answer under 'angad-ravana-dialogue' - ravan- Angad- acharya keshavadas ucchkoti ke vidwaan the
 Therefore, there is more yoga in his poetry and imagination
 unka dhyaan jitna paanditya-pradarshan kii ore tha utana bhav-pradarshan kii ore nahin
 Due to this trend of erudition, some critics have called Keshav a heartless poet, but this allegation is not completely true, because along with the performance of erudition, there are many places in Keshav's poetry where his sentimentality and warm-heartedness came true
 is
 ashok vatika main hanuman ji sita ji ko ramchandra ji kii mudrika dete hai
 How expressive Sita ji's statement towards the ring is- keshav ne apane kavy kaa madhyam brajabhasha ko banaaya, parantu brajabhasha kaa jo dhalaa hua rup sur aadi asht chhap ke kaviyon main miltaa he vah keshav kii kavita main nahin
 Keshav was a Sanskrit scholar, so his language is heavily influenced by Sanskrit
 unhone sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon ko hi nahin, sanskrit kii vibhaktiyon ko bhi apanaaya he, kahin-kahin to unke chhandon kii bhashaa sanskrit hi jaan padati he- There is also a lot of mixture of Bundelkhandi language in Keshav's language
 khaarak, thorila, dugai, gauramadine aadi jaise bundeli shabdon kaa prayog baraabar unke kavy main hua
 Words of the period language are also used
 jaise - ihaan, uhaan, dikhau, rijhaau aadi
 Keshav has coined the words at some places
 jaise - chaap se chaapkeey
 Even in the use of obsolete words, he worked with complete freedom
 jaise - alok, laanch, nari aadi
 The use of the word poison in the meaning of water is found only in the language of Keshava - sanskrit or bundelkhandi ke atyadhik prabhaav, lambii-lambii shabd-yojana aprachlit shabdon ke prayog aadi ke kaaran keshav kii bhashaa main kahin-kahin atyant vilshtataa aa gai he
 The general form of Keshav's language is relatively intelligible
 usamen kahawaton or muhaavaron kaa bhi yatha-sthaan prayog hua he
 Look at the use of the phrase Lajna die - keshav kii style par unke vyaktitv kii chhap spasht drushtigochar hoti he is sambandh main unhone apane kisi purv kavi kaa anusaran nahin kiya
 His poetry can be easily identified among the poems of many poets
 sankshep main keshav kii style praudh or gambhir he
 Because of erudition, she has become somewhat arrogant
 keshav das ji ne apane kavy main anek sthalon par vividh rason kii utkrisht vyanjana kii he, kintu mukhyatah ve shringaar or vir ras ke kavi hai
 They have adopted both sides of the makeup
 virochit utsaah ke maarmik varnan main to ve apni sani nahin rakhte
 How encouraging is Kush's statement to Sita, lamenting Shatrughan's arrows for unconscious love
 chhandon ke vishay keshav kaa gyaan apaar tha
 No one in Hindi literature has used all the types of verses
 ramchandrika main to chhandon kii vividhta is seemaa tak pahunch gai he ki vidwaanon ne use shabdon kaa ajaayabaghar kah diya he
 Keshav himself wrote - keshav kii chand yojana sanskrit sahitya kii chand yojana he
 He has also successfully used verses like Kavita, Savaiya, Doha etc
 keshav ko alankaaron se vishesh moh tha unke anusaar - Hence, the use of different figures of speech in his poetry appears everywhere
 alankaaron ke boj se kavita ke bhav dab se gaye hai or pathak ko keval chamatkaar haath lagata he
 Where Keshav does not have a strong request for the alankar-yojana, his poetry is extremely heartwarming and succulent
 upama-alankaar kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- dasharath-maran ke uparaant bharat jab mahal main pravesh karte hai to ve maataaon ko vriksh viheen lataaon ke samaan pate hai
 Keshav Dasji is the first teacher of Hindi literature
 hindi main sarv pratham unhone hi kavy ke vibhinn angon kaa shastreey paddati se vivechan kiya
 It is fitting that in his poetry, the art aspect is more important than the emotional aspect and because of his erudition, he is called as the phantom of difficult poetry, but his importance does not disappear at all
 acharya ramchandra shukla ke shabdon main keshav kii rachana main sur, tulsi aadi kii si saralata or tanmayata chaahe na ho par kavyangon kaa vistrut parichay kara kar unhone aage ke liye maarg kholaa
 Keshavdas ji was virtually a great poet
 sur or tulsi ke pashchaat hindi-kavy-jagat main unheen kii hi gananaa kii jaati he- a Picture from Rasikapriya, 1610 chitra rasikapriya se, 1610 Intrusive igneous rocks are igneous rocks that are formed by rising above the magma and freezing below the ground surface
 inhen pataliya shailen bhi kaha jaataa he
 They are often cold and often have a cold structure due to freezing

 inaki vishwa bhar main 44 jeevvaigyanik jatiyaan hai jinamein 12 jatiyaan bharat main pai jaati hai
 They have a lifespan of about 6 years in the forest, but their life in captivity can be up to 15 years
 parabhakshiyon kii vajah se shavakon kii mrityu dar kaafii unchi hoti he
 Often this creature is nocturnal

 It jumps from one tree to another to spread its legs and goes as far as flying birds and birds, but it glides by spreading its legs, not flying
 bharat main udan gilahari kii 12 jatiyaan pai jaati hai jo is prakaar hai: Apart from the above 10 castes, recently two more castes have been found in India which are as follows: - paudhe kaa vah bhaag jo bhumi ke upar bhrun ke prankur se viksit hokar prithvi ke gurutvakarshan ke vipareet prakaash kii ore badhata he, tana kehalaata he
 It produces branches, leaves, flowers and fruits

 dow radhakrishnan kaa janm tamilnadu ke tirutani gram main, jo tatkaaleen madras se lagbhag 64 ki me kii duuri par sthit he, 5 sitambar 1888 ko hua tha
 The family he was born into was a Brahmin family
 unka janm sthaan bhi ek pavitra tirthasthal ke rup main vikhyath rahaa he
 Radhakrishnan's ancestors had previously lived in a village called 'sarvepalli' and in the mid-18th century they had migrated towards the village of Tirutani
 lekin unke purakhe chaahate the ki unke naam ke saath unke janmasthal ke gram kaa bodh bhi sadaiv rahanaa chaiye
 That is why his family started wearing 'sarvapalli' before his name
 dow radhakrishnan ek garib kintu vidwaan brahman kii santaan the
 His father's name was 'sarvepalli Veeraswamy' and mother's name was 'sitamma'
 unke pita rajasav vibhaag main kaam karte the
 He was responsible for the maintenance of a very large family
 veeraswami ke paanch putr tathaa ek putree thi
 Radhakrishnan's place was second among these descendants
 unke pita kaafii kathinaayee ke saath parivaar kaa nirvahan kar rahe the
 Due to this, the child Radhakrishnan did not get any special pleasure in childhood
 radhakrishnan kaa balykaal tirutani evam tirupati jaise dharmik sthalon par hi vyateet hua
 He spent the first eight years in Tirutani
 yadhyapi unke pita puraane vichaaron ke the or unamem dharmik bhavanaayen bhi thim, iske baavjood unhone radhakrishnan ko chrishchiyan mishanri sanstha luthern mishan skool, tirupati main 1896-1900 ke madhya vidyadhyayan ke liye bheja
 Then for the next 4 years he was educated in Vellore
 iske baad unhone madras chrishchiyan college, madras main shiksha praapt kii
 He was brilliant since childhood
 in 12 varshon ke adhyayan kaal main radhakrishnan ne bible ke mahatvapurn ansh bhi yaad kar liye
 For this, he was awarded the honor of special merit
 is umr main unhone vir saavarkar or swami vivekananda kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 He passed the matriculation level examination in 1902 and also received a scholarship
 iske baad unhone 1904 main kala sankaay pariksha pratham shrenee main uteern kii
 He also received special merit remarks in psychology, history and mathematics due to his high scores
 iske alaava chrishchiyan college, madras ne unhen chaatravrutti bhi di
 After doing his MA in Philosophy in 1916, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Madras Residency College
 baad main usee college main ve praadhyaapak bhi rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan introduced the Indian philosophy to the world through his writings and speeches
 saare vishwa main unke lekhon kii prashansa kii gayi
 At that time, in the Brahmin families of Madras, marriage was completed at an early age and Radhakrishnan was no exception
 1903 main 16 varsh kii aayu main hi unka vivaah dur ke rishte kii bahan 'sivaakamu' ke saath sampann ho gaya
 At that time his wife was only 10 years old
 atah teen varsh baad hi unki patni ne unke saath rahanaa armbh kiya
 Although his wife Sivakamu was not traditionally educated, he had good authority over the Telugu language
 vah angrezi bhashaa bhi likh-pard sakati thim
 In 1908, the Radhakrishnan couple received a daughter as a child
 1908 main hi unhone kala snaatak kii oopaadhi pratham shrenee main praapt kii or darshan shaastra main vishisht yogyata praapt kii
 In 1909, after six years of marriage, he also passed the postgraduate examination in Arts
 inkaa vishay darshan shaastra hi rahaa
 He also continued to teach tuition to children for his personal income during higher studies
 1908 main unhone em0 e0 kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye ek shodh lekh bhi likhaa
 At this time, he was only twenty years old
 isse shastron ke prati unki gyaan-pipaasa badi
 Soon he also studied Vedas and Upanishads deeply
 iske atirikt unhone hindi or sanskrit bhashaa kaa bhi ruchipurvak adhyayan kiya
 While education definitely has an impact on every individual, the quality of an educational institution also leaves an impact
 chrishchiyan sansthaaon dwaara us samay pashchimi jivan mulyon ko vidhyaarthiyon ke bheetar kaaphi gaharaai tak sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 This is the reason that while studying in Christian institutions, Radhakrishnan's life had high qualities
 lekin unamem ek anya parivartan bhi aayaa jo ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon ke kaaran hi tha
 Some people used to view Hindutva ideas and criticize them
 unki aalochana ko dow radhakrishnan ne chunauti kii tarah liya or hindu shastron kaa gaharaa adhyayan karnaa armbh kar diya
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan wanted to know that in which culture ideas really are conscious and in which culture ideas are rooted? Then by natural intuition started to believe strongly that the poor and illiterate people living in remote places of India also knew the ancient truth
 is kaaran radhakrishnan ne tulanaatmak rup se yah jaan liya ki bhartiya aadhyatm kaafii samrudh he or chrishchiyan mishnariyon dwaara hindutv kii aalochanaayen niraadhaar hai
 From this he concluded that Indian culture is based on religion, knowledge and truth which gives the true message of life to the creature
 dow radhakrishnan ne yah bhalee bhanti jaan liya tha ki jivan bahut hi chota he parantu isamen vyaapt khushiyaan anishchit hai
 For this reason, a person should live happily and comfortably
 vastutah mrityu ek atal sachai he, jo amir garib sabhi ko apana grass banaati he tathaa kisi prakaar kaa varg bhed nahin karti
 True knowledge is the only one who can eliminate the ignorance inside you
 sadgipurn santoshavritti kaa jivan amiron ke ahamkaari jivan se behatar he, jinamein asantosh kaa nivas he
 a quiet mind is better than those thunderous applause; Which are heard in parliaments and courts
 vastut: isi kaaran dow radhakrishnan bhartiya samskruti ke naitik mulyon ko samaj paane main safal rahe, kyonki ve mishnariyon dwaara kii gai aalochanaon ke satya ko swayan parakhnaa chaahate the
 That is why criticisms are said to be acts of purification
 sabhi matayen apane bacchon main ucch sanskaar dekhnaa chaahati hai
 For this reason, they teach children how to believe in God, stay away from sin and help those who are in trouble
 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah bhi janaa ki bhartiya samskruti main sabhi dharmon kaa aadar karnaa sikhaaya gaya he or sabhi dharmon ke liye samta kaa bhav bhi hindu samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan he
 Thus he understood the specific identity of Indian culture and became very close to it
 dow radhakrishnan samooche vishwa ko ek vidhyalay maanate the
 He believed that only through education can the human mind be properly utilized
 at: vishwa ko ek hi ikai maanakar shiksha kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 In his speech at the University of Edinburgh, UK, Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said - "man should be one
 maanav itihaas kaa sampurna lakshya maanav jati kii mukti tabhi sambhav he jab deshon kii nitiyon kaa aadhaar puure vishwa main shaanti kii sthapana kaa praytn ho
 "dr
 Radhakrishnan used to enchant the students with his wit-filled explanations, joyful expressions and mildly tickling stories
 ucch naitik mulyon ko apane aacharan main utaarne kii prerana vah apane chaatro ko bhi dete the
 Whatever subject he taught, he himself studied it deeply
 darshan jaise gambheer vishay ko bhi vah apni style se saral, rochak or priy bana dete the
 In 1909, at the age of 21, Dr
 Radhakrishnan started teaching philosophy as a junior lecturer in Madras Presidency College
 yah unka param saubhaahgya tha ki unako apni prakruti ke anukool aajeevika praapt hui thi
 Here he not only did teaching work for 7 years but also studied Indian philosophy and Indian religion deeply
 un dinon vyaakhyaata ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki adhyaapan hetu vah shikshan kaa prashikshan bhi praapt kare
 That is why in 1910 Radhakrishnan started taking training in Madras
 is samay inkaa vetan maatr 37 rupee tha
 Radhakrishnan, the then Professor of Philosophy Department, was greatly overwhelmed by the philosophy of classical knowledge
 unhone unhen darshan shaastra kii kakshaon se anupasthit rahane kii anumati pradaan kar di
 But instead, it was conditioned that he should teach in philosophy classes instead
 tab radhakrishna ne apane kaksha saathiyon ko teraa aise prabhaavshaalee vyaakhyaan diye, jinase ve shikshaarthi bhi chakit rah gayi
 The reason for this was that he had a deep grip on the subject, his approach to philosophy was clear and he had also chosen the appropriate words while giving lectures
 1912 main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan kii "manovigyaan ke aavashyak tatv" sheershak se ek laghu pustika bhi prakashit hui jo kaksha main diye gayi unke vyakhyanon kaa sangrah tha
 This qualification was proved by this booklet that "not only do they have a rich store of words to explain every verse, their memory power is also very unique
 " When Dr
 Radhakrishnan returned to India from Europe and America, then various universities here honored him by awarding him honorary degrees
 1928 kii sheet ritu main inaki pratham mulaaqaat pandit jawahar laal nehru se us samay hui, jab vah congress party ke vaarshik adhiveshan main sammilit hone ke liye kalakatta aae hue the
 Although Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan could not participate in any political discourse as a member of the Indian Educational Service, he did not care for this taboo and gave a speech
 1929 main inhen vyaakhyaan dene hetu 'maanchester vishvavidhyalay' dwaara aamantrit kiya gaya
 He gave many lectures in Manchester and London
 inaki shiksha sambandhi uplabdhiyon ke daayre main nimnavat sansthanik seva kaaryon ko dekha jaataa he- Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did the same and put his address to rest at 12 o'clock at night
 pandit nehru or radhakrishnan ke alaava kisi anya ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi
 After independence, he was requested to fulfill diplomatic work with the Soviet Union as a distinguished ambassador to serve the motherland
 is prakaar vijayalakshmi pandit kaa inhen nayaa uttaradhikari chunaa gaya
 Pandit Nehru's selection prompted many to wonder why a philosopher was chosen for diplomatic services? He suspected that the abilities of Dr
 Radhakrishnan were not compatible with the responsibility assigned to him
 lekin baad main sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah sabit kar diya ki moscow main niyukt bhartiya rajanyikon main ve sabase behatar the
 He was a non-traditional diplomat
 jo mantranaayen der raatri hoti thim, ve unamem raatri 10 baje tak hi bhaag lete the, kyonki uske baad unke shayan kaa samay ho jaataa tha
 Even when Radhakrishnan was a teacher, he was not bound by rules
 kaksha main yah 20 minute deree se aate the or das minute purv hi chale jate the
 They said that the lectures they had to give in class were completed in enough time of 20 minutes
 iske uparant bhi yah vidhyaarthiyon ke priy evam aadarneey shikshak bane rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was elected Vice President after his arrival from the Soviet Union in 1952
 samvidhan ke antargat uparashtrapati kaa nayaa pad srujit kiya gaya tha
 Nehru again surprised the people by choosing Radhakrishnan for this post
 unhen aashcharya tha ki is pad ke liye congress party ke kisi raajnneetijna kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Radhakrishnan also served as the Speaker in the Rajya Sabha as Vice President
 san 1952 main ve bharat ke uparashtrapati banaaye gayi
 Later this selection of Pandit Nehru also proved to be meaningful, because a non-politician as Vice President influenced all politicians
 sansad ke sabhi sadasyon ne unhen unke kaary vyavhaar ke liye kaafii saraahaa
 People still remember his generosity, perseverance and humorous nature
 hamaare desh ke dwitiya kintu adwitiya raashtrapati dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ke janm din ko prativarsh 'shikshak diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, awards are also given to the best teachers in the entire country by the Government of India
 yadhyapi unhen 1931 main british samrajya dwaara "sar" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gayi thi lekin swatantrata prapti ke pashchaat uskaa auchity dow radhakrishnan ke liye samaapt ho chukaa tha
 When he became the vice-president, the first President of independent India, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad ji, in 1954 gave him the country's highest decoration Bharat Ratna for his great philosophical and educational achievements

 raatri main ye aayan yaa electron phir paraspar milakar anu yaa parmaanu main parinat ho jate hai jisase raatri ke prakaash ke varnapat main hari or laal rekhaayen dikhaai padati hai
 The gaseous mantle that wraps around the earth in a thickness of hundreds of km is called the atmosphere
 vayumandal vibhinn gaison kaa mishran he jo prithvi ko chaaro ore se ghere hue he
 At lower levels the composition of the atmosphere remains relatively uniform
 oonchaai main gaison kii aapekshik maatra main parivartan paaya jaataa he
 Nitrogen 78 percent, oxygen, 21 percent, argon 0
93 percent carbon dioxide, 0
03 percent and hydrogen, helium, ozone, neon, zenan, etc
 are present in small amounts in pure and dry air
 nam vayumandal main jal vaashp kii maatra 5 pratishat tak hoti he
 Atmospheric water vapor is obtained from the waters of seas, reservoirs, flora and soil
 jal vaashp kii maatra bumadhya rekha se dhruvon kii ore ghatati jaati he
 Due to water vapor, there is cloud, fog, frost, rain, dew, snow, hail, snow
 vayumandal main ozon parat kii prithvi or us par rahane vaale jeevon ke liye badi hi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This layer absorbs 93–99% of the high frequency ultraviolet light coming from the Sun, which is harmful to life on Earth
 ozon kii parat kii khoj 1913 main frans ke bhautikavid fabri charles or henry buson ne kii thi
 The average organization of dry air on the earth is as follows: vayumandal garmi ko rokkar rakhane main ek vishaal 'kaanch ghar' kaa kaam karata he, jo laghu tarangon or vikiran ko prithvi ke dharaatal par aane detaa he, parantu prithvi se viksit hone vaali tarangon ko baahar jane se roktaa he
 In this way the atmosphere maintains even temperature on the earth
 vayumandal main jalawaashp evam gaison ke atirikt sookshm thos kan bhi upasthit hai
 Atmospheric humidity depends on the water vapor present in the air
 yah jalawaashp vayumandal ke nichle staron main rahata he
 Its quantity is not the same in all places and always
 samyaanusaar usamen antar hote rahete hai
 This water vapor is formed by evaporation of water of river, pond, lake, ocean etc
 vayumandaleey ardrata main do baton par dhyaan dena chahie: Atmospheric humidity is mainly measured by two types of scales: vayumandaleey taap kaa mulstrot surya he
 Air gets more heat from the earth's contact than the sun, because dust is affected by it
 ye dhulikan, jo ooshmaa ke kuchaalak hote hai, bhuprishth par evam uske nikat adhik hote hai or vayumandal main oonchaai ke anusaar kam hote jate hai
 Therefore, initially the rays of the sun heat the surface
 phir vahi ooshmaa sanchaalan dwaara kramash: vayumandal ke nichle str se upree str kii ore failati jaati he
 In addition, the air rises up by heating, filling the blanks with relatively frosty air; Then she also gets hot and rises up
 falat: sanvaahan dharaayen utpann ho jaati hai
 Therefore, conduction and conduction work in spreading over heat
 vayumandaleey dabaav athwa vayudab kisi sthaan ke ikai kshetrafal par vayumandal ke stambh kaa bhaar hota he
 At any plane, the atmospheric pressure is the weight of the air above it
 yah dabaav bhuprishth ke nikat oonchaai ke saath shighrata se, tathaa vayumandal main adhik oonchai par dhire dhire, ghatata he
 But at any place it is not constant relative to the height of the air
 mausam or rituon ke parivartan ke saath isamen antar hote rahete hai
 Atmospheric pressure is measured by various aerodynamics
 sagar tal par vayumandaleey dabaav 760 mimi parastambh ke daab ke baraabar hota he
 Their meaning is the same
 iske aadhaar par maanchitr par ise samadab rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 On this, the air load-boxes, the direction of the winds, velocity, change of direction, etc
 depend
