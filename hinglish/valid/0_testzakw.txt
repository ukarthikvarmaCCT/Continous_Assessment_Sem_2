 In front of them, fire was running after the water of the global rivers
 sadanira nadi ko agni sukha nahin sake or videgh maathav dwaara yah puche jane par ki ab meraa nivas kahan ho, agni ne uttar diya ki is nadi ke purv kii ore tumhaara nivas ho
 It is clearly mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmin that earlier Brahmins did not cross this river and the land here was not fertile
 usamen daldal bahut tha kyonki agni vaishwanar ne uskaa aswadan nahin kiya tha
 But now it is very fertile because the Brahmins have sacrificed it and offered it to the fire

 is granth main ganga se lekar himalay ke bich sthit mithila main mukhya 15 nadiyon kii sthiti maani gayi he tathaa unke naam bhi ginaye gayi hai
 Explaining the significance of Mithila, the mithila-mahatmya section of the Old Age Purana states that there is the ultimate sacred arrowhead consisting of 15 rivers between the Ganges and the Himalayas

 punah ganga tathaa mahashon ko paar karke magadh main jane kii baat kahi gayi he
 It seems clear from this that at that time Mithila's position in the north of Magadha has been considered
 vajji pradesh mithila ke antargat hi samavisht tha
 Even in this mention of the Mahabharata, the areas of the border area of mithila mentioned elsewhere are up to Gandaki in the west and Ganga in the south

 He remained here till the end of his life

 Here a fair is held on the 5th of Muharram in memory of his death date
 wardha jile main bhi ek pahari jagah girid par unke naam par mela lagata he
 He also came in contact with yogis and probably used to exchange ideas in the local language
 kaha jaataa he ki baba ne apane chelon ke liye hindi main zikr kaa bhi anuwaad kiya
 Amir Khurd, author of Sierul Auliya, also mentions a couplets of Multani language composed by Baba
 guru granth sahab main shaikh farid ke 112 'salok' uddhrut hai
 Although the subject is the one on which Baba often spoke, he is known to have composed the composition of a disciple of Baba Farid who came in contact with Baba Nanak
 isi prakaar fawoubussaalekin, asrarukh auliya evam rahtul kulb naamak granth bhi baba farid kii rachana nahin hai
 Nizamuddin Auliya gained immense fame among the disciples of Baba Farid
 vastav main baba farid ke aadhyatmik evam naitik prabhaav ke kaaran unke samakalinon ko islam ke samajhane main badi suvidha hui
 He died in 1265 AD

 satvaahan pracheen bharat kaa ek rajvansh tha
 It ruled central South India from 230 BC to the second century
 yah maury vansh ke patan ke baad shaktishaalee hua tha
 They are mentioned in the 8th century BC
 ashok kii mrityu ke baad satvahanon ne khud ko swatantra ghoshit kar diya tha
 The first dynasty to carry the lead coin was the Satavahana dynasty, and that lead coin was brought from Rome
 pracheen bharat main maury vansh ke antargat pehali baar rajnatik evam saanskrithik ekta sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Later, the Satavahana dynasty carried this effort forward
 yadhyapi itihaaskaar satvahanon ko dakkan main mauryon kaa uttaradhikari hai tathaapi is vansh ke udai ko ashok ke buddha rajya ke viruddh saamaanya jain tathaa hindu prakriya ke rup main bhi samajha janaa chahie
 The Satavahana dynasty was established about fifty years before the defeat of the Maurya dynasty
 unka samrajya dakshin bharat kaa sabase pracheen or bada samrajya tha
 In contrast to the ever-changing dynastic landscape of North India, the Satavahanas established an empire in the Deccan unbreakable, indivisible and lasting for a long period, which ruled for nearly four and a half hundred years
 is kaal ke vishay main jitani jaankaree hamen praapt hui he usase hamen satvahanon kii vilakshantaa tathaa vibhinn kshetron main unki advithiya gatividhiyon kaa gyaan hota he
 If the statements of Puranas are to be believed, then the boundaries of this kingdom of Deccan extended to North India
 magadh is samrajya kaa ek hissaa tha, dakshini bharat main bhi failaav tha tathaa purvi se pashchimi samundra tak isaki simaaen vistrut thi
 The empire was formed by the coordination of different species of Malavas, Bhojas, Pathanikas, Rathikas, Andhra, Parindas and Dravidas etc
 of North and South India and in this view the Satavahana Empire was more than that of the Mauryan Empire in the area
 Was structured ye satvahanon dwaara madhya bharat tathaa dakkan main pradutt lambe evam shantipurna shashan kaal kaa hi parinaam tha ki kala evam sthapaty kaa vikaas hua jinke udhaaharan ham pashchim bharat kii shilaon main taraashi hui guhaaon tathaa purvi bharat ke stupon evam viharon main paa sakate he
 During this period, culture also developed immensely and the attraction of Prakrit language reached the courts
 yadhyapi satvaahan rajya ek hindu samrajya tha tathpi unke aadhin buddha dharm kaa advithiya vikaas hua
 There was also great progress in the areas of trade, commerce and water transport
 satvahanon ke vishay main jaankaree dene vaale evam sroton kaa nitant abhaav he
 The number of inscriptions related to them is very less and even in the references given in this presented inscriptions, complete information about the Satavahanas is not available
 unke vishay main hamaare paas purvi dakkan se praapt unniis shilaalekh hi hai
 Which is not used from any point of view to give information about the thirty kings of this dynasty and the long reign of four and a half hundred years
 yadhyapi puraatatv vibhaag ne pracheen hyderabad rajya main paithaan, maski tathaa pondapur main khudaai karwaai parantu yahan se adhik sakshya nahi mili
 In this subject, coins received by the kings of the Satavahana dynasty which have been found from eastern and western Deccan and Madhya Pradesh, we get important information about this dynasty
 thomas, rapasan, kanigham, bhagwaan laal indra ji tathaa scot jaisai vidwaanon nen in sikkon se mahatvapurn jaankaree praapt kii he
 But due to the dissolution of these coins and the counterfeiting of some coins, many controversies have arisen
 is vishay main saahitiyik stroton ne to or bhi adhik niraash kiya he
 In the original Puranas, due to the parts connected in time, the information given about them in Satavahanas is no longer reliable
 saath hi vibhinn puraanon main satvahanon ke sandarbh main martaky na hone ke kaaran sthiti ore bhi sandehaaspad ho gai he
 Although the Brihada Katha composed by Gunadhaya is believed to have been written under the patronage of the Satavahana kingdom, however, this work is no longer found in its original form and based on this, the information given in later versions is different from different scholars
 isi prakaar leelavati jo ki satvaahan shaasha kaal ke sainik abhiyaanon evam vijayon se sambandhit he, par bhi adhik adhik vishwaas nahi kiya ja saktaa
 For this reason, our information about the Satavahana period is limited
 satvahanon ke abhyuday tathaa unke mul nivas sthaan ko le kar vibhinn vidwaanon main gaharaa matbhed he
 The Satavahana and Shatakarni rulers mentioned in the inscriptions and coins are called in the Puranas by the names of Andhra, Andhra-death and Andhra
 is aadhaar par vidwaan is nirnay par pahunche he ki satvaahan athwa shatakarani raja andhron ke samatuly the
 According to Rappson, Smith and Bhandarkar, Satavahana rulers were related to Andhra country
 andhra logon ke vishay main puraana kehete he ki ve log pracheen telugu pradesh jo ki godavari tathaa krishna nadi ke madhya main sthit tha, ke nivasee the
 He is mentioned in the Aitareya Brahmin as a caste that was free from the influence of the Aryans
 indica main magasthanij unki shakti evam samruddhi kaa ullekh kiya ha
 Ashoka's inscriptions describe him as one of the people who were under the influence of his empire
 parantu maury samrajya ke patan ke baad unka kya hua iskaa pataa nahi chalata
 Possibly, he had freed himself
 upar varnit itihaaskaar yadhyapi andhrapradesh ko satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan maanate he tathaapi unki shakti ke kendra ko lekar in vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 Where Smith considers Sri Kakulam as the capital of Satavahanas or Andhra
 parantu satvaahan ke andhron ke saath sambandh ko lekar vidwaanon main matbhed he
 In the inscriptions of the Samavahana dynasty, the rulers of this period are consistently called Satavahanas or Shatakarnis
 saahitiyik granthon main inke liye yadakada shaali vaahan shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But in this context, the word Andhra is not used in any inscription of this dynasty
 duusari ore shilalekhon, sikkon tathaa saahitiyik sroton ke aadhaar par pashchimi bharat ko inkaa mul nivas sthaan mana gaya he
 Evidence of this fact is also found in the early inscriptions of Nanaghat and Saanchi
 is aadhaar par dow gopalchaari ne pratishthan tathaa uske aasapaas ke kshetra ke satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan mana he
 In addition VS Sukuthankar to Bellary district; h c Rai Chaudhary has considered the southern part of the other country and VV Mirashi as the original abode of Satavahanas on both sides of the river Ganges
 is aadhaar par satvahanon tathaa andhron kaa samatuly evam sajaatiy hona sandehaaspad hi he
 In this subject scholars have suggested that the Satavahanas started their early life in the Deccan and conquered Andhra Pradesh in a short time
 kaalaantar main jab shaq tathaa amir akramanon ke kaaran satvaahan samrajya ke pashchimi tathaa uttari kshetra unke haathon se jate rahe tab kadaachit unki shakti godavari tathaa krishna nadi ke madhya kshetra arthath andhra pradesh tak simit ho gai tathaa ab satvahanon ko andhron ke naam se janaa jane laga
 We do not even know about the origin of Satavahanas
 kuch vidwaanon ne unki tulana ashok ke shilalekhon main varnit satiyaputronse tathaa kuch ne plini dwaara varnit setai se kii he
 Some other scholars have defined the words Shatakarni and Satavahana on the basis of the term Bhasha Vigyan, irrespective of the importance of these words, but based on the inscriptions of the Satavahana dynasty it is almost certain that the Satavahanas were also Brahmins like the Sunga and Kanva rulers
 
 is baat kaa pramaan nasik shilaalekh se bhi mil jaataa he jisamen gautami putr shri shatakarni ko ek brahman tathaa khatiya-dap-maan-madan arthath kshatriyon kaa maan mardan karne vaala aadi oopaadhiyon se sushebhit kiya he
 The author of this inscription has compared Gautamiputra to Parasurama
 saath hi datrishatputalika main bhi shalivahanon ko mishrit brahman jati tathaa nagajati se utpann mana gaya he
 There are deep differences among scholars regarding the chronology of the Satavahanas
 aitreyay brahman jo ki paanch sau i0purv main likhaa gaya tha usamen andhron ko aise dasyu bataaya gaya he jo ki arya paridhi se baahar the tathaa jo vishwamitra ke vanshaj the
 On this basis, Dr
 DR Bhandarkar has considered the beginning of the Satavahanas as early as 500 BC
 dovi0e0 smith ke anusaar andhra pehle adhinsth the parantu uski mrityu ke pashchaat ve simukh ke netritv main swatantra ho gaye tathaa yah ghatana teesri shatabdi i0purv main hui
 In this subject, Smith has considered the basis of Puranas according to which a total of thirty rulers of Andhra ruled for about 460 years
 dogopalchaari ne bhi is tathy ko sweekaarte hue yah mana he ki satvaahan vansh kii sthapana lagbhag 235i0purv tathaa uskaa patan lagbhag 255 isvi main hua
 On the basis of the inscription of elephant elephants during the reign of Kharkhel, the ruler of Kalinga, Rappson believes the beginning of the Satavahana dynasty between 220 BCE and 211 AD, but there is a difference in various Puranas regarding the Yasan period of the Satavahanas
 ek ore jaha matsaypurana unka kul yasana kaal 460varsh bataata he vahiin duusari ore brahmanpurana main yah avadhi 456 varsh bataai gai he
 According to the Vayupurana, the Satavahanas ruled for 411 years while Vishnupuran considers their reign as 300 years
 duusari aar dow aar0 ji0 bhandarkar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana 72
73 i0purv ko maanate hai
 On the basis of a statement mentioned in the Puranas, he has believed that the "shunga Miryatya" Kanva rulers were the servants of the Shunga rulers and ruled alongside them like the Peshwas and the founder of the Satavahana dynasty named Simuk or Shishuka ruled the Kanva king
 After killing Sushraman, he killed both the Kanva and Shung dynasties and subjugated his empire
 parantu yah tathy avishwasaneey he kyoking ham yah bhalee-bhaanti jaanate he ki shunga tathaa kanv vansh ke shaskaon ne kabhi sanyukt rup se shashan nahi kiya tathaa kanv vansh ke sansthaapak vasudev kanv ne antim shunga shaasha devbhuti kii hatya kar shashan kii bagdor sambhaali thi
 The statement of Vayu Purana on the basis of which Dr Bhandarkar has misinterpreted, is rightly defined by Dr Rai Chaudhary
 unke anusaar yah gandyash maatra itnaa hi bataata he ki simuk ne jab kanv vansh kaa ant kar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana kii to usne un shunga upashaskaon bhi samaapt kar diya jo ki kanv vansh ke haathon shunga shaskaon ke parajeet hone ke baad bhi bache rah gaye the
 Hence, Satavahana rulers took over the reins of their rule by ending the Kanva dynasty in 29 BC
 parantu is sab karkon ke hote hue bhi is sambhaavna se inkaar nahi kiya ja saktaa ki simuk jisane 23varshon tak shashan kiya vah kuch samay pehle hi arthath pehali shatabdi i0pus0 ke madhya main hi singhasanarudh ho gaya hoga
 Simuk was the founder of the Satavahana dynasty and ruled for almost 23 years from 235 BC to 212 BC
 yadhyapi uske vishay main hamen adhik jaankaree nahi milti tathaapi puraanon se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki kanv shaskaon kii shakti kaa naash kar tathaa bache hue shunga mukhiyaaon kaa daman karke usne satvaahan vansh kii neenv rakhi
 In the Puranas, in addition to Symek, he is also called Shishuk, Sindhuk and Shiprak etc
 jain anushrutiyon ke anusaar simuk ne apane shashan kaal main jain tathaa buddha mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaaya, parantu apane shashan kaal ke antkaal main vah pathbhrasht tathaa croor ho gaya jis karanvash use padchyut kar uski hatya kar di
 After Simuk's death, his younger brother Kanha ascended the throne
 apane 18 varshon ke kaarykaal main kanha ne samrajya visataar kii niti ko apanaaya
 The inscription of Nashik suggests that the Satavahana empire spread west to Nashik in the time of Kanha
 shatakarni-p kanha ke uparant shatakarni pratham gaddi par baitha
 According to the Puranas, he was the son of Kanha
 parantu dow gopalchaari simuk ko shatakarni pratham kaa pita maanate hai
 Some scholars have believed that its rule lasted for two years, but Neelkanth Shastri has considered his reign from 194 BC to 185 BC
 jo bhi ho yah suspasht he ki uskaa shashan kaal bahut lambaa nahi tha
 But despite being short, the tenure of Shatkarni i is more important from some perspectives
 satvaahan shaskaon main vah pehla tha jisane is vansh ke shaskaon main priy evam prachlit, ‘‘shatakarni’’ shabd se apana namakaran kiya
 According to the Nanaghat inscription, Shatkarni expanded his empire and performed two Ashwamedha Yajna and one Rajasuya Yajna during his work
 uski rani nayanika ke ek shilaalekh se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki shatakarni pratham ne pashchimi malwa ke saath-saath anup tathaa vidarbha pradeshon bhi jeet liya
 If Shatkarni i is the only ruler mentioned in the archway of the Sanchi Stupa, it also proves that in his time central India was under the authority of the Satavahanas
 vah apane chhate se kaary kaal me samraat ban gaya tathaa usne dakshin pathpati tathaa apratihat chakra aadi oopaadhiyaan dhaaran kii
 It is suggested on the basis of the similarity of the script used in the Nanaghat article and the Elephant Gumpha writings, that perhaps in the second year of the reign of this Shatkarni rulers, the great ruler of Kalinga, Kharkhel was defeated in the battle field
 shatakarni pratham kii patni nayanika athwa naganika angeey kul ke ek maharathi trankairo kii putree thi
 After the death of Shatkarni I, his two minor sons Vedashree and Satashri sat on the throne
 parantu alpavyask hone ke kaaran prashasan kii sari bagdor unki maa nayanika ke haathon main aa gai jisane apane pita kii sahaayta se shashan chalaaya
 It seems that Vedashree died at a young age and Satshri took over as his successor
 parantu puraana is vishay main ekamat he ki shatakarni pratham ke pashchaat purnotsang naamak raja satvaahan singhaasana par asin hua
 Regardless of the name of the fourth Satavahana ruler, it is certain that it was during the reign of this ruler that Pushyamitra Sunga conquered the last Mauryan ruler Brahadratha and took over the kingdom of Magadha
 matsaypurana main skandastambhi kaa ullekh satvaahan vansh ke paanchaven shaasha ke rup main keya he parantu adhiktar vidwaan is naam ko kalpit maanate hai
 Shatkarni II ruled from about 166 BC to 111 BC
 yah kadaachit vahi shaasha tha jiskaa varnan hithigumpha tathaa bhilsa shilalekhon main hua he
 It seems that during its reign, the Satavahanas snatched eastern Malwa from a successor of Pushyamitra Sunga
 puraanon ke anusaar shatakarni dwitiya ke pashchaat lambodar rajsinghaasana par asin hua
 After Lambodar, his son Appellant ascended the throne
 apilak jo ki aathvaan satvaahan shaasha tha, in donaan ke madhya kaa kaal satvahanon ke sandarbh main andhkaar yug mana gaya he jisamen keval kuntal shatakarni ke kaal ko hi apwaad mana ja saktaa he
 Kuntal Shatkarni was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas after the appellant
 kamasutra main vatsayan ne kuntal shatakarni kaa ullekh karte hue likhaa he ki usne apni ungaliyon ko kanchi ke rup main prayog kiya tathaa iske prahaar se uski pataraani malayavati kii mrityu ho gai
 In Kavyamamsha, Rajeshwar describes Kuntal Shatkarni as saying that he had ordered his queens living in his Raniwas to use only Prakrit language
 haal satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatpurna shaasha tha
 Although he ruled only four years, his reign was very important in some subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yadi aarmabhik satvaahan shaskaon main shatakarni pratham yoddha ke rup main sabase mahaan tha to haal shantidoot ke rup main agrani tha
 Hall also had a literary interest and became famous as a poet emperor
 uske naam kaa ullekh puraana, leelavati, saptshati, abhidhaan chintamani aadi granthon main hua he
 It is believed that Saptashati or Satsai was written recently in the Prakrit language
 brihadakatha ke lekhak gunanty bhi haal kaa samakaleen tha tathaa kadaachit pashachi bhashaa main likhi is pustak kii rachana usne haal hi ke sangrakshan main kii thi
 In Kalantar, the three books named Buddhavami's Brihakatha-'ilok-sangra ', Kshemendra's brihadatha-manjari and Somdev's Kathasaritasagar originated from the Briha story of Gunadhya
 haal ke pradhan senapati vijayanand ne apane swami ke aadeshaanusaar srilanka par akraman kar use jeet liya
 While returning from this conquest, he stopped for some time at a place called Sapta Godavari Bhimam
 vahaan vijayanand ne srilanka ke raja kii ati rupavaan putree leelavati kii charchaa suni jiskaa varnan usne apane raja haal se kiya
 Hall tried to marry Lilavati
 kivdanti he ki haal ne purvi dakkan main kuch sainik abhiyaan kiye parantu saakshyon ke abhaav main adhiktar vidwaan ise galat maanate hai
 However, in the recent reign of Satavahana rulers, in addition to the political field, there was a lot of development in literary and economic areas as well as the development of trade and commerce cities and the advancement of water transport which during the reign of second Mundlak or Puridransen in the first century AD
 Reached its culmination, however, for about fifty years to come proved very difficult for the Satavahana Empire Happened
 aisa prathit hua maano ke pashchim kshatrapon ke rup main hue videshi akraman ke saath hi satvaahan samrajya kaa patan hone ko he
 The Kushans were spreading in the north-west and under their pressure, the Shaka and Pahlav rulers were eager to fight with the Satavahanas, attracted towards central and western India
 kshahraat vansh ke pashchimi kshatrapon ne apane ko pashchima raajputana, gujarat tathaa kathiyawad main sthapit kar liya tha
 These Shaka rulers attacked the Satavahana kingdom from 35 AD to about 90 AD
 unhone satvahanon se purvi tathaa payichama malwa pradeshon ko jeeta; uttari konkan uttari maharashtra, jo ki satvaahan shakti kaa kendra tha tathaa banavaasi tak faile dakshini maharashtra par bhi apana prabhutv jamaa liya
 The first ruler of the Kshatra dynasty was Ghoomak whose sources of information are some coins which have been found mostly from the coastal region of Gujarat Kathiawar and Yadakada Malwa
 ghumak kaa uttaradhikari nahpaan tha jisaki jaankaree hamen uske bahusankhya sikkon par raja kii oopaadhi dhaaran kii he
 At the same time, inscriptions got his titles Kshatrap and Mahakshatrap
 nasik, karle tathaa junar ke uske shilaalekh; esake bahusankhya sikken tathaa uske jamata shaq ashavdaat ke dwaara uttari tathaa dakshini bharat main die gaye daan sab ke sab ye pramanit karte hai ki nahpaan ke samay main kshahraat vansh kaa samrajya kaaphi vistut tha tathaa usne satvaahan shaskaon se kaaphi bada pradesh chin kar hi apane samrajya ko itnaa vishaal banaaya tha
 Nahapan and his Jamaat Shaka Ashwadat unleashed the Satavahana power in the western Deccan by conquering Malwa, the Narmada Valley, northern Konkan, the western part of Berar and and southern Maharashtra
 ve satvaahan raja jo nahpaan ke haathon parajeet hue kadaachit sundar shatakarni, chakor shatakarni tathaa shivsaati the jinka ki kaarykaal bahut hi chota tha parantu yah paristhitiyaan adhik samay tak nahi chali tathaa gautami putr shri shatakarni ke satvaahan shaasha banate hi is kshahraat-satvaahan sangharsh main nayaa mode aayaa
 After nearly half a century of turmoil and honor at the hands of the Shaka rulers, Gautami reestablished his lost reputation under the leadership of son Shatkarni
 gautami putr shri shatakarni satvaahan vansh kaa sabase mahaan shaasha tha jisane lagbhag 25 varshon tak shashan karte hue na keval apane samrajya kii khoi pratishtha ko purnsthapit kiya apitu ek vishaal samrajya kii bhi sthapana kii
 In the time of Gautami's son and his victories, we get complete information from the Nashik inscriptions of his mother Gautami Balashree
 kuch visheshgyon dwaara gautamiputra satkarni ko raja shalivahan bhi mana jaataa he
 He united the whole of India and defended against foreign invaders
 uske sandarbh main hamen is lekh se yah jaankaree milti he ki usne kshatriyon ke ahankaar kaa maan-mardan kiya
 He is described as the doer of Saka, Yavan and Pahlav Sasakas
 uski sabase badi uplabdhi kshahraat vansh ke shaq shaasha nahpaan tathaa uske vanshajon kii uske haathon hui paraajay thi
 The silver coins of Nahapan obtained from the Jogalthambi group which Gautami's son Shatkarni reintroduced and in the eighteenth year of his reign, by Gautami's son making a cavity at Pandu-lan near Nashik - these are some of the facts that prove that he Rejuvenated the territories taken away by the Shaka rulers
 nahpaan ke saath unka yuddh uske shashan kaal ke 17wein or 18wein varsh main hua tathaa is yuddh main jeet kar rgatmi putr ne aparant, anup, saurashtra, cooker, akar tathaa avanti ko nahpaan se chin liya
 Apart from these areas, Gautami's son also had dominion over Rishik, Ayamak, Moolak and Vidarbha etc
 uske pratyaksh prabhaav main rahane vaala kshetra uttar main malwa tathaa kathiyawad se lekar dakshin main krishna nadi tak tathaa puvai main baraar se lekar pashchim main konkan tak failaa hua tha
 He assumed the title 'tri-sea-toy-yellow-vehicle', indicating that his influence was in the eastern, western and southern seas, that is, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean
 aisa prathit hota he ki apni mrityu ke kuch samay pehle gautami putr shatakarni dwaara nahpaan ko haraakar jite gaye kshetra uske haath se nikal gaye
 Those who snatched these territories from Gautami's son were probably the Shaka rulers of the Kardamak dynasty of the Scythian race
 iskaa pramaan hamen talami dwaara bhugol kaa varnan karti uski pustak se miltaa he
 a similar conclusion can also be drawn from the famous Rudradaman inscription of Junagadh of 150 AD
 yah shilaalekh darshata he ki nahpaan se vijit gautamiputra shatakarni ke sabhi pradeshon ko usase rudradaman ne hathiyaa liya
 It appears that Gautamiputra Shatkarni attempted to secure his territories captured by Rudradaman by establishing matrimonial relations with the Kardamak Shakas

 The zine is sometimes called saddle but note that the word saddle also has other meanings
 oont kii zeen ko kajava bhi kaha jaataa he
 The ‘zine’ is called ‘saddle’ in English and ‘sarge’ in Arabic
 halanki 'zeen' ko 'lathi' bhi kaha jaataa he, dhyaan den ki lathi se taatpary kisi bhi dhaanche kaa ho saktaa he or iskaa sahi angrezi barabari kaa shabd 'frem' he
 For example, bodybuilders are called 'strong saddles'
 zeen ghode par chadhaane vaala ek prakaar kaa dhaancha he isliye ise 'lathi' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Viruses are unicellular microorganisms that can grow in lineage only in living cells
 ye nabhikeey amla or protein se milakar gathit hote hai, sharir ke baahar to ye mrit-samaan hote hai parantu sharir ke andar jivit ho jate hai
 They can be assembled as crystals
 ek vishaanu bina kisi sajiv madhyam ke punarutpaadan nahin kar saktaa he
 It can remain dormant for hundreds of years and whenever it comes in contact with a living medium or holder, the cell of that organism penetrates and makes the organism sick
 ek baar jab vishaanu jivit koshika main pravesh kar jaataa he, vah koshika ke mul arene evam diene kii genetic sanrachana ko apni genetic soochna se badal detaa he or sankramit koshika apane jaise sankramit koshikaon kaa punarutpaadan shuru kar detii he
 The literal meaning of the English word virus is venom
 sarvapratham san 1796 main doctor edward jiner ne pataa lagaaya ki chechak, vishaanu ke kaaran hota he
 He also invented the smallpox vaccine
 iske baad san 1886 main adolf meyar ne bataaya ki tambaaku main mojeyk rog ek vishesh prakaar ke virus ke dwaara hota he
 Russian botanist Ivanovsky also discovered the existence of the virus in 1892 while studying mosaic disease in tobacco
 bejernik or bor ne bhi tambaaku ke pattey par iskaa prabhaav dekha or uskaa naam tobaco mojeyk rakhaa
 The reason for placing the word mosaic was to find a mark on the tobacco leaf similar to that of mosaic
 is chinh ko dekhakar is vishesh vishaanu kaa naam unhone tobaco mojeyk virus rakhaa
 Viruses are both beneficial and harmful
 jeevanubhoji vishaanu ek laabhprad vishaanu he, yah haija, pechish, typhoid aadi rog utpann karne vaale jeevanuon ko nasht kar maanav kii rogon se raksha karata he
 Some viruses cause disease in plants or animals and are harmful
 echivi, influenza virus, polio virus rog utpann karne vaale pramukh vishaanu hai
 Viruses are transmitted by contact, by air, by food and water, and by insects, but specific types of viruses are transmitted by specific methods
 aaysha miran ke balaatkaar or hatya kaa aapraadhik maamla vijaywada main 2007 main hua tha
 Newspapers and television channels across India prominently brought this matter to the public for a long time and the matter also remained part of many discussions
 aaysha miran naamak ek 19 varshiya farmesi kii chaatra thi jisko vijaywada main uske chatravaas main 22 varshiya pi
 satyam babu ne berahami se balaatkaar karne ke baad uski hatya kar di thi
 His dead body was found in a bathroom on 27 December 2007 after being stabbed with a knife
 laash ke saath hatyare dwaara ek patr choda gaya tha jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki chunki aaysha ne uske pyaar ko thukraa diya tha, isliye uskaa pehle balaatkaar hua or phir uski hatya kar di gai he
 P
 Satyam Babu's relatives and human rights activists allege that the police were trying to implicate him in an attempt to save the real culprits in the case
 unhone kaha ki satyam babu ek tantrika-sambandhi vikaar se peedit he or chal bhi nahin saktaa
 Doctors at the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences confirmed her walking problem
 iske alaava peedit ladki ke mata - pita ne bhi police kii is baat kaa inkaar kiya ki babu ne aaysha kii hatya kii he or un logon ne daawa kiya ki police kuch raajnneetik se jude prabhaavshaalee logon ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 P
 Satyam Babu was first arrested in August 2008
 iske baavjood, pakade jane ke chand hi ghanton main vah pulicekarmiyon ko us samay dhokhaa dene or bhaagane main kaamiyaab ho gaya jab police dal nalgonda zile ke suryapet main bhojan ke liye ek hotel gaye the
 Police were taking the accused to Vijayawada after treatment at a hospital in Hyderabad
 vijaywada police ne aaropee ke faraar hone ke turant baad 11 pulicekarmiyon ko nilambit kar diya tha
 Despite all efforts to escape, Satyam Babu was caught in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh in a few hours
 vijaywada main mahilaon kii ek vishesh adaalat ne hatya ke liye bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 302 ke tahat hatya ke maamle main pi
 satyam babu ko 14 saal jail kii sazaa sunai or balaatkaar ke liye bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 376 ke tahat sashram karawas kii 10 saal saal jail kii sazaa sunai
 The court ordered the completion of both jail terms simultaneously
 adaalat ne satyam babu ko 1,000 rupee jurmaana dene yaa chah maheene atirikt jail main guzaarane kaa aadesh diya tha
 The cell is the anatomical and functional unit of living organisms and often has the ability of spontaneous reproduction
 yah vibhinn padaarthon kaa vah chote-se-chota sangathit rup he jisamen ve sabhi kriyaayein hoti hai jinhen samuhik rup se ham jivan kehate hai
 The English word cell 'cell' is derived from the Latin word 'shellula' which means 'a small room'
 kuch sajiv jaise jeevanuon ke sharir ek hi koshika se bane hote hai, unhen ekkoshkeey jeev kehete hai jabaki kuch sajiv jaise manushya kaa sharir anek koshikaon se milakar bana hota he unhen bahukoshkeey sajiv kehete hai
 The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 AD
 1839 i0 main shliden tathaa shwaan ne koshika siddhanth prastut kiya jiske anusaar sabhi sajivon kaa sharir ek yaa ekaadhik koshikaon se milakar bana hota he tathaa sabhi koshikaon kii utpatti pehle se upasthit kisi koshika se hi hoti he
 All biological functions of living organisms occur within cells
 koshikaon ke bheetar hi aavashyak anuvaanshik suchnaayen hoti hai jinase koshika ke kaaryon kaa niyantran hota he tathaa suchnaayen agali peedi kii koshikaon main sthaanantarit hoti hai
 The methodological study of cells is called cytology or 'cell biology'
 unhone jivit koshika ko daant kii khurachni main dekha tha 
 There are two types of cells, prokariotic koshikaaye praayah swatantra hoti hai jabaki eukariotic koshikaaye, bahukoshiya praaniyon main paayi jaati hai
 The prokaryotic cell has no clear nucleus
 kendrakeey padaarth koshika drav main bikhare hote hai
 This type of cell is found in bacteria and blue-green algae
 sabhi ucch shrenee ke paudhon or jantuon main eukariotic prakaar kii koshika pai jaati he
 All eukaryotic cells have an organized nucleus that is covered by a covering
 koshikaaye sajiv hoti hai tathaa ve sabhi kaary karti hai, jinhen sajiv praani karte hai
 Their shape is minimal and shape is spherical, oval, columnar, porous, flagellate, polygonal etc
 ye jelly jaisi ek vastu dwaara ghiri hoti hai
 This coating is called cytoplasm or cell-membrane
 This membrane is subcutaneous permeable, which means that this membrane allows a substance to cross freely, allow a limited amount of passage, or even stop
 ise kabhi-kabhi 'jeevadravya kala' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The following structures are found within it: - kuch khaas bhinnataaon ko chhod sabhi prakaar kii koshikaon, padap evam jantu koshika kii sanrachana lagbhag ek jaisi hoti he
 They are made up of both living and non-living units
 ek saamaanya koshika yaa praroopik koshika ke mukhya teen bhaag hai, koshikaavaran, koshika dravya evam kendrak
 The cytoplasm is the outermost covering or enclosure of the cell
 padap koshika main koshika bhitti or koshika jhilli milakar koshikaavaran kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The cell wall is not found in the animal cell, so the cell membrane is the outermost covering
 koshika jhilli evam kendrak ke bich ke bhaag ko koshika dravya kaha jaataa he, isamen vibhinn koshikang hote hai
 The nucleus is a round and dense structure found inside the cell
 kendrak ko koshika kaa 'mastishk' kaha jaataa he
 Just as the brain controls all the functions of the body, in the same way all the functions of the cell are controlled by the nucleus
 ek koshika main saamanytah ek hi cendrak hota he, kintu kabhi-kabhi ek se adhik cendrak bhi paae jate hai
 It is the operating center of all the functions of the cell
 jab koshika vibhajit hoti he to iskaa bhi vibhaajan ho jaataa he
 a fluid within the nucleus cell often floats in cytoplasm
 iskaa yadhyapi koi nishchit sthaan nahin hota, tathaapi yah adhiktar lagbhag madhyabhaag main hi sthit hota he
 In some cells, its position is basal and in some it is also marginal
 cendrak kii akruti golakaar, vartulakaar yaa andakaar hoti he
 However, sometimes it can be of cylindrical, elliptical, sapta, branching, pear like, lanceolate etc
 formats
 iske bheetar centrekaras kendrika tathaa pitrusutra paae jate hai
 The nucleus cover is called nucleus
 prayek cendrak main ek yaa adhik kendrikas pai jaati hai
 The nucleus disappears at some particular stage of cell division, but later reappears

 This part of the cell is extremely conscious and the center of all biological processes of the cell
 ise isiilie 'sajiv' kaha jaataa he
 Biologists call it the 'physical basis of life'
 aadhunik jeev vaigyanikon ne jeevadravya kaa rasinic vishleshan karke yah to pataa laga liya he ki uskaa nirmaan kin-kin ghatakon dwaara hua he, kintu aaj tak kisi bhi vaigyanik ko usamen praan kaa sanchaar karne main safalataa haath nahin lagi he

 It contains about 80% protein, 15% water, 3% fat and 1% carbohydrate and 1 inorganic salt
 jeevadravyon ke kai prakaar hote hai, jaise colide, kanabh, tantumay, jalidaar, koopikacar, aadi
 The organ is named after its explorer Camilo Golgi, who first discovered it in 1898
 yah ang saadharantah cendrak ke sameep, akele yaa samoohon main paaya jaataa he
 It is composed by three elements or components: flat shell, large vacancies and intent
 yah ek prakaar ke jaal jaisaa dikhalaai detaa he
 Their main function is cellular secretion and storage of proteins, fats and certain ferments
 ye kanikaon yaa shalakaon kii akritiwale hote hai
 These organs are located in the cytoplasm

 They range in size from 1 / 2 micron to 2 microns
 viral udaahranon main inaki lambaai 40 micron tak ho sakati he
 Many of his works have been described, which depend on his shape
 tathaapi inkaa mukhya kaary koshikeey shwasan batalaaya jaataa he
 These are called the 'power plants' of the cell, because they supply the necessary energy
 yah jalika koshikadravya main aashyon or nalikaaon ke rup main faili rahati he
 Its position is usually between the centripetal membrane and the fluid, but it often extends throughout the cell
 yah jalika do prakaar kii hoti he : chikani satahavaali or khurduri satahavaali 
 Its surface is rough because ribosome particles are scattered on it
 iske anke kaary batalaaye gaye hai, jaise yantric aadhaaran, dravyon kaa prayaavartan, ant: koshikeey abhigaman, protone sanshleshan ityadi
 The word is made up of the words chrome and soma, which means: colored objects
 gunasutra centrakon ke bheetar jodon main paae jate hai or koshika vibhaajan ke saath cendrak sahit baant jaaya karte hai
 The organisms located in them are said to be the carriers of ancestral qualities of ancestors
 inaki sankhya jeevon main nishchit hoti he, jo ek do jodon se lekar kai sau jodon tak ho sakati he
 They range in size from 1 micron to 30 microns
 inaki akruti saadharantah angreji bhashaa ke akshar s jaisi hoti hai
 Nucleo-proteins are mainly found in these
 pitrusutron ke kuch vishesh prakaar bhi paae jate hai, jinhen lampbrush pitrusutra or polotein chromosome kii sangya di gai he
 These are addressed by the names W, X, Y, Z, etc
 jeenon ko paitrik gunon kaa vaahak mana jaataa he
 Chromosomes or paternaries are made up of histone proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid
 jin kaa nirmaan inhen main se ek, di en e dwaara hota he
 When the cell divisions initiate the life of a new organism, these genes with ancestral and physiological properties move from the parents to the offspring
 yah aadan pradaan mata ke dimb tathaa pita ke shukranu main sthit jeenon ke dwaara sampann hota he
 In the month of June 1970, Indian scientist Mr
 Hargovind Khurana had an unprecedented success in generating artificial genes
 inhen san 1978 main nobel puraskaar mila tha
 These structures, obtained in the form of microscopic cells, can only be seen with an electron microscope
 inaki rachana 50% protein tathaa 50% aar en e dwaara hui hoti he
 These are found especially over the endoplasmic reticulum
 inamen proteinon kaa sanshleshan hota he
 Centrosomes - They are found near the nucleus
 inke ek vishesh bhaag ko centrosphere kehete hai, jiske bheetar centriolon kaa ek joda paaya jaataa he
 These dividers at the time of cell division determine the cell pole and in some cells generate flagellar-like structures
 lavak adhiktar paudhon main hi paae jate hai
 These are a type of pigment particles, which are scattered throughout the organism
 chlorophyl dharak varna ke lavak ko harith lavak kaha jaataa he
 Due to this, greenness is seen in the trees
 chlorophyl ke hi kaaran ped paudhe prakaash sanshleshan karte hai
 According to some scientists, the cells in the form of cytoplasmic heredity move directly into the progeny cells during cell division

 During the Middle Ages, Vlad Tapes used to be the Prince of Vallechia and Transylvania
 uske bachapan main, use shahi rajkumaron kii tarah automan samrajya kii ore se bandhak banaakar, unhen sultan kii jainisairi fouj main behaal karne laayak ek sipaahi kii tarah talim di jaati he, jo baad main ek bahadur yoddha banataa he
 He is given the title of Vladi Impeller after killing several thousand of his enemies at the point of the spear and putting them on the open ground
 halaaki use in khoonkhrabe se chidh ho jaati he, so in buree dino se chhudaane ke liye waapas aman kaayam karne kii koshish karata he
 One day in the jungles, Vlad and his soldiers find a helmet near the waterfall
 is dar se ki automan ke khoji dal raste main hamale kii phiraaq main hai, wo log jharne ke raaston se guzarakar "brokene tooth" naamak pahari kii oonchaai par basii gupha ja pahonchte hai
 As those people enter the cave, there is a pile of crushed bones lying on the ground like a carpet; And suddenly, in the dark, an unknown creature attacks them with red ruddy eyes, which has a lot of agility and strength than humans
 vlad ke kai saathi maare jate hai, phir vah gupha main hi padi talwaar se us saae ko zakhmi kar daalata he
 The sword with which Vlad killed the creature, he starts dissolving in the sun like his blood, and now he too gives up the pursuit of Vlad due to the sunlight at the mouth of the cave
 kile par uske vaapasi par, vlad ko sthaneey bhikshu se pataa chalata vah praani darasal ek pishaach he, jo kabhi insaan tha jise nark kii gaharaai se aae shaitan ne use talab kiya or bataur samjhaute apni kaali takatein saunpane se pehle shaitan ne chaal chali or usee gupha main sadaa rah jane kaa shaap de jate hue yah kahata he, ab vah tab reeha hoga jab koi uskaa lahu pie, uske baad vah kisi or insaan kaa khun pi jaae
 There is welcome of almost every person who in return for strength will also get freedom to take him out of the cave
 agle din, jab easter ke daavat par vlad apni bivi mirena, or bete ingerais, or apni praja saath lutf le rahaa tha, tabhi automan kii faujee tukdi vahaan kile par achaanak aa dhamakati he
 Vlad offers them silver coins as a reward in Khidmat, but according to the messenger, several soldiers are missing from the Ottoman platoon, guessing that Vlad may have killed them all
 vlad dambh bharte hue kisi kii bhi jaan lene ke maamle se inkaar karata he
 Then the messenger demands 1,000 boys with the reward of the Khidmat to be trained to advance the Sultanate by training Janissary
 vlad ise naamanzoor karata he, lekin faujee taadaad main kam or turkiyon ke baraabar naa hone par vah pareshaani main pad jaataa he
 Mirena is confident of this, as both Vlad and Mehmed have lived as childhood brothers in their childhood days, so it is advisable to talk on this matter, so that perhaps Mehmed will spare them Rahm
 mehmed dwitiya ke saamne hajir hokar vah mulk se or bachein naa de paane kii asamarthta jataata he
 Seeing the failure of the issue, he tries to present himself instead of the children; But the Sultan refuses this and demands to be handed over to Vlad's son
 tab sultan apane doot ko vlad ke bete ko laane bhejtaa he
 Vlad tells his wife on this issue that he is going to meet his son with the envoy and the Ottoman soldiers
 vlad tab mirena ko bharosa dilaataa he ki use or bacchon ko chhodane se pehle doot va uske sipaahiyon se akele main milane jaataa he
 See unarmed; Ingrace panics, following her, holds her hand and asks her father to approve the Sultan's entry into the army
 jyon hi vlad us turki doot ke paas, muskaraate hue pahunchataa he, to vlad usase kuch pareshaani hone kaa khed jaahir karata he
 Vlad tells his son to flee to the mother, and then snatches the messenger's sword and kills the soldiers surrounding him
 phir yah jaanate hue ki is harakat se use jang akhriyaar karnaa hoga, vlad us "brokene tooth" vaali pahaad par vaapis aakal us pishaach se madad kii darkaar karata he
 Then pushing one, the vampire asks for his reason for returning
 jawaab main vlad, uski pishaach kii shaktiyon ke dam par otoman fouj ko haraane kii baat kahata he
 The vampire then explains the outcome, and gives him his blood, which may grant Vlad the vampire powers temporarily
 use khabardaar karata he ki use teen dinon ke bheetar khud ko insaani lahu pine kii bechaini par kaabo rakhana hoga, tabhi vah waapas insaani rup main laut sakegaa
 Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever and one day he will have to ask for help from his own creator
 vlad yah prastaav kabool kar letaa he or pishaach kaa lahu pi jaataa he, jiske saath use dardanaak or maut se bhayanak ehsaas kii tabdiliyon saath guzarana padataa he
 Upon waking himself up in the wilderness, Vlad realizes that his sensory powers have already increased significantly, far more than humans in strength and speed, that he could even turn himself into bats
 But his skin is scorched in direct sunlight
 jab vah vaapis kaisel drakula pahunchataa he, otoman kii fouj hamalaa kar chuki hoti he, lekin vlad unpe akele hi tut padakar sabko maar daalata he
 Then he sends his subjects present in the fort to the monastery of Kozia, which is situated on the banks of the mountains, where they can find safe shelter
 is safar ke dauraan, mirena ko vlad ke shaapit hone kaa pataa tab maaloom hota jab vlad ek chaandi ke sikke ko dabaakar khud ko kamjor kar rahaa he taaki anbhigya logon ke najadik aane par unka khun pine ke liye hamalaa naa kar paae
 Vlad then swears that he will refrain himself from human blood, she agrees that he will regain immortality so that he can defeat the Ottomans
 par shkelgim naam kaa ek romany, ko vlad ke pishaach kaa pataa chalata he, is daawey ko pukhta karne ke liye vah naukar ke rup main use apana khun pine ko kahata he; lekin vlad inkaar karata he
 As soon as they reach near the monastery, the Ottoman soldier seated on the metal collapses on Valah; And by the time Vlad and his men manage to retreat, this sudden inhuman strength of Vlad changes the suspicion in his subjects
 agle din math main, vahaan ke bhikshuk ko shaap kaa pataa chalate hi vah rajkumaar or uske praja ko vlad ke khilaaf kar detaa he, jiske liye use dhoop main jalte ghar par fansaa diya jaataa he
 But the sun is covered with the soot of smoke, causing Vlad to escape from the fire, and the only reason to become his vampire in anger was to save his people from the Ottoman rule
 isse pehle ki aaveg main vah unke viruddh kuch karata, mirena use rokkar shant hone ko kahati he
 That same night, the Ottoman military procession moves towards the monastery
 vlad apni chamagadado ke vishaal jhund se unhen peeche khaded detii he, haalaanki un sipaahiyon ko pehle hi pralobhan de diya gaya tha, to unamem se mutthi bhar turki sipaahi math main ghus gaye or vahaan ke kai bashindon main markat machaakar ingerais ko aguva kar liya jaataa he
 Mirena tries to save her son, and falls from the high wall of the monastery
 marate hue, mirena yachana ke saath vlad ko suraj ugane se pehle uskaa lahu pine kahati jisase use apane bete ko bachaane kii takat mil jaae
 Vlad willingly has to drink his blood, which ultimately results in him becoming a full-fledged vampire and with which his powers are greatly increased at first
 vlad math kii ore lautataa he or vahaan pehre par baithe log se bhidate hue pishaach kii tarah jaanaleva waar karata he
 While on the Ottoman military camp, Mehmed prepares for an attack with a large army of Europe
 vlad or uski pishaach fouj pahunchakar katleam machaate dekh otoman ke sipaahi khaufjada ho jate hai, is bich vlad khud mehmed saamne hajir hota he, jo ingerais ko apni kaid main rakhaa tha
 Already attentive that the vampire's power is weakened by silver, Mehmed unleashes all the silver coins, removing the carpet lying on the floor of the cantonment, halting the strength and speed of Wlad, and then the advantage of his inattention
 After taking up his silver sword, he confronts Vlade
 vlad par uske haaavee hote hi, pehle se intjaam lakdi ke khunte se uskaa dil bedhan daalane kii koshish karata, lekin vlad chamagadado ke jhund main badalakar usase batch jaataa he phir "drakula, shaitan kaa betaa" kaa naam lekar, usee khunte se mehmed ko maar daalata he or uskaa khun pi jaataa he, apni is pashvik sthiti se upje crurata par vlad ghutane tech detaa he
 As he comes out of Mehmed's camp, Dracula and Ingeras are threatened by other vampires who surround him, and hand him over to his son for being human
 tabhi vahi bhikshu saamne aa jisane vailaah ke logon ko vlad ke khilaaf khadaa kiya or ab ek saleeb pakad kar un pishaachon ko peeche hataata he
 Just then when one of the vampires pounce on Ingeras, Dracula warns him not to harm his son by pounding him with a spear
 drakula us bhikshu se ingerais ko dur karne kaa hukum detaa he, phir apni shaktiyon ke bal par akaash par chhaae badalon ko hataa detaa he
 In the light of the sun, all the vampires are found in the dust, till then Dracula also collapses like a burnt corpse
 vlad ko mrit maan liya jaataa he or europe bhi otoman ke hamale se batch jaataa he, ingerais ko vailechia ke nae shahjade ke taur par taj-o-takht se nawaja jaataa he
 However, Schkelgim secretly revives Dracula's dead body by bringing it to a nearby camp and offering him blood
 phir vartmaan ke dinon main, vlad kii mulaakaat is aadhunik shahar kii sadak par minaa naam kii aurat se hoti he, jo bilkul use mirena kii yaad dilaati he, or baton baton main vah un kavita kii panktiyon ko doharaate hai jo unke bich hoti he
 At the same time, the vampire who cursed Vlad, now appears alive like normal humans, walks away from him, looking away from him, and says about the future of Dracula in the earlier plan, "then the spectacle begins

 In 2015, Fakruddin Bennur laid the foundation of the Maharashtrian Muslim Reservation Movement, this organization put forth the demands of the economic backwardness of the Muslims before the government, reservation in education, loan facility for small scale industries etc
, and many agitations took place across the state

 In the 1990s, he laid the foundation of the Muslim Marathi Sahitya Parishad
 The purpose of which was to increase communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims
 After 1980 in Maharashtra, Sh
 Bennur, F
 m Shahzinde, Javed Pasha, Baba Mohammad Atar, Aziz Nadaf etc
 The author-poet has brought the problems and questions of Muslims in Marathi to Marathi literature
 All of them had to say that why is there no interference of Muslims in the Marathi literature of the main stream? Why are Muslims being portrayed only negatively in Marathi literature? Supremacy of Muslim protest-filled 'colonial history' was being found in this literature, which Fakruddin Bennur and his collaborators laid the foundation of the Muslim Marathi Sahitya Parishad to introduce the new
 firoz shah tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 Ferozeshah Tughlaq was born on 1309
 wo bharat par antim muslim shaasha tha
 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule
 usne apane shasankaal main hi chaandi ke sikke chalaaye| firozshah tululaq, mohammad tululaq kaa chachera bhai evam sipahsalaar 'rajab' kaa putr tha
 His mother 'bibi Jaizella' was the daughter of Rajput chieftain Rajamal
 mohammad tululaq kii mutyu ke baad 20 march 1351 ko firoz tululaq kaa rajbhishak thatta ke nikat hua
 Feroze was crowned again in Delhi in August, 1351
 sultan banane ke baad firozshah tululaq ne sabhi qarze maaf kar die, jisamen 'sondhar rin' bhi shaamil tha, jo mohammad tululaq ke samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha
 After becoming Sultan, Feroze Tughlaq invaded Bengal and Sindh as part of his campaign to conquer his territories separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal ko jeetne ke liye sultan ne 1353 i
 main akraman kiya
 At that time, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was the ruler of that place
 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i
 main waapas dilli aa gaya
 Again in 1359 AD, Firuz Tughlaq attacked Sikandar Shah, the son of the then ruler Shamsuddin, in an attempt to take control of Bengal, but failed once again
 1360 i main sultan firoz ne ‘jajanagar’ par akraman karke vahaan ke shaasha bhanudev tritiy ko parrast kar puri ke jagannatha mandir puri ko dhwast kiya
 In 1361 AD, Feroze attacked Nagarkot
 yahan ke jambabaniyon se ladati hui sultan kii sena lagbhag 6 maheene tak ran ke registan main fasi rahi, kaalaantar main jambabaniyon ne sultan kii adheenta ko sweekaar kar liya or vaarshik kar dene ke liye sahamat ho gayi
 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya
 On the orders of the Ulama, the Sultan also imposed a new irrigation tax, which charged 1 / 10 of the produce
 sambhavtah firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal main lagaan upaj kaa 1 / 5 se 1 / 3 bhaag hota tha
 To facilitate irrigation, the Sultan built 5 big canals from the Yamuna River to Hisar, 150 miles long from the Sutlej River to the Ghaggar River, from the hill of Sirmour to the Hansi, from Ghaggar to Firozabad and from Yamuna to Firozabad
 usne falo ke lagbhag 1200 baag lagavaaye
 Abolished many taxes to increase internal trade
 nagar evam saarvajanik nirmaan kaaryon ke antargat sultan ne lagbhag 300 naye nagaron kii sthapana kii
 Among these, Hisar, Firozabad, Fatehabad, Jaunpur, Firozpur etc
 were prominent
 in nagaron main yamuna nadi ke kinare basaaya gaya firozabad sultan ko sarvaadhik priy tha
 The foundation of Jaunpur city was laid by Firoz in memory of his cousin 'fakhruddin Jauna'
 uske shashan kaal main khijrabad evam meerut se ashok ke do stambhalekhon ko laakar dilli main sthapit kiya gaya
 Under his welfare works, Firoz set up an employment office and a new department called diwan-e-khairat to help Muslim orphans, widows and girls
 'daarul-shafa' naamak ek rajkeey aspataal kaa nirmaan karavaaya, jisamen garibon kaa muft ilaaj hota tha
 During the reign of Firoz, the number of slaves reached about 1,80,000
 inaki dekhbhaal hetu sultan de 'dewan-e-bandaraan' kii sthapana kii
 Some slaves were sent to the provinces and the rest were kept in the center
 daason ko nakad vetan yaa bhukhand die gayi
 Slaves were also given handcraft training
 sainya vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne sainikon punah jaagir ke rup main vetan dena prarambh kar diya
 He made military posts hereditary, affecting the ability of soldiers to check
 khums kaa 4 / 5 bhaag phir se sainikon ko dene ke aadesh die gayi
 After some time his terrible result came to light
 firoz tululaq ko kuch itihaaskaar dharmandh evam ashishnu shaasha maanate hai
 Probably he was the first Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, who followed strict Islamic rules and gave importance to the Ulema class in administrative work
 nyaay vyavastha par punah dharmaguruon kaa prabhaav sthapit ho gaya
 Mukti used to explain the laws
 musalmaan aparaadhiyon ko mrityu dand dena band kar diya gaya
 Feroze was a staunch Sunni Muslim
 usne hindu janata ko ‘jimmy’ kaha or hindu brahmanon par jazia kar lagaaya
 Dr
 R
C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'
 firoz ne apni aatmakatha ‘phutuhat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kii jabaki ‘sirat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kisi agyaat viddhan dwaara kii gai he
 Firoz translated some of the 1300 texts looted from the library of the Jwalamukhi temple under the name 'dalaiyte-firozshahi' by Eduddin
 'valaile-firozshahi' ayurveda se sambandhit granth tha
 He invented the water clock
 firoz kaal main khan-i-jahaan telgani ke makbara kii tulana jerusalem main nirmit umr ke maszid se kii jaati he
 Sultan Firoz Tughlaq built Kotla Feroz Shah Durg in Delhi
 apane bhai jona khaan kii smriti main jonpur naamak shahar basaaya
 Sultan Ferozeshah Tughlaq himself encouraged bribery in the administration
 afif ke anusaar-sultan ne ek ghudsavaar ko apane khazaane se ek taka diya, taaki vah rishwat dekar arj main apane ghode ko paas karvaa saken
 Firoz Tuglaq was the first ruler of the Sultanate who got the details of the man of the state
 khwaja hisamuddin ke ek anumaan ke anusaar- firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal kii vaarshik aay 6 karod 75 lakh takaad Firoz Tughlaq issued a large number of coins made of a mixture of copper and silver under the currency system, which were probably called 'adha' and 'egypt'
 firoz tululaq ne ‘shanshgani’ kaa nayaa sikaa chalavaaya tha
 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya
 The rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq was based on welfare autocracy
 vah pratham sultan tha, jisne vijayon tathaa yudhon kii tulana main apni praja kii bhautik unnati ko shreshth sthaan diya, shaasha ke kartavyon kaa vistrut kiya tathaa islam dharm ko rajya shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 Henry Elliot and Elphinstone have called Firuz Tughlaq "akbar of the Sultanate era"
 firozshah tululaq kii safaltaaon kaa shrey uske pradhanmantri 'khan-e-jahaan makabool' kaa diya jaataa he
 Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq died in September 1388 AD

 In mathematics, 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ··· is an infinite series whose expressions are consecutive positive numbers with alternating symbols, that is, each expression's sign is opposite to its preceding expression
 shrenee ke pratham m padon kaa yoga sigma yoga nirupan kii sahaayta se nimnavat likhaa ja saktaa he: The infinite series divergence means that the sequence of its partial sum does not lead to a finite value
 baharhaal, 18veen shatabdi ke madhya main leonard islar ne virodhabhasi sameekaran main likhaa: But the significance of this equation was not clear until much later
 1980 ke purvarddh main arnesto sisera, emil borol tathaa anya ne apsaari shreniyon ko vyapak yoga nirdisht karne ke liye suparibhaashit vidhi pradaan kii— jisamen naveen islar vidhiyon kaa bhi ullekh tha
 The "sum" of 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 can be written 1⁄4 by various computation methods
 sisera-sankalan un vidhiyon main se ek he jo 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 kaa yoga praapt nahin kar sakati, atah shrenee ek aisa udhaaharan he jisamen thodi prabal vidhi yatha able sankalan vidhi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, Grandi is highly correlated with the range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + xxrep 4 
 islar ne in donon shreniyon ko shrenee 1 − 2n + 3n − 4n + 


 jahaan, kii vishesh avasthaa ke rup main adhyayan kiya or apane shodh kaary ko basal samasya tak vistaarit kiya
 Later his work resulted in the functional equation now known as Dirichle eta function and Reiman zeta function
 shrenee ke pad 0 kii ore agrasar nahin hai; atah 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 pad pareekshan vidhi se apsaari prathit hoti he
 Later, as a reference, it was also necessary to find out what is the basic level of series divergence
 By definition, the divergence or convergence of an infinite series is known by the divergence or convergence of the partial sum of that sequence
 is anukram kii vishistataa yah he ki isamen prayek purnank thik ek baar hi aata he— jisamen shunya bhi shaamil he
 If empty partials are compiled — thereby establishing the computation of z { \ displaystyle \ mathbb {Z}} from a set of integers
 aanshik yoga se yah spasht hota he ki shrenee kisi vishisht sankhya par abhisaran nahin karti 
 Hence 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 is divergent
 chunki pad 1, −2, 3, −4, 5, −6, 


 ek saral paddati ke anuroop hai atah shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 sthaan parivartan kar padwaar sankalit karke ek sankhyatmak maan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If it is possible to write s = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 for an ordinary number s, then the sum of the range s = 1⁄4 can be proved: atah s = 1 4 { \ displaystyle s={ \ frac {1}{4}}} kaa jyamitiya nirupan daayin ore ke chitra main darshaya gaya he
 Although 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 is not computable in the general sense, the equation s = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 = 1⁄4 is defined as the statement 'if such sum Can be supported with '
 kisi apsaari shrenee ke "yoga" kii vyapak paribhaasha ko sankalan vidhi yaa sankalaniyata vidhi kehete hai, jo sabhi sambhav shreniyon ke kuch upasamucchyon kaa yoga karti he
 There are various methods that display simple compilations
 uparokt vivechan se yah siddh hota he ki kisi di gai sankalaniyata vidhi se jo sthirataa evam raikhiktaa or shrenee 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 


 ko yoga karen, to iskaa parinami maan 1⁄4 hoga
 Additionally, since aisi paddatiyon se grandi shrenee 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 


 = 1⁄2 kaa bhi yoga kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1891, Ernesto Sisera wrote that "2 = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 can be written and its value is equal to 1⁄4" hoped that the divergent ranges also fit the calculus may be considered
 sisera ke liye yah sameekaran unke purv prakashit patr kii prameya kaa ek anuprayog tha jise apsaari shreniyon ke sankalan ke itihaas kii pratham gyaat prameya ke rup main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Their compilation method is described below; The main concept of which is that the range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


, range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 has a Cauchy product with range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + xxrep 4 
 do anant shreniyon kaa kosi gunanfal tab bhi paribhaashit he jab donon shreniyan apsaari hon
 In this case, where Σan = Σbn = Σn, the expressions of the Koshi product are given by a fixed diagonal sum: is sthiti main gunanfal shrenee nimnavat hogi: Hence, the compilation method following the Koshi product of two categories and the sum 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 = 1⁄2, will give the sum 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 


 = 1⁄4
