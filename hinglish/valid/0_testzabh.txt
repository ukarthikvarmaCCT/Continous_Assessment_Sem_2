 Tulu is a popular language in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts located in the western side of Karnataka state of India and in some parts of North Kerala
 pehle tulu brahman vaidic or sanskrit sahitya likhane ke liye 'tiglri' naamak lipi ko upyog karte the
 But very little literature is found in Tulu language
 par aaj is lipi ko jaananevaale bahut kam hai
 The old Tigallari script closely resembles the Malayalam script
 ab tulu likhane ke liye kannada lipi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This Panch is one of the Dravid languages
 dakshin kannada or udupi jilon kii adhikansh logon kii maatrubhaasha tulu he
 Hence, both these districts are collectively known as Tulunadu
 kerala ke kasargod jile main bhi bahut log tulu bhashaa bolte hai
 a Brahmin from Udupi district has composed a book named 'bhagavata' using the Tigari script
 kavi mandaar keshav bhat ne 'mandaar ramayana' naam kaa ek aadhunik mahakavy likhaa he
 According to linguists, there are four major forms or styles of tulu: shivalli - tulu brahmanon kii bolanewaali style
 Jains - The speaking style of Jains from the northern parts of Tulunadu
 saamaanya - tulunadu ke zyaadaatar logon kii bolanewaali style
 This style is used in commerce, art, entertainment
 adivasee - adivasee logon kii bolanewaali style
 According to some old Malayalam works, the area which spread from the Chandragiri River in Kasaragod to Gokarna in Uttara Kannada was known as Tulunadu
 par aaj kaa tulunadu dakshin kannada or udupi jilon tak hi simit he
 Nevertheless, many people who speak Tulu are found in Kasaragod in Kerala and Mumbai and Thana in Maharashtra
 vartmaan samay main tulubhashik sahitya likhane ke kaary main kannada lipi kaa upyog hota he

 sikh dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag The Dasam Granth is a Sikh scripture which is a collection of the sacred words and compositions of Satgur Gobind Singh Ji
 guru gobind singh ji ne apane jeevankaal main anek rachanaayen kii jinaki choti choti pothiyaan bana deen
 After his sacrifice, Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa and other Khalsa brothers collected all the works of Guru Gobind Singh ji by the orders of his religious wife Mata Sundari and put them in a book which is today called "dasam Granth"
 sidhe shabdon main kaha jaye to guru gobind singh ji ne rachana kii or khalse ne sampadanaa kii
 The entire Sikh community is entertained by the Dasam Granth

 In the gurudwaras of Takhat Hazur Sahib, Takhat Patna Sahib and Nihang Singh, the Dasam Granth is lighted with Guru Granth Sahib and is also taken daily
 dasam granth sahib ke hue sanathan tikon or arthon ke kaaran kuch sikh vidwan dasam granth ko satgur gobind singh kii rachana nahin maanate or guru granth sahib ke kuch shabdon ko bhi granthon main milawat kii drushti se dekhte hai
 Akal Takht has expelled all such scholars from the Sikh society, but their discussion continues on the Internet

 Due to these reasons, Pahari Raje and Brahmin began to envy Satgur Gobind Singh and started provoking the government against them

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Pythagorean theorem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 The Pythagorean theorem is a relation theorem between all three sides of a right triangle in Euclide geometry
 is prameya ko aamtaur par ek sameekaran ke rup main nimnlikhit tareeke se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he- Where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides
 pithagoras yunaan ke ganitagya the
 Traditionally, he is credited with the discovery of this theorem, although it is believed that the information of this theorem dates back to him
 bharat ke pracheen granth boudhayan shulbasutra main yah prameya diya hua he
 There is considerable evidence that the Babylonian mathematicians also knew this theory
 ise 'boudhayan-pithagoras prameya' bhi kehete hai
 If we take the length of the hypotenuse c and the length of the other two sides a and b, then the theorem can be expressed as the following equation: yaa, If c is already given and the length of one arm is to be derived, the following equation can be used: yaa This equation provides a simple relation between the three sides of a right-angled triangle
 is prameya kaa samanyikaran 'kojya niyam' kehalaata he jisaki sahaayta se kisi bhi trikon ke teesri bhujaa kii lambaai kii gananaa kii ja sakati he yadi shesh do bhujaaon kii lambaai or unke bich ke kone kii maap di gayi ho
 This is a theorem that has probably the most evidence compared to other theorems
 elisha scot loomis dwaara rachit paaythagorian theram kitaab main, 367 pramaan die gaye hai
 Like most of the proofs of the Boudhayan theorem, it is based on the property of being proportional to the arms of two identical triangles
 mana ABC ek samakon tribhuj he, jisamen kone c samakon he, jaisaa akruti main dikhaaya gaya he
 We draw a perpendicular to the hypotenuse from point c and the length of that length with arm AB is H
 yah nayaa trikon ACH hamaare trikon ABC ke samroop he, kyonki un donon main hi samakon he or a kone unka hissaa he
 This means that the third angle is also the same in both triangles
 isi aadhaar par tribhuj CBH bhi ABC ke samroop he
 From these analogies we get two proportions: jaise And inhen aise bhi likhaa ja saktaa he Summarizing these two equations, anya shabdon main, boudhayan prameya: In Euclid's Elements, Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Boudhayan theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines
 A, B, c ko samakon trikon ke kone maanate hai, jisamen samakon a par hoga
 a se karn ke vipareet ek adholamb chhoden varg main karn par
wo rekha karn par varg ko do aaayaaton main vibhajit karti he, prayek kaa samaan kshetra he kyunki donon main se ek pairon main varg banataa he
 For formal proof, we need four primary lemmata: is pramaan ke peeche sahaj vichaar, jo iskaa paalan karnaa aasaan bana saktaa he, ki upar ke do virgon ko ek hi aakaar ke samanaantar chaturbhuj main badla gaya he, phir modakar or baayen or daahine aayat ko nichle varg main badla gaya he, phir nirantar kshetra main
 The proof is as follows: yah pramaan euclid ke tatwon main prastaav 1
47 ke rup main pesh hota he
 James A
 Garfield is credited with a novel algebraic proof: puraa samalamb bai varg kaa aadha he, to uskaa kshetrafal = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 Each area of triangle 1 and triangle 2 is ab / 2
 trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal c2 / 2 he or yah karn par varg kaa aadha he
 But also the area of triangle 3 = - isliye karn par varg = anya do parshvon ke virgon kaa jod he
 In this proof, one can add 4 copies of square plus triangle on the hypotenuse as squares on the other two sides plus 4 copies of triangle
 This proof has been recorded from China
 upar euclid ke pramaan ke chitra se, ham teen samaan aankadon ko dekh sakate hai, prayek main "ek varg ke upar trikon" he
 Because the larger triangle is made up of two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of these two smaller ones
 samanta se, teen varg ek duusare ke saath usee anupaat main hai jaise vah teen trikon or isi tarah ke bade varg kaa kshetrafal do chote virgon ke kshetrafal kaa jod he
 Evidence from the anagram is given through illustration and animation
 is udhaaharan main, har ek bade varg kaa kshetrafal 2 he
 In both, the area of the same triangle is removed
 shesh kshetron, a2 + b2 or c2, baraabar hai
 QED yah pramaan vastav main bahut aasaan he, lekin yah praarambhik nahin he, is arth main ki yah keval sabase buniyadi siddhant or yucalidian jyamiti ke pramayon par nirbhar nahin he
 In particular, while it is very easy to give the formula for the area of triangles and squares, it is not easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of the areas of its pieces
 vastav main, aavashyak gun sabit karnaa paaythagorian prameya siddh karne kii tulana main kathin he 
vastav main, yah kathinaayee sabhi saadhaaran kshetra shaamil yucalidian pramaan ko prabhavit karata he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek samakon trikon kaa kshetra paane ke liye ek dharna shaamil he ki yah ek hi oonchai or tal ke ek aayat kaa aadha kshetra he
 For this reason, axiomatic introduction to geometry generally uses another proof based on the similarity of triangles
 is paaythagorian prameya kaa teesraa graphic chithran main karn kaa varg parshvon ke varg main feet baithta he
 a related proof may show that the restored parts are identical to the original and, because the sum of the same is the same, that their areas are also the same
 yah dikhaane ke liye kii ek varg hi parinaam he, hame nae parshvon kii lambaai ko c ke baraabar dikhaanaa padegaa
dhyaan den kii is pramaan ke kaam karne ke liye, hame chote varg ko or adhik hisson main kaatane ke tareeke ko sanbhaalane ke liye rasta pradaan karnaa hoga chunki parshv or chote hote jaayenge
 The algebraic variation of this proof is provided by the following argument
 chithran ko dekhte hue jo ek bada varg he jiske konon main samaan samakon trikon he, in chaar trikon main prayek kaa kshetra c ke saath ek kone ke dwaara diya gaya he
 The A-lateral angles and B-lateral angles of these triangles are the supplementary angles, each of the angles of the blue region are right angles, making this area a square whose side length is C
 is varg kaa kshetrafal he C2
is tarah samast kaa kshetra diya jaataa he: However, the length of the sides of the larger square is a + B, we can calculate its area as 2, which extends into A2 + 2AB + B2
 boudhayan prameya main pahunchaa ja saktaa he nimnlikhit chitra ke adhyayan se kii ek parshv main parivartan kaise karn main ek parivartan ke utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek thoda kalan kaa upyog karke
 As a result of the change in side of a, da, trikon kii samanta or antar main badlaav ke liye
isliye On the separation of variables
 parshv b main parivartan ke liye ek doosraa kaarykaal jodne kaa parinaam he
 Consolidated returns jab a = 0 tab c = b, to b2 "nirantar" he
 So jaise dekha ja saktaa he, parivartan or parshvon ke bich vishesh anupaat ke kaaran he yah varg jabaki parshvon main parivartan kii swatantra yogadan kaa parinaam raashi he jo jyamitiya saakshyon se spasht nahin he
 From this given ratio it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides
 is vibhedak sameekaran suzav detaa he kii yah prameya sambandhit parivartan ke kaaran he or iske vyutpatti lagbhag line abhinn abhikalan ke samaan he
 This quantity da and dc are very small changes in a and c respectively
 lekin ham iske badale vaastavik sankhya Δa and Δc kaa upyog karte hai, tab unke anupaat kii seemaa da / dc he jab unka aakaar shunya nikatataa, vyutpanni or c / a bhi nikatataa he, trikon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa anupaat or vibhedak sameekaran kaa parinaam pataa chalata he
 The antonym of this theorem is also true: kisi bhi teen dhanatmak sankhya a, b or c aisi he a2 + b2 = c2, vahaan ek trikon maujuud he jiske parshv hai a, b or c or har aise trikon main parshvon ke bheech ek samakon he jinaki lambaai a or b he
 This antonym is present in the elements of Euclid
 kosine kii vidhi kaa prayog karke yah sabit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa nimnlikhit pramaan ke dwaara: Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are a, b and c, with a2 + b2 = c2
 We have to prove that the angles between a and b sides are right angles
 ham ek or trikon kaa nirmaan karte hai jisamen parshvon ke bich ek samakon he jisaki lambaai a or b he
 From the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse length of this triangle is also c
 chunki donon trikon ke parshvon kii ek hi lambaai he a, b or c, ve anukool hai or isliye unka ek hi kone hona chahie
isliye, jin parshvon kii lambaai a or b he hamaare mul trikon main unke bich kaa kone ek samakon he
 An approximation of the inverse of the Pythagorean theorem is a simple way of determining if a triangle is right-angled, obtuse, or acute, thus
 Where c is chosen as the longest of the three sides: ek paaythagorian tripal main teen sakaaratmak purnank hai a, b or c, jaise kii a2 + b2 = c2
anya shabdon main, ek paaythagorian tripal ek samakon ke parshvon kii lambaai kaa varnan karata he jahaan teenon parshv kii purnank lambaai he
 Evidence from large stone monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triplets were known before the discovery of writing

 According to legend, Hippasus, who first proved the irrationality of the square root of two, was drowned at sea as a result
 kaatizian nirdeshaank main duurastha formula ko paaythagorian prameya se se praapt kiya gaya he
 If and are points in the square, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by atirikt saamanytah se, yucalidian main n-antar, do binduon ke bich kii yucalidian duuri, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,} or a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ ,= \ ,}, paaythagorian prameya kaa upyog karte hue, paribhaashit kiya gaya he: The Boudhayan theorem was generalized among Euclid's elements: agar koi ek samaan aankade khadaa karata he ek samakon trikon ke parshvon main, to do chhoton ke kshetron kaa jod bade ke kshetrafal ke baraabar he
 The Baudhayan theorem is a special case of the more general theorem related to the length of the sides, the method of cosine: is jatil aantarik utpaada antariksh main do vector v or w diya jaae, to boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit rup le leti he: In particular, || v + w || 2 = || v || 2 + || w || 2 if v and w are rectangles, although the antonym is not necessarily true

 Therefore, a2 + b2> c2

 Therefore, a2 + b2 <c2 occurs

 Is shown to be equivalent to self-respect
 ) udhaaharan ke liye, goleey jyamiti main, octate se simit ikai kshetra ke samakon trikon ke teenon parshvon kii lambaai π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} ke baraabar he; yucalidian paaythagorian prameya kaa ulanghan karti he kyunki π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} This means that in the Euclidean theorem, the Pythagorean theorem must take a different form from the Euclidean theorem
 Here two cases have to be considered - spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; In every case, like the Euclidean case, the law of proper cosine results in: ek gola jisaki trigya r he usapar koi bhi samakon trikon ke liye, paaythagorian prameya yah rup letaa he This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines
 is kosine samaaroh ke liye mcclaurin shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karke, yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki trigya r anantta tak pahunchataa he, ke rup main he, paaythagorian prameya kaa golakaar rup yucalidian rup tak pahunchataa he
 For any triangle in this hyperbolic plane, the Pythagorean theorem takes this form jahaan cosh ke atishyoktipurna kosine he
 Using the mclaurin series for this function, it can be shown that the exaggerated form of the Pythagorean theorem is closely related to the Euclidean form, as the hyperbolic triangle becomes very small
 atishyoktipurna jyamiti main, ek samakon trikon ke liye bhi likhaa ja saktaa he, Where a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} is the angle of equality of the line segment now that a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} where μ is the multiplication distance function
 atishyoktipurna trikonmiti main, sin ke kone kii samanta santusht karata he Thus, this equation takes the form jahaan a, b, and c samakon trikon ke parshvon kii ganaatmak dooriyaan hai 
 The distance between the points {and {in 3 dimensions is √2 + 2)] 2 + 2) = √2 + 2 + 2) and similarly for 4 or more dimensions

 The history of this theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of the Pythagorean triple, knowledge of the relationship between right triangle triangles, knowledge of the relationship between adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem

 In addition, many affiliate solution providers hope to increase revenue by using affiliate marketing with business-to-business marketers and advertisers

 The new media has facilitated traders to come closer to their affiliates and improve communication between them
 aaj assi pratishat sambhddha program aay sahbhaajan yaa laagat prati vikray ) kaa prayog kshatipurti tareeke ke rup main karte hai, unniis pratishat laagat prati kaary ) evam shesh anya program anya tareekon jaise ki laagat prati clic ) yaa laagat prati mile ) kaa prayog karte hai
 In more mature markets, less than one percent of traditional affiliate marketing programs currently use cost per click) and cost per mile)
 haalanki, in kshatipurti tareekon kaa disple vigyaapan evam bhugtan khoj main badi maatra main prayog ho rahaa he
 For the cost per mile, it is only necessary that the publisher makes the advertisement available on their website and display it to the visitors so that commission can be received
 Cost-per-click requires an additional step in the conversion process for a publisher to make a profit: a visitor is not only required to make one ad aware, but also to click on the ad to visit the publisher's website
 Is important sambhddha vipanan ke praarambhik dinon main laagat prati clic saamanytah adhik prachlit tha, lekin samay ke saath iskaa prayog kam hota gaya kyonki isamen dhokhadhadi purna clic maamle drushtigochar huye jaise ki vartmaan main aadhunik search ingine main clic dhokhadhadi maamle dikhaai de rahe hai
 Referral advertising programs are not included in the statistic due to the decreasing use of cost per click, as it is uncertain whether referenced advertising can be considered affiliate marketing
 yadhyapi paripakv i-commers evam online vigyaapan bazaaron main ye model kam ho gayi hai, lekin ye kuch navjaat udyogon main abhi bhi prachlit hai
 China is an example where affiliate marketing does not match this model of the West
 Many affiliates are getting paid at the "cost per day" rate and some networks are offering cost per click or CPM
 laagat prati mile / clic ke maamle main, shrota sadsy hone ke kaaran prakaashak kisi aagatuk ke bare main frickmand nahin rahata jise ki vigyapandaata aakarshith karne kaa prayaas karata he tathaa roopantarit karne main safal hota he, kyonki is samay tak prakaashak ko apana kamishan praapt ho chukaa hota he
 This puts the advertiser at full risk and loss in terms of cost and cost per mile
 laagat prati kaary / vikray tareekon main sambhddha ko kamishan prapti hetu vigyapandaata kii website par aagatuk ko bhraman ke atirikt bhi kaary karnaa hota he
 The advertiser must first convert the visitor
 It is in the best interest of the affiliate to send the most targeted traffic to the advertiser in order to increase the likelihood of conversion
 There is an equal distribution of risk and loss between the affiliate and the advertiser 
 sambhddha vipanan ko "nishpaadan vipanan " bhi kaha jaataa he, visheshkar vikray carmikon ko kshatipurti pradaan karne ke sambandh main
 in carmikon ko unke prayek vikray hetu kamishan kaa bhugtan kiya jaataa he evam kabhi-kabhi unhen lakshya kii purti kar lene par nishpaadan protsaahan bhi pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Affiliates are not employed by the advertiser to promote their products and services, but the compensation model applied in affiliate marketing is quite similar to that used by individuals in the advertiser's internal sales department
 yah kahawat ki "sambhddha vyakti aapke vyapaar hetu vistaarit vikray shakti hai", jise sambhddha vipanan kii vyakhya hetu praayah prayog kiya jaataa he, purnatah sateek nahin he
 The primary difference between these two is that affiliate marketers have little impact on the conversion process of any potential customer directed to the advertiser's website
 vigyapandaata kii vikray team kaa, haalanki, sambhavit graahak par tab tak niyantran evam prabhaav hota he, jab tak ki vah theke par hastakshar yaa kray purna na kar le
 Some advertisers propose a multi-tier program that distributes commissions in a hierarchically referenced network of sign-ups and subpartners
 vyaavhaarik arthon main, prakaashak "e" ek vigyapandaata ke program main sin-ap karata he evam sanderbhit aagatuk dwaara sanchalit sahamat gatividhi hetu puraskrit hota he
 If publisher "A" attracts publisher "B" and "C" in the same program using its sign-up code, then all future activities of publisher "B" and "C" are additional to publisher "A" Will provide commission
 bahut kam sambhddha prograamon main dwi-tear program astitv main hote hai, zyaadaatar ek-tear hai
 Programs referenced beyond two-tier are similar to multi-level marketing) or network marketing, but there are differences
 multi level vipanan ) yaa network vipanan main kamishan kaa bhugtan praapt karne hetu adhik paatratayen / aavashyaktaayen hoti hai
 Whereas affiliate programs do not
 vyapaaree sambhddha vipanan kaa samarthan karte hai kyonki adhiktar maamalon main yah "nishpaadan hetu bhugtan" adarsh kaa prayog karte hai, jiskaa arth yah hota he ki vyapaaree, jab tak parinaam nahin nikaalte vipanan kharch nahin karata he
 Many business groups attribute the maximum success to this marketing technique, the famous example of which is Amazon
com

 Some merchants operate affiliate programs on their own using popular software while others use third party services provided by middlemen to track traffic or sales referred to by affiliates
 Merchants can choose from two different types of affiliate management solutions: stand alone software or hosted services, primarily called affiliate networks
 sambandhon athwa prakashkon ko bhugtan yaa to vyapaaree kii ore se network dwaara sabhi vyapaariyon ko ek saath kiya jaataa he, jahaan par ki prakaashak ke sambandh ho tathaa kamishan kamaaya ho, athwa vyapaaree dwaara swayan hi kiya jaataa he
 Successful affiliate programs require significant work and maintenance
 safal sambhddha program ko banaaye rakhana adhik kathin hota he, bajaae iske ki jab yah program bilkul praarambhik sthiti main hote hai
 With the exception of a few vertical markets, it is hardly possible for affiliate programs to generate sufficient capital without weak management or management
 aniyantrit sambhddha prograamon ne aise kapati sambandhon ko sahaayta di he tathaa aaj bhi jari rakhe hue he jo spaming, trade mark kaa ulanghan, jhuthe vigyaapan, "kukiz kating", typo squating kaa prayog tathaa anya aniatik kriyaayein karte hai jo ki sambhddha vipanan ko nakaaratmak pratishtha dete hai
 The increasing number of internet businesses and the increasing number of people who believe in the latest technology of doing business online helps in further strengthening affiliate marketing
 samaan gunvattta tathaa aakaar se bhare vyast bazaar main vyapaaree ko laabh kamaane evam alag se pahachaane jane main kathinaayee hoti he
 In this environment, however, detection may be more beneficial
 haal hi main, internet vipanan udyog adhik aadhunik ho gaya he
 Online media has also become sophisticated in some areas, like offline media, in which advertisements are broadly commercial and competitive
 aisi kai mahatvapurn aavashyaktaaain he jinhen vyapaariyon ko safal hone ke liye puraa karnaa hi chaiye, tathaa ye aavashyaktaaain in-house puraa karnaa vyapaariyon ke liye atyadhik bojhil ho rahaa he
 a growing number of merchants are finding alternative options in relatively new outsourced program management companies, often established by experienced affiliate managers and network program managers
 opiem companiyaan seva ke rup main vyapaariyon ke liye sambhddha program prabandhan karti hai, jis tarah vigyaapan companiyaan of line vipanan kii tarah kisi brand tathaa utpaada ko protsaahan detii hai
 Relationship web sites are often classified by merchants and affiliate networks
 vartmaan main vargeekaran ke liye koi udyoganusaar sweekrut maanak nahin he
 The following types of web sites are common, but still commonly understood and used by affiliate merchants
 sambhddha network, jisamen pehle se hi kai prakaashak hote hai, main prakashkon kaa badha samooh bhi hota he
 These publishers are presumably appointed, and it is also likely that the publishers of the network apply to the program themselves, without the need for an effort by the advertisers to appoint
 sambandhit website, jo vigyaapan daata ke rup main usee lakshith shrotaaon ko aakarshith karti he, parantu uske saath bagaiyr pratiyogita ke, sambhavya sambhddha partner hote hai
 Vendors or existing customers can also be selected, if there is some benefit from doing this and there is no violation of any law and rules
 praayah koi bhi web site ek sambhddha prakaashak ke rup main chaynit kii ja sakati he, yadhyapi is baat kii adhik sambhaavna he ki adhik vyast websiten kam-jokhim laagat prati mile athwa madhyam-jokhim laagat prati clic saude main atyadhik-jokhim laagat prati kaary athwa rajasav hisse ke saude kii tulana main ruchi rakh sakati hai
 There are three main ways to locate the location of an affiliate program for a targeted web site: yadi uparyukt sthal sambhddha ke bare main jaankaree pradaan nahin karte to aisa ho saktaa he ki yah gaiyr-janata sambhddha program ho
 yah soochna praapt karne kaa sabase acha tarika he ki sidhe website swami se sampark kiya jaye
 Since the time of affiliate marketing, there is little control over affiliate actions
 beyimaan sambandhon dwaara spalm, jhuthe vigyaapan, kritrim clic, adware tathaa anya vidhiyon kaa prayog unke praayojakon kii ore boj ko badhaane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Although the terms of service of many affiliate programs contain rules against spam, historically this marketing method has been proven to attract wrongful activities by spammers
 sambhddha vipanan ke praarambhik kaal main kai internet prayoktaaon kii iske bare main nakaaratmak raay thi kyonki sambhddha praayah apane namit program ko protsaahit karne ke liye spalm kaa prayog karte the
 As affiliate marketing has strengthened, many affiliate merchants have refined their terms and conditions to prohibit affiliates from spamming
 jaise hi search ingine adhik mahatvapurn hua, kuch sambhddha vipanakon ne i-mail spalm bhejne ke sthaan par swachaalit rup se srujit web pejes ko banane kii ore apane ko sthaanantarit kar liya he jisamen vyapaariyon dwaara pradutt utpaada data feed praayah nihit hota he
 The goal of such web pages is to alter the relevance or specificity of the resources indexed by the search engine known as spam dexing
 prayek prishth ko vishisht kiward ke prayog ke dwaara vibhinn behatar bazaar main lakshith kiya ja saktaa he jiskaa parinaam search ingine optimigeshan kaa visham prakaar hota he
 Spam is the biggest threat to the organic search engine, which aims to provide quality search results for the keywords or statements entered by their users
 2006 main google kaa pej renk kalan vidhi apadet - google pramukh apadet kaa antim charan jo madhya greeshm 2005 main prarambh hua, ne baari safalataa ke saath vishesh rup se spamdexing par lakshya kiya tha
 This update enabled Google to remove most computer-generated duplicate content from its index
 adhiktar sambhddha link nihit web citen gunavaktaa purna saamagree kii kam aapurti ke liye purv main nakaaratmak prasiddhi rakhti thim
 In 2005, Google made effective changes to it, in which some web sites were labeled "weak-affiliate"
 is tarah kii web citon ko yaa to google ke index se hataa diya gaya athwa parinaam pej main punah sthapit kiya gaya 
 is vargeekaran se bachane ke liye, sambhddha vipanak web masters ko unki website par gunvatttapurna saamagree srujit kerani chaiye jo unke kaary evam spamars athwa binar farms ke kaary main antar kar sake, jo keval vyapaariyon kii citon ke liye sampark kaa madhyam hoti hai
 Some announcers originally suggested that links to affiliates work well in the context of information contained within the web site itself
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi kisi web site main kisi website prakaashan kii soochna nihit hoti he, to vyapaaree kii website kii saamagree main hi internet seva pradaata ke liye sambhddha link upyukt hoga
 yadi kisi website main khelkud se sambandhit jaankaree nihit hoti he to khelkud ke bare main koi sambhddha link, khelon kii vastuon tathaa soochna ke sandarbh main acha kaary kar sakate he
 In this case the aim is to publish quality information in the website itself and provide a context-oriented link to the website of the merchants concerned
 yadhyapi, adhik naveenatam udhaaharan kamjor - sambhddha site kaa he jo ki seva pradaan karne ke dwaara upabhoktaaon hetu mulya srujit karne ke liye sambhddha vipanan model kaa prayog kar rahe he
 These vulnerable content service associations are classified into the following three categories: yadhyapi yah spivir se bhinn he, parantu edwear unheen vidhiyon tathaa praudyogikiyon kaa prayog karata he
 Traders were initially unaware of the effect of the adware and how much damage it would do to their brand
 Affiliate marketers soon became aware of this issue, particularly for the reason that they found that adware tracking often rewrote on cookies which led to a reduction in commission
 edwear ko lagu nahin karne vaale sambandhon ne paaya ki vah unase kamishan kii chori kar rahaa he
 Often, adware has no important purpose, and it rarely provides useful content to the consumer, who is particularly unaware that such software is installed on their computer
 sambandhon ne masalon par internet forum main vichaar-vimarsh kiya tathaa prayaason ko sangathit karnaa prarambh kiya
 He believed that the best way to get rid of this problem should be to discourage merchants from advertising through advertising
 Those merchants who were indifferent to or supportive of the adware were exposed by the affiliates, which damaged the reputation of those merchants and hampered their affiliate marketing efforts
 Many affiliates either ended up using such merchants or joined the competitor's affiliate program
 antatogatva, sambhddha networkon par vyapaariyon evam sambandhon dwaara samuchit kadam uthaane hetu evam apane network se nishchit edwear prakashkon ko pratibandhit karne ke liye dabaav daalaa gaya
 The result was a complete ban of software applications as a medium for affiliates to promote advertising offers by Commission Junction / b Free and performance by Code of Conduct, Link Shares' anti-violence Advertisement Appendix, and Share a Sales

 Affiliates were among the earliest adopters of pay-per-click advertising when the first pay-per-click search engine emerged in the late 1990s
 2000 ke ant main google ne apni bhugtan prati clic seva, ], prarambh kii jo ki vigyaapan channel ke rup main bhugtan prati clic ke vyapak prayog tathaa sweekruti ke liye uttaradaayi he
 The growing number of merchants involved in pay-per-click advertising, either directly or through a search marketing agency, felt that this place was already well-occupied by their affiliates
 yadhyapi, is akeli sthiti ne vigyaapan daataaon tathaa sambandhon ke madhya vigyaapan channel sangharsh tathaa vaad vivaad paidaa kar diya he, sabase bada masalaa vigyaapan daataaon ke naam, brands tathaa trademarkon kii sambhddha boli se sambandhit tha
 Many advertisers started adjusting their affiliate program terms to prevent their affiliates from bidding on those types of keywords
 Some advertisers, however, have accepted this behavior and are still doing so, even allowing affiliates to bid on advertiser's trademarks rather than promoting them
 sambhddha vipanan aise udhyamiyon dwaara chalaaye jate hai jo internet vipanan ke yug main kaary kar rahe hai
 Affiliates are often the first to take advantage of emerging trends and technologies
 sambhddha vipanakon hetu parichaalan vidhiyon ke varnan kaa sabase acha maarg "trial and erar" tarika he
 This risky approach may be one of the reasons why most affiliates, who have the potential to generate commissions of US $ 10,000 or more per month, fail or stop trying before they become "super affiliates"
 aise samudaayon main paye jane vaale vyavhaar ke saath sammishrit yah sarahadi jivan hi shaayad mukhya kaaran he ki sambhddha vipanan udyog vigyapandaataaon tathaa sambandhon ke madhya vyaktigat thekon ke pare swaniyaman main kyon asamarth he
 Affiliate marketing has experienced many unsuccessful attempts to create some type of industry organization or association that may be the initiator of regulations, standards and guidelines for the industry
 sambhddha union tathaa aieefeme asafal niyaman prayaason ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 On-line forums and industry trade are the only one to gather various members of the display industry such as - Affiliate / Publisher, Merchant / Advertiser, Affiliate Network, Third Party Vendor and Service Provider such as External Processed Program Manager, etc
 Are means
 online forums nishulk, chote sambandhon ko badi aawaaj pradaan karne main samarth hai tathaa gumnami pradaan karte hai
 These are price-prohibitive for small affiliates due to the high price of trade show show admissions
 bade sambhddha unako protsaahit karne vaale vigyapandaata dwaara pryojit ho sakate hai
 Due to the anonymity of online forums, the numerical plurality of industry members is unable to formulate any legally binding rules or laws which should be followed throughout the industry
 Online forums had very few successes as representing the majority of the affiliate marketing industry
 aisi safalataa kaa atyadhik naveenatam udhaaharan june / july 2006 main "kamishan jankshan link management inishiative" ) kaa viraam tha jab ekal network ne apane sambandhon par saadhaaran achtmal ke prati sthaapan ke rup main javascript trekking code ke prayog ko thopane kaa prayaas kiya
 Currently there is a lack of industry standards for training and certification in affiliate marketing
 aise kuch paathyakram tathaa seminar he jo parinamtah abhipramann karte hai; yadhyapi, aise abhipramann kii sweekruti adhiktar abhipramann karne vaale vyakti athwa company kii pratishtha ke kaaran hoti he
 Affiliate marketing is not normally taught in universities and very few college teachers work with internet marketers to introduce the subject to students studying in marketing
 shiksha praayah "vaastavik jivan" main samay vyateet hone ke saath-saath praapt hoti he
 While there are many books on this title, some so-called books "how to" or "silver Bullet" direct readers to manipulate the flaws in the Google algorithm, which can quickly become obsolete, or advertisers Suggest policies not further supported or disallowed by outsource program prabandhan companiyaan apane adhiktar prashikshan samooh sahyog tathaa buddhishiltaa ke madhyam se aupchaarik tathaa anaupchaarik prashikshan ko jodatii he
 Such companies try to send every marketing employee to their own industry conferences of their choice
 anya prayukt prashikshan sansadhano main online forums, weblogs, podcostus, prayog kiye gayi video seminar evam visheshgy website shaamil hai
 The affiliate conference is the largest conference in the industry and many other affiliate networks organize their own annual events
 online vigyaapan hetu abhyaason ko nirdeshit karne tathaa nitishashtra ke maanakon ke paalan hetu disambar 2002 main effiliet network kamishan jankshan / bi free evam parformics dwaara aachaar samhita jari kii gayi thi
 Cost per action can be seen as a threat to the "classic" affiliate marketing network
 paramparaagat sambhddha vipanan sansaadhan-gahan hota he tathaa use nirantar rakh-rakhaav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most maintenance involves administration, supervision and support to the affiliates
 sambhddha vipanan kaa lakshya vigyaapan daataaon tathaa sambandhon ke madhya ddeerghavidhi tathaa aapasi laabhakaari saajhedaari kii ore nirdeshit he
 The cost per action network, however, eliminates the need to build and maintain an advertiser's relationship with affiliates, since that work is done by the cost per action network for the advertiser
 vigyapandaata ek ofer detaa he, adhiktar hameshaa hi sipie -aadhaarit tathaa laagat prati kaary network us ofer ko protsaahit karne ke liye uske sambandhon ko sangathit karke shesh prakriya ko sambhalata he
 Cost-per-sale and revenue sharing are the major compensation models for classic affiliate marketing, and are rarely found in cost-per-work networks
 sambhddha vipanak laagat prati kaary network ke sheershak se vishesh rup se bachate he; yadhyapi, yadi is par vichaar vimarsh kiya jaataa he to vaad-vivaad garm tathaa visphotak ho sakate hai
 Members of the marketing industry are recommending that "affiliate marketing" be replaced by an alternative name
 sambhddha vipanan ko praayah network vipanan athwa bahu-stareey vipanan samajha jaataa he
 Performance marketing is a common option, but other recommendations have also been made
 april 2008 main, neuyark rajya ne amejon ke neuyark aadhaarit website se sambhddha linkon ke astitv ke aadhaar par amejondotcom dwaara neuyark ke nivaasiyon ko kiye gayi vikray par vikray kar adhikaar kshetra par jor dete hue ek mad rajya ke bajet main shaamil kii

 Amazon challenged the amendment and in January 2009 had to face defeat in court
 The case is currently in New York Reconsideration Court

 This not only creates fraudulent affiliate sales, but has the potential to be rewritten in other cookies networks by stealing legitimate commissions from them
 kai vauchar code website prarup ko prakat karne ke liye clic kaa prayog karte he jisamen website upyogkarta ko vauchar code ko bhedane hetu clic karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The action of clicking places cookies on the website visitor's computer
 yabi ne kaha he ki "sambandhon ko aise kisi tantra kaa prayog nahin karnaa chaiye; jisamen upyogkarta aisi saamagree ke saath intarect karne ke liye clic karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaye jahaan yah aspasht tathaa bhramit he ki uskaa parinaam kya hoga
" Saraswati is a mythical river which is also mentioned in the Vedas
 rugveda main saraswati kaa annavati tathaa udakvati ke rup main varnan aayaa he
 This river was always full of water and food had a rich origin on its banks
 kehete hai, yah nadi punjab main sirmurrajya ke parvatiy bhaag se nikalakar ambala tathaa kurukshetra hoti hui karnal jila or patiala rajya main pravisht hokar sirsa jile kii drushdwati nadi main mil gai thi
 In ancient times, this combined river had flooded many sites of Rajputana
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki prayag ke nikat tak aakaar yah ganga tathaa yamuna main milakar triveni ban gai thi
 Over time, it disappeared from all these places, yet people believe that in Prayag it still flows intermittently
 manusanhita se spasht he ki saraswati or drushadwati ke bich kaa bhubhag hi brahmavart kehalaata tha
 The Saraswati River is one of the main Hindu rivers and the main rivers mentioned in the Rigveda
 rugveda ke nadi sookt ke ek mantra main saraswati nadi ko 'yamuna ke purv' or 'sutluj ke pashchim' main bahati hui bataaya gaya he uttar vaidic granthon, jaise tandya or jaimineey brahman main saraswati nadi ko marusthal main sookhaa hua bataaya gaya he, mahabharatamen bhi saraswati nadi ke marusthal main 'vinaashan' naamak jagah par vilupt hone kaa varnan aata he
 In the Mahabharata, the Plakshavati River, Vedasmriti, Vedavati etc
 of Saraswati River have many names
 mahabharat, vayupurana adi main saraswati ke vibhinn putron ke naam or unase jude myth praapt hote hai
 In the Mahabharata, shanti-parva, shanti-parva, or Vayu Purana, myths related to the Saraswati river and the son of Dadhichi Rishi meet with slight differences, he has been extended by Sanskrit Mahakavi Banabhatta in his book 'harshacharitha'
 vah likhte hen- " ek baar baarah varsh tak varsha na hone ke kaaran rishigan saraswati kaa kshetra tyaag kar idhar-udhar ho gaye, parantu mata ke aadesh par saraswati-putr, saraswatey vahaan se kahin nahin gaya
 Then, when the sage returned, when he had a drought, he had forgotten all the Vedas etc
 unke aagrah kaa maan rakhte hue saraswatey ne unhen shishy rup main sweekaar kiya or punah shrutiyon kaa paath karavaaya
 ashwaghosh ne apane 'buddhacharit'kavy main bhi isi katha kaa varnan kiya he
 In the third chapter of 'kavyamimamsa', a famous tenth scholar Rajasekhar has given a poetic myth that when Saraswati meditated on the Himalayas with the desire to have a son, Brahma pleased and created a son named for him
 - poetry man
 As soon as Kavipurusha is born, she says in the prayer of Mata Saraswati in the verse - o Mother, i pray your son Kavyapurusha, by which the entire universe is transformed into meaning
 

" Based on the references to the Saraswati river in the Rig Veda and other mythological Vedic texts, many geologists believe that the existing dry ghaggar-hakra river flowing through Rajasthan from Haryana was a main tributary of the ancient Vedic Saraswati river, which dates back to 5000-3000
 BCE flowed all over
 us samay sutluj tathaa yamuna kii kuch dharaaen saraswati nadi main aa kar milti thim
 Apart from this, two other missing rivers, Sarswadi and Hiranyavati were also tributaries of Saraswati, Yamuna, Satluj changed its course due to geological changes till about 1900 BCE and Saraswati river also disappeared as Sravasti river dried up in 2600 BCE
 It is done
 rugveda main saraswati nadi ko nadeetama kii oopaadhi di gayi he
 Saraswati was the largest and main river in Vedic civilization
 isro dwaara kiye gayi shodh se pataa chalaa he ki aaj bhi yah nadi haryana, punjab or rajasthan se hoti hui bhumigat rup main pravaahman he
 Saraswati was a huge river
 pahaado ko todatii hui nikalati thi or maidaanon se hoti hui arab sagar main jaakar villin ho jaati thi
 Its description appears repeatedly in the Rigveda
 kai mandalon main iskaa varnan he
 It always had water in the Rigveda Vedic period
 saraswati aaj kii ganga kii tarah us samay kii vishaltam nadiyon main se ek thi
 During the later Vedic period and Mahabharata period this river had dried up a lot
 tab saraswati nadi main pani bahut kam tha
 But during the rainy season it used to get water
 bhugarbhi badlaav kii vajah se saraswati nadi kaa pani ganga main chalaa gaya, kai vidwaan maanate hai ki isi vajah se ganga ke pani kii mahima hui, bhuuchaal aane ke kaaran jab jameen upar uthi to saraswati kaa pani yamuna main gir gaya
 Therefore, the water of Saraswati also started flowing in the Yamuna
 sirf isiilie prayag main teen nadiyon kaa sangam mana gaya, jabaki yatharth main vahaan teen nadiyon kaa sangam nahin he
 There are only two rivers
 saraswati kabhi bhi elahabaad tak nahin pahaunchi
 The later Vedic literature of the Rigveda mentions the extinction of the Saraswati river, besides the origin of the Saraswati river has been identified as 'plaksha Prasravan', which is situated near Yamunotri
 mahabharat main mili varnan ke anusaar saraswati nadi haryana main yamunanagar se thodaa upar or shivalik pahadiyon se thodaa sa neeche adibadri naamak sthaan se nikalati thi
 Even today people consider this place as a place of pilgrimage and go there
 kintu aaj adibadri naamak sthaan se bahane vaali nadi bahut dur tak nahin jaati ek patali dhara kii tarah jagah-jagah dikhaai dene vaali is nadi ko hi log saraswati kah dete hai
 According to the description of Vedic and Mahabharata period, on the banks of this river was Brahmavarta, Kurukshetra, but today there are reservoirs
 jab nadi sookhti he to jahaan-jahaan pani gaharaa hota he, vahaan-vahaan talab yaa jhilein rah jaati hai or ye talab or jhilein ardhdachandrakaar shakl main paayi jaati hai
 Even today, such crescent-shaped ponds are seen in Brahmasarovar or Pehwa in Kurukshetra, but these too have dried up
 lekin ye sarovar pramaan hai ki us sthaan par kabhi koi vishaal nadi bahati rahi thi or uske sookhne ke baad vahaan vishaal jhilein ban gayin
 According to the Archaeological Council of India, Saraswati originated from a glacier named Rupana in Uttaranchal
 rupan glacier ko ab saraswati glacier bhi kaha jane laga he
 On coming to Naitwar, it used to be converted into glacial water, then Saraswati used to flow to Adibadri in the form of water and go ahead
 vaigyanik or bhugarbheey khojon se pataa chalaa he ki kisi samay is kshetra main bheeshan bhucamp aae, jiske kaaran jameen ke neeche ke pahaad upar uth gaye or saraswati nadi kaa jal peeche kii ore chalaa gaya
 There is also a description of another river Drishdwati in Vedic period
 yah saraswati nadi kii sahaayak nadi thi
 It also flowed through Haryana
 kalantar main jab bheeshan bhucamp aae or haryana tathaa rajasthan kii dharti ke neeche pahaad upar uthe, to nadiyon ke bahaav kii disha badal gai
 The Drishadvati River, a tributary of the Saraswati River, began to flow north and east
 isi drushadwati ko ab yamuna kaha jaataa he, iskaa itihaas 4,000 varsh purv mana jaataa he
 Yamuna was formerly a tributary of Chambal
 bahut baad main yah elahabaad main ganga se jaakar mili
 This was the period when the water of Saraswati also got into the Yamuna
 rugveda kaal main saraswati samudr main girti thi
 As has been said above, Saraswati never reached Prayag

 During the early 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio thought of writing a film based on Pirates of the Caribbean ride
 dijani ne je volport se sawari par aadhaarit ek script likhavai, jo nirmaataa jeri brukhimar ne asweekaar kar di, unhen laga ki yah "ek sateek samudri daaku film he"

 Elliot and Rozio were inspired by the early description of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride and decided to give the film a supernatural edge
 jaise hi bajet upar gaya, maaikel isionar or robert igar ne film ko radd karne kii dhamkee di, haalanki brukhimar ne avadharana kala or anemeshan dikhaa kar unka man badal diya
 In May 2002, Gore Verbinski signed on to direct Seaside Robbers: The Curse of Black Pearl, and the following month Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush signed on to act
 verbinski aadhunik praudyogiki ke upyog ke vichaar se aakarshith hue, jo us style ko punerjeevit karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha jo hollywood ke sunahare yug ke baad gaayab ho gai thi or unhen sawari se judi apni bachapan kii yaadon kaa samaran hua, unhen laga ki yah film iske "daraavne or hasyamay" swar ko shradhanjali dene kaa ek avasar tha
 Depp was attracted to the story because he found it bizarre: Instead of trying to find the treasure, the Black Pearl crew was trying to return it to remove his curse; And the traditional rebellion had already taken place
 verbinski ne rash ko barbosa kii bhoomika ke liye sampark kiya, kyonki vah jaanate the kii vah ise jatilta ke prayaas se nahin balki saral khalnaayaki se nibhaayenge jo kahani ke swar ke anukool hoga

 But The Curse of the Black Pearl was successful both critically and commercially

 Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio knew that with an ensemble actor class they were not free to create completely different positions and actors, as happened with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and therefore The Curse of The Black Pearl had to make the first of the composition triad according to prior activity
 They wanted to find out what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of the first film and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as a plot device
 He decided to introduce Davy Jones, The Flying Dutchman and The Kraken, a devotha which is mentioned only twice in the first film

 agar vyakti bole ke use vakil chahie to poochtacha tab tak band rahani chahie jab tak uskaa vakil bhi vahaan maujuud na ho or vah apane vakil se salaah-mashwara na kar sake
 "the Supreme Court dismissed the sentence pronounced by the Arizona court

 In 1919, a national conference was held in Weimar where a new constitution for the German Reich was written and adopted on 11 August of the same year
 udaar loktantr kaa vah kaal 1930 ke dashak aane tak samaapt ho chukaa tha, jiske falswaroop san 1933 i
 adolf hitler tathaa uski natsi party kaa utthan hua
 The legal gimmicks adopted by the Natsi Party from February to March 1933 are commonly called glykshaltu, which meant that the government could also make laws contrary to the Constitution
 yah ganraajya kaagaj par san 1945 i

 In the event of this political chaos, SDP President Frederick Ebert gained power and ended the First World War by establishing a republic and signing a ceasefire treaty on 11 November 1918
 isi samay german samyavaadee log desh main roosi samyavaadee vyavastha ke anuroop shashan vyavastha sthapit karnaa chaah rahe the kintu ve safal nahin ho sake
 Now the government of Frederick Ebert started working towards the creation of a constitution and on 19 January 1919 announced the election of the National Constituent Assembly in which many political parties participated but no party got a clear majority
 is tarah 421 sadasyeey samvidhan sabha kii pratham baithak 5 farvari 1919 ko ']' naamak sthaan par hui
 The Constituent Assembly made Frederick Ebert the first President of the Republic and Philip Sheedman the Prime Minister

 Using these same crisis rights, Hitler eliminated his opponents
 2

 Therefore, he also considered himself a true representative of the people and considered him more powerful than the Prime Minister

 The constitution of Germany was of the federal system
 atah rajya adhik adhikaron kii maang karte the, isse bhi do kii raajnneetik sthiti par bura asar padaa
 In 1919, instead of the republic that was established in Germany, the people of Germany accepted Hitler's totalitarian power after only 13 years
 isi bindu par yah sawaal uthta he ki aakhir ve koun se kaaran the, jisase navasthapit ganatantr alpakaalik siddh hua
 The factors of the decline of the Republic should be understood in light of the problems facing the Republic - 1
 varsay kii apmanjanak sandhi par hastakshar : ganatantr kii sthapana aise samay main hui thi jab germany sainik paraajay se tut chukaa tha or use baadhya hokar kathor or apmanjanak sharton par hastakshar karnaa padaa tha
 Under this constitution, the territory of alsas-laurent had to be given to France, the army was reduced, a large amount was fixed as compensation for war
 is drushti se ganatantr aarambh se hi logon kii najar main germany ke apmaan kaa pratik tha
 2
 Multiparty system: Germany had multi-party system and no single party ever got majority
 is kaaran vahaan milajula mantrimandal bana jo adhik samay tak sattarudh nahin rah paaya
 Between 1919-1932, 18 governments came into existence, indicative of the chaos inherent in the multi-party system
 aisi sthiti main koi ganatantreey sarkaar german samasyaon ke niraakaran hetu dirghakaalik kaarykram nahin apana saki
 Due to lack of majority support, there was often rule by the ordinances of the crisis Section 48
 atah german janata is ganatantr se ub chuki thi or ganatantr virodhiyon ne iskaa laabh uthaaya
 3
 Economic Crisis: The newly established Republic had to face the economic difficulties of the world war
 vastutah vishwayuddh ke dauraan germany par aarthik boj bad gaya tha
 After the war, its factories were closed, export trade collapsed and there was a tremendous increase in the number of unemployed
 iske saath-saath germany ke upar yuddh kshatipurti kii baari dhanrashi lad di gai thi
 In order to deal with these problems, the government of the Republic increased taxes, took foreign loans, made a lot of circulation of paper currency
 isse german mudra 'mark' kaa avamulyan ho gaya, germany kii aarthik dasha pratikul rup se prabhavit hui
 The economic depression of the 1929 worldwide recession deepened
 in aarthik kathinaayeeyon ko german janata ne wimer ganatantr se jodakar dekha
 As a result, they turned against it and Hitler took advantage of this situation to collapse the republic
 4
 ganatantr kii vaideshik niti : varsay kii sandhi ke pashchaat germany ke prati antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa drushtikon algaavkaari tha
 Various countries viewed Germany with suspicion and mistrust
 itnaa hi nahin, france or belgium kii senaaon ne yuddh kshatipurti vasuuli kii aad main germany ke audyogic kshetra 'rur' par adhikaar kar liya
 In this way, Germany continued to be abolished due to inefficient foreign policy and the Republic was held responsible for this, so when Hitler talked about the expansion of Germany and increasing the prestige in international politics, the German public put it on his eyes
