 The main question is that who had the right to own land - the state, the peasant or any middle class, according to the opinion of the scholars, this right was the right in ancient India, which cannot be called the right of self

 But even in this crisis, the rights of the farmers were not fully surrendered
 bharat main angrejon ke aagamankaal se hi jameendaari pratha kaa udai hone laga
 The British rulers believed that they were the owners of the land and the farmers were their subjects, so they made permanent and temporary arrangements with big farmers and kings and landlords
 yadhyapi raajnneetik auchity se prabhavit hokar usne ek ek pargana har kar vasuul karanevaale ijaaredaar ko paanch varsh ke liye patte par de diya
 Thus, the Zamindari system was recognized by the British, although initially it was not their idea to deprive the peasants of their rights, Lord Corn Wallis became the Governor General in 1786, after Warren Hastigze
 lard cornwalis bhi jameendaari pratha ke paksh main tha

 The zamindari system emerged in Madras through the auction policy of the British rulers
 gaanvon kii bhoomi kaa vibhaajan kar unhen nilaam kar diya jaataa tha or adhiktam mulya denevaale ko vikray kar diya jaataa tha
 Initially, the settlement in Awadh was done by the cultivator but later it was settled with the landlords due to political reasons

 This is the simplest way to collect unjust amount of money and it is also useful from the point of view of politics because as a result, a powerful and rich section of the government will continue to get help

 in bandobaston main krishakon ke hiton kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha jiske parinamswaroop unka du:kha, apmaan evam daridray din pratidin badhata gaya
 Many times the British rulers also pointed out that the land tenure of the farmers should be protected and their rent should be fixed till the time of settlement
 phir bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The reason for this was that the British rulers believed that when they would be prosperous and satisfied in showing leniency in dealing with the zamindars, they would not persecute their assassins, as a result of which they would also be happy
 parantu yah unki mahaan bhul thi kyonki jameendaaron ne hameshaa hi apane kartavya ke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Therefore, the British rulers felt that this mistake should be rectified
 falswaroop unhone krishakon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye bhoomi sambandhi vidhaanon kii vyavastha kii
 This step can be called the first step towards the end of Zamindari system

 But the main purpose of these laws was to facilitate the zamindars in collecting the revenue so that they can give revenue to the state at the right time
 san 1859 i0 main bhoomi sambandhi pehla adhinium paas hua
 This Act was an ideal land-act for all British India, according to which the Act passed in all parts of India and amendments were made from time to time to pacify the disgruntled farmers

 The second phase of the Zamindari system took place from 1930 AD to 1944 AD
 is samay main saare desh main kisaan andolan hone lage
 The seed of these movements was sown by a Kisan Sabha which took place on 11 February 1918 in Allahabad meeting of All India Congress

 As a result, there was a lot of awareness among the rural masses

 Influenced by the peasant movements, new Acts were enacted in the Raiyatwadi areas to protect the interests of the farmers

 Therefore, the Indian National Congress has several times announced that the abolition of Zamindari should give a prominent place in the Congress program
 ek kisaan conference taarikh 27,28 april san 1935 i0 ko sardaar patel ke sabhapatitv main elahabaad main hui thi
 He took a major step towards this by passing the proposal for the abolition of Zamindari, in this proposal it was declared that 'the present Zamindari system is completely opposite from the view of Gramakalyan
 yah pratha british shashan ke aagaman main laai gai or isse gramin jivan purnataya tahas nahas ho gaya he’
 But as World War II started in 1939, the entire program of land reform was halted
 yuddh kii samaapti ke baad jameendaari pratha ke ant kaa antim charan aarambh hua jo san 1945 se 1955 tak chalaa
 At the end of the war, the British government decided to elect provincial houses in 1945 under the Government of India Act 1935
 congress ne chunaav main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or disambar 1945 main chunaav ghoshnaptr nikaala
 In this manifesto, regarding the abolition of Zamindari, it was clearly stated that 'the improvement of the land system, which is most needed in India, is related to the removal of the middle class between the farmers and the state
 isliye is madhyavarti varg ke adhikaron kaa uchit pratikar dekar praapt kar liya janaa chahie’
 Economists, politicians and journalists all agreed with this manifesto
 jameendaari pratha bhartiya aarthik vikaas main rukawat daalati thi kyonki bade jameendaar hameshaa pratikriyavaad ke samarthak the
 The 'london Economist' wrote about them that 'most of these' Thackerseys' characters were as lame as' Lord Stein ', lazy like' Jane Austen '' Mr

 'in the opinion of Indian and Western economists, the abolition of zamindari is necessary for more agricultural production
 iske atirikt yah pratha sansar ke har bhaag main samyaanukool na hone ke kaaran samaapt ho chuki he
 PS, this practice is more expensive for the state
 sarvopari, yah pratha is samay aisi sthiti par pahunch chuki thi ki yadi iskaa unmoolan na kiya gaya hota to iske kaaran ne keval rashtriya aarthik samasya par hi varan samaaj suraksha par bhi vipatti aa padati
 Therefore, as a result of the success of elections in 1946, when the Congress cabinet was formed in every province, a bill was introduced to abolish the Zamindari system according to the election pledge
 ye vidheyak san 1950 i0 se 1955 i0 tak adhinium banakar chaalu ho gaye jinke parinamswaroop jameendaari pratha kaa bharat main unmoolan ho gaya or krishakon evam rajya ke bich pun: sidhaa sambandh sthapit ho gaya
 The landowners now got back to the farmers which they had been using since time immemorial
 is prakaar jis jameendaari pratha kaa udai hamaare desh main angrejon ke aagaman se hua tha uskaa ant bhi unke shashan ke samaapt hote hi ho gaya
 At the end of this practice, no one mourned at all, because the old theory, according to which the owner of the land used to be an agriculturist, recurred as soon as it was destroyed

 Chyavan, the son of Bhrigu Muni, was a great ascetic
 ek baar ve tap karne baithe to tap karte-karte unhen hajaaron varsh vyateet ho gayi
 Even termites and soil got covered in his body and the leaves covered his body
 unheen dinon raja sharyaati apni chaar hajaar raniyon or ekmaatr rupavati putree sukanya ke saath is van main aaye
 Sukanya, walking with her friends, came to Chyavan, doing penance covered with termites and mud and leaves
 usne dekha ki dimak-mitti ke tile main do gol-gol chhidr dikhaai pad rahe hai jo ki vastav main chyavan rishi kii ankhen thim
 Sukanya curiously buried the thorns in those holes
 kaanton ke gadate hi un chhidron se rudhir bahane laga
 Seeing whom Sukanya was frightened, she left quietly
 aankhon main kaante gad jane ke kaaran chyavan rishi andhe ho gayi
 He got very angry when he got blind and immediately cursed Shariati's army to stop stool and urine
 raja sharyaati ne is ghatana se atyant kshubdh hokar poocha ki kya kisi ne chyavan rishi ko kisi prakaar kaa ksht diya he? unke is prakaar poochne par sukanya ne sari baaten apane pita ko bataa di
 King Sharyati immediately approached the Chyavan Rishi and apologized
 chyavan rishi bole ki rajan! tumhaari kanya ne bhayankar aparaadh kiya he
 If you want to be free from my curse, then you have to marry your daughter with me
 is prakaar sukanya kaa vivaah chyavan rishi se ho gaya
 Sukanya was very devoted
 andhe chyavan rishi kii seva karte huye anek varsh vyateet ho gayi
 One day, Ashwanyakumar arrived at the Chyavan Rishi's ashram
 sukanya ne unka yathochit aadar-satkar evam pujan kiya
 Ashwanyakumar said, "kalyani! We are the doctors of the gods
 tumhaari seva se prasann hokar ham tumhaare pati kii aankhon main punah dipti pradaan kar unhen yauvan bhi pradaan kar rahe hai
 Tell your husband to go with us to the lake
 " chyavan rishi ko saath lekar donon ashwanikumaron ne sarovar main dubkee lagaai
 As soon as he took a dip, Chyavan Rishi's eyes were fixed and he became a youth like Ashwani Kumar
 unka rup-rang, akruti aadi bilkul ashwanikumaron jaisaa ho gaya
 He told Sukanya that Devi! You recognize your husband from us and take him to your ashram
 is par sukanya ne apni tej buddhi or pativrat dharm se apane pati ko pahchaan kar unka haath pakad liya
 Ashwani Kumar was very pleased with Sukanya's sharp intellect and pathetic religion and left them both after blessing them
 jab raja sharyaati ko chyavan rishi kii ankhen thik hone naye yauvan praapt karne kaa samachar mila to ve atyant prasann huye or unhone chyavan rishi se milakar unase yajna karaane kii baat kii
 Chyavan Rishi initiated him to the yajna
 us yajna main jab ashwanikumaron ko bhaag diya jane laga tab devraj indra ne aapatti kii ki ashwanikumar devataaon ke chikitsak hai, isaliye unhen yajna kaa bhaag lene kii paatrata nahin he
 But the Chyavan sage ignored the words of Indra and started giving Somaras to the Ashwani Kumaras
 isse krodhit hokar indra ne un par vajra kaa prahaar kiya lekin rishi ne apane tapobal se vajra ko bich main hi rokkar ek bhayanak rakshas utpann kar diya
 He ran to swallow the demon Indra
 indra ne bhaybheet hokar ashwanikumaron ko yajna kaa bhaag dena sweekaar kar liya or chyavan rishi ne us rakshas ko bhasma karke indra ko uske ksht se mukti dilaa di

 In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units or the International System of Units, abbreviated as SI, originally from French: Le Système international d'unités

 The metric system has received worldwide support as a means of means and daily commerce
 iskaa kaaran bahut had tak yah bhi tha ki kai deshon main rudhigat pranaaliyon main kai siddhanton ko samajhane kaa samarthy nahin thi
 At the same time, by standardizing regional changes, a world-wide system, which is universally accepted, was created

 kai deshon ne pramann nikaayon ko praadhikrut karne ke liye pratyaayan nikaayon kaa gathan kiya he, jo ISO 9001 ke anupaalan ke pramann ke liye aavedan karne vaale sanghathanon kaa lekha-pareekshan karte hai
 Although commonly referred to as ISO 9000: 2000 certification, the actual standard by which an organization's quality management can be certified is ISO 9001: 2008
 pratyaayan nikaay or pramann nikaay donon apni-apni sevaaon ke liye shulk lete hai
 The various accreditation bodies enter into mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the accredited certification bodies receive worldwide acceptance
 aavedankaree sanghathan ko iske sthalon, krityon, utpaadon, sevaaon or prakriyaaon ke ek vyapak namoonay ke aadhaar par moolyankit kiya jaataa he; samasyaon kii ek suchi kii jaankaree prabandhan ko di jaati he
 If there is no major problem on this list, or how any problem will be solved, after obtaining a satisfactory improvement plan from the management explaining it, the certifying body has an ISO for each geographical location visited by it
 9001 will issue the certificate
 ek ISO pramaan-patr ek baar or sab ke liye praapt hone vaala puraskaar nahin he, balki ise pramann nikaay ke suzav ke anusaar niyamit antaraalon par, aam taur par teen saal ke aasapaas, avashya navinikrut kiya janaa chahie
 kshamta paripakvata model kii tulana main ISO 9001 ke bheetar kshamta kii koi shrenee nahin hoti he
 4 maanak se panjikrut hone ke liye do prakaar ke lekha-pareekshanon: ek bahari pramann nikaay dwaara lekha-pareekshan or is prakriya ke liye prashikshit aatanrik karmchaariyon dwaara lekha-pareekshan, kii aavashyaktaa he
 Its goal is to have a continuous process of review and evaluation - to verify that the system is operating the way it should, to find out where it can be improved and to identify identified problems Correct or withholding is done
 aatanrik lekha-pareekshakon ke liye ise gunakari mana jaataa he jab ve apane saamaanya prabandhan rekha se baahar lekha-pareekshan karte hai, jisase ki unke nirnay main swatantraaa kii ek degree laai ja sake
 Under the 1994 standard, the audit process could be adequately addressed by performing "compliance audit": 2000 maanak ek alag drushtikon kaa upyog karata he
 Auditors are expected to go beyond mere auditing to memorize "compliance" by highlighting the risks, status and importance
 iskaa matlab yah he ki unase yahi ummid kii jaati he ki aupchaarik rup se kya nirdhaarit he, keval isi kaa paalan karne ke bajaay, kya prabhaavshaalee he, is par adhik gaur karen
 pichley maanak se iske antar ko is prakaar samajhaayaa ja saktaa he: The ISO 19011 standard for auditing also applies to ISO 9001 in addition to other management systems, such as EMS, FSMS, etc
 ISO 9001 maanak samanyikrut or amoort he
 Its parts should be interpreted carefully so that it can be interpreted to be within a particular organization
 Developing software is not the same as preparing cheese or providing consulting services; Nevertheless the ISO 9001 guidelines can be implemented in each of these as they are business management guidelines
 vibhinn sanghathanon—police vibhaag, peshewar footbal team or nagar parishad —ne ISO 9001:2000 kii pranaaliyon ko safaltaapurvak karyanvit kiya he

 yah aanshik rup se yah sunishchit karne ke liye he ki ISO ke sanskarnon kii apni vishisht aavashyaktaaen hai, balki yah bhi koshish or sunishchit karnaa he ki adhik upyukt prashikshit or anbhavi lekha-pareekshakon ko unka moolyankan karne ke liye bheja jaataa he
 The following questions are generally the focus of debate on the effectiveness of ISO 9000: ise vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya gaya he ki uchit gunvattta prabandhan aksar nivesh, share vipanan, bikri vruddhi, bikri margin, pratispardhi laabh or mukademebaaji ke parihaar par ek sakaaratmak prabhaav daalkar vyavsaay main sudhaar laata he
 The quality principles of ISO 9000: 2000 are also very good according to Wade, and Barnes, who states "ISO 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive
 " barns loyad ke register quality esurance ke ek surveykshan kaa bhi uddhrut dete hai jisane sanket diya ki ISO 9000 ne shuddh laabh main badhottaree kii, tathaa vah ek or surveykshan kaa uddhrut prastut karte hai jise deloit-tach ne kiya tha jisane khabar di ki panjikaran kii laagat ko teen saalon main vasula gaya
 Implementation of ISO provides the following benefits, according to Providence Business News: haalanki, 800 spanish companiyon ke ek vyapak sankhyikeey adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki ISO 9000 panjikaran apane aap main hi thodaa-bahut sudhaar laata he kyonki isamen ruchi lene vaali companiyon ne aam taur par pehle se hi gunvattta prabandhan ko kuch is tarah kii patibaddhta kii he or panjikaran se pehle bas aise hi uskaa pradarshan kar rahi thi
 a common criticism of ISO 9001 is the amount, time and paperwork required for registration
 barns ke anusaar, "virodhiyon kaa daawa he ki yah keval pralekhan ke liye he
 Proponents believe that if a company has documented its quality systems, most of the paperwork has already been completed
 " In no way is ISO 9001 an indication that products produced using its certified systems are in any way good
 ek company karaab gunvattta vaale utpaada kaa utpaadan karne kaa iraadaa kar saktaa he or lagaataar evam uchit pralekhan ke saath is par ISO 9001 kaa mohar laga saktaa he
 According to Seddon, ISO 9001 promotes specification, control, and procedures rather than understanding and improvement
 vade kaa tark he ki ISO 9000 ek dishanirdesh ke rup main prabhavi he, lekin ise ek maanak ke rup main badhaava dene par "yah companiyon kii soch ko gumraah karne main madad karata he ki pramann kaa matlab behatar gunvattta he, 


 jisase sanghathan ko apane khud ke gunvattta maanakon ko sthapit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 "as elaborated, Wade argues that relying on the specifications of ISO 9001 does not guarantee a successful quality system
 antarrashtriya str par manyata praapt hone par bhi zyaadaatar america upabhokta ISO 9000 ke bare main jaanate nahin hai or yah unke liye koi mahatv rakhti he
 The additional cost of certifying and then maintaining the certificate cannot be justified if the end-users of the product do not require ISO 9000
 vastav main is laagat se ek company ko ek gaiyr ISO 9000 pramanit company ke khilaaf pratispardhaa karte samay ek pratispardhaatmak nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 This standard is seen as a danger of failure especially when a company is interested in certification before quality
 In fact, certifications are often based on the customer's contractual requirements rather than a desire to improve quality
 "yadi aap keval diwaar par pramaan patr dekhnaa chaahate hai, to ho saktaa he, aap ek aisi kagaji pranali kaa nirmaan karenge jiske liye aapako zyada kuch karne kii jarurat nahin he jis tarah se aap apane vyavsaay ko chalaanaa chaahate ho," ISO ke roger frost ne kaha
 ek swatantra lekha pareekshak dwaara pramann ko aksar ek samasya kshetra ke rup main dekha jaataa he or barns ke anusaar "paraamarsh sevaayen badhaane kaa ek madhyam ban gaya he
 "in fact, ISO itself advises that ISO 9001 can be implemented without certification, only for the benefit of quality
 ek or suchit samasya kai pramann nikaayon ke bich kii pratispardhaa he, jo ek form kii gunvattta pranali ke parichaalan main dekhe gaye dosha ke ek sahaj drushtikon tak le jaataa he

 saanchaa:amphibians The Young Turk movement was a political reform movement that began in the early days of the 20th century
 iskaa uddeshy osmania samrajya ke purna rajtantr ko samaapt karke vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr sthapit karnaa tha
 Later this movement was known as 'ekta and Pragati Samiti'
 1908 main iske netaaon ne sultan abdul hamid dwitiya ke ecchhatra shashan ke viruddh vidroh kaa netritv kiya kiya
 This movement resulted in the second constitutional era in 1908 and for the first time in Turkish history a multi-party democratic system of governance
 beesvin shatabdi main turki ko ‘europe kaa marij’ kaha karte the
 This movement was to provide a new life to Turkey, which resulted in the end of the autocracy of Sultan Abdul Hameed
 is aandolan ko chalaane vaala turkon kaa yuvavarg tha, isliye ise ‘yuva turk’ aandolan kehete hai
 The 'young Turks' movement appeared as a reaction against the autocratic rule of Abdul Hameed
 sarvavidit he ki 1887 i se 1908 i tak ke kaal main turki-samrajya par abdul hamid ne apana nirankush shashan kaayam rakhaa
 However, this autocratic rule of Abdul Hameed also has significance in Turkish history
 atyaachaar, nirankushta or bhrashtachar ke vaataavaran se ek laabh avashya hua
 The reaction against it helped in the creation of the liberal movement in Turkey
 sach to yah he ki abdul hamid ke nirankush shashan ke kaaran turki main rashtriyata kaa prabal veg aayaa or vibhinn prakaar ke sudhaar-kaary sampadit kiye gaye
 From this point of view, it can be said that the main reason for the young Ottoman movement was the autocratic rule of Abdul Hameed
 jis samay abdul hamid ne sansad ko bhang kar apana nirankush shashan sthapit kiya, us samay uskaa sabase prabal aghat turki ke udaar rashtravaadiyon par hua, jo turki main vaidhanik pragati dekhne ke liye varshon se prayaas karte aa rahe the
 Abdul Hameed treated these people very harshly
 saare udaaravaadi pakad liye gaye or unamem se bahuton ko desh se nikaala de diya gaya
 Some people ran away leaving the country on their own
 turki ke nirvasit udaaravaadi bhagkar geneva aae or vahiin se sultan ke khilaaf ek sanghathan khadaa karne lage
 Their aim was to end the monarchy from Turkey and establish a republic
 udaarvaadiyon ne geneva main ek ‘ekta or pragati samiti’ kaa nirmaan kiya or vahiin se sultan ke nirankush shashan kaa ant karne kaa prayaas karne lage
 In this situation, the Turkish patriots exiled abroad began to organize themselves outside the empire
 turki kii unnati or sultan ke nirankush shashan kaa ant karne kaa yahi ekmaatr upaay tha
 The first such organization took place in Istanbul in 1889 AD
 istanmbul ke imperial military college main ibrahim temo naamak ek albanian ke netritv main chaatro ke is dal ne gupt samiti kaa gathan kiya
 The organization was named as 'integration and Progress Committee'
 thode hi dinon main anya sainik vidyalayon ke chaatr iske sadsy ho gaye
 This committee was organized on the basis of the Carbonary Society of Italy, just like it was steeped in national sentiments and its main purpose was to save Turkey from dying
 ekta or pragati samiti se bhaybheet hokar sultan ne samiti ke kai netaaon ko giraftaar kar liya or in netaaon ko turki se nishkasit kar diya gaya
 All such leaders fled from Turkey to Paris or Geneva
 vahaan jaakar ve vikshubdh otomanon se mil gaye
 Among them were people like Ahmad Riza Muradabe etc
 who continued their campaigning through newspapers, magazines, etc
, staying in Paris or other main cities of Europe
 in logon ne geneva main samiti kaa mukhya karyaalay sthapit kiya or murabe ko uskaa sabhapati banaaya
 Turkish nationalist patriots were not discouraged by the work done by the Turkish Sultan
 vahaan se bahut log paris pahunche or 1902 i main otoman samrajya ke udaarvaadiyon kaa ek vishaal sammelan paris main hua
 It included Arabs, Greeks, Jews, Arsenians and Turks
 sammelan main in sabko milakar ek sangh banane kaa nishchay kiya gaya
 It was also passed that the constitution of 1876 AD be re-enacted in the empire
 paris main kranti kii taiyaari hone lagi
 Ahmed Riza was made its leader
 iske liye turk udaarvaadiyon kaa ek sammelan hua or ekta tathaa pragati dal kii sthapana hui
 a revolution was going to take place in Turkey under the leadership of this party
 sultan ke sainik afasar bahut asantusht the
 These people started the revolution
 1906 i main sainikon ne kai vridoh kiye
 But Sultan Abdul Hameed did not pay attention to this
 jansadharan main bhi bhrashtachari afasaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthne lagi thi
 For example, there were many demonstrations in cities
 1908 i main macidonia main kai vidroh hue
 After this, the fire of rebellion started spreading very loudly
 1908 i kii july main sainik afasaron ne yah ghoshnaa kar di ki teesri sena kii tukdi samvidhan ko phir se lagu karaane ke liye istanmbul par hamalaa karegi
 On the same day, the Unity and Progress Committee demanded the implementation of the Constitution
 lekin, abdul hamid ab bhi nishchit hokar baitha rahaa
 The revolutionaries took full advantage of this and the revolution started on 23 July
 selonika main krantikariyon ne ek sarkaar kaa sanghathan kiya or turki ke liye ek samvidhan kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 The Sultan now learned that an extraordinary event had happened in his kingdom
 lekin, tab tak vilamb ho chukaa tha
 There was no hope of getting help from the army
 is sthiti main vah asahaay tha
 At the last time he tried to handle the situation
 24 july, 1908 ko ek sarkari ghoshnaa kii gai, jisamen sultan ne samvidhan ko punah lagu karne kaa vachan diya
 There was also talk of summoning Parliament
 saath hi press par se niyantran hataa liya gaya
 Hence, the Sultan was now completely occupied by the revolutionaries
 yah yuva turk aandolan kii sabase badi safalataa thi
