 sookshm utak vigyaan ke antargat ham jantuon evam paudhon ke utakon kii saamaanya evam rasinic rachana tathaa unke kaary kaa adhyayan karte hai
 The main objective of this study is to find out how different types of tissue are organized in molecular, macromolecular, whole cell and intracellular objects and organs
 jantuon ke sharir ke chaar prakaar ke utak, koshika tathaa antarakoshiki jin vastuon dwaara bani hoti hai, ve kramash: nimnanilakhit hai- The epithelial tissue is composed in the form of a thin membrane, which is present as a coating on the outer surface of various structures and the inner layer in their cavities and tubes
 iske atirikt 'granthi koshika' ke rup main yah grathiyon kii rachana main bhi bhaag letaa he
 It originates from the outer skin or skin and usually its cells are located in a single line
 aisi ekastareey upakalaa ko 'saral upakalaa' kehete hai
 But sometimes its cells are bound in many powers, which is called 'layered epithelium'
 anya utakon kii apeksha upakalaa main koshikaon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 They are connected in a very dense form by intercellular fluid
 upakalaa jhilli dwaara apane neeche kii sanrachanaon evam utakon se sambhddha rahati he
 The epithelium does not have blood vessels, so its nutrient is obtained by lymph
 upakalaa utak mukhyat: teen prakaar ke hote hai- Simple epithelium
 starit upakalaa
 Temporal epithelium
 saral upakalaa ke mukhya prakaar hai-shalki upakalaa, stambhakar upakalaa, granthiy upakalaa, pakshmabhikamay upakalaa, samvedi upakalaa, varnak upakalaa evam bhruneey upakalaa
 The intercellular fluid is more in the connective tissue
 is utak kaa mukhya kaary anya utakon ko sahaara dena tathaa unhen aapas main sanyukt karnaa he
 Cartilage, bone and blood are all similar tissues
 rudhir ko taral sanyoji utak kehete hai

 yellow elastic tissue sharir ke maansal bhaag peshi utak dwaara bane hote hai
 There are many long fibrous-like cells attached to it
 ye koshikaaye sankuchansheel hoti hai, jo tantuon ko failane or sikudne kii kshamta pradaan karti hai
 It has three types - arekhit peshi - ise anaichhik peshi bhi kehete hai, kyonki isaki kriya jantu kii ichha par nirbhar nahin hoti
 This type of muscle tissue is found in the walls of alimentary canal, blood vessels, lungs, gall bladder etc
 inaki koshikaaye saral, lambii, tarkvakar evam arekhit hoti hai
 Most of the muscles of the body are lined
 inaki kriya jantu kii ichhashakti par nirbhar karti he
 Each fiber of the lined muscle is composed of long and cylindrical cells
 inamen shakhaayen nahin hotin tathaa centrakon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 Several transverse strips of dark and light color are placed alternately in the lined muscle
 hritpeshi -hriday ke peshi tantu main rekhit evam arekhit donon prakaar ke tantuon ke gun vartmaan hote hai
 They have transverse strips, but they are branching and have a single center, similar to the nonlinear muscles
 inaki kriya arekhit peshiyon ke samaan hi hoti he
 This type of tissue constitutes the various organs of the nervous system
 samvedansheeltaa ke liye is utak kii rachana main tantrika koshikaaye tathaa tantrika tantu donon hi bhaag lete hai
 Neural cells are often irregularly shaped, and have a large nucleus in the middle
 prayek tantrika koshika se baahar kii ore sookshm prabandh nikalate hai, jo jeevadravya ke bane hote hai
 These tissues are combined in different types to form various organs of the body, giving them integrity

 Micro-histology also studies the microscopic structures that can be viewed with the help of hand lenses, and structures beyond the visible range of electron microscopes
 is kaary ke liye anek prakaar ke yantra prayukt kiye jate hai jaise-eks-re units, 'ebsorpashan microscope', 'electron microscope', 'polarigeshan microscope', 'dark field microscope', 'ultrawilet microscope', vijibul lite microscope, 'phej contrast microscope', 'interference microscope' tathaa 'disacting microscope' aadi
 In ancient times microbiologists made them as thin as possible by cataloging or examining innovative objects by hand-cracking, scrapping, or spreading them, so that they could be viewed from microscopes with visible light
 tatpashchaat 'microtome' kaa avishkaar hua, jisaki sahaayta se patale se patale khand, 1 'mu' kii motaai kii kaate ja sakate hai
 Now even more thin sections than 1 'mu' can be cut
 jis samay 'microtome' kaa prayog prarambh hua, lagbhag usee samay utakon ke 'parirakshan' evam aakaar pratidhaaran ke liye kai prakaar ke sthaayee kar rasayanakon kaa bhi avishkaar hua
 But with the use of these chemicals, which were used to protect, retain or stain the reflected objects, there were many differences in the composition of tissues
 falswaroop pun: abhinav vastuon kaa adhyayan sarvatha niyantrit avasthaa main aarambh hua tathaa utak vigyaan ke antargat kai naveen prayog hue, udaahranarth 'tishyu culture', 'micromenipulation', 'micro cinemetography', antar jivanavashyak abhiranjan tathaa adhijivanashyak abhiranjan

 In this action, the object in a matter which is 150 ° C
 Or cooled to a lower temperature, is added and stored very quickly, then in a vacuum at -30 ° C
 Or less is exploited at the temperature and re-intercalated in paraffin wax
 sookshm utak vigyaan ke adhyayan ke brihat kshetra hai- Morphological description, parivardhan sambandhi adhyayan, Histological and cellular technology, ootkeey evam koshkeey rasayan tathaa Sub-microscope compositions ootkeey evam koshkeey karyiki ke antargat aakaarkiya evam kaaryashiltaa main saamanjasy kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, under histological and cellular chemistry, one obtains knowledge of the chemical composition of morphological compositions

 The hopper balloon is a small, one-man balloon flying with hot air
 paaramparik garm hawa vaale gubaare main jahaan logon ke khadey hone ke liye ek tokari lagi hoti he, vahiin hoper gubaare main aisi koi tokari nahin hoti he
 Instead the hopper pilot usually sits on a chair or wears a parachute
 hoper aamtaur par manoranjan ke liye udaan bharte hai
 These aircraft are sometimes called "cloud hoppers" or "cloudhoppers"
 haalanki ye naam aupchaarik taur par ek khaas nirmaataa ke utpaadon, vishesh kar lindustrand baluns kaa ullekh karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Nevertheless, many people call it "cloudhopper" as a widespread trademark, meaning all such aircraft
 adhik saavdhaneepurvak istemaal main hoper vyapak shabdaawalee he
 Most hopper balloons have covers that range from 14,000 to 35,000 cubic feet and have a maximum flight capacity of one to one and a half hours
 philhal hoper gubbaaraa banane vaale do pramukh vyavsaayik gubbaaraa nirmaataaon ke naam cameron baluns or lindustrand baluns hai
 In addition, most hopper balloons are experimental aircraft designed by amateur manufacturers
 ek khel ke taur par gubaare se chalaang lagane kii shuruyaat sanyukt rajya america main 1924 or england main 1927 ke baad hui
 For many enthusiasts, jumping from a balloon actually means jumping: a person in a balloon actually has to jump from their muscles with the help of a balloon if there is insufficient bounce to fly
 sanyukt rajya america main udaane vaali gas ke rup main helium ko sabase zyada pasand kiya jaataa he kyonki yah aag lagane se surakshit hoti he, isse gubaare main maujuud vyakti ko udate samay dhumrapaan kaa bhi mauka mil jaataa he; anyatra hydroden gas aam thi lekin garm hawa se udne vaale gubaare nahin
 Hopper balloons or leaping balloons are nothing more than a suspension sling with an air bag and a primitive plank, used as a cheap means to test and repair the surfaces of giant airplanes and aircraft planes of stratospheric balloons
 Used as yah upkaran kaaphi suvidhajanak bhi tha kyonki ucch oonchai vaale gubbaaron ko launch karne kii surakshit jagah dur-daraaj main sthit thim jahaan asli hawaondde kii suvidha bhi nahin thim
 An example, when Georgie Prokofiev's ill-fated USSR-3 was launched a second time, the trap entangled atop a giant balloon was unraveled by two hopper balloons: the first jumper fell from the plank but he himself was holding the balloon strings himself Had managed to save
 pehle aadhunik hot air gubaare ko 22 oktober 1960 ko nebraska ke brooning main sanyukt rajya america ke nausena shodh karyaalay ke praayojan ke tahat aid yost ne udaaya tha
 Since the small cover of the Yost's balloon was 31,000 cubic feet and was a chair instead of a basket for the pilot, it is believed that it was the first hopper balloon to fly after the golden age of airplanes of the 1930s
 cloudeoper kaa naam aksar ek vyakti vaale hot air gubaare ke liye liya jaataa he jisamen payalat ek saaj yaa choti kursi par baithta he
 The pilot often has a propane tank and a frame with a burner above the pilot's head
 gubaare kaa burner, tank or payalat kii saaj kaa istemaal gubaare ke aavaran se swatantra rup se kiya ja saktaa he jisase payalat udaan ke dauraan gubaare ko jarurat ke mutabik disha de saktaa he or utar bhi saktaa he
 The term "cloudhopper" was first used by British ballooner Colin Prescott and trademarked
 The development of Cloudhopper was further promoted in 1979 by Per Lindstrand of Colt Balloon
 The Colt Baluns were later merged into the Thunder Baluns and the Thunder and Colt Baluns were established which inherited the name Cloudhopper
 aakhirkaar per lindustrand ne thunder and colt ko chhodkar apni lindustrand baluns kii sthapana kii jo aaj ke cloudeoper kaa utpaadan karti he
 The Cameron Balloons also surfaced with their backpack-style balloons, named Skyhoppers, shortly after Colt's team created and flew their first cloudhopper
 isamen mukhya alag visheshta ye thi ki burner ko niyantrit karne ke liye tivest-grip banaaya gaya tha
 The original Calt Cloudhopper, as well as the modern-age Cloudhopper design, has a burner controller mounted under the burner like a hot air balloon that ferries regular passengers

 Asking the opinion of a subject from a chosen 'sample' of the public and concluding it through statistical analysis is called a 'vote survey'
 saanchaa:social surveys In the sixth century BC, a caste called Lichchhavi lived in the northern part of Bihar state, ie Vaishali Nagar in Muzaffarpur district
 licch naamak mahapurush ke vanshaj hone ke karan inkaa naam lichhavi padaa athwa kisi prakaar ke chihn dhaaran karne ke kaaran ye is naam se prasiddh hue
 The Lichchavi dynasty is well known in history, whose kingdom was once in Nepal, Magadha and Kaushal
 pracheen sanskrit sahitya main kshatriyon kii is shakha kaa naam 'nichhavi' yaa 'nicchhivi' miltaa he
 The Pali form is 'licchavi'
 manusmriti ke anusaar lichhavi log vratya kshatriya the
 In it they are counted along with Jhal, Malla, Nat, Karan, Khash and Dravid
 ye 'lichhavi' log vaidic dharm ke virdohi the
 Many of their branches were spread far and wide
 vaishaliwali shakha main jain tirthankar mahavir swami hue or koshal kii shakya shakha main gautam buddha pradurbhoot hue
 Once upon a time, this dynasty ruled from Mithila to Magadha and Kosala
 jis prakaar hinduon ke sanskrit granthon main yah vansh hin kaha gaya he, usee prakaar baudhon or jainon ke pali or praakrit granthon me yah vansh ucch kaha gaya he
 King Bimbasar of Magadha, contemporary of Gautama Buddha, had relations with the Lichchhavis of Vaishali
 peeche gupt samrat ne bhi lichhavi kanya se vivaah kiya tha
 The history and history of this caste is found in one form or the other for one thousand years
 pali sahitya main lichhavi vajji sangh kii pradhan jati thi atev angutar nikaay, mahavastu tathaa vinayapitak main shodash mahajanapad kii suchi main vajji kaa hi naam aata he, lichhavi kaa nahin
 Probably this is the reason why Panini has mentioned Vrijjya Sangh
 
 Kautilya has also confirmed this
 vajji sangh kii aath jatiyon main lichhavi ko sabal tathaa sarvashaktisampann jati maanate the jisaki rajdhani baishali kaa ullekh ramayana main bhi aata he
 According to Indian tradition, the Lichchhavis were Kshatriya descendants, which is why the Lichchhavi Sangha after Mahaparinirvana divided the relics of the Buddha
 un logon ne us avshesh par stupa kaa nirmaan kiya tha jo vaishali kii khudaai se prakaash main aayaa he
 Being a region of Buddhism and Jainism, special mention has been made of the Lichchavi caste in Palisakhtya
 ise apaar shaktishaalee tathaa uttam dhang se sangathit sangh kaha gaya he
 The second association of Buddhism also took place in Vaishali
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki lichhavi logon ne bimbsaar ke shasankaal main magadh par chadhaai kii thi 
 The treaty in Magadha and Vaishali states resulted in a matrimonial relationship, but after Bimbasar, Ajatashatru thought to avenge this war
 sansar se virakt rahane par bhi buddha ne ajatshatru ko sachet kiya tha ki lichhavi sangh ajey he, abhedya he tathaa uske prajatantratmak sanghathan ko koi nirbal nahin kar saktaa
 Aware of these words of the Buddha, Ajatashatru gave up the idea of making a direct attack and entrusted the vile task of breaking the Lichchhavi Sangh and making it distinct by creating distinction
 ant main ajaat safal hua
