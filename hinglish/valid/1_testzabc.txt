 apane vittiya salaahkaar schabir shaike par bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi kaa aarope lagane par zuma bhi bhrashtachar se sambandhit vivaad main ulajh gaye
 Bulleani Ngcuka, who was then National Director of Public Prosecutions, was investigating allegations of misuse of power against Zuma and ANC Chief Whip Tony Yengeni

 On 2 June 2005, Shaik was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years
 nyaayadhish hillari squirs shaike or zuma ke bich hue kai lenden kii vistrut jaankaree, is saransh ke saath dete hai ki "sabhi aaropee companiyon kaa istemaal ek naa ek samay jacob zuma ko paise dene ke liye kiya gaya he"
 media ne squirs ke bayaan kaa galat uddhran "ek aam taur par bhrasht sambandh" vaakyansh ke saath diya, jabaki thik yahi sateek shabd adalati pratilekhon main maujuud nahin he
 In defense of the beginner of this phrase, Zuma is actually mentioned 471 times in the entire transcript of the judgment against Shack, the word "corrupt" or "corruption" has been used 54 times and contains 12 sentences containing Both the words "corrupt" and "zuma" are used together
 baad main media sutron ne is vaakyansh ko "parsparik laabhprad sahjivita", main badal diyajo faisle ke anuchhed 235 se badla gaya tha, jo tha: "yah sochna saamaanya bodh or saadhaaran maanav prakruti ke khilaaf hoga ki unhen zuma kaa varadahast praapt hone ke phaaydon kaa ehsaas nahin tha, jo 1997 se pehle kii tulana main kahin adhik mil rahaa tha; or yahaan tak ki agar unke bich kabhi aisa kuch nahin kaha gaya jo parsparik laabhprad sahjivita ko sthapit karata he, jo sakshya ke anusaar vahaan maujuud tha, iske prarambh hone kii paristhitiyaan or in bhugtanon ko baad main jari rakhane kaa silsilaa, praptakarta ke andar keval kritagyata kii ek bhaavana hi utpann kar saktaa he
 " media dwaara unke bhavishya ke bare main gahari atakalein lagaae jane ke baarah dinon ke baad, raashtrapati thabo mabek ne 14 june 2005 ko zuma ko up raashtrapati ke pad se hataa diya
 Mbeki said in a joint sitting of Parliament that "it would be best in the interest of the Honorable Vice President, Government, our youth democratic system and our country to relieve the Honorable Jacob Zuma from the responsibilities of the post of Vice President of his Republic and member of the Cabinet
 Be done
 " Zuma then resigned as Member of Parliament
 shaike mukademe ke baad, zuma par rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran dwaara aupchaarik rup se bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 The case was withdrawn from the Pietermaritzburg High Court after the prosecution's application for adjournment was dismissed
 zuma ke kanoonee dal ne karrwai main deree ko jari rakhaa or zuma ke is daawey ke baavjood ki is maamle ko adaalat main dekhne kii unki ichha he, ve adaalat se kuch mahatvapurn saboot chupaane main kaamyaab ho gaye jiske parinamswaroop abhiyojan paksh ko nirdhaarit tithi par sthagan ke liye ek aavedan patr daayar karnaa padaa
 On 8 November 2007, the Supreme Court of Appeal pronounced its judgment in favor of the National Prosecuting Authority in connection with various search and seizure operations carried out by Zuma's defense team and four appeals dismissed by them
 yah nirnay rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran dwaara ek francisi hathiyaar company ke varisht sadsy kii vyaktigat diary praapt karne ke sambandh main tha, jisamen ek hathiyaar saude ko pradaan karne ke dauraan sambhavtah zuma ke bhrasht kaaryakalapon se sambandhit jaankaree pradaan kii gai thi
 On December 28, 2007, Scorpion prosecuted Zuma in various cases in the High Court on fraud, money laundering, corruption and fraud
 ek doshasiddhi or 1 varsh se adhik avadhi ke karawas ne zuma ko dakshin africa sansad ke chunaav ke liye ayogy bana diya hota or falswaroop ve dakshin africa ke raashtrapati pad ke liye ayogy ho jate
 On 4 August 2008, Zuma appeared in court
 On 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg Judge Chris Nicholson stated that the corruption charges against Zuma were illegal on procedural grounds because the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions did not give Zuma the opportunity to submit a representation before deciding to press charges and pay the state legal
 Instructed to do
 nikholson ne yah bhi kaha ki, unka maananaa tha ki raajnneetik hastkshep ne zuma ke khilaaf punah aarope daayar karne ke nirnay main ek bhoomika nibhaai, yadhyapi unhone yah nahin bataaya ki kyon unhone zuma par lage aaropon ko avaidh bataaya
 Nikholson also emphasized that his decision was not related to Zuma's guilt or guilt, but was only on a procedural basis
 vibhinn media reporton ne yah galat soochna di ki zuma ke khilaaf aarope khaarij kar die gaye hai
 This was not the case
 NDPP, zuma par punah aarope lagane main sakasham bana hua tha, haalanki, sirf ek hi baar unhen NDPP ke samaksh abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka diya gaya wo bhi NDPP ke aisa karne ke nirnay ke aadhaar par
 nirnay ke 47 paragraph main, nyaayadhish nikholson ne likhaa, The compulsion to listen to representations is a part of the principle of audi alteram partem
 aavashyaktaa yah he ki ek vyakti jo ho saktaa he ki ek nirnay ke kaaran pratikul rup se prabhavit ho rahaa he, use ek anukool parinaam praapt karne kii drushti se ek abhyavedan prastut karne kaa avasar diya janaa chahie
 prabhavit vyakti ko aamtaur par us maamle ke saar yaa tatwon ke vishay main suchit kiya janaa chahie, jis par use jawaab dena he
 The court determined that the ndpp's failure to follow the procedure outlined in section 179 of the constitution invalidated the ndpp's decision to re-charge Zuma
 nyaayadhish nikholson ne paaya ki zuma par lagaae gaye aaropon ke samay par vibhinn anumaan lagaae ja sakate hai jo is nishkarsh kii pushti karata he ki isamen sarkaar kii kaaryakari shakha dwaara raajnneetik hastkshep kaa kuch ansh shaamil he
 Judge Nicholson writes in paragraph 210 of his decision, raashtrapati kii polokavane main hui raajnneetik haar ke baad, 28 disambar 2007 ko shriman emse dwaara chalaae gaye abhiyog kaa samay, sabase adhik durbhagyapurna tha
 This aspect, combined with the incident of Mr
 Piccoli who should have been independent and immune to the suspension of executive intervention, convinced me that the most true conclusion is that the damaging political influence continues
 nirnay ke anuchhed 220 main nyaayadhish nikholson ne aage likhaa he, There is a worrying structure in the behaviors i have set out above signs of political interference, pressure or influence
 yah mantri maduna dwaara shri ngakuka ko die gaye "raajnneetik netritv" se shuru hua, jab unhone aavedak par mukadmaa chalaane se inkaar kar diya, jiskaa aparaadh tha unka thint pratinidhiyon se vaarta karnaa or milanaa or anya maamle jiskaa ullekh main kar chukaa hum
 sakshya ke niyam die jane ke kaaran adaalat is nishkarsh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya he jo us paksh ke hit ke liye sabase kam anukool he jinke paas tathyon kaa vishesh gyaan he
 This is certainly more prevalent than the political interference of "clues or suggestions" mentioned in the Yengeni case
 yah ek gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he ki is tarah kii prakriya, nae dakshin africa main ghatit hui or isane rangabhed shashan ke antargat vinaash ko prerit kiya
 " sunwaayee se pehle zuma ke samarthakon kii ore se dakshin africa nyaaypalika kii khub aalochana kii gai
 In this context, the irony was that the South African judiciary was found in favor of Zuma for the third time, including acquittal of the rape charges leveled against him
 NDPP ne jald hi is nirnay ke khilaaf apil karne ke apane iraade kii ghoshnaa kii
 Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit in the Constitutional Court to appeal the decision of Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson: mujhase sambandhit aise doorgaami "afasosjanak, pariwadaatmak or pratikul" nishkarsh nikalnaa or zuma maamle ke un nishkarshon ke aadhaar par faisla karnaa or ninda karnaa adaalat ke liye anuchit tha
 My absolute request is that the defense of the interests of justice is in improving the matter
 in pratikul nishkarshon ne mere ANC party dwaara meraa naam waapas liye jane ko falit kiya - yah ek aisa nivedan tha jise maine pichley 52 varshon se ANC kaa ek patibaddh or vafaadaar sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 i am afraid that if not rectified, i may face further adverse effects
 rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke pravaktaa, talaali talaali, ne 23 sitambar ko pretoria se phone dwaara kaha, "hame kagajaat mil gaya he
 It is under consideration
 " On 12 January 2009, Blomfontein's Supreme Court of Appeal rejected the decision for this appeal
 up nyaayadhish adhyaksh lui harms ko apil ke do pahaluon par nirnay lenaa padaa
 pehla pahalu tha ki kya zuma ko is baat kaa adhikaar tha ki ve NPA ke samaksh abhyavedan karne ke liye aamantrit kiye jaayen wo bhi unke khilaaf rishwat or bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko waapas liye jane kaa nirnay liye jane se pehle
 doosraa pahalu yah tha ki kya nyaayadhish nikholson zuma par ilzaam lagaae jane ke NPA ke nirnay ke sandarbh main tatkaaleen raashtrapati thabo mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ko samajhane main sahi the
 On the question of inviting representations during the review of the npa's decision, Harms DP found that the interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution given by Nicholson was incorrect because the NPA had no such obligation and was therefore free to accuse Zuma, He has done
 nikholson ke mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ke vishay main die gaye tark ke sawaal par, harms deepi ne paaya ki "nichali adaalat ne apane adhikaron kaa ulanghan kiya he"
 On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority, in light of the new revelation of serious flaws in the prosecution, withdrew all charges against Zuma and co-accused French arms company Thint
 yah rahasyodghatan phone vaarta ke tukdon ke rup main the jo yah dikhaate the ki scorpian ke adhyaksh, lionard maikaarthi or saarvajanik abhiyojan ke purv rashtriya nideshak, bulilani ngakuka ne zuma par abhiyog chalaae jane ke samay ko lekar saazish rachi thi, jo sambhavyatah zuma ke raajnneetik pratidwandvi, raashtrapati thabo mabek ke raajnneetik laabh ke liye tha
 The withdrawal of the charge was announced by the acting president of the NPA, Mokothedi Empshe, who insisted that the withdrawal of the charges was due to abuses that made the legal process "tainted" and not equal to acquittal
 NPA kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad, haalanki, kam se kam do raajnneetik dalon ne suchit kiya ki aaropon ko waapas liye jane kii sthiti main ve apane se kanoonee karrwai par vichaar karenge
 The Democratic Alliance later filed an appeal for a judicial review of the npa's decision, with reference to his party leader Helen Zilla clarifying that Ampshey "did not make decisions based on the law, but was bound by political pressure" 
 On 9 June 2009, the day of hearing of the case was fixed
 jabaki zuma ne apni pratikriya ko kalochit rup se daayar kiya, ampshe ne maamle kii sunwaayee main deree kii, jisamen unhone NPA kii pratikriya ko pesh karne ke liye do vistaaran kaa anurodh kiya
 NPA spokesman Muthunzi Mahaga said they would not file papers because there are "outstanding cases" that are yet to be resolved
 democratic elliance party pramukh jile ne tark diya ki zuma kii pratikriya moulik rup se galat he or "unamem koi sanvaidhanik aadhaar nahin hai"
 jabaki kanoonee chunautiyaan jari rahi, june 2009 ko hue ek surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki, aadhe se zyada dakshin africa yah maanate hai ki raashtrapati jacob zuma acha kaam kar rahe hai
 The poll conducted by TNS Research Studies in late June 2009 showed that Zuma's approval level had steadily improved
 surveykshan main shaamil logon main se lagbhag 57% ne kaha ki ve sochate hai ki zuma ek sakasham netaa hai - yah taadaad april 2009 main raashtrapati ke naam udghaatan ke mukaable 3% tak adhik thi
 In November 2008, just a few months after former President Thabo Mbeki was withdrawn and Zuma faced corruption charges, only 36% of South Africans were positive about him
 disambar 2005 main, zuma par apane forest toun, johanesburg vaale ghar main ek 31 varshiya mahila kaa balaatkaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 The alleged victim belonged to an important ANC family, was the daughter of a close associate of Zuma's struggle days and was an AIDS activist believed to be HIV positive
 zuma ne in aaropon kaa khandan kiya or daawa kiya ki yah yon sambandh aapasi sahmati se bana tha
 Even before the charges were filed, as rumors about rape allegations erupted in November, Zuma's political prospects seemed to be on the decline
 unke ucch str ke adhikansh raajnneetik samarthakon ne in nae aaropon ke sandarbh main us tarah se pratikriya nahin di jis tarah se unhone bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke khilaaf di thi
 In a hearing before the rape trial, crowds of thousands of his supporters gathered before the court, while small anti-rape groups demonstrated for the alleged rape victim
 jaise kii zuma ne mukademe ke dauraan kiya, ve bheed ke saath lethu masini vami gaate rahe or ANC yuva lig or balm panthi party yuva lig ke pravaktaa ne zuma ke samarthan main baat kii
 As the rape trial progressed, reports surfaced that the South African left wing contingent differed on how to address Zuma's case and the sacp's relationship with him
 Many members of the party's youth wing supported Zuma while other members of the SACP were skeptical about the value of performing for a particular person against important principles of governance
 kuch purv samarthakon ke dalbadal lene ke baavjood, kai zuma samarthakon ne adaalat ke baahar pradarshan karnaa jari rakhaa, abhiyokta kii akhandta or naitikta par nirantar pratighaat karne, abhiyokta ke ek kareebi dost par apshabd oochhaalane or abhiyokta samaj kar kisi anya mahila par pathar phenkane jaise krityon ne balaatkaar virdohi samoohon kii aalochana ko badhaava diya
 Zuma's defense team presented evidence relating to the victim's sexual past and insisted that the physical relationship was with both consent
 abhiyojan paksh ne is baat par jor diya ki us mahila kaa pratirodh naa karnaa uske sadame kii sthiti main hone ke kaaran tha or un donon ke bich kaa sambandh pita putree ke sambandh jaisaa tha
 The lawsuit also sparked a political controversy when Zuma, who at the time was heading the National AIDS Council, admitted that he had unprotected sexual intercourse with a woman accused of rape, knowing that Also that she was HIV positive
 unhone adaalat main yah kaha ki "HIV sankraman ke khatre ko kam karne ke liye" uske turant baad unhone snaan kar liya
 The statement was condemned by the judge, health experts and AIDS activists
 dakshin africa kii lokapriy comic strip, madam or eve or jane maane raajnneetik cartoonist zapiro ne is maamle kaa mazaaq udaaya
 HIV kii shiksha dene waalon ne jor diya ki yah HIV sankraman ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar paayegaa
 On 8 May 2006, the court found Zuma innocent and Zuma agreed that the sexual act surrounded by the questions was consensual
 nyaayadhish vine dar marave ne abhiyokta ko adaalat main jhooth bolne ke liye buree tarah se fatkaaraa, lekin zuma ko bhi apni laaparvaahee ke liye doshi tehraaya
 When his rape case ended, many South Africans wondered how to fill the gaps created by Zuma's trial in his political system
 An analysis by Mel & Guardian described these incidents as particularly disturbing: phir bhi, balaatkaar mukademe ke khatm ho jane ke baad, bijness de kii krima brown ne di gargian ko bataaya "jacob zuma waapas aa gaye hai
 This poses a serious dilemma for the ANC leadership
 ab zuma waapas luthuli house kii ore agrasar hai
 ] They will demand to be reinstated back to the post of vice president and others will find it difficult to block their way 


 This is a major victory for Zuma's political career
 " The prospect of Zuma's return as a contender for the presidency became a cause for concern for international investors
 ek swatantra vishleshak ne suzav diya, "haalia surveykshanon ke anusaar, zuma or unke mashin gan chalaanevaale kafile ko union building kii ore badate hue dekhnaa mukhyatah madhyam varg or vyapaariyon ko hatotsahit karne vaala he
 " upaadhyaksh ke rup main kaary karte hue zuma ne ANC ke vam paksh kaa samarthan hasil kiya, jinamein ANC yuva lig, dakshin africa communist partyor dakshin africa trade union congress ke kai sadsy shaamil the
 The support of these organizations remained even when Zuma was facing allegations of corruption
 party ke bheetar ardh swytt sanrachanaon ne zuma ke samarthan ko tab bhi banaae rakhane main sahaayta kii jab ve desh ke up raashtrapati pad se hataa die gaye
 Zuma's dismissal was interpreted in two ways
 kai antarrashtriya paryvekshakon ne iskaa swaagat ek spasht sanket ke rup main kiya ki dakshin africa sarkaar apane bhitari rankon se bhrashtachar ko ukhaad fankne ke liye samarpit he
 On the other hand, some people in South Africa highlighted the fact that Zuma and Mbeki represent two different constituencies in the African National Congress
 kuch vampanthi samarthakon ne daawa kiya ki mabek or unka bazaar-unmukhi paksh ANC main apana varchasv kaayam rakhane ke uddheshy se zuma ko baahar nikalne kii sajeesh kar rahaa hai
 In 2005, each of Zuma's court appearances related to corruption was crowded by a large number of his supporters
 adaalat kii ek taarikh main, zuma ke samarthakon ne mabek ke chitra vaale tii shart jalaae, is ghatana ne ANC kii ninda arjeet kii; zuma or unke sahyogiyon ne baad ke ekatrikarnon ke liye party ke anushaasan ke daayre main rahane kaa aagrah kiya
 On the next court date in November, thousands of Zuma supporters gathered to support him; Zuma addressed the Durban crowd in the Zulu language and appealed to them to maintain the unity of the party and sang the song Lethu Machines Vami of the apartheid struggle, which literally translates to the words "meri machine me la" It is understood in the context of machine guns
 oktober main ANC yuva lig ke liye ek daure main desh main kisi anya jagah zuma ne ek badi bheed kii vaahvahee jiti
 While at least a partial of his political power is based on inter-party relations, one analyst argued that the loyalty of his supporters was rooted in the Zulu approach to loyalty and mutual aid
 party tatwon ke bich unke samarthan kii vajah se, zuma ek shaktishaalee raajnneetik vyaktitv bane rahe, jiske kaaran desh ke up raashtrapati ke pad se apni barkhaastagi ke baad bhi ve ANC main ek ucch pad par bane rahe
 In November 2005, a panel of assembled analysts agreed that it would be difficult for any other possible ANC candidate to defeat Zuma in the country's presidential race in 2009, if Zuma is found innocent on corruption charges
 Will happen
 haalanki, in vishleshkon kaa yah bhi sawaal tha ki kya zuma vastav main ek vampanthi ummidavaar hai jaisaa ki unke kai samarthak samajhate hai or yah bataaya ki jo vaishvik or rashtriya aarthik baadhaaen mabek ke shashan kaal main vyaapt thi ve agle raashtrapati pad ke kaarykaal main bhi nahin badalengi

 Rechargeable batteries are of different sizes - from button cells to megawatt power systems
 cell ko charge karte samay uskaa dhanatmak sakriy padaarth oxykrut hokar electron detaa he
 At the same time, the negative active substance of the cell is reduced and accepts the electrons
 ye hi electron vahya paripath main dhara pravaah karaate hai
 Electrolytes can act as a simple medium through which ions can easily move from one electrode to another electrode; Or can also take an active part in the electrochemical activity occurring inside the electrolytic cell
 sanchayak bydaree ek yukti he jisamen rasinic urja sanchit kii jaati he, jo kisi bhi samay vidyut ke rup main nirmukt ho sakati he
 There are two types of storage batteries in common use: lead-acid bydaree kaa avishkaar 1859 main french bhautikashastri gaston plante ne kiya tha
 It is the oldest rechargeable battery

 Apart from these properties, its cheapness makes it attractive to be used in motorcycles, because the starter motor requires a lot of electric current when starting vehicles
 yah bydaree ek yaa anek sarvasam ikaayiyon kii bani hoti he, jinhen cell kehete hai
 The potential of each cell is two volts
 6 volt kii saadhaaran automobile bydaree main teen cell shreneeyojit hote hai
 Each cell contains acid electrolytes, usually sulfuric acid, and electrodes of sis in two or more chemical forms
 electrode praaia: dhan yaa rin pattica kehalaate hai
 These plates are equipped with a movable frame and electrical conductor, which is called a grid
 grid, dhatvik lead yaa mishradhatu tathaa sakriy lead kaa bana hota he
 The active grid fills the lead recess and performs the necessary electrical chemical work
 grid lead, antimony, tin, bismuth, arsenic tathaa anya tatwon ke alp bhinnaatmak pratishat vaali mishradhatu se dhalkar banaaya jaataa he
 The active substance in Dhana Patikka is lead peroxide
 rin pattica ke sakriy padaarth ye hai : sarrandhra, sookshm vibhajit, swat:baddh dhatvik shuddh lead tathaa alpayojya padaarth, jiskaa kaary sanrandhrata ko banaae rakhana he
 During the lifetime of the battery, the minus plate is repeatedly charged and immersed, thus the additives are required to maintain the stability of the debt plate
 prayavarti dhan tathaa rin patticoon ke madhya main pruthakkaarak lagaakar, in donon patticoon ko pruthak kar samyojit karte hai
 The separator prevents money and loan bars from touching each other
 pruthakkaarak ko amlapratirodhi tathaa vidyut apghaty evam vidyutdhara ke liye saralata se pargamya hona chahie
 This permeability should be fine-grained so that particles of active substances do not enter during the operation of the battery from the money plates
 pruthakkaarak kaa rin pattica ke baad kaa bhaag samtal hota he or dhan pattica ke vipareet ore kaa bhaag khaanchedaar yaa dharidaar hota he
 Generally wood is used more as a separator
 pruthakkaarak ke liye prayukt honevaali lakdi kaa adhikansh regin tathaa amla rasinic kriya dwaara nikaal liya jaataa he
 Some varieties of cedar have proved to be excellent for wood separators: synthetic seperators of fine-grained rubber are also being used extensively
 jalwaayu yaa parivartansheel aavesh dar sambandhi ucch taap kaa saamana karne ke liye kritrim pruthakkaarak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The separator is introduced by a supporting sheet of a porous material, such as glass filaments or perforated rubber
 yah prachlan dhan pattica ke parshv ke vipareet rakhaa jaataa he
 When the battery is overworked, this reinforcement is helpful in the control of the lid of the active material during its lifetime
 lead amla bydaree main vidyut apghaty praaia: tanu salphurik amla, jo bydaree ke aavesh kii avasthaa ke saath saath parivartit hota he, rahata he
 When the battery is charged, the dilution of sulfuric acid is high and the acid concentrates as the battery is immersed
 jab batariyaan purnat: aaweshit rahati hai, tab adhikansh badariyon ke vidyut apghaty kaa aapekshik dhanatv lagbhag 1
280 rahata he, lekin ushn jalwaayu main yah ghanatv 1
125 or thandhi jalwaayu main 1
300 rahata he
 Generally, the relative density of 1
15 relative to electrolyte indicates that the battery is 90 percent immersed
 jab sanchayak aaweshit rahata he, us samay lead, rin pattica or lead oxide,, dhan pattica kaa kaary karata he
 Both these plaques are immersed in the electrolytes of sulfuric acid
 visarjan ke samay sakriy padaarth tathaa vidyut apghaty main rasinic parivartan hota he
 The lead of the minus plaque is deprived of two electrons, while the lead oxide of the fillet plaque yields two electrons
 rin pattica par nimnlikhit abhikriya hoti he : The following synchronous reaction occurs on the money strip: lead monooxide salphurik amla ke saath kriya kar nimnlikhit fal detaa he : In the immersion period, both money and debt plates are covered with lead sulfate
 is samay vidyut apghaty, arthath salphurik amla, kaa aapekshik ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, kyonki kuch salphurik amla pani main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The battery is charged with the current flowing opposite to the direction in which the current is moving while the battery is in action, due to which the battery recovers its original condition, that is, lead sulphate of the fillet is in the precursor of the lead oxide
 goes
 is prakaar rin pattica par hydrogen aayan do electron mukt karata he
 Its reaction is as follows: dhan pattica par sulphate aayan do alectron mukt karata he, jisaki abhikriya nimnlikhit he : Since plumbic sulfate is not stable in water, the final reaction is as follows: aavesh kii abhikriya se vidyut apghaty kaa aapekshik ghanatv bad jaataa he
 The cycle of charge and immersion lasts until the physical structure of the battery is destroyed due to electrical decomposition or oxidation of the separator
 bydaree kii dakshata taap ke parivartan se prabhavit hoti he
 Low heat causes low efficiency
 bydaree ke aaweshit or visarjeet hone kii dar par bhi bydaree kii dakshata nirbhar karti he
 When the battery is charged slowly and immersed slowly, the battery efficiency is high

 The film begins with a film pulled from an old Super 8 camcoder where four people are standing in a loop, the other end of the loop is tied to the second branch, the same piece is cut mysteriously by the weight of those four people
 The snares are pulled up tightly
 kai maah baad usee ghar par krim rieter ellison oswalt apni nai kitaab likhane ke liye apane parivaar saath shift hota he, uske saath uski wif traisi or do bachche, 7 saal kii eshli jise deevaaron par art-painting karne kaa shauk he or 12 saal kaa trevor 
 haalaanki vahaan kaa local sheriff use yahaan se shift na hone kii hidaayat detaa he, ellison ko pataa he is ghar main ek katl kii vaardaat hui he or is maamle par padtaal ke baad wo yahaan se chale jaaenge
 During the investigation of the house, Allison finds a box from the roof attic room, but while removing the box, there is a big scorpion which he kills
 ellison apni kitaab is katl e vaardaat par isliye bhi likhnaa chahta he kyonki us katl ke baad parivaar kii aakhri 10 saal kii ladki steffni rahasyamay dhang segumshuda he
 Here, a home projector from the box found in the house and the reel case of the 8mm standard film Negative, Allison was beginning to see all the minor domestic home-movies, finally she is witness to the dreadful end of the family
 jaise pool main bandhi haalat main parivaar kii dubkar maut, puure parivaar kii band car main lagi aag se jinda jalanaa, barsaat kii raat main laan removal se ghaas kaatane kii jagah jinda log ko kaatna, der raat puure parivaar ko gahari neend main khanjar se jibah karnaa or aakhri film jahaan ek darkht par chaar logon ko faansee par latakaaya gaya he
 Alison is heartbroken to see this ruthless murder, here she then finds another mysterious person in the pool party movie and also a strange mark, and this is seen in every previous film as well
 He takes out photo printouts of all these one by one
 isi darmyaan lit cat jaati he or kuch aahat sunai padati he jo chat kii atic rum se aa rahi hoti he, apane diji cam kii flash kii madad se jab ellison vahaan pahunchataa he to vahaan use projector baks kaa dhakkan sarakate hue paata he, chad se hataane par usase ek karait saanp rengta hua nikal jaataa he
 Looking at the lid here, he gets an exact sketch of the same slaughtered family, Allison takes pictures of all of them, as well as a sketch of the same man
 Shown by the name of Bugiman
 ellison philhal atic rum se nikalne hi vaala tha ki vahaan kaa farsh tut jaataa he, kisi tarah latakane ke baavjood vah buree tarah girtaa he or pairon par chot aati he
 The next morning, with medical attention, the police also arrive there to find Tafriah, showing local deputy Swinsky interested in investigating the murder by Allison, in return for which Allison asks for a bio-data of all the dead families and the case files related to them
 cese kii study se yahi maaloom hota he ki sabhi parivaar alag-alag tarikhon or shahar main hui, samanta sirf harek parivaar kii maut ke baad ek bachche kaa rahasyamay dhang se gaayab hona
 maut se pehle parivaar ke sadsy ko kisi kism kaa nasha karana taaki katl ke samay ve sangharsh na kar paaen
 And the presence of a mysterious person in every film and the finding of a demonic mark
 The deputy then also advises Ellison to talk to Professor Jonas of the local university, who often helps the police in such mysterious and intriguing cases, to understand the issue
 shaam ko ellison laan work '86 kii film dekhne par katl vaale drishy dekh dahal jate he, khud ko shant karne baad online chat par professor jonas se yah malumat hote jis mi
 bugiman or film main darshaae nishaan madhyakaalin yug ke bughuul se sambandhit he jo vibhinn tareekon se parivaar kii hatya karata he or ek bachche ko vaastavik duniya se apni mayavi duniya main apana gulam banane ko le jaataa he
 Although according to the professor this is just a story, Alison also considers it a coincidence
 phir apni offis band karke ellison sone chal detaa subah 3 baje aas-paas projector chalane kii aawaaj sun chaunk padataa he, lekin offis pahunchne par vahaan koi dikhataa nahi, anjaane dar se vah besabaal kalb lekar kamaron kaa muyayana karata he, or usee ke peeth peeche unheen gumshuda bacchon ke saae najaron main aae bagaiyr luccatipi karte he
 He also goes to Ashlee's room, where he closes the door with a look, but Ashley's eyes were on Stephanie, who was sitting in front of the wall with the same picture, which had people hanging on the family's court, including Bughoul
 thakaa hua ellison sofe par hi besabaal-club pakade baithe-baithe so jaataa he, agali soobah hone tak wo jaagta he
 Upon waking up, Alison then goes to the office cabin, where the film and projector are lying as she is, and later narrates the night's experiences to Deputy Siewinski, the deputy advising her to avoid dominating her life
 udhar traisi se ellison ko eshli kii shikaayat aati he ki wo room ke baahar tasviir bana rahi he, lekin eshli ke mutabik yah sab usee steffni ne banaaya he jis ellison apni kitaab likh rahaa he
 Later, Tracy's patience is broken, according to which the house where Alison is writing the book of murder, now her own family is in danger
 yahaan ellison bhi apana tark detaa he ki wo usne sirf apane parivaar ke khatir is sachai chhupaai thi, use iske asar kaa jaraa sa bhaan na tha, or bina apni kitaab puri kiye wo yahaan se ja nahin ja saktaa
 is bahes or tark main lagbhag donon tut jate he
 The two reconcile in the late evening to realize their mistake, and Alison wakes up in the same night, Alison wakes up to the sound of the projector, chasing the sound he finds in the office, on the way to the attic room, to the terrace
 The staircase was open, upon seeing it, Alison was surprised to see the film going on the projector sitting on the same five children missing, all the children looking at it and looking silent Rae, the creepy Bughuul appearing in the film, suddenly appears in front of her face when Alison falls down the stairs screaming in fear, the projector from the ceiling and the movie Mee is hit on the floor
 ellison un sabhi chizon ko bakeyard main jala daalata he, phir traisi or donon bacchon ko saath lekar apane pichley ghar lautne kaa faisla letaa he
 While patrolling along the way, Sheriff stops following Alison and sees him driving fast, Allison says that he is returning to his old home and is currently not writing a book, then the sergeant gives Alison further instructions
 Lets grow
 agali subah tak ellison apane puraane ghar par sara saamaan shift kara letaa he, shaam ko ellison laptaap par professor kii mail kiye gaye bughuul se sambandhit tasviren dekhtaa he, jinhen dekh pichhali ghatnaayen yaad aane lagati, online professor se baat karne par maaloom hua, jo wo tasviren dekh rahaa he vah bughuul kii sultanate or is vaastavik duniya ke aane-jane kaa jariya he, adhikansh tasviren purv isaayiyon ne manhus qaraar kar nasht kar diya taaki koi agali vaardaat na ho
 Alison also now seems to have got rid of the trouble by burning the projector and the film, then he deletes all the other recorded films
 phir atic room taraf saamaan rakhane dauraan ellison kii hairaani kii thikaana nahin rahata jab use dobaaraa se vahi projector vaala baks paata or is baar uske haath kuch or ekstended film kii andig clip reel milti he
 While adding the ends of the last films of those extended cut endings, the call of Deputy Siewanski is also received by Alison only after the complete assembly of that film
 dipti kii mili jaankaree ke mutabik usne in silecelewar vaardaat kii kadi malumaat kii he, unke anusaar yah harek parivaar usee ghar main rahaa karte the jahaan gat parivaar kii katl kii vaardaat hui thi, or unke ghar badalane ke agle roj unki maut hoti he; jaise steevence family ke aane se pehle ve saint
 louis ke ghar par rahaa karte the jahaan millar family kii jibah kar katl hua tha, to millar family pehle dilasio ke ghar rahaa karte the jahaan dilasio family ke log laan main maare gaye, phir dilasio family to pehle secromento ke ghar par rahete the jahaan martin kii family ko unke hi gairaaj main khadi gaadi main jinda jala diya gaya or martin us pehle ghar main rahaa karti thi jahaan us shuruyaat family kii logon ke pul par dubne se maut hui thi or lagbhag ellison bhi apana thikaana badalakar usee vaardaat kii timeline main aa chukaa he, andeshaa he ki aglaa shikaar ab wo log ho sakate he
 The deputy warns him that the murderer may be around his house so be careful
 dipti kii kaal rakh ellison un sabhi footage ko dekhtaa he ki abhi tak ke sabhi parivaar ke katl ke jimmevaar vahi laapata bachche hi the, jo shaayad bughuul ke vasheebhoot hokar apana kaam ko anjaam dekar uske saamne hi gaayab ho rahe the
 Alison now takes another step and feels her head twitching, then she finds a note paper under her coffee cup that says 'goodnight Daddy' and then Alison collapses
 yahaan eshli usee ke peeche maujuudagi se jaahir hota he ki usee ne nasha diya he, vaise hi jaise steffni ne bughuul ke adheen hokar kiya tha
 Alison finds herself, her wife Tracy, and son Trevor tied hand and foot when they become aware, where everyone has tape stuck in their mouths
 yahaan eshli apane saath kulhadi or usee 8 mm camere ke saath ellison par jhukati hui vaada dilaati he ki vah use dubaara mashhoor kar degi
 agle drishy main ghar kii sabhi diwaron or daravaaje par kun se bani kute-billiyon, unicorn or pichhali vaardaat kii tasviren milti he
 And Ashley Khun draws a sketch of her family on the same box cover from the sketch in the hands where she had cut all three with an ax
 saamne chal rahi haal hi kii bani film main wo sabhi gumshuda bacchon kaa gut saamne aata he, jahaan eshli ke kaam hone baad bughuul ke dikhte hi bachche chupane bhaag jate he or bughuul apni god main eshli ko bithakar chalati film main hi gaayab ho jaataa he
 The projector box, placed in the Attic room of the Oswalt family's house, now shows another Ashley-related film with 'house painting' 12 'written on the label, and finally the film ends after bullying Bughoul

 Human activity has increased since the Industrial Revolution, which has led to a significant increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, which has also led to greatly increased diffuse bound CO 2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC and s nitrous
 Methane is more effective than greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but its concentration is so low that its radiative strength is only one f, compared to carbon dioxide
 Some other gases that are naturally occurring contribute to the greenhouse effect

 There is a possibility of higher CO2 levels in the future as there is a lot of change in fossil fuels and land use
 The rate of increase will depend on uncertain economic, social, technological and natural phenomena but perhaps the availability of fossil fuels will ultimately prove to be the deciding factor
 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the World tells of several future CO2 scenarios that last from the end of 2100 to 541 to 970 P

 The land in the northern hemisphere is more jiada, so it heats up faster than the southern hemisphere
 Seasonal ice and sea in the northern hemisphere There are extensive areas of ice that depend on ice-albedo feedback in the northern hemisphere, more than in the southern hemisphere
 Green house gases are emitted, but it is not responsible for the difference in heat as the major greenhouse gases stay for a long time and mix well in both hemispheres

 Surrey modern climate models are an abstract model in itself
 And this is different with the model of the sea and the model of ice on land and sea
 In some models chemical and biological Treatments of processes are also involved
 This model finds that if the effect of greenhouse gases is added, a warmer climate is attained
 Nevertheless, even when this assumption is used, climate sensitivity still has a large role

 yah singhaasana battisi kii duusari putali thi
 The story narrated by him is as follows
 ek din raja vikramaditya shikaar khelte-khelte ek unche pahaad par aae
 There he saw a monk doing penance
 sadhu kii tapasya main vighn nahin pade yah sochakar ve use shraddhapurvak pranaam karke lautne lage
 As he turned, the monk gave a voice and asked him to stop
 vikramaditya ruk gaye or sadhu ne unase prasann hokar unhen ek fal diya
 He said- "whoever eats this fruit will get a bright and famous son
 " fal praapt kar jab ve laut rahe the, to unki nazar ek tezi se daudti mahila par padi
 While running, came near a well and was eager to jump
 vikram ne use tham liya or is prakaar aatmahatya karne kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha
 The woman said that she had many girls but not a single son
 chunki har baar ladki hi janati he, isliye uskaa pati usase naaraaz he or gaali-galouj tathaa maar-peet karata he
 Tired of this predicament, she was going to commit suicide
 raja vikramaditya ne sadhu vaala fal use de diya tathaa aashwaasan diya ki agar uskaa pati fal khayega, to is baar use putr hi hoga
 a few days passed
 ek din ek brahman vikram ke paas aayaa or usne vahi fal use bhet kiya
 Vikram was deeply saddened by Sree's characterlessness
 brahman ko vidaa karne ke baad ve fal lekar apni patni ke paas aae or use vah fal de diya
 Vikram's wife was also characterless and loved the Kotwal of the city
 usne vah fal nagar kotwaal ko diya taaki uske ghar yashasvi putr janm le
 Nagar Kotwal was madly in love with a prostitute and gave the fruit to that prostitute
 veshya ne sochaa ki veshya kaa putr lakh yashasvi ho to bhi use saamaajik pratishtha nahin praapt ho sakati he
 After a lot of thinking, he concluded that Raja Vikramaditya is the real authority to eat this fruit
 uskaa putr usee kii tarah yogya or samadhryavan hoga to praja kii dekh-rekh acchhee taraha hogi or sabhi khush rahege
 Thinking this, he presented the fruit to Vikramaditya
 fal ko dekhakar vikramaditya thage-se rah gaye
 When they conducted an investigation, the illegal relationship between the city Kotwal and Rani came to know
 ve itane dukhi or khinn ho gaye ki rajya ko jyon kaa tyon chhodkar van chale gaye or kathin tapasya karne lage
 Since Vikramaditya was dear to gods and humans alike, Devaraja Indra sent a powerful god to protect the kingdom in his absence
 vah dev nripaviheen rajya kii badi mustaidi se raksha tathaa paharedaari karne laga
 After a few days Vikramaditya's mind started to see his subjects
 jab unhone apane rajya main pravesh karne kii cheshtaa kii to dev saamne aa khadaa hua
 In order to give him his real identity, Vikram fought and defeated him
 parajeet dev maan gaya ki use haraane vaale vikramaditya hi hai or usne unhen bataaya ki unka ek pichley janm kaa shatru yahan aa pahunchaa he or siddhi kar rahaa he
 He will make every effort to eliminate them
 yadi vikram ne uskaa vadh kar diya to lambe samay tak ve nirvighn rajya karenge
 After revealing everything about Yogi, the god took permission from the king and went away
 vikram kii charitraheen patni tab tak glani se vish khaakar mar chuki thi
 Vikram came and took over his coronation and all the work of the state started running smoothly
 kuch dinon ke baad unke darbar main vah yogi aa pahunchaa
 He gave Vikram a fruit which, when cut, turned out to be a precious red
 paritoshik ke badale usne vikram se unki sahaayta kii kaamana kii
 Vikram gladly got ready and walked with him
 ve donon shmashaan pahunche to yogi ne bataaya ki ek ped par vetaal latak rahaa he or ek siddhi ke liye use vetaal kii aavashyaktaa he
 He requested Vikram to take Betal down and bring him to him
 vikram us ped se vetaal ko utaar kar kandhe par ladakar laane kii koshish karne lage
 Betal would repeatedly take advantage of their inadvertence and fly away and hang on the tree
 aisa choubees baar hua
 Each time Betal narrates a story to Vikram on the way
 pachchisvin baar vetaal ne vikram ko bataaya ki jis yogi ne use laane bheja he vah dusht or dhokhebaaz he
 Today is the end of his Tantric siddhi and today he will sacrifice Vikram when Vikram bowes his head in front of Devi
 raja kii bali se hi uski siddhi puri ho sakati he
 Vikram immediately remembered the warning of Indra's god
 unhone vetaal ko dhanyavad diya or use ladakar yogi ke paas aae
 The yogi was overjoyed to see her and asked Vikram to bow his head at the feet of the goddess
 vikram ne yogi ko sar jhukaakar sar jhukaane kii vidhi batalaane ko kaha
 As Yogi bowed his head at the feet of the goddess, Vikram cut his neck with a sword
 devi bali paakar prasann huin or unhone vikram ko do vetaal sevak die
 He said that soon after remembering, these two will be present in the service of Betal Vikram
 vikram devi kaa aashish paakar anandpurvak waapas mahal laute
