 swytt tantrika pranali mukhya tantrika pranali kaa ek bhaag he jo mul rup se chetana ke str ke neeche niyantran tantra ke rup main kaary karti he or sahaj prakaaryon ko niyantrit karti he
 ANS has an effect on heart rate, digestion, breathing speed, salivation, sweating, diameter of pupils, micturition, and sexual stimulation
 haalanki iske adhikansh kaary avchetan rup se hote hai, phir bhi kuch chetan mastishk dwaara niyantrit kiye ja sakate hai jaise shwans lenaa
 It is originally thought to be divided into two sub-systems: the parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system
]] More recently, the third subsystem of neurons came to light, which is named 'non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic'
 , Neurones that were found to be fully integrated into autonomous functions and were similarly interpreted, they were used especially in the intestines
 And was found in the lungs
 prakaarya ke sambandh main, eenes ko aamtaur par samvedi or motor main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 Under the system, among these nuns, there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses
 tantrika tantra pranali kabhi kabhi swytt tantrika tantra kaa hissaa mana jaataa he autonomik, or kabhi kabhi ek swatantra pranali mana jaataa he
 The ANS is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and the anesthesia nervous system system
 tantrika tantra or parasympathetic sahanubhuti prabhag thoracolumbar "bahirvah" he, jiskaa arth he ki neurons ridh kii haddi ke vaksh or kaath bhaag main shuru
 parasympathetic prabhag crinioscrail "bahirvah" he, jiskaa arth he ki neurons kapaly tantrikaon par shuru or trik ridh kii haddi
 The ANS is specific in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway, the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ
 The reganglionic, or first neuron, will begin at the "outflow" and will synapse at the postganglionic, or second, neuron's cell body
 The post ganglionic neuron will then synapse on the target organ
 sahanubhuti prabhag L2 se T1 rassi sharir main cell hote hai parshv sing kii ridh kii haddiridh kii haddi) ke intermediolateral hai or pregnglionic neurons rahe hai
 There are several places in which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons: in gangliya postganglionic neurons se jo lakshya angon kii innervation prakaar pradaan karte hai
 Examples of pet-related veins are: in sabhi abhivahi ke rup main acchhee tarah se tantrikaon, bhi gavaa neurons ke rup main janaa hote hai
 Parasympathetic division involves cell clusters of one of two places: the brainstem or sacral spinal cord
 These are preganglionic neutrons that combine with postganglionic neutrons at these locations: ye ganglia postaganglionic neutron utpann karte hai jinase niyat angon kaa aachhadan ho jaataa he
 Examples of this are: ganitulate chaati or nodose gangliya, kapaal nason VII IX or eks in samvedi ko kramash sanlagn: samvedi haath "praathmik aant kaa samvedi neurons" paridhiy tantrika tantra main paaya "kapaal samvedi gangliya " main, se bana he neurons carbon dioxide or rakt, dhamniyon ke dabaav or pet or pet saamagree kii rasinic sanrachana main oxigen chini ke str kii nigaraanee
 
 rakt oxigen or carbon dioxide rahe hai vastav main sidhe manya sharir, manya dhamni ke bantwaare par ek chemosencorce ke chote sangrah, petrosal naadigranthi dwaara innervated dwaara mahasoos kiya
 The primary "second order" sensory neurons or project relay neurons, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract, located in the visceral sensory medulla oblongata, that integrate all visceral information
 The NTS also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the region posterema, that detects toxins in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and chemically induces vomiting or conditional taste
 All these visceral sensory information continuously and unconsciously modulate the movements of the motor neurons of the anus anas kii motor neurons bhi pien ke gangliya main sthit hai, "autonomik gangliya " kaha jaataa he
 They belong to three categories with different effects on their target organs: sympathetic, parasympathetic and intestinal
 prevertebral or purv mahadhamani shrinkhalaa: sahanubhuti gangliya do sahanubhuti zanjeeron main paas ridh kii haddi main sthit hai
 Parasympathetic ganglia, in contrast, the organs are located in the target for close proximity: the submandibular ganglion glands to close the saliva, etc
 to close the percutaneous heart ganglia 

 intestinal ganglia, which come in the digestive tube as their name Means are located within its walls and collectively form the complete spinal cord as local sensory neurons, motor neurons and these
 Ernurons are as many neurons, including

 The concept of citizenship arose from earlier laws
 pehle prakaar kii naagarikta is baat par aadhaarit thi ki log polis ke chote paimaane ke carbonic samudaayon main, kis tareeke se pracheen unani kaal main rahete the
 In those days citizenship was not seen as a public matter, it was separate from a person's private life
 naagarikta ke daayitv polis ke dainik jivan ke saath gaharaai se jude hue the
 To be truly human, one had to become an active citizen of the community, which Aristotle expressed in this way: "not participating in the affairs of the community means that either you are an animal or a deity
 ! " This form of citizenship was based on the obligations of citizens towards the community, instead the rights given to citizens in the community did not matter much
 yah ek samasya nahin thi kyonki ve sabhi log dridhtaa se polis ke saath jude the; unka apana bhagya or samudaay kaa bhagya ek duusare se prabalata se sambandhit the
 In addition, the polis saw their civil obligations as an opportunity to be religious, a source of respect and respect for them
 athens main, shaasha or shasit donon prakaar ke naagarik the, mahatvapurn rajnatik or nyaayik karyaalayon ko ghumaya jaataa tha or sabhi nagarikon ko rajnatik sabha main bolne or matdaan dene kaa adhikaar hota tha
 However, an important aspect of the citizenship of the polis was uniqueness
 pracheen greece or rome tathaa madhyakaalin shaharon main naagarikta, jo polis kii naagarikta kaa anusaran karti thi, vah vishisht thi or asamanta kii sthiti ko vyapak rup se sweekrut kiya jaataa tha
 The level of citizens was much higher than that of non-citizens
 gaiyr nagarikon main mahilaayein, gulam or 'barberian' shaamil the
 For example, women were considered unable and irrational for political participation
 Methods of determining whether an individual can be a citizen may be based on property, political participation, or inheritance
 roman samrajya main, polis naagarikta main parivartan aayaa: naagarikta chote paimaane ke samudaay se purna samrajya main vistrut ho gayi

 There are many temples of Naina Devi with this name: - anterdahan ingine aisa ingine he jisamen eendhan evam oxykaarak sabhi taraf se band ek belanakaar dahan kaksh main jalte hai
 In this process of combustion, often the air acts as an oxidizer
 jis band kaksh main dahan hota he use dahan kaksh kehete hai
 This combustion reaction is exothermic which produces high temperature and high pressure gases
 ye gaisen dahan kaksh main lage hue ek piston ko dhakelti hue failtin he
 The piston is connected to a crank shaft through a connecting rod, thus when the piston moves downwards the crank shaft attached to the connecting rod starts to rotate, thus converting the chemical energy of the fuel into first thermal energy and then thermal Energy is converted into mechanical energy
 anterdahan ingine ke vipareet bahirdahan ingine, main kaary karne vaala taral kisi anya kaksh main kisi taral ko garam karke praapt kiya jaataa he
 Often the piston reciprocating engine, in which combustion occurs after a period of time, is called the internal combustion engine, but jet engines, most rockets and many gas turbines also fall under the category of internal combustion engines in which combustion is going on continuously
 is
 aajkal automobile main prayukt adhikansh ingine anterdahan ingine hi hote hai
 The idea of the invention of the combustion engine began in the medieval period
 1680 i
 main dach vaigyanik chrishchiyan higes ne ek urdhv silinder or piston ke ingine kaa suzav rakhaa tha, jisamen barood ke visphot se piston upar chadhe
 But this type of engine never worked
 baad main dahansheel gaison tathaa khanij tailon ke avishkaar se unka suzav vyaavhaarik ho gaya kyonki barood kii jagah idhan dene kii samasya sulajh gai
 But still many years of practical and theoretical studies were needed to make the engines of this class compatible with practical utility
 antardahan injanon main idhan ke rup main dijal, petrol, alcohol athwa prakritik yaa kritrim gas ityadi kaa prayog hota he
 But generally petrol and diesel are used only
 antardahan ingine do siddhanto par kaary karte hai - chaturghaat chakra or dwighat chakra In a four-stroke engine, the four-stroke suspension, compression, power and exhaust process is complete
 tathaa power jab banati he jab piston do baar Up and down hota he
 Meaning the crankshaft rotates twice

 Inertial locomotives have two species, direct-activated engines and amphibious active engines
 ekadish sakriy injanon main kaaryakari padaarth piston ke keval ek ore rahata he; ubhaydish sakriy injanon main donon ore
 They have a long cylinder and both parts of the piston have suction, compression etc
 adhikansh antardah ingine ekadish sakriy hote hai
 For example, engines in motorcars are of this type
 parantu bahuterey bade ingine ubhaydish sakriy banaae jate hai
 Amphibious active engines generate nearly twice as much energy as direct-activated engines and have a nominal increase in size, but there are many mechanical difficulties in building amphibious active engines
 isliye keval badi naav ke injanon main hi ubhaydish sakriy ingine laabh daayak hote hai
 On the other hand, steam engines and air compressors are usually made active amphibians, although this is not a mandatory rule
 aaj ke adhikansh antardahan ingine oto chakra ke siddhant par banate hai
 For simplicity of calculation, we can imagine that the two actions in a cycle are both sub-entropic and two constant
 kalpit chakra ke vishleshan main sugamawa ke liye maan liya jaataa he ki kaaryakari padaarth keval vaayu he
 It is also assumed that neither suction shock nor exhaust shock occurs
 is vishleshan ko vayumatrik vishleshan kehete hai
 In actual engines, gases are exhausted
 uske badale mana jaataa he ki sthir aaytan par gaisen thandi ho jaati hai
 The work is the same, whether the gases are discharged, whether they are cooled, in every case the heat generated by the burning of fuel remains the same
 jis dar se urja kaary main roopantarit hoti he use shakti kehete hai; yah samay ke ekak main kaary kii maatra he
 The work that is done on the piston of the engine with the piston moving back and forth is called the specified function and the power calculated according to the specified work is called the specified horsepower
 ingine kii dhuree tak jitna kaary pahunchataa he vah dhuree kaary athwa brake kaary kehalaata he or is kaary ke anusaar utpann shakti ko brake ashwashakti kehete hai
 Several grounds can be taken to determine how much power an internal engine can receive
 motorcar ingine banaanevaale apane vigyapanon main apane ingine kii mahattam shakti bataate hai, jo tab praapt hota he jab samast paristhitiyaan mahattam rup se anukool hoti hai
 But manufacturers of industrial engines generally determine the power of their engines according to the power generated at approximately the greatest thermal efficiency
 audyogic injanon kaa samarthy isi prakaar nirdhaarit karnaa uttam bhi he
 The reason is that if the engines are run at the prescribed capacity, then the fuel cost will be minimal and then they will be able to operate at higher power for some time if needed
 prayek antardahan ingine main praapt shakti isapar nirbhar rahata he ki piston kii ek daud main jitna idhan-vaayu-mishran silinder main pravisht hota he uskaa dravyaman kya he
 Therefore, the reasons for which this mass will decrease will reduce the power of the engine
 vaastavik ingine main idhan-vaayu-mishran ko ghataane badhaanevaale yantra se, jise prarodh kehete hai, tathaa antargrahan or nikaas vaalvon se mishran kii gati main kuch baadha padati he
 Therefore, while sucking the mixture, the pressure in the cylinder is less than the atmospheric pressure

 In theoretical calculations it is assumed that the pressure of the mixture within the cylinder is equal to the atmospheric pressure
 phir, silinder kaa bhitari prishth, tathaa mishranpurna apekshaakrit tapt rahete hai
 Therefore, on reaching the cylinder, the fuel mixture gets heated
 aaytan taap-daab niyam ke anusaar taap badhane ke kaaran silinder main mishran kaa dravyaman us dravyaman kii apeksha kam hota he jo thande rahane par hota
 Then, in the actual engine's cylinder space, even after the exhaust ambush is complete, the gases remain at higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure, and they spread to the cylinder at the start of the suction power
 inkaa daab vayumandaleey daab ke baraabar ho jane ke baad hi chushan kaa aarambh hota he
 Also, less than a calculated amount of theory, the mixture enters the cylinder
 ant main, ingine samudratal se jitani hi adhik oonchaai par kaam karegaa vahaan vayumandaleey daab utani hi kam hogi
 Therefore, according to mass, the amount of mixture that can enter the cylinder at sea level is less than the mixture will be able to enter the high places
 antardahan ingine kii aaytneey dakshata keval oonchaai badhane par hi nahin ghatati, vah ingine kii chaal badhane par bhi ghatati he
 Therefore, the supercharger is often installed in the engines used in the race competition and at high altitude engines
 is yantra main ek chota sa apkendriya pankhaa rahata he jo idhan-vaayu-mishran ko silinder main vayumandaleey daab ke kuch adhik daab par thuns detaa he
 Applying a supercharger increases the rectangular efficiency, even it can exceed 1
 oto chakra ke vishleshan main yah dikhaaya ja chukaa he ki sampeden anupaat badhaane se dakshata badhati he
 The same trend appears in real engines
 oto chakra ke anusaar kaam karanevaale injanon main chushan aghat main vaayu ke saath hi idhan bhi ghusata he or isliye sampeden aghat main bhi vah vartmaan rahata he
 When the compression ratio is kept too large, the fuel mixture explodes as soon as the compression exceeds a certain amount, that is, the fuel itself, ignites without sparking from the spark plug
 phir, yadi aisa na bhi hua, to spark plag kii chinagaari se jalanaa aarambh hone par sampeden lehren uthati hai, jo chinagaari ke paas jalte hue mishran ke aage aage chalati hai
 Due to these compression waves, the mixture away from the spark may itself burn, which is undesirable
 phir, silinder main kahin petrol aadi ke jaale avshesh ke dahakate rahane se, athwa piston ke bheetar bade petrol aadi ke jaale avshesh ke dahakate rahane se, athwa piston ke bheetar bade kisi avyav kii tapt nok se bhi idhan mishran samay ke pehle jal saktaa he
 Whenever the compressed mixture burns prematurely, its burning is explosive
 yah kaan se sunai padataa he - jaan padataa he ki kisi dhaatu ko hathode se thonka ja rahaa he
 Fear of explosions is more likely in quick-burning fuels
 pichhali kuch dashabdiyon main kai naveen khojein hui hai, jinase bina adhisphot hue sampeden anupaat adhik bada rakhaa ja saktaa he
 For example san 1920-25 ke lagbhag motorcar ke injanon main sampeden anupaat lagbhag 4
5 rahata tha; kabhi-kabhi to yah 3
5 hi rahata tha
 At present the ratio is 6
5 or more; In some engines, this ratio is up to 10
 injanon kii twara saadhaarant: chakkar prati minute main bataai jaati he parantu yah nirdhaarit nahin he ki kitne chakkar prati minute rahane par ingine ko inamen se kis vishesh varg main rakhaa jaae
 Additionally, the number of revolutions per minute in a high-speed steam engine has a velocity of 4,000 or more revolutions per minute for a very slow inhalation engine, but for a race competition the revolutions are around 6,000 per minute
 ve deazal ingine, jinamein chakkar prati minute lagbhag 1,000 hote hai teevrgati deazal kehalaate hai
 Larger size cylinders run slower than engines with smaller cylinders, because larger pistons are heavier and tend to be so jerky that they are harder to handle when changing direction of movement
 piston kaa veg bhi injanon kii gati kii seemaa nirdhaarit karata he, kyonki piston kaa veg bahut badhaane se ingine ghiskar sheeghra nasht ho jaataa he
 In motorcar engines, piston-velocity is now maintained at 2,800 feet per minute or even more
 deazal injanon main piston kaa ausat veg 1,000 or 1,200 foot prati minute ke bich rahata he
 The size of the engines is determined by the diameter of the cylinder and the race of the piston
 udaharant:, 12-18 inch ke ingine kaa arth yah he ki silinder kaa vyas 12 inch he or piston kii daud 18 inch he
 Modern motorcar engines have much more power than their predecessors 20-30 years ago

 prasav kaa arth hota he janan yaa bachche ko janm dena
 The birth of a child without any interruption after the completion of the prescribed period of pregnancy is called a simple and simple birth
 bachche ke janm ko dhyaan se dekhne par yah mahasoos hota he ki bachche ke janm lene kii vidhi ko ham teen bhaagon main baant sakate hai
 In the first part, the mouth of the cervix is opened and spread, in the second part the head is visible in the child and the third part in which the ovule comes out
 pratham bhaag bachche ke janm kaa pratham charan lagbhag 10 se 12 ghante yaa adhik samay kaa hota he
 The timing of the first stage depends on which child the woman has
 pehle bachche main yah charan adhik samay letaa he
 It takes less time in the second child and less time in the third child
 pratham charan main yoni kii deevaaron kaa patala hona, failana, khinchnaa or dhire-dhire karke bachche ke sir kaa khisakna hota he
 The stretched and stretched part of the vagina helps the cervix to come forward slowly
 is charan ke saath hi ek chikna padaarth bhi nikalataa he jo ki ek jhilli ke samaan hota he jisko sho kehete hai
 Sometimes the amniotic sac bursts simultaneously with sukuchan and amniotic fluid starts coming out
 doosraa bhaag bachche ke janm ke duusare charan main bachchedani kaa dabaav prayek do-do minute baad hota he tathaa aadhe yaa ek minute tak rahata he
 Due to this pressure, the child is slowly pushed down
 is charan main bachche kaa sir dekha ja saktaa he
 After this, the vagina gradually folds one layer over the other in the form of folds
 saadharantaya bachche kaa sir upar kii ore tathaa uskaa dhad neeche kii ore hota he
 Sometimes, the child is pressed with light hands from the stomach to remove the child with pain
 is charan main mahila ko lambi saans kaa vyaayaam laabhakaari hota he
 Because the woman has to exert pressure by stopping the breath
 kai baar bacchon ko nikaalane ke liye aujaaron kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 When the baby is born, when the baby comes out, the mother feels as if stool is coming out of their body
 prasav ke samay sabase pehle bachche kaa sir bahar aata he
 Then one shoulder, the other shoulder and later the entire torso comes out, the second phase is completed after the birth of such a child
 bachche ke janm lene ke baad sarvapratham bachche ke munh or naak ko saaf kiya jaataa he kabhi-kabhi bachche ke munh or saans kii nalika se chikne padaarth va anya dravon ko saaf karne ke liye mashin kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 After this, wrap the baby in a clean cloth so that the body temperature of the child is maintained
 janm ne baad bachche ke ankhon kii safai bhi aavashyak hoti he
 After the child is born, the child's breathing functionality, heartbeat, skin color, shaking and touching of the hands and feet are seen
 isko appegar kehete hai
 If the performance of the child is normal, after looking at the hands, feet, ears, excreta and back of the child, cleaning of the stomach of the child is done and obstruction of the food pipe is seen
 bachche ke janm kaa teesraa charan bachche ke janm hone se auval ko baahar aane ko teesraa charan kehete hai
 After the birth of a child, the child is connected to a pulse which is called a pulse
 yah safed, matamaila or rassi ke samaan akruti kaa hota he
 The heartbeat of its child can be felt
 yah bachche ko rakt or oxygen paryaatp maatra main pahunchaaya rahata he
 On the other hand, this pulse is attached to the oval, which is sticking to the wall of the mother's uterus, when the baby starts crying on the right side and its color turns pink, it means that the baby's heart and lungs start functioning
 In this stage, the pulse is cut at a distance of about 8 to 10 cm from the navel of the child by clamping it
 naad ko katkar yah dekhen ki yah jameen yaa kisi anya cheez se chhu na jaae kyonki yah sheeghra hi rog ko pakad letaa he or usase bachche ko rog ho saktaa he
 Therefore, after cutting it, it is advisable to put it on the stomach of the child, any medicine can also be applied on the cuticle of the child
 bachche kii kati hui naad 24 ghante ke andar dhire-dhire karke suukh jaati he
 In about 7 to 10 days, it dries and separates from the body and instead a button-shaped stain remains on the body, which is called the navel
 jab tak yah sharir par rahata he isaki dekharekh aavashyak hoti he
 It should be cleaned twice a day with the help of spirit with medical cotton and use of disinfectant medicine
 emniotic jhilli ke faadane ke baad yah naad baccha paidaa hone se pehle kai baar baahar nikal jaati he
 This condition suggests that the child is small, physical errors according to his time, the abnormal state of the baby in the womb or the excessive cause of amniotic fluid in the uterus
 bhaga se naad ke baahar aane par naad main rakt kaa bahaav kam hone lagata he bachche ke sir kaa dabaav tathaa maa ke kuulhe kii bich kii hadidyon ke bich naad par lagaataar dabaav padane ke kaaran kai baar rakt kaa sanchaar bilkul hi band ho jaataa he
 At this stage, the child dies in the womb due to low temperature and blood of the child
 isi kaaran is avasthaa main prasav kaa sheeghra karnaa yaa aaparishan ke dwaara prasav karana laabhadaayak hota he
 Many times this type of pulse is not known in the beginning
 is avasthaa ko maaloom karne ke liye bhaga dwaara jaanch kerani padati he
 In this case, childbirth does not happen quickly and the heartbeat of the child starts decreasing
 is kaaran yah aavashyak he ki jaise hi emnyotic jhilli fatati he
 At that time, the investigation of the woman should be done soon by breach
 aisi striyaan jinamein bachche kaa sir kuulhe par aakar na tikaa ho unamem naad kaa baahar aane kii sambhaavn bhi adhik hoti he or kuch samay baad yah swayan sookhkar gir jaati he tathaa bachche kii naabhi kaa nishaan jeevanaparyant ke liye rah jaataa he
 As soon as the baby's head comes out at the time of the birth of the child, it should be noted how much lubricated fluid is applied on the child's face because this lubricated fluid can make the baby difficult to breathe
 isi kaaran ek saaf kapade ke tukade dwaara bachche kaa cheharaa, naak or munh ko acchhee prakaar se saaf karnaa chahie
 The child can be hung upside down as soon as the baby is born
 jiske kaaran fefde aadi main gaya hua chikna drav munh main lautakar aa jaae or munh kaa drav fefdon main na ja paye
 For this reason it can be removed carefully by suction
 thodi si maatra main chiknayeeyukt drav fefdon main ja saktaa he
 But the baby's cry is not cured due to excessive amount of fluid going into the lungs
 aisi sthiti mren fefde main nalee daalkar ise nikaalnaa padataa he tathaa bachche ko davaaiyaan bhi shuru kerani padati he
 The first child's lungs are like a balloon without air
 parantu pehali baar saans lete hi fefde hawa se bhar jate hai
 Blood starts coming out of it and oxygenated blood reaches the child's heart from the lungs
 is avasthaa main bachche kaa hriday sheeghra hi kaary karne lagata he
 Meanwhile, the child's relationship is separated from the Oval
 bachchedani main kuch dard ke saath auval bhi dhire-dhire bachchedani kii deevaaron kii pakad ko chhodane lagati he tathaa dhire-dhire karke puraa auval alag hokar isi dwaar se baahar aa jaati he
 Sometimes it may take 10 minutes to half an hour for the oval to come, in such a situation, a mild massage of the mother's abdomen may also have to be done
 yadi iske baad bhi auval baahar nahin aata he to use ritand auval kehete hai
 As soon as Oval comes out, Oval should be seen properly
 yadi auval kaa ek bhi tukdaa nahin aa paaya to phir bachchedani puri taraf se sikud nahin paati tathaa raktasrav hota rahata he
 The child becomes somewhat blue as soon as the child is born
 parantu bachche ke rone se aksigen or rakt bachche ke sharir main sancharit hone lagata he
 Due to this, the color of the child becomes pink
 bachche ke sharir par safed chiknaiyukt padaarth laga rahata he
 This greasy material is called varnix
 bachche ko saaf kapade se ponchney yaa bachche ko snaan karaane se yah chiknayeeyukt drav sharir se baahar aa jaataa he
 There is some swelling on the face of the child, eye shadow and some part of the child's head is visible, which is called caput
 yah sab samay ke saath thik ho jaataa he
 The muscles that are thrust on the head when the baby is born
 usase caput ban jaataa he
 But it resolves within a few days
 bachche ke janm ke samay bachche kii chaati kuch badi hui hoti he
 If there is a girl in delivery
 to uske mutradwar ke donon ore kii twachaa lebia kuch adhik bhuri or suji hui hoti he or kuch bhaag baahar nikalataa dikhaai detaa he
 Sometimes a little blood also comes, similarly in the boy, the enlargement of the testicles or the appearance of some light blue and brown color are common things which change according to the time
 garbhavastha ke samay mahila ko yah nirnay le lenaa chahie ki unhen prasav ghar main yaa hospital main karwaanaa he
 a woman should be consulted by a gynecologist during pregnancy
 dwadashi shiya yaa barahave shiya yaa imami shiya shiya islam kii sabase badi shakha he
 It is believed that the first twelve Imams were divinely chosen
 inaki manyata he ki barahave imam jo 873-874 isvi main gaayab ho gaye the, bhavishya main laut kar aayenge

 puure shiya samudaay main se lagbhag 85% barahave shiya hi hote hai
 The twelfth Shi'a beliefs come from other related communities such as Zaidi Shia and Ismaili Shia although they disagree about the number of Imams and the succession of one Imam to the next Imam
 yah imam kii bhoomika or paribhaasha ko lekar bhi aapas main asahmat hai
 Those who follow this connection are called the twelve Emami or Ishanashri Shia

 They may appear to the victim in the form of stains, formulas, blocks or nets
 chunki ye vastue aankh ke bheetar maujuud hai, lekin ve drushtibhram nahin kar rahe hai balki ye ghatana antoptik hai
 a special type of float ingot is called Muskaya volantantes, or mouches volantes and consists of small stains
 ve adhiktar logon kii aankhon main maujuud hote hai or chote chote bhrun sambandhit avasheshon ke netrakachabh drav main ekatra hone se banate hai
 The floating bodies float in the ocular fluid
 is prakaar, ve aam taur par ankhon kii teevr gati kaa ghoomte hai, jabaki taral padaarth ke bheetar dhire dhire behate hai
 When they are first seen, the natural reaction is to try to look at them directly
 haalanki, unase apni drushti hataanaa mushkil hota he kyoki plavamaan pind drushti kii disha ke kinare par rahete hue aankh ke saath chalate hai
 Floating bodies are particularly noticeable when looking at empty surfaces, open spaces such as blue skies

 In 2002, a survey of ophthalmologists reported that only in the UK did an expert receive an average of 14 patients with floating nodules every month
 haalanki, plavamaan pind, gambhir maamalon main, ek baadha se badhakar ek vikarshan hai, khaskar yadi jab ye drushtikshetra main nirantar gatisheel rahete hai
 The reflection of these figures is made up of small structures of proteins and broken cells that have been gathering on the retina for years
 plavamaan pind ko band aankhon se bhi dekha ja saktaa he, khaskar prakaashmaan dinon main, jab paryaapt prakaash palken ko bhedakar chhavi banaata he
 It is not, however, the case that only elderly people suffer from the floral nodules
 ve jawan logo ko bhi pareshaan kar sakate hai, khaas taur par jab ve adoordarshee hon
 ve aghat kar rahe hai yaa baad bhi aam ke motiyobind aapareshnon kuch maamalon main, plavamaan pind janmajaat hote hai
 Floating bodies can refract light in such a way that the vision is temporarily obstructed until they move to another area
 Often they give the dal to the victim because they see something from the corner of their eye which is not really there
 samay ke saath zyaadaatar peedit he, unke plavamaan pind andekha karnaa sikh jate hai
 It is almost impossible for people with severe float bodies to completely ignore the large tufts in their stair sight

 jivan ke baad ke charnon main hi, jab netrakachabh drav drushtipatal se alag hota he, yah pratyaksh rup se dikhta he
 Due to their subtle size they cannot be seen by professional doctors
 They appear large due to their proximity to the retina
 is prakaar ke plavamaan pind tisare dashak main abhi bhi varnit he or kabhi kabhi bahut mushkil se hi 40 se adhik aayu main dekhe gaye hai
 There are many reasons for having a float body, mostly explained here
 aankhon ko kisi bhi prakaar ki kshati jiske kaaran koi padaarth netrakachabh drav main pahunch jaae, plavamaan pind utpann kaa saktaa he
 The main reason for the formation of a floating mass is the shrinking of the ocular fluid: this gel-like fluid contains 99% water and 1% solids
 thos bhaag kolagen or hyluronic amla ke ek network se bana hota he
 Hyaluronic acid contains water
 is network ke dapolmeriotion se hyluronic acid pani chhod detaa he
 Collagen breaks down to form fine fibers which eventually make the patient pinch as a floating mass
 is tarah ke plavamaan pind kam sankhya ke rekhik reshe hote hai
 Over time the vitreous loses its base and its outline is shrinking lagti
 is kaaran se pichhlaa netrakachabh tuutane lagata he, jisame grahanshil retina se netrakachabh nikalne lagata he
 During this isolation, shrinkage can stimulate the retinal retina, causing the patient to see random flashes, known as "flashers", a symptom formally known as photopsia
 netra tantu sir ke chaaron ore netrakachabh kaa antim nikaas kabhi kabhi plavamaan pind banaata he, jo ek badi anguthi ke aakaar main aam taur par dikhaai detaa he, 
 retina netrakachabh ke jane se fat saktaa he, jise retinal detament kehete hai
 It has been seen many times that this causes blood to seep, which appears as several small dots that rotate across the area
 retina ke tuutane par tatkaal chikitsa kaa suzav diya jaataa he kyonki isse andhaapan paidaa ho saktaa he
 Consequently, both the brightness and the sudden appearance of several small floating bodies should be investigated immediately
 netrakachabh se jaati hui dhamni, kaanchaabh dhamni, ek vikaas ke charan ke dauraan garbhavastha kii teesri timahi main rog ke lakshan dikhaati he
 Its disintegration sometimes leaves parts of the cell
 retinal aansuo se peedit rogi plavamaan pind dekhte hai agar unki laal khun kii koshikaaye risati hai
 In previous blood vessels such as uveitis and vitreous, toxoplasmosis, patients experience multiple floral nodules and vision deterioration
 plavamaan pind ke liye anya kaaran-hyalosis, aashayabh dhabbedaar adema baad vaala netrakachabh drav ke liye ek visangati he, calcium kollaagen se jud jaataa he
 The bodies which are formed rotate with the eye, but return to their original place
 kabhi kabhi ke plavamaan pind kii upasthiti ke liye aansu film ke kaale dhabbo ko jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he
 Technically, these are not float bodies, but they appear to be from the patient's point of view
 dushkriy mibomian granthi yaa blapheritis peedit isse vishesh rup se grast he, lekin aankh kaa allergy bhi ye samasya paidaa kar sakati hai
 Curl the eyelids to differentiate between the contents of the ocular fluid and the debris of the tear layer - the debris moves from it, although it does not have a special effect on the floating nodules and by removing the possibility of occlusion of the eye macula and the floating layer we can remove the debris of the tear layer
 Can guess right plavamaan pind tatkaal aksar netrarog visheshgy yaa ek optomtrist dwaara deepak bhattha yaa ophthalmoscope kii madad se pataa laga liye jate hai
 However, if the floater is near the retina, it is not visible to the observer although it may be large for the victim
 prishthbhumi roshni badhaane yaa ek pinhole upyog karne se prabhavi dhang se putali kaa vyas kam kiya ja saktaa he, ek vyakti ko apane khud plavamaan pind kaa ek behatar drushti praapt karne detaa he
 The head may be tilted such that a floating object moves in the direction of the central axis of the eye
 Fibrous elements become more distinct in a sharp image
 plavamaan pind kii nai shuruyaat ke saath retina ansu kii upasthiti ascharyajanak thi, jaisaa ki vaazib naidanik pariksha siries main bhaag ke rup main american medical association ke jarnal main prakashit madhya-vishleshanmen bataaya gaya tha
 Ophthalmologic evaluation must be done to those who feel a glowing eye or a glow in the eye
 aam taur par koi ilaaj nahin bataaya jaataa 
 The second optics is the fiber and the third is the vitrector
 The vitrector is a front and back bite tip with a suction device attached
 is dizin se netrakachabh drav ke madhyam se retina par kaanch karshan kam karata he
 a type of seamless, self-printing technique is sometimes used
 vitrectomi ke mukaable iske kam dushprabhav hai
