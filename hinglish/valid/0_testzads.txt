 japan ne apane samrajyavad kaa mukhya lakshya china ko banaaya or sarvapratham korea main usne china ke saath apni shakti kaa prayog kiya
 Korea was extremely important to Japan socially and politically because of its geographical location
 isliye korea prayadweep main japan kii bahut ruchi thi
 The Manchu emperors of China had annexed Korea in the 17th century and since then Korea was considered a subordinate state of China
 yadhyapi korea kaa apana pruthak raja hota tha, kintu korea kaa swatantra raja china ke samrat ko apana adhipati sweekaar karata tha
 In this way, the kingdom of Korea was similar to a protected state of China
 korea prayadweep main japan kaa paramparaagat swaarth tha lekin, abhi tak japan ko is swaarth ko puraa karne kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 But now militarism was born in Japan
 atah yah aavashyak ho gaya ki vah korea ke sambandh main ugr niti kaa avlamban kare
 At this time Korea was stuck in the whirlwind of the imperialist policy of European states, in which case Korea could get out of China and take possession of any European country
 isliye japan kii chintaa badi or usne tay kiya ki vah korea ko uske bhagya par nahin chhod saktaa
 In 1875, a Japanese ship reached the coast of Korea
 korea kii sarkaar ne is jahaaj par golabari shuru kar di
 For this reason, the militant Japanese leaders started demanding to declare war against Korea
 lekin, us samay japan ke adhikariyon ne sanyam se kaam liya
 Instead of waging war against Korea, he decided to send a messenger to Japan, which would prompt the government there to enter into a trade treaty with Japan

 The Chinese government sent a corps of Chinese soldiers, but according to the agreement of 1885 AD, Japan did not give information to Japan earlier and later
 japan ne virodh kiya ki itani badi sankhya main china ke sainikon kaa korea main pahunchnaa sandhi kii shartaan ke viruddh tha
 In return, the Japanese rulers also duly informed China and sent seven thousand soldiers to Korea
 china or japan kii senaaon ke korea main ghusane ke pehle hi korea kii sarkaar ne balve ko dabaa diya
 But two foreign forces stood on the land of Korea
 aisa prathit hua ki donon ke madhya kisi bhi kshan yuddh chhid jayega
 In August 1894, a Chinese ship was going to Korea with Chinese troops
 japan ne maarg main hi use pakad liya or, chunki ukt jahaaj ne aatmasamarpan nahin kiya, atah us par akraman kar diya gaya, falswaroop prayek chini yatri samudr main dubo diya gaya
 Enraged by this incident, China declared war on Japan on August 1, 1894, and thus the First sino-japanese War began
 yah yuddh lagbhag nau maheenon tak chalaa jisamen japaniyon kii vijay hui
 Japan's military preparations were excellent
 japan kii dedh lakh sena ko shreshth prashikshan diya gaya tha
 Japanese soldiers were paid as much as possible and their generals were experienced and highly qualified
 unhen gola-barood or anya rasad kii vastuen yathasamay tathaa aavashyaktaanusaar milti thim
 The Japanese Navy had a large number of passenger ships, which quickly transported military or munitions from one field to another

 In addition, China's governance was also corrupt and corrupt

 In fact, China never had any success until the start and end of the war

 One Japanese army invaded Manchuria and the other attacked the Liaotung Peninsula

 Early in 1895, the Japanese forces reached Shantung, which was located at the other end of Korea

 Japan took control of several Chinese defense posts in the north

 14 agast 1947 ko bharat vibhajit hua or purv or pashchim main ek nae desh pakistan ne janm liya
 The dream of Quaid Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan came true
 nayaa desh banane ke saath hi desh ke liye vibhinn chinh or pratik chunane kaa kaam bhi shuru hua
 The country's flag was already prepared, but the national anthem was not made
 azaadi ke samay pakistan ke paas koi raashtra-geet nahi tha
 Therefore whenever the flag was chanted, "pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Pindabad" slogans were raised
 jinnah ko yah manzur nahi tha
 He wanted that the work of creating the national song of Pakistan should be completed soon
 unke salaah kaaron ne unako anekon janemaane urdu shaayaron ke naam sujhaaye jo geet rach sakate the
 But Jinnah's thinking was different
 unhen laga ki duniya ke samaksh pakistan kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi sthapit karne kaa yah acha mauka he
 So he told the great Urdu poet and native Hindu Jagannath Azad of Lahore that "I can give you only five days, you can write a national song for Pakistan"
 jagannatha azaad achambhit bhi the or khush bhi the
 But the radical leaders of Pakistan were very angry that a Hindu would write the national anthem of Pakistan
 lekin jinnah kii marzi ke aage ve bebas the
 Finally, within five days Jagannath Azad composed the national song which Jinnah liked very much
 gane ke bol the - Oh my heart, your love is better than mine, today your happiness is nowhere jinnah ne ise raashtra-geet ke rup me manyata di or unki mrityu tak yahi geet raashtra-geet bana rahaa
 But just 18 months after the acceptance of this song, Jinnah died and with him the recognition of the national song was ended
 jagannatha azaad baad main bharat chale aae
 After Jinnah's death, the Government of Pakistan formed a rashtra-geet Committee
 or jane maane shairo ke paas se geet ke namoonay mangavaaye
 But no song was able to become a national song

 At the same time, Shah of Iran visited Pakistan and liked the tune
 yah dhun paashchaatya adhik lagati thi, lekin raashtra-geet cameti kaa maananaa tha ki iskaa yah swaroop paashchaatya samaaj me adhik sweekrut hoga
 In 1954, Urdu poet Hafiz Jalandhari composed a song based on this tune
 yah geet raashtra-geet cameti ke sadasyon ko pasand bhi aayaa
 And finally the song written by Hafiz Jalandhari became the national song of Pakistan

 Madhav of Sangamagrama was a famous Kerala mathematician-astronomer, from Erannalakkuta, a town near the Cochin district of Kerala state, India
 inhen keraly ganit sampradaay kaa sansthaapak mana jaataa he
 He was the first person to develop a series of infinite approximations, which is called "a decisive step beyond the infinite method of ancient mathematics in taking boundary-shifts to infinity"
 unki khoj ne ve raste khol die, jinhen aaj ganitiya vishleshan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Madhavan pioneered the study of infinite series, calculus, trigonometry, geometry and algebra

 Some scholars have also given the idea that Madhava's works have also been transmitted to Europe through the Kerala school, by Jesuit missionaries and merchants who at the time were quite active around the ancient port of Kochi

 Madhava was born as Iannarappilly or Ianninavalli Madhavan Namboodiri

 Although there is evidence of some mathematical work in Kerala even before Madhava, it is clear from the references that Madhava provided a creative impulse for the development of a rich mathematical tradition in medieval Kerala
 haalanki, madhav ke adhikansh moulik kaary kho chuke hai
 He has been mentioned in the works of his successive mathematicians, especially in Neelkanth Somayaji's Tantra Collection as a proliferation of infinite series comprising several sinθ and arctanθ
 In the sixteenth-century text Mahagyanayana type Madhava has been cited as the source of several series derivatives of π
 jyeshthadev kii yuktibhaasha joki malayalam bhashaa main likhi gayi he, main yah shreniyan 1 / , jahaan x = tan θ aadi, jaise bahupadon ke liye tailor shrenee ke prasar ke rup main pramaanon ke saath prastut kii gayi hai
 Thus, exactly what actions are done by Madhava is a matter of controversy
 yukti-deepika, sambhawatah jyeshthadev ke shishy, sankar variyaar dwaara rachit he, yah sin θ, cos θ or arctan θ ke liye shrenee prasar ke anek praaroop prastut karti he, saath hi saath trigya or vruttkhand kii lambaai ke kuch gunanfal bhi, jiske adhikansh sanskaran yuktibhaasha main bhi dikhaayi padate hai
 That category, which has been argued by Rajagopal and Rangachari, is not widely quoted from the original Sanskrit language, and since some of these categories are attributed to Madhava by Neelkanth, it is likely that some of the other forms are also Madhav
 Can be done in the works of only
 anya logon ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki praarambhik rachana karnapaddati, yaa mahageanyan prakaar sambhawatah madhav dwaara likhit ho sakate hai, lekin isaki sambhaavna bahut kam he
 The Karnapaddhati, as well as Kerala's more ancient mathematics work Sadratnamala and Tantrasangraha and Yuktibhasha, are considered in an article by Charles Matthew Whish of 1834, the first article to draw attention to Newton in his pursuit of fluency

 There are many known astronomers who came before the period of Madhavan, there were also Kutalur Kizhar, Varruki, Sankaranarayana
 Other unknown persons may also have existed in their former times
 However, we have a clear account of the period after Madhavan
 parameshwar namboodiri unke ek pratyaksh shishy the
 According to the palmistry manuscript of a Malayalam commentary of Surya Siddhanta, Neelkanth Somayaji was a disciple of Damodar, the son of Parameswara
 jyeshthadev nilkanth ke shishy the
 Achyuta Pisharati, who was from Trikkantiyur, is also mentioned as a disciple of Jyeshthadeva and Grammarian Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri was a disciple of Achyutha

 yah anant shrenee kii ore vah parivartan hi he, jiske liye madhav ko shrey diya jaataa he
 In Europe, the first such category was developed in 1667 by James Gregory
 shrenee ke sambandh main madhav kaa kaary ullekhneey he, lekin vah baat jo vastav main asaadhaaran he, vah unke dwaara kiya gaya truti pad kaa moolyankan he
 This shows that he had understood the boundary related nature of infinite series very well
 atah, madhav ne hi anant shrenee prasar ke anternihit vichaaron, ghaat shrenee, trikoshmitiya shrenee or anant shrenee ke parimey nikataagaman ke vichaaron kaa avishkaar kiya hoga
 However, as stated above, it is somewhat difficult to determine purely the results given by Madhava and the results given by his predecessors
 neeche un parinaam kaa saransh diya ja rahaa he, jinke liye vibhinn vidwaanon dwaara madhav ko shrey diya gaya he
 Under his numerous contributions, he discovered infinite series for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent and arctangent and also found several methods for calculating the circumference of a circle
 There is a category of Madhava known from the book Yuktibhasha, which includes proof and representation of the power series of inverse tangents, it was discovered by Madhava
 pustak main jyeshthadev is shrenee kii vyakhya is prakaar karte hai
 This will yield r θ = r sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ θ - r 3 3 + r 5 5 - r 7 7 +

 Today, it is known as the madhava-gregory-leibniz category
 madhav ne jyaaon ke liye sabase upyukt saarini bhi di, jo die gaye vrutt ke chaturthaansh par samaan antaraal par khinchi gayi ardh-jya jeevon ke maanon ke rup main paribhaashit thi
 It is believed that he would have obtained this very accurate table based on the following category of spreads: nimnlikhit shloke main madhav ne vrutt kii paridhi or uske vyas kaa sambandh bataaya he jo is shloke main bhootsankhya ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya gaya he- This means- The circumference of a circle of diameter 9 x 1011 will be 2872433388233
 π ke maan ke sambandh main madhav ke kaary kaa ullekh hamen mahageanyanaprakaar main mila jahaan kuch vidwaan jaise sarma, kaa yah maananaa he ki ho saktaa he yah pustak swayan madhav ne hi likhi ho, vahiin duusari ore iske 16veen shatabdi ke parvartiyon dwaara likhe jane kii sambhaavna adhik he
 This book credits Madhava itself for several expansions and gives the following infinite series expansions for π, now known as the madhava-leibniz series: jise unhone chaap-sparshajya falan ke ghaat shrenee prasar se praapt kiya tha
 However, the most striking thing is that he also gave a correction term, Rn, for the error that came after the computation up to n terms
 madhav ne Rn ke teen praaroop die the jo nikataagaman ko sanshodhit karte the, isane naam hai Where the third modification results in a very precise calculation of π
 is prakaar ke sanshodhan pad tak kaise pahunche
 The most reliable fact is that they come as the first three convergence of continuous fractions that can themselves be derived from the standard near value of π, 62832 / 2 xxrep 4 0 
 unhone π kii mul anant shrenee ke roopantaran dwaara anant shrenee praapt karke, ek or bhi shighratapurvak abhisaarit hone vaali shrenee di thi By using the first 21 terms to calculate the nearest value of π, he obtained a value that was correct to 11 places in the decimal
 The value of 3
1415926535898 corrected to 13 places of the decimal, was also sometimes credited to Madhav
 is
 lekin yah shaayad yah unke kisi shishy ke dwaara diya gaya he
 It was one of the most accurate closest values of π since the fifth century

 is aadhaar par, aar
 gupta ne yah tark diya he ki ho saktaa he yah pustak bhi madhav dwaara hi likhi gayi ho
 Madhava also researched other ranges of length of the segment and the nearest value of rational fractions of π related to it, he discovered polynomial diffusion methods, convergence test for infinite series and analyzed infinite continuous fraction numbers
 unhone punrariti dwaara gudh samikarnon kaa bhi hal niklaa or satat bhinn sankhyaon ke dwaara gudh sankhyaon kaa nikatatam maan bhi praapt kiya
 Madhava laid the foundation for the development of calculus, which his successors developed further at the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics
 madhav ne bhi pracheen kaaryon se praapt kuch parinaamon ko aage badhaayaa, jisame bhaskar II ke kaary bhi sammilit the
 In calculus, he used the initial form of differential, integral, and he or his disciples developed the integral of ordinary functions
 ke
ve
 sharma ne madhav ko nimnlikhit pustakon kaa rachayita bataaya he: After Madhavan, the Kerala Mathematics community flourished for at least two centuries
 jyeshthadev se hamen samakalan kaa vichaar mila, jise sankalitam kaha gaya tha,, jaisaa ki is kathan main he: Which translates the integral as a variable that will equal half the square of the variable; That is, the integral of x dx will be equal to x2 / 2
 yah spasht rup se samakalan kii shuruyaat he
 Another result related to this says that the area inside a curve is equal to its integral
 isamen se adhikansh parinaam europe main aise hi parinaamon ke astitv se kai shatabdiyon purv ke hai
 In many ways, Jyeshthadeva's Yuktibhasha can be considered the world's first book on calculus
 madhav ko "madhya yug kaa mahanatam ganitagya-khagolgy" kaha gaya he, yaa"ganitiya vishleshan kaa sansthaapak; is kshetra main unke kuch anusandhan yah prakat karte hai ki unke andar asaadhaaran antargyaan pratibha thi
 "
 According to o'connor and Robertson, a proper evaluation of Madhava would be in the following words
 He took a decisive step towards modern classical analysis
 malabar samudr tat par europea disha nirdeshkon se pehle sampark ke dauraan, 15veen-16veen shatabdi main kerala skool kaaphi prasiddh tha
 At that time, the port of Kochi located near Sangamgram was a major center for maritime trade and there were many missionaries and traders active in the region

 joseph bhi shaamil hai, ne kaha ki is kaal ke dauraan kerala skool se lekh europe pahunche hai, jo newton ke samay se ek shatabdi ke purv kaa samay tha
 Although no European translation of these writings exists, it is possible that these ideas may have influenced later European developments in analysis and calculus
 
this was due to not understanding the ideas of the author properly
 16 veen shatabdi main jesut ke log, jo madhavan or unke shishyon kii pratishtha se parichit the, ke liye yah lagbhag asambhav tha ki ve sanskrit or malayalam kaa adhyayan karke ise europea ganitagyon tak pahunchaaen, iske sthaan par ve khud hi is khoj ko karne kaa daawa karte hai

 yah khel do yaa chaar khilaadiyon dwaara ek vargakar board par khelaa jaataa he jisamen 15-bata-15 grid ke khaane bane hote hai, jinamein se prayek apane bheetar ek ekal akshar tile ko sthaan detaa he
 In official clubs and tournament games, the game is always played between two players
 is khel main 100 tilein hoti hai, jinamein se 98 main ek akshar or 1 se 10 ke bich main ek ank mulya ankit hota he
 The number of digits inscribed on each tile is based on the frequency in standard English writing of the letter inscribed on that tile, a digit commonly used letter such as e or O, while less frequently used letters for more marks
 Are, such as q and z have 10 digits
 is khel main do rikt tilein bhi hoti hai jo achihnit hoti hai or jin par koi ank mulya nahin hota
 Once placed on the board, these blank tiles can be used as a replacement for any letter, however, they are preordained
 board ko bade "premium" dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he, jo arjeet kiye gaye ankon kii sankhya ko badha detaa he: jaise gaharaa laal "tihare shabd" varg, gulabi "dohare shabd" varg, gaharaa nila "tihare akshar" varg or halkaa nila "dohare-akshar" varg
 board ke madhya kaa varg praayah ek sitare yaa logo dwaara chihnit hota he or ek dohare shabd varg ke rup main gina jaataa he
 In the notation system commonly used in tournament games, the columns are marked "A to O" and the rows "1 to 15"
 This game is typically in the format of xy word score or word xy score
 , Where x specifies the columns or rows on which the main word of the game is formed, y specifies the second coordinate of the first letter of the key word, and WORD is the main word
 haalanki yah anaavashyak he, parantu khel ke dauraan bane atirikt shabdon ko samay-samay par mukhya shabd or ek slash ke baad soochibaddh kiya jaataa hai
 In the case where words are formed in each direction by placing a single tile, one of those words is arbitrarily selected for marking as the main word
 jab ek mukhya shabd main ek rikt tile kaa istamaal kiya jaataa he tab jis akshar kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye use laayaa jaataa he use chote aksharon, yaa, hastlikhit ankan dwaara nirdisht kiya jaataa he, jisamen akshar ke chaaro ore ek varg bhi banaaya jaataa he
 Sometimes a bracket is also used to designate a blank, although this can cause confusion with another function of the bracket, ie any existing letter or word that is played through the main word's " "gone, to nominate him
 udhaaharan 1: adition D3 74 khel se pehle, akshar tilon ko yaa to ek apaardarshee bag main yaa ek samtal sthaan par ulta karke rakhaa jaataa he
 Opaque cloth bags and customized tiles are a staple in clubs and tournaments, where the game is rarely played without these two
 aage, khilaadi yah tay karte hai ki ve kis kram main khelenge
 iske liye jo saamaanya tarika apanaaya jaataa he vah yah he ki khiladiyon ko tilein nikaalani padati hai or jo khilaadi varnmaala kii shuruyaat ke nikatatam akshar ko uthaata he vah shuruyaat karata he 
 In North American tournaments, according to us-based North American Scrabble Players Association rules, players who have finished first in the tournament in a minimum number of games have preference, or if they have failed, those who finished second have a preference
 ek barabari ke maamle main, tiles ko, maanak niyamon ke anuroop taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 At the beginning of the game and after each turn, until the bag is empty, players take out tiles to fill their "racks" or tile holders with seven tiles from which they begin the game
 prayek rack, anya khilaadiyon se chupa hota he
 During the turn, a player has seven or fewer letter tiles in his rack from which he selects a game
 har baari par, ek khilaadi ke paas vikalp hota he: paas, baari ko ganvaana or shunya ank arjan, bag se samaan sankhya ke liye ek yaa adhik tiles kii adla-badali, shunya ank arjan, ek vikalp jo keval tabhi uplabdh hota he jab bag main kam se kam saat tiles hon, yaa board par ek khel nirmaan karen, khilaadi ke sanchayi ank main iske maan ko joden
 In a proper game any number of tiles of the player can be used to form a continuous word on the board, which can be read either left to right or top to bottom
 mukhya shabd aisa hona chahie jisamen yaa to purv-prayukt shabdon ke aksharon kaa upyog hona chahie, yaa phir uske, kam se kam ek tile ko pehle khele ja chuke shabd se kshaitij rup main yaa anulamb rup main judaa hona chahie
 If words other than key words are created for the first time in the game, they are also earned and are subject to the same criteria for acceptance
 jab board rikt hota he, to khele gaye pehle shabd ko H8 ko jo kendriya varg he aavashyak rup se aavrutt karnaa chahie
 The word must consist of at least two letters, extending horizontally or vertically
 H8 ek premium varg he, isliye ek shabd ko khalene vaala pratham khilaadi ek doharaa ank praapt karata he
 a blank tile can replace any letter
 vah tile us akshar ke rup main shesh khel ke liye bana rahata he
 Personally, it does not earn any points, regardless of what letter is written on it and is not affected by the premium tiles themselves
 haalanki, ek dohare-shabd yaa tihare-shabd varg par isaki niyukti se upyukt premium arjeet kiya jaataa he, us shabd ke liye jisamen use prayog kiya gaya he
 While not part of an official or tournament game, a common "home rule" allows players to "replay" blank tiles for which they later replace the corresponding letter tiles
 ek shabd khilne ke baad, khilaadi apane rack ko saat tilon tak bharne ke liye bag se akshar tiles nikaalte hai
 If there are not enough tiles in the bag to do this, the player takes all the remaining tiles
 ek khilaadi dwaara ek shabd khilne ke baad, unka pratidwandvi khel dwaara bane kisi bhi shabd yaa sabhi shabdon ko chunauti de saktaa he
 If one of the challenged words is found to be unacceptable, the game is removed from the board, the players return the newly played tile to their rack and their turn is forfeited
 toornament khel main, chunauti, kisi ek shabd ke bajaay puure khel main hoti he, isliye ek nirnaayak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or khilaadiyon ko yah pataa nahin chal pata ki kis shabd yaa kin shabdon ke kaaran jeet ke liye chunauti khadi hui
 The penalty for failing an unsuccessful challenge is different from club and tournament games, and they are discussed in more detail below
 uttari america ke niyamon ke anusaar, khel tab samaapt hota he jab ek khilaadi apane rack ke sabhi tilon ko khel chukaa hota he or uske bag kii sabhi tilein khaali ho chuki hoti he ; jab lagaataar chah score rahit chaalen kheli jaati hai or donon ke score shunya-shunya par nahin hote
 When the game ends, each player's score was subtracted from the sum of the digits of the letters played without it
 iske alaava, yadi kisi khilaadi ne apane saare aksharon kaa upyog kar liya he, to duusare khilaadi ke bina khele hue aksharon ke ankon kaa jod bhi uske ankon main jod diya jaataa he; toornament khelon main, ek khaladi jo "baahar nikal jaataa he" is jod kaa doguna jodta he or pratidwandvi par koi jurmaana nahin lagata
 a scoreless move is considered when an invalid word is challenged outside the board, when a player passes his / her move, when a player swaps tiles, or when a word is only cleared from blank tiles
 This final rule differs slightly in international sports
 khel main gathit prayek shabd ke score is tarah se arjeet kiye jate hai: If a player uses seven tiles on a rack in a single game, a bonus of 50 points is added to his game
 yah bonus ank premium varg dwaara prabhavit nahin hote hai
 When the letters are finished to form the word, the final game can often determine the winner
 yah vishesh rup se do se adhik khilaadiyon ke bich kaante kii takkar ke maamalon main dekha jaataa he
 The sum of the points of the tiles played without the player who first gets out of the game is added to the score of the other players
 jin khilaadiyon ke rack par tilein shesh batch jaati hai unke bache hue tilon kaa yoga uske score se ghataya jaataa he
 In some select dictionaries primary entries and their conjugate forms are considered acceptable words
 jin shabdon main hifan, bade akshar, yaa apostrophy vaale shabdon ko istemaal karne kii anumati nahin he, jabatak kii ve sweekaarya pravishtiyon ke rup main bhi drushtigat nahin hote: "jaik " ek vyaktivaachak sangya he, parantu jaik shabd isliye bhi sweekaarya he kyonki uske kai anya upyog bhi hai jo sweekaarya he
 The use of an abbreviation or abbreviation, other than regularized words, is not permitted
 bhinn vartanee, apshabd yaa aakraamak shabd, puraane yaa aprachlit shabd or vishisht shabdaawalee ke shabdon ke prayog ko tabhi anumati di jaati he jab ve sweekaaryata ke anya sabhi mandandon ko puraa karte hai
 Two popular competition word lists are used in different parts of the world: TWL and SOWPODS

 Scrabble plays thousands of clubs and tournaments worldwide
 toornament khelon main khel kii tivrata, shabdon kii anbhigyata or ucch score, kai parlor khilaadiyon ke liye ek aghat ke rup main prakat ho sakati he
 All tournament games are played with a game clock and fixed time controls
 lagbhag sabhi toornament khelon main keval 2 khilaadi shaamil hote he; aam taur par, prayek khilaadi ke paas apane sabhi daav chalane ke liye 25 minute kaa samay hota he
 a player has to pay a penalty of 10 points for passing every minute of time control
 minuton kii sankhya ko purna rup main darshaya jaataa he, taaki agar ek khilaadi do minute or paanch second se samay niyantran ko paar kar jaataa he to dand 30 ank kaa hota he
 In addition, players use special tiles called protiles, which do not have characters engraved on them like wooden tiles, preventing a player from being dishonored by "braille"
 khilaadiyon ko "trekking shit," rakhane kii anumati di jaati he jo praarambhik pool ke saath pehle se hi chape hote hai or jisamen se khele ja chuke tilon ko kaat diya jaataa he
 The most prestigious tournaments include: anya mahatvapurn toornamenton main shaamil hai: Clubs in North America usually meet on one day of the week for three or four hours, for which they have to pay a very low entry fee to cover their expenses and prices

 Tournaments are usually held over the weekend and between six and nine games are played each day

 There are many clubs in the UK and other countries
 antarrashtriya str par nirdhaarit SOWPODS toornamenton kii suchi yahaan pai ja sakati he
 During the holiday hours in the tournament many players reconcile playing consulting scrabble, clabbers, anagrams, bougals and other games
 apane pratidwandiyon ke mukaable adhik se adhik ank arjeet karnaa khel kaa uddeshy he
 The key skill is in knowing which words are acceptable or unacceptable and being able to find words from a pile of cluttered letters
 lagbhag sabhi mahatvapurn toornament khilaadi, shabd soochiyon kaa adhyayan bade paimaane par karte hai or alphagram yaa aniyamit avyavasthit aksharon se shabdon ko sulajhane kaa abhyaas karte hai
 Only a few players know all the acceptable words for international sports
 lekin yah lagbhag nishchit he ki pramukh khilaadi samast shabdon ko to nahin lekin un shabdon ko lagbhag purna rup se jaanate hai jinase unke jivan main rubaru hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 For example, there is no practical advantage in knowing a word like ZYZZYVA, as it requires a highly unlikely rack containing both Y, both blank, one of two Vs, and only Z
 iske vipareet, ATRESIA jaise shabdon ko seekhney or unhen vishwasaneey dhang se khojane kaa mahatvapurn mulya hota he, jisamen ati saamaanya aksharon ke samooh kaa istemaal hota he
 For a beginner club player, the most important list to memorize is 101 or 124 acceptable two-letter words because it allows them to play from word to word parallel to the existing word and more often than not to move or cross a word Offer a chance to earn more points
 adhik gambhir khilaadi isse ek kadam aage le sakate hai or teen aksharon ke sweekrut shabd 1015 yaa 1292 ko bhi yaad karne kii koshish karte hai
 After profiling in two-letter words, beginning players benefit greatly from studying short words as it includes high-score tiles, as well as study of hook lists that determine which words are at the front and back of the word
 Let the letter be denoted, and so it is necessary for the formation of several words in one turn
 march 2006 or OWL2 ke jari hone tak jisamen pehali baar ke liye QI ko ek sweekrut shabd ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya tha or shabdon ko yaad karne ke liye ek mahatvapurn ranneeti banaai gai thi ] he, kuch maamalon main unke paas bina u ke unke rack par ek q he
 The inclusion of q has made q less important without U-, because the probability that a player will have a q without playing will decrease significantly
 Another important tip for beginners is the tactical use of s and spaces, which is more useful for hooks and all tile bonuses
 khel ke uparokt nishchit str main, anguuthe kaa ek acha niyam he jo ki ek s ko pakadaney kaa arth 8 se 10 ank or 25 ank ke upar ek rikt sthaan praapt hoti he
 The word Cwm is quite well-known for a three-letter word with a w of Welsh compared to any of the common English vowels of English - AEIOU and sometimes Y
 anbhavi khilaadi achche rack prabandhan abhyaas ke paksh main ek vyaktigat baari main aksar adhiktam scoring khel se kam kaa chunaav karte hai
 Characters that are worth four or more digits should be played on the premium category if possible, and characters like X, h and y are quite powerful when they can be earned in both directions, which is equal to their face value
 Will be four or six times more
 ek dohare - yaa tihare akshar score ke baad aane vaala ek swar hot spot kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan ek mahatvapurn vyanjan ko kai ankon ke liye shashakt rup se khelaa ja saktaa he
 a good strategy for average players is to memorize all words that contain "power" tiles, such as five letters long or shorter
 in shabdon ke gyaan khilaadi ke scoring ko prati game main 10 se 20 ankon kii vruddhi kar saktaa he yadi unka istemaal thik se kiya jaae
 Rack management is a strategy element that is generally overlooked by most early players
 adhikansh aksharon kii pratilipiyaan rakhana yaa swar or vyanjan ke tilon kii sankhya ke bich ek bada asantulan hona pratikul hota he
 For example, the word with the highest score formed from the letters AADIIKR is DARK
 haalanki, iske baad khilaadi ke paas koi vyanjan nahin bachataa or ek doharaa i bachataa he
 Because vowels are more commonly used in Scrabble, it is entirely possible that the player enters by taking the letters AAIIEUAO in his front turn, for example
 yadi khilaadi ne khilne ke liye RADII - aksharon kaa chayan kiya hota tab vah DARK shabd ke mukaable kam score arjeet karata - or khilaadi ke paas keval a or k akshar batch jate jinka sangyojan aam he
 Expert players who know all four letter words must have played KADI or RAKI to good effect, except one r or one D
 raksha ranneeti kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa he
 Experienced players keep a close watch on how opposing players benefit from their tiles and avoid taking easy tricks
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi khilaadi dwaara banaaya gaya QUIT shabd uske kisi bhi aise pratidwandvi ko 14 ankon kii vruddhi detaa he jiske paas akshar e ho 
 An experienced player will place a consonant next to a bonus square instead of a vowel
 Experienced players will try to place the letter u in an uncomfortable position if the letter q has not been played by that time
 ek baari main sabhi saat tiilon ke istemaal ke liye 50 ank bonus ke kaaran kai khilaadi jitna ho sake utana bingo arjeet karne ke liye apane rack kaa prabandhan karte hai
 Making seven or eight letter words to get high marks faster generally is the way to make seven and eight letter words generally faster to get a higher score
 akshar e, i, main, en, aar, es or tii ke is uddeshy ke liye sabase upyogi akshar hai or isliye ek acha khilaadi ke liye ravaanaa badale main kuch laabh ke bina in patron khilne ke liye anicchhuk hoga
 Conversely, good players try to play off undesirable tiles, even if on time the game will not use a scoring highest available and will use a turn for exchange tiles if necessary
 "LIRI MUMU or jaise swar udaseenta" swar adhik kii rack se ek he ridding main hai upyogi he
 There are some words like INIA, which include vowels and 75% or more
 This is special and important for u to get rid of
 i list words because in North America there are not included three letter words that contain many i, only one and a three letter word which is multiple u
 antarrashtriya shabd suchi kaa upyog player, colins or adhik ke liye kai avaanchit swar ke saath rack ke madhyam se khilne ke vikalp hai
 a good way for intermediate level players to "remember bingo stems," or to form a bingo form group of six letters that combine well with almost any seventh letter
 sarvshereshth bingo he stem karne ke liye he pushtikar joshanda, retina or vyangy ke dwaara peechha kiya
 j or y on the Athletic racket; Will or make a seven letter word are unclear from many of these seven letter words, so it is useful to remember not only the stem, but all possible bingos that can be made with it
 khilaadiyon ko bhi saat patr bingo jaanane ke upji he, jo board par pehle se hi ek aathven patr ke saath gathjod kar sakate hai ho saktaa he
 In order to use both players' mnemonic in the process, both for memorization and speed during play, a specific type is known, including the link below
 ek or ranneeti he ki khilaadiyon ke liye bingos vruddhi upyog karne ke liye ek saath teen se chaar patr sangyojan he ki kai bingos farm rakhana he
 Common examples of these combinations include "IED ing," "ERS", "IES" and "
" An intermediate player is likely to hold on to "ing" at a later time to play bingo at the expense of current points
 "ienji vishesh rup se" bingos karne ke liye aasaan ho khilaadiyon kyonki ve keval chaar aksharon ke bajaay saat punarvyavasthit karne ke liye ek khel khojane kii koshish kii he khojane ke liye jate hai
 Expert players play above two bingo at the highest level, and four bingo by one player in the same game is also not uncommon
 jaise kii kaha ja chukaa he ki toornament str par ek bingo kisi khilaadi ko 50 ank kaa bonus dilaataa he isliye yah dekhte hue ki ek bingo ek 50 sutreey bonus detaa he, pratiyogita ke str par bingo kii sankhya khel main aksar ek nirdhaaran kaarak he
 Competitors are acceptable for words in Scrabble - along with their own "- far hook" at the highest level of knowledge is the most important factor
 scrable visheshgyon ke khel he ki apane virodhiyon ke liye paryaapt avasar pradaan karne ke liye premium varg kaa upyog madhyavarti khilaadiyon, jo or adhik apane virodhiyon ko rokane ke bare main chintit ho jate hai ke vipareet khilne ke liye jate hai
 The desire for defensive strategy is needed as word knowledge increases
 kai khel ke rup main, jab ek khilaadi vah peeche he yaa vah jua or adhik jokhim lene ke liye karne ke liye antar banane kii koshish 20 ank khone ke rup main hona chahie, 40 se khone ke rup main hi he
 The reverse is also true, players who are up front and must play defense
 yah sabit kiya he ek adhyayan ke rup main he ek acha vichaar swayan ke liye "ghaseetna tiles he" ek samay khoj ke liye khilne yogya, shabdon he ki khilaadiyon ko jo shaareerik rup se upyog nahin kar herpher tile jo un shabdon se adhik sambhav ho apane haath utpann karte hai
 Scrabble has been a subject of interest to many artificial intelligence researchers and enthusiasts
 haalanki ek computer khilaadi, sabhi vaid shabdon ke ek database kaa mukt rup se upyog kar saktaa he, ucchtam score ke saath shabdon ko khelnaa, hameshaa sabase acchhee ranneeti nahin hoti he or acha khilne ke liye ek computer ko programing karne ke liye adhik sookshm paddati ke gyaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This game is particularly interesting to implement because it can be broken into two stages, which are - from a computer point of view, radically different
 The first phase runs from the beginning of the game until the last tile is removed from the bag
 During this phase, it is not known what tiles the other player has and there is an element of impropriety in the game
 baharhaal, jab antim tile ko nikaala jaataa he or bag khaali ho jaataa he, to computer samgr akshar vitaran se yah jaankaree nikaal saktaa he ki anya khilaadiyon ke rack par koun se akshar hone chahie
 In particular, when playing against a single opponent, the computer can estimate the exact tiles on the opponent's rack and thus decide what steps may be possible for the rest of the game
 sabase prasiddh AI scrable khilaadi he maven, jise bryan shaperd dwaara banaaya gaya he

 The social networking site Facebook has introduced Scrabulous, an online form of Scrabble, as a third-party additional application

 The original Scrabble now exists on Facebook and was developed by Electronic Arts

 According to official sources, the following records have been achieved during competitive club or sports tournaments, including Joey Adele and John D
 Williams, Jr
 The book written by Everything includes Scrabble and Scrabble FAQ
 jab bhi alag record uplabdh hote hai, unhen vibhinn aadhikarik shabd suchi par aadhaarit alag record main soochibaddh kiya jaataa he: 1) uttari america suchi OSPD yaa OSW, jinka istemaal thailand or israel main kiya jaataa he ; 2) OSW, britain main purv aadhikarik suchi or 3) SOWPODS, sanyukt OSPD + OSW jinka istemaal ab duniya bhar main adhikanshtah kiya jaataa he
 As of now, it is not enough to keep a separate record according to what is considered on the new version or revision of these lists

 He went to the forest for hunting one day
 unke jane ke baad hi unki patni rajaswala ho gai
 He sent this news to the king through his bird of prey
 samachar paakar maharaj sudhanva ne ek done main apana veery nikaal kar pakshi ko de diya
 The bird flew into the sky to bring the two to the king's wife
 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds
 yuddh ke dauraan vah dona pakshi ke panje se chhot kar yamuna main ja gira
 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma
 machhlee rupi apsara done main behate huye veery ko nigal gai tathaa uske prabhaav se vah garbhvatee ho gai
 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net
 nishad ne jab machhlee ko chira to uske pet se ek balak tathaa ek balika nikali
 Nishad went to Maharaj Sudhanwa with those babies
 maharaj sudhanva ke putr na hone ke kaaran unhone balak ko apane paas rakh liya jiskaa naam matsayraj hua
 The girl remained near Nishad and was named Matsyagandha because the smell of fish emitted from her organs
 us kanya ko satyavati ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 When she grew up, she started doing boat work
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on her boat and cross the Yamuna
 parashar muni satyavati rup-soundarya par aasakt ho gayi or bole, "devi! main tumhaare saath sahavaas karnaa chahta hoon
 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl

 According to Hindu scriptures, Maharishi Vyasa was a trikala

 Due to the degeneration of religion, humans will become atheists, dutyless and young
 ek vishaal veda kaa sangopang adhyayan unke samarth se baahar ho jaayegaa
 That is why Maharishi Vyas divided the Vedas into four parts so that even those with less intelligence and less memory could study the Vedas
 vyas ji ne unka naam rakhaa - rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda
 Vyas ji became famous as Ved Vyas because of the division of Vedas
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ko kramshah apane shishy pel, jaimin, vaishampayan or sumantumuni ko padhaayaa
 Veda Vyasa composed the Puranas in the form of the fifth Veda in which the knowledge of Veda is told in the form of interesting stories, because the knowledge contained in Veda is very esoteric and dry
 puraanon ko unhone apane shishy rome harshan ko padhaayaa
 Vyas ji's disciples made many branches and sub-branches of those Vedas according to their own wisdom
 vyas ji ne mahabharat kii rachana kii
 The great Vibhuti of the mythological-epic era, Mahabharata, Eighteen Puranas, Srimadbhagavata, Brahmasutra, Mimamsa, the founder of unique literature-philosophy, Ved Vyas, was born around 3000 BC on Ashada Purnima

 After studying the Vedas, he taught his disciples Sumantu, Jaimini, Pal and Vaishampayan, and his son Shukadeva, and preached the Mahabharata
 aapaki is alokik pratibha ke kaaran aapako bhagwaan kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 Vyasa has become the best poet in Sanskrit literature after Valmiki
