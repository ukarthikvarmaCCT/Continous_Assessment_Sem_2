 But whatever efforts these countries made to establish contact with China from the late thirteenth century to the latter part of the fourteenth century is not of any importance from any point of view
 is samay china main pravisht yatriyon kii sankhya bhi alp hi thi
 But it is so right that from this time the attention of European countries went towards the rich countries of Asia and they started trying to dominate them in the coming centuries
 jab china main ming-shashan prarambh hua, tab in yatriyon ne punah china kii yatra kerani prarambh kii
 At this time also, there were many travel related inconveniences as before
 unheen ke kaaran videshi is kaal main bhi china se ghanishtha sampark kaayam nahin kar sake
 The biggest of these inconveniences was traffic related inconvenience
 china or europea deshon ke madhya abhi bhi vyapaarik sambandh kaayam tha, lekin avaagaman kii in asuvidhaon ke chalate abhi bhi anek vyapaarik kathinaaiyaan uth jaati thim
 All the merchants of Europe and Asia, with their merchant ships, first landed in Lalsagar and crossed it and after that, cruising Egypt, they came and landed in the Mediterranean
 vyapaar karne kaa anya maarg bhi tha
 They began their business journey from the Gulf of Iran
 yatra ke silsile main iraan kii khadi se prasthaan kar basra, baghdad, makka aadi deshon kii yatra karte hue asia miner pahonchte the
 In this way, due to the inconvenience of this traffic, on one hand these merchants could not maintain their economic relations with certain countries, on the other hand they had to waste a lot of time
 vastav main, yahi kaaran tha jiske chalate in dinon purvi deshon ke saath pashchimi desh sambandh kaayam nahin kar sake
 Not only this, in the latter part of the fifteenth century their remaining merchant routes were also blocked
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki 1453 i
 main turk jati kaa ek mahaan vijeta muhamd dwitiya ne kustuntuniya par adhikaar kar liya or unke vyapaarik maarg ko band kar diya
 Nevertheless, these inconveniences also led to the struggle of Western travelers and businessmen and to some extent established relations with China
 mongol shaasha yuan jab tak jivit rahaa tab tak china se videshiyon kaa kuch-na-kuch sampark avashya kaayam rahaa
 But as soon as it died, it seemed that now their mutual relations would end
 lekin ming samraaton ne is sambandh ko purnjivit kiya or pashchimi deshon kii ore unmukh hue
 As time passed, the merchants of western countries could not forget the economic prosperity of the eastern countries
 marcopolo kii diary unke liye prerana-strot hi ban gayi thi faltah pandrahavin sadi ke ant or solahavin sadi ke armbh ke bich in yatriyon kii yatra punah hone lagi or unka vistaar bhi hone laga
 At this time, the Spanish, Dutch and Russian castes helped to advance relations towards the eastern and northern regions of Asia
 spain or portugal ne prerana paakar colombo naamak prasiddh yatri ne bhi yatra kii or sudur purv ke deshon main pahunchne kaa prayaas kiya
 The Portuguese arrived in Macao in 1511 AD and came directly to Chinese soil in 1514 AD
 chiniyon ne in portugaliyon ko asabhy tathaa dukhadaayak mana
 They permanently resided in Macao
 china ke prasiddh bandargah canton ke nikat hi yah makaao avasthit he jahaan aajkal bhi acchhee sankhya main portugali nivas karte hai
 At this time the British also came to China
 jab mig vansh kaa shashan samaapt ho rahaa tha or manchu samraat shashan prarambh hone vaala tha, britain ke angrej china aa dhamke
 He became the most influential in China and received the credit for opening the door of China to trade in Western countries
 in vibhinn jatiyon ke aagaman kaa kramik adhyayan karnaa aavashyak prathit hota he
 In East Asia, the caste that first arrived during the reign of the Ming dynasty was Portuguese
 1498 i
 main vascodigama ne africa ke samudr tateey kshetron kii yatra karte hue bharat-bhoomi par apane pairon ko rakhaa portugal yatri vascodigama ko is yatra se laabh hua ki pashchimi deshon ke logon, ko pradhantah tatkaal main portugijon ko, purvi deshon tak pahunchaane ke maarg kaa pataa lag gaya
 Therefore, his departure and expansion now started in other countries as well
 16 veen sadi ke prarambh main hi malakka par adhikaar karne ke samay ve china pahunch gayi
 He reached China in 1514 AD
 china aate hi ve vyapaarik kaaryon main sanlagn ho gayi
 Traders here started buying luxury items from China and selling them in Western countries where there was a demand for cosmetics
 lekin portuguese apane vyavhaar se chiniyon ko prasann nahin kar sake
 Their behavior and habits were not good, not only were the Portuguese bad, other castes also had similar habits
 spain ke log jab america pahunche tab vahaan kii moulik jatiyon kaa jivan bhi unke chalate atyant kshtprad ho gaya
 The people of Spain did not leave America even after being opposed and built settlements there and settled regularly
 niyamit rup se basate hi ve american logon ke dharm, samskruti rahan-sahan vagairah main hastkshep karne lage
 Not only this, along with the construction of settlements, he also oriented towards colonization; in this connection the Spaniards also reached China
 portugijon ke baad spanish hi china aaye
 The people of China were familiar with the kind of action this caste had done in America
 isliye china kii dharti par upnivesh-nirmaan kaa beej liye jaise hi is jati kaa aagaman hua, vaise hi chiniyon ne inkaa virodh karnaa prarambh kiya
 The Ming government even started a vigorous movement against this caste
 yahi kaaran hua ki america kii tarah china main spain waalon kii daal nahin gal saki
 They could neither maintain their existence in China nor could they build the desired settlements
 portugijon se bhi vyapaarik sambandh kaayam ho gayi the
 This relationship could not be established with them
 phir bhi spanish jidd ke pakke the
 The way they started living forcefully in America, they also tried to stay in China
 inkaa ek jattha china ke prasiddh bandargah canton main thahar gaya or china se vyapaarik sambandh kaayam karne kaa prayaas karne laga
 Finally, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, he succeeded in his work and started to build his settlement in Macao
 isi samay pashchim kii anek dharmik mishnariyaan bhi china aayin
 In China, these missionaries started propagating religion
 prarambh main in mishnariyon ke vyavhaar achche the, lekin baad main unki swarthpurna niti se china ke log parichit hue
 At the same time, the British and Dutch also arrived in China
 lekin yahan yah baat yaad rakhni chahie ki mingvansh ke shashan main china kaa pashchimi deshon se do prakaar ke sambandh kaayam hue-ek vyapaarik sambandh or doosraa dharmik sambandh
 The countries of the west traded the plots of the south with Macao and Canton
 pashchim ke vyapaaree china main apane deshon se anaaj sambandhi anek paudhe tathaa tambaaku laae
 These people promoted tobacco a lot
 inhen ke chalate china ke adhikansh log tambaaku kaa seven karne lage
 Similarly, his religious relationship with China was also maintained
 china ke bhitari ilaakon main pashchimi deshon kii mishnariyaan dharm-prachaar kaa kaary karti thi
 After the Mongols rule, Christians in China had come to an end and their influence began to decline
 lekin mingvansh ke shashan ke antim varshon main roman cathalikon ne in isaayiyon tathaa unki mishnariyon ko punarujjivit kiya
 At the same time, people from xxwrep 4 France, Agustinian, Jusite, Dominion, etc
 many religious sects reached China
 solahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main hi jesuit sampradaay kii pradhanta china main kaayam hone lagi
 The popular promotion of this community was Francis Xavier, who tirelessly and tirelessly tried to popularize this community in South and East Asia
 isi prachaarak ne na is sampradaay kaa prachaar china main bhi kiya
 In fact, the cult was able to survive in China only due to Xavier
 abhi jevisarya ko apane kaary main puri safalataa bhi nahin mili thi ki 1556 i
 main vah sansar se chal basaa
 After his death, the work of his work was carried by Methihar Rikki on his shoulders
 ricki italy kaa nivasee tha
 Rikki's genius was multi-faceted to increase the popularity of the Jesuit community
 vah jyotish tathaa ganit kaa prakand vidwaan tha
 Historians speculate that at present there was no such scholar of astrology and mathematics in China who could equal Rikki
 apane pratibha ke chalate hi usne china sahitya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 This was a completely new subject for Chinese literature Rikki, yet due to his studies and talent, he gained a lot of prestige among Chinese litterateurs
 apane dharm kaa adhyayan to use tha hi, usne canfusius ke dharm tathaa isai dharm kaa kaaphi gaharaa adhyayan kiya or donon dharmon kii samanta tathaa asamanta ko ek vidwaan ke rup main rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 He made his residence in Peking, the capital of China
 isi samay philippine se spanian bhi china aayaa
 By now many Western castes had come into China
 1516 i
 main portuguese aa gayi the, 1575 i
 main spanish aa gayi the; dachon kaa aagaman 1604 i
 main hua tha or angrej 1637 i
 main aaye the
 But by this time the Americans and Russians could not come
 ching shashan-kaal main inkaa aagaman bhi china main ho gaya
 The rule of the Ming dynasty came to an end in 1644 AD
 uttar main manchu naamak vijetaon ne ming ko parrast kiya
 Manchu was a resident of Manchuria
 sohalvin sadi ke uttararddh tathaa satrahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main unhone apane ko shaktishaalee bana liya or ming se mukden apahrit kar liya jo unki rajdhani bhi thi
 They also made Mukden their capital
 china main rahanevaale mongolon ne bhi ichha yaa anichhaa se manchuon ke shashan ko sweekaar kar liya
 The Manchus attempted to extend their state-limits to the southern wall of China
 isi samay jab china main ming ke viruddh asantosh kii bhaavana kaa janm hua tab mauka paakar manchuo ne peking par apana adhikaar kar liya or tabhi se ve china main shashan karne lage
 Kangxi and China Lung were the most powerful kings of this dynasty
 dirghakaal tak manchuo ne china par shashan kiya
 Westerners also came to China in Manchukaal
 agar sach poocha jaay to yah maananaa padegaa ki isi kaal main china main paashchaatya deshon ke prabhaav kii jad jamani prarambh hui or isi kaal main videshon se china kaa vaastavik sambandh kaayam hua
 During this period people from abroad came from both the place and both routes
 samudr ke raste se portuguese, spanish, french tathaa angrej or kuch italian tathaa german aaye
 At the same time, American traders also came to China in 1784 AD
 jameen ke maarg se keval rus ke log aaye jo china main chaandi kaa vyapaar karne lage
 Also signed a treaty with foreign states in China at this time
 is sandhi ke dwaara rus ko peking main ek mishan bhejne kaa adhikaar mila
 Russian missionaries also started working in Peking
 america or rus se yah sambandh china ke liye mahatvapurn siddh hua
 Foreign missionaries also arrived in China at this time
 atharahavin sadi ke china main is samay punah videshi mishnariyon kaa bhi aagaman hua
 By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the number of Christians in China had grown to 300,000
 1793 i
 main sarvapratham angrejon kaa ek mishan china aayaa
 The mission came to China under mccartney's leadership
 doosraa mishan 1816 i
 main peking aayaa
 It was led by Lord Amherst
 isi samay rabart morishan ke adheen bhi ek mishan china pahunchaa
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, now the Protestant missionaries started their work in China
 protestent log chiniyon ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unhen asabhy samajhate the
 Dutch missionaries also visited China and their first mission reached China in 1795 AD
 isi prakaar 1806 i
 main rus kaa ek doot aayaa
 But China did not show any sympathy towards him
 peking main france ke jemuit bhi pahunche or manchu samraat kii gaurav-gaatha gane lage
 Among the various missionaries, the most clever and influential British proved to be the missionaries of the British
 china main aayi vibhinn mishnariyon se agar angrej mishanri kii tulana kii jaay to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki atharahavin sadi ke ant or unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main hi angreji mishanri sabhi se aage nikal gayi
 The reason for this was that the British were very clever and hard-working
 apni vyapaarik kushalta tathaa raajnneeti chaturata ke chalate unhone anya mishnariyon ko pratiyogita main aage nahin badhane diya or bhavishya main china main ve apana prabhaav kaayam karne main samarth hue
 It is clear from the above description that the relationship between China and Western countries was established and by the nineteenth century, many foreigners and their missionaries had become visible all over China
 lekin vah sambandh shantipurvak aage na chal sakaa
 People's government of China gradually began to hate these foreigners and their missionaries
 unka vichaar tha, ki paashchaatya deshon se sampark badhaane par china kii sabhyataa tathaa samskruti nasht ho sakati he, isliye china ne paashchaatya pravritiyon kaa anubhav kiya or unase pruthak rahane kaa prayaas kiya
 Even after coming into contact with Western countries, he adopted his dress, religion and customs
 yahi kaaran tha ki manchu sarkaar khule rup se in paashchaatya deshon se pruthak rahane kaa prayaas karne lagi is baat ko drushti main rakhkar samraat kangehsee ne ek rajkeey vijyapti nikaali or china-pravesh se in jatiyon tathaa mishnariyon ko vanchit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The emperor had his own sentiment behind this communique, but at the same time he had to remove this communion to satisfy the people of China
 china kii janata in videshiyon se ghrinaa karne lagi thi or yah sambhaavna kii jane lagi ki china main khun-kharabi bhi ho sakati he
 There was considerable dissatisfaction in China, especially from foreign missionaries
 ‚Äò‚Äòmishanri ke vibhinn adeshon ke bich jhagade, purvajon kaa aadar karte hue kuch dharm pravartit logon kaa samrat ke hukum kii manyata tathaa saath hi naye dharm kii pravriti ke prati unke afasaron ke pratinidhitiv ke dwaara unki satta kii nunata ne dhire-dhire bhraamak vichaaron ke prachaarak ke vaastavik charitra ke prati unki ankhen khol deen
 But it should be remembered that according to this release, foreigners who came to China were not evacuated from China
 keval un par yaa vibhinn deshon se aaye hue vyapaariyon par ek prakaar kaa niyantran rakhane kii baat kahi gayi
 The Manchu government of China had feared that if these merchants were not allowed to trade, they would try to spread unrest by spreading all over China
 isliye is vijyapti main yah spasht kar diya gaya ki ye videshi vyapaaree china ke sabhi tatavarti bandargahon se shantipurvak uchit vyapaar kar sakate hai
 The happiness of foreigners was not open as soon as they were allowed to do business, because they got this permission in a very easy manner
 isse unka utsaah or hausala donon badha
 As a result, due to lack of meaning, these people also started doing illegal business
 ve un vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa bhi durupyog karne lage jo unhen praapt hue the
 Naturally the attention of the Chinese government was again attracted to him
 isiilie manchu vansh ke duusare samrat chien lug ne 1757 i
 main ek duusari vijyapti nikaali jiske chalate vaideshik vyapaar ko china main simit kar diya gaya or vyapaariyon par anek prakaar ke pratibandh lagaaye gayi
 According to this release, these foreign traders were allowed to trade with only one port of southern China
 iske atirikt china main ek vyapaarik dal kaa sanghathan kiya gaya jise ‚Äòko-hang‚Äô kaha gaya
 Foreign traders could trade with China only under the consultation and supervision of this team
 is tarah atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main un vyapaariyon kii chaal par china kii sarkaar ne ek paini drushti rakhi or yah spasht kar diya ki ve vyapaarik maamalon ke liye kisi anya bandargah kaa daura nahin kar sakate hai
 But this release did not have any special effect on foreign traders
 vyapaar ke saath-saath china kii raajnneeti par bhi inkaa hastkshep hona prarambh ho gaya or isai mishnariyon ke kartrutv to or bhi adhik bure hone lage
 While doing business with Canton, he also started trading with other ports of China
 chiniyon ko opium kaa seven karakar unki aadaten buree banane lage
 Due to the habit of eating opium, traders wanted to get economic benefits by selling opium
 jab opium ke bure parinaamon ko china kii sarkaar dekhne lagi or is vyapaar par roak lagaayi, tab videshi vyapaaree china ke aphisaron ko ghoose dekar apni ore milaane lage or chori chhipe yah vyapaar chalata rahaa
 The British of England were very pathetic in this task
 opium ke chalate china ko do prakaar ke nuksaan hone prarambh ho gayi
 On one hand, the British benefited from increased opium sales, but China had to suffer economic losses
 doosraa yah ki china kii janata kaa naitik dharaatal neeche girane lage
 As a result, the government tried to control the opium trade with full rigor resulting in opium wars in China and Britain
 is yuddh main china safal nahin ho sakaa kyonki uske dushmano ke paas shaktishaalee or kendrit sarkaar thi or china kaa shashan kamjor tathaa vikendrit tha
 Therefore, the Chinese government was weak and decentralized to face these enemies
 atah in shatruon kaa saamana karne ke liye china katai taiyaar nahin tha
 '' is tarah anek varshon ke baad unnisvin sadi tak china ke saath videshiyon kaa sambandh kaayam hua
 The consequences of this relationship proved extremely bad for the Chinese
 yah sahi he ki inhen videshiyon ke chalate china main rashtriyata kii bhaavana aayi, lekin jabatak videshiyon kii daal galati rahi ve china main apane samrajyavad ke vikaas kaa pratyan karte rahe
 Indian historian Mr
 Pannikar is of the view that China suffered more from the benefits of contact with Western countries and after five-six years of the First World War, the pride of China kept getting dusty, political integrity kept breaking and administrative persistence Could not be brought yuddh kala main madhya asian deshon se aage nikal jane ke kaaran china ne madhya asia par apana prabhutv jamaa liya, par saath hi saath vah europea shaktiyon ke samaksh kamjor padane laga

 After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China became politically fragmented, albeit a recognized but genuinely powerless government set up in Beijing by the international community

 Kuomintang was founded in the last years of 1920 by Chiang Kai-shek who reintegrated China and declared the nation's capital as Nanking and implemented a "political patronage" determined by Sun Yat-sen for China's political development The intermediate star of the program undertaken was to make China a modern and democratic nation
