 But whatever efforts these countries made to establish contact with China from the late thirteenth century to the latter part of the fourteenth century is not of any importance from any point of view
 is samay china main pravisht yatriyon kii sankhya bhi alp hi thi
 But it is so right that from this time the attention of European countries went towards the rich countries of Asia and they started trying to dominate them in the coming centuries
 jab china main ming-shashan prarambh hua, tab in yatriyon ne punah china kii yatra kerani prarambh kii
 At this time also, there were many travel related inconveniences as before
 unheen ke kaaran videshi is kaal main bhi china se ghanishtha sampark kaayam nahin kar sake
 The biggest of these inconveniences was traffic related inconvenience
 china or europea deshon ke madhya abhi bhi vyapaarik sambandh kaayam tha, lekin avaagaman kii in asuvidhaon ke chalate abhi bhi anek vyapaarik kathinaaiyaan uth jaati thim
 All the merchants of Europe and Asia, with their merchant ships, first landed in Lalsagar and crossed it and after that, cruising Egypt, they came and landed in the Mediterranean
 vyapaar karne kaa anya maarg bhi tha
 They began their business journey from the Gulf of Iran
 yatra ke silsile main iraan kii khadi se prasthaan kar basra, baghdad, makka aadi deshon kii yatra karte hue asia miner pahonchte the
 In this way, due to the inconvenience of this traffic, on one hand these merchants could not maintain their economic relations with certain countries, on the other hand they had to waste a lot of time
 vastav main, yahi kaaran tha jiske chalate in dinon purvi deshon ke saath pashchimi desh sambandh kaayam nahin kar sake
 Not only this, in the latter part of the fifteenth century their remaining merchant routes were also blocked
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki 1453 i
 main turk jati kaa ek mahaan vijeta muhamd dwitiya ne kustuntuniya par adhikaar kar liya or unke vyapaarik maarg ko band kar diya
 Nevertheless, these inconveniences also led to the struggle of Western travelers and businessmen and to some extent established relations with China

 But as soon as it died, it seemed that now their mutual relations would end

 Not only this, along with the construction of settlements, he also oriented towards colonization; in this connection the Spaniards also reached China

 The people of China were familiar with the kind of action this caste had done in America
 isliye china kii dharti par upnivesh-nirmaan kaa beej liye jaise hi is jati kaa aagaman hua, vaise hi chiniyon ne inkaa virodh karnaa prarambh kiya
 The Ming government even started a vigorous movement against this caste

 They could neither maintain their existence in China nor could they build the desired settlements

 This relationship could not be established with them

 In China, these missionaries started propagating religion

 At the same time, the British and Dutch also arrived in China

 The popular promotion of this community was Francis Xavier, who tirelessly and tirelessly tried to popularize this community in South and East Asia

 They also made Mukden their capital
 china main rahanevaale mongolon ne bhi ichha yaa anichhaa se manchuon ke shashan ko sweekaar kar liya
 The Manchus attempted to extend their state-limits to the southern wall of China
 isi samay jab china main ming ke viruddh asantosh kii bhaavana kaa janm hua tab mauka paakar manchuo ne peking par apana adhikaar kar liya or tabhi se ve china main shashan karne lage
 Kangxi and China Lung were the most powerful kings of this dynasty
 dirghakaal tak manchuo ne china par shashan kiya
 Westerners also came to China in Manchukaal
 agar sach poocha jaay to yah maananaa padegaa ki isi kaal main china main paashchaatya deshon ke prabhaav kii jad jamani prarambh hui or isi kaal main videshon se china kaa vaastavik sambandh kaayam hua
 During this period people from abroad came from both the place and both routes
 samudr ke raste se portuguese, spanish, french tathaa angrej or kuch italian tathaa german aaye
 At the same time, American traders also came to China in 1784 AD
 jameen ke maarg se keval rus ke log aaye jo china main chaandi kaa vyapaar karne lage
 Also signed a treaty with foreign states in China at this time

 Foreign missionaries also arrived in China at this time

 Taking advantage of this opportunity, now the Protestant missionaries started their work in China

 Dutch missionaries also visited China and their first mission reached China in 1795 AD

 Among the various missionaries, the most clever and influential British proved to be the missionaries of the British
 china main aayi vibhinn mishnariyon se agar angrej mishanri kii tulana kii jaay to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki atharahavin sadi ke ant or unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main hi angreji mishanri sabhi se aage nikal gayi
 The reason for this was that the British were very clever and hard-working
 apni vyapaarik kushalta tathaa raajnneeti chaturata ke chalate unhone anya mishnariyon ko pratiyogita main aage nahin badhane diya or bhavishya main china main ve apana prabhaav kaayam karne main samarth hue
 It is clear from the above description that the relationship between China and Western countries was established and by the nineteenth century, many foreigners and their missionaries had become visible all over China
 lekin vah sambandh shantipurvak aage na chal sakaa
 People's government of China gradually began to hate these foreigners and their missionaries
 unka vichaar tha, ki paashchaatya deshon se sampark badhaane par china kii sabhyataa tathaa samskruti nasht ho sakati he, isliye china ne paashchaatya pravritiyon kaa anubhav kiya or unase pruthak rahane kaa prayaas kiya
 Even after coming into contact with Western countries, he adopted his dress, religion and customs
 yahi kaaran tha ki manchu sarkaar khule rup se in paashchaatya deshon se pruthak rahane kaa prayaas karne lagi is baat ko drushti main rakhkar samraat kangehsee ne ek rajkeey vijyapti nikaali or china-pravesh se in jatiyon tathaa mishnariyon ko vanchit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The emperor had his own sentiment behind this communique, but at the same time he had to remove this communion to satisfy the people of China
 china kii janata in videshiyon se ghrinaa karne lagi thi or yah sambhaavna kii jane lagi ki china main khun-kharabi bhi ho sakati he
 There was considerable dissatisfaction in China, especially from foreign missionaries
 ‘‘mishanri ke vibhinn adeshon ke bich jhagade, purvajon kaa aadar karte hue kuch dharm pravartit logon kaa samrat ke hukum kii manyata tathaa saath hi naye dharm kii pravriti ke prati unke afasaron ke pratinidhitiv ke dwaara unki satta kii nunata ne dhire-dhire bhraamak vichaaron ke prachaarak ke vaastavik charitra ke prati unki ankhen khol deen
 But it should be remembered that according to this release, foreigners who came to China were not evacuated from China
 keval un par yaa vibhinn deshon se aaye hue vyapaariyon par ek prakaar kaa niyantran rakhane kii baat kahi gayi
 The Manchu government of China had feared that if these merchants were not allowed to trade, they would try to spread unrest by spreading all over China
 isliye is vijyapti main yah spasht kar diya gaya ki ye videshi vyapaaree china ke sabhi tatavarti bandargahon se shantipurvak uchit vyapaar kar sakate hai
 The happiness of foreigners was not open as soon as they were allowed to do business, because they got this permission in a very easy manner
 isse unka utsaah or hausala donon badha
 As a result, due to lack of meaning, these people also started doing illegal business
 ve un vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa bhi durupyog karne lage jo unhen praapt hue the
 Naturally the attention of the Chinese government was again attracted to him
 isiilie manchu vansh ke duusare samrat chien lug ne 1757 i
 main ek duusari vijyapti nikaali jiske chalate vaideshik vyapaar ko china main simit kar diya gaya or vyapaariyon par anek prakaar ke pratibandh lagaaye gayi
 According to this release, these foreign traders were allowed to trade with only one port of southern China
 iske atirikt china main ek vyapaarik dal kaa sanghathan kiya gaya jise ‘ko-hang’ kaha gaya
 Foreign traders could trade with China only under the consultation and supervision of this team
 is tarah atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main un vyapaariyon kii chaal par china kii sarkaar ne ek paini drushti rakhi or yah spasht kar diya ki ve vyapaarik maamalon ke liye kisi anya bandargah kaa daura nahin kar sakate hai
 But this release did not have any special effect on foreign traders
 vyapaar ke saath-saath china kii raajnneeti par bhi inkaa hastkshep hona prarambh ho gaya or isai mishnariyon ke kartrutv to or bhi adhik bure hone lage
 While doing business with Canton, he also started trading with other ports of China
 chiniyon ko opium kaa seven karakar unki aadaten buree banane lage
 Due to the habit of eating opium, traders wanted to get economic benefits by selling opium
 jab opium ke bure parinaamon ko china kii sarkaar dekhne lagi or is vyapaar par roak lagaayi, tab videshi vyapaaree china ke aphisaron ko ghoose dekar apni ore milaane lage or chori chhipe yah vyapaar chalata rahaa
 The British of England were very pathetic in this task
 opium ke chalate china ko do prakaar ke nuksaan hone prarambh ho gayi
 On one hand, the British benefited from increased opium sales, but China had to suffer economic losses
 doosraa yah ki china kii janata kaa naitik dharaatal neeche girane lage
 As a result, the government tried to control the opium trade with full rigor resulting in opium wars in China and Britain
 is yuddh main china safal nahin ho sakaa kyonki uske dushmano ke paas shaktishaalee or kendrit sarkaar thi or china kaa shashan kamjor tathaa vikendrit tha
 Therefore, the Chinese government was weak and decentralized to face these enemies
 atah in shatruon kaa saamana karne ke liye china katai taiyaar nahin tha

 The consequences of this relationship proved extremely bad for the Chinese
