 It was during these days that he read Tolstoy's compositions and was attracted to them

 Suddenly in 1910, he decided to abandon his ancestral village "yasnaya Polyana" forever
 10 navambar 1910 ko apni putree eleclandra ke saath unhonen prasthaan kiya, par 22 navbanr 1910 ko maarg ke stesan astapovo main aksmaat fefde main dah hone se vahiin unka sharirant ho gaya

 They considered a purposeless, thoughtless and autistic life as a kind of sin; Even he considered sexual intercourse only for the purpose of procreation

 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he

 Work on the ULAN began in 1984, when the Getty decided to merge and coordinate controlled vocabulary resources for use by the J
 Paul Getty Trust's many automated documentation projects
 The Art and Architecture Thesaurus was already being managed by the Getty at this time, and the Getty attempted to respond to requests from Getty projects for additional controlled vocabularies for artists' names and geographic names 
 In 1987 the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology
 The ULAN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program
 Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval
 The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community
 Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized "union list" of clustered artist names and biographies, In order to make it consistent with the AAT and Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international standards for thesaurus construction
 Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels
 The ULAN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink 
 The ULAN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers
 The ULAN was published in 1994 in hardcopy and machine-readable files
 Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the ULAN, by 1997 it had become evident that hard-copy publication was impractical
 It is now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing
 The data for ULAN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats
 Final editorial control of the ULAN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules
 The current managers of the ULAN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management
 The ULAN is a structured vocabulary containing around 120,000 records, including 293,000 names and biographical and bibliographic information about artists and architects, including a wealth of variant names, pseudonyms, and language variants
 Even though the structure is relatively flat, the ULAN is constructed as a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the ULAN hierarchies ; it currently has two published facets: Person and Corporate Body
 Entities in the Person facet typically have no children
 Entities in the Corporate Body facet may branch into trees
 There may be multiple broader contexts, making the ULAN structure polyhierarchical
 In addition to the hierarchical relationships, the ULAN also has equivalent and associative relationships

 According to a legend described in the Vishnupurana, the demons had two sons, Adyapurusha Kashyapa and his wife Diti
 hiranyakashiphu or hiranyaksh
 Hiranyakashipu pleased Brahma by hard penance and received the boon that he would not be killed by any human nor animal, nor be killed in day nor night, nor indoors, nor by the use of any weapon
 And his life will not be afraid due to the attack of any weapon
 is vardaan ne use ahamkaari bana diya or vah apane ko amar samajhane laga
 He seized the kingdom of Indra and started harassing the three worlds
 vah chahta tha ki sab log use hi bhagwaan maane or uski puja karen
 He prohibited the worship of Vishnu in his kingdom
 hiranyakashiphu kaa putr prahlaad, bhagwaan vishnu kaa upaask tha or yatnaa evam pratadna ke baavjood vah vishnu kii puja karata rahaa
 Enraged, Hiranyakashipu asked his sister Holika to go into the burning fire with Prahlad on her lap as Holika had a boon that she would not burn in the fire
 jab holikaa ne prahlaad ko lekar agni main pravesh kiya to prahlaad kaa bal bhi bankaa na hua par holikaa jalakar raakh ho gai
 In the last attempt Hiranyakashipu heated an iron pillar and turned red and asked Prahlad to embrace it
 ek baar phir bhagwaan vishnu prahlaad ko ubaarane aae
 They appeared as Narasimha from the pillar and placed Hiranyakashipu at the entrance of the palace, which was neither outside the house nor inside, at dusk, when there was neither day nor night, half man, half animal which was neither male nor animal
 Such as Narasimha killed with his long sharp nails, which were neither weapons nor weapons

 kuch sthanon par use hiranyakashyap kaha gaya he or kuch sthanon par hiranyakashiphu
 It is believed that he was named Hiranyakashipu at the time of birth but due to persecution he was later known as Hiranyakashipu

 In mammals and birds, sleep is divided into two main parts: fast eye movements and non-fast eye movements
 Each type is associated with a different set of physical, neurological and psychological characteristics
 american academy of sleep medicine ne NREM ko or bhi teen staron main vibhajit kiya he: N1, N2 or N3
 antim str ko delta sleep yaa slo-wave sleep bhi kehete hai
 Sleep proceeds in the cycle of REM and NREM, the sequence being normally N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM
 raat main aarambh main bahut adhik gahari neend hua karti he, jabaki raat main baad main or prakritik jaagran se thik pehle REM neend kaa anupaat bad jaataa he
 The stages of sleep were first described by Alfred Lee Loomis and his colleagues in 1937; Who divided the various electroencephalography characteristics of sleep into five levels, which represent the order from waking to deep sleep
 1953 main, REM nidra ke bhinn rup kii khoj kii gayi or is prakaar wiliam dement or nathanial clitman ne nidra ko NREM charnon tathaa REM main punarvargeekrut kiya
 In 1968, in "R&K Sleep Scoring Manual" Alan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales standardized the criteria for stages
 aar and ke maanak main, NREM nidra ko chaar charnon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha, dhimi-tarangon kii nidra charnon ko charan 3 or 4 rakhaa gaya
 In Phase 3, delta waves are less than 50% of the total wave pattern, while in Phase 4 they exceed 50%
 iske alaava, REM nidra kaa ullekh kabhi-kabhi charan 5 ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 In 2004, AASM appointed the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R&K scoring system
 samiksha se kai badlaav kiye gayi, inamen sabase mahatvapurn rahaa charan 3 or charan 4 kaa charan N3 main sangyojan

 Stimulus and breathing, cardiovascular and motion episodes were also added
 visheshikrut nidra prayogshaala main polisomnography dwaara neend ke charan tathaa neend kii anya visheshtaon kaa aam taur par moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 Measurements taken include EEG of brain waves, electroculography of eye movements and electromyography of skeletal muscle activity
 manushyon main, prayek nidra chakra ausat 90 se 110 minute tak ke liye rahata he, or prayek charan ke alag-alag shaareerik kaary ho sakate hai
 This may cause sleepiness and may cause unconsciousness, but it does not complete physical work
 2007 ke eeesem maanakon ke anusaar, enariem teen charnon ke hote hai
 NREM has relatively few dreams
 charan N1 mastishk ke sankraman se sambandhit he, is charan main mastishk 8 se 13 hertz kii frequency ke alpha tarangon se 4 se 7 hertz frequency kii theta tarangon main sankraman karata he
 This phase is sometimes referred to as drowsiness or sound sleep
 achaanak jhatka aana or neend ke ubharne ko sakaaratmak myochlonus ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, jo N1 ke dauraan neend ke aarambh ke saath judaa ho saktaa he
 Some people may also have hypnotic hallucinations during this phase, which can be troublesome for them
 N1 ke dauraan, vyakti kuch mansapeshi dasha or bahari vaataavaran kii sabase adhik sachet jaagrukta ganvaa detaa he
 The characteristic of phase N2 is that during this time the sleep spindle rotates between 11 and 16 Hz and K-complexes
 is charan ke dauraan, jaisaa ki EMG dwaara mapa gaya, mansapeshiyon kii gatividhi kam ho jaati he or bahari vaataavaran ke prati sachet jaagrukta gaayab ho jaati he
 In adults, this stage occurs in 45% to 55% of total sleep
 stage N3 kaa charitra chithran is tarah kiya jaataa he ki is dauraan delta tarangon kaa kam se kam 20% 0
5 se 2 hertz ke bich hon or chotii-se-chotii aayam >75 μv kaa ho
 Parasomnians like night terror, night bed, walking in sleep and sleep disturbances occur in this phase
 kai drushtaant or vivaran abhi bhi 20% -50% delta tarangon ke saath N3 charan or 50% se adhik delta tarangon ke saath N4 ko darshaate hai; ye sanyukt rup se charan N3 hai
 Fast eye movement sleep, or REM sleep, accounts for 20% –25% of the total sleep of most human adults
 aariem nidra ke liye mandandon main tej netra gati or ek drut kam-voltage iiji shaamil he
 The most memorable dreams come at this stage
 kam se kam stanadhariyon main, ek avarohi mansapeshi tanaav dekha gaya he
 This type of paralysis may be necessary to protect the anatomy from self-harm, which may occur through physical activity from the living dreams often encountered during this phase
 neend kaa samay sirkadian ghadi, sleep-vek homeostasis dwaara niyantrit he or manushyon main, kuch seemaa ke andar, ichhashakti vyavhaar par nirbhar he
 The circadian clock — an internal timekeeping, temperature-instability, enzyme-controlling device — works in tandem with adenosine, a neurotransmitter that disrupts many physiological processes associated with wakefulness
 adenosine din bhar main taiyaar hota he; adenosine ke ucch str se tandra aati he
 In diurnal animals, sleepiness or drowsiness comes from the circadian element due to the release of the hormone melatonin and the gradual decrease in the body's internal temperature
 kisiike kronotip dwaara samay prabhavit hota he
 Circadian rotation determines the ideal timing of a properly structured and healthy sleeping episode
