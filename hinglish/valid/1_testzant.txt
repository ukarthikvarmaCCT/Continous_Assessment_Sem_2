 The dry air in the lower atmosphere consists of a mixture of several gases, mainly nitrogen 78 percent, oxygen 21 percent, argon 0
93 percent and carbon dioxide 0
03 percent
 in gaison ke atirikt kuch anya gaisen bhi hoti hai, jaise hydrogen tathaa ozone
 The mixing of dry air by continuous mixing of the lower atmosphere by winds and by vertical convection is so irreversible that the atomic mass of the dry air remains constant at 28
96 for at least 20 km altitude; That is, the density of air is 1
276 3 grams per cubic cent
 Occurs when the air pressure is 1,000 millibars and the temperature is 0 ° C

 The discovery of Dobson has shown that there is a close correlation between the pressure at 10 km altitude and the amount of ozone
 vayumandal main keval jalawaashp hi aisa avyav he jisaki bhautik avasthaa kaa parivartan saamaanya vayumandaleey paristhitiyon main hota rahata he
 Therefore, the percentage volume of water vapor in the atmosphere keeps increasing greatly
 vayumandal main jalawaashp kaa ghatana badhanaa rituvigyaan ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 Evaporation and condensation of water is important not only because they transport water from one place to another, but also because evaporation of water requires absorption of latent heat

 The air pressure of any place is generated by the weight of the air above it, so the difference between the pressures of two different heights is equal to the weight of the unit's transverse section of air between these two heights
 yadi yah daab kaa antar bich kii hawa ke bhaar se yatharth rup main santulit na ho to us vayustar ko upar kii ore yaa neeche kii ore twaran praapt hota he
 The situation in which the pressure difference and air load are balanced, or that there is no vertical acceleration other than gravity acceleration, is called a situation of hydrostatic equilibrium
 yah paristhiti kisi bhi str par oonchaai ke saath dabaparivartan kii dar kaa parichay detii he
 If there is a pressure difference between two pressures and there is a vertical distance between two levels, density and accelerated gravity, then is sameekaran ko dravasthaitik sameekaran kehete hai
 Gravitational acceleration decreases only slightly due to different latitudes and altitudes, but due to pressure, heat, and moisture, the density of air decreases in greater quantity
 isliye vayumandal main urdhwadhar dabpravanta atyant parivartansheel hoti he
 Two formulas are used to calculate pressure under 68 km
 pehle sutara kaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he jab maanak taapmaana lesp dar shunya na ho
 Others are used when the standard heat lapse rate is zero
 pehla sameekaran: Second equation: jahaan Or converted to English units: jahaan The normative method of measuring height is that by measuring the pressure and temperature by the formula given above, the difference of altitude is obtained and if the accuracy is required, the amount of humidity can also be used

 This quantity is called solar constant
 saura niyatank ke maan main pai gai aniyamit ghat bad ek pratishat se bhi kam rahati hai; ye prekshantrutiyon ke kaaran ho sakati hai
 In addition to these irregular highs , a real and large ejaculation has also been found, which can be even longer in the eleven-year sun-stigma cycle by about a percentage
 parantu ye sab ucchavachan itane laghu hai ki vayumandaleey ushm santulan ke sambandh main yah maan liya ja saktaa he ki prithvi par saura urja 1

 It is estimated that 43 percent of the solar energy is reflected and scattered and the combined power of scattering is called albedo
 yah 43 pratishat he
 The remaining 57 percent of the energy, which is effective insolation, provides an average of 57 heat units to the surface and atmosphere

 The reason for evaporation and condensation in the atmosphere is the decrease in the ability of the air to absorb water vapor, that is, hot or cold air
 saadhaarant: vayumandal main jalawaashp-maatra santrupt maatra se kam hoti he, visheshkar bhootal ke sameep jahaan vayumandal kaa prabhavakaari aatapan adhiktam hota he
 Much of the moisture in the air, which keeps the water cycle running in the atmosphere, is obtained by evaporation
 jaise-jaise jal vashpit hota he, taise taise vah vayumandal main visarit hota rahata he
 The seasonal actions by evaporation in the atmosphere are not relatively significant
 drishy bhaap kii uttapati bhi vaashpan dwaara honevaali mausami kriya he
 Very cold or relatively cold humid air becomes highly saturated due to the rapid evaporation of hot water from the surface
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki drishy bhaap ke rup main nami kaa turant sanghanan ho jaataa he jiske kaaran sthir hawa main ghanaa koharaa ban jaataa he
 Condensation occurs on an open surface when the temperature of that surface is lower than the temperature of the surrounding air's dew point
 is prakaar ke sanghanan ke udhaaharan garam mausam main paae jate hai
 For example, even though the relative humidity of air is sufficiently below 100 percent, the vapor of the air condenses outside a glass filled with ice water
 Similarly, on a clean Pacific night, the condensation of dew occurs on those ground objects Radiation cools to lower temperatures due to the dew of the surrounding air, frost settles on surfaces that are cooler than freezing, even if free Why should the temperature of the air be much higher than the freezing point? jab vayumandal ke bheetar chote chhot jalbinduon ke rup main sanghanan hota he to prashn yah uthta he ki yah prakram kis prakaar prarambh hota he
 Experimentation has proved that condensation does not occur as a burning point in completely insoluble air, even if the vapor pressure in it is ten times the saturation pressure
 prathit hota he ki jalawaashp kaa sanghanan prarambh karne ke liye kisi prakaar ke kanon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo shuddh vaayu main upasthit nahin hote
 This type of particle is called condensation nucleus
 pareekshan se gyaat hua he ki vaayu main jalaakarshi padaarthon ke nanhen kan, jaise samudri namak ke kan, sanghanan nabhikon kaa kaary karte hai
 In places where the smoke of factories contaminates the atmosphere, small particles of oxides of substances such as smoke sulfur, phosphorus, etc
 become condensation nuclei
 saadhaarant: nichle kshobhamandal ke kuhare or badalon main prati ghan centimetre sau se das hajaar tak nanhen jalbindu hote hai
 The topic of how clouds or second precipitation forms are formed in the clouds is still a matter of doubt
 kadachit ye bahut se chote-chote meghkanon ke sangyojan dwaara banate hai
 The combination would be caused by the mixing of air currents and the rise of air

 Monsoon is called Pavas in Hindi
 bumadhyarekha ke sameep taap ke ritujanit parivartan saamanyat: pawas ke vikaas ke liye bahut chote hote hai
 At high latitudes, where the westerly wind moves, and in polar regions, the gusts formed by the variation of land and sea heat are only able to slightly alter Earthwide wind communications
 aisi paristhiti main pawas ke vikaas ke liye sabase adhik anukool pradesh ushnavalay ke sameep madhya akshanshon main hote hai
 The amount of humidity present in the winds running towards the site and the design of the site have a great influence on the rainfall

 Around 30 crores arab log yaa arabi log ek maanav jatiyon kaa samooh he jo mukhya rup se pashchimi asia or uttar africa main rahete hai
 The Arab people are primarily associated with the Arabic language and culture although historically the definition of 'arab' has changed
 kuch kaalon main yah shabd keval badu logon ke liye prayog hua he jabaki anya kaalon main barbar log bhi isamen shaamil rahen hai
 If the most detailed definition of 'arab people' is taken, then their population is more than 300 million and according to some sources, this Han Chinese is the second largest human race in the world
 'arab' naam ke strot or arth ko lekar vidwaanon main vivaad he
 It is first of all found in an Akkadi language inscription of the 9th century BC which describes the Assyrian Empire occupying Syria after the 'karkar War'
 isamen asyria ke raja shalmanser tritiy kii faujon dwaara luti chizon main 'gindbu arab ke 1000 oont' bhi shaamil hai
 This Gindabu was the chieftain of the Arab faction in the Allies fighting against the Assyrians in this war
 'arab' naam kii utpatti kii sabase lokapriya kahani yah he ki yah ek 'yarab' naamak aadmi se aayaa he jo arabi bhashaa bolne vaala pehla vyakti tha
 al-hamdani, the ancient Arab intellectual, had a different opinion
 unka kahana tha ki kyonki arab log mesopotamia se pashchim main basate the, isliye unke liye 'garab' shabd istemaal hone laga, jiskaa arth arabi or anya sthaneey bhashaaon main 'pashchim' hota he
 This deteriorated into 'arab'
 ek anya pracheen arab itihaaskaar, al-masudi, kaa kahana tha ki shuru main yah naam 'arabah vaadi' ke nivaasiyon ke liye tha jo vistrut hokar puri jati ke liye prayog hone laga
 Although many people consider Arab identity to be the same as Muslim identity, in reality it is two different things
 bahut se arab isai hote hai or kuch yahudee bhi hote hai
 In present times 7% to 10% of the Arab people are followers of Christianity

 holocost samooche yahudee logon ko jad se khatm kar dene kaa sochaa-samajha or yojanabaddh prayaas tha
 In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and established a racist empire, in which Jews were labeled sub-human and were not considered part of the human race
 1939 main germany dwaara vishwa yuddh bhadakaane ke baad hitler ne yahudiyon ko jad se mitaane ke liye apane antim hal ko amal main laana shuru kiya
 His soldiers began to squeeze the Jews into certain areas
 unase kaam karwaane, unhen ek jagah ikattha karne or maar daalane ke liye vishesh camp sthapit kiye gaye, jinamein sabase kukhyat tha oschvitz
 Jews were brought to these camps and killed in the closed rooms, leaving poisonous gas
 jinhen kaam karne ke kaabil nahin samajha jaataa, unhen maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa, jabaki baaki bache yahudiyon main se zyaadaatar bhukh or beemaari se dam tod dete
 Documents revealed after the war reveal that Hitler's motive was to eliminate every single Jew from the world
 yuddh ke chah saal ke dauraan naajiyon ne takreeban 60 lakh yahudiyon kii hatya kar di, jinamein 15 lakh bachche the
 Hitler carried out his objective of eradicating Jews so effectively that one-third of the world's Jewish population was destroyed
 yah narsanhaar sankhya, prabandhan or kriyanvayan ke lihaaj se vilakshan tha
 Under this, people of a community started being killed wherever they met, simply because they were born Jewish
 in kaarnon ke chalate hi ise apni tarah kaa naam diya gaya-holocost
 Several answers have been offered to this question: religious, historical, philosophical, psychological, and Marxist
 lekin koi bhi ek jawaab kabhi santoshjanak nahin ho saktaa
 The historical answer goes like this - In the 1930s a large part of the German population agreed to live in a society that was based on hatred, the concept of ethnic superiority and violence
 ve jis vyavastha se bandhe the, uski kendriya dharna yah thi ki yahudee log har us cheez kii numaaindgi karte hai, jo germanon ke khilaaf he or isliye yahudiyon ko khatm kar diya janaa chahie
 This notion was also associated with a racialized view of the world, which considered the Germans to be part of the master race and the Jews as having an anti race with destructive physical qualities
 jab yahudiyon kaa bhugolic rup se khaatmaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa, tab unhone sabase kattar rasta akhriyaar kiya, jo tha- antim hal
 More such incidents are found in history, but some things of the Holocaust make it unique
 naaji germany ke alaava bhi kai sarkaron ne camp system or technolji kaa sahaara liya or itihaas ke zyaadaatar hisse main yahudiyon kaa katl kiya jaataa rahaa
 But the Holocaust can be said to be different for two main reasons
 1
 duusare samoohon ke prati apni nitiyon se alag naajiyon ne har yahudee ko maarane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 For this, they did not care about age, sex, faith or work
 unhone is makasad ko anjaam dene ke liye khaas taur par ek aadhunik naukarshahi kaa istemaal kiya
 2
 The Nazi leadership said that eradicating Jews from the world would be beneficial for the German people and the whole of humanity
 haalanki asal main yahudiyon kii ore se unhen koi khatra nahin tha
