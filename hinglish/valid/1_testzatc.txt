 And the people who have denied our verses, they go into the darkness and leave the deaf god whom they want, and whoever they want, put them on the straight line, ask if you understand that if you have a miracle in front of you, or Doom is present in front of you, so if you are true, then you will call yourself, except yourself, but you will call on it, if you want to, for whom You have called him, and you will forget him, and you will forget the other people whom you believed and you have already passed the many passions to him, then we have arrested him in a lot of trouble and trouble so that he When people pleaded, why did not those people beg for their surprise, but their hearts were hardened, and their prisoners got paid Sector was shown to embellish and that was them advice so when he forgot we have But opened the doors of all kinds of blessings, even those who were given to them, when they were happy to find them, then we took them to Naga, then at that time they remained hopeless, then the root of the Zalim people was cut off and the owners of all the places Ask God if you think that if God takes your ears and your eyes and stamps on your heart, then who else but God exists It is those who give you these names, then how do we make our arguments, but even then, those people are turned to face and ask them if you understand that if the goodness of God on your head comes in the knowledge or information
 Will other people except the criminals be disgraced and we only send the Rasools out of desperation to give the good news and scare then the one who confessed Imaan and did good things a so will not be any Khuf or she Ghmghin the people and those who If we defied our verses, because they used to be manipulative, they would turn over

 Ask them, who do you get rid of the tears of happiness and kindness, so that you ask that if he bumps and praises If we get rid of him, we will surely pass his lines, you say to him and in every case, God gives you away, even after that you go on asking you He is the one who controls it so well that if you are exposed to you, or you are under your feet or fighting one gang against the other, and some of you should enjoy the battle of hawk men
 How do we tell our verses in reverse, so that people will understand and your law has denied them, although it is time to tell them that i owe you something Undertaking is not fixed a specific time every news and Ankhrib ye shall know And when you look at those people who are making frivolous arguments in our verses, then avoid them, even those people start arguing in something other than that and if you forget the truth then after remembering with the oppressed people Do not sit at all and answer such people, not on some spartan but to remind them so that these people also become spartan and those who have kept their humble game and spectacle and the world's life Life has kept them under deception and leave such people and through the Quran, they will be tried by the Qur'an, if they get raped by their actions, they will not have any patron or support except God, Even if we give revenge, one of them will not be taken

 And the day it says that it is done, its attitude is true and the day the sun will be blown out, it will be the ruler of the missing person and the same grain of speech Land Recall the time) when Abraham said to his father Ajhr you veils i think of you as God - i see you and your demons in open gullibility or not) In the same way, we continued to show Abraham the whole sky and the sultanate of the land so that it would be with those who believe it, when the night was praised on them

 He made the night and the sun and the moon for the account
 These Gods are the carved characters of Ghalib and Dana and he is the one who created stars for you so that you Know the path of mistakes and lines to those who are real, for those who are real, we have made a very good statement and that God is the one who created you from a person and then the place of agreement) and the place of handing is ready For the wise people, we have made a statement with great effect and the one who rained water from the sky, then through him we extracted everything from it
 Then we took out green twigs from him that we could get the pimples Take out and produce bunches hanging from the date of the date of the date of the date and the grapes and olive and pomegranate gardens which resemble each other in Surat and parted when it melts and hardens; There are a lot of problems for them and they made Jinnat a God of their own, although Jinnat himself was also born, but even those people did not understand the son of God Daughters made a stronghold in the things that people tell, it is Pak and Pakiza and Barter is a lover of all the sky and the land, how can there be any boy when he does not have a wife and he has produced everything and the same There is a lot of knowledge about the thing; Allah is your lover, but no one else is the creator of the same; if he is the creator of everything, then worship him and he is the object of everything
 Switch to can not see and he sees a lot of eyes and large granular Bean vide You have already come to the suggested things, then if you see, for your own sake and even if you become blind), you are on it and that i am not giving you anything, and we make verses and say it in reverse
 So that those people can also agree that you have read and so that you can make a very good statement for the people you know and do whatever you have to 'do' on behalf of your family
 No one except God and stay away from the people and if God wants to, then these people would not have attained any pain and we have not made you a blessing of those people and neither are you responsible for them and they worship whom except Allah Do not call them bad, otherwise these people also do not consider themselves to be bad, they are saying bad things with disrespect in such a way that we have done well by giving them the amla of every gang
 Then they have to return to their family then whatever in the world God was telling them that they will tell them and they ate the strictest of their kind, that if they get any chance, they will surely bring honor to you
 You say that you are the only one and you know that this is true That even when there is a chance, they will not believe and we will reverse their hearts and their eyes in the same way that these people do not believe the first death on the Quran and we have given them their strength We will leave you in the womb to be the angels and if we would even approach the angels with them and start talking to them and all the things) even if that gang would bring them in front of them, they were not going to believe but when Allah wants them but Do not often know that if they do not act in the same way, then they will leave them and their confessions and so that those who do not bring their trust to the end will have their hearts towards them
 Take it and like them and so that those who iftera evil people i do it myself, i should search for someone else except God, although he is the only one who has revealed the book you have and the people whom we have given the book, they surely know that it is your God
 If you have been criticized from the side, do not turn away from those who do it and your truth in justice and justice is fulfilled by someone
 Not a dalit and he is a big listener, and there are so many people in the world that if you follow his word, then you will mislead you in the way of God, these people only advocate their ideas and these people are just guessing things They do those who are seduced by his path, they know him well and he is well aware of the instructed Yafta people, so if you believe in his verses Eat the one on whom Zebah is named and what has happened to you Do not eat the God who has been named, although the things he has destroyed on you have made you feel sarcastic, but when you are compelled, however and many often deceive you from your destructive desires, and Your family is well aware of those who rightfully leave Zahiri and the inferior sinners, those who commit the crime, they should know only about their Amal Will be brought and do not eat from the name of God which is not taken from you, it is a cruel misconduct and the devotees take care in the heart of their air accounts so that they quarrel with you and if you agree to them, then you will be out Also be happy, who was the dead person, then we resurrected him and made a noor for him through which he moves among people, that person can be faced with Sector condition that could not get any kind of there in the darkness of the non-believers For this their amalas have been worshiped and in the same way as they are in maize, we have made their relatives in every colony so that they do the crafty and they do what they do in their own right and do not understand and when they have If a sign has come, it is said that till we will not be given the thing that the Prophet has given to God, then at that time we will not believe and God will live where our Prophet The person who knows the crime knows that those who are criminals will have a lot of resentment and hard work in the punishment of their cravings, then God will make the chest of the person whom he wants to show the way to Islam and whom Wants to leave in the condition of cowardice, his chest hurts a bitter misfortune, Goya has to climb the sky for those who do not bring honor to God Do not give Musllt same way evil and direct way of your Lord We have made our import statements for those who have achieved peace, for them, there is a house of peace and tranquility in their family and for the activities they did in the world, they will be guarded by them and on the day God will be deposited Will do and will tell you, o gang, Jinnat, you have increased your presence to many men, people who were friends with men will say that our cradle The ones we have benefited from each other and to get our punishment, the time you had done for me, now we have reached that time, in response to that God, You will be the whereabouts of all of you, and you will always be there, but whoever you want to be, your lover is a true narrator, and in the same way, we will make the falcon against your hawks because of their deeds of hawk
 Do not come what you tell us from our scriptures and scare you away from the text of that day, we will all earn it ourselves You give your testimony, the life of the world has put them in the dark and they have testified against themselves
 All of them were disbelievers and it is because of this that your family never forced the settlements to persecute the local people there
 In the state of grief, no one does halak and everyone who is doing it is in the custody of everyone and whatever they do, your family is better than that
 Not news, and your family is going to care - if you want, take everyone Bring and after you whom you can make your life the way you have created you from other people's children, the unfortunate thing that is promised to you is going to come and you cannot help in saying that you are my soul Instead of doing whatever you want, i am implementing it, then you will know at last that for whom the oppressed people will not succeed at all and these people themselves They share a part of the cultivation and chapis that they have produced and they say that they are good and they do not have access to their own and that part of their own is their own
 He will reach his court, what evil orders do they have, and in the same way, many people have shown their love to kill their children
 Put them in Hlakt and got them their true Deen Jul give and that God If people do not do such a thing, then you leave your and iftera ghouls and these people start thinking about their thoughts that this chapa and this cultivation is untouchable except that which no one wants to eat and that some charpas are such It is forbidden to ride on the back and some charps are such that they do not even take the name of God, and then they are fraudulent
 Will punish the people very soon and the Kuffar also says that the child who is in the stomach of those animals is only halal for our men and is harmless on our women and if he is dead then all of them are in it, they are almost without doubt
 Will be punished for making things better He tied the Iftera on himself and destroyed himself and he is in a severe loss When similar and mismatched fruits, eat their fruits and give them the right of God on the day of their cutting, and do not spend on fuzzy expenses - because it does not incur a wasteful expenditure and some of the cronies bear the burden And eat some of the land that God has given you to live, and do not follow the step of the yatan, he is sure you are an open enemy, born eight pairs Let's ask two sheep and two goats if God has killed both the males or the two women or the child who has been taken inside the belly of those two women, if you are true then understand me Tell me and ask two camels and two of the cow that God has killed both those males or the two female ones or the child who has taken the stomachs of both the females inside, when God has given you Has ordered you were present at that time and which lie on God Botahn Who would be more obstinate than that, in order to mislead the people that they think God does not reach the destination in prison, you say that what i have come to me as the same, nothing in that person who eats it is forbidden But if it is a dead or flowing blood or a swine of swine, then it is disgraceful and hapless, or a hater of disdain that someone other than God is named If the person who is gone is unafraid and does not grow and eat in this condition, then your family is a big calf, and we have destroyed all the unruly animals on the Jews, and both the cow and goat grapes are also destroyed on them
 But we had given them the punishment of their head, which was given on both their backs or on their bowls or on the bones, and it was not only that we definitely Sector are that he will Jhutlaaॅ you say that your Lord High He is unfortunate but his miracle does not stop from the guilty people, he will surely say that if God wants us, we will not have any pain and neither our fathers nor we can do anything on ourselves in the same way that people who have gone before them have denied Even those people tasted our wonders, you say if you have a plea, take it out for us and you will do it yourself
 You plead with the name and only talk speculatively, you say that the plea that is to be taken for God is special for yourself, then if that is what you want, then you would instruct everyone to say that by bringing your witnesses and present who will testify These things have been destroyed by God, then even if he testifies, then you should not bear witness with them and those who have denied our verses and do not believe in the end and others Not you us your Lord make head not walk in their Nfsiani Khwahison Tell them that let me read the things that God has forbidden you, that you do not make anything of a god and settle the righteousness with your parents and do not kill your children with the fear of Muflissi We are the ones who give you the blessing, and do not go too close to the bad guys, may it be manifest or illicit and do not kill anyone who has been killed by God himself, but in the sense of right Those are the things that God has commanded you so that you may understand and do not even get close to the goods of Yatim, but in a way that is even better to reach the limits of his youth and complete the measure and weight with justice Do not hurt a person more than his strength, and when you say this, if you are a lover of justice, and fulfill the blessings of God, these are the things that are themselves Who do achieve that given you orders not you ibrat and that's my If there is a straight path, then go to the same path and do not follow the other way that they will scatter you from the path of God, these are the things which God has commanded you so that you become a caregiver, then we will do what is right
 In order to do this, Moses had to make a book and he had everything in it and) instructed and repentant so that those people would believe in being present in front of the family and this The book that we have, then you people should defend the same and be afraid so that you can be kind to them

 Independence was a foreign department of the erstwhile British Indian government
 iskaa sarvapratham nirmaan vaaran hestings ke kaal main 1784 main kiya gaya tha
 Until 1842, it was known as the Secret and Political Department, later it came to be called the Foreign Department
 iske teen up vibhaag the- videsh, raajnneetik or grih
 After 1914, it came to be called Foreign and Political Department
 1935 ke adhinium ke parinamswaroop bade huye kaaryon ke kaaran videsh or raajnneetik vibhaagon ko alag swatantra vibhaagon main kar diya gaya
 In 1945, this department was given the new name "foreign Department and Commonwealth Relations Department"
 1946 ko antarim sarkaar kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane par nehru ne is vibhaag kaa nirdesan apane haathon main liya
 In March 1949, these two departments of the Ministry were merged and renamed as Ministry of External Affairs, by which name it is still known

 According to the parliamentary system, foreign policy formulation is basically the responsibility of the Cabinet
 videsh mantri, mantrimandal ke vichararth samasya rakhata he or jab mantrimandal un par nirnay letaa he to ye nirnay sansad ke vichararth rakhe jate hai
 Here these open discussions take place

 Since Nehru was the Prime Minister as well as the Foreign Minister, due to the plethora of work, it was thought that a qualified person should be appointed to look after the work of the Foreign Department, which could give them proper advice
 1947 se 1964 tak videsh vibhaag kaa kaary bhaar ek mahasachiv sar girija shankar vaajapeyi par tha
 Nehru had unwavering faith in him and he used to consult him constantly
 1964 main pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri dwaara sardaar swarnasingh ke videshmantri niyukt kar dene par yah sochaa gaya ki ab mahasachiv kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, atah yah pad samaapt kar diya gaya
 The Foreign Secretary is considered the highest official of the department
 videsh sachiv kii sahaytarth do sachiv videshi maamle 1 tathaa sachiv videsh maamle 2 hua karte the, baad main inhen sachiv kaha jane laga
 The State Department is divided into 20 sub-departments, headed by Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary or Director
 ye vibhaag prashasnic, pradeshik or kaary sambandhi hote hai
 For their help and consultation, a mentoring system is organized on a philanthropic basis in which the work is ordered from above, the administrative department is concerned only with the administration, so it does not contribute to the policy making process
 anya do vibhaagon-pradeshik va kaary sambandh- dwaara soochnaaon ko ekatrit kar videsh mantri ko paraamarsh diya jaataa he
 The information is received from the Indian embassies and consulates worldwide

 yiiuma sampradaay ke anuyaayi unhen dwitiya buddha maanate hai
 It is believed that when King Arshadhar of Mandi came to know that his daughter had learned from Guru Padmasambhava, he ordered Guru Padmasambhava to be burnt in the fire, because Buddhism was not very prevalent at that time and suspected it Was seen from sight bahut badi chita banaai gai jo saat din tak jalati rahi
 This created a lake there, out of which a lotus flower, Guru Padmasambhava appeared as a teenage boy

 Keyboards were also built on the QWERTY layout after the invention of the computer

 The development of Hindi typewriters was a very complex task
 kaaran yah ki devanagari ke anek chihn yen-ken prakaren 26 kunjiyon par hi vyavasthit karne the
 In addition to being mechanical, the typewriter could not add quantities on its own like a computer, nor make conjuncts according to alphabetical order, so all the keys, quantities, conjuncts had to be memorized separately
 is kaaran tiperiter kaa leout atyant jatil ho gaya
 But at that time it was the only means of typing Hindi
 computer par unicode pranali lagu se pehle uske liye non-unicode font isi leout par aadhaarit banaaye gayi
 But after the arrival of Unicode, the simple script was made possible by the script processing engine making it possible to automatically reveal quantities and conjuncts etc

 In mathematics, Borel collection or Borel collection is a compilation method given by Emile Borel for divergent categories
 yah vidhi mukhyatah apsaari alakshani shreniyon kaa yoga praapt karne ke liye upyogi he tathaa kuch arthon main aisi shreniyon ke liye sarvshereshth parinaam detii he
 Various variations are found in this method and all these methods are also called boreal compilation and its generalization is called 'miteg-liffler compilation'
 yahan par kam se kam teen vidhiyaan alp parivartan ke saath di gayi hai jinhen boral sankalan kaha jaataa he
 These can be applied at different places, but the results are consistent, ie if the sum of the same series is obtained by two or more methods, then it is achieved equally
 mana a ek ghaat shrenee ko nirupit karata he And define boreal conversion equation of a which is its equivalent exponential range
 mana An aanshik yoga ko nirupit karata he a weak method of collection of boreal defines the boreal sum of a as follows yadi yah kuch a ke liye z ∈ c par apasarit hoti he to a kaa durbal boral yoga z par abhisarit hoti he or ise ∑ a k z k = a { \ displaystyle { \ textstyle \ sum }a_{k}z^{k}=a \ ,} likhte hai
 Suppose the Boral collection on all real numbers for a function increases slowly enough that the following integral is well defined, then the Boral collection of a is given by the following formula yadi samakalan kuch a ke liye z ∈ c par abhisarit hota he tab a kaa abhisaran z par abhisarit hota he or ise ∑ a k z k = a { \ displaystyle { \ textstyle \ sum }a_{k}z^{k}=a \ ,} likhaa jaataa he
 This is the same as the Boral integral compilation method, only here the Boral summation does not have to converge for all t but converges on the analytic function of t near 0, which follows the analytic following the positive real axis
 kumbh parv hindu dharm kaa ek mahatvapurn parv he, jisamen karodon shraddhalu kumbh parv sthal haridwar, prayag, ujjain or nasik main snaan karte hai

 This yoga occurring on Makar Sankranti is called "kumbh snan-yoga" and this day is considered to be special Manglik, because it is believed that on this day the gates of the higher worlds open on this day and thus bath on this day By doing this, the soul gets to the higher realities easily
 yahan snaan karnaa saakshaat swarg darshan mana jaataa he
 The word 'ardha' means half and for this reason Ardh Kumbh is held between the complete Aquarius held at a gap of twelve years, ie, six years after the full Aquarius

 According to this legend, when Indra and other gods became weak due to the curse of Maharishi Durvasa, the demons attacked and defeated the gods
 tab sab devtaa milakar bhagwaan vishnu ke paas gaye or unhe sara vrutant sunaaya
 Then Lord Vishnu along with the demons advised him to churn the Kshirsagar and extract the nectar
 bhagwaan vishnu ke aisa kehane par sampurna devtaa daityon ke saath sandhi karke amrit nikaalane ke ytn main lag gaye
 At the behest of the nectar Kumbh, at the behest of the gods, Indraputra 'jayant' flew into the sky carrying the nectar-urn
 uske baad daityaguru shukracharya ke aadeshaanusaar daityon ne amrit ko waapas lene ke liye jayant kaa peechha kiya or ghor parishram ke baad unhone bich raste main hi jayant ko pakadaa
 After that, there was a continuous war for twelve days among the Devas and Demons to take control of the Amrit Kalash
 is paraspar markat ke dauraan prithvi ke chaar sthanon par kalash se amrit boonden giri thim
 At that time, the Moon protected the Ghata from transmitting, the Sun from erupting, the Guru from the abduction of the demons, and Shani protecting the deity from Devendra's fear
 kalah shant karne ke liye bhagwaan ne mohini rup dhaaran kar yathadhikaar sabko amrit baantkar pilaa diya
 Thus the Dev-demon war was ended
 amrit prapti ke liye dev-daanvon main paraspar baarah din tak nirantar yuddh hua tha
 The twelve days of the gods are comparable to the twelve years of humans

 software pareekshan ek anubhavjanya khoj he, jiske tahat hitdharakon ko pareekshanadhin utpaada yaa seva kii gunvattta ke bare main, us sandarbh main jaankaree uplabdh karai jaati he, jahaan ise prayog ke liye niyat kiya gaya he
 Software testing also provides an objective and independent overview of the software, to allow the industry to understand and appreciate the risks in the implementation of the software
 test takneekon main shaamil he, lekin itane tak hi simit nahin, software bag khojane ke iraade se ek program yaa anuprayog ke nishpaadan kii prakriya
 It can also be said that software testing is the process that validates and verifies that a software program / application / product: karyrat pareekshan paddati ke aadhaar par, software pareekshan ko vikaas kii prakriya main kisi bhi samay lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 However, most test attempts begin when the requirements have been defined and the coding process is complete
 vibhinn software vikaas model, vikaas kii prakriya main pareekshan prayaas ko vibhinn charnon par kendrit karte hai
 In a more traditional model, most testing efforts begin when the requirements have been defined and the coding process is complete
 apekshaakrit nae vikaas model, jaise Agile yaa XP, aksar vikaas sanchalit pareekshan kaa prayog karte hai or vikaas kii prakriya main pareekshan kaa zyada hissaa, develper ko saunpte hai
 Testing cannot identify all defects within the software as a whole
 iske bajaay, yah ek aalochana yaa tulana prastut karata he, jo pramanik- siddhant yaa vyavastha ke prati, jiske dwaara ek vyakti kisi samasya ko pahchaan saktaa he - utpaada kii sthiti or vyavhaar kii tulana karata he
 These authentications may include specifications, contracts, comparable products, previous versions of the same product, estimates of intended or expected objectives, user or customer expectations, appropriate standards, usability rules, or other criteria
 har software utpaada ke lakshith darshak hote hai
 For example, the viewer of video game software is completely different from banking software
 isliye, jab ek sanghathan kisi software utpaada ko viksit athwa usamen nivesh karata he, to vah yah akalan kar saktaa he ki software utpaada apane antim upyogkartaaon, apane lakshith darshakon, apane kharidaaron or anya hitdharakon ko sweekaarya hoga yaa nahin
 Software testing is the process of attempting this evaluation
 2002 main NIST dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan se yah pataa chalata he ki software bag se america arthvyavastha ko salanaa $59
5 bilian kii chapat lagati he
 If better software testing is done, a third of this cost can be saved
 prarambh main pareekshan se dibging ke pruthakkaran ko glenford je
 myrs dwaara 1979 main pravartit kiya gaya
 Although their focus was on breakage testing it confirmed the software engineering community's desire to separate basic development activities, such as debugging, from verification
 dev gelprin or wiliam si
 hetzel ne 1988 main software pareekshan main pravasthaon or lakshyon ko nimnlikhit charnon main vargeekrut kiya he: a primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures, so that faults can be discovered and corrected
 yah ek gaiyr-naganya khoj he
 Testing cannot establish that a product is working properly under all conditions, but can only establish that it does not work properly under what specific conditions
 software pareekshan ke kaaryakshetra main aksar code kii pariksha ke alaava vibhinn vaataavaran or paristhitiyon main us code kaa nishpaadan, saath hi, us code ke pahaluon kii jaanch shaamil he: kya yah vah kaary karata he jo ise karnaa chahie or kya yah, vah karata jo ise karne kii zarurat he
 In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may differ from the development team
 pareekshan dal ke sadasyon ke liye vibhinn bhoomikaayen hotin hai
 Information obtained from software testing can be used to correct the process by which software is developed
 functional pareekshan us pareekshan se sambandh rakhata he, jo code kii ek vishisht karrwai yaa prakaarya ko satyapit karata he
 This is usually found in the documentation of code requirements, although some development processes, use cases or user reports work
 functional test is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hai ki "kya upyogkarta ise kar saktaa he" yaa "kya yah vishesh suvidha kaam karti he"
 Non-functional testing refers to aspects of software that may not be related to a particular function or user action, such as mounting or security
 Non-functional testing answers questions such as "how many people can log in at once", or "how easy it is to hack this software"
 software ke sabhi dosha, code kii trutiyon ke kaaran nahin hote hai
 a common source of costly faults arises due to the expectation interval, for example, unrecognized expectations, which result in deletion errors by the program designer
 apeksha interval kaa ek aam strot, gair-kaaryaatmak apeksha he, jaise pareekshan-kshamta, arohan-kshamta, anurakshan-kshamta, upyog-kshamta, nishpaadan or suraksha
 Software defects occur through the following processes
 programmer ek truti karata he, jo software ke sorce code main ek karaabi main falit hota he
 If this malfunction is performed, in some special cases the system will produce an erroneous result, which will cause a failure
 sabhi dosha aavashyak rup se vifaltaa main parinat nahin honge
 Defects in dead code, for example, will never result in failure
 jab parivesh badla jaataa he, tab ek karaabi vifaltaa main badal sakati he
 Examples of these environmental changes include running the software on a new hardware platform, changing source data, or interacting with different software
 a single error may result in extended symptoms of failure
 aam taur par yah mana jaataa he ki ek karaabi ko jitna pehle khoja jaae, use thik karnaa utana hi sasta hota he
 The following table shows the cost of fixing the malfunction, based on the stage of detection
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi apekshaaon main koi samasya sirf release ke baad saamne aati he, to iskaa kharchaa apekshaaon kii samiksha dwaara hi pataa laga liye jane ke kharche se 10-100 guna adhik hoga
 a common cause of software failure is compatibility with other applications, a new operating system, or, a growing web browser version
 pasch sangatta kii kami ke maamle main, yah isliye ho saktaa he, kyonki programmer ne apane program kii koding yaa software kaa pareekshan sirf, is-or-us oparating system "ke naveenatam sanskaran" par karne kaa vichaar kiya
 An unintended consequence of this fact is that: their latest work may not be fully compatible with the prior mix of software / hardware, or it may not be fully compatible with another important operating system
 kisi bhi sthiti main, ye matbhed, ve jo bhi hon, software vifaltaa main parinat hue honge, jaisaa ki computer prayoktaaon ke kuch mahatvapurn tabake ne mahasoos kiya
 One might consider this to be a "security-oriented strategy" that fits precisely with the latest testing phase suggested by Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel, as cited below
 
 a major problem with software testing is that testing is not possible under all combinations of input and pre-conditions, even with a common product
 iskaa matlab he ki software utpaada main dosha kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho sakati hai or jo dosha kabhi-kabhi hote hai unhen pareekshan main khojna mushkil he
 More importantly, non-functional dimensions of quality - usability, mountability, performance, compatibility, reliability - can be highly subjective; Something that constitutes sufficient value for one person, unbearable for another
 software pareekshan ke liye kai drushtikon hai
 Review, cross-over, or inspection is considered static testing, while the actual executed program code with a given set of test cases is considered a dynamic test
 static pareekshan ko choda ja saktaa he
 Dynamic testing is used when the program itself is being used for the first time
 dinemic pareekshan, program ke 100% purna hone se pehle code ke vishesh hisson ke pareekshan ke liye shuru ho sakati he 
 Typical techniques for this are using stubs / drivers or execution from a debugger environment
 For example, spreadsheet programs are, by their very nature, mutually tested to a large extent, under which results are displayed immediately after each calculation or text operation
 software pareekshan kaa prayog satyaapan or pramanikaran ke saahchary se kiya jaataa he: The term verification and authentication are commonly used interchangeably in industry; It is also common to misinterpret these two words
 IEEE software ejineering kii maanak shabdaawalee ke anusaar: Software testing can be done by a software tester
 1980 ke dashak tak shabd "software tester" ko aam taur par istemaal kiya jaataa tha, lekin baad main ise ek alag vyavsaay ke rup main dekha gaya
 Various roles related to periods and different goals have been established in software testing: Manager, Test Lead, Test Designer, Tester, Automation Developer and Test Administrator haalanki vivaadaaspad, software pareekshan ko software quality ashurence prakriya ke ek mahatvapurn hisse ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 At SQA, software process specialists and auditors have a comprehensive view on software and its development
 ve software ejineering prakriya kii jaanch karte hai or pradutt software main maujuud dosha: tathakthith dosha dar kii maatra ko kam karne ke liye use hi badal dete hai
 What constitutes an "acceptable defect rate" depends on the nature of the software
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek arched video game main, jise ek hawaii jahaaj udaane kaa abhas dene ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, sambhawatah dosha ke prati apekshaakrit adhik sahansheeltaa hogi, us mishan critical software kii tulana main, jiskaa upyog ek airliner ko niyantrit karne main hota he, jo vastav main ud rahaa he
 Although there are close associations with SQA, testing departments often operate independently and may not have SQA functions in a company
 software pareekshan, ek computer program ke apekshit parinaamon ko, die gaye ek input set ke liye, iske vaastavik parinaamon se tulana karte hue, software main dosha kaa pataa lagane ke uddeshy se kiya gaya kaary he
 Paradoxically, QA is the implementation of policies and procedures aimed at preventing errors from occurring
 software pareekshan tareeqon ko paramparaagat rup se blike box pareekshan or white box pareekshan main vibhajit kiya gaya hai
 Both of these approaches are used to describe the approach that a test engineer adopts for designing test cases
 blike box pareekshan, software se ek "blike box" ke rup main vyavhaar karata he - bina kisi aantarik karyanvayan kii jaankaree ke blike box pareekshan tareekon main shaamil hai: equivelens partishning, boundry vailu enelysis, ol peyars pareekshan, faj pareekshan, model-besd pareekshan, tresebility metrics, exploretary pareekshan or spacification-aadhaarit pareekshan
 Therefore, black box testing has the advantage of "an unsympathetic opinion" on the one hand and a "blind search" on the other
 white box pareekshan tab hoti he jab pareekshak ke paas, aantarik data sanrachanaon or ise lagu karne vaale code sahit elgoridam tak pahunch sulabh hoti he
 They both return a code coverage metric, measured as a percentage
 grey box pareekshan main shaamil he aantarik data sanrachanaon or elgoridam tak, pareekshan maamalon ko dizin karne ke liye pahunch, lekin upyogkarta, yaa blike box str par pareekshan
 input data kaa parivartan or output ko formet karnaa, grey box ke tahat nahin aata, kyonki input or output us "blike-box" se spasht rup se baahar he, jise ham pareekshan ke tahat system kah rahe hai
 This difference is particularly important when performing integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interface is presented for testing
 haalanki, ek data bhandar ko sanshodhit karnaa zarur grey box ke antargat aata he, chunki aam taur par upyogkarta pareekshan ke tahat system ke baahar data badalane main sakasham nahin hoga
 Gray box testing may also include reverse engineering, for example, to determine the bounding value or error message
 pareekshanon ko aksar, software vikaas prakriya main unke shaamil hone kii jagah ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, yaa pareekshan kii vishistataa ke str dwaara
 Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a particular section of code, usually at the process level
 ek object-unmukh parivesh main, yah aksar shrenee str par hota he or nunatam ikai pareekshan main shaamil hota he constructor or distractor
 These types of tests are typically written by developers when they are working on code to ensure that a particular process is working properly as expected
 code main corner caces yaa anya shakhaon ko pakadaney ke liye, ek prakriya main kai pareekshan ho sakate hai
 Unit testing, alone, cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but is used to ensure that the building blocks used by the software function independently of each other
 integration pareekshan kisi bhi prakaar kaa software pareekshan he, jo ek software dizin ke prati ghatakon ke bich interphes ko satyapit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Software components can be integrated iteratively or together
 aam taur par pehle vaale tareeqe ko ek behatar abhyaas mana jaataa he, chunki yah interfes muddon ko twarit rup se sthaneey hone or thik hone kii anumati detaa he
 Integration testing works to expose errors in interfaces and to show interactions between integrated components
 uttarottar, architektural dizin ke tatwon ke anuroop jaanche gaye software ghatakon ke bade samoohon ko ekikrut or tab tak jaancha jaataa he, jab tak software ek system ke rup main kaam naa karne lage
 System testing tests a fully integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements
 system integration pareekshan yah pushti karata he ki ek system, system aavashyaktaaon main paribhaashit kisi bhi bahari yaa anya paksh ke system se ekikrut he
 Regression testing focuses on finding faults after a major code change
 vishesh rup se, yah software pratigaman ko yaa puraane bag jo waapas aa gaye hai, unhen ujagar karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Such regressions occur whenever the software process, which was previously working correctly and now stops working as expected
 vishisht rup se, pratigaman, program parivartan ke ek anpekshit parinaam ke rup main ghatit hote hai, jab software kaa nav viksit hissaa, pehle se maujuud code ke saath takaraata he
 Common methods of regression testing include replaying previously run tests and checking if previously corrected errors have reappeared
 pareekshan kii gaharaai, jari prakriya main charan par nirbhar karti he or atirikt visheshtaon ke jokhim par
 ve yaa to purna ho sakate hai, release main kaaphi der se jode gaye parivartanon ke liye yaa phir jokhim bhare, bahut uthle tak, prayek suvidha par sakaaratmak pareekshan se bane hue, agar badlaav, relies main jaldi ho rahe hai yaa kam jokhim vaale samajhe jate hai
 Acceptance testing can refer to one of two: alpha pareekshan, sambhavit upyogkartaaon / graahakon yaa develper kii site par ek swatantra test team dwaara nakli yaa vaastavik sanchaalan pareekshan he
 Before the software went into beta testing, alpha testing is often used as a form of internal acceptance testing for off-the-shelf software
 beta pareekshan alpha pareekshan ke baad aata he
 The software version, known as the beta version, was released to a limited clientele outside the programming team
 software ko logon ke samoohon ke liye jari kiya jaataa he, taaki aage ke pareekshan yah sunishchit kar saken ki utpaada main nunatam kharabiyaan yaa bag hai
 Sometimes, the beta version is made available to the open public to increase the response area to the maximum number of prospective users
special methods exist to review software ke gair-kaaryaatmak pahaluon ke pareekshan ke liye vishesh tareeqe maujuud hai
 Unlike functional testing, which establishes the correct operation of software, non-functional testing confirms that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected input
 software folt injection, fajing ke rup main, ek gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan kaa udhaaharan he
 Non-functional testing, specifically for the sake of software, is designed to establish whether the construct under the test can tolerate invalid or unexpected input and thus the input validation routine as well as the error - Will be able to establish the strength of the handling routine
 vibhinn vanijyik gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan upkaran, software folt injection prishth se jude hote hai; kai khule strot ke or muft software upkaran uplabdh hai, jo gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan karte hai
 Performance testing, or load testing, checks to see if the software can handle large amounts of data or users
 aam taur par ise software scalebility ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as a capability test
 sthaitv pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software ek sweekaarya avadhi main yaa usase upar, lagaataar acchhee tarah se kaary karata saktaa he yaa nahin
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as load testing
 prayojyata pareekshan kii jarurat yah jaanchane ke liye hoti he ki yuzar interfes kaa upyog karnaa or use samajhnaa aasaan he yaa nahin
 Security testing is required for software that refines confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers
 anterrashtriyakaran or sthaniyakaran kii jarurat software ke in pahaluon kii jaanch ke liye hoti he, jiske liye ek chhadmasthaniyakaran vidhi kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 This will confirm that the application works even after being translated into a new language or adapted to a new culture
 vinaashak pareekshan, software yaa up-pranali ko isaki majbootee ke jaanch ke liye, vifal karne kaa prayaas karti he
 a common method of software testing is performed by an independent group of testers, before it is sent to the client and after its functionality is developed
 is abhyaas ke parinamswaroop aksar pareekshan charan kaa, pariyojna main hui deree kii kshatipurti ke liye pariyojna bafer ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he or is prakaar se pareekshan ke liye samarpit samay ke saath samjhauta hota he
 Another practice is to start software testing from the moment the project starts and it is a continuous process till the completion of the project
 jawaab main, kuch aise ubharate software vishay jaise extream programing or azeil software development andolan, ek "test driven software development" model kaa paalan karte hai
 In this process, unit tests are first written by the software engineer
 Of course these tests initially fail; As expected from them
 or phir jaise hi code likhaa jaataa he yah pareekshan sweet ke bade ansh ke sanwarddhit rup se gujarata he
 Test suites are constantly renewed and integrated with any developed regression test due to new failure conditions and corner cases
 baaki software sorce code ke saath unit test ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he or aam taur par bild prakriya main ekikrut kiya jaataa he 
 Although variation exists between organizations, there is a specific cycle for testing
 nimna namoona, water fall deveopment model ko apnaane vaale sanghathanon ke bich aam he
 Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially such groups that use jotest driven development
 test likhane ke kai fremawork hai or satat ekikaran software, pareekshan ko swatah chalaaegaa, jab har baar code ek varjan control system main parkhaa jayega
 While automation cannot build everything that a human can, it can be very useful for regression testing
 tathaapi, vastav main upyogi hone ke liye, isamen script pareekshan kii ek purna viksit test sweet kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Program testing and fault detection can be greatly assisted by test equipment and debuggers
 pareekshan / dibg upkarnon kii visheshtaon main shaamil hai: Some of these properties can be incorporated into an integrated development environment
 aam taur par, jin vishyon tak gunvattta simit hoti he, ve hai shuddhta, sampoornataa, suraksha, lekin ISO maanak ISO 9126 ke tahat varnit adhik takneekee aavashyaktaaen bhi shaamil ho sakati hai, jaise kshamta, vishwasaneeyata, dakshata, suvahyata, rakh-rakhaav, sangatta or 0}prayojyata
 Several common software measures exist, often called 'metrics', which are used to measure the software's condition or test adequacy
 software pareekshan prakriya kai artiffact ko utpann kar sakati he
 Several certification programs exist to bolster the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists
 vartmaan main pradaan kiye jane vaale pramann main aisa koi nahin he, jisamen vastav main aavedak ke liye software pareekshan kii kshamta ko pradarshit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 No certification is based on a widely accepted framework of knowledge
