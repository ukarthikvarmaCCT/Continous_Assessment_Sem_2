 The definition of "international NGO" is first given in the 288 Resolution of the ECOSOC on 27 February 1950: it is defined as "any international organization not established by an international treaty"

 One frequently used classification is the division into relief-oriented as opposed to development-oriented organizations; They may also be divided according to whether they put more emphasis on service delivery or participation, or whether they are religious or secular and they are more public or private oriented
 Operational ngos can be community-based, national or international
 ek pratipaalan gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kaa praathmik uddeshy ek vishisht vishay ko badhaava dena yaa uskaa paksh samarthan karnaa he

 Examples include: improving the state of the natural environment, promoting adherence to human rights, improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing the agenda of a company

 Not all persons working in ngos are voluntary
 The reason for this is that volunteers are not necessarily full benefactors, and with skill, experience and contacts can provide immediate benefits to themselves, as well as those they are serving

 The hard disk, ie hard disk operator, was first introduced in 1956 as a data storage device for ibm's real-time transmission processing computer
 yah saamaanya upyog, menfrem or chote computer par istemaal karne ke liye bhi viksit kiya gaya tha
 This first IBM Drive 350R Mac was as big as two refrigerators and had the capacity to hold 5 million 6 bit characters
 yah aankadon ko 50 discs ke dher par sahejataa tha
 In 1962, IBM Model 1311 brought a disk drive that was the size of a washing machine and could hold 2 million characters on a removable disk pack
 upyogkarta atirikt pack kharid sakate the or unhen zaroorat ke anusaar aapas main badal sakate the, bilkul chumbakeey tepe ke reel kii tarah
 Subsequently, disk pack drives that were created by IBM and other companies began being used in computers and by the 1980s it reached a capacity of 300 megabytes
 jin HDD ko computaron se hataaya nahin ja saktaa tha unhen "phixd discs" drive kaha jaataa hai
 Some high performance hdds were made with one nozzle per track such as IBM 2305 so that the time spent in moving the nozzle from one track to another could be saved
 inhen "phixd head" yaa "head par trek" discs drive kaha jaataa tha
 They were very expensive and are no longer made
 1973 main ai bi ium ne ek nae kism kii achdidi launch kii jisko "vincester" kuta naam diya gaya tha
 The primary thing in this was that the disc head did not completely separate from the platter when the power went out
 balki yah head discs ke ek khaas jagah main rukta tha tab jab discs kaa ghoomana band ho jaataa tha
 The disc head used to start with the same when restarted
 yah head pravartak pranali ke kharche ko kam karne main kargar sabit hua
 The first drives of Winchester technology had removable circular parts
 isamen discs pack or likhane va padhane vaali nok pranali hoti thi
 The promoter used to live in a wheel connected to the motor
 iske baad vaale "vincester" drivs main hathaaye ja sakane vaale discs pack ko hataa or waapas gaiyr hataane yogya discs plantres kaa istemaal hone laga
 Earlier Winchester Drives had planters with a diameter of 14 inches
 kuch saal baad is baat kii sambhaavna dhundha jane laga ki agar plantres chote hon to shaayad usase kuch or phaayde ho sakate hai
 Drives with 8-inch diameter planters followed, followed by drives with 5 1 / 4-inch diameter planters
 5 1 / 4 inch vaale drivs ko us samay main tezi se badhate hue vyaktigat computers ke bazaar ke liye roopaankit kiya gaya tha
 hdds were very expensive in the early 1980s, but by the late 1980s, their prices had reduced to such an extent that they were also used in the cheapest computers
 1980 ke dashak ke shuruyaat main zyaadaatar HDD vyaktigat computer upyogkarta ko alag se up pranali ke taur par bechaa jaataa tha
 This subsystem was sold not in the name of the drive manufacturer but in the name of the subsystem manufacturer such as Corvus Systems, Tallgrass Technologies either in the name of the manufacturer such as Apple Profile
 ai0bi0ium0 pisi / eks tii jo ai bi ium ne 1983 main launch kiya tha, main ek 10 megabite kaa andruni achdidi tha or iske baad se hi vyaktigat computers main andruni achdidi niyamit taur se istemaal hone lage
 External hdds have been used for a long time on Apple Macintosh
 1986 se 1998 ke bich bahari achdidi ko jodne ke liye harek macintosh computer main peeche ke taraf ek es si es ai port hua karata tha
 The 2011 floods in Thailand damaged many data storage plant-producing plants, causing data storage plant prices to rise between 2012-2013
 achdidi ke avishkaar ke baad nirantar tareeke se unki hawaii ghanatv main izaafaa hota rahaa he
 The data storage device consists of a thin film of ferromagnetic material which attracts the data storage device to save the data
 krambaddh tareeke se chumbakeey kshetra ke disha kaa badlaav binary data bits ko darshata he
 The change of magnetization is checked and the data is read from the disk / device
 ek kuta lekhan vidhi istemaal karke data ko sankethik shabdon main badla jaataa he
 Such as run length limited code writing method
 jo data ko chumbakeey disha ke parivartan ke anusaar prastut karata hai
 An HDD has spindles that hold a flat round disk
 plantres saadharantah gaiyr chumbakeey padaarth jaise aluminium elaay, sheesha yaa ceremic se bane hote he
 These planters are coated with magnetic material which holds the data
 is chumbakeey padaarth ke parat kii motaai 10 se 20 nanometer hoti hai or uski suraksha ke liye uske upar carbon kii ek parat bhi hoti hai
 The layer of this magnetic material is less than the thickness of the paper, which is 7 xxrep 4 0 to 18 xxrep 4 0 nanometers
 aajkal ke hard discs ke plantres ko alag alag raftaar main ghumaya jaataa hai yah vahneey yantro main 4200 ghumaav prati minutese lekar ucch pradarshan kshamta vaale sarwar main 15000 arpm tak hoti hai
 The first HDD rotated at a speed of 1200 rpm and for many years the entire HDD rotated at 3600 rpm
 disambar 2013 tak zyaadaatar upabhokataa shrenee ke achdidi 5400 arpm yaa 7200 ghumaav prati minute kii raftaar main ghoomte hai
 The information is read or written on the plotter as the platter rotates under the reed-right head
 read - rhite head or plater main duuri bahut kam hoti hai bas kuch nanometer
 Reed - Right head works to read and replace the magnetic material under it
 aadhunik achdidi main har chumbakeey plater ke upar ek read - rhite head hota hai jo kii ek samaan bhujaa se judaa hua hota hai
 a moving arm moves the head in the direction of a circle while the disc rotates so that each head reaches the entire surface of the platter
 is bhujaa ko hilaane ke liye vaayas quayal eccuater yaa kuch puraane dizine main stepper motor istemaal kiya jaataa hai
 The magnetic plate on the drive is fitted with optical insulation
 pehle ke hard discs drivs main sthir / ek hi bits par second ke tareeke se likhaa jaataa tha isliye har patari par data saamaan hota tha
 But in modern disk drives, zone bit recording is used, in which the speed of writing keeps on going from the inside to the outside track / track, it can preserve more data in the outside tracks
 aadhunik upkarnon main chumbakeey kshetra ke chote sies ke kaaran is baat kii sambhaavna hai kii vah apni chumbakeey stithi garmi ke kaaran kho saktaa hai
 This magnetic instability caused by heat is also called the "superparamagnetic limit"
 is stithi se bachane ke liye plantres ko do samanaantar chumbakeey parato se lep kiya jaataa hai inke bich ek 3 anu motaai kaa ek gairchumbakeey parat rahata hai
 Both layers have magnetic effects in the opposite direction, thus reinforcing each other
 garmi ke prabhaav se nipatane ke liye ek or takanic istemaal hoti hai iskaa naam parpendicular recording hai
 It also gives more recording density, it was first shipped in 2005
 Today many hdds are using this technology
 ek saadhaaran HDD main do vidyutiya motor hote hai
 a spindle-mounted motor that rotates the disc and an actuator motor that moves the reed / right head system over the rotating disc
 chakrika se jude hue motor main ek bahari roter hota hai jo chakrika ke saath judaa hota hai, vidyut chaalak sthaayee ghumaavdaar taar ]ek jagah sthapit hoti hai
 There is a reed-write head on the end of the rod connected to the spindle opposite the promoter
 yah likhane / padhane vaali nok bahut patale vidyutiya paripath se emplifaire electronics ke saath judaa hota hai jo pravartak ke kendra bindu par sthit hota hai
 The supporting arm of the tip is very light and solid in weight
 aadhunik upkarnon main isaki tej hone kii gati 550 g tak ho sakati hai
 The actuator is a permanent magnet
 usame ek ghoomanevaala qoil hota hai jo sahi jagah par likhane / padhane vaali nok ko chalaata hai
 a plate of metal holds a squat neodiminum-iron-borone high-speed magnet
 is thali ke neeche ek ghoomanevaala dhaatu kaa lachha hota hai jise awaz vaali qoil bhi kehete hai
 It is connected to the center of the coil promoter and below this coil is a neodiminum-iron-boron magnet
 ise motor ke ekadam nichle thali par chadha kar rakhaa jaataa hai
 The voiced coils are shaped like the tip of an arrow and are made of 2 times coated copper wire
 andar kii sataha taap rodhan ke liye hoti hai or baahar kii sataha garm plastic kii hoti hai
 The coils on either side of the tip are attached to the magnetic field
 jab vidyut pravaah ek dhaatu ke lachchhe ke andar ke disha main gaman karti hai or duusare lachchhe ke bahari disha main gaman karti hai tab ek sparsh-rekhiy dabaav utpann hota hai jo pravartak ko ghumata hai
 The electronics of the HDD control the movement of the promoter and also control the rotation or circular movement of the disc
 vah chakrika niyantrak ke nirdesho ke anusaar chakrika se soochna padhane yaa likhane kaa kaam bhi karti hai
 The feedback from the drive electronics comes from specific parts of the disc that are dedicated to servo feedback
 yah yaa to phir puri tarah se sankendrit parimandal hote hai yaa wo hisse jisame asli aankaden bikhare hue rup me hote hai
 a data storage device or hard disk operator has one or more fast rotating discs and magnetic nozzles
 inhe ek chalate hue pravartak bhujaa ke upar rakhaa jaataa hai taaki is nok kii sahaayta se chakrika ke sataha par aankadon ko likhaa yaa padhaa ja sake
 The time it takes to move the magnetic tip to the cylinder or track, along with the time it takes to rotate part of the disc under the tip and how much data is being transmitted at every moment, on the basis of these data storage device is determined Goes
 aadhunik data bhandaran yantra truti sanshodhan kuta kaa bahut istemaal karti hai khaskar read - solman truti nivaaran kuta
 This technique saves extra bits
 har data khand main kuch atirikt bits hote hai jo kuch ganit ke sutara istemaal kar galatiyon ko adrishy tareeke se sudhaarte hai
 These extra bits do take up some space in the data storage device, but it also makes it possible to have a higher write density on the data storage device, which also makes it possible to correct the errors that occur in the process
 iskaa fal yah hota hai kii data bhandaran yantra kii bhandaaran kshamta zyaada hoti hai
 For example, a 1 TB capacity data storage device with 512 byte segments gets 93 GB additional data storage capacity
 ekadam nae data bhandaran yantra main laghu ghanatv samta jaanch kuta read-solman kii jagah lene lage hai
 L
 With the DPC code, the performances reach close to the Shannon border
 isse sabase zyaada bhandaaran ghanatv praapt hota hai
 Hard disks of mainframes and small computers used to be of different sizes
 yah washing mashin kii aakaar ke the yaa to phir 19 inch rack main samaa jaye aise aakar ke the
 IBM launched the model 1131 disc in 1962
 yah 14 inch ke chakrikaaon kaa istemaal karti thi
 This was the standard size of mainframes and small computers for many years
 microprocesar adhrith pranaaliyon main itane bade chakrikaaon kaa kabhi istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 As the sales of microprocessors with floppy disk drives increased and FDD adapters met, demand for such hard disks also increased

 leninavaad samrajyavad or sarvhaara kranti ke yug kaa marxvad he
 At the level of ideology, it is the principle and strategy of the proletarian revolution and in particular the dictatorship of the proletariat
 lenin ne utpaadan kii poonjeewaadi vidhi ke us vishleshan ko jari rakhaa jise marks ne puunji main kiya tha or samrajyavad kii paristhitiyon main aarthik tathaa raajnneetik vikaas ke niyamon ko ujagar kiya
 The creative soul of Leninism is expressed in his theory of socialist revolution
 lenin ne pratipaadit kiya ki nayi avasthaaon main samaajwaad pehle ek yaa kuch deshon main vijayi ho saktaa he
 He formulated the proletarian opinion of the proletariat as a leadership and organizing power, without which the achievement of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the creation of a communist society is impossible
 vastutah leninavaad ek lenin ke baad kii vaicharik parighatna he
 Lenin died in 1924
 apane jivan main unhone khud na to 'leninavaad' shabd kaa prayog kiya, or na hi uske prayog ko protsaahit kiya
 They expressed their ideas by placing them in the categories of Marxist, Socialist and Communist
 lenin ke is ravaiye ke vipareet unke jivan ke antim daur main soviet communist party ke sheersh communist netaaon or siddhantkaron ne lenin ke pramukh siddhanton, ranneetiyon or kaarynitiyon ke ird-gird vibhinn raajnneetik or ranneetik pariprekshya viksit kiye jinke aadhaar par aage chal kar leninavaad kaa vinyas taiyaar hua
 Nikolai Bukharin, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Stalin, Gregory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev were among these leaders
 uttar-lenin avadhi main hue satta-sangharsh main stallin kii jeet hui jiske parinamswaroop baaki netaaon ko jaan se haath dhonaa padaa
 Therefore, the form of Leninism that is in front of us today has a major imprint of Stalin's interpretations on it
 stallin ne 1934 main do pustaken likhin : "foundations of leninism" or "problems of leninism" jo leninavaad kii adhikarik samaj kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 If we accept the definition given by Stalin, Leninism is the theory and strategy of the dictatorship of the proletariat along with being the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution
 spasht he ki stallin is paribhaasha ke dwaara leninavaad ko ek saarvbhaum siddhanth kii tarah pesh karnaa chaahate the
 His success in this goal cannot be overlooked by the role of the Comintern established by Lenin in 1919 after the Soviet Revolution
 stallin kii safalataa kaa anumaan is tathy se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki duniya ke adhiktar marxvaadi kaaryakrtta or netaa marxvad ko leninavaad ke bina apurna samajhate hai
 Actually, Leninism adds something new to classical Marxism
 pehali baat to yah he ki vah keval krantikari sarvhaara par nirbhar rahane ke bajaay krantikari mehanatakashon yani mazaduron or kisaanon ke gathjod kii mukhya krantikari shakti ke rup main shinaakht karata he
 Leninism, due to its contribution, removes Marxism from the boundaries of developed industrial capitalism and makes it an ideology useful for the national liberation struggles of underdeveloped and semi-colonial countries
 leninavaad aise sabhi deshon ke communiston or anya radical tattvon ke liye kranti karne kii vyaavhaarik vidhi kaa praavdhaan ban kar ubhara he
 The importance of this dimension of Leninism can be gauged from the fact that the concept of the revolutionary front of workers and peasants has been successful in leading the communist revolution in China, Vietnam, Korea and Latin America
 jin deshon main communist krantiyaan nahin bhi ho paayin, vahaan ke communist bhi leninavaad kii isi kendriya thisis par amal karte hai
 Leninism gives top priority to revolutionary political action, and has taken the reins of this action to a disciplined Communist Party run by professional revolutionaries and based on democratic centralism
 leninavaad kii manyata he ki mazdoor varg keval apane aarthik sangharshon or anya raajnneetik gatividhiyon ke chalate swatahsfoort dhang se krantikari nahin ban saktaa
 For him, this party will become the carrier of revolutionary consciousness
 leninavaad kaa yah doosraa pahalu bhi utana hi mahatvapurn he
 Some scholars even believe that the principle of party organization is the heart of Leninism and in this lies the concept of a party ruled state
 beesvin sadi ke ekadam shuruyaat main roosi saamaajik janavaadee party ke bheetar sangharsh karte hue lenin ne roosi paristhiti ko german paristhiti se alag dikhaate hue ek jan-aadhaarit party ke bajaay gopneey raajnneeti main maahir ek choti or anushaasit kaaryakrtta aadhaarit party banane kii tajaviz kii thi
 This party of professional proletarian revolutionaries was to be the bearer of the revolutionary-democratic trend which can be clearly seen in Lenin's pre-revolution creations, especially in 'state and Revolution', although the question of the party is not discussed in this composition
 
 lenin kaa party sambandhi chintan 1918 se 1922 ke bich phir se saamne aayaa jab navjaat soviet rajya aarthik gherebandi, videshi akraman or grih yuddh se jujh rahaa tha
 Many aspects of Lenin's party that emerged during this period were not compatible with the earlier revolutionary-democratic trends
 party-sanghathan sambandhi leninavaad ke nirdeshon ko sankshep main is prakaar dekha ja saktaa he : Leninism calls this party structure as democratic centralism and most communist parties of the world follow it
 lekin pehali drushti main saaf-suthra or tarksangat lagane vaala yah dhaanchaa communist andolan ke bheetar or baahar kaaphi vivaadit rahaa he
 Lenin was also criticized by contemporary theorist Rosa Luxembourg, although she agreed with the general working of the Bolsheviks
 roza, lenin ke is sutrikaran se sahamat nahin thim ki majdoor varg main swatahsfoort krantikari chetana viksit karne kii kshamta nahin hoti
 Critics of this party-structure allege that centralism always dominates democracy within it, so it is fundamentally undemocratic
 aise sanghathan main sarvhaara varg kii taanaashaahee ke naam par ek party kii taanaashaahee sthapit karne kaa jabardast rujhaan maujuud rahata he
 In the final analysis, the rule that such a party cites to the working class transforms democratic centralism from the boundaries of party-organization to the principle of social organization
 rus main kranti kii safalataa or uske tike rahane ko lenin vishwa-kranti kii gatishiltaa ke saath jod kar dekhte the
 He therefore formed the Comintern to establish communist parties around the world and guide their politics
 komintern ne aisa kiya bhi
 The Chinese Communist Party, founded in 1921, could not be formed without its help
 lekin lenin ke baad komintern kii bhoomika badalati chali gayi
 Under the supervision of Stalin, the interests of world revolution continued to be subordinated to the geopolitical strategies of the Soviet Union
 duniya ke duusare deshon main kranti kii sambhaawanaaon par stallin dwaara paribhaashit leninavaad kaa model thopa jane laga
 China's communist revolution was on its way to success only when it refused to obey Stalin's orders sent through Comintern
 maao tse-tung ne leninavaad ko maardarshak ke rup main sweekaar kiya, par ve leninavaad kii stalineey vyakhya se dur hote chale gayi
 a situation had come when Mao refused to meet the representatives of the Comintern
 yah ek aitihaasik tathy he ki 1949 main jis samay maao china lok ganraajya kii sthapana kaa elaan kar rahe the, us samay bhi soviet sangh ne kuomingtang or uske netaa communist virdohi netaa chyang kaai shaike ke saath sandhi kar rakhi thi
 Mao later criticized Stalin, saying that he considered the revolution to be 'fake'
 stalineey leninavaad kii aalochana ke kuch anya pariprekshya bhi hai jinamein urocommunism kaa rukh ullekhneey he
 This version of Marxism assumes that Leninism is not relevant to the struggle of the European proletariat mainly due to the Russian conditions
 iske pairokaar maanate hai ki poonjeewaadi rajya ke hinsak takhtapalat kii raajnneeti karne kii bajaay europee sarvhaara apane lakshyon kii prapti ke liye poonjeewaadi rajya-tantra main bhagidaari karke laabh uthaa saktaa he

 This scripture is commonly known as 'tantrashastra'

 Both are nutritious to each other despite being independent
 nigam karm, gyaan tathaa upasna kaa swaroop batalaata he tathaa aagam inke upaybhoot sadhano kaa varnan karata he
 That is why Vachaspati Mishra has derived the derivation of 'agam' in 'tattvavashardi' as follows: Agachanti Budhimarohanti Abhyudayani: Shreyasopaya Yasmatt, Sa Agam:
 aagam kaa mukhya lakshya 'kriya' ke upar he, tathaapi gyaan kaa bhi vivaran yahan kam nahin he

 That is why the worship of Agama is considered to be particularly useful and beneficial in Kali Yuga - Kalau Agamasamati:

 "writes Ribble," will she be able to handle these songs with unflattering arrangements and any vocal influence-inferiority? More importantly, would anyone want to listen to such a performance or song? Does it matter No
 The focus is still on the basic thing
 " Her image and personality are often contrasted with Christina Aguilera
 antertenment vikali ke david brown ne dekha he ki "christina aguilera twachaa or naabhi ko dikhaati to he lekin apane sangeet or vyavhaar main, vah kisi ko aprasann na karne ke prati adhik icchhuk rahati he -- vah ek acchhee ladki he jo buree hone kaa keval naatak karti he

 And the same level of perfection is also expected from the concert stage, beyond the video set

 "spears' nomenclature finally fades when compared, citing Jackson's resolve to include personal and social issues in her work and Madonna's ability to continually redefine the boundaries of socially acceptable content in the industry
 Falls because "where Jackson and Madonna composed their own music about topics of importance, the music 'I Do i want to grow up but the media will not let me, 'or' Here kitty, kitty, i think my underwear like an upbeat version of one of the ballads like worn out his leather pants

 Along with this, geological phenomena are also studied inside geometry
 prithvi ke aakaar tathaa pariman kaa or bhuprishth par sandarbh binduon kii sthiti kaa yatharth nirdhaaran hetu khagoleey prekshanon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This work requires so much precision that subtle changes in longitudes resulting from the movement of poles and errors of the vertical line resulting from the gravity of adjacent mountains have to be noted

 Due to these various aspects of the geometric survey, the detailed study area of geometry now includes the study of the Earth's gravitational field, its effect on the planetary surface and the impact of the gravitational fields of the Sun and Moon on the Earth
 yadhyapi columbus se purv unani-mistre jyotirvid tolimi ke samay main deshaantar tathaa akshanshon vaale nakshe prachlit the or bina deshotaron tathaa akshanshon vaale navik charton kaa bhi prachaar tha, kintu columbus ke samay main hi prithvi kii akruti ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaae hue yatharth nakshon kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav ho gaya tha
 Initially man believed that the earth is a circular or a circular circle consisting of oceans, rivers and mountains, but when the tribes of the Babylonian priests of astronomy noticed that the arrangement of stars in the sky changes when going south and New stars appear and as the number of northern sodden stars decreases, they realize that perhaps the earth is spherical and nothing else Not his page must circumlocutory
 samudravasiyon ne jahaaj ko dur jane ke saath saath use neeche jate bhi dekha, to unhen bhi goleey nahin to pindaakaar prithvi kii kalpana kerani padi hogi, kintu is sabakaa koi pramaan nahin he
 The Earth is spherical, the first enforcement of this opinion being that of Pythagoras or his visitors; But his views were materialistic rather than indefinite on material facts
 arestu ke samay main unaniyon dwaara prithvi ko golakaar mana jane laga tha
 He gave an estimate of the Earth's circumference of 4,00,000 stadiums and said that the Earth is not much bigger than other celestial bodies
 aileggadriya kaa eretosthanij pehla lekhak he, jisane bhuparidhi nirdhaaran kii vidhi bataai
 On the Nile River, the modern Eswon, then popularly known as 'seine', considered it to be located on the Tropic of Cancer and considered the sun to be right there on the north solstice
 vahaan se 5,000 stadium dur aileggendria main, jo usee deshaantar par sthit mana gaya tha, surya shirobindu se bhuparidhi kaa 1 / 50 vaan bhaag dur dekhne main aayaa
 Thus the perimeter of the earth became 2,50,000 stadiums
 tolimi ne apni 'jiography' naamak pustak main bhuparidhi anumaan 1,80,000 stadium diya
 The definition of the stadium may have been different
 bhuparidhi nirdhaaran kii vidhi main sudhaar tabhi sambhav hua jab 17veen 18veen shatabdiyon ke bich prithvi kii akruti naarangi ke marnid, chapati golabh hone kii ashanka jad pakadaney lagi
 Then in Holland, Snail took shelter of the triangulation series instead of measuring
 1696 i0 main peepard ne akshansh nirdhaaran or bhu-tribhujan ke konon ko naapane main doordarshak kaa prayog kiya
 Based on the length he gave a fraction arc, Newton proved by calculation that geomagnetism was the dominant force in moving the Moon in its orbit
 newton or uske samakaleen hygange se bhuganit kaa nayaa yug aarambh hua
 Mainly due to mechanical enlightenment by them and as the Earth's rotation of its axis turned out to be true, the imagination prevailed that the Earth is not spherical but a short axis spheroid, which is flattened at the poles
 is dharna kii pushti khagolgy rishar ke is praayogit pramaan se ho gai ki uski ghadi jo paris main thik chalati thi dakshin america ke samin nagar main dhai minute prati ghanta sust ho jaati thi
 In opposition to this notion, Cassinus of France said that if the Earth is spherical, the distance from the equator to the pole should increase by a fraction of latitude
 kadachit iske vipareet bhi samajha jaay, kyonki pathak ke vichaar se bhukendriya akshansh ek anshvala chaap vah hoga jo bhucendre par ek ansh kaa kone antarit karata he, kintu iske anusaar samaksh prekshan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Observation of astronomical latitudes, which is the angle between the plumb line and equatorial plane, is possible
 dhruvon se jane vaala koi bhi samtal prithvi se dirghavritakar jaisaa pariched kaatega, jisaki vakrata dhruvon par sabase kam or vishuvat par sabase adhik hoti he falat: akshansh ke prati chaap vruddhi sabase adhik dhruvon par hogi
 But the opposite came to light, which made it seem that the Earth is a galaxy
 is prakaar prithvi ko laghvaksh or dderghaaksh samajhane vaale vidwaanon main vivaad chal padaa
 To determine this, the Paris Science Council sent two search teams, one to Peru and the other to Laplénde, whose latitudes were as large as possible
 1743 i0 main in dalo ne jo ek ansh chaap kii maapen deen, unes yah nishkarsh niklaa ki dhruvon par chapataapan 1 / 213 he, jab ki aadhunik maan 1 / 297 he
 This was followed by several measurements of the flatness and arc of the earth to determine the length of the meter
 yantron main sudhaar ke saath-saath pariklan vidhiyon main bhi sudhaar hue, jinamein gouse kaa nunatam varg siddhant atyant mahatvapurn he
 This method was widely used by the German astronomer Basel
 parishkrut prekshan vidhiyon or parishuddhi ke ucch maanakon kaa sutarapaat karne main ve agrani the
 Astronomical instruments come in handy for astrology work of ground surveying
 deshaantar gyaat karne ke liye yamyottar yantra atyant pracheen kaal se upyog main aata rahaa he
 Now the automatic micrometer is installed in this instrument and it is used with time recorder
 ankshash nirdhaaran ke liye shirobindu doorabeen yaa bhang doordarshak yaamyantar yantra kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Such theodolites are used for the determination of azimuth and for measuring the angles of the angles, which are more subtle and accurate than those used in the general survey
 or adhik yatharthata kii prapti ke liye kitni hi maapen, yantra ke kshaitij vrutt par samaanath: vitarit vinduon se nirdisht pind par, disht kar lee jaati he
 Thus calibration errors can be avoided
 tribhujan main bhujaayen teen-chaar kilometre kii rahen to acha he
 If it is less then the number of measurement errors increases
 pahari sthal par 300 kilometre tak kii duuri par bhi spasht-drishyata rahati he
 In principle any distance can be determined only by measuring the base measured on one side and the angles at its ends
 is prakaar uttarotar keval konon ke maapan se hi koi bhi duuri gyaat kii ja sakati he, kintu vyavhaar main is prakaar pariklit kisi kisi duuri ko samaksh bhi maap liya jaataa he, jisase kone maapan kii yatharthata kii jaanch hoti rahati he
 Nowadays, distance is measured in front of a wire or lace made of alloy and nickel alloy of tin and tin
 is dhaatu par ooshmaa aadi kaa prabhaav upekshniya hota he
 The tension of the wire is also kept standard at the time of measurement
 is prakaar duuri maapan main 10 lakh main 1 tak kii parishuddhta ho jaati he
 In ground survey, land refers to the mean sea level on the sea and the surface designed on the site which is determined by the spirit plane
 yadi samudr se sthal main koi nahar khod di jaay, to jo tal nahar ke pani kaa hoga vahi prithvi tal mana jayega
 There is no mathematical precision in this physical definition because the sea level is also variable due to wind, alkalinity, pressure, heat etc
 prithvital kii ganitiya paribhaasha us samavibhav athwa samaan talawaale, prishth se di jaati he jisapar, prithvi main jitna bhi dravya hai tathaa jahaan bhi hai us sabake gurutvkarshan or aksh ke parit: ghurnan ke kaaran, vibhavafalan achar hota he
 These equipotential surface views will be perpendicular to the direction of gravity, ie, the combined effect of gravity and the rotating centrifugal force, and how many will be in number, the mean of which is closest to the ocean plane is considered to be the earth plane and is called the geosynchronous, or geoid
 Huh
 is shabd main prithvi ke golabh hone kaa bhav antarnihit nahin he
 The only feeling in it is that the Earth is of "earth shape"
 spirittal se binduon kaa jo unnayan miltaa he, vah jeeyoid ke saapeksh hota he, na ki parthiv golabh ke
 For a map, a geoid is considered to be a sphere that is closest to the Earth or any part of it that concerns us
 chunking prithvin purnat: golakaar nahin he, iske vibhinn yamyottareey chaapon ko or unke siron ke akshanshon ko maap kar, in sab prakshanon kaa nunatam varg siddhant, yaa anya kisi aisi vidhi se samanvay kar, prithvi kaa aakaar gyaat kiya jaataa rahaa he is kaary ke liye deshaantareey chaap bhi kaam main aa sakate hai, lekin inkaa maapan vidyut tarasanchaar kaa avishkaar hone par hi santoshjanak yatharthata kaa ho sakaa he or bhu-aakaar kaa nirdhaaran chaap ke bajaay kshetrafal arthath vikshep vidhi se kiya jane laga he
 In this new method, a large area corresponding to the triangulation series is taken, between which a point is chosen by choosing the radius of its longitude, azimuth and the azimuth of a line leading from it and two measurements associated with the geomorphism
 in geodi maanon ke aadhaar par tribhujan shrikhala dwaara parthiv golabh kaa pariklan liya jaataa he
 The irregular deflections of Sahulasutra have always been a puzzle for geologists
 ye khageleey yaa geodic nirdhaaran kii trutiyon se kahin adhik hote hai or apekshtya chote se kshetra ke liye bhi geodic nyaas main samuchit parivartan unhen vishesh se kam nahin kar saktaa
 Therefore, wherever the excess of deflection - mountain basins, plateaus, oceans, etc
 - was initially thought to be caused by visual topographic reasons, the area was left out of the calculation
 baad main jab adhik yatharth sthalakriti tathy uplabdh hue to un sabake prabhaav ke yantric vidhi se pariklan kii baat suujhi
 First the Archdeacon Pratt of Calcutta performed such calculations, although they were extremely laborious
 unhone dekha ki parakalit vikshep prakshepit vikshep se kahin kam tha
 The most satisfactory explanation of this fact was made on the assumption that the mass density below the parts above the earth is less than the average and below the trough is above average
 ganitiya suvidha isamen he ki ghanatv parivartan itnaa maan liy jaay ki bhuprisht se neeche ek vishisht gaharaai par, jise pratikaari gaharaai kehete hai, ekai kshetrafal par jo dravyaman upar kii ore sthit he achar ho
 This hypothesis is called topological retribution and such a system is topological
 samasthiti vidhi ko pehali baar sanyukt rajya par kiye gaye prekshanon main haoard ne prayukt kiya or 1924 i0 main antarrashtriya geodetic or bhubhautikeey sangh ke geodesi anubhag ne puri prithvi ke aakaar ko vah maan liya jo hefrd ne praapt kiya tha
 Later Heise Cannon applied this method to the vertical deflection in Europe and often confirmed the results of Hefford
 chunki prithvi purnat: drudh padaarth kii bani nahin maani jaati or phir usamen aksh ke parit: ghurnan he at: gurutvkarshan or ghurnan janya apkentre bal ke kaaran dhruvon par uski akruti chapate golabh kii he
 As a result, the sight at the poles and equinox is the difference in the measurements and directions of gravity
 lolak dolanon dwaara is antar ko atyant parishuddht: naapakar, pariklan dwaara prithvi kii akruti nirdhaarit ho jaati he
 Also the radius of the earth can also be known, but it is not so accurate
 ye gurutv prekshan anya pariklanon main bhi upyogi siddh hue hai
 The vertical variance in the post-meteorological zone depends on both the astronomical latitude and the geodetic latitude
 inamen geodic akshansh bhi bhu-ghurnan ke kaaran vicharanshil he
 Each body has a shape axis, in which the moment of inertia is the greatest
 yadi ghurnan is aksh ke parit: na ho to, to ghurnanaksh kaa dhruv akruti aksh ke dhruv ke parit: ek band vakr main ghumaa karegaa
