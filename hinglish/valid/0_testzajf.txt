 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year

 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood

 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga

 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he

 As Shri Shivaditya has written in the book Saptapadarthi, doubt is called uncertain knowledge or doubtful experience
 tarksangrah ke anusaar sanshay vah gyaan he jisamen ek hi padaarth anek virdohi dharmo yaa gunon se yukt prathit hota he 
 For example, when we look at a remote pillar in the dark, we cannot know for sure that it is a pillar, then our mind becomes oscillating and we begin to accuse that one of the two different religions of matter and manhood in matter
 na to ham nishchaypurvak yah kah sakate hai ki vah padaarth stambh he or na yah ki vah manushya he
 Such a paradoxical, dichotomous, undecided or alternative state of mind is called doubt
 yah avasthaa na keval gyanabhav tathaa bhram yaa vipareet gyaan se hi kintu yatharth nishcitt gyaan se bhi bhinn hoti he
 Therefore, according to the principle called Skepticism, definite knowledge or its possibility is denied
 is siddhant ko purna rup se maananevaale vyaktiyon ke vicharanusaar maanav ko kabhi bhi or kisi bhi prakaar kaa vaastavik yaa nishchit gyaan nahin ho saktaa
 In the opinion of skeptics, the structure of our brain or mind is such that through it we can never be able to know the true nature of the world or its substances
 sanshaywad ko angl bhashaa main scaptisism kehete hai
 Sapteshism is said to have originated in the year 440 before Christ, from the rationalists called the Sophists of Greece
 parantu unka sanshaywad saamaanya rup kaa tha
 As a systematic theory, it began with the famous thinker of Alice, Piro, three hundred years before Christ
 piro ne vaastavik gyaan ko spasht shabdon main asambhav batalaaya he
 Timon of Philius was his principal disciple
 piro ke kuch anuyaayiyon ne to, jinamein sextus ampiricas kaa naam visheshtya ullekhneey he, sanshayvadi vishwaas ko is seemaa tak nibhaayaa ki ve swayan is baad ko bhi sanshay kii drushti se dekhne lage
 According to these skeptics, all our griefs, compounded by desires and disappointments, originate from the inadequacy of our consultations on matter
 madhyakaalin paashchaatya sanshaywaadiyon main pascal tathaa aadhunik sanshaywaadiyon main hum adhik prasiddh he
 Pascal said that no definite or satisfactory theory of the world can be established by intelligence and Hume sir has limited our ability to know only to the empirical field
 unke anusaar manushya ko apane andriya anubhav ke baahar kii baat jaanane yaa kehane kaa koi adhikaar nahin
 Some thinkers also include the famous German philosopher Chorn in the skeptics; But it is more appropriate to call them agnostic rather than skeptical, because they have revealed the real or conventional nature of things as unknowable or unknowable by intellect, not suspicious
 or kam se kam kaaryjagat ko samaj sakane kii kshamta to unhone buddhi main maani hi he
 The mention of some skeptics of Bharatvarsha is found in some Buddhist texts like "shramaniyaphalasutra" etc
 udaahranarth, ajitkesakambali naamak ek vichaarak kaa kahana tha ki yatharth gyaan kabhi sambhav nahin or gaekwad oriental siries main prakashit "tattavopallavasingh" naamak pandulipi ke lekhak shri jayrashi ne kisi bhi pramaan ko, yahan tak ki pratyaksh pramaan ko bhi, asandigdh gyaan kaa saadhan nahin mana
 Sometimes some people also understand the skepticism of Jain philosophy, propounded by the words "syadasti Syat Nasati"
 parantu vastut: syadwad pratipaadit "syat" shabd kaa prayog tattat vaakya kii sandigdhta kaa nahin kintu use satya kii saapekshata kaa dyotak he
 The truth, condition and context of the advisories or decisions to the taste is acceptable
 chaahe sanshaywaadee swayan kuch bhi kahen, sanshay kii maansik avasthaa koi sukh kii avasthaa nahin hoti 
 And to be completely skeptical is not only difficult, but impossible
 swayan sanshaywad kii sweekruti hi uski manyata kaa khandan kar detii he
 If there is no definite knowledge of any kind, then how can it be said with certainty that any kind of definite knowledge is not possible
 yaa to sanshaywad kii manyata asamichin he yaa phir swayan sanshaywad "vadatovyaghaat dosha" se dooshit siddh hota he
 Additionally, every single function of our practical life depends on the recognition of the definite knowledge of the substance or person concerned
 vah sanshaywad ko purnataya maan lene par chal hi nahin saktaa
 That is why in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the words "sambhayatma Vyasanti" etc
 have made Skepticism inadmissible
 parantu, saath hi saath, yah maanane se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki aparikshit paramparaagat manyataon kii andh sweekruti bhi vichaaron ke vikaas main baadha daalati he
 Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to look at commonly accepted so-called truths for doubt, as enlightened Shri Vachaspati Mishra said, skepticism gives rise to curiosity and curiosity is desirable for knowledge
 or kaant mahoday kii yah ukti ki hum ke "sanshaywad ne mujhe vaicharik roodhiyon kii nidra se jagaa diya", is satya ko pramanit karti he
 But it is exactly the same to color the intellect or mind with a skeptical complexion and doubt everything, as if they are constantly and continuously washed by a lunatic, even when there is no dirt in the hands

 lagbhag 13 veen sadi ke baad se bhartiya upmahadweep ke uttari bhaag main “sant mat” ek deele dhang se judaa guruon kaa ek sahyogi samooh tha jise bahut prasiddhi mili
 His teachings as a religion theology are characterized by a divine doctrine of introvert and love devotion and socially he is associated with an egalitarian doctrine which is against the caste system of Hinduism and Hinduism
 It is also against the difference of Muslim
 sant parampara ko mukhyat: do samoohon main baanta ja saktaa he: punjab, kshetra ke santon kaa uttari samooh jisane apni abhivyakti mukhyat: bolchaal vaali hindi main kii or dakshini samooh jisaki bhashaa puraatan marathi he or jiskaa pratinidhitiv namdev or maharashtra ke anya sant karte hai
 'sant Mat' means 'the path of saints', 'the path of truth', 'the path of right and optimism' or 'opinion of saints'
 The word 'saint' is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'sad' and is used in many ways
 Its original meaning is' one who knows the truth 'or' one who has experienced the ultimate truth
 ' 'sant' shabd se arth aam taur par ek achche vyakti se liya jaataa he lekin iskaa vishesh arth madhyakaalin bharat ke sant kaviyon se hi liya jaataa he
 The Sant Mat movement was not uniform and involved its own socio-religious behavior of saints which was based on the devotion described in the Bhagavad Gita a thousand years ago
 unki apni sajhi kuch roodhiyaan aapas main or un paramparaon ke anuyaayion main bhi sajhi thim jinhen unhone chunauti di thi
 Thus, the saint opinion seems to be such a diverse group of spiritual personalities rather than a specific religious tradition that accepts a common spiritual origin
 is andolan kii seemayen sambhavat: sampradaiwaadee nahin thim or isamen jati or puja-paddati kii brahman avadharanaayen bhi nahin thim
 The saint poets wrote their speech in spoken language which they addressed to the common people in local languages like Hindi and Marathi
 unhone ishwar naam ko sachcha rakshak kaha or dharmik aadambaron ko moolyaheen kah kar khaarij kar diya
 He established the idea that religion is a matter of devotion to God that dwells in the heart
 "
 The first generation of North Indian sages including Kabir and Ravidas were born in Benares in the middle of the 15th century
 Before him, the two main personalities were Namdev and Ramananda in the 13th and 14th centuries
 According to the Sant Mat tradition, Ramananda was a Vaishnava monk who donated names to Kabir, Ravidas and other saints
 ramanandi bhikshuon kii parampara, uske baad ke anya sant or baad ke sikhon dwaara ramanand kii katha ko alag-alag tarah se bataata he
 There is so much information that Ramanand accepted disciples from all castes, a fact which was opposed by orthodox Hindus at that time
 sant mat ke anuyaayi maanate hai ki ramanand ke shishyon ne santon kii pehali peedi taiyaar kii
 These saints developed a culture that was close to the marginalized human beings in the society, which included women, Dalits, untouchables and the extreme
 kuch adhik prasiddh santon main namdev, kabir, nanak, surdaas, mira bai, tulsidas or tukaraam shaamil hai
 
 santon kii panrapara gaiyr-sampradaiwaadee rahi yadhyapi mana jaataa he ki kai sant kaviyon ne apane sampradaay sthapit kiye
 Many of these have saints associated with their names, but their disciples later carried on cults like Kabir Panth, Dadu Panth, Dariya Panth, Advaita Matha, Science of Spirituality and Radhaswamy
 dharmik hinduon ke ek alp samudaay ne hi aupchaarik rup se sant mat kaa anugaman kiya he
 But this tradition has a great impact on all sects and castes
 mira bai jaise beete santon ke bhajan ko bharat or vishwa bhar main hindu jatiyon main kaaphi suna jaataa he

 In ancient times, this combined river had flooded many sites of Rajputana
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki prayag ke nikat tak aakaar yah ganga tathaa yamuna main milakar triveni ban gai thi
 Over time, it disappeared from all these places, yet people believe that in Prayag it still flows intermittently
 manusanhita se spasht he ki saraswati or drushadwati ke bich kaa bhubhag hi brahmavart kehalaata tha
 jai sree ram saraswati nadi puranic hindu granthon tathaa rugveda main varnit mukhya nadiyon main se ek he
 a Mantra of the river Sukta of the Rigveda describes the river Saraswati as flowing 'east of the Yamuna' and 'west of the Sutlej'
 In the later Vedic texts, such as the Tandayas and the Jaiminiya Brahmana, the Saraswati river is described as dry in the desert, in the Mahabharata
 There is also a description of the extinction at a place called 'vinashan' in the desert of Saraswati river
 mahabharat main saraswati nadi ke plakshavati nadi, vedasmriti, vedavati aadi kai naam hai
 In the Mahabharata, Vayupurana etc
 the names and myths associated with various sons of Saraswati are obtained
 mahabharat ke shalya-parv, shanti-parv, yaa vayupurana main saraswati nadi or dadhichi rishi ke putr sambandhi myth thode thode antaron se milte hai unhen sanskrit mahakavi banbhatta ne apane granth 'harshcharit' main vistaar de diya he
 He writes- "once the rains did not happen for twelve years, the sages abandoned the area of saraswati and moved here and there, but Saraswati-son, Saraswatiya did not go anywhere on the orders of Mother
 phir sukaal hone par jab tak ve rishi waapas laute to ve sab veda aadi bhul chuke the
 Keeping his request, Saraswati accepted him as a disciple and got him to recite the Shrutis
 Ashwaghosh has also described the same story in his 'buddhacharit' poetry
 dasvin sadi ke jane maane vidwaan rajasekhar ne 'kavyamimasaa' ke tisare adhyay main kavy sambandhi ek myth diya he ki jab putr prapti kii ichha se saraswati ne himalay par tapasya kii to brahma ne prasann ho kar uske liye ek putr kii rachana kii jiskaa naam tha- kavypurush
 kavypurush ne janm leti hi mata saraswati kii vandana chand vaani main yon kii- he mata!main tera putr kavypurush teri charan vandana karata hoon jiske dwaara samoochaa vaanmay arthrup main parivartit ho jaataa he
 

 " rugveda tathaa anya puranic vaidic granthon main diye saraswati nadi ke sandarbhon ke aadhaar par kai bhu-vigyaani maanate hai ki haryana se rajasthan hokar bahane vaali maujuuda sukhi hui ghagghar-hakaraa nadi pracheen vaidic saraswati nadi kii ek mukhya sahaayak nadi thi, jo 5000-3000 isa purv puure pravaah se bahati thi
 At that time some streams of Sutlej and Yamuna used to come in the Saraswati river
 iske atirikt do anya lupt hui nadiyaan drushtaavadi or hiranyavati bhi saraswati kii sahaayak nadiyaan thim, lagbhag 1900 isa purv tak bhugarbhi badlaav kii vajah se yamuna, sutluj ne apana rasta badal diya tathaa drushtaavadi nadi ke 2600 isa purv suukh jane ke kaaran saraswati nadi bhi lupt ho gayi
 In the Rig Veda, the river Saraswati has been given the title of Naditama
 vaidic sabhyataa main saraswati hi sabase badi or mukhya nadi thi
 Research done by ISRO has shown that this river still flows underground through Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan
 saraswati ek vishaal nadi thi
 The mountains used to break and go through the plains and merge into the Arabian Sea
 iskaa varnan rugveda main baar-baar aata he
 It is described in many circles
 rugveda vaidic kaal main isamen hameshaa jal rahata tha
 Saraswati, like today's Ganges, was one of the largest rivers of that time
 uttar vaidic kaal or mahabharat kaal main yah nadi bahut kuch suukh chuki thi
 Then the water in the Saraswati river was very less
 lekin barsaat ke mausam main isamen pani aa jaataa tha
 Due to the geological changes, the water of the river Saraswati went into the Ganges, many scholars believe that this is the reason why the water of the Ganges was glorified, due to the earthquake, when the land rose up, Saraswati water fell into the Yamuna
 isliye yamuna main saraswati kaa jal bhi pravaahit hone laga
 Only this is why the confluence of three rivers is considered in Prayag, whereas in reality there is no confluence of three rivers
 vahaan keval do nadiyaan hai
 Saraswati never reached Allahabad
 rugveda ke baad ke vaidic sahitya main saraswati nadi ke vilupt hone kaa ullekh aata he, iske atirikt saraswati nadi ke udgam sthal kii 'plaksh prasravan' ke rup main pahchaan kii gayi he, jo yamunotri ke paas hi avasthit he
 According to the description found in the Mahabharata, the Saraswati river originated from a place called Adibadri, slightly above Yamunanagar in Haryana and slightly below the Shivalik hills
 aaj bhi log is sthaan ko tirthasthal ke rup main maanate hai or vahaan jate hai
 But today the river flowing from a place called Adibadri does not go very far, it is called Saraswati, which is seen everywhere like a thin stream
 vaidic or mahabharat kaaleen varnan ke anusaar isi nadi ke kinare brahmavart tha, kurukshetra tha, lekin aaj vahaan jalashay hai
 When the river dries, the ponds or lakes remain wherever the water is deep, and these ponds and lakes are found in a crescent shape
 aaj bhi kurukshetra main brahmasarovar yaa pehwa main is prakaar ke ardhdachandrakaar sarovar dekhne ko milte hai, lekin ye bhi suukh gaye hai
 But these ponds are proof that there was a huge river flowing at that place and after it dried there were huge lakes
 bhartiya puraatatv parishad ke anusaar saraswati kaa udgam uttaranchal main rupan naam ke himand se hota tha
 Rupana Glacier is now also known as Saraswati Glacier
 naitvaar main aakar yah himand jal main parivartit ho jaataa tha, phir jaldhar ke rup main adibadri tak saraswati bahakar aati thi or aage chali jaati thi
 Scientific and geological discoveries have revealed that at some point there was a severe earthquake in the region, due to which the below ground mountains rose up and the water of Saraswati river went backwards
 vaidic kaal main ek or nadi drushadwati kaa varnan bhi aata hai
 It was a tributary of the Saraswati River
 yah bhi haryana se ho kar bahati thi
 Over a period of time when a severe earthquake struck and mountains rose above the ground of Haryana and Rajasthan, the direction of the rivers flow changed
 drushadwati nadi, jo saraswati nadi kii sahaayak nadi thi, uttar or purv kii ore bahane lagi
 This Darshadvati is now called Yamuna, its history is believed to be 4,000 years ago
 yamuna pehle chambal kii sahaayak nadi thi
 Much later it was found in Allahabad by going from the Ganges
 yahi vah kaal tha jab saraswati kaa jal bhi yamuna main mil gaya
 Saraswati used to fall into the sea in the Rigvedic period
 jaisaa upar bhi kaha ja chukaa he, prayag main saraswati kabhi nahin pahunchi
 When the land rose up due to earthquake, the water of Saraswati fell in the Yamuna
 isliye yamuna main yamuna ke saath saraswati kaa jal bhi pravaahit hone laga
 Only this is why the confluence of three rivers is considered in Prayag whereas in geological reality there is no confluence of three rivers
 vahaan keval do nadiyaan hai
 Saraswati never reached Allahabad
 saraswati nadi ke tat par basii sabhyataa ko jise hadappa sabhyataa yaa sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa kaha jaataa he, yadi ise vaidic richaon se hataa kar dekha jaae to phir saraswati nadi maatr ek nadi rah jaaegi, sabhyataa khatm ho jaaegi
 The history of civilization tells that the remains found from the settlements on the banks of the Saraswati river and the story of these relics only connect with the Harappan civilization
 hadappa sabhyataa kii 2600 bastiyon main se vartmaan pakistan main sindhu tat par maatr 265 bastiyaan hai, jabaki shesh adhikansh bastiyaan saraswati nadi ke tat par milti hai
 Till now the Harappan civilization was considered to be the product of the Indus river, but now new research has proved that Saraswati had a great contribution in the construction of Indus civilization
 sookhaa, baadh, chakravaati tufaanon, bhucamp, bhuskhalan, wanon main laganevaali aag, olavrishti, tiddi dal or jwalamukhi fatne jaisi vibhinn prakritik aapadaaon kaa purvanumaan nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he, na hi inhen roka ja saktaa he lekin inke prabhaav ko ek seemaa tak jarur kam kiya ja saktaa he, jisase ki jaan-maal kaa kam se kam nuksaan ho
 This work can be done only when there is competent disaster management support
 prayek varsh prakritik aapadaaon se sarvaadhik prabhavit hone vaale deshon main bharat kaa dasvaan sthaan he
 There are two important internal aspects of disaster management
 vah hai purvavarti or uttarvarti aapadaa prabandhan
 Preoperative disaster management is known as risk management
 aapadaa ke khatre jokhim evam sheeghra chapet main aanevaali sthitiyon ke mail se utpann hote hai
 These factors vary from both time and geographical aspects
 jokhim prabandhan ke teen ghatak hote hai
 This includes hazard identification, hazard mitigation and subsequent disaster management
 aapadaa prabandhan kaa pehla charan he khataron kii pahchaan
 This state involves knowing the nature and knowing the extent of danger related to the characteristics of a particular location
 saath hi isamen jokhim ke aankalan se praapt vishisht bhautik khataron kii prakruti kii soochna bhi samavisht he
 In addition, information and data related to the growing area of impact of the population and the environment associated with such hazards are also part of disaster management
 isamen aise nirnay liye ja sakate hai ki nirantar chalanevaali pariyojnaayen kaise taiyaar kii jaani hai or kahaan par dhan kaa nivesh kiya janaa uchit hoga, jisase durdamy aapadaaon kaa saamana kiya ja sake
 This is how risk management and disaster-appointed professionals work together to estimate risky areas
 ye vyavsaayee aapadaa ke purvanumaan ke aankalan kaa prayaas karte hai or aavashyak ehtiyaat baratate hai
 Manpower, finance and other basic support are part of the sub-branch of disaster management
 aapadaa ke baad kii sthiti aapadaa prabandhan kaa mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 When everything gets disturbed due to the disaster, people have to resettle their own ruined lives and start their day-to-day work again
 aapadaa prabandhakon ko aise prabhavit kshetron main saamaanya jivan behaal karne kaa kaary karnaa padataa he
 Disaster Management serves as the business coordinator
 yah sunishchit karata he ki samast aavashyak sahaayak saadhan or suvidhaayen sahi samay par aapadaagrast kshetra main uplabdh hai, jisase kam se kam nuksaan hota he
 This manager is the head of a group of expert people whose services are essential in times of disaster
 jaise-doctor, nurse, civil ejeeniyar, doorsanchaar visheshgy, vaastushilp, electrician ityadi
 The biggest challenge of disaster management is to assess the disaster-prone border area and the damage caused
 isse is kshetra kaa kaary atyadhik vaigyanik prakriya kaa rup le letaa he
 The challenge increases even more due to the geographical and economic conditions of disaster-hit areas
 aapadaa adhikaar-kshetra kii tamaam simaaen laangh sakati he
 The need to take responsibility for unknown tasks also arises in times of disaster
 aisi sthiti se nipatane ke liye vishesh karmiyon kii jarurat hoti he
 This makes this task more difficult

 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened

 King Dasharatha had three queens: Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 ram kaushalya ke putr the, sumitra ke do putr, lakshmana or shatrughna the or kaikeyi ke putr bharat the
 With the state rules, only the eldest son of a king is eligible to become a king, so Rama was sure to become the king of Ayodhya
 kaikeyi jinhone do baar dasharath kii jaan bachaai thi or dasharath ne unhen yah var diya tha ki wo jivan ke kisi bhi pal unase do var maang sakati he
 Kaikeyi wanted Rama to be king as Raja becoming king and looking to the future, so he granted Rama 14 years of exile by King Dasharatha and demanded the kingdom of Ayodhya for his son Bharata

 While dying, Marich shouted "O Sita! o Laxman!" Made a sound of Sita got worried after hearing that voice and she asked Lakshmana to go to Shri Ram
 Laxman did not want to go, but could not deny his sister-in-law

 Abhinav had such a strong sense of knowledge that for its fulfillment he traveled to Jalandhar outside Kashmir and deeply pursued the principles and worship of the Kaulic faith from Acharya Shambhunath, the head of the Ardhyatrambaka faith
 inhone apane guruon ke naam hi nahin die hai, pratyut unase adhit shastron kaa bhi nirdesh kiya he
 He studied grammar with his father Narasimhagupta, theology of bhutiraj, order and trikadarshan from Lakshmana Gupta, the sound of Bhattendraja, and the study of Natyashastra with Bhatt parrot

 Acharya Abhinavagupta and the situation in Kashmir can be described in the metaphor of a 'sangam-tirtha' in the knowledge tradition of India
 jaise kashmir sampurna bharat kaa ‘sarvajna peeth’ he, vaise hi acharya abhinavgupt sampurna bharatvarsh kii sabhi gyaan-vidhaon evam sadhana kii paramparaon ke sarvopari samaadrut acharya hai

 traditions

 If there is any gland in Indian philosophy, there is an unfounded debate on the former side and the principle side and if Acharya Abhinavagupta has presented his opinion on such a subject, then he can get the decision that is acceptable

 Acharya Jairath, commentator of Abhinavagupta's treatise Tantraloka, calls him 'yoginibhu'
 is rup main to ve swayan hi shiv ke avatar ke rup main pratishthit hai
 The authenticity of the knowledge of Acharya Abhinavagupta is in the context that he took education in many genres of knowledge from the pujardya acharyas-gurus of his period
 unke pitruvar shri narsinghgupt unke vyakaran ke guru the
 Similarly, Lakshmanagupta was a teacher of the epistemology and Shambhunath in the cultivation of his Kaul-sect

, went away into oblivion

 Abhinav studied the order, the triads and the total tantras respectively, and produced the bi-annual texts in this sequence
 is yug kii pradhan rachanaayen ye hai -- bodhpanchadshika, malinivijay karthik, paratrinshikavivaran, tantralok, tantrasar, tantrocchy, tantrovatdhanika

 film vartmaan samay se shuru hoti he
 Devendra, who is an engineer, is going to the railway station with his friend doctor to take his wife and newborn baby in the car at night by storm and rain in the mountain
 raste main bhuskhalan ke kaaran rasta band ho jaataa he to car kaa driver madad lene ke liye jaataa he or donon dost ek puraani haveli main panaah lete hai
 There, the mansion seems familiar to Devendra and he slowly starts to remember the old things
 vah apane doctor dost or haveli ke chaukeedaar ko kahani sunaanaa shuru karata he
 Now the film goes back in time
 anand shyamnagar timber fostate main, jahaan pedo kii kataai kaa kaarobaar hota he, nayaa manager banakar aata he
 There he meets Madhumati, a girl living in the same forests and falls in love with both
 anand apane khaali samay main ek chitrakaar bhi he or vah madhumati kaa chitra taiyaar karne lagata he
 The owner of the business, King Ugranarayan, is a very bad man
 vah madhumati ko apana banane ke liye anand ko baahar kaam se bhej detaa he or dhokhe se madhumati ko apni haveli bula bhejtaa he
 When Madhumati enters the mansion, it is eight o'clock at night
 anand jab laut kar aata he to madhumati ko na paakar badahavaas sa ho jaataa he
 In the forest, Anand's servant Charandas tells him the whole truth
 anand ugranarayan se badla lene ke liye uski haveli jaataa he lekin vahaan ugranarayan ke naukar use maar-maar kar adhamra kar dete hai
 When Ugranarayan's loyalist Bir Singh is going to throw Anand into the ditch, his path is stopped by Madhumati's father Pawan Raja and in the scuffle, both Bir Singh and Pawan Raja are killed and seeing opportunity, Charandas can save Anand goes
 zakhm bhar jane ke baad anand charandas kii madad se rampur dak bangale main rahane lagata he or pagal sa hokar madhumati kaa chitra lekar jangalon main idhar-udhar bhatakane lagata he
 At the same time, he meets Madhavi, a girl from the city, who he mistakenly believes to be Madhumati
 vah madhavi ke peeche-peeche madhumati kaa naam pukaarata hua bhaagta he to madhavi ke saathi uski pitayee karte hai
 But Madhavi finds there a picture of Madhumati made by Anand and she understands that Anand was telling the truth
 ek samaaroh main anand madhavi ko sthaneey libaas main naachte huye dekhtaa he to uske man main ek vichaar aata he
 He goes to King Ugranarayan's mansion and tells him that he needs money to go back home, but he will not beg but make a picture of King Ugranarayana
 raja ugranarayan raji ho jaataa he or anand ko agle din shaam ko aane ke liye kahata he
 He goes to Madhavi and tells him that he came to the mansion of King Ugranarayana at exactly eight o'clock the next day, in the same disguise as the last time Madhumati went to King Ugranarayana's mansion
 madhavi raji ho jaati he
 Anand tells the police his tricks and the police also agrees to accompany him
 agali shaam ko anand raja ugranarayan kii haveli main pahunch jaataa he
 The police hide and stay outside
 bhayankar toofaan or barish kii raat hoti he
 At exactly eight o'clock in the night, Madhavi, who became Madhumati, enters the mansion of King Ugranarayana
 raja ugranarayan dar ke maare sara sach ugal detaa he ki kaise madhumati kii maut huyi
 When madhumati-madhavi tells King Ugranarayana where King Ugranarayana has located his corpse, King Ugranarayana agrees
 tabhi baahar se police aakar raja ugranarayan ko pakad leti he
 At the same time Anand's forehead is how Madhavi knows where the body of Madhumati is located
 or baahar se madhavi yah kehete huye andar daakhil hoti he ki car karaab ho jane ke kaaran vah samay par nahin pahunch saki
 Anand realizes that he has been helped by Madhumati's Ruh and now the same Ruh calls him from the place from where Madhumati fell to his death
 anand bhi uske peeche-peeche jaakar maut ke agosh main samaa jaataa he
 The film then arrives in the present and it is morning to narrate the story to Devendra
 devendra kahata he ki is janam main bhi uski patni vahi he, naam he radha
 Then the driver of his car comes and tells that the path has now opened, but the train from which Radha was coming has crashed
 donon dost turant railway stesan ke liye ravaanaa hote hai or vahaan jaakar dekhte hai ki radha apane bachche ke saath surakshit he
 Devendra goes to Radha and says that he is not with this birth but for many births

85 delha phulpur, elahabaad, uttar pradesh sthit ek gaanv he
 Interaction and exchange of ideas between two or more persons is called an interview
 isamen ek yaa kai vyakti kisi ek vyakti se prashn poochhate hai or vah vyakti in prashnon ke jawaab detaa he yaa in par apni raay vyakt karata he
 Interview is also a genre of literature
 alag-alag uddeshyon se saakshaatkaar liye jate hai
 The interview process also varies according to the purpose
 saakshaatkaar bahut tarh ke ho sakate hai- Interview has been in circulation for personnel selection in industries
 yah ek pracheenatam evam sarvamaanya vidhi ke rup main prayukt hota aayaa he
 In the present era, interviews are used as a mandatory tool in all fields
 yah ummidavaar tathaa uski anukulata ko jaanch-parakhane kii ek jivant saamaajik sthiti he
 It has two sides
 in pakshon ke bich kii vaarta hi antim nirnay kaa aadhaar banati he
 Bingham and Moore consider the interview a purposeful dialogue
 inhone saakshaatkaar ko ek aisa chitra mana jiske dwaara saakshatkaraarthi ko kaary vishesh ke yogya athwa ayogy ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 At the present time there have been many changes regarding the variation of the purpose of the interview
 bhinnata ke aadhaar par saakshaatkaar kabhi chayan, kabhi manovriti, kabhi salaah to kabhi moolyankan aadi hua karata he
 Whiteless considered the interview to be a direct conversation between the applicant and the serving office bearers
 vartmaan main saakshaatkaar keval soochna prapti kaa hi saadhan nahin balki maapan kaa bhi pradhan saadhan ban gaya he
 Currently, many of its objectives have been revealed as a method of determining business compatibility
 vartmaan samay ke sandarbh main saakshaatkaar kii bhoomika ek shikshak tathaa saakshatkaraarthi ke vyavhaar main prachlankartta evam vaartalap ke sukomal protsaahanakartta ke rup main ubharne lagi he
 The interview method has the advantage that applicants are not able to give incorrect responses easily
 saakshaatkaar kii paristhiti yadi sugathit hoti he to yah ek utprerak kaa bhi kaam kar sakati he
 This is the only source of information
 saakshaatkaar ke samay aavedak yah sanket khojataa rahata he ki baatcheet se us par kya prabhaav pad rahaa he or saakshaatkaarkartta uske bare main kyasoch rahe ho? in sanketon dwaara aavedak ko prabalikaran miltaa he
 Each of his next behavior begins to be specified by this explanation
 kahn tathaa kennel ne saakshaatkaar ke abhipreranaatmak pahalu ko vishesh mahatva diya he
 He said that these conditions are necessary for the success of the interview- yadi saakshaatkaar ke dauraan ye sharten prashn nirmaan, vaastavik sanchaalan, ummidavaar ke maansik str, uski tatparta or bhaag lene kii ichha aadi vividh staron par puri ho jaati he to iske falswaroop diya gaya maapan or nirnay bhi bejod hoga
 a successful interviewer is also patient with the soft-spoken
 sari suchanaaen saakshaatkaarkartta se hokar hi guzarati he
 Therefore, it is the religion of the interviewer to collect work information, weigh the information signals, coordinate them properly and finally reach the decision about the selection of the applicant
 saakshaatkaar kii rachana vaartalap se hi hoti he
 Therefore, its success will also be determined by the negotiating skills of both sides
 kisi apratyaashit ghatana ke dwaara kabhi-kabhi saakshaatkaar ke dauraan sthapit anubandh bighad jaye to aisi sthiti main punah nae sire se santulan khojane kii sthiti aa jaati he
 Interviews have also come to have medical use in industries
 sabhi jagah sanrachit saakshaatkaar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 At present, there has been a tremendous change in the principles and practice of interviewing
 symonds ne saakshaatkaar kii safalataa hetu chaar karkon ko mahatva diya he- The ultimate success of the method depends on the fact that if the employee protection, respect for the privacy of others and the information received are used properly, then the interview method can prove to be invaluable heritage for the study of industrial problems
 saakshaatkaar vidhiyon main trutiyon ke kaaran is pranali main puraa bharosa karnaa kathin he
 It is clear from the observation that considerable differences are seen by various interviewers in evaluating the candidates
 saakshaatkaar ek sarvaadhik aatmanishth vidhi he
 Since the evaluations do not have consistent conformance, this method cannot be considered reliable
 jo vidhi vishwasaneey nahin he, vah satya hone kaa daawa bhi nahin kar sakati he
 Scott, Halingworth and Vangar etc
 studied it
 sabhi ne is vidhi kii vishwasaneeyata par bharosa purna roopen nahin kiya he
 Some of the major interview errors are as follows - adhikansh saakshaatkaarkartta anjaane main vyarth kii baton ke prati purv sthapit anukulit pratikriyaaon se prabhavit hote hai
 Such as the candidate's voice, manner of speaking etc
 anukulit pratikriya main har vyakti apni pasandgi, naapsandgi vyakt karata he kintu vah is baat se avgat nahin rahata ki use kis prakaar vishisht vyavhaar ruchikar tathaa aruchikar prathit hote hai
 There is a belief of the person that the candidate will reveal his habit at the time of interview
 lekin manovaigyanik rup se iskaa koi thos aadhaar nahin he
 Therefore it is difficult to arrive at a decision as a result of a belief in a generalized habit
 saakshaatkaarkartta ko is prakaar kii aadaton se mukt rahane kii cheshtaa kerani chahie anyathaa iske nirnay doshapurn ho sakate hai tathaa saare chayan kaary par vipareet prabhaav pad saktaa he
 The interviewer tries to keep himself as free from bias as possible
 lekin har sambhav eemaandaaree ke baavjood kuch aisi achetan manovriti rakhata he jiske falswaroop vastuon, vyaktiyon tathaa ghatnaon ke prati uskaa pratyakshikaran or vyavhaar vishesh roopen prabhavit hotahai
 Therefore, the interviewer Purnarupane cannot claim to be free from these earlier planets
 saakshaatkaar ke samay aavedak purnatah unmukt na rahakar adhikansh bhaybheet dikhte hai
 It is also possible that a candidate is not able to put his / her qualifications and ideas in the right form before the board
 iske vipareet durbal aavedak baar-baar saakshaatkaar dene ke kaaran board ko prabhavit kar lete ho
 The success of the interview does not depend only on the merit and achievement of the candidate, but on the cleverness and skill to face such situations
 yogya vyakti bhi saakshaatkaar kii kala main praveen na hone par asafal rahata he
 Thus the interview system cannot be trusted completely
 isamen vyakti dusron ke vyavhaaron tathaa shishtacharon kaa anukaran karata he
 This tendency is seen again and again at the time of interview because the candidate inadvertently tries to establish his identity by imitating him due to the high position of the interviewer
 saakshaatkaarkartta ke mitrataa vyakt karne par aavedak main bhi aisi pratikriyaayein utpann hone lagati hai
 These exemplary tendencies are taken incorrectly
 faltah saakshaatkaar main iske nirnay bhi ayatharth hote hai
 Probably the biggest source of errors in interviews is not to explain the meaning of pointless glossaries
 saadharantah saakshaatkaarkarttaaon ko ummidavaaron ke shilgunon se sambandhit koi suchi nahin di jaati he
 Even if this list is given, they are rarely defined clearly
 swabhaavatah vyaktigat nirnay tathaa vyakhyaaon ke liye rasta adhik khul jaataa he, jiske kaaran ummidavaar ke chayan ke prashn par saakshaatkaarkartaaon main ghor matbhed ho jaataa he
 The probability of decision related inaccuracies increases
 lekin mahatvapurn baat yah he ki uparokt kathinaaiyon ke baavjood bhi saakshaatkaar kii lokapriyata kam nahin hoti he
 In this process of mutual face-to-face, many valuable secrets related to the personality and behavior of the candidate can also be inaugurated
 saakshaatkaar ek aisa madhyam he jiske dwaara ummidavaaron ko unke bhaavon tathaa vichaaron ko maukhik rup se abhivyakt karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 It is a useful system, but there are mainly two types of difficulties in declaring it as a useful selection system - in kathinaaiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sudhaar sambandhi suzav nimna ho sakate hai- The efficiency of the interviewer is based on the success of the interview
 isliye aavashyak he ki saakshaatkaar samiti ke sadasyon kaa chayan saavdhaneepurvak karnaa chahie
 The interviewer must be qualified
 usamen pratyakshikaran kii tikshnata, parivartanshiltaa, samaayojanshiltaa tathaa vividh saakshaatkaar lene kaa anubhav hona chahie
 He should also get specialized training in interview art
 iske bina saakshaatkaarkartta saakshaatkaar ko safaltaapurvak sampann nahin kar saktaa he
 At the time of interview, they should be trained to adopt the same system and follow the same code of conduct
 bingham tathaa moore ne bhavi saakshaatkaarkartaaon ke prashikshan hetu nimna paraamarsh die hai- There should be an objective method for the measurement of transcendental properties
 iske liye pramanik moolyankan maandand kaa prayog apekshit he
 The more subdivisions shown in the criterion, the greater the veracity of the decision
 shilgunon kii suchi ko anubhav dwaara, karmchaaree prabandhakon dwaara va paryvekshakon dwaara yaa to agrim rup se taiyaar kar lenaa chahie athwa suchi kaa nirmaan kaary vishleshan paddati dwaara hona chahie
 The formulation of the questions should not be defective, which causes the candidate to have trouble understanding its meaning
 saakshaatkaar main saamaajikprashnon kaa poochna vaanchhneeya he jo icchit shilgunon se sambhddha hon
 Interviewers should be divided into different groups
 prayek ummidavaar ke samaksh ek samooh kam se kam ek baar avashya saakshaatkaar kare
 Decision inaccuracies can be reduced by this
 saath hi saakshaatkaar kii vishwasaneeyata bhi bad sakati he
 While useful, this suggestion is rarely used in practical terms
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki saakshaatkaar main vaise hi samay adhik lagata he, jo or bad jaayegaa
 Interview is not just exchange of views
 saakshaatkaar main saakshatkaarthi ke bahya vyavhaaron ko bhi protsaahan milanaa chahie
 In this case, the interview works like behavioral or situational tests
 aadhunik manovaigyanikon ne apane anubhavon ke aadhaar par yah vichaar vyakt kiya he ki saakshaatkaar vidhi main vastunishth padon ko sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 The method of assigning marks can also be adopted similar to this
 saakshaatkaar main prayukt padon ke pramanikaran hetu prayek ummidavaar se ek hi tarah ke prashn kiye jaayen to isse saakshaatkaar kaa uddeshy puraa nahin ho paata he
 Interview is a method of mutual dialogue in which new ideas and thoughts are generated in the conversation
 lekin baatcheet kii disha kii purna bhavishyavaanee karnaa kathin hota he
 To make the interview authentic, a standardized copy of the list should be given to the members of the committee so that it can be treated accordingly
 is suchi main vaanchit shilgunon kii suchi ko agrim banaakar ummidavaar se milane vaale gunon ko hi chihnit karte hai
 This is called the 'interview-employee evaluation form'
 gean naamak vidwaan ne saakshaatkaar ke liye nimna vyaavhaarik suzav die hai- If the right methods are adopted in the interview, then it can be made an important means of professional selection

 Australia and New Zealand had also bid for the competition and a successful Australasian bid for the 2011 World Cup could result in a 50-50 split in the game, with the final match deal still remaining
 The bid by Trans Tasman, Beyond Borders, was the only bid for 2011 that reached the ICC headquarters in Dubai ahead of the March 1 deadline

 haalanki, jab matdaan kaa samay aayaa to asia ne teen maton kii tulana main saat mat praapt karke mejabani kaa adhikaar jeet liya
 The Pakistan Cricket Board revealed the fact that it was the deciding vote of the West Indies Cricket Board which changed the whole issue as it supported the bidding of Asia with four bidding countries, including South Africa and Zimbabwe
 pakistani akhbaar don main yah khabar di gayi ki asian deshon ne 2007 vishwa cap ke dauraan west indian cricket ke liye kosh ekatrit karne kaa vachan diya he, jisane matdaan kii prakriya ko prabhavit kiya
 However, the chairman of the Asian dialect supervision committee, I
S
 Bindra said that he had 40 crore U
S
 dollars in the region
 The promise of additional dollar gains was the reason for the change of vote and it was "not done in return for their support", as well as "that the West Indies had nothing to do with the World Cup bid"

 India won the final vote as they argued in their favor that they should have more opportunities to host the World Cup as their group of nations is larger

 Later in 2007, the four nations agreed to a new revised format for the 2011 World Cup, similar to the 1996 World Cup, with the only difference being that the number of teams participating in 1996 was 12, while in 2011 The number of participating teams increased to 14

 On 17 April 2009, the ICC withdrew the right to jointly host the World Cup from Pakistan, due to ongoing concern over the "precarious security arrangements" prevailing there, especially in the wake of the 2009 terrorist attacks in Lahore during Sri Lanka's visit
 This happened as a result
 pakistan cricket board ne yah sanket die ki yadi unase bharat main khilne ko kaha gaya to vah vishwa cap main hissaa lene se inkaar sakate hai
 However, there is no concrete evidence as to whether this will actually happen
