 He also wrote on many untouched subjects, poets are discovered and their talent is seen in historical essays
 babu shyaam sundar das kii bhashaa shuddh saahitiyik hindi he, jisamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he
 In relation to the language, his idea was - 'when we accept foreign words with foreign expressions, then make them so that the foreignness comes out of them and they become disciplined by our grammar rules
 ' isliye jahaan kahin unhone apni bhashaa main 'urdu' ke prachlit shabdon kaa prayog kiya he, vahaan unka urdupan nikaal diya he, kalam, kavayad, kanoon aadi shabdon ke neeche kii bindi hataakar or unke uccharan badal kar unhone unka prayog liya he
 Similarly, by removing the rarity of Sanskrit words, they are written in Hindi in a simple way - like work in place of work, anjan in place of anjan
 shabd chayan ke bare main babu shyamsundar das kaa mat tha- 'sabase pehla sthaan shuddh hindi ke shabdon ko, uske peeche sanskrit ke sugam or prachlit shabdon ko, iske peeche farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke saadhaaran or prachlit shabdon kaa or sabase peeche sanskrit ke aprachlit shabdon ko sthaan diya jaae
 Never use difficult words in foreign languages like Persian

 Due to the intensity and dryness of the subject it is somewhat dry and devoid of style
 is prakaar kii style kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- 'this life struggle is beginning to seem even more intense and painful due to the attrition of two different civilizations
 is avasthaa ke anukool hi jab sahitya utpann hokar samaaj ke mastishk ko protsaahit or prati kriyman karegaa tabhi vaastavik unnati ke lakshan dekh padenge or uskaa kalyankari fal desh ko aadhunik kaal kaa gaurav pradaan karegaa
 Decoration of ornaments is not found in any type of style of Babu Shyam Sunderdas

 To explain his ideas well, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has repeated the same thing with the words' Summary is' or ',' such as' etc

 ramchandra shukla ne hindi sahitya kaa itihaas main likhaa he : Shyam Sundar Das was not only an institute-maker, but was also unmatched in management
 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie
 Prior to Shyam Sundar Das there was a particularly critical time for Hindi and Nagari script
 pratap narayan mishra ne kai sthanon par hindi ke prachaar ke liye sabhaayen sthapit kii thim
 One such meeting was established in 1884 in Prayag under the name of 'hindi Savarni Pratik Madhya Bharat Sabha'
 sarkari dacrataron main nagari ke pravesh ke liye bhaaratendu harishchandra ne bhi kai baar udhyam kiya, par unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Despite this, the effort continued
 adalati bhashaa urdu hone ke kaaran navshikshiton main urdu padhane waalon kii sankhya adhik thi, jisase hindi pustakon ke prakaashan kaa kaary aage nahin bad paata tha
 In addition to this literature-crisis, the entry of Nagari into the government offices was a grave crisis in front of people who knew it
 isi daur main kuch utsaahi chaatro ke udyog se, jinamein babu shyaam sundar das pramukh the, 1893 main kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha kii sthapana kii gayi
 Here too, remember the statement of Ramchandra Shukla that, 'tell me the truth, all the prosperity and fame of this gathering is the fruit of Babu Shyam Sundar Das's sacrifice and continuous hard work
 ve aadi se ant tak iske pranaswaroop sthit hokar baraabar ise anek bade udyogon main tatpar karte rahe
 Its first chairman was Bharatendu's brother-in-law Radhakrishna Das

 From the Tantric point of view, the light of knowledge comes from the experience that the two theories that seem opposite are actually one; Along with passive concepts of emptiness and wisdom, active compassion and measures should also be conceptualized

 computer networks main, downlod karne kaa arth he kisi duurastha system se kisi sthaneey system par data praapt karnaa yaa aisa koi data antaran prarambh karnaa
 Webserver, FTP server, email server, or other similar systems, etc
 are some remote systems from which one can be downloaded
 ek downlod kaa arth dowloding ke liye prastut kii gai yaa downlod kii ja chuki koi file athwa is prakaar kii kisi file ko praapt karne kii prakriya ho saktaa he
 It is becoming more common to mistakenly consider the meaning of 'downloading' and 'installing' as one or confusing their meaning or incorrectly tying them together
 isaki vipareet kriya, apaloding, kisi sthaneey system se kisi duurastha system, jaise kisi sarwar yaa kisi anya claayent, par data ko bhejne ke kaary ko, jiskaa uddeshy sthanantarit kiye ja rahe data kii ek prati us duurastha system par sanchit karnaa hota he, athwa is prakaar kii kisi prakriya kii shuruyaat ko sanderbhit kar sakati he
 With the increasing popularity of bulletin board systems, the term became popular among computer users for the first time and in the 1970s, the widespread distribution and implementation of dial-up access proved to be helpful
 apaloding or dowloding shabdaawaliyon ke prayog main aksar yah sammilit hota he ki bheja yaa praapt kiya ja rahaa data sthaayee rup se sanchit kiya janaa he, athwa kam se kam asthaayee se kuch adhik rup main sanchit kiya janaa he
 In contrast, the term downloading is different from the concept of streaming, which refers to the receipt of data that is to be used immediately after the data has been received, while the transfer is still ongoing and can be performed over a long period of time
 Is not stored, whereas in the process described by the word downloading, it will be included that the data can only be used when it is completely Have been Rapt
 strimming media yaa brouzar main pradarshit media prastut karne vaali websites, jaise utyub, tathaa aisi websites, jo prayoktaaon ko in samagriyon ko praapt karne ke baad apane computers par sanchit karne kii kshamta nahin deteen, ke dwaara yah kehane kaa chalan badhata ja rahaa he ki dowloding kii anumati nahin he
 In this context, the term "download" specifically includes "receive and store" rather than simply "receive"
 haalanki, yah yaad rakhana bhi mahatvapurn he ki "dowloding" or "antaran" donon ek samaan nahin hai 
 When applied to local transfers, it is often difficult to determine whether it is an upload or download because both the source and the destination are under the local control of the system user
 takneekee rup se, antaran ko prarambh karne ke liye yadi prayokta data ko praapt karne vaale upkaran kaa prayog karata he, to yah ek downlod hoga or yadi unhone prakriya ko prarambh karne ke liye data ko bhejne vaale upkaran kaa prayog kiya ho, to yah ek aplod hoga
 haalanki, chunki adhikansh gaiyr-takneekee prayokta kisi bhi data antaran ko sanderbhit karne ke liye downlod shabd kaa hi prayog karte hai, atah is sanshay ko dur karne ke liye kabhi-kabhi sabhi sthaneey antaranon ko sammilit karne ke liye "sidlod" shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This process is called "remote uploading" when data is being transferred from a remote system to another remote system
 iskaa prayog kuch online file hosting sevaaon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Remote uploading is also used in situations where computers that need to share data are located on a high-speed remote local area network, and remote control is performed by a relatively low-speed dialup modem connection
 Ho
 udaahranarth: Without remote uploading functionality, the user must first download the file to their local host and then upload it again to the remote file hosting server
 jahaan duurastha computer ke saath sangyojan ek dyaap conection ke madhyam se ho rahaa ho, vahaan sthaneey rup se downlod karne or phir punah aplod karne main lagane vaala samay second se lekar ghanton yaa dinon tak bad saktaa he

 For those who are not programmers, it is very much used as a 'find and Replace'
 nimnlikhit udhaaharan kuch aisi visheshtaon ko spasht karte hai, jinhen regular oxpraishan main abhivyakt kiya ja sake: Regular expressions can be even more complex than these examples: Regular expressions have been used by many text editors to search for and customize textual patterns based on usability and patterns in the programming of languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, Perl, Ruby or Tcl shashakt regular oxpraishan engine unke vaakya vinyas main bana hua he
 Many of the utilities offered by Unix distributions - editor ed and filter grep - were the first to popularize the concept of regular expressions
 vaakya rachana ke ek udhaaharan ke rup main, regular oxpraishan \ bex kaa prayog "shabd simaaon" ke baad aane vaale "ex " string ke sabhi udaahranon kii khoj ke liye ho saktaa he
 In superficial terminology, \ bex will find its corresponding string "ex" in two possible fields, at the beginning of words and between two characters in a string, one of which is a word character and the other is not a word character
 
 is prakaar, string main "texts for experts", \ bex "exparts" main to "ex " ke saath mail khaataa he, lekin "texts" main mail nahin khaataa 
 Many modern computing systems provide wildcard characters to match filenames to a file system

 Regular expression, also often referred to as a pattern, is a pointer that describes in detail a set of strings
 unka upyog aamtaur par tatwon kii suchi banaae bina set ke bare main sankshep main bataane ke liye hota he
 For example, 'set' which consists of three strings "handel", "händel" and "haendel" can be described as h ndel's pattern
 In most formalisms, if a regex matches a particular set, it should be known that there are an infinite number of such indicators
 adhikansh akaarwaad nimnlikhit kriyaaon ke liye regular oxpraishan banaati hai
 "gray" or "gray" matches with | gray
 |grey or gry samroop patterns hai, jo "gray " or "grey " donon hi set ko varnit karte hai
 For example, ab * c matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc" and so on

 pattern milan: itihaas bhi dekhen Regular expression can be defined as formal language theory
 regular oxpraishan main sthiraank or operators hote hai, jo strings ke sets in seton par kriyashltaaon ko kramshah suchit karte hai
 The following definitions are standard and found in most textbooks of formal language theory
 Given a bounded alphabet Σ, the following constants are defined: nimnlikhit sankriyaayein paribhaashit hai: | denotes α in r and β in S}
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}{"d", "ef"} = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}
 | s which indicates the alliance of r and S
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}|{"ab", "d", "ef"} = {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}
 To avoid parentheses, it has been assumed that clean star has the highest priority, followed by a combination and then a set alliance
 If there is no doubt, parentheses may be omitted
 udhaaharan ke liye, c ko abc or a|) ko a|bc* jaisaa bhi likhaa ja saktaa he
 Many textbooks use ∪, +, or ∨ signs for combination instead of perpendicular bars

}
 |b)* khaali string: {ε, {0}a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa,

 Languages are the standard example here
 Lk varna {{0}a,b } par jiskaa antim akshar k a kii barabari apane sabhi strings sahit karata he
 On the one hand, the regular expression describing l 4 is given by ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^ {*} a}

 As seen from the examples, various regular expressions can express the same language: formalism is unnecessary
 kalanvidhi main lekhan sambhav he jo die gaye regular oxpraishan ke madhya yah nirnay karne ke liye ki ullikhit bhashaaen anivaary rup se ek samaan hai ki nahin
 yah prayek abhivyakti ko nunatam niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin kii had tak kam kar detaa he or nirdhaarit karata he ki kya ve samakritik samakaksh hai yaa nahin
 To what extent can this redundancy be removed? Can we find an interesting subset of regular expressions that are fully suggestive? An alliance of clean stars and sets is obviously necessary, but perhaps we can ban their use

 IEEE POSIX basic regular oxpraishan maanak khaskar ulti anukulata ke liye paramparaagat vaakya-vinyas ke saath ise dizine kiya gaya, kintu isane ek saamaanya maanak uplabdh karaayaa jise kai Unix regular oxpraishan upkarnon ke vyatikram vaale vaakya-vinyas ke rup main apana liya gaya he, haalanki isamen ab bhi aksar kuch vividhtaayen athwa atirikt visheshtaayen dikhaai detii hai
 There are several tools that support ERE syntax with command line topics
 BRE vaakya-vinyas main, adhikansh aksharon ko shabdic arth main liya jaataa he -- ve aapas main ek duusare se mail khate hai 
 neeche soochibaddh apwaadon ko aksharon se pare yaa anukramon se alag kaha jaataa he
 Examples: aksharon se pare kaa arth bekaslash se bachakar kuch aksharon ke liye POSIX vistrut regular oxpraishan ke vaakya-vinyas main vipareet he
 In this syntax itself, a backslash causes meta characters to be treated as literal characters
 atah udhaaharan ke liye, \ ab he or \ { \ } ab { }
 saath hi saath, pichley sandarbhon ke liye ko hataa liya gaya he or nimnlikhit aksharon se pare ko shaamil kiya gaya hai: Examples: |dog "cat " yaa "dog " ke saath mail khaataa he
 POSIX extended regular expressions can often be used with modern Unix applicability by including the command line flag -E
 chunki aksharon kii anek vargeekrut shreniyan chune hue sthaneey setting, POSIX maanak aksharon kii kuch shreniyon athwa virgon ko nimna talika main dikhaaya gaya he: POSIX character categories can only be used within parentheses
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab] ucchvarg ke bade aksharon evam chote aksharon "a " or "b " ke saath hi mail khaataa he
 In Perl's regular expression, coincides with and combines with
 ek atirikt gaiyr-posix shrenee ko kuch upkarnon ke dwaara samajha gaya he vah he, jise aamtaur par plus rekhankan underscore ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 This raises the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that can be used as identification marks
 sampadak Vim aage verde or verde-head shrenee ke bich antar spasht karte hue pahchaan bataate hai 
 chunki kai programing bhashaaon main jo akshar pahchaan chihn ke rup main aarambh kar sakate hai ve unke samaan nahin hai, jo anya sthiti main upasthit ho sakate hai
 It is noted that POSIX regular expression standards call character classes in the color of other regular expressions, which support them, they are commonly referred to as POSIX character classes
 adhikansh anya regular oxpraishan flavors ke saath kairactor claces pad-bandha kaa prayog POSIX nirdhaarit koshthak suchakon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Perl has a more consistent and rich syntax than POSIX Basic and Extended Regular Expression Standards
 isaki nirantarata kaa ek udhaaharan he ki \ hameshaa gaiyr-varnankit aksharon se alag bhaagta he
 Another example of functionality is possible with Perl, but not with POSIX - the subsequent regular expression concept of sluggish quantification
 vyapak rup se apni suchak kshamta ke kaaran kai anya prayojyata or programing kii bhashaaon ne vaakya-vinyas ko Perl kii hi tarah apana liya he -- udhaaharan ke liye, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework or w3c's XML Schema sabhi regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas kaa prayog Perl kii hi tarah karte hai
 Some languages and tools such as Boost and PHP support multiple regular expression flavors
 Perl vyutpann regular oxpraishan ke karyanvayan main ekarupata nahin he or kuch keval Perl kii visheshtaon ke subset ko hi karyanvit karte hai
 The process of Perl 5
10 has reached Perl corporate syntax extensions with its completeness and breadth - originally from Python, PCRE, 
NET Framework and Java
 saral regular oxpraishan aisa vaakya-vinyas he, jinka prayog computer aplication program ke aitihaasik sanskarnon main kiya ja saktaa he evam apane antargat kuch anuprayogon ke dwaara sahyog bhi paa saktaa he
 It has been deemed inappropriate for the purpose of providing previous conformity
 regular oxpraishan main maanak parimaapak laalchee hai arthath ve jitna mail kha sakate hai adhik se adhik utani baar mail khate hai, baaki ko rijex ke saath koi nayaa mail khaane ke liye chhod dete hai
 For example, someone new to regexes who wants to find the first instance between a single item can find between the symbols in this example
 ek or whale explozan, ko ghatit hua
 


 who would like to come with the pattern or similar
 However this pattern would actually like to go back to "" instead of "", which was expected, because * quantification is greedy - so it would want to consume as many characters as possible from input, and "january 26>, "will have more characters than" January 26 "
 haalanki is samasya ko kai tareekon se taala ja saktaa he, aadhunik regular oxpraishan upkaran ek parimank ko sust ke rup main vaishishty paane kii anumati dete hai parimank ke baad ek prashnchihn lagaakar kiya jaataa he, athwa sanshodhak kaa prayog kar jo parimank ke laalach ko ulat detaa he 
 sust parimank kaa prayog kar suchak sabase pehle kam se kam mail khaane kii koshish karte hai
 Although slack mail is used in the preceding example to select one of the results of multiple matches, in some cases it can also be used for better performance, when greedy matching needs to backfire
 
 avyavasthit bhashaaon ke liye pattern aadhunik regular oxpraishan sangrahon se praapt kai visheshtaayen suchak kshamta pradaan karti he jo suvyavasthit bhashaaon se bhi adhik ho jaati he
 For example, many implementations allow the grouping of subindexers and reminds the value of matching in the same indicator
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek pattern duhraaye gaye shabdon kii ladiyon se mail kha saktaa he, jaise ki "papa " athwa "wikiwiki ", jise aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant main squares kehete hai
 The pattern for these battles is \ 1
 haalanki, squares kii bhashaa suvyavasthit nahin he
 Nor is it free from the subject
 back refrences kii aseemit sankhyaon pattern ke saath mail khaataa, jaise ki aseemit sankhya main aadhunik upkaran dwaara samarthit, en pi-sampoorn he 
 However, many tools, libraries and engines that provide such structures still use regular expression terminology for their patterns
 isane regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa namakaran kiya he, jiske aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant tathaa pattern ke kai bhinn arth hai
 For this reason, some people use regex or simply pattern terminology to interpret the latter
 parl programing bhashaa ke lekhak, laire wal ek niabandh main parl 6 ke dizin ke bare main likhte hai: There are at least three different Kalaan methods, algorithms that determine how a given regular expression matches a string
 sabase puraane or sabase tej parinaam par nirbhar do aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant jo prayek garaniyatatmak parimit sthiti yantra ko niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin main roopantarit karnaa sweekaar karata he
 DFA can be explicitly constructed and then consequently operates on the input one symbol at a time
 ek regular oxpraishan ke aakaar ke liye DFA kaa nirmaan "O" kii keemat par karne par samay or smriti aa jaati he, lekin yah n aakaar ke string par hi o samay main chal saktaa he
 An alternative effort is to emulate the NFA directly, essentially creating each DFA position on demand and then dropping it out, possibly caching on the next step
 This keeps DFA implicit and the exponential cost of manufacture can be avoided, but the running cost increases to O
 is spasht padakshep ko DFA kalanvidhi kehete hai or antarnihit padakshep ko NFA kalanvidhi
 jaise ki ek samaan DFA ko kriyanvit karne main donon ko bhinn tareekon se dekha ja saktaa he, unhen bhi bina bhed-bhav ke aksar kalanvidhi kehete hai
 These algorithms are fast, but their use for returning grouped subheads is a tricky quantification and complicates similar features
 teesri kalanvidhi back trek ke dwaara pattern ke saath input string ke milan ke liye he
 This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but the terminology is unclear
 iskaa chalan samay ghaataanki ho saktaa he, jiskaa saral karyanvayan yah ujagar karata he ki jab suchakon ke khilaaf milan jaise ki *b jisame prayaavartan or aseemit parimann donon hi hai
 Emphasize the algorithm to consider the increasing exponential number of substitute cases
 More complex implementations often mark and speed up or cancel simple cases when their behavior is slowed
 haalanki back trekking karyanvayan sabase kharaab sthiti main ek ghaataanki guarantee dete hai, ve bahut adhik lacheelaapan or suchak shakti pradaan karte hai
 For example, any implementation that allows the use of backreferences or implements the various extensions implemented by Perl must use a back tracking implementation
 kuch karyanvayan sabase pehle tej DFA ko chalaakar do sabase acchhee kalan vidhiyaan uplabdh karaate hai, yah jaanane ke liye ki regular oxpraishan string ke saath thoda bhi mail khate hai yaa nahin or keval isi sthiti main sambhawatah mand back trekking milan hota he
 Regular expression was used with the letters ASCII
 kai regular oxpraishan ingine ab sampurna unicode ke saath bhi kaam kar sakate hai
 In most cases there is no difference in what the set of characters is, but in some cases there is a difference when regular expressions have to work on Unicode

 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition

 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war

 Men and women love to die easily instead of surrendering to the will of the attacker on the endless paths of this unexpected performance and finally : He and his military bravery must melt before the xxrep 4 ; aise kisi desh athwa samooh jisane anhinsa ko apni antim niti bana liya he use parmaanu bam bhi apana das nahin bana saktaa he
 In that country, the level of non-violence passes happily, then it naturally increases so much that it has universal respect milane lagata he
 In line with these ideas, in 1940, when the attacks on the British islands by Nazi Germany appeared imminent, Gandhiji asked the British to follow the following policy of non-violence in peace and war
 main aapse hathiyaar rakhane ke liye kahana pasand karuunga kyonki ye aapako athwa maanavtaa ko bachaane main bekaar hai
 You have to invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini that whatever they want from countries you call them your right
 yadi in sajjanon ko apane ghar par rahane kaa chayan karnaa he tab aapako unhen khaali karnaa hoga

 The Jews should have given themselves to the butcher's knife
 unhen apane aap ko samudri chattaanon se samudr ke andar phank dena chahie tha
 Yet Gandhiji knew that such a level of non-violence would require unwavering faith and courage and for this he realized that it is not held by everyone
 isliye unhone prayek vyakti ko paraamarsh diya ki unhen ahimsa ko apane paas rakhane kii jarurat nahin he khaas taur par us samay jab ise kaayarta ke sangrakshan ke liye upyog main kiya gaya ho
 In his Satyagraha movement Gandhiji kept away people who were afraid to take up arms or felt their own inability to resist
 unhone likhaa ki main maanata hum ki jahaan darpok or hinsa main se kisi ek ko chunanaa ho to main hinsa ke paksh main apni raay duungaa
 i kept repeating the warning on every assembly till they realized that they had come under the authority of a non-destructive force which they had been in possession of before and they had been used to that experiment and believed He had nothing to do with non-violence and took up arms again

 Henry Stephen Salt | After reading and praising the works of Henry Stephen Salt, young Mohandas Gandhi met and corresponded with the vegetarian preacher
 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Gandhiji used to make fruit from the beginning, but started drinking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor
 He never used to consume milk-products because earlier he believed that milk is not a natural diet of man and he was fed with cow's milk
 Chitkaar Seghrina was, and the most important reason was the oath which he made to his late mother
 jab gandhi ji solah saal ke hue tab unke pitashri kii tabiyat bahut karaab thi unke pita kii beemaari ke dauraan ve hameshaa upasthit rahete the kyonki ve apane mata-pita ke prati atyant samarpit the

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"
 gandhi ji kaa maananaa tha ki agar ek vyakti samaaj seva main karyrat he to use saadhaaran jivan kii or hi badhanaa chahie jise ve brahmacharya ke liye aavashyak maanate the

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil
 jon ruskin kii antu dis last, padhne ke baad unhone apane jivan style main parivartan karne kaa faisla kiya tathaa ek samudaay banaaya jise amarpakshi avasthaapan kaha jaataa tha
 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag
 To reflect their ordinary life he later wore a dhoti for the rest of his life gandhi kaa janm hindu dharm main hua, unke puure jivan main adhiktar siddhanton kii utpati hindutv se hua

 Both of them were famous Indian thinkers of that time

 This crisis of Bihar is only going to destroy the body, but the untouchability-borne crisis is destroying our souls

 Has come as a result of this enormity
 main aapse vinati karata hoon ki aap meri baat par man hi man hans kar aisa na sochen ki main to aapke andhvishwaas kii vritti ko jagaa rahaa hoon
 i am not doing anything like this
 


 main bhale hi andhvishwasi kaha jaaon, lekin jis baat ko main apane hriday kii gaharaai main mahasoos kar rahaa hoon, use aapse kahe bina rah nahin saktaa
 


 If you believe in this thing like me, then you will be quick to take decisions and believe that the practice of untouchability like we practice today is not in the Hindu scriptures
 aap mere is vichaar se sahamat honge ki kisi bhi manushya ko asprishy maananaa ek bhayankar paap he
 Man's ego tells him that he is superior to other people
 gandhi ji ke is vichaar ko andhvishwaas ko badhaava dene main sakasham hone ke kaaran avivekpurna maanate hue rabindranath tagore ne likhaa ki bhautik aapadaaon kaa nishchit or ekmaatr mul kaaran kuch khaas bhautik tathyon ke yoga se hota he
 


 No matter how terrible our sins or errors are, there is not much force in them to destroy the structure of the world

 If i use that faith to condemn my opponents because of my gross ignorance, then surely such belief will become a degenerate superstition
