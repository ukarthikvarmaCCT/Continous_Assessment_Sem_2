 16veen shatabdi tak aise chitron ke liye vishesh rup se rajmahalon main kalavithiyaan banavaane kii pratha chal padi or tabhi se chitrashaala sa ""artgelaree"" kaa rup spasht hone laga
 Sebaschiano Cerlio was the first to emphasize the importance of such special galleries in the 16th century

 After the French State Revolution, the artistic materials of the kingdoms were divided among various people
 tab tak landan main kalatmak vastuon ke sangrah kii pratha joro se chal padi thi

 ise rokane ke liye france sarkaar ne rajkeey sangrahalay tathaa chitrashaala kii yojana banaai taaki desh kii anupam kalakritiyon ko rashtriya nidhi ke rup main surakshit rakhaa ja sake
 With this in view, a commission was set up there under the leadership of Alicjande Lenoa and the first national museum was established called "muje National de Manuments Française"
 tatpashchaat sansar ke anya pragatisheel deshon main bhi rashtriya sangrahalay tathaa chitrashalas sthapit hone lageen

 In the construction of an art museum, it is always noted that the building should be constructed in such a way that the viewer respectively comes out from one side to the other and nothing is left undiscovered
 isiliye shuru main golakaar kalasangrahalay banane kaa bhi prachlan hua
 In Paris, Paul Nelson designed similar museum buildings

 Such famous museums are worth visiting Berlin, Munich, British Museum, National Gallery of London, Dresden Museum, Vienna and Marseille Museum

 Christian Vann Michel, director of artistic materials in Vienna, first decorated the National Museum in this manner and this practice followed
 falat: landan, berlin munich tathaa anya kai nagaron main is prakaar ke rashtriya sangrahalay bane
 The planned museum gradually developed into the 19th century
 england main victoria tathaa albert sangrahalay bade hi suniyojit dhang se har prakaar kii kala ko unke vikascram se sajaayaa taaki unka vaigyanik dhang se adhyayan kiya ja sake
 All the artistic materials from prehistoric times to the east and west were arranged in sequence
 yahan tak ki adivaasiyon kii kala tathaa lokkala ko bhi unke vikascram se pradarshit kiya jane laga
 The museum thus became a science of its own and continued to progress

 Gradually the museum is becoming so big that the viewer's mind is getting bored
 isiliye ab isapar vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa he ki kalasangrahalay kaa vaataavaran adhik adhik ruchikar banaaya jaay
 Different rooms have different textures, they are painted in different colors, have different shapes, they are made attractive by garden gardens, display screens and other interesting materials

 International Standard Name Identifier is a method for uniquely identifying the public identities of contributors to media content such as books, TV programmes, and newspaper articles
 Such an identifier consistgits divided into four blocks
 It was developed under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization as Draft International Standard 27729; the valid standard was published on 15 march 2012
 The ISO technical committee 46, subcommittee 9 is responsible for the development of the standard
 ISNI can be used fo The ISNI allows a single identity to be identified using a unique number
 This unique number can then be linked to any of the numerous other identifiers that are used across the media industries to identify names and other forms of identity
 An example of the use of such a number is the identification of a musical performer who is also a writer both of music and of poems
 Where he or she might currently be identified in many different databases using numerous private and public identification systems, under the ISNI system, he or she would have a single linking ISNI record
 The many different databases could then exchange data about that particular identity without resorting to messy methods such as comparing text strings
 An often quoted example in the English language world is the difficulty faced when identifying 'john Smith' in a database
 While there may be many records for 'john Smith', it is not always clear which record refers to the specific 'john Smith' that is required
 If an author has published under several different names or pseudonyms, each such name will receive its own ISNI
 ISNI can be used by libraries and archives when sharing catalog information; For more precise searching for information online and in databases, and it can aid the management of rights across national borders and in the digital environment
 ORCID identifiers are reserved block of ISNI identifiers, for scholarly researchers
 administered by a separate organisation
 Individual researchers can create and claim their own ORCID identifier
 The two organisations coordinate their efforts
 ISNI is governed by an 'international Agency', commonly known as the ISNI-IA
 This UK registered, not-for-profit company has been founded by a consortium of organizations consisting of the Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d ́auteurs et Compositeurs, the Conference of European National Librarians, the International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations, the International Performers Database Association, the Online Computer Library Center and proquest
 It is managed by directors nominated from these organizations and, in the case of CENL, by representatives of the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the British Library
 ISNI-IA uses an assignment system comprising a user interface, data-schema, disambiguation algorithms, and database that meets the requirements of the ISO standard, while also using existing technology where possible
 The system is based primarily on the Virtual International Authority File service, which has been developed by OCLC for use in the aggregation of library catalogues
 Access to the assignment system and database, and to the numbers that are generated as the output of the process, are controlled by independent bodies known as 'registration agencies'
 These registration agencies deal directly with customers, ensuring that data is provided in appropriate formats and recompensing the ISNI-IA for the cost of carrying the assignment system
 Registration agencies are appointed by ISNI-IA but will be managed and funded independently

 There is huge literature related to it in Sanskrit language
 kaamshaastra kaa adharapeeth he - maharishi vatsyayanrachit kamasutra
 Framed in the sutra style, Vatsyayana's most important book does not hold its own in the subject's comprehensiveness and style
 maharishi vatsyayan is shaastra main pratishthata hi maane ja sakate hai, udbhaavak nahin, kyonki unase bahut pehle is shaastra kaa udbhav ho chukaa tha
 We can divide the history of Kamasastra into three periods - pre-vatsyayan period, Vatsyana period and post-post-vatsyayana period
 kaha jaataa he, prajapati ne ek lakh adhyyon main ek vishaal granth kaa pranayan kar kaamshaastra kaa anrabh kiya, parantu kalantar main maanvon ke kalyaan ke liye iske sankshep prastut kiye gaye
 According to the mythological tradition, by the will of Mahadev, "nandi" composed a summary of it in one thousand chapters, to make it even more useful, Uddalak Muni's son Shvetketu shortened it in five hundred chapters
 iske anantar paanchal babhavy ne tritiyansh main isaki or bhi sankshipt kiya—dedh sau adhyyon tathaa saat adhikranon main, kalantar main saat mahneey aacharyon ne prayek adhikaran ke upar saat swatantra granthon kaa nirmaan kiya— The fruit of this separate work proved harmful for the propagation of the scripture and gradually it started to get rid of
 falat: vatsyayan ne in saaton adhikaran grarthon kaa saransh ekatra prastut kiya or is vishisht prayaas kaa parinat fal vatsyayan kamasutra hua
 Thus the emancipation of the literary centuries of the centuries of the present Kamasutra must be understood, although it is difficult to accept the expansion of this infinite practice of tradition-declared Kamasutra texts
