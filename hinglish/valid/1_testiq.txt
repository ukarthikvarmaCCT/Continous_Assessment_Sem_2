 Bhuvan, a resident of Champaner village, is an enthusiastic and idealistic youngster
 madhya pranto kii angrez chhavnee ke senapati, captain rassal ke saath uski nahi banati thi
 When the British ordered to collect the year's revenue, then the villagers went to the British camp with Bhuvan to beg Raja Puran Singh to forgive the rent
 vahaan raja, british afasaron kaa cricket kaa khel dekh rahe the
 When an officer abused a villager, Bhuvan quarreled with the officers and equaled the game of cricket with gilli-danda
 raja ke samaksh bhuvan ne kathor lagaan ke kilaaf apana virodh darj kiya
 Captain Russell did not like this and challenged Bhuvan to play cricket
 jite to salbhar kaa lagaan maaf, haare to lagaan tiguna!!! gaanvvaale to is chunauti mukarana chaahate the, magar captain rassal ne ye faisalaa sirf bhuvan ke haathon main saunpa
 To increase the challenge further, he also gave the greed to forgive the three-year rent
 bhuvan ne maidan par dwandv kaa nyotaa sweekaar kar liya
 Now as if Champaner wanted to crucify Bhuvan
 sabaki zindagi to ab tabah hone ja rahi thi
 But for Bhuvan, so long as i breath
 kai saalon se sookhaa chal rahaa tha
 After all, where would you have paid even a year's rent? And then even Captain Russell was not going to be challenged
 agavaani karte huye bhuvan ne lakdi kaa balla or gend banaae
 Except for a group of few people, the whole village was laughing at the game of Bhuvan
 cricket seekhney yah dal chori chupe chhavnee par jane laga
 There, Captain Rasel's sister Elizabeth saw him hiding in the bushes
 use apane bhai kaa gaanvvasiyon se vyavhaar pasand nahin aayaa
 She started teaching crickets to the village players on the field near the village
 hindi bhashaantar ke liye ek naukar bhi chhavnee se apane saath le aati
 Gradually, spontaneously, this team of Bhuvan started learning the game of cricket in its own unique way
 haath majboot karne ve lakdi katate
 The field learners followed the hens and caught them
 goli apane haath pawan chakki kii tarah ghuma gendbaazi karne laga
 Now the people of the village also started showing enthusiasm and Akhir became ten players

 Garbage was the untouchable cleaning servant of the village
 lautaate vakt usne gend is tarah ghumaakar phanki kii bhuvan dang rah gaya
 The village team got the eleventh selection
 magar gaanv vaale ek achhut ko kis tarah apanaate? ve to use choote tak nahin
 Bhuvan criticized the village and this tradition, which lasted for centuries
 bhuvan ke bhav bhare shabdon se gaanv ke nivasi maan gaye
 Finally the day of combat woke up
 saare praant se log khel dekhne aae
 Captain Rasal's senior officer was also present

 But the British players were also no less

 Suddenly the garbage ball kept rolling
 lakh ne to kai kach bhi gawaae
 At the end of the first day, the white group was dominating
 us raat olizabath ne chhavnee main lakh ko captain rasal se milte dekh liya
 Now it was found that Lakha was cheating from the villagers
 olizabath gaanvvasiyon ko cricket kii talim detii thi yah baat captain rasal ko bataa di
 It was also told that he also lost the catch deliberately
 jab gaanvvasiyon ko pataa chalaa to lakh kii khaal oodhedna chahte the
 Lakha escaped from them and took refuge in the village temple
 lakh ne kubul kiya kii bhuvan se jalan ke kaaran usne yah dhokhebaazi kii
 He also wanted Gauri like Bhuvan but Gauri liked Bhuvan
 ek mauka or lakh ko diya gaya
 The next day Lakha made tremendous catches
 kachra bhi apana jaadu phir chalaane laga
 He took three wickets in three balls simultaneously
 goron kii pari kareeb tinsau ran par samaapt hui
 Bhuvan's team started the batting vigorously
 british sena ke bhootpurv sipaahi deva kamanaseebi se out ho gayi
 Then the British players condemned the village batsmen and threw them out and they soon started getting out
 doosraa din khatm hua or aadhe ran banane abhi baaki the
 Meanwhile, half the team was out
 magar bhuwan abhi khel me jivit tha
 On the third day Baid Ishwar Kaka of the village and Ismail supported Bhuvan
 ismail ko to pichle din chot lagi thi
 Both batted very strongly
 dono ran-out ho gayi
 Now the garbage took the bat
 bhuvan ne bahut koshish kii ki zyaada ballebaazi vahi sanbhale
 The trash required six runs on the last ball
 magar vah ek hi ran le paaya
 Are the villagers losers? The umpire made a no-ball gesture
 ab ek or gend kaa samana bhuvan ne jhela
 Bhuvan hit a six and the village prevailed
 or saath hi barsaat bhi shuru hui
 Captain Russell was sent by his superiors to Central Africa

 In fact, the Church is used in two ways; One is the building of the Lord that is the Church and the other is the organization of Christians
 carch ke atirikt 'kalisia' shabd bhi chalata he
 It is a distorted form of the word 'ecclesia' in the Greek Bible; In the Bible it means - a local or community of Christians around the world
 baad main yah shabd girjaghar ke liye bhi prayukt hone laga
 Here the church will be considered in the sense of institution
 sabhi isai praaia: is baat se sahamat hai ki isa ne keval ek hi carch kii sthapana kii thi, kintu anek kaarnon se isaayiyon kii ekta akshunn nahin rah saki
 As a result, many of their churches or organizations exist today, which are completely independent of each other
 unka vargeekaran is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he : In the early centuries of Christianity, little has been done about the definition and form of the Church
 bible main isa kii jeevani tathaa shiksha kaa jo varnan he usase spasht he ki prarambh hi se isaayiyon kaa vishwaas tha ki is ne samast maanav jati ke liye mukti ke sadhano ko sulabh kar diya or is uddeshy se prithvi par "ishwar kaa rajya" sthapit kiya
 The "kingdom of God" is a community of people who believe in the divinity of Jesus and receive his teachings
 bible main us samudaay ko "ishwar ko praja" kaha gaya he
 For his organization and rule, Jesus selected 12 disciples and gave them special teaching and authority and ordered them to go around the world to preach their teachings and baptize believers into the church
 is prakaar bible main isa ke anuyaayiyon ke samudaay ko carch, "ishwar kaa rajya" tathaa "ishwar kii praja" kaha gaya he
 From these positions it may appear that initially the actual form of the church has been considered limited to external organization, but this is not the case
 isa ne apni shiksha main isapar bal diya he ki unamem tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon main adrishy evam rahasyatmak ekta he
 He said to his disciples- "I take the vine and you are the branches
" " isse spasht ho jaataa he ki carch kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv aadhyatmik hi he
 Saint Paul has laid great emphasis on this spiritual and mystic aspect of the church
 isa tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon kaa aadhyatmik sambandh or isa ke sabhi anuyaayiyon kii rahasyamay ekta ko spasht karne ke liye unhone apane patron main barambar carch ko "isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir" kaha he 
 Hence, from the beginning both the external organization of the church and its spiritual form have been taken care of
 protestant dharm ke kaaran carch main foot padi to dharmacharya carch ke swaroop par adhik chintan karne lage
 Protestant scholars put more emphasis on the invisible form of the church and in response to the Catholic Church's outward organization of the church, its visible membership, etc
 is vivaad main unhone carch ke chaar bahari lakshanon kaa apekshaakrit adhik mahatv diya he
 The true Church of Christ is Catholic; One is, in the bondage of love, all its members believe in the principles of religion
 ek sanskaar, ek si pujanapaddati or ek hi parmadhikari kaa shashan sweekaar karte hai; pavitra he ; apozels he The visible organization of the church may also include some people who are hypocrites who have no spiritual connection with Jesus, who are not part of Jesus' spiritual body
 ishwar hi jaanata he ki koun carch kaa sachcha sadsy he or is kaaran yah mana ja saktaa he ki vaastavik carch adrishy hi he
 Even then, the sacraments are the essential condition of full membership of that invisible real church, so cannot be separated from the invisible church
 aajkal praaia: sabhi protetianst bhi is baat ko maanate hai
 Even though full membership of the Church is required for salvation, it is not compulsory
 ishwar sabhi logon kii mukti chahta he or sab manushyon ke ant:karan main satprerana utpann karata he
 Those who follow the inspiration of God inadvertently become imperfect members of the Church invisibly and can achieve salvation provided by Jesus
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat isai sansar main carch kii ekta ke andolan ko adhik mahatv diya jane laga
 Consequently, in an effort to determine the true form of the church based on the elements existing in the Bible, excluding rebuttal, the emphasis is on the fact that the church is the spiritual body of Jesus
 isa uskaa sheersh he or sachche isai us sharir ke ang hai

 After the death of Jesus, his disciples started preaching Christianity among Jews and non-jews
