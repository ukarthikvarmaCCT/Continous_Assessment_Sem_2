 After some time, the condition of these two cities for the business of East and north-east appeared to be very important and in this view, their progress was great
 samrik drushti se bhi iskaa sthaan adwitiya samajha gaya
 Thus rapid trade advancement necessitated its connection with the progressive northern cities of Germany and eventually it joined the Hanseatic League to serve its objectives
 phir to vibhinn vaataavaran evam paristhitiyon main berlin shanai: shanai: viksit hota rahaa
 In the early 19th century, there were many internal and external disturbances in Berlin which hindered the progress of this city
 aage chalakar phir vah upyukt avasar aayaa jab nagar kii unnati bhalee prakaar hui
 From 1860 to 1920 there was no change in the boundary of Berlin, although in 1912 AD, an institution of the major city and its surrounding areas was formed and the entire areas included in it were called the Great Berlin

 Shortly thereafter it seemed necessary to make some corrections
 san 1920 main berlin main ek nai nagarpalika sthapit kii gai jisamen sabhi padosi kshetron ko prabhavakaari unnati kii drushti se ek prashasan ke antargat rakhaa gaya
 Thus, the development of Berlin at the height of the history of Germany before the Second World War
 san 1945 ke pehle nagar kii avasthaa ko drushtigat karte hue yah dekha gaya ki nagar ke pashchimi bhaag kii ore rahane ke liye makaan basaae gaye the arthath isi bhaag main log based
 Educational, scientific, and military institutions developed in the northwestern part

 The north-eastern part became famous for the manufacture of woolen goods
 purvi tathaa dakshin-purvi bhaag main rangaai, furniture, dhaatu aadi ke udyog panape or dakshini bhaag rail ke udyog ke liye prasiddh hua
 The capital's social office life centered on the Unterden Linden from the Royal Palace to the Bradenburger Tor
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay berlin kii dasha bilkul kharaab ho gai or yah buree tarah tahas nahas ho gaya
 As stated above, it was divided into several parts and various powers gained dominion over it
 vastav main is samay yah nagar raajnneetik khinchaa tani kaa vishay ban gaya tha
 Even after the end of the Second World War, despite being in different blocks, Berlin started progressing again, but it still has not come back to its old position
 berlin main yatayaat tathaa sandeshvaahan ko dekhne se pataa chalata he ki pashchimi berlin main vayuyan dwaara aana janaa bahut adhik hota he
 After the siege, most foreign travelers have come here by airplanes
 yahan ke sthaneey udyog dhandhon kii nirmit vastuen vayuyanon dwaara hi baahar bheji jaati rahi hai
 By the way, traffic is also commonly practiced by rail
 kabhi kabhi soviet sarkaar dwaara kuch baton ko lekar bich bich main vighn baadhaayen utpann ho jaaya karti hai
 Rapid rails from the eastern region are very prevalent in East Germany and other parts of Central Europe under the east, west rail traffic
 jo bhi ho, itnaa avashya he ki vibhinn raajnneetik paristhitiyon ke kaaran berlin main yatayaat bahut badhapurna rahaa he
 In Berlin, traffic service from one part to another is prevalent but trains have to be changed at departmental boundaries
 nity purvi berlin ke log pashchim berlin main dukandaaree aadi kaary karne ke liye jate rahete hai
 In fact, the problem of East and West Germany has reduced the commercial importance of Berlin, especially in terms of water traffic
 san 1945 ke pehle berlin nagar germany kaa prasiddh vyapaarik, beemaa, baking evam dallali kaa centre rahaa
 There were also offices of innumerable huge buildings
 udyog dhandhon ke maamalon main bhi yah nagar bejod rahaa or har prakar ke vaigyanik upkaran, bijli ke saamaan, mashine, motaren, vastra, vayuyan, mashiinon ke aujaar, terbine, tractor, lens aadi banane main europe main iskaa pramukh sthaan rahaa
 From 1945 onwards Berlin tried to regain its economic potential, but the strangely difficult political conditions here crippled West Berlin, causing a problem of unemployment
 yah bhi dekhen: germany kii arthvyavastha Electric furnaces are commonly used to melt metal minerals and metals
 vidyut urja se utpann hui ooshmaa vidyutdhara ke varg ke anupaat main hoti he
 Electric furnaces can produce more heat than coal furnaces and are smaller in size
 ye hanikaarak dhuen athwa gaisen nahin utpann karatin, parantu inkaa mukhya laabh inamen saralata se ooshmaa niyantran karne kaa he
 Heat is controlled very easily by changing the current
 inkaa duurastha niyantran or swat: chaalan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For these reasons, electric furnaces have come into general use
 vidyut bhatthiyon ke bahut se parishkrut rup ab saamaanya ho gaye hai or jyon jyon vidyut shakti sambharan aarthik drushtikon se sasta hota jaataa he, vidyut bhatthiyon kaa prayog nirantar badhata hi jaataa he

 Awadhi is a dialect of Hindi region
 yah uttar pradesh main "avadh kshetra", elahabaad, kaushambi, ambedkar nagar, gonda, baharich, shravasti tathaa fatehpur main bhi boli jaati he
 In addition, one of its branches is known as Bagheli in Baghelkhand
 'avadh' shabd kii vyutpatti "ayodhya" se he
 One of this name was in the reign of the Diocese
 tulsidas ne apane "maanas" main ayodhya ko 'avadhpuri' kaha he
 The old name of this area was also 'kosal', which has been valued since ancient times
 bhashaa shastri dow sar "george abraham grearsan" ke bhashaa surveykshan ke anusaar avadhi bolne waalon kii kul aabaadi 1615458 thi jo san 1971 kii janaganana main 28399552 ho gai
 Currently, researchers estimate that more than 60 million people speak Awadhi
 uttar pradesh ke 19 jilon- sultanpur, amethi, barabanki, pratapgarh, elahabaad, kaushambi, fatehpur, raibareli, unnav, lakhanu, hardoi, sitapur, lakhimpur khiri, baharich, shravasti, balrampur, gonda, faijabad va ambedkar nagar main puri tarah se yah boli jaati he
 While it is used in some areas of 6 districts - Jaunpur, Mirzapur, Kanpur, Shahjahanpur, Basti and Banda
 bihar ke 2 jilon ke saath padosi desh nepal ke 8 jilon main yah prachlit he
 Similarly, in other countries of the world - Mauritius, Trinidad and Tubago, Fiji, Guyana, Suriname, Australia, New Zealand and Holland also have millions of Awadhi speakers
 gathan kii drushti se hindi kshetra kii upbhaashaon ko do virgon-pashchimi or purvi main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 Awadhi is under Eastern
 purvi kii duusari upbhasha chhattisgadhi he
 Awadhi is sometimes called Baiswadi
 parantu baisawadi avadhi kii ek boli maatr he jo unnav, lakhanu, raibareli or fatehpur jile ke kuch bhaagon main boli jaati he
 Many prominent texts including the Ramacharitmanas by Tulsidas and Padmavat by Malik Muhammad Jayasi have been given by this dialect
 iskaa kendra ayodhya he
 Ayodhya is 120 km east of Lucknow
 sooryakanth treepathi 'niraala', pan mahavir prasad dvivedi, acharya ramachandra shukla, raamamanohar lohia, kunwar narayan kii yah janmabhumi he
 This is also the work place of Umrao Jaan, Acharya Narendra Dev and Ram Prakash Dwivedi
 ramai kaaka kii lokwani bhi isi bhashaa main gunjarit hui
 a descendant of Dwijdev, a Hindi-language poet, is the royal family of Ayodhya
 isi parivaar kii ek kanya kaa vivaah dakshin korea ke rajgaraane main arsa pehle hua tha
 Vishwanathha Tripathi, a senior critic of Hindi, has written an important book on Awadhi language and grammar
 phahyan ne bhi apane vivaran main ayodhya kaa zikr kiya he
 Today's Awadhi is coming under the influence of Khadi Boli and English due to migration and culturalization
 avadhi ke pashchim main pashchimi varg kii bundeli or braj kaa, dakshin main chhattisgadhi kaa or purv main bhojpuri boli kaa kshetra he
 To the north of this is the Terai of Nepal, in which there are settlements of tribals with degrees, whose language is completely different from Awadhi
 hindi khadiboli se avadhi kii vibhinnata mukhya rup se vyakarnatmak he
 There is absolutely no lack of the subject "ne" in the subject factor
 anya parasargon ke praaia: do rup milte hai- hrasv or deergh
 
 sangyaaon kii khadiboli kii tarah do vibhaktiyaan hoti hai- vikari or avikari
 In the non-inflected inflection, the noun has its original form and in the vikari the suffix "n" is added to the plural
 karta or karm ke avikari rup main vyanjananth sangyaaon ke ant main kuch boliyon main ek hrasv "u" kii shruti hoti he 
 But of course it is not a complete vowel and linguists find it in the whispering vowel "e" and the eloquent "a"
 sangyaaon ke bahudhaa do rup, hrasv or deergh milte hai
 Apart from these, another form is found in the eastern part of Awadhi region
 avadhi main kahin-kahin khadiboli kaa hrasv rup bilkul lupt ho gaya he; yatha billi, dibbi aadi rup nahin milte belia, dibia aadi hi prachlit hai
 The pronoun has Khadiboli and Braj's "mera Tera" and "mero Tero" forms in Awadhi for "more Tor"
 inke atirikt purvi avadhi main pashchimi avadhi ke "so" "jo" "ko" ke samanaantar "se" "je" "ke" rup praapt hai
 The process of future forms in action is quite different from that of standing
 khadiboli main praaia: pracheen vartmaan ke tadbhav roopon main- ga-gi-ge jodakar rup banaae jate hai
 The future forms in Braj are based on the forms of the ancient future
 
 In Awadhi, often the form of the future is dependent on the ancient forms of poetry
 avadhi kii pashchimi boliyon main keval uttampurush bahuvachan ke rup tavyatant roopon par nirbhar hai
 Like the rest of Braj on the ancient future
 kintu madhyavarti or purvi boliyon main kramash: tavyatant roopon kii prachurtaa badhati gai he
 Khadiboli has the suffix "no" for the noun and "no" in Braj
 parantu avadhi main iske liye "ba" pratyay he 
 In Awadhi, the allegorical singular form ends in "wa"
 bhojpuri main iske sthaan par "l" main ant honevaale rup milte hai 
 One of the main distinguishing features of Awadhi is the past tense form of transitive verb of the other male singular
 ya-"si" main ant honevaale rup avadhi ko chhodkar anyatra nahin milte
 The auxiliary verbs of Awadhi are based on the forms "ha", "ah" and "bata'i"
 upar likhe lakshanon ke anusaar avadhi kii boliyon ke teen varg maane gaye hai : pashchimi, madhyavarti or purvi
 The proximity of the western dialect is due to the influence of Braj and the influence of Bhojpuri on the eastern
 inke atirikt bagheli boli kaa apana alag astitv he
 From the point of view of development, Awadhi is situated between Braj, Kannauji and Bhojpuri
 braj kii vyutpatti nishchay hi shauraseni se tathaa bhojpuri kii magadhi praakrit se hui he
 As Awadhi's position is in between these two, it would be appropriate to assume its exit from the half-century
 khed he ki ardhamagadhi kaa hamen jo pracheenatam rup miltaa he vah paanchavin shatabdi isvi kaa he or usase avadhi ke rup nikaalane main kathinaayee hoti he
 In Pali language, there are often such forms from which the development of Awadhi forms can be proved
 sambhavat: ye rup pracheen ardhamagadhi ke rahe honge
 There are two branches of ancient Awadhi literature: one is Bhaktikavya and the other is Premakhyana poetry
 bhakthikavy main goswami tulsidas kaa "ramcharitamanas" avadhi sahitya kii pramukh kriti he
 Its language is full of Sanskrit vocabulary
 "ramcharitamanas" ke atirikt tulsidas ne anya kai granth avadhi main likhe hai
 Laldas's "awadhbilas" comes under this devotional literature
 isaki rachana sanwat 1700 main hui
 Apart from these, many more devout poets wrote books related to Ramabhakti
 sant kaviyon main baba malukadas bhi avadhi kshetra ke the
 Most of his bani is in Awadhi
 inke shishy baba mathuradas kii bani bhi adhiktar avadhi main he
 Although Baba Dharnidas belonged to Chhapra district, his book was published in Awadhi
 kai anya sant kaviyon ne bhi apane upadesh ke liye avadhi ko apanaaya he
 The most well-known book in Premaakhyan poetry is "padmavat", composed by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, which was composed 34 years before "ramcharitmanas"
 dohe chaupai kaa jo kram "padmavat" main he praaia: vahi "maanas" main miltaa he
 Muslim writers have revealed the secret of Sufism in the Premiakhyan poetry
 is kavy kii parampara kai sau varshon tak chalati rahi
 Manjhan's "madhumalati", Usman's "chitravali", Alam's "madhavanal Kamakandala", Nurmuhammad's "indravati" and Sheikh Nisar's "yusuf Julekha" are compositions of this tradition
 shabdaawalee kii drushti se ye rachanaayen hindu kaviyon ke granthon se is baat main bhinn hai ki isamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii utani prachurtaa nahin he
 Most of the compositions in ancient Awadhi literature are on subjects like patriotism, social reform, and mainly satirical
 kaviyon main pratapanarayan mishra, balbhadra dikshit "padhis", vanshidhar shukla, chandrabhushan dvivedi "ramai kaaka", guru prasad singh "mrigesh" or shardaprasad "bhushundi" vishesh ullekhneey hai
 An important modern text of the manner of "ramcharitmanas" in the tradition of management is the "krishnayana" of Dwarikaprasad Mishra
 isaki bhashaa or style "maanas" ke hi samaan he or granthkaar ne krishnacharit praaia: usee tanmayata or vistaar se likhaa he jis tanmayata or vistaar se tulsidas ne ramcharita ankit kiya he
 Mishra ji has proved through the composition of this book that Awadhi's nature for management is still as attainable as it was in Tulsidas's time
 avadhi lok sahitya kii ek samrudh parampara he
 There have been many researches on Awadhi folk literature
 inamen kuch pramukh hai- avadhi lok sahitya -da sarojini rohtagi a part that is usually presented at the end of a work, which contains the essence of the entire work, its intent and explanation, is called an epilogue
 mulat: iskaa upyog naatakon main hota tha jinamein praaia: naatak ke ant main naatak kaa sutaradhar athwa koi paatr naatak ke bare main shrotaaon kii dharna ko anukool banane ke liee sankshipt vaktavy prastut karata tha
 This type of epilogue occupies an important place in some of Shakespeare's plays
 ben janson ke naatakon main is paddati ke niyamit vyavhaar kaa ek kaaran yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki vah praaia: shrotaaon ke saamne naatak ke dosha ko chhipaane ke liehi inaki yojana karata tha
 By 1660, when the tradition of plays began to decline, they became very important - even the playwrights or theatrical directors started writing this part from famous poets
 is sthiti main kii acchhee samiksha dryden ne apane vikhyath niabandh 'dephence ov alog' main kii he
 Present-day playwrights did not give it much importance
 vartmaan saahatya main isane naatakon kii apeksha vichaaratmak or vivechanaatmak or gaveshnatmak nibandhon main vaigyanikon, darshanikon or anya vichaarkon ne iskaa paryaapt upyog kiya he
 It has become easier to assess the content in additional pages without changing the entire book of new facts in dictionary literature and scientific or enumerated articles
 saamanyat: upsanhaar kaa upyog vivechanaatmak sahitya main adhik hota he or antyalekh athwa pushtalekh kaa upyog kosh athwa anya takneekee sahitya main
 Chakravarti is a Sanskrit word from ancient India used for the conquering kings of the world

 Its importance in surgery is more, because by this the diagnosis is decided and the surgeon gets the path of proper treatment instead of blindly

 This examination is done by cutting the tumor while the tumor is located on the surface

 This is called "needle-tissue-testing"
 utak ke is tarah alag karne ke baad rogavigyaani use him ke samaan jamaakar or uske sookshmatisookshm anuprastha kaat lekar, kuch minuton main hi nidaan kar letaa he

 anya lakshan hai- baatcheet main ekarupata na hona, kisi paristhiti ke anuroop jo vyavhaar hona chahie usase alag vyavhaar
 Apart from this, the problem of sleeplessness, tendency to stay away from society, lack of motivation, difficulty in doing your daily activities, etc
 are other symptoms
 manoveekshipti or paagalpan donon shabd asaadhaaran manodasha ke bodhak he, parantu jahaan paagalpan ek saadhaaran prayog kaa shabd he, jiskaa kanoonee upyog bhi kiya jaataa he, vahaan manoveekshipti chikitsashastra kaa shabd he jiskaa chikitsa main vishesh arth he
 a mad person often does not care about his body and work
 uski hifaazat duusare logon ko kerani padati he
 Therefore, if he commits a crime, he is not considered a victim of punishment
 isse miltaa-julata, parantu isse pruthak, arth manoveekshipti kaa he
 In a demented person, from simple abnormalities to absolutely insanity-like behaviors are seen
 kuch manoveekshipt vyakti thodi hi chikitsa se achche ho jate hai
 They live in the society and do not harm the society
 unamem aparaadh kii pravriti nahin rahati
 Conversely, some demented individuals have a strong tendency to crime
 ve apane bhitari man main badale kii bhaavana rakhte hai, jise veikshipt vyavhaaron main prakat karte hai
 There are some deranged people who lack the ability to understand the difference between good and bad behavior
 ve hanste-hanste kisi vyakti kaa galaa ghot de sakate hai, par unhen aisa nahin jaan padataa ki unhone koi jaghanya aparaadh kaa daalaa he
 In this way, dementia involves insanity, but not all demented people can be called insane
 maansik chikitsakon ne manoveekshipti ke pradhanat: do prakaar maane hai : ek sharirajnya or doosraa manojnya
 These are called bio- and functional maneuvers
 yah veikshipti paitruk parampara se praapt hoti he
 In many families it is seen from generation to generation
 kabhi kabhi pita kii or kabhi mata kii purv pidiyon main ise paaya jaataa he
 Sometimes psychosis is not present in the immediate earlier generation, but it is found in a distant ancestor
 kisi vishesh prakaar ke rog ke kaaran jin kii vishisht prakaar kii kshati ho jaati he or jab yahi jin phir se nae sharir ke nirmaan kaa kaaran hota he, tab uski kshati is nae praani main vyakt hoti he
 Just as tuberculosis and syphilis continue to be inherited, similarly body-borne psychosis continues to run traditionally
 is prakaar ke rog kii chikitsa ke liye anek vaigyanik khonjen ho rahi hai, parantu unamem paryaapt safalataa abhi tak nahin mili he
 The second type of psychosis is psychodynamic
 yah veikshipti prabal maansik sangharsh se utpann hoti he
 Psychosis is not mandatory in the ancestors of this type of patient
 ise ham manouvaigyanik manoveekshipti kah sakate hai
 The reason for psychological psychosis lies in a man's own life
 kuch logon main janm se hi snaayu kii durbalata hoti he
 This infirmity does not come from the ancestral tradition, but after the child is conceived
 phir vyakti ke bachapan ke sanskaar uske vikaas ke anukool nahin hote, use anek prakaar kii apriy bhavatmak anubhutiyaan hoti hai
 The thing that confirms a person's life is childhood love and encouragement
 iske abhaav main vyakti kaa vyaktitv sugathit or drudh nahin ho paata, atev jab praudh jivan main use bhavatmak ghatnaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, tab vah aatmavishvaas kha detaa he
 Sometimes when pampered in childhood, extraordinary behavior arises in humans
 adhik laad pyaar kii avasthaa main manushya aatmaniyantran kii shakti usee prakaar praapt nahin kar paata jis prakaar vah adhik taadna kii sthiti main durbal man kaa bana rahata he
 When such a person encounters a cruel environment, then a state of psychosis arises in him
 manoveekshipti or sanak main bahut kuch samanta he, parantu donon main bhed bhi he
 As far as their cause is concerned, both of them have the same cause, but both have extraordinary and understandable amounts of behavior
 sanakee manushya ke vishesh vyavhaar hi asaadhaaran hote hai
 Almost all behavior of a deranged person is extraordinary
 vah kabhi kabhi hi saamaanya sthiti main aata he, par sanakee manushya samaaj main apana jivan thik se chalaata rahata he
 Others in the society may call him a freak, a freak, but he does his work mostly properly
 sanakee, athwa unmadagrast, vyakti thode samay hi asaadhaaran rahata he, kintu veikshipti sab samay asaadhaaran rahata he
 The crazy man sometimes gets to know about the paranormal
 vah apane aapako isse mukt karne kii cheshtaa bhi karata he or nirantar praytn karne se vah apni asaadhaaranta se mukt bhi ho jaataa he
 a deranged person does not have this ability
 jivan main vah apane aapako sanbhaal bhi nahin saktaa
 Others have to take care of him
 manoveekshipti kaa praathmik vargeekaran shaareerik or manovaigyanik rup main pehle kiya gaya he, parantu inkaa vargeekaran duusare prakaar se bhi kiya jaataa he
 Some psychics consider themselves very big people
 unhen kabhi vichaar aata he ki ve kisi devi devtaa kii krupa se kuch aisi alokik shaktiyaan praapt kar chuke hai, jisase ve jo bhi ichha karen vahi purna ho jaaegi
 Those who become deranged while doing Yog Sadhana fall in this category
 is prakaar ke manoveekshipt ahamkaari veikshipt yaa sanvibhramvat yaa paranaid kahe jate hai
 Their ego keeps on increasing, but it does not become a reason for their happiness but it becomes a cause of sorrow
 uske man main yah vichaar aata he ki samaaj ke duusare log unke viruddh sadaiv shadyantr karte rahete hai
 Because of this, they are unable to achieve the goal of their greatness
 atev ve apane aas paas ke logon ko shatru ke rup main dekhne lagate hai
 Such people think that there are detectives of some enemy around them, who are trying to bring them down
 ve kabhi kabhi duusare logon par ghaatak prahaar bhi kar dete hai
 According to Dadra Freud, these people have a maladjustment since childhood, which arises due to the affectionate environment of the home and the growth of homosexual love and subsequent suppression
 sanvibhramvat rogi main uchit aatmaheenata kii bhaavana rahati he
 Psychosis is different from paranoia and vice versa
 vishadveikshipti kaa rogi apane aapako sadaa dayaneey avasthaa main sochataa he
 He finds an atmosphere of sorrow all around him
 vah apane jivan ko hi vyarth samajhataa he
 He sees the mere pity of human beings in a pathetic life
 1 In his view, the catastrophe of the world is going to happen very quickly and it is only good for the catastrophe
 vah apane sabhi sambandhiyon or pariwaron kaa nikat bhavishya main nishchit vinaash dekhtaa he
 Where the patient of paranoia is talkative and boastful, there is no want to talk to anyone with an apocryphal
 use kisi se milane julne, khelkud main bhaag lene, kisi sudanr drishy ko dekhne kii ichha hi nahin hoti
 He finds the whole world uninteresting
 vah nahaane dhone, tathaa hajaamat banane ko vyarth samajhataa he
 Even without insisting on the other, he does not even eat
 kabhi kabhi vah upwas kaa itnaa aagrah karata he ki uske munh main nalee daalkar jabardastee doodh pilaayaa jaataa he, taaki vah mar na jaay
 The third type of psychosis is euphoria-sadism-psychosis
 ve baari-baari se ullas or vishaad kii manodasha main rahete hai
 In the state of euphoria, he becomes extremely fickle, runs a lot here, talks to many people, puts in various tasks and laughs a lot
 iske pratikul aacharan vishaad kii avasthaa main hota he
 The mood of these deranged is not so extraordinary that they cannot be treated
 maansik rogon main manodashaon kaa badalte rahanaa, chaahe manodasha kitni hi asaadhaaran kyon na ho, rogi ke liye kalyansuchak he
 Unlike the above three types of moods, there is a complex psychosis called psychodynamics
 is manodasha main manushya ko apane vyaktitv kaa kuch gyaan hi nahin rah jaataa
 There is neither a question of gaiety nor gloom in his life
 atev is manodasha ko doosraa bachapan kaha ja saktaa he
 On coming in this mood, the patient has no power to handle himself
 vah malmutra ke nity kaary bhi nahin kar paata
 He makes excrement on the bed itself
 uske hansane or rone main koi vichaar hi nahin rahata
 No estimate can be made about what time he will do it
 do chaar minute tarkyukt baaten karte hue vah koi aisi baat kah saktaa he jo bilkul anargal ho
 He can strangle the child standing in front of him while laughing
 manoveekshipti ashaant maansik rogon main gini gai he
 Therefore, when someone suffers from any of the above types of psychosis, then it is necessary to keep it in mental hospitals
 chikitsaalay se baahar rahane par manoveekshipti dusron ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to keep them separate from the general public
 chikitsaalayon main inkaa upachaar praaia: neend laanevaali dawaaiyon, athwa behoshee laanevaale injectionon, ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Here, they are being treated by electric shaking for 30-40 years
 in sabhi prakaar ke upachaaron se kuch veikshiptiyon ko laabh hota he, parantu abhi tak manoveekshipti kii koi achook upachaarvidhi khoji nahin ja saki he
 Psychological treatment of psychosis is not possible according to Dr
 Freud's statement
 duusare manovaigyanikon ke anusaar sabhi prakaar kii duusari maansik chikitsaayen safal hone par bhi, bina manovaigyanik upachaar hue rogi ko sthaayee laabh nahin hota
 Therefore, sleep producing and unconsciousness drugs and electric shocks do not provide permanent benefit in psychosis
 inke hone par bhi manovaigyanik upachaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Psychological treatment aims at catharsis of proper ill effects and establishment of mental integration

 Big Ben is the nickname for the large bell on the north end of London's Westminster Palace, and is often expanded to refer to a clock or clock tower
 yah duniya kii sabase badi chaar mukhmandal vaali ghantanad ghadi or teesri sabase badi swatantra rup se sthit clock tower he
 In May 2009, the 150th anniversary of this watch was celebrated in which many celebrations were held
 westminster main clock tower ralf hengham, raja kii nyaaypith ke mukhya nyaayadhish, ralf henghm ke pavitra dhan se 1288 main banaaya gaya tha
 The current tower for a new palace was raised as part of a design by Charles Barry after the old Westminster Palace was destroyed by fire on the night of 16 October 1834
 nai sansad ko ek nav gothic style main banaaya gaya tha
 Although Barry Palace was the chief architect, he chose Augustus Pugin for the design of the Clock Tower, including the Skarisbrick Hall that resembled the old Pugin design
 clock tower ke liye banaaya gaya dizin pugin kaa apane paagalpan or mrityu se pehle aakhri dizin tha or khud pugin ne bairi dwaara chitra ikattha karne vaali antim yatra ke samay ke bare main likhaa he: "maine shri bairi ke liye apane jivan main kabhi itani mehnat se kaam nahin kiya, kal main sabhi dizin use saunpane vaala hum jisase vah clock tower ke nirmaan ko khatm kar sake or ye sundar he
 "the tower is built in Pugin's famous Gothic revival style and is 96
3 meters high
 clock tower sanrachana ke nichle bhaag 61 meter main enstan chuunaa aavaran se rangi ret ke saath eent-chinai ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The remaining height of the tower is made of curved streak of cast iron
 tower ko 15-meter varg bedaa par banaaya gaya he, yah jameen str ke neeche 4 meter gaharaai par 3-meter moti kancreet se bani he
 The four faces of the clock are 55 meters above the ground
 tower kaa interior aaytan 4,650 cubic meter he
 Despite being one of the world's most famous attractions for tourism, the interior of the tower is not open to foreign visitors, although residents of the United Kingdom are able to arrange visits through members of parliament
 haalanki, tower main koi elieater nahin he, to jin vyaktiyon ko upar janaa he unhen 334 pathar kii seedhia chadhani padati he
 Due to changes in land conditions since construction, the tower has slightly bent to the northwest by about 220 millimeters, giving the clock a tilt of about 1 / 250
 thermal prabhaavon ke kaaran yah prativarsh kuch millimetre purab or pashchim kii ore aage-peeche hota rahata he
 The clock face is so large that the Clock Tower was once the world's largest four-faced watch
 ghadi or dial ougustus pugin dwaara dizine kiye gaye the
 The Clock's facades are set on an iron frame with a diameter of 7 meters, which supports 312 pieces of opal glass in place of a window with a stained glass
 kaanch ke kuch tukdon ko haathon ke nirikshan ke liye hataaya ja saktaa he
 There is gilding around the dial
 ghadi ke har mukhmandal ke aadhaar par gilt aksharon main latin shilaalekh he: Which means, Lord, keep our Queen Victoria the First safe
 ghadi apni vishwasaneeyata ke liye prasiddh he
 Its designer was the lawyer and amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Dennison and George Airey, astronomer Royal
 nirmaan kaa kaary clockmekar edward jon dent ko saunpa gaya tha; 1853 main unki mrityu ke baad unke sautele bete fredrick ne 1854 main yah kaam puraa kiya
 Since the tower was not completed until 1859, Dennison had time to experiment: Instead of using deadbeat escapment and remontire according to the original design, Dennison invented the double three-legged gravity escape
 yah escapment tantra pendulum or ghadi ke bich sabase acha algaav pradaan karata he
 The pendulum is installed inside an enclosed windproof box under the cloakroom
 yah 3
9 meter lanbaa he jo 300 kilo vajan kaa he or har 2 second par dhadkta he
 The clockwork system in a room weighs less than 5 tons
 pendulum ke sheersh par puraane sikkon kaa ek chota sa dhuanra he, ye ghadi ke samay ko samyojit karne ke liye he
 Adding the coin elevates the center position of the pendulum slightly, causing the rod's pendulum to shorten and therefore increase the rate at which the pendulum moves
 sikaa jodne yaa hataane ke kaaran ghadi kii gati prati second 0
4 se badal jaaegi
 On 10 May 1941, a German bombardment damaged two clock halls and the roof sections of the tower and destroyed the House of Commons chamber 
 The architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott built a new five-story block
 The two floors are occupied by the existing chamber which was first used on 26 October 1950
 baari bambaari ke baavjood ghadi sahi tareeke se kaary kar rahi he or blitz ke dauraan bajati bhi he
 The main bell, officially known as the Great Bell, is the largest bell in the tower and part of the Great Clock of Westminster
 ghanti ko big ben upnaam se behatar janaa jaataa he
 The original bell was a 16
3-ton clock bell, cast at stockton-on-tees by John Warner & Sons on 6 August 1856
 ghanti ko sar benjamin haul ke sammaan main namit kiya gaya tha or uskaa naam us par ankit kiya hua he
 However, another theory for the origin of the name is that the bell is named after the contemporary heavyweight boxer Benjamin Count
 yah kaha jaataa he ki multah ghanti ko rani victoria ke sammaan main victoria yaa royal victoria kaha janaa tha, lekin ek saansad ne ek sansadeey bahes ke dauraan upnaam kaa suzav diya; tippanee hencerd main darj nahin he
 Since the tower was not yet finished, the bell was mounted in the new Palace Yard
 1856 main cast, pehali ghanti ko ek solah ghodon dwaara taiyaar kii trollies par isaki pragati ke liye bheed dwaara kii ja rahi jayakaar ke saath tower tak pahunchaaya gaya tha
 Unfortunately, it broke at the time of testing in such a way that it could not be repaired and needed replacement
 ghanti ko dobaaraa whitepel bel foundry par 13
76 ton bel kii tarah cast kiya gaya
 It was pulled 200 feet to the clock tower of the clock tower
 It took 18 hours to a foot
 yah 2
2 meter lambaa or 2
9 meter chaudaa he
 This new bell rang for the first time in July 1859
 sitambar main yah bhi hathaudaa ke tahat tut gaya, maatr do maheene ke baad ise aadhikarik taur par marammat hetu bheja gaya
 According to the foundry manager George Meyers, Dennison used the hammer twice the maximum specified load
 teen saal ke liye big ben ko kamishan se baahar le jaaya gaya tha or dobaaraa sthapana hone se pehle tak ghante timahi ghanti ke nimnatam bhaag par prahaar karte the
 To make the repair, a square piece of metal was cut from the rim surrounding the crack and the bell was given a 1 / 8 tarn so that the new hammer would hit a different location
 Big Ben has been ringing with old strums ever since and is still in use today, complete with a crack
 isaki casting ke samay main, big ben "great paul" ke samay tak mahaan british dwipon main sabase badi ghanti thi, ek 17 ton ghanti jo vartmaan main saint paul cathedral main lataki hui he,1881 main cast kii gai thi
 Along with the Great Bell, the clock tower has four quarter hours that play Westminster quarters on quarter hours
 chaar timahi ghantia gsazca:music,fsazca:music,e or b he
 It was cast by John Warner and Sons at their Crescent Foundry in 1857 and 1858
 foundry jevin crescent main thi, jise ab barbicon, di city of landan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Quarter bells play a 20-chime sequence, 1–4 at quarter past, 5–12 at half-past, 13–20 and 1–4 at quarter and 5–20 hours
 Since the following bell is hit twice as quickly, there is not enough time to pull the hammer back and it is supplied with two wrench hammers on the opposite side of the bell
 yah dhun cambridge jhankaar kii he jo pehali baar mahaan saint mairi carch, cambridge kii jhankaar ke liye upyog hui thi or anumaanit rup se iskaa ek sanskaran handal ke maseehaa se liye gaye ek vaakyansh main wiliam kroach ko samarpit he
 The words of the chimes are derived once again from the Great Saint Mary, and instead the allusion to Psalm 37: 23-24 is as follows: "during this hour / God be my guide / And your power / Any Legs not slipping "
 This clock is written on a plaque on the wall of the room
 upnaam big ben kuch bahes kaa vishay he
 The surname was first applied to the Great Bell, it may have been named after Sir Benjamin Hall who oversaw the founding of the Great Bell, or the English heavyweight champion of boxing, Benjamin Count
 Now Big Ben is collectively used to refer to the clock, tower, and bell, although the surname is not universally accepted to refer to the clock and the tower
 tower ke bare main kaam karne vaale kuch lekhakon ne big ben shabdon kaa prayog pehle sheershak kii tarah karke or phir yah spasht karke ki pustak ke vishay ghadi or tower ke saath-saath ghanti bhi he is samasya se bachaav kiya he
 The watch has become a symbol of the United Kingdom and London, especially in the visual media
 jab ek tivi yaa film nirmaataa britain ke ek saamaanya sthaan ko ingit karnaa chahta he to aisa karne ke liye ek lokapriy tarika aksar agrabhumi main ek laal dabl dekar bas yaa kaali taxi ke saath clock tower kii chhavi dikhaanaa he
 In this way the sound of the clock bell has also been used in audio media, but as the Westminster quarters are being heard from other clocks and devices, the unique nature of this sound has been greatly diluted
 clock tower united kingdom main navvarsh samaaroh kaa focus he, radio or tivi stesan navvarsh kaa swaagat karne ke liye isaki jhankaar ke saath tuning karte he
 Similarly, on the occasion of Remembrance Day, Big Ben's chimes are broadcast to mark the 11-hour hour of the 11-month month and to initiate a two-minute silence
 ITN kii news at ten main big ben kii jhankaar ke saath clock tower kii chhavi ko dikhaaya jaataa he or isamen khabar surkhiyon kii ghoshnaa kaa uccharan kiya jaataa he yah aisa pichley 41 varshon se kar rahaa he
 Big Ben's chimes continue throughout the headlines and all ITV news bulletins use a graphic based on the Westminster clock face
 big ben ko BBC radio 4 or BBC world sarvice par kuch samachar buletinon se pehle ghante par suna ja saktaa he, yah abhyaas 31 disambar 1923 se shuru kiya gaya he
 The sound of the chime is sent in real time by a permanently installed microphone tower and is connected by a line to the broadcast house
 landan nivasee jo clock tower or big ben se ek uchit duuri par rahete hai, jhankaar or radio yaa tivi donon ke madhyam se nae saal kii purv sandhya par teraa baar ghanti kii aawaaj sun sakate hai
 This is possible because of the offset between live and electronically transmitted chimes because the speed of radio waves is much slower than the speed of sound
 jaise hi radio dhire dhire down ho jaataa he mehmaanon ko jor se jhankaar kii ginati karne ke liye aamantrit kiya jaataa he
 The Clock Tower has been featured in several films, most notably in the 1978 version of The thirty-nine Steps, in which the protagonist Richard Hane attempts to stop the clock's progress by hanging on the minute hand of the clock's western face
 james bond kii chauthi film "thanderbal" main big ben dwaara ghante par galati se kiye gaye atirikt prahaar ko apradhi sanghathan chaaya dwaara namit kiya gaya he jo is baat kaa sanket he ki british sarkaar ne isaki parmaanu vasuuli ki jabaran maang ko sweekaar kar liya he
 It was also used in the Shanghai Knights film starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, and is shown partially destroyed in the Doctor Who episode "alien of London"

 It was headed by an organization called the "religious Samasvara Sangha", also known as the "union of Religious and Homogeneous Fellows"
 muqqebaaz ko angrezi main "boxr" kehete hai isliye vidrohiyon ko yahi bulaayaa jane laga
 Prior to this rebellion, the countries of Europe had divided China into their spheres of influence where they used to bully themselves
 bahari prachaarkon ne kuch chiniyon ko isaai bhi bana liya tha or samaaj main yah ilzaam uth rahe the ke china kii apni samskruti bhrasht karne ke saath-saath kisaanon se unki sampati chhinane main bhi isaai giraje agrasar hai
 In trade with China there were many things for Europe to buy from China but China wanted very little from Europe
 keval china kii taraf hi paisa jane se rokane ke liye europea taaqaton ne chiniyon ko afim bechnaa shuru kar diya or china kii sarkaar par is afim ke vyaper ko rokane ke liye koi bhi qadam uthaane par pabandi laga di
 The Boxer rebels were also angry with this
 san 1900 ke june ke maheene main vidrohiyon ne saare videshiyon ko khadedakar beijing ke duutavasi mohalle main band kar diya tha
 At first the imperial government of China remained segregated, but at the instigation of some courtiers, they took the side of the rebellion and declared war on foreign powers
 55 din tak videshi duutavasi mohalle main band rahe
 The Chinese government would sometimes say that it would kill all foreigners and sometimes it wanted to restore peace with foreigners
 videshi taaqaton ne is vidroh ko kuchalane ke liye ek aath-rashtriya gut banaaya jisamen austria-hungary, frans, germany, italy, japan, rus, britain or sanyukt rajya america shaamil the
 The group brought an army of 20,000 soldiers from outside and defeated the Chinese government and seized Beijing

 In fact, no debt is truly "risk-free", but defaulters in "risk-free" rate of return are much less likely to default

 Loans allow individuals and organizations to do whatever they are otherwise unable to do or are not allowed
 Generally, in industrialized nations, people use it to buy houses, cars and many other things which due to being very expensive, they are not able to buy with the available cash money
 Companies also use debt in many ways to effect investment in their assets so that their return of equity is effective
 This effect, the ratio of debt to equity, is considered important in determining the risk of investment; The more debt on each equity, the more risky it will be
 This increased risk for both companies and individuals can lead to weak results, as the cost of debt care may exceed the ability to pay due to external events or internal difficulties

 Lack of demand reduced business activity and created more unemployment
 In a more direct sense, both inflation has also led to greater bankruptcy due to increased debt costs and reduced demand

 deazal eenjan ek antardahan ingine he jo band sthaan main vaayu ko sampidit karne se utpann ooshmaa kaa upyog karke eendhan main jvalan utpann karata he
 Thus, it is different from spark-ignition engines because they use spark-plugs to ignite a mixture of air and fuel
 ise sampeden-jvalan ingine bhi kehete hai
 The mechanical energy derived from it is used in vehicles, generators and many other works
 isaki khoj 1892 main paris main janme german mul ke abhiyantaa rudolf deazal ne kii thi
 Among other chemicals, it emits nitrogen and soot particles as a byproduct of combustion, which pose a risk of pollution
 is ingine main vaayu ko prathamatya dabaaya jaataa he jisaki vajah se iskaa taapmaana badhata he
 After this, as soon as diesel is poured into it, it starts burning due to the heat, which produces more heat and it pushes the piston above it
 is kaaran se gati praapt hoti he jisko kai giyaron tathaa relon ke sahare icchit kaam karne main lagaaya jaataa he
 Till diesel was not used in trucks, buses and rail locomotives, it was unknown for the purpose of delivery
 iske anya upyog bhi itane hi mahatvapurn the, par aise jaan nahin padate the
 Today, diesel engines are used in ships, generators, pumps, compressors, mills, rock pullers, soil removal machines, tractors, etc
 bhinn bhinn kaaryon ke liye deazal ingine kaa akar tathaa akruti bhitr hoti he
 When comparing diesel engines to mass engines, such as steam turbines, gas turbines or steam engines, the excellence of diesel engines is known
 sampeedan prajvalan hone ke kaaran ingine kii banaavat main saralata hoti he
 There is no hassle of adding separate equipment to the engine to burn fuel
 isse aise injanon kii ushma dakshata 36 pratishat rahati he, jabaki gasolin ingine kii ushma dakshata keval 25 pratishat, gas tarabine kii keval 20 pratishat tathaa pashchaagr bhaap ingine kii keval 12 pratishat hoti he
 These figures are the average values of the latency of the entire load
 jab boj kam hota he to uparyukt injanon main kisi ingine kii ushma dakshata bad jaati he or kisi kii kam ho jaati he
 Rudolf Diesel patented the internal combustion engine in 1892 and it was named diesel engine after him, although the first real engine was built in 1895 AD
 is ingine kaa swatantra pareekshan shozotor ne 1897 i0 main aughavarg main kiya or deazal injanon kaa aam pradarshan munikh pradarshnee main 1898 i0 main hua
 In 1900, Diesel announced to the Paris Congress that after much experimentation, the final form of the operational cycle he had assumed was suction, pressure, expansion and development from a single stroke sequence of four-stroke variety
 pehle ke deazal ingine vaayu-ant:kshep ingine the or ingine ke silinder main eendhan dene ke liye bahut hi unchaa dabaav prayog main laayaa jaataa tha
 In 1910, James mckechnik developed a solid injection system, in which simple, high-pressure fuel-oil pumps were used for injection
 sphuling-prajvalan-gasolin or sampeden-prajvalan-tel injanon main antar eendhan kii prakruti main he
 Gasoline and air are mixed exactly in the carburettor of the blasting ignition engine and in the engine cylinder, this homogeneous mixture, whatever the load, is transported at a given ratio
 hawa kaa eendhan se anupaat, jo vaayu-eendhan-anupaat kehalaata he, gasolin ingine main 14
5 : 1 sthir rahata he
 Since there is no additional room for mixing air and fuel oil in diesel, the mixing work has to be completed in the cylinder itself
 deazal sadaiv hawa kii nishchit maatra ko hi sampeedit karata he, par boj ke anusaar ant:kshipt eendhan kii maatra main antar rah saktaa he
 If the burden is full, then the air-to-air ratio is 22: 1
 yadi ingine koi kaam nahin karata to anupaat 85 : 1 rahata he
 Diesel engines require a greater amount of air than gasoline engines
 vaayu-eendhan-anupaat ke tathaa sampeedan ke unchaa rahane se deazal ingine main kam eendhan kharch hota he
 Diesel motor car will work twice as much fuel as the gasoline motor car works
 deazal ingine main ek anya laabh yah he ki isamen sasta eendhan jal saktaa he or eendhan main aag lagane kii sambhaavna kam rahati he
 The design and size of diesel engines were standardized neither in Europe nor in the United States, until the mid-20th century
 deazal nirmaataaon ne apni-apni ruchi or vichaaron ke anusaar bhinn bhinn prakaar ke deazal ingine taiyaar kiye
 In this way engines of many shapes, shapes and many tricks have been made
 silinder kii vyavastha panktiyon main areey akruti arthath v kii akruti kii, pratidwandvi pistanon vaali, yaa saamaanya ek kriya vaali, yaa do kriyavaali hoti he
 In two or four round engines, the cylinders and columns remain separate, or in the same section
 eendhan dwaar or valvevyavastha ke kaaran vaayu ke bahaav main antar rahata he
 The piston of a diesel may be overloaded and inter-cooled, or devoid of trunk or cross head type
 eendhan ke rup main vibhinn gaisen, jaise prakritik gas, pradeepan gas, utpaadak gas, dhaman bhatti gas, yaa mel naalee gas, vibhinn prakaar ke eendhan tel, bhari kachche tel, halke kachche tel, halke asut tel, yaa gas or tel donon prayukt ho sakate hai
 Different locomotives have illuminated or preheated, air or energy cells, or are of the open chamber type
 madhya maarg ke rup main hi vibhinn akritiyon kaa vikaas hua or prayek nirmaankarta ne vistrut kshetra main upyog ke drushtikon se deazal kaa nirmaan kiya
 Classification of diesel engines has come in many ways, but the general classification is based on their speed
 jo ingine prati minute 1,200 yaa isse adhik parikraman karata he use ucch chaal ingine, jo prati minute 500 yaa isse kam parikraman karata he use nimna chaal ingine or in donon ke bich kii chaal vaale ingine ko madhya chaal ingine kehete hai
 High speed engines are made of small sacks, ie measuring 6 inches or less, so that they can compete with gasoline engines in size and power output
 silinder kii vyavastha saamanyat: paktiyon main yaa v akruti kii rahati he
 Its auxiliary parts are electric starter, oil pump, water pump and cooling system, which are integral parts of the engine
 ingine main shaayad hi pratyaksh patiwarti ekak hota ho
 If reversal is required, the reversible gear is added separately
 dahan kii suvidha ke liye ucch chalwale ingine main bahudhaa kshobhanakaksh vaayu yaa urja cell rahete hai
 There is hardly any arrangement for the auxiliary part of the piston to cool
 is prakaar ke ingine main prati silinder adhik se adhik lagbhag 30 ashwashakti viksit hoti he or isamen eendhan ke rup main halake varg kaa deazal tel prayukt hota he
 Diesel engines operate on four-stroke, or two-stroke cycles
 iskaa aashay yah he ki chaar stroke chakra ingine main piston ke puure chaar stroke, yaa crank shaft ke do parikraman, kii aavashyaktaa padati he, jabaki do stroke chakra ingine main keval do strokka, yaa crank shaft ke keval ek parikraman, kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 The four stroke cycle engine has the following functions: antargrahan - pravesh vaala valve khulata he or avarohi piston silinder main nai hawa khinchataa he
 Compression - The inlet valve closes and pressurizes air at a pressure of 500 pounds per square inch in the ascending piston cylinder itself
 shakti - sampeedan ke aghat ke ant main idhan kaa ant:kshep hota he
 It immediately ignites automatically and then spreads
 failane se shakti utpann hokar piston ko phank detii he
 Exhaust - Now the exhaust valve opens and the ascending piston expels the burnt gases outside the cylinder
 yah chakra baar baar chalata he
 The operation of the two-wheeled mono-scavenging engine also has ingestion, compression, power and exhaust functions
 avarohi piston praveshdwar or nikaasmookaaon ko kholta he
 This causes the detergent air to enter the cylinder from the entrance mouth and the exhaust cylinder is bleached and discharged
 arohi piston pravesh or nikaasmookaaon ko aachhadit kar detaa he, tathaa silinder main vaayu ko sampeedan kar, dabaav badhaakar, lagbhag 500 pound prati varg inch kar detaa he
 Fuel is now injected into the superfluous air
 idhan swat: jal uthta or prasaarit hota he, jisase piston par aghat padataa he or vah balpurvak neeche aa jaataa he
 The descending piston now opens the entry and exit doors, allowing the scavenger to enter compressed air from the entrance and remove the burnt gases from the cylinder through the exhaust gate
 is prakaar chakra puraa ho jaataa he
 If a two cycle engine is ideal, then a four cycle engine of the same expansion and speed will get twice as much power, but in reality such an ideal engine would not be achieved
 silinder main hi dwaara hone ke kaaran do chakra ikin ke aghat vastut: kam prabhaavshaalee hote hai chaar chakra ingine kii tulana main do chakra ingine se laabh yah he ki ek hi shakti utpaadan ke liye do chakra ingine halkaa hota he, isamen purje kam hote he or banaavat adhik saral hoti he
 As a result, larger engines are usually made of two-cycle and smaller smaller engines are four-cycle
 par is niyam kaa paalan sadaa nahin hota
 Both types of high quality engines are made for convenience
 tashkurgaan madhya asia main china dwaara niyantrit shinjiyang praant ke tashkurgaan tajik swashasit zile kii rajdhani he
 This is the first significant Chinese stop on the Karakoram highway coming from Pakistan to gilgit-baltistan region of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 is rajmarg par sarhad par sthit khunjaraab darre kii chini taraf tashkurgaan he or pakistani taraf sost he

 These routes traveled through Kashgar in the north, Qargilik in the east, Badakhshan and Wakhan in the west and Chitral and Hunza area of gilgit-baltistan in the southeast towards the mainland of India
 is kshetra kaa madhya asia ke sughda ilaake se or bharat se gaharaa saanskrithik va vyapaarik sambandh tha or shilalekhon main yahan hind arya logon ke aane-jane ke chihn mili hai
