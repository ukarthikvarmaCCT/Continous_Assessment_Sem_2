 shantipurna sashastitv ke paanch siddhant yani panchasheel china, bharat va myenmar dwaara varsh 1954 ke june maah main pravartit kiye gayi
 Panchsheel is an important contribution made by China and India to the peace and security of the world, and till date is on the tongue of the people of both countries
 deshon ke sambandhon ko lekar sthapit in siddhanton kii mukhya vishaywastu he- ek-duusare kii prabhusatta va pradeshik akhandta kaa sammaan kiya jaye, ek- duusare par akraman na kiya jaye, ek-duusare ke andruni maamalon main dakhal na di jaye or samanta va aapasi laabh ke aadhaar par shantipurna sashastitv barkarar rakhaa jaye
 These principles have been accepted by many countries of the world and are recorded in international conferences and documents on bilateral relations
 panchasheel ke itihaas kii charchaa main bharat sthit purv chini rajdoot shri chhan re shan ne bataaya, dwitiya vishvayuddh se pehle, asia va africa ke bahut kam deshon ne swatantraaa hasil kii thi
 However, after the Second World War, the colonial system began to disintegrate
 bharat va myenmar ne swatantraaa praapt kii or baad main china ko bhi mukti mili
 Being the first to achieve independence in Asia, he found it imperative to maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries, and he needed the principle of directing the relations of different countries
 isliye, in teen deshon ke netaaon ne milakar panchasheel kaa aahvaan kiya
 Panchsheel made constructive contributions to the theoretical and real proceedings of international relations
 purv bhartiya raashtrapati narayanan ne panchasheel kii mahatvata kii charchaa is tarah kii
 Panchsheel still holds great importance
 vah kaaphi samay se deshon ke sambandhon ke niptaare kaa nirdeshak maapdand rahaa he
 To establish a peaceful world, it is very important to implement Panchsheel

 People have recognized that Panchsheel is beneficial for peace and cooperation and fully matches international laws and norms
 aaj kii duniya main parivartan ho rahe hai
 The propagation of Panchsheel is very beneficial for solving some of today's problems
 isliye, panchasheel aaj bhi ek shantipurna vishwa vyavastha kaa aadhaar he
 It has a heavy meaning and importance even today and will remain so in the future
 shanti va vikaas kii khoj karnaa vartmaan duniya kii janata kii samaan abhilaashaa he
 Panchsheel's ideology of peace and development has led to the healthy development of international relations and in future also it will play an important role in establishing a peaceful, stable, just and fair new international order

 Although there has been a huge improvement in relations between China and India, there have been some unsolved problems in their relations
 china va bharat ke bich sab se badi samasyaayein seemaa vivaad or tibet kii hai
 The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the problem of Tibet
 varsh 2003 main bhartiya pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ne china kii yatra kii or chini pradhanmantri van chaa paao ke saath ek sanyukt ghoshnaptr jari kiya
 In the manifesto, India formally stated that India considers Tibet a part of China

 In addition to this, the border problem between China and India has also remained unresolved for a long time

 In the year 2003, former Indian Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee made a successful visit to China
 china va bharat ne china-bharat sambandhon ke siddhant or chaturmukhi sahyog ke gyaapan par hastakshar kiye
 Such memos have rarely been issued in the history of diplomatic relations between China and its neighboring countries

 This manifesto of China and India also clarifies that the Tibet Autonomous Region is an integral and integral part of China
 seemaa samasya ke hal ke liye china va bharat ke vishesh pratinidhiyon ke str par salaah-mashvira jari he
 In the year 2004, China and India established this Special Representative Dialogue on the border problem
 bharat sthit purv chini rajdoot chyo kong ne kaha, itihaas se chhuti samasya kii ore hamen bhavishyonmukh rukh se prasthaan karnaa chahie
 The Chinese government has taken an active stand to resolve the border problem

 It is believed that when both sides depart from the desire of mutual trust, reconciliation and concession, then the sino-india border problem will be discovered by searching for ways

 Several standard sizes of paper have been given at different times and in different countries, but today a broader international ISO standard and a local standard used in North America are used
 kaagaz ke aakaar kaa antarrashtriya maanak iesao 216, iske liye german diien 476 maanak par aadhaarit he
 All of the paper's ISO standards are based on a aspect ratio of size 2, or approximately 1: 1
4142
 kaagaj ke buniyadi A0 aakaar ko ek varg meter kshetrafal ke saath paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 With the ratio of a given aspect of a square root of two, it means a piece of paper whose long part is one meter by the square root of a square root of two and the smaller part is the inverse of this value
 millimetre ke rup main badalane par kaagaz kaa A0 aakaar 841 x 1,189 millimetre hota he
 The series of A1, A2, A3 and similar sizes of continuous paper are defined by halving the size of the preceding paper from the length side
 sabase adhik aam taur par istemaal kiya jane vaala kaagaj kaa aakaar he A4 
 The main advantage of this system is its scaling: if a sheet with an aspect ratio of √2 is divided into two equal parts parallel to its smallest part, the aspect ratio of the two halves will again be √2
 Folded brochures of any size can be made using the next larger size sheets, such as A4 sheets used to make A5 brochures
 yah pranali pahalu anupaat se samjhauta kiye bagaiyr ek aakaar se duusare aakaar main scalling kii suvidha detii he - jaisaa ki offis kii photocopy mashiinon dwaara kiya jaataa he yani A4 ko badhaakar A3 karnaa yaa A3 ko gata kar A4 karnaa
 isi prakaar, A4 aakaar kii do shiton ko kisi bhi tarah ke katof yaa haashie ke bina chota kiya ja saktaa he or keval ek shit main feet kiya ja saktaa he
 It also becomes easier to calculate the weight: a standard A4 sheet made of an 80 gram per square meter size paper weighs 5 grams, so that anyone can weigh it - and the corresponding postage rate - in it
 One can easily apply by counting the number of sheets used
 kisi paper ke aakaar ko √2 ke ek pahalu anupaat par aadhaarit karne ke phaaydon kaa ullekh 1786 main german vaigyanik jorge christoff lictenberg dwaara pehle hi kar diya gaya tha
 In the early twentieth century, Dr
 Walter Portman transformed Lichtenberg's idea into a proper system of different sizes of paper
 Portman's system was introduced in Germany in 1922 as a DIN standard, replacing a wider variety of other paper formats
 germany main aaj bhi rosemara ke istemaal main kagaz ke aakaar ko "diien A4" kaha jaataa he
 The DIN 476 standard quickly expanded to other countries and was adopted by the following countries before World War II broke out: dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan is maanak ko urugve, argentina or brazil dwaara apana liya gaya tha; or iske baad yah anya deshon main fail gaya: By 1975, so many countries had started using this German system that it was established as an ISO standard as well as the official UN document
 1977 tak A4 aakaar 148 main se 88 deshon kaa maanak patr praaroop ban gaya tha
 Today, this standard is adopted by all countries of the world except the United States and Canada
 mexico, colombia, venezuela, argentina, chile or philippines main inke dwaara iesao maanak ko aadhikarik taur par apana lene ke baavjood america patr praaroop aaj bhi aam upyog main he
 In addition to the a series, a less frequently used b series also exists
 b shrinkhalaa ke shiton kaa kshetrafal a shrinkhalaa kii nirantar shiton kaa jyamitiya madhyamaan he
 That is why B1 is the size between A0 and A1 with an area of 0
707 square meters
 natijatan B0 kii chaudai ek meter he or b shrinkhalaa ke anya aakaar ek meter kii chaudaai kaa aadha, ek chauthai yaa anya anupaat main hote hai
 Although it is generally used less in office related work, it is used on special occasions
 kai postaron main B-shrinkhalaa ke kagaz yaa iske ek kareebi anupaat kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jaise ki 50 semi × 70 semi; B5, pustakon ke liye apekshaakrit ek saamaanya pasand he
 The b series is also used for envelopes and passports
 si shrinkhalaa kaa upyog keval lipaphe ke liye hi kiya jaataa he or ise iesao 269 main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 The area of C series sheets is the geometric mean of the areas of the same number of sheets of a and b series, for example , the area of a C4 sheet is the geometric mean of the areas of an A4 sheet and a B4 sheet
 iskaa matlab yah he ki C4, A4 se thodaa bada hota he; or B4, C4 se thodaa bada hota he
 Its practical use is that a letter written on A4 paper fits inside a C4 envelope and a C4 envelope fits inside a B4 envelope
 maanak main nirdisht sahishnutaayen nimna hai: The German standard DIN 476 was published in 1922 and is considered the original size for a and b sizes
 yah apane antarrashtriya uttaradhikari se do vivaranon main bhinn he: DIN 476 provides an extension for formats larger than A0, represented by a prefix factor
 yah vishesh rup se do formats ko darshata he - 2A0 jiskaa kshetrafal A0 kaa dugana he or 4A0, jiskaa kshetrafal A0 kaa chaar guna he: DIN 476 also specifies more stringent tolerances: swedish maanak esas 014711 ne A, b or c praroopon kii pranali ke saath D, E, f or g praroopon ko jodakar iesao pranali ko samanyikrut kar diya
 iskaa d praaroop ek b praaroop or agle bade a praaroop ke bich baithta he
 
 The remaining formats fit between all these formats in such a way that the sequence of formats A4, E4, C4, G4, B4, F4, D4, H4, A3 is a geometric evolution, in which the evolution of dimensions from one shape to the next
 2 is based on one aspect of the 1 / 16th part
 haalanki, esas 014711 maanak ek di praaroop or agle bade a praaroop ke bich kisi bhi aakaar ko paribhaashit nahin karata he
 Among these additional formats, the G5 and E5 are popular in Sweden for typographic interpretations, but other formats have not proved particularly useful in practice and have not been adopted internationally
 jeies kagaz ke aakaaron kii do mukhya shrinkhalaaon ko paribhaashit karata he
 The JIS A-series is similar to the ISO A-series, but with slightly different variations
 The area of the B-series paper is 1
5 times that of the corresponding A-size paper, hence the length ratio is approximately 1
22 times the length of the paper of the corresponding A-series
 kaagaj kaa pahalu anupaat A-shrinkhalaa ke kaagaj ke anupaat ke samaan he
 Both a and b series of papers are widely available in Japan, Taiwan and China, and most photocopiers have at least A4 and A3, B4 and B5 papers

 It was prescribed by Herbert Hoover to be used as US government forms when he was Secretary of Commerce, ostensibly so as to get the benefit of discounting paper purchases for schools
 In later years, when copious photocopy machines were produced, people wanted to make copies of the forms, but paper cartons generally did not have papers of this size

 High isotopes of hydrogen are only produced in artificial accelerators and reactors and have a half-life around the order of 10–22 seconds
 neeche die gaye sutara hydrogen ke sabhi teen isotope ke liye maanya hai, lekin prayek hydrogen isotope ke liye Rydberg nirantar kaa thodaa alag maan hona chahie
 In normal chemistry hydrogen is not found without its electron, because ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive
 jab ionized hydrogen ko "ech +" ke rup main likhaa jaataa he, jaise ki hydrochloric acid, hydronium aayan, ech 3 o +, kaa shastreey acid ke uddhaar ke rup main, ek shabdic ionized ekal hydrogen parmaanu nahin he us sthiti main, acid protocol ko H2O + H3O + ke liye sthanantarit karata he Ionized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, interstellar medium, and solar wind are common

 This immediately posed a problem as to how such an arrangement could be stabilized
 Classical electromagnetism had shown that any faster charge emits the energy described through the charged Larmor formula
 yadi electron ko ek purna chakra main kaksha mana jaataa he or urja nirantar nirantar karata he, to electron nimna samay ke saath nabhik main teji se sarpil hoga: a0 is the Bohr radius and r0 is the classical electron radius
 agar yah sach he, to sabhi parmaanuon ko turant gir jayega, haalanki parmaanu sthir hone lagate hai
 In addition, a smear of electromagnetic frequencies is omitted in the recurring cycle because the orbits are small
 iske bajaay, parmaanuon ko keval vikiran ke asatat aavritiyon kaa utsarjan karne ke liye manaaya gaya

 It has been observed that if any element is heated, it emits light from a unique spectrum

 This thing is used to estimate the texture and temperatures of astronomical objects located at distances of billions of billions of light-years from the Earth

 Using this, it can be estimated that if each person adopts a certain lifestyle, then how much of the earth will be needed to help humanity

 This number is recalculated every year - three years behind due to the United Nations taking time to collect and publish basic data
 jahaan paristhitik padchihn shabd kaa vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he, vahiin iske maapan ke tareeke bhinn hote hai
 However, standards of calculation are now emerging to give more comparative and consistent results
 paristhitik padchihn ke bare main pehla shaikshanik prakaashan 1992 main wiliam ris dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The concept of ecological footprint and method of calculation was developed in 1990–1994 at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, under the supervision of Rees, phd dissertation of Methis Wackernagel
 mulat: vaikaranajel or ris ne is avadharana ko "apropreated kariing capacity" kaha
 To make the concept more accessible, Rees introduced the name "ecological footprint", inspired by a computer technician's appreciation of his new computer's "small footprint on the table"
 1996 kii shuruyaat main vaikaranajel or ris ne ower ichological footprint: ridusing human impact on da arth pustak kaa prakaashan kiya
 Ecological footprint analysis compares human demand on nature to reproduction of the biosphere's resources and ability to provide services

 At the end of a survey the footprint values are classified for coal, food, housing, and materials and services, as well as the total footprint number of the Earth that is needed to maintain the world's population at that level of consumption
 yah drushtikon ek utpaada ke nirmaan yaa car ko chalaane jaisi gatividhi par bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 This resource accounting is similar to life cycle analysis in which energy, biofuels, building materials, water and other resources are converted into generalized measurements of land, known as 'global hectares'
 prati vyakti paristhitik padchihn, upbhog auki jivan style kii tulana karne or is upbhog ko pradaan karne kii prakruti kii kshamta jaanchane kaa ek saadhan he
 This tool can inform the governance policy by examining the extent to which a country uses more than what is available in its border or the extent to which the lifestyle of the country will be exemplary at the global level
 padchihn, vyaktigat vyavhaar ko sudhaarney ke uddeshy se logon ko prabhaar kshamta or adhik-khapat ke bare main shikshit karne ke liye bhi ek upyogi upkaran ho saktaa he
 The ecological footprint can be used to argue that many current life styles are not sustainable

 The WWF claims that the human footprint on the planet is 20% greater than bio-capacity

 dakshin landan main pibody trust ke liye bill danster vaastukar or sthirataa salaahkaar bioriginal ne bedzed, ek 96 gharon vaale mishrit aay vaale awaas viksit kiye
 Despite being inhabited by related "mainstream" homebuyers, bedzed's footprint was found to be 3
20 gha due to the presence of recycled energy production, energy efficient architecture and a dense green lifestyle program that included London's first car sharing club

 Several countries are engaged in research collaboration to test the validity of this method

 However, this should not be surprising since both rules raise different research questions

 This is because these communities have a small amount of intrinsic biological capacity and should instead rely on large hinterland

 Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for self-sustaining economies
 kuch log vichaaron kii is shrinkhalaa ko ek kadam or aage le jate hai, is daawey ke saath ki padchihn, vyapaar ke laabh se inkaar karte hai
 Therefore, critics argue that the footprint can only be applied globally

 For example, ancient forestlands or tropical forests with single-yield forests or plantations can improve the ecological footprint
 isi prakaar, yadi jaivik krishi kii paidaavaar, paaramparik vidhiyon kii tulana main kam hoti he, to ho saktaa he ki is kaaran se jaivik ko vrihad paristhitik padchihn ke saath "dandit" kiya jaae
 This insight, while valid, stems from the idea of using the footprint as the sole metric for someone
 agar paristhitik padchihn ke upyog ko anya sanketako ke saath joda jaataa he to, jaise jaev vividhta ke liye, is samasya ko hal kiya ja saktaa he
 In fact, the Living Planet Report of the WWF complements the biennial footprint calculation of the Living Planet Index of Biodiversity

 Although pre-2008 ecological footprint models treat nuclear energy in the same way as coal energy, the real-world impact of the two is fundamentally different

 This is 11 g / kwh for hydroelectric power, 950 g / kwh for installed coal, 900 g / kwh for oil and 600 g / kwh for natural gas production in the United States in 1999
 swedish wetenfol suvidha ne nabhikeey, hydro, koyala, gas, saura cell, peet or pawan ke sampoorn jivan chakra ke utsarjan kaa adhyayan kiya, jiskaa upyog yah suvidha bijli ke utpaadan ke liye karti he
 The net result of the study was that nuclear energy produced 3
3 grams of carbon dioxide per kw-hr of the energy produced
 yah prakritik gas ke liye 400 or koyala ke liye 700 he 
 is adhyayan main yah bhi nishkarsh nikaala gaya ki nabhikeey urja unke kisi bhi urja sroton ke CO2 kii nunatam maatra kaa utpaadan karti he
 There are claims that nuclear waste problems do not approach the problem of fossil fuel waste
 2004 main BBC ke ek lekh main kaha gaya: "vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar vaahan or audyogic utsarjan se hone vaale bahya vaayu pradooshan se duniya bhar main salanaa 3 lakh log marate hai or thos eendhan ke istemaal se hone vaale gharelu pradooshan se 1

 "fossil fuel waste in the US alone kills 20,000 people per year
 nabhikeey urja sanyantr ke samaan wat kshamta vaala ek koyala urja sanyantr, usase 100 guna adhik vikiran utsarjit karata he
 It is estimated that during 1982, the US coal burning incident left 155 times more radioactivity in the atmosphere than the three-mile Iceland event
 In addition, fossil fuel waste is a cause of global warming leading to increased deaths from hurricanes, floods and other seasonal events

 In their comparison, deaths per tw-yr of electricity generation between 1970 and 1992, 885 for hydropower, 342 for coal, 85 for natural gas, and 8 for nuclear are cited

 In his compositions, he has always done new and original-linguistic experiments, which in addition to 'miraculous' the reader, are especially meaningful in terms of inventing a particular genre in modern writing of Hindi

 Vaid, a resident of 'vasant Kunj' in South Delhi, has been living in the United States for a long time with his writer wife Champa Vaid and two married daughters
 krishna baldev vaid apane do kaaljayi upanyaason- uskaa bachapan or vimal urf jaaen to jaaen kahan ke liye sarvaadhik charchit hue hai
 In one meeting he said- "dulness is given great importance in literature

 The alam is that a wet tone and a smiling smile is preferred

 mujh par videshi lekhakon kii nakal kaa aarope lagaaya gaya, lekin main apni avhelnaa yaa kisi bahasabaaji main nahin padaa
 Now i am 82 and as a writer i believe that i could not do any harm
 jaisaa likhnaa chahta, vaisaa likhaa
 As if you want to experiment
 " Vaidji's creation-world is huge - full of rich and varied experiences
 isamen hindi ke liye bhashaa or style ke anekanek nae, anuthe, nihaayat moulik or bilkul tazaa prayog hai
 One of the most important and important writers of our time, Vaid ji is not only his contemplation by taking questions like morality, modesty and language, but in his entire writings, he is an idolatrous composer who breaks the boundaries of genocides very diligently
 hindi ke hit main yah arajak todphod nahin, ek suvyavasthit sochi-samajhi pahal he- rachanaatmak aatm-vishwaas se bhari
 Even after taking the risk of rejection, the few writers who have crafted their craft, narrative and style of saying are often innovative in every work, in which Vaidji often appears like a different discordant-tone in his works in unexpected ways
 vinod or vit, urdudaan layaatmakataa, anuprasi chata, tuk, nirarthakta ke bheetar sangati, aadhuniktaa- ye sab vaid ji kii bhashaa main milte hai
 Fearless experiment - devotion to Vaid ji the inner darkness-light, life-death, joys-sorrows, apprehensions, fears, doubts, unhappiness, boredom, boredom, desires, dreams, fears; Intimacy within everyone gives a break
 manushya kii aatma ke andhkaar main kisi andekhee ujaale kii khoj karte vah apni raah ke akele hamasafar hai- anuthe or moolyawaan
 It would be relevant to quote here the editorial commentary written by Hemant Shesh on his story-journey - "krishna Baldev Vaid is such a modern creator of Hindi, despite a long period of migration abroad, in which language and writing-as a rite The mind of Hindustani is left
 apni har aupnyasik-kriti main vah agar har baar mulya-drushti kii akhandit bhartiya ekaatmakataa ke uparaant bhi pehle se bhinn nazar aate hai, to yah unke anubhav or rachanaatmak-sampannataa kaa hi punarsakshya he jo hamen har baar nae dhang se yah batalaata he ki usamen apane samaaj or apane samay- donon ko har baar nae dhang se dekhe-pahachaane gaye bhashaai rishton main saamne laane kii atoot pratigya he
 Not surprisingly, most of his compositions do not consider the western locale and mindset as prolific, as some well-known Hindi storytellers have consistently done
 iske thik ulate, krishna baldev vaid, hamaare apane desh ke theth madhyamvargeey-man ko, pravaas ke tathakthith prabhaavon se jaise jaan boojh kar bachaate hue, apni un smritiyon, sarokaaron or vidambnaatmak sthitiyon ko hi baarambaar khangalate hai, jo ek badalte hue samaaj or aadhunik manushya ke bheetar ghumad rahi hai
 These can be memories - of depression of loneliness, of natural desperation arising from feelings of insecurity, of complexities of relationships and of their hollowness, of ironic men struggling with ironic situations, of intellectual analysis of fretfulness
 In short, it is the linguistic individualism that explores the essence of human existence, the same arrogant and fierce questionnaire, which keeps a writer creative, awake and experimenting in language
 lekhak, jiske saahitiyik-anveshanon or paryvekshanon ke ujaas main ham swayan ko aise apurvamey konon se dekh sakate hai, jo sirf ek rachana ke zariye hi sambhav ho sakate hai
 His writing is a reflection of the irrationality of a departed writer, uncomfortable and mysterious to others, but a kind of intimate, familiar, intimate language house for the author himself
 It is not enough and true to say that Vaid is not just an Indian writer in his works, but more than that he is a rational modern writer who, due to his intellectual-sharpness, perseverance and unshakeable beliefs, is familiar with the familiar narrative of Hindi literature
 Breaking, jerking and changing
 unki prayogkamita ajasr he or prachlit ke prati aruchi asandigdh
 He is a writer devoted to expression on his own terms, for whom, if important, only the defense of the authorship — identity, thinking, and linguistic individualism — that makes him such a narrator of the 'form' of his own way — that makes any criticism Does not fit in the convenient slot
 All of his writing is a challenge to simplified interpretations in a popular-review manner
 unke jaise apane samay ke lekhan kii pahchaan or punarmoolyankan zaruri he
 Not only because relatively little has been written on such creators and relatively less pithy, but also because there is also a deep moral responsibility of the culture-society among which writers like Krishna Baldev Vaid have been quietly thriving and Has been making them prosperous
 inke katha-sangrah 'badachal biviyon kaa dweep' par hemanth shesh kii bhoomika ke liye dekhen- Prabhat Ranjan, the poet and editor of Janaki Pul, an e-magazine, wrote some commentary on Vaid
 lagbhag 85 saal kii umr main hindi ke prakhyat kathakaar-upanyaaskaar krishna baldev vaid kii kahaniyon kii do sundar kitabon kaa ek saath aana sukhad kaha ja saktaa he
 Pleasant also because one of these 'khali Kitab ki Jadoo' is a compilation of his new stories
 doosraa sankalan he ‘pravaas ganga’, jise unki pratinidhi kahaniyon kaa sanchayan bhi kaha ja saktaa he, vaise puri tarah se nahin
 penguin-yatra prakaashan se prakashit in kitabon ne ek baar phir krishna baldev vaid ke lekhan kii ore dhyaan khinchaa he
 Krishna Baldev has his own leaks in the Hindi literature of Vaid, so he has a different place
 jin dinon hindi sahitya main bahya-yatharth ke ankan ko katha-upanyaas main ‘hit’ hone kaa sabase bada formula mana jaataa rahaa unheen dinon unhone ‘uskaa bachapan’ jaisaa upanyaas likhaa, jisane nihsandeh unke lekhan ko ek alag hi pahchaan di
 apane lekhan ke madhyam se unhone ek tarah se hindi kahani kii mukhyadhara kahi janevaali yathartwaadee kahaniyon kaa pratipaksh taiyaar kiya jisamen sthulata nahin sookshmata par bal he
 Stories are a medium for them to get deep into the world of the mind, to deal with questions related to existence, to understand them
 His stories in a highly publicized narrative created a space of privacy which was recognized as a distinct trend in Hindi
 aaj bhi pahachaani jaati hai
 Talking about his new collection of stories 'khali Kitab Ki Jadoo', he can also be identified in the same leaks, which have descriptions of the subconscious, not of Chetan, but there is no planned narrative in their stories, but where the narrative comes
 She takes the form of parody
