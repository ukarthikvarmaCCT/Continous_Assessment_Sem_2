 islamic darshan : arab darshan, jise zyada sahi taur par muslim darshan kaha jaataa he, mukhyat: greek darshan ke prabhavakshetra main teji ke saath viksit hota hua chaar mukhya ayaamon main prakat hota he : a brief description of these various schools of thought is presented below: yah vichaar sampradaay hijri sanwat kii pratham shatabdi kaa ant hote hote sthapit hua
 It was based on two great principles - divine unity and divine justice
 ishwariya ekatv se yah abhipraay tha ki ishwar ek he -usamen dwaitata kii gandh tak nahin mil sakati
 It has no other qualities beyond its 'origin'
 uskaa apana satv hi sabhi gunon kii lakshyapurti karata he
 He is omniscient and omnipotent, but it is not because he has any qualities of omnipotence or omnipotence separated from his authority or entity, but it is because his origin itself contained the characteristics known as these qualities
 is
 is mat kaa pratipaadan is sampradaay ke pravartak vaasil bin' ata ne kiya tathaa abdul hudhail allaaf ne isaki suspasht vyakhya kii 
 The meaning of divine justice is that God is always just and never cruel
 isi vishwaas kii ek upashakha kii yah manyata he ki ishwar ne manushya ko ek seemaa tak ichaswatantray evam kaary kii swatantraaa se vibhooshit kiya
 Man is responsible for all his actions, he gets rewards for his misdeeds and punishment for misdeeds
 mu'tazli log apane ko 'ahl at tavhid val adl' kehete the kyonki ve ishwar ke nyaay evam ekatv ke drudh samarthak the
 The other major views of Mu'tazli were the denial of the Quran's perpetuity and the inability of God to appear in the hereafter
 puraatanapanthi yah maanate the ki vivek ishwar kaa gun he
 And that is expressed in the Quran
 yon quran swayambhu he or vah ishwar kii shashvatata se sambhddha he
 mu'tazli says that if this knowledge is related to the eternalness of God, then it means two eternal truths existed
 duusare shabdon main kahen to isse do ishwaron kii satta maanya ho jaati he
 The archivists believed that it is possible for at least some people to have a vision of God in heaven and this would be a matter of ultimate bliss
 mu'tazaliyon kaa kahana tha ki swarg main bhi ishwar nahin dikhaai de saktaa kyonki aisa hona is baat kii purvakalpana karnaa he ki is vistaar main vah bhi kuch jagah gherta he
 But God is not expansionary, so he can never be seen anywhere
 mu'tazaliyon ne islam ke rudh niyamon kaa udaattikaran acchhee bhaavana se prerit hokar shuru kiya tha kintu quran kii daivi utpatti ke sambandh main unamem se bahuton kii aasthaa anjaane main hill uthi
 As a result, they were forced to disobey many orthodox rules of religion, such as the doctrine of Ilham, etc
, due to their own rationale
 mu'tazli vichaarkon kaa pehla dal apane majahab ke prati jaagruk tha or maanviya vivek buddhi ke saath sangati bithaane ke liye uskaa udaattikaran chahta tha
 The sect of Mu'atzali was born untouched by external influences
 
 But when the Greek philosophy came into translation, the Mu'tazalis read it with great enthusiasm
 greek darshan ke adhyayan ne inke man main nai nai samasyaayen utpann kin or dharm main unki abhiruchi swat: uski hi khatir peeche thel di gai
 Some of the chiefs were Nuzam Jubba 'e, Zahiz, etc
 ash'aravaad, mut'zlwaad ke viruddh ek pratikriyaatmak andolan he
 Abdul Hasan al-ash'ari was its founder
 inkaa janm 260 yaa 270 hijri main basra main hua tha or ye mu'tazleey shivi main hi prashikshit the
 He was a Mu'tazladi till the age of 40 years
 inke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki inhen swapn main paigambar ke darshan hue the jinamein unhone inako quran tathaa haddees ke niyamon par chalane ke liye uksaaya tha
 He vowed to do so and decided to fight with all his might
 saarvajanik shastrarth main inhone apane guru jubba'i se bahes kii or unhen parrast kiya
 He wrote more than a hundred books in contradiction of E'tishal
 ye ishwariya vastuon ke sambandh main kisi bhi aise gyaan se inkaar karte the jo ilham se apni swatantra satta rakhata ho
 He believed that the building of theology could not be built on purely rational grounds
 ve mu'tazliyon ke is mat ko ki ishwar nirgun he, asweekaar karte the
 He believed that God is endowed with diverse qualities, such as knowledge, desire, power, etc
; But all these cannot be understood in the sense of the qualities found in humans
 quran ke sambandh main unka mat tha ki vah ishwar kii shaashvat vaani he
 With respect to freedom of will or determination, he was established that a human being cannot produce anything
 ishwar hi ekmaatr srashta yaa sirajanhaar he
 God inculcates the caste qualities of choice and power in humans, then creates those activities that align with election and power
 prerak sirf vahi ishwar he
 What lies in the power of man, it is only 'town', which means that man's actions are in accordance with his qualities of choice and power which God has already created in him
 manushya ishwar ke kaaryon kaa lakshyabindu he
 Mu'tazli established that God could not destroy his creatures by being a judge
 ishwar ne manushya ko karm kii swatantraaa di he
 Therefore, not God but man himself is the creator of good and bad acts
 is drushtikon ko galat sabit karte hue al-ashari ne yah mat prastut kiya ki ishwar kisi seemaa main nahin bandhaa he
 He can interest or harm any of his creatures according to his will
 paralok main ishwar kaa saakshaatkaar ho sakane ke sambandh main unka mat yah tha ki bhautik drushti se yah avashya hi asambhav he, kyonki isse sthal vishesh evam disha kaa sambandh he, phir bhi uskaa darshan bhautik netron kii sahaayta ke bina kiya ja saktaa he
 As DB macdonal says, 'al-ash'ari's great fundamental wisdom laid the foundation for a powerful system of philosophical theology and laid the foundation for the scientific foundation of' scholasticism '
 ' Sufism teaches how to sanctify our consciences, how to strengthen our moral plane and to build our inner and outer lives so that eternal bliss can be achieved
 aatma kii shuddhi hi isaki vishaywastu he, tathaa isaki parinti evam lakshya he shaashvat paramanand or param krupa kii prapti sufi yah sweekaar karte hai ki ishwar dwaara apane bandon par aropit unke pavitra ganth ke sabhi adhinium tathaa paigambar dwaara sujhaaye gaye sabhi kartavya aise aavashyak anubandh hai jinke bandhan main sabhi vayaskon evam praudh mastishkwaalon kaa bandhna jaruri he
 Sufism in this sense is a purely Islamic discipline that builds the inner life and character of Muslims through duties and acts, contracts and imperatives that no person can bypass in any way
 kintu islam main sufiwaad kaa yahi samoochaa arth nahin he
 It has a mysterious intent
 duniya ke rahasywaadee arth main sufi vahi he jise apane tathaa ishwar ke bich sthit sachche sambandh kii jaankaree he
 Thus the Sufi knows that he is an idea intrinsically situated in the mind of God
 vichaar hone ke kaaran ishwar ke saath saath vah bhi saarvkalik he
 Outwardly, he is a created being, in the form of which God reveals himself according to the Sufi functionality
 vah na to apana koi swatantra nijee astitv rakhata he or na koi sattatmak gun hi 
 He has power by the power of God, he sees through God, he hears through God
 is abhipraay kii pushti quran ke is paath se hoti he : 'vahi pratham he or antim he, vahi bahya he or abhyantar he or vah sab kuch jaanata he' 
 Analyzing this verse, the Prophet said: 'you are external and nothing is above you; You are the interior and nothing below you; You are first and nothing before you; You are the last and there is nothing after you
 ' Persian scholar Jami, a very prominent Sufism official, says that the first interpreter of the mystical Sufism was the Egyptian resident Dhun Nun
 dhunash nun ke abhigyaan ko baghdaad ke junayd ne sankalit env vyavasthit kiya
 Junaid's view was strongly publicized by his disciple, Abu Bfr Shibli of Khorasan
 ye abhigyaan abu naratra sarraj dwaara pustak 'luma' main lipibaddh hue, taduparant abdul kasim al qushairi ne inhen apni pustak 'rasel' main rakhaa
 But the person who kept this system in Islamic mystics and rules them out was the great mystic Sheikh Muhiuddin ibn-ul-arab
 yah aap hi the jinhone chha: 'alaayaton' athwa 'visheshikarnon' kii yojana samajhaaii or aise har abhivyakti ke sambhddha vishyon kaa nishchay kiya
 He was the founder of the famous sect known as Vazuddiyyah
 imam gazali ne sufiwaad ko vaigyanik swaroop pradaan kiya
 Due to its widespread influence, antiquarian Sufism became associated with Sunni theology and since then it has made its place in it
 islam ke abhyuday ke purv purab ke kuch sthal yatha, faras main jandishapur, mesopotamia main harni tathaa misr main alexandria apni helenic samskruti ke kaaran vikhyath the
 From these places Hellenic scholasticism was infected among the people of the east
 omaid kaal ke arab samrajyavaadee gaiyr-arbiyon ke saath khulkar milane main apni hethi samajhate the
 With the rise of Abbasis, the people of the conquered and conquered caste started meeting and exchanging views
 greek vidya ko muslim vidwaanon ke bich failaane main almamoon ne pahalakadami kii
 The Arabs 'interaction with Greek civilization and philosophy, rather than mere general eclipse of Greek philosophy, was a' gradual development of that fundamental system of ideas, which was specifically dictated by the philosophical trends already existing in the Arab world
 ' The first eminent Muslim philosopher was Abu Yakub Alakindi
 vishuddh rajwanshi arab hone ke naate inhone 'pratham arab darshanik' kii spruhaniya oopaadhi arjeet kii
 He translated many texts of philosophy from Greek to Arabic and revised other available translations
 unke granth kesh praaia: 266 sheershak hamen praapt hai
 Al Kindi should be considered the initiator of secular prudence in Islam
 gyanakshetra kaa koi bhi vibhaag unki satark buddhi ke pareekshan se batch nahin paaya tha
 In his original thought-provoking texts, 'thematic Management' and 'five Basic Elements' are of great importance
 al-kindi ne buddhi ke chaturmukh vibhaag kaa siddhant sthapit kiya; yah arestu ke 'di enema' main prapya nahin
 Many scholars tried in vain to know their original origin
 mi0 gilson kaa vichaar he ki yah afrodysius ke sikandar dwaara rachit di anika se ni:sruth he, kintu usamen keval teen vibhaagon kii charchaa he
 The importance of al-kindi is that he was the first Muslim thinker to accumulate and develop the psychological content of Greek philosophers
 al-kindi kii sarvaadhik mahatv vaali pustika 'paanch mul tatwon' par he jisamen padaarth, rup, gati, kaal evam vistaar vishyak paanch sthitiyon kaa varnan he
 Nearly all European writers have described him as a staunch Mu'tazalist, but based on some of his recently discovered books in Kustuntunia, he can never be called Mu'taljwadi in the true sense
 al farbi : islam ke sabase mahan darshanik tathaa navy platowadi farbi plato or arestu ke darshanon ke sarvottam vishleshak maane jate hai
 In the words of Evan Khallikan, 'no Muslim has reached the rank of Al Farabi in the field of philosophical sciences; Avisina attained such expertise only after studying her creations and following her style and automatically made her own creations
 ' arestu ko unhone itani purnataa ke saath samajha tathaa greek darshan ke rahasyon kaa udghaatan itani vyapaktaa ke saath kiya ki ve muslimon dwaara 'duusare ustad' kehalaae kyonki pehle ustad swayan arestu the
 Despite all his zeal for Aristotle, he was also fascinated by the new Platonic beliefs about origins
 unka vishwaas tha ki yah vishwa, ishwar se utpann hokar avarohatmak dhang se neeche tak aayaa he
 The greatest Jewish philosopher Mabhonidis uttered these words while writing his recommendation about the books of logic of Al Farabi
 'main tumhen tarkshastrasambandhi anya koi pustak padhane ko na kahkar darshanik abu nasar al farvi kii kritiyon ko padhane kii sanmati doongaa
 Al Farabi states that 'the incorporation of common truths is possible only after specific truths have been distinguished, and emotional knowledge can only be the culmination of knowledge gained by sensory experiences
 jahaan tak buddhivaale siddhant kaa prashn he, al farbi apane purvadhikari al-kindi kaa anusaran karte hue chaar prakaar kii buddhi kii charchaa karte hai, yatha, gupt athwa prasupt buddhi, kriyanishth buddhi, arjeet buddhi tathaa madhyam gyaan Al Farabi explains his theory of causality in a detail called 'gyan-ratna'
 arestu kii bhanti inaki bhi yah manyata he ki kaarnon kii shrinkhalaa anant nahin he, udgamon kii ananthata asambhav he
 The first reason is one more eternal
 pratham kaaran ek aavashyak satta hai jiskaa astitv duusare astitvon ke akalan ke liye aavashyak he
 This cannot be realized by any human knowledge
 uski mulsatta agam apaar he
 It is here that Al Farabi seems to mix philosophical theories well with the mysticism that was developing so rapidly under the religion of Asian Islam
 ibne sina - inkaa adhyayan sarvagyanatmak tha
 He was a good doctor and great philosopher
 inkaa darshan navy platowad kaa halkaa sa prabhaav liye hue arestu ke siddhanton kaa angikaran tha
 Among the vast number of texts written by him, 'al Shifa', which was an encyclopaedia of physics, philosophy and mathematics, was the most prominent
 iskaa vistaar 18 bhaagon main he 
 Ibn Sina also prepared an abbreviated version of 'alshifa', named 'najat' under which he presented the statements of Galen and Hippocrates in their own way
 ebn sina ke anusaar tarkshastra kaa lakshya logon ko kuch aise maandand prastut karnaa he jiske aadhaar par ve apane tark vitarkon main gumraah hone se batch sakate hai
 He divides his thesis on logic into nine parts which corresponds to the Arabic version of Aristotle
 is granth main tathaa chandashastra evam kavyashastra bhi sanmilit he
 Ibn Sina emphasizes that serious reasoning always depends on defining something exactly
 paribhaasha main vastu ke gun, uski mul jati, uske vyavachhedak dharm tathaa uske vishisht lakshanon ko spasht karnaa chahie; is prakaar vah kore varnan se bilkul pruthak cheez he
 While referring to the common and special, Ibaj Sina states that the existence of the common remains only in the human mind
 yah ek prakaar kaa amoort pratyay he jo keval maansik bodh ke rup main hi rahata he or uski koi vastunishth yatharthata nahin hoti
 The conclusion of common sense is the same as that of a particular person or person, as it was in the mind of the creator before the creation of the person as a general suffix
 padaarthon main saamanyata kaa bodh tabhi hota he jab vishisht gunon se uskaa sahyog hota he
 In the absence of these specialties, it is merely a mental suffix
 aatma, ebn sina ke anusaar, kshamtaaon athwa prerak shaktiyon kaa sangrah he
 The simplest soul is that of vegetation, whose activity is limited to nutrient ingestion and reproduction
 pashuon kii aatma main vanaspati kii kshamtaaon main sivaa kuch or baaten bhi rahati hai
 Similarly, other things increase except in humanism and it is called 'intellectual soul'
 gyaan yaa bodh kii shaktiyaan anshat: bahari or anshat: aantarik hoti hai
 External powers reside in the body, within which the soul resides
 inaki sankhya aath he jinhen indriya gyaan kah sakate hai, dekhne kii, sunne kii, swaad kii, gandh kii, shakti tathaa sheet-taap-bodh, shushkta-ardrata-bodh, komal kathor avarodhon kaa bodh or rukshata suchikkanta kaa bodh
 All these realizations together give a conceptual knowledge of the nature of the external matter to the soul of the mind
 indriyabodh kii aantarik shaktiyaan nimnlikhit hai : Al Mussabira, Al Mufakira, Al Wahm, Al Hafiza or Al Zakira
 manushyon evam pashuon ko visheshon kaa bodh indriyon dwaara hota he, manushya saamaanya kaa gyaan buddhi shakti dwaara karata he
 a man's intellectual soul or 'wisdom' has knowledge of his own powers, separate from physical powers
 ise ek pruthak evam swatantra satta ke rup main manyata dena thik hoga, yadhyapi sanyogvash sharir se iskaa sah sambandh he
 As far as physics is concerned, Ibn Sina discusses the forces of nature, which are of three types - such as gravity which is an essential element of the body in which these powers are found - those powers which remain outside the body They also have an effect on them, such as the cause, the speed or the stop and apart from them the powers that produce the motion directly without any external stimulus
 koi bhi shakti aseem nahin he, inhen ghataya badhaayaa ja saktaa he tathaa inke parinaam hameshaa aseem hote hai
 Although time or time itself is not motion, it can be measured and measured with the help of the movement of constellations
 al kindi kaa anusaran karata hua ebn sina sthaan kii paribhaasha is tarah prastut karata he 'ki yah aadhaan kii vah seemaa he jo dhaarit yaa samavisht se jaakar milti he', tathaa jise ham shunya kehete hai, vah keval ek naam tathaa asambhavit vastu he
 Ibn Sina considers God to be 'essential authority' and divine
 bhautik vigyaanon main jin padaarthon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he ve keval sambhavit 'vastuen' hai
 In the entire infinite, only one God necessarily exists
 darshan kaa prayojan ishwar ko jaananaa or jitna sambhav ho sake, utana usee ke samaan hona he
 According to Ibn Sina, we can achieve this through education and divine divine vision
 gyarahavin sadi ke mode par aakar purv main arabi darshan ek ant par aa pahunchataa he
 Al Ghazali directly opposes the teachings of philosophers in his book 'tahafat ul Falasifa' for the interest of religion and denies even the ability of philosophy to reach the truth
 use darshanik paddatiyon main vyakti ke amartv kaa siddhant tathaa ishwar ke purvagyaan evam purvavidhan main vishwaas kii baat dikhaai nahin detii jiske dwaara aisa mana jaataa he ki ishwar jivan kii choti choti ghatnaon ko pehle se hi jaanata he or unhen pehle hi dekh le saktaa he tathaa kisi bhi samay unamem hastkshep kar saktaa he
 The publication of the impact of Al Ghazali's book silenced philosophers
 arabi darshan ne phir bhi apana astitv kaayam rakhaa or spain moore khalipha tantra main failaa
 In particular, it spread in Kardova, a famous educational place and where Muslims, Jews and Christians used to sit and read without any interference

 vilupt hoti banjaaraa lok-samskruti People generally consider folk culture as synonymous with 'rural culture', whereas it is the culture of all those who are part of a community which has some traditions and beliefs
 lok samskruti main baraabar samay ke saath badlaav aate he
 Just as folk songs never come to a standstill, they come out of the person whose throat is broken, in the same way, something is added and happening in the folk culture
 par is saare jod ghataav ke baad bhi uski mul sugandhi jyon ki jyon bani rahati he
 According to Dr
 Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, "the meaning of the word Lok is not the district or the village, but the whole population spread in cities and villages, whose practical knowledge is not the basis of books
 ”1vidyanivas mishra lok ko is arth main lene kaa virodh karte he ‘lok’ kaa vyutpattiparak arth he “jo kuch dikhataa he, indriya gochar he, pratyaksh he, saamne he, isi se usamen ek tarah kii samakaleenta or pratyaksh vishyata kaa bodh hota he
 Fok's conception is made in the West
 vah bahut kuch is prakaar kii he ki jo peeche chhot gaya he, jo gavaaru he, jo anpadh logon kii vaachik parampara ke rup main sweekrut he, vah fok he, lekin lok manushya samudaay tak simit nahin karata he, vah bahut vyapak he
 All life which is spread in front, or transitive or enduring is all folk
 ”2 Rajasthan is considered by almost all historians to be the origin of Banjara society
 banjaaraa samaaj yah bharat ke prayek praant main anek naamon se janaa jaataa he
 Such as Banjara in Maharashtra, Lamani in Karnataka, Tallada in Andhra, Baazigar in Punjab, Naik Samaj in Uttar Pradesh and Rani in the outside world
 banjaaraa shabd kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke anek vichaar he
 Indus culture is considered as the most cultured and ancient culture of India
 isi samskruti se judi hui gore-banjaaraa samskruti he
 Different parts of this society are known by different names
 kintu banjaaraa samaaj ke manushya ko har praant main ‘gore’ tathaa ‘gormati’ naam se janaa jaataa he
 Banjara is a person who moves from one place to another to load grain on oxen
 usee vyakti ko ‘banjaaraa’ kaha jaataa he
 This society used to do business since time immemorial
 tab se is jati ko ‘vaanijyakaar’ ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The word 'commerce' is from Sanskrit
 vaanijya shabd ko hi hindi main ‘banaj’ kaha jaataa he tathaa ‘banaj’ se hi banajaara shabd kii vyutpatti hui he
 'banjara' is also known as 'gore'
 ‘banjaara’ shabd mukt jivan jeene ke pratik rup main prayukt kiya jaataa he
 - banjaaraa shabd kii vyutpatti ke sandarbh main dow
grearsan ne- sanskrit ke vaanijya ke saath banajaara shabd kaa sambandh sthapit kiya jaataa he- “vaanijya-vaanijyakaar-vanijjaron-banajaara is tarah kaha jaataa he ki banajaara shabd suchak nahin, vyavsaay suchak he
 "4 In the context of the word Banjara, sociologists Russell and Hiralal hold the view that" Gor "or the Baran people, who were native to Rajasthan, came to be known as Banjara in medieval India
 ”5 The word 'city' is important in the above folklore
 ‘nagari’ kaa arth he- ‘hadappa nagar’
 Banjara Samaj is prayed to God before performing any auspicious task- uparyukt prarthana ke anusaar banjaaraa samaaj kaa rachana kaal ganga saraswati ke pahari pradesh main viksit rahane vaali hadappa samskruti ke kalkhandon main rahakar saraswati kaa parisar hi banjaaraa samskruti kaa mul basti sthaan he
 In Banjara society, women are also called 'harpari'
 ‘harpali’ kaa banjaaraa boli main arth- hadappa kii rahanevaali
 This song appears in this context
 – Most people in the Banjara culture traded only cow and bulls
 jis kaaran banjaaraa samaaj ko ‘gore samaaj’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 People of Harappan culture also used to do farming, trade
 isse spasht hota he ki, banjaaraa jati yah sindhu samskruti tathaa hadappa samskruti ke kaal kii rahi he
 Many of the beliefs of the Indus culture are reflected in the Banjara culture
 sindhu samskruti main prithvi, shing,vrishabh, pashu paalan, lingapuja ko mahatv diya jaataa tha
 Similarly, in the Banjara culture, ‘suraj’ and ‘agni’ are worshiped
 is se spasht hota he, ki banjaaraa shabd ghumantu jati ke sandarbh main prayukt hua he or is jati kii avadharana ke liye us jati ke virgon ke dwaara kiye jane vaale karm, vyapaar or anya samajopayogi karmon se ghumantu jati hone ke kaaran isamen bhashaa or samskruti main ek saamaajikta ko samaai he
 It is also accepted with reference to this caste, that its prevalence is all-country
 itihaas se gyaat hota he ki banjaaraa log pehle se hi vyapaaree vritti ke the tathaa rajasthan ke vyapaaree samudaay se mili hue the
 The states of Rajasthan, Malwa, Gujarat etc
 belonged to the Rajput dynasties
 in pradeshon main vyapaar bade paimaane par chalata tha
 The merchant people of this region used to trade with goods in the country and abroad
 rajasthan ke vyapaaree logon main gujjar, marbari or banjaaraa log adhik prasiddhi paa chuke the
 Due to trade being the only means of living, their economic condition was good
 lekin akbar or rana pratap ke yuddh se inaki aarthik sthiti par vipareet parinaam padaa
 He was a follower of Rana Pratap
 rana pratap ke saath banjaaron ko anek vipattiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Tired of the Mughal emperors and living, they started supplying logistics and munitions to the Mughal forces
 shahjahan ke netritv main dakshin main bijapur ke adilshaah par akraman karne ke liye mughal phujon ke saath 1630 i
 ke lagbhag yah banjaare dakshin kii ore pahunch gaye or kalantar main yah vahi bas gaye
 business “banjaaron ke vyavsaay alag-alag he
 In ancient times, Banjaras collectively used to carry food and other materials from one place to another as a merchant or businessman
 banjaaron ko desh ke chaaron dishaao main dur-dur tak yatra karne ke baad apane mul sthaan par lautnaa sambhav nahin tha
 Both cold and summer seasons are painful for them
 banjaaraa stri-purush apane vyapaar ke liye bail, baiylgadee, oont or ghode kaa prayog karte the banjaare kisi bhi kaam ke liye samuhik rup se jate the
 "9 The Banjara community has always been the victim of persecution, whether it was from the feudal system or the British or from post-independence government policy
 pehle banjaaraa samaaj kaa mukhya vyavsaay namak kaa tha
 The contribution of Banjars in the freedom struggle has always been underestimated
 ghumantu hone kii vajah se yah soochnaaon ke aadan-pradaan kaa behad vishwasaneey jariya the
 Later on 31 December 1859, the British imposed a 'salt Tax Bill' to financially weaken the Banjara Sanudaya
 banjaaraa samudaay ne iskaa virodh pradarshan kiya
 In 1930, he also carried out the Dandi March in protest with Gandhiji
 angrejon ke is faisle se namak ke vyapaaree banjaaron kii qamar tut gai
 Eventually he had to change his ancestral salt business
 uske baad se banjaaraa samaaj aaj tak chote-mote kaam kar jivan-yaapan karte hai
 The men and women of the Banjara society were forced to sell items like gum, Sindha salt, mud multani, mehndi, tools made of iron
 kai ko shaharon kaa rukh karnaa padaa
 Costumes & Jewelry prayek jati kii apni saanskrithik vyavastha hoti he us saanskrithik vyavastha ke peeche us jati kaa pracheen itihaas chipa hota he
 Hence caste can be distinguished from others
 banjaaraa jati kii saanskrithik vyavastha atipracheen tathaa paramparaagat he
 These include their dress system, food system and handicrafts
 banjaaraa samaaj apni veshbhusha ke kaaran puure bharat main ek alag pahchaan rakhata he
 Banjara caste costumes are found very close to the costumes of Rajasthan
 aam taur par banjaaraa purush sir par pagadi baandhte hai
 Wear a shirt or a shirt
 dhoti baandhte hai
 Wearing Narmukhi bracelet in hands, Murkia in ears and bags
 adhiktar yah haathon main lathi liye rahete hai
 The women of Banjara society knit hair beans and tie them in threads with braid
 mahilaayein gale main suhaag kaa pratik dohada pahenti hai
 Bangle in the hands, nose in the nose, silver oganya in the ear, reconstructed in the throat, wadding in the feet, nebbariya, lagna, nettle in the fingers, thumb in the thumb, girdle or kandaura at the waist, armlets, dhodiya, hand-pans and Wears rings kuch mahilaayein ghaghara or lahanga bhi pahenti hai
 The pulpit is covered in a veil
 budhi mahilaayein kaanchali pahenti hai
 Regarding the jewelery of Banjara women, according to Dr
 Sriram Sharma - “banjaran is also very interested in the matter of jewelery, like textiles
 vyavasthit samaaj kii striyaan adhikansh aabhushanon ko vishesh avasaron par pahenti he, kintu banjaaran apane alankaranon ko deh se alag karnaa nahin chaahati
 Like women of other primitive castes, Banjara women also get their jewelery made from cowrie, oyster, duwani chawni etc
 ” food and drink banjaaraa kaa khan-paan anya samaaj se bhinn he
 But the interest of Banjaras and Rajasthanis in food items is the same
 aaj bhi banjaare apane purvajon kii ruchi se dur nahin hai
 The food of Banjara people who live in any corner of India is almost same type
 banjaare shaakaahaari or maansaahaari bhojan lete hai
 The Banjara person appears to have an account in the fast paced behavior
 banjaare ke khan-paan do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is collective eating and the other is individual eating
 samuhik khan-paan yah shubh avasar par yaa dharmik kriya-karm ke samay kiya jaataa he
 Vegetarian food - Banjara caste being of Kshatriya dynasty can be clearly seen the influence of Hinduism on them
 hindu dharm main jo bhojya padaarth banaae jate hai usee prakaar banjaaraa jati bhi bhojya padaarth bamaati he
 Banjara caste being from the original Rajasthan, Rajasthani diet has also affected them
 parantu banjaaraa jati ghumkkad hone ke alag-alag praanton main basii hui he
 Therefore, the influence of the dietary system of that province is also seen on this caste
 roti banjaar jati kii pramukh aahaar hoti he
 In the Banjara dialect, roti is called 'baati'
 baati yah jowar, bajra, makai se banaai jaati he
 'rabadi' is also considered to be the most preferred diet of the Banjara people
 ‘rabadi’ yah vyanjan chacha se banaaya jaataa he
 Apart from this, Banjara people eat porridge, Khodi Poli, Galwali, Lapsi, Suwari Bajra Khichdi, Amra Red Chilli Salon etc
 with great fervor
 mashaari- banjaaraa mulat: jangalvaasi he tathaa inamen shikaar karne kii pravriti paidaaishi hone ke kaaran adhiktar banjaaraa log maance kaa seven karte hue dikhaai dete hai
 Even today, in their daily food, we have food items made of meat once or twice
 maansaahaar ke sivaa in logon ko bhojan adhuraa-sa lagata he
 Originally, Banjara people living in the hills and forests and fond of hunting consume goat, rooster, rabbit, pheasant, wild boar, crab, some, fishes etc
 meat
 junglee suar kii shikaar karke khaane main inhen vishesh anand miltaa he
 a man who hunts a pig is called 'surmati' in the Banjara dialect
 banjaaraa log andhashraddha se grast rahane ke kaaran har parivaar main kisi na kisi devi-devataaon ke naam par bakra ‘bali’ dene kii pratha bhi dekhai detii he
 These people spend more money for goat meat
 inamen devi-devataaon ke naam par maance ke saath sharaab kaa bhi atyadhik seven kiya jaataa he
 customs and traditions banjaaraa dharm pipaasu hai
 Their religious beliefs are related to traditional Hindu religious beliefs
 dharm, puja, vrath, tyohaar, dharmik sanskaron aadi par prabhaav darshaneey he
 Religiously, this community has not yet adopted any one religion in its entirety and has accepted many gods and goddesses in an arbitrary manner and also worships arbitrarily
 hindu hote hue bhi inhone hindu dharm kii kisi ek shakha ko nahin apanaaya he
 The Banjara community also has a fear of nature and the unknown, a primitive sense of awe, whose external appearance is seen in the form of mantra-tantra, witchcraft etc
 inamen agni ke saath jal, jangal bhoomi tathaa nai fasal aadi kii bhi puja kii jaati he
 Banjara considers all the deities like Sevlal, Hambhukya, Mituthukya, Rama, Krishna, Balaji, Tujbhavani, Durgadevi, Sheetaladevi etc
 are their deities
 chhattisgarh ke banjaare ‘banjaaraa’ devi kii puja karte hai, jo is jati kii matrushakti kii dyotak hai
 Dance and folklore bharat main hamen anek jati ke logon main paramparaayen ,lokkalaayen dekhne ko milti hai
 We see that there is a deep connection between human life and art
 manushya apane nity kaamon se ub jane par thakaan mitaane ke liye yaa apane gadhon ko bhulane ke liye sangeet kaa sahaara letaa he
 After getting refreshed with music, he gets involved in his work again
 prayek samudaay kii apni paramparaagat vaadya-saamagree he jo nrity va loakgeet tathaa holi, deepawali, dashahra aadi dharmik devi-devataaon ke utsav ke avasaron par gaae jate hai
 Banjara Samaj is considered very famous for dance, music, rangoli, embroidery, tattooing and painting
 prayek banjaaraa samudaay kii gaanevaalon kii ek toli hoti he, jise banjaaraa boli main ‘gavanya’ yaa ‘gwaal’ ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Their choirs have at least four or five people
 sabhi milakar nrity karte hai
 Dance is the expression of heart feelings by the associates
 angik cheshtaa maatr se hi bhav ko vyakt karne kii kriya arthath nrity jansamanya kii swaabhaavik pravriti kaa suchak he
 The dance has its origin in the pleasure of human beings
 or saath-hi-saath nrity swant: sukhaay hone ke kaaran lokanrutyon main kisi desh yaa jati kii samskruti nihit rahati he
 Similarly, Banjara women dance and sing in the context of marriage, festival etc
 holi main to sabhi banjaare sabhi dwesh-bhav bhulaakar ek jagah aakar holi kaa anand lete hai
 In the Holi festival, we will sing songs
 jaise- Diwali festival It is an important festival of Hinduism
 usee prakaar banjaaron kaa mahatvapurn tyohaar holi he
 Banjare considers Holi and Diwali as flowing
 banjaaraa janajati kii diwaali do din kii hoti he
 Godhan is worshiped in this festival and virgin girls bless all people, animals
 banjaare diwaali ko kaali amavas yaa dawali kehete hai
 Banjaras sacrifice goats on Diwali
 diwaali or holi ke sambandh main yah loakgeet- The tradition of Banjara folklore is found in folk literature since ancient times
 adimanav kii samay main bhi lokgeeton kaa prachlan rahane kii sambhaavna vyakt kii gai he
 Folk songs have been popular ever since humans learned to speak the language
 lokgeeton kii shabd sampada bhashaa ke saath astitv main kaayam he
 That is why Banjara folklore has been running from generation to generation
 loakgeet apni sahajata, saralata or anubhuti kii tivrata se lokmanas ke hriday kii dhadakanon main raag-sangeet bhar detaa he
 His hair gets shaken
 yah loakgeet saamaajik aadan-pradaan kii jeevat yahan mashaal kii tarah roshan karte hai
 These songs can be called the songs of the earth
 isliye yah loakgeet hamaare jivan ke prayek karm ke saath jude hue hai
 Janta songs 'jantasar' songs of paddy planting, songs of marriage, songs of Chhath, songs of Sawan, songs of Holi, songs of Diwali, songs of various gods and goddesses have been inherited from their ancestors
 lokgeeton main keval khushi or utsav hi nahin, balki banjaaraa samaaj main vyaapt visangatiyon par bhi anek loakgeet milte he
 Epilogue sampurna bharat main bhinn-bhinn samaaj jati dharm ke log nivas karte hai, jinamein se ek banjaaraa samaaj he, jiskaa itihaas sadiyon purana he
 The Banjara caste population in India is currently around 6 crores
 yah uttar pradesh ke shahjahanpur, bijanour, pilibhit, bareli, aligarh, muzaffarnagar, itawa, muradabad, muthra, eta, agra, or madhya pradesh ke jabalpur, chhindwara, mandla tathaa gujarat ke panchmahal, kheda, ahmedabad va sarabarkantha kshetron main banjaare kaaphi sankhya main dekhne ko milte hai
 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan, etc
 are found in almost all the provinces
 puure desh main apni ek alag samskruti main jeene vaale is samaaj ko apni vishisht pahchaan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 According to the Indian Constitution, different laws have been enacted in each of the provinces for the development of Banjara society, due to which a Banjara caste has been placed in a Scheduled Tribe by some province, or in the list of Backward Classes or Declared Castes
 desh main banjaaraa samaaj ke liye ek jaisaa kanoon nahin hone ke kaaran yah samaaj aaj bhi vikaas kii mukhya dhara se nahin jud paaya he
 Due to this, people of Banjara caste are living their lives by becoming nomadic for their daily bread
 rajnatik drushti se yah samaaj apni pahchaan tak nahin bana paaya he
 Even today, despite having a population of around 6 crore, Banjara society is still looking for development due to the lack of representation of this society at any province, district and block level
 ab banjaaraa samaaj ko unke adhikaron se unako vanchit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, kyonki banjaaraa samaaj main nav chetana aa rahi he
 He is now getting organized
 ab vah samay aa gaya he ki banjaaraa jati ko sarkari va gaiyr sarkari, rajnatik sanghathanon main unakon pratinidhitiv dena hi padegaa
 With which the path of backward Banjara society has been strengthened for centuries
 samay hote hue yadi shashan str par samaaj kii ore se thos pahal nahin kii jaati he
 The Banjara society will no longer wait for their rights any longer

 Aamir Khan's character will get a special place in a 3-D video game titled Ghajini the Game, which is based on this film
 is film kii kahani medical chaatra sunita or uski sahpathine jo uske saath maanav-mastishk kii ek pariyojna par kaam kar raheen hai, se khulti he
 He wants to investigate the unique condition of Sanjay Singhania, the city's designated trader who suffers from post-operative memory loss
 uske professor sanjay ke abhilekhan tak abhigaman se asweekaar kar dete hai kyonki vartmaan main uske saare aapraadhik tathyon kii jaanch jari he
 Despite this, Sunita decides to conduct the investigation herself
 sanjay ko ek duusare vyakti kii krurta se hatya karata hua pesh kiya jaataa he
 He takes a picture of the person and places the 'executed' seal in his note with the time and date
 aisa darshaya gaya he ki sanjay ko ghatanottar smriti lop kii ek ajeebogareeb beemaari he jisamen uski yaaddaasht har 15 minute ke baad mit jaati he
 Sanjay uses the methods of tattooing, taking notes, and tattooing on his body to return his memory again after every 15-minute cycle
 har subah jab sanjay shauchalay jaataa he, vah vaash basin main nal kii tonti ke paas hi "kameez utaaro" likhaa hua ek note dekhtaa he
 As he takes off the shirt, he sees a series of tattoos on his wide chest
 jab vah "kalpana kii hatya kar di gai thi" guda hua dekhtaa he to ek sire se yah udghaatit ho jaataa he ki sanjay antat kalpana kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye pra tibaddh he or isiilie vah pariklpit tareeke se ek-ek kar un logon ko maar rahaa he jo kalpana kii maut ke jimmedaar the
 The written notes and the pierced tattoos provide clear evidence that its main target is Ghajni
 aakhirkaar yah bhi saafe-saafe jaahir ho jaataa he ki gajani or koi nahin balki shahar kaa ek prasiddh saamaajik vyaktitv he
 Mumbai Police Inspector Arjun Yadav is involved in the investigation of the case related to serial murders
 vah sanjay kaa pataa lagaate hue use uske flats main khoj nikaalte hai or usapar hamalaa kar use apahiz kar dete hai
 Arjun Yadav is surprised to see the extensive set of photographs and written notes
 unhen aisi do diariyaan milteen hai jinamein 2005 or 2006 kii ghatnaon ko kram se lipibaddh kiya gaya he
 The film enters the pre-2005 scene as soon as Inspector Yadav reads the 2005 diary
 sanjay singhania ek pratishthit vyapaaree vansh kaa vyakti he jo air voyas telephone company kaa maalik he
 He has finished his education abroad and returned to take over his family business
 apane kaarobaar ke dauraan sanjay apane karmchaariyon ko ek jujharu abhinetri / model kalpana se milane evam uske apartment ke upar air voyas kaa vishaal vigyaapan board lagane ke bare main baatcheet karne ke liye bhejtaa he
 The owner of Kalpana's modeling / advertising company forgets to think of it as a romance affair and encourages Kalpana to accept the proposal
 vah pramukh model ke rup main uski padonnati kar detaa he
 Kalpana is usually sweet and kind
 vah ise bataur ek maasoom sharaarat karne ke liye sweekaar kar leti he or is prakaar sanjay ke garlfriend ke rup main paheliyon se bharaa naatakeey khel shuru karti he
 Sanjay finally meets Kalpana but he tells him that he is Sachin and is an Adana human who has come from a small town to a big city in search of new life
 kalpana use modling ke chote-mote kaam dilaati he
 Slowly she is drawn towards him in his hypnosis and Sachin also gets swept away in her mildness, simplicity and compassion
 unhen ek duusare se pyaar ho jaataa he or sanjay ko antat usase shaadi kaa prastaav pesh karne kii himmat ho jaati he
 She asks for some time to consider his proposal
 sanjay sthir karata he ki agar vah uske prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he to vah apni asli pahchaan uske saamne ujagar kar degaa; or agar vah asweekaar karti he, to vah chupchaap bina koi haani pahunchaae waapas laut jayega
 The film's story then returns to the present; When Yadav starts reading the 2006 diary
 sanjay achaanak aa jaataa he, yadav par hamalaa kar detaa he or use baandh detaa he
 He discovers Ghazni at a college function where he is the honorable head guest
 sanjay gajani ke kuch chayachitr letaa he or use jaan se maar daalane kaa faisla karata he 
 usee samaaroh main uski mulaaqaat sunita se ho jaati he; vah bhi uske file par lage cover se use pahchaan leti he or usase dosti karne kaa iraadaa karti he
 Later that same evening, Sanjay kills a goon of Ghazni in the parking area
 vah gajani ke aane kaa intjaar karne lagata he lekin ant main usapar phir kabhi kisi or maukey par aakhri hamalaa karne kaa faisla karata he
 The dying injured Gunda reminds Ghazni of an incident that took place two years ago in which Kalpana was murdered and Sanjay became a patient after being hurt
 gajani asamanjas main pad jaataa he or kuch bhi yaad kar paane main naakaam ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Sunita comes to Sanjay's flat and finds Yadav beaten and tied
 use is baat kaa pataa bhi lag jaataa he ki gajani hi sanjay kaa nishaanaa he
 Yadav also informs him that Sanjay is a known serial killer
 sunita ke haathon do diariyaan lag jaatin hai or vah yadav ko aaazaad kar detii he
 Suddenly in the meantime Sanjay reaches there He does not remember any of them and walks out chasing them
 antatogatva yadav ek bas se takaraa jaataa he or sunita badi mushkil se sanakee sanjay se batch nikalati he
 Knowing that Ghajni is in danger, she informs him that it is Sanjay who is behind his life
 is naam ko lakshya banaakar pataa lagaataa hua gajani sanjay ke flats main uski hatya ke iraade se pahunch jaataa he
 He destroys all her photographs and notes and gets her goons overpowered by Sanjay and re-inducts her on her existing tattoo so that all the marks that mark old memories are erased
 All traces connecting with old memories of being restless have been erased, leaving Gajni Sanjay in this condition
 is bich, chatravaas main lautakar sunita 2006 kii diary padhati he
 The film's story then returns to the pre-2006 scene
 aisa dikhaaya jaataa he ki kalpana ne sanjay ke vivaah prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 This diary also ends abruptly
 sunita or aage chaanbin kar pataa lagaati he or yah khoj nikaalati he ki 2006 main kisi padaav par kalpana anjaane main anachaahe hi veshyavriti karwaane waalon ke bure jaal main ulajh gai thi
 During the train journey, he met 25 innocent Bholi Bhali Kamsin girls who were being sent to Mumbai for business
 vah un ladakiyon kii raksha kar unka uddhaar karti he
 But the girls take Ghajni's name as gang gangsters
 gajani apane tareeke se apane madhyamon kaa prayog ladakiyon kii jubaan band karne ke liye karata he or kalpana ko khud khoj nikalne ke liye nikal padataa he
 Ghazni and his goons sabotage into Kalpana's apartment and wait for her to return while Kalpana is found inside
 sanyogvash, sanjay vahaan kalpana se milane pahunch gaya
 Kalpana's last pronounced word was "ghajini"
 The goons attacked Kalpana
 sanjay hastkshep karne hi vaala tha ki achaanak gajani ne lohe kii chad se uske sir par aghat kar diya
 The final scene flashes in front of Sanjay's eyes, that Kalpana was killed by the brutal assault of Ghazni's iron rod
 sunita ko ab sadma vaali sachai kaa pataa chal jaataa he, vah sanjay se mulaaqaat karti he or use bataati he ki sach kya he
 Uncontrollable with anger, he pursues Ghazni zealously
 mumbai main gajani kii maand main pahunchakar sanjay gajani ke sabhi anuchar gurgon ko ek-ek kar baqayada suniyojit dhang se krurtapurvak maar daalata he or gajani ke peeche pil padataa he
 Furiously repulsed, he approaches her and confronts the fight
 vah gajani ko maarna hi chahta he ki uskaa smriti lop chakra phir gum jaataa he or vah vartmaan ko bhul jaataa he
 Ghazni turns and stabs him
 vah sanjay kaa mazaaq udaate hue vibhats ghinauni kahani sunaata he ki usne kaise kalpana kii hatya kii thi, tabhi achaanak apni takat kaa antim ubaal paakar sanjay gajani ko kaabo main kar letaa he
 Sanjay kills Ghazni in the same way that Ghajni murdered Kalpana
 film apni samaapti kii ore badhati he, sanjay abhi bhi apni smriti-lop kii beemaari se grasit ek anathalay main swanyasevak ke rup main kaam kar rahaa he
 Sunita gives him a small gift that marks Sanjay and Kalpana's footsteps on the plaster plate when they entered a new apartment - only to remind him of his intimate companionship with Kalpana
