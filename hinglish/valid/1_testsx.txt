 saanchaa:sociologysamajasaswra main, saamaajik sanghatan ek saidhantik avadharana hoti he jiske antargat ek samaaj yaa saamaajik sanrachana ko ek "kriyasheel sanghatan" ke rup main dekhte hai
 From this point of view, ideally, in order to meet social needs, relations of social characteristics, such as law, family, crime, etc
, are observed during interactions with other characteristics of society
 ek samaaj yaa saamaajik sanghatan ke sabhi avyavon kaa ek nishchit prakaarya hota he jo us sanghatan ke sthayitv or saamanjasy ko banaaye rakhata he
 The model or its concept as a mobilization of society was developed in the late 19th century by Francis sociologist Emile Durkheim
 durkem ke anusaar, ek sanghatan yaa samaaj kaa prakaarya jitna hi vishisht hoga uskaa vikaas bhi utana hi adhik hoga, iskaa thik vipareet bhi satya hoga
 aamtaur par, samskruti, raajnneeti or arthshaastra samaaj kii teen pramukh gatividhiyaan hai
 Social health depends on the systematic interaction of these three activities
 isliye, saamaajik sanghatan ke "swasthya" ko samskruti, raajnneeti or arthshaastra kii parsparik kriya ke prakaarya ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jiskaa ek siddhant ke rup main adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he, pratidarsh banaaya ja saktaa he or vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 The concept of "mobilizing society" was more elaborately described by Herbert Spencer in his essay "the Social Organism"

 But there are other methods by which objects can emit light
 udhaahranswaroop, kuch padaartho par adrishy parabangnee kirnon ke, adrishy cathod kirnon ke, adrishy eks kirnon ke athwa adrishy radioactive vikiran ke padane se ve prakaash utsarjit karne lagate hai
 Light is also released in some chemical reactions
 is sab prabhaavon ko prakashasandipti ke liye praathmik uttejan kai sroton, jaise prakaash, yantric tanaav, rasinic abhikriya, ooshmaa, vidyut urja, nabhikeey vikiran aadi, se praapt ho saktaa he
 Fluorescence emitted by nuclear radiation is caused by the action of excitation and ionization in materials
 padaarth kaa vah gun he jiske kaaran padaarth, anya sroton se nikle vikiran ko avashoshit kar tatkaal hi utsarjit kar detaa he
 Such a substance is called a fluorescent substance from which the emission of light lasts for the same time, or within 10-8 seconds after the stimulant is removed
 10-8 second kaa kaal ek parmaanu kii uttejit avasthaa ke ek sweekaarya athwa anumat sankraman ke jeevankaal ko pradarshit karata he
 Matter is the property of which light is emitted from matter without undetectable heat
 aise padaarth, jinase prakaash kaa utsarjan uttejk vikiran ke samaapt ho jane ke pashchaat hota he, 'sfurdipt padaarth' kehalaate hai
 Fluorescence may persist for different periods in different substances and this period can be from microseconds to several hours
 nabhikeey ganitr ke liye keval laghukalwale sfurdipt padaarth hi upyogi hai
 Names of different types of photoresistance are: electromagnetic fluorescence or gaseous immersion, prakashasandipti, Cathode fluorescence and rasinic prakashasandipti
 Apart from these, there are other forms of photoresistance: prakashasandipti keval gaison main hi nahin, apitu thoson tathaa dravon main bhi ghatit hoti he
 The light emitted by a fluorescent tube is the result of these two types of fluorescent effects: pratideept padaartho ke gyaan ke bahut pehle se sfurdipt padaarthon kaa gyaan logon ko rahaa he
 The reason for this is that fluorescence exposure is not possible without the light of ultraviolet rays, whereas phosphorescence can also be induced by sunlight
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki lagbhag 1000 i
 main ek japani pujari ne oster ke chhilkon ko gandhak ke saath jalaakar ek rang banaaya tathaa us rang se bail kaa ek chitra banaaya tha
 This picture was invisible in daylight, but shone in night light
 europe main sfurdipt padaartho ke prayog kaa prarambh visantius kescariolas ne kiya tha
 He heated the barites with carbon and prepared a material that shone in the dark
 18veen or 19veen shatee ke granthon main sfurdipt padaartho kii charchaa baraabar pai jaati he par keval 19veen shatee ke ant main hi gambhirtha se iskaa adhyayan karne kii ore logon kaa dhyaan gaya
 a special feature of phosphorescence is that the duration of light emission depends on temperature
 yadi sfurdipt padaarth se puti ek pattica ko lekar use parabangnee kirnon ke samaksh rakhaa jaay, taaki baad main kirnon kaa strot hataa lene par vah sfuradipti utpann kare or phir use garam pani main dubaaya jaay to dekha jaayegaa ki prakaash kii tivrata ekadam bad jaati he or uske turant baad hi ksheen hokar samaapt ho jaati he
 But if that plaque is cooled to the temperature of liquid air and placed in front of ultraviolet rays, then after the rays are removed, no phosphorescence will occur, but now if the plaque is removed from the liquid air temperature and it is removed from room temperature But if kept, it will slowly start to extract light
 kintu pratidipti kaa gun isse bilkul bhinn hota he
 It is also present at low temperature
 taap ke badhane se pratidipti kaa kshay hota he
 Some fluorescent substances also decay at temperatures below normal
 kuch pratideept padaartho main saamaanya se neeche taap par bhi kshay hota he
 There are some fluorescent substances, which are 4000 cm
 Fluorescence was also studied by Wood in 1904 and 1912 AD, respectively
 anunadiya pratidipti main utsarjit vikiran kaa tarangadairghy vahi rahata he jo avashoshit vikiran kaa tarangadairghy hota he
 When light is passed through a gas and the rays emitted are seen from the spectroscope and some dark or black lines, called absorption lines, are seen, but very often they are scattered side by side
 in prakirnit kirnon kaa tarangadairghy uttejk kirnon ke tarangadairghy se bhinn hota he
 In 1904, Wood discovered that sodium vapor absorbs only the di-line wavelength of sodium
 or baad main use pun: utsarjit kar detaa he
 In 1912 AD, he did a similar study in relation to mercury
 peeche dunoir ne bhi sodium kaa adhyayan kiya
 This effect is called resonant fluorescence
 prashn yah uthta he ki yadi utsarjit tathaa avashoshit kirnon kaa tarangadairghy samaan nahin he, to phir unamem kya sambandh he ? stokes ne is sambandh main ek niyam pratipaadit kiya jo 'stokes ke niyam' ke naam se gyaat he
 Stokes's law states that the emitted radiation is always of longer wavelength than the excitation radiation
 is prakaar parmaanu dwaara avashoshit urja nishkasit urja kii tulana main sadaa adhik prathit hoti he
 But later study proved that this is not completely true, that is, the expelled energy can be more than the absorbed energy
 aisa ho saktaa he ki uttejit avasthaa main ek parmaanu duusare samaan parmaanuon se takaraakar kuch urja avashoshit kar le
 For this reason, the wavelength of the expelled ray will be less than the wavelength of excitatory radiation
 bahut se pareekshan is baat kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye gaye hai ki prakashasandipti kii tivrata tarangadairghy par kis prakaar nirbhar karti he
 Experiments have shown that photosynthesis is the fastest when excitation occurs by a certain wavelength
 yadi prayukt tarangadairghy adhik yaa kam ho, to tivrata ghat jaati he
 In this case, the excitation spectrum takes the form of a vomiting bell
 yahi baat prakashasandipti ke spectrum kii bhi he
 Generally, the spectrum of light fluorescence is vertically at a certain wavelength
 kabhi kabhi ek se adhik sheersh bhi dekhe gaye hai
 Sometimes the short-wave tail of the fluorescence spectrum covers the longer-wave end of the excitation spectrum
 yah aam niyam nahin he ki pratidipti kii tivrata uttejk tarangadairghy par nirbhar karti he par unke rang par nahin
 The fluorescence emission generated by wavelength 'A' is of shorter wavelength than the wavelength that comes for this reason
 adhik uchit shabdon main stokes ke niyam kaa arth yah he ki utsarjan spectrum kaa gurutvakentre avasorana spectrum kii apeksha adhik tarangadairghy kaa hota he
 In most cases, the two are completely different

 Some of these are crystals of organic compounds, some solutions, crystals of some inorganic materials and powders
 inke atirikt jinon tathaa thos drav evam gas ke rup main kuch anya niskriy gaisen bhi pratideept padaarthon ke rup main upyog main aane lagi hai
 a good fluorescent must have the following properties: high ability to transform incoming energy into visible light; Transparency for its own fluorescent light, a period of micro-seconds or less for fluorescent light, and matching the spectral properties of available photo cathodes from the spectrum of fluorescence
 inke atirikt upyogon ke anusaar rup, aakaar ghantv, dravya kii avasthaa kaa chunaav hota he
 From this point of view we can divide the fluorescent into four classes

 Principles of Organic Crystalline Fluorescent == Fluorescent are aromatic hydrocarbons whose molecules have benzene rings in their structure
 benzene valyon main anya prakaar ke anu bhi vidyaman rah sakate hai
 Since fluorescence of organic crystals is a molecular activity, it can be easily explained by the static energy of the molecule

 This light can be halted or 'extinguished' by the following methods: the transition of energy from the electronically excited state directly to the fundamental state is possible and the analysis level of the molecule a if sufficiently high
 carbon crystal apane pratideept prakaash ke liye praaia: paardarshee hote hai
 It is also worth noting that the expelled energy is higher than the absorbed energy

 The system of generating fluorescence can be best understood on the basis of band theory of solids
 crystal ke vinyas main ek duusare se sudur vyavasthit yanon ke samooh rahete hai
 These bands are formed
 ye anumat tathaa varjit urjaaon ke bane hote hai
 Electrons are filled in their original state
 ise purit band kehete hai
 Above this is a taboo band, which separates the complemented band from the semipermeated band
 ardhapurit band ucchtar urja ke parmanustar ke chaude hone se banataa he
 There is a band above it, which does not have an electron
 ise 'sanvahan band ' kehete hai
 This corresponds to ionization of the atom
 kisi parmaanu kii lakiron kaa chaudaa hona, uske aas paas ke sanyukt vidyut kshetron ke parmaanu ke sanyojaktaa electron par prabhaav ke kaaran hota he
 If atoms at any point in the lattice are inserted into an atom of an inert, such as a copper atom, then the energy will not be wide and go into isolation
 kuch paristhitiyon main bandon ke bich sankeern anumat str utpann ho saktaa he
 Any radiation, such as nuclear radiation, falls on the crystal and transmits electrons from the complemented band to an excited state in the convection band
 jab electron sanvahan band se purit band main lautate hai, to urja mukt kar dete hai
 The electron, which gets excited by reaching into the convection band, now rotates in all the crystals, approaching an imperfection and coming to the energy level of that 'imperfection'
 is nae str se vah waapas varjit band main girakar vikiran mukt kar saktaa he1 yah pratidipti kaa kaaran he
 Instead the electron can lose its energy by an irradiated action, such as thermal energy or lattice oscillation
 1 This action is called extinguishing, because this action prevents the emission of radiation
 ek anya sambhaavna is baat kii bhi ki us apdravya ke parmaanu se sambandhit urjaster par electron fas jaay
 That state is called the transitional state
 electron us samay tak is mitasthayee avasthaa main rahata he jab tak use uthaakar phir sanvahan band main na pahunchaa diya jaay
 From here the electron can dissipate its energy by the actions written above
 yadi misthayee avasthaa main phase rahane ke pashchaat electron purit band main girakar vikiran utsarjit karata he, to us prabhaav ko 'sfuradipti' kehete hai
 By inserting a small amount of appropriate impurities atoms into the crystal, those atoms begin to act as fluorescent centers
 in apdravyon ko 'sakriyakaarak' kehete hai
 Examples of some inorganic antibodies, including their activators: thallium mixed sodium iodide, tin mixed lithium iodide and silver mixed zinc sulfide
 gasiy pratideept padaartho main prakaash gas ke anuon se aata he, jo avashoshit kanon ke swayan se hokar guzarane ke kaaran uttejit tathaa ynikrut ho jate hai
 Excellent gases have been specially studied from this point of view
 northarp or nobles ke vivaranon se pataa lagata he ki is kaam ke liye jinon sabase adhik upyogi maaloom padataa he
 Each excited atom or ion in its original state emits one or more photons within about 10–9 seconds
 is prakaar ek tej prakashaspand utpann ho jaataa he
 This light mainly occurs in the ultraviolet region
 prakaash photon ke prakashailectron main parivartan kii kshamta bahut kam rahati he
 For this reason, several methods are used to increase the efficiency, such as a secondary fluorescent material, tetraphenyl neutadine or quarter phenyl, is applied to the walls of the brackets, so that the wavelength shifts away from the ultraviolet to a wavelength that is photocathode

 They accept each other's theory only
 is siddhant ke anusaar anuon main kwantum yantriki anunaad ke kaaran urja kaa vinimay hota he
 Berks, in contrast, opines that the transfer of energy is done by photons and emphasizes the importance of solvent molecules in fluorescence
 carbonic padaartho ke thos vilyan, jaise polistyrine main tarafenil kaa adhyayan swaank tathaa bak ne kiya he
 They have found 38% of its fluorescence ability of crystalline anthracene

 Black magic is such a bad power or bad energy that has a bad effect on someone
 It is a kind of negative vision and in order to protect from this negative vision, there is a provision for increasing positive energy in Vastushastra
 According to Vastu Shastra, this positive energy art is magic and negative
 The effect of energy works
to increase positive energy, many types of provisions are also indicated in Vastu Shastra
 For example, to remove any type of Vastu Dosha, for example, five basil plants should be planted in the north-east direction on the roof of the house

 The primitive indo-european language, also known as the proto-indo-european language, is considered by linguists to be the only ancient mother tongue of all languages of the entire indo-european language-family
 mana jaataa he ke ise pracheen kaal main aadim-hind-europea log bolaa karte the, lekin yah bhashaa hazaron varsh purv hi puri tarah se lupt ho chuki thi
 Linguists have reconstructed this missing language after comparing homogeneous words of many indo-european languages with which one can infer its words
 bhashavaigyanik anumaan lagaate hai ke aadim-hind-europea bhashaa lagbhag 3700 ipu tak boli jaati rahi or phir uskaa vibhinn bhashaaon main khandan hone laga
 Scholars differ about this date for thousands of years
 is baat par bhi kai avadharanaayen hai ke is bhashaa ko bolne vaale kahan rahete the, lekin bahut se pashchimi vidvan kurgan avadharana main vishwaas rakhte hai
 According to the Kurgan concept, primitive indo-europeans who spoke this language lived in the region of pontic-caspian steppes spread over Eastern Europe and parts of Western Asia
 aadhunik yug main wiliam jones pehle vidvan the jinhone pracheen sanskrit, pracheen unani, pracheen farsi or latin bhashaaon main samantaayein dekhakar yah daawa kiya tha ke ye sari ek hi aadim-hind-europea bhashaa se upji bhashaayen hai
 By the beginning of the twentieth century, the portrayal of the primitive-indo-european language had been done to a great extent by the efforts of linguists, in which minor reforms have been frequent
 chidambaram mandir bhagwaan shiv ko samarpit ek hindu mandir he jo mandiron kii nagari chidambaram ke madhya main, paundicheri se dakshin kii ore 78 kilometre kii duuri par or kuddalor jile ke uttar kii ore 60 kilometre kii duuri par sthit he, kuddalor jila bharat ke dakshinpoorviy rajya tamilnadu kaa purv-madhya bhaag he
 The Sangam classics point to an honorable family of traditional Vishwakarmais of Viduvelvidugu Perumatakan who were the principal architects of the temple reconstruction
 mandir ke itihaas main kai jirnoddhar hue hai, visheshtah pallav / chol shaskaon ke dwaara pracheen evam purv madhyayugin kaal ke dauraan
 In Hindu literature, Chidambaram is one of the five sacred Shiva temples, each of these five sacred shrines representing any of the five natural elements; Chidambaram represents the sky
 is shrenee main aane vaale anya chaar mandir hai: thiruvanaikaval jambukeswara, kanchi ekambareswara, thiruvannamalai arunachaleswara or kalahasti nathar 
 This is the temple building which is situated in the middle of the city and is spread over an area of 40 acres
 yah bhagwaan shiv nataraj or bhagwan govindraj perumal ko samarpit ek pracheen or aitihaasik mandir he, yah un kuch mandiron main se ek he jahaan shaiva va vaishnav donon devtaa ek hi sthaan par pratishthit hai
 For the followers of Shaivism or Shaivism, the word coil means Chidambaram
 Similarly, for those who follow Vaishnavism, it means Srirangam or Thiruvarangam
 shabd chidambaram chit se liya gaya maaloom hota he, jiskaa arth hota he "chetana" or ambaram, kaa arth hota he "akaash" ; yah chidakasam kii ore sanket karata he, chetana kaa akaash, vedon or dharm granthon ke anusaar ise praapt karnaa hi antim uddeshy hona chahie
 Another theory is that it is derived from Chit + Ambalam
 ambalam kaa arth hota he, kala pradarshan ke liye ek "manch"
 chidakasam param anand yaa anand kii ek avasthaa he or bhagwaan natarajar is param anand yaa anand natanam ke pratik maane jate hai
 The Shaivists believe that once they visit Chidambaram, they will be liberated
 ek anya siddhant ke anusaar yah naam chitrambalam se liya gaya he, jisame chithu kaa arth he "bhagavaanon kaa nrity yaa krida" or ambalam kaa arth he "manch"
 a unique feature of this temple is the image of Nataraja with ornaments
 yah bhagwaan shiv ko bharatnatyam nrity ke devtaa ke rup main prastut karti he or yah un kuch mandiron main se ek he jahaan shiv ko pracheen lingam ke sthaan par maanavarupi murti ke rup main pratishthit kiya gaya he
 The cosmic dance of the deity Nataraja symbolizes the movement of the unending continent by Lord Shiva
 mandir main paanch angan hai
 The temple was rebuilt around 1213 A
D
 by Argalur Udai Erar Tevan Ponparappinanam
 inhi ban pramukh ne tiruvannamalai kaa mandir bhi banwaaya tha
 Traditionally the administration of the temple is seen by a Shaivite Brahman community known as Dixitars, married in their own group, who also take over as the temple priests
 yah tamilnadu sarkaar or deekshitar samudaay ke bich lambe samay se chali aa rahi kanoonee ladaai kii paraakaashtha thi
 It started when the government also allowed non-meditated people to sing the Thevaram praise of Lord Shiva in the 'holy Sanctum', to which the Dikshitar community objected and claimed that they had the privilege of worshiping in the sanctum sanctorum of Natraj Is received
 chidambaram kii katha bhagwaan shiv kii thilaai vanam main ghoomane kii puranic katha ke saath prarambh hoti he,, vayushif vrikshon kii ek prajati - jo vartmaan main chidambaram ke nikat pichaavaram ke ardra pradesh main paayi jaati he
 The idols of the temple depict the Thillai trees which belong to the period of the second century CE)
 thilaai ke jangalon main saadhuon yaa 'rishiyon' kaa ek samooh rahata tha jo tilism kii shakti main vishwaas rakhata tha or yah maanata tha ki sanskaron or 'mantron' yaa jaadui shabdon ke dwaara devtaa ko apane vash kiya ja saktaa he
 The Lord travels in the forest with a supernatural beauty and aura, he is presently in the form of a 'pitchatandar', that is, an ordinary monk who begs alms
 unke peeche peeche unki aakarshak akruti or sahachari bhi chalati hai jo mohini rup main bhagwaan vishnu hai
 The sages and their wives are captivated by the beauty and aura of the seductive beggar and his wife
 apni patniyon ko is prakaar mohit dekhakar, rishigan krodhit ho jate hai or jaadui sanskaron ke aahvaan dwaara anekon 'sarpon' ko paidaa kar dete hai
 The wandering god as a beggar picks up the snakes and puts them on his neck, a thankless crest and a girdle in the form of jewelery
 or bhi adhik krodhit ho jane par, rishigan aahvaan kar ke ek bhayanak baagh ko paidaa kar dete hai, jisaki khaal nikaalkar bhagwaan chadar ke rup main apni qamar par baandh lete hai
 When completely discouraged, the sages collect all their spiritual powers and invoke Muyalkan, a powerful demon - a symbol of complete ignorance and pride
 bhagwaan ek sajjanatapurna muskaan ke saath us rakshas kii peeth par chadh jate hai, use hill paane main asamarth kar dete hai or uski peeth par anand tandav karte hue apane vaastavik rup kaa pradarshan karte hai
 Seeing this, the sages realize that this deity is true and is beyond magic and rituals and he surrenders
 bhagwaan shiv kii anand tandav mudra ek atyant prasiddh mudra he jo sansar main anekon logo dwaara pahachaani jaati he 
 yah brahmadia nrity mudra hamen yah bataati he ki ek bharatnatyam nartak / nartki ko kis prakaar nrity karnaa chahie
 These are all the main objects that the Nataraja idol and the cosmic dance pose portray
 melacdambur mandir jo yahaan se lagbhag 32 kilometre kii duuri par he vahaan ek durlabh tandav mudra dekhne ko milti he
 In this Karakoyal, Nataraja and a deity standing around it are depicted dancing on top of a bull, a specimen of the Pala style of Rakhi in the temple
 adhishesh sarp, jo vishnu avatar main bhagwaan kii shaiyya ke rup main hota he, vah anand tandav ke bare main sun letaa he or ise dekhne va iskaa anand praapt karne ke liye adheer hone lagata he
 God blesses him and signals to him that he takes the spiritual form of 'patanjali' and then sends him to Thillai forest with the information that he will perform this dance there in no time
 patanjali jo ki krit kaal main himalay main sadhana kar rahe the, ve ek anya sant vyaghrapathar / pulikaalamuni ke saath chale jate hai
 The story of sage Patanjali and his great disciple Rishi Upamanyu is told in both Vishnu Purana and Shiva Purana
 vah thilaai van main ghoomte hai or shivlinga ke rup main bhagwaan shiv kii puja karte hai, vah bhagwaan jinaki aaj thirumulatneswarar ke rup main puja kii jaati he
 According to mythology, it is believed that Lord Shiva performed the dance of his eternal bliss for these two sages - Nataraja in Tamil month Thai on the day of Pusam Nakshatra
 chidambaram kaa ullekh kai kritiyon main bhi kiya gaya he jaise thilaai, perumpatrpuliur yaa vyaghrapuranan 
 It is believed that the temple is located in the Kamalarupi central region of the universe ": Virat Hridaya Padma Sthalam
 The place where Bhagavan Shiva performed his eternal Ananda dance, Anand Tandava - is the region that is part of the" Thirumoolataneswar Temple " Just to the south, today this region is known as Ponnambalam / Porsabai where Lord Shiva sits in his dancing posture
 isliye bhagwaan bhi sabhanayakar ke naam se jane jate hai, jiskaa arth hota he manch kaa devtaa
 The golden roofed platform is the sacred sanctum sanctorum of the Chidambaram temple and houses the deity in three forms: chidambaram panch booth sthalon main se ek he, jahaan bhagwaan kii puja unke avatar ke rup main hoti he, jaise akaash yaa aagyam 
 Others are: chidambaram un paanch sthalon main se bhi ek he jahaan ke liye yah kaha jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv ne in sthanon par nrity kiya tha or in sabhi sthalon par manch / sabhaayen hai
 Apart from Chidambaram the place where Por Sabhai is, others are Ratina Sabhai in Thiruvalangadu, Chitra Sabhai in Kortallam, Rajat Sabhai or Veli Ambalam in Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple and Thamira Sabhai in Nellaiyappar Temple in Tirunelveli
 sant sundarar apane thiruthonder thogaai kaa prarambh yahi se, thilaai mandir ke pujari kaa sammaan karne ke dwaara karte hai
 To the devotees of the priests of Thillai, i am a devotee
 chaar kavi santon ne is mandir or yahaan ke devtaa ko apni kavitaaon main sadaa ke liye amar kar diya he - thirugnana sambanthar, thirunavukkarsar, sundaramurthi nainer or manikavyasagar
 pratham teenon kii sanyukt kritiyaan praayah devaraam ke naam se jaani jaati hai lekin yah galat he
 Only the songs of Appar are known as Devaram
 sambanthar ke geet thirukadaikappu ke naam se jane jate hai
 The songs of Sundarar are known as Thirupatu
 thirugnana sambanthar ne chidambaram ke bhagwaan kii prashansa main do geeton kii rachana kii thi, thirunavukkarsar urf appar ne nataraj kii prashansa main 8 devaraam kii rachana kii or sundarar ne bhagwaan nataraj kii prashansa main 1 geet kii rachana kii thi
 Manikavyasagar composed two works, the first being Thiruvasakam, the majority of which is recited in Chidambaram and Tiruchitambalakkovaiyar, the full text of which is in Chidambaram
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki manikavyasagar ko chidambaram main aadhyatmik gyaan kii prapti hui thi
 The works of the first three saints were inscribed on palm letters in the temple as manuscripts and were retrieved by the Chola Raza Arunmojahivarman, more popularly known as Sri Rajaraja Chola under the leadership of Nambindranambi
 mandir main kul 9 dwaar hai jiname se 4 par oonche pagoda yaa gopuram bane hue hai prayek gopuram main purv, dakshin, pashchim or uttar kii ore 7 str hai
 The Eastern Pagoda has the entire 108 strings of the Indian dance style - Bharatanatyam
 yah 5 sabhaayen yaa manch yaa haul hai: Apart from the five civilizations, the other places are: mandir ke parisar main anya kai chote dharmik sthal bhi hai
 Moorthy, Sthalam and Theertham symbolize the sanctity of a temple
 chidambaram mandir ke andar or iske aasapaas chaaron taraf anekon jal nikaay uplabdh hai
 There is also a temple of Lord Govindaraj Perumal and his companion Pundarigavalli Thayer in the building of Chidambaram Temple
 yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki yah mandir thilaai thiruchitrakootem he or 108 divyaadeshon main se ek he - yaa bhagwaan vishnu ke pramukh dharmik sthalon main se he, jise bhagwaan vishnu ke pramukh bhakton dwaara gaayi gayi stuti dwaara pavitra kiya gaya he 
 chitrakootem ko kulsekara alvar or tirimangai mannan alvar dwaara gaaya gaya tha
 Both the Alvars have said that Chidambaram Brahman is the Brahman who was worshiping the Vedic and proper God in Chitrakootam
 haalanki is sambandh main kai vivaad hai, kyonki kai log yah maanate hai ki vah chitrakootem jisaki ore alvar logon dwaara sanket kiya ja rahaa he vah uttarapradesh main sthit chitrakoot ho saktaa he jahaan ram ne vishwamitra or atri jaise muniyon ke ashram main samay vyateet kiya tha
 But all such claims are meaningless as a close study of Azhwars Mangalsasanam reveals the religious places which are placed in an order based on geographical location like Mahabalipuram, Thiruvayindrapuram, Chidambaram, Sirgazhi, Tirunangur etc
 On the part of Vaishnava fraternities, it has also been historically claimed that originally this temple was the abode of Lord Sri Govindarajaswamy and Lord Shiva came to contact him with his companions so that he could become the judge of the dance competition between the couple
 Lord Govindarajaswamy agreed to this and the dance competition between the two Shiva and Parvati was on par, during which Lord Shiva went to Sri Govindarajaswamy to find a way to emerge victorious and he indicated that he would raise one of his feet
 Can dance in mahilaon ke liye, natya ashaastra ke anusaar yah mudra varjit thi isiilie jab antat bhagwaan shiv is mudra main aa gaye to parvati ne paraajay sweekaar kar lee or isiilie is sthaan par bhagwaan shiv kii murti nrity mudra main he
 The dance stage or open ground is often called Ambalam
 bhagwaan govindrajaswami is pratispardhaa ke nirnayakarta or sakshi donon hi the
 But later during the cultural invasion of Shaivite religious kings such as Kirumi Kanda Chola etc
 this place was further promoted as a Shaivite religious site
 dheekshitha samudaay ko balpurvak shaiva anuyaayiyon main badal diya gaya 
 The temple's blueprint and architecture is full of philosophical meanings
 chidambaram mandir kaa rath sambhawatah sampurna tamilnadu main kisi mandir ke rath kaa sabase sundar udahaaran he
 This chariot on which Lord Nataraja sits twice a year is drawn by innumerable devotees during festivals
 aagam niyamon ke anusaar ek adarsh shiv mandir main paanch prakaar yaa parikrama sthal honge or uname se prayek ek ke andar ek diwaar ke dwaara vibhajit honge
 Except for internal orbital paths, other external orbital paths will be under the open sky
 sabase andar vaale parikrama path main pradhan devtaa or anya devtaa virajman honge
 There will be a wooden flag or huge stone pillar in the right line of the principal deity
 sabase andar ke parikrama path main pavitra garbh grih sthit hoga
 In this, the Supreme Lord, Shiva will be seated
 ek shiv mandir kii sanrachana ke peeche pratikwaad Chidambaram temple and its symbols sant thirumular, jinaki puranic katha jatil rup se chidambaram se judi hui he, vah apni kriti thirumanthiram main kehete hai 4 angreji ke yah shabd hindi shabdaawalee main likhe jane par nimna bhav vyakt karte hai ki: "meaning:" Shivalinga is a form of human body; Similarly Chidambaram too, likewise Sadasivam and also his sacred dance "
 nataraj swami ke pratik The formless form of Lord Shiva is worshiped in Chidambaram
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki bhagwaan param anand "anand tandav" kii avasthaa main apni sahachari shakti yaa urja jinhen sivgami kehete hai ke saath nirantar nrity kar rahe hai
 a veil covers the space that when inserted, there are frills of golden 'vilv' letters indicating the presence of God
 yah pardaa apane bahari taraf se gahare rang kaa he or andar kii ore se chamkile laal rang kaa he
 During daily rites, the chief priests of that day remove themselves to the state of divinity - shivoham bhava, it is a sign of removal of ignorance and that the place and presence of God begins to appear
 is prakaar chidambara rahasy us kaal kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jab ek vyakti, jo purnatah samarpit ho, bhagwaan ko hastkshep or agyanta ko hataane kii anumati de detaa he, yahaan tak ki tab ham unki upasthiti or anand ko 'dekh kar anubhav' kar pate hai
 The management and administration of the temple is traditionally looked after by Chidambaram Dixitar - it is a class of Vedic Brahmins who, according to mythology, were brought here from Mount Kailash by Saint Patanjali, mainly in the editing of daily rites and the Chidambaram temple
 To oversee
 aisa mana jaataa he ki deekshitar samudaay ke logon kii sankhya 3000 thi or unhen tillai muveyrum kaha jaataa tha
 Today they number 360
 yah deekshitar shivachaariyon yaa adhisiveron ke vipareet vaidic sanskaron kaa paalan karte hai - jo bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana ke liye aagmik sanskaron kaa paalan karte hai
 The rites performed in the temple are synonymous with the Vedas and were prescribed by Patanjali, for whom it is believed that he appointed the people of the Dixitara community to worship Lord Shiva as Nataraja
 aam taur par, dikshitar parivaar kaa prayek vivaahit purush sadsy mandir main sanskaron ko nishpadit karne kaa avasar paata he or vah us din ke pramukh pujari ke rup main bhi kaary kar saktaa he
 Married Dixitars are also entitled to get a share of the income of the temple
 haalanki yah mana jaataa he ki mandir ko lagbhag 5,000 acre upjau bhoomi kaa daan diya gaya he - or mandir anek shaskaon dwaara kai shatabdiyon tak sangrakshan bhi diya gaya he, aaj, iskaa prabandhan lagbhag puri tarah se nijee daan ke dwaara ho rahaa he
 The day begins with the chief priest of the day performing the sacraments of consecrating himself and accepting the Shivaham, after which he enters the temple to perform daily rites
 din kaa armbh subah 7 baje palliyarai se bhagwaan kii charanpaduka ko ek palki main rakhkar pavitra garbh grih main len ke dwaara hota he, is palki ke peeche majira, amlann or mrudang liye hue bhaktagan hote hai
 The priests then begin the daily rites with yagna and 'gau puja'
 puja din main 6 baar kii jaati he
 Before each puja, the sphatika linga - the 'aru Urva' or the half-form of Lord Shiva is anointed with ghee, milk, curd, rice, sandalwood mixture and holy bhashm
 iske baad bhagwaan ko naivedhyam yaa taaje bane khaane or mishthan kaa bhoga lagaaya jaataa he or diparadhana kii jaati he, yah ek rasm hoti he jisame vibhinn prakaar ke sajaavati deepak bhagwaan ko dikhaae jate hai, sanskrit main vedon or panchpuraanon kaa uccharan kiya jaataa he
 The worship ends with the priest removing the curtain of the sanctum sanctorum to reveal the Chidambara mystery
 duusari puja ke purv, niyamit vastuon se sphatik ke ling ke abhishek ke atirikt, ek maanik ke nataraj devtaa par bhi in sab vastuon kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 The third puja takes place around 12 noon in the afternoon after which the temple is closed till 4:30 pm
 chauthi puja shaam ko 6 baje kii jaati he, paanchavi puja rat ko 8 baje kii jaati he or din kii antim puja 10 baje raat main kii jaati he, jiske baad bhagwaan kii charanpaduka ek juluus ke rup main le jaai jaati hai jisase ki vah raatri ke liye 'nivrutt' ho saken
 raat ko paanchavi puja se pehle, pujari chidambara rahasy main, jahaan unhone sugandhit padaarthon dwaara yantra par lepan kiya tha or 'naivedhyam' arpit kiya tha, vahiin par kuch vishesh sanskaron kaa nishpaadan karte hai
 In Chidambaram, the last puja, called Arthajama Puja, is performed with special enthusiasm
 yah mana jaataa he ki jab raat main devtaa nivrutt hote hai to brahmand kii sabhi daivik shaktiyaan unke andar nivrutt ho jaati hai

 The Tamil Nadu government has the authority over the temple under Section 45 of the HR&CE Act 
 haalanki is nirnay ko podu deekshitar samudaay dwaara chunauti di gayi he
 According to the 1951 decision of Madras High Nyayalay, Podu Dixitar community is a religious sect

 The Podhu Dixitar community refused to transfer power to the Managing Officer appointed by the HR&CE Commissioner

 He has also installed modern and elevated pillar lamps at this heritage site
 unka prastaav archana tikat v darshan tikat chaalu chaalu karne kaa he
 Podu Dixitars and devotees have opposed all these actions
 haalanki, sanskaron kii prakriya kaa prabandhan abhi bhi deekshitaron dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 It is said that one full year of human beings is equal to only one day of the gods
 jis prakaar pavitra garbh grih main din main 6 baar puja kii jaati he, usee prakaar pramukh devtaa - bhagwaan nataraj ke liye varsh main 6 baar abhishek kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 Inam Marghjhi Thiruvadhirai as a symbol of the first worship, fourteen days after the new moon of Masi month as a symbol of the second worship, Chittirai Thiruvonam as the emblem of the third puja Aya Uchi Kalam, the archiram of Aandi also known as Aandi Thirumanjnam It is the symbol of Sandhya or the fourth puja, the Chaturdashi of Avni as the symbol of the fifth puja and the Chaturdashi of the Puranasi month, it is called the Arthajama or the sixth worship Is a symbol
 isamen se marghazhi thiruvadhirai or aani thirunanjanam sarvaadhik mahatvapurn hai
 These are celebrated as major festivals in which the main deity is taken out of the sanctum sanctorum as a procession, including a chariot visit to the temple after a long consecration program

 It is mentioned in the Puranas that Saint Pulikalamunivar directed many works of the temple through King Simmavarman
 pallav raajaaon main, simmavarman naam ke teen raja the 
 chunki mandir kavi-sant thirunavukkraasar ke samay main pehle se hi prasiddh tha, isliye is baat kii adhik sambhaavna he ki simmavarman 430-458 ke kaal main tha, arthath simmavarman II
 kottra vankudi main tamra patron par kii gai pattayam yaa ghoshnaaen is baat ko siddh karte hai
 However, Thandanathotta Pattayam and other Pattayams of the Pallava period further indicate that Simmavarman had a connection with the Chidambaram temple
 atah yah mana jaataa he ki simmavarman pallav rajvansh ke rajkumaar the jinhone rajasi adhikaron kaa tyaag kar diya tha or aakar chidambaram main rahane lage the
 Since it is found that Pulikal Munivar and Simmavarman were contemporaries, it is believed that the temple was built during this period
 haalanki, yah tathy ki sant-kavi manikavyasagar chidambaram main rahe or alokik gyaan ko paaya kintu unka kaal sant-kavi thirunavukkraasar ke bahut pehle kaa he or jaisaa ki bhagwaan nataraj or unki vishisht mudra or prastuti kii tulana pallav vansh ke anya kaaryon se nahin kii ja sakati kyonki yah bahut shreshth he, isliye yah sambhav he ki mandir kaa astitv simmavarman ke samay se ho or baad ke kaal main bhi koi pulikaalamuniver naam ke sant hue hon
 Large-scale repair and renovation works are carried out at periodic intervals, new facilities are added and distinguished

 Although this process helped the existence of temples as places of worship, in a complete archeological or historical point of view, these navigators destroyed the original actual works of the Amandir without intention - which was the later grand temple plans
 Did not equate with chidambaram mandir bhi is aam chalan kaa apwaad nahin he
 The origin and development of the temple is therefore largely extracted from the context of literary and poetic works, with oral information being passed down from generation to generation by the Dixitar community and now through the very few manuscripts and inscriptions remaining
 sangam sahitya ke madhyam se ham yah jaanate hai ki ki chol vansh ke shaasha is pracheen dharmik sthal ke mahaan bhakt the
 It is said of the Chola king Kochengannan that he was born after kings Subhadevan and Kamaladevi, who are worshiped in the Thillai Golden Hall
 atah is baat ki sambhaavna he ki swarna haul sahit yah mandir aaj se hajaaron varsh purv se astitv main he
 The architecture of the temple - especially the architecture of the sanctum sanctorum, does not even match the architecture of any other temple of the Chola dynasty, Pandey dynasty or Pallava dynasty
 ek seemaa tak, mandir ke is rup main kuch nishchit samanthaayen he jo chera vansh ke mandir ke roopon se mail karti hai lekin chera rajvansh kaa sabase pracheen sandarbh jo uplabdh he vah kavi-sant sundarar ke kaal kaa he
 Unfortunately the available evidence of the Chidambaram temple or its related work dates back to the 10th century and beyond
 chidambaram mandir se sambandhit kai shilaalekh aasapaas ke kshetron main or swayan mandir main bhi uplabdh hai
 Most of the available inscriptions belong to the following periods: dakshin gopuram raja pandya dwaara nirmit tha
 The proof of this is found by the fish emblem of the Pandya dynasty, which has been carved out of roof
 aitihaasik drushti se, yah man jaataa he ki gopiram kaa nirmaan purna hone par pandya rajvansh ne vahaan par ek duusare kii or sammukh do machhliyon ko gadhwaya tha

 It seems that after this Gopuram was rebuilt by Pallava king Koperunsingen i 1216-1242 CE, after completing the first level
 Gopuram is called Sokkasiyan Thirunilai Ezhugopuram
 pashchimi gopuram jadavavarman sundar pandyan i 1251-1268 dwaara banwaaya gaya tha
 North Gopuram was built by King Krishnadevarayaar of Vijayanagar 1509-1529 CE
 poorviy gopuram sabase pehle pallav raja coperunsingan II 1243-1279 dwaara banwaaya gaya tha

 rajraja chol kii beti kundaavai II bhi mandir ko swarna or dhan sampatti daan karne ke liye jaani jaati hai
 Later the Chola king Vikram Chola also gave considerable donations to the temple for performing daily rites

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d

 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race

 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians

 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia

 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture

 din-i-ilahi was a homogenous religion by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1582 AD, which inserted the core elements of all religions, prominently Hindu and Islam religions
 inke alaava parsi, jain evam isai dharm ke mul vichaaron ko bhi sammalit kiya
 However, he did not do much to promote this religion, only you included the trusted people in it
 kaha jaataa hai ki akbar ke alaava keval raja birbal hi mrityu tak is ke anuyaayi the
 According to dabestan-e-mazhab, after Akbar, only 19 people adopted the s Dharma
 Later on, Akbar composed a new almanac in which he started a theocratic era which began from the day of Akbar's coronation
 usne tatkaaleen sikkon ke peeche allahu-akbar likhvaya jo anekaarthi shabd tha
 Akbar literally means "great" and the word allahu-akbar could have two meanings "allah is great" or "akbar is Allah"
 deen-i-ilaahi sahi myanon main dharm na hokar ek aachaar sahinta samaan tha
 Indulgence, pride, condemnation or blaming were forbidden and were called sins
 dayaa, vichaarsheelataa or sanyam iske aadhaar stambh the
 Akbar reached the famous pilgrimage, Kurukshetra
 vahaan suryagrahan par aaj bhi bada mela hota he
 People take bath us samay, kuch sadhu-vairaagi bhi kurukshetra ke kunda main snaan karne aae the, parantu unamem yah vivaad tha ki koun dal pehle snaan kare
 Even today, there is a fight over taking bath first
 atev jab yah vivaad tay na ho sakaa to donon dalon ne badshaah se fariyaad kii
 Both had their claims, but the king could not get any definite proof
 jaan padataa he, yuvak akbar ko kuch masakhri suujhi
 He said- Let the two fight among themselves, the party that wins will take a bath first
 is par ek dal ne fariyaad kii ki vipakshiyon ke dal main adhik vyakti hai
 Humorous Akbar said that it is okay, who has less men, he should take as many royal soldiers
 phir kya tha, kisi ne kisi kii dadhi pakadi, kisi ne kisi kii jataa
 a very funny depiction of this pride was found in the royal copy of akbar-naam
 akbar ke saath gaye chitrakaaron ne ghatana kaa chitra banaaya he
 Looking at the picture, it is known that Akbar, who was standing at a distance, was also enjoying this spectacle
 akbar ke darbar main jain bhi the, yah badayunni or abul fazal donon hi kehete hai
 Two prominent Jain sages Heer Vijayaji and his disciple Vijayasen Suri came to his court
 ye donon shwebantar jain the
 Among them, Heer Vijayji Suri received the order of Akbar in 1584 AD
 log jainon ke sammukh hinsa na karen or maance na khaaen
 Akbar must have had great reverence for Heer Vijayji
 abul fazal ne likhaa he ki ve ucchtam koti ke dharmik vyakti the
 Due to their influence, Akbar was disgusted with the violence of the creatures and on several specific dates he refused the violence of the creatures in his empire
 vah swayan maance-bhakshan ke viruddh ho gaya
 He himself took a fast to eat vegetarian food every Friday
 akbar ne yah mahasoos kiya ki sabhi dharmon kaa ek hi uddeshy he
 Therefore, he took the path of coordinating all religions i
e
 taking good things from all religions
 isi ko usne 'sulah kul' kaha
 In this way, he started din-i-ilahi with the good things of all religions
 isamen islam kaa akeshwarwadatha, to parsi dharm ke anusaar surya or agni us ishwar ke prakaash or tej ke rup main poojaneey the
 Non-violence of Hindu and Jain religions had a deep imprint on this religion
 yah tark diya gaya he ki deen-e-ilaihi kaa ek nayaa dharm hone kaa siddhant galat dharna he, jo ki baad main british itihaaskaaron dwaara abul fazal ke kaaryon ke galat anuwaad ke kaaran paidaa hua tha
 However, it is also accepted that the policy of sulah-i-kul, which had the essence of din-i-ilahi, was adopted by Akbar not just for religious purposes but as a part of the general imperial administrative policy
 isane akbar kii dharmik sahanubhuti kii niti kaa aadhaar banaaya
 At the time of Akbar's death in 1605 there was no sign of dissatisfaction among his Muslim subjects, and a theologian like Abdul Haq had the impression that close relations remained
 samraat hone ke naate akbar dharmik tatwon kii tah main janaa apana kartavya samajhataa
 Once he sat on the rock in the morning in solitude in Fatehpur Sikri, there was a feeling in his mind that he should not discriminate among his subjects
 duusari ore islam ke mullah gaiyr-musalamaanon ko sataane kii salaah dete
 Their debates started becoming so fierce that even in front of the emperor, they did not pay attention to the courtier
 is sabase akbar ke man main sachai kii khoj kii pravriti or adhik badi
 In akbar-nama, Abul Fazl writes that after this the court was filled with scholars of all religions and sects
 sabhi kii dharmik manyataon par vichaar hota
 If there was any weakness in them, it would be revealed
 dharmik sahishnutaa barti jaati, isse ulti buddhi vaale or dushton ko jalan hoti
 When Akbar was freed from internal strife, he turned his attention to religious reform
 usne ek nae dharm kii sthapana kii
 In this he coordinated the Holy Quran, theology of Brahmins and the teachings of Jesus Christ
 is hetu usne ek sabha kii
 In this he called the Acharyas of all religions, as well as his mansabdars
 tha It is worth noting that fundamentalist followers of all religions opposed Akbar's liberal approach
 is par akbar ne kaha- 'kisi bhi samrajya ke antargat yah anuchit he ki janata anek dharmon main vibhajit ho
 This creates differences among themselves
 jitne dharm utane hi dal hai
 There is enmity between them and hence coordination is required in all religions
 parantu ise aise dhang se karnaa chahie ki ek hote hue bhi unki visheshta bani rahe
 With this, the goodness of all religions will remain and the characteristics of other religions will also come
 isse ishwar k prati aadar badhegaa, logon main shanti hogi or samrajya kii suraksha bhi badhegi
 ' yorapia yatriyon kaa kathan he ki akbar kii ankhen is prakaar dapati rahati maano sagar par surya jhilamila rahaa ho
 His voice was loud, he had a resonance
 koi bhi use dekhtaa to jaan jaataa ki yahi badshaah he
 Jahangir says that people found the glory of God in him
 vah attahas karata tha or us samay uskaa cheharaa hansee ke maare thodaa vikrut ho jaataa
 He rarely used to get angry
 vah atyant dheer tha
 European travelers were surprised that his mind would not appear with facial expressions, but his figure became unbearable in anger
 uske munch ke bal khadey ho jate
 Incidentally, Akbar went to Mathura to play hunting
 vahaan use gyaat hua ki mathura aane par hinduon ko kar dena padataa he
 He lifted the passenger tax
 akbar ne kaha- yah kahan kaa nyaay he ki ishwar kii aradhana par kar liya jaae! agle hi varsh, apane rajbhishek kii nauveen varshaganth par usne muslim kanoon ke anusaar gaiyr-muslimon par lagane vaale kar- jajia ko bhi uthaa liya
 This was a unique event
 phir to donon pidiyon tak jajia kar nahin laga- aurangzeb ne 1679 main jaswantsingh kii mrityu ke baad jajia kar punah lagaaya
 Jajia would earn lakhs of rupees annually to the empire
 phir bhi akbar ne ise anuchit mana

 He is recognized as the originator of the psychoanalytic tradition in the history of Hindi novels
 janendra apane paatro kii saamanyagati main sookshm sanketon kii nihithi kii khoj karke unhen bade kaushal se prastut karte hai
 The character characteristics of his characters emerge from the joint for this reason
 janendra ke upanyaason main ghatnaon kii sanghatnatmakataa par bahut kam bal diya gaya miltaa he
 The directive formulas for the reactionary possibilities of the characters are derived from the shelter of psychology and philosophy

 His childhood name was Anandilal
 inaki mukhya dein upanyaas tathaa kahani he
 He is also recognized as a literary thinker
 inke janm ke do varsh pashchaat inke pita kii mrityu ho gai
 His mother and maternal uncle raised him
 inke mamaa ne hastinapur main ek gurukul kii sthapana kii thi
 At the same time, Janendra got his initial education
 unka namakaran bhi isi sanstha main hua
 His household name was Anandi Lal
 san 1912 main unhone gurukul chhod diya
 He came to Bijnor to prepare to appear for the matriculation examination in private
 1919 main unhone yah pariksha bijanour se na dekar punjab se uteern kii
 Jainendra did his higher education at Kashi Hindu University
 1921 main unhone vishvavidhyalay kii padhai chhod di or congress ke asahyog andolan main bhaag lene ke uddeshy se dilli aa gaye
 He also stayed in Lala Lajpat Rai's 'tilak School of Politics' for some time, but eventually left him
 san 1921 se 23 ke bich janendra ne apni mata kii sahaayta se vyapaar kiya, jisamen inhen safalataa bhi mili
 But in 23 he moved to Nagpur and started working as a correspondent in political papers there
 usee varsh inhen giraftaar kar liya gaya or teen maah ke baad chhot gaye
 On returning to Delhi, he separated himself from the business

 Zainendra was a unique explorer of his path
 unhone premachand ke saamaajik yatharth ke maarg ko nahin apanaaya, jo apane samay kaa rajmarg tha
 But he was not the antonym of Premchand, as many critics have proved; He was a complement to Premchand
 premachand or jainendra ko saath-saath rakhkar hi jivan or itihaas ko uski samagrata ke saath samajha ja saktaa he
 Jainendra's greatest contribution was in the creation of Hindi prose
 bhashaa ke str par jainendra dwaara kii gai tod-phod ne hindi ko taraashne kaa abhootpurv kaam kiya
 The prose of the unknowable would not have been possible if Jainendra's prose were not there
 hindi kahani ne prayogshiltaa kaa pehla paath jainendra se hi siikhaa
 Zainendra gave Hindi a transparent language and break, gave a new tone, a new `syntax '
 aaj ke hindi gadhy par jainendra kii amit chhap he
 - Ravindra Kalia has come out of the inclusion of philosophical and metaphysical elements in almost all the novels of Zainendra, but wherever these elements are included in the novels, they seem to create a difference of characters
 yahi kaaran he ki janendra ke paatr bahya vaataavaran or paristhitiyon se aprabhavit lagate hai or apni antarmukhi gatiyon se sanchalit
 Their reactions and behavior are also often in line with these motions
 isi kaa ek parinaam yah bhi hua he ki janendra ke upanyaason main charitron kii bharmaar nahin dikhaai detii
 The lack of characters has also led to the prominence of individual elements in Zainendra's novels
 krantikarita tathaa aatankvadita ke tatv bhi janendra ke upanyaason ke mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 The leading male characters in all his novels believe in a strong revolution
 bahya swabhaav, ruchi or vyavhaar main ek prakaar kii komalta or bhirutha kii bhaavana liye hokar bhi ye apane antar main mahaan vidhvansak hote hai
 This subversive personality of hers is created as a result of her reaction to the romantic disapproval of the woman
 isi kaaran jab ve kisi nari kaa thodaa bhi aashray, sahanubhuti yaa prem pate hai, tab tuutakar gir padate hai or tabhi unka bahya swabhaav komal ban jaataa he
 Janendra's female characters are often prominent in the novel
 upanyaaskaar ne apane nari paatro ke charitra-chithran main sookshm manovaigyanik drushti kaa parichay diya he
 Jainendra has been able to credibly mark the diverse forms of women, her abilities and reactions
 'sunita', 'tyaagptr' tathaa 'sukhada' aadi upanyaason main aise anek avasar aae hai, jab unke nari charitra bheeshan maansik sangharsh kii sthiti se guzare hai
 The feeling of incompleteness and interdependence of woman and man is the basic basis of this struggle
 vah apane prati purush ke aakarshan ko samajhati he, samarpan ke liye prastut rahati he or poorak bhaavana kii is kshamta se aalhadit hoti he, parantu kabhi-kabhi jab vah purush main is aakarshan moh kaa abhaav dekhati he, tab kshubdh hoti he, vyathit hoti he
 In the same way, when it comes to expectation of harshness from a man, it also becomes unbearable
 srilanka main hindi bhashaa ko bahut pasand kiya jaataa he
 However, Hindi is compulsorily taught in only five schools here
 yahan hindi paathyakram or pariksha kii zimmedaari kendriya hindi santhaan sambhalata he
 Every year around 600 students appear in the exam here
 kendriya hindi santhaan ke vibhaagadhyaksh mira sareen kaa kahana he ki hindi inke liye keval rojgaar kaa jariya nahin he, yah kaarobaar ko bhi nai oonchaai main le jane kaa saadhan he
 There is a craze for Hindi among Sri Lankan students with a great sense of respect
 bharat dwaara srilanka main hindi ke santhaan sthapit karne ke baad pakistan ne bhi urdu bhashaa ke liye yahan santhaan shuru kiya
 Jyoti Parmar said on this that many Urdu words are used in Hindi songs
 is kaaran urdu seekhney kaa laabh bhi miltaa he
 But Hindi is mainly used in Hindi films and songs and Hindi language also contains Urdu words
 is tarah urdu keval ek tarah se gaanon ko or hindi ko samajhane main sahaayak hi he
