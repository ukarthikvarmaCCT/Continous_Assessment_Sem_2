 This Shiva Shastotra is very dear to Lord Shiva, filled with immense love by the devotee Shri Gandharvaraj Pushpadanta

 Everyone means Shiva only if both Shiva and Vishnu are together, then it is called Harihar
 is pankti kaa arth he ki har prakaar ke paapon ko saman karne vaala yah stotra bhagwaan shiv ko atipriy he
 This stotra is a true Shiva form and is very popular among Shiva devotees
 mukhyalekh: gandharvaraj pushpadanth There is a very interesting story on the construction of this hymn
 ek samay kii baat he jab chitrarath naamak shivbhakt raja hue jinhone apane rajya main kai prakaar ke pushpon kaa ek udyaan banwaaya, vah shivapujan ke liye pushp vahiin se le jate the
 The great Shiva devotee Gandharva Pushpadanta Devaraj was the lead singer of Indra's assembly, one day he looked at that beautiful garden and was enchanted, he broke the flowers and departed from the same garden

 The king got an idea, he laid flowers on Shiva, etc
 on the path of the garden
 agle din jab pushpadanth vahaan aae to unki najar un shiv nirmalya vastuon par nahin padi jisase unke pad hi unpar pad gaye
 Gandharvaraja had to bear the wrath of Shiva and all his powers came to an end

 In this way the Shiv Mahimna Stotra was composed

 Esperanto is an easy and artificial international language
 "doctoro asperanto" ke upnaam se is bhashaa ke nirmaataa ludwig laazar zamenhof ne asperanto kii pehali kitaab 1887 main warsaw main prakashit kii thi
 He wanted Esperanto to be a universal language
 is bhashaa main "asperanto" shabd kaa arth he "aashaa rakhane vaala"
 This language was created with the help of the major languages of Europe
 isaki lipi bhi dhwani siddhanton par aadhaarit he
 The script is pronounced as it is read
 alag-alag matra bhashaayen bolne waalon ke liye asperanto ek samuhik, yojit, saral bhashaa he
 Zamenhof's aim was to have a language that is easy to learn, politically neutral, transcending nationality, and a tool for peace and international communication between speakers of different provincial and national languages
 kaha jaataa he ki aaj duniya main 1 lakh se 20 lakh ke bich log asperanto bol sakate hai
 The largest number of speakers of this language are in Europe, East Asia and South America
 pehla vishwa asperanto sammelan 1905 main france main yojit kiya gaya tha
 After that, world conventions are taking place in different countries every year, except for the two great wars
 asperanto anya bhashaaen seekhney ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 For many years the question of international language has been attracting the attention of politicians, scientists and philologists
 vaigyanik naap-taul ke liye duniya bhar main ek se antarrashtriya shabd vyavhaar main laae ja rahe hai
 Definitions of international behavior are being coined and recognized in large numbers
 bhashaa shastri is vishay par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahe hai ki thode se vyakaran ke sarvasweekrut niyam bana lene se ek antarrashtriya bhashaa taiyaar ho jaaegi
 In 1887 AD, Dr
 L
 L
 Zamenhof composed Esperanto
 avishkarta ke anusaar asperanto main antarrashtriya bhashaa banane kii sab visheshtaayen maujuud hai
 His phrase is based on logic and scientific rules
 uske vyakaran ko aadhe ghante main samajha ja saktaa he
 Every rule is exceptional
 shabdon ke hijje kaa aadhaar dhvanyatmak he
 His dictionary is very short
 phir bhi usamen saahitiyik shakti he, shailisaundarya he or vichaaron ko vyakt karne main vah kaante kii taul utarati he
 There is also a considerable amount of flexibility in it
 20 varsh purv ke aankadon ke anusaar asperanto bhashaa main us samay tak 4,000 se adhik moulik or anudit pustake prakashit ho chuki thim or 100 se adhik masik patr niyamit rup se prakashit hote the
 Before the Second World War, students were taught in Esperanto schools as a language in many countries of the world
 paris ke chember ov kamrs or landan kii county concil camershal vidyalayon main asperanto kii shiksha di jaati thi
 In 1925 AD, the International Telegraphic Union accepted Esperanto as the international language of telegram
 may, san 1927 main antarrashtriya radiophonic union se use prasar ke yogya bhashaa ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 By December of the same year, 44 AIR stations spread across Esperanto in various countries
 20 vaarshik antarrashtriya asperanto sammelan main akhil vishwa se 1,000 se lekar 4,000 pratinidhi tak sammilit hue the
 In the year 1887, the form of Esperanto was changed in 1907 AD to make it more simple and scientific
 asperanto ke is nae rup kaa naam ido rakhaa gaya
 There are many more languages in the field today competing with Esperanto as an international language
 filhal asperanto seekhney ke 'auzaar' hindi main uplabdh nahin hai
 Hindi speakers can learn Esperanto through another language - English and other foreign languages can also be learned on Esperanto Internet
 ek nazar in pannon par daaliye: or 
 1) International: Esperanto is most useful when people who speak different mother tongues meet
 aaj duniya bhar main asperanto bolne waalon kii sankhya lakhon main he
 2) Equality: When you speak Esperanto, you feel like everyone else, because those you are speaking to have tried to learn Esperanto just like you
 3) tatasth: asperanto kisi ek jati yaa desh kii amaanat nahin he
 Therefore it functions as a neutral language
 4) saralata: asperanto is tarah taiyaar kii gayi he ki yah bhashaa siikhnaa baaki bhashaaon kii tulana main bahut aasaan he
 a comment on grammar: 5) jivant bhashaa: anya bhashaaon kii tarah hi asperanto kaa bhi vikaas hota aayaa he or is zabaan main hamaare sabhi vichaaron or jazabaaton ko vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 There are many examples of Esperanto literature on the Internet and two words about Esperanto culture
 asperanto main kai bhashaaon se shabd liye gayi hai
 Esperanto's alphabet has 28 letters
 kuch aksharon par topi lagaate hai
 The Esperanto language does not contain the letters Q, W, X, Y
 harek akshar kaa uccharan nishchit he
 
 is kaaran asperanto main anya europee bhashaaon jaisaa ssailing kaa jhanjhat nahin he
 This language is written as it is spoken
 udhaaharan ke liye, Mi lernas Esperanton kaa uccharan me lernas asperanton he
 It means "I learn Esperanto" or "I am learning Esperanto"
 Esperanto estas pli facila ol la angla is pronounced Esperanto estas ply fascila ol la angla
 iskaa arth he, "asperanto angreji se aasaan he
 " nawapaara chha, sanrgarh mandal main bharat ke chhattisgarh rajya ke antargat raigarh jile kaa ek gaanv he

 unani varnmaala choubees aksharon kii varna vyavastha he jinke prayog se unani bhashaa ko aathvin sadi isa-purv se likhaa ja rahaa he
 This is the first and oldest alphabet with a separate symbol for each vowel and consonant
 yah varnmaala phonishian varnmaala se utpann hui thi or europe kii kai varna-vyavasthaayen isi se janmi hai
 The Roman script used to write English and the Cyrillic alphabet used to write the Russian language are both born of the Greek script
 duusari shatabdi isapurv ke baad ganitagyon ne unani aksharon ko ank darshane ke liye bhi prayog karnaa shuru kar diya
 Greek characters are used in many fields of science, such as names of elements in physics, names of stars, names of fraternities and fellow communities, names of warm cyclonic cyclones

 Linear b originated from Linear A, developed by the Minoan civilization whose language was not related to Greek, as a result the Minoie alphabets do not provide an ideal medium for transliteration of Greek sounds

 Its most notable change, as an adaptation of the phonetic Phoenician alphabet, is the inclusion of vowel letters, without which Greek would have been unreadable
 semitic varnmaala main swar chinh multah prayog nahin kiye gaye
 In the preceding Western Semitic script family, a letter was always used for consonants with a nonspecific vowel
 isane pathneeyata ko kam nahin kiya kyonki simitic bhashaaon main shabd triakshari jadon par aadhaarit he jo ki keval vyanjan kii upasthiti maatr se arth spasht karata he evam sandarbh dwaara swar spasht hote hai
 In contrast, Greek is an indo-european language, so the difference in vowel produces a large difference in meaning
 atev, unani varnmaala ne aksharon ko do shreniyon - swar evam vyanjan main vibhakt kar diya, jahaan ek vyanjan ko ek uccharan yogya ikai banane ke liye swar ke saath prayog karnaa aavashyak he

 Explained by the innovation of ω '
 anya swaron main deergh evam hrisv ke madhya graphic antar kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 For lexical materials, this would normally be a sufficient feature, but whenever long vowels η and ω come out of the verbal system - and they are ubiquitous like α, ι and υ - they have to be considered graphically
 Two other long vowels derive pictorial distinctions - long closed e and long closed u - both are understood by the picture

 Each phonetic letter name was a word that began with the sound of that letter; Hence the word ʾaleph for "ox" was adopted for the glottal barrier / ʔ / , bet, or "house", / b / for sound and many more
 When the letters were adopted by the Greeks, most of the phonetic names were retained / mildly adapted to the Greek phonology; So ʾaleph, bet, gimel alpha, beta, gamma became

 Zoology or zoology is the branch of biology which deals with animals and their life, body, development and classification
 praani kii paribhaasha kai prakaar se kii gai he
 Some people call an animal such that it does not produce carbohydrates, proteins and fats, but depends on them for living
 in padaarthon ko praani bahya strot se hi praapt karata he
 The plants that make them are organisms of plants, which create them from substances derived from inorganic sources
 ye donon hi paribhaashaayen sab praaniyon par lagu nahin hotin
 There are some fungi and bacteria of plant species, which get their food from external sources
 kuch aise praani bhi hai, jo starch kaa srijan swayan karte hai
 Therefore, it becomes difficult in some cases to differentiate between animals and plants
 yahi kaaran he ki pranivigyaan or padpavigyaan kaa adhyayan ek samay vigyaan kii ek hi shakha main saath saath kiya jaataa tha or uskaa naam jaiviki yaa jeev vigyaan diya gaya he
 But today these two branches have become so developed that it is not possible to study them together
 at: aajkal pranivigyaan evam padpavigyaan kaa adhyayan alag alag hi kiya jaataa he
 The study of zoology is of great importance to humans
 manushyake chaaron ore alag-alag prakaar ke jantu rahete hai
 He sees them and he gets equal work from them
 kuch jantu manushya ke liye bade upyogi siddh hue hai

 kuch jantu manushya ke sabhi hai or ye manushya ko ksht pahunchaate, fasal nasht karte, pidaa dete or kabhi kabhi maar bhi daalate hai
 Therefore, the study of zoology is important for us
 bauddhik vikaas ke kaaran manushya anya praaniyon se bhinn hota he, par shaareerik banaavat or shaareerik pranali main anya kuch praaniyon se badi samanta rakhata he
 The senses and functioning of some of these creatures are very similar to the senses and functioning of humans
 isse anek nai oshadhiyon ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan karne main in praaniyon se laabh uthaaya gaya he or anek nai nai oshadhiyon ke avishkaar main sahaayta mili he
 The study of beings has been going on since very ancient times
 iskaa pramaan ve pracheen guphaayen hai jinaki pathar kii deevaaron par pashuon kii akritiyaan aaj bhi pai jaati hai
 The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote a book on animals 300 years before Christ
 gailena ek duusare roman vaidya the, jinhone duusari shatabdi main pashuon kii anek visheshtaon kaa badi spashtataa se varnan kiya he
 Many other writers in Greece and Rome have written books on natural science, which mention animals
 baad main lagbhag hajaar varsh tak pranivigyaan bhula diya gaya tha
 In the 16th century, the attention of this science was again attracted
 us samay chikitsa vidyalayon ke adhyapakon kaa dhyaan is ore vishesh rup se gaya or ve iske adhyayan main pravrutt hue
 Special progress of this science took place in the 17th and 18th centuries
 sookshmdarshi ke avishkaar ke baad iskaa adhyayan bahut vyapak ho gaya
 Modern zoology often laid its foundation at this time and special attention was paid to the naming and morphology of animals

 By that time, the number of known animals had become very large and their classification became necessary

 It has become necessary to divide it into several branches for proper study

 The song Golagovinda describes the raslila, Radhavishad narration with Krishna's gopikas, distraction for Krishna, uplambha vow, utterance for Radha of Krishna, Radha's viraha by Radha's Sakhi

 Therefore, Dr
 A
B
 Keith in his 'history of Sanskrit Literature' has considered it as 'unequaled poetry'
 san 1784 main wiliam jones dwaara likhit ‘on da musical mods of da hindooj’ pustak main gitgovind ko 'pastoral drama' arthath ‘gopanaty’ ke rup main mana gaya he
 Then in 1837, the French scholar Edwin Arnold Tarson called it 'lyrical drama' or 'geetinatya'
 vaan shroder ne ‘yatra prabandh’ tathaa pishaal levi ne ‘melo drama’, incyclopedia britanika main gitgovind ko ‘dharmanataka’ kaha gaya he
 Similarly, many scholars have expressed their views regarding it in their own way
 german kavi gete mahoday ne abhigyanshakuntalam or meghdutam ke samaan hi gitgovind kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii he
 In the Geetgovind poetry, Jayadev mentions Jagdish as Jagannath, Dashavatari, Hari, Murari, Madhuripu, Keshav, Madhav, Krishna, etc
 yah 24 prabandh tathaa 72 shlokon yukt paripurna granth he jisamen radha-krishna ke milan-virah tathaa punarmilan ko komal tathaa laalityapurna padon dwaara bandha gaya he
 But the 13th canto of Geetgovind is also available in the 'handwritten Sanskrit Text List, part-i' published by Nagari Pracharini Sabha
 parantu yah maatrakaa arvachin prathit hoti he
 Geetgovind is highly revered in the Vaishnava sect
 atah 13veen shatabdi ke madhya se hi shri jagannatha mandir main ise nity seva ke rup main angikaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In every arrangement of this lyrical sense, the poet has also introduced its religious and philosophical poetry by using the words pleasant, famous, virtuous, salvation, etc
 shringaar ras varnan main jayadev kalidas kii parampara main aate hai
 The description of Geetgovind is comparable to the description of Srimad Bhagwat; And in the Akrur eulogy in Srimad 10, chapter 40 of Srimad Bhagwat, which describes Dashavatara, it corresponds to the praise description of the first canto of Geetgovind
 aage chalakar gitgovind ke anek ‘anukriti’ kavy rache gayi
 Therefore Jayadeva himself wrote in the 12th canto - kumbhkarna pranit ‘rasikapriya’ tikaa aadi main isaki pushti kii gayi he
 Due to the popularity and beauty of Geetgovind, it has been translated into prose and verse in every language of India and in English, Latin, French, German, Arabic, Persian etc
 languages
 iske alaava sanskrit bhashaa main iske jo anuwaad, bhashya, tikaa or tippanee likhe gayi hai, vaisaa kisi anya bhashaa main milanaa asambhav he
 Some commentators have described it as a beautiful poetry, while some have given importance to the Bhakti community and considered it as devotional poetry; So, by giving priority to music, it has given it the form of music and some commentators have interpreted the word etymologically with respect to the melody and beauty
 isliye nihsandeh gitgovind ek sarvatantra swatantra granth he
 Udayanacharya, the first commentator of Geetgovind, has written 'bhavavibhavini' commentary
 jagannatha puri ke atyant nikat praachi ke kinare rahanevaale udaynacharya jadyadev ke priy mitra tathaa prashansak the
 Between 1170 and 1198, 'bhavavibhavini' commentary was written, which contains 100 verses
 isaki teen maatrikas udaipur or nagpur main uplabdh hai
 There are twelve cantos in the 'geetgovind' poetry, which is divided into twenty-four arrangements
 in prabandhon kaa upavibhaajan padon athwa geeton main hua he
 Each verse or song has eight verses
 geeton ke vaktaa krishna, radha athwa radha kii sakhi hai
 All other forms of Indian love - elation, jealousy, anticipation, despair, anger, honor, reunion, and joy, etc
 - are described with great tenacity and skill, except with extreme despair and nihvadhi-disconnection
 prem ke in sabhi roopon kaa varnan atyant rochak, saras or sajiv hone ke atirikt itnaa sundar he ki aisa prathit hota he, maano kavi shaastra, arthath chintan ko bhaavana kaa rup athwa amoort ko moort rup dekar use kavita main parinit kar rahaa he
 Samodamodar akleshkeshav Enchanted madhusudan snigdh madhusudan Sankaksha Pundriksha kunthabaikuntha Nagarnarayan bilakshyalakshmipathi Mandmakund chatur chaturbhuj Sanand damodar supritipitambar Geetgovind is such a poetic work written in the 12th century that tells us about the love of Lord Krishna and Radharani
 isame kul 12 adhyay he
 This poem is the work of Jayadeva, a Brahmin living in a village named Bhubaneswar and Puri in the central state of Odisha state, in the central Kendubilva or Kenduli regime
 jayadev ne unki patni padmavati ke sahayata se is ko aisi rupaantar kiya ki tatkalin utkal ke raja irsha karne lage
 Then, when the principal Jagannathji of Geetagovind told the king in a dream, the devasis of the temple started offering the Odissi dance form in front of Lord Jagannath in the solitary service of the night and in the morning service
 pahele vidwano k maananaa tha ki jayadev bengal ke raja ke sabhakavi he
 But the inscriptions and ancient temples which are present in Odisha proved that Jayadev was a devotee of Jagannath and a resident of Utkal kingdom
 aaj bhi orishi nrity ke madhyam se gitgovind sarvajneen priy ho rahaa he
 The Odissi dance itself indicates Jaydev to be the Odisha province
 unki gitgovind kavy ki prachaar padoshi andhra, tamilnadu tathaa karnataka main hua
 Then it took place in North India, especially in Rajasthan by Mirabai
 gurugranth sahib main bhi bhagat jayadev kaa naam likh he jo gitgovind ke rachayita hai
 The composition and skill of 'geetgovind' poetry is so new and so fundamental that it is difficult to decide its poetry
 kuch paashchaatya vidvan ise ‘graamy-roopak’ kehete hai, to anya sameekshak ise ‘geetinataka’ kehete hai, to kach anyon ke mat main yah kavy ‘parishkrut yatra’ he
 Pichel accepts this poem as a 'musical metaphor'
 levi ise geet or roopak kaa madhyavarti athwa samanvit rup maanate hai, parantu jayadev ne apni is kriti kaa sargon main vibhaajan karke ise naatak ke sthaan par kavy maanane kii apni dharna kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 It is worth mentioning here that in this poetry there is nothing like drama, preface etc
 kuch vidvan ise ‘shringaar mahakavy’ kii sangya bhi dete hai
 Krishnaswamy Iyengar, in his book 'A History of Indian Opera', has considered 'gitagovind' poetry as a complete form of music and its development and excellent acceptance in the sixteenth-century Sri Tirthanarayana Swamy's work 'krishnilila Tarangini'
 is sambandh main acharya baldev upaadhyaay kaa anumaan par aadhrut kathan he ki ‘gitgovind’ ke padon ke saath raagon or taalon ke diye gayi naamon se is tathy kaa anumaan hota he ki kavi kii drushti kadachit un dinon bengal main prachlit yatra mahotsavon kii ore rahi ho, jisamen nrity or sangeet ke saath geeton kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 On this basis, this poem can also be considered as 'musical form'
 maanviya soundarya ke chithran main prakruti ko bada hi mahatvapurn sthaan praapt he
 In this context, in the 'geetgovind' poetry, a beautiful description of Rituraj Vasant, chandra-jyotsna, Surbhit Samir and the seductive keys of the Yamuna coast is seen
 yahaan tak ki is kavy main pakshi tak prem kii shakti or mahima kaa gaan karte hue drushtigochar hote hai
 Jayadeva has used the Vaidarbhi ritual — a style of melodious expressive characters — in this poem
 kavy main kahin-kahin deergh samaason kaa prayog avashya hua he, parantu phir bhi durbodhata athwa clishtataa nahin aane paayi
 In fact, the poet had composed songs only for the songs of the common people on special festivals
 atah unhen subodh rakhana aavashyak hi tha
 The songs not only have exceptional naturalness, but they also have unique melody
 ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana-style kii prashansa main mcdonal kaa kathan he—‘‘soundarya main, sangitamay vachanopanyas main or rachana ke saushthav main sampoorn sanskrit sahitya main ‘gitgovind’ kavy style kii upama nahin milti
 It is clear from the study of poetry that the poet has an amazing ability to make a tremendous impact on his readers and listeners, by the fast stream of short posts, and sometimes by the rhythmic movement of long compositions composed with tact
 kavi naanaa chhandon ke prayog main hi siddhhast nahin, apitu charnon ke madhya or ant main tukatmakataa laane main bhi adwitiya he
 '' ‘gitgovind’ kavy main jayadev ne paramparaagat rachana-pranali kaa anusaran na karke sarvatha naveen or moulik style ko apanaaya he
 The unique use of poetry and melody has been created through the mixed use of verses, prose and song
 kavi ne katha-sutara ke nirvaah ke liye apekshit drishyayojna athwa avasthaa vishesh ke chithran jaise varnanaatmak prasangon main shlokon kaa prayog kiya he
 Prose has been used in interactive contexts that inform the mood of the characters and expressions of emotion have been expressed in verses
 is prakaar ‘gitgovind’ main apanaayi gayi abhinav rachana-pranali main varna, samvaad or geet paraspar is prakaar gunth gayi hai ki unase ek vilakshan anand kii anubhuti hoti he
 Jaidev, the inventor of this unique composition-style, is his own superior
 radha-krishna kii keli-kathaon tathaa unki abhisar-lilaon kaa rasmay chithran ‘gitgovind’ ko aadhyatmik shringaar kaa manoram granth bana detaa he
 This poetic portrayal of radha-krishna's love of life in various poems of love — hope, despair, excitement, jealousy, anger, honor, resentment, ecstasy, message-sending and union, etc
 — is in this poem
 One does not find anywhere even when searching elsewhere
 shrikrishna ke gopiyon ke saath raas-vilaas ko radha na pasand karti he or na hi sahan kar paati hai
 Radha sends her resentment to Shri Krishna through her sakhi, but that unique praniyani is not satisfied with this much, her loving dependence-heart makes her personally reveal her deep affection towards her beloved
 
 radha ke aane par shrikrishna braj-sundariyon kaa sang chhodkar uski ore unmukh hote hai
 Radha's sakhi is a poignant description of the intense affection of Shri Krishna to Radha and Radha to Sri Krishna with each other and the transcendental pain experienced when they are away from each other
 vah apane komal evam kamaneey vachanon dwaara donon ko ek-duusare se milane ke liye prerit karti he
 Radha, impatient with the pangs of anguish when it is moonlight, is unable to control her incestuous affection and is forced into her expression
 shrikrishna ke aane par ati maan karti hui radha upalambh se bhare vachanon ke dwaara unke prati apana rosh-aakrosh prakat karti he
 Here, Radha's friend requests Radha to leave Maan, while Sri Krishna himself tries to persuade and make him friendly, while praising Radha's beauty and beauty
 antatah radha kaa maan dur ho jaataa he or vah apane kaant se milane ke liye kadamb-kunj main jaati he
 While praying to Shri Krishna Radha there, plead with him to give up shame and inhibition and to cooperate in the rituals
 donon prasann man se rati krida main pravrutt hote hai or iske uparant radha pranaysikt vachanon se apane priyatam shrikrishna se apana shringaar karne ko kahati he
 Giving glory to his pranapriya's request, Shri Krishna gladly adorns Radha with his own hands
 aaj ke kuch aalochak jayadev par bhakthi ke aalamban radha-krishna ko shringaar kaa aalamban banane kaa doshaaropan karte hai, parantu maadhurya bhav ke upaask kavi par yah laanchhan anyaaypurna hi nahin, apitu swayan unke apane avivek kaa dyotak he
 In fact, the expression of extreme elitism of solitude or immersion available in married couples, and the expression of clairvoyance of the imagination of the impenetrable in distinction, creates a sense of melody in the field of devotion
 madhur bhav se bhajan karne vaale bhakton ke liye bhagwaan kii shringarik cheshtaaen, vilaas-lilaayen tathaa prem-gaathaayen hi gey evam kirtaneey hai
 It is worth mentioning here that scholars have accepted all this poetry as an 'unprepared praise', an attempt to express the satire hidden in the talk
 unke mat ke anusaar shrikrishna ‘jeevon kii aatma’ ke pratik hai
 The game of gopis is that type of prapancha, in which the souls of humans trapped in ignorance are wandering
 radha brahmanand kaa pratik he, jise praapt karne par hi jeevatma ko charam sukh kii prapti hoti he
 According to some scholars, Jayadev was not a worshiper of Radha but was a worshiper of Shri Krishna
 atah shrikrishna manushyon kii aatma ke pratik na hokar paramatma ke pratik hai
 Acclaiming this fact, Acharya Baldev Upadhyaya writes - "shringar-shiromani Sri Krishna is the representative of Bhagavat-tattva and his beloved gopikas are the symbol of the creature
 radha-krishna kaa milan jeev-brahm kaa milan he
 In this way, the mystery of many facts of cultivation path is solved here
 ’’ 'gitagovind' is indeed a unique and wonderful book, in which the stream of mysterious melody is flowing in the end of boisterous beauty
 samgr sanskrit sahitya main is koti kii madhur rachana duusari koi nahi
 If you want to observe the culmination of beauty and melody of Sanskrit Bharati, then 'geetagovind' should be followed
 iske shabdachitron se soundarya maano chhalakta he
 The elegance of its songs communicates supernatural melody
 iske chhandon kaa naad-soundarya apurv anand pradaan karata he
 The harmony of words and meanings is so enchanting that even a person unfamiliar with Sanskrit cannot live without being influenced by it
 isaki-si komalkant padaavalee sansar kii kisi bhi bhashaa ke kavy main durlabh he
 Even in long spells used in this poetry, there is unique prasadikta and melody
 anupras ke prayog main to kavi adwitiya he
 The use of alliteration in his songs continues not only at the end of the posts but also in the middle
 lalit chhandon or komalkant padaavalee kaa aisa mani-kanchan sanyog hua he ki geeton ke uccharan maatr se sahrudayon ke hriday main tadnurup ras kaa aavirbhaav evam sanchaar hone lagata he
 This unique style has proved very meaningful for the euphemism of dressing
 ‘gitgovind’ ko badi hi prasiddhi or lokapriyata mili
 The village in which Jaidev lived and composed 'geetgovind', the name of that village became Jaidevpur
 kavi ke samakaleen urisa ke shaasha raja pratap rudradev ne apane rajya ke gayakon, sangitagnon or nartakon ke liye ‘gitgovind’ ke padon ko gane kaa aadesh jari kar diya
 Maharaj honored Jayadev with the title of 'kaviraj Raja' for this poetic composition
 ‘gitgovind’ jayadev ke jivan kaal main hi paryaapt rup se prachlit evam lokapriy ho gaya tha—iske anek pramaan milte hai
 In the south, it became so popular that its verses were carved in the Dravin script on the stairs of the temple of Tirupati Balaji
 shreevallabh sampradaay main to shrimadbhagwat puraana ke samaan isaki pratishtha he
 There is a belief among Vaishnavas that where 'geetagovind' is sung, there is a presence of God
 isi se is sampradaay main ise ayogy sthaan par na gaaye jane kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he, jiskaa kathorta se paalan kiya jaataa he
 In the Vaishnava community, the poet Jayadeva is considered to be the chief noble of the medieval state of this community
 sampradaay main prachlit nimnokt padya ke anusaar jis vaishnav sampradaay ke pravartan vishnu swami ne kiya or jiskaa sanvardhan mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ne kiya, us sampradaay ko in donon mahanubhavon ke madhya main bhakt kavi jayadev ne sangrakshan diya
 In this way Jayadeva is also worshipable as a Guru in the Vaishnava sect
 jayadev ne ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana karke sanskrit main ek naveen rachana-pranali kaa avishkaar kiya
 Many songs such as 'abhinav Geetagovind', 'geetraghava', 'geetagadhar' and 'krishnagit' were composed in Sanskrit on the emulation of 'gitagovind', but no poet was able to bring excellence like 'geetgovind' in his poetry
 idhar hindi main bharatendu harishchandr ne brajabhasha main iske anuwaad kaa prayaas kiya, parantu ‘sachhee kavita’ kaa anuwaad to ho hi nahin saktaa—yah ukti ‘gitgovind’ ke sambandh main aksharshah satya siddh hui he
 The translation of the essence of the original composition in translation is difficult, if not impossible
 sar wiliam jones dwaara angl bhashaa main kiye gayi ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke anuwaad par german kavi gete kii tippanee badi hi sateek he
 'A Real Poetry is that, which cannot be translated
' That is, the basis of identification of excellent poetry is that it cannot be translated into another language
 ‘gitgovind’ ke marm ko samajhane tathaa sahrudayon tak uske soundarya ko sampreshya banane ke liye pantis vidwaanon ke prayaas uplabdh hai, parantu yah kavy to vah agaadh sagar he ki isamen jo jitani gahari dubkee lagaataa he
 Equally rare and precious gems come in his hand
 katipay kaviyon dwaara is kavy ke anukaran par kavy-rachana karnaa jayadev kii kirti-kaumudi kii ujjvalata tathaa utkrushtataa kii sweekruti kaa hi parichaayak he
 The 'geetagovind' poem of devotion, adornment and poetry has another significant significance in krishna-bhakti literature
 yah sarvajan vidit tathy he ki is kavy se purv shrikrishna kii preyasi athwa patni ke rup main rukmini tathaa satyabhama aadi kaa naam hi liya jaataa tha
 There was no existence of a woman named Radha
 shrimadbhagwat puraana main ‘anairadhito nunam’ shrikrishna kii aradhana karne vaali kisi ek gopi kaa ullekh avashya hua he, parantu krishna-kavy main krishna ke saath judane vaali krishna ke hi samakaksh mahatva praapt karne vaali shrikrishna kii premika-patni radha kaa ullekh kahin nahin hua
 'geetagovindakar' Jaidev has the credit for making Radha distinguished at this high place — the exclusive companion of Shri Krishna and integral to him and his eternal strength
 is granth main chitrit radha-krishna ke nity-vilaas ke aadhaar par hi brahmavaivart puraana main radha-krishna kii shringaar-cheshtaaon tathaa kaam-kridaaon kaa varnan hua he, parantu yah ek kathor satya he ki puranakar na to ‘gitgovind’ kavy ke varnan jaisi maryaada or shaleenta kaa nirvaah kar sakaa he or na hi varnan ko vaisaa saras, rochak evam hridaygrahya bana sakaa he
 In this area too, Jaidev is his superior
 is aadhaar par hi kadachit krishna-bhakthi sahitya main ‘gitgovind’ kavy ko dharmagranth kaa gaurav praapt he
