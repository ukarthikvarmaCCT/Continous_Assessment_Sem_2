 Mammatt has stated six purposes of poetry - kavita yaa kavy kya he is vishay main bhartiya sahitya main aalochakon kii badi samrudh parampara he— acharya vishwanath, panditraj jagannatha, pandit ambikadutt vyas, acharya shripati, bhamah aadi sanskrit ke vidwaanon se lekar aadhunik acharya ramchandra shukla tathaa jaishankar prasad jaise prabud kaviyon or aadhunik yug kii mira mahadevi verma ne kavita kaa swaroop spasht karte hue apane apane mat vyakt kiye hai
 Scholars believe that the human heart wanders in the infinite form, trades of the eternal world, but when the human ego abandons the spirit and remains a pure feeling, then it becomes a free heart
 hriday kii is mukti kii sadhana ke liye manushya kii vaani jo shabd vidhaan karti ai he use kavita kehete hai
 Poetry elevates human beings from the narrow circle of selfish relationships and helps in making a raga connection with the rest of creation
 kavy kii anek paribhaashaayen di gai hai
 These definitions also hold true for modern Hindi poetry
 kavy siddh chitt ko alokik anandanubhuti karaata he to hriday ke taar zankrut ho uthte hai
 Poetry also contains the feeling of Satyam Shiva Sundaram
 jis kavy main yah sab kuch paaya jaataa he vah uttam kavy mana jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of poetry: swaroop ke aadhaar par kavy ke do bhed hai - shravyakavy evam drushyakavy
 The poetry which is praised by listening to others or reading by itself is called audible poetry
 jaise ramayana or mahabharat
 Audio poetry also has two distinctions - Prabandha poetry and Muktak poetry
 isamen koi pramukh katha kavy ke aadi se ant tak krambaddh rup main chalati he
 The sequence of the story breaks in the middle and secondary stories become helpful in between
 jaise ramcharita maanas
 There are two distinctions of management poetry - epic and Khandakavya
 1- mahakavy isamen kisi aitihaasik yaa puranic mahapurush kii sampurna jivan katha kaa adyopant varnan hota he

 It is necessary to have these things in the section Poetry- isamen keval ek hi pad yaa chand swatantra rup se kisi bhav yaa ras athwa katha ko prakat karne main samarth hota he
 The songs, poets, doha etc
 are free
 jis kavy kii anandanubhuti abhinay ko dekhakar evam paatro se cathopakathan ko sun kar hoti he use drishy kavy kehete hai
 Like in a drama or a movie
 1- padya kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan kavy main kiya jaataa he, jaise gitanjali 2- Prose Poetry - In this, a story is described in prose, such as Jaishankar's commission
 
 
 gadhy main kavy rachana karne ke liye kavi ko chand shaastra ke niyamon se svachhndatha praapt hoti he
 3- Champu Poetry - It consists of both prose and poetry
 maithilisharan gupt kii 'yashodhara' champu kavy he
 The history of modern Hindi poetry is about 800 years old and its beginning is understood from the thirteenth century
 har bhashaa kii tarah hindi kavita bhi pehle itivrittatmak thi
 That is, a story was tied with a rhythm and decorated with ornaments
 bhartiya sahitya ke sabhi pracheen granth kavita main hi likhe gaye hai
 The specific reason for this was that poetry was easy to memorize due to the rhythm and verses
 jis samay chhapekhane kaa avishkaar nahin hua tha or dastavezon kii anek pratiyaan bananaa aasaan nahin tha us samay mahatvapurn baton ko yaad rakh lene kaa yah sarvottam saadhan tha
 That is why at that time, along with literature, politics, science and Ayurveda were also written in the verse itself
 bharat kii pracheenatam kavitaayen sanskrit bhashaa main rugveda main hai jinamein prakruti kii prashasti main likhe gaye chhandon kaa sundar sankalan hai
 Many other subjects of life have also found place in these poems

 The best known and most extensive are the lowland evergreen broadleaf rainforests include, for example: the seasonally inundated varzea and igapó forests and the terra firme forests of the Amazon Basin; the peat forests and moist dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia; and the high forests of the Congo Basin
 The forests of tropical mountains are also included in this broad category, generally divided into upper and lower montane formations on the basis of their physiognomy, which varies with altitude

 There are many facts which indicate that historically, the ancientness of Chhattisgarh region touches the Ramayana era
 us kaal main dandakarany naam se prasiddh yah vanachhadit praant arya-samskruti kaa prachaar kendra tha
 In the solitary forests of this place, sages and monks lived and meditated
 inamen valmiki, atri, agastya, sutikshn pramukh the isiliye dandakarany main pravesh karte hi ram in sabake ashramon main gayi
 Even in the era of Rama, the Kosala kingdom was divided into North Kosala and South Kosala
 kalidas ke raghuvansh kavy main ullekh he ki ram ne apane putr lav ko sharavati kaa or kush ko kushavathi kaa rajya diya tha
 If Sharavati and Shravasti are considered one, then surely the kingdom of Love was in North India and Kush became the ruler of Dakshin Kosala
 sambhavtah unki rajdhani kushavathi aaj ke bilaspur jile main thi, shaayad kosla gram hi us kaal kii kushavathi thi
 Even if Kosala is considered the birthplace of Kaushalya, the mother of Ram, there does not seem to be any discrepancy
 raghuvansh ke anusaar kush ko ayodhya jane ke liye vindhyaachal ko paar karnaa padataa tha isse bhi siddh hota he ki unka rajya dakshin koshal main hi tha
 It is clear from all the above quotes that Chhattisgarh has been a holy place for sages, sages and ascetics since time immemorial
 prathit hota he ki chota nagpur se lekar bastar tathaa katak se le kar satara tak ke bikhare huye rajwanshon ko sangathit kar ram ne vanar sena banaai ho
 RP Vance Agnew writes, "in general there is a tradition of belief that the kings of Ratanpur have been ruling since such an ancient period that they are related to the animal stories described in Hindu 'mythology'
 satara ke narpathi, katak ke gajpati, bastar ke rathpati or ratanpur ke ashwapati hai" 
 Ashwa and Haihay are synonymous
 shri agnew kaa mat he ki kaalaantar main 'ashwapati' hi haihay vanshi ho gayi
 It is clear from this that the relation of these four dynasties is very ancient and their dynasties have been named on the basis of the organs of Chaturangini army
 bastar ke shaskaon kaa 'rathpati' hone ke pramaan swaroop aaj bhi dashahara main rath nikaala jaataa he tathaa danteshwari mata kii puja kii jaati he
 This is the preservation of that tradition of Rama when Rama departed towards Lanka on the day of Dussehra by worshiping Shakti
 raajaaon kii oopaadhiyon se yah spasht hota he ram ne chhattisgarh pradesh ke tatkaaleen vanya raajaaon ko sangathit kiya or chaturangini sena kaa nirmaan kar unhen narpathi, gajpati, rathpati or ashwapati oopaadhiyaan pradaan kii
 Thus, from the time of Ramayana, the state of Chhattisgarh became the Leela site of Ram and the center of Aryan culture in South India

 In the process of photosynthesis, simple carbohydrates and later complex carbohydrates are formed by the addition of carbon dioxide and water inside the cells of green leaves of plants in the presence of sunlight
 is prakriya main oxygen evam urja se bharpoor carbohydrate aadi) kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxygen gas baahar nikalati he
 Water, carbon dioxide, sunlight and chlorophyll are called components of photosynthesis
 isamen se jal tathaa carbondioxide ko prakaash sanshleshan kaa kaccha maal kaha jaataa he
 The process of photosynthesis is one of the most important biochemical reactions

 It has been known since ancient times that plants get their nutrition through roots
 1772 main stephen heles ne bataaya ki paudhon kii pattiyaan vaayu se bhojan grahan karti hai tathaa is kriya main prakaash kii kuch mahatvapurn kriya he
 Priestley first told in 1772 that if a candle is lit in the air generated during this process, it keeps on burning
 mombatti jalane ke pashchaat utpann vaayu main yadi ab ek jivit chuha rakhaa jaye to vah mar jaataa he
 He again stated in 1775 that the gas released by the plants during the day is oxygen

 Mother-in-law reported in 1887 that starch is produced in plants by ingesting CO2 and extracting o2 of green plants
 hare paudhon main hone vaali prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya paudhon evam anya jivit praaniyon ke liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kriya he
 In this process, plants convert sunlight energy into chemical energy and complex carbon compounds become carbohydrates from simple substances like CO2 water
 in carbohydrates dwaara hi manushya evam jivit praaniyon ko bhojan praapt hota he
 In this way, plants make food for the whole animal world by the process of photosynthesis
 carbohydrates protein evam vitamin aadi ko praapt karne ke liye vibhinn fasalein ugaai jaati hai tathaa in sab padaarthon kaa nirmaan prakaash sanshleshan dwaara hi hota he
 Rubber, plastics, oils, cellulose and many drugs are also produced in photosynthesis in plants

 Some sea snails ingest algae etc
 plants through their diet and use the chloroplasts present in them for photosynthesis
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbondioxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials

 It is recognized by all scientists in the modern era that in oxygenation, free oxygen comes from water
 aadhunik samay main anek prayogon ke aadhaar par yah siddh ho chukaa he ki prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya nimna do charnon main sampann hoti he
 In the first stage, the light process or the hill process or the photochemical process
 or duusare charan main andheri prakriya athwa blekaman prakriya yaa prakashahin prakriya
 In the process of photosynthesis, both processes take place after each other
 prakaash prakriya andheri prakriya kii upeksha adhik teji se hoti he
 Photosynthesis occurs in all chloroplast-containing cells of the plant
 arthath paudhe ke samast hare bhaagon main hoti he
 This action occurs especially in the mesophyll tissue of the leaves because the parenchyma cells of the mesophyll tissue of the leaves have a greater amount of chloroplast than other cells
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main jo prakriya prakaash kii upasthiti main hoti he use prakaash kriya ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This activity was studied by other scientists like Hill
 prakaash prakriyaaon ke samay andheri prakriyaayen seemaabaddh kaarak kaa kaary karti hai
 Lighting processes take place in two stages, photolysis and placement of hydrogen
 photolysis kii prakriya main prakaash chlorophyl ke anu dwaara photone ke rup main avashoshit kii jaati he
 When the chlorophyll molecule absorbs one quantum of light, the second molecule of chlorophyll does not absorb the light until the first energy is used in the process of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl dwaara is prakaar shoshit prakaash kaa photone ucch urja str par ek electron nikaalati he tathaa yah shakti phosphate ke tisare band par sthit hokar ucch urja vaale adinosine tryphosphate ke rup main prakat hote hai
 Thus Chloropil produces ATP in the presence of light and this process is called phosphorylation
 is prakaar surya ke prakaash kii urja atipi arthath rasinic urja main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Thus, the ATP produced in the chlorophyll molecule is helpful in many chemical reactions such as CO2 being deoxidized into sugars, separated from the chlorophyll molecule
 chlorophyl is atipi ko swatantra karne par phir akriy ho jaataa he
 According to Van Neil Frank, Wishnik, when water comes into contact with this functional chlorophyll, the water is dissected in unoxidized h and strong oxidizing OH
 chlorophyl + prakaash → sakriy chlorophiliah2o + sakriy chlorophyl → H+ + oh-is photolysis prakriya main O2 pani se swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen bhi hydrogen graahak par chali jaati he
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 Thus all the oxygen released from the photosynthetic activities of plants is derived from water
 hill, ruben ne iskaa samarthan kiya tathaa O18 kaa prayog karke isko siddh kiya
 Oxygen release from water was shown to be in the absence of CO2 in an algae called Chlorilla
 iskaa arth hua ki CO2 kii anupasthiti main oxygen kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he, parantu isamen hydrogen graahak hona chahie
 It has been observed that NADP forms two NADPH2 in plants
 2H2O+2NADP=2NADPH2+O2 According to Aranan, light action is mainly related to construction
 NADPH2 / NADP ke avkaran se banataa he
 NADP is also known as TPN
 atipi ek prakaash urja anu he jo edipi main ek phosphate group ke judane se banataa he tathaa is kriya ko phosforilation kehete hai
 Phosphorylation of ADP requires light energy, so it is also called photo-phosphorylation
 yah bhi ek jatil kriya he tathaa aranan ke anusaar prakaash prakriya do prakramon main hoti he
 Combination photo-phosphorylation and Pair photo-phosphorylation In the photo-phosphorylation, electrons are continuously obtained due to the decomposition of water and ATP is produced by light energy in chlorophyll on the action of photo-phosphorylation
 is prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ke sakriy hone par pheredoxin electron grahi kaa kaary karti he jise enedipi naamak coenzyme ko detaa he jisamen enedy pani dwaara mukt kii gai hydrogen ko pakad kar NADPH2 main parivartit ho jaataa he
 In this way, the free electrons dissolved in water are excited at chlorophyll 'b' and reach a higher energy level, and these electrons are again obtained by the type chlorophyll 'a', it is not fully known but it is believed That the electron receptor called plastokavinone captures these electrons which then revert to chlorophyll 'a' by the cytochrome
 isamen saath-saath atipi kaa bhi nirmaan hota he
 In the process of pair photo-phosphorylation, chlorophyll 'a' is activated by sunlight and throws electrons out which are captured by the ferridoxine present in chlorophyll
 yahi electron mukt hokar plastoquinon naamak electron grahi dwaara pakad liya jaataa he
 In the middle of this action, ADP is converted to ATP and the electron is released again and goes back to the chlorophyll 'a' via the cytochrome wicker
 is kriya main bhi edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he
 External electrons are not used in this activity and the electron comes out of chlorophyll and comes back there again
 is prakaar ayugma va yugma prakriyaaon dwaara pani vighatit ho jaataa he jisase oxigen gas swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen, hydrogen grahi enedipi dwaara pakad lee jaati he tathaa saath hi saath urja bhi vargeekrut ho jaati he jiskaa prayog rasinic prakriya yaa aprakashiya pratikriya main hota he
 Oxygen and photosynthesis is prakriya ke liye prakaash kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Carbon dioxide is often degraded in this process
 is prakriya main pattee ke stomata dwaara grahan kii gai carbondioxide, pani se nikali hydrogen prakaash kii urja ke kaaran milakar ek sthaayee dravya banaata he
 CH2O, it is a unit molecule of carbohydrates
 kelvin va banson ne radio isotopic takanic kaa prayog kar bataaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii prakriya main pehla sthai yogic ek 3 carbon vaala 3-phosphoglicerick amla banataa he
 Photosynthesis was carried out briefly in the presence of radioactive C14O2 in algae called Chlorolla and Syndesmus, and these also formed the first stable liquid phosphoglyceric acid
 yah phosphoglicerick amla baad main glucose banaata he
 Thus it was proved by the work of Calvin and his colleagues that CO2 is converted into glucose in the photosynthesis process
 unhone is prayog main carbon ke samasthanik kaa prayog kiya
 Chlorophyll contains ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 ab vayumandaleey CO2 pattee ke stomata dwaara pravesh kar andar pahunchati he tathaa turant hi ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate ke saath milakar ek asthai yogic kaa nirmaan kati he
 The temporary compound thus formed, which is 5-carbon sugar, soon breaks down into 2 molecules of phosphoglyceric acid
 ab yahaan par NADPH2 dwaara hydrogen mukt kiye jane par pijie ko pijieel main parivartit kar detaa he
 Energy is obtained from ATP in this activity
 is prakaar CO2 se carbohydrates nirmaan ho jate hai
 In the dark process of photosynthesis, plants in which the first permanent compound phosphoglyceric acid is formed are called C3 plant
 phosphoglissrik amla ek 3 carbon vaala yogic he isliye in paudhon kaa aisa namakaran he
 The plants in which the first permanent compound forms a compound of 4 carbons are called C4 plants
 saadharantah 4 carbon vaala yogic oxaloecetic amla banataa he
 It was previously believed that only C3 or Calvin cycle occurred during the stabilization or fixation of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, that is, the first stable compound is phosphoglyceric acid
 lekin 1966 main hech evam slack ne bataaya ki carbondioxide ke sthirikaran kaa ek doosraa path bhi he
 He studied in sugarcane, maize, amaranthus, etc
 that phosphoinol pyruvic acid, which is a 3-carbon specific compound, combines with carbon dioxide to form 4-carbon-specific compound oxaloacetic acid
 is kriya main phosphoinol piruveet carboxillage injim utprerak kaa kaary karata he
 There are four main components in the process of photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, light and foliage
 in chaaron kii upasthiti is kriya ke liye ati aavashyak he
 Of these, water and carbon dioxide are called raw materials for photosynthesis because the main products of photosynthesis are the formation of carbohydrates by their creative ingredients
 in avyavo ko paudha apane aas-paas ke vaataavaran se grahan karata he
 Carbon dioxide is a major component and raw material of photosynthesis
 vayumandal main carbondioxide gas shwasan, dahan, kinvan, vighatan aadi kriyaaon ke dwaara mukt hoti he
 Its volume in air is 0
03% to 0
04%
 sthaliy paudhe ise sidhe hi vaayu se grahan kar lete hai
 The leaves of these plants have small holes called parnandhra
 carbondioxide inhen parnarandhron se paudhe kii pattiyon main pravesh karti he
 Submerged plants ingest carbon dioxide dissolved in water by diffusing it from their physical surface
 jal main carbondioxide kaa strot jaleey jantu hai, jinke shwasan main yah gas utpann hoti he
 The decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate present in the underwater rocks also produces carbon dioxide which aquatic plants consume in photosynthesis
 prakaash-sanshleshan main glucose naamak carbohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he
 In this, carbon and oxygen atoms are obtained from carbon dioxide
 chlorophyl chlorophyl ek proteinous jatil rasinic yogic he
 It is the main pigment of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl e tathaa chlorophyl bi do prakaar kaa hota he
 It is found in chloroplasts of all autotrophic green plants
 chlorophyl ke anu surya ke prakaashiya urja ko avashoshit kar use rasinic urja main roopaantarit karte hai
 Chlorophyll molecules are excited by absorbing the Sun's optical energy
 ye sakriy anu jal ke anuon ko H+ tathaa OH- aayan main vighatit kar dete hai
 Thus chlorophyll molecules initiate the biochemical activity of photosynthesis
 prakaash surya kaa prakaash prakaash-sanshleshan ke liye aavashyak he
 Photosynthesis also takes place in the intense artificial light of bulbs etc
 laal rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 This action is most common in red after purple
 ye donon rang chlorophyl dwaara sarvaadhik adhik maatra main avashoshit kiye jate hai
 The green color reflects chlorophyll completely, so photosynthesis stops completely in every color
 jal jal prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya kaa kaccha maal he
 Terrestrial plants absorb it from soil by root roots
 jaleey paudhe apane jal ke sampark vaale bhaagon kii bahya sataha se jal kaa avasorana karte hai
 Uprooting plants such as orchids absorb atmospheric water vapor through their pneumatic roots
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke prakaashiya abhikriya main jal ke prakaashiya vighatan se oxigen utpann hota he
 This oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct
 adheri abhikriya main banane vaali glucose ke anuon main hydrogen tatv ke anu jal se hi praapt hote hai
 Water also performs indirect functions during photosynthesis
 yah jeevadravya kii kriyasheeltaa tathaa injime kii sakriyata ko banaae rakhata he
 Photosynthesis is affected by many factors
 iske kuch kaarak bahya hote hai tathaa kuch aantarik
 Additionally there are some limiting factors
 bahya kaaran ve hote he jo prakruti or paryaavaran main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan ko prabhavit karte hai jaise prakaash, chunki surya ke prakaash se paudha is kriya ke liye urja praapt karata he tathaa andhere se yah kriya sambhav hi nahin he
 Carbon dioxide, because it has been observed that if all other factors are obtained in the highest amount by the plant and the amount of CO2 is gradually increased in the atmosphere, the rate of photosynthesis also increases
 taapmaana, kyo ki dekha gaya he ki paudhon main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ke liye ek nishchit tapakram kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tathaa jal, pani photochemical prakriyaaon ke atyant aavashyak he or yah is kriya ke samay anek rasinic parivartanon main sahyog karata he
 Internal causes are those that affect the action of photosynthesis by being located in the leaves, such as foliage or chlorophyll by which light energy is converted into chemical energy
 praras / jeevadravya / puras yaa protoplasm jisamen paae jane vaale vikar prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai
 The deposition of food, because if the food produced in the process of photosynthesis continues to accumulate in the local cells, the rate of photosynthesis slows down
 pattiyon kii aantarik sanrachana kyon ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar pattiyon main upasthit stomata yaa randhron kii sankhya tathaa unke band evam khulne ke samay par nirbhar karti he
 Age of leaves, as new leaves have higher rates of photosynthesis of older leaves
 iske atirikt prakaash sanshleshan ko in sabhi vastuon kii alag-alag gati bhi prabhavit karti he
 When an action of photosynthesis is controlled by various factors, the speed of photosynthesis is controlled by the slowest factor
 prakaash, carbondioxide, jal, chlorophyl ityadi main se jo bhi uchit pariman se kam pariman main hota he, vah puri kriya kii gati ko niyantrit rakhata he
 This factor is called time-bounded factor

 Optical energy is used in the presence of foliage and oxygen is released as a by-product
 prakaash sanshleshan ek anksikaran - avkaran prakriya he jisamen jal kaa prakaashik oxikaran tathaa CO 2 kaa aprakashik avkaran hota he or carbonic yogic banate he tathaa oxygen mukt hoti he
 Mechanism of Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is a very complex process, which is mainly carried out in two terms - 1 optical reaction and 2 unpublished reaction, 1
 Optical Reaction - In order to harness the energy of sunlight and to make hydrogen available by the dissolution of water, these activities take place in the presence of light in the particles called grana inside the green lantern
 in kanon main parnaharim yaa chlorophyl naamak padaarth hota he
 These actions can be summarized as follows: Due to the radiation energy of sunlight, the chlorophyll molecules become active and expel the energetically excited electrons
 sakriy chlorophyl se aavashyak urja praapt kar jal ke anuon kaa vichchhedan hota he jisase hydrogen tathaa anxigen praapt hoti he|agar aapako bhi ganit lagati he acchhee to aapkaa bhavishya he ujjwal, jane kaise? uttejit elevatron ek vishesh tantra, jise elevatron sthaanantaran tantra kehete he, ke dwaara apni urja de dete he
 This energy is stored in ADP molecules by leaving a phosphate group and leaving
 praapt anxizan paudhe se baahar nikal jaati hai
 The hydrogen obtained is collected by the receptor material called NADP
 isamen NADP
H 2 kaa nirmaan hota he
 2
 Unpublished Reaction - Light is not required for these actions
 in abhikriyaaon ko inaki khoj karne vaale vaigyanik ke naam ke aadhaar par bluecoman abhikriyaayein kehete hai
 These actions take place in the pelvic or stroma of the larynx
 in samast kriyaaon ko, jo ek vishesh padaarth ribulos biphosphate kii upasthiti main ek chakra ke rup main hoti he, calvin chakra bhi kehete hai
 In a nutshell, these reactions can be expressed as follows: In the presence of certain substances, CO 2 obtained from the atmosphere is degraded from h + of NADP
H 2 obtained from optical activity and forms a substance called PGAL
 in kriyaao main agralikhit abhikriyaayein sammilit he- 5 carbon vaale yogic rubp ke saath carbon dianksaide ke anu milakar ek 6 carbon asthaayee yogic kaa nirmaan karte he- yah asthaayee yogic sheeghra hi apachayit hokar va tuutakar do anu PGA bana letaa he
 It is a three-carbon compound - PGA molecules subsequently become more reduced, forming PGAL
 PGAL ke do anu milakar tathaa apchayan ke dwaara phosphate sharkara kaa tathaa baad main sharkara kaa nirmaan kar lete hai
 PGAL itself can also act like food
 yah teen carbon parmaanu vaala yogic he
 Its two molecules combine to form one molecule of glucose
 glucose se hi anya sabhi prakaar ke bhojya padaarthon, jaise - protein, vasa, mand ityadi kaa nirmaan bhi paudhe ke andar hi ho jaataa he
 In the Calvin cycle, PGAL and its products also regenerate ribulose biphosphate, which means that it is remodeled to run the reactions of the cycle

 It also takes about 1-2 hours per day to make upla
 atah khaanaa pakaane hetu gobar ke upalon ke sthaan par gobar se baio gas bana kar baio gas ko eendhan ke rup main prayog karne se poshak tatwon ki haani nahin hoti he kyonki baio gas se praapt baio gas slori main paudhon ke liye upyogi sabhi poshak tatva uplabdh rahete he, saath hi khaanaa banane main dhunaa nahin hota he jisase gruhani ki aankhon par koi pratikul asar bhi nahin padataa he
 Drying the bio gas slurry directly or under shade or by making vermicompost should be used in the fields as compost
 baio gas se aajkal dijal pump set bhi chalaa sakate he jisase dijal evam anya urja ki bachat hoti he
 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefit is like chemical fertilizer immediately on the crop and in production 10 to 20 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased

 This is often the cheapest, quickest and simplest method to grow more and more plants
 tahani ke kartan lagane ko mali log "khanti gaadna" kehete hai
 Some people also call it "planting a pen", but the use of the word pen is appropriate in the same relation in which the organ of one plant is planted at the root of another
 daaba main nae padap tabhi jad phenkate hai jab ve apane mul vriksh se sambhddha rahete hai
 There are three types of plant breeding by this method: Top pressure - In this type the top of a twig is bent downwards and roots reach out when it reaches the ground
 iske sabase sundar udhaaharan respberi or loganberi hai
 Simple pressure - For this, tilt the twig and put soil on it as needed

 As per the wishes of the pruner for figurative plants, they can be given conical form, canopy etc
 and sometimes they are given the form of elephant, horse etc
, but the fruit trees are usually given the form of urn or flower
 And the central part is not allowed to be dense
 chhantai kaa uddeshy yah hota he ki padap ke praaia: anaavashyak bhaag nikaal die jaaen jisase bachaa hua bhaag adhik utpaadan kar sake yaa adhik sundar, pusht or swasth ho jaae

 There is generally a great need for plowing in cultivation and flower cultivation
 bharat kii adhikansh jagahon main falon ke udyaan main bhoomi par ghaas ugna vaanchhneeya nahin he or isliye thodi bahut godai aavashyak ho jaati he
 There is no doubt that the primary purpose of weeding or hoofing is the elimination of unwanted weeds, so it should be done only when they are small and have not deep-rooted their roots
 yah karshan chhichhlaa hona chahie taaki tarkari, phool yaa falon kii jadon ko haani na pahunche
 Light traction and weeding is good once after every irrigation in the dry season
 iske saath hi falon kii udyanbhumi ko, kam-se-kam garmi main or phir ek baar barsaat main, palatanevaale hal se avashya jot dena chahie
 When to plow is also important

 Such loss is more in heavy soil than light soil
 saadhaarant: jotai vahi acchhee hoti he jo paryaapt sukhi bhoomi par kii jaae, parantu bhoomi itani sukhi bhi na rahe ki bade-bade chippad ukhdane lagen
 Spraying of special chemical substances without plowing in fruit orchards and fertilizer fields has also proved useful
 yadi padpon kii paraspar duuri thik he to falon ke nae udyaan main bahut si bhoomi aisi padi rahegi jo varshon tak falwaale vrikshon ke kaam main na aegi

 How much water is given and when it is given depends on which plant and season
 gamale main lage paudhon ko sukhi ritu main prati din pani dena aavashyak he
 For all plants, the land should remain moist so that their floods do not stop
 falon ke bhi samuchit vikaas ke liye nirantar pani kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 It should be remembered that the moisture content in the soil should never be so low that the plants wither away and cannot grow again
 acchhee sinchai vahi he jisamen pani kam se kam maatra main kharaab jaae
 This malfunction can occur for a number of reasons: water flowing from the upper surface, penetrating to unnecessary depths, evaporation from the upper surface, and the necessary water being drained by the weeds

 But how much an element can get to the plant depends on many things, such as which mineral is present in the soil, how much of the soil is in the form of soil, how much moisture is in the soil and its acidity
 adhikansh fasalon ke liye bhoomi main nitrogen, fasphoras tathaa potacium daalana upyogi paaya gaya he, kyonki ye tatv vibhinn fasalon dwaara newnaadhik maatra main nikal jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to see that the balance of these elements of the land remains as per the requirement of the plants
 kisi ek tatv ke bahut adhik maatra main daalane se duusare tatwon main kami yaa asantulan utpann ho saktaa he, jisase upaj main kami aa sakati he
 Nitrogen and botanical substances are the most important parts of manure for Indian soil
 yah samaran rahe ki bhoomi-bhoomi main antar hota he; isliye is sambandh main koi ek vyapak nuskhaa nahin bataaya ja saktaa jiskaa prayog sarvatra kiya ja sake
 Some nitrogen-giving items are: - Organic sources: compost of dung, droppings, urine, garbage, etc
; Khali and green crops that can be used as manure, such as linseed, tinapatiya moong, dhencha etc
 ajivajanit strot : uria, jisamen 40 pratishat nitrogen hota he, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate tathaa sodium nitrate 
 Ordinary: 50 to 12 pounds of nitrogen per acre in the land can be expected to be satisfactory
 yah sambhav he ki fasphoras bhoomi main paryaapt maatra main rahe, parantu padpon ko keval dhire-dhire praapt ho
 It has been observed that sometimes where other crops were very poor, the fruit garden flourishes very well without adding phosphorus material to the ground, probably because the fruit trees need phosphorus gradually
 It only happens
 khaadon main tathaa sabhi prakaar ke jeevajanit padaarthon main kuch-na-kuch fasphoras rahata he
 But the phosphorous special things are these - bone powder, basic slag and super phosphate which are used extensively
 isamen 16 se 40 pratishat fasphoras pentaxide rahata he
 In those soils that stabilize phosphorus, the first phosphorus must be added so that some phosphorus is left for plants even when stabilized, but those that do not stabilize phosphorus should not contain a large amount of phosphorus, Otherwise the balance will deteriorate and other components will fall
 jis bhoomi main sulabh potacium kii maatra bahut hi kam hoti he usamen potacium dene par darshneey antar padataa he, jo upaj kii vruddhi se spasht ho jaataa he
 Potassium sulfate and potassium chloride are commonly used for fertilizer
 inamen se prayek main lagbhag 50 pratishat potacium oxide hota he
 Potassium nitrate contains 44 percent potassium oxide; Along with this, 13 percent nitrogen is also present
 jeevajanit khaadon main bhi 50 pratishat yaa adhik potacium oxide ho saktaa he

 The transformation into a unified state actually occurred more sequentially than the ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes

 The strong institution of governance developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize the state's control over land, labor, and the resources that were necessary for the survival and development of ancient Egyptian civilization

 The pharaohs also provided land to their morgue cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the necessary resources to worship the pharaoh after his death
 By the end of the ancient empire, five centuries of these feudal practices gradually eroded the economic power of the pharaohs, now incapable of maintaining a vast centralized administration

 Freed from their loyalty to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power
 2160 BC Till, the rulers of Herakleopolis held control of Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt

 Around 2055 BC, the Theban forces, under the command of Nebhepetre Mantuhotep II, eventually defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers and reintegrated the two territories to begin an economic and cultural renaissance period, known as the Middle Kingdom

 The successors of Mantuhotep II and his 11th descendant ruled from Thebes, but at the beginning of the 12th dynasty in 1985 BC
 Wazir Amenemhat I, around power, transferred the capital of the country to the city of Iztawi in Fayum
 From Ijtawi, the pharaohs of the 12th dynasty planned land reforms and irrigation with foresight to increase agricultural production in the region
 In addition, the army reclaimed areas of Nubia enriched by mines and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the East Delta to protect against foreign attack, called "walls-of-the-ruler" " where did it go
 sainya or raajnneetik suraksha or vishaal krishi or khanij sampada behaal karne ke baad, is desh kii aabaadi, kala or dharm kaa utkarsh hone laga
 In contrast to the ancient empire's elitist view of the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in the sense of personal piety and what might be called the democratization of rebirth, in which all people have a soul and after death in the communion of the gods They can be welcomed

 The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Asian settlers in the delta region to provide sufficient manpower for their particularly active mining and construction operations
 These ambitious activities of construction and mining, however, combined with the inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, made the economy tense and prompted a second intermediate period with a slow decline during the 13th and 14th dynasties

 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic relations with their neighbors
 The military campaigns waged under the command of Thutmose i and his grandson Thutmose III spread the influence of the pharaohs to Syria and Nubia, which strengthened loyalty and gave them access to important imports such as brass and wood
 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom began a massive construction campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak
 He also constructed monuments in glorification of his achievements, both real and imaginary
 The female pharaoh Hatshepsut used such propaganda to justify her claim to the throne

 1279 BC Nearby, Ramesses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne and continued to build more temples, statues and obliques and produced significantly more offspring than any other pharaoh in history
 Being an adventurous military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh and after fighting to an impasse, eventually 1258 BC

 Greek influence increased rapidly as the city of Naukratis in the Delta became home to the Greeks
 Situated in the new capital of Sis, the site kings saw a brief but enthusiastic revival in economy and culture, but by 525 BC
 In, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began conquering Egypt and eventually succeeded in capturing the pharaoh Samtik III at the Battle of Pelusim
 Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home in Susa, leaving Egypt under the control of a centurion

 Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies faced the challenges of native contradiction, incisive family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria formed after the death of Ptolemy IV
 Additionally, as Rome relied more heavily on Egypt for grain imports, the Romans took considerable interest in Egypt's political situation
 Continuing Egyptian revolts, ambitious leaders, and powerful Syrian opponents unbalanced this situation, resulting in Rome being forced to send forces to make this country a province of its empire

 However, it was an anti-religion whose tendency was to win converts to paganism and it challenged popular religious traditions
 This resulted in the persecution of converts to Christianity, which culminated in the great march of Diocletian in 303 AD, but Christianity eventually prospered
 In 391 AD, the Christian emperor Theodosius introduced a bill which prohibited pagan rites and closed temples
 Alexandria became the center of great anti-pagan riots where public and private religious symbols were destroyed
 As a result, the Egyptian pagan culture continued to decline
