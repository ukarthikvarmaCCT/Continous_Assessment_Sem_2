 Radhakrishnan, the then Professor of Philosophy Department, was greatly overwhelmed by the philosophy of classical knowledge
 unhone unhen darshan shaastra kii kakshaon se anupasthit rahane kii anumati pradaan kar di
 But instead, it was conditioned that he should teach in philosophy classes instead
 tab radhakrishna ne apane kaksha saathiyon ko teraa aise prabhaavshaalee vyaakhyaan diye, jinase ve shikshaarthi bhi chakit rah gayi
 The reason for this was that he had a deep grip on the subject, his approach to philosophy was clear and he had also chosen the appropriate words while giving lectures
 1912 main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan kii "manovigyaan ke aavashyak tatv" sheershak se ek laghu pustika bhi prakashit hui jo kaksha main diye gayi unke vyakhyanon kaa sangrah tha
 This qualification was proved by this booklet that "not only do they have a rich store of words to explain every verse, their memory power is also very unique
 " When Dr
 Radhakrishnan returned to India from Europe and America, then various universities here honored him by awarding him honorary degrees
 1928 kii sheet ritu main inaki pratham mulaaqaat pandit jawahar laal nehru se us samay hui, jab vah congress party ke vaarshik adhiveshan main sammilit hone ke liye kalakatta aae hue the
 Although Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan could not participate in any political discourse as a member of the Indian Educational Service, he did not care for this taboo and gave a speech
 1929 main inhen vyaakhyaan dene hetu 'maanchester vishvavidhyalay' dwaara aamantrit kiya gaya
 He gave many lectures in Manchester and London
 inaki shiksha sambandhi uplabdhiyon ke daayre main nimnavat sansthanik seva kaaryon ko dekha jaataa he- Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did the same and put his address to rest at 12 o'clock at night
 pandit nehru or radhakrishnan ke alaava kisi anya ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi
 After independence, he was requested to fulfill diplomatic work with the Soviet Union as a distinguished ambassador to serve the motherland
 is prakaar vijayalakshmi pandit kaa inhen nayaa uttaradhikari chunaa gaya
 Pandit Nehru's selection prompted many to wonder why a philosopher was chosen for diplomatic services? He suspected that the abilities of Dr
 Radhakrishnan were not compatible with the responsibility assigned to him
 lekin baad main sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah sabit kar diya ki moscow main niyukt bhartiya rajanyikon main ve sabase behatar the
 He was a non-traditional diplomat
 jo mantranaayen der raatri hoti thim, ve unamem raatri 10 baje tak hi bhaag lete the, kyonki uske baad unke shayan kaa samay ho jaataa tha
 Even when Radhakrishnan was a teacher, he was not bound by rules
 kaksha main yah 20 minute deree se aate the or das minute purv hi chale jate the
 They said that the lectures they had to give in class were completed in enough time of 20 minutes
 iske uparant bhi yah vidhyaarthiyon ke priy evam aadarneey shikshak bane rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was elected Vice President after his arrival from the Soviet Union in 1952
 samvidhan ke antargat uparashtrapati kaa nayaa pad srujit kiya gaya tha
 Nehru again surprised the people by choosing Radhakrishnan for this post
 unhen aashcharya tha ki is pad ke liye congress party ke kisi raajnneetijna kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Radhakrishnan also served as the Speaker in the Rajya Sabha as Vice President
 san 1952 main ve bharat ke uparashtrapati banaaye gayi
 Later this selection of Pandit Nehru also proved to be meaningful, because a non-politician as Vice President influenced all politicians
 sansad ke sabhi sadasyon ne unhen unke kaary vyavhaar ke liye kaafii saraahaa
 People still remember his generosity, perseverance and humorous nature
 hamaare desh ke dwitiya kintu adwitiya raashtrapati dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ke janm din ko prativarsh 'shikshak diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, awards are also given to the best teachers in the entire country by the Government of India
 yadhyapi unhen 1931 main british samrajya dwaara "sar" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gayi thi lekin swatantrata prapti ke pashchaat uskaa auchity dow radhakrishnan ke liye samaapt ho chukaa tha
 When he became the vice-president, the first President of independent India, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad ji, in 1954 gave him the country's highest decoration Bharat Ratna for his great philosophical and educational achievements

Without daughter, whom will you marry? Who will not be a sister, will not be a tilak, whose hero will be called? In India, it is a custom to worship child girls during the Navratri festival

 In places like Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, people commit female feticide to save dignity and dowry, in the cities of India, daughters are strangled in the desire of sons and its consequences are in front of everyone today
 lanset patrika main chape ek adhyayan ke nishkarshon ke anusaar varsh 1980 se 2010 ke bich is tarah ke garbhpaaton kii sankhya 42 lakh se ek karod 21 lakh ke bich rahi he
 Girls are the basis of society
 yahi maa, bahan, beti or bahu kaa kirdaar nibhaati hai
 But in many parts of society, these girls are killed before they are born - to raise them, give them dowry and save their honor when they grow up
 aaj 21veen sadi main yah tark hamaari pragatisheel soch par ek kaale kalank kii tarah hai lekin yah puri tarah sach he
 Also, the Center for Social Research estimates that in the last 20 years more than one crore girls were not born in India due to female feticide
 varsh 2001 kii janaganana kahati he ki dilli main har ek hajaar purushon par mahilaon kii sankhya 865 thi
 At the same time, there were 784 females to one thousand males in Ambala, Haryana and 770 females to one thousand males in Kurukshetra
 puure vishwa main bal kanyaon or kanya bhrun hatyaon kii badhati sankhya dekhte hue sanyukt raashtra ne 11 oktober ko vishwa bal kanya diwas ke rup main manaane kaa nirnay kiya he
 This day there is discussion and necessary steps are taken to prevent child girls and female feticide
 kya sirf charchaa se rukegaa yah paapakanya bhrun hatya ko paap kahana galat nahin hoga
 In India, there is a provision of punishment in the law to stop this sin, but it is very shameful that today this law is being badly denied
 kanya bhrun hatya ko rokane ke liye sirf kanoon bana dene se kya hota he? kanoon ke anupaalan ke liye ek mashinari bhi to honi chahie
 At the same time, the biggest culprit of the increasing cases of female feticide is the division of Indian society where there is a difference of ground and sky between men and women
 aisa ho to shaayad ruk jaae kanyaon kii hatyakanya bhrun hatya jatil masalaa he
 Actually, the most important thing for this is the awareness of women, because the decision has to be taken by the woman
 duusari pareshaani kanoon-vyavastha ke str par he
 Knowing that sex testing of the fetus is a crime, there are clinics running in the streets that are notorious for sex tests and abortions

 It is very difficult to deal with this problem in India, but if women decide, then it is not impossible

 mahila shashaktikaran kii disha main haalanki duniya ke kai desh kai mahatvapurn upaay kanphi pehle kar chuke hai
 Surprisingly, in our neighboring country Pakistan, reservation for women in parliamentary seats has already been arranged
 lagata to he ki ab bharatvarsh main bhi is disha main kuch rachanaatmak kadam uthaae jane kii taiyaari shuru kar di gai he
 The reservation of women in a male dominated society and that too in an area like politics where the dominance of men is generally seen, is indeed a surprise
 parantu purv pradhanmantri swargeey rajeev gandhi ke is sapane ko saakaar karne kaa jis prakaar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne man banaaya he tathaa apane congress saansadon ko mahila aarakshan ke paksh main matdaan karne kii anivaaryta sunishchit karne hetu vip jari kiya he use dekhakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki congress party ke sheersh purush netaa bhale hi bheetar hi bheetar is bill ke virdohi kyon na hon parantu sonia gandhi kii manshaa bhaanpane ke baad philhal aisa nahin lagata ki congress kaa koi netaa rajyasabha main is vidheyak ke paarit ho jane ke baad ab loksabhaa main iske virudhd apni jubaan khol sakegaa
 When it comes to reservation of half the population of the country, the Bharatiya Janata Party cannot keep itself apart from the Women's Reservation Bill, despite having a million differences with the Congress, so despite the differences with many mps in the party, the BJP is still standing in favor of this bill
 Is visible haalanki isamen bhi koi do raay nahin he ki jis prakaar manmohan singh kii pichhali sarkaar ke samay bharat america ke madhya hua parmaanu qaraar manmohan sarkaar ke liye ek badi musiibat sabit hua tha tathaa usee mudde par vampanthi dalon ne you pi e sarkaar se apana samarthan tak waapas le liya tha
 The exact same situation is being seen once again regarding the Women's Reservation Bill
 parantu pichhali baar kii hi tarah is baar bhi congress ke iraade bilkul sanf hai
 It is reported that a senior Union Minister asked Sonia Gandhi whether she would like approval for women's reservation in the Lok Sabha or she would like to save the government
 is par sonia gandhi ne bhi spasht kar diya he ki unhen mahila aarakshan kii manjuuri chahie
 The whole country and the world is watching what happened in the Parliament of the country in the past
 raisabha ke 7 saansadon ko sabhapati kii mo par chadhane tathaa vidheyak kii prati faadane va sadan kii garima ko aghat pahunchane ke jurm main sadan se nilambit tak hona padaa tha
 The ruckus being created by these mps of Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party and Lok Janshakti Party about the present form of the Women's Reservation Bill is also ridiculous
 in dalon ke netaa yah maang kar rahe hai ki 33 pratishat mahila aarakshan ke cote main hi daliton, pichhadi jatiyon tathaa alpsankhyakon kii mahilaon hetu aarakshan kiya janaa chahie
 Now this shagufa is just shagufa or there is a doubt in this step of these parties, to know that it would be wise to look in the past also
 mahilaon ke 33 pratishat saamaanya aarakshan kii vakaalat karne vaale lalu yadav, mulaayam singh yadav, sharad yadav tathaa ramvilas paswan jaise vidheyak ke vartmaan swaroop ke virodhiyon se jab yah poochhate hai ki aap log apni- apni partiyon ke rajnatik astitv main aane ke baad se lekar ab tak ke kinhin paanch aise saansadon, vidhayakon yaa vidhaan parishad sadasyon ke naam bataaen jinhen aap logon ne dalit, pichhadaa tathaa alpsankhyak hone ke naate party pratyaashee ke rup main kisi sadan kaa sadsy banwaaya ho
 In response, these leaders have nothing to say
 isi se yah sanf zaahir hota he ki daliton, pichhadi jatiyon tathaa alpsankhyak samudaay kii mahilaon ke naam par kiya jane vaala inkaa hangaamaa keval hangaamaa hi he hakeekat nahin
 In fact, the compulsion of the leaders who are opposing the Women's Reservation Bill on the basis of caste is that the hands of the backward castes and minorities from their votes are slipping away from the vote bank which used to be instrumental in bringing them to power
 lihaaja yah netaa pichhadon va alpsankhyakon kii mahilaon ko atirikt aarakshan die jane ke naam par mahila aarakshan vidheyak kaa jo virodh kar rahe hai vah vastav main ek tir se do shikaar khilne jaisaa hi he
 While raising their voice in favor of these castes, this leader is trying to save his slipping mass base again, while his efforts are not to pass the bill due to their opposition and uproar
 or is prakaar raajnneeti main purushon kaa varchasv purvawat bana rahe
 There are many other facts related to the Women's Reservation Bill which we cannot ignore
 haalanki mahilaon dwaara aamtaur par is vishay par kushi kaa izhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The news of reservation has excited most of the women of the country
 parantu inhen main kuch shikshit va sudhi mahilaayein aisi bhi hai jo mahila aarakshan ko gair jaruri or shoshebaaji maatr bataa rahi hai
 Such women argue that reservation for women empowerment is not just reservation
 iske atirikt or bhi tamaam upaay aise ho sakate hai jinase ki mahilaon ko purushon ke samakaksh laayaa ja saktaa he
 For example, provision of free compulsory education should be made for women
 mahilaon par hone vaale yon utpeedan sambandhi aparaadh tathaa dahej sambandhi aparaadhon main avilamb evam nyaaysangat faisle yathashighra aane chahien tathaa iske liye or sakht kanoon bhi banaae jane chahie
 Female feticide should be banned all over the country immediately and more stringent laws also need to be enacted for this
 khelkud main mahilaon hetu purushon ke baraabar kii vyavastha kii jaani chahie
 Women should also be given reservation in government and non-government jobs
 or yah aarakshan chunki desh kii aadhi aabaadi ke liye diya janaa he at: ise 33 pratishat nahin balki 50 pratishat kiya janaa chahie
 There should be a system of helping and giving shelter to the elderly, sick and victims of domestic violence
 vyavsaay hetu mahilaon ko praathamikta ke aadhaar par bank lone muhaiyaa karaae jane chahie
 Therefore, after learning from a village industry organization like Papad, the government should also run many similar women-oriented establishments at the national level
 rahaa sawaal mahilaon kii satta main bhagidaari hetu sansad main mahila aarakshan vidheyak prastut kiye jane kaa to isamen bhi shaq nahin ki raajnneeti main mahilaon kii arakshit bhagidaari nishchit rup se raajnneeti main faile bhrashtachar main kami laa sakegi
 The nuisance scenes commonly seen in Parliament and Legislatures are also likely to decrease by about 33 percent
 sansad main note ke bandal bhi pehle se kam uchhaale jaaenge
 But all this will be possible only when the said bill can be introduced in the Lok Sabha of the country and after that the Lok Sabha should pass this bill with two-thirds of the votes
 or chunki yah samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak he isliye desh kii aadhi se adhik arthath lagbhag 15 vidhansabhaon main bhi is vidheyak kaa paarit hona jaruri hoga
 Since the matter is being talked about empowerment of women in India, it is necessary to mention here some things related to the past related to some women related to the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, which are most visible in favor of women reservation
 It will feel bad, but who can deny the truth that history has recorded on the inscription of the time
 yaad kiijie jab ek mahila arthath sonia gandhi bharat kii pradhanmantri banane ke kareeb thi us samay sushamaa swaraj va uma bharti ke kya vaktavy the
 At that time, these women eyes were seen talking about shaving their hair, eating barley gram and vomiting cots in the house in protest against Sonia Gandhi
 aaj bhaajapa va congress mahila aarakshan ke paksh main lagbhag ekajute dikhaai pad rahe hai
 Both these parties should not forget those days when tearing the belly of so many women during the anti-sikh riots of Delhi and during the anti-muslim riots in Gujarat under the protection of Narendra Modi's government Was put into anek mahilaon ko jivit agni ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 Many breasts were cut with swords
 bade afsos kii baat he ki mahilaon par yah atyaachaar bhi inhen raajnneeti ke visheshgyon ke ishaare par kiya gaya tha jo aaj mahila shashaktikaran kii baaten kar rahe hai
 And that's why, seeing this unbelievable bill, it is bound to doubt how much reality is there and how much to harvest
 'beti bachaao'hamaara des or samaaj kaaphi pragati kar gaya he or aage kar bhi rahaa he lekin abhi bhi striyo ko jitna sammaan milanaa chahie utana nahi miltaa he kyoki unhen itnaa mahatvapurn nahi samajha jaataa he or isi liye garbh main hi unki hatya kar di jaati he ling parikshan karavaake lekin aisa nahi karnaa chahie, yadi aap aisa sochate he kii betaa hoga to vah adhik kaam kaa hoga to bahut hi galat sochate he, betaa ho yaa beti bhagwaan kii ichha samaj ke use hi sweekaar kar lenaa chahie, kyoki pahele se hi kisi baat kaa andaja laga lenaa bahut uchit nahi kaha ja saktaa he, isi se sambandhit main ek prerak prasang prastut kar rahaa hoon jisase aap ko aisa lage kii koi kisi se kam nahi bas aapane parvaris kaise kii he, dekhbhaal kaise kii he, sabakuch is par aadhaar rakhata he
 In the active politics of our country, a family is still actively involved, which is known as the Gandhi Nehru family, now you must have understood where my point is, Jawaharlal Nehru is the first Prime Minister of Hare Des , His father's name was Motilal Nehru who was a barrister
 jawahar laal nehru kii ek hi santan thi jo kii putree thi lekin hamen itihaas main kahi bhi aisa nahi pataa chalata he kii jawahar laal nehru ko kabhi bhi is baat se koi samasya rahi ho kii koi betaa kyo nahi hua kya wo chaahate to koi betaa god nahi le sakate the yaa phir koi duusari shaadi nahi kar sakate the lekin unhone aisa nahi kiya bhagwan ne unhen jo diya is maamle main yahi kahoonga kii unhone use hi sweekaar kar liya, vaise to ab aap samaj hi gaye honge kii main kiski baat kar rahaa hoon lekin phir bhi naam bataa hi don, to jawahar laal nehru ko ek hi putree ratna kii prapti hui thi jinka naam indira gandhi tha, ab main yah vichaar karata hoon kii yadi jawahar ji ko putree kii jagah koi putr praapt hua hota to kya vah indira ganghi ke jitna naam kar paata yaa phir itani nidaarat se faisle le paata




 That is why i believe that if you teach your children properly and introduce them to the world properly, they understand their problems and solve them, and if you do not see the daughter with a narrow twist, then in your life you will never Also, it will not look like we do not have a son, but you will not only see a difference between son and daughter, but your name will also be illuminated and this country too

 But for some time, it seems to be losing its originality
 jis aakraamakata ke liye wo jane jate the, us chhavi ke thik vipareet aaj wo samjhautavaadi nazar aate hai
 Advani, who heralded a new consciousness among Hindus, is looking for Advani of the nineties
 apni bayaanbazi kii vajah se unki kaaphi fazihat hui
 He also came into the discussion from his book and blog
 aalochana bhi hui

 aise adeshon ke kuch maanak nirdesh hote hai
 They are like this
 stop los kisi share yaa suchakank kaa vah mulya hota he, jis par pahunchane ke baad saude band kar diye jate hai
 In the financial market, there is also a possibility of the price of any share bought going up and there is a possibility of going down
 share kaa bhav yadi neeche girane lagata he to vah kaaphi neeche pahunch saktaa he
 Hence its stop loss is fixed only when purchasing shares
 udhaahrantah yadi sau rupe kaa share liya gaya he, to 95 yaa 90 rupe aane par bech diya jaae
 What price to keep, or sell, even when the price reaches below it; This is the stop loss
 anubhaviyon ke anusaar share kharidte samay hi stop los ke bare main tay kar lenaa adhik laabhprad rahata he
 This facility is available in the broker's computer
 safal evam anbhavi stock niveshak ritern kaa anumaan or stop los par sadaa hi griddha-drushti banaaye rakhte hai
 Stop loss is also called stop order
 kisi share ke badhate hue bhav ke aankadon kii sarini main jis sthaan par share-bhav trend line ko kaat kar neeche kii ore jaae, vahiin us share kaa stoplos hota he
 Similarly, where the price in recession deals cuts above the trend line, there is a stop loss of those deals
 jab stoplos ko bhav ke saath badhaayaa yaa ghataya jaataa he, to use trailing stoplos kehete hai
 There are several types: bazaar main chadhate hue share ke bhav kaa graph jahaan se neeche kii ore mudata he, us sthiti yaa sthaan ko top yaa sheersh kehete hai
 Similarly, from where the graph starts climbing in the falling house, it is called bottom
 takneekee vishleshan main top or bottm kaa bada mahatv hota he
 If every next top and bottom in a chart is higher than the previous top and bottom respectively, then the stock or index is said to be in a boom phase
 isi tarah kisi chart main har aglaa top or bottm kramash: pichley top or bottm se neeche ho, to share yaa suchakank mandi ke daur main mana jaataa he
 In the bar chart of the stock price, the line which is found when a stock is connected to the highest and lowest prices of each day on a straight line is called the trend line or trend line
 girte hue share kii trend line us share ke ucchtam bhav se line khinchate hai, jabaki chadhate hue share kii trend line khinchne ke liye nunatam bhav se line khinchi jaati he
 For better results, the line is drawn from the density areas of the highest or lowest prices of several days in place of the highest or lowest price of a single day
 vyapaar rekha niveshkon ke liye atyant sahaayak hoti he, jise angreji main trend ij da best friend bhi kehete hai
 a breakdown of the trend means that the direction of the stock move is about to change
 yani agar share bhav gir rahaa ho or ekaek share kii keemten upar se khinchi gai rujhaan rekha ko katkar upar kii ore aane lagen, to samajhnaa chahie ki badhat shuru hone vaali he
 Conversely, if the trend line drawn from the rising stock or the lower price of the index starts going above the prices, then the fast deals should be cut
 ritern par nazar rakhane or milane vaale kaa anumaan lagane se niveshak ko vittiya lakshyon kii jaankaree milane par laabh-vasuuli saral ho jaati he
 This makes the decision easier whether the investor is profitable to invest in a particular business
 visheshgyon ke anusaar yadi ritern - jokhim anupaat paksh main nahin he to vah kaarobaar nahin karnaa chaiye
 For example, if you buy a stock of Rs 90 with a target of Rs 100 and the stop loss is below Rs 75, then the return-risk ratio is not in favor
 is maamle main lakshya keemat par share bechney ke baad 10 rupye prati share ke pratyaashit laabh ke liye 15 rupye prati share kii haani nuksaan uthaane ko taiyaar hai
 This way the risk is higher than the returns and it is prudent not to invest in this stock
 is prakaar stop losd kii jaankaree nivesh karnaa tay karne main atyant sahaayak hoti he
 Most analysts feel that traders should fix a stop loss based on their risk appetite

 is lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue british sarkaar ne landan main gol mej sammelnon kaa aayojan shuru kiya
 Three round table conferences were organized by the British government under a series of conferences between 1930–32 to discuss constitutional reforms in India
 ye sammelan may 1930 main simon ayog dwaara prastut kii gayi report ke aadhaar par sanchalit kiye gaye the
 The demand for Swaraj, or self-governance, was increasing rapidly in India
 1930 ke dashak tak, kai british rajanetaaon kaa maananaa tha ki bharat main ab swa-shashan lagu hona chahie
 However, there were considerable ideological differences between the Indian and British political parties, which could not be resolved by the summons
 pehla gol mej sammelan navambar 1930 main yojit kiya gaya jisamen desh ke pramukh netaa shaamil nahin hue, isi kaaran antat: yah baithak nirarthak sabit hui
 It was officially launched by George v on 12 November 1930 and presided over by the British Prime Minister, Ramsay mcdonald

 Radical nationalists criticized the deal because Gandhiji could not obtain assurances of political freedom for Indians from the Viceroy
 gandhi ji ko is sambhavit lakshya kii prapti ke liye keval vaartaon kaa aashwaasan mila tha
 The idea of forming an All India Federation remained the main point of discussion
 sammelan main bhaag lene vaale sabhi samoohon ne is avadharana kaa samarthan kiya
 The responsibilities from the executive meeting to the assembly meeting were discussed and Ambedkar demanded a separate political representative for the untouchables
 yah vastav me dalito ke liye uphaar tha
 They too could not be viewed in this way
 doosraa gol mej sammelan 1931 ke aakhir main landan main yojit hua
 Mr
 Gandhi was leading the Congress in that
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki unki party puure bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 The claim was challenged by three parties
 muslim lig kaa kahana tha ki vah muslim alpsankhyakon ke hit main kaam karti he
 The princely states claimed that the Congress had no authority over the territory under their control
 teesri chunauti tej-tarraar vakil or vichaarak bi aar ambedkar kii taraf se thi jinka kahana tha ki gandhi ji or congress party nichali jatiyon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte
 This conference in London could not reach any conclusion, so Gandhiji had to return empty-handed
 bharat lautne par unhone savinay avagya andolan shuru kar diya
 The new Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, had absolutely no sympathy for Gandhiji
 apni bahan ko likhe ek nijee khat main wellingdon ne likhaa tha ki- However, in the new Government of India Act in 1935, the assurance of limited representative governance was expressed

 march 1940 main muslim lig ne pakistan ke naam se ek pruthak raashtra kii sthapana kaa prastaav paarit kiya or use apana lakshya ghoshit kar diya
 Now the political landscape had become quite complex: the struggle was no longer Indian versus British
 ab yah congress, muslim lig or british shashan, teen dhuriyon ke bich kaa sangharsh tha
 At the same time, an all-party government was in power in Britain, in which the Labor Party members were sympathetic towards Indian aspirations, but the head of the government was Prime Minister Winston Churchill Cutter
 unka kahana tha ki unhen samraat kaa sarvocch mantri isliye nahin niyukt kiya gaya he ki vah british samrajya ko tukade-tukade kar den
 In the spring of 1942, Churchill sent one of his ministers, Sir Stafford Cripps, to India to find a way out of the agreement with Gandhiji and the Congress
 krips ke saath vaarta main congress ne is baat par jor diya ki agar dhuree shaktiyon se bharat kii raksha ke liye british shashan congress kaa samarthan chahta he to vysarai ko sabase pehle apni kaaryakari parishad main kisi bhartiya ko ek raksha sadsy ke rup main niyukt karnaa chahie

 After the 1700th century, as the Industrial Revolution grew at a rapid pace, there was also a considerable increase in population growth
 The rate of population growth in the last 50 years has been even faster and the main reason for this is the growth in the medical world and the significant increase in agricultural productivity, especially the progress made due to the Green Revolution between 1960 and 1995
 In 2007, the United Nations Population Division estimated that in the year 2055 the world population would cross the figure of 10 billion
 In the future, it is expected that the increase in the world's population will reach the peak and after that the population will start to decrease due to economic reasons, health concerns, indiscriminate use and depletion of land and environmental hazards
 There is also an 85% possibility that the world's population will stop increasing before the end of this century
 There is a 60% probability that the world's population will not exceed 10 billion people before the year 2100 and there is a 15% probability that the world's population will be less than the total population of the world at the end of the century
 For different regions, there will be considerable variation in the date and size of the largest population

 This would be useful if fertility control is seen as a personal decision of the individual and population control is seen as a government or state level regulation policy of population growth
 Fertility control is likely to occur when a person or couple or family takes steps to reduce or control their childbirth
 In the formulation given by Ansley Cole, three prerequisites have been given for continued reduction in reproduction: acceptance of choice calculated as a valid element of reproduction, known benefits from reduced reproduction and knowledge of effective methods of control and their use
 Skilled practice of doing
 Unlike societies that believe in natural reproduction, societies that wish to limit reproduction and have the resources available to do so
 wo in sansadhano kaa prayog bacchon ke janm main vilamb, bacchon ke janm ke bich antar rakhane, yaa unke janm ko rokane ke liye kar sakate hai
 Delay in sexual intercourse, or the adoption of a natural or artificial method of contraception is in most cases a personal or family decision, it has nothing to do with state policy or social approval

 At the social level, declining fertility is an inevitable consequence of the increasing secular education of women
 haalaanki, yah zaruri nahin he ki madhyam se ucch str tak ke prajnan niyantran main prajnan dar ko kam karnaa shaamil ho
 Even when comparing different societies which have adopted fertility control quite well, societies with equal fertility control ability can also give very different reproductive levels, which is related to the fact that small Or what is a personal and cultural choice for a large family or for the number of children

 It is also necessary to adopt policies that increase population as an aspect of population control and it is important to understand that the government does not want to stop population growth only as a form of population control
 To encourage population growth, the government can not only support immigration but also create additional children by pro-birth policies such as tax benefits, financial rewards, continuation of pay during holidays and helping to care for children

 Surah Mohsin has translated this sura into English: al-iftiyaarishwar ke naam par, jo dayavan he:- When Jannat breaks into pieces; When stars fall apart and disintegrate; And when the seas burst forth; And when the graves are overturned, the inner ones come out; Then a person comes to know what has been sent with him and what is left behind, o man! What is it that has made you careless to that generous God of yours? Who saved you, gave you this perfect figure and gave you your authorized share; In whatever form He willed, He put you together
 Nay! But you deny the ad-din
 But verily, over you to watch you, Kirâman Kâtibîn writing down, They know all that you do
 Verily, the Abrâr will be in Delight ; And verily, the Fujjâr will be in the blazing Fire, Therein they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense, And they will not be absent therefrom
 And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? the Day when no person shall have power anything for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be with Allâh

 khagoleey photography kii prakriya saamaanya photography se bahut kuch bhinn hoti he, kyonki ise kuch aisi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karnaa padataa he jo saamaanya photography dwaara nahin ho saktin
 Some of these are: akashiya pindon kii duuri bahut hi vishaal hoti he or prithvi ke samipsth taron ko chhodkar shesh kori aankhon se nahin dikhalaai padate
 For this reason images of those stars cannot be captured with normal cameras
 bahut se taare hamase aparimit duuri par hone ke kaaran paraspar atyant paas paas athwa sate sate se dikhalaai padate hai, yadhyapi unke bich kii duuri arabon, kharbon mile se bhi kahin adhik hoti he
 Apart from this, an excessive number of bimetallic or coupler stars have fallen in the sky
 saamaanya camere se unhen pruthak kar sakna sambhav nahin hota, kyonki in camaron ke lenson kii vibhedankshmata atyant simit hoti he
 Due to the retardation of distant wires, long-term exposures have to be given, sometimes lasting several hours
 prithvi ke dainik ghurnan ke kaaran akashiya pind purv se pashchim kii ore chalate hue dikhalaai padate hai
 Therefore, to take a photograph of them, it is necessary that the camera's viewer also rotates in the same direction at the same speed
 in samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke hetu khagoleey photography main vyavahrut honevaale camere main ek doordarshee laga hota he, jo akashiya pindon se aanevaali prakashrashmiyon ko photopattica par abhisruth karata he
 This photo plate is placed at the location of the telescope's eyeballs and at the focus-plane of the viewer
 aise doordarshee ke liye abhidrishy kaa chayan purty uddeshy ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya jaataa he
 Due to the faintness of the inert objects, a fast camera is used

 Higher resolution of the image requires more nuclear-oriented viewpoints
 is kaaran camere kii kshiprata evam doordarshee ke aakaar main uchit sanupatik sambandh ko dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 To measure the positions and speeds of stars, a long atomizer or astrophysicist is used, which can produce fine images

 In addition, the image produced by the lens is not flat at all, ie, the plate is flat but its intensity is highest at the center of the field of view and decreases with rapid speed beyond it
 khagoleey photography main yah vipathan gambhir truti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 To avoid all these difficulties, the camera with an objective is called a wide field camera

 in camaron kaa drushtikshetra 600 yaa isse bhi kuch adhik hota he or inase ek saath hi akaash ke kaaphi vistrut bhaag kaa paryvekshan kiya ja saktaa he
 The best practical form of the Schmidt system is the Baker-nun camera, designed to depict the creations of artificial planets, satellites and meteors
 isamen prakaash ekatra karne kii kshamta bahut adhik hoti he, jiske kaaran atyant alpaavadhik udbhasana se lagbhag 55 drushtikshetra kaa atyant spasht chitra praapt hota he
 To take pictures of celestial objects that appear to be moving due to the rotation of the Earth, the camera's telescope is charged so that it moves in the case of the virtual motion of the objects with the help of an aerial device, so that the rays coming from the object during the time of exposure on the photo Keep falling on the image itself and thus the object remains on the plaque
 iske liye camere ko ek vishesh vidhi se aropit kar dete hai jise vishuvat aropan kehete hai
 It has two mutually perpendicular rotations - one parallel to the axis of the Earth, which is called the polar axis and the other its longitudinal axis
 sarvapratham doordarshee ko kisi vidyunmotor dwaara khagoleey vishuvat vrutt ke uttar yaa dakshin kii ore lakshya taare ke dik paat ke baraabar ghumaate hai or kranti kone yantra ko is prakaar clamp main kas dete hai ki vah uttar yaa dakshin kii ore hat bad na sake
 For this reason, the telescope can only move parallel to the equinox
 yahi vah rekha hogi jisapar vah tara chalata hua abhasith hoga
 The camera-connected camera rotates the telescope around the polar axis in such a way that one of its rounds is completed in one sidereal day
 chunki prithvi ke ghurnan ke kaaran akashiya pind purv se pashchim kii ore gatiman prathit hote hai, isaliye doordarshee kii bhi gati usee disha main hoti he
 By reading the rotation of the telescope on a calibrated circle adjacent to the polar axis, it can be determined from which direction the telescope is pointing at any moment in the sky
 itani sari vyavastha karne par bhi ek atyant mahatvapurn samasya kaa samaadhaan shesh rah jaataa he
 As a star falls towards the horizon, its rays of light have to cross more and more atmospheric distance to reach the telescope
 chitra 3
 main dekhne se yah spasht hoga ki jab koi tara t1 sthiti main hota he to prithvi tal par da sthaan par sthit doordarshee tak uski prakashrashmiyaan vaayu main a da duuri paar karke pahunchati hai, kintu jab vah tara t2 sthiti main aata he to prakashrashmiyon ko vaayu main ba da duuri paar kerani padati he, jo apekshaakrit adhik he
 Therefore, the amount of rotation in the rays of light by air varies continuously
 is kaaran kirnon ke pathvichlan ke liye sanshodhan karne kii koi yantric athwa swachaalit vyavastha sambhav nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, the observer has to look at the star with another telescope and with his help, the camera's telescope is rotated by hand so that the rays continue to collect in place of the image on the photo plate

 kisi vishay ke sambandh main manushyon ke kaaryo ke krambaddh gyaan ko us vishay kaa shaastra kehete hai, isliye arthshaastra main manushyon ke arthsambandhi kaayon kaa krambaddh gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Economics is also used to understand how the economy works and how the economic relationship of different sections in the society is
 arthshaastreey vivechna kaa prayog samaaj se sambandhit vibhinn kshetron main kiya jaataa he, jaise:- aparaadh, shiksha, parivaar, swasthya, kanoon, raajnneeti, dharm, saamaajik santhaan or yuddh ityadi
 Pro
 According to Samuelsson, british arthshaastri alfred marshall ne is vishay ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘manushya jati ke rosemara ke jivan kaa adhyayan’ bataaya he
 Marshall had found that whatever is happening in society, economic powers are behind it
 isiilie saamaj ko samajhane or ise behatar banane ke liye hamen iske arthik aadhaar ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 According to Lionel Robinson the definition of modern economics is as follows- durlabhta kaa arth he ki uplabdh sansaadhan sabhi maangon or zaruraton ko puraa karne main asamarth hai
 Economics is of relevance due to rarity and alternative uses of resources
 atev yah vishay prerakon or sansadhano ke prabhaav main vikalp kaa adhyayan karata he
 In economics, it is natural for economic matters to be predominant
 parantu hamako yah na bhul janaa chahie ki gyaan kaa uddeshy arth praapt karnaa hi nahin he, satya kii khoj dwaara vishwa ke liye kalyaan, sukh or shanti praapt karnaa bhi he
 Economics also tells how happiness and peace can be achieved in the world by the economic efforts of humans
 sab shastron ke samaan arthshaastra kaa uddeshy bhi vishwakalyaan he
 The view of economics is international, although it also takes into account personal and national interests
 yah sambhav he ki is shaastra kaa adhyayan kar kuch vyakti yaa raashtra dhanwaan ho jaaen or adhik dhanwaan hone kii chintaa main duusare vyakti yaa rashtron kaa shoshan karne lagen, jisase vishwa kii shanti bhang ho jaae
 But all these works related to their exploitation cannot be said to be appropriate or appropriate to economics, because economics can only support those works by which the growth of world welfare can be done
 is vivechan se spasht he ki arthshaastra kii saral paribhaasha is prakaar honi chahie-arthshaastra main munshyon ke arthsambandhi sab kaaryo kaa krambaddh adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 His mission is world welfare and his vision is international
 jisamen dhan sambandhit kriyaaon kaa aadhyayan kiya jaataa he, arthshaastra kehalaata he
 The content of economics is indicated by its definition
 arrathshaatra vah vigyaan he jo maanav ke swabhaavik vaikalpik upyog karne vaale sadhano ore unke prayog ke madhya sambandh kaa adhyayan karaata hai
 Economics has theoretical and practical importance
 arthshaastra par likhi gayi pratham pustak kautilya rachit arthshaastra he
 Economics is a very ancient discipline
 chaar upved ati pracheen kaal main banaae gaye the
 The Earth Veda is also considered to be a Upveda in these four Upvedas, but it is no longer available
 vishnupurana main bharat kii pracheen tathaa pradhan 18 vidyaon main arthshaastra bhi pariganit he
 Presumptive and Cautical economics are available at this time
 arthshaastra ke sarvapratham acharya brihaspati the
 His economics is obtained in the form of formulas, but it does not include everything related to economics
 kautilya kaa arthshaastra hi ek aisa granth he jo arthshaastra ke vishay par uplabdh krambaddh granth he, isliye iskaa mahatv sabase adhik he
 Acharya Kautilya is also famous by the name of Chanakya
 ye chandragupta maury ke mahaamantri the
 His book 'arthashastra' is often 2,300 years old in the opinion of the pundits
 acharya kautilya ke matanusaar arthshaastra kaa kshetra prithvi ko praapt karne or uski raksha karne ke upayon kaa vichaar karnaa he
 He has included many things in his economics from initiation of celibacy to conquering countries
 shaharon kaa basaanaa, guptcharon kaa prabandh, sena kii rachana, nyaayalayon kii sthapana, vivaah sambandhi niyam, daybhag, shutraon par chadhaai ke tareeke, kilabandi, sandhiyon ke bhed, vyuharachna ityadi baton kaa vistaarrup se vichaar acharya kautilya apane granth main karte hai
 Authentically, how many things in this book are outside the specified area in the modern period of economics
 usamen raajnneeti, dandniti, samajashaastra, nitishastra ityadi vishyon par bhi vichaar hua he
 The meaning of the four efforts in Indian culture is also included
 jain dharm main aparigrah kaa upadesh kiya gaya he
 Many ancient Sanskrit texts have praised or condemned wealth
 bhartruhari ne kaha he, 'survey guna kanchanam ashrayante' 
 Chanakyasutra says- arthshaastra kaa vartmaan rup main vikaas paashchaatya deshon main hua
 Adam Smith is considered the father of current economics
 aapane 'rashtron kii sampatti' naamak granth likhaa
 It was published in 1776 AD
 isamen unhone yah batalaaya he ki prayek desh ke arthshaastra kaa uddeshy us desh kii sampatti or shakti badhanaa he
 He was followed by Malthus, Ricardo, Mill, Jevons, Kaal Marx, Sizvik, Marshall, Walker, Taussig and Rabins, who wrote beautiful works on economics
 parantu arthshaastra ko ek nishchit rup dene kaa shrey profesar marshall ko praapt he, yadhyapi profesar robins kaa profesar marshall se arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main matbhed he
 Three parties certainly appear in Western economists regarding the field of economics
 pehla dal professor robins kaa he jo arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan maanakar yah sweekaar nahin karata ki arthshaastra main aisi baton par vichaar kiya jaae jinke dwaara aarthik sudhaaron ke liye maargdarshan ho
 The second team is of Professor Marshall, Professor Pigu, etc
, who accepts economics as a science, recognizes that the main subject of the study of economics is man and considered all the things which are needed for his economic growth
 It is necessary to go
 parantu is dal ke arthshaastri rajiniti se arthshaastra ko alag rakhana chaahate hai
 The third party belongs to socialists similar to Karl Marx, who considers man's labor as the only means of production and seeks the advancement of laborers by destroying capitalists and landlords
 vah mazdooron kaa raaj bhi chahta he
 There is a lot of difference in the three parties regarding the field of economics
 isliye is prashn par vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he: After World War II, Cold War broke out in USA and Soviet Union
 yah koi yuddh nahin tha parantu isse vishwa do bhaagon main bant gaya
 America, England, Germany, Australia, France, Canada, Spain were side by side during the Cold War
 ye sabhi desh loktantric the or yahan par khuli arthvyavastha kii niti ko apanaaya gaya
 People were open to trade
 share bazaar main paisa lagane kii chhot thi
 Many big companies were formed in these countries
 in companiyon main naye-naye anusandhan hue
 Universities, information technology, engineering industry, banks, etc
 have all grown rapidly
 ye sabhi desh duusare deshon se vyapaar ko badhaava dene kii niti ko sweekaarte the
 All these countries have progressed well since 1945
 duusari taraf rus, china, myanmar, purvi germany sahit kai or desh the jahaan par samaajwaad kii arth niti apanaayi gayi
 Most of the industries here had strict government control
 udyogon se hone vaale laabh par sarkaar kaa adhikaar rahata tha
 Generally these countries did very little trade with other democratic countries
 is tarah kii arth niti ke kaaran yahaan ke udyogon main adhik pratispardhaa nahin hoti thi
 Even ordinary people had no incentive to make profit
 in karanon se in deshon main aarthik vikaas bahut kam hua
 On 3 October-1990, East Germany and West Germany merged
 sanyukt germany ne pragatishilath pashchimi germany kii tarah khuli arthvyavastha or loktantr ko apanaaya
 This was followed by the fragmentation of Soviet Russia in 1991 and the birth of 15 countries including Russia
 rus ne bhi samaajwaad ko chhodkar khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 China did not abandon socialism completely, but adopted liberal policies from the late 1970s and made great progress in the next 3 years
 checkoslovakia bhi samaajawaadee desh tha
 It fragmented into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1-january-1993
 in deshon ne bhi samaajwaad chhod ke loktantr or khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 The concept of value is central in economics
 isko maapne kaa ek tarika vastu kaa bazaar bhav he
 Adam Smith defined labor as the main source of value
 "mulya ke shram siddhanth" ko karl marks sahit kai arthshaastriyon ne pratipaadit kiya he
 According to this theory, the value of a service or commodity is equal to the labor used in its production
 adhikansh logon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mulya vastu ke daam nirdhaarit karata he
 This labor theory of price is closely linked to the "production cost theory of value"
 maang aapurti kii sahaayta se purnatah pratispardhi bazaar main beche gayi vastuon keemat or maatra kii vivechna, vyakhya or purvanumaan lagaaya jaataa he
 It is one of the most fundamental forms of economics
 kramash: bade siddhanton or praroopon ke vikaas ke liye iskaa vishad rup se prayog hota he
 Demand is the quantity of a product in a fixed period that a consumer wants to buy at a fixed price and is able to buy
 maang ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or icchit maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 Supply is the quantity of goods that a producer or seller is ready to sell in the market at a given price in a given time
 aapurti ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or aapurti kii maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 According to Prof
 Rabins, economics is the science that studies the functions of human beings which are present as the intended object and its finite means, which are used in alternative or at least two ways
 arthshaastra kii is paribhaasha se nimnlikhit baaten spasht hoti hai- Man experiences happiness from the fulfillment of his desires
 isliye prayek manushya apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karnaa chahta he
 The means, liquids, etc
 he possesses for the fulfillment of desires are finite
 vyakti kitna bhi dhanwaan kyon na ho, uske dhan kii maatra avashya parimit rahati he; phir vah is parimit saadhan dravya kaa upyog kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, according to the appropriate definition, economics considers all the functions of human beings, which he does by finite means to satisfy his desires
 is prakaar uske upbhog sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Similarly, how the means of purchasing many items in the market of a human being is limited
 is parimit saadhan dwaara vah apni aavashyak vastuen kis prakaar kharidta he, vah koun si vastu kis dar se, kis pariman main, kharidta yaa bechata he, arthath vah vinium kis prakaar karata he, in sab baton kaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya jaataa he
 When man prepares an object, the means of preparing it remain finite and he can use those means in many ways
 isliye utpati sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona swaabhaavik he
 Man has many desires to use his time
 parantu samay hameshaa parimit rahata he or uskaa upyog kai tarah se kiya ja saktaa he
 Suppose a person is sleeping, worshiping or playing a game
 profesar robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar in kaaryon kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona chahie, kyonki jo samay sone main puja main yaa khel main lagaaya gaya he, vah anya kisi kaary main lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 In any work a human being does, there is a need for time, and the use of this finite means of time must be considered in economics
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha itani vyapak he ki iske anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa vivechan, chaahe vah dharmik, raajnneetik yaa saamaajik hi kyon na ho, arthshaastra ke andar aa jaataa he
 By accepting this definition, the explanation of the limitations of economics, politics, theology and sociology is not equal
 professor robins ke anuyaayiyon kaa mat he ki parimit sadhano ke anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa aarthik pahalu rahata he or isi pahalu par arthshaastra main vichaar kiya jaataa he
 They say, if a work is related to the state, then its aspect should be considered in political science and if that work is also related to religion, then that aspect should be considered in theology
 maan len, ek manushya chorbazar main ek vastu ko bahut adhik mulya main bech rahaa he
 Due to finite resources, the work that he is doing and what effect it has on the production or fulfillment of the object, will be considered in economics; What is the duty of the state in relation to the perpetrator will be considered in political science or politics
 yah kaary acha he yaa bura, iskaa vichaar samajashaastra, achaarshastra yaa dharamshastra main hoga
 And, the idea of how to prevent this may not be in any scripture
 kisi bhi kaary kaa keval ek hi pahalu se vichaar karnaa uske uchit adhyayan ke liye kahan tak uchit he, yah vichaarneey he
 The second note to Professor Robbins's definition of economics is that he considers economics only as science
 usamen keval aise niyamon kaa vivechan rahata he jo kisi samay main kaary kaaran kaa sambandh batalaate hai
 These serious questions cannot be considered in what kind of changes should happen in the circumstances and what are the ways of changing the circumstances, because all these works are outside the science
 maane len, kisi samay kisi desh main sharaab pinevaale vyaktiyon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 According to Professor Robbins's definition, the only consideration in economics will be how the increase in the number of drinkers will affect the price of alcohol, the drinkers and alcoholics themselves
 parantu unke arthshaastra main is prashn par vichaar karne ke liye gunjaaish nahin he ki sharaab pinaa acha he yaa bura or sharaab pine kii aadat sarkaar dwaara kaise band kii ja sakati he
 He lacks guidance in economics
 prayek shaastra main maargdarshan uskaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag mana jaataa he or isi bhaag kaa professor robins ke arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main abhaav he
 Due to this deficiency, the study of economics cannot be beneficial to the public
 samaajawaadee chaahate hai ki poonjipatiyon or jameendaaron kaa astitv na rahane paae, sarkaar mazdooron kii ho or desh kii aarthik dasha par sarkaar kaa purna niyantran ho
 They also consider these questions in their economics books about how a labor government should be established
 jameendaaron or poonjipatiyon kaa astitv kaise mitaayaa jaae
 What kind of organization of labor government and how their organization can be done world wide
 is prakaar samaajawaadee lekhak arthshaastra kaa kshetra itnaa vyapak bana dete hai ki usamen raajnneetishastra kii bahut si baaten aa jaati hai
 We should define the field of economics in such a way that it does not include the things of political science or any other scripture
 arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main professor marshall kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha par bhi vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he
 According to Professor Marshall, economics studies the ordinary work related to human life
 vah manushyon ke aise vyaktigat or samjik kaaryon kii jaanch karata he jinka ghanishtha sambandh unke kalyaan ke nimit bhautik saadhan praapt karne or unka upyog karne se rahata he
 Professor Marshall has increased the field of economics by placing the welfare of the municipality in the definition of economics
 parantu is arthshaastri ne bhi arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main apni pustak main kuch vichaar nahin kiya
 In the present day Western economists have increased the field of economics, but even today, they do not accept the idea of economics in the field of economics
 ab to arthshaastra ko kala kaa rup diya ja rahaa he
 Economic plans are discussed everywhere in the world
 aarthik yojana taiyaar karnaa ek kala he
 No plan can be prepared without a goal
 arthshaastra ko koi bhi sarvasafal nishchit dhyey na hone ke kaaran in yojana taiyaar karanevaalon kaa bhi koi ek dhyey nahin he
 Each scheme assumes a different goal
 arthshaastra main ab deshavaasiyon kii dasha sudhaarney ke tareekon par bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he, parantu is dasha sudhaarney kaa antim lakshya abhi tak nishchit nahin ho paaya he
 In the absence of a well-known goal, there has been so much difference among economists that one opinion of two economists on a subject is difficult
 is matbhinnata ke kaaran arthshaastra ke adhyayan main ek badi baadha upasthit ho gai he
 To overcome this hurdle, Western economists should think seriously about the objective of economics in their texts and should, as far as possible, make a well-known goal of economics early
 sansar main prayek vyakti adhik se adhik sukhi hona or du:kha se bachanaa chahta he
 He knows that happiness is attained when his desire is satisfied and when the desire is not fulfilled, then he experiences sorrow
 dhan dwaara icchit vastu praapt karne main sahaayta milti he
 Therefore, every person tries to get wealth
 vah samajhataa he ki sansar main dhan dwaara hi sukh kii prapti hoti he
 To get maximum happiness, he tries to get more and more wealth
 is dhan ko praapt karne kii chintaa main vah praaia: yah vichaar nahin karata ki dhan kis prakaar se praapt ho rahaa he
 The result of this is that money is also obtained by means of which others are exploited, others are hurt
 is prakaar dhan praapt karne ke anek udhaaharan die ja sakate hai
 The capitalist does not give fair wages to his laborers in the worry of getting more money
 isse mazdooron kii dasha bigadane lagati he
 The shopkeeper destroys the health of his customers by adulterating foods
 chorbazari dwaara anek saral vyakti thage jate hai, mahajan karjadaaron se atyadhik sood lekar or jameendaar kisaanon se atyadhik lagaan lekar asankhya vyaktya ke pariwaron ko barabaad kar dete hai
 It is the unwavering law of nature that what one sows has to be reaped
 dusron kaa shoshan kar yaa du:kha pahunchaakar dhan praapt karanevaale is niyam ko shaayad bhul jate hai
 The wealth that you get by hurting others, you only get sorrow in the end
 usase sukh kii aashaa karnaa vyarth he
 It is true that the desired things can be obtained from the wealth which is obtained by hurting others and by obtaining these things one can get happiness
 parantu yah sukh asthaayee he or ant main dukh kaa kaaran ho jaataa he
 There are many such things in the world, which brings immediate happiness by using it, but in the long run, they get sadness
 udaahranarth maadak vastuon ke seven se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, paratu jab unki aadat pad jaati he tab unka seven atyadhik maatra main hone lagata he, jiskaa swasthya par bura prabhaav padataa he
 This causes sadness in the end
 dusron ko haani pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt hota he vah nishchit rup se buree aadaton ko badhaata he or kuch samay tak asthaayee sukh dekar vah du:kha badhaane kaa saadhan ban jaataa he
 Money obtained by giving grief to others can never be a seeker of lasting happiness and peace
 sukh do prakaar ke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by hurting others
 inke udhaaharan upar die ja chuke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by making others happy
 ve manushya ke man main shanti utpann karte hai
 The happiness that comes from performing one's duty also gives peace, the labor that one has to do while performing duty, definitely brings some pain, but on completion of the work, that sorrow results in happiness and from that Peace arises in is prakaar kaa sukh bhavishya main du:kha kaa saadhan nahin hota ore is prakaar ke sukh ko anand kehete hai
 When pleasure is attained, then there is no more than just a trace of sorrow
 aisi dasha ko paramanand kehete hai
 Achieving ecstasy is the best goal of every person
 vahi aatmakalyaan kii charam seemaa he
 It is the welfare of every human being in this that he always tries to achieve ecstasy
 vah hameshaa aisa sukh praapt karata rahe jo bhavishya main du:kha kaa kaaran yaa saadhan na ban jaae or vah shanti or santosh kaa anubhav karne lage
 When we bring happiness to others through our efforts and become the means of their welfare, then according to the adamant law of nature, our welfare also starts to increase by these efforts
 aatmakalyaan praapt karne kaa saral upaay dusron ke kalyaan kaa saadhan bananaa he
 Similarly, not to hurt anyone through your actions is the simplest way to avoid your misery
 prayek vyakti ko yah acchhee tarah samaj lenaa chahie ki uskaa sachcha hitsaadhan dusron ke hitsaadhan yaa parmarth dwaara hi siddh ho saktaa he
 It is clear from this that the happiness of others ie Vishwakalyan is the only means of their lasting happiness and peace ie autobiography
 jab prayek vyakti apana kalyaan karne ke liye dusron ke kalyaan kaa hameshaa praytn karne lagegaa tab kisi bhi tarah se swaartho kaa virodh na hoga, sansar main sab prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho jayega or sarvatra sukh or shanti sthaayee rup se sthapit ho jaaegi
 It is necessary for autism that each person gives as much importance to the selfishness of others as he gives to his selfishness
 jaise vah apane sukhon ko badhaane kaa praytn karata he, vaise hi use dusron ke sukhon ko badhaane kaa bhi praytn karnaa chahie
 The result of this will be that such works will be stopped due to which the suffering of others increases
 isse vishwa ke jeevon main sukh kii nirantar vruddhi hone lagegi or vishwa kaa kalyaan badhate badhate charam seemaa tak pahunch jayega
 Without Vishwakalyan, no person can be autistic
 sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt ho saktaa he
 Autism is the best goal of every person and when economics studies the economic efforts of man, then his aim should also be autism
 parantu, jaisaa upar batalaaya ja chukaa he, sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the aim of economics should be world welfare
 ham yah pehle hi bataa chuke hai ki jab kisi ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Therefore, if there is no desire for anything, then there is no opportunity to get sorrow
 kuch sajjanon kaa mat he ki sampurna ichchhaaon kii nivruti dwaara du:kha kaa abhaav or sthaayee sukh tathaa shanti praapt ho sakati he
 Therefore, if seen from this point of view, then lack of all desires should be the aim of economics
 yah thik he ki abhyaas dwaara ichchhaaon kaa niyantran avashya kiya ja saktaa he, parantu aisi dasha praapt kar lenaa jab kisi bhi prakaar kii ichha utpann hi na hone paae, saadhaaran manushya main se ek ke liye bhi vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Astu, the goal of economics is to accept the lack of complete desires for the welfare of only a few people and the public will not benefit anything from it, so it will not be appropriate to accept this goal
 kuch vyakti maanavkalyaan hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey maanate hai
 They do not consider it necessary to take care of the interests of animals and animals
 ve shaayad yah maanate hai ki jeevajantuon or pashu pakshiyon ko ishwar ne manushya ke sukh ke liye hi utpann kiya he
 Therefore, if the desires of human beings can be fulfilled by hurting or killing them, then there should be no objection in making them sad
 kintu dharamshastra or mahatma gandhi kaa to yah mat he ki prayek vyakti ko aisa hi kaary karnaa chahie jisase 'saarvbhaum hit' arthath sab jeevadhariyon kaa hit ho, kisi kii bhi haani na hone paae
 When a person starts treating the interest of every living being as his own, only then he gets permanent happiness and peace
 mahatma gandhi ne is maarg ko 'sarvoday' naam diya he
 It is only through this Sarvodaya Path that every type of conflict in the world can be overcome, exploitation can end and world peace can be established
