 The city of Königuzburg is in Russia today and is now Kaliningrad Kaliningrad
 uski praarambhik shiksha apni mata kii dekharekh main hui thi, jo apane samay ke "pavitra maarg" naamak dharmik andolan se bahut prabhavit thi
 Therefore, at an early age, he was interested in righteous conduct, simple, well-organized and professional life
 16 varsh kii aayu main, "collegium fidericaanum" kii shiksha samaapt kar, vah konigsburg ke vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hua, jahaan chah varsh usne bhautikashastra, ganit, darshan evam dharamshastra kaa adhyayan kiya
 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"
 inamen se pratham prakaashan main usne rine dakarth tathaa gotfreed wilhelm libenits ke satta sambandhi vichaaron kaa tathaa duusare main newton tathaa libenits ke yantric evam prayojanatavaadi vichaaron kaa tathaa duusare main newton tathaa libenits ke yantric evam prayojanatavaadi vichaaron main samanvay karne kaa praytn kiya tha
 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree
 kintu uski vyaktigat samasyaon main koi parivartan na hua
 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work
 kaant ne, visham paristhitiyon ke baavjood, 1766 i
 tak vishvavidhyalay kii avaitnaik rup se seva kii
 In 1758 AD, he prayed for the post of chief teacher of logic and philosophy, but he failed
 1766 i
 main use adhyaapan ke saath-saath sahaayak pustkaalay prabandhak bhi niyukt kiya gaya or ab use das pound vaarshik vetan milane laga
 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas
 san 1770 i
 main prakashit laathini sthapanaalekh –"sansar kii samaj or buddhi ke aakaar evam siddhant" se uskaa chintan vyavasthit rup main viksit hota dikhaai detaa he
 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers
 granthon ke prakaashan se bhi koi badi dhanrashi nahin praapt hoti thi
 Kant earned only 30 pounds from his "critique of Pure Reason"
 kintu, bhautik sukhon kii aakanksha na kar, 1796 i
 tak vah sakriy rup se sansar ke gyaanakosh kii abhivruddhi ke nimitt praytn karata rahaa
 Out of these 26 years, Adi spent 12 years writing only one book "review of Pure Wisdom"
 ukt granth 1781 i
 main prakashit hua tha
 It is considered the best philosophical treatise in Kant's adult texts
 is kaal ke anya granth "prayek bhavi darshan kii bhoomika", "nitidarshan kii prishthbhumi", "prakritik vigyaan ke darshanik aadhaar", "vyaavhaarik buddhi kii samiksha", "nirnay kii samiksha", "keval buddhi dwaara simit dharm", tathaa "shaashvat shanti par" 
 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim
 He did not have the power to take care of his own house; He did not marry, but during the teaching period of 42 years, he made a good impression on his colleagues and students
 atev mitron evam shishyon se use apane jivan ke antim bhaag main kaaphi sahaayta evam sahanubhuti praapt hui
 After 1801 AD, he became very infirm, but in the last three years his disciple named Wesianski stayed together and cared for him
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is kaal ke likhe hue kaant ke saat granth uplabdh hai– "ethics", "naitik gun ke siddhant ke darshanik aadhaar", "the contradiction of the psyche powers, "vyaavhaarik drushti se nrishastra", "logic," Physical Geography "and" Pedagogy "

 Kant's personal life was gripped by adamant rules
 praat:kaal se sandhya tak uske sabhi kaam nishchit samay par hote the
 There were also rules for snack time
 paashchaatya darshanikon main se adhikansh bhramanshil rahe hai, kintu kaant apane nagar se jivan bhar main adhik se adhik saath mile gaya tha
 Yet his outlook was not narrow
 vah keval bauddhik chintak na tha, usne sucraat or pithagoras kii bhanti jivan main apane darshanik vichaaron ko sthaan diya tha
 a German poet named Hyne has spoken in praise of Kant's philosophical life that proves him eccentric, but his ideas have influenced the subsequent philosophy so much that Kant's scholar considers him the originator of a new era in philosophy

 George Berklee was an english-irish philosopher who gave the theory of 'immaterialism' which was later called subjective idealism
 barkali kaa janm 12 march 1685 ko dicert, philkaini main hua tha
 At the age of 11, he entered the Philkany School and after four years he went to Trinity College
 vahaan undergraduate, graduate, phelo or tutor rahe
 Moved to London in 1713
 vahaan swift, steel, edison or pope se unka parichay hua
 He spent eight years touring England and Europe

 In 1734, he accepted the bishop of Clone and continued philosophical thinking while staying in the same general position
 samay samay par unhone lekh or pustaken likhin or unhen prakashit karaayaa
 In old age Berklee moved to Oxford for rest and died there a few months later
 barkali ne apni mukhya rachanaayen jivan ke praarambhik kaal main hi kii thim
 'an Assay Towards a New Theory of Vision', 'treaties Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge', 'three Dialogues Between Hells and Filonas', 'de Motu' 'alsafrone' or 'maynut Philosopher' and the Serim: 'A Chain of Philosophical' Wrote texts called 'reflections'
 gyanamimasaa par vichaar karte hue barkali is nirnay par pahunche ki amoort pratyay kaa koi astitv nahin he
 Names are simply words that indicate the general qualities of the objects in the experience
 unke kisi vaastavik satta kaa bodh nahin hota he
 The knowledge that comes in our experience is special
 shabd to pratyayon ke pratik maatr hai
 It is of heavy origin to consider the word itself as a suffix
 barkali ke mat main amoort pratyay yaa saamaanya keval naam hai
 Berklee gave more light to the empiricism of his foregoing philosopher John Locke
 lock ne ek aise aadhaar kii satta maani thi jisamen bhautik vastuon ke gun avasthit rahete hai
 It is not directly experienced, yet it does exist
 barkali ne ise sweekaar nahin kiya
 Locke believed that the power of the original or main qualities is independent and different from the seer, so the fluid of those qualities must be out of the fluid
 barkali ne yukti dwaara praathmik or dwitiyak gunon ke bhed kaa khandan kiya or sabhi gunon ko manas-avlambit siddh karne kaa praytn kiya
 Therefore, they did not accept the independent existence of matter or thing
 barkali kaa yah kathan prasiddh he ki 'astitv kaa arth he pratiti kaa vishay hona
 'it is an object, it means that one sees, hears or experiences it in some other way
 jo vastu anubhav main nahin aati uski satta kaa koi pramaan nahin he
 If experience is tested then it will be known that our suffixes are subjects of experience

 In 2008 media reports and in 2009 the New England Journal of Medicine described the anecdotal case of an hiv-positive patient of Gero Hutter, a physician from Berlin
 marij, jise acut milogenus leukemia or echivi sankraman donon tha, eemel ke liye kiye gayi uske asthi-majja pratiropan ke baad kuch logon ne use “kaaryaatmak rup se upachaarit” qaraar diya
 The bone marrow donor was selected as homozygous for a CCR5-Δ32 mutation providing resistance to almost all strains

 Researchers cautioned that it was too early to consider this treatment as a potential treatment because of the anecdotal nature of the treatment, the risk of death associated with bone marrow transplantation and other concerns
 2010 main, yah kaha gaya ki binlek naamak ek rasayan echivi ke doharaav kaa ek prabhavi nishedhak he

 It is estimated that without treatment, the net median time of survival after infection with HIV is 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype, and based on studies, in places with limited resources where treatment is not available
 Among them, the median of survival rate after diagnosis of AIDS is between 6 and 9 months

 As new therapies continue to develop and HIV also continues to develop resistance against these treatments, changes in survival-related estimates are likely to continue

 In 1983, two preliminary research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luke Montagnier independently declared that a new retrovirus had been infecting AIDS patients and published their findings in the same edition of the journal Science
 gallo ne daawa kiya ki unke samooh dwaara aids ke ek marij ke sharir se ek vishaanu ko alag kiya he, jiskaa aakaar ascharyajanak rup se anya human tii-limphotropic virus ke samaan he, jise unke samooh ne hi sabase pahal alag kiya tha
 This new virus, separated from him by Gallo's group, was named HTLV-III
 usee samay, montagnier ke samooh ne gardan kii linfadenopathy main sujan) or shaareerik kamajori, aids ke do paaramparik lakshan, pradarshit kar rahe ek marij ke sharir se ek vishaanu ko alag kiya
 Opposing Gallo's group's report, Montagnier and his colleagues demonstrated that the basic proteins of the virus differed immunologically from the basic proteins of HTLV-I
 montagnier ke samooh ne unke dwaara alag kiye gayi is vishaanu ko linfadenopathy-associated virus naam diya
 It has been a subject of much debate as to who among Gallo or Montagnier should get more credit for the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS

 Harald Zur Hausen also shared the award for his discovery that the human papilloma virus is the cause of cervical cancer, but Gallo was released
 gallo ne kaha ki sah-praptakarta ke rup main unhen namit na kiya janaa “niraashajanak” he
 Montagnier said he was "surprised" that Gallo was not recognized by the Nobel committee: "it was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS and that Gallo had an important role in it
" mujhe robert gallo se puri hamadardi he

 These claims, known as AIDS rejectionism, have been investigated and debunked by the world's scientific community, although they have had a political impact, particularly in South Africa, where the government Officially propagating AIDS rejectionism was responsible for the country's ineffective response to the AIDS epidemic

 Of
