 Template: Sociology In sociology, social mobilization is a theoretical concept under which a society or social structure is seen as a "functional mobilization"
 is drushtikon se, adarshatah, saamaajik aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye, saamaajik visheshtaon, jaise kanoon, parivaar, aparaadh aadi, ke sambandhon kaa nirikshan samaaj ke anya lakshanon ke saath parsparik kriya ke dauraan kiya jaataa he
 All components of a society or social organization have a certain function that maintains the stability and harmony of that organization
 samaaj kaa ek sanghatan ke rup main pratidarsh yaa isaki avadharana kaa vikaas 19 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main francis samajashastri, emile durkem ke dwaara kiya gaya tha
 According to Durkheim, the more specific a organization or function of a society, the greater its development, the exact opposite will also be true
 Generally, culture, politics and economics are the three major activities of society
 saamaajik swasthya in teen gatividhiyon kii suvyavasthit parsparik kriya par nirbhar karata he
 Therefore, the "health" of social mobilization can be seen as a function of the interaction of culture, politics, and economics, which can be studied, modeled, and analyzed as a theory

 mare nadi lambaai ke hisaab se australia kii sabase badi nadi he
 This 2575 km long river originates from the Australian Alps
 Darling Fiberglass lamps and gas mantle light lamps, etc
, emit light due to the fact that at high temperatures the fluorescence in the fibers and mantle is produced
 par kuch anya vidhiyaan bhi hai jinase vastuen prakaash utsarjit kar sakati hai
 For example, some substances emit light due to invisible ultraviolet rays, invisible cathode rays, invisible x rays or invisible radioactive radiation
 kuch rasinic abhikriyaaon main bhi prakaash nikalataa he
 All these effects can be derived from many sources of primary stimulation for photosynthesis, such as light, mechanical stress, chemical reactions, heat, electrical energy, nuclear radiation, etc
 nabhikeey vikiran dwaara utsarjit sandipti padaartho main uttejan tathaa ynikaran kii kriya dwaara hoti he
 That is the property of a substance, due to which the substance absorbs the radiation emitted from other sources and emits immediately
 aise padaarth ko pratideept padaarth kehete hai jisase prakaash kaa utsarjan usee samay tak rahata he, athwa uttejk ke hataa lene ke 10-8 second ke andar tak rahata he
 a period of 10–8 seconds represents the lifetime of an acceptable or permissible transition of the excited state of an atom
 padaarth kaa vah gun he jiske kaaran padaarth se prakaash kaa utsarjan gyey ooshmaa ke bina hota he
 Such substances, which emit light after the excitatory radiation is eliminated, are called 'phosphorescent substances'
 sfuradipti vibhinn padaartho main bhinn bhinn kaal tak bani rah sakati he tathaa yah kaal microsecond se lekar kai ghanton tak kaa ho saktaa he
 Only short-lived phosphorescent materials are useful for nuclear calculators
 prakashasandipti ke vibhinn prakaaron ke naam hai : vidyutprakash sandipti yaa gasiy visarjan, Illumination, cathod prakashasandipti tathaa Chemical photosynthesis
 inke atirikt prakashasandipti ke anya rup hai : Photosynthesis occurs not only in gases, but also in solids and liquids
 ek pratideept nalee dwaara utsarjit prakaash in do prakaar ke prakaash sandipt prabhaavon kaa parinaam he : People have knowledge of phosphorescent substances long before the knowledge of fluorescent substances
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki pratidipti kaa pradarshan parabangnee kirnon kii jyoti ke bina sambhav nahin he, jab ki sfuradipti suryaprakash se bhi prerit ho sakati he
 It is said that in about 1000 AD a Japanese priest made a color by burning oyster peels with sulfur and made a picture of the bull with that color
 yah chitra din ke prakaash main adrishy rahata tha, par raat ke prakaash main chamakta tha
 The use of phosphorescent substances in Europe was initiated by Vicentius Cascariolus
 inhone barietiess ko carbon ke saath garam karke ek aisa padaarth taiyaar kiya tha jo andhere main chamakta tha
 In the texts of 18th and 19th centuries, the discussion of Sphuradiapta substances is found equal, but only towards the end of 19th century, attention was paid to study it seriously
 sfuradipti kaa ek vishesh gun yah he ki prakashutsarjan kaa kaal taap par nirbhar karata he
 If a plaque made of phosphorescent material is taken and placed in front of ultraviolet rays, so that after removing the source of the rays, it produces phosphorescence and then dipped in hot water, it will be seen that the intensity of light increases and Shortly thereafter, it decayed and ended
 par yadi us pattica ko taral vaayu ke taap par thandha karke parabangnee kirnon ke samaksh rakhaa jaay, to kirnon ke hataa lene ke pashchaat koi sfuradipti utpann na hogi, par ab yadi pattica ko taral vaayu ke taap se hataa liya jaay or use kamare ke taap par rakhaa jaay to vah dhire dhire prakaash nikaalane lagegi
 But the quality of fluorescence is completely different from this
 yah neeche taap par bhi vidyaman rahati he
 Fluorescence dissipates as heat increases
 kuch pratideept padaartho main saamaanya se neeche taap par bhi kshay hota he
 Some fluorescent substances also decay at temperatures below normal
 kuch pratideept padaarth hai, jo 4000 sein
 ke taap par bhi pratidipti kaa adhyayan wood ne sarvapratham kramash: 1904 or 1912 i
 main kiya tha
 The wavelength of radiation emitted in resonant fluorescence remains the same as the wavelength of absorbed radiation
 jab prakaash ko kisi gas dwaara paarit kiya jaataa he or nikalanevaali kirnon ko spectrumdarshi se dekha jaataa he tathaa kuch andhkarpurn yaa kaali lakeeren, jinakon avasorana rekhaayen kehete hai, dekhi jaati hai, par bahut baar ve agal bagal prakirnit ho jaati hai
 The wavelength of these scattering rays is different from the wavelength of excitatory rays
 1904 i
 main wood ne khoj nikaala ki sodium kaa vaashp sodium ke di-rekhaavaale tarangadairghy kaa hi avasorana kar letaa he
 And later re-emits it
 isi prakaar kaa adhyayan unhone 1912 i
 main paare ke sambandh main bhi kiya
 Dunoyer also studied sodium
 is prabhaav ko anunadiya pratidipti kehete hai
 The question arises that if the wavelengths of the emitted and absorbed rays are not the same, then what is the relation between them? Stokes formulated a rule in this regard known as 'stokes's law'
 stokes kaa niyam he ki utsarjit vikiran sadaa uttejk vikiran kii apeksha adhik lambey tarangadairghy kaa hota he
 Thus, the energy absorbed by the atom always appears to be higher than that of the expelled energy
 par baad ke adhyayan se siddh hua ki yah purnataya satya nahin he, arthath nishkasit urja avashoshit urja se adhik ho sakati he
 It may happen that one atom collides with another atom in the excited state and absorbs some energy
 is kaaran nishkasit kiran kaa tarangadairghy uttejk vikiran ke tarangadairghy kii tulana main kam hoga
 Many tests have been done to find out how the intensity of photosynthesis depends on the wavelength
 prayogon se gyaat hua hai ki prakashasandipti us dasha main tivratam hoti he jab uttejan kisi nishchit tarangadairghy dwaara hota he
 If the wavelength used is more or less, the intensity decreases
 aisi dasha main uttejan spectrum ek ulti ghanti kaa rup le letaa he 
 The same is true of the spectrum of photoresistance
 saadharantaya prakaash sandipti ke spectrum kaa ek nishchit tarangadairghy par ekashirsh hota he
 Sometimes more than one head has also been seen
 kabhi kabhi sandipti spectrum kii choti tarangvaali punch uttejan spectrum ke lambey tarangvaale chor ko adhik dhak leti he 
 It is not a general rule that the intensity of fluorescence depends on the excitation wavelength but not on their color
 tarangadairghy 'a' dwaara utpann pratidipti utsarjan isi kaaran se aanevaale tarangadairghy kii tulana main kam tarangadairghy kaa he
 In more appropriate terms, Stokes's law means that the emission spectrum has a longer wavelength than the gravitational absorption spectrum
 adhikansh dashaon main donon bilkul bhinn hote hai
 Many scientists have studied this subject very closely
 ganitiya drushti se bhi iskaa adhyayan hua he
 Some arrays have also been prepared in this regard, including fluorescence materials, such as anthracene crystals, transstilbene crystals, xylene solutions, polyvinyl toluene solutions, solstyrene, sodium iodide, lithium iodide, ether sulfide etc
 properties, density, maximum emission, decay etc
 The properties are described
 inamen kuch to carbonic yogicon ke crystal, kuch vilyan, kuch acarbonic padaarthon ke crystal or churna hai
 In addition to these, some other inert gases such as genon and solid liquids and gases are also being used as fluorescent substances
 ek achche pratideepak main nimnlikhit gun hona aavashyak he : aagat urja ko drishy prakaash main parinat karne kii ucch kshamta; apane swayan ke pratideept prakaash ke liye paardarshita, pratideept prakaash ke liye micro-second yaa usase bhi kam kaa kshaykaal tathaa pratidipti ke spectrum se uplabdh photo cathodon ke spectrumia gunon se mail khaanaa
 According to their additional uses, the form, shape, density, state of matter are chosen

 carbonic crystalia pratidipakon ke siddhant == aise pratideepak arometic hydrocarbon hote hai jinke anuon kii sanrachana main benzene ke valay rahete hai
 Other types of molecules may also exist in benzene rings
 chunki carbonic crystalon kii pratidipti aanvik kriya he, is kaaran usko anu kii sthitik urja ke dwaara saralata se spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Figure 1
 shows the electronic fundamental or excited level of the molecule and the allowable oscillation of the molecule
 ek aanevaala uttejan vikiran anu ko ek electronic avasthaa se duusare electronic avasthaa ko le ja saktaa he
 According to Frank Kanden's theory, this transfer takes place at a constant differential atomic distance
 a' bahut hi adhik uttejit dolan avasthaa he
 The excess energy is immediately dissipated by 'trap oscillations' in the form of heat
 is prakaar anu str ba se ba' par pahunch jaataa he
 Now, if this excited electronic state of the molecule cannot dissipate energy in any other way, then it will finally emit fluorescent light by descending into the basic electronic level in 10-8 seconds
 yah prakaash nimnaankit ritiyon dwaara ruuk yaa 'bujh' saktaa he : electronic uttejit avasthaa se sidhe moolbhoot avasthaa main urja kaa sankraman sambhav he tathaa anu kaa vishleshan str a yadi paryaapt unchaa ho
 Carbon crystals are often transparent for their fluorescent light
 yah baat bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki nishkasit urja avashoshit urja kii tulana main adhik he
 Anthracene and transstilbene have proved to be the most useful among the various organic crystals studied so far
 acarbonic crystal praaia: elkali hellide ke hote hai
 In these, a small amount of impurities, which acts as stimulants in the work of photosynthesis, is mixed
 sandipti ke utpann hone kii pranali thoson ke band siddhant ke aadhaar par uttam dhang se samajhi ja sakati he
 The crystal configuration consists of groups of ions arranged far away from each other
 ye band banate hai
 They are made up of allowed and forbidden energies
 inaki mul avasthaa main electron bhare rahete hai
 This is called a complemented band
 iske upar ek varjit band rahata he, jo purit band ko ardhapurit band se pruthak karata he
 The semifinished band is formed by widening the atomic level of higher energy
 iske upar ek band rahata he, jisamen electron nahin rahata
 This is called 'convection band'
 yah parmaanu ke ynikaran ke anuroop hota he
 The widening of the lines of an atom is due to the effect on the valence electron of the atom of the combined electric fields around it
 yadi jaalak ke kisi bindu par kisi apdravya ke parmaanu, jaise taanbe ke parmaanu pravisht karaae, jaayan, to usase urjavastha chaudee nahin hogi or viviktavastha main chali jaaygi
 In some circumstances narrow permissible levels between bands may arise
 koi vikiran, jaise newcleey vikiran, crystal par girakar electranon ko purit band se sanvahan band main ek uttejit avasthaa main pahunchaa detaa he
 When the electrons return to the band complemented by the convection band, the energy is released
 vah electron, jo sanvahan band main uttejit hokar pahunch jaataa he, ab saare crystal main ghumta phirata kisi apurnataa ke nikat pahunchakar us 'apurnataa' ke urjaster par aa jaataa he
 From this new level, it can fall back into the forbidden band and release radiation 1 This is the cause of fluorescence
 iske bajaay electron ek vikiranheen kriya dwaara, jaise tapiya urja yaa jaalak dolan main, apni urja ko kho saktaa he1 is kriya ko bujhane kii kriya kehete hai, kyonki yah kriya vikiran ke utsarjan ko rokatii he
 Another possibility is to trap the electron at the energy level corresponding to the atom of that inertia
 us avasthaa ko mitasthayee avasthaa kehete hai
 The electron remains in this dormant state until it is picked up and brought back to the convection band
 yahan se electron apni urja kaa kshay upar likhit kriyaaon dwaara kar saktaa he
 If the electron emits radiation by falling into the complemented band after being trapped in the transient state, that effect is called 'phosphorescence'
 crystal main thodi thodi maatra main uchit apdravya ke parmaanuon ko daalane se ve parmaanu pratideeptikendron kaa kaary karne lagate hai
 These impurities are called 'activators'
 kuch acarbonic pratideeptikon ke apane sakriyakaarakon sahit udhaaharan hai : thallium mila sodium iodide, tin mila lithium iodide tathaa chaandi mila zinc sulphide
 In gaseous fluorescent materials, light comes from gas molecules, which are excited and ionized as the absorbed particles pass through themselves
 utkrisht gaison kaa is drushtikon se vishesh rup se adhyayan kiya gaya he
 From the descriptions of Northarp and Nobles, it appears that the genon seems to be the most useful for this work
 prayek uttejit parmaanu yaa aayan apni mul avasthaa main lagbhag 10-9 second ke bheetar ek yaa adhik photon utsarjit kar detaa he
 In this way a strong luminosity is produced
 mukhyatya yah prakaash parabangnee kshetra main hota he
 The photoelectron's ability to change light photons is very low
 is kaaran kshamta badhaane ke liye kai vidhiyaan upyog main laai jaati hai, jaise koshthak kii deevaaron par ek madhyamik pratideept padaarth, tetraphenl nutadine yaa quarter phenoyl, kii part laga di jaati he, taaki tarangadairghy dur parabangnee se aise tarang dairghy main khisak aae jo photocathod kii spectrum grahita se mail khaae
 Recently the liquid and solid form of xenon has been studied

 vibhinn prakaar ke villeyon kaa pareekshan kiya gaya he
 Among these, the most satisfactory para-turphenyl, diphenyl oxazole and tetraphenyl butadiene, and xylene, toluene, and phenyl cyclohexane have been found in the solvents
 jaise jaise viley kii sandratha kam maatra se aarambh karke badhaai jaati he vaise vaise pratidipti badhati jaati he
 It passes through a wide maximum peak before reaching saturation
 adhiktam pratidipti ke liye paraterfenil kaa toluin main sandran 5 gram prati litre he
 The excitation in the solvent by incoming nuclear radiation is transferred to the solute immediately before the excitation is extinguished
 uttejan urja kaa patan hokar viley dwaara uskaa avasorana ho jaataa he
 Later the same energy is transmitted as fluorescent radiation to the properties of this solute
 uttejan ke vilaayak se viley ke anuon main sthanantaran kii vidhi spasht rup se gyaat nahin he
 Kalman and First Photon do not accept the principle of transfer of energy
 ve ek duusare siddhant ko hi thik maanate hai
 According to this theory, the exchange of energy occurs due to quantum mechanics resonance in molecules
 iske vipareet barks kaa mat he ki urja kaa sthanantaran photon dwaara hi hota he or pratidipti main vilaayak ke anuon ke mahatv par jor dete hai
 Swank and Buck have studied solid solutions of organic materials, such as turphenyl, in polystyrene
 inhone isaki pratidipti crystalia anthracin kii pratidipti kii kshamta kaa 38% pai he
 According to these people, the best substance is dissolved in 100 grams of polyvinyl toluene, one gram of 1,1,4, 4- tetraphenyl, 1, 3-vortadine
 thos tathaa taral vilyanon main pratidipti kii utpatti kii pranali samaan prathit hoti he or donon ke liye viley tathaa vilaayak samaan rup se hi kaary karte prathit hote hai
 But there can be differences in the system of energy transfer from solvent to solute

 The Chidambaram Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva which is located in the middle of the temple town of Chidambaram, 78 kilometers to the south from Pondicherry and 60 kilometers towards the north of Cuddalore district, Cuddalore district is the southeastern state of India
 It is the east-central part of Tamil Nadu
 sangam clasix viduvelvidugu perumatakkan ke paaramparik vishwakarmaaon ke ek sammanneey khandaan kii ore sanket karata he jo mandir punarnirmaan ke pramukh vaastukar the
 There have been many renovations in the history of the temple, especially by the Pallava / Chola rulers during the ancient and pre-medieval period
 hindu sahitya main, chidambaram paanch pavitra shiv mandiron main se ek he, in paanch pavitra mandiron main se prayek mandir paanch prakritik tatwon main se kisi ek kaa pratinidhitiv karata he; chidambaram akaash kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The other four temples in this category are: Thiruvanaikaval Jambukeswara, Kanchi Ekambareswara, Thiruvannamalai Arunachaleswara and Kalahasti Nathar
 yah mandir kaa bhawan he jo shahar ke madhya main sthit he or 40 acre ke kshetra main failaa hua he
 It is an ancient and historical temple dedicated to Lord Shiva Nataraja and Bhagavan Govindaraja Perumal, it is one of the few temples where both Shaiva and Vaishnavite deities are revered in one place
 shaiva mat ke anuyaayiyon yaa shaiva mataavalambiyon ke liye, shabd coil kaa arth hota he chidambaram
 isi prakaar, vaishnav mat kaa paalan karne waalon ke liye iskaa arth hota he shrirangam yaa thiruvarangam 
 The word Chidambaram appears to be derived from Chit, meaning "consciousness" and Ambaram, meaning "sky"; This indicates towards Chidakasam, the ultimate aim should be to attain the sky of consciousness, according to the Vedas and religious texts
 ek anya siddant yah he ki ise chit + ambalam se liya gaya he
 Ambalam means a "stage" for performing arts
 Chidakasam is a state of ultimate bliss or bliss and Lord Natarajar is considered a symbol of this supreme bliss or bliss Natanam
 shaiva mat waalon k yah vishwaas he ki chidambaram main ek baar darshan karne se vah mukt ho jaayenge
 According to another theory, the name is derived from Chitrambalam, in which Chithu means "dance or play of Gods" and Ambalam means "stage"
 is mandir kii ek anuthi visheshta aabhushanon se yukt nataraj kii chhavi he
 It represents Lord Shiva as the deity of Bharatanatyam dance and is one of the few temples where Shiva is revered as an anthropomorphic idol in place of the ancient lingam

 This was the culmination of a long-standing legal battle between the Tamil Nadu government and the Dixitar community
 isaki shuruyaat tab hui jab sarkaar ne gaiyr-deekshitar logon ko bhi 'pavitra garbhagrih' main bhagwaan shiv kii thevaram stuti gane kii anumati de di, jis par deekshitar samudaay ne aapatti kii or yah daawa kiya ki unhen nataraj ke garbhagrih main puja karne kaa visheshadhikaar praapt he
 The legend of Chidambaram begins with the legend of Lord Shiva wandering in Thillai Vanam, a species of Vayushif trees - presently found in the humid region of Pichavaram near Chidambaram
 mandir kii pratimaaon main un thilaai vrikshon kaa chithran he jo duusari shatabdi sei ke kaal ke hai)
 a group of sadhus or 'sages' lived in the forests of Thillai who believed in the power of Tilism and believed that the deity could be subdued by rites and 'mantras' or magical words
 bhagwaan jangal main ek alokik sundarata va abha ke saath bhraman karte hai, vah is samay ek 'pitchatandar' ke rup main hote hai, arthath ek saadhaaran bhikshu jo bhiksha maangata he
 He is followed by his charming figure and companion who is Lord Vishnu in the form of Mohini
 rishigan or unki patniyaan mohak bhikshuk or uski patni kii sundarata va abha par mohit ho jaati hai
 Seeing their wives thus captivated, the sages become enraged and create many 'snakes' by invoking magical rites
 bhikshuk ke rup main bhraman karne vaale bhagwaan sarpon ko uthaa lete hai or unhen aabhushan ke rup main apane gale, aabharahit shikha or qamar par dhaaran kar lete hai
 On becoming even more angry, the sages invoke and produce a terrifying tiger, whose skin is removed and tied by the Lord in the form of a sheet
 puri tarah se hatotsahit ho jane par rishigan apni sabhi aadhyatmik shaktiyon ko ekatra karke ek shaktishaalee rakshas muyalakan kaa aahvaan karte hai - jo purna agyanta or abhimaan kaa pratik hota he
 Bhagavan climbs the demon's back with a gentle smile, making him unable to move and performing his true form with joy on his back
 aisa dekhakar rishigan yah anubhav karte hai ki yah devtaa satya hai tathaa jaadu va sanskaron se pare hai or vah samarpan kar dete hai
 Ananda Tandava Mudra of Lord Shiva is a very famous Mudra which is recognized by many people in the world
 This cosmic dance posture tells us how a Bharatanatyam dancer / dancer should dance
 yah sab ve pramukh vasteen he jinhen nataraj kii murti or brahmadia nrity mudra chitrit karte hai
 The Melakdambur temple, which is about 32 km from here, is a rare Tandava pose
 is karakoyal main, ek bail ke upar nrity karte hue nataraj or iske chaaron ore khadey hue devtaa chitrit hai, yah mandir main raakhi gayi paala kala style kaa ek namoona he
 The surplus serpent, who is in the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as the bed of God, hears about the Ananda Tandava and starts to get impatient to see it and enjoy it
 bhagwaan use aashirwad dete hai or use sanket dete hai ki vah 'patanjali' kaa sadhvik rup dhar le or phir use is soochna ke saath thilaai van main bhej dete hai ki vah kuch hi samay main vahaan par yah nrity karenge
 Patanjali, who was practicing in the Himalayas during the Krit period, goes with another saint Vyagrapathar / Pulikalamuni
 rishi patanjali or unke mahaan shishy rishi upamanyu kii kahani vishnu puranan or shiv puranan donon main hi bataayi gayi he
 He roams in Thillai forest and worships Lord Shiva as a Shivalinga, the God who is worshiped today as Thirumoolataneswarar
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar yah mana jaataa he ki bhagwan shiv ne in donon rishiyon ke liye apane shaashvat anand ke nrity kaa pradarshan - nataraj ke rup main tamil maah thai main pusam nakshatra ke din kiya
 Chidambaram has also been mentioned in many works such as Thillai, Perumpatrapuliyur or Vyaghrapuranam
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mandir brahmand ke kamalrupi madhya kshetra main avasthit he": viraat hridaya padam sthalam 
 vah sthaan jahaan par bhagwan shiv ne apane shaashvat aanad nrity kaa pradarshan kiya tha, anand tandav - vah aisa kshetra he jo "thirumulatneswar mandir" ke thik dakshin main he, aaj yah kshetra ponambalam / porsabai ke naam se janaa jaataa he jahaan bhagwan shiv apni nrity mudra main virajte hai
 Therefore, God is also known as Sabhanayakar, which means the God of the stage
 swarna chat yukt manch chidambaram mandir kaa pavitra garbhagrih he or yahaan teen swaroopon main devtaa virajte hai: Chidambaram is one of the five booth booths where the god is worshiped as his avatar, such as the sky or the agayam
 anya hai: Chidambaram is also one of the five places where it is said that Lord Shiva danced in these places and all these places have stage / gatherings
 chidambaram ke atirikt vah sthaan jahaan por sabhai he, anya thiruvalangadu main ratina sabhai, kortallam main chitra sabhai, madurai minakshi amman mandir main rajat sabhai yaa velli ambalam or thirunelaveli main nellppar mandir main thamira sabhai 
 Saint Sundar starts his Thiruthondar Thogai from here, by honoring the priests of the Thillai temple
 thilaai ke pujaariyon ke bhakton ke liye, main ek bhakt hum
 Four poet saints have immortalized this temple and its deity forever in their poems - Thirugnana Sambanthar, Thirunavukkarasar, Sundaramoorthy Nayanar and Manikavyasagar
 The combined works of the first three are often known as Devaram but this is incorrect
 maatr appar ke geet devaraam ke naam se jane jate hai
 The songs of Sambanthar are known as Thirukadaiyakappu
 sundarar ke geet thirupatu ke naam se jane jate hai
 Thirugnana Sambanthar composed two songs in praise of Lord of Chidambaram, Thirunavukkarasar alias Appar composed 8 devarams in praise of Nataraja and Sundarar composed 1 song in praise of Lord Nataraja
 manikavyasagar ne do kritiyon kii rachana kii thi, pehali kaa naam tiruvsakam he jiseke adhikansh bhaag kaa paath chidambaram main kiya gaya he or tiruchitrambalakkovaiyyar, jiskaa purna paath chidambaram main kiya gaya he
 It is said that Manikavyasagar attained spiritual knowledge in Chidambaram

 There are a total of 9 gates in the temple, out of which 4 are built on high pagodas or gopurams
 Each gopuram has 7 levels on the east, south, west and north sides
 poorviy pagoda main bhartiya nrity style - bharatnatyam kii sampurna 108 mudraayen ankit hai
 These are 5 meetings or stage or hall: paanch sabhaaiyon ke atirikt anya sthal hai: There are many other small shrines in the premises of the temple

 Many water bodies are available in and around the Chidambaram temple
 chidambaram mandir ke bhawan main bhagwaan govindraj perumal or unki sahachari pundarigavalli thayyar kaa bhi mandir he
 It is claimed that this temple is Thillai Thiruchitrakootam and is one of the 108 divine orders - or one of the major shrines of Lord Vishnu, which has been sanctified by the praises sung by prominent devotees of Lord Vishnu
 Chitrakootam was sung by Kulasekara Alwar and Tirimangai Mannan Alwar
 donon alwaron ne kaha he ki chidambaram brahman hi vah brahman hai jo chitrakootem main bhagwaan kii vaidic evam uchit puja kar rahe the
 However, there are many controversies in this regard, as many believe that the Chitrakootam that Alwar people are pointing to may be the Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh where Rama spent time in the ashram of sages like Vishwamitra and Atri
 
 lekin is tarah kiye gaye sabhi daawey vyarth hai kyonki ajhwars mangalsasanam kaa baariki se adhyayan karne par un dharmik sthalon kaa pataa chalata he jo bhugolic avasthaa ke aadhaar par ek kram main rakhe gaye hai jaise, mahabalipuram, tiruvayindrapuram, chidambaram, sirgajhi, thirunangur ityadi
 vaishnav mataavalambiyon kii ore se aisa bhi aitihaasik daawa kiya gaaya he ki mularoop se yah mandir bhagwaan shri govindrajaswami kaa nivas tha or bhagwaan shiv apni sahachari ke saath unase sampark karne aaye the jisase ki vah yugal jode ke madhya nrity pratispardhaa ke nirnaayak ban jaayen
 bhagwaan govindrajaswami is baat par sahamat ho gaye or or shiv evam parvati donon ke madhya barabari par nrity pratispardhaa chalati rahi jiske dauraan bhagwaan shiv vijayi hone kii yukti jaanane ke liye shri govindrajaswami ke paas gaye or unhone sanket diya ki vah apana ek pair uthaayi hui mudra main nrity kar sakate hai
 For women, according to the Natya Shastra, this pose was forbidden, so when Lord Shiva finally came into this posture, Parvati accepted defeat and that is why the idol of Lord Shiva is in the dance posture at this place
 nrity manch yaa khule maidan ko praayah ambalam kaha jaataa he
 Lord Govindarajaswamy was both the adjudicator and witness of this competition
 lekin baad main shaiva dharmonmatta raajaaon jaise kirumi kanda chol aadi ke saanskrithik akraman ke dauraan is sthal ko ek shaiva dharmik sthal ke rup main adhik prachaarit kar diya gaya
 The Dhikshita community was forced into Shaiva followers
 mandir kaa khaakaa or vaastukala darshanik arthon se paripurna he
 The chariot of the Chidambaram temple is perhaps the most beautiful example of a temple chariot in entire Tamil Nadu
 yah rath jis par bhagwaan nataraj varsh main do baar baithte hai, tyoharon ke dauraan asankhya bhakton dwaara khinchi jaati he
 According to the Agra rules, an ideal Shiva temple would have five types or circumambulation and each of them would be divided by a wall within each
 aatanrik parikrama pathon ko chhodkar anya bahari parikrama path khule akaash ke neeche honge
 In the innermost circumambulation path, the principal deity and other gods will sit
 pradhan devtaa kii thik sidh main ek kashtha kaa yaa pathar kaa vishaal dhwaja stambh hoga
 The sanctum sanctorum will be located in the innermost circumambulation path
 isamen param prabhu, shiv virajman honge
 The symbolism behind the structure of a Shiva temple chidambaram mandir or uske pratik Saint Thirumoolar, whose legend is intricately linked to Chidambaram, says in his work Thirumanthiram திருமந்திரம் When written in the Hindi vocabulary, these words express the following: "arth: "shivlinga maanav sharir kaa ek rup he; isi prakaar chidambaram bhi, isi prakaar sadasivan bhi or unka pavitra nrity bhi"
 Symbols of Nataraja Swamy chidambaram main bhagwaan shiv ke niraakaar swarup kii puja kii jaati he
 It is said that Lord Param Anand is continuously dancing in the state of "anand Tandava" with his companion power or energy called Sivagami
 ek pardaa is sthaan ko dhak letaa he jise jab daalaa jaataa he to swarna 'vilve' patron kii jhaalaren dikhaayi padati hai jo bhagwaan kii upasthiti kaa sanket detii hai
 This curtain is dark colored from its outer side and bright red color from the inner side
 pratidin ke sanskaron ke dauraan, us din ke pramukh pujari swayan devatv kii avasthaa main - shivoham bhav, parade ko hataate hai yah agyanta ko hataane kaa sanket hota he or vah sthaan tathaa bhagwaan kii upasthiti dikhaayi padane lagaati he
 Thus the Chidambara mystery represents a period when a person, fully devoted, allows God to intervene and remove ignorance, even when we are able to 'see and experience' his presence and enjoyment
 
 mandir kaa prabandhan or prashasan paaramparik rup se chidambaram deekshitar dwaara dekha jaataa he - yah vaidic brahmanon kaa ek varg he, jo puranic kathaon ke anusaar, sant patanjali dwaara kailash parvat se yahaan laaye gaye the, mukhya rup se dainik sanskaron ke sampadan or chidambaram mandir kii dekharekh ke liye
 It is believed that the people of the Dixitar community numbered 3000 and were called Tillai Muvaram
 aaj unki sankhya 360 he
 These Dixitars follow the Vedic rites unlike the Sivacharis or Adhishivars - those who follow the inaugural rites to worship Lord Shiva
 mandir main nishpadit sanskaar vedon se samaanukramit hai or inhen patanjali dwaara nirdhaarit kiya tha, jinke liye yah mana jaataa he ki unhone hi deekshitar samudaay ke logon ko nataraj ke rup main bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana karne ke liye niyukt kiya tha
 Generally, each married male member of the Dixitar family gets an opportunity to perform the rites in the temple and can also act as the head priest on that day
 vivaahit deekshitar mandir kii aay main hissaa paane ke adhikari bhi hote hai
 Although it is believed that the temple has been donated about 5,000 acres of fertile land - and the temple has also been patronized for many centuries by many rulers, today, it is managed almost entirely by private donations
 din kaa armbh us din ke pramukh pujari dwaara swayan ko pavitra karne ke sanskaron ke nishpaadan or shivoham ko grahan karne ke saath hota he, jiske pashchaat vah dainik sanskaron ko karne ke liye mandir ke andar pravesh karte hai
 The day starts at 7 am from Pallirai by placing Lord's Charanapaduka in a palanquin through the lane in the sanctum sanctorum, behind this palanquin with devotees carrying Majira, Amaranth and Mridang
 iske baad pujari yajna or 'gau puja' se dainik sanskaar shuru karte hai
 The puja is performed 6 times a day
 prayek puja ke pehle, sphatik ling - 'aru urva' yaa bhagwaan shiv ke ardh saakaar rup kaa ghi, doodh, dahi, chaaval, chandan mishran or pavitra bhashm dwaara abhishek kiya jaataa he
 The Lord is then offered Naivedyam or freshly made food and sweets and is offered a deep prayer, a ritual in which a variety of ornamental lamps are shown to the Lord, the Vedas and Panchapuranas are recited in Sanskrit
 pujari dwaara chidambara rahasyam ko prakat karne ke liye pavitra garbhagrih kaa pardaa hathaaye jane ke saath hi puja samaapt ho jaati he
 Before the second puja, in addition to the consecration of the linga of the rhinestone with regular objects, all these items are also inscribed on the Nataraja deity of a ruby
 teesri puja dopaher main 12 baje ke aasapaas hoti he jiske baad mandir 4:30 baje tak ke liye band ho jaataa he
 The fourth puja is performed at 6 o'clock in the evening, the fifth puja is performed at 8 o'clock in the night and the last puja of the day is done at 10 o'clock in the night, after which the Charanpaduka of the Lord is taken as a procession to make it a night
 To be 'retired'
 Before the fifth puja at night, the priests perform some special rites in the Chidambara mystery, where they were engraved on the yantra with perfumed substances and offered 'naivedyam'
 chidambaram main antim puja, jise arthjama puja kehete hai vah vishesh utsaah ke saath kii jaati he
 It is believed that when the gods retire at night, all the divine powers of the universe retire within them

 However this decision has been challenged by the Podu Dixitar community

 The matter is currently under consideration in the Supreme Court of India

 His proposal is to conduct Archana tickets and Darshan tickets

 However, the process of sacraments is still managed by medics
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki manushyon kaa ek purna varsh devataaon ke maatr ek din ke baraabar hota he
 Just as it is worshiped 6 times a day in the sanctum sanctorum, anointing is performed 6 times a year for the presiding deity - Lord Nataraja

 Hundreds and thousands of people gather to watch this consecration program and to watch the traditional dance of the Lord when the deity is taken back to the sanctum sanctorum

 Most of the temples in the south are 'living' samadhis, that is to say, these are places where prayers are offered from the beginning, regular visits by devotees and regular maintenance
 puraanon main yah ullekh he ki sant pulikaalamuniver ne raja simmavarman ke madhyam se mandir ke anekon kaaryon ko nirdeshit kiya
 Among the Pallava kings, there were three kings named Simmavarman
 Since the temple was already famous during the time of the poet-saint Thirunavukkarasar, it is more likely that Simmavarman was in the period 430–458, ie Simmavarman II
 Pattayam or proclamations made on copper letters in Kottra Vankudi prove this
 haalanki, thandanthotta pattayam or pallav kaal ke anya pattayam is or sanket karte hai ki simmavarman kaa chidambaram mandir se sambandh tha
 Hence it is believed that Simmavarman was the prince of the Pallava dynasty who had renounced royal rights and came to live in Chidambaram
 chunki aisa paaya gaya he ki pulikaal muniver or simmavarman samakaleen the, isliye yah mana jaataa he ki mandir isi kaal ke dauraan nirmit hua tha
 However, the fact that saint-poet Manikavyasagar lived in Chidambaram and found supernatural knowledge, but his period is much earlier than that of saint-poet Thirunavukkarasar and did not compare Lord Nataraja and his unique posture and presentation to other works of the Pallava dynasty
 Because it is very superior, it is possible that the temple existed since the time of Simmavarman and no Pulikalamunivara in later times The Saints may have been
 samayik antaraalon par bade str par marammat or navinikaran kaary karaaye jate hai, nayi suvidhaayen jodi or pratishthit kii jaati hai
 Most of the ancient temples have also been 'developed' over time and by new facilities, the rulers who patronized the temple, their gates and more outer corridors and gopurams were built
 yadhyapi is prakriya ne puja sthalon ke rup main mandiron ke astitv ko bane rahane main sahaayta kii, kintu ek purna puratathvik yaa aitihaasik drushti se in navinikarnon ne bina manshaa ke hi amndir ke mul vavastavik kaaryon ko nasht kar diya - jo baad kii bhavy mandir yojanaon se samanta nahin rakhte the
 The Chidambaram temple is also no exception to this common practice
 atah mandir kii utpatti or vikaas kaaphi had tak saahitiyik or kaavyatmak kaaryon ke sambandhit sandarbh dwaara nishkarshith he, maukhik jaankario deekshitar samudaay dwaara or ab shesh rah gayi atyant alp pandulipiyon va shilalekhon ke madhyam se peedi dar peedi hastantarit hoti gayi
 Through Sangam literature we know that the rulers of the Chola dynasty were great devotees of this ancient religious site
 chol raja kochengannan ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki unka janm raja subhadevan or kamaladevi ke baad hua tha, jinaki thilaai swarna haul main puja kii jaati he
 Therefore, it is likely that this temple including the Golden Hall has existed since thousands of years ago
 mandir kii vaastukala - visheshkar pavitra garbh grih kii vaastukala chol vansh, pande vansh yaa pallav vansh ke anya kisi bhi mandir kii vaastukala se mail bhi nahin karti he
 To a extent, this form of temple has certain similarities that correspond to the temple forms of the Chera dynasty, but the earliest known reference to the Chera dynasty is of the era of the poet-saint Sundarar
 durbhagyavash chidambaram mandir yaa isse sambandhit kaary ke uplabdh pramaan 10 veen shatabdi or uske baad ke hai
 Several inscriptions related to the Chidambaram temple are available in the surrounding areas and also in the temple itself
 adhikansh uplabdh shilaalekh nimna kaalon se sambandhit hai: Dakshin Gopuram was built by King Pandya
 iskaa pramaan pandya rajvansh ke machhlee ke pratik dwaara miltaa he jo chat pat gadha gaya he
 Historically, it is believed that on completion of the construction of Gopiram, the Pandya dynasty had built two fish in front of each other
 The South Gopuram has a two-fish insignia of the Pandya dynasty
 aisa lagata he ki iske baad gopuram ko pallav raja coperunsingan i 1216-1242 sei ne punah banwaaya, pratham str ko purna karne ke uparant
 gopuram ko sokkasiyan thirunilai exugopuram kehete hai
 Western Gopuram was built by Jadavavarman Sundar Pandyan i 1251-1268
 uttari gopuram vijay nagar ke raja krishnadevarir 1509-1529 sei dwaara banwaaya gaya tha
 The Eastern Gopuram was first built by the Pallava king Koperunsingan II 1243-1279

 aaj tak pachaippa trust mandir ke vibhinn kaaryon ke liye utaradaayi he or mandir ke rath kaa bhi rakrakhaav karti he
 It is said that the golden roof of the Chitasabha was put up by the Chola king Parantaka I
 raja parantka II, rajraja chol I, kulothunga chol i ne mandir ke nimitt mahatvapurn daan kiya
 Rajaraja Chola's daughter Kundavai II is also known for donating gold and wealth to the temple
 baad main chol raja vikram chol ne bhi dainik sanskaron ke karne ke liye mandir ko kaaphi daan diya
 Gold and jewelery were donated to the temple by many kings, rulers and patrons - including Sheri Sethupathi, Maharaja of Pudukottai, British etc
 uttari bharat ke anekon mandir jin par anekon videshi akramanakariyon ne hamale kiye the, unke vipareet dakshin bharat ke mandiron kaa astitv kai yugon se shantipurna rahaa he
 This is often the reason behind the flourishing of temples in South India
 haalanki, yah shantipurna itihaas bhi halaki fulki muthbhedon se achoota nahin rahaa he
 An incident when the temple's Dixitar community received 1597 CE
 There is some historical evidence in connection with the problem of forcible expansion of the Govindaraja temple by the commander of the Vijayanagara Empire
 is ghatana ke dauraan kai deekshitar oonche pagoda durg se kud gaye or apana jivan samaapt kar liya, unhen apan pavitra or atyant priy mandir ko nasht hote dekhne ke sthaan par mrityu ko swikaarna hi adhik uchit laga
 The incident is recorded by a traveler, the Jesuit Dharmacharya Pimenta

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language

 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european

 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought

 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued

 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc

 deen-e-ilaahi 1582 isvi main mughal samraat akbar dwaara samroop ek samroop dharm tha, jisamen sabhi dharmon ke mul tatwon ko daalaa, isame pramukhataa hindu evam islam dharm the
 Apart from these, the basic ideas of Parsi, Jain and Christianity were also included
 haalaanki is dharm ke prachaar ke liye usne zyada kuch nahi kiya keval aapane vishwast logon ko hi isamen sammalit kiya
 It is said that apart from Akbar, only King Birbal was a follower till his death
 dabestan-e-majahab ke anusaar akbar ke pashchaat keval 19 logon ne es dharm ko apanaaya kalantar main akbar ne ek nae panchang kii rachana kii jisamen kii usne ek ishwariya samvath ko armbh kiya jo akbar kii rajbhishek ke din se prarambh hot tha
 He wrote allahu-akbar on the back of the then coins which was the word Anakarthi
 akbar kaa shabdic arth he "mahaan" or allahu-akbar shabd ke do arth ho sakate the "allaah mahaan hai " yaa "akbar hi allaah hai"
 deen-e-ilahi was like an ethic and not a religion in the true sense
 isamen bhoga, ghamand, ninda karnaa yaa dosha lagaana varjit the evam inhen paap kaha gaya
 Kindness, thoughtfulness and moderation were its pillars
 akbar prasiddh tirth, kurukshetra pahunchaa
 There is a big fair on solar eclipse even today
 log snaan karte hai
 At that time, some sage-recluse also came to bathe in the pool of Kurukshetra, but there was a dispute among them which party should bathe first
 aaj bhi pehle snaan karne par jhagada hota he
 Therefore, when this dispute could not be settled, both parties requested the king
 donon ke hi apane-apane daawey the, par badshaah ko koi bhi nishchit pramaan na mil sake
 It seems, the young man Akbar thought of some pranks
 usne kaha- donon aapas main lard len, jis dal kii jeet ho jaae vahi pehle snaan kare
 a party complained that there were more people in the opposition party
 vinodi akbar ne kaha ki thik he, jiske paas kam aadmi hon, vah utane hi shahi sainik le le
 What was it then, someone caught someone's beard, someone got someone's hair
 is ghamaasan kaa bada mazedaar chithran akbar-naame kii shahi prati main hua
 Painters accompanying Akbar have painted the event
 chitra ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki dur par khadaa ghudsavaar akbar bhi is tamaashe kaa mazaa le rahaa tha
 There were also Jains in Akbar's court, it is said by both Badauni and Abul Fazl
 do pramukh jain muni hir vijayaji tathaa unke shishy vijaysen suri uske darbar main aae
 Both of these were Shwabantar Jains
 inamen hir vijayaji suri ko to 1584 i
 main akbar kaa farmaan praapt hua kiparyushan parv main jeev hinsa na ho
 People should not commit violence in front of Jains and do not eat meat
 hir vijayaji ke prati akbar kii badi shraddha rahi hogi
 Abul Fazl has written that he was a religious man of the highest order
 inke prabhaav se akbar ko jeev hinsa ke prati aruchi hui or usne kai khaas tithiyon par apane samrajya main jeev hinsa kii manaahi kar di
 He himself became against meat eating
 usne swayan prayek shuukravaar shaakaahaari bhojan karne kaa vrath le liya
 Akbar realized that all religions have the same purpose
 atah usne sarvadharm samanvay arthath sab dharmon kii acchhee baaten lene kaa maarg pakadaa
 This is what he called 'reconciliation family'
 is tarah sab dharmon kii acchhee baton ko lekar usne deen-e-ilaahi chalaaya
 In this, the monotheism of Islam, according to Zoroastrianism, the sun and fire were revered as the light and glory of that god
 hindu or jain dharmon ke ahimsawad kii is dharm par gahari chhap thi
 It has been argued that din-i-ilahi's doctrine of having a new religion is a misconception, which was later born out of the mistranslation of Abul Fazl's works by British historians
 haalanki, yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki sulah-e-kul kii niti, jisamen deen-i-ilaihi kaa saar tha, akbar ne keval dharmik uddeshyon ke liye nahin balki saamaanya shahi prashasnic niti kaa ek bhaag ke rup main apanaaya tha
 This formed the basis of Akbar's policy of religious sympathy
 1605 main akbar kii maut ke samay unke muslim vishyon main asantosh kaa koi sanket nahin tha, or abdul haq jaise ek dharamshastri kii dharna thi ki nikat sambandh bane rahe
 As Emperor, Akbar considered it his duty to get under the religious elements
 ek baar vah fatehpur sikri main praatavkaal ekant main shila par baitha to uske man main yah bhaavana ai ki apni praja main bhedbhaav nahin rakhana chahie
 On the other hand, Mullahs of Islam used to advise persecution of non-muslims
 inke vaad-vivaad itane ugr hone lage ki badshaah ke saamne bhi ve darbari tahjeeb kaa dhyaan na rakhte
 Akbar's tendency to search for truth grew more in this mind
 akbar-namaa main abul fazal likhata he ki iske baad darbar main sabhi dharmon or sampradaayon ke vidwaan bhar gaye
 Everyone's religious beliefs would be considered
 yadi unamem koi kamajori hoti to use prakat kiya jaataa
 Religious tolerance was used, it would envy the wicked and the wicked
 akbar jab aantarik jhagadon se mukt hua to uskaa dharm-sudhaar kii ore dhyaan gaya
 He established a new religion
 isamen usne pavitra quran, brahmanon ke dharamshastra or isa messiah ke upadeshon kaa samanvay kiya
 For this he held a meeting
 isamen sabhi dharmon ke aacharyon ko bulaayaa, saath hi apane manasabadaaron ko bhi bulaayaa
 tha dhyaan dene kii baat he ki sabhi dharmon ke kattarpanthi anuyaayiyon ne akbar ke udaartaapurna drushtikon kaa virodh kiya
 On this, Akbar said- 'under any empire, it is unfair that the public be divided into many religions
 isse aapas main matbhed utpann hota he
 There are as many parties as many religions
 unamem aapas main shatruta hoti he atev sabhi dharmon main samanvay apekshit he
 But it should be done in such a way that despite being one, their specialty remains
 isse sabhi dharmon kii achchhaayiyaan bani rahengi or duusare dharmon kii visheshtaayen bhi aa jaayengi
 This will increase respect for God, peace in the people and security of the empire
 ' The European travelers have said that Akbar's eyes would keep on looking as if the sun was shimmering on the ocean
 uski aawaaj unchi thi, usamen ek anugoonj hoti thi
 If anyone had seen him, he would have known that this is the king
 jahangir kaa kathan he ki log usamen saakshaat ishwar kaa tej pate the
 He used to laugh and at that time his face would get a little deformed with laughter
 use krodh bahut hi kam aata
 He was very patient
 yorapia yatri hairaan the ki uske man kii baat chehre ke bhav se prakat hi na hoti, par krodh main uski akruti asay ho jaati thi
 His mustache hair would grow
 sanyogvash akbar shikaar khilne mathura gaya tha
 There he came to know that Hindus have to pay taxes on coming to Mathura
 usne yatri kar uthaa diya
 Akbar said - Where is the justice to be done on the worship of God! The following year, on the ninth anniversary of his coronation, he also lifted the tax-jizya imposed on non-muslims according to Muslim law
 yah ek anokhi ghatana thi
 Then there was no Jaziya tax for both generations - Aurangzeb imposed Jaziya tax after the death of Jaswant Singh in 1679
 jajia se prativarsh samrajya ko lakhon kii aay hoti

 When Babu goes to Shahaji's house as a kundan, he meets Shahaji's daughter Maya there and slowly falls in love with Maya
 babu ko shahji ke ghar se karch ke liye paisa miltaa rahata he or vah bhagat ko thodaa-thodaa paisa detaa rahata he lekin bhagat ko to sari daulat ek saath hi chahie
 He then threatens Babu and Maya overhears everything and comes to know the truth

 vah hindi upanyaas ke itihaas main manovishleshnatmak parampara ke pravartak ke rup main maanya hai
 Janendra discovers the subtle signs inherent in the generality of his characters and presents them with great skill
 unke paatro kii charitrik visheshtaayen isi kaaran se sanyukt hokar ubhartee hai
 There is very little emphasis on the mobilization of events in Jainendra's novels
 charitron kii pratikriyaatmak sambhaavnaaon ke nirdeshak sutara hi manovigyaan or darshan kaa aashray lekar vikaas ko praapt hote hai
 Jainendra Kumar was born on 2 January 1905, in the village of Kauriaganj in Aligarh

 jainendra kaa sabase bada yogadan hindi gadhy ke nirmaan main tha
 At the language level, the sabotage done by Zainendra did an unprecedented job of shaping Hindi
 jainendra kaa gadhy na hota to agyeya kaa gadhy sambhav na hota
 The Hindi story learned the first lesson of practicality from Janendra
 jainendra ne hindi ko ek paardarshee bhashaa or bhangima di, ek nayaa tevar diya, ek nayaa `sintex' diya
 Jainndra has an indelible mark on today's Hindi prose
 --rabindra kaaliya janendra ke praayah sabhi upanyaason main darshanik or aadhyatmik tatwon ke samavesh se duruhata ai he parantu ye saare tatv jahaan-jahaan bhi upanyaason main samavisht hue hai, vahaan ve paatro ke antar kaa srijan prathit hote hai
 This is why the characters of Jainndra seem unaffected by the external environment and circumstances and are driven by their introverted motions
 unki pratikriyaayein or vyavhaar bhi praayah inhen gatiyon ke anuroop hote hai
 As a result of this, there is a glut of characters in Jainendra's novels

 Elements of revolutionism and militancy are also important bases of Jainendra's novels

 Despite having a kind of tenderness and sense of external nature, interest and behavior, they are great destroyers in their differences
 unka yah vidhwanskaari vyaktitv nari kii premavishyak asweekrutiyon kii pratikriya ke falswaroop nirmit hota he
 For this reason, when they find little shelter, sympathy or love of a woman, then they fall down and then their external nature becomes soft
 janendra ke nari paatr praayah upanyaas main pradhanta liye hue hote hai
 The novelist has introduced subtle psychological vision in the characterization of her female characters
 stri ke vividh roopon, uski kshamtaaon or pratikriyaaon kaa vishwasaneey ankan janendra kar sake hai
 In the novels 'sunita', 'resignation' and 'sukhada', there have been many occasions when her female character has gone through a state of severe mental conflict
 nari or purush kii apurnataa tathaa antarnirbharta kii bhaavana is sangharsh kaa mul aadhaar he
