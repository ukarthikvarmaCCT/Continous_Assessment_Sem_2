 The whole world will condemn me

 At this time those who behave like vampires are hellish
 " Even after explaining this to her husband, she did not understand anything and that lustful Diti took the clothes of Kashyap ji with impudence
 is par kashyap ji ne daiv ichha ko prabal samaj kar daiv ko namaskara kiya or diti kii ichha purna kii or uske baad shuddh jal se snaan kar ke sanathan brahm rup gayatri kaa jap karne lage
 Diti conceived and prayed to Kashyap ji, "O Aryaputra! Lord Bhoothnath forgive my crime and do not destroy my womb

 But they always protect their devotees

 " Diti said, "oh God! i wish that my sons should be slaughtered by God
" brahman ke shaap se na ho kyonki brahman ke shaap ke dwaara praani narak main jaakar janm dhaaran karata he
 "then Kashyap Ji said," Oh God! You are very repentant of your karma, so your grandson will be a great devotee of God and will brighten your fame

 Once the craze, Sanandan, Sanatan and Santkumar went to the Baikunta world to see Lord Vishnu for peace of mind after being disenchanted with the whole world
 baikuntha ke dwaar par jai or vijay naam ke do dwarpal paharaa diya karte the
 Jai and Vijay stopped these sancadic sages at the door itself and started refusing to enter the Baikuntha lok
 unke is prakaar manaa karne par sanakadik rishiyon ne kaha, "are moorkhon! ham to bhagwaan vishnu ke param bhakt hai
 Our speed does not stop anywhere
 ham devadhidev ke darshan karnaa chaahate hai
 Why do you stop us from seeing them? You people live in the service of God, you should be as equitable as them
 bhagwaan kaa swabhaav param shantimay he, tumhaara swabhaav bhi vaisaa hi hona chaiye
 Let us go to see Lord Vishnu
 " rishiyon ke is prakaar kehane par bhi jai or vijay unhen baikuntha ke andar jane se rokane lage
 On stopping this type of Jai and Vijay, the Sankadik sages got angry and said, "even after being close to Lord Vishnu, egoism has come in you and the egoist cannot live in Baikunth
 isaliye ham tumhen shaap dete hai ki tum log paapayoni main jaao or apane paap kaa fal bhugto
 "jai and Vijay, fearing their cursing, fell at his feet and asked for forgiveness
 yah jaan kar ki sanakadik rishigan bhent karne aaye hai bhagwaan vishnu swayan lakshmi ji evam apane samast parshadon ke saath unke swaagat ke liy padhaare
 Lord Vishnu said to him, "O Munishvara! These are my councilors named Jai and Vijay
 in donon ne ahankaar buddhi ko dhaaran kar aapkaa apmaan karke aparaadh kiya he
 You people are my dear devotees and they have disobeyed you by disobeying you

 atah main aap logon kii prasannataa kii bhiksha chahta hoon
 " bhagwaan ke in madhur vachanon se sanakadik rishiyon kaa krodh tatkaal shant ho gaya
 He became very happy with this generosity of God and said, "you give so much respect to Brahmins for keeping the dignity of religion
 he nath! hamane in nirparaadh parshadon ko krodh ke vash main hokar shaap de diya he iske liye ham kshamaa chaahate hai
 If you think it is appropriate, you can forgive these gatekeepers and get rid of our curse
 " Lord Vishnu said, "O monks! i do not want to make the Brahmin's word untrue even after being omnipotent because it violates religion
 aapane jo shaap diya he vah meri hi prerana se hua he
 They are definitely part of this punishment

 Hearing that monster, Varun Dev got very angry, but looking at the time, he laughed and said, "oh brother! Now there is no desire to fight and now we are not even able to fight a powerful warrior like you
 
 tum ko to yajyapurush narayan ke paas janaa chaiye
 They are the only ones capable of fighting you
 varun dev kii baat sunakar us daitya ne devarshi naarad ke paas jaakar narayan kaa pataa poocha
 Devarshi Narada told him that Narayan has taken the form of Varah at this time to take the earth out of the abyss
 is par hiranyaksh rasaatal main pahunch gaya
 There he saw Lord Varah on his molar bringing the earth
 us mahabali daitya ne varah bhagwaan se kaha, "are junglee pashu! tu jal main kahan se aa gaya he? murkh pashu! tu is prithvi ko kahan liye ja rahaa he? ise to brahma ji ne hamen de diya he
 Oh dear! You cannot take this earth from the abyss while i am there
 tu daitya or daanvon kaa shatru he isaliye aaj main tera vadh kar daaloonga
 " hiranyaksh ke in vachanon ko sun kar varah bhagwaan ko bahut krodh aayaa kintu prithvi ko vahaan chhod kar yuddh karnaa unhone uchit nahin samajha or unke katu vachanon ko sahan karte huye ve gajraj ke samaan sheeghra hi jal ke baahar aa gayi
 Chasing him, Hiranyaksha also came out and started saying, "hey coward! You don't feel ashamed to run away? Come and fight me
" " prithvi ko jal par uchit sthaan par rakhkar or apana uchit aadhaar pradaan kar bhagwaan varah daitya kii ore mude or kaha, "are gram singh ! ham to junglee pashu hai or tum jaise gram singhon ko hi dhundte rahete hai
 Now your death is dancing on your head
 " unke in vyang vachanon ko sunakar hiranyaksh un par jhapat padaa
 There was a fierce battle between Lord Varah and Hiranyaksha and in the end Hiranyaksha was killed by Lord Varaha

 Mongoose, like the infamous Dracula - is a vampire who fulfills his sleep by day in a coffin, and by night turns into humans in a neighborhood village turning into bloody bats
 vah apni rojaanaa kii pyaas insaani lahu se puri karata, or use hameshaa jawan auraton ke gosht kii talab rahati 
 The mongoose has a circle of several demonic servants who will arrange innocent people for him to take to the Black Hill where the vampire mongoose easily hunts them
 uske sevak mandali main mahua, mahaguru, ek tantric or aise hi kai mustande kism ke gurgon kii khep maujuud he
 Mahua used to work as a maid at home at Thakur Pratap, considered to be a justice justice
 ek shaam thakur use baku ke saath baaten karte dekh letaa he
 Knowing that Baku is a resident of the devils of the same Kali hill, Thakur immediately threatens Mahua to sack him if he meets the gang again
 baavjood, mahua, pehle kii bhaanti hi nevala ke khufia adeshon kaa paalan karti he
 At the same time, Thakur Pratap would remain depressed after having no children of his wife Lajo, despite having a lot of wealth and a happy life
 sthaneey mandir ke pujari use aashwast to karte, magar vah bhitari taur bahut kshubdh mahasoos karti jab thakur kii mausi unke ghar aati or hidaayat detii, tathaa vansh kii jarurat kaa hawala dekar, dubaara byaah rachaane ko kahati
 At the same time, Mahua promises that Lajo will have children if he goes to the black hill with him, where the mongoose can fulfill his wish, but sometimes a situation arises that if he has a son, she can take him and if he has a daughter She would be born a mongoose and would have to be handed over
 laajo pehle dafe main inkaar karti he, lekin mahua ke purajor bahekaave main aakar laajo yah sauda sweekaar kar leti he
 As a result, Lajo leaves Kali Pahadi, where she is bathed with milk and mongoose appears and hypnotizes her
 aadhi raat ko hi nevala, laajo se shaareerik sambandh banaata he
 Lajoie fully supports the mongoose by entrapping her into sexual intercourse
 savere laajo kii neend khulne par khud ko nevala saath nirvastr paati he
 Lajoie returns to the mansion, unaware that the mongoose has conceived her and as time passes Lajo gives birth to a baby girl, Kamya
 magar mahua jab use bacchee kii baat yaad dilaati he, laajo lagbhag shunya kii sthiti main pad jaati he or tab uske bacchee lekar chal nikalati he
 Mahua gives the poison to Lajo on the instructions of her master, Mongoose
 laajo tab thakur se milti he tathaa sari sachai bayaan karti he or bataati he ki vah kamya ko bachaa le jise mahua aguva kar kaali pahari le gai he
 At the same time, Lajo dies after consuming poison due to the fear of public-shame
 gusse se bifara hua, thakur kaali pahari main pravesh karata he or, ek lanbaa dwand chalata he, jisamen vah nevala kii jaadui shaktiyon ke aage nirast hota he
 Badly wounded, Weasel returns to his coffin staggering and closes the cave door and goes into sleeplessness until he recovers
 kuch bees saalon baad, kamya ek khubasurat yuvati ke rup main badi hoti he
 She gives her heart to Kumar, who is her childhood love but she does not care much about him despite his childhood fun
 kumaar sirf sapana ko chahta tha 
 Sapna was studying in a hostel in Mumbai and one day she meets a woman who asks for a lift to Kali Pahari on the night of Ous Murdani
 sapana use kaali pahari tak chhod aati he magar isse anjaan ki usase ek kitaab car main chhut gai thi
 She lives in a black magic book
 sapana vah kitaab us aurat ko lautaane peeche padati hi he par use vahaan ek vedi par vah aurat dikhaai padati he jo khud duusare pujari kism ke log bali chadhaane kii taiyaari kar rahe hote hai
 Sapna screams after seeing this scene
 bali main vyavdhaan hote dekh pujari apane aadamiyon se use pakad laane ko kehete he lekin vah bhaag khadi hachati he or vah kitaab bhi kaali pahari main chhot jaati he
 Frightened by this statement, Sapna immediately rushes to Kumar's house and tells Anand and her everything
 agle din yah teenon kaali pahari ko ravaanaa hote he, magar unako vaisaa kuch hasil nahin hota jaisaa sapana ne kaha tha
 Sapna says that she was not sleepy and then gets the book which was missing from her last night
 phir vah log kamya se milane chal padate hai jinhone in teenon ko apane janmdin par aane kaa nyauta diya tha
 The case takes an interesting turn when Kumar presents a photo of his love in front of Sapna on Kamya's birthday
 is baat se hairaan, kamya sapana kaa majaak bana detii he jisase sapana vah jagah chhod detii he
 In the meantime, Kamya comes straight to her point, but Kumar leaves her bluntly
 vahiin ghar laut rahi sapana ko vahi aurat milti he jisaki pichhali raat bali chadhaai ja rahi thi
 She asks for the same book from him and sits in Sapna's car
 sapana ghar pahunchati he or kitaab dundh nikaalati he
 This midday, Anand leaves the party in the middle and reaches his house, searching for the dream
 sapana us anjaan aurat ke bare main bataati he
 Anand throws the book out of the house and tells it to stop thinking
 kamya phir us kitaab ko lene nikalati he jahaan kumaar peeche chalaa aata he
 On reaching home, she starts reading a book which describes how Kumar was acquired through witchcraft
 jab kamya us anjaan aurat ko lift de rahi thi, uski car durghatnagrast hoti he, jahaan nevala ke giroh ke log use uthaa laate he
 Kamya is healed of her wounds by the priest's black magic and reveals that she can get everything if she joins their gang, she agrees
 kamya kabristaan main kumaar par jaadu-tone kaa abhyaas karti he
 He reaches there and makes love to her
 anand va sapana vahaan pahonchte he or kumaar ko bachaa lete hai
 Anand finds the pictures of Kumar in the cemetery and feels convinced that he has done all the work that Kamya had done when he had earlier seen Kamya meeting the unknown residents of Kali Pahadi
 ek roj kamya ko kaali pahari par raat main honevaale anushthan par bulaayaa jaataa he
 But in fact, it was a trap to trap Kamya and lead him to a mongoose, which was awakened from years of sleep
 vah kamya ko adheen karne ke liye apane dansh gadaata he or uske saath hambistari karata he
 Now she is imprisoned forever behind this closed door and becomes a mongoose's slave
 kumaar, anand or sapana sabhi log kamya ko bachaane kaali pahari kii ore kooch karte he
 Eventually they find her, she is barely conscious, she lives in a glass coffin placed in the basement of the tombs
 wo use bachaane kii koshish hi karte ki vah jagah dhuen se bhar jaati he or nevala use apahrit kar letaa he
 The tantric subjugates Kamya to his master, Mongoose
 ab kamya ko apane maalik nevala ke liye or ladakiyon kaa intjaam karnaa hota he
 She traps Bhanu in her hoof and takes him to Kali Pahadi, but Kumar, Anand and his companions stop Bhanu from becoming a victim of mongoose lust
 kamya kaa aglaa nishaanaa sapana banati he
 Sapna, too, eventually escapes at the last moment, but Kumar and Anand learn that Kamya is doing so under the control of someone else
 ve yah sari khabar thakur ko bataate hai, or tay karte hai ki ve ek saath milakar shaitan nevala kaa khaatmaa karenge
 As the black hill steps in, Thakur meets Mahua, who informs him that the devils had celebrated the birth of Kamya, and that Kamya is now completely bowed down to the powers of Mongoose
 krodh main aakar, thakur us mahua kaa sir kalam karata he
 But the mongoose is now unstoppable
 vah bhanu ko phir se bulaata he, or is baar, vah dansh gadaane main safal hota he
 Weasel arrives at Thakur's house to threaten Sapna again
 ek lambii bhaag-daud main, nevala ab bhanu or anand ko maarane baad sapana ke saamne khadaa hota he, magar ain vakt par thakur yah sab naakaam karaata he
 And then Thakur tells Kumar and Sapna about Kamya's birth secret
 phir yah teenon kamya ko dhundne kaali pahari main pravesh karte hai
 Eventually they find her, she barely regains consciousness, she lives in a glass coffin placed in the basement of the tombs
 par jald hi unako rokane vahaan tainaat giroh ke bashindon va duusare gurgon ke saath khud nevala bhi kud padataa he
 They all fight among themselves and the mongoose is wounded once again, but it is not possible to kill him in any way
 tabhi uski dusht sevika or tantric taange par nevala ko ladakar faraar hote he
 Kumar chases them, and captures the tantric, and warns him to die in order to inflame the mongoose's weakness
 tantric tab bataata he ki nevala kii aatma kaali pahari ke murti main band he or suraj kii dhoop uski kamajori he
 Kumar and Thakur now move both ways to eliminate the mongoose
 kumaar or sapana taange ko kaali pahari kii ore le chalate he, or basti waalon kii madad se nevala ke bich avrodh daalate hai
 Mongoose angrily attacks them all
 abhi vah sapana tak pahunch paata, anayas hi vah pidaa se jakad jaataa he or sholon main dadhak uthta he 
 In this way, the film ends after Kumar, Sapna and Thakur see the destruction of the mongoose forever

 "" web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 ek shaddashamalav triplate hota he ek chah ank, teen bite shaddashamalav sankhya, jo ki HTML main prayukt hoti he rangon ke pradarshan hetu
 The three bytes represent the red, green, blue components of a single color
 ek bite hoti he 00 se FF tak, yaa 0 se 255 
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red = 36, green = 104, blue = 160
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit 
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows: These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F,BC,8B 
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 saanchaa:color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue 
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
the lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: Dinu Bhai Pant is a noted litterateur of Dogri language

 vah purana udhyami ho saktaa he athwa naveen, use vyavsaay chalaane kaa anubhav ho saktaa he or nahin bhi, vah shikshit bhi ho saktaa he athwa ashikshit bhi, uski prishthbhumi gramin ho sakati athwa shahari
 The entrepreneur has to analyze and determine how much money will be required in the business and for how long
 mashin, bhawan, kaccha maal aadi kharidne tathaa shramikon kii mazdooree aadi chukaane ke liye use dhan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 The money spent for purchasing machinery, buildings, equipment etc
 is called permanent capital
 duusari ore, kaccha maal kray karne tathaa mazdooree tathaa vetan, kiraaya, telipaphone or bijli ke bill kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kharch kiya dhan, kaaryshil poonji kehalaati he
 An entrepreneur has to raise both types of capital
 yah dhan apane ghar se puraa kiya ja saktaa he athwa bank tathaa anya vittiya sansthaaon se rin lekar
 Money can also be borrowed from friends and relatives
 vyavsaay karne kii prakriya tab se prarambh ho jaati he jab udhyami sochna shuru kar detaa he ki vah kis cheez kaa vyavsaay karen
 He may consider business opportunities given the market demand
 vah vidyaman vastu athwa utpaada ke liye nirnay le saktaa he athwa kisi naye utpaada par vichaar kar saktaa he
 But before taking any step, he has to seriously consider the profit, power or profitability of the business and capital investment
 laabhpradata tathaa jokhim kii sthiti par vichaar kar lene ke pashchaat hi vyavsaay kii koun si disha thik rahegi iske bare main udhyami ko nirnay lenaa chahie
 You have received information about various forms of organization
 ab aapako apni aavashyaktaa ke anusaar sarvshereshth rup se chayan karnaa hoga
 It is usually best to choose a small enterprise, which can take the form of a sole practitioner or partnership
 vyavsaay kahan shuru kiya jaay? - is sthaan ke chunaav main vishesh saavdhani baratani chahie
 An entrepreneur can start a business in his own place or at a rented place
 vah sthaan kisi bazaar athwa vyapaarik complex athwa kisi audyogic bhoomi main ho saktaa he
 The entrepreneur should consider a number of factors such as: proximity to the market, availability of labor, convenience of traffic, banking and convection facilities etc
 while making locational decisions
 kaarkaane kii sthapana aise sthaan par kerani chahie, jahaan par puri tarah se sansaadhan kii uplabdhta, kachche maal kii prapti kaa strot ho or vah sthaan rail sadak yatayaat kii suvidha se bhi judaa hua ho
 The retail business should be started in a locality or market
 ek udhyami akelaa hi vyavsaay ko nahin chalaa saktaa
 He will have to hire some people to help him
 vishesh rup se vinirmaan kaary ke liye use prashikshit tathaa ardh-prashikshit kaarigaron ko rakhana hoga
 Before starting the work, the entrepreneur should make sure that he will get the right type of employees for the work to be done

 trikoniya surveykshan us vidhi kaa naam he jisamen surveykshan ke liye diye gayi kshetra ko trikoniya tukdon ke jaal ke rup main baantkar surveykshan ko saraltapurvak kar liya jaataa he
 Its principle is very simple - by measuring the angles drawn by a third point from any two points at a known distance, the correct position of that third point can be determined with the help of trigonometric identities
 isaki visheshta yah he ki isamen duuri kaa maapan kam se kam karnaa padataa he or konon ke maapan se kaam chal jaataa he
 Angles are measured more accurately, in less time, with less labor
 saamanyat:, jahaan do dur ke binduon ke bich sidhi duuri naap paanaa sambhav na ho, magar ve aapas me drushtigat hon, vahaan trikoniya surveykshan bada laabhprad hota he
 If on one, two or all the three sides of such a triangle are made to form consecutive triangles and one side of the initial triangle, the regulator of both its vertices and the angles of all the triangles formed, are known, then the lengths of the sides of such an entire triangle and the triangle If the regulators of the points and the angles of all the triangles formed are known, then the lengths of the sides of the entire triangle Regulators of pointing points can be determined by mathematical calculus
 kisi bhi kshetra kaa maanchitr banane ke liye is prakaar ke bindu sampurna kshetra main samaan rup se bikharen hue sthapit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Such points are collectively called 'control structure' for survey and each point is called a 'survey station' separately
 trikoniya surveykshan main gananaa main trikonmittiya sarvasamikaon kii sahaayta lee jaati he jiname nimnlikhit pramukh hai - The methodology, which is suited to the above grounded principles of triangular survey, is mainly divided into four parts: aisi tribhujamala banane ke liye steshnon kaa chayan, jisase surveykshan hetu saare kshetra main samaan rup se bikhare niyantrabindu uplabdh ho saken, To obtain an arm whose length is known and on which the initial triangle is made and its sides are to be woven with a mesh of successive triangles, banaae gaye tribhujon par krmanugat tribhujon sheershabinduon par bane kshaitij or urdhv kone naapnaa or Calculus of point regulators
 sabase pehla kaam steshnon kaa chayan or unhen chihnit karnaa heta he
 Station points are chosen such that from eight to eighty kilometers away from each other and form a triangulated triangle
 tribhujamala saamanyat: teen prakaar kii hoti hai
 The triangles that meet at one point, or the stations at the other ends of the triangles, are mutually visible and are located at a point so that the angles can be read by placing an inductor, theodolite, at the vertex of each triangle
 kone ek hi bindu se or ek hi bindu ko padhe jaae, is suvidha ke liye prayek stesan ko ek pathar par bindu khod kar chihnit kar dete hai
 a circle is made around it to identify the position of the point exactly and correctly
 aisa sthir pathar yadi us sthal par prakritik rup se uplabdh na ho to pathar alag se laakar aise gaad diya jaataa he ki vrut or binduwali sataha prithvi kii sataha se mili baahar dikhaai detii rahe, jisase surveykshan kitni bhi avadhi se baad us sthaan par jaae to stesan ko pahchaanane main samarth ho
 Often, the surveyor draws circles and centers on two stones for safety
 ek ko lagbhag ek meter gaharaa prithvi ke bheetar gaad detaa he or doosraa prithvi kii sataha par aise rakhata he ki donon vritton ke bich khude centrebindu ek hi urdhwadhar rekha par paden
 Some signs are placed around the stations to facilitate remote viewing
 jis kshetra main surveykshan karnaa ho usamen yadi do bindu aise uplabdh hon jo paraspar drushtigochar hon or unke niamak gyaat hon to ek teesraa samuchit bindu chunakar praarambhik tribhuj usapar banaaya ja saktaa he
 To start in any triangle, an arm must be known
 aisi bhujaa ko aadharekha kehete hai
 If the regulator of the points at the end of the baseline is known, its length can be calculated by calculation
 udaahranarth, yadi un binduon ke niamak mulbindu se uttar-dakshin rekha, koti, par kramash:, , tathaa purv-pashchim rekha, bhuj, par, hon to bhujaa kii lambaai hogi : North side of that arm is kone kii aavashyaktaa niamakon kii gananaa main hoti he
 This is called DINMAN
 yadi aise do bindu uplabdh na hon to aadhaar usee samay naapakar sthapit kiya jaataa he
 For this, the surveyor measures a line a on a convenient flat plot around the starting point, with a tape that gives accurate measurements
 aajkal mukhyat: yah naap feete ko rajjuvakr main taang kar lete hai
 The exact horizontal distance between the ends of the ribbon is calculated by calculation
 us par kramash: aise tribhuj banaae jate hai ki pehle ek yaa do tribhujon ko chhodkar kisi bhi tribhuj kaa koi bhi kone 20 degree se kam na ho
 Starting from the base arm, two angles e and e are taken up to 3 degrees
 magar inhen aavriti vidhi se bahut hi yatharth napate hai
 These angles are measured by a device called theodolite
 aadhaar binduon se aarambh karke kramash: sabhi stesan binduon par theodolite kendrit karke kone pard liye jate hai
 The surveyor examines geometric relationships, such as all three angles of a triangle or four angles of a quadrilateral, as all angles of a triangle or quadrilateral are completed
 prithvi kii sataha golakaar hone ke kaaran tribhuj bahut bade hone par uske konon kaa yoga 180 degree se adhik ho jaataa he
 This type of growing is called spherical excess
 75 varg milewaale tribhuj main yah aadhiky 1"" hota he
 Angles are used in calculations by observing observation errors and spherical excesses
 prekshan samaapt hone par praarambhik tribhuj kii aadhaar bhujaa or naape gaye konon kaa prayog kar trikoshmetiya sutara se sabhi bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan gyaat ho jaati hai
 Thereafter, to remove the regulator, the values of the line or lines connecting the unknown point with the known point or points, which have been mentioned earlier, are removed
 gyaat bindu yaa binduon se agyaat bindu kii duuri da or ko dinman gyaat hone se uske niamak mud kojya ko or prad jya ko gyaat kiye ja sakate hai
 These are called rectangular regulators
 yadi urdhv kone bhi kshaitij prekshan ke saath pad jaaen to agyaat bindu kii oonchaai uu a da sp na hogi
 In the above equations, u, po and u are the Uttarayana and Purvayana heights of the known point respectively and the neither are the distance and the deviation of the unknown points respectively
 prithvi ko golabh maanakar binduon ke bhugolic niamak, arthath akshansh or deshaantar, bhi nikle ja sakate hai
 If only one point is known to initiate a triangular survey, the distance from the known station to the known station of the second chosen station is measured by scaling the baseline, and extracted by the propagating base mesh
 dinman dhruvatara or surya aadi ke khagoleey prekshanon se gyaat karte hai
 If the survey is being started for the first time in an area where none of the points are known, regulators of a point are determined by continuous astronomical observation for a few days
 raat ke samay svachh akaash ko din prati din dekhne se vidit hoga ki bahuterey pahchaanane yogya chamkile taare samaan rup se ek gole kii sataha par tairte se dikhaai dete hai
 Their rise and fall will also be seen regularly
 aise gole ko bhi prithvi kii bhanti yamyottaron or samaantaron se bante hone kii grahya kalpana kii ja sakati he, jo ganitiya sutron kaa paalan karti he
 Taking advantage of these facts, the surveyor is able to extract the regulator of the observation station by observing the wires
 usase or naapi hui adharekha se trikoniya surveykshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Contic or hook-shaped is a form of drainage system in which tributaries are found in the upper part of the main river whose flow direction is opposite to the main river

 virgil dwaara rachit latin mahakavy da anid or kuintus of smirna ke anusaar trogen horse trogen yuddh kii ek katha he
 The events in this tale are from the Bronze Age and were written before Homer's ODC and after the Elyad
 yah unaniyon kii chaal ke dwaara hi sambhav ho paaya kii ve antat troy shahar main pravesh kar sangharsh kaa ant kar paye

 The Greeks pretended to leave and the Trojans pulled the horse into the city as a reward for their victory
 usee raat unani sena kii tukdi ghode se baahar nikal aayi or baaki unani sena ke liye dwaar khol diye, jo andhere kii chadar main waapas aa gayi thi
 The Greek army entered the city of Troy and destroyed it, winning the war and ending it
 unani parampara ke anusaar, homeric ionic bhashaa main ghode ko kaath kaa ghoda tathaa "gift horse" kaha jaataa he
 Symbolically, any such move was called a "trojan horse" by inviting the enemy to a safe place and targeting it

 According to Kuintus Smirnas, Odysseus conceived the idea of building a huge wooden horse, hiding a specific army troop inside it, and fooling the Trojans and rolling the horse on wheels as a symbol of their victory
 
 ipeos ke netritv main, unaniyon ne teen din main lakdi ke ghode kaa nirmaan kiya
 According to Odysseus' plan a man was to live outside the horse; Which the Greeks were supposed to pretend to leave the horse as a gift for the Trojans and leave it behind
 keval ek unani sipaahi sinon ne hi is bhoomika ke liye swayamsevak bananaa sweekaar kiya
 Virgil describes the actual encounter between Sinon and the Trojans: Sinon successfully convinces the Trojans that the Greeks have left him behind
 sinon trogence ko bataata he ki vah ghoda unaniyon dwaara devi athena ko unke troy ke mandir ko apavitra karne ke paap kii kshatipurti karne ke liye or unki ghar ke liye surakshit yatra ko sunishchit karne ke liye ek bhent he
 The reason for making the horse so large was to prevent the Trojans from transporting it to their city and to collect Athena's hermitage for themselves
 sinon se poochtacha ke samay, trogen pujari laokun ko sajeesh kaa anumaan ho jaataa he or ve trogence ko chetavanee dete hai, virgil dwaara likhi gayi ye panktiyaan prasiddh hai "timeo Danos et dona ferentes"

 The Pusanians, who lived two hundred years after Christ, wrote in their account of Greece, "the work of Epius was to make a crack in the wall of the Trojan by a device, it is known to all that the reason for the foolishness of the Phrygians
 Do not believe "frigians here mean Trojans
 aadhunik kalpana ke anusaar trogen horse, kuch had tak ghode jaisaa dikhne vaala ek diwaar todane vaala takhta hoga or uske upyog kaa vivaran puranic katha ke anusaar un maukhik itihaaskaaron dwaara badal diya gaya jo yuddh main maujuud nahin the or uske naam ke matlab se anjaan the
 At that time the Assyrians used animal names for siege organizations; So it is possible that the Trojan horse should be something like this
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki vastav main trogen horse kisi bukamp kaa ek rup ho jo ladaaiyon ke bich aayaa ho, jisane troy kii deevaaron ko kamazor kar unhen akraman ke liye khulaa chhod diya ho; devtaa posidon ne samudr, ghodon or bhukampon ke ishwar ke rup main tripaksheeya kaary kiya
 Structural damage on Troy VI - its location is similar to that shown in Homer's Elyad, and the artifacts found also indicate that it was a place of extraordinary trade and power - indicating that there must have been an earthquake indeed
 aam taur par troy viia ko homer kaa troy mana jaataa he
 There may also be a hint towards the Trojan cavalry of the Trojan horse Hector
 ho saktaa he ki dushman ne khud ko is ashwarohi sena tukdi ke rup main chipaaya ho or uski aadh main bina kisi poochtacha ke troy main le jaye gayi hon
 trogen horse kii is vyakhya kaa troy ke naataktray ke tisare bhaag main lekhak david yemel dwaara prayog kiya gaya he
 There is only one surviving classical depiction of the Trojan horse, a carving of the Maykonos pot
 yah aathvi shatabdi isa purv purana he, yuddh ke anumaanit samay se lagbhag 500 varsh pashchaat lekin paramparaagat taur par homer dwaara likhit vivaran se purv kaa he
 At the istanbul archaeological museum at da shalimann muzium in ankarshajan, germany From the movie troy a modran interpratation at da trosa-ostelang in stutgart, germany The simple meaning of the genre is type, variety, class or category
 yah shabd vividh prakaar kii rachanaaon ko varg yaa shrenee main baantne se us vidha ke gundharmo ko samajhane main suvidha hoti he
 This is similar to how organisms are classified in biology
 sahitya evam bhaashan main vidha shabd kaa prayog ek vargakaarak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 But in general it can be used for any art form
 vidhaon kii upavidhaayen bhi hoti hai
 For example, we say that the essay is a genre of prose
 
 The genres are ambiguous ranges and have no definite boundary line
 ye samay ke saath kuch manyataon ke aadhaar par inkii pahchaan nirmit ho jaati he
 Acharyas of Sanskrit literature have divided the entire literature into two parts - visual poetry and audio poetry
 drishy kavy main naatak hai
 Verse and prose are the two major distinctions of literature in Sravakavyavya
 drishykavy kaa chakshuon dwaara tathaa shravyakavy kaa shravanendirya dwaara rasaswadan kiya jaataa he
 Similar to Sanskrit literature, Hindi literature also has many forms of drama and poetry and prose: short story, story, novel, satire, travelogue, essay, memoir, sketch, reportage, diary, prose criticism and review
 in sabhi vidhaon main srujanaatmak tathaa vichaaratmak sahitya dirghakaal se nirantar vidwaanon dwaara likhaa ja rahaa he
 The major literary genres are- dream girl 1977 kii hindi film he jise pramod chakravarti ne nirdeshit kiya tha
 The lead actors of this film are Dharmendra, Hemamalini, Ashok Kumar and Prem Chopra
 preran kundali kam voltata vaale strot se ucch voltata praapt karanevaali ek yukti he
 It consists of two coils wrapped on one core, called primary and secondary
 praathmik kundali main dwitiyak kii apeksha bahut kam lapeten hoti hai
 This coil is connected to a battery by a switch
 yah switch sampark or viched prakaar kaa hota he, jisamen ek kamaani lagi rahati he
 The segmental tip has a malleable iron contact
 sansparshak kaa sira platinum dhaatu kaa bana hota he, jisase baar baar arq banane par bhi sansparshak khat na ho
 In general, this contactor contacts another stationary contactor and thus the circuit of the primary coil is completed and current flows in it
 dhara pravaahit hone se uske charon ore ek kshetra kii utpatti ho jaati he
 The secondary horoscope is also located in this region and is thus under its influence
 jab praathmik kundali kaa kshetra kaaphi bad jaataa he, tab switch ke narm lohe kaa sansparshak praathmik kundali ke crode kii ore aakarshith ho jaataa he
 The core is also made of soft iron
 sansparshak ke crode kii ore khinch jane ke karan, uskaa sthir sansparshak se sansparsh tut jaataa he; or is prakaar praathmik kundali kii dhara kaa paripath puraa nahin rahata
 Due to this, the current flowing in it stops
 vastav main dhara ekadam shunya nahin ho jaati, varan kundali ke prerakatv ke karan usamen kuch kaal kaa vilamb hota he
 The magnetic field generated by the current is also dissipated in this way
 parantu aisa hone par, narm lohe kaa sansparshak bhi, crode kaa aakarshan samaapt ho jane ke kaaran, apni puraani sthiti par phenk diya jaataa he
 With this, he starts contacting the static contact again
 is prakaar praathmik kundali kii dhara kaa paripath phir purna ho jaataa he or bydaree se dhara phir pravaahit hone lagati he
 This action continues again and again
 parinamswaroop, praathmik kundali kii dhara kaa paripath baar baar banataa or tuutata rahata he
 Due to this, the area generated by its current also keeps decreasing in recurring form
 is prakaar, abhivah bhi duusari kundali kii lapet ko aavarti rup main katata he or usamen vi

 kii utpatti ho jaati he
 Since these induced voltages are proportional to the wrap number of the two axes; Thus, even when the primary voltage is low, very high voltage is induced
 vichaarneey he ki yah kriya dhara ke ghatane or badhane ke kaaran hoti he; or yadhyapi bydaree se sthir maan kii disht dhara praapt hoti he, to bhi sampark viched switch ke dwaara use aavarti rup main pravaahit kiya ja saktaa he
 The primary and secondary coils are wrapped on the same core, ebonite or any other insulating tube, but they have no plan, either they are wrapped by enamelled wires, causing each other to be insulated; Or the secondary is wrapped with an insulating tube above the primary
 paripath ke baar baar banane or tuutane se donon sansparshakon ke bich arq utpann hota he
 Apart from this, there is also fear of fire, apart from the damage of contacts
 arq na hone dene ke liye paripath main ek sandharitra kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jaisaa chitra main dikhaaya gaya he
 The higher voltage in the secondary coil by induction does not mean that it increases the power
 vastav main dhara kaa maan usee anupaat main kam ho jaataa he
 Thus if 1 ampere current is being taken at 12 volts in the primary coil, then the secondary coil will have only ampere current at 1200 volts
 vastav main dwitiyak main dhara kaa maan ati alp hota he
 On the principle of induction coil only, there is an ignition coil in the trains
 usamen bhi kisi bydaree se praapt 6 yaa 12 volt kii voltata se dwitiyak kundali main kai hajaar volt kii voltata praapt kii jaati he, jo spark plag ke madhyam se petrol ke prajvalan ke liye aavashyak hoti he
 Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted on a unit of a surface in the Earth's atmosphere by the weight of air above it

 sampadak arni clen jon ko saptaah main do baar prakashit hone vaala ek kollam pradaan karte hai jisamen vah dainik jivan kii mjedaar baton or dosha par vichaar-vimarsh kar sake
 John, who initially brags for content, realizes that Marley's wicked exploits could become the perfect subject for his first creation

 In the 5th and 6th centuries AD, some insular Kelty speakers settled in northwestern France, and their speakers are still found in the Brittany peninsula and some other areas
 dweepiya kelti bhashaaon kii do upashakhaayen hai: Modeling in biology is the process of generating populations of genetically identical animals, which occur asexually by various organisms in nature, such as bacteria, pests, or plants
 jaev-praudyogiki main, pratirupan diene khandon, koshikaon yaa jeevon kii praturup nirmit karne kii prakriya ko kaha jaataa he
 The term also refers to the process of producing multiple copies of a product, such as a digital medium or software
 clon shabd κλών se liya gaya he, "tana, shakha" ke liye ek greek shabd, jo us prakriya ko suchit karata he, jiske dwaara ek tahani se koi nayaa paudha nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 In horticulture, the clon spelling was used until the twentieth century; The use of the last e began to indicate that the vowel is not a "short o", but a "long o"
 chunki is shabd ne lokapriy shabdkosh main ek adhik saamaanya sandarbh ke saath pravesh kiya, atah vartanee clone kaa prayog vishisht rup se kiya jaataa he
 Molecular modeling refers to the process of making multiple copies of a defined DNA sequence
 aksar pratirupan kaa prayog sampurna jin yukt diene khandon ke parivardhan ke liye kiya jaataa he, lekin iskaa prayog kisi bhi diene kram, jaise protsaahak, gaiyr-koding kram tathaa yadrichhik rup se vikhandit diene, ke parivardhan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 It is used in a wide range of biological experiments and practical applications, from genetic fingerprinting to large-scale protein production
 kabhi-kabhi pratirupan shabd kaa prayog kisi vishisht phenotip se jude kisi jin kii gunasutra-sambandhi sthiti bataane ke liye, jaise sthetiya pratirupan main, bhraamak rup se kiya jaataa he
 In practice, localizing a gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily provide the ability to isolate or enrich a specific relevant genomic sequence
 To augment any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be connected to the origin of the replica, which is a DNA sequence capable of directing the transmission of itself and any sequence associated with it
 
 haalanki, anya anek visheshtaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke visheshikrut pratirupan vectors uplabdh hai, jo protein abhivyakti, tanging, ekal reshon vaale RNA or diene utpaadan tathaa anya sanshodhano ke poshan kii anumati dete hai
 Modeling of a DNA segment necessarily involves four steps
 haalanki ye charan vibhinn pratirupan vidhiyon main samaan hote hai, tathaapi anek vaikalpik margon kaa chayan kiya ja saktaa he, jinhen "pratirupan ranneeti" ke rup main sankshepit kiya gaya he
 Initially, there is a need to isolate the DNA of our interest, so that a DNA block of appropriate size can be provided
 Next, the tying method is used, in which this amplified segment is inserted into a vector
 is vector ko, pratibandh enzim kaa prayog karke sidhaa kiya jaataa he or upyukt sthitiyon ke antargat diene liges naamak enzim ke saath hamaari ruchi ke khand ke saath incubet kiya jaataa he
 After binding, the vector containing the insertion of our interest is transfected into cells

 Modern modeling vectors include selective antibiotic resistance markers, which allow the addition of only those cells in which the vector has been transfected
 Additionally, impersonation vectors may also have color-selective markers, which provide blue / white screening on the X-gal medium
 phir bhi, in charnon kaa chayan is baat kii puri guarantee nahin detaa ki praapt koshikaon main diene pravishti upasthit he
 It is necessary to further inspect the resulting settlements to confirm that the impersonation was successful
 aisa PCR, pratibandh khand ke vishleshan tathaa / yaa diene kraman ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Modeling of a cell means obtaining a population of cells from a single cell
 In unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, this process is characteristically simple and essentially involves transmitting only the appropriate medium
 haalanki bahu-kosiya jeevon se praapt parivardhan kii sthiti main, koshikaon kaa pratirupan ek kathin kaary hota he kyonki ye koshikaayen maanak madhyam main saraltapurvak viksit nahin hongi

 In horticulture, the term model is used to refer to all the descendants of a plant, which originated from vegetative reproduction or apomixis
 Many species of horticultural plants are replicas, which were obtained from a single plant and their numbers have been increased by any process other than sexual reproduction

 Artificial modeling of organisms can also be called reproducible modeling
 genetic taur par abhinn pashuon ke nirmaan ke liye prajananeey pratirupan aamtaur par "daihik koshika parmaanu hastantaran" kaa prayog karata he
 This process involves transferring the nucleus from a donor adult cell to a nucleus-less egg
 yadi anda saamaanya rup se vibhajit ho jaae, to ise pratinidhi maa ke garbhashay main sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he
 Such patterns are not completely homogenous because there may be some changes in the nucleus DNA of the somatic cell

 The success rate per fertilized egg was low in the modeling of dolly sheep; He was born after the use of 237 eggs to develop 29 embryos, which gave birth to only three lambs and only one of them survived
 Seventy calves have been produced by 9,000 attempts and one third of them died at an early age; Had to try 328 times for the promotion
 Notably, although the earliest replicated organisms were frogs, no frogs have yet been generated from somatic adult nucleus donor cells
 prarambh main daawey kiye gaye the ki doli bhed main tezi se umr badhane jaise lakshan the
 Scientists speculate that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to a lack of telomere, a dna-protein group protecting linear chromosomes from termination

 Some people have given the idea to develop organs separately from the human organism - by doing so a new organ supply can be established without the ethical problems associated with producing them from humans
 Research is also being conducted into the idea of developing human organs acceptable to other organisms, such as the pig or cow's body, and then transplanting them into humans, which is a form of upper-transplantation

 Since a normal fetus is transplanted on day 14, act's director of tissue engineering, Dr
 Robert Lanza, told the Daily Mail newspaper that the fetus cannot be seen as a person before 14 days
 According to the ACT, when developing embryos that, if allowed to grow for the required duration, could develop into a complete human being: "the goal was 'therapeutic modeling', not 'reproductive modeling'
