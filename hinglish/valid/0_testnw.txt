 yah ek pashchim jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-sexn england main hui thi
 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the Norman Conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, for which Norman vocabulary and spelling rules were heavily used
 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language
 angreji bhashaa kaa kaam chalau gyaan anek kshetron, jaise kii chikitsa or computer, ke liye ek aavashyaktaa ban chukaa he; parinamswaroop ek arab se zyada log kam se kam buniyadi str kii angreji bol lete hai

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands
 in jarmenic janajatiyon main se ek thi engles, jo sambhawatah angton se aaye the

 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain
 inamen se ek boli, let west sexn, antat apana varchasv sthapit karne main safal hui
 mul puraani angrezi bhashaa phir akraman kii do laharon se prabhavit hui

 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world
 paanchavin or chhathi sadi main britain ke dwipon par uttar kii ore se angel or sexn qabeelon ne hamalaa kiya tha or unhone keltic bhashaayen bolne vaale sthaneey logon ko scotland, ireland or wales kii ore dhakel diya tha
 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise â dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date

 This period of English continued from 1100 to 1500 and this period of English expansion is called medieval English

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 The former is sometimes called BBC English, a clan noted for its inclination towards "received pronunciation"; It follows the Cambridge model
 yah model europe, africa bhartiya upmahadweep or anya kshetron jo kii yaa to british rashtramandal se prabhavit hai yaa phir america ke saath pahachanakrut hone ke unicchuk hai, main anya bhashaaon ko bolne waalon ko angreji sikhaane ke liye ek maanak ke taur par kaam karti he
 The latter dialect, General American, extends to most of the United States and Canada

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 paaramparik prakaaron ke uccharan, vyakaran or shabd bhandar angreji kii anya kismon se bhinn, kabhi kabhaar baari maatra main, hai
 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker
 kshetreey lahazon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye 'angreji ke kshetreey lahazon' ko dekhen or kshetreey boliyon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye angreji bhashaa kii boliyon kii soochi ko dekhen

 Here * means to mark those vowels which are not in the sound system of Hindi, or which most Indians are not able to pronounce properly
 angreji ek intonaton bhashaa he
 This means that the fluctuation of speech is used according to the situation
 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable
 newclear shabdaansh vaktaa ke mukhya bindu kaa varnan karata he
 for example: yah bhi It can also be used to express emotion: newclear shabdaanshon ko zyada unche swar main bolaa jaataa he or inako bolne ke lahaze main ek vishisht badlaav hota he
 The most common variations of this tone are the raising of the voice and lowering of the voice, although the falling voice and the falling sound are also used occasionally
 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "point of view" and a rising voice means "point of view"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Where symbols are visual in pairs, the first corresponds to the common American pronunciation of American English, the second corresponds to the received pronunciation of British English
 yah angreji vyanjan pranali he jo antarrashtriya dhvanyatmak varnmaala se pratikon kaa prayog kar rahi he
 Speech and aspirations of stop consonants in English depend on dialect and context, but only a few general rules can be given: anya indo-european bhashaaon kii tulana main angreji main nunatam mode hote hai
 For example, modern English, unlike modern German or Dutch and romance languages, lacks gender grammar and adjective agreement
 cese marking bhashaa se lagbhag gaayab ho chuki he or aaj iskaa istemaal mukhya rup se sarvnaam main hi kiya jaataa he
 The form of strong versus weak verbs derived from Germanic origin has gained importance in modern English and the use of curved remains has increased
 varttman main bhashaa adhik vishleshnatmakaban gayi he or arth spasht karne ke liedyotak kriya or shabd kram jaise sadhano kaa vikaas hua he
 Auxiliary verbs denote questions, negativity, passive voice and progressive aspects
 chunki angrezi ek germanik bhashaa he, uski adhiktar dainik upyog kii shabdaawalee pracheen german se aayi he
 Apart from this, there are many negative words in English

 proto-indo-european se nikali anek bhashaaon kii tarah angreji ke sabase aam shabdon ke mul ko PIE main khoja ja saktaa he
 These words include basic pronouns such as "I, from the Old English word ic, m, numbers", duo, tris), common family relationships such as mother, father, brother, sister etc
, many animal names and many common Activities jarmenic shabd angreji ke latin shabdon se zyada chote hote hai or saamaanya bolchaal main inkaa upyog zyada aam he
 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue
 jorj orwell kaa niabandh "raajnneeti or angreji" is cheez or bhashaa ke anya kathith durupayogon kii aalochana karata he
 This essay is considered an important review of the English language

 kuch maamalon main, ek jarmenic vyutpann shabd, ek latin vyutpann shabd or samaan latin shabd se vyutpann ek french shabd main se chayan karne kaa vikalp rahata he
 These synonyms, incorporating diverse meanings and nuances, help the speakers to express nuances and differences of views

 That is, the noun of meat is usually different and unrelated to the noun of the animal it provides
 jaanavar kaa aamtaur par jarmenic naam hota he or gosht kaa french se vyutpann hota he
 Examples, deer and venison; Cow and Beef; Pigs / Pig and Pork, and Sheep and Mutton

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface

 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English

 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Camcorders have three major components: lens, imager and recorder
 The lens collects and focuses light on the imager
 imager ek vidyut sanket main ghatit prakaash ko parivartit karata he
 Finally, the recorder converts the electrical signal in the video and encodes it in an accumulated form

 Bangladesh's freedom struggle took place in 1971, it is also called 'freedom struggle'
 yah yuddh varsh 1971 main 25 march se 16 disambar tak chalaa tha
 Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan through this bloody war
 16 disambar san 1971 ko bangladesh bana tha
 This historic victory of India over Pakistan is celebrated as Victory Day

 India forced 93,000 Pakistani soldiers to kneel
 1971 ke pehle bangladesh, pakistan kaa ek praant tha jiskaa naam 'purvi pakistan' tha jabaki vartmaan pakistan ko pashchimi pakistan kehete the
 The people of East Pakistan took to the streets in protest against many years of struggle and atrocities of the Pakistan Army and suppression of the Bangladeshi
 1971 main azaadi ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye pakistani sena ne purvi pakistan ke vidroh par amada logon par jamkar atyaachaar kiye
 Millions of people were killed and countless women were looted
 bharat ne padosi ke naate is julm kaa virodh kiya or krantikariyon kii madad kii
 As a result, there was a direct war between India and Pakistan

 With this, a new country emerged in South Asia

 Thus the social and economic disparities found in two parts of the same country and the tendency of enlightened people to control the power itself led to nationwide dissatisfaction and finally the formation of Bangladesh in 1971
 pakistan ke gathan ke samay pashchimi kshetra main sindhi, pathan, baloch or mujahiron kii badi sankhya thi, jabaki purv hisse main bengali bolne waalon kaa bahumat tha
 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, but the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected
 isse purvi pakistan ke logon main jabardast naaraazgi thi
 And to take political advantage of this resentment, Bangladesh leader Sheikh mujib-ur-rehman formed Awami League and demanded more autonomy within Pakistan
 1970 main hue aam chunaav main purvi kshetra main shaikh kii party ne jabardast vijay hasil kii
 His party also won a majority in Parliament but instead of making him Prime Minister, he was put in jail

 On 25 March 1971, there was a massive massacre in this part of Pakistan under the leadership of the army and police
 isse pakistani sena main kaam kar rahe purvi kshetra ke nivaasiyon main jabardast rosh hua or unhone alag mukti vahini bana lee
 The Pakistani military continued to persecute innocent, weaponless people

 Before becoming Bangladesh, the Pakistani military in East Pakistan violated human rights with the help of local leaders and religious extremists
 25 march 1971 ko shuru hue oparation search lite se lekar puure bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan purvi pakistan main jamkar hinsa hui
 According to the Bangladesh government, around 3 million people died during this period

 At the behest of the Pakistan Army, the Razakars, Al Shams and Al Badr tortured Bengali-speaking minorities and Bengali-speaking Muslims in erstwhile East Pakistan and fiercely violated human rights
 unke dwaara kiye gayi amanviya atyaachaar ke pramaan aaj tak bangladesh me samuhik kabron ke rup me milte rahe hai | After the massacres in erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971, several mass graves have been built, which have been known till date

 Massacres were carried out in all the areas from where opposition was feared
 Even people were taken out of the houses and fryed with bullets
 1971 main purvi pakistan main lakhon mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, atyaachaar kiya gaya or hatya kii gayi
 According to an estimate, such excesses were made with about four lakh such women, who committed acts of forced sexual relations with them, women in military cant as sex workers etc
 and acts like gang rape
 563 bengali mahilaon ko kaint ilaake main kar rakhaa tha kaidaladai ke pehle hi din se 563 bengali mahilaon ko dhaka ke dingi military kaint main kaid kar diya gaya tha
 Pakistani army soldiers used to commit excesses with these women

 The entry of these refugees into India and the economic pressure on India due to this weight is also considered to be a reason behind interfering in this battle of India
 bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan mukti vahini kaa gathan pakistan sena ke atyaachaar ke virodh main kiya gaya tha
 In 1969, discontent grew in East Pakistan against Pakistan's then military ruler General Ayub and was at its peak in 1970 during the movement of Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
 mukti vahini ek chhapamar sanghathan tha, jo pakistani sena ke khilaaf gorilla yuddh lard rahaa tha

 The SWAT is a strategic unit of an elite paramilitary special operation in the US and some international law enforcement departments
 unhen ucch jokhim ko sanchaalan karne kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he jo niyamit rup se adhikariyon kii kshamta se baahar hota he
 Their duties include hostage rescue and counter-terrorism operations, service of high risk arrest and search warrants, mobilization against suspects and apprehending heavily armed criminals etc
 SWAT team ke paas aksar vishesh hathiyaar hote hai jisamen hamalon ke liye riflein, tami bandooken, shotgans, karbaine, danga niyantran agent, achet karne vaale hathgole or ghaat main baithkar nishaanaa saadhane waalon ko maarane ke liye ucch kshamta vaali banduken shaamil he
 They also have specialized equipment that includes heavy body armor, insertion devices, armored vehicles, advanced night vision optics and detector detectors to determine the position of hostages hidden inside or carrying hostages inside enclosed structures 
 sabase pehle 1968 main los angeles police vibhaag main SWAT team ko sthapit kiya gaya tha
 Since then many US police departments, especially in large cities and at the federal and state levels of government, have their specific units set up under different names, these units are collectively referred to as SWAT teams under common colloquialisms, regardless of their official name
 Is specified in the form
 apni aadhunik avatar main SWAT ke vikaas ke liye aam taur par los angeles police vibhaag ke inspector darryl gates ke sandarbh ke saath isaki shuruyaat hoti he
 After the introduction of the LAPD SWAT team, Gates wrote in his autobiography Chief: My Life in the LAPD that he did not develop the SWAT strategy and its specific tools
 gates ne likhaa he ki unhone sankalpana kaa samarthan kiya tha or is sankalpana ko viksit karne ke liye apane logon ko samarth banane kii koshish kii or unka naitik samarthan kiya
 Gates originally named the platoon a "special Violence Assault Team" but changed the name to his boss and Deputy Police Chief Ed Davis after the general public protests made him feel like a military organization
 or ek parivarni shabd "SWAT" ko rakhana chaahate the, gates ne iske vistaar ko "special vipans and tactice" main badla
 While the public side of SWAT is known to have been produced through LAPD, perhaps because of their proximity to mass media and the size and professionalism of their department, the first SWAT operation was in the farming community of Delano, California, north of Los Angeles, with Kern and Operations were carried out on the great San Joaquin Valley in the middle of the border of Tulare Counties
 united farm workars ke sah-sansthaapak sesar shavej, delano main cold storage suvidhaon or gaiyr sahaayak krishi mazdooron ke gharon ke saamne shahar ke sadakon par lagaataar virodh pradarshan kar rahe the
 The Delano Police Department first tried to resolve the issue by the Special Violence and Tactics Unit set up
 televijan samachar steshnon or print media dwaara in ghatnaon ke taaja or vilambit rup se vistrut-soochna desh bhar main pahunchaaya gaya tha
 LAPD staff watched the broadcast and then contacted Delano PD and also inquired about the program
 uske baad yahaan ke kisi ek adhikari ko delano police vibhaag ke vishesh hathiyaar or ranneeti koshal ko dekhne kii anumati mili thi or usne vahaan se jo kuch bhi siikhaa tha use lekar vah waapas los angeles aayaa or baad main usee gyaan kaa istemaal karte hue unhone pehali SWAT ikai ke rup main nirmaan kiya
 The idea of a specially trained and equipped unit in the LAPD was put forward by police to respond to a response by an officer named John Nelson and handle critical situations and reduce critical casualties by police
 inspector gates ne is vichaar ko manjuuri di or unhone vishesh adhikariyon ke ek chote samooh kaa gathan kiya
 Initially the first SWAT unit included fifteen teams of four people each for a total strength of sixty
 in adhikariyon ko vishesh darja or laabh diya gaya
 It was necessary to attend their special monthly training
 naagarik ashaanti ke dauraan yah ikai police kii suvidha ke liye ek suraksha ikai ke rup main bhi kaary karata tha
 LAPD SWAT units were organized as "D platoon" in the metro category
 1974 main los angeles police vibhaag dwaara jari kiye gaye simbyonij libration army ke saath ek muthbhed ke baad report jari kii gai thi, jisane swat itihaas, sanchaalan or sanghathan ke sambandh main vibhaag dwaara kuch pehle ke khaaton main se kuchhek ko pradaan karata he
 On page 100 of the report, the department mentions four trends that represent the development of SWAT
 isamen wat dange, jo 1960 ke dashak main samrik paristhitiyon main kritrim police vibhaag ko majaboor kiya jiske liye ve taiyaar nahin the, rajnatik aadesh ke chunauti ke rup main nishanchi kaa udbhav, raajnneetik hatyare kii upasthiti or shahari aatankwaadi guton dwaara gorilla yuddh kaa khatra shaamil he
 "the uncertainty of the sniper and the general response of the police increased the likelihood of predictive death or injury to officers
 Casualties between traditional officers with gorilla-trained terrorist factions led to higher casualties among officers while gorillas survived
 Chances were high
 report main ullekh kiya gaya ki shahari hinsa kii sharton ke tahat in se nipatane ke liye LAPD ne SWAT kaa gathan kiya
 The 109-page report states "the purpose of SWAT is to provide protection to police operations in the event of rescue, aid, security, fire power and greater personal risk, where it is necessary to minimize casualties under special tactics
" " On February 7, 2008, a member of the LAPD SWAT team was killed in Winnetka, California, for the first time in the last 41 years in an enclosure and subsequent fire with a gunman
 SWAT kartavyon main shaamil hai: The first significant deployment of the LAPD SWAT unit took place on 9 December 1969 in a four-hour confrontation with members of the Black Panthers
 is muthbhed main teen panthars or teen adhikari ghayal hue the auki antat panthars ne aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 By 1974 SWAT had received general approval as a resource for the city and county of Los Angeles
 ek samooh jise simbyonij libration army kaha jaataa he, ke baari hathiyaaron se las vampanthi gorillaon ek samooh ne 17 may 1974 kii dopaher ko los angeles main crompton avenue ke 54 east street ke ek ghar main apane aap ko band kar liya tha
 
 Detailed information about the siege was broadcast to millions of people through TV and radio and a day later it was published in newspapers around the world
 ansu gas kii shuruuaat ke pehle or baad main kai avasaron par chupe hue sandigdhon se samjhauta vaarta chaalu tha
 Police units did not start firing until the SLA started bombarding them with semi-automatic and automatic guns
 SLA dwaara 3,772 round ke golibari karne ke baavjood isse koi asambaddha naagarik or police adhikari anwarat goliyon se chotil nahin hua tha
 Fire erupted inside the residence during the gun fight
 aadhikarik taur par aag lagane kaa kaaran to agyaat he, haalanki police sutron ke anumaan ke anusaar ek sandigdh dwaara galat rup se molotove cocktels ke phenkane se aag lagi thi
 According to another estimate, the reason for the fire was the frequent use of tear gas grenades, which began to ignite by chemical water at high temperatures
 or sabhi chah sandigdhon ko ekaadhik bandook kii goli ke ghaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or antat nivas sthaan main lage aag main sabhi aatankwaadi maare gaye
 At the time of SLA shooting, the SWAT team reorganized six teams of 10 men each into two teams of five personnel each, called an element
 is element main ek element senapati, do akraman karne vaale, ek paharedaar or ek sena ke prishth bhaag kaa rakshak tha
 They normally have a sniper rifle, two in arms
 223-calibur arddh swachaalit riflein or do bandooken thim
 SWAT officers also placed their service revolvers in the shoulder bag
 saamaanya upkarnon main unhen ek praathmik chikitsa kit, dastaane or ek gas mask diya gaya tha
 In fact it was changed and the police were given to keep semi-automatic rifles but there was a time when usually six bullet revolvers and guns were given to them
 simbyonij libration army ke saath muthbhed ke baad SWAT tiimon kii disha main sharir kavach or vibhinn prakaar ke swachaalit hathiyaaron ke jari karne kii ek pravriti ne janm liya
 The Columbine High School massacre in Colorado on 20 April 1999 was another influential incident for SWAT tactics and police retaliation
 chrischian science monitor ek lekh main is baat kaa ullekh kiya gaya ki "SWAT team ke pahunchane kaa intjaar karne kaa sikhaane ke bajaay un ghatnaon jisamen sandigdh ke paas khatarnaak hathiyaar hone kaa andeshaa ho vaise ghatnaon main kshetreey adhikariyon ko tatkaal karrwai karne or hathiyaar prashikshan dene chahie
 The article further states that field officers have increasing weapons and rifles and heavy weapons and ballistic helmets are being issued and these weapons are traditionally associated with SWAT units
 kshetreey adhikariyon ke tathaa kathith active-shooter sthitiyon main teji se ection lene ke liye is vichaar ko rakhaa gaya he
 Under such conditions, waiting for SWAT by setting only one perimeter was not acceptable
 ek udhaaharan ke rup main minnapolis, minesota, police vibhaag kii niti or minial prakriya main yah kaha gaya he ki "MPD karmi is tathy se avgat rahe ki kai sakriy shooter kii ghatnaon main ghatana ke shuruaati minuton main kuch nirdosh jivan kii kshati hoti he
 
 This fact shows that to save the lives of innocent people in some situations, it is necessary to handle the situation quickly and take swift action
 " Following this change in police retaliation, SWAT units will be required to perform their traditional roles as hostage rescue, counter-terrorism operations and serving high risk warrants
 apekshaakrit SWAT kaa antaraal yukt aamantran kaa arth he ki badi laagat main inhen prashikshan kiya gaya he or susajjit adhikari ek apaat sthiti ke liye pratiksha karke yun hi baithe nahin rahete
 kai vibhaagon ke adhikariyon ko saamaanya rup se niyamit rup se kaam ke liye tainaat kiye gaye hai lekin pegers, mobile phone yaa radio transrisiver dwaara SWAT kol ke liye uplabdh hote hai
 Even in large police agencies such as the Los Angeles PD, SWAT personnel are typically seen in crime suppression roles, more dangerous than specialized and routine watchdogs, but in this type of campaign, officers may be able to use their specific weapons and Cannot carry tools
 iskaa udhaaharan LAPD ke website se pataa chalata he ki 2003 main 133 SWAT kol ke liye unke SWAT ikaiyaan 255 baar sakriy the or 122 baar unhone ucchtam jokhim warrant kii seva kii thi
 The Emergency Service Unit of The New York Police Department is one of the Civilian Police special-charge Units operating 24 hours autonomously

 a long gap is created between the initial emergency and the deployment of the actual SWAT at the required location, in calling for the scattered personnel, then distributing weapons, and explaining the plan
 1999 ke kaalambin hai skool kii shooting main police kii javaabi karrwai main deree kii samasyaon ke chalate police kii pratikriya main parivartan ho gaya, mukhya rup se rekha ke adhikariyon ke paridhi ko sthapit karne or SWAT ke aane kaa intjaar karne ke bajaae unki tainaati ek sakriy shooter se nipatane ke liye honi chahie thi
 SWAT officers are selected by volunteers in their law enforcement organization
 vibhaag kii niti ke aadhaar par, aam taur par adhikariyon ko visheshgy anubhag jaise SWAT ke liye prayog main aane se pehle vibhaag ke bheetar ek nunatam kaarykaal tak seva karnaa hota he
 The demand for this term is based on the fact that SWAT officers are still law enforcement officers and must have an in-depth knowledge of the department's policies and procedures
 SWAT ke aavedakon ko kathor chayan or prashikshan se guzarana padataa he
 Applicants also have to pass rigorous physical fitness, written, oral and psychological tests to ensure that they are not only physically fit enough, but also psychologically fit for strategic operation
 shaareerik fitness par kaaphi jor diya jaataa he taaki ek adhikari ranneetik karrwai kii kathorta ko jhelane main sakasham ho
 After an officer is elected, the prospective member is required to undergo several specialist courses and pass, which makes him a fully qualified SWAT operator
 adhikariyon ko nishanebaaji main sateek shooting kaushal ke vikaas ke liye prashikshit kiya jaataa he
 Other training offered to prospective members includes training in explosives, sniper-training, defensive strategy, first aid, negotiation, handling of K9 units, including repelling and roping techniques and using specialized weapons and equipment

 isa, islam ke un 25 pegambaron main se ek hai, jinka ullekh quran main kiya gaya he
 According to Islamic theology, Jesus is placed second most important after Muhammad
 bible main die gaye unki aatmakatha se jude lagbhag sari daivi ghatnaon ko islam main mana jaataa he, jisamen: kunvarigarbha se janm, unke chamatkaar, unke cross par chadhaay jane, mrityu or mritotthana shaamil hai
 However, according to some verses of the Quran, crucifixion, death and resurrection were not genuine incidents
 baharhaal, masihiyon ke viruddh muslmaan, isa ko ishvarputra yaa trimurtitv ko nahin maanate
 In Islam, Jesus is considered a venerable prophet who God sent to Israel to spread his message
 quran ke anusaar, allaah ne isa ko inzel namak pavitra kitaab kaa ilhaam diya tha, joki islamic manyata ke anusaar, allaah dwaara maanavtaa ko pradaan kiye gaye chaar pavitra kitabon main se ek he
 The name of Jesus in the Quran is more than that of Muhammad, and Mussulman is believed to have been born by the virgin mother of Jesus
 islam main isa messiah sabhi nabiyon kii tarah hi mahaz ek nashwar insaan mana jaataa he, or isai manyata kii tarah, ishwar-putr yaa trimurti kaa sadsy nahin mana jaataa he, or unki puja par manaahi he
 He got the ability to perform miracles from God and such powers were not present in Jesus himself
 yah bhi nahin mana jaataa he ki ve cross par latake
 According to Islamic tradition, he was raised directly to heaven by God, despite dying on the cross
 sab nabiyon kii tarah, isa messiah bhi quran main ek muslim kehalaae gaye hai
 According to the Quran, Jesus never considered himself a God-son and would deny this on the Day of Judgment
 musulmaanon kii manyata he ki qayamat ke din par, isa messiah prithvi par laut aaenge or nyaay qayaam karenga
 In the hadiths of Muhammad, "all prophets are brothers and Christ is my closest brother because no prophet has come between me and Jesus"
 quran main isa kaa naam 25 baar aayaa he
 There is a story of his birth in Surah Maryam and similarly in Surah Ali Imran
 quran main isa kaa zikr, mohammad se bhi adhik he
 The crucifixion, death and return of Jesus is very important in Islam
 Most Muslims do not accept his death and return
 musalamaanon kii badi sankhya kaa maananaa he ki quran kii in aayaton main, jinamein messiah kii mrityu kaa ullekh he, vah keval bamuhaavara he
 Adhinash Ulema states that Christ was not crucified, but was taken up in paradise
 jabaki kuch anya ulema kaa maananaa he ki unako mrityu ke baad, ishwar dwaara punah jivit kiya gaya or phir jananath le jaaya gaya
 But it is agreed upon by all Muslim ulema that Christ will come back to earth at the appointed time, and will implement Islam on earth according to God's will

 sahavrudhdi Symbolism is an abnormality of the teeth in which the cementum of 2 teeth is connected to the roots
 In this case, the roots of 2 teeth join to each other, thereby filling the space between the teeth
 With this abnormality, the genus of 2 teeth becomes 1 and if there is any problem in 1 tooth, then it becomes a solution to remove both the teeth at that time
 This condition is seen in the upper teeth, which can occur in both primary and pucca teeth
 This is a very rare problem and is only visible at the time of teeth removal

 phuffus karkat rog phuffus yaa fefden kaa cancer ek aakraamak, vyapak, kathor, kutil or ghaatak rog he jisamen fefde ke utakon kii aniyantrit sanvruddhi hoti he
 90% -95% of lung cancers originate from the epithelial cells of the small and large respiratory tracts
 isiilie ise bronchogenic karcinoma bhi kehete hai
 Cancer arising from the pleura is called mesothelioma
 fefde ke cancer kaa sthalaantar bahut teji hota he yani yah bahut jaldi failata he
 Although it can spread to any part of the body
 yah bahut jaanaleva rog mana jaataa he
 Its treatment is also very difficult
 hamaara shwasan tantra nasika se shuru hokar fefdon main sthit vayukoshon tak failaa hua he
 The lungs are conical in shape from the top and broad at the bottom
 chaati ke do tihaai hisse main samaae fefde spanj kii tarah lacheele hote hai
 Breathing from the nose reaches the respiratory tract via the larynx and pharynx
 gardan ke neeche chaati main yah pehle daayen-baayein do bhaagon main vibhajit hoti he or ped kii shakhaon-prashakhaon kii tarah satraa-atharah baar vibhajit hokar shwasan vriksh banaati he
 Even the respiratory tree is called air conductor zone
 isaki antim shakha jo ki terminal brankiol kehalaati he, vah bhi 5-6 baar vibhajit hokar uski antim shakha pandrah se bees vayukoshon main khulti he
 The air sacs appear like gangrene
 terminal brankiol se vayukoshon tak kaa hissaa shwasan kriya ko sampann karne main apni mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 This is called the respiratory zone
 shwaas nalee ke is vriksh kii sabhi shakhaon-prashakhaon ke saath rakt laane or le jane vaali rakt vahiniyaan bhi hoti hai
 There is such a thin covering between these air sacs and the circulating microscopic blood vessels that swell and inhale when inhaled, that oxygen and carbon dioxide are easily and easily blinked
 pulmonary dhamni hriday se ashuddh rakt fefde tak laati he or vayukoshon main shuddh hua rakt choti shiraaon se pulmoronary shira ke madhyam se punah hriday tak pahunch jaataa he
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in both men and women
 san 2010 main america main is cancer ke 222,520 naye rogi mili or 157,300 rogiyon kii mrityu hui
 According to the National Cancer Institute, one in every 14 women and men has lung cancer at some time in their life
 fefde kaa cancer praayah vriddhavastha kaa rog he
 About 70% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis, just 3% of patients are younger than 45 years
 1930 se pehle yah rog bahut kam hota tha
 But as the prevalence of smoke smoking increased, the prevalence of this disease increased dramatically
 in dinon kai deshon main dhumrapaan nishedh sambandhi swasthya-shiksha, prachaar or saarvajanik sthanon par dhumrapaan nishedh ke kade niyamon ke kaaran is cancer kii vyapaktaa main giravat ai he
 Yet lung cancer remains the biggest cause of death in both men and women all over the world
 cigarette kaa dhumrapaan fefde ke cancer kaa sabase bada kaaran he
 It has been observed that 90% of the patients of this cancer definitely consume tobacco
 fefde ke cancer kaa jokhim is baat par nirbhar karata he ki vah din bhar main kitni cigarette peetaa he or kitne samay se cigarette pi rahaa he
 This allows the physician to calculate the pack year of the patient's smoking history
 maan lijiye koi vyakti 10 varsh se cigarette ke 2 packet roj pi rahaa he to uskaa dhumrapaan itihaas 20 pack-year hua
 a person with a history of smoking 10 pack-years is also at risk for lung cancer, but a risk of lung cancer at 30 pack-years is very high
 2 packet se zyada sirgaret pine vaale 14% log fefde ke cancer se marate hai
 Those who smoke beedi, pipes and cigars have a five times higher risk of lung cancer than those who do not smoke
 jabaki cigarette pine waalon main yah jokhim 25 guna adhik hota he
 Tobacco contains 400 carcinogenic substances including nicotine, chief among which are nitrosamines and polycystic aromatic hydrocarbons
 cigarette chhodane waalon ke liye ek acchhee khabar yah he ki cigarette chhodane ke baad cancer kaa jokhim saal dar saal kam hota jaataa he or 15 varsh baad unke baraabar ho jaataa he jinhone kabhi cigarette pi hi nahin he
 Because new cells start forming in their lungs and old ones are destroyed
 dhumrapaan karne waalon ke saath rahane vaale yaa unke saath lambaa samay bitaane vaale logon main bhi is cancer kaa jokhim saamaanya vyaktiyon se 24% adhik hota he
 In the US, 3000 patients die of lung cancer every year in this category
 asbestus kai prakaar ke khanij siliketon ke reshon ko kehete hai
 It is used in many industries due to its antitumor and anti-insulating properties
 yahan saans lene se ye reshe fefdon main pahunch jate hai or ekatrit hote rahete hai
 The risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma among people working in these industries is 5 times higher than normal people
 yadi ye dhumrapaan bhi karte hai to jokhim 50-90 guna ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the use of asbestos has been banned or limited in most industries these days
 redan ek prakritik, adrushya, gandhhin evam niskriy gas he jo uranium ke vighatan se banati he
 Dissolution of uranium produces several products, including radon, which release ionizing radiation
 lekin redan ek gyaat cancerkari he or america main fefde ke cancer ke 2 xxrep 4 0 logon kii mrityu ke liye jimmedaar he
 That is, radon is the second major cause of lung cancer
 redan gas jameen ke andar failati rahati he or gharon kii neenv, naaliyon, pipon aadi main padi daraaron se gharon main pravesh kar jaati he
 The amount of radon in one out of every 15 households in the US is estimated to be dangerously high
 bharat ke bhi adhikansh ilaakon main redan kii sthiti chintajanak he
 Some lung diseases like TB, COPD The presence of Adi also increases the risk of cancer
 gadiyon, udyogon or urja ikaayiyon se niklaa dhunaa or pradooshan bhi fefde ke kaisar kaa jokhim badhaata he
 a recent study has indicated that the close relationship of a lung cancer patient is relatively high in lung cancer risk
 fefde kaa cancer ko mukhyatah do prajati ke hote he
 1- Small cell cancer and 2- Non small cell cancer
 yah vargeekaran cancer kii sookshm sanrachana ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 Both these types of cancer also have different growth, relocation and treatment
 isliye bhi yah vargeekaran jaruri mana gaya he
 20% of lung cancers are small cell cancer species
 yah bahut aakraamak hota hai or badi teji se failata he
 It is always from smoking
 small cell cancer ke sirf 1% rogi hi dhumrapaan nahin karne vaale hote hai
 It rapidly transfers to the remote organs of the body
 praayah nidaan ke samay bhi ye sharir ke kai hisson main fail chukaa hota he
 It is also called oat cell carcinoma due to its distinct microstructure
 sabase vyapak prajati he
 80% of lung cancers are non-small cell cancer species
 inhen sookshm sanrachana ke aadhaar par nimna up-prajatiyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 It is the most widespread subcaste
 yah dhumrapaan se sambandhit he lekin dhumrapaan nahin karne waalon ko bhi ho saktaa he
 It usually occurs in the outer part of the lungs
 is upjati main ek vishesh tarah kaa bronkioalaviolar carcinoma bhi shaamil kiya gaya he jo fefde main kai jagah utpann hota he or vaayu koshon kii bhittiyon ke sahare failata he
 Earlier adenocarcinoma was more widespread, but nowadays the prevalence of this species has reduced to 30% of adenocarcinoma
 ise epidermoid carcinoma bhi kehete hai
 It is usually produced by a respiratory pipe in the middle of the lungs
 ise avibhedit carcinoma bhi kehete hai
 It is the least found
 kabhi-kabhi is upjati ke kai cancer saath bhi paye ja sakate hai
 In addition to the above two main species in the lungs, there can be other types of cancer
 inaki vyapaktaa 5-10 % hoti he
 5% of lung cancers are of this species
 nidaan ke samay yah arbud praayah chota rahata he or rogi kii umr 40 varsh se kam hoti he
 It is not related to smoking
 kai baar yah arbud hormone jaise padaarth kaa srav karata he jisase kuch vishesh lakshan dekhe jate hai
 It grows and spreads slowly, so there are adequate treatment options at the time of diagnosis
 
 The original cancer cells of many organs of the body can reach the lungs by moving blood vessels or lymph vessels and produce cancer at different times
 sameep ke angon se to cancer koshikaayen chal kar sidhi fefde main pahanch sakati hai
 In external cancer, many tumors often form on the outer part of the lung
 is rog main vividh prakaar ke lakshan hote hai jo arbud kii sthiti or sthalaantar par nirbhar karte hai
 Cancer does not usually have obvious and severe symptoms in its early stages
 fefde ke cancer ke 25% rogiyon kaa nidaan kisi anya prayojan se karawaaye gayi eksre yaa si
tii scan se hota he
 Often a shadow in the shape of a coin in an x-ray or whistle indicates cancer
 aksar in rogiyon ko isse koi lakshan nahin hota he
 Respiratory obstruction occurs due to the growth of tumors and its spread in the lungs, which can cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, wheezing, chest pain, coughing and bleeding
 yadi arbud kisi naadee kaa abhibhakshan kar letaa he to kandhe main dard jo baanh ke prishth bhaag tak fail jaataa he yaa dhwani yantra main lakve ke kaaran aawaaj main karkashta aa jaati he
 If the tumor has invaded the food pipe, there may be difficulty in swallowing food
 yadi arbud kisi badi shwaas nalee ko avaruddh kar detaa he to fefde kaa vah hissaa sikud jaataa he, usamen sankraman ho saktaa he
 Lung cancer rapidly reaches distant organs through blood vessels or lymph vessels
 asthi, edrinal granthi, mastishk or yakrut sthalaantar ke mukhya sthaan hai
 The memorial to remember it is Babul
 yadi is cancer kaa sthalaantar haddiyon main ho jaataa he to us sthaan par bahut tej dard hota he
 If the cancer reaches the brain, symptoms such as headaches, seizures, blurred vision, stroke, weakness or numbness in some parts of the body may occur
 is cancer main kai baar cancer koshikaayen hormone kii tarah kuch rasayanon kaa srav karti hai, jinke kaaran kuch vishesh lakshan hote hai
 These paraneoplastic symptoms usually occur in small cell carcinomas, but can occur in any species of cancer
 kuch small cell carcinoma adinocorticotrophic hormone kaa srav karte hai, jiske falswaroop adarinal granthiyaan adhik cortizol hormone kaa srav karti hai or rogi main kashing syndrome rog ke lakshan ho sakate hai
 Similarly, some non-small cell carcinomas make chemicals like parathyroid hormone which increases the calcium levels in the blood
 jaise kamajori, vajan kam hona, thakaavat, avsaad or manodasha vikaar ho sakate hai
 If the patient has the following symptoms, he should immediately contact the doctor
 â¢ tej khaansee aati ho yaa puraani khaansee achaanak bad jaye
 â¢ Cough bleeding
 â¢ chaati main dard
 â¢ Severe bronchitis or frequent respiratory tract infections
 â¢ achaanak vajan kam hua ho yaa thakaavat hoti ho
 â¢ wheezing or wheezing
 poochtacha or rogi ke pareekshan se chikitsak ko aksar kuch lakshan or sanket mil jate hai jo cancer kii taraf ingit karte hai
 He learns about smoking, cough, any difficulty in breathing, any obstruction in the respiratory tract, infection etc
 twachaa yaa shleshmakala kaa nila padana rakt main oxigen kii kami kaa sanket detaa he
 Swelling of the base of the nails indicates chronic lung disease
 fefde sambandhi kisi bhi naye lakshan ke liye chaati kaa eksre pehali sugam jaanch he
 Sometimes, the shadow seen in a lung x-ray creates suspicion of cancer
 lekin eksre se yah siddh nahin hota he ki yah chaaya cancer kii hi he
 Similarly, in the lungs, osteoblast or palpable tumors such as hematoma X-ray appear as cancerous
 isliye antim nidaan hetu anya pareekshan kiye jate hai

 PET SkÃ¥ne also provides information on the growth of tumors and also tells us what type of cancer cells the tumor is made of
 rogi ko kshanik adjivi radiodharmee dawa di jaati he or do chaati ke eksre jitna radiation diya jaataa he
 This drug is more collected in certain tissues than other tissues, depending on the given drug
 radiation ke prabhaav se yah dawa positron naamak kan chhodti he, jo sharir main vidyaman electrons se kriya kar gamma rez banaate hai
 The machine's scanner records these gamma rays and displays the tissues receiving the radioactive drug
 udhaaharan ke liye glucose mili radiodharmee dawa batalaayegi ki kin utakon ne glucose kaa teji se upbhog kiya jaise vikasshil or sakriy arbud

 Bone scans take pictures of bones on a computer screen or film
 chikitsak bone scan yah jaanane ke liye karavaate hai ki fefde kaa cancer haddiyon tak to nahin pahunch gaya he
 For this, a radioactive drug is left in the patient's vein
 yah dawa haddiyon main us jagah ekatrit ho jaati he jahaan sthalaantar cancer ne jagah bana lee he
 The machine's screener accepts the radioactive drug and takes a picture of the bone onto the film
 fefde ke cancer kaa antim nidaan to rogavigyaani arbud yaa cancer koshikaon kii sookshmdarshi jaanch ke baad hi karata he
 a simple method for this is to examine the mucus under microscope
 yadi arbud fefde ke madhya main sthit he or shwaasanlee tak bad chukaa he to balgam main cancer koshikaayen dikhaai pad jaati hai
 This is a cheap and riskless test
 lekin iskaa dayera simit he kyonki balgam main hameshaa cancer koshikaaye nahin dikhaai detii he
 Sometimes simple cells also look like cancer cells due to infection or trauma
 naak yaa munh dwaara shwaasanlee main prakaash strot se judi patali or kadi yaa lacheelee fibrooptic nalee daal kar shwasanpath or fefde kaa avlokan kiya jaataa he
 If the tumor is seen, then its tissue sample is taken
 bronchoscopy se praayah badi shwasanaliyon or fefde ke madhya main sthit arbud aasaani se dekhe ja sakate hai
 This investigation OPD Can be done in a chamber, surgical room or ward
 isamen rogi ko takalif or dard hota he isliye neend yaa behoshee kii sui laga di jaati he
 This test is relatively safe, yet should be done by an experienced expert
 yadi arbud dikhaai de jaye or uskaa namoona le liya jaye to cancer kaa nidaan sambhav ho jaataa he
 After this test, some patients may get dark brown blood in cough for 1 or 2 days
 isaki gambhir jatiltaaon main raktasrav hona, rakt main oxigen kam hona, heart eridamia aadi ho sakate hai
 This is the most common test in which sonography or CT
 In the direction of the scan, the needle is inserted into the lung to the cancerous knot and samples of cells are taken for microscopic examination
 yadi cancer kii gaanth fefde ke bahari hissen main sthit he or jahaan bronchoscope nahin pahunch paata he tab yah takanic bahut upyogi sabit hoti he
 For this, a numb needle is applied to the skin of the chest
 uske baad chaati main ek lambi sui cancer kii gaanth tak ghusaai jaati he
 Sonography or CT With the help of the scan, it becomes easy to insert the needle to the tumor and then the cells are pulled by applying a syringe to the needle
 lekin kabhi kabhi rogavigyaani sahi jagah se utak lene main kaamyaab nahin ho paata he
 This technique carries the risk of pneumothorax
 kabhi kabhi cancer fefde ke bahari aavaran, jise plura kehete hai, tak bhi pahunch jaataa he or is kaaran fefde or chaati ke bich ke sthaan main taral ikattha ho jaataa he
 This liquid is removed by needle and the cancer cells are examined under microscope
 is takanic main bhi newmothorex kaa thodaa jokhim rahata he
 If cancer is not diagnosed by all the above methods, then surgery is the last option
 pehla vikalp mediastinoscopy he, jisamen donon fefdon ke bich main shalya dwaara ek prob ghusaa kar arbud yaa lasicaparv se koshikaon ke namoonay le liye jate hai
 Another option is thoracotomy, in which samples of cancer cells are opened by opening the chest
 in shalya kriyaaon ke dwaara arbud ko puri tarah nikaalnaa sambhav nahin ho paata he
 For this, the patient is admitted and surgery is done in the surgical room itself
 saath hi raktasrav, sankraman, nishchetan or anya dawaaon ke kuprabhavon kaa jokhim rahata he
 Although the diagnosis of cancer is not possible by normal blood tests alone, but it gives information about the chemical or metabolic disorders caused by cancer
 jaise calcium or anzime alkaline phosphetege ke str kaa badhanaa asthi main sthalaantar cancer ke sanket detaa he
 Similarly, the increase in aspartate aminotransferase and allanine aminotransferase indicate liver morbidity, possibly due to post-partum cancer in the liver
 is cancer ke nidaan hetu rakt ke nimna pareekshan kiye jane chaiye
 CA125 and CEA in both non-small cell cancers
 Tumor markers should be examined
 cancer kii gantha ke aakaar, nearesth sanrachanaon, lasicaparvon or duurastha angon main cancer ke failaav tathaa vistaar ke aadhaar par fefde ke cancer ko vibhinn charnon main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Phase determination is also very important in terms of treatment and prognosis
 har charan ke liye alag tarah ke upachaar diye jate hai
 The doctor performs a number of tests such as blood tests, X-rays, CT scans, bone scans, MRI scans, PET skins, etc
 and determines the phase based on them
 small cell carcinoma ko do charnon main baanta gaya he
 Limited stage limited-stage SCLC - In this, the cancer remains confined within the chest
 vistrut charan extensive-stage SCLC isamen cancer chaati se baahar sharir ke kai angon tak fail chukaa hota he
 Original knot TTX The original knot has not been evaluated, or may have seen cancerous cells in samples taken from the mucus or respiratory tract but was not detected in bronchoscopy or shading tests

 upachaar sambandhi nirnay cancer ke amaap, sthiti, sanvruddhi, vistaar, sthalaantar or rogi kii umr tathaa uske swasthya par nirbhar karata he
 Like other cancers, the treatment of lung cancer can also be curative or palliative
 praayah ek se adhik tarah ke upachaar diye jate hai
 When a treatment is given to increase the effectiveness of the main treatment, it is called adjuvant therapy
 jaise shalya-kriya ke baad bache hui cancer koshikaon ko maarane ke liye chemotherapy yaa radiotherapy sahaayak upachaar ke rup main di jaati he
 If the treatment is given to shrink the tumor before surgery, it is called a new supportive treatment
 cancer kaa uchhedan sabase upyukt upachaar he yadi cancer fefde ke baahar nahin fail sakaa he
 Cancer is performed at certain stages of non-small cell cancer
 amuman is cancer ke 10%-35% rogiyon main shalya kriya kii jaati he, lekin rogi ko puri raahat nahin mil paati he kyonki cancer nidaan ke samay hi cancer bahut fail chukaa hota he or shalya-kriya ke baad cancer kabhi bhi dobaaraa utpann ho jaataa he
 Among patients in whom slow-growing lonely cancer is performed, 25% -40% of patients only live for five years
 kai baar rogi kaa cancer sanrachanaatmak drushti se to shalya yogya hota he lekin rogi kii gambhir haalat ke kaaran shalya karnaa jokhim bharaa kaam ho saktaa he
 In small cell cancer, the probability of surgery is relatively low
 kyonki yah teji se failata he or fefde ke ek hisse main simit ho kar nahin rah paata he
 The operation depends on the size and position of the tumor
 yah badi shalya kriya he, rogi ko bhartee karnaa padataa he or shalya ke baad bhi lambe samay tak dekhbhaal hetu aspataal main hi rakhana padataa he
 In this, the patient is unconscious and the chest has to be opened
 iske baad shalya-karmi fefde kaa ek hissaa, fefde kaa ek khand yaa puraa fefda nikaal letaa he
 Sometimes LASIKAPARV is located in the lungs
 shalya ke baad rogi ko shwaas ksht, saans ukhdana, dard or kamajori rahati he
 Bleeding, infection and anesthesia are the main surgical hazards
 radiotherapy small cell or non small cell donon prajati ke cancer main di jaati he
 In radiation treatment, developing cancer cells are killed by powerful X-rays or other types of radiation
 radiotherapy upachaaratmak, prashamak yaa anya upachaar ke saath sahaayak upachaar ke rup diya jaataa he
 Radiation is given either by focusing the machine on the outside from the cancer or by placing small capsules filled with radioactive material near the cancerous lump in the body
 brekitherapy main bronchoscope dwaara radiodharmee padaarth se bhare chote se pellette ko cancer kii ganth main yaa paas kii kisi shwaasanlee main avasthit kar diya jaataa he
 Radiation from this pellet covers a short distance so it greatly reduces the damage to the surrounding healthy tissue
 brekitherapy cancer kaa gaanth ko chota karne or shwaasanlee main sthit cancer ke kaaran utpann lakshan ke upachaar ke liye prachlit he
 If the patient refuses for surgery, his cancer has spread to the lymphatic or trachea so that it is not possible to perform surgery or due to any other serious disease, then he is given radiotherapy
 is
 radiation jab mukhya upachaar ke rup main diya jaataa he to yah sirf ganth ko choti karata he yaa uske vikaas ko simit rakhata he, jisase rogi kuch samay tak swasth bana rahata he
 10% -15% of patients lead healthy lives for a long time
 radiotherapy ke saath chemotherapy bhi di jaati he to jeene kii aas thodi or bad jaati he
 External radiotherapy is given in the OPD department, but the patient has to be admitted for a day or two to deliver internal radiotherapy
 yadi rogi ko cancer ke alaava koi anya gambhir fefde kaa rog he to radiotherapy nahin di ja sakati he kyonki fefde kii haalat or adhik kharaab hone kaa khatra rahata he
 a special type of external radiotherapy called gamma knife is given in the brain for isolated locomotor cancer
 isamen sir ko sthir karke radiation ke kai punjon ko cancer par kendrit karke kuch minute yaa ghanton ke liye radiation diya jaataa he
 In this healthy tissues get relatively small amount of radiation
 bahya radiation therapy main upachaar se pehle si
tii
scan, computer or sahi naap ke madad se simulation dwaara yah pataa kar liya jaataa he ki radiation kis jagah kendrit ho rahaa he
 It takes 30 minutes to two hours
 bahari radiation saptaah main 4 yaa 5 din kai saptaah kii avadhi tak diya jaataa he
 Radiation therapy does not have major risks like surgery, but there are some unpleasant side effects such as tiredness and weakness
 shwet rakt kan kam hona yaa bimbaanu kam hona bhi radiation ke kuprabhav hai
 If radiation also falls on the digestive organs, nausea, nausea or diarrhea may occur
 twachaa main khujali or jalan ho sakati he
 Chemotherapy is given in both small cell and non small cell cancers
 chemotherapy main dawaaen cancer koshikaon ko maarane yaa unke teji hone vaale vibhaajan ko rokane ke liye di jaati hai
 Chemotherapy is given as curative, surgical or radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy
 vaise to aajkal bahut sari chimo davaayen prachlit hai lekin fefde ke cancer main platinmayukt dawaaen jaise sisplatin yaa carboplatin sabase prabhaavshaalee sabit hui hai
 Chemotherapy is the most effective treatment in almost all small cell cancers, as it has often spread throughout the body at the time of diagnosis
 small cell cancer ke sirf aadhe rogi hi chemotherapy ke bina chaar maheene ji pate hai
 But after chemo, their life is long
 non small cell cancer main akeli chimo itani asardaar sabit nahin hui he, lekin yadi cancer kaa sthalaantar ho chukaa he to kai rogiyon kaa jivan kaal to badhata hi he
 Chemotherapy is given in tablets, venous passages or both ways
 chimo praayah o
pi
di
 vibhaag main di jaati he
 In a cycle, some medicines are given according to predetermined rules, after which the patient is given a short break
 is dauraan vah chimo ke kuprabhavon ke ksht paata he or phir dhire-dhire unase mukt ho jaataa he to aglaa chakra diya jaataa he
 In this way several cycles of chemo are given
 durbhagyavash chimo main di jane vaali davaayen swasth koshikaon ko bhi kshatigrast karata he jisase kai apriy or kshtdaayak kuprabhav hote hai
 Reduction of white blood cells or reduced spore are the major side effects of chemo
 thakaavat, bal jhadanaa, michali, ubakaai, dast, munh main chhaale pad janaa aadi anya kuprabhav hai
 The side effects of chemo depends on the amount of the medicine, other drugs given in the mixture, and the patient's health
 dawa ke kuprabhav ke liye bhi kuch vishesh dawaaen di jaati hai
 Following are the prevalent regimen of chemotherapy in small cell lung cancer
 PE rigim PEC Regime CAV rigim CAVE ek dawa vaali rigim The following chemotherapy is given in recurrence cancer
 topotecon yadi rogi ko hridayrog ho or doxorubisin dena sambhav nahin ho kyonki hriday ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 AUC = area under the concentration curve; bid = twice daily; IV = administered intravenously; PO = administered orally
 non small cell fefde ke cancer main chemotherapy bahut zyada prabhaavshaalee sabit nahin hui he
