 kataki mela, uttar pradesh ke bundelkhand kshetra main banda jile main sthit ek kasbe kalinger ke kalinger durg main prativarsh karthik poornima ke avasar par paanch diwas ke liye lagata he
 Thousands of devotees throng to it
 saakshyon ke anusaar yah mela chandel shaasha parimardidev ke samay armbh hua tha, jo aaj tak lagata aa rahaa he
 The first mention of this Kalinjar festival is found in the drama metaphor Shatakam composed by Parimardev's minister and playwright Vatsaraj
 unke shasankaal main har varsh mantri vatsaraj ke do naatakon kaa manchan isi mahotsav ke avasar par kiya jaataa tha
 Later, during the time of Madanavarman, the dance programs of a dancer named Padmavati are also mentioned in the history of Kalinjar
 uskaa nrity us samay mahotsav kaa mukhya aakarshan hua karata tha
 This tradition has been going on for a thousand years even today as a Katki fair, in which millions of people from different regions come here and bathe in various ponds and get a reward by seeing Neelkantheshwar Mahadev

 The Kartik, or Katki Mela, on the banks of the Ganges River in Bithoor on the day of Kartik Purnima, is famous all over North India since ancient times
 kanpur shahar se 15 kilometre dur ganga tat par sthit bithur vaise to har saal dharmik lihaaj se shraddhaluon ke aakarshan kaa centre rahata he, lekin karthik poornima ke din yahaan bada mela lagata he
 The battle of Naulakha defeat started in the fair lasting three days here, which later became a silent witness to the historical battle between the Chandela dynasty of Mahoba
 jambudweep ke arntagat bharatkhand ke aryaavart pradesh main maa ganga or yamuna jaisi paavan nadiyon ke doaab main sthit bithur kaa karthik mela ek aitihaasik yuddh kaa bhi gavaah he
 It is said that in the second half of the 12th century, during the Kartik Purnima, the Maharaja of all fours started preparing for the Bithur Fair, then Karinga, the son of Raja Jambhi of Mandavgarh, also went to the fair of Bithoor
 tab uski bahan ne manuhaarpurn vaani main usase kaha ki bhai hamaare liye meley se koi anmol vastu jarur le aana
 Karinga, with a promise to his sister, traveled with his small army to the Bithoor fair
 bithur ke kataki meley main mahoba ke chandel raja parmardi dev kii rani malana devi bhi apni bahan ke saath ai thi
 The boundary of Bithoor was then five kos
 raja parmaal ke anya do putr dakshraj va vrutsaraj mahoba se teen kilometre dur dasharapur main mahal banaakar rahete the
 The sons of these Daksharaj were Alha and Udal
 dakshraj kii patni devladevi ko uski choti bahan malanadevi ne naulakha haar uphaar main diya tha
 Wearing the same necklace, Devla Devi came to the fair on Kartik Purnima of Bithoor
 malanadevi ke gale main haar dekhakar karinga kaa man dol gaya usne rani kii sena par hamalaa bol diya
 When he snatches the queen's necklace, then Talan Syed of Banarasgaon, Gorakhpur, hearing the noise, challenged his soldiers, the soldiers drove Karinga
 rani ne syed ko apana dharm bhai bana liya
 Humiliated Karinga again stormed into Daspur at night and snatched the queen's necklace

 Karinga was killed in the famous battle of Mandavgarh
 devla devi kaa naulakha haar mil waapas mil gaya
 In this way the fair of Karthik Purnima of Bithoor became the father of the famous battle of Mandwa

 Osteoporosis or osteoporosis is a bone disease that increases the risk of fractures
 osteoporosis main asthi khanij ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, asthi sookshm-sanrachana vighatit hoti he or asthi main asangrahit protein kii raashi or vividhta parivartit hoti he
 The World Health Organization has defined osteoporosis in women as the bone mineral density 2
5 standard deviations below the maximum bone mass as measured by DXA; The term "establishment of osteoporosis" also includes the presence of delicate fractures
 osteoporosis, mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad sarvaadhik saamaanya he, jab use rajonivrittottar osteoporosis kehete hai, par yah purushon main bhi viksit ho saktaa he or yah kisi main bhi vishisht hormone sambandhi vikaar tathaa anya dirghakaalik bimariyon ke kaaran yaa aushadhiyon, vishesh rup se glucocorticoid ke parinamswaroop ho saktaa he, jab is beemaari ko steroid yaa glucocorticoid-prerit osteoporosis kaha jaataa he
 Given its effect, the risk of fragile fracture remains, bone weakness can significantly affect life expectancy and quality of life
 osteoporosis ko jivan-style main parivartan or kabhi-kabhi dawaaiyon se roka ja saktaa he; haddiyon kii kamazori vaale logon ke upachaar main donon shaamil ho sakati hai
 Changing lifestyles include exercising and preventing falls; Medicines include calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, and many others

 Exercise, with its anabolic effect, can at the same time stop or reverse osteoporosis
 osteoporosis ke sabhi maamalon main antarnihit pranali asthi avasorana or asthi-nirmaan ke bich asantulan he
 The normal bone contains a constant bone reproducibility matrix; At any given point of time, 10% of all bone mass undergoes reproduction
 jaisaa ki 1963 main frost ne pehali baar bataaya, yah prakriya asthi bahukoshikeey ikaayiyon main ghatit hoti he
 Bone is absorbed by osteoblast cells, after which new bone is deposited by osteoblast cells

 The amount of estrogen required to suppress this process is generally lower than the amount expected to stimulate the uterus and mammary gland
 asthi her-pher ke viniman main α-rup kaa estrogen receptor bahut mahatvapurn lagata he
 In bone manipulation, calcium metabolism plays an important role in addition to estrogen, and calcium and vitamin d deficiency leads to bone deposition atrophy; Additionally, the parathyroid glands respond to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone, which increases bone absorption to ensure adequate amounts of calcium in the blood
 asthi nickshepan ko badhaane vaali, thyroid dwaara utpaadit hormone calsitonin kii bhoomika kam spasht he or sambhawatah PTH kii tarah utani mahatvapurn nahin
 Activation of osteoblasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL has been the most studied
 yah anu, asthikorak or anya koshikaon dwaara nirmit hota he or RANK ko uttejit karata he
 Osteoprotigerin combines RANKL before it has a chance to bind RANK and therefore suppresses its ability to increase bone absorption
 RANKL, RANK or OPG, tumor parigalan kaarak or uske grahiyon se nikat se jude hue hai
 The role of the Wnt signaling pathway has been accepted, but is poorly understood
 eicosnoid or interlukin ke sthaneey utpaadan ko, asthi her-pher ko niyantrit karne main bhaag lene vaala mana jaataa he or osteoporosis ke vikaas ke mul main in madhyasthon kaa adhik yaa kam utpaadan kaarak ho saktaa he
 The bony bone is the spongy bone located at the end of the long bones and vertebrae
 valkuteey asthi, haddiyon kaa kathor bahari kavach or lambii haddiyon kaa madhya he
 Because osteoblasts and osteoblasts reside on the surface of bones, the ligamentous bone is more active and subject to bone manipulation and regeneration
 na keval asthi ghanatv kam hota he, balki asthi kii sookshm-sanrachana baadhit hoti he
 The ligamentous bone weak bones are dislocated and replaced by weak bones
 aam osteoporotic asthi-bhang jagahen, yatha kalai, kuulhe or ridh kii haddi main valkuteey asthi se bandhakmay asthi kaa anupaat apekshaakrit ucch hota he
 These sites are dependent on the asymptomatic bone for strength, and therefore when the reproduction is unbalanced, rapid regeneration leads to weathering of these sites
 osteoporosis kaa apana koi vishesh lakshan nahin he; iskaa mukhya parinaam, asthi bhang kaa vardhit jokhim he
 Osteoporotic fractures occur in conditions where bone is not broken in healthy people in general; Hence they are considered to be fragile fractures
 vishisht najuk asthi-bhang kasheruki stambh, pasli, kuulhe or kalai main hote hai
 Symptoms of spinal cord depression are sudden back pain, often accompanied by nerve root pain and rarely with spinal compression or caudal cavity syndrome
 Multiple vertebral fractures cause long-term pain due to tingling, loss of height, consequent decrease in mobility
 lambii haddiyon ke asthi-bhang gatishiltaa par teevr kshati pahunchaate hai or shalya-chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Hip fractures in particular typically require immediate surgery, as hip fractures are associated with several serious risks such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary angiography and increased death

 Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures can be divided between non-variable and variable
 iske atirikt, aise vishisht rog tathaa vikaar maujuud hai, jinamein osteoporosis ek sweekrut samasya he
 Medication use is theoretically variable, although in many cases the use of drugs that increase the risk of osteoporosis is unavoidable
 osteoporosis ke liye sabase mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak he unnat umr or mahila ling; rajonivritti ke baad estrogen kii kami asthi khanij ghanatv kii teji se kami ke saath sah-sambhddha he, jabaki purushon main testosterone ke str main kami kaa tulanaatmak prabhaav padataa he

 Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki haddi upaapachay ko prabhavit karne vaali antarnihit vyavastha sidhi he, jabaki dusron ke liye, kaaran kai or agyaat hai
 Some drugs have been linked to increased osteoporosis risk; Classically, only steroids and anticonvulsants are associated, but evidence is emerging regarding other drugs as well
 osteoporosis kaa nidaan asthi khanij ghanatv ko maapne par kiya jaataa he
 Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most popular method

 Depending on the likelihood of the original problem, cancer can be investigated with bone deflections including multi-marrow, Cushing's disease and other factors mentioned above
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi ko osteoporosis ke nidaan ke liye swarna maanak mana jaataa he
 Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2
5 standard deviations of the young adult reference population
 ise T-score kaha jaataa he
 The World Health Organization has established the following guidelines: jab osteoporotic fracture bhi ho, jise ek khadi oonchai se girane kii vajah se ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, tab shabd "gambhir yaa sthapit" osteoporosis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The International Committee on Diagnostic Densitometry recognizes that osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be diagnosed on the basis of density measurement criteria alone
 They also state that for pre-menopausal women, a Z-score should be used instead of a T-score, and that osteoporosis should not be diagnosed in such women as well, based on densification criteria alone

 Clinical prediction rules are available to conduct the selection of women aged 60–64 for screening
 sarvaadhik samvedansheel ranneeti osteoporosis jokhim moolyankan saadhan ho saktaa he
 In relation to the screening of men, a cost-analysis study suggests that the investigation "costs in cases of auto-reported pre-fractures in men 65 years of age and without pre-fractures in men 80 years and older" May be less "
 In addition, in middle-to-adult men, a significant reduction in testosterone levels, say less than 300, may be less expensive to detect
 ling ke aadhaar par osteoporosis kaa ilaaj karne ke liye kai dawaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Changes in lifestyle are also an aspect of treatment
 upachaar ke liye bisphosphonet mukhya aushadhiy upaay he
 However, in the 1990s, new drugs such as teriparatide and strontium renalate appeared
 pusht osteoporosis maamle main bisphosphonet dawaaen mahilaon ke upachaar-variyata kram main pratham rahi hai
 Commonly included in the prescription are bisphosphonate according to presently sodium alendronate 10 mg per day or 70 mg once a week, risadronate 5 mg per day or 35 mg once a week and or ibandronate once a month
 2007 nirmaataa-samarthit ek adhyayan kaa bataaya ki kam-prabhaav kulha asthi-bhang se peedit rogiyon main, 5 mg zoladronic amla ke vaarshik aadhaan ne kisi bhi fracture ke khatre ko 35% tak, kasheruki fracture ke khatre ko 3
8% se 1
7% tak or gaiyr-kasheruki fracture ke jokhim ko 10
7% se 7
6% tak kam kiya he
 The study also found mortality benefit after 1
9 years: 9
6% of the study group died due to any cause, indicating 28% mortality benefit
 maukhik bisphosphonet apekshaakrit kam avashoshit hote hai or isliye inhen khaali pet lenaa chahie, jahaan agle 30 minute tak koi bhojan yaa peya naa liya jaae

 Although intermittent doses with intravenous prescriptions such as zolendronate prevent oral tolerance problems, these factors are predominantly involved in a rare but unpleasant oral disease called mandibular osteonecrosis
 is kaaran se, maukhik bisphosphonet chikitsa ko sambhawatah tarjeeh di jaani chahie or ab doctor yah anushansa karte hai ki upachaar se purv hi koi bhi upachaaratmak danta kaary kar lenaa chahie
 Recently, teriparatide has been found to be effective against osteoporosis
 yah paratharid hormone kii tarah kaam karata he or asthikorak uttejit karata he or is prakaar unki gatividhi badhati he
 It is used mostly for patients with osteoporosis, especially those with low BMD or multiple fracture risk factors, or who cannot tolerate oral biophosphonates
 yah kalam jaise ek injection upkaran ke istemaal ke saath dainik injection ke rup main diya jaataa he
 In some countries, teriparatide can be used for treatment only if biophosphonates fail or are prohibited
 purv vikiran chikitsa yaa paget rog vaale mariz yaa yuva marijon ko is dawa se bachanaa chahie
 Oral strontium renalate is an alternative oral treatment, which belongs to a class of drugs that its manufacturer has named "dual action bone agents"
 isane vishesh rup se kasheruki fracture ke nivaaran main apni kshamta sabit kar di he
 Laboratory experiments noted that strontium renalate promotes the proliferation of osteoblasts, as well as restricts the proliferation of osteoblasts
 stronsium rinlate ko har rose 2g maukhik nilamban ke rup main liya jaataa he or kasheruki or hip fracture ko rokane ke liye haddiyon kii kamajori ke upachaar hetu ise license di gai he
 Strongium renlate has a side effect effect compared to bisphosphonate, as it does not produce any type of upper GI adjunctive effect, which is the most common reason for drug withdrawal in osteoporosis
 adhyayanon main shiraparak ghanasrashalyata ke jokhim main thodi-si vruddhi note kii gai, jiske kaaran kaa nirdhaaran nahin kiya gaya he
 This suggests that it may be less appropriate in patients with thrombosis risk for different reasons

 a correction algorithm is designed
 haalanki stronsium rinlate prabhavi he, par sanyukt rajya america main abhi tak iskaa upyog sweekrut nahin hua he
 However, strontium citrate is available from many well-known vitamin manufacturers in the US
 adhikansh shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki stronsium bhale hi kisi rup main prayukt ho, vah surakshit or prabhavi he
 The Rheinlet type is only a tool invented by the French Servier Company to patent its version of strontium
 strontium, chaahe uskaa koi bhi rup ho, pani main ghulne yogya or udar amla main ynit hona chahie
 stronsium ko tab antra nalee se rakt pravaah main vahan ke liye protein-baddh kiya jaataa he
 Unlike drugs such as sodium alendronate, strontium does not inhibit bone reorientation and, in fact, can produce stronger bones
 adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki paanch saal ke baad alendronet asthi kshay kaa kaarak bhi ho saktaa he, jabaki stronsium jivan-kaal ke dauraan prayukti se haddi kaa nirmaan jari rakhata he
 Strontium should not be taken with diet or calcium-rich dishes, as calcium competes with strontium during levitation
 phir bhi, yah zaruri he ki har rose calcium, magnesium or chikitsiya maatra main vitamin di lenaa chahie, lekin stronsium lete samay main nahin
 stronsium ko raat main khaali pet lenaa chahie
 Estrogen replacement treatment is a good treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis, but at this time, unless other indications for its use are available, it is not recommended
 mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad pehle dashak main estrogen kii sifaarish ke bare main anischitata or vivaad maujuud hai
 Bone quantity and quality have been shown to improve with testosterone in men with hypogonadism, but, as of 2008, there have been no studies of the effect with fracture or a normal level on testosterone in men
 SERM dawaaon kaa ek varg he, jo puure sharir main estrogen grahiyon par ek chaynaatmak tareeke se kaam karte hai
 Generally, bone mineral density is controlled by an equilibrium between osteoblasts and osteoclast activity in the trabecular bone
 estrogen kii asthi gathan-avasorana santulan ke niyaman main pramukh bhoomika he, kyonki yah asthikorak gatividhiyon ko badhaava detaa he
 Some serms, such as raloxifene, have effects on the bones, slowing bone absorption by osteoclasts
 naidanik pareekshanon main SERM ko prabhavi sabit kiya gaya he
 Calcium is needed for bone growth, bone healing and bone strength and is an aspect of bone weakness treatment
 desh or umr ke aadhaar par khaane main calcium kii siforeeshon main bhinnata he; jin logon ko osteoporosis kaa adhik khatara he unke liye america swasthya agenciyon dwaara sujhai gai maatra 1200 mg prati din he
 Calcium supplements can be used to increase dietary intake and absorption can be optimized through taking several small doses throughout the day
 osteoporosis ko rokane or iske ilaaj main calcium kii bhoomika aspasht he - bahut kam calcium kii maatra vaali kuch aabaadiyon main bhi haddiyon ke fracture kii dar atyant kam hai or doodh or dugdh utpaadon ke madhyam se khaane main calcium ke ucch dar vaale anya logon main asthi-bhang kii dar ucch hai
 All other factors, such as protein, salt and vitamin d intake, exercise and exposure to sunlight, can affect bone mineral, making calcium a factor in eating, among many other factors in the development of osteoporosis
 2007 main, WHO ke ek report main kaha gaya he ki aahaar ke saath amleey milawat ke saath calcium khaane kii vajah se vah haddiyon kii kamazori ko prabhavit karata he
 
 calcium or calcium va vitamin d shaamil yadrichhik niyantrit pareekshanon ke ek madhya-vishleshan ne calcium ke ucch staron ke upyog or vitamin di kaa samarthan kiya, haalanki asthi swasthya ke akalan ke liye prayukt maapdand ke aadhaar par parinaamon main vibhinnata rahi
 ek anya adhyayan ke saath madhya-vishleshan ne ilaaj ke protocol kaa shreshth anupaalan karne vaale rogiyon ke liye kaaphi behatar parinaamon kaa samarthan kiya
 In contrast, despite previous reports of elevated high lipoprotein density in calcium supplements, a possible increase in the rate was found
 yadi pushti ho, yah sanket detaa he ki fracture ke kam jokhim vaali mahilaon main calcium kii poorakta se achche se zyada nuksaan hi ho saktaa he
 Some studies have shown that an overdose of vitamin d reduces bone fractures in the elderly, although the Women's Health Initiative found that although calcium and vitamin d increased bone density by 1%, it increased hip bone -did not affect the atrophy, but increased the formation of kidney stones by 17%
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki airobics, bhaar sahan or pratirodh abhyaas sabhi rajonivrutottar mahilaon main BMD ko banaae rakh sakate hai yaa badha sakate hai
 Many researchers have tried to indicate which exercises are most effective in improving BMD and other metrics of bone quality, but results have varied
 rajonivrutottar mahilaon main niyamit rup se ek saal ke liye kud abhyaas se BMD or sannikat tibia kii niskriyata ke kshan kii vruddhi prathit hoti he
 Treadmill walking, exercise training, walking, jumping, endurance and strength exercises all resulted in significant increases of L2-L4 BMD in post-menopausal women
 Strength training led to an improvement in BMD of the distal radius and hip, in particular

 Black tie is a dress code for evening formal events and is worn in a variety of social ceremonies
 kisi vyakti ke liye mukhya ghatak ek jacket hota he jise dinar jacket yaa taxido ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo aam taur par kaale rang kii hoti he lekin kabhi-kabhi ise anya rangon main bhi dekha gaya he
 In the same way, women's evening dresses range from a cocktail dress to long gowns worn in the evening, depending on current fashion, local customs, and time of occasion
 taxido shabd kaa prayog bhi duniya ke alag-alag hisson main vividh prakaar se hota he
 It always refers to some form of dinner jacket and is mostly used in North America, where the term originated
 vahaan aam taur par iskaa matlab paramparaagat kaali taai par koi aadhunik vividhta se he, jabaki britain main, kabhi-kabhi safed jacket ke vikalp kaa ullekh karne ke liye iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The black tie dates back to 1860 when Henry Pool & Co
 of Seville Row created a small smoking jacket for the Prince of Wales to wear as a white tie dress — an alternative to the standard formal dress — at informal dinner parties
 us samay desh main lounj suut pahanane kaa chalan shuru ho gaya tha or nayaa dress code shaam ko pahana jane vaala ek lounj suut tha, jise shahar ke baahar ek aaraam ke maahaul main pahanane ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 In the spring of 1886, Prince invited a rich New York man, James Potter and his wife, Cora Potter, to his Norfolk hunting ground estate, Sandringham House
 jab potter ne prince se ratribhoj kii poshaak ke bare main suzav maanga to unhone potter ko landan sthit henry pool and company ke paas bhej diya
 Returning to New York in 1886, Potter's dinner suite proved popular at the Tuxedo Park Club; The club people mimicked him and soon it became his informal dining uniform
 purushon kii shaam kii poshaak ab taxido ke naam se lokapriy ho gayi he, jiskaa naam taxido park se liya gaya he, jahaan iske bare main kaha jaataa he ki ise sanyukt rajya america main sabase pehali baar griswald lorillard dwaara taxido club ke vaarshik autom ball main pahana gaya tha, jisaki sthapana piyare lorillard IV dwaara kii gayi thi or tab se yah america main aupchaarik dress ke liye lokapriy ho gaya
 Fables reveal that it became known as a tuxedo when a fellow at the Autumn Ball asked the other partner "why the man's jacket does not have coattails
" ?" duusare ne jawaab diya, "vah taxido park se aayaa he
 "the first gentleman misinterpreted it and told all his friends that he saw a man wearing a jacket without a coattail called a tuxedo, but it was not a tuxedo
 do saal baad, britain main iskaa naam dinar jacket diya gaya, iskaa yahi naam purvottar america main bhi rakhaa gaya tha
 While the new dress was initially called a tuxedo in the US, the term has since been misused, especially in the US, in any form of formal or white tie, including a morning dress and a walking dress
 It is used to describe semi-formal dress
 white taai, jise bahut sakhti se viniyamit kiya jaataa he, iske vipareet blike taai ke samparidhaan main kahin adhik vividhta dekhi jaati he
 In short, its traditional components are: vishesh blike-taai jacket single-brested, ventles or kaali yaa midnite blue rang kii hoti he; yah aam taur par poliester, oon yaa ek mohair bland--oon kii hoti he
 Double breasted models are less common, but equally acceptable
 lapal yaa to ek grosgraine yaa phir kam paaramparik satin bunai main resham ke saath saamne kiye ja sakate hai
 Traditionally there are two choices of lapel, the shawl collar taken from a smoking jacket and the peak lapel, which is taken from the tailcoat
 pehla vikalp purana he jabaki doosraa kahin adhik aupchaarik mana jaataa he
 Jagged lapel, a third style of lapel, has recently gained popularity, and some accept it as "a reasonable 


 less formal option", though purists for its lounge suit-like derivation, unlike some predecessors
 It is ignored by france, italy, brazil, germany, spain, purv soviet sangh or purv yugoslavia main jacket ko smoking kaha jaataa he
 In France, the shawl-collared version is Le Smoking Duville while the pointed-eyed version is Le Smoking Capri
 dabl-brested jacket single-brested jacket kii tulana main kuch had tak adhik aadhunik or kam aupchaarik he; jabaki ise multah keval ghar main pahani jane vaali poshaak ke rup main sweekaarya mana jaataa tha, lekin yah ab sabhi avasaron ke liye samaan rup se uchit he, haalanki kuch alag tarah kii pasand kii samagriyon ke sambandh main paramparaagat niyamon kaa paalan kiya ja saktaa he
 Although this is more common with a pointed lapel, a shawl lapel is appropriate
 kisi bhi andruni batan sahit taanke jane vaale sabhi batano ko aam taur par dohari-chaati vaale lounj suut par taanke bagaiyr chhod diya ja saktaa he
 While two-buttoned types are sometimes seen, traditional single-breasted jackets have a buttoned up
 shuruaati kritrim roshni main kaale rang ko hare rang vividhta dene ke liya janaa jaataa tha, isliye prince of wales ne midnite blue rang ko shaamil kiya or yah standard dinar jacket ke liye ekmaatr sweekaarya vaikalpik rang rahaa he
 White dinner jacket is often worn in hot weather
 yah shuddh safed kii bajaay aam taur par hathidanth ke rang kaa hota he or isamen silk-fesed lapal kii bajaay self-fesed lapal hota he
 It is worn like a black dinner jacket with a similar shirt and accessories, although turndown collars and waistbands are seen far more commonly than petal collars or waistcoats
 isi tarah kahin adhik aupchaarik peak lapal ke mukaable safed dinar jacketon main shawl lapal kahin adhik aam hai, haalanki donon hi sahi hai
 White dinner jackets are traditionally worn only in the US and Canada from Memorial Day to Labor Day in the spring
 
 The customary rule in the UK is that white dinner jackets are never worn, even on the hottest summer day, but they are reserved for wearing abroad
 in niyamon ke kuch apwaad hai, america main hai-skool ke aayojanon main or britain main last nite ke udaahranon main mashhoor, kuch sangeet kaaryakramon main iskaa upyog
 anya ushnkaribandheey jalwaayu main, jaise ki imperial burma main aitihaasik drushti se kam aupchaarik rang ke rup main desert phon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha

 ausat rup main dekha jaae to prithvi se bahut kam ghanaa he - kyonki prithvi par pathar or anya baari padaarth adhik pratishat main hai jabaki arun par gas adhik he
 That is why it is only four and a half to fourteen times heavier than the earth, despite having a size of three to three times larger than the earth

 On 13 March 1781, William Herschel announced its discovery
 arun doorabeen dwaara paae jane vaala pehla grah tha
 The four planets in our solar system are called gas demons, because they contain mostly gas instead of clay and stone and they are very large in size
 arun iname se ek he - baaki teen brihaspati, shani or varun hai
 Of these, Arun's texture is very similar to Varun
 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"

 Its orbital elements were first calculated by pierre-cimon Laplace in 1783
 Over time, discrepancies between predicted and observed orbits began to appear, and in 1841 John Couch Adams first proposed that this difference could be due to the gravitational pull of an invisible planet

 Its pole uses a definition supported by the recent International Astronomical Union for identification as "south", despite the planet's direction of rotation
 arthath ki grah yaa upgrah kaa uttari dhruv vah dhruv hoga jo soramandal ke avikari tal ke upar kii ore hoga
 Sometimes a different convention is used, in which the north and south poles of a body are defined according to the south-hand rule with respect to the direction of rotation

 This value indicates that it is mainly composed of different types of ice, such as water, ammonia, and methane
 The overall amount of ice in the interior of Uranus is not known properly, different figures emerge according to the choice of the model, it should be between 9
3 and 13
5 of the Earth's mass
 Hydrogen and helium make up only a small part of the composite
 The remaining non-ice content is composed of rocky material

 For example, if sufficient amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, then the total amount of ice in the inner part will be reduced and similarly the amount of rocks and hydrogen will increase
 Currently available data does not allow science to determine which model is correct

 One hypothesis for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a giant impact body, most of Uranus' proto heat was ejected, releasing that heat with an expired core temperature
 Another hypothesis is that some kind of barrier exists in the upper layers of Uranus which prevents the heat of the core from reaching the surface

 Physical fitness is usually achieved through exercise, proper diet and adequate rest

 haalanki, swachaalan ke kaaran aaraam kaa samay badha, audyogic kranti ke baad jivan style main parivartan se yah paribhaasha aparyaapt ho gai
 These days, physical fitness is considered to be a criterion for physical and effective activities of work and rest, fitness, immunity to low kinetic diseases, and physical ability to cope with emergent situations

 Many sources also mention mental and emotional health as an important part of overall fitness
