 HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard that is currently under development
 apane tatkaal purvavartiyon achtmal 4
01, tathaa exchatimal 1
1 kii hi tarah, achtmal5 bhi world wide web par saamagree kii sanrachana tathaa usko prastut karne vaala ek maanak he
 The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group began work on the new standard in 2004; At that time the World Wide Web Consortium was focusing on the futuristic development of XHTML 2
0 and HTML 4
01 had not been updated since 2004
 2009 main, W3C ne exchatimal 2
0 kaary samooh ke charter ko samaapt ho jane diya or use navinikrut nahin karne kaa nirnay liya
 W3C and WHATWG are currently working together on the development of HTML5
 achtmal5 ko nimna baton ke pratikriyaswaroop viksit kiya ja rahaa he - world wide web par saamaanya upyog main aane vaale achtmal tathaa exchatimal, kai vinirdeshon, web broujar jaise software utpaadon, saamaanya abhyaas dwaara sthapit tathaa maujuuda web dastavejon main kai vaakyavinyas trutiyon dwaara pesh kii gayi suvidhaon kaa mishran he
 It is also an attempt to define a markup language that can be written in HTML or XHTML syntax
 isamen aapasi rup se adhik jude hue kriyaanwanon ko protsaahit karne vaale vistrut prasanskaran model shaamil hai; yah dastavejon ke uplabdh markup ko vistrut, behatar tathaa tarksangat banaata he; or jatil web aplications ke liye markup tathaa epiai ko pesh karata he
 In particular, HTML5 adds several new syntax features
 iname shaamil he,, or tatwon ke saath-saath SVG saamagree kaa ekikaran, jinhen swaamitv vaali plugains tathaa unki epiai kaa upyog kiye bina hi web par multimedia or graphic saamagree ko shaamil tathaa istemaal kiye jane kii prakriya ko behatar banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 New elements such as,, and have been designed to improve the cementic richness of documents
 anya tatwon ke hataa diya gaya he
 New features have also been introduced and others have been removed to improve and simplify the lexical expression
 , or jaise kuch tatwon ko parivartit, punauparibhaashit tathaa manakikrut kiya gaya he
 apis and doms have now become a basic part of the HTML5 specification
 yah amaanya dastavejon ke liye aavashyak prasanskaran ko bhi kuch vistaar se paribhaashit karata he taaki vaakyavinyas trutiyon ke liye sabhi broujaron tathaa anya upyogkarta agenton dwaara samaan mandandon kaa upyog kiya jaye
 a common misconception is that HTML5 can provide animation within web pages, which is incorrect
 achtmal tatwon ko anemet karne ke liye javascript aavashyak he
 Animation can also be done using javascript and HTML4
 appal jaise kuch sanghathan, puraani praudyogikiyon yaa vastav main siesas ke bhavishya ke sanskarnon par nirbhar karne vaali praudyogikiyon ke vishay main yah daawa karke ki ve "achtmal 5" hai, in galat dharanaon ko badhaava de rahe hai
 For example, there are many demos of technologies on Apple's Web site that Apple claims are examples of HTML5
 haalanki, vahaan maujuud chah demo main se keval do, achtmal 5 maanak kii anany praudyogikiyon par nirbhar hai
 Web Applications 1

 As of March 2010, work started under the name; This specification exists in the draft standard state with WHATWG and in the working draft state near W3C

 k Ian Hickson is the editor of HTML5
 achtmal5 vinirdesh ko 2007 main world wide web concortium ke nae achtmal kaarydal ke kaary ke prarambh bindu ke rup main apanaaya gaya tha
 The working group published the first public working draft of the specification on 22 January 2008
 vinirdesh kaa kaam ek jari kaary he or kai varshon tak iske aisa hi rahane kii ummid he, haalanki puure vinirdesh ke antim anushansi str tak pahunchne se pehle hi achtmal5 ke kuch hisson ke samaapt hone kii ummid he tathaa brouzaron main unako lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the W3C timetable, it is expected that HTML5 will reach the W3C recommendation by 2010
 haalanki, pratham public varking draft apni anumaanit tithi ke 8 maheene baad aa paaya tha or antim kol and candidate anushansa ke 2008 tak pahunchne kii ummid thi, lekin july 2010 ke anusaar achtmal5, W3C main abhi bhi varking draft str par hi he
 HTML5 is at last call level in WHATWG since October 2009
 achtmal5 vinirdesh ke sampadak ian hikson ko ummid he ki ye vinirdesh 2012 ke dauraan candidate anushansa str tak pahunch jaayenge
 in vinirdesh ke W3C anushansa banane ke liye nimna maandand aavashyak he - "do 100% purna tathaa puri tareeke se antahsanchalit kriyanvayan"
techripublic ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main hikson ne anumaan lagaaya he ki yah sambhawatah varsh 2022 yaa uske baad hi ho paayegaa
 haalanki, vinirdesh ke kai bhaag sthir hai or utpaadon main unhen karyanvit kiya ja saktaa he: Some sections are already relatively stable and there are implementations that are already quite close to completion, and those features can be used today
 – WHAT Working Group, When will HTML5 be finished?, FAQ HTML5 introduces many elements and features that reflect the common use of modern websites
 unamem se kuch hai, generik block ke saamaanya upyog ke liye cementic riplacement tathaa inline eliments, udhaaharan ke liye, , yaa kii bajaay or 
achtmal 4
01 se or jaise kuch vishuddh rup se pradarshni or bekaar tatwon ko hataa diya gaya he; in tatwon ke prabhaavon ko kescading style shits kaa upyog karke bhi hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 The importance of DOM scripting in web practice is being re-emphasized
 markup kii samanta ke baavjood, achtmal5 sintex ab SGML par aadhaarit nahin rah gaya he
 However, it is designed to be backwards compatible with the common parsing of earlier versions of HTML
 yah ek nai parichayatmak line ke saath aata he jo ki ek SGML dastavej prakaar kii ghoshnaa,, jaisaa dikhaai detaa he, jo ki standard-complaayent rendoring mod ko shuru karata he
 HTML5 also incorporates other specifications of WHATWG Web Forms 2
0
 markup nirdisht karne ke alaava, achtmal5 scrypting aplicoshan programing interfesej ko bhi nirdisht karata he
 Existing document object model interfaces are extended and documented with real features
 nae epiai bhi maujuud hai, jaise ki: All of the above technologies are not included in the W3C HTML5 specification, although they are included in the WHATWG HTML specification
 kuch sambandhit praudyogikiyaan jo W3C achtmal5 yaa WHATWG achtmal vinirdesan kaa hissaa nahin hai, is prakaar hai: The W3C publishes the specifications for these separately
 bhinnataaon or kuch vishisht udaahranon kii suchi nimna prakaar se he

 XML documents must be rendered with an XML Internet media type, such as application / xhtml + xml or application / xml
 xml's strict, well-built syntax browser for XHTML5 demonstrates flexibility in handling incorrect syntax
 achtmal5 ko is hisaab se banaaya gaya he ki puraane brouzar nae achtmal5 constructs kii surakshit tareeke se upeksha kar sakate hai
 Unlike HTML 4
01, the HTML5 specification provides detailed rules for lexing and parsing, which are intended to provide the same result to all analog browsers in case of incorrect syntax
 haalanki achtmal5 ab "tag soup" dastavejon ke liye sangat vyavhaar ko paribhaashit karata he, un dastavejon ko achtmal5 maanak ke anuroop ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he

 Bullets generally do not contain explosives, but they penetrate their targets with full effect and damage them
 shabd "goli" kaa upyog kabhi kabhi barood, yaa ek kaartoos ke liye bhi aamtaur par kiya jaataa he, jo goli, khol, powder or primer kaa mishran hota he
 Therefore, the use of the word "bullet" to describe ammunition or cartridges is not technically correct
 goliyon kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna ki banduukon kaa
 Originally, bullets were balls of metal or stone that were used as a weapon and in a slingshot for hunting
 ant main jab banduukon kaa vikaas ho gaya, inhen choti gendon ko ek band tub ke ant main gan powder ke ek visphotak charge ke saamne rakhaa jane laga
 As the gun became more technologically advanced, from 1500 to 1800 there was little change in the bullets
 ve sise kii saadhaaran round gende hoti thim, jinhen rounds kaha jaataa tha, inke keval vyas main bhinnata milti thi
 Molded lead balls were used as projections with the development of hand culverines and matchlock archwebs
 The word "bullet" is derived from the French word Bullette, which means small ball
 bandook main prayukt mul goli ek gol sise kii gend thi jo ek bor se choti hoti thi, ise deele feet paper ke ptch main lapeta jaataa tha, jo beral main powder ke upar goli ko dridhtaa se pakad letaa tha
 Was called isiilie, puraane smood bor brown base or isi tarah kii sainya banduukon ke saath, goliyon ko bandook main lod karnaa aasaan hota tha
 On the other hand, the original funnel-loading rifle, in which the bullets were fitted more closely to rifle the grooves, was more difficult to load, especially when the barrel bore had deteriorated from previous firing
 For that reason, early rifles were not used for military purposes
 unnisvin sadi kii pehle pachaas saalon main goli kii akruti or kaaryon main vishisht parivartan dekhe gaye
 In 1826, Delvigne, a French infantry officer, invented a breech with unconnected shoulders, on which a circular bullet was injected until it was loaded into the grooves of the rifle
 haalanki, delvigne kaa tarika thik nahin tha or isane goli ko vikrut kar diya
 The first bullet in a series of pointed or "cone-shaped" bullets was designed in 1823 by Captain John Norton of the British Army
 norton kii goli main ek khokhla aadhaar tha jo bairal kii rifling ke liye, firing karne par dabaav ke saath fail jaataa tha
 The British Ordnance Board disapproved of it as the circular bullet was in use for the last 300 years
 prasiddh angreji bandook banane vaale wiliam greenar ne 1836 main greenar goli kaa avishkaar kiya
 It was very similar to Norton's bullet, with one difference being that its hollow base was fitted with a wooden plug that exerted more definite pressure on the base to expand and hold the rifling
 pareekshan se yah sabit ho gaya ki greenar kii goli bahut prabhavi thi lekin ise sainya upyog ke liye asweekrut kar diya gaya kyonki, yah mana gaya ki do bhaag hone ke kaaran iskaa nirmaan bahut mushkil he
 The soft lead mini ball was released in 1847 by Claude Attini Mini, a captain of the French Army
 yah lagbhag greenar goli ke samaan thi
 The Mini was designed by a cone-shaped bullet with a hollow cavity in its rear, with a small iron cap fitted instead of a wooden plug
 jab isse fire kiya jaataa tha yani goli chalayi jaati thi, to lohe kii topi bullate ke rear par khokhli gupha main chali jaati thi, jiske dwaara rafiling ko majboot karne ke liye bullate ke said fail jate the
 In 1855, the British adopted a mini ball for their Enfield rifle
 mini ball kaa pehali baar sabase zyada istemaal america naagarik yuddh ke dauraan kiya gaya
 Roughly in this war, 90% of casualties were due to mini balls fired from rifles
 1854 or 1857 ke bich, sar joseph vitworth ne rifl par ek lambi shrinkhalaa main prayog kiye or anya binduon main, chote bor ke phaayde ko sabit kiya or, vishesh rup se, lambi goli ke phaayde ko bhi pramanit kiya
 Witworth's bullet was made in such a way that it could be mechanically fitted to the grooves of the rifle
 Witworth's pill was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866, when it was gradually replaced by Metford
 1862 ke aas paas or iske baad, dablyoo
 i
 metford ne bullate or rifl par kai prayog kiye or badhati hui sarpil ke saath lit rifling kii mahatvapurn pranali or ek sakht goli kaa avishkaar kiya
 The combined result was that in December 1888, lee-metford's small bore rifle, Mark I, was finally adopted by the British Army
 lee-metford, lee-enfield kii purvavarti thi
 The next significant change in the history of rifle bullets came in 1882, when Edward Rubin, director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented a copper-jacketed bullet — a long shot whose lead core was that of a copper
 Was kept in a jacket
 yah bhi chote bor vaali thi or yah 8mm kii "label bullate" kii purvarti he jise Mle 1886 kii label rifl ke dhune rahit powder barood ke liye apanaaya gaya tha
 The surface of lead bullets fired at high speed can melt due to hot gases present and friction with the bore
 kyonki tambe kaa galnaank ucch hota he or vishisht ushma or kathorta kaa maan bhi bhi adhik hota he, copper kii jacket main upasthit goliyon ke kaaran thuthan kii gati bad jaati he
 Modernized aerodynamics led to the development of the pointed Spitzer bullet
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat tak, duniya kii adhikansh senaayen spitzar bullate kii ore sankramit ho gayin thim
 These bullets could be fired more accurately and had more energy
 spitger bullate or mashin gan ke sangyojan ne yuddh kii ghaatkata ko bahut adhik badha diya
 The most modern refurbishment that took place in the shape of a bullet or bullet is a boat-like tail, a grounded base for the Spitzer bullet
 ucch jab hawa goli ke antim sire par teji se hokar jaati he, tab nirvaat utpann ho jaataa he, jisase projectile kaa veg kam ho jaataa he
 The design of the tailbone, such as a base boat, allows air to flow over the surface of its end, reducing the form drag
 iske parinamswaroop vayugatiki laabh ko vartmaan main rifl takanic ke liye anukool akruti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The first combination of the Spitzer and the boat-like tail bullet is named Bell "D" after its discoverer, it was released as standard military ammo in 1901, for the French-labeled Model 1886 rifle
 bullate ke dizin main do praathmik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karnaa he
 a seal with the bore of the gun should be made in them first
 If a strong seal is not made, the gas will leak from the propellant charge after the bullet is removed, which will reduce this efficiency
 bullate ko rifling kii prakriya main is tarah se kaam karnaa chahie ki bandook ke bor ko koi kshati naa pahunche
 The tablets should have a surface that forms this seal without causing too much friction
 bullate or bor ke bich is antarkriya ko aantarik prakshepiki kaha jaataa he
 Bullets should be produced at a high standard, as surface deformities may affect firing accuracy
 bairal se nikalne ke baad goli ko prabhavit karne vaali bhautikee, bahari prakshepiki kehalaati he
 Factors that affect the aerodynamics of a bullet flying are the shape of the bullet and the rotation caused by the rifling of the barrel of the gun
 ghurni bal goli ko vayugathik rup se or gayroscopy rup se sthirikrut karte hai
 Any asymmetry in a bullet or bullet is largely canceled out when it spins
 chikne bor kii banduukon ke saath, ek golakaar akruti anukool thi kyonki is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki yah kaise unmukh hui, isane ek samtal saamne vaale hisse ko prastut kiya
 These unstable bullets would collapse erratically, or roll backward and disastrously, providing only moderate accuracy, although the aerodynamic shape changed little over the centuries
 aam taur par, goli kii akritiyaan vayugatiki, aantarik prakshepiki jaruraton or antim prakshepiki aavashyaktaaon ke bich ek samjhauta thim
 Another method of stabilization for the pellet's mass center is to stay as far ahead as in practice in a mini ball or shuttlecock
 isse goli vayugatiki ke madhyam se saamne kii ore aage udaan bharti he
 See how the terminal ballistics and / or pill design affects its stopping ability, what happens when a bullet affects an object
 prabhaav ke parinaam kaa nirdhaaran lakshya saamagree ke sanghatan or ghanatv, aapatan kone or khud goli ke veg or bhautik gunon ke dwaara hota he
 The bullet is usually designed in such a way that it can penetrate, deform and / or break the target
 ek di gayi saamagree or goli ke liye, takaraane kaa veg vah praathmik kaarak he jo parinaam kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 In fact, there are many bullet shapes and they are of many types and a table can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet molds
 RCBS, kai nirmaataaon main se ek he, jo kai bhinn dizin pesh karata he, jo basic round ball se shuru hote hai
 With a mold, one can also make bullets at home to reload their shelled ammo, where local laws allow this
 haath se casting, haalaanki, thos sise kii goliyon ke liye keval samay- or laagat- prabhavi he
 Cast and jacketed bullets have also been commercially made available by numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than lead casting bullets
 thuthan se lod kii jane vaali banduukon yaa blike powder ke liye bulats ko shuddh sise se dhalaai karke banaaya jaataa tha
 This worked well for low speed bullets, which were fired at speeds less than 450 m / s
 aadhunik banduukon se fire kii jane vaali thodi si zyada gati kii goliyon ke liye, sise or tin kaa ek adhik sakht mishradhatu yaa tipasetter kaa sisa behatar he
 For more high-speed bullets, jacketed bullets are used
 in sabhi main saamaanya tatv sisa he, jiskaa upyog bade paimaane par kiya jaataa he kyonki iskaa ghanatv adhik hota he or isliye yah yah adhik dravyaman uplabdh karaata he- or is prakaar se, ek die gaye aaytan ke liye adhik gatij urja utpann karata he
 Lead is also cheap, it is easy to obtain, it is easy to work on, it melts at low temperatures, it is easy to use in making bullets or bullets for all these reasons
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki sisa vishaiylla hota he, jisase yah ek zyada khatarnaak hathiyaar ban jaataa he
 The 1868 Declaration of St
 Petersburg prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400 grams
 hegg kanvension virdohi paksh ke vardidhari sainya karmiyon ke khilaaf vardidhari sainya karmiyon ke dwaara vishesh prakaar ke barood ke upyog ko nishiddh karata he
 These include projectiles that explode within an individual, specific, and expanding bullet
 geneva sammelnon se sambandhit, vishesh paaramparik hathiyaaron par 1983 ke sammelan ke protocol III main, nagarikon ke khilaaf aag lagane vaale barood ke upyog ko nishiddh kiya gaya
 In these treaties, no one prohibits tracer or speaks of prohibited bullets in military equipment
 ye sandhiyaan yahan tak ki pistal, rifl or mashin gan main prayukt 
22 LR bulats par bhi lagu hoti hai
 Therefore, special bullets were developed during World War II for the high standard HDM pistol, a 
22 LR suppressed pistol, using bullets with full metal jackets instead of hollow point bullets, which
 22 were suitable for LR rounds

 Each of the galaxies boasts billions of stars
 gurutvkarshan taron ko ek saath band kar rakhata he or isi tarah anek gallexi ek saath milakar tara gucchh main rahati he
 Initially astronomers believed that the birth of new galaxies and quasars in the universe probably resulted from the explosion of old galaxies

 They pointed out that there are no explosive intercellular interactions between galaxies that can give rise to new galaxies
 adhikansh gallexiyon kaa centre taron se bharaa hua golakaar bhaag hota he, jise nabhik kaha jaataa he or yah nabhik apane chaaron ore ek taleey golakaar discs se juda hota he
 Astronomers mainly divide galaxies into three parts based on their size

 By counting the number of stars of different brightness, calculating their distance and measuring their speed, astrologers have made a very good estimate of the true form of the galaxy

 Some high-speed stars and spherical galaxies are outside the range of our galaxy, but they are also associated with our galaxy and are considered parts of the same
 About 100 spherical galaxies are known

 The center of the galaxy can be determined by the distribution of these galaxies

 oraanv yaa 'kudukh' bharat kii ek pramukh janajati hai
 They are resident in the central and eastern states of India and Bangladesh
 inaki bhashaa kaa naam bhi 'uraanv' yaa 'kudukh' he
 Oraon or Uraon is a tribal group in the Chota Nagpur region
 oraanv athwa uraanv naam is samooh ko duusare logon ne diya he
 In their lingua franca, the group describes itself as 'kurukh'
 angareji main 'o' akshar se likhe jane ke kaaran is samooh ke naam kaa uccharan 'oraanv' kiya jaataa he; bihar / chhattisgarh main 'uraanv' naam kaa prachlan adhik he
 The Uraon language belongs to the Dravidian family, which is completely different from the Munda languages of the adivasi tribal groups
 uraanv bhashaa or kannada main anek samtayein hai
 Possibly keeping these in mind, GATE in his 1901 census report had expressed the possibility that Uraons were originally residents of the Karnataka region
 unka anumaan tha ki is samooh ke purvaj pehle karnataka se narmada upatyaka main aae or vahaan se baad main bihar rajya ke son tat ke bhaagon main aakar bas gaye
 In the absence of sufficient evidence, it would not be appropriate to consider this inference as scientific
 adhikansh uraanv is samay ranchi jile ke madhya or pashchimi bhaag main rahete hai
 Late Sharachandra Rai, the first scientific scholar of the Uraon group, is of the opinion that in Bihar, they used to live in the middle of the Sone and Karmanasha rivers of Shahabad district
 yah kshetra 'kurukh desh' ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 The word Kurukh is possibly a distorted form of a root Dravidian word
 raay kaa anumaan he ki is mul shabd kaa arth 'manushya' rahaa hoga
 The economy of this group is basically dependent on agriculture

 The remaining two are divided tribes
 prayek gotra apane aapako ek vishisht purvaj kii santan maanata he, yadhyapi gotrachihn ko hi purvaj maanane kaa vishwaas unamem nahin paaya jaataa
 With regard to Gotrachain he believes that his ancestors had received some unforgettable help from him in ancient times, due to which the name of a section of the group became inseparably associated with him
 prayek gotra apane gotrachihnvaale praani, vriksh athwa padaarth kaa kisi bhi tarah upyog nahin karata
 To harm him in any way is also forbidden by his social rules
 yadi unka gotrachihn koi praani yaa pakshi he to ve na to uskaa shikaar karenge or na uskaa maance khaayenge
 Similarly, if their gotra is a tree, then they will not go under its shadow

 Lb) in the game of cricket is a method of dismissing a batsman
 ek ampire paristhitiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke antargat ek ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out qaraar detaa he, jab mukhyatah ballebaaj ke wicket se takaraa sakane vaali gend ballebaaj ke sharir se takaraati he
 The LBW rule was created so that the batsman does not use the body in place of his bat to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket
 elbeadblyoo ko saamanytah is khel ke sabase jatil niyam ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Despite the use of leg in the term leg before wicket, this rule applies even if the ball hits the batsman's other part of the body except for the bat's hand gloves
 elbeadblyoo kaa niyam 1744 tak cricket ke niyamon main shaamil nahin tha
 This rule was first used in 1774, according to which: If the batsman is considered out


 or else the batsman will stick his leg in front of the wicket to stop the ball and stop the ball from hitting the wicket
 jabaki elbeadblyoo niyam ke prayog kii shuruyaat nishchit rup se ballebaaj dwaara gend ko wicket se na takaraane dene ke liye jaanboojh kar taang va pair adaane ke kaaran hui thi, jon nairen jaise shuruaati lekhakon ne jaanboojh kar kiye jane vaale is kaam ke liye tom tailor tathaa joe ring ko jimmedaar mana he
 However, his career began after 1774 and, as Arthur Hegarth points out, "it is now impossible to reconcile these conflicting statements"
 isi vajah se elbeadblyoo ke niyam ko kai varshon tak record nahin kiya gaya tha
 John Toughton was dismissed by John Wells under LBW rule in the match of Surrey v England XI at Moulsey Hurst in August 1795
 hegarth ke anusaar: is match main, pehali baar aisa paaya gaya ki "pagabaadha" ko darj kiya gaya he 
brishar kii mudrit score-pustika main, is match main mi
 je
 tafton ko keval bold qaraar diya gaya he, tathaa note main pagabaadha likhaa gaya he
 In the beginning, when any batsman was out in this manner, it was only written that he was bowled and not pugged
 sankshep main is niyam kaa saar yah he: If the ball hits the batsman who was about to hit the wicket, it is called LBW, unless: dhyaan den: leg said se baahar padane vaali gendon se abhipraay yah he ki gend kaa pachaas pratishat yaa isse adhik hissaa leg stump ke baahar avashya hona chahie
 In addition, the ball hitting the batsman outside the off-stump must have a fifty percent or more hit against the batsman outside the off-stump line
 apni jatiltaaon ke baavjood, kaich evam bold ke pashchaat pagabaadha ) cricket main out karne kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar he
 Following are the conditions for declaring a batsman LBW: in sthitiyon kii vyakhya karne ke teen niyam hai: ke apwaad main ampaire kaa yah nirnay shaamil hota he ki ballebaaj ne gend ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya he athwa nahin
 This rule has been made so that the batsman does not just play the ball outside the off-stump on the pad, which eliminates the possibility of hitting the ball with the bat
 spin gendbaajon ke khilaaf ek aam rakshaatmak ranneeti of stump par gend se bachane ke liye pad kaa istemaal karnaa he, kintu elbeadblyoo niyam kaa matlab he ki unka balla pad ke najadik ho, jisase slip main khadey kshetrarakshakon ko kaich pakadaney kaa mauka mili, yaa unke elbeadblyoo out hone kii sambhaavna bane
 Some reviewers, such as Richie Bainod, have suggested that the LBW rule should be changed in such a way that the batsman can be called out even if he is slightly out of the leg stump, which will help the legspiners and avoid negative pad-play
 elbeadblyoo niyam kii samiksha hameshaa gendbaaj ke chor par khadey ampire dwaara kii jaati he
 If the fielding team believes that a batsman can be out lbw, they should request the umpire for a decision
 gend, jisase ballebaaj tak pahunchane main aadhe second kaa samay lagata he, ke liye sabhi elbeadblyoo sthitiyon kaa moolyankan kiya janaa chahie
 As in other aspects of the rules, the batsman is always given the benefit of any doubt, therefore, if the umpire is not satisfied, the request will be turned down
 For example if the batsman steps one before the ball hits the batsman
 Goes ahead
 ho saktaa he gend aage chal kar wicket se takaraa jaati, kintu ek ampaire ke liye is bare main sunishchit hona bahut mushkil he kyonki ballebaaj kii taang se takaraate samay gend wicket se 1
5-2 meter kii duuri par hogi
 Through television replays it is now easy to tell whether all the conditions of LBW were met and therefore some people complain that an umpire wrongly asked the batsman to continue the game or that he was wrongly Dubbed out
 haalanki ampire dwaara kisi ballebaaj ko out dene se pehle is bare main sunishchit hona chahie ki vah out he ki nahin or chunki unke paas tivi riple jaisi koi suvidha nahin hoti, atah ampire kaa nirnay aamtaur par uchit hota he
 Most players and commentators accept this decision and there is little criticism from umpires
 yakeenan elbeadblyoo kaa nirnay ampiron dwaara kiye jane vaale nirnyon main se sabase kathin he or yah darshakon ke bich tippanee or vivaad kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 In recent years, due to the increasing pressure in cricket and the money at stake, many have been emphasizing the role of cameras in uncertain cases and the use of simulation techniques such as the hawk-eye
 philhal, elbeadblyoo ek aisa nirnay he jo keval maidan par khadey ampaire dwaara liya jaataa he
 However, the wind has changed: In September 2005, the International Cricket Council authorized a test by umpires to aid decision-making through television replays
 
 It is worth noting that if the ball hits the pad first and then hits the bat, the batsman can be declared out lbw but if the batsman hits the ball with the bat and after that the ball hits his pad, The batsman cannot be declared out in that case
 haalanki, donon hi maamalon main, ek ballebaaj dwaara kaich out hone kaa khatra bana rahata he kyonki gend apekshaakrit dhimi gati se uchhal kar najdiki kshetrarakshak dwaara lapki ja sakati he
 If the ball hits the batsman without breaking, then in that case the umpire has to guess the direction of the ball by its speed and bounce, ignoring any possible deviations after the ball has been hit
 haalanki gend wicket se takaraayegi yaa nahin, yah nirdhaarit karne se pehle ampaire gend ke swing yaa pravaah ko dhyaan main rakh saktaa he
 If the ball is swinging, the umpire is allowed to guess whether the ball will swing in the same direction or not
 ek galatafahami he ki ballebaaj us sthiti main elbeadblyoo out nahin ho saktaa jab gend leg stump ke baahar tappa khaati he
 It is generally believed that a ball hitting the outside of the leg stump will result in a not out, however there is an exception in an unusual situation, according to the LBW law's exact definition and the current definition of no ball
 24
6 niyam ke tahat, ek gend ko tabhi vaid gend mana jayega agar yah do baar uchle
 36
1 niyam main kaha gaya he ki yadi, "tappa padane se pehle ise na rokane par, gend wicket se wicket ke bich sidhi rekha main yaa ballebaaj kii of said kii wicket se takaraati he" to us sthiti main ballebaaj elbeadblyoo out he
 "it is worth noting here that, in Rule 36
1, there is no mention of the leg side, nor does it state that such a condition occurs more than once
 Thus a ball that bounces twice may result in lbw
 Even if it is out of the line of a tapped leg stump
 No batsman has been dismissed in this manner in international cricket
 elbeadblyoo ek shabd he jiskaa prayog 21 navambar 1934 ko mericabone cricket club dwaara banaaye gaye pagabaadha niyam main badlaav kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It came into existence in England in 1935, but was opposed by higher level officials in Australia where it did not apply until the 1936 / 1937 season, although it was implemented in club matches during the 1935 / 1936 season in Australia
 Was tried to do
 is badlaav ke anusaar of stump se baahar tappa padane par bhi elbeadblyoo out ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he yadi wicket se wicket ke bich kii sidhi rekha main ballebaaj ise apane sharir ke kisi hisse se roktaa he
 Earlier, LBW could be dismissed only by the balls falling in the straight line between the bowler's end and the batsman's wickets
 shabd "elbeadblyoo " is tathy ko sanderbhit karata he ki 1935 se 1937 tak vijden dwaara prakashit scorcardon main nae pagabaadha niyam dwaara liye gaye wicket 1935 ke pehle ke niyamon ke viketon se alag darshaae gaye the
 During the 1920s and 1930s the characteristic of first-class cricket was the increasing dominance of the bowlers by the batsmen
 1926 / 1927 main emsiji par new south wales ke khilaaf victoria dwaara 1107 ranon ke vishwa record ke saath, 1920 ke dashak ke dauraan australia main ran banane kii dar asaadhaaran rup se adhik thi
 In 1928, the average cost of taking a wicket in county cricket was 30 runs, surpassing its previous high price of 1901 at 27
5
 elbeadblyoo nirnay kii anumati dwaara ranon kii sankhya ko rokane ke prayaas, bhale hi ballebaaj ne gend ko khelaa ho, ko 1929 main aanshik rup se safalataa mili thi, kintu 1930 ke test maichon ke dauraan atyadhik ucch ransankhya tathaa kai dra maichon se pataa chalata he ki yah keval kshanik prabhaav hi tha tathaa 1934 tak is prayog ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 It was clear to the officials that the batsmen who played good pad play like Herbert Sutcliffe and Phil Mead were responsible for the high runs and the increasing number of draw matches
 atah of stump se baahar padane vaali gendon ko pad dwaara rokane se bachaane kaa uddeshy na keval pad play kaa muqabla karnaa tha balki of stump par gend daalane vaale gendbaajon ko puraskrit karke tej "bodiline " gendbaaji ko hatotsahit karnaa bhi tha or isi kaaran of said main aakarshak stroke khilne ko protsaahan mila
 It was heavily scrutinized in 1934 and it was generally agreed that an extension of the LBW rule on the off side could reduce defensive pad play
 herold larwood jaise kuch logon ne of stump se bahaar padane vaali kisi bhi gend par elbeadblyoo qaraar die jane kii maang kii, bhale hi ballebaaj ke pair bhi of stump se baahar hi kyon na hon - jise 1970 ke baad se hi kuch had tak mana gaya he

 Tweb Hoeffel and Auck, giving a definition of fossilism, wrote: Paleontology is the science that explains the life of past geological ages revealed by the primitive plants and the putrid remains of animals
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki jeevashm vigyaan adikalin jeevajantuon kaa, une ashmibhoot avasheshon ke aadhaar par adhyayan karata he
 The word fossil itself indicates that there is a study of Jiva + Ashram
 angreji kaa Palaentology shabd bhi Palaios = pracheen + Onto = jeev ke adhyayan kaa nirdesh karata he
 The study of paleontology is a new branch of biology and it has developed over the last 200 years
 vigyaan kii is shakha ke vikaas ke bahut pehle se adimanav kii jaankaree main yah tha ki kuch prakaar ke shailon main ek vicitra prakaar ke avshesh paae jate hai jo samudri jeevon ke anuroop hote hai
 In the absence of knowledge, he first considered these relics as not having biological origin, but the contents of the humor of nature, which became due to some power inside the earth

 It is not possible under human capacity that all the world's sources of fossils are discovered

 Third, the geographical shape of the world as it is seen today, was not there in those days

 Therefore, the knowledge that we may or may have gained from their vulgar samples is different, or will be
 ant main yah kabhi sambhav nahin he ki jitne bhi jeevajantu itihaas ke us andhkaar yug main upasthit the, un sabakaa ashmikaran ho hi gaya ho
 There are some conditions of vulgarization, due to which the dead bodies of the fauna are vulgarized
 sabhi jeevon kaa ashmikaran na to aavyashyak hi he, na hi sambhav he
 For this reason too, it is difficult to write a series history of the life of the primitive creatures
 ab tak jitne bhi jeevashmiya pramaan hamen praapt ho chuke hai, unke aadhaar par jeevon ke kramik vikaas par acha khaasaa prakaash padataa he
 The study of fossils gives us an idea of the organisms which are now either extinct, or their present form has changed enough
 jeevashm pracheen jeevon ke ve avshesh hai, jo shilakhandon yaa anya sthanon par pathar jaise ho gaye hai
 Some such remains of creatures have also been found, which are in their original form rather than preserved
 himsagariya kshetron main praapt maimathon tathaa anya jantuon ke mrit sharir rus tathaa england or america ke sangrahalayon main surakshit hai
 Fossils also resemble, in modular form, the shape of modern organisms
 jeevashm keval avsaadee shilakhandon main hi mila karte hai
 After the death of many types of animals, the depression that accumulates on their dead bodies after death, they become fossils only over time
 kuch jeevashm to itane purna hai ki unki anvikshikeey pariksha karne par jeevon kii koshika tak kii rachanaayen spasht dikh padati hai
 It is not necessary to get obscene evidence of the living as its living body
 unke shavon main sadandh, oxikaran, hinsak jeevon dwaara vikrut kar dene, sheet, varsha, dhoop aadi ke kaaran vikaar utpann ho jaataa he
 Some animals, whose bodies are made up of inorganic materials such as calcium carbonate, silica, etc
, have relatively little effect on the disorder
 aise jeevon ke jeevashm bahut kam sankhya main uplabdh hai
 Even those that are available are incomplete to compare with modern living organisms
 jeevon kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi he ki ek prakaar ke jeevashm kuch vishesh prakaar ke shilakhandon main hi milte hai
 From these rocks, knowledge of the environment of the entire life of fossils is obtained
 jeevashmon se yah bhi maaloom hota he ki jeev kaise sthaan par rahaa karata tha or kya khaataa-peetaa tha
 They also throw light on the then geographical conditions

 Over time, they become so rigid that if the upper shell is broken, then an image-like replica goes inside

 These footprints do not only know the composition and shape of the soles of the feet of the animals, but also the direction of their movement

 Some of its major utilities are: kalanukramik -jeevashmon main utkeern athwa sampurna yaa apurna rup main praapt pramaanon ke aadhaar par pracheen bhugarbhik avasthaa kaa pataa chalata he
 Fossils are of great help in determining a geologic period
 stareey sthiti athwa staran vinyas kaa jeevashmon se avichhinn sambandh mana gaya he
 The physico-chemical changes that have taken place on the earth, almost the same changes are happening today

 His appearance was great, it has made a difference
 khanij padaarthon kii prakruti purvawat hoti hui bhi carbonic padaarthon kii prakruti parivartansheel rahi he
 Therefore, it is difficult to determine their antiquity with mineral-rich rocks
 kintu unke bich praapt jeevashmon ke avsaadon kaa adhyayan karne par yah kaary saral ho jaataa he
 Some fossils have been referred to as instructional fossils on the basis that they prove that certain animals or vegetation originated or may have occurred only in geological times
 aadim parivesh -jeevon ke jivan ke liye, chaahe ve vanaspatiyaan ho, chaahe jaanavar, vishesh prakaar ke bhugolic vaataavaran hi upyukt hote hai
 In other words, we can say that animals of a particular kind survive in a particular environment
 jeevashmon se pataa chalata he ki tatkaaleen jeev jantuon ke jeevanyaapan ke liye kis prakaar kaa bhugolic vaataavaran tha
 Fossils also give a glimpse of how these animals died or at what place at which stage
 iske saath hi pracheen bhoomi, sagar, jalashay aadi kii seemaa tathaa vistaar, jantuon or pakshiyon ke parvrajan aadi par bhi jeevashm prachur prakaash daalate hai
 The result of the study of these fossils is that the composition of ancient geographical maps can be simple and accessible
 jeevashmon dwaara prakat bhugolic parivesh ke adhyayan ke liye ab ek naveen vigyaan kaa janm ho chukaa he, jise purabhugol kehete hai
 Ancient Ecology - Living beings need a wide variety of environments to survive
 kuch jeev anya jeevon ke sharir ke upar yaa bheetar rahakar jeevanyaapan karte hai; inhen paraseete yaa parashrayi kehete hai
 Some organisms spend their lives in close contact with or engaging with other organisms
 jeevashmon dwaara jeev jantuon ke is ant:sambandh kaa gyaan hamen sahaj hi ho jaataa he
 Evolution of organisms - Charitable evidence is one of the corroborative evidence or arguments that his supporters present to confirm Darwin's theory of evolution of organisms
 prayek jeevashm apane aap main jeevvishesh kii apni satta kaa swayan pramaan he
 Their studies throw a lot of light on their gradual development
 jeevashmon ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki pracheen kaal main ek aisa bhi samay tha, jab dinasur daityakaar jantuon se prithvi aakraant thi, athwa seelakanthas machhliyon ke jivit avshesh ab sambhavat: samaapt ho chale hai
 Similarly, solutions to many other problems related to growth have been fossilized
 jeevashm vigyaan kai shakhaon main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 From the convenience point of view, it has now become a rule that when we use the word 'fossilology', we only mean the study of fossils of invertebrates
 jeevashmiki kii jis shakha ke antargat kasheruk jeevashmon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he use kasheruki jeevashm vigyaan kehete hai
 Plant fossils are studied under a different branch called phytosemiology
 aadhunik samay main jeevashmiki kii kuch anya pramukh shakhaon kaa bhi vikaas hua he, jinke adhyayan kaa kshetra kramash: ati laghu jeev or jeevashm maanav hai
 The field of paleontology is very wide and its limits cannot be determined definitively
 yadi saidhantik drushti se dekha jaae, to jeevashmiki kaa abhyuday prithvi par jeev ke pradurbhaav ke saath saath prarambh ho jaataa he, parantu bhoumikeey aadhaar par keval itnaa hi kaha saktaa he ki prithvi par sampurna jeev ke itihaas ke aadhe, yaa usase bhi kam ke, jeevon ke abhilekh hamen milte hai
 The beginning of fossil scientific investigations can be done from the oldest attainable fossils whose biological properties can be described on biological basis
 jeevashmiki kaa bhoumiki, visheshkar starit-shail-bhoumiki, se ati ghanishtha sambandh he
 Remnants of past living creatures are found in layered rocks
 in shailon ke nirmaan ke vishay main or unka anukram sthapit karne main unamem paae janevaale jeevashm bahut sahaayak siddh hue hai
 Actually layered-shell-geology without fossils is, in a way, practical paleontology
 jeevashmiki kaa jaiviki ke saath ghanishtha sambandh he
 Current biology and plants are studied under biology, while in biology, organisms and plants of geological ages that once lived and are now available only as fossils are studied
 lekin jeevashmiki ko jaiviki kii ek shakha nahin mana ja saktaa he, kyonki jeevashmiki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah kaa dhang jaiviki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah ke dhang se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Determining where fossilology can be separated from biology is often impossible
 parantu mote taur se jeevashm kaa ant or jaiviki kaa prarambh atyant-nutan yug or aadhunik yug ke sandhisthan se le sakate hai
 In this way, there are many and different types of fauna remains found between the indeterminate and suspicious pre-cambrian prehistoric animals and plants and between the present and certain types of organisms and plants, which throw light on the organism
 bhuparpati ke avsaadee shailon main milanevaale ye jeevashm hi, jeevashmiki ke adhyayan ke aadhaar hai
 Biologists are very interested in paleontology because it is closely related to a subject like biology
 praaniyon or padpon kii jatiyon kaa itihaas athwa jativrutt, starit shailon ke anukramit staron se praapt kiye jeevashmon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par adhik vishwaspurvak anurekhit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, due to incomplete record of organisms, the tracing of their genealogies is highly hindered, as only a few of the animals and plants found in the geological ages and most of them in incomplete condition are found reflected in these rocks
 abhilekh kii is apurnataa ke baavjood anek jeevavarg main, jab unka anurekhan shailon ke ek str se duusare str main kiya jaataa he tab, shanai: shanai: parivartan hone lagate hai
 When the patterns of fossils are collected from different indexed levels, the two distinctly visible species are directly related to the interstitial fossils and the fossils of intermediate levels ranging from the lowest found species to the highest
 Changes in the life of animals can be seen
 jeevashmon se jativrutt kaa pataa lagane ke liye, stareey reeti ke atirikt sharir tathaa vyativrutt kii tulanaatmak ritiyon kaa bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence, fossilism confirms the notion that biology developed as a result of changes occurring gradually
 is baat ke bataane kaa bhi pramaan he ki jeev vikaas niyatvikasiya tha
 This is to say that the biologic changes in the class of certain organisms occurred in a certain direction till ages and apart from this, the associated classes which are of the same ancestral origin, without being influenced by each other and external conditions, are similar in their evolution
 Stages or similar states, indicating that the direction of development in the various classes of organisms, By Vj is determined by paternal qualities
 jivit padpon or praaniyon kaa eckoshika andey se le karke antim dasha tak vikaas kii sampurna avasthaaon kaa anurekhan karnaa, bhraumiki or jeevaritti ke antargat aata he
 The evolution of the species of plants and animals of a class is almost the same, at least in its early stages, and the entire embryos within a class have so much homogeneity in one state until another that they cannot be separated

 The reality of this is seen in vertebrates, whose embryos can be separated from each other with great difficulty in the initial stages and which very slowly bear the characteristic figures of their class or body
 in bhruneey anveshanon ke parinaamon kaa jeevashmiki ke saath vishesh sambandh he
 There are many fossils in the information that show signs of embryonic, or at least, fleshy, or adolescent, compared to modern organisms related to themselves
 isprakaar ke aadim awa bhruneey prakaaron ke udhaaharan kasherukon main vishesh karke dekhne ko milte hai, kyonki inamen kankal jivan ke ati praarambhik kaal hi main ashmibhoot ho jate hai
 Therefore, the late stages of modern organisms can be directly compared with adult fossils
 jeevashmon ko nishchit naam dena jeevashm vigyaani ke liye isliye mahatv kaa he ki jeevashmon main vah adhik yatharth vibhed kar sake
 The nomenclature of fossils is generally based on the same principles on which creatures
 pranijagat anek sanghon main vibhakt he or prayek sangh anek virgon, ganon, kulon, vanshon or jatiyon main vibhakt he
 There are many types of fossils
 yadi anveshak kisi jati ke jeevashm ke ek praturup ke aadhaar par us sampurna jati kaa varnan karata he, to vah jeevashm praturup us jati kaa naam praroop kehalaata he
 If the investigator takes the help of other fossil specimens to determine the name of one, these additional specimens are called paratypes
 yadi anveshak bina namprarup kaa nishchay kiye hi kai anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in jeevashm namoonon ko sahpraroop kehete hai
 If the fossil form of a caste is chosen after the initial description of that caste, then the fossil type is called the lectotype
 jis prakaar ek jati ke varnan ke liye jeevashm namoonay hote hai usee prakaar ek vansh ke varnan ke liye praroop jati athwa samajini jeevashm hote hai
 If an investigator describes a new lineage based on a particular race, then that caste becomes a genholotype for that lineage
 yadi anveshak nae vansh ke varnan main aisi jatiyon kii suchi de detaa he jinako vah yah samajhataa he ki ve nae vansh ke antargat aate hai, to in sab jatiyon ko jenocentip kehete hai
 Many of the genosyntypes can be sorted later by the ADI investigator or later by another investigator

 The division of these five mahakalpas of the geological period is mainly based on the fossils of animals and plants found in these mahakalpas

 There were no animals and plants of any kind in this great cycle

 In Pragjivik Mahakalpa, very simple organisms like protozoa came into existence

 Therefore, fossils are not found even in the rocks of Pragjivan Mahakalpa
 anya teenon mahakalp, arthath purajivi mahakalp madhyajivi mahakalp or nutanjivi mahakalp jeevashmamay hai
 All the divisions from small to large that come under these great concepts are based solely on the fossils of the organisms found in that period

 Representative fossils of almost all major invertebrates are found in the Cambrian strata, and some of them, such as the trilobite, were more developed than they were in the Adicambrian period

 It is conceivable that all kinds of beings lived in the pre-cambrian seas, but they were all Komalangi ancestors, who have not left any signs of their existence

 But it is surprising that the remains of plants have not been found in the levels of the archaeological Mahakalpa

 After the sequence of complete rocks was well established and the fossils found in them were identified, it was found that there was gradual progress in the development of organisms

 Thus representatives of entire invertebrate associations, which are preserved in fossil form, are found in Cambrian rocks, but the organisms found under each association were often similar in their composition and showed very little change

 The vertebrates are the Cyclosotomata class, considered primitive classes based on composition, which first emerged and were followed by fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, respectively, and these classes appeared in the same order as expected from their creation

 The study of the development of the horse is a good example for rendering biologic theory
 vah sampurna saamagree jis par ghode ke vikaas kaa itihaas aadhaarit he, uttari america ke tritiyak shailon se praapt kii gai he
 The main directions of its development are: aakaar main vruddhi, gati main vruddhi, sir or greeva main vruddhi
 The oldest fossil of the horse is the Eohypus, which has been found in the lower Eocene rocks and was in shape from cat to fox
 madhya iosin kaa ghoda orohipus ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo aakaar main iohipus se kuch hi bada tha
 Answer: The horse of the Eocene is called Ephippus, the subject of which is not fully known
 mesohipus ke naam se prachlit ghoda, nimnatar or madhya oligosin shailon main miltaa he
 It was equal to, or somewhat smaller than, a lamb in size
 myohipus, jo uttar oligosin or nimnatar myosin yug main paaya jaataa tha, bhed se kuch hi bade aakaar kaa tha
 Parahippus was very abundant in the lower Myocene age
 madhya myosin kaa ghoda, mericups kehalaata tha
 Which was similar to Parahippus itself
 plyosin yug kaa ghoda, plyohipus aakaar main gadhe ke baraabar tha, par tritiyak yug main milanevaala ghada vartmaan kaal main paae janevaale ghode ke baraabar tha
 Thus we see that the size of the horse increased gradually
 isi prakaar ghode kii bahu or padon kii aantarik rachana main parivartan se uski gati main vruddhi hui
 The main symptom of this change was the degeneration of the lateral parts and the expansion and enlargement of the central or axial part, so that it could bear the burden with firmness while running
 isi prakaar kalai ke bich kii haddi ko chhodkar anya sabakaa hraas ho gaya, jisase kalai drudh ho gai
 Similarly, the third finger grew, other nearby fingers disappeared and only that remains in the end
 isi prakaar sir or greeva main dhire dhire vruddhi hui, jisase ghoda sugamawa se char sake

 " In addition to the white people disapproved of by the whites he has reviewed, Bedermann says that in all likelihood, Burrows was not trying to make any sort of rhetoric for either of them
 "unhone sambhavatya unamem main se kisi ke bare main kabhi nahin suna he
 "instead, Bedermann writes that Burrows proves his point because telling racist and sexy stories that insist on killing black people was not at all unusual, but instead just a typical 1912 version White was American

 lager ek aisa yantra he jo prerit utsarjan ek prakriya ke madhyam se prakaash utsarjit karata he
 The term laser is the acronym for radiation by induced emission of light amplification
 lager prakaash aamtaur par aakashik rup se shashakt, hote hai, jiskaa arth he ki prakaash yaa to ek sankare, nimna pravaahit kiran ke rup main niklegi, yaa use dekhne vaale yantron jaise lens lainson kii madad se ek kar diya jayega
 Typically, laser refers to the light emanating from a narrow wavelength lighthouse
 yah arth sabhi lejaron ke liye sahi nahin he, haalanki kuch lager vyapak prakashpunj kii tarah prakaash utsarjit karte hai, jabaki kuch kai prakaar ke vishisht tarangadairghy par saath saath prakaash utsarjit karte hai
 The emission of the conventional laser has a specific concentration
 prakaash ke adhiktar anya strot asangat prakaash utsarjit karte hai jinamein vibhinn charan hote hai or jo samay or sthaan ke saath nirantar badalata rahata he
 The term laser originated as an abbreviation for the emission of radiation induced by light amplification
 The word light in this sentence has a wider meaning, it does not refer only to the electromagnetic radiation of a visible light
 Therefore infrared laser, ultraviolet laser x -ray lasers, etc
 are light, microsomes equivalent to lasers, Messer, was first developed, Ace Equipment i ancient literature that emit microwaves and radio frequencies are called M, particularly from researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories, the laser was often called optical maser
 lekin is shabd kaa prayog ab chalan main nahin he or 1998 se bel prayogshaala bhi leisure shabd kaa prayog karti he
 The reconstructed verb laser means "generating a laser beam" or "applying laser light to an object"
 Sometimes the term "laser" is used to describe other optical techniques
 For example, uncomplicated state The source of the molecules in is called a "molecule laser"
 lager ek atyadhik paravartak taliya chhidr ke andar laabh madhyam se bana hota he, saath hi isamen laabh madhyam ko urja pradaan karne kaa madhyam bhi hota he
 The gain medium is a material with properties that allow light amplification by induced emission
 iske saralatam rup main, ek chhidr main do darpanon kii aisi vyavastha hoti he jisamen har baar laabh madhyam se guzarate hue prakaash aage peeche uchhalati rahati he
 One of the two mirrors in particular, the coupler produced, is partially transparent
 utpaadit lesar kiran is darpan ke madhyam se utsarjit hoti he
 Light with a specific wavelength that passes through the gain medium is amplified; Surround mirrors ensure that most light passes through the gain medium multiple times, to be amplified repeatedly
 prakaash kaa vah bhaag jo darpan ke bich main rahata he vah aanshik rup se paardarshee darpan se gujarata he or prakaash kii kiran ke rup main batch ke nikalataa he
 The process of supplying the energy required for amplification is called pumping
 khaas taur par yah urja bidyut dhara ke rup main yaa vibhinn tarangadairghy ke prakaash ke rup main aapurti kii jaati he
 Such light can be provided by a glowing lamp or another laser
 adhikansh vyaavhaarik lesron main atirikt tatv shaamil hote hai jo unke gunon jaise utsarjit prakaash kaa tarangadairya or kiran kaa aakaar ko prabhavit karte hai
 The gain medium of a laser is a material with controlled purity, size, concentration, which amplifies the beam through the process of induced emission
 yah kisi bhi avasthaa main ho saktaa he: gas, taral, thos yaa plasma 
yah laabh madhyam badhaaye gaye urja ko avashoshit karti he, jo kuch electronon ko ucch urja main badhaati he ") pramaatra avasthaa i photons ko sokhkar yaa photons utsarjit karke kan prakaash ke saath ghul mil sakate hai
 Emissions may be spontaneous or induced
 baad ke maamle main, photone usee disha main utsarjit hota he jis disha se prakaash gujarata he
 When the number of particles in an excited state exceeds the number of particles in some low energy state, the population is degraded and the induced emission speed due to light passing through it exceeds the amount of light absorption I
 Eventually, light is amplified

 Another method of obtaining the pulsed laser method is to pump a laser material that has a source that is pulsed by itself, either a case of a glowing lamp when the electron is absorbed, or another laser that is already Pulsed
 Historically pulsed pumping was used in dye lasers where the inverse population life of a dye molecule was so short that it had a high energy content
 a power pump was required
 To overcome this problem, a large capacitor is charged and then discharged through a glowing lamp, which pumps a glow beam like a wide beam

 As the idea developed, the focus shifted from infrared frequencies to more visible light instead
 This concept was originally a " Was referred to as "optical moser
" One year later, Bell Laboratory proposed a monopoly application for the proposed optical moser
 Did i Schawlow and Townes sent a manuscript physical review of theoretical calculations, which was published the same year his paper
 
 In those days Gordon Gould, a graduate student at Columbia University, was working on a doctoral research paper on the energy levels of excited thallium
 Gould and Towns met on the general topic of radiation emissions
 In November 1957, Gould called the "laser" Wrote your thoughts related to the suggestion of using an open resonator which is an important component for future lasers

 He continued to work on his idea and filed a patent application in April 1959
 The US Patent Office rejected his application and This patent was given to Bell Laboratory in 1960
 It sparked a legal battle that lasted for 28 years and brought scientific prestige and more money
 And i Gould won his first short patent in 1977, but could not claim his first patent victory until 1987, until a federal judge issued him a patent for optically pumped lasers and gas-fired lasers
