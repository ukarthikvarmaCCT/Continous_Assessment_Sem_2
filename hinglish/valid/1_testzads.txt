1937-45 ke madhya lade gaye yuddh ko dwitiya china-japan yuddh kaha jaataa he
 Japan made China the main target of its imperialism and first in Korea it exercised its power with China
 korea apni bhugolic sthiti ke kaaran saamaajik or raajnneetik drushti se japan ke liye atyant mahatvapurn tha
 Therefore Japan had a great interest in the Korea Peninsula
 china ke manchu samraaton ne 17veen shatabdi main korea par adhikaar kar liya tha or tabhi se korea china kaa adheen pradesh mana jaataa tha
 Although Korea had its own separate king, the independent king of Korea accepted the suzerainty of the emperor of China
 is tarah korea kaa rajya china ke ek sangrakshit rajya ke samaan tha
 Japan had a traditional interest in the Korea Peninsula but, as of now, Japan did not get a chance to fulfill this interest
 kintu ab japan main sainikwaad kaa janm ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, it became necessary to follow the radical policy regarding Korea
 is samay korea europea rajyon kii samrajyavaadee niti ke bhanvarjaal main fas rahaa tha, aisi sthiti main korea china ke haath se nikalakar kisi bhi europea desh ke adhikaar main ja saktaa tha
 So Japan's anxiety grew and he decided that he could not leave Korea to his fate
 1875 i
 main japan kaa ek jahaaj korea ke samudratat par pahunchaa
 The Korean government began shelling the ship
 is kaaran ugravadi japani netaa korea ke viruddh yuddh ghoshit karne kii maang karne lage
 However, the Japanese authorities at that time acted with restraint
 korea ke viruddh yuddh chhedane ke badale unhone nishchay kiya ki japan ek dootmandal korea bheje, jo vahaan kii sarkaar ko japan ke saath niyamanusaar vyapaarik sandhi karne ke liye prerit kare
 This messenger reached the capital of Korea in 1876 AD and Korea opened up trade to Japan, thus Japan gained many trading privileges
 japan ko korea main rajyakshetrathit adhikaar bhi mila or usne korea kii swatantra satta ko manyata de di
 This was a challenge to Chinese sovereignty, but as a result, the Japanese settled in Korea
 is prakaar kuch samay ke liye korea main shanti ho gai, lekin china-japan kaa manmutav chalata hi rahaa
 In 1891, Russia took a loan from France and decided to build a thirty-five hundred mile long Trans Siberian railway
 iske liye vah dakshin korea main adda bananaa chahta tha
 This made Japan's ears stand up
 isi bich korea main 1894 i
 main ek vidroh ho gaya
 This rebellion, led by the Tonghaq party, was mainly against foreigners
 shahi fouj ise dabaane main asamarth rahi
 Therefore, he asked for help from China
 china kii sarkaar ne chini sainikon kaa ek dasta bhej diya, kintu 1885 i
 ke samjhaute ke anusaar japan ko isaki soochna pehle na dekar baad main di
 Japan protested that such a large number of Chinese troops arriving in Korea was against the terms of the treaty
 badale main japani shaskaon ne bhi china ko vidhivat suchit kar saat hajaar sainik korea bhej die
 Even before the forces of China and Japan entered Korea, the government of Korea suppressed the rebellion
 kintu korea kii bhoomi par do videshi senaayen dati raheen
 It seemed that war would break out between the two at any moment
 agast 1894 i
 main ek chini jahaaj chini sainikon sahit korea kii ore ja rahaa tha
 Japan caught him en route and, since the said ship did not surrender, he was attacked, as a result every Chinese passenger was immersed in the sea
 is ghatana se kshubdh hokar china ne 1 agast, 1894 ko japan ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di or is prakaar pratham china-japan yuddh aarambh ho gaya
 This war lasted for about nine months in which the Japanese won
 japan kii sainik taiyaariyaan bahut hi shreshth thim
 One and a half million army of Japan were given excellent training
 japani sainikon ko yathasambhav vetan miltaa tha or unke general anbhavi or atyant yogya the
 They got ammunition and other logistics items in time and as needed
 japani nausena main paryaapt sankhya main yatri jahaaj the, jo sena athwa yuddh saamagree ek rakshanetra se duusare main shighrata se pahunchaaya karte the
 In contrast, China's military was completely useless
 uske paas na shastr the or na uske sainik prashikshit the tathaa sainikon ko niyamit vetan bhi nahin miltaa tha
 His commanders were also disqualified
 iske atirikt china kaa shashan prabandh bhi dooshit or bhrasht tha
 In such a situation, China's defeat was inevitable
 vastutah, yuddh ke prarambh or ant tak kabhi or china ko koi safalataa praapt nahin hui
 By the end of September, the Chinese army had to flee Korea and the Yalu River encounter was severely defeated by the Chinese fleet
 japan kii ek sena ne manchuriya par or duusari ne liyaotung prayadweep par akraman kiya

 At the time of independence, Pakistan had no national anthem
 isliye jab bhi dhvaj vandan hota " pakistan jindabad, azaadi pindabad" ke naare lagate the
 Jinnah did not accept this
 ve chaahate the ki pakistan ke raashtra-geet ko rachane kaa kaam sheeghra hi puraa karnaa chahie
 His advice cars suggested him the names of many famous Urdu poets who could have composed the song
 lekin jinnah kii soch kuch ore hi thi
 He felt that this is a good chance to establish the secular image of Pakistan before the world
 isliye unhone lahore ke mahanaurdu shaayar or mul hindu jagannatha azaad ko kaha ki "main aapako paanch din kaa hi samay de saktaa hu, aap pakistan ke liye raashtra-geet likhen"

 But they were helpless before Jinnah's wish

 The lyrics were - i sarazami e pakjarre tere hai ajasitaro se tabanakaroshan he kehkashan se kahinaj teri khaak Jinnah recognized it as a national song and the song remained a national song till his death

 He gave a periodic classification of elements
 is sarini kaa prayog kar unhone un tatwon ke gunon kaa bhi pataa lagaaya jisaki usne samay tak khoj nahin ho saki thi
 Mendleaf was born in the city of Tobolsk, Siberia
 inke pita kaa naam evan polvovich mendlif or mata kaa naam maaria damitriyevna mendlif tha
 His grandfather Pavel Maximovich was a pastor in a church in Sokolov, Russia
 unki aarmabhik shiksha tobolsk jimnajium main hui
 At the age of just thirteen, his father passed away and his factory burned in a fire
 sampatti nasht hone ke kaaran unke parivaar ko 1849 main saint petersburg main sharan lenaa padaa, jahaan mendlif ne main padagogial institute main pravesh liya
 In 1857, Mendeleev passed the graduate examination from Petersburg and received a gold medal

 On his return from travel, he received the post of professor at the Petersburg Technological Institute and two years later became a professor of chemistry at the University of Petersburg
 yahan rahakar inhone 23 varsh vaigyanik kaary or adhyaapan kiya
 In 1893, Mendeleev was appointed to the post of director of 'burets and Measures'
 is avadhi main bhi inhone vaigyanik or saahitiyik kaary baraabar kiye
 In 1907, Mendeleev died of pneumonia
 mendeleef kaa amar kaary tatwon aavart niyam or aavart sarini sambandhi he
 The physical and chemical properties of the elements are the periodic function of atomic weights - this rule was propounded around the same time by Lothar Mayer in Germany and Mendeleeff in Russia
 mendeleef ne tatwon kii jo aavart sarini prastut kii, usamen ab kaaphi sudhaar ho gaye hai, par yah sarini aaj tak rasayan vigyaan kaa path pradarshan kar rahi hai
 On the basis of this periodic table, Mendenliffe announced the existence of some elements that were not known in his time, and when these elements were discovered later, their properties were found to be those which had been predicted earlier
 mendeleef ke anya gaveshan kaary ye hai- aapekshik ghanatv dwaara vilyanon kaa adhyayan, alkohal or pani kaa sanyog, vilyan or saahchary, vilyanon ke sambandh main hydrate siddhant, charam taap kii kalpana kii
 Mendliffe wrote a book called 'chemistry Theory' in 1905, which was translated into all major languages

 Then comes a live moment
 or ye sabhi prakriya puri hone ke baad ant main sharir sadana shuru hota he
 During this process, the dead body of a human or animal begins to perish, or begins to rot
 vistaar se dekhen to sadan kaa matlab protein kaa vighatan hona, utakon ke bich saamanjasy kaa tootna tathaa angon kaa draveekaran ho janaa hota he
 It is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion

 Breakdown of the decomposed body proteins is a spontaneous process

 In fact, it is a relatively new building, when Motilal Nehru built this new building and made his old residence the local headquarters for Congress works, the old Anand Bhawan was renamed Swaraj Bhawan
 Started being told

 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Command at Mirganj
 When Nehruji was 10, Anand Bhawan was purchased and the whole family came here
 The old map of the city no longer left that house of Mirganj because it was destroyed in 1931 As part of the campaign, the municipality had toppled it
 In my story, Nehru ji wrote that 'hard work and persistence advocated that the result was that the cases started raging and earned a lot of money
' Motilal ji got more construction done in Anand Bhawan
 Anand Bhawan was made Swaraj Bhawan in 1930 and the Nehru family moved to the new building i
e
 Anand Bhawan
 Now Swaraj Bhawan became the declared office of Congress
 In the freedom movement 1942, the British government seized Swaraj Bhavan and that country became independent
 Only after it was liberated
 In 1948, the Congress headquarters moved from Allahabad to Delhi

 elahabaad ke faujadaar mohammad kuli khan kaa mamaa
 In the time of Mohammed Quli, Najaf Khan was the keeper of the fort of Allahabad
 najaf khan roj raat ke samay pichley pahar gupt maarg se aakar us angreji sena par dhaava karata jo udabaa naala ke durg ke baahar bengal ke nawab mir kasim ko pakadaney ke liye padi hui thi or anekon ko samaapt kar lut kaa maal lekar usee maarg se laut jaataa tha
 The British army could not follow him in any way
 ant main mir kasim kii sena ke ek angrej sainik ne vishwasghaat kiya
 He saw the secret passage of Najaf Khan very well
 4 sitambar 1763 i
 kii raat main vah angreji sena ko usee maarg se liva laayaa or mir kasim ke pandrah hajaar sainik kaam aae
 Now Mir Qasim thought of seeking help from Nawab shuja-ud-daula of Awadh, but Najaf refused him and drew his attention to the horrific consequences
 kintu mir kasim na mana or najaf use chhodkar bundelkhand ke sardaar hindoopati kii seva main chalaa gaya
 Shuja's eyes were on Bundelkhand and hence he pledged to help Mir Qasim after defeating Hindupati
 is par mir kasim ne kaary sheeghra samaapt karne ke liye swayan hindoopati par chadhaai kar di
 Najaf compromised diplomacy by intimidating Hindupati
 mir kasim vijayi hokar shuja ke paas elahabaad laut aayaa
 Seeing Najaf's successful diplomacy and military aptitude, the British called him from Bundelkhand and joined him before fighting Shuja
 najaf ko shuja se purana bair tha is kaaran usne angrejon ko sahaayta dena saharsha sweekaar kar liya
 From 1764 AD, he became a great assistant to the British
 shuja ke viruddh sahaayta dene ke badale main use shuja kii bhoomi kaa kuch bhaag athwa dhan dene kaa laalach diya gaya
 But Najaf was very clever
 vah angrejon se us samay mila jab ki baxur ke yuddh kaa parinaam unke paksh main nishchit ho gaya
 He helped a lot in winning the fort of Allahabad
 vah us kile kaa rakshak rah chukaa tha or uske rahasyon se parichit tha
 The British gave responsibility for the settlement of Awadh and Allahabad to Mirza Najaf Khan

 holkar kaa ahan dekh usne shuja ko angrejon se sandhi karne kii salaah di
 Shuja asked him to meet the British
 avasar paakar nazaf ne dhokhaa diya or 30 april 1765 i
 ko vah angrejon se ja mila
 When there was peace after the war, out of Bengal's 26 lakh annual tax, two lakh were paid annually to Najaf
 vah kadaa kaa faujadaar bhi niyukt kiya gaya kintu shashan prabandh main asafal hone par 21 farvari 1770 i
 ko use paduchyat kar diya gaya
 His mentor, the British asked Shah Alam to behave with kindness towards him
 shah alam dilli yatra main nazaf kii sevaaon se laabh uthaanaa chahta tha atev usne use kshamaa kar diya
 In 1771 AD he went to Delhi with Shah Alam
 vahaan usne kuch varshon tak mritpraaya: mughal shashan tabha vaibhav main phir ek baar jaan daali
 He drove the Jats out of Mathura
 11 disambar 1773 i
 ko usne agra nagar par or 18 farvari 1774 i
 ko agra ke kile par jaaton ko bhagaakar adhikaar kar liya
 Seeing his influence and military talent in Delhi, Nawab Wazir Shuja-ud-daulah considered forgetting the enmity and befriending him
 usne najaf ko bhent ke liye aamantrit kiya or use naayab vazeer manonith kiya
 Shuja also prepared him to assist against the Ruhels and by this he persuaded Shah Alam to lead the army
 ruhela yuddh ke pashchaat bulandshahr, mujffar nagar, meerut, agra, panipat, sonpat, haansi tathaa hisar main nazaf khan kaa prabhaav kshetra sweekaar kiya gaya jisase shuja kaa koi sambandh nahin tha
 Setting this limit, Shuja limited Najaf's ambition
 shuja ne use uttari bharat kaa atyant mahatvapurn vyakti sweekaar kiya or apni kanya kaa sambandh uske saath sthapit kar use apana damaad bhi bana liya
 He died in 1782 AD

 sangamagram ke madhav ek prasiddh kerala ganitagya-khagolgy the, ye bharat ke kerala rajya ke cochin jile ke nikat sthit ek kasbe irannalakkuta se the
 He is considered the founder of the Kerala Mathematics School
 ve pehle vyakti the, jinhone anek anant shreniyon vaale nikataagaman kaa vikaas kiya tha, jise "seemaa-parivartan ko anant tak le jane main pracheen ganit kii anant paddati se aage ek nirnaayak kadam" kaha jaataa he
 His discovery opened up avenues known today as mathematical analysis
 madhavan ne anant shreniyon, kalan, trikonmiti, jyamiti or bijganit ke adhyayan main agrani yogadan kiya
 He was one of the greatest mathematicians-astronomers of the medieval period
 kuch vidwaanon ne yah vichaar bhi diya he ki madhav ke kaary kerala skool ke madhyam se, jesut mishnariyon or vyapaariyon dwaara, jo us samay kochi ke pracheen pattan ke aasapaas kaaphi sakriy rahete the, europe tak bhi prasaarit hue hai
 As a result, it may also have had an impact on subsequent European development in analysis and calculus
 madhav kaa janm innarappili yaa innenavalli madhavan namboodiri ke rup main hua tha
 He wrote that his house name was related to a vihara, where he planted a plant named "bakulam"
 achyutha pishaarathi ke anusaar, bakulam sthaneey str par "iranni" ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Dr
 KV Sharma, who is the official of the works related to Madhavan, is of the opinion that his household name is Irinnarappilly or Irinnaravalli
 irinnalakkuta kisi samay irinnatikutal ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Sangamagramam is a slang translation of the Dravidian word Irinatikutal in Sanskrit, meaning the word 'iru Ananti Kutal' or unity of two markets
 haalanki madhav se purv bhi kerala main kuch ganit sambandhi kaaryon ke pramaan hai, ullekhon se yah spasht he ki madhyayugin kerala main madhav ne samrudh ganitiya parampara ke vikaas ke liye ek srujanaatmak aaveg pradaan kiya
 However, most of Madhava's original works have been lost
 unke uttarvarti ganitagyon ke kaaryon main unka ullekh kiya gaya he, visheshtah nilkanth somayaji ke tantrasangrah main anek sinθ or arctanθ vaali anant shreniyon ke prasar ke rup main
 solahavaan sadi ke lekh mahageanyan prakaar main madhav ko π ke anek shrenee vyutpadanon ke strot ke rup main kiya gaya he
 In Jyeshthadeva's Yiddha language written in the Malayalam language, these categories are presented with evidence as to the spread of the Taylor series for polynomials such as 1 / , where x = tan θ etc
 is prakaar, vastav main koun se kaary madhav dwaara kiye gaye hai, yah ek vivaad kaa vishay he
 yukti-deepika, possibly composed by Jyeshthadeva's disciple, Sankar Variyar, offers several formats of range propagation for sin θ, cos θ and arctan θ, as well as some product of radius and length of the segment, most of which Versions also appear in the lingua franca
 us shrenee, jiske bare main rajagopal or rangachari ne tark diya he, kaa vyapak rup se uddhran mul sanskrit bhashaa se nahin diya jaataa, or chunki iname se kuch shreniyon ke liye nilkanth ne madhav ko shrey diya he, isliye sambhawatah kuch anya praaroop bhi madhav ke kaaryon main se hi ho sakate hai
 Others have speculated that the early formulation of the Karnapaddhati, or Mahagyanayana type may have been written by Madhava, but it is unlikely
 karnapaddati, ke saath hi kerala kii or bhi pracheen ganit rachana sadaratnamala or tantrasangrah tathaa yuktibhaasha par, 1834 ke charles mathew whish ke ek lekh main vichaar kiya gaya he, yah fluction kii khoj main newton par praathamikta hetu unka dhyaan aakarshith karne vaala pehla lekh tha
 In the mid-twentieth century, Russian scholar Jushkevich reviewed Madhava's legacy work, and in 1972 Sarma provided a teacher inspection of the Kerala school
 kai aise gyaat khagolgy hai jo madhavan ke kaal se pehle aaye the, isamen kutalur kizhar bhi the, vararuki, sankaranryna 
 ho saktaa he ki anya agyaat vyakti bhi unke purvakaal main astitv main rahe hon
 haalanki, hamaare paas madhavan ke baad ke kaal kaa ek spasht lekha he
 Parmeshwar Namboodiri was his direct disciple
 surya siddhant kii ek malayalam tippanee kii taadptr hastlipi ke anusaar, nilkanth somyaji parameswar ke putr damodar ke shishy the
 Jyeshthadeva was a disciple of Neelkanth
 achyut pishaarathi jo ki trikkaantiyur ke the, unka ullekh bhi jyeshthadev ke shishy ke rup main he orgrammemarian melpthur narayana bhattathiri achyut ke shishy the
 If we consider mathematics as a series from finite processes of algebra to infinite processes, then the first step towards this transformation would ideally begin with the process of infinite series 
 This is the change towards the infinite series, for which Madhava is credited
 europe main,aisi pehali shrenee kaa vikaas 1667 main james gregory ne kiya tha
 Madhava's work in relation to the category is remarkable, but what is really extraordinary is the evaluation of the error term he made
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki anant shrenee kii seemaa sambandhi prakruti ko unhone bahut bhalee prakaar samajha tha
 Hence, Madhava may have invented the underlying ideas of infinite series propagation, power series, trigonometric series and rational approximation of infinite series
 haalanki, jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, vishuddh rup se madhav dwaara die gaye parinaam or unke parvartiyon dwaara die gaye parinaamon kaa nirdhaaran kar paanaa kuch kathin he
 Below is a summary of the results for which Madhava has been credited by various scholars
 unke anek yogadanon ke antargat, unhone sine, cosine, tangent or arctangent trikoshmitiya falnon ke liye anant shrenee kii khoj kii or ek vrutt kii paridhi kii gananaa ke liye bhi kai tareeke nikaale
 yuktibhaasha pustak se gyaat madhav kii ek shrenee he, jo sparshajya ke vyutkram kii ghaat shrenee kaa pramaan or vupadan sammilit karti he, isaki khoj madhav dwaara hi kii gayi thi
 In the book, Jyesthadeva explains this category in this way
 isse praapt hoga r θ = r sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ θ − r 3 3 + r 5 5 − r 7 7 + 
 
 
 { \ displaystyle r \ theta ={ \ frac {r \ sin \ theta }{ \ cos \ theta }}- \ ,r \ ,{ \ frac { \ left^{3}}{ \ left^{3}}}+ \ ,r \ ,{ \ frac { \ left^{5}}{ \ left^{5}}}- \ ,r \ ,{ \ frac { \ left^{7}}{ \ left^{7}}}+


} Which later gives such a result: yah shrenee paramparaagat rup se gregory shrenee ke naam se jaani jaati thi
 Even if we consider this category to be the discovery of Jyeshthadeva, it would be a century before Gregory's time and certainly other infinite categories of this type have been discovered by Madhava
 aaj, ise madhav-gregory-lebinise shrenee ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Madhava also gave the most suitable table for the sines, defined as the values of half-sine creatures drawn at equal intervals on the quadrant of a given circle
 aisa mana jaataa he ki unhone yah atyant sateek saarini nimna shrenee prasaron ke aadhaar par praapt kii hogi: In the following verses Madhava has given the relation of the circumference of the circle and its diameter which is expressed through the past number in this verse - iskaa arth he- 9 x 1011 vyas vaale vrutt kii paridhi 2872433388233hogi
 In relation to the value of π, we find mention of Madhava's work in the Mahagyanayana prakara where some scholars like Sarma, believe that this book may have been written by Madhava himself, on the other hand it was written by 16th century successors
 The chances are high
 yah pustak anek prasaron ke liye madhav ko hi shrey detii he or π ke liye nimna anant shrenee prasar detii he, jise ab madhav-lebinise shrenee ke naam se janaa jaataa he: Which he derived from the power series expansions of the arc-tangent function
 haalanki, sabase adhik prabhavit karne vaali baat yah he ki unhone ek sanshodhan pad, Rn bhi diya, jo n padon tak gananaa ke baad aane vaali truti ke liye tha
 Madhava had given three forms of Rn which modified the approximation, it named jahaan tisare sanshodhan ke falswaroop π kaa atyant parishuddh pariklan miltaa he
 How to reach this type of amendment post
 sabase vishwasaneey tathy yah he ki ye satat bhinn ke pratham teen abhisaron ke rup main aate hai jise swayan hi π ke maanak nikat maan se vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he, yah 62832 / 2 xxrep 4 0 he 
 He gave an even more quickly convergent series by converting the original infinite series of π to the infinite series
 π ke nikatatam maan ke pariklan ke liye pehle 21 padon ke prayog dwaara, unhone ek aisa maan praapt kiya jo dashamalav ke 11 sthanon tak sahi tha 
3
1415926535898 kaa maandashmalav ke 13 sthanon tak sahi, ke liye bhi kabhi-kabhi madhav ko shrey diya jaataa he
 But this is probably given by one of his disciples
 yah paanchavi shatabdi se π ke sabase parishuddh nikatatam maanon main se tha 
 The book Sadratnamala, generally considered to be a pre-madhav book, also surprisingly gives an extremely accurate value of π, π = 3
14159265358979324
 On this basis, R
K
 Gupta has argued that this book may also have been written by Madhav itself
 madhav ne vruttkhand kii lambaai kii anya shreniyon or isse sambandhit π kii parimey bhinn sankhyaon ke nikatatam maan par bhi anusandhan kiya, unhone bahupad prasar ke tareeke khoje, anant shrenee ke liye abhisarita pareekshan khoja or anant satat bhinn sankhyaon kaa vishleshan kiya
 He also found the solution of esoteric equations by iteration and obtained the approximate values of esoteric numbers by continuous fractions
 madhav ne kalan ke vikaas kii neenv rakhi, jise unke parvartiyon ne kerala skool of estronaumi and mathematics main aage viksit kiya
 Madhava also carried forward some of the results obtained from ancient works, including the works of Bhaskara II
 kalan main, unhone avkalan, samakalan ke praarambhik praaroop kaa prayog kiya he or unhone yaa unke shishyon ne saadhaaran phalno ke samakalan kaa vikaas kiya
 K
V
 Sharma has described Madhav as the author of the following books: madhavan ke baad keraly ganit sampradaay kam se kam do shatabdiyon tak faltaa-phulataa rahaa
 From Jyeshthadeva we got the idea of integration, which was called Sankalam, as in this statement: jo samakalan ko ek aise char ke rup main anuvaadit karata he jo char ke varg ke aadhe ke baraabar hoga; arthath x dx kaa samakalandad2 / 2 ke baraabar hoga
 This is clearly the beginning of integration
 isse sambandhit ek anya parinaam kahata he ki kisi vakr ke andar kaa kshetrafal uske samakal ke baraabar hota he
 Most of these results date back several centuries before similar results existed in Europe
 anek prakaar se, jyeshthadev kii yuktibhaasha kalan par vishwa kii pehali pustak maani ja sakati he
 Madhava has been called "the greatest mathematician-astronomer of the Middle Ages", or "the founder of mathematical analysis"; some of his research in this area reveals that he had an extraordinary intuition talent

 In the 16th century, the Jesuits, who were familiar with the reputation of Madhavan and his disciples, found it almost impossible to study Sanskrit and Malayalam and pass it on to European mathematicians, instead of making this discovery on their own

 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth

 Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in some of the best schools and universities in the world
 unhone apni schuli shiksha hero se or college kii shiksha trinity college, cambridge se puri kii thi
 He then completed his law degree from Cambridge University
 england main unhone saat saal vyateet kiye jisamen vahaan ke fabian samaajwaad or irish rashtrawaad ke liye ek tarksangat drushtikon viksit kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model

 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer

 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both

 The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc
 in the United States and Canada and Mattel elsewhere
 Variations of the game include Literati, Alphabet, Funwarder, skip-a-cross, Scramble, Spellophone, square-right, Palabras Cruzadas, Word for Word, Lexalus and Verdipelago
 While all of these games are similar to the original Scrabble games, they include minor changes
 udhaaharan ke taur par, litreti main khel ke liye ek parimit sankhya main tilein uplabdh karaane ke bajaae yadrichhik tilein rakhi jaati hai, prayek akshar ke liye vibhinn ank str pradaan kiye jate hai or iske board abhinyas main bhi thodaa sa antar hota he jabaki lexlas prayek khaladi ko prathagat 7 ke bajaae 8 akshar pradaan karata he

 In 1938, architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game which was a modified version of the earlier word game he invented called Lexico

 unhone kuch jode khud hi nirmit kiye, lekin ve is khel ko us samay ke kisi pramukh khel nirmaataa ko bech paane main asafal rahe
 In 1948, James Brunot, a resident of Newtown Connecticut - and one of the owners of the original Chris Crossword game - purchased the rights to produce the game, instead agreeing to pay royalties to Butts for each game unit sold
 Although they left much of the game unchanged, Brunot slightly rearranged the "rise" of the board's square mines and simplified the rules of the game slightly; He also changed the name of the game to Scrabble, which actually means "scratching like crazy
" In 1949, Brunot and his family began building these sets in a formerly converted schoolhouse in Dozingtown, a section of Newtown
 unhone us varsh 2400 set taiyaar kiye, parantu isamen unhen nuksaan hua
 According to legend, Scrabble gained a major recognition in 1952 when Jack Strouse, president of the Mackies, played it during the holidays
 chuttee se lautne par, unhen is baat kii hairaani hui ki unki dukaan main vah khel nahin he
 He gave a huge command and within a year, "everyone has one
" In 1952, in the event of not meeting this demand, Brunot sold his manufacturing rights to Long Island-based Selcho & Writer and Like the makers of the Milton Bradley Company previously rejected the game)

 The game is played by two or four players on a square board made up of 15-by-15 grids, each of which places a single letter tile within it
 aadhikarik klbon or toornament khelon main, yah khel hameshaa do khiladiyon ke bich hi khelaa jaataa he 
 The game consists of 100 tiles, 98 of which have a letter and a numeric value between 1 and 10
 prayek tile par ankit ankon kii sankhya us tile par ankit akshar kii maanak angreji lekhan main aavriti par aadhaarit hoti he, aamtaur par upyog kiye jane vaale akshar jaise e yaa o par ek ank hota he, jabaki kam upyog kiye jane vaale akshar adhik ank liye hue hote hai, jaise q or z par 10 ank hote hai
 The game also has two blank tiles which are unmarked and have no value of points
 ek baar board par rakhe jane par, in rikt tilon ko kisi bhi akshar ke liye sthanapann ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki, inkaa chunaav pehle se tay hota he
 The board is marked by a large "premium", which increases the number of digits earned: eg dark red "triple word" square, pink "double word" square, dark blue "triple letter" square, and light blue "double-letter" class
 The square in the middle of the board is often marked by a star or logo and counts as a double word square
 toornament khelon main aam taur par istemaal kii jane vaali sanketan pranali main, stambhon ko "A se O" tak chihnit kiya jaataa he or panktiyon ko "1 se 15" tak
yah khel aam taur par xy verde score yaa verde xy score ke praaroop main pahachaanaa jaataa he, jahaan x un stambhon yaa panktion ko nirdisht karata he jis par khel kaa mukhya shabd banataa he, y mukhya shabd ke pehle akshar ke duusare samanvay ko nirdisht karata he or WORD hi mukhya shabd hota he
 While this is unnecessary, additional words formed during the game are periodically listed after the key word and a slash
 aise maamle main jahaan ek ekal tile ko rakhane par prayek disha main shabdon kaa gathan ho rahaa ho, un shabdon main se kisi ek shabd ko manamaane dhang se mukhya shabd ke rup main ankan ke liye chunaa jaataa he
 When a blank tile is used in a key word, the letter it is meant to represent is specified by lowercase letters, or, handwritten notation, in which a square is formed around the letter
 
 kabhi-kabhi ek rikt sthaan ko namoddisht karne ke liye ek koshthak kaa bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he, haalanki yah koshthak ke ek anya kaary ke saath bhram paidaa kar saktaa he, arthath kisi bhi maujuuda akshar yaa shabd jo mukhya shabd ke "madhyam se khelaa" gaya he, use namoddisht karne ke liye
 Example 1: adition D3 74 Before the game, the letter tiles are either placed in an opaque bag or upside down on a flat spot
 apaardarshee kapade ke bag or anukulit tilein club or toornamenton main pradhan hoti hai, jahaan khel ko shaayad hi kabhi in donon ke bina khelaa jaataa he
 Next, the players decide in which order they will play
 The common method adopted for this is that players have to remove tiles and the player who picks the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet starts
 uttar america toornament main, america sthit north american scrable players association ke niyam ke anusaar jo khilaadi toornament main nunatam khelon main pratham hue hai unke paas variyata he, yaa asafal hone par, jo log duusare sthaan par the unke paas variyata hoti he
 In the case of a tie, tiles are designed to conform to standard rules
 khel kii shuruyaat main or prayek baari ke baad main, jab tak bag khaali naa ho jaae, khilaadi apane "rack" yaa tile dharakon ko saat tiles se bharne ke liye tiles nikaalte hai, jisase ve khel shuru karte hai
 Each rack is hidden from the other players
 baari ke dauraan, ek khilaadi ke paas apane rack main saat yaa usase kam akshar ke tile hote hai jisase vah ek khel kaa chayan karata he
 At every turn, a player has the option: pass, lose turn and earn zero points, swapping one or more tiles for the same number of bags, earning zero points, an option that is only available when Have at least seven tiles in the bag, or create a game on the board, adding its value to the player's cumulative score
 ek uchit khel main board par ek satat shabd banane ke liye khilaadi kii tiles kaa kisi bhi sankhya main upyog ho saktaa he, jise yaa to baayen se daaen yaa upar se neeche padhaa ja saktaa he
 The key word must be either using letters from pre-used words, or it must have at least one tile connected horizontally or vertically to a previously played word
 yadi mukhya shabd se itar shabdon ko khel main pehali baar banaaya gaya he to unhen arjeet bhi kiya jaataa he or ve sweekaaryata ke liye usee samaan maapdand ke adheen hote hai
 When the board is empty, the first word played must invoke H8, which is the central square
 shabd ko kshaitij yaa anulamb rup se vistaar karte hue kam se kam do aksharon se milakar bana hona chahie
 H8 is a premium class, so the first player to play a word gets a double digit
 ek rikt tile kisi bhi akshar kii jagah le saktaa he
 That tile remains as the letter for the rest of the game
 vyaktigat rup se, yah koi ank arjeet nahin karata, is baat kii parvaah kiye bina ki us par kya akshar likhaa he or vah khud premium tiles se prabhavit nahin hota
 However, a suitable premium is earned by its placement on a double-word or triple-word class, for the word in which it is used
 kisi aadhikarik yaa toornament khel kaa hissaa naa hote hue, ek aam "grih niyam" khilaadiyon ko rikt tile kii "punrariti" karne kii anumati dete hai jiske liye ve sambandhit akshar tiles ko baad main pratisthapit karte hai
 After playing a word, players remove letter tiles from the bag to fill their racks to seven tiles
 agar aisa karne ke liye bag main paryaapt tiles nahin hai, to khilaadi shesh sabhi tiles ko le letaa he
 After a player plays a word, their opponent can challenge any word or all of the words made by the game
 agar chunauti die gaye shabdon main se kisi ek ko asweekaarya paaya jaataa he, to khel ko board se hataa diya jaataa he, to khilaadi, nae khele gaye tile ko apane rack main waapas kar lete hai or unki baari jabt ho jaati he
 In tournament play, the challenge occurs throughout the game rather than in a single word, so a decider is used and players are unable to know which word or words caused the challenge to win
 ek sweekaarya khel ke liye asafal chunauti khadi karne kaa dand, club or toornament khelon main bhinn he or unki charchaa neeche vistaar se kii gai he
 By the rules of North America, the game ends when a player has finished playing all the tiles in his rack and all the tiles in his bag have been emptied; When six consecutive scoreless moves are played and both scores are not zero
 jab khel samaapt hota he, prayek khilaadi ke score se uske bina khele hue aksharon ke ankon ke jod ko gata diya jaataa tha
 In addition, if a player has used all of his letters, the digits of the letters played without the other player are also added to their digits; In tournament games, a player who "goes out" adds double the sum and no penalty is imposed on the opponent
 score rahit chaal tab maani jaati he jab ek avaidh shabd ko board ke baahar chunauti di jaati he, jab ek khilaadi apni chaal ko paas kar detaa he, jab ek khilaadi tilon kii adla-badali karata he, yaa jab ek shabd keval rikt tilon se bana hua hota he, yah antim niyam antarrashtriya khel main thodaa bhinn hota he
 The scores of each word formed in the game are earned in this way: yadi ek khilaadi ek hi khel main rack par rakhe saaton tilon kaa upyog karata he, to 50 ankon kaa ek bonus uske khel main jod diya jaataa he 
 These bonus points are not affected by the premium class
 jab shabd taiyaar karne ke liye akshar khatm ho jate hai, tab antim khel praayah vijeta kaa nirdhaaran kar saktaa he
 This is particularly seen in cases of thorn collisions between more than two players
 jo khilaadi sabase pehle khel se baahar ho jaataa he uske bina khele hue tilon ke ankon ke yoga ko baaki khilaadiyon ke score main jod diya jaataa he
 Players who have remaining tiles on the rack have the sum of their remaining tiles subtracted from their score
 kuch chuninda shabdkoshon main praathmik pravishtiyon or unke sanyugmi roopon ko, sweekaarya shabd mana jaataa he
 Words with hyphens, uppercase, or apostrophy are not allowed to be used, unless they are also visible as acceptable entries: "jack" is a proper noun, but the word Jack is also acceptable because its There are also many other uses that are acceptable
 laghu rup yaa sankshepakshar, niyamit kar die gaye shabdon ke alawa, ke upyog kii anumati nahin he
 Different spelling, abusive or offensive words, outdated or obsolete words, and words of specific vocabulary are permitted only if they meet all other criteria of acceptance

 The initial printing of OWL2 and OSPD4 was to be modified according to the post corrigenda on the National Scrabble Society's Web site
 uttar america pratiyogitaaon main lambey shabdon ke liye Long Words List kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 OWL2 and OSPD4 were compiled using four major college-level dictionaries, including merriam-webster

 The main difference between OWL2 and OSPD4 is that OSPD4 is marketed for use in "home and school" and removes many words that were offensive according to the source dictionaries and the official Scrabble Player Dictionary of playing Scrabble
 Rendered to be less suitable for
 OSPD4 pustak bhandaron main uplabdh he, jabaki OWL2 keval rashtriya scrable sanstha ke khudara website wordgear

 Penalties for an unsuccessful challenge vary greatly, including: uttar america "box niyam" ko teen baar sampadit kiya gaya: 1953 main, 1976 main or 1989 main
 The major changes made in 1953 were as follows: 1976 ke pramukh badlaav is prakaar hai: Editorial changes made in 1989 did not affect the game

 The intensity of the game, ignorance of words and high scores in tournament games can appear as a shock to many parlor players
 sabhi toornament khel, ek khel ghadi or nashchit samay niyantran ke saath khelaa jaataa he
 Almost all tournament games involve only 2 players; Typically, each player has 25 minutes to run all his or her claims
 samay niyantran ke prayek minute ko paar karne par ek khilaadi ko 10 ank kaa jurmaana bharna padataa he
 The number of minutes is represented in full, so that if a player crosses the time control by two minutes and five seconds the penalty is 30 points

 Players are allowed to have "tracking sheets," which are already printed with the starting pool, and from which the played tiles are cut

 pramukh kaushal yah jaanane main he ki koun se shabd sweekaarya yaa asweekaarya hai or shabdon ko avyavasthit aksharon ke dher main se khojane main sakasham hone main he
 Nearly all important tournament players study word lists extensively and practice solving words with alphagrams or irregular disorganized letters
 keval kuch hi khilaadiyon ko antarrashtriya khel ke liye sabhi sweekaarya shabdon kaa pataa hota he
 But it is almost certain that the key players do not know all the words but almost fully know the words which are likely to be in their life
 udhaaharan ke liye, ZYZZYVA jaise shabd kii jaankaree hone main koi vyaavhaarik laabh nahin he, kyonki isamen ek atyant asambhavit rack kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jisamen donon Y, donon rikt, do v main se ek or keval z 
 Conversely, learning words such as ATRESIA and finding them reliably have a significant value, using a group of very common letters
 ek shuruaati club khilaadi ke liye, kanthsth karne ke liye sabase mahatvapurn suchi he 101 yaa 124 sweekaarya do akshar ke shabd kyonki yah unhen maujuuda shabd ke samanaantar shabd se khilne kii anumati dete hai or aage badhane yaa ek shabd ko paar karne kii tulana main aksar adhik ank arjeet karne kaa mauka dete hai
 More serious players can take this a step further and try to remember the 1015 or 1292 accepted three-letter word
 do aksharon ke shabdon main praveen hone ke baad shuruuaati khilaadiyon ko chote shabdon ke adhyayan se kaaphi laabh hota he kyonki isamen ucch score ke tiles shaamil hote hai, iske saath-saath hook suchi kaa bhi adhyayan karte hai jo shabd ke aage or peeche koun se akshar ko joda jaae, ko darshaate hai or isliye yah ek baari main kai shabdon ke gathan ke liye aavashyak he
 March 2006 and until the release of OWL2 which included QI as an accepted word for the first time and created an important strategy for recalling words], in some cases they have no u without them
 There is a q on the rack
 q ke shaamil ne U-ke bina q ko kam mahatvapurn bana diya he, kyonki aisa sambhaavna he ki ek khilaadi ke paas bina khelaa hua ek q hoga mahatvapurn rup se ghat jayega
 shuruuaati khilaadiyon ke liye s or rikt sthaan kaa ranneeti purvak istemaal ek anya mahatvapurn tip he, jo hook or sabhi tile bonus ke liye adhik upyogi he 
 In the above fixed level of the game, there is a good rule of thumb that holding an s means 8 to 10 points and a blank space above 25 points
 english ke kisi saamaanya angreji swaron - AEIOU or kabhi-kabhi y kii tulana main welsh ke ek w swar ke saath Cwm shabd ek teen akshar ke shabd ke liye kaaphi prasiddh he
 Experienced players often choose less than the maximum scoring game in an individual turn in favor of good rack management practice
 aise akshar jinka mulya chaar yaa adhik ank hota he aise aksharon ko ho sake to premium varg par khelaa janaa chahie or X, h or y jaise akshar tab kaaphi shaktishaalee hote hai jab inhen donon dishaao main arjeet kiya ja sake, jo unke ankit mulya se chaar yaa chah baar adhik hoga
 a vowel followed by a double - or triple letter score creates a hot spot where an important consonant can be played forcefully for several digits
 ausat khilaadiyon ke liye ek acchhee ranneeti yah hoti he ki ve un sabhi shabdon ko yaad kar le jinamein "power" tilein hoti hai jaise, jo paanch akshar lambey yaa chote hote hai
 Knowledge of these words can increase a player's scoring by 10 to 20 points per game if they are used properly
 rack prabandhan ek aisi ranneeti tatv he jise aam taur par adhikansh shuruuaati khiladiyon dwaara andekha kiya jaataa he
 It is counterproductive to keep copies of most letters or to have a large imbalance between the number of vowels and consonant tiles
 udhaaharan ke liye, AADIIKR aksharon se banane vaala sarvaadhik score vaala shabd DARK he
 However, after this, the player has no consonants and a double
 kyonki scrable main swaron kaa istemaal saamanytah adhik hota he, yah puri tarah se sambhav he ki khilaadi apane aage kii baari main AAIIEUAO aksharon ko le kar pravesh kar jaae, udhaaharan ke liye
 If the player had selected RADII - letters to play then he would have scored lower than the word DARK - and the player would only have a and k letters that had a common combination
 jo visheshgy khilaadi sabhi chaar akshar vaale shabdon ko jaanate hai unhone avashya hi KADI yaa RAKI ko achche prabhaav ke liye khelaa hoga or ek r yaa ek d ko chhodkar
 Defense is an important part of the strategy
 virdohi khilaadi kaise apane tiles se laabh uthaate hai is baat par anbhavi khilaadi kaaphi nazar rakhte he or aasaan chaal lene se bachate hai
 For example, the word QUIT, created by a player, gives a 14-digit increment to any opponent who has the letter E
 ek anbhavi khilaadi kisi bonus varg ke bagal main ek swar ke bajaae ek vyanjan lagayegaa
 anbhavi khilaadi akshar u ko ek asuvidhajanak sthaan par rakhane kaa prayaas karenge yadi akshar q ko us samay tak khelaa naa gaya ho
 Many players manage their racks to earn as much bingo as possible due to a 50 point bonus for using all seven tiles in one turn
 aamtaur par teji se ucch ank praapt karne ke liye saat yaa aath akshar ke shabd bananaa banane ke saat or aath patr shabdon aam taur par teji se ek ucch ank praapt karne ke liye tarika he
 The letters A, E, I, N, R, s and t are the most useful characters for this purpose and so a good player would be reluctant to play off these letters without some benefit in return
 iske vipareet, achche khilaadi ke liye ravaanaa avaanchhneeya tiles khilne kaa prayaas karte hai, samay par hoga to bhi he ki khel ek scoring ucchtam uplabdh nahin he or vinimay tiles ke liye ek baari kaa upyog karegaa yadi aavashyak ho
 "LIRI MUMU and vowel apathy" are more useful in ridding the tone than one of the racks is
 vahaan INIA, jaise shabdon ke kuch kar rahe hai, jo swar or adhik shaamil ke 75% yaa
 yah he you vishesh or mahatvapurn karne ke liye chhutkaaraa paane ke atirikt main, suchi shabd kyonki main uttari america ke vahaan shaamil nahin kar rahe hai teen patr shabdon jisame kai main, keval or ek teen akshar kaa shabd he jo ekaadhik you 
 Using the international word list, there are options for players, Collins and more to play through the rack with many unwanted vocals
 madhyavarti str ke khilaadiyon ke liye ek acha tarika karne ke liye "bingo yaad upji he," yaa chah patr he ki lagbhag kisi bhi saatven patr ke saath acchhee tarah se gathbandhan karne ke liye ek bingo farm kaa samooh he
 The best is to stem bingo is followed by confirmatory vigilante, retina and satire
 jammu pushtikar joshanda rack par ke saath yaa vaai ; karenge yaa banane ke ek saat aksharon kaa shabd in saat akshar kaa shabdon ke kai se aspasht hai, to yah upyogi he na keval stem yaad he, lekin sabhi sambhav bingos ki iske saath banaaya ja saktaa he
 Players may also learn the seven letter bingo stems, which can combine with an eighth letter already on the board
 aadesh main khilne ke dauraan memorization or gati ke liye donon ko is prakriya main, kuch khilaadiyon ke smarak kaa upyog karne ke liye, neeche se link dekh samet ek vishisht prakaar janaa jaataa he
 Another strategy that players use to increase bingos is to put together three to four letter combinations that form multiple bingos
 in sanyojanon kii aam udhaaharan "shaamil IED ienji," "ERS", "IES" or "
" ek madhyavarti khilaadi ke liye "" ienji karne ke liye ek baad main bingo khilne par vartmaan ank kii keemat par banane ke liye par pakad kii sambhaavna he
 "ing especially" bingos tend to be easier for players to find because they have tried to find a game to rearrange seven instead of only four characters
 visheshgy khilaadi, ucchtam str par do bingo se upar khelte hai or ek hi khel main ek khilaadi dwaara chaar bingo bhi asaamaanya nahin he
 As has been said, a bingo at the tournament level gives a player a bonus of 50 points, so given that a bingo gives a 50 point bonus, the number of bingo at the competition level is often a determining factor in the game
 pratispardhi scrable main shabdon ke liye sweekaarya hai - saath ke saath ke gyaan ke ucchtam str par apni "- dur tak hook" sabase mahatvapurn kaarak he
 Scrabble experts tend to play games that use the premium class to provide ample opportunities for their opponents, unlike intermediate players who become more concerned about stopping their opponents
 shabd gyaan bad jaati he ke rup main rakshaatmak ranneeti kii ichha kii jarurat he
 As in many games, when a player is behind he or she must gamble and try to make the difference to taking more risks, losing 20 points is the same as losing 40
 ulataa bhi sahi he, khilaadiyon ko jo aage hai or raksha khelnaa chahie
 It has been proven as a study to have a good idea to "scribble tiles" for themselves while playable for a time search, words that players who do not use physically manipulate tiles which are more possible than those words Generate your hands

 ) According to mythology, there was a king named Sudhanwa in ancient times
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi ek baar parashar muni ko uski naav par baith kar yamuna paar karnaa padaa
 Parashar Muni Satyavati became enamored of beauty and said, "devi! i want to cum with you
 " satyavati ne kaha, "muniver! aap brahmagyani hai or main nishad kanya
 We do not have sex
 " tab parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " itnaa kah kar unhone apane yogabal se chaaron ore ghaney kuhare kaa jaal rach diya or satyavati ke saath bhoga kiya
 After that, while blessing him, he said, the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrant
 " When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas

 Vyasji was called Krishna Dwaipayana because his color was black
 ve paidaa hote hi maan kii ajna se tapasya karne chale gayi the or kah gayi the ki jab bhi tum samaran karogi, main aa jaaoongaa
