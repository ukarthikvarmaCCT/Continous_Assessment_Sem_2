 One criterion of cognitive psychology derived in this way is that each person develops a schematic that motivates them to think or act in specific situations or to cope with them

 Seeing these countries as a 'special case' in the world economy, it is often believed that their problems are broadly the same
 shuru main in deshon ke prati vyakti jidipi ke nichle str ko unke alpavikas kaa paryaay mana gaya
 It was later realized that much of the agricultural produce is spent by farmers rather than going to the market, so the methods of measuring GDP are not able to estimate national income correctly
 parinamswaroop in deshon kii aamadani ke sahi akalan ke liye poorak anumaan lagane kii vidhi apanaayi gayi
 Most of the victims of underdevelopment are found in Asia and Africa

 However, this economics has also given rise to a considerable debate on the question of the interference of the institution of the state in the economy

 For example, Arthur Lewis has shed light on the dual structure in the economies of poor countries

 prebeesh ne garib deshon kii avasthaa main chautarfa giravat rokane ke liye dirghakaalin rinon kii aavashyaktaa par bhi bal diya he
 rozenstein-rodan suggested that poor countries should try to benefit from the progressively increasing income from industrialization
 mint ne antarrashtriya vaanijya ke saath aarthik vikaas ko joda he or singer ne santulit vruddhi kaa suzav diya he
 Amartya Sen has given the idea of achieving equality of abilities
 ve aamadani yaa sansadhano kii samta ke bajaay logon kii kshamtaaon ko baraabar karne par jor dete he
 According to Amartya Sen, if social policy is made in such a way that people can develop different workable abilities, then the ideal of equality can be achieved
 masalan, agar kisi kshetra main nirakshartaa he, to sansadhano kii samta main yakeen karne waalon ke liye yah paryaapt hoga ki rajya or samaaj uplabdh sansaadhan kitabon or shiksha sambandhi sevaaon par karch karen
 However, advocates of parity of abilities would like measures to be taken to create an internal competency called education within the people
 amartya sen chaahate hai ki vishmata kaa vishleshan karte samay maanviya vividhta kaa puri baariki se dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 This diversity is internal as well as external
 masalan, vaise to har stri gender sambandhi bhedbhaav kii shikaar hoti he, par dalit stri or unchi jati kii stri kii paristhitiyaan ekadam alag-alag ho sakati hai
 Similarly, care should be taken between the living conditions of a Dalit woman in New Delhi and a upper caste widow in Rajasthan or Haryana
 saamaajik nitiyaan agar in antaron kaa khyaal karke banaayi jaayengi to kshamtaaon kii samta adhik behatar dhang se praapt kii ja sakegi
 Inspired by the theory of imperialism promoted by Karl Marx, the theory of dependence has been formulated by Andre Gunder Frank
 is sthapana ne vaikasik arthshaastra main amul parivartan laa diya he
 Frank believes that capitalism on the world scale is based on the exploitation of third world countries by developed countries
 praudyogiki or bazaar par niyantran ke madhyam se vishwa arthvyastha ke centre main baithe hue ye desh haashiye par pade hue garib deshon se atirikt mulya khinch rahe hai
 Another debate related to developmental economics is also about the extent and goal of development
 trutipurna akalan or durandeshi ke abhaav kii shikaar vikaas nitiyon ke kaaran paryaavaran or paristhitiki ko hui kshati ko dhyaan main rakhte hue 1987 main brandland report ke zariye tikaoo vikaas kii avadharana pesh kii gayi he taaki maujuuda aavashyaktaaon kaa bhavishya kii zaruuraton ke saath talmail baithaaya ja sake

 Rashtriya Rifles or "RR" is a branch of the Indian Army under the jurisdiction of the Indian Ministry of Defense
 yah ek aatankwaad virdohi / rajdroh virdohi bal he jo rashtriya rifles main sevarat bhartiya sena ke anya bhaagon se pratiniyukt sainikon se bana he
 Half of the rrs come from the infantry of the Indian Army, and the remaining half from the rest of the Indian Army
 yah bal jammu-kashmir main tainaat kiya gaya he
 The emblem of the Rashtriya Rifles consists of an Ashoka Chakra, a crossed hat with two hats and the motto of this force is printed in a banner below - Perseverance and Valor
 yah bal kashmir main ugravad se ladane ke liye or kshetra main kamjor sthaneey suraksha balon ko behtareen banane ke liye samarpit, 1990 main general es epa rodrigs dwaara uthaae gaye or general bi si joshi dwaara dhaala gaya tha
 By 1994 it had 5,000 soldiers, all of whom served in Jammu and Kashmir
 kuch paryvekshakon ne isamen tees bataliyanon tak viksit hone or kareeb 25,000 karmiyon ke hone kii ummid jataai thi
 In March 1995, Indian television reported about the Delta Force of the "new" National Rifles
 yah bataaya gaya ki yah bal dakshin-madhya jammu-kashmir main aatankwaadiyon or doda jile main videshi aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaa rahaa tha
 Early RR units performed well despite some weaknesses inherent in their class and structure
 ve akhil bhartiya sena bhar se sainikon ke saath sabhi virgon ke aadhaar par uthaae gaye the
 It was argued that when these units go to fight a rebellion there should be no scope for accusations of favoritism based on class or regional characteristics
 durbhaagya se, is kadam se is kshetra main samasyaayen paidaa hone lageen
 In the initial RR units, soldiers kept coming and going at regular intervals, there was no harmony between them
 prashasan kii kai samasyaayein or anushaasanheenata bhi dekhi gayi thi
 cos of infantry battalions who were said to provide manpower used this as an opportunity to get rid of troublemakers
 agar batalian pratikul paristhitiyon main acha pradarshan karti bhi thi to, yah mukhya rup se adhikariyon ke netritv va unki peshewar kshamta kii vajah se hi tha
 Keeping this in mind, the decision was taken to change the basic structure of the RR Battalion
 apni ikaiyaan jo sabhi sena bhar ke sainikon se baniin thim ,kii jagah, do aaraar batalian paidal sena regiment bana deen gayin jo ek duusare kaa abhinn hissaa banaayin gayi ek regiment kii mukhya tukdi thi va baaki sabhi regiment se mila kar banaaya jaataa tha
 Now not only two RR regiments, but also their commanding officer or 2IC used to be from the same regiment

 It is basically two cats
 Razor and t Ban who protect the imaginary city called Mahabilla in which only Vidal Vanshi lives from every danger
 They run the garage in the day and come at the chance of danger
 Days come and protect the city, which is always reported by Deputy Mayor Cali
 Always use airplanes anda gol yaa andakar jivit vastu he jo bahut se praaniyon ke maadaa dwaara paidaa kii jaati he
 Most animal eggs have a hard cover that protects the eggs
 yadhyapi anda jeevadhariyon dwaara apni santane paidaa karne kaa maarg he, kintu anda khaane ke kaam bhi aata he
 Protein and choline are rich in it in terms of nutrients
 prayek jati kii chidiyon ke andon main, thodi bahut bhinnata bhale hi ho, par inaki apni ek visheshta hoti he
 The size, shape and color of the eggs of birds of each race is unique
 pakshiyon ke jivan or unke angon ke aakaar, maap, sataha kii rachana or rang main ek sambandh he
 Similarly, there is a relation between the number of eggs within a bulk or group and the number of clots in a season
 andey kii maap mukhyat: anda denevaali chidiya ke dealdol par nirbhar karti he, kintu yah aavashyak nahin he ki anupaat hameshaa ek ho
 There are two reasons for this : murgi ke andey kaa jo aakaar hota he, vahi aakaar praaia: anya chidiyon ke andon kaa hota he
 The egg is long in one direction and has one end rounded and the other end slightly pointed
 andey ek chor par gol or duusare chor par nukile hone se saralata se ludhak nahin pate
 Also, with the pointed portion of the eggs being centered in the middle of the nest and their spherical portion facing out, if the nest contains three to four eggs, they all easily hatch
 kuch chidiyon ke andey lagbhag golakaar hote hai
 Owl eggs are spherical and bacassi eggs are thin and round at both ends
 kuch chidiyon ke andon kii satahen chikani hoti hai, kuch kii chamakili, kuch kii bahut adhik paalishdaar or kuch kii khurdari tathaa khadianuma hoti he
 The color of eggs also varies in different sparrows
 kuch chidiyon ke andey bilkul safed hote hai, kintu kuch ke andey rangeen, hare, nile, bhure or lalachaunh hote hai
 Some have the same color of eggs and some have pinto or speckled
 chitiyaan dhabbe ke rup main, athwa chaktton ke rup main hoti he or thodi athwa atyadhik sankhya main hoti hai
 The spots may be evenly scattered on the surface of the eggs, or more in one part and less in another
 kuch jati ke pakshiyon main ek hi jati ke antargat vibhinn sadasyon ke andon ke rang or chihnon main vyaktigat bhinnata hoti he
 Egg color is predominantly defensive
 atev hari daaliyon par die janevaale andon kaa rang haraa or jameen par die janevaale andon kaa rang praaia: bhura hota he
 Cotter or burrow eggs are often white, so that birds can detect them even in the dark
 gilmaat or regerbil keval ek hi anda detii hai, paravat yaa junglee kabutar or garud do, dhomara yaa gangachilli kii vibhinn jatiyaan teen or tittibh kii anek jatiyaan chaar andey detii hai
 Many species lay up to five to six eggs
 kuch gaanevaali choti kism kii chidiyon main saat aath se lekar das baarah tak andey milte hai
 Some hunting birds and ducks have even higher numbers
 adhikansh chidiyaan, yadi unke andey chura liye jaaain, athwa nasht ho jaaain, athwa andon ko tyaagane ke liye ve baadhya kar di jaayen, to phir se andey detii hai, kyonki har pakshi ke andon kii ek nishchit sankhya hoti he
 Until this number is reached, it does not stop laying eggs
 chidiyaan saadharantaya ek ritu main ek hi baar ade detii hai
 Some singing birds produce children two or three times during the season
 jin chidiyon ke andey or bachche adhik nasht hote hai, athwa jo alpaayu hoti hai, unamem janan teevr gati se or andon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 The age of sparrows also affects their number of eggs
 pratham baar maan bananevaali chidiyaan kam or duusari yaa teesri baar andey denevaali chidiyaan adhik andey detii hai
 When the number of eggs is complete, their army begins
 pakshi badi lagan or tatparta se andey sete hai, apane pankhons se unhen garam rakhte tathaa unki raksha karte hai : In most castes, both males and females perform the function of ovulation, even though the hatching works slightly more then the other
 kabhi kabhi din main maadaa andey seti he or raatri main nar
 In some castes, only females lay eggs, but in such a state the male raises food for it
 kisi kisi jati main nar or maadaa baari baari sein aate jate rahete hai
 During the egg-intake period, the female gets attention in hatching and such a concentration is created that if someone removes her eggs and keeps any other thing, like stone pieces, ballasts, etc
, then she will be without See, they will sit and sit on them
 bahudhaa aisa dekha gaya he ki andon ke kharaab yaa nirjeev ho jane par bhi maadaa ek lambii avadhi tak unhen seti rahati he
 In pigeons, the male incubates the egg with great fervor
 yahi nahin, balki maadaa ko hataakar swayan andon par baithta he
 The male cannot give himself, but in the desire of childbirth, he somehow binds the female and binds her, fetches the eggs from the female and then performs all the activities of her hatching and grooming herself with great enthusiasm
 lapland or ouk jati ke pakshiyon main nar kii sankhya adhik he, maadaa kii kam
 Thus, not all male pairs are successful in tying, but their desire for hatching and rearing of children does not go through their heart
 isse thik vipareet kuch pakshi aise bhi hai, jo andon ko swayan na sekar dusron se sevate hai
 Cuckoo, papiha etc
 are the main among them, who steal their eggs in the nests of crows, sparrows or satbhaiya etc
 and fool them and take care of them as midwives
 kuch aise pakshi hai, jo andon ko na to swayan sete hai or na auron se sevate hai, balki unhen dhoop ke taap se pakaakar unki raksha karte hai
 a bird named Ostrich prepares the pit with the rubbing of its chest and erects a wall by placing sand with a beak around it
 phir isi main maadaaen, praaia: 20 se 30 tak, andey dete hai
 Ostrich does not have a single female, a male has many wives and all of them pass eggs in turn
 andey dene kaa kaam puraa ho jane par, inpar ek halki si baaluu kii parat bicha di jaati he
 These eggs are warmed by the rays of the sun throughout the day
 ratrikaal main ye pakshi inpar baithper inhen ushnata pradaan karte hai
 There are many birds, which are built near a hot spring and lay eggs in them, then cover them and go elsewhere
 jharne ke ushn jal se ye andey garam rahete hai
 At the end of the time, they come back and remove the top soil, then the children come out after breaking the eggs
 jahaan atyadhik garmi padati hai, vahaan ke pakshi andon ko thandha rakhane kii vyavastha karte hai, garam rakhane kii nahin
 For this, they soak their beaks in water and soak eggs in them, so that they do not get damaged due to excessive heat
 sevankaal bhi, chidiyon main vibhinn hota he
 In larger sparrows or in sparrows whose children develop well, the intake period is longer
 kisi kisi main sevankaal ek maheene kaa or kisi kisi main do saptaah se bhi kam kaa hota he
 Months are spent incubating eggs on a bird
 murgi ko anda sene main teen saptaah lagate hai, teetar ko chaar, hans ko paanch tathaa cander naamak pakshi ko puure do maheene
 Birds' eggs are laid outside and embryonic development takes place inside the eggs
 bhrun ke purna viksit ho jane par vihang shishu andey rupi kaidakhane se baahar aane ke liye apni chonch se baar baar prahaar karata he or andey ke bichon bich, athwa anya kisi chaude sthal par jatibhed ke anusaar, ek daraar ho jaati he or shishu baahar nikal aata he
 At that time he remains soaked with a fluid, which dries up quickly due to wind
 murgi, teetar, shuturamurg aadi ke bachche to nikalate hi daudna shuru kar dete hai, par tote, phakhte or coy aadi ke shishu kai dinon tak aankh nahin khol pate,
 They remain in a state of immortality and spend their infancy days in weeks in Dhansale
 andey se baahar aane par shishu chidiya ke pratham kuch saptaah kuch vishesh kathinaaiyon evam khataron ke hote hai
 These days she is not only small and weak, but often unable to swallow food herself and is also helpless by flying
 bhinn jati ke pakshiyon ke shishu bhinn avasthaa main utpann hote hai or is aadhaar par unka vargeekaran nimnlikhit do pramukh shreniyon main kiya ja saktaa he : The eyes of a dormant baby are open from birth and their body is covered with soft feathers
 ye aarambh se hi satark tathaa chanchal hote hai or daud yaa tair sakate hai
 Yes, if they are not teased, then after birth they would like to remain silent for a few hours
 ye prarambh se hi apana dana swayan chugana shuru kar dete hai
 Ducks and chickens are good examples of this
 junglee chidiyon main tittibh, jalkukkuti, batakh or shikaar kii anya chidiyon ke shishu bhi aisa hi karte hai
 Another feature of hunting birds is that they also start flying soon
 needvasi shishu janm ke pashchaat bade hone tak ghonsle main hi pade rahete hai or inhen aahaar ke liye apane maan baap par hi purnat: nirbhar rahanaa padataa hai
 They are blind and helpless at birth and more or less bare in most cases; That is, they are non-smoking and unattractive
 bataakhi, kilkila ; or harith kashthakut ke shishu bilkul nange utpann hote hai
 Cormorant and Buck are a group of birds whose children are completely naked at birth, that is, they live on very little on their body
 pakshi jis tatparta ke saath andey sete hai, usee tatparta se apni santan kaa paalan poshan evam rakshan bhi karte hai
 In child protection it is often seen that birds do not even worry about their lives
 santanraksha main tarah-tarah kii bahanebaajiyaan karke ye pakshi aagatuk ko achambhe main bhi daale dete hai
 Often they start to see it and hang it as if they were injured by a hunter
 dushman shikari, badhik, shwaan, shrugaladi inhen pakadaney kii aashaa lekar jab inkaa peechha karte hai, to ye dur tak chakma dete hue nikal jate hai or tab ekaek teji se udakar kahin chal dete hai
 In this way, taking the enemy away from the nest and astray him, so that he can move in some other direction and avoid the calamity on the babies of the needles
 chidiyaan dusron kii aankh main dhul jhonknaa bhi khub jaanati hai
 When they are sometimes surrounded, they lie dead and lie on the ground, which the viewer considers them dead and moves forward
 phir ye sheeghra jameen chhodkar aage bhaag khadi hoti he
 Sometimes even if caught, they pretend to be dead, so that we can leave them as dead

 railway sanketak pranali kaa vyavhaar railgadee ke chaalkon ko railpath kii aage kii dasha kii soochna dene ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The signaling system is the key to safe and fast movement of trains today
 railway signal saadharantah railpath par lage hue un sthavar sanketakon ko kehete hai jinase rail chaalak ko railpath ke agle khand kii dasha kaa gyaan ho sake
 Initially there was no such signal and some mounted sentries went to clear the way in front of the first train from Darlington to Stockton
 uske baad is kaam ko nishchit duriyon par santriyon ko khadaa karke kiya jane laga
 With the progress of time, real singles were replaced in place of these sentries
 sansar kaa pehla signal england ke hatlpul stesan ke stesan master kii mej par mombatti lagaakar banaaya gaya tha
 Only after this, round signals like saucer started
 america main san 1832 main jab vashpachaalit injanon dwaara gadiyon kaa parivahan prachlit kiya gaya, tab newcasil tathaa french toun ke bich 17 mile kii dulari se gendnuma siganlon kii pranali prayog main laai gai
 In this system, about 30 feet high pillars were placed on three-three miles
 jaise hi ek gaadi ek ore se chalaai jaati, vahaan kaa jhandi vaala ek safed gend khambhe kii puri oonchaai par chadha detaa
 The flagman next to the next pole would see this ball through his telescope, and a similar white ball would be mounted on its pole from the top to the bottom
 har agle khambhevala isi prakaar pichley khambhe ko dekhakar apni-apni gend chadha detaa
 Thus within a few minutes the station would know about the running of the train from the other side and they would be alert
 yadi gaadi apane samay par nahin chal paati, to safed gend ke sthaan par kaali gend chadha di jaati
 Thus this system proved to be a great help in driving the car before the invention of giving information by wire
 par us samay signal kaa kaante or parpath main koi antahpashan nahin hota tha or kaante parpath kii pratikul dasha main hote hue bhi sanketak 'anukool' avasthaa main kiya ja saktaa tha
 Due to this, there was no complete safety and any human error made the possibility of accident
 isko dur karne ke liye sanketak tathaa kaante parpath kaa antahpashan kiya gaya jisase yadi kaante crossing hon to sanketak ko 'anukool' nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Initially, this interpolation was mechanical
 par vigyaan kii pragati tathaa riley ke avishkaar se ab vidyut antahpashan hota he
 Mechanical interpolation was first used in England in 1843 at the bricklayer-arm junction
 america main iskaa prayog san 1874 main prarambh hua tathaa bharat main san 1912 main
 With the invention of the track circuit in 1871, it became possible to use the automatic signaling system
 isaki sahaayta se gadiyon ke aane-jane ke saath hi apane aap bina kisi bahya sahaayta ke vidyut dwaara sanketak agle khand kii dasha ke anusaar anukool 'satarkta' athwa 'sankat' avasthaa main pahunch jate hai
 The progress of indicator system for traffic control with the help of track circuit and relay has been anticipated
 ab to ek doorvarti kendriya sthaan se yatayaat kaa sugamawapurvak sanchaalan kiya ja saktaa he
 Such operations are called centralized traffic control
 bharat main jis samay rail parivahan prarambh hua us samay ghoomane vaale tashtareenuma yaa alag-alag rang ke shishon kii haath-roshni vaale sanketak prayog main laae gaye
 If the perfect goal indicator made a right angle from the line, then there would have been an indication of 'crisis' that the path ahead was 'favorable' and could go
 uske baad steshnon par ek hi khambhe par donon disha ke liye sanketak lagaae gaye
 There was a different up and down arm pointer for each direction, and the station master dropped the pointer on the same side as the train he wanted to allow
 aise sanketakon kaa to 25 saal pehle tak bhi kuch bhaagon main vyavhaar hota rahaa he
 Till 1892 there was no systematic signaling system in India
 is saal north-western railway par shri ji
ech
 liston ne crossing steshnon par ek vishesh yantra lagaakar siganlon kaa tathaa kaante crossing ke antahpashan kii vyavastha kaa ek mahatvapurn kaary kiya
 With the help of this device, it was assured that if the indicator is 'favorable' then the thorn crossing would definitely be favorable and hence there is no need to slow the speed of the car which was necessary without this system
 san 1894 main shri e
 morse ke sahyog se apane yantra main aavashyak sanshodhan karke list or morse pranali ko prachlit kiya
 Due to this system, the list and more are called the 'father' of the signaling system of India
 san 1904 tak signal tathaa kaante crossing ke antahpashan kii chaabi stesan master ke paas vaahak dwaara bheji jaati thi jise dekhakar vah sanketak ko 'anukool' kar detaa tha, par isse chaabi le jane or laane main vyarth samay nasht hota tha or yatayaat kii gati main rukaawat padati thi
 To overcome this, Major Lailes Hepper, who was a signal engineer of the North Western Railway and later G
I
P
 He also became the general manager of the railway, arranging to take this key to the station master by electricity
 aisi chaabiyon ko 'haper transmeter' kehete hai or is avishkaar se yatayaat kii gati ko badi sahaayta mili
 Cabin interpolation was invented by John Saxby and was initially used on British Railways
 beesvin shatabdi ke shuru main bhartiya relon main bhi iskaa prachlan shuru hua
 Some of its plans were prepared by Messrs
 Saxby and Farmer Firm in 1893 but it was adopted only when there was a need for interpolation to keep it safe as the speed of the trains and traffic increased
 sabase pehle ji
ai
pi
 railway par bombai or dilli ke maarg main hi cabin antahpashan kaa bahut bade paimaane par prayog hua
 This phase was completed in 1912
 isi prakaar baad main anya relon ke mukhya margon par bhi inhen chaalu kiya gaya
 Dual-wire indicators occupy a prominent position in mechanical signaling systems
 isamen cabin se kaante, pashadandon parichaayakon tathaa sanketakon ke parichaalan ke liye do taron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This system is now widely practiced on Indian Railways and is considered superior to other mechanical signaling systems
 dohare taar kii sanketak pranali main sabase bada laabh yah hota he ki iske dwaara adhik lambii nappi hui chaal praapt kii ja sakati he or is kaaran adhik duuri tak bina kathinaayee ke sanketakon par niyantran kiya ja saktaa he
 Thorn crossings can be operated efficiently up to 800 yards by this system instead of 500 yards by rods and the indicator can work up to 1500 yards
 is pranali main sanketakon ke 'sankat' sthiti main waapas laane ke liye pratibhaar jaise avishwasaneey tareeke ko apnaane kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin rahati he or sanketak ko purv dasha main laane ke liye liver ko sakriy rup main kheenchna hota he
 This makes unauthorized operation in the dual-wire indicator system impossible
 saath hi swachaalit pratipurakon ke prayog dwaara sanketakon kii chaal main taap parivartan kaa bhi koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 The use of this system is also economically beneficial as it can easily operate loop line stations up to 1000 yards long or more from the central cabin itself, thereby saving a cabin and its operating expenses
 
 liver dhaanchaa dohari taar pranali ke liye liver dhaanchaa do 10 inch-3 inch kii channelon ko jodakar uske bich main liver lagaakar banaaya jaataa he
 These channels are connected by bolts in the cabin walls
 liver ek dhol ke aakaar kaa hota he jisamen upyukt maap kaa ek handls laga rahata he jiske dwaara dhol ko 180 ansh tak ghumaya ja saktaa he or is prakaar icchit nirdisht maatra main ghumaane se sanketak kii dasha badali ja sakati he
 With each liver connected separately, any of them can be easily replaced
 sanket chaalak yantra sanket yantra kaa prayog sanketak ke sanchaalan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 By this, the indicator can be brought to any degree at 0 degree, 45 degree, or 90 degree angle
 inkaa pariklpan is prakaar hota he ki isamen sanketak ke kisi or kone yaa dasha main rah sakane kii sambhaavna nahin rahati tathaa taar tuutane kii dasha main sanketak fouran 'sankat' suchak dasha main pahunch jaataa he
 Fork driver - For the speed of a fork, a serrated rod is stuck with a mechanical wheel
 yah chad kaante ko chaal detaa he tathaa pashan chad ko bhi chalaata he jiske kaaran kaanta apane sthaan par pahunchne ke saath hi pashit ho jaataa he
 Also, there is a provision that if the wire breaks, the fork stays in its place and no motion can be made in it
 parichaalak -dohare taar kii sanket pranali main ek or atyant upyogi saadhan jo kaam main laayaa jaataa he 'parichaayak' he
 Its function is to check the right fork of the passageway
 parivahan suraksha main is jaanch kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 With this check, the detective also holds the fork in its place when the wire breaks
 parichaayak kaante ke paas hi lagaaya hua ek chakra hota he jo sanket pranali ke taron ke saath judaa rahata he or unki chaal ke saath hi ghumta he
 The outer part of this wheel has grooves that are stuck in iron rods that move with thorns
 is prakaar yadi kaanta 'pratikul' dasha main he, to sanketak kaa 'anukool' disha main kiya ja sakna asambhav ho jaataa he
 Automated signaling system - In the early twentieth century, the practice of connecting rail lines to signals by electricity was introduced in track circulating, and at major stations in India respectively
 trek sarkiting se bijli dwaara yah gyaat ho jaataa he ki aage kii raah par koi gaadi yaa kisi or kism kii koi rukaawat to nahin he
 Automated signaling system is also possible through track circuiting
 isse dohari linon par ek ke peeche ek gadiyon ko kuch minuton ke antar par chalaanaa sambhav ho gaya he
 As soon as the train enters a segment, the starting indicator of that section starts displaying the 'crisis' condition and before that the indicator of the start of the section gives 'alert' information
 jaise hi gaadi khand se baahar nikal jaati he, sanketak phir apane aap 'anukool' dasha main aa jaataa he
 In this way, the driver of the train knows that there is no carriage or blockage in the next sections
 yadi hoti he to vah satarkta se kaam letaa he or gaadi roak detaa he
 There are mainly five types of indicators used for traffic: simafor bhujaa sanketak Color light indicator prakaash sthiti sanketak Color light indicator chaalak koshth sanketak Indicators of different sign with the position of the arm on the pillar are called Seemafor indicators
 bhujaa kii chaal neeche kii ore nichle vrutt paad yaa upar kii ore upree vrutt paad ho sakati he
 Downward motion indicators indicate only two conditions
 bhujaa kii anuprastha dasha 'sankat' suchak hoti he tathaa 45 ansh kaa kone banaati hui dasha 'suraksha' suchak hoti he
 In contrast, the upper speed indicators indicate three conditions
 inamen bhi bhujaa kii anuprastha dasha sankat suchak hoti he
 In the second case, the arm makes an angle of 45 degrees upwards
 yah 'satarkta' suchak hoti he
 In the third case, the arm straightens up and is 'favorable', which shows that the path is clear and the driver can move at full speed
 upree chaal main teen dashaon kii soochna ho sakane ke kaaran chaalak ko 'sankat' se pehle roak sakane ke liye paryaapt samay mil jaataa he or isliye yadi sanketak kii bhujaa suraksha dasha main hai, to vah bina hichak puri gati par chal saktaa he
 Arm indicators cannot be used at night
 is kaaran raatri main unke sthaan par rangeen roshni dwaara sanket kiya jaataa he
 Red light is indicated for 'crisis' information
 'satarkta' ke liye pili tathaa 'anukool path' ke liye hari roshni kaa prayog karte hai
 The light of the indicator is made so fast with the help of electricity and lenses that the lights can be indicated by colored light even during the day
 is prakaar aadhunik sanketak din raat main ek hi tarah kaa sanket dete hai tathaa bahut dur se dikhaai de sakate hai
 This type of indicator is used in very few places
 inamen do yaa adhik prakaashon kii sthiti dwaara sanket diya jaataa he tathaa pile rang kii batti kaam main laai jaati he
 It is used in America on a railway administration
 laal battiyaan anuprastha dasha main sankat kii soochna detii hai
 Yellow lights at a 45 degree angle are the vigilance indicator and green lights in an upright position indicate 'favorable'
 chaalak ke saamne koshth main sthit sanketak ko koshth sanketak kehete hai or agle khand kii avasthaa ke anusaar koshth main lagaataar sanket miltaa rahata he
 This vault signal is made possible only by the invention of the track circuit and with its help, the driver is kept aware of how far the line is clear and thus he can control the speed of his car accordingly
 railway paribhaasha main antahpashan kaa arth signal tathaa kaante or parpathon kii chaal par is prakaar niyantran karnaa hota he ki ve ek-duusare ke pratikul kaary na kar saken
 While describing the historical progress, it has been said that interpolation was mechanical initially, but with the advancement of science, interpolation also made a lot of progress by electricity and relay and now there is such a system of interpolation that by setting a path As soon as its indicators are favorable, other indicators and fork crossings are automatically trapped in such a way that even a thorn mistake can cause any conflicting communication
 Unlike the LN
 mukhyatah do prakaar ke antahpashan hote hai yantric antahpashan tathaa vidyut antahpashan
 In mechanical interpolation, the movement of the liver is done by mechanical manipulation of the liver in such a way that the movement of the contrasting liver stops
 vidyut antahpashan main liveron kii chaal se vidyut pravaah main is prakaar kii rukaawat paidaa kar di jaati he ki virodhabhasi liver na chal sake
 The following systems are notable in the progress of power injection and are being used at various places
 is pranali main sanketak is prakaar blaak yantra se antahpashit rahata he ki jab tak gaadi khand ko paar karke uske baahar nahin ho jaati, duusari gaadi ke liye line clear nahin diya ja saktaa tathaa sambandhit sanketak bhi 'anukool' nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It was only after the use of electric powered indicators that the use of electromagnetic interference began
 iskaa yantra yantric antahpashan ke yantra kii hi bhanti hota he jiske upar vidyut niyantrak athwa liver lage hote hai jo ki ek liver kii chaal ke baad duusare virodhabhasi yantron kii chaal roak dete hai
 Thorn passages and loop are operated by mechanical livers with the help of pipes and barbells
 vidyut sanketakon kaa niyantran bijli ke liver kii sahaayta se karte hai
 The operation of the interlocking thorns of this process is done by pressurized air and the pressure of cylinders of pressurized air
 Is controlled by electricity
 iske liye 12 volt kii bijli istemaal hoti he
 An air of 75 pounds per square inch is used for handling thorns
 is prakaar ke yantra kaa prayog aise sthanon main hota he jahaan kaanton kaa sanchaalan shighrata se karnaa hota he
 In this type of interpolation, the work of thorns and indicators is done with electricity
 kaanton ke sanchaalan ke liye bijli ke motor lagaae jate hai
 This device is mostly operated by 110 volt direct current, but sometimes 119 volt alternating current is also used
 is antahpashan main kaanta jab tak apni puri chaal praapt nahin kar letaa, tab tak sanketak anukool dasha nahin dikhaa saktaa or is tarah kaante kii chaal ke bich main atakane par bhi gaadi ke line se utar jane kii durghatana asambhav ho jaati he
 This system also exists in electrical condenser intraspecies
 is prakaar ke antahpashan kaa prayog dilli ke paas sabji mandi stesan par kiya gaya tha
 Electrical interpolation cannot be practiced in places where there is a risk of drowning of electric motors due to floods in the rain
 yantric antahpashan ke sthaan par ab riley antahpashan kaa paryaapt prayog hone laga he
 Electrical circuits are controlled by the relay in such a way that if one circuit is working then the other circuit which has the movement of opposing indicators or thorns may not work
 riley ke avishkaar se antahpashan kaa kaary kaaphi suvidha se hone laga he or bade-bade steshnon kaa kaary thode se sthaan main alp jansankhya se kiya ja saktaa he
 The latest progress after relay interpolation has been interpolation
 iske dwaara sanchaalak yadi ek path kisi gaadi ke liye nirdhaarit karke sthapit kar detaa he, to saare virdohi path, jinase kisi or gaadi ke us path par aane kii sambhaavna ho, antahpashit ho jate hai or sthapit nahin kiye ja sakate
 In setting up such a path, various indicators and thorns have to suppress the buttons
 iske sthaan par ab aisi vyavastha bhi hone lagi he ki vividh batano ke sthaan par ek path ke sthaapan ke liye keval ek batan dabaate hi sara path sthapit ho jaataa he or uske sanket anukool dasha main aa jate hai
 At the same time, all opposing paths become ingrained so that they cannot be established
 kisi bhi sthapit path ko radd bhi kiya ja saktaa he, yadi kisi samay us path ke sthaan par duusare path ko sthapit karne kii aavashyaktaa ho
 For this, there are cancel buttons for every path
 ek batan se path sthaapan kii vyavastha ko ek niyantran-switch-vyavastha kehete hai tathaa iske dwaara yatayaat bahut ghanaa hone par bhi ati sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 The path relay interpolation and a control-switch-arrangement have a map of the entire yard in front of the operator, whose lines may be illuminated by valves
 ek path ke sthapit hote hi usamen roshni ho jaati he tathaa jaise hi us path par gaadi aa jaati he vahaan safed ke sthaan par laal roshni ho jaati he
 The lights are extinguished as soon as the car is cleared and another path can be established
 is prakaar sanchaalak teji se ek ke baad doosraa path bhinn dishaao se aane vaali gadiyon ke liye sathapit karata chalaa jaataa he
 Relay interpolation has been used in many places in India, but path interpolation was also used at many stations in Madras, Bombay, Delhi
