 However, many proponents of structuralism, such as Jacques Lacan, began to emphasize the continental beliefs and core assumptions of its critics that post-structuralism is a continuation of structuralism
 elizan asister ke anusaar, sanrachnawad se sambandhit chaar aam vichaar ek 'bauddhik pravriti' kii rachana karte hai
 The term structuralism is often used to refer to a specific type of humanistic structuralist analysis where facts are referred to by the science of signs

 However, the term is also used in diverse contexts of structural approaches such as social network analysis and class analysis

 Ferdinand de Saussure's work on linguistics is generally considered the starting point of structuralism
 francisi maanavvigyaani claude levi-strans ke kaaryon main khud "sanrachnawad" shabd prakat hua or france main "sanrachnawadi andolan" ko badhaava diya, jisane lui althujar, manovishleshak jacks lekan jaise vichaarkon ko hi nahin sanrachnawadi marxvaadi nicos polantzaas ke kaaryon ko bhi prerit kiya
 Most of the members of this movement have not described themselves as being a part of any such movement

 Post-structuralism attempted to separate itself from the simple use of structural method

 For example, some intellectuals such as Julia Kristeva later took structuralism as a starting point for becoming post-structuralist
 saamaajik vigyaan main sanrachnawad ke prabhaav kii kai sthitiyaan hai: jo samajashaastra ke kshetra main kaaphi myne rakhata he
 Structuralism suggests that human culture should be understood as a system of signs
 robert scoles ne sanrachnawad ko aadhuniktaavaadi algaav or niraashaa kii pratikriya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 Structuralists attempted to develop a symbolic science
 ferdinand di sausar 20 veen sadi ke sanrachnawad ke pravartak maane jate hai or iske saboot hamen unki mrityu ke baad unke chaatro ke noton par aadhaarit unke sahyogiyon dwaara likhe gayi course in general linguistic main mil sakate hai, jisamen unhone bhashaa ke istemaal par nahin balki bhashaa kii antarnihit pranali par dhyaan kendrit kiya he or apane siddhanth ko sanket vigyaan kaha he
 However, it is only through examining speech that the underlying system can be discovered
 jaise ki sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan asal main kosh bhashaa vigyaan kaa purv swaroop he
 This approach focused on examining how language related elements are interconnected in the present, that is, in a chronological and not 'contemporary' way
 Finally, he argued that linguistic signs are made up of two parts, the word form and the concept
 This was quite different from previous approaches that focused on the relationship between words and the objects in the world 178–179)
 sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan main pratimaan, vaakya vinyas or mulya kunjee yaa mukhya vichaar hai, haalanki sausar ke vichaar main abhi tak in vichaaron ko puri tarah se viksit nahin kiya gaya tha
 a structural paradigm is basically a class of linguistic units in a given linguistic environment at a given position, which is syntam
 pratimaan ke in prayek sadasyon ke vibhinn kaaryon kii bhoomika ko vailu kaha jaataa he
 Structuralist criticism relates to a larger comprehensive literary text of structure that may be a design of a particular genre, a category of inter-communicative relations, a sample of a universal speech structure or a notion of a narrative of recurring patterns or an arrangement of design
 is
 sausar ke paathyakram ne pratham vishwayuddh or dwitiya vishwayuddh ke bich kai bhashavidon ko prabhavit kiya tha, udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main leonard bluemafield ne, denmark main lui jemaslebh ne or norge main olf samarfelt ne apana nijee sanrachanaatmak bhashaa vigyaan viksit kiya
 Antoine Millet and Emily Benveniste will continue Saussure's program in France
 However, most importantly, members of the Prague school of linguistics, such as Roman Jacobson and Nikolai Trubejkoy, did research that would be quite influential
 praha skool ke sanrachnawad kaa sabase spasht udhaaharan swanim ke drusht main nihit he
 In Prague school, not only were the lists of different voices of the language compiled, but it was also investigated how they were related
 unhone sabit kar diya ki bhashaa main dhvaniyon kaa sankalan kar unke vyatirek kii shrinkhalaa banaakar unhen vishleshit kiya ja saktaa tha
 Thus it seems that / p / and / b / in English represent different phonemes because there are cases where there is only as much difference between the two as between two opposite words
 virdohi vaishishtyon kii drushti se dhvaniyon kaa vishleshan tulanaatmak kshetra prastut karata he, udhaaharan ke liye, yah spasht karata he ki japani vaktaaon ko angreji kii / aar / or / el / dhvaniyon main antar karne main jo kathinaayee hoti he, vah isliye he kyonki japani main ye dhvaniyaan paraspar virdohi nahin hai
 Although this approach is now standard in linguistics, it was revolutionary at the time
 dhwani vigyaan vibhinn kshetron main sanrachnawad ke liye nirdeshnatmak aadhaar ban jayega
 According to structural theory in anthropology and social anthropology, meaning is produced and reproduced within a culture through various ways, events, and activities, which are used as important systems
 ek sanrachnawadi bhojan banane or parosane kii taiyaari, dharmik sanskaron, khel, saahitiyik or gaiyr saahitiyik granthon ke rup main vividh gatividhiyon tathaa manoranjan ke anya roopon kaa adhyayan kar ek samskruti ke bheetar un gambhir sanrachanaon kaa pataa lagaataa he jinke dwaara arth ko utpaadit or punarutpaadit kiya jaataa he
 For example, Claude Levi Strauss, an early and prominent professionalist of structuralism, ethnographer and anthropologist, analyzed cultural events in 1950, including mythology, relationships, and food preparation
 in adhyayanon ke alaava unhone adhik bhashaayi-kendrit lekhan kiya jahaan unhone maanav mastishk kii moulik sanrachanaon kii khoj ke liye bhashaa or parole ke bich sausar ke parthaky kaa vyavhaar kiya, unka tark he ki samaaj ke "gambhir vyakaran" kii rachana karne vaali sanrachanaayen hamaare dimag main utpann hoti hai or hamaare andar anjaane main kaary karti rahati hai
 Levi Strauss was inspired by information theory and mathematics
 ek anya avadharana praha skool se udhaar lee gayi, jisamen roman jaikabsan or anya logon ne katipay visheshtaon kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti ke aadhaar par dhvaniyon kaa vishleshan kiya
 Levi Strauss incorporated it into the concept of universal structures of his brain, which he used in enforcement based on pairings as opposed to women as hot-cold, male-female, culture-nature, puckered-raw or marriage vs
 forbidden
 ek teesraa prabhaav marcel mouss se aayaa jisane uphaar vinimay pranali par likhaa he
 For example, Levi Strauss, based on Mauss, argued that relationship systems are based on the exchange of women between groups as opposed to the principle of 'descent' described by Edward Evans Pritchard and Mayer Fortes
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main apane ichole partikue hautes itudes chair main marcel mouss ko hataa kar levi straas kaa lekhan bahut lokapriy hua or isane khud "sanrachnawad" shabd ko kaaphi vistaar diya
 britain main rodney nidham or edmund leach jaise lekhak sanrachnawad dwaara atyadhik prabhavit the
 In France, writers such as Maurice Godlier and Emmanuel Terry associated Marxism with structural anthropology
 In the United States, authors such as Marshall Sullins and James Boon moved forward with structuralism to provide their analysis of human society
 Structural anthropology lost its popularity in the 1980s due to several reasons
 De Andrade holds that structuralism in anthropology was eventually abandoned because it prevailed unprovable assumptions about the universal structure of the human brain
 erik woolf jaise lekhakon ne tark diya ki raajnneetik arthvyavastha or upniveshwaad ko nrivigyaan ke maamle main or adhik aage rakhaa janaa chahie
 or aam taur par, piyare aurdiu dwaara sanrachnawad kii aalochanaayen is vichaar kii ore le gayin ki maanav sansthaaen tathaa vyavhaar kis prakaar saanskrithik or saamaajik sanrachanaon ko badal rahe the, ek aisa chalan jise sheri atner ne 'abhyaas siddhant' kaha he
 However, some anthropological theorists who discovered notable mistakes in Levi Strauss's version of structuralism, could not retreat from a basic structural basis for human culture
 The Biogenetic Structuralism group argued that there must be some kind of structural basis for culture because every human brain structure has the same system
 unhone ek prakaar ke neuroenthropology ko prastaavit kiya jo saanskrithik ekarupata kaa aadhaar banataa or saanskrithik anthropology tathaa neurosience ke bich ekikaran main vibhinnata kaayam karata-ek aisa kaarykram jise victor turnar jaise siddhantkaar ne apanaaya tha
 Structuralism in literary theory is the system of analyzing reading material by examining the underlying immutable structure that is based on the linguistic sign system of Ferdinand de Saussure
 sanrachnawadiyon kaa maananaa he ki har paath main sanrachana honi chahie, jo isaki vyakhya karata hai ki anbhavi pathakon ke liye kisi paath ko samajhnaa kisi gaiyr anbhavi pathak ke mukaable kis tarah se zyada aasaan he
 Therefore, they say that whatever is written seems to be governed by specific rules of "grammar of literature", which people learn in an educational institution and should be exposed
 sanrachnawadiyon ke spashtikaran kii ek sambhavit samasya yah he ki vah behad sankshipt ho saktaa he jaisaa ki vidwaan catherine belsi ne kaha he, "sabhi matbhedon ko dhaha sakane vaala sanrachnawadi khatra"
 aise pathan kaa udhaaharan tab ho saktaa he jab koi chaatr west said story padhane ke baad likhata he ki lekhak ne "vastav" main kuch nayaa nahin likhaa he, kyonki unke lekhan main shakespeare kii romeo juuliyat jaisi sanrachana he
 Both incarnations depict love between a girl and a boy while both of them were associated with groups who hated each other and the conflict ended only after their deaths
 sanrachnawadi pathan main is baat par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he ki ekal paath kis prakaar se katha kii sanrachanaon main antarnihit tanaav ko mitaatha he
 If a structuralist reading focuses on several texts, then there must be a coherent system in which those texts are connected to each other
 sanrachnawad main aisi bahumukhi pratibha he ki ek hi kahani ko saahitiyik aalochana se alag rup diya ja saktaa he, jaise ki do mithravat parivaar apane bacchon kii shaadi tay kar dete hai, yah jaanate hue ki donon bachche ek-duusare se nafrat karte hai or aakhir main is shaadi se dur rahane ke liye ve donon aatmahatya kar lete hai; iskaa nishkarsh yah he ki duusari kahani kii sanrachana pehali kahani kii sanrachana ke ekadam vipareet he: do pyaar karne waalon or donon jodon kii parivaar ke rishte main ekadam ulta sambandh dikhaaya gaya he
 Literary criticism of structuralism argues that the "new value of the literary text" may be present in character development and nuances of voice rather than the new structure from which the structure is expressed
 saahitiyik sanrachnawad kii ek shakha, jaise ki frydwad, marxvad or parivartankaree vyakaran, ek gahari or ek satahi sanrachana, donon ko maanate hai
 The deep structure in Freudism and Marxism is a story, in Freud's case, the battle is ultimately between the instincts of life and death, and in Marx the struggle lies between classes which have their roots in the economic base
 saahitiyik sanrachnawad kathaon, mithkon or haal hi main laghukthaon main aadharbhoot gahare tatwon kii talash ke liye aksar vladimir praap, algrids julian gremas or claude levi straas ke drushtaanton kaa anusaran karte hai, jo vibhinn prakaar se ur-kahani yaa ur-mithkon ke anek sanskarnon ke utpaadan se sanyukt hai
 Like Freud and Marx but unlike transformational grammar, these basic elements are semantic
 sanrachanaatmak saahitiyik siddhant or narthrope frai kii adyaprarupiy aalochana ke bich kaaphi samanta he, jo mithkon ke maanavshastreey adhyayan kaa bhi rini he
 Some critics have also tried to apply the theory of individual works, but the attempt to find unique structures in individual work runs counter to the structural program and is paralleled by new criticism
 saahitiyik sanrachnawad kii anya shakha sanketikta he or yah ferdinand di sausar ke kaam par aadhaarit he
 Existentialism propounded by Jean Paul Sartre was the dominant emotion in the 1940s and 1950s
 france main pratham vishwayuddh dablyoodablyooiai ke baad or vishesh rup se 1960 ke dashak main sanrachnawad surkhiyon main aayaa
 The early popularity of structuralism in France spread it worldwide
 The social sciences were heavily influenced by it
 sanrachnawad ne maanav swatantraaa or pasand kii avadharana ko khaarij kar diya or is baat par jor diya ki maanav vyavhaar vibhinn sanrachanaon se nirdhaarit hota he
 The most important early work in this regard was the 1949 edition of Claude Levi Strauss, Elementary Structures of Kinship
 levi straas pratham vishwayuddh dablyoodablyooiai ke dauraan neuyark main jaikabsan ke sampark main aae the or ve jaikabsan ke sanrachnawad or america maanav vigyaan parampara donon se prabhavit the
 In Elementary Structures he examined kinship systems from a structural point of view and explained how different social organizations are in fact an altered form of certain foundational kinship structures
 1950 ke dashak ke uttararddh main unhone strectural anthropolaji prakashit kiya jo sanrachnawad ke liye unke kaarykram kii ruparekha par likhe nibandhon kaa ek sangrah he
 Structuralism itself began to emerge as a movement by the early 1960s, and some believed that it offered an integrated way to human life that would embrace all perspectives
 Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida focused on how structuralism can be used in literature
 frid or di sausar kaa sammishran kar francisi sanrachnawadi jacks lekan ne sanrachnawad ko manovishleshan main prayukt kiya or jin piget ne alag tareeke se sanrachnawad ko manovigyaan ke adhyayan main prachlit kiya
 But Jean Piget, who defines himself as a better creationist, considers structuralism "not a theory but a method" because for him "there is no construction without structure, be it abstract or genetic"
 mishael phokalt kii pustak da order of things ne yah pataa lagane ke liye vigyaan ke itihaas kii jaanch kii ki gyanamimansaa yaa gyaan kii sanrachanaon ne kis tarah aisa maarg banaaya jisase logon ne gyaan or jaankaree kii kalpana kii 
 In a similar vein, the American historian of science, Thomas Coon, in his fundamental science structures also made The Structure of Scientific Revolutions - as the title itself suggests, his rigid structuralist
 Although less concerned with "knowledge", Coon commented on how scientists' conferences moved from a standard 'paradigm' and applied and conducted 'general science' only in a state of conflicting inconsistencies, which his work Raises questions on the critical framework of
 marks or sanrachnawad kaa sammishran kar ek anya francisi vichaarak lui althuger ne sanrachanaatmak saamaajik vishleshan ke apane nijee brands ko parichit karaayaa or sanrachanaatmak marxvad" ko vistaar diya
 tab se france or videshon main anya lekhakon ne sanrachanaatmak vishleshan ko har vyavastha main vyaavhaarik rup se vistaarit kiya
 As a result of its popularity, the definition of 'structuralism' also shifted
 ek andolan ke rup main apni lokapriyata ke vistrut hone or fike pad jane ke baad kuch lekhakon ne keval baad main is label kaa tyaag karne ke liye apane ko 'sanrachnawadi' mana
 The meaning of this word is somewhat different in French and English
 udhaaharan ke liye america main darida ko uttar sanrachnawad kaa pratimaan mana gaya he jabaki france main use sanrachnawadi chihnit kiya gaya he
 Finally, some authors wrote in many different genres
 For example, Barthes wrote some books that are clearly structuralist and others are clearly not
 aaj sanrachnawad, uttar-sanrachnawad or dikanshatruction jaise drushtikonon kii tulana main kam lokapriy he
 There are many reasons for this
 aksar, sanrachnawad kii aalochana anaitihaasik hone tathaa vyaktigat kshamta se kaary karne kii apeksha niyatatmak sanrachanaatmak balon kaa paksh lene ke liye kii gai he
 The political movement of the 1960s and 1970s began to affect education, with issues of power and political struggle taking center stage
 ethnologist robert julin ne ek alag ethnolagical vidhi ko paribhaashit kiya jisane spasht rup se sanrachnawad ke khilaaf apane ko daagdar banaaya
 In the 1980s, deconstruction and its influence on the basic ambiguity of language — rather than its transparent logical structure — became more popular
 sadi ke ant tak sanrachnawad ko vichaaron ke ek mahatvapurn aitihaasik sampradaay ke rup main dekha jane laga lekin yah khud sanrachnawad kii jagah, iske dwaara armbh kiye janevaale andolan the, jinhone dhyaan aakarshith kiya tha

 Five years later, the war which broke out against the enemies of the country, he repeatedly defeated the armies of Austria
 sheeghra hi usne british jahaajon kii sahaayta se saleni jeet lee jahaan use dictator ghoshit kiya gaya
 Garibaldi was repeatedly defeated by the forces of Naples, and with the triumph of triumph he also entered Naples, where Emenuel was distinguished and he himself began to destroy the remaining army of the French
 italy main jo nai sarkaar bani uskaa vidhaataa kavur tha
 Kavoor and his government's disinterest and indifference to his soldiers made Garibaldi irritated by him
 sheeghra hi rome par usne chadhaai kii par vah kaid kar liya gaya, yadhyapi us kaid se uskaa tatkaal chhutkaaraa ho gaya

 Garibaldi now prepared to finish Rome, which was not yet the authority of the Italian people

 Sikhs believe in a single God, whom they call one-onkar
 unka maananaa he ki ishwar akaal or nirankaar he
 The Sikh Panth has a sacred and unique place in India, the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev is the originator of Sikhism
 unhone apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue 
 He founded Sikhism on the firm foundation of love, service, hard work, philanthropy and brotherhood
 tajjub nahin ki ek udaaravaadi drushtikon se gurunanak dev ne sabhi dharmon kii achchhaayiyon ko samahit kiya
 His main precept was that God is one, He created all
 hindu musalmaan sabhi ek hi ishwar kii santan hai or ishwar ke liye sabhi samaan hai
 He has also told that God is true and man should do good deeds so that he does not have to be ashamed in the court of God
 gurunanak ne apane ek sabad main kaha he ki pandit pothee padhate hai, kintu vichaar ko nahin boojhte
 Teaches others, this makes their business of Maya
 unki kathani juthi he, ve sansar main bhatakate rahete hai
 They have no idea of the essence of couplet
 ye pandit to vaad-vivaad main hi pade rahete hai
 Guru Arjun Dev even goes so far as to say that God is pervasive like fire is absorbed in all vegetation and ghee is absorbed in milk
 isi tarah paramatma kii jyoti oonch-neech sabhi main vyaapt he paramatma ghat-ghat main vyaapt he- To make Sikhism strong and Maryadasampada, Guru arjun-dev did a huge historical and eternal work by editing the Adi Granth
 unhone aadi granth main paanch sikh guruon ke saath 15 santon evam 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko bhi sasamman shaamil kiya
 The names of these five gurus are - Guru Nanak, Guru Angaddev, Guru Amardas, Guru Ramdas and Guru Arjun Dev
 sheikh farid, jayadev, trilochan, sadhana, namdev, veni, ramanand, kabir, ravidaas, peepa, saitha, dhanna, bheekhan, parmanand or surdaas 15 santon kii vaani ko aadigranth main sangrahit karke guruji ne apni udaar maanavtaavaadi drushti kaa parichay diya
 Not only this, he ranked the compositions of 14 creators like Haribans, Balha, Mathura, Gaynd, Nalh, Bhalla, Salh Bhikkha, Kirat, Bhai Mardana, Sundardas, Rai Balwand and Satta Doom, Kalsahar, Jalap and gave them a high status
 did
 yah adbhut kaary karte samay guru arjuna dev ke saamne dharm jati, kshetra or bhashaa kii kisi seemaa ne avrodh paidaa nahin kiya
 He knew that all these gurus, saints and poets have the same cultural, ideological and thinking base
 ullekhneey he ki guru arjunadev ne jab aadigranth kaa sampaadan-kaary 1604 i
 main purna kiya tha tab usamen pehle paanch guruon kii vaniyan thim
 After this Guru Gobind Singh finalized the Adigranth by incorporating the voice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur
 aadi-granth main 15 santon ke kul 778 pad hai
 Of these 541 are from Kabir, 122 from Sheikh Farid, 60 from Namdev and 40 from Sant Ravidas
 anya santon ke ek se chaar padon kaa aadi granth main sthaan diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that these compositions stored in Adi Granth are completely safe without any change for more than 400 years
 lekin apane dehavsaan ke purv guru govind singh ne sabhi sikhon ke aadhyatmik maargdarshan ke liye guru granth sahab or unke sansaarik disha-nirdesan ke liye samooche khalsa panth ko ‘guru pad’ par asin kar diya
 At that time Adigranth came to be accepted as Guru Sahib
 sikh dharm ko kaaljayi banane ke liye guru govind singh ne sabhi dharmon or jatiyon ke logon ko guru-shishy-parampara main dikshit kiya
 He created this new human being for centuries to come
 yah nayaa manushya jatiyon evam dharmon main vibhakt na hokar dharm, maanav evam desh ke sangrakshan ke liye sadaiv katibaddh rahane vaala he
 This structure of taking everyone along is, no doubt, the Sikh psyche
 phir, sikh dharm kaa param lakshya maanav-kalyaan hi to he
 Perhaps to teach the lesson of this human welfare, Guru Govind Singh wrote a long letter to Aurangzeb, which mentions the praise of God as well as the poignant mention of injustice and atrocities that took place during Aurangzeb's reign
 is patr main nek karm karne or maasoom praja kaa khun na bahaane kii naseehaten, dharm evam ishwar kii aad main makkaari or jhooth ke liye chetavanee tathaa yoddha kii tarah maidan jang main aakar yuddh karne ke liye lalkaar he
 It is said that Aurangzeb's rage arose after reading this letter and after that he did not live long
 guru ji se ek baar bhent karne kii uski andaruni ichha bhi puri na ho saki
 It is not a credit to be given that the values on which the simple, simple, simple and natural life of the Sikh Gurus was based, they had certainly adopted those values from the traditional Indian consciousness
 desh, kaal or paristhitiyon kii maang ke anusaar unhone apane vyaktitv ko dhalkar tatkaaleen rajnatik, saamaajik, dharmik, aarthik evam saanskrithik jivan ko gahare main prabhavit kiya tha
 Sikh Gurus influenced the religion and social order of their time
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko ek nai disha di
 He removed devotion, knowledge, worship, spirituality and philosophy from a narrow circle and brought the society among those who were completely deprived of it
 isse logon kaa aatmbodh jaagaa or unamem ek nai drushti evam jagriti panpi, ve swanubhoot anubhav ko manyata dene lage
 In this way the flow of the formless ultimate power was intensified and quickly received
 sikh dharm kii ek anya marke kii vishistataa yah he ki sikh guruon ne manushya ko udhyam karte hue jivan jeene, kamaate hue sukh praapt karne or dhyaan karte hue prabhu kii prapti karne kii baat kahi
 He believed that a person who works hard remains free from all worries
 guru nanak ne to yahan tak kaha he ki jo vyakti mehnat karke kamata he or usamen kuch daan-punya karata he, vahi sahi maarg ko pahachaanata he
 The 'langar' system introduced by Sikh Gurus is an example not found elsewhere in cosmopolitanism, human love, equality and generosity
 sikh guruon ne kabhi na murajhaane vaale saanskrithik evam naitik mulyon kii bhi sthapana kii
 He had foreseen with his philosophical and spiritual thinking what the time would be like
 isliye unhone andhi nakal ke khilaaf vaikalpik chintan par jor diya
 Physical practice and humor is considered to be an essential part of life
 punjab ke lokgeeton, lokanrutyon evam hola mahallaa par shastradhariyon ke pradarshit kartabon ke mul main sikh guruon ke prerana-beej hi hai
 The roots of these folk songs and folk dances erupt from the soil of Punjab and cause panic among the people
 bhangada or giddha punjab kii saanskrithik shaan hai, jisaki dhadkan desh-videsh main praaia: suni jaati he
 Punjabi culture is the backbone of nationality
 iske praan main ekatv he, iske rakt main sahanubhuti, sahyog, karunaa or maanav-prem he
 Punjabi culture connects man and builds his identity
 vishwa ke kisi kone main ghumta-phirata punjabi swayan main se ek laghu punjab kaa praturup he
 Every Sikh has his or her own independent consciousness, which has been seriously thinking about solving life-related problems in its own light
 sikh guruon kaa itihaas uthaakar dekh lijie, unhone samrajyavaadee avadharana katai nahin banaai, ulte saanskriti, k dharmik evam aadhyatmik saamanjasy ke madhyam se maanavtaavaadi sansar kii drushti hi karte rahe
 The people of this earth have maintained their peaceful existence in spite of the period of indo-pak partition before independence and several decades after the violent violence and persecution in Punjab
 kaundh inkaa maargdarshan karti rahi he
 Sikhs have ten gurus
 shri guru granth sahib ji sikhon kaa dharmik granth he
 Sikhism begins with "one"
 sikhon ke dharm granth main "ek" kii hi vyakhya hai
 One is known by the names of Nirankara, Parbrahma etc
 nirankaar kaa swaroop shri gurugranth sahib ke shuruyaat main bataaya he jisko aam bhashaa main 'mul mantra' kehete hai
 Almost all religions worship this "one", but the various stages of "one" are mentioned and explained in Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji is unique in itself
 jeev aatma jo niraakaar he, us ke paas nirankaar ke sirf 4 hi gun vyaapt he As soon as the other four qualities are attained, the living soul goes back to Nirankar, but in order to attain it, it is necessary for the living soul to understand itself through the knowledge of Gurmat
 ise sikh dharm main "aatam chintan" kaha jaataa he
 The formless form of the soul is known in the basic Sikhs of Sikhism
 in kii gatividhion ko samaj kar insaan khud ko samaj saktaa he
 Sikhism begins with soul knowledge
 aatma kya he? kaha se ai he? vajood kyon he? karnaa kya he itihaadi ruhaniyat ke vishe sikh prachaar dwaara padhaaye jate hai
 What are the disorders of the soul, how should the disorder be free aatma swayam nirankaar kii ansh he
 Gets knowledge of nirankara by making it known
 sikhmat carmik falsafe main yakeen nahin rakhata
 Other religions say that God likes good deeds and God does very bad things with those who are bad
 lekin sikh dharm ke anusaar insaan khud kuch kar hi nahin saktaa
 a human being is limited to thinking only, that is what is in the "order", whether it is donating to a poor person or if he is killing someone
 yahi baat shri gurugranth sahib ji ke shuru main hi drudh karvaa di thi : That is why sin is not accepted in Gurmat
 agar insaan koi kriya karata he to wo antar aatma ke saath awaz mila kar kare
 It is Karna that Gurmat is against Karma scandal
 shri guru nanak dev ji ne apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue jan-saadhaaran ko dharm ke thekedaaron, pandon, piron aadi ke changul se mukt karne kii koshish kii
 It is mandatory for the following four 'substances' to be received by humans in their lifetime: dharm, arth, kaam, moksh ko chaar padaarthon main nahin liya gaya
 Mr
 Guru Gobind Singh Ji says: sikhamat main bhakton evam satguron ne nirankaar ko akar rahit kaha he
 Because earthly substances are finished one day but Parabrahma never dies
 isi liye use akaal kaha gaya he
 Not only this, the living soul is also devoid of form and is tied with this body for some time
 iskaa vajood sharir ke bagaiyr bhi he, jo aam manushya kii budhi se dur he
 It is Karna that Sikhism is strongly against idol worship
 satguruon evam bhakton ne murti pujakon ko andha, jaanavar itiyadi shabdon se niwaja he
 His picture cannot be made
 yahi nahin koi bhi sansari padaarth jaise kii kabar, bhakton evam satguruon ke itihaasak padaarth, pratimaayein adik ko poojana sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 Knowledge of religious texts is a method that leads to the country of Nirankar, before which the Sikhs bow down, but the worship of religious texts is also against the basic principles of Sikhs
 sikhamat main har jeev ko avatar kaha gaya he
 Every living being is part of that nirankar
 sansar main koi bhi panchi, pashu, ped, itiyadi avatar hai
 In the cunt of Manush, the creature has descended to complete his knowledge
 vyakti kii puja sikh dharm main nahin he "maanukh ki tech birthi sab jaanat, dene, ko eke bhagwaan"
 All avatars do not come full on the condition of a nirankar
 yahi kaaran he kii sikh kisi ko paramatior ke rup main nahin maanate
 Yes, if an avatar preaches Gurmat then Sikhs are definitely associated with that sermon
 jaisaa kii krishna ne gita main kaha he kii aatma marati nahin or jeev hatya kuch nahin hoti, is baat se to sikhamat sahamat he lekin aage krishna ne kaha he kii karm hi dharm he jis se sikh dharm sahamat nahin
 Prophet is one who spread the message or knowledge of Nirankar in the common folk
 jaisaa kii islam main kaha he kii mohammad aakhri paigambar he sikhon main kaha gaya he ki "har jug jug bhakt upaaya"
 Devotees are born equal and spread the message of Nirankar to the people
 sikhamat "laa elaha ill allaah " se sahamat he lekin sirf mohammad hi rasul allaah he is baat se sahamat nahin
 Arjun Dev ji says "dhur ki baani aayi, tein sagli chinta mittai", meaning that i have uttered a voice and my real concerns have disappeared that i have found it in whose eyes i was sitting
 mul rup main bhakton avam satguruon kii vaani kaa sangreh jo satguru arjuna dev ji ne kiya tha jise aadi granth kaha jaataa he sikhon ke dharmik granth ke rup main prasiddh he | yah granth 36 bhakton kaa sachaa upadesh he or ascharyajanak baat ye he kii 36 bhakton ne nirankaar ko sam drushti main vyaakhyaan kiya he | kisi shabd main koi bhinnata nahin he | sikh aadi granth ke saath saath dasam granth, jo kii satguru gobind singh ji kii vaani kaa sangreh he ko bhi maanate hai | yah granth khalse ke adheen he | par mul rup main aadi granth kaa gyaan lenaa hi sikhon ke liye sarvopriya he | Not only this, the Sikhs respect every scripture in which Gurmat is preached
 aadi granth yaa aadi guru granth yaa guru granth sahib yaa aadi guru darbar yaa pothee sahib, guru arjuna dev dawaara sangrihith ek dharmik granth he jisame 36 bhakton ke atmik jivan ke anubhav darj hai | aadi granth is liye kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen "aadi" kaa gyaan bharpoor he | jap bani ke mutabik "sach" hi aadi he | iskaa gyaan karwaane vaale granth ko aadi granth kehete hai | iske hawaale swayam aadi granth ke bheetar hai | halaaki vidwan tabaka kahata he kyonki ye granth main guru teg bahadur ji kii bani nahin thi is liye yah aadi granth he or satguru gobind singh ji ne 9wein mahale kii bani chadhaai is liye is aadi granth kii jaganh guru granth kaha jane laga | Satguru Arjun Dev ji was present in the form of speech books of devotees and Satgurus
 Bhai Gurdas Ji wrote this book and Satguru Arjun Dev became the guide
 He also recorded his speech in the book
 Many copies of this book were also prepared
 aadi granth ke 1430 panne khalsa dawaara maanakit kiye gaye | The Dasam Granth is a Sikh scripture which is a collection of the sacred words and compositions of Satgur Gobind Singh Ji
 guru gobind singh ji ne apane jeevankaal main anek rachanaayen kii jinaki choti choti pothiyaan bana deen
 After his death, on the orders of his religious wife Mata Sundari, Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa and other Khalsa brothers collected all the works of Guru Gobind Singh ji and put it in a book which is today called "dasam Granth"
 sidhe shabdon main kaha jaye to guru gobind singh ji ne rachana kii or khalse ne sampadanaa kii
 The entire Sikh community is entertained by the Dasam Granth
 dasam granth kii vaaniyaan jaise kii jaap sahib, tav parasaad savaiye or chopai sahib sikhon ke rojaanaa sajadaa, nitnem, kaa hissaa he or yah vaaniyaan khande bate kii pahole, jis ko aam bhashaa main amrit chakna kehete hai, ko banaate vakt padhi jaati hai
 In the gurudwaras of Takhat Hazur Sahib, Takhat Patna Sahib and Nihang Singh, the Dasam Granth is lighted with Guru Granth Sahib and is also taken daily
 sarbloh granth ore bhai gurdas kii vaaren shankaa grast rachanaae hai | halaaki khalsa mahima sarbloh granth main susajit he jo satguru gobind singh kii pramanit rachana he, baaki srbloh granth main karm cond, vyakti puja itiyadi vishe mojood hai jo sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf hai | bhai gurdas kii vaaron main murti puja, karm sidhaant adik gurmat viruddh shabd darj hai No historical source is considered complete for the history of Sikhism
 Sri Guru Sobha has assumed such a book which has been written by a Sikh near Gobind Singh but dates are not given in it
 There are other historical texts of Sikhs such as Shri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth, Gurbilas Patshahi 10, Shri Gur Sobha, Manhima Prakash and Panth Prakash, Janamsakhiya Itiyadi
 Sri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth is explained in Gurdwaras
 Once Gurbilas Patshahi was 10
 Most of the history has been written after 1750
 The scholars who wrote history were mostly Sanatani, due to which, in some historical books, Satguru and devotees have shown miraculous, which according to Gurmat philosophy is not right
 Guru Nanak flying in the air, riding a crocodile, Baba Budha's oblation of Mata Ganga is embodied in the historical events of Jamsakhis and Gurbilas and later historians have written these things by putting a spice on them
 No Satgur and devotee wrote their world history
 Satguru Gobind Singh has also written as much as he has written briefly and bluntly
 Sikhism does not give much importance to history, which is useful for understanding Sikhism as much as it is useful for Sikhism
 aaj sikh itihaas kaa shuddhikaran karne main lage hai
 And with the help of ancient texts, writing history keeping Gurmat in mind

 Embossed and deep fine lines are seen in the hands and feet of human beings
 ye hal chalaae khet kii bhanti dikhti hai
 Although those lines are so subtle that they usually do not even get noticed, but their special study has given rise to a science called finger-print-science
 is vigyaan main anguliyon ke upree poron kii unnat rekhaon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 As a result of the analysis done on the basis of some common symptoms, the shapes formed from these are considered four types: conch, chakra, arc and compound
 aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki anguli-chhap-vigyaan kaa janm atyant pracheen kaal main asia main hua
 The Indian ocean has considered the above conch, chakra and champs in future calculations
 do hajaar varsh se bhi pehle china main anguli-chhaapon kaa prayog vyakti kii pahchaan ke liye hota tha
 But we can assume the birth of modern fingerprint science from 1823 AD, when Mr
 Barkinje, Professor at Bresla University, accepted the stability of the finger lines

 In 1892, the famous English scientist Sir Francis Galton published a book on fingerprints in which he expressed gratitude for the help given by the sub-registrar of Hooghly, Sri Ramgati Bandyopadhyay
 unhone anguli rekhaon kaa sthayitv siddh karte hue anguli chhaapon ke vargeekaran tathaa unka abhilekh rakhane kii ek pranali banaai jisase sandigdh vyakti kii thik se pahchaan ho sake
 But this system was somewhat difficult

 The real credit for this is to Mr

 is pranali kii achookta dekhakar bharat sarkaar ne 1897 i
 main anguli chhaapon dwaara purv dandit vyaktiyon kii pahchaan ke liye vishwa kaa pratham anguli-chhap-karyaalay kalakatta main sthapit kiya
 Identification by fingerprint is dependent on two principles, one is that the fingerprints of two persons can never be the same and the other is that fingerprints of individuals do not change throughout life but also after life
 at: kisi bhi vichaarneey anguli chhap ko kisi vyakti kii anguli chhap se tulana karke yah nishchit kiya ja saktaa he ki vichaarneey anguli chhap uski he yaa nahin
 How difficult it is to identify individuals in the absence of fingerprint will become clear from the practice of the famous Bhawal Saints
 rekhaon kaa dhyaan se nirikshan karne par unamem nijee visheshtaayen rekhaanton tathaa dwishakhaon ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 Fingerprinting is particularly useful for three tasks, namely: anek apradhi aise hote hai jo swechha se apni anguli chhap nahin dena chaahate
 Therefore, the Indian Police has been given the right to take fingerprints of prisoners by the Prison Identification Act
 bharat ke prayek rajya main ek sarkari anguli-chhap-karyaalay he jisamen dandit vyaktiyon kii anguli chhaapon ke abhilekh rakhe jate hai tathaa apekshit tulana ke uparaant aavashyak soochna di jaati he
 There are about three lakh such records in the Uttar Pradesh office of Allahabad
 1956 i
 main kalakatta main ek kendriya anguli-chhap-karyaalay kii bhi sthapana kii gai he
 Apart from these, there are many experts who do their business of providing services in disputed cases of fingerprints
 anguli chhaapon kaa prayog police vibhaag tak hi simit nahin he, apitu anek saarvajanik kaaryon main yah achook pahchaan ke liye upyogi siddh hua he
 In order to prevent the exchange of newborns, the designation of boys and fingerprints of their mothers is taken at the beginning in foreign hospitals

 In the US, this practice has been practiced even to the common people

 The movement for the creation of the Jan Lokpal Bill began in its all-india form on 5 April 2011 with a hunger strike by social activist Anna Hazare and his comrades at Jantar Mantar, including Magsaysay Award winner Arvind Kejriwal, India's first woman Administrative officer Kiran Bedi, famous folkloric lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev, founder of Patanjali Yogpeeth were included
 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of the Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand
 kintu manmohan singh ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen sarkaar ne iske prati nakaaratmak ravaiya dikhaaya or isaki upeksha kii
 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected
 kintu is anshan ke andolan kaa rup lene par bharat sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main ek samiti banaakar sambhavit khatre ko taala or 16 agast tak sansad main lokapal vidheyak paas karaane kii baat sweekaar kar lee
 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 The government stuck many obstacles in its path and arrested Anna Hazare and his associates on 16 August
 kintu isse andolan pure desh main bhadak uthaa
 a large number of dharnas, demonstrations and fasts were organized continuously for the next 12 hearts across the country
 antat sansad dwaara anna kii teen sharton par sahamati kaa prastaav paas karne ke baad 28 agast ko anna ne apana anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna Hazare started a fast unto death on 5 April 2011 in protest against government inaction demanding the creation of a strong Lokpal Bill
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unki is muhim main arvind kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, baba ramdev evam anya anek prasiddh samajasevi shaamil the
 The government continued to neglect it
 is anshan ko bharat evam sheeghra hi vishwa ke sanchaar madhyamon main vistrut rup se prakashit or prasaarit kiya jane laga
 This ongoing effort against corruption soon got widespread public support
 bharat ke praayah sabhi shaharon main yuva sadakon par utar aae evam iske samarthan main pradarshan kiya tathaa parche baante
 Concerned over the spread of Anna Hazare's fast as a nationwide mass movement, the government immediately announced a committee to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill
 usne 16 agast se pehle sansad main ek majboot lokapal vidheyak paas karaane par bhi sahmati prakat kar di
 In this way, this fast came to an end and the mass movement that flourished against corruption ended with the hope of building a strong Lokpal
 kintu sarkari manshaa sandigdh thi isliye anna hajaare ne saath hi ghoshnaa kii ki yadi aagaamee 15 agast tak apekshit lokapal vidheyak nirmit nahin hua to ve 16 agast se punah anshan par jaayenge
 The government announced the creation of a 10-member Lokpal draft construction committee, in accordance with the terms of the cessation of Anna Hazare's fast in April
 isamen sarkaar ke 5 evam naagarik samaaj ke 5 pratinidhi rakhe gaye
 Anna Hazare accepted a minister to be the chairman of the committee, not opposing the logic of compulsion of the constitutional provisions of the government
 kintu kapil sibbal ke netritv vaali is samiti ke mantriyon ne apni manamaani kii
 There was opposition between the civil society representatives and the government over the issue of bringing the Prime Minister and judges under the Lokpal
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bhavishya main kaanoon banane ke liye naagarik samaaj kii raay nahin lee jaaegi
 Finally, the ministers refused to accept all the important suggestions of the Jan Lokpal presented by Anna Hazare
 dikhaave ke liye jan lokapal ke ve sabhi bindu maan liye gaye jo sarkari mantriyon or saansadon, evam nyayadhishon ko lokapal kii pahunch se baahar rakhte the
 Finally disappointed with the attitude of government ministers, Anna Hazare's colleagues drafted the Jan Lokpal draft separately
 or is tarah samiti ne do masaude kaa nirmaan kiya jise kendriya mantrimandal ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 There too, the draft of the ministers was fully presented but the summary of the Jan Lokpal was kept
 or apeksha ke anuroop mantrimandal ne mantriyon ke masaude ko apanaakar sansad main pesh karne ke liye sahmati de di
 On 4 August 2011, the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 According to a custom, Allah’s Rasul has said that "I am the best speaking Arab, so i was born in Quraysh and grew up in Saad"
 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia

 Political science is a social science which deals with the study of government and politics

 Political science includes all these things: political thought, political theory, political philosophy, political ideology, institutional or structural framework, comparative politics, public administration, international law and organization etc

 The Greek thinker Aristotle is called the father of political science
 unani chintan main plato kaa adarshavaad evam arestu kaa buddhivaad samahit he
 Political science or political science is a very ancient subject
 prarambh main ise swatantra vishay ke rup main nahin sweekaara gaya
 There was a tradition of studying political science based on the concepts of ethics, philosophy, history, and jurisprudence etc
 aadhunik samay main ise na keval swatantra vishay ke rup main sweekaara gaya apitu saamaajik vigyaanon ke sandarbhon main iskaa paryaapt vikaas bhi hua
 While studying political science is more important in today's context than before, on the other hand it is also very complex
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa mahatv is tathy se prakat hota he ki aaj raajnneetik prakriya kaa adhyayan rashtriya evam anterrashtriya-donon prakaar kii raajnneeti ko samajhane ke liye aavashyak he
 Knowledge of real politics and facts located within them is possible only through the study of the process
 raajnneeti vigyaan kii jatilta unke ativyapee rup va unase utpann swaroop evam prakruti se judi hui he
 Today political science deals with both 'political' and non-political elements
 raajnneetik tatv pratyaksh rup se raajnneetik prakriya ko sanchalit karte he or is drushti se raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat rajya sarkaar, sarkari sansthaaon, chunaav pranali va raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Non-political elements indirectly contribute to the running of the political process and for this reason a correct understanding of politics can only be achieved by coordinating them
 isi uddheshy se raajnneetik adhyayan main samaaj, arthvyavastha, dharm, samskruti, bhugol, vigyaan va takneekee, manovigyaan va itihaas jaise sahyogi tatwon ko paryaapt mahatv diya jaataa he
 Political science forms, study materials and its traditions have changed from time to time with contributions from various thinkers, theorists and analysts from the time of the Greek thinkers to the modern period
 tadnurup is vishay kaa nirantar vikaas hota rahaa hai
 In this development, two major approaches have emerged regarding the study of political science: the traditional approach and the modern approach
 parmparik yaa paramparaagat drushtikon rajya-pradhanta kaa parichay detaa he jabaki aadhunik drushtikon prakriya-pradhanta kaa
 The political approach that has been prevalent in the sixth century to the 20th century BCE, before the Second World War, is called 'traditional political approach' in terms of study facility
 ise adarshavaadi yaa shastreey drushtikon bhi kaha jaataa he
 Many political thinkers have contributed to the formulation and development of traditional political theory such as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Saint Augustine, Aquinas, Locke, Rousseau, Montescue, Kant, Heigl, Green, etc
 aadhunik yug main bhi anek vidwaan paramparaagat drushtikon ke samarthak maane jate he jaise- liyo strans, erik vogolin, oksot, hanna arent aadi
 In ancient Greece and Rome, the concepts of philosophy, ethics, logic, history and law were made the basis for the creation of political theory, but in the medieval period, mainly Christian theological perspectives were made the basis of political theory
 16veen sadi main punarjagran aandolan ne bauddhik raajnneetik chetana ko janm diya saath hi raashtra-rajya avadharana ko janm diya
 The Industrial Revolution of the 18th century gave a new impetus to the development of political theory
 england kii gauravpurn kranti, france va america kii loktantric krantiyon ne paramparaagat raajnneetik siddhanth kaa vikaas ’udaaravaadi loktantric raajnneetik siddhant’ ke rup main kiya
 The traditional political approach has adopted philosophical, logical, moral, historical and legal methods mainly for the formulation of political theory
 19veen sadi se isane vidhik, sanvaidhanik, sansthagat, vivarnaatmak evam tulanaatmak paddatiyon par vishesh bal diya he
 From the beginning of the 20th century, the traditional approach adopted a new vision for the formulation of political theory which was more realistic than in the past
 paramparaagat raajnneetik vigyaan main sarkaar evam uske vaidhanik angon ke baahar vyavhaar main sarkaar kii nitiyon evam nirnyon ko prabhavit karne vaale saamaajik raajnneetik tathyon ke adhyayan par bal diya
 The political party emphasized the study of formal organizations, along with the groups of evidences
 isane un saamaajik, aarthik paristhitiyon evam aandolanon ke adhyayan par bhi bal diya jo spashtatah sarkaar ke aupchaarik sanghathan se baahar to hote hai kintu uski nitiyon evam kaaryakramon ko prabhavit karte hai
 The synonym of 'politics' is the English word 'politics' from the Greek word 'polis' which means 'city' or 'state'
 pracheen yunaan main prayek nagar ek swatantra rajya ke rup main sangathit hota tha or politics shabd se un nagar rajyon se sambandhit shashan kii vidya kaa bodh hota tha
 Gradually, the city states were replaced by the national states, so politics also became a widely related discipline of the state
 aadhunik yug main jab sansar prayek vishay ke vaigyanik va vyavasthit adhyayan kii ore jhuk rahaa he, rajya se sambandhit vishyon kaa adhyayan raajnneeti shaastra athwa raajnneeti vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 Traditional political science scholars have given different definitions of political science
 in paribhaashaon kii nimnaankit sheershakon ke antargat vyakhya kii ja sakati haih- Political science is the study of the state - Many political scientists believe that since ancient times, political science is the subject of the study of an institution called the state
 vidwaanon kii manyata he ki pracheen kaal se aadhunik kaal tak raajnneeti vigyaan kaa ’kendriya tatv’ rajya hi rahaa he
 Therefore, the state should be studied only in political science
 prasiddh raajnneetishastri bluenshali ke anusaar raajnneeti shaastra vah vigyaan he jiskaa sambandh rajya se he or jo yah samajhane kaa praytn karata he ki rajya ke aadharbhoot tatv kya he, uskaa aavashyak swaroop kya he, uski kin-kin vividh roopon main abhivyakti hoti he tathaa uskaa vikaas kaise hua
 The German writer Garris states that in political science, as an institution of power, all the relations of the state, its origin, its tangible form, its purpose, its moral importance, its economic problems, its stages of existence, its financial aspects, The purpose is considered
 doctor garnor ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti shaastra kaa prarambh tathaa ant rajya ke saath hota he
 "dr
 Zakaria states that" Political science systematically represents the basic principles according to which the organization of the state in the macro form and sovereignty is exercised
 ’ It is clear from all the above definitions that the central subject of political science is the state
 iskaa kaaran plato va arestu ke samay se chali aa rahi yah manyata he ki rajya kaa astitv kuch pavitra lakshyon kii prapti ke liye he
 Political science is the study of government - in the opinion of some political scientists, government should be studied in political science, not the state
 unka mat he ki rajya manushyon kaa hi sanghathan vishesh he tathaa uski kriyaatmak abhivyakti sarkaar ke madhyam se hoti he
 He argues that the state is an intangible structure while the government is a tangible and direct institution and the government exercises sovereignty
 sarkaar hi rajya kaa vah yantra hota he jiske dwaara uske uddeshy tathaa prayojan kaaryrup main parinit hote hai
 Therefore, government should study only in political science
 seale ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan shashan ke tatwon kaa anusandhan usee prakaar karata he jaise sampatti shaastra sampatti kaa, jeevigyaan jivan kaa, ankaganit ankon kaa tathaa rekhganit sthaan evam lambaai-chaudaai kaa karata he
 "leacock has given a concise and concise definition in this context -" Political science is the scripture related to government
 ’’ Political science is the study of both the state and the government - some scholars of traditional political science believe that the definitions given from the point of view of the state or government alone are incomplete
 vastutah rajya evam sarkaar kaa paraspar ghanishtha sambandh he or inamen se kisi ek ke abhaav main duusare kaa adhyayan hi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 If the state is an intangible structure, then the government gives it a tangible and physical form and similarly if the state is to hold sovereignty then the government consumes that sovereignty
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat in donon kaa hi adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 According to Paul Janet, "political science is that part of social sciences in which the basis of the state and the principles of government are considered
 ’’ dymock ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan kaa sambandh rajya tathaa uske saadhan sarkaar se he
 While giving a short definition, Gilchrist has said that "political science studies the common problems of the state and the government
" ’’ Political science is the study in terms of the human element - some political scientists do not consider the above definitions to be absolute because the human element is ignored in these definitions
 inaki manyata he ki rajya yaa sarkaar kaa adhyayan bina maanav ke uddeshyheen evam mahatvaheen he kyonki inkaa nirmaan maanav ke hit ke liye hi hua he atah maanav-tatv kaa adhyayan anivaary he
 According to Professor Laski, "the study of political science is related to the life of human beings belonging to organized states
" ’’ raajnneeti shaastra ke prasang main maanav tatv kaa mahatv vyakt karte huye encychlopedia of soshal sinsej main harman hiler ne to yahan tak kaha he ki ’’raajnneeti shaastra ke sarvangin swaroop kaa nirdhaaran uski manushya vishyak moulik manyataon dwaara hota he
 "it literally means that political science is such a social science under which the fact is also studied what is the position of man himself in an organized political society
 raajnneeti vigyaan vyakti ke adhikaar va swatantrataaon ke adhyayan ke saath samaaj ke vibhinn samudaayon va virgon ke prati sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 Therefore, we can define political science as a scripture which is related to the organization called its state and which includes a detailed study of government by nature, in short, under political science the state, government and other related organizations and institutions Ka is studied in the context of human political life
 raajnneeti vigyaan se sambandhit paramparaagat paribhaashayen nimna pravritiyaan ingit karti he- Just as political science has been defined by different thinkers in different ways, different fields have been expressed by different authors in different words
 udaahranarth francisi vichaarak bluenshali ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan kaa sambandh rajya ke aadhaaron se he vah uski aavashyak prakruti, uske vividh roopon, uski abhivyakti tathaa uske vikaas kaa adhyayan karata he
 "according to Dr
 Garner," its fundamental problems usually include the research of the origin and nature of the first state, the progress of the second political institutions, the study of its history and its forms, and the third, as far as possible, on the basis of political And determining the rules of development
 gaetel ne raajnneeti shaastra ke kshetra kaa vistrut varnan kartehuye likhaa he ki ‘‘aitihaasik drushti se raajnneeti shaastra rajya kii utpatti, raajnneetik sansthaaon ke vikaas tathaa ateet ke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karata he
 


 In studying the present, it tries to describe, compare and classify the existing political institutions and ideologies
 parivartansheel paristhitiyon tathaa naitik maapdandon ke aadhaar par raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa kriyakalapon ko adhik unnat banane ke uddheshy se raajnneeti shaastra bhavishya kii ore bhi dekhtaa hua yah bhi vichaar karata he ki rajya kaisaa hona chaiye
 '' raajnneeti shaastra ke kshetra ke vishay main uparokt paribhaashaon se teen vichaardhaaraen saamne aati he- To determine the field of traditional political science, UNESCO organized a conference of leading political scientists of the world in September 1948, in which it was decided to include the following study topics under the field of traditional political science- raajnneeti ke siddhanth- ateet or vartmaan ke raajnneetik siddhanton evam vichaaron kaa adhyayan
 Political Institutions - Simple and comparative study of constitution, national government, territorial and local governance
 raajnneetik dal, samooh evam lokmat- raajnneetik dal evam dabaab samoohon kaa raajnneetik vyavhaar, lokmat tathaa shashan main nagarikon ke bhaag lene kii prakriya kaa adhyayan

 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan darshan evam kalpana par aadhaarit he
 Traditionalist thinkers have mostly been influenced by philosophy
 in vichaarkon ne maanviya jivan ke mulyon par dhyaan diya hai
 Their system of thinking is deductive
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan main plato kaa vishesh mahatv he
 In addition to Plato, the thought of the Roman thinker Cicero and Saint Augustine in the medieval period gives a clear glimpse of traditional political science
 aadhunik yug main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke prabal samarthako kii kaaphi sankhya he
 The compositions of Russo, Kant, Hegel, Green, Bossanke, Laski, Oakshott and Leostras have a clear glimpse into Plato's ideas
 aadhunik kaal main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kii adhyayan saamagree evam rajya sambandhi dharanon kii katu aalochana hui he
 According to critics, some processes and an environment are seen beyond the periphery of the state and political institutions, neglecting the study of which is disastrous for the dignity and utility of political science
 is mat ke prativadak yah maanate he ki sabhi samaaj vigyaanon kii prerana strot va adhyayan kaa kendra bindu maanav-vyavhaar he or raajnneeti vigyaan saamanytah maanav vyavhaar ke raajnneetik pahalu kaa adhyayan he
 Prior to the Second World War, certain political thinkers were insistent on giving a major place to the political processes and activities of human beings in the study of political science
 balter vaijahot, woodro wilson, lard brice aadi ne raajnneeti ke yathartwaadee adhyayan par bal diya
 Graham Wallas, Arthur Bentley, Caitlin and Lasvalle emphasized the study of humans and their behavior
 charles marium ne 1925 kii amareeki raajnneeti vigyaan eshosiation ke sammelan main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye vaigyanik takneekon evam pravidhiyon ke vikaas evam prayog par bal diya
 In 1930 Laswell, in his book psycho-pathology and Politics, laid the foundation for Fried's psychology to explain political events and actions
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke purv america kaa chicago vishvavidhyalay vyavahaaravaadi raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kaaryakshetra ban chukaa tha
 The development of the Second World War has special significance in the development process from traditional political science to modern political science, after which the world was very different from the former world in terms of political structure, industrial development, scientific and technological achievements and military capability
 vishwastar par huye is gambhir parivartan ne maanav samaaj va samskruti kii paramparaagat avadharanaon ke sthaan par nai avadharanaon ko janm diya
 In this environment after the Second World War, Charles Mariam fully supported the use of new and scientific techniques for the study of political science in his work 'new Aspect of Politics'
 uparokt prishthbhumi main 1960 ke dashak main america ke chicago vishvavidhyalay ke raajnneetishastriyon ne raajnneeti vigyaan ko darshanik paddati se mukt karne evam uske adhyayan ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane kaa praytn kiya
 It is considered appropriate to adopt the scientific methods of social sciences such as sociology, psychology, economics, anthropology, to make political science a social science
 in vaigyanikon main david easton, ketalin, lasvail aadi pramukh he
 George Caitlin, David Easton, Harald Lasvall and Kaplan are particularly notable in terms of modern concepts of political science
 in vidwaanon ne raajnneeti vigyaan sambandhi apane kathyon main raajnneeti ke vaastavik evam vyaavhaarik sandarbhon par bal dete huye use shakti, prabhaav, raajnneetik auchity evam satta kaa adhyayan mana he
 The ideas about political science presented by political scientists who are advocates of the modern approach can be explained under the following points- raajnneeti vigyaan maanav kriyaaon kaa adhyayan he- raajnneeti vigyaan ke aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar evam kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Non-political factors also influence human behavior
 in sabhi karkon kaa raajnneeti vigyaan main adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 a
 Heard and S
 Huntington's statement that "political pragmatism accepts governance as a process of actions for humans and their communities
" hasjaar va stivension kaa yah vichaar he ki ’’raajnneeti vigyaan apane adhyayan kshetra main praathmik rup main vyaktiyon ke parsparik va samuhik tathaa rajya evam rajyon ke madhya prakat shakti sambandhon se sambandhit he
 Political science is the study of power - Caitlin and Lasvalle are supporters of this idea
 donon ke vivechan kaa mukhya aadhaar manovigyaan he
 In 1927–28, Caitlin emphasized the study of the political activity of man in place of state, describing politics as a struggle for dominance and control
 uske matanusaar sangharsh kaa mul strot maanav kii yah ichha rahi he ki duusare log uskaa astitv maane
 In 1962, Caitlin wrote in her book Systematic Politics - Political science is the most concerned about the work that is done due to the sense of control and the structure and desires that are created due to the desires of relationships based on the feeling of control
 anya shaktivaadee vichaarak lasvail kii manyata he ki samaaj main katipay mulyon va moolyawaan vyaktiyon kii prapti ke liye har vyakti apana prabhaav daalane kii cheshtaa karata hai tathaa prabhavacheshtaa main shakti bhav nihit rahata he
 Therefore, according to Laswell, 'politics is the politics that is intended to tell who gets what, what, when and how
 ' uske anusaar raajnneetik kriyalap kaa prarambh us paristhiti se hota he jisamen karta vibhinn mulyon kii prapti ke liye praytn karata he tathaa shakti jisaki aavashyak shart hoti he
 Political science is the study of the polities - the supporters of this view are David Easton, Amand, R
V
 Kegan etc
 yah drushtikon raajnneeti vigyaan ko samajashastreey drushtikon main paribhaashit karata hai
 They believe that the whole society is a system in itself and the state system is a sub-system of this entire social system and it forms an integral part of it
 rajya vyavastha main anek kriyasheel sanrachanaae hoti hai jaise samvidhan sarkaar ke ang, raajnneetik dal, dabaab samooh, lokmat evam nirvachan evam maanav-vyavvhaar is vyavastha kaa abhinn bhaag he
 In short, these scholars believe that political science studies the interactions and relations of these structures of the political system and the political behavior of human beings as part of the entire social system
 raajnneeti vigyaan rajvyavastha ke adhyayan ke antargat nimna tathyon par adhik bal detaa he -sampurna samaaj vyavastha ke ang ke rup main raajnneetik prakriya kaa adhyayan, vyavastha kisanrachana evam samoohon ke parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan
 Political science is the study of decision process - Political scientists who are supportive of this view believe that while studying government, political science also studies the decision-making process of government or science in the context of the prevailing conditions in society or state
 is kaaran raajnneeti vigyaan aisa vigyaan he jo kisi shashan kii niti-prakriya evam uske dwaara niti nirmaan kaa adhyayan karata he visheshkar in donon ko prabhavit karne vaale karkon ke sandarbh main, is drushtikon kii manyata he ki maanav prakruti ke sandarbh main sarkaar dwaara niti nirmaan-prakriya kaa kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 In real political life, the decision making in the name of governance is done by the individual himself and hence the decision making process has a wide influence on the decision makers personality, interest culture, religion, political ideology, mental level decision making power etc
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan manushya ke saamaajik raajnneetik jivan kaa adhyayan karata he
 Under this, along with political processes, political organizations are also studied
 pinok evam smith ke anusaar kya he tathaa kya hona chaiye or in donon ke bich yathasambhav samanvay kaise praapt kiya jaye, is drushti se ham sarkaar tathaa raajnneetik prakriya ke vyavasthit adhyayan ko raajnneeti vigyaan kehete he
 The field of political science is highly developed in the modern era
 shakti va prabhaav ke sandarbh main raajnneeti kii sarvavyaapaktaa ne use har taraf pahunchaa diya he or na keval saamaajik balki vyakgit jivan ke bhi lagbhag sabhi paksh raajnneetik vyavastha ke adheen he
 While the ubiquity of politics has proved the folk religion of political interpretations on the one hand, it has also created ambiguity and confusion regarding what is political
 iske baavjood raajnneetik vigyaan ke kshetra ko rajyapradhan va rajetar sandarbhon main bhaleebhanti samajha ja saktaa he
 In the state context, political concepts and concepts related to the state's concepts - socialism, democracy etc
, government or organization constitution described and actual behavior, mutual relations of government positions and institutions, organizational and experimental aspects of election, administrative and judiciary and interpretation of the state, Principles of origin, state functionality, state-wide ideologies Freedom, equality, rights etc
 rajettar sandarbh main raajnneeti kii prakriyaatmak vaastaviktaa, raajnneeti vyavastha ke vibhinn drushtikon, rajettar sansthaae jaise raajnneetik dal, dabaav va hit samooh, gaiyr rajya-prakriyaaye va unka vistaar, anterrashtriya raajnneetik vaastaviktaae tathaa jatiltaaye ityadi aati hai
 The principles and methods of representation can also be understood in this context
 raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan kshetra ke bare main aadhunik drushtikon kii kuch aadharbhoot manyataain hai jaise- adhyayan kshetra ke nirdhaaran main yatharthparak drushtikon apnaanaa, raajnneetik vigyaan kii vishay vastu ko antar-anushaasanamak drushtikon ke antargat samajha jaye, raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main vaigyanik paddati va upagamon ko prayog main laayaa jaye
 According to the modern view, the area of political science can be explained under the following points: maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan- aadhunik drushtikon maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar ke adhyayan par bal detaa he
 Although it affects the human behavior but also studies the non-political elements, it is recognized that to understand human behavior in real terms, the study of all the non-political feelings, beliefs and powers should be included which can affect the political behavior of human beings
 Affect vibhinn avadharanaon kaa adhyayan - aadhunik raajnneeti vigyaan mukhyatah shakti, prabhaav, satta, niyantran, nirnay prakriya aadi kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karata he
 According to this view, these are concepts whose political institutions work in the background only
 raajnneetishastri inhen avadharanaon ke pariprekshya main raajnneetik sansthaaon kaa adhyayan karte he
 For this reason, this type of study has been called informal study of the truth
 raajnneeti vigyaan samasyaon evam sangharshon kaa adhyayan - aadhunik raajnneetishastri yatha professor daayak evam peter orgard raajnneeti shaastra ko saarvajanik samasyaon va sangharshon kaa adhyayan kshetra main shaamil karte he
 In their opinion, tension and politics start due to problems of their distribution due to limited values and means
 vah raajnneetik dalon ke atirikt vibhinn vyaktiyon va samoohon main tak main fail jaati hai
 Professor Dyck called politics the politics of conflict of characters with conflicting desires over public problems
 peter origuard kii manyata he ki is sangharsh main raajnneeti ke alaava anya bahyatatvon kaa niyantran nahin hona chaiye
 Study of Public Consent and General Opinion - In the opinion of some scholars, political science is the study of consensus and general opinion on public problems
 unke vichaar main sangharsh sangharsh ke liye hi nahin varan saamaanya sahmati va saamaanya abhimath ko prabhavit karne ke liye hota he
 That is why Edward Weinfield has said that 'activities that make any issue conflict or resolve are part of all politics
 ’’ From the above analysis it is clear that despite the differences in the field of political science in the modern approach, there is agreement on some basics, such as everyone recognizes that the study area of political science is realistic, its study is inter-disciplinary
 Approach and scientific method should be used
 haalanki yah satya he ki aadhunik raajnneetishastriyon kaa raajnneeti vigyaan main vaigyanik pramanikta va sunishchitata kaa daawa abhi purna nahin hua he
 For this reason, Pinock and Smith, while accepting some modifications in the modern approach, have given a proper place in the study of political science, along with the study of practical politics, as well as the organizational and fundamental study of political institutions
 arastu ke anusaar manushya ek saamaajik praani he
 All the dimensions of social life fulfill his lifestyle
 maanak jivan kii dhuree par in ayaamon ke sabhi niamak vishay paraspar judakar satat parichaalit he
 Politics does the important work of coordinating all these dimensions
 raajnneeti vigyaan evam anya saamaajik vigyaanon kii ghanishthata ke kaaran hi raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main pracheen kaal se antar-anushaasanamak adhyayan kii parampara rahi he
 In the works of ancient Greek thinker Plato, Aristotle, the intimacy of politics is evident from philosophy and ethics
 madhyayugin vichaarak saint augustin va thomas equinas kii rachanaaon main dharamshastra va nitishastra ke saath raajnneeti kii ghanishthata prakat hoti he
 Maciavali, the early 16th century scholar of the modern era, used history in its ideological basis
 uske baad habs ne jyamiti, yantriki tathaa chikitsavigyaan ke tathyon va siddhanton kaa upyog kiya
 Rousseau and Montescue explained the closeness of politics and geography
 18veen sadi ke uttararddh va 19veen sadi ke praarambhik kaal main raajnneeti vigyaan va anya samaaj vigyaanon ke bich ghanishtha sambandh swikaarne main baadha aayi kyonki is kaal main vibhinn vigyaanon dwaara apane ko purna evam swatantra vigyaan maanane par bal diya gaya
 But from the middle of the 19th century, again the fact began to be accepted that all social sciences have close relations
 karl marks evam august kamte ne saamaajik vigyaanon kii ghanishthata par bal diya
 With the beginning of the 20th century, political science's intimacy with other sciences was often unquestionably accepted
 vyavahaarwad evam uttar-vyavahaarwad ne antar-anushaasanamak adhyayan kii anivaaryta ko sthapit kiya
 American political scientists, especially the Chicago School of Political Science, have contributed to this development
 ketelin, charles marium, goswell, laswell, david easton, stuart rice, ve
o
 kii
 Adi cemented inter-disciplinary studies based on empirical evidence
 paul jenet ne likhaa he- The summary is that there is mutual interdependence in sociology
 koi bhi ek samaaj vigyaan samaajakaa uchit evam samgr adhyayan nahin kar saktaa
 Therefore, all sociology are related among themselves and the method of interstructural study has again raised this relation of sociology
 aaj rajnatik arthshaastra, rajnatik naitikta, rajnatik itihaas, rajnatik samajashaastra, rajnatik manovigyaan, tathaa rajnatik bhugol aadi vibhinn raajnneeti vigyaan kii nai shakhaon kaa khulanaa is baat kaa pratik he ki raajnneeti vigyaan anya samaaj vigyaanon se sambandh sthapit kiye bina nahin chalasaktaa

 Rahim has chosen for example in poetry the scripts of texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana and Gita and has tried to explain the temporal life behavior aspect by him, which offers a glimpse of Indian culture
 abdurrarahim khaankhaana kaa janm sanwat 1613 i
 main itihaas prasiddh bairam khan ke ghar lahore main hua tha
 Incidentally at that time, Humayun was present with the military in Lahore to resist the invasion of Alexander Suri
 bairam khan ke ghar putr kii utpati kii khabar sunakar ve swayan vahaan gayi or us bachche kaa naam “rahim’ rakhaa
 Rahim's father Bairam Khan was the tantrum and guardian of thirteen-year-old Akbar
 bairam khan khan-e-khaanaa kii oopaadhi se sammanit the
 He was the brother-in-law and intimate friend of Humayun
 rahim kii maan vartmaan haryana praant ke mewati rajput jamaal khan kii sundar evam gunavati kanya sultanaa begum thi
 When Rahim was five years old, his father Bairam Khan was killed in 1561 in Patan Nagar, Gujarat
 rahim kaa paalan-poshan akbar ne apane dharm-putr kii tarah kiya
 As a royal dynasty, Rahim was given the title of 'mirza Khan'
 rahim ne baba jambur kii dekh-rekh main gahan adhyayan kiya
 At the end of education, Akbar got Rahim married to his daughter's daughter Mahabano
 iske baad rahim ne gujarat, kumbhalaner, udaipur aadi yudhon main vijay praapt kii
 On this, Akbar honored Rahim with the highest title of his time, 'mirarj'
 san 1584 main akbar ne rahim ko khan-e-khaanaa kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya
 Rahim died in 1627 at the age of 71
 rahim ko unki ichha ke anusaar dilli main hi unki patni ke makbare ke paas hi dafna diya gaya
 These mausoleums are still present in Delhi
 rahim ne swayan hi apane jeevankaal main iskaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 Humayun chose Bairam Khan for the education of Crown Prince Akbar and appointed Akbar's guardian in the last days of his life, giving him the responsibility of managing the state
 bairam khan ne kushal niti se akbar ke rajya ko majboot banane main puraa sahyog diya
 For some reason there was a difference of opinion between Bairam Khan and Akbar
 akbar ne bairam khan ke vidroh ko safaltaapurvak dabaa diya or apane ustad kii maan evam laaj rakhte hue use haj par jane kii ichha jataai
 As a result, Bairam Khan left for Haj
 bairam khan haj ke liye jate hue gujarat ke patan main tehre or patan ke prasiddh sahasraling sarovar main nauka-vihaar ke baad tat par baithe the ki bhent karne kii niyat se ek afgaan sardaar mubarak khan aayaa or dhokhe se bairam khan kii hatya kar di
 Mubarak Khan did this to avenge his father's death
 is ghatana ne bairam khan ke parivaar ko anaath bana diya
 Not only did these fraudsters commit murder, but they also caused a lot of looting
 vidhwaa sultanaa begum apane kuch sevakon sahit bachakar ahmedabad aa gai
 As soon as Akbar came to know about the incident, he sent a message to Sultana Begum to return to the court
 raste main sandesh paakar begum akbar ke darbar main aa gai
 At such a time, Akbar, giving proof of his greatness, gave shelter to him with great generosity and said to Rahim, "keep it happy in all ways
" ise yah pataa na chale ki inke pita khan khaanaan kaa saaya sar se uth gaya he
 Baba said to Jambur that this is our son
 ise hamaari drushti ke saamne rakhaa karo
 In this way, Akbar raised Rahim just like a son of religion
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat akbar ne vidhwaa sultanaa begum se vivaah kar liya
 Akbar honored Rahim with the title of "mirza Khan" as per the royal family
 rahim kii shiksha- diksha akbar kii udaar dharm- nirpeksh niti ke anukool hui
 Due to this education, the poetry of Rahim remains a thunderous neck of the Hindus even today
 dinakar ji ke kathananusaar akbar ne apane deen-ilaahi main hindootv ko jo sthaan diya hoga, usase kai guna zyada sthaan rahim ne apni kavitaaon main diya
 It is said about Rahim that he was a Muslim by religion and a pure Indian by culture
 rahim kii shiksha samaapt hone ke pashchaat samraat akbar ne apane pita humayun kii parampara kaa nirvaah karte hue, rahim kaa vivaah bairam khan ke virdohi mirza ajij coca kii bahan mahabaanon se karvaa diya
 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
 Rahim was married at the age of about sixteen
 akbar ke darbar ko pramukh padon main se ek mir arj kaa pad tha
 After getting this post, any person would become rich overnight, because this post was such that by which the public's complaint reached the emperor and the decisions taken by the emperor were also conveyed to the public through this post
 is pad par har do- teen dinon main nae logon ko niyukt kiya jaataa tha
 Emperor Akbar appointed his true and trusted character Amir Rahim as Mustakil Mir Arj to run this post smoothly
 yah nirnay sunakar sara darbar sann rah gaya tha
 Holding this position meant that the person is generally reliable both in public and the emperor
 kaaphi minnaton tathaa aashirwad ke baad akbar ko shaikh saleem chishti ke aashirwad se ek ladkaa praapt ho sakaa, jiskaa naam unhone saleem rakhaa
 Shehzada Salim became indifferent to education due to the high affection of parents and other people
 kai mahaan logon ko saleem kii shiksha ke liye akbar ne lagavaaya
 Sher Ahmed, Mir Kalan and court scholar Abulafzal were among these great people
 sabhi logon kii koshishon ke baavjood shahjada saleem ko padhai main man na laga
 Akbar, as always, chose his final weapon, Rahim Khana Khane, as Salim's atalik
 kaha jaataa he rahim yah gaurav paakar bahut prasann the
 Rahim has composed poetry in both Awadhi and Brajbhasha which is simple, natural and fluent
 unke kavy main shringaar, shant tathaa hasya ras milte hai
 Doha, Soratha, Barwai, Kavitta and Savaiya are his favorite verses
 rahim dohavali, barbai, nayika bhed, madanashtak, raas panchadhyaayi, nagar shobhaa aadi
