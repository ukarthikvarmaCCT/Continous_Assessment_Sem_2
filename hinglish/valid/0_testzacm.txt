 The decision was announced by George v on 12 December
 is yojana ke tahat governor general ke awaas ko pradhan or ativ vishesh darja diya gaya
 The British architect Sir Edwin Landasier Lutyens, who was a key member of the town plan, was assigned the design of the building site
 iske mul yojana ke anusaar, kuch aisa bananaa tha, jo ki poorviy or paashchaatya style kaa mishran ho
 In the opinion of some people, this palace should have been in the traditional style, which would have been in the ancient Greek style
 lekin yah bharat main spashtatah paashchaatya shakti pradarshan hota, jo ki amaanya tha
 On the other hand, many people believed that it should be completely Indian style
 in donon ke mishran ke kai anupaat bhi prastaavit the
 The Viceroy then said that the palace would be traditional, but without the Indian motif
 yahi vah abhiklpana thi, jo ki moort rup main aaj khadi he
 This palace was built in the same form as the Lutyens sent Baker from Shimla on 14 June 1912
 lootyans kii abhiklpana vrahat rup se paramparaagat thi, jo ki bhartiya vaastukala se varnmel, byore, ityadi main atyadhik prerit thi, saath hi viceroy ke aadesh ke anusaar bhi thi
 Lutyens and Baker, who were assigned to the Viceroy's House and Secretariats, initially acted fairly cordially, but later also quarreled
 baker ko is bhawan ke aage bane do sachivalayon kii yojana kaa kaary diya gaya tha
 According to the initial plan, the Viceroy House was to be built atop Raisina Hill and both secretariats were to be built below
 baad main sachivalayon ko 400 gaj peeche khiskaakar pahari par hi bananaa tay hua
 According to the plan of Lutyens, this building would have been situated at a lonely height, which had to be pushed back from its original plan due to the secretariats, as well as both the secretariats were standing ahead, so that it was lost in sight
 yahi unke vivaad kaa kaaran tha
 At the completion of this palace, the Lutyens had a good fight with Baker, as the Viceroy's house was, of course, obstructed by the high angle of the road
 lootyans ne is vivaad ko bakerlu ke str kaa mana
 But despite a lot of effort, it could not be changed
 vah chahta tha, ki bhawan se neeche tak ek lambi dhaal par sadak aaye, jisase ki bhawan kaa drishy naa baadhit ho, evam dur se bhi drishy ho
 In 1914, a committee consisting of Baker and Lutyens decided that the road slope should be 1 in 25, which later became 1 in 22 only
 isse adhik khadi dhaal bhawan ke dashya ko or baadhit karti
 Lutyens knew that even this gradient would not be fully visible
 tab usne ise kam karaane kaa nivedan kiya
 In 1916, the Imperial Delhi Committee rejected this proposal of Lutyens
 lootyans ne tab bhi yahi samajha ki baker sarkaar ko khush karke or paise banane main adhik laga tha, naa ki acchhee shrenee kii vaastu roopankan main dhyaan kedrit karne main
 Lutyens traveled to India and England almost twenty two years each year to build Viceroy buildings in both places

 yahaan paramparaagat bartiya chajje bhi hai, jo ki aath feet diwaar se baahar ko nikle hue hai or neeche pushpakriti se sampann hai
 These prevent the building from falling into the windows of direct sunlight and rainwater and spray in the monsoon

 Lutyens has used several Indian-style specimens at appropriate locations, which are quite impressive

 Lutyens have also made some personal effects in the building, such as a space in the garden wall and two skylights in the state room, which look like spectacles
 yah bhawan mukhyatah 1929 main, baaki nai dilli ke saath hi, purna ho gaya tha or iskaa aadhikarik udghaatan san 1931 main hua tha
 It is an interesting fact that this building was completed in seventeen years and was able to remain in the British state for only seventeen years
 apane nirmaan purna hone ke aththarahawein varsh hi, yah swatantra bharat main aa gaya
 In 1947, after Indian independence, the then Viceroys resided there and eventually since the Indian Republic in 1950, resided here as the President of the Indian Republic and changed its name to Rashtrapati Bhavan

 In the center of the main part of the palace, just below the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was called the throne room in the British era

 The interior of this room is ornate, to highlight the stone carvings here, rather than the intricate decoration

 It is in all directions on each side of the dome
 is ke kaaran hi, yah gumbad kisi bhi kone se dekhne par, yadi garmi ke dhundhale mausam main dekhen, to tairta hua prathit hota he
 The dome built of reinforced concrete cement of the outer dome began to take its shape around 1929
