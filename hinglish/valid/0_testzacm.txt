 iske mul yojana ke anusaar, kuch aisa bananaa tha, jo ki poorviy or paashchaatya style kaa mishran ho
 In the opinion of some people, this palace should have been in the traditional style, which would have been in the ancient Greek style
 lekin yah bharat main spashtatah paashchaatya shakti pradarshan hota, jo ki amaanya tha
 On the other hand, many people believed that it should be completely Indian style
 in donon ke mishran ke kai anupaat bhi prastaavit the
 The Viceroy then said that the palace would be traditional, but without the Indian motif
 yahi vah abhiklpana thi, jo ki moort rup main aaj khadi he
 This palace was built in the same form as the Lutyens sent Baker from Shimla on 14 June 1912
 lootyans kii abhiklpana vrahat rup se paramparaagat thi, jo ki bhartiya vaastukala se varnmel, byore, ityadi main atyadhik prerit thi, saath hi viceroy ke aadesh ke anusaar bhi thi
 Lutyens and Baker, who were assigned to the Viceroy's House and Secretariats, initially acted fairly cordially, but later also quarreled
 baker ko is bhawan ke aage bane do sachivalayon kii yojana kaa kaary diya gaya tha
 According to the initial plan, the Viceroy House was to be built atop Raisina Hill and both secretariats were to be built below
 baad main sachivalayon ko 400 gaj peeche khiskaakar pahari par hi bananaa tay hua
 According to the plan of Lutyens, this building would have been situated at a lonely height, which had to be pushed back from its original plan due to the secretariats, as well as both the secretariats were standing ahead, so that it was lost in sight
 yahi unke vivaad kaa kaaran tha
 At the completion of this palace, the Lutyens had a good fight with Baker, as the Viceroy's house was, of course, obstructed by the high angle of the road
 lootyans ne is vivaad ko bakerlu ke str kaa mana
 But despite a lot of effort, it could not be changed
 vah chahta tha, ki bhawan se neeche tak ek lambi dhaal par sadak aaye, jisase ki bhawan kaa drishy naa baadhit ho, evam dur se bhi drishy ho
 In 1914, a committee consisting of Baker and Lutyens decided that the road slope should be 1 in 25, which later became 1 in 22 only
 isse adhik khadi dhaal bhawan ke dashya ko or baadhit karti
 Lutyens knew that even this gradient would not be fully visible
 tab usne ise kam karaane kaa nivedan kiya
 In 1916, the Imperial Delhi Committee rejected this proposal of Lutyens
 lootyans ne tab bhi yahi samajha ki baker sarkaar ko khush karke or paise banane main adhik laga tha, naa ki acchhee shrenee kii vaastu roopankan main dhyaan kedrit karne main
 Lutyens traveled to India and England almost twenty two years each year to build Viceroy buildings in both places
 use lord harding ke bajet niyantran ke kaaran imaarat ke aakaar ko kai guna chota bhi karnaa padaa
 Lord Harding, however, directed to reduce the cost by controlling the expenditure
 tathaapi vah chaahate the, ki kuch nishchit maatra main to imaarat main vaibhav darshan hon hi
 There are many circular layers / springs in the building with water fountains
 ye bhartiya sthapaty ke abhinn ang hai
 View of Rashtrapati Bhavan at night bhawan ke saamne saji topein Above the building is an integral part of Indian architecture, the small dome structure - Chhatri
 imaarat main vibhinn bhartiya dizine daale or jode gayi
 There are many circular enclosures / pools that surround the building and also have water fountains, which are integral to Indian architecture
 yahaan paramparaagat bartiya chajje bhi hai, jo ki aath feet diwaar se baahar ko nikle hue hai or neeche pushpakriti se sampann hai
 These prevent the building from falling into the windows of direct sunlight and rainwater and spray in the monsoon
 chat ke upar baniin kai chhatariyaan, bavan kii chat ke us bhaag ko, jahaan mukhya gumbad nahin bana he, vahaan ke sapaat drishy hone se roktin hai
 Lutyens has used several Indian-style specimens at appropriate locations, which are quite impressive
 inamen se kuch hai, baag main bane naag, stambhon par bane saje dhaje hathi or chote khambhon par lage hue baithe hue singh 
 British craftsman Charles Sargent Jagger, known for his many war memorials, decorated elephants on the outer walls
 iske saath hi jaipur stambh ke nikat kaa purna baas relif bhi unheen ne banwaaya tha
 
 laal balua pathar se bani jaaliyaan bhi bhartiya sthapaty se prerit thim
 On the eastern side of the building, on the eastern side, are twelve uneven pillars, with a border at the top, vertical lines and a bake with leaves of acanthus, with bells made in four pendent forms, which is part of Indian Hinduism
 Are an essential part of temples
 prayek stambh ke prayek upree kone par ek ghanti bani he
 It was alleged that since these bells are quiet, the British state in India will not end
 prasaad ke saamne kii ore koi khidki nahin he, sivaay kinaaron kii ore bani hui vaali ke
 Lutyens have also made some personal effects in the building, such as a space in the garden wall and two skylights in the state room, which look like spectacles
 yah bhawan mukhyatah 1929 main, baaki nai dilli ke saath hi, purna ho gaya tha or iskaa aadhikarik udghaatan san 1931 main hua tha
 It is an interesting fact that this building was completed in seventeen years and was able to remain in the British state for only seventeen years
 apane nirmaan purna hone ke aththarahawein varsh hi, yah swatantra bharat main aa gaya
 In 1947, after Indian independence, the then Viceroys resided there and eventually since the Indian Republic in 1950, resided here as the President of the Indian Republic and changed its name to Rashtrapati Bhavan
 iskaa gumbad, lootyans ke anusaar roman pantheyan se prerit bataaya gaya tha
 By the way, it is derived from Sanchi Stupa, Sanchi, Madhya Pradesh originally built in the Mauryan period
 yahaan europian or mughal sthapatyakala ke ghatak bhi hai
 This building as a whole is completely different from other British buildings

 There is a separate wing for the Viceroy and a separate wing for the devotees
 viceroy skandh apane aap main, ek alag chaar manjila makaan he, jisamen apane swayan ke angan hai
 It is so big, that the first President of India, Mr
 Rajendra Prasad, preferred to stay in the Pahuna wing instead of staying here
 yahi parampara unke uttaradhikariyon dwaara bhi anugamit hui
 In the center of the main part of the palace, just below the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was called the throne room in the British era
 tab yahaan viceroy or unki patni ke liye rajgaddiyaan hoti thim
 The interior of this room is ornate, to highlight the stone carvings here, rather than the intricate decoration
 aise hi adhikansh kakshon main kiya gaya he
 The pillars here are like the main pillars outside, with bell and vertical lines at the top
 deevaaron ke upar yahi border bhi hai
 There is a two-tonne chandelier in the middle of the chamber, which hangs from the 33 meter high ceiling
 is vishaal kaksh ke chaaron konon par sthit he ek kaksh prati kone
 Two of these are State Drawing Cells, a State Upper Room and a State Library
 anya kaksh galiyare jaise bhi hai, jo ki ek orkhule hai
 These open into the courtyard below
 ek vrahat bhojan kaksh, baithak kaksh, billiards kaksh or ek bada ball kaksh or kai jeene hai
 Water fountains and basins have been built at many places throughout the region, some of which are also near the Viceroy's staircase
 inamen aath sangmarmar ke sher chah jal basinon main pani daalate hue bane hai
 This lion was indicative of Britain
 inamen se ek kaksh kii khuli chat bhi he, jo ki prachur maatra main prakritik prakaash detii he

 This dome is situated in the middle of the diagonals between the four corners of the building
 yah puure bhawan kii oonchai kii duguni oonchai kaa he
 Its height in the 1913 building plan was increased by Lord Hardinge
 is gumbad main paramparaagat or bhartiya shaileyon kaa mishran he
 According to Lutyens, the form has emerged from the Pantheon of Rome, but it is also possible that it was built on the inspiration of the Sanchi Stupa
 is gumbad ghere hue ek dwaar mandap bana hua he, jisamen samaan sthit stambh hai, jo ki gumbad ko uthaae hue hai or in stambhon ke bich khaali sthaan he
 It is in all directions on each side of the dome
 is ke kaaran hi, yah gumbad kisi bhi kone se dekhne par, yadi garmi ke dhundhale mausam main dekhen, to tairta hua prathit hota he
 The dome built of reinforced concrete cement of the outer dome began to take its shape around 1929
 is gumbad kaa antim pashaan 6 april 1929 ko lagaaya gaya tha
 Although the copper cover was not installed on it till 1930
 bhawan ke thik saamne se ek maarg naarangi badarpur bajri se dhanka hua sidhaa lohe ke mukhya dwaar rupi phatak tak jaataa he, jo ki us phatak se hota hua, dono sachivalayon, north block or south block ke bich se ho kar laal deevaaron ke bich se neeche utarataa he or vijay chowk se hota hua, rajpath kehalaata he
 This route leads to India Gate

 There is a lot of wonderful flowers here
 akele gulab kii hi 250 se bhi adhik kismein hai
 The Mughal Garden was conceived by Lady Harding
 unhone srinagar main nishat or shalimaar baag dekhe the, jo unhen bahut bhaaye
 Just then the Mughal Garden sat in his mind
 bharat ke ab tak jitne bhi raashtrapati is bhawan main nivas karte aae hai, unke mutabik isamen kuch na kuch badlaav jarur hue hai
 The first President, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad did not make any changes to this garden, but he talked about opening this special garden to the public
