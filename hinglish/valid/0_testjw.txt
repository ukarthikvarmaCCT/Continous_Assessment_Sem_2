 blast fernes main kachche maal ko charge karne ke liye kai tarah ke tareekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Some blast furnaces use a "double bell" system where two "bells" are used to control the entry of raw materials into the blast furnace
 in donon belon kaa uddeshy blast fernes main garm gaison ke nuksaan ko kam karnaa he
 The raw material is first emptied into the upper or smaller bell
 uske baad adhik sahi dhang se charge kaa vitaran karne ke liye bel ko ek purv nirdhaarit pariman main ghumaya jaataa he
 The smaller bell is then opened to empty the charge in the larger bell
 uske baad blast fernes ko band karne ke liye chote bel ko band kar diya jaataa he jabaki bada bel blast fernes main charge ko vitarit karata he

 These valves prove to be more accurate than skip or carrier systems in controlling the magnitude of each component to be added, which increases the efficiency of the furnace
 inamen se kuch bel rahit pranaaliyon main charge ko sthapit karne ke sthaan ko thik se niyantrit karne ke liye shoot kaa istemaal bhi kiya jaataa he
 The iron-making blast furnace itself is made of a long chimney-like structure with refractory bricks

 Four "detectors" help the hot and dirty gas to come out of the furnace's dome while the "bleeder valve" protects the upper part of the furnace from a sudden increase in gas pressure
 plag-in kar dene ke baad bleader vaalvon ko ek bleader clinar se saafe karnaa padataa he
 The coarse angles present in the gas get trapped in the "dust catcher" and put into a railroad car or truck to expel them while the gas itself is passed through a venturi scrubber and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the clean gas
 Passes

 aupchaarik shiksha ke kshetra main paathyacharya yaa paathyakram vidhyalay yaa vishvavidhyalay main pradaan kiye jane vaale paathyakramon or unki saamagree ko kehete hai
 The course is instructional and is based on the more general syllabus which only specifies which level of understanding is required to achieve a specific grade or standard
 1918 main is vishay par prakashit pratham pustak da karikulam main jon franklin baubit ne kaha ki ek vichaar ke rup main paathyakram kii jaden res-course ke liye latin shabd main he or paathyakram kaa varnan aise kaaryon evam anubhavon ke rup main kiya he jinke madhyam se bachche apekshit vayask ke rup main viksit hote hai taaki vayask samaaj main safalataa praapt kii ja sake
 In addition, the curriculum includes not only the experiences in the school but also the constitutional work and experiences in the school and beyond; Experiences that have been unplanned and unspecified, and experiences that have been deliberately directed towards the purposeful formation of adult members of society
 baubit ke liye paathyakram ek saamaajik ejineering kaa kshetra he
 According to their cultural projections and social definitions, there are two notable characteristics of their curriculum construction: Scientific experts based on their special knowledge about what qualities adult members of society should have and what experiences will produce such qualities, they can create courses
 And the course is defined as work experiences that are The student must possess the required adult to become an adult
 isliye, unhone paathyakram ko logon ke charitra kaa nirmaan karne vaale kaaryon evam anubhavon kii thos vaastaviktaa ke sthaan par ek adarsh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 Contemporary notions of curriculum reject these elements of the bobbit, but maintain the premise that the curriculum is a period of experiences that make humans human
 paathyakramon ke madhyam se vaiyaktik gathan kaa vyaktigat or samuhik str par adhyayan kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye peshewar gathan, aitihaasik anubhav ke madhyam se shaikshik anushaasan)
 ek samooh kaa gathan uske vyaktigat pratibhaagiyon ke gathan ke saath hi hota he
 Although it has formally appeared in Bobbitt's definition, the discussion of the curriculum as a form of creative experience can also be seen in John Dewey's work
 Although Bobbitt and Dewey's idealistic understanding of the term "curriculum" differs from current restricted uses of the term, course authors and researchers generally view it as a uniform factual understanding of the curriculum
 aupchaarik shiksha yaa schuli shiksha main ek paathyakram, kisi vidhyalay yaa vishvavidhyalay main pradaan kiye jane vaale paathyakramon, paathyakram sambandhi kaaryon or unki saamagree ko kehete hai
 a syllabus can be prescribed partially or completely by an external, official institution
 america main prayek rajya vyaktigat skool jilon main padhaaye jane vaale paathyakram ko sthapit karata he
 haalanki prayek rajya sanyukt rajya america shiksha vibhaag dwaara chaynit rashtriya academik vishay samoohon kii vyapak bhagidaari se apane paathyakram taiyaar karata he
 For example, the National Council of Mathematics Teachers for Mathematics Education
 The Education Department of every state in Australia establishes a curriculum in 2011 with plans for a national curriculum
 unesco ke antarrashtriya shiksha beuro kaa praathmik mishan he, duniya bhar main paathyakramon kaa adhyayan karnaa or unke kriyanvayan par najar rakhana
 The curriculum has two meanings: courses from which students choose the subject of their choice and a specific education program
 In the latter case the syllabus collectively describes the learning, knowledge and available assessment material of the given course for study
 vartmaan main, ek sarpil paathyakram ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he jiske madhyam se chaatr adhyayan kiye ja rahe vishyon kii saamagree ko vikaas ke vibhinn staron par aank sakenge
 The constructivist approach to the Tycoil curriculum proposes that children learn best through active involvement with the educational environment, that is, learning by discovery
 The curriculum is important for course objectives that are typically represented as learning outcomes
 And usually include the program's evaluation strategy
 These results and assessments are classified as units and therefore the syllabus is a collection of units where each unit consists of specific and definite parts of the syllabus
 to ek saamaanya paathyakram main sanchaar, sankhyatmak kaary, soochna praudyogiki or saamaajik kaushal kii ikaiyaan shaamil hoti hai or prayek ke liye vishisht shikshan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Many educational institutions are currently trying to balance the two conflicting forces
 ek ore kuch kaa maananaa he ki sabhi chaatro ke gyaan kii neenv ko ek samaan hona chahie, samaan prakaar ke paathyakram ke rup main; vahin duusari ore anya chaahate hai ki chaatro ke paas apni pasandida shiksha prapti kaa adhikaar hona chahie, iske liye ve shuruyaat main hi kisi vishay main visheshgyata praapt karne kii koshish kar sakate hai yaa apni pasand ke hisaab se apane vishyon ko chun sakate hai
 This tension has been the subject of much discussion as Harvard University restructured its core requirements
 prayek course kii purv-aavashyaktaaon kii pahchaan, paathyakram dizin kii ek anivaary visheshta he jise har college suchi evam vidyalayan shiksha ke har str par dekha ja saktaa he
 These requirements can be met by specialized courses and in some cases by examination or work experience
 saamanytah kisi bhi vishay main adhik unnat paathyakramon ke liye kuch buniyadi paathyakramon kii neenv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, lekin kuch corcej main anya vibhaagon main adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jaise ki bhautikee main visheshgyata praapt karne ke liye ganit kii kuch kakshaen aavashyak hai yaa sahitya, sangeet athwa vaigyanik shodh ke chaatro ke liye bhashaa praveenta kii aavashyaktaa
 ek adhik vistrut paathyakram ko banaate samay kisi paathyakram ke bheetar rakhe gaye prayek vishay kii purv-aavashyaktaaon kaa avashya dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 Once mutual dependencies between disciplines are known, problems of course arrangement and duration begin to arise
 shikshan main ek mukhya paathyakram, ek paathyakram athwa adhyayan kaa course hota he jisaki bhoomika ko kendriya mana jaataa he tathaa jise aamtaur par ek skool yaa skool paddati ke sabhi chaatro ke liye anivaary rup se lagu kiya jaataa he
 However, this is not always the case
 udhaaharan ke liye, koi skool sangeet sambandhi kaksha ko anivaary kar saktaa he lekin yadi chaatr yadi arcestra, band, kores ityadi jaisi kisi pradarshan sambandhi sangeet main bhaag lete hai to ve isse baahar rahane kaa chunaav kar sakate hai
 The major curriculum is often established at the primary and secondary levels by school boards, education departments or other administrative institutions looking after the work of education
 sanyukt rajya america main "kaaman kor state standard inishiative " rajyon ko ek pramukh paathyakram apnaane or uskaa vistaar karne ke liye protsaahit karti he
 The objective of this coordination is to promote greater use of similar textbooks in the states and more equality in the attainment of minimum level of education
 2009-10 main rajyon ko in maanakon ko apnaane ke liye protsaahan ke rup main sangh ke 'res tu di top' kaarykram se dhan muhaiyaa karwaane kii sambhaavn kaa aashwaasan diya gaya
 Many college and university administration and faculty sometimes make core courses compulsory at the undergraduate level, especially in the liberal arts
 Due to the depth and greater specialization of the major subjects that students are studying, a common core curriculum of higher education prescribes a much smaller amount of student work than a high school or elementary school
 america ke pramukh collejon ke pramukh paathyakram kaaryakramon main se sarvaadhik prasiddh evam vistrut kaaryakramon main, colombia vishvavidhyalay ke colombia college tathaa chicago vishvavidhyalay kaa naam aata he
 It can take up to two years to complete both without any advanced specialization and they are designed to develop important skills in a variety of academic disciplines, such as: social sciences, humanities, physical and biological sciences, Mathematics, writing and foreign languages
 1999 main chicago vishvavidhyalay ne apane kor paathyakram kii saamagree ko ghataane or sanshodhit karne kii yojana kii ghoshnaa kii, jisame shaamil tha aavashyak paathyakramon kii sankhya 21 se ghataakar 15 karnaa or vishyon kii ek or adhik vyapak shrinkhalaa ko pradaan karnaa
 When the New York Times, The Economist and other major news characters began printing about this story, it became a focal point of national debate on university education
 da neshnal association of scolers ne ek bayaan jari karte hue kaha ki, "chicago vishvavidhyalay dwaara apane behtareen snaatak kor paathyakram kaa yah parityag vaaki kaaphi niraashajanak he, jo ek lambey samay tak america shaikshanik sanstha ke bich ek maanak ke rup main sthapit rahaa he
 "however, university administrators like Chairman Hugo Sonnenshin also argued that downsizing the core curriculum had become financially and academically mandatory as the university was finding it difficult to attract the appropriate number of applicants to its undergraduate department This was because its very elaborate core curriculum was not being liked by "an average 18-year-old"
 iske alaava jaise-jaise beesvin sadi main kai america skulon ke kor paathyakram main kami aane lagi, kai choti sansthaaen aise kor paathyakram ko apnaane ke liye prasiddh ho gayin jinamein chaatr kii lagbhag puri snaatak shiksha ko samahit kiya jaataa tha or vigyaan sahit sabhi vishyon ko padhaane ke liye aksar paaramparik pashchimi siddhanton ke paath kaa upyog bhi kiya jaataa tha
 St
 John's College in the United States is an example of this approach
 koncordia vishvavidhyalay, irvin ne bhi 2010 se ek aisa hi paaramparik kor paathyakram lagu kiya he
 Some colleges try to strike a balance between specified and unspecified curriculum using a system of delivery requirements
 aisi pranali main chaatro ko vishesh shreniyon main course lenaa aavashyak hota he lekin ve in shreniyon ke bheetar apni pasand se chunaav kar sakate hai
 Other institutions have almost completely eliminated these curriculum-related requirements, for example, courses at Brown University and Cornell University are entirely in the hands of the student
 amherst college main chaatr ko pratham-varsh seminaron kii suchi main se kisi ek ko chunanaa hota he lekin iske liye kisi kaksha athwa vitaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he

 In the case of a newspaper, which was thrice approved by the Council, to recommend to the Council the recommendation of the concerned authorities for not giving certain facilities and concessions in the form of postage concessions or delivery of news papers, advertisements, recognition for certain periods
 In order to delegate powers, the Council proposed an amendment to the Act in 1980
 praadhikariyon kii ore se parishad kii sifarison ke sweekruti kii anivaary hone kii maang kii gai
 In addition, the Council was of the view that under section 15 of the Press Council Act 1978, similar to the matters of newspapers, in any of its decisions or reports respecting the conduct of any authority including the Government, to make such comments as it may deem fit The authority of the Council should also include the right to warn, condemn or censure such authorities
 And that, the comments of the Council in this regard should be placed before both the Houses of Parliament and or the legislation of the concerned state
 varsh 1987 main, parishad ne maamle par punarvichaar kiya or vistrut vichaar-vimarsh ke pashchaat dandatmak adhikaar hetu prastaav ko vaapis lene kaa nirnay kiya kyonki is sambandh main punarvichaar kiya gaya ki vartmaan paristhitiyon main press kii swatantraaa par ankush lagane ke liye praadhikariyon dwaara in adhikaron kaa durupyog kiya ja saktaa tha
 Since then, repeated suggestions have been made to the Council that the Council should have punitive powers to punish defaulting newspapers / journalists
 iske jawaab main parishad ne lagaataar yahi vichaar kiya he ki adhinium kii vidyaman yojana ke antargat ise diye gayi naitik adhikaar paryaapt hai
 This suggestion was reiterated by the Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting in its inaugural address at the International Conference of Press Circles in New Delhi in October 1992, but the Council unanimously rejected it for the following reasons - yadi parishad ko dand dene / jurmaana lagane kaa adhikaar de diya jaataa to yah dand dene ke adhikaar ke samaan hota joki keval tabhi lagu hota he jab press dwaara sarkaar tathaa iske praadhikariyon ke viruddh shikaayatein kii jaati hai
 The right to impose meaningful punishment raises a number of matters including a, obligation of proof, b, level of proof, c, right to legal representation and cost and d, review and or whether an appeal will be available
 in maamalon main se sabhi athwa kisi ek kaa prabhaav mul aadhaar ke virodh main ho saktaa he ki press pariden shikayaton kii sunwaayee ke liye loktantric, prabhavi or sasti suvidha pradaan karti hai or yah ki parinami anivaaryta yah hogi ki iske parinamswaroop press pariden aupchaarikta, laagat or pahunch kii jaani-maani samasyaon or nyaayik adhikaar kaa prayog karne vaale nyaayalay ban jaayengi or samaan rup se vilamb hoga jisase press parishad kaa mul uddeshy vifal ho jaayegaa
 In December 1992, the Council received a letter from the Central Government asking for the views of the Council on whether to ensure that the Press Council-issued newspapers / magazines for violation of the guidelines regarding communal articles from the Government
 Receive incentives such as advertisements etc
, may be denied, any process may be specified and whether Race Council will be in a position to suggest that when it blames the violation of guidelines for a newspaper / magazine then you should be proceeding
 parishad ne june 93 kii apni baithak main, parishad ko dandatmak adhikaar diye jane ke viruddh vigat samay main iske dwaara liye gayi stand ke prakaash main maamle par vichaar kiya
 After taking a deeper look at the matter, the Council felt that the moral authority currently being exercised by the Council is quite effective and that the press does not require punitive rights to show self-regulation
 haalanki parishad ne nirnay kiya ki yadi ek samachaarpatr teen varshon main kisi prakaar ke aniatik lekhan ke liye do baar parinindit kiya jaataa he, tab aise nirnyon kii pratiyaan bharat sarkaar ke mantrimandal sachiv or sambaddh rajya sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv, ko suchnarth or aisi kaarywahi, jaisaaki ve apane vivek or maamle kii paristhitiyon main uchit samajhe, hetu bheji jaani chahie
 The Council decided that the period of three years will be taken as the preceding three years, counting inversely from the date of Parininda
 press parishad adhinium, 1978 kii dhara 13 2 khr dwaara parishad ko samachar karmiyon kii sanhaayta tathaa maargdarshan hetu ucch vyayavsayik staron ke anuroop samachaarpatron; samacharan agenciyon or patrakaron ke liye aachaar samhita banane kaa vyadesh diya gaya he
 Creating such a code is an active task that must be integrated step by step with time and events
 nimarn sanket karata he ki press parishad dwaara maamalon ke aadhaar par apane nirnyon ke jariye samhita taiyaar kii jaye
 The Council had prepared a comprehensive set of principles through its decisions / guidelines in 1984 in association with the Indian Institute of Law, under the heading of violation of public interest and journalism policy
 siddhanton kaa yah sankalan parishad ke nirnyon athwa adhinirnyon athwa iske athwa iske dwaara athwa iske adhyaksh dwaara jari morganirdeshon se chunaa gaya he
 In 1986, complaints or cases against the government and its authorities, which were far-reaching and significant in nature and included comments respecting the conduct of any authority, including the government, violated the freedom of the press relating to decisions and principles in the title
 The second part of the compilation was published under
 varsh 1986 se samhita nirmaan kii twarit prakiya sahit shikayaton kii sansthapana or press parishad dwaara unke niptaan main lagaataar vruddhi hoti rahi he
 In 1992, the Council presented the Journalism Policy Guide which contains the journalistic policy principles sorted by the guidelines and decisions issued by the Council
 chunki tab se parishad dwaara press ke adhikaron or dayitvon se sambaddh kai atyadhik mahatvapurn nirnay diye gayi hai, morganirdeshika kaa 162 pruthon kaa vistrut or vyapak doosraa sanskaran jari kiya ja chukaa he
 It also envisages the right to privacy and guidelines in this regard and guidelines to guide the newspapers according to high professional standards have also been specified
 press, saarvajanik karmchaariyon or lokapriy vyaktiyon ke maargdarshan hetu iske kuch pahaluon main manahani kanoon kaa bhi sahyog liya gaya he
 The Council made an important award in relation to the alleged defamation of public officials of the municipal committee that remedies of action against the press or media for damages are not generally available to government officials in relation to their actions and conduct related to the discharge of their official duties, Whether the publication is based on facts and statements that are not true, unless the office SH should not establish that the revelation was done without respect and care for the truth 
 aise maamle main bachaav paksh media athwa press kaa sadsy ke liye yah siddh karnaa paryaapt hoga ki unhone tathyon ke samuchit samyaapan ke pashchaat kaary kiya, unke liye yah siddh karnaa aavashyak nahin he ki unhone jo kuch likhaa he, vah satya he
 But where it is proved that the publication is tending and false to malicious or express hatred, there will be no defense for the defendants and will be liable for the loss
 haalaanki ek saarvajanik padaadhikari koun maamalon main joki unki duty ke nirvaah se sambanddh na hon, vahi suraksha milti he jaisaaki kisi anya naagarik ko milti he
 However, the Judiciary, Parliament and State Legislature are the exception to this rule as the former is protected by the right of punishment for its contempt and is protected from privileges under Articles 105 and 194 of the succeeding Constitution
 parishad ne aage diya he ki iskaa arth yah nahin he ki shaskeey gupt baat adhinium, 1923 athwa koi samaan adhiniuman athwa upbandh jise kanoonee shakti praapt ho, press athwa media par niyantran nahin rakh sakate
 It has also been given that there is no law which empowers the state or its officials to have prior control or prohibition on the press / media
 saarvajanik padaadhikari ke niztaa ke daawey ke sambandh main, parishad ne nirdit kiya he ki yadi saarvajanik padaadhikari kii niztaa or unke nijee aacharan, aadaton vyaktigat kaaryon or charitra kii visheshtaon, jinka takaraav athwa sambandh unki shaskeey duty ke samuchit nirvaah se ho, ke bare main jaanane ke jaanata ke adhikaar ke madhya takaraav ho, to purvavarti ko uttarvarti ke saamne jhukna chahie
 However, in matters of personal privacy not related to the maintenance of their official duties, the public official gets the same protection as any other citizen
 yah morganirdeshika kul milakar vidhi sambandhi, naitik or sadachaar sambandhi samasyaon joki pratidin samachaarpatron ke maalikon, patrakaron sampadakon kaa virodh karti he, ke madhyam se suraksha or jimmevary kaa maarg sujhaati he
 The Guidelines are not a compilation of irrefutable principles but contain broad general principles, which are applied with proper discretion and adaptation, depending on the circumstances of each case, so they are self-restrained to journalists to conduct their business, including the path of professional honesty Will help them to do it
 kisi bhi tarah ye thakaau nahin he na hi inkaa abhipraay sakhti he joki press ke svachhand kaary main baadha daale
 Some of the broad principles developed by the Council in relation to its decision on various subjects, both on the levels of journalism and freedom of the press, are briefly given as follows
 sampradaayon or vyaktiyon par apmanjanak or uttejk hamale nahin kiye jane chahie
 Any news journalism policy on communal incidents based on rumors would be violated
 isi prakaar mahatvapurn chook karte hue vikrut reportig karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 While it is a legitimate task of the press to address this with the intention of resolving the right grievance of a community in a peaceful and legal manner, complaints should not be discovered / or exaggerated especially those complaints involving communal disharmony
 Have the ability to
 swasth or shantipurna vaataavaran paidaa karne main yah atyadhik laabhadaayak hoga yadi sansanikhej uttejk or khatarnaak shirkon ko chhod diya jaye or hinsa athwa barbarta ke kaaryon kii report is prakaar se kii jaye ki rajya kii kanoon or vyavastha main logon kaa vishwaas kam na ho tathaa iske saath-saath isamen aise kaaryon ko hatotsahit karne or unki ninda karne kaa prabhaav ho
 Defaming a sect is a serious matter and it would be condemnable to call it anti-national activity and it is akin to journalistic inconsistency
 vigat galatiyon ko dohraane ke viruddh vartmaan peedi ko chetavanee dene ke liye aitihaasik tathyon ko prakashit karne main koi asangati nahin he chaahe ye galtiyaan ek vishesh sampradaay ke liye ruchikar na hon
 There is no objection in making statements about religious sects if they are given in moderate language and are not given inaccurate or exaggerated
 patrakarita ke anuchit prayog ke sambandh main apane nirnyon ke madhyam se parishad dwaara viksit kiye gayi kuch siddhant hai Any matter shown or discussed in confidence should not be published without the consent of the source
 yadi sampadak ko aisa lagata he ki prakaashan janhit main he, tab use uchit paad-tippanee main yah spat karnaa chahie ki sambaddh vaktavy athwa vichaar-vimarsh prakashit kiya ja rahaa tha yadhyapi ise anadhikarik diya gaya tha
 An advertisement which is illegal or illegal or which is contrary to good faith or journalistic policy or justification should not be published
 samachaarpatron dwaara uddharanon ke sambandh main sateekta banaaye rakhane ke liye samuchit saavdhaanee barti jaani chahie
 Where a newspaper is accused of violating journalistic policy, the argument that it has ceased publication will not protect the editor because his conduct is the subject of the complaint
 ruchi kaa arth sandarbh ke anusaar alag-alag hota he
 For a journalist, this means that they should not publish on the basis of decency or justification
 jahaan ek maamle main yon sambandhi bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kii pravriti ho, patrika main iskaa prakaashan janata, yuva athwa vruddh ke liye avaanchhneeya hoga
 Public interest should be judged with the perception of the prevailing interest in the contemporary society along with the situation
 ashleelata kaa mul pareekshan yah he ki kya maamla itnaa abhadra he ki yah charitra ko bigaad athwa bhrat kar saktaa he
 Another test is whether the portrayal of the language and scene used may be considered dirty, vulgar, distasteful or erotic
 koi bhi kahani ashleel he athwa nahin, patrika kii saahitiyik athwa saanskrithik prakruti or saamaajik viy ke str vastu jaise karkon par nirbhar karengi
 The picture of a case against a magazine or newspaper is related to the question whether the matter published is below the level of public interest
 pikchar janaruchi se kam he athwa nahin, yah parakhane ke sambaddh karkon main se ek patrika kii prakruti athwa uddeshy hoga- kya yah kala, chitrakala, dawa shodh, athwa yon sudhaar se sambaddh he
 The Press Council expressed concern over the increasing instances of pornographic advertisements in the printing media
 yah sansrship ke viruddh thi parantu prakaashan se purv kisi ashleel saamagree kii jaanch hetu nivaaran sambandhi upayon kaa samarthan kiya gaya
 Since most such advertisements are delivered through advertising agencies, the Council felt that this task would not be difficult if these agencies were more prepared to prepare and release such advertisements, which would be considered objectionable by an average citizen in the family
 Use caution and time
 inhone mahasoos kiya ki bharat kii vigyaapan agenciyon kaa sangh in sabhi vigyaapan agenciyon ke sangrakshak sanghathan ke rup main maamle main atyadhik mahatvapurn or sakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaa sakegaa or aise vigyaapan na dene main inke sahyog kii maang kii joki jinase sighra samay mendesh ke saamaajik saanskrithik mulyon ko nuksaan pahunchne kii sambhaavna ho
 The Council also appealed to the newspapers to carefully examine the advertisements received directly from advertisers or from advertising agencies and exercise self-restraint by rejecting advertisements deemed indecent and objectionable
 akshepit prakaashan ke viruddh swayan dwaara banaaye gayi nimnlikhit morganirdeshon ko bhi inhone doharaaya
 Newspapers should not give advertisements that are obscene or depict a woman in nudity to provoke the sexuality of men as if it were an object of sale itself
 ek tasviir ashleel he athwa nahin, yah teen pareekshanon ke sambandh main parkhaa janaa chahie, abhidhantah 1, is it vulgar and hopeless, 2, kya yah keval ashleel lekhan kaa ansh he, 3, Is the purpose of this publication only in those among whom it is intended to circulate, and to earn money by stimulating the sexual feelings of adolescents
 duusare shabdon main, kya yah vanijyik laabh ke liye hanikaarak shon he
 Another relevant point of view is that the picture is related to the thematic matter of the magazine
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kya iskaa prakaashan kala, chitrakala, dawa, shodh athwa yon sudhaar kisi saamaajik athwa lok uddeshy ke purv chintan kii purti karata he
 The basic principle that emerges from various awards on this view supports the editor's self-determination in the publication of letters
 haalaanki, inase aashaa kii jaati he ki ve saarvajanik prakruti ke maamle par galat vaktavy athwa report ko swayan thik karenge
 On the basis of public right to know, the common reader can claim a legitimate right
 iske atirikt, koi vyakti jiskaa prakaashan main viy rup se sandarbh diya gaya ho, samachaarpatr ke stambho main uttar ke adhikaar ke liye swatah daawa kar saktaa he
 If the Council does not have the right to force a newspaper to publish a response, it may direct the newspaper to publish the details of the investigation against it
 prakaashan se purv samachar kaa satyaapan aavashyak he vishe rup se jab report main apmanjanak athwa likhit manahani sambandhi adhiswar hon athwa isse sampradayik tanaav ho saktaa ho, na hi kinhin paristhitiyon main bhi logon ke duusare varg ke vichaaron ke rup main afvaahon kaa prakaashan nyyochit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Whenever a false or malformed publication is noticed by the editor, they should make necessary amendments
 bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 499 ke duusare apwaad ke antargat ek saarvajanik karmchaaree ke saarvajanik kaaryon ke nirvaah main unke aacharan kaa sammaan karte hue athwa unke charitra kaa sammaan karte hue, jahaan tak us aacharan main unka charitra dikhaai detaa he, kuch anya nahin, sadbhaavna main raay abhivyakt karnaa manahani nahin he
 Accordingly, the Council is of the opinion that proper comments / comments on life cannot be said to be inappropriate but if any factual statements are made, they should be true and correct
 yadi koi manahanijanak tatv judaa hota he, to nuksaan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii civil kaarywahi main adhik sadbhaavna bachaav nahin hoga
 The Press Council of India has laid down guidelines to achieve a balance between the right of privacy of the public and the right of the public to access information of public interest and public importance
 ratreey or antarratreey str tathaa dilli main april 1998 main press parishadon ke vishwa sangh ke sammelan main hui garma garam bahes main bal diya gaya ki is sambandh main teen pratiyogi sanvaidhanik mulyon ke madhya saamanjasy sthapit karne kii aavashyaktaa he, arthatah A, a person's right to privacy, kha, press kii swatantraaa or C, People's right to know about popular persons in public interest

 Public individuals who act as representatives of the public cannot expect to get the same degree of privacy as private individuals

 Public interest is being kept out of public interest, even if privately, it should be brought to the notice of the people through the press
 iske anuroop yah sunishchit karnaa press kii duty he ki saarvajanik vyakti ke saarvajanik hit ke aise kaaryon or aacharan ke bare main soochna sahi tareekon se praapt kii jaati he, samuchit rup se satyapit karne or tatpashchaat sateek report di jaati he
 Monitoring methods are not expected from the press to get information about the work done away from public eye
 jahaan se yah aashaa kii jaati he ki lokapriy vyaktiyon ko tang na karen, vahiin lokapriy saarvajanik vyaktiyon se bhi yah aashaa kii jaati he ki ve apni karypranali main adhik khulaapan laayen tathaa janata ko unke pratinidhiyon ke kaaryon ke baaren main suchit karne kii press kii dyuty ko puraa karne main press ko sahyog den
 An attack on a newspaper or people who are associated with it as an editorial or in management, with the intention of pressuring or intimidating them for the opinions expressed in the newspaper is a gross interference in the freedom of the press

 Apart from this, wherever there is a serious situation in which the press is expected to act with restraint and caution, the President of the Council has been guiding the press through statements
 jab kabhi bhi suniyojit biihat hamale kiye gayi, tab inhone aise vaktavyon ke madhyam se teevr pratikriya bhi kii
 In 1969, the Council issued 10-point guidelines specifying rules and levels in reporting and commenting on matters related to communal relations

 The Council said that the principles outlined in it should be embedded at every level of the media from the stage of training
 in siddhanton sanlagnak bi-2 ne press or rajya donon ke liye kuch kaary karne or kuch kaary na karne nirdit kiye
 The Council has in the past years formulated a policy framework on certain matters such as selection of journalists, advertisements, news papers, rules of recognition to accompany the President, Prime Minister etc

 The study of these awards shows that the Council was not only pressurized to preserve freedom but also to ensure that the level of journalism is maintained and efforts to achieve its goals like improving it were also undeniably successful
 Has been jahaan press, parishad ke hastkshep ke pashchaat praadhikariyon ko, aamtaur par, press par anuchit dabaav na daalate hue dekha gaya he vahiin press karmiyon ne bhi is prakaar kii patrakarita se swayan par sanyam rakhaa he joki unase, jis str kii aashaa kii jaati he, ko kam kar sakati thi
 The Council's moral impact has been widely accepted
 shikayaton kii sankhya 1979 main 80 se 1997 main 1075 tak kii atyaadhik vruddhi, samachaarpatron par niyantran rakhane ke liye parishad jaisi sanstha kii aavashyaktaa, mahatv or karypranali main media karmiyon or jaanata donon dwaara abhivyikt kiye gayi vishwaas kaa paryaapt pramaan he
 In addition to the investigation on regular complaints, the council has often done special investigation, mostly original action, but sometimes also investigated complaints related to incidents and cases related to the press
 gartala, tripura ke ek bengali samachaarpatr daily deshr katha ke sampadak shri gautam das dwaara unke samachaarpatr bechney waalon or karmchaariyon par congress ai kaaryakartaaon dwaara lagaataar hinsaatmak hamale kiye jane kii shikaayat ke pashchaat press parishad ne ghatnasthal kii samuchit jaanch hetu ek vishesh samiti kaa gathan kiya he
 The committee visited Agartala and heard the complainant and representatives of the Tripura government
 iske parinamswaroop tripura sarkaar ne aashwaasan diya ki ve aisi ghatnaon kii punrariti ko rokane ke liye sabhi aavashyak kadam uthaayenge or deshr katha ko purna suraksha pradaan karenge
 a special investigation was conducted on Ayodhya incidents in 1990 and others in 1992
 inaki report kramshah 1991 or 1993 main saarvajanik kii gai
 In the first inquiry, the council found four Uttar Pradesh Dainik Jagran, today, Swatantra Bharat and Swatantra Chetna to publish such reports which grossly violated journalistic policy rules
 parishad ne niyamon kaa ulanghan karne par in samachaarpatron ko parinindit kiya
 The council also criticized the Uttar Pradesh government for its many errors in dealing with the situation and its behavior towards the press
 jaagran ne parishad ke is nirnay ko elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke sammukh chunauti di, joki lambit he
 He expressed concern over the authorities taking recourse to punitive and preventive proceedings in excess of the demand of the situation and expressed condolences on the call for provisions of the Unwelcome Press Offensive Affairs Act 1951 and misuse of the provisions of the Press and Book Registration Act 1867
 ayodhya main dinaank 6-12-1992 ko vivaadaaspad masjid giraaye jane par aise patrkaar / press media photographer / cameraman joki dinaank 6-12-92 ko ayodhya kii ghatnaon or iske aas-paas kawarej kar rahe the, par kai hamale kiye jane kii report aayin
 As this was a matter of utmost importance and concern, a special inquiry committee was constituted to investigate the matter under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Council
 isse purv adhyaksh mahoday, sampradayik sambandhon par tippaniyan prastut karte hue or ghatnaon kii reporting karte hue press kii ore se sanyam or niyantran rakhe jane kaa aagrah karte hue pehle hi apil jari kar chuke the
 At the same time, he expressed concern over the incidents of attacks on journalists at the time when they are trying to cover up incidents while discharging their professional duties
 unhone praadhikariyon se bhi yah sunishchit karne kii apil kii ki press ko janamahatv ke maamalon par soochna ke prachaar-prasar ke liye swatrata or nirbhikta se kaary karne diya jaye
 The Special Committee, through an order dated 14-12-92, collected oral and written evidence in its meetings in Ayodhya, Faizabad, Lucknow and Delhi, presented its report before the full Council on 7-1-93
 parishad dwaara sweekaar kii gai repot dinaank 8-1-1993 ko jari kii gai
 enclosure-d3 punjab main aatankwaad ke dauraan press or press karmiyon kaa virodh kiye jane or in par dabaavon ke sambandh main jaanch kii gai
 Accepting the report of the Vishay Committee under the title Overcoming the Overcoming Fear Fear, the Council has informed the Punjab Press, truthfully and objectively, about the state and events of the state and by any external authority or organization, by force or intimidation
 Through this, he gave his full support in protest against the demand of any code or rule
 isi prakaar jammu va kashmir main press dwaara saamana kii ja rahi samasyaon par vishe jaanch kii gai
 Accepting the report of this committee in July 1991, the Council stated that the importance of information and communication in the complex and difficult situation in Kashmir was not adequately realized by the government or the media itself
 inhone sthiti ke vibhinn drutkonon kaa prabhavi uttar dene ke liye maapdandon kii shrinkhalaa kaa suzav diya
 The full report was published later under the title Crisis and Credibility
 bihar main press kii swatantra karypranali ke maarg main dabaavon / baadhaon or patrakaron par hamalon kii badhati hui ghatnaon par report jise parishad ne dinaank 31 march 1993 ko sweekaar kiya, main press or praadhikariyon ko apane sambandh adhik swasth santhaapit karne kaa paraamarsh diya gaya
 In the report on AIDS and the media, the media was determined to do some work and not to do anything and they were advised that AIDS must be the target of publicity from sporadic news
 isi samay, press ko yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki janhit joki vyaktigat niztaa ke sangrakshan ke antargat ek maamle ke prakaashan ko nyyochit tehra saktaa he, vaid hit hona chahie na ki viyasakt athwa vikrut jigyaasa
 Another report dated June 1993, which had a shark paned snowboard pen and sword, supported a more open-minded approach to defense-related information
 jammu va kashmir main ugravadi sanghathanon se media ko dhamkiyaan par parishad kii naveenatam report ne ugravadi prachaar kaa saamana karne ke liye sarkari str par soochna ke turant prasar kii sifarish kii he
 The report has also advised the government to provide institutional and regional security to media personnel who face threats from extremists on adopting an independent approach
 varsh 1994 main parishad ne sampurna bharat main lagu karne hetu samaan vigyaapan niti kaa nirmaan kiya
 It provides a criterion for approval of newspapers for registration by the authorities for advertisement
 bhartiya press parishad kaa, vaanchhneeyata athwa anyathaa matdaan purv surveykshanon kii uplabdhiyon ke prakaashan or unke dwaara puraa kiye jane vaale uddeshy ke prashn par vichaar karne ke pashchaat vichaar he ki samachaarpatron ko chunaavon main herpher or vikrutiyon ke liye apane manch kaa istemaal kiye jane kii manjuuri nahin deni chahie or pakshpaati partiyon dwaara swayan ke shon kii sweekruti nahin deni chahie
 Therefore, the advice of Prea Council is that in view of the serious situation of the election process in an ideal democracy like ours, newspapers should be aware that their valuable platform should not be used for election manipulation and distortions
 aaj is par bal dena aavashyak ho gaya he kyonki kathith matdaan purv surveykshanon jose galat tareekon ke istemaal ke saath-saath jaateey, dharmik or naitik aadhaar par jatil or tikshn prachaar dwaara apratyaashit matadaataaon ke bhramit or gumraah karne ke liye dilchaspee rakhane vaale vyaktiyon or samoohon dwaara mudran media ke shon kii maang badhati ja rahi he
 While in many cases it will not be difficult to detect communal and seditious propaganda, it is not easy to reveal the biased use of pre-poll surveys, sometimes done intentionally
 atah press parishad kaa suzav he ki jab kabhi bhi samachaarpatr matdaan-purv surveykshan prakashit karte hai, to unhen un sansthaaon jinhone aise surveykshan kiye hai, vyakti or sanghathan jinhone surveykshan karawaaye hai, chayan kiye gayi namoonay kaa aakaar-prakaar jaanch parinaam hetu namoonay ke chayan kaa tarika or jaanch parinaam main truti kii sambhavit gujaaish kaa sanket dete hue unhen suspat rup se prastaavna main dene kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 2, In addition to this, media is seen giving a post-poll poll which has already taken place when the polling dates are in the red
 isamen un matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne kii sambhaavna rahati he jahaan matdaan abhi armbh hona he
 To ensure that the election process is kept clean and the voters' minds are not influenced by external factors, it is necessary that the media does not publish post-poll surveys till the last vote
 3, atah press parishad press se pasch-matdaan ke bare main nimnlikhit morganirdesh kaa paalan karne kaa anurodh karti he
 No newspaper will publish post-poll surveys, however accurate they may be, until the last voting ends
 gha, bhartiya press parishad dwaara vittiya patrakaron ke liye morganirdeshon kaa nirmaan Press Council of India has advised reporters / financial journalists / newspaper establishments not to take cash or any kind of gifts / grants / concessions / facilities etc
, which are likely to compromise with free and fair reporting on financial matters
 
 2, parishad ne apni report main avlokan kiya ki vittiya patrkaar, pathakon ke mastik ko kaaphi prabhavit karte hai, atah ek company ke stats, bhaviy, vittiya saudon kaa santulan or vastuparak vichaar dena unki jimmedaari he
 He observed that some newspapers / magazines of some companies give excessive news as they have issued advertisements to that printing media
 kabhi-kabhi un companiyon kii pratikul reportein prakashit kii jaati hai joki samachaarpatron athwa patrikaon ko vigyaapan nahin dete hai
 Again, when the media is not happy with a company / management for any reason, the negative aspects of the company are exposed, while its negative, no negative aspects are brought to light
 kuch companeeyon ko kuch vittiya patrakaron se companeeyon ke samarthan main sakaaratmak reportein praapt karne ke liye, unhen uphaar, rin, chhot, praathmik share aadi dene rke lae bhi janaa jaataa he
 Along with this, there is no means for creating public opinion against such wrong actions or for the education of investors
 3, niyamit kshetra main kadachaar par chintit parishad ne, pratinidhi vittiya sansthaanon or patrakaron ke saath vistrut vichaar vimarsh karne ke pashchaat vittiya patrakaron dwaara avlokan hetu nimna varnit morganirdeshon kii sifarish kii he 1, Financial journalists should not accept gifts, loan visits, discounts, primary shares etc
 that compromise their positions, or are likely to compromise
 2, kisi company ke bare main report main pramukh rup se yah ullekh hona chahie ki report company ke vittiya praayojakon athwa company dwaara di gayi soochna par aadhaarit he
 3, when the tour is sponsored for visiting a company arrangement, the author of the report, who has taken advantage of the tour, must mention that the tour was sponsored by the affiliate company and that they have enjoyed hospitality as the case may be

 Whenever a specific advertisement agency or advertiser is accused by the Advertising Council of India, the newspaper in which the advertisement was published should prominently publish the news of the indictment

 The Council made 17 more recommendations, endorsing and agreeing to the recommendations of the Government of Maharashtra policy for women, the main one being that the news of atrocities on women should be published but made them sensational

 The Press Council of India should take precedence and formulate other guidelines etc
 on its part to consider the complaints brought on the allegations of contempt of women

 parishad ne press or pustak panjikaran bill, 1988 ke upbandho par gaharaai se vichaar kiya or nirnay diya ki yah iske uddeshyon ke vivaran se baahar tha
 They did not properly implement the recommendations of the Second Press Commission regarding the subject
 yadhyapi kuch upbandh sakaaratmak prakruti ke the, kuch anya sharaarat se bhare hue the jinke parinamswaroop press kii swatantraaa ko khatra tha
 The council suggested several fundamental changes to the bill
 baad main sarkaar ne bill vaapis le liya
 Similarly, the Council conducted a basic test of the Jammu and Kashmir Privileges Bill, 1984
 inhone bill ke upbandhon par dinaank 29 sitambar 1989 ko press ke vibhinn sanghathanon ke pratinidhiyon or rajya mantriyon ko bhi suna
 Thereafter, the Council decided that the Government of Jammu and Kashmir had sufficient powers in the form of already existing state and central legislations, which were effectively used by the press to deal with cases of gross misconduct for new rights sought under the bill
 Could be done
 parishad ne kaha ki purv-sensorship or jabti ke vyapak adhikaron sahit nivarak kanoon, press ko dabaakar, afvaahon ko khuli chhot de denge or jammu va kashmir tathaa baaki desh main sampurna mudran or prasaaran media kii vishwasaneeyata ko nat kar denge
 The Council was of the view that pre-censorship was inherently against the freedom of the press
 inhone sifarish kii ki bill vaapis le liya jaye
 He recommended to bring the Press Advisory Council back in the state
 baad main rajya vidhansabha main jammu kashmir sarkaar dwaara bill vaapis le liya gaya
 The Council also examined the Karnataka Bill, 1988 and the Karnataka Legislature Bill, 1988 and made several suggestions regarding freedom of the press to make them more effective

 The Council discussed the right to reply in the Press Bill 1974 and considered it in response to the remittance made by the Union Government
 inhone apana vichaar vyakt kiya ki prastaavit vidhaan aavashyaktaa, auchity, jivan kshamta, kaary kshamta or in sabase apni upar vaidhata ke drutkon se subhedya he
 That is why the bill has been withdrawn

 Although it is limited to the proceedings under the Act under the above act, it has been strongly recommended that it be made a part of the general law of the country
 It was equally felt that if an exception is given, in extreme cases where disclosure is absolutely unavoidable in the interest of justice, the right of disclosure order should be conferred only on the Supreme Court and It is also possible that by taking the presiding officer in confidence for the first time, then if he is satisfied that it is appropriate in the decision of the case, then such steps can be taken

 Jagannath Panditraj was a great poet, critic, litterateur and grammarian
 kavi ke rup main unka sthaan ucch kaati ke utkrisht kaviyon main kalidas ke ananthar - kuch vidvan rakhte hai
 His literary erudition as "rasgangadhara" car and the said book has great respect in Panditamandali
 panditraj jagannatha vellanati kulodbhav tailang brahman, godavari jilantargat mungudu gram ke nivasee the
 His father's name was "perubhatta" and his mother's name was Lakshmi
 perubhatta param vidvan the
 He had studied "theosophy" from Gyanendra Monk, Justice and Vaiseshika from Mahendra, "poorvimamsa" from Khandadeva and Mahabhashya from Sheshvireshwar
 ve anek vishyon ke ati praudh vidvan the
 Panditraj studied most of the scriptures from his father
 sheshvireshwar jagannatha ke bhi guru the
 Jagannath, by fame, was earlier the founder and teacher of a school in Jaipur 
 ek kaaji ko vaad-vivaad main parrast karne ke kirtishravan se prabhavit dilli samrat ne unhen bulaakar apana rajpandit banaaya
 It is understood from the mention of "nurdeen" in a verse of "rasgangadhar" that in the last years of Nuruddin Muhammad "jahangir" he came to Delhi and remained in the shadow of the Panipallavas of Delhivallabh till the reign of Shah Jahan and slaughter of Darashikoh
 mughal vidwaan yuvaraj darashikoh ke saath unki maitri ghanishtha thi par uski hatya ke pashchaat unka uttar-jivan mathura or kaashi main main haribhajan karte hue beetaa
 Panditraj had a love and body-relationship with Navanitkomalangi, Yavanasundari, named "lavangi", a courtesan singer / dancer who was not even found in his texts, according to the legends and legends found in his name
 usase unka vidhipurvak vivaah hua yaa nahin, kab or kahan uski mrityu hui - is vishay main bahut si dantakathaayen prachlit hai
 Apart from this, many folklores regarding Panditraj are also popular among Pandits
 kaha jaataa he ki 'yavan sansargadosh' ke kaaran kaashi ke panditon, visheshat: appay dikshit dwaara bahishkrut or tiraskrit hokar unhone ' gangalahari' ke shlokon kaa ucchar karte hue ichhaapurvak pranatyag kiya
 Somewhere it is also heard that both Yavni and Panditraj drowned in the Ganges
 is prakaar kii lokprachlit dantakthaon kaa koi aitihaasik-pramaan uplabdh nahin he
 It seems possible that he had a love affair with a Muslim Ramani
 16veen shatee i
 ke antim charan main sambhavat: unka janm hua tha or 17veen shatee ke tritiy charan main kadachit unki mrityu hui
 He received the title of "panditraj" from the offerings of Sovereign Shri Shah Jahan
 kashmir ke rymukund ne unhen "asafvilas" likhane kaa aadesh diya tha
 He built it in the name of Nawab Asaf Khan
 isse jaan padataa he ki shahjahan or asaf khan ke saath ve kashmir bhi gaye the
 Panditraj Jagannath was a great poet, critic and scholar
 kavi ke rup main unka sthaan ucch kaati ke utkrisht kaviyon main kalidas ke ananthar- kuch vidvan rakhte hai
 Although he has not composed the epic, his liberation-poems and hymns appear to have evocative and sublime poetic style
 unki kavita main prasadgun ke saath-saath ajpradhan, samasbahula reeti bhi dikhaai detii he
 Fine verses of emotion, enchanting marking of images, rhyme of rhetoric, contextual and aesthetic appropriation of ornaments, euphoria and sense of dignity, and the creation of elegance in the collection of positions - are often ubiquitous in their poetry
 reetikalin alankaranpriyata or oohatmak kalpana kii udaan kaa bhi unpar prabhaav tha
 Both prose and verse - in his allegories, the use of excellent decoration style is found
 kalpanaaranjit hone par bhi unamem tathyamulak marmasparshita he
 His echoes echo the experience of life
 unke stotron main bhakthibhaav or shraddha kii drudh aasthaa se utpann bhavguruta or tanmayata mukherit he
 His classical interpretation reveals the seriousness of the scripture and the new talent
 sookshm vishleshan, gambhir manan-chintan or praudh paanditya, ke kaaran unka "rasgangadhar" apurna rahane par bhi sahityashastra ke utkrishtatam granthon main ek kaha jaataa he
 He was simultaneously a poet, litterateur and grammarian
 par "rasgangadhar" car ke rup main unke sahityashastreey paanditya or ukt granth kaa panditmandli main bada aadar he
 Drawing from the maturity of the book, litterateur Nagesh Bhatt wrote the commentary on "rasgangadhar"
 inke atirikt unke gadhy granth "yamunavarnan" kaa bhi "rasgangadhar" se sanket miltaa he
 The name "rasgangadhar" indicates that there would have been a plan for five "ananas" in this book
 paratu do ho "aanan" milte hai
 "chitramimamsakhandan" is also incomplete
 "kavyprakashtika" bhi prakashit hokar ab tak saamne nahin ai
 Baminivilas is his compilation of his most famous Muktak poems
 "nagesh bhatta" ke anusaar "rasangagadhar" ke lakshanon kaa udhaaharan dene ke liye pehle se hi isaki rachana hui thi
 It has four vilas, the first "proposed vilas" has very beautiful and fine expressions in it which is a nice and elegant revelation of life experience and knowledge

 Grand Canyon View from Grandview Point blue aavar, grand canyan The Shahnama or Shahnama is a Persian language epic composed by Firdosi
 isamen iran par arabi fatah ke purv ke shaskaon kaa charit likhaa gaya he
 This book presented in the court of Mahmud Ghazni of Khorasan was prepared by Firdausi in 1010 after 30 years of hard work
 isamen mukhaytah dohe hai, jo do mukhya bhaagon main vibhakt hai - mithkeey or aitihaasik saasaani shaskaon se mail khate
 Mahmud Ghaznavi is said to have pledged to Firdausi that he would give a dinar for every word of 'shahnama'
 varshon kii mehnat ke baad jab 'shahnamaa' taiyaar ho gaya or firdausi use lekar mahmud gazanabi ke darbar main gaya to samraat ne use prayek shabd ke liye ek dinar nahin balki ek dirham kaa bhugtan kara diya
 It is said that angry at this, Firdausi returned and did not even take a dirham
 yah vaayada kilaafi kuch aisi thi jaise kisi kavi ke prati shabd ek rupee dene kaa vachan dekar prati shabd ek paisa diya jaye
 Firdausi angrily wrote a few lines against Mahmud Ghaznabi
 ve panktiyaan itani prabhaavshaalee thi ki puure samrajya main fail gayin
 a few years later, his trusted ministers requested Mahmud Ghaznavi that Firdausi be paid at the same rate that was fixed
 samraat ke kaaran poochne par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ham log samrajya ke jis kone main jate hai hamen ve panktiyaan sunne ko milti hai jo firdausi ne aapke viruddh likhi hai or hamaara sirf shame se jhuk jaataa he
 If he is given money at the prescribed rate, then we will get a lot of moral strength
 ' samraat ne aadesh de diya
 When a car full of dinars reached Firdausi's house, Firdausi's funeral was coming out from inside the house
 puri umr garibi, tangi or mufalisi main kaatane ke baad firdausi mar chukaa tha
 It is said that his girl, the only child of Firdausi, refused to take this paddy
 is tarah samraat kavi kaa karjadaar rahaa or aaj bhi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Firdausi's Shahnama is as famous today or more famous as the lines that Firdausi wrote while criticizing Mahmud Ghaznabi
 firdausi kaa 'shahnamaa' darasal iran kaa itihaas hi nahin irani asmita kii pahchaan he
 It describes the achievements of ancient Iran
 samraaton kaa itihaas he
 The ancient Persian texts have been incorporated and given a new look
 myth or itihaas ke sammishran se ek adbhut prabhaav utpann hua he
 There are excellent examples of love, rebellion, valor, wickedness, humanism, war, courage that have made the 'shahnama' the immortal masterpiece of Iranian literature
 irani sahitya main 'shahnamaa' jitani tarah se jitani baar chapa he utana or koi pustak nahin chhapi he
 Firdausi has created characters like Rustom and Sohrab which have become part of human memory

 Modern scholars examining the original log book speculate that the light they saw was caused by a fire lit by the inhabitants of the Tenno to the kitchen in their canoes, problems with compasses caused by misreading a star's movements
