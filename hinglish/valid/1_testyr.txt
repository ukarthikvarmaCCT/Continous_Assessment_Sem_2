 ★ Parashar Sampradaya or Parasriya ideology is similar to that Ganga of thoughts, which reaches all the land of India by its nectar at its peak speed or destination, and in the intermittent rivers of many ideologies, it moves within itself
 atah 'parashar matt' ganganad he to anya vichaardhaaraein yaa matt nadiyaan hi he
 It is an uninterrupted, Sadanira river
 is drushti se dekhne par maharishi parashar kaa sthaan jaimini muni se unchaa hi siddh hota he
 We do not find the tradition of nourishment of Gemini Matt in the form of attu in later times
 jaimineey matt kii sabhi baaten parashar sampradaay main sarvatobhaven samahit ho gayi he, iskaa abhas parashrahorashastra ko dekhne se mil jaataa he
 ★ Acharyas like Varahamihira also bow down to the principles of Parashar
 ve apane granthon main bahut parashar matt kaa ullekh karke uskaa angikaran karte hai
 Therefore, the Parashar Sampradaya has been cultivated, flowered and flourished all over India and 'brihadparasharhorashastra' written by him is considered to be the final decisive text in the subject of astrology
 parashar, 'falit jyotish' ke aadhaar stambh hai isamen koi andeh nahi he
 ★ The period of Parashar is allowed to be around Mahabharata period
 kaliyug naamak kalkhand ke prarambh main hone ke kaaran uttarottar baliyastv ke siddhant se kaliyug main parashar matt kii sarvopari manyata spasht he
 ★ At one or two places in Kautilya's Arthashastra it is felt that the Vashistha and Pitamah doctrine was propagated at that time, so after assuming the time of Parashar after Narada, Vasistha, Pitamahadi astrologers, their existence seems to be in the beginning of Kali Yuga
 ★ parasharah kaa sristi tatv nirupan surya siddhant ke tadeey prakaran se mail khaataa he
 Hence Parashar existed around the event of the Mahabharata war, in the Puranic era, after the Vedic creation period, before the modern Matha from Panini, even before Chanakya, in the Puranic period
 ★ arthshaastra main parashar kaa namollekh paaya jaataa he
 Parasrasmriti shlokas are collected in Garuda Purana
 ★ brihadaaranyakopenishad va taittiriyaranyak main vyas va parashar ke naam aate hai
 ★ Yask also mentions the origin of Parashar in his ' # Nirukta'
 ye krishnadwaipayan vyas ke pita the tathaa inke pita kaa naam 'shakti' tha
 Varaha calls Parashar as Shaktiputra or Shakti East
 ★ agnipurana main spashtatya inhen shakti kaa putr hi kaha he
 This Parashar was fascinated by Matsyagandha Satyavati and Parashar son Krishnadvapayan Vyas was born from Satyavati's womb, it is well known
 ★ inhi parashar ne kaliyug main vyavastha banaaye rakhane ke liye 'parasharasmriti' yaa 'dwadashadhyaayi' dharmsamhita kii rachana kii thi
 Krite tu manavo dharmastrayatayein gautam: smritah
 dwapare shankhalikhitah kalau parasharah smritah
 ★ When Krishnadvapayan Vyas ji took some sages to his father Parashar located in Badarikashrama, Parashar gave him the knowledge of Varnashrama Dharma system
 ★ varah ne inhi shaktiputra parashar ko horashastra kaa pravaktaa bhi mana he
 Varahamihira is believed to have occurred in the fifth century
 atah prayek paristhiti main aaj se lagbhag 2000 varsh purv parashar ke samay kii nichali seemaa he
 ★ The conversation of Vidur and Maitreya is mentioned at one place in Srimad Bhagwat
 isse bhi # maitrey, # parashar va # mahabharat kii kadiyaan milti prathit hoti he
 Maharishi Parashar, who described Maitreya as Hora Shastra, was a sage who attained old age or fourth quarter in the Mahabharata period
 mahabharat kaa samay paramparaya kam se kam 3000 varsh purv mana jaataa he
 Hence Parashar took place in India 2-3 millennia ago
 ★ 'parashar tantra' kaa ullekh # bhattotpal ne anek sthanon par kiya he
 He has admitted to seeing and reading 'parashari Samhita' in the commentary of # Brihajatak
 'parashar tantra' naam se jo uddhran die gaye hai, unka vishay tantra arthath siddhant jyotish se kam va samhita se adhik mail khaataa he
 ★ Lord Brahma ji tells Narada ji- brahma ji bole - he naarad ! ab ham shivaji ke chhbbeeswein avatar kii katha kehete hai, tum man lagaakar suno
 ★ Twenty-sixth Avatar of Lord Shiva - chhbbeeswein dwapar main # parashar ne vyas kaa janm liya, jo hamaare # praputra the tathaa # shakti se utpann hue the

 After that, made eighteen Puranas, because the wisdom of earthly creatures was destroyed by the entry of Kali Yuga
 unhone veda kii reetiyaan yukti purvak puraanon main is prakaar mila di, jisase log prasann ho
 Just as a doctor does not give bitter medicine, sweet medicine makes the patient happy
 unhone anya vyaason kii apeksha jo ki pehle hue the, adhik achche puraana banaaye
 Although we and # Vyas made many kinds of efforts to make Vyasamatta famous but our efforts were fruitless and nobody read the Puranas
 tab # vyas_parashar ne chintit hokar shivaji kaa dhyaan kiya tathaa stuti karte hue unase kaha ki he prabho ! dwapar yug vyateet ho gaya tathaa kaliyug aa gaya
 Although i have revealed the intentions of the Vedas in the Puranas, but no one understands them due to the influence of Kali Yuga, the path of progress is increasing, but the end of Nibriti is coming to an end
 he prabho ! he bhaktavatsal ! kisi ne bhi puraanon ko nahin chhua, atah meraa matt prasiddh nahi hota isliye aap meri prarthana sunakar sahaayta kijiye tathaa mere dharm ko drudh kijiye
 You should increase my opinion by taking an avatar

 Once Vasisthan heard the sound of Vedhyayana, he was surprised because no one who was reciting Vedas was seen there
 tab adrishyanti ne unhen bataa diya ki shakti kaa putr mere garbh main he or usee ke vedadhyayan kii dhwani suni gayi he
 Vasistha was so pleased to hear that he gave up the desire for death
 janmoparant parashar ne sun liya ki rakshas kalmampaad ne unke pita shakti ko kha liya tha
 Hearing this, there was fierce opposition to demons in his mind and he decided to put an end to demons from the world
 is aashay se unhone apana rakshas-satr aarambh kiya jisamen rakshas marate ja rahe the
 When many demons were killed, Maharishi Pulastya went to Parashar after getting the permission of Niruti and prayed to complete the demon-session to save the demon dynasty
 unhone ahimsa kaa upadesh diya
 Vyas also explained to Parashar that it is improper to kill all demons without any blame, so you should complete your yagna because Bhushan of the sages is forgiven - pulasthya tathaa vyas ke sadupadeshon se prabhavit hokar parashar ne apana rakshas-satr purna kiya

 satyavati ko yojangandha hone kaa vardaan diya
 This Satyavati was later Shantanu's wife, from whose womb Chitrangad and Vichitravirya were born
 vichitraveery ne kashiraj-putree ambika tathaa ambalika ko byaaha, par vah nissantan mar gaya

 mahabharat 1,64,124-129 There have been two persons named Shaktaayana, one the grammarian of the last phase of the Vedic period, and the other the grammar of the 9th century reign of Amoghavarsha Nripatunga
 vaidic kaal ke antim charan ke shakatayan, sanskrit vyakaran ke rachayita he hai
 His works are no longer available but Yaksha, Panini and other Sanskrit grammars have given reference to his ideas
 shakatayan kaa vichaar tha ki sabhi sangya shabd antat: kisi na kisi dhaatu se vyutpann hai
 In Sanskrit grammar, this process is present as krit-suffix
 panini ne is mat ko sweekaar kiya kintu is vishay main koi aagrah nahin rakhaa or yah bhi kaha ki bahut se shabd aise bhi hai jo lok kii bolchaal main aa gaye hai or unase dhaatu pratyay kii pakad nahin kii ja sakati
 The grammar scripture composed by Shaktaayan may be 'ghatak Shastra', in which he also described the process of grammatical gender determination in conscious and unconscious constructions

 a map or geo-grid of latitudinal lines created by light or geometric methods to map a spherical earth or a large terrain of the earth on a flat surface is called map interpolation
 maanchitrkala ke antargat globe kii akshansh evam deshaantar rekhaon ko samtal dharaatal par sthanantarit karne kii vidhi ko maanchitr prakshep kehete hai
 The latitude and longitude lines drawn in this way are called "line traps"
 globe kii akshansh evam deshaantar rekhaon ko kisi samtal dharaatal par vishuddh rup se sthanantarit karnaa sambhav nahin, kyonki globe ke vakr dharaatal ko bina kisi ashuddhi ke samtal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In the early period of the development of projections, scholars tried to display heaven by obscure methods of projections
 sambhavat: sarvapratham prakshep kaa avishkaar thelj mahoday ne 600 i

 main kiya tha
 In fact, this nucleus was a silent projection, also called a birth chart
 vaastavik prakshep kaa avishkaar 300 i
 pus
 main sicily nivasee diakeresuj dwaara kiya gaya jisapar khinche maanchitr par sarvapratham akshansh rekha khinchi gai
 Eratosthenes, Ptolemy and Makenter's lifetimes have been important in the history of the development of interpolation
 taduparant satat rup se prakshepon kaa vikaas evam sanshodhan hota rahaa
 In order to move the latitude longitude lines of any map or any part of it, the globe is highlighted by covering it with a developable page or by placing a plane surface in a touching position at some point of the globe, and The shadow of type latitude longitude lines is projected
 is chaaya par hi sthaayee rekhaayen bana lee jaati hai
 The developable page is then cut and opened at a particular longitude
 inako jyamitiya athwa sandarsh prakshep kehete hai
 The above process is easily done with the help of a glass or wire globe
 sadaiv hi yah sambhav nahin ki uparyukt vidhi se prakshep banaae jaaen
 It is often required that interpolation is made with a particular goal in which the geometric or perspective method has to be disregarded and the latitude and longitude lines are drawn on the paper without projecting any shadows based on the principles of mathematics and calculations
 inako ajyamitiya athwa asandarsh prakshep kehete hai
 They are more useful
 upyog kii drushti se maanchitr kii teen visheshtaayen hoti hai : samakshetrafal, yathaakrit tathaa shuddh disha
 These three characteristics cannot be obtained purely on any simultaneous projection
 prayek prakshep par inamen se kisi na kisi visheshta kaa abhaav rahata he
 The names of the projections holding these characteristics in pure form are as follows: samakshetrafal prakshep : in prakshepon ke rekhajaal par bane hue akshansh deshaantareey chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal globe par pradarshit honevaale sangati chaturbhuj ke kshetrafal se maapkanupaat main samaan hota he kintu in prakshepon ke rekhajaal par khinche hue maanchitron kii akruti bhang ho jaati he
 Natural projection: The shape of the maps drawn on these projections is pure
 akruti ko shuddh rakhane ke hetu akshansh or deshaantar rekhaon kaa paraspar lambavat hona aavashyak he or kisi bhi ek bindu par maapak samast dishaao main samaan hota he
 But the scale varies from one point to another
 vastav main purna rup se akruti shuddh rakhana sambhav nahin he
 Only in small areas can the shape be almost right
 visheshkar binduon par hi purna roopen akruti shuddh rahati he
 Equilateral interpolation: The directions of the maps marked on the projections are pure
 maanchitr ke centrebindu se chaaron ore kii dishaaen usee prakaar hoti hai, jaise prithvi par
 If this center is a pole, the longitude lines represent pure directions
 yah prakshep navikon ke adhik upyog main aate hai
 Segmentation based on a developable page is considered more authoritative
 iske antargat prakshepon ke nimnlikhit chaar samooh hai : The globe is covered by a cone in such a way that the cone touches the globe at any one latitude
 parantu dhruv evam vishuvat rekha par shanku kaa sparsh karnaa sambhav nahin, kyonki ye visham paristhitiyaan hai
 The shadow of latitude longitude lines is obtained on the conical plane after lighting the globe with a glowing point
 in chhayarekhaon ko sthaayee banaakar shanku ko kisi abhisht deshaantar par kaat diya jaataa he or is prakaar samtal dharaatal par rekhajaal praapt kar liya jaataa he jisamen akshansh rekhaayen chaap rup hoti hai or deshaantar rekhaayen shanku ke sheershabindu par milanevaali saral rekhaayen hoti he
 The latitude at which the cone touches the globe is called "standard latitude"
 shanku ko kisi anya laghu vrutt par bhi sparsh karaayaa ja saktaa he
 But if the top of the cone is not above the pole, the latitude lines will not be in arc form nor the longitude lines will be in arc form
 is jyamittiya vidhi ke atirikt shanku prakshep ajyamitiya dhang se bhi praapt kiye jate hai
 The globe is covered by the cylinder in such a way that the cylinder touches the globe around the equator
 ab kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daalkar rekhajaal prakshipt kiya jaataa he
 Thereafter, the cylinder is cut open at a particular longitude and thus a rectangular graticule is formed on the plane plane
 is vidhi ke antargat globe ke centre kii dhyutimaan bindu maanate hai
 The longitude lines thus obtained are simple lines drawn from north to south whose length is equal to the equatorial line
 in prakshepon main globe ke centre ko yadi dhyutimaan bindu mana jaataa he to akshansh rekhaon ke bich kii duuri dhruvon kii ore ek saath badhati jaati he
 The cylinder can also be touched on any other large circle without touching the equator, but in such a drawn line the latitude and longitude lines will curve
 belanaakaar prekshepon main dhruv kaa pradarshan nahin ho paata, kyonki belan kaa dharaatal dhruv aksh ke samaantar hone ke kaaran dhruv kii chaaya anyatra pad jaati he or belan ke dharaatal par nahin aati
 In these projections, reflection is taken only on the plane plane
 yah dharaatal globe ko kisi ek bindu par sparsh karata he or is avasthaa main kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daal kar rekhajaal praapt kiya jaataa he
 The following are the different names of the mean projections based on the position of the dashed point: khamadhya prakshepon kii vidhiyon main samtal dharaatal ko yadi ek dhruv par sparsh karata hua rakhte hai to aise prakshep dhruviya khamadhya prakshep kehalaate hai, yadi samtal dharaatal vishuvat rekha ke kisi bindu par globe ko sparsh karata he to aise prakshep vishuvatrekhiy khamadhya prakshep kehalaate hai
 In addition, if the plane touches the ground globe at some point between the pole and the equator, then this type of interpolation is called oblique end projection
 dhyutimaan bindu kii uparyukt sthiti ke aadhaar par bhi prakshepon kaa namakaran hota he jaise cendrak, lambavat evam tiryak prakshep
 It is clear from the above description that cylindrical and oblique interpolations are odd forms of cone interpolation
 shanku yadi bahut lanbaa he ore brihat vrutt ko sparsh kar saktaa he to shanku belan kaa rup dhaaran kar legaa
 In addition, if the cone becomes very flat, it will touch the globe only at one point
 is avasthaa main yah khamadhya prakshep ho jaayga
 The trajectories of the three groups written above are drawn by both geometric and non-geometric methods
 ajyamitiya athwa asandarsh varg ke prakshep hai, kyonki inako ganit ke siddhant or tatsambandhi gananaaon ke aadhaar par bina pratibimb daale hue khinchaa jaataa he
 This is done only for the fulfillment of a particular purpose
 yadhyapi inkaa nirmaan saral nahin, phir bhi inkaa upyog anya prakaar ke prakshepon kii apeksha atyadhik he or in prakshepon par visheshkar sampurna sansa kaa maanchitr khinchaa jaataa he
 a certain structure based on time in music is called a rhythm
 shastreey sangeet main taal kaa badi ahm bhoomika hoti he
 Tabla, mridang, dhol and manjir etc
 are used to give rhythm to music
 pracheen bhartiya sangeet main mrudang, ghatm ityadi kaa prayog hota he
 Tabla is most popular in modern Hindustani music
