 Keruac was impressed with Snyder and they were close for a number of years
 1955 ke vasant main ve snidar ke mil vaili cabin main ek saath rahete the
 Most beats were urban and they found Snyder almost foreign, with his rural background and wilderness experience, as well as his education in cultural anthropology and Oriental languages

" The "primitive social practices" were blinding and directionless disappearance

 His reasoning was that this ideology of Beats promotes criminal practices in the society
 beats ke sadasyon par lagaae gaye aaropon main se ek tha ki, ve "jivan" va "sahitya" ke bich ke antar ko samaapt karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 In response to this, Ginsberg said in a 1958 documentary "the Village Vice", "we are being accused of a hollow allegation of intellectual disharmony
" hamane bhi in tikaakaron kii bhanti unhi shaalaaon main vidya pai jaha buddha jivi bhi hote the
 Podhoretz is also rooted in the literature of eighteenth century in the twentieth century, so his outlook is backward

 The conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented in the form of a book called Bhagavad Gita
 kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 Of all Hindu texts, the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is considered the most important
 kyonki isamen ek vyakti ke jivan kaa saar he or isamen mahabharat kaal se dwapar tak krishna ke sabhi lilao kaa varnan hai

 ye sab mul kahani ko hi darshaate he hai lekin unki visheshtaon, vivaran or shaileyon main kaaphi bhinnata hai
 The most original work, Harivansh, is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna's life as a poor cowboy, but infused with poetic and supernatural imagination
 yah krishna kii mrityu ke saath samaapt nahin hoti
 According to some accounts, the fifth book of Vishnu Purana breaks away from the realism of Harivamsa and covers Krishna in mystical words and stanzas
many versions of the manuscripts of Vishnu Purana exist
 bhagwat puraana kii dasvin or gyarahavin pustakon ko vyapak rup se ek kavishtha kriti mana jaataa he, jo ki kalpana or rupakon se bharaa hua he, harivansh main paye jane vaale jeevon ke yatharthwaad se koi sambandh nahin he

 9veen shatabdi se jain parampara main maananaa he kii neminath 84,000 varsh pehle paidaa hue
 "guy Beck" states that Krishna - whether human or divine avatar - refers to the real person in ancient India, who lived at least 1000 BCE, but from this historical evidence, purely from the study of Sanskrit doctrine, it Cannot be replaced

 isamen 10 ank he
 Its creator is Maharaj Shudraka
 naatak kii prishtabhumi patliputra he
 According to Bharata, it is the best example of 'mishra Case' out of ten forms
 ‘mrichhakaticum’ naatak iskaa pramaan he ki antim aadmi ko sahitya main jagah dene kii parampara bharat ko viraasat main mili he jahaan chor, ganika, garib brahman, daasi, nai jaise log dusht raja kii satta palat kar ganraajya sthapit kar antim aadmi se naayakatv ko praapt hote hai
 The story of Mritchkatikam is enlivened by the poet's genius
 ujjayini kaa nivasee saarthwah vipravar charudutt is prakaran kaa nayak he or dakhnita ke kul main utpann vasantsena nayika he
 Chaudutt's wife Dhuta is the firstborn according to the predecessor whereby Chaudutt has a son named Rohitsen
 charudutt kisi samay bahut samrudh tha parantu vah apane dayaa dakshinya ke ke kaaran nirdhan ho chalaa tha, tathaapi pramanikta, saujany evam audaarya ke naate uski mahati pratishtha thi
 Vasantasena is the beauty of the city, extremely generous, intelligent and tactful, Roopgunasampanna Sadharani, the new-born heroine is of an excellent nature and loves Nirvizha, who is enchanted by her extraordinary qualities
 nayak kii yon ek saadhaarani or ek swiya nayika hone ke kaaran yah sankeern prakaran mana jaataa he
 Its plot fully represents the society of the day
 yah keval vyaktigat vishay par hi nahin apitu is yug kii shashan vyavastha evam rajya sthiti par bhi prachur prakaash daalata he
 At the same time, he also portrays a consistent picture of civilian life
 isamen nagar kii saaj-sajaavat, vaaranganaon kaa vyavhaar, das pratha, dyut krida, vit kii dhoortta, chaurkarm, nyaayalay main nyayanirnay kii vyavastha, avaanchit raja ke prati praja ke droh, evam janamat ke prabhutv kaa saamaajik swaroop bhalee bhanti chitrit kiya gaya he
 Also, the status of the poor in society, the honor of virtues, the gratification of the harmony of equal friendship, the gratitude of the obliged class, the anger at the punishment for the innocent, the tyranny of the Raj Vallabh, the prosperity and generosity of Varnari, the sacrifice on the altar of love , Personal subjects such as the ideal character of the Kulanganas have also been highlighted
 is visheshata ke kaaran yah yathrthwaadee rachana sanskrit sahitya main anuthi he
 For this reason, it became very dear to Western gentlemen
 iskaa anuwaad vividh bhashaaon main ho chukaa he or bharat tathaa sudur america, rus, france, germany, italy, england ke anek rangamanchon par iskaa safal abhinay bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 Ujjayini is the center of the story of 'mritchkatik'
 vah itnaa bada nagar he ki patliputra kaa samvahak uski prasiddhi sunakar basane ko, dhandha praapt karne ko, aata he
 We find a society of Chaturvarnya in it - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras
 brahmanon kaa mukhya kaam purohitai tha, par ve rajkaaj main bhi dilchaspee lete the
 a very serious thing which is found in this story is that here Brahmins, merchants and inferior people together overthrow the Madanand Kshatriya kingdom
 yah dhyaan dene yogya baat he
 And then it is a matter of thinking that the author of this story is considered to be King Shudraka, who is said to be superior among the Kshatriyas
 mrichctic main das ank hai, prayek ank main kai drushya hai
 The play has the story of a true but poor Brahmin Charudatta who is loved by Vandantasena, a beauty queen
 isi ke saath aryak kii rajyaprapti kii raajnneetik katha bhi gunthi hui he
 Kritikar has skillfully combined the two stories
 yah naatak mote taur par do hisson main hai- pehla, vasantsena or charudatt kaa prem-prasang tathaa doosraa, rajya vidroh ke saath aryak ko rajpad kii prapti
 First issue: There is a story in this issue that the king's brother-in-law wants to get Vasantasena, the famous courtesan of Ujjayini
 apane do saathiyon ke saath ek andheri raat main vah vasantsena kaa peechha karata he
 The terrified Vasantasena takes Sharan at Charudatta's house
 choron se bachane kii baat kahkar vah apane saare swarna-aabhushan charudatt ke ghar main dharohar ke rup main chhod detii he
 Number two: The conductor, who was previously in the service of Charudatta, loses a lot of money due to gambling addiction
 bachaav ke liye vah vasantsena ke ghar shaaran letaa he, jo apana kangan dekar use rinmukt karti he
 He becomes a Buddhist-monk
 teesraa ank : sharvilak naam kaa brahman vasantsena kii daasi madnika se prem karata he
 To free him from slavery, he breaks into Charudatta's house one night and steals all the gold jewelery kept by Vasantasena
 udhar charudatt kii pativrata patni dhoota apane pati ko lokaninda se bachaane ke liye, churaae gaye aabhushaanon ke badale main apni keemtee ratnavali detii he, charudatt vah ratnavali dekar vidooshak maitrey ko vasantsena ke ghar bhejtaa he
 Fourth issue: Sharvilak arrives at Vasantasena's house to take Madanika free from slavery by taking stolen stolen clothes
 chori kii baat sunakar madnika bahut dukhi hoti he
 In the spirit of correcting this mistake, she convinces Sharvilak that by handing over stolen robes to Vasantasena, he will not remain a thief, nor will there be a loan on the head of Charudutt and he will get Vasantasena's jewelery back, Sharvilak does so
 vah vasantsena se kahata he ki charudatt ne yah sandesh bheja he ki ghar jarjar hone se ham swarnapaatr ko surakshit nahin rakh sakate, atah aap ise apane paas rakhen
 Vasantasena hands Madanika to Sharvilak, asking him to take something in exchange for the message
 isi ank main vidooshak vasantsena se milakar kahata he ki swarnapaatr jue main haar gaye hai isliye yah ratnavali sweekaar karen
 Vasantasena knows the reality, but does nothing
 vah shaam ko charudatt ke ghar aane kaa nishchay karti he
 Fifth issue: This season describes the rainy season
 vasantsena charudatt se milti he or varsha kii jhadi ke kaaran raat usee ke ghar ruk jaati he
 Sixth Point: In the morning, Charudatta goes for a walk in the Pushparkandak garden, with the promise of keeping the car ready for Vasantasena so that he can travel to the park there
 yaheen vasantsena charudatt ke putr rohsen ko yah jid karte dekhati he ki vah mitti kii gaadi se nahin swarna-shakatic se khelnaa chahta he
 Vasantasena puts all the clothes in a clay cart and says that to make a gold car from it
 vasantsena charudatt se udyaan main bhent karne nikalati he, par bhul se usee sthaan par khadi shaakaar kii gaadi main baith jaati he
 Meanwhile, Gawale's son Aryak, who breaks the prison and runs out after killing the guard, gets into Chaudutt's vehicle for rescue
 raste main do police ke sipaahi- virak or chandanak vaahan dekhte bhi hai, par unamem se ek aryak ko raksha karne kaa vachan dekar jane detaa he
 Seventh issue: Aryak named Aryak, who believed that King Palak believed in the prophecy of the Siddhas, was imprisoned when he broke the bond and climbed into the car of Charudatta and came in front of Chaudatta in the garden and asked for his protection
 charudatt use surakshit apni gaadi main baahar nikalava detaa he
 Eighth issue: When Vasantasena, who was sitting in a carriage of Shakara by mistake, reaches the garden, he is confronted by the evil Shakar in place of Charudatta
 vasantsena ek baar phir shaakaar ke changul main fas jaati he, shaakaar kaa aagrah na maanane par vah vasantsena kaa galaa ghont detaa he or use mara jaanakar patton se dhak kar chalaa jaataa he
 That is why the conductor, who has become a Buddhist-monk from the gambler, brings life back to Vasantasena, the deceased
 navaan ank : shaakaar charudatt ko vasantsena kii hatya kaa aaropee banaata he
 Controversy goes on in court, Charudatta is unable to prove himself innocent
 dukhi charudatt apane mitra maitrey kii pratiksha karata he, jo vasantsena ke paas un aabhushanon ko lautaane gaya tha jo vasantsena ne rohsen kii mitti kii gaadi ke sthaan par sone kii gaadi bana lene ko de die the
 Maitreya arrives at the same moment with the same ornament
 kintu baatcheet karte hue maitrey se bagal main sanbhale hue ve aabhushan sabake saamne gir padate hai or yah maan liya jaataa he ki aabhushanon ke lobh main charudatt ne hi vasantsena kii hatya kii he
 He is ordered to death and taken to the slaughter
 dasavaan ank : is ank main ek to shaakaar kaa sevak sthvarak charudatt ko nirdosh bataata he, par uskaa koi vishwaas nahin karata
 At the same time, Vasantasena expresses the wickedness of Shakara by coming with a vampire who has become a Buddhist-monk who saves his life and Charudatta is freed from false accusation
 idhar rajya main nae raja aryak kaa aagaman hota he, vah na keval aarope mukt charudatt ko rajya detaa he, balki jhootha aarope lagane ke kaaran shaakaar ko mrityu-dand bhi detaa he
 But Shakar is also forgiven at the behest of Charudatta
 pativrata dhoota charudatt ke liye mrityu-dand kaa samachar sunakar agni-pravesh ko tatpar ho uthati he, charudatt upasthit hokar is dukhad ghatana ko roktaa he
 King Aryak pleases Vasantasena with the title of 'bride'
 bhikshu samvahak ko sab viharon kaa kulapati bana diya jaataa he
 The slave settler is freed from slavery, the chanters who give death penalty are made the chiefs of the chandalas, even the shakaras are given tribute
 in sukhad ghatnaon ke saath naatak samaapt hota he
 Not only is the story of Mruthaktik very interesting, but the character of the poet's characterization is very high
 yadhyapi isamen pradhan ras vipralambh shringaar he tathaapi hasya, karuna, bhayanak evam vatsalya jaise hridayahari vividh rason kaa sahaj saamanjasy he
 Its value has also been judged very much by Western mystics when tested from the point of view of Greek theater
 isaki bhashaa prasad gun se sampann ho atyant pranjal he
 The philosophy of the various forms of Prakrit is seen in it- In addition to Oriya, Magadhi and Shaurseni, the best examples of Prakrit Maharashtri and Avanti are available here
 grearsan ke anusaar is prakaran main shaakaari vibhaasha main takki praakrit kaa bhi prayog paaya jaataa he
 The poet has given special attention to Madhuri and Arthayavakthi in Shabchayan, due to which the Avanti and Vaidarbhi customs have been completely fulfilled
 mrichctic main do kathaayen hai
 One is Chauduttatta, the other is Aryak
 gunanty kii brihatkatha main gopal darak aryak ke vidroh kii katha he
 Brihatkha was written in its original form in the Paischi language under the name of 'baddakha'
 isse prakat hota he ki yah naatak isvi pehali shatee yaa duusari shatee kaa he
 This drama holds its special place in Sanskrit literature
 isamen– These are its characteristics
 is naatak kii raajnneetik visheshta yah he ki isamen kshatriya raja bura bataaya gaya he
 gop-putra 'aryak' is a cowherd, whom the poet makes a king
 yadhyapi kavi varnashram ko maanata he, par vah gop ko hi raja banaata he
 It seems that this story is old and possibly this incident is some real event which has remained in the legend
 daspratha ke ladkadhaate samaaj kaa chithran bahut sundar hua he or yah hamen chanakya ke samay main miltaa he, jab ‘arya’ shabd ‘naagarik’ ke rup main prayukt miltaa he
 Some old legend may have descended into this legend in the later period of Chanakya
 buddha ke samay main vyapaariyon kaa utkarsh bhi kaaphi hua tha
 Then Ujjayini's kingdom was different, Kosala's separate
 yahan bhi ujjayini kaa varnan he
 At one point it seems that there was a feeling of unity of India even when it is said that 'aryak has conquered the whole earth' - the earth whose Kailas flag is
 dekha jaae to kavi yathartwaadee tha or nishpaksh tha
 He has shown the good and evils of all and has depicted it very deeply
 yahi uski safalataa kaa kaaran he
 It is considered to be the work of Maharaja Shudraka who, like Bhasa and Kalidas, has become a king poet
 mrichctic isvi pratham shatee ke lagbhag kii rachana kahi ja sakati he
 It is said that Bhasparnit 'charudatta' has been modified by adding a story of a Chaturangi metaphor by a later Shudra poet
 vastut: isaki kathavstu kaa aadhaar brihatkatha or kathasaritsagar main varnit kathaon main miltaa he
 Ujjayini is the center of the story of 'mritchkatik'
 vah itnaa bada nagar he ki patliputra kaa samvahak uski prasiddhi sunakar basane ko, dhandha praapt karne ko, aata he
 At that time he does not call Pataliputra a metropolis
 iskaa matlab he ki us samay patliputra se adhik mahatv ujjayini kaa tha
 Apparently Pataliputra was Pataliputra in Buddha's time, while Mahasen Chand at Ujjayini was a prosperous kingdom of Pradyot
 duusari pracheenta he ki isamen das pratha bahut he
 The slave-maids were freed by giving money
 us samaaj main ganika bhi vadhoo ban jaati thi
 All these things belong to a society where there is no strictness, which started later
 balki kavi ne ganika ko vadhoo banaakar samaaj main ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he
 There is a sense of rebellion in him
 atyaachaari ko vah pashu kii tarah maravaata he, stri ko unchaa uthaata tathaa das sthaavarak ko azaad karata he
 It can be said that this drama, which is an episode in classical terms - is very important
 koun jaanata he, aise na jane kitne saamaajik naatak kaal ke gaal main kho gaye
 The Holocausts from the Huns to the Turks did not know how many texts and stones were burnt! mrichctic par anek tikaayen likhi gai
 There have been many translations of this and several editions have also been published
 unamem se sarvapracheen tikaa prithvidhar kii he
 Jivananda also wrote a comprehensive commentary
 haridas kii vyakhya atyant maarmik he
 Its English translation by Arthur Ryder has been published in the Harvard University Series
 sanyoji uttak reshedaar uttak hote hai
 The main component of the connective tissues of beings is a protein called collagen
 sanyoji utak maanav sharir main ek ang ko duusare ang se jodne kaa kaary karata he
 It is found in every organ
 yahutakon kaa ek vistrut samooh he
 The specific function of connective tissues is to make connections, cover the organs and keep them in the right place

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 According to a custom, Allah’s Rasul has said that "I am the best speaking Arab, so i was born in Quraysh and grew up in Saad"
 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia
