 swami ne twit karke kaha ki muslim sarayu nadi paar musjid kaa unka prastaav maan len, anyathaa 2018 main rajyasabha main bhaajapa kaa bahumat hoga or tab kanoon banaakar ram mandir banane kaa rasta saaf kar diya jayega
 On this matter, Asaduddin Owaisi said that Subramaniam Swamy was telling lies
 maamla jab court main he to aap yani swami kuch nahin kar sakate hai
 Modi government will go to court and say that if we hear every day, then the solution can be found
 swami dhamkee den rahe hai
 According to them, either listen to us or else we will work on this issue, they are scared
 hindu raashtra banane kii koshish kar rahe hai or musalamaanon ko doum darje kaa shahari banane kaa prayaas he
 Owaisi said the law is the largest
 wo swami or modi se bada he
 Owaisi said that India does not follow anyone's faith
 kaha ki swami ji pradhanmantri narendra modi ke paas jaaen or unase kahen ki jis tarahasupreme courtgharmiyon kii chhuttiyon main baithkar tripal talaak par sunwaayee karegaa
 Along with that, this issue should be heard every day
 swami ne kal ajtak se baatcheet main kaha tha ki saudi arab jaise muslim desh main rojaanaa sadaken or apartment banane ke liye masjiden todi jaati hai

 haalanki is baat kii pushti abhi nahin ho pai he
 Leander Paes, Rohan Bopanna and Somdev Devvarman - All three tennis stars did not participate for India in the Incheon Asian Games, but at the same time preferred to play in the ATP tournament
 ab is maamle ko khel mantralay ne gambhirtha se liya he, or in khilaadiyon kaa naam liye bina saaf kaha he ki agar athleton ko sarkari anudaan chahie to unhen desh ke liye khelnaa hoga
 This move of the government has also been supported by the Indian Olympic Association
 bhartiya olympics sangh ke adhyaksh en ramchandran ne bhi sarkaar se sur milaate hue kaha he ki sarkari anudaan ke chalate hi khilaadi antarrashtriya toornament main hissaa le pate hai, isliye asian khelon or olympics khelon main hissaa lene se inkaar karnaa thik baat nahin he
 Leander Paes, Rohan Bopanna and Somdev Devvarman - all three have always said that they had to play in the ATP tournament to get rating points
 vaise bhi, olympics, 2012 ke baad se tennis khilaadiyon ko sarkaar kii ore se koi anudaan nahin mila he, lekin har bade toornament se pehle sarkaar se khel sanghon ko baari-bharkam rakam di jaati he
 From this perspective, the government's decision may be strict, but it is in the national interest
 desh ke tamaam khel sitaron ko ise maanane main sankoch nahin hona chahie
 Players like the world's famous professional stars Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have also been playing for their country
 vaise, is puure maamle main ek baat to saaf he ki bharat ke tennis khilaadiyon ne deshhit par paison ko tarjeeh nahin di, kyonki agar unamem paison kaa laalach hota to asian khelon main hi hissaa lene jate
 The medals showed more interest in winning the prize, as the tournaments they went to participate in were extremely low-paid tournaments, so in this case, the players have really preferred to improve their rankings and points
 udhar, tennis khilaadiyon ke alaava akhil bhartiya tennis sangh kii manyata bhi khatre main he
 If the Sangh does not conduct its elections as per the government guidelines, then their difficulties may increase
 jaahir he, ab khel mantralay, sangh or khilaadiyon ko riyaayat dene ke mood main nahin he
 In such a situation, it would be better that players do better planning for professional tournaments and tournaments played for the country, and on the other hand, the government also needs to give timely grants to these players, only then in improving the picture of the game in India

 board ke sadsy sabhi vidhayak, saansad, revenue, field irigation or vikaas vibhaag ke adhikari banaaye gaye the
 The Board reserves the right to construct Chaupal in villages, which was not possible before

 The government was also troubled in the matter and a statement was made about the purchase of electric buses in a hurry

 Or maybe it is a Guwahati goon who rapes her hands and remembers having to smile in front of the camera
 yaa shaayad vah ghatnasthal kaa niskriy darshak he jo dekhtaa he ki kya ho rahaa he or is baat par hairaan hota he ki jab krur purush baari-baari se ek mahila ke kapade faad rahe hai, or uske stanon ko dabaa rahe hai, tab us niraashajanak sthiti main vah mahila apane aapako kaise bachaati he

 To be an Indian woman requires sacrifice, suffering and silence

 Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI is embarking on a new conspiracy against India after being blown away by an air strike on the border
 ajtak ko khufia sutron ne jaankaree di he ki pakistan kii khufia agency iesai nepal kii sena main chupchaap nae tareeke se ghuspaith karne kii koshish main lagi hui he
 For this, Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and its army are building National Defense College in Nepal's capital Kathmandu
 china kii tarj par pakistan nepal se nazadiiki badhaane kii koshishon main laga hua he taaki wo nepal main bharat ke prabhaav ko kam kar sake
 According to security department sources, Pakistan wants to build a National Defense College in Kathmandu so that it can strengthen its penetration in the Nepal Army
 khufia agenciyon ke mutabik pakistan, nepal main neshnal dephence college bananaa chahta he vahiin kathmandu main sthit paak hai kamishan anti india propagenda bhi chalaa rahaa he
 According to an official associated with the security agency, several rounds of meetings have been held between Pakistan and Nepal to build a National Defense College in the last few days
 pakistan pichley kuch varshon main nepal ke saath apane rishton ko lagaataar majboot karne main laga hua he, jisase wo bharat ke prabhaav ko kam kar sake
 Recently, an intelligence report said that Pakistan is engaged in helping anti-india and terrorist groups in Nepal, so that the terrorists can take advantage of the open border of Nepal and India and enter India
 sabase pehle ajtak ne pichley saal agast ke maheene main khulaasa kiya tha ki kis tareeke se nepal ke jariye aatanki modul ko paalane kaa kaam pakistan khufia agency lagaataar kar rahi he
 According to intelligence sources, Maulana Omar Madani, a suspected lashkar-e-taiba suspect in Nepal's Morang district, is trying to spread anti-india activities by building a new module
 khufia sutron ne 'ajtak' ko jaankaree di he ki moulana madani, lashkar-e-taiyaba se judaa he or wo nepal ajukational and welfare sosayadi ke jariye bharat virdohi gatividhiyon ko dhadlle se failaa rahaa he
 The report given by the intelligence agency to the Ministry of Home Affairs says that Maulana Madani is seeking funds from abroad through his NGO in some Nepal districts bordering the border
 is fund kaa istemaal wo border aria main rahane vaale bhole-bhaale yuvaaon kaa brinwash kar lashkar main shaamil karne ke liye kar rahaa he
 Intelligence agencies have also pointed out how foreign money is coming from Nepal route to Nepal's NGO
 is enjio kaa istemaal madani muslim yuvaaon ko lashkar main shaamil karne ke liye kar rahaa he
 Not only this, there has also been a report that money is coming from Qatar via Nepal, which is being used for wrong activities by giving clerics of mosques on the border of India
 aapako bataa den ki aatankwaad ko panaah dene vaale pakistan ke liye 1751 kimi tak khuli bharat- nepal kii seemaa sabase laabhakaari rahi he
 This is the reason that the dreaded terrorists prefer this route more than Bagha or other borders
 haalanki esasabi is border kii suraksha main rahati he or kai baar usne ghuspaith ke dauraan kai aatankiyon ko pakadaa bhi he

" '' pradhanmantri ne kaha ki yah bajet janabhagidaari or janashakti ko badhaava degaa
 This budget is an effort to make India efficient and digital with the use of modern technology
 modi ne kaha ki vikaas ko 'samaveshak, sarvadeshak or sarvasparshi' hona chahie or ise desh ke un kshetron tak pahunchnaa chahie jo abhi tak aviksit hai
 The Prime Minister said that despite difficult times, the government is committed to provide all possible help to the poor, neo-middle class and middle class with the mantra of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 modi ne samprag sarkaar ke pichley ek dashak main arthvyavastha ke halaat kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha ki is dauraan puri arthvyavastha charmara gai jisaki vajah se na keval bharat balki duniya ne ummid chhod di thi or niraashaa kaa maahaul tha
 He assured the people of India that the government will leave no stone unturned in the development of India and freeing the country from these challenges
 nai sarkaar ke prayaason kaa zikr karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, ''jab hamane sarkaar banaai to is tarah kii charchaaen ho raheen thim ki kya yah sarkaar desh ko sankat se mukt kara paaegi, lekin pehle railway bajet or aaj is aam bajet ne dikhaa diya he ki ham sahi disha main aage bad rahe hai

 Cartoon is an art called gestures
 yah yaa to apane lakshya par sidhe taur tikhaa hamalaa karata he yaa vishay kii kamajoriyon yaa khaamiyon ko maanya tareeke se ujagar karata he, jo darshakon ko gudgudaata he
 Rasipuram Krishnaswamy Lakshmana alias Ar
 ke
 Laxman was an eccentric cartoonist who specializes in this second art
 1951 main cartoon bananaa shuru karne se lekar aadhi sadi se adhik samay tak ve bharat ke badlaav ko darj karte rahe
 His basic principle was, "my sketchpen is not a sword
" yah meri dost he
 "A well-known common man with a worn-out mustache, dressed in a shabby and worn-out old dhoti and holding an umbrella in his hand, has become the mark of every Indian
" lakshmana bhale hi buddhijiviyon ke adarsh yaa anpadhon kaa manoranjan karne vaale na rahe hon lekin ve har us bhartiya ke saathi the jo samaajwaad kii sanak or aarthik sudhaar kii lahar se guzar rahaa tha
 The famous British cartoonist David Lowe once said that he used to draw lines with vinegar, not acid
 lakshmana tasviir ke rup main sirke kaa bhi ras nikaalnaa jaanate the
 In 1960, Shankar, the first great cartoonist of India, was coming to an end
 lakshmana ne unki viraasat ko sambhala
 He destroyed the hypocrisy of politics and government with his strikes
 unhone kisi ko aahat nahin kiya, lekin antaratma ko jhakzora
 He did not offend the leaders, but created a ruckus among them
 unhone logon ko gussa nahin dilaayaa, balki unhen sochane ke liye vivash kiya
 Laxman's satire shook all classes and societies
 aam aadmi ke sarokaaron ke saath unhone puure bharat ko vah samay dekhne ke liye vivash kiya, jo ve apni najar se dekhte the
 The eighties, when i started making cartoons, was a time of great creative energy for cartoons in India
 lekin print patrakarita main lakshmana kaa dabadabaa tha
 His pocket cartoon 'you Sed It' was very satirical
 unhone bharat ko ek najariya diya ki use kaisaa hona chahie—ek desh jo apni andhi aasthaa or masakharepan vaali naapsandgi ke saath baadhaon ko paar kar rahaa tha
 They were laughing at people by exposing the weaknesses of leaders who were human beings, not gods, with their cartoons
 yahi baat unhen sabase alag banaati he
 This is what makes them evergreen

 Hosts opener Gautam Gambhir is hopeful that his senior partner Zaheer Khan will perform better against England in the third cricket Test as he knows the art better, after James Anderson upset India with a reverse swing
 anderson ne chaay ke lagaataar reverse swing hasil karke bhartiya ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya
 England took three wickets in the final session, helping India to 273 for seven on the first day
 gambhir ne pehle din kaa khel samaapt hone ke baad kaha, ‘‘hamaare paas jahir or ishanth he jo gend ko kaaphi acchhee tarah reverse swing kar sakate hai
 If they are in rhythm then England will also face a lot of trouble
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘jahir khan ko reverse swing main maharath hasil hai
 If he gets into rhythm, i think it's a matter of concern for England
 ummid karata hum ki jahir or ishanth hamaare liye acha kaam karenge or bharat ke liye badi bhoomika nibhaayenge
 This is a wicket that has something for everyone
 ’’ Praising Anderson (three wickets for 68 runs), Gambhir said that the England fast bowler was hiding the ball very well and he dismissed Sachin Tendulkar and Ravichandran Ashwin through reverse swing
 gambhir ne kaha, ‘‘usne kamjor gend nahin phenki
 The ball was doing the reverse and he hid the ball from the bright side
 agar koi gendbaaj gend kii chamak kaa chhipaata he to aapke liye kaaphi mushkil ho jaataa he kyonki aap dekh nahin pate ki gend kii chamak kis tarah he or yah kis taraf move karegi
 Finally you have to play the ball late
 ’’ The Indian opener said that the match is still at par and if India manages to score more than 330 tomorrow then it will be a good match
 tippaniyan He said, "I think we lost two wickets more
 aswin jis tarah ballebaaji kar rahaa tha, ham kuch or der tak ise aage badha sakate the
 It was an equal day
 main yah nahin kahuunga ki yah england ke paksh main rahaa
 If we were able to score 330 to 350, it would be a good match
 ’’ Gambhir admitted that Virender Sehwag's run out on a personal score of 23 was disappointing from the team's point of view
 sahvaag or gambhir ne bharat ko acchhee shuruuaat dilaate hue sirf 10 over main team kaa score 47 ran tak pahunchaa diya tha jiske baad sahvaag ran out ho gaye
 Anderson troubled the Indian batsmen by getting a frequent reverse swing of tea
 england ne antim satr main teen wicket hasil kiye jisase bharat ne pehle din saat wicket par 273 ran banaae
 Gambhir said after the first day's play ended, "we have Zaheer and Ishant who can reverse swing the ball very well
" agar ve lay main hon to england ke liye bhi kaaphi pareshaani hogi
 "he said," Zaheer Khan specializes in reverse swing
 agar vah lay main aa jaae to mujhe lagata he ki england ke liye chintaa kii baat he

 Gambhir said, "he did not bowl a weak ball
 gend reverse kar rahi thi or usne chamakili taraf se gend ko chipa rakhaa tha
 If a bowler hides the brightness of the ball then it becomes very difficult for you because you cannot see how the brightness of the ball and which side it will move

 '' bharat ke is salaami ballebaaj ne kaha ki match abhi barabari par he or agar kal bharat 330 se adhik kaa score khadaa karne main safal rahata he to yah acha muqabla hoga
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki hamane do wicket adhik ganvaa die
 The way Ashwin was batting, we could carry it forward for some more time
 yah barabari kaa din rahaa
 i would not say that it favored England

 '' gambhir ne sweekaar kiya ki 23 ran ke nijee score par virendra sahvaag kaa ran out hona team ke najariye se niraashajanak tha
 Sehwag and Gambhir gave India a good start, reaching the team score of 47 runs in just 10 overs after which Sehwag was run out
 gambhir ne pehle din kaa khel samaapt hone ke baad kaha, ‘‘hamaare paas jahir or ishanth he jo gend ko kaaphi acchhee tarah reverse swing kar sakate hai
 If they are in rhythm then England will also face a lot of trouble
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘jahir khan ko reverse swing main maharath hasil hai
 If he gets into rhythm, i think it's a matter of concern for England
 ummid karata hum ki jahir or ishanth hamaare liye acha kaam karenge or bharat ke liye badi bhoomika nibhaayenge
 This is a wicket that has something for everyone
 ’’ Praising Anderson (three wickets for 68 runs), Gambhir said that the England fast bowler was hiding the ball very well and he dismissed Sachin Tendulkar and Ravichandran Ashwin through reverse swing
 gambhir ne kaha, ‘‘usne kamjor gend nahin phenki
 The ball was doing the reverse and he hid the ball from the bright side
 agar koi gendbaaj gend kii chamak kaa chhipaata he to aapke liye kaaphi mushkil ho jaataa he kyonki aap dekh nahin pate ki gend kii chamak kis tarah he or yah kis taraf move karegi
 Finally you have to play the ball late

 tippaniyan He said, "I think we lost two wickets more
 aswin jis tarah ballebaaji kar rahaa tha, ham kuch or der tak ise aage badha sakate the
 It was an equal day
 main yah nahin kahuunga ki yah england ke paksh main rahaa
 If we were able to score 330 to 350, it would be a good match
 ’’ Gambhir admitted that Virender Sehwag's run out on a personal score of 23 was disappointing from the team's point of view
 sahvaag or gambhir ne bharat ko acchhee shuruuaat dilaate hue sirf 10 over main team kaa score 47 ran tak pahunchaa diya tha jiske baad sahvaag ran out ho gaye

 khel mantralay ke lagaataar aagrah par karrwai karte hue rashtramandal khelon kii aayojan samiti ne apane vivaadaaspad sanyukt mahanideshak ties darbari kii sevaayen samaapt kar deen, jin par vittiya aniyamittaaon kaa aarope laga he
 The court was suspended until the investigation was completed after allegations of corruption surfaced during the launch of the Queens Beton Relay in London
 aayojan samiti ne ab darbari ko atirikt mahanideshak wike saxena ko prabhaar saunpane ko kaha he
 "due to matters in the Enforcement Directorate, the Ministry has written to the Organizing Committee several times to remove them and the last letter was written on August 6," a source said
 mantralay is baat se khush nahin tha ki use sirf nilambit kiya gaya
 The organizing committee finally followed the instructions and showed the court out
 sutara ne kaha, ‘‘aayojan samiti ke aadesh ke mutabik sanyukt mahanideshak (piesu, praayojan or marketing) darbari ke khilaaf landan main quins beton riley ke samay british company ko uski sevaaon ke liye aniyamit raashi bhugtan karne ke liye pravartan nideshaalay ke samaksh jaanch lambit hone ke kaaran unki sevaaon ko turant prabhaav se samaapt kar diya gaya he
 "he will hand over all the documents, papers and paraphernalia to VK Saxena, Additional Director General (PSU, Sponsorship and Marketing)," Sutra said
 ’’ aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh suresh kalmari ke mutabik landan main queens beton riley kii taiyaariyon kii jimmedaar darbari par thi

 saansadon ko rail yatra main koi pareshaani naa ho, iske liye railway ne deshbhar main maujuud 59 railway divijan ko nirdesh diya he ki ek-ek nodel officer banaaen jaaen
 It will be the responsibility of the Nodal Officer to keep information about the stations in the area where mps visit
 stesan master yaa stesan suparitendent ko saansad or saansad ke parivaar ke logon kii puri jaankaree bhi rakhni he or unki rail yatra kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana he
 Confirm tickets have to be arranged for them
 railway board se bheje gaye nirdesh ke mutabik, stesan par saansad kopura aaraam milior unhen koi takalif naa ho iskaa khyaal rakhana he
 The general passenger's decision to appoint a Nodal Officer for the protesters who are doing the Yatra is considered unfair by the common travelers
 yatri jai prakaash verma kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi se hawaii yatra ke baraabar kiraaya vasuulne ke baad bhi railway suvidhaayen muhaiyaa nahin kara paa rahaa, lekin saansadon ko atirikt suvidha de rahe
 This is completely wrong
 unhone kaha ki saansadon ko muft main yatra karne ke liye paas milte hai

 After the allegations, show cause notices were issued to Dushyant Chautala and Digvijay Singh and the reply was summoned
 in donon kaa maamla anushaasan samiti ko saunp diya gaya tha
 The committee found the allegations against these two to be true
 ise dekhte hue donon netaaon ko party kii praathmik sadsyta se baahar kar diya gaya he
 In fact, on 7 October 2018, a rally was organized in Gohana during the birthday celebration of Devi Lal
 raily main dushyant chautaala or digvijay singh chautaala par aarope lage ki unhone apane chachaa abhaya chautaala ke khilaaf narebaaji karwaai
 This was taken seriously by the party high command
 donon netaaon par anushaasanheenata or party netritv ke khilaaf narebaaji karwaane ke aarope bhi lagaae gaye the
 Om Prakash Chautalane informed the party office that he himself was present during the rally and noticed indiscipline
 chautaala ne kaha ki 'devilal kii tarah ve bhi yah maanate hai ki party kisi vyakti vishesh yaa parivaar se badi hoti he, isliye is maamle main anushaasan karrwai samiti kii jo sifarish he use turant prabhaav se lagu kiya jaae
 Please tell that Chaudhary Devi Lal's son Omprakash Chautala has two sons

 haal hi main film 'i dil he mushkil' se unka nayaa dance number 'brallep song' relies hua he
 In this song, the steps of Maranbir Birk are very much liked
 soshal media par to phans yah compliment dene se bhi nahin hichkichaae ki is song main ranbir anoushka par baari pad rahe hai
 But this is not the first time Ranbir has consumed more footage than his co-actress in a dance number
 atitude kahen yaa technic-ranbir pehle bhi kai dancegaanon main apni ko-actress se baaji maarthe dikhe hai
 There are some popular songs in this list
 
 
 'da brallep song'1
 Badtimiz Dil: This popular song of the film 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' is still the life of all parties
 ek kunvaare or beficre chhokare ke kirdaar main ranbir ne jaise jaan daal di thi
 With his dance in this song, he set a standard which is hardly possible to touch
 2
 Ghaghra: Another tremendous item song from the film 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' was 'ghaghra' in which Bollywood dance queen Madhuri Dixit had paired with Ranbir
 lekin gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki puure gane main ranbir kahin bhi maadhuri se unniis nahin lage
 In his dance, he not only retained his energy but also gave excellent expressions
 3
 Delhi Girlfriend: 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' is the third popular song 'delhi Wali Girlfriend' which is still heard often in weddings and parties
 is song main bhi ranbir apni ko-actress deepika padukon par baari pade the
 Throughout the song, the audience liked Ranbir's dance more than Deepika and also lavished applause and whistles
 4
 Matargashti: The most talked-about song in the film Tamasha, released last year, 'matargashti' made headlines for just two reasons - one is the ludicrous lyrics of songs and the other is ranbir-deepika's casual dance
 is gane main ranbir ne bahut hi phani dance steps dikhaae or audiyans kaa dil jeeta
 5
 taaen taaen phis:film 'chillar party' kaa yah item song bachche-bachche ki jubaan par kaaphi lambey samay tak chaaya rahaa
 The reason was Ranbir's tapori dance
 unic expreshans or energetic dance steps kii asli misaal ranbir ne is gane main dikhaai thi
 6
 besaram:film 'besaram' kaa yah tital song bhi ranbir ke dance kii vajah se kaaphi pasand kiya gaya
 The film may not have gone on, but the dance steps of this song were copied fiercely by the audience and also enjoyed
 7
 Jogi Mahi: With this song from the film 'bachna Ae Haseeno', Ranbir showed that he can adopt desi style in his dance along with foreign steps
 desi outfit or desi dance steps kaa parfect combination rahaa yah song
 8
 film 'barfi' kaa bollroom dance:ek gunge-bahere insaan kaa kirdaar nibhaate hue bhi ranbir ne jis tarah film 'barfi' main bollroom dance kiya tha usase audiyans ko charlie chaplin ki yaad aa gayi thi
 With successful experiments like these, Ranbir has always proved that the style of dance, outfit or song type - he fits every style

 inamen seva samooh, vaicharik samooh, aarthik samooh, shiksha samooh, saamaajik samooh, suraksha samooh aadi shaamil hai
 Concerned about the formation of the government, the RSS sources say that the Union leadership is satisfied with the policies of the government, but it is definitely worried about the public perception about its functioning

 There is no doubt about the remote control of this government with Prime Minister Modi, but it is an exaggeration to say that the Union reviews the policies and plans of the government
 modi sarkaar kii yojanaon or nitiyon ko jo bhi badlaav hote hai wo sangh se jude hue sanghathanon kii ground report ke aadhaar par hote hai
 This may indicate that the Sangh holds importance for the Modi government and the BJP
