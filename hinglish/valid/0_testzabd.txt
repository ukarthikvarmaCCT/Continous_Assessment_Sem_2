 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection

 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background

 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama

 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress

 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he

 The League sent a commission representing the various powers of the region, and in November 1921, the League decided that the borders of Albania, with three small changes that favored Yugoslavia, would remain the same as they were
 Was in 1913
 yadhyapi virodh ke tahat, yugoslavian fujen kuch saptaah baad hi peeche hat gayi
 The borders of Albania once again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General Enrico Telini and four of his assistants were killed in an ambush on 24 August 1923, when they were going to demarcate the newly demarcated border between Greece and Albania

 Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government should give Italy five crore lira as compensation
 The Greeks said that they would not pay the amount of compensation until it was proved that the crime was committed by the Greeks
 musolini ne unani dweep corfu ko jeetne ke liye ek yudhpot bheja or italvi sena ne 31 agast 1923 ko corfu par kabja kar liya

 french or polish sarkarein memel ko ek antarrashtriya shahar ke rup main parivartit karnaa chaahati thi jabaki lithuania us kshetra par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 By 1923, no decision was made regarding control of the region, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and take over the port

 The Klaipडियाda Convention was approved by the Council of the Union on 14 March 1924 and then by the Allied Powers and Lithuania
 sangh ne 1926 main mosul ke purv praant automan ke niyantran ko lekar iraq samrajya or turki ganraajya ke bich chal rahe vivaad ko hal kiya tha
 According to the British, who were given the League of Nations A-mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; On the other hand, the new Turkish Republic claimed the province to be its own historical central part
 belgium, hungary or sweden ke sadasyon ke saath ek raashtra sangh jaanch ayog ko 1924 main is kshetra ke adhyayan ke liye bheja gaya tha jisane paaya ki mosul ke log turki kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahate the or yadi unase chunane ko kaha jaataa to ve iraq ko chunate

 Agreed to support the League's plan for the region, remove the Polish troops, and cooperate with the referendum
 The League, however, now faced opposition from Lithuania and the Soviet Union, which had opposed any international force in Lithuania
 The League canceled the referendum and plans made for international force in March 1921 and came back to resolve the issue through negotiations between the two parties

 Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria

 Following allegations of forced labor in the us-owned Firestone Rubber Plantation and US allegations of slave trade, the Liberian government asked the United Nations to launch an investigation
 The commission constituted for the investigation was jointly appointed by the Union, the United States and Liberia
 1930 main, sangh kii ek report main pushti kii gai ki das pratha tathaa jabaran mazdooree prachlit thi
 The report found many government officials involved in the sale of bonded laborers and recommended that they be replaced by European or American ones
 The Liberian government outlawed slavery and forced labor and sought US assistance, a move that provoked anger inside Liberia resulting in President Charles DB King and his vice-president resigning
 The League then threatened that a trusteeship would be established on Liberia until the reforms were implemented
 President Edwin Barkley's focus shifted to implementing these reforms

 Subject to the terms of an agreed lease, the Japanese government was empowered to deploy its forces to the surrounding areas of the Southern Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between the two countries through the Chinese territory of Manchuria
 Was
 san 1931 ke sitambar main manchuriya ke ek akraman ke bahaane japani kwangtung sena ke adhikariyon or sainikon ke ek dal ne railway ke kuch bhaag ko thoda kshatigrast kar diya
 However, Japanese soldiers claimed that the railway had been demolished by Chinese troops and in apparent retaliation occupied the entire territory of Manchuria
 unhone is kshetra kaa namakaran manchuko kiya or 9 march 1932, ko ek kathputli sarkaar china ke purv maharaja pu yi ke netritv main sthapit kii
 Internationally, this new country was recognized only by the governments of Italy and Germany, while the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China
 san 1932 main, japan kii vaayu or jal sena ne china ke shanghai shahar par bamavarsha kii, jisane 28 janvari kii ghatana ko chingaari pradaan kiya
 The League of Nations agreed to request the Chinese government, but the long sea voyage caused the members of the union to delay investigating the case

 Despite Japan's high reach in the Union, the report presented by Litton proved Japan aggressive and demanded that Manchuria be returned to China
 Before the report was voted on by the Legislative Assembly, Japan announced its intention to move forward in China
 san 1933 main report vidhansabha main 42-1 ke bahumat se paarit hui, parantu china se apni sena hataane ke bajaay, japan ne sangh se apni sadsyta waapas le lee
 According to the manifesto, the United Nations should have responded by imposing economic sanctions on Japan, or should have gathered the military and declared war against it
 haalanki inamen se koi bhi kaarywahi kii nahin gai
 The threat of an economic embargo became almost useless because the United States was not a UN member
 kisi bhi prakaar kaa aarthik pratibandh sangh apane sadsy rajyon par aropit karata tha vah aprabhavi ho jaataa tha, kyonki jab ek sadsy raashtra ko dusre sadsy raashtra ke saath vyapaar karne ke liye pratibandhit kiya jaataa tha to vah sanyukt rajya america ke saath vyapaarik sambandh sthapit kar letaa tha
 The League of Nations could gather an army, but major powers such as Britain and France were also complicit in their own affairs, such as control of their vast empire, especially after the upheavals of the First World War
 Manchuria was therefore left under Japanese control until the Soviet Union's Red Army captured the area and returned it to China after World War II

 In December of 1935, the hoare-lavelle Treaty was an attempt by British Foreign Minister Samuel Hoare and French Prime Minister Pierre Lavelle to end the conflict in Abyssinia, which proposed to divide the country into two parts - an Italian territory and An Abyssinia region
 Mussolini agreed to the treaty, but news of the deal was leaked, as a result the French and British public strongly opposed it and called the treaty an offer to sell Abyssinia
 Hoare and Lavelle were forced to resign from their posts and both the British and French governments separated from their respective peoples

 The situation was the same with Japan, the major powers' enthusiasm in dealing with the crisis of Abyssinia was not due to their belief that the fate of this poor and remote country which was inhabited by non-europeans could not be the subject of their central interest
 Huh

 On 17 July 1936, the Spanish Army began a state-uprising, leading to a long-term armed conflict between the Spanish Republicans and the nationalists

 The Allies were also bound by the Treaty of Versailles to try to disarm and the arms embargo that was imposed on the defeated nations was described as the first attempt towards worldwide disarmament
 sangh prasanvida ne sangh ko prayek rajya ke liye ek nirsreekaran yojana taiyaar karne ke liye nirdisht kiya parantu parishad ne is jimmedaari ko 1926 main gathit vishesh ayog ko 1932-34 ke vishwa nirastrikaran sammelan kii taiyaari karne ke liye saunp diya
 The members of the Sangh had different views on disarmament
 francisi apane shastron ko is guarantee ke bina kam karne ke liye anicchhuk the ki unpar akraman hone par sainik sahaayta mili
 Poland and Czechoslovakia felt insecure on the west side and wanted the members to be strengthened before aggressive action by the union and disarming them
 Without this guarantee, they would not reduce their weapons because they felt that the threat of invasion from Germany was too high

 The last important function of the Union was the suspension of the Soviet Union in December 1939 when it invaded Finland

 Additionally, the US refusal to join the union limited the power of the organization

 It also tied the Union to the Treaty of Versailles, so that when the treaty became indistinct and unpopular, it also reflected in the League of Nations
 sangh kii tathakthith tatasthta ne ise anirnay ke rup main abhivyakt kiya
 It required a unanimous vote of its nine members, later fifteen council members, to pass an act; Therefore, decisive and effective work was difficult, if not impossible
 yah apane nirnyon par aane main dhimaa bhi tha kyonki kuch nirnyon main sampurna sabha kii sarvasammat manjuuri aavashyak thi
 This problem stemmed mainly from the fact that the main members of the League of Nations were not prepared to accept the possibility that their destiny would be decided by other countries and therefore, consequently, gave themselves the power to veto by implementing a unanimous vote
 sangh main pratinidhitiv aksar ek samasya thi
 Although it intended to include all nations, many never joined, or their partnership with the Union was too small

 Ruth Henning suggested that if the US had been a member of the Union, it would have supported France and Britain as well, presumably France would have felt more secure and such encouragement would have allowed France and Britain to cooperate more with Germany and this would lead to Nazi The rise of the party would have been less possible

 Foreign Office Minister Sir Eyre Crowe also wrote a memorandum to the British Cabinet claiming that "a serious union and contract" would be just "a treaty like other treaties": "what is there to ensure that it Won't break like other treaties? "
 Crowe expressed skepticism about the "pledge of common action" against the invaders because he believed that the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power
 He criticized the union's proposal for economic sanctions because it would be ineffective and was "a question of genuine military prominence"
 Crowe warned that universal disarmament was a practical impossibility

 There are many methods of propaganda
 dushprachaar kaa uddeshy soochna dene ke bajaay logon ke vyavhaar or raay ko prabhavit karnaa hota he
 Propaganda literally means propaganda, propaganda or propaganda in Hindi
 propaganda kisi vishesh uddeshy se, vishesh taur se raajnneetik uddeshy ke tahat, kisi vichaar or najariye ko failaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But its foundation usually does not depend on truth
 propaganda kii shuruyaat yuddh ke dauraan dushman kii sena ko naitik rup se parajeet karne ke liye ek afawaah ke rup main hui thi
 Then it is mentioned that in 1622, the fifteenth Pope Gregory took over the propaganda work against the Protestant Reforms in the Vatican
 propaganda kii chhavi nakaaratmak us samay bani jab pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan british sarkaar ne apane raajnneetik hiton ke patr main vyavasthit rup se propaganda kiya
 Later, it was also used for campaigning
 prarambh main ise raajnneetik partiyon ke chunaav-prachaar ke dauraan pratyaashee ke hit main samarthan khinchne ke liye istemaal hota tha
 Subsequently, considering its usefulness, it expanded and became a part of advertising
 vigyaapan ke saath judane par propaganda main sakaaratmak paksh bhi aayaa
 He began to play the role of the bearer of a pleasant feeling that touched emotions and became creative in a particular context
 propaganda dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi soochna kaa aadhaar aitihaasik rup se sakaaratmak na hokar hameshaa se hi nakaaratmak rahaa he
 The information given through it is often one-sided and misleading in nature
 propaganda kaa upyog raajnneetik kaarnon se kisi drushtikon-vishesh ko badhaava dene ke liye shuru kiya gaya tha
 Today the pane of propaganda has become very widespread and it is deliberately being used to spread negative information about a person, institution, nation, product or any political party
 propaganda kaa doosraa paksh yah he ki ise ek vishesh prakaar ke sandesh ke rup main bhi dekha jaataa he
 In the form of a message that is propagated through a slogan etc
 to propagate a particular culture, philosophy, idea or opinion in the market and society
 yuddh ke dauraan jhooth ko sach sabit karne ke liye propaganda kaa upyog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 America is considered the largest user of this propaganda
 vah yuddh ke dauraan hameshaa aisi khabar failaata he ki vah maanavtaa kii raksha or aatankwaad se ladane ke liye yuddh kar rahaa he, jabaki uskaa makasad kuch or hota he
 The biggest example of this is seen in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan in the last two decades
 america hameshaa yah bataata rahaa ki aatankwaad se ladane ke liye aisa karnaa zaruri tha jabaki sachai yah thi ki vah apane sainikon ke saath-saath aise patrakaron kii fuj bhi lekar chal rahaa tha jo uske paksh ke the yaa jinhen kareed liya gaya tha
 These journalists kept broadcasting information which was not true in the name of showing their news live
 aisi patrakarita ko hi jadit patrakarita yaa imbadid jarnalizam kaha jaataa he
 In such journalism, reporting is done as per the wishes of one party and the truth is lost
 kai baar is is patrakarita kaa upyog raajnneetik partiyon dwaara apane paksh main janamat banane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Some communicators believe that propaganda originated after the development of mass media
 ve ise sanchaar ke hisse ke rup main dekh kar maanate hai ki janamat ko apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye kiya jane vaala sanchaar propaganda kaa ek prakaar he
 Here it is necessary to consider the relation of communication and propaganda
 ikkisvin sadi ke praarambhik daur main radio ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko ek vishesh oochaal diya
 Through the radio, your talk can be reached to a wider audience in a very short time
 radio ke vikaas ne swayan-prerit or pryojit soochna ko failaane kaa hi kaam nahin kiya, varan isane us vigyaapan kaa bhi sutarapaatr kiya jiske viksit rup aaj vibhinn roopon main hamaare saamne hai
 In such a short time before the development of radio, it was impossible to reach directly to a wider audience
 yah zarur he ki print madhyam dwaara bhi sidhe taur par soochna kaa sampreshan kiya ja saktaa tha, lekin samachar patron ke pathak kam hi the
 The condition of literacy was also associated with becoming a reader
 radio ne vigyaapan ke ek naveen sansar kaa anaavaran kiya jahaan padhane kii yogyata hona zaruri nahin tha
 This made the reach and influence of advertising unlimited
 vigyaapan ke saath-saath raajnneetik propaganda kaa bhi vistaar bahut teji se hua
 The arrival of TV to Propaganda after radio gave another new boom
 tivi ne radio ko apdasth to nahin kar paaya, lekin radio ke mukaable isaki vishwasaneeyata logon ko zyaada pramanik nazar aayi
 When big companies introduced their products exaggeratedly, people started seeing their image in that promotion
 isiilie vigyaapan guru alek padmasi ne ek baar kaha tha ki bharat ke log jab kisi vastu ke graahak banate hai to vah tark se kam or bhaavana se zyaada banate hai
 He cites the example of Liril soap and said, 'what do you think this girl who is wearing a bikini bathing in a waterfall and feels refreshed like the smell of lemon smell, is it really possible in the villages and cities of real India The Where a bucket of water would have been destined to be bathed in a manner, how could it feel like the smell of lemon? On this basis, Padmasi says that through propaganda, advertising creates an image in front of the consumer in which consumers start seeing their image
 haal hi ke varshon main internet or i-mail ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko vaishvik vistaar diya
 Web-mediums, for example, have the power to make a local issue a global issue
 bhugolinta kii sari simaaon kaa web-madhyamon ne ulanghan karke sampoorn duniya ko ek chote se gaanv main tabdeel kar diya he
 In a moment, people have taken advantage of the Internet system to go from local to global
 ek sthaneey gayak or local sangeet kaise kuch samay main hi internet ke madhyam se sabase lokapriy sangeet ban jaataa he iskaa sabase shashakt udhaaharan he kolaberi di naamak geet
 In the language of marketing, what we know as viral marketing is actually propaganda in the language of media
 ek taraf to propegande ko nakaaratmak baat sakaaratmak dhang se pesh karne vaala madhyam kii tarah dekha jaataa he or duusari taraf propaganda prachaar kaa ek aisa hunar bhi he jisamen kisi vishay-vastu ko kuch is tareeke se pesh kiya jaataa he ki uski taraf log aakarshith ho jaaen
 The related subject should be presented through a language, rhythm and music that the common consumer feels connected to and associates with the product
 iske liye media ke vibhinya madhyamon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Such as: television, radio, banner, internet, billboard, leaflet, etc
 bhaawanaaon ko sparsh dene kii is bhoomika main nakaaratmak paksh sirf itnaa hi he ki aisa propaganda manushya kii taarkikta kaa sanhaar karke uski jagah par bhaavnaatmak paksh ko zyaada prabhavi bana detaa he
 Tristian Tolliver, an American advertising writer, has said about Propaganda: i always think of myself that people don't like what you did and did for them
 balki aapako hameshaa isliye yaad kiya jaataa he ki aapane apni baton ke madhyam se unhen kya mahasoos karaayaa
 For example, in Propaganda, it does not matter much how well you put something, but the most important thing is that the feeling and inspiration that comes out of it leaves a mark on people
 propaganda ke sukhad ehsaas main lambe samay tak yaad rakhe jane kii kshamta hoti he
 In this context, the use of propaganda in advertising has started giving it a positive form rather than just being negative
 is pahalu ke mutabik propaganda rachanaatmak prakruti kii avadharana par aadhaarit ek sampoorn prakriya kaa naam he
 How it is to be used - depends entirely on the user

 Dil Ek Mandir is a 1963 Hindi language film
 nikolai gogol ukraine mul ke roosi sahityakar the jinhone kahani, laghu upanyaas evam naatak aadi vidhaon main yugin aavashyaktaaon ke anuroop prabhoot lekhan kiya he
 Gogol was one of the earliest users of progressive ideology in Russian literature and his literary preference was synonymous with people-oriented
 aarambhik lekhan main prem-prasang tatva ke aadhiky hone par bhi bahut jaldi gogol saamaajik jivan kaa vyapaktaa tathaa gaharaai se bahuaiami chithran kii ore kendrit hote gayi
 The stories compiled in Mirgorod are living proofs of this fact
 petersburg kii kahaniyaan main sankalit rachanaaon main bhi visangatiyon evam vidambnaaon kaa maarmik chithran hasya evam sookshm vyangy ke madhyam se adbhut he; or inaki badi visheshta saamaanya jan ke saath-saath sahityakaron kii ek puri peedi ko prabhavit karnaa bhi he
 The main function of Gogol through stories as well as plays is to mold the epoch requirements into literature in such a way that it is safe to play a transformative role in the condition of the common people, as well as the literatures of literature, and critics Has considered him successful
 nikolai gogol kaa janm ukraine ke ek jameendaar parivaar main 20 march, 1809 i0 ko hua tha
 His father was also a well educated person and also wrote poems and humor
 iske atirikt ve rangamanch par abhinay bhi kiya karte the
 Due to these qualities of his father, Gogol has a keen interest in literature as well as theater since childhood
 jimnagium main shiksha praapt karte hue gogol rangamanch par abhinay bhi kiya karte the
 At the time of Gogol's education, the rise and spread of progressive romantic ideas among the elites had started secretly
 jimnagium main pragatisheel shikshakon kaa bhi ek dal tha jiskaa netritv belausov karte the
 In 1820, they were prosecuted by the Tsar government and students were called in this regard
 is samay gogol ne belausov ke paksh main bayaan diya tha
 In addition to Belausov's lectures, the works of Pushkin, Relyev and other progressivists also played an important role in the creation of Gogol's progressive approach
 1828 i0 main jimnagium kii shiksha samaapt kar gogol petersburg chale gayi
 On his way to Petersburg, Gogol also took his romantic poetry Mass Kuekhel Gartan
 ve apni is rachana par pushkin kii sammati chaahate the, parantu yah sambhav nahin ho sakaa va is kriti ke chhapane par isaki kadi aalochana hui or parinaam swaroop gogol ne uski sari pratiyaan jala daaleen
 Initially they were unsuccessful in Petersburg
 alexandra theatre main abhinayta banane kii unki abhilaashaa bhi puri nahin hui evam badi kathinaayee se unhen ek vibhaag main chote karmchaaree kii naukari mili
 While working there, he used to go to Kala Akademi in the evening and learn painting
 1830 i0 main gogol kii pehali kahani evan kupal se pehle kii shaam bina lekhkeey naam ke hi chhapi
 After some time, he quit his job and started concentrating fully in literary activities
 20 may 1831 ko gogol kaa parichay pushkin se ho paaya
 In 1831 AD, the first part of the rural evening was published near Gogol's story collection Dikanka and in 1832 AD, the second part came out
 is rachana kaa pathakon ke saath-saath aalochakon ne bhi hardik swaagat kiya
 The collection also compiled stories like May Night, Bhavya Badla, which became quite famous
 is sangrah main sankalit kahaniyon main gogol ne hasyapurna sookshm vyangy ke madhyam se ukraine kii yuva peedi ke vibhinn pakshon ko roopaankit kiya he
 Gogol's main aim is to convey the message of removing the weaknesses and inconsistencies of the younger generation through satire
 in kahaniyon main yatharth evam kalpana kaa manikanchan yoga he, tathaa isaki sabase badi visheshta janonmukhataa he
 In these compositions, the soul of the people, its mental aspect, its character and the poeticity of its life are all safe
 1835 i0 main gogol kaa nayaa kahani sangrah mirgorod prakashit hua
 It also compiled famous tall stories such as the fight of the next time landlord, Taras Bulba, Ivan Ivanovich with Ivan Nikifrovich
 in kahaniyon main jivan kaa chithran adhik vyapak tathaa gaharaa he or inamen prembhav lokkthatmakataa kam he
 In these works, Gogol has strongly depicted the human and mutual loving character of the landlords and the irony and hollowness of the inner life - both sides
 taras bulba naamak lambii kahani main jameendaaron ke sankeern jivan ke pratipaksh main janajivan kaa chithran karte hue swatantra kazzaakon ke sahaspurn ateet kaa drishy saamne rakhaa gaya he
 At the center of the narrative is Taras Bulba, who fights for his country, who does not hesitate to give the death penalty even to his traitorous son
 yah katha janajivan kaa lokprabandh he
 For these works, Russian critic Belinsky gave Gogol the title of the leader of literature, the leader of poets
 1835 i0 main gogol kaa naveen kahani sangrah araveski prakashit hua, jisamen nevsky praspekt, tasviir, pagal kii tippaniyan jaisi kahaniyaan sankalit thim
 All these stories were later named as the stories of Petersburg, combining stories such as nose and overcoat written later
 in kahaniyon main gogol kii lokadrushti kaaphi vyapak rahi he
 The life of the capital, the life of a dream artist, the life of a poor employee, etc
 Gogol portrayed a multi-faceted and poignant portrayal of life
 in rachanaaon main hasya evam sookshm vyangy ke madhyam se jivan kii visangatiyon evam vidambnaaon kaa maarmik chithran adbhut he
 Signs of self-generated solutions through lethal injury in laughter environments make Gogol's art distinctive
 inhen kaarnon se belinsky ne gogol ke vyangy ko 'aansuon ke bich hansee' kaha he
 a single example would suffice to know how popular Gogol's overcoat had become and how it had influenced later writers, that many of the narrators in Turgeneb's era in Russia used to say that we came out of Gogol's overcoat
 san 1835-36 main gogol or pushkin ke bich ghanishthata badi
 Gogol began to support the contemporary published by Pushkin
 apni suprasiddh rachanaaon 'da government inspector' tathaa 'da ded sols' kii vishaywastu gogol ko pushkin se hi praapt hui thi
 Regarding the 'inspector', Gogol himself has admitted that in it i have decided to collect all the evils of Russia, which i am aware of, in one place, and all the injustices that have taken place in those places and situations
 Go, where the most demanding justice is done to humans, and have decided to laugh at all of them together
 is kamedi ke abhinay se pragatisheel vichaardhaara ke log to bade prasann hue, parantu pratikriyaavaadi kaaphi naaraaz hue or ise karmchaariyon par anargal akshep bataakar is naatak ko jabt karne kii maang karne lage
 Gogol was greatly disturbed by these things and his health also deteriorated
 aise main kuch chaiyn paane evam 'mrit atmaaen' ke lekhan main dhyaan de paane ke liye gogol 1836 i0 main videsh-yatra par chalaa gaya
 After staying in Paris for some time, he settled in Rome and came to Russia only occasionally for publication
 san 1841 main mrit atmaaen kaa pratham bhaag purna hua
 It was published after much difficulty
 is rachana ne gogol ko amar kar diya
 In spite of the sarcasm of this satire, Gogol portrayed the life of Russia in its entirety, and made a very comprehensive and serious depiction of all the errors and evils of the era
 tatkaaleen yug ke roosi jivan kaa nagn chitra prastut karne ke kaaran geranson ne mrit atmaaen ko traas or shame kii cheekh kaha tathaa belinsky ne use us yug kaa sabase mahatvapurn saahitiyik kriti mana
 In addition to the earlier works, Golol has also shown his creative power in the form of Maniloy, Karowochka, 'najdrev', 'sawkevich', 'plushkin', Chichikov 'etc
 apni rachanaaon ke madhyam se gogol ne roosi sahitya main aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' kii neenv daali
 Gogol's works have been translated into many languages of the world, including Hindi

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were two and one forgiveness, second wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
