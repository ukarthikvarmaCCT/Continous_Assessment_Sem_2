 Meyer's debut novel, Twilight, has garnered many awards: gautam rishi ke putr kaa naam shardwan tha
 He was born with arrows
 unhen vedabhyaas main jaraa bhi ruchi nahin thi or dhanurvidya se unhen atyadhik lagaav tha
 He became so adept at archery that Devraj Indra started being afraid of him
 indra ne unhen sadhana se digane ke liye namapadi naamak ek devkanya ko unke paas bhej diya
 Due to the beauty of the beauty of that Devakanya, Shardwan was so much compressed that his semen was ejaculated and fell on a reed
 vah sarkanda do bhaagon main vibhakt ho gaya jisamen se ek bhaag se krip naamak balak utpann hua or duusare bhaag se kripi naamak kanya utpann hui
 Kripa also excelled in archery like his father
 bhishma ji ne inhen krip ko pandavon or kauravon kii shiksha-diksha ke liye niyukt kiya or ve kripacharya ke naam se vikhyath huye
 After the completion of the elementary education of Pandavas and Kauravas by Kripacharya, Bhishma Ji appointed Acharya named Drona for special education of weapons
 in dronacharya ji kii bhi ek vishesh katha he
 Once Bhardwaj was performing a sage sacrifice
 ek din ve ganga nadi main snaan kar rahe the
 There, he saw an apsara named Ghritarchi taking a bath in the Ganges
 us apsara ko dekh kar unke man main kaam vaasana jaagrit hui or unka veery skhlit ho gaya jise unhone ek yajna paatr main rakh diya
 Later, Drona originated from the same sacrificial fire
 dron apane pita ke ashram main hi rahete huye chaaron vedon tathaa astr-shastron ke gyaan main paarangat ho gayi
 Along with Drona, Drupada, the son of a king named Prashat, was also getting education and both of them became close friends
 unheen dinon parashuram apni samast sampatti ko brahmanon main daan kar ke mahendrachal parvat par tap kar rahe the
 Once Drona reached out to him and requested him to donate
 is par parashuram bole, “vatsa! tum vilamb se aaye ho, maine to apana sab kuch pehle se hi brahmanon ko daan main de daalaa he
 Now i have only the weapons left
 tum chaaho to unhen daan main le sakate ho
 "that's what Drona wanted, so he said," Hey Gurudev! i will be very happy to get your weapons and weapons, but you will have to teach me these weapons and you will also have to tell me the law
 ” is prakaar parashuram ke shishy ban kar dron astr-shastradi sahit samast vidyaon ke abhootpurv gyaata ho gayi
 After receiving education, Drona was married to Kripacharya's sister Krupi
 kripi se unka ek putr hua
 At the time of birth from the mouth of his son, the sound of horse came out, so he was named Ashwatthama
 kisi prakaar kaa rajashray praapt na hone ke kaaran dron apni patni kripi tathaa putr ashwatthama ke saath nirdhantaa ke saath rah rahe the
 One day his son Ashwatthama woke up to drink milk but due to his poverty Drona could not arrange cow's milk for his son
 aksmaat unhen apane balykaal ke mitra raja drupad kaa samaran ho aayaa jo ki paanchal desh ke naresh ban chuke the
 Drona went to Drupada and said, "friend! i have been your classmate
 mujhe doodh ke liye ek gaay kii aavashyaktaa he or tumse sahaayta praapt karne kii abhilaashaa le kar main tumhaare paas aayaa hoon
 On this, Drupada, forgetting his old friendship and coming under the ego of being the king himself, was spoiled on Drona and said, "you don't feel ashamed to call me your friend?" Friendship is only between people of the same class, poor like you and not a king like me
 ” Humiliated, Dron returned from there and started living secretly at Kripacharya's house
 ek din yudhisthir aadi rajkumaar jab gend khel rahe the to unki gend ek kuen main ja giri
 While passing through, Drona asked the princes for help to get the ball out of the well
 dron ne kaha, “yadi tum log mere tathaa mere parivaar ke liye bhojan kaa prabandh karo to main tumhaara gend nikaal doongaa
 Yudhishthira said, "dev! If our grandfather is allowed, you will be able to have food forever
 ” dronacharya ne tatkaal ek mutthi seenk lekar use mantra se abhimantrit kiya or ek seenk se gend ko chheda
 Then the second sync pierced the sink stuck in the ball
 is prakaar seenk se seenk ko chhedate huye gend ko kuen se nikaal diya
 In the subject of this wonderful experiment and known to be a scholarly scholar in all subjects of Drona, Bhishma Pitamah appointed him for the higher education of the princes and took him to the royal palace and became known as Dronacharya

 unka chupchaap chalaa janaa uchit nahin tha
 Here the proposal or episode is about Buddhadev's homicide
 yah prastaav na hone se yah vyangy nahin nikalataa
 Similarly, in Deshvishyatyopannavachayasambhava - where there is satire due to the characteristic of the place, this distinction is made
 jaise- Here, happiness and memories of Ramchandraji's time of exile are expressed which are manifest by country-specialty
 in pruthak-pruthak visheshtaon se varnan ke anusaar bhi vyangy suchit hota he

 Some scholars are of the opinion - He also wrote a Marathi commentary on the Abhinav circle, but Yogavasistha, but unfortunately it is inaccessible
 un dinon ke lagbhag saare dharmagranth sanskrit main hote the or aam janata bahut sanskrit nahin jaanati thi, astu tejasvi balak gyaneshwar ne keval 15 varsh kii umr main hi gita par marathi kii bolchaal bhashaa main 'gyaneshwari'naamak gita-bhashya kii rachana karke marathi janata kii unki apni bhashaa main upadesh kar jaise gyaan kii jholii hi khol di
 The commentator himself has written - "now if i have a proper discussion of the Gita in Marathi language, then what is the reason for this wonder 


 Is there nothing possible with guru-kripa?" is granth kii samaapti ke uparaant gyaneshwar ne apane raajnneetik siddhanton kii swatantra vivechna karanevaale 'amritanubhav' naamak duusare granth kaa nirmaan kiya
 After the completion of this book, these four brothers and sisters reached the nearby village of Alandi in Pune
 yahan se inhone yogiraj changdev ko 65 oviyon main jo patr likhaa vah maharashtra main 'changdev pasashthi' naam se vikhyath he
 When Gyanadev left Alandi for the purpose of pilgrimage, he was accompanied by his brothers, sisters, grandmother, and many contemporary saints like Visova Khecher, Gora Kumhar etc
 visheshtya namdev tathaa gyandev ke aapasi sambandh itane snehpurn the ki aisa lagata tha maano is tirthayatra ke bahaane gyaan or karm donon tapasviyon ke bhes main saakaar rup dhaaran kar ekarup ho gaye hon
 Returning from the pilgrimage, Gyan Dev reached Alandi by Pandharpur route
 vidwaanon kaa anumaan hai ki gyandev ne isi kaal main apane 'abhangon' kii rachana kii hogi
 After re-establishing the bhagavata-dharma by introducing the Bhakti Marg from the child to the elderly, Gyan Dev decided to take a living samadhi in Alandi village, despite being very young
 maatr 21 varsh teen maah or paanch din kii alpaayu main vah is nashwar sansar kaa parityag kar samadhisth ho gayi
 Saint Namdev has written the account of Gyandev's tomb
 apane guru nivrittinath ko antim vandan kar gyandev sthitprajna ke samaan samadhimandir main ja baithe
 Thereafter, the Guru himself closed the gateway to the Samadhimandir
 gyaneshwar, jinhen dhyaneshwar bhi kaha jaataa he, ne yah jivit samadhi gram aalindi samvath main shake 1217 kii margshirsh vadi triyodashi ko lee, jo pune ke lagbhag 14 kilometre dur ab ek prasiddh tirth ban gaya he
 Many works like 'dnyaneshwari', 'amritanubhav', 'changdev Pasathi' and 'abhang' written by Dnyaneshwar are well accepted
 kuch varsh purv yah siddhant upasthit kiya gaya tha ki gyaneshwari ke lekhak tathaa abhang ke rachayita, ek hi naam ke do bhinn vyakti hai
 But now it has been accepted by refuting this principle from many firm grounds that these creations are only of the person Saint Dnyaneshwar / Dhyaneshwar
 apane abhangon main gyaneshwar ne tatvacharchaa kii gaharaaiyon ko na napate hue adhikaar vaani se saadhaaran janata ko achardharm kii shiksha di he
 The result was that this disregard was completely reflected in the minds of children from old to old
 gurukrupa, namsmaran or satsang ye parmarthpath kii teen seedhiyaan hai, jinka digdarshan sant gyaneshwar ne apni shikshaaon main multah karaayaa he
 Jnanadev was a great saint likewise he was also a great poet
 unki aadhyatmik sadhana kavyras se aplavit he, unki kavita ko darshan kii guru-gambhirtha mili he
 It is true that due to the disguise of Dnyaneshwar being like 'you-past', there have been visions of rasa-sources in it, however, his knowledge has been completed in Dnyaneshwari itself
 kavy ke donon angon, ras or alankaar kaa gyaneshwari main sundar samanvay he
 Like Dyanvichar and Kavyasoundarya, all the works that Dnyaneshwar did in the traditional life of Maharashtra were revolutionary
 un dinon karmkand kaa bolbalaa tha, samaaj kaa netritv karanevaali panditon kii parampara prabhaavaheen ho chuki thi
 In such a state, while establishing the importance of spiritual knowledge, Gyandev gave the assessment of devotional path of the common man
 panditon ke granthon tak simit rahanevaala aadhyatm darshan shudradikon ke liye bhi sahaj sulabh ho, ise dhyaan main rakhte hue' gyaneshwari' kii rachana kii gai
 Due to being born in a clan considered 'low', no matter how 'low' a person is considered socially, but God gives equal shelter to everyone, the credit for rendering this theory is to Dnyaneshwar
 maharashtra main inke granth gyaneshwari ko 'mouli' yaa mata bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the second sermon and assurance, at that time only a generation of Bhagavadhaktas were created in all the castes of Maharashtra and Marathi sentimental male and female started singing the glory of Lord Pandurang or Vitthal of Pandharpur in their own language
 bhagavan keval kathor nyaayadhish hi nahin, apitu sahajvatsal pita bhi hai
 He has compassion for a mother in his eyes - Dnyaneshwar told this in his simple-sweet language all over Maharashtra
 isi kaaran yahan punah ek baar bhagwat dharm kii sthapana hui tathaa is sampradaay ke pramukh dharmagranth ke rup main 'gyaneshwari' kii bhi samaanyajan ke bich pratishtha hui
 Due to this, many Bhagwat poets composed books in Marathi language and created a rich poetry tradition on the path of devotion, which is why Jnanadev became the proto-promoter of Maharashtra culture

 sambandhit janaganana code: neo-hegelism, a type of philosophical approach prevalent among British and American thinkers in the 19th and 20th centuries AD, whose logical underpinnings are basically understood and used by the German philosopher Hegel in building his theories
 navhegelwaad kaa spasht janm england main 1865 main jemz hachinson sterlig dwaara hegel rahasy vishyak granth ke prakaashan se hua
 Sterling proclaimed Hegel to provide new light on all human issues

 Around the same time, a conceptual philosophy journal edited by William Tauri Harris and the Cornford Philosophy and Literature Board began promoting Hegel in St
 Louis in the United States
 inkaa hegel se dharm main paramparawaad or vigyaan main prakrutwad kaa virodh karne kii shakti praapt hui or raajnneeti ke kshetra main yah prerana praapt hui ki vyakti kii swatantraaa manamaane vyavhaar main nahin, sthapit rajyanium main abhivyaktipraapt jivan ke vikaas main he
 But the leading proponents of neo-hegelism have been Tomas Hill Green, Edward Caird, John Rollis Mactagart, Francis Herbert Bradley and Bernard Bosnett in England, and Joziah Royce and James Radwin Cretan in the United States
 navhegelwaad ko paramanirpeksh aadhyatmavaad bhi kaha jaataa he
 Its special belief is that the non-being is the ultimate element and the non-absolute is either the whole system or the world, mental or spiritual and also one, all the real substance and especially the ideal ie the subject of evaluation and the suffix, i
e
 the subject of perception
 uskaa vishwa ke prayek pradesh main nivas he
 In addition, this notion of the secular is full of experiential and empirical asymmetries
 neo-hegelists were strongly influenced by Hegel's fundamental grounded theory of dialectical reasoning that every logical fact has a third organ or phase called Hegel's phase of hypothesized or factual intelligence
 , In which there is a sense of emotion in the absence of unity of opposing elements, that is, all the immortal self The forms are bound by the solid tangible formula of unity, in which the opposition of the self-conscious and self-conscious knowledge is erased, in which existence becomes known as pure suffix and as pure suffix and pure suffix exists
 In which the true essence is the complete elemental of its entire development attaining its perfection
 navhegelvaadi darshanik puri tarah hegelvaadi kahalaane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Notably, none of them accepted the adoption of the hegemonic design of Hegel's dialectical arguments
 at: unhone hegelvaadi tarkshastra kii ek naveen, swatantra, spashttar evam adhik vishvasotpadak rup main vyakhya karne kaa praytn kiya
 There are three main principles of this new interpretation
 ek yah ki jo buddhi ko santusht kar de vahi satya he or usee kaa antim astitv he
 According to this theory, there is no difference in truth existence
 prayek tarkvakya kaa uddeshy vastavata hi he
 The second principle is that any logical decision has a near objective and a distant objective
 parantu yah donon ek hi sampurna ke ansh hote hai or nirnay is sampurna ke vishay main hi hua karata he
 This whole has been called by the neo-hegelists as 'tangible omnipresent'
 iske vicharanusaar yah vastavatantra he
 In this, suffixes have external and implicit and they are interwoven in functional relations
 tark is tantra ke andar hi vibhinn padon or sambandhon ke bich chalaa karata he
 The secularists have considered all relations to be internal and the fulfillment of this principle of internality of relations is understood in the notion of non-secularism itself
 navhegelwaad kaa tritiy mukhya siddhant yah he ki bodh tathaa moolyankan man kii ek hi bauddhik kriya ke do avichchhedya ang hai
 Therefore, the criterion of both truth and value ie meaning is the same and that is completeness, ie, indecency

 The term "web 2
0" is commonly used for web programs / applications that facilitate sharing of interactive functional information, sharing of information, designing with a user in mind, and connecting to the World Wide Web
 Web 2

 a Web 2

 2004 main o reli media Web 2

 Although the term refers to a new version of the World Wide Web, it does not refer to updating any technical features, but reflects changes in the way an end user / user and software developer uses the web

 The term "web 2

 darsi dinuchi apane lekh "khandit bhavishya" main likhti hai: The term by him is mainly used for web design and creative works

 In 2004, the term grew in popularity, when o'reilly Media and Media Live hosted the first Web 2
0 conference
 In their inaugural address, John Battle and Tim o'reilly highlighted their definition of "web as a platform" of how software programs / applications are being built on the web rather than on the desktop
 unhonen tark diya ki is pravaas / badlaav kaa ek anoothaa pahalu yah he ki "graahak aap ke liye aapke vyavsaay kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai"
 unhone daleel di ki upyogkarta dwaara nirmit saamagree kaa prayog upyogita badhaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 o'reilly and others compared Web 2
0 to the so-called "web 1
0"
 He linked Web 1
0 to the business model of Netscape and the online Encyclopaedia Britannica
 for example, netscape ne "web ek manch" ko puraane software ke rup main nirupit kiya he : unka pramukh utpaada web brouzar, ek desktop program tha or unki ranneeti brouzar ke bazaar main apane prabhutv kaa prayog karke oonchi keemton vaale sarwar utpaadon ke bazaar par kaabiz hone kii thi
 Controlling the performance standards of content and programs in a browser gave Netscape the market place Microsoft had redeemed in the PC market
 As Netscape promoted the use of webtops instead of desktops, as did the design of a horseless automobile, it was popularized by information providers purchasing Netscape servers, which would update information and use applets in webtops
 Planned to make
 sankshep main, netscape ne software banane, vibhinn avasaron par ise apadet karne tathaa ise antim upyogkarta tak pahunchaane par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 In contrast, o'reilly cites the example of Google, a company that does not focus on software production such as browsers, but instead focuses on providing data-based services
 yahan data kaa abhipraay beshak un link se he jo web pej lekhak citon main banaate hai
 Google through its "page rank algorithm" uses this user-generated content to facilitate search on the web
 software, jise ek nishchit samay par release / zaari kiya jaataa he, ke vipareet google jaisi seva ek prakriya ke madhyam se lagaataar apadet hoti rahati he jise "the perpetual beta" kehete hai
 One such difference can be seen between the online encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia: While Britannica relies on experts for its articles and releases them from time to time for publication, Wikipedia is constantly and quickly making anonymous content available to anonymous users
 Unwavering believes
 vikipedia visheshgyata par aadhaarit nahin he balki mukt stroton se software ko is ukti ko charitaarth karte hue grahan karata he - "zyaada logon dwaara dekhne par ek samasya aasaani se sulajh sakati he" or yah apane lekhon kaa nirantar nirmaan tathaa unhen apadet karata rahata he

 The report has made several appropriate recommendations for starting small experimental projects and measuring their results, whose list is quite long
 client said / web brouzar praudyogikiyaan jo Web 2
0 main prayukt hoti hai - Asynchronous javascript or XML, Adobe Flash or javascript / Ajax Fremwork jaise ki Yahoo! UI Library, Dojo Toolkit, mootools or jquery
 Ajax programing web sarwar se ek puraa prishth punah lod kiye bina, nayaa data aplod or downlod karne ke liye javascript kaa prayog karti he
 To allow the user to work on the page, communications from the server such as data requests are separated from the data returning to the page
 
 anyathaa, upyogkarta ko us pej par kuch bhi karne se pehle niyamit rup se data ke vaapis tak pratiksha kerani padegi, jis prakaar upyogkarta ek pej ko punah lod karne ke liye pratiksha karata he
 This also increases the overall performance of the site, as faster requests can be sent and data can be sent to the customer without interruptions or lines
 Ajax anurodh dwaara liya gaya data aamtaur par XML yaa JSON, do vyapak rup se prayukt hone vaale sanrachit data swaroop hai, ke rup main formet hota he
 Since javascript can be easily understood by both of these formats, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data to their web program
 jab yah data Ajax dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he, to javascript program document object model kaa prayog karke naye data ke aadhaar par web pej ko swachaalit dhang se apadet kar detaa he, jisase ek teevr tathaa parsparik kriyaatmak prayokta kaa anubhav miltaa he
 In short, using these techniques, web designers can create their own pages to function as desktop programs 
 udhaaharan ke liye, Google Docs is takanic kaa upyog web aadhaarit verde procesar banane ke liye karata he
 Adobe Flash is another technique often used in Web 2

 vyapak rup se uplabdh plagain jo W3C maanakon ke adheen nahin hai, flash se aisa bahut kuch kiya ja saktaa he jo vartmaan main HTML main sambhav nahin he, ek bhashaa jiskaa prayog web pej banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Among the many capabilities of Flash, the most commonly used in Web 2
0 is its ability to play audio and video files
 isse Web 2
0 citen jaise ki youtube kaa nirmaan ho sakaa he jisamen video media ko saamaanya HTML ke saath jod diya gaya he
 In addition to Flash and Ajax, javascript / Ajax Fremworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2

 Many of these come with modifiable, and prefabricated 'widgets' that accomplish common tasks, such as taking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or creating a tabbed panel
 sarwar said par Web 2
0, web 1
0 kii kai samaan takneekon kaa prayog karata he
 Languages such as PHP, Ruby, coldfusion, Perl, Python and ASP are used by developers to automatically output information from files and databases
 Web 2
0 dwaara data ko formet karne ke dhang main badlaav shuru hua he
 In the early days of the Internet, there was little need for different websites to interact and share data

 For example, Paul Miller argues in the Talis White Paper "library 2

 blog, wikis or RSS aksar Web 2

 The reader of a blog or wiki is provided with the tools by which he can post his comments in the blog or edit the content in case of wiki
 ise ham padhane / likhane yogya web kehete hai
 Tallis believes that Library 2
0 means the use of such partnerships, allowing libraries to benefit from rapidly growing catalog efforts, such as collaborating with fellow libraries and records from publishers and others in the form of books or movie files
 By adding and expanding

 Proponents of "web 2
0" may undoubtedly see the collection of site content as a feature of Web 2
0, as it standardizes protocols that allow end users to use the site's data in another way
 
 ve protocol jo sindication kii anumati dete hai unamem, RSS, RDF or Atom, sabhi xml-aadhaarit formet, shaamil hai
 Observers have begun referring to these technologies as "web feeds used as Web 2

0 citon kii ek aam suvidha he, web API, ke prayog ke liye do tareekon kaa prayog karte hai, jo data or kaaryon ke liye web aadhaarit anumati dete hai:rest or SOAP
 Often servers use built-in apis, but standard apis are also widely used

 Critics of the term claim that "web 2
0" does not exactly represent a new version of the World Wide Web, but only advances the use of techniques and concepts of the so-called "web 1

 Secondly, many plans for Web 2

 But perhaps the most common criticism is that the word is ambiguous or merely a slogan

 In terms of the social impact of Web 2
0, critics like Andrew Keane argue that Web 2
0 has created a group of digital narcissists and hobbyists, including inappropriate opinions - any of their opinions and content about any of their topics
 The type looks at the concept of expertise by allowing anyone, anywhere, to share it, regardless of their particular talent, knowledge, identity, bias, or potential hidden plan

 fluid mechanics bal, dravyaman evam twaran Heat, energy and heat kwantem yantriki The laws of conservation are of paramount importance in science
 ye mul niyam spes, samay evam kala kii samaangta ke parinaam hai
 See Amy Nether's theorem
 Other less significant laws are the mathematical consequences of the above conservation laws for derivative physical quantities : Chemical laws are those laws of nature relevant to chemistry
 The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary chemical reaction
 Modern physics shows that it is actually energy that is conserved, and that energy and mass are related; a concept which becomes important in nuclear chemistry
 Conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics
 Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass
 Joseph Proust's law of definite composition says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important
 Dalton's law of multiple proportions says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers; Although in many systems the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction
 More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and transformations
 Thermodynamics kwantem yantriki It is thought that the successful integration of Einstein's field equations with the uncertainty principle and Schrödinger equation, something no one has achieved so far with a testable theory, will lead to a theory of quantum gravity, the most basic physical law sought after today

 Geographical segmentation The manufacturer can segment the market in a geographical way such as nation, state, climate, country, city etc
 bhugolic vibhaajan janasankhyikeey or bhugolic donon kii suchana rakhata jisase company kii rurekha acchhee kar saken
 As we can take the example of the weather, the manufacturer can sell umbrella and rain-safe items during the rainy season

 Cultural division divides cultural division by customer culture, culture is a strong reason customer behavior can be detected, when the producer gets to know about the customers thinking then he can release his production accordingly
 The culture divides the producer to convey his message to them properly

 This process is called Targeting or the customers of the divided group are one or one The method of recording by attracting and evaluating segments of more areas is called target setting
 khand keakarshan The attractiveness of the segment is also affected by the size of the segment
 The larger the size of the segment, the more time it takes to reach the target customers
 If the segment is small then the customers of that segment take less time to target and reach

 This segment is economical because the producer does not have to focus on different segments and it does not have to focus on that segment
 Is able to target all customers properly
