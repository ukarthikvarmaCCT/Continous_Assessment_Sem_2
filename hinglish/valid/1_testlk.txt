 Earlier, the central government had complete control over the provincial governments

 Mitra or Alpha Santouri, whose Bayer name is α Centauri or α Cen, is the brightest star in the Narturang planetarium
 yah prithvi se dikhne vaale taron main se chauthaa sab se roshan tara bhi he
 a visible star from Earth is actually a three star multi-star circle
 inamen se do to ek dwitara mandal main hai or inhen mitra "e" or mitra "bi" kaha jaataa he
 The third star is at some distance from them and has got the name of friend "C" or "proxima Santouri"
 suraj ko chhodkar, proxima santori hamaari prithvi kaa sab se nazadiiki tara he or hamase 4
24 prakaash-varsh kii duuri par he
 Yet Proxima Santouri is so small that it cannot be seen without binoculars
 oktober 2012 main vaigyanikon ne ghoshnaa kari ki mitra tara mandal ke ek taare ke ird-gird ek gair-saureey grah parikrama karata hua paaya gaya he
 The planet was named 'mitra BB' and is the closest known non-planetary planet from Earth but it is very close to its star and does not fall in the habitable zone
 angrezi main mitra ko "alfaa santori" or mitra "si" ko "proxima santori" bolte hai
 Mitra has many other traditional names such as Rizile Cantaurus and Toliman
 sochaa jaataa he ke tolimaan kaa naam arabi bhashaa ke "al-zulmaan" shabd se aayaa he, jiskaa arth he "shuturamurg"
 Friend "B" is found circling a non-planetary planet around the star
 iskaa namakaran 'mitra bi-bi' kara gaya
 The size of this planet is almost equal to that of Earth but it is only 60 lakh km away from its sun
 is kaaran se isapar taapmaana bahut unchaa hone kii sambhaavna he - anumaan lagate hai ki yah 1,200 degree centigrade se bhi unchaa hoga, yani isapar pathar lava kii tarah pighale hue honge
 Due to this proximity, it also completes one orbit of its star in just 3
2 days
 phir bhi aisa dekha gaya he ki jab itane kam aakaar kaa grah ho to aise mandal main aksar anya grah bhi hote hai
 Scientists say that it is possible that there are other planets in this star which are in habitable zone
 mithila pracheen bharat main ek rajya tha
 It is believed that it is the present-day Terai region of North Bihar and Nepal which was known as Mithila
 mithila kii lokshruti kai sadiyon se chali aa rahi he jo apni bauddhik parampara ke liye bharat or bharat ke baahar jaani jaati rahi he
 Maithili is the main language of this region
 hindu dharmik granthon main sabase pehle iskaa sanket shatapath brahman main tathaa spasht ullekh valmikiy ramayana main miltaa he
 Mithila is mentioned in Mahabharata, Ramayana, Purana and Jain and Buddhist texts
 puranic ullekhon ke anusaar is kshetra kaa sarvaadhik pracheen naam mithila hi praapt hota he; saath hi videh naam se bhi ise sambodhit kiya gaya he
 The name arrowhead proves to be much later according to the mentions received
 videh or mithila namakaran kaa sarvaadhik pracheen sambandh shatapath brahman main ullikhit videgh maathav se judata he
 The early times of Mithila settling are indicated in the above story
 videgh maathav tathaa uske purohit gotam rahuugan saraswati nadi ke tir se purv kii ore chale the
 In front of them, fire was running after the water of the global rivers
 sadanira nadi ko agni sukha nahin sake or videgh maathav dwaara yah puche jane par ki ab meraa nivas kahan ho, agni ne uttar diya ki is nadi ke purv kii ore tumhaara nivas ho
 It is clearly mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmin that earlier Brahmins did not cross this river and the land here was not fertile
 usamen daldal bahut tha kyonki agni vaishwanar ne uskaa aswadan nahin kiya tha
 But now it is very fertile because the Brahmins have sacrificed it and offered it to the fire
 gandki nadi ke bare main yah bhi ullekh he ki garmi ke baad ke dinon main bhi, arthath kaaphi garmi ke dinon main bhi, yah nadi khub bahati he
 Videha seems to be related to the word Videgh and Mithila with the word Mathav
 shatapath main hi gandaki nadi ke bare main ullekh karte hue spasht rup se videh shabd kaa bhi ullekh hua he
 There it has been said that till now this river is the boundary between Kosala and Vidah countries; And this land has been called the child of Mathav
 valmikiy ramayana tathaa vibhinn puraanon main mithila naam kaa sambandh raja nimi ke putr mithi se joda gaya he
 There is a legend everywhere in these texts with minimal differences that Mithi was born from the churning of Nimi's dead body
 valmikiy ramayana main mithi ke vanshaj ke maithil kahalaane kaa ullekh hua he jabaki puranic granthon main mithi ke dwaara hi mithila ke basaaye jane kii baat spasht rup se kahi gayi he
 In many texts, it is said in many texts that his name was born because of his birth, he was called Vaideh because of his birth from Videha father and his name became Mithi due to his birth from churning
 is prakaar unheen ke naam se unke dwaara shasit pradesh kaa naam videh tathaa mithila mana gaya he
 In the Mahabharata, the name of the state has been called 'mithila' and its rulers have been called 'videha dynasty'
 vrihadvishnupurana ke mithila-mahatmaya main mithila evam tirbhukti donon naam kahe gayi hai
 Due to being situated on the arrow of Mithila and many rivers in the name of Mithi, the name of arrow has been considered because of the enjoyment of arrows
 is granth main ganga se lekar himalay ke bich sthit mithila main mukhya 15 nadiyon kii sthiti maani gayi he tathaa unke naam bhi ginaye gayi hai
 Explaining the significance of Mithila, the mithila-mahatmya section of the Old Age Purana states that there is the ultimate sacred arrowhead consisting of 15 rivers between the Ganges and the Himalayas
 yah tirbhukti mithila sita kaa nimicanan he, gyaan kaa kshetra he or krupa kaa peeth he
 Know that this birthplace Mithila is sinless and innocent
 yah ram ko anand dene vaali tathaa mangaladaayini he
 Prayag etc
 is going to give merit in pilgrimage places but is not able to get Rama; But this Mithila is definitely special in all kinds of appeasing Rama
 jaise saket nagari sansar ke kaaran swaroop he vaise hi yah mithila samast anand kaa kaaran swaroop he
 Therefore Maharsighans reside here for the worship of Rama leaving all the parigras
 shrisavitri tathaa shrigauri jaisi dev-shaktiyon ne yahi janm grahan kiya
 This Mithila is the birthplace of Sarveshwareshwari Sreesita ji herself, who will give all the accomplishments by diligently dwelling
 mahabharat main magadh ke baad mithila kii sthiti maani gayi he
 Describing the Magadha Yatra of Sri Krishna, Arjuna and Bhima, it is mentioned that after crossing the Saryu river, crossing eastern Kosala region and then crossing Mahashon, Gandaki and Sadaniira to Mithila
 punah ganga tathaa mahashon ko paar karke magadh main jane kii baat kahi gayi he
 It seems clear from this that at that time Mithila's position in the north of Magadha has been considered
 vajji pradesh mithila ke antargat hi samavisht tha
 Even in this mention of the Mahabharata, the border area of mithila is indicated elsewhere as far as Gandaki in the west and Ganga in the south
 vrihadvishnupurana main mithila kii seemaa kaa spasht ullekh karte hue kaha gaya he ki- That is, there are 24 yojana starting from Kosi in the east to Gandaki in the west and 16 Yojana extending from the Ganges River in the south to the Himalayan forest in the north
 mahakavi chandaa jha ne uparyukt shloke kaa hi maithili roopantaran karte hue mithila kii seemaa bataate hue likhaa he ki Thus, under the mentioned border, the districts of Bihar, presently in western Champaran, East Champaran, Shivhar, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa and Khagaria district The entire area and partial area of bhagalpur district comes
 yah seemaa pracheen ullekhon ke anusaar he sambhawatah kosi kii atyadhik prasiddhi tathaa aniyantrit failaav ke kaaran bhi purvi seemaa kosi ko mana gaya he
 There has been no fixed route to Kosi before the dam was built
 purvi bihar ke sabhi kshetron se praayah kosi bahi he
 Therefore, the whole of eastern Bihar has been a natural part of Mithilanchal before the commencement of West ie West Bengal from Mahananda River
 vrihadvishnupurana main ganga tathaa himalay ke bich sthit mithila ke antargat mukhya 15 nadiyon kii sthiti bataayi gayi he
 Their names are as follows: - ye sab apekshaakrit tatkaaleen badi nadiyon ke naam hai; parantu inke atirikt bhi mithilanchal main anek choti-choti nadiyaan pracheen samay se aaj tak anwarat pravaahit hai or mithila ke 'tirbhukti' naam ko sarthak kar rahi hai
 Apart from being a special place related to shriram-sita, Mithila Devadhidev has been particularly famous as a place of worship of Mahadev
 vrihad vishnupurana ke anusaar yahan ke antarvarti pramukh shivlingon ke naam is prakaar hai:- The names of Sinhasevara Mahadev and Kameshwar Linga have been taken with utmost reverence, mentioning the bordering Shivalingas in the sequence of Mithila Parikrama
 is prakaar yahan ekadash shivlingon ke naam pariganit kiye gayi hai
 In the past, it has been said that after paying obeisance to Sinhasevara Mahadev, starting the circumambulation and going back to Simhaeshwar Mahadev and completing the rules and going home

 kahin hamaari disha hi to galat nahin he? kya sachmuch chimo or radio cancer ke kaaran par hi atek karti hai? After all, what is the root cause of this cancer? Let me tell you, in 1923, Dr
 Otto Warburg discovered the root cause of cancer
 unhone apane prayogon se siddh kar diya tha ki hamaare cells main oxigen kii kami hone ke kaaran ve fermentation dwaara respireshan karne lagate hai or ve cancer cells main parivartit ho jate hai
 Lactic acid is formed in the fermentation process, so the ph of the body becomes acidic in cancer

 unhone is gyaan kii roshni se puure vishwa ko jagamaga diya tha
 The main thing revealed in this whole research is that a mixture of linolenic acid and sulfur-rich protein is the first requirement for cancer treatment and good health
 isliye unhone naye prayog karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He started mixing linseed oil and cheese with cancer patients
 teen maheene baad unke blad semples liye gayi
 The results were staggering
 dow budwij dwaara ek mahaan khoj ho chuki thi
 The first sign of success in treating cancer had been waved
 cancer ke rogi urjavan or swasth dikh rahe the, unki ganthe choti ho gai thi, ve cancer ko parrast kar rahe the
 He proved the magical and amazing effects of linseed oil and cheese to the world
 is tarah varshon kii research ke baad dow budwig ne alsi ke tel, paneer, jaivik falon or subjiyon ke jeus, vyaayaam, surya ke prakaash aadi ko mila kar cancer kaa upachaar viksit kiya
 With this treatment, he has treated more than 2500 cancer patients for many decades, in which he got 90% success
 kai netaa or nobel puraskaar samiti ke sadsy unhen nobel puraskaar dena chaahate the par unako dar tha ki is upachaar ke prachlit hone or manyata milane se 200 billian dollars kaa cancer vyavsaay raaton raat dharaashahee na ho jaye
 That's why Budwig was told that you have to include chemotherapy and radiotherapy in your treatment as well
 lekin unhone sashart diye jane vaale nobel puraskaar ko ek nahin saat baar thukraayaa
 She used to say that chemo and radiotherapy work in the opposite direction of my treatment
 yah sab dekhakar cancer vyavsaay se jude manhagi cancerrodhi davaaiyaan or radiotherapy mashine banane vaale sansthaanon kii neend haraam ho rahi thi
 They feared that if this treatment is prevalent then who will buy their medicines and chemotherapy machines? Because of this, all multinational institutions started plotting many conspiracies against him

 As a result, he had to leave his post, was stripped of his government label and the publication of his research papers was also banned

 You might be thinking that the treatment method of Dr
 Johanna is so effective and miraculous, so why it is not so popular
 yah vastav main insaani laalach kii paraakaashtha he
 Imagine if all the cancer patients started recovering from linseed oil and cheese, then there would have been a huge loss of multinational companies making expensive medicines and radiotherapy machines
 isliye unhone kisi bhi had tak jaakar dow johana ke upachaar ko aam aadmi tak nahin pahunchane diya
 The medical curriculum never allowed his treatment to be included

 The golden period of the Indian comics industry, which has been struggling with the increasing competition from the growing satellite television and video game industries, is struggling in today's era

 haalaanki industry dwaara bharat main prastut kiya gaya zyaadaatar vishay pashchim varg ke the
 At the same time, until the 1960s, only children of elite families could enjoy comics
 lekin 1990 ke dashak tak in sabhi ne bhartiya bazaar main khud ko sthapit kar liya tha
 Broadly, Indian comics development can be divided into four stages
 lagbhag 1950 ke dauraan main pashchim jagat ke syndicate prakaashan apane strip comics da fentum, mandrek, flash garden, rip kirbi ko bhartiya bhashaa main anuvaadit kar pesh kiya gaya
 This comics success almost forced many publishers to follow these titles

 In this, the properties, measurements and relative position of the points, lines, planks and solids are studied in their space
 jyamiti, gyaan kii sabase pracheen shakhaon main se ek he
 Geometry is that branch of mathematics in which the study of points, lines, curves, planes, etc
, is studied
 bhoomi ke naap sambandhi kaaryon se is vigyaan kii utpatti hui, isaliye is ganit ko bhumiti bhi kehete hai
 Initially this study was limited to the properties of lines and areas surrounded by lines, due to which geometry is also named Geometry
 bharat main yagyavediyon ke nirmaan kaary main ganitagyon kaa dhyaan jyamiti ke adhyayan kii or aakrisht kiya, unke adhyayan main kshetrasmiti kaa put adhik tha
 Historians believe that Indians knew such relationships as 32 + 42 = 52, 1,000 years before Christ, but they did not study such relationships in any other way except for some similar small equations
 isa se lagbhag 600 varsh purv rome ke ganitagya pithagoras ne is sambandh kaa bade tarkpurna dhang se adhyayan kiya or yah bataaya ki ek samakon tribhuj main karn par kaa varg anya bhujaaon ke upar virgon ke yogafal ke baraabar hota he
 Although the study of geometry started almost simultaneously in all the old civilized countries, such as Egypt, Babylonia, China, India and Greece, but no other country has progressed as much in this science as Greece
 isa se lagbhag 300 varsh purv yunaan ke ek ganitaj euclid ne us samay tak jitne tathy gyaat the un sabko bade tarkpurna dhang se krambaddh kiya
 He tried to prove other facts on the basis of known facts
 is prakaar tathyon ko krambaddh karne par vah kuch aise praarambhik tathyon par pahunchaa jinako siddh karnaa kathin he
 Well they seem very clear
 ye tathy itane saral hai ki euclid ne inhen swayansiddh maan liya or inhen swayan tathy kaha he
 The proof of theorems of geometry is dependent on these facts
 ve tathy nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Those things, which are equal to the same thing, are also equal among themselves
 2
 yadi baraabar vastuon main baraabar vastuen jod di jaayan to yogafal baraabar hote hai
 3
 If equal items are subtracted from equal items then the remainder are equal
 4
 baraabar vastuon ke samaan gune baraabar hote hai
 5
 If two lines intersect the third line and the sum of the inner angles of one side is less than two right angles, then where the joint is less, the two lines will meet at a point when extended
 6
 isi prakaar rachanakaarya main bhi ek rachana se duusari rachana kar sakate hai, parantu ant main kuch aisi rachanaaon par pahonchte hai jinka prayog duusare prayogon par nirbhar nahin karata
 These compositions can also be taken forward by considering themselves
 ve Apart from these, they do not accept any other facts without proving them
 uparyukt paanch swayan tathyon main se chaar to itane saral tathaa sapsht hai ki inhen siddh karnaa apane haath ko apana siddh karne ke baraabar he, parantu paanchavaan swayantathy swayansiddh sa prathit nahin hota
 Mathematicians objected to this fact as axiomatic and tried hard to prove it
 inhen yatnon ke falswaroop bade bade avishkaar hue
 Similarly, new geographical terms are mentioned in geometry
 ek shabd kii paribhaasha duusare shabdon kii paribhaasha par nirbhar karti he
 Finally, let us see that these definitions are based on the definitions of point, line and plane
 euclid ke anusaar samtal vah he jisamen lambaai chaudaai ho, parantu motaai na ho
 Many people are skeptical of this definition as well, but a little reflection will make it clear that the definition is correct
 udaahranarth, yadi kaanch ke ek baratan main do aise taral padaarth bhar die jaayan jo aapas main na milte ho to jab ve sthir ho jaayan tab ham dekhgen ki ek tal donon padaarthon ko alag karata he
 It does not have thickness
 yadi hoti to donon taralon ke bich aisa sthaan hota jisamen na neeche kaa padaarth hota na upar kaa, parantu aisa asambhav he
 This example would have made it clear that the floor does not have thickness
 isamen keval lambaai or chaudaai hi hoti he
 Similarly, looking at the shade of a flat wall in the sun, we can say that the line does not have width
 rekha tal main sthit he, at: tal kii motaai rekha kii motaai hui
 Therefore the line has neither thickness nor width, only length
 rekhaayen ek bindu par milti hai to rekha kii chaudaai bindu kii lambaai hui, arthath bindu main na lambaai hoti he, na chaudaai, motaai
 There is only space
 sabhi is baat se parichit honge ki jyamiti main tribhuj, varg, vrutt, shanku, belan ityadi ke gunon kaa adhyayan hota he1 puraane samay main kuch prashnon ne ganitagyon ko kaaphi uljhaae rakhaa
 The solutions to those questions gave a lot of thought, there is no doubt in this, like making a cube whose cube is twice the given cube
 us samay rachana kaa arth patari or parkaar kii sahaayta se hi rachana karnaa samajha jaataa tha
 The second question was to make a square whose area is equal to the area of the given circle
 teesraa prashn tha ki ek die hue kone ko teen baraabar bhaagon main baantna
 This work is impossible with track and compass, but can be done by other means
 in prashnon ne shatabdiyon tak ganitagyon ko vyast rakhaa
 Mathematics was greatly benefited by his deliberations, no doubt
 ek shanku ko kisi samtal se kaatane se jo dirghavritt, paravalay, tathaa atiparavalay vakr banate hai unke gunon kaa bhi unaniyon ne adhyayan kiya
 These studies may have helped Kaplan in finding his rules
 15veen shatabdi tak jyamiti main praaia: naap sambandhi gunon kaa hi adhyayan hota tha, parantu uske baad aise gunon kaa bhi adhyayan hua jo naap par nirbhar nahin karte; jaise yadi do tribhujon ke sheershabindu ek teen bindugami rekha par hon to sangat bhujaayen ek rekha par milengi
 This goal attracted the attention of mathematicians to another type of geometry called projectional geometry
 yadi ham kisi drishy ke chitra par dhyaan den to anubhav karte hai ki use dekhakar drishy kaa puraa gyaan ho jaataa he
 But in the picture, the circle is not a circle, neither all the parallel lines are parallel, neither the right angle is the right angle, but sometimes the right angle is seen to be a right angle, sometimes more angle; Nevertheless, there are some such qualities in the scene that even after changing the shapes, they get complete knowledge from the picture
 ye gun nishchar kehalaate hai
 Similar properties are studied in projectional geometry
 maan len, ek bindu ba or ek chaturbhuj k kha ga gha diya hua he
 If the lines joining each point of the quadrilateral are drawn from point b and extend them and then cut these lines from a plane, a drawing will be made on this plane
 vah is chaturbhuj kaa prakshep tathaa yah prayog bindu ba ke saapeksh roopantaran kehalaayegaa
 Similarly, by taking a second point, you can also interpolate this interpolation relative to it
 jo gun nahin badalte unhen prakshep dwaara kisi saral bahubhuj main badalakar adhyayan karte hai
 These properties will also be good for the original polygon
 saath hi kai roopantaran milakar ek roopantaran prayog ke samaan hote hai
 The study of these experiments is also a part of this geometry
 yadi kisi gole yaa vrutt kaa centre k ho tathaa trigya tra ho or yadi kisi bindu ba kii centre k se duuri r ho or yadi r' duuri par rekha k ba main ba' doosraa bindu ho, jahaan r1 tra2 to ba ke kisi bindupath ke sangat ba' kaa bhi path hoga
 The path of b is called the inverse of the path of B
 prayek kshetra pratilomon kaa adhyayan hi is shakha kaa dhyey he
 The 5th axiomatic fact of Euclid has been given above
 ise swayansiddh maanane ke liye ganitagya kabhi taiyaar nahin hue, balki unhone ise siddh karne ke bade bade ytn kiye; parantu kaai santoshjanak uttar nahin mila
 Mathematics developed a lot as a result of research and a geometry was invented which created a complete revolution in geometry
 euclid ne samtal par hi sab vivechan kiye, parantu ab har prakaar ke talon par alag alag vivechnaayen hoti hai
 Its interpretation is difficult, so for this, the readers should look at the special books on this subject
 17veen shatabdi ke madhya main francisi ganitagya decort ne jyamiti main bijganit kaa prayog kar ise bahut shaktishaalee bana diya
 He first took two cutting lines, called axes
 kisi bindu kii in rekhaon ke samaantar naapi hui duuri do sankhyaon ya r se uskaa sthaan nishchay kiya
 These lines are called the coordinates of the point
 in nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se prayek jyamitiya tathy ko bijaganitiya sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 This geometry developed in many directions
 pehali dasha main to jyamiti kaa vyapak rup saamne aayaa, jaise ek ghaat kaa sameekaran ek saral rekha pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equation of two powers represents a conic
 isi prakaar teen, chaar or ucchtar ghaaton ke samikarnon kaa adhyayan hone laga or unke sangat vakron ke gunon kaa vivechan pehle se bahut saral ho gaya
 It became possible to study not only the curves of the floor but also the curves of the recess
 iske liye ek bindugami teen samatalon se kisi bindu kii duriyon ya r l na uskaa sthaan nishchit karte hai or prayek bindupath ko ya, r, l main ek sameekaran dwaara pradarshit karte hai
 By considering these equations, the properties of the planes and curves are easily studied
 duusari disha main rachana sambandhi prashnon kaa hal tathaa kriyaayein bahut saral ho gayi
 These verbs depend only on the solution of some equations, in which very broad questions are easily solved; For example, if the line intersects a curve = o, the solution of both these equations will determine the location of their intersection points
 yadi in samikarnon ke mul vaastavik hai, to rekha vakr ko katati he
 If equal, the line touches the curve
 yadi kaalpanik hai to rekha vakr ko nahin katati, parantu ham yah kah sakate hai ki rekha vakr ko sadaiv do binduon par kaategi, chaahe bindu vaastavik yaa sampati hon, athwa kaalpanik hon
 Similarly, facts can be given in a very broad form, which was not possible in ordinary geometry
 teesri disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne vimiti ko vyapak kiya
 Two numbers are Y, r in two dimensions and three numbers determine the position of a point in three dimensions
 ab ganitagyon ke saamne yah prashn uthaa ki chaar sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va yaa paanch sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va, ha kya pradarshit karengi
 Mathematicians thought very easily in their minds that abstract four numbers would determine the position of a point in four dimensions and five numbers in five dimensions
 is prakaar unhone sa vimitiyon kaa vichaar bhi acchhee tarah soch liya
 He does not mean whether there is any example of him in the earthly world
 instine ne avashya is vichaar kaa apane saapeksh siddhant main upyog kiya or vimiti ke vichaar kaa spashtikaran kiya
 Now use this idea of high dimensionality to solve some difficult problems in untapped mathematics
 jaise kisi chal taral padaarth ke bhinn bhinn kanon kaa sthaan, saat sankhyaon se pradarshit karte hai
 They are A, B, C, its initial position, and three velocities, which are parallel to Y, R, l axis, and time, this can be solved by considering the question of seven dimensions
 chauthi disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne sankhyaon kaa vyapkikaran kiya or kaalpanik sankhyaon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 Concepts such as hypothetical points and imaginary curves, etc
, made geometry very important, which further helped in generalization, such as the conic circle going from two imaginary points at infinity, etc
 iske atirikt jyamiti kaa vivechan bhinn bhinn prakaar ke nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se hone laga, jaise samghaateey nirdeshaank, trikoniya nirdeshaank, sparsheey nirdeshaank ityadi
 Almost 50 years after the use of coordinates, calculus was also used in geometry
 is prayog ne jyamiti main nai nai vichaardhaaraen utpann kin
 These are called differential geometry

 He said that Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly as an elected member
 Patan is its assembly constituency
 kisi ghatana ke hone kii sambhaavna ko prayikta yaa sambhavyata kehete hai
 It is used extensively in the fields of statistics, mathematics, science, philosophy etc
 saadhaarant: sambhavyata kaa sambandh us ghatana se he jiske na hone kii apeksha ghatit hone ko adhik aashaa he
 In this sense it is different from Shakya
 ghatana shakya tab hoti he jab uske ghatane main virodh nahin hota
 It is neither possible nor feasible to have 'mother of the Mother'
 'swarna parvat' sambhavya nahin he, parantu shakya he
 In the scientific sense, probability is related to an event which is neither definite nor impossible
 yadi nishchit gyaan kaa pratik 'ek' mana jaae or nishchit gyaan ke abhaav kaa 'shunya', tab sambhavyata kaa sthaan inhen '0' or '1' ke madhya nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 There are basis of probability
 jevens ne sambhavyata ke aadhaar ko aatmagat mana he
 He considered faith to be the basis of probability
 yah mat doshayukt bataaya gaya he, kyonki sambhavyata kaa sambandh pariman se he or vishwaas ko maatra main vyakt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 It is also not appropriate to consider belief as the basis of probability because probability is calculated and this calculation is not possible with confidence
 vah isliye ki jis vastu main vishwaas hota he uskaa kabhi to anubhav nahin hota or kabhi kabhi ek anubhav par hi do vyaktiyon kaa vishwaas bhinn bhinn ho jaataa he
 Probability is related to arrival
 aagaman nirikshan or pareekshan par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to call probability purely subjective, because inspection and testing is thematic
 inhen uparyukt trutiyon ke kaaran kuch vichaarkon ne sambhavyata ko vishaygat pramanit kiya he
 Probability depends on experience
 anubhav vishaygat he
 Based on experience, we believe in the occurrence or not of an event
 yah vishwaas aatmagat he
 Hence the conclusion that the basis of probability is both experience and belief
 sambhavyata kii gananaa ganit dwaara hoti he
 There are different types of events
 at: unki sambhavyata kii gananaa kii bhi reeti bhinn bhinn hai
 To find the probability of a simple event, divide the probability of the occurrence by the entire number of the number of times the event occurred
 taash kii 52 pattiyon main is baar khinchne se kaala paan kaa badshaah nikle, isaki sambhaavna jaanane ke liye niyam he : Therefore, the probability of black king being king is 1 / 52
 saath saath nahin ghatanevaali do ghatnaon main ek ghatana ghatane kii sambhaavna kii gananaa ke liye unki alag alag sambhaavna ko jod dena padataa he
 In 52 cards of cards, there is a possibility of one slave and emperor coming out: isi prakaar do swatantra ghatnaon ke saath saath hone kii sambhaavna unki alag alag sambhaavnaaon ko aapas main guna karke nikaalte hai
 Rainbow and rain are likely to occur along with these two independent events: yahi niyam adheen ghatnaon ke saath bhi lagu he
 To find the probability of the truth of the evidence collected, we subtract the product of its impossibilities from 1
 anyaanya gavaahon dwaara bataai gai ghatana ke satya hone kii sambhaavna is prakaar nikaali ja sakati he : ek gavaahi main satya hone kii sambhaavna jab 5 / 6 he to usamen satya hone kii asambhaavna hogi
 Then the probability of being true in the second testimony is 2 / 3 when it is unlikely in donon kii alag asambhaavnaaon ke gunanfal ko 1 main se ghataane par uttar hoga - Thus, the probability of the incident stated by the witnesses to be true will be 17 / 18
 is prakaar sambhavyata kii maatra sankhya ke aadhaar par hi nikaali jaati he
 Therefore, if the number is not calculated completely, the quantity of probability cannot be determined
 sambhavyata kii gananaa ke uparaant jis nishkarsh kii prapti hoti he vah ausat ke liye hi satya hota he
 In other words, say that the probability is true for the average

 yadhyapi ISO swayan ko ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kahata he, isaki maanak sthapit karne kii kshamta, jo ki praay vidhi ban jate hai, yaa to samjhauton ke dwaara, yaa phir rashtriya maan; yah isko gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon se adhik shaktishaalee banaata he
 In practice, it is working like a faculty or short-term organization, which has strong links with governments
 
 The logo or symbol of this organization is American English and French in two official languages
 isamen ISO akshar bhi sammilit hai, jinase yah praayah janaa jaataa he, jo ki isaki sankshipti he
 Rather this abbreviation is derived from the Greek / Greek word ἴσος, which means equal
 yah maanate hue ki sanghathan kaa bhinn bhashaaon main bhinn sankshipti banegi, yah tay kiya ki ek sarvyaapee sarvamaanya naam ISO hi chalaaya jaae
 This in itself proves the purpose of this organization
 ISO ke mukhya utpaada hai anterrashtriya maanak
 Only published by ISO are: Technical Reports, Technical Specialization, Publicly Available Specialties, Technical Corrigendum, and and Guide
 anterrashtriya maanak kaa roopakar hota he ISO xxrep 5 n sheershak, jahaan xxrep 5 n he maanak sankhya, xxrep 4 y he prakaashan kaa varsh, evam sheershak bataata he vishay
 yadi maanak sanyukt takneekee samiti JTC1 ke kaary kaa parinaam he, to IEC bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 ASTM is also incorporated into standards developed in collaboration with ASTM International
 dinaak evam IS kaa prayog apurna yaa aprakashit maanakon ke liye aprayogneey he, evam kuch paristhitiyon main prakashit kaary kaa sheershak bhi chhona ja saktaa he
 a technical report is issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has generally collected data of a different type from the published international standard, such as references or interpretations
 inaki namakaran pratha maanakon kii bhaanti hi he, keval TR lagaaya jaataa he IS ke sthaan par, report ke naam se pehle
 For example takneekee vishesheekaran ko tab rachit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki "sambandhit vishay abhi bhi vikaas kii sthiti main hi he, yaa kisi anya karanvash bhavishya main kisi anterrashtriya maanak ko prakashit karne kii sahmati kii sambhaavna hoti he" 
 Publicly available specialties can be an "intermediate specialization that has been published prior to the development of the full international standard", or, a 'bicameral' publication in the IEC, published in collaboration with an external organization
 " Naming is done like a technical report
 udhaahrantah ISO sometimes also issues technical / technical corrigendum
 ye vartmaan maanakon ke sanshodhan hote hai, jo ki kshudra takneekee / paribhaashik trutiyon, prayogneeyata sudhaar yaa simit tareeke se prayojyata badhaane hetu kiye jate hai
 Often these are issued with the hope that the affected standard will be either quoted or withdrawn until their next scheduling overview
 ISO path-pradarshak ardh-maanak hote hai, anterrashtriya maanakeekaran se sambandhit vishyon ko liye hue
 These are named in the "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : title", eg ISO pralekh prakashnadhikaar surakshit hote hai, evam ISO adhiktar kii pratiyon kaa mulya letaa he
 However, most of the values are taken only in electronic form
 yadhyapi upyogi, parantu in pralekhon ko prayog karte hue yah dhyanyogy he, ki inaki prachur maatra main bhi parivartan kii sambhaavna he, isse pehle ki yah maanak hi naa ban jaae
 Some standards are provided free of charge by ISO and its official United States Representative and International Electrotechnical Commission
 ISO ke 157 rashtriya sadsy hai, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO has three membership categories: bhagidaar sadsy "P" yaa pi sadsy kehalaate hai, jabaki anupaalan karne vaale "O" yaa o sadsy kehalaate hai
 The fact that many iso-created standards are universal, ubiquitous; On many occasions, the general use of "ISO" has been inspired to describe a product that conforms to the standards
 iske kai udhaaharan hai: To deal with the consequences of abundant coverage in the areas of standardization, and the tasks related to information technology; a Joint Technical Committee constituted from ISO & IEC or International Electrotechnical Commission known as ISO / IEC JTC1
 yah asi pratham samiti he, evam ajtak ek hi he
 Its official order is to develop, maintain, promote IT standards for business and user requirements in worldwide markets
 vartmaan main 18 up-samitiyaan hai :- Membership of ISO / IEC JTC1 is restricted to the same extent as that of its parent organizations
 ek sadsy yaa to bhagidaar yaa prekshak ho saktaa he
 The only difference between the proposed standards and other products is the ability to vote
