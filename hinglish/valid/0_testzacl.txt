 The group of these stars is called the main category
 jo taare is shrenee se bhinn hai, ve do prakaar ke hote hai : shwet vaaman or trumpler taare
 The light of the trumpler stars varies in proportion to their mass
 yadi ek hi punj kii mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet-vaaman kii jyotiyon ore ardhvyaason kii tulana karen, to yah paaya jaataa he ki shwet vathan mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut kam jyetishman hota he or uskaa ardhavyas bhi bahut kam hota he
 Therefore, the substance of white vamana should be very dense
 dwitiya-lubdhak shwet-vaaman shrenee kaa pratinidhi mana jaataa he
 Its mean density is about 6
8 j 104 grams per cubic cm
 yahi yaheen, yadi ek hi prabhavi taap ke mukhya shrenee ke taron or shwet vaaman kii jyotiyon kii tulana karen, to shwet vaaman mukhya shrenee ke taare kii apeksha bahut hi kam jyetishmaan hota he
 These variations are indicative of differences in the internal composition of the stars

 The lead actors of this film are Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan
 is film ko rashtriya film puraskaar main sarvshereshth film ke alaava filmafere puraskaron main chah shreniyon main puraskrit kiya gaya tha
 The film begins from the present and Dr
 Bhaskar Banerjee, an expert in cancer, is being awarded the literary award that he created a novel like Anand and Dr
 Bhaskar Banerjee in his cleanliness says that it is some pages of his diary And he is not an author and this novel is based on true events
 ab film ateet main chali jaati he jab ek jujharu doctor bhaskar bannerjee mumbai kii jhoparpatti main marizon kii dekhbhaal kar rahaa he or dekhtaa he ki bhukhmaree or badahaali is had tak faili huyi he ki vah kisi ke liye kuch bhi karne main aksham he
 At the same time, his friend Dr
 Prakash Kulkarni has a frozen hospital, which also sees the sick patients and gets good amount of money from them while the poor patient, who keeps sending Bhaskar, gets all the tests done without any money
 ek din prakaash ko dilli se uske ek stri rog visheshgy dost dow trivedi kaa khat aata he ki vah apane dost anand ko uske paas bhej rahaa he
 Prakash met Anand a few years ago and became his good friend
 anand ko antadiyon kaa cancer he or yah baat vah jaanata he ki zyaada se zyaada vah chah maheene hi zindaa rahegaa
 When Prakash and Bhaskar are sitting in Prakash's office, Anand threatens and starts his joking habit, which makes Bhaskar Banerjee angry and he asks Anand that he knows what
 If there is sickness, Anand tells him that he has cancer and that he will live for six months at most
 yah sunakar bhaskar anand kaa qaayal ho jaataa he ki yah maaloom hote huye bhi ki vah kuch hi dinon kaa mahamaan he, anand itnaa zindadil he
 Anand now lives at Bhaskar's house and somehow discovers that Bhaskar loves a girl Renu but does not dare to express this love
 anand ek pahalwaan kii madad se renu kii maan se milakar bhaskar or renu kaa rishta pakkaa karvaa letaa he lekin renu kii maan ko yah bataa detaa he ki bhaskar or renu kii shaadi main vah nahin rahegaa
 Meanwhile, Anand also finds Isa Bhai Suratwala, an artist working in the theater and Anand learns some dialogues and tapes them in Bhaskar's tape recorder
 ab anand kii tabiyat din par din girti jaati he or ek din vah bistar par let jaataa he
 Bhaskar goes to a homoeopathic doctor in search of some charisma and leaves Prakash and Renu to take care of the joy behind him but by the time he returns, the joy is dead and the joyful taped dialogue in the background
 It is going on and this is where the film ends

 The axis of the rotational frame taken in it is connected to that body and is parallel to the main inertia axes of the body
 islar sameekaran, sadish ardharakhik pratham order vaale saadhaaran avakal sameekaran hote hai
 The general form of Euler equations is the following- jahaan m lagaaye gayi balaghurna hai, i jadtwaghurna matrix he, ω mukhya akshon ke saapeksh koniya veg he
 The above equations in 3D main perpendicular axes form the following: jahaan Mk aropit balaghurna m ke ghatak hai, Ik mukhya jadtv aghurna aksh i ke ghatak hai or ωk koniya veg ω ke ghatak mukhya akshon kii disha hai
 Starting with the second law of Eiler, in an inertial reference system, the angular momentum l has a differential differential equal to the charged fault relative to time
 jahaan Iin jadtviya nirdesh tantra main pariklit jadtwaghurna pradeesh he
 Although this rule is universally true, it is not always helpful to solve for the speed of a normal rotational hard body
 chunki Iin or ω donon gati ke dauraan parivartit ho sakate hai
 Therefore, we change the direction of the system in such a way that it remains constant along the rotational body and selects such that its axes are located in the direction of inertial direction
 is nirdesh tantra main kam se kam jadtwaghurna pradeesh to niyat he, jo gananaa ko sugam banaata he
 As explained in the inertia, angular momentum jahaan Mk, Ik or ωk upar varnit kiye gayi anusaar hai
 In the rotational reference system, the time differential is se pratisthapit karnaa chaiye
 Where the following "rot" is representing the rotational instruction system
 jadtviya or ghurni nirdesh tantron main balaghurna se sambandhit vyanjak nimna he : Where q is the rotational direction, which is the perpendicular angular direction corresponding to an angular velocity vector v
 saamne ke chitra main r trigya, m dravyaman evam i jadtwaghurna vaali ek billiard kii gend ko teble ke samaantar is prakaar maarna he ki gend teble par bina sarake hue aage bade 
 In this we want to know at what height f from the base of the ball is applied so that there is no friction force, the ball moves forward without slipping, rolling
 kshaitij disha main lagaaye gayi bal f kaa balaghurna m = - f gend main ghurni twaran paidaa karata he- The fault negative is taken here because it is opposite to the rotation angle φ
 is sameekaran ke alaava, gend par lagaaye gayi bal f ke kaaran uske dravyaman kendra main twaran utpann hot he
 Therefore dhyaan dijiye ki twaran x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}}, teble ke samaantar tathaa bal kii disha main he
 To roll without slipping it is necessary to- is prakaar uparokt sabhi sameekaran milakar gend kii gati kaa teen charon h, φ, tathaa x main varnan karte hai
 Solving these equations together, we get the following information: kisi thos, samang gole kaa jadtwaghurna i = 2 5 m r 2 { \ displaystyle I={ \ tfrac {2}{5}}mr^{2}} hota he
 Keeping this value- r trigya, m dravyaman tathaa i jadtwaghurna vaala ek pahiyaa α kone par jhuke hue samtal par gurutveey twaran g ke prabh se lotni gati kar rahaa he
 
 chunki yah pahiyaa sthaanantarit bhi ho rahaa he, iske dravyaman kaa raikhik twaran bhi ho rahaa he
 In this problem we are assuming that the speed of the wheel is slipping
 atah nat-samtal or pahiye ke bich ek gharshan bal r utpann hota he jo pahiye ko ghumata he, kyonki is bal ke kaaran ek balaghurna m = -r r lagata he
 This force is taken negative because it is opposite to the rotation angle φ
 atah pahiye kii ghurnan gati kaa sameekaran nimnlikhit he- Now consider the displacement of the wheel's center of mass
 pahiye ke dravyaman mg kaa nat-samtal kii disha main avyav f kaa maan F=mgsin he
 This force is acting in the opposite direction to the force of friction
 atah newton kii gati ke dwitiya niyam ke anusaar- Where x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} is the parallelogram acceleration of the wheel
 iske alaava, yadi loton gati bina phisale hue ho rahi he to x ̈ = − r φ ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}=-r{ \ ddot { \ varphi }}} 
 Thus we obtained equations of motion covering three unknown quantities R, φ and x
 in samikarnon ko hal karne par hame yah praapt hota he- From this it can be seen that for a given side-angle α, the maximum acceleration occurs when the mass of the wheel is at most close to its axis
 
 Note that at the same level, if the friction is zero, the acceleration of a body moving on it will be x ̈ = g sin ⁡ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}} = g \ sin}, which is the acceleration of the wheel More than
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki pahiye kii sthitij urja do prakaar kii gatij urja main badal rahi he- ghurnan kii gatij urja tathaa dravyaman kendra ke sthaanantaran kii gatij urja ; jabaki sarakate hue pind main keval ek hi gatij urja hoti he- dravyaman kendra ke sthaanantaran kii gatij urja Musgal is a village in the Pithoragarh district of the Kumaon division under the state of Uttarakhand in Devalathal tehsil of India

 Kano was born into a happy Japanese family
 unke dada apni mehnat ke bal main kamyaabi hasil karne vaale, madhya japan ke shiga shasit praant ke ek sharaab nirmaataa the
 However, Kano's father was not the eldest son of his father and therefore did not inherit this business
 iske bajaay, vah ek shinto pujari or sarkari adhikari bane or saath hi saath unke paas tokio imperial uniwarsity kii duusari aagaamee kaksha main apane bete ko daakhil karne kii paryaapt prabhutaa thi
 Kano was very weak in his childhood, his stature was very low and his weight was not more than one hundred pounds even though he was twenty years old and he was often persecuted by the overbearing
 unhone 17 saal kii umr main us samay jujutsu kaa anusaran kiya jis samay yah kala khatm hone lagi thi lekin unhen isamen bahut kam kamyaabi hasil hui
 This was due in part to the difficulty of meeting a teacher who adopted him as a student
 18 saal kii umr main sahitya kii padhai karne ke liye vishvavidhyalay jane ke samay bhi unhone apane marshall art kaa adhyayan jari rakhaa or ant main unhone phukuda hachinosuke ke bare main suna jo tengin shin'yo-riyu ke guru or keico phukuda ke dada the, jo kaano kii ekmaatr jivit chaatra or duniya main sabase ooncha darja paane vaali mahila judoka he
 Fukuda Hachinosuke is said to have emphasized the technique of formal practice by sowing seeds of Kano's Gurucharan on free practice in Judo
 phukuda ke skool main kaano ke shaamil hone ke ek saal se kuch zyada samay bitne ke baad phukuda biimaar pad gaye or unki maut ho gai
 Kano then became a student of another Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu school of Iso Masatomo who emphasized the practice of pre-arranged methods more than Fukuda
 apane samarpan ke bal par kaano ne bahut jald nipun prashikshak kaa kitaab hasil kar liya or 21 saal kii umr main iso ke sahaayak prashikshak ban gaye
 Unfortunately, Iso soon fell ill and Kano adopted a different style, becoming a student of Ikubo Tsunetoshi of Kito-riu, realizing that he still had a lot to learn
 phukuda kii tarah, aikubo ne mukt abhyaas par zyada jor diya
 On the other hand, in kito-ryu, the emphasis was on the techniques of throwing to a much greater extent than in Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu
 is samay tak, kaano nai takneekon ko taiyaar karne main lage the, jaise - "sholder wheel" or "floating hip" daanv
 haalanki, vah pehle se hi kito-riyu or tengin shin'yo-riyu ke siddhanton kaa sirf vistaar karne kii apeksha usase kahin adhik kuch karne par vichaar kar rahe the
 a major reform of jujutsu was planned in Kano's mind full of new ideas whose techniques were based on very good scientific principles and whose main aim was to develop the bravery of martial arts as well as the body, mind and character of the youth
 may 1882 main, 22 saal kii umr main, vishvavidhyalay main apni snaatak kii oopaadhi ke lagbhag khatm hone par, kaano ne aikubo ke skool ke nau chaatro ko kamakura ke eisho-ji naamak ek buddha mandir main jujutsu kaa prashikshan dena shuru kar diya or aikubo prashikshan main madad karne ke liye saptaah main teen din vahaan aate the
 Although two years passed before that temple was called "kodokan" or "place of teaching" and Kano was not given the title of "master" or master of Kito-riu until that time, it was It is now considered to be the founding of Kodokan
 judo ko vastav main kaano jiu-jitsu yaa kaano jiu-do or baad main kodocan jiu-do yaa keval jiu-do yaa judo ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 In the early days it was also commonly referred to as jiu-jitsu until that time
 "judo" shabd kii jad usee chitralipi se nikali he jahaan se "jujutsu" shabd kii nikali he: "jū", jiskaa matlab iske sandarbh ke aadhaar par "namrata", "komalta", "lacheelaapan" or "aasaan" bhi ho saktaa he
 However, such attempts to translate jū are misleading
 inamen se prayek shabd main jū kaa istemaal "soft method" ke marshall arts ke siddhant kaa ek spasht sandarbh he
 The gentle way is characterized by the indirect application of force applied to defeat the opponent
 adhik vishesh rup se, yah vyakti ke pratidwandvi kii takat ko uske khilaaf istemaal karne or badalati paristhitiyon ke anusaar acchhee tarah dhal jane kaa siddhant he
 For example, his opponent may move aside to attack the attacker and use his power to knock him forward
 Kano saw jujutsu as an incompatible bag of tricks that he wanted to unify according to a theory he found to be the solution to the notion of "maximum capacity"
 keval behatar takat par nirbhar karne vaale jujutsu kii takneekon ko pratidwandvi ke bal ko punarnirdeshit karne, pratidwandvi ke santulan ko bigaadane, yaa behatar uttolan kaa istemaal karne vaale ke paksh main sweekaar yaa asweekaar kar diya jaataa tha
 There are differences in the other symptoms of judo and jujutsu
 jahaan jujutsu kaa matlab komalta kii "kala", "vigyaan", yaa "takanic" he, vahiin judo kaa matlab komalta kaa "rasta" he
 The philosophical motive is hidden in the use of "dō", meaning road, road or path
 yah budo or bujutsu ke bich ke antar ke samaan he
 The use of this word has removed the idea of ancient martial arts whose sole purpose was to kill
 kaano ne judo ko shaareerik, maansik, bhaavnaatmak or naitik rup se khud par kaabo karne or khud kaa sudhaar karne ke ek saadhan ke rup main dekha
 unhone dainik jivan main adhiktam kshamta ke bhautik siddhant kaa bhi vistaar kiya or ise "paraspar samruddhi" main viksit kar diya
 In this regard, judo is seen as a holistic approach to extend life well outside the restrictions of the dojo
 judo ke abhyaasakarta ko judoka yaa "judo abhyaasakarta" ke naam se janaa jaataa he, haalanki paaramparik rup se keval chauthe dan yaa usase ooncha darja paane waalon ko "judoka" kaha jaataa tha
 When the -ka suffix is added to an English noun word, it means a person who specializes in that subject or who has special knowledge of that subject
 chauthe dan se neeche kaa darja paane vaale anya abhyaasakartaaon ko kencu-sei yaa "prashikshu" kaha jaataa tha
 In modern times judoka means a judo practitioner with any level of expertise
 judo shikshak ko senseyi kaha jaataa he
 The word sensei is derived from sen or saki and sei which means the person who came before you
 pashchimi dojo main, dan darje ke kisi bhi prashikshak ko senseyi kahana aam baat he
 Traditionally, that title has been reserved for fourth dan or higher instructors
 paaramparik rup se judo abhyaasakarta safed rang kii vardi pahante hai jise judogi kaha jaataa he jiskaa saamaanya matlab judo kaa abhyaas karne ke liye pahana jane vaala "judo poshaak" he
 Sometimes this word is shortened to only used as 'ge'
 judogi kaa nirmaan kaano ne 1907 main kiya tha or baad main isi tarah kii bardiyon ko kai anya marshall art dwaara apana liya gaya
 The modern Judogie is made of a white or blue cotton fabric with a traction lanyard and a matching white or blue cotton fabric quilt-stitched jacket that is fastened with a belt
 darje yaa pad ko suchit karne ke liye belt yaa kamarband ko aam taur par rang diya jaataa he
 The jacket is made with the intention that it can withstand the pressure of wrestling and hence it is made much thicker than a karate uniform
 judogi ko is tarah taiyaar kiya jaataa he ki is par pratidwandvi ko rokkar rakhane main aasaani ho jabaki karaategi ko barsaati kot banane vaali saamagree se banaaya jaataa he taaki pratidwandvi is saamagree par apni pakad na jamaa sake
 The first suggestion of the use of today's blue Judogie was made by Anton Geisink at the 1986 Maastricht IJF DC meeting
 pratiyogita ke liye, do main se ek pratiyogi ek nile rang kaa judogi pahentaa he taaki nyaayakartaaon, nirnayakartaaon or darshakon ko donon main antar karne main aasaani ho
 japan main, donon judoka ek safed rang ke judogi kaa istemaal karte hai or ek pratiyogi ke belt par paaramparik laal saish chipka diya jaataa he 
 japan ke baahar, naaballig pratiyogiyon kii pratiyogitaaon main suvidha ke liye ek rangeen saish kaa istemaal bhi kiya ja saktaa he, nile rang kaa judogi keval kshetreey yaa ucch stareey pratiyogitaaon ke liye jaruri hota he
 Japanese practitioners and purists despise the use of blue colored judogi
 jabaki judo main vibhinn prakaar ke paitaren, jaise - ludhakna, girnaa, phenkna, baith janaa, galaa ghontna, jodon ko ulajhaa dena or hamalaa karnaa, shaamil hai lekin khaas taur par throwing or groundwork par zyada dhyaan diya jaataa he
 The throwing technique is divided into a group of two types of techniques, one of which is - permanent technique and the other is - sacrifice techniques
 In addition permanent technique is divided into hand techniques, hip techniques and foot and leg techniques
 balidaan takanic ko those in which the thrower falls directly backwards or those in which he falls onto his side main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Ground fighting techniques are divided into attacks against the joints or joint locks, strangleholds or chokeholds and holding or pinning techniques
 judo main ek tarah kii mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas kiya jaataa he jise randori ke naam se janaa jaataa he jiskaa matlab "mukt abhyaas" he
 In Randori, two rivals can attack each other using any of Judo's slapping or grappling techniques
 kata main maarane kii takneekon, jaise - laat maarna or ghunsa maarna or saath hi saath chaaku or talwaar chalaane kii takneekon ko kaayam rakhaa gaya he
 This type of teaching is usually reserved for upper-class practitioners, but is prohibited in competition and is generally prohibited in Randori for safety considerations
 suraksha kii drushti se hi, umr or darje ke aadhaar par galaa ghontna, jodon ko ulajhaa dena or balidaan ke takneekon par pratibandh laga diya jaataa he
 For example, in the United States a person must be 13 or older to use a strangulation technique, and must be 16 or older to use an arm entanglement technique
 randori or khel-pratiyogita ke abhyaas main, jab ek pratidwandvi galaa ghontne yaa jodon ko uljhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he to doosraa pratidwandvi haar maan letaa he yaa use "maat" milti he or is tarah pratidwandvi ko do baar maat de dene se is baat kaa saafe sanket miltaa he ki vah pratidwandvi haar chukaa he
 When this happens, the match is over, and the outlawed player loses and is freed by a strangulation or joint manipulation technique
 kata ke rup hamalaa or bachaav kii purv vyavasthit paddatiyaan hai jiskaa abhyaas judo main judo kii takneekon main maharath hasil karne ke uddeshy se kisi saathi ke saath kiya jaataa he
 More specifically, their objectives include - explaining the basic principles of judo, demonstrating the correct use of the technique, teaching the philosophical principles on which judo is based, allowing the practice of the techniques to be used in competition Is not allowed and preserve those ancient techniques which are historically important but which are now contemporary Neither is not used in judo
 tarah-tarah ke kata kaa gyaan oonja darja paane ke liye jaruri he
 The seven spun recognized by Kodokan in today's times are as follows: kuch aise bhi kata hai jinhen kodocan dwaara aadhikarik rup se manyata nahin di gai he lekin unka abhyaas jari he
 The most prominent example of this is a spun called 'go no Sen no Kata', in which attention is paid to counter attack on the attempted attack
 judo main ek mukt shaileewale mukkebaaji ke abhyaas par jor diya jaataa he jise randori kaha jaataa he jo iske prashikshan ke mukhya roopon main se ek he
 Part of the time of the fight takes place in making the practice of boxing permanent which is called tachi-vaja and the rest of it is on the ground called ne-vaja
 mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas bhi suraksha ke niyamon ke anusaar hi kiya jaataa he jo apane aap keval takneekon kaa abhyaas karne se kahin adhik jeevant hota he jise pehle jujutsuka kiya karte the
 The use of full strength develops the muscles and cardiovascular system physically, and mentally develops strategy and reaction time, and helps the practitioner to learn how to use techniques against an opposing opponent
 judoka ke bich ek aam kahawat he, "judo kaa sabase acha prashikshan judo he
 " mukkebaaji ke abhyaas ke kai prakaar hai, jaise - ju renshu ; or kakaari geico In judo, there are two main stages of fighting: standing or standing phase, tachi-waza; And the ground phase, ne-vaja; Each stage requires its own techniques, strategies, randori, conditioning or adaptation, etc
 khai ko paatane ke liye "sankramanakalin" takneekon kaa vishesh prashikshan bhi diya jaataa he
 Judoka can be quite efficient in one phase and slightly weaker in the second stage depending on what interests them most, although most are balanced between the two
 judo main mukaable ke sthaayee or jamini donon charnon ke shaamil hone kii vajah se judoka ko apane sthaayee yaa khadey pratidwandvi ko neeche khinchne or uske baad use jameen par takalif dekar samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii kshamta milti he
 In the standing or standing phase, which takes precedence according to the rules of the competition, the contestants try to bang each other or use the technique of forcing the joints to stand up and strangle / choke / surrender while the rules According to this, it is much less in the standing or standing phase because it is more difficult to use these techniques while standing than in the banging
 Is taken
 haalanki kuch judoka apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane ke saath-saath samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii donon takneekon kaa ekasaath istemaal karne main kaaphi kushal hote hai jahaan samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii takanic kii shuruyaat khadey hone kii sthiti main hoti he or jameen par khatm hoti he
 However, it is prohibited to use the technique of manipulating joints
 neeche giraane kii takanic kaa mukhya uddeshy apane pairon par khadey, gatisheel avasthaa main khadey yaa khatarnaak sthiti main khadey pratidwandvi ko uske peeth ke bal jameen par patake dena he jahaan vah utana prabhavi bhang se harakat nahin kar saktaa he
 Thus, the main reason for dropping or being knocked down is to control the opponent and put himself in an effective position
 is tarah se abhyaasakarta ke paas ek nirnaayak parinaam prastut karne kii adhik kshamta hoti he
 Another reason for knocking down the opponent is to force his body into the ground by forcibly slapping him
 yadi pratidwandvi jabardast bhang se or puri tarah se kaabo karke apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraata he to vah is aadhaar par spasht rup se vah match jeet saktaa he ki usne paryaapt shreshthata kaa pradarshan kiya he, kam prabhaavshaalee bhang se neeche giraane par kam ank diya jaataa he
 Points are awarded to a downed opponent only after standing and knocking down their opponent
 vaigyanik vishleshan or tark par kaano ke gurucharan ke saamanjasy ke saath, maanak kodocan judo adhyaapan nirdhaarit karata he ki neeche giraane kii koi bhi takanic saidhantik rup se chaar charnon vaali ek ghatana he: santulan bigaadna ; body positioning ; execution ; or ant main the finish or coup de grâce 
 prayek charan kaa anusaran pichley charan ke baad kaaphi teji se kiya jaataa he; adarshatah sabhi charnon kaa anusaran lagbhag ekasaath hota he
 Likewise, hitting techniques are not allowed to be used due to a higher chance of injury but the player has to "keep this technique in mind" during training, for example, a long bending fight
 Do not, because in this situation, one can easily be injured by attacking the knees or attacking elsewhere
 pratiyogita main, neeche giraane kii prakriya ke baad jameen par muqabla jari rah saktaa he yaa nahin to pratiyogi jameen par kanoonee taur par apni ladaai samaapt kar sakate hai; pratiyogi ko ne-waja kii shuruyaat karne ke liye bas yun hi jameen par girane kii ijaajat nahin di jaati he
 On the ground, the goal of the contestants is to either lower their opponent by strangling or strangling or entangling his arms or forcing him to surrender
 Hold downs, aatm-raksha, police kaa kaam or sainya hathonhaath muqabla karne ke liye mahatvapurn he kyonki jo vyakti apane pratidwandvi par kaabo kar letaa he vahi vyakti kaaphi aasaani se bachaav yaa hamalaa kar saktaa he
 In judo, if the attempt to hold down is maintained for twenty-five seconds, the person using this technique wins the match
 osakomi ke tahat apane pratidwandvi ko mukhya rup se uski peeth ke bal pakad kar neeche giraane kii koshish kii jaati he or yadi vah saamne yaa bagal main mud jaataa he to mat kaha jayega
 
 uske baad do judoka phir se khadey ho jaaenge or uske baad apana ladaai jari rakhenge yaa ladaai karte rahenge
 According to the rules established in 1905, the opponent was only required to hold his shoulder for two seconds — it is said that a samurai took the same amount of time to reach his knife or sword and defeat the opponent he was holding
 naveen adhik lambi aavashyaktaaen mukaable kii vaastaviktaa se sambandhit ho sakati hai ki senaanee, police adhikari, yaa sainik ko sthiti par niyantran sthapit karne ke liye paryaapt samay main apane pratidwandvi ko gatiheen kar dena chahie
 In judo, sometimes the holding technique can result in the opponent surrendering if the opponent does not have the ability to withstand that grip pressure, or the technique of forcing surrender to maintain the grip Ho
 iske alaava, yadi galaa ghontne yaa bhujaaon ko uljhane kii takanic judoka par baari pad jaae yaa judoka ko dard hone lage yaa chot lag jaae to vah samarpan kar saktaa he
 If a dropped person has wrapped his legs around the lower part of his opponent's body or part of the torso, he is also trying to make his opponent fall as much as his opponent would try him
 To fall down because his opponent cannot stand up and be free until his body is wrapped below a person does not leave him
 apane pratidwandvi ke ird-gird apane pairon ko lapete hue use upar se prabhavi rup se hamalaa karne main asamarth karne ke liye us par kaabo karte samay neeche vaala vyakti apane pratidwandvi par vibhinn akramanakari takneekon kaa istemaal kar saktaa he jisamen galaa ghontna, baajuon ko uljhaana or "body sizars" arthath 'sharir par dabaav daalkar saans lene main takalif paidaa karnaa' shaamil he
 In this condition, which is called "do-osa" in Japanese which means "trunk hold" meaning "to keep pressure on the torso", the person above is not able to control his opponent adequately due to this condition called Osakomi
 is
 upar vaala vyakti apane pratidwandvi ke pairon se bachakar nikalne kii koshish kar saktaa he or badale main use neeche giraane yaa samarpan karne par majaboor kar saktaa he yaa vah apane pratidwandvi ke guard ko todane or khadaa hone kii koshish kar saktaa he
 The person below may try to force his opponent to surrender with the help of his guarding technique or may try to roll over his opponent to climb
 joint lock arthath 'jodon ko uljhane kii takanic' ko aam taur par 'arm-lock' arthath 'bhujaaon ko uljhane kii takanic' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It is an effective combat technique because it allows a judoka to be able to control his opponent by inflicting pain on him or even breaking tangled joints when needed
 apane pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne par majaboor karne ke liye pratiyogita main lagbhag puri takat lagaakar kohni ke jodon ko uljhane kii takanic ke istemaal ko kaaphi surakshit mana jaataa he
 In the past, judo was allowed to entangle the legs, entangle the wrists, tangle the spine, and use a variety of other techniques that have been barred from the competition, taking into account the safety of the players
 yah nirnay liya gaya ki un jodon par hamalaa karne se khilaadiyon ko kai choton kaa saamana karnaa padegaa or isaki vajah se dhire-dhire un jodon kii haalat bigadati chali jaaegi
 phir bhi, kuch judoka abhi bhi anaupchaarik rup se in takneekon ko seekhney or inkaa istemaal karke ek duusare se ladane kaa majaa lete hai jo ki aupchaarik pratiyogitaaon main pratibandhit hai lekin isse sambandhit sambo, brazilian jiu-jitsu or jujutsu jaisi kalaon main abhi bhi inamen se kai takneekon kaa sakriyatapurvak istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Chokes and strangulations are commonly and commonly known as strangulation techniques
 isaki sahaayta se vyakti apane pratidwandvi ko behosh or yahaan tak ki maut kii neend sulaane ke liye galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 The use of strangulation technique causes the blood supply to the brain to be shut down due to pressure on the neck's cervical artery, while using the strangulation technique blocks the airway in front of the neck
 aam taur par in shabdon ko aksar ek duusare kii jagah istemaal kiya jaataa he or zyaadaatar judoka dwaara iske istemaal main aupchaarik rup se antar nahin kiya jaataa he
 In the competition, Judoka wins when his opponent surrenders or falls unconscious, as the opponent may become unconscious in just a few seconds if the strangling technique is used properly, but immediately thereafter There is usually no loss when freed
 ek purnataya vishesh marshall art ke saath-saath judo kaa vikaas ek khel ke rup main bhi hua he
 Judo was first seen in the Olympics at the 1932 Games held in Los Angeles where Kano and about 200 judo students performed
 tokio main yojit 1964 games main judo purushon kaa ek olympic khel ban gaya
 Juda also became an Olympic sport for women in 1988 due to the stubbornness of Rena Kanokogi, an American and many others

 In the 1940s Henry Stone and Yosh Uchida, Cal and SJSU head coaches, developed a weight class system, namely the weight class system, to be used in frequent competitions between schools
 1953 main, stone or uchida ne ek aadhikarik ghatak ke rup main apane wet class system ke saath, judo ko ek khel ke rup main sweekaar karne ke liye ameor athlettic union se ek safal vinati kii
 In 1961, Uchida represented the United States at the IJF meetings in Paris where the IJF adopted the weight class system for all future championships
 ijeef kaa nirmaan zyaadaatar shuruuaati european judo union ke aadhaar par kiya gaya tha jahaan kai saalon tak wet class system kaa bhi istemaal kiya tha
 There are currently seven weight divisions that can be changed by the governing bodies and can also be amended based on the age of the contestants: judo ke paramparaagat niyamon kaa makasad pratibhaagiyon ko chot lagane se bachaana or uchit shishtachar ko sunishchit karnaa he
 Some more rules were added to these rules to make the game more interesting for viewers
 match ke dauraan niskriy rahane yaa avaidh takneekon kaa istemaal karne ke liye dand diya ja saktaa he
 If a participant goes outside the scheduled area of the mat then the fight should be stopped
 yadi groundwork arthath ladaai ke dauraan nirnaayakon or nyaayakartaaon ko kuch vichaar-vimarsh karne kii jarurat padati he to nirnaayak sono-mamaa kahegaa or donon ko apni usee sthiti main ruuk janaa hoga
 When they are done, the judge says Yoshi and the match starts
 sabhi ank yaa dand, nirnaayak dwaara die jate hai
 Judges may take a decision to change the points or penalty awarded by the judge
 andhe logon ke judo kii suvidha ke liye ijeef niyamon main maamuli antar hota he
 The purpose of a judo match is to knock the opponent to the ground with his shoulders
 Fall mainly on the ground on his back; Or by strangling her, strangling or entangling her arms and forcing her to surrender
 inamen se kisi ek liye ank ke rup main ippon praapt hota he jiske baad turant match jeet liya jaataa he
 There are three grades or grades of scoring in judo: Ippon, vaja-ari and Yuko
 Ippon literally means "one point" from which the match is won
 teji se or takat lagaakar ek niyantrit tareeke se pratidwandvi ko zyaadaatar uski peeth ke bal jameen par patakane; paryaapt avadhi tak mat par apane pratidwandvi ko giraae rakhane; yaa pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne par majaboor kar dene ke liye ek ippon diya jaataa he
 Slamming the opponent to the ground with lack of sufficient power or control to be able to get Ippon; Or a vaja-ari is given to keep it on the ground for twenty seconds
 ek waja-ari kaa matlab aadha ank hota he or yadi to waja-ari praapt ho jaataa he to unase ek puraa ank ban jaataa he jo jeet hasil karne ke liye jaruri he
 Yuko is a lower scoring point and is counted as a 'tie-breaker' only; It is not combined with other Yuko numerals
 scoring, lexicographic hoti he; ek waja-ari, kisi bhi sankhya vaale yuko ko maat de detaa he, lekin ek waja-ari or ek yuko, yuko rahit waja-ari ko maat detaa he
 Keeping your opponent on the ground for fifteen seconds earns Yuko points
 yadi neeche giraae rakhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne vaale vyakti ko pehle hi ek waja-ari mil chukaa he, to do waja-ari ke jariye ippon ank praapt karne ke liye use apane pratidwandvi ko keval bees second tak jameen par giraae rakhane kii jarurat he
 With the lack of an Ippon or a vaja-ari points requirement, the opponent may receive a Yuko Point to land on the ground
 tathakthith "skilphul tekdouns" arthath "kushaltapurvak jameen par giraane" kii bhi ijaajat di jaati he lekin iske liye koi ank praapt nahin hota he
 If the total score is the same at the end of the match, then this problem is solved by the Golden Score rule
 golden score ek aakasmik maut vaali sthiti he jahaan match ke samay ke liye ghadi ko phir se set kiya jaataa he or is bich sabase pehle koi bhi ank paane vaala pratiyogi jeet jaataa he
 If no points are achieved during this period, the winner is determined by means of hantei i
e
 ‘the decisive and majority views of the two chief justices’
 judo ke scoreboard par prayek khilaadi dwaara praapt kiye gaye waja-ari or yuko kii sankhya ko dikhaaya jaataa he

 As the best way to prevent injury while being fired, students must be well practiced by sensei to properly use the technique of banging before entering the competition for which they "deserve"

 Thus ecosystems are a unit of interdependent components that divide the same habitat
 paaritantr aamtaur anek khaadya jaal banaate hai jo paristhitiki tantra ke bheetar in jeevon ke anyonyashray or urja ke pravaah ko dikhaate hai
 The term ecosystem was coined in 1930 by Roy Clapham to denote the combined physical and biological components of an environment
 british paristhitivigyaanshasri arthur tansle ne baad main, is shabd ko parishkrut karte hue yah varnan diya "yah puri pranali


 na keval jeev-parisar he, lekin vah sabhi bhautik karkon kaa puraa parisar bhi shaamil hai jise ham paryaavaran kehete hai"
 Tansley considered ecosystems not only as natural units, but also as "mental isolates"
 tansle ne baad main "ecotope" shabd ke prayog dwaara paaritantron ke sthanik had ko paribhaashit kiya
 The main idea of the ecosystem concept is that living organisms influence every other element in their local environment
 ujin odum, paristhitiki ke ek sansthaapak ne kaha:" ek ikai jisamen sabhi jeev shaamil hon jo bhautik vaataavaran ko prabhavit karen ki pranali ke bheetar urja kaa ek pravaah spasht rup se paribhaashit poshan sanrachana, biotic vibhinnata or saamagree chakra ek paristhitiki tantra he
 "the human ecosystem concept is then based on the interpretation of human / nature bifurcation and on the basis that all species are ecologically integrated with each other and with the biotic organisms of their biotopes

 The CBD defines "ecosystem" as: "a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microbe communities and their inanimate environment that function as a functional unit
" " Along with the need to conserve ecosystems, there was a political need to describe them and identify them efficiently
 Vryugdenhil and Sab say that using a physiognomic-ecological classification system can be achieved most effectively because Ecosystems are easily identifiable on satellite images along the region
 unhone kaha ki sambandhit vanaspati ke sanrachana or mausam-tatv, paristhitik data se purit prayek aaparivartak nirdharak hai jo aanshik rup se alag set prajatiyon ko alag karte hai
 This is true not only for plant species, but also for animal species, fungi and bacteria

 Special fauna elements may be added where necessary, such as seasonal concentrations of animals and distribution of coral reefs

 vigyaan ke pariprekshya se, paaritantr asatat ikayan nahin hai jo keval ek "sahi" vargeekaran drushtikon kaa adhikaar par pahchaane ja sakaten hai
 An attempt by Tensley to describe or classify the ecosystem in agreement with this definition must be clear about the observer / analyst investment in classification, including normative reasoning

 Therefore, stochastists view regional behavior at the ecosystem level as a regulatory mechanism rather than at the species level
 Thus, in their view, ecosystems are not regulated by the system itself and feedback mechanism and there is no such thing as a balance of nature

 Evidence of fishes being raised has been found until at least 4,500 years ago, when Sumerians used to raise them in cows or puddles for food
 kintu sambhav he ki yah pratha isse bhi purv prachlit rahi ho

 The walls of large reservoirs are of one to one and a half inch thick slab
 saarvajanik jaljivshaalaon kii dekhbhaal ke liye jal ko aavashyak taap tathaa rasinic sanrachana ko banaae rakhana tathaa jalajeevon ke swasthya, bhojan, rog or parjiviyon se sambandhit samasyaon kaa niraakaran bhi aavashyak hota he
 Where appropriate type of water is available in the required quantity, the water required by machines is easily supplied
 taaja jal nagarpalikaon ke jalaashyon se mil jaataa he, kintu is jal ke jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye prayukt chlorin gas ke avshesh ko pehle alag kar liya jaataa he, kyonki yah gas jalashay ke jeevon ko haani pahunchaati he
 If sea water is necessary for the reservoir, then take water from a place in the sea where there is no dirt coming from the rivers, or falling otherwise
 aise sthanon par bhi tufaanon ke kaaran jal upyog ke ayogy thahar saktaa he, isaliye anek jagahon par aisa prabandh rahata he ki hauj main ek baar bharaa hua jal pun: sanchaarit hota rahata he or maarg main uske chaanane or upyukt banane kii kriyaayein sampann ho jaati hai
 For this purpose, water from the livestock goes through a filter and enters a tank at the bottom
 yahan iskaa rasinic shodhan tathaa tapaniyantran hota he
 To maintain the water temperature regularly, heat or cooling thermodynamic devices are used
 neeche ke hauj se pump mashin jal ko uthaakar phir jeevashaala main pahunchaa detii hai
 There are means of ventilation at appropriate places on the route for the supply of oxygen taken from the water by the organisms and for the removal of the carbon dioxide released in it
 is prakaar kii badi sansthaaon main bhinn prakaar kii jalwoyu main paae janevaale jeevon ke liye ushn, samshitoshna tathaa sheethal, samudri jal ke bhinn bhinn jalashay hote hai
 Similarly, reservoirs of soft water of different temperatures are necessary and different temperatures and different alkaline or acidic waters are also required

 Therefore, the maintenance of these types of livelihoods is relatively simple, although the principles of their care are mainly those that apply in relation to public large livelihoods
 ek mithyaa vishwaas failaa hua he ki sthir jalawaali uparyukt jaljivshaalaon main upasthit vanaspatiyon se jal kaa oxikaran hota rahata he
 Actually, the opposite is true
 vanaspatiyaan bhi raat main, yaa badaliwaale dinon main, jal se usee prakaar oxigen leti or carbon dioxide detii hai jaise jaleey jeev; kintu in jeevashaalaon main vanaspatiyon kii upasthiti se anya laabh hai
 The feces etc
 which come out of the body of fish and other organisms are used as manure for the vegetation and thus the dirt does not get collected in the water
 vanaspatiyon se jalashay kii sundarataa main bhi vriddhi hoti he
 The restoration of oxygen exploited by water by flora and fauna and the removal of carbon dioxide produced by them in water is necessary
 yadi jalashay ke jal or vaayu kaa madhyasth str yathesht vistrut he, to yah kaary swayamev sampadit ho jaataa he
 If this is not the case, it is necessary to expel the air from within the water in the form of micro bubbles by pump or any other solution
 kisi bhi jalashay main yadi jeevon tathaa vanaspatiyon kaa pariman jalwaayu-madhyasth-str ke kshetrafal se santulit rakhaa jaay, to vayusancharan kii vishesh vyavastha kiye bina bhi kaam chal saktaa he

 siclidi jati kii machhliyaan apane andon or bacchon ko bhi suraksha ke liye apane munh main rakhe rahati hai or jitne dinon tak andon main se bachche nahin nikalate utane dinon tak bhojan nahin karti
 The problem of feeding of aquarium fish is not particularly difficult
 machhliyon ke saadhaaran bhojya padaarth or sookshm jalajeevon se inkaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Lava of paddy or bhujia rice has also been found suitable for fishes in domestic animals
 shesh bachaa bhojan jal ko ganda karata he
 Fishes require very little food
 isaliye is bhul kii adhik sambhaavna he ki kam bhojan dene ke sthaan par aavashyaktaa se adhik bhojan diya jaay
 It is always important to keep in mind that as much food is consumed in the reservoir as it can consume
 jaljivshaalaon ke rakrakhaav sambandhi purvokt siddhant machhlee paalane kii sabhi ritiyon par lagu hote hai, chaahe sajaavat ke liye gharon main rakhi janevaali choti jeevashalas hon, yaa bagichon main banaae janevaale hauj hon, athwa bhojan ke liye paali janevaali machhliyon ke pokhare hon
 Governments of almost all countries have made arrangements to maintain adequate fishes in public reservoirs, to keep fish in special fisheries, to conserve their eggs and to raise children
 jahaan sambhav hota he vahaan adon ko machhliyon se alag rakhkar sene or bachche paidaa karne kaa bhi prabandh rahata he
 In this way, any type of fish, small or big, needed to be released in rivers or reservoirs

 At one time this area was under the state of Bengal

 In 1908, Tirhut was separated from Patna and made a division under an order issued in British India
