 The legal status of the Holy See is a complete subject of public international law with equal rights and duties from both states, in state practice and according to modern legal scholars
 yadhyapi holi si, vatican city rajya se alag he, rajya ke rajya ke antarrashtriya kanoon main lambey samay se sthapit mandandon ko puraa nahin karata he; arthath sthaayee jansankhya, ek paribhaashit kshetra, ek sthir sarkaar or anya rajyon ke saath sambandhon main pravesh karne kii kshamta; antarrashtriya kanoon main purna kanoonee vyaktitv ke kabje ke 180 rajyon ke saath apane rajanyik sambandhon se iskaa saboot he, yah vibhinn antar sarkari sanghathanon main ek sadsy rajya he, or yah he ki: "antarrashtriya rajyon ke antarrashtriya samudaay dwaara sammanit kiya gaya or ek antarrashtriya kanoon ke vishay main rajanyik sambandhon main sanlagn hone kii kshamta he or antarrashtriya kanoon ke tahat ek, kai yaa kai rajyon ke saath bandhan samjhaute main pravesh karnaa he jo duniya main shanti sthapit karne or banaae rakhane ke liye kaaphi had tak taiyaar hai
 "note as Graham: antarrashtriya kanoon main holi dekhen kaa yah ajeeb charitra, ek gaiyr-pradeshik sanstha ke rup main, jo ki rajyon ke samaan kanoonee vyaktitv ke saath he, ne professor ian brownli ko "sooyee jansanshay sanstha" ke rup main paribhaashit karne ke liye netritv kiya he
 In addition, Holly sees himself, while claiming an international legal personality, not claiming to be a state
 cardinal jin-lui tauran, purv ke sachivalay rajyon kii holi si ke sambandhon ke sambandh main sachiv, ne rekhaankit kiya he ki hamen satta ke liye unki pyaas ke saath, holi si or iske antarrashtriya kriya ko aatmsaat karne kii pralobhan se bachanaa chahie
 
 unke liye, holi si nishchit rup se antarrashtriya kanoon kaa ek saarvbhaum vishay he, lekin mukhya rup se dharmik prakruti kaa he
 For some writers, the current legal personality of the Holy See is a relic of its leading role in medieval politics
 is prakaar arangio-ruij ne note kiya ki majboot raashtra ke srijan se pehle holi si antarrashtriya kanoon ke vikaas main ek abhinayta rahaa he, or iske baad se antarrashtriya vyaktitv ko banaae rakhaa he
 For others, the international personality of the Holy See only emerges from its recognition by other states
 is arth main, brownli kaa tark he ki "vatican city main apane kshetreey aadhaar ke alaava ek dharmik ang ke rup main holi" ke vyaktitv "prabhaavashiltaa ke siddhant" se utpann hota he, jo ki anya rajyon ne swechha se pavitrataa ko pahchaan liya dekhen, iske saath dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko sweekaar karte hai, or vastav main aisa karte hai, aisi sthiti main jahaan aees cogness kaa koi niyam kaa ulanghan nahin he
 To this end, however, the international personality provided in this way is effective only for those states that are prepared to enter into diplomatic relations with it
 croford isi tarah kaa maananaa he ki holi si ke kanoonee vyaktitv ko sweekaar karne ke liye kai rajyon kii manyata mahatvapurn sakshya he, isliye aaj, isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 For a third group of authors, the international legal personality of the Holy See is mostly based, but not only, on its unique spiritual role
 udhaaharan ke liye, Araujo noton, ki "aam taur par yah samajha jaataa he ki holi si ke antarrashtriya vyaktitv duniya main apane dharmik, naitik or aadhyatmik adhikaar or mishan se ubharkar saamne aate hai, kyonki yah vishuddh rup se loukik maamalon par ek daawey kaa virodh karata he
 This is an incomplete understanding, on the basis that its claim as a subject of international law may be justified, because in his view, the Holy See's claim on international personality can also be justified by the fact that it is being held by other states International law is recognized as a full subject
 letteran sandhi hi is drishy kaa samarthan karne lagata he anuchhed 2 main, italy ne manyata di he ki "antarrashtriya raashtra main holi si kii samprabhutaa isaki prakruti ke anusaar ek antarnihit visheshta he or duniya main iske mishan kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar he
 " ek or samooh ke liye, antarrashtriya kanoon main holi seene kaa kanoonee vyaktitv letteran sandhi se utpann hota he, jo unke vichaar main, catholic carch kii kendriya sarkaar ko antarrashtriya str par pradaan kiya gaya tha
 In this sense, Oppenheim argued that "the first controversial international status of the Holy See was made clear as a result of the Treaty of February 11, 1929, between the Holy See and Italy - the so-called Lateran Treaty of the Lateran Treaty restoring formal membership
" Marks, interrupted in 1871, in the Society of States in the Holy See
 " Oppenheim goes further and denies a separate legal personality for the Vatican City State
 uske liye, holi si ke alaava plus vatican city kaa gathan keval ek antarrashtriya vyakti he; pi dekhen 328: Kunj sharply criticized the scene for it: ek alag sawaal yah he ki kya holi si 1870 ke bich antarrashtriya kanoon kaa vishay tha, jab italy kii rajya ne pope rajyon or 1 9 2 9 main luutane sandhi par hastakshar kiye the
 The United States, for example, suspended diplomatic relations with the Holy See when it lost the Popul state
 isi prakaar openhem kaa maananaa tha ki 1870 main pope rajyon ke kanoonee vyaktitv vilupt ho gayi the
 For him, between 1870 and 1929, "the Holy See was not an international figure," however, "it was the custom and doubtful consent of most states to have quasi-international status", the UN International Law Commission said, nevertheless, That: isi tarah kunj ne tark diya ki: Since 1995, the non-governmental organization Catholics for Choice has advocated against participation in the Holy See in multilateral forums
 yah tark detaa he ki holi si ek dharmik sanghathan he or ek rajya nahin he, isliye, antarrashtriya kanoonon main na to koi vishesh darja hona chahie or na hi bhaag lene kaa adhikaar, rajyon ke samaan sthiti main, antarrashtriya sammelnon main saamaajik, saanskrithik or aarthik maamalon
 No state supports this initiative
 In contrast, the United Nations General Assembly ratified and through its Resolution 58 / 314 on 16 July 2004 promoted the status of the Holy See as an observer within the United Nations

 Meera's devotion was marvelous, who dances with her spontaneous gentle and compassionate lovemaking

 Ramakavya's supreme splendor appeared in the poetry of Tulsidas, the author of "ramcharitmanas", who was the greatest genius of Buddhadev after Buddhadev in the eyes of the scholar Grierson
 par kavy kii drushti se tulsi kaa mahatv bhagavan ke ek aise rup kii pariklpana main he jo maanviya samarthy or audaatya kii ucchtam bhoomi par adhishthit he

 The posts of the best devotee-poet Surdas of Vatsalya and Shringar had the most influence on the later Hindi literature
 is shakha ke kaviyon ne praayah muktak kavy hi likhaa he
 Lord Krishna's child and adolescent form have attracted these poets, so in his poems, there has been a predominance of beauty rather than the glory of Shri Krishna
 praayah sab kavi gayak the isliye kavita or sangeet kaa adbhut sundar samanvay in kaviyon kii rachanaaon main miltaa he
 The tradition of geeti-kavya which flourished by Jaidev and Vidyapati has been developed by these poets

 Unlike any other poet Tulsidas in this branch
 na ullekhneey nahin he tathaapi agradas, nabhadas tathaa praan chand chouhan bhi is shrenee main aate hai
 The propensities of the Rambhakti branch can be accepted by the owner of Ramakavya stream from Ramanand, the lord of the Vaishnava sect
 yadhyapi ramkavy kaa aadhaar sanskrit sahitya main uplabdh ram-kavy or naatak rahen hai
 From the observation of this poetry stream, it shows the following characteristics: - ram kaa swaroop : ramanujacharya kii shishy parampara main shri ramanand ke anuyaayi sabhi rambhakt kavi vishnu ke avatar dasharath-putr ram ke upaask hai

 Explaining the separate importance of knowledge, action and devotion in Rama-poetry, devotion is described as excellent
 tulsi das ne bhakthi or gyaan main abhed mana he : bhagatahin gyanhin nahin kuch bheda
 Although they accept difficult path of knowledge and simple and easy path of devotion
 iske atirikt tulsi kii bhakthi kaa rup vaidhi rahaa he ,vah vedashastra kii maryaada ke anukool he
 folk-mars spirit: Rama's folk-guard form has been established in Ramabhakti literature
 tulsi ke ram maryadapurushottam tathaa aadarshon ke sansthaapak hai
 Ideal characters have been created in this poetic stream
 ram adarsh putr or adarsh raja hai, sita adarsh patni hai to bharat or lakshmana adarsh bhai hai
 Kaushalya is the ideal mother, Hanuman is the ideal servant
 is prakaar ramcharitamanas main tulsi ne adarsh grihasth, adarsh samaaj or adarsh rajya kii kalpana kii he
 Tulsi Loknayak has become a poet due to Adarsh's reputation and his poetry is steeped in the spirit of Lokmangal
 samanvay bhaavana : tulsi kaa maanas samanvay kii viraat cheshtaa he
 In the words of Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi - all his poetry is a great effort to coordinate
 lok or shaastra kaa samanvay, garhasthya or vairaygy kaa samanvay, bhakthi or gyaan kaa samanvay, bhashaa or sanskrit kaa samanvay, nirgun or sagun kaa samanvay, paanditya or apaanditya kaa samanvay ramcharitamanas main shuru se aakhir tak samanvay kaa kavy he
 We can say that Tulsi etc
 Ramabhakta poets have propagated syncretism in all areas of society, devotion and literature
 ram bhakt kaviyon kii bhartiya samskruti main purna aasthaa rahi
 Mythology is the basis of these and is the source of varnasrama system

 Ram's life is so wide and varied that almost all the juices in it are easily expressed

takaaki kajita / arthur bi
 mcdonald There are many constants in physics, about which scientists believe that there is no change in them over time
 in niyantaakon ko bhautikee ke moulik niyatank kehete hai
 Whatever is their value according to our chosen fundamental units, will always remain the same
 aise niyatankon ke kuch udhaaharan ye hai: prakaash kaa veg, arthath vah veg jisase prakaash kii tarangon kaa sancharan shunyakash main hota he; electron kaa aavesh; sarvyaapee gurutvakarshan kaa niyatank, arthath vah bal jisase ek centimetre kii duuri par rakhe ek gram ke do pind ek duusare ko aakarshith karte hai; ooshmaagatiki paimaane par barf vindu, arthath barf ke pighalane kaa taap aadi
 There are also some fundamental physical constants whose numerical values are the same in all unit systems; These are called non-physical physical constants
 in niyatankon ke maanon kaa vistrut vivechan sabase pehle barj ne san 1929 main kiya
 Since the study done by Dunnington in 1939, such study is done every second or third year
 in adhyayanon main sabase acchhee baat yah hui he ki in niyatankon kaa maan na keval uttarottar shuddhta se gyaat kiya ja sakaa he, apitu yah bhi hua he ki inke naveen maan puraane nirdhaarit maanon kii trutiyon ke antargat hi praapt hue hai
 Many scientists have been trying to find the exact value of these constants for a long time
 san 1929 ke pehle prayek niyatank ko ek pruthak samasya ke rup main gyaat kiya ja rahaa tha
 But these constants have interrelations, which can be used to check if there are any inconsistencies in the values of these constants
 udhaahrant:, proton kaa chumbakeey aghurna p prayogon dwaara mapa ja saktaa he
 This magnetic moment can also be manifested by other constants, whose formula is p = eh / p mp c It contains e, h, mp and C, respectively, the charge of the electron, the planar constant, the concentration of the proton and the velocity of light
 in niyatankon kaa maan bhi prayog dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Since there is a possibility of a slight error in measuring, it may be that the number obtained when the values of e, h, mp and c in the formula are not equal to the value of p determined by the experiment
 isaliye in sabhi niyatankon kaa maan is tarah nishchit kiya janaa chahie ki yah antar kam se kam ho
 Here is only one example of this mutual relationship
 isi tarah in niyatankon main or bhi sambandh hote hai
 The largest group of these interrelated constants is the atomic constant
 kuch ko chhodkar lagbhag sabhi niyatank inhen niyatankon dwaara prakat kiye ja sakate hai
 The most important constant, which cannot be revealed by them, is the constant of gravity
 in niyatankon main se kuch aise mukhya niyatank chune jate hai, jinke dwaara duusare niyatankon ko prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 Suppose the number of such prime constants is z
 ab kuch aisi matraayen chuni jaati hai jinka maan prayog dwaara badi yatharthata se mapa ja saktaa he or jinhen in chune hue mukhya niyatankon dwaara prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 An example of one such quantity is the magnetic moment of protons, which is mentioned above
 in chuni hui matraaon kii sankhya kam se kam ya honi chahie
 But if the number of such selected quantities is more than "Y", then we will have more equations than necessary to get the value of these constants
 aisi dasha main yadi ham kinhin "ya" samikarnon main inako rakhen, to ham dekhenge ki gananaa dwaara praapt kiye gaye maanon evam prayog dwaara praapt kiye gaye maanon main antar he
 That is why we should find the value of these constants that the "math values" and "experimental values" of these chosen quantities have a minimum discrepancy
 iske liye in niyatankon ke maan kaa nirdhaaran nunatam-varg-reeti dwaara kiya jaataa he

 The Boston Tea Party was a direct action against the British government by the colonists of Boston, a colony of the British colony of Massachusetts
 16 disambar 1773 ko jab boston ke adhikariyon dwaara karyukt chaay ke teen jahaazon ko britain ko lautne se inkaar kar diya gaya to, upniveshavaasiyon kaa ek samooh jahaaz par savaar hua or chaay ko boston harbar main phenk kar nasht kar diya gaya
 The incident is a major event in American history and other political demonstrations often cite it
 chaay party kii shuruyaat sampoorn british america main chaay adhinium ke khilaaf ek pratirodh aandolan ke dauraan hui thi, jise british sansad ne 1773 main paarit kiya tha
 The colonists opposed it for many reasons, especially because they believed that it had] happened
 pradarshnakariyon ne safaltaapurvak kar yukt chaay ko teen anya upniveshon main utarane se roak diya, lekin boston main samasyaon se ghire shahi rajyapal thomas hachisan ne britain ko chaay lautaane se inkaar kar diya
 They did not directly expect that the protesters would choose to destroy the tea, rather than assuming the authority of the law, in which they were not directly represented
 boston chaay party kaa america kranti ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan tha
 In response, the Parliament enacted a mandatory rule in 1774, which, among other provisions, prohibited the trading of Boston until the British East India Company was paid for the destroyed tea
 iske jawaab main upniveshavaasiyon ne anivaary niyam kaa or adhik pradarshnon ke saath virodh kiya or pehali continental congress kaa aayojan kiya jisane british shashan ko niyam nirast karne ke liye kaha or upniveshavaasiyon ke pratirodh main sahaayta kii
 The crisis escalated and in 1775 the American Revolutionary War began near Boston
 boston chaay party 1973 main british shashan ke do muddon ke virodh ke parinamswaroop hui
 Due to the economic problems of the British East India Company and the ongoing dispute over the authority of Parliament over the British American colonies without an elected representative
 Attempts by the North Ministry to resolve these issues eventually resulted in the rise of the revolution
 jabaki 17veen sadi main europiyanon main chaay lokapriy ho gayi thi, purvi indies se utpaada kaa aayaat karne ke liye pratidwandvi companiyon kaa gathan hua
 In England, in 1698, Parliament gave East India the monopoly of tea imports
 jab chaay british upniveshon main lokapriy ban gai to, 1721 main sansad ne ek adhinium jari karke videshi pratispardhaa ko samaapt karne kii koshish kii, jiske anusaar upnivesh keval great britain se hi chaay kaa aayaat kar sakate the
 The East India Company did not export tea to the colonies
 kanoon banane ke baad company ko apni sari chaay england main nilaamee dwaara thok main bechni thi
 British companies bought the tea and exported it to the colonies where they resold it to traders in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Charleston
 1767 tak, east india company ne great britain main aayaat hone vaali chaay par ] kaa bhugtan kiya
 Parliament imposed additional tax on tea sold for consumption in Britain
 yah dekhte hue ki holland main aayaat hone vaali chaay par dach sarkaar ne kar nahin lagaaya tha, in ucch karon kaa arth yah tha ki british or british america taskari dwaara dach chaay kahin adhik saste daamon main kharid sakate the
 England was the largest market for illicit tea
 1760 tak great britain main taskaron kii vajah se east india company ko prativarsh 400,000 pound kaa nuksaan ho rahaa tha-lekin british america main dach chaay kii bade paimaane par taskari ho rahi thi
 In 1767, Parliament passed the Compensation Act to assist the East India Company in combating the tea brought by smuggling, by which the tax on tea consumption in Great Britain was reduced and the East India Company received 25% on that tea
 Fees were paid back which were re-exported to the colonies
 sarkaar ko is rajasav haani se bachane ke liye, sansad ne 1767 main townshend rajasav adhinium bhi paarit kiya jiske dwaara upniveshon par chaay ke atirikt, nae kar lagaaye gayi
 However, rather than solving the problem of smuggling, the Townshed tariffs gave rise to a new controversy by Parliament over the right to tax the colonies
 1760 main great britain or upniveshon ke bich vivaad armbh hua jab pehali baar, sansad main rajasav ko badhaane ke liye upniveshon par sidhe kar lagane kii maang uthi
 kuch upniveshon, jinhen upniveshon main vigs ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, ne nae karon kaa yah kehete hue virodh kiya ki yah british samvidhan kaa ulanghan tha
 The British and British Americans agreed that according to the constitution,]
 In Great Britain, this meant that taxes could only be levied by Parliament
 upniveshavaasiyon ne sansad ke sadasyon kaa chunaav nahin kiya tha or isliye america vigs ne bahes kii ki upniveshon par is samiti dwaara kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 According to Whiggs, colonists could only be taxed by their own colonial assemblies
 aupniveshik virodh ke parinamswaroop 1765 main stamp adhinium ko nirast kar diya gaya, kintu 1766 main ghoshnaatmak adhinium ke dwaara sansad ne is baat par jor dena jari rakhaa ki uske paas upniveshon ke liye sab maamalon main kanoon banane kaa adhikaar tha
 When new taxes were imposed by the Townshend Act in 1767, the Whigs colonies again responded with opposition and boycott
 vyapaariyon ne ek gaiyr aayaat samjhauta kiya or kai upniveshon main british chaay nahin pine kii shapath dilaai gayi, jabaki naye england main kaaryakartaaon ne iske sthaan par sthaneey lebrador chaay ko badhaava diya
 Smuggling continued, especially in New York and Philadelphia, where tea smuggling was always more than in Boston
 tathaapi, karyukt chaay kaa, visheshkar richard clark or masachusets ke rajyapal thomas hachisan ke beton dwaara boston main aayaat jari rahaa, jab tak ki masachusets vigs ke dabaav main aa kar unhen gaiyr aayaat samjhaute kaa paalan nahin karnaa padaa
 Eventually, in 1770, Parliament repealed the Townshed duty due to the protests, except for the tea tax, which Prime Minister Lord North continued to call the "right to tax Americans"
 karon kaa yah aanshik nirastikaran oktober 1770 tak gaiyr-aayaat aandolan ko samaapt karne ke liye paryaapt tha
 From 1771 to 1773, tea was once again imported into the British colonies on a large scale, at which merchants paid a township fee of 3 pence per pound
 haalanki taskaron kaa abhi bhi neuyork or philadelphia ke bazaaron ke adhikansh bhaag par kabza tha, boston vaid chaay kaa sabase bada ayatak tha
 The Compensation Act of 1767, by which the East India Company received a 25% fee back on tea that was re-exported to the colonies, expired in 1772
 1772 main sansad ne ek nayaa adhinium paarit kiya jisame shulk vaapasi ko 25% kaa teen / paanch kar diya, jisase britain main aayaat hone vaali chaay par vastav main 10% kaa hi shulk rah gaya
 Taxes repealed in Britain in 1767 were also restored by this act and a fee of three pence per pound was imposed on the colonies
 is nae kar ke boj se british chaay kii keemat badhane se bikri main kami aayi
 The company continued to import tea into Great Britain, although a huge stock of produce had been gathered, which no one wanted to buy
 in or anya kaarnon se 1772 ke ant tak britain kii sabase mahatvapurn vittiya sanstha, east india company, gambhir vittiya sankat main pad gayi thi
 The elimination of some of these taxes was a clear solution to this crisis
 east india company ne shuru main townshend shulk ko nirast karne kii maang kii, lekin north mantralay taiyaar nahin hua, kyonki is kaarywahi se yah sandesh ja saktaa tha ki sansad upniveshon par kar lagane ke adhikaar se peeche hat rahi he
 Most importantly, taxes collected from the Townshend duty were used to pay salaries of some colonial governors and judges
 vastav main townshend shulk kaa yahi uddeshy tha
 In the past these officers were paid by the colonial legislative assemblies, but Parliament paid them salaries so that they depended on the British government instead of being accountable to the colonists
 east india company ke godaamon main chaay ke badhate bhandar ko kam karne kaa ek or sambhav upaay tha ki ise saste daamon par europe main bechaa jaae
 is sambhaavna kii jaanch kii gayi, kintu yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya ki chaay kii punah great britain main taskari hogi, jahaan yah karyukt chaay se kam keemat par bikegi
 isliye aisa laga ki company kii atirikt chaay ko bechney kaa sabase achche bazaar america upnivesh honge, yadi ise taskari dwaara laai jane vaali dach chaay kii tulana main sasta banane kaa tarika khoja ja sake
 The solution of the North Ministry was the Tea Act which got King George's permission on 10 May 1773
 is adhinium dwaara britain main aayaat kii jane vaali chaay par east india company kii 25% shulk vaapasi ko behaal kar diya gaya or pehali baar company ko bhi, swayan upniveshon main chaay niryaat karne kii anumati di gayi
 With this, the company could reduce prices by removing the middlemen who bought tea at the wholesale auction held in London
 bichauliyon ko bechney ke bajaay, company ne maal lene ke liye aupniveshik vyapaariyon ko niyukt kiya, badale main vyapaaree kamishan ke aadhaar par chaay bechate the
 In July 1773, tea merchants were elected in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charleston
 chaay adhinium dwaara upniveshon main aayaat kii jane vaali chaay par teen pence townshed shulk ko jari rakhaa gaya
 Some Members of Parliament wanted to abolish this tax, arguing that there was no reason to provoke another colonial dispute
 udahaaran ke liye rajkosh ke purv chancelar wiliam diadswell ne lord north ko chetavanee di thi ki townshend shulk ko banaaye rakhane par america chaay ko sweekaar nahin karenge
 But North Townshend did not want to give up the revenue derived from the tax, as it was mainly used to pay the salaries of colonial officials; The right to tax Americans was also another concern
 itihaaskaar benzamin labaari ke anusaar, "ziddee lord north ne anjaane main pracheen british samrajya ke taabut main ek keel thok di thi
 " townshend shulk ke prabhavi hone ke baavjood, chaay adhinium east india company ko pehle se adhik sasti chaay bechney kii anumati detaa tha, jisase iske daam taskaron dwaara prastaavit daamon se kam the
 In 1772, the most common variety of legally imported tea sold at Bohia 3 shillings per pound
 After the Tea Act, colonial traders could sell it for up to 2 shillings per pound, slightly less than the smugglers' 2 shillings and 1 penny price
 yah samajhate hue ki townshend shulk kaa bhugtan rajnatik taur par samvedansheel tha, company kuch is prakaar kii vyavastha kar ke kar bachaana chaahati thi ki ek baar upniveshon main utarane par yaa to ek baar main hi landan main iskaa bhugtan kar diya jaae, athwa chaay bechney ke baad vyapaaree chupchaap shulk kaa bhugtan karen
 An attempt to hide this tax from the colonists was unsuccessful
 sitambar or oktober 1773 main, chaay se laden hue east india company ke saat jahaaz upniveshon main bheje gayi: chaar boston kii taraf tathaa neuyork, philadelphia or charlston main prayek ke liye ek
 jahaajon main 2000 se adhik petiyon main lagbhag 6 xxrep 5 0 pound chaay bhari hui thi
 While the ships were en route, the Americans came to know the details of the Tea Act and protests escalated
 vigs jo kai baar khud ko san of liberty kehete the, ne jaagrukta badhaane ke liye ek abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii or vyapaariyon ko istife ke liye aashwast yaa majaboor kiya, usee dhang se jis dhang se 1765 main stamp adhinium sankat ke dauraan stamp vikritaon ko kiya gaya tha
 The protest movement that ended with the Boston Tea Party was not about disputes arising from higher taxes
 vastav main vaid rup se aayaat kii jane vaali chaay kii keemat 1773 main chaay adhinium dwaara kam kar di gayi thi
 The protesters were concerned over other issues rather than this
 parichit ukti "pratinidhitiv ke bina koi kar nahin" ke saath upniveshon par sansad ke adhikaron kaa varchasv pramukh mudde the
 Some described the purpose of the tax program — to free the chief officers from colonial influence — which was a dangerous violation of colonial rights
 yah visheshkar masachusets ke liye sach tha kyonki yahi akelaa upnivesh tha jahaan townshend kaarykram puri tarah se lagu kiya gaya tha
 Colonial traders, some of whom were smugglers, played an important role in the protests
 As the Tea Act legitimately made imported tea cheaper, it posed a threat to Dutch tea smugglers going out of business
 vaid chaay ayatak, jinhen east india company dwaara vyapaaree kaa darza nahin diya gaya tha, bhi chaay adhinium ke kaaran aarthik sankat kii sthiti main the
 Another cause for concern for traders was that the Tea Act led to the monopoly of the East India Company on tea trade and it was feared that other items would be included in the future monopoly policy to be made by the government

 However, in Boston, Governor Hutchison stood firm with his determination

 When the tea-laden ship Dartmouth reached Boston Harbor at the end of November, the Whig leader Samuel Adams held a large mass meeting at Fenuil Hall on 29 November 1773
 hajaaron log pahunche, itane adhik ki baithak adhik bade old south meeting house main sthanantarit kar di gai
 According to British rules, Dartmouth had to unload the goods and pay the duty within twenty days or else the customs officers could seize the goods

 Meanwhile, 25 people were appointed at the meeting to oversee the ship and prevent the landing of tea boxes — many of which were from Davison, Newman & Company in London

 Eleanor and The Beaver, two tea-laden ships, arrived at Boston Harbor, 16 December — the deadline for Dartmouth deadline — about 7,000 people gathered at the Old South Meeting House
 After learning that Governor Hutchison has refused to leave the ships, Adams declared that "this meeting can do nothing more to save this country
" According to a popular legend, Adams' statement was a planned gesture to start a "tea party"
 haalanki, is daawey kii tab tak pushti nahin ho saki jab tak ki ghatana kii ek sadi bitne ke pashchaat adams ke padpote dwaara likhi gayi jeevani nahin dekhi gayi, jisane ki nishchit taur par ghatana kii galat vyakhya kii he

 In Britain, politicians who were considered friendly of the colonies were also amazed and this act united all the parties there against the colonies

 The joining of two pieces of steel or iron by heating them with a lot of white heat is called crushed welden or chopping
 prayek dhaatu ko khub tapaane se vah thos se drav rup main badalane lagati he lekin pitwaan loha athwa mulaayam ispaat main ekadam aisa nahin hota
 They become very soft and sticky when heated by glowing white, in which case if the two pieces are joined together with pressure by joining them together, they are joined together
 yah taap 815 degree se 870 degree sein
 tak hota he
 By heating it to a low temperature, try to add as many beaten pieces, they will never join and heating them to a temperature higher than the above temperature will make their metal burning useless
 pitwaan loh ko adhik garam karne se usamen se baarik safed chinagaariyaan swat: hi nikalne lagati hai
 Mulched weldable heat in soft steel is slightly inferior and comes when its red color changes to white

 Their figure is shown in a, b and c respectively
 yah jod vastu kii lambaai kii disha se samakon par banaaya jaataa he
 In frosty condition, making the right joint, then heating the welded objects white and pressing them together, and it is often seen that the heated floor does not meet each other at all due to full pressure due to hand pressing
 Due to the joint being broken, it breaks later, so in good factories, by pressing the objects in a particular type of machine, they hit it by placing it on the anvil that is attached to the machine
 is jod ko banane ke liye thandhi haalat main kisi prakaar kii taiyaari nahin kerani padati
 But this joint remains thick as shown in figure h of Fig
 2
 and where the thick edge of one piece penetrates into the other, there is a crack, so before the joint is made, beat and beat it with the part of each piece Is considerably diluted, as shown in Fig
 2 b and i
 in jodon ko banane kii taiyaari main khaas baat yah he ki un donon takkaron kii akruti aisi banaai jaae ki ine tej garam hone kii haalat main unpar bananevaala slag sampark ke kaaran dabate hi swat: baahar kii taraf aasaani se nikal jaae, at: donon siron kaa thodaa-thodaa thaans kar unhen kuch unnatodar akruti de di jaati he
 Special type of parts are also used to make such a shape, the type of parts which are also used, the type of heads shown in figure f of Fig
 2
 are absolutely wrong, because the joint In the middle, where the collisions meet, a cavity will be formed, from which the slag will not come out, so the edge will be connected first when mixing the two collisions, consequently the joint will be weak

 While making the curved part of the second piece, it should not be made smooth and should be made rough by making a stair-like tooth

 In Fig

 hydrogen chloride ke nirmaan main parsilan yaa kaanch ke paatr suvidhajanak hote hai kyonki saamaanya dhaatuen is amla se aakraant ho jaati hai
 But now some metals or alloys have been found, such as tantalum, hystealy, durichlor whose characters may be used because they are highly resistant to acids

 Comets with short paths complete the orbit of the Sun in an elliptical path in about 6 to 200 years
 kuch dhoomaketu kaa path valayakaar hota he or wo maatr ek baar hi dikhaai dete he
 Comets with long paths take thousands of years to orbit one
 adhiktar dhoomaketu barf, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia tathaa anya padaarth jaise silicket or carbonic mishran ke bane hote he

 When the comet comes closer to the Sun, the umbilical gases evaporate due to the effect of solar radiation
 isse coma kaa aakaar badhkar karodon mile tak ho jaataa he

 As the comet approaches the Sun, the tail size increases
 dhoomaketu ke bhautik gun neeche sarini main diya gaya he - The comet is classified on the basis of its orbit
 The orbits of comets with short orbits are smaller than 200 years, while the orbits of long-sighted comets are under the Sun's gravity, despite being very long
 Due to the solo orbiting orbit of parabola, such comets once circled the sun and went out of the solar system forever
 The orbit of the Anke Comet with smaller orbit lies between the Sun and the Guru
 It is believed that smokers with short orbit originate in the Kuiper belt, while long-haul axes originate in the Oort cloud
 It is believed that comets hold a long orbit when the Sun passes near a star orbiting the galaxy, or when the Sun's possible companion star, Nemesis or Planet X, comes close to it

 Sometimes it happens that after thorough study of the newly discovered comets, they are identified as missing comets
 11P / Temple - Swift - Linear Comet is an example of this
 He was first seen in 1869, after 1908 Jupiter's influence changed its orbit and it disappeared somewhere in space
 He was rediscovered in 2001 by a scientist named Linear
