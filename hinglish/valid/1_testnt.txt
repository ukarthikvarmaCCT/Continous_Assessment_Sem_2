 Hanzhi or Chinese charts are expressions used to write Chinese language and Japanese language
 inhen chini ke liye jab prayog kiya jaae to yah haanazi kehalaate hai or jab japani ke liye prayog kiya jaae to kanji kehalaate hai
 In ancient times they were also used for Korean language and Vietnamese language
 chini bhavchitra duniya kii sab se puraani chalati aa rahi likhane kii vidhi he
 Although there are tens of thousands of images in Chinese, but most of these are only seen in historical writings
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki saadhaaran chini main sakshar hone ke liye teen se chaar hazaar bhavchitron kaa jaananaa kaafii he
 Every Chinese phrase has an accent and a meaning attached to it, and most Chinese words are written with two expressions
 yah dhyaan rahe ki uccharan upbhasha or bhashaa ke saath badalata he
 It is not like the Devanagari script that a letter has the same pronunciation everywhere
 ise samajhane ke liye sochiye ki agar koi pahaad kaa chitra dekhe to vah sabko samaj aa jayega, lekin hindi bolne vaala us shabd ko 'parvat' kahegaa, farsi bolne vaala 'koh' kahegaa or angrezi bolne vaala 'mountain' kahegaa
 Chinese expressions often have two or three forms: samay ke saath-saath bahut saare bhavchitra prachlit ho chuke the or unamem se bahut likhane main bade pechide the, isliye japan or china kii sarkaron ne inamen kuch maanakeekaran or sarleekaran kiye hai
 With this, many words in the Chinese language have two forms - the traditional Chinese form and the simplified Chinese form
 bahut se shabdon ke japani or chini rup bhi milte-julate lekin zaraa bhinn hote hai
 There are several categories of Chinese charts: yah kabhi chitra hua karte the lekin likhaai main aasaani laane ke liye or maanakeekaran karne ke baad inaki shaklein thodi badal gai hai
 For example, व्यक्ति means 'person', 日 ie 'sun', 月 means 'moon' and 木 means 'tree'
 lagbhag 4% chini bhavchitra is shrenee ke hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'pictogram'
 yah chitron main thodaa pher-badal kar ke unhen anya matlab dete hai
 For example, where 木 means 'tree', जोड़कर is formed by joining two trees, which means 'clump'
 agar teen vriksh jodakar 森 likhe, to iskaa arth 'jangal' hota he
 In the same way चाकू means 'knife' but by marking its edge, 刃 is made, ie 'edge'
 zaraa-zaraa se nishaan banane se nae arthon vaale shabd banaae gaye hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'idiogram'
 inamen ek se adhik chitron yaa bhavchitron ko jodakar nae arthon vaale shabd banaae jate hai
 For example, combining 'sun' and 'i
e
' moon 'makes' light'
 yadi vyakti ko ped se joda jaae to 休 banataa he, jiskaa matlab he 'vishram' 
 Similarly, adding 女 and 子 makes 好, meaning 'good' is determined
 haalanki isapar kuch bhashavaigyanikon kaa vivaad he, isaki ek anya misaal 'chat' ke liye 宀 chihn ko 'stri' ke liye 女 chihn ke saath milakar 安 bananaa he, jiskaa arth 'shaanti' he 
 Even in modern times, such new expressions have been fabricated according to need
 platinum ek moolyawaan safed dhaatu hoti he, jiske liye bhavchitra 鉑 he, jo 'safed' or 'dhaatu' ko milakar bana he
 In the same way, combining 'meter' and 'thousand' was made - it started being used around the end of the nineteenth century
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'idiogramic compoundj' kehete hai
 Sometimes it has happened that there was no sign for anything but if the word was pronounced by another word for which the image was, then that mark was used for both
 masalan, bahut chini bhashaaon main 'zee' shabd kaa arth 'naak' bhi tha or 'swayan' bhi tha
 The symbol for 'nose' was और and it also came to be used for 'self'
 vaqt ke saath is chihn kaa 'naak' arth to bhula diya gaya or aadhunik chini lipi main iskaa arth sirf 'swayan' rah gaya he
 The name of this category is derived from 'rebus' English
 chini lipi ke sab se adhik shabd is shrenee ke hote hai
 They contain one or more signs that describe the meaning of the word and a graphic that has nothing to do with the meaning but is a sign of something that is similar to the word
 is se shabd kaa uccharan or matlab donon pataa chal jate hai
 For example, 'river', 'lake', 'waterfall', 'very strong water stream, or flushed water' and 'slippery'
 gaur kijiye kii har chihn kii bai taraf teen choti lakeeren hai, jo 'nadi' ke chitra ko saral karke bana he
 This indicates that the word is related to 'water'
 shabd kaa dai taraf kaa hissaa sirf dhwani bataata he
 On the right side of 中 is,, which means 'beech' in Chinese and is pronounced 'zhong'
 dekha ja saktaa he ki 沖 kah rahaa he 'pani se sambandhit shabd, jiskaa uccharan jhong se miltaa he', yani 'chong'
 In English, the meaning that describes such expressions is called 'radical' and the words in this category are called 'phono-semantic Compounds'
 is shrenee ke bhavchitra sabase pehle shang rajvansh ke jamaane main viksit hue the or us samay ke khandhiron main mili haddiyon par kharonche hue mili hai
 Sometimes a word is formed from two expressions in which the meaning is applied to both images
 masalan china kaa ek sangeet vaadya he, 'biva' or ek fal he 'laukaat'
 Both of these shapes are seen
 biva ko 批把 likhaa jaataa tha, jisamen donon chihnon kii bai taraf ek upar-neeche jate haath kaa arth sanket he, yani upar-neeche haath chalaakar vaadya bajaanaa
 Now by changing the meaning of 'hand' in it, applying the radical of 'tree' became the symbol of इसमें
 is nae do chihnon vaale shabd kaa matlab 'laukaat kaa fal' tha
 The symbols of the Biwa instrument itself changed over time and are 琵琶 in modern Chinese
 bhashaaon main sajaateey shabd ve hote hai jo kabhi ek hi hua karte the lekin samay ke saath-saath inke swar alag ho gaye hai or kabhi-kabhi arth bhi badal gaye hai
 For example, the word 'husband' in Sanskrit and the word 'potent' in English originate from the same primitive indo-european language word, but over time both their pronunciation and meaning have varied
 chini bhashaa main bhi aisa hua he
 For example, 'cao' and 'lao' were once the same word, but over time, both their pronunciation and expressions have differed
 is shrenee ke bhavchitra chini lipi main kam hai or angrezi main is shrenee ko 'transformd cognats' bulaayaa jaataa he

png surabhedi bhashaa aisi bhashaa ko kaha jaataa he jisamen awaz ke sur ke badlaav ke aadhaar par shabdon or vaakyon kaa arth badal jaataa ho
 The Chinese language is the Surabhedi language spoken by most of the people of the world
 bharat main punjabi or dogri jaisi pashchimi pahari bhashaayen surabhedi hoti hai
 To some extent, emotions are communicated through notes in every language, but the meaning of words with the same characters varies only with the letters in the Surabhedi languages
 angreji main surabhedi bhashaaon ko "tonal langvejiz" kehete hai
 The meaning of the word "ma" in Chinese depends on the change of tone - agar suron ke badlaav ko tiron se dikhaaya jaae, to chini kii ek pankti is prakaar ho sakati he - If one is not accustomed to piercing languages, he will only have the impression of "mama Ma Ma De Ma Ma" in this line
 use lagegaa ke ek hi "maa" shabd baar-baar doharaaya ja rahaa he jabaki alag-alag suron kii vajah se vastav main yahan paanch alag shabd kahe ja rahe hai
 Similarly, in Punjabi, the notes are used - dhyaan rahe ke inhen punjabi kii donon lipiyon main alag-alag likhaa jaataa he, lekin inkaa uccharan ek-sa hota he
 Punjabi can be asked "whip, whip?" - If their notes are spoken properly, it means "horse, whip, or bitter" to Punjabi mothers
 It will be understood when it is possible that non-punjabis have been told that the same word has been said three times

 Migration of birds or migration of birds is a very important part of ornithology
 unka yah pravrajan, rituparivartan ke samaan niyamit or kramik hota he or yug-yug se yah manushyon main utsukata or jigyaasa utpann karata rahaa he, yahan tak ki red indianon ne apane kalendar ke maheenon ke naam pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon ke aagaman par hi rakhaa he
 Landborough Tomson, a recognized scholar of the subject of bird migration, has described the migration as follows: bahut purv aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jis prakaar kuch stanpayi or urag sharad ritu main thand se bachane ke liye sheetanishkriyata main chale jate hai, usee bhanti ababil, kalvinkak or koyal bhi shitashayan karti hai
 Such a belief had been prevalent since Aristotle's time
 ushnraktata, pankh or udaan kii adbhut shakti ke kaaran chidiyon main sthanparivartan karne kii kshamta kaa vikaas bahut adhik hua he
 Although birds are more tolerant of both extreme cold or extreme heat than other animals, they are forced to migrate when there is a lack of food in the autumn, otherwise they may die
 pravrajan ke dwaara chidiyon ko do pratikul rituon main bhi do anukool kshetra praapt ho jate hai
 In one region they live and breed and in another region go for food and rest
 yah prakruti kaa vidhaan he ki chidiya pravrajan kshetra ke thande bhaag main hi andey detii hai
 Hence their mating area in the Northern Hemisphere is the Arctic North Pole or temperate zone, but in contrast to the Southern Hemisphere, winter habitat is near the equator
 praaia: pravrajan uttar se dakshin kii ore hota he, yadhyapi kuch pravrajan purv se pashchim kii ore bhi hota he
 Migration ranges from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers, as some birds descend from the higher elevations of the Himalayas to the plains of northern India and some thousands of kilometers to the south
 sabase adhik dur kaa pravrajan uttar dhruviya kurri karti he
 This migration occurs twice every year
 yah arctic ke sheetkaal main dakshin kii ore deshaagaman karti he, sansar ko paar kar dakshin dhruv antarctic main greeshm ritu bitaakar pun: waapas hoti he
 In this way, the journey of one way to and from the journey covers a distance of about 17,742 km
 chidiyon main pravrajan kaa aarambh hone ke sambandh main anek siddhant pratipadit hai
 Sparrows have the following benefits from migration: chidiyon kaa pravrajan pakshi kii ant: or bahya donon hi uttejnaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Experiments reveal that the change in the time period of the external stimuli is prominent; The internal stimulation is produced by hormones produced by the genitals
 pravrajan kaa lakshyasthaan kaise nirdhaarit hota he or chidiyaan is gantavy sthaan kaa rasta kaise maaloom karti hai, inkaa anek prayogon or prekshanon se par bhi abhi tak santoshjanak uttar nahin mil sakaa he
 In the spring, after the autumn, the first return of adult males occurs in the breeding area or summer-dwelling area
 iske baad vayask maadaaen or ant main avyask chidiyaan pahunchati hai
 But in the autumn this sequence is reversed
 pratham avyask pakshi or maadaaen dakshini yatra ke liye prasthaan karti hai or baad main vayask nar
 The journey to the south takes a lot of leisure and stops from place to place
 chote bachche athwa kishor, jinaki umr kuch hi maheenon kii hoti he, kafile kaa pathpradarshan karte hai or vayask baad main unka anusaran karte hai
 How does this happen? There have been many interpretations of this
 unamem se adhik sweekrut mat yah he ki anek pidiyon ke prati varsh pravrajan ke kaaran pakshiyon main anya janmajaat gunon, jaise thik samay par, bina kisi purv anubhav ke, jatiparampara ke anusaar ek vishesh prakaar kaa need nirmaan karnaa he, usee bhanti bina kisi purv anubhav ke pravrajan bhi ek janmajaat gun ho gaya he
 How do birds find the way to remote territories? There are many hypotheses about this, some of which are subtle sensitivity to the magnetism of the Earth, identification by sight of landmarks etc
 kintu purvanubhavvihin kal kii chidiyon main dur gantavy sthaan or uske path ko nirdhaaran ab bhi rahasyamay bana hua he
 Just as a man travels to the faraway and then returns to his home, just as the birds travel thousands of kilometers and spend the autumn in a remote place, not only reach their summer-residence area, but also They also reach the nest
 chidiyon ko challa pehanaane kii vidhi se yah sthapit ho gaya he ki europe main ababil praaia: na keval usee basti main pahunch jaati he, balki usee ghar main jisko chhodkar vah sudur kii yatra par gai thi, pahunch jaati he
 The abbeel covers a distance of 9,677 kilometers in this journey
 yaheen baat anya vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Some known facts published as a result of many years of inspection reveal that the birds not only reach their habitat and old nid, but also return on the exact day they returned in the previous year
 atev jab itani lambii yatra karti hon to ek nishchit samay par lautakar pakshiyon kaa apane ghonsle main upasthit ho janaa or bhi ascharyajanak he
 The position of each autumn bird in the winter in different regions of India varies
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi sthaan ko le len, jaise madhya bharat kaa bhopal kshetra
 Most species of birds, which travel from north or northwest frontier regions in the autumn, to the far south or to Lanka, through that country, go through Bhopal
 in yatriyon main se kuch to peeche rah jate hai or ve sharad ritu bhar bhopal main dekhen ja sakate hai
 We can classify these under the actual autumn, but some remain only for a short time upon the arrival of autumn and do not appear thereafter as they have departed from there to travel further
 ve pun: greeshm ritu ke prarambh main, jab ve uttar kii taraf lautate hote hai, dikhaai padate hai
 They are migrating travelers in autumn and spring
 kuch to sharad ritu main, jab dakshin kii yatra par hote hai, tab to dikhaai padate hai, kintu jab ve vasant main pun: apane nivas kii ore lautate hote hai, tab dikhaai nahin padate, kyonki ve kisi duusare maarg se hokar laut jate hai
 Hence those birds appear in Bhopal in autumn and in spring in some other part
 kuch chidiyaan desh ke andar hi ek bhaag se duusare bhaag main sthanparivartan karti hai, jaise shah bulbul yaa dudhnju, sunaharaa polak or naurang 
 This local migration occurs more in the northern part of the country or in the foothills of the mountains, where seasonal changes are more effective than in the equator
 vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon kii bhanti inamen bhi pravrajan kramik or niyamit hota he
 In some parts of the country, some caste arrive in summer, some caste in rain and some caste in autumn
 iske atirikt ek anya prakaar kaa bhi sthanparivartan baraabar hota rahata he, jo aahaar par prabhaav daalanevaali sthaneey paristhitiyon, jaise garmi, sookhaa yaa baadh ityadi, athwa kisi vishesh prakaar ke phool lagane or fal pakane kii ritu, ke kaaran hota he
 At that time sparrows move from one area to another
 kabhi-kabhi asaadhaaran paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar apane upyukt nivasasthaan kii chhodkar bhojan kii talash main chidiyaan kisi anya kshetron main bhi bhraman karti hui pai jaati hai
 Therefore, the population of birds is not constant in any area at any given time, because the arrival and regularization of birds in all the areas is always happening
 himalay ke unche pahaado main rahanevaali chidiyaan jaade main neeche utar aati he or is prakaar tufaani mausam or himrekha se neeche chali aati he
 On the arrival of spring, when the ice begins to thaw and the ice line rises upward, they climb again into the upper reaches of the mountains to lay eggs
 yah kram keval oonchaai main rahanevaale pakshiyon main hi nahin varan neeche rahanevaali chidiyon main bhi chalata rahata he
 In addition to gaining scientific knowledge of sparrows migration, light and inscribed rings of aluminum are worn in the majority of sparrows' feet in Britain and the United States
 yah vidhi america main pakshivalayan athwa pakshipatbandhan kehalaati he
 In addition to the serial number, the address of the place is also mentioned
 chidiyon ko anguthi pahanaakar unka purna vivaran ek pustika main likh kar unhen chhod diya jaataa he
 Now on reaching remote places of these sparrows, their ring is taken off by hitting or trapping them and they are sent to the address from where they flew
 jab kaaphi sankhya main is prakaar kii talika ikatthi ho jaati he tab in talikaon kaa vishleshan karke uske aadhaar par kisi vishesh jati kii chidiya ke pravrajan ke maarg athwa anya kisi samasya kaa hal nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, it has been established with certainty and doubtless as a result of the white buck's burrowing in West Germany and the eastern region that the birds of East Asia travel through the southeastern route to Africa, while the white buck of West Germany The South Western route leads to Africa via Spain
 bikaner main isi prakaar kii anguthidhari chidiyon ke praapt hone se hamen pataa chalaa he ki kuch shwet bak jo hamaare desh main, sharad ritu main, aate hai, ve germany ke hote hai
 In India, this type of advocacy has done very little
 kintu jitna kuch hua he usase praapt suchnaayen bahut hi mahatvapurn or upyogi siddh hui hai
 The speed of migrating birds is different in different birds and this speed depends on many things like wind direction, weather etc
 batakhon or hanson main udaan kii gati 64 se 80 kilometre prati ghante pai gai he or anukool mausam main yah gati 90 se 97 kilometre yaa isse adhik pai gai he
 This speed is 9
5 to 17
7 kilometers per hour in birds flying continuously during the day and night
 nimnlikhit sarini se yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki ek baar kii udaan main koun chidiya kitni duuri tay karti he : The Eastern Golden Titibh flies continuously without stopping anywhere and crosses the open sea of 3226
00 km
 yah tittibh sharad ritu main, bharat main bhraman karne aate hai
 It lays eggs in western Alaska and northeastern Sibiria and regularly tours the Hawaiian Islands
 chaha jisaki maadaa keval japan main andey detii he, jaada purvi austrailia or tezmania main vyateet karata he, is prakaar avashya hi 4839
00 kilometre kii duuri bina kahi ruke nirantar udakar paar kar jaataa he
 There are other such birds, which go a long distance without any grain of water
 adhik dur kii yatra karanevaali bhartiya chidiyon main sambhavat: main bhandu teetar he jiskaa andey dene kaa sabase nikatavarti sthaan himalay main hai
 Some pheasants spend part of winter in Nilgiri or other hills in the south and others are not found anywhere
 isse itnaa spasht he ki ye ek udaan main kam se kam 2419
5 kilometre kii duuri avashya hi paar karte hai
 Earlier it was believed that migrating birds fly at very high altitudes, because they have the advantage of determining location, decreasing air flow, etc
 kintu ab yah paaya gaya he ki yadi kisi unchi parvatamala ko paar karnaa nahin hua to vastut: ye pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan 396
24 meter kii oonchaai par udati hai or birli hi chidiya 914
4 meter kii oonchaai tak kii jaati he
 When the sea has to be crossed or there is no barrier of any kind of tree or mountain, then some birds naturally fly even lower than this
 haan, yadi aavashyaktaa hui to chidiyaan bahut kii adhik oonchaai se bhi ud sakati hai
 There is a mention of flying at altitudes ranging from 3
048 meters to 8229
6000 meters
 kapoorkachari zinjibresi kul kii ek kshup jati he jiskaa vanaspatik naam hedichium spiketum he
 It is produced automatically in the subtropical Himalayas, Nepal and Kumaon up to an altitude of five to seven thousand feet
 iske patr saadhaarant: lagbhag ek foot lambey, ytaakar athwa ytaakar-bhaalaakaar, chikne or cond par do panktiyon main paae jate hai
 On the top of the scandal, sometimes up to one foot long dense wreath is formed, in which the flower is covered with white and white letters
 iske neeche bhumishayi, lanbaa or gaanthdaar prakand hota he jiske gol, chapate kate hue or shushk tukade bazaar main milte hai
 It does not have glandular origins like kachur and the smell is more intense
 aisa maaloom hota he ki pracheen ayurvedacharyo ne jis shati yaa shathi naamak aushadravya kaa samhitaon main prachur upyog batalaaya he, vah yahi himodbhava kapoorkachari he
 But due to its inauspiciousness, many other substances of the same clan, which grow in the plains and which may be equivalent to the Sthi in virtue, have probably been taken as representative in its place
 inamen kachur, chandramul tathaa vanaharidra mukhya hai
 That is why the names of all these liquids are often found in the names of Kachur, Sathi, and Kaparkachari, which cause confusion

 Tukojirao Holkar was the commander of the first Ahilyabai Holkar and became the ruler of the Holkar dynasty after his death
 doordarshita ke abhaav tathaa prabal mahatvakankshavash isane mahadji shinde se yuddh mol liya tha tathaa antat purnroopen parajeet hua tha
 From the time of Bajirao I, 'shinde' and 'holkar' were the two major pillars of the Maratha Empire
 ranoji scindia evam malharav holkar shivaji maharaj ke sarvapramukh saradaaron main se the, lekin in donon pariwaron kaa bhavishya saamaanya sthiti vaala nahin rah paaya
 All the successors of Ranoji Shinde were well qualified while the family situation of Malharrao Holkar became unfortunate
 unke putr khanderao ke durbhagyapurna ant ke pashchaat ahilyabai holkar ke stri tathaa bhakthibhaav purna mahila hone se dwaidh shashan sthapit ho gaya
 The capital had Ahilyabai Holkar as the nominal ruler and appointed Tukoji Holkar as the chief executive officer for military operations
 kosh par ahilyabai apana kathor niyantran rakhti thi tathaa tukoji holkar kaaryvahak adhikari ke rup main unki ichchhaaon tathaa adeshon ke paalan ke liye abhiyaanon evam anya kaaryon kaa sanchaalan karata tha
 Ahilyabai was more busy in devotion and charity and could not pay special attention to upgrade the army according to the time requirements
 tukoji holkar atyadhik mahatvakankshi parantu aviveki vyakti tha
 Initially he was an ally with Mahadji in Maratha campaigns
 tab tak uski sthiti bhi apekshaakrit sudrudh rahi
 The defeat of the British army between Bargaon and Talegaon by Peshwa Madhavrao Narayana, the surrender of Raghunathrao and Tukoji Holkar with Mahadji in the victory of the Marathas was also a small but satisfactory part
 san 1780 main tukoji mahadji se alag ho gaya
 After that Mahadji achieved great advancement in the political field and Tukoji's place was greatly reduced
 vastutah tukoji main doordarshita kaa abhaav tha
 He was like a puppet in the hands of his subordinates and secretaries
 visheshtah uske sachiv naroshankar kaa us par anargal prabhaav tha
 For these reasons, despite being the chief caretaker of Ahilyabai, Ahilyabai herself did not trust him much
 lalsot ke sangharsh ke baad 1787 main mahadji dwaara sahaayta bheje jane ke anurodh par naanaa fadanvis ne pune se ali bahadur tathaa tukoji holkar ko bheja tha; parantu ek to in donon ne pahunchne main atyadhik samay lagaaya or phir pahunchakar bhi mahadji se vaimnasy utpann kar liya
 Tukoji was seeking a share in the conquered provinces, and Mahadji naturally said that if he wanted a share, he should also share the money spent for the first victory
 rajput sangh dwaara utpann mahadji ke kashton ko dur karne ke sthaan par tukoji ne unke shatruon kaa paksh liya tathaa mahadji ke prayatnon ko nirbal banane main yogadan diya
 In fact, Tukoji was just an alcoholic soldier
 prashasan ke kaaryon main mukhyatah vah apane shadyantrkaari sachiv naaron ganesh ke haathon kaa khilonaa banakar hi rah gaya tha
 Ahilyabai and Tukoji, who were often equals, could never live with equal opinions
 ahilyabai ne tukoji ko padchyut karne kaa bhi praytn kiya parantu unke parivaar main koi anya vyakti aisa tha bhi nahin jo ki sena kaa niyantran sambhaal saktaa
 Thus, Ahilyabai remained in control of the treasury and Tukoji Holkar faced starvation in military campaigns
 tukoji holkar ke chaar putr the-- kashirao, malharav, vithoji tathaa yashwantrao
 Of these, the first two were sons and the last two were Anuras

 Tukoji was constantly ignoring the orders of the Peshwa and in 1792 he also raised the chiefs against Shinde

 On 8 October 1792, Gopal Rao Bhau, on behalf of Mahadji, made a surprise attack on Holkar at a place called Suravali
 anek sainik maare gaye parantu khud tukoji holkar bandi hone se batch gaya
 Although the agreement was reached with the efforts of Bapuji Holkar and Parashar Pant, Ahilyabai in Indore and Malharrao II, the prodigal son of Tukoji, found it humiliating
 bahari duniya se anbhigya hone ke kaaran ahilyabai ne malharav ke ran main adhikarpurvak jane dene ke uddhat prastaav ko manjuuri de di
 He reached the camp of his father with the army and money he wanted, and in violation of the agreement and consultation of Bapuji and Parashar Pant, started an attack on the scattered horsemen of Mahadji

 This war in Lakeri is believed to have never taken place in North India

 'the rope burned but the cramps didn't go'
 lautate hue usne scindia kii rajdhani ujjain ko nirdayatapurvak lootakar apni pratishodh-bhaavana ko shant kiya
 Tukoji usually remained calm after the said incident
 1795 main nizaam ke viruddh maraathon ke kharda ke yuddh main atyant vriddhavastha main usne bhaag liya tha
 After the demise of Ahilyabai in 1795, Tukoji assumed the title of Indore

 Extended display recognition data is a data structure provided by a digital display to demonstrate its capabilities to a video source
 yahi ek aadhunik personal computer ko yah jaanane kii kshamta pradaan karata he ki usamen kis prakaar kaa monitor joda gaya he
 EDID is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association
 idiaidi main utpaadak kaa naam or serial number, utpaada kaa prakaar, fosfar yaa filter kaa prakaar, disple dwaara samarthit timming, disple kaa aakaar, dipti sambandhi data or pixel masping data shaamil hota he
 EDID structures range from version v1

 displayid ek maanak he, jiskaa lakshya idiaidi or i-idiaidi vistaaranon ko kisi aise ekal praaroop dwaara pratisthapit karnaa he, jo pisi monitor va upabhokta electronics upkarnon ke liye upyukt ho
 The channel for transmitting EDID from the display to the graphics card is usually the I2C bus, which is defined in DDC2B
 didisi or idiaidi ko paribhaashit kiye jane se purv, kisi graphics card ke paas yah jaanane kaa koi maanak tarika nahin tha ki use kis prakaar ke disple upkaran ke saath joda gaya he
 Some VGA connectors on personal computers provided a basic form of identification by connecting one, two or three pins to the ground, but this coding was not standardized
 idiaidi ko aksar serial prom yaa iiprom naamak ek memory upkaran main monitor main sanchit kiya jaataa he or yah adress 0x50 par I2C bas ke madhyam se abhigamya hota he
 The EDID prom can often be read by the host PC, whether the display is automatically turned off or not
 anek software package idiaidi soochna ko pard sakate hai va pradarshit kar sakate hai, jaise microsoft vindos ke liye read-idiaidi or powerstrip tathaa linaks va biesadi unics ke liye eksfri86 hone par idiaidi ko log par output karegaa)
 linaks main, yadi aap "xrandr--verbose" ko kriyanvit karen, to aap aprishkrut idiaidi ko hexadesimal praaroop main bhi dekh sakate hai
 Mac OS x basically reads EDID information and programs such as switchrex or displayconfigx display information as well as use it to define specific resolutions
 anhanced idiaidi bhi usee samay prastut kiya gaya tha, jab i-didisi ko prastut kiya gaya; isane idiaidi sanrachana 1

 i-idiaidi main adhimaanya samyaavadhiyon, shrenee simaaon, monitor ke naam ke liye data fields kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 E-EDID also provides support for dual GTF timescales and aspect ratio changes
 vistaaranon ke prayog ke saath, i-idiaidi string kii lambaai 32 kilobites tak ho sakati he
 Historically, some graphics card drivers with EDID have underperformed, using standard timelines instead of their extended timelines
 yahaan tak ki jin maamalon main ditidi ko padhaa gaya, unamem bhi drivers aksar is maanak samyavadhi nirupak seemaa dwaara simit hai / the ki kshaitij / urdhv vibhedan 8 se purnatah vibhajya hone chahie
 iskaa arth yah he ki anek graphics card chaudee screen vaale adhikansh aam flats panel disple or liquid crystal disple televijan ke mul vibhednon ko vyakt nahin kar sakate
 urdhv pickselon kii sankhya kii gananaa kshaitij vibhedan tathaa chaynit abhimukhataa anupaat ke dwaara kii jaati he
 So to be fully expressable, the size of a wide-screen display must be a multiple of 16x9 pixels
 For a 1366x768-pixel-wide XGA panel, the closest resolution expressable in EDID standard time-varying syntax is 1360x765 pixels, typically found as 3 pixel-thin black columns
 screen kii chaudaai ke rup main 1368 pixel nirdisht karne par 769
5 pixel kii ek aswabhaavik screen oonchai praapt hoti he
 Many wide XGA panels do not advertise their original resolutions in standard timelines, instead only offering a resolution of 1280x768
 kuch panel mul vibhedan se keval kuch hi kam vibhedan ko vigyaapit karte hai, jaise 1360x765
 in panelon dwaara ek pixel sateek chitra pradarshit karne main sakasham ho paane ke liye, disple driver dwaara idiaidi data ko upekshit kiya janaa chaiye athwa driver ko ditidi kii sahi vyakhya kerani chaiye or vah un vibhednon ke nivaaran main sakasham hona chaiye, jo 8 dwaara vibhajya na hon
 idiaidi data se maanak samyavadhi nirupakon kaa adhirohan karne ke liye vishesh program uplabdh hai; microsoft vindos ke liye powerstrip or mike oes eks ke liye swicharesex 
 haalanki yah bhi sadaiv sambhav nahin hota kyonki apni pasand ke anusaar vibhednon ko kriyanvit karne ke liye kuch vikritaon ke graphics drivers ke liye vishisht registry hack kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jiske kaaran screen ke mul vibhedan kaa prayog karnaa bahut kathin ban saktaa he
