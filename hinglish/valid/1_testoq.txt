 Gravity is the tendency of a material to be attracted towards one another
 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 German astronomer Kepler gave three laws by studying the motion of planets
 kepler kaa pratham niyam: -sabhi grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar kakshaon me chakkar lagate hai tathaa surya un kakshaon ke focus par hota he
 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time
 arthath prayek grah kii kshetreey chaal niyat rahati he
 That is, when the planet is away from the Sun, its speed decreases
 tritiy niyam : - prayek grah kaa surya kaa parikraman kaal kaa varg uski deergh vrittakar kaksha kii ardh-deergh aksh kii tritiy ghaat ke samaanupati hota he
 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground
 par jab akaash main samaan takat chaaron ore se lage, to koi kaise gire? arthath akaash main grah niravlamb rahete hai kyonki vividh grahon kii gurutv shaktiyaan santulan banaae rakhti hai

 Mammoth was a giant elephant-like creature that is now extinct
 iskaa vaigyanik naam 'mamuths primigeniyas' he
 It is the name of an elephant buried in snow in Tundra region of Siberia, which is now extinct, but whose entire dead body is still found safe due to snow
 anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki france main yah jantu him yug ke ant tak or siberia main sambhavat: or aage tak jivit rahaa hoga
 The word Mammoth is believed to have originated from the Sibirian word 'mammoth', which means 'animals living under the ground'
 chunki is hathi kaa sharir sadaiv jame hue barfile keechad ke neeche hi paaya gaya he, at: us desh ke kisaan maimath ko ek prakaar kaa vrahat chhachhundar hi samajhate the
 In the caves of France, the pre-medieval hunters have left many pictures of the above-mentioned human elephant, which makes it clear that this animal used to live in Europe before and in the search of food after the end of the ice age and the snow moved
 Moved towards and got trapped in the marshland there due to its heavy body and froze with the swamp
 aakaar main maimath vartmaan haathiyon ke hi baraabar hote the, parantu kai gunon main unase bhinn the
 For example, unlike the current elephants, Mammoth's body was brown and black and in many places covered with long hair to the ground, the skull was short and high, the ears were short and the mammoth teeth were very long
 maimath danta kii ek visheshta yah bhi thi ki ve sarpil the
 Mammoth teeth are safe in such a good condition that they are still used in the industry and during the medieval period they also had good trade between Siberia and China
 sach to yah he ki barf main dabe rahane ke kaaran maimathon, kaa sara sharir hi itani acchhee dasha main surakshit mila he ki na keval inkaa maance khaane yogya paaya gaya varan unke munh or amashay main padaa us samay kaa bhojan bhi abhi tak surakshit mila he

 Yogavasistha is the most important text of Advaita Vedanta in Sanskrit literature
 isamen rishi vasishtha bhagwaan ram ko nirgun brahm kaa gyaan dete hai
 According to Adikavi Valmiki tradition, the author of Yogavasishtha is considered
 mahabharat ke baad sanskrit kaa yah doosraa sabase bada granth he
 It is also an important book of yoga
 'maharamayana', 'yogavasishth-ramayana', 'aarsh ramayana', 'vaasishth-ramayana' tathaa 'gyanavasishth' aadi naamon se bhi ise janaa jaataa he
 The Yogavasistha has a representation of the inclinations of the world and the Paramatmatta through various parables
 yogavasishth ke tritiy prakaran kaa naam utpatti prakaran, chaturth kaa naam sthiti prakaran tathaa pancham kaa naam upsham prakaran he
 On this basis, it seems that this case is an interpretation of the letters A, u and m of Onkar
 vidvatjanon kaa mat he ki sukh or dukh, jaraa or mrityu, jivan or jagat, jad or chetan, lok or paralok, bandhan or moksh, brahm or jeev, aatma or paramatma, atmagyaan or agyaan, sat or asat, man or indriyaan, dharna or vaasana aadi vishyon par kadachit hi koi granth ho jisamen ‘yoga vaasishth’ kii apeksha adhik gambhir chintan tathaa sookshm vishleshan hua ho
 The importance of this book is further enhanced by the combination of countless fascinating stories along with the experiences of many sages and sages
 moksh praapt karne kaa ek hi maarg he aatmanusndhan
 a unique description of the activities of many saints and great men engaged in Atmanusandhan is given in this book
 yogavasishth main jag kii asatta or parmatmasatta kaa vibhinn drushtaanton ke madhyam se pratipaadan he
 Along with the representation of the effort and knowledge of the elements, it also has a subtle discussion on scriptural virtue, renunciation, ritualism and ideal behavior etc
 isamen baudhon ke vigyaanvaadee, shoonyavaadee, madhyamik ityadi maton kaa tathaa kashmiri shaiva, trik, pratybhigna tathaa spand ityadi tatvagyanon kaa nirdesh hone ke kaaran iske rachayita usee naam ke anya kavi maane jate hai
 Hence there is a difference of opinion regarding the actual author of this book
 yah granth arshramayana, maharamayana, vasishtharamayana, gyanavasishth or keval vaasishth ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 The verse number of Yogavasistha is 32 thousand
 vidwaanon ke matanusaar mahabharat ke samaan iskaa bhi teen avasthaaon main vikaas hua— The Yogavasistha text is complete in six episodes
 isamen shlokon kii kul sankhya 27687 he
 Its 'maharamayana' designation is very meaningful due to the fact that there are about four thousand more verses than Valmiki Ramayana
 isamen ramachandraji kii jeevani na hokar maharishi vasishtha dwaara die gaye aadhyatmik upadesh hai

 In this regard, PN Singh rightly writes- "ram Vilas ji lived for a lifetime that Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc
 castes could be formed in India and they could develop into a political entity but in the Hindi territory There was a lack of ethnic perception due to which it remained politically divided

 Due to the widespread cultural influences of concurrent white castes, their ancient culture is undergoing rapid changes
 unhen vinasht hone se bachaane ke liye pichley kuch dashakon main shashan kii ore se vishesh praytn kiye gaye hai
 Many possibilities, fantasies and beliefs have been introduced from time to time regarding the origin of American Indians
 kuch logon kaa anumaan tha ki ve isroyal kii das khoi hui jatiyon ke vanshaj he or kuch log unhen sikandar kii jalsena ke bhatke hue bedon ke navikon kii santan maanate hai
 In relation to this, there was also the belief that they are the offspring of the original inhabitants of the fictional island called "atlantis continent" or "moo" of the Pacific Ocean mentioned in legends
 madhya america kii maaya indian jati or pracheen misr kii sthapatyakala main samta drushtigat hone ke kaaran yah anumaan bhi kiya gaya ki indian misr athwa misr se prabhavit deshon se america aae
 In this context, it is necessary to know that the ancient architecture of Egypt had declined several thousand years before the time when the Mayan Indians started construction of temples
 america main pracheen maanav sambandhi vaigyanik khojein hone ke pehle yah sambhavta bhi thi ki indianon ke purvaj is bhoomi par maanav jati kii ek swatantra shakha ke rup main viksit hue hon, parantu ab yah nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki amareeki mahadwipon par maanav jati kii koi shakha ke vikascram main is bhubhag par keval limar, tarasier or katipay jatiyon ke bandaron ke prastikrut avshesh hi mili hai
 Even after diligently searching the scholars of ancient mankind, near human apes or ancient human beings could not find any remains here
 is tarah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yahan maanav jati kii kisi shakha ke swatantra vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin thi or yahan ke pracheenatam nivaasiyon ke purvaj sansar ke kisi anya bhaag se aakar hi yahan based honge
 Experts believe that humans came to this part from Asia via the Bering Strait
 shaareerik visheshtaon kii drushti se indian asandigdh rup se asia kii mongolaide prajati kii ek shakha maane ja sakate hai
 The ancestors of Indians who came to America via the route from the Ashes to Alaska had certainly developed to the level of modern humans or "homo sapiens"
 ve apane saath apni mul asian samskruti ke anek tatv bhi avashya laae honge
 He was probably familiar with the use of fire and had also learned to manufacture and use the weapons and equipment of the medieval culture
 maarg main jis kathin sheet kaa saamana karte hue ve is bhoomi par aae usase sahaj hi yah anumaan bhi kiya ja saktaa he ki ve kisi na kisi prakaar ke paridhaan se apane sharir ko avashya dhakte honge or sambhavat: asthaayee grih-nirmaan-kala se bhi parichit rahe honge
 It can also be said that they must have developed some primary form of language by that time
 asia se kai hajaar varsho tak alag alag dalon main manavsamooh america kii bhoomi par aate rahe
 For several hundred years, these groups had to come by snow-covered landmarks; But it is possible that later groups may travel partly in boats as well

 In time, the intermingling of these groups became the dominant feature of Mongoloid species among Indians
 ye aadi indian apane apane saath nav-prastar-yug ke pehle kii samskritiyon ke kuch tatv is bhoomi par laae
 While trying to reconstruct their original culture, Kroeber has made a list of the culture elements who probably came to America along with the Adi Indians
 dabaav dwaara yaa ghiskar banaae hue pathar ke aujaar, paalish, kiye hue haddi or sing ke upkaran, aag kaa upyog, jaal or tokare banane kii kala, dhanush or bhaalaa phenkane ke yantra or paaltu kute sambhavat: indianon kii mul samskruti ke mukhya tatv maane ja sakate hai
 Upon coming to America from Asia, the ancestors of Indians either completely separated from their native Asian branch or maintained some kind of relationship with it, there is a difference of opinion among scholars on this subject
 is prakaar ke sambandhon ko banaae rakhane main jo bhautik kathinaaiyaan thim unke aadhaar par sahaj hi yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi in bhubhaagon main sambandh tha bhi to vah apane vistaar or prabhaav main atyant simit rahaa hoga
 Later, the directions of cultural development that these groups adopted were not influenced by the Brahmo cultures
 nav-prastar-yug kii samskruti kaa vikaas in samoohon ne swatantra rup se kiya
 They domesticated new creatures such as alpacas, lamas and turkeys
 saath hi, makka, cocao, menio yaa kasaava, tambaakoo or kai prakaar kii semon aadi vanaspatiyon kii kheti unhone pehle pahal aarambh kii
 It is a matter of surprise that the neo-stone-era Mayan Indians invented many such cultures that were invented in the relatively developed cultures of the copper-bronze Age in Europe and other parts of the world
