 In software engineering, the design pattern is a common reusable solution to a problem typically encountered in software design
 ek dizine pattern ek purna dizine nahin he jise sidhe code main badla ja sake
 This is a description or blueprint of how to diagnose the problem, which can be used in many different situations
 object-unmukh dizine pattern, isamen shaamil antim anuprayog virgon yaa object ko nirdisht kiye bina, aam taur par virgon yaa object ke bich sambandhon or parsparik kriya ko darshaate hai
 Design patterns remain within the sphere of influence of modules and interconnections
 ucch str par, aise vaastukala pattern maujuud hote hai, jinka vistaar apekshaakrit bada hota hai, jo aam taur par ek puri pranali dwaara anusaran kiye jane vaale ek samgr pattern kaa varnan karte hai
 Not all software patterns are design patterns
 For example, the algorithm resolves calculation problems rather than software design problems
 pattern, christopher alexander dwaara ek vaastukala avadharana ke rup main utpann hue
 1987 main, kent back or ward kaningham ne programing par pattern lagu karne ke vichaar ke saath prayog shuru kiya or us varsh OOPSLA sammelan main apane parinaam prastut kiye
 In later years, Beck, Cunningham and others continued to work on it
 dizine pattern: eliments of rieushable object-oriented software pustak ke 1994 main prakashit hone ke baad, dizine pattern ne computer vigyaan main lokapriyata hasil kii
 That same year, the first conference on programming languages was held, and the following year, the Portland Pattern Repository was established to document design patterns
 is shabdaawalee kaa kaaryakshetra vivaad kaa vishay bana hua he
 Notable books of design pattern style include: haalanki dizine pattern kaa vyaavhaarik anuprayog ek tathy he, tathaapi dizine pattern kii avadharana ko niyamanishth karne kaa kaary kai varshon tak atka rahaa
 Design patterns can accelerate the development process by providing proven and tested development criteria
 prabhavi software dizine main un muddon par vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo karyanvayan main baad tak dikhaai nahin de sakate hai
 Reusing design patterns helps prevent some subtle issues that can cause widespread problems, and it improves code readability for code writers and architects who are familiar with the pattern
 lacheelaapan praapt karne ke liye, dizine pattern aam taur par paroksh upaay kaa atirikt str pesh karte hai, jo kuch maamalon main parinami dizine ko jatil or anuprayog pradarshan ko chot pahunchaa sakate hai
 By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew in every application that uses it
 chunki kuch lekhak ise ghatakon dwaara uplabdh karaae gaye anusaar software punahprayog se ek pichde kadam ke rup main dekhte hai, shodhakartaaon ne pattern ko ghatakon main badalane ke liye kaam kiya
 Meyer and Arnot claim two-thirds success rates in converting the most known patterns into components
 aksar log, kuch software dizine takneekon ko kuch samasyaon ke liye kaise lagu karen, bas itnaa hi samajhate hai
 These techniques are difficult to implement for a wide range of problems
 dizine pattern saamaanya samaadhaan pradaan karte hai, jo ek aise praaroop main pralekhith hota he, jise kisi vishisht samasya se bandhe vinirdesan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Design patterns are composed of several classes
 The structure, participant and collaboration sections are particularly interesting
 ye varg ek dizine akruti kii vyakhya karte hai: ek aadya rup micro-architekchar jise developers copy karte hai or dizine pattern dwaara varnit aavarti samasya ke samaadhaan hetu apane vishisht dizine ke liye anukulit karte hai
 a micro-architecture is a set of program components and their relationships
 developers, is aadya rup micro-architekchar ke apane dizinon main pravartan dwaara dizine pattern kaa upyog karte hai, jiskaa matlab he ki unke dizinon main micro-architekchar kii sanrachana or sanghathan, chaynit dizine akruti ke samaan hoga
 Additionally, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well-understood names for software interaction
 aam dizine pattern ko asthai dizine se adhik majboot banaate hue, samay ke saath sudhara ja saktaa he
 Attempts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains, including the use of current design patterns as domain specific design patterns
 udaahranon main shaamil hai prayokta antarfalak dizine pattern, soochna vizualizeshan, "surakshit prayojyata" or web dizine
 Proceedings of the Annual Pattern Languages of Programming Conference include several examples of domain-specific patterns
 dizine pattern ko multah criational pattern, strectural pattern or biheviaral pattern shreniyon main baanta gaya he or unki vyakhya delygation, agrigeshan or kansaltesan kii avadharanaon ke upyog dwaara kii gai he
 For more background on object-oriented design, see Coupling and Cohesion
 For more background on object-oriented programming, see inheritance, interface, and polymorphism
 Another classification has also introduced the notion of architectural design patterns, which can be applied at the architecture level of software such as model-view-controller patterns
 dubhashie ke zarie pratinidhitiv ko vyakaran samet paribhaashit karata he
 Different objects are added to the property to be added
 ek dizine pattern ke liye pralekhan, us sandarbh, jisamen is pattern kaa upyog kiya gaya he, sandarbh ke andar ke force jise pattern sulajhane kaa prayaas karata he or prastaavit samaadhaan kii vyakhya karata he
 There is no single standard format for documenting design patterns
 balki, vibhinn pattern lekhakon dwaara vibhinn prakaar ke praroopon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 However, according to Martin Föller, certain pattern formats have become more popular than other formats and as a result have become a common early stage for new attempts at pattern writing
 aam taur par istemaal kiye jane vaale pralekhan praaroop kaa ek udhaaharan he, erik gamma, richard hem, ralf johnson or jon licides dwaara unki pustak dizine pattern main prayukt praaroop
 isamen nimnlikhit varg hai: In the field of computer science, some criticisms exist about the concept of design patterns
 dizine pattern kaa durupyog, anaavashyak code ko lagu karne main parinat ho saktaa he
 This contradicts the simplicity paradigm of efficient software development
 dinamik programing language ke upyogkartaaon ne kai dizine pattern kii bhashaaon, jaise C++ or Java kii simaaon ke liye varderound ke rup main charchaa kii he
 For example, visitor patterns do not need to be implemented in a language that supports multimethods
 vizitor kaa uddeshy maujuuda virgon main, unhen bina sanshodhit kiye nai sankriyaayein jodna he
 In c ++, a class is declared as a syntactic structure, with a specific and closed set of methods
 multimethds vaali ek bhashaa main, jaise kaaman lisp varg ke liye tareeke, us varg sanrachana se baahar hote hai or vyakti unhen bina badale nae tareeke jod saktaa he
 Similarly, the decorator pattern is equivalent to an implementation of dynamic delegation, as found in Common Lisp, Objective C, Self, and javascript
 peter norwig ne dizine pattern in dinamik programing main dinamik bhashaaon main vibhinn pattern ko karyanvit karne kii ghisi-pity baat kii charchaa karte hai
 Norwig and others have interpreted language properties that encompass or substitute different patterns that the user of c ++ must implement for himself
 kuch lekhakon kaa aarope he ki dizine pattern, ebstrection ke anya roopon se mahatvapurn rup se bhinn nahin hai or programing ke kshetra main maujuuda tathyavishyak varnan ke liye nai shabdaawalee kaa prayog anaavashyak he
 The model-view-controller paradigm has been cited as an example of "patterns", dating back many years to the concept of "design patterns"
 is par kuch or log tark dete hai ki dizine pattern samudaay kaa praathmik yogadan alexander kii pattern bhashaa kaa istemaal pralekhan ke ek rup main karnaa tha; ek abhyaas jise aksar sahitya main nazarandaaj kiya gaya he

 There is no reliable and reliable evidence regarding the origin of Malayalam language or its literature
 phir bhi malayalam sahitya kii pracheenta lagbhag ek hajaar varsh tak kii maani gai hai
 Regarding language, we have only come to the conclusion that this language is not Sanskritic - it is a member of the Dravidian family
 parantu yah abhi tak vivaadaaspad he ki yah tamil se alag hui uski ek shakha he, athwa mul dravid bhashaa se viksit anya dakshini bhashaaon kii tarah apana astitv alag rakhanevaali koi bhashaa he
 That is, the problem is that the relationship between Tamil and Malayalam is between mother-daughter or sister-sister
 anusandhan dwaara is paheli kaa hal dhundne kaa kaary bhashaa-vaigyanikon kaa he or ve hi is gutthi ko sulajhaa sakate hai
 However, there is no doubt that Malayalam literature was flourishing only when Tamil literature had flourished
 sanskrit sahitya kii hi bhanti tamil sahitya ko bhi ham malayalam kii pyaas bujhaanewaali strothasvini kah sakate hai
 From 3100 BCE to 100 BCE, it was a local form of ancient Tamil
 isa purv pratham sadi se isapar sanskrit kaa prabhaav hua
 From the third century to the middle of the fifteenth century, Malayalam is considered medieval

 These include songs of Bhakti, Veeras and Kammaras as well as adult poetry
 is praudh rachanaaon main "ramcharitam" kaa sthaan sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he
 Its language is so close to Tamil that some Tamil scholars consider it to be the composition of Tamil, but today it is undoubtedly proven that Ramcharitam is Malayalam poetry and its author is also a Keralite
 isaki vishaywastu ramayana ke lankacand kii katha he
 It is composed by a poet named Chiraman from Kerala
 anusandhankartaaon kaa yahi mat he ki ramcharitam kaa rachanakaal 13veen shatabdi he
 In the period from the first to the eighth century AD, many famous Tamil compositions were born in the Chera kingdom, which later became Kerala
 "chilappatikaaram" ityadi ucch koti ke kaavyon kaa udhaaharan ham le sakate hai
 But it would be misleading to count Ramcharitam in this category, that is, Tamil compositions composed by Keralites
 ramcharitam kii rachana us kaal main hui thi jab sanskrit kaa prasar kerala main jam chukaa tha or manipravalam naamak mishra bhashaa viksit ho rahi thi
 In Ramcharitam, Sanskrit and similar words are found in abundance in Sanskrit
 parantu dravid aksharon dwaara likhe jane ke kaaran inke roopon main thodaa parivartan aayaa he
 From the seventh century AD onwards, the Aryan dynasty Namputiris had considerable influence in the cultural region of Kerala
 adhiktar anusandhaataaon kaa yahi mat he ki ve bahut pehle hi kerala main aa chuke the
 Due to these influences, a mixed language called Manipravalam developed in Kerala
 10veen or 15veen sadi isvi ke madhya manipraval sahitya kii atyadhik pushti hui
 Through this Manipraval, many Sanskrit poetic forms were transitioned to Malayalam
 champu kavy, sandesh kavy ityadi kaa udhaaharan ham le sakate hai

 Uniyatichritam was written around 1350 AD and its author is Damodar Chakyar

 Unchichirutevi Charitamco is considered contemporary of these
 parantu yah kis kavi kii rachana he, is sambandh main koi jaankaree nahin he
 As is known by their names, their content is a commendation of some famous beauties
 sandesh kaavyon main "ushnnunilisandeshm" or "kohsandeshm" mahatvapurn hai
 It is believed that the creation period of both is 14th century
 inke rachayita kaviyon ke sambandh main kuch pataa nahin he
 Some miniature Maniprawal works were also composed between the 10th and 15th centuries
 inamen se adhiktar kuch vilasavati sundariyon se sambhddha shringaaras kii rachanaayen hai
 These include the descriptions of the heroines Ilaychi, Cheriyachi, Uttarachandraika, Kaunottara, Mallinilava, Marlekha, etc
 "vaishikantram" is a collection of Kuladharma teachings given to a Vaishyaputri; Its creation is probably 11th century
 bhaktipradhan rachanaayen bhi manipraval sahitya main milti hai
 Anantapurvarnam, Srikrishnastavam, Dasavatarcharitam etc
 are examples of these
 "chandrotsavam 15veen sadi ke ek agyatnama kavi kii rachana he
 The theme is the description of the Chandrotsav celebrated by the courtesan called "medinivenilava"
 manipraval sahitya ke prasar ne us bhashaaroop ke vyakaran niyamon evam saahitiyik lakshanon kaa vivaran denevaale ek shaastragranth kii rachana kii prerana di
 The name of this book is "lilatikam"
 yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki "leelatilakam" 14veen sadi main likhaa gaya he
 If on one side Manipraval literature continued to develop, on the other side the poetry book named "pattu" also increased
 jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, is shakha main dharmik evam kheti or anya peshon se sambhddha anek loakgeet hai
 Toram pattu, sarpam pattu, ayyapp, pattu etc
 are related to ethics and religious subjects
 krishippattu, ararupattu, vallappattu ityadi duusare varg main aate hai
 The basic components of these songs are - vocals, rhythm and rhythm
 praudh geet lokgeeton se bhinn hai
 The above mentioned "ramcharitam" is the first notable in this department
 leelatilakam main praudh pattu kavy ke liye di gai paribhaasha isamen thik baithti he
 The words used in the later "niranam" songs are not simply Dravidian letters
 inamen aise sanskrit padon kii bharmaar he jinase yah pataa chalata he ki sanskrit ke aksharon kaa paryaapt prachaar is samay tak ho chukaa tha
 This view has been recognized that the songs of Niranam were written between the late 14th and early 15th centuries
 ramcharitam or niranam geeton ke kaalon main ek yaa dedh shatabdiyon se adhik kaa antar nahin he
 Yet the language difference between the two is highly evident
 isse yah anumaan hota he ki yadhyapi ramcharitam ke samay main manipraval viksit ho chukaa tha tathaapi is kavy main jaan boojhkar keval tamil ke aksharon dwaara likhe jane yogya padaavalee kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 The nine poets are three - Madhav Panikkar, Shankar Panikkar and Ram Panikkar
 madhav panikkar dwaara anudit bhagavadgita ne bhashaa ko gauravanvit kiya--bharat kii pradeshik bhashaaon main rachit geetanuvaadon main yahi sarvapratham or sarvapramukh he
 It has seven hundred verses translated into 328 songs
 gita kaa aashaygambhiry or mahatta kaa anuwaad main leshmaatr bhi lop nahin hua he
 Shankar Panikkar's composition is a song called "bharatmala"
 ram panikkar ne ramayana, bharat or bhagwat kaa sankshipt anuwaad kiya
 It would not be wrong to say that this poet, who empowered Malayalam to stand on his feet, can be considered the father of language - though in the eyes of the historians, Tushtut Eshuttachdan deserves this title; In my view, it would be a pleasure to give the above title to this Ram poet, known as Kannashishna, because he is also eligible for the Acharyapada of Eshootachchan
 uparyukt saare kavy puranakthaon ke punrakhyaan hai
 But the "krishnagatha", invented in the fifteenth century, is not merely a re-narration of the Purana
 isamen bhagwat ke dasham skandh main varnit krishnagatha kaa anvakhyaan is prakaar sabit hua he ki sanskrit mahakavyon kaa rupashilp manjari chand main--jo dravid chhandon ke parinat prakaaron main se ek he--avatarit hua he
 Therefore, Krishnagatha can be considered as the first independent epic of Malayalam
 rituon ke kavi ke naam se prakhyat krishnagathakar ne prakrutivarnanon dwaara nutan saundarya prapanchon kaa saakshaatkaar karaayaa
 The melodious songs, the fine and gentle pedestal, the choreographed imagination - Krishnagatha has become a hypnotic work due to these
 dekhen - tunchattu ramanujan eshuttachhan The most important department of the Pattu branch is "kilippattu"
 tunchatt eshuttachhan ko is vidha kaa sansthaapak maanate hai
 It contains the spoken narrative of "kili" meaning parrot, hence it is called kilippattu
 eshuttachhan kaa kaal 16veen shatabdi kaa purvardh he
 At this time Kerala was experiencing a type of political, social and cultural relaxation
 is ad:patan se kerala kaa abhyutthan karaane ke hetu avatarit divya purush ke rup main hi kerala kii janata aaj bhi eshuttachhan ko maanati he
 He enlightened the public with the address of devotion
 namdev, kabir, chaitanya, surdaas, tulsidas, maanikkavachakar, compar ityadi bhakt kaviyon se bhasvar nabhomandal main kerala kii disha se udit tarak eshuttachhan hai
 Like all of them, Eshutachchan also succeeded in awakening and enlightening the public
 ramayana, bharat or bhagwat, in teenon ke sankshipt anuwaad ke madhyam se eshuttachhan ne samast keralavaasiyon ke hridayon main sidhe pravesh paaya
 Kerala received a new Garima, seriousness, decency and self-reliance
 isi arth main eshuttachhan ko malayalam sahitya kaa pita maanate hai
 They are poets who are equally adorned in huts and palaces
 pattu vibhaag main doosraa bhaktipradhan gaankavy "puntanam" kii "gyanappana" he
 Other hymns of Puntanam are also full of Lalit, Komal and Bhaktisudha
 is vibhaag kii anya ullekhneey rachanaayen kuch loakgeet or "vatakkan pattu" tathaa "tekkan patte" ke naamon se vikhyath kuch aakhyanatmak gaan kavy hai
 As the names are known, these songs are the heroines of North and South Kerala respectively
 uttari geeton kii bhashaa aadhunik malayalam se milti julati he, parantu dakshini geeton main bhashaa kaa tamil se samipya adhik he
 The influence of Tamil in southern songs composed between the 16th and 18th centuries probably indicates close contact with the Tamil territories of South Kerala, not the lack of independent development of the language
 dakshin ke kavi dwibhasha ke vidvan the
 The second phase of Champu poetry under the Manipraval movement is visible again in the 15th century
 yadhyapi is kaal main teen sau se bhi adhik champu kavy rache gaye to bhi inamen punam namputiri kaa ramayana or mashamangalam narayanan namputiri kaa bhashanaishadh ityadi champu hi vishesh dhyaan dene yogya hai
 The period of Poonam should be in the first half of the 15th century or the late 16th century
 naishadhachampookar kaa kaal 16veen shatabdi kaa madhya he
 Although according to the development, Uttara Manipraval should have predominated Malayalam, yet Sanskrit-dominated language has been adopted in these champs
 aisi sthiti paidaa hui ki adhikansh champuon ko samajhane ke liye sanskrit kaa gyaan anivaary ho gaya
 Because of this Maniprawal literature kept away from the general public
 aattakkatha nritykala se sambhddha sahitya vibhaag he
 The name of this color is "kathakali"
 aattakkatha malayalam kii ek vipul sahityashakha he
 Today Kathakali has international honor
 is kalaroop ko yah sthiti pradaan karne main iske aadharbhoot sahitya ne mahaan yogadan diya he
 In the late 17th century the Manveda king of Kozhikot composed a Sanskrit poem called "krishnagiti"
 iske aadhaar par "krishnanattam" naamak nritykala kaa bhi aavirbhaav hua
 It was planned to play the story of Shri Krishna in eight days
 krishnanattam kii dekha dekhi "ramnattam" naamak duusare nritykala-rup kaa bhi avishkaar kiya gaya
 In the basic literature of this art form, the Ramakatha is divided into eight playable segments in the night

 His compositions are four - all based on anecdotes of the Mahabharata

 Nalcharitam is an actor in four nights

 This talented poet inaugurated an Amodha path for attakathas
 uchhrunkhal pad-yojan-style, achumbit kalpanavaibhav or gambhir jivan-darshan-patutaa se yah kavi anugrihit he
 "girijakalyanam" song management is also considered by some scholars as Unnayi Warrier
 isaki rachana kilippattu ke chhandon main anuprasyukt style main hui he
 During the 18th century, there was a great rise: the rise of the Punj - Kunchan Nampyar, a scholar of Tullah literature
 sambhav he, tullal jaise kalaroop pehle bhi rahe hon
 But there is no doubt that this talented poet developed Tullal as a movement
 ek prakaar se tullal ko nrityaatmak ekabhinay kah sakate hai
 Tullal Geet is literature as its basis
 nampyar ne tullal geeton ke kathanak ke rup main puraanon ke upaakhyaan hi liye hai
 Nevertheless, the atmosphere coming in the narratives is not mythical but it matches the contemporary life of Kerala
 nampyar ne puranic itivritton ke madhyam se tatkaaleen jivan kii vaiyaktik or saamaajik viklaataaon par tikhe vyangabaan chalaae hai
 The goal of this sharp edge of his gimmick was to tear the bones of social body
 tullal sahitya main satair vidha kaa atyadhik sampann kavyalok darshneey he
 No one comes before them, neither before, nor after
 yadi parihaas ko safal bananaa he to sookshm, nirmam or vyapak marmbodh apekshit he
 This accomplishment is abundant, being a humorous ideal of nampyar
 unke hasya or marmoktiyon main vidwesh kii jwaala nahin chubhti, varan hardik sahanubhuti or maanav prem kaa chaitanya hi sfurit hota he
 Another important composition of the Pattu branch is the "kuchelavrittam" Vanchappattu of the 18th-century poet Rampuram Warrier
 shuru shuru main malayalam main gadhy sahitya kii khaas pragati nahin hui thi
 In the 10th or 11th century written "bhashakautaliyam" Kutiyattam, the scripture called "aattapakaraam", giving reference to the performance, 14th century "dootavakyam" prose, "brahmavapuranam" prose of the same century, "ambarishcharitam", "devibhagavatam" etc
 prose - in All can be considered as the gift of ancient times for prose literature
 taddeshiy isai dharmprachaarkon ne kuch gadhy granth 16veen, 17veen tathaa 18veen sadiyon main likh hai
 These include "abbreviation Vedartham" "vedatarkam" etc
 "vartmanppustakam" sarvapratham yatrasahitya he
 The period of some time after Kunchan Nampyar is bleak for Malayalam

 Later Swati was the good morning of Tirunal's era

 It was in this period that Malayalam epics were created as imitations of Sanskrit epics
 krishnagatha ke baad manipraval main ek mahakavy--"shrikrishnacharitam"—kii rachana hui 
 This epic will be followed by at least a century until the era of the imitative epics begins
 ashkatt padmanabh kurup kaa "ramchandravilasam", pantalam kerala verma kaa "rugmangadcharitam" or "vijayodaym", ullur kaa "umakeralam", vallattol kaa "chitrayogam", ke si keshav pilla kaa "keshavium", kitunellur kochunni tampuran kaa vanchishvansham" or "pandavodayam", vatakkumkur rajraj verma kaa "raghuveeravijayam" or "raghavabhudaym", kattakkaum cherian mappila kaa "shreeyeshuvijaym", ityadi malayalam ke pramukh mahakavy hai
 They were written between 1902 and 1917
 gadhy-sahitay main upanyaason kaa udai bhi unnisvin sadi main kerala verma yug main hi hua tha
 The first novel is "kudlata" written by Appu Netunayati
 ek do saal main chantu menon ne indulekha kaa prakaashan kiya
 Chant Menon wrote the first part of the novel called "sharda" - and went to heaven before the second part was composed
 indulekha or sharada aaj bhi malayalam ke saamaajik upanyaason kii pratham shrenee main sthit hai
 Chantu Menon's talent is unique among social novelists
 teen aitihaasik upanyaason "martand verma" "dharmaraaja" or "ramraaja bahadur" ke lekhak si ve raaman pilla aitihaasik upanyaas ke kshetra main vishesh prasiddh hai
 The importance of his social "premamritam" is not so much
 aisa prathit hota he ki unke jivan kaa uddeshy hi aitihaasik upanyaason dwaara malayalam kii garima badhaane kaa tha
 Contemporary poets of Kerala Varma had many Rasik poets
 puuntottam nanputiri, venmani pita or putr, kotungllur kunjikkuttan tampuran, kochuriun tampuran ityadi kaviyon ne milakar ek nutan kavyarup ko janm diya
 All of them were ready to use simple language
 is pravriti ko vikaas "pachch malayalam" andolan ke rup main hua
 Kunnikkuttan Tampuran, Kundur Narayan Menon etc
 were proficient in this type of language experiment
 parantu khed he ki "pachch malayalam" andolan samay se pehle hi samaapt ho gaya
 Yet the poetic style and approach adopted by the poets such as Venmani has further influenced their poets
 manipraval kaal kii shringaar pravriti ne inaki kavita main nae rup main pravesh paaya
 Kunikkuttan Tampuran, the poet at the peak of this movement, is not considered to be an epiphany because he has written some poems in pure Malayalam; But the reason for this is that in the period above just two years of his short lifetime, he showed a miracle that cannot be considered masculine
 yah mahaan kavi is chote arse main sampurna mahabharat kaa malayalam main chhandash: or padash: anuwaad karne main safal hue
 This task did not require even three years to complete the work which required three generations of cultivation in Telugu to complete it! a stream of poetry flowed from his mouth, not that he "wrote" poetry
 unki "saras-drut-kavi-kirit-mani" kii oopaadhi unke liye sarvatha sarthak thi
 It was also appropriate to call him "kerala Vyas"
 ab ham malayalam ke svachhndathawadi andolan ke yug main aa jate hai
 V
C Balakrishna Panikkar's "oru Vilapam" etc
 are memorable in this context
 parantu kumaran aashan kaa "veen poou" hi is andolan kii praarambhik rachanaaon main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he
 The Romanticism of Malayalam flourished and flourished in the form of poems of hope
 nalini, lila, chintavishtyaay sita, chandalabhikshuki, prarodanam, duravastha, karunaa ityadi inaki mukhya rachanaayen hai
 The poetic trajectory that Ashaan succeeded in exposing is a philosopher with serious philosophical, indomitable curiosity of life-giving and intense emotion
 aashan hi vah kavi the jinhone shringaar ko saamaanya dharaatal se swargik vishuddhta tak pahunchaaya
 His poetry is complemented by a beautiful imagination of spiritual love
 vallattol kii safalataa isamen thi ki ve maanav ke maansik bhav ko kaalpaniktaa kaa paridhaan dekar sudar rup main prastut kar sake
 He translated the Balmiki Ramayana in 1909
 1910 main "badhirvilapam" naamak vilaapkavy likhaa
 After that he wrote many dramatic expressions - Ganapathi, Bandhanasthanaay Anirudhan, Oru Kattu, Shishyunum Makanum, Magdalan Mari Yama, Achhukanum Makanum Kochusita etc
 san 1924 ke baad rachit sahityamanjariyon main hi vallattol ke deshbhakti se otprot ve kavyasuman khile the jinhone unako rashtrakavi ke pad par asin kiya
 Enre Gurunathan etc
 are highly popular in those expressions
 jivan ke komal or kaant bhaavon ke saath vicharan karnaa vallattol ko priy tha
 They did not have the tendency to stand and cry in darkness
 yah satya he ki patit pushpon ko dekhakar unhone bhi aahen bhari hai, parantu unpar ansu bahaate rahane kii banisbat viksit sumanon ko dekhakar ahlad prakat karne kii pravriti hi unamem adhik hai
 Ullur, who immortalized his name in poetry by creating an epic called "umakarelam", also composed many clauses and hymns
 pingala, karnbhooshnam, bhakthideepika, chitrashaala ityadi khandakavyon or kiranavali, taraharam tarangini ityadi kavitaasangrahon dwaara unhone malayalam kii shrivriddhi kii he
 But the memory of this great scholar and philanthropist litterateur will probably remain mainly in the hearts of Malayalam lovers as the author of Kerala literature Charitram
 is samay ke anya kuch kaviyon ke naam ye hai - nalppattu narayan menon ; karirppuratt, keshavan nair ; ke ke raja, ityadi
 Poets like g Shankar Kurup, Venikkalum Gopal Kurup, p Kunniraman Nair etc
 were born in the first decade of the 20th century
 itappalli kavidway, valloppilli shridhar menon ityadi inke thode hi saal baad ke hai
 Itappalli poets, especially Champusha, have done away with the world by doing so much work during a period of one and a half decades, but it is incurable by any work even in full Purushayu
 malayalam ke svachhntavaad ke andolan ke liye unki dein amodh he
 G
 Shankar Kurup, Balamani Amma, P
 Kunniraman Nair etc
 have also completed this movement
 pratham gyanpith puraskaar ke vijeta ji shankar kurup ke bhavagiton main 20veen sadi ke bhartiya janajivan main anubhoot pidaaon, vyamohon, mohbhangon, pratikshaon, abhilaashaaon, ichha saakshatkaaron kaa aisa chithran hua he ki ve antaratma kii gaharaaiyon tak pahunch jate hai
 In addition, those songs express the spiritual and mental emotions of humans in symbolic or other forms
 malayalam kii aatmagit shakha ko aaj kii unchaaiyon tak uthaanewaale kaviyon kii shrenee main ji shankar kurup kaa sthaan sarvopari he
 The collection named has received an Academy Award
 ) kunghiraman nair atyadhik prabhaavshaalee kavi hai
 They are only interested in discussing individual cognition circles, and not considering the social relations of the individual
 or tamrattoni prasiddh hai
 Itasheri is a poet adopting a realistic approach
 unki rachanaaon main malayalam kii pehali shrenee kii krantikari kavitaayen aati hai
 Champusha is called the 'gana Gandharva' of Malayalam
 kisi bhi anya kavi ne kavita main itnaa adhik swarmadhurya nahin ghola he
 His dramatic gesture "ramanan" has become a classic
 ramanan kii jitani pratiyaan biki hai utani shaayad eshuttachhan ke aadhyatm ramayana ko chhodkar or kisi rachana nahin biki hongi
 Many of his lines are memorized to every Keralite
 vaigyanik jivan vishleshan, jivan kii anshvarata kaa bodh or maanav jivan kii ore krantikari drushtikon ke kaaran sahitya main valloppilli kaa sthaan mahatvapurn he
 His place of "kutiyosikkal" is unique in Malayalam Revolutionary poetry
 madhyavargeey kavi ke ant:karan kii vednaa kaa itnaa maarmik chithran or koi nahin kar paaya he
 Although ONV Kurup's poetic life began as a revolutionary poet, he is still a romanticist today
 tirunallur karunakaran or punalur balan krantikarikavita ke mantl main anya do vishisht kavi hai- phir unke style vibhinn hai
 Sugatkumari's attitude towards life is philosophical
 vishnu narayanan namputiri, ramakrishnan ityadi udiyaman kavi hai
 P
 Bhaskaran and Vayalar Ramavarma went into the field of film songs after gaining a reputation as revolutionary poets
 en en coccat, madhavan ayyappatt, ayyapp panikkar or en en palur angreji ke naveenatam unmukt kavyavidhaon kaa prayog malayalam main karne main siddhhast hai
 The latest theory in poetics is that the goal of the poem is to attract attention by staring
 uparyukt kaviyon kii kavitaaon main yahi vidha apanaai gai
 Akkittam Achuthan Namputiri Ittasheri and NVV are poets depicting the path paved by Krishna Warrier
 unka kavy "irupatham nurrantinre itihaasam" valloppilli ke kutiyoshikkal kii hi bhanti mahatvapurn hai
 In the absence of any goal, the great ideal of revolution is misleading and the groans of the elitist soul of the wandering modern human are heard in this poem
 malayalam ke upanyaas sahitya, naatak sahitya or kahani sahitya kaa vikaas bhi 20veen sadi main hua
 Simulations dominated the novel branch for a while after Chant Menon and CV Raman Pilla
 appan tampuran dwaara likhit "bhutarair" naamak aitihaasik upanyaas or "bhaskar menon" naamak jasusi upanyaas, tii raaman nampisham kaa keraleshwaran, kedruem panikkar ke "keralasinham" or "parankipatyali" ityadi is jamaane ke mukhya upanyaas hai
 The second era of social novels begins with modern novelists
 muttirindot kaa "appnre makan" yahan vishesh ullekhneey he
 Takshi, Basheer, Keshava Dev, Ponkunnam Varki, Lalitambika Antrajanam, PCC Kuttikrishnan, etc
 were early storytellers
 inamen se takshi, bashir, keshavdev or kuttikkrishnan baad main upanyaaskaaron ke rup main bhi mashhoor hue
 Takshi's "chamin" fame is international
 pi si kuttikrishnan ke upanyaas "ummachchu" or academy dwaara puraskrit "sundariklum sundaranmarum" pratham shrenee ke hai
 Keshavdev's "otayil Ninnu is a famous novel
 inke adhyatan upanyaas "ayalkar" ne academy puraskaar paaya he
 Bashir's "balyakalasakhi", "narupuppakkokaranantarnu" etc
 are high level novels
 takshi kaa rantitreshi", porrekkat kii vishakanyaka nai peedi ke em tii vasudevan nair kaa nalukettu, asuravitu, manju ityadi malayalam ke gine maane upanyaas hai
 Vasudevan Nair is the first local among modern worshipers
 "talm", kattukuramphu "sujatha" seemaa ityadi ke lekhak ke surendran kaa naam ullekhneey he
 The story literature of Malayalam can attain a higher position than any story literature in India
 bashir, antarjanam, worki ityadi kahanikar saamaajik anaacharon or atyaacharon ke viruddh kranti kii aawaaj uthaanewaale lekhak hai
 They succeeded in bringing to light the ethnicities found in their castes
 takshi keshavdev ityadi kahanikaron ne manushya kii saamaajik or aarthik paratantraaon tathaa vyakti kii durbalataaon or parimitiyon ko apni kahaniyon kaa vishay banaaya
 The contribution made by the late A
 Balakrishna Pilla in developing the personality of these storytellers is significant
 mopassaan prabhruti francisi sahityakaron or chekhav prabhruti roosi sahityakaron dwaara prashast kiye gaye margon main hamaare kahanikaron ko le jane kaa shrey inhen baalkrishna pilla ko he
 These inspired the Malayalam storytellers to write stories that enlighten the cultural, social, economic revolution and reveal psychological elements
 aaj kahani ke kshetra main ek aisi peedi agrasar ho rahi he jo in prashast kahanikaron ke padchinhon kaa anusaran kar unase bhi aage badhane kaa praytn kar rahi he
 Saraswati Amma, Rajalakshmi etc
 stand beyond the sphere of these predecessors
 saraswati ammaa beeti hui peedi kaa or swargeey rajalakshmi naveen peedi kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 The name of Madhavikkutty, daughter of Balamani Amma is also notable in the new generation
 nantnar, kovilan ityadi dwaara rachit sainik jivan kii kahaniyaan prasiddh hai
 Parappuram has presented two novels "ninmaniganj Kalpatukal" and "adyikarannal" to this branch and many stories
 puraani peedi ke kahanikaron main teen ullekhneey naam hai--wettur raman nair, karur nilkanth pilla or ponjikkar raaphy
 Nowadays a publishing body called National Book Stall is publishing a collection of selected stories of ten storytellers
 malayalam kaa naatak sahitya sampann he
 Following the era of translation and translation of culture plays, some imitations of prose plays also came
 aadhunik gadhy naatakon ke purvagami ke rup main si raman pilla ityadi ke prahasan, baad main en pi chellakkapan nair aadi hasya naatakakaron ke liye preranastrot bane
 Canikkar Kumar Puppy, Canikkar Padmanabha Puppy etc
 also wrote serious plays
 ibson kii natya vidha ko apanaakar likhe hue samasyamoolak naatakon kii disha main en krishna pilla ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Among the dramas that make up the social problem are VT Bhattatirappat's "attukalayil Ninnu Aranatekku" and in political dramas "patabaki" are notable
 aaj ke naatakakaaron main tii e gopinathan nair, tair, nagavalli aar en kurup, keshavdave, en pi chellappan nair, ke tii mohammad, toppil bhaasi, ji shankar pilla ityadi pramukh hai
 Toppil Bhasi's "ninlenne Communistakki" "mutianay Putran", Surveyakkal etc
 and Muhammad's "karvarar animal" "manan Kara Grihaatilanu" etc
 are famous
 malayalam main aalochana sahitya bhi kisi bhi anya shakha kii tarah sampusht he
 Joseph Muntasheri and Kuttikrishna Marar drew their special opinions in criticism literature

 Both are influential in their respective fields
 inamen kuttikkrishna maaraar haal main academy dwaara puraskrit hue hai
 The late MP Paul gave a kind of affinity to the criticism literature of Malayalam
 muntshsheri, si je tomas ityadi unheen ke deepak se apni deepashikha jalaanevaale hai
 Paul's "novel Sahityam" and "aestravishikanam" are particularly noteworthy in Muntasheri's "kavyapeethika", "marroli", "antarikamsam", "manakram" and "rupabhadrata" Marar's "rajankanam", "kalyum Jeevativum" and "sahityavidya"

 a very brief introduction of Malayalam literature is given in the above paragraphs
 aaj malayalam sahitya bharat kii kisi anya bhashaa ke sahitya se peeche nahin he
 Perhaps in the areas of poetry and story, Malayalam literature is vying for a higher position than other language literature

 In British sports, a cap is a symbolic term for the presence of a player in a game at international level
 association footbal ke ek antarrashtriya match main har khilaadi ke liye ek topi dene ke liye united kingdom main abhyaas se avadhi tithiyaan
 In the early days of football, the concept of wearing a set of matching each team shirt was not universally adopted, so each side distinguished themselves from the other by wearing a specific type of hat
 1872 main scotland or england ke bich pehla antarrashtriya footbal match kaa ek praarambhik udhaaharan scottish kovels pahane khilaadiyon se pataa chalata he, or angreji skool topi kii ek kism pahane
 The practice was first approved on May 10, 1886, following a proposal made by Ann Lane Jackson, the founder of the Corinthians, to association football: ek topi dene kaa kaary ab antarrashtriya he or anya khelon ke liye aavedan kiya he
 Although in some sports physical caps may no longer always be given, the term "cap" for an international or other presence on which a player is represented has been retained as an indicator of the number of occasions in a particular sport

 The practice of giving a physical hat is different from sports

 chunaavon kaa parinaam is prakaar rahaa : Qosar Alnil Marg, also known as Qasr al-nil, is a famous route and tourist destination located in the Cairo city area of cairo, the capital of Egypt

 The design of the route and its new buildings is part of the exercise to create a new international-level urban district with the aim of connecting all new foreign ventures with the rich historical Islamic heritage of Egypt
 kosar elnil maarg purv se pashchim kii ore kuch is tarah jaati he

 abdin chowk par sthit abdin mahal se shuru hokar, ek aakarshak vyavsaayik jile se hote hue, bab el-lock bazaar, or kahiraa shahar kshetra main sthit america vishvaviddalay ke parisar se hote hue talaat herb maarg se judati he or moggama bhawan or misr kaa sangrahalay hote hue taharir chowk par jaati he
 It then crosses the Nile River and finally ends at Jezira Island
 misr ke shaashak ismil pasha ne ranneetik sooyeeboojh ke saath jazira dweep ke saamne nil nadi ke purvi kinaaron ko dobaaraa paane or nil nadi par paris banane kaa faisla liya
 The river's low-lying coastal zone of its ponds, marshes, wet soils and natural streams inhabited by millions of people made it a very promising fruitful civil engineering project
 us samay taharir chowk par maujuud 1860 me nirmit kheri pasha mahal baad main america vishvaviddalay ke parisar main aa gaya
 The project began by building barracks for Egyptian soldiers
 baad main yah mahatvapurn misri or uske baad mahatvapurn british santhaan ho gaya
 The area was part of the civilian district of Ismailia and an area of 617 acres was approved for this new project, in which the center was located Causar Alnil Road
 1874 main jab kaaphi had tak dhaanchaagat nirmaan puraa ho gaya tab ismil pasha ne bhawanon ke rakh rakhaav, saaj sajja va nirmaan aadi ke liye bahut bady raashi kharch karne kii shart rakhi jisase yahan sirf vishisht, dhanwaan or prabhaavshaalee vyakti hi rah sakate the
 Because of this, it attracted many rich people in the early years
 isaki vajah se yah kshetra bahut mahatvapurn hua, iskaa or aasapaas ke kshetron kaa teji se vikaas hua or yahan vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan batch gai
 When the British came to inspect Egypt in 1882, their first objective was to capture the barracks of the Egyptian army built on the banks of the Nile River
 angrezon ke haath main rahane ke bahut varshon baad, raja faruk ne wo barrack 1948 main waapas hathiyaa liye
 He then transferred these barracks to the east of Abbasia district
 iske baad in baiyrakon ko kahiraa kii nagarpalika ke bhawan ke rup main istemaal kiya gaya
 Because of which the Causer Alnil route changed from a center of military activity to an important area of civilian activities
 saath main lagate hue midan ismailia chauraahey ko angrezi bairaakon ko dhwast kar ke or vistaar de diya gaya
 Later it came to be known as Tahrir Chowk
 cosar elnil maarg kii vaastavik vaastukala europe ke bojor vaastukala, baroq vaastukala, noviyu kala kii yaad dilaati he
 It is influenced by modern architecture and deco art as well as Egyptian architecture, Egyptian hieroglyphic, Islamic and Moorish Renaissance styles
 purv se pashchim kii taraf kuch mahatvapurn aitihaasik sthal hai --> Pyramid of Tahrir Chaukatlat Herb Margamisraqahirnil river Qausar al-nil bridge vyangyarachana "barlesk" shabd kaa prayog england main rajasatta kii pun: sthapana se kuch varsh purv hi hua jiskaa arth pehle mukt vinod hi tha, saahitiyik paddati nahin
 It was then used as a synonym for "droll", which meant extremely comical
 ab bhi yahi arth un saahitiyik roopon ke liye prayukt hota he jo parivritti, vyangyachitran or chhadamroopak kii shrenee main aate hai
 It was first used by Skaro in 1643 and then in 1648 for his treatise "virgil's pseudo-metaphor"
 chalrs kautan ne angareji main jo iskaa anukaran kiya tha uskaa sheershak tha skaronids or virgil trawarsity 
 The term was also used for "hoodibras", which was composed in large staggered two-stanza verses, which were later accepted for all fans
 "barlesk" shabd kaa prayog ab un sabhi kavitaaon, katha-upanyaason or naatakon ke liye hota he jinamein asangat anukaran ke dwaara reeti niti, sanstha, vyakti yaa saahitiyik kritiyaan haasyaaspad tathaa vyangyatmak rup main prastut kii jaati hai yaa unki khilli udayi jaati he
 According to Jounson's definition, humorous effects are produced by deliberately creating opposites or proportions of shell and emotion in such compositions
 inamen se jinamein kisi tuchh vastu yaa bhav ko atyant vyangatmak gambhirtha ke saath prastut kiya jaataa he unhen ucch prahaasak or jinamein gambhir bhav ko atyant nimna tathaa vicitra haasyaaspad kshudrata, laghutaa yaa hinata ke saath pradarshit kiya jaataa he unhen nimna prahaasak kehete hai
 Most such compositions are intended to criticize, ridicule, or scatter, but it can also be manipulated by improper and inconsistent actions or behaviors
 is prakaar ke shuddh kaalpanik prahaasak kaa estroveganza kehete hai
 The main forms of pranks are pamphletism, satirical depictions and pseudonyms
 jis prahaasak main kisi vishesh kriti yaa lekhak yaa baad kii style yaa prakruti tathaa reeti kaa vinodpurn vikrut anukaran kiya gaya ho or jiskaa uddeshy hansee udaana yaa use nicha dikhaanaa yaa uski khilli udaana ho use parivritti kehete hai
 Sarcasm is a depiction in which a writer or work or person or person is easily characterized by distorting, distorting or distorting
 chhadmaroopak us prahaasak ko kehete hai jisamen mul vishay to jyon kaa tyon rahata he kintu uskaa pratipaadan atyant asangat tathaa tuchh bhashaa main or haasyasapad atiranjaktaa ke saath kiya jaataa he
 a combination of these three methods can also occur in a fan and sometimes even the complete abandonment of all three, especially where the universal aspects of the idea or the universal aspects of life are presented in an inconsistent way - as in the Dan Juvena of Viron
 kintu praaia: prahaasak kaa anand apratyaksh rup se prastut hasyodbodhak vishay kii pahchaan se adhik hota he isliye usamen erivritti, chhadmaroopak yaa vyangachithran praaia: apariharya hota he
 The accuser flourishes more in an era when writers or social institutions become more deserving of condemnation or criticism and when many people become more aware of the inconsistency of everything that was previously considered praiseworthy

 Two centuries later, the degraded armaments of the feudal system were completely abolished by the humor generated by "don Quixout" in which not only the inspiration for writing that type of fanatic but also the ideals was presented
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki 17 veen shatabdi ke prarambh main visheshat: england main prahaasak ke sab rup atyant prabhoot sankhya main likhe gaye
 The "huditras" style followed the following hymns and reached their culmination in the heroic verses of "mcflackno" and the Pope's "the Rape of the Louk" of high praetor "dryden"
 18 veen shatabdi ke samvegatmak or gothi upanyaason par bhi gadhy main kai prahaasak likhe gaye or unki khilli udayi gai jaise jain osten kaa "nirthenar ebe" pikuk kaa "headlong hau" tathaa "hauris hau" tathaa "thikare" kii rachanaayen
 Similarly, the poems, heroic and fantasy dramas and dance dramas of "gifford" and "harris Smith" were also successful
 naatakeey prahaasak utana hi purana he jitna sukhaant naatak yaa prahasan 
 From Comos's prosaic occultist actions, the plays of "aristophanes" developed a very grand mixture of pseudopatterns, transitions and satiricals
 elijabethy rangashaala par yadhyapi is prakaar ke prahasan bahut kam hue, phir bhi ve ullekhneey hai jaise - "shakespeare" ke "labj lebers loust" main "nine vardeez", "mid samar nits dream" main "piremas and thisbe" kaa chhadmaroopak tathaa "di nite ov di burning pasil"
 The main inspiration to the current theatrical critics was the success of "the Rehearsal" of "the George Villiers", which featured heroic dramas and satirized Dryden
 18 veen shatabdi main prahaasak ke saath sangeet ke jod dene kii pravriti badi jo bailat aupra kii hasya-nrity-natya style main chale the
 He became so popular that he became so popular in small chaotic theater that later was bound by the patented rules for the theater to not communicate without music
 is prakaar kii rachanaaon ke liye barleta shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya jise prahaasak kaa paryaayavachi samajhane kii bhul nahin kerani chahie
 In the 17th century, he meant subtle musical skit, but in the meantime, he meant a play with so much music that it would be free from the constraints of the patent rule
 19 veen shatabdi ke prarambh main is prakaar ke nimna koti ke naatakeey prahaskon ko do prakaar ke prabhaavon ne samaapt kar daalaa or unke sthaan par aa baithe
 The first is the introduction of a more elegant French style and the production of more artistic theatrical works
 france main bhi nimna koti ke naatakakaron ne do prakaar ke halke or lalit sangitamay prahaskon kii rachana kii jise faries fauliz or revyue 
 There was a lot of skillful commentary on this kind of aster, elegance, imagination, clever pun and the occasional trends that belonged to the French or English literature

 It had become very popular on American theater but with more modesty than in England, where it became very popular in the beginning due to the inspiration of kamabhavna
