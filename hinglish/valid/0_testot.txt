 Nowadays many people and chemists are using the term green chemistry according to their own, which is not based on the principles of green chemistry in any way

 Here the reactions of all actions take place and the account of all actions becomes equal
 iske liye kisi or niamak tathaa shaasha kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 If there was a provision of punishment and reward for sin and virtue, and there was a God to stop and enforce them; And if the saints were protected and the sinners were punished, then the saints like Jesus and Gandhi would not have been brutally murdered

 Spectrometry is a branch of physics in which the spectrum of electromagnetic radiations emitted or absorbed by matter is studied and from this study knowledge of the intrinsic composition of substances is obtained
 is shakha main mukhya rup se varnakram kaa hi adhyayan hota he at: ise spectrumiki yaa spectrumvigyaan kehete hai
 Originally, the study of the interaction between radiation and matter was called spectroscopy or spectroscopy
 vastut: aitihaasik rup se drushya prakaash kaa kisi prism se guzarane par alag-alag aavritiyon kaa alag-alag raste par janaa hi spectroscopy kehalaata tha
 The meaning of the term 'spectroscopy' later expanded
 ab tarangadairdhya ke falan ke rup main kisi bhi raashi kaa maapan spectroscopy kehalaati he
 Its definition was further expanded when energy was included as a variable amount kisi raashi kaa aavriti ke falan ke rup main aalekh varnakram kehalaata he
 The measurement of the density of the presence of ions, atoms or molecules in a mass of a substance is called spectrometry
 jo upkaran spectrometry main sahaayak hote hai ve spectrometer, spectrophotometer yaa spectrograph aadi naamon se jane jate hai
 Spectroscopy / spectrometry is often used in physical and analytical chemistry
 iskaa upyog khagol vigyaan evam sudur samvedan main bhi hota he
 The foundations of spectroscopy were laid by Isaac Newton in 1666 AD
 unhone ek band kamare main khidki ke chhidr se aate hue saura kiranpunj ko ek prism se hokar parde par jane diya
 Seven colors on the curtain were purple
 pattee main saato rang - laal, naarangi, pilaa, haraa, aasamaani, nila or bangnee - isi kram main dikhaai padate the
 Newton called this strip "spectrum"
 is prayog se unhone yah siddh kiya ki surya kaa shwet prakaash vastav main saat rangon kaa mishran he
 For a long time, "spectrum" was used to refer to this color band
 baad main vaigyanikon ne yah dekha ki saura spectrum ke bangnee rang se neeche bhi kuch rashmiyaan pai jaati hai jo aankh se nahin dikhaai padati hai parantu photoplate par prabhaav daalati hai or unka photo liya ja saktaa he
 These rays are called ultraviolet rays
 isi prakaar laal rang se upar avarakt kirane pai jaati hai
 Actually, the colors of all the characters are electromagnetic waves
 rangeen prakaash, avarakt, parabangnee prakaash, eks-kiran, gamma-kiran, micro tarangen tathaa radio tarangen - ye sabhi vidyucchumbakeey tarangen hai
 They all have a spectrum
 paare ko uttejit karne se jo hare rang kii kirane nikalati hai unka tarangadairghy 5461 angsterom hota he
 So now the colors of different colors are divided not on the basis of color but on the wavelength and the meaning of spectrum has become very broad - the arrangement of the colors according to the wavelength is called spectrum
 spectrumvigyaan kaa sambandh praaia: sabhi prakaar kii vidyucchumbakeey tarangon se he
 Microwave spectrum spectroscopy, infrared-spectroscopy, field of view spectroscopy, X-ray spectrometry and nuclear-spectroscopy are all part of spectroscopy, but in the prevailing sense, spectroscopy includes the study of spectrum of infrared, visible and ultraviolet rays
 newton ne surya kii kirnon se jo "spectrum" praapt kiya tha vah shuddh nahin tha arthath sabhi rang pasavaale rang se purnat: pruthak nahin the; ek rang duusare se mila tha
 The reason for this was that they poured rays from a round hole to the prism
 san 1802 i
 main volaston ne gol chhidr ke sthaan par sankri jhirri kaa prayog karke shuddh spectrum praapt kiya
 Later on, Joseph Fraunhofer obtained a pure spectrum with the help of prism and invented plane grating
 grating ek doosraa upkaran he jo vibhinn varna kii rashmiyon ko parikshepit kar detaa he
 The work of Fraunhofer assumes special significance in the advancement of spectroscopy
 san 1859 i
 main kirkhaaf or bunshan ne bahut se shuddh tattvon kaa spectrum liya or yah bataaya ki ve ek duusare se sarvatha bhinn hote hai
 Kirkhoff and Bunshan also proved that a substance whose properties can give when stirred, can give only the colors of the same character at low temperatures, but can also absorb only the colors of the same character at low temperatures
 in tatwon kii jaankaree ke baad spectrumiki kii pragati badi tivrata se hui
 This science has contributed immensely in acquiring knowledge of the formation of atomic molecules
 kisi padaarth ko vidyut yaa ooshmaa dekar uttejit kiya jaataa he tab usase prakaash nikalne lagata he
 The spectrum of rocks released from that substance depends on its internal structure
 kisi thos padaarth ko itnaa garam kiya jaae ki vah teevr chamak dene lage to usase jo spectrum praapt hota he use satat spectrum kehete hai kyonki isamen vibhinn varna kii pattiyaan ek duusari se mili juli rahati hai, unki koi seemaa nahin pai jaati he
 Similar spectrum is obtained from electric bulb and sun
 iske vipareet yadi kisi padaarth ko itani adhik urja di jaae ki use parmaanu uttejit ho jaaen to usase rekhiy spectrum miltaa he
 There are sharp lines of different colors in it
 vidyut arq tathaa kuch taron se bhi rekhiy spectrum praapt hota he
 There is also a third category of spectrum
 yadi kisi gas main kam dabaav par vidyut visarjan kiya jaae to ve gaisen uttejit hokar sapatt spectrum detii hai
 In this spectrum, several plates are found apart from each other, one end of which is sharp and the other is tarnished respectively
 ye sabhi spectrum utsarjit spectrum kahe jate hai
 If all the colors of the letter are sent from within a substance, it absorbs those quantities which it can emit itself
 bijli ke balve se drishyakshetra kii sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai
 If there is a steam of sodium in a tube and by sending the light of the bulb from within it, the spectrum of outward light is taken, then two black lines are found in its yellow part
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki sodium swayan uttejit hone par rekhiy spectrum detaa he
 There are also two yellow lines in this spectrum called the "D" lines of sodium
 jab balb kaa prakaash sodium kii bhaap se hokar jaataa he to sodium di rekhaon ke anukool varna ko avashoshit kar letaa he or barhigat prakaash main isi sthaan par do kaali rekhaayen ban jaati hai
 This spectrum is called the absorption spectrum
 avasorana spectrum bhi teen prakaar ke hote hai
 The absorption spectrum in which the black lines are found is called the linear absorption spectrum, in which the black bands are found, the band absorption spectrum and in which only a slightly more continuous region of the spectrum is absorbed is called the continuous absorption spectrum
 spectrum praapt karne ke liye jin upkarnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he unhen spectrumdarshi, spectrummapi or spectrumlekhi kehete hai
 Each spectrographic spectroscope has three main components
 pehla bhaag strot se aanevaali rashmiyon ko uchit disha main niyantrit karata he, doosraa bhaag vibhinn varnon ko pruthak karata arthath mishrit rashmiyon ko parikshepit karata he tathaa teesraa bhaag unhen alag alag ek nabhital par focus karata he
 If the device only has a system of viewing the spectrum, then it is called a spectroscope, if there is also a system of reading the deviation of different characters of the spectrum by rotating its third part, then it is called a spectrometer, from which a permanent picture of the spectrum can be taken
 sabhi spectrolekhi banaavat main lagbhag samaan hote hai kintu parikshepan ke liye do saadhan kaam main laae jate hai - prism or grating
 Hence spectrographs are also of two types - prism spectrograph and grating spectrograph
 adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye spectrum ko vibhinn kshetron main baant liya gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of three things - Rashmisrot, reflection method and recording
 spectrumiki vibhaag main nimnaankit kshetron kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he - sudur avaraktakiran drishyakshetra, parabangnee kshetra or nirvaat parabangnee kshetra
 Different types of spectrography are used in different parts
 sarini main vibhinn kshetron kii seemaa, parikshepan yantra or abhilekhan yantron kaa sankshipt vivaran diya gaya he- There are three types of spectrum - linear, banded and continuous
 rekhiy spectrum main kel rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 In the banded spectrum, band bands are found, one edge of which is sharp and the other is tarnished respectively
 satat spectrum main sabhi varna kii rashmiyaan ek duusare se sanlagn rahati hai
 Suitable amount of spectrum is used to obtain various spectrums
 rekhiy spectrum uttejit parmaanuon dwaara praapt hota he
 They require heat, electric or highly energetic electromagnetic rings to excite
 saamanyat: vidyut arq or vidyut spark upyog main aate hai
 Atoms are also excited by flame, heat furnace and electric immersion
 vidyut arq - dhaatu ke do electrode ek vishesh prakaar ke stambh main kas die jate hai kintu stambh se pruthgnyast rahete hai
 The space between the electrodes can be reduced or increased by rotating a screwhead
 donon electrode ek parivartaneey avrodh tathaa ek prerakatv shreneekram main jod die jate hai
 Initially both electrodes are connected to drive the arc, so the electrical circuit is completed and current starts flowing
 jahaan electrode satate hai us bindu par bheeshan ooshmaa ootpann hoti he kyonki vahaan avrodh atyant kam hone se sahasaa hajaaron ampior kii dhara pravaahit hoti he
 This heat causes the electrode to evaporate, and even after slightly dissolving them, this steam continues to complete the electrical circuit
 is bhaag main sthit anu-parmaanu uttejit hokar prakaash dene lagate hai
 Arc temperature is about 3500 c From 8000 cm Happens till
 mukhya taar arq chalaane ke purv electrodon ke bich kaa vibhavantar main ke vibhavantar ke baraabar hota he kintu arq chalate samay yah ghat jaataa he
 Arcs are also run from the alternating stream
 aajkal kai prakaar ke sudhare hue arq uplabdh hai
 Electric blasting - is almost like an arc, but the difference of the electrodes of the blasting is several hundred times greater than the arc
 yahi kaaran he ki sphuling kaa stambh adhik surakshit tathaa electrodon se bhalee bhanti pruthgnyast rakhaa jaataa he
 The electrodes are connected to the secondary ends of a stop-up transformer
 sphuling rikt sthaan kaa vibhavantar 10,000 wo
 se 50,000 volt tak hota he; at: is strot main anu-parmaanuon ko atyadhik uttejnaa milti he
 Sphaling spaces can be increased or subtracted at will
 is strot main uttejit honevaale anu parmaanuon ko bahut adhik urja praapt hoti he
 Hence they are ionized
 parmaanu yaa anu ke cendrak ke chaaron or bahut se electron ghoomte rahete hai
 These electrons are divided into different orbits according to certain rules
 sabase baharwali kaksha ke electranon ko "optical electron" kaha jaataa he
 If one or more optical electrons are removed from a molecule or atom, it is said to be "ionized"
 keval ek electron nikal jane par parmaanu pehali ynit sthiti main ho jaataa he
 If the second, third etc
 electrons are also removed, the atom goes into the second, third etc
 ionized position respectively
 in sthitiyon ke liye uttarottar adhik urja deni hoti he
 The 23rd ionized state of tin has been achieved by extremely high-intensity sphilling
 spectro rasinic vishleshan ke liye vidyut sphuling mukhya rup se upyogi hota he
 a variety of improvements have been made to keep the sphincter running continuously
 padaarthon ko prajvalit karne yaa bunsan jwalk kii jwaala main jalaane par pattdaar spectrum praapt hota he
 Plated spectrum can also be obtained by igniting some substances in an electric arc
 gaison main vidyut visarjan se pattdaar spectrum badi suvidha se praapt hote hai
 For electric immersion, filling the gas in a tube at very low pressure has to give a difference of several thousand volts between its ends
 nion gas main vidyut visarjan se rakt varna kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai
 Now-a-days immersion tubes of the size of letters and pictures are made for display and publicity in which neon gas is filled
 inhen nion sin kehete hai
 If a solid substance is given so much heat that it starts glowing red then it continuously emits Rashmipunj
 bijli ke balve se drishyakshetra main satat spectrum paane ke liye vishesh prakaar ke hydrogen lamp, zeenaan arq lamp tathaa paarad-vaashp visarjan kaam main laae jate hai
 Spectrographs are used to obtain a permanent spectrum of the sorghum emitted from different types of spermatozoa
 prayek spectrolekhi main laayaa hua parikshepan sanyantr vibhinn varna kii mishrit rashmiyon ko pruthak kar detaa he
 The dispersion of stones is in three ways: jab rashmiyaan kisi prism se hokar jaati hai tab apvartan ke kaaran pruthak ho jaati hai
 This is called refractory reflection; yadi bahut si sankri jhiriyon ko ek duusari ke samaantar paas paas rakhkar unamem se mishrit prakashpunj bheja jaae to vivartan ke kaaran rashmiyaan alag alag ho jaati hai or spectrum ban jaataa he
 Such dispersion is called invertible reflection; rashmiyon ke vyatikaran dwaara bhi parikshepan utpann kiya jaataa he
 The first two methods are more common
 iske teen mukhya bhaag hote hai - collemetter, prism or camera
 a collimator is a hollow tube with a thin end on one end and a lens on the other end
 zairi or lens kii duuri parivartaneey hoti he tathaa zairi kii chaudaai bhi parivartaneey hoti he tathaa zairi kii chaudaai bhi parivartaneey hoti he
 The prism is thus placed on a firm base
 ki lens se aanevaala samaantar rashmipunj isapar pade
 The spheres reflected from the prism go into the camera and are focused on the photoplatte by the camera lens
 puri vyavastha ek saath is prakaar dhaki rahati he ki zairi ke atirikt or kahin se bhi prakaash bheetar na ja sake
 Such are the spectrographs generally used in the visual and ultraviolet fields
 drishyakshetra main kaam aanevaale spectrolekhi main kaanch ke lens or prism lage rahete hai
 Prisms and lenses of quartz, fluoride, and fluoride are used for the ultraviolet region
 duurastha avarakt ke liye upyogi prism nahin milte hai
 Spectrographs with two or three prisms are designed to increase the deflection
 nirvaat parabangnee kshetra ke liye aise spectrograph kaam aate hai jinase vaayu nikaal di jaati he
 These are called vacuum spectrographs
 ye bade moolyawaan hote hai
 Special types of spectrometers are used for infrared
 infrared spectrometer se kisi padaarth kaa shoshan varnakram praapt hota he
 Continuous infrared rocks are allowed to pass through the material
 padaarth se nikalne ke baad inhen prism yaa grating se vikshepit kiya jaataa he
 The deflected rocks are recorded by thermoelectric recorders
 in spectrometeron main chloride tathaa fluoride ke prism lage rahete hai or lenson ke sthaan par dhaatu kii kalivaale darpan lagaae jate hai
 The grating that is formed by keeping several narrow wrinkles parallel is called grating
 yadi svachh paardarshak kaanch par samaantar rekhaayen khurch di jaaen to pratyak do rekhaon ke bich kaa paardarshak sthaan zairi kaa kaam detaa he
 Such glass is called flat permeable grating
 inkaa upyog prism kii hi bhanti simit he
 If aluminum or silver is cut on a curved surface and parallel lines are scraped on it, this device is called concave reflective grating
 prayek do rekhaon ke bich kaa tal rashmiyon ko paravartit kar detaa he, inhen paravartit rashmiyon ke vivartan se spectrum praapt hota he
 This type of grating was first created by Henry Roland in 1882 AD
 rekhaayen khurachne ke liye rolland ne ruling mashin bhi banaai thi jo sudhaare hue rup main ab bhi prachlit he
 Curve grating spectrography does not require a lens
 rashmipunj ek sankri zairi se hokar grating par padataa he
 Reflected springs are automatically centered on a circle
 is vrutt ko "rolland vrutt" kehete hai
 The curve on which the lines are scratched is called "grating black"
 rolland vrutt kaa ardhavyas "blike" ke vakrathardhavyas kaa aadha hota he
 This circle touches the grating at the point where its diameter is normal to the grating
 isi abhilamb ke duusare sire par zairi kaa pratyaksh bimb banataa he
 This is called zero-grade spectrum
 iske donon ore rolland vrutt par jo sarvapratham spectrum paae jate hai unhen pratham koti kaa spectrum kaha jaataa he
 Several spectrums of low intensity are found on the same circle and further respectively
 inhen kramash: dwitiya, tritiy aadi koti kaa spectrum kaha jaataa he
 The utility of a spectrograph depends on two things
 pehali uski parikshepan kshamta or duusari vibhedan kshamta he
 The more wavelengths of different wavelengths separated by each dispersion plant as they exit the spectral plant, the higher the reflectivity of that spectrograph
 isi prakaar do atyant sameepvarti tarangadairghy kii rekhaon ko ek duusari se thik thik alag dikhaane kii kshamta ko vibhedankshmata kehete hai
 If two lines are taken in a spectrum in which the wavelength of one is λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda}} and the other is λ { \ displaystyle { \ lambda}} + δ λ { \ displaystyle { \ Delta \ lambda}} more In the differential spectrograph, the two lines appear to be distinct from each other, but in the less differential spectrograph, only one line appears
 vibhedankshmata ko nimnlikhit anupaat dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 r = λ δ λ { \ displaystyle r = { \ lambda \ over \ Delta \ lambda}} spectrolekhi main parikshepit rashmiyon kaa photo utaar liya jaataa he
 This is called a spectrograph
 jahaan photo nahin utaara ja saktaa he vahaan rashmiyon kaa abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 The tools used for photographing and recording are called "dictators"
 spectramiki ke vibhinn kshetron main vibhinn prakaar ke dictator kaam main laae jate hai
 Interferometer is used to determine the wavelength of a monochromatic resin very accurately
 faverypero interpherometer or micelson interpherometer is kaary ke liye atyadhik upyogi hote hai
 The wavelength of all the lines is difficult and often unambiguous to be determined from the personometer, so the sharp and sharp lines of an element are considered to be the primary standard and with this the wavelengths of other lines are determined
 kadgium tatv kii jaal rekha kaa tarangadairghy 6438
4696 a ko praathmik maanak mana gaya he
 Recently, many scientists have decided to consider 5015
6784 as the primary standard for helium gas
 shuddh louh tathaa viral gaison ke tarangadairghy gaun maadak maane jate hai
 When taking a photo of a spectrum, the photoplot is taken in-place, taking the spectrum of the main spectrum as well as the iron or copper electrocard and comparing it with the lines, with the help of formulas, determine the wavelength of the spectrum's lines or bands

 rekhaon kii parsparik dooriyaan camparator naamak upkaran kaa sahaayta se maapi jaati hai
 Each atom has a nucleus
 iske chaaron ore kai electron niyat kakshaon main ghoomte rahete hai
 The total number of electrons is equal to the number of ports of the nucleus
 bhinn-bhinn kakshaon main electranon kii sankhya bhi niyat hoti he
 Any electron can remain in a fixed orbit
 vastav main ye kakshaayen parmaanu kii urjasthiti kii dyotak hoti hai
 If an electron moves to another empty orbit, the energy state of the atom changes
 bhitari kakshaon ke electranon kaa hatana praaia: sambhav nahin hota he kintu antim kaksha kaa electron bahari ooshmaa yaa vidyut shakti se uttejit hone par agali kaksha main ja saktaa he
 If the energy associated with it is K1 in the first orbit and K2 in the next orbit, then the electron can only take K2 - K1 energy to move from the first to the second higher energy state
 uttejit str par jane ke baad hi vah pun: purvasthiti main waapas aata he or k2 - k1 urja utsarjit karata he
 The value of this emitted or absorbed energy is only hn, that is, the electron can take or give a fixed energy point to move or return from one energy level to the next energy level
 isse kam urja kaa aadan-pradaan nahin ho saktaa he
 h is a constant number and n is the frequency of emission emitted
 h n arg urja kaa ek packet yaa "kwantum" kaha jaataa he
 Likewise, when electrons transition to other energetics, different frequencies are obtained and corresponding lines are formed in the spectrum
 anu, parmaanuon main electranon kii vyavastha ke anusaar kai electranik urjaster paae jate hai or electranik sankraman ke kaaran vibhinn prakaar ke spectrum praapt hote hai
 Only electronic energy states are found in atoms
 at: electranon ke sankraman se nishchit tarangadairghy kii rashmiyaan nikalati hai or rekhiy spectrum praapt hota he
 Molecules have three types of energy - electronic, vibrational and rotational
 electranik urja kaa maan or bhi kam hota he
 Just as electronic energy states are fixed, similarly vibrational and rotational energy conditions are also fixed
 at: kampanjnya sankraman se patt yaa band praapt hota he
 The lines are obtained from the rotational transition in each bed
 ye bahut paas paas hoti hai at: chote spectrodarshi se alag-alag nahin dikhaai padati hai or spectrum main vibhinn varna ke band hi dikhaai padate hai
 These lines can be seen from spectroscopes with high reflectivity and resolution

 China was once reunited in the Sui dynasty's reign in 580 CE, but the Sui dynasty remained for a few years and the Sui dynasty collapsed following defeat in the goguryeo-sui Wars

 The Song dynasty was the first government in world history to issue paper currency and the first Chinese civilian system to establish a permanent navy

 The main reason for this increase was the spread of rice cultivation to central and southern China and the abundant production of food items

 The Song Dynasty was China's culturally golden period when art, literature and social life in China progressed greatly
 saatvin se barahavin sadi tak china vishwa kaa sabase susanskrit desh ban gaya
 In 1271 the Mongol chieftain Kubalaya Khan established the Yuan Radd dynasty, which retained its suzerainty by 1279, removing the Song dynasty from power

 terahavin sadi se pashchimi deshon ne china se sambandh kaayam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 At this time China was ruled by the Yuans
 mongolon ne isi kaal main china par akraman kiya
 Europe's famous traveler and businessman Marcopolo arrived from Venice with his father and uncle in China at the same time
 alp kaal ke liye usne kublaai khan ke darbar main naukari bhi kii
 But his service career is not as important as his travel diary
 is diary main usne china ke sambandh main charchaa kii jiske falswaroop pashchimi deshon kaa dhyaan china kii ore gaya
 At the same time, many travelers from Italy cities came to China in connection with traveling to the Near East
 iske atirikt roman catholicon ne bhi china se sambandh kaayam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But whatever efforts these countries made to establish contact with China from the late thirteenth century to the latter part of the fourteenth century is not of any importance from any point of view
 is samay china main pravisht yatriyon kii sankhya bhi alp hi thi
 But it is so right that from this time the attention of European countries went towards the rich countries of Asia and they started trying to dominate them in the coming centuries
 jab china main ming-shashan prarambh hua, tab in yatriyon ne punah china kii yatra kerani prarambh kii
 At this time also, there were many travel related inconveniences as before
 unheen ke kaaran videshi is kaal main bhi china se ghanishtha sampark kaayam nahin kar sake
 The biggest of these inconveniences was traffic related inconvenience
 china or europea deshon ke madhya abhi bhi vyapaarik sambandh kaayam tha, lekin avaagaman kii in asuvidhaon ke chalate abhi bhi anek vyapaarik kathinaaiyaan uth jaati thim
 All the merchants of Europe and Asia, with their merchant ships, first landed in Lalsagar and crossed it and after that, cruising Egypt, they came and landed in the Mediterranean
 vyapaar karne kaa anya maarg bhi tha
 They began their business journey from the Gulf of Iran
 yatra ke silsile main iraan kii khadi se prasthaan kar basra, baghdad, makka aadi deshon kii yatra karte hue asia miner pahonchte the
 In this way, due to the inconvenience of this traffic, on one hand these merchants could not maintain their economic relations with certain countries, on the other hand they had to waste a lot of time
 vastav main, yahi kaaran tha jiske chalate in dinon purvi deshon ke saath pashchimi desh sambandh kaayam nahin kar sake
 Not only this, in the latter part of the fifteenth century their remaining merchant routes were also blocked
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki 1453 i
 main turk jati kaa ek mahaan vijeta muhamd dwitiya ne kustuntuniya par adhikaar kar liya or unke vyapaarik maarg ko band kar diya
 Nevertheless, these inconveniences also led to the struggle of Western travelers and businessmen and to some extent established relations with China
 mongol shaasha yuan jab tak jivit rahaa tab tak china se videshiyon kaa kuch-na-kuch sampark avashya kaayam rahaa
 But as soon as it died, it seemed that now their mutual relations would end
 lekin ming samraaton ne is sambandh ko purnjivit kiya or pashchimi deshon kii ore unmukh hue
 As time passed, the merchants of western countries could not forget the economic prosperity of the eastern countries
 marcopolo kii diary unke liye prerana-strot hi ban gayi thi faltah pandrahavin sadi ke ant or solahavin sadi ke armbh ke bich in yatriyon kii yatra punah hone lagi or unka vistaar bhi hone laga
 At this time, the Spanish, Dutch and Russian castes helped to advance relations towards the eastern and northern regions of Asia
 spain or portugal ne prerana paakar colombo naamak prasiddh yatri ne bhi yatra kii or sudur purv ke deshon main pahunchne kaa prayaas kiya
 The Portuguese arrived in Macao in 1511 AD and came directly to Chinese soil in 1514 AD
 chiniyon ne in portugaliyon ko asabhy tathaa dukhadaayak mana
 They permanently resided in Macao
 china ke prasiddh bandargah canton ke nikat hi yah makaao avasthit he jahaan aajkal bhi acchhee sankhya main portugali nivas karte hai
 At this time the British also came to China
 jab mig vansh kaa shashan samaapt ho rahaa tha or manchu samraat shashan prarambh hone vaala tha, britain ke angrej china aa dhamke
 He became the most influential in China and received the credit for opening the door of China to trade in Western countries
 in vibhinn jatiyon ke aagaman kaa kramik adhyayan karnaa aavashyak prathit hota he
 In East Asia, the caste that first arrived during the reign of the Ming dynasty was Portuguese

 Therefore, his departure and expansion now started in other countries as well
 16 veen sadi ke prarambh main hi malakka par adhikaar karne ke samay ve china pahunch gayi
 He reached China in 1514 AD
 china aate hi ve vyapaarik kaaryon main sanlagn ho gayi
 Traders here started buying luxury items from China and selling them in Western countries where there was a demand for cosmetics
 lekin portuguese apane vyavhaar se chiniyon ko prasann nahin kar sake
 Their behavior and habits were not good, not only were the Portuguese bad, other castes also had similar habits
 spain ke log jab america pahunche tab vahaan kii moulik jatiyon kaa jivan bhi unke chalate atyant kshtprad ho gaya
 The people of Spain did not leave America even after being opposed and built settlements there and settled regularly
 niyamit rup se basate hi ve american logon ke dharm, samskruti rahan-sahan vagairah main hastkshep karne lage
 Not only this, along with the construction of settlements, he also oriented towards colonization; in this connection the Spaniards also reached China
 portugijon ke baad spanish hi china aaye
 The people of China were familiar with the kind of action this caste had done in America
 isliye china kii dharti par upnivesh-nirmaan kaa beej liye jaise hi is jati kaa aagaman hua, vaise hi chiniyon ne inkaa virodh karnaa prarambh kiya
 The Ming government even started a vigorous movement against this caste
 yahi kaaran hua ki america kii tarah china main spain waalon kii daal nahin gal saki
 They could neither maintain their existence in China nor could they build the desired settlements
 portugijon se bhi vyapaarik sambandh kaayam ho gayi the
 This relationship could not be established with them
 phir bhi spanish jidd ke pakke the
 The way they started living forcefully in America, they also tried to stay in China
 inkaa ek jattha china ke prasiddh bandargah canton main thahar gaya or china se vyapaarik sambandh kaayam karne kaa prayaas karne laga
 Finally, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, he succeeded in his work and started to build his settlement in Macao
 isi samay pashchim kii anek dharmik mishnariyaan bhi china aayin
 In China, these missionaries started propagating religion
 prarambh main in mishnariyon ke vyavhaar achche the, lekin baad main unki swarthpurna niti se china ke log parichit hue
 At the same time, the British and Dutch also arrived in China
 lekin yahan yah baat yaad rakhni chahie ki mingvansh ke shashan main china kaa pashchimi deshon se do prakaar ke sambandh kaayam hue-ek vyapaarik sambandh or doosraa dharmik sambandh
 The countries of the west traded the plots of the south with Macao and Canton
 pashchim ke vyapaaree china main apane deshon se anaaj sambandhi anek paudhe tathaa tambaaku laae
 These people promoted tobacco a lot
 inhen ke chalate china ke adhikansh log tambaaku kaa seven karne lage
 Similarly, his religious relationship with China was also maintained
 china ke bhitari ilaakon main pashchimi deshon kii mishnariyaan dharm-prachaar kaa kaary karti thi
 After the Mongols rule, Christians in China had come to an end and their influence began to decline
 lekin mingvansh ke shashan ke antim varshon main roman cathalikon ne in isaayiyon tathaa unki mishnariyon ko punarujjivit kiya
 At the same time, people from xxwrep 4 France, Agustinian, Jusite, Dominion, etc
 many religious sects reached China
 solahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main hi jesuit sampradaay kii pradhanta china main kaayam hone lagi
 The popular promotion of this community was Francis Xavier, who tirelessly and tirelessly tried to popularize this community in South and East Asia
 isi prachaarak ne na is sampradaay kaa prachaar china main bhi kiya
 In fact, the cult was able to survive in China only due to Xavier
 abhi jevisarya ko apane kaary main puri safalataa bhi nahin mili thi ki 1556 i

 After his death, the work of his work was carried by Methihar Rikki on his shoulders
 ricki italy kaa nivasee tha
 Rikki's genius was multi-faceted to increase the popularity of the Jesuit community
 vah jyotish tathaa ganit kaa prakand vidwaan tha
 Historians speculate that at present there was no such scholar of astrology and mathematics in China who could equal Rikki
 apane pratibha ke chalate hi usne china sahitya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 This was a completely new subject for Chinese literature Rikki, yet due to his studies and talent, he gained a lot of prestige among Chinese litterateurs
 apane dharm kaa adhyayan to use tha hi, usne canfusius ke dharm tathaa isai dharm kaa kaaphi gaharaa adhyayan kiya or donon dharmon kii samanta tathaa asamanta ko ek vidwaan ke rup main rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 He made his residence in Peking, the capital of China
 isi samay philippine se spanian bhi china aayaa
 By now many Western castes had come into China
 1516 i
 main portuguese aa gayi the, 1575 i
 main spanish aa gayi the; dachon kaa aagaman 1604 i
 main hua tha or angrej 1637 i

 But by this time the Americans and Russians could not come
 ching shashan-kaal main inkaa aagaman bhi china main ho gaya
 The rule of the Ming dynasty came to an end in 1644 AD
 uttar main manchu naamak vijetaon ne ming ko parrast kiya
 Manchu was a resident of Manchuria
 sohalvin sadi ke uttararddh tathaa satrahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main unhone apane ko shaktishaalee bana liya or ming se mukden apahrit kar liya jo unki rajdhani bhi thi
 They also made Mukden their capital
 china main rahanevaale mongolon ne bhi ichha yaa anichhaa se manchuon ke shashan ko sweekaar kar liya
 The Manchus attempted to extend their state-limits to the southern wall of China
 isi samay jab china main ming ke viruddh asantosh kii bhaavana kaa janm hua tab mauka paakar manchuo ne peking par apana adhikaar kar liya or tabhi se ve china main shashan karne lage
 Kangxi and China Lung were the most powerful kings of this dynasty
 dirghakaal tak manchuo ne china par shashan kiya
 Westerners also came to China in Manchukaal
 agar sach poocha jaay to yah maananaa padegaa ki isi kaal main china main paashchaatya deshon ke prabhaav kii jad jamani prarambh hui or isi kaal main videshon se china kaa vaastavik sambandh kaayam hua
 During this period people from abroad came from both the place and both routes
 samudr ke raste se portuguese, spanish, french tathaa angrej or kuch italian tathaa german aaye
 At the same time, American traders also came to China in 1784 AD
 jameen ke maarg se keval rus ke log aaye jo china main chaandi kaa vyapaar karne lage
 Also signed a treaty with foreign states in China at this time
 is sandhi ke dwaara rus ko peking main ek mishan bhejne kaa adhikaar mila
 Russian missionaries also started working in Peking
 america or rus se yah sambandh china ke liye mahatvapurn siddh hua
 Foreign missionaries also arrived in China at this time
 atharahavin sadi ke china main is samay punah videshi mishnariyon kaa bhi aagaman hua
 By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the number of Christians in China had grown to 300,000
 1793 i
 main sarvapratham angrejon kaa ek mishan china aayaa
 The mission came to China under mccartney's leadership
 doosraa mishan 1816 i
 main peking aayaa
 It was led by Lord Amherst
 isi samay rabart morishan ke adheen bhi ek mishan china pahunchaa
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, now the Protestant missionaries started their work in China
 protestent log chiniyon ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unhen asabhy samajhate the
 Dutch missionaries also visited China and their first mission reached China in 1795 AD
 isi prakaar 1806 i
 main rus kaa ek doot aayaa
 But China did not show any sympathy towards him
 peking main france ke jemuit bhi pahunche or manchu samraat kii gaurav-gaatha gane lage
 Among the various missionaries, the most clever and influential British proved to be the missionaries of the British
 china main aayi vibhinn mishnariyon se agar angrej mishanri kii tulana kii jaay to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki atharahavin sadi ke ant or unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main hi angreji mishanri sabhi se aage nikal gayi
 The reason for this was that the British were very clever and hard-working
 apni vyapaarik kushalta tathaa raajnneeti chaturata ke chalate unhone anya mishnariyon ko pratiyogita main aage nahin badhane diya or bhavishya main china main ve apana prabhaav kaayam karne main samarth hue
 It is clear from the above description that the relationship between China and Western countries was established and by the nineteenth century, many foreigners and their missionaries had become visible all over China
 lekin vah sambandh shantipurvak aage na chal sakaa
 People's government of China gradually began to hate these foreigners and their missionaries
 unka vichaar tha, ki paashchaatya deshon se sampark badhaane par china kii sabhyataa tathaa samskruti nasht ho sakati he, isliye china ne paashchaatya pravritiyon kaa anubhav kiya or unase pruthak rahane kaa prayaas kiya
 Even after coming into contact with Western countries, he adopted his dress, religion and customs
 yahi kaaran tha ki manchu sarkaar khule rup se in paashchaatya deshon se pruthak rahane kaa prayaas karne lagi is baat ko drushti main rakhkar samraat kangehsee ne ek rajkeey vijyapti nikaali or china-pravesh se in jatiyon tathaa mishnariyon ko vanchit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The emperor had his own sentiment behind this communique, but at the same time he had to remove this communion to satisfy the people of China
 china kii janata in videshiyon se ghrinaa karne lagi thi or yah sambhaavna kii jane lagi ki china main khun-kharabi bhi ho sakati he
 There was considerable dissatisfaction in China, especially from foreign missionaries
 ‘‘mishanri ke vibhinn adeshon ke bich jhagade, purvajon kaa aadar karte hue kuch dharm pravartit logon kaa samrat ke hukum kii manyata tathaa saath hi naye dharm kii pravriti ke prati unke afasaron ke pratinidhitiv ke dwaara unki satta kii nunata ne dhire-dhire bhraamak vichaaron ke prachaarak ke vaastavik charitra ke prati unki ankhen khol deen
 But it should be remembered that according to this release, foreigners who came to China were not evacuated from China
 keval un par yaa vibhinn deshon se aaye hue vyapaariyon par ek prakaar kaa niyantran rakhane kii baat kahi gayi
 The Manchu government of China had feared that if these merchants were not allowed to trade, they would try to spread unrest by spreading all over China
 isliye is vijyapti main yah spasht kar diya gaya ki ye videshi vyapaaree china ke sabhi tatavarti bandargahon se shantipurvak uchit vyapaar kar sakate hai
 The happiness of foreigners was not open as soon as they were allowed to do business, because they got this permission in a very easy manner
 isse unka utsaah or hausala donon badha
 As a result, due to lack of meaning, these people also started doing illegal business
 ve un vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa bhi durupyog karne lage jo unhen praapt hue the
 Naturally the attention of the Chinese government was again attracted to him
 isiilie manchu vansh ke duusare samrat chien lug ne 1757 i
 main ek duusari vijyapti nikaali jiske chalate vaideshik vyapaar ko china main simit kar diya gaya or vyapaariyon par anek prakaar ke pratibandh lagaaye gayi
 According to this release, these foreign traders were allowed to trade with only one port of southern China
 iske atirikt china main ek vyapaarik dal kaa sanghathan kiya gaya jise ‘ko-hang’ kaha gaya
 Foreign traders could trade with China only under the consultation and supervision of this team
 is tarah atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main un vyapaariyon kii chaal par china kii sarkaar ne ek paini drushti rakhi or yah spasht kar diya ki ve vyapaarik maamalon ke liye kisi anya bandargah kaa daura nahin kar sakate hai
