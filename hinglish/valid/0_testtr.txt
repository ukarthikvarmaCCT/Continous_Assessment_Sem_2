 medical collejon or vishvavidhyalayon main chikitsa snaatak paathyakram main dakhile ke samay bade paimaane par hone vaali dhaandhlee rokane kii maang lambey samay se kii ja rahi thi
 For this, it was being suggested to implement a centralized entrance examination system
 ejineering collejon main yah prakriya lagu thi magar nijee collejon or rajya sarkaron kii anichhaa ke chalate is disha main koi kadam nahin uthaaya ja paa rahaa tha
 Earlier this exam was called 'AIPMT'
 yah pariksha deshbhar main ek saath hoti thi
 Based on the marks obtained in this examination, students were admitted to medical institutions run by the Central Government
 lekin sarkaar ne paardarshita, medical shiksha main ucch maanak sthapit karne or chaatro ko kai parikshaon ke boj se bachaane ke liye desh bhar ke medical collejon main daakhile ke liye ek pariksha yojit karaane kaa faisla liya
 NEET entrance examination is done by Central Board of Secondary Education i
e
 CBSE
 chhipi baat nahin he ki chikitsa sansthaanon main daakhile ke liye hode lagi rahati he
 Since after studying medical science there is no problem of employment like that after other technical courses
 isliye paathyakram main daakhile ke liye kuch adhik bheed rahati he
 Since there is a provision of management quota in private institutions and the colleges themselves decide the conditions for admission, the children of people with money are occupied in most seats there
 in paathyakramon main munhmaangi rakam dene waalon kii qatari lagi rahati he
 Obviously, running a college for management has become a big earning business
 magar daakhile main paardarshita or vyaavhaarik vyavastha na hone ke chalate bahut saare medhaavi vidhyaarthiyon ko daakhile se vanchit hona padataa he
 The Supreme Court had ordered the implementation of NEET based on the consent of the Central Government, Medical Council of India and Central Board of Secondary Education
 magar kuch rajyon ko is par aapatti thi ki isse kshetreey bhashaa main samaan paathyakram taiyaar karne or pravesh parikshaayen yojit karaane aadi main mushkil aa sakati he
 On this basis, the Center prepared the notification
 magar kanoonee aadchan thi ki kya sarvocch nyaayalay ke kisi faisle ke khilaaf sarkaar adhyadesh laa sakati he? raashtrapati ne is par kanoonee salaah lee or aakhirkaar adhyadesh ko hari jhandi dikhaa di
 In this way, the rigging of quota will stop at the time of admission in medical institutions
 abhi tak nijee or sarkari collejon main management, enarai aadi ke liye jo cote nirdhaarit hai, un siton par college khud daakhile kii sharten tay karte hai
 But now all kinds of quota can be filled only through central examination

 This action results in more channels opening, producing more electric current and so on
 yah prakriya visphotak rup se tab tak aage badhati rahati he jab tak ki sabhi uplabdh aayan channel khul nahin jate, jiske falswaroop jhilli kshamta main ek vishaal oochaal aata he
 The rapid inflow of sodium ions reverses the polarity of the plasma membrane, and the ion channels are rapidly inactivated thereafter
 sodium channelon ke band hone par, sodium aayan ab neuron main pravesh nahin kar sakate or ve sakriy rup se plasma jhilli pahunchaaya jaataa he
 The potassium channels are then activated and there is an outward current of potassium ions, which brings the electrochemical gradient back to the resting state
 ek acshan potenshial ke ho jane ke baad, vahaan ek kshanik nakaaratmak badlaav hota he, jise atirikt potacium dhaaraon ke kaaran afterhyperpolaraijeshan yaa du:saadhy avadhi kaha jaataa he
 This is the mechanism that prevents an action potential from traveling back the way it came
 pashu koshikaon main, acshan potenshial ke do mukhya prakaar hai, pehla prakaar voltage-gated sodium channelon dwaara utpann hota he or doosraa prakaar voltage-gated calcium channelon dwaara
 sodium-aadhaarit acshan potenshial aam taur par ek milisecond se kam samay tak chalate hai, jabaki calcium-aadhaarit acshan potenshial 100 milisecond yaa zyada samay tak chal sakate hai
 In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitting sodium spikes
 duusari taraf, hriday kii mansapeshi koshikaon main, ek aarambhik teevr sodium spike, ek calcium spike kii teevr shuruyaat ko uksaane ke liye ek "primer" pradaan karata he, jo tab mansapeshi sankuchan ko utpann karata he
 All cells in animal body tissue are electrically polar - in other words, they maintain a voltage variation around the cell's plasma membrane, known as the membrane potential
 yah vidyutiya dhruvikaran, aayan pump naamak jhilli main sannihit protein sanrachanaon or aayan channel ke bich jatil paraspar kriya se falit hota he
 In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane are usually different in different parts of the cell, imparting different electrical properties to the dendrite, axon, and cell body
 ek parinaam ke rup main, neuron ke jhilli ke kuch bhaag uttejneey ho sakate hai, jabaki anya nahin hote hai
 The most excitable part of the neuron is usually the axon hill, but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases
 jhilli ke prayek uttejneey ptch main jhilli kshamta kaa do mahatvapurn str hota he: vishram kshamta, jo vah maan he jise jhilli kshamta tab tak banaae rakhti he jab tak koshika ko koi chiz pareshaan nahin karti or ek ucch maan jo aarambhik kshamta kehalaata he
 On the axon hill of a specific neuron, the resting potential is around −70 mv and the initial potential is around −55 mv
 ek neuron main syneptic input ke kaaran jhilli vidhruviya yaa ati-dhruviya ho jaati he; arthath ve jhilli kshamta ko badhane yaa ghatane ke liye prerit karte hai
 The action potential is triggered when sufficient depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential to the limit
 jab ek acshan potenshial chaalu hota he, tab jhilli kshamta achaanak upar kii ore uthati he, jo aksar +100 mv tak pahunchati he or phir samaan rup se achaanak waapas neeche girti he, jo aksar vishram str se neeche samaapt hoti he, jahaan yah kuch samay ke liye rahati he
 The size of the action potential is conservative; That is, the amplitude and the period of rise and fall for all action potentials in a given cell are usually approximately the same
 adhikansh neurons main, puri prakriya ek second ke hajaarwein bhaag main ghatati he
 Many forms of neurons emit action potentials continuously at rates of up to 10–100 per second; Some types, however, are quiet and can last for one minute or more without emission of any action potential
 jaev-bhautik str par, acshan potenshial, vishesh prakaar ke voltage-gated aayan channel se parinamit hote hai
 As the membrane potential increases, the sodium ion channel opens, allowing sodium ions to enter the cell
 iske baad potacium aayan channel khulte hai jo koshika se potacium yanon ko baahar nikalne kii anumati dete hai
 The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and induces depolarization, where the capacity of the cell exceeds the resting potential of the cell
 sodium channel, acshan potenshial ke charam par band ho jate hai, jabaki potacium kaa koshika ko chhodana jari rahata he
 The depletion of potassium ions reduces the membrane potential or makes the cell hyperpolarized
 vishram se alp voltage vruddhi ke liye, potacium dhara, sodium dhara se adhik ho jaati he or voltage apane saamaanya vishram maan par laut aata he, aamtaur par -70 mv
 haalanki, agar voltage ek mahatvapurn seemaa se aage bad jaataa he, aam taur par vishram maan se 15 mv adhik, to sodium dhara haaavee ho jaati he
 This results in a spontaneous state where a positive reaction from the sodium current activates more sodium channels
 is prakaar, vah koshika ek acshan potenshial ko utpann karte hue "fire" karti he
 The currents produced by the opening of a voltage-gated channel in the order of an action potential are generally significantly larger than the initial excitatory currents
 is prakaar aayam, avadhi or acshan potenshial kaa aakaar kaaphi had tak uttejneey jhilli ke gun dwaara nirdhaarit hote hai or na ki uttejnaa ke aayam yaa avadhi dwaara
 acshan potenshial kaa yah ol-or-nathing gun use set ise kramik kshamta se alag karata he jaise receptor kshamta, electrotonic kshamta or syneptic kshamta, jo uttejnaa kii tivrata ke saath badhati he
 Different cell types and multiple types of action potentials exist in cell cells, which are determined by the type of voltage-gated channels, leak channels, channel distributions, ion concentrations, membrane capacitors, temperature, and other factors
 acshan potenshial main shaamil mukhya aayan hai sodium or potacium dhanayan; sodium aayan koshika main pravesh karte hai or potacium aayan baahar nikal jate hai or santulan bana rahata he
 For rapid changes in membrane voltage, relatively few ions need to cross the membrane
 ek acshan potenshial ke dauraan vinimay hue aayan, isliye, aantarik or bahya aayan sankendran main ek naganya badlaav karte hai
 Some ions, which actually cross, are thrown out by the continuous action of the sodium-potassium pump, which maintains a normal ratio of ion concentration across the membrane with other ion transporters
 calcium dhanayan or chloride runayan, acshan potenshial ke kuch prakaaron main shaamil hai, udhaaharan ke liye kramshah hriday sambandhi acshan potenshial or ekal koshika alga, essetabularia main acshan potenshial
 Although action potentials are generated on patches of locally excitable membranes, resulting currents can initiate action potentials on the membrane surrounding the spread, producing variances similar to dominoes
 vidyut kshamta ke niskriy prasar ke vipareet, acshan potenshial, jhilli ke uttejneey failaav ke paas nae sire se utpann hote hai or bina kshay ke failte hai
 Myelin coated segments of the axon are not excitable and do not generate action potentials and the signal is passively transmitted as an electrotonic potential
 niyamit antaraal par bina melin lepit ptch, jise nodes of ranviar kaha jaataa he, sanket ko badhaane ke liye acshan potenshial utpann karte hai
 Known as unstable conductance, this type of signal provides a favorable compromising symmetry of propagation, signal velocity, and axon diameter
 saamaanya taur par, akshatantu terminal kaa vidhruvan, syneptic cleft main neurotransmeter ke srav ko prerit karata he
 In addition, post-diffusion action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which are ubiquitous in the neocortex
 mana jaataa he ki spike-timming-dependent plasticity main inaki ek bhoomika hoti he
 Electrical signals within biological organisms are, in general, driven by ions
 acshan potenshial ke liye sabase mahatvapurn dhanayan, sodium or potacium he
 Both are monovalent cations, which carry a single positive charge
 acshan potenshial main calcium bhi shaamil ho saktaa he, jo ek dwisanyojak fatayan he jo doharaa sakaaratmak charge vahan karata he
 Chloride anion plays a large role in the action potential of some algae, but plays a negligible role in the action potential of most animals
 aayan do prabhaav ke tahat koshika jhilli ko paar karte hai: visaran or vidyut kshetra
 ek saral udhaaharan jisamen do vilay -A or B- ko ek chhidradaar baadha se alag karnaa yah vyakhya karata he ki visaran yah sunishchit karegaa ki ve antat samaan vilay main mishrit ho jaayenge
 yah mishran, unke sankendran main antar kii vajah se hota he
 The region with higher concentration will be diverted to the region with lower concentration
 To extend the example, assume that merger a has 30 sodium ions and 30 chloride ions
 iske alaava, maan lete hai ki vilay b main keval 20 sodium aayan or 20 chloride aayan hai
 Assuming that the barrier allows both types of ions to pass through, then a steady state is reached where both mergers have 25 sodium ions and 25 chloride ions
 haalanki, agar chhidradaar baadha is baat par chaynaatmak ho ki kis aayan ko guzarane diya jaae, to akele visaran, falit vilay ko nirdhaarit nahin karegaa
 Returning to the previous example, form a barrier that is permeable only by sodium ions
 chunki vilay b main sodium or chloride, donon kaa nune sankendran he, vah baadha vilay se donon yanon ko aakarshith karegi
 However, only sodium will travel through the barrier
 isse vilay b main sodium kaa ek sanchay falit hoga
 Since sodium has a positive charge, this accumulation will make merger b more positive than merger A
 Positive sodium ions will be less likely to travel to merger B, now more positive
 isse aayan pravaah ko niyantrit karne vaale duusare kaarak kaa nirmaan hota he, arthath vidyut kshetra
 vah bindu jahaan yah vidyut kshetra visaran ke kaaran bal kaa puri tarah se virodh karata he use santulan kshamta kaha jaataa he
 At this point, the net current of this specific ion is zero
 prayek neuron ek koshika jhilli main lipta hota he jo ek phospholipid bilair se bani hoti he
 This membrane is almost impermeable to ion
 yanon ko neuron ke baahar or andar antaran ke liye, jhilli do sanrachanaon ko pradaan karti he
 Ion pumps use the energy of the cell to continuously move ions in and out
 ve yanon ko apane sankendran pravanta ke khilaaf bhejkar, sankendran bhinnata kaa nirmaan karte hai 
 The ion channels then use this concentration difference to send the ions down their concentration gradient
 haalanki, aayan panpon dwaara satat parivahan ke vipareet, aayan channelon dwaara parivahan asatat he
 They open and close only in response to the signals of their surroundings
 aayan channelon ke madhyam se yanon kaa yah parivahan tab koshika jhilli ke voltage ko badalata he
 These are the changes that bring an action potential
 ek saadrishy ke rup main, aayan pump us bydaree kii bhoomika nibhaate hai jo ek radio circuit ko ek sanket sanchaarit karne ke liye anumati dete hai
 The cell membrane acts as a barrier that prevents the inside merge from being mixed with the outside merge
 in do vilyon main unke yanon kaa bhinn sankendran he
 Furthermore, this difference in concentration results in a variation in the charge of the merger
 isse ek aisi paristhiti panapati he jahaan ek vilay duusare vilay se adhik dhanatmak hota he
 Positive ions, therefore, tend to pull in the direction of negative mergers
 isi tarah, rinatmak aayan, dhanatmak vilay kii disha main khinchne lagate hai
 To measure this property, a person would somehow want to hold this relative positivity
 To do this, the out-of-phase merger is set as zero voltage
 tab andruni voltage or shunya voltage ke bich antar nirdhaarit hota he
 For example, if the external voltage is 100 mv and the inside voltage is 30 mv, the difference is -70 mv
 yahi antar he jise saamanytah jhilli kshamta ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Ion channels are integral membrane proteins that have a hole through which ions can travel between the extracellular space and the inner cell
 zyaadaatar channel ek aayan ke liye vishisht hote hai; udhaaharan ke liye, sodium kii tulana main potacium ke liye adhikansh potacium channel 1000:1 chaynaatmakataa anupaat se charitaarth hote hai, haalanki potacium or sodium yanon main ek hi charge hota he or ve keval apni trigya main thodaa bhinn hote hai
 The channel hole is usually so small that ions must pass through it in a single-file sequence
 aayan maarg ke liye channel chhidr yaa to khule yaa band ho sakate hai, haalanki kai channel, vibhinn up chaalakata str ko pradarshit karte hai
 When a channel is open, the ions penetrate down the transmembrane concentration gradient through the channel hole for that particular ion
 channel ke madhyam se aayan pravaah dar, arthath, ekal-channel vidyut aayam, adhiktam channel chaalakata or us aayan ke liye vidyut-rasinic preran bal dwaara nirdhaarit hota he, jo jhilli kshamta ke taatkaalik maan or vipareet kshamta ke maan ke bich kaa antar he
 Action potential is the manifestation of different ion channels opening and closing at different times
 ek channel kii kai vibhinn avasthaaen ho sakati hai, lekin prayek aisi avasthaa yaa to band he yaa khuli
 saamaanya rup se, band avasthaa yaa to chhidr ke ek sankuchan ke anuroop hogi - ise aayan ke liye agamya banaate hue - yaa chhidr ko rokte hue protein ke ek alag hisse ke anuroop
 udhaaharan ke liye, voltage-nirbhar sodium channel niskriyata se guzarataa he, jisamen protein kaa ek bhaag chhidr main sarak jaataa he or use band kar detaa he
 This inactivation closes the sodium block and plays an important role in the action potential
 aayan channelon ko is baat ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he ki ve apane parivesh ke khilaaf kaise pratikriya dete hai
 For example, the ion channels involved in the action potential are voltage-sensitive channels; They open and close in response to voltage across the membrane
 ligand-gated channel ek anya mahatvapurn varg kaa nirmaan karte hai; ye aayan channel ligand anu ke bandhan ke liye pratikriyaswaroop khulte or band hote hai, jaise neurotransmeter
 anya aayan channel, yantric balon ke saath khulte or band hote hai
 Still other ion channels - such as those with sensory neurons - open and close in response to other stimuli, such as light, temperature, or pressure
 acshan potenshial kii ynic dhara, sampoorn koshika jhilli main aayan ke sankendran bhinnata kii pratikriya main pravaahit hoti he
 These concentration variations are established by ion pumps, which are integral membrane proteins that conduct active transport, that is, use cellular energy to pump the ion against their concentration gradient
 aise aayan pump, yanon ko jhilli ke ek paksh se lete hai or unhen duusare paksh main chhodte hai 
 The most relevant ion pump for action potentials is the sodium-potassium pump, which excretes three sodium ions from the cell into two potassium ions
 parinamswaroop, neuron ke andar potacium yanon K+ kaa sankendran baahar ke sankendran kii tulana main mote taur par 20 guna adhik hota he, jabaki baahar kaa sodium sankendran andar kii apeksha lagbhag nau guna bada hota he
 In the same manner, other ions have different concentrations inside and outside the neuron, such as calcium, chloride, and magnesium
 aayan pump, antarkoshikeey or bahya koshikeey aayan sankendran ke saapeksh anupaat kii sthapana dwaara hi acshan potenshial kshamta prabhavit karte hai
 The action potential mainly involves the opening and closing of ion channels, not ion pumps
 agar aayan panpon ko band karne ke liye unke urja strot ko hataa diya jaae, yaa waben jaise avrodh ko jod diya jaae, to us sthiti main bhi akshatantu apane aayam ke tezi se kshay hone se pehle saikadon hazaar acshan potenshial ko fire kar saktaa he
 In particular, ion pumps do not play an important role in the re-polarization of the membrane after an action potential
 jaisaa ki unki gati ko prerit karne vaale aayan or bal khand main varnit he, ek aayan kii santulan yaa ultaav kshamta transamembrane voltage kaa vah maan he jis par aayan ke visaran gatividhi dwaara utpann vidyut bal, uske sankendran pravanta ke neeche us visaran ke aanvik bal ke baraabar ho jate hai
 The equilibrium potential for any ion can be calculated using the Nernst equation
 udhaaharan ke liye, potacium yanon ke liye paltaav kshamta nimnanusaar hoga where: bhale hi do bhinn yanon main ek hi charge he, unamem phir bhi bilkul bhinn santulan kshamta ho sakati he, basharte ki unka bahya or / yaa pradaan kii sankendran ke baahar unke or / yaa andar alag
 udhaaharan ke liye, neurons main potacium or sodium kii santulan kshamta
 potacium santulan kshamta e k, -84 mv he jahaan 5 mmol / l potacium baahar or 140 mmol / l andar he
 On the other hand, the sodium equilibrium potential e Na is approximately +40 mv where 1-2 mmol / l sodium is inside and 120 mmol / l outside
 haalanki, vahaan ek santulan jhilli kshamta e m hoti he jis par sampoorn jhilli par sabhi yanon kaa shuddh pravaah shunya hota he
 This potential is calculated by the Goldman equation
 sankshep main, yah narnst sameekaran he, is myne main ki yah sawaal vaale aayan ke charge par aadhaarit he, saath hi saath unke baahar or andar ke sankendran ke bich kii bhinnata par bhi
 haalanki, yah prashn main prayek aayan ke liye plasma jhilli kii saapeksh pargamyata par bhi vichaar karata he
 For the three most important monovalent ions of the action potential: potassium, sodium, and chloride
 ek anayan hone ke naate, chloride padon ke saath fatian padon se alag vyavhaar kiya jaataa he; andar kaa sankendran ansh he or baahar kaa sankendran har he, jo fatian shabdon se ulat he
 p i is for the permeability of the type i ion
 agar calcium yanon par bhi vichaar kiya jaae, jo mansapeshiyon main acshan potenshial ke liye mahatvapurn hai, to santulan kshamta ke liye sutara or adhik jatil ho jaataa he
 The origin of the resting membrane potential can be clearly explained by the Goldman equation
 adhikansh pashu koshikaon kii vishram plasma jhilli K+ ke prati adhik pargamya he, jo vishram kshamta v rest ko potacium santulan kshamta ke nazadik karata he
 It is important to know that the ionic and water permeability of pure lipid bipyramids is very low and it is negligible in a similar way to ions of comparable size, such as Na + k +
 haalanki, koshika jhilliyaan, badi sankhya main aayan channel, jal channel or vibhinn ynic panpon, excanger or transportron ko dhaaran karti hai jo naatakeey or chuninda rup se vibhinn yanon ke liye jhilli kii pargamyata ko badhaati hai
 Relatively high membrane permeability for potassium ion at resting potentials results from inward-modifying potassium ion channels that open at negative voltages, free modifier k + channels such as so-called leaky potassium conductances that are closed in the open state
 in potacium channelon ko voltage-sakriy K+ se bhinn samajha janaa chahie jo acshan potenshial ke dauraan jhilli punardhruvikaran ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 Many types of cells support action potentials, such as plant cells, muscle cells, and specialized cells of the heart
 haalanki, mukhya uttejneey koshika neuron he, jisamen acshan potenshial ke liye sabase aasaan tantra bhi he
 Neurons are electrically excitable cells composed of one or more dendrites of the axon more common, a single soma, a single axon, and one or more axon terminals
 dendrite, do prakaar ke sinapces main se ek he, doosraa prakaar akshatantu terminal botans he
 Dendrites constitute protrusions in response to axon terminal bottons
 in utkshepan, yaa shul ko, priseneptic neuron dwaara jari neurotransmeter par kabja karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 They have a high concentration of ligand-activated channels
 isliye yahi vah jagah he jahaan par do neurons se synapces ek duusare ke saath samvaad karte hai
 These spines have a thin neck that connects a bulbous protrusion to the main dendrite
 isse yah sunishchit hota he ki jo parivartan ridh ke andar ho rahe hai unke dwaara aas-paas kii ridh ko prabhavit karne kii kam sambhaavna he
 Hence the spine, similar to dendrites with the rare exception, acts as an independent entity
 iske baad dendrite, soma se judata he
 The soma carries the nucleus, which acts as a regulator for the neuron
 ridh ke vipareet, soma kii sataha voltage dwaara sakriy aayan channelon se vyaapt he
 These channels help transmit the signals generated by dendrites
 soma se akshatantu girika baahar nikalati he
 This region is characterized by holding an incredibly high concentration of sodium channels activated by voltage
 saamaanya rup main, acshan potenshial ke liye ise spike armbh kshetra mana jaataa he
 Multiple signals generated on the spine and transmitted by the soma, all converge here
 akshatantu girika ke turant baad akshatantu he
 It is a thin cylindrical protrusion that travels away from the soma
 yah akshatantu ek melin khol dwaara pruthak hota he
 Myelin is made up of Schwann cells that wrap themselves around the axon segment several times
 isse ek moti vasa kii parat banati he jo yanon ko akshatantu main pravesh karne yaa bhaagane se roktaa he
 This isolation performs both functions, preventing critical signal decay as well as ensuring rapid signal speed
 haalanki, is algaav main yah pratibandh he ki akshatantu kii sataha par koi bhi channel upasthit nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, there are regular spots of the membrane, with no separation
 in ranviar ke nodes ko 'laghu akshatantu girika' mana ja saktaa he kyonki unka uddeshy atyadhik sanket kshay ko rokane ke liye sanket ko badhanaa he
 At the end, the axon loses its insulation and spreads to several axon terminals
 ye akshatantu terminal tab duusare varg ke synapces, akshatantu terminal batan ke gathan ke liye samaapt hota he
 These buttons have voltage-activated calcium channels, which play a role in signaling to other neurons
 akshatantu ke aas-paas acshan potenshial kaa prasar or syneptic naub main samaapti par vichaar karne se pehle, un tareekon par vichaar karnaa laabhadaayak hota he jinke dwaara akshatantu girika par acshan potenshial ko aarambh kiya ja saktaa he
 The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage on the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing
 aise kai tareeke hai jisamen yah vidhruvan ho saktaa he
 Action potentials are most commonly initiated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials from the presynaptic neuron
 aamtaur par, tantrikasanchaarak anu, priseneptic neuron dwaara jari kiye jate hai
 These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell
 yah binding, vibhinn prakaar ke aayan channel ko kholti he
 This opening process results in a change in the local permeability of the cell membrane and results in a change in membrane potential
 yadi binding se voltage bad jaataa he to synapse uttejk hota he
 However, it is inhibitory if the bond reduces the voltage
 voltage kam ho yaa bade, yah parivartan jhilli ke aas-paas ke kshetron main niskriy rup se prasaarit hota he 
 Typically, voltage stimulation decays exponentially over time, away from synapse and binding to the neurotransmitter
 uddipan voltage kaa kuch ansh akshatantu girika tak pahunch saktaa he or jhilli kaa itnaa vidhruvan karata he ki ek nayaa acshan potenshial prerit hota he
 In general, the excitatory potential of multiple synapses must work together at the same time to induce a new action potential 
 unke sanyukt prayaas ko counter-acting nirodhatmak postsyneptic potenshial dwaara naakaam kiya ja saktaa he
 Neurotransmission can also occur through electrical synapses
 gap jankshan ke rup main ek uttejneey koshika ke bich sambandh ke kaaran, ek acshan potenshial ko ek koshika se duusari koshika main sidhe prasaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Free flow of ions between cells enables rapid non-chemical mediated transmission
 sudhaar channel yah sunishchit karte hai ki acshan potenshial ek vidyut synapse ke madhyam se ek hi disha main chalate hai
 This type of synapse is however uncommon in the human nervous system
 acshan potenshial kaa aayam, use utpann karne vaale vidyut kii raashi se swatantra hota he
 In other words, a large current does not produce a large action potential
 Therefore action potentials are called all-and-nuns, because they are either fully present or not present at all
 Instead, it is the frequency of the action potential that encodes for the intensity of a stimulus
 yah receptor potential ke vipareet he jiskaa aayam ek uddipan kii tivrata par nirbhar hota he
 Sensory neurons consist of an external signal such as pressure, temperature, light or sound with the opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn reduces the ionic permeability of the membrane and its voltage
 yah voltage parivartan phir uttejk yaa niroiumay ho saktaa he or kuch samvedi neurons main, unka sanyukt prabhaav akshatantu girika ko acshan potenshial ko prerit karne ke liye paryaapt vidhruvit kar saktaa he
 Examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and the Myssner corpuscle, which are important for sense of smell and touch, respectively
 haalanki, sabhi samvedi neurons apane bahya sanketon ko acshan potenshial main nahin badalte; kuch main yahaan tak ki akshatantu bhi nahin hota! iske bajaay, ve sanket ko ek tantrikasanchaarak ko jari karne main yaa satat vargeekrut kshamta main parivartit kar sakate hai, donon main koi bhi baad ke neuron ko ek acshan potenshial ko fire karne ke liye prerit kar saktaa he
 For example, in the human ear, hair cell molecules convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically driven ion channels, which can cause the release of neurotransmitter molecules
 aise hi samaan tareeke se, maanav retina main, praarambhik photoriceptor koshika or koshika kii agali do parat acshan potenshial kaa utpaadan nahin karti; keval kuch amecrin koshika or teesri parat, naadigranthi koshika, acshan potenshial kaa utpaadan karti he, jo optic tantrika tak yatra karti he
 In sensory neurons, action potentials result from an external stimulus
 haalanki, kuch uttejneey koshikaon ko fire karne ke liye aisi kisi prerana kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he: ve apane akshatantu girika ko swatah hi vidhruvit karte hai or ek niyamit dar se ek aantarik lock kii tarah acshan potenshial fire karte hai
 The voltage traces of such cells are known as pacemaker potentials
 hryday main seenonetrial node kii cardiyak pesamekar koshika ek acha udhaaharan pradaan karti he
 Although such a pacemaker potential has a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by an external inductor; For example, heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as by signs of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves
 External motors do not result in repetitive firing of the cell but only alter its timing
 kuch maamalon main, frequency kaa viniman adhik jatil ho saktaa he, jo acshan potenshial ke pattern ko saamne laata he, jaise barsting
 The path of the action potential can be divided into five parts: growth phase, peak phase, collapse phase, undershoot phase and finally refractory period
 The membrane potential depolarizes in the growth phase
 jis bindu par vidhruvan band ho jaataa he vah charam charan kehalaata he
 At this stage, the membrane potential is maximized
 iske baad, ek giravat kaa charan aata he
 The membrane potential is highly depolarized at this stage
 anderlaut charan vah bindu he jiske dauraan jhilli kshamta, vishram ke samay kii tulana main asthaayee rup se adhik rinatmak charge ho jaati he
 Finally, the time during which it becomes impossible or difficult to fire a subsequent action potential is called a refractory period, which may overlap with other phases
 acshan potenshial kaa path, do yugmit prabhaavon dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 Voltage-sensitive first ion channels open and close in response to changes in membrane voltage v m
 isse un yanon ke prati jhilli kii pargamyata badal jaati he
 Second, according to the Goldman equation, this change in permeability changes the equilibrium potential e m and, thus, the membrane voltage v m
 The membrane potential, thus, affects permeability, which then further affects membrane potential
 isse sakaaratmak pratikriya kii sambhaavna nirdhaarit hoti he, jo acshan potenshial ke vikaas charan kaa ek mukhya hissaa he
 a complex aspect is that a single ion channel may have multiple internal "gates" that react to changes in v m in opposite ways
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadhyapi badhata v m, voltage ke prati samvedansheel sodium channel main adhikansh get ko kholta he, vah, channel ke niskriyata get ko bhi band karata he, haalaanki thodaa dhire karata he
 Therefore, when Vm is suddenly raised, the sodium channels initially open, but then close due to slow inactivity
 acshan potenshial ke voltage or curent ko uske sabhi charnon main alan loyad hauzgin or andrew huxley dwaara 1952 main sateek rup se chitrit kiya gaya tha, jiske liye unhen 1963 main physiology yaa chikitsa main nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 However, their model only considers two types of voltage sensitive ion channels and makes several assumptions about them, such that their internal gates open and close independently of each other
 vaastaviktaa main, aayan channelon ke kai prakaar hote hai, or ve ek duusare se swatantra rup main hameshaa khulte or band nahin hote hai
 a typical action potential starts at the axon hillock with a sufficiently strong depolarization, such as an inductor that increases
 yah vidhruvan, koshika main aksar atirikt sodium katian ke injection ke kaaran paidaa hota he; ye fatayan ek vyapak kism ke sroton se aa sakate hai, jaise rasinic synapces, samvedi neuron yaa pesamekar potenshial se
 The initial membrane permeability to potassium is low, but higher than other ions, which makes the resting potential close to EK≈-75 mv
 yah vidhruvan, jhilli main sodium or potacium, donon channelon ko kholta he or yanon ko kramshah akshatantu ke andar or baahar pravaahit hone kii anumati detaa he
 If the depolarization is small, the outgoing potassium current overwhelms the incoming sodium current and the membrane depolarizes around its normal resting potential, −70 mv
 haalanki, agar vidhruvan kaaphi bada he, to aavak sodium dhara, jaavak potacium dhara se adhik ho jaati he or ek bhagoda sthiti utpann hoti he: jitna zyada aavak dhara hogi utana hi adhik v m bad jaataa he, jo badale main aavak dhara ko or adhik badha detaa he
 a sufficiently strong depolarization opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; Increasing permeability to sodium moves v m closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage e Na≈ +55 mv
 badale main badhata voltage or adhik sodium channelon ko kholta he, jo v m ko e Na kii disha main or adhik dhakelta he
 This positive reaction continues until the sodium channels are fully opened and v m is close to ena
 The sharp increase in v m and sodium permeability corresponds to the growth phase of the action potential
 is teevr haalat ke liye mahatvapurn threshold voltage aamtaur par -45 mv ke aasapaas hota he, lekin yah akshatantu kii haal kii gatividhi par nirbhar karata he
 a membrane that has just fired an action potential cannot immediately fire another, because ion channels have not returned to their normal state
 vah avadhi jiske dauraan koi nayaa acshan potenshial fire nahin kiya ja saktaa he use ebsolute rifractory piriad kaha jaataa he
 In the long run, after some ion channels are restored, the axon can be induced to produce other action potentials, but only with a very strong depolarization, eg, −30 mv
 The period during which the action potential is unusually difficult to induce is called the relative refractory period
 vikaas charan kii sakaaratmak pratikriya dhimi ho jaati he or jab sodium aayan channel adhiktam khulte hai to vah ruk jaati he
 At the peak of the action potential, sodium permeability is maximum and the membrane voltage v m is approximately equal to the sodium equilibrium voltage e Na
 haalanki, vahi vardhit voltage jisane shuru main sodium channel ko kholaa tha, vahi unke poron ko band karte hue unhen dhire-dhire band kar detaa he; sodium channel niskriy ho jate hai
 This reduces membrane permeability to sodium, which lowers the membrane voltage back
 usee samay, vardhit voltage, voltage ke prati samvedansheel potacium channel ko kholta he; jhilli kii potacium pargamyata main vruddhi v m ko e k kii ore le jaati he
 Combined, these changes in sodium and potassium permeability cause Vm to rapidly drop down and repolarize the membrane and produce the "collapse phase" of the action potential
 vardhit voltage ne saamaanya se kai adhik potacium channel khol die or inamen se kuch turant us vakt band nahin ho gaye jab jhilli apane saamaanya vishram voltage main waapas aa gai
 In addition, during the action potential, other potassium channels opened up in response to the flow of calcium ions
 jhilli kii potacium pargamyata, kshanik rup se asaamaanya rup se adhik hoti he, jo jhilli voltage v m ko potacium santulan voltage e k ke nazadik le aati he
 Therefore, there is an undershoot or hyperpolarization, in technical parlance called afterhyperpolarization, that lasts until the potassium permeability of the membrane returns to its normal value
 prayek acshan potenshial ke baad ek du:saadhy avadhi hoti he, jise ebsolute rifractory piriad, jiske dauraan ek anya acshan potenshial ko prerit karnaa asambhav hota he or relative refractory piriad, jiske dauraan ek saamaanya-se-majboot prerak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the position of sodium and potassium channel molecules
 sodium channel, jab acshan potenshial ke baad band hote hai, to ve ek "niskriy" avasthaa main pravesh karte hai, jisamen unhen jhilli potenshial ke hote hue bhi kholaa nahin ja saktaa - isse nirpeksh du:saadhy avadhi kaa janm hota he
 Even after a sufficient number of sodium channels change their resting state, it often occurs that a fraction of the potassium channels remain open, making depolarization difficult for the membrane potential and causing a relative refractory period
 
 kyonki potacium channelon kaa ghanatv or upaprakaar, bhinn prakaar ke neurons ke bich bhinn ho saktaa he, saapeksh du:saadhy avadhi ucch rup se asthir hoti he
 The absolute refractory period is largely responsible for the unidirectional propagation of the action potential around the axon
 kisi bhi samay, sakriy rup chhedit bhaag ke peeche akshatantu kaa ptch duhasaadhay he, lekin saamne kaa ptch, haal hi main sakriy nahin kiye jane ke kaaran acshan potenshial se vidhruvan se prerit hone main sakasham he
 The action potential generated on the axon hillock propagates as a wave on the axon
 ek acshan potenshial ke dauraan akshatantu par ek bindu par andar kii ore bahati dharaaen akshatantu par fail jaati hai or apane jhilli ke asann virgon ko vidhruvit kar detii hai
 If strong enough, this depolarization induces a similar action potential in neighboring membrane patches
 is buniyadi tantra ko 1937 main alan loyad haujkin dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya tha
 After crushing or cooling the nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials, they showed that the action potential reaching one side of the block could elicit another action potential on the other side, provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently small
 ek baar jhilli ke ek ptch par ek acshan potenshial ke hone par, jhilli ptch ko phir se fire karne ke liye thik hone kii jarurat hoti he
 At the molecular level, this absolute refractory period corresponds to the time it takes for the voltage-activated sodium channel to recover from inactivity, that is, to return to its closed form
 There are several types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons, many of them rapidly inactivating and some of them being slowly inactive or not inactive at all; This variability guarantees that there will always be an available source of current for repolarization, even when potassium channels are inactive due to preceding depolarization
 duusari ore, sabhi neuronal voltage-sakriy sodium channel, majboot vidhruvan ke dauraan kai milisecond ke bheetar niskriy ho jate hai, is prakaar agle vidhruvan ko asambhav bana dete hai jab tak ki sodium channel kaa ek mahatvapurn ansh apni band sthiti main waapas nahin laut aata
 haalanki, yah firing kii seemaa ko simit karata he, nirpeksh duhasaadhay avadhi yah sunishchit karti he ki acshan potenshial ek akshatantu se lage hue keval ek hi disha main chale
 ek acshan potenshial kii vajah se andar pravaahit hone vaala curent, akshatantu ke aas-paas donon dishaao main failata he
 However, only the unfired part of the axon can react with an action potential; The part that has just been fired is inactive until the action potential is safely out of range and re-ignites that part
 In normal orthodromic conduction, the action potential is transmitted from the axon hillock to the synaptic knob; Circulation in the opposite direction - known as antidromic conduction - is extremely rare
 haalanki, agar ek prayogshaala akshatantu ko iske bich main prerit kiya jaataa he to akshatantu ke donon bhaag "fresh" hote hai, arthath bina fire ke; tab do acshan potenshial utpann hote hai, jisamen se ek akshatantu girika kii ore yatra karata he or doosraa syneptic naub kii disha main yatra karata he
 The evolutionary need for rapid and effective transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system resulted in the presence of myelin sheaths around the neuronal axon
 melin ek bahu lamailer jhilli he jo akshatantu ko, nodes of renviar kahe jane vaale antaraal dwaara alag kshetron main lapetati he, vah vishesh koshikaon, shwaan koshikaon dwaara utpann hoti he, vishesh rup se paridhiy tantrika tantra main or vishesh rup se kendriya tantrika tantra main oligodandrosite dwaara
 melin shith, inter-node antaraal main jhilli kshamta ko kam kar detaa he or jhilli pratirodh ko badha detaa he or is prakaar ek node se duusare node main acshan potenshial ke ek tej, naatakeey gatividhi kii anumati detaa he
 Myelin action is mainly found in vertebrates, but in some animals without vertebrates, a conforming system has been found, as in some of the shrimp species 

 Not all neurons in vertebrates are myelinated; For example, axons of neurons in the autonomic nervous system are not normally myelinated
 melin, yanon ko melinkrut kshetron main akshatantu se jane yaa aane se bachaata he
 As a general rule, myelin increases the conduction speed of the action potential and makes them more energy efficient
 chaahe oobad-khabad ho yaa naa ho, ek acshan potenshial kii ausat chaalan gati 1 m / s se 100 m / s ke upar tak hoti he or saamaanya rup main akshatantu vyas se adhik hoti he
 Action potentials cannot propagate through the membrane to myelinated regions of the axon
 haalanki, curent ko cytoplasm dwaara le jaaya jaataa he, jo agle 1 yaa 2 node of ranviar ko vidhruvit karne ke liye paryaapt hai
 Instead, the ionic current from one action potential at one node of rainwire provokes another action potential at the next node; This apparent jump of action potentials from one node to another is called dramatic conduction
 haalanki naatakeey chaalan ke tantra ko ralf lily dwaara 1925 main sujhaayaa gaya tha, naatakeey chaalan kaa pehla prayogtmak saboot tasaki ichiji or taiji tekeuchi ne prastut kiya or andrew huxley or robert stemphli ne
 virodhabhas swaroop, bina melinkrut akshatantu main, acshan potenshial thik bagal kii jhilli main ek anya ko bhadakaata he or lagaataar ek lahar kii tarah akshatantu main neeche jaataa he
 Myelin has two important advantages: fast conduction speed and energy efficiency
 For axons larger than the minimum diameter, myelinacre typically increases the conduction velocity of the action potential tenfold
 iske vipareet, ek diye gaye chaalan veg ke liye, melinkrut fibre apane bina melinkrut samakakshon kii tulana main chote hote hai
 For example, the action potentials run roughly at the same speed in a myelinated Frog axon and in an unmyelinated giant squid axon, but the Frog axon has a diameter of about 30 times smaller and a 1000-fold smaller cross-sectional area
 iske alaava, chunki ynic curent, nodes of renviar main simit hoti hai, bahut kam yanon kaa "risaav" jhilli ke paar hota he, jisase chayapachay urja kii bachat hoti he
 This savings is an important selective advantage, as the human nervous system uses 20% of the body's metabolic energy
 akshatantu ke melinkrut segment kii lambaai, naatakeey pravaahakatva kii safalataa ke liye mahatvapurn he
 They must be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the incoming signal is so weak that it is unable to generate an action potential at the next node of rainwear
 prakruti main, melinkrut kshetra aam taur par niskriy rup se prasaarit sanket ke liye yah kaaphi hota he kam se kam do nodes ke liye yatra karte samay or paryaapt aayam banaae rakhata he taaki duusare yaa tisare node par ek acshan potenshial ko fire kiya ja sake
 Thus, the safety factor of dramatic conductance is high, which allows transmission to bypass the node in case of injury
 haalanki, acshan potenshial, kuch sthanon par samay se pehle hi samaapt ho saktaa he jahaan suraksha kaarak kam he, yahaan tak ki bina melinkrut neurons main bhi; ek saamaanya udhaaharan he, akshatantu kaa vibhaajan bindu jahaan yah do akshatantu main vibhajit hota he
 Some diseases impair myelin and dramatically impair conduction and decrease the flow velocity of the action potential
 iskaa sabase acha gyaat rup he ekaadhik kaathinya, jisamen melin kaa tuutan samanvit gatividhiyon ko bigaadta he
 The flow of currents within an axon can be described quantitatively by cable theory and by its interpretation, such as the complementary model
 The cable theory was developed by Lord Kelvin in 1855 to format transatlantic telegraph cable and was shown to be relevant to neurons in 1946 by Hodgkin and Rushton
 saadhaaran cabel siddhant main, neuron ko vidyut rup se niskriy mana jaataa he, bilkul belanaakaar sancharan cabel, jise ek aanshik antar sameekaran dwaara varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 Where V, t is the voltage across the membrane with the time and length of a neuron in the x position and where λ and τ are the characteristic lengths and times at which the voltage decays in response to the inductor
 uparokt circuit aarekh ke sandarbh main, in paimaanon ko prati unit pratirodh or sandharitra se nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 These times and lengths can be used to understand the dependence of conduction velocity on the diameter of a neuron in myelin fibers
 udhaaharan ke liye, samay paimaana τ, jhilli pratirodh r m or dharita c m, donon ke saath badhata he
 As the capacitance increases, more charge needs to be transferred to generate a given transmembrane voltage
 isi tarah ke tareeke main, yadi pratirodh prati unit aantarik lambaai r i, kisi anya kii tulana main ek akshatantu se kam he,, sthanik kshay lambaai λ lambi ho jaati he or ek acshan potenshial kaa pravaah veg badhanaa chahie
 If the transmembrane resistance rm increases, it reduces the average "leakage" across the membrane, similarly prolonging λ, which increases the flow velocity
 saamaanya rup se, jo acshan potenshial syneptic naub tak pahunchate hai ve ek tantrikasanchaarak ko syneptic cleft main sravit hone ko prerit karte hai
 Neurotransmitters are small molecules that can open ion channels in a postsynaptic cell, most axons have the same neurotransmitter at all their termini

 This complex process is inhibited by the neurotoxins tetanospasmine and botulinum toxin which are responsible for tetanus and botulism, respectively
 kuch synapces, tantrikasanchaarak "bichauliya" ko hataa dete hai or priseneptic or postsyneptic koshikaon ko jod dete hai
 When an action potential reaches such synapses, ionic currents that flow into the presynaptic cell can cross through barrier membranes and enter the postsynaptic chamber from the pore called coenxin
 is prakaar, priseneptic acshan potenshial kii kshamta kaa ynic dharaaen, sidhe postsyneptic cell ko protsaahit kar sakati hai
 Electrical synapses allow fast transmission because they do not require the slow diffusion of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft

 However, acetylene is not bound but dissociates and is hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme located in the synapse

 To prevent this control, some poisons inactivate acetylcholinesterase, such as the nerve agents sarin and tabun, and the insecticides diazinone and malathion

 This is due to the plateau, slow calcium channel that holds the equilibrium potential even after the sodium channels become inactive

 The action potential in a normal skeletal muscle cell is similar to the action potential in neurons

 The resting potential before the action potential is typically −90mv, which is somewhat more negative than typical neurons

 The action potential that is common in animal and plant action potentials is the simultaneous release of positive potassium ions, hence osmotic loss of salt, while the animal action potential is neutral on an osmotic basis, when an equal amount of incoming sodium and outgoing potassium Cancels each other on an osmotic basis
 paudhon kii koshikaon main vidyutiya or asmatik sambandh aam rup se ek choti uplabdhi asmatik kaa sanket dete hai, paudhon ke ek koshikeey purvajon main aam lavanta kii sthiti badalati he jabaki teevr sanket sanchaaran kii maujuuda kriya ko pashuon ke tahat dekha jaataa he, ek sthir metajoa paryaavaran main

 Action potentials are found in whole multicellular organisms, including plants, non-vertebrates such as insects, and vertebrates such as snakes and mammals
 Sponges appear to be the main community of multicellular eukaryotes that do not transmit action potentials, although some studies have suggested that these organisms have some form of electrical signal

 Integration of its various dendritic signals on the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of calculation, which is used to biologically central pattern generators in artificial neural networks
 acshan potenshial ke adhyayan ke liye nai prayogtmak vidhiyon ke vikaas kii aavashyaktaa he
 Early work before 1955 focused on three goals: separating signals from single neurons or axons, developing fast, sensitive electronics, and contraction of electrodes so that the voltage inside a single cell could be recorded
 pehali samasya ko squid jinas loligo ke neurons akshatantu ke adhyayan se hal kiya gaya tha
 The diameter of these axons is quite large and they can be seen with the naked eye, making them easy to remove
 haalanki, loligo akshatantu, sabhi uttejneey koshikaon ke pratinidhi nahin hai or acshan potenshial kii kai anya pranaaliyon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 The second problem was addressed with the significant development of clamp voltages, which allowed the study of ionic current inherent in the action potential separately and eliminated one main source of electronic noise, current IC that is connected to capacitor C
 chunki dharaa transamembrane voltage Vm ke badlaav ke c samay dar ke samaan hoti he, samaadhaan ek aisa circuit dizin karnaa tha jo v m ko sthir rakhe, chaahe jhilli main koi bhi dhara bah rahi ho
 Thus, the current required to keep v m constant is a direct reflection to determine the value of current flowing through the membrane
 anya electronic agrim ucch voltage input ke saath shaamil he upyog ke ucch pratibaadha vaale electronics or farade kej, isliye maap vaale voltage ko khud maapan prabhavit nahin karata
 The third problem is to obtain a small electrode that is small enough to record voltage, without disturbing it in a single axon, which was solved in 1949 with the invention of the glass micropeptide electrode, which was developed by other researchers Adopted early
 is vidhi ke shodhan ke rup main thik karne main sakasham nirmaan karne ke liye suzav he ki electrode ke tip jo 100 å hai, jo ucch pratibaadha input dete hai unka prayog kiya janaa chahie

 While the glass micropipette electrode passes through an amount to measure multiple currents through ion channels, the channel's electrical properties of a single ion were studied in 1970 by Burt Sakmann and Irwin Neher for patch clamp development

 Such inhibitors of ion channels do an important research work, but allow scientists to do by channels specific contributions, thus they can separate other channels and purify ion channels in their concentration action
 Can also be performed by or by affinity chromatography

 Neurotoxin has been an effective insecticide intended for insect ion channels, one example being the activation of sodium channels involved in synthetic permethrin action potentials

 While the Hodgkin – Huxley model may be a simplification of the realistic neural membrane as it exists in nature, its complexity has also led to many more simplified models, such as the Morris – Lacar and Fitzhuy – Nagumo models, both of which

 usee samay se ve shakti evam devi kii puja karne lage
 There is another interesting and complex mystery related to Srinagar which is related to Narada Muni and his being trapped in the web
 mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv gopeshwar main samadhisth the to unki samadhi main kaamdev dwaara vighn daalaa gaya or krodhit hokar unhone use bhasma kar diya
 After being separated from his wife Sati, all the gods were sent together by Kamdev to break the tomb of Lord Shiva, because only the son of Lord Shiva could slay the fierce demon Tarakasura
 devataaon kii ichha thi ki bhagwaan shiv phir se vivaah karen taaki ve putr kaa srijan kar saken 
 While destroying Kamdev, Lord Shiva cursed him that his gesture would not affect the ascetic in Gopeshwar
 treta yug main bhagwaan krishna ke pautra aniruddh ke rup main punarjanm lekar kaamdev kaa apni patni ke saath punarmilan hua
 Without knowing it Narada Muni completed his penance at Gopeshwar and became arrogant
 unhone bhagwaan vishnu ke saamne aatm prashansa kii to bhagwaan vishnu ne unhen paath padhaanaa chaha kyonki unhen us prishthbhumi kaa gyaan tha
 Today, the place where Srinagar is located, Lord Vishnu created a heaven-like city and persuaded his wife to conduct her own swayamvara as a beautiful woman
 naarad muni ne patni paane kaa nishchay kar kiya
 He borrowed a beautiful body from Lord Vishnu and went to the Swayamvara
 jab lakshmi ne unki ore nahin dekha to ve pareshaan hue or tab unhen bhaan hua ki bhagwaan vishnu ne unhen apane ek avatar banar kaa cheharaa de diya tha
 He became angry and cursed Lord Vishnu that just as he was deprived of marital bliss, so should Lord Vishnu when he was told about Gopeshwar and Lord Shiva, he sank in remorse and told Lord Shiva Will introduce you to my wife
 banar sena ne hi sita ko phir paane evam ravan se yuddh karne main bhagwaan ram kii sahaayta kii thi
 In the Mahabharata era, Srinagar was the capital of the kingdom of King Subahu and during the Van Parva, the Pandavas received hospitality to the Pandavas via the Gandhamardan mountain
 mahabharat kaal main, yah raja subahu ke rajya kii rajdhani thi tathaa mana jaataa he ki apane wan parv ke dauraan gandhamardan parvat ke raste pandavon ko subahu kaa aatithy mila tha
 The present name may have evolved from the Srinagar Sri Yantra which is inscribed on a huge stone whose sacrifice must have been sacrificed on the altar to please the gods
 vartmaan 8veen sadi ke dauraan hindu dharm ke punaruddhar ke kram main aadi shankaracharya ne is prakriya kaa virodh kar ise roak diya tathaa or is pathar ke chattan ko alaknanda main daal diya jo aaj bhi vahaan hai

 If, instead, the orbit is ellipse, the Sun is at a point called the "navel" of the ellipse, slightly different from its center

, Yashodharman dominated the whole of northern India, moving as the local ruler of Malwa province
 uskaa udai ulkapaat kii bhanti teevr gati se hua tha or usee kii bhanti bina adhik spasht prabhaav chode vah itihaas se lupt ho gaya
 Nothing is known about the origin and early history of Yashodharman
 uske ek abhilekh main use oulikar vansh kaa kaha gaya he
 The people of this dynasty were ruling Malwa in the middle of the fifth century as feudatories of the Gupta Empire
 kintu uske baad lagbhag sau varsho ke liye is vansh kii koi soochna nahin milti
 The power of the Guptas had waned
 vaakatakon or hunon ke akraman ke kaaran malwa kii raajnneetik dasha asthir thi
 In such a situation, it was easy for an ambitious and capable person like Yashodharman to increase his influence

 One inscription states that his dominion extended from Lohitya to the Mahendra mountain and from the Himalayas to the Western Sea
 yah vivaran paramparaagat digvijay kaa he
 In these commendations, there will be a degree of exaggeration, but such claims cannot be called absolutely baseless
 abhilekh main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki askaa adhikaar un pradeshon par bhi tha jo gupt raajaaon or hunon ke bhi adhikaar main nahin the
 The territory between Vindhya and Pariyatra was under the authority of his governor Abhayadatta which extended to the Arabian Sea
 is vistrut samrajya kii vijay ke sambandh main usne kin kin rajwanshon ko parajeet kiya, iskaa koi ullekh nahin miltaa
 In the inscription only Mihirkul's ho is named among the enemies defeated by him
 gupt naresh baladitya ne bhi mihirkul ko parajeet kiya tha
 With this incident it is difficult to keep Yashodharman's acts in chronology
 yashodharman or balditya kii vijay ek hi ghatana he, athwa yashodharman ne baladitya ke samant ke rup main hi mihirkul ko parajeet kar baad main apni swatantra satta sthapit kii, yaa mihirkul do sthanon par parajeet hua- pashchim main yashodharman or purv main baladitya ke dwaara yaa vah pehle yashordhman or uske baad baladitya ke haathon parajeet hua aadi sambhaavnaaon main se kisi ek ko nishchayatmak batalaana sambhav nahin
 According to Yuvana, even after being defeated at the hands of Baladitya, Mihirkul did not accept bowing his head and went to Kashmir and established his authority
 yadi isse mandsor abhilekh main mihirkul ke varnan kii samanta dekhi jaay to kaha ja saktaa he ki mihikul kii dwitiya paraajay yashodharman ke hi haathon hui thi
 Defeating the powerful Huns and Guptas were the major achievements of Yashodharman
 uskaa utkarsh kaal 528 i0 ke baad tha
 But his victory could not be sustained
 543 i0 main hamen yashodharman ke prabhutv kaa koi prabhaav shesh nahin miltaa
 Yet it was of his importance that he encouraged other feudal lords by his example whose growing power and refined struggle led to the disintegration of the Gupta Empire
 yashodharman kaa doosraa naam vishnuvardhan tha
 He held the title of Rajadhirajparameshwar and Samrajat
 vah shiv kaa bhakt tha
 There are many mentions of his good governance and virtues in the inscription

 Saying a social contract often implies two meanings
 prathmat: saamaajik sanvida-vishesh, jiske anusaar prakritik avasthaa main rahane vaale kuch vyaktiyon ne sangathit samaaj main pravisht hone ke liye aapas main sanvida yaa tehraav kiya, at: yah rajya kii utpatti kaa siddhant he
 Others may be called government contracts
 is sanvida yaa tehraav kaa rajya kii utpatti se koi sambandh nahin varan rajya ke astitv kii purv kalpana kar yah un manyataon kaa vivechan karata he jin par us rajya kaa shashan prabandh chale
 The discussion of social contract started later in the historical development, the logical order of both these forms of contract
 parantu jab sanvida ke aadhaar par hi samast raajnneeti shaastra kaa vivechan prarambh hua tab in donon prakaar kii sanvidaaon kaa prayog kiya jane laga - saamaajik sanvida kaa rajya kii utpatti ke liye tathaa sarkari sanvida kaa uski sarkaar ko niyamit karne ke liye
 Although the principle of social contract is found in its sprout form in Socrates' ideas, Sophist political philosophy and Roman legislation, and Mangold linked it to the principle of public rights, its first detailed discussion was found in medieval political philosophy as government contract
 is
 sarkaar ke aadhaar ke rup main sanvida kaa yah siddhant ban gaya
 This idea was not only in favor of medieval feudal society but also in favor of medieval Christian monks because it was helpful in setting the boundaries of state power
 16veen shatabdi ke dharmik sangharsh ke yug main bhi yah siddhant bahusnkhyakon ke dharm ko aropit karne vaali sarkaar ke prati alpsankhyakon ke virodh ke auchity kaa aadhaar bana
 As such it served the purposes of both Calvinism and Romanism minorities
 parantu kalantar main sarkari sanvida ke sthaan par saamaajik sanvida ko hi hobbs, lock or ruso dwaara prashray praapt hua
 Obviously a government contract cannot be discussed without believing in a social contract, but a social contract is definitely possible without trusting a government contract
 saamaajik sanvida dwaara nirmit samaaj shaasha or shasit ke bich antar kiye bina or isiilie unke bich ek anya sanvida kii sambhaavna ke bina bhi, swaittshasit ho saktaa he
 This was the principle of Russo
 duusare, saamaajik sanvida par nirmit samaaj sangrakshan ke rup main kisi sarkaar kii niyukti kar saktaa he jisase yadhyapi vah koi sanvida nahin karata tathaapi sangrakshak ke niyamon ke ulanghan par use chyut kar saktaa he
 This was Locke's theory
 ant main ek baar saamaajik sanvida par nirmit ho jane par samaaj apane sabhi adhikaar or shaktiyaan kisi sarvasattadhari samprabhu ko saunp saktaa he jo samaaj se koi sanvida nahin karata or isiilie kisi sarkari sanvida kii simaaon ke antargat nahin he
 This was Hobbes's theory
 sambhavtah bharat main hi parakramee raja tathaa saamaajik sanvida kaa mahatv sabase pehle samajha gaya
 The views expressed in Manusmriti, Shantiparva of Mahabharata and Arthashastra of Chanakya support the social contract
 mahabharat main bhishma kehete hai- Expressing the importance of social contract, Bhishma further says that we have heard that in the past, chaotic subjects devoured each other like big fish in water
 bhishma aage kehete hai- But Bhishma says that 'a man who wants wealth should want to worship the king in the same way that Indra is worshiped
 raja ko 'daivi' mana jaataa tha
 Similar thoughts have come in Dighnikaya
 saamaajik sanvida ke siddhant par aghat yadhyapi hegel ke samay se hi prarambh ho gaya tha tathaapi david hum dwaara ise sarvapratham sarvaadhik kshati pahaunchi
 According to Hume, government is founded not on consent, but on practice and thus as the basis of political gratitude and Burke criticizes the contract on the basis of evolutionary theory
 saamaajik sanvida kaa siddhant na keval aitihaasikta kii drushti se apramanit he varan vaidhanik tathaa darshanik drushti se bhi doshapurn he
 For a contract to be valid, it must have the patronage and support of the state; There is no mention of any such power behind social contract
 isliye yah avaidhanik he
 Secondly, the rules of contract are imposed only on the contractors, not on their offspring
 saamaajik sanvida ke siddhant kaa darshanik aadhaar bhi trutipurna he
 The notion that the relation of the individual and the state is based on individual independent determination is not true
 rajya na to kritrim sristi he or na isaki sadsyta aichhik he, kyonki vyakti icchaanusaar isaki sadsyta na to praapt kar saktaa he or na to tyaag hi saktaa he
 Secondly, it divides human history into two stages, natural and social; There is no logical basis for such division; Today's civilization is considered as natural as it was in the early period
 tisare, yah siddhant is baat kii purv kalpana karata he ki prakritik avasthaa main rahane vaala manushya sanvida ke vichaar se avgat tha parantu saamaajik avasthaa main na rahane vaale ke liye saamaajik uttardaayitv kii kalpana karnaa sambhav nahin
 If a natural state governed by natural legislation is accepted, then in such a situation, the establishment of the state will not reflect progress, but it will be reflective of retrograde, because instead of natural legislation, it would be regressive to adopt state power based on force
 yadi prakritik avasthaa aisi thi ki vah sanvida kaa vichaar pradaan kar sake to yah maananaa padegaa ki manushya tab bhi saamaanya hit ke prati sachet tha; is drushti se use saamaajik satta tathaa vaiyaktik adhikaar ke prati bhi sachet hona chahie
 And then there is no difference between natural and social conditions
 ant main, jaisaa green ne kaha, is siddhant kii pramukh truti iskaa anaitihaasik hona nahin varan yah he ki isamen aadhaar kii kalpana unhen samaaj se asambaddha karke kii gai he
 The basis of rights in a logical manner is the consent of society; Rights are possible only among those whose tendencies and desires are intellectual
 atev prakritik adhikaar adhikaar na hokar maatr shaktiyaan hai
 But despite all these errors, the principle of social contract is a strong basis for providing stability to the government
 yah siddhant is vichaar ko pratishthapit karata he ki rajya kaa aadhaar bal nahin vikalp he kyonki sarkaar janasahmati par aadhaarit he
 From this point of view, this principle is one of the cornerstones of democracy
 tark kii jis prakriya main ek yaa adhik gyaat saamaanya kathanon ke aadhaar par kisi nishchit nishkarsh par pahunchaa jaataa he, nigamanaatmak tark kehete hai

 There are three tehsils in Ketch district: vidyutchumbakeey varnakram main un sari aavritiyon ke vikiran aate hai jo sambhav hai
 The electromagnetic spectrum of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiations from that object, or often just the spectrum
 vidyutchumbakeey varnakram nimna aavritiyon, jo ki nutan radio main prayog hotin hai, se lekar gamma vikiran tak hota he, jo ki sahasron kilometre kii tarangadairghy se lekar ek anu ke naap ke ek ansh ke baraabar tak kii sari aavritiyon ko liye hota he
 The short wavelength in our universe is limited to around Planck distance; And the long wavelength is limited to the size of the universe
 vaise varnakram ko aseemit evam aviraam hi kehete hai
 Different units of wavelength are generally used for convenience in different departments of the spectrum
 radio prasaaran main 1 meter ko ekak mana jaataa he, tathaa radio ke sookshm tarang vibhaag main ek millimetre ko ekak mana jaataa he
 10-4 cm for infrared spectrum Unit is prevalent and for visible light even smaller than 10-8 cm

 sadak main gati seemaa kaa upyog adhiktam deshon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Every road has a standard set according to its condition
 isamen gati seemaa pramukh he
 Its standard also varies by location
 saamanytah gati seemaa ke sthaan par anya yatayaat chinh hone hai
 In some places there is no speed limit
 jahaan koi bhi kitni bhi gati se vaahan chalaa saktaa he
 The maximum speed limit was first used in England in the year 1861
 tab uski gati 16 kimi rakhi gai thi
 The speed limit for sending some of the highest speeds in the world is 140 km
 england ne pratham ankiy gati seemaa kaa nirmaan kiya or uske liye dhara 1861, 1865 or 1878 kaa nirmaan kiya
 In this, the speed limit under section 1896 will be 16 km on the open road of any city

 In the context of business and organization, management means - to coordinate the work of people by utilizing the available resources efficiently and effectively so as to ensure the achievement of goals
 prabandhan ke antargat aayojan, sanghathan-nirmaan, staffing, netritv karnaa, tathaa sanghathan athwa pahal kaa niyantran karnaa aadi aate hai
 Regardless of whether the organization is large or small, for profit or non-profit, providing services or manufacturing, management is essential for everyone
 prabandh isliye aavashyak he ki vyakti samuhik uddeshyon kii purti main apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Management involves mutually related tasks that all managers perform
 prabandhak alag-alag kaaryon par bhinn samay lagaate hai
 Managers at the higher levels of the organization spend more time on planning and organization than managers at the bottom
 kai lekhakon ne prabandh kii paribhaasha di he
 The word manga is a plural term widely used for all kinds of verbs
 vaise yah kisi bhi udhyam kii vibhinn kriyaaon ke liye mukhya rup se prayukt hua he
 From the above example and the study of the situation, it must have become clear that management is the action which is necessary in every organization in which people are working as a group
 sanghathan main log alag-alag prakaar ke kaary karte hai lekin vah abhi samaan uddeshy ko paane ke liye kaary karte hai
 Management provides direction in people's efforts and achieving the same objective
 is prakaar se prabandh yah dekhtaa he ki kaary puure hon evam lakshya praapt kiye jaaen kam-se-kam saadhan evam nunatam laagat par ho
 Hence, management can be defined as the process of completing tasks with the aim of achieving the objectives effectively and efficiently
 hame is paribhaasha ke vishleshan kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are some words that need to be described in detail
 ye shabd hai- The process used in the definition refers to the primary task or actions that the management performs to complete the tasks
 ye kaary hai- niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan evam niyantran jin par charchaa is adhyay main evam pustak main aage kii jaaegi
 Effective or actually doing the job effectively means actually completing the given task
 prabhavi prabandh kaa sambandh sahi kaary ko karne, kriyaaon ko puraa karne evam uddeshyon ko praapt karne se he
 In other words, its function is to get the final result
 lekin maatr kaary ko sampann karnaa hi paryaapt nahin he iskaa ek or pahalu bhi he or vah he kaarykushalta arthath kaary ko kushaltapurvak karnaa
 Efficiency means doing the job correctly at minimum cost
 isamen ek prakaar kaa laagat-laabh vishleshan evam aagat tathaa nirgat ke bich sambandh hota he
 If we gain more by using less means then we will say that there is an increase in capacity
 kshamta main vruddhi hogi yadi usee laabh ke liye athwa nirgat ke liye kam sadhano kaa upyog kiya jaataa he evam kam laagat vyay kii jaati he
 Input means are those which have the money, goods, equipment and human resources required to do a particular task
 swabhaavik he ki prabandh kaa sambandh in sansadhano ke kushal prayog se he kyonki inase laagat kam hoti he evam ant main inase laabh main vruddhi hoti he
 These two words are related to each other despite being different
 prabandh ke liye prabhavi evam kshamtawan donon kaa hona mahatvapurn he
 Both effectiveness and skill are two sides of the same coin
 lekin in donon pakshon main santulan aavashyak he tathaa kabhi-kabhi prabandh ko kushalta se samjhauta karnaa hota he
 For example it is easy to be effective and ignore efficiency which means completing the work but at a high cost
 udhaaharan ke liye, mana ek company kaa lakshya varsh main 8,000 ikaayiyon kaa utpaadan karnaa he
 To achieve this goal most of the time, the manager was not effective when the electricity was not available, but not efficient because more inputs were used for the same output
 kabhi-kabhi vyavsaay kam sansadhano se maal ke utpaadan par adhik dhyaan kendrit karata he arthath laagat to kam kar di lekin nirdhaarit utpaadan nahin kar paae
 As a result, the goods could not reach the market, hence its demand was reduced and it was replaced by the competitors
 yah kaarykushalta lekin prabhaavapurntaa kii kami kii sthiti he kyonki maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya
 Therefore, it is more important for the manager to achieve the goals at the lowest cost
 iske liye prabhaavapurntaa evam kushalta main santulan rakhana hota he
 Generally high work efficiency is accompanied by high effectiveness which is the goal of all managers
 lekin bagaiyr prabhaavapurntaa ke ucch kaary kushalta par anaavashyak rup se jor dena bhi avaanchhneeya he
 Weak management is due to lack of both effectiveness and efficiency
 kuch paribhaashaon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat hamen kuch tatwon kaa pataa lagata he jinhen ham prabandh kii aadharbhoot visheshtaayen kehete hai
 Management serves to fulfill certain objectives
 uddeshy kisi bhi kriya ke apekshit parinaam hote hai
 These should be derived from the basic purpose of the business
 kisi bhi sanghathan ke bhinn-bhinn uddeshy hote hai tathaa prabandh ko in sabhi uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se paanaa hota he
 Objectives can be classified into organizational objectives, social objectives and personal objectives
