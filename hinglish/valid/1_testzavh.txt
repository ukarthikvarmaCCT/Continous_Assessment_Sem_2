 The credit for starting the Green Revolution goes to Nobel Laureate Professor Narman Borlaug
 harith kranti se abhipraay desh ke sinchit evam acinchit krishi kshetron main adhik upaj dene vaale sankar tathaa boune bijon ke upyog se fasal utpaadan main vruddhi karnaa hai
 The Green Revolution is the result of the development method implemented in Indian agriculture, which emerged in the 1960s as traditional agriculture was replaced by modern technology
 kyonki krishi kshetra main yah takniki ekaek ai, teji se iskaa vikaas hua or thode hi samay main isse itane ascharyajanak parinaam nikle ki desh ke yojanakaaron, krishi visheshgyon tathaa raajnneetigyon ne is apratyaashit pragati ko hi 'harith kranti' kii sangya pradaan kar di
 The name of Green Revolution was also given because, as a result, Indian agriculture had risen above the subsistence level to a higher level
 uplabdhiyaan The Green Revolution resulted in significant progress in the agricultural sector of the country
 krishi aagton main hue gunatmak sudhaar ke falswaroop desh main krishi utpaadan badha he
 Self-sufficiency has come in food grains
 vyavsaayik krishi ko badhaava mila he
 The attitude of farmers has changed
 krishi aadhiky main vruddhi hui he
 As a result of the Green Revolution, there has been a substantial increase in the production and total productivity per hectare against crops like wheat, sugarcane, maize and millet
 harith kranti kii uplabdhiyon ko krishi main takniki evam sansthagat parivartan evam utpaadan main hue sudhaar ke rup main nimnavat dekha ja saktaa he- krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudharracinic urvarkon kaa prayog As a result of the new agricultural policy, the amount of consumption of chemical fertilizers has increased rapidly

69 lakh quintal base seeds were produced and 190 lakh certified seeds were distributed
 sinchai suvidhaon kaa vikaas Under the new development method, irrigation facilities have been expanded rapidly in the country
 1951 main desh main kul sinchai kshamta 223 lakh hectares thi, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 1,073 lakh hectares ho gai
 The total accumulated area in the country in 1951 was 210 lakh hectare, which increased to 673 lakh hectare in 2008-2009
 paudh sangrakshan Under the new agricultural development method, attention is also being paid to plant protection
 iske antargat kharpatvaar evam kiton kaa naash karne ke liye dawa chhidakane kaa kaary kiya jaataa he tathaa tiddi dal par niyantran karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 Presently, eco-friendly worm control program has been implemented under Integrated Agriculture Management
 bahufasali kaarykram The purpose of the multi-crop program is to increase production by growing more than one crop in a year on the same land
 anya shabdon main bhoomi kii urvartaa shakti ko nasht kiye bina, bhoomi ke ek ikai kshetra se adhiktam utpaadan praapt karnaa hi bahufasali kaarykram kehalaata he
 In 1966-1967, multi-cropping program was implemented in 36 lakh hectares of land
 vartmaan samay main bharat kii kul sanchit bhoomi ke 71 pratishat bhaag par yah kaarykram lagu he
 Use of modern agricultural implements nai krishi vikaas vidhi evam harith kranti main aadhunik krishi upkarnon, jaise- tractor, thresar, harvester, bulldozer tathaa dijal evam bijli ke pumpaseton aadi ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Thus, the substitution of manpower and manpower in agriculture has been done by operating power, which has increased the utilization and productivity of the agricultural sector
 krishi seva kendron kii sthapana a plan has been implemented to set up agricultural service centers in the country with the objective of developing the ability of business courage among farmers

 This program is increasingly applicable in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh
 krishi shiksha evam anusandhan The first agricultural university has been established in Pantnagar to expand agricultural education under the government's agricultural policy
 aaj krishi or isse sambandhit kshetron main ucch shiksha ke liye 4 krishi vishvavidhyalay, 39 rajya krishi vishvavidhyalay or imphal main ek kendriya vishvavidhyalay he
 There is 'indian Council of Agricultural Research' for agricultural research, under which there are 53 Central Institutes, 32 National Research Centers, 12 Projects, 64 All India Coordinated Research Projects
 iske atirikt desh main 527 krishi vigyaan kendra hai, jo shikshan evam prashikshan kaa kaary kar rahe hai
 To maintain the quality of agricultural education and training, computerization and internet facilities of various institutions have been provided
 krishi utpaadan main sudharutpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi The biggest advantage of the Green Revolution or the new development method implemented in Indian agriculture was that the area of crops in the country increased, agricultural production and productivity increased
 visheshkar gehun, bajra, dhan, makka tathaa jowar ke utpaadan main aashaatheet vruddhi hui
 As a result, India became self-sufficient in food grains
 1951-1952 main desh main khadyannon kaa kul utpaadan 5
09 karod ton tha, jo kramshah badhkar 2008-2009 main badhkar 23
38 karod ton ho gaya
 Similarly there has been a substantial improvement in productivity per hectare
 varsh 1950-1951 main khadyannon kaa utpaadan 522 kigra prati hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 1,893 kigra prati hectares ho gaya
 Yes, there has also been some exaggeration in food grains production in India due to bad weather etc
 which proves that agricultural production in the country still depends on the weather
 krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan As a result of the Green Revolution, the traditional form of farming has changed and farming has started to be done commercially
 jabaki pehle sirf pet bharne ke liye kii jaati thi
 There has been an increase in the production of sugarcane, cotton, jute and oilseeds in the country
 kapaas kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 5
6 million ganth tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 27 million ganth ho gaya
 Similarly, the production of oilseeds was 7 million tonnes in 1960–1961, which increased to 28
2 million tonnes in 2008–2009
 isi tarah patson, ganna, aalu tathaa moongfalee aadi vyavsaayik fasalon ke utpaadan main bhi vruddhi hui he
 At present, cultivation of horticultural crops, fruits, vegetables and flowers is also being encouraged in the country
 krishi bachaton main vruddhi Production has increased through the use of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, good irrigation and machines
 jisase krishakon ke paas bachaton kii ullekhneey maatra main vruddhi hui he
 Which can be used in the development work of the country
 agragami tathaa pratigaami sambandhon main majbootee New technology and modernization of agriculture have made the relationship between agriculture and industry stronger
 parmparik rup main yadhyapi krishi or udyog kaa agragami sambandh pehle se hi pragadh tha, kyonki krishi kshetra dwaara udyogon ko anek aagat uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 But the regressive relationship between these two was very weak, because the manufactured goods of the industry were rarely used in agriculture
 parantu krishi ke aadhunikaran ke falswaroop ab krishi main udyog nirmit aagton, jaise- krishi yantra evam rasinic urvarak aadi, kii maang main baari vruddhi hui he, jisase krishi kaa pratigaami sambandh bhi sudrudh hua he
 In other words, the relationship between agriculture and industrial sector has become stronger
 is tarah spasht he ki harith kranti ke falswaroop desh main krishi aagton evam utpaadan main paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 As a result, farmers, government and public have become convinced that India can not only become self-sufficient in the field of agricultural produce, but can also export
 vishleshan There has been substantial development in the field of agriculture in the planning period in the country
 kul krishi kshetra badha he, fasal ke swaroop main parivartan hua he, sinchit kshetra badha he, rasinic khaadon ke upyog main vruddhi hui he tathaa aadhunik krishi yantron kaa upyog hone laga he
 Despite all these things, the development of agriculture in the country has not yet reached the proper level, because the agricultural production per hectare is less than other developed countries
 abhi anek krishi utpaadon kaa aayaat karnaa padhata he
 Because their production is less than the demand
 krishi kshetra kaa abhi bhi ek badha bhaag acinchit he
 The level of mechanization in agriculture is still low, leading to higher production costs

 Therefore, there is a need for further development of the agricultural sector by implementing technical and institutional reforms in agriculture more effectively

 kamiyaan tathaa samasyaayen As a result of the Green Revolution in the country, there has been a substantial increase in the production of some crops, there has been a decrease in the import of food grains, there has been a change in the traditional form of agriculture, yet some shortcomings are reflected in this program
 harith kranti kii pramukh kamiyon evam samansyaon ko nimna rup main pranstut kiya ja saktaa he- Impact - The impact of the Green Revolution was limited to certain crops, such as wheat, jowar, millet
 anya fasalo par iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Even rice has been affected very little by this
 vyapaarik fasalen bhi isse aprabhavit hi hai
 Promotion of capitalist agriculture - Seeds of more fertile variety are a capital-intensive program, in which large amounts have to be invested on inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation, agricultural implements etc
 baari nivesh karnaa chote tathaa madhyam shrenee ke kisaanon kii kshamta se baahar hai
 In this way, those farmers who have private pumping sets, tractors, tube wells and other agricultural machines are benefiting from the Green Revolution
 yah suvidha desh ke bade kisaanon ko hi uplabdh he
 Ordinary farmers are deprived of these facilities
 sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa par bal nahin - nai vikaas vidhi main sansthagat sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa kii sarvatha avhelnaa kii gayi he
 Under institutional changes, the most important component is the system of land holding

 According to V
 Rao, "it is now well known that inequality in rural income has increased with the so-called Green Revolution, which has helped to increase the production of food grains in the country, many small farmers have to give up their tenancy rights and Social and economic tensions have increased in rural areas
 " Lack of necessary facilities - Due to lack of facilities necessary for the success of Green Revolution, such as irrigation system, agricultural credit, economic holdings and cheap inputs etc
, the desired success in the field of agricultural development is not being achieved
 kshetreey asantulan - harith kranti kaa prabhaav punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, maharashtra tathaa tamilnadu aadi rajyon tak hi simit he
 Due to its effect not spreading on the whole country, the country could not develop in a balanced manner
 is tarah, harith kranti simit rup se hi safal rahi he
 Tips for the success of Green Revolution sansthagat parivartanon ko protsaahan - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko prabhavi or vistrut rup se lagu kiya janaa chahie

 Increase in employment opportunities - Labor intensive techniques should be adopted and cottage and village industries should be expanded rapidly to solve the problem of unemployment in rural areas
 sinchai ke sadhano kaa vikaas - desh main sinchai kii suvidhaon kaa paryaapt vikaas kiya janaa chahie, taaki krishak adhik upaj dene vaali kismon kaa puraa laabh uthaa saken
 In this context, attention should be paid to the expansion of minor irrigation projects
 anya sanrachanaatmak sudhaaron kaa vistaar - krishi ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak bijli, parivahan sahit anya sanrachanaatmak suvidhaon kaa vikaas kiya janaa chahie
 Only then will the Green Revolution spread to other crops and regions
 harith kranti kaa anya fasalon tak failaav - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki iskaa vistaar chaaval tathaa anya fasalon kii kheti tak kiya jaye
 Production growth in respect of commercial crops like pulses, cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, jute, etc
 has also not been satisfactory with rice
 atah in fasalon ko bhi harith kranti ke prabhaav kshetra main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Connecting small farms and small farmers - Small farms and small farmers should also be associated with green revolution
 iske liye aavashyak he ki- bhoomi sudhaar kaaryakramon ko shighrata or prabhavi dhang se lagu kiya janaa chahie, chote-chote kisaanon ko unnat beej, khaad aadi aavashyak chizon ko kareedne ke liye udaar sharton evam daron par saakh suvidhaayen uplabdh karaayi jaani chahie, saadhaaran krishi upkarnon kii kareed ke sambandh main di gayi suvidhaon ke atirikt badi-badi farm mashinari yatha-tractor, harvester aadi ko sarkaar kii ore se kiraye par diya janaa chahie, bahut choti-choti joton vaale kisaanon ko sahakaari kheti ko apnaane ke liye prerit kiya janaa chahie

 Be available on time
 iske atirikt sarkaar ko samast krishi upajon kii bikri kaa prabandh kiya janaa chahie tathaa uchit mulya par krishi utpaadon ko kareedne kii garanti bhi deni chahie

 Akhand Saubhagyavati is a 1963 Hindi language film
 bhudrishy vaastukala sthal ko maanav upyog or aamod ke liye suvyasthit karne or upyukt banane kii srujanaatmak kala he
 Its purpose is to greatly influence the human mind and satisfy the emotional motivations associated with the site or structure, as a result of the overall configuration, so that people are highly praised
 iske atirikt bhudrishy vastukala ke antargat bhudrishy ejiniyari, bhudrishy udyankarm or bhaleebhanti aakalpit chitra vicitra park bhi bhudrishy vaastukala main sammilit hai
 In landscape construction, there is very little work of convenience, though the usefulness of plantation includes stopping the wind, providing solitude, increasing the importance and bringing color, etc
 aakalpan kaa uddeshy mahanata, sundarataa or vividhta se purna drishyon ke dwaara chittkarshak paryaavaran nirmaan karnaa he
 Its accomplishment is done by artificial or natural design, according to the location, structure, condition, vegetation and climate, by creating consistency or opposition
 iske atirikt yah kahana aavashyak he ki is srujanaatmak shakha ke vyaavhaarik paksh kaa aadhaar yah manyata he ki upyogita or sundarataa paraspar sangat or inamen se koi bhi duusare ke bina purna nahin he
 Landscape architecture may be the apt name for the designs that make the site scene widely practicable, as in Le Nottre's unique gardens in Varsai, Jahangir in Lahore's exquisitely designed Dilkhush Bagh and Kashmir's world-famous panoramic Shalimar Bagh, and Shah Jahan Had done in the solemn setting and charming surroundings of the Taj Mahal, or the Japanese gardener in the bizarre dreams of his love Do in a fun and enjoyable environment, or as in the present day Vrindavan Gardens in Mysore, in a panoramic setting in the swanky public garden in Bombay, where the surface of a large reservoir built for a part of the city is used And in the Golden Jubilee Garden of Tatanagar which is a resting place in a very busy industrial city to lighten the labor load of the workers working in the factory

 Along with this, ornamental trees, flower leaves, waterfalls and springs, sprinklers, sculptures, spectator pavilions, benches and floor material with varied patterns and colors have been used
 paryaavaran ke maanvikaran ke liye saare ke saare nagar main hi sthaldrishy nirmaan kii vyavastha honi chahie
 This is evident from the Codi examples in historical developments ranging from Babylonian to Varsai in the West and from Ashoka period to Mughal gardens in India, which had an abundance of specimens of artificial or equidistant configurations
 audyogic kranti kaal main kuch samay tak sthaldrishy nirmaan kaa mahatv bhuulaa rahaa, kintu maanav mastishk or swasthya par yantrayug kaa pratikul prabhaav hone ke kaaran udyaan nagaron, nagar saundarya or harith peti yukt nagariyon kaa shaktishaalee andolan aarambh hua, jisamen china kii khuli udyaan style kaa samavesh hua
 In this way, a suitable environment was created for the proper construction of the scene in and around the city

 For the creation of a suitable place, it is first necessary to consider some of the fundamental elements of city planning such as roads and streets, squares, squares etc
, minor elements related to buildings, shops, lighthouses, telephone brackets and signposts etc
 Horizontal and vertical views of cities and buildings should be given due consideration
 inke atirikt sthalavinyas kaa safal aakalp chaar baton par nirbhar he : samaavaran, anurupata yaa pratikulata, vismay or jal kaa upyog
 All these together with the original and minor elements provide the appropriate basis for such excellent landscape design, in which a constantly changing scene has to be preconceived
 padap saamagree ke upyog ke vishay main yah aavashyak he ki nagar, uske pados or paryaavaran ke liye saundarya evam upyogita se purna abhikalp taiyaar kiya jaae
 For this purpose a plantation plan should be made
 is sambandh main maarg-parshv-vrikshavali kaa mukhya prayojan chaaya pradaan karnaa tathaa vithi drishy ko susajjit karnaa he
 For this, an attractive tapestry of colorful flowers should be maintained throughout the year
 By applying dark yellow amalatus with the contrast of the flowers of Sinduri gulmohar, the beautiful tree can be prepared and the blue flowers of the Jacaranda mimacifolia will also make the scene more beautiful
 is
 nivaskshetron ke aas paas sajaavati phulonvale vriksh lagaana upyukt he, jaise kadamb, maulashree, kachnaar, kupikurch, sheer chanpak, parijaat, sita, ashok or majun
 To make the park beautiful throughout the year, cana, ornamental ignora, indigo painter and perennial ginia are more suitable than seasonal flowers blooming for two months
 inke saath saath naarangi rang ke dilli gulab or abhisundara lataayen laga dene se varsh bhar sundar laganevaala adbhut vinyas taiyaar hota he, jisaki anurakshan laagat bahut kam hoti he
 Seasonal flowers can be further enhanced in the configuration

 As far as habitats are concerned, three horticultural distinctions can be made: fruit-garden-garden, flower-garden and picturesque gardening
 bagwani ke tisare prakaar kaa uddeshy shobhaa, saundarya yaa vividhta purna drishyon se kalpana ko santusht karnaa he
 The ancient opinion in this regard was that there should be a garden around the house, so that there would be a definite separation in nature and structure
 yah vibhaajan atyant anamy tha or jalwaayu ke anusaar keval itnaa hi vikalp tha ki chaahe koi chat ke neeche deevaaron se ghira rahe or chaahe khule udyaan main prakruti ke bich rahe
 Instead, the gardens built in the depths of China and Japan are good in that they have a view as well as an inclination, which gives solitude and enjoyment
 kintu aadhunik pravriti bagichaa bheetar laane kii he, jisase bheetar or baahar ke bich vibhaajan kii yojana ke sabhi puraane prayaason se utkrisht he, kyonki isse ghar ke bheetar rahen yaa baahar, prakruti kii upasthiti ke kaaran anand, ullas or shant manobhaav avichhinn rahete hai
 In this type of plan, plants like the Queen of the Night, Rukmini, Harsingar should be kept from where the wind comes, so that the aroma can be reached in the building
 bheetar kii ore mani padap, shatavari aadi, aise hi paudhon ke gamale darshanatosh ke liye lagaae ja sakate hai
 But landscape architecture has a special inclination towards gardening, which is the fundamental science of all emergent materials, and the inherent parts of landscape-building that satisfy human emotional cravings in specific types of environment, along with natural shapes
 Are dependent on horticultural skills
 vahaan ghoomane phiranevaale prayek vyakti ke or udhar janevaali prayek aankh ke, saamne vividh drishyon kii shrikhala pradarshit karanevaala ek chitrapatal sa khul jaataa he
 In this way, the value of the approach, scene and location of the place increases by finding a place of exploration and amazement
 jab kabhi maanavkrut or prakritik ghatak krishya kshetron yaa aadyogit kendron ke nikat chaturata ke saath jamaa die jate hai, tab yah maan liya jaataa he ki vah prakruti se mail khaataa hoga
 These efforts bring nature back to the cities in the form of pure air, sunshine, water, greenery, breeze and energizing gardens and parks

 chibers main kuch takiya kalam the, jaise norm ke sharabakhaane main upasthit hote hi uskaa abhivadan ek tej dhwani "norm!" ke saath hota he
 Initial episodes usually featured Sam's antics with various women and then repeated several romantic comedies to get out of whatever relationship he had problems with per episode
 jaise-jaise kaarykram aage badhata he or sam kai gambhir rishton main bandhata he, aam swar kamedi main tabadil ho jaataa he or sam ek-patni jivan style main apane aap ko sthapit karata he
 Throughout the series, a large story block is developed that spans over several episodes, or a short theme and an episode of episodes that is unique, spanning seasons
 kaarykram ke shuruaati sizan kaa mukhya vishay bauddhik vetres diana chembers or baar ke maalik sam melone ke bich romance hota he, sam bostone red sokes kaa purv pramukh lig besabaal pichar hota he or sharaab kii lat se apane ko kaabo karne kii prakriya main hota he
 After a long stint in the program, Sam's new relationship with neurotic corporate climber Rebecca was focused on
 donon hi rishton main kai kadiyon tak "karenge yaa nahin karenge" vaala yon tanaav vyaapt tha jisane darshakon ko aakarshith kiya
 However, many of Cheers' scripts humorously center around or relate to a variety of social issues
 jaisaa ki toasting chibers kahata he, "sharaab kii lat, samalangikta or vyabhichaar jaise vivaadaaspad muddon ko lekhak ke safaltaapurvak sajaane main spashtataa ke dwaara patakatha ko or bhi majbooti di gai he
 " saamaajik varg kaarykram kaa ek pahalu tha

 iskaa ek charam udhaaharan woodi boid or karodpati kii beti keli gens ke bich sambanth tha

 unke rishte ke chalate diana, sam kii svachhndatha par kai akshep lagaati he, jabaki karla keval logon kaa apmaan karti he
 Carla was respected because of her tough attitude, intelligence, and power, while Dianna was often ignored because she rarely held any respect in a successful way
 rebeka ek parmparik mahatvakankshi vyavsaayee or purushon se paisa jhatakane vaali mahila thi or lilian corporation main diggajon se rishte banane kii koshish karti he, jisamen sabase ullekhneey evan drek tha, usase vah padonnati or aage badhane ke liye rishta banaati he
 However, she encounters glass sealing and at the end of the program marries a plumber rather than a rich businessman

 lilyth, kai digriyon or puraskaron ko praapt karne vaali ek oonche darje kii manochikitsak thi or apane majboot or thode karkash aacharan ke kaaran sammaan praapt karti thi
 Like Rebecca, she was a working woman of the 1980s with a strong emphasis on her professional life
 uske or frezier ke rishte main uskaa zyada haath hone ke liye aksar uskaa chithran kiya gaya tha or use ek barf rani ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya, lekin yah pramanit ho gaya ki usamen ugr kamlipsaa or bhaavnaatmak matra prakruti he
 From the first season itself, the issue of homosexuality was included, which was a rare step for American television networks in the 1980s
 pehle sizan ke episod "da boej in da baar" main sam kaa ek dost or purv team sadsy unki aatmakatha se baahar aate hai

 or phir, sanyam hasil karne ke baad usne "bhaavnaatmak kaarnon" ke liye sharabakhaana ko kharidne or sanchaalan karne kaa faisla kiya
 imdb plot Summary of Cheers In the episode "the Tangle" of the fourth season, Frasier was also battling alcoholism, while in the seventh season of "call Me Erasponsible", Woody developed a gambling problem
 kuch aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki aam taur par sam kaa ek vyasankaree vyaktitv tha jisane apni sharaab kii lat par vijay praapt kii, lekin phir bhi usamen yon vyasan upasthit tha, jo uske vyabhichaar se pradarshit hota he or jiske liye vah antat madad praapt karata he
 Norm addiction was never the main focus of the program
 jaahir taur par sam se pehle chibers ke kai maalik the, chunki sharabakhaane kii shuruuaat 1889 main hui thi 
 tisare episod main "sams women", norm, chibers ke maalik ko dhundne vaale ek graahak se kahata he ki jis aadmi ko vah chibers kaa maalik samajhataa tha vah badal chukaa he or uske is pratisthaapan ko sam dwaara badal diya gaya tha
 In the subsequent episode, Gus o'malley, who sold Sam the tavern, returns from Arizona to run the bar for one night
 chibers ke swaamitv ko lekar sabase adhik kahani kii shuruuaat paanchaven sizan ke final, "ai du, edeu" se hui thi, jab sam or diana alag ho gaye the, shele laung apni niyamit bhoomika ko chhod chuki thi or sam prithvi ke chaaron ore saiyr karne ke prayaas main tha

 saatven sizan ke premier "haau tu rised in bijnes" main ribeka ko baahar nikaal diya jaataa he or sam ko prabandhak ke rup main padonnati praapt hoti he
 Rebecca is ambiguously allowed to do the job at Lillian, which she used to do earlier, but this is only when she "consents" to a lengthy list of demands by Sam for the corporation
 vahiin se sam kabhi-kabhi sharabakhaane ko waapas kharidne kii koshish karata he, ek aise skim ke saath jisamen aamtaur par amir kaaryakari robin kolcord shaamil hote hai

 mudde par chuppi saadhe rahane kii vajah se nigam dwaara nikaale gaye rebeka ko sam dwaara paricharika / karyaalay prabandhak kii naukari waapas de di jaati he
 In addition to the plot that spans the series, Cheers has a number of themes with no plot but appearing several times
 chauthe sizan ke "from bear tu iturenity" episod se chibers or pratidwandvi sharabakhaana geri oldy touni tevern ke saath katu pratidwandita hoti he
 One episode of each season saw one of the bets between Sam and Gerry, beginning in the sixth season, a bet that was a game contest or battle of wisdom that degenerated into complex practical jokes
 sabase pehle or antim "baar vars" episod ke alaava, chibers giroh lagbhag hameshaa gairi ke vishisht pratibha ko kho dete hai, haalanki ek prakaran main ve use vaarshik bldi mairi pratiyogita main lupt karne kii chaal main kaamyaab rahe
 
 In another episode, Sam collaborates with Gary to avenge his former co-workers on a practical prank
 sharabakhaane ke thik aage sthit oonche darje ke melvil restaraan ke prabandhan ke saath bhi sam kaa lambe samay se jhagada tha
 The restaurant's management certainly lost the bar's clientele, while Sam was known to be a sophomore lover
 The conflict escalated in the later seasons when Melville came under the ownership of John Allen Hill and emerged as such Sam did not technically purchase the bar's pullroom and bathroom
 baad main sam unke liye kiraaya bhugtan karne par majboor ho gaye or aksar hill ke atyaachaar kii dayaa par khud ko paaya
 Rebecca eventually buys the back section from Hill and partners herself and Sam in managing the bar
 norm petersan lagaataar ek lekhaakaar ke rup main laabhakaari rojgaar ke liye khoj karata rahaa, lekin kai series main berozegaar hi rahaa, isliye chibers main uske nirantar upasthiti ko ek hi tarah se samajhaayaa gaya he

 karla ke aath bacchon ko bhi kukhyat rup se bura bartaav karte dikhaaya gaya he, sivaay lud ke jiskaa janm ek pramukh vidwaan dwaara hua tha

 yah mahatvapurn samarthan, emi par praarambhik safalataa or enbisi ke antertenment prabhag ke adhyaksh brandon tarticof ke samarthan ke saath jud gaya or ise kaarykram ke astitv or antat safal banane kaa mukhya kaaran samajha jaataa he
 After the first season, the actors themselves joined various talk shows around the world in an attempt to promote the series
 With the increasing popularity of Family Ties which was featured in the forward slot of Cheers, from January 1984 until Family Ties moved to Sunday in 1987 and the Cosby program was put in front of the duo at the start of the third season, the line -up was an amazing success in ratings, which was eventually converted to "must See Thursday" by NBC

 sizan 1 ke dauraan keval ek set, sharabakhaana main saare episod ko banaaya gaya
 Other sets were introduced in later seasons, but the program had the potential to be action in the center of the tavern and not to be distracted by the issue
 enbisi ne chibers ke antim episod ke liye puri raat ko samarpit kiya or sizan ke phinale senfeld ke netritv main ek-ghante kaa tha

 chibers ke kuch abhinaytaon or abhinetriyon ne duusare televijan kaaryakramon main apane charitron ko atithi yaa nae up-nirmaan main pesh kiya
 Cheers' most successful sub-production was the Frasier program, which directly follows Frasier Crane after his transfer back to Seattle, Washington, to live with his recently disabled father and to host a radio program
 frezier ko multah ek chota naapsand charitra hona chahie jo keval diana or sam ke sambandhon ko badhaane ke liye maujuud hota he, lekin kelsi grammer ke abhinay ke kaaran jin linon ko bemaza hone chahie the ve kamedi main parivartit ho jate hai, jisase darshakon kaa kaaphi mazaa aata he

 The show featured Carla's ex-husband Nick Tortelli and his wife Loretta, but was canceled after 13 episodes and protested for its traditional description of the italian-american
 pratyaksh up-nirmaan ke alaava chibers ke kai charitra anya kaaryakramon main atithi ke rup main abhinay karte dikhaai die
 Possibly, Cheers was the first major television series since i Love Lucy that excluded science fiction or child television that included a significant licensing campaign

 Similarly, in the recent times of avian influenza and the West Nile virus, more humans have probably dropped in population due to the relationship between the carrier host and domestic animals
 Highly mobile animals such as bats and birds may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission from animals due to the ease with which they can move in areas of human habitation
