 sankat prabandhan main nimnlikhit shaamil hai: Crisis management methods of a business or organization are called crisis management plans
 sankat prabandhan ko kabhi-kabhi durghatana prabandhan ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, haalanki peter power sareekhe kai udyog visheshgy yah tark dete hai ki sankat prabandhan shabd adhik sateek he
 The concept of response during crisis management has a profound influence on the credibility and reputation of organizations
 ek samaybaddh tareeke se sankat se nibatane main shaamil sanghathan evam samvaad vyavsaay ke liye ek chunauti hota he
 To contribute to a successful crisis dialogue process, open and regular communication throughout the hierarchy is bound to occur

 haalanki yah kahana sach nahin hoga ki chunki sarvanaash ke jokhim ko purna rup se kam karnaa kabhi sambhav nahin ho saktaa isiilie sankat prabandhan jokhim prabandhan kii vifaltaa kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 During the process of crisis management, it is important to know the types of crises, as different crises require different crisis management strategies
 sambhavya sankat asankhya hai lekin unke samooh banaae ja sakate hai
 Lerbinger has classified seven types of crises prakritik sankat - prakritik aapadaaon ko aam taur par "ishwar kaa kahar" mana jaataa he - bukamp, jwalamukhi visphot, aandhi-toofaan, baadh, bhuskhalan, jowar lahar, chakravaati toofaan evam sookhaa aadi aisi paryaavarni ghatnaayen hai jo jivan, sampada, evam swayan paryaavaran ke liye khatra hai
 Technology crisis arises due to human application of science and technology
 jab prodyogiki jatil rup le leti he or yugmit hoti he or pranali main purnataya koi gadabadi ho gayi ho to pradyogiki durghatnaayen hona avashyambhavi he
 Some technology crises arise when human error causes disruptions
 log prodyogeky aapadaa ke liye dosha madhne ko taiyaar rahete hai kyonki prodyogiki maanviya herpher kaa vishay he jabaki ve prakritik aapadaa ke liye kisi ko zimmedaar nahin tehraate
 jab koi durghatana mahatvapurn paryaavaran kshati kaa kaaran banataa he to us sankat ko mahavinaash ke rup main vargeekrut karte hai
 Samples include software failure, industrial accidents, and oil spills
 takaraav sankat tab utpann hota he jab asantusht vyakti / yaa samooh apni maangon or apekshaaon ko manwaane ke liye vyavsaayon, sarkaar evam vibhinn hit samoohon se ladate hai
 Exorcism is a common type of confrontation crisis and other types of picketing, sitting, giving final warning to authorities, blockade or occupation of building and resisting or disobeying the police
 jab virdohi log yaa updravi vyakti sambhawatah asthirataa yaa vidhwans failaane ke uddeshy se kisi company, desh, yaa aarthik pranali se laabh uthaane yaa uske prati apana virombhav yaa krodh jataane ke liye aapraadhik upayon yaa anyaanya charam daanv-pench kaa istemaal karte hai, to sanghathan ko droh sankat kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Samples of such crises include product tampering, kidnapping, malicious rumors, terrorism and espionage
 yah sankat tab utpann hota he jab prabandhan bine paryaapt saavdhaanee ke evam yah jaanate hue bhi koi karrwai karti he ki isse share dharakon ko nuksaan pahonchega yaa unke liye jokhim kii sthiti paidaa hogi
 larbinger ne sanghathanaatmak dushkarmon ke teen bhinn prakaar vargeekrut kiye hai: visham prabandhan mulya kaa sankat, dhokhe kaa sankat evam prabandhan ke kadachaar kaa sankat
 a crisis of skewed management values arises when managers favor short-term economic gains and defy share holders and broader social values, in addition to investors
 ekatarfa mulyon kii yah sthiti pratishthit vyavsaay kii jadon main basaa hua he jo shairdharakon ke hiton par dhyaan detaa he evam graahakon, karmchaariyon evam samudaay jaise anyaanya shairdharakon ke hiton ko dekhtaa he
 a crisis of deception arises when management hides or misrepresents information about itself and its product in its dealings with customers
 kuch sankat na sirf visham mulyon evam dhokhe se balki sochi-samajhi aniti evam avaidhta se bhi paidaa hoti hai
 This crisis arises when an employee or former employee commits violence against other employees on an organizational basis
 kisi sanghathan yaa uske utpaada ke bare main galat jaankaree sanghathan kii pratishtha ko thes pahunchaate hue sankat kii sthiti paidaa karti he
 Such as spreading an organization's connection to a radical group or spreading its product that they are corrupt
 kisi sankat ko safaltaapurvak vifal karne ke liye uske ghatane se pehle yah samaj zaruri he ki kisi sankat se kaise nibatna he
 gonzalez-herrero & Pratt created a four-stage crisis management model process, which includes the following: management issues, prevention-planning, crisis and post-crisis
 It is an art to define what a crisis is or could actually be
 How it may or may arise
 koi bhi korporation yah nahin chahta he ki koi bhi sthiti unke vyavsaay ke liye mahatvapurn baadha kaa kaaran bane, khaas taur par vah jo vyapak media kawarej ko badhaava de
 saarvajanik jaanch kaa parinaam nakaaratmak vittiya, raajnneetik, kanoonee evam sarkari prabhaav ho saktaa he

 Preparing advance contingency plans as part of the Crisis Management Plan is the first step towards an organization being properly prepared to deal with a crisis
 sankat prabandhan timen ek drill ke rup main istemaal karne ke liye ek jhootha paridrishy viksit kar kisi sankat yojana kaa abhyaas kar sakate hai
 The plan should clearly stipulate that only nominees, such as company spokespersons or crisis team members, can publicly negotiate a crisis
 The first hour after a crisis occurs is the most important, so it is important to work with speed and efficiency and the plan should indicate how fast each task should be done
 Information should be very accurate while preparing for external as well as internal statements
 Giving wrong or manipulated information is likely to go in vain and may make the situation worse

 naveenta ke prasar kaa siddhant soochna kaa saajha karne main prayukt ek or siddhant he
 This theory, developed by Everett Rodgers, describes how innovation is transmitted and communicated through certain channels over a period
 sanchaar dwaara naveenta kaa prasar tab hota he jab koi vyakti ek nae vichaar ko kisi anya vyakti yaa bahut se anyaanya vyaktiyon ko bataata he
 This process in its most basic form involves the following: n novelty, a person of acquisition or other entity with knowledge of innovation or experience of using it, another person or other entity who has no knowledge of innovation until now
 , And a communication channel connecting the two units
 a communication channel is the means by which messages are passed from one person to another

 The study that first came to light in the studies conducted on the impact of the horrific disaster on the share price of an organization was completed by Dr
 Rory Knight and Dr
 Deborah Prati
 In this study, a detailed analysis was done of the share values of the organization experiencing the disaster

 recoveraron ke liye share dharak mulya par ausat sanchayi prabhaav unke mul share mulya se 5% adhik tha
 Thus the overall impact on shareholder value up to this level was actually positive
 non recoverrs hathaat ai ghor aapadaa ke baad 5 se 50 dinon ke bich kamobesh aparivartit rahe, lekin uske ek saal baad tak unke share mulya par takreeban 15% kaa shuddh nakaaratmak sanchayi prabhaav jhelana padaa

 sometimes
 Similar reactions occurred in the days of the incident

 a detailed study of interference works at the core of all instruments with large resolution power
 bhautik prakaashiki main is dhaaran kaa samavesh thomas yang ne kiya
 Interference after them has been used to express the homogenous or tajjanic effects of waves or vibrations of any kind
 sankshep main kisi bhi tarah kii tarangagati ke kaaran laharon ke takaraav se utpann sthiti ko vyatikaran kii sangya di jaati he
 Whenever two different wavelengths meet together on the surface of water or any other fluid, a state of interference can occur
 jahaan ek tarangasamooh se sambanddh laharon ke tarangashringon kaa duusari shrunkhlaa se sambhddhalaharon ke tanrgashringon se sammilin hota he, vahaan drav kii sataha kaa unnayan us sthaan par laharon ke swatantra or ekant astitv ke sambhav unnayanon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 When the wavelength of one of the waves ends at the wavelength of the other, the wave oscillation at the surface of the fluid is reduced and the yield gradient is equal to the difference between the elevation of one wave component and the gradient of the other
 dhwani main utpann vispand isi vyatikaran kaa ek saadhaaran rup he, jahaan do yaa do se adhik tarangasamooh, jinke tarangadairdhya main maamuli sa antar hota he, kareeb ek hi disha main agrasar hote hue milte hai
 The speed of light is waves
 kisi ekal prakashasrot se ni:sruth urja madhyam ke parshv main saan rup se bikhar jaati he
 If two independent sources of light from which waves of the same magnitude and integral art form continuously oscillate, are placed adjacent to each other, then the distribution of energy around the medium is not congruent, where the beak of one light is on the beak of the other light, Or the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the amplitude increases there and the energy or light intensity of the amplitude also increases
 saath hi, yadi ek kaa tarangashring duusare ke tarangagart par gire, to parinami aayam shunya hota he or prakaash kii tivrata ghat jaati he
 The first state is called collateral interference and the second one is called destructive interference
 paardarshee thos ke patale patton or sabun ke bulabulon par prakaash kii kirnon ke padane par vyatikaran kaa spasht parichay mil saktaa he
 When rays of light fall on soap bubbles, or thin strips of lead, the rays from both their outer and inner surfaces are reflected and returned to the observer's eyes and in wavelets of light that reach the eyes from both sources, Due to the subtle differences in the arts, there is interference, due to which the effects produced are quite seductive and fascinating
 sabun kaa koi bulbula ekvarni prakaash main praaia: kuch kaali rekhaon se aavruth dikhaai padataa he
 The reason is that the two wavelengths of light at the black visible points, which come from the inner and outer surfaces of the bubble, respectively, almost or completely destroy each other's effects
 yadi bulbula shwet prakaash main dekha jaae, to hamen saamanyatya kaali rekhaayen nahin dikhaai padatin
 They are replaced by strips of color
 aisa isliye hota he ki vibhinn rang, jinke yoga se shwet prakaash kii utpatti hoti he bhinn bhinn tarangon ke hote hai, jisase bulbule ke kisi bindu par vyatikaran se rang ke keval ek ansh maatr kaa vinaash hota he or ujle prakaash ke shesh avyav batch rahete hai, jo aankhon par apana purna varniya prabhaav utpann karte hai
 There are some basic conditions that need to be met for the deviation
 inamen se kuch to prakaash kii prakruti main hi antarnihit he or duusari, yadi parinaam kaa prekshan prayog dwaara karnaa hua to, aavashyak ho uthati he
 For simplicity, we can consider two electromagnetic waves, which produce perishable interference at a point from where both waves pass
 yadi vyatikaran kaa praturup sthir rahaa, arthath yadi prakaash kii tivrata kaa parinami tathakthith bindu par samay ke prayek maan ke liye shunya ho, to nimnlikhit sharton kii purti aavashyak he : Two other conditions for successful observation of light-generated patterns, which must be met, are: yadi do atisannikat prakashasrot ke samaan pariman or kalantar kii taragen kisi kalantar vishesh par kuch dur sthit parde ke ek bindu par milen, to parde par kuch bilkul kii rekhaayen jinke antaraal main adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen rahati hai, dekhi jaati hai
 Those minimum and maximum intensity lines are called interpolation fringes
 jab kabhi vyatikaran fringen patali filmon ke chalate banati hai, tab unka kaaran vyatikaran main bhaag lenevaali kirnon ke kalantar kaa parivartan hota he
 This change is caused by a change of film thickness, or a change of volume angle
 yadi motaai samang nahin hui, to praaia: donon tathy ek hi saath kriyasheel ho uthte hai; lekin ek baat spasht he ki jab koi film aankh dwaara dekhi ja rahi he, to use aankh se kareeb 25 senmi
 kii duuri par rakhaa janaa chahie
 If the range of the film is not very large, the difference of the tilt of the rays coming from different points of the film to our eyes is not much and the volume angle of each ray is almost equal
 at: fringen mukhyat: film kii motaai kii bhinnata ke kaaran banati he
 It is also quite clear that at all the points of the film, where the thickness is the same, the light will be the same
 yadi aisa koi bhi bindu kaala yaa ujwal hua, to shesh bhi tadnurup kaale yaa ujwal honge
 Therefore, black or bright strips are just the point of different points of the film of the same thickness

 Template: Grammatical categories Grammatical tense is a periodic linguistic quality expressing any position or time of a verb, by, during, or beyond the verb
 kaal bhav, awaz or pahalu ke saath, chaar gunon main se kam se kam ek he, jo abhivyakti spasht kar sakate hai
 Tenses reflect the contrast of occasional references to the development of an expression
 sabhi bhashaaen samaan kaal istemaal karti hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, haalanki hameshaa in kaalon kii abhivyakti kaa anuwaad spasht rup se ek bhashaa se duusari bhashaa main nahin kiya ja saktaa
 jabaki sabhi bhashaaon main kriya ke theth rup hote hai jiske dwaara ve shabdkoshon main pahachaane jate hai or krambaddh kiye jate hai, saadharantah sabase aam vartmaan kaal yaa ek saadhaaran rup, unke kaal abhivyakt karne ke tareekon kaa istemaal, bhashaaon ke bich bhinn he
 There are some languages in which tense is not interlinked through the verb form nor expressed structurally, but instead, whenever needed, the underlying adverb is intertwined with the use of adjectives and some contain topical information
 Appears by the use of intransitive adjectives
 kuch bhashaaon main pahalu or kaal par ek saath sanket karne ke liye ek ekal kriya antahkunchit kii ja sakati he
 The number of tenses in a language can be disputed, as the tense noun is often mistaken for displaying occasional expressions, extra facets and even expressions
 kai granthon main, kaal shabd galati se anischitata, aavruti, nishpatti, avadhi, sambhaavna kii gunvattta ko sanderbhit karata he or yahan tak ki ise bhi ki kya jaankaree anubhav se vyutpann hoti he yaa afvaah se 
 yah vastav main kaal nahin hai, lekin paramparaagat namapaddati aksar unka aise vargeekaran karti he
 In reality, all languages have the same tenses
 ye aam taur par teen samoohon main vibhajit hote hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, jisamen ek nirdhaarit abhipraay main prayek shrenee baddh hota he
 For example, past tenses are those in which the occasional reference to the component verb occurs before the occasional reference to the statement itself
 bhoot kaal, saamaanya ateet / bhoot se lekar tatkaal ateet / bhoot, sudur yaa dur sudur ateet / bhoot tak bhi shrenee baddh ho saktaa he, inke bich sirf ek hi antar hota he or vah he, samayik sandarbh binduon ke bich ghatnakram par duuri
 In English, tense is divided into two types of groups - pure tense and verb tense
 Pure tense refers to the manifestations of the present, past and future in which the secondary topical context is considered absolutely certain or known
 duusare shabdon main, shuddh kaal un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann sach mana yaa janaa jaataa he
 On the other hand, verb gesture refers to the manifestations of present, past, or future in which the certainty of attestation is not completely certain
 angrezi main yah rup ek kriyabhaav dyotak, kriyabhaav dyotak kahawat yaa kriyabhaav dyotak kriya-visheshan jodne se abhivyakt kiye jate hai
 The past tense is expressed only in English by subtracting the verb
 sabhi kachche or achook pahaluon main, bhoot kaal pheravat rup main abhimukhataa poorak, tha / the, hona ) ke paroksh rup ke istemaal se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In non-periodic aspects, the past tense can be expressed through a particular intransitive form in which the component verb has been used indirectly, except for the aspectual complement 'done'
 yah rup keval kuch hi sakaaratmak vyakhyanon main sambhav he
 In all other types of utterances, the inflection form must be employed
 vartmaan kaal bhoot kaal ke saamaan ek achihnit rup ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he, lekin isamen abhimukhataa poorak keval pheravat roopon main vyakti or sankhya he / hai, he / he ) ke saath samjhaute ke liye hi manaa kiye jate hai
 Interpreted forms, as with past tense, can be used for some positive lectures
 angrezi main shuddh bhavishya kaal vartmaan kaal kii tarah hi abhivyakt kiya jaataa he lekin ek bhavishya -chihnak kriya-visheshan yaa samay padbandh ke saath
 In English, the adverb denotative tense is expressed either by the use of a fully accepted adverb denotative form or by an additional adverb denotative adverb or a pure tense form with a phrase
 In English, the verb dative sign is most often used to express the future tense
 kriyabhaav dyotak bhavishya aath bhavishya roopon main se kisi ko bhi sanderbhit karata he jisamen bhavishya parinaamon ke anishchit swaroop ke kaaran anupramann ko sach nahin kaha ja saktaa
 yah rup nischitata ke hisaab se bhinn hote hai or hameshaa ek sahaayak manodasha ke abhipraay ke bheetar bhavishya nischitata kaa vah str abhivyakt karte hai
 The following list shows examples of tense expressions in some indo-european and finno-arjic periods using the verb "go"
 kaal mote taur par vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya ke rup main vargeekrut kiye gaye hai
 Several possible periods exist within these broad classifications
 in kaalon ke bich antar mukhya rup se kathan ke samay se samayik duuri kii degree kaa he
 For example, within the general category of the past tense, the immediate past, the distant past, the distant past and the distant past may exist, the difference being only the increase in the distance from the time of the narration to the narration
 kuch bhashaaen keval bhoot, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bich hi bhed nahin karti, balki gair-bhoot, gair-vartmaan, gair-bhavishya ke bich main bhi

 swot vishleshan ek prakalp yaa ek vyavsaayik udhyam main shaamil sha ktiyon, k majoriyon, a vasaron or kha taron ke moolyankan ke liye istemaal kiya gaya ek samrik yojana kram he
 This includes specifying the goal of the business venture or project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for achieving that goal

 a SWOT analysis must first begin with defining a desired end state or objective
 ek swot vishleshan ek ranneetik yojana model main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Strategic planning, including swot and scan analysis, has been the subject of much research
 swotus kii pahchaan karnaa jaruri he kyonki chaynit uddeshy kii prapti ke liye yojana banane kii prakriya main uttargami kadam swotus se praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 First, decision makers have to find out if the objective is achievable, with certain swotas
 If the objective is not feasible, a different objective must be selected and the process repeated
 swot vishleshan aksar shaktiyon, kamajoriyon, avasaron or khataron par prakaash daalane or pahchaan karne ke liye shaikshanik samudaay main upyog hota he
 This is particularly useful in identifying areas for development
 swot ko upyog karne kaa ek or tarika he milan env parivartit 
 Matching powers are matched by matching opportunities
 parivartit karnaa matlab kamiyon yaa khataron ko shaktiyon yaa avasaron main badalane ke liye roopantaran ranneetiyon kaa prayog karnaa
 An example of a conversion strategy is to discover new markets
 yadi khataron yaa kamajoriyon ko parivartit nahin kiya ja saktaa to ek company ko unhen kam karne yaa taalane kii koshish kerani chahie
 Swot analysis can limit the strategies considered in evaluation
 je
 scot armastrang tippanee karte hai ki "log jo swot prayog karte hai, yah anumaan laga sakate hai ki unhone yojana banane kaa kaam paryaapt maatra main kiya he or company ke uddeshyon ko paribhaashit karne yaa vaikalpik ranneetiyon ke liye ROI dhoort karne jaisi sachet chizon ko andekha kar dete hai
 "resulting results from Menon et al and Hill and Westbrook have shown that swot can damage performance
 swot ke ek vikalp ke rup main, armastrang ek 5-kadam drushtikon vikalp kaa varnan karata he jo behatar sangathit kaary-sampadan kii ore le jaataa he
 These criticisms have been addressed to an earlier version of the SWOT analysis, which is ahead of the SWOT analysis described under the heading "strategic and Fundamental Experiments of SWOT Analysis"
 is puraane sanskaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi ki swot ek sahamat hue uddeshy se praapt hon
 swot vishleshan ke udhaaharan jo ek uddeshy kaa varnan nahin karte neeche "maanav sansaadhan" or "vipanan" ke tahat pradaan kiye gaye hai
 The purpose of any SWOT analysis is to identify the basic internal and external factors that are important for achieving the goal
 yah company kii anokhi mulya shrinkhalaa ke bheetar se aate hai
 Swot analysis groups information pieces into two main categories: sanghathan ke uddeshyon par unke prabhaav ke aadhaar par aantarik karkon ko shakti yaa kamajoriyon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 One who shows strength in relation to one objective may be a weakness for another purpose
 karkon main sabhi 4P ke saath hi saath carmik, vittiya, vinirmaan kshamtaayen or kai anya bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 External factors may include macroeconomic matters, technological changes, legislation, social and cultural changes, as well as changes in market and competitive position
 parinaam aksar ek matrix ke rup main prastut kiye jate hai
 Swot analysis is just one method of classification and has its own weaknesses
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah companiyon ko suchi sankalan karne ke liye uksaa saktaa he bajaay ki is bare main sochane ke ki uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye vastav main kya mahatvapurn he
 It also presents the resulting list as non-critical and without clear priority so that, for example, weak opportunities appear to balance strong threats
 kisi ummidavaar swot pravesh ko bahut jaldi khatam nahin karnaa mitavyayi he
 The importance of individual swotas will be revealed by the value of the strategies generated
 a swatch component that produces valuable strategies is important
 ek swot ansh jo koi ranneeti utpann nahin karata, mahatvapurn nahin he
 The utility of SWOT analysis is not limited to profit-making organizations
 swot vishleshan kisi bhi faisla-nirmaan karne vaali sthiti main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, jab ek vaanchit ant-avasthaa paribhaashit hoti he
 Examples include: non-profit organizations, government entities, and individuals
 Swot analysis can also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive crisis management
 swot vishleshan vyavhaaryata adhyayan ke dauraan ek sifarish banane main bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Swotte-visuals capture different managerial positions by observing and estimating the dynamic performance of comparable objects according to the masterminded results of Braden Kitts, Leaf Edwinson, and Tord Bedding
 sambandhi pradarshan main parivartan kii lagaataar pahchaan kii jaati he
 Projects that could be potential risks or opportunity items have been highlighted
 swot -bhudrishy un antarnihit shakti / kamajori karkon ko bhi sankethik karata he jinhen upyog kiye gaye mulya ke sandarbh main yaan to sabase zyada prabhaav hua he yaan hone kii sambhaavna he 
 As part of developing the strategy and plans, then that organization will use a systematic / rigorous process called corporate planning, to make the organization qualified in achieving its goals
 PEST / PESTLE ke saath swot vyapaar or paryaavaran karkon ke vishleshan ke liye ek aadhaar ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In many competitor analyzes, vendors create detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, using SWOT analysis specifically focusing on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses
 The marketing manager will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of benefits, resources and qualifications, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of vertical integration, historical responses to industry development, and other factors
 vipanan prabandhan aksar sateek bazaar vishleshan karne main aavashyak data ikattha karne ke liye anusandhan main nivesh karnaa zaruri samajhate hai
 Accordingly, management often conducts market research to obtain this information
 Vendors use various techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common ones include: HRM main vishishtikaran ke saath ek chote prabandhan paraamarsh kaary kii bazaar sthiti kaa vishleshan karne ke liye swot kaa prayog

 It is a code designed to operate an organization
 yah praayah likhit rup main hota he
 It is the method which is the basis of governance of a nation; Determines its character, organization, and explains its method of use, it is the ultimate law of the nation and consumes special statutory status
 All the prevailing laws must necessarily conform to the spirit of the constitution if they violate it
 They are declared unconstitutional
 bharat kaa samvidhan vishwa ke kisi bhi samprabhu desh kaa sabase lambaa likhit samvidhan he, jisamen, uske angrezi-bhashi sanskaran main 146,385 shabdon ke saath, 22 bhaagon main 444 anuchhed, 12 anusuchiyaan or 101 sanshodhan hai, jabaki monako kaa samvidhan sabase chota likhit samvidhan he, jisamen 97 anuchhedon ke saath 10 adhyay, or kul 3,814 shabd hai
 The term constitution is commonly used in two forms, compressed and expanded
 vistrut rup main iskaa prayog kisi rajya ke shashanprabandh sambandhi sab niyamon ke liye hota he
 Some of these rules are valid and enforced by the courts, but there are others which are not completely legal
 in vidhi se pare ardhvaidhanik niyamon kii utpatti roodhi, paramparaagat prathaon, prachlit vyavhaar evam vidhi vyakhya se hoti he
 Due to their impure form, these rules are not recognized in the courts, but still in the practicality of governance, their effect is constitution of pure rules
 england kaa vidhaan is kathan kaa sakshi he
 In other countries, the constitution means more narrowly, and only in relation to the special rules that are tied up in official documents for governance
 falat: samvidhan ek prakaar se kisi desh kaa vah ek yaa adhik lekhptr hota he jisamen us desh ke shashanprabandh main anushaasan ke mul niyam sankalit hon
 The United States and India's constitution are witnesses to this meaning
 'samvidhan' shabd kaa aashay koi bhi mana jaae kintu mul vastu yah he ki kisi desh ke samvidhan kaa purna adhyayan keval kuch likhit niyamon ke avlokan ke sambhav nahin
 Because, they are only a part of the discipline related to governance
 sampurna sanvaidhanik parichay shashanprabandheey sab angon ke adhyayan se hi sambhavit ho saktaa he
 For example, in the Constitution contract, only the main organs of governance - the executive, the legislative assembly, the judiciary - are mentioned
 kintu in sansthaaon kii rachana, padaadhikariyon kii niyukti kii reeti ityadi kii vyakhya saadhaaran vidhi dwaara hi nishchit hoti he
 Similarly, in many countries, the electoral rules, the number of members per constituency and per region, the composition of government departments and the organization of the judiciary, all these important functions are not explained in the Constitution; Even if it is, in a very simple way, it is mainly described and controlled by ordinary method
 iske atirikt sampurna vidhirachana vidhanmandal ke kshetra main hi simit nahi hoti, nyaaypalika dwaara mulavidhi kii vyakhya dwaara jo niyam prasphutit hote hai unase samvidhan main nity sanshodhanatmak naveenta aati rahati he
 Again, state-related stereotypes and attitudes are also no less influential and important
 atev in sab anshon kaa adhyayan hi sarvang vaidhanik parichay purna kar saktaa he
 But within the purview of the word 'constitutional scripture' only pure legal rules come, all others are considered constitutional practices
 samvidhan ke do prakaar hai : likhit evam alikhit
 Written constitutions are mostly a lekhya or some compiled lekhya
 kintu jis rup main samvidhan kriyanvit hota he uski vyakhya na kahin purnataya likhit hoti he, na purnataya alikhit
 The Constitution of England is considered unwritten but there are also Acts of Settlement in 1701, several Representations of People's Acts, the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 by which the powers of the Lord House were limited, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 1816 and 1862, and 1947 The Crown Proceedings Act was created in AD
 in likhit niyamon kaa mahatv england ke samvidhan main, alikhit roodhi, parampara tathaa vyavhaar se tanik bhi kam nahin he
 In contrast, in the written constitution of India, some unwritten rules are found in complementary form, such as privileges of legislatures and members, relationship of President and Governor to Council of Ministers, constitutional crisis and the position of Governor, in relation to all these subjects of the Constitution
 Additional unwritten rules only apply
 samvidhan sambandhi anya bhed hai - namansheel evam paridrudh, bahudhaa inhen kramshah: alikhit evam likhit ke paryaayavachi rup main bhi prayukt kiya jaataa he
 Lord Bryce has used the words humbly in place of writing and soft words in place of the unwritten
 kintu is prakaar kaa mishrit prayog uchit nahin
 In fact, the constitution can be written but flexible and can be unwritten but landscape

 If we look at the history of England, it would seem that changes have always taken place in the form of gradual development; There is no possibility of contingency
 matpradaan, swatantraaa sudhaar, lard sabha kii satta ke hanan sambandhi niyam, tathaa yudhoparant adhirajya swashaasan adhikaar in sabake hote hue bhi ek shatabdi ke abhyantar main england kaa samvidhan alikhit hokar bhi kam parivartan hue hai
 As a result, the constitution of England, despite being unwritten, is not a salutary one
 iske vipareet bhartiya samvidhan paridrudh kaha jaataa he, kaaran ki isaki sanshodhanakriya badi jatil he, jahaan kisi kisi vishay main sanshodhan ke liye keval kendriya sansad kaa bahumat hi paryaapt nahin varan samast rajyon ke vidhanmandalon kaa bahumat praapt karnaa bhi anivaary he
 Even after such a complex system, many amendments have been made in the Indian Constitution in the last several years
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki sanshodhan parivarttan evam sanshodhan kaa sambandh keval sanshodhanakriya kii likhit vyavastha se nahin varan desh kii pramukh prabhavatmak raajnneetik dalbandiyon ke santosh yaa asantosh se hota he
 Changes do not occur if they are satisfied with the statutory framework and the distribution of political power through it, otherwise amendments, rotations, changes are inevitable
 sanvaidhanik sanshodhano kaa kaaran congressi sarkarein thim jinke niyantran main kendriya tathaa lagbhag samast rajyon ke shashan kii bagdor thi
 Therefore, the form of any constitution is salutary or scenario, it can only explain the constitutional history of that country
 yadi kahin parivartan sahaj rup se hote rahe hai to us desh kaa samvidhan namansheel he, anyathaa paridrudh
 Following the example of the United States of America, the practice of written constitution has become prevalent in most countries
 likhit samvidhan kahin vidhayika dwaara nirmit hote hai jaise 'american articalj ov kanfaderation' ne america main tathaa austrio hungarian sangh ne 1867 main austria main kiya
 Despite the desire, many emperors and kings also made constitutions in their countries in the nineteenth century
 france main 1814 tathaa 1830 i
 main tathaa 1848 i
 main sardenia main isi prakaar vahaan ke samraterchit samvidhan ghoshit hue
 Other constitutions were mostly made by the legislatures of the country, such as the United States of America in 1787 AD and India in 1949
 adhikanshtya un samast deshon main jahaan likhit samvidhan upasthit he, samvidhan ko desh kii anya vidhiyon se adhik manyata di jaati he
 The reason for this is that the constitution itself originated from the feeling that autocracy can be disciplined and limited in governance
 shashanprabandh samvidhan ke bandhanon se kitna niyantrit hoga athwa samvidhan ke bandhanon se kitna niyantrit hoga, athwa samvidhan kitna ucch mana jayega, yah samvidhannirmaataaon ke uddeshy evam drushtikon par nirbhar karata he ki vah kis vishay main samvidhan kii kitni manyata evam suraksha ke icchhuk the
 At the time of the creation of the Indian constitution, there were many basic questions before the framers, such as the protection of the basic rights of the citizens, a clear explanation of the scope of the Center and the states, so that both confine their legal practice within their prescribed limits, the form of the constitution should be kept in perspective, and the states In mutual commerce business, protecting freedom etc
 desh main karypalika yaa vidhayika ke samast kaaryon kii shuddhta tathaa auchity isi par nirbhar karata he ki vah desh ke sanvaidhanik uddeshy bandhanon ke anukool he athwa nahin, yadi koi kaary in mul uddeshyon ke pratikul hota he to vah shakti bahya kaha jaataa he
 Where there is legal application and interpretation in the Supreme Court of the state, most of the time there is also a certainty as to whether such a statute is out of power or not
 amareeki samvidhan ke ek pramukh rachayita hamiltan ke anusaar samvidhan vastav main mul vidhi he tathaa nyaayadhishon ko sadaa is tathy ko sweekaar kar manyata deni chahie
 When there is opposition in the ordinary statutes and constitution made by the legislatures, then the constitution should be given higher and primary recognition
 kaaran yah he ki samvidhan swayan desh kii janata ke aantarik uddeshyon kii abhivyakti he jab ki anya vidhi us janata kii pratinidhi sabhaaon kii bhaawanaaon kii pratik hoti he
 Naturally the constitution is original and superior
 america ke pradhan nyaayadhish marshall ne 1803 main marbaro banaam medisson kaa nirnay isi niyam ke anusaar kiya tha
 Where there is an unwritten constitution, there is no need for a constitutional rule on governance, but this kind of control and discipline is instinctively carried out by fear of public opinion and election-action, traditions and stereotypes
