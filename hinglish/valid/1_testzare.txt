 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"

 The Vanaparva of Mahabharata says- jain granth, tattwarth sutara main 10 dharmon kaa varnan he
 Here are 10 religions: schizophreniya manodasha main manushya ko apane vyaktitv kaa kuch gyaan hi nahin rah jaataa
 There is neither a question of gaiety nor gloom in his life
 atev is manodasha ko doosraa bachapan kaha ja saktaa he
 On coming in this mood, the patient has no power to handle himself
 vah malmutra ke nity kaary bhi nahin kar paata
 He makes excrement on the bed itself
 uske hansane or rone main koi vichaar hi nahin rahata
 No estimate can be made about what time he will do it
 do chaar minute tarkyukt baaten karte hue vah koi aisi baat kah saktaa he jo bilkul anargal ho
 He can strangle the child standing in front of him while laughing
 schizophreniya ke rogi andhvishwasi hote hai ve na keval ishwar ko dekhte hai balki unase vaartalap bhi karte hai or kai baar unke adeshon ko maanakar bali dene jaise kaamon ko bhi anjaam de dete hai
 a schizophrenia patient in India killed forty-one people sleeping on the roadside with an iron rod in one night and sat calmly in his house
 police ne giraftaar kar liya
 At that time, there was immense peace on the face of that patient
 kyonki yah sab usne surya bhagwaan ke nirdesh par kiya tha
 The Sun God used to talk to him every day
 yah rogi dilli kii tihaad jail main he
 Obviously just a doubt
 har kisi par, har paristhiti par or har kone se
 Other things come later
 ise psico somatic disorder kah sakate hai
 That is, mental damage is paid by mental states
 dimag ke do hisse hai
 Right and left
 in donon hisson main yaa kah den ki dimag main oxigen pahunchane ke liye laal rakt kanikaon kaa istemaal nahin hota
 There are separate oxygen carriers for this
 ye karier dimag ke pichley hisse main jaakar oxigen ko arabisi se le lete hai or phir dimag ke alag-alag hisson main chalate jate hai
 Oxygen is supplied there
 dimag ke har hisse ke liye karier pehle se tay hai
 They do not change
 ab chaahe kisi bahari chot se, kisi mental disorder se yaa vanshanugat kaarnon se ye oxigen ke vaahak bananaa band ho jate hai
 Now a part of the brain goes into a state without oxygen
 to us hisse ke neuron marane ke sandesh bhejne lagate hai
 This is called the Neer Death Experience
 maut ko bahut kareeb se dekhne vaale bahut se logon ko chamak, bhagwaan or kai tarah kii chijen dikhaai dene lagati hai
 The right brain gives birth to this imagination and the left part justifies it
 ab schijophreniya main antar yah hota he ki din ke choubees ghante, saaton din or saalon tak yah prakriya chalati he
 In this case, the patient starts doubting
 har tathy par jo saamne aata he
 It is at this stage that God sees him as the only helper and he becomes a pseudo-believer that God is talking to him or that God is in his contact
 in logon ke keval ishwar hi nahin balki anya aisi kai chizon ke prati chhadam vishwaas hota he jo aamtaur par hoti hi nahin hai
 Just as one patient thought that there are two dragons in a mirror in front of him, another patient appears as pictures on the plot wall being carried by others
 ek anya dusron par aniatik laanchhan lagata he
 The effect of all this is that only the family members of the patient misunderstand each other and start to explain the reason of the patient's disease
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki rogi or bhi akelaa pad jaataa he
 He himself is unable to decide who is in his favor and who is against him
 saalon pehle tak is rog ke bare main chikitsakon kii spasht raay nahin hone ke kaaran pehle rogi ko sandamit karne kii dawaaen di jaati raheen baad main electric shock kii sahaayta bhi lagi gai lekin ye rogi anpekshit rup se kabhi bhi thik ho jate hai or kabhi bhi gadabad
 Now when psycho somatic disorder occurs and when no one can say no
 aise main rogi kaa vyavhaar kii uske ilaj main aade aata he
 That is, to be completely manic even if we were fully restrained
 is beemaari main paariwarik sahyog ke saath saath acha ilaaj bhi milanaa chahie
 Which is most important, the more chronic the disease becomes, the more dangerous it will become
 isiilie is beemaari kaa uchit samay par pataa lagane behad jaruri ha
 If we come to know it at the right time, then its treatment is possible

 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate
 gayasuddin tululaq kii mrityu ke baad uskaa putr 'june khaan', mohammad bin tululaq ke naam se dilli kii gaddi par baitha
 Its original name was 'ulugh Khan'
 rajamundari ke ek abhilekh main mohammad tululaq ko duniya kaa khan kaha gaya he
 Probably Muhammad Tughlaq was the most educated, learned and qualified person among all the sultans of medieval times
 apni sanak bhari yojanaon, krur-krityon evam duusare ke sukh-dukh ke prati upeksha kaa bhav rakhane ke kaaran ise 'swapnsheel', 'pagal' evam 'rakt-pipaasu' kaha gaya he
 Sultans have been declared unrighteous by historians like Barani, Sirhindi, Nizamuddin, Badauni and Farishta
 singhaasana par baithne ke baad tululaq ne amiron evam saradaaron ko vibhinn oopaadhiyaan evam pad pradaan kiya
 He gave the title of 'bahram Khan' to Tatar Khan, the title of 'imad-ul-mulk' to Malik Qabool and 'wazir-e-mumalik', but later he got the title of Gujarat with the title of 'khane Jahan'
 Was created usne malik aruyaaj ko khwaja jahaan kii oopaadhi ke saath ‘shahana-e-imaarat’ kaa pad, moulana gayasuddin ko 'kutulug khaan' kii oopaadhi ke saath 'vakil-e-dar' kii padavi, apane chachere bhai firoj shah tululaq ko 'naayab barbak' kaa pad pradaan kiya tha
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was one of the most intelligent, intelligent, religious, fair-minded, art-loving and experienced commander among all the Sultans of Delhi
 vah arabi bhashaa evam farsi bhashaa kaa viddhan tathaa khagolashastra, darshan, ganit, chikitsa, vigyaan, tarkshastra aadi main paarangat tha
 Like Alauddin Khilji, at the beginning of his reign, he neither accepted his position from the Caliph nor took the support of the Ulema class, though it had to do so later
 usne nyaay vibhaag par ulema varg kaa ekadhipaty samaapt kiya
 Qazi's decision with which he was not satisfied changed it
 sarvapratham mohammad tululaq ne hi bina kisi bhedbhaav ke yogyata ke aadhaar par padon kaa aavanton kiya
 Adopted a policy of appointing officers on the basis of merit by eliminating race and class discrimination
 vastut: yah us shaasha kaa durbhaagya tha ki, uski yojanaayen safaltaapurvak kriyanvit nahin hui
 Due to which it became the subject of criticism from historians
 mohammad tululaq ke singhaasana par baithte samay dilli sultanate kul 23 praanton main banta thi, jinamein mukhya the - dilli, devgiri, lahore, multan, sarmuti, gujarat, avadh, kannauj, lakhanauti, bihar, malwa, jajanagar, dwarasamudr aadi
 Kashmir and Balochistan were also included in the Delhi Sultanate
 dilli sultanate kii seemaa kaa sarvaadhik vistaar isi ke shasankaal main hua tha
 But due to its cruel policy, rebellion started in the state
 jiske falswaroop dakshin main nae swatantra rajya kii sthapana hui or ye kshetra dilli sultanate se alag ho gaye
 Bengal also became independent
 rajarohan ke baad mohammad tululaq ne kuch naveen yojanaon kaa nirmaan kar unhen kriyanvit karne kaa praytn kiya
 like - apni pratham yojana ke dwaara mohammad tululaq ne doaab ke upjaau pradesh main kar kii vruddhi kar di, parantu usee varsh doaab main bhayankar akaal pad gaya, jisase paidaavaar prabhavit hui
 The rebellion in the area led to a rebellion by the Tughlaq officials, which failed the Tughlaq's plan
 mohammad tululaq ne krishi ke vikaas ke liye ‘diwan-e- amir kohi’ naamak ek naveen vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 Due to corruption of government employees, indifference of farmers, lack of good land, etc
, after three years, their plan for agricultural progress was terminated
 mohammad bin tululaq ne kisaanon ko bahut kam byaaj par rin uplabdh karaayaa
 Tughlaq shifted the capital from Delhi to Devgiri under his second plan
 devgiri ko “kuvvatul islam” bhi kaha gaya
 Sultan Qutubuddin Mubarak Khilji named Devagiri as 'qutbabad' and Muhammad bin Tughlaq changed its name to Daulatabad
 sultan kii is yojana ke liye sarvaadhik aalochana kii gai
 There is a great controversy among historians on the reasons for the change of capital by Muhammad Tughlaq, yet it can be concluded that, Devagiri is situated in the center of Delhi Sultanate, safe from the fear of Mongol invaders, such a stretch towards prosperity of South India etc
 There were reasons why the Sultan thought of changing the capital
 mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi purnatah asafal rahi or usne 1335 i
 main daulatabad se logon ko dilli waapas aane kii anumati de di
 The change of capital resulted in the development of Muslim culture in the South, which eventually opened the way for the rise of the Bahmani Empire
 anubhav maury Under the third plan, Muhammad Tughlaq introduced symbolic and symbolic coins
 sikke sambandhi vividh prayogon ke kaaran hi edward tamas ne use ‘dhanavaanon kaa rajkumaar’ kaha he
 Muhammad Tughlaq introduced the coin named 'dokani'
 barani ke anusaar sambhavtah sultan ne rajkosh kii riktata ke kaaran evam apni samrajya vistaar kii niti ko safal banane hetu sankethik mudra kaa prachlan karavaaya
 Under the sign currency, the sultan probably introduced coins of brass and copper metals, which were worth the rupee of silver
 sikaa dhaalane par rajya kaa niyantran nahin rahane se anek jaali taksaal ban gayi
 Lagaan was given out with fake coins, which caused the economy to collapse
 sankethik mudra chalaane kii prerana china tathaa iran se mili
 The rulers there carried out these schemes successfully, while Muhammad Tughlaq's experiment failed
 sultan ko apni is yojana kii asafalataa par bhayanak aarthik kshati kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Under the fourth plan, the Khurasan and Karachil conquests of Muhammad Tughlaq are mentioned
 khurasana ko jeetne ke liye mohammad tululaq ne 3,70,000 sainikon kii vishaal sena ko ek varsh kaa agrim vetan de diya, parantu raajnneetik parivartan ke kaaran donon deshon ke madhya samjhauta ho gaya, jisase sultan kii yah yojana asafal rahi or use aarthik rup se haani uthaani padi
 Under the Karachil campaign, the Sultan sent a large army under the leadership of Khusro Malik to conquer the hill states
 uski puri sena junglee raaston main bhatak gai, ebn batuta ke anusaar antatah keval das adhikari hi bachakar waapas aa sake
 Thus this plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed
 sambhavtah 1328-29 i
 ke madhya mongol akramanakari tarmasharin chaghtai ne ek vishaal sena ke saath bharat par akraman kar multan, lahore se lekar dilli tak ke pradeshon ko rond daalaa
 It is believed that Sultan Muhammad Tughluq returned the bribe to the Mongol leader
 It is also believed that the Mongol leader bribed the Sultan to undermine the status of the Delhi Sultan himself and similarly for the Mongol rule
 Granted
 unke bich jo bhi hua, mongol netaa ke prati is samajhote kii niti ke kaaran sultan ko aalochana kaa shikaar bananaa padaa
 It is true that after this, there was never a Mongol invasion of India during the time of Muhammad Tughluq and that because of his ambitious failed plans, Muhammad Tughluq is called the 'king of failures'
 mohammad bin tululaq ke shashan kaal main sabase adhik vidroh hue, jinamein se 27 vidroh akele dakshin bharat main hi hue
 Following is a summary of some of the important revolts during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Tughlaq - The first rebellion was in 1327 AD by Sultan Gurshasp, a cousin of Tughlaq, who was the Subedar of Sagar near Gulberg

 Prior to the advent of root-form endosseous implants, most implants were either bladed endosseous implants that looked like flattened blades in the shape of a metal piece implanted within the bone, or subperiosteal implants that had visible bone of the jaw
 An outline was made to install on and with the help of a screw with that bone Were added

 Meanwhile, an Italian doctor named Stefano Melchiad Tremonte came to mind that titanium could be used to re-establish teeth and he prepared a screw of titanium to support his own fake teeth
 In 1959 started using it on many patients in his clinic
 The good results of his clinical studies on humans were published in 1966

 He named the clinically supervised adherence of bone with titanium as 'osseointegration'
 In 1965 Brenmark, then Professor of Anatomy at Gothenburg University in Sweden, performed his first titanium dental implant in the teeth of a Swede human volunteer named Gosta Larsen
 stevens or alexander dwaara sanyukt rajya america main samakaleen swatantra shodh ke falswaroop 1969 main titanium dant pratyaropanon ke america patent ke liye filing kii gai
 Over the next fourteen years, Brenmark published several studies on the use of titanium in dental implantology; Then in 1978 he signed a commercial agreement with Swedish defense company Bofors AB for the development and marketing of his dental implants
 Nobelpharma AB was established in 1981 to focus on dental implantology with Bofors as the parent company
 ab tak 7 million se bhi adhik brinmark system implants ko sthapit kiya ja chukaa he or saikadon anya companiyaan dental implants kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Most dental implants currently available have the shape of small screws that have either thin or parallel sides
 unhen daant nikaalane ke dauraan hi daant ke kotor kii deevaaron kii haddi ke saath or kabhi-kabhi kotor ke upree sire se pare haddi ke saath bhi sthapit kiya ja saktaa he

 Practitioners typically take 2 to 6 months to recover while initial studies suggest that initial loading of the implant may not increase initial or long-term complications
 agar implant ko bahut jald lod kiya jaataa he to ho saktaa he ki implant hill jaae or vifal ho jaae
 ek nae implant ko thik hone, sambhawatah judane or antat sthapit hone main atharah maheene lag sakate hai
 Therefore many are reluctant to reduce recovery time

 In carefully selected cases, patients can be implanted in a single surgery and the procedure is named "quick loading"
 aise maamalon main haddi ke saath ekikrut hone ke dauraan implant ko sthanantarit karke kaatane kii takat se bachane ke liye asthaayee kritrim daant yaa crown ke aakaar ko thik kiya jaataa he
 There are several ways to install dental implants after tooth extraction
 ye tareeke is prakaar hai: According to the timeframe for setting up dental implants, the loading criteria can be classified into the following forms: haddiyon ko sangrakshit rakhane or ilaaj ke samay ko kam karne kii ek teji se badhati aam ranneeti main nikatatam nishkarshan sthal main danta pratyaropan kaa sthaapan shaamil he
 In addition, instant loading is becoming more common because the success rate of this process is now acceptable
 isse ilaaj ke samay main lagane vaale maheenon main katautee hoti he or kuch maamalon main dental implants ko sthapit karne ke liye kii jane vaali surgery ke dauraan hi implants ke saath banaavati daant ko bhi sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Most details suggest that the process of installing dental implants in the mucosa around and around the locations of only one root-bearing tooth with healthy bone is more effective than delayed procedures where there are no additional complications
 jab inferier alviolar canal, mental foramen or maczilari sinus sahit mahatvapurn sanrachanaon kaa sahi-sahi pataa lagane ke liye purvaparichaalanaatmak dhang se computerikrut tomography kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jise cone beam computed tomography yaa sibisiti bhi kaha jaataa he, to mulakaaton kii sankhya or intazaar main lagane vaale samay kii tarah jatiltaaon kii sambhaavnaaon main bhi katautee ho sakati he
 Cone beam CT scanning using 2% less radiation than traditional medical CT scanning achieves greater accuracy in the area of interest and is more secure for the patient

 Bone grafting will be necessary in cases where the depth or thickness from front to back; Elevation from top to bottom; And there is a lack of adequate maxillary or mandibular bone in terms of width from right to left
 jad jaise implant ke saath paryaapt haddi ko surakshit dhang se ekikrut karne ke liye teen ayaamon main inkaa hona jaruri he
 Improved bone height — which is very difficult to achieve — is particularly necessary to ensure adequate anchoring of the implant's herbal-like shape because it has to support the mechanical pressure of chewing, just like a natural tooth
 aam taur par implantologists implant ko haddi main kam se kam utani hi gaharaai main sthapit karne kii koshish karte hai jitani gaharaai main crown yaa daant haddi se upar hoga
 ise 1:1 crown se jad kaa anupaat kaha jaataa he
 This ratio sets the goal for bone grafting in most cases
 agar 1:1 yaa usase adhik praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa he to rogi ko aam taur par yah salaah di jaati he ki keval ek chota implant lagaaya ja saktaa he or us implant ke zyada dinon tak istemaal kiye jane kii ummid nahin he
 a lot of grafting materials and materials can be used during the process of bone grafting or bone replacement
 unamem rogi kii apni haddi, jise kuulhe yaa jabade kii atirikt haddi se nikaala ja saktaa he; laashon se sansaadhit haddi; gozaaty haddi yaa coral ; yaa kritrim rup se nirmit haddi jaise padaarth shaamil hote hai

 Alternatively, the bone supporting the implant can be widened like a sandwich separated by an implant placed between two halves
 ise 'rij split' prakriya ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Bone graft surgery has its own standard of care
 ek vishisht prakriya main chikitsak grapht sait par jabade kii haddi ko puri tarah se anaavruth karne ke liye masoode yaa gam ke ek bade praalamb kaa nirmaan karata he, maujuuda haddi main or us par ek yaa kai prakaar ke block or onle grapht ko pradarshit karata he, tab maukhik guha main paae jane vaale avaanchit sankraman janak microbiota ko hataane ke liye banaai gai jhilli ko sthapit karata he
 The mucosa is then carefully stitched across the site
 vyavasthit antibiotic dawaaon or samayik jeevanurodhi mukh dhulaai ek kram ke saath grapht sait ko thik hone ke liye chhod diya jaataa he
 The physician typically takes a new radiograph to confirm graft success in width and height and assumes that the positive signal in these two dimensions is safely the third dimension; In depth predicts success
 jahaan adhik sateekta kii jarurat padati he aam taur par tab jab mendibular implants kii yojana banaai ja rahi ho, vahaan uchit upachaar yojana banane ke liye nason or mahatvapurn sanrachanaon kii sthiti or haddi kii sahi maap lene ke liye is samay ek 3di yaa cone beam radiograph kii jarurat pad sakati he
 The same radiographic data can be used to prepare computer design placement guides

 To make the dental implant procedure work, there is enough bone in the jaw and the bone must be strong enough to hold and support the implant
 If there is not enough bone, more bone may need to be added with a bone graft procedure discussed earlier
 kabhi-kabhi is prakriya ko bone ogmentation bhi kaha jaataa he
 In addition, the natural teeth and supporting tissues near the implant site must be in good health
 sabhi maamalon main punarsthaapan ke antim kaaryaatmak pahaluon par dhyaan dena jaruri hota he, jaise ki implant par lagaaya jane vaala bal
 chabane or parakaarya se implant loding implant bone interphes or / yaa khud titanium saamagree kii jaivayantric sahansheeltaa bad sakati he jisase vifaltaa kaa munh dekhnaa pad saktaa he
 This can be failure of the implant itself or bone loss that is "melting" or absorption of the surrounding bone
 dentist ko sabase pehle yah nirdhaarit karnaa chahie ki kis tarah kii prosthesis kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 uske baad hi sankhya, lambaai, vyas or silaai paddati sahit vishisht implant aavashyaktaaon kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he
 In other words, the restoring dentist should plan the opposite of the case before surgery
 If the amount or density of bone is not enough, then the first bone graft process should be considered
 The restoring dentist may consult an oral surgeon, periodontist, endodontist, or another trained general dentist to treat the patient together
 aam taur par rogi ke jabade kii haddiyon or daanton ke bhautik modelon or chhaapon kaa nirmaan implant sarjan ke anurodh par restorative dentist dwaara kiya janaa chahie jiskaa istemaal upachaar yojana nirmaan ke liye bhautik sahaayta ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 If it is not supplied, the implant surgeon relies on his own or advanced computer-assisted tomography or cone beam CT scan to produce the appropriate treatment plan
 siti scan data par aadhaarit computer simulation software se antim prosthesis ke ek barium antarbharit prototip par aadhaarit virtual implant sargical placement main aasaani hoti he
 It predicts the need for bone grafting, critical anatomy, bone quality, implant characteristics by increasing the implant bone surface area for the treatment case by creating a high degree of predictability
 antim prosthesis ke antarrodh or sundarataa par aadhaarit uchit implant placement ko sahaj banane ke liye implant sarjan ke liye computer cad / cam mild yaa sterolithography aadhaarit drill guide ko viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 Treatment planning software can also be used to demonstrate "try-ins" for a patient on a computer screen
 jab vikalpon ke bare main rogi or sarjan ke bich puri tarah se vichaar-vimarsh ho jaataa he tab sateek drill gidon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye usee software kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Digital software from the patient's CBCT is used to create a treatment plan in specific software applications such as 'simplant' or 'nobelguide'
 uske baad ek data set kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he or use ek sateek in-mouth drilling guide ke nirmaan ke liye lab main bhej diya jaataa he
 The success of dental implants is related to the operator's skill, the quality and quantity of bone present on site, and the patient's oral hygiene
 aam sahmati he ki implant kii safalataa dar lagbhag 95% he
 One of the most important factors that determine implant success is the achievement and maintenance of implant stability
 sthirataa ko ek iescu maan ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 Other factors that contribute to the success of dental implant placement in most surgical procedures include overall general health of the patient and compliance with care performed after surgery
 danta pratyaropan kii vifaltaa aksar sahi tareeke se osiointegration kii vifaltaa se sambandhit hoti he
 a dental implant is considered a failure if it is destroyed, shaken, or shows more than 1

 dental implants dental kerries ke prati atisamvedansheel nahin hote hai lekin unamem peri-implantitis naamak avasthaa kaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 It is an inflammatory condition of the mucosa or bone around the implant that results in bone loss and ultimately the loss of the implant

 Excessive smokers, patients with diabetes, patients with poor oral hygiene, and peri-implantitis are more likely to occur in cases where the mucosa around the implant is thin
 filhal peri-implantitis ke behtareen ilaaj parar koi saarvbhaumik samjhauta nahin he
 This condition and its causes are still deemed unsatisfactory
 dhumrapaan karne waalon main vifaltaa kaa khatra zyada hota he
 For this reason implants are often established when the patient stops smoking because the treatment is too expensive
 surgery ke samay kharaab sthiti kii vajah se shaayad hi kabhi koi implant vifal hota he yaa shuru main overlod ho saktaa he jisaki vajah se ekikaran main vifaltaa kaa munh dekhnaa pade
 agar implant surgery se pehle smoking or sthiti sambandhi samasyaayein maujuud rahati hai to clinisian aksar rogiyon ko yahi salaah dete hai ki implant ke bajaay ek brij yaa aanshik denture iskaa ek behatar samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 Failure may also occur independently due to the reasons mentioned above
 anya kisi vastu kii tarah implants ko dard or aansu se guzarana padataa he
 If suspected implants are being installed in place of commonly used teeth, pain and tear may be encountered in the process and may break after years although this rarely occurs
 is tarah kii ghatana ke jokhim ko kam karne kaa ekmaatr tarika niyamit samiksha ke liye apane dentist se mulaaqaat karnaa he
 In most cases where the implant fails to integrate with the bone and is rejected by the body, the cause is unknown
 aisa lagbhag 5% maamalon main ho saktaa he
 To date we do not know why bone unites with dental implants of titanium and why this substance is not ruled out as an 'external object'
 pichley paanch dashakon main kai siddhanton ko nirvivaad maan liya gaya he
 a recent theory argues that the integration of bone with the implant is a lack of negative tissue response, rather than being an active biological tissue response
 duusare shabdon main agyaat kaarnon ke liye pratyaropit bahari vastuon ko asweekaar karne kii sharir kii aam pratikriya titanium implants ke saath sahi tareeke se kaam nahin karti he
 In addition, it is also undisputed that implant rejection occurs in patients whose bone tissue actually reacts as they naturally did with the 'external object' and in the same manner as the implant Rejects the manner in which it occurs with most other transcribed materials
 implant dentistory ke maamle main kuch purna nishedh-sanket hai
 However, there are some systematic, practical and physical considerations that must be evaluated
 khaas taur par mendibular implants ke liye mental foramen ke aasapaas ke kshetra main mendibular canal ke upar paryaapt alviolar haddi hona jaruri he jise inferier alviolar canal yaa iasi bhi kaha jaataa he yaa ieen kaa vahan karne vaale neurovascular bandal ke liye vaahak kaa kaam karata he)
 Failure to accurately locate the status of the IAN and MF invites surgical insertion by drills and the implant itself
 is tarah kii kshati kii vajah se nas kii apurnty kshati kaa munh dekhnaa pad saktaa he jise aksar masoode, hont or thudi kii disesthesia yaa paresthesia ke rup main mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 This condition can persist for life and with it saliva can flow from the mouth in unconscious state

 Physical considerations include the amount and height of bone present

 New information has been received about intravenous and oral bisphosphonates and certain forms of osteoporosis), which puts patients at a much higher risk of developing a delayed fitness syndrome called osteonecrosis
 nason ke andar bisphosphonats lene vaale kuch rogiyon ko implants kii salaah nahin di jaati he
 Millions of patients taking oral bisphosphonates may sometimes be advised to stop taking it before implant surgery and to start taking it again several months after surgery
 haalanki, vartmaan pramaan se pataa chalata he ki yah protocol jaruri nahin ho saktaa he
 By reviewing 115 cases with 468 implants as of January 2008, according to the report of an oral bisphosphonate study in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of February 2008, it was concluded that "osteonecrosis associated with bisphosphonate of the jaw of any patient assessed in the clinic No evidence has been found of any of the patients contacted by phone or email No symptoms reported
 american dental association ne "bisphosphonet medications and yor oral health" naamak ek lekh main bisphosphonats ke bare main bataaya tha
 In an observation, the ADA stated "the risk of developing a bone is very low in patients undergoing oral bisphosphonate therapy
 

" edie council on scientific afares ne bhi visheshgyon ke ek panel ko niyukt kiya jinhone maukhik bisphosphonats par rogiyon ke ilaaj ke liye suzav jari kiya jise june 2006 main prakashit kiya gaya
 The observation can be read online at ada
org but has now been replaced by a large study called "bisphosphonate Use and the Risk of Adversaries Who Outcomes" which covers more than 700,000 cases
 2008 ke jomes adhyayan kii tarah edie adhyayan main bhi dental implants ke liye ek nishedh-sanket ke rup main maukhik bisphosphonats ko doshamukt paaya gaya he
 Bruxism is another consideration that may reduce treatment prognosis
 bruxism ke dauraan utpann bal khaas taur par haddi ke thik hone ke dauraan implants ke liye hanikaarak hai; implant kii sthiti main sookshmasthanantaran implant kii vifaltaa kii vardhit dar se judaa hua he
 Bruxism carries the risk of implants throughout the life of the recipient
 prakritik daanton main ek periodontal ligament hota he jo har daant ko hilne-dulne kii anumati data he or lambavat or kshatij balon ke pratikriyaswaroop utpann aghat ko sahan karne main madad karata he
 Once they are replaced by dental implants, this ligament is removed and the teeth begin to support the jaw bone without moving directly
 raat main custom nirmit mouthgard ko pahanakar is samasya ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 After the installation of implants after the operation there are some physical inhibitions that encourage the rapid action of the implantology team

 The 3D cone beam X-ray obtains the required data, but even before this stage a prudent implantologist may remove the implant or remove it completely, in an attempt to restore the function of the vein, because the delay is usually Is ineffective
 3di eks-re kii sahaayta se dikhaai dene laayak saboot ke aadhaar par rogiyon ko nas ke ilaaj ke liye kisi specialist ke paas bheja ja saktaa he
 In all cases, speed of diagnosis and treatment are necessary
 sanyukt rajya america or united kingdom main, 'implantology' ke kshetra main koi anany visheshta nahin he
 Any practitioner performing implant treatment must be adequately trained in surgical insertion or final provision of prosthesis, etc
 vaidhanik prashikshan aavashyaktaaon main deshon ke aadhaar par bhinnata dekhi jaati he
 In 2008 the General Dental Council in the UK laid down strict training requirements for dentists involved in dental implantology
 euke main dental implantology ke kshetra main prashikshan kii ichha rakhane vaale kisi bhi dentist ko aupchaarik paryvekshit sargical training or mentring ke alaava ek vistrut shikshan kaarykram main bhaag lenaa jaruri he jisamen jidisi dwaara anumodith vistrut siddhant paathyakram shaamil ho

 After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, his deformed body was brought to Delhi's Palam Airport by air
 From there, his body was taken to All India Institute of Medical Sciences for autopsy and organization
 His royal act was performed on 24 May 1991
 It was disseminated at national and international level
 Many foreign leaders came from across the country to join it
 He was cremated on the banks of river Yamuna, exactly where his mother, brother, grandfather and Mahatma Gandhi were cremated

 It is also known from this report that in Jaffna, there were some coded words in the possession of the LTTE leaders, which were exchanged between the central government and the state government of the DMK party
 After reading this message later, it came to light that Rajiv was related to Gandhi's death
 In November 1998, the Congress Party dropped the United Front Government of Prime Minister IK Gujral after the report was linked
 The Congress party accused the DMK party of killing Rajiv Gandhi and demanded that the United Front be fired from the government

 In the first part, depicting the life of the common people on the pretext of the families of Bhola Pandhe street of Lahore, depicting the division of the country and the horrific communal riots arising out of it, till the refugees migrated from one country to another and forced to flee
 has gone

 The main characters of False Truth are Jaydev Puri, his sister Tara and Kanade, wife of Jayadev Puri
 tara or jayadev puri kaa ek parivaar he, kanak kaa doosraa parivaar he
 Through these two family stories, the story of the novel moves forward and becomes multidimensional in great detail
 jhootha sach kii kahani san 1947 main bharat kii aazaadee ke samay mache bhayankar dange kii prishthbhumi ke rup main buni gayi he
 British colonialism, its 'divide and rule' policy, and the Muslim League's 'two Nation Theory', combined with the low sense of untouchability present in the larger Indian society and the suppressed consciousness of communalism emerged such that the whole of India was blown away by such a blaze No other example of which could be found

 Jaidev Puri and Sood represent the example of corrupt politics as representative of regressive powers, and a woman on the path of development with revolutionary consciousness like Tara also presents a sad example of irony in the lust of happiness, prosperity and influence
 karm-karm kii rat lagane vaale pradhanmantri swayan keval bhaashan kaa sahaara lete or phijulkharchi kaa bheeshan udhaaharan prastut karte dikhte hai
 Overall, Yashpal shows that the future of the country is ultimately in the hands of the common people of the country who can see the overall situation and identify the true situation
 isiilie yashpal vibhinn sthitiyon kaa chitra ukerte hai, kisi paatr kaa ek raikhik yaa adarshavaadi chithran nahin karte hai, kyonki vyavhaarik jivan main aisa ho paanaa kamya to he, parantu bahudhaa sambhav nahin ho paata he
 In this novel, the internal weaknesses and lifelessness of the people have also been shown to be very responsible for the country's misery
 parantu, upanyaas ke ant tak jaakar yah pramanit hota he ki yah chithran vastutah vastusthiti kii sahi pahchaan karwaane ke uddeshy se hi kiya gaya he
 At the end of the novel, the corrupt but powerful leader of the Congress, Sood, loses the election and Dr

 The future of the country is not in the grasp of leaders and ministers, it is in the hands of the people of the country
 " False Truth is a large and multi-faceted novel focused on the backdrop of the Partition of India
 isamen vibhaajan ke pehle se lekar vibhaajan ke baad tak ke samay kaa baarik chitrankan kiya gaya he
 Despite keeping Jaydev Puri and his sister Tara at the center, the novel is not a hero or heroine chieftain, and as such, the novel encroaches on the pre-fabricated tie-ups
 yah upanyaas vastutah vibhinn dharmon evam virgon main bante vrihattar jan-samaaj ke utthan-patan kii suvisteern gaatha he, jiskaa chithran vibhaajan ko centre main rakhte hue kiya gaya he
 Yashpal has woven the fabric of this novel with a nuanced view of both the disintegrative sentiment arising in the minds of the people before partition and the lack of dedication and understanding necessary for the organization of the country or governance after partition
 sampradayik chetana kis prakaar maanviya niyati ko dur tak prabhavit karti he tathaa paristhitiyon kii vikat maar jansamanya main nihit krantikari chetana ko bhi kis prakaar kunthit karte hue swaarth lipsaa kii ore mode sakati he, iskaa atyant maarmik chithran yashpal ne is upanyaas main kiya he
 How the middle class of India, while criticizing the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie with revolutionary consciousness, moves towards the tragedy of living the same life itself, its novelty is worth seeing
 upanyaas kaa rachanaatmak gathan itnaa kushal he ki is mahakay upanyaas kii mahakavyatmakataa is rahasy main antarnihit maani gayi he ki iske katha-sanghatan main yah nirnay karnaa kathin ho jaataa he ki 'jhootha sach' tara kii niyati katha ke bahaane desh ke vibhaajan kaa vrittant he yaa ki desh vibhaajan ke parinaam swaroop he tara kii niyati
 In the novel, Tara herself says- "the country was divided because of my destiny or i suffered due to the fate of the country
 " Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma is considered as a staunch opponent of Yashpal, but he probably first declared that 'false Truth' is the best in Yashpal's novels
 uski ginati hindi ke naye-puraane shreshth upanyaason main hogi-- yah bhi nishchit he
 Nemichandra Jain made many accusations on this novel and concluded that even though Hindi novels are among the most important works of literature, the 'false truth' ultimately fails to touch the level of any meaningful achievement
 kavi kunwar narayan ne is upanyaas kii samiksha hi 'kavidrushti kaa abhaav' sheershak se likhi thi
 Apart from this, Anand Prakash is clear that one of the great qualities of this novel is its interestingness and excessive literacy

 According to Shivkumar Mishra the 'false truth' was widely appreciated by the readers
 us par 'akhabaari kataran' hone ke aarope bhi idhar-udhar se aaye parantu ramesh kuntal megh ne use 'kala jaisaa likhaa gaya itihaas' kah kar uski rachanaatmak prakruti kii sahi pahchaan kii
 How can a creative event of modern history be separated from history, on such a wide board? Yashpal's specialty is that he presented that history by linking it to his art form
 is upanyaas par lagaaye gayi vibhinn aaropon ke pariprekshya main ramdarsh mishra ji kaa maananaa he ki baaten bahut si he kintu mujhe lagata he ki lekhak ne tatkaaleen ghatnaon or paristhitiyon ke vistaar tathaa maanviya antar satyon kii gahanta, aadhunik niyati or mulya kaa bahut sundar saamanjasy kiya he
 It has been complained that the author's own vision in this novel is not pervasive, but i think it is a good sign for the creative vision of the writer that she travels the free world of reality, not beset by this prejudice
 is
 yah rachanaatmak drushti ek ore lekhak ko yatharth ke sahi swaroop ko dekhne ke liye prerit karti he ,duusari ore chunki yah sarjan drushti he, ghatnaon or tathyon ko jyon-kaa-tyon na dekhakar unhen maanviya satyon ke sandarbh main dekhati he or uske bheetar se kuch nirmit karti he
 Yashpal's vision in the epics presented is not left alone, he is transcendental and he knows what is false and what is not
 lekhak marxvaadi he kintu is upanyaas main uski marxvaadi vichaardhaara apane-aap main haaavee na hokar uski kalatmak drushti kii sahaayak he
 Virendra Yadav, the new in-depth critic of the novels, considered the evaluation of these giant novels to be completely inadequate and inappropriate, according to some hearsay or written notes, saying that the truth is that the false truth is just a novel work Rather, it is a classic document of Indian society and politics in the post-partition period
 kai arthon main yah bharat vibhaajan ke suparichit vimarshon va prabhutvshaalee chintan kaa pratipaksh bhi he
 The great feature of this novel is that neither it seems to be the work of the writer on the other side of the border nor of any male writer
