 History is particularly used in two ways
 ek he pracheen athwa vigat kaal kii ghatnaayen or doosraa un ghatnaon ke vishay main dharna
 The word history implies "it was sure"
 greece ke log itihaas ke liye "histari" shabd kaa prayog karte the
 "histari" literally meant "weave"
 anumaan hota he ki gyaat ghatnaon ko vyavasthit dhang se bunakar aisa chitra upasthit karne kii koshish kii jaati thi jo sarthak or susambaddha ho
 Thus the word history means anecdote group, veeragatha or historical evidence derived from tradition
 itihaas ke antargat ham jis vishay kaa adhyayan karte hai usamen ab tak ghatit ghatnaon yaa usase sambandh rakhanevaali ghatnaon kaa kalkrmanusaar varnan hota he
 In other words, history is the name of specific human events
 yaa phir pracheenta se naveenta kii ore aane vaali, maanavjaati se sambandhit ghatnaon kaa varnan itihaas he
 These events and historical evidence are proved on the basis of fact
 itihaas ke mukhya aadhaar yugavishesh or ghatnasthal ke ve avshesh hai jo kisi na kisi rup main praapt hote hai
 Due to the multifaceted pervasiveness of life, it is inauspicious to paint the past era or society with the help of self-material
 saamagree jitani hi adhik hoti jaati he usee anupaat se beete yug tathaa samaaj kii ruparekha prastut karnaa saadhy hota jaataa he
 Notwithstanding adequate means, it cannot be said that the imaginary picture will certainly be pure or true
 isliye upyukt kami kaa dhyaan rakhkar kuch vidvan kehete hai ki itihaas kii sampoornataa asaadhya si he, phir bhi yadi hamaara anubhav or gyaan prachur ho, aitihaasik saamagree kii jaanch-padtaal ko hamaari kala tarkpratishthat ho tathaa kalpana sanyat or viksit ho to ateet kaa hamaara chitra adhik maanviya or pramanik ho saktaa he
 The summary is that in the creation of history, there is a need for adequate material, scientific investigation, the discretion to understand the importance of the knowledge gained from it, as well as the power of historical imagination and the ability to depict life
 samaran rakhana chahie ki itihaas na to saadhaaran paribhaasha ke anusaar vigyaan he or na keval kaalpanik darshan athwa saahitiyik rachana he
 The history of these is formed by proper mixing
 likhit itihaas kaa aarambh padya athwa gadhy main virgatha ke rup main hua
 Then the prose started in prose with the inquiry of the hero or the specific incidents with the inquiry of the writer
 is prakaar ke lekh khapadon, pattharon, chhaalon or kapadon par milte hai
 The invention of paper paved the way for writing and reading
 likhit saamagree ko anya prakaar kii saamagree-jaise khandhar, shav, bartan, dhaatu, ann, sikke, khilone tathaa yatayaat ke sadhano aadi ke sahyog dwaara aitihaasik gyaan kaa kshetra or kosh badhata chalaa gaya
 The scientific art of investigating all that material also continued to develop
 praapt gyaan ko ko sajiv bhashaa main gunfit karne kii kala ne ascharyajanak unnati kar lee he, phir bhi ateet ke darshan ke liye kalpana kuch to abhyaas, kintu adhiktar vyakti kii naiysargik kshamta evam sookshm tathaa krant drushti par ashrith he
 Although history began in Asia, it developed exclusively in Europe
 asia main chiniyon, kintu unase bhi adhik islamic logon ko, jinako kalkram kaa mahatv achche prakaar gyaat tha, itihasarachana kaa vishesh shrey he
 Before the arrival of Muslims, Hindus had their own unique conception in history
 kalkram ke badale ve saanskrithik or dharmik vikaas yaa hraas ke yugon ke kuch mul tatwon ko ekatrit kar or vichaaron tathaa bhaawanaaon ke pravartanon or pratikon kaa sankethik varnan karke tusht ho jate the
 Their history is often found in poetic form in which all the raw material is mixed, tangled and intertwined
 uske sulajhane ke kuch-kuch praytn hone lage hai, kintu kalkram ke abhaav main bhayankar kathinaaiyaan pad rahi hai
 With the introduction of European education in the current century, historical research has started progressing in India
 itihaas kii ek nahin, sahasron dharaayen hai
 They have been widely used in political, economic and social fields
 iske sivaa ab vyaktiyon main simit na rakhkar janata tathaa uske sambandh kaa gyaan praapt karne kii ore adhik ruchi ho gai he
 Sources of history in India are: Rigveda and other Vedas like Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvaveda Granth, History Puranasamriti Granth etc
 inhen aitihaasik saamagree kehete hai
 In the West, Herodotus is considered the first historian
 itihaas kaa kshetra bada vyapak he
 Every person, subject, investigation movement, etc
 has a history, even history has a history
 atev yah kaha ja saktaa he ki darshanik, vaigyanik aadi anya drushtikonon kii tarah aitihaasik drushtikon kii apni nijee visheshta he
 It is a style of thought that permeated the civilized world from the earliest primitive times and especially from the 17th century
 19veen sadi se praaia: prayek vishay ke adhyayan ke liye uske vikaas kaa aitihaasik gyaan aavashyak samajha jaataa he
 From the study of history, the practical knowledge gained from various areas of human society provides great facility and good criterion for assessing human conditions, understanding the feelings and thoughts of individuals and the tendencies of the people, etc
 itihaas praaia: nagaron, praanton tathaa vishesh deshon ke yaa yugon ke likhe jate hai
 Now efforts and efforts are being made on this side that if possible, not only the civilized world, but only the collective development or destruction of human beings should be studied like geography
 is dhyey kii siddh yadhyapi asambhav nahin, tathaapi badi dustar he
 Its primary map conjectures that a satisfactory history of the world requires a very long time, effort, and organization
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki yadi vishwaitihaas kii tathaa manushik pravritiyon ke adhyayan se kuch sarvyaapee siddhant nikaalane kii cheshtaa kii gai to itihaas samajashaastra main badalakar apni vaiyaktik visheshta kho baithegaa
 This fear is not so worrying, because history is as much needed for sociology as history is for sociology
 vastut: itihaas par hi samajashaastra kii rachana sambhav he
 Military history deals with war, strategies, war, weapons and the psychology of war
 1970 ke dashak ke baad se "nae sainya itihaas" jo janashakti se adhik sainikon ke saath, evam ranneeti se adhik manovigyaan ke saath or samaaj or samskruti par yuddh ke vyapak prabhaav se sambandhit he
 The history of religion has been a core subject for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and is taught at seminars and academies
 agrani patrikaon main carch itihaas, catholic historical rivyuu, or dharm kaa itihaas shaamil he
 The subject broadly extends from political and cultural and artistic dimensions to theology and posthumous movement
 yah vishay duniya ke sabhi kshetron or jagahon main dharmon kaa adhyayan karata he jahaan manushya rahete hai
 Social history, sometimes called the "new social history", is an area that includes the history of ordinary people and their strategies for coping with life
 apane "swarna yug" 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main yah vidwaanon ke bich ek pramukh vishay tha, or abhi bhi itihaas ke vibhaagon main isaki acchhee paith he
 In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of American history professors along with social history increased from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%
 1980 or 1990 ke dashak main saanskrithik itihaas ne saamaajik itihaas ki jagah le lee
 It typically combines anthropological and history perspectives to look at cultural interpretations of language, popular cultural traditions, and historical experiences
 yah pichley gyaan, reeti-rivaajon or logon ke samooh ke kala ke abhilekhon or varnanaatmak vivaranon kii jaanch karata he
 How people have built up their memory of the past is a major theme
 saanskrithik itihaas main samaaj main kala kaa adhyayan bhi shaamil he, saath hi chhaviyon or maanav drishy utpaadan kaa adhyayan bhi he
 Diplomatic history focuses on relations between nations, mainly about diplomacy and the causes of war
 haal hi main yah shanti or maanav adhikaron ke kaarnon ko dekhtaa he
 It generally embodies foreign office attitudes and long-term strategic values, as the driving force for continuity and change in history
 is prakaar ke raajnneetik itihaas samay ke saath deshon yaa rajya simaaon ke bich antarrashtriya sambandhon ke sanchaalan kaa adhyayan he
 Historian Muriel Chamberlain wrote that after World War I, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the head of historical inquiry, the most historical, the most accurate, and the most sophisticated of historical studies"

 is kaaran bharat ke liye swarna padak jeetne kaa uskaa sapana bhi adhuraa rah jaataa he
 He then thinks that his son will fulfill his unfulfilled dream
 lekin uske ghar lagaataar chaar betiyon ke hone se vah niraash ho jaataa he
 Because she feels that girls should learn housework, not wrestling
 lekin jab uski badi betiyaan,gita phogot or babita phogot mil kar un par apmanjanak tippanee karne vaale ladakon ko peet kar aa jate hai to use unamem bhavishya kaa pahalwaan dikhaai detaa he
 Mahavir starts teaching both of them wrestling
 uske dwaara kathor tareekon se siikhnaa, bal chote-chote katwanaa, subah subah kasarat karnaa aadi se shuru main un ladakiyon ko apane pita ke upar bahut krodh aate rahata he, par jald hi unhen yah ehsaas ho jaataa he ki unke pita unhen keval gruhaniyon ke rup main jivan bitaane ke liye nahin balki desh ke liye kuch kar dikhaane ke liye yah sab kar rahe hai

 vah ghar laut aati he to vah uske pita ke sikhaaye takanic ke sthaan par santhaan main sikhaaye takanic se mukkebaazi karti he
 After this Mahavir and Geeta have boxing and Mahavir loses to them due to their growing age
 babita apane bahan gita se kahati he ki vah abhi jis sthaan par he, vah uske pita ke takanic ke kaaran he or use apane pita ke takanic ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 Like Geeta Babita too goes to that institution

 He keeps his nails extended and is kept colored, along with keeping his hair too long, he also has to face defeat
 use apni galati kaa ehsaas ho jaataa he or vah is baat ko mahavir ko bataati he
 Mahavir comes to his institute and starts training them both
 lekin us santhaan main prashikshan sikhaane vaale ko jab is baat kaa pataa chalata he to vah un donon ko baahar nikaalane hetu shikaayat kar detaa he
 After that it was decided that both of them can be kept in the institute only if Mahavir does not come to the institute and does not give any training to both of them
 iske baad mahavir gita ke puraane video ko dekhtaa he jisamen vah haar jaye rahati he or phone ke dwaara gita ko uske galati ke bare main bataata he
 Geeta takes part in the Commonwealth Games and Mahavir sits with the audience, contrary to his coach's instructions
 gita apane coach ke sikhaye tareekon se na lard kar apane pita ke sikhaaye tareekon se ladati he or har baar jeet jaati he
 That coach starts jealous of Mahavir and for this reason he locks Mahavir in a room
 mahavir ke anupasthiti main bhi gita swarna padak jeet jaati he or bharat kii pehali mahila pahalwaan ban jaati he, jisane swarna padak jeeta
 Mahavir comes out at the right time and the coach is unable to take his credit in front of the news media
 iske baad film ke ant hone se thodaa pehle dikhaaya jaataa he ki babita bhi komanwealth khel 2014 main swarna padak jeet jaati he or gita pehali mahila mukkebaaz banati he jo olympix main hissaa leti he

 vahaan ek vidhyaarthee ne ek plate ko phenkaa
 The plate was white in color and had a red colored symbol of the Cornel in the middle

 It was a strange sight
 finemen iske dagamagane or ghoomane or ke bich main sambandh dhudhane lage
 It used to be very difficult mathematical equations
 isame unka bahut samay laga
 They found that both have a relation of 2: 1
 unke saathiyon ne unase kaha ki vah isame samay kyon bekaar kar rahe hai
 His answer was, 'iskaa koi mahatv nahin he main yah sab mouj masti ke liye kar rahaa hum
 ' par vah iske mahatv ke bare me thik nahin the
 When he started researching about the rotation of the electrons, he again remembered the mathematics in the staggered and rotating plate of the Cornel

 True, there is a lot in life that is necessary only for fun, whether it has any other importance or not - leisure fun is a matter of importance in its own right
 yadi aap mouj masti main hi apni jeevika dhurh sake to kya baat he, yadi yah nahin ho saktaa to shaayad jeevika main hi mouj masti dhurh paanaa duusari acchhee baat he
 Fineman was not only a great scientist but also a great teacher
 unhe malum tha ki apni baat duusare tak kaise pahunchaayi jaay
 The lecture hall was a theater for them, which also had drama and fireworks
 finemen ke dwaara bhautik shaastra par cyle-tech ke lekcharon kaa zikr maine is lekh ko shuruwat me kiya he
 He gave these lectures in September 1961-may 1963
 yah lacture khaas the isaliye inhen hameshaa ke liye surakshit rakhaa gaya or baad me ye teen laal kitabon ke rup main chaape gayi
 The finemen used to give only two lectures a week, the rest of the time he used to prepare these lectures

 There were never lecture notes with him
 bas keval ek chota sa kaagaj rahata tha jisamen aage bataane ke liye kuch khaas shabd keval sanket dene ke liye rahete the
 These three years are unique in lectures on any subject, in any university in the world
 na kabhi aise huye na shaayad phir kabhi honge
 Because i do not know if such a person will come again
 finemen ke liye angreji - bekaar or darshan shaastra - tiraskrit vishay tha
 He had nothing to do with Religion
 chakkaron par baat karnaa unki phiza main nahin tha
 He always spoke directly
 unka matlab vahi hota tha jo ve kehete the
 They would get confused if their direct talk disturbed the other
 finemen ko log alag alag tarah se yaad rakhte hai - kuch log, Probably the most people remember him as the person who publicly told TV why the Challenger-accident happened
 28 janvari 1986 main chalanger spesship kaa visphot akaash main ho gaya tha, isaki jaanch karne ke liye ek kamishan baitha
 Finemen were in it as a scientist
 yah visphot, spesship main kuch ghatiya kism kaa saamaan lagane ke kaaran hua tha
 nasa's administration wanted to suppress it but scientists wanted to uncover it
 kamishan ne apane nishkarsh ko tivi ke saamne sidhe prasaaran me bataanaa shuru kiya 
 At that time on TV itself, in front of everyone, the finemen put substandard stuff inside cold water and showed why the explosion actually happened
 yah sidhaa prasaaran tha isaliye finemen kaa pradarshan roka nahin ja sakaa or yah do minute kii clip kuch ghanto ke andar duniya kii tivi par sabase zyada dikhaayi jane vaali news clip ban gayi
 Finemen often went to a restaurant in Passadina, where topless restaurants lived
 us restaraan main ve uske maalik ko bhautik shaastra bataate the or vah unhe chitrakaari
 Once, the police felt that something was wrong in the restaurant and prosecuted the restaurant owner for obscenity
 vastav main vahaan par is tarah kaa koi kaary nahin hota tha
 Many eminent people used to come to that restaurant
 The owner of the restaurant prayed to give them the most testimony
 sabane chuppe se kanni kaat lee, par finemen ne nahin
 He testified in favor of the restaurant owner and the next day appeared on the front page of newspapers as the most prominent news item

 Dr
 Pitamberdutt Barthalwal d
litt in Hindi
 Was the first researcher to receive the degree of
 unhone anusandhan or khoj parampara kaa pravartan kiya tathaa acharya ramchandra shukla or babu shyamsundar das kii parampara ko aage badhaate hue hindi aalochana ko majbootee pradaan kii
 He put forward the development oriented style by making the language more capable for the expression of feelings and thoughts
 apni gambhir adhyayanshiltaa or shodh pravriti ke kaaran unhone hindi main pratham di
lit
 hone kaa gaurav praapt kiya
 The birth and death of Barathwal ji, who drew the light of inspiration from the research trend on the plank of Hindi literature, both took place in village "pali" near Lens Down Zone in Garhwal region of Uttarakhand
 badthwalji ne apni saahitiyik chhavi ke darshan bachapan main hi kara diye the
 He started writing poems under the name 'ambar' during childhood
 kishoravastha main pahunchakar unhone kahani lekhan prarambh kar diya
 Two of his stories were published in Purushartha in 1918
 kanpur main apane chaatr jivan ke dauraan hi unhone 'hillman' naamak angreji masik patrika kaa sampadan karte hue apni sampadakeey pratibha ko bhi pradarshit kiya
 At the time when literary consciousness was awakened in Barathwalji, there were many challenges before Hindi
 kathin sangharshon or prayatnon ke baad ucch kakshaon main hindi ke pathan-pathan kii vyavastha to ho gai thi, lekin hindi sahitya ke gahan adhyayan or shodh ko koi thos aadhaar nahin mil paaya tha
 Creators like Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Babu Shyam Sundar Das were active in the field of criticism
 badthwalji ne is paridrishy main apni anveshnatmak kshamta ke sahare hindi kshetra main shodh kii sudrudh parampara kii neenv daali
 The new beliefs established in the context of saint literature revealed his research potential
 unhone pehali baar sant, sidgh, nath or bhakthi sahitya kii khoj or vishleshan main apni anusandhanatmak drushti ko lagaaya
 Unlike Shukla ji, he proved the Bhakti movement not to be the result of the disappointment of the Hindu caste, but proved it to be a natural development of the Bhakti stream
 is sandarbh main likhe unke shodh lekh unke gambheer adhyayan or manan ke saath-saath unki moulik drushti ke bhi parichaayak hai
 Later writers based their literary beliefs on the basis of analysis
 unhone swayan kaha, 'bhashaa falti phoolati to he sahitya main, ankurit hoti he bolchaal main, saadhaaran bolchaal par boli manj-sudharkar saahitiyik bhashaa ban jaati he
 'in this way, in the style he adopted for emotionalism, his main focus was on language
 unhone sanskrit, avadhi, brajabhasha, arabi evam farsi ke shabdon ko khadiboli ke vyakaran or uccharan main dhalkar apanaaya
 Barathwalji would surely have created a vast literature, if he had come with a long life
 da sampoornanand ne thik hi kaha he,'yadi aayu ne dhokhaa na diya hota to ve or bhi gambhir rachanaaon kaa sarjan karte
 'in the short term, he will always be remembered for the strong foundation of study and research
 babu shayamsundar das ke nirdesan main agreji main likhe unke shodh prabandh 'da nirgun skool of hindi poetry' par kaashi vishavidhyalay ne unhen dilitaki oopaadhi pradaan kii
 That dissertation was strongly welcomed in the Hindi literature world
 use bhuri - bhuri prashansa mili
 Dr
 Ranade, Professor of Philosophy of Prayag University, expressed his opinion on this and said that 'this is an important gift not only for the discussion of Hindi literature but also for philosophical interpretation of mysticism
 ' baad main yah shodh prabandh 'hindi main nirgun sampradaay' naam se hindi main prakashit hua
 In the Hindi world, Barthwalji made an identity due to his research attitude and review vision, but his essayists saw the flourishing of his essay art in reflective essays like 'kaneripav' 'gangabai' 'nature of worship in Hindi literature', 'kavi Keshavdas'' Roop also found a lot of appreciation in the Hindi world
 unki prakashit kritiyon main -'yoga pravaah', 'makrand', da peetambardutt badthwaal ke shreshth niabandh' aadi hai
 He compiled and edited the works of poet Gorakhnath which was published under the name 'gorakh Bani'
 hindi ke atirikt angreji main bhi unhone kuch shreshth saahitiyik niabandh likhe, jinamein - misticism in hindi poetry' or'misticism in kabir' vishesh ullekhneey hai
 The peculiarity of Baratwalji's essays is that the essence of the essay becomes clear in the beginning
 niabandh ke praarambhik vaakya rochak prastaavna kii tarah ubharate hai
 Then the writer goes down into the depth of the subject
 taarkik dhang se vishay saamagree ko sajaakar vah pathak ko lubhaate hue bady rochakata or jigyaasa ke saath vishay ke nishkarsh tak pahunchaata he
 In addition to research articles and essays, he expressed his interest in Naturopathy and Yoga system by writing books like 'pranayam Vigyan and Kala' and 'meditation with self-healing'
 gadhwali lok-sahitya kii taraf bhi unka gaharaa rujhaan tha
 He also translated 'king Arthur and Nights of the Rowd Table' into Hindi for children
 shodhakarta or nibandhkaar ke saath-saath badthwalji apni darshanik pravratti ke liye bhi vikhyath the
 He based his studies on spiritual creations
 unhone dharm, darshan or samskruti kii vivechna kii
 His entire writing is the result of his deep learning
 kaha jaataa he ki mastishk kii daastaa unke swabhaav ke vipareet thi
 He was seen writing several times before each line was published
 1601 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1601 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- On the basis of the above difference, according to 1601 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 sanvahan ooshmaa ke sthaanantaran yaa sancharan kii ek vidhi he kisi taral padaarth main anuon ke samgr sthaanantaran dwaara ooshmaa kaa len-dein hota he
 Conduction is not possible in solids, but in liquids, convection is one of the main methods of transfer of heat

 This transfer of mass by convection causes heat transfer

 State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00720 khagolashastra main jowarbandhan us sthiti ko kehete hai jab apni kaksha main parikrama karti hui kisi khagoleey vastu or uske gurutvkarshak saathi ke bich koniya samveg kii adla-badali nahin hoti
 Ordinarily in that case, that object keeps one face towards its partner
 iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan prithvi kaa chandramaa he jo prithvi ke saath jowarbandh he or prithvi kii taraf uskaa ek hi mukh rahata he, jis kaaran se prithvi se uskaa keval ek hi mukh dikhataa he or uskaa ulta mukh dekhne ke liye prithvi chhodkar antariksh yaan se chandramaa ke peeche janaa hota he
 When an object revolves around another object, they exert a force of tidal force on each other, which gradually increases their rotation period and the two periods of the orbital period, and eventually becomes tidal
 yah chote aakaar kii vastu main tezi se or bade aakaar kii vastu main dhire-dhire hota he
 This is why the Moon has a tidal current with the Earth, but the Earth is not yet with the Moon
 jab donon vastuon kaa aakaar ek-duusare ke sameep ho to donon main hi jowarbandh utpann ho jaataa he
 Such is the case between Pluto and its satellite Sharon - the same face of Pluto is always stuck face to face with the same face of Sharon
 jowarbandh grahon par jivan utpann hone kii sambhaawanaaon par khagolashastriyon main kaafii vivaad chal rahaa he
 In such situations when the orbit is decentralized and the tidal effect is weak, the small object, instead of a direct ligation, may come in a rotating-orbit resonance
 isamen us vastu ke ghurnan kaal or uski kakshiya avadhi ke bich ek saral anupaat dekha jaataa he
 For example, the rotation period of the planet Mercury and the orbital period of its orbit around the sun have a resonance of 3: 2

 In addition, he invites foreign climbers to the area and outsiders for scientific tests, even when it is not his area

 The incident we are specifically mentioning here is from the year 1987
 isamen pakistan ne siachin glacier par, bhartiya seemaa ke andar apni ek chaowkee banane kaa aadesh apni senaaon ko de diya
 The place was also reserved from India, given the weather
 vahaan par pakistan sainikon ne apni chaowkee khadi kii or 'kaayad chaowkee' kaa naam diya
 The name was named after the father of Pakistan quaid-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah
 us chaowkee kii sanrachana samajhnaa bhi bada rochak he
 The outpost was built like a fort above the glacier, with walls of snow 1500 feet high on either side
 ise pakistan ne apni yah chaowkee 'kaayad' badi chunauti kii tarah, bharat kii seemaa ke bheetar banaai thi, jise atikaraman ke alaava koi or naam nahin diya ja saktaa
 Obviously, it was not possible for India to sit silent on the information of this incident
 bhartiya sena ne yah prastaav banaaya ki hamen is chaowkee ko vahaan se hataakar us par apana kabja kar lenaa he
 In response to this proposal, Naib Subedar Bana Singh himself went ahead and said that he will go and complete this work

 They were allowed to do this
 naayab soobedaar bana singh ne apane saath chaar saathi or liye or apane lakshya kii ore bad liye
 According to the plan, the other battalions continued to confuse the soldiers of Pakistan's enemy and on the other hand Bana Singh and his comrades started the work of reaching that outpost

 The guns were also not working properly due to the severe cold

 On the way, he also saw the bodies of those Indian bravehearts who lost their lives on the way to reach here
 jaise-taise bana singh apane saathiyon ko lekar thik upar tak pahunchne main kaamyaab ho gayi
 Arriving there, he divided his team into two parts and deployed them in two directions and then started throwing grenades at that 'qaid post'
 vahaan bane banksron main grenade ne apana kaam dikhaaya
 Simultaneously the soldiers of the other party started killing the enemy soldiers who were at the checkpoint from the benets
