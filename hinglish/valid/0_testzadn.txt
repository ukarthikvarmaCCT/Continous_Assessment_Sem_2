 In 1991, Anna Hazare went on hunger strike demanding the removal of some 'corrupt' ministers of the Shiv sena-bjp government in Maharashtra
 ye mantri the- shashikant sutar, mahadev shivankar or baban gholap
 Anna accused him of possessing disproportionate assets
 sarkaar ne unhen manaane kii bahut koshish kii, lekin antat: unhen daagi mantriyon shashikant sutar or mahadev shivankar ko hataanaa hi padaa
 Gholap filed a defamation suit against Anna

 The then Chief Minister Manohar Joshi released him after a day's detention

 But Anna Hazare also accused many Shiv Sena and BJP leaders of indulging in corruption
 1997 main anna hajaare ne soochna kaa adhikaar adhinium ke samarthan main mumbai ke aaazaad maidan se apana abhiyaan shuru kiya
 On 9 August 2003, Anna Hazare sat on fast unto death at Azad Maidan in Mumbai
 12 din tak chale aamaran anshan ke dauraan anna hajaare or soochna kaa adhikaar andolan ko deshvyapee samarthan mila
 Eventually, in 2003, the Maharashtra government had to pass a strong and stringent bill of the Act
 baad main isi andolan ne rashtriya andolan kaa rup le liya
 As a result, on 12 October 2005, the Indian Parliament also passed the Right to Information Act
 agast 2006, main soochna kaa adhikaar adhinium main sanshodhan prastaav ke khilaaf anna ne 11 din tak aamaran anshan kiya, jise deshbhar main samarthan mila
 As a result of this, the government changed the intent of the amendment
 2003 main anna ne congress or ensipi sarkaar ke chaar mantriyon; suresh dada jain, nawab malik, vijay kumaar gavit or padmasingh patil ko bhrasht bataakar unke kilaaf muhim ched di or bhukh hadtaal par baith gaye

 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 On August 16, at seven thirty in the morning, as they were preparing to go on hunger strike, the Delhi Police arrested them from home
 unke team ke anya log bhi giraftaar kar liye gaye
 This news aroused the general public and she took to the streets and started non-violent resistance to this move of the government
 dilli police ne anna ko magistrate ke saamne pesh kiya
 On being released, Anna refused to move out of Delhi to Ralegaon or to fast for 3 days
 unhen 7 dinon ke nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail bhej diya gaya
 News of the countrywide protests by evening forced the government to pull back
 dilli police ne anna ko sashart reeha karne kaa aadesh jari kiya
 But Anna was determined to continue the fast
 bina kisi shart ke anshan karne kii anumati tak unhone reeha hone se inkaar kar diya
 Till August 17, there was a demonstration in the country in support of Anna

 By the evening of 17 August, Delhi Police agreed to allow 7 days of hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan

 He continued his fast in jail
 anna ko ramlila maidan main 15 din ki anumati mili or 19 agast se anna ram lila maidan main jan lokapal bill ke liye anshan jari rakhane par drudh the
 Till 24 August, there was no agreement with the government on three issues
 anshan ke 10 din ho jane par bhi sarkaar anna kaa anshan samaapat nahin karvaa pai | hajaare ne das din se jari apane anshan ko samaapt karne ke liye saarvajanik taur par teen sharton kaa elaan kiya
 He said that all government employees should be brought under the purview of Lokpal, a citizen charter should be imposed in all government offices and there should be a Lokayukta in all states
 74 varshiya hajaare ne kaha ki agar jan lokapal vidheyak par sansad charchaa karti he or in teen sharton par sadan ke bheetar sahmati ban jaati he to vah apana anshan samaapt kar denge
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, taking the first concrete initiative to break the impasse between the two sides, made an open offer in the Lok Sabha that the Parliament would also consider the Jan Lokpal Bill along with the Bills introduced by others including Aruna Roy and Dr
 Jayaprakash Narayan
 uske baad vichaar vimarsh kaa byora sthaayee samiti ko bheja jayega
 On 25 May 2012, Anna Hazare again conducted a daylong fast on Jantar Mantar with the Jan Lokpal Bill and Whistle Blower Bill

 After Mahatma Gandhi, Anna Hazare has used hunger strike and fast unto death as the most frequent weapon
 iske jariye unhone bhrasht prashasan ko pad chhodane evam sarkaron ko janhitkaari kanoon banane par majaboor kiya he
 Anna Hazare can also be called the Gandhi of the modern era
 anna hajaare ham sabhi ke liye adarsh he
 Anna Hazare considers Gandhiji's village Swarajya as the medium of prosperity in the villages of India
 unka maananaa he ki 'balashaali bharat ke liye gaanvon ko apane pairon par khadaa karnaa hoga
 According to him, the reason for not being equally distributed in the development of the villages was not to keep the villages at the center

 Giving the basic mantra for creation of the person, he has called upon the youth to develop good character, pure ethics, clean life and a sense of sacrifice and imbibed fearlessness and accept the service of common man as an ideal

 elliod yaa eliyad — pracheen unani shastreey mahakavy he, jo europe ke adikavi homer kii rachana maani jaati he
 It is named after the battle of the city of Ilion
 samgr rachana 24 pustakon main vibhakt he or isamen 15,693 panktiyaan hai
 The Iliad describes the Greek Longo's war with the kingdom of Troy
 is mahakavy main try ke vijay or dhwans kii kahani tathaa unani vir eklis ke virtv kii gaathaayen hai
 In a nutshell, the story of this epic is as follows: Paris, the son of Priam King of Ilion, abducted the supreme beauty Helen, the wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta, in the absence of her husband
 hellen ko pun: praapt karne tathaa ilian ko dand dene ke liye menelouse or uske bhai aagaamemnan ne samast greek raajaaon or saamanton kii sena ekatra karke ilian ke viruddh abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 But this poem does not have a direct description of the above mentioned reasons and its end result, ie the destruction of the Ilion
 iskaa aarambh to greek shivi main kavy ke nayak ekiles ke rosh se hota he
 Agamemnon has rapefully kept the daughter of the priest of Suryadev Apollo
 parinamat: greek shivi main mahamari faili hui he
 The prophet Kalkus stated that the epidemic would not stop until the daughter of the priest was returned
 agamemnan badi kathinaayee se iske liye prastut hota he par iske saath hi vah badale main ekilies ke paas se ek duusari beti briseis ko chin letaa he
 Angry and angry at this insult, vows not to fight in the war
 vah apni mirmidan sena or apane mitra patroklas ke saath apane deron main chalaa jaataa he or kisi bhi manuhaar ko nahin sunata
 As a result, Agamemnon's side in the war begins to grumble
 greek sena bhagkar apane shivi main sharan leti he
 Constrained by the circumstances, Agamemnon sends his messengers to the Achilles and agrees to do much to alleviate his fury
 parantu ekilies kaa rosh dur nahin hota or vah duusare din apane ghar laut jane kii ghoshnaa karata he
 But in fact he stays to see the plight of Agamemnon's army
 kintu uskaa mitra patroklas apane paksh kii is durdasha ko dekhakar ko dekhakar khiz uthta he or vah ekilies se yuddh main ladane kii ajna praapt kar letaa he
 The Achilles also give him his armor and send his Miramidan soldiers to battle with him as well
 patroklas ilian kii sena ko khaded detaa he par swayan ant main vah ilian ke maharathi hektar dwaara maar daalaa jaataa he
 Hearing the news of the death of Patroclus, Echilles is mad with grief and anger and after entering into a new armor with Agamemnon, enters the battlefield to avenge his friend from Hektor
 ekilies se yuddh aarambh karte hi pasa palat jaataa he
 He kills Hektor and drags his body into the battlefield by tying his leg to the back of his chariot, causing his head to roll in the gully
 iske pashchaat patroklas kii antyeshti bade thaat baat ke saath kii jaati he
 Echilius brings Hektar's body to his camp and decides to dissect his body and feed it to the dogs
 hektar kaa pita ilian raja prium uske shivi main apane putr kaa shav praapt karne ke liye upasthit hota he
 His mourning reminds Achilles of his father and his anger goes away, and he, overwhelmed by compassion, gives the body of Hektar to his father and at the same time the war is halted for 12 days
 hektar kii antyeshti ke saath eliyad kii samaapti ho jaati he
 In some handwritten copies, a line at the end of Iliad suggests that after the funeral of Hektar, a woman named Amazon came to the aid of Pantheilia Priam, queen of warriors
 isi sanket ke aadhaar par smarna ke quintus naamak kavi ne 14 pustakon main eliyad kaa poorak kavy likhaa tha
 In modern times, Shri Arvind Ghosh also in the evening of his life had started the creation of Iliyad in English in a mere circle, which could not be completed
 navam pustak kii rachana ke madhya main hi unki chirsmadhi kii uplabdhi ho gai
 The era whose events are mentioned in Iliyad is called Veerayuga
 shliman or defelt ko try nagar kii khudaai ke pashchaat is yug kii satyata nirvivaad siddh ho chuki thi
 BC The 13th and 13th centuries are considered the era of this era

 Problems related to Homer's compositions are extremely complex
 ek samay homer ke astitv tak par andeh kiya jane laga tha
 But now the situation has become more favorable, although Homer's epics are still considered the culmination of a development in which the skill of a extraterrestrial genius is clearly targeted
 eliyad main mahakavy kii drushti se saralata or kavikarm kaa abhootpurv saamanjasy he
 From the point of view of policy, the performance of extraordinary work and the devastating result of anger, as happened in this poem, will be difficult to find elsewhere
 iske purush paatro main agamemnan, ekilies, patroklas, menelouse, prium, paris or hektar ullekhneey hai
 Among the female characters, Helen, Hecuba, Andromaco, etc
 are great
 yuddh main manushya or devtaa sabhi bhaag lete hai, kahin manushya gunon main devataaon se unche uth jate hai to kahin devtaa log maanviya durbalataaon ke shikaar hote drushtigochar hote hai evam parihaas ke paatr banate hai
 a number of Iliad corresponds with the Indian epics, including Helen's abduction and Ilean's combustion having a clear resemblance to sita-haran and Lanka
 sambhavat: isi kaaran megasthaneez ko bharat main homer ke mahakavyon ke astitv kaa bhram hua tha
 Homer's translations are numerous, but his translation, as in every high-quality translation of the original work, is a problem
 yadi anuvadak saralata par drushti rakhata he to homer ke kavitv ko ganvaa baithta he or kavitv ko pakadana chahta he to saralata kafoor ho jaati he
 This epic has been translated into every language of Europe
 padya or gadhy donon main anek anuwaad hue hai
 There have also been translations of both 'iliad' and 'odyssey' in many Indian languages
 bangla main ek se adhik anuwaad ho chuke hai

 In astrology, one of the methods which is used to know the time of getting the result is Vanishoti Dasha
 Maharshi Parashar is considered to be the father of Vinasottari Dasha
 parashar muni dwaara banaai gayi vinshottaree vidhi chandra nakshatra par aadhaarit he
 The prediction made by this method is considered to be accurate, so astrologers have been relying on this method for years and have been predicting it
 dakshin bharat main jyotishi vishottaree ke badale ashtottaree vidhi kaa bhi prayog kar rahe hai parantu, vishottaree paddati zyada lokapriy evam maanya he
 The Mahadasha and Nakshatra of the planets are as follows vinshottaree dasha main grahon kaa fal gyaat karne ke sambandh main maharishi parashar evam varahamihir ne ek niyam yah bataaya he ki lagn ke anuroop kuch grah naiysargik rup se shubh hote hai jaise mesh lagn ke liye shani mangal, vrish lagn ke liye shani, kanya lagn ke liye budh tathaa kark lagn ke liye mangal
 Despite the planet being auspicious for the lagna, it is important to keep in mind how strong that planet is in the horoscope

 syadawaad jain darshan ke antargat kisi vastu ke gun ko samajhane, samajhane or abhivyakt karne kaa saapekshik siddhant he
 According to Jainism, any thing has eternal qualities
 mukt yaa kaivalya praapt sadhak ko hi anant gunon kaa gyaan sambhav he
 Knowledge of ordinary humans is partial and relative
 vastu kaa yah aanshik gyaan hi jain darshan main nay kehalaata he
 There are different approaches to understanding any object
 ye nay satya ke aanshik rup kahe jate hai
 With partial and relative knowledge only the attainment of relative truth is possible, not the attainment of absolute truth
 saapeksh satya kii prapti ke kaaran hi kisi bhi vastu ke sambandh main saadhaaran vyakti kaa nirnay sabhi drushtiyon se satya nahin ho saktaa
 The reason for differences between people is that they start to consider their views as very true and ignore the views of others
 vichaaron ko taarkik rup se abhivyakt karne or gyaan kii saapekshata kaa mahatv darshane ke liye hi jain darshan ne syadawaad yaa saptabhangi nay kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya he
 In order to make sense of relative knowledge, the use of Syatvada has been instructed at the beginning of every new in Jain philosophy
 yahan dhyaan rakhana chahie ki 'syat' kaa arth 'shaayad' nahin he
 Jains exemplify this through an elephant and six blind persons
 sabhi netraheen gyaan kii uplabdhta or us tak pahunch kii seemaa kaa bodh karaate hai
 If one tells an elephant on the basis of limited experience that an elephant is told like a pole, rope, wall, python or fan, then it only expresses its partial knowledge and relative truth
 yadi isi anubhav main 'syat' shabd jod diya jaay to mat dosharahit mana jaataa he
 That is, if it is said - 'symbol elephant is like a pole or rope', then the vote would be considered logically correct
 saapekshik gyaan kii taarkikta ke aadhaar par jain darshan main nirnay yaa mat ke saat prakaar maane gayi hai
 This classification of empirical judgment or opinion by Jain philosophy is called Saptabhangi Nay
 yah pehla mat he
 For example, if it is said that 'the elephant is like a pillar', it would mean that in a particular country, time and situation, the elephant is like a pillar
 yah mat bhavatmak he
 This is the right thing
 isame koi shaq nahi he
 This is a negative opinion
 is pariprekshya main hathi ke sambandh main mat is prakaar hona chahie ki- syat hathi is kamare ke bheetar nahin he
 This does not mean that there are no elephants in the room
 syat shabd is tathy kaa bodh karaata he ki vishesh rup, rang, aakaar or prakaar kaa hathi is kamare ke bheetar nahin he
 In the realization of which the elephant is like a wall or rope, this new form is used as a negative opinion
 syat shabd se us hathi kaa bodh hota he jo mat diye jane ke samay kamare main upasthit nahin he
 This view means that the power of the object may or may not be from a particular point of view
 hathi ke udhaaharan ko dhyaan main rakhen to vah khambhe ke samaan ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi ho sakati he
 In such circumstances only 'siyat hai and not Siyaat' can be used
 yadi kisi mat main paraspar virdohi gunon ke sambandh main ek saath vichaar karnaa ho to us vishay main syat avaktavyam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
