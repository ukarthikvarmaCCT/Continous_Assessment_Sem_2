 jameendaari pratha bharat main mughal kaal evam british kaal main prachlit ek rajnatik-saamaajik kuriti thi jisamen bhoomi kaa swaamitv us par kaam karne waalon kaa na hokar kisi or kaa hota tha jo kheti karne waalon se kar vasuulate the
 This practice was abolished after India became independent
 bharat kii pracheen vichaardhaara ke anusaar bhoomi saarvajanik sampatti thi, isaliye yah vyakti kii sampatti nahin ho sakati thi
 Land, like air, water and light, was considered a gift of nature
 maharishi jaimini ke matanusaar "raja bhoomi kaa samarpan nahin kar saktaa tha kyonki yah uski sampatti nahin varan maanav samaaj kii sammilit sampatti he
 That is why everyone has equal rights over it "
 manu kaa bhi spasht kathan he ki "rishiyon ke matanusaar bhumiswamitv kaa pratham adhikaar use he jisane jangal katkar use saaf kiya tha jota" 
 Therefore, in a very large part of ancient India, the head of the village was elected by the village community and he was appointed with the consent of the state
 rajya use bhoomikar na dene par hataa saktaa tha, yadhyapi yah pad vanshanugat tha tathaa isaki prapti ke liye janamat tathaa rajyasweekruti aavashyak thi
 Therefore, those who are not elected were different from present-day landlords
 pracheen bharat main bhoomi kaa sampatti ke rup main krayvikray sambhav nahin tha
 This fact has also been confirmed by Western scholars Baden Powell and Sir George Campbell
 campbell kaa kathan he ki bhoomi jotane kaa adhikaar ek adhikaar maatr hi tha or hindu vyavastha ke anusaar bhoomi nahin mana gaya tha
 It has been known by modern research that in ancient India, there were feudatories, overheads, bhogikas, Pratiharas and Dandanayaks
 ye log newnaadhik samantpratha ke anukool the
 But we have not been sure about their rights and duties, except that these people used to send troops to their owners when needed
 in adhikariyon ko paarishramik ke rup main bhoomi pradaan kii jaati thi
 According to Yajnavalkya regarding the land system, there were four classes, Mahipati, Kshetraswami, Krishak and Shikami
 acharya brihaspati ne kshetraswami ke sthaan main keval swami shabd kaa hi prayog kiya he parantu iskaa spashtikaran kar diya he ki swami, raja or khetihar ke madhya kaa varg tha
 The above description only indicates the classification of land holdings, and not to bring the farmer to the level of an Anglo slave
 mukhya prashn to yah he ki bhoomi par swatv adhikaar kisko - rajya ko, krishak ko athwa kisi madhyavarti varg ko vidwaanon ke matanusaar pracheen bharat main yah adhikaar hi tha jo swatv adhikaar nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We do not find any transformation in this ancient land during Yavana rule and neither is there any change in the basic principles of land-rights
 yavan shaasha bhoomikar gaanv ke mukhiya dwaara hi vasuul karte the or kabhi-kabhi sthaneey saradaaron vaa raajaaon dwaara, jo apana str gaanv ke mukhiya se unchaa hone kaa daawa karte the
 The claim of these kings appears to have produced an intermediate class between the state and the cultivator
 parantu samantvaad pad avrodh sthaayee rakhaa gaya tha kyonki rajya sarvada in raajaaon ko karmchaaree hi maanate the
 Although these kings were beginning to be hereditary, the state always had the right to grant and take back their post
 ek raja ke uttaradhikari ko raja kii sanad praapt karne ke liye prarthanapatr dena padataa tha or sanad kii prapti ke pashchaat hi vah raja hota tha
 In the Ainacabari, no intermediate class is recognized between the farmer and the state
 tathakthith raja or jameendaar saidhantik or vaastavik rup main keval kar vasuul karanevaale karmchaaree hi the
 It is notable that the Yavana rulers never claimed land-ownership-rights
 yah baat in aitihaasik tathyon se spasht he ki aurangzeb ne hundi, palam tathaa anya sthanon par krishakon se bhoomi kharidi thi, jaisaa akbar ne akbarabad or elahabaad main kile banane ke liye kiya tha
 Shah Jahan also did the same, it is proved from the above evidence that the Yavana rulers believed in property rights only in collecting taxes and not in the land
 unke shasankaal main krishak ke adhikaron ko ucchtam manyata di gai thi
 The farmer used to give it by the king and the head of the village and the king and the chief received remuneration for this work by the state
 san 1707 i0 main aurangzeb kii mrityu ke pashchaat krishakon ke adhikaron kaa lop dhire-dhire aarambh hua jab ki kendriya satta shithil padane lagi
 The sentiment of semi-feudal selfishness emerged during this time of monopoly
 jab rajya kii satta shithil padane lagi, rajya ke karmchaaree praja ke janmaal kii raksha karne main asamarth hone lage
 As a result, the villagers began to take the help of powerful employees and kings or chiefs for the protection
 in logon ne swabhaavat: sharnaarthi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron par akraman kiya
 Under these conditions, seedlings of Zamindari system are found
 parantu is sankatkaal main bhi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron kaa purna samarpan nahin hua tha
 Zamindari system started to emerge from the arrival of British in India
 angrej shaskaon kaa vishwaas tha ki ve bhoomi ke swami hai or krishak unki praja hai isaliye unhone sthaayee tathaa asthaayee bandobast bade krishakon tathaa raajaaon or jameendaaron se kiye
 Although impressed by the political rationale, he leased one pargana to the monopolist who collected every tax for five years

 Lord Cornwallis was also in favor of Zamindari system
 usne san 1791 i0 bengal, bihar tathaa urisa main das varshiya bandobast kii ajna di
 Two years later, the Board of Directors gave permission to make this ten-year plan a permanent settlement
 madras main jameendaari pratha kaa udai angrej shaskaon kii nilaam niti dwaara hua
 The lands of the villages were divided and auctioned and sold to the highest payer
 prarambh main avadh main bandobast krishak se hi kiya gaya tha parantu tadnantar raajnneetik kaarnon se yah bandobast jameendaaron se kiya gaya
 In the settlement report of the great historian Sir Vincent A
 Smith, Aligarh, it clearly acknowledges that the settlements were made to the monopolies, aiming only at utility, ignoring the prevailing land rights
 anyaaypurna karrashi ikattha karne kaa yah sabase saral upaay he tathaa yah raajnneeti ke drushtikon se bhi upyogi he kyonki iske falswaroop sarkaar kaa ek shaktishaalee tathaa dhani varg kii sahaayta milti rahegi
 Thus in the history of India for the first time these settlements established the class of landlords between the state and the farmers by the policy of the British, which resulted in the loss of the property rights of the farmers who had been in existence since time immemorial
 yah madhyavarti varg din prati din dhani hota gaya kyonki angrej shaasha apni karrashi main se adhik se adhik hissaa unhen pralobhan ke rup main dete rahe
 In these settlements, no attention was paid to the interests of the farmers, as a result of which their grief, humiliation and humiliation increased day by day
 kai baar angrej shaskaon ne bhi is ore dhyaan dilaayaa ki krishakon kii bhudhruti kii raksha kii jaay evam unka lagaan bandobast ke samay tak nirdhaarit kar diya jaay
 Still nothing was done
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej shaskaon kii dharna thi ki jameendaaron ke saath vyavhaar main udaartaa dikhaane par jab ve sampann evam santusht rahenge to ve apane asamiyon ko nahin sataayenge jiske falswaroop ve bhi khushhaal rahenge
 But this was his great mistake because the landlords always betrayed their duty
 at: angrej shaasha yah mahasoos karne lage ki is bhul kaa sudhaar kiya jaae
 As a result, they arranged land related legislation to improve the condition of the farmers
 yah kadam jameendaari pratha ke ast kii disha main pratham charan kaha ja saktaa he
 In this first phase, which lasted from 1859 AD to 1929 AD, the laws that were enacted imposed certain restrictions on the rights of landlords to increase the rent and also benefited the higher class farmers
 kintu in kanoonon kaa mukhya uddeshy jameendaaron ko lagaan vasuul karne main sahuuliyat dene kaa tha jisase ve rajya ko rajasav thik samay par de saken
 In 1859 AD, the first land related act was passed
 yah adhinium samast british bharat ke liye ek adarsh bhoomi-adhinium tha jiske anuroop adhinium bharat ke sabhi bhaagon main paas hue or samay samay par unamem sanshodhan bhi kiye gaye taaki asantusht krishakon ko shant kiya ja sake
 But the landlords still continued to squeeze the peasants to recover their just and unjust taxes, which caused widespread dissatisfaction and restlessness among the farmers
 jameendaari pratha ke ast ke kram main doosraa charan san 1930 i0 se 1944 i0 tak rahaa
 During this time, peasant movements started happening all over the country

 The peasant class became more vocal and demanded the stability of land holdings and reduction in revenue

 The Malabar Tenancy Act is a landmark in this regard
 iske baad bhopal land revenue act, 1935 tathaa assam tenency act 1935 paas hue
 Under the Government of India Act, 1935, when the 'special Autonomy' was inaugurated, the Provincial Governments arranged Land Reforms Acts which gave more rights to the farmers and curtailed the rights of the landlords

 Even after the enactment of these Land Reforms Acts, the evils of the Zamindari system existed, although the Zamindars were paralyzed to a large extent

 The Congress decided to participate in the elections and in December 1945 took out the election manifesto
 is ghoshnaptr main jameendaari unmoolan ke vishay main spashtatya kaha gaya ki ‘bhoomi vyavastha kaa sudhaar, jisaki bharat main ati aavashyaktaa he, krishakon tathaa rajyake bich madhyavarti varg ko hataane se sambandhit he
 Therefore the rights of this intermediate class should be obtained by giving proper compensation '

 Zamindari system hindered Indian economic development because the big landlords were always advocates of reactionism
 ‘landan iconomist’ ne inke vishay main likhaa tha ki ‘inamen se adhiktar ‘thekarase’ ke paatr ‘lard steen’ kii tarah dushcharitra, ‘jine astine’ ke ‘mistar benet’ kii tarah aalsee, ‘surtijasquaire’ kii tarah sharaabi the 
 The Bengal Land Commission also came to the conclusion that 'permanent settlement of 1793 AD, for whatever reasons was deemed appropriate at that time, is unsuitable in today's situation and has created so many evils in the zamindari system that it is no longer in the interest of the nation Even the type is no longer useful
 ’ bhartiya tathaa paashchaatya arthvettaon kii raay main jameendaari unmoolan adhik krishi utpaadan ke liye atyaavashyak he
 In addition, this practice has ended in every part of the world due to lack of time
 punasch, yah pratha rajya ke liye adhik kharchili he
 Above all, this practice had reached such a state at this time that if it had not been eradicated, it would have caused disasters not only on national economic problem but also on social security
 at: san 1946 i0 main chunaav main safalataa ke falswaroop jab har praant main congress mantrimandal bane to chunaav pratigya ke anusaar jameendaari pratha ko samaapt karne ke liye vidheyak prastut kiye gaye
 These Bills became Act from 1950 to 1955, which resulted in the abolition of Zamindari system in India and re-established direct relations between farmers and the state
 bhoomi ke swatvadhikaar ab krishakon ko waapas mil gaye jinka upyog ve anadi paramparaagat kaal se karte chale aae the
 In this way, the zamindari system that emerged with the arrival of the British in our country also ended at the end of their rule

 Chyavan Rishi became blind due to thorns in his eyes
 apane andhe ho jane par unhen bada krodh aayaa or unhone tatkaal sharyaati kii sena kaa mel-mutr ruk jane kaa shaap de diya
 King Shariati got very upset with this incident and asked if anyone had given any kind of trouble to the Chyavan Rishi
 Sukanya told all the things to her father on asking him like this
 raja sharyaati ne tatkaal chyavan rishi ke paas pahunch kar kshamayachna kii
 Chyavan Rishi said that Rajan! Your daughter has committed a terrible crime
 yadi tum mere shaap se mukt hona chaahate ho to tumhen apni kanya kaa vivaah mere saath karnaa hoga
 Thus Sukanya was married to the Chyavan Rishi

 became exactly like that of the Ashwani Kumaras
 unhone sukanya se kaha ki devi! tum hamamen se apane pati ko pahchaan kar use apane ashram le jaao
 On this Sukanya recognized her husband with his sharp intellect and pathetic religion and held her hand
 sukanya kii tej buddhi or pativrat dharm se ashwanikumar atyant prasann huye or un donon ko aashirwad dekar vahaan se chale gayi
 When King Sharyati got the news of Chyavan Rishi's eyes recovering to get new youth, he was very happy and he talked to Chyavan Rishi to meet him and perform Yajna
 chyavan rishi ne unhen yajna kii diksha di
 When Ashwanyakumaras were given a part in that Yajna, then Devraj Indra objected that Ashwanekumar is the physician of the gods, hence he is not eligible to participate in the Yajna
 kintu chyavan rishi indra kii baton ko ansuna kar ashwanikumaron ko somras dene lage
 Enraged by this, Indra struck Vajra at him, but the sage stopped the Vajra with his Tapobal and created a terrible monster
 vah rakshas indra ko nigalane ke liye daud padaa
 Fearing Indra, Ashwanekumar accepted the part of the yagna and Chyavan Rishi consumed the demon and freed Indra from his suffering

 puraani metric pranali main kai ikaayiyon ke samooh prayog kiye jate the
 SI was developed in 1960 from the old meter-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimeter-gram-second system, which had many difficulties
 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units
 parantu iske apwaad sanyukt rajya america or britain hai, jahaan abhi bhi gaiyr-si ikaayiyon unki puraani pranaliyaan lagu hai
 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957
 iske saath hi yahaan nayaa paisa bhi lagu hua, jo ki swayan dashamalav pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Many new naming units came into force in this system
 is pranali main saat mul ikaiyaan or anya kai vyutpann ikaiyaan hai
 Other units are also used with the SI system in some scientific and cultural fields
 SI upsargon ke madhyam se bahut choti or bahut badi matraaon ko vyakt karne main saralata hoti he
 The difference between the definition and implementation of an entity is important
 prayek SI mul ikai kii paribhaasha saavdhaanee purvak banaai gai he taaki vah apurv or adwitiya ho or saath saath ek thos saidhantik aadhaar prastut kare jis par aadhaarit sabase parishuddh or punarutpaadaneey maapan kiye ja saken
 The process of implementing a definition of a unit is one in which that definition, like that unit, establishes the value of its quantity and the uncertainty associated with it; Can be used
 kuch mahatvapurn ikaayiyon kii paribhaashaayen kaise karyanvit kii jaati hai, yah BIPM kii websit par diya gaya haiek SI vyutpann ikai adwitiya rup keval SI mul ikaayiyon ke rup main hi paribhaashit hoti he
 For example, the SI derivative unit of electrical resistance, ohms, is uniquely defined by this relation: ω = m2 kg s − 3 a − 2, which is the result of the definition of the amount of electrical resistance
 vaise koi bhi tarika, jo ki bhautikee ke siddhanton / niyamon se saamanjasy rakhata ho, vah kisi bhi SI ikaayiyon ke karyanvayan hetu prayog ho saktaa he
 The metric system was designed by a group of scientists

 To make this group a rational measurement system; Was unified and authorized by the French Emperor Louis XVI
 francisi kranti ke uparaant nai sarkaar dwaara yah pranali angeekrut kar lee gai thi
 a new decimal meter was also adopted by the National Conference on August 1, 1793, and defined a temporary length as well as other decimal units
 7 april, 1795 ko, gramme evam kilogramme ne puraani shabdaawalee "gravet" evam "grev" kaa sthaan liya
 On December 10, 1799, the metric system was permanently adopted in France
 aaj vishwa bhar main prayog ho rahi metric pranali ne kai badlaav dekhe hai
 It has also superseded many traditional systems
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke bahut baad tak kai bhinn maapan pranaliyaan vishwa bhar main prayukt ho raheen thim
 Many of these systems were different from the metric system, while others were based on either the Imperium system or the American system
 tab yah aavashyaktaa siddh hui ki in sab kaa metrikaran hona chaiye, jisase ek vishwavyaapee maapan pranali banaai ja sake
 Consequently, the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures was held in 1948 in which the International Committee on Weights and Measures was directed to conduct an international study of the measurement requirements of scientific, technological and teaching committees
 is adhyayan ke parinaamon par aadhaarit, dasvin CGPM ne 1954 main yah nirnay kiya ki chah mul ikaayiyon se ek anterrashtriya pranali vyutapann kii jaae, jo ki yantric evam vidyutchumbakeey matraaon kii saath hi taapmaana evam drushti sambandhi vikiranon kaa maapan uplabdh kara paae
 The six original units approved were meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes, degrees, calvin and candela

 Several countries have formed accreditation bodies to authorize certification bodies, which audit organizations applying for certification of compliance with ISO 9001
 haalanki aam taur par ISO 9000:2000 pramann ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jane vaala vaastavik maanak, jiske aadhaar par kisi sanghathan ke gunvattta prabandhan ko pramanit kiya ja saktaa he, ISO 9001:2008 he

 It is considered beneficial for internal auditors when they conduct audits outside their general management line to bring a degree of freedom to their decision
 1994 ke maanak ke tahat, lekha-pareekshan kii prakriya ko paryaapt rup se "anupaalan lekha-pareekshan" kaa pradarshan karke sambodhit kiya ja saktaa tha: The 2000 standard uses a different approach
 lekha-pareekshakon se jokhim, sthiti or mahatv par prakaash daalkar "anupaalan" ko kanthsth karne kii keval lekha-pareekshan ke paar jane kii ummid kii jaati he
 This means that they are expected to pay more attention to what is formally determined, rather than just following what is effective
 Its difference from the previous standard can be explained as follows: lekha-pareekshan ke liye ISO 19011 kaa maanak anya prabandhan pranaaliyon, jaise - EMS, FSMS ityadi, ke atirikt ISO 9001 main bhi lagu hota he
 The ISO 9001 standard is generalized and abstract

 " ISO 9001 kisi bhi tarah se is baat kaa sanket nahin he ki isaki pramanit pranaaliyon ke istemaal se utpaadit utpaada kisi bhi tarah se achche hai

 Wade argues that ISO 9000 is effective as a guideline, but by promoting it as a standard "it helps to mislead companies into thinking that certification means better quality, 


 which makes the organization Require setting their own quality standards
 " savistaar ke taur par, vade kaa tark he ki ISO 9001 ke vinirdeshnon par bharosa karne se ek safal gunvattta pranali kii guarantee nahin milti he

 In fact this cost may cause a company to face a competitive disadvantage when competing against a non ISO 9000 certified company

 "if you just want to see the certificate on the wall, then maybe, you will build a paper system that doesn't require you to do much the way you want to run your business," Roger of ISO Frost said
 Certification by an independent auditor is often seen as a problem area and according to Barnes "has become a means of increasing consulting services
 " vastav main, ISO khud salaah detaa he ki ISO 9001 ko pramann ke bina, keval gunvattta ke laabh ke liye jise hasil kiya ja saktaa he, lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Another reported problem is the competition between several certification bodies, which leads to an intuitive view of the defects observed in operating a firm's quality system

 cryptobranchoideasalamandroideasirenoidea Salamander is a common name for about 500 species of amphibians
 inhen aam taur par inke patale sharir, choti naak or lambii punch, in chhipakali-jaisi visheshtaon se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 All known fossil and extinct species fall under the genus Codata, while the extant species are sometimes classified together as Eurodella
 zyaadaatar sallamanderon ke agle pairon main chaar or pichley pairon main paanch ungliyaan hoti hai
 Their moist skin usually makes them habitable in habitats in a wet location, often in or near water or under some protection
 sallamanderon kii kuch prajatiyaan apane puure jivan kaal main puri tarah se jaleey hoti hai, kuch bich-bich main pani main rahati hai or kuch bilkul sthaliy hoti hai jaise ki vayask
 haalanki merudanddhariyon main yah ek anuthi baat he lekin ye apane khoye hue angon or sharir ke anya hisson ko punah utpann karne main sakasham hote hai
 Typically full-grown salamanders have a thin body, elongated tail, and simple four legs like lizards with four ingredients

 Most species have four toes and five toes at the back and no claws
 sallamander aksar chamkile rang ke hote hai jo yaa to donon lingon main saalon bhar maujuud rahata he yaa sirf naron main, khaas taur par prajnan kaal ke dauraan hota he
 However, the species living in completely underground habitats is often white or pink in color and no spots are found on the skin
 kai sallamander apekshaakrit chote hote hai, lekin kuch nishchit apwaad bhi hote hai
 Their size ranges from extremely small salamanders with a total length of 2
7 centimeters, including tail, to large Chinese salamanders, which can be 1
8 meters in length and weigh up to 65 kg
 haalanki zyaadaatar 10 centimetre or 20 centimetre ke bich kii lambaai ke hote hai

 Species that do not have lungs breathe through gills
 adhikansh maamalon main ye bahari galaade hote hai jo inke sir ke donon taraf kalgiyon kii tarah dikhaai padate hai, haalanki emphiumas main aatanrik galaade or galfdon ke chhed hote hai
 Some terrestrial salamanders have lungs that are used for breathing, although they are simple and thalamic in contrast to the more complex organs found in mammals
 kai prajatiyon jaise ki olm main vayaskon kii tarah fefde or galaade donon hote hai
 In some terrestrial species both lungs and gills are not found and they exchange air through their skin, a process called valerian respiration in which the network of tubules extends throughout the skin and inside the mouth
 
 yahan tak ki fefdon vaali kuch prajatiyaan is tareeke se twachaa ke jariye saans le sakati hai
 Mucus is secreted from the salamander's skin which helps keep the organism moist in dry places and maintains its salt balance when in the water, as well as lubricating it during swimming
 sallamander apni twachaa main maujuud grathiyon se vish kaa srav bhi karte hai or kuch main inke atirikt anunay sambandhi pheromons ke srav ke liye twachaa granthiyaan bhi hoti hai
 Hunting is still another unique aspect of salamander

 The tip of the tongue is made of a mucus which makes its end sticky thereby capturing prey
 pedu kshetra kii mansapeshiyon kaa istemaal jeebh ko ghumaane ke kram main or hyod ke pichley hisse ko isaki mul sthiti main waapas laane main kiya jaataa he
 However, many of the highly aquatic species do not have muscles in the tongue and are not used to catch prey, while most other species have a mobile tongue but without adaptation to the hyoid bone
 Most species of salamander have small teeth in both the upper and lower jaws
 mendhakon ke vipareet yahan tak ki sallamander ke larva main bhi is tarah ke daant paae jate hai
 Salamanders use trichomatic color vision in the ultraviolet range based on two types of photoreceptors, more sensitive to 400 nm, 500 nm and 570 nm, to find their prey
 sthaayee rup se bhumigat sallamanderon ke paas choti ankhen hoti hai jo yahan tak ki twachaa kii ek parat se dhaki ho sakati hai
 In larvae and adults of some highly aquatic species, there is a lateral linear organ like fishes that can detect changes in water pressure
 sallamanderon ke paas bahari kaan nahin hote hai or keval ek alpaviksit madhya kaan hota he
 Salamanders use their free tail to ward off predators
 ve apni punch ko gira lete hai or yah thodi der ke liye chatpataati rahati he or sallamander yaa to bhaag jate hai yaa phir us samay tak sthir rahete hai jab tak ki shikari kaa dhyaan nahin bant jaataa

 This movement was the youth of the Turks, so it is called the 'young Turks' movement
 ‘yuva turk’ aandolan abdul hamid ke nirankush shashan ke viruddh ek pratikriya ke rup main prakat hua

 But, Abdul Hameed still remained determined
 krantikariyon ne isse puraa laabh uthaaya or 23 july ko kranti prarambh ho gai
 In Salonika the revolutionaries organized a government and a constitution was announced for Turkey
 sultan ko ab pataa chalaa ki uske rajya main asaadhaaran ghatana ghat chuki he
 However, it was delayed by then
