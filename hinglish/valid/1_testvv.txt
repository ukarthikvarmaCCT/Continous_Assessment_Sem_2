 It is called Messier 31, M31 or NGC 224 and is often referred to in texts as the great Andromeda Niharika
 andromeda sarpilaakaar tara punj, hamaari sabase nikatatam akashganga he lekin kul milakar yah sabase nikatatam taramandal nahin he
 It can be seen as a stain on the moonless night, it can be seen by objects far away from the naked eye, and can also be seen in urban areas with binoculars
 iske naam ko us akaash kshetra se liya gaya he jahaan yah prakat hota he, andromeda nakshatramandal or jiskaa naam puranic rajkumaari andromeda ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Andromeda is the largest galaxy in the local group consisting of Andromeda galaxy, Milky Way galaxy, Triangulum galaxy and 30 other minor galaxies

 Viewed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope, it has been found that M31 contains billions of stars, many more than our planetary planets whose number is about c
 200-400 billion
 
 While in 2006, the galaxy's planets were estimated at ~ 80% compared to Andromeda, which is roughly equivalent to 7
1 × 1011 solar planets, a 2009 study showed that the density of Andromeda and the Akash Ganga is roughly the same

 Charles Messier listed it as the M31 planet in 1764 and was erroneously credited as an explorer to Marius, who was unaware of Sufi al's earlier work
 1785 main, khagolvid wiliam harshal ne M31 ke pramukh kshetra main dhundhlee laal rang varna kaa ullekh kiya
 He believed that it was closest to the "great Nebula" and based on the color and size of the nebula, he miscalculated that it was no more than 2000 times larger than Sirius' distance
 1864 main wiliam hagins ne M31 ke varnakram kaa avlokan kiya or yah paaya ki yah gasiy nebula se bhinn he
 The spectra of M31 form deep absorption lines exhibiting a continuum of frequencies as layers that help identify the chemical mixture of a substance
 andromeda nebula bahut adhik alag taron ke spectra ke samaan tha jisase isaki utpatti hui jisamen M31 kii taarakeey prakruti thi
 In 1885, the supernova was first seen in the M31, which was seen only once in this galaxy
 us samay M31 ko sabase nazadiiki grah mana gaya tha, isliye vastu paas tha ek vichaar karne ke liye he, isliye is kalpana ko bahut adhik lokapriyata nahin mil saki or is asambaddha ghatana ko nova kaha gaya or iskaa naam "nova 1885" ke anusaar rakhaa gaya
 The first photograph of the M31 was taken by Isaac Robert in 1857 at his private observatory, Sussex, England
 lambii avadhi ke khulaase ke baad tarapunj kii sarpilaakaar sanrachana ko pehali baar dekha gaya
 However, at that time it was generally considered to be a nebula in our galaxy and Robert mistakenly thought that the M31 and similar spiral nebula were in fact the form of the structure of the solar system that was taken with the help of satellite Nessant planets
 hamaari saura pranali ke sambandh main is grah ke trigyakaar veg ko 1912 main vesto slifer dwaara lowell vedhashala main, spectroscopy kaa upyog karke mapa gaya tha
 As a result, at that time, its velocity was recorded very fast in the direction of the sun at 300 kilometres per second

 So he became the proponent of the so-called "island universe", the spiral nebula that was actually an independent galaxy
 1920 main, harley shorpale or curtis ke bich akaash ganga, sarpilaakaar nebula or brahmad ke aayam se sambandhit mahaan bahes aarambh ho gai
 In support of the claim that the great Andromeda Nebula was externally tarapunz, Curtis observed the texture of dark lines resembling foggy clouds in our tarapunj and observed a characteristic doppler shift
 1922 main, arnest opic ne M31 kii duuri ke akalan kaa ek bahut hi sundar or saral khagoleey vidhi prastut kii
 He placed our Tarapanja at about 450 KPC from Andromeda, which is about 1500 KLY

 Andromeda played an important role in the study of galaxies, as it is the closest spiral galaxy
 1943 main, walter bade andromeda akashganga ke kendriya kshetra main taron kaa samaadhaan nikaalane vaala pehla vyakti tha
 Based on observations of this galaxy, based on his observations about it, he was able to identify two stars based on their metallicity, namely the high-velocity stars in the Young Disc Type i and the Type II reds emerging in the Old Age

 Dr
 Bade also discovered that there are two types of galaxies which are twice the size of M31 and other stars of the universe

 Following this, it is found that the small galaxy passed along Andromeda's disk along the polar axis of the latter
 Its collision caused more than half of the smaller M32's bodies to break apart and create a ring ring in Andromeda
 M31 ke bade hue prabhamandal ke adhyayan se pataa laga ki isaki tulana akashganga ke saath karnaa sambhav nahin kyonki taron ke prabhamandal main aamtaur par "aparyaapt dhaatu" hoti hai jo duuri badhane ke saath-saath badhati chali jaati hai
 These evidences show that both galaxies follow the same evolutionary path

 The luminous valence is designed in P1, equivalent to the galaxy center
 P2 kii dhundhlee sanyojaktaa akashganga ke centre main sthit he or 3-5x107m☉ blike hole sthit he
 Scott Tramanne suggested that the interpretation of the observed double nucleus is possible if the P1 central black hole had a projection of the image of the star in the focal chamber around the stars
 uski utkendratha is prakaar kii he ki taare kakshiya apocenter se jude rahete hai jinke kaaran taron kii abhimukhataa main vruddhi hoti he

 Whereas, at the time of its initial discovery, it was hypothesized that the luminosity of the double nucleus was the remaining part of the small galaxy "cannibalized" near Andromenda, after which there was no clear explanation
 iskaa mul kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke cendrak kaa kendriya blike hole dwaara utaar-chadhaav vaale vyavdhaan ke kaaran jeevankaal atyadhik chota ho jaataa he
 While partially resolving it is possible if P1 has its own stabilizing black hole, the upheaval in P1 does not mean that it has a black hole at its center

 globular 1 main kai taarakeey sankhya bahut adhik he or saamaanya golakaar ke liye inaki sanrachana bahut adhik saghan hoti he
 As a result, some consider G1 to be a small part of a small galaxy that was considered M31 some time ago

 What makes them different from circular groups is that they are larger - several hundred light years larger - and many times less dense than them
 isliye, taron ke bich duuri haal hi main khoje gaye vistaarit punjon main kaaphi adhik he
 Similar to the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy consists of satellite galaxies numbered 14 smaller galaxies
 sabase acchhee jaankaree vaali or sabase adik dekhi jane vaali upgrah akashganga M32 or M110 hai
 Based on current evidence, it appears that the M32 has a very close encounter with the M31
 M32 kabhi bahut badi akashganga rahi hogi jiske baad M31 ne iske taarakeey bimb ko hataa diya or iske antarbhag main taare ke nirmaan main badi teji ke saath vruddhi hui jisaki samaapti uske baad ho gai
 The M110 may also have come into contact with M31, and astronomers discovered metal-rich stars in the M31's halo that appear as lines from these satellite galaxies
 M110 ke dhul nahin he jo haal kii or vartmaan taare kii banaavat kii taraf ingit karata he
 In 2006, it was discovered that nine of these galaxies are parallel, dividing the core of the Andromeda galaxy rather than arranging their independent interactions randomly
 This may indicate a normal tidal origin for satellites

 Earlier, the shares were traded and traded by oral bids and the buy and sell deal was done by word of mouth
 lekin ab yah sara len-dein stock exange ke network se jude computaron ke jariye hota he
 This facility is also available on the Internet
 aaj sthiti yah he ki kharidne-bechney vaale ek-duusare ko jaan bhi nahin pate
 In a way, there is an auction of shares here
 agar kisi ko benchnaa hota he to sabase oonchi boli lagane vaale ko ye share bench diya jaataa he
 Or if someone wants to buy shares, then the stock is bought from the seller who is ready at the lowest price
 share mandi (jaise bombai stock exange yaa naishanal stock exange is tarah ki boliyaan lagane ke liye zaruri sabhi tarah ki suvidhaaye muhaiyaa karaate he
 Think, millions of shares are exchanged in a day
 kitna mushkil ho jaye agar sabhi karobariyon ko chilla chilla ke hi kharide or benchne waalo ko dhundhna ho
 If this happens, buying and selling shares will become impossible
 share mandiyaan is kaam ko saral or sahi dhang se karne kaa moolbhoot dhaancha pradaan karti he
 This basic structure is given through many types of rules, computer help, share broker, internet medium
 asal me share bazaar ek bahut hi suvidhajanak sabzi mandi se zyaada kuch bhi nahi he

 samasthaapan yaa homeostasis kisi tantra kaa vah gun he jiske dwaara vah apane aantarik paryaavaran main aavashyak parivartan karke taap, piech aadi ko niyat rakhata he
 Tantra - can be of two types - open or closed

 duusari ore, conformers paryaavaran parameter nirdhaarit karne ke liye anumati dete hai
 For example, endotherms exhibit a constant body to maintain animal temperature, while exotherms display a different body temperature
 indothermik jaanwaron ke udhaaharan main standhari or pakshi shaamil he, akzothirmik jaanwaron ke udaahranon main sarisrup or kuch samudri jeev shaamil he
 Human nature is of "regulators" because they are the ultimate example of control over its parameters in a variety of climates and conditions
 vyavhaar anukulan ke dwaara indothermik jaanavar kisi permetre par niyantran kar sakate he
 For example, snakes raise their body temperature by resting on a hot rock in the morning
 niamakon bhi bahari paristhitiyon ke liye uttaradaayi he, tathaapi, yadi ek hi dhoop main sukha hua boulder hota to gilahari ke chayapach ke liye aantarik garmi ke utpaadan kii jarurat kam ho jaati he An advantage of homeostatic regulation is that it allows an organism to function in a wide range of effective environmental conditions
 udhaaharan ke liye, actoseerms kam taapmaana par sust ho jate hai, jabaki ek sah sthit indotherm puri tarah se sakriy kiya ja saktaa hai
 This thermal stability comes at a value since the energy requirement in addition to the regulation of an automated system
 ek kaaran saanp ke keval ek baar ek saptaah main bhojan khaane kaa he ki ve homeostasis banane ke liye urja kaa upyog bahut kam karte he Homeostatic regulation extends beyond the control of temperature
 sabhi jaanwaron ko bhi viniyamit rakt glucose, saath hi unke khun kii ekaagratha banaayin rakhni hoti he
 Mammals regulate glucose with insulin and glucagon
 maanav sharir main sharkara kaa str lagaataar bana rahata he, yahan tak ki ek 24 ghante ke upwas ke baad bhi 
 upwas kii lambii avadhi ke dauraan bhi, glucose kaa str thodaa bahut hi kam hota hai
 Insulin, made by the beta cells of the pancreas, carries glucose to the body's cells and the liver retains the glucose it receives, thus lowering blood sugar levels
 insulin hyperglyasamiya ko rokane ke liye madad karata he
 When cells are deficient in insulin or become resistant to it, diabetes occurs
 glucagan, agnyashay alpha koshikaon ke dwaara banaaya jaataa he, jamaa glikojan istemaal karne yaa carbohydrate carbon sutron ke madhyam se glucose ke upyog main madad karata he is prakaar sharir main glucose banataa he or hypoglsamia ko roktaa he gurdein khun main se atirikt pani or yanon ko dur karte he
 They are expelled as urine
 gurde stanadhariyon ke homeostatik niyaman main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa pradarshan, namak, atirikt pani or rakt main se uria hataate hai ye sharir ke mukhya barbaad utpaada hai
 Another homeostatic regulation occurs in the stomach
 aant homeostasis kii puri tarah se samaj nahin he lekin yah mana jaataa he ki toll kii tarah receptor abhivyakti profile ise karne ke liye yogadan karte hai
 The intestinal epithelial cells have important factors that contribute to homeostasis 1
 They have different cellulocular distribution, compared to normal gut mucosa
 ek udhaaharan he jise flagellin sakriy karke, Sleep time trend depends on a balance between homeostatic sleep, sleep since the last episode is sufficient since bhe need a function of the amount of time to sleep and the circadian rhythm that is structured and restorative sleep Determine the ideal time correctly
 sabhi homeostatik niyantran pranali viniyamit ke liye ghatakon anyonyashrith char rahaa he kam se kam teen receptor maahaul he samvedan ghatak he ki monitor main badlaav ke liye or jawaab
 jab hosh ek receptor prerana, yah centre niyantran ek bhejtaa he jaankaree ke liye, ko banaae rakhaa ghatak he ki set par seemaa he jo ek char rahaa he
 The control center determines an appropriate response to motivation
 sabase samasthiti tantra main niyantran centre dimag he
 The control center is then an afferent, which sends signals to muscles, organs, or other structures that can receive signals from the control center
 sanket praapt karne ke baad, ek badlaav hota nakaaratmak pratikriya ke saath yah niraashajanak karne ke liye yaa sahi pratikriya vichlan dwaara sakaaratmak yaa to ise badhaane ke saath Positive feedback mechanisms that have been designed to have been activated have already created a production by accelerating stimulation or enhancing
 nakaaratmak pratikriya tantra he ki banaae rakhane ke liye yaa ek set or sankeern seemaa ke bheetar shaareerik kaaryon ko viniyamit karne ke aarambh ke vipareet, sakaaratmak pratikriya tantra ko saamaanya parvatamala ke baahar kaa str badhaane ke liye dizin kiye hai
 For this purpose, the obtaining of a series of events creates a cascading process that increases the effect of the stimulus
 is prakriya ke liye phydemand ho saktaa he lekin shaayad hi kabhi hota ja rahaa he twaran aniyantraneey ke jokhim kii vajah se sharir ke dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he sakate hai
 One positive example in the body phenomenon is blood platelet accumulation, which, in turn, causes blood clots to break in the blood lining or in response to a blood vessel
 Another example is the delivery release of contractions that take place fast during oxytocin
 nakaaratmak pratikriya tantra nirgam yaa kisi bhi ang yaa uske kaamkaaj kii saamaanya shrenee main waapas pranali kii gatividhi ko kam karne se milakar
 raktchaap ko viniyamit he is bare main ek acha udhaaharan
 rakt vahiniyon kii deevaaron ke khilaaf khun ke pravaah ke pratirodh kar sakate hai bhaavana jab raktchaap bad jaataa he
 Blood vessels act as receptors and they relay this message to the brain
 The heart sends a message to the brain and blood vessels, both of which are effectors
 dil dar) vasodiltion yaa ke rup main rakt vahikaaon ko kam hoga vruddhi main vyas
 is badlaav ke khun ko apni saamaanya shrenee ke liye waapas gir dabaav kaa kaaran hoga
 vipareet hoga jab raktchaap kam ho jaati he or vasoconstriktion kaa kaaran hoga
 Another important example is seen when the body is deprived of food
 sharir to ek saamaanya mulya se kam chayapachay set bindu riset jayega
 yah sharir ke liye kaary jari rakhane ke liye anumati hogi ek dhimi dar par, yadhyapi sharir bhukh se mar rahaa he
 Therefore, people who deprive themselves of food while trying to lose weight will find it easier to shed weight initially and more difficult to lose later
 This in itself allows the body to survive with a low supply of energy in the body due to a low metabolic set point
 vyaayaam chayapachay maang badhaane ke dwaara is aashay badal sakate hai
 Another good example of a negative feedback mechanism is temperature control
 hypothalamus, nazar rakhata he, jo sharir ke taapmaana 
 is tarah ke badlaav ke uttar ke liye grathiyon kii uttejnaa paidaa karne ke liye pasinaa he ki taapmaana ko kam yaa vibhinn mansapeshiyon ke sanket karne ke liye sharir kaa taapmaana badhaane ke kanpakanpi ho saktaa he
 Both feedbucks are equally important for the healthy functioning of one's body
 jatiltaayen paidaa kar sakate hai do feedback main se koi bhi prabhavit kar rahe hai yaa kisi bhi tarah se badal diya
 Most disease results from homeostasis disturbance, a condition known as homeostatic imbalance
 yah umr ke rup main, har jeev apane niyantran pranaaliyon main dakshata kho denge

 iske alaava, samasthiti asantulan bhi bhautik umr badhane ke saath jude badlaav ke liye jimmedaar he
 Even more sickness and aging is serious compared to other characteristics of death
 dil kii vifaltaa dekha gaya he jahaan nammaatr kaa nakaaratmak pratikriya tantra abhibhoot ho jate hai or vinaashkari sakaaratmak pratikriya tantra tab upar le lo
 a homeostatic diseases result from an imbalance in the blood that includes diabetes, dehydration, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, arthritis, and any disease currently caused by the toxin
 All of these conditions result from the presence of an increased amount of a particular substance
 Under ideal conditions, homeostatic control mechanisms should prevent this imbalance from occurring, but, in some people, the mechanisms do not work efficiently enough or the level of the substance over which it can be controlled exceeds

 Budget Theory for Metabolic Energy Organization Dynamic Structure Delineates and more) An organism in reserves or, sometimes referred to as a 'biodiversity' ability to refer to, primarily the size of the local climate
 This view has been largely abandoned by modern ecologists in favor of nonneculeibrium ideas of how ecosystems function, most at a rate that makes naturalistic ecosystems at a rate that makes a "climax" community inaccessible

 The case of Krakato reached its climax community, with eight hundred different species recorded in the island in 1983, a hundred years after the eruption that cleared life away from the island
 The evidence confirms that this number has been homeostatic for some time, with the introduction of new species rapidly leading to the eradication of old ones
 Evidences of Krakata and other disturbed island ecosystems have been confirmed by many of the eigenographic island theories, mimicking general principles of species ecological succession, albeit in an almost exclusively comprised of endemic systems
 pariklpana main gaeyaa, james ghunghar kaha ki apane swayan ke astitv ke liye bade paimaane par puure jivan baat kaary ke rup main paryaavaran ek vishaal samasthiti utpaadan superorgonism ki paryaavaran grahon kii sakriyata se apni modifies 
 is drishy main, puure grah samasthiti rakhata he
 Whether this type of system exists on Earth is still open for debate
 However, some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted
 udhaaharan ke liye, vayumandaleey carbon dioxide kaa str vruddhi, kuch paudhon ke liye behatar ho janaa or is prakaar ke vaataavaran se carbon dioxide ko hataane or adhik kaary karne main sakasham hai
 When the sunlight is plentiful and atmospheric temperatures rise, the sea surface of the waterborne phytoplankton and DMS produce more dimethyl sulfide
 DMS molecules act as cloud condensation clouds, which produce more nuclei, and thus increase atmospheric atmospheres and feed it back to lower atmospheric temperatures
 As scientists learn more about Gaia, vast numbers of positive and negative feedback loops are being discovered that, together, maintain a metastable condition sometimes within a very wide range of environmental conditions
 Environmental pressures, such as competition or changes in temperature, can lead to adaptation of species / extinction over time
 prayog ke udhaaharan: "reective samasthiti predation jaise ek tatkaal samasthiti ek chunauti ke jawaab he
 " haalanki, kisi bhi samasthiti pratikriya ke bina asambhav he - kyonki samasthiti he or ghatana "kiya janaa chahie ek" pratikriya
 The phrase "reactive homeostasis" is to say that "reactive compensation for homeostatic single point restablishing bus" is less than homeostatic restablishing
 " samasthiti - se bhinn ek ghatana he yaa alag tarah kaa samasthiti yah chahie bhramit ke saath ek nahin ho, yah samasthiti bas muaavja 
 The term has come to be used in other areas, as well

 Back to the innovation of maneuvers involving anti-lock brakes, some minor skids, avoking fear and avoidance: Now anti-lock systems do not limit range for such responses and behavior patterns no longer expand into the punitive zone
 It has also been suggested that the ecological crisis results are dramatic or alarming, in the instance of a proven homeostatic risk that continues until a particular behavior actually occurs
 samajashastriyon or manovaigyanikon samasthiti tanaav ho saktaa he kaa ullekh he, ek jansankhya kii pravriti yaa ek vyakti ke tanaav ke str par ek nishchit rahane ke liye, aksar paidaa kritrim tanaavon agar "str ke tanaav" prakritik paryaapt nahin he
 Ján-rnoi Lyotard, a postmodern theorist, is one of the homeostasis to apply the power of the term to the principle of 'centers' describing it as being governed by a ', for example,' scientific hierarchy, Which for years will be a radical new discovery sometimes neglected because it accepts previously accepted criteria

06 Madan Garhi Gabbhana is a village in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 jameendaari pratha bharat main mughal kaal evam british kaal main prachlit ek rajnatik-saamaajik kuriti thi jisamen bhoomi kaa swaamitv us par kaam karne waalon kaa na hokar kisi or kaa hota tha jo kheti karne waalon se kar vasuulate the
 This practice was abolished after India became independent
 bharat kii pracheen vichaardhaara ke anusaar bhoomi saarvajanik sampatti thi, isaliye yah vyakti kii sampatti nahin ho sakati thi
 Land, like air, water and light, was considered a gift of nature
 maharishi jaimini ke matanusaar "raja bhoomi kaa samarpan nahin kar saktaa tha kyonki yah uski sampatti nahin varan maanav samaaj kii sammilit sampatti he
 That is why everyone has equal rights over it "
 manu kaa bhi spasht kathan he ki "rishiyon ke matanusaar bhumiswamitv kaa pratham adhikaar use he jisane jangal katkar use saaf kiya tha jota" 
 Therefore, in a very large part of ancient India, the head of the village was elected by the village community and he was appointed with the consent of the state
 rajya use bhoomikar na dene par hataa saktaa tha, yadhyapi yah pad vanshanugat tha tathaa isaki prapti ke liye janamat tathaa rajyasweekruti aavashyak thi
 Therefore, those who are not elected were different from present-day landlords
 pracheen bharat main bhoomi kaa sampatti ke rup main krayvikray sambhav nahin tha
 This fact has also been confirmed by Western scholars Baden Powell and Sir George Campbell
 campbell kaa kathan he ki bhoomi jotane kaa adhikaar ek adhikaar maatr hi tha or hindu vyavastha ke anusaar bhoomi nahin mana gaya tha
 It has been known by modern research that in ancient India, there were feudatories, overheads, bhogikas, Pratiharas and Dandanayaks
 ye log newnaadhik samantpratha ke anukool the
 But we have not been sure about their rights and duties, except that these people used to send troops to their owners when needed
 in adhikariyon ko paarishramik ke rup main bhoomi pradaan kii jaati thi
 According to Yajnavalkya regarding the land system, there were four classes, Mahipati, Kshetraswami, Krishak and Shikami
 acharya brihaspati ne kshetraswami ke sthaan main keval swami shabd kaa hi prayog kiya he parantu iskaa spashtikaran kar diya he ki swami, raja or khetihar ke madhya kaa varg tha
 The above description only indicates the classification of land holdings, and not to bring the farmer to the level of an Anglo slave
 mukhya prashn to yah he ki bhoomi par swatv adhikaar kisko - rajya ko, krishak ko athwa kisi madhyavarti varg ko vidwaanon ke matanusaar pracheen bharat main yah adhikaar hi tha jo swatv adhikaar nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We do not find any transformation in this ancient land during Yavana rule and neither is there any change in the basic principles of land-rights
 yavan shaasha bhoomikar gaanv ke mukhiya dwaara hi vasuul karte the or kabhi-kabhi sthaneey saradaaron vaa raajaaon dwaara, jo apana str gaanv ke mukhiya se unchaa hone kaa daawa karte the
 The claim of these kings appears to have produced an intermediate class between the state and the cultivator
 parantu samantvaad pad avrodh sthaayee rakhaa gaya tha kyonki rajya sarvada in raajaaon ko karmchaaree hi maanate the
 Although these kings were beginning to be hereditary, the state always had the right to grant and take back their post
 ek raja ke uttaradhikari ko raja kii sanad praapt karne ke liye prarthanapatr dena padataa tha or sanad kii prapti ke pashchaat hi vah raja hota tha
 In the Ainacabari, no intermediate class is recognized between the farmer and the state
 tathakthith raja or jameendaar saidhantik or vaastavik rup main keval kar vasuul karanevaale karmchaaree hi the
 It is notable that the Yavana rulers never claimed land-ownership-rights
 yah baat in aitihaasik tathyon se spasht he ki aurangzeb ne hundi, palam tathaa anya sthanon par krishakon se bhoomi kharidi thi, jaisaa akbar ne akbarabad or elahabaad main kile banane ke liye kiya tha
 Shah Jahan also did the same, it is proved from the above evidence that the Yavana rulers believed in property rights only in collecting taxes and not in the land
 unke shasankaal main krishak ke adhikaron ko ucchtam manyata di gai thi
 The farmer used to give it by the king and the head of the village and the king and the chief received remuneration for this work by the state
 san 1707 i0 main aurangzeb kii mrityu ke pashchaat krishakon ke adhikaron kaa lop dhire-dhire aarambh hua jab ki kendriya satta shithil padane lagi
 The sentiment of semi-feudal selfishness emerged during this time of monopoly
 jab rajya kii satta shithil padane lagi, rajya ke karmchaaree praja ke janmaal kii raksha karne main asamarth hone lage
 As a result, the villagers began to take the help of powerful employees and kings or chiefs for the protection
 in logon ne swabhaavat: sharnaarthi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron par akraman kiya
 Under these conditions, seedlings of Zamindari system are found
 parantu is sankatkaal main bhi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron kaa purna samarpan nahin hua tha
 Zamindari system started to emerge from the arrival of British in India
 angrej shaskaon kaa vishwaas tha ki ve bhoomi ke swami hai or krishak unki praja hai isaliye unhone sthaayee tathaa asthaayee bandobast bade krishakon tathaa raajaaon or jameendaaron se kiye
 Although impressed by the political rationale, he leased one pargana to the monopolist who collected every tax for five years
 is prakaar jameendaari pratha ko angrajon ne manyata pradaan kii yadhyapi aarambh main unka vichaar krishakon ko unke adhikaron se vanchit karne kaa nahin tha san 1786 i0 main lard corn walis, warren hestigaj ke baad, garvanar general hua
 Lord Cornwallis was also in favor of Zamindari system
 usne san 1791 i0 bengal, bihar tathaa urisa main das varshiya bandobast kii ajna di
 Two years later, the Board of Directors gave permission to make this ten-year plan a permanent settlement
 madras main jameendaari pratha kaa udai angrej shaskaon kii nilaam niti dwaara hua
 The lands of the villages were divided and auctioned and sold to the highest payer
 prarambh main avadh main bandobast krishak se hi kiya gaya tha parantu tadnantar raajnneetik kaarnon se yah bandobast jameendaaron se kiya gaya
 In the settlement report of the great historian Sir Vincent A
 Smith, Aligarh, it clearly acknowledges that the settlements were made to the monopolies, aiming only at utility, ignoring the prevailing land rights
 anyaaypurna karrashi ikattha karne kaa yah sabase saral upaay he tathaa yah raajnneeti ke drushtikon se bhi upyogi he kyonki iske falswaroop sarkaar kaa ek shaktishaalee tathaa dhani varg kii sahaayta milti rahegi
 Thus in the history of India for the first time these settlements established the class of landlords between the state and the farmers by the policy of the British, which resulted in the loss of the property rights of the farmers who had been in existence since time immemorial
 yah madhyavarti varg din prati din dhani hota gaya kyonki angrej shaasha apni karrashi main se adhik se adhik hissaa unhen pralobhan ke rup main dete rahe
 In these settlements, no attention was paid to the interests of the farmers, as a result of which their grief, humiliation and humiliation increased day by day
 kai baar angrej shaskaon ne bhi is ore dhyaan dilaayaa ki krishakon kii bhudhruti kii raksha kii jaay evam unka lagaan bandobast ke samay tak nirdhaarit kar diya jaay
 Still nothing was done
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej shaskaon kii dharna thi ki jameendaaron ke saath vyavhaar main udaartaa dikhaane par jab ve sampann evam santusht rahenge to ve apane asamiyon ko nahin sataayenge jiske falswaroop ve bhi khushhaal rahenge
 But this was his great mistake because the landlords always betrayed their duty
 at: angrej shaasha yah mahasoos karne lage ki is bhul kaa sudhaar kiya jaae
 As a result, they arranged land related legislation to improve the condition of the farmers
 yah kadam jameendaari pratha ke ast kii disha main pratham charan kaha ja saktaa he
 In this first phase, which lasted from 1859 AD to 1929 AD, the laws that were enacted imposed certain restrictions on the rights of landlords to increase the rent and also benefited the higher class farmers
 kintu in kanoonon kaa mukhya uddeshy jameendaaron ko lagaan vasuul karne main sahuuliyat dene kaa tha jisase ve rajya ko rajasav thik samay par de saken
 In 1859 AD, the first land related act was passed
 yah adhinium samast british bharat ke liye ek adarsh bhoomi-adhinium tha jiske anuroop adhinium bharat ke sabhi bhaagon main paas hue or samay samay par unamem sanshodhan bhi kiye gaye taaki asantusht krishakon ko shant kiya ja sake
 But the landlords still continued to squeeze the peasants to recover their just and unjust taxes, which caused widespread dissatisfaction and restlessness among the farmers
 jameendaari pratha ke ast ke kram main doosraa charan san 1930 i0 se 1944 i0 tak rahaa
 During this time, peasant movements started happening all over the country
 in andolanon kaa beej ek kisaan sabha ne boyaa tha jo akhil bhartiya congress kii elahabaad baithak main taarikh 11 farvari san 1918 i0 ko hui thi
 After that the Congress started to advance the interests of the farmers
 parinaam swaroop gramin janata main kaaphi jagrati paidaa ho gai
 Pt
 Jawaharlal Neh degree announced in the U
P
 Congress Committee on 27 October 1928 that political freedom is meaningless till the farmers get freedom from exploitation
 shanai: shanai: kisaanon kii jaagrukta badi or saath hi saath unki vyakulata bhi
 The peasant class became more vocal and demanded the stability of land holdings and reduction in revenue
 kisaan andolanon se prabhavit hokar raiyyatwarikshetron main nae adhinium banaae gaye jinase krishakon ke hiton kii raksha ho sake
 The Malabar Tenancy Act is a landmark in this regard
 iske baad bhopal land revenue act, 1935 tathaa assam tenency act 1935 paas hue
 Under the Government of India Act, 1935, when the 'special Autonomy' was inaugurated, the Provincial Governments arranged Land Reforms Acts which gave more rights to the farmers and curtailed the rights of the landlords
 you0 pi0 tenency act, 1939, tathaa bombai tenency act, 1939 vishisht udhaaharan aise vyapak adhiniyamon ke hai jinke dwaara krishakon ko maurusi adhikaar die gaye evam krishakon ke hit main jameendaaron ke katipay adhikaar chin liye gaye
 Even after the enactment of these Land Reforms Acts, the evils of the Zamindari system existed, although the Zamindars were paralyzed to a large extent
 in jameendaaron ko neh degree ji ‘british sarkaar kii atilaalit santan ’ kaha karte the
 He was a symbol of the past feudalistic practice which was completely contrary to modern conditions
 isliye indian neshnal congress ne kai baar is baat kii ghoshnaa kii ki jameendaari unmoolan ko congress ke kaarykram main pramukh sthaan dena chahie
 a farmer conference date was held on 27, 28 April 1935 in Allahabad under the chairmanship of Sardar Patel
 usne jameendaari unmoolan ko prastaav paas karke is ore ek pramukh kadam uthaaya is prastaav main yah ghoshnaa kii gai thi ki ‘gramakalyaan ke drushtikon se vartmaan jameendaari pratha bilkul vipareet he
 This practice was brought in the arrival of British rule and rural life has been completely destroyed by this'
 parantu san 1939 i0 main dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru ho jane ke kaaran bhoomi sudhaar kaa sara kaarykram ruuk gaya
 After the end of the war, the last phase of the end of Zamindari system started which lasted from 1945 to 1955
 yuddh samaapt hote hi british sarkaar ne 1945 i0 main government of india act 1935 i0 ke antargat prantiy sadanon ke chunaav karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Congress decided to participate in the elections and in December 1945 took out the election manifesto
 is ghoshnaptr main jameendaari unmoolan ke vishay main spashtatya kaha gaya ki ‘bhoomi vyavastha kaa sudhaar, jisaki bharat main ati aavashyaktaa he, krishakon tathaa rajyake bich madhyavarti varg ko hataane se sambandhit he
 Therefore the rights of this intermediate class should be obtained by giving proper compensation '
 is ghoshnaa patr se arthshaastri, raajnneetijna tathaa patrkaar sabhi sahamat the
 Zamindari system hindered Indian economic development because the big landlords were always advocates of reactionism
 ‘landan iconomist’ ne inke vishay main likhaa tha ki ‘inamen se adhiktar ‘thekarase’ ke paatr ‘lard steen’ kii tarah dushcharitra, ‘jine astine’ ke ‘mistar benet’ kii tarah aalsee, ‘surtijasquaire’ kii tarah sharaabi the 
 The Bengal Land Commission also came to the conclusion that 'permanent settlement of 1793 AD, for whatever reasons was deemed appropriate at that time, is unsuitable in today's situation and has created so many evils in the zamindari system that it is no longer in the interest of the nation Even the type is no longer useful
 ’ bhartiya tathaa paashchaatya arthvettaon kii raay main jameendaari unmoolan adhik krishi utpaadan ke liye atyaavashyak he
 In addition, this practice has ended in every part of the world due to lack of time
 punasch, yah pratha rajya ke liye adhik kharchili he
 Above all, this practice had reached such a state at this time that if it had not been eradicated, it would have caused disasters not only on national economic problem but also on social security
 at: san 1946 i0 main chunaav main safalataa ke falswaroop jab har praant main congress mantrimandal bane to chunaav pratigya ke anusaar jameendaari pratha ko samaapt karne ke liye vidheyak prastut kiye gaye
 These Bills became Act from 1950 to 1955, which resulted in the abolition of Zamindari system in India and re-established direct relations between farmers and the state
 bhoomi ke swatvadhikaar ab krishakon ko waapas mil gaye jinka upyog ve anadi paramparaagat kaal se karte chale aae the
 In this way, the zamindari system that emerged with the arrival of the British in our country also ended at the end of their rule
 is pratha kii samaapti par kisi ne tanik bhi shok prakat nahin kiya, kyonki iskaa vinaash hote hi puraane siddhant kii, jiske anusaar bhoomi kaa swami krishak hota tha, punrariti hui
 Which was the end of the Zamidari system on 02 / 10 / 1951, Gwalior princely state in Madhya Pradesh also had the system of zamindari, which was dominated by Gwalior princely state of Agar Susner etc

 apatat rodhika ek pramukh sagariya jal krit niksheptmak sthalarup hai
 The story that Jayalakshmi told the thirty-first effigy is as follows - As big a king as King Vikramaditya was, an ascetic
 unhone apane tap se jaan liya ki ve ab adhik se adhik chha: maheene ji sakate hai
 Considering his death as imminent, he got a hut built in the forest and started spending time left in the practice
 ek din rajmahal se kutiyaa kii taraf aa rahe the ki unki nazar ek mrug par padi
 The deer was amazing and Vikram had never seen such an antelope
 unhone dhanush haath main lekar doosraa haath tarkash main daalaa hi tha ki mrug unke sameep aakar manushya kii boli main unase apane praanon kii bheekh maangane laga
 Vikram was surprised to see the antelope speaking like humans and his hand automatically stopped
 vikram ne us mrug se poocha ki vah manushyon kii tarah kaise bol letaa he to vah bolaa ki yah sab unke darshan ke prabhaav se hua he
 Vikram's curiosity increased now
 unhone us mrug ko poocha ki aisa kyon hua to usne bataanaa shuru kiya
 "I am not a born antelope
 meraa janm maanav kul main ek raja ke yahan hua
 Like other princes, i too was very fond of hunting
 shikaar ke liye main apane ghode par bahut dur tak ghaney jangalon main ghus jaataa tha
 One day i got the impression of being a deer at some distance and i ran a gun aiming at the voice
 darasal vah awaz ek sadhnarat yogi kii thi jo bahut dhimen swar main mantrocchar kar rahaa tha
 The arrow did not hit him, but touching his temple, Puro quickly entered the trunk of a tree
 main apane shikaar ko khojate-khojate vahaan tak pahunchaa to pataa chalaa mujhase kaisaa anisht hone se batch gaya
 There was an obstacle in the yogi's practice
 isliye vah kaaphi cruddh ho gaya tha
 When he found me standing in front of him, he understood that he had run the car
 usne laal aankhon se ghoorte hue mujhe shraap de diya
 He said- "O foolish young man who likes hunting of deer, be an antelope from today itself
" aaj ke baad se akhetakon se apane praanon kii raksha karata rah
 " usne shraap itani jaldi de diya ki mujhe apni safaai main kuch kehane kaa mauka nahin mila
 i trembled with fear of the curse
 main yogi ke pairon par gir padaa tathaa usase shraap mukt karne kii prarthana karne laga
 i cried crying and told him that i had no intention of disturbing his practice and all this happened to me unknowingly
 meri aankhon main pashchaatap ke ansu dekhakar us yogi ko dayaa aa gai
 He told me that the curse cannot be withdrawn, but he can definitely limit the effect of that curse
 maine kaha ki jitna adhik sambhav he utana vah shraap kaa prabhaav kam kar de to usne kaha- "tum mrug banakar tab tak bhatakate rahoge jab tak mahaan yashasvi raja vikramaditya ke darshan nahin ho jaaen
 With the philosophy of Vikramaditya, you will start speaking like human beings
 " Vikram now got curious that he is speaking like humans but has not changed into a human being
 unhone usase poocha- "tumhen mrug rup se kab mukti milegi? kab tum apane vaastavik rup ko praapt karoge? The cursed prince said- "even this will give me freedom very soon
 us yogi ke kathananusaar main agar aapako saath lekar uske paas jaaon to meraa vaastavik rup mujhe turant hi waapas mil jayega
 " vikram khush the ki unke haath se shapagrast rajkumaar kii hatya nahin hui anyathaa unhen nirparaadh manushya kii hatya kaa paap lag jaataa or ve glani tathaa pashchaatap kii aag main jal rahe hote
 He asked the Mrigrupi prince- "do you know anything about the residence of that yogi? Can you take me to him?" us rajkumaar ne kaha- "haan, main aapako uski kutiyaa tak abhi liye chal saktaa hoon
 Incidentally, that yogi is still practicing a little distance in this forest
 " The antelope went ahead and Vikram followed him
 thodi dur chalane ke pashchaat unhen ek vriksh par ulataa hokar sadhana karata ek yogi dikhaa
 He understood that the prince was referring to this yogi
 ve jab sameep aae to vah yogi unhen dekhte hi vriksh se utarkar sidhaa khadaa ho gaya
 He greeted Vikram and thanked him for giving darshan
 vikram samaj gaye ki vah yogi unki hi pratiksha kar rahaa tha
 But he got curious why he was waiting for them
 poochne par usne unhen bataaya ki sapane main ek din indra dev ne unhen darshan dekar kaha tha ki maharaja vikramaditya ne apane karmon se devataaon-sa sthaan praapt kar liya he tathaa unke darshan praapt karne vaale ko indra dev yaa anya devataaon ke darshan kaa fal praapt hota he
 "I was working so hard to get the benefit of your philosophy
 "- us yogi ne kaha
 Vikram asked if he got his darshan now, does he want anything else from him
 is par yogi ne unase unke gale main padi indra dev ke muunge vaali maala maangi
 The king gladly gave the garland to him
 yogi ne unka aabhaar prakat kiya hi tha ki shraapit rajkumaar phir se maanav ban gaya
 He first touched the feet of Vikram and then the yogi
 rajkumaar ko lekar vikram apane mahal aae
 On the second day, his kingdom made him sit on his chariot
 magar uske rajya main pravesh karte hi sainikon kii tukdi ne unke rath ko chaaron ore se gher liya tathaa rajya main pravesh karne kaa unka prayojan poochne lage
 The prince introduces himself and asks to leave the way
 usne jaananaa chaha ki uskaa rath rokane kii sainikon ne himmat kaise kii
 The soldiers told him that his parents had been imprisoned and now someone else had control over this state
 chunki rajya par adhikaar karte vakt rajkumaar kaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa, isliye chaaron taraf guptchar uski talash main failaa die gayi the
 Now his own presence has paved the way for the new ruler
 raja vikramaditya ne unhen apana parichay nahin diya or khud ko rajkumaar ke doot ke rup main pesh karte hue kaha ki unka ek sandesh naye shaasha tak bheja jaae
 He told the hero of that troop that there are two options before the new ruler - either he surrenders his kingdom to the real king and queen, or prepares for war
 us senanayake ko bad ajeeb laga
 He ridiculed Vikram and asked who would go to war
 kya vahi donon yuddh karenge
 Seeing him ridiculing, his anger reached the seventh sky
 unhone talwaar nikaali or uskaa sar dhad se alag kar diya
 Army panicked
 kisi ne daudkar nae shaasha ko khabar kii
 He immediately ran towards them with the army
 vikram is hamale ke liye taiyaar baithe the
 He remembered both the hospitals and after receiving their orders, the hospitals lifted the chariot into the air
 unhone vah tilak lagaaya jisase adrishy ho sakate the or rath se kud gayi
 While invisible, he started cutting enemies like carrot-radish
 jab saikado sainik maare gaye or dushman nazar nahin aayaa to sainikon main bhagdad much gai or raja ko vahiin chhod adhikansh sainik rankshetra se bhaag khadey hue
 He felt that some vampiric power was against him
 nae shaasha kaa cheharaa dekhne laayak tha
 He was surprised and frightened as well, looking desperate
 use hatprabh dekh vikram ne apni talwaar uski gardan par rakh di tathaa apane vaastavik rup main aa gaye
 He introduced himself to that ruler and said that he should either leave this state and run away or be ready for life
 vah shaasha vikramaditya kii shakti se parichit tha tathaa unka shaury aankhon se dekh chukaa tha, at: vah usee kshan us rajya se bhaag gaya
 He returned to his kingdom by returning the real king and queen to his kingdom
 raste main ek jangal padaa
 An antelope came to them in that forest and asked them to save themselves from a lion
 magar maharaja vikramaditya ne uski madad nahin kii
 They could not go against the law made by God

 Thinking that he allowed Singh to hunt the deer

 Singing, playing and dancing are all three musicals

 bajaane or baaje kii kala aadmi ne kuch baad main khoji-sikhi ho, par gane or naachne kaa aarambh to na keval hazaron balki lakhon varsh pehle usne kar liya hoga, isamen andeh nahin
 Anthem is almost as natural to human as speech
 kab se manushya ne gaanaa prarambh kiya, yah batalaana utana hi kathin he jitna ki kab se usne bolnaa prarambh kiya
 But after a long time, his anthem took shape
 jab swar or lay vyavasthit rup dhaaran karte hai tab ek kala kaa pradurbhaav hota he or is kala ko sangeet, mujeec yaa mausiiki kehete hai
 Humans have been using the playing of songs during war, festivities and prayers or bhajans
 sansar main sabhi jatiyon main baansuri ityadi phunk ke vaadya, kuch taar yaa taant ke vaadya, kuch chamade se madhe hue vaadya, kuch thonkkar bajaane ke vaadya milte hai
 It seems that till the time of Bharata in India, the anthem was earlier only called 'geet'
 vaadya main jahaan geet nahin hota tha, keval daada, diddid jaise shushk akshar hote the, vahaan use 'nirgeet' yaa 'bahirgeet' kehete the or nritt athwa nrity kii ek alag kala thi
 But gradually the three songs, instruments and dances became intertwined with the "music" - songs, instruments and dances of the trio
 bharat se baahar anya deshon main keval geet or vaadya ko sangeet main ginate hai; nrity ko ek bhinn kala maanate hai
 In India also, dance is counted in music only because it is accompanied by an equal song or instrument or both
 upar likhaa ja chukaa he ki swar or lay kii kala ko sangeet kehete hai
 Vowel and rhythm are found in both song and instrument, but in dance there is only rhythm, not tone
 ham sangeet ke antargat keval geet or vaadya kii charchaa karenge, kyonki sangeet keval isi arth main anya deshon main bhi vyavahrut hota he
 The primary source of music is natural sounds
 prak sangeet-yug main manushya ke prakruti kii dhvaniyon or unki vishisht lay ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 Not all types of natural sounds can be the basis of music, so an attempt has been made to test the sounds that produce the emotion and to tie them to the rhythm
 prakruti kii ve dhvaniyaan jinhone manushya ke man-mastishk ko sparsh kar ullasit kiya, vahi sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath sangeet kaa saadhan baniin
 Though thinkers have different opinions
 darshanikon ne naad ke chaar bhaagon para, pashyanti, madhyamaa or vaikhari main se madhyamaa ko sangitopayogi swar kaa aadhaar mana
 Darwin said that animals sound sweet at the time of the rati
 manushya ne jab is prakaar kii dhwani kaa anukaran armbh kiya to sangeet kaa udbhav hua
 Karl Stumpf considered the singularity of sound by humans after the genesis of language to be the origin of vowels
 unnisvin shatee ke uttararddh main bharatendu harishchandr ne kaha ki ‘‘sangeet kii utpatti maanviya samvednaa ke saath hui
 He described music as a set of songs, playing, telling and dancing
 praachya shastron main sangeet kii utpatti ko lekar anek rochak kathaayen hai
 Devraj used to be a singer, player and dancer in Indra's meeting
 gandharv gaate the, apsaraayen nrity karti thim or kinnar vaadya bajaate the
 The song has been predominant in gandharva-kala
 aadi main gaan tha, vaadya kaa nirmaan peeche hua
 The song was a staple
 yahi kaaran he ki chaahe geet ho, chaahe vaadya sabakaa naam sangeet pad gaya
 Dance from behind also took its form
 sansar kii jitani arya bhashaayen hai unamem sangeet shabd achche prakaar se gane ke arth main miltaa he
 The word 'music' is made of metal
 anya bhashaaon main ‘san’ kaa ‘sin’ ho gaya he or ‘gai’ yaa ‘ga’ dhaatu kisi na kisi rup main isi arth main anya bhashaaon main bhi vartmaan he
 In anglo-saxon it is translated 'singan' which has become 'sing' in modern English, in Icelandic it is 'sig', in Danish it is 'sing', in Dutch it is 'sing', in Dutch it is 'tsingen', in German it is 'singen' 
 arabi main ‘gana’ shabd he jo ‘gaan’ se purnatah miltaa he
 In the first 'sangitaratnakar' text, the combination of singing, playing and dancing is called 'sangeet'
 vastutah ‘geet’ shabd main ‘sam’ jodakar ‘sangeet’ shabd bana, jiskaa arth he ‘gaan sahit’
 The anthem performed with dance and playing is 'sangeet'
 shastron main sangeet ko sadhana bhi mana gaya he
 Authentically, the remains of most ancient civilizations, statues, postures and frescoes reveal that people were familiar with music thousands of years ago
 dev-devi ko sangeet kaa aadi prerak sirf hamaare hi desh main nahin mana jaataa, europe main bhi yah vishwaas rahaa he
 The mystery is revealed by paying attention to the words for music in Europe, Arabia and Persia
 sangeet ke liye unani bhashaa main shabd ‘mausiki’, latin main ‘musika’, francisi main ‘musik’, portugi main ‘musika’, german main moosik’, angreji main ‘mujeec’, ibrani, arabi or farsi main ‘mosiki’
 All these words are equitable
 ye sabhi shabd unani bhashaa ke ‘mus’ shabd se bane hai
 'muse' is considered the goddess of poetry and music in the Greek tradition
 kosh main ‘mus’ shabd kaa arth diya he ‘di insapiring godes of saang’ arthath ‘gaan kii prerica devi’
 In the Greek tradition, 'muse' is considered the daughter of "jyaus"
 jyos’ shabd sanskrit ke ‘dyus’ kaa hi roopaantar he jiskaa arth he ‘swarg’
 The conception of 'jyaus' and 'muse' is very similar to Brahma and Saraswati
 bhartiya sangeet kaa janm veda ke uccharan main dekha ja saktaa he
 The oldest book of music is the Natyashastra of Bharata Muni
 anya granth hai: brihaddeshi, dattilam, sangitaratnakar
 Music is very important for us

 Due to which his attention is removed from the pain

 Listening to music causes higher dopamine levels in the brain

 According to US scientists, music therapy is good for the lungs

 But serious respiratory diseases cannot be cured by this

 And the brain starts working much better

 According to scientists, listening to music for 30 minutes daily increases the capacity of the heart

 Listening to good music breaks the useless thoughts going on inside the brain
 or raat ke samay dimag puraa khaali ho jane se acchhee neend aati he
 Generally people who do not sleep should listen to good songs for some time before going to sleep

 mysore narsinhachaar shrinivas bharat ke suprasiddh samajashastri the
 He worked on caste and caste system, social stratification, culturalization and westernization in South India
 unhone 'prabal jati' kii avdhaaran prastut kii
 'mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas' was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the field of science and engineering by the Government of India in 1977
 ye karnataka se hai
 Even though the Adivasis of Indian Sociology may not be formalized, they have enriched this discipline in independent India with their theoretical contributions, unique understanding of caste and the method of participatory observation that they have given to the top sociologists of the country
 Enough to include
 samajashaastra main unhen samskruthikaran, prabhutvshaalee jati or vot bank jaisi moulik prasthaapanaaon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Srinivas was also the creator of the institutions
 baroda or dilli vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke vibhaagon kii sthapana kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 His contribution to the development of Indian sociology will also be considered as classical in terms of establishing and guiding high-level institutions of research and study
 gramin samudaay or jati kii sanrachana ke vishisht adhyayan ke alaava em
en
 shrinivas ne vigyaan ke saamaajik prabhaav, gandhi ke dharmik chintan, maanavshaastra ke itihaas se lekar gender jaise vishyon par bhi vicharottejak kaam kiya he
 Srinivas's work is considered to be a rare confluence of objective supervision, fineness of analysis and theoretical depth
 unka lekhan antar-vishyaktaa ko ek khaas tarah kaa jamini sandarbh pradaan karata he
 Srinivas's sociological vision explores the external structure of events and fathoms the structures and historical forces that compose them
 saamudayik jivan ke baarik byoron or antardrushtiyon ko saral bhashaa main prastut karne kii unki kshamta unhen samakaleen samajashastriyon se ek alag vyaktitv pradaan karti he
 In this sense, they transcend the thematic vocabulary and choose the simple and popular language
 ise unki vidvatta kaa janawaad hi kaha jayega ki unki saidhantik avadharanaayen apane kutarthon main uljhane ke bajaay vishay ko samajhane main zyaada madad karti hai
 Srinivas created a new land for Indian sociology at the level of ideology
 ullekhneey he ki jis daur main shrinivas bhartiya samaaj ke adhyayan kii taiyaari kar rahe the us samay samaaj-vigyaanon par america or british academik prasthapanaayen haaavee thi
 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence

 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country
 jati ke is adhyayan main shrinivas kshetreey bhinnataaon or pashchimi shiksha, prashasnic naukari, shahar se milane vaali aay jaise karkon kaa bhi ullekh karte hai jinka jati kii sanrachana par vyapak asar padaa he
 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions
 or saath hi dyumon jaise samajashastri kii manyataon kaa bhi pratwaad kiya jo yah pratipaadit kar rahe the ki jatigat vibhinnataayen bhartiya gaanv ko samudaay kaa rup nahin lene detii
 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he
 In a nutshell, Srinivas's work provides many basic arguments in the Western discourse of philosophical propositions, perceptions of self, community and nation

 kautilya kaa 'arthshaastra' raajnneetik siddhanton kii ek mahatvapurn kriti he
 In this connection, the question arises why Kautilya named his book 'arthashastra'? In ancient times the term 'arthashastra' was used in a broader sense
 iske antagart multah raajnneetishastra, dharamshastra, arthshaastra, kanoon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa tha
 In the view of Acharya Kautilya, political science is an independent science and its branches are investigation, trilogy and dialogue and law
 sampoorn samaaj kii raksha raajnneeti yaa dand vyavastha se hoti he yaa rakshit praja hi apane-apane karttavya kaa paalan kar sakati he
 At that time economics was considered the scripture of politics and administration
 mahabharat main is sambandh main ek prasang he, jisamen arjuna ko arthshaastra kaa visheshgy mana gaya he
 Certainly, Kautilya's Arthashastra would also have been taken as a form of Rajashastra, as he has given many interpretations of the meaning
 kautilya ne kaha he— manuyana vrutirarthah arthath manushyon kii jeevika ko 'arth' kehete hai
 Explaining the Arthashastra, he has said - Tasya Prithivya Gnanapalanopaya: Shastra marth-shastramiti
 is prakaar yah bhi spasht he ki 'arthshaastra' ke antargat rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha donon se sambandhit siddhanton kaa samavesh he
 In fact, it would not be appropriate to call Kautilya 'arthashastra' only a scripture of polity and economy
 vastav main, yah arthvyavastha, rajvyastha, vidhi vyavastha, samaaj vyavastha or dharm vyavastha se sambandhit shaastra he
 Many other Arthasastras were composed before Kautilya's 'arthashastra', although his manuscripts are not available
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi arth, kaam or dharm ke sanyog or sammilan ke liye prayaas kiye jate rahe hai or uske liye shastron, smritiyon or puraanon main vishad charchaayen kii gayi hai
 Kautilya has also explained the meaning of 'arthashastra', measures of attainment of Artha, Kama and Dharma
 vatsyayan ke 'kamasutra' main bhi arth, dharm or kaam ke sambandh main sutron kii rachana kii gayi he
 Kautilya himself has also accepted the creation of his earlier economics
 apane 'arthshaastra' main kai sandarbhon main usne acharya brihaspati, bharadwaj, shukracharya, parashar, pishun, vishalaksh aadi aacharyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Prior to Kautilya, the texts of many Acharyas are named as Dandaniti
 aisa prathit hota he ki kautilya ke purv shaastra dandniti kahe jate the or ve arthshaastra ke samroop hote the
 But as many scholars have admitted that both politics and economics are not identical
 you
 en
 ghoshaal ke kathananusaar arthshaastra zyada vyapak shaastra he, jabaki dandniti maatr uski shakha he
 The scriptures written after Kautilya became known as 'niti Shastra', like Kamandaka Niti'sar
 vaise kai vidwaanon ne arthshaastra ko nitishastra kii apeksha zyada vyapak mana he
 However, in the opinion of most scholars, both ethics and economics are similar and both have the same subject area
 swayan kaamandak ne nitishastra or arthshaastra ko samroop mana he
 It is clear from the above discussion that scriptures like 'arthashastra' were composed before and after Kautilya's 'arthashastra'
 is sambandh main aise vidwaanon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya he jo yah maanate hai ki kautilya 'arthshaastra' kaa rachanaakaar nahin tha
 The number of Western scholars is more among such scholars
 sten, jolly, winternij va kith is prakaar ke vichaar ke pratipadak hai
 Indian scholar R
 G
 Bhandarkar has also supported this
 bhandarkar ne kaha he ki patanjali ne mahabhashya main kautilya kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 Those who did not recognize Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra', have presented the following arguments in support of their view- pustak kii samaapti par spasht rup se likhaa gaya he- It has also been written: vishnu puraana main is ghatana kii charchaa is tarah kii gai he: Confirming the incident, Kamantak, the doer of 'nitisara', wrote: in uddharanon se spasht he ki vishnugupt or kautilya ek hi vyakti the
 In the 'arthashastra' itself, at the end of the tenth chapter of the second tribunal, the name of the author of the book is named 'kautilya': pustak ke armbh main ‘kautilyon kruthan shastram’ tathaa prayek adhyay ke ant main ‘iti kautilierthshastre’ likhakar granthkaar ne apane ‘kautilya naam ko adhik vikhyath kiya he
 Wherever the opinion of other Acharyas has been expressed, in the end there is 'iti Kautilya' i
e
 Kautilya's opinion - saying thus has shown more favor to the name Kautilya
 parantu yah sarvatha nirvivaad he ki vishnugupt tathaa kautilya abhinn vyakti the
 If the later Dandi poet called it Acharya Vishnugupta, Banabhatta called it Kautilya
 donon kaa kathan he ki is acharya ne ‘dandniti’ athwa ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana kii
 In the Panchatantra, the name of this Acharya has been given as Chanakya, the author of economics
 kavi vishakhdutt-pranit suprasiddh naatak ‘mudrarakshas’ main chanakya ko kabhi kautilya tathaa kabhi vishnugupt naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 'arthashastra' was created for the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta as a 'rule of law'
 at: isaki rachana kaa kaal vahi maananaa uchit he, jo samraat chandragupta kaa kaal he
 Archaeological scholars dated this period to 321 BC
 From 296 BC Till sure
 kai anya vidwaan samraat cendrakotus ke aadhaar par nishchit kii hui is tithi ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Sukhya Moolam Dharma: dharmasy mulan arthh
 Meaning states
 rajyasy mulan indriya jayah
 Indriyajasya Moolam Vinayah
 vinayasy mulan vridhopaseva
sukh kaa mul he, dharm
 Meaning of religion is Artha
 arth kaa mul he, rajya
 The root of the kingdom is victory over the senses
 indriyajay kaa mul he, vinay
 The core of Vinay is service to the aged
 jaise upar kaha gaya he, iskaa mukhya vishay shashan-vidhi athwa shashan-vigyaan he: ‘‘kautilyon narendrarthey shashansy vidhi: krit:
 "it is clear from these words that Acharya composed it as a method of political science and especially governance
 arthshaastra kii vishay-suchi ko dekhne se yah sarvatha pramanit ho jaataa he ki ise aajkal kahe jane vaale arthshaastra kii pustak kahana bhul he
 At the beginning of the first tribunal itself, Acharya himself has informed it by the name 'dandaniti'
 shukracharya ne dandniti ko itani mahatvapurn vidya batalaaya he ki isamen anya sab vidyaon kaa antarbhaav maan liya he- kyonki 'shastren rakshite deshe shastrachintaa pravartate' kii ukti ke anusaar shastr dwaara sushasit tathaa surakshit desh main hi veda aadi anya shastron kii chintaa yaa anushilan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to accept penalism as the basic discipline of all other disciplines, and the same punishment is economics
 jise aajkal arthshaastra kaha jaataa he, uske liye 'vaarta' shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, yadhyapi yah shabd purnataya arthshaastra kaa dyotak nahin
 Kautilya has said three parts of the dialogue - agriculture, commerce and animal husbandry, from which often the profession or livelihood was earned
 manu, yajyavlky aadi shaastrakaron ne bhi in teen angon vaale vaartashastra ko sweekaar kiya he
 Shukracharya has also included Kusid in this dialogue as a means of instinct
 parantu arthshaastra ko sabhi shaastrakaron ne dandniti, raajnneeti athwa shashanvigyaan ke rup main hi varnit kiya he
 Therefore, it would be better to consider 'kautilya Arthashastra' as a book of politics and not a book of wealth
 vaise isamen kahin-kahin sampattishastra ke dhanotpaadan, dhanopbhog tathaa dhan-vinimay, dhan-vibhaajan aadi vishyon kii bhi praasangik charchaa kii gai he
 The opening verse of the first tribunal of 'kautilya Arthashastra' is going to throw more light in this regard: arthath-pracheen aacharyon ne prithvi jeetne or paalan ke upaay batalaane vaale jitne arthshaastra likhe hai, praayah un sabakaa saar lekar is ek arthshaastra kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Where this quote explains the subject of economics, it also illuminates the truth that before the 'kautilya Arthashastra', many masters composed the Arthashastra, which was intended to propose measures for conquering the earth and its observance
 un aacharyon tathaa unke sampradaayon ke kuch naamon kaa nirdesan ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main kiya gaya he, yadhyapi unki kritiyaan aaj uplabdh bhi nahin hotin
 This name is the following: arthshaastra ke in das sampradaayon ke aacharyon main praaia: sabhi ke sambandh main kuch-na-kuch gyaat he, parantu vishalaksh ke bare main bahut kam parichay praapt hota he
 It is very clear from these names that many great thinkers and philosophers got attention towards economics ethics and a bright literature was produced on this subject
 aaj vah sahitya lupt ho chukaa he
 Due to many foreign invasions and state revolutions, this literature has remained nameless, but whatever literature is residual indicates a wide economical tradition
 is arthshaastra main ek aisi shashan-paddati kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he jisamen raja yaa shaasha praja kaa kalyaan sampaadan karne ke liye shashan karata he
 The king cannot rule arbitrarily
 use mantriparishad kii sahaayta praapt karke hi praja par shashan karnaa hota he
 The state-priest is like a curse on the king, who can control the king if he is disinherited from the religious path and can force him to perform his duty
 sarvalokahitkaari raashtra kaa jo swaroop kautilya ko abhipret he, vah ‘arthshaastra’ ke nimnlikhit vachan se spasht he- That is, the happiness of the king is in the happiness of the people, it is in the interest of the people
 raja kaa apana priy kuch nahin he, praja kaa priy hi uskaa priy he
 Around 400 CE, Kamandaka wrote an Arthashastra based on Kautilya's Arthashastra, a poetic form divided into 20 cantos called Kamandikeya Nitisara
 yah naitikta or videsh-niti ke siddhanton par bhi vichaar karata he
 The ethics of Somdev Suri, the short economics of Hemachandra, the Yuktikalpataru of Bhoja, the Venus of Venus, etc
 are some other well-known economics, which can also be counted under texts explaining the practical side of ethics

 Employers, who were concerned that they could not plan their requirement of employees, pressurized the Congress
 In 2007, on behalf of the expanded visa program on Capitol Hill, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates made the statement that "if employers cannot import skilled employees to meet work requirements, then this is a sign of danger"
 Considered a bill to deal with the shortage, but the program was not eventually revised

 Taxation of income for H-1B employees depends on whether they are categorized as non-resident external citizens or as resident external citizens for tax purposes
 For tax purposes, a non-resident foreign citizen is taxed only on income from the United States, whereas for a tax resident, a resident foreign citizen is taxed for income from both within or outside the United States

 It is generally set at 65,000 visas per year, with some exceptions for employees working in exempted institutions, such as universities and colleges
 In 2000, the Congress permanently exempted the quota for H-1B visas granted to universities and government research laboratories

 Although by the mid-1990s, this quota had to be filled on a first-come-first-served basis every year, resulting in new H-1B visa applications being rejected or delayed as the annual quota was already filled
 san 1998 main yah kota badhaakar pehle 115,000 or phir san 2000 main, 195,000 visa prativarsh kiya gaya
 During the years during which this quota was 195,000, this number could never be reached

 Recent H-1B laws make it necessary for specific employers, called H-1B dependent employers, to advertise for those positions before filing a petition to appoint H-1B employees to any positions

 Another criticism of the H-1B program is its ambiguous qualification requirements, but the specific guidelines, approved by a committee of circumstantial method, define the requirements

 According to Ron Hiera, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the salary mean for the new H-1B information technology in 2005 was only $ 50,000, which is BS

 When an ex-employee named Guy Santiglia filed complaints in the US Department of Justice and the US Department of Labor alleging that the Santa Clara establishment discriminated against US nationals in favor of foreign employees over H-1B visas Goes, then in 2002, the US government began investigating the appointment methods of Sun Microsystems
 In late 2001, when the company fired 3,900 employees and applied for thousands of visas at the same time, Santaglia accused the company of discriminating against US citizens
 He said that in 2002, about 5 percent of the 39,000 Sun employees had temporary work visas

 The costs that come to a company to apply for an H1-B visa can be significant and can range between $ 1,440 and $ 5,000, since those petitioners since President Obama signed the Public Law 111-230 statute , Who have employed 50 or more employees in the United States and who have more than 50 percent of their employees in the United States since 14 August 2010 The H1B fee has been increased by $ 2000 for ch1-b or l non-immigrant status, depending on the attorneys' fees, the number of employees in the company, and whether the faster premium service Was paid for and does not include the cost of a possible tour to the extent of the country of origin and the cost of recycling

 In addition, if the employer has to sack the employee, the company will have to pay any reasonable costs that will again come to the employee in transporting himself or his dependents to their last foreign residence

 Although immigration usually requires short-term and long-term visitors to relinquish any longing to obtain a green card, H-1B visa holders are an important exception in the sense that the dual-purpose principle names The concept known as H-1B has been legally recognized as a possible step towards green cards

 iske kaaran ech1-bi visa dharak dwaara apane niyokta ke prati dabaavpurn vafadari ke ek tatv kaa nirmaan hua
 Critics allege that this coercive loyalty benefits employers because it reduces the risk that an H-1B employee will leave their job and start working for a competitor, and this allows civilian employees to get jobs
 There is a loss in the market because the employer is less assured that the citizen stays in his job for an extended period of time Singing, especially if working conditions are tough, wages are lower or working too hard or complicated
 It has been argued that this makes the H1-B visa program highly attractive to employers and labor laws in this context have been influenced by trade groups striving to obtain such benefits

 If an H-1B employee is fired from the job for any reason, the H-1B program does not technically mention any time allowance or grace period for the person preparing to leave, even if he or she is H- Why should 1B employee have been living in USA for any period of time

 Some confusion about the "grace period" arises because an H-1B employee is granted a grace period of 10 days to leave the United States at the end of his or her authorized term of residence
 This grace period only applies if the employee works until the H-1B expiration date listed in their I-797 or I-94 card permission notice

 In the context of social change, the basic belief of the social cycle is that the pace and direction of social change is like a cycle and hence social change starts from where it ends, after turning around at the end and reaching there

 In his cyclical theory of social change, Wilfredo Pareto has tried to show how the political, economic and spiritual sphere changes at a cyclical pace

 The classes which are in the upper part of the social structure, due to their corruption over time, fall from their rank and status, ie

 On the other hand, those who are intelligent, skilled, characterful and capable people in the lower class to fill those empty places, they go from bottom to top
 is prakaar ucch varg kaa nimna varg main aane yaa uskaa vinaash hone or nimna varg kaa ucch varg main jane kii prakriya chakree dhang se chalati rahati he
 Due to this cyclical motion, the social structure is changed or social change takes place

 The cyclical change in the political arena is dynamic when governance comes into the hands of the people of that class in which the specific drivers of the group's stability are more powerful

 These 'lion' people strongly believe in certain idealistic goals due to the excessive influence by the specific drivers of the stability of the group and they do not hesitate to resort to power to achieve those ideals
