 ISBN 0-938279-07-6 ISBN 978-0-938279-07-5 The word "baby" has a very wide meaning
 koi janm se lekar dhai teen varshon tak, koi paanch varsh tak or koi chah yaa saat varsh tak ke bachche ko shishu kahata he
 But the meaning of Shishu Shiksha is considered "education from two to eleven or twelve years"
 is paryaapt lambii avadhi ko praaia do bhaagon main baanta jaataa he
 Education of two to six years is called Shishu Shiksha, which is usually given in the nurseries
 chah varsh ke pashchaat gyaarah yaa baarah varsh kii shiksha ko balashiksha yaa praarambhik shiksha kehete hai
 Elementary education is compulsory in all progressive countries of the world
 at: kahin chah varsh ke pashchaat or kahin saat varsh se praarambhik vidyalayon main shiksha aarambh kii jaati he jo praaia: paanch varshon tak chalati he
 The children then enter secondary education
 shishu manushya kaa purvarup he
 All the powers and possibilities of man are embedded in the infant
 uske samuchit paalan poshan evam shikshadiksha par hi bhavi manushya kaa vikaas nirbhar rahata he
 Therefore, the foundation to complete the education of man should fall in infancy
 isi se aaj ke yug main shishushiksha ko sarvaadhik mahatv pradaan kiya jaataa he
 By the nineteenth century, the method of educating the infant was very harsh
 uske prati adhyaaapak kii sahanubhuti kaa abhaav tha
 Legislation of corporal punishment was prominent in education
 shishu kaa bhi koi pruthak vyaktitv he - uski apni aavashyaktaayen, swatantra ruchi evam aakankshaayen hai - isapar adhyaaapak kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa tha
 It was but natural for the teacher to be angry and give corporal punishment to the infant on the common offense

 In the middle of the nineteenth century a German scholar named Frobel created a revolution in pedagogy through the "balodyan" method; But due to many reasons, it was propagated at a slow pace, which by the end of the nineteenth century, this method spread to other countries of Europe and America

 According to the different interests and mental development of each infant, there was a system to teach him

 In most countries, two major methods of pedagogy are practiced - one is Balodyan, the other is Montessori
 balodyan paddati main bacchon ko kuch khilaunon yaa krida upkarnon tathaa shishu geeton dwaara samuhik shiksha di jaati he
 Children are attracted to education with great interest, and school becomes a center of attraction for them
 parantu shishumanovigyaan ke vikaas se pataa chalaa he ki prayek shishu duusare se bhinn hota he
 Therefore, his education should be done differently from others
 us apni sahaj shaktiyon evam sambhaavnaaon kaa vikaas karne ke liye avasar milanaa chahie
 Only by giving group education, many of his powers remain undeveloped
 at: balodyan kaa sthaan dhire dhire mantessori paddati le rahi he
 The basic basis of Mantesori method is the development or means of knowledge and freedom of the child
 is paddati ke dwaara teen se chah yaa saat varsh ke bacchon kaa anek prakaar ke shaikshik yantron aparats dwaara vastuon ke rup, rang, aakaar aadi kaa gyaan karaayaa jaataa he
 But usually the children themselves get complete knowledge
 aatmashikshan is paddati kaa mul mantra he
 The teacher is present as a viewer and communicates and directs the child's actions
 isse use "adhyapika" na kahkar "sanchalika" kehete hai
 In Mentesori schools, useful education of practical life along with sensory education is provided, such as dining, cleaning the room, arranging the room items, etc
 swatchta ke saath hi veshbhusha dhaaran karne ke dhang, jaise baalo main kanghee karnaa, kapadon main batan lagaana, feeta bandhna ityadi bhi sikhaye jate hai
 In these schools all necessary items like table, chair, post, etc
 are made lightly so that children can easily move them
 is prakaar unhen apane sabhi kaary swayan karne kii shiksha di jaati he
 In both these types of methods, the importance of the personality of the child is accepted and it is considered best to teach him with love, not by giving any kind of corporal punishment
 shiksha main dand yaa puraskaar ke bina vaataavaran se jo prerana milti he vahi shishu ke vikaas main sahaayak hoti he
 In Balodyan method, there is a law of gifts but not of prizes
 mantessori paddati main bhi puraskaar yaa pralobhan dekar shiksha kii ore aakrisht karne kaa koi vidhaan nahin he
 The principle of activism is valid in both methods
 bacchon main kriyasheeltaa evam sphurti kii adhikta hoti he jiskaa sanchaalan upyukt disha main hona chahie
 Therefore, in modern education, the child is kept busy with various activities and education is provided as a form of play so that it does not make the child feel burdened
 aadhunik shiksha kaa ek bahumanya siddhant he karke siikhnaa
 According to this theory, practical knowledge is taught in both the above mentioned methods
 shishu ke sharir main nirantar vardhaman shakti ev sphurti kaa upyog karne ke liye shaareerik vyaayaam tathaa khel-kud kii paryaapt vyavastha rakhi jaati he
 Adherence to the rules of sports provides education of discipline, as well as the practice of working and exchanging through cooperation increases
 shishushiksha main kahani, kavita tathaa sangeet ko bhi pramukh sthaan diya jaataa he
 Although Mrs Mantesori is against fairy tales and considers them unsuitable for children, in practice it is often seen that such stories not only entertain the children but also develop their imagination
 at: unke paathyakram main inkaa hona laabhadaayak siddh hota he
 Mrs
 Mantessori also acknowledges the importance of poetry and music for children
 at: unke vidyalayon main bacchon ko kavitaayen - visheshat: naadasaundaryaatmak, layayukt evam abhinaeya kavitaayen sikhaai jaati hai
 The songs that follow along with the songs of Prayan and dance are given priority

 Sriramchandraji first started this Sharadiya Navaratri Puja on the beach and then departed and conquered Lanka for the tenth day
 tab se asaty, adharm par satya, dharm kii jeet kaa parv dashahra manaaya jane laga

 Navratri is celebrated differently in different parts of India
 gujarat main is tyohaar ko bade paimaane se manaaya jaataa he
 Navratri celebrations in Gujarat are known as Dandiya and Garba
 yah puri raat bhar chalata he
 Dandiya's experience is extraordinary

 Among the main festivals of Bengalis in the state of West Bengal, Durga Puja has emerged in the most elaborate form in the Bengali calendar

 These two periods are considered sacred occasions for the worship of Goddess Durga
 tyohaar kii tithiyaan chandra calendar ke anusaar nirdhaarit hoti hai
 The concept of Navratri festival, maa-durga, is considered to be the most auspicious and unique period of devotion and worship of divine power
 yah puja vaidic yug se pehle, pragaitihaasik kaal se he
 Since the Vedic era of the sage, Gayatri Sadhana has been the main form of devotional practices during Navratri
 navaratri ke pehle teen din devi durga kii puja karne ke liye samarpit kiye gaye hai
 This worship is done for his energy and strength

 The woman who has reached the stage of maturity on the third day is worshiped
 devi durga ke vinaashkari pahalu sab buraai pravritiyon par vijay praapt karne ke patibaddhta ke pratik he
 When a person overcomes the evil tendencies of ego, anger, lust and other animal instincts, he experiences a void
 yah shunya aadhyatmik dhan se bhar jaataa he
 For the purpose, the person worships Goddess Lakshmi to attain all materialistic, spiritual wealth and prosperity
 navaratri ke chauthe, paanchaven or chathe din lakshmi- samruddhi or shanti kii devi, kii puja karne ke liye samarpit he
 Perhaps the person overcomes evil tendencies and wealth, but he is still deprived of true knowledge
 gyaan ek maanviya jivan jeene ke liye aavashyak he bhale hi vah satta or dhan ke saath samrudh he
 Therefore, Goddess Saraswati is worshiped on the fifth day of Navratri
 sabhi pustakon or anya sahitya samagriyon ko ek sthaan par ikattha kar diya jaataa hai or ek diya devi aahvaan or aashirwad lene ke liye, devtaa ke saamne jalaayaa jaataa he

 On the other hand, Ravana also started Chandi recitation with the desire of victory in the greed of immortality
 yah baat indra dev ne pawan dev ke madhyam se shriram ke paas pahunchaai or paraamarsh diya ki chandi paath yathasabhav purna hone diya jaae
 Here in the Havan material, a Neelkamal from the place of worship disappeared from the elusive power of Ravana and Ram's resolve began to appear broken
 bhay is baat kaa tha ki devi maan rusht na ho jaaen
 The arrangement of the rare Neelkamal was immediately impossible, then Lord Rama readily remembered that i am called 'kamalanayan Navakancha Lochan', so why not offer an eye to fulfill your resolve and take out an arrow from your shoulder like Lord Ram When the eyes were ready to be removed, the goddess appeared, holding her hand and said - Ram, i am happy and blessed Vijayashree
 vahiin ravan ke chandi paath main yajna kar rahe brahmanon kii seva main brahman balak kaa rup dhar kar hanumanji seva main jute gaye
 Seeing selfless service, the Brahmins asked Hanumanji to ask for the groom
 is par hanuman ne vinamratapurvak kaha- prabhu, aap prasann hai to jis mantra se yajna kar rahe hai, uskaa ek akshar mere kehane se badal dijie
 The Brahmins could not understand this mystery and said Aastu
 mantra main jayadevi


 bhurtiharini main 'ha' ke sthaan par 'k' uccharit karen, yahi meri ichha he
 Bhurtiharini, which means the suffering of beings and 'karini', means to torment creatures, causing the Goddess to be angry and to destroy Ravana
 hanumanji maharaj ne shloke main 'ha' kii jagah 'k' karwaakar ravan ke yajna kii disha hi badal di
 According to another legend associated with this festival, Goddess Durga killed a buffalo-like demon, Mahishasura
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar mahisasur ke ekagra dhyaan se baadhya hokar devataaon ne use ajay hone kaa vardaan de diya
 After granting him a boon, the gods worried that he would now misuse his power
 or pratyaashit pratifal swaroop mahisasur ne narak kaa vistaar swarg ke dwaar tak kar diya or uske is krity ko dekh devtaa vismay kii sthiti main aa gaye
 Mahishasura has taken away all the rights of Surya, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Moon, Yama, Varuna and other deities and himself became the master of heaven
 devataaon ko mahisasur ke prakope se prithvi par vicharan karnaa pad rahaa he
 Then, angry with this daring of Mahishasura, the gods created Goddess Durga
 aisa mana jaataa he ki devi durga ke nirmaan main saare devataaon kaa ek samaan bal lagaaya gaya tha
 To destroy Mahishasura, all the gods gave their weapons to the goddess Durga and it is said that with the combined effort of these gods, the goddess Durga became more powerful
 in nau din devi-mahisasur sangram hua or antatah mahisasur-vadh kar mahisasur mardini kahalaayin
 The means for the commencement of the work which are postponed in Chaumasay are collected from this day itself

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 Any action that increases the number of responses is called reinforcement

 Reinforcement plays a pivotal role in active contracting
 yah nakaaratmak yaa sakaaratmak ho saktaa he
 In the use of Skinner, the mouse responds to repeated liver pressures and receives food
 ise sakaaratmak punarbalan kehete hai
 Thus a positive reinforcement or reward is the tendency that forces the learning of the effect of that specific behavior

 ‘nakaaratmak’ shabd punarbalan kii prakruti ko bataata he 
 This is reinforcing because it increases the number of responses
 is vidhi ko ‘palaayan’ adhigam kaha gaya kyonki chuha agar liver ko dabaata he to aghat se batch saktaa he
 The second type of contraction that occurs as a result of negative reinforcement is called avoidance learning in which the rat can survive the stroke by pressing the lever
 palaayan yaa bachaav dwaara seekhney main nakaaratmak punarbalan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or praani palaayan dwaara isse batch jaataa he
 How can responses be reinforced? This can occur with the use of continuous reinforcement or partial reinforcement

 For example, the number of times a mouse presses the lever, the same amount of food is presented in the plate

 Constant reinforcement helps in establishing or strengthening new behaviors

 kutil lipi ko 'uttaralichhavi lipi' bhi kehete hai
 This script originated from India
 is lipi ko bharat main 'vikatakshar' bhi kehete hai
 Archaeologists have called this script as 'siddhamatruka script'
 yah lipi nepal main anshuvarma ke shasankaal ke baad hi prachlan main ai
 Nevertheless, the influence of the Kutila script can be seen in the letters of the inscriptions of Anshuvarma

 Similarly, this script was in vogue in Nepal for 500 years from the late seventh century to the twelfth century

 Saryuparin Brahmin or Saravariya Brahmin or Saryupari Brahmin are said to be Brahmins inhabiting the eastern side of the Sarayu River

 These include Saraswati, Indus and Sarayu river
 kai logo kaa maananaa he ki sarauparin brahman unhi mul kanykubj brahmanon kaa dal he jinhone bhartiya sabhyataa kii niv purvi uttar pradesh or uttari bihar main rakhi
 This is the pure Aryavanshi Shatkarma Vedapathi Adikalika group, which has been the founder of Brahmin religion since ancient times
 sarauparin brahman kii utpatti evam isaki vanshavali ko lekar aath pandito ne kitabe likhi hai parantu sabhi ne jo tark die, unamem virodhabhash dikhataa hai
 For example, in 1914, Pandit Bholaram Agnihotri of Prayag wrote the story about the origin of Saryuparin Brahmin in his book "saryuparine Brahmin Dwijottapatti:" According to it - when 16 Brahmins were called from Kanyakubj region for the Ashwamedha Yajna of Shri Ramchandra ji
 After he was done, when he started going back to his state, Shri Ram requested him to go and settle his bow
 He fired an arrow from 25 miles away at the confluence of the Saryu and Ghaghra rivers and he gave the land of twenty-five yojans to the Brahmins
 shar or waar kiye jane ke kaaran is bhoomi kshetra ko sharvaar yaa sarvar kaha jane laga or vahaan ke rahane vaale bramhan sarwariyaa kahalaane lage
 Now, if we look at this story, it is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana that this yagna was performed on the banks of the river Gomti
 jisame vashishtha, vamdev or jabali aadi rishiyon ne bhaag liya tha
 But Brahmins of Vamdev and Jabali are not found in Saryuparin Brahmins
 at: ise bhrampurna hi mana jaayegaa kii sarauparin bramhanon ke purvaj is yajna main sammalit the
 Apart from this, the War word used in it is not mentioned in any Sanskrit texts
 angrej itihaaskaar sar es aliot ke apane ek lekh ke anusaar kannauj ke rahane vaale kanyakubj kii hi paanch shakhao main se ek sarayu ke aas paas fail gaye
 Apart from this, according to other English writers Sir John Wombs, W
 Crook, Kanya and Kubja were two brothers whose children went ahead and called Kanyakubj
 or inhi kii ek shakha raja aj ke samay sarayu nadi kinare aa kar bas gaye or sarwariyaa bramhaan kahalaane lage
 Many differences can also be seen in this story
 jaise kii vaayu puraana ke bhuwan vinyas prasang main bramhaji ke janm se lekar bramhan tak ke janm tak kii katha hai
 But in the time of King Aja, there is no reference to Brahmins coming there or settling in their branches
 puraanon se pataa chalata hai ki devgan himalay parvat ke aas-paas rahaa karte the tathaa usee ke nikat hi mahanatam rishiyon ke ashram hua karte the
 Since the Himalayan mountain range is considered very sacred in the Puranas, it seems possible for the sages to stay there
 yadi puranic sandarbho kii ore dekh jaae to jab devraj indra kii aatithy sweekaar kar apane rajdhani ko lautate hue raja dushyant ne rishiyon ke param kshetra hemkut parvat kii ore dekha tha jiskaa varnan padam puraana main aayaa hai : Southern India North of the year kuladev mahabhag tasya seemaa himalayah
 
 tatah kimpurein hemkutadadh: sthitam
 Hari yaar tato jayayan nivadhobadhiruchyte 
 Similarly, in a passage in the Baraha Purana, Maharishi Pulastya, in reference to the journey from Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, states that: tato gachchhet rajendra devikan lok vishrutam
 Maternity vipranam shriyate bharatsarbha
 
 Devikayastte Veeranagaran name Vaipuram
 samridadhyatirmyanch pulsatyen niveshitam
 
 arthath- he rajendra lok vishrut devika nadi ko janaa chahie jaha bramhanon ki utpatti suni jaati he
 There is a beautiful Puri named Veeranagar on the banks of the river Devika which is rich and beautiful
 ek anya puraana ke sandarbh se nishchit hota hai ki devika nadi ke kinare hemkut naamak kimpurush kshetra main rishi-muni rahaa karte the
 "devikaian Sarayavachan Bhavedavikasarvau" arthath- devika or sarayu kshetra ke rahane vaale aavik or sarav kahe jate hai
 Estimates are that the combination of sarva and avar would have formed sarvaar, and then over time the sarvaar would have become pronounced
 isi sarvar kshetra ke rahane vaale sarwariyaa kahe jane lage honge
 In this regard, the following references are found in the Matsya Purana: ayodhyaayaan dakshine yasyah sarayuttah punah
 Sarvavar Deshoyam and Gaud: Dispersed
 
 That is, on the banks of river Saryu in the south of Ayodhya, there is a country of sarvars, similarly Gonda country should also be considered
 sarayu nadi kailash parvat se nikal kar vihaar pradesh main chhapra nagar ke sameep narayani nadi main mil jaati hai
 The river Devika originates in Gandaki along the Brahmaputra, originating from the Himalayas, 60 miles from Gorakhpur
 gandki nadi nepal kii tarai se nikal kar sarvar kshetra hota hua sarayu nadi main samahit hota hai
 Saryu, Ghaghra and Devika, these three rivers flow together in one place
 mahabharat main iskaa ullekh hai ki sarayu, ghaghara or devika nadi himalay se nikalati hai, tino nadiyon kaa sangam pahaad main hi ho gaya tha
 That is why Sarayu is called somewhere Ghaghra and Kahi Devika
 puraanon ke anusaar yahi bramh kshetra hai, jahaan par bramhanon kii utpatti hui thi yathasamay bramh desh se jo bramhan anya desh main gaye, ve us desh ke naam se abhihit hue
 Those who went to the southern region of the Vindhyas were distinguished as Maharashtri, Dravid, Karnataka and Gurjara Brahmins
 or jo vindhyas ke uttar deshon main based, ve saraswat, kanyakubj, gond, utkal, maithil bramhan ke rup main pratishthit hue
 In this way, when Dasavidhi Brahmins became distinguished, they became popular names for the identification of Brahmins resident of Brahmadesh
 vahi aage chal kar sarvary, sarwariyaa, sarauparin aadi kahe jane lage
 Therefore, those who call Saryuparin Brahmins only a branch of Kanyakubja, it is just an illusion
 smritiyon main pankti paavan bramhanon kaa ullekh miltaa hai
 Row Holy Brahmins are only in Saruparino
 jo aaj bhi pantiha yaa panktipaavan ke rup main viddman hai
 Although the number of sages in India has been many, but only 49 sages have gotras
 rishiyon ke shishy pravarkaar maane jate the tathaa us rishiyon ke ashram main jo veda, shakha aadi padhai jaati thi vahi veda, upved shakha sutara us gotra kii maani jane lagi, jo vartmaan tak chalati aa rahi hai
 There is a mythological reference behind what are currently called 3, 13, 16 houses in Saryuparin Brahmins according to which the process of recitation of Shukla Yajurveda started in the ashram of sage Garga to protect the Vedas and reach it to the next generation
 atah rishi garg ko pratham gotrakaar mana jaataa hai
 After sage Garga, Gautama again started the tradition of studying Yajurveda and Samaveda in the ashram of the sage Shaindilya
 or phir yahi teen ashram aage chal kar pratham koti ke garg, gautam or shandilya ghar maane jane lage
 After that, the reading of other branches of Vedos started in the ashrams of 13 other sages
 jo aaj 13 ghar maane jate hai
 Since there is no order of sages like these, they are considered in the same category
 chuki in rishiyon ke ashramon main atharvaveda evam dhanurveda aadi bhi padhaayaa jaataa tha jise us samay shreyaskar nahin mana jaataa tha
 Therefore, Garg, Gautama and Shandilya, who were imparting spiritual education, could not fall under the category of sages
 garg Thirteen boys of Garg Rishi are said to be called Garg Gotriya, Pancha Pravariya, Shukla, Bansaj, who were divided in thirteen villages
 The names of the villages are as follows
 oonchhariya pichora bhendi bakruaan akoliyaan bharwaliyaan kanail modhiphekaraa malhiyan mahason mahuliyaar buddhahat mamkhor isame chaar gaanv kaa naam aata he lakhanura, munjiyad, bhaandi, or nauvagaanv| ye saare gaanv lagbhagagorakhpur, devaria or basti main aaj bhi paae jate hai| Prefix upgarg ke chha: gaanv jo garg rishi ke anukaraniya the kuch is prakaar se hai| Barwan Chandan Pichhokan Kadkar Dada Dapar yahi mulat: gaanv he jahaan se shukla bansh kaa udai mana jaataa he yaheen se log anyatra bhi jaakar shukla bansh kaa utthan kar rahen hai yen sabhi sarauparin brahman hai| Gautam gautam rishi ke chha: putr bataaye jaate hai jo in chha: gaanvon ke washi the| Chanchai Madhubani Champa Champaran Vidra Bhatiyari inhi chha: gaanvon se gautam gotreey, triprvariya mishra vansh kaa udai hua he, yaheen se anyatra bhi palaayan hua he ye sabhi sarauparin brahman hai| Deputy Gautam up gautam yani gautam ke anukaarak chha: gaanv is prakaar se hai| kalidiha multi-dimensional Dahi Bhabans Patnade Kapisa in gaanvon se up gautam kii utpatti maani jati he| Gargya gotra) gargy rishi ke ek hi putr the jo ucch koti ke dube vanshaj he jo koreri gaanv me vibhakt ho gaye jinhe karvariyaa kii oopaadhi mili

 Their gotra is Shri Mukha Shandilya - Tri-lover, Shri Mukha Shandilya has the practice of Gharanas, which includes Ram Gharana, Krishna Gharana, Nath Gharana, Mani Gharana, all four of them rise from sohgaura-gorakhpur where even today these four exist Is maintained
 up shandilya Their six villages are said to be as follows
 sheeshvan chaurihan chanrvata jojia dhakaraa qajaravata ! Bhargava gotra bhargav rishi ke chaar putr bataaye jate hai jisamen chaar gaanvon kaa ullekh miltaa he jo is prakaar he| Singhanjodi echelon Chetan Madanpur bharadwaj gotra Four sons of Rishi Bharadwaj are left, whose origin is told from these four villages
 badgaiyaan saraar parahoona garyapar Kanchaniya and Lathiyari are said to be Dubey Gharana in these two villages which are actually Gautam Mishra but their fathers were Uthtamani and Shankhamani Gautam Mishra respectively but the resident king Bodhamal dug a pokhara in which the stove could not run, both the brothers at the king's behest Together, he drove the log in which one caught the part with the log, then the others caught the stick part, in which Kanchaniya and Lathiyari got the name, Dubey Ga Mr
 begin to be called these people Dube | saraar ke dube ke vahaan panti kaa prachlan rahaa he atev inako teen ke samakaksh mana jaataa he| Bhardwaj gotra is gotra ke upaadhyaay vansh ke teen gaanv he

 The girls have been married by the ancestors leaving their villages in the Garga, Gautam, and Shandilya gotras
 There has been the same sequence of Pandey of Itar and Dubey of Srar, the marriage of girls has been exchanged in these five, there have been marriages of boys in other gotras
 Now-a-days this exception has started being proved
 All these villages, which have been mentioned, can be found in Vengorakhpur, Deoria, Basti district especially, or there may also be nearby districts, these people all fall under the category of Saryu Parin, elite Brahmin

 Childhood is the age period from birth to adolescence
 vikasaatmak manovigyaan main, bachapan ko shaishvavastha, praarambhik bachapan, madhya bachapan, tathaa kishoravastha ke vikasaatmak charnon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The term childhood is nonspecific can be used for various stages of age in human development
 vikasaatmak rup se, yah bachapan or vayaskta ke bich kii avadhi ko darshata he
 In general terms, childhood is considered to have originated from birth
 avadharana ke rup main kuch log bachapan ko khel or maasoomiyat se jod kar dekhte hai, jo kishoravastha main samaapt hota he
 In many countries, there is an adult age when childhood officially ends and the person legally becomes an adult
 yah umr 13 se 21 ke bich kahin bhi ho sakati he or 18 sabase aam he
 Early childhood comes after infancy and begins with the child stuttering as the child begins to speak and move freely
 jahaan shaishvavastha teen saal kii umr main samaapt hoti he jab baccha buniyadi zaruuraton ke liye apane mata-pita par kam nirbhar rahane lagata he, praarambhik bachapan saat se aath saal kii umr tak chalata he
 According to the National Organization for the Education of Young Children, the period of early childhood is from birth to age eight
 madhya bachapan lagbhag saat yaa aath kii umr se shuru hota he, jo anumaanatah praathmik skool kii umr he or lagbhag yauvan kaal par samaapt hota he, jo kishoravastha kii shuruyaat he
 Adolescence, or the last stage of childhood, begins with puberty
 kishoravastha kaa ant or vayaskta kii shuruuaat main deshvaar tathaa kriyaavaar bhinnata he or ek hi desh-rajya yaa samskruti ke bheetar alag-alag umr hoti he jiske vyakti ko itnaa paripakv mana jaataa he ki samaaj dwaara kinhin kaaryon ko saupa ja sake
 It is argued that childhood is not a natural phenomenon but a creation of society

 This topic was further elaborated by Cunningham in his book Invention of Childhood, which looks at historical aspects of childhood from the medieval period, which he refers to as the period after the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s after World War One

 Based on the idea of john Locke and other 17th century liberal thinkers, Russo called childhood a short sanctuary period before encountering the dangers and hardships of adulthood
 Russo pleaded, "why rob these innocent people of happiness that passes so quickly"
 "why fill up the bitterness in the early days of early childhood, the days that will never return for them nor for you?" victoria kaal ko bachapan kii aadhunik sanstha ke strot ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Ironically, the industrial revolution of this period had exacerbated child labor, but due to the campaigns of Christian evangelist and author Charles Dickens and others, child labor continued to decrease and was abolished by the Factories Act of 1802–1878

 In the contemporary era, Joe L
 Cinchelo and Shirley R
 Steinberg produced a critical theory on childhood and early childhood education, which he named Kinderculture
 kinchelo or steenberg ne bachapan ke adhyayan ke liye kai anusandhan or saidhantik vimarshon kaa upyog vibhinn drushtikonon - itihaas lekhan, nrivanshavigyaan, sangyanatmak anusandhan, media adhyayan, saanskrithik adhyayan, raajnneetik aarthik vishleshan, hermeneutics, sanketikta, saamagree vishleshan aadi ke aadhaar par kiya
 On the basis of this multilateral investigation, Kincheloe and Steinberg firmly stated that the modern period has entered a new era of childhood
 is naatakeey saanskrithik parivartan ke sakshya sarvyaapee he, lekin 20veen sadi ke ant or 21veen sadi kii shuruyaat main kai vyaktiyon ne ise abhi tak dekha nahin he
 When Kincheloe and Steinberg wrote the first edition of Kinderculture: The Corporate Culture of Childhood in 1997, many people who made a living by studying, teaching or caring for children related to the changes in childhood dispositions they face daily
 Were not aware kinderculture se pehle manovigyaan, shiksha or kuch kam maatra main samajashaastra or saanskrithik adhyayan ke kshetron ke kuch paryvekshakon dwaara adhyayan kiya gaya tha ki gyaan visphot ne, jo hamaare samakaleen yug kii visheshta he, bachapan kii paramparaagat dharanaon ko kamazor kiya he or bachapan kii shiksha ke kshetra ko parivartit kiya he
 Those who have shaped, directed, and employed contemporary information technology have played an exaggerated role in childhood reintegration
 kinchelo or steenberg kaa maananaa he ki beshak, soochna praudyogiki ne akele hi bachapan ke ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat nahin kiya he
 Of course, many social, cultural, political and economic factors have driven such changes
 kinderculture kaa mukhya prayojan, saamaajik, saanskrithik, raajnneetik or aarthik rup se bachapan kii badalati aitihaasik sthiti ko sthapit karnaa tathaa vividh media dwaara sthapana main sahaayak un tareekon ko vishesh rup se jaanchana he jise kinchelo tathaa steenberg "nayaa bachapan" kehete hai
 Kinderculture understands that childhood is an ever-changing social and historical artifact - not just an organic entity
 Because many psychologists have argued that childhood is a natural stage of growing up to become an adult, Kincheloe and Steinberg, coming from an academic context, saw kinderculture as a corrective of "psychoanalysis" of childhood
 bachapan ke bhugol main sammilit hai ki kis prakaar samaaj bachapan ke vichaar ko grahan karata he or anek roopon main vayaskon kaa aacharan bacchon ke jivan ko prabhavit karata he
 This includes the environmental perspective surrounding children and the implications thereof
 kuch vishyon main yah bacchon ke bhugol ke samaan he jo us samay evam sthaan kaa pareekshan karata he jisamen bachche jivan vyateet karte hai
 The concept of childhood seems to evolve and change according to changes in lifestyles and changes in adult expectations
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki bacchon ko koi chintaa nahin honi chahie or unhen kaam karne kii zarurat nahin honi chahie; jivan kushhaal or pareshaaniyon se mukt rahanaa chahie
 Childhood is usually a mixture of happiness, wonder, worry and resilience
 aam taur par yah sansar main vayaskon ke hastkshep ke bina, abhibhavakon se alag rahakar khilne, seekhney, mail-milaap, khoj karne kaa samay he
 It is time to learn about responsibilities while remaining separate from adult responsibilities
 bachapan ko aksar bahari taur par maasoomiyat ke kaal ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jise saamanytah sakaaratmak sandarbh main liya jaataa he, jo vishwa ke sakaaratmakak drushtikon kii ore sanket karata he, visheshkar jahaan gyaan kaa abhaav galatiyon se prasphutit hota he, jabaki mahanatam gyaan galtiyaan karne se praapt hota he
 "loss of innocence" is a general concept and is often seen as an integral part of age growth
 ise aam taur par ek anubhav yaa bachche ke jivan ke ek aise kaal ke rup main mana jaataa he jab buraai, pidaa yaa apane chaaron ore kii duniya ke bare main unki jaagrukta vistrut hoti he
 This theme is featured in the novels To Kill a Mocking Bird and Lord of the Flies

 The following game provides opportunities for children to work in groups, share, compromise, resolve disputes and learn self-advocacy skills
 lekin jab khel vayaskon dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he, bachche vayaskon ke niyamon or chintaaon ko maun rup se sweekaar kar lete hai or khel dwaara pradutt kuch laabh visheshkar rachanaatmakataa, netritv or samuhik kaushal vikaas ke avasar kho dete hai
 The game is considered so important for the better development of children that it has been recognized as a right of every child in the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights

 The Act was originally passed in August 1935 and was called the longest Act of Parliament enacted at that time
 isaki lambaai kii vajah se, pratikriya swaroop bharat sarkaar dwaara adhinium 1935 ko ko do alag-alag adhiniyamon main vibhajit kiya gaya: In literature on Indian political and constitutional history, the reference is generally taken to be a shortened form of the Government of India 1935 Act, rather than being enacted originally as a text of the Act
 adhinium ke sabase mahatvapurn pahalu the: However, the degree of autonomy the introduction of the provincial level was subject to significant limitations: the provincial governor retained significant reserve powers and the British authorities also retained the authority to suspend a responsible government
 adhinium ke kuch hisson kii maang bharat sangh ko sthapit karnaa tha lekin rajasi rajyon ke shaskaon ke virodh ke kaaran kabhi sanchaalan main nahin aayaa
 The remaining part of the Act came into force in 1937 when the first elections were held under the Act
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh ke baad se bhartiya logon ne apane desh kii sarkaar main lagaataar badi bhoomika kii maang kii
 The contribution of Indians to the British war effort during World War i meant that the more conservative elements of the British political establishment felt the need for constitutional change and the resulting 1919 Act of the Government of India
 The act introduced a neo system of government known as the provincial "dyarchy", that is, the government of some regions was placed in the hands of ministers responsible for the provincial legislature while others were appointed by the British-appointed provincial governor
 Were held in the hands of the officials responsible for
 jabaki adhinium, bharatiyon dwaara sarkaar main ek badi bhoomika nibhaane kii maang kaa ek pratibimb tha, saath hi bharat kii vyavastha main us bhoomika kaa kya matlab ho saktaa he iske bare main british bhay kaa ek pratibimb tha
 Experiments with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory
 bhartiya netaaon ke liye ek vishesh rup se niraashaa yah hi ki un kshetron main jahaan keval nammaatr kaa niyantran unhone praapt kiya tha, lekin "mukhya adhikaar" british naukarshahi ke haathon main hi tha
 It was intended to review India's constitutional arrangements and those princely states that were ready to accept it
 haalanki, samjhaute ko rokane ke liye congress or muslim pratinidhiyon ke bich vibhaajan karnaa mukhya kaarak sabit hua chunki vyavastha main sangh ke kaam karne kii mahatvapurn jaankaree thi
 Against the system, the new Conservative-dominated national government in London decided to come forward with the drafting of its own proposal
 lord linlithgo kii adhyakshata main ek sanyukt sansadeey chayan samiti ne kaaphi had tak white paper kii samiksha kii
 On the basis of this white paper, the Government of India bill was created
 cameti str or baad main kattarta ko shant kiya gaya, "suraksha" ko majboot kiya gaya or kendriya vidhansabha ke liye apratyaksh chunaav kaa punah aayojan kiya gaya
 The bill was duly passed into law in August 1935
 is prakriya kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, haalanki bhartiya maangon ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke 1935 kii adhinium ko thodaa or aage janaa chahie tha, iskaa masauda saamagree main bill kaa bistaar or bhartiya bhagidaari kii kami donon kaa arth tha ki bharat main sarvshereshth nirutsaah pratikriya ke saath adhinium kaa hona jabaki britain main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke liye yah kattarpanthi sabit hui
 Although it became unusual for the Acts of the British Parliament to include the Preamble, the lack of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasted with the Act of 1919, which led to the purpose of that Act relating to it for Indian political development
 Established a comprehensive philosophy
 20 agast 1917 ko house of comons ke liye bharat mantri edwin montagu ke vaktavy par aadhaarit 1919 ke adhinium kii prastaavna uddhrut he, jo vaada karti he: 


 is a gradual development of self-governing institution with a philosophy for the progressive presentation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire
 canada or australia jaise maujuuda dominian ke saath bhartiya maangon main ab british bharat main sanvaidhanik samta ko praapt karnaa tha jiskaa arth tha ki british rashtramandal main sampoorn swaittata
 An important element in the British political circle doubted that Indians were able to run their country on this basis and with sufficient "security", perhaps, the Dominion status as an objective after a long period of gradual constitutional development saw
 unke bich yah tanaav or bhartiya or british ke bheetar drushti ke parinamswaroop 1935 adhinium ke besanga samjhaute ko paaya gaya jisamen isaki koi apni prastaavna nahin thi, lekin 1919 adhinium kii prastaavna ko isaki jagah rakhaa gaya phir bhi us adhinium ke avshesh ko nirast kiya
 It was generally seen in India as more mixed messages from the British, suggesting a defiant attitude on its part and the barest of "minimum essentials" towards satisfying Indian desires
 sabase aadhunik samvidhanon ke vipareet, lekin us samay ke rashtramandal sanvaidhanik kanoon ke saath saamaanya, adhinium ne "adhikaar ke bill" ko nae pranali ke bheetar shaamil nahin kiya jisaki sthapana kaa uddeshy tha
 However, in the proposed case of the Union of India there were some complications involving a set of rights, as the new entity included nominal sovereign princely states
 haalanki kuch logon dwaara ek alag drushtikon ko mana gaya or nehru report main masauda ruparekha samvidhan main bill ke adhikaar ko shaamil kiya gaya
 In 1947, a relatively few amendments to the Act made the Interim Implementation Constitution of India and Pakistan
 adhinium keval atyant vistrut hi nahin tha, lekin yah 'suraksha maanak' ke saath ghira tha, british jimmedaariyon or hiton ko banaae rakhane ke liye jab bhi isaki aavashyaktaa hoti hastkshep karne ke liye british sarkaar ko sakasham banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 To meet this goal, the Indian government's institutions are gradually increasing in the face of Indianisation, the decision to use the Act and the actual administration of the security measures in the hands of the British appointed Viceroy and the Provincial Governors who are the Secretary of State for India Was under control
 'vishaal shaktiyon or jimmedaariyon jise governor general apane vivek yaa apane vyaktigat nirnay ke anusaar anushaasan karnaa chahie, yah spasht he ki uske ko superman kii tarah ho jane kii ummid hoti he
 He must be endowed with an infinite capacity for humility, courage and hard work
 "we have inserted many safeguards in this bill" Sir Robert Horn said 


 "but all those safeguards are about the same person i think and she is Viceroy
 vah puri vyavastha kii lynch-pin he
 


 if the Viceroy fails, nothing can save your installed system
 " yah bhaashan drudh torij ke drushtakon ko pratibimbit karti he jo ek din lebar government dwaara viceroy kii niyukti hone kii sambhaavna dwaara bhaybheet tha
 a proper reading of the Act shows that the British Government has prepared it for itself, whenever they feel they could take full control of it at any time with the legal tools
 haalanki, bina kisi sateek kaaran ke aisa karnaa bharat ke samooh ke saath unki vishwasaneeyata samaapt ho jaati jinka uddeshy adhinium ko praapt karnaa tha
 Some odd ideas: "sangheey sarkaar main 


 jimmedaar sarkaar kii ek jhalak prastut kiya he
 But there is a lack of reality, as the case lacks the necessary powers in defense and foreign affairs, the Governor General is necessarily given a threshold for ministerial activity and the measure of representation of Indian states is negative and even That there is no possibility of the introduction of democratic control
 ek atyant vishisht sarkaar ke nirmaan ke vikaas ko dekhne ke liye yah atyant ruchi kii vishay hogi; nishchit rup se, agar yah safaltaapurvak sanchalit hota he, sabase adhik credit bhartiya netaaon kii raajnneetik kshamta ko jayega, jinhone aupniveshik rajaneta kii tulana main adhik gambhir kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kiya he jinhone swayan-sarkaar kii pranali ko viksit kiya tha jo ki ab dominian str main paraakaashtha par he
 " lord lothian ne ek pantalis minute ke lambi baatcheet main is bill ke bare main apane vichaar rakhe hai: "I agree with the surrendered Kattaro
 Those who are not used to any constitution cannot realize what great powers they have to use
 yadi aap is samvidhan ko dekhenge to aisa lagegaa ki sabhi shaktiyaan governor general or rajyapal main nihit he
 But here the whole power is not vested in the king? Everything is done in the name of the king, but does the king ever interfere in it? Once power falls into the hands of the legislature, the governor or the governor general never intervene
 


 civil seva madad karti he
 You will also feel it
 Once a policy is set, they will take it forward with loyalty and honesty


 ham isaki madad nahin kar sakate hai
 We had to fight with the cutters here
 aapako ye kabhi ehsaas nahin hoga ki shri baldwin or sar samuel hore dwaara kitna mahaan saahas ko dikhaaya gaya he

 The impropriety of this arrangement is evident when the status of British capital in an Indian modern region is given greater prominence and total dominance, the impropriety is maintained through the commercial system, the UK in both India's international and coastal shipping traffic Removal of shipping interests and Indian capital in the UK without value and Indians in shipping within the UK Sector is the non-existence

 In the United Kingdom the two departments are subject to analogy control while in India one is responsible for the federal legislature and the other for the Imperial Parliament
 " From the moment of the Montagu statement of 1917, it was important to remain in the stage of the reform process if the British were to organize a strategic initiative
 haalanki, british raajnneetik cirkil main samrajyavaadee bhaavana or yatharthwaad kii kami ne ise asambhav bana diya
 Thus the involuntary conditional concessions of power in the Acts of 1919 and 1935 caused more dissatisfaction and failed to win the rule of influential groups in India which were desperately needed
 1919 main 1935 ke adhinium, yaa simon kamishan yojana kaaphi safal hui thi
 There is evidence that Montagu is supported in a similar way but his cabinet colleagues did not consider it
 1935 tak ek samvidhan bharat ke dominian ko sthapit kiya, british bhartiya praanton jisamen bharat main sweekaarya gaya ho saktaa he haalanki yah british sansad ko paarit nahin karegaa
 'at that time the balance of power in the conservative party was considered, the enactment passed in 1935 was unthinkable compared to passing the bill
 ' The provincial part of the Act which was automatically enacted originally followed the agreement of the Simon Commission

 1939 main congress prantiy mantralayon ke istife ke baad rajyapal yuddh tak purv-congress vaale praanton main sidhe shashan kiya tha
 It was generally accepted that the provincial part of the Act conferred a great deal of powers upon the provincial leaders as long as the British officers and Indian leaders acted under the rules
 However, intervention by the British governor intensified the paternal threat was done

 However, elements in the Liberals and the Congress were also ready to let it go with a dullness: "linlithgo ne sapru se poocha ki kya usne sochaa ki adhinium 1935 kii is yojana main ek santoshjanak vikalp tha
 Sapru said that they should implement the Act fast and the federal plan is embedded in it
 yah koi adarsh nahin tha, lekin is str par yah ekmaatr he
 


 a few days later Sapru came to Birla to meet the Viceroy

 Birla said that Gandhi was not much concerned about this through reservation for the Center for Defense and Foreign Affairs but was looking at how to choose the representatives of the states

 In September 1939, Linlithgow announced in general that India had gone to war with Germany
 haalanki linlithgo kaa vyavhaar sanvaidhanik rup se sahi tha saath hi bhartiya vichaaron ke liye yah kaaphi aakraamak tha
 This led to the slight resignation of the provincial ministries of the Congress which weakened Indian unity
