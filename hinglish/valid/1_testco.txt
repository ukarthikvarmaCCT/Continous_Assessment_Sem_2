 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mantriyon ke saath der raat tak chali baithak main kaha ki wo apana kaam karen vipaksh kii baton par gaur na karen
 According to the strategy, the ministers of the NDA government will go all over the country from January and tell the people about the ways of opposition to stop the functioning of the parliament due to which many bills are stuck
 ve logon ko bataaenge ki sarkaar garibon ke liye kya kya kaam kar rahi he or kya uplabdhiyaan hasil kar rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the ministers in his council meeting at his residence that he should be optimistic about what the government is doing and not be affected by the attacks of the opposition which is running a campaign based on lies
 kareeb dedh ghante tak chali baithak main pradhanmantri ne apane cabinetsahyogiyonse sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke bare main sandesh logon tak pahunchane or unase behatar sampark saadhane kii chunauti swikaarne ko kaha
 The detailed plan to be reviewed from time to time will be prepared later but the ministers have been asked to start the tour in parliamentary constituencies from the second week of January and spend at least 30 minutes in the areas earmarked for them
 pradhanmantri ne mantriyon se unke vibhaagon ke kaamkaaj kii samay-samay par samiksha karne ko kaha or kaamkaaj kaa pradarshan badhaane evam sarkaar kii chhavi sudhaane ke liye naye naye vichaaron ko laane kii jarurat par jor diya
 Participation should be increased Mododi's opinion was that people's participation should be increased in the preparation of the budget for the Central Government's schemes and it should not be that there is a situation of exaggeration on spending of money on the verge of the end of the financial year
 yah bhi nirnay liya gaya ki prayek mantri do sansadeey kshetron kaa daura karenge or logon ko bataaenge ki 2014 main satta main aane ke baad se sarkaar ne aam aadmi ke hit main kya faisle liye hai
 Focusing on telling the truth, according to sources, the Prime Minister wants the achievements of the government to be communicated to the people in as simple a language as possible
 baithak main aam raay thi ki 23 disambar ko sheetakaaleen satr samaapt hone vaala he or ab samay aa gaya he ki sarkaar sansad ke baahar vipaksh ke bare main logon ko sachai bataane par dhyaan kendrit kare
 This opinion has come amid indications that the government will not be able to pass the GST Bill in the Winter Session where Congress is disrupting the functioning of Parliament on National Herald matters and other issues
 sutron ke anusaar pradhanmantri ne mantriyon se kaha ki rajg sarkaar ne desh ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya he isliye unhen aatmavishvaas banaaye rakhana chahie
 The Prime Minister also asked ministers to work for the poor and take care of them through schemes
 samajha jaataa he ki modi ne kaha, ‘sarkaar ko garibon ke liye kaam karnaa hoga
 They will stand by you
 sarkaar ko is tarah se dekha jaae ki vah garibon kaa khyaal rakhane vaali he
 'all NDA ministers, including leaders of coalition partners such as Ram Vilas Paswan of LJP and Upendra Kushwaha of RLSP, were present at the meeting
 rajnath singh, venkaiya naidu or manohar parrikar jaise varisht bhaajapai mantriyon ne bhi baithak main shirkat kii
 However, Arun Jaitley was not present in the meeting, which has been accused by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for alleged corruption in DDCA
 modi ne mantriyon se party kaaryakartaaon se sampark main rahane ko or har saptahanth main unase milane ko kaha
 In the context of the North East, a priority area for the Modi government, the Prime Minister asked the ministers to visit these states continuously and bring suggestions for the development of the region

 loksabhaa main buudhvaar ko rafel ladaaku vimaan saude par bahes ke dauraan kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko sade aircraft or hathiyaaron se las vimaan kaa fark nahin pataa
 In retaliation for this statement of Arun Jaitley, Rahul Gandhi released the Government of India's Request for Proposal (RFP) of UPA in 2007 on the basis of which the Rafale fighter aircraft from France was selected for the Indian Air Force
 loksabhaa main hangaamedaar bahes ke baad congress mukhyalay main press conference ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne agast 2007 ko jari bharat sarkaar kaa request for prapojal (RFP) padhakar sunaaya, jiske aadhaar par yah sauda hua
 Rahul Gandhi said that all the weapons were mentioned in the condition of RFP, which had full details of laser sensor, rocket, radar and other weapons and this was also the basis of this deal
 bataa den ki kisi bhi saude se pehle sarkaar kii taraf se RFP jari kiya jaataa he, jisaki shart puri karne ke baad hi koi company saude ke liye biding kar sakati he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi accused Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of lying, saying that he had said that i do not know the difference between Fully Loaded Aircraft and Plane Aircraft
 rahul ne jetali ke bhaashan ke kuch ansh bhi dikhaate hue yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki jis rafel vimaan ke daam ko sarkaar gopneey bataa kar saajha nahin kar rahi thi use sadan ke patal par vitt mantri ne swayan bataa diya
 In fact, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that the new Rafael deal during the Modi government is worth 58000 crores
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki hamase poocha ja rahaa tha ki 1600 karod rupee kii keemat kahaan se ai, jo ki ek saadhaaran ganit he
 If Rs 58000 crore is divided by 36, then Rs 1600 crore will come
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se sawaal kiya ki jab vimaan kii keemat 1600 karod rupee tay kii ja rahi thi tab kya vayusena ke adhikari or raksha mantralay ke adhikariyon ne koi aapatti jaahir kii thi yaa nahin?even in the offer made to the UPA government there were two different prices one of the flyaway aircraft and the offer of the weaponised aircraft
 - Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley) January 2, 2019 Responding to Rahul Gandhi's statement, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in the tweet, 'how much do they know? When will you understand? Even a fool would not compare the prices of ordinary aircraft and armed aircraft
 upie sarkaar dauraan bhi ofer main bhi sade aircraft or hathiyaaryukt aicraft ke liye do alag daam the

 RTI main puche gaye tamaam sawaljal shakti mantralay se mili dhundhale javabpradhanmantri narendra modi ne haal main haryana ke charkhi dadri main chunavi sabha main vaada kiya ki nadiyon kaa jo pani bharat kaa he or pakistan ja rahaa he, use roak kar rukh jaldi hi haryana or rajasthan kii ore kiya jayega
 So that there can be benefit in farming
 modi ne kaha, '70 saalon se jis pani par bharat or haryana ke kisaanon kaa haq he, pakistan main bah rahaa he
 Modi will stop this water (from flowing into Pakistan) and bring it to your homes
 'ye pehali baar nahin he jab pradhanmantri modi ne pakistan kii taraf bahane vaale pani ko rokane kii baat kahi he
 He made a similar statement during the Lok Sabha elections on 8 May 2019 in Kurukshetra
 2016 main bhi unhone do baar milte julate bayaan die
 On 26 September 2016 in Delhi and then on 25 November 2016 in Bathinda, Punjab
 dilli main piem modi ne kaha tha, khun or pani saath-saath nahin bah sakate
 Modi was speaking after the terrorist attack on the army camp in Uri
 ye purana mudda he or piem modi or unki party ke netaaon kii ore ore se kai maukon par doharaaya jaataa rahaa he
 India Today, by filing a petition in the Ministry of Water Power under the Right to Information (RTI), wanted to know whether the Indian government has taken any step so far to stop the water going to Pakistan, what was it if taken? That the water power of the rivers lies with the Ministry of Water Power
 yahi mantralay pani ko rokane yaa uskaa rukh modane sambandhi faisla kar saktaa he
 We want to know the answers to these questions through RTI
 kya bharat sarkaar kii ore se beas, raavi or sutluj nadiyon se pakistan ko pani rokane kaa faisla liya ja chukaa he?2
 If yes, when was this decision taken? 3
 bharat sarkaar ne in teen purvi nadiyon ke pani ke puure hisse ke istemaal ke liye kya kadam uthaaya he?4
 Right now how much water is being used in India from these three rivers and how much is going to Pakistan? 5
 bharat in teen nadiyon kaa pani pakistan jane se puri tarah rokane kii sthiti main kab hoga?6
 In response to these questions, we were told, 'how much will it cost to take steps to stop the supply of water to Pakistan? In this context, it is mentioned that under the Indus Water Treaty (1960), India has to go to the eastern rivers (sutlej, Ravi and Beas) water is allocated with an average annual flow of 33 million acre feet (MAF)
 bharat kii ore se purvi nadiyon ke pani ke adhiktam istemaal ke liye storage, diavarjan or interlinking jaise kai projects kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Such as Bhakra Dam, Pong Dam, Ranjit Sagar Dam (thein Dam), beas-sutlej Link Project, madhopur-beas Link Project etc
 haalanki pani kaa kuch hissaa ab bhi, khaas taur par monsoon main, pakistan kii ore bahata he
 Many more projects are either at different stages of implementation or formulation, such as the Shahpurkandi dam project, Ujh multipurpose project, the second ravi-beas link project for optimum utilization of water of the eastern rivers
 in teen projecton ko rashtriya project ghoshit kiya gaya he or ye bharat sarkaar se vittiya sahaayta paane ke haqadaar honge
 'the Ministry did not give a clear answer to any of our questions, an appeal was filed for this
 apil ke jawaab main bataaya gaya-1
 With the signing of the Indus Water Treaty, several projects such as storage, diversion and interlinking have been worked out by the Government of India
 jaise ki bhakhda baandh, pong baandh, ranjit sagar baandh (thine baandh), beas-sutluj link project, madhopur-beas link project aadi
 They were constructed by India for optimum use of the waters of the eastern rivers
 2
 Apart from these, the Government of India is building several more projects on the Eastern Rivers such as Shahpurkandi Dam Project, Ujh Multipurpose Project, Second ravi-beas Link Project to use maximum part of the water of Eastern Rivers
 ye project yaa to lagu hone yaa nirupit hone ke vibhinn staron par hanhamaari apil ke baavjood hamane mul RTI main jo sawaal puche the, unamem kisi kaa bhi koi spasht jawaab nahin mila
 According to our understanding, the answers given by the Ministry of Water Power were not only vague but blurred
