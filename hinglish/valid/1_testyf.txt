 jab kisi padaarth ko vidyut yaa ooshmaa shakti dekar uttejit kiya jaataa he tab usase vibhinn varna kii rashmiyaan nikalne lagati hai
 Their spectrum can be obtained with the help of spectrographs

 Such spectrum is called band spectrum
 yadi padaarth ko bahut adhik urja di jaae to anu tut jate hai or padaarth ke parmaanu uttejit ho jate hai
 In the spectrum obtained from excited atoms, lines of different characters are found
 yah spectrum band spectrum se sarvatha bhinn hota he
 The band spectrum is obtained from molecules
 at: ise 'aanvik spectrum' bhi kehete hai
 In such a spectrum, one edge of each band or band is more visible
 is kinare ko band sheersh kehete hai
 Beyond the band head, the intensity of the stripe decreases gradually and often the top of the next band falls before the second edge is formed, or the intensity of this band is reduced to zero
 yadi prakharata ghatane kaa kram deergh tarang se laghu tarang kii ore hota he, to band ko bangnee avakramit or yadi yah kram laghu se deergh tarang kii ore hota he, to band ko laal avakramit kehete hai
 It is known from a good spectroscope that each band is a gradual community of many microscopic lines
 sheersh kii ore ye rekhaayen atyadhik saghan hoti jaati hai or punch kii ore kramash: viral hoti jaati hai
 The band spectrum is mainly of two types, absorption spectrum and emission spectrum
 padaarth ke vaashp ko uchit taap or daab par kisi nalee main band kar diya jaae or usamen se aviral rashmiyaan bheji jaaen, to vaashp dwaara kuch rashmiyaan avashoshit ho jaati hai
 The vapor of a substance, which can emit at very high temperatures, absorbs only those at low temperatures
 at: nalee se baahar aanevaali rashmiyon ke aviral spectrum main kaale kaale band paae jate hai
 Such spectrum is called absorption spectrum
 bahut si gaison main kam daab par vidyutdvisarjan karaane se bhi band spectrum praapt hota he
 These are called emission spectrums
 thos or drav padaarthon se avasorana or utsarjan band spectrum praapt karne ke liye unhen vaashp ke rup main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 Many substances start shining due to the effect of ultraviolet rays and visible light comes out of them
 ise pratidipti or sfuradipti kehete hai
 Band spectrums are also obtained by these methods

 The electrons of the last orbit are more independent
 unhen 'optical electron' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Eletronic energy is found in the atom due to the angular momentum of the electron

 Vegetation types in North America are based on a combination of the following parameters - climate patterns, plant habitats, phenology and / or growth types and dominant species
 The classification in the current US standard is hierarchical and incorporates non-fluorogenic parameters in the upper standards only in the lower two levels
 europe main, vargeekaran akasar bina jalwaayu, phenology yaa vikaas ke swaroopon ke bare main spasht baat kiye, adhiktar or kabhi-kabhi puri tarah floristic sanrachana par nirbhar karata he

 sabase nichalaa str, yaa sambandh, sabase sahi tareeke se paribhaashit he or ek prakaar kii ek se teen pramukh jatiyon ke naamon kaa samaves karata he
 For example, the definition of a vegetation type at the class level may be "forest, canopy cover> 60%", at the level of texture, "winter rain, broad-leaved, evergreen, sclerophyllous, closed canopy forest"; At the level of Mel, "arbutus Manizi One"; And at the level of the relationship, it is called "'arbutus mengisi - Lithocarpus densiflora forest", which is the Pacific madron-tannoque forest found in California and Origan, USA

 vanaspati main gatishiltaa ko mukhyatah jati kii sanrachana or / yaa vanaspati rachana ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Occasionally, a variety of processes or events can change, but for ease they can be divided into sudden or slow categories
 achaanak hone vaale parivartan saamanytah updrav kehalaate hai – inamen jangal kii aag, tej hawaaen, bhuskhalan, baadh, himaskhalan jaisi ghatnaayen shaamil hai
 The reasons for these are usually outside the community — these are natural processes that are independent of the natural processes of the community
 aisi ghatnaayen vanaspati rachana or jati kii sanrachana main bahut teji se or lambii samyavadhi ke liye parivartan laa sakati hai or vishaal kshetra ko prabhavit kar sakati hai
 There are very few ecosystems that do not have regular and frequent disturbances and are part of every long-term dynamic mechanism
 aag or hawa ke updrav vishwa bhar main anek vanaspati prakaaron main vishesh rup se aam hai
 Fire is particularly strong because it can destroy not only the living plants but also the seeds, spores and living meristems, which represent the next generation, and the fauna, soil properties and other ecosystems and other ecosystems

 Slow-temporal change is ubiquitous — it contains an area of eccentric rotation

 Furthermore, predicting the properties of such conditions, even if not reduced, is not always possible
 sankshipt main, vanaspati samudaay anek parivartakon par nirbhar hote hai jo milakar bhavishya kii dashaon kii sambhaavnaaon kii simaaen nishchit karte hai
 Botanists study the causes of the types and processes observed in vegetation at different scales of places and times

 Such questions often occur on a large scale and hence cannot be solved easily by using any manipulation
 That is why observational studies are very common in botany, with the help of knowledge of Vannasastra, Paleovanushastra, ecology, soil science etc

 In the United States, Henry Coles and Fredrik Clements developed ideas of vegetative rot in the early 20th century
 klement ab amaanya superarganism ke rup main vanaspati samudaay ke varnan ke liye prasiddh he
 He argued that just as all the organisms in a person work together to help the body work well and which develop together as a person becomes an adult, similarly in the vegetative community, every caste is very closely coordinated and Develops and co-ordinates with synergy and pushes the vegetation community to a defined and predetermined end state
 haalanki klements ne uttari american vanaspati par bahut kaary kiya, superarganism ke prati uski bhakthi ne uski pratishtha ko dhakka pahunchaaya he, kyonki anekon shodhakartaaon dwaara kiye gaye kaary main uske vichaar ko samarthan nahin mila he
 Contrary to Clements, many situational scientists have shown that the individual hypothesis, which states that the vegetation community is the total accumulation of a group of species reacting to the environment, is correct and decreases simultaneously in time and space
 remenski ne rus main yah vichaar prastut kiya or 1926 main henry gliyasana ne united stats main ise ek paper main viksit kiya
 Clementsian ideas had so much influence that Gliasson's ideas were rejected for many years
 lekin 1950 va 60 ke dashakon main rabart whitaker ke achchi tarah se taiyaar kiye gaye adhyayanon kii shrankhla ne gliyasana ke tarkon ke liye majabut saboot pesh kiye

 In studies of three very different montane ecosystems, Whitaker showed that castes react primarily to the environment and have no coordination with other nearby castes
 Other work, particularly on paleobotany, supports this idea over large temporal and spatial scales
 1960 ke dashak se, vanaspatilok par adhiktar shodh kaaryaatmak paristhitishastra ke vishyon par kendrit ho gaya he
 In the functional framework, taxonomy is of little importance and all research focuses on the species' anatomical, anatomical, and anatomical classification, and its purpose is to predict how specific groups will behave toward different environmental variables
 The basis of such an approach is the assumption that high levels of phylogenetic taxonomy and large spatial scales often do not have a strong correlation between phylogenetic expectation and environmental adaptation, particularly due to centripetal evolution and adapted radiation
 kaaryaatmak vargeekaran 1930 ke dashak main rankier ke epical meristemon ke sthaan par aadhaarit paudhon ke samoohon main vibhaajan ke saath shuru hua
 This was followed by other classifications such as macarthur's - r per k - selective race and the C-S-R scheme proposed by Grimes, in which castes according to one or more of three strategies, each favored by a selective pressure-competitive, coercion
 Is divided into tolerators and ruderals
 kaaryaatmak vargeekaran vanaspati-paryaavaran kii paraspar kriyaaon kii rachana main mahatvapurn hota he, jo ki vanaspati parishastra main pichley 30 se adhik varshon main mukhya vishay rahaa he
 Nowadays a lot of emphasis is being laid on the creation of local, regional and global vegetation changes in response to changes in world climate change, especially temperature, rainfall and disturbance

 It is generally believed that simple, all-purpose classifications will be replaced by more elaborate and functional classifications

 Kilimanjaro, with its three volcanic cones, Kibo, Mwenzie, and Shira, is a dormant Stratozhvalmukhi in northeastern Tanzania and is the highest mountain in Africa with a height of 5,895 meters or 19,341 feet above sea level
 Kilimanjaro Mountains is the highest free-standing mountain in the world as well as the fourth highest emerged mountain in the world which is 5,882 meters or 19,298 feet high from the base
 kilimanjaro naam kaa sateek arth or utpatti agyaat he
 It is believed to be a combination of the Swahili word Kilima and the Kichaga word Jaro, which translates to "whitewashed", from which the name White Mountain originated
 Another belief is that "jaro" in Chaga / Kichaga means 'our' and therefore Kilimanjaro means our mountain
 It is derived from the Chaga residents who live at the foothills of this mountain
 yah agyaat he ki kilimanjaro naam kahaan se aayaa he, lekin kai siddhant maujuud hai
 European explorers adopted the name by 1860 and stated that it was its Swahili name, and Kilimanjaro is divided into two parts, one is Kilima and the other is Jaro whose origin varies according to the principles - some people According to it is an ancient Swahili word meaning white or glow, or according to non-swahili origin it came from the Kichaga language, the word Jaro means "caravan"
 The problem with all of this is that they cannot explain why the term redundant kilima has been used instead of millima, the proper term for the mountain
 yah naam ek sthaneey hansi-mazaaq kaa hissaa ho saktaa he, jo "jaaro kii choti pahari" ko africa mahadweep kaa sabase bada pahaad sanderbhit karata he, kyonki yah paas kaa shahar he or guide bataate hai ki yah jaaro logon kii pahari he
 In a different view it is believed that it comes from Kichaga Kilmanare or Kiliajo which means "one who defeats birds / leopards / caravans"
 But this theory does not explain the fact that Kilimanjaro in Kitchaga was not used before in Europe in the mid-19th century
 1880 ke dashak main, yah parvat, jisaki german vartanee swahili naam ke ghatakon ke anusaar us samay kilima-ndscharo thi, german purv africa kaa ek hissaa ban gaya jab karl peters ne sthaneey mukhiyaaon ko sandhiyon par hastakshar karne ke liye manaaya 
 1889 main kibo shikhar kaa naam hanse mayer dwaara "kaisar-wilhem-spitje" rakhaa gaya, jab is shikhar par 5 oktober 1889 ko pehali baar chadhaai kii gai
 The name was used until 1918, when German colonies were given to the British Empire after World War I
 jab british prashasit tanganyika ko 1961 main apni swatantraaa praapt hui, to is shikhar kaa naam "uhuru shikhar" rakhaa gaya, jiskaa swahili main arth hota he "swatantraaa shikhar"
 The key-prefix has many underlying meanings in Swahili
 pracheen kaa-alparthak sangya upsarg ko, kii varg ke saath vilay kar diya gaya
 It has another meaning under which it describes anything unique: Kilima, a single peak, unlike Milima, which describes more of a mountain range or uneven country
 kai anya parvaton main bhi yah upsarg laga hua he, jaise ki kilima bogo jo kenya main nairobi ke bilkul uttar main sthit he
 People with disabilities are also placed in the same category, which is not that much of a diminutive idea; Rather a unique situation in which they are: a blind or deaf person, Kipofu and Kiziwi
 This prefix "ki-" does not imply derogatory meaning in any way

 Kilimanjaro mountain is the highest mountain in Africa and the fourth highest among the seven peaks

 Kilimanjaro is composed of three different volcanic cones: Kibo 5,895 m॰; Mawenzi 5,149 m and vein 3,962 m
 The Uhuru peak is the highest peak on Kibo's volcanic cavity

 There are six official climbing routes through which Mount Kilimanjaro can be climbed, their names are: Marangue, Rongai, Lemosho, Shira, Umbwe and Machame
 Of all the routes, Machame is quite panoramic, though its climb up the mountain is quite steep, which can be completed in six or seven days
 rongai sabase aasaan shivi maarg he or marangu bhi apekshaakrit aasaan he, lekin awaas jhopadiyon main hota he
 As a result, this route becomes very busy and the ascent and descent route is the same
 jo log kilimanjaro par chadhaai karnaa chaahate hai unhen upyukt shodh karne kii salaah di jaati he or yah sunishchit karne ke liye kaha jaataa he ki ve uchit rup se las hai or shaareerik rup se sakasham hai
 Although this climb is not technically as challenging as climbing the summit of the Himalayas, the high altitude, low temperatures and occasional strong winds make it a difficult and dangerous climb
 jalwaayu-anukulan jaruri he or iske baad bhi sabase anbhavi parvatarohi bhi tungta bimaari se kuch had tak peedit hote hai
 The Kilimanjaro peak is so high that at that height high altitude pulmonary edema, or high altitude cerebral edema may occur

 High altitude clubs have criticized Tanzanian authorities for charging fees for each day spent on the mountain
 isse parvatarohi samay or paisa bachaane ke liye teji se chadhaai karne ke liye protsaahit honge, jabaki uchit jalwaayu-anukulan kii maang he ki kisi bhi ucch chadhaai karne ke liye deree ko apanaaya jaataa he
 Tanzanian medical services around the mountain have recently expressed concern over the growing influx of tourists who consider Kilimanjaro apparently an easy climb
 haalanki, maamla yah nahin he
 Many individuals require significant attention during their endeavor and many are forced to abandon their ascent
 is maamle main ek jaanch ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki tanzania jane vaale paryatakon ko aksar chadhaai karne vaale samoohon main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he bina yah bataae ki iske liye shaareerik swasthata kii anivaaryta kitni mahatvapurn he, haalanki kai saamagree vikreta or tour oparator shikhar tak pahunchane kii ucch safalataa dar kaa dikhaava karte hai
 Kilimanjaro National Park shows that only 30% of climbers actually reach the Uhru summit while most climbers return 300 meters below Uhru, at Gilman Point or 200 meters below Uhuru from Stella Point
 kilimanjaro ko aksar kam aanka jaataa he kyonki yah ek takneekee chadhaai nahin he
 However, many climbers consider Kilimanjaro to be physically very difficult climbs
 kuch logon kaa anumaan he ki mount everest kii tulana main kilimanjaro par chadhaai karte samay adhik logon ne apni jaan ganvaai he jabaki everest par apekshaakrit bahut kam parvatarohiyon ne chadhaai kaa prayaas kiya he

 The majority of these dead are wearers who are killed by hypothermia

 For this reason, the route passing the Arrow Glacier was closed for several years

 To climb the Arrow Glacier route, climbers must leave early in the morning and cross the rocky surface before mid-afternoon because when the sun comes out, non-glacial rock ejaculation becomes quite common

 The low level of endemism at Kilimanjaro can lead to the destruction of low altitude forests, not the relatively young age of the mountains
 Another feature of Kilimanjaro's forests is the lack of bamboo area, which is present on all other high mountains with high rainfall, similar to East Africa
 sinarundineria alpina ko bhens or haathiyon dwaara pasand kiya jaataa he
 These killers on Kilimanjaro are found on the northern slope, where the area is dry for a long bamboo field

 This interaction of biological and abiotic factors may not only explain the lack of bamboo area at Kilimanjaro but may provide a possible explanation for the pattern and endemism of diversity

 Several contributions to Unix have previously appeared on BSD releases, particularly with work control over the c shell
 Perhaps the most important aspect of BSD development efforts included TCP / IP network code in the mainstream Unix kernel

 AT&T added various features to the Unix v system as lock files, including system administration streams, new forms of IPC, remote file system and TLI
 AT&T worked with Sun Microsystems and merged features from Xenix, BSD, Sun OS, System v between 1987 and 1989 independently of x / Open in System v Release 4

 In 1990, the Open Soft Wear Foundation released OSF / 1, their standard Unix implementation based on make and BSD
 The foundation started in 1988 and was nurtured by several Unix-related companies that opposed AT&T and Sun's cooperation on SVR4

 The court ruled that "SCO is not bound by ibm's and Secante's claim of recognizing Novell's abandonment"
 After the decision, Novell announced and said he was not interested in suing the people of Unix, we do not believe there is Unix in Linux

 An open operational system standardization of the late 1980s, now known as POSIX, attempts to provide a common baseline for all operational mechanisms
 unics pranali ke pramukh prati spardhi kismo main aiii aadhaarit posix lagbhag saadhaaran sanrachana 1988 main posix ke pratham sanskaran main prakashit kiya gaya
 a separate but substantially similar effort was initiated by an industry association in the 1990s, the initiative of the Common Free Software Environment Kos, which eventually became a single Unix specialty administered by the Open Group
 posix or ekal unics vishistataa ko ek aam paribhaasha pradaan karne ke liye 1998 main open samooh or IEEE ne austin samooh shuru kiya
 In an effort for compatibility, in 1999 several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4 executable and contactable formats as the standard for dual and object signal files

 The inclusion of these components did not make the system larger - the original V7 Unix distribution, all copies of the compiled coupler, as well as all source signals and documents less than 10 MB full and delivered on a single 9 trek magnetized tape

 Although this led to Multics and Burrows, it was Unix that popularized the idea

 Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system, originally introduced by Multics, with an arbitrary subdirectory
 Other common operating systems of the era were storing multiple directories or classes of storage devices, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level
 Several major proprietary operating mechanisms eventually added recurring subdirectory capabilities and remained the norm after Mutlix
