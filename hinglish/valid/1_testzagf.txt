 The lyrics and their meanings are as follows: Out of the night that covers me,black as the pit from pole to pole,i thank whatever gods may befor my unconquerable soul
in the fell clutch of circumstancei have not winced nor cried aloud
under the bludgeonings of chancemy head is bloody, but unbowed
beyond this place of wrath and tearslooms but the Horror of the shade,and yet the menace of the yearsfinds and shall find me unafraid
it matters not how strait the gate,how charged with punishments the scroll
i am the master of my fate:i am the captain of my soul
 Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, came than what ever God was before i made an unconquerable soul
 Fet mae was is bloody but unboud
 Nafred
 It Matters Not How Straight the Gate, Who Charged with Punishments the Scroll

 And then on 10 June, Mary Modena gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, and the Protestants found themselves looking at the possibility of a Catholic dynasty
 30 june 1688 par paanch hindi saathiyon or do maharaaje james damaad or bhattije orange ke rajkumaar dwaara sena england par akraman karne ke liye ek aamantran bheja tha
 On September 28, James published a proclamation against the upcoming invasion

 James believed he would prevail, and turned down offers of military aid from Louis XIV of France
 lekin jab santare ke wiliam kii dakshin pashchim england main brickshham main 5 navambar 1688 par 'gauravshaalee kranti' kii shuruyaat main utraa, james sena ke bahut use nishtha band; or yahaan tak ki james choti beti eni wiliam or mariyam ke samarthan main baahar aayaa
 On 11 December 1688, James VII / II tried to escape to France
 vah kent main pakadaa gaya tha, lekin wiliam use 23 disambar 1688 par chhodane ke liye anumati di
 By James Louis XIV, who was welcomed to offer him a palace and a large pension

 Opinions were fairly evenly divided and for a while it was possible that James VII could be declared the real king of the Scots

 haalanki vah victoria kaa putr va uttaradhikari tha edward saptam ne apane pita kaa upnaam apanaaya or is vajah se great britain main ek nayaa rajgharaana ban gaya
 The power and sovereignty of the king, the state and the umbrella, and the punishment given to an offender for his crime is called punishment
 ek duusare sandarbh main, raajnneetishastra ke chaar upayon - sam, daam, dand or bhed main ek upaay
 The literal meaning of punishment is 'stick' by which one is beaten
 sanskaragat kshetra main mukhya rup se brahmacharee vidhyaarthee ke dwaara dhaaran kiye janevaale dand kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 Detailed descriptions of it are found in the Grihyasutras, Smriti, their commentaries, Vrhat Samhita and other texts of theology generally
 tadnusaar brahman, kshatriya or vaisya balak bhinn bhinn avasthaaon main jab acharya ke dwaara yajyavidhi se upanayan sanskaar se sanskrit hote hai to unhen saumyadarshan or anudvegkar dand bhi dhaaran karne hote hai
 The scriptural laws and traditional beliefs are that a Brahmin child should bear the punishment of Vilvandand, Kshatriya child, Lalapataryant Palashdand and Vaisyabalak Nasikaparyant Udumbar
 dand shabd kaa mukhya rup se prayog raajnneetishastra or prashasan ke sambandh main kiya jaataa he
 The punishment by which criminals are punished is the same, but it is used within the limits of state and government
 jab rajya kii seemaa ke baahar kisi, shatru, mitra, madhyasth athwa udasin rajya ke prati uskaa prayog kiya jaay to vah raajnneeti ke chaar upayon main ek ho jaataa he or usase taatpary hota he sainya prayog kaa
 The scripture that deals with the consideration of these things is penal and its policy is punishment
 dandniti sarkaar or prashasan kaa vigyaan he, jiskaa aadhaar he naitikta or vidhi kaa paalan, jo dand dhaaran karanevaale tathaa dand paanevaale donon hi par samaan rup se lagu hoti he
 Folk tour is not possible without him
 
 According to the definition of Kamandaka Nitisara and Mahabharata, suppression of crimes is called punishments or "policy"
 is kaary ko karanevaala arthath is gun kaa pratik raja 'dandi' kehalaata he, nayan ke kaaran
 Shankaracharya has quoted Manusmriti while commenting on Kamandaka, where it has been said that the enjoyment of the world is possible only due to the fear of total public punishment
 spasht he, bhartiya raajnneetishastra main dand kaa atyadhik mahatv tha jo vaastavik or pratikatmak, donon swaroopon se vyakt hota tha
 Many things have been said in Manusmriti about punishment
 manu kehete hai ki jo dand he vahi raja, vahi nyaay kaa prachaarkartta or sab kaa shashankartta, vahi chaar varna or ashramon ke dharm kaa pratibhu arthath jamin he
 The same king and the ruler of the subject, the protector of all the subjects, awakens among the sleeping people, that's why intelligent people call punishment as religion
 yadi raja dand ko achche prakaar vichaar se dhaaran kare to vah sab praja ko anandit kar detaa he or jo vina vichaare chalaaya jaay to sab ore se raja kaa vinaash kar detaa he
 All the characters of the punishment without punishment, ie the subjects are corrupted and all dignity becomes discolored
 dand ke yathavat na hone se sab logon kaa raja va rajya vyavastha ke viruddh prakope ho saktaa he
 It is also said that the punishment is very bright, which the unbeliever and godless cannot bear
 tab aisi sthiti main vah dand dharm se rahit raja va uske kutumb kaa hi naash kar detaa he
 It has also been said that a king who is devoid of education, obsessed and foolish in subjects, can never be able to punish with justice
 dand kii utpatti rajyasanstha kii utpatti ke saath hui
 In the Manusmriti and Mahabharata it has been said that the initial condition of mankind was of very pious nature, faultless deeds, virtue and seasons, when there was neither the position of a king, nor the kingdom, nor the punishment, nor the punishment and all the people
 They used to protect each other through religion
 kintu kalantar main tamasgunon kaa prabalya badhane laga, manushya samaaj apni aadim satv prakruti se chyut ho gaya or matsay nyaay chaa gaya
 The powerful started eating the weak
 aisi sthiti main rajya or raja kii utpatti hui or sabko sahi raaston par rakhane ke liye dand kaa vidhaan hua
 Punishment became a symbol of state power, which was the ruler, protector of all the subjects and awakened to sleep
 at: dand ko hi dharm sweekaar kiya gaya 
 It seems clear from this that the seeker of religion was considered as punishment only
 vah dharm jisamen arth or kaam bhi samahit he arthath dand trivarg kaa sadhak sweekrut hua
 Punishment was required to remove ejaculation from the norm
 rajya kii shakti ke rup main dand nyaayik kshetra main prasaarit hone laga
 Its purpose was to protect the beliefs and status quo of society and religion
 vah yathasthiti dharm ke naam se abhihit thi or dharm ke bhi varna, jati, ashram, desh, kaal, samooh, varg, parivaar or vyavsaay aadi bhedon par aadhaarit or bhinn bhinn roopon main maanya anek prakaar the, jinka gyaan dharmasanasth dandakartta ke liye atyaavashyak hota tha
 The king who used punishment also used to be punished if he violated religion
 dharm arthath vidhi se pare koi na tha dharm raajaaon kaa bhi raja tha
 The head of the state or any other power, such as the head of the republic, was the head of the judicial organization, but he could never be the head of the law, and the punishment would be on him for violating the law
 bharat main vidhi or dand kii yah samprabhutaa brahmankaal se lekar manusmriti or mahabharat ke yug ke bich viksit hui dikhaai detii he
 Modern jurisprudence believes four principles of punishment - sabhi deshon main samaaj kii atyant praarambhik avasthaa pratikaratmak dand kii thi, jisamen aankh ke badale aankh or daant ke badale daant kaa siddhant chalata tha
 Nouns like "biography" of Vedic literature indicate that the justice of the very early period of Indian history was harsh and symbolic
 is siddhanth kii manyata he ki ek apradhi ko kathor dand dene se duusare log aparaadh karne se darate hai
 The prohibitive principle holds that by punishing the offender, the person who has committed the crime gets his 'revenge'
 yah sabhi siddhanton main sabase bura siddhanth he kyonki isamen samaaj kaa kalyaan yaa samaaj kii suraksha kii bhaavana nahin he
 In the third stage the form of punishment became obstructive instead of symbolic
 iskaa kaaran tha doshi manushya ke prati dosha kiye gaye hue manushya kaa nipat lene ke bajaay dand dhaaran karanevaale rajya kaa bich main aa janaa
 Establishing the glory of state punishment by ending personal vendetta became a sign of the state's purpose and its growing power
 divaani ke maamalon main arthdand aadi dwaara dosha kiye gaye hue vyakti ko kuch badla dilaanaa yadhyapi vaid mana gaya, faujadaari ke maamalon main badla lenaa ab asambhav tha
 But harsh - at times it was often a rule to give extremely cruel and rude punishments
 yadi ham upanishdon ke daivadandon, baudhdhagranthon main varnit dandon, arthshaastra ke dwaara haath paanv kaat liye jane kii anushansaaon tathaa megesthnij dwaara kii janevaali uski sampushtiyon ko dekhen athwa purv or pashchim donon hi ore prachlit madhyakaalin or kuch had tak aadhunik kaal ke prarambh tak ke dandon kaa vivechan karen to yah kahana hoga ki ve atyant hi krur or aadhunik drushti se barbar the
 Their aim was to instill fear in others to commit crimes
 inamen ang-bhang, jivit jala diya janaa, mrityudand, aaajeevan karawas or asay yaatnaaon se bhare hue dand hote hai
 Preventive punishments include a measure to restrain the cause of the crime or his future doer, which is accomplished by taking away his personal freedom
 bharatvarsh kaa nirodhak jail vidhaan isi shrenee main he
 The fourth and best type of punishment is corrective
 sabhyataa ke vikaas ke kram main bhi yadhyapi sabhi deshon main sambhavit doshiyon ke prati dosha ke gambhir parinaam or dandyatnaaon kaa bhay upasthit karne ke liy kathor avarohak dand die jate rahe hai, par kabhi-kabhi sudharatmak pravritiyaan bhi uthati rahi hai
 In ancient Rome, the loss of the freedom of the guilty was considered the greatest punishment, and no torture was considered necessary thereafter
 bharatvarsh main kautilya ne karagraston ko praayshchitt karaane or apane paapon kaa bodh karaane kii vyavastha ke dwaara unhen vishuddh karaane kaa ullekh kiya he
 Ashoka, in his fourth column, has also ordered to reduce the punishments of the pure-witted, virtuous and good-natured convicts with behavior and punishments
 ye baaten dand vidhaan kii sudharatmak pravriti kii dyotak hai
 Memories include discussions of dhigdand or wagdand, which always preceded the judgments and slaughter
 uskaa taatpary yah tha ki saamaajik ninda maatr se yadi kaam chal jaay to kathor yaatnaaon kii aavashyaktaayen hi kya ? ek niyam to sarvamaanya tha or vah yah ki dand "yathaahe" ho or vah aaptdosh hone par hi diya janaa chahie
 In the 20th century, efforts are being made to give corrective form to the punishments
 1872 i main landan main ek antarrashtriya jail sudhaar or dandvidhaan ke kisi antarrashtriya swaroop ko nishchit karne ke liye sabha hui
 Later on, collective associations were also established, but its members remained mostly European countries
 dhire dhire kathor dandon ke sthaan par karagrast doshi ke naitik jivan kaa punarujjiwan lakshya mana jane laga
 There is hope more than fear
 dand ke sudharatmak siddhant main uskaa vidhaan doshi kii avasthaa, saamaajik vaataavaran or sthitivishesh ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Society and environment are also considered responsible for defects
 at: doshi ko sudhaarney ke liye manovaigyanik upayon kaa prayog, uskaa vaiyaktik str par vichaar, doshi baalkon ke liy sudharbhawanon kii vyavastha, audyogic shiksha, saadhaaran shiksha, naitik or dharmik vyaakhyaan or anya suniyojit vyavasthaayen kii jaati hai
 Like in some other countries in India too, efforts are on to make jobs and labor in dams, roads or other constructions that bind the prisoners, or to make social utility and family service through industrial education
 asambhav nahin ki kuch sadiyon main vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa apharan maatr sabase bada dand mana jaay or maanav swabhaav itnaa udaatt or pavitra ho jaye ki pranaharan or aaajeevan kathor karawas jaise dandon kii aavashyaktaa hi na rahe
 Psychosis or schizophrenia is a mental disorder
 isaki visheshtaayen hai- asaamaanya saamaajik vyavhaar tathaa vaastavik ko pahchaan paane main asamarthta
 This disorder is found in about 1% of people
 is rog main rogi ke vichaar, samveg tathaa vyavhaar main asaamanya badlaav aa jate hai jinke kaaran vah kuch samay liye apni jimmedaariyon tathaa apni dekhbhaal karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Both 'psychosis' and 'schizophrenia' literally mean 'breakdown of mind'
 sizophrenia ke kuch pramukh lakshan hai, jaise ki shuruuaat main :- It is not necessary that all these symptoms are seen in every patient, so if any of these symptoms are seen in any person, then he should seek psychiatric advice immediately
 schizophrenia kisi bhi jati, varg, dharm, ling, yaa umr ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Like other diseases, the disease can also be inherited from close family members, so it is more likely to occur in the patient's children, or siblings
 atyadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone dene kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Chemical changes in the brain or sometimes any brain injury can also cause this disease
 neeche die vyavhaarik badlaav rogi ko bigadati avasthaa ke sanket ho sakate hai :- If you feel that a person has these symptoms: - in anaavashyak prabhaavon ke hone par dawa kaa seven roke nahin kyonki yah prabhaav samay ke saath apane aap hi kam ho jate hai tathaa inako rokane ke liye saamaanya si saavdhaaniyaan bhi rakhi ja sakati hai, jaise :- The patient of schizophrenia can lead a perfectly normal life after taking the medication after the main symptoms go away
 vah apni kshamta ke anusaar naukari kar saktaa he, pard saktaa he, dost bana saktaa he tathaa apane sabhi sapane puure kar saktaa he
 a schizophrenia patient can marry after symptom-free, but he has to take care that the new changes in his life do not affect his sleep and medication
 yadi rogi stri hai to vah bina chikitsakeey salaah ke garbh dhaaran na karen
 In children with schizophrenia, the disease can be inherited, but it is not always necessary
 schizophrenia grasit koi vyakti shravan sambandhi vibhram, mithyabhram or asangathit tathaa aswabhaavik soch evam bhashaa pradarshit kar saktaa he; yah vichaar kii shrinkhalaa or vishay pravaah main nuksaan, jisamen vaakya arth kii drushti se keval aspasht rup se sambandhit hote hai, se lekar gambhir maamalon main asambandhata, jise shabd kaa salad kaha jaataa he, tak ho saktaa he
 Social segregation usually arises for various reasons
 saamaajik bodh main kshati sizophrenia se usee prakaar se sambandhit he, jis prakaar mithyabhram or vibhram se pairanoiya ke lakshan or evolision ke nakaaratmak lakshan sambandhit hai
 In an unusual subsystem, may remain stationary in the odd posture, or may display aimless stimuli; These are all symptoms of catatonia
 koi ek lakshan sizophrenia ke nidaan se sambandhit nahin he or sabhi anya chikitsa or maansik sthitiyon main ho sakate hai
 The current classification of psychiatrists assumes that disease symptoms must be present for at least one month over a period of at least six months of disturbed activity
 choti avadhi kii sizophrenia jaisi manovikruti ko chizophrenia rupi vikruti kaha jaataa he
 Late adolescence and early adulthood are the peak times of onset of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia kaa upachaar kiye jane vaale 40% purushon or 23% mahilaon main, yah sthiti 19 varsh kii umr se pehle utpann hui
 These are very important periods in the social and professional development of a young adult and can be severely hampered
 sizophrenia ke prabhaav ko kam se kam karne ke liye, beemaari ke praarambhik charan kii pahchaan karne or uskaa upachaar karne ke liye haal hi main paryaapt kaary kiye gaye hai, jiskaa pataa rog lakshanon ke shuru hone ke pehle 30 maheenon tak lagaaya gaya he, lekin ve adhik lambey samay tak upasthit rah sakate hai
 People who develop schizophrenia experience non-specific symptoms of social breakdown, irritability and restlessness in the early period, and transient or auto-limiting psychosis related symptoms in the early stages before the psychosis becomes apparent
 Can
 manochikitsak kurt shenidar ne manorog sambandhi lakshanon ke roopon ko soochibaddh kiya jise unhone mana ki ve schizophrenia ko anya manorog sambandhi vikaron se bhinn karte the
 These are called first-class signs or first-class symptoms of shenider and they include false illusions in the category of being controlled by an external force; The belief that thoughts are being put into one's conscious mind or withdrawn from it; The belief that the views of one person are being transmitted to other people; And listening for confused voices that comment on a person's thoughts or activities or have a conversation with other confused voices
 haalanki unhone vartmaan naidanik mandandon main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, pratham shrenee ke lakshanon kii vishistataa par prashn uthaaye gaye hai
 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia
 unamem mithyaa bhram, shravan sambandhi vibhram or soch sambandhi vikaar shaamil hote hai or unhen vishesh rup se manovikruti kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he
 Negative symptoms are those that are not present in individuals affected by schizophrenia but are typically found in healthy people, that is, symptoms that reflect a loss or loss of general characteristics or abilities
 aam nakaaratmak lakshanon main neeras yaa kunthit karne vaale prabhaav or manobhaav, bhashaa main kripanata, anand kii anubhuti karne kii aakshamata, sambandh sthapit karne kii ichha kaa abhaav or prerana kii kami shaamil hai
 Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life, functional disability, and burden on others than positive symptoms
 kunthit karne vaale prabhaav kii upasthiti ke baavjood, haal ke adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki schizophrenia main aksar ek saamaanya yaa bhavukta kaa ucch str bhi paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se tanaavpurn yaa nakaaratmak ghatnaon ke pratikriyaswaroop aisa hota he
 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior
 anya lakshan vargeekaran kaa pramaan maujuud he
 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication
 manovikruti sambandhi lakshan kai anya maansik bimariyon main maujuud rahete hai, jisamen dwidhruvi vikaar, vyaktitv seemaa rekha vikaar, sickefective vikaar, madhpan, madhpan nashile-padaarth dwaara prerit manovikruti or schizophrenia swarupi vikaar
 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists
 isi kram main ming tsang or uske sahyogi is baat par paricharchaa va bahes karte hai ki manovikruti ke lakshan sabhi main saamaanya ho sakate hai bhale hi iske antim str kii vikruti par vibhinnataayen ho sakati hai, jisamen schizophrenia ko shaamil kiya gaya he, bajaae iske ki schizophrenia kii ateology yaa hetuvigyaan ke vishisht vishaleshan par sachet karte hai ki dsam ke sambandh main bahut kam parichaalanaatmak paribhaasha schizophrenia ke nirmaan par "sahi" uplabdh he
 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes
 schizophrenia main janankshmata kii kamajori ke vidyaman hone kii bahut hi kam shankaa kii jaati he
 The affected person has fewer children than normal people
 is prakaar kii kami 70% purushon or 30% mahilaon main dekhi gai he
 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later
 ek prakaar ke isi jigyaasu nishkarsh se yah pataa chalaa he ki schizophrenia se prabhavit logon main se zyaadaatar log thand yaa basant ke mausam main janmen the 
 ab iske kai udhaaharan maujuud hai ki janmpurv iske sankraman ke prabhaav main aa jane se jivan ke baad ke varshon main bhi schizophrenia kaa vikaas ho jaataa he, basharte isaki alaava udaahranon main utero pathology or is avasthiti ke vikaas ke jokhim ke bich ko kadi ho
 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia

 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia

 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation
 adhik virdohi do network ke bich sahasambandh network ke bich atyadhik pratidwandvita pataa chalata he
 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue
 aise vyakti jo 'atyadhik jokhimpurna maansik avasthaa' kii shrenee main aate hai, jinamein sizophrenia kii paariwarik prishrubhumi ke sathsath asthaayee yaa swaniyantrit manovikrutiyon ke lakshan bhamil hai, unamem ek vashar ke baad kii paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par ilaaj kii sambhaavna 2040 pratit tak hoti he
 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he
 Its treatment was discovered in the mid-1950s with the development and presentation of chlorpromazine

 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization

 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done

 There is a belief among many non-western communities that schizophrenia can only be treated in more informal, community-controlled ways

 Many practitioners and researchers suspect that differences in respective levels of social engagement and acceptance are one of the reasons, however, that cultural studies are still needed to explain these results

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained

 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency
 sizophrenia se peedit mahilaon main asaamaanya manovikruti rodhi istemaal karne par prolactin ilveshan kaa asar dekha gaya he

 Cognitive behavioral therapy is used for specific symptoms and is used to diagnose other symptoms such as self-esteem, social initiation and insight
 However, the results of prior tests did not reach any conclusion
 chunki ab ye therapy 1990 ke shishav kaal se ab tak kaaphi pragati kar chuki he, haal hi main hue kuch punarnirikshanon se ye maaloom hua he ki CBT kii chikitsa sizophrenia ke psycotic lakshanon par kargar hoti he
 Another type is Cognitive Remediation Therapy, a technique that is sometimes treated with neurocognitive deficiency present in schizophrenia

 Training of social work has produced both positive and negative results
 kuch pareekshanon ne kuch srujanaatmak va khaskar sangeet chikitsa ke bhi sakaaratmak parinaamon ke sanket diye hai
 The Soteria model is also another option in which treatment is done in the hospital itself but with minimal medication use

 An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to devices participating in a computer network using the Internet Protocol for communication between its nodes
 ek IP adress do pramukh kaary karata he: mejabaan yaa network interfes pahchaan or sthaan parichayan
 isaki bhoomika kaa charitrachitran is prakaar he: "ek naam ingit karata he ki ham kya maangate hai
 An address indicates where he is
 ek maarg ingit karata he ki vahaan tak kaise pahunchen
" The designer of TCP / IP defined the IP address as a 32-bit number, and the system, known as Internet Protocol version 4 or ipv4, is still in use today
 baharhaal, internet ke vyapak vikaas or iske parinamswaroop uplabdh paton kii kami ke kaaran, 1995 main adress ke liye 128 bit upyog kar ke ek nayaa parichayan system, viksit kiya gaya or pichhali baar 1998 main RFC 2460 dwaara manakikrut kiya gaya

 As the development of private networks raised the threat of ipv4 address termination, RFC 1918 set out a set of private address spaces that could be used by anyone on a private network
 vah vaishvik saarvajanik internet se judane ke liye, aksar network adress anuvadak ke saath upyog kiye jate hai
 The Internet Assigned Number Authority, which manages universal IP address space allocation, supports five regional Internet registries to allocate IP blocks to local Internet registries and other entities
 internet protocol ke do sanskaran upyog main hai: ai pi sanskaran 4 or ypi sanskaran 6

) prayek sanskaran ek ypi adress ko alag dhang se paribhaashit karata he
 Because of its prevalence, the generic term IP address generally still refers to the address defined by ipv4
 ipv4, 32-bit adress kaa upyog karata he, jo adress sthaan ko 4,294,967,296 ) sambhav adwitiya adress par simit karata hai
 ipv4 reserves some addresses for special purposes such as private networks or multicast addresses
 isse ant upyogkartaaon ko niyat kiye jane vaale paton kii sankhya kam ho jaati he or jaise hi uplabdh paton kii sankhya kshay ho jaati he, ipv4 pataa samaapan nishchit ho jaataa he
 This foreseeable shortfall was the primary motivation for developing ipv6, which is in various deployment stages around the world, as the only strategy for ipv4 replacement and continued expansion of the Internet
 ipv4 adress aamtaur par dot-dashamalav sanketan main darshaae jate hai 
 Each part represents 8 bits of address and is therefore called octet
 takneekee lekhan ke kam aam maamalon main, ipv4 adress, shodash aadhari, ashtadhari, yaa binary abhivedan main prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Each octet is changed individually in the most representation
 internet protocol ke vikaas ke praarambhik charan main, network ke prashaskon ne IP adress kaa do bhaagon main varnan kiya, network sankhya bhaag or mejabaan sankhya main bhaag
 ek adress main sarvocch kram ocotate ko network number abhinihit kiya jaataa tha or baaki ke bits rest field yaa host identiphire kehalaae jate the or network ke abhyantar mezbaan sankhyankan ke liye istemaal kiye jate the
 This method soon proved to be analogous as soon as additional networks were developed that were independent of the existing networks, which would have already been characterized by a network number
 1981 main, classphul network sanrachana ke samaveshan ke saath internet parichayan vinirdesh main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 Classful network design allowed a large number of individual network tasks
 ek IP adress ke sabase mahatvapurn ocotate ke pehle teen bit, adress kii shrenee ke rup main paribhaashit kiye gaye
 Three categories were defined for universal unicast detection
 vyutpann varg ke aadhaar par network pahchaan puure pate ke octate seemaa kshetron par aadhaarit tha
 Each category used sequentially extra octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the number of possible hosts in the higher class category
 nimna talika is faltah aprachlit pranali kaa ek simhavlokan detaa he
 The description of this design is explained in the article 'subnetwork' and 'classful Network'
 haalanki classphul network abhikalp ek safal vikasaatmak avasthaa thi lekin internet ke betahasha vistaar ke kaaran ise aage badhanaa mushkil ho gaya or jab nae ypi adress khand dene ke liye classles inter-domen rooting kaa srijan kiya gaya or rooting protocol ke liye ipivi4 adress kaa prayog karne ke liye nae niyam taiyaar kiye gaye to ise chhod diya gaya
 CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking for the allocation and routing of arbitrary-length prefixes
 aaj, classphul network sankalpana ke avshisht keval ek simit kshetra main kaam karte hai jo ki kuch network software or hardware ghatakon ke diphalt kanfigration maapdand hai or network prashaskon kii charchaa ke takneekee jorganon main prayukt hote hai
 In the initial network design, when the idea of connecting all Internet users globally from one bite to another for communication was intended, each computer or device had a unique IP address
 lekin yah paaya gaya ki hameshaa aisa kar paanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki nijee network viksit ho gaye or saarvajanik paton kaa sthaan sangrakshit karne kii jarurat padi 
 Computers that are not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only through TCP / IP, are not required to have a globally unique IP address
 nijee network ke liye ipv4 paton main se teen simaaen, har varg ke liye ek seemaa, 1918 RFC main arakshit thi
 These addresses are not routed over the Internet and hence there is no need to coordinate them with the register of IP addresses
 aaj, jab jarurat padati he, aise nijee network aamtaur par network pataa anuwaad ke madhyam se internet se conect ho jate hai

 The IP version 4 address space is rapidly approaching the closing of its officially available allocated address segments

 Its permanent solution, a redesign of the Internet protocol itself, was understood
 internet protocol kii yah agali peedi, jiskaa uddeshy internet par ipv4 kii jagah lenaa tha, antat 1995 main ise internet protocol sanskaran 6 kaa naam diya gaya
 The address size was increased from 32 to 128 bit or 16 octets, which, even with a generous working of network blocks, is considered sufficient for the foreseeable future
 ganitiya, nayaa adress sthaan, adhiktam 2, yaa lagbhag 3
403×10 adwitiya pate kii kshamta pradaan karata he
 The new design is not only based on the goal of providing a sufficient amount of addresses, but to allow efficient aggregation of subnet routing prefixes to occur on the routing nodes
 parinamswaroop, anumaargan talika aakaar chota hota hai or sabase chota sambhav vyaktigat aavanton 264 host ke liye ek sabanet he, jo puure ipv4 internet ke aakaar kaa vargakar he
 At these levels, the actual address usage rate will be smaller on any ipv6 network segment

 ipv6 has features that, if there is a change in global connectivity or routing policy, automatically change the routing prefix of the entire network without internal redesigns or new numbering
 ipv6 paton kii badi sankhya vishisht prayojanon ke liye bade block nirdisht karne kii anumati dete he or jahaan uchit he, kushal maarg ke liye ekatrit hone kii
 a complex address protection technique with a large address space is not required, such as Classless used in inter-domain routing
 sabalmodern ke anusaar desktop or udhyam sarwar oparating system ipv6 protocol ke liye nishkapat samarthan shaamil karte hai, lekin yah abhi tak anya upkarnon jaise home netwarking raootraz, vois over internet protocol or multimedia upkaran or network paridhiy main vyapak rup se tainaat nahin hai
 Example of an ipv6 address: jaise ipv4 nijee yaa aantarik network ke liye adress arakshit karata he, ipv6 main nijee adress ke liye adress ke vibhaag alag se samucchy kiye hote hai
 In ipv6, these are referred to as unique local addresses
 RFC 4,193 is vibhaag ke liye anumaargan upsarg fc00:: / 7 alag se samucchy karata he, jo ki vibhinn uplakshith nitiyon ke saath do / 8 vibhaagon main vibhajit he adress main ek 40 bit chhadam yadrichhik sankhya shaamil hoti he jo sait vilay yaa packet ke galat maarg par chal jane se hone vaale adress muthbhed ke jokhim ko kam karti he
 Initial designs used a separate section for this purpose, dubbed site-local address
 However, the definition of what constitutes a site remained unclear and a poorly defined detection policy created doubt in routing
 adress range vinirdesh chhod diya gaya or ab nai vyavastha main istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Addresses starting with fe80: - called link-local addresses - are assigned only in the local link area
 prayek network interfes ke liye oparating system ke IP parat dwaara aamtaur par swachaalit rup se adress utpann kiye jate hai
 This provides instant automatic network connectivity for any ipv6 host and means that if multiple hosts connect to a common hub or switch, they get an instant communication route via their link local ipv6 address
 ipv6 network prashasan kii nichali paraton main is suvidha kaa bade paimaane par or adhikansh upyogkartaaon ke liye apratyaksh rup se, istemaal kiya jaataa he 
 No private address prefix can be sent to the public internet
 sabnating kii takanic donon ipv4 or ipv6 network main kaam kar sakati hai
 The IP address is divided into two parts: the network address and the host identifier
 The subnet mask or CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts
 shabd sabanet mask keval ipv4 main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Both IP versions, however, use the concept and notation of classless inter-domain routing
 is main, IP adress ke peeche ek slesh or network bhaag ke liye istemaal kii gai bits kii sankhya, jise maarg upsarg bhi kaha jaataa he, hote he
 For example, an ipv4 address and its subnet mask can be 192
0
2
1 and 255
255
255
0, respectively
 ek hi ypi adress or sabanet mask ke liye CIDR sanketan 192
0
2
1 / 24 he, kyonki ypi pate ke pehle 24 bit network or sabanet sankethik karte he
 When a computer is configured to use the same IP address each time it becomes faster, it is called static IP address
 iske vipareet, un sthitiyon main jab computer ke ypi pate swatah hi niyukt kiye jate hai, use dinemic ypi adress ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Static IP address is assigned to the computer manually by an administrator
 isaki sateek prakriya platform ke anusaar pruthak hoti he
 These are not compatible with dynamic IP addresses, which are specified by either computer interfaces or self-hosted software, such as in Xerconf, or specified by a server using dynamic host configuration protocols
 haalanki DHCP ke upyog se nirdisht ypi adress lambey samay ke liye ek jaise rahete hai, vah aam taur par badal sakate hai
 In some cases, a network administrator may actively implement a specified static IP address
 is maamle main, ek DHCP sarwar kaa upyog hota he, lekin ek vishisht computer ko hameshaa ek hi ypi adress nirdisht karne ke liye, iskaa samanurup vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he
 This allows the static IP address to be primarily configured, not requiring each computer on the network to be specifically configured by a manual system
 static yaa statephul adress vinyas ke abhaav yaa vifaltaa main, ek parichaalan pranali ek network interphes ko state-les swachaalit-samakriti takanic, jaise xerokonf, ke upyog se ypi adress nirdisht kar sakati he
 Dynamic IP addresses are most frequently employed by dynamic host configuration protocol servers on lans and broadband networks
 inhen isliye istemaal kiya jaataa he kyunki yah ek network par prayek upkaran ke liye vishisht static adress nirdisht karne ke prashasnic boj se bachaa sakate he
 It also allows multiple devices to interact in a limited address space on a network, but only if some of them are online at a particular time
 In many current desktop operating systems, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default so that a user does not need to manually enter any settings to connect to a network with a DHCP server
 DHCP is not the only technique for specifying dynamic IP addresses
 dyaap or kuch broadband network bindu se bindu protocol kii gatisheel adress visheshtaayen upyog karte hai
 a sticky dynamic IP address or sticky IP cable and DSL is used by the Internet payer to describe a dynamically assigned IP address that often does not change
 pate aamtaur par DHCP protocol ke saath niyukt kiye jate he
 Since modems typically operate for extended periods of time, address leases are often regularized for longer periods and renewed upon expiration
 yadi ek modem band kar diya jaae or adress patte ke agle samaapan se pehle phir se sanchalit kiya jaae, to is baat kii sarvaadhik sambhaavna he ki use vahi IP adress praapt hoga
 The RFC 3330 defines an address block, 169
254
0
0 / 16, to be used exclusively in local-link addressing for ipv4 networks
 ipv6 main, sthitik yaa gatik adress kaaryon kaa upyog karne vaala, prayek interphes fe80:: / 10 sabanet main swatah ek sthaneey-link adress praapt karata he
 These addresses are valid only on the link, such as a local network segment or a point-wise connection to which a host is connected
 ye adress margskshmiya nahin hote or nijee adreson kii tarah internet packet pratibandhan ke strot yaa gantavy nahin ho sakate hai
 When the local-link ipv4 address block was reserved, no standard existed for the address auto-configuration mechanism
 shoonyata bharna, microsoft ne ek karyaanvayan banaaya jise swatah nijee IP adressing kaha gaya
 APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines due to Microsoft's marketability and, thus becoming a de facto standard in the industry
 kai varshon baad, IETF ne is kaaryashiltaa ke liye ek aupchaarik maanak, RFC 3927, sthaneey-link adress ipv4 ke sakriy vinyas kaa adhikari paribhaashit kiya
 Some infrastructure must use a static address, such as obtaining a host of the domain name system that converts the domain name to an IP address
 kisi interprize main sarwar sthapit karne ke liye sthitik adress suvidhajanak bhi he, parantu bilkul aavashyak nahin
 An address received from a DNS server comes with its own lifetime, or caching time, after which it should be viewed to confirm that it did not change
 yahan tak ki sthitik IP adress bhi network prabandhan ke parinamswaroop badal jaataa he
 According to today, firewalls are common on the Internet
 badi hui network suraksha ke liye, vah graahak ke saarvajanik ypi par aadhaarit nijee network ko abhigam niyantran karte hai
 Using a blacklist or white list, the IP address that is blocked is the client's stated public IP address, meaning if the client is using a proxy server or NAT, blocking an IP address can cause many different people Can be blocked
 IP adress prayog karne ke liye ekaadhik graahak upkaran pradarshit ho sakate hai: yaa to isliye kyonki vah ek saajhe hosting web sarwar vaataavaran kaa hissaa hai yaa kyonki ek ipv4 network adress anuvadak yaa proxi sarwar apane graahakon kii ore se ek madhyasth ke rup main kaam karata he, is avasthaa main, asli utpann IP adress ek anurodh praapt kar rahe sarwar se chhipe ho sakate he
 a common practice is for NAT to hide a large number of IP addresses in a private network
 NAT ke keval "bahari" interphes ko internet ruteble adress kii aavashkata he
 The most common net devices map TCP or UDP port numbers on the outside and individual private addresses on the inside
 jaise ek telephone number kaa site-vishesh vistaaran ho saktaa hai, port sankhya IP adress ke liye ek site-vishesh vistaaran hai
 In small home networks, NAT functions typically take place in a residential gateway device, typically sold as a "router"
 is paridrishy main, router se jude computer ke paas 'nijee' IP adress hoga or router ke paas internet ke saath samvaad karne ke liye ek shaskeey adress hoga
 This type of router allows multiple computers to share a public IP address
 vindos main cmand line saadhan ipconfig kaa upyog kar ke ai pi pataa nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The command line ifconfig in Unix performs this function

 bhagwaan parswanath jain dharm ke teiswein tirthankar hai
 According to Jain texts, the descending part of the present-day Kaal Chakra, Avasarpini is dynamic and 24 Tirthankaras were born in its fourth era
 tirthankar parswanath kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 3 hajaar varsh purv varanasi main hua tha
 In Varanasi there was an Ikshvakuvanshi king named Ashwaseen
 unki rani vama ne pus krishna ekadshi ke din mahatejasvi putr ko janm diya, jiske sharir par sarpchihm tha
 Vama Devi had seen a snake in her dream once in the womb, so the son was named 'parshva'
 unka praarambhik jivan rajkumaar ke rup main vyateet hua
 One day Parshvan saw from his palace that the Poorvasi are going to the other side for the worship material
 vahaan jaakar unhone dekha ki ek tapasvi jahaan panchagni jala rahaa he, or agni main ek sarp kaa joda mar rahaa he, tab parshv ne kaha— 'dayaahin' dharm kisi kaam kaa nahin'
 Tirthankara Parshvanath had left home at the age of thirty and had taken Jaineshwari initiation and Brahmachari was unmarried
 kaashi main 83 din kii kathor tapasya karne ke baad 84wein din unhen keval gyaan praapt hua tha
 He traveled to many countries like Pundra, Tamralipta etc
 tamralipt main unke shishy hue
 Parshvanath established the Chaturvidhi Sangha, which consists of sages, aryika, shravaka, and shravika and even today the Jain society is in this form
 prayek gana ek ganadhar ke antargat kaary karata tha
 All followers, women or men, were all considered equal
 sarnath jain-aagam granthon main singhpur ke naam se prasiddh he
 It was here that Shreyansanathji, the 11th Tirthankara of Jainism was born and propagated his non-violence religion
 keval gyaan ke pashchaat tirthankar parshavnath ne jain dharm ke paanch mukhya vrath – satya, ahimsa, astey, aparigrah or brahmacharya kii shiksha di thi
 Finally, knowing his Nirvana period was near, Shree Sammed went to Shikharji where Shravan Shukla Ashtami attained salvation
 bhagwaan parswanath kii lokvyapaktaa kaa sabase bada pramaan yah he ki aaj bhi sabhi tirthankarasn kii murtiyon or chihnon main parswanath kaa chihn sabase zyada he
 Even today many miraculous statues of Parshvanath are entwined throughout the country
 jinaki gaatha aaj bhi puraane log sunaate hai
 It is believed that most of the ancestors of Mahatma Buddha were also followers of Parshvanath religion
 
 The Jain texts describe the Tirthankara Parshvanatha for nine previous births
 pehle janm main brahman, duusare main hathi, tisare main swarg ke devtaa, chauthe main raja, paanchaven main dev, chhathwein janm main chakravarti samraat or saatven janm main devtaa, aath main raja or nauven janm main raja indra tatpashchaat dasven janm main unhen tirthankar banane kaa saubhaahgya praapt hua
 As a result of the accumulated virtues of previous lives and the tenacity of the tenth birth, they become Tirthankaras

 vaigyanik mod main, on-screen sankhyatmak keepad main a se lekar f tak hexadesimal ank shaamil hote hai jo "hex" kaa chayan karne par sakriy ho jate hai
 In hex mode, however, the Windows calculator only supports integers
 jaisaa ki anya sankhyatmak pranaaliyon ke saath hota he, hexadesimal pranali kaa istemaal parimey sankhyaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki aavarti ank aam hote hai kyonki solah main keval ek ekal abhajya gunankhand hota he: Where an overline indicates a recurring pattern

 chunki mulank 16, ek purna varg he, isliye hexadesimal main vyakt gunan khand kii visham avadhi, aksar dashamalav main vyakt gunan khandon se kahin adhik hoti he or koi chakree sankhya nahin hoti he
 Recurring digits are displayed when the denominator of the lowest terms has a prime factorization not found in the radix; Thus, when using hexadecimal notation, all multiplication clauses with a denominator that are not powers of two are converted into an infinite string of recurring digits
 yah tarksangat sankhyaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye hexadesimal ko dashamalav kii tulana main kam suvidhajanak banaata he kyonki ek bahut bada bhaag parimit pradarshan kii seemaa ke baahar hi rah jaataa he
 All rational numbers that are finitely displayed in hexadecimal are also finitely representable in decimal, duodecimal, and hexadecimal: that is, any hexadecimal number with a finite number of digits has a finite number of digits when it is assigned to those other values
 Is expressed in iske vipareet, keval baad vaale mulaankon main parimit taur par pradarshneey hone vaala ek gunan khand, hexadesimal main parimit taur par pradarshneey hota he
 For example, an infinite recurring display in decimal 0
1 hexadecimal matches 0
1 xxrep 11 9 xxrep 4 
 haalanki, hexadesimal, har main do ke ghaat ke saath gunan khandon ko pradarshit karne ke liye 12 or 60 mulaankon se adhik kushal hota he 
 Perhaps it is easier to show the most widely used power, the power of two, using base 16
 do ke pehle solah ghaaton ko neeche dikhaaya gaya he
 Since the square of four is sixteen, the power of four has a simple relation: do or chaar kaa istemaal karte samay yah tetration ko or zyada aasaan bhi bana detaa he
 32 = 24 = 10 hex, 42 = 216 = 1 xxrep 4 0 hex and 52 = 265536 = hex
