 It is known as the d'arsonval movement and is used in today's analog meters
 vyaavhaarik taur par voltmetre ameter kii tarah hi kaam karte hai, jo voltage ko maapne ke saath, vidyut dhara or pratirodh ko bhi maapte hai
 The voltmeter has two ends
 jin do binduon ke bich vibhavaantar maapna hota he, un par in terminlon ko jod diya diya jaataa he
 The resistance between the two ends of the voltmeter must be very high
 kisi dharamapi ko voltmetre main badalane ke liye uske shreneekram main bahut bade maan kaa pratirodh jodna padataa he
 Similarly, to increase the range of a voltmeet, a large resistance has to be added to its range

 Again the power of God cannot be proved by any proof
 Either God is not free and omnipotent, or he is not benevolent and merciful, otherwise why would he create this world full of sorrow, mourning, Vaishmayadi? If God is governed by karmic theory, then it is not free and if not following the principle of karmic theory, creationism cannot be proved

 "is pad se yah arth boddhavy he", yah ishwar-sanket pad-shakti he
 Numerically- according to the neorealists, the result of a duality does not arise from the magnitude of its constituent two molecules, but from the number of two molecules
 sankhya kaa pratyay chetan drashtaa se sambaddh he, sristi ke samay jeevatmayen jad dravya rup main sthit hai evam adrusht, parmaanu, kaal, dik, man aadi sab jad hai
 Therefore, the power of conscious God is necessary for the suffix of two numbers
 adrushtaata- adrusht jeevon ke shubhashubh karmsanskaron kaa aagaar he
 These accumulated rites are fruitful and are created for the purpose of making people enjoy the fruits of their work

 Therefore, the authority of the omniscient God is proved as the operator of the unseen

 ishwar ke paksh main jitne prabal tark diye ja sakate hai utane hi prabal tark unke vipaksh main bhi diye ja sakate hai

 UTI AMC is India's oldest mutual fund company
 mutual fund me ek fund prabandhak hota he jo fund ke niveshon ko nirdhaarit karata he or laabh or haani kaa hisaab rakhata he
 In this way the profit and loss are shared among the investors
 stock bazaar kii paryaapt jaankaree na hone par bhi nivesh kii ichha rakhane waalon ke liye ek sulabh maarg mutual fund hota he
 The mutual fund operator collects the investment amount of all the investors and also charges some convenience fees from them
 phir is raashi ko unke liye bazaar main nivesh karti he
 The advantage of investing in these is that the investor does not have to worry about when you buy or sell the shares, because this is the concern of the fund manager
 vahi niveshak ke nivesh kaa rakrakhaav karne vaala hota he
 Another benefit is that small investors can invest up to a small amount of Rs 100 per month
 aise main unhen systemetic investment plan lenaa hota he, jisamen bank se ye raashi masik sidhe fund main sthanantarit hoti rahati he

 Mutual fund equity schemes offer a range of options such as index funds, diversified funds, large-cap funds, mid-cap schemes and tax-avoidance schemes
 niveshak nivesh ke uddeshyon or lakshya par sahi baithne vaali yojana chun sakate hai
 Investors who do not want to call for a particular share can invest in an index-based scheme, that is, because the index scheme invests only in those particular shares which are part of a particular index
 yadi index upar jaataa he to niveshak phaayde main rahete hai
 It is also called diversified scheme
 yadi kisi vishesh sector yaa economi ke kisi ek segment main nivesh ko lekar nahin rahanaa chaahate to diaversyphoid skim kaa vikalp uplabdh hota he
 According to the unit issuance, there are two types - units can be issued or paid at any time during the lifetime of an open ended fund scheme
 close anded fund bonus yaa rhite nirgam ko chhodkar yojana ke antargat koi bhi nayaa unit jari nahin kar sakate hai
 For this reason, the unit capital of an open ended scheme can fluctuate in the same way as a share, whereas in the case of close ended it does not
 open anded yojana main kabhi bhi pravesh liya ja saktaa he yaa usase baahar niklaa ja saktaa he or kai baar inamen ek lock-in period hota he, jiske andar reedenpshan nahin ho saktaa, isaliye inamen pravesh ke samay hi nishcint ho janaa chaiye
 Subscriptions can be availed only once in a closed ended scheme and redemption can also be done at minimum fixed time limit intervals
 is tarah close anded skim kii taralata kam ho jaati he
 People with high risk appetite can opt for small or mid cap schemes
 yah skim acchhee sambhaavnaaon vaali choti or majholi companiyon main nivesh karti hai
 They have a higher risk but have the potential to provide higher returns
 share bazaar main lambii avadhi kaa nivesh labhadaayak hota he or alpavadhi nivesh karne waalon ke liye jokhim adhik hota he
 Investments in large cap mutual funds are made in the stock of a bluechip company

 Balanced funds are called hybrid funds
 yah kaaman stock, praverd stock, band or alpavadhi band hota he
 These funds are beneficial, as they also reduce the risk factor and to a large extent ensure the safety of capital
 growth fund kii sahaayta se adhiktam phayda praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 Investments in these are made in companies that make rapid progress in the market
 in funds main nivesh adhik laabh ke liye karte hai or is kaaran se jokhim adhik hota he
 These are funds that give priority to security
 inamen apekshaakrit kam laabh hota he, kintu haani kii sambhaavna bahut kam hoti he
 Money markets are generally considered the safest funds

 Mutual funds are formed as a trust under the sponsor, trustee, asset management company and custodian

 The AMC has the power of general supervision and control over the trustees
 ve fund ke kaary kaa sanchaalan karte hai or sebi ke niyamon kaa paalan ho, yah dekhte hai
 According to SEBI rules, two-thirds of the directors of the trustee company or board of trustees should be independent so that they do not associate with the sponsor
 iske alaava eemasi ke 50 pratishat director swatantra hone chahie
 All mutual funds have to obtain SEBI registration before opening any scheme
 bazaar main koi bhi fund house jab koi nai yojana nikaalata he, tab isse jude sabhi niyamon, shart or duusari baton kii jaankaree securities and exange board of india ko anivaary rup se uplabdh karaata he
 The document by which this information is given to SEBI is called 'offer Document of Scheme'
 isamen investment kaa uddeshy, jokhim kaarak, lod va anya vyay aadi se judi paryaapt jaankariyaan di gai hoti hai
 There are expenditure on various items such as advisory, custodial, audit transfer agent and trustee fees and agent commission in operating a mutual fund, the expenditure in these items is covered in the offer document
 iske alaava, yah bhi bataaya gaya hota he ki skim main nivesh karne par niveshak ko koun-koun se shulk dene honge, jaise entry lod, agsit lod, swimming chajerj, recoring ekspence aadi
 In a scheme where the expenses are less, the fund house will have more money for the investor and this will also give the expectation of higher returns
 aisi yojana niveshkon ke liye adhik laabhadaayak hoti hai
 If more than 65 percent of the amount is to be invested in equity under any scheme, then such scheme is called equity scheme
 yadi company equity va rin main baraabar-baraabar rakam nivesh karne ja rahi he, to aisi yojana balanced skim ke antargat aati he
 Equity schemes are more risky than balanced schemes
 bharat me 2010 tak mutual fund main nivesh hetu bichauliyon kii bhoomika samaapt ho jaayegi
