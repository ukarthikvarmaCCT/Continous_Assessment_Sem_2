 not just by understanding the yield of your narrow intellect, and just by picking it up and serving it on the TV screen 


 it would have made a little sense So the show would be named "radhakrishna" and not "sriradhakrishna" It is known from this that your reverence, loyalty and intention which is clear every time is only to hurt the religious buildings of Hindus

 At such times, perhaps the poet's sensibility is more effective - not only because the experience system is activated on a different wave, but also because of a different kind of recognition and habit of prolific language
 kavi kunwar narayan ke kahani-sangrah aakaaron ke aas-paas kii kahaniyon ko padhakar isliye kuch aisa aswaad miltaa he jo aam taur par aaj kii kahaniyon se sukhad rup main agal he
 In a way, the world of these stories is not a special private world, it also introduces familiar experiences of everyday life itself
 magar unhen dekhne vaali nazar, uske kone or in donon ke kaaran ubharne vaale rup or bhashaai sanghathan kaa fark itnaa bada he ki in kahaniyon kii duniya ekadam vishisht or vismayakari jaan padati he, jisamen kisi-na-kisi parichit sambandh, anubhav yaa rukh kaa yaa to koi antarvirodh yaa nayaa arth khul jaataa he, yaa isaki koi nayi parat ubhar aati he- jaisaa aksar kavita ke bimbon se hua karata he
 It is no wonder that there is a constant movement between reality and fantasy in these stories
 darasal, phantasy or yatharth kii milawat ke alag-alag rup or anupaat se hi in kahaniyon kaa apana alag-alag rang paidaa hota he
 'suspicious Moves' is the deep anguish and compassion of the tension and their weariness arising from the various external pressures in the male-female relationship, a fantasy around the 'I', the woman, the parrotman and the mustache

 'and finally,' the woman was bled on the floor: some Javan had sunken her teeth and claws from place to place on her soft body

 It is not that he does not see the ubiquity, filth, violence, selfishness, slander at every stage of his life, but he puts it in a relaxed lighthearted manner rather than a clichéd aggressive offensive idiom that makes his personal identity of truth noisy Is not lost

 In fact, the big man is the one who is less visible, who cannot distinguish between darkness and light
 ’ ‘chaaku kii dhar’ main bade miyaan apane bete ko ant main naseehat dete hai ki ‘jo chakma khaakar bhi dusron ko chakma dena na sikh sake, kabhi vyapaar nahin kar saktaa

 'simplicity of euphemisms at many levels simultaneously makes these stories so refreshing
 magar in kahaniyon kaa failaav keval aisi pratikatmak saadagi tak hi simit nahin he
 Stories like 'play of dolls' or 'kameez' have deep personal or external problems
 ‘afasar’ main afasariyat kii yantrikta, amanviyata or saadhaaran aadmi kii pahchaan saakaar kii gai he
 'janmati' has a picture of the volatile temperament of the crowd, horror in 'the Second Face', and the cowardly man giving his life to save a child from falling off the train
 ‘aatmahatya’ kaa kathy he : ‘us maanviya samvidhan ko kya kaha jaae jisamen jeene or marane donon kii sambhaavnaayen hon lekin saadhan kii guarantee ek kii bhi na ho
 "he" is the result of the mutual attraction of men and women and the resultant triangles and quadrants formed in it
 yaa phir badi sookshm pratikatmakataa vaali sangrah kii pehle hi kahani ‘aakaaron ke aas-paas’ kahani or kavita ke seemaant par rachi gai lagati he
 In fact, these stories seek to examine, dismantle and define many human moral relations, questions and values on a wide-spread vane, not in a revolutionary posture, but with the intention of irresponsible personal identification of reality

 Their synergy is better in context and in many cases they do not even appear to be Latin
 udahaaran, ye sabhi shabd latin hai: pahaad, tarai, nadi, chachee, chachaa, chalanaa, upyog dhakka or rahanaa 
 English readily accepts technical words and often imports new words and sentences

 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Tweb Hoeffel and Auck, giving a definition of fossilism, wrote: Paleontology is the science that explains the life of past geological ages revealed by the primitive plants and the putrid remains of animals
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki jeevashm vigyaan adikalin jeevajantuon kaa, une ashmibhoot avasheshon ke aadhaar par adhyayan karata he
 The word fossil itself indicates that there is a study of Jiva + Ashram
 angreji kaa Palaentology shabd bhi Palaios = pracheen + Onto = jeev ke adhyayan kaa nirdesh karata he
 The study of paleontology is a new branch of biology and it has developed over the last 200 years

 There are some conditions of vulgarization, due to which the dead bodies of the fauna are vulgarized
 sabhi jeevon kaa ashmikaran na to aavyashyak hi he, na hi sambhav he
 For this reason too, it is difficult to write a series history of the life of the primitive creatures
 ab tak jitne bhi jeevashmiya pramaan hamen praapt ho chuke hai, unke aadhaar par jeevon ke kramik vikaas par acha khaasaa prakaash padataa he
 The study of fossils gives us an idea of the organisms which are now either extinct, or their present form has changed enough
 jeevashm pracheen jeevon ke ve avshesh hai, jo shilakhandon yaa anya sthanon par pathar jaise ho gaye hai
 Some such remains of creatures have also been found, which are in their original form rather than preserved

 Fossils also resemble, in modular form, the shape of modern organisms

 Some animals, whose bodies are made up of inorganic materials such as calcium carbonate, silica, etc
, have relatively little effect on the disorder
 aise jeevon ke jeevashm bahut kam sankhya main uplabdh hai
 Even those that are available are incomplete to compare with modern living organisms
 jeevon kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi he ki ek prakaar ke jeevashm kuch vishesh prakaar ke shilakhandon main hi milte hai
 From these rocks, knowledge of the environment of the entire life of fossils is obtained
 jeevashmon se yah bhi maaloom hota he ki jeev kaise sthaan par rahaa karata tha or kya khaataa-peetaa tha
 They also throw light on the then geographical conditions

 Similarly, solutions to many other problems related to growth have been fossilized
 jeevashm vigyaan kai shakhaon main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 From the convenience point of view, it has now become a rule that when we use the word 'fossilology', we only mean the study of fossils of invertebrates

 Plant fossils are studied under a different branch called phytosemiology

 The field of paleontology is very wide and its limits cannot be determined definitively

 The beginning of fossil scientific investigations can be done from the oldest attainable fossils whose biological properties can be described on biological basis
 jeevashmiki kaa bhoumiki, visheshkar starit-shail-bhoumiki, se ati ghanishtha sambandh he
 Remnants of past living creatures are found in layered rocks
 in shailon ke nirmaan ke vishay main or unka anukram sthapit karne main unamem paae janevaale jeevashm bahut sahaayak siddh hue hai
 Actually layered-shell-geology without fossils is, in a way, practical paleontology
 jeevashmiki kaa jaiviki ke saath ghanishtha sambandh he
 Current biology and plants are studied under biology, while in biology, organisms and plants of geological ages that once lived and are now available only as fossils are studied
 lekin jeevashmiki ko jaiviki kii ek shakha nahin mana ja saktaa he, kyonki jeevashmiki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah kaa dhang jaiviki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah ke dhang se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Determining where fossilology can be separated from biology is often impossible
 parantu mote taur se jeevashm kaa ant or jaiviki kaa prarambh atyant-nutan yug or aadhunik yug ke sandhisthan se le sakate hai
 In this way, there are many and different types of fauna remains found between the indeterminate and suspicious pre-cambrian prehistoric animals and plants and between the present and certain types of organisms and plants, which throw light on the organism
 bhuparpati ke avsaadee shailon main milanevaale ye jeevashm hi, jeevashmiki ke adhyayan ke aadhaar hai
 Biologists are very interested in paleontology because it is closely related to a subject like biology
 praaniyon or padpon kii jatiyon kaa itihaas athwa jativrutt, starit shailon ke anukramit staron se praapt kiye jeevashmon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par adhik vishwaspurvak anurekhit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, due to incomplete record of organisms, the tracing of their genealogies is highly hindered, as only a few of the animals and plants found in the geological ages and most of them in incomplete condition are found reflected in these rocks
 abhilekh kii is apurnataa ke baavjood anek jeevavarg main, jab unka anurekhan shailon ke ek str se duusare str main kiya jaataa he tab, shanai: shanai: parivartan hone lagate hai
 When the patterns of fossils are collected from different indexed levels, the two distinctly visible species are directly related to the interstitial fossils and the fossils of intermediate levels ranging from the lowest found species to the highest
 Changes in the life of animals can be seen
 jeevashmon se jativrutt kaa pataa lagane ke liye, stareey reeti ke atirikt sharir tathaa vyativrutt kii tulanaatmak ritiyon kaa bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence, fossilism confirms the notion that biology developed as a result of changes occurring gradually
 is baat ke bataane kaa bhi pramaan he ki jeev vikaas niyatvikasiya tha
 This is to say that the biologic changes in the class of certain organisms occurred in a certain direction till ages and apart from this, the associated classes which are of the same ancestral origin, without being influenced by each other and external conditions, are similar in their evolution
 Stages or similar states, indicating that the direction of development in the various classes of organisms, By Vj is determined by paternal qualities
 jivit padpon or praaniyon kaa eckoshika andey se le karke antim dasha tak vikaas kii sampurna avasthaaon kaa anurekhan karnaa, bhraumiki or jeevaritti ke antargat aata he
 The evolution of the species of plants and animals of a class is almost the same, at least in its early stages, and the entire embryos within a class have so much homogeneity in one state until another that they cannot be separated
 is tathy ne un aakaaron main atyadhik bandhutav pragat kiya he, jo praudhavastha main ek duusare se atyadhik bhinn hote hai
 The reality of this is seen in vertebrates, whose embryos can be separated from each other with great difficulty in the initial stages and which very slowly bear the characteristic figures of their class or body
 in bhruneey anveshanon ke parinaamon kaa jeevashmiki ke saath vishesh sambandh he
 There are many fossils in the information that show signs of embryonic, or at least, fleshy, or adolescent, compared to modern organisms related to themselves
 isprakaar ke aadim awa bhruneey prakaaron ke udhaaharan kasherukon main vishesh karke dekhne ko milte hai, kyonki inamen kankal jivan ke ati praarambhik kaal hi main ashmibhoot ho jate hai
 Therefore, the late stages of modern organisms can be directly compared with adult fossils
 jeevashmon ko nishchit naam dena jeevashm vigyaani ke liye isliye mahatv kaa he ki jeevashmon main vah adhik yatharth vibhed kar sake
 The nomenclature of fossils is generally based on the same principles on which creatures
 pranijagat anek sanghon main vibhakt he or prayek sangh anek virgon, ganon, kulon, vanshon or jatiyon main vibhakt he
 There are many types of fossils
 yadi anveshak kisi jati ke jeevashm ke ek praturup ke aadhaar par us sampurna jati kaa varnan karata he, to vah jeevashm praturup us jati kaa naam praroop kehalaata he
 If the investigator takes the help of other fossil specimens to determine the name of one, these additional specimens are called paratypes
 yadi anveshak bina namprarup kaa nishchay kiye hi kai anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in jeevashm namoonon ko sahpraroop kehete hai
 If the fossil form of a caste is chosen after the initial description of that caste, then the fossil type is called the lectotype
 jis prakaar ek jati ke varnan ke liye jeevashm namoonay hote hai usee prakaar ek vansh ke varnan ke liye praroop jati athwa samajini jeevashm hote hai
 If an investigator describes a new lineage based on a particular race, then that caste becomes a genholotype for that lineage
 yadi anveshak nae vansh ke varnan main aisi jatiyon kii suchi de detaa he jinako vah yah samajhataa he ki ve nae vansh ke antargat aate hai, to in sab jatiyon ko jenocentip kehete hai
 Many of the genosyntypes can be sorted later by the ADI investigator or later by another investigator

 The study of the development of the horse is a good example for rendering biologic theory
 vah sampurna saamagree jis par ghode ke vikaas kaa itihaas aadhaarit he, uttari america ke tritiyak shailon se praapt kii gai he
 The main directions of its development are: aakaar main vruddhi, gati main vruddhi, sir or greeva main vruddhi
 The oldest fossil of the horse is the Eohypus, which has been found in the lower Eocene rocks and was in shape from cat to fox
 madhya iosin kaa ghoda orohipus ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo aakaar main iohipus se kuch hi bada tha
 Answer: The horse of the Eocene is called Ephippus, the subject of which is not fully known
 mesohipus ke naam se prachlit ghoda, nimnatar or madhya oligosin shailon main miltaa he
 It was equal to, or somewhat smaller than, a lamb in size
 myohipus, jo uttar oligosin or nimnatar myosin yug main paaya jaataa tha, bhed se kuch hi bade aakaar kaa tha
 Parahippus was very abundant in the lower Myocene age
 madhya myosin kaa ghoda, mericups kehalaata tha
 Which was similar to Parahippus itself
 plyosin yug kaa ghoda, plyohipus aakaar main gadhe ke baraabar tha, par tritiyak yug main milanevaala ghada vartmaan kaal main paae janevaale ghode ke baraabar tha
 Thus we see that the size of the horse increased gradually
 isi prakaar ghode kii bahu or padon kii aantarik rachana main parivartan se uski gati main vruddhi hui
 The main symptom of this change was the degeneration of the lateral parts and the expansion and enlargement of the central or axial part, so that it could bear the burden with firmness while running
