 inke samvidhan kaa utana adhik vikaas nahin hua jitna anya ganraajyon kaa
 They were often livelihoods or looters
 inamen bhi jo kuch viksit the unhen pug or jo pichde hue the unhen braat kaha jaataa tha
 a third bunch of sanghas or ganas had expanded into Saurashtra
 unamem andhakavrishniyon kaa sangh yaa ganraajya bahut prasiddh tha
 Krishna was a member of this union and hence in the peace, he has been called Ardhbokta Rajjanya
 gyaat hota he ki sindhu nadi ke donon taton par ganraajyon kii yah shrinkhalaa upar se neeche ko utarati saurashtra tak fail gai thi kyonki sindh naamak pradesh main bhi is prakar ke kai ganon kaa varnan miltaa he
 Among them were Muchakarna, Brahmanak and Shudraka
 bhartiya ganshasan ke sambandh main bhi paryaapt saamagree uplabdh he
 The unit of construction of Gan was total
 prayek kul kaa ek ek vyakti gansabha kaa sadsy hota tha
 He was called gotra according to Kulvriddha or Panini
 usee kii sangya vanshya bhi thi
 Often they were people of Rajni or Kshatriya caste
 aise kulon kii sankhya prayek gana main parampara se niyat thi, jaise lichchhavigan ke sanghathan main 7707 kutumb yaa kul sammilit the
 Each of their clans had a federal title of king
 sabhaparv main ganadhin or rajadheen shashan kaa vivechan karte hue spasht kaha he ki samrajya shashan main satta ek vyakti ke haath main rahati he
 But in Gana rule, each family has a king
 
 Apart from this, two more things have been said
 ek yah ki ganshasan main praja kaa kalyaan dur dur tak vyaapt hota he
 Secondly, the condition of war is not safe due to war
 ganon ke liye sham yaa shanti kii niti hi thi
 It has also been said that in Gana, there is also appreciation of Pranubhav or the dignity of the other person and the person who walks with everyone in Gana is praiseworthy
 gana shashan ke liye hi parameshthy yah paribhaashik sangya bhi prayukt hoti thi
 Perhaps it was considered necessary that there should be organization of parties within the gana
 dal ke sadasyon ko vagrya, pakshya, grihy bhi kehete the
 The leader of the party was called Paramavagriya
 gansabha main gana ke samast pratinidhiyon ko sammilit hone kaa adhikaar tha kintu sadasyon kii sankhya kai sahasr tak hoti thi atev vishesh avasaron ko chhodkar praaia: upasthiti parimit hi rahati thi
 Intimate officers were appointed for governance
 kintu niyamanirmaan kaa puraa daayitv gansabha par hi tha
 The motion was proposed in the assembly as per rules
 uski teen vaachana hoti thi or shalakaon dwaara matdaan kiya jaataa tha
 Apart from political questions, many other types of social, practical and religious questions also used to come for consideration in this meeting
 us samay kii rajya sabhaaon kii praaia: aise hi lacheelee paddati thi
 There is a history of fluctuations of republics in India for almost a thousand years
 unki antim jhalak gupt samrajya ke udai kaal tak dikhaai padati he
 The republics were merged by Samudragupta's military expedition aimed at the Tranabandhi
 arvachin puraatatv ke utkhanan main ganraajyon ke kuch lekh, sikke or mitti kii mohren praapt hui hai
 In particular, some authentic material has been found regarding the victorious Yudayya Republic

 Further, his form changed into category, category, poo and life etc
 ganatantratmak or rajtantratmak paramparaon kaa sangharsh jari rahaa
 The republics continued to change in the Kingdom of Nripe and Republic of Nripe Kingdom
 aitarey brahman ke uttarkul or uttaramdra naamak ve rajya xxrep 4 - jo himalay ke paar chale gaye the xxrep 5 - punjab main kuru or madra naamak rajtantrvaadiyon ke rup main rahete the
 Later, they became republican like Madra and Kuru and Shiva, Panchal, Malla and Videha like them
 mahabharat yug main andhakavrishniyon kaa sangh ganatantratmak tha
 Able to take part in the rivalry of the empires, his head Krishna began turning the politics of Mahabharata
 panini ke samay sara vahik desh ganraajyon se bharaa tha
 Mahavir and Buddha not only immortalized the knowledgeable beings and the Shakas, but also changed the body of Indian history
 unke samay main uttar purvi bharat ganraajyon kaa pradhan kshetra tha or lichhavi, videh, shakya, mall, coliya, moriy, buli or bhagg unke mukhya pratinidhi the
 The Lichchhavis became the pillars of the rising kingdom of Magadha with their power and prestige
 par ve apni raksha main peeche na rahe or kabhi to mallon ke saath tathaa kabhi aas paas ke anyaanya ganon ke saath unhone sangh banaaya jo bajjisang ke naam se vikhyath hua
 Ajatashatru sent his minister Varshakar and sought to know from Buddha the way to win him
 mantri ko, buddha ne anand ko sambodhit kar apratyaksh uttar diya xxrep 5 - anand! jab tak vajgiyon ke adhiveshan ek par ek or sadasyon kii prachur upasthiti main hote hai; jab tak ve adhiveshnon main ek man se baithte, ek man se uthte or ek man se sanghakaarya sampann karte hai; jab tak ve purvapratishthit vyavastha ke virodh main niyamanirmaan nahin karte, purvaniyamit niyamon ke virodh main navaniyamon kii abhisrishti nahin karte or jab tak ve ateet kaal main prasthaapit vajgiyon kii sansthaaon or unke siddhanton ke anusaar kaary karte hai; jab tak ve vajji arhaton or guru janon kaa sanman karte hai, unki mantranaa ko bhakthipurvak sunate hai; jab tak unki naariyaan or kanyaayein shakti or apchaar se vyavastha viruddh vyasan kaa saadhan nahin banaai jaatin, jab tak ve vajjichaityon ke prati shraddha or bhakthi rakhte hai, jab tak ve apane arhaton kii raksha karte hai, us samay tak he anand, vajgiyon kaa utkarsh nishchit he, apakarsh sambhav nahin
 Buddha also made similar rules for his Buddhist Sangha established on the ideal of the Gana or Sangha
 jab tak ganraajyon ne un niyamon kaa paalan kiya, ve bane rahe, par dhire dhire unhone bhi raaj kii oopaadhi apnaani sharu kar di or unki aapasi foot, kisi kii jyeshthata, madhyataa tathaa shishyatv na sweekaar karnaa, unke dosha ho gaye
 The federations started fighting among themselves and became monarchies
 tathaapi ganatantron kii parampara kaa abhi naash nahin hua
 From Punjab and Sindh to eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, their status continued throughout the state
 chauthi sadi isvi purv main makduniyaan ke samrajyavaadee akramanakar sikandar ko, apane vijay main ek ek inch jameen ke liye keval ladanaa hi nahin padaa, kabhi kabhi chhadam or vishwasghaat kaa bhi aashray lenaa padaa
 The Greek historians did not fail to describe the bravery, militancy, patriotism, patriotism and enthusiasm of the Punjabi people
 apane desh ke ganraajyon se unki tulana or unke shashantantron ke bhedopabhed unhone samaj bujhakar kiye
 The Narnaris of many Ganas like Kath, Askaq, Yodayya, Malava, Chudraka, Agrashreni Kshatriya, Soubhuti, Muchukarna and Ambastha etc
 turned Alexander's teeth and turned the earth with their blood to protect the motherland
 kathon or saubhootiyon kaa saundayprem ativaadee tha or swasth tathaa sudanr bachche hi jeene die jate the
 The child belongs to the state and not to the parents
 sabhi naagarik sipaahi hote or anekanek ganraajya aayudhjivi
 But all was in vain, due to his policy of loneliness
 unamem mataiky kaa abhaav or unke chote chote pradesh unke vinaash ke kaaran bane
 While Alexander won him, Chandragupta, a representative of one of the same republics and his minister Chanakya, adopted a policy of abolition
 parantu samrajyavad kii dhara main samahit ho jane kii baari keval unheen ganraajyon kii thi jo chote or kamjor the
 Kul Sangh also appeared to Chandragupta and Chanakya as evil
 yah ganraajyon ke sanghatmak swaroop kii vijay thi
 But these associations were exceptions
 ajatshatru or varshkaar ne jo niti apanaai thi, vahiin chandragupta or chanakya kaa adarsh bani
 The totalitarian form of the imperialist powers emerged and most of the republics merged under the vast unitary rule of the Mauryas
 parantu ganraajyon kii aatma nahin dabi
 Alexander's sword, Mauryan kills or invasive floods of Bakhtis and Shaka Kushans could only weaken the weak among them
 apni swatantraaa kaa har mulya chukaane ko taiyaar malloi, yodhey, madra or shivi punjab se neeche utarkar raajapootaana main pravesh kar gaye or shatabdiyon tak aage bhi unke ganraajya bane rahe
 They abandoned their ancient cities like Shakal and settled in new cities like Madhyamika and Ujjayini, drove their coins and conquered their Ganas
 maalav ganatantr ke pramukh vikramaditya ne shakon se morcha liya, unpar vijay praapt kii, shakari oopaadhi dhaaran kii or smritiswaroop 57-56 i0 pus0 main ek nayaa sanwat chalaaya jo kramash:kritamaalav or vikram sanwat ke naam se prasiddh hua or jo aaj bhi bhartiya gananaapaddati main mukhya sthaan rakhata he
 However, this was only the last flame of freedom
 gupton ke samrajyavad ne un sabko samaapt kar daalaa
 Dhuitra Samudragupta, one of the headmasters of the Indian Ganas - the Lichchhavis - erased his name and forced the Malavas, Arjunayanas, Yudhyayas, Kakas, Kharpariks, Abhiras, Prajuns and Sunkaniks, etc
 to salute, arrive and obey
 unhone swayan apane ko maharaj kahana shuru kar diya or vikramaditya oopaadhidhari chandragupta ne un sabko apane vishaal samrajya kaa shasit pradesh bana liya
 It was ironic in the fate of the Indian republics that their relatives attacked them the greatest xxrep 4 - They were Vaidehiputra Ajatasutra Maurya prince Chandragupta Maurya, Lichchavidauhitra Samudragupta

 Like ancient India, the tradition of Greece was very ancient
 dorian kabeelon ne igian sagar ke tat par 12 veen sadi i

 Gradually republican cities stood up all over Greece
 athens, sparta, korinth aadi anek nagarrajya doria greek awaason kii qatari main khadey ho gaye
 They built their traditions, constitutions and ideals, many forms of democratic governance emerged
 praptiyon ke uplakshyaswaroop kirtistambh khadey kiye gaye or aishwaryapurna sabhyataaon kaa nirmaan shuru ho gaya
 But in his republics, the seeds of his downfall also remained hidden
 unke aishwarya ne unki sabhyataa ko bhogavaadi bana diya, sparta or athens kii laag daat or parsparik sangharsh prarambh ho gaye or ve adarsh rajya--republic--swayan samrajyavaadee hone lage
 The so-called freedom remained in them, political rights remained in the hands of very limited people, the majority of the people were far away from political rights, did not even have civil rights and the system of servants and slaves proved to be a satire on those independent towns
 swaarth or aapasi foot badhane lagi
 Even when they fought among themselves, the kingdoms of Iran and the Macedonia broke up on them
 sikandar ke bhartiya ganraajyon kii qamar todane ke purv use pita philip ne greek ganraajyon ko samaapt kar diya tha
 The imperialism countered the municipalities of both countries
 parantu pashchim main ganraajyon kii parampara samaapt nahin hui
 Rome city of Italy became their center and later the origin of the very famous Roman race
 hanibal ne usapar dhaave kiye or laga ki rome kaa ganraajya chur chur ho jaayga par us asaadhaaran vijeta ko bhi jama kii ladaai harkar apni raksha ke liye hatana padaa
 The conquering army of Rome raided from Greece to England
 par jaisaa greece main hua, vaisaa hi rome main bhi
 The Romanians who conquered Greece in the military wars were defeated in the battle of civilization and culture, and Greece's indulgence flourished in Rome
 abhijaat kulon ke laadle bhrashtachar main duube, janavaadee paaharu bane or use samoochaa nigal gaye---panpei, sijar, antoni sabhi
 They began to drown in the subtlety, luster and aroma of Indian muslin, pearls and spices, and despite the screams of historians like Pliny, the gold of Rome came from the western ports of India
 rome kii ganraajyavaadee parampara sukh, saundarya or vaibhav kii khoj main lupt ho gai or unke shmashaan par samrajya ne mahal khadaa kiya
 Augustus became his first emperor and his descendants undertook to submerge all of Europe in their imperialist civilization
 par uski bhi ridh un hunon ne tod di, jinaki ek shakha ne bharat ke shaktishaalee gupt samrajya ko jhakazorkar dharashayi kar dene main anya patanonmukh pravritiyon kaa saath diya
 However, in spite of the newly rising kingdoms and feudal rule, the republics of Europe were reintroduced through charters and guilds
 nagaron or saamanton main, nagaron or samraaton main gajab kii kashmakash hui or sadiyon bani rahi; par antat: nagar vijayi hue
 The feudatories and emperors of their charters had to be accepted
 madhyakaal main italy main ganraajya uth khadey hue, jinamein prasiddh the genoa, florence, padua evam venice or unke sangrakshak tathaa netaa the unke duk
 But they also ended with the rise of national ancestry
 netherlands ke saat rajyon ne speni samrajya ke viru ddh vidroh kar sanyukt netherlands ke ganraajya kii sthapana kii
 Even further, republican sentiments were not abolished
 england anuvanshik nriprajya tha, tathaapi madhyayug main vah kabhi kabhi apane ko kamanbil athwa kamanwealth naam se pukaarata rahaa
 In the 18th century, the citizens there killed their king to protect their rights and the Commonwealth or Republic was established
 pun: rajtantr aayaa par ganatantratmak bhavanaayen jari raheen, raja janata kaa kripapaatr, khilonaa ban gaya or kabhi bhi uski aseemit shakti sthapit na ho saki
 The battle of human officers continued and the English colonies of America won the war against England and included those rights in their declaration of independence
 france kii praja bhi aage badi; ekta, swatantraaa or bandhutav ke naare lage, rajtantr dhah gaya or kranti ke falswaroop prajatantr kii sthapana hui
 Napoleon swam on the flood of those feelings, France itself was once again in the grip of an autocratic monarchy for a few days, but the other countries of Europe and beyond also rose a sea of independent feelings
 19veen sadi ke madhya se krantiyon kaa yug pun: prarambh hua or koi bhi desh unase achoota na bachaa
 Monarchies were abolished and republics were established
 parantu 19veen tathaa 20veen sadiyon main europe ke ve hi desh, jo apni simaaon ke bheetar janavaadee hone kaa dam bharte rahe, bahari duniyaan main xxrep 4 - asia or africa main xxrep 4 - samrajyavad kaa nagn tandav karne se na chuke
 Influenced by Marxism in 1917, there was a state revolution in Russia and the Tsarist was abolished
 1948 i

 Both these countries call themselves republics, and their governance is done in the name of the people
 parantu unamem janawaad kii dori khinchnewale haath adhinayakawadi hi hai
 By breaking centuries of slavery, India too is determined to carry on the tradition of the Republic and has created a democratic constitutional system for itself
 samrajyon or samraaton ke namonishaan mit chuke hai tathaa nirkunsh or aseemit rajyavyavasthaayen samaapt ho chuki hai, kintu swatantraaa kii vah mul bhaavana maanavhruday se nahin dur kii ja sakati jo ganraajya parampara kii kunjee he
 Today's republics like the ancient era of world history are neither very small in the region nor suffer from divisions and hostility
 unamem na to pracheen greece kaa dasavaad he or na pracheen or madhyakaalin bharat or europe ke ganraajyon kaa simit matdaan
 The entire public has now become the chief among them and it is the legislature of its fate
 sainik adhinayakawadi bhi vivash hokar janawaad kaa dam bharte or kabhi kabhi uske liye kaary bhi karte hai
 The spirit of the Republic is immortal and its democracy will always be immortal

 nakodaa bhairav apane chamatkaari shaktiyon athwa bhakton kii muraadein puri karne or unki raksha karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Many Jain Nakodas are unaffected by Bhairav's popularity and believe that it has nothing to do with Jainism

 This Dorset race did not survive the spread of the thuels and became extinct
 doreseton kaa varnan aadhunik inuit mithy-kathaon main miltaa he, jisamen unhen ek 'bhimkaay' yaa 'daanveey' jati kaha jaataa he
 From this, historians speculate that the Dorset people must have been bigger than the Thule in stature

 isamen kul - 52 varna hote hai
 Example - found in Rigveda ati pracheen kaal se hi chikitsa ke do pramukh vibhaag chale aa rahe hai - kaaychikitsa evam shalyachikitsa 
 On this basis, two traditions also run among physicians
 ek kaaychikitsak or doosraa shalyachikitsak 
 Although both of them have more or less general importance of drug treatment, the importance of a physician's handwriting in surgery is of major importance, whereas the main form of medicine is medicine
 ayurveda main bhi dhanvantari sampradaay, yaa sushrut sampradaay, shalyachikitsa ke pratik hai jabaki aatreya sampradaay yaa charak sampradaay kaaychikitsa ke pratik hai

 Surgical surgery is also a gift of the present era
 samskruti kisi samaaj main gaharaai tak vyaapt gunon ke samgr rup kaa naam he, jo us samaaj ke sochane, vichaarne, kaary karne, khaane-pine, bolne, nrity, gayan, sahitya, kala, vaastu aadi main parilakshith hoti he
 The present form of culture is the result of the long-term practices of a society
 ‘samskruti’ shabd sanskrit bhashaa kii dhaatu ‘kri’ se bana he
 Three words are formed from this metal, 'nature', 'culture' and 'perversion'
 jab ‘prakrut’ yaa kaccha maal parishkrut kiya jaataa he to yah sanskrit ho jaataa he or jab yah bighad jaataa he to ‘vikrut’ ho jaataa he
 In English, the word 'culture' is used for culture which is derived from the Latin language 'cult or cultus', which means to cultivate, develop or refine and worship
 sankshep main, kisi vastu ko yahan tak sanskaarit or parishkrut karnaa ki iskaa antim utpaada hamaari prashansa or sammaan praapt kar sake
 This is similar to the Sanskrit word 'culture'
 samskruti kaa shabdaarth he - uttam yaa sudhari hui sthiti
 Man is by nature a progressive being
 yah buddhi ke prayog se apane chaaron ore kii prakritik paristhiti ko nirantar sudharta or unnat karata rahata he
 Every such way of living, customs, living, living ethics, new research and inventions, by which man rises and becomes civilized from the status of animals and wilderness, is a part of civilization and culture
 sabhyataa se manushya ke bhautik kshetra kii pragati suchit hoti he jabaki samskruti se maansik kshetra kii pragati suchit hoti he
 Man does not become content only by improving physical conditions
 vah bhojan se hi nahin jeeta, sharir ke saath man or aatma bhi he
 Physical progress can erase the hunger of the body, but in spite of this the mind and soul remain unquenchable
 inhen santusht karne ke liye manushya apana jo vikaas or unnati karata he, use samskruti kehete hai
 Religion and philosophy are the result of human curiosity
 soundarya kii khoj karte hue vah sangeet, sahitya, murti, chitra or vaastu aadi anek kalaon ko unnat karata he
 Creates social and political associations for a comfortable residence
 is prakaar maansik kshetra main unnati kii suchak uski prayek samyak kriti samskruti kaa ang banati he
 These mainly include religion, philosophy, all the knowledge-sciences and arts, social and political institutions and practices
 samskruti jivan kii vidhi he
 The food we eat, the clothes we wear, the language we speak and the God we worship are all civilizations; However, they also inform culture
 saral shabdon me ham kah sakate hai ki samskruti us vidhi kaa pratik he jiske aadhaar par ham sochate hai; or kaary karte hai
 It also includes the intangible / non-material expressions and thoughts that we get in succession as members of a family and society
 ek saamaajik varg ke sadsy ke rup main maanvon kii sabhi uplabdhiyaan uski samskruti se prerit kahi ja sakati hai
 Art, music, literature, architecture, craftsmanship, philosophy, religion and science are all manifest aspects of culture
 tathaapi samskruti main ritirivaaj, paramparaayen, parv, jeene ke tareeke, or jivan ke vibhinn pakshon par vyakti vishesh kaa apana drushtikon bhi sammilit hai
 In this way culture relates to the human-born mental environment in which all non-material products are supplied from one generation to the next
 samaaj-vaigyanikon main ek saamaanya sahmati he ki samskruti main manushyon dwaara praapt sabhi aantarik or bahya vyavhaaron ke tareeke samahit hai
 They can also be transferred by symbols; Which includes specific achievements of human groups
 inhen shilpaklakritiyon dwaara moort rup pradaan kiya jaataa he
 In fact, the basic focus of culture lies in the subtle ideas that have historically been understood in a group, along with the values attached to them
 samskruti kisi samaaj ke ve sookshm sanskaar hai, jinke madhyam se log paraspar sampreshan karte hai, vichaar karte hai or jivan ke vishay main apni abhivrittiyon or gyaan ko disha dete hai
 Culture is an expression of our innermost nature in our way of living and thinking
 yah hamaare sahitya main, dharmik kaaryon main, manoranjan or anand praapt karne ke tareekon main bhi dekhi ja sakati hai
 There are two different sub-departments of culture - physical and non-physical
 bhautik samskruti un vishyon se judi he jo hamaari sabhyataa kehete hai, or hamaare jivan ke bhautik pakshon se sambaddh hote hai, jaise hamaari veshbhusha, bhojan, gharelu saamaan aadi
 Non-material culture is related to thoughts, ideals, feelings and beliefs
 samskruti ek samaaj se duusare samaaj tathaa ek desh se duusare desh main badalati rahati he
 Its development is based on historical and knowledge-related process and progress in a social or national context
 udhaaharan ke liye, hamaare abhivadan kii vidhiyon main, hamaare vastron main, khaane kii aadaton main, paariwarik sambandhon main, saamaajik or dharmik ritirivaajon or manyataon main paricham se bhinnata he
 To be fair, the people of any country are recognized by their unique cultural traditions
 samskruti or sabhyataa donon shabd praayah paryaay ke rup main prayukt kar diye jate hai
 Yet both have fundamental differences; And both have different meanings
 samskruti kaa sambandh vyakti or samaaj main nihit sanskaron se he; or uskaa nivas uske maanas main hota he
 On the other hand, the field of civilization is from the external nature of the individual and society
 'sabhy' kaa shabdic arth he, 'jo sabha main sammilit hone yogya ho'
 Therefore, civilization shapes such a civilized person and the collective form of society
 sabhyataa ko angreji main 'civillizeshan' kehete he; or culture se uskaa antar spasht hi he
 There is the same distinction between culture and civilization
 prarambh main manushya aandhi-pani, sardi-garmi sab kuch sahataa hua jangalon main rahata tha, shaniah-shaniah usne in prakritik vipadaaon se apni raksha ke liye pehle gufaaon or phir kramshah lakdi, eent yaa pathar ke makaanon kii sharan lee
 Now he has started building skyscrapers of iron and cement
 pracheen kaal main yatayaat kaa saadhan sirf maanav ke do pair hi the
 Then he took shelter of horses, camels, elephants, chariots and Bahli
 ab motor or railgadee ke dwaara thode samay main bahut lambe faasale tay karata he, hawaii jahaaj dwaara akaash main bhi udne laga he
 Earlier man used to take his sustenance from the root, root and fruit of the forest and the game
 baad main usne pashu-paalan or krishi ke avishkaar dwaara aajeevika ke sadhano main unnati kii
 Earlier he used to do all his work with physical strength
 peeche usne pashuon ko paaltu banaakar or sadhakar unki shakti kaa hal, gaadi aadi main upyog karnaa siikhaa
 In the end, he subdued the physical powers of air, water, vapor, electricity and molecules and made such machines, which transformed his physical life
 manushya kii yah sari pragati sabhyataa kehalaati he
 'civilization' means better ways of living and sometimes even bowing to nature to fulfill its needs
 iske antargat samaajon ko rajnatik rup se suparibhaashit virgon main sangathit karnaa bhi sammilit he jo bhojan, vastra, sampreshan aadi ke vishay main jivan str ko sudhaarney kaa praytn karte rahete hai
 Thus some classes consider themselves more civilized, and others look down upon them
 kuch virgon kii is manovriti ne kai baar sangharshon ko bhi janm diya he jinka parinaam manushya ke vinaashkari vidhwans ke rup main hua he
 On the contrary, culture is associated with inner cognition, which involves purity of mind and heart
 isamen kala, vigyaan, sangeet or nrity or maanav jivan kii ucchtar uplabdhiyaan sammihit hai jinhen 'saanskrithik gatividhiyaan' kaha jaataa he
 a person who is poor, wearing cheap clothes can be called rude but he can also be called the most cultured person
 ek vyakti jiske paas bahut dhan he vah sabhy to ho saktaa he par aavashyak nahin ki vah susanskrit bhi ho
 Therefore, when we think about culture, we should understand that it is different from civilization
 samskruti maanav ke antarman kaa ucchtam str he
 Human beings are not just physical
 ve teen staron par jite hai or vyavhaar karte hai - bhautik, maansik or aadhyatmik
 While progressively better ways of living socially and politically and better use of the surrounding nature can be called 'civilization', but it is not enough to be cultured
 jab ek vyakti kii buddhi or intaraatma ke gahan staron kii abhivyakti hoti he tab ham use ‘sanskrit’ kah sakate hai
 Cultural development is a historical process
 hamaare purvajon ne bahut si baaten apane purakhon se sikhi he
 Over time, he increased that with his experiences
 jo anaavashyak tha, usko unhone chhod diya
 We also learned a lot from our ancestors
 jaise-jaise samay bitta he, ham unamem nae vichaar, nai bhavanaayen jodate chale jate hai or isi prakaar jo ham upyogi nahin samajhate use chhodte jate hai
 In this way, the culture goes hand in hand from one generation to the next
 jo samskruti ham apane purvajon se praapt karte hai use saanskrithik viraasat kehete hai
 This legacy exists on many levels
 maanavtaa ne sampoorn rup main jis samskruti ko viraasat ke rup main apanaaya use 'maanavtaa kii viraasat' kehete hai
 a nation also inherits culture as heritage called 'national Cultural Heritage'
 saanskrithik viraasat main ve sabhi paksh yaa mulya sammilit hai jo manushyon ko peedi dar peedi apane purvajon se praapt hue hai
 Those values are worshiped, preserved and unceasingly preserved and generations to be proud of
 viraasat ke sanpratyay ko spasht karne ke liye kuch udhaaharan sahaayak siddh honge
 Taj Mahal, Swami Narayan Temple, Agra's Red Fort, Qutub Minar of Delhi, Mysore Palace, Jain Temple of Dilwade, Dargah of nizamuddin-auliya, Golden Temple of Amritsar
 dilli kaa sheeshganj gurudwara, sanchi stupa, goa main chrishchiyan carch, india get aadi hamaari viraasat ke mahatvapurn sthaan hai or ye kisi bhi prakaar sangrakshit kiye jane chahie
 Apart from these architectural works, buildings, artifacts, intellectual achievements, philosophy, texts of knowledge, scientific inventions and discoveries are also part of the heritage
 bhartiya sandarbh main ganit, khagol vidya or jyotish ke kshetra main boudhayan, aryabhatta or bhaskaracharya kaa yogadan, bhautikashastra ke kshetra main kanad or varahamihir kaa, rasayanashastra ke kshetra main nagarjun, aushadhi ke kshetra main sushrut or charak, yoga ke kshetra main patanjali hamaari bhartiya saanskrithik viraasat ke pragadh khajaane hai
 Culture is variable but our heritage is not variable
 bhartiya samskruti kii visheshtaayen Indian culture is the most ancient and rich culture in the world
 anya deshon kii samskritiyaan to samay kii dhara ke saath-saath nasht hoti rahi hai, kintu bharat kii samskruti aadi kaal se hi apane paramparaagat astitv ke saath ajar-amar bani hui he
 Its generosity and syncretic qualities have assimilated other cultures, but preserved the core of its existence
 tabhi to paashchaatya vidvan apane desh kii samskruti ko samajhane hetu bhartiya samskruti ko pehle samajhane kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 Characteristics of Culture The following are the salient features of Indian culture: pracheenta -bhartiya samskruti vishwa kii pracheenatam samskritiyon main se ek he
 The rock paintings found in Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh, excavations in the Narmada Valley and some other ethnographic and archaeological evidences have proved that the land of India etc
 has been the oldest work place of man
 sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa ke vivaranon se bhi pramanit hota he ki aaj se lagbhag paanch hazaar varsh pehle uttari bharat ke bahut bade bhaag main ek ucch koti kii samskruti kaa vikaas ho chukaa tha
 Similarly, the Indian culture reflected in the Vedas is not only a proof of antiquity, but it is also a great expression of Indian spirituality and thinking
 uplabdh pramaanon ke aadhaar par bhartiya samskruti se rome or unani samskruti ko pracheen tathaa misr, asyria evam babylonia jaisi samskritiyon ke samakaleen mana gaya he
 Continuity - An important feature of Indian culture is that even after thousands of years, this culture still survives in its original form, while the cultures of Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Rome have almost forgotten its original form
 bharat main nadiyon, vat, pipal jaise vrikshon, surya tathaa anya prakritik devi - devataaon kii puja archana kaa kram shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Recognition of deities, continuation of havan and methods of worship have remained unaffected till date
 vedon or vaidic dharm main karodon bharatiyon kii aasthaa or vishwaas aaj bhi utana hi he, jitna hazaron varsh purv tha
 The messages of the Gita and the Upanishads have been the basis of our inspiration and action for thousands of years
 kinchit parivartanon ke baavjood bhartiya samskruti ke aadharbhoot tattvon, jivan mulyon or vachan paddati main ek aisi nirantarataa rahi he, ki aaj bhi karodon bhartiya swayan ko un mulyon evam chintan pranali se judaa hua mahasoos karte hai or isse prerana praapt karte hai
 Resilience and tolerance - The tolerant nature of Indian culture has given it longevity and stability
 sansar kii kisi bhi samskruti main shaayad hi itani sahansheeltaa ho, jitani bhartiya samskruti main pai jaati he
 Indian Hindus do not worship or worship any deity, do or do worship or havan, etc
 Freedom was never imposed in the name of religion or culture
 isiilie pracheen bhartiya samskruti ke pratik hindu dharm ko dharm na kahkar kuch mulyon par aadhaarit ek jivan-paddati kii sangya di gai or hindu kaa abhipraay kisi dharm vishesh ke anuyaayi se na lagaakar bhartiya se lagaaya gaya
 Whenever a situation of inertia was created in this flexible form of Indian culture, some great man gave it dynamism and set its tolerance in a new aura
 is drushti se prachinkaal main buddha or mahavir ke dwaara, madhyakaal main shankaracharya, kabir, guru nanak or chaitanya mahaprabhu ke madhyam se tathaa aadhunik kaal main swami dayanand, swami vivekananda evam mahatma jyotiba phule ke dwaara kiye gaye prayaas is samskruti kii mahatvapurn dharohar ban gaye
 Receptivity - Due to the tolerance and generosity of Indian culture, there was an opportunity to develop a receptive tendency in it
 vastut: jis samskruti main loktantr evam sthayitv ke aadhaar vyapak hon, us samskruti main grahanshiltaa kii pravriti swaabhaavik rup se hi utpann ho jaati he
 In our culture, the original inhabitants here lost their identity by merging the process of coordination as well as people of the Shaka, Hun, Greeks and Kushans coming from outside
 bharat main islamic samskruti kaa aagaman bhi arabon, turkon or mughalon ke madhyam se hua
 Despite this, the Indian culture remained separate and the Indian culture did not hesitate to accept some good things from the newcomers
 thik yahi sthiti europea jatiyon ke aane tathaa british samrajya ke kaaran bharat main viksit hui isai samskruti par bhi lagu hoti he
 Although these cultures are now an integral part of Indian cultures, the nature of 'indian Islam' and 'indian Christian' cultures is somewhat different from other Islamic and Christian religions of the world
 is bhinnata kaa moolbhoot kaaran yah he ki bharat ke adhikansh musalmaan or isai mulat: bharat bhoomi ke hi nivasee hai
 Perhaps this is why there was no change in their social environment and cultural behavior and Indianness became their identity
 aadhyatmikta evam bhautikta kaa samanvay -bhartiya samskruti main ashram - vyavastha ke saath dharm, arth, kaam or moksh jaise chaar purushaarthon kaa vishisht sthaan rahaa he
 In fact, these efforts made an amazing coordination of materiality with spirituality in Indian culture
 hamaari samskruti main jivan ke aihik or parloukik donon pahaluon se dharm ko sambaddh kiya gaya tha
 Religion calls those principles, elements and life systems, so that mankind can make their cosmic life happy by developing divine powers and can experience individual peace after death
 sharir nashwar he, aatma amar he, yah amarta moksh se judi hui he or yah moksh paane ke liye arth or kaam ke purusharth karnaa bhi jaruri he
 Thus, in Indian culture, religion and salvation are interrelated with the spiritual message and the material imperative of meaning and work
 aadhyatmikta or bhautikta ke is samanvay main bhartiya samskruti kii vah vishisht avadharana parilakshith hoti he, jo manushya ke is lok or paralok ko sukhi banane ke liye bhartiya manishiyon ne nirmit kii thi
 Other cultures of the world do not worry about happy human life
 sahitya, sangeet or kala kii sampoorn vidhaon ke madhyam se bhi bhartiya samskruti ke is aadhyatmik evam bhautik samanvay ko saraltapurvak samajha ja saktaa he
 Unity in diversity - India is a country of diversities from a geographical point of view, yet its existence as a culturally entity has existed since ancient times
 is vishaal desh main uttar kaa parvatiy bhu-bhaag, jisaki seemaa purv main brahmaputra or pashchim main sindhu nadiyon tak vistrut he
 Along with this, the fertile agricultural land of Ganga, Yamuna, Sutlej, Vindhya and the plateau terrain covered by the forests of the south, Thar desert in the west, coastal region in the south and the picturesque area of assam and Meghalaya in the east
 is bhugolic vibhinnata ke atirikt is desh main aarthik or saamaajik bhinnata bhi paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 In fact, due to these differences, many cultural subsections have developed and flourished in India
 anek vibhinnataaon ke baavjood bhi bharat kii pruthak saanskrithik satta rahi he
 The Himalayas have been a symbol of the pride of the entire country, so the people of the rivers like Ganga - Yamuna and Narmada have been praising it since ancient times
 ram, krishna or shiv kii aradhana yahan sadiyon se kii jaati rahi he
 Literature based on these deities has been created in all the languages of India
 uttar se dakshin or purv se pashchim tak sampoorn bharat main janm, vivaah or mrityu ke sanskaar ek samaan prachlit hai
 There is also similarity in various customs, practices and festivals
 bhashaaon kii vividhta avashya he phir bhi sangeet, nrity or natya ke moulik swaroopon main ascharyajanak samanta he
 The seven tones of music and the trital of dance are equally popular throughout India
 bharat anek dharmon, sampradaayon, maton or pruthak aasthaaon evam vishwaason kaa mahadesh he, tathaapi iskaa saanskrithik samucchy or anekta main ekta kaa swaroop sansar ke anya deshon ke liye vismay kaa vishay rahaa he
 Culture is closely related to life
 yah koi bahya vastu nahin he or na hi koi aabhushan he jise manushya prayog kar saken
 It is not just a touch of colors
 yah vah gun he jo hamen manushya banaata he
 Human beings will not exist without culture
 samskruti paramparaon se, vishwaason se, jivan kii style se, aadhyatmik paksh se, bhautik paksh se nirantar judi he
 It teaches us the meaning of life, how to live life
 maanav hi samskruti kaa nirmaataa he or saath hi samskruti maanav ko maanav banaati he
 a fundamental element of culture is religious belief and its symbolic expression
 hamen dharmik pahchaan kaa sammaan karnaa chahie, saath hi samayik prayatnon se bhi parichit hona chahie jinase antadharmik vishwaason kii baatcheet ho sake, jinhen praayah 'antah saanskrithik vaartalap' kaha jaataa he
 As the world continues to connect, we are becoming more and more global and living on a more global scale
 ham yah nahin soch sakate ki jeene kaa ek hi tarika hota he or vahi satya maarg he
 The need for coexistence has also made the coexistence of different cultures and beliefs necessary
 isliye isse pehle ki ham is prakaar kii koi galati karen, acha hoga ki ham anya samskritiyon ko bhi jaane or saath hi apni samskruti ko bhi bhalee prakaar samajhen
 How can we discuss about other cultures until we understand the values of our culture as well
 satya, shiv or sundar ye teen shaashvat mulya hai jo samskruti se nikat se jude hai
 It is culture that brings us closer to truth through philosophy and religion
 yah hamaare jivan main kalaon ke madhyam se soundarya pradaan karti he or soundaryanubhuthaparak maanav banaati he
 It is this culture that makes us moral human beings and brings us in close contact with other human beings and teaches us lessons of love, tolerance and peace
 kisi desh kii samskruti uski sampoorn maansik nidhi ko suchit karti he
 It is not the result of the effort of a particular person, but the result of the efforts of numerous known and unknown persons
 sab vyakti apni samarthy or yogyata ke anusaar samskruti ke nirmaan main sahyog dete hai
 Culture can be compared to the coral reefs found in the sea near Australia
 muunge ke asankhya keede apane chote ghar banaakar samaapt ho gaye
 Then new insects built houses, they also came to an end
 iske baad unki agali peedi ne bhi yahi kiya or yah kram hajaaron varsh tak nirantar chalata rahaa
 Today, the little houses of all those Moogas have taken the form of huge rocks connecting them
 samskruti kaa bhi isi prakaar dhire-dhire nirmaan hota he or unke nirmaan main hajaaron varsh lagate hai
 Humans live in different places and develop their specific culture by developing special social environments, institutions, practices, systems, religion, philosophy, script, language and arts
 bhartiya samskruti kii rachana bhi isi prakaar hui he
 Culture is a set of catalytic patterns of social interactions and social behaviors
 is samucchy main gyaan, vigyaan, kala, aasthaa, naitik mulya evam prathaen samavisht hoti hai
 Culture is the collective expression of man's best practices and perfect efforts suitable for physical, economic, social and political and spiritual emergence
 yah manushya ke vaiyaktik evam saamaajik jivan ke swaroop kaa nirmaan, nirdesan, niyaman or niyantran karti he
 Therefore, culture is a manifestation of a collectivist view in the life of man, ideological philosophy and social activities
 isamen pratikon dwaara arjeet tathaa sapreshit maanavvyavhaaron ke sunishchit pratimaan sannihit hote hai
 The inevitable convergence of culture is created by chronological and accumulated traditional ideas and related values
 iskaa ek paksh maanav vyavhaar ke nirdhaaran or doosraa paksh katipay vidhivihit vyavhaaron kii pramanikta tathaa auchitypratipaadan se sambhddha hota he
 Each culture incorporates the general principles of selectivity and selectivity, through which the paradigms of human behavior in the various forms of cultural half are degradable by normalization
 saanskrithik maan, prathaon ke samanyikrut evam susangathit samavaay ke rup main sthirataa kii ore unmukh hote hai, yadhyapi samskruti ke vibhinn tatwon main parivartan kii prakriya shaashvat chalati rahati he
 Changes in a particular component are the result of acceptance and disclaimer in accordance with cultural patterns
 saanskrithik pratimaan swayan bhi parivartansheel hote hai
 The eternal process of change in the state of society affects paradigms
 saamaajik vikaas kii prakriya saanskrithik pratimaanon ke parivartan kii prakriya he
 Culture is not natural
 yah samajikaran kii prakriya dwaara arjeet hoti he
 Therefore, culture is associated with those rites, which are the means of preserving our heritage and social heritage
 inke madhyam se saamaajik vyavhaar kii vishistataaon kaa ek peedi se duusari peedi main nigaman hota he
 It is in this continuity of incorporation that culture exists and its cumulative tendency accelerates its development, from which new ideals are born
 in aadarshon dwaara bahya kriyaaon or manovaigyanik drushtikonon kaa samanyan hota he tathaa saamaajik sanrachana or vaiyaktik jeevanapaddati kaa vyavasthaapan hota rahata he
 Culture has two sides - saamaanya arth main aadhibhautik samskruti ko samskruti or bhautik samskruti ko sabhyataa ke naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 These two sides of the culture differ from each other
 samskruti abhyantar he, isamen paramparaagat chintan, kalatmak anubhuti, vistrut gyaan evam dharmik aasthaa kaa samavesh hota he
 Civilization is an external object, which includes social, economic, political, and scientific achievements helpful in human progress
 samskruti hamaare samjik jeevanapravaah kii udgamasthali he or sabhyataa is pravaah main sahaayak upkaran
 Culture is practicable and civilization is the means
 samskruti sabhyataa kii upyogita ke moolyankan ke liye pratimaan upasthit karti he
 Despite these differences, culture and civilization are interconnected and influence each other
 saanskrithik mulyon kaa spasht prabhaav sabhyataa kii pragati kii disha or swaroop par padataa he
 The civilization that is built according to these values is adopted by society
 sabhyataa kii naveen uplabdhiyaan bhi vyavhaaron, hamaari manyataon yaa duusare shabdon main hamaari samskruti ko prabhavit karti rahati he
 The process of sync goes on continuously
 sampark main aanevaali bhinn samskritiyaan bhi ek duusare ko prabhavit karti hai
 The interaction of different cultures leads to a process of cooperation or non-cooperation among them
 par donon prakriyaaon kaa lakshya vishmata ko samaapt kar samta sthaapan hi hota he
 Arrangement and assimilation in the state of cooperation are the means of equity establishment and in the event of non-cooperation, the forces of competition, opposition and struggle are activated and finally, the strong culture eliminates the weak culture and establishes equality
 samskruti ke bhautik tathaa aadhibhautik pakshon kaa vikaas samanaantar nahin hota
 The pace of development of civilization is faster than the pace of development of culture
 falswaroop sabhyataa vikascram main samskruti se aage nikal jaati he
 This imbalance of development of civilization and culture leads to social disintegration
 at: is prakaar pradurbhoot samskruti vilbanna dwaara samaaj main utpann asantulan or avyavashtha ke niraakaran hetu aadhibhautik samskruti main prayatnpurvak sudhaar aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The regulation of civilization and culture through analysis, testing and evaluation provides immense support to the physical and spiritual upliftment of human beings
 samskruti yadhyapi kisi desh yaa kalvishesh kii upaj nahin hoti, yah ek shaashvat prakriya he, tathaapi kisi kshetravishesh main kisi kaal main iskaa jo swaroop prakat hota he use ek vishisht naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 This abhidha is associated with time, philosophy, region, community or power
 madhyayugin samskruti, bhautik samskruti, paashchaatya samskruti, hindu samskruti tathaa mughal samskruti aadi kii sangyaayen isi aadhaar par pradaan kii gai hai
 Specific designation refers to the specific nature of culture, with the realization that the natural form of culture is inevitably affected by the factor that gives an adjective to the culture
 sanganak takanic, commuter hardware tathaa computer software ke vikaas karne se sambandhit kaaryon yaa kriyaaon ko sammilit rup se abhikalan kaha jaataa he
 It is that part of information technology that deals with computers
 sanganak vigyaan, soochna evam abhikalan ke saiddhanthik pahaluon ke adhyayan, unhen kaary rup main parinit karne evam unako sanganak tantra main prayog karne se sambadhit he

 samaaj main manushya ke prati teen prakaar ke aparaadh hote hai, arthath jivan ke prati, sharir ke prati, athwa swadhinata ke prati
 There are four types of crimes committed against the life of human beings - murder, suicide, feticide and infanticide
 ek manushya dwaara kisi duusare manushya kaa vadh narhatya kehalaata he
 In ancient times, all cases of homicide were given the same penalty
 lekin aadhunik kaal main ucchtar bhaawanaaon ke janm tathaa aapraadhik manovigyaan ke siddhant kaa vikaas hone ke saath narhatya ke aparaadhiyon kii dandvyavastha main antar utpann ho jaataa he
 According to modern beliefs, homicide is either legal or illegal
 vaid narhatya yaa to kshamya hoti he yaa phir nyyochit
 Accident or misfortune without any criminal intent; Or kisi balak yaa asantulit mastishkvaale vyakti dwaara paagalpan yaa nashe kii dasha main ; athwa Murder by goodwill done in favor of the deceased is excusable
 narhatyaayein nimnlikhit dashaon main nyyochit hoti hai - Punishment is not punishable in cases of excusable and justifiable homicides and hence such murders are called legitimate
 abhiyojya narhatya yaa to hatya kii shrenee main aati he yaa hatya kii shrenee main nahin aati
 If a person causes death with the intent to kill him or with intent to cause such bodily injury that death is possible or knowing that his act may lead to death, then such a person is guilty of prosecution Does
 abhiyojya narhatya ke liye ukt teen tatwon main se kisi ek kaa rahanaa aavashyak he
 Thus if someone is killed with definite intention and knowledge, then it will be a prosecution
 lekin yadi mrityu bina kisi aise iraade athwa jaankaree ke ho jaati he to yah abhiyojya narhatya nahin hogi
 Maliciousness or bad intentions are not necessary for this
 udhaahranswaroop yadi a jaan lene ke iraade se athwa is jaankaree ke saath ki uske kaary se mrityu sambhavit he, ek gadde ke upar patali lakadiyaan or ghaas daal detaa he or ja use thos bhoomi samajhakar usapar chalaa jaataa he, gir padataa he or mar jaataa he ta a is hatya kaa apradhi he
 Again, a knows that j is behind the bush, and he knows this
 a ja kii jaan lene ke iraade se ba ko jhaadi par goli chalaane ke liye prerit karata he
 He shoots and he is killed
 yahan par va nirparaadh ho saktaa he lekin a abhiyojya narhatya karata he
 Similarly, a hunts the victim and shoots him with the aim of stealing, which causes b to die behind the bush
 a yah nahin jaanata tha ki ba vahaan khadaa he
 Although a was committing an illegal act here, he is not a criminal of prosecution because he did not intend to kill him nor did he know that anyone could die from his act
 is drushtaant se yah niyam pratipaadit hota he ki yadi kaai apradhi ek aparaadh karte hue kisi kii mrityu kaa kaaran banataa he jab ki uskaa na aisa iraadaa tha or na vah yah jaanata tha ki aisa kaary mrityu kaa kaaran ban saktaa he to aise vyakti ko keval usee aparaadh ke liye dand diya jayega, durghatanavash jaan lene ke liye nahin
 Prosecutive homicide does not exist as a special offense
 iskaa prayog mul arth main hi hota he or isiilie bhartiya dand samhita main iske liye dand kaa vidhaan nahin he
 It is of two types
 arthath abhiyojya narhatya jo hatya kii shrenee main aati he or abhiyojya narhatya jo hatya kii shrenee main nahin aati 
 Under English law, the other is called Manavadh
 abhiyojya narhatya hatya samajhi jaati he yadi vah kaary, jisase mrityu hoti he- It is done with the intention of taking life; Or yadi vah kaary aisi shaareerik chot pahunchaane ke iraade se kiya jaataa he jiske bare main apradhi jaanata he ki jis vyakti kaa chot pahunchaai jaaegi uski mrityu hone kii sambhaavna he ; athwa If the act is intended to cause bodily injury to a person, and the injury thus inflicted is sufficient to cause death naturally; Or yadi us kaary ko karanevaala vyakti yah jaanata he ki uskaa kaary itnaa khatarnaak he ki paprayek dasha main isse mrityu hone kii purna sambhaavnaayen hai athwa vah aisi shaareerik chot pahunchaata he jisase mrityu hone kii sambhaavna he or jaan le lene ke khatre ko uthaae bina kisi kaaran ke aisa kaary karata he athwa purvakthith aisi chot pahunchaata he
 For example, unprovokedly shoots a loaded gun at a crowd of humans and kills a person in them
 aisi dasha main a hatya kaa apradhi he, yadhyapi ho saktaa he, uski kisi vyaktivishesh ko jaan se maarane kii koi purvanirdhaarit yojana na rahi ho
 He will be called the culprit of murder because his work is so dangerous that it will cause death in every case
 koi aparaadh tab tak hatya kii shrenee main nahin aayega jab tak vah abhiyojya narhatya kii paribhaasha ke antargat nahin aata kyonki swayan hatya kii paribhaasha un dashaon kii ore sanket karti he jinamein abhiyojya narhatya hatya kii shrenee main nahin aa saktin
 For example, when it comes under any one of the five exceptions to section 300
 ek samay tha jab yah samajha jaataa tha ki abhiyojya narhatya or hatya ke bich kaa antar keval dhara 300 ke paanch apwaad hi hai
 But now it is certain that there is a difference between the two, although there is no difference between them
 jaan lenaa donon main ubhaynishth he
 The act which leads to death is the act of the criminal and in both the cases criminal intent or information is mandatory
 vaastavik antar iraade athwa jaankaree kii saapekshata main he
 The intention or knowledge of killing in a fatal way is more than that of prosecution
 jaan lene kii sabhi dashaon main ye donon aparaadh aapas main ek duusare ke na bahishkaarkarta he or na vistaarkarta
 Normally, when the intention is to take life, the crime committed is murder, if it does not fall under any of the five exceptions to section 300
 yadi a jaanata he ki ba kii tilli badi hui or is tathy kii jaankaree ke saath a uski tilli ke kshetra main shaktipurvak ghunsa martha he or ba mar jaataa he to yah aparaadh hatya he, abhiyojya narhatya nahin, kyonki a ko vishesh jaankaree thi
 Again, if death by bodily injury is probable, it is prosecutable homicide
 jab ki yadi aisi shaareerik chot pahunchaane kaa iraadaa he jo saamaanya rup se jaan lene ke liye kaaphi he, to yah hatya hogi
 In other words, if the result of the work done is death in all possible cases, then it is murder while if there is only a possibility of death then the crime is prosecution
 abhiyojya narhatya kii, jo hatya kii shrenee main nahin aati, athwa english vidhi main maanavwadh kii paribhaasha kahin nahin di gai he or na isaki aavashyaktaa hi samajhi gai hai
 There are two types of crime under this: ve jo abhiyojya narhatya ke antargat aate hai kintu hatya kii paribhaasha ke antargat nahin aate ; or Those who fall under the five exceptions of section 300
 ham pratham prakaar ke maamalon kaa drushtaant sabase pehle denge
 If an act is done with the intention of causing bodily injury that is likely to cause death, then it is a homicide
 udhaaharan swaroop a apni patni ko purna shakti se tamaacha lagaataa he
 As a result, he falls and dies
 is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin he ki vah biimaar thi
 In such a situation, a is guilty of homicide
 yadi praan lene ke iraade kaa abhaav he or jaanch kaa fal yah he ki kaary is jaankaree ke saath kiya gaya tha ki usase mrityu hone kaa sambhaavna thi to yah maanavwadh he
 For example, when someone is fed a datura to make it easier to rob, which leads to his death, this crime is a homicide
 kabhi-kabhi yah nishchit karnaa kathin ho jaataa he jab apane aparaadh ke chihn chhipaane ke liye ek vyakti kisi kii jaan le letaa he jise vah mrit samajhataa he
 For example, a strikes three on his head with the intention of killing B
 falswaroop ba behosh hokar gir padataa he yadhyapi vah mara nahin he
 a considers him dead and sets fire to the hut in which he is lying, to destroy all evidence of crime
 doctor sakshya yah he ki mrityu jalane se hui he, praharon se nahin
 The Bombay High Court, in "samrat v
 Khand", ruled by majority that a is guilty of attempting to commit murder, not murder
 asahmat nyaayadhish shri parson ne usko is aadhaar par hatya kaa apradhi hona hona nishchit kiya ki donon kaary - prahaar karnaa or jhopadi jalaana ek duusare se itani ghanishthata se sambhddha hai ki ve ek hi prakriya - mritak kii jaan lene - ke ang hai
 Several High Courts in our country have supported this view of Judge Mr
 Parson and accepted by the Privy Council in "meri v
