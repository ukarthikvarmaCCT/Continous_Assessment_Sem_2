 The BJP expressed its displeasure when Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar returned the amount sent for Kosi flood relief to Gujarat and asked whether by doing so, he could also return the sentiment and sympathy towards the flood victims
 bhaajapa pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne kaha, ‘‘jab dhan diya gaya to vah bihar ke baadh prabhaviton kii mushkilon ke prati gujarat kii janata kii ekajutata or samanubhuti kaa pratik tha
 He said that it was not appropriate to return the money in Bihar's local newspapers for an advertisement published by a Bihari youth
 nirmala ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa naam liye bina kaha, ‘‘bihar ne tab vah dhan usee bhaavana main sweekaar kiya tha jis bhaavana se gujarat ne diya tha
 Now due to some advertisement, the Chief Minister (nitish) has decided to return it
 mujhe hairaani he ki kya dhan hi lautaaya gaya he yaa samanubhuti, ekajutata or bhaichaare kii bhaavana ko bhi lautaaya gaya he
 During the recently held National Executive of the BJP in Patna, advertisements were published in local newspapers thanking the Chief Minister of Gujarat for assistance during the 2008 Kosi floods
 kuch vigyapanon main nitish or modi ke haath milaate chitra bhi chaape gaye the
 Nitish termed those advertisements as "unbearable" and said that public support is not praised

 For several days, the issue of conversion of 57 Muslim families in Agra has been the subject of discussion in news papers and television

 Now further news is that in Aligarh on 25th December i
e
 Christmas day, 5000 people are getting ready to 'return home' to Hinduism
 kuch log aisi ghatana ko bharat ke secular dhaanche ke khilaaf bataa rahe hai or kuch log ise 'ghar-vaapasi' kah rahe hai or kehete hai ki agar koi apni bhul sudharkar swechha se ghar vaapasi karnaa chahta he to isamen kisi ko koi aapatti nahin honi chahie
 Religion is right, wrong, we will discuss it later, but will talk about a tweet in the social networking site, which is completely different from the views of the leaders who warmed the Parliament and people on the street
 twit main tha, 'bhartiya patrkaar tab hangaamaa nahin karte jab hinduon kaa jabardastee dharm-parivartan karaayaa jaataa he
 Why then becomes big news when Muslims are made Hindus
 ' ye kahana kisi sanghee, bhaajapai kaa nahin balki bangladesh kii prasiddh lekhika taslima nasrin kaa he
 Taslima Nasreen further says, 'first Muslims and Christians forced people to eat and money and forced conversions, now Hindus are doing the same
 bina jabardastee dharm-parivartan ke islam kaa astitv hi nahin hota
 " ab taslima vividit lekhika hai to ye bhi zaruri he ki samay-samay par 'vivaadit' baat bhi karengi
 Some people will agree with his tweet today and some people disagree
 par kitna sach he, aaie yah jaanane kii koshish karte hai
 On 25 June 2012, Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy informed the Legislative Assembly that from 2006 to 2012, 7713 people converted to Islam while only 2803 people became Hindus
 2009-2012 ke bich 2687 mahilaayein muslim baniin, jisamen 2195 hindu thim or 492 isai thim
 Both the local and national media did not express such a big news then nor did it become so serious that it could become a topic of discussion in Parliament
 duusari jaankaree he, odisha ke kandhamal kii, jise bhi media ne samvedansheel nahin samajha
 Perhaps it was not a case against minorities
 sirf ikkaa-dukka samachar patron ne apane pannon main ise jagah di
 Kandhamal has long been a center of vigor between Christian and Hindu organizations
 rashtriya alpsankhayak ayog ne 2008 main hue kandhamal dangon kii report main mana ki is kshetra main hinduon ke mukaable isaayiyon kii jansankhya main baari izaafaa hua he
 According to the Indian census, the population of Christians in Kandhamal was only 19,128 in 1961, which increased to one lakh 17 thousand in 2001, an increase of 66 percent in forty years
 haalanki odisha ke freedom of relijan act 1967, jabardastee dharm parivartan ke khilaaf he
 But this law also says that, with the approval of the magistrate, anyone can change his religion
 itane saal biit jane ke baad sirf do logon ne hi dharm-parivartan ke liye aavedan kiya he
 The state government also does not have the answer to the rapid increase in the population of Christians in this area
 rashtriya alpsankhayak ayog ne apni 2008 kii report main kaha kii rajya main 40 saalon se freedom of relijan act lagu he par abhi tak jabardastee dharm-parivartan kaa ek bhi cese darz nahin hua he
 Even though no one used coercion, there have been many cases of seduction and seduction
 ye to baat thi hamaari media kii ki use koun si khabar samvedansheel lagati he or koun si nahin
 Now, let's talk about the conversion of proselytism in English and return home in RSS language
 aryasamajiyon main shuddhikaran, isaayiyon main baptism kii vidhi hoti he
 You can come to Islam by saying 'l'ilaha ilal-allah' and 'muhammad-ur Rasul Allah'
 par hindu sanghathan vaale ye nahin jaanate ki hindu dharm main dharm-parivartan karwaane kii koi vidhi nahin he, koi vyavastha nahin he
 Now know which Ved Mantras of Hindu organizations are converting by reading the Ved Mantra
 azaadi ke baad se hi dharm-parivartan kaa mudda samvedansheel bana hua he
 Though no law has been enacted at the Center, some states have enacted laws such as Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh
 phir bhi logon ko laalach de kar yaa bahala phusalaakar unka dharm-parivartan aaj bhi karavaaya ja rahaa he
 It is a matter of sadness that the media of India does not think this issue serious or against the secularism of India unless its victim is from a minority community
 aaj bhi puure vishwa main islam or isai dharm kaa vistaar ho rahaa he, nahin to isaayiyon kii sankhya aaj do arab or musalamaanon kii sankhya ek arab 80 karod nahin hoti

 Randall Shriver, assistant secretary of the indo-pacific Security Affairs, said, "I think that after India's decision on Kashmir, many major cross-border attacks can be executed
" haalanki mujhe nahin lagata ki china is tarah ke hamale kaa samarthan karegaa yaa use sahi batayega

 adhikari prashikshan academy main unhone media se kaha tha ki pakistan ne haal hi main balakot ko phir sakriy kar diya he

 giraftaar badmaash par lut or chori ke darjanon mukademe darj hai
 The purse which was looted by the youth of the area along with illegal weapons and bikes has also been recovered by the police
 beeti shuukravaar raat kareeb 10 baje police ko 100 number par soochna mili thi ki irfan naamak yuvak se bike savaar do badmaashon ne lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 On this information, the police started checking and laid siege when only two bike riders started firing on the police

 Like the villain's ballu Balaram, the jails break the jail, i will be away soon
 yah kisi film kaa dialog nahin balki rajasthan kii ajmer jail main band pradesh ke kukhyat gangster anandapal singh ke bol the
 And a few days later, the infamous Anandpal, named AP, escaped in exactly the same manner
 pichley 3 sitambar ko nagaur jile ke deedwanaa main nanuram hatyakand main anandapal kii peshi ke baad police escort main use waapas ajmer jail laayaa ja rahaa tha
 As the police van arrived near Gangwa village in Parbatsar, some miscreants in the pickup followed him
 unhone bollywood style main police javaanon par goliyon kii bauchhaar kar unhen ghayal kar diya or anandapal tathaa uske saathi subhash mandu or shreevallabh ko chhudaa le gaye
 But the story is not so straightforward
 is ghatana ne rajasthan main na sirf gangvaar kii ashanka ko badha diya he balki jat or rajput samudaay aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 Anandpal of the Rajput community has been in the news for the 2006 Gopal Phogawat and Jeevan Godara killings, as well as the gang war in Bikaner jail in 2014
 jat samudaay ke uske pratispardhi raju tehat gang ne jail main us par hamalaa bol diya tha
 Fogawat and Godara also belonged to the Jat community and Anandpal became a Rajput symbol against Jat criminals
 so, ek baar phir jat samudaay main naaraazgi he to anandapal samarthakon main khushi
 The Jad community became agitated after the Godara murder case in 2006
 uski ore se darjanon dharne-pradarshan ke baad aakhirkaar 2012 main anandapal kii giraftaar ke baad yah sab khatm hua tha
 Now he is in the same situation again after his absconding
 jaaton ne pichley dinon deedwanaa main hi sabha kii or khinvsar se nirdaleey vidhayak or jat netaa hanuman beniwal ne vasundhara raaje sarkaar par jamkar aarope jade
 He accused Minister Younis Khan of complicity with Anandpal and also took minister Rajendra Singh Rathore and Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje into custody
 beniwal ne aarope lagaaya, ''anandapal ko sarkaar ke bade netaaon kaa sangrakshan hasil he, unheen ke ishaare par vah faraar hua he
 "khan and Rathore reject it outright
" rathod kehete hai, ''yah aapraadhik maamla he, ise siyaasi tool nahin diya janaa chahie
 After the anger of the Jats, the Karni Sena and other organizations of the Rajput community have also made a noise
 karani sena ke sukhdev singh gogamedi kehete hai, ''kanoon apana kaam kare to hamen koi aapatti nahin, lekin agar jat netaaon ke kehane par anandapal kaa encounter kiya jaataa he to rajput samudaay ise sahan nahin karegaa
 DGP Manoj Bhatt has suspended 12 policemen including Parbatsar Police Station in this case
 lekin isse police kii laaparvaahee nahin chhipati
 The police had already suspected Anandpal to be absconding
 nagaur ke purv espi raghavendra suhasaa ne police headquarter ko chitthee likh yah ashanka jataai thi or kaha tha ki uski peshi ke liye video conferencing kii vyavastha kii jaae
 But nothing like this happened
 or to or, jis din vah faraar hua, us din uske escort main kareeb 15 pulicekarmi hi tainaat the, jabaki amuman isamen isse zyada pulicekarmi hote the
 Four months ago, Anuradha Chaudhary, a notorious supporter of Anandpal, also told that he would soon be absconding
 jaahir he, police kii bhoomika sandehaaspad he
 The soldiers of the same escort team were giving many facilities to the notorious arms smuggler Amin Khan who was lodged in Ajmer jail
 yahaan tak ki kuch hafte pehle court main uski peshi ke din use ghar kii saiyr bhi karai gai
 Even after informing the DGP, no action was taken on it
 2012 main anandapal kii giraftaar kam naatakeey nahin thi
 He was easily captured from a farm house in Jaipur with a stock of arms
 kuch log ise purvaniyojit bataate hai kyonki agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone the or jat uske girakrataar na hone se gusse main the
 Some people also believe that there was an increased risk for him outside, so a play was created to keep him safe inside the prison
 ab uske bhaag jane ko bhi kuch aise hi dekha ja rahaa he
 He escaped in the Bikaner jail gangwar but his partner Balbir Banuda was killed
 phir use bikaner se ajmer jail shift kar diya gaya
 In such a situation, he was in danger in jail
 sarkaar ke liye musibatanandpal kaa rajya ke shekhavati kshetra main kaaphi prabhaav he
 In Rajputs, he is considered like Robinhood
 deedwanaa se kuch hi dur par uske gaanv sawaraad main uske kuch saathi naam na chhapane kii shart par bataate hai, ''vah har kisi kii madad ko taiyaar rahata tha
 At the same time, Sukhdev Singh of Karni Sena says that Anandpal did not look back after fighting with BDO and getting caught in the 2002 Kheraj murder case
 uske saath kai apradhi judate gaye or usne kareeb 500 gurgon kaa gang bana liya
 His fight with Jat criminals was well known
 vah jail se bhi phiroti-apharan jaisi vaardaaton ko anjaam detaa tha
 One of his brothers Rupendrapal Singh is also absconding and the other, Manjeet is in jail
 duusari ore, esaoji or aties anandapal ke faraar hone kii chaanbin kar rahe hai
 "the policemen posted in Anandpal's escort are being questioned and raided," says Ajmer's IG Malini Agarwal
 '' us par ek lakh ru
 And Rs 50,000–50,000 on his peers
 kaa inaam ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria admitted the lapse of police but made an irresponsible statement about it, "I have no magic wand
" '' lekin jat or rajput sanghathanon kaa phir aamane-saamne aana khatre kii ghanti he
 While Rajputs have already supported the BJP, in the last elections, Raje turned a large number of Jats towards the party
 ab anandapal masalaa raaje sarkaar ke liye badi musiibat ban saktaa he

 Religion is making people animals
 ”yah puniya kaa hi idia tha ki jai jai bhim ko ‘dalit geet’ qaraar diya jaae
 They say that by doing this we will not only pay tribute to Babasaheb Ambedkar, it will also strengthen the sense of self-respect among the Dalits

 Apart from this, due to sluggishness in the economy, no significant increase in salary or income, people are also unable to dare to buy a vehicle

 There is a slowdown in the rural economy and the monsoon rains have come less than expected
 rabi kii paidaavaar to ummid se kam hone ke sanket mil hi rahe hai, kharif kii buvaai bhi ummid ke mutabik nahin ho pai he
 All these reasons have affected the sales of tractors

 According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), 9 in the commercial vehicles segment from April to June 2019
 53 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Not only this, two-wheeler sales have also seen a decline, while this segment sells very economical vehicles and is dependent on the consumption of middle or lower class people and rural areas

 The auto industry is one of the main jobs sector in the country, but due to its crisis, layoffs have started and it will now have an impact on other auto related sectors

 There has been ongoing fighting between Iraqi security forces and Sunni militant groups in many provinces of Iraq
 mangalvaar ko sangharsh main kam se kam 64 aatankwaadi maare gaye or yahaan tak ki sangharsh vaale kshetron se 17 or bharatiyon ko surakshit nikaal liya gaya
 Lt Gen Qasim Atta, security spokesman for Prime Minister Nouri al-maliki, said in a press conference that security forces in Salahuddin province with air support countered several attacks by dozens of terrorists, some 200 kilometers north of the capital Baghdad, in the town of Baizi
 Were trying to control the oil refinery located near
 atta ne kaha, 'baiji rifinary iraqi suraksha balon ke purna niyantran main he
 a provincial security source said that 17 people were killed during the day in airstrikes carried out around the refinery and at militant posts in Baiji city
 rifinary par kiskaa niyantran he, is bare main paraspar virdohi khabaren aa rahi hai
 Provincial police sources and media reports said that the militants captured the refinery by night
 iske pehle sainikon ke saath unka ek samjhauta hua, jiske tahat unhen shantipurvak nihathe hokar apni chaukiyon se jane kii anumati di gai
 But Atta denied such reports and confirmed that the refinery was under full control of the security forces
 isse pehle islamic state of iraq and greater syria (iesas) se jude aatankwaadi baiji shahar ke saath hi saath sunni bahul salahuddin praant or uski rajdhani tikrit par chaa gaye the
 Tikrit is located 170 kilometers from the country's capital, Baghdad
 atta ne kaha ki iraq ke purvi diyaala praant main udhim shahar main or uske aasapaas ladaai jari he
 The troops carried out several attacks on three side Sunni militant posts in the city, killing 21 militants
 atta ne kaha ki anbar praant main suraksha balon ne sakalawiah shahar main aatankwaadi samoohon par hamale kiye, or 24 ladaakon ko maar giraaya or unke chah vaahan nasht kar die
 The place is located north of the city of Faluja, occupied by terrorists
 is bich atta ne pushti kii ki seemaa rakshak or anya suraksha bal abhi bhi jordan ke saath lage taribil pargaman bindu or syria se lage al-walid pargaman bindu par abhi gherebandi kiye hue hai
 He said that two border crossing points are still occupied by terrorists
 shuukravaar ko aatankwaadiyon ne baghdad se koi 330 kilometre dur al-kim shahar ke sameep syria kii seemaa par sthit pargaman chaukiyon par niyantran kar liya tha or suraksha balon ke saath sangharsh ke baad kai chaukiyon ko bhi kabje main le liya tha
 Meanwhile, in New Delhi, the Indian government said on Tuesday that 17 more Indians have been evacuated from the troubled areas of Iraq
 videsh mantralay ne kaha he, 'iraqi adhikariyon kii madad se ham 17 or bharatiyon ko sanshargh vaale ilaakon se khaali karaane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 They are currently in Baghdad and will return soon
 ' mantralay ke pravaktaa saiyad akbaruddin ne kaha ki mosul main apahrit 39 bharatiyon ko kisi kism kii yatnaa nahin di gai he or unhen koi chot yaa nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya gaya he

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi gujarat chunaav se pehle or ab ek alag andaaj main dikh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi launched an aggressive campaign, giving a tough fight to the BJP
 lekin jis tarah se rahul gujarat main haar ke baad bhi pyaar se modi par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Seeing this, questions began to arise in the mind whether the Congress is changing or is there a fifth generation style
 sawaal ek or bhi he ki kya beete saadhe teen baras baad modi kaa andaaj ekresata paidaa kar rahaa he or ab janata-media korahulka andaaj acha lagane laga
 But what will happen with this, and why will the public choose the carbon copy
 yani corban copy original ko takkar to de sakati he par orajanical ho nahin sakati
 The biggest crisis facing Rahul Gandhi is that the Rahul style of opposing Modi is Modi style
 nitiyon ke virodh kaa tarika janata ke gusse ko modi ke khilaaf bhunaane kaa he
 The way of opposing corruption is to ask for answers instead of justifying anti-people
 yani rahul kii raajnneeti ke kendra main narendra modi hi hai or congress kii raajnneeti ke kendra main rahul raaj he, to phir janata kaha he or janata ke sawaal kahaan hai
 It is right to see Rahul Gandhi win in his defeat, because for the first time the good performance of the Congress in Gujarat has given a fillip to the opposition
 narendra modi ke khilaaf ab kahin zyaada majbootee se vipaksh ladega
 Further, Rahul Gandhi can walk on his election model of Gujarat
 vipaksh kii duusari partiyaan bhi rahul gandhi ko netaa maanane par majaboor ho sakati he
 But it also depends on the performance of Karnataka, MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh
 kyonki saakh kaa sawaal rahul gandhi par bhi gujarat main achche parformens ke baavjood uthegaa
 In the last 5 years, Congress has lost 27 elections, breaking the record with the prominent face of Rahul Gandhi
 is trek record ko dekhakar hi sawaal ye he agar gujarat kii tikdi kaa sahaara naa hota, to kya congress ko rahul gandhi 80 ke number tak bhi pahunchaa pate

 ek salaami ballebaaj ke liye, swing kaa saamana bouns ke mukaable adhik mushkil hota he
 Personally, i think i will deal with the bounce, but if the ball is swinging, it is difficult for any batsman
 ' Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of doing politics of polarization, the Congress on Sunday launched a major attack
 congress ke varisht netaa or mahasachiv ghulaam nabi azaad ne kaha ki ye acchhee baat he ki pradhanmantri modi ne 'man kii baat' main raksha bandhan kaa zikr kiya
 There are also 15-20 million Muslims living in the country and Ramadan is going on
 piem iskaa bhi zikr kar kehete ki mil kar id manaayenge
 If Diwali comes then Diwali together
 christmas aegi to christmas manaayenge
 But pms only want to polarize selectively
 azaad pradhanmantri modi ke man kii baat kaarykram main kahi gai us baat zikr kar rahe the, jisamen modi ne raksha bandhan ke maukey par ghar main baratan dhone vaali yaa kheton main kaam karne vaali mahila mazaduron ko jansuraksha yojana tohfe main dene kii baat kar rahe the
 Azad says that it is in the country's culture that Hindu sisters tie rakhi to Muslim brothers as well
 lekin ye modi kii raajnneeti ko suut karata he ki ve sirf ek dharm ko lekar chalane kii baat karen
 The Congress selectively responded to what was said in PM Modi's 'mann Ki Baat' program
 azaad ne modi ko sapanom kaa saudagar qaraar dete hue kaha ki ve chunaav ke chah maheene pehle se sapane bech kar rahe hai
 People of such dreams sold dreams even during the day that when Modi becomes Prime Minister all his dreams will be fulfilled
 sapane to puure hue nahin or modi abhi bhi sapane bechney main lage hai, jabaki janata kii apeksha pehle kiye gaye sapanom ko puraa karne kii he
 LK Advani, one of the bjp's guiding boards, had said in an interview to a newspaper recently that maintaining the trust of the people is the biggest responsibility of a politician
 jo naitikta kii maang he, vahi rajdharm he
 The Congress took a dig at Advani and made a statement on Prime Minister Modi
 azaad ne kaha ki adwani jaise sanket nahin dete saaf saaf kah dete hai lekin jo naa samajhe uskaa kya
 Many senior BJP leaders have started talking about the mind, but the Prime Minister is ignoring everyone
 tippaniyan On the insistence of the resignation of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia, the Congress also questioned Modi's silence
 aarope lagaaya ki bade modi or chote modi main mileebhagat he isliye koi karrwai nahin ho rahi
 It is also not being told what the NDA government has done in 13 months to bring Lalit Modi
 videsh mantralay is babat artiai kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar chukaa he
 All this is happening under a well thought-out plot
 'man kii baat' kaarykram main pradhanmantri ne upie sarkaar par aayush ko darkinar rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya to congress ne puraani salanaa report pesh kar iskaa bhi jawaab diya
 It was claimed that the UPA government gave more importance to Ayush
 modi sarkaar ne to ulta iske fund main katautee kar di he
 Azad was referring to what was said in Prime Minister Modi's Mann Ki Baat program, in which Modi was giving gifts to women laborers who wash kitchen or work in fields on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
 
 azaad kaa kahana he ki ye desh kii samskruti main he ki hindu bahan musalmaan bhaaiyon ko bhi raakhi baandhti hai
 But it suits Modi's politics that they should talk about just one religion
 congress ne piem modi ke 'man kii baat' kaarykram main kahi gai baton kaa chun- chun kar jawaab diya
 Describing Modi as a dream dealer, Azad said that he has been selling dreams since six months before the election
 itane sapane beche ke log din main bhi sapane dekhne lage ki jab modi pradhanmantri banenge to unke saare sapane puure ho jaaegein
 Dreams have not been fulfilled and Modi is still engaged in selling dreams, whereas the dream is to fulfill the dreams made earlier than the public

 congress ne adwani ke is bayaan ko aadhaar bana kar pradhanmantri modi par chutki lee
 Azad said that Advani does not give any indication like that, but he clearly states what he does not understand
