 During review of departmental works in Revenue Council on Saturday, Shivpal Yadav said that officers go for lunch then come after two-three hours

 This has a negative impact on the work of the complainants and subordinates who come for work

 The system has destroyed society and family, ignoring education
 har rajya main aaj se bees saal pehle 4-5 achche kalege to hote hi the jinke prophessoron kaa naam tha, unki class main jane ke liye chaatro ke bich maaraa-maari hoti thi, unki imaarat bhi shandaar hua karti thi, ye sab aaj bhi he magar bagair shikshak ke khandhar main badal gaya he
 Bihar is a college, Langat Singh College
 3 july, 1899 ke rose is college ko banane kaa faisla hua tha tab babu langat singh ghode par paisa lad kar le aae the
 On this day he called the zamindars of the area
 sabane khulkar zamin or paisa daan diya
 The biggest contribution was by Langat Singh
 is college kii imaarat bhavy he, ise oxford ke baleole college ke jaisaa banaaya gaya tha
 Indo Saracenic is made in the architectural style
 117 saal puraane is college kii deevaaron ne ek se ek lamhe dekhe hai
 The college used to have its own gas plant for chemistry lab
 champaran satyagrah ke dauraan gandhi ji ke sampark main aae acharya jibi kriplani isi langat singh kalege main padhaate the
 Gandhiji has also come here
 pratham raashtrapati rajendra prasad, rashtrakavi ramdhaari singh dinakar bhi yahaan padhaa chuke hai
 The name of this college remained in education, IAS, IPS used to be from here every year, people used to proudly tell that LS is from college
 nack ne is college ko e grad diya he or ujisi ne isaki imaarat ko dharohar kii shrenee main rakhaa he
 Does Langat Singh have the same history today, does the youngster of Muzaffarpur or North Bihar leave Delhi University and enroll in Langat Singh College, is Langat Singh College the first choice today
 59 acre main faile ise college ke campus ko dekhne bhi log jaaya karte hai
 On the website of Langat Singh College, checked how many posts are vacant here
 college main 15 vibhaag hai or paanch hazaar chaatr hai
 There are 92 Professor Permanentes here, but 57 are Permanente
 35 shikshakon kaa post khaali hai jinke sthaan par edock yaa asthaayee professor padhaate hai
 We checked the website and found out at our level, there was a lot of difference, which is like this- - farsi, maithili, zoology main ek bhi professor yaa lekturer nahin
 - 6 posts are approved in Zoology but all posts are empty
 - chemistry main 9 permanent post he magar 5 professor hi padhaa rahe hai
 7 teachers are approved in history, but 3 are lecturers
 langat singh college main ganit ke kabhi 11 professor hua karte the, lekin is vakt do hi professor rah gaye hai
 Out of this, he has gone on to become an exam controller
 yani college ke ganit vibhaag main ek hi professor hai
 In these empty posts, no one teaches temporarily
 2002 se is college main kai vokational course shuru kiye gaye, jaise bibie, bisie, bachalers in jarnalism aadi
 In none of these courses is the approval for permanent faculty approved
 17-17 saal se yahaan shikshak asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe hai, is ummid main ki kisi din permanent ho jaaenge
 You cannot imagine what these professors do after college to run their own home
 vokational course ke teacher ko ek class ke liye 400 rupaya milte hai
 Can not teach more than 20 classes in a month
 kai shikshakon ne bataaya ki maheene main adhikt 12-15 class hi ho paati hai
 They do not earn more than 10,000 a month by teaching in college
 aap sochie ki kis sapane ke saath 1899 main langat singh college bana hoga or 2017 tak uski kya haalat ho gai he
 When there are no teachers in the class, what will happen to the students there
 yah mat sochiega ki yah pichley ek saal main hua he
 For 20 years, continuous neglect has made the condition of every major college in the country
 federation of uniwarsity teachers association of bihar, phuta ke sanjay sharma ne bataaya ki sahibganj zile ke chanderdev narayan mahavidhyalay main ek saal tak to ek hi professor the
 It seemed that they were joking, then when i spoke to the sources there, it was found that the students there have been having this joke for many years
 1969 main chandev narayan mahavidhyalay kii sthapana hui thi
 There are 3500 students studying here but from 2016 till recently there was only one professor
 2014 main yahaan 8 professor the, 2015 main 5 ho gaye, 2016 main ek hi bache
 This college continued to rely on the professor of mathematics
 15 din pehle yahaan angrezi or manovigyaan ke lekturer kii niyukti hui
 That means a weight of 3500 students responsible for a total of three professors
 kya teen professor 3500 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai? post he 23 shikshakon kii
 Who will laugh at the joke being made with the students of Sahebganj, the students themselves or the people running the system
 unhen pataa he chunaav bina iske bhi jeeta ja saktaa he
 Temporary teachers also taught in some courses at Chandev Narayan College but none comes due to low salary
 tab unhen 4950 rupaya masik miltaa tha
 Think, just think, think less or do not think that under 5000 someone will teach in college
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki gramin ilaakon ke collejon kii haalat to or bhi kharaab he
 BR Ambedkar University's budget report for 2017-18 sent to the state government, the situation looks even more frightening
 kuch collejon kaa hisaab de de rahe hai taaki vahaan ke noujvaan sthaayee niyukti ke liye apane pratinidhiyon par dabaav daal saken
 The university's PG department should have 230 teachers, but only 101 are teaching
 aarasi college, sakara main 24 shikshakon kii jagah maatr 4 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Doctor SK Sinha Female College Motihari should have 29 teachers but only 7
 mjeke college, betia main 67 pad hai magar 17 shikshak hi tainaat hai Looking at the list of a university, it seems that the posts are not being filled deliberately
 yaa to bhartee nahin hoti yaa hoti he to kai saal tak prakriya hi chalati rahati he
 Surprisingly, all the big people of the area know this
 naujavaanon ko bhi yah baat maaloom he
 But nobody has seen that everyone has put pressure on the mlas and mps to make appointments in the college, studies should go well
 uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr ke ek college kaa haal ab lete hai
 Bulandshahr has two government and 10 aided degree colleges, most of the colleges are short of teachers
 1956 main diavi degree college banane ke liye bulandshahr ke vyapaariyon ne khub daan diya, zamin di
 At that time it was the only PG college in the city
 aaj yahaan 3000 se adhik chaatr to padhate hai magar padhaane vaale shikshak nahin hai
 40 posts are acceptable, but work is going on with 20 teachers
 kya 20 shikshak 3000 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai
 All these 20 professors have been teaching only temporarily for 20-20 years
 yani is kalege main ek bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 The Chairman of the English Department has been teaching Adhoc for 23 years
 23 saal main inaki selary 2200 se badhkar 8000 ho gai he
 Teachers have been teaching here temporarily for twenty years
 usee tarah chemistry vibhaag kii adhyaksh suvidha choudhary bhi kai saal se yaha edock par padhaa rahi hai
 You might wonder what would be happening to the students of this college
 ham bhavishya bana rahe hai yaa bhavishya bigaadane kaa rashtriya project chal rahaa he bharat main
 Unbelievable when Professor Vikas Sharma, President of Meerut University Association, said that sixty percent posts in degree colleges are vacant all over UP
 agar itane pad khaali hai jo phir itane chunaav ho chuke, kabhi ye sab mudda kyon nahin bana
 Did nobody want a job in college, did the students have to study without a professor
 phir se rajasthan chalate he
 Here took the condition of Jayanarayan Vyas University which was established in 1962
 iskaa udghaatan 24 agast, 1962 ko bharat ke raashtrapati dow
 s
 radhakrishnan ne kiya tha
 Earlier it was also called Jodhpur University
 iske kaamyaab chaatro kii suchi shandaar he
 Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Jodhpur MP and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajender Singh Shekhawat, former Rajya Sabha MP LM Singhvi have also been students of this university
 lem singhvi ne hi 1963 main lokapal kii kalpana kii thi, jo kanoon to ban gaya he magar aaj tak lokayukta niyukt nahin hua he
 His son Abhishek Manu Singhvi has also been an MP
 is uniwarsity se kai kanoon vid or jaj nikle hai
 Former Justice RM Lodha has also studied from Jayanarayan University
 yahaan par 47 vishyon ke vibhaag hai jisamen 125 course chalate hai
 In 2016-17, around two lakh students were admitted here
 is uniwarsity kaa darja e se ghat kar bi par aa gaya he
 Most of the class is running on the guest faculty
 pachaas fisadi pad khaali hai
 The posts of 648 teachers have been approved but only 324 teachers are regular
 kisi guest faikalti ko ek class ke liye 500 miltaa he to kisi ko 300 bhi miltaa he
 Now the government has found a new way
 puraane guest faikalti ko hataa kar unki jagah ritair prophessoron ko rakhaa jane laga he
 Where the youth should have been given jobs, but the rights of the youth are being killed by taking work from the retired people
 gaiyr shikshak main bhi bhayankar kami he
 There are 801 posts sanctioned but more than 200 posts are vacant
 2013 main is uniwarsity main bahaali hui thi magar ghotaale kaa aarope lag gaya
 The investigation of the Anti Corruption Bureau is still going on
 uniwarsity main inkaa ek cameraa bhi ban gaya he
 Many employees, including professors, have been arrested in this case
 sidinket member or vaais chancelar bhi jail ja chuke hai
 This time in the history of the university, the first female president has been elected here
 enesayuai kii kanta jwaala teacher bhale na ho, visi jail ja chuke hai magar uniwarsity main itihaas kaa bananaa jari he
 The comments hamaare sahyogi arun harsh 13 saal tak guest lekturer ke rup main padhaane vaale maakhanlaal ke ghar aae hai
 From 2001 to 2013, Makhanlal has taught economics to arts and commerce students
 ek class ke 150 rupee milte the
 Never could earn more than 7-8 thousand
 jainarayan vyas uniwarsity se hi eme or piechdi karke vahiin padhaa rahe the magar 13 saal ke baad uniwarsity ne tata kar diya
 Teaching in the hope that due to physical challenges will be permanent, but when the vacancy came in 2008, the post did not come for him
 ab ve theke par bhi nahin padhaa sakate hai
 Because the rule has changed
 jo ab ritair hoga vahi theke par padhaa sakegaa
 The Housing Board lives in a house which is its own
 do bachche hai
 She is 44 years old

 There are 18 posts approved in the Zoology Department, but here also 7 guests are teaching and five are permanent
 baaki 6 pad khaali hai
 The guest who is teaching did not get more than 25000 of the month

 Are you sure you were not talking anything on political topics, some must have been discussing, these leaders, those leaders, then how did they forget their issues
 ye to shikshakon kii baat hui, chaatro ke saath kitna khilwaad ho rahaa he
 So review the colleges in your area, talk to them, question them
 bihar ek college he langat singh kalege
 It was decided to build this college daily on July 3, 1899, when Babu Langat Singh brought money to the horse
 is din unhone ilaake ke zameendaaron ko bulaayaa tha
 Everyone openly donated land and money
 sabase zyaada yogadan langat singh kaa tha
 The building of this college is grand, it was built like Balliol College, Oxford
 indo sarsenic vaastu style main bana he
 The walls of this 117-year-old college have seen moments from one
 chemistry kii lab ke liye is college kaa apana gas plant hua karata tha
 Acharya GB Kripalani, who came in contact with Gandhiji during the Champaran Satyagraha, used to teach in this Langat Singh College
 gandhi ji bhi yahaan aa chuke hai
 First President Rajendra Prasad, Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar have also taught here
 padhai-likhaai main is college kaa naam jamaane tak rahaa, kabhi har saal yahaan se iees, ipies hua karte the, log garv se bataate the ki ales college se hai
 Naik has given this college an a grade and UGC has placed its building in the heritage category
 kya aaj langat singh kaa vaisaa itihaas he, kya muzaffarpur yaa uttar bihar kaa noujvaan dilli vishvavidhyalay chhod langat singh kalege main daakhila letaa he, kya langat singh college aaj pehla chwis he
 Spread over 59 acres, it is also visited by the college campus
 langat singh college kii website par jaakar check kiya ki yahaan par kitne pad khaali hai
 The college has 15 departments and five thousand students
 yahaan par 92 professor permanent hai magar 57 hi permanent bache hai
 The post of 35 teachers is vacant in place of adhoc or temporary professor
 website hamane check kii or apane str par pataa lagaaya to kaaphi antar mila, jo is tarah he- - Not a single professor or lecturer in Persian, Maithili, Zoology
 - zoology main 6 pad manzur hai magar sabhi pad khaali
 - There are 9 permanent posts in Chemistry but only 5 professors are teaching
 - itihaas main 7 shikshak manzur, magar 3 hi lekturer hai
 There were once 11 professors of mathematics in Langat Singh College, but at the moment only two remain as professors
 isamen se bhi ek pariksha niyantrak ban kar chale gaye hai
 That is, there is only one professor in the mathematics department of the college
 in khaali padon main koi asthaayee taur par bhi nahin padhaata he
 Many vocational courses were started in this college from 2002, such as BBA, BCA, Bachelors in Journalism etc
 inamen se kisi bhi course main permanent faikalti ke liye manzuri nahin mili he
 Teachers have been teaching here temporarily for 17-17 years, hoping to someday become permanent
 aap kalpana nahin kar sakate ki ye professor apana ghar chalaane ke liye college ke baad kya-kya karte hai
 Vocational course teacher gets 400 rupees for a class
 maheene main 20 class se zyada nahin padhaa sakate
 Many teachers said that there are only 12-15 classes a month
 college main padhaakar ve maheene main 10,000 se zyaada nahin kama pate hai
 Think with which dream Langat Singh College would have been formed in 1899 and what has happened to it by 2017
 class main jab shikshak hi nahin hai to vahaan ke chaatro ke saath kya hota hoga
 Do not think that this has happened in the last one year
 20 saal se lagaataar ho rahi andekhi ne desh ke har bade collejon kii yahi haalat kar di he
 Sanjay Sharma of the Federation of University Teachers Association of Bihar, Futa, said that Chanderdev Narayan College of Sahabganj district was the only professor for one year
 laga ki ve mazaaq kar rahe hai, phir jab vahaan ke sutron se baat kiya to pataa chalaa ki vahaan ke chaatr to kai saal se yah mazaaq jhel rahe hai
 Chandev Narayan College was established in 1969
 yahaan 3500 chaatr padhate hai magar 2016 se haal tak ek hi professor the
 There were 8 professors here in 2014, increased to 5 in 2015, only one left in 2016
 ganit ke professor ke bharose yah college chalata rahaa
 Lecturer of English and Psychology was appointed here 15 days ago
 yani kul teen prophessoron ke jimme 3500 chaatro kaa bhaar
 Can three professors teach 3500 students? The post has 23 teachers
 sahibganj ke chaatro ke saath jo mazaaq ho rahaa he, us par koun hansega, khud chaatr yaa vyavastha chalaane vaale log
 They know that elections can be won without it
 chandev narayan mahavidhyalay main kuch course main asthaayee shikshakon ne padhaayaa bhi magar kam vetan ke kaaran koi nahin aata he
 Then they used to get 4950 rupees monthly
 sochie, zaraa sochie, kam bhi sochie yaa mat hi sochie ki 5000 se kam main koi college main padhayega
 It was also found that the condition of colleges in rural areas is worse
 biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ne 2017-18 ke liye jo bajet report rajya sarkaar ko bheji he, use dekhakar sthiti to or bhi bhayaavah nazar aati he
 Some are giving the accounts of the colleges so that the youth there can pressurize their representatives for permanent appointment
 uniwarsity ke piji department main 230 shikshak hone chahien magar 101 hi padhaa rahe hai
 In RC College, Sakra, only 4 are teaching instead of 24 teachers
 doctor esake sinha mahila kalege motihaari main 29 shikshak hone chahie magar hai sirf 7
 MJK College, Bettiah has 67 posts but only 17 teachers are posted
 ek uniwarsity kii suchi dekhakar lagata he ki jaanboojh kar padon ko nahin bharaa ja rahaa he
 Either there is no recruitment or if the process continues for many years
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki ilaake ke sabhi bade logon ko yah baat maaloom he
 Young people also know this
 magar kisi ko nahin dekha ki sabane milakar vidhayak or saansadon par dabaav daalaa ho ki college main niyuktiyaan hon, padhai thik se chale
 Now take the condition of a college in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh
 bulandshahr main do sarkari or 10 aded degree college hai, zyaadaatar collejon main teacheron kii kami he
 In 1956, Bulandshahr merchants donated a lot of land to build a DAV degree college
 us vakt shahar kaa yah akele piji college tha
 Today more than 3000 students study here but there are no teachers to teach
 40 pad manzur hai magar 20 shikshakon ke bharose kaam chal rahaa he
 Can 20 teachers teach 3000 students
 ye sabhi 20 professor 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par hi padhaa rahe hai
 That is, there is not a single permanent teacher in this college
 angrezi vibhaag ke adhyaksh to 23 saal se edock padhaa rahe hai
 His salary has increased from 2200 to 8000 in 23 years
 bees-bees saal se shikshak yahaan asthai taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Similarly, Faculty of Chemistry Department Suvidha Chaudhary has also been teaching here on Adhawk for many years
 aap soch sakate hai ki is college ke chaatro ke saath kya ho rahaa hoga
 We are creating a future or a national project to spoil the future is going on in India
 yakeen hi nahin hua jab meerut uniwarsity association ke adhyaksh professor vikaas sharma ne bataaya ki puure upi main degree collejon main saath fisadi pad khaali hai
 If there are so many vacancies which have been held so many elections, why did not all these issues ever arise
 kya kisi ko college main naukari nahin chahie thi, kya chaatro ko bagaiyr professor kii padhanaa tha
 Let's go to Rajasthan again
 yahaan ke jainarayan vyas uniwarsity kaa haal liya jise 1962 main kaayam kiya gaya tha
 It was inaugurated on 24 August 1962 by the President of India, Dr
 es
 Radhakrishnan did it
 pehle ise jodhpur uniwarsity bhi kehete the
 The list of its successful students is fantastic
 purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot, jodhpur ke saansad or kendriya krishi rajya mantri gajender singh shekhavat, purv rajya sabha saansad lem singhvi bhi isi vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr rahe hai
 It was LM Singhvi who conceived the Lokpal in 1963, which has become a law but till date the Lokayukta has not been appointed
 inke putr abhishek manu singhvi bhi saansad rahe hai
 Many law students and judges have come out of this university
 purv justise aaram lodha bhi jainarayan universti se hi padhe hai
 There are 47 subjects departments in which 125 courses run
 2016-17 main yahaan kareeb do lakh chaatro ne daakhila liya tha
 The status of this university has come down from a to B
 zyaadaatar class guest faikalti ke bharose chal rahi he
 Fifty percent of the posts are vacant
 648 shikshakon ke pad manzur kiye gaye hai magar 324 shikshak hi niyamit hai
 a guest faculty gets 500 for a class, while someone also gets 300
 ab sarkaar ne ek nayaa tarika nikaala he
 Retired professors are being replaced by old guest faculty
 kahaan to naujavaanon ko naukari di jaani chahie thi magar ritair logon se kaam lekar naujavaanon ke haq ko maaraa ja rahaa he
 There is also a severe shortage in non-teachers
 vahaan 801 pad sweekrut hai magar 200 se adhik pad khaali hai
 The university was reinstated in 2013 but the scam was alleged
 anti karpshan beuro kii jaanch abhi tak chal rahi he
 They also have a room in the university
 is maamle main professor se lekar kai karmchaaree giraftaar ho chuke hai
 Siddinket Member and Vice Chancellor have also gone to jail
 vishvavidhyalay ke itihaas main is baar yahaan pehali mahila adhyaksh chuni gai hai
 Although the Kanta Jwala teacher of NSUI, VC has gone to jail but history continues to be made in the university
 tippaniyan Our colleague Arun Harsh has come to the house of Makhanlal, who taught as a guest lecturer for 13 years
 2001 se 2013 tak maakhanlaal ne arts or commers ke chaatro ko arthshaastra padhaayaa he
 One class used to get 150 rupees
 kabhi 7-8 hazaar se zyaada nahin kama sake
 Jayanarayan Vyas was doing his MA and phd from the same university and was teaching there, but after 13 years, the university switched to Tata
 is ummid main padhaate rahe ki shaareerik chunautiyon ke kaaran permanent ho jayega lekin jab 2008 main vaikency ai to unke liye post hi nahin nikali
 Now they cannot teach even on contract
 kyonki niyam badal gaya he
 Those who retire now will be able to teach on contract
 houseing board ke makaan main rahete hai jo apana he
 Have two children
 44 saal umr ho chuki he
 Someone told that there are several hundred vacancies of teachers in Allahabad University
 zoology department main to 18 post manzur hai magar yahaan bhi 7 guest padhaa rahe hai or paanch permanent
 The remaining 6 posts are empty
 jo guest padhaa rahaa he use maheene kaa 25000 se adhik nahin mila
 After this program, teachers have mailed from place to place, saying that my report could have been even more frightening, it is lacking in it, it is not a matter of funded colleges, how in private colleges five thousand to eight Thousand has been kept for teaching people, it has not come yet
 kya vaaki aap raajnneetik vishyon par kuch bhi nahin bol rahe the, kuch to charchaa karte hi honge, ye netaa wo netaa, to phir apane muddon ko kaise bhul gaye
 It was a matter of teachers, how much messing is happening with the students
 to apane-apane ilaake ke college kaa gauge lijie, unki baat kiijie, unhen lekar sawaal kiijie
 The walls of this 117-year-old college have seen moments from one
 chemistry kii lab ke liye is college kaa apana gas plant hua karata tha
 Acharya GB Kripalani, who came in contact with Gandhiji during the Champaran Satyagraha, used to teach in this Langat Singh College
 gandhi ji bhi yahaan aa chuke hai
 First President Rajendra Prasad, Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar have also taught here
 padhai-likhaai main is college kaa naam jamaane tak rahaa, kabhi har saal yahaan se iees, ipies hua karte the, log garv se bataate the ki ales college se hai
 Naik has given this college an a grade and UGC has placed its building in the heritage category
 kya aaj langat singh kaa vaisaa itihaas he, kya muzaffarpur yaa uttar bihar kaa noujvaan dilli vishvavidhyalay chhod langat singh kalege main daakhila letaa he, kya langat singh college aaj pehla chwis he
 Spread over 59 acres, it is also visited by the college campus
 langat singh college kii website par jaakar check kiya ki yahaan par kitne pad khaali hai
 The college has 15 departments and five thousand students
 yahaan par 92 professor permanent hai magar 57 hi permanent bache hai
 The post of 35 teachers is vacant in place of adhoc or temporary professor
 website hamane check kii or apane str par pataa lagaaya to kaaphi antar mila, jo is tarah he- - Not a single professor or lecturer in Persian, Maithili, Zoology
 - zoology main 6 pad manzur hai magar sabhi pad khaali
 - There are 9 permanent posts in Chemistry but only 5 professors are teaching
 - itihaas main 7 shikshak manzur, magar 3 hi lekturer hai
 There were once 11 professors of mathematics in Langat Singh College, but at the moment only two remain as professors
 isamen se bhi ek pariksha niyantrak ban kar chale gaye hai
 That is, there is only one professor in the mathematics department of the college
 in khaali padon main koi asthaayee taur par bhi nahin padhaata he
 Many vocational courses were started in this college from 2002, such as BBA, BCA, Bachelors in Journalism etc
 inamen se kisi bhi course main permanent faikalti ke liye manzuri nahin mili he
 Teachers have been teaching here temporarily for 17-17 years, hoping to someday become permanent
 aap kalpana nahin kar sakate ki ye professor apana ghar chalaane ke liye college ke baad kya-kya karte hai
 Vocational course teacher gets 400 rupees for a class
 maheene main 20 class se zyada nahin padhaa sakate
 Many teachers said that there are only 12-15 classes a month
 college main padhaakar ve maheene main 10,000 se zyaada nahin kama pate hai
 Think with which dream Langat Singh College would have been formed in 1899 and what has happened to it by 2017
 class main jab shikshak hi nahin hai to vahaan ke chaatro ke saath kya hota hoga
 Do not think that this has happened in the last one year
 20 saal se lagaataar ho rahi andekhi ne desh ke har bade collejon kii yahi haalat kar di he
 Sanjay Sharma of the Federation of University Teachers Association of Bihar, Futa, said that Chanderdev Narayan College of Sahabganj district was the only professor for one year
 laga ki ve mazaaq kar rahe hai, phir jab vahaan ke sutron se baat kiya to pataa chalaa ki vahaan ke chaatr to kai saal se yah mazaaq jhel rahe hai
 Chandev Narayan College was established in 1969
 yahaan 3500 chaatr padhate hai magar 2016 se haal tak ek hi professor the
 There were 8 professors here in 2014, increased to 5 in 2015, only one left in 2016
 ganit ke professor ke bharose yah college chalata rahaa
 Lecturer of English and Psychology was appointed here 15 days ago
 yani kul teen prophessoron ke jimme 3500 chaatro kaa bhaar
 Can three professors teach 3500 students? The post has 23 teachers
 sahibganj ke chaatro ke saath jo mazaaq ho rahaa he, us par koun hansega, khud chaatr yaa vyavastha chalaane vaale log
 They know that elections can be won without it
 chandev narayan mahavidhyalay main kuch course main asthaayee shikshakon ne padhaayaa bhi magar kam vetan ke kaaran koi nahin aata he
 Then they used to get 4950 rupees monthly
 sochie, zaraa sochie, kam bhi sochie yaa mat hi sochie ki 5000 se kam main koi college main padhayega
 It was also found that the condition of colleges in rural areas is worse
 biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ne 2017-18 ke liye jo bajet report rajya sarkaar ko bheji he, use dekhakar sthiti to or bhi bhayaavah nazar aati he
 Some are giving the accounts of the colleges so that the youth there can pressurize their representatives for permanent appointment
 uniwarsity ke piji department main 230 shikshak hone chahien magar 101 hi padhaa rahe hai
 In RC College, Sakra, only 4 are teaching instead of 24 teachers
 doctor esake sinha mahila kalege motihaari main 29 shikshak hone chahie magar hai sirf 7
 MJK College, Bettiah has 67 posts but only 17 teachers are posted
 ek uniwarsity kii suchi dekhakar lagata he ki jaanboojh kar padon ko nahin bharaa ja rahaa he
 Either there is no recruitment or if the process continues for many years
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki ilaake ke sabhi bade logon ko yah baat maaloom he
 Young people also know this
 magar kisi ko nahin dekha ki sabane milakar vidhayak or saansadon par dabaav daalaa ho ki college main niyuktiyaan hon, padhai thik se chale
 Now take the condition of a college in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh
 bulandshahr main do sarkari or 10 aded degree college hai, zyaadaatar collejon main teacheron kii kami he
 In 1956, Bulandshahr merchants donated a lot of land to build a DAV degree college
 us vakt shahar kaa yah akele piji college tha
 Today, more than 3000 students study here, but there are no teachers to teach
 40 pad manzur hai magar 20 shikshakon ke bharose kaam chal rahaa he
 Can 20 teachers teach 3000 students
 ye sabhi 20 professor 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par hi padhaa rahe hai
 That is, there is not a single permanent teacher in this college
 angrezi vibhaag ke adhyaksh to 23 saal se edock padhaa rahe hai
 His salary has increased from 2200 to 8000 in 23 years
 bees-bees saal se shikshak yahaan asthai taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Similarly, Faculty of Chemistry Department Suvidha Chaudhary has also been teaching here on Adhawk for many years
 aap soch sakate hai ki is college ke chaatro ke saath kya ho rahaa hoga
 We are creating a future or a national project to spoil the future is going on in India
 yakeen hi nahin hua jab meerut uniwarsity association ke adhyaksh professor vikaas sharma ne bataaya ki puure upi main degree collejon main saath fisadi pad khaali hai
 If there are so many vacancies which have been held so many elections, why did not all these issues ever arise
 kya kisi ko college main naukari nahin chahie thi, kya chaatro ko bagaiyr professor kii padhanaa tha
 Let's go to Rajasthan again

 Siddinket Member and Vice Chancellor have also gone to jail

 On the website of Langat Singh College, checked how many posts are vacant here
 college main 15 vibhaag hai or paanch hazaar chaatr hai
 There are 92 Professor Permanentes here, but 57 are Permanente
 35 shikshakon kaa post khaali hai jinke sthaan par edock yaa asthaayee professor padhaate hai
 We checked the website and found out at our level, there was a lot of difference, which is like this- - farsi, maithili, zoology main ek bhi professor yaa lekturer nahin
 - 6 posts are approved in Zoology but all posts are empty
 - chemistry main 9 permanent post he magar 5 professor hi padhaa rahe hai
 7 teachers are approved in history, but 3 are lecturers
 langat singh college main ganit ke kabhi 11 professor hua karte the, lekin is vakt do hi professor rah gaye hai
 Out of this, he has gone on to become an exam controller
 yani college ke ganit vibhaag main ek hi professor hai
 In these empty posts, no one teaches temporarily
 2002 se is college main kai vokational course shuru kiye gaye, jaise bibie, bisie, bachalers in jarnalism aadi
 In none of these courses is the approval for permanent faculty approved
 17-17 saal se yahaan shikshak asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe hai, is ummid main ki kisi din permanent ho jaaenge
 You cannot imagine what these professors do after college to run their own home
 vokational course ke teacher ko ek class ke liye 400 rupaya milte hai
 Can not teach more than 20 classes in a month
 kai shikshakon ne bataaya ki maheene main adhikt 12-15 class hi ho paati hai
 They do not earn more than 10,000 a month by teaching in college
 aap sochie ki kis sapane ke saath 1899 main langat singh college bana hoga or 2017 tak uski kya haalat ho gai he
 When there are no teachers in the class, what will happen to the students there
 yah mat sochiega ki yah pichley ek saal main hua he
 For 20 years, continuous neglect has made the condition of every major college in the country
 federation of uniwarsity teachers association of bihar, phuta ke sanjay sharma ne bataaya ki sahibganj zile ke chanderdev narayan mahavidhyalay main ek saal tak to ek hi professor the
 It seemed that they were joking, then when i spoke to the sources there, it was found that the students there have been having this joke for many years
 1969 main chandev narayan mahavidhyalay kii sthapana hui thi
 There are 3500 students studying here but from 2016 till recently there was only one professor
 2014 main yahaan 8 professor the, 2015 main 5 ho gaye, 2016 main ek hi bache
 This college continued to rely on the professor of mathematics
 15 din pehle yahaan angrezi or manovigyaan ke lekturer kii niyukti hui
 That means a weight of 3500 students responsible for a total of three professors
 kya teen professor 3500 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai? post he 23 shikshakon kii
 Who will laugh at the joke being made with the students of Sahebganj, the students themselves or the people running the system
 unhen pataa he chunaav bina iske bhi jeeta ja saktaa he
 Temporary teachers also taught in some courses at Chandev Narayan College but none comes due to low salary
 tab unhen 4950 rupaya masik miltaa tha
 Think, just think, think less or do not think that under 5000 someone will teach in college
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki gramin ilaakon ke collejon kii haalat to or bhi kharaab he
 BR Ambedkar University's budget report for 2017-18 sent to the state government, the situation looks even more frightening
 kuch collejon kaa hisaab de de rahe hai taaki vahaan ke noujvaan sthaayee niyukti ke liye apane pratinidhiyon par dabaav daal saken
 The university's PG department should have 230 teachers, but only 101 are teaching
 aarasi college, sakara main 24 shikshakon kii jagah maatr 4 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Doctor SK Sinha Female College Motihari should have 29 teachers but only 7
 mjeke college, betia main 67 pad hai magar 17 shikshak hi tainaat hai Looking at the list of a university, it seems that the posts are not being filled deliberately
 yaa to bhartee nahin hoti yaa hoti he to kai saal tak prakriya hi chalati rahati he
 Surprisingly, all the big people of the area know this
 naujavaanon ko bhi yah baat maaloom he
 But nobody has seen that everyone has put pressure on the mlas and mps to make appointments in the college, studies should go well
 uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr ke ek college kaa haal ab lete hai
 Bulandshahr has two government and 10 aided degree colleges, most of the colleges are short of teachers
 1956 main diavi degree college banane ke liye bulandshahr ke vyapaariyon ne khub daan diya, zamin di
 At that time it was the only PG college in the city
 aaj yahaan 3000 se adhik chaatr to padhate hai magar padhaane vaale shikshak nahin hai
 40 posts are acceptable, but work is going on with 20 teachers
 kya 20 shikshak 3000 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai
 All these 20 professors have been teaching only temporarily for 20-20 years
 yani is kalege main ek bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 The Chairman of the English Department has been teaching Adhoc for 23 years
 23 saal main inaki selary 2200 se badhkar 8000 ho gai he
 Teachers have been teaching here temporarily for twenty years
 usee tarah chemistry vibhaag kii adhyaksh suvidha choudhary bhi kai saal se yaha edock par padhaa rahi hai
 You might wonder what would be happening to the students of this college
 ham bhavishya bana rahe hai yaa bhavishya bigaadane kaa rashtriya project chal rahaa he bharat main
 Unbelievable when Professor Vikas Sharma, President of Meerut University Association, said that sixty percent posts in degree colleges are vacant all over UP
 agar itane pad khaali hai jo phir itane chunaav ho chuke, kabhi ye sab mudda kyon nahin bana
 Did nobody want a job in college, did the students have to study without a professor
 phir se rajasthan chalate he
 Here took the condition of Jayanarayan Vyas University which was established in 1962
 iskaa udghaatan 24 agast, 1962 ko bharat ke raashtrapati dow
 s
 radhakrishnan ne kiya tha
 Earlier it was also called Jodhpur University
 iske kaamyaab chaatro kii suchi shandaar he
 Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Jodhpur MP and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajender Singh Shekhawat, former Rajya Sabha MP LM Singhvi have also been students of this university
 lem singhvi ne hi 1963 main lokapal kii kalpana kii thi, jo kanoon to ban gaya he magar aaj tak lokayukta niyukt nahin hua he
 His son Abhishek Manu Singhvi has also been an MP
 is uniwarsity se kai kanoon vid or jaj nikle hai
 Former Justice RM Lodha has also studied from Jayanarayan University
 yahaan par 47 vishyon ke vibhaag hai jisamen 125 course chalate hai
 In 2016-17, around two lakh students were admitted here
 is uniwarsity kaa darja e se ghat kar bi par aa gaya he
 Most of the class is running on the guest faculty
 pachaas fisadi pad khaali hai
 The posts of 648 teachers have been approved but only 324 teachers are regular
 kisi guest faikalti ko ek class ke liye 500 miltaa he to kisi ko 300 bhi miltaa he
 Now the government has found a new way
 puraane guest faikalti ko hataa kar unki jagah ritair prophessoron ko rakhaa jane laga he
 Where the youth should have been given jobs, but the rights of the youth are being killed by taking work from the retired people
 gaiyr shikshak main bhi bhayankar kami he
 There are 801 posts sanctioned but more than 200 posts are vacant
 2013 main is uniwarsity main bahaali hui thi magar ghotaale kaa aarope lag gaya
 The investigation of the Anti Corruption Bureau is still going on
 uniwarsity main inkaa ek cameraa bhi ban gaya he
 Many employees, including professors, have been arrested in this case
 sidinket member or vaais chancelar bhi jail ja chuke hai
 This time in the history of the university, the first female president has been elected here
 enesayuai kii kanta jwaala teacher bhale na ho, visi jail ja chuke hai magar uniwarsity main itihaas kaa bananaa jari he
 The comments hamaare sahyogi arun harsh 13 saal tak guest lekturer ke rup main padhaane vaale maakhanlaal ke ghar aae hai
 From 2001 to 2013, Makhanlal has taught economics to arts and commerce students
 ek class ke 150 rupee milte the
 Never could earn more than 7-8 thousand
 jainarayan vyas uniwarsity se hi eme or piechdi karke vahiin padhaa rahe the magar 13 saal ke baad uniwarsity ne tata kar diya
 Teaching in the hope that due to physical challenges will be permanent, but when the vacancy came in 2008, the post did not come for him
 ab ve theke par bhi nahin padhaa sakate hai
 Because the rule has changed
 jo ab ritair hoga vahi theke par padhaa sakegaa
 The Housing Board lives in a house which is its own
 do bachche hai
 She is 44 years old
 kisi ne bataaya ki elahabaad uniwarsity main bhi kai sau pad shikshakon ke khaali hai
 There are 18 posts approved in the Zoology Department, but here also 7 guests are teaching and five are permanent
 baaki 6 pad khaali hai
 The guest who is teaching did not get more than 25000 of the month
 is kaarykram ke baad jagah-jagah se shikshakon ne mail kiya he, kaha ki meri report or bhi bhayaavah ho sakati thi, isamen ye kami he wo kami he, vitt poshit kalege kii baat nahin he, privet kalejon main kis tarah paanch hazaar se aath hazaar par logon ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa gaya he ye abhi tak nahin ai
 Are you sure you were not talking anything on political topics, some must have been discussing, these leaders, those leaders, then how did they forget their issues
 ye to shikshakon kii baat hui, chaatro ke saath kitna khilwaad ho rahaa he
 So review the colleges in your area, talk to them, question them
 - farsi, maithili, zoology main ek bhi professor yaa lekturer nahin
 - 6 posts are approved in Zoology but all posts are empty
 - chemistry main 9 permanent post he magar 5 professor hi padhaa rahe hai

 You cannot imagine what these professors do after college to run their own home

 Are you sure you were not talking anything on political topics, some must have been discussing, these leaders, those leaders, then how did they forget their issues
 ye to shikshakon kii baat hui, chaatro ke saath kitna khilwaad ho rahaa he
 So review the colleges in your area, talk to them, question them
 1969 main chandev narayan mahavidhyalay kii sthapana hui thi
 There are 3500 students studying here but from 2016 till recently there was only one professor
 2014 main yahaan 8 professor the, 2015 main 5 ho gaye, 2016 main ek hi bache
 This college continued to rely on the professor of mathematics
 15 din pehle yahaan angrezi or manovigyaan ke lekturer kii niyukti hui
 That means a weight of 3500 students responsible for a total of three professors
 kya teen professor 3500 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai? post he 23 shikshakon kii
 Who will laugh at the joke being made with the students of Sahebganj, the students themselves or the people running the system
 unhen pataa he chunaav bina iske bhi jeeta ja saktaa he
 Temporary teachers also taught in some courses at Chandev Narayan College but none comes due to low salary
 tab unhen 4950 rupaya masik miltaa tha
 Think, just think, think less or do not think that under 5000 someone will teach in college
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki gramin ilaakon ke collejon kii haalat to or bhi kharaab he
 BR Ambedkar University's budget report for 2017-18 sent to the state government, the situation looks even more frightening
 kuch collejon kaa hisaab de de rahe hai taaki vahaan ke noujvaan sthaayee niyukti ke liye apane pratinidhiyon par dabaav daal saken
 The university's PG department should have 230 teachers, but only 101 are teaching
 aarasi college, sakara main 24 shikshakon kii jagah maatr 4 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Doctor SK Sinha Female College Motihari should have 29 teachers but only 7
 mjeke college, betia main 67 pad hai magar 17 shikshak hi tainaat hai Looking at the list of a university, it seems that the posts are not being filled deliberately
 yaa to bhartee nahin hoti yaa hoti he to kai saal tak prakriya hi chalati rahati he

 uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr ke ek college kaa haal ab lete hai
 Bulandshahr has two government and 10 aided degree colleges, most of the colleges are short of teachers
 1956 main diavi degree college banane ke liye bulandshahr ke vyapaariyon ne khub daan diya, zamin di
 At that time it was the only PG college in the city
 aaj yahaan 3000 se adhik chaatr to padhate hai magar padhaane vaale shikshak nahin hai
 40 posts are acceptable, but work is going on with 20 teachers
 kya 20 shikshak 3000 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai
 All these 20 professors have been teaching only temporarily for 20-20 years
 yani is kalege main ek bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 The Chairman of the English Department has been teaching Adhoc for 23 years
 23 saal main inaki selary 2200 se badhkar 8000 ho gai he
 Teachers have been teaching here temporarily for twenty years

 You might wonder what would be happening to the students of this college
 ham bhavishya bana rahe hai yaa bhavishya bigaadane kaa rashtriya project chal rahaa he bharat main
 Unbelievable when Professor Vikas Sharma, President of Meerut University Association, said that sixty percent posts in degree colleges are vacant all over UP
 agar itane pad khaali hai jo phir itane chunaav ho chuke, kabhi ye sab mudda kyon nahin bana
 Did nobody want a job in college, did the students have to study without a professor
