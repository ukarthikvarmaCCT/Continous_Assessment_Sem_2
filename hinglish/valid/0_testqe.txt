 Gatfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a German philosopher, scientist, mathematician, diplomat, physicist, historian, politician, authority
 unka puraa naam 'gotafreet wilhelm phone libnits' tha
 He has a prominent place in the history of mathematics and the history of philosophy
 labnij kaa janm germany ke lipjig naamak sthaan par pehali july 1646 ko hua tha
 Her father was a professor of Moral Philosophy
 san 1652 i
 main chha varsh kii avasthaa main libnij ko lipjig sthit nikolai skool main padhane ke liye bheja gaya
 But unfortunately the same year his father died
 iske kaaran uski padhai main kaaphi vyavdhaan aane laga
 He sometimes went to school and then could never go
 ab vah praaia swadhyay dwaara vidya-arjan karne laga
 He received a lot of historical information from his father
 iske kaaran uski abhiruchi itihaas ke adhyayan main kaaphi bad gayi thi
 Apart from this, he had a great interest in learning various languages
 aath varsh kii avasthaa main usne latin bhashaa sikh lee
 At the age of twelve, he learned Greek
 latin main usne kavitaayen bhi likhni shuru kar deen
 At the age of 15, Leibniz entered Leipzig University as a law student
 is vishvavidhyalay main pratham do varsh usne jaikaub yomasius ke nirdesan main darshanashastra ke gahan adhyayan main vyateet kiye
 During this time, he got information about those ancient thinkers who worked to bring revolution in the development of science and philosophy
 in mahaan vichaarkon main shaamil the fransis bacon, kepler, campanela tathaa galileo ityadi
 Now Leibniz's interest turned to the study of mathematics
 is uddeshy se usne jena nivasee irhard vigel se sampark kiya
 Weigel was considered a great mathematician of that period
 kuch samay tak vigel ke adheen ganit kaa adhyayan karne ke baad usne agle teen varshon tak kanoon kaa adhyayan kiya
 He then submitted an application for the degree of Doctor of Law
 parantu umr kam hone ke kaaran lipjig vishvavidhyalay ne use isaki anumati pradaan nahin kii
 Therefore, he left the University of Leipzig and submitted an application for the degree of Doctor of Law at Alt Dorf University
 yahan uskaa aavedan sweekaar kar liya gaya tathaa san 1666 i
 ke navambar main use doctor of lau kii degree pradaan kii gayi
 Although Leibniz had originally been a student of law, he had a high interest in various subjects of science
 san 1669 i
 main usne jaikaub thomasius ko ek patr likhaa jisamen bataaya ki arestu dwaara pratipaadit bhautikee ke siddhant prakritik kriyakalapon kii vyavastha santojajanak dhang se karte hai
 But these principles still need to be amended
 san 1671 i
 main libnij ne `hypothesis physica nauva' naamak sheershak se apana ek shodhpatr prakashit kiya jisamen usne vichaar vyakt kiya ki sabhi khagoleey kriyakalapon main ether kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 It was only in 1671 that he went to Paris in connection with his research and met prominent scientists like Antoine Arnold, Nicolas Mallebranke and Christian Hoygen
 usne ganit, yantra shaastra, optics, hydrostatics, neumatics tathaa nautical science jaise vishyon se sambandhit anek shodh patr prakashit kiye
 The most prominent of these researches was the invention of the 'calculating machine'
 is yantra ke dwaara anek prakaar kii gananaayen kii ja sakati thim
 This machine was presented by Leibniz to the 'academy des Sciences' in Paris and the 'royal Society' of London
 iske falswaroop libnij ko san 1673 main royal sosayadi kaa sadsy manonith kiya gaya
 Similarly, in 1700, he was also appointed as a foreign member of the Academy Press Sciences
 libnij vaigyanik shodh ke prati swayan to puri tarah samarpit tha hi, usne anya logon ko bhi iske liye prerit kiya
 With this aim in mind, he founded the 'berlin Academy' on 11 July 1700 AD
 is academy kaa vah pratham adhyaksh chunaa gaya
 The activity of this academy and the number of its members increased quadrupled day and night
 ganit ke kshetra main libnij dwaara kiye gayi shodh kaaphi mahatvapurn rahe hai
 He contributed significantly to the development of calculus
 haalanki calculas kii shuruyaat kaaphi pehle hi unani ganitagyon dwaara vrutt ke kshetrafal tathaa belan, shanku evam golon ke aaytan kii gananaa hetu kii ja chuki thi, parantu vah calculas bilkul praarambhik str kaa tha
 The research done by Leibniz towards the development of calculus proved to be milestones
 usne avkalan tathaa samakalan sambandhi jo sanket shuru kiye unka upyog aaj tak kiya ja rahaa he
 Leibniz's contribution was not only in the field of science but also in the field of spirituality and philosophy
 is disha main uske dwaara adhikansh kaary san 1685 se san 1716 i
 ke bich kiye gayi
 He completed the work of writing his philosophy of philosophy in 1686 AD when he completed the writing of a manuscript called 'discourse Metaphysic'
 parantu durbhagyavash uske dwaara likhit is pandulipi kaa prakaashan uski mrityu ke lagbhag 130 varshon ke baad san 1846 main kiya ja sakaa
 During his lifetime, only one of his works was published, entitled 'essage de theodici surla bonte de deula liberty de l'himme'
 yah pustak san 1710 i
 main do khandon main prakashit hui thi
 Although the books written by Leibniz were not published much, the research papers written by him continued to be published in many major journals from time to time
 jin patrikaon main uske shedh patr praaia prakashit hote the, unamem pramukh thim- lipjig se prakashit hone vaala 'acta iruditoram' tathaa paris se prakashit hone vaala 'jarnal di sawants'
 His research papers published in these leading journals earned him a very good reputation in the scientific world
 libnij ne apane samakaleen darshanikon tathaa vaigyanikon ko jo patr likhe the ve bhi shodh str ke the
 For example, in the letters he wrote to Samuel Clarke, his theories regarding God, soul, time and place etc
 were discussed in detail
 in patron main uske dwaara jo vichaar vyakt kiye gayi the ve sab ke sab ucch str ke darshan se sambandhit maaloom padate hai
 Most of Leibniz's works were published only after his death
 udaahranarth san 1765 i
 main lipjig se 'bouvioaks esse sur el intedment human' naamak pustak prakashit hui
 In 1718, a book entitled 'principles dila Nature at della Grace Founds in Raison' was published
 libnij ke jivan kaa antim kuch samay bahut hi dayaneey evam dukhad sthiti main gujara
 From 1692 to 1716, he was often diseased
 ant kaal main uski sud lene vaala yaa seva-sushrusha karne vaala koi nahin tha
 Finally, he died on November 14, 1716, at a place called Hanover

 Aisha Bint Abu Bakr was one of the wives of Hazrat Muhammad
 islamic lekhan main, quran main mohammad kii patniyon ke vivaran ke anusaar, uskaa naam aksar "um ul mominin" "vishvaasiyon kii maa" sheershak se upsarg kiya jaataa he
 The first Khalifa of Islam was the daughter of Abu Bakr
 mohammad ke jivan or unki mrityu ke baad donon ke praarambhik islamic itihaas main aisha kii ahm bhoomika thi
 In Sunni tradition, Aisha is considered a scholar and inquisitive
 unhone mohammad ke sandesh ke failaav main yogadan diya or unki mrityu ke 44 saal baad muslim samudaay kii seva kii
 He is also known for his description of the 2210 Hadith, on matters related to Muhammad's personal life, but also on subjects such as heritage, pilgrimage and eschatology
 kavita or chikitsa samet vibhinn vishyon main unki buddhi or gyaan, al-juhari or unke chaatr urv ebn al- jubayr jaise shuruaati chamakdaar logon dwaara atyadhik prashansa kii gai thi
 His father, Abu Bakr, became the first caliph to succeed Muhammad, and was succeeded by Umar two years later
 tisare khalif uthman ke samay, aaisha ke khilaaf vipaksh main ek pramukh bhoomika thi jo unke khilaaf badi, haalanki vah yaa to unki hatya ke liye jimmedaar logon ke saath sahamat nahin thim or na hi ali kii party ke saath
 During Ali's reign, she wanted to avenge Uthman's death, which she attempted to do in the Battle of the Camel
 unhone apane oont ke peeche bhaashan or pramukh sainikon ko dekar yuddh main bhaag liya
 She lost the battle, but her involvement and determination left a lasting impression
 baad main, vah bees saal se adhik samay tak madina main chupchaap rahati thi, raajnneeti main koi hissaa nahin leti thi, ali se milakar ban gai or khalif muavia kaa virodh nahin kiya
 Most sources of traditional hadith state that Aisha was married to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she lived in her parents' house until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham, when The marriage ended with Muthan, 53, in Medina
 aadhunik samay main kai vidwaanon dwaara is samayrekha ko chunauti di gai he
 Shia generally has a negative view of Aisha
 unhone oont kii ladaai main apane khalipha ke dauraan ali se ghrinaa karne or use apamaanit karne kaa aarope lagaaya, jab usne basra main ali kii sena se purushon se ladaa
 Aisha was born in late 613 or early 614
 vah umm ruman or mukka ke abu bakar kii beti thim, mohammad ke sabase bharosemand saathi do
 Aisha was the third and youngest wife of Muhammad
 koi strot aaisha ke bachapan ke varshon ke bare main zyada jaankaree nahin detaa he
 The idea of matching Aisha with Muhammad was suggested by Khwala bint Hakim
 iske baad, jubir ebn mutim ke saath aaisha ke vivaah ke sambandh main pichley samjhaute ko aam sahmati se alag kar diya gaya tha
 Abu Bakr was previously unsure "as to the propriety or legitimacy of marrying his daughter to his 'brother'"
 " british itihaaskaar wiliam montgomeri wat ne suzav diya ki mohammad ne abu bakar ke saath apane sambandhon ko majboot karne kii aashaa kii thi; sambandhon ko sudrudh karnaa aamtaur par arab samskruti main vivaah ke aadhaar ke rup main kaary karata he
 See also: Criticism of Muhammad, Islam, and Children § Marriage, and Child Marriage Aisha's age at the time of her marriage to Muhammad has been of interest since the early days of Islam, and references to her age are frequent by early historians
 sunni shaastra ke haddees ke sutron ke mutabik, aisha chah yaa saat saal kii thi jab shaadi ke saath mohammad se shaadi kar lee gai thi, jab tak vah nau yaa das saal kii umr tak nahin pahunch pai jiskaa arth he kai paryvekshakon dwaara yah ingit karne ke liye ki vah is umr main yuvavastha main pahunchi thim
 For example, Sahih al-bukhari said that Aisha heard that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and that she completed her marriage when she was nine years old, and then she lived with him for nine years
 
 sahahih al bukhari, 7:62:64 Recording Aisha's age in the Hadith collection came a few centuries after the Prophet's death, as the Hadith records of early Islam through a verified unbroken series of reliable witnesses
 is sambandh main haddees sahih sthiti ke saath sangrah se aate hai
 However, some other traditional sources disagree
 ebn hisham ne mohammad kii apni jeevani main likhaa tha ki vah samaapti par das saal kii ho sakati hai
 Ibn Hisham wrote on the basis of his biography on the lost work of Ibn Ishaq even two hundred years after Muhammad, who was born 72 years after Muhammad's death
 isha ko shaadi main nau saal kii umr main, or ebn khallikaan or ebn saad al-bagdadi donon ne samaapti par baarah ke rup main darj kiya tha, baad main unke strot hisham ebn urava 
 Child marriage was not uncommon in many places at the time, Arabs included
 yah aksar raajnneetik uddeshyon kii seva karata tha, or aaisha kii mohammad se shaadi kaa raajnneetik arth tha
 Muslim writers who calculate Aisha's age based on more detailed information about her sister Asma estimate that she was over thirteen and probably between seventeen and nineteen at the time of their marriage
 ek irani islamic vidwaan or itihaaskaar mohammad niknaam arbhahi ne aaisha kii umr nirdhaarit karne ke liye chah alag-alag drushtikon par vichaar kiya he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki vah apane kishoron ke kishoron main vyast thim
 Using Fatima's age as a reference point, Lahore Ahmadiyya movement scholar Muhammad Ali has estimated that Aisha was more than ten years old at the time of marriage and more than fifteen years old at the time of its completion
 america itihaaskaar denis spelberg ne aisha kii comarya, vivaah kii umr or umr ke dauraan islamic sahitya kii samiksha kii he jab shaadi samaapt ho gai thi or anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki aisha ke yuvaaon ko uski comarya ke bare main koi andeh nahin chhodane ke liye atiranjit kiya gaya ho saktaa he
 Spellberg says, "aisha's age is a major pre-occupation in Ibn Saad where her marriage varies from six to seven, with nine appearing stable at the end of her marriage as her age
" " vah paigambar kii ebn hisham kii jeevani main ek apwaad bataati he, jo bataati he ki jab esha 10 saal kii thi, to is baat ke saath unki samiksha kaa saransh diya gaya ki "dulhan kii umr ke in vishisht sandarbhon main aisha kii purv-menariyal sthiti ko majboot kiya gaya he or, jaahir he, unki comarya
 They also suggest the diversity of Aisha's age in the historical record
 " praarambhik musalamaanon ne aisha ke yuvaaon ko unki comarya kaa pradarshan karne or isliye mohammad kii dulhan ke rup main unki upyuktata ke rup main mana
 This issue of her virginity was very important to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of Muhammad's succession
 in samarthakon ne mana ki mohammad kii ekmaatr kunvaari patni ke rup main, aisha kaa divine iraadaa unke liye tha, or isliye bahes ke bare main sabase vishwasaneey

 Nannayya Bhatt: is called the 'adikavi' of Andhra literature because the original portion of the Andhra Mahabharata composed by him is considered to be the first poem in the available literature of Telugu
 inke pehle ke jo footkar geet mili, ve bhashaa or chand kii drushti se 'deshi paddati' ke anusaar hai jo sanskrit main pratipaadit lakshan ke anusaar nahin hai or is kaaran panditon ke aadar par paatr nahin hue
 Nannayya created the epic epic, which is mainly of the 'marg' method
 jab jain dharm kaa prachaar dakshin main joro se ho rahaa tha chod raja vaidic dharm kii raksha ke liye katibaddh hue
 Mahabharata began to be paralyzed in Tamil associations

 Accordingly, Nannayya initiated the creation of the Andhra Mahabharata, based on the Sanskrit Mahabharata, as a multiple translation
 nannayy ne apni rachana main sanskrit shabdon kaa prayog usee reeti se kiya jo us samay andhra praant main hota tha
 Tadbhav and indigenous words which were in the behavior of the public, also assumed them as a refined form
 kuch sanskrit chhandon ko lekar yatimaitri tathaa prasmaitri ke niyamon ke anusaar likhaa or kannada kaavyon main paae janevaale anek prashast chhandon ko bhi liya
 In the creation of the Mahabharata, Nannay got great help from a friend named Narayan Bhatt, who Nannayya himself mentioned in the preface of his treatise
 champu kii tarah chote-chote gadhy ke ansh bhi inaki rachanaaon main milte hai jo praaia: neeras vishay ko hi jataate hai
 Nannayya translated the Adi Parva and Sabha Parvas in full and Aranya Parv to some degree
 yadhyapi andhra mahabharat sthool rup se anuwaad hi he, nannayy ne ras or auchity kii drushti se kuch anshon ko sankshepat: or kuch anshon ko badhaakar likhaa jisase andhra mahabharat swatantra kavy sa prathit hota he
 His poetry features 'prasannakathakalitarthayukti', 'aksharmitya', 'nanaruchirartha Suktisampati', etc
 inaki style main tatsam shabd or sanskrit samaason kii bahulata he arthath do tihaai sanskrit or shesh tadbhav tathaa deshy shabd yani telegu shabd hai
 Nannayya created a grammar in the Telugu language called 'andhra Vardhchintamani' by trending in the task of scouring words
 vyakaran shaastra kii parampara ke anusaar vah pratham andhra vyakaran sanskrit sutron main likhaa gaya
 For this reason, Nannayya proved not only the orthodox of Andhra, but also the first grammarian of Andhra and adorned against 'vaganushasan'
 ajtak jitne andhra kavi hue un sabane nannayy ko adikavi maanakar unki prashansa kii
 It is said that other texts composed by Nannayya are 'indrasenvijay' and 'chamundika Vilas' but there is a difference of opinion about the authorship of these texts
 mahakavi nannayy mahabharat kaa andhrikaran puraa na kar sake
 The poet king died

 On the other hand, Veerashaivism also started raising its head which does not recognize the authenticity of Vedas

 hindi–urdu vivaad bhartiya upmahadweep main 19veen sadi main armbh hua bhashaai vivaad he
 Some of the basic questions of this dispute were - what should be the form of the language of North India and north-western India, what language / script is used in government work, Hindi and Urdu are two forms of the same language or are different
 Hindi and Urdu are called as the standing dialect of the Hindi language and it is the language of about 45% of the population of India which is variously known as Hindi, Hindustani and Urdu
 vastav main hindi–urdu vivaad angreji kaal main shuru hua tha or britani shashan ne pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se is vivaad ko badhaane main madad kii
 In this sequence, after the end of British rule, Urdu was declared the official language of Pakistan and Hindi was the official language of India
 vartmaan samay main kuch muslimon ke anusaar hinduon ne urdu ko parityakt kiya jabaki kuch hinduon kaa vishwaas he ki muslim raaj ke dauraan urdu ko kritrim rup se janit kiya gaya
 Hindi and Urdu are two different literary forms of Khadi dialect of Hindi
 khadi boli kaa ek farsikrut rup, jo vibhinnata se hindi, hindustani or urdu kehalaata tha, dakshin asia ke dilli sultanate or mughal sultanate ke dauraan aakaar lene lagi
 The East India Company, in the Hindi-speaking northern provinces of modern India, replaced the official standard language, with English in Urdu script, in place of the Persian language, along with English
 unnisvin sadi ke aakhri kuch dashakon main uttar pashchimi praanton or avadh main hindi-urdu vivaad kaa prasphuton hua
 Supporters of Hindi and Urdu began to favor Hindustani written in Devanagari and Persian scripts respectively
 hindi ke andolan jo devanagari kaa vikaas or aadhikarik darje ko himaayat de rahe the uttari hind main sthapit hue
 Babu Shiv Prasad and Madan Mohan Malaviya were notable supporters of the beginning of this movement
 is ke nattejey main urdu andolanon kaa nirmaan hua, jinhone urdu ke aadhikarik darje ko samarthan diya; saiyad ahamed khan unke ek prasiddh samarthak the
 In 1900, the government granted equal symbolic status to both Hindi and Urdu which was opposed by the Muslims and the Hindus expressed happiness
 hindi or urdu kaa bhashaayin vivaad badhata gaya kyonki hindi main farsi-vyutpann shabdon ke tulya aupchaarik or shaikshik shabdaawalee kaa mul sanskrit ko liya gaya
 This led to increasing hindu-muslim differences, and Mahatma Gandhi suggested to use Urdu or Devanagari script within the traditional word Hindustani by re-purifying the standards
 iskaa congress ke sadasyon tathaa bharat ke swatantraaa andolan main shaamil kuch netaaon ne samarthan kiya
 As a result, in 1950, the institution formed for the Indian Constitution accepted Hindi as the official language in Devanagari script in place of Urdu along with English
 dono samudaayon main matbhed kaa mukhya kaaran apni-apni saanskrithik vichaaron kaa prasar karne sambandhi aakankshaayen ho sakati hai jo bharat kii swatantraaa ke dauraan khule vivaad ke rup main ubhari
 Muslims consider Muslim Ummah as their source of cultural inspiration whereas Hindus generally consider Vedic and mythological culture as their source of inspiration
 muslim shashan ke dauraan islam dharm sweekaar karne vaale logon ne us samskruti ko apana liya
 Persian language was considered the most important and prestigious language in Islamic regions like Central Asia at that time
 bharat main islam shashan ke sansthaapak vibhinn jaateeyata ke the jaise turk, mongol, arabi, irani, afgaan aadi tathaa un sabane farsi ko hi apni saamaanya bhashaa evam adalati bhashaa ke rup main kaam main liya
 Hindus saw it as a foreign culture
 samay ke saath sanskrit bhashaa, dhoti or ayurveda jaise vishyon ko hindu dharm se jodakar dekha jane laga or farsi bhashaa, unani chikitsa paddati ko muslimon se jodakar dekha jane laga
 This led to more differences in the cuisine and culture of the two communities
 attharahavin sadi or uske baad se bhartiya upmahadweep ke muslim shasit bhaagon main urdu ko adalati bhashaa ban gayi
 It developed with the influence of Arabic, Persian and Turkic languages, and Khadiboli spoken in Delhi and its surrounding areas
 jaise jaise muslim shashan uttari bharat main badha vaise vaise urdu anya sthanon kii mul bhashaaon ke saath judati gayi or vahaan ke mul shabdon ke sthaan par kuch farsi shabd sthapit ho gayi
 In course of time, it developed into a new language
 hindi bhi khadiboli se hi viksit hui, yadhyapi isamen adhiktar shabd gharelu boli or sanskrit se aaye
 Distance between Hindi and Urdu increased due to various factors
 muslim shaskaon ne urdu ko devanagari lipi ke sthaan par urdu lipi main likhnaa chunaa
 At the same time, mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries, Urdu language made its development in the form of written Urdu literature
 iske kaaran un hinduon main vibhaajan armbh ho gaya jo hindustani ko devanagari main likhte the or anya jo hindustani ko urdu lipi main likhane lag gayi the
 In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Hindi development movements added to the controversy
 pro paul aar brass ne apni pustak language, relijan and politics in north india, main likhaa he- In 1837, the British East India Company recognized the official language of the Persian language in different provinces as the official language and the court language
 haalanki bhartiya upmahadweep ke uttari kshetron main farsi bhashaa ko pratisthapit karne ke liye hindi ko devanagari main rakhane ke sthaan par urdu ko urdu lipi main rajbhasha or nyaay bhashaa ke rup main lagu kiya
 The most immediate cause of controversy is the anti-linguistic policy in North India in the 1860s
 yadhyapi tatkaaleen sarkaar ne vidyalayan shiksha main hindi or urdu donon ko hi madhyam ke rup main protsaahit kiya tha lekin us samay hindi athwa nagari lipi ko rajkaryon main hatotsahit kiya tha
 This led to conflict among students educated in Hindi and Urdu medium in government jobs, which later took communal form
 san 1867 main bharat main britani raaj ke dauraan agra or avadh ke sanyukt praant main kuch hinduon ne urdu ke sthaan par hindi ko rajbhasha banane kii maang kii
 Babu Shiv Prasad of Banaras was one of the earliest supporters of the Nagari script
 nyaayalay ke gyaapan patron ke anusaar 1868 main unhone bharat ke muslim shaskaon par unhen jabardasti farsi sikhaane kaa doshi bataaya
 In 1897, Madan Mohan Malaviya published a collection of statements and documents titled Court Character and Primary Education in North Western Provinces and Awadh in which he made a forced case for Hindi
 unnisvin sadi ke uttararddh tathaa beesvin sadi ke purvarddh main vibhinn hindi andolan huye jisamen 1893 main banaras main nagariprachaarini sabha, 1910 main elahabaad main hindi sahitya sammelan, 1918 main dakshin bharat prachaar sabha or 1926 main raashtra bhashaa prachaar samiti pramukh hai
 These movements were encouraged in 1881 when Urdu was recognized in Persian script in place of Hindi in Devanagari script as the official language in areas near Bihar
 unhone vibhinn nagaron main shiksha ayog ko 67,000 logon ke hastakshar vaale 118 smritipatr jamaa karawaaye
 The supporters of Hindi argued that the majority of the population here speaks Hindi, so the proposal of Nagari script will increase the chances of better education and appointment to government posts
 unka yah bhi tark tha ki urdu lipi dastavejon ko aspasht, jaal-saji kaa protsaahan tathaa jatil arabi evam farsi shabdon ke upyog ko protsaahit karegi
 Organizations like Anjuman taraqqi-e-urdu were formed to advocate Urdu
 urdu kii vakaalat karne waalon kaa tark tha ki hindi lipi ko teji se nahin likhaa ja saktaa or isamen maanakeekaran evam shabdaawalee kii kami kii bhi samasya he
 He also argued that the origin of Urdu language originated in India, which most people can speak fluently and included the argument that it was necessary to give it the status of official language in order to expand its field of education
 sampradayik hinsa bhadakne lag gayi or yah tejatarraar ho gaya
 Syed Ahmed Khan once said, "I look at Hindus and Muslims with one eye & see them like two eyes of a bride
 raashtra se meraa arth keval hindu or muslim he tathaa or kuch bhi nahin

 hamaari ruchi or samasyayen bhi samaan hai atah donon guton ko main ek hi raashtra ke rup main dekhtaa hoon
 "mr
 Shakespeare, Governor of Varanasi, enraged by the linguistic controversy, once said," i now believe that Hindus and Muslims can never live in one nation as if their religion and way of life are completely separate from each other
 " In the last three decades of the nineteenth century, controversy erupted several times in the North Western Provinces and Awadh
 bharat sarkaar ne shiksha kii pragati kii samiksha ke liye hunter ayog kii sthapana kii jise hindi or urdu kii vakaalat karne or unke apane-apane kaarnon ke liye kaam main liya
 Linguistic and cultural distances were increasing in both Hindi and Urdu
 bhashaayi aadhaar par hindi main sanskrit se tathaa urdu main farsi, arabi or turki se shabd rekhaankit kiye jate rahe
 Culturally Urdu began to be seen as belonging to Muslims and Hindi to Hindus
 1920 ke dashak main gandhiji ne is vistaar antar par dukh vyakt kiya or unhone donon bhashaaon ke punah vilay karke hindustani ko nagari or farsi donon lipiyon main likhane kaa aahvaan kiya
 Although he failed in his attempt to bring Hindi and Urdu under the Hindustani banner, it made it popular in non-hindi areas
 yah tark diya jaataa he ki hindi–urdu vivaad ne dakshin asia main muslim pruthakkaran ke beej boye
 Some argue that Syed Ahmed had expressed secessionist views long before this dispute
 april 1900 ko, uttar-pashchimi praant kii aupniveshik sarkaar ne nagari or farsi-arabi donon lipiyon ko samaan darja dene kaa aadesh jari kiya
 This order was strongly opposed by the Urdu supporters and supported by the Hindi supporters
 haalanki aadesh main usase bhi adhik pratikatmak yah tha ki isane nagari lipi ke upyog ke liye koi vishesh praavdhaan nahin rakhaa he
 persian-rabi retained its dominant position in the North Western Province and continued as the main writing language until independence in the state of Awadh
 madras prasidency ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri chakravarti rajagopalaachari ne hindustani ko madhyamik str kii shiksha main anivaary bhashaa ke rup main jodna prastaavit kiya yadhyapi baad main unhone 1965 main madras gaiyr-hindi andolan ke samay hindi ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya

 The literary genre that the Baran poets of Rajasthan used for their songs is called dingle or dingle
 vaise chaaran kaviyon ke atirikt prithiraj jaise anya kaviyon ne bhi dingal style main rachana kii he
 Bhatt poets of Rajasthan have been writing in "pingal" without taking shelter from "dingle"
 kuch vidvan "dingal" or "rajasthani" ko ek duusare kaa paryaayavachi maanate hai, kintu yah mat bhashashastreey drushti se trutipurna he
 In this way, it is unscientific to consider the works of Dalpati Vijay, Narpati Nalh, Bardai and Nallasingh Bhat in "dingle" literature
 inamen naalh kii rachana "katha" rajasthani kii he, kritrim dingal style main nibaddh nahin or shesh teen rachanaayen nishchit rup se pingal style main hai
 In fact, the first poet of "dingle" is the Dhadi poet Badar
 is kritrim saahitiyik style main paryaapt rachanaayen uplabdh hai jinamein adhikansh footkar dohe tathaa rajprashastiparak geet hai
 Prominent poets of "dingle" are Badar, Prithiraj, Isardas, Dursa Ji Adha, Karanidan Kavia, Mancharam Sevak, Bankidas Asiya, Kishan Ji Adha, Mixture poet Suryamall and Maharaja Chatursinghji
 antim kavi kii rachanaayen vastut: kritrim dingal style main na hokar kashm mewari boli main he
 The first use of the word "deangal" for literary language style is by Bankidas in Kukavi Batsi: 'dingaliyan miliyan karai, pingal tano prakas'
 is shabd kii vyutpatti evam arthvatta ke vishay main anek mat prachlit hai
 1
 The word "dingle" means irregular or lost degree
 sahityashastra env vyakaran ke niyamon kaa anusaran na karne ke kaaran yah style "dingal" kahi jaati he 
 2
 Earlier the language of Marudesh was called "dougal", later on the weight of "pingle" it came to be called "dingle"
 3
 'da' varnabahula hone ke kaaran ise "dingal" kaha jaataa he 
 4
 On the analogy of the sound of the dum degree, this language style of ojogunapratur heroic verses is called "dingle"
 5
 menaria in sabhi maton se asahmat hai
 According to him, the word "deangal", which is its actual form, is formed by the sum of the selfish suffix "l" with the word brag
 iskaa vaastavik arth ek ore ding se yukt or duusari ore angadh yaa avyavasthit he
 The sound and grammar of Dingle correspond to those of Marwari or Western Rajasthani, but its dictionary is replete with a number of Tadbhav, Ardhatsam and Indigenous words, which are not found to behave in the same way
 mishran kavi suryamall ke putr muraridaan ne ek dinglkosh kii rachana kii he jisamen dingal main prayukt shabdon ke arth die hai
 The recitation and singing of the lyrics are not very easy
 isamen vikatbandh geet or bhi kathin mana jaataa he
 Doctor Kavia gives the example of a grim song which had 54 volumes in the first line, then 4-4 lines of 14-14 volumes of the same character and complement! It had to be spoken in one voice and breath and poet lyricists practiced for it
 rajasthan main bhakthi, shaury or shringaar ras kii bhashaa rahi dingal ab chalan se baahar hoti ja rahi he
 Now the situation is that very few people who have the ability to read the ancient texts available in the English language are left
 kabhi dingal ke ospurn geet yuddh ke maidaanon main ranbankuron main utsaah bharaa karte the lekin vaqt ne aisa palata khaaya ki rajasthan, gujarat or pakistan ke sindh praant ke kuch bhaagon main sadiyon se bahati rahi dingal kii kavyadhara ab ojhal hoti ja rahi he
 Famous litterateur Dr Lakshmi Kumari Chudawat says in a tone of concern that if this situation continues, the existence of the finger will be at risk
 sahityakar punamchand bishnoi kehete hai ki pehle dingal ko sarkari sahaara miltaa tha or yah rojgaar se judi hui thi par ab aisa nahin he

 An important character of the Hindu mythology Mahabharata, Abhimanyu was the king of Puru Kul and the son of Arjuna among the Panch Pandavas
 katha main unka chal dwaara kaarunik ant bataaya gaya he
 Abhimanyu was the son of Mahabharata heroes Arjun and Subhadra, sister of Balarama and Krishna
 unhen chandra devtaa kaa putr bhi mana jaataa he
 It is believed that all the gods sent their sons to the earth in an incarnation form, but Chandradeva said that they cannot bear the separation of their son, so their son should be given only sixteen years of age in the human vagina
 abhimanyu kaa balykaal apni nanihaal dwarka main hi beetaa
 He was married to Uttara, the daughter of Maharaja Virat

 Abhimanyu was an extraordinary warrior
 unhone kaurav paksh kii vyuh rachana, jise chakravyuuh kaha jaataa tha, ke saat main se chah dwaar bhed die the
 According to the story, Abhimanyu knew the secret of Chakravyuh from the face of Arjuna while he was in his mother's womb
 par subhadra ke bich main hi nidramagn hone se ve vyuh se baahar aane kii vidhi nahin sun paye the
 The cause of Abhimanyu's death was Jayadratha, who prevented the other Pandavas from entering the array
 sambhawatah isi kaa laabh uthaa kar vyuh ke antim charan main kaurav paksh ke sabhi maharathi yuddh ke mandandon ko bhulaakar us balak par tut pade, jis kaaran usne veergati praapt kii
 To take revenge for Abhimanyu's death, Arjuna took the oath of slaying Jayadratha

 Any device which is used to injure, tame, or kill an enemy is called weapon or armament

 Weapons can be as simple as sticks, on the other hand as complicated as ballistic missiles
