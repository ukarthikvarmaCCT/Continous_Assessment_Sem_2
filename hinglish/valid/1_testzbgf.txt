 Gas manufacturing occurs for two purposes
 kuch gaisen prakaash utpann karne ke liye banaai jaati hai
 Such gases are called "lamp gases"
 kuch gaisen eendhan ke liye banaai jaati hai
 Such gases are called "heating gases"
 donon kism kii gaisen "dahm gas" hai
 They are also called "industrial gases"
 1792 i
 main england ke muradoc ne gas udyog kii neenv daali, tab unhone bataaya ki prakaash utpann karne ke liye gas kaa vyavhaar ho saktaa he
 In 1812, London, in 1815, Paris and in 1826 AD, the lighting of the effluent started to illuminate the streets of Burlin
 peeche gas badi maatra main banane lagi or chote-chote nagar bhi gas ke prakaash se jagamaga uthe
 Today, a lot of electric light is being replaced by lamp
 ek samay aisa samajha jaataa tha ki gas udyog kaa sheeghra hi ant ho jaayga, par isi bich 1885 i
 main tapadipt mantal ke pravesh se yah udyog phir chamak uthaa
 Backwards, the invention of carbureted watergas greatly increased the capacity to produce light and heat, which brought the industry back to life
 utpaadak gas kaa upyog udyog dhandhon main din din bad rahaa he
 Producing gas is nowadays used in heating kilns and furnaces, especially iron and steel and glass furnaces, incense and gas engines
 koyala gas ke saath, milakar jalgas eendhan main kaam aati he
 This produces a large amount of hydrogen and also synthesizes petroleum and methyl alcohol
 jalgas ke saath kuch hydrocarbon gas mili ho to aisi gas ko carbunikrut jalgas kehete hai
 Essential hydrocarbon gas is derived from the breakdown of petroleum oil
 iske janitr bhi jalgas ke janitr se hi hote hai
 Carbonized water gas flame is very bright
 hydrocarbon ke kaaran isamen gandh bhi hoti he
 The analysis of carbonized water gas is as follows: hydrogen 38
0 Carbon monoxide 35
0 methen or athen 10
0 Unsaturated Hydrocarbons 7
5 carbon daai-oxide 3
5 Nitrogen 6
0 gas kaa caloriman prati ghan foot 500 british ooshmaa maatrak hota he
 The oil distillation of mineral oils gives oil gas
 yah aswan bhabhakon main sampann hota he
 Like gas, this gas is purified and then stored in tanks, or by pressure in a cylinder
 is prakaar talgas taiyaar karne kii vidhi ko "pintash vidhi" kehete hai
 This gas is used for heating in small and large laboratories of India
 saadharantaya mitti kaa tel athwa disel tel iske liye upyukt hota he
 If oxygen or air is mixed with this gas, it becomes cheaper and the heating power also increases
 aisi gas main methen, ethilin, asitilin, benzene aadi hydrocarbon rahete hai
 In this way, this gas burns with a very burning flame, but in a specific type of flame, in which gas comes out from a very small hole, it burns without producing smoke
 aisi jwaala kii taapan shakti unchi hoti he
 If a little acetylene is added to this gas, the illuminating power of the gas increases further
 is gas ko jalaane ke liye tapadipt mantalavaala jwalak bhi bana he, jisase badi tej roshni praapt hoti he
 a mixture of air and some volatile hydrocarbons, usually petrol or petroleum ether, is also used for illumination
 petroleum ke bhanjan or aswan se kuch gaisen praapt hoti he, jinamein methen, athen, propen, narmal beauten, iso beauten or unke tadnurupi olyphine tathaa paintain rahete hai

 Sometimes this gas comes out with great pressure and sometimes it has to be removed from the pump
 sabhi khanij tailon ke kupon se yah gas nikalati he, par kuch aise kupon se bhi gas nikalati he jinamein khanij tel nahin hota
 When the gas first comes out then there is more methane in it, but gradually the amount of methane increases
 aisi gas main methen or athen ke sivaay propen, narmal beauten, isobuten, paintain or kuch adahya padaarth rahete hai
 The vapor pressures of methane and ethane are so high that they are not of commercial importance
 paintain kaa vaashp dabaav itnaa kam hota he ki gas ke rup main uskaa koi mulya nahin he, yadhyapi motor-eendhan main yah moolyavaan hota he
 Now only propane, normal butane and isobutane remain, which are of great importance in terms of trade
 prakritik gas yaa to shuddh propen ke rup main yaa 50 prati shat propen or 50 prati shat beauten ke mishran ke rup main, athwa shuddh narmal or isobuten ke rup main vyavahrut hoti he

 main sangruhit karaayaa tha or jise sikh matanuai 'gurugranth sahib ji' bhi kehete evam guruvat maanakar sammanit kiya karte hai
 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya
 Brother Bannon then copied the same and mixed the compositions of some other people which were not approved, but also the works of some others, Govind Singh prepared a third 'beed' in which, along with the works of the ninth Guru, himself
 One of his 'saloks' was also ranked
 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added
 'granth' kii pratham paanch rachanaayen kramash: 'japunisanu', 'sodaru' mahala1, 'sunibada' mahala1, 'so purakhu', mahala 4 tathaa sohila mahala ke naamon se prasiddh hai or inke ananthar 'sirirag' aadi 31 raagon main vibhakt pad aate hai jinamein pehle sikhaguruon kii rachanaayen unke anusaar sangruhit hai
 The positions of the Bhagats have been kept in their interiors, but somewhere in between, 'barhamasa', 'thinti', 'dinraini', 'ghodiyaan', 'siddha Gosthi', 'karhale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' etc
 Certain small and big specific compositions have also been added, which illustrate the poetic nature of ordinary folk songs
 un raganusaar krambaddh padon ke ananthar salok sahas kriti, 'gaatha' mahala 5, 'phunhe' mahala 5, chaubolen mahala 5, savaie simukh vaak mahala 5 or mudaavni mahala 5 ko sthaan mila he or sabhi ke ant main ek ragamala bhi de di gai he
 Even in the midst of these works, if 'salok' of Kabir and Sheikh Farid is stored, then elsewhere there are those eulogies created by 11 posts which are said to be in praise of Sikh Gurus and whose number is not even less
 'granth' main sangruhit rachanaayen bhashavavidhya ke kaaran kuch vibhinn lagati hui bhi, adhiktar saamanjasy evam ekarupata ke hi udhaaharan prastut karti hai
 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru
 at: guru ke samaan use svachh reshmi vastron main veshtit karke chandani ke neeche kisi unchi gaddi par 'padhraya' jaataa he, usapar chanwar dhalate hai, pushpadi chadhaate hai, uski aarti utaarte hai tathaa uske saamne naha dhokar jate or shraddhapurvak pranaam karte hai
 Sometimes his procession is also taken out and always try to walk accordingly
 granth kaa kabhi saptahik tathaa kabhi akhand paath karte hai or uski panktiyon kaa kuch uccharan us samay bhi kiya karte hai jab kabhi baalkon kaa namakaran kiya jaataa he, use diksha di jaati he tathaa vivahadi ke mangalotsav aate hai athwa shavsanskaar kiye jate hai
 Suitable times for specific small major compositions such as morning, evening, bedtime are certain and although the subjects of major collected works seem to be mainly related to philosophical principles, spiritual practice and praise, there is no doubt that 'etc
 The entire religious life of the Sikhs is influenced by the book

 The language of Sri Gurugranth Sahib is closer to the Hindi language than the modern Punjabi language and the meaning of guru-vyans is more perceptible to the Hindi-speaking than the Punjabi-speaking one
 duusari ore yadhyapi shri dasam granth kii bhi lipi gurmukhi he, parantu isaki bhashaa praayah apbhransh hindi main kavitaabaaddh he
 Its language is more difficult for Punjabi-speakers but well-known for Hindi-speakers

 During Philip's absence, the Thracian Maidi revolted against Macedonia
 sikandar ne turant unke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaakar unhen apane ilaake se khaded diya
 Later, he established a colony with the Greeks in the same area, also called Alexandropolis

 During the battle against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander saved his father's life
 thress main abhi bhi kabja jamaaye philip ne sikandar ko dakshini greece main ek abhiyaan ke liye ek sena khadaa karne kaa aadesh diya
 Elsewhere the Greek states do not interfere, Alexander shows that he is preparing to attack Illyria
 isi dauraan, illiarius ne macedonia par hamalaa bol diya, jise sikandar ne waapas khaded diya
 Philip and his army were reunited with their son in 338 BC, and they set out south to climb the Thermopile where they were captured after strong resistance from Thuburn's army
 ve ilesia shahar par kabja karne gaye, jo athens or thibs se kuch hi dur sthit tha
 Seeing that Demosthenes-led Athinian decided to form an alliance with Thebes against Macedonia
 halanki philip ne bhi athens ke khilaaf thibs se gathbandhan hetu doot bheje, lekin thibs ne athens kaa saath diya
 Philip marched towards Amphisa where he defeated the mercenaries sent by Demosthenes and forced the city to surrender
 philip phir ilesia laut gaya, jahaan se usne athens or thibs ko shanti kaa antim prastaav bheja, jise donon ne khaarij kar diya

 philip ne jaanboojhkar apane sainikon ko peeche hatane kaa aadesh diya, taaki athenian sainik uskaa peechha kar apni suraksha pankti se alag ho sake, or ve usamen bhed laga sake
 Alexander was the first to break the security lines of Theban, with Philip's generals behind him, after damaging the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to advance and to surround them quickly
 athenian ke haarane ke saath hi, thibian akele ladane ke liye bache hue the or chaaron ore se ghire hue the

 In Corinth, Philip founded the "hellenic Alliance", which included most of the Greek city-states except Sparta
 philip ko is lig ke naam par hegon naam diya gaya, or usne farsi samrajya par hamalaa karne kii apni yojana kii ghoshnaa kii
 When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Iridis, the niece of his commander Atalus
 is vivaah se sikandar kii uttaradhikari ke rup main daavedaari sakant main aa gai, kyonki cleopetra iridis se utpann betaa puri tarah se macedonion uttaradhikari hota, jabaki sikandar keval aadha macedonion tha
 During the wedding feast, the drunken Atlas publicly prayed to the gods that a legitimate heir would now be born in the Macedonia
 sikandar apni maa ke saath mecedon se bhaag kar, use apane mamaa, epirus ke raja alexander pratham ke paas dodona main chhod diya
 And himself went to Illyria, where he sought protection from the Illyrian king
 kuch saal purv sikandar se ladaai main parajeet hone ke baavjood usne sikandar kaa atithi ke taur par swaagat kiya
 However, it appears that Philip never wanted to reject his politician and military-trained son
 tadanusaar, sikandar ek pariwarik dost, dameratus ke prayaason ke kaaran chah maheene ke baad macedoniyaan waapas laut aata hai
 In the following year, Pixodaras, the Persian governor of Caria proposed marriage to his eldest daughter, Alexander's half-brother, Philippe Erhidius
 olympius or sikandar ke kai doston ne suzav diya ki philip ne arhidiyas ko apana uttaradhikari banane kaa iraadaa kiya he
 Alexander sent an angel to Thessalyus to tell Thessalus that he should give his daughter's hand to Alexander instead of giving it to the illegitimate son
 jab philip ne is bare main suna to usne prastaav vaarta ko roak diya or sikandar ko chillaate hue kaha ki vah cu pixodaras kii beti se shaadi karnaa chahta he, usne samajhaayaa ki vah uske liye behatar dulhan chahta tha
 Philip deported four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Narcus, Ptolemy, and Arizius, and sent the Corinthians to bring Thessalus into chains
 336 isa purv kii garmiyon main, eige main apni beti cleopetra ke vivaah main bhaag lete hue philip ko uske angrakshakon ke captain, posnis dwaara hatya kar di gai
 When Posnis attempted to escape, Alexander's two companions, Perdicus and Leonatus, followed and killed him
 usee samay, 20 varsh kii umr main sikandar ko raison or sena dwaara raja ghoshit kar diya gaya
 As soon as he took the throne, Alexander started destroying his rivals
 jisaki shuruyaat usne apane chachere bhai, purv amintas chauthe kii hatya karavaake kii
 He also killed two Macedonian princes of the Lancastes region, though leaving a third, Alexander Lancastes
 olympius ne cleopetra iridiis or europa ko, joki philip kii beti thi, jinda jala diya
 When Alexander came to know about this, he was outraged
 sikandar ne atlus kii hatya kaa bhi aadesh diya, joki cleopetra ke chachaa or asia abhiyaan kii sena kaa agrim senapati tha
 Atalus had gone to Athens at that time to talk to Demothanes about the possibility of his loss
 atlus ne sikandar kaa kai baar ghor apmaan kar chukaa tha, or cleopetra kii hatya ke baad, sikandar use jivit chhodane ke liye bahut khatarnaak maanata tha
 Alexander left Erhidius, who was mentally handicapped, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias
 philip kii mrityu kii khabar se kai rajyon main vidroh hone laga, jinamein thibs, athens, thisli or macedon ke uttar main thresian janajati shaamil the
 When news of the rebellion reached Alexander, he immediately noticed it

 He found that Thistley's army, occupying the path between Mount Olympus and Mount Osa, ordered his army to climb Mount Osa
 duusare din jab thislian sena jaagi, to paaya ki sikandar apni sena ke saath unke peeche khadaa tha, or unhone turant aatmasamarpan kar diya
 Alexander joined his cavalry and started marching south towards the Peloponnese
 sikandar thermopyle main rukaa, jahaan use amfictionik lig ke netaa ke rup main chunaa gaya, phir vah waha se dakshin kii ore corinth ki ore nikal gaya
 Athens pleaded for peace, which Alexander accepted and pardoned the rebels
 sikandar or diojanij diogens da sinik ke bich prasiddh mulaakaat corinth main rahane ke dauraan hui thi
 When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for them, the philosopher disgustingly asked Alexander to stand aside, as he was blocking the sunlight
 is hajir jawaab se alexander ko khush hua, or usne kaha kii "agar main sikandar nahin hota, to main diogens bananaa chahta"
 In Corinth, Alexander was given the title of hegemon as Philip was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia
 yahan use thresian vidroh kii khabar bhi praapt hui
 Before crossing Asia, Alexander wanted to secure his northern borders
 335 isa purv ke vasant main, vah kai vidrohon dabaane ke liye chal padaa
 Starting from Ampolis, he traveled eastward into the country of "independent Thracians"; And on Mount Hemus, the Macedonian army also defeated and defeated the Thracian armies at the heights
 aage sena tribali desh main ghus gaye or unhone unki sena ko laijinas nadi ke paas haraaya
 Alexander made a three-day journey to the Danube, and encountered the Gatte tribe on the opposite bank on the way
 raat ko hi nadi paar karte hue, usne unhen aashcharyachakit kar diya or pehali ghudsavaar jhadap ke baad unki sena ko peeche hatane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 It was up to Alexander when the news reached that the king of Celsius, Illyria, and Gluaki, the king of Tualanti, were rebelling against him in the open
 vah pashchim main ilariria ki ore rukh kiya, sikandar ne ek ke baad ek dono ko haraane ke baad, dono shaskaon ko apni saina ke saath bhaagane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 With these victories, he had secured his northern border
 jab sikandar apane uttar ke abhiyaan main tha, use thibs or athenian ke ek baar phir se vidroh ki jaankaree mili or sikandar turant dakshin kii ore chal padaa
 While others were hesitating to collide with Alexander, Thebes decided to fight
 thibs kaa pratirodh aprabhavi tha, or sikandar ne unhain pachhad shahar ko kabje main le liya or or is kshetra ko anya bootian shaharon ke bich main baant diya
 The end of Thebes silenced Athens and temporarily brought peace to all of Greece
 tab sikandar antipeter ko raaj-pratinidhi ke rup main chhod, apane asian abhiyaan nikal gaya
 After Spitomenes' death and his new marriage to Roxena, Alexander moved his attention to the Indian subcontinent
 usne gandhar ke sabhi pramukhon ko aamantrit kar, unhen apane adhikaar kshetra sikandar ke adheen karne ke liye kaha
 Ambhi, the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus River to the Jhelum River, accepted it, but the chieftains of some hilly regions, including the Ashwanyas and Ashwakyanas of the Kamboj region, refused to oblige
 aambhi ne sikandar ko dosti kaa yakeen dilaane or unhen moolyawaan uphaaron dene, uske sabhi sena ke saad khud uske paas gaya
 Alexander not only returned him his rank and gifts, but he gifted Ambi "persian clothes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 gold talents"
 sikandar ne apni sena baant di, or ambi ne sindhu nadi par pul ke nirmaan karne main hipastian or pedricus kii madad kii, saath hi uske sainikon ko bhojan kii aapurti karata rahaa

 sikandar ke aage badhane par, takshashila ne uski 5,000 logon kii ek sena kii madad ke saath, jhelum nadi kii ladaai main hissaa bhi liya
 After victory in this war, Alexander sent Ambi to negotiate with the Purvas, offering conditions like subduing the whole kingdom of Porus to Sikandar, since Ambi and Porus were old enemies, he rejected all the terms and Ambi with great difficulty
 Saved his life and escaped from there
 haalanki iske baad, donon pratidwandviyon ko sikandar ne vyaktigat madhyasthata se mail milaap kara diya; or takshashila ko, jhelum par bede ke liye upkaran or sanybal ke yogadan ke kaaran, aambhi ko jhelum nadi or sindhu ke bich kaa puraa kshetra saunpa diya gaya; machaatas ke bete philip kii mrityu ke baad use or shakti mil gai; sikandar kii maut ke baad or 321 isa purv triparadisus main praanton ke vibhaajan baad ke bhi use apane adhikaar ko barkaraar rakhane kii anumati di gai
 In the winters of 327 / 326 BC, Alexander led an expedition against regional tribes such as the Espacioi of the Kunar valleys, the Guaranis of the Gurus valley, and the Asenaki of the Swat and Buner valleys
 aspisioi ke saath ek bhayankar ladaai shuru hui jisamen sikandar kaa kandhaa ek bhaalaa se ghayal ho gaya, lekin aakhirkaar aspisioi haar gaya
 Alexander then faced Assakenoi, who fought the strongholds of Massaga, Ora, and Aaron

 According to Curtius, "not only did Alexander kill the entire population of Massaga, but turned all his buildings into rubble

 After Massaga and Ora, many Ascensians fled to the fortress of Arones

 The reggae usually performs the vocals on the second and fourth rhythms of each bar, with the guitar also emphasizing either the third rhythm or holding the tone of the second rhythm until the fourth rhythm is played

 The drumbeats of reggae fall into three main categories: One Drop, Rockers and Steppers
 In One Drop, there is full emphasis on the third beat of the bar
 beet van puri tarah se khaali hota he, jo ki lokapriy sangeet main asaadhaaran he
 There is some controversy as to whether the reggae should be counted as its beats hit three, or whether it falls between two and four, so should it be counted in half fast
 Leroy "horsmouth" Wallace described the beat as "a combination of two-four"
 anek log is style ke srashta ke rup main da welers ke carlton barat ko shrey dete hai
 An example of this can be heard in Barrett's singing of Bob Marley and Weller's song "one Drop"
 barat aksar hai-hat par trik cross-ridam kaa prayog kiya karte the, jinhen kaaya album kii "running awe" jaisi bob marle or welers kii anek recordings main suna ja saktaa he
 The emphasis on beat three is all in the reggae drumbeat, but the rockers beat also emphasizes beat one
 slai or robi ne is beet kii shuruyaat kii, jinhone baad main nrityshala ko bahut zyada prabhavit karne vaali dhwani "rab-e-dab" ke srijan main madad kii
 The perfect example of this style is found in Sly Dunbar's drumming of Mighty Diamonds' "right Time"
 rockers beet hameshaa sidhaa-saral nahin hota he or praayah isamen vibhinn shabd sankochan shaamil kiye jate hai
 Black Uhuru's song "spongy reggae" is an example of this
 steppers main, baar par baas drum se chaar thos beats bajaaye jate hai, isse beet ko ek agrahi gati praapt hoti he
 The "exodus" of Bob Marley and The Vailors is an example of this
 steppers beet kaa ek anya aam naam he "four on da floor"
 burning spear kaa 1975 kaa geet "red, gold and green" iske shuruaati udaahranon main ek he
 Steppers Beat was adopted by the Ska revival band 2 Tone in the late 1970s and early 1980s
