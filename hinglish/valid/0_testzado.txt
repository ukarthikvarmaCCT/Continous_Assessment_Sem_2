 isko kai tarah se napa jaataa he- The General Packet Radio Service is a packet-oriented mobile data service, available to users in the 2G Cellular Communication System's Global System of Mobile Communications, as well as 3G systems
 2G pranali main, GPRS, 56-114 kbit / s kaa data dar pradaan karata he
 For GPRS data transfers, it is usually charged per megabyte of transferred traffic, while data communication via traditional circuit switching is payable per minute of combination time, regardless of whether the user is actually Is using capacity or is in a passive state
 GPRS ek sarvshereshth prayaas packet switchd seva he, circuit swimming ke vipareet, jisamen gaiyr mobile upyogkartaaon ke liye conection ke dauraan ek nishchit seva kii gunvattta, kii guarantee di jaati he
 The 2G cellular system, combined with GPRS, is often described as 2
5G, ie, a technology between the second and third generation of mobile telephony
 It provides medium-speed data transfer using unused time division multiple access channels, for example GSM systems
 Originally, there was also the idea of extending other standards while extending GPRS, but instead those networks are being changed to use the GSM standard, so that GSM is the only network where GPRS is used
 
 GPRS ko GSM release 97 or nae release main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 Originally it was standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, but now by the Third Generation Partnership Project
 GPRS ko, purv ke CDPD or i-mod packet switchd praudyogiki kii ek GSM pratikriya ke rup main viksit kiya gaya
 GPRS extends GSM circuit switched data capabilities and makes the following services possible: yadi GPRS par SMS istemaal kiya jaataa he, to 30 SMS prati minute kii ek SMS sancharan gati praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is faster than using ordinary SMS on GSM, which has a transmission speed of 6 to 10 SMS per minute
 GPRS nimnlikhit protocol kaa samarthan karata he: When TCP / IP is used, one or more than one IP address can be allocated to each phone

 The maximum speed of a GPRS connection introduced in 2003 was the same as a modem connection in an analog wire telephone network, 32–40 kbit / S, depending on the phone used
 Latency is too long; The round trip time is typically 600–700 ms
 And often reaches 1 sec
 GPRS ko vishisht rup se vaak se kam praathamikta di jaati he or is tarah conection kii gunvattta main bahut bhinnata hoti he
 Devices with latency / RTT correction are generally available
 iske alaava, kuch operataron ke paas suvidhaon kaa network unnayan bhi uplabdh he

 Sociologists point out two fundamental means of social control: nauijiniyari praudyogiki kii vah shakha he jisamen samudri jahaajon evam anya mashiinon ke dizin evam nirmaan main vishishti pradaan kii jaati he
 Apart from this, those people appointed on a vessel are also called naviginers who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of that ship
 iske alaava nauijiniyaron ko jahaaj kaa sivej, prakaash vyavastha, vaataanukoolan evam jalapradaay vyavastha bhi dekhni padati he
 The art of navigational, construction and operation of boats is very old
 isaki charchaa pracheenatam sahitya main pai jaati he
 Although a large part of India's ancient texts have disappeared, the study of all the ancient texts of Vedas, Puranadi available at this time proves that even in the Vedic period, Indian people built ships like ships and trade in distant countries across the sea
 Used to go for yuktikalpataru naamak ek pracheen granth main to naukaaon tathaa jahaajon ke das das bhed bhi bataae gaye hai
 Classifying the wood in a book written in the time of Bhojraj, it is said that wood will be more suitable for the construction of naukaranam
 
 In the Adi festival of Mahabharata, for a boat set up by Vidur, saying "sarvatsahan Nahan Yantyuktam Patakinim" has also indicated its operation
 europea itihaas se bhi pataa chalata he ki 18veen shatee ke antim bhaag tak jahaaj lakadiyon ko dhaatu kii keelon or pattiyon se jodakar hi banaae jate the or samudr main paalon kii sahaayta se hawa kii shakti dwaara sanchalit kiye jate the
 When James Watt built his dialectical pump engine in 1784, the attention of the people there shifted to using the power of steam in ships and their structures were also made entirely of steel
 vastut: naukaaon par injanon ke prayog ke prayaas to 18veen shatee se hi hone lage the
 The brief evolution of steam-powered boats is as follows: uparyukt vivaran main ham dekhte hai ki 18veen shatabdi main injanon dwaara naukaaon ko chalaane ke jitne bhi prayog hue, lagbhag asafal rahe kyonki ingine kii banaavat ekadish kriyaatmak hone ke kaaran uski chaal main sthirataa nahin aane paati thi
 The dialectical engine of the watt also had many defects which caused great inconvenience in navigation
 aarambhik kaal main steffenson ke valve gatiyantra kaa bhi upyog hua, lekin jab jways ke valve gatiyantra kaa avishkaar hua to nausanchaalan keliye iskaa upyog bada suvidhajanak siddh hua
 Due to lack of space on boats, the above types of cross engines were very inconvenient, so people also invented many types of standing engines
 1850 i
 tak england main jitne bhi jahaaj yaa naukaaye baniin unke pedalchakron ko chalaane ke liye bagali liver yukt injanon kii hi pradhanta thi, jo jahaji kaamon ke liye saadhaaran beam ingine ke hi parishkrut rup the
 Subsequently, a special type of beam engine called Grasshopper was invented, which occupies less space than its predecessor crossover engines
 ab to jahaji boyler bhi itane unnat ho gaye hai ki jalanalika byleron se 575 pound prati varg inch daab kaa vaashp, jiskaa taap lagbhag 399rou sein
 hota he, 2,00,000 pound prati ghanta tak praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Modern ship steam engines are also being made so powerful that they can get 1,000 to 3,000 horsepower from each cylinder of the quadrangle
 winterther kii sulzar bros naamak form jahaji upyogon ke liye is prakaar ke dijal ingine banaati he jinaki prayek ikai main 1,000 ashv shakti utpann karanevaale 10 silinder tak hote hai
 They work with a double stroke method
 ingine chaalit jahaajon ke aarambhik kaal main sabhi naukaaye pedal chakron dwaara hi chalaai jaati thim, lekin pranoditr kaa avishkaar ho jane ke baad se samudri jahaajon main pedalchakron kaa prayog band ho gaya, phir bhi nadiyon main chalanevaali naukaaon main ab bhi inkaa prayog hota he
 There are two types of paddle cycle according to the texture of wooden plots: areey plav to chakra kii paridhi ke upar traigy disha main pakke kase hote hai
 The feathery plavas rotate slightly on their mortise and also become diagonally as required
 areey plarvon main yah dosha he ki pani se upar uthte samay ve kuch pani apane saath bhi le jate hai, jise uthaane main ingine kii shakti kaa thodaa apvyay hota he
 The second drawback is that they are able to remain in a nearly vertical position in only a small part of the cycle of the paddle cycle
 isamen hi ve pani par acchhee takat laga sakate hai
 With the help of its triangular connective punches, which are related to the chest of the chakra, the winged plavas rotate on their mortise as needed and change their angle as long as they remain under water
 baahar nikalne par ve apane saath adhik pani bhi nahin uthaate
 The axles driving the paddle cycles are fitted in the middle of the boat and two engines are mounted in the middle of the boat in such a way that if the two engines run both paddle cycles together and if unconnected then only their own paddle cycle
 Change the direction of the yacht or change the wobble as required, driving one forward and the other backwards
 aisa kar sakane ke liye donon injanon ke dhuron bich main jahaan milte hai, vahaan ek dhure ke sire ko panalidaar banaakar usapar sarakati hui, chaalak charkhi laga dete hai
 When the two have to run together, the wheel is stuck in a crank pin made on the second axle
 pedal chakron kii choti naukaaon ko chalaane ke liye khadey ingine to apane jhonke ke kaaran anupyukt hote hi he or aade ingine bahut jagah gherte hai; at: inke liye 19veen shatabdi main kai vishesh prakaar ke ingine banaae gaye the, jo unche bhi nahin thi or adhik jagah bhi nahin gherte the
 These engines are the staple engine, diagonal engine, oscillating engine, Penn's trunk engine and Maudsley's return connecting rod engine
 aadhunik jahaajon ko chalaane ke liye unke pichley sire par jo pankhenuma yantra lagaaya jaataa he use nodak yaa pranoditr athwa 'pranodi pench' kehete hai
 Its shape appears to be feathery, but the action is exactly the same as the churidar screw
 yah pankhenuma pench samudr ke pani main chuudi si katata hua jahaaj ko lekar aage bad jaataa he
 Above the screw we can see the entire entourage of bangles, but not in these feathers, because each petal is a radius of a thin angoid of a screw designed with a very large pitch
 saadhaaran pench main jaise-jaise chuudi kii galiyon kii sankhya badhati hai uski lead kii lambaai bhi usee anupaat se bad jaati he
 The curve of the propellant's petals also fit into a very large lead
 at: yadi koi pankhaa choti lead kaa he to use lambey faasale ko tay karne ke liye adhik chakkar lagane padenge or yadi vah bade lead kaa he to vah kam chakkaron main hi us faasale ko tay kar saktaa he
 Just as a solid screw and lead make a definite distance by rotating, this porous screw running in water cannot do the same, because the water is a fluid, it moves here and there
 is prakaar jahaaj kii chaal main jo kami aa jaati he use pranoditr kaa sarpan yaa sarak kehete hai
 The first time the propellant was invented, at that time, the engineers encountered a problem of running it at a fast speed
 pandlechakron ko chalaanevaale ingine bahut hi dhime kii sahaayta leni padi
 Later this problem was solved with the rapid locomotives being built and then the use of turbines and diesel engines started
 pranoditr ke thik prakaar se kaam karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki uske pankhe pani main puri tarah se duube rahen
 Therefore, the axles running it should also come out of the frame and casing through any suitable hole on the back side of the ship
 yah jal-tal-rekha se kaaphi neeche hota he
 There is also a arrangement between the circumference of those holes and the circumference of the axles so that the sea water should not enter the vessel from it
 is kaam ke liye anek prakaar kii yuktiyon banaai gai hai
 In simple tips, the axle is also heated, so the process of filling it with oil and reducing heat with hot water on special occasions has also been arranged
 jin jahaajon main do yaa teen pranoditr lagaae jate hai unamem bagali pranoditron ke dhuron kii kholon ko sahaara dene ke liye jahaaj ke baaju ke frem main uchit prakaar se bracket lagaakar, unamem kholon ko sthirataa se baandhakar pranoditr kaa dhura chalaaya jaataa he
 As the propellant rotates when the water rips the ship forward, the Node of the same magnitude turns forward as its reaction, causing the fear of the bearings to wear out too quickly and the parts to be replaced 
 at: pranodi dhure kii pichhali khol, jisamen se vah dhura peeche kii taraf baahar niklaa rahata he or ingine athwa tarabine ke bich ek boxnuma nodak bering laga diya jaataa he, jiske bheetar kii taraf khaanchon main dhure par bani kai kolrein sahi sahi baithi rahati hai or ve sab milakar pranodi pankhe se aanevaale nod ko sah leti hai
 On the sides of the bearings, crescent-shaped crescent linings are placed on either side of the axle rings and oil-filling is arranged over them
 kai nodak bering boxon main tel kii naand neeche kii taraf bani hoti he, jisamen dhure kii choleren khandash: dubi hui chalaa karti hai
 The lining pits in these are of horseshoe shape
 vaashp tarabinon ke avishkaar ke pahile tak, pranoditron ko chalaane ke liye upar kii taraf silinderonvaale khadey vaashp ingine kaam main laae jate the, jo aksar chatushsanyoji prakaar ke hua karte the
 Two prop engines are mounted in pairs to drive each propellant in the ships
 jab jahaaj kaa paribhraman ho yaa disha badalani ho tab un do main se keval ek kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The two engines together run a propellant while driving the ship rapidly forward
 pranoditron ko chalaane ke liye aajkal tarabinon kaa rivaaj badhata ja rahaa he, kyonki ye kai baton main injanon se bhi adhik suvidhajanak tathaa saste padate hai
 By the way, the cost of vapor is more per horsepower than engines
 chitra 16, main ek pranoditr yukt chote jahaaj main ek ucch daab or ek alp daab ke tarabinon kaa joda unke sanghnitr sahit dikhaaya he
 The turbine is a very fast rotating device, where it has to run much slower than the turbine in order to use the propellant efficiently
 at: pranoditr kii chaal mand karne ke liye bich main choti or badi garaari lagaana aavashyak ho jaataa he
 a small pinion is placed on the axis of the turbine and a large pinion on the axle of the propellant
 kisi jahaaj main kahan kahan tarabine baithaae jaaain yah, baat us jahaaj ke aakaar evam prakaar par nirbhar karti he
 The simplest way is that a propellant must have at least one turbine
 doosraa tarika yah he ki ucchdaab or alpadaab ke tarabine kaa joda sanghnitr sahit prayek pranoditr ke saath lagaae jaae
 In this arrangement, the fresh vapor coming from the boiler will first be immersed in the condenser after working in high pressure turbine and then in low pressure turbine
 is prabandh main utpaadit shakti kaa is prakaar se samavibhaajan kiya jaataa he ki prayek tarabine kaa joda ek ek pranoditr ko gear ke madhyam se donon taraf swatantraapurvak chalaa sake
 In many ships, which have three propellants, the high pressure turbine drives the middle propellant and the low pressure turbine in both arms drives side propellants
 tarabinon ke prayog ke aarambhik kaal main or aajkal bhi, kai bade bade jahaajon main sanyoji injanon ke saath saath tarabinon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 When the ship moves at full speed, both the turbine and the engine work together, but when the ship has to move upside down, the connection of the turbine is cut off from the axle
 aisa karte samay alpadaab ke silinder main kaam karne ke baad vaashp, tarabine main jaakar kaam karne ke badale sidhe sanghnitr main chalaa jaataa he
 In this, the ship's intermediate propellant is then driven by a triaxial connective engine of high pressure, mid pressure and low pressure, and after working in the cylinders of the low pressure, the vapor drives the turbines in the arms, at a pressure of about nine pounds per square inch, which allows the arms to Propellants move
 phir baad main yah vaashp sanghnitr main jaakar visarjeet ho jaataa he
 The combined configuration of engines and turbines can be useful in large ships with speeds below 16 knots per hour
 isse unchi raftaaravaale jahaajon ke liye to purnataya tarabinon kaa prayog hi laabhadaayak rahata he
 Until the first phase of the 20th century, fire-engine boilers were mostly used to vaporize ship engines, of which Scotch was considered the best, and the wilcox-babcock boiler was considered the best of the water boilers
 ab jalanalika byleron kaa prachaar badhata ja rahaa he, kyonki inke dwaara ucch daab kaa vaashp vipul maatra main bahut hi thode samay main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Now wilcox-bawcock has also improved a lot
 inke atirikt staling boyler, thornicrapt boyler, yaaro boyler, hwitefoster boyler aadi, jalanalika byleron kaa jahaji kaamon main bahut prayog hua karata he
 Sea water is saline, so it cannot be used directly in boilers and it is not even drinkable
 jahaajon par is pani ko kaam ke yogya banane ke liye aswan yantra, udvashpak aadi upsaadhitra lagaae jate hai
 Special types of feeders are used to supply water inside the boiler and fill heaters are installed to heat it well before entering the boiler
 injanon or tarabinon main prayog karne ke baad vaashp ko vrutha na jane dekar, use sanghanitron main jamaakar tathaa thandhakar pani ke rup main phir se prayog ke laayak bana liya jaataa he
 The distillate and the evaporator only meet the shortage in the condenser water
 khaadya padaarthon ko puri yatra bhar surakshit rakhane ke liye prashithitr lagaae jate hai
 Aerators are used as ventilators, ventilators for lighting, aural gears and fluidized pumps for cranes, etc
 to drive ventilation and small appliances
 bandargahon par pahunchne par muy vaashp ingine band kar die jate hai
 There are small diesel and oil engines installed for driving the ship back and forth and for lighting and repair works
 ghat naukaaon or nadiyon main chalanevaali naukaaon ke sanchaalan ke liye aajkal tel or petrol injanon kaa adhiktar prayog hota he
 Small sea-going vessels are powered by diesel engines operating according to auto cycles
 bahut bade jahaaj to ab bhi vaashp ingine or tarabinon se bhi chalate hai, kyonki deazal jahaajon par lagbhag 5-6 deazal ingine milakar ek pranodak dhure ko chalaa pate hai
 Diesel engines have a single cylinder, which generally does not exceed 1,000 horsepower
 aadhunik prakaar ke achche se achche, vishesh prakaar ke, deazal ingine se bhi prati silinder do yaa dhai hajaar se adhik ashwashakti nahin praapt kii ja sakati
 If five diesel engines are also put together for a propellant, then they will get 1000 horsepower, whereas a modern type of large ship requires 70-80 thousand horsepower continuously
 isliye bahut bade jahaajon kaa chalaane ke liye ab bhi vaashp injanon kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Yes, diesel engines can be taken for minor tasks on them
 beshak, chote jahaajon ke liye deazal ingine sarvatha upyukt hote hai, kyonki inkaa prayog karne se boyler, koyala, udvashpak, bharanjaltapak, bharan filter, bharanpanch or sanghanitron kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati or unase bachaa hua sthaan vyapaarik maal ladane ke kaam main aa saktaa he
 In a small space, oil can be stored for the entire journey, good cleaning can be done around diesel engines, because there is no work of ash, coal and smoke
 fireman jaise kushal karmchaariyon kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin rahati or ek hi chaalak kai injanon ko sanbhaal saktaa he, at: vetan main bhi bachat ho jaati he
 Ships and boats are operated by rudder, which is mounted on the basis of sternpost
 ise chalaane ke liye choti naukaaon main to radar ke danthal ke upree sire par haathcharkhi laga di jaati he, lekin bade jahaajon main use chalaane ke liye chote injanon yaa jalashaktichaalit yantron kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 The force required to rotate the rudder depends on the size of the rudder, the speed of the ship, and the angle of the rudder from the ship's longitudinal midline
 udhaahrant:, yadi koi jahaaj 15 note prati ghante kii raftaar se chal rahaa ho uske radar ke pani main duube hue bhaag kaa kshetrafal 100 varg foot ho tathaa madhyarekha se uskaa kone 30 degree ho to ganit dwaara yah siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki us radar ko ghumaane main 32,130 pound kaa bal lagaana padegaa, jo maanviya samarthy ke baahar kii baat he
 For this work, Brown's hydraulic steering telemotor, Harrison's steering gear, Hastie's steering gear and halle-shaw Martinue's hydraulic steering gear are the main ones
 chote vaashp injanon ke jor se kuch dantachakr chalakar radar dand ke upar lage ek bade dantachakr ko aavashyaktaanusaar ghuma dete hai
 Special types of segmental and clutch brakes are also installed to stop the cycle at the desired place
 plastic ricycling raddi yaa bekaar plastic utpaadon ko punah praapt karne tathaa is saamagree ko phir se aise upyogi utpaadon main badalane kii prakriya he, jo kai baar apni mul avasthaa se bilkul alag hote hai
 For example, plastic bottles of soft drinks can be melted and molded into plastic chairs or tables
 aamtaur par ek plastic kaa punarnavinikaran samaan prakaar ke plastic main nahin kiya jaataa or punarnavinikaran prakriya se praapt plastic se bane utpaada phir se ricycling ke yogya nahin hote
 Compared to other materials such as glass or metal, the recycling of plastic polymers requires excessive processing
 plastic main ghulanshiltaa bahut kam hoti he jiskaa kaaran inaki badi polimar shrinkhalaaon kaa ucch aanvik bhaar he
 a large molecule has contact with its surrounding environment along its entire length, so its mixture has higher enthalpy than an organic molecule of the same composition
 itane bade anu ko pighalaane ke liye keval ooshmaa hi paryaapt nahin he, is vajah se, sahi dhang se mishrit hone ke liye aksar plastic kii sanrachana kaa samaan hona aavashyak he
 When plastics of different varieties are melted together they are separated in a phased manner and folded like oil and water
 charan simaaon ke parinamswaroop praapt hone vaale padaarth main sanrachanaatmak kamajori pai jaati he, jiskaa arth he ki polimar mishran keval simit anuprayogon main hi upyogi hai
 Another barrier to recycling is the increased use of dyes, fillers and other chemicals in plastics
 polimar ke chipchipe hone ke kaaran aamtaur par kam kharch main philler hataanaa mushkil he or ve un kai prakriyaaon se kshatigrast ho jaayenge jo aasaani se atirikt rang hataa sakati hai
 They are often used more for recycling due to less use of chemicals in soft drink cartons and plastic bags
 jaivik rup se apaghatit hone vaale plastic ke upyog main vruddhi ho rahi he
 If some of these products are mixed with other plastic products for recycling, the plastic obtained from it cannot be recycled due to differences in properties and melting point
 ricycling se pehle, plastic utpaadon ko unke rezin pahchaan code ke anusaar alag kiya jaataa he, yah polimar kii kismon ko shreneebaddh karne kii vidhi he, jise 1988 main plastic udyog sanstha dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 For example, the polyethylene terephthalate, commonly called PET, has a resin code 1
 inhen aksar rangon ke anusaar bhi alag kiya jaataa he
 After that the plastic recyclables are cut into small pieces
 iske baad kagaz ke label jaisi ashuddhiyon ko samaapt karne ke liye ye kate hue tukade kai prakriyaaon se guzarate hai
 This material is melted and often taken out in the form of muffins after which they are used in the manufacture of other substances
 kai chunautiyon ko adhik vistrut monomer ricycling prakriya ke prayog dwaara hal kiya ja saktaa he, jisame sankshepan polimar anivaary rup se iskaa nirmaan karne vaali polimrizeshan prakriya ke vyutkram se guzarate hai
 This gives a mixture of chemicals that made up the original polymer, which can be purified and can be used to add similar polymer chains
 methnolysis prakriya ke madhyam se piiti kii ricycling ke liye is kism kaa ek pramukh sanyantr du pont dwaara kep fier, uttari carolina, america main kholaa gaya tha, kintu aarthik dabaavon ke kaaran isane yah sanyantr band kar diya
 Another process in which the conversion of various polymers into petroleum is done by a less precise thermal depolarization process
 is tarah kii prakriya lagbhag kisi bhi prakaar ke polimar yaa polimar ke mishran ko sweekaar karne main sakasham he, jisame thermostate padaarth jaise valkenised rabad tair or pankhons main paae jane vaale biopolimar tathaa anya apshisht krishi utpaada shaamil hai
 Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can also make polymers with fuel
 is prakaar kaa ek pramukh sanyantr karthej, misuri, sanyukt rajya america main maujuud he jo input padaarth ke rup main turki se praapt hone vaale kachare kaa prayog karata he
 Gasification is also a similar process, but technically it is not recycling because polymers are unlikely to form as a final result
 taap sampeedan ek or prakriya he jo nai companiyon lokapriy ho rahi he
 The heat compression process uses all types of unsealed, clean plastic of all varieties, ranging from soft plastic bags to hard industrial waste, and this waste is added to the tumbler / drum
 is vidhi kaa sabase bada laabh yah he ki keval mili juli kismon kii bajaae sabhi kismon ke plastic ricycling karne yogya hote he
 However, this process is criticized for the energy expended in mounting the drums and heating the post-melt pipes
 ek aisi prakriya bhi viksit kii gai he jisame kai kismon ke plastic kaa upyog scrap steel kii ricycling main carbon strot ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 After consumption, polyethylene is sorted according to various colors, cleaned and prepared for processing
 upabhokta dwaara upbhog karne ke pashchaat is chante hue piiti kachare ko kuchlaa jaataa he, paraton main kaata jaataa he, gatthar ke rup main dabaaya jaataa he or bikri ke liye pesh kiya jaataa he
 Another use of recycled PET, which has only recently begun to become popular, is used in the textile industry to make textiles
 ye kapade piiti gucchhon kii katai dwaara banaaye jate hai
 This is done in as simple a manner as making polyester with brand new PET
 ricycle kiye gaye piiti dhaage yaa soot ko akele yaa duusare reshon ke saath istemaal karke iskaa upyog bade paimaane par vividh prakaar ke kapadon kaa utpaadan karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Traditionally, these fabrics were used to produce strong, durable, rigid products such as jackets, coats, shoes, bags, caps and other items
 However, these clothes are usually very dry to the skin and can cause irritation
 isliye, aamtaur par ve kisi bhi us paridhaan main prayog main nahin laaye jate jo twachaa ko rukha kar sakate hai, yaa phir jahaan aaramdaayak kapadon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But today the demand for "green" products is increasing in the new environmentally friendly world
 parinamswaroop, kapadaa banane vaali kai companiyon ne is nae bazaar main laabh praapt karne ke tareeke dhundne shuru kar die hai or ricycle kiye gaye piiti kapade ko prayog main laane ke liye nai khoje viksit kerani shuru kar di hai
 These discoveries include processing fabrics in a variety of ways, using fabrics, or blending fabrics with other materials
 kuch kapade jo is udyog kii in khojon main sabase agrani hai, main bilabong kaa iko-supreme swead, livity kaa rip-tide III, wellman ink kaa iko-faai ke naam se janaa jaataa tha) or revare kaa revuvan shaamil hai
 Some more companies that take pride in using recycled PET in their materials include Crazy Shirts and Playback
 audyogic str par pivisi yaa vinil ricycling karnaa aitihaasik rup se bahut kathin rahaa he
 But within the last decade many practical methods of recycling or upcycling PVC plastic have been developed
 sabase adhik baar ricycle hone vaala plastic, echdipii yaa sankhya 2 dwaara plastic ke latthe, megen, sadak ke kinare ke footpath, bench, trek cargo liner, kachare ke dibbe, steshnari or anya tikaoo plastic utpaada or aam taur maang main rahane vaali vasteen banaai jaati he
 White plastic foam grains used as packing materials are often reused by shipping stores
 israel main hue safal pareekshanon se pataa chalaa he ki mishrit saarvajanik kachare ke strot se praapt kii gai plastic filmon se baltiyon jaisi upyogi gharelu samagriyaan banaai ja sakati hai
 Similarly, agricultural plastic products such as mulch film, drip tape and silage bags are being released from waste sources and are successfully recycled to make industrial application products, such as plastic composite railroad ties
 Historically, these agricultural plastic products were formerly suppressed in the ground or burnt in a particular individual's field
 sienen ne report di he ki kerala rajmarg anusandhan santhaan, bharat kii dow es madhu ne sadak kii aisi sataha taiyaar kii he jisame ricycle kiye gaye plastic kaa prayog hota he
 It consists of bitumen and sliced plastic and is melted at a temperature of less than 220 ° c to avoid contamination
 aisa daawa kiya jaataa he ki is tarah se bani sadak kii sataha bahut hi tikaoo tathaa monsoon varsha pratirodhi he
 Plastic sorting is done manually, which is very economical in India
 lagbhag 500 meter lambii, 8 meter chaudee, do-len kii pareekshan sadak par 60 kilo plastic laga tha
 In 2008, PET prices in the US fell from $ 370 / tonne to $ 20 in November
 
 may 2009 main piiti keemten apni dirghakaalik ausat kii barabari par ain thim
 Plastic recycling rates are much lower than other items such as newspapers and corrugated fiber boards
 2005 main sabhi plastic kii botalon kii ricycling dar 24% thi
 The recycling rate of plastics received after use has increased every year since 1990
 2006 main plastic kii botalon kii ricycling kii dar 2
2 trillian pound ke record str tak pahunch gayi thi
 Recycling of PET bottles exceeded 102 million pounds in 2006 compared to 2005
 2005 main echdipii botalon kii ricycling kii sankhya 928 million pound tak bad gai thi
 The national plastics recycling rate is low due to the complexity of sorting and processing, adverse economics, and consumer confusion about the type of plastic to be recycled
 kuch bhram aam taur par sabhi plastic vastuon par prayukt hone vaale ricycling chihn ke kaaran he
 This sign is called a resin identification code
 yah chihn dibbon kii tali par muhar ke rup main lagaaya jaataa he yaa mudrit kiya jaataa he or yah tiron ke ek trikon se ghira hua hota he
 The purpose of these arrows was to make plastic identification easier for recycling
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki ricycling chihn hone se koi vastu residential ricycling kaaryakramon dwaara sweekaar kar lee jaaegi
 In the UK, due to the lack of recycling facilities, the amount of plastic recycled after use is relatively small
 2009 main plastic udyog dwaara british janata ko plastic ke upyog, punah upyog or niptaan sambandhit ek rashtravyapee bahes main shaamil karne ke uddeshy ke saath plastic 2020 chalange kaarykram kii shuruyaat kii gayi thi, jo apni website par apshisht padanukram par kendrit online bahes shrinkhlaayein yojit karata he
 Seven groups of plastic polymers are used for packaging applications worldwide, each of which has distinct characteristics
 Each group's plastic polymer can be identified by its plastic identification mark — often an abbreviation of a number or letter
 udhaaharan ke liye, lo-density poliethylin ko sankhya 4 or / yaa "aldipii / LDPE" aksharon se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The PIC is displayed inside a recycling symbol of one to three arrows behind it
 pratik se yah pataa lagata he ki kya is plastic kaa prayog nae utpaadon ke punarnavinikaran main kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 PIC was initiated by the Plastics Industry Association which provides a uniform system for identifying different types of polymer varieties and helps recycling companies to separate different types of plastics for reprocessing
 kuch deshon / kshetron main plastic utpaadon ke nirmaataaon ke liye piaisi labalon kaa prayog karnaa aavashyak he or jahaan inhen lagane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he, vahaan ve swechha se apane utpaadon par is chihn kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 With the help of a code usually found on the underside or end of plastic products, consumers can identify the variety of plastic, these products include food / chemical packing and cans
 aamtaur par packaging filmon main piaisi ko pradarshit nahin kiya jaataa kyonki is prakaar ke kachare ko ekatrit karnaa or ricycle karnaa vyavhaarik nahin he
