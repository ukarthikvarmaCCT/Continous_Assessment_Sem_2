 apvaah, vashpikaran or risaav sabhi ek nishchit samay par mitti kii santrupti par atyaadhik nirbhar karte hai
 To solve the equation, the evaporation-emission rate as a function of soil moisture must be known
 Generally, after a certain saturation according to the sample that describes it, evaporation will depend only on climatic factors such as available sunlight
 Upon reaching below this point, soil moisture controls evaporation and begins to decrease until the soil reaches a point where no more water is allowed for vegetation
 This level of soil is generally called the "permanent relaxation point"

 nandavansh pracheen bharat kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee evam mahaan nyaayi athwa nai rajvansh tha
 Who ruled the vast part of northern India in the fifth-fourth century BC
 nandavansh kii sthapana pratham chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ne kii thi
 For the first time in Indian history, an empire was established whose boundaries extended across the Gangetic plains
 yah samrajya vastutah swatantra rajyon yaa saamanton kaa shithil sangh naa hokar balki kisi shaktishaalee raja bal ke sammukh natmastak hote the
 It was an unbroken monarchy under the umbrella of Ekrat, which had immense military power, money power and manpower
 chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ne nikatavarti sabhi rajwansho ko jitkar ek vishaal samrajya kii sthapana kii evam kendriya shashan kii vyavastha lagu kii
 That is why Samrat Mahapadam Nanda is called the father of central governance
 yah samaran yogya baat he ki nandavansh ke raja apane uttaradhikariyon or bhavi pidiyon ko daan main kya de gaye ? smith ke shabdon main kahen to "unhone 66 paraspar virdohi rajyon ko is baat ke liye vivash kiya ki vah aapasi ukhaad pachhad na karen or swayan ko kisi ucchtar niamak satta ke haathon saunp de
 "undoubtedly the rise of Nando can be considered a symbol of the rise of Indian politics
 "mahanand" main kiya gaya tha isaki pushti samraat samudragupta dwaara rachit mahakavy "krishna charitra" ke praarambhik teen shloko se hoti he
 But the details of the said epic remain only
 samudr vasanaa shebhy:he aas mudamapi shriy:
 Remedy Hastaira Krisya: Then shodkrit nandasat
 
 Many details of history information are found in the Puranas, Jain and Buddhist texts and the description of Greek historians
 tathaapi itnaa nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki nand ek kshatray rajvansh tha jisaki adhikansh prakrutiyaan bhartiya shashan parampara kii thi
 Curtius states that Shakara's father was actually the son of a poor barber at the time of Alexander, from the accounts of Greek writers it is known that he was the "present king" Agramas or Jandramas, who are identified with Dhanananda
 uskaa pita mahapadmanand tha, jo curtius ke upyukt kathan se kshatriya varna kaa thahartaa he
 In some Purana texts and Jain texts "appendix Parva", he is also called the son of Naipit
 in anek sandarbhon se keval ek baat spasht hoti he ki nandavansh ke raja nyaay kshatriya varna ke the
 He was the first and best-known king of Nandavansh
 puranagranth uski ginati shaishunagvansha main hi karte hai, kintu buddha or jain anutrutiyon main use ek nae vansh kaa prarambhkarta mana gaya he, jo sahi he
 He is also called Ugrasena in Jain texts and Mahapadmapati in Puranas
 puraanon ke kaliyugarajavrittantavle anshon main use atibali, mahakshatrantic or or parashuram kii sangyaayen di gai hai
 It is clear that the king with very large army, after destroying many contemporary Kshatriya dynasties, demonstrated his force
 yah aashcharya nahin ki us apaar dhan or sainyashakti se usne himalay or narmada ke bich ke saare pradeshon ko jeetne kaa upkram kiya
 His conquered territories included Akshvaku, Panchal, Kauravya, Kashi, Haihay, Ashmak, Vitihotra, Kalinga, Shursen, Mithila, and many other states
 himalay or vindhyachal ke bich kahin bhi uske shasno kaa ulanghan nahin ho saktaa tha
 Thus he ruled the whole earth as "erat

 Much information about the queens of Mahapadmananda is not available
 puraanon main mahapadmanand ke das putr uttaradhikari bataae gaye hai
 See their names there gangan paal, panduk, pandugati, bhootpal, rashtrapal, govishanak, dashasiddhak, kaivart or dhananand, chand nand Chandragupta Maurya was the son of the monarch Chakravarti Emperor Mahapadmananda of the Nanda dynasty, whose real name was Chandranand, whose mother was from a Brahmin family, Mahapadmananda was followed by his son Dhanananda, who feared Sikandar
 dhananand ne mantri chanakya ko petakar sabha se isaliye baahar nikaala diya chanakya dhananand se pehle singhaasana par baith gayi the 
 Chanakya provoked Dhananand's half-brother Chandranand to kill Dhananand by deceiving Chandranand and made Chandranand Crow king and named Chandranand Crow as Chandragupta Maurya
 puraanon ke sumalya ko buddha granthon main ullikhit mahapadam ke atirikt anya aath naamon main kisi se mila sakna kathin prathit hota he
 But all together were called Navanand in terms of numbers
 isamen koi vivaad nahin
 In the Puranas, the reign of all of them is told for 100 years - Mahapadmananda for 88 years and his sons for 12 years
 kintu ek hi vyakti 88 varshon tak rajya karata rahe or uske baad ke kramagat 8 raja keval 12 varshon tak hi rajya karen, yah buddhigrahya nahin prathit hota
 The reign of the Nawanandas in the Sinhalese rituals is stated to be 40 years and we can consider it right

 It is certain that the last king among them was the king of Magadha at the time of Alexander's invasion, Agramas (son of Ugrasen), whose Greek soldiers, fearing the huge and powerful armies, refused to proceed after the battle with Porus
 plutark kahata he ki chandragupta maury ne sikandar se milakar uski nichkulotpatti or janata main apriyata kii baat kahi thi
 It is possible that Chandragupta has also tried to use that foreign invader to overthrow Dhanananda
 "mahavanshatika" se gyaat hota he ki antim nand kathor shaasha tathaa lobhi or kripan swabhaav kaa vyakti tha
 Probably due to this greedy nature, he was called Dhanananda
 usne chanakya kaa apmaan bhi kiya tha
 This is confirmed by the play Mudrarakshasa, which suggests that Chanakya was removed from his post
 apamaanit hokar usne nand samrajya ke unmoolan kii shapath lee or rajkumaar chandragupta maury ke sahyog se use us kaary main safalataa mili
 Both of them prepared a huge army from the regions of Punjab for that task, which probably also included some foreign elements and robbers
 yah bhi gyaat hota he ki chandragupta ne dhananand ko ukhaad phenkane main parvatak se bhi sandhi kii thi
 He made two attacks on Magadha, it seems correct, but the "divyavadaan" obedience that he first attacked Magadha's capital Pataliputra and failed and he and Chanakya had to flee to save their lives, Does not seem right

 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 isamen unhone muslim lig kii musalamaanon ke liye ek alag desh pakistan kii maang kii aalochana kii
 It also argued that Hindus should accept Muslims from Pakistan
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 which is a cruel tactic to enslave and suppress humanity and its proper name will be slander
 ek sabhyataa ke bare me or kya kaha ja saktaa he jisane logon ke ek bahut bade varg ko viksit kiya jise


 ek maanav se hin samajha gaya or jiskaa sparsh maatr pradooshan failaane kaa paryaapt kaaran he? Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia
 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"
 unhone kaha haalaanki pardaa hinduon me bhi hota he par use dharmik manyata keval musalamaanon ne di he
 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity
 unka kahana tha ki manushya inhen baton ko shubh tathaa aanandit jivan ke liye chahta he
 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he
 He got all these things in the only Buddhism
 gandhi va congress kii katu aalochana ke baavjood ambedkar kii pratishtha ek adwitiya vidwaan or vidhivetta kii thi jiske kaaran jab, 15 agast 1947 main bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad, congress ke netritv vaali nai sarkaar astitv main ai to usne ambedkar ko desh ke pehle kaanoon evam nyaay mantri ke rup main seva karne ke liye aamantrit kiya, jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 On 29 August 1947, Ambedkar was appointed to the post of Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the creation of the new Constitution of independent India
 is kaary main ambedkar kaa shuruaati buddha sangh ritiyon or anya buddha granthon kaa adhyayan bhi kaam aayaa
