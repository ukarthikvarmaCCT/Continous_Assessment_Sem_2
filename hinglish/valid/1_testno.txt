 musalmaan maanate hai ki ise allaah ne farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko sunaaya tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran is the last and supreme book sent by Allah
 yah granth lagbhag 1400 saal pehle avataran hui he
 According to the beliefs of Islam, Hazrat Muhammad was revealed by the Qur'an Allah's angel Jibril until his death in 61032
 haalanki aarambh main iskaa prasar maukhik rup se hua par pigambar mohammad kii maut ke baad san 633 main ise pehali baar likhaa gaya tha or san 653 main ise manakikrut kar isaki pratiyaan islamic samrajya main vitarit kii gayi thi
 Muslims believe that the last of the holy messages sent by God are written in the Quran
 in sandeshon kii shuruyaat aadam se hui thi
 Hazrat Adam was the earliest prophet in Islamic beliefs and can be compared to an extent with the Manu of Hinduism
 jis tarah se hindu dharm main manu kii santanon ko maanav kaha gaya he vaise hi islam main aadam kii santanon ko aadmi kaha jaataa he
 Tauheed, religious order, Jannat, Jahannam, Patience, Dharma are subjects of perenniality which were repeated again and again
 koran ne apane samay main ek sidhe saadhe, nek vyapaaree insaan ko, jo apane parivaar main ek bharpoor jivan guzaar rahaa tha
 He stood before the two great powers of the world
 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi iske nishaan pakke milte hai
 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today
 musalamaanon ke anusaar kuran main die gaye gyaan se ye sabit hota he ki hazarat mohammad ek islamic pigambar nabi he | The first mention of the word "qur'an" is found in the Qur'an itself where it means - he read, or he read
 yah shabd iske syrian samanaantar courienna kaa arth letaa he jiskaa arth hota he granthon ko padhanaa
 Although Westernists associate it with the Syrian word, most Muslims believe that its root is the word Qur'a
 par chaahe jo hazarat mohammad ke janmdin ke samay hi yah ek arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 The word has been mentioned some 70 times in the Qur'an itself
 iske alaave bhi koran ke kai naam hai
 It has also been addressed by names such as Al Furaqan, Al Hikmah, Dhikr / Zikr and Mashhaf
 koran main allaah ne 25 ambia kaa zikr kiya he
 The word Quran appears about 70 times in the Quran, which assumes different meanings
 yah arabi kriya qara kaa ek maukhik sangya he, jiskaa arth he "vah padhata he"
 Syriac is the equivalent qarayana, which refers to "reading scripture" or "lesson"
 jabaki kuch pashchimi vidwaan is shabd ko siriek se praapt karne par vichaar karte hai, muslim adhikariyon ke bahumat main shabd kii utpatti qara hi hoti he
 Regardless, it had become an Arabic word during Muhammad's lifetime
 shabd kaa ek mahatvapurn arth "paath kaa kaary" he, jaisaa ki praarambhik kurani maarg main darshaya gaya he: "yah hamaare liye ise ikattha karnaa or ise padhanaa he 
 In other verses, the term refers to "a personal passage"
 iskaa kai sandarbh main kai prakaar se adab kiya jaataa he
 As an example: "when al-quran is recited, listen to it and be silent
 " anya dharmon ke granth jaise torah or susamachar ke saath varnit arth bhi grahan kar saktaa he
 The word also has synonyms which are employed throughout the Quran
 prayek samanaarthi kaa apana alag arth hota he, lekin iskaa upyog kuch sandarbhon main quran ke saath mil saktaa he
 In such words the book, Ayah; And sura
 baad ke do shabd bhi prakaashan kii ikaayiyon ko darshaate hai
 In the large majority of references, usually with a definite article, the term is referred to as "publication", which has been "sent" at intervals
 anya sambandhit shabd hai: dhikkaar, quran ko ek anusmarak or chetavanee ke arth main sanderbhit karata he, or hikmah, kabhi-kabhi prakaashan yaa iske hisse kaa zikr karata he
 The Quran describes itself as "prudence", "mother of texts", "guide", "wisdom", "remembrance"
 or "rahasyodghatan" 
 Another word is al-kitab, although it is also used in Arabic for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible
 musahaf shabd kaa prayog aksar vishesh kuranik lipiyon ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he lekin quran main bhi pehle kii kitabon kii pahchaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation during his prayer in the cave of Hira on the mountains
 iske baad, unhen 23 varshon kii avadhi main puraa koran kaa khulaasa praapt hua
 According to the hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad came to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to read the Quran and learn and teach the laws, which were told daily
 yah sambandhit he ki kuch kurash jinhen badr kii ladaai main kaidiyon ke rup main le jaaya gaya tha, unhone kuch musalamaanon ko us samay ke saral lekhan ko sikhaye jane ke baad apni aazaadee hasil kar lee
 Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate
 jaisaa ki shuru main kaha gaya tha, quran ko takhton, khaalon, haddiyon, or ke tane ke chaude lakadiyon par darj kiya gaya tha
 Most suras were in use among Muslims as they have been mentioned in many hadiths and histories by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating to Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, as a way of praying and reading
 haalanki, quran 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke samay pustak rup main maujuud nahin tha
 There is an agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write the revelation
 sahih al-bukaari haddees main mohammad ko rahasyodghatan kaa varnan karte hue bataaya, "kabhi-kabhi yah ghanti bajane kii tarah " or aaisha ne bataaya, "maine dekha ki paigambar bahut hi thande din main vahi se prerit ho rahe hai or unke maathe se pasinaa nikal rahaa tha
 As soon as the inspiration of the same was over, his restlessness would go away
 " quran ke anusaar mohammad kaa pehla prakaashan, ek drushti ke saath tha
 The medium of revelation is described as "a powerful one", a person who was "on the topmost horizon when clear to see
 phir vah nikat aa gaya or mohammad se baat karne laga
 "islamic study scholars state in the Welch encyclopedia that they believe that Muhammad's condition and descriptions at these moments can be considered real, as he was severely disturbed after these revelations
 velch ke mutabik, mohammad kii preranaon kii atimanvi utpatti ke liye unke aas-paas ke logon ne in daure ko dekha hoga
 However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a person, a poet, or a magician because his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures in ancient Arabia
 velch atirikt rup se bataata he ki yah anishchit he ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke praarambhik daawey se pehle yaa baad main ye anubhav hue the
 The Quran describes Muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "uneducated", but its meaning is more complex
 madhyakaalin tippaneekaron jaise al-tabari ne kaha ki is shabd ne do arthon ko prerit kiya: pehla, saamaanya rup se padhane yaa likhane main asamarthta; doosraa, pichhali kitabon yaa granthon kii anubhavheenata yaa agyanta 
 Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as an indication of the reality of his prophecy
 udhaaharan ke liye, fakhruddin al-raji ke anusaar, yadi mohammad ne lekhan or padhai main maharath hasil kii thi to sambhawatah unhen purvajon kii kitabon kaa adhyayan karne kaa andeh hota
 Some scholars, like Watt, prefer the second meaning of "ummi" - they first take it to indicate unfamiliarity with sacred texts
 quran kii antim aayat varsh 10veen hijri main dhu al-hijjah ke islamic maheene ke 18 veen tarikh ko prakat hui thi, jo ek taarikh he jo mote taur par farvari yaa march 632 se mail khaati he 
 This was revealed after the Prophet gave his sermon in Ghadir e Khumm
 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, unke kai saathi jo quran ko kanthst jaanate the, musalimaa dwaara yamama kii ladaai main maare gaye the
 The first Khalifa, Abu Bakr, later decided to gather the book into a book to preserve it
 zayd ebn thabit quran ko ikattha karne vaale pehle vyakti the kyonki vah allaah ke nabi mohammad se padhe gaye aaayaaton or suron ko likhaa karte the
 Thus, the most important of the classical group, Zaid bin Thabit, collected verses and compiled the entire book to give the Qur'an the form of a book
 is tarah quran ek granth ke rup main aagai or uski prati abu bakr ke saath hi rahi
 For this work, Zaid has cropped all the pages which were written on the bone, on the leaves, on the stones and many people had memorized them
 abu bakar ke baad, mohammad kii vidhwaa hafasa bint umr ko lagbhag 650 main is pandulipi ko saunpa gaya tha
 The third Caliph Uthman ibn Afan began to notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Quran as Islam spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa
 paath kii pavitrataa ko sangrakshit karne ke liye, unhone jayad kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa aadesh diya taaki abu bakar kii pratilipi kaa upyog kiya ja sake or quran kii ek maanak prati taiyaar kii ja sake
 Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed in written form
 yah paath us model ban gaya jahaan se muslim duniya ke shahari kendron main pratiyaan banaai gayi or prakshepit kii gayi, or anya sanskarnon ko nasht kar diya gaya mana jaataa he
 The current form of Quran recitation is considered by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr
 shiya ke anusaar, ali ebn abi talib ne mohammad kii mrityu ke turant baad quran kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The sequence of this text was gathered later during Uthman's era that this version was collected in chronological order
 iske baavjood, unhone manakikrut quran ke khilaaf koi aapatti nahin kii or quran ko parisancharan main sweekaar kar liya
 Other individual copies of the Quran may exist, including the codecs of Ibn Mas'ud and Ube ibn Ka'b, none of which exist today
 quran mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bikhri hui likhit rup main sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Several sources indicate that a large number of his companions had missed the revelation during Muhammad's lifetime
 praarambhik tippaniyan or islamic aitihaasik strot quran ke shuruaati vikaas kii uparyukt samaj kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Quran in its current form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad as the discovery of variants has not given much importance
 chicago vishvavidhyalay ke professor fred donor ne kaha ki "


 quran ke ek samaan vyanjan paath ko sthapit karne kaa ek bahut hi shuruaati prayaas tha, jo sambhawatah sancharan main sambandhit granthon kaa ek vyapak or adhik vividh samooh tha
 After the creation of this standardized canonical text, the first official texts were suppressed, and all existing manuscripts — despite their many variants — seem to date back to a time after the establishment of this standard consonant text
 " haalanki quran ke paath ke adhikansh sanskaran reeding ko prasaarit karnaa band kar diya gaya he, kuch abhi bhi hai
 There has been no significant text on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text can be based
 aitihaasik rup se, quran kii saamagree par vivaad shaayad hi kabhi ek mudda ban gaya he, haalanki is vishay par bahes jari he
 In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that later proved to be the oldest Quranic text existing at the time
 sanaa kii pandulipiyon main ek prishth he jisamen se charmpatr pun: prayojya banane ke liye dhoyaa gaya he- ek abhyaas jo pracheen samay main lekhan saamagree kii kami ke kaaran aam tha
 However, the faint washed-out underlying text is still barely visible and is considered "pre-uthmanic" Quranic content, while the text written at the top is considered Uthmanic time
 radiocarbon dating kaa upyog karne vaale adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki charmpatr 671 sii se pehle kii avadhi ke liye 99 pratishat sambhaavna ke saath dinaankit hai
 In 2015, very early Quran fragments dating back 1370 years were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England
 oxford uniwarsity radiocarbon excelerator unit dwaara kiye gaye pareekshanon ke mutabik, "95% se adhik kii sambhaavna ke saath, charmpatr 568 or 645 ke bich tha"
 The manuscript is written in the Hijaji script, an early form of Liza Arabic
 yah sambhawatah quran kaa sabase purana udhaaharan he, lekin pareekshanon kii ek vistrut taarikh kii anumati he, isliye yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa ki maujuuda sanskarnon main se koun sa sabase purana he
 Saudi scholar Saud al-sarhan has expressed doubts over the age of the fragments because they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later
 muslimon kaa maananaa he ki quran 23 saal kii avadhi main allaah ne jibril ke madhyam se ishwar se mohammad se divya maargdarshan kii pustak ban gaya he or quran ko maanavtaa ke liye bhagwaan ke antim prakaashan ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Revelation in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing a person, sending a message to a large number of recipients
 jis prakriya se ishwar ke sandeshvahak ke dil main divine sandesh aata he vah tanzil yaa nuzul he
 As the Quran states, "with the truth we have sent it down and with the truth it has come down
 " The Quran often emphasizes in its text that it is divinely ordained
 quran main kuch chand yah ingit karte hai ki arabi bolne vaale bhi log quran ko samajhenge agar unhen sunaaya jaataa he
 The Quran refers to a written pre-text, "protected tablet", which records the speech of God even before it is sent
 quran shaashvat yaa banaaya gaya mudda yah mudda nauveen shatabdi main ek dharmik bahes ban gaya
 Mu'tazilas, an Islamic school of theology based on logic and rational thought, stated that the Quran was created, while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore unskilled
 sufi darshanik is sawaal ko kritrim yaa galat tareeke se taiyaar karte hai
 Muslims believe that the current word of the Quran is revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran 15: 9, it is protected from corruption
 muslim quran ko maardarshak maanate hai, mohammad kii bhavishyavaanee or dharm kii sachai kaa sanket
 The uniqueness of the Quran is the belief that the Quran cannot be compared to any human dialect or any material
 quran ko musalamaanon dwaara ek athulaneey chamatkaar mana jaataa he, jo yom al-qiyama ke din tak prabhavi hota he, or is prakaar, mohammad ko unke bhavishyavaaniyon kii sthiti ke pramanikaran main kendriya pramaan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 The concept of indispensability arises in the Quran, where in five different verses, opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: "if humans and jinn are bound together to produce a voice like this Quran" So they will never be able to do this, if they can support themselves with each other and see
 " to suzav yah he ki yadi quran ke divya lekhakatv se sambandhit andeh hai, to aage aaen or aisa kuch banaaen
 From the ninth century, many people and works appeared that studied the Quran and examined its style and content
 al-jurjani or al-baqillani sahit madhyayugin muslim vidwaanon ne is vishay par kai granthon ko likhaa he, iske vibhinn pahaluon par charchaa kii he, or quran kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bhashaai drushtikon kaa upyog kiya he
 Others argue that the Quran has great ideas, internal meanings, maintaining its freshness through the ages
 or quran ke zariye vyaktigat str par or itihaas main bade badlaav hue hai
 Some scholars say that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science
 quran kii chamatkarita ke siddhant par mohammad kii nirakshartaa par jor diya gaya he kyonki agyaat bhavishyadvaktaa ko quran likhane kii kshamta kaise hogi
 That is why this is the voice of God
 quran kaa pehla sura sura e fatiha dainik prarthanaaon or anya avasaron main padhaa or doharaaya jaataa he
 This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most frequently read sura of the Quran: shuru karata hoon khuda ke naam se jo bada meharbaan nihaayat raham vaala he; sab tarif khuda hi ke liye hai zo sabaqa rab ar maaliq he; or saare jahaann kaa paalane vaala bada meharbaan raham vaala he; roze jaza kaa maalik he; kudaaya ham teri hi ibaadat karte hai or tujh hi se madad chaahate hai; to hamako sidhi raah par sabit qadam rakhwa; unki raah jinhen tuune naimat ata kii he na unki raah jin par tera gazab dhaayaa gaya or na gumraahon kii
 " quran ko anya varg bhi dainik prarthanaaon main padhate hai
 Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious belief by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with respect
 parampara ke aadhaar par or quran kii ek shabdic vyakhya 56:79, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki unhen quran kii ek prati chune se pehle vazu karnaa hoga, haalanki yah vichaar nahin he saarvbhaumik
 Copies of the Purani Bosida Quran are wrapped in cloth and stored indefinitely with adab in a safe place
 kabhi masjid yaa ek muslim kabristaan main dafnaaya jaataa he, yaa jala diya jaataa he or raakh ko dafan kiya jaataa he yaa pani par bikharaa hua hota he
 In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism, and jurisprudence, are concerned with the Quran or have their foundations in their teachings
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran ke prachaar yaa padhanaa adhik praadhanyata rakhata he
 Those who preach and study it are rewarded with divine rewards
 aisa karnaa vibhinn prakaar ke ajahar, sawab yaa hasanh kaha jaataa he
 The Quran also inspired the Islamic arts and especially the so-called Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination
 quran ko chitrakaari chhaviyon se kabhi sajaayaa nahin jaataa he, lekin kai kuranon ko prishth ke margin main yaa linon ke bich yaa sure kii shuruyaat main sajaavati pattern ke saath sajaayaa jaataa he
 Islamic verses appear on many other media, buildings and objects of all sizes, such as mosque lamps for mosques or albums, on pots, pottery and pages of calligraphy

 The Quran contains 114 chapters of varying lengths, each known as a sura
 sura ko makki yaa madani ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya he, is par nirbhar karata he ki mohammad ke madina ke pravaas se pehle yaa baad main aayaat prakat kiye gaye the yaa nahin
 However, a sura classified as Madni may have a maize rectangle and vice versa

 Apart from division into suras and being independent, there are several ways to divide the Quran into parts of approximately equal length for convenience in reading

 In native Arabic, the surya and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that aid the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text
 muslim jor den ki quran kii saamagree or style anuchit he
 The language of the Quran is described as "poetry prose" because it is part of both poetry and prose; However, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of the Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others
 quran, jabaki puure quran main paaya gaya tha, pehle ke kai makka suras main vishisht he, jisamen apekshaakrit kam chand gayan ke shabdon ko pramukhataa main phenk dete hai

 Michael Bells, citing Brown's work, accepts Brown's observation that the seemingly disintegration of Quranic literary expression - its scattered or fragmented mode of sale phrase - is in fact a literary device capable of giving deep impact
 As if the intensity of the prophetic message was breaking the vehicle of human language in which it was being conveyed

 Self-referentiality is evident in those paragraphs where the Quran refers to itself as revealing itself in a self-sufficient way, as news, as a norm

 Tafsir is one of the earliest educational activities of Muslims
 quran ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jisane praarambhik musalamaanon ke liye chhandon ke arthon kaa varnan kiya tha
 Other early bodies included some of Muhammad's companions, such as 'ali ibn Abi Talib,' Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kab

 If the poem was about a historical event, some traditions of Muhammad were sometimes described to illustrate its meaning
 chunki quran shastreey arabi main boli jaati he, baad main kai islam main parivartit nahin hote the, ve hameshaa kuranik arabi ko nahin samajhate the, unhone un musalamaanon ko nahin pakadaa jo musalamaanon ke arabi main dharapravaah the or ve sulajhane se chintit the quran main vishyon ke spasht sangharsh
 Commentators who commented in Arabic explained the signs, and perhaps most importantly explained that the Quranic verses were revealed in Muhammad's prophetic career, which was appropriate for the earliest Muslim community, and which was later revealed Was done, canceling or "abrogating" Nasakh) earlier text

 The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, titled Tafsir e Kabir
 gudh vyakhya yaa sufi vyakhya quran ke aantarik arthon kaa anaavaran karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Sufism transcends the explicit point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric and spiritual dimensions of consciousness and existence
 sands ke anusaar, gudh vyakhyaayein ghoshnaatmak se adhik suchak hai, ve spashtikaran ke bajaay sanket hai
 They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each author

 Muhammad Husayn Tababatei states that according to popular explanations among later passages, tawil means that a verse has been instructed
 tawal ke virodh main, prakaashan kaa arth, shabdon ke spasht arth ke anusaar spasht he, jaisaa ki unhen bataaya gaya tha
 But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of tawil, which originally meant "to return" or "return place"
 tabatai ke vichaar main, jise taivil yaa quran kii harmenutic vyakhya kaha jaataa he, ko shabdon ke sanket ke saath chintit nahin he
 Rather, it deals with some truths and realities that are beyond the comprehension of the common part of men; Yet it is from these truths and realities that the doctrine of doctrine and the practical prohibition of the Quran continue
 vyakhya kavita kaa arth nahin he balki yah us arth ke madhyam se pargaman ke ek vishesh prakaar main paardarshee he
 There is a spiritual reality — which is the main purpose of obeying a law, or the basic purpose of describing a divine attribute — and then there is a real significance that a Quranic story refers to
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar, jo mohammad or imam jaise gyaan main dridhtaa se nihit hai, quran ke rahasyon ko jaanate hai
 According to Tabatai, the statement "no one knows its interpretation except God" remains valid without any adversary or qualification clause
 isliye, jahaan tak is kavita kaa sawaal he, quran kii vyakhya kaa gyaan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit he
 But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know to some extent the interpretation of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, sweekaarya or asweekaarya gudh vyakhyaayein hai
 Acceptable ta'wil refers to the meaning of a poem beyond its literal meaning; Rather the underlying meaning, which is ultimately known only to God and cannot be directly understood through human thought alone
 prashn main chand yahaan aane, jane, baithne, santushti, krodh or dukh ke maanviya gunon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jinhen spasht rup se bhagwaan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he 
 The unacceptable ta'wil is one where the apparent meaning of a poem "transfers" to a different meaning through a proof; This method is not without obvious discrepancies
 yadhyapi yah asweekaarya ta'vil ne kaaphi sweekruti praapt kii he, yah galat he or kuranik chhandon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The correct interpretation is that reality refers to a poem
 yah sabhi chhandon main paaya jaataa he, nirnaayak or aspasht ek jaise; yah shabd kaa arth nahin he; yah ek tathy he ki shabdon ke liye bahut shandaar he
 God has prepared them with words to bring a little to their minds; In this respect they are like stories that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the listener to clearly understand the intended idea

 For him, it is an essential idea that the Quran also has internal aspects

 So this goes for seven esoteric meanings

 ek gudh slant ke saath tippaneekaron kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa antim arth keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In contrast, Quranic literalism, followed by Salafis and Zahris, is the belief that the Quran should be taken only in its explicit meaning

 Since it would have been very expensive for most Muslims to buy a manuscript, copies of the Quran were held in mosques to make it accessible to the people

 Quranic statements on the creation of the universe and the earth, origins of human life, biology, earth science and so on have been criticized by developing theories such as foreclosure, unscientific, and scientific theories that are likely to be contradicted

 The language of the Quran was similar to the Syriac language

 One scholar has suggested that diatesiron as a gospel harmony may have given rise to the notion that the Christian gospel is a text
 quran ke avataran ke baad, or islam ke saamaanya udai, arabi varnmaala teji se ek kala rup main viksit hua
 According to Wadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago, and Mustassir Mir, Professor of Islamic Studies at Youngstown State University: mukhya kshetron jisamen quran ne arabi sahitya par dhyaan dene yogya prabhaav daalaa, ve dictionari or theme hai; anya kshetra quran ke saahitiyik pahaluon se vishesh rup se shapath, roopak, ruparekha or pratikon se sambandhit hai
 As far as the novel is concerned, one can say that Quranic words, idioms and expressions, especially "weighted" and formulaic phrases, appear in practically all genres of literature and in such abundance That it is impossible to compile his complete record
 quran ne na keval apane sandesh ko vyakt karne ke liye ek puri tarah se nai bhashaai corpus banaaya he, balki yah puraane arthon ke saath puraani, purv islamic shabdon ko bhi sampann karata he or yah un arthon se he jo bhashaa main or baad main sahitya main jaden lete hai 


 Allah has sent man to this earth as his caliph
 bhejne se purv usne har vyakti ko thik thik samajha diya tha ki ve thode samay ke liye dharti par ja rahe hai, uske baad unhen uske paas laut kar aana he
 Where he will get good or bad revenge for his actions which he did on earth
 Man has freedom to work on this earth
 dharti ke sadhano ko upyog karne kii chhot he
 There is no restriction or reward on doing good and bad work
 kintu is swatantraaa ke saath ishwar ne dharti par based manushyon ko thik us rup main jivan guzaarane ke liye ishwariya adeshon ke pahunchane kaa prabandh kiya or dharti ke har bhaag main usne apane doot bheje, jinhone manushyon tak ishwar kaa sandesh bheja
 The number of such messengers is said to be around 1,84,000
 is silsile kii antim kadi hazarat mohammad the
 No messenger will come after you, but Hazrat Jesus will spend the rest of his life on this earth again
 ishwar kii antim kitaab aapke haath main he koi or ishwariya kitaab ab nahin aegi
 His message was one, his mission was one, to teach human beings to live according to the divine command, for thousands of years of constant prophets, whether they had descended into any part of the earth
 hazaron varshon kaa samay bitne ke kaaran ishwariya adeshon main manushya apane vichaar, apni suvidha jod kar nayaa dharm bana lete or mul dharm ko vikrut kar ek aadambar khadaa kar dete or kai baar to ishwariya adeshon ke viparit kaary karte
 Because every effective person wanted to see everyone bow down before his power
 akhir antim nabi hazarat mohammad koran ke saath is dharti par aae or koran ishwar ke is chalange ke saath aayaa ki isaki raksha swayan ishwar karegaa
 a long time of 1500 years suggests that even after all the efforts of the Quranic opponents, not a single word of the Quran has been changed
 yah kitaab apane mul swaroop main pralay tak rahegi
 Along with this, the challenge of the Quran is still in place that those who do not consider it to be a divine book, they should show a complete book like this and not just a small part of it
 koran ke is rup ko jaanane ke baad yah jaan lijie ki yah kitaab rup main hazarat mohammad ko nahin di gai ki ise padhakar logon ko suna den or chhap kar har ghar main rakh den
 Rather, from time to time for 23 years, this book has emerged as per requirement and you have made the society on earth according to his orders at the will of God, as God had ordered

wales ke anusaar is dharti par pravachan to bahut die gaye kintu un pravachanon ke aadhaar par ek samaaj kii rachana pehali baar hazarat mohammad ne karke dikhaai
 It would be interesting to know here that Wales is not an Islam lover but anti-islam and his books have been published in opposition to Islam
 vaigyanik tathy jo ab tak hamen gyaat hai, koran main chupe hai or aise saikadon sthaan he jahaan lagata he ki manushya gyaan abhi us haqiqat tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Again and again the Quran gives you a feast to ponder
 zamin or aasmaan ke rahasyon ko jaanane kaa aamantran detaa hai
 a confusion ensues
 kuran ke daawey ke anusaar vah puri dharti ke manushyon ke liye or shesh samay ke liye he, kintu uske sambodhit us samay ke arab nazar aate hai
 It seems cursory that the Qur'an was only for the Arabs of that time, but whenever you reach a place when it seems that this thing is only for a particular time and country, then stop there
 Think or note it and consider it later, you will feel that every time a human being is one of every age and every terrain, and the same thing applies to them as the people of that time
 Used to apply to Arabs
 musalamaanon ke liye koran ke sambandh main badi badi kitaaben likhi gai hai or likhi ja sakati hai
 The purpose here is to give a brief introduction of the Qur'an and clarify what is right on its Ummah
 hazarat ali se rivaayat kii gai ek haddees he
 Hazrat Haris states that when i entered the mosque, i saw some people quarreling in some problems
 main hazarat ali ke paas gaya or unhen is baat kii soochna di
 Hazrat Ali ordered - Did these things happen? i said yes
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- yaad rakho maine rasul allaah se suna he
 You ordered - Beware, a big head will be raised near me, i have requested - what will be the means of getting rid of this situation? The Book of Allah
 koran kaa sara nichod is ek haddees main aa jaataa he
 The last book of Allah on the Qur'an is in line with his fame
 yah atyant aasaan he or yah bahut kathin bhi he
 Easy when it is read to remember
 yadi aap kii niyat main khot nahin he or koran se hidaayat chaahate hai to allaah ne is kitaab ko aasaan bana diya he
 This is the easiest book in the world to understand and remember
 khud koran me he 'or hamane koran ko samajhane ke liye aasaan kar diya he, to koi he ki soche or samajhe?' On the other hand, from the point of view of telescopes, it is the world's hardest book, even after spending entire life it is not possible to measure its depth
 is drushti se dekha jaae to yah ek samudr he
 Houses have passed and the miracle of the Quran still prevails
 or sadiyaan biit jaaengi kintu koran kaa chamatkaar kabhi samaapt nahin hoga
 The only easy way to get instruction is to pay attention to the persistent verses and believe in the verses that this too is from Allah
 duniya nirantar pragati kar rahi he, maanav gyaan nirantar bad rahaa he, jo koran main kal mutshabihaat tha aaj vah spasht ho chukaa he, or kal uske kuch ore bhaag spasht honge
 Similarly, two different methods have to be adopted for learning
 adeshon ke lihaaz se koran main vichaar karne vaale ko peeche kii ore yatra kerani hogi
 The meaning of the Qur'an's order was seen by theologians, scholars (tabatabai, Tabai'in)
 ) or sahaba ne iskaa kya arth liya
 Even to give himself to the steps of Hazrat Muhammad, what was the order of the Quran itself? duusari ore gyanvigyaan ke lihaaz se aage or nirantar aage vichaar karnaa hoga
 Go beyond it not just with time
 manushya ke gyaan kii sataha nirantar oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 The Quran has the highest level of science, considering that new inventions, discoveries and scientific facts can be worked on
 muajaza us chamatkaar ko kehete hai jo kisi nabi yaa rasul ke haath par ho or maanav shakti se pare ho, jis par maanav budhdi hairaan ho jaae
 In the same way, there are many more
 har yug main jab bhi koi rasul ishwariya adeshon ko maanav tak pahunchataa, tab use allaah kii ore se chamatkaar die jate the
 Hazrat Musa was granted as many miracles
 hazarat isa ko murdon ko jivit karnaa, bimaaron ko thik karne kaa muajaza diya gaya
 The real opportunity of any prophet is that which he presents with a claim
 hazarat mohammad ke haath par saikadon maajaze varnit hai, kintu jo daawey ke saath pesh kiya gaya or jo aaj bhi chamatkaar ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh maujuud he, vah he koran jiskaa yah chelenz duniya ke samaksh anuttarit he ki iske ek bhaag jaisaa hi bana kar dikhaa diya jaae
 This claim was made at many places in the Quran
 The Qur'an will be completely safe, the claim has passed 1500 years and the Qur'an is safe, completely safe
 yah siddh ho chukaa he, jo ek chamatkaar he
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran vigyaan kii kasuti par khara utraa he, or uske vaigyanik varnanon ke aage vaigyanik natmastak hai
 This is also a miracle
 1500 varsh purv arab ke registan main ek anpadh vyakti ne aisi kitaab prastut kii jo beesvin sadi ke saare sadhano ke saamne apni satyata zaahir kar rahi he
 If any other book has done this work other than the Quran, the world would like to know its name
 koran kaa yah chamatkaarik rup aaj hamaare liye he or ho saktaa he aage aane vaale samay ke liye uskaa koi or chamatkaarik rup saamne aae
 When the Quran was incarnated, its main miracle in that era was not its scientific basis
 us yug main koran kaa chamatkaar tha uski bhashaa, sahitya, vagmita, jisane apane samay ke arabon ke bhashaa gyaan ko jhakzor diya tha
 It would be appropriate to clarify here that the Arabs of that time were so proud of their language knowledge that they called the people of the rest of the world Ajami
 koran kii style ke kaaran arab ke bhashaa gyaniyon ne apane ghutane tech die
 The Quran is a book based on which a revolution was brought
 registan ke aise anpadh logon ko jinka vishwa ke nakshe main us samay koi mahatv nahin tha
 Due to the teachings of the Quran, the training of his presenter brought him to the great powers of that time and a Quranic society was created in just 23 years which the world can never answer
 aaj bhi duniya maanati he ki koran or hazarat mohammad ne ek adarsh samaaj kii rachana kii
 From this point of view, if you study the Qur'an, then you have to walk with it
 uski shiksha par amal karen
 Not only in private life but in social, political and legal areas, then all those characters mentioned in the Quran will be seen alive
 ve sari kathinaayee or ve sari pareshaani saamne ajaaengi
 If the gang rises for this work with body, mind, money, then the instruction of the Quran will guide it at every turn
 koran allaah kii rassi he
 There is a hadith described by Hazrat Zaid bin Araqam in the Tirmizi which states that the Qur'an is the rope of Allah which stretches from the ground to the Assaman
 yah shabd huzur ke he jinhe hazarat zayd ne varnit kiya he
 In the same way, there are many more
 tabraani main varnit ek or haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek din huzur masjid main tasharif laae to dekha kuch log ek kone main baithe koran pard rahe hai or ek duusare ko samajha rahe hai
 Seeing this, a wave of happiness ran over your face
 aap sahaba ke us gut ke paas pahunche or un se kaha- kya tum maanate ho ki allaah ke atirikt koi anya mabood nahin he, main allaah kaa rasul hun or koran allaah kii kitaab he? sahaba ne kaha, yaa rasul allaah ham gavaahi dete hai ki allaah ke atirikt koi mabood nahin, aap allaah ke rasul hai or koran allaah kii kitaab he
 Then you said, rejoice that the Quran is the rope of Allah with one end in his hand and the other in your hand
 The Qur'an is also the rope of Allah in the sense that it binds the Muslims together
 unamem vichaaron kii ekta, mat bhinnata ke samay allaah ke adeshon se nirnay or jivan ke liye ek adarsh namoona prastut karata he
 In the same way, there are many more
 khud koran main he ki allaah kii rassi ko majbuti se pakad lo
 There is no conflict between any faction of Muslims on the basis of the Quran
 koran kaa haq koran ke har musalmaan par paanch haq hai, jo use apni shakti or samarthy ke anusaar purna karnaa chahie
 To understand the Quran, it is important to know the background of its incarnation
 yah is tarah kii kitaab nahin he ki ise puraa likh kar pigambar ko dekar kah diya gaya ho ki jaao isaki ore logon ko bulaao
 Rather, on the occasion of the Quran, which was started by Arab Muhammad in Arabia, the Qur'an was descended according to necessity
 aarambh se jaise hi koran kaa kuch bhaag avatarit hota aap use likhva dete or yah bhi bataa dete ki yah kiske saath padhaa jayega
 In order of incarnation, scholars have divided the Quran into two parts
 ek makki bhaag, doosraa madani bhaag
 Initially, there were minor appearances in maize
 unki bhashaa shreshth, prabhavi or arabon kii pasand ke anusaar shreshth saahitiyik darje vaali thi
 His words used to fall in the heart
 uske daivie sangeet se kaan usko sunne main lag jate or uske daivie prakaash se log aakarshith ho jate yaa ghabara jate
 It described the laws of creation on which human wonder is still astonishing after centuries, but all examples were local for this
 unheen ke itihaas, unhi kaa maahaul
 This went on for five years
 iske baad makke kii rajnatik tathaa aarthik satta par qabze vaale logon ne apane liye is khatre ko bhaanp kaa zulm va jyaadati kaa vah tandav kiya ki musalamaanon kii jo thodi sankhya thi usamen bhi kai logon ko gharbaar chhod kar habsha janaa padaa
 The prophet himself had to be imprisoned with all the family members in a valley and eventually left Mecca and went to Medina
 musalamaanon par yah bada sakht samay tha or allaah ne is samay jo koran nazil kiya usamen talwaar kii kaat or baadh kii tezi thi
 Which shook the entire area
 musalamaanon ke liye tasalli or is kathin samay main kii jane vaali prarthanaaain hai jo is aath varsh ke koran kaa mukhya bhaag raheen
 It is clear from this violent episode that the influence of human creativity and emotions was in the composition of this book
 makki daur ke teraa varsh baad madeene main musalamaanon ko ek kendra praapt ho gaya
 Where all the believers gathered and the incarnation of the third round began
 yahan musalamaanon kaa do nae prakaar ke logon se parichay hua
 The first Jews who had been inhabited here for centuries and according to their religious faith were waiting for the last prophet
 kintu antim nabi ko unhone apane atirikt duusari qaom main dekha to utpaat machaa diya
 During this period in the Quran, strict comments were made in the Quran on the book Ahle
 isi yug main kutachariyon kaa ek gut musalamaanon main paidaa ho gaya jo musalmaan hone kaa naatak karte or virodhiyon se mili rahat It was here that the Muslims got the permission for the armed struggle and they had to constantly face the attacks of the Meccans
 duusari ore ek islamic rajya kii sthapana ke saath puure samaaj kii rachana ke liye ishwariya niyam avatarit hue
 War, peace, justice, social customs and food, God's command of all are characteristic of the Qur'an of this era
 jinke aadhaar par samaajik barabari kaa ek adarsh rajya allaah ke rasul ne khadaa kar diya
 On the basis of this, even today, the order of Hazrat Muhammad is considered to be the first among the world heroes
 unhone jivan ke har kshaitra main zabaani nirdesh nahin die, balki us par amal karke dikhaaya
 Due to this background, the same thing has to be repeated many times in the Quran
 akeshwarwad, dharmik aadesh, swarg, narak, sabar , dharm parayanata ke vishay hai jo baar baar dohraye gaye
 The Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years the pursuit of this civilization on the whole world cannot be rescued
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 a few years ago, a group of Arabs collected verses from the Qur'an relating to the scriptures and translated them into English, Prof
 Presented to Dr
 Keith Moore, Professor of Embryology and Head of the University of Toronto
 is samay vishwa main bhrun shaastra ke sarvocch gyaata maane jate hai
 They were asked to present their views on the verses related to embryology in the Quran
 unhone unka adhyayan karne ke pashchaat kaha ki bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main koran main varnan thik aadhunik khojon ke anuroop hai
 Regarding some verses, he said that he cannot call it wrong or right because he himself is unaware of it
 isamen sabase pehle nazil kii gai koran kii vah aayat bhi shaamil thi jiskaa anuwaad he
 Take the name of your family and study, who created it
 jisane insaan ko khun kii footki se banaaya
 In this, a word has been used in Arabic language, it has one meaning of blood foot and the other means like leech
 dow
 moore ko us samay tak yah gyaat nahin tha ki kya mata ke garbh main aarambh main bhrun kii surat jonk kii tarah hoti he
 He conducted his experiments on this and after study said that initially in the mother's womb, the fetus is in the shape of leech
 dow kith moore ne bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main 80 prashnon ke uttar die jo koran or haddees main varnit hai
 In the same way, there are many more
 unhi ke shabdon main, yadi 30 varsh purv mujhase yah prashn puche jate to main inamen aadhe bhi uttar nahin de paata
 Because till then science had not made so much progress in this area
 In 1981, at the Saudi Medical Conference, Dr
 Moore announced that he had come to believe that Hazrat Muhammad was a prophet of God by looking at the verses of the Qur'an's embryology
 kyon ki sadiyon purv jab vigyaan khud bhrun avasthaa main ho itani sateek baaten keval ishwar hi kah saktaa he
 Dr
 Moore has included everything in the 1982 edition of his book which is available in many languages and is taught to first-year medical students
 is kitaab ko kisi ek vyakti dwaara chikitsa shaastra ke kshaitra main likhi kitaab kaa award bhi mil chukaa he
 There are hundreds of examples that you will read continuously in this commentary of the Quran
 mat bhinnata ek etraz kiya jaataa he ki jab koran itani sidhd kitaab he to uski tikaa main hazarat mohammad se ab tak vidwaanon main mat bhinnata kyon he
 Suffice it to say here that Prophet Muhammad promoted healthy discrimination among his followers, but you did not like bigotry and factionalism on the basis of differences
 sehatmand matbhinnata samaaj kii pragati main sadaiv sahaayak hoti he or gutbandi sadaiv nuqasaan pahunchaati he
 Therefore, the differences of Islamic scholars have also helped to work in the Qur'an hadith and in the creation of an ideal society, but the damage has been caused by factionalism by developing this differences in a radical way
 shabdic vahya koran hazarat mohammad par avatarit hua vah ishwariya shabdon main tha
 It is literal, not as meaning
 yah baat isliye spashth karnaa padi ki isai shikshan sansthaaon main yah shiksha di jaati he ki vahya ishwariya shabdon main nahin hoti balki nabi ke hriday par uskaa arth aata he jo vah apane shabdon main varnit kar detaa he
 This belief is important for Christians because they could tell the truth about the changes they made in the Bible
 puraa isai or yahudi vishwa sadiyon se yah prayaas kar rahaa he ki kisi prakaar yah sidhd kar de ki koran hazarat mohammad ke shabd hai or unki rachana he
 Many books have been written about this and efforts have been made to prove it in many ways but none have been able to achieve this success so far

 It is a mistake to understand that all diseases can be diagnosed and treated with electricity
 vidyut disht yaa galevenic vidyut dhara, faradic vidyut dhara, jyavakreey vidyutdhara, tathaa ucch aavriti dhara, yaa diathermy ke rup main ho sakati he
 If the voltage and ampere of the torus is low and it is carried on the skin of any part of the body, then the flow of electric current produces reversible action, which causes the blood arteries to dilate, the blood circulation increases and the ions Access begins
 isse vishisht lavan ke yanon ko kisi vishisht utak tak pahunchaakar, unhen vahaan nikshipt kiya ja saktaa he

 Salvatore Kazimodo was an Italian poet
 1959 i0 main sahitya main nobel puraskaar vijeta
 Salvatore Kazimodo was born on 20 August 1901 in a place called Modica on the island of Sicily
 kaazimodo kii vidhivat shiksha hui thi or ve apane samay kii takneekee pragati se bhaleebhanti avgat prathit hote hai
 He was educated at a craft college in Rome and then traveled all over Italy for 10 years, working as an engineer in the service of the Italian government
 1935 main ve milan main bas gayi the or kuch dinon ke baad italian bhashaa ke praachaarya niyukt ho gaye the
 In Italy, during the days of Mussolini's dictatorship, there were litterateurs
 taanaashaahee ke patan ke baad hi unki baton ko mahatv mila or unki rachanaaon kii bhi kadra hui, jiskaa adhikansh shrey kaazimodo ko he
 Kazimodo was a poet as well as a critic and translator
 ve dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad aadhunik saamaajik samasyaon kaa varnan karne or un par prakaash daalane ke kaaran prasiddh hue
 His views were left-wing
 aarambh main unhone naatakon kii samikshaayen hi vishesh rup se likhi thim jo anek patr patrikaon main prakashit huin
 He suggested new improvements in the traditional singing method of lyrical poems and has hinted at new lines of expression
 unhone bataaya ki sangeet ke prabhaav main shabd kii apeksha dhwani or lay vishesh kaam karte hai
 Kazimodo had translations from Greek, Latin and English
 shakespeare ke tempest kaa bhi unhone anuwaad kiya tha
 Kazimodo's collection of poems has been published in five volumes, whose names are as follows: windos vista microsoft ke oparating system kii shrinkhalaa kii sabase nai kadi he or sambhawatah windos 95 ke pashchaat sabase krantikari bhi
 Although the Vista operating system has gained more popularity due to its three-dimensional graphics format and various desktop animations, it is in fact considered to be the most secure operating system ever released by Microsoft
 sanchaar or netwarking ke lihaaj se bhi yah apane se pichley aaparating system kii tulana main zyada kshamtawan he
 Hindi support for Vista is also fully available and through the Hindi Language Interface Pack, Windows Vista can be fully painted in Hindi
 computer upyogkartaaon ke man main jigyaasa he ki kya sachmuch unhen microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya nayaa oparating system windos vista apnaane kii jarurat he
 Does Microsoft's previous operating systems Windows XP Windows 2003 and Windows 2000 have such features that it is not possible to ignore
 microsoft kaa daawa he ki vista pichley windos kii tulana main adhik sakasham, saral, tej, sudarshan or surakshit he
 Vista opens and closes faster than previous operating systems
 start ap or shat down prakriyaayein paanch se das second main puri ho jaati hai
 Although Vista's relatively better hardware also contributes to this, special efforts have been made in the code of the operating system itself

 One of the first things to get noticed in Windows Vista is its beautiful vocal and graphic effects called Windows Aero
 haalaanki maikintosh computer par is tarah ke sudarshan graphics pehle se hi maujuud hai lekin windos plateform par ye pehali baar 'vista' ke madhyam se hi saamne aae hai
 On computers with Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions that have a good graphics adapter, Aero's stunning graphics effects can be enjoyed
 is mukhaawaran ne windos kaa kalevar hi badal diya he or use pehle kii tulana main behad aakarshak, vividhtapurna or shaleen bana diya he
 Aero's high quality graphics and visual effects enhance the beauty of a Windows computer but it does not impair the functionality or speed of the computer

 Microsoft has paid special attention to this in Vista
 haalaanki vista kii mul 'karnel' to nae sire se nahin likhi he lekin uski suraksha ko is baar bahut majboot bana diya gaya he
 First of all, now not all parts of this operating system run in kernel mode, but only a select few of them run
 vista main zyaadaatar driver or software yujar mod main chalate hai or karnel mod main kisi bhi na cheez ko install karnaa aasaan nahin rah gaya he
 This requires security certificate and administrator level rights
 or administrator str ke visheshadhikaar praapt karnaa, visheshkar daftaron main, ab bahut mushkil hoga
 Windows Vista has limited common user rights
 aisa bhi nahin he ki aap bataur saamaanya upyogkarta ke apane computer main ko software instaal hi na kar paaen
 To do this, they get the necessary rights temporarily
 microsoft ne vista aaparating system install karne ke lihaaj se computaron kii do shreniyan banaai hai- vista capable pisi or vista premium ready 
 All such computers are Windows Vista enabled with at least 800 mhz processor and 512 MB system memory available
 is tarah ke procesar to ab durlabh se ho gaye hai kyonki bazaar main 2 gigahatrj se kam ke procesar shaayad hi koi kharid rahaa ho
 If you have bought your computer in the last two years, then its processor will have at least this much capacity
 rahi system memri kii baat to ho saktaa he ki aapke paaramparik computer main 128 embi yaa 256 embi memri lagi ho
 In such a situation, you may have to upgrade your RAM by spending seven to eight hundred rupees

 During this period, it is important that you look after your children being well
 apane dam par cypo virus ek rog jivan dhamkee nahin he
 However, when it merges with other types of viruses like rotavirus and line smoking policies, it forms a serious form of stomach flu, which is also commonly referred to as gastroenteritis in both adults and children
 It is possible
 ooshmaayan avadhi jo cypo virus ke saath marz he virus ke prakaar par nirbhar karte hue bhinn ho sakati he
 The cypo virus line merges with smoking policies, when incubation periods can range from 1-3 days
 is sandarbh main ooshmaayan avadhi samay virus ke lakshan abhivyakti se pehle sharir main sup t rahati he dekhen
 During the incubation period, the patient is not able to transmit the disease

 Although it is true that small electromagnetic waves, such as X, gamma, and cosmic radiation also produce chemical effects in substances, the primary effect of all these waves is ion production
 prakaash rasayan main unheen prakashtarangon ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jinke dwaara vighatan yaa sakriyan hota he
 The longitudinal limits of these light waves range from 10,000 to 1,800 to the normal

 Light is energy
 yah urja isaki tarangon kii aavriti tathaa tivrata par nirbhar karti he
 The unit of light energy will be the value of "photon" or quantum hn; h is called the "plankstank", its value is 6
62 ′ 10E-27 erg
 Seconds
 agar aavriti adhik hui to prakaash tarang main urja bhi adhik hogi
 When a chemical system absorbs light, this energy is either converted to heat or emitted in the form of resonance, fluorescence or phosphorescence radiation, or the chemical action in the absorbed energy system
 padaarthon dwaara prakaash kaa avasorana "lambert ke avasorana niyam" ke anusaar hota he
 Lambert found in experiments in 1760 that layers of thickness equal to a homogeneous absorbing medium absorb an equal proportion of the intensity of light passing through them
 is niyam ko nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara prakat karte hai : Ia = Ii exp yahan = apati prakaash tivrata ; = pargamit prakaash kii tivrata tathaa madhyam kii tah kii motaai he
 Is called the absorption coefficient
 prakritik logerithm kaa aadhaar he
 Robert Buensen used the omission coefficient in place of
 lop gunank tah kii us motaai vyutkram he jisko paar karne par apati prakaash kii twrita prarambh main jitani thi uskaa dasavaan hissaa ho jaati he
 e = 0
4343 k can be easily proved
 bear kaa avasorana niyam bear ne 1852 i main lablert ke avasorana niyam kaa vistaar kiya
 He conducted an experimental study of the absorption of light through a solution and as a result of this study, formulated the "beer Absorption Rule"
 is niyam ko nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara vyakt karte hai : Ia = Ii exp xxrep 11 
 yaa Ia = I1 
 10 e xxrep 9 
 When the concentration c is in the granule, k is called the molecular absorption coefficient and e is called the 'granular omission coefficient'
 e gramanu vilyan kii tah kii us motaai ke baraabar he jiske dwaara Ii kaa maan Ii / 10 ho jaataa he
 The Beer Rule applies to dilute solutions; The absorption of light in a concentrated solution is of different value, not according to Beer's law
 jab koi photon kisi ek anu ke bahut hi sameep aa jaataa he, to photaan yaa to purna rup se avashoshit ho jaataa he yaa vah avashoshit hokar pun: ek duusari urja ke photaan ke rup main utsarjit hota he
 The photon that is completely absorbed is converted into the following types: 1
 ooshmaa avasoranakari tantra kaa taap bad jaataa he
 2
 The dissolution molecule disintegrates into its smaller components such as kakh ® + hn a + b
 3
 uttejitonu avasoranakari anu urja ko tab tak dhaaran kiye rahata he jab tak vah duusare anu se rasinic abhikriya nahin kar letaa, yaa vah urja kii duusare aise anu ko hastantarit kar detaa he jo uskaa upyog rasinic parivartan laane main karata he
 4
 Dissolution and Excitation a component of a light-dissolving compound remains in the excited state, such as kakh + hn --> k + kha* 5
 The ionizing molecule or atom moves out of the valence electron and a positive ion remains in place of the molecule or atom, such as kakh + hn --> k + kha + e 6
 Some fraction of the quanta absorbed by the fluorescence light-excited molecule, when the electron returns to the lower energy plane, is immediately emitted as another wavelength-radiation
 agar is prakaar ke utsarjan main kuch kshan kaa vilamb ho jaataa he to yah ghatana pratidipti na kahalaakar sfuradipti kehalaati he
 7
 Physical Interaction Here quanta have neither absorption nor re-emission, but rather some fraction of it is either taken up by the electron, as in the Compton effect, or the molecule rotates or the molecule affects the vibrational energy, as Raman effect is seen
 prayogon dwaara yah siddh kar diya gaya he ki har prakaar kii rasinic abhikriyaayein jaise vighatan, punarvinyas, yogashil, bahulikaran shrinkhalaa, prakaash utpreraky abhikriya prakaash dwaara ho sakati he
 Two rules have been proposed to explain photochemical reactions
 pehla niyam "graths draper niyam' ke naam se prasiddh he
 This rule is qualitative
 is niyam ke anusaar vahi prakaash padaartho main rasinic abhikriyaaon ko utpann karata he jo unase avashoshit hota he
 But this does not mean that it creates all the photochemical reactions which are absorbed by substances
 praaia: is avashoshit prakaash kaa roopantaran ooshmaa main ho jaataa he jisase padaartho kaa taap bad jaataa he
 The second law is known as "einstein's Photochemical Equivalence Rule"
 yah niyam prakaash rasinic prakriyaaon kii saidhantik vyakhya karne ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Einstein formulated this law using quantum theory
 is niyam ke anusaar avasoranakari padaarth prakaash ko quanta main avasorana karata he tathaa prakaash rasinic parivartan kii praathmik prakriya yah he ki ek avasoranakari anu prakaash ke ek hi kwantum hn kaa avasorana karata he
 The final result of a photochemical change is due to the increased chemical reactivity of the absorbing molecule, due to this reactivity it participates in secondary chemical reactions of the system
 antim fal praathmik tathaa gaun kriyaaon kaa sankalit fal hota he
 According to Einstein's law, in primary action, a grammar of a substance absorbs 6
02 x 10E23 quanta
 is "gramanu quanta' ko ek "oinstin' kehete hai
 If the "photon" of frequency n is absorbed by a grammar, the energy absorbed will be equal to E, Nh n, where n = number of molecules in a grammar = 6
02 x 10E23
 agar avashoshit photon kaa tarangadairghy l he to n = c / l, c prakaash ke veg kaa sanket he
 If l is in angstrum, then e = arg per gram
 suvidha ke liye urja ko calories main prakat karte hai
 One calorie is equal to 4
184 x 10E7 erg
 at: calories prati gramanu hua
 Putting the values of N, h, and c in the above equation e = kilo calories prati gramanu hota he
 This e is called Einstein which is obtained by radiation of length l
 upar likhit tathyon se yah spasht he ki l ke badhane se jo urja prati gramanu avashoshit hoti he vah adhik hoti he tathaa laal prakaash dwaara jo urja avashoshit hoti he vah ksheen hoti he
 The fruits of photochemical reactions are often expressed by the quantum potential of the process
 kwantum kshamta kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit he : prakaash avasorak gramanuon kii sankhya jo prakaash ke ek oinstin kaa avasorana karke rasinic abhikriya main bhaag leti he, us abhikriya kii kwantum kshamta kehalaati he
 We can also say that how many molecules participate in a reaction by absorbing one quantum of light
 oinstin ke niyam ke anusaar ek oinstin kaa avasorana karke ek gramanu prakriya main bhaag legaa
 Therefore, it is expected that for any photochemical reaction in which only light reacts, the quantum potential will be one
 prayogon dwaara gyaat kiya gaya he ki ini gini rasinic abhikriyaaon main kwantum kshamta ek yaa ek ke nikatatam hoti he
 In most reactions it will be either more or less than one
 saadhaarant: kwantum kshamta ek, do yaa teen bahut hi saamaanya he kintu kuch aisi bhi prakaash rasinic abhikriyaayein hai jinamein yah yaa to bahut hi adhik hoti he yaa, bahut hi kam
 The virtual difference between Einstein's law and experimental results is explained as follows
 ab yah maan liya gaya he ki oinstin kaa niyam keval praathmik kriya ke liye hi lagu hota he jisamen prakaash kaa vaastavik avasorana karata he kintu praaia: yah hota he ki praathmik kriya main jo padaarth paidaa hote hai ve pratikaarak ke anu ke saath baad kii tapiya kriyaaon main bhaag lete hai
 These thermal verbs are called secondary verbs
 duusare shabdon main yadhyapi praathmik kriya kii kwantum kshamta ek hoti he, tathaapi gaun kriyaaon ke kaaran jo antim fal praapt hota he uski kwantum kshamta ek hoti he, tathaa gaun kriyaaon ke kaaran jo antim fal praapt hota he uski kwantum kshamta ek se bhinn hoti he
 The actual value of the quantum potential of any photochemical reaction helps a great deal in understanding the nature and action of secondary functions
 udhaaharan ke liye hydrogen iodide ke prakaash rasinic vighatan kii kwantum kshamta do he
 Hence, the sequence of the entire reaction is as follows: HI + hn --> H ́ i HI + h -> H2 + i i + i --> I2 , And the sum of 2H i + hn -> H2 + i prakaash rasinic abhikriyaaon ke adhyayan kaa ek mukhya dhyey kisi bhi abhikriya kii kwantum kshamta ko prayog dwaara gyaat karnaa he
 For this, it is desirable to reveal the quantum potential with j =
 prakaash avasoranakari padaarth ke kitne gramanu kriya main prati second bhaag lete hai isko parichit rasinic vishleshan vidhiyon dwaara gyaat karte hai
 Since the value of Einstein depends on the light wavelength or frequency, or for the experimental study of photochemical reactions it is necessary to use monochromatic light
 ekvarni prakaash kaa arth he ek nishchit tarangadairghy kaa prakaash
 The very precise acceleration of monochromatic light is known by "thermal beam"
 tapiya punj dwaara prakaash ooshmaa main parivartan ho jaataa he or is ooshmaa dwaara jo vidyut vaahak bal utpann hota he usko vidyut dharamapi yantron dwaara gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 The electromotive force is measured both in the absence and presence of mechanisms
 in donon ke antar se kitne oinstin kaa avasorana hua gyaat ho jaataa he
 Many functions do not require the exact measurement of the thermal beam
 at: in sab kaaryon ke liye avashoshit prakaash urja ko kiran kriyamapi yaa prakaash-vidyut cell dwaara gyaat karte hai
 a ray spectrometer is a device by which how much radiation energy is absorbed in photochemical changes
 aajkal jitne prakaar ke kiran kriyamapiyon kaa prayog hota he unamem ek urenil oxelette kiran kriyamapi mukhya he
 It contains dilute solutions of uranyl sulfate and oxalic acid in a transparent container
 jab is kiran kriyamapi ko para bangnee yaa bangnee vikiran dwaara prakashit karte hai tab oxelic amla kaa vighatan ho jaataa he
 At the end of the experiment, the amount of oxalic acid dissolved is determined by titrating the remaining oxalic acid in the solution by potassium permanganate
 prayog aarambh karne ke pehle is kiran kriyamapi kaa prakaash ke vibhinn tarangadairdhyo par maanakeekaran kar liya jaataa he
 By knowing how much oxalic acid was dissolved, how much Einstein was absorbed
 tapiya punj kii prayog kii bhanti isamen bhi avashoshit oinstin kii maap kriyaatantr kii anupasthiti tathaa upasthiti main kii jaati he
 In this way, the energy equal to the difference between the two energy taken by the beam spectrometer was absorbed by the mechanism
 laton tathaa forbj ne prakaash rasinic abhikriya kaa adhyayan kiran kriya maapi dwaara atyant saavdhaanee tathaa yatharthata se kiya he
 Although the quantum potential varies slightly with wave length, it is assumed that by a mixed solution, in which concentrations of uranyl sulfate and oxalic acid are 0
01 gram molecule and 0
05 gram molecule per liter, respectively, 2540–4350 The absorption of quantum of light causes dissolution of 0
57 molecules of oxalic acid
 duusare shabdon main oxelic amla ke ek gramanu kaa vighatan 3,000 angstergam ke tarangadairghy ke 1
75 istan dwaara hoga
 Like thermal reactions, the speed of photosynthetic reactions depends on the concentration of the reactants, pressure, the nature of the solution and the concentration of the catalyst, etc
 tapiya abhikriyaaon kii apeksha ye abhikriyaayein taap se bahut hi kam prabhavit hoti hai
 Their heat coefficient is very poor
 prakaash rasayan ke antargat prakaash sugrahikarniya abhikriyaayein bhi aati hai
 In many activities, the light absorbing molecule does not itself participate in the action but only acts as an energy carrier
 iskaa ek sarvottam udhaaharan paarad vaashp ke parmaanu hai jo 2,537 angstrum parabangnee vikiran kaa avasorana karke sakriy avasthaa main aa jate he
 The energy of this radiation is 1,12,000 calories per gram
 hydrogen gas ke ek gramanu ko parmaanu main vighatit karne ke liye 1,02,400 calori kii aavashyaktaa hoti he; 2537 angstrum tarangadairghy kii urja isse adhik he
 But if the hydrogen gas is illuminated with 2537 angstrum obtained by cold permeable laps, its anuas will not break into atoms
 kintu yadi hydrogen anu kaa vighatan parmaanu main ho jaataa he
 The order of action is expressed by the following chemical equations: Hg + 2,537 angstrum = Hg* ; H2 + Hg* = hg+2h hydrogen gas 2,537 angstrum-vikiran ke liye paardarshee he
 The mercury vapor atom acts as a light-absorbing
 is prakaar praapt hydrogen parmaanu ati abhikriyasheel hote hai; ve dhatvik oxidon, nitras oxide, ethilin, carbon monooxide or duusare padaartho kaa shghrita tathaa sugamawa se apchayan kar dete hai
 Excited mercury atoms decompose not only hydrogen but also ammonia and other organic matter
 paarad parmaanu ke atirikt prakaash sugraahak ke anya bahut se udhaaharan hai jaise, chlorine, bromine, ozon tathaa urenil oxelette
 Photosensitive reactions occur in all states - solid, liquid and gas
 vibhinn prakaar kii prakaash rasinic abhikriyaayein prakaash kii kin tarangon dwaara hoti hai tathaa inaki kwantum kshamta kitni hoti he, inkaa adhyayan anek yogicon ke saath hua he
 The study of photochemistry has some important practical purposes
 kuch abhikriyaaon kii vyapaarik upyogita he
 These reactions mainly involve series and multiplication processes
 prakaash kii alp maatra se jin padaartho kaa sanshleshan hota he ve vyapaarik mahatv ke hote hai
 The devastating effects of radiation energy are also numerous, such as dyeing, rubber depletion, disintegration of some polymers
 udyog main in vinaashkari prabhaavon kaa niraakaran karnaa ati aavashyak he
 By photochemical methods, independent and active atoms can be readily produced as needed
