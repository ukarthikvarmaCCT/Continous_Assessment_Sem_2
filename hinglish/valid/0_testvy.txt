 Before the establishment of Darul Uloom in 1867, Imam Qasim Nanautvi had gained knowledge of Hadith from Shah Abdulgani Mujaddidi, his last Ilmi heir at Shah Waliullah Dahlavi's Islamic learning center in Delhi

 For example, commissioning of defense deals in India is illegal, hence it is considered a corruption and anti-national act and is called a scam

 To justify the equation of 'greater control - more corruption', the example of alcoholism in America in the thirties is also cited, which led to an unprecedented boom in organized and economic corruption

 lekin tej rakrataar se hone vaale udyogikaran or aabaadi kii awaazahi ke kaaran samaaj sthapit maanakon or mulyon ko chhodte chale jate hai
 As a result, a large scale corruption phenomenon arises
 sattar ke dashak main hidanhimer kii yah siddhant khaasaa prachlit tha
 Instead of advocating anti-corruption policies and programs, Heidenheimer concluded that as the prosperity in society increases, the prestige of the middle class will increase and urban civilization and way of life will develop, this problem automatically came under control Will go

 After this, comparative studies of corruption started through surveys and statistics
 lekin in prayaason ke parinaam kisi bhi tarah se santoshjanak nahin maane ja sakate
 In 2007, Daniel Treesman called 'what Have We Learned About the Causes of Corruption from Ten Years of Cross National Imperial Research?' The result has come from writing that mature liberal democracies and market-oriented societies are relatively less corrupt
 unke ulat tel niryaat karne vaale desh, adhik niyantrankari kanoon banane vaale or mudrasphiti ko kaabo main na karne vaale desh kahin adhik bhrasht hai
 Obviously these conclusions are not new from any angle
 haal hi main jin deshon main aarthik ghotaalon kaa pardaafaash hua he unamem chote-bade or viksit-aviksit yani har tarah ke desh hai
 Going beyond these conflicting views of corruption as convenient and harmful, it has not yet formulated any direct relationship with economic growth
 udaahranarth, asia ke do deshon, dakshin korea or philippines, main bhrashtachar ke suchakank bahut unche hai
 However, the rate of economic growth in Korea is significant, while in the Philippines it is low

 The Holocaust was a thought-provoking and planned attempt to eliminate the entire Jewish people from the root
 1933 main adolf hitler germany kii satta main aayaa or usne ek naslvaadi samrajya kii sthapana kii, jisamen yahudiyon ko sab-human qaraar diya gaya or unhen insaani nasl kaa hissaa nahin mana gaya
 In 1939, after Germany incited World War, Hitler began to implement his final solution to eradicate the Jews
 uske sainik yahudiyon ko kuch khaas ilaakon main thunsane lage
 Special camps were set up to get them working, to gather and kill them at one place, the most notorious being Auschwitz
 yahudiyon ko in shiviron main laayaa jaataa or vahaan band kamaron main jahrili gas chhodkar unhen maar daalaa jaataa
 Those who are not considered capable of working would be put to death, while most of the remaining Jews died of hunger and disease
 yuddh ke baad saamne aae dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki hitler kaa makasad duniya se ek-ek yahudee ko khatm kar dena tha
 During the six years of the war, the Nazis killed about six million Jews, including 1
5 million children
 yahudiyon ko jad se mitaane ke apane makasad ko hitler ne itane prabhavi dhang se anjaam diya ki duniya kii ek tihaai yahudee aabaadi khatm ho gai
 This massacre was unique in terms of number, management and execution
 iske tahat ek samudaay ke log jahaan bhi mili, ve maare jane lage, sirf isliye ki ve yahudee paidaa hue the
 Due to these reasons, it was named after its kind - Holocaust
 is sawaal ke kai jawaab pesh kiye jate rahe hai : dharmik, aitihaasik, darshanik, manovaigyanik or marxvaadi
 But no one answer can ever be satisfactory
 aitihaasik jawaab kuch is tarah he- 1930 ke dashak main german jansankhya ke ek bade hisse ne ek aise samaaj main rahane kii rajamandi jataai, jo nafrat, jaateey shreshthata kii avadharana or hinsa par aadhaarit thi
 The central belief of the system they were tied to was that the Jewish people represent everything that is against the Germans and therefore the Jews should be exterminated
 yah dharna duniya ko dekhne ke ek nasli nazariye se bhi judi thi, jo germanon ko master res kaa hissaa maanati thi or yahudiyon ko vinaashkari bhautik gunon vaale anti res kaa
 When the geographical elimination of the Jews could not be possible, then they took the most radical route, which was the final solution
 itihaas main is tarah kii or bhi ghatnaayen milti hai, lekin holocost kii kuch baaten use vilakshan banaati hai
 Apart from Nazi Germany, many governments have resorted to camp systems and technology, and Jews have been murdered for much of history
 lekin do mukhya vajahon se holocost ko sabase alag kaha ja saktaa he
 1
 Apart from their policies towards other groups, the Nazis undertook to kill every Jew
 iske liye unhone umr, ling, aasthaa yaa kaam kii parvaah nahin kii
 He especially used a modern bureaucracy to accomplish this objective

 However, there was no real threat from the Jews

 ke aas-paas hindi kavita main ek nayaa mode aayaa
 This was particularly stimulated by the immediate court culture and Sanskrit literature
 sanskrit sahityashastra ke katipay anshon ne use shastreey anushaasan kii ore pravrutt kiya
 In Hindi, the word 'riti' or 'poetry' was used for poetry
 isliye kavyashastrabaddh saamaanya srujanpravriti or ras, alankaar aadi ke nirupak bahusankhyak lakshangranthon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is samay ke kavy ko 'reetikavy' kaha gaya
 The clearest signs of the old tradition of the poetic nature of this poetry are found in the adhikavya of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhransh, Persian and Hindi, and the sringari tendencies of Krishnakavya
 is kaal main kai kavi aise hue hai jo acharya bhi the or jinhone vividh kavyangon ke lakshan dene vaale granth bhi likhe
 Shringar dominated in this era
 yah yug muktak-rachana kaa yug rahaa
 Mainly Kavitta, Savaiya and Doha were written in this era

 Most of the poets of Reetikal were courtiers
 keshavadas, pratap singh, bihari, matiram, bhushan, chintamani, dev, bhikharidas, raghunatha, benny, gang, tikaaram, gwaal, chandrasekhar bajpei, harnaam, kulapati mishra, nevaaj, surati mishra, kavindra udaynath, rishinath, ratan kavi, benny bandijan, benny praveen, brahmadatt, thakur bundelkhandi, bodha, gumaan mishra aadi or anek kavi to raja hi the, jaise- maharaj jaswant singh, bhagawant raay khichi, bhupati, rasanidhi, maharaj vishwanath, dwijadev 
 Ritikavya's work was started by a Sanskritist
 ye the acharya keshavadas, jinaki sarvaprasiddh rachanaayen kavipriya, rasikapriya or ramchandrika hai
 In Kavipriya, the ornamentation and rasikapriya have the illustrative representation of rasa
 lakshan dohon main or udhaaharan kavittasavaie main hai
 This tradition of symptoms-goal-texts developed in Ritikavya
 ramchandrika keshav kaa prabandhkavy he jisamen bhakthi kii tanmayata ke sthaan par ek sajag kalakaar kii prakhar kalachetana prasphutit hui
 Several decades after Keshava, from the Chintamani to the eighteenth century, the Ajastra source of ritualism flowed in Hindi, with a very artistic expression of the delightful aspects of male-female-life and the Saras sensitivities of it
 reetikaal ke kavi raajaaon or raison ke aashray main rahete the
 There was a natural atmosphere of entertainment and artistry

 Literature written in such an environment was mostly erotic and artistic
 par isi samay prem ke svachhand gayak bhi hue jinhone prem kii gaharaaiyon kaa sparsh kiya he
 Both in terms of quantity and poetry, this period's poetic euphemism of male-female love and beauty is important
 is samay virakavy bhi likhaa gaya
 The disturbance of the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb's clash with staunch communalism and aggressive politics led to the creation of Virakavya by some poets during this period
 aise kaviyon main bhushan pramukh hai jinhone reetistylee ko apanaate hue bhi veeron ke parakram kaa ojasvi varnan kiya
 At this time poetry related to policy, quietness and devotion was also written

 In this research work, non-modern compositions and anthropologies of this time are being found in abundance
 isliye reetikalin kavy ko nitant ekangi or ekarup samajhnaa uchit nahin he
 All the tendencies of the earlier periods are active in poetry of this time
 yah pradhan dhara shringaarakavy kii he jo is samay kii kavyasampatti kaa vaastavik nidarshak maani jaati rahi he
 Shringari poetry is divided into three sections
 pehla varg reetibaddh kaviyon kaa he jiske pratinidhi keshav, chintamani, bhikharidas, dev, matiram or padmakar aadi hai
 These poets have given artistic signs of love and beauty to the poetess by giving signs of rasa, ornamentation and heroine in couplets
 sanskrit sahityashastra main nirupit shastreey charchaa kaa anusaran maatr inamen adhik he
 But some have also shown some originality, such as Bhikharidas's representation of Hindi verses
 doosraa varg ritisiddh kaviyon kaa he
 These poets did not depict the symptoms, only based their poetry on them
 bihari inamen sarvshereshth hai, jinhone dohon main apni "satsai' prastut kii
 Extremely expressive aesthetics with different postures and unique expressions of love are found in his poetry
 tisare varg main ghanaanand, bodha, dwijadev thakur aadi reetimukt kavi aate hai jinhone svachhand prem kii abhivyakti kii he
 His compositions have a very impressive euphemism of intensity and intensity of love
 reetikavy mukhyat: maansal shringaar kaa kavy he
 It has a beautiful opening to the delightful sides of male and female life
 adhik kavy muktak style main he, par prabandhkavy bhi hai
 In these two hundred years, Shringarakavya had an extraordinary rise
 par dhire dhire reeti kii jakad badhati gai or hindi kavy kaa bhavakshetra sankeern hota gaya
 By coming to the modern era, the attention of writers was particularly attracted to these two shortcomings
