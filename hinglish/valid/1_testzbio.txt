 a creative work can be called a process ie a theoretical part called accounting

 swatantra vyakti- ankekshan kaary kisi aise vyakti dwaara hona chahie jiskaa vyapaar athwa sanstha se kisi bhi prakaar kaa sambandh na ho
 Only then a fair investigation is possible
 at: vartmaan main chartered lekhapal kii niyukti kii gai hai
 Form of the investigation- The test conducted by the audit does not only reveal the accuracy related to mathematics, but it is an intelligent unbiased test which shows the absolute accuracy of the calculation
 lekha pustaken- ankekshan main lekha-pustakon kii jaanch hoti he
 The auditor does not have to restrict his field of work to only books, but also has to know other statutory books and various facts
 pramank evam prapatr- lekha pustakon kii jaanch pramankon evam prapatron ke aadhaar par kii jaati he, yadi yah uplabdh na hon to inaki pratilipiyon se pushti kii jaati hai
 Information and Explanation - The basis of the inquiry is the evidence itself, but if the auditor is not satisfied with the memorization certificate, then for verification of the transactions one can ask for information and clarification
 budhimattapurna- ankekshan dwaara kii jane vaali jaanch kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn he at: is kaary main buddhi evam chaturaai kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo is kaary ke anubhav se praapt hoti he
 Purpose of checking- The purpose of checking the books of accounts is to verify the results of the profit and loss account created in a certain period and the assets and obligations shown in the letter on a certain date and give a certificate on satisfaction
 vastav main ankekshak ko antim khaaton kii jaanch par apni raay prakat kerani hoti he
 Regularity - Under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, some important rules should be kept in mind while creating the company's letter and profit and loss account
 at: company ankekshak ko apni report main likhnaa hota he ki chittha niyamaanukool he athwa nahin
 Period- Auditing is generally done for accounts of one financial year or one accounting year
 yadi ek se adhik varsh ke lekhon kaa ankekshan kiya jaataa he to yah jaanch anusandhan kehalaati he
 Result- After checking the articles, a report has to be given regarding its veracity and appropriateness
 yadi ankekshak kisi baat se asantusht he to iskaa varnan spasht rup se apni report main karata he
 As an accounting imperative, accounting in practical terms is essential to keep the business alive and to gain prestige in the society
 iske liye nimnlikhit tark diye ja sakate hai : In today's era, accurate knowledge of profit or loss from a business is not a concept without accounting
 vyavsaayee kii aarthik sthiti suddadh va aarthik saadhan bahut achche hon, to bhi anya vyavsaayee ke mukaable sasti bechney ke falswaroop bikri adhik ho lekin sirf diwaala nikalne par hi use pataa chalegaa ki usne vastu ko laagat se bhi kam main bech diya he
 There are more transactions in the business, especially where the goods are sold more on credit, it is not possible to remember the names of the debtors, so accounting is mandatory
 ek nishchit avadhi kii samaapti par laabh hua athwa haani
 Accounting is mandatory for this
 vyavsaayik lekha-pustaken yadi sucharu tareeke se rakhi jaayen to chaluvarsh kii aay-vyay yaa laabh-haani kii tulana pichley varshon ke laabh-haani se kii ja sakati he
 Through accounting, the trader gets to know his financial position
 kar-nirdhaaran main lekhon kaa bahut mahatv he
 If the accounts are kept according to the rules then these are very helpful
 ek vyapaaree ko kin-kin vyaktiyon ko kul kitna rupaya dena he, yah soochna lekhankan se hi mil sakati he
 More profit can be made by starting unprofitable actions except for non-profitable actions and if there is a deficiency in efficiency then they can be overcome by knowing their reasons
 yah kaary lekhakarm dwaara hi sambhav he
 If proper books of accounts are kept in a business, then the reputation of that business increases
 lekhankan ke nimnlikhit laabh bhi hai : ACCOUNTING LUXURY AS chote vyapaariyon ke liye ise vilasita mana gaya he kyonki inaki simit aavashyaktaaen hoti hai kintu vartmaan samay main yah purna rup se uchit prathit nahin hoti he
 Auditing as Luxury lagaana he phir bhi hisaab-kitaab main chal-kapat chhipe rah jate he, jo ankekshak uchit chaturaai va saavdhaanee ke baavjood nahin pakad saktaa hai
 Hence the audit is meaningless
 uparokt tathyon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai ki chote-chote vyapaar main ankekshan vilasita he lekin sabhi vyavsaayon ke liye ankekshan ko vilasita kahana galat hoga
 Small organizations where there are one or two employees and the owner of accounting is looked after by a sole trader or partner, so auditing is not necessary, but in big business it is profitable and highly necessary, not luxury
 ankekshan kaa vilasita na hona Enhancing the efficiency of the employees - The efficiency of the employee increases as a result of the audit, because they know that an error can be detected by the auditor if the work is not done properly! karmchaariyon kii kaarykushalta main vruddhi-kushal ankekshan ke falswaroop karmchaariyon apane-apane kaary main daksh ho jate hai kyonki ankekshak samay-samay par apni report main tathaa ankekshan ke dauraan bhi kamiyon ko bataata rahata he va maargdarshan bhi karata rahata he
 Increase in efficiency of managers- When the managers know that the auditor will submit their report on the work done by them, which will be acceptable, they will do their work with full sincerity
 vyavsaay ke vikaas main sahaayak- ankekshit hisaab-kitaab par sabhi vishwaas karte hai tathaa isse vyapaar kii khyaati main vruddhi hoti he tathaa sabhi ore se vyavsaay ko suvidhaayen praapt hoti hai jisase vyavsaay kaa vikaas hota hai
 Decision in case of insolvency possible- If the books of accounts are properly conducted and audited, then the court can help in getting the debt relief order
 ho saktaa he iske abhaav main samay adhik lag jaay
 Assistants in future planning - The managers conduct comparative studies on the basis of the final accounts of several years and see how the efficiency can be increased
 plant evam mashin kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- laagat lekhon ke ankekshan se yah maaloom hota he ki mashiinon kii kitni kaaryakshmata he tathaa kin-kin kaarnon se mashiinon kii purna kaaryakshmata kaa prayog nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Efficiency can be increased by acquiring information about these reasons
 ankekshan kii anivaaryta Auditing affects efficiency, so it cannot be called luxury
 nimnakint dashaon main yah anivaary hai – Thus it would not be completely true to say that accounting is mandatory and auditing is a luxury
 chote vyapaar main kahin-kahin lekhankan bhi vilasita he jabaki bade vyavsaayon ke liye anivaary hi he
 But still accounting and auditing are two sides of a coin
 yadi lekhankan na ho to ankekshan kiskaa hoga
 And if accounting is alone then it does not have the credibility of its veracity
 truti karnaa maanav swabhaav kaa ek bhaag hai ankekshan kaa pramukh uddeshy bhi ashuddhi va gaban kaa pataa lagaana va unhen rokna hota hai
 Checking of preliminary articles, journal checking, checking of cash balances, checking of balances of accounts, checking of account books of subsidiary books, matching of previous year's floor, finding the amount of difference, to check the auditor's errors Can take action etc
 yadi ankekshak apane kaary main itani saavdhaanee, kushalta evam budhimaani kaa prayog kare jitna ki un paristhitiyon main sammav tha or usne purna praytn kiya ho jo ki trutiyon ko dhund nikaalane hetu param aavashyak tha
 If still unable to detect fraud, the auditor cannot be held liable
 ankekshan kaary kaa arth yah kabhi nahin hota 'ki ankekshak ne ashuddhiyon evam gaban kaa beemaa kar liya he, na hi vah is baat kii garanti detaa he ki samast ashuddhiyon evam gaban ko dhund nikaalega
 He is only expected to do his work with due care and cleverness
 AAS-1 main un aadharbhoot siddhanton ke vishay main bataaya gaya he jo ankekshak ke peshewar dayitvon se sambandhit hai tathaa jinka paalan ankekshan karte samay anivaary he

 This review and evaluation show whether: ankekshan prativedan main vittiya soochnaaon par raay kii spashtatah likhit abhivyakti kaa samavesh hona chahie
 The AAS-2 "objective and Scope of the Audit of Financial Statements" states that the field of the auditor is determined keeping in view the appointment conditions, prevailing statutes, etc
 of the auditor
 vittiya vivaranon par raay kaayam karne ke liye vibhinn tareekon kaa upyog karte hue lekhankan abhilekhon va anya soochnaaon kii vishwasaneeyata tathaa paryaaptta kii jaanch kar leni chaiye
 To this end, the auditor follows such procedures to assure that the financial statements give a true and fair picture of the financial position and operating results of an enterprise
 ' The auditor, with his professional experience and decision-making ability, sets certain criteria for investigation, while doing so he cannot be expected to work outside his area of competence
 ankekshak apane kaary ko seemaa nirdhaarit kar hi kaary prarambh karata he
 There are two such limits: - Extensive limit, Intensive limit
 vistrut seemaa main ankekshak yah tay karata he ki kitne vyavhaaron ke lekhon kaa ankekshan karnaa he, jabaki gahan seemaa main yah tay karata he ki kin vyavhaaron ko gahanta se jaanchega va kitni gaharaai se jaanch kerani he

 nishpaadan ankekshan The methods of audit are such that it suffers from various inherent limitations
 at: ek ankekshak ko in arntanihit simaaon ko samajhnaa mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki uski is samaj se hi ankekshan ke sarvangin uddeshyon ke prati spashtataa praapt ho sakegi
 Limitations are as follows: - siddhanth kaa arth ek sarabhoot tathy, ek aadharbhoot niyam se he
 The principles of audit are such important truths that provide knowledge of the objectives of audit and explain the ways in which these can be met
 ankekshan va aashwaasan mandand jari kar chartered accoutents santhaan ne is or pahal prarambh kii he
 In the audit process, all those tasks are done which are adopted during any investigation under the audit principles

 The audit methodology includes measures that are collected as evidence required for audit and adopted to check the accuracy of the behaviors written in the accounting books

 pratapgarh ke riyasat banane ke baad 1578 tak baravarda or basaad ko chhod kar sabhi 548 chote bade gaanvon par pratapgarh kaa aadhipaty ho gaya 1586 me 17 akraman ke baad baravarda va 1603 me 43 se zyada akraman ke baad kar sambandhi sandhi va sena me alag tukdi kii baat ke saath basaad bhi pratapgarh me shaamil ho gaya jiske baad basaag ko alag pargana banaaya gaya It is also found in the documents of history that during the reign of Gopal Singh, Marathas started raising heads everywhere and they used to carry out organized attacks on the princely states on the basis of muscle power, but Gopal Singh due to his good relations with Mewar Not only did the Maharana of Udaipur obtain the rule of the Dhariyavad pargana, but he was able to protect his kingdom much from the plunder of the Marathas
 mogul or british kaal main pratapgarh rajya 'bahari' hastkshepon se bahut kuch achoota rahaa, kuch isliye bhi ki na keval yahan ke tatkaaleen raajaaon ne dilli ke shaskaon ko 15,000 rupee kii salanaa 'khiraj' dene kaa nishchay kiya, balki saalim singh ne mogul-shaasha shah alam dwitiya se apane rajya ke liye nae 'salimshahi sikke' prachlit karne kii likhit sweekruti kaa navinikaran karavaaya, jo 'paratabgarh' kii sthaneey-taksaal main main hi dhaale jane vaale the
 In 1761, Malharrao Holkar's commander Tukoji Rao laid siege to Pratapgarh, but failed to recover any money from here
 Yes, two years later, in 1763, Malharrao Holkar made a recovery from Salim Singh while going to Udaipur
 Then the Marathas were very strong on all sides
 saalim singh, jinhone pratapgarh ke paas 'salamgarh' basaaya tha, ke putr samant singh ke raajkaal main maraathon ne to pratapgarh par hamalaa or lutpaat na karne kii evaj main 72,720 / - salimshahi rupayon kii salanaa 'khiraj' tak bandhawa lee
 maraathon ke aatank se ajiz aa kar samant singh ne 1804 main angrejon se sandhi kii or jo vasuuli maratha kiya karte the, vahi raashi angrejon ko die jane kaa qaraar kiya gaya; par lord cornwalis kii nayi rajya-nitiyon ke chalate ye qaraar bhi bahut samay tak lagu na rah sakaa or pratapgarh antat angarez hukumat ke sidhe niyantran main aa gaya
 In 1818, once again a 12-point treaty was signed with the British Government of Pratapgarh, according to which the British were refused to give Rs 35,000 in the first year and Rs 72,700 / - in the fifth year to the British
 unka smarak pratapgarh main is link par dekha ja saktaa he- Samant Singh handed over the rule of Pratapgarh to his son Deep Singh, who did a good job for some time, but some of the opponents of his state found Deep Singh's rule at the local level to be extremely unsatisfactory and the incidents of rebellion against the regime intensified
 So, due to the crush of the rebels who raised the head, Deep Singh even got some killed
 This action of Deep Singh went to the English masters, and he ordered Deep Singh to go to Devgarh and stay there
 For some time, Deep Singh was almost under house arrest in Devgarh, but he returned to Pratapgarh shortly after, avoiding the rule of the British Raj
 angrezi raaj ko ye hukumauduli sahan na hui, lihaaza angarez fouj kii ek tukdi ne aamane-saamne kii ek ladaai main deepasingh ko haraa kar bandi bana liya or gwalior rajantargat achera-gadhi main bhej diya, jahaan 1826 main ek kaidi ke rup main is raja ne antim saans lee

 Contrary to this source, Pandit Sundar Lal, the celebrated author of "english Raj in India" remembers Deep Singh as a patriot fighter Kunwar Deep Singh revolutionary in these words - " bharatvarsh main sabase pehle bengal main hi aazaadee kaa bigul baja
 Some revolutionaries of the 'anand Math' gang came to South Rajputana or malwa-anchal
 devliya pratapgarh kaa kunwar deepasingh bengali krantikariyon ke sampark main aayaa
 On the other hand, he was related to the Holkar court because his princely state sent the Mughals to Khiraz by Holkar
 us samay jaswantrao holkar mahapratapi rajkumaar tha or uske man main bhi angrejon ke virudgh vidroh ke jowar laharaa rahe the kyonki angrej maraathon ko aapas main ladaate the or is prakaar unhone maharashtra mandal ko nasht kar diya tha
 Dip Singh and Jaswant Rao Holkar prepared for the revolution and their first task was not to allow these treaties, which were to sit at the banks of the Chambal, contact Lord Lake and other British kings of the princely states of Malwa and Rajputana
 yah kunwar deepasingh kaa hi praytn tha ki angrej san 1800 main pratapgarh riyasat se sandhipatr likhavane main asafal rahe
 Re-enacted in 1802
 bengal se jo krantikari, riyasat devliya pratapgarh aae the, unamem ramakrishna das naamak nimbark-sampradaay kaa ek bees varshiya noujvaan bhi tha
 He was so impressed by his talent, scholarship and, more than that, his excellent nationality that the family made Ramakrishna Das, the Mahant of his biggest private temple 'sri Raghunath Dwar' in Devalia
 isse kunwar deepasingh kii yah chaal safal hui ki vah ek atithi sharnaagat krantikari ko uske pad, maryaada ke anuroop surakshit rakhane main safal ho gaya
 The British spies reached Devalia, clutching the scattered people of the gang of Anand Math and the agitators of Jaswant Rao Holkar
 unke sanket par bengal paidal sena kii ek tukdi ramakrishna das or kunwar deepasingh ko giraftaar karne ke liye devliya se lagbhag gyaarah mile dur malwa kii disha main aa dati
 But Deep Singh got smarter and his soldiers killed the Bengal infantry captain John Boyley and others
 is par angrej bahut bigade
 But as long as the princely state remained in the hands of Kunwar Deep Singh as Prime Minister, the British could not interfere
 keval unke guptcharon ke jariye samachar jate rahe
 a few years later, the heinous task of killing Kunwar Deep Singh by poisoning him with watermelon was the same of the necessary detectives of the British, who in those days got the thank-you letters of the British
 un dinon bishap haibar naam kaa ek bada padri bharat kii yatra par aayaa tha
 He also traveled to Malwa and Devalia Pratapgarh
 usne apane yatra varnanon main kunwar deepasingh kaa kaaphi ullekh kiya he
 It is an undisputed truth that if Jaswantrao Holkar, Kunwar Deep Singh and the companions of Bengal would have got the support of other rulers and people of the country, the revolution of 1857 would have been at least forty-fifty years ago and would have succeeded because those forty In the last five years, the British did not get the opportunity to break into Indian social, national and economic life

 When Uday Singh became Gaddinshin in 1865, Pratapgad's day really changed a lot
 Uday Singh made many reforms in governance, established civil courts, waived some taxes, opened government shops of fair value and started many relief operations for the subjects during the notorious famine 'chhappaniya period' of 1876-1878
 Uday Singh also built a separate palace for himself in Pratapgarh on some British lines and focused seriously on administrative reforms in the state
 1867 main yahaan pehali ayurvedic dispenceri kholi gayi or muft adivasee shiksharth 1875 main state primary skool samet kuch paathshaalaayein

 Apart from two experienced princes, sadar-munsarim, Patwari, settabast-amin were appointed in the new department of settlement

 The Department of Posts and Telegraphs came into existence in 1884 with the grace of the British
 1890 main udai singh kaa dehanth hua, par chunki unka swayan kaa koi putr na tha, unki vidhwaa rani ne apane pati ke chachere bhai raghunatha singh ko god le liya, jinhen 1891 main angrezi shashan ne divangat udaisingh kaa uttaradhikari sweekaar kar liya
 In the same year, in 1893-94, 'sadar Hospital' was established, apart from the octroi, some post offices were also opened and the most useful construction work - a paved road through village Rajpuria, from Pratapgarh to Mandsaur, which was built by rail from the residents of Pratapgarh
 Also had its first contact route
 1894 isvi main 'mahakama khaas' kaa gathan hua
 The major written 'duties' prescribed by this department were - recovery of land revenue, judgment of civil and criminal cases, maintenance of revenue records of the state, viewing of all its work in the absence of 'settlement-princes', Public hearing, tour and inspection and appointment of lumberdars and patwaris in villages, etc
 Then under this department there used to be a post like Tehsildar named hakim-mal, under which many posts like naib-tehsildar, Sadar Kanungo, Patwari, Mafidar, Ahlmad, Ahlkar, zam-khat-navis, naib-ahlkar

 The royal-mint was discontinued in 1904 during Raghunath Singh's tenure, as the English-currency was accepted as the 'state-currency' in Pratapgarh state instead of the 'salimshahi' coin
 raghunatha singh ke shashan main hi 1912 main 'district-police-captain' kaa nayaa pad banaaya gaya
 The State Police Department was reconstituted and land management was also implemented in 'khalsa villages'

 The annual income of the state of 'paratabgarh' was about 6 lakhs in 1907

 In 1936, a separate 'zenana Hospital' with 15 separate patient-beds was created, Gram Panchayats were formed in 1938 and a few elected members also came in addition to the nominated members in the municipality, Pratapgarh
 The most notable thing was the establishment of the High Court in Pratapgarh in 1938

 pratap singh maharavat ne san 1699 main jis gaanv ke aage ja kar pratapgarh kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha, us gaanv kaa naam tha-doderia kaa kheda jo aaj bhi vidyaman he

 It was then known as "kanthal-raj"
 'kanthal' kaa shabdic maayna he- 'kanth-pradesh' yaa kinare kaa bhubhag! Salim Singh had also built a park around the city to protect his city, with two small gates - 'talab Bari' and 'qila Bari' and four large entrances 'surajpol', 'bhatpura Bari', 'devaliya Darwaza' And 'dhamottar Darwaza'
 suraj doobane ke saath hi ye sab ke sab nagar-dwaar band kar die jate the, baahar se aane waalon ko suryoday tak shahar ke baahar hi raat bitaani padati thi
 Where is that old 'pratabgarh' now? The speed of time-cycle has obliterated Parkota, the old gateways and stepwells of the old Shalosurta, and the old splendor of the days of the monarchy has been destroyed

 After the announcement made by the then Chief Minister of Rajasthan Smt Vasundhara Raje Scindia in the Vidhan Sabha budget session on Republic Day 2008, it again got the opportunity to become an independent district

 Natural Sushma's rich Pratapgad district is joined by Banswara, Chittaurgarh, Neemuch, Ratlam and Mandsaur districts, so it is not accidental that the tribal culture and tradition is not only here on Rajasthan, but also the language, costumes, dialects and culture of Madhya Pradesh
 There is also an imprint
 madhya pradesh se pratapgarh kii sarahadein lambaai main kareeb 60 pratishat hisse se milti hai or bhugolic duriyon ke kam hone ke kaaran aaj bhi rajasthan ke sudur jilon main bete-betiyon kaa byaah karne kii bajaay rishte-naatedari ke liye log padausi-rajya madhya pradesh kii taraf hi dekhte hai! Although people of all religions, faiths, beliefs and castes reside in Sadapgarh in good faith, the main component of the population here - about 60 per cent, are the Meena Adivasis, who are classified as 'scheduled Tribes' in the state
 pipal khoont upkhand main to 80 fisadi se zyada aabaadi meena janajati kii hi he
 These Meena families for living are basically dependent on agriculture, wages, animal husbandry and forest produce, having their own distinct culture, dialect and costumes
 anya jatiyaan gujars, bhil, balaai, bhaanti, dholi, rajput, brahman, mahajan, sunar, luhaar, chamaar, nai, taili, tamboli, lakhera, rangarej, rabari, gavaaria, dhobi, kumhaar, dhaca, kulmi, anjana, patidaar or dangi aadi hai
 sikh-sardar does not even appear by searching on this side inke reeti-rivaaz, loakgeet, lokanrity, waar-tyohaar or shaadi-byaah ke taur-tareeke bhi alabele hai, par tezi se bad rahe shaharikaran ke prabhaav adivasee paramparon par bhi bahut mukhar hai
 For example, a bandbaja is now being called on the wedding festivities in the village and the guests' food is entrusted to the 'caterer'-halwais! In many places, film music has been incorporated into traditional folk dances performed on Manglik occasions
 kai gaanvon main saje-dhaje thelon vaali local bend-partiyaan bani hui hai
 There is a peculiar tradition here - Mautana: which is prevalent in the entire Udaipur division, especially in tribal dominated districts - Pratapgarh, Dungarpur and Banswara
 In the event of an accident or death in unnatural circumstances, the entire tribal population encircles the 'convict' or criminal until they make cash compensation and indigenous liquor for the entire community
 In this process, bargaining or 'bargaining' from both sides is common
 kai baar to 'mautana' kii rakam tay hone tak shav kaa antim sanskaar tak nahin kiya jaataa, bhale isamen kai kai ghante lag jaaen yaa kai din! jurmaane kii rakam kuch sau se kuch lakh tak bhi ho sakati he
 Many times this local police administration has to make law and order due to this ritual

 shahar main madirapremiyon ke liye kuch ek licenseshuda maikhane hai
 The closing time of government liquor shops is at 8 pm
 sharaab banane ke liye mahua ke phool binane vaale naasamajh adivasee kai baar pedo ke neeche jo aag laga dete hai, vah kai baar dawanal kaa rup le leti he
 The Mahua tree is preserved here because it is the only source of their 'medicine'! shaadi ke maukey par koi bhi adivasee steel kii thali or gilaas kanyadan main bhent main dena nahin bhuulataa
 After every marriage, steel bags and glass / lotus are deposited in a large number of girls
 jati-birdari kaa sahabhoj 'mosar' har shaadi main yojit hota he
 The second, even the third marriage, while the first wife is alive, is not considered socially bad in tribal society, so polygamous marriages are popular enough

 The ritual of bathing and washing daily in women is surprisingly low, just, women of rural areas bathe only on special occasions
 yahaan kii ek anya moorkhtapurna janajaatiy parampara 'vanadevi' pujan' he- jin dampatiyon ke santan nahin hoti, ve nissantan, choti-moti puja ke baad akele jangal main ja kar jangal ke ek ped ko gupachup aag laga dete hai or yah maanate hai ki is 'agni' se vanadevi prasann ho kar unki god bhar dengi, par 'sitamata' main is andhvishwaas ke chalate bade paimaane par vriksh kaal-kavlit hote rahe hai

 For stone masonry, there are two rows of standing bats: one adjacent to the wall and the other at a distance of five feet from it
 anya petiyaan donon siron par aadi ke upar rakhi rahati hai
 In this way these scaffolds are completely untouched by the wall, because it is not possible to leave holes at regular intervals in stone masonry
 jaise-jaise kaam aage badhata he, chaaliyaan bhi unchi uthaai jaati rahati hai
 For this, if necessary, the bats are lengthened by adding extra pieces

 Also, the boards used for the working platform are solitary or sole boards that are placed under the scaffold when the surface is soft or otherwise suspected, although ordinary boards can also be used, another called scaffpad
 The design is used as another solution, it is made of rubber base with a base plate mold inside, it is very effective on uneven ground Are, because they seem to cost more money to replace the sole boards adopt any size surface
 caplers fittings jo naliyon ko ek saath pakad kar rakhte hai
 The most common of these are called scaffolding couplers, they are basically of three types: right-angle couplers, putlog couplers and swivel couplers
 Joint pins or sleeve couplers from one end to the other end or both together are used to connect the tubes
