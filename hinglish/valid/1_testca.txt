 purv air force chif espi tyaagi ne gudgaanv main karodon rupee kii sampatti kharidi lekin uskaa byoraa centre sarkaar ko nahin diya
 The CBI has revealed this
 jaanch agency ke mutabik niyamanusaar sarkari karmchaaree ko sarkaar ko apni property ke bare main jaankaree deni hoti he
 Tyagi bought the property in Gurgaon while being the Chief of the Air Force but did not give details of it to the government
 air force kanoon ke tahat yah jurm he
 Tyagi could be punished in this case
 sibiai kii maane to jab agusta deal final ho rahi thi tab tyaagi kai bichauliyon se bhi mili
 The CBI favors that "if they knew they were middlemen, why didn't they tell the Central Government?" There were several attempts to talk to SP Tyagi about this matter but there was no response from his side
 tippaniyan Tyagi's lawyers, on the other hand, have said that the decision to buy the VVIP chopper was a "collective" decision, which was also part of the Prime Minister's Office
 sibiai apni taraf se safai de rahi he ki tyaagi or shesh aropiyon kii agar bel ho gai he to isse cese par koi fark nahin padegaa
 The CBI states that "we have no objection to the bail unless they mislead any witnesses and then tamper with the evidence
" " The court has not commented on the cbi's investigation
 vaise bhi sibiai ne hai court main tyaagi kii bel ke khilaaf arji laga di he
 According to the investigating agency, according to the rules, the government employee has to give information about his property to the government
 tyaagi ne vayusena pramukh rahete hue gudgaanv main sampatti kharidi lekin uskaa byoraa sarkaar ko nahin diya
 This is a crime under the Air Force Act
 is maamle main tyaagi ko sajaa ho sakati he
 According to the CBI, Tyagi also met with several middlemen when the Agusta deal was being finalized
 sibiai kaa paksh he ki "agar ve jaanate the ki ve bichauliye hai to centre sarkaar ko unhone bataaya kyon nahin ?" is maamle ko lekar espi tyaagi se baat karne kii koshish kai baar kii gai lekin unki taraf se koi jawaab nahin mila
 The comments udhar tyaagi ke vakil kah chuke hai ki viviipi helicopter kharidne kaa faisla ek "colective" faisla tha jiskaa hissaa pradhanmantri karyaalay bhi tha
 The CBI is clarifying on its behalf that if Tyagi and the remaining accused have been tried then it will not make any difference to the case
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki "jab tak ve kisi gavaah ko gumraah nahin karte ta phir saboot se chhedchhad nahin karte tab tak bel die jane par hamen koi aapatti nahin he
 " court ne sibiai kii jaanch par koi tippanee nahin kii he
 Anyway, CBI has filed an application against Tyagi's bail in the High Court
 sibiai kii maane to jab agusta deal final ho rahi thi tab tyaagi kai bichauliyon se bhi mili
 The CBI favors that "if they knew they were middlemen, why didn't they tell the Central Government?" There were several attempts to talk to SP Tyagi about this matter but there was no response from his side

 At the same time, 4-year-old Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also raised millions of supporters on social media in the last few months
 lakhon kii taadaad main achaanak aam aadmi party se jude soshal media samarthakon kii hakeekat kya he? yah samarthak kahin phek to nahin hai? yaa phir mahaj prasiddhi ke liye yah aam aadmi party kii koi nai ranneeti to nahin he? in tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab khangale kii koshish kii aaj tak samvaadadaata ashutosh mishra ne
 Twitter: As of March 2017 on the Aam Aadmi Party's Twitter page more than 4 years old

 2 million
 party ke sibar sena ke sadsy bataate hai Facebook par party kii pahunch pichley 5 maheenon main 50% tak zyada or sakriy tareeke se bad gai he
 Now the question is, how did the Aam Aadmi Party get so many supporters in these four five months? Are fake accounts used to garner support? To find answers to these questions, we compared the messages posted on the Aam Aadmi Party's Facebook page and Twitter account
 punjab vidhansabha chunaav or dilli ke nagar nigam chunaav tak aam aadmi party unke tamaam netaa party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal lagaataar bijepi or centre sarkaar ke khilaaf jamkar lagbhag har roj hamale bolte rahe
 On the next day, the entire leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party continued to attack Prime Minister Modi and the BJP on new issues
 lagbhag 1 saal se zyada chali is puri shrinkhalaa ko ek vakt ke baad nakaaratmak pratikriya milane lageen
 According to Aam Aadmi Party sources, after the Delhi Municipal Corporation lost the party, the party churned and decided to make a drastic change in its strategy
 is badali ranneeti kaa asar aam aadmi party ke netaaon main pichley chaar paanch maheenon main dikhne laga chaahe vah media main die gaye unke bayaan ho yaa phir soshal media main unki pratikriyaayein
 After continuously losing the election, a new strategy led the Aam Aadmi Party to start talks on positive issues of Aam Aadmi Party's government and party policies, leaving negative publicity against BJP and PM Modi on social media
 aam aadmi party ke soshal media ke sadasyon or netaaon ko bhi dilli sarkaar ke faislon ko janata ke bich le jane ke nirdesh die gaye
 From Facebook to Twitter, a strategy has been chalked out to spread every step and every decision taken by the Delhi government in the field of health and education
 itnaa hi nahin aam aadmi party ne apane soshal media team kii puri kamai party ke samarthak par arvind kejariwal ke kareebi arvind jha ko saunp di
 In the last few months, there has been a big change in the campaign being run by the Aam Aadmi Party against the opposition parties and especially the BJP
 party netaaon or mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal dwaara aakraamak bhashaa or bhoomika ko chhod party ne soshal media par kataaksh or cartoonon kaa sahaara liya
 Arvind Jha, the party's social media in-charge, told Aaj Tak that cartoons have more impact than statements by leaders on social media as cartoons do not require language to speak and would be effective in reaching more people
 Also the message from the cartoon reaches better medium
 kaise bade soshal media par aap ke samarthak?aam aadmi party ke IT cell ke mukhiya arvind jha ne bataaya ki pichley kuch maheenon main party nesoshal mediaper dhaancha gat parivartan kiya he jiske tahat party kii dilli main sarkaar netritv kaaryakartaaon or soshal media team ke bich ek talmail sthapit kiya gaya he jisaki pehle kami thi
 Apart from cartoons on the Aam Aadmi Party's Facebook page and Twitter handle, a small video clip of the decisions and projects of the Kejriwal government is also being shared
 arvind jha kehete hai ki saadhaaran photo ke mukaable in choti-choti video ko zyada samarthan mil rahaa he or jiske jariye aam aadmi party apni baat majboot tareeke se saamne rakh paa rahi he
 On the question of millions of supporters joining the party's social media in four-five months, Arvind Jha said that the Aam Aadmi Party has tried to carry its policies and government's work among the people
 arvind jha ke mutabik dilli ke nagar nigam chunaav tak sarkaar dwaara dilli main kiye ja rahe kaamkaaj ke bare main logon tak jaankaree nahin pahunch paa rahi thi or yah ek badi vajah thi jisase ham logon tak naa pahunch paa rahe the or naa zyada logon ko party se jod paa rahe the
 The Aam Aadmi Party also changed the number of messages asked from its Twitter and Facebook account
 march 2017 tak jahaan ausatan aam aadmi party soshal media par 24 se 30 sandesh post karti thi use ghataakar 16 se 18 kar diya gaya he
 Issues are being discussed on all these posts through videos related to the government or cartoons against the opposition
 aapke soshal media pramukh arvind jha kehete hai ki soshal media par post kii sankhya kam karne ke baavjood uskaa asar zyada dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Arvind Jha says that as an opposition party, we cannot stop questioning the BJP and the central government, because in the current situation, it is necessary to raise questions about the changes that are being seen from economy to social harmony
 arvind jha ne bataaya ki in sawaalon kaa tarika aam aadmi party ne ab badal diya he
 On everything from the economy to the politics of hate, he is trying to surround the government with sarcasm or cartoons
 aam aadmi party agle maheene se soshal media par ek nayaa prayog karne ja rahi he
 Under this experiment, the party will now set up social media teams in all states and under this experiment the functioning of the existing state governments in each state will be compared to the functioning of the Kejriwal government in Delhi
 vipakshi partiyon kii sarkaar or aapaki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj cese tulana ko video athwa graphics ke jariye asardaar content bana kar use soshal media par prasaarit kiya jayega
 How does your social media team work? According to Arvind Singh, a full time social media team is formed and its functioning is reviewed weekly
 samiksha main jis tarah ke content ko zyada samarthak or zyada asar milte hai us tarah ke content ko or aakraamak tareeke se soshal media par prasaarit kar zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchane or unhen jodne kii koshish kii jaati he
 Increase the activism of the leaders
 The Aam Aadmi Party has increased the activism of all its leaders on social media who are seen talking to the media but were not very active on social media
 inamen party ke vidhayakon se lekar bade netaaon tak ko shaamil kiya gaya he or unhen hidaayat di gai he vah soshal media par zyada se zyadanai ranneetike mutabik sakriy rahen
 Not only this, the leaders have been advised to post only and only positively
 rahul gandhi soshal media vivaadarahul gandhi ke soshal media acount or unke twit ko retreat milane ke mudde par baat karte hue aam aadmi party ke soshal media head arvind jha ne aaj tak se kaha ki boats dwaara soshal media acounts kaa prasar nai baat nahin he kyonki yah america main raashtrapati chunaav main bhi dekhne ko mila tha jise rus ne kaaphi istemaal kiya tha
 According to Arvind Jha, the use of boats helps in changing the perspective but it is not full time
 arvind jha ke mutabik sirf boats nahin balki rahul gandhi ke haalia dinon main soshal media par jari bayaan or unki style main aayaa badlaav bhi logon ko pasand aa rahaa he jisaki vajah se unhen samarthan mil rahaa he

 Sanjay Jagdale, who has resigned as BCCI secretary, says that to restore the confidence of sports lovers, a lot of cleanliness is needed
 jagadale ne kaha ki ipel ke spot phixing prakaran se cricket ko baari nuksaan hua he
 Jagdale said in front of some reporters on Saturday, “cricket has suffered a lot due to the fixing incidents in the IPL
 isse ubarne ke liye badi safai kerani padegi
 But this work will not happen so soon, because the loss is very big
 ’62 varshiya khel prashaasak ne kaha ki cricket main phixing ko rokna bada kathin he or bisisiai kii apni simaaen hai, lekin bisisiai apane nigaraanee tantra ko or majboot banaakar phixing par ankush laga saktaa he
 In addition, the BCCI will have to make stringent punishment for the cricketers convicted of fixing
 jagadale ne kaha, ‘cricket premiyon kaa khoyaa vishwaas behaal karne ke liye bisisiai ke sabhi kartadhartaaon ko sabase pehle drudh ichhashakti dikhaani hogi or milakar kadam uthaane honge
 In response to a question, he said that he does not think that bringing the BCCI under the purview of the Right to Information (RTI) Act can help prevent fixing
 jagadale ne kaha, ‘agar srisanth ne (spot phixing ke tahat) qamar main rumal khonskar gend phek di, to isamen artiai kya karegaa
 He said that he was also not in favor of the idea that BCCI or any other sports organization should be brought under the Union Sports Ministry
 jagadale ne varsh 2010 ke dilli rashtramandal khelon main karodon rupee ke kathith ghotaale kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, ‘dilli rashtramandal khel bhi to khel mantralay ke tahat hi hue the

 When asked about this, Jagdale said, 'my resignation has nothing to do with whether Srinivasan quit or not

 Whether or not Srinivasan will resign will be his decision
 ’jagadale ne spasht kiya ki vah chennai main do june ko bisisiai kii apaat baithak main shaamil nahin honge
 He said, 'when i have resigned from the post of BCCI Secretary, i have no means to attend this meeting
 ab main is baithak main kis haisiyat se jaaoongaa
 The senior administrator, however, termed the emergency meeting as 'urgent' and expressed confidence that the 'mature' officials of the BCCI would take decisions in the interest of cricket and the sports organization
 shrinivasana ke damaad gurunath mayppan ko lekar antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) kii chetavanee kii khabaron par jagadale ne kaha, ‘aisi kisi chetavanee kii baat mere sangyaan main kabhi nahin ai

 Jagdale said of his decision not to join the commission set up to investigate the IPL spot-fixing case, "I don't want to be in this commission of inquiry, because i was not comfortable in it
" vaise bhi meraa ipel se zyada judaav nahin rahaa he
 Those people who are directly connected with the operation of IPL should be placed in this commission
 ’kya shrinivasana ke istife ke baad jagadale kaa bisisiai sachiv ke rup main vaapasi kaa vikalp khulaa he, is sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘main (is pad par) vaapasi ke daravaaje kii taraf dekh tak nahin rahaa hum

 ’ Book: Karnaj Wife: The Outcasts Queen's Writer: Kavita Kanaprakshan: Rupa Publication Price: 295 Rupayakavar: Paperback: We all have read the Mahabharata in one form or the other and its characters are well-known
 baat bhishma pitamah kii ho yaa phir netraheen raja dhritarashtra kii, kauravon main sabase bade bhai duryodhana kii yaa phir gandivdharee arjuna kii
 You must have read about all these characters in detail
 lekin kya aapane us kirdaar ke bare main sochaa he jo is mahakavy ke sabase dilachasp kirdaaron main se ek he
 Yes, Danveer Karna
 karn ek aisa kirdaar he jisane apane mitra duryodhana kaa saath nahin choda
 Knowing that he was on the wrong side, he kept his friendship until the last moment
 apane janm kaa sach jaanakar bhi apane bhaaiyon ke khilaaf yuddh kiya
 Why the hell? Many questions related to Karna must have come to the mind of you and all of us and perhaps the writer Kavita Kane also came to mind
 isliye karn kii jindagi ko aadhaar banaate hue unhone 'karnaj wif: da outcasts queen' likh daali
 The poem has very beautifully introduced the importance of Karna in every chapter of Mahabharata
 unhone karn ke bhaavon ko samajhane ke liye ek kaalpanik kirdaar rachaa or usko naam diya 'uruvi'
 Kavita Kane through the Princess of Pukeya and Uruvi, Karna's second wife in the book, has given a new dimension to the Mahabharata
 uruvi yun to he kavita ke dimag kii upaj, lekin jis andaaj se use karn kii zindagi main piroyaa gaya he, vah mahaj kalpana nahin lagati
 The story begins with an archery competition organized by Bhishma Pitamah to present the archery skills of the Kauravas and Pandavas to the world
 jahaan karn bina bulaae pahunche the or yah daawa kiya tha ki vah arjuna se behatar yoddha hai or kuntiputra se tatkaal yuddh karne ko taiyaar he
 It was here that Uruvi first saw Karna
 uske chehre kaa divya tej, uski ankhon kii chamak, uskaa shaktishaalee sharir, uske sunahare kavach or kundal, in sabane uruvi ko pehali nazar main hi baandh liya
 Uruvi fell in love with Karna
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki karn ek sutaputra he, uruvi ne faisla kiya ki vah apane swayamvar main phulon kaa haar karn ke gale main hi daalegi
 Along with Karna, Uruvi embraced her life struggle
 uruvi ne na sirf karn balki uske mata-pita, bhai or pehali patni vrushali ko bhi apanaaya
 Karna was also incomplete without Uruvi
 uruvi ke saamne vah ek khuli kitaab tha or use apni takat samajhataa tha
 Both were very happy in their world together, but a fear and anxiety consumed Uruvi inside and it was her husband's unwavering friendship with Duryodhana
 uruvi ko yah dar tha ki karn kii duryodhana se mitrataa, kahin use apane pati se hameshaa ke liye dur naa kar de
 She knew that Karna's well-being was not against the Pandavas but by standing with them
 mahabharataki har ek mahatvapurn ghatana ko kavita ne karn ke nazariye se bahut hi gaharaai se dikhaaya he
 You should definitely read this book to know more deeply what was going on in Karna's inner soul, what were his thoughts, his feelings
 yah kitaab aapako khud se jod legi, yaa yun kahen ki karn se jod degi
 As beautifully as Karna's feelings have been written, you too will be forced to love this donor
 or rahi baat uruvi kii, to kavita kaane kii daad deni padegi ki unhone bina tode-marode ek kaalpanik kirdaar ke jariye ek vaastavik mahakatha kaa jis sundarata se varnan kiya he vah koi aam baat nahin he
 Every book related to Karna's life has been tried to answer this question
 sabko lagata tha ki dharm ko maanane vaala karn, duryodhana kii mitrataa sweekaar karke khud adharm kii raah par chal padaa
 But this book once again tries to establish the fact that friendship was the biggest religion for Karna and for this friendship he gave his life laughingly

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has once again given a guarantee of a safe return of displaced Kashmiri Pandits on the occasion of Kheer Bhawani Fair on Sunday
 unhone kaha ki visthapit kashmiri panditon kii surakshit vaapasi or punarvaas ke liye rajya sarkaar patibaddh he or harsambhav koshish kar rahi he
 On the Kheer Bhawani temple, it is believed that before the Melan fair, thousands of devotees attended the Kheer Bhawani fair on Sunday in the Kheer Bhawani temple in Kashmir valley
 kheer bhavani mela ghati main kashmiri panditon kaa sab se khaas tyohaar he
 This fair gives displaced Pandits a chance to meet each other after the Kashmiri Pandits migrate from the valley
 yahi kaaran he ki ab is salanaa meley ko milan kaa mela bhi kaha jaataa he
 Kheer comes to Bhavani fair
 Kashmiri Pandits from all over the country, there is a great recognition among the Kashmiri Pandits of worshiping on this occasion in the thousands of years old Maa Durga temple in Tulamul in Ganderbal district of Kashmir valley
 aatankwaad badhane ke baad kashmir se palaayan kar chuke kashmiri pandit is khaas din yani jyeshtha ashtami ke avasar par mandir main hajiri dene se nahin chookte
 Even if he lives anywhere
 meley ke aayojan main jutate hai sthaneey musalamanayah mela kashmir memhindu-muslim bhaichareka pratik bhi he
 Along with the Hindu population of the valley, local Muslims also participate in this fair
 yahaan tak ki puja saamagree se lekar shraddhaluon kii suvidha kaa puraa intjaam bhi yahi log karte hai
 Pandit who have come to meet their loved ones, the situation is getting better in Pandit Kashmir, now there is also hope that many Pandit families who have migrated from the valley are planning to return to the valley

 This is the time when relatives, neighbors and friends who have been separated for years meet here

 Crores of cricketers are talking about Mahendra Dhoni's return to the T20 team, so things are also happening about why Rishabh Pant was not included in the ODI team
 baharhaal, ab chif selector emesake prasad ne safai di he ki rishabh pant kii andekhi kyon kii gai
 After this decision, it will be seen whether this decision will affect the performance of Pant's other two Test matches
 What does @msdhoni's return to the T20 side say? That he wants to play till the T20WC in 2020? Or that selectors / team management not entirely convinced of Rishabh Pant's ‘keeping skills?team chayan ke baad kaaphi logon ne is baat par sawaal uthaae the ki jahaan kharaab form ke baavjood keel rahul ko donon formanton kii team main barkaraar rakhaa gaya, to pant ko vanade main kyon jagah nahin di gai
 However, MSK Prasad did not agree that Pant was made a scapegoat to accommodate another player
 saath hi, unhone ishaara dete hue kaha ki pant bharat kii vishwa cap kii planning se baahar nahin hai

 pehle windid or iske baad australia main khele gaye tii-20 muqablon main dhoni nahin khele jisase pant or karthik ko zyada match khilne kaa mauka mil sake
 And during this time Pant and Karthik have played a lot of matches
 unhone kaha ki yah samay 37 saal ke dhoni kii team main vaapasi kaa samay tha
 Under Dhoni's absence, Pant scored a half-century in three T20 matches played
 pant ne kaha ki hamane saaf taur par kaha tha ki ham dhoni ko chah maichon ke liye aaraam dene ja rahe hai jisase dinesh karthik or rishabh pant ko or samay mil sake
 Prasad said that this was the only reason for Dhoni's return
