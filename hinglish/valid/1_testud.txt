 yah nadi kailash parvat kii uttari taraf se utpann hoti he
 In the 1950s, the People's Republic of China took control of Tibet and since then the Chinese government has also called this river by the names of the Senghe Zangbo and the Shichuan River
 tibeti bhashaa main 'senge kha bab' kaa matlab 'singh mukh nadi' he, yani singh ke mukh se nikalne vaali nadi
 Note that the source-streams of many important rivers of Tibet and India are named after animals having religious significance in Hindu and Buddhist beliefs: buddhi vah maansik shakti he jo vastuon evam tathyon ko samajhane, unamem aapasi sambandh khojane tathaa tarkpurna gyaan praapt karne main sahaayak hoti he
 It is different from 'spirit' and conscience
 buddhi hi manushya ko naveen paristhitiyon ko thik se samajhane or uske saath anukulit hone main sahaayta karti he
 Wisdom can also be understood as 'the ability to process information'
 pracheen kaal se hi buddhi gyanatmak kriyaaon main charchaa kaa vishay rahaa he
 It is said that 'buddhayasya balantasya' means one who has intelligence, is strong
 buddhi ke kaaran hi maanav anya praaniyon se shreshth mana jaataa he
 Wisdom has also been a topic of discussion in the field of psychology
 hajaaron varsh purv se hi vyaktiyon ko buddhi ke aadhaar par alag-alag virgon main baanta gaya
 Some people are called intelligent, some are of low intelligence, some are of dumb intellect and some are called root intelligence
 parantu buddhi ke swaroop ko samajhnaa bada kathin he
 Differences have been going on in the form of intellect since ancient times and even today, for psychologists and academics, intellect remains a subject of debate
 19veen sadi ke uttararddh se bhi buddhi ke swaroop ko samajhane hetu manovaigyanikon ne prayaas prarambh kiye parantu ve bhi isamen safal nahin hue tathaa buddhi kii sarvasammat paribhaasha na de sake
 Even today, there is a disparity in the views of psychologists regarding the nature of intelligence
 alag-alag manovaigyanikon ne buddhi ke swaroop ko alag-alag dhang se paribhaashit kiya
 Psychologists have put the definitions of intelligence into three classes - in teen virgon ke antargat buddhi ko jis tarah paribhaashit kiya gaya unka ullekh is prakaar he- Psychologists such as Terman, Ambigas, Stout, Burt Gaulton Stern, etc
, who hold this type of ideology
 in manovaigyanikon ke anusaar buddhi vyakti kii saamaanya yogyata he, jo uski har kriya main paayi jaati he
 These psychologists have presented the definition of intelligence as- atah terman ke anusaar buddhi samasya ko hal karne kii yogyata he
 The name of Stanford Binay is particularly notable among those who believe in this type of ideology
 bine ke anusaar, buddhi tark, nirnay evam aatm aalochan kii yogyata evam kshamta he
 Under the definitions of this class of intelligence, psychologists have termed the sum of various types of special abilities as intelligence

 situations
) economy adaptations to a goal social value and commergence of originals under such conditions that demand aconcentration of energy and resistance to emotional forces
) The nature of the intellect and the principles of intelligence - both reveal ideas about the subject of intelligence, but still the differences between them are visible
 buddhi ke siddhanth uski sanrachana ko spasht karte hai jabaki swaroop uske kaaryon par prakaash daalate hai
 Since the first decade of the last century, psychologists of different countries grew interested in how the structure of intelligence is and what factors are involved in it
 inhen prashnon ke parinaam swaroop vibhinn karkon ke aadhaar par buddhi kii sanrachana kii vyakhya hone lagi
 Psychologists like Thorston, Thorndike, Thomson etc
 of America expressed their views on the 'nature of intellect' on the basis of factors
 isi tarah france main alfred bine, britain main spirmen ne bhi buddhi ke swaroop ke bare main apane vichaar prastut kiye
 This theory was formulated by the French psychologist Alfred Binay in 1911 and supported by the American psychologist Terman and the German psychologist Ambigas
 is siddhanth ke anusaar buddhi vah shakti he jo samast maansik kaaryon ko prabhavit karti he
 Followers of this theory have considered intelligence as a force affecting all mental functions
 unhone yah bhi mana he ki buddhi samgr rup vaali hoti he or vyakti ko ek vishesh kaary karne main agrasit karti he
 It is a monolithic clause that cannot be divided
 is siddhanth ke anusaar yadi vyakti kisi ek vishesh kshetra main nipun he to vah anya kshetron main bhi nipun rahegaa
 Keeping this same working principle, Binay considered intelligence to be the ability to interpret and decide
 terman ne ise vichaar karne kii yogyata mana he tathaa stern ne ise naveen paristhitiyon ke saath samaayojan karne kii yogyata ke rup main mana he
 The originator of this theory is the famous psychologist Spear Men of Britain
 unhone apane prayogtmak adhyayanon tathaa anubhavon ke aadhaar par buddhi ke is dwi-tatv siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya
 According to him, intelligence is in the form of two powers or there are two factors in the structure of intelligence
 inamen se ek ko unhone 'saamaanya buddhi' tathaa duusare kaarak ko 'vishisht buddhi' kaha he
 By common factor, he implies that all individuals have a common ability to act
 atah prayek vyakti kuch seemaa tak pratyekkarya kar saktaa he
 These tasks are only due to his general intelligence
 saamaanya kaarak vyakti kii sampoorn maansik evam bauddhik kriyaaon main paaya jaataa he parantu yah vibhinn matraaon main hota he
 This common factor of intelligence is congenital and points individuals towards success
 vyakti kii vishesh kriyaayein buddhi ke ek vishesh kaarak dwaara hoti he
 This factor is called the specific factor of intelligence
 ek prakaar kii vishisht kriya main buddhi kaa ek vishisht kaarak kaary karata he to duusari kriya main doosraa vishisht kaarak
 Therefore, different types of specific actions require different types of specific factors
 ye vishisht kaarak bhinn-bhinn vyaktiyon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 For this reason individual differences are found
 buddhi ke saamaanya kaarak janmajaat hote hai jabaki vishisht kaarak adhikanshtah arjeet hote hai
 According to this two-factor theory of intelligence, common factors of intelligence work in all types of mental activity, while specific factors are used independently in specific mental activities
 vyakti ke ek hi kriya main ek yaa kai vishisht karkon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But each mental activity has specific factors as well as general factors related to that action
 jaise- saamaanya vigyaan, saamaajik adhyayan, darshan evam shaastra adhyayan jaise vishyon ko jaanane or samajhane ke liye saamaanya kaarak mahatvapurn samajhe jate hai vahiin yantric, hastkala, kala, sangeet kala jaise vishisht vishyon ko jaanane ore samajhane ke liye vishisht karkon kii pramukh rup se aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is clear from this that to learn a particular subject or art, it is very important to have both factors
 spirmen ne san 1904 main apane purv buddhi ke dvikarak siddhanth main sanshodhan karte hue ek kaarak or jodakar buddhi ke trikaarak siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya
 The third factor of intelligence that he added to his theory is what he called the 'group factor'
 atah buddhi ke is siddhanth main teen kaarak- Have been included
 spirmen ke vichaar main saamaanya tathaa vishisht karkon ke atirikt samooh kaarak bhi samast maansik kriyaaon main saath rahata he
 Some special abilities like mechanical ability, numerical ability, lexical ability, musical ability, memory ability, logical ability and intellectual ability etc
 Group factors also play a special role
 samooh kaarak swayan apane aap main koi swatantra astitv nahin rakhata balki vibhinn vishisht karkon tathaa saamaanya kaarak ke mishran se yah apana samooh banaata he
 That is why it is called group factor
 manovaigyanikon ke anusaar is siddhanth main kisi prakaar kii naveenta nahin he
 Psychologists like Thorndike have criticized the theory that the group factor is not a new factor, but rather a mixture of general and specific factors
 tharnadike ne apane siddhanth main buddhi ko vibhinn karkon kaa mishran mana he
 Which has many merits
 unke anusaar kisi bhi maansik kaary ke liye, vibhinn kaarak ek saath milakar kaary karte hai
 Thorndike criticized the 'general factors' presented in earlier theories and mentioned the basic factors and common factors in their theory instead of the common factors
 mul karkon main mul maansik yogyataon ko sammilit kiya he
 These qualifications are such as - verbal ability, numerical ability, mechanical ability, memory ability, logical ability and speech ability etc
 unke anusaar ye yogyataayen vyakti ke samast maansik kaaryon ko prabhavit karti he
 Thorndike also believes that every person has some specific qualification
 parantu unka yah bhi maananaa he ki vyakti kii ek vishay kii yogyata se duusare vishay main yogyata kaa anumaan lagaana kathin he
 For example, if a person is proficient in mechanical art, it is not necessary that he will also be proficient in music
 unke anusaar jab do maansik kriyaaon ke pratipaadan main yadi dhanatmak sahasambandh paaya jaataa he to uskaa arthi vyakti main sarvanisht kaarak bhi hai
 The amount of these common factors can be known by the amount of correlation
 tharston ke samooh kaarak siddhanth ke anusaar buddhi na to saamaanya karkon kaa pradarshan he na hi vibhinn vishisht karkon kaa, apitu isamen kuchisi nishchit maansik kriyaayein hoti hai jo saamaanya rup se mul karkon main sammilit hoti he
 These mental actions form groups that provide psychological and functional unity
 tharston ne apane siddhanth ko kaarak vishleshan ke aadhaar par prastut kiya
 According to him, the structure of intelligence is made up of a set of fundamental factors
 do yaa adhik mul kaarak milakar ek samooh kaa nirmaan kar lete hai jo vyakti ke kisi kshetra main uski buddhi kaa pradarshan karte hai
 Among these fundamental factors, he considered numerical ability, perceptibility, lexical ability, decimal ability, word fluency, reasoning power and memory power
 tharston ne yah spasht kiya ki buddhi kai prakaar kii yogyataon kaa mishran he jo vibhinn samoohon main pai jaati he
 According to him, mental abilities are functionally independent, yet when they work in a group, there is a correlation or similarity between them
 kuch vishisht yogyataayen ek hi samooh kii hoti hai or unamem aapas main sah-sambandh paaya jaataa he
 Like Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Biological Physics and Chemistry etc
 in a group of science subjects
 isi prakaar sangeet kala ko pradarshit karne ke liye tabalaa, hormonium, sitar aadi bajaane main paraspar sah-sambandh rahata he
 Thomson presented the model theory of intelligence
 unke matanusaar vyakti kaa prayek kaary nishchit yogyataon kaa pratidarsh hota he
 In performing any particular task, a person selects some of his mental abilities as a model
 is siddhanth main unhone saamaanya karkon kii vyaavhaarikta ko mahatv diya he
 According to Thomson, the intellectual behavior of a person depends on many independent abilities, but only his model comes out while doing the examination
 remand ve
 kettl ne do prakaar kii saamaanya buddhi kaa varnan kiya he
 These are fluid and crystallized
 unke anusaar buddhi kii flud saamaanya yogyata vanshanukram karkon par nirbhar karti he jabaki crystallijd yogyata arjeet karkon ke rup main hoti he
 Fluid general ability is found mainly in tests involving culture, movement conditions and adaptability to new conditions
 crystallijd saamaanya yogyata arjeet saanskrithik uplabdhiyon, kaushaltaaon tathaa nai sthiti se sambandhit vaale pareekshanon main ek kaarak ke rup main maapi jaati he
 Fluid general ability can be taken as the hereditary divider of the body which is governed by biochemical reactions
 jabaki crystallijd saamaanya yogyata saamaajik adhigam evam paryaavaran prabhaavon se sanchalit hoti he
 According to Kettle Fluid is related to common sense inheritance and is innate while crystallized general intelligence is acquired
 bart evam varnan ne is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya
 It is considered a new theory in the field of intellect theories
 is siddhanth main bart evam varnan ne maansik yogyataon ko kramik mahatv pradaan kiya he
 He distinguished mental abilities on two levels - saamaanya maansik yogyataon main bhi yogyataon ko unhone staron ke aadhaar par do vargon main vibhajit kiya
 In the first category, he has placed functional, mechanical and physical abilities
 is mukhya varg ko unhone k
m
 naam diya
 In the second group of qualifications, he has put literal, numerical and educational qualifications and in this group he v
ed
 Named
 antim str par unhone vishisht maansik yogyataon ko rakhaa jinka sambandh vibhinn gyanatmak kriyaaon se he
 The novelty of this theory and its special abilities have attracted the attention of many psychologists
 gilford tathaa uske sahyogiyon ne teen maansik yogyataon ke aadhaar par buddhi sanrachana kii vyakhya prastut kii
 This intelligence structure theory of Guilford is called the three-dimensional intellectual model
 unhone buddhi karkon ko teen shreniyon main baanta he, arthath maansik yogyataon ko teen vimaaon main baanta he
 These are kaarak vishleshan se buddhi kii ye teenon vimaayein paryaapt rup se bhinn he
 Apart from all this, there is a theory of intelligence which was propounded by 'howard Gardner', it is called polytheistic theory
 iske anusaar har insaan me alag prakaar kii buddhi hoti he,jaise koi sangeet me paarangat ho saktaa he to koi abhinay me to koi lekhan me,koi taarkik kshamta me aadi
 They have divided it into eight areas to explain this theory of intelligence which are as follows-1-linguistic-2-logical-mathematical-3-country-4-musical-5-physical-motion-sensitive-6-interpersonal-7-inter-person8-naturalist gardenar ne apni pustak "frames of mind: da theory of multiple intelligence" me ise kaaphi achche se vistaarpurvak bataaya he

 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory

 From the place called Rameswaram in the south of India to Sri Lanka, the line of small islands of a shallow land of the sea has gone, people have been believing since ancient times that a story was made to remember any science, But the value of the story in real life, no place belongs to the person or community, just as the three meanings of karma are considered in life, Nasa, covenant and karmana are to be thought of the mind, to be told by the covenant, but the covenant is not of the same type, the tongue is spoken by speaking, the voice is given out through the throat, the nose is spoken Goes, the eyes are talked with gestures, the body is given a hand gesture, the feet are also talked with kick, the stomach is shaken and the back is talked, the shoulders are pulled, the arms are Waving, and move It is also talked about by making a gesture from the face, This imagination can be seen in most dances etc
, in the same way, work is done with the body to perform karma, the mind, intellect and knowledge are used to work with the whole body, to understand the fact of the world
 All the helpful reasons are also used inside, all the people who are connected with home family, friends, and socialism, help in some way, in the same way that the story in the Vedas
 It is said that their purpose can only be considered to discuss body and body related tasks, all the rest is nothing more than pictures made with mental imagination, all the characters of Hindi, if decorated and decorated If written, whatever the deity is, everyone's form comes in front, look at the letter 'A', if it is decorated, it becomes the form of 'ram' with a bow in hand, if the letter 'sha' Gold Should then becomes a form of Krishna, If the letter 'shra' is decorated, it becomes the form of Lakshmi, similarly if a small 'I' is placed above the letter 'sh', then it becomes the form of the letter 'shi', which is often called 'shiva'
 'in which it is imagined that a stream of Ganges comes out of their head, and the word' Shiva 'is applied as soon as the word' corpse 'is in the form of a corpse on top of it
 Which creates a small 'I' as a power Gone, this is why the letter e and e is called the factor of power, the word 'jaw' which is peeled, is a grain and if it is inserted into the ground and incorporates natural factors, then the quantity of large e is applied
 That word 'jaw' becomes the word 'jiva'
 In which it is imagined that a stream of Ganga comes out of their head, and the word 'shiva' is formed when the word 'corpse' which is in the form of a corpse is placed on top of it, in which the small 'I' is formed
 Has been given the form of power, that is why the letters e and e are called the factors of power, the word 'jaw' which is a grain of peel, and if it is inserted into the ground and incorporates natural factors, then As soon as the quantity of large e is applied The term "barley is' the word 'soul'
 In which it is imagined that a stream of Ganga comes out of their head, and the word 'shiva' is formed as soon as the word 'corpse' which is in the form of a corpse is placed on top of it, in which the small 'I' is formed
 Has been given the form of power, that is why the letters e and e are called the factors of power, the word 'jaw' which is a grain of peel, and if it is inserted into the ground and incorporates natural factors, then As soon as the quantity of large e is applied The term "barley is' the word 'soul'
 choti ’i’ or chota ’a’ har shabd ke andar jo bhi pulling yaa streeling he, or jeev se aachhadit he, apni upasthiti prastut karte he, or jo bhi shabd napusingling he, ve apana ishaara bhi isi prakaar se prastut karte he, bada ’aa’ or bady ’i’apni shakti kii purnataa pradaan karti he, bade ’aa’ or bady ’i’ kii maatra kisi bhi shabd ko jodne kaa kaam karte he, shabd ’ram’kaa arth hota he, samaaya hua, or bade ’aa’ kii maatra hi akshar ’r’or ’m’ ko jodkar shabd ’ram’ kaa nirmaan karata he, jo kaarak ’ram’ se ’ram’ ko banane main sahaayak hua he, vahi ’ramsetu’ kehalaata he
 If we look at the Hindi word 'ram' by spreading the map of the world, then the whole surface of the world will be easily seen in the shape of the word "ram", North America and South America can be seen with the letter 'R'
 Look at the amount of large a that is above 'R', and India and China etc
 should be seen as the letter 'M', and if Australia is seen from the expression Bali, the point below 'ram'
 The whole world can be depicted as the name 'rama'

55 22 july ke baad puure 115 saal pratiksha kerani hogi purna surya grahan kii --subeerin 07:30, 2 july 2009 pankaj subir 2july 2009 12;59 aane vaali 22 july ko jo purna suryagrahan hone ja rahaa he wo kai maamalon main anokhaa he
 For the present generation, it cannot be called neither ghost nor future
 kyonki madhyapradesh ke jin kshetron main ye purna suryagrahan dikhaai degaa unamem isse purv ke do sau saalon ke itihaas main kabhi khagrass suryagrahan nahin dikhaai diya he
 Also, that there is no possibility even in one hundred and fifteen years to come
 bharat main surya grahanon ke itihaas par ek shodh pustak par kaary kar rahe sihor ke yuva sahityakar pankaj subir ke anusaar madhyapradesh kaa wo ilaaka jahaan par ye surya grahan khagrass rup main dikhaai degaa vahaan par aisa pichley gyaat itihaas main do sau varshon main nahin hua he
 If we look at the history of the last 200 years, a total of eleven solar eclipses have been seen in India since 1800
 17 july 1814, 19 navambar 1816, 21 disambar 1843, 18 agast 1868, 12 disambar 1871, 22 janvari 1898, 21 agast 1914, 30 june 1954, 16 farvari 1980, 24 oktober 1995 tathaa 11 agast 1999 ye 1800 se lekar ab tak bharat main dikhaai diye purna suryagrahan hai
 Out of all these solar eclipses, it was only in 1898, 1995 and 1999 that the strip of complete solar eclipse passed through Madhya Pradesh, but on all the three occasions, this strip did not pass through Madhya Pradesh, but passed through touching one end
 
 22 janvari 1898 ko khagrass suryagrahan kii pattee us kshetra se gujri thi jo ab chhattisgarh he
 On 24 October 1995, in the Khagraas solar eclipse, the full shadow of the moon had touched Bhind and Morena while on 11 August 1999, it was found touching Barwani Chhabua
 kintu is baar arthath 22 july 2009 ko purna suryagrahan kii lagbhag dhai sau kilometre chaudee pattee puure madhyapradesh ke bichon bich se hokar nikal rahi he tath khargun, khandwa, dhar, indaur, un, devas, sihor, bhopal, harda, hoshangabad, khandwa, sagar, shadol, damoh, reva, satna jaise kshetron se hokar chandramaa kii chaaya surya ko puri tarah se apni oot main liye hue gujaregi
 The shadow of the moon, which will pass through a band about two and a half kilometers wide, is divided into three parts
 pattee kaa donon taraf kaa sabase bahari kinaaraa jahaan keval ek minutes ke liye ye najaara dikhaai degaa, uske andar kaa kshetra jahaan par do minutes ke liye ye najaara dikhegaa or sabase andar kendriya line jiske aasapaas ke ilaakon main ye adbhut khagoleey ghatana puure teen minutes tak dikhaai degi
 According to Shri Pankaj Subir, Sehore, Bhopal, Indore, Rewa, Satna, Hoshangabad, Damoh are on this inner most strip of solar eclipse
 vahiin un devas, khandwa jabalpur jaise kshetra baahar kii pattee par hai
 For this reason, areas like Sehore, Bhopal, Indore, Rewa have more scientific significance
 usamen bhi katni ke murvaara kaa apana alag mahatv he kyonki wo chandramaa kii parachhai ke bilkul kendra main rahegaa
 That is, the areas of the moon from which the shadow of the moon will pass through the earth will come out of the region, including the Muravara
 murvaara se hokar central line of iklips gujaregi
 There is also Surat city of Gujarat on this central line
 grahan main is kendriya rekha kaa bhi vaigyanik prayogon ke liye apana mahatv hota he
 This eclipse is very important for Madhya Pradesh because the full shadow of the moon is passing through almost the whole of Madhya Pradesh
 or bhopal, indore, un, sihor jaise jo ilaake khagrass suryagrahan ke sakshi banane ja rahe hai ve usase pehle ke gyaat itihaas main 1800 se lekar abhi tak is khagoleey ghatana se achoote rahe hai
 Yes, in 1995 and 1999, this shadow came out very close
 shri subir ke anusaar iske baad madhyapradesh ke in kshetron ko lagbhag 115 saal kii pratiksha phir se kerani hogi is anuthi ghatana kaa sakshi banane ke liye
 Because after this, on 14 May 2124, the strip of complete solar eclipse will pass through this area
 halanki is purna suryagrahan ke baad bharat main 20 march 2034 tathaa 3 june 2114 ko bhi purna surya grahan dikhaai degaa lekin 2034 main wo keval kashmir ke kuch ilaakon tak simit rahegaa vahiin 2114 main rajasthan upi or bengal main dikhaai degaa
 In this way, this solar eclipse is not going to be a ghost or future for the residents of Madhya Pradesh because in the last two hundred years, there has not been a complete solar eclipse in these areas and there is no possibility again for the coming 115 years
 arab sagar main gujarat se prarambh hokar chandramaa kii chaaya surya ko puri tarah se apane peeche chupaaye hue madhyapradesh se hote hue uttar pradesh, bihar se hote hue china kii taraf nikal jaayegi
 The biggest obstacle that is coming in the way of seeing this unique astronomical is the weather, because it will be cloudy due to the rainy season on July 22
 jo bhi ho lekin 22 july kaa din madhyapradesh ke nivaasiyon ke liye to khaas he hi
 The center of the shadow of the moon will be on the village of Gularpura, the sun and the moon will pass through Larkui and Chakaldi The central line of Khagraas solar eclipse coming on July 22 is important in many ways for Sehore district
 pehla to ye ki sihor ke gyaat itihaas main ye pehla khagrass surya grahan he joki puure sihor jile main dikhaai degaa doosraa ye ki iske baad is sadi main koi bhi purna surya grahan is ilaake main nahin dikhaai degaa
 The central line of the eclipse of July 22, which is called the Central Line of Eclipse in scientific language, will pass through the Nasrullaganj area of the district
 gularpura gaanv kaa vaigyanik mahatv adhik isaliye he kyonki ye gaanv grahan ke kendra main rahegaa
 According to Sehore's young litterateur Pankaj Subir, there is a lot of curiosity about the complete solar eclipse that appears in the district on 22 July
 isaliye bhi kyonki pichley do sau saalon ke itihaas main pehali baar aisa ho rahaa he ki jile main se hokar grahan kii kendriya rekha nikal rahi he
 And because of that, complete solar eclipse will be seen in the entire district
 suryagrahan ke dauraan ek puri chaudee pattee main khagrass suryagrahan dikhaai detaa he
 This time this strip is about two and a half kilometer wide
 is pattee kii kendriya rekha bhi hoti he jis par grahan kii avadhi adhik samay hoti he
 This time, the Sehore district is completely in that two and a half kilometer wide strip, but the special thing is that the Central Line of Eclipse is also passing through the district
 gularpura ke thik upar se hokar ye kendriya rekha nikal rahi he
 The importance of Gulerpura from a scientific point of view is more because all scientific experiments are done on this central line
 jile main lagane vaale purna suryagrahan par shodh patr taiyaar kar rahe sahityakar pankaj subir ke anusaar is baar grahan kii kendriya rekha hamaare jile se hokar nikal rahi he
 This central line will pass through Suapani village near the river Seep in Nasrullaganj tehsil via right between Khategaon and Kannod
 is kendriya rekha ke thik neeche jo gaanv pad rahaa he wo laadakui se paanch kilometre kii duuri par sthit gaanv gularpura he
 After this, the central line of the eclipse will cross the Larkui and Nasrullaganj road about 3
5 km from Larkui, this place is also coming just below the central line of the eclipse
 iske baad ye grahan kii kendriya rekha aage kii ore bad jaayegi tathaa chakaldi gaanv se kuch duuri se hokar niklegi, iske baad kolar nadi ke thik paas se hoti hui raisen jile main pravesh kar jaayegi
 This central line of eclipse will originate from the district parallel to the Narmada River, which forms the southern boundary of Sehore district
 is prakaar nasrullagunj tehsil kaa vaigyanik mahatv grahan ke dauraan sabase adhik rahegaa kyonki grahan kii kendriya rekha isi kshetra se hokar niklegi
 However, the entire Sehore district is going to witness the eclipse of the Khagraas solar eclipse, the innermost part of the entire solar eclipse will be seen on the two and a half kilometer wide strip, that is, the entire Sehore district in about sixty-sixty kilometers on either side of the central line
 It is therefore that the eclipse of Khagraas will be seen in the entire district
 lekin phir bhi yadi grahan kii kendriya rekha se duuri kii baat kii jaye to nasrullagunj se lagbhag aath kilometre, rehati se 6 kilometre, sihor se 30 kilometre, ichhaavar se 20, budni se 10 tathaa ashta se 25 kilometre kii duuri is rekha kii rahegi
 The closest will be Larkui which will be only three and a half kilometers away
 shampur, bhadakui, chakaldi, kolar ye wo gaanv hai jo ki is rekha ke najadik rahengen
 But the most discussed will be Gularpura, just above which the center of the moon's shadow will pass
 kya hoti he grahan kii kendriya rekha : chandramaa kii parachhai prithvi par vrittakar rup main padati he
 The focal point of this circle moves in a straight line as the shadow moves forward
 ye saral rekha hi kehalaati he grahan kii kendriya rekha 
 This time too, when the shadow of the moon rises through Gujarat to the northeast through Madhya Pradesh, the focal point of the shadow will remain the center of attraction of scientists, and in the southern part of Sehore district, this center will pass through the Sip River, Gularpura, Kolar River and the mountain
 Will pass through the area
 kya mahatv he kendriya rekha kaa : pankaj subir ke anusaar grahan kii kendriya rekha par grahan kii avadhi kuch adhik bhi hoti he tathaa chunki ye chaaya kaa kendra hota he at: yahaan par grahan bilkul purna hota he
 For scientific experiments, the Central Line of Eclipse is considered to be the most suitable as the shadow of the moon and the center of the Sun become unified here
 gularpura jahaan se hokar chaaya kaa kendra nikalegaa wo sadak maarg se keval do kilometre hone ke kaaran pahunch main bhi he at: vaigyanikon kaa jamaavada yahaan ho saktaa he
 The same situation is also on Nasrullaganj road, 3
5 km from Larkui
 ye dono hi sthaan vaigyanik prayogon ke liye sabase achche sthaan hai
 Where is Gularpura: The road from Larkui to Nasrullaganj is about four and a half kilometers on the right hand side to Gularpura from where Gularpura, village of Nasrullaganj tehsil is located at a distance of two kilometers
 vaigyanik bhashaa main ye gaanv 22
779357 degree uttar akshansh tathaa 77
238473 purv deshaansh par sthit he
 It will be dark in Sehore on July 22, it will be twice in the morning, on July 22, the path of complete solar eclipse will pass through India
 is path ke bilkul bich main aa rahaa he sihor
 This means that on the coming July 22 in Sehore, it will be dark during the day itself and the sun will hide behind the shadow of the moon
 isse purv 16 farvari 1980 tathaa 24 ak?tobar 1995 ko sihor kshetra suryagrahan kii pattee main to nahin aayaa tha lekin wo pattee sihor ke bahut paas se hokar nikali thi tathaa uske kaaran din main hi raat ho gai thi
 On July 22, 2009, Sehore region is also going to witness that wonderful event called Khagrass solar eclipse
 darasal is baar sihor kshetra se hokar purna suryagrahan kii pattee guzar rahi he
 In India, this strip will pass through Surat, Vadodara, Indore, Bhopal, Varanasi, Patna, Patna, Darjeeling
 pichhali baar ke do purna suryagrahan ke samay sihor is pattee main nahin tha kintu wo pattee sihor ke bahut najadik se hokar nikali thi isaliye un dona hi suryagrahan ke samay bhi din main andhera chaane kii sthiti nirmit ho gai thi
 For this, darkness will cover the entire area for about three minutes, because at that time the shadow of the moon will cover these areas
 bharat main ye suryagrahan praat: 5 bajkar 28 minutes par prarambh hoga tathaa 7 bajkar 40 minutes tab bharat se hokar chandramaa kii chaaya gujaregi
 This solar eclipse will be visible for about 3 minutes and 38 seconds in the region where Sehore is coming
 ye suryagrahan lambi avadhi kaa surya grahan he
 On July 22, shortly after the sun rises in the morning, the moon will come between the sun and the earth and shortly after dawn it will be night again
 kuch der baad phir se surya nikalegaa tathaa phir se subah ho jaayegi
 Thus, on 22 July, the residents of Sehore will be witness to the unique event of dawn
 ye is sadi kaa sabase lambii avadhi kaa khagrass surya grahan hoga
 The solar eclipse will be in Pushya Nakshatra and Cancer
 grahan kaa sparsh subah 5
23 baje hoga
 Eclipse salvation will be at 7

 22 july ko hone vaala yah surya grahan prithvi par 240 kimi kii ek pattee kshetra main purna rup se dekha ja sakegaa
 India will begin the full shadow of the Moon on the Sun
 baad main yah chaaya nepal, bangladesh, bhutan, myanmar va china japan aadi deshaa tak surya par padegi
 Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Shu planets will also be visible during solar eclipse
 surya se 9 degree purv main budh grah ore 41 degree pashchim main shu grah ko dekha ja sakegaa
 Mars will be right next to the west of Shu
 brihaspati pashchim main neeche kii ore dekha ja sakegaa
 Apart from these, Prokian, Serious, Betelgeus, Rigel and Cipella stars will also be seen
 grahan ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan karne ke liye 22july ko bady sankhya main desh va videsh ke vaigyanik prabhavit jila main jutenge at: ummid he ki sihor main bhi us din desh videsh ke vaigyanika kaa jamavada ho saktaa he
 Because the strip from Indore to Bhopal is coming right in the center of the moon shadow on which Sehore is located
 22 july ko hone vaala purna surya grahan surat, indore, sihor, bhopal, jabalpur, elahabaad, varanasi, patna ko milaane vaali pattee par dikhaayi degaa
 At the time of full solar eclipse on July 22, the shape of the sun will appear as a diamond ring in Sehore
 ukt pattee se baahar ke jila main keval aanshik surya grahan hi dikhaayi degaa
 What is Solar Eclipse - Solar eclipse is the astronomical position of the Earth, Moon and Sun in which the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun
 chandramaa surya ke prakaash ko prithvi par aane se roak detaa he nateeja din ke vakt andhera chaa jaataa he
 Earlier on 16 February 1980, 24 October 1995, 11 August 1999, a total solar eclipse was seen in the country
 kin?tu us samay sihor purna surya grahan kii pattee main na hokar aanshik suryagrahan kii pattee par tha
 On 16 February 1980, the full solar eclipse strip passed through Sehore
 24 ak?tobar 1995 ko jab ek baar phir purna surya grahan bharat main dikhaai diya tha tab bhi sihor main purna surya grahan to nahin dikhaa tha lekin phir bhi andhera ho gaya tha
 The special thing is that Diwali was also on that day, but due to solar eclipse, it was celebrated on the second day
 1980 main shaam ke samay suryagrahan dikhaai diya tha jabaki 1995 main ekadam subah grahan hua tha tathaa ab 22 july ko ek baar phir se subah grahan lagane ja rahaa he
 Do not cloud the fun, this time because the solar eclipse is coming in the rainy month, so the fun of solar eclipse is likely to deteriorate due to badla

 The process of generating energy as a result of oxidation of food in living cells is called cellular respiration
 yah ek ketabolic kriya he jo oxygen kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti donon hi avasthaaon main sampann ho sakati he
 The energy released during this activity is stored and stored in a biomolecule called ATP, which is used by the organism in its various biological functions
 yah jaev-rasinic kriya paudhon evam jantuon donon kii hi koshikaon main din-raat har samay hoti rahati he
 Cells use glucose, amino acids and fatty acids as food substances to oxidise the atom of oxygen to take electrons
 koshikeey shwasan evam shwaas kriya main abhinn sambandh he evam ye donon kriyaayein ek-duusare kii poorak hai
 Breathing activity occurs between living organisms and their environment
 iske dauraan sajiv evam unke vaataavaran ke bich oxygen evam carbon dioxide gas kaa aadan-pradaan hota he tathaa is kriya dwaara oxygen gas vaataavaran se sajivon ke shwasan angon main pahunchati he
 Oxygen gas enters the blood by diffusion from the respiratory organs
 rakt parivahan kaa madhyam he jo is oxygen ko sharir ke vibhinn bhaagon kii koshikaon main pahunchaa detaa he
 There cells use it in their cellular respiration
 shwasan kii kriya prayek jivit koshika ke koshika dravya evam mitocandria main sampann hoti he
 Respiratory preparatory functions occur in the cytoplasm and the remaining functions occur in the mitochondria
 chunki kriya ke antim charan main hi adhikansh urja utpann hoti hai
 Therefore, mitochondria are called the respiratory tract of the cell
 shwasan kii kriya ke pratham charan main shwasan-dravyon main chali jaati he tathaa shesh 96 pratishat urja piruvik amla main sanchit ho jaati he
 In the first five steps of glycolysis, the 6-carbon specific glucose molecule is decomposed into a three-carbon molecule using energy
 crebs chakra oxic shwasan kii duusari avasthaa he
 It occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cell fluid of prokaryotes
 is kriya main glicolisis kaa ant padaarth piruvik amla purna rup se oxykrut hokar carbon dioxide or jal main badal jaataa he tathaa aise anek padaarthon kaa nirmaan hota he jinka upyog anya jaev-rasinic paripathon main amino amla, purine, pirimidin, fatty amla evam glucose aadi ke nirmaan main hota he tathaa adhik maatra main urja mukt hoti he
 This action takes place in several stages and acts as a circle
 is chakra kaa adhyayan sarvapratham hans adolf creb ne kiya tha, unheen ke naam par is kriya ko crebs chakra kehete hai
 The first action of this action is citric acid, so this process is also called citric acid cycle
 citric amla main 3 carboxylic mulak upasthit rahata he atah ise tri carboxylic cycle yaa tisie chakra bhi kehete hai
 In the cyclic reactions of the Krebs cycle, complete oxidation of pyruvic acid gives out one molecule of carbon dioxide at three places throughout the cycle, that is, three carbon atoms of pyruvic acid leave three molecules as carbon dioxide
 shwasan kriya ke creb chakra ke dauraan pyruvik amla oxeloacetic amla se kriya karata he
 It consists of three co-enzymes
 sarvapratham piruvik amla injim kii upasthiti main oxykrut hokar carbon dioxide tathaa hydrogen main badal jaataa he
 The hydrogen dioxide receptor combines with NAD to form NADH 2 and the carbon dioxide gas is released into the atmosphere
 enediech tu main upasthit hydrogen kai shwasan injimon kii usthiti main oxygen se milakar jal main badal jaataa he tathaa urja mukt hoti he
 This energy is combined with ADP and stored as ATP
 ek anu glucose ke purna rup se oxikaran ke falswaroop 38 anu atipi kaa nirmaan hota he
 ATP is a repository of energy, also called energy currency
 atipi main sanchit urja jeevon ke aavashyaktaanusaar vighatit hokar urja mukt hoti he jisamen jeevon kii vibhinn jaivik kriyaayein sanchalit hoti he
 Oxidative respiration does not require oxygen and it occurs in the absence of oxygen
 is kriya main bhojan kaa apurna oxikaran hota he
 Carbon dioxide and lactic acid are formed as a result of this action in animals and in plants carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol are formed and a very small amount of energy is released
 is prakaar kaa shwasan kuch nimna shrenee ke paudhon, yeast, jeevanu, evam antah paraseete jantuon jaise golkrimi, feetakrimi, monocystis ityadi main hota he
 Under certain circumstances, high-grade animals, plant tissues, seeds, juicy fruits, etc
 also occur in the absence of oxygen
 manushyon yaa ucch shrenee ke jeevon kii mansapeshiyon ke thakne kii avasthaa main yah shwasan hota he
 The organisms that have this respiration are called Nairobes
 oxic shwasan ke samaan hi anaksi shwasan ke prarambh main glicolisis kii kriya hoti he jiske ant main piruvik amla banataa he
 In the further process, there is no complete oxidation of pyruvic acid due to lack of oxygen, so this respiration produces much less energy than oxygen respiration
 paudhon main yah piruvik amla carboxillej injim kii upasthiti main acitaldihide or carbon daai oxide main badal jaati he
 This is then degraded by NADH2 in the presence of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, and is converted to NAD and ethyl alcohol
 praaniyon kii peshiyon tathaa kuch jeevanuon main oxygen kii anupasthiti main glicolisi ke ant main nirmit piruvik amla NADH2 kii sahaayta se lactic amla main badal jaataa he
 Fermentation is a specific chemical action of anoxic respiration
 isamen sookshm jeevon tathaa injimon kii upasthiti main jatil carbonic yogicon kaa vighatan saral yogicon ke rup main hota he
 Fermentation occurs in yeast, lactobacillus and sprouted seeds
 kinvan kii kriya ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- alcoholic kinvan tathaa amleey kinnav
 In the process of alcoholic fermentation, glucose is dissolved in ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide and some energy is released
 yah east tathaa ankurit beej aadi main hoti he
 gimase is an enzyme produced by Ist
 amleey kinvan jeevanu evam mansapeshiyon main hoti he
 Acids are formed in it
 iskaa aarthik mahatva bhi he
 With its help, alcohol, vinegar, curd etc
 are produced and chemical materials are produced in the craft industry
 shwasan kii kriya main carbon daai-oxide kaa vah aaytan jo baahar nikalataa he tathaa jitna aaytan oxigen kaa avasorana hota he uske anupaat ko shwasan bhagfal kehete hai
 It is always represented in numbers such as - 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1 Respiratory quotient indicates which type of food is being oxidized in respiration, as this ratio is different in different foods
 shwasan kii kriya main upyog main aane vaale khadyapadaarthon ke aadhaar par iskaa maan ikai, ikai se kam, ikai se adhik hota he
 When the food substance that is oxidized to respiration is carbohydrate, then the value of the respiratory quotient is unit, such as in seeds of germinated wheat
 jab shwasan main upyog hone vaala khadyapadaarth vasa yaa protein ho tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai se kam hota he
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + Energy shwasan main upyog aane vaala khadyapadaarth jab protein hota he tab shwasan-gunank kaa maan 0
4 se 0
9 tak ho saktaa he
 If we know the value of RQ, then we can guess what kind of food is being reacted in respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main paudhe prakaash kii upasthiti main vaataavaran se carbon daai-oxide ko grahan karte hai tathaa oxigen gas vaataavaran main mukt karte hai
 It is natural to increase the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere and decrease of carbon dioxide, but in reality it is not so
 shwasan kii kriya main sajiv din or raat har samay oxigen gas grahan karte hai tathaa carbon daai-oxide gas kaa vaataavaran main tyaag karte hai
 In this way, the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere is maintained by respiration
 shwasan ek urja-unmochan prakriya he
 In respiration, food is oxidized, releasing the accumulated energy
 shwasan ke samay mukt urja kaa kuch bhaag koshika ke mitocondria main atipi ke rup main sanchit ho jaati he
 This energy, accumulated in the form of ATP, is used to carry out various biological functions of living organisms in future
 mukt honi vaali ooshmiya urja sajivon ke sharir ke tapakram ko santulit banaae rakhane main sahaayta karti he
 Light is produced from the bodies of some insects and sea animals
 yah prakaash shwasan dwaara utpann urja kaa hi ek roopaantarit rup he
 The body of some marine organisms such as electric ray fish and torpedoes, etc
 generates electric waves for self-defense, it is produced by the conversion of energy generated by electric respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon d-oxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbon daai-oxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials
 sajivon ke sharir main prayek koshika main jaev-rasinic kriyaayein hoti rahati hai
 Daily energy is required to perform these actions
 urja kaa mukhya strot bhojan he
 Solar energy is stored as potential energy in food
 shwasan kriya main shwasan kaa mukhya padaarth glucose kaa oxigen kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti main purna yaa apurna oxikaran hota he, jiske falswaroop bhojan main sanchit sthitij urja gatij urja ke rup main mukt hota he, jisase jivan kii dainik kriyaaon ke sampaadan hetu aavashyak urja kaa unmochan tathaa purti hoti he
 The glucose required for oxidation in respiration is produced between nutrition
 poshan ke liye aavashyak urja, shwasan kriya main utpann urja se praapt hoti he
 In this way, respiration and nutrition are inextricably related to each other
 koshikeey shwasan ke dwaara atipi nirmaan ke liye adhikansh sajiv shwasan kii vaatapekshi vidhi par nirbhar hai parantu kram-vikaas ke dauraan pehle vatanirpekshi shwasan kaa vikaas hua tha
 The absence of oxygen gas in the Earth's atmosphere was one of the first evolving atmospheric respiration
 4
6 billian varsh pehle prithvi ke vayumandal main mukhya gaisen carbon daai-oxide, nitrogen, jal vaashp evam hydrogen sulphide thim
 It was in this environment that the first unicellular organism originated 3
5 billion years ago
 ye prokariots the
 Their cellular structure was very simple
 chunki vaataavaran main swatantra oxygen nahin tha isliye in sajivon main shwasan kii vatanirpekshi prakriya kaa vikaas hua jiske liye oxygen kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati he
 After this, these prokaryotes ruled the earth for about 1 billion years
 inamen apana bhojan swayan banane ke liye prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya hoti thi
 In the process of photosynthesis, carbohydrates are formed with the help of carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and oxygen gas is released
 is mukt hue oxygen kaa pariman dhire-dhire vaataavaran main badhane laga
 In the presence of oxygen, a new method of respiration developed in living cells that could produce more ATP
 is vidhi ke dwaara koshikaaye pehle se adhik urja utpann karne lageen
 This led to their increasing size and the evolution of complex eukaryotic organisms from simple prokaryotes
 inhen eukariotic jeevon se vartmaan samay ke shaiwal, kavak, padap evam jantuon kaa vikaas hua he jinamein koshikeey shwasan atyant viksit he
 If bio-evolution of cellular respiration had not happened, perhaps even today, ancient prokaryotic organisms would have ruled the earth
 prastut sarini main koshikeey shwasan kii puri kriyavidhi kaa sankshep main vivaran he
 The description of how much ATP is being produced by using the energy generated in each phase shows the importance of the reaction
 2 ATP4 ADP2 NAD2 Pi 2 ADP4 ATP2 NADH2 h + 2 NADH2 H+ 2 CO22 NAD 4 ADP4 Pi2 ATP 2 CO24 ATP2 ADP 2 ATP4 ADP2 NAD2 Pi 2 ADP4 ATP2 NADH2 h + 2 coa-s-h2 NAD 2 CO22 NADH2 h + 6 H2O2 ADP2 Pi6 NAD2 FAD 4 CO22 ATP6 NADH6 h + 2 FADH2 10 NADH10 H+2 FADH2 10 NAD12 h + 2 FAD 34 ADP34 Pi 34 ATP 2 FADH2 se 4 atipi 3 O26 H2O40 ADP40 Pi2 ATP 6 H2O40 ATP2 ADP Interlanguage translation is a translation between one symbol arrangement of the same language to another symbol arrangement of the same language

 film kaa sabase prachlit gaanaa keke dwaara rachit tu mujhe soch kabhi rahaa Geography is the scripture by which knowledge of the upper form of the earth and its natural divisions is known
 prakritik vigyaanon ke nishkarshon ke bich kaary-kaaran sambandh sthapit karte hue prithvital kii vibhinnataaon kaa maanviya drushtikon se adhyayan hi bhugol kaa saar tatv he
 The reason for the similarities and differences of the places which are special on the surface of the Earth is the private field of geography
 bhugol shabd do shabdon bhu yani prithvi or gol se milakar bana he
 Geography on the one hand uses the knowledge gained from other chain sciences to the extent that it helps in reviewing events and analyzes and coordinating their relations as much as possible
 duusari ore anya vigyaanon se praapt jis gyaan kaa upyog bhugol karata he, usamen anek vyutpattik dharanaayen evam nirdhaarit vargeekaran hote hai
 If these assumptions and classifications are not useful for geographical purposes, then geography has to develop private etymological assumptions and systems of classification
 at: bhugol maanviya gyaan kii vruddhi main teen prakaar se sahaayak hota he: Ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes first recognized geography as a distinct science of the ground
 iske baad herodotus tathaa roman vidwaan strabo tathaa cladius tolmi ne bhugol ko suniitihaashshchit swarup pradaan kiya
 In this way, in geography, 'where', 'how' when 'why' and 'how many' questions are properly interpreted
 bhugol ek pracheenatam vigyaan he or isaki neenv praarambhik unani vidwaanon ke kaaryon main dikhaai padati he
 The term geography was first used by the Greek scholar Ertosthenes in the third century BC

 The most important part of our eye is the retina which is a light-sensitive layer of cells and is inside the eye
 retina par focus karne vaale prakaash ko najuk tareeke se vistrut sandesh main tabdeel karne ke liye retina kii kai parat milakar kaam karti he jo mastishk main vijual cortex tak jaataa he
 The macula plays a key role in this
 macula retina kaa vah hissaa hota he jo hamen baariki or vistaar ke saath dur kii vastuon or rang ko dekhne main madad karata he
 Sometimes the retina's ability to absorb fluid is affected due to leakage of fluid in the retina, so that macular edema occurs
 jaise agar jameen par adhik barish hoti he to vahaan keechad ho jaataa he or aap atirikt pani ko nikaalkar pani ko surakshit rakh sakate hai
 Similarly, when there is excess fluid in the retina and there is swelling in the retina, it is called macular edema
 macular edima paidaa karne vaale sambhavit karkon main nimna sthitiyaan shaamil hai: Excess of fluid from blood vessels · aankh main inflameshan kaa badhanaa Relationship to abnormal blood vessels growth macular edima main macula kii paraton main taral padaarth kaa asaamaanya jamaav ho jaataa he
 Because of inflammation in the retina, it distorts images, making it more difficult to see clearly
 sujan jitna adhik vyapak, motaa or gambhir hoga, vyakti ko utana hi adhik dhundhala or aspasht dikhaai degaa or use padhane main utani hi adhik kathinaayee hogi
 If left untreated for macular edema, chronic macular edema can cause permanent damage to the macula and can also cause permanent loss of vision
 mecular edima aam taur par kshatigrast retinal rakt vahikaaon se adhik risaav yaa retina main gaharaai main asaamaanya rakt vahikaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran hota he
 New blood vessels do not normally have 'tight junctions' and this is almost always due to abnormal leakage of fluid into the retina
 macular edima koi beemaari nahin he, balki yah kisi beemaari kaa parinaam he
 Macular edema can occur for a number of reasons including: · metabolic sthitiyaan Blood vessel disease · umr kaa badhanaa · hereditary disease · macula par trection Inflammatory conditions · vishaaktata Eye tumor · trama Surgical cause · agyaat kaaran Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography are two common tests to evaluate macular edema
 in pareekshanon main taral padaarth kii upasthiti ke aadhaar par, macular edima kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki yah kitna vyapak, sthaneey, yaa macula ke centre ke aas-paas ke kai chote fafole kaa bana he
 This is a common condition called cystoid macular edema
 macular edima ke liye sabase prabhavi upachaar ranneetiyon main iske antarnihit kaarnon ke saath- saath macula main or uske aasapaas asaamaanya rakt vahikaaon se taral ke atyadhik risaav ko thik karnaa he
 Eye drops, lasers, and surgery can be effective in many diseases, but the mainstay of treatment is intravital injection
 yadi macular edima ek hi jagah par he to focal lager kiya ja saktaa he
 IVI is a day care procedure performed with the help of topical anesthesia in which very small amounts of the drug are injected into the eye with a small needle
 injection lagane main saamanytah koi dard nahin hota he
 IVI should be performed by a trained retina specialist who can do this by paying close attention to the efficacy of the treatment and detecting rare but potentially serious complications
