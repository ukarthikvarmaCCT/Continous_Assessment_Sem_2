 One use of this term is to refer to a webmail client: an e-mail client used as a web application accessed through a web browser

 Practically every webmail provider provides access to e-mail using a webmail client, and many of them also provide access to e-mail by a desktop e-mail client using standard e-mail protocols, while Many Internet service providers serve a webmail client as part of the e-mail service included in their Internet service package

 One of its main disadvantages is the necessity of establishing a connection to the Internet while using it
 web ke praarambhik dinon main 1994 or 1995 main kai log ek web broujar par i-mail kii pahunch ko sakriya karne par kaam kar rahe the
 In Europe, Soren Wegeram and Luka Manunza released their "WWW Mail" and "webmail" applications, while in the United States, Matt Mankins wrote "webex"
 Each of these early applications were Perl scripts that contained complete source code available for download
 1994 main bhi bill filter ne california ke mountain vyuu main lotus sisi:mail main rahakar windos anti par si main likhe gaye ek sijiai program ke rup main web-aadhaarit i-mail ke ek prayog par kaam shuru kiya or janvari 1995 main ise saarvajanik rup se lotsphere main pradarshit kiya

iske vipareet aise program bhi hai jo webmel tak pahunch ke liye kisi web brouzar kaa anukaran kar sakate hai maano ki ise piopi3 yaa iemepi account main store kiya gaya ho
 However they are susceptible to changing the user interface of the web service as it does not have any standard interface
 kuch seva pradaata anya i-mail sarvaron ke liye web tak pahunch pradaan karte hai
 This allows access to mailboxes where the mail server does not provide a web interface or where an alternate interface is desired

 After some time, Rama departed from Chitrakoot and reached the ashram of Atri Rishi

 From there, Rama then proceeded further and met Sharbhang Muni

 And on proceeding, Rama was seen piling up bones from place to place, about whom the monks told Rama that the demons have eaten many sages and those are the bones of those sages
 is par ram ne pratigya kii ki ve samast rakshason kaa vadh karke prithvi ko rakshas viheen kar denge
 Rama proceeded further and met the sages like Sutixhan, Agastya etc
 in the path and entered Dandaka forest where he met Jatayu
 ram ne panchvati ko apana nivas sthaan banaaya
 In Panchavati, Ravana's sister Shurpanakha came and pleaded with Rama
 ram ne yah kah kar ki ve apni patni ke saath hai or unka chota bhai akelaa he use lakshmana ke paas bhej diya
 Laxman, rejecting his love, knowing the sister of the enemy, cut his nose and ears
 shurpanakha ne khar-dooshan se sahaayta kii maang kii or vah apni sena ke saath ladane ke liye aa gaya
 In the battle, Rama killed Khar-foul and his army
 shurpanakha ne jaakar apane bhai ravan se shikaayat kii
 Ravana sent Marich as a goldmine to take revenge, whose bark was demanded by Sita to Rama
 lakshmana ko sita ke raksha kii ajna de kar ram swarnamrig rupi marich ko maarane ke liye uske peeche chale gayi
 Marich was killed at the hands of the dying, but while dying, Marich made a voice of Rama and chanted 'ha Lakshman', which Sita apprehensively sent Lakshman to Rama
 lakshmana ke jane ke baad akeli sita kaa ravan ne chhalpurvak haran kar liya or apane saath lanka le gaya
 On the way, Jatayu fought with Ravana to save Sita and Ravana cut his wings and made him half dead
 sita ko na paa kar ram atyant duhkhi huye or vilaap karne lage
 On meeting Jatayu on the way, he told Rama about his plight by Ravana and to take Sita to the south
 ye sab bataane ke baad jataayu ne apane praan tyaag diye or ram uskaa antim sanskaar karke sita kii khoj main saghan van ke bheetar aage bade
 On the way Rama slaughtered the Gandharva Kambandha, who became a demon due to the curse of Durvasa, and reached the ashram of Shabari where he ate the false beers given by him under his devotion
 is prakaar ram sita kii khoj main saghan van ke andar aage badhate gayi
 Rama came near Rishimuk mountain
 us parvat par apane mantriyon sahit sugriv rahata tha
 Sugriva, fearing that Bali might not have sent the two heroes to kill him, sent Hanuman as a Brahmin to get information about Rama and Lakshmana
 yah jaanane ke baad ki unhen baali ne nahin bheja he hanuman ne ram or sugriv main mitrataa karvaa di
 Sugriva consoled Rama that Janaki ji would be found and he would help in finding him as well as told about the atrocities committed on his brother Bali
 ram ne baali kaa chhalpurvak vadh kar ke sugriv ko kiskindha kaa rajya tathaa baali ke putr angad ko yuvaraj kaa pad de diya
 After attaining the kingdom, Sugriva indulged in luxury and the rain and autumn passed
 ram kii naaraazgi par sugriv ne vaanron ko sita kii khoj ke liye bheja
 The apes looking for Sita saw a tapaswini in a cave
 tapaswini ne khoj dal ko yogashakti se samudratat par pahunchaa diya jahaan par unki bhent sampaati se hui
 Sampati tells the monkeys that Ravana has placed Sita in Lanka Ashokavatika
 jambavant ne hanuman ko samudr langhane ke liye utsahit kiya
 Hanuman departed towards Lanka
 surasa ne hanuman kii pariksha lee or use yogya tathaa samarthyavan paakar aashirwad diya
 En route, Hanuman slayed the demon that caught the shadow and entered Lanka by striking Lankini
 unki vibhishana se bhent hui
 Ravana was threatening Sita when Hanuman arrived at the Ashokavatika
 ravan ke jane par trijata ne sita ko santavana di
 On solitude, Hanuman met Sita and gave him the ring of Rama
 hanuman ne ashokavatika kaa vidhwans karke ravan ke putr akshay kumaar kaa vadh kar diya
 Meghnath tied Hanuman in Nagpash and took him to the assembly of Ravana
 ravan ke prashn ke uttar main hanuman ne apana parichay ram ke doot ke rup main diya
 Ravana tied a cloth immersed in oil on Hanuman's tail and set it on fire, on which Hanuman burnt Lanka
 hanuman sita ke paas pahunche
 Sita gave her Chudamani and sent them away
 ve waapas samudr paar aakar sabhi vaanron se mili or sabhi waapas sugriv ke paas chale gayi
 Rama was very happy with Hanuman's work
 ram vaanron kii sena ke saath samudratat par pahunche
 On the other hand, Vibhishan explained to Ravana that he should not hate Rama, on which Ravana humiliated Vibhishan and drove him out of Lanka
 vibhishana ram ke sharan main aa gaya or ram ne use lanka kaa raja ghoshit kar diya
 Rama pleaded to give way to the sea
 vinati na maanane par ram ne krodh kiya or unke krodh se bhaybheet hokar samudr ne swayan aakar ram kii vinati karne ke pashchaat nal or nil ke dwaara pul banane kaa upaay bataaya
 By order of the brothers of apes Jambavan tap-nile bridge on the sea with the help of the army tied up
 shri ram ne shri rameshwar kii sthapana karke bhagwaan shankar kii puja kii or sena sahit samudr ke paar utar gayi
 Ram camped across the ocean
 pul bandha jane or ram ke samudr ke paar utar jane ke samachar se ravan man main atyant vyakul hua
 Ravana's arrogance did not go away even after Mandodari convinced him not to hate Rama
 idhar ram apni vanarasena ke saath subel parvat par nivas karne lage
 Angad went to Ravana in Lanka as Rama's messenger and gave him the message of Rama's asylum, but Ravana did not listen
 shaanti ke saare prayaas asafal ho jane par yuddh armbh ho gaya
 a fierce battle ensued between Laxman and Meghnad
 shaktibaan ke waar se lakshmana moorchhit ho gayi
 Hanuman brought Sushen Vaidya for his treatment and went to bring Sanjeevani
 guptchar se samachar milane par ravan ne hanuman ke kaary main baadha ke liye kaalanemi ko bheja jiskaa hanuman ne vadh kar diya
 Due to lack of identification of the medicine, Hanuman lifted the whole mountain and went back
 maarg main hanuman ko rakshas hone ke sandeh main bharat ne baan maar kar moorchhit kar diya parantu yatharth jaanane par apane baan par baitha kar waapas lanka bhej diya
 Seeing the delay in the arrival of medicine, Ram began to bleed
 sahi samay par hanuman aushadhi lekar aa gayi or sushen ke upachaar se lakshmana swasth ho gayi
 Ravana woke Kumbhakarna to battle
 kumbhkarna ne bhi ravan ko ram kii sharan main jane kii asafal mantranaa di
 In the war, Kumbhakarna attained supremacy at the hands of Rama
 lakshmana ne meghnad se yuddh karke uskaa vadh kar diya
 Many fierce wars took place between Rama and Ravana and in the end Ravana was killed by Rama
 vibhishana ko lanka kaa rajya saunp kar ram sita or lakshmana ke saath pushpakavimaan par chadh kar ayodhya ke liye prasthaan kiya
 Uttarkand is the epilogue to the Ram Katha
 sita, lakshmana or samast vanarasena ke saath ram ayodhya waapas pahunche
 There was a grand reception of Rama, joy spread among the people along with Bharata

 This village is famous for producing the most soldiers from any one village in the Indian Army, which is unchanged for nearly twenty years
 a branch of the Aravalli mountain range touches the areas of this village
 This village is situated near a hill of the same chain where geologists have confirmed the source of graphite

 At that time this woman had left here with her husband and the rest of the family, leaving Bamla
 These people had reached there after the incident of any murder
 Here he acquired permanent land and Chanda Grewal bought almost the entire village land for twenty rupees

 Although in its initial phase this village was only of the Gravals, but due to the association of the surrounding areas, there was a change in the population here
 Today, about ninety percent people in Jats are 'sangwan' and 'ahlawat' and about ten percent people belong to the 'grewal' gotra
 Some people of the village also live by building houses in their fields apart from the original village, due to which the main population of the village has declined

 But these people have seen a deep attachment to Bharti in the army

 Due to dry land, the water level is very low here
 One canal passes through the village which has been dry for about fifteen years
 Therefore, people here put underground water motors which are discharged into deep wells
 The depth of these wells is about two hundred feet
 The main crops here are millet, wheat, jowar and gram

 He had no respect for flattery like flattery
 yahi sunakar ek din ek yuvak unase milane unke dwaar tak aa pahunchaa
 The court was adorned with music and music was going on
 vah yuvak dwaar par raja kii anumati kaa intazaar karne laga
 That young man was very talented
 bahut saare shaasron kaa gyaata tha
 Had worked in several states
 spashtavaktaa hone ke kaaran uske ashrayadaataaon ko vah dhrist nazar aayaa, at: har jagah use naukari se nikaal diya gaya
 Even after eating so much food, there was no change in his nature and behavior
 vah dwaar par khadaa tha tabhi uske kaan main vaadan kaa swar padaa or vah badbadaaya- "mehfil main baithe hue log murkh hai
 Enjoying music, but have no knowledge of music
 sazindaa galat raag bajaae ja rahaa he, lekin koi bhi use manaa nahin kar rahaa he
 "his murmur was heard clearly by the gatekeeper
 uskaa cheharaa krodh se laal ho gaya
 He told him to comment carefully
 usne jab us yuvak ko kaha ki maharaj vikramaditya khud mehfil main baithe he or ve bahut bade kala parkhi he to yuvak ne uphaas kiya
 He told the gatekeeper that he could be an art lover, but not an art connoisseur, because Sajinde's faulty voice is not understood by him
 us yuvak ne yah bhi bataa diya ki vah sazindaa kis taraf baitha hua he
 Now the doorkeeper could not remain quiet
 usne us yuvak se kaha ki use rajdand milegaa, agar uski baat sach sabit nahin hui
 The young man asked him to find out the truth and said with great confidence that he is ready to face every punishment if this thing is not proved to be true
 dwarpal andar gaya tathaa raja ke kaanon tak yah baat pahaunchi
 Vikram immediately ordered that the young man be introduced in the court
 vikram ke saamne bhi us yuvak ne ek disha main ishaara karke kaha ki vahaan ek vadak kii oongali doshapurn he
 The fingers of all the players sitting on that side began to be inspected
 sachmuch ek vadak ke anguthe kaa upree bhaag kataa hua tha or usne us anguthe par patali khaal chadha rakhi thi
 The king became convinced of the music knowledge of that young man
 tab unhone us yuvak se uskaa parichay praapt kiya or apane darbar main uchit sammaan dekar rakh liya
 That young man was really very knowledgeable and penetrating art
 usne samay-samay par apni yogyata kaa parichay dekar raja kaa dil jeet liya
 One day a very beautiful dancer came entered the court
 uske nrity kaa aayojan hua or kuch hi kshanon main mehfil saj gai
 The young man also began to enjoy dancing and music sitting among the courtiers
 vah narttaki bahut hi sadha hua nrity prastut kar rahi thi or darshak mugdh hokar rasaswadan kar rahe the
 Not knowing where a bhangra came from and sat on his chest
 narttaki nrity nahin roak sakati thi or na hi apane haathon se bhanvare ko hataa sakati thi, kyonki bhangimaayen gadabad ho jaatin
 He pulled his breath inwardly and left it at full speed
 anayas nikle saans ke jhonke se bhanvara dar kar ud gaya
 No one could have felt this moment of incident, but the eyes of that young man saw everything
 vah "vaah! vaah!" karte uthaa or apane gale kii motiyon kii maala us narttaki ke gale main daal di
 All the courtiers were stunned
 anushaasanheenata kii paraakaashtha ho gai
 Any reward given by someone else in the court in the presence of the king was considered the greatest insult to the king
 vikram ko bhi yah pasand nahin aayaa or unhone us yuvak ko is dhristataa ke liye koi thos kaaran dene ko kaha
 Then the young man told the king the whole incident of bhangra
 usne kaha ki bina nrity kii ek bhai bhangima ko nasht kiye, lay taal ke saath saamanjasy rakhte hue is narttaki ne jis safaai se bhanvare ko udaaya vah puraskaar yogya cheshtaa thi
 No one else was noticed except him, so how would he get the award
 vikram ne narttaki se poocha to usne us yuvak kii baton kaa samarthan kiya
 Vikram's anger vanished and he praised both the dancer and that young man
 ab unki nazar main us yuvak kaa mahatv or bad gaya
 Whenever a solution was to be found, his words were listened carefully and his consultation was taken seriously
 ek baar darbar main buddhi or sanskaar par charchaa chhidi
 The courtiers said that the rites come from wisdom, but that young man did not agree with them
 uskaa kahana tha ki saare sanskaar vanshanugat hote hai
 When there was no consensus, Vikram thought of a solution
 unhone nagar se dur hatakar jangal main ek mahal banwaaya tathaa mahal main goongi or baheri naukaraaniyaan niyukt kin
 One by one, four newborn babies were released into the palace under the supervision of those maids
 unamem se ek unka, ek mahaamantri kaa, ek kotwaal kaa tathaa ek brahman kaa putr tha
 Twelve years later, when they were presented in all four courts, Vikram in turn asked them - "is it efficient?" The four gave different answers
 raja ke putr ne "sab kushal he" kaha jabaki mahaamantri ke putr ne sansar ko nashwar bataate hue kaha "aane vaale ko janaa he to kushalta kisi?" kotwaal ke putr ne kaha ki chor chori karte he or badanaami nirparaadh kii hoti he
 In such a situation, it's unfair to think about proficiency
 sabase ant main brahman putr kaa jawaab tha ki aayu jab din-ba-din ghatati jaati he to kushalta kisi
 After listening to the answers of the four, the truth of the words of that young man was revealed
 raja kaa putr nishcint bhav se sab kuch kushal maanata tha or mantri ke putr ne tarkpurna uttar diya
 Similarly, the son of Kotwal discussed the judicial system, while the Brahmin son gave a philosophical answer
 sab vanshanugat sanskaron ke kaaran hua
 Everyone was brought up in one environment, but everyone's views varied according to their values

 uski praarambhik shiksha apni mata kii dekharekh main hui thi, jo apane samay ke "pavitra maarg" naamak dharmik andolan se bahut prabhavit thi
 Therefore, at an early age, he was interested in righteous conduct, simple, well-organized and professional life
 16 varsh kii aayu main, "collegium fidericaanum" kii shiksha samaapt kar, vah konigsburg ke vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hua, jahaan chah varsh usne bhautikashastra, ganit, darshan evam dharamshastra kaa adhyayan kiya
 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree
 kintu uski vyaktigat samasyaon main koi parivartan na hua
 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work

 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas

 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers
