 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 This condition usually occurs more in the upper half of the cornea
 palkon ke bheetar khujali or dah hona, netron se pani nikalate rahanaa, prakaashasahyata or pidaa iske saadhaaran lakshan hai

 Use of antibiotic drugs in the eye, in the form of drops for injecting into the eye and as an ointment for application, which lasts for a long time
 penicillin se is rog main koi laabh nahin hota; haan, anya sankraman usase avashya nasht ho jate hai
 For this disease, Oromycin, Terra Mycin, Chloramycin etc
 are used a lot
 hamaare anubhav main salphacitamide or niomycin donon ko milakar prayog karne se santoshjanak parinaam hote hai
 The imide-mycetin, which is the sum of these two, should be applied four times a day, for six to eight weeks
 saath hi jal main boric acid, zinc or adrinaline ke ghol kii boonden netra main daalate rahanaa chahie

 is rog ke kaaran hamaare deshavaasiyon kii bahut badi sankhya janm bhar ke liye aankhon se haath dho baithti he
 It is estimated that 30 percent of individuals have the disease from gonococcus, 30 percent from staphylo or streptococcus, and the rest from bacillus and virus infections
 pichley das varshon main yah rog penicillin or salphonamide ke prayog ke kaaran bahut kam ho gaya he
 Within three days of birth, the eyes become swollen and thick white secretion starts coming out from the eyelids
 yadi yah srav chauthe din ke pashchaat nikle to samajhnaa chahie ki sankraman janm ke pashchaat hua he
 a drop of secretion from the inside of the eyelids, from a glass of purified glass to a glass slide, has to be examined by microscope after it is pigmented by spreading it on a glass slide
 kintu pariksha kaa parinaam jaanane tak chikitsa ko rokna uchit nahin he
 The therapy should be started immediately
 rog ko rokane ke liye janm ke pashchaat hi boric loshan se netron ko svachh karke unamem penicillin ke ek si
si

 The area between the two eyelids becomes blurred and white spots form on it, which are called bitot spots
 carnia main vran ho jaataa he jo aage chalakar vidaar main parivartit ho jaataa he

 aise bacchon kaa paalan-poshan praayah uttamtapurvak nahin hota, jiske kaaran ve anya rogon ke bhi shikaar ho jate hai or bahut adhik sankhya main apni jivan lila sheeghra samaapt kar dete hai
 Mucus should be inhaled by adding vitamin a or paroline to the eye
 carnia main vran ho jane par atropine daalana aavashyak he
 Simple treatment is very important to the patient
 doodh, makkhan, fal, shark-liver yaa kaad-liver tel dwaara rogi ko vitamin e prachur maatra main dena tathaa rog kii teevr avasthaaon main injection dwaara vitamin e ke 50,000 ekak rogi ke sharir main prati din yaa prati duusare din pahunchaana isaki mukhya chikitsa he
 If full treatment is started at the beginning of the disease, then there is a high chance of the patient getting rid of the disease
 hamaare desh main kusht uttar pradesh, bengal or madras main adhik hota he or abhi tak yah bhi andhata kaa ek vishesh kaaran tha
 But here due to the special events of diagnosis and treatment of the disease by the government, this disease has now reduced greatly and thus the number of blind persons due to leprosy has decreased
 kusht rog do prakaar kaa hota he
 One in which nerves are innervated
 doosraa vah jisamen charm ke neeche gulikaay yaa choti-choti gaanthen ban jaati hai
 Both types of disease can cause blindness
 pehle prakaar ke rog main saatvin yaa naveen naadee ke aakraant hone se upree palak kii peshiyon kii kriya nasht ho jaati he or palak band nahin hota
 This causes inflammation of the mucosa and cornea, then ulcers are formed
 unke updravon se andhata ho jaati he
 In the second type of disease, symptoms of inflammation appear in the mucosa and sclera
 bhunh ke bal gir jate hai or usamen gaanthen si ban jaati hai
 Similar points of white lime appear on the cornea
 panes bhi ban saktaa he
 Inflammation also occurs in the cornea and Iris is also infested
 iske kaaran vah apane saamne tathaa peeche ke avyavon se jud jaataa he
 Sulfones are specific drugs for leprosy
 shaareerik rog kii chikitsa ke liye inako purna maatra main dena aavashyak he
 Also, spatial treatment of eye disease is also necessary
 jahaan bhi carnia yaa yris aakraant hon vahaan atropone kii boondon yaa maraham kaa prayog karnaa atyant aavashyak he
 We also have to perform weapons when necessary
 is rog ke kaaran netron main anek prakaar ke updrav utpann ho jate hai, jinka parinaam andhata hoti he
 Following are the main conditions: - k
 intstatial kiratitis, B
 Sclerosing keratitis, ga
 yritis or irodosiclitis, D
 Syphilitic choroiditis, d
 siphilitic retinitis, Ch
 Syphilis of the vision nerve

 Bake with warm wet cloth; cartisone, ek prati shat kii boonden yaa 10 milligram cartisone kaa shleshmakala ke neeche injection; Atropine, 10 percent drops into the eye
 isko saadharantaya janata main beriberi ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 In 1930, the disease spread in Bengal as an epidemic and it was equally common for children, young, old, women, men
 is rog kaa ek vishesh updrav samalvaay tha
 In this disease, the dow inside the eye increases, and the field of vision decreases, even at some time it completely disappears and the person becomes blind
 ant main drushti-naadee-kshay bhi ho jaataa he
 Eyes are seen as normal from outside, but the person does not see anything
 rog hone par, naadeekshay ke purv, mahamarishoth kii saamaanya chikitsa ke atirikt carnia or shwetpatal ke sangam sthaan par ek chota chhed kar diya jaataa he
 This is called trifining
 isse netragolas ke purv koshth se dravya baahar nikalataa rahata he or shwetkala dwaara sokh liya jaataa he
 In this way, the pressure of the eye does not increase
 andhata kaa yah bhi bahut bada kaaran he
 In this disease, the pressure inside the eye increases and vision decreases
 yah rog do prakaar kaa hota he, praathmik or gaun 
 The primary can then be divided into two types, the feeder and the disambiguator
 sambharani prakaar kaa rog ugr athwa jeern rup main prarambh ho saktaa he
 Its special symptoms are eye pain, redness, watery secretions, visual impairment, shallow anterior eye and increased inner eye pressure
 adhiktar, ugr rup main pidaa or anya lakshanon ke teevr hone par hi rogi doctor kii salaah letaa he
 If the doctor is an expert in eye diseases, he recognizes the disease and conducts appropriate treatment, so that the patient is not blind
 kintu jeern rup main lakshanon ke teevr na hone ke kaaran rogi praayah doctor ko tab tak nahin dikhaata jab tak drushtikshay utpann nahin ho paata, parantu tab laabhprad chikitsa kii aashaa nahin rahati
 The attacks of this type of disease occur intermittently
 akramanon ke bich ke kaal main rog ke koi lakshan nahin rahete
 Only the shallowness of the forearm remains, which is not known to the patient
 isse rog ke nidaan main bahudhaa bhram ho jaataa he
 The second disease that causes confusion is cataract, which usually occurs in older age
 jeern praathmik samalvaay bhi isi avasthaa main hota he
 For this reason, gradually increasing blindness can be understood to be the result of cataract, although its real cause is usually in which there is no benefit from weapons
 vriddhavastha main drishtihraas hone par rogi kii pariksha saavdhaanee se karnaa aavashyak he

 Cardinal Richelu was a religious leader, feudal and diplomatic of France
 richalu ek yogya rajaneta tha jisamen europe ke itihaas par apni amit chhap chodi tathaa is kaaran rajnay ke kshetra main uskaa ek sammanneey sthaan he
 Armand de Richalu was born into a feudal family
 isane dharmik shiksha grahan kii thi tathaa ikkis varsh kii avasthaa main isaki niyukti bishap pad par hui
 Impressed by this, the State General had called it to the court of Marie de Madici and appointed it to the rank of Cardinal
 is vyakti main adbhut gun tha jiske sahare yah din par din unnati karata gaya
 At first he became the chief advisor to the Rajmata Madissi, later it became the principal advisor and pioneer of Louis XIII and ruled France realistically for the next 18 years
 1624 main richalu ne lui atharahawein se vaada kiya tha - ”main vaada karata hum ki aapaki khushi ke liye main apni puri kshamta evam shakti huganots ko tabah karne main, bade samanton kaa sammaan samaapt karne main, janata main kartavya-parayanata jaagrath karne main laga duungaa
 "to fulfill his promise, Richlu served the king and France with immense devotion
 baad main rajmata medici ne richalu kaa virodh armbh kiya evam richalu ne rajmata ko rajasatta se hataakar lagbhag banavaas dilaa diya tha
 As far as reality is concerned, Louis XIII never wanted Richelu wholeheartedly, but Richelu's country love and royalty were two qualities before which even the king could not separate him from his position
 vastav main usne france kaa chahunmukhi vikaas kiya tha
 Louis was the thirteenth luxury man and he could not bow to the regime with much reverence

 This person had a monopoly in every area of administration and all the policies of the state were determined by this person
 uski kshamta evam kartavyaparayanata se prabhavit hokar lui ne samast rajkeey satta isi vyakti ko saunp di thi
 This does not mean that if the king was weak, if the king was weak, he would not be able to support the cardinal against the whole court and the royal family
 na to richalu hi prasiddh tha or na hi raja use pasand karata tha phir bhi uski yogyata ke bal par raja uski samast nitiyon kaa apankh band karke samarthan karata tha
 Throughout his time Richlu paid extreme attention to two things
 pratham, samast desh par raja kii satta ko purnatasya nirankush banaaya jaye
 Secondly, the honor and splendor of France should be highest in the foreign region
 richalu kaa vichaar tha ki vaideshik kshetra main desh ko ucchtata pradaan karne ke liye janata ke hiton kaa balidaan kiya ja saktaa he

 tapavidyut vah vidyut he jo do asmaan dhaatuon ke taron kii sandhi ko garm karne par in taron ke paripath main pravaahit hone lagati he
 Seebeck first invented this fact in 1821 by heating the treaty of copper and bismuth wires
 uparyukt paripath main utpann vidyutvahak bal nune hota he or isaki tivrata nimnlikhit baton par nirbhar karti he- The cold ends of wires of dissimilar metals are attached to the potentiometer to measure the electromotive force
 yadi paripath main kisi duusari dhaatu kaa taar shreneebaddh kar diya jaae to tapavidyut prabhaavon main parivartan nahin hota
 If the magnitude of the Seebeck electromotive force and the temperature of a cold joint and the temperature of a joint is zero degrees C, then the relation between e and t is known in the following formula: jahaan a or b tapavidyut sthiraank hai or inkaa maan paripath ke taron kii dhaatu par nirbhar karata he
 The thermodynamic constants of metals are given in the following table: bismuth or taanbe kii sandhi ke liye e = 45 t + 0
25T^2 microvolt he
 At low temperature, k is approximately proportional, but if it is very high, the value of k increases
 lohe or taanbe kii sandhi kaa e = 158 t - 0
0285T2 microvolt he
 Maximum e = 2,000 microvolts when the temperature is t = 275 Celsius
 ucch taap par e kaa maan ghatane lagata he tathaa 5500 sein degree yah shunya ho jaataa he 5500 sein
 se adhik taap badhane par kii disha badal jaati he or vidyutdhara vipareet disha main pravaahit disha main pravaahit hone lagati he
 Thus the flow of electric current in the opposite direction when the temperature increases is called reversal of thermodynamic flow and 550 ° c reversal heat
 taanbe or bismuth kii sandhi main yah prabhaav nahin hota
 There is a change in the electronegative force of the power when the temperature of any two wires increases by 10 Celsius, which is called the thermal power
 vibhinn dhaatuon ke tapavidyut gunon kii tulana karne ke liye sis kaa ek taar tathaa doosraa us dhaatu kaa lete hai jiskaa tapavidyut kaa gun gyaat karnaa he
 Thermodynamic effects are more commonly used to measure temperature

 jab ek paripath main kai tapantar yugma hote hai or unki kramik sandhiyaan ekantarat: garm or thandi hoti hai to kul vidyudvahak bal paripath main lage hue sab tapantar yugmon ke vidyudvahak balon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 This fact is used in a device called a thermal beam, in which bismuth and etymony rods fall into the category

 The current generated in this device is measured by a galvanometer and is an index of the magnitude of radiation
 tapavidyut sanyojanon dwaara vyapaarik upyogita kii drushti se vidyut utpann karne ke anek prayaas kiye gaye hai, kintu jab ye prayaas aanshik rup se safal hue to gyaat hua ki inkaa vyapaarik mahatv naganya he
 There are two types of difficulties in generating electricity electrically by thermodynamic combination: theoretical and structural
 paryaapt vidyudvahak bal praapt karne ke liye bahut adhik sanyojanon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or anubhav se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki adhik sanshlisht taapapunj tikaoo nahin hota
 Even if this difficulty is overcome, theoretical reasons, which depend on thermodynamics, suggest that the efficiency of a heat exchanger that converts heat energy into electrical energy is never high
