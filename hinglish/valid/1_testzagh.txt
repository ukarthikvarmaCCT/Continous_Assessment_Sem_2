 Mother-in-law reported in 1887 that starch is produced in plants by ingesting CO2 and extracting o2 of green plants
 hare paudhon main hone vaali prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya paudhon evam anya jivit praaniyon ke liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kriya he
 In this process, plants convert sunlight energy into chemical energy and complex carbon compounds become carbohydrates from simple substances like CO2 water
 in carbohydrates dwaara hi manushya evam jivit praaniyon ko bhojan praapt hota he
 In this way, plants make food for the whole animal world by the process of photosynthesis
 carbohydrates protein evam vitamin aadi ko praapt karne ke liye vibhinn fasalein ugaai jaati hai tathaa in sab padaarthon kaa nirmaan prakaash sanshleshan dwaara hi hota he

 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbondioxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials

 1967 main aranon ne bataaya ki chloroplast main paayi jane vaali protein farrodoxin prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main mukhya kaary karti he
 It is recognized by all scientists in the modern era that in oxygenation, free oxygen comes from water
 aadhunik samay main anek prayogon ke aadhaar par yah siddh ho chukaa he ki prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya nimna do charnon main sampann hoti he
 In the first stage, the light process or the hill process or the photochemical process
 or duusare charan main andheri prakriya athwa blekaman prakriya yaa prakashahin prakriya
 In the process of photosynthesis, both processes take place after each other
 prakaash prakriya andheri prakriya kii upeksha adhik teji se hoti he
 Photosynthesis occurs in all chloroplast-containing cells of the plant
 arthath paudhe ke samast hare bhaagon main hoti he
 This action occurs especially in the mesophyll tissue of the leaves because the parenchyma cells of the mesophyll tissue of the leaves have a greater amount of chloroplast than other cells
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main jo prakriya prakaash kii upasthiti main hoti he use prakaash kriya ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This activity was studied by other scientists like Hill
 prakaash prakriyaaon ke samay andheri prakriyaayen seemaabaddh kaarak kaa kaary karti hai
 Lighting processes take place in two stages, photolysis and placement of hydrogen
 photolysis kii prakriya main prakaash chlorophyl ke anu dwaara photone ke rup main avashoshit kii jaati he
 When the chlorophyll molecule absorbs one quantum of light, the second molecule of chlorophyll does not absorb the light until the first energy is used in the process of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl dwaara is prakaar shoshit prakaash kaa photone ucch urja str par ek electron nikaalati he tathaa yah shakti phosphate ke tisare band par sthit hokar ucch urja vaale adinosine tryphosphate ke rup main prakat hote hai
 Thus Chloropil produces ATP in the presence of light and this process is called phosphorylation
 is prakaar surya ke prakaash kii urja atipi arthath rasinic urja main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Thus, the ATP produced in the chlorophyll molecule is helpful in many chemical reactions such as CO2 being deoxidized into sugars, separated from the chlorophyll molecule
 chlorophyl is atipi ko swatantra karne par phir akriy ho jaataa he
 According to Van Neil Frank, Wishnik, when water comes into contact with this functional chlorophyll, the water is dissected in unoxidized h and strong oxidizing OH
 chlorophyl + prakaash → sakriy chlorophiliah2o + sakriy chlorophyl → H+ + oh-is photolysis prakriya main O2 pani se swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen bhi hydrogen graahak par chali jaati he
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 Thus all the oxygen released from the photosynthetic activities of plants is derived from water
 hill, ruben ne iskaa samarthan kiya tathaa O18 kaa prayog karke isko siddh kiya
 The release of oxygen from water was shown to be in the absence of CO2 in an algae called chlorilla
 iskaa arth hua ki CO2 kii anupasthiti main oxygen kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he, parantu isamen hydrogen graahak hona chahie
 It has been observed that NADP forms two NADPH2 in plants
 2H2O+2NADP=2NADPH2+O2 According to Aranan, light action is mainly related to construction
 NADPH2 / NADP ke avkaran se banataa he
 NADP is also known as TPN
 atipi ek prakaash urja anu he jo edipi main ek phosphate group ke judane se banataa he tathaa is kriya ko phosforilation kehete hai
 Phosphorylation of ADP requires light energy, so it is also called photo-phosphorylation
 yah bhi ek jatil kriya he tathaa aranan ke anusaar prakaash prakriya do prakramon main hoti he
 Combination photo-phosphorylation and Pair photo-phosphorylation In the photo-phosphorylation, electrons are continuously obtained due to the decomposition of water and ATP is produced by light energy in chlorophyll on the action of photo-phosphorylation
 is prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ke sakriy hone par pheredoxin electron grahi kaa kaary karti he jise enedipi naamak coenzyme ko detaa he jisamen enedy pani dwaara mukt kii gai hydrogen ko pakad kar NADPH2 main parivartit ho jaataa he
 In this way, the free electrons dissolved in water are excited at chlorophyll 'b' and reach a higher energy level, and these electrons are again obtained by the type chlorophyll 'a', it is not fully known but it is believed That the electron receptor called plastokavinone captures these electrons which then revert to chlorophyll 'a' by the cytochrome
 isamen saath-saath atipi kaa bhi nirmaan hota he
 In the process of pair photo-phosphorylation, chlorophyll 'a' is activated by sunlight and throws electrons out which are captured by the ferridoxine present in chlorophyll
 yahi electron mukt hokar plastoquinon naamak electron grahi dwaara pakad liya jaataa he
 In the middle of this action, ADP is converted to ATP and the electron is released again and goes back to the chlorophyll 'a' via the cytochrome wicker
 is kriya main bhi edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he
 External electrons are not used in this activity and the electron comes out of chlorophyll and comes back there again
 is prakaar ayugma va yugma prakriyaaon dwaara pani vighatit ho jaataa he jisase oxigen gas swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen, hydrogen grahi enedipi dwaara pakad lee jaati he tathaa saath hi saath urja bhi vargeekrut ho jaati he jiskaa prayog rasinic prakriya yaa aprakashiya pratikriya main hota he
 Oxygen and photosynthesis is prakriya ke liye prakaash kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Carbon dioxide is often degraded in this process
 is prakriya main pattee ke stomata dwaara grahan kii gai carbondioxide, pani se nikali hydrogen prakaash kii urja ke kaaran milakar ek sthaayee dravya banaata he
 CH2O, it is a unit molecule of carbohydrates
 kelvin va banson ne radio isotopic takanic kaa prayog kar bataaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii prakriya main pehla sthai yogic ek 3 carbon vaala 3-phosphoglicerick amla banataa he
 Photosynthesis was carried out briefly in the presence of radioactive C14O2 in algae called Chlorolla and Syndesmus, and these also formed the first stable liquid phosphoglyceric acid
 yah phosphoglicerick amla baad main glucose banaata he
 Thus it was proved by the work of Calvin and his colleagues that CO2 is converted into glucose in the photosynthesis process
 unhone is prayog main carbon ke samasthanik kaa prayog kiya
 Chlorophyll contains ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 ab vayumandaleey CO2 pattee ke stomata dwaara pravesh kar andar pahunchati he tathaa turant hi ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate ke saath milakar ek asthai yogic kaa nirmaan kati he
 The temporary compound thus formed, which is 5-carbon sugar, soon breaks down into 2 molecules of phosphoglyceric acid
 ab yahaan par NADPH2 dwaara hydrogen mukt kiye jane par pijie ko pijieel main parivartit kar detaa he
 Energy is obtained from ATP in this activity
 is prakaar CO2 se carbohydrates nirmaan ho jate hai
 In the dark process of photosynthesis, plants in which the first permanent compound phosphoglyceric acid is formed are called C3 plant
 phosphoglissrik amla ek 3 carbon vaala yogic he isliye in paudhon kaa aisa namakaran he
 The plants in which the first permanent compound forms a compound of 4 carbons are called C4 plants
 saadharantah 4 carbon vaala yogic oxaloecetic amla banataa he
 It was previously believed that only C3 or Calvin cycle occurred during the stabilization or fixation of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, that is, the first stable compound is phosphoglyceric acid
 lekin 1966 main hech evam slack ne bataaya ki carbondioxide ke sthirikaran kaa ek doosraa path bhi he
 He studied in sugarcane, maize, amaranthus, etc
 that phosphoinol pyruvic acid, which is a 3-carbon specific compound, combines with carbon dioxide to form 4-carbon-specific compound oxaloacetic acid
 is kriya main phosphoinol piruveet carboxillage injim utprerak kaa kaary karata he
 There are four main components in the process of photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, light and foliage
 in chaaron kii upasthiti is kriya ke liye ati aavashyak he
 Of these, water and carbon dioxide are called raw materials for photosynthesis because the main products of photosynthesis are the formation of carbohydrates by their creative ingredients
 in avyavo ko paudha apane aas-paas ke vaataavaran se grahan karata he
 Carbon dioxide is a major component and raw material of photosynthesis
 vayumandal main carbondioxide gas shwasan, dahan, kinvan, vighatan aadi kriyaaon ke dwaara mukt hoti he
 Its volume in air is 0
03% to 0
04%
 sthaliy paudhe ise sidhe hi vaayu se grahan kar lete hai
 The leaves of these plants have small holes called parnandhra
 carbondioxide inhen parnarandhron se paudhe kii pattiyon main pravesh karti he
 Submerged plants ingest carbon dioxide dissolved in water by diffusing it from their physical surface
 jal main carbondioxide kaa strot jaleey jantu hai, jinke shwasan main yah gas utpann hoti he
 The decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate present in the underwater rocks also produces carbon dioxide which aquatic plants consume in photosynthesis
 prakaash-sanshleshan main glucose naamak carbohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he
 In this, carbon and oxygen atoms are obtained from carbon dioxide
 chlorophyl chlorophyl ek proteinous jatil rasinic yogic he
 It is the main pigment of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl e tathaa chlorophyl bi do prakaar kaa hota he
 It is found in chloroplasts of all autotrophic green plants
 chlorophyl ke anu surya ke prakaashiya urja ko avashoshit kar use rasinic urja main roopaantarit karte hai
 Chlorophyll molecules are excited by absorbing the Sun's optical energy
 ye sakriy anu jal ke anuon ko H+ tathaa OH- aayan main vighatit kar dete hai
 Thus chlorophyll molecules initiate the biochemical activity of photosynthesis
 prakaash surya kaa prakaash prakaash-sanshleshan ke liye aavashyak he
 Photosynthesis also takes place in the intense artificial light of bulbs etc
 laal rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 This action is most common in red after purple
 ye donon rang chlorophyl dwaara sarvaadhik adhik maatra main avashoshit kiye jate hai
 The green color reflects chlorophyll completely, so photosynthesis stops completely in every color
 jal jal prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya kaa kaccha maal he
 Terrestrial plants absorb it from soil by root roots
 jaleey paudhe apane jal ke sampark vaale bhaagon kii bahya sataha se jal kaa avasorana karte hai
 Uprooting plants such as orchids absorb atmospheric water vapor through their pneumatic roots
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke prakaashiya abhikriya main jal ke prakaashiya vighatan se oxigen utpann hota he
 This oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct
 adheri abhikriya main banane vaali glucose ke anuon main hydrogen tatv ke anu jal se hi praapt hote hai
 Water also performs indirect functions during photosynthesis
 yah jeevadravya kii kriyasheeltaa tathaa injime kii sakriyata ko banaae rakhata he
 Photosynthesis is affected by many factors
 iske kuch kaarak bahya hote hai tathaa kuch aantarik
 Additionally there are some limiting factors
 bahya kaaran ve hote he jo prakruti or paryaavaran main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan ko prabhavit karte hai jaise prakaash, chunki surya ke prakaash se paudha is kriya ke liye urja praapt karata he tathaa andhere se yah kriya sambhav hi nahin he
 Carbon dioxide, because it has been observed that if all other factors are obtained in the highest amount by the plant and the amount of CO2 is gradually increased in the atmosphere, the rate of photosynthesis also increases
 taapmaana, kyo ki dekha gaya he ki paudhon main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ke liye ek nishchit tapakram kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tathaa jal, pani photochemical prakriyaaon ke atyant aavashyak he or yah is kriya ke samay anek rasinic parivartanon main sahyog karata he
 Internal causes are those that affect the action of photosynthesis by being located in the leaves, such as foliage or chlorophyll by which light energy is converted into chemical energy
 praras / jeevadravya / puras yaa protoplasm jisamen paae jane vaale vikar prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai
 The deposition of food, because if the food produced in the process of photosynthesis continues to accumulate in the local cells, the rate of photosynthesis slows down
 pattiyon kii aantarik sanrachana kyon ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar pattiyon main upasthit stomata yaa randhron kii sankhya tathaa unke band evam khulne ke samay par nirbhar karti he
 Age of leaves, as new leaves have higher rates of photosynthesis of older leaves
 iske atirikt prakaash sanshleshan ko in sabhi vastuon kii alag-alag gati bhi prabhavit karti he
 When an action of photosynthesis is controlled by various factors, the speed of photosynthesis is controlled by the slowest factor
 prakaash, carbondioxide, jal, chlorophyl ityadi main se jo bhi uchit pariman se kam pariman main hota he, vah puri kriya kii gati ko niyantrit rakhata he
 This factor is called time-bounded factor

 Mechanism of Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is a very complex process, which is mainly carried out in two terms - 1 optical reaction and 2 unpublished reactions, 1
 Optical Reaction - In order to harness the energy of sunlight and to make hydrogen available by the dispersion of water, these activities take place in the presence of light in the particles called grana inside the green lantern
 in kanon main parnaharim yaa chlorophyl naamak padaarth hota he
 These actions can be summarized as follows: The radiation energy of sunlight activates the chlorophyll molecules and expels the energetically excited electrons
 sakriy chlorophyl se aavashyak urja praapt kar jal ke anuon kaa vichchhedan hota he jisase hydrogen tathaa anxigen praapt hoti he|agar aapako bhi ganit lagati he acchhee to aapkaa bhavishya he ujjwal, jane kaise? uttejit elevatron ek vishesh tantra, jise elevatron sthaanantaran tantra kehete he, ke dwaara apni urja de dete he
 This energy is stored in ADP molecules by leaving a phosphate group and leaving

 Unpublished Reaction - Light is not required for these actions
 in abhikriyaaon ko inaki khoj karne vaale vaigyanik ke naam ke aadhaar par bluecoman abhikriyaayein kehete hai
 These actions take place in the pelvic or stroma of the larynx
 in samast kriyaaon ko, jo ek vishesh padaarth ribulos biphosphate kii upasthiti main ek chakra ke rup main hoti he, calvin chakra bhi kehete hai
 In a nutshell, these reactions can be expressed as follows: In the presence of certain substances, CO 2 obtained from the atmosphere is degraded from h + of NADP
H 2 obtained from optical activity and forms a substance called PGAL
 in kriyaao main agralikhit abhikriyaayein sammilit he- 5 carbon vaale yogic rubp ke saath carbon dianksaide ke anu milakar ek 6 carbon asthaayee yogic kaa nirmaan karte he- yah asthaayee yogic sheeghra hi apachayit hokar va tuutakar do anu PGA bana letaa he
 It is a three-carbon compound - PGA molecules subsequently become more reduced, forming PGAL
 PGAL ke do anu milakar tathaa apchayan ke dwaara phosphate sharkara kaa tathaa baad main sharkara kaa nirmaan kar lete hai
 PGAL itself can also act like food
 yah teen carbon parmaanu vaala yogic he
 Its two molecules combine to form one molecule of glucose
 glucose se hi anya sabhi prakaar ke bhojya padaarthon, jaise - protein, vasa, mand ityadi kaa nirmaan bhi paudhe ke andar hi ho jaataa he
 In the Calvin cycle, PGAL and its products also regenerate ribulose biphosphate, which means that it is remodeled to run the reactions of the cycle

 kabir panth naamak dharmik sampradaay inaki shikshaaon ke anuyaayi hai
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars about the place of birth, but most scholars consider their birth in Kashi only, which also confirms this statement of Kabir himself
 kabir ke guru ke sambandh main prachlit kathan he ki kabir ko upyukt guru kii talash thi
 He wanted to make Vaishnava saint Acharya Ramanand his master but he refused to make Kabir a disciple but Kabir decided in his mind to make Swami Ramananda his master at all costs, for this, a thought in Kabir's mind He came that Swami Ramanand ji goes to bathe in the Ganges at four o'clock in the morning before he will lie down the stairs on his way and he did so
 ek din, ek pahar raat rahete hi kabir panchganga ghat kii sidhiyon par gir pade
 Ramanand ji was descending the stairs to perform Gangesan, when his foot fell on Kabir's body
 unke mukh se tatkaal 'ram-ram' shabd nikal padaa

 Even today the tomb and mausoleum are located there

 Kabir was not educated - 'don't touch my paper, i don't touch a pen
 'unhone swayan granth nahin likhe, munh se bhakhe or unke shishyon ne use likh liya
 The glory of Ramnama is echoed in all your thoughts
 ve ek hi ishwar ko maanate the or karmkand ke ghor virdohi the

 Kabir's Rama is unknowable and resides in every particle of the world
 kabir ke ram islam ke akeshwarwadi, eksattavadi khuda bhi nahin hai
 In Islam, Khuda or Allah is believed to be different from entire world and creatures and supremely capable
 par kabir ke ram param samarth bhale hon, lekin samast jeevon or jagat se bhinn to kadaapi nahin hai
 Rather, on the contrary, they are the prevalent Ramta Ram
 vah kehete hainvyapak brahm sabanimain ekai, ko pandit ko jogi
 ravana-rao Kavansun Kavan Veda
 kabir ram kii kisi khaas roopakriti kii kalpana nahin karte, kyonki roopakriti kii kalpana karte hi ram kisi khaas dhaanche main bandh jate, jo kabir ko kisi bhi haalat main manjuur nahin
 Kabir wanted to give a different and broader form to the concept of Ram
 iske kuch vishesh kaaran the, jinaki charchaa ham is lekh main aage karenge
 But despite this, Kabir definitely establishes a personal family type relationship with Ram
 ram ke saath unka prem unki alokik or mahimashali satta ko ek kshan bhi bhulaae bagaiyr sahaj premparak maanviya sambandhon ke dharaatal par pratishthit he
 Kabir believes in the name, not the form
 haalaanki bhakthi-samvednaa ke siddhanton main yah baat saamaanya rup se pratishthit he ki ‘naam rup se badhkar he’, lekin kabir ne is saamaanya siddhant kaa kranthidharmee upyog kiya
 Kabir, with the name Ram, gave a sublime and comprehensive look to the centuries-old synthetic sentiments created in Lokmanya and tried to prevent him from being tied to the mythology-propounded Brahminical ideology
 kabir ke ram nirgun-sagun ke bhed se pare hai
 In fact, he used the word 'nirgun Rama' - 'nirgun Rama Japahu Re Bhai' to separate his Rama from Rastra, the patron of the scripturally-rendered Avatari, Saguna, dominant Varnashrama system
 ’ is ‘nirgun’ shabd ko lekar bhram main padane kii jarurat nahin
 Kabir means just this word that God cannot be bound within the boundaries of any name, form, quality, time etc
 jo sari simaaon se pare hai or phir bhi sarvatra hai, vahi kabir ke nirgun ram hai
 He named it 'ramta Ram'
 apane ram ko nirgun visheshan dene ke baavjood kabir unke saath maanviya prem sambandhon kii tarah ke rishte kii baat karte hai
 Sometimes he considers Rama as his lover or husband, and sometimes he is a lord in the sense of bondage
 kabhi-kabhi vah ram ko vatsalya murti ke rup main maan maan lete hai or khud ko unka putr
 This kind of succulent, spontaneous, human love is unique to Kabir's devotion even with the nirgun-formless Brahm
 yah duvidha or samasya dusron ko bhale ho sakati he ki jis ram ke saath kabir itane anany, maanviya sambandhparak prem karte hon, vah bhala nirgun kaise ho sakate hai, par khud kabir ke liye yah samasya nahin he
 He also says, "santou, tell me cheating
 gunamem nirgun, nirgunamem gun, baat chhandi kyun bahise!”nahin he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while expressing his views regarding Kabir's spiritual practice of Ram and Kabir, said: "kabir's entire life was spent in the search for truth and refutation of the truth
 kabir kii sadhana ‘‘maanane se nahin, ‘‘jaanane se armbh hoti he
 He is not a disciple of anyone, but a disciple warned by Ramanand
 unke liye ram rup nahin he, dasharathi ram nahin he, unke ram to naam sadhana ke pratik hai
 His Rama is not imprisoned within the boundaries of any sect, caste or country
 prakruti ke kan-kan main, ang-ang main raman karne par bhi jise anang sparsh nahin kar saktaa, ve alakh, avinashi, param tatv hi ram hai
 His Rama is not a discriminator between man and man
 ve to prem tatv ke pratik hai
 Rising above the sense of love or worship are: ‘prem jagaavai virah ko, virah jagaavai piu, piu jagaavai jeev ko, joi piu soi jiu' - jo piu he, vahi jeev he
 That is why his whole practice is the practice of "hans Ubaran Aaya"
 is hans kaa ubaarana pothiyon ke padhane se nahin ho saktaa, dhai aakhar prem ke aacharan se hi ho saktaa he
 Religion is not a matter of wear and tear, it is a continuous practice of conduct in life
 unki sadhana prem se armbh hoti he
 Love it so deeply that God becomes divine for you
 usko paane kii itani utkantha ho jaae ki sabase vairaygy ho jaae, virah bhav ho jaae tabhi us dhyaan samadhi main piu jaagrath ho saktaa he
 That same Pew can awaken a creature sitting in your heart
 joi piu he soi jiu he
 Then you will love the world, the world will become an object of your love for each organism
 sara ahankaar, sara dwesh dur ho jayega
 Then great spirit will arise
 isi mahabhaav se puraa sansar piu kaa ghar ho jaataa he
