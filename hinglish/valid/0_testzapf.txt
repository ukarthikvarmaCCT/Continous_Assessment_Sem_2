 It is located in the Nilam district of the Shigatse Department of Tibet and is 5 km from the Nepal border
 tibet par china kaa niyantran he or china ne use bahari vishwa se bahut der tak band rakhaa tha jis karanvash yah vishwa kaa antim aath hazari parvat tha jise maanvon dwaara chadha gaya
 Shishapangama is the 14th highest mountain in the world and is located in a part of the Himalayas called Jugal Himal which is sometimes considered part of the Longtang Himal
 tibeti bhashaa main "pangama" kaa arth "marg" or "shisha" yaa "chisa" kaa arth "parvatashrenee" he, yani "shishapangma" kaa arth "marg ke upar khadaa parvat" he
 The substances that are required to survive, and for their growth, are called nostrils or culture media
 ye padaarth prakritik yaa kritrim ho sakate hai
 Serum is a natural nutritional substance

 The study of the history of language words is called etymology
 isamen vichaar kiya jaataa he ki koi shabd us bhashaa main kab or kaise pravisht hua; kis strot se athwa kahan se aayaa; uskaa swaroop or arth samay ke saath kis tarah parivartit hua he
 In etymology, the language, cultural, historical and social background of any nation, province and society is expressed through the history of the word
 'vyutpatti' kaa arth he ‘vishesh utpatti’
 Studying the chronological history of a word is a matter of etymology
 isamen shabd ke swaroop or uske arth ke aadhaar kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Etymology in English is called 'etymology'
 yah shabd unani bhashaa ke yatharth arth main prayukt Etum tathaa lekha-jokha ke arth main prayukt Logos ke yoga se bana he, jiskaa aashay shabd ke itihaas kaa vaastavik arth sampusht karnaa he
 The origins of etymology are very ancient in India
 jab veda mantron ke arthon ko samajhnaa sugam nahin rahaa tab bhartiya manishiyon dwaara vedon ke clisht shabdon ke sangrah rup main nighantu granth likhe gaye tathaa nighantu granthon ke shabdon kii vyakhya or shabd vyutpatti ke gyaan ke liye nirukt granthon kii rachana hui
 The six scriptures of the Vedagas include Nirukta Shastra for the study of Vedas
 nirukt shaastra sankhya main 12 batalaaye jate hai, lekin is samay acharya yask pranit ek maatr nirukt uplabdh he
 The credit for the first in-depth analysis of the origin of words in the world goes to the Sanskrit grammars of India who first interpreted and interpreted Vedic words under the name Nirukta
 sanskrit ke chaar vaiyaakaran sabase prasiddh hai: The etymology of Sanskrit words refers to the works of the above grammars

 Explosives are some compounds or mixtures in which they erupt with a big bang when set on fire or strike
 dhamaake kaa kaaran bade alp kaal main bahut badi maatra main gaison kaa bananaa hota he
 Such substances are called "explosives"
 aaj bahut badi maatra main visphotakon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Explosives have two purposes: shaantikaal main unase chattaanon ko udaaya or koyale or anya khanijon ko kam kharch main khaanon se nikaala jaataa he tathaa During the war, enemies are protected from harm by explosions
 jis teen mile lambii surang ke banane main teen hajaar vyakti 11 varshon tak kaam main lage the, vahi surang aadhunik mashiinon or visphotakon kii sahaayta se keval 100 vyaktiyon dwaara das maas main ban sakati he
 Explosives are a mixture of chemical substances, which are detonated due to the formation of a large amount of gas with the hammer being hit or touched by a flame, or the sudden heat produced by electrically blasting
 yadi kisi band kaksh main visphoton ho, to kaksh kii deevaaren chhin bhinn ho jaati he
 But beneficial explosives are essentially inert, so that their manufacture and transport are safe
 kuch visphotak aise hote hai ki pankh se chune par bhi ve visphutit ho jate hai
 Such explosives are of no useful use
 upyogi visphotakon main kuch ucch visphotak hote hai or kuch saamaanya yaa mand visphotak
 This distinction is not made on the basis of their sensitivity, but on their ability to differentiate
 kuch visphotak, jaise mercury falminute tathaa lead azid, jo bade sugrahi hote hai, praathmik visphotak ke rup main nune sugrahi visphotak ke visphoton main upyukt hote hai
 Some of the major explosives are: 1
 dynamite -- teevr visphotak, shaantikaal ke liye 2
 Explosive Gelatin - For intense explosive, peacetime 3
 tianti -- teevr visphotak, yuddh ke liye 4
 Picric acid - for intense explosive warfare 5
 ammonium nitrate -- teevr visphotak yuddh ke liye 6
 Smokeless powder - Dim explosive, for war 7
 kalachurna yaa barood -- mand visphotak, shanti or yuddh donon ke liye 8
 Mercury Falminet --- Auxiliary explosive, for warfare 9
 lead azid --- sahaayak visphotak, yuddh ke liye Nitroglycerin is used in the manufacture of dynamite
 nitroglisreen aavashyaktaa se adhik sugrahi hota he
 Keyslagar is used to reduce its sensitivity
 america main kizalgar ke sthaan main kaath chura, yaa kaath samita or sodium nitrate kaa upyog hota he
 The amount of nitroglycerin in dynamite is 20, 40, or 60 75 per cent
 isaki prabalata nitroglisreen kii maatra par nirbhar karti he
 Dynamite with 75 percent nitroglycerin is predominant
 kizalgar, yaa kashthachurna, yaa samita ke prayog kaa uddeshy dynamite kaa sangrakshan hota he, taaki yatayaat main vah visphutit na ho jaae
 Nitroglycerin 13 ° c But freezes jam jane par yah visphutit nahin hota
 Therefore, to avoid it becoming useless in frosty climate, 20 parts glycerin dinitromonoclo-rhhydrin is added to it
 yah jamaavarodhikarak kaa kaam karata he
 This allows nitroglycerin-30 ° C
 Till the fluid remains
 nitroglisreen ke sthaan main nitroglykol kaa upyog ab hone laga he
 Explosive gelatin contains 90 percent glycerin and 10 percent nitrocellulose
 tii en tii trinitrotolvin he
 It is 81 degrees Celsius But melts
 di en tii ke saath ammonium nitrate ke mili rahane se tii en tii adhik prabal visphotak ho jaataa he
 Picric acid is explosive
 phenol ke nitretikaran se yah banataa he
 It is a yellow solid, 121 ° C
 But melts
 iskaa sis lavan picrik amla se 5 guna adhik sugrahi hota he
 The picric acid itself is filled in the shell
 ammonium nitrate tii en tii ke saath milakar prayukt hota he
 It also acts as an oxidizer
 swayan yah kathinata se prasphotin hota he
 Nitrocellulose is present in smokeless powder
 yah asitone se geletinikrut kiya rahata he
 Small amounts of diphenylamine and urea are used as stabilizers
 visphotakon kii kshamta do baton, prasphot kii tivrata or prasphot ke sanchaaran ke veg par nirbhar karti he
 The ability to discolor is based on both of these properties
 tivrata gaison or ooshmaa ke unmukt hone par nirbhar karti he
 For this, a known load of explosive is detonated by placing it in the cavity of the siphon
 isse sis nipind kii guha kaa uttanan ho jaataa he
 The volume of a cavity is a measure of the intensity of an explosive
 ek duusari vidhi main 500 pound morter ko lolak ke rup main latakaate he or usase 36 pound kaa gola chhodte hai
 This causes the mortar to rebound
 morter kaa yahi pratikshep prabalata kii maap he
 Both methods often yield only one result
 kathor chattaanon ko udaane ke liye prabal or ucch vegavaale visphotakon kii aavashyaktaa padati he or kam kathor chattaanon ke liye kam prabal or mand veg vaale visphotakon se kaam chal jaataa he
 One feature of the importance of explosives is its sensitivity
 sugrahita kaa pareekshan visphotak par bhaar giraakar kiya jaataa he
 The higher it falls from higher altitude, the less sensitive it is
 jo visphotak koyale kii khaanon main vyavahrut hote hai, unka pareekshan ek vishesh prakaar se hota he, kyoking koyale kii khaanon main jvalansheel gaisen rah sakati hai
 Explosives that do not erupt in such gases are used in mines
 aise visphotakon kii jwaala choti or alpakaalik hoti he
 The length and duration of the flame are measured by photography
 barood kii samyavadhi 0
077 second or jwaala kii lambaai 110 mimi
 tathaa gancoton kii samyavadhi 0
0013 second or jwaala kii lambaai 97 mimi
 hoti he
 The duration and flame length of picric acid ammonium nitrate are much shorter than this
 gancoton kii topakaksh main visphutit karne se prati varg inch lagbhag 3 ton kaa dabaav utpann hota he
 There are two types of explosives used in war: pranodak, jo kaartuson main bhare jate hai, tathaa Those which are filled in a round shell
 rifl ke kaartoos main bhi ek pranodak or duusari bullate yaa goli ja yashad-tamra mishradhatu kii bani hoti he, sis ke nichol main rakhi hoti he
 Tankmar rifles have steel bullets
 hathgole main koi pranodak nahin hota
 Nitrocellulose in the form of fiber is highly explosive, but after being gelatinized becomes dim explosive
 akele yaa anya padaarthon ke saath milakar, yahi pradhanthya mand visphotak ke rup main vyavahrut hoti he
 The pill shell contains TNT, or ametol, picric acid, or its salts
 iskaa kaam hota he nidisht sthaan par pahunchakar, tivrgami tukdon main chur chur ho janaa or vaastavik missile yaa astr ban janaa
 The shell holds a ball tied to rosin or ammo
 aise khol ko "shrepnel shell" kehete hai
 Battle gas may also remain in place of the ball
 khol ko palite dwaara jalaayaa jaataa he
 The shell is made of steel
 bahudhaa usamen aluminium kii naaknuma dhar lagi rahati he
 Nitrogen is 12
8 percent of the nitrocellulose used in explosives
 rakhane par dhoomahin churna kaa hraas hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to keep testing it periodically
 cordit main nitrocelulose or nitroglisreen donon rahete hai
 Their relative quantity is not fixed
 ek cordit main nitrocelulose 65 bhaag, nitroglisreen 30 bhaag or khanij jelly 0
5 bhaag rahete hai
 a second chordite contains nitrocellulose 37 parts, nitroglycerin 58 parts and jelly 0
5 parts
 asitone geletinikarak ke rup main prayukt hota he
 Potassium chlorate, potassium paralorate, nitrogenidine, mercury fulminate, lead azih, nitro starch, liquid oxygen, and wood coal are also used as explosives
 twarit karrwai bal kaa gathan 1992 main bharat sarkaar dwaara sampradayikta ke badhate hue khatre se nibatane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It was formed to deal with the riots sympathetically and expertly
 yah prakritik aapadaaon ke samay bhi naagarik prashasan kii madad karata he
 Chaukhuta is a village in the Nainital district of the Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Dhari tehsil
 suran kul paudhon kaa ek bada kul he jisamen lagbhag 100 vansh tathaa 1900 spishij sammilit hai
 They are found in parts of the world to temperate regions
 is kul ke kuch sadsy jaleey hote hai, jaise pistia jalgobhi, kuch paudhon ke tane urdhv yaa arohi hote hai, jaise monstera tathaa kuch anya sadasyon main bhumigat kand athwa prakand, jaise amorfofalas evam colokesia hote hai
 Ascending vines are found exclusively in tropical rain forests
 paudhe adhikanshat: shaakeey hote hai jinamein jaleey yaa dugdhras paaya jaataa he
 The leaves of some species in the tropical region of Malaya and Africa have long leaves and these species produce highly flowering spaths
 is spethon se badi apriy durgandh nikalati he
 Pollination in these plants is done by scavenger flies
 phool chote tathaa ubhayalingi yaa ubhay lingashrayi hote hai
 The flowers continue on the spike, called the spedix
 spedics hare, jaise eram main, athwa chamakdaar rang ke, jaise athurium main, speth se ghira hota he
 Serpent plants, such as those found on the Erisima hills, are important for Monstera deliciosa fruits, Amorphophallus, ie, suran and erum, produce "edible rhizome" lords and ladies
 pothos sajaavati arohi lata he or inthurium green house kaa gamale main lagaaya jane vaala aakarshak paudha he
 The lunar eclipse is that astronomical position when the moon comes into its shadow just behind the Earth
 aisa tabhi ho saktaa he jab surya, prithvi or chandramaa is kram main lagbhag ek sidhi rekha main avasthit hon
 Due to this geometric restriction, the lunar eclipse can only occur on the full moon
 chandragrahan kaa prakaar evam avadhi chandra aasandhiyon ke saapeksh chandramaa kii sthiti par nirbhar karte hai
 This form of the moon is also called 'blood moon'
 chandra grahan shuru hone ke baad ye pehle kaale or phir dhire-dhire surkh laal rang main tabdeel hota he
 Unlike any solar eclipse, which is visible only from a relatively small part of the Earth, the lunar eclipse can be seen from any part of the Earth's night side
 jahaan chandramaa kii chaaya kii laghutaa ke kaaran suryagrahan kisi bhi sthaan se keval kuch minuton tak hi dikhataa he, vahiin chandragrahan kii avadhi kuch ghanton kii hoti he
 Additionally, lunar eclipses can be seen, unlike solar eclipses, without any special protection for the eyes, as the brightness of the lunar eclipse is less than that of the full moon
 hindi kahani hindi sahitya kii pramukh kathatmak vidha he
 The modern Hindi story began in the 20th century
 pichley ek sadi main hindi kahani ne adarshavaad, yatharthwaad, pragativaad, manovishleshanvaad, aanchalikta, aadi ke daur se guzarate hue sudeergh yatra main anek uplabdhiyaan hasil kii he
 Story collections like Nirmal Verma's Day of the Day have also been awarded to Sahitya Akademi
 premchand, janendra, agyeya, yashpal, fanishwarnath renu, ushaa priyanvada, mannu bhandari, gyanaranjan, udai prakaash, omprakash balmiki aadi hindi ke pramukh kahani car hai
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has considered 'indumati' written by Kishori Lal Goswami as the first Hindi story
 iske sambandh main saamanyat: do aapattiyaan uthaai gai hai – ek yah ki ho na ho yah kisi bangala kahani kaa anuwaad ho auki duusari yah ki is par tempest kii chaaya he
 From the point of view of the period, Acharya Shukla's written 'eleven years' time is another story
 par inke pehle bhi kahaniyaan likhi gai thim
 Coincidentally, no one noticed them
 70 ke dashak main 'sarika' main hindi kii pehali kahani ke sambandh main tippaniyan-lekh prakashit hue
 Shri Varma has tried to prove Madhvaprasad Sapre's 'basket of soil' as the first Hindi story
 kishorilaal goswami kii hi likhi kahani 'pranayani' parinay hindi kii pehali moulik kahani he
 It was written in the year 1897
 isame do premiyon kii kahani kahi gai he
 The lover was undertaking to enter the girlfriend's house that the king was caught as a thief
 kintu unke pragadh prem kaa parichay paakar raja ne donon kaa vivaah kara diya
 This has the effect of Kathasaritsagar
 style puraani he, samaapan bhi bharat vaakya se hota he
 But if the story will be identified on the basis of the narrative style and the same central feeling, then it will definitely be the first original story of Hindi
 vastut: san 1900 i se 1915 i tak hindi kahani ke vikaas kaa pehla daur tha
 Spontaneity of mind 1907 AD, Gulbahar 1902 AD, Pandit and Panditani 1903 AD, eleven years time 1903 AD, Dulaiwali 1907 AD, Vidya Bahar 1909 AD, Rakhiband Bhai 1909 AD, village 1911 AD, happy life 1911 AD, Rasiya Balam 1912 AD, Pardesi 1912 AD, Kangana in the ears 1913 AD, Rakshabandhan 1913 AD, he said that the publication of 1915 AD, etc
 proves that the development of Hindi stories in this early period All the signs are found
 1950 tak hindi kahani kaa ek vistrut daur samaapt ho jaataa he or hindi kahani paripakvata ke daur main pravesh karti he
 In 1916 AD, the first story of Premchand was published
 premchand ke aagaman se hindi kaa katha-sahitya samaaj-saapeksh satya kii ore muda
 Premchand's last story 'kafan' was published in 1936, and he died in the same year
 bees varshon kii is avadhi main kahani kii kai pravritiyaan ubhar kar aain
 But if we do not see these trends separately then this whole period can be taken as a duality of ideal and reality
 is kalavadhi main 'prasad' or premchand kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Prasad is primarily a romantic storyteller
 kintu unke antim kahani sangrah 'indrajaal' main sangrahit indrajaal, gunda, saleem, viramchinh se unki yathaarthonmukhi pravriti ko pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 But being romantic, he was idealistic
 premchand ne apane ko aadarshonmukhi yathartwaadee kaha he
 In fact, he was also an idealist
 kintu apane vikaas ke antim kaal main ve yatharth kii katutaa ko bhogakar yathartwaadee ho gaye
 'pus Ki Raat' and 'kafan' are proof of this
 san '33 main niraala kaa ek sangrah 'lily' prakashit ho chukaa tha
 His stories are very realistic
 prasad kaa romentic adarsh unki praarambhik kahaniyon main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 But in Chandradhar Sharma 'guleri' story 'he had told' it is found in its entire color
 prasad kii mahatvapurn romentic kahaniyaan 'usne kaha tha' ke baad likhi gayi
 'he had said' is romantic in its nature, character-imagining, culmination
 premantnya tyaag, balidaan – yahan tak ki mrityu kaa varan sabhi kuch romentic adarsh kii paripurti karte hai
 The love that arises in an eight-year-old girl and a twelve-year-old boy emerges even after an interval of twenty-five years in such a way that Lahna Singh dies for that romantic love
 is adarsh kii raksha ke liye vaastaviktaa ko nazarandaaz kar diya gaya he
 The technical achievements of this story are unprecedented
 naatakeeyata, sthanik rang, rangeen setting, jeevant varnan, flash back, swapn aadi ko kahani main samavisht karne kaa pehla shrey unheen ko he
 Prasad has acquired certain technical characteristics of Gulerji in his stories, but he is basically lyrical
 prageeton main katha tatva kam, bhav adhik hota he
 He is the representative poet of Shadowism
 ateet ke shauryamulak chitron, prabhaavshaalee prakritik vaataavaranon, premagat antardvandon main unka man adhik rama he
 He has worked most passionately in depicting love and beauty
 ek duusari visheshta, jo praaia: alakshith rah jaati he, yah he ki unhone kahani ke paatro ko vyaktitv diya
 Subjectivity has been characteristic of cinematic poetry
 naatakon ke paatro ko bhi unhone sarvapratham vyaktitv diya
 The same thing can be said in relation to the story
 'gunda' ke babu nanhook singh jaise vyakti charitra kii sristi adwitiyata main akeli he
 Thus Madhulika, Champa, Salvati etc
 are also unforgettable
 rashtriya chetana chhayavaadi kavy ke ek vaishishtay he
 This can be seen in stories like 'awards'
 man kaa gahan antarvavandv to inaki kahani kaa muladhar he
 'akashdeep' is a living example of this
 pragitatmakataa ke sabhi tatva – atyadhik dhanatvpurn vednaa, ekthanta aadi ke liye visaati drashtavy hai
 His stories diverge from Premchand's stories due to a different point of view
 isalio aalochakon ne prasad santhaan kii kahaniyon ko premchand-santhaan kii kahaniyon se pruthak mana he
 Isolation of approach is isolation of structure
 unke kathanak main ghatnaayen kam or sthitiyon ke prati pratikriyaayein adhik hai
 As a result, theatricality has become predominant in them
 unke charitra bhi sthitiyon se guzar kar apane kriya-kalapon dwaara apane vyaktitv ko pratishthit karte hai
 Wherever the natural setting is taken it has become an essential part of the entire story
 chhayavaadi kavy kii tarah us par bhi maanviya chetana kii aarope dikhaai detaa he
 Such a combination of cognition and imagination will not be found elsewhere
 premchand ne kahaniyon ko vyashti-jivan se samshti-jivan kii ore modaa
 Prasad's stories are so close to the shadowy poetry-consciousness that they themselves have become lyrical
 unamem mishrit bhaavon ke dwandv mukhyat: kaavyatmak or vyaktimulak hai, isliye saamaanya jivan kaa pravaah vahaan nahin milegaa
 Premchand made them comfortable by embellishing the rhetoric laden on the stories
 yon premchand kii aarambhik kahaniyon main ek doosraa algaav dikhaai padataa he
 It is commonly called idealism
 par use sudhaarwad kahana chahie
 The elders' daughter's nobility, opposition to child marriage, widow-marriage support comes under reformism
 par kramash: unamem parivartan aayaa or unhone yatharth bhartiya jivan ko aankane kaa puraa prayaas kiya
 No other person tried to portray the middle class society of this country in stories with such variety
 sankhya main bhi unhone kaaphi kahaniyaan likhi hai – do sau choubees
 After writing a few stories, the storytellers often repeat themselves, but Premchand has not repeated himself
 yah unki drushti-vyapti kaa suchak he
 The manner in which he has portrayed the problems of domestic life and the irony of social life is not very complicated but is perfectly capable of exposing the immediate families and institutions
 unki aadarshonmukh or ansankrut katha-style bhartiya katha-aakhyayika ke mail main adhik he
 Later, Premchand realized that his ideals did not flourish in his life
 isaliye kalpanaatmak adarsh kaa pallaa chhodkar ve yatharth jivan kii katutaaon kaa chithran karne lage
 His changed outlook and new structure can be seen in 'pus Ki Raat' and 'kafan'
 in donon kahaniyon ko vishesh rup se antim kahani ko purnat: aadhunik kaha ja saktaa he
 These stories do not hang on to any ideal
 inamen aalochak yah nahin bataa saktaa ki kahani kaa sampreshy koi khaas vastu he
 They are their own objective - from beginning to end
 koi parinti nahin he koi charmotkarsh nahin he
 There is only semiotics, readers are allowed to fly the concept
 aaj kii aalochana main jis bhashik sarjana kii charchaa kii jaati he use inamen puri oonchaai par dekha ja saktaa he
 Both stories are beautiful examples of the process of investigation
 aashcharya to yah dekh kar hota he ki aaj kii jindagi main jis vidooshakatv kaa pravesh dekha ja rahaa he uske tevar 'kafan' main maujuud hai
 But he has put this clown in a constructive context that signifies a meaningful value view, stripping the entire society
 ek aitihaasik sangati ke falswaroop kafan main aadhunik jivan kaa akelaapan or dihyoomanizeshan sadrishy main hi samavisht ho gaya he
 This is the story of the first modernization of Hindi
 prasad or premchand santhaan ke jo lekhak hue unamem vikaas kaa koi kram lakshith nahin hota he
 His stories often do not reflect his independent personality
 raikrishnadas prasad-santhaan ke lekhak hai
 Chandiprasad Hridayesh does not have the poeticity of Prasad, only his ornament
 premchand santhaan ke lekhakon main sudarshan, vishwambharnath kowshik, raja radhikaramanprasad singh, bhagwatiprasad vaajapeyi aadi kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In the year 1922, Ugri entered Hindi-fiction
 ugr na to prasad kii tarah romentic the or na hi premchand kii bhanti aadarshonmukh yathartwaadee
 He was only realistic - from nature he exposed the bare reality of society in a strong language-style
 samaaj kii gandagi ko anaavruth karne ke kaaran tathakthith shuddhtavaadi aalochakon ne unki tikhi aalochana kii
 His literature was called Grassletti literature
 unhone saamaajik kurupataaon par tikhaa prahaar kiya
 The fire of fire, chinkariya, rape, eccentric rich, chocolate, rainbow etc
 are his famous stories
 in kahaniyon ko amaryadit or vighatak bataaya gaya he
 But if many of his stories are indefinite, then the same will have to be said in relation to many stories of today's writers
 ugr kii kahaniyon ke liye ek pratimaan tathaa aaj kii waisi hi kahaniyon ke liye doosraa pratimaan nahin lagu kiya ja saktaa
 In today's context Ugre's stories need to be reconsidered
 chaturasen shastri, rishabhcharan jain aadi par ugr kaa prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 In 27–28 CE, Jainndra started writing the story
 unki pehali kahani khel vishaal bharat main prakashit hui thi
 Her story collections are the Rajakanya, one night, two sparrows, Pajeb, Jayasandhi etc
 of the hanging Vayayan Neelam country
 unke aagaman ke saath hi hindi-kahani kaa nayaa utthan shuru hota he
 The meaning of new uplift is not clear by telling psychological stories
 unhen hindi kaa sharadchandra kah kar bhi log bhranti kii sristi karte hai
 Zainendra does not have the sentiment of Sharad Chandra
 jainendra kii kahaniyon main ek vishisht prakaar ke jivan-darshan kii khoj he
 a deep duality of mind is also depicted in Prasad's stories
 par is dwandv ke aayam simit hai
 Zainendra exposes layers of mind and tries to interpret it through it
 kahaniyon ke madhyam se satyanveshan kaa yah prayaas pehali baar jainendra kii kahaniyon main dikhaai padataa he
 Jainendra says - The story is an appetite that constantly tries to find a solution
 hamaare apane sawaal hote hai, shankaaye hoti hai, chintaayen hoti hai or ham unka uttar, unka samaadhaan khojane kaa satat praytn karte rahete hai
 Our experiments continue

 The process of this investigation is related to the trade of Gandhian non-violence and Freudian unconscious mind
 isaliye jagah jagah naitik maanon kaa prashn uthta he
 But there is also a kind of mystery and conceit in Jainndra
 yah unki visheshta or kamajori donon hai
 Later on, where his philosophy has become relaxed and investigative, his attitude is more gross and fickle
 parvarti kahaniyon kii mudraayen isi tarah kii hai
 The structure of their stories begins at the point of the individual
 avchetan man kii kuch gutthiyaan oochaal di jaati hai
 They sometimes clash with any other tendency or external morality of their own
 yah takaraahat atmpida or ahan ke vilgan main parinat hokar kahani ban jaati he
 They often find a lack of logical investigation and they fulfill it with a latent mystery
 aage kuch dinon tak premchand or jainendra kii paramparaon kaa vikaas hi hindi – kahani kaa vikaas mana gaya he
 Yashpal is originally the storyteller of Premchand's tradition
 '36 i main pragatisheel lekhak sangh kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 The inclusion of the element of progress in the writings of the writers of this time should be considered as Yugadharma
 yashpal rashtriya sangram ke ek sakriy krantikari kaaryakarta the
 That is why they considered the means of literature, not feasible
 spasht he ki unki kahaniyaan kisi na kisi uddeshy kii purti ke liye likhi gai hai
 While Premchand was an enemy of wealth, Yashpal was rich
 dhani varg hamaare samaaj ke kodh hai
 At the core of all cultural-moral inconsistencies is the inequality of money
 marks ke saath hi in par frid kaa bhi gaharaa prabhaav he
 As a result, open images of sexual consciousness will also be found in his story novels
 inke darjanon kehani-sangrah prakashit ho chuke hai - pinjade kii udaan, wo duniya, gyandaan, abhishpt, tark kaa tufaan, bhasmaavruth chingaari, phulon kaa kurta, uttami kii maan aadi
 The stories of Yashpal are taken as illustrations
 isliye unki kahaniyaan bahut kuch niojit hoti hai
 The main basis of this planning is imagination - not perception
 premchand kii rachana-prakriya se inaki rachana-prakriya kaaphi milti-julati he
 In Premchand's stories, a static idea comes first and later the characters, situations, events etc
 are explored according to it
 yashpal kii prakriya isse bhinn nahin he
 In Premchand, reformism predominates, Yashpal has Marxism and Freudism
 ve vichaaron ke kahanikar hai, chintan ke nahin
 They are unmatched in deep satire on social characteristics and the hollowness of middle class society
 yashpal kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki katha kaa ras unamem sarvatra miltaa he
 Agnostics are experimental artists
 unke aagaman ke saath kahani nai disha kii ore mudi
 The first prize of modernity which is discussed a lot today remains unknowable - in poetry as well as in fiction
 prayogdharma hone ke saath saath ve apane abhijaateey sanskaron ke kaaran sachet bhi hai
 The Romani rebellion appears in his early stories
 lekin kramash ve romance se hatate gayi
 He repeatedly mentions the omission of ego, it is an attempt to break away from romance
 unki shreshth kahaniyon main unke ahan ne dakhal nahin diya he
 Therefore, she has become unique in her synthesis
 vipagaatha, parampara, kothri kii baat, sharnaarthi, jaydol or ye tere praturup unke kahani sangrah hai
 The stories in both earlier collections feature Ego Blast and Romani Rebellion
 sharnaarthi kii kahaniyaan bauddhik sahanubhuti se prerit hone ke kaaran rachanaatmak nahin ban padi hai
 But the stories in the Jaidol collection hold their own
 is sangrah kii adhikansh kahaniyon main ahan purnat visarjeet he
 Out of his sight, there has been completeness in his vision and synthesis in composition
 udaahranarth unki do kahaniyon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In 'gangrene', the monotony of the middle class is taken as a whole
 yah ekresata uske sanrachanaatmak str par chitrit milegi
 It cannot be found as a culmination or a squeeze - the story has to be taken whole to get it
 'gangrene' madhyavargeey jivan kii ekresata kaa jabardast pratik he
 But it has been created through ambient, flashback, image, symbol
 na phaltu shabd or na hi praarambhik kahaniyon kii tarah visheshnon kii bharmaar
 The domestic environment, the carrot of three, ton-ton of hour, pipe-drip etc
 all create some monogamous environment
 'pathaar kaa dhiraj' bhi apni rachanaatmak sanshlishtataa or aadhuniktaa bodh ke kaaran mahatvapurn ban padi he
 The love stories of the two ages which give their own different realization, are tied in an internal union and reach near Parabul
 ashk premchand parampara ke kahanikar hai
 They too have selected the plot from middle class society
 kahani sambandhi vividh prayog unki rachana main milenge
 But in experimental compositions, a kind of orthodox artificiality is found
 jivan kii gahari anubhuti dachi, kakdaan kaa taili jaisi kahaniyon main uplabdh hoti he
 Apart from Ashka, novelists like Vrindavanlal Varma, Bhagavati Charan Varma, Elachandra Joshi, Amritlal Nagar have also worked in the field of stories
 kintu inkaa vaastavik kshetra upanyaas he kahani nahin
 After this, Hindi stories from around 50 AD go through a new phase
 in do dashakon main viksit kahaniyon kii pravriti ko ek naam dena kathin he
 If any name can be given, it is the stories of modernism
 aadhuniktaa yani vigyaan or pravidhi kii yantrikta main jakade jatil-jivan-bodh kii kahaniyaan
 To differentiate them from traditional Hindi stories, they came to be called new stories
 vastut nai kahaniyaan naam nai kavita ke vazan par rakhaa gaya
 Some consider these stories to be the development of the stories of earlier generations and some do not desist from the dogma of saying it as a new one, by cutting from tradition or rejecting it
 vastut in naamon main kuch arthpurna nahin he
 To distinguish oneself from the new story, more names have been kept - conscious story, unsaid etc
 par naamon par bahes karnaa bemaani he
 Story is a story
 yug parivartan ke saath uski pravritiyaan badalengi hi
 Within a few years of the attainment of independence - happiness in the Indian environment - anti-depression voices were heard
 kuch log rashtriya aakankshaon ke purtyrth ashanvit the or kuch logon kaa moh-bhang ho chukaa tha
 The attainment of independence was a romantic event
 gram tathaa uske anchal sambhddha kahaniyon main romani yatharth chitrit hua he
 The stories of Shivprasad Singh, Markandeya and Phaniswarnath Renu can be placed in this category
 unki kuch kahaniyon main jeevat bhi miltaa he
 But most such stories, despite being well-known and partly based on realities, still represent old values
 in do dashakon main dekhte dekhte dada, baba, maai ke prati vyakt kii gai aasthaa ulat gai or vah puraane-nae mulyon ke sangharsh ke rup main chitrit kii jane lagi
 This clash reports new changes
 aadhunik jivan main kuch aisa tut gaya he ki puraane saare sambandh badal gaye hai
 The romantic relationship has become valueless in its tensions and has also become meaningless
 mohan rakesh ne in tanaavon ko mukhya rup se apni kahaniyon main vyakt kiya he
 Kamleshwar seeks price vision amidst tensions
 nirmal verma multah romentic hote hue bhi kuch kahaniyon main aaj kii saamaajik vidambnaa – nirarthak cheekh – ko prabhaavshaalee dhang se chitrit karte hai
 Dharamvir Bharti, Raghuvir Sahai and Naresh Mehta are poets first and storytellers later
 inamen bharti kaa vyaktitv sabase adhik nirlep kshamtawan or mulyaparak he
 His poetic personality does not dominate his stories
 yathaprasang vah sahaayta hi pahunchaata he
 The 'gulki Banno' stored in this collection is a proof of this
 rajendra yadav, mannu bhandari, ushaa priyanvada, krishna sobati, shrikant verma, krishna baldev vaid, raajakmal choudhary aadi tanaavon ke hi kahanikar hai
 These tensions, husband-wife, father-son, brother-sister, lover-girlfriend will all be seen
 vyakti or samaaj ke bich gahari khai paidaa ho gai he
 People living in the midst of stress are finding themselves lonely, strangers and miserable
 yah is desh ke buddhijiviyon kii hi sthiti nahin he
 People from other countries are experiencing this situation even more sharply
 sara jivan itnaa jatil or yantric ho gaya he ki manushya yantrgatik ho chalaa he
 He has lost his identity
 sthiti yahan tak bighad gai he ki uske liyen zindagi kaa arth he ki vah arthhin he
 One more generation
 yani gyanaranjan, doodhnath singh, vijaymohan singh, rabindra kaaliya, mahendra bhalla aadi kii kritiyaan inaki kahaniyon main aadhuniktaa kaa vah rup he jo ub, ghutan, vyarthta aadi ko abhivyakt karata he
 These storytellers often do not recover from tragic human conditions
 in kahanikaron main gyanaranjan kii drushti sarvaadhik santulit, gaiyr romani or nae unmershon ko pakad paane main samarth he
 The next list of storytellers is long - Kashinath Singh, Ibrahim Sharif, Israel, Vishveshwar, Sudha Arora etc
 kashinath singh or ibrahim sharif aadhuniktaa se alag hat kar jivan kii visangatiyon main hi sahi raste kii talash kii koshish kii he
 This process of giving meaning to a meaningless life is a sign of healthy attitude
 aayo, hamaare saura mandal ke paanchave grah brihaspati kaa teesraa sab se bada upgrah he or yah puure saura mandal kaa chauthaa sab se bada chandramaa he
 Ayo has a diameter of 3,642 km

 Due to Jupiter being so close, the tidal force created by the fierce gravity of that planet keeps the ions from which many volcanoes are on this satellite

 Ayo was Zeus's girlfriend in ancient Greek religious legends
 zyoos kaa unani dharm main vahi sthaan he jo bharat main brihaspati kaa he
 "jupiter" is the Roman name of Zeus
 aayo prithvi ke chandramaa se thodaa bada he - uskaa vyas chandramaa ke vyas se lagbhag 5% adhik he
 The structure of Aayo resembles that of stone planets like Earth, Venus and Mars

 When scientists first saw images of the surface of Ayo, they were surprised to find that there were no craters made of meteorites falling on it, while there are many such craters on the satellites of the moon, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter
 uske bajaae unhen ek laal, pili, hari rang-birangi sataha dikhi
 This was because Jupiter, Ganymede, Kalisto and Europa's tidal force is badly intertwined with lava emanating from many volcanoes

 Pie Bandage: Pie Backbonding · Conjugation · Hyperconjugation · Aromaticity · Metal aromaticitydelta Bond: Quadruple Bond · Quintuple Bond · Sextuple Bond upbhasha vigyaan yaa boli vigyaan bhashavigyaan kii ek he shakha jo boliyon ko bhugolic vitaran or vyakaran kii drushti se apane adhyayan kaa lakshya banaati he
 Considering geographical distribution, social classes, ethnic levels, occupational diversity and religious, cultural characteristics are also taken into consideration
 in sab ke atirikt boli vigyaan kaa ek lakshya or bhi he jise koshvigyaan kaa ang mana jaataa he
 In this, the words of different dialects are stored in phonetic transcription and their signal limits are explained
 bhashaa or boli ke bich kii bhedakarekha "paraspar bodhgamyata" ke anusaar nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 There are four levels of this comprehension - purna bodhgamyata, apurna bodhgamyata, aanshik bodhgamyata, shunya bodhgamyata Based on these levels of comprehension, individual categories, sub-language, dialect and language categories are classified
 purna bodhgamyata ek boli kshetra ke rahanevaale vyaktiyon kii praaia: samaan vakpravriti kaa sanket detii he
 The latest belief in descriptive linguistics is that not every person's eloquence is exactly the same
 kintu yah asamanta itani sthool nahin hoti ki ve ek duusare kii baat na samaj saken
 In this way, the coordinated form of individual eloquences is the individual form and the coordinated form of the individual dialects is the subboli and the coordinated form of subboli
 isi prakaar boliyon kii samanvit ikai bhashaa he
 It is clear from the above assumption that different levels of comprehension are activated between the person dialect and language
 bhashaa ke adhyayan main adhiktar upboli ke str tak vichaar kiya jaataa he kintu boli ke sandarbh main vyaktiboliyon kaa bhi mahatv hota he
 At the linguistic level, there is a combination of person-language and sub-language and dialect and language-second
 jis prakaar boli or bhashaa yaa bhashaaon ke simavarti kshetron main rupavaishishty hote hue bhi ek duusare ko samajhnaa saral hota he, usee prakaar yaa usase bhi adhik bodhgamyata boli yaa upboli kii simaaon par hoti he
 Due to such intelligibility found in the border areas, no clear dividing line can be drawn between language and dialect or dialect or subpoena
 ek bhashiya kshetra main sthaneey bhedon ke adhyayan ko bluemfield ne boli bhugol kaa naam dete hue use tulanaatmak vidha kii uplabdhiyon kaa poorak bhi kaha he
 The study of dialects is most popular in the form of dialect atlas
 boli kshetra ke ye atlas maanchitron ke aise sankalan hai jinpar bhashiya rupavaishishtyon ko sthaneey vitaran ke aadhaar par samroop rekhaon ke madhyam se pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 Detailed features cannot be displayed on these maps
 keval bhedak rup hi pradarshit kiye jate hai
 That is why many people consider dialect grammar, demarcation of dialects, lexicography and comparative, historical findings only as a means of dialectology
 atlason ko bhashaa bhugol se sambhddha maanakar use boli vigyaan se pruthak kar dete hai
 There are three areas divided by identical lines: avshesh kshetra aise kshetra jahaan ke rahanevaale aarthik drushti se aviksit hote hai or jahaan kii bhugolic sthiti aisi ho ki aasaani se pahunch paanaa kathin ho, un kshetron main pracheenatam rup mil sakate hai
 Others often consider the forms of these places to be hey
 aakarshan kshetra - in kshetron main aarthik yaa audyogic drushti se koi mahatvapurn centre hota he
 This center is the source of the emergence of new forms
 isliye samroop rekhaon kaa jhukaav bhi kendrabhimukh hota he
 Transition zone - One-time use of forms is not found in such areas
 samroop rekhaayen ek duusare ko katati hui jaati hai yaa unke bich kaa antar adhik hota he
 It can be said about the attraction areas that their forms must have been prevalent in this area from long ago and they have taken away their rival words from the position of behavior and have taken control over the whole area
 avshesh kshetra ke rup sab se puraane maane jate hai or sankraman kshetravaale rup is baat kaa sanket dete hai ki kisi vyavahaargat puraane rup ke upar kisi nae rup ko praathamikta mil rahi he
 Such a study of dialects originated with Schmeler in the first phase of the 19th century
 1873 main skit ne "english dialectology sosayadi" kii sthapana kii or atlas banane kaa bhi prayaas kiya
 In 1876, George Banker adapted a 40-sentence questionnaire into more than 40,000 local dialects throughout the German state

 Swaraj literally means 'self-government' or "one's own kingdom"
 bharat ke rashtriya aandolan ke samay prachlit yah shabd aatm-nirnay tathaa swadhinata kii maang par bal detaa tha
 The early nationalists, considering independence as a far-reaching goal, preferred the goal of 'good government' over 'self-government'
 tatpashchaat ugravadi kaal main yah shabd lokapriy hua, jab bal gangadhar tilak ne yah udghoshnaa kii ki ‘‘swaraj meraa janm siddh adhikaar he or main ise lekar rahoonga
 Gandhi first said in 1920 that "my Swaraj is a demand for parliamentary rule for India, which will be based on adult suffrage
" gandhi kaa mat tha swaraj kaa arth he janpratinidhiyon dwaara sanchalit aisi vyavastha jo jan-aavashyaktaaon tathaa jan-aakankshaon ke anuroop ho
 In fact, Gandhiji's idea of swaraj was a movement to boycott Britain's political, social, economic, bureaucratic, legal, military and educational institutions
 yadhyapi gandhiji kaa swaraj kaa sapana puri tarah se praapt nahin kiya ja sakaa phir bhi unke dwaara sthapit anek swayamsevi sansthaaon ne is disha main kaaphi prayaas kiye
 Gandhi's concept of 'swaraj' is very broad
 swaraj kaa arth keval raajnneetik str par videshi shashan se swadhinata praapt karnaa nahin he, balki isamen saanskrithik va naitik swadhinata kaa vichaar bhi nihit he
 It emphasizes mutual cooperation and reconciliation in nation building
 shashan ke str par yah ‘sachche loktantr kaa paryaay’ he
 Gandhi's Swaraj is 'swaraj of the Poor', which inspires the salvation of the oppressed
 yah aatm-sayanm, gram-rajya va satta ke vikendrikaran par bal detaa he
 Gandhi supported 'sarvodaya' i
e
 all-welfare
 ahisantmak samaajaigandhi kii drushti main adarsh samaaj-vyavastha vahi ho sakati he, jo purnatah ]]ahimsa]]tmak ho
 Where the idea of violence itself will disappear, there will be no need for 'punishment' or 'use of force', that is, there will be no need for political power or state in an ideal society
 gandhi hinsa tathaa shoshan par aadhaarit vartmaan raajnneetik dhaanche ko samaapt karke, uske sthaan par ek aisi vyavastha sthapit karnaa chaahate the, jo vyakti kii sahmati par aadhaarit ho tathaa jiskaa uddeshy ahimsaatmak tareekon se jan-kalyaan main yogadan dena ho
 According to Gandhi, a non-violent society would be stateless
 vah rajya kaa virodh is aadhaar par karte hai, ki na to yah swaabhaavik sanstha he or na hi aavashyak he
 He, like the philosophical anarchist, rejected the state on this basis - gandhi ke anusaar raajnneetik shakti saadhy nahin balki prayek kshetra main logon ke vikaas main sahyog dene kaa saadhan he
 It regulates national life by national representatives
 yadi rashtriya jivan itnaa paripurna ho jaae ki aatmaniyamit ho jaaain to kisi bhi pratinidhi kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 In such a situation, each ruler is his own
 vah swayan par is prakaar shashan karata he, ki vah apane padosi ke liye baadha nahin banataa
 In such an ideal situation there is no political power, because there is no state in it
 gandhi ne use ‘‘prabud araajaktaa kii sthiti’’ kaha he
 This is 'ram Rajya'
 tollstoy ne ise ‘‘prithvi par parameshwar kaa rajya’’ kaha he
 Gandhi's stateless, classless society will be divided into many self-governed and self-sufficient village communities

 There will be decentralization of power

 Gandhi has called it 'real self-rule'
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki is prakaar ke sangh ke prabandh va samposhan ke liye sarkaar aavashyak hogi
 Therefore, a modern critic is of the view that Gandhi's ideal society was primarily a non-violent state, not a non-violent, stateless society
 duusari ore aabid hossain kaa mat he ki gandhi kaa ram rajya purna araajaktaavaadi rajyaviheen samaaj he, jo naitik kanoon dwaara shasit he
 In this type of non-violent society, peace and order will be established by the power of love or self-confidence in the form of satyagraha
 gandhi ke anusaar satyagrah vyaktiyon, virgon tathaa rashtron ke madhya shoshan tathaa daman kaa pratirodh karne kaa prabhaavapurn yantra he
 Gandhi was of the view that the goal of establishing a stateless and classless non-violent society would not be easily achieved
 atah rajya ko tatkaal samaapt karnaa thik he
 Consequently, their goal is to mold the state in accordance with the principles of non-violence
 ahimsak rajya main saamaajik vyavhaar ko niyamit karne hetu ek prakaar kii sarkaar tathaa raajnneetik satta hogi, kintu vah kam se kam shashan karegi, kyonki saamaajik jivan aatm niyamit hoga
 The person will get complete freedom
 adhikansh kaary swayamsevi sansthaaon dwaara sampann honge
 These ideas of Gandhi resemble guild socialists like Russell, G

 gandhi kaa janatantric samaaj ek samaajawaadee rajya hoga
 Being influenced by Bhagwat Purana, he believed that - gandhi nijee sampatti ke samaapan ke paksh main nahin hai kintu aarthik samanta laana chaahate hai
 Economic equality means adequate and balanced food for all, housing and khadi to cover the body
 vah swadeshi kaa paksh lete hue kutir va laghu udyog tathaa khaadi udyogon ke vikaas par bal dete hai
 Gandhi opposed the production by technology oriented industries or machines and instead gave preference to labor intensive industries
 unke anusaar utpaadan logon dwaara kiya jaae, factriyon dwaara nahin
 Gandhi taught under the 'labor principle' that every person should contribute to their consumption by doing manual labor
 chunki isamen prayek prakaar kii seva yaa shram ko ek jaisaa sammaan diya jayega, isliye shram kii garima sthapit hogi tathaa vargeey bhed mit jane se ‘vargvihin’ samaaj kii sthapana hogi
 Gandhi has not supported the acquisition of property of landowners and capitalists
 isai samaajwaadiyon kii tarah vah poonjipatiyon kii manovriti main prem va anunay dwaara parivartan laakar apana aarthik samanta kaa lakshya praapt karnaa chaahate the
 The capitalist should not consider himself as the owner of the property and should be considered as trustee or trustee
 jo sampatti unke paas he, use ve samaaj kii dharohar samajhen
 Out of that they spend as much for themselves as is appropriate for their services, give the rest of the society a lot, that is, distribute among the poor
 utpaadan kaa lakshya munafa ne hokar sampoorn samaaj kaa hit hona chahie
 There should be participation in the management of workers
 yadi poonjipati trustee bananaa sweekaar na karen, to kanoon dwaara rajya ko bhoomi tathaa utpaadan ke anya sadhano par niyantran kar lenaa chahie
 Gandhi has propounded the principle of Sarvodaya in terms of general interest or welfare of all
 yah siddhant aisi niti kaa samarthan karata he, jiskaa uddeshy jaat-paat, dharm-sampradaay, stri-purush, oonch-neech aadi ke bhedbhaav mitaakar samaaj ke sabhi staron par kalyaan kaary ko badhaava dena he
 This will develop mutual cooperation and goodwill
 gandhi ke sarvoday kaa siddhant rajya ke lakshya kaa siddhant he
 Utilitarian thinkers Bentham and JS While Mill was in favor of "maximum welfare of the most people", John Ruskin favored the "last or neglected minority"
 gandhi ne in donon siddhanton ke sammishran se ek nayaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya, jise sarvoday yaa ‘‘samaaj ke sabhi logon ke utthan yaa kalyaan’’ kaa siddhant kaha jaataa he
 Later Vinoba Bhave followed this principle
 gandhi paramparaagat arth main na to raajnneetik chintak the or na hi siddhant nirmaataa the, kintu vah bhartiya swadhinata aandolan ke agradoot tathaa shreshth samaaj sudhaarak the
 On the one hand, he led the non-cooperation, Civil Disobedience and Quit India Movement on the basis of truth and non-violence, on the other hand campaigned against casteism, communalism and untouchability
 maikayavali ke vipareet unhone raajnneeti va naitikta main sambandh sthapit kar saadhan va saadhy main sambandh sthapit kiya
 Like the Western liberals, he believed in personal freedom and representative democracy
 rajya ke uddeshy ke rup main unki sarvoday kii sankalpana mahatvapurn he
 Being a Karmayogi, Gandhi believed in the dignity of labor
 gandhi kii vargaheen tathaa rajyaviheen samaaj kii pariklpana avyavhaarik prathit hoti he
 Gandhi himself accepts this as well
 kintu unke raajnneetik va aarthik kshetra main vikendrikaran, gramin swayattashasi vyavastha evam rojgaar, swadeshi aadi sambandhi vichaaron ke mahatva ko asweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The principles of his Satyagraha, Swaraj and Sarvodaya are important contributions to political philosophy

 Draupadi was married to all five Pandava brothers

 According to the epic Mahabharata of ancient India, Draupadi was born from Yajnakund at Maharaj Drupada
 atah yah ‘yagyaseni’ bhi kahalaai
 Draupadi was the daughter of a sage in a previous birth
 usne pati paane kii kaamana se tapasya kii
 Shankar was pleased and wished to give him the bride
 usne shankar se paanch baar kaha ki vah sarvagunsampann pati chaahati he
 Shankar said that she would have five Bharatvanshi husbands in the next birth, as she had repeated the desire to have a husband five times
 jab pandav tathaa kaurav rajkumaron kii shiksha purna ho gai to unhone dronacharya ko guru dakshina deni chaahi
 Dronacharya remembered his insult done by Drupada and he said to the princes, "princes! If you want to give Gurudakshina, then make the Panchal king Drupada a prisoner and present it to me
 yahi tum logon kii gurudakshina hogi
 "on Gurudev's saying like this, all the princes took their weapons and went towards the Panchal country
 paanchal pahunchne par arjuna ne dronacharya se kaha, "gurudev! aap pehle kauravon ko raja drupad se yuddh karne kii ajna dijiye
 If they fail to arrest Drupada, we will fight Pandava
 " guru kii ajna milane par duryodhana ke netritv main kauravon ne paanchal par akraman kar diya
 There was a fierce war between the two sides, but in the end the Kauravas escaped and fled
 kauravon ko palaayan karte dekh pandavon ne akraman armbh kar diya
 In the face of Bhimsen and Arjuna's might, the Panchal king's army was defeated
 arjuna ne aage bad kar drupad ko bandi bana liya or guru dronacharya ke samaksh le aaye
 Seeing Drupada as a prisoner, Dronacharya said, "O Drupada! Now i have become the lord of your kingdom
 main to tumhen apana mitra samaj kar tumhaare paas aayaa tha kintu tumne mujhe apana mitra sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 Now tell me, do you accept my friendship? "drupada bowed his head with shame and apologized for his mistake and said," o Drona! It was a mistake for me not to treat you as a friend and for that i now have remorse in my heart
 main tathaa meraa rajya donon hi ab aapke aadhin hai, ab aapaki jo ichha ho karen
 "dronacharya said," You said that friendship happens among people of the same class
 atah main tumse barabari kaa mitra bhav rakhane ke liye tumhen tumhaara aadha rajya lautaa rahaa hoon
 "having said this, Dronacharya handed over the state of the southern bank of the Ganges to Drupada and kept the rest himself
 guru dron se parajeet hone ke uparant maharaj drupad atyant lajjit huye or unhen kisi prakaar se nicha dikhaane kaa upaay sochane lage
 In this concern, once he wandered and reached the colony of Brahmins of Kalyani city
 vahaan unki bhent yaaj tathaa upyaaj naamak mahaan karmkandi brahman bhaaiyon se hui
 King Drupada pleased him by serving him and asked him the solution to kill Dronacharya
 unke poochne par bade bhai yaaj ne kaha, "iske liye aap ek vishaal yajna kaa aayojan karke agnidev ko prasann kijiye jisase ki ve aapako ve mahaan balashaali putr kaa vardaan de denge
 "maharaj performed the yajna and the yajya as per his instructions
 unke yajna se prasann ho kar agnidev ne unhen ek aisa putr diya jo sampoorn aayudh evam kavach kundal se yukt tha
 After that a girl was born from that sacrificial fire, whose eyes were bright like a lotus in bloom, eyebrows were like the moon and her character was bright

 The child was named Dhritashyumna and the girl was named Krishna

 There, the king-maharaja of many countries have come for the Swayamvara of Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada
 " Ved Vyas - You go to Panchal

 That girl is absolutely worthy of you people, Shiva gave her the boon of having five good husbands in her next life

 Addressing the gathering, Dhrishtadyum said, "my sister Draupadi will be married to kings and emperors from various countries and other dignitaries
 " One after the other, all the kings and princes tried to hit the eye of a moving fish by looking at its image in the water below, but success did not hit them and they returned to their place without any trouble

 When the Kauravas failed, as soon as Karna raised the bow to aim, Draupadi refused to marry Karna at the behest of Shri Krishna, calling him a son
 tab shri krishna ke aadesh par ek brahman ko rajkumaari ne praapt karnaa chaha
 Arjun, looking at the image in the oil tank, shot with the same arrow
 draupadi ne aage bad kar arjuna ke gale main varmala daal diya
 All the Kshatriya kings-maharajas and princes got angry and attacked Arjuna after seeing Draupadi putting a garland on the neck of a Brahmin
 pandavon tathaa kshatriya raajaaon main ghamaasan yuddh hone laga
 The Pandavas took Draupadi along and reached there where they were staying with their mother Kunti
 dwaar se hi arjuna ne pukaar kar apni mata se kaha, "maate! aaj ham log aapke liye ek adbhut bhiksha le kar aaye hai
 "kunti said from within," Sons! You people consume it together

 Rama is recognized as an incarnation of God in ancient India
 hindu dharm main ram vishnu ke das avtaron main se saatven avatar hai
 The life and might of Rama is described as the Sanskrit epic Ramayana composed by Maharishi Valmiki
 goswami tulsidas ne bhi unke jivan par kendrit bhakthibhaavpurn suprasiddh mahakavy shri ramcharitamanas kii rachana kii he
 Apart from these two, Ramayana has also been composed in other Indian languages, which are also very famous
 khaas taur par uttar bharat main ram atyant poojyaneey hai or adarsh purush hai
 They are also embellished with the term Purushottam
 ram, ayodhya ke raja dasharath or rani kaushalya ke sabase bade putr the
 Ram's wife was named Sita and had three brothers - Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna
 hanuman, bhagwaan ram ke, sabase bade bhakt maane jate hai
 Rama killed Ravana, the king of Lanka
 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum
 inkaa parivaar adarsh bhartiya parivaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away
 jangal main ram ko hanuman jaisaa mitra or bhakt mila jisane ram ke saare kaary puure karaaye
 Rama finds Sita with the help of monkeys
 samudr main pul bana kar lanka pahunche tathaa ravan ke saath yuddh kiya
 After killing him, bring Sita back
 ram ke ayodhya lautne par bharat ne rajya unako hi saunp diya
 Ram was justice-loving
 unhone bahut acha shashan kiya isliye log aaj bhi achche shashan ko raamarajy kii upama dete hai
 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas
 ramakatha se sambaddh sarvaadhik pramanbhoot granth adikavy valmikiy ramayana main ram-janm ke sambandh main nimnlikhit varnan uplabdh he:- xxrep 22

 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position
 isi kaaran unhen maryaada purushottam ram ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama
 ayodhya main ram sita sukhpurvak rahane lage
 People wanted Rama very much
 unki mridul, janasevayukta bhaavana or nyaaypriyata ke kaaran unki vishesh lokapriyata thi
 King Dasharatha was heading towards Vanaprastha
 at: unhone rajyabhaar ram ko saunpne kaa sochaa
 There was also a pleasant wave in public that their beloved king is about to appoint their beloved prince as king
 us samay ram ke anya do bhai bharat or shatrughna apane nanihaal kaikey gaye hue the
 Kaikeyi's maid Manthara misleads Kaikeyi that the king is doing wrong with you
 tum raja kii priy rani ho to tumhaari santan ko raja bananaa chahie par raja dasharath ram ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 a detailed account of Rama's childhood is found in the Balakanda of Swami Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas
 raja dasharath ke teen raniyaan thim: kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi
 Ram was the son of Kaushalya, Sumitra had two sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna and Kaikeyi's son Bharata
 rajya niyamo se raja kaa jyeshtha ladkaa hi raja banane kaa paatr hota he at: ram ko ayodhya kaa raja bananaa nishchit tha
 Kaikeyi who twice saved Dasharatha's life and Dasaratha gave her the boon that she could ask for two brides at any moment of her life
 ram ko raja banate hue or bhavishya ko dekhte hue kaikeyi chaahati thi uskaa putr bharat hi raja bane, isliye unhone raja dasharath dwaara ram ko 14 varsh kaa vanvaas dilaayaa or apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajya maang liya
 In the verses, the king Dasaratha was forced to accept this
 ram ne apane pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya
 Ram's wife Sita and her brother Lakshmana also went to exile
 vanvaas ke samay, ravan ne sita kaa haran kiya tha
 Ravana was a demon and the king of Lanka
