 As with the prohibition order, inducement is also an extremely ancient order, by which the "queens Bench Division" of the Anglo Court controlled the proceedings of tribunals and aeon tribunals
 is vicitra namakaran kaa rahasy yah he ki iske latin praaroop ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki anveshnic kaarywahiyon ko samraji ke samaksh prastut kiye jane ke purv unka "queens bench divijan" dwaara pramanikaran ho jaae
 Instruction orders are issued only if the orders of the Tribunal, or the Kalpa Tribunal, transgress their powers, violate the principles of natural justice or are corrupted by any confusion of law which is clearly visible in them
 adyavadhi kisi aisi nibhram pareekshanvidhi kii udbhaavna nahin kii ja saki he jiske dwaara ham kalp nyaayik kaarywahi tathaa prashasnic kaarywahi ke bich koi vibhaajak rekha khinch saken
 Insolvency orders can be issued only against orders arising from judicial proceedings, hence the need for partition has arisen
 sthal aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki jab ek vargvishesh ke vyaktiyon ko yah vaid shakti pradaan kii jaati he ki ve nyaayik kartavyon kaa paalan karte hue vyaktivishesh ke adhikaron kaa nirnay karenge, us dasha main unako kaarywahi kalpanyayik hogi
 On the contrary, if the decision of an officer is evaluated on the basis of its policy, in that case the action will normally be called administrative but if the concerned officer reaches a decision on the basis of the sanction and objection by the witness
 It is necessary that the officer follows the judicial system
 is prakaar kii kaarywahi anshat: kalp-nyaayik hogi, bhale hi antim nirnay prashasnic kaha jaae
 The decision of whether an action is imaginary or not ultimately depends on three things - utpreshan pradesh, kisi adhikari dwaara die gaye us aadesh ko dhwast karne ke liye jari kiya jaataa he jab ki adhikari kaa baad vishay main vyaktigat swaarth ho, athwa baad vishay ke paksh yaa vipaksh ke prati uske mastishk main purvaagrah vidyaman ho
 Just having justice is not enough but it is necessary that it should be directly visible that justice has been done
 jab koi aadesh, kisi adhikari dwaara, duusare paksh ko sunwaayee kaa avasar die bina hi paarit kar diya jaataa he us avasthaa main bhi utpreshnadesh jari kiya jaataa he
 The inducing command is also issued to destroy the decision whose fault is directly visible in it
 ""pratyaksh drushtigochar hone"" kii koi nishchit vyakhya sambhav nahin kintu itnaa to nishchit he ki is kathan kii aad main nyaayalay apil nyaayalayavat aacharan nahin karegaa
 Decisions not supported by the witness can also be overturned by this order
 jahaan nyaayik athwa kalpanyaadhik adhikari, simaavishyak tathaa kisi doshapurn dharna par apni seemaa kaa balaat atikaraman kar koi nirnay detaa he, vahaan nyaayalay tadvishyak tathyon kii upasthiti kii chaanbin bhi kar saktaa he
 In other ordinary cases the court will not interfere with the conclusions supported by the witness
 prakarantar se ullikhit sakshi ko nyaayalay usee dasha main sweekrut karegaa jab yah siddh hoga ki dhwast nirnay kapat dwaara praapt tha athwa aisa karte hue adhikarsima kaa atikaraman kiya gaya
 This order is not a prima facie issue but is issued officially and on the plea of the aggrieved party for the fulfillment of justice, the encroachment of the working limit or the disregard of natural justices

 Instead of solving the Navier – Stoles equation, the Discrete Boltzmann equation is solved
 iske dwaara neutonian taral kaa bahaav bhatnagar-gros-crooke oparator samaan colizan modelon kaa simulation karne hetu kiya jaataa he
 The Boltzmann equation is the evolution equation for the single-particle probability distribution function f { \ displaystyle f}: jahaan f { \ displaystyle F} bahari bal he evam ω { \ displaystyle \ Omega } colizan samakalak he
 Lattice Boltzmann method discretizes this equation
 iske liye ye spes ko ek latis evam velocity spes ko velocity sets v i { \ displaystyle v_{i}} main discrytaise kar detaa he
 The Boltzmann equation, which has now become the Lattice Boltzmann equation, becomes: The collision operator is often approximated by a BGK collision operator: where fi 0 { \ displaystyle f_ {i} ^ {0}} is the local equilibrium distribution
 The moments of the f i { \ displaystyle f_{i}} give the local conserved quantities
 The density is given by and the local momentum is given by For the popular isothermal lattice Boltzmann methods these are the only conserved quantities
 Thermal models also conserve energy and therefore have an additional conserved quantity: The collision operator has to respect the conservation laws
 Therefore the equilibirum distribution fi 0 { \ displaystyle f_ {i} ^ {0}} must have the same conserved moments as the fi { \ displaystyle f_ {i}}

 nideshkon kaa kartavya he ki ve daksh hon, unhen company ke hiton kii parvaah ho or ve parishramee hon
 yah adhikaar company ko apane nideshak se kshatipurti paane kaa hakdaar banaata he yadi yah sabit ho jaae ki nideshak main paryaapt dakshata athwa parvaah nahin hone ke kaaran company ko nuksaan hua he
 It is also the duty of directors not to conflict with their interests or duties to act in the best interests of the company
