 Digital electronic computers, like the Eniac, signaled the end of most analog computing machines, but hybrid analog computers controlled by digital electronics remained largely in use in the 1950s and 1960s and later in some specific applications
 But like all digital devices, the decimal precision of a digital instrument is limited compared to an analog instrument that has a range of accuracy

 In doing so, Turing introduced the definition of a universal computer that implements programs stored on a tape
 is nirmaan ko turing mashin kaha gaya
 It is said that modern computers are Turing-complete except for the limits enforced by their fixed memory repositories that have the capability of computing computation equivalent to a universal Turing machine, for example

 Historically, radicalism has been specifically referred to as the radical left, and rarely incorporated remote-right-wing politics, though it may have revolutionary elements; a major exception is in the United States, where some believe that both the radical left and the political extreme of the radical south are involved in radicalism

 In this way, after a certain period, if all these items are accounted for, then one country has to take payment from another and the other country has to pay the payment of a third country
 vibhinn deshon ke bich is prakaar ke parasparik len dein ke shesh ko bhugtan shesh kehete hai
 It should be said that the difference between the gross amount repaid by a country to other countries on a given date and the gross amount it receives from other countries is called the 'balance of payments' of that country
 kisi ek desh ko duusare deshon se bhugtan praapt karne kaa adhikaar tathaa avasar tab aata he jab vah desh un deshon ko maal niryaat kare, athwa apane jahaajon, bainkon, insurance companiyon tathaa kushal visheshgyon dwaara apni sevaayen pradaan kare athwa un deshon ke udyog vyapaar main apni poonji lagaakar labhaansh tathaa byaaj praapt karen
 It may also happen that he receives payment of the principal of loans given by that country to other countries or he gets loan form from other countries
 iske atirikt yah bhi sambhav he ki anya deshon ke deshaatak paryatak us desh main aakar maal khariden yaa sevaaon kaa upbhog kare
 In all these circumstances, that country will have the opportunity to receive payment from other countries
 iske vipareet, sambhav he, inhen madon par us desh ko anya deshon kaa kuch bhugtan chukaana bhi ho
 Thus, on one date, the difference between the successful liability of a country on all these items will be known as the remaining balance of that country
 vaise to desh ke bich is prakaar kaa len dein kisi na kisi mad par nirantar chalata rahata he, par yadi kisi nishchit tithi ko ek desh kaa vibhinn madon par len dein kaa antar nikaala jaae to avashya nimna paristhitiyon main se koi ek paristhiti saamne aati he: Thus the balance of payments is called 'favorable', 'counter-productive' and 'balanced' or 'favor', 'opposition' and 'equal'
 par iskaa sambandh kisi desh vishesh ke saath saapeksh arth main vyakt karnaa chahie
 It is not meaningful to say that the balance of payments is favorable, unfavorable and balanced; But it has to be said that the balance of the payment of such country on such date or during such period is favorable, unfavorable or balanced
 bhugtan shesh nikaalane main na keval maal ke aayaat niryaat kaa aadhiky jise 'vyapaar shesh' kehete hai, gyaat kiya jaataa he varan ukt varnit sabhi madon se sakal lendaree or sakal dendaree kaa antar bhi gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The balance of payments is essentially balanced in a continuous sequence of transactions, but the balance of payments of a country to a particular date is found to be favorable or unfavorable
 kisi desh kaa anukool tathaa pratikul bhugtan shesh us desh kii aantarik aarthik sthiti kaa parichaayak mana jaataa he
 If the balance of payments remained favorable, it would mean the abundance of exports by that country, the abundance of production, the strength of industry trade, the earning of foreign exchange, and the increase in the gold reserves of the nation
 iske vipareet pratikul bhugtan shesh kaa arth hoga aayaat kaa bahulya, vyapaar udyog kii shithilataa, utpaadan main giravat, viniyog kaa abhaav, videshi mudra or raashtra ke swarnakosh main kami
 In the present era of planning and development, it has become imperative to import the required quantity of capital goods and skilled experts from developed countries, that the payment should remain favorable in favor of the rest of the country

 It departs from Patna Junction railway station at 06:00 PM and arrives at Guwahati railway station at 10:30 AM

 This circuit uses only diode and capacitor
 saikadon kilovolt kaa vibhavaantar paidaa karne ke liye yah paripath bahutayat main prayog kiya jaataa he
 This circuit is called 'multiplier' because it increases manifold by increasing the low input voltage
 iskaa output disi hota he
 The output voltage will be how many times the input voltage - this depends on the number of multiplier steps used in this circuit
 saamaanya jivan main, computer, internet tathaa chitthon par hindi main vartanee sambandhi anek galtiyaan dekhi jaati hai
 Inaccurate spelling spoils the beauty of the language
 isaliye is lekh main hindi main kii jane vaali saamaanya galatiyon ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 These are inaccuracies that usually occur during typing on computers or other computing devices
 angreji main is prakaar kii ashuddhiyon ko typo kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes the typist does not get attention on them, even when meditating many times he ignores laziness
 ek anya kaaran yah bhi he ki kai baar tipakarta ko prayog kiye ja rahe typing aujaar dwaara vah varna yaa chihn tip karne kaa tarika pataa nahin hota
 This is due to convenience, because of not knowing the right way to type a symbol or due to lack of accessibility to type a particular mark
 computer par tankan ke samay adhiktar log aalasyavash yaa varna ko tip karne kaa tarika na jaanane / sulabh na hone ke kaaran purnaviram ke sthaan par phulstop kaa prayog karte hai
 Using fullstop in place of full stop also affects the beauty of Devanagari and other complications in computing
 hindi main kisi bhi viraam chihn yatha purnaviram, prashnchihn aadi se pehle spes nahin aata
 Nowadays, due to this happening in many printed books, magazines, people start typing the same which is wrong
 kisi bhi viraam chihn se pehle spes nahin aana chaiye
 In English, fullstop is used for compression, in Hindi it is the shortest sign
 praayah yah chihn keyboard par sulabh na hone se log iske sthaan par phulstop kaa hi prayog kar lete hai jabaki vah ashuddh he
 The simplest way to type this symbol is to type its Unicode code 0970 in any word processor and select it and press alt-x, it will be converted to the shortest symbol
 udhaaharan: sahi - dow rajendra prasad, galat - dow rajendra prasad, sahi - ium e, galat - ium
 e
 Due to its resemblance to the Hindi zero mark, many times people mistakenly use the zero digit of Hindi instead of the shortest sign
 inamen antar ye he ki ek to laghav chihn shunya se chota hota he doosraa shunya jahaan kshaitij rup se pankti ke madhya main hota he, laghav chihn kshaitij rup se neeche kii taraf hota he
 Many people, in the lack of information, put two full-lengths in place of the right sign of a double stick written in Sanskrit at the end of shlokas
 sahi chihn daalane hetu yadi aapke typing aujaar main ye chihn na ho to kisi bhi verde prosesar main iske unicode code 0965 ko tip karen tathaa use salact karke alt-x dabaa den, vah dabl dand chihn main badal jaayegaa
 a full stop / sentence is prescribed for sentence-end
 paragraph-ant hetu dabl-dand nirdhaarit he, jiskaa saamanyata kavita / padya main tukbandi ke ant main, kintu prayek paragraph ke ant main dabl dand tip kiya jaae to paath adhik vaigyanik or takneekee rup se parishuddh hoga
 Many times the typers type a colon corresponding to it instead of an immersion, which is completely impure
 maanak hindi keyboard inascript main visarg shift ke saath - kunji dabaakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 As an alternative, type its Unicode code 0903 in any word processor and select it and press alt-x, it will be converted into an immersion symbol
 kai baar tipakarta dashamalav chihn ke sthaan par usase milte julate chihn phulstop ko tip kar dete hai jo ki sarvatha ashuddh he
 If you want to see the difference between these two, then type both in a word processor and make the font size much larger
 dashamalav chihn ke liye Middle Dot kaa prayog kiya janaa chahie jo Numerical Keypad main Del key ke upar he
 Whereas only code is set for Full stop
 panchamaaksharon ke niyam kaa sahi gyaan na hone se bahudhaa log inke aadhe aksharon kii jagah aksar 'n' kaa hi galat prayog karte hai jaise 'pandit' ke sthaan par 'pandit', 'vindos' ke sthaan par 'vindos', 'chanchal' ke sthaan par 'chanchal' aadi
 Most of these impurities are used in place of 'n' and 'n' instead of 'n'
 niyam: varnmaala ke har vyanjan varg ke pehle chaar varnon ke pehle yadi anuswaar kii dhwani ho to us varg kaa paanchava varna aadha hokar lagata he
 That is, half से before the first four letters of the class, half चार before the first four letters of the class, half से before the first four letters of the class, half before the first four letters of the class and half before the first four characters of the class Comes
 udhaaharan: In modern Hindi, only Anusvara is also used for convenience in place of Panchamakshars, although it reduces the beauty of Devanagari
 jaise: pankaj - pankaj, shaanti - shanti, parampara - parampara
 The usage of j and N, in particular, has reduced considerably
 vikipedia kii parampara ke anusaar sanskrit, dharm tathaa bhartiya samskruti sambandhi lekhon main panchamaaksharon kaa prayog hona chaiye jabaki vigyaan, ganit, takanic aadi sambandhi lekhon main saralata hetu aadhunik hindi kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Yes, the title of the article should be kept in the alphabet in terms of pure pronunciation and spelling, irrespective of any subject
 khoj tathaa punarnirdesan hetu aadhunik vartanee vaale naam ko parmparik panchamakshar vaale sheershak par punarnirdeshit kar dena chaiye taaki shuddh uccharan evam vartanee rahe
 For example, the priest should be redirected to the priest
 aagat dhwani "o" athwa isaki maatra ke baad shuddh vartanee kaa prayog hi upyukt he kyonki usamen anuswaar kii bindi dikhaayi nahin detii
 Example - Font is appropriate instead of font
 isi prakaar duusari aagat dhwani "ji" tathaa isaki maatra ke baad bhi anuswaar kii bindi yaa to dikhti nahin yaa chandrabindu kaa bhram hota he atah iske sthaan par bhi shuddh vartanee kaa prayog hi upyukt he
 Example - And is suitable for place of place
 pancham varna kii sandhi se banane vaale sanyuktakshron main baad vaala varna "ji" tathaa "na" ke neeche lagata he
 In this way, most of the Unicode fonts cannot be shown correctly to the conjuncts, which are shown on the left
 sanskrit 2003 naamak unicode font aise sanyuktakshron ko sahi prakaar se pradarshit karata he
 Example - The correct form of Ganga
 lekhan kii galati:'o' tathaa 'ji' ye donon aagat dhvaniyaan kahi jaati hai jo ki hindi main videshi bhashaaon visheshkar angreji se aayi hai
 They are used for two distinct sounds of English
 'o' kii dhwani 'o' tathaa 'ou' ke lagbhag bich kii he, udhaaharan: bos, hot aadi
 Often people write 'sha' instead of 'sha' in general writing and also in computer typing
 aisa do kaarnon se he ek to videshi dhvaniyaan hone se bhartiya kai baar inhen aatmsaat nahin kar pate or doosraa computer par typing aujaar main 'o' kaa chihn sulabh na hone se
 Many a times, people become idle even when they are accessible in typing tools
 haalaanki kuch shabd aise hai jinke hindi main 'aa' vaale rup bhi prachlit hai jaise doctor tathaa kalege 
 In these cases the form of 'aa' also goes on, because their pronunciation of 'aa' is also prevalent, although it is better to write 'a'
 lekin jin shabdon ke uccharan main keval 'o' kii hi dhwani ho unhen 'aa' rup main likhnaa bilkul galat he
 For example, 'blog' is often incorrectly written as 'blog' on the internet, although no one speaks 'blog'
 uccharan kii galati:chunki 'o' videshi dhwani he isaliye kai bhartiya ise aatmsaat nahin kar pate tathaa 'o' vaale shabdon kaa uccharan 'aa' kii tarah karte hai
 For example, 'all' in place of 'all', 'allso' in place of 'allso', 'body' in place of 'body' etc
 aagat dhwani 'ji', 'e' tathaa 'i' ke lagbhag bich kii he, udhaaharan 'jak', 'mak' 
 In Hindi, for this, the nearest letter 'A' is used, like 'jack' instead of 'jack'
 yah itnaa ashuddh nahin lekin 'ji' kii maatra ke sthaan par 'e' kii maatra kaa upyog sarvatha anuchit he tathaa devanagari kii dhvanyaatmakataa gun - uccharan or lekhan kii samarupatha ke viruddh he
 Examples of such misuse are to write 'raid' instead of 'raid' which is Raid's correct writing
 isi prakaar 'test' ke sthaan par 'test' likhnaa jo ki Taste kaa sahi lekhan he, 'gust' ke sthaan par 'guest' jo ki galat he
 Another inaccuracy that is seen in the print media - instead of 'ऍ', the letter 'A' is placed above 'A'
 aisa varna unicode font main bananaa sambhav nahin he lekin non-unicode font main ban jaataa he
 Such a mistake is usually reflected in characters starting with 'ऍ'
 bahudhaa anuswaar ke sthaan par anunasik tathaa anunasik ke sthaan par anuswaar likh diya jaataa he
 In particular, the mistake of writing Anusvara in place of Anunasik is more prevalent and it has also received an unannounced acceptance
 kuch udhaaharan hai, hansanaa ke sthaan par hansnaa, pankh ke sthaan par pankh aadi
 To illustrate the difference between these two, the example of swan and laughter is often given
 anuswaar tathaa anunasik ke upyog sambandhi jaankaree yahan dekhen
 Nukta is used in words taken from Urdu to Hindi
 iske atirikt angreji aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kuch shabdon main bhi nukte kaa upyog hota he
 Nukta reveals the correct sound of a particular language, but when writing in Hindi, many times people omit Nukta
 yadhyapi ise gambheer galati nahin mana jaataa
 Special notice is not given to leave nukta but it seems strange to place it where nukta is not done, like 'fruit' instead of 'fruit' and 'fir' instead of 'fir' is completely wrong
 bevajaah nukta lagane kaa ek kaaran typing sambandhi bhi he
 For example, while typing with a tool called Barah Aimai, pressing 'F' key prints 'F' while 'F' requires pressing 'P + H'
 isaliye kai log aalasyavash 'F' dwaara 'pha' likhane ko hi aadat bana lete hai
 Nukta can also be unavoidable at times
 ek udhaaharan dekhen: angreji ke varna 'G' kaa uccharan he 'ji', tathaa 'Z' kaa uccharan he 'zee'
 The difference between the pronunciation of these two cannot be clear without the nukes
 ek anya suzav yah diya jaataa he ki jahaan arth badalane kii ashanka ho, vahiin nukta jaise veikshiptikaarak kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Where the meaning of the tip can be understood correctly, the work should be done without the tip
 nukte ke bare main ek saamaanya niyam yaad rakhaa janaa chaiye - haan par nukte ke prayog ke vishay main shankaa ho, vahaan nukte kaa prayog na karen
 'necessity' will go in place of 'need', but not 'compulsion' in place of 'compulsion'
 nukte ke sahi prayog hetu yah lekh dekhen
 There are many words in Hindi whose spelling is usually misspelled
 ye vartaniyaan print media main maujuud hone se aam aadmi inhen hi sahi samajhane lagata he
 The main article above lists such words
 k --> kai, kha --> khi aadi Many people also pronounce 'sh' and 'sh' like 's', like saying 'english' to 'english', 'conspiracy' to 'sadhyantra' etc
 'ri' kaa uttar bharat main uccharan 'ri' kii tarah tathaa dakshin bharat main 'ru' kii tarah hota he
 Its correct pronunciation is lost in chronology
 'jna' kaa bharat ke vibhinn hisson main uccharan bhinn-bhinn tareeke se hota he, uttar bharat ke hindi bhashaa kshetron main praayah iskaa uccharan 'gy' kii tarah kiya jaataa he
 Its correct pronunciation has also disappeared
 aajkal 'ksha' kaa uccharan 'chha' kii tarah aam taur par sunne ko miltaa he jaise 'kshatriya' ko 'chhatriy' bolnaa
 Often people unfamiliar with Panchamakshar pronounce 'ङ' as' ''
 kuch log kuch shabdon main aane vaale aadhe aksharon kaa puure aksharon kii tarah uccharan karte hai
 For example, the pronunciation of 'question' is like 'question', 'importance' is pronounced like 'mahtava', 'attempt' is pronounced as 'effort'
 kai aise shabd hai jinka arth to kuch or tha lekin ve galat arth samajhe jane se bhinn arth main prayukt hone lage hai
 For example, khilafat means "the office of the caliphate and its authority", but the general public, including educated journalists, is using Khilafat in the same sense as a proclamation
 mahad vagthi, ghat tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he

 ‘shakti’ evam ‘satta’ kii avadharana samajashaastra, raajnneetik samajashaastra or raajnneeti shaastra kii mul avadharana he
 This concept has incomparable importance in understanding the public and political behavior of humans
 yadhyapi in donon kaa prayog paryaayavachi kii tarah kiya jaataa he par raajnneetik samajashaastra main inkaa vishisht arth he
 In every political system, power is concentrated only among a few people or minority groups
 yah kis prakaar hota he? raajnneetik samajashaastra main in prashn kaa uttar dhundne ke prayaason ke parinaam-swaroop hi abhijan sambandhi siddhanton kaa vikaas hua he
 Aristocratic principles are based on the fact that there are broadly two distinct classes in each society - one, a class of minorities or minorities who, by virtue of their ability, give the supreme leadership and rule to the society, and the other, People-group or class of innumerable common people, whose fate is written to be governed
 pratham varg ko abhijan varg or duusare ko jansamooh kaha jaataa he
 The concept of aristocracy was first seen only from the political point of view and attention was paid only to the ruling class and powerful elite, but today it is not so
 aaj abhijanon main shaktishaalee abhijan varg, poonjipati varg, sainik abhijan, shaasha-varg, buddhijivi varg, naukarshahon tathaa prabandhakon ko bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 In addition to the uneven distribution of power, studies of social stratification have also contributed significantly to the development of elite theories
 aaj abhijan kaa sanpratyay raajnneeti shaastra, samajashaastra evam raajnneetik samajashaastra main ek moulik sanpratyay mana jaataa he
 This theory is very important in understanding socio-political reality because some kind of social, political, economic stratification is found in every society
 abhijan shabd kaa prayog satrahavin shatabdi me vishesh evam sabase uttam vastuon athwa gunon ke liye kiya jaataa tha is arth main yah shabd vajra crack sainik daston athwa abhijaat varg jaise ucch str ke vyaktiyon ke liye prayuktt hota tha
 The term was not widely used in social and political writings until the end of the nineteenth century
 beesvin shatabdi main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke pashchaat pashchimi deshon evam america main abhijan kii avadharana evam iske siddhanth kaaphi lokapriy hue tathaa tabhi se abhijan kii avadharana vyapak rup se saamaajik vigyaan main prayukt kii jane lagi
 such as Pareto, Mosca, C
 Wright Mills, Edward Shils, Shumpeter, Roberta Mitchells, James Burnham, Raymond Aron, Carl Manheim, Harold Laswell, etc
 are associated with the elitist principles
 yahan par katipay pramukh vidwaanon ke vichaaron kaa sankshipt vivechan hi samuchit hoga
 Wilfredo Pareto defines eligibility as saying that in every specific human action, if we give marks to the indicators of the area of the person's activities, then the person who gets the highest score is called elation
 duusare shabdon main, abhijanon main un sabhi safal vyaktiyon ko sammilit kiya jaataa he jo prayek gatividhi main or samaaj ke prayek str par sarvocch hote hai
 In his words, if a class is made of those people who get the highest marks in the field of any specific human activity, then they can name that class as elite
 gitaano moska pratham vidwaan hai jinhone ‘abhijan’ tathaa ‘jansamooh’ shabdon kaa prayog vishisht artho main kiya he
 In his words, in all societies, from societies which have developed very little and which have not yet been able to properly touch the first rays of civilization, even those societies which are the most developed and powerful, in all societies There are only two types of people
 ek, us varg ke log jo shashan karte hai or duusare, jin par shashan kiya jaataa he pehle varg ke log alpsankhyak hote hue bhi sabhi prakaar ke raajnneetik kaaryon kaa niyantran apane haathon main rakhte hai, sari satta unke haathon main kendrit hoti he tathaa satta ke laabhon kaa ras bhi unhen hi miltaa he, jabaki doosraa varg bahusankhyak hote hue bhi pratham varg dwaara kabhi vaid tareekon se or kabhi adhik yaa kam maatra main swechhachari evam hinsak tareekon se nirdeshit va niyantrit rahata he
 According to Mosca, in all types of governance, control is always in the hands of the elite
 saath hi shaasha varg main koi na koi aisa gun hota he jiske kaaran vah samaaj main sammanit evam prabhaavshaalee mana jaataa he, bhale hi ve gun yatharth hon athwa mahaj dikhaave maatr ke rup main hi bache hon
 Harold D
 Lasswell has paid special attention to political elite
 inke shabdon main raajnneetik abhijanon main raajnneetik nikaay ke sattadhariyon kaa samavesh hota he
 Those in power also include the leadership and social structure in which leaders emerge and to which they are responsible for a certain period
 remand es ne bhi laswell ke samaan abhijan varg ko mukhyatah shaasha varg hi mana he jo alp-sankhya main hota he
 They have tried to establish a relationship between the elite and other social classes and have discussed the social impact of intellectual elite who are not part of the system of political power
 tii0bi0 botomor ne uparyukt vidwaanon ke vichaaron se is aadhaar par asahmati prakat kii he ki unhone abhijan ke siddhanth main nihit vichaardhaara kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya he
 According to Bottomor, the concept of eligibility has developed in opposition to the importance of democracy
 inke anusaar ‘aaj abhijan shabd kaa prayog aamtaur par vastutah un prakaaryaatmak, mukhyatah vyavsaayik samoohon ke liye kiya jane laga he jinako samaaj main ucch sthaan praapt he
 In his view, the term new generation sociologists have used the term elite for more small and more organized groups which may be more or less related to the mutually united social classes
 batomor ke vichaar main remand eran hi ek maatr vidwaan hai jinhone abhijan varg main sambandh kaa adhyayan kiya he tathaa yah bataane kii cheshtaa kii he ki virgo ke unmoolan se saamaajik starikaran, abhijanon kaa nirmaan evam rajnatik satta kii vishmataaon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga
 In other words, the existence of the elite will remain in every type of society and political system
 uparyukt vivechan se spasht hota he ki abhijan kii koi ek sarvamaanya paribhaasha nahin hai tathaa saamanytah sambhraatajanon main un vyaktiyon ko sammilit kiya jaataa he jo saamaajik, aarthik tathaa raajnneetik drushti se anya vyaktiyon arthath jan saadhaaran kii apeksha ucch sthiti rakhte hai is vivechan se hamen pataa chalata he ki sambhratajan vividh prakaar ke hai jaise ki shaasha varg, shaktishaalee sambhrantjan, buddhijivi varg, prabandhak, naukarshah tathaa sainik adhikari ityadi
 Dr
 Prafulla Chandra Rai was a great chemist, entrepreneur and great teacher of India

 Impressed by his multi-faceted personality of 'simple living high thoughts', Mahatma Gandhi had said, "seeing this simple man in pure Indian attire does not believe that he can be a great scientist

 When you opposed this injustice to the then English director of the Education Department, he satirized that "if you are such a qualified chemist, why not run a business?" The effect of these sharp words was that Rai later started the work of Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Curves in 1892 with a small capital of 800 rupees, in his living room, to prepare luxurious medicines
 Tax has become a factory worth crores of rupees today and has led to the introduction of other such industries in the country

 Part of a category on Sikhism khalsa sikh dharm ke vidhiwat dikshaprapt anuyaayiyon samuhik rup he
 The Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh ji in Anandpur Sahib on the day of Baisakhi on 1699
 is din unhone sarvapratham paanch pyaaron ko amritpan karvaa kar khalsa banaaya tathaa tatpashchaat un paanch pyaaron ke haathon se swayan bhi amritpan kiya
 Satguru Gobind Singh has honored Khalsa with the status of "kaal Purakh ki Army" in Khalsa glory
 talwaar or kesh to pehle hi sikhon ke paas the, guru gobind singh ne "khande bate kii pahul" tayar kar kacha, kadaa or kangha bhi diya
 On the same day, "singh" was put behind the name of Khalse
 shaareerik dekh main khalse kii bhinta najar aane lagi
 But the Khalsa did not give up self-knowledge, his propaganda continued and the sword also continued when needed
 sikh dharm ke upar anya dharmon or sarkari numaayindo ke waar lagaataar bad gaye the
 By giving false news to the government, staunch followers of Islam got Guru Arjun Dev ji sentenced to death
 jab guru arjuna dev, ko bahut dukh de kar shahid kar diya gaya to guru hargobind ji ne talwaar uthaa lee
 This sword was raised only for self-defense and for the betterment of the general public
 guru hargobind ji ke jivan main un par lagaataar 4 hamale hue or satguru hari raae par bhi ek hamalaa hua
 Guru Hari Krishna also tried to make emperor Aurangzeb his follower
 guru teg bahadur ko sarkaar ne maut ke ghat utaar diya, kyonki wo hindu brahminon ke dukhon ko dekh kar sarkaar se apil karne gaye the
 After that, the government clergy started considering the increasing propaganda of Gurmat and the huge number of followers as a threat to their religion and they united against it
 is bich guru gobind singh ne kuch baniyon kii rachana kii jis main islam ke khilaaf sakht tippaniyan thi
 In view of the above circumstances and the oppressive behavior of Aurangzeb and his nominees towards the non-muslim people, when Guru Gobind Singh decided to wage an armed struggle to protect the religion, he looked for the Sikhs who pursue the Gurmat ideology, help the miseries
 Do and do not back down in the sacrifice of your sacrifice when you need it
 jab koi dharm aage badhata he to uske bahut aam dikhta he ki uske anuyaayi bahut hai, zyaadaatar to dekha-dekhi ho jate hai, kuch shardha main ho jate hai, kuch apane khudgarji ke kaaran ho jate hai, asal anuyaayi to hote hi gine chune hai
 Evidence of this was found in Anandpur
 jab satgur gobind singh ne talwaar nikal kar kaha kii ""unhen ek sir chaiye"" | sab hakke bakke rah gaye | kuch to maukey se hi khisak gaye | kuch kehane lag pade guru pagal ho gaya he | kuch tamaasha dekhne aae the | kuch mata gujri ke paas bhaag gaye kii dekho tumharaa saputra kya khichdi pakaa rahaa he | Bhai Daya Singh ji was the first hand in the crowd of 10 thousand
 Behind the Gurmat ideology, he had the ability to behead
 Guru Sahib took him to the tent
 There was a goat neck cut
 Blood appeared to come out of the tent
 Fear increased in public
 Even then, by showing snow, Dharam Singh, Himmat Singh, Mohkam Singh, Sahib Singh accepted to cut their sis
 Guru Sahib kept goatting
 paanchon ko phir tamboo se bahar niklaa or khande bate kii pahul tayar kii | Khanda Bata is composed of Jantra mantras and tantras smelled
 isko pehali baar satgur gobind singh ne banaaya tha
 The water prepared by this method is called "pahul"
 aam bhashaa main ise log amrit bhi kehete hai
 By drinking this, the Sikh becomes a part of the Khalsa Army, that is, he has now surrendered his body and wealth to God, now he will only proclaim the truth and if the need arises, he will not back down from cutting his throat
 sab vikaron se dur rahegaa
 Such a Sikh is also called Amritdhari
 yah pahul paanchon ko pilaai gai or unhen paanch pyaaron ke kitaab se niwaja
 2 Kakkar was already in Sikhism
 jahaan sikh atmik satl par sab se bheen samaj rakhata tha satgur gobind singh ji ne un do kakaron ke saath saath kangha, kadaa or kacha de kar shaareerik dekh main bhi khalse ko bhinn kar diya
 Today, Khande Bate's Pahul prepares only five beloved
 yah prikriya aaj rivaaj ban gayi he
 Today the test is not taken as it was
 is prikriya ko amrit sanchaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 History is a witness to the fact that Guru Gobind Singh ji also used to run under five love and obeyed his orders
 paanch pyaaron ne gobind singh ko chamkor kaa kila chhodane kaa hukum diya or unhen maananaa padaa
 The five loves then interrupted Gobind Singh ji, while Gobind Singh was greeting Dadu's tomb to examine these
 gobind singh ne banda bahadur ko bhi paanch pyaaron ke sang bheja gaya, itihaas main zikr he ki jab banda bahadur pyaaron kii ulanghnaa karata rahaa to banda bahadur ko sab kile main chhod gaye
 Gobind Singh and the Khalsa army helped Bahadur Shah and also took iron from his brother to make him the ruler
 khalsa ne hi guru gobind singh kii baniyon ko khoja or granth ke rup main dhaala

 Prior to Charles Darwin's book, "origin of Species", the simple assumption was that all living beings have been created by some divine power and their number, form and shape have always been fixed
 parantu ukt pustak ke prakaashan ke pashchaat vikaswad ne is dharna kaa sthaan grahan kar liya or phir anya jantuon kii bhanti manushya ke liye bhi yah prashn saadharantaya poocha jane laga ki uskaa vikaas kab or kis jantu athwa jantusamooh se hua

 Although Darwin could not solve the question of human development, he drew the attention of zoologists to two deep facts: maanavaakar copi hi manushya ke purvajon ke sambandhi ho sakate hai or There is a huge gap between the development of human bodies and human beings, which can be reduced only by searching for the missing fossils

 All human fossils are derived from different levels of geology

 These levels are formed by the flow of water from the soil and sand, and after long periods of sedimentation
 in staron main jo bhi jeev fas gaye, wo bhi shilabhoot ho gaye
 Such inscribed remains are called fossils
 jeevashmon kii aayu swayan un staron kii, jinamein ve paae jate hai, aayu ke baraabar hoti he
 Knowing the age of the strata, geologists have prepared a metamorphic table, according to which the rock groups are divided into 5 large blocks or Mahakalpas: in mahakalpon ko kalpon main vibhajit kiya gaya he tathaa prayek kalp ek kalvishesh main paae janevaale staron kii aayu ke baraabar hota he
 Thus the primitive Mahakalpa is a "pre-cambrian", archaic Mahakalpa six 'cambrian', Ordovision ,, Silurian, Divoni, Carboni and Permian, Medieval Mahakalpa three Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous and Newtanic Mahakalpa Five Adinutan, mino-newan, Meditation, Ataxia Nutans are divided into kalpas

 Propylopithecus - Propylopithecus has also been detected by a jaw derived from the Egyptian underworld era
 anumaanath: yah chote gibbon ke baraabar tha or maanavaakar kii disha main parapithicas se ek pag aage tha
 Although both the above mentioned fossils do not throw much light on human development due to being in the form of jaws only, yet they do make sense of the following two things: alpanutanyug jaise puraatan kaal main hi maanavaakar copi upasthit the tathaa The development of human body has passed through primates like Tarsier without monkeys
 vanar maanavaakar kapiyon se aadya maane jate hai, atev manushya kii vikaas shrinkhalaa main vanar avasthaa kaa anupasthit hona aashaa ke pratikul sa jaan padataa he; parantu uparyukt jeevashm atyant aadya hote hue bhi vaanron ke koi lakshan nahin prastut karte, apitu unamem maanavaakar kapiyon ke gun praapt hote hai
 Dryopithicus - The medieval era of Dryopithicus has been found in many parts of the ancient world
 iske charvnak ke charvan dharaatal kii pratikruti gibbon, brihat copi or manushya main bhi pai jaati he, jisase yah anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki dryopithicas sambhavat: manushya sahit sabhi maanavaakar kapiyon ke saamaanya purvaj the
 Limnopithecus - a fossil found in the medieval epochs of eastern Africa is very similar to the present Gibbon
 gibbon kii bhanti iske radanak danta lambey the or bahu yadhyapi apekshaakrit chote the, phir bhi vaanron ke anupaat main lambey the
 Therefore, they can be called between apes and human form
 praconsal --proconsal kaa jeevashm kenya main praarambhik madhyanutan yug ke staron se praapt kiya gaya
 Their face was like apes, but the dental replica was like human cups
 nitambastiyon se inke thalgami hone kaa bhaas hota he
 Probably these would have been ancestors of the Vanmanush and the Gorilla
 madhyanutan yug ke kapiyon main keval dryopithicas ko hi maanav vikaas kii disha kii ore agrasar kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki iske daanton ke dantagro kaa praturup yadhyapi vartmaan manushya main nahin, to unamem avashya paaya jaataa he jo vartmaan manushya ke purvaj samajhe jate hai
 If there is a slight skepticism in this truth, then that the crypts of Dryopithicus are much longer than humans and such long crystals are not possible in the ancestor of man and man
 sach to yah he ki madhyanutan yug ke staron main paae janevaale sabhi jeevashmon main radanak lambey, nukile or nikle hue hai, jo maanavvikas kaa lakshan nahin he
 Oryopithicus - Fossilis of Oeropithicus were obtained from the ultra-modern levels of the coal mines of Tuscany in Italy
 iskaa chota munh, hraasmaan radanak tathaa jabadon kaa aakaar vaanron se dur or maanavaakar kapiyon ke sameep tha
 In the design of its teeth, it was like a human being
 yadhyapi isaki nitambasthiyaan vanar ke samaan thim, tathaapi merudand kii agrim kasherukaon kii banaavat se uske khadey hokar chalane kaa sanket miltaa he
 Therefore, if the above conjecture is correct, we get the first darshan of the early human beings of nutan-jeeva-mahakalpa in Oreopithikus
 australlopithicas --1924 idri main remand dart ko dakshini africa ke togs naamak sthaan se kai aisi khopadiyaan praapt huin jo maanavaakar thim
 Dart named him Astralopithicus
 australlopithicas kaa arth he, dakshin main paaya janevaala copi, atev iskaa australiya desh se koi sambandh nahin he
 Robert Broome obtained other fossils of Australopithecus from the earliest extraterrestrial age in 1936 in South Africa from a place called Starkfontein
 aadya maanav ke sabhi jeevashm isi yug se praapt kiye gaye hai, atev ise maanav vikaas kaa yug kaha jaataa he
 The fossil of Astralopithicus was more human than all other fossils of this era
 yahan tak ki iske kuch lakshan manushya se bhi milte the; udaahranarth, khopadi kii merudand par agrim sthiti, lalaat kaa golakaar hona, bhun-asthiyon ke baari hote hue bhi ubhaar kaa na hona, jabade kii akruti, krintakon kaa chota tathaa kam nukila hona, kuulhe kii ilium naamak asthi kaa chaudaa hona tathaa anya bahut se gunon main australlopithicas manushya ke itane nikat tha ki use maanav parivaar, "hominidi", main samavisht karnaa swaabhaavik ho jaataa he
 In the volume of Kapalguha, he was definitely backward than human beings, and those who have a strong opinion give this importance to the person, but whoever will be the ancestor of man, his skull cavity will be less than the present man
 australopicas main yah baat mahatv kii he ki uski kapaalguha kaa aaytan manushya se kam hote hue bhi vartmaan maanavaakar kapiyon se adhik tha
 Yet there is a doubt in Australopithicus being the ancestor of man and that is that of the era
 yah sarvavidit he ki jis yug main australlopithicas tha, usamen usase adhik viksit maanav upasthit the
 Therefore, to be an ancestor of humans, the presence of Australopithecus should have been earlier
 homohabillis --purvi africa ke tanganyika sthaan se homohabillis naamak kuch viksit maanav akruti kaa jeevashm praapt hua
 Its inventors were Elder as well as Byrke, Pied by Tobias and JR Napier
 is maanav kii lambaai 4 foot or haath adhik viksit the, jo upkaran or jhopadi bana sakane kii uski kshamta kii ore sanket karata he
 Its volume of Kapalguha is about 680 cubic cm
 pithicanthropus yaa java kaa maanav—sena ke sarjan dadri ugine dubwa ko apane vidhyaarthee kaal se hi yah vishwaas tha ki manushya kaa janmasthan asia main sambhavat: java main tha
 To confirm his belief, he went to Java and obtained some bones from the rocks of the very late age, which he described as Pithyanthropus in 1894
 is jeevashm kii kapaalguha 900 ghan senmi thi, jo australlopithicas se adhik or manushya se kuch hi kam thi
 There is also the feeling of walking upright from the thigh bone
 sinenthropus yaa china kaa maanav--china main peking se lagbhag 40 mile dakshin pashchim kii ore chaookutim naamak gaanv ke, atyantnutan yug ke, madhyavarti staron se ek or maanav jeevashm 1927 idri main praapt hua, jise sinenthropus kaha gaya
 Because of the extreme similarities between humans in Java and China, the other is considered to be an earlier race and is often named Pithyanthopus pikinesensis
 is maanav kii kapaalguha manushya ke samaan thi tathaa iske jeevashmon ke saath pathar ke anek aujaar praapt hue
 It shows the prevalence of industries in them
 aasapaas koyale ke kan praapt hone se unke agniprayogi, tathaa kai lambii haddiyon kii chiri dasha main paae jane se unke maanav bhakshi hone kaa sanket miltaa he
 Heidelberg Man - In 1907, in Germany, a place called Heidelberg in Germany received a jaw from the earliest stages of the Age of Atonement, whose teeth were similar to those of present-day humans
 thudi kaa abhaav tha, at: spasht he ki yah purnat: manushya nahin ban paaya tha
 Swanscomb Man - In 1935 and 36, Older Marston received two bones of the human cranial wall in a place called Swanscomb, England
 yadhyapi in asthiyon kii motaai manushya kii bhittikasthi se adhik thi, tathaapi kapaalguha kaa aaytan lagbhag 1,300 ghan senmi ho gaya tha
 It is also inferred from the mold of the cavity that the transformation of the surface of the brain was very similar to that of humans
 stenhim maanav --san 1933 main germany ke stenhim naamak sthaan main ek purna khopadi praapt hui jiskaa kaal swanskomb maanav ke samaan tha
 By composition it appears to be the link between Pithyanthropus and man
 iskaa kapaalguha kaa aaytan 1,000 ghan senmidru, bhun kii asthi ghatit tathaa jabade bahut kuch manushya jaise the
 Neanderthal humans - In 1856, a human fossil was found in a place called Johann Karl Fülerotte, named Neanderthal humans
 baad main lagbhag 100 aise hi jeevashm sansar ke anya bhaagon main mili
 Although there is no longer any doubt about Nirderdhaal being human, there is still a feeling of pushiness from its face resembling bones - the eyebrow bones were raised, the jaws were large and the chin was lacking
 isamen kuch aise bhi gun the jo vartmaan manushya ke nahin milte, jaise kapaalguha ke aaytan kaa 1,600 ghan senmidru hona or charvan danta guhika kaa bahut bada hona
 Not only this, his buttocks were thick, crooked and unformed, which makes him feel like stuttering
 atev ek ore jahaan isamen manushya ke anek gun the, to duusari ore kai badi bhinnataayen bhi thim
 Therefore, Neanderthal can be considered a human being only an ardent subdivision of the main branch of human development
 antim himyug main is maanav ke avasheshon kaa na milanaa yah sanket karata he ki manushya ke aagaman par yaa to ye nasht kar die gaye, yaa sankaran dwaara usee ke parivaar main villin ho gaye
 Neanderthal humans were far ahead of all humans in the social system
 inamen apane mritkon ko gaadne kii pratha thi ore inke aujaar ucchtam the
 Other African and Asian humans, similar to Neanderthal - received human skulls from northern Rhodesia in 1921, near the Solo River in Java in 1931–32, and from Saldanha, Africa, in 1953, respectively, from Rhodesia, Sola and Saldanha
 They give the name of humans
 ye sabhi maanav apane adhikansh lakshanon main nienderthal maanav sadrush the, yadhyapi kapalgaha ke aaytan main ve nienderthal se kam, arthath manushya sadrush, hi the
 The above achievements suggest that the expansion of Neanderthal mankind was widespread
 chromagnon maanav tha aadhunik maanav—dakshini france main chromagnon naamak sthaan se vartmaan manushya ke nikatatam purvajon ke jeevashm praapt hue hai
 These are called chromagnon humans, or "modern humans"
 inaki asthiyon se na keval inke lambey, sudaul, sudrudh or budhimaan hone kaa abhas hota he, varan vartmaan europea jatiyon se inhen pruthak kar sakna atyant kathin ho jaataa he
 Painting was on the rise in them
 homohabillis ke sah aavishkarta jon nepier ke matanusaar manushya kaa vikaas poch avasthaaon se hokar gujara he : The earliest primitives are known by fossils of Kinyapithecus and Ramapithecus
 ye maanav sambhavat: manushya ke vikaas ke ati praarambhik avasthaaon main the
 The latter pre-human, represents the Australopithecus derived from Africa, praarambhik manushya ko africa se hi praapt homoihabillis dwaara janaa jaataa he, Responsible humans include homoirectas, or humans from Java and China, and aadhunik maanav / homo sepions, kaa pratham udhaaharan chromagnon maanav main praapt hota he
 2 million years ago in modern human Africa, all ancestors were Africans
 homo iractus ke baad vikaas do shakhaon main vibhakt ho gaya
 The Neanderthal of the first branch came to an end in humans, and the second branch, Chromagnon, has passed through the human condition to reach the present humans
 sampurna maanav vikaas mastishk kii vruddhi par hi kendrit he
 Although brain growth also occurred in many other mammal groups of the breasts, for some unknown reasons, this increase was highest among primates
 sambhavat: unka vrikshiya jivan mastishk kii vruddhi ke anya kaarnon main se ek ho saktaa he
 Just as the development of the human body is studied by the above mentioned fossils, similarly the development of their civilization can be studied by the Karanas left by different humans
 ye aujaar maanav jeevashm ke saath, yaa aas paas, paae gaye hai or maanav-mastishk ke vikaas ke saath inamen bhi vikaas hua he
 The initial tools were just coarse and stone pieces, but later they became strong and useful
 ye aujaar keval atyantnutan yug main hi milte he, atev inke kaal kaa gyaan un himandi kalpon se bhi lagaaya jaataa he jo is yug main pad chuke hai
 Instruments found at different times give the name of an industry
 yah naam kisi europea sthaan ke naam par aadhaarit he
 On the basis of the tool industry, we can divide the very modern era into three periods: puraprastar kaal, madhyaprasthar kaal tathaa navaprasthar kaal
 You can divide the old age period into four other periods
 praarambhik kaal--atyantnutan yug ke prarambh main jo aujaar praapt hote hai, ve pattharon ke bhonde tukdon ke rup main hai
 It often seems suspicious that they must have been fabricated by humans
 nichalaa kaal--is kaal main nimnlikhit udyog paae gaye hai : These stone remains, probably man-made, of the most modern era were found in the state of Kent, England
 madhya kaal--is kaal kaa udyog is prakaar he : The Moisterian Industry - This industry spanned from the third glacial eon to the last, ie the fourth glacial eon
 is udyog main hast kulhadiyon kaa sthaan anya aujaaron ne le liya tha, jo pattharon ke bade bade chippad utaar kar bade kaushal se banaae jate the
 This industry period is considered to be a period of time
 uttar kaal--yah kaal antim himandeey kalp ke antim charan main paaya jaataa he
 This includes the following industries: antim himandeep kalp ke ant hone yaa garam jalwaayu ke waapas aane tak ke kaal ko madhyaprasthar kaal kaha jaataa he
 This is called the short term era
 is samay tak manushya sabhy ho chalaa tha
 Although agriculture and animal husbandry had not yet started and humans still roamed around and hunted animals
 sheetkaal main paae janevaale adhikansh jantu is kaal main yaa to nasht ho gaye the, yaa pravaas kar gaye the
 The first humans to come to America were from this era
 pathar ke aujaar sookshm tathaa vicitra aakaar ke the
 This is the last and present era
 pathar ke aujaar yadhyapi is yug main bhi banaae jate the, parantu krishi or pashupaalan is yug kii vishesh ghatnaayen thim
 Earthenware was made to hold grains, whose age can be easily gauged by the difference in their texture and proportion of their parts
 boar, gaay, bhed or bakrii kaa paalan prarambh ho chukaa tha
 The beginning of this era is not known definitively, but it is certain that before 4,000 years BC this era was well established

 yadhyapi brihat kapiyon or manushya main anek samantaayein avashya pai jaati hai, phir bhi inhen manushya kaa purvaj kahana sarvatha trutipurna hoga, kyonki jahaan manushya tathaa in kapiyon main samantaayein milti hai, vahaan unamem or purv vaanron main bhi kuch miltaa hai
 Not only this, Brihat Kapi is more special than human in its many qualities
 atev ham samaantaaon ke aadhaar par keval itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki brihat copi or manushya ke purvaj pracheen kaal main ek rahe honge
 The special qualities which encouraged the development of man are the following: khadey hokar chalanaa - yadhyapi kuch brihat copi bhi bahudhaa khadey ho lete hai, parantu swabhaavat: khadaa hokar chalanevaala keval manushya hi he
 As a result of this quality, human hands become free for other tasks
 khadey hokar chalane ke liye uski asthiyon kii banaavat or sthiti aantarik angon kii sthitiyon main pher badal hue
 Significant changes occurred in the bones of the foot
 angutha anya ungliyon kii sidh main aa gaya tathaa pairon ne chapakar hokar thal par chalane or daudane kii vishesh kshamta praapt kar lee

 Sammukh Angushta - Sammukh Angustha means to be brought in the unfavorable position of other fingers
 is sthiti main angushth anya ungaliyon ke saamne aakar or saath milakar vastuon main pakad sakane main safal ho paata he
 This quality started in the animal group only in the primate ganas, by bringing the mouth of the objects to test and it developed so much in humans that today man's hand has become a very sensitive and sensitive device
 aise haath kii sahaayta se manushya apni maansik shaktiyon ko kaary rup sristi kaa sabase pratibhashali praani ban paane main safal hua he
 To say that only the front limb has contributed to the enrichment of the human mind will be exaggerated
 is prakaar vikaas kii disha main jo pehla parivartan manushya main hua vah pratham pairon par sidhaa khadey hone ke liye tathaa dwitiya haathon se vastuon ko bhalee prakaar pakad sakane ke liye rahaa hoga

 The appearance of the inner part of the lips, the folds of the earlobes, the lack of hair on the entire body, the tinnitus of the teeth, are other qualities that move a man away from the body
 spasht he ki mastishk kii vruddhi par hi manushya ke sampurna vikaas kaa bal rahaa he
 It is difficult to say whether this growth is still taking place or not, but on the basis of what has been developed, comparative conclusions can be drawn from the development of human and extinct reptiles
 lupt sarisrupon kaa sharir bhimkaay ho gaya tha
 As a result, the relatively small brain could not meet the requirements of the larger body and these animals gradually disappeared
 iske pratikul manushya main sharir ke anupaat main apekshaakrit mastishk kahin bada ho gaya he, atev manushya ke mastishk kii adhikansh shakti shaareerik aavashyaktaaon ko puraa kar lene ke baad bhi shesh rah jaati he
