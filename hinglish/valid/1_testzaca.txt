 Clear records of the appearance of this comet were recorded by the Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European rulers, but at that time it was not identified as a recurring comet

 For example, we now understand that the surface of the heli is largely made up of dust and non-volatile materials and only a small part of it is made up of ice or volatile matter

 Aristotle's belief on the nature of comets was the consensus among the then philosophers that comets were the result of disturbances in the Earth's atmosphere

 Tycho used parallax measurements to show that comets exist beyond the moon

 In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Principia, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion
 dhoomaketu par unka kaam nishchit rup se adhuraa tha haalanki unhen shankaa thi ki san 1680 or 1681 main pehle dikhne vaala or surya ke peeche se guzar jane ke baad dikhaai dene vaala dhumaketu ek hi tha
 His belief was later found to be correct

 Finally, in 1705 in his Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, Newton's friend, editor and publisher Edmund Haley used Newton's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on comet orbits

 The Halley Comet return prediction proved to be correct

 heley, 200 varsh yaa usase kam kakshiya avadhi ke saath ek aavarti yaa laghu-avadhi dhoomaketu ke rup main vargeekrut he
 In contrast, long-term comets complete their orbits in thousands of years
 aavarti dhoomaketuon kaa krantivrutt se ausat jhukaav keval 10 degree he or isaki ausat kakshiya avadhi sirf 6

 Thus Hailey's orbit is somewhat nontrivial

 Like Halley, the recurring comets whose orbital period is between 20 and 200 years and whose inclination from the ecliptic extend from 0 ° to 90 ° or more are called 'heli-type comets'
 aaj din tak pahachaane gaye kariban 400 brihaspati parivaar dhoomaketuon main se keval 54 heley- tip dhoomaketu hi awalokit kiye ja sake he
 Looking at the orbits of heli-type comets, it seems that they were originally long-term comets whose orbits were affected by the gravitation of giant planets as well as directed into the inner solar system

 Time too quickly turns social into historical and historical to mythological
 phir bhi is naatak kii saamagree-kaccha masala-itihaas se batori gai he
 a weak basis of history is definitely taken
 par, iske aage naatak kaa itihaas se koi sambandh nahin he
 And this raw spice is also taken from history in the same way as it is taken from contemporary life-situations
 maharashtra main peshwaon kaa raaj tha, naanaa fadanvis peshwa ke pradhan the, koi ek ghasiram tha, brahman the, maratha sardaar the or ve sab ikaiyaan apane-apane daayre main bandhi samay ke pravaah main lakdi ke latthe kii bhanti kabhi satakar to kabhi hatakar, kabhi paraspar ko chooti to kabhi takaraati apratihat pravaahit ho rahi thim
 It may be the job of a person who researches history, not the playwright, to investigate whether his work was appropriate or improper or his basic existence was meaningful
 main isi kaaran ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ko anaitihaasik naatak maanata hoon
 'ghasiram Kotwal' is a legend, a legend, a legend
 or dantakatha kaa ek apana rachana-vidhaan hota he: jhine yatharth ko jab ham apni naitikta se ranjit kar kalpana kii sahaayta se punarujjivit karte hai to ek dantakatha ban jaati he
 There is also a story of gossip and if there is a sight to behold then it is a dahik experience daahak anubhav hi rachanaatmak sahitya ban paata he, isamen koi sandeh nahin he
 But what is a legend and how is it, what matters more is how we take it, because then we do our investigation
 jaahir he ki yahi kaam sabase mushkil hota he, ek gahari chunauti he vah
 To accept it is to show our literature-loyalty
 meri nigaah main ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ek vishisht samaaj-sthiti kii ore sanket karata he
 That social condition is neither old nor new
 na vah kisi bhugolic seemaa-rekha main bandhi he, na samay se hi
 That place is timeless, so 'ghasiram' and 'nana Phadnavis' are also place-timeless
 samaaj-sthitiyaan unhen janm detii hai, detii rahengi
 The playwright of any era will not be able to remain untouched by them
 apni prakruti ke anusaar vah kabhi bhavy-bheeshan rup dekar unhen manch par utaaregaa to kabhi nrity-sangitamay banaakar prastut karegaa
 i have deliberately adopted another method
 lokanaty kaa lacheelaapan vikhyath he or dantakatha ke prastutikaran ke liye sabase adhik upyogi he
 In it, a character emerges as a representative of a specific mindset and that attitude is very direct and complete and unmatched
 satahi sanshlishtataa ke rahete hue bhi vah aam darshak ke saamne baraabar ujagar hokar rahati he
 Apart from this, he also has his own devotion, which incarnates itself on the levels of language and spectacle
 lokanaty kii is vishistataa ko main kyon chhod detaa ? But the creator should not speak much about his creation, the composition speaks for itself and the same is true
 vijay tendulkar In this play, Tendulkar while portraying the struggle of Ghasiram and Nana Fadnavis as the principal, has portrayed the social and political situation of the time in this particular style along with this struggle
 parinamat: sattadhari varg or jansadharan kii sampoorn sthiti par kaal-avasthaapan ke antar se vishesh vaastavik antar nahin padataa
 Ghasiram is in every age and society, and in every era and in that society, there is a chance to make him like that and to kill him as well as Nana Phadnavis - that is what Tendulkar has proposed in his own way
 naanaa ne ghasiram kaa upyog badi dhoortta se kiya he
 But when their 'demon' is created and starts to challenge them, the maternal grandfather also destroys him
 is drushti se yah naatak naanaa fadanvis kaa hi he, isamen shaq nahin
 Ghasiram is, in a way, a mere matter which Tendulkar has made, a means for the expression of his statement
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ naatak main naanaa fadanvis or tatkaaleen patanonmukh samaaj ke chithran dwaara kuch raajnneetik or vishesh saamaajik sthitiyon ke vishay main tendulkar ko kuch satya ujagar karne hai, jo sanathan ho gaye hai
 Nana Fadnavis of history is reputed to be a power tormented by intellectual brilliance
 kintu is naatak main keval ghasiram kotwaal ke prasang kii seemaa main ghire hone ke kaaran unka vyaktitv ikharaa dikhaai padataa he, uske duusare aayam saamne nahin aate
 Indirectly, Tendulkar has used it in the same way as in folk plays where characters are usually of one or two dimensions
 isiilie ek prasiddh marathi sameekshak ne is naatak ko bahut kuch parmparik bhartiya natya-rup uparupak jaisaa bataaya he
 i have considered this same thing in my presentation as the central formula
 naatak dekhte samay darshakon ke man main anjaane hi yah baat utarati jaani chahie ki saare-kaa-sara samaaj hi dhah rahaa he, chuk rahaa he
 This conversation should not be indirect
 is naatak kii rachana marathi rangamanch ke liye ekadam nai hone ke kaaran uske abhipret arth ko manachaahi apratyaksh paddati se vyakt karne main mujhe badi suvidha hui
 No reputed playwright had previously molded a play in the form of folklore, so i was able to use the flexible elastic craft of Loknataka in many ways
 aadamiyon ke jhulate parade kii kalpana rangamanch ke liye adbhut he
 This is also the biggest tip of this drama
 baarah brahman kores ke rup main katha-pravaah sanbhaalate hai
 They also play immediate single roles as required
 yah paradaa do khandon main bantataa he or kshan-bhar main samaaj ke kai-kai ghatakon, icaayiyon ke praturup main dhal jaataa he
 The same curtain, which establishes Ghasiram as Kotwal, is seen in the theater as angry Brahmins during the slaughter of Ghasiram
 shri gajraj nartan karain gaanevaala yahi paradaa ganpati-vandana dwaara lokanaty se apana sambandh jodta he
 a subtle and level relationship between the artist and the role is characteristic of Loknatya

 is samay kii aarti ke thaal ko hi baad main kirthan ke samay kaale tike ke liye upyog kar in vibhinn shaileyon main samya dikhaane kaa maine praytn kiya he
 Brahmin-dressed artists come to the theater through the auditorium
 is prakaar atmiyata utpann hone ke kaaran pradarshan kaa lokanaty-rup darshakon ke maansik str tak adhikadhik sampreshit ho jaataa he
 The pace of the first issue of the play is slower than the second
 lok natya ke bahya swaroop main aitihaasik vyakti ko sthapit hone main samay laganaa swaabhaavik hi he kyonki vah sarvatha nayaa anubhav he
 History-men like Nana Phadnavis coming to the theater dancing-rhythmic was definitely a shocking experience for the Marathi audience
 isliye darshak ko is baat kaa vishwaas dilaanaa tha ki is naatak kaa paatr naanaa fadanvis ek loknatakeey charitra maatr he-aitihaasik naatakon kaa pramanik, sampoorn vyaktitv nahin
 In the view of some reviewers, this was established very slowly
 kintu mujhe laga ki khokhale samaaj ko nirdeshit kar usamen naanaa ke sthaan or kotwali hasil karne ke liye ghasiram dwaara naanaa ke upyog kii prakriya aadi kaa digdarshan vistaarpurn hona hi chahie tha
 The pace of the second digit was fast
 puna ke brahmanon par atyaachaar karanevaala ghasiram, uskaa pratishodh, us pratishodh ke kaaran ghasiram kaa rakshas main roopaantarit hona, aadi agnipariksha ke drishy tak jaakar sthapit hota he
 From Nana's marriage to Gauri's death Ghasiram is very restless but his restlessness is that of Naradham
 vah brahmanon ko kothri main ghont kar maarna nahin chahta tha lekin naradham ghasiram kii hatya uske apratyaksh aparaadh kaa hi fal he-niyati ke is virodhabhas ko tendulkar ne prabhaavshaalee dhang se nirupit kiya he
 Such a vengeance of destiny is found in the context of many historical villains
 ghasiram kii hatya ke baad naanaa kaa chaturaai-bharaa bhaashan dhurttata or kootneeti se purna hone ke kaaran unke prabhutv kaa vilakshan prabhaav utpann karata he or naanaa fadanvis pun: naatak ke kendra main aa jate hai
 The English character of this drama is a mere spectator
 naatak ke ant main vah pichhali chaowkee par bain ore prakashvritt main khadaa he
 The mass celebration is taking place after the murder of Ghasiram below
 yah puna ke bhavi itihaas kaa mahatvapurn purvabhaas he
 The same British, standing at the corner of Ghasiram's Kotwali ceremony, becomes a witness to it
 maine pehali baar jab yah naatak padhaa to laga yah naatak samvaad-pradhan nahin, apekshaakrit drishy-pradhan he
 i was looking for a play that produced visual effects like this
 duusari baat bahut dinon se mere man main yah thi ki filmon main doorvarti madhyavarti or sameepvarti chitron kii teen-chaar duriyon or unke sammishran ke shilp or chaaturya se jo vishesh prabhaav utpann kiya jaataa he, vah rangamanch par bhi kyon na ho ? yah naatak samvaad, nrity, sangeet, gati, paatr, drishy aadi anek khandon ke yoga se agrasar hota he
 The formula that connects them is also tremendous
 in sab tattvon ke saath hi yah naatak ‘purna’ lagata he, atev kaalpanik camera haath main lekar hi maine ise saakaar karne kaa praytn kiya
 Dividing the theater by light-planning produced many desired effects on the theater far and near
 gati or samoohan aadi ko maine kagaji taiyaari main hi nirdhaarit kar liya tha
 In my method, the sketches of the theme are already prepared on every page of the performance copy of the play
 is naatak ke saath-pansth paatro kii gatiyaan swat:sfoort na hon varan niojit rahen, iske liye main puri tarah taiyaar tha
 The pace-style of these characters was expected to be like puppets
 charitra kii drushti se maine jo ghasiram chunaa, vah kad main chota tha
 He must have been a dwarf among the 'ragged' people around
 nrity-gatiyaan saral or sahaj kintu layaaddh thim
 The use of classical dance seemed complex and sophisticated in this folk dance
 nrity-gatiyon main lokanaty kii angadh urja kaa hona aavashyak tha
 The mere death of Ghasiram's dance was presented in a spontaneous manner
 dhol or nagaade kii prabal taal ko chandaavarkarji1 ne aage jaakar vishesh dhang se badhaayaa, jisase drishy kii bheeshanta badi

 is dharti ke patte kii chaudaai uttar se dakshin tak lagbhag 1,600 kimi thi yani iskaa kshetrafal kaafii bada tha
 During the last ice age, the sea level was below today due to the accumulation of a lot of sea water in the form of ice, due to which Berinjia was a land area
 himyug samaapt hone par bahut si yah barf pighali, samudr-tal uthaa or beringia samudr ke neeche dub gaya
 When Berinjia existed, snowfall was less here due to the favorable regional climate and the atmosphere was like the steppes in Central Asia
 itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki us samay kuch maanav samooh asia se aakar yahan bas gaye
 He could not enter North America further than Berinjia because the great glaciers were blocking his path
 iske baad beringia or asia ke bich bhi ek barf kii diwaar khadi hone se beringia par chand hazaar maanav lagbhag 5,000 saalon tak anya maanvon se bina sampark ke himyug ke bhayankar prakope se bache rahe

 isliye kuch hazaar maanav bhi yahan rah paae
 It is believed that it lived in Berinjia for 5–17 thousand years and had no contact with other human societies
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa sochna he ki ek jamaane main beringian maanvon kii pashanyugiya samskruti puure beringia main purv main siberia ke premorye kshetra se lekar pashchim main alaska tak or dakshin main hokkaido tak faili hui thi

 When the weather changed and their terrain sank, the Berinjians were forced to migrate to North America, they would have had to learn to live afresh in America's separate ab-o-hawa
 2005 main hue ek anuvaanshiki anusandhan se sanket miltaa he ki shaayad 80 se bhi kam beringiaayiyon kaa vansh aadhunik kaal tak chal paaya he, yani anya sabhi kisi-na-kisi musiibat main padakar bina aage vansh chalaae hi khatm ho gaye
 Animals such as camel, mammoth, American lion, horse, deer, sheep, wolf and steppe buffalo were inhabited on Berinjia
 uttar america main hathi, baldaar ganda or singh ab vilupt hai lekin ve isi jamini pul ke zariye asia se vahaan pahunche
 It is also known from the study that the camel origin actually started in North America and the camel passed through Berinjia and reached other parts of Asia and the world
 itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki beringia main maimath jaise bhimkaay jaanwaron ke bich rahakar beringian maanav unke shikaar main maahir ho gaye the
 Later, when it spread to Alaska and other parts of North America, there he continued to hunt these large animals on a large scale with his mastery

 Wind energy is less expensive: - chunki vaayu bina mulya uplabdh he, isliye isamen eendhan ke mulyon main vruddhi ke saath mudrasphiti kaa bhi koi jokham nahin he
 In this way, wind energy saves both money and fuel
 atah pawan urja mulyaprabhavi he
 Today, in many areas of the world, where the sources of air are concentrated, wind power is giving a tough challenge to oil-powered and nuclear-powered power, because the cost of developing conventional energy sources is increasing day by day, while The cost of wind energy is dropping rapidly

 Furigana furiganaa ek japani pathan sahaayak he jisamen chote kaana ko kanji ke paas chapa jaataa he, taaki uske uccharan ko darshaya ja sake
 This is a kind of ruby text
 furiganaa ko japani main yomiganaa yaa rubi ルビ) bhi kehete hai
 In modern Japanese it is commonly used to show rare Kanji or rare, non-standard reading or in children's and student books
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke pehle iskaa chalan adhik tha
 Furigana is generally written in hiragana, but in some cases katakana is also used
 khadi likhaai main furiganaa ko aksharon ke baayein ore rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki samastareey likhaai main ise aksharon ke upar rakhaa jaataa he
 Furigana can be written for a letter, with furigana centered on that letter
 jab aisa ek shabd par kiya jaataa he, tab puraa furiganaa shabd un saare kanji aksharon par kendrit hota he, bhale hi har kanji kaa us furiganaa shabd main samaan bhaag na ho
 This happens when that Japanese word has a special pronunciation that has nothing to do with Kanji's reading of that word
 furiganaa font kaa dizine aise hota he ki do kaana akshar ek kanji par baith saken
 If more than that is required, the short font or spacing is changed
 In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading—for example 〜に携わる—the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing
 Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to yōon with a long vowel, such as ryō ; five kana are required for kokorozashi and six for uketamawaru, the longest of any characters in the Joyo kanji
 Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a gairaigo reading; the word "centimeter" is generally written as "cm" and has the seven-kana reading センチメートル; another common example is "%", which has the five kana reading パーセント
 These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units 
 When it is necessary to distinguish between local Japanese kunyomi and Chinese onyomi pronunciations, as in Japanese dictionaries, Japanese pronunciation is written in hiragana and Chinese pronunciation in katakana
 lekin yah antar keval shabdkoshon or sandarbh vishyon main hi aavashyak he
 Hiragana is used in common writing
 iskaa ek apwaad he aadhunik chini sthanon, vyaktiyon or khaanaa ke naam - inhen kanji main likhaa jaataa he or furiganaa main katakana kaa istemaal hota he; or anaupchaarik lekhan main aksar keval katakana main hi likhaa jaataa he
 This is also sometimes done for words in other languages - होगा ニ must have been written above 角 獣, to show the pronunciation of the word unicorn in Japanese
 lekin aam taur par yahan katakana kaa hi upyog kiya jaataa he
 Furigana is commonly used in children's books, which cannot be expected to understand all Kanji, but by showing the pronunciation in Hiragana they will be able to understand the word
 kyonki bacchon ko hiraagaana pehle sikhaaya jaataa he, isliye bahut chote bacchon ke kitabon main katakana par hiraagaana furiganaa hota he
 Also, in these books every Kanji is given a furigana
 ise japani main sorubi kehete hai
 Children's manga and shनेnen manga use furigana
 kai kitabon main uccharan sahaayta hoti he 
 This feature is also available on some websites
 ye un logon main lokapriy hai jo japani sikh rahe hai or japani kahaniyon, upanyaason or lekhon ko padhanaa chaahate hon
 Furigana is used in texts for adult Japanese speakers to show the rare Kanji; In broadcasting services this is done for non-jio Kanji
 furiganaa ko aksar railway steshnon ke kanji or angrezi naamon ke saath dikhaaya jaataa he
 Furigana is also used to show the pronunciation of strange names on maps
 furiganaa ke bina, dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke pehle yuvak lagbhag anpadh hote
 Furigana naam Japanese names are usually written in Kanji
 kyonki ek kanji ke kai pathan ho sakate hai, furiganaa se aksar naam kaa pathan dikhaaya jataahe
 Japanese formal papers have namespaces in Furigana near the place of writing names
 katakana ko apeksha kii jaati he
 Furigana is also used in foreign names written in Kanji
 khaaskar chini or korian naamon main: chini naamon ko japani pathan ke anusaar uccharan kiya jaataa he or pathan hiraagaana main di jaati he, jabaki korian naamon ko korian pathan ke anusaar uccharan kiya jaataa he or uccharan katakana main di jaati he
 The words Kanji and Kanji Yagic are given in Japanese teaching books along with furigana
 vaise hi, videshi bhashaaon ko seekhney kii kitabon main shabdon kaa uccharan furiganaa main di jaati he
 For example, in the Korean language book, the word hangul shows the pronunciation of the word furigana
 japani shiksha mantralay ke dishanirdesh ke anusaar, angrezi shiksha main japani furiganaa kaa upyog nahin karnaa chahie, japani or angrezi uccharan ke antaron ke maddenzar
 For example, "birthdate" would be spelled バ ー ス デ イ ト in Japanese, pronounced "basudeito"
 okuriganaa ve kaana hai jo shabdon main kanji mul ke baad aate hai, visheshan yaa kriya ko puraa karne ke liye or vikaar ko dikhaane ke liye
 In this way they can also show the same pronunciation of the more read Kanji
 udhaaharan: 上がる or 上る 
 It is mandatory to write Okurigana as opposed to Furigana
 kanbun naamak lekhan style main saahitiyik chini aksharon ke japani uccharan kiya jaataa he
 It uses marks called kunten
 furiganaa se alag, kunten japani vyakaran ke angon ko dikhaate hai jinhen kanbun main nahin likhaa jaataa or yah ki shabdon ko japani shabdakram main kaise laayaa jaae
 Furigana is also used to show the meaning of words
 videshi shabdon par kaana yaa kanji us shabd kaa arth japani main dikhaaya ja saktaa he, jo uske anuwaad ke baraabar he
 In the 19th and 20th centuries writers often wrote foreign words in Katakana to show their meanings in Furigana Kanji
 is upyog ko japani main furikanji kehete hai, kyonki furiganaa kaana kaa upyog ko sujhata he

 isamen company kii sampattiyon ko bechakar praapt dhan se rinon kaa bhugtan kiya jaataa he tathaa shesh dhan kaa anshadhariyon ke bich vitaran kar diya jaataa he
 There are three types of company closing: nyaayalay dwaara samaapan ke liye prarthanapatr dene kaa adhikaar swayan company, uske rindaataaon, dhandaataaon tathaa kuch sthitiyon main register athwa kendriya sarkaar dwaara adhikrut vyakti ko hota he
 The main reasons for winding up by the court are: the reduction in the number of members of the company to the lowest number prescribed by the Companies Act and the inability of the company to pay debts
 nyaayalay ko samaapan ke vistrut adhikaar praapt hai or vah jab bhi company kaa samaapan uchit evam nyaaypurna samajhe iske liye aadesh de saktaa he
 The termination of the company is considered to be just and fair in the event of stagnation in the management, ending of the company's base and repression and fraud against minority shareholders of the majority shareholders of the company
 nyaayalay dwaara company kaa parisamapan, samaapan ke liye yachika ke prastut karne ke samay se hi samajha jaataa he
 Whichever petition is given, the winding up order applies to all lenders and money lenders as if it was a joint petition of all of them

 He sells its properties and pays the lenders in the right order and distributes the remainder according to the rights of the shareholders
 company kaa aichhik samaapan nimnlikhit paristhitiyon main ho saktaa he- Voluntary liquidation is of two types - members or lenders
 jab company apane rinon kaa bhugtan karne main samarth ho or uske sadsy samaapan kaa nishchay karen to yah sadasyon kaa aichhik samaapan kehalaata he
 In such a situation the operators of the company have to declare that the company has the ability to pay its debts
 aise samaapan main company kii saadhaaran sabha main ek yaa adhik samapakon kii niyukti kii ja sakati he tathaa unka paarishramik bhi nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Upon the appointment of the terminator, all the rights of the board of directors, managing agent or agent, secretary, treasurer and managers cease to exist, only to inform the registrar of the appointment of the terminator and the vacancy of its place or as authorized by the general assembly or terminator
 Can perform tasks
 kintu jab company apane rinon kaa bhugtan karne main asamarth ho tathaa sanchaalak isaki shodhakshmata kii ghoshnaa na kar saken, aisi paristhiti main kiye janevaale samaapan ko rindaataaon kaa aichhik samaapan kehete hai
 In such a conclusion, it is necessary that on the day the general assembly is convened to pass the resolution on the same or next day, a meeting of the lenders is called
 company ke sadsy evam rindaata apni apni sabhaaon main samaapak kaa manonayan kar sakate hai
 If the persons nominated by members and creditors are different, only the person nominated by the creditors is appointed as the liquidator of the company
 rindaata apni ukt sabha yaa kisi aagaamee sabha main paanch sadasyon tak kii ek nirikshan samiti niyukt kar sakate hai
 The remuneration of the liquidator can be determined by the Inspection Committee, by the creditors in the absence of it and also by the court in the absence of the creditors
 company dwaara aichhik samaapan ke prastaav paas kiye jane ke pashchaat nyaayalay is prakaar ke samaapan kaa aadesh de saktaa he
 The termination of the company by such order is only voluntary but it is done as per the instructions of the court
 iskaa uddeshy company, rindaataaon tathaa anshadhariyon ke hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 Under the direction of the court, the effect of the winding up petition is that the court has jurisdiction over all the promises and valid proceedings in the same way as the petition of winding up by the court
 nirdesan aadesh ke pashchaat nyaayalay ko samaapak ke padchyut karne, uski rikti kii purti karne tathaa atirikt samaapak niyukt karne kaa adhikaar praapt ho jaataa he
