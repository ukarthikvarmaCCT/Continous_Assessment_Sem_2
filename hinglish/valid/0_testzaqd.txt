 yashpal kaa naam aadhunik hindi sahitya ke kathakaron main pramukh he
 They are simultaneously known in both revolutionary and author forms
 premchand ke baad hindi ke suprasiddh pragatisheel kathakaron main inkaa naam liya jaataa he
 Yashpal was associated with the revolutionary movement from his student life, as a result of which he had to spend a long time in jail and jail
 iske baad inhone sahitya ko apana jivan banaaya, jo kaam kabhi inhone bandook ke madhyam se kiya tha, ab vahi kaam inhone bulatin ke madhyam se janajagran kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Yashpal was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1970 by the Government of India in the field of literature and education
 yashpal kaa janm 3 disambar 1903 ko punjab main, firospur chhavnee main ek saadhaaran khatri parivaar main hua tha
 His mother, Mrs
 Premdevi was a teacher in a school in the orphanage there
 yashpal ke pita heeralaal ek saadhaaran kaarobaari vyakti the
 His ancestral village was Rangad, where his ancestors had once settled and settled in Hamirpur
 pita kii ek choti-si dukaan thi or unke vyavsaay ke kaaran hi log unhen ‘lala’ kehete-pukaarte the
 In between, they used to carry goods on horseback and go to the nearby villages for ferrying
 apane vyavsaay se jo thodaa-bahut paisa unhone ikattha kiya tha use ve, bina kisi pukhta likhaa-padhi ke, hath udhaaru taur par sood par uthaaya karte the
 He was uninterested in his family
 isiilie yashpal kii maan apane do beton—yashpal or dharmpal—ko lekar firozpur chhavnee main arya samaaj ke ek skool main padhaate hue apane bacchon kii shiksha-diksha ke bare main kuch adhik hi sajag thim
 His mother and this environment have played a pivotal role in the development of Yashpal's intense hatred towards poverty, the attraction of Arya Samaj and the freedom movement
 yashpal ke rachanaatmak vikaas main unke bachapan main bhogi gai garibi kii ek vishisht bhoomika thi
 In his childhood, Yashpal had heard many stories of terror and strange behavior of the British
 barsaat yaa dhoop se bachane ke liye koi hindustani angrezon ke saamne chaataa lagaae nahin guzar saktaa tha
 The main roads in the big cities and mountains were for them, Hindustani used to walk on the rough roads built under these roads
 yashpal ne apane hosh main in baton ko sirf suna, dekha nahin, kyonki tab tak angrezon kii prabhutaa ko asweekaar karanevaale krantikari andolan kii chingaariyaan jagah-jagah footne lagi thim
 But whatever Yashpal saw in his childhood, it was enough to inflame hatred for the British
 ve likhte hai, ‘‘maine angrezon ko sadak par sarv saadhaaran janata se salaami lete dekha he
 Have seen Hindustani begging in front of him, guessed his disrespect and felt opposition to him
 

’ In the context of his hatred against the British and later British imperialism, Yashpal specifically mentions two incidents of his childhood
 inamen se pehali ghatana unke chaar-paanch varsh kii aayu kii he
 Then one of his relatives was a manager in a cotton ginning factory in Yulekprant
 kaarkaanaa stesan ke paas hi kaam karne vaale angrezon ke do-chaar bangle the
 There was a lot of terror around these people
 inamen se ek bangle main murdiyaan pali thim, jo aas-paas kii sadak par gumti-phirti thim
 One evening Yashpal started teasing those hens
 bangle main rahanevaali mem sahiba ne is harqat par bacchon ke fatkaar diya
 Probably abused someone like 'donkey' or 'owl'
 chaar-paanch varsh ke balak yashpal ne bhi uski gaali kaa pratyuttar gaali se hi diya
 When the woman threatened to kill them, they also responded by threatening her in the same way and then ran away and hid in the factory
 lekin ghatana yun hi taal di janevaali nahin thi
 Complaint was made with his relative
 unhone yashpal kii maan se shikaayat kii or anek ashankaon or aatank ke bich yah bhi bataaya ki isse puure kaarakaane ke logon par kaisaa sankat aa saktaa he
 Then, mentioning its result, Yashpal writes, 'my mother beat me very well with a stick, i went to the ground but was beaten up
 is ghatana ke parinaam se mere man main angrezon ke prati kisi bhaavana utpann hui hogi, yah bhaanp lenaa kathin nahin he
 


 ' duusari ghatana kuch iske baad kii he
 Then Yashpal's mother was headmaster at Arya Kanya Pathshala in Kashipur town of Tirai in Nainital district, in Yuktprant
 shahar se kaafii dur, kaarkaane se hi sambandhi ko bada-sa awaas mila tha or yashpal kii maan bhi vahiin rahati thi
 There was a pond called 'drona Sagar' near the house
 ghar kii striyaan praayah hi vahaan dopaher main ghoomane chali jaati thim
 One day those women were taking a bath there, on the other side of it, two British white soldiers, suddenly appeared
 striyaan unhen dekhakar bhay se chinane lageen or aatmaraksha main ek-duusare se lipatate hue, bhaybheet hokar usee avasthaa main apane kapadeuthakar bhaagane lageen
 Yashpal also eloped with them
 ghatit kuch vishesh nahin hua lekin angrezon se is tarah darkar bhaagane kaa drishy sthaayee rup se unki bal-smriti main tank gaya
 

 'that fear from the British was like seeing a tiger in a flock of goats would be afraid, that is, the English could do anything
 usase darkar rone or chinane ke sivaay doosraa koi upaay nahin tha
 

 ' arya samaaj or congress ve padaav the jinhen paar karke yashpal antat krantikari sanghathan kii ore aae
 His mother wanted to make him a fiery propagator of Swami Dayanand's ideals
 isi uddeshy se unki aarambhik shiksha gurukul kangri main hui
 The seeds of fiery backlash against Arya Samaj oppression fell here on the land of his mind
 yaheen unhen punarutthanavaadee pravritiyon ko bhi nikat se dekhne-samajhane kaa avasar mila
 He also had a painful experience of his poverty here
 apane bachapan main bhi garib hone ke aparaadh ke prati ve apane ko kisi prakaar uttaradaayi nahin samaj pate
 Due to these values, he could never be indifferent to the insult of the poor
 congress yashpal kaa doosraa padaav thi
 Like many others of his era, he too entered politics through Congress
 rajnatik drushti se firozpur chhavnee ek shant jagah thi
 Three miles away from the cantonment there used to be lectures and proms of the city
 khaddar kaa prachaar bhi hota tha
 In 1921, Yashpal was an eighteen-year-old youth at the time of the non-cooperation Movement — full of zeal for patriotism and patriotism, he also participated in the Congress campaign with foreign cloth Holi
 ghar ke hi luggad se bane khaddar ke kurtta-pyjama or gandhi topi pahante the
 He also made a coat of this Khaddar
 baar-baar mailaa ho jane se uubakar unhone use laal rangava liya tha
 In his speeches during this period, as a source of anti-british imperialism statistics, the book he mentions called Desh Darshan is probably Sankharam Ganesh Deuskar's Bengali book Desherkatha published in 1904, whose impression on the Indian public is widespread
 The British government was banned due to the reaction and popularity
 mahatma gandhi or gandhivaad se yashpal ke taatkaalik mohabhang kaa kaaran bhale hi 12 farvari san 22 ko, chaura-chauri kand ke baad mahatma gandhi dwaara andolan ke sthagan kii ghoshnaa rahaa ho, lekin isaki shuruyaat or pehle ho chuki thi
 Gandhi's principle of non-violence went against the agenda of armed revolution of Yashpal and his revolutionary comrades
 mahatma gandhi dwaara dharm or raajnneeti kaa ghaal-mail unhen kahin buniyadi rup se galat lagata tha
 After coming to Lahore after matriculation, Yashpal came into contact with Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Bhagwati Charan Bohra at National College
 noujvaan bharat sabha kii gatividhiyon main unki vyapak or sakriy hissedari vastutah gandhi or gandhivaad se unke mohabhang kii ek anivaary parinaam thi
 The principal sources of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha were Bhagwati Charan and Bhagat Singh
 sake lakshyon par tappanee karte hue yashpal likhte hai, ‘noujvaan bharat sabha kaa kaarykram gandhivaadi congress kii samjhautavaadi niti kii aalochana karke janata ko us rajnatik kaarykram kii prerana dena or janata main krantikariyon or mahatma gandhi tathaa gandhivaadiyon ke bich ek buniyadi antar kii ore sanket karnaa upyogi hoga
 Despite fierce opposition from Lala Lajpat Rai's Hinduist policies due to the lathi charge on him, which ultimately led to his death, Bhagat Singh and his associates killed Sanders
 is ghatana ko unhone ek rashtriya apmaan ke rup main dekha jiske pratirodh ke liye aapasi matbhedon ko bhula dena jaruri tha
 The bombing by Bhagat Singh in the assembly was a logical culmination of this thinking, but Mahatma Gandhi did not issue any formal appeal, despite widespread pressure from the public to protest against the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
 apane krantikari jivan ke jo sansmaran yashpal ne simhavlokan main likhe, unamem apni drushti se unhone us andolan or apane saathiyon kaa moolyankan kiya
 He has always emphasized rationality, reality and reliability
 yah sambhav he ki us moolyankan se bahuton ko asahmati ho yaa yashpal par tathyon ko tod-marodakar prastut karne kaa aarope ho
 Even today there are some people, who do not consider Yashpal very good revolutionary
 unke krantikari jivan ke prasang main unke charitrahanan kii durbhasandhiyon ko hi ve puri tarah sach maanakar chalate hai or shaayad isiilie yashpal kii ore meri nirantar or baar-baar vaapasi ko ve ‘ret kii murti’ gadhane-jaisaa kuch maanate hai
 They also see 'revolution' confined to the politics of bomb-holistic politics
 raajnneetik kranti yashpal ke liye saamaajik vyavastha main krantikari parivartan kaa hi ek hissaa thi
 He saw imperialism as an exploitative system which, in Bhagat Singh's words, 'is the extreme form of exploitation of man in the hands of man and nation in the hands of the nation' 

 Jagmohan and Chamanlal, ed
 19, p
 321)
 The pillar-jagirdari and Zamindari system of this system were likewise under the main agenda of their opposition
 desh main jis rup main swadhinata ai or bahuton kii tarah, ve bhi santusht nahin the
 More than independence, they considered it a transfer of power
 or yah lagbhag vaisaa hi tha jise kabhi premchand ne jon kii jagah govind ko gaddi par baith jane ke rup main apni ashanka vyakt kii thi
 Revolutionary nations were youth driven by spirit of devotion and sacrifice
 avasar aane par unhone hameshaa balidaan se ise pramanit bhi kiya
 But Yashpal insists on seeing his comrades as jealous, hostile, competition-seeking ordinary humans
 apane sansmaranon main aaj rajendra yadav jise adarsh ghoshit karte hai—‘ve devtaa nahin hai’—uski shuruyaat hindi main vastutah yashpal ke inhen sansmaranon se hoti he
 These revolutionaries were not isolated from ordinary human beings, despite being somewhat different, typical and devoted exclusively to their goals
 ho bhi sakate the
 Sharat Chandra presented the ideal of revolutionaries in Pathredawi, Yashpal considered it to be real, which inspires patriotism, cannot be considered a representative and authentic picture of the revolutionary movement and that life
 subodhachandra sen gupt patheradavi main bijli panivali jhanjhawati raat main savyasachi ke nishakraman ko bhavi mahanayake subhaashachandr bose ke palaayan ke ek roopak ke taur par dekhte hai, jabaki yashpal savyasachi ke atimanviya se lagane vaale kaary-kalapon or khoh-khandhiron main bitaye janevaale jivan ko vaastavik or pramanik nahin maanate
 He uses his long experiences of revolutionary life as the mainstay of his criticism
 2, march san 38 ko jail se rihaai ke baad, jab usee varsh november main yashpal ne viplav kaa prakaashan-sampadan shuru kiya to apane is kaam ko unhone ‘bullate bulatin’ ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 He made writing his base to carry forward the unfinished work of the non-violent and egalitarian society he wanted to build through political revolutionaries
 apane samay kii saamaajik-raajnneetik samasyaon ke kendra main rakhkar likhe gaye sahitya ko praayah hameshaa hi vichaarvaadi kahkar laanchit kiya jaataa he
 This was Nand Dulare Vajpayee's big charge against Premchand
 apane upar lagaae gaye prachaar ke aarope kaa yashpal ne uttar bhi lagbhag premchand kii hi tarah diya
 In the role of his first novel, Dada Comrade, he wrote, 'I have a complaint to the lovers of art that i give priority to art and to the promotion of art
 mere prati die gaye is faisale ke viruddh mujhe apil nahin kerani
 Santosh is able to make his intent clear 


 Later commenting on his literary concerns in more detail, he later wrote, 'the struggle for the complete development and liberation of man is the meaning of the author
 jab lekhak apni kala ke madhyam se manushya kii mukti ke liye puraani vyavastha or vichaaron main antarvirodh dikhaata he or nae adarsh saamne rakhata he to us par adarshaheen or bhautikwaadi hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya jaataa he
 Today's writer has his roots in reality, so he is not only materialistic but he is also not ideal
 uske adarsh adhik yatharth hai
 When the writer of today supports new ideals through his art, he is accused of being a preacher
 lekhak sadaa hi apni kala se kisi vichaar yaa adarsh ke prati sahanubhuti yaa virodh paidaa karata he
 a meaningful literature will be there
 yashpal ke lekhan kii pramukh vidha upanyaas he, lekin apane lekhan kii shuruuaat unhone kahaniyon se hi kii
 His stories are not beset by the politics of his time, such as his novels
 nai kahani ke daur main stri ke deh or man ke kritrim vibhaajan ke viruddh ek sampurna stri kii jis chhavi par jor diya gaya, uski vaastavik shuruuaat yashpal se hi hoti he
 How many stories of Yashpal have been used as fertilizer in the direction of thinking of today's story
 vartmaan or aagat katha-paridrishy kii sambhaavnaaon kii drushti se unki sarthakata asandigdh he
 His story-collections include cage flight, enlightenment, ashes of chinagari, flower kurta, crusade, why did you say i am beautiful and Uttami's mother is the chief
 jo or jaisi duniya banane ke liye yashpal sakriy raajnneeti se sahitya kii ore aae the, uskaa nakshaa unke aage shuru se bahut kuch spasht tha
 He made the basis of the actual achievements of the system in place of a utopia
 yashpal kii vaicharik yatra main yah sutara shuru se ant tak sakriy dikhaai detaa he ki janata kaa vyapak sahyog or sakriy bhagidaari hi kisi raashtra ke nirmaan or vikaas ke mukhya kaarak hai
 Yashpal is an advocate and patron of the broad interests of the public everywhere
 apni patrakarita or lekhan-karm ko jab yashpal ‘bullate kii jagah bulatin’ ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai to ek tarah se ve apane rachanaatmak sarokaaron par hi tippanee kar rahe hote hai
 This accumulation of representative work of such a bad writer will inspire him to know and understand in its entirety, we believe so

 According to Encyclopedia of Hinduism, the Kali Yuga started from 3102 BCE immediately after Lord Krishna's departure from this earth
 dharmraj yudhisthir, bhimsen, arjuna, nakul or sahadev paanchon pandav mahaparakramee parakshit ko rajya dekar mahaprayan hetu uttarakhand kii ore chale gayi or vahaan jaakar punyalok ko praapt huye
 The king began to rule according to Parikshit Dharma and according to the Brahmins
 uttar naresh kii putree iravati ke saath unhone apana vivaah kiya or us uttam patni se unke chaar putr utpann huye
 By making Acharya Krupa a Guru, he performed three Ashwamedha Yagyas on the banks of Jahnavi
 un yagyon main anant dhan raashi brahmanon ko daan main di or digvijay hetu nikal gayi
 At the same time, Dharma made the form of a bull and met Gaurupini Earth on the Saraswati coast
 gaurupini prithvi kii netron se ashru bah rahe the or vah shrihin si prathit ho rahi thi
 Religion asked the Earth - "oh God! Why are you being mistaken? What are you worried about? Are you worrying about me, now that i am left with only one foot or you are talking about this?" Worried that now the Shudra will rule over you? " prithvi boli - "he dharm! tum sarvajna hokar bhi mujh se mere dukh kaa kaaran poochhate ho! satya, pavitrataa, kshamaa, dayaa, santosh, tyaag, sham, dam, tap, saralata, kshamta, shaastra vichaar, uparati, titiksha, gyaan, vairaygy, shaury, tej, aishwarya, bal, smriti, kaanti, kaushal, swatantrata, nirbhikta, komalta, dhairya, saahas, sheel, vinay, saubhaahgya, utsaah, gambheertha, kirti, aastikta, sthirataa, gaurav, ahankaarhinta aadi gunon se yukt bhagwaan shrikrishna ke swadham gaman ke kaaran ghor kaliyug mere upar aa gaya he
 i have great grief for all of you as well as Dev, Pitrugan, Rishi, Sadhu, Sannyasi etc
 bhagwaan shrikrishna ke jin charnon kii seva lakshmi ji karti hai unamem camel, vajra, ankush, dhwaja aadi ke chihn virajman hai or ve hi charan mujh par padate the jisase main saubhagyawati thi
 Now my good luck has ended
 " While Dharma and Prithvi were talking about this, Kali Yuga came there as a crowned Shudra and started killing them both
 raja parakshit digvijay karte huye vahiin par se guzar rahe the
 They saw the crowned Shudra with a stick in his hand, beating a cow and a bull badly
 vah bail atyant sundar tha, uskaa shwet rang tha or keval ek pair tha
 The cow was also beautiful like Kamadhenu
 donon hi bhaybheet ho kar kaanp rahe the
 Maharaj Parikshit offered his bow and bowed in a solemn voice like a cloud - "O wicked! Sinner! Naradham! Who are you? Why are you torturing these innocent cows and bulls? You are a great criminal
" tere aparaadh kaa uchit dand tera vadh hi he
 "on hearing these words, Kali Yuga shivered with fear
 maharaj ne bail se poocha ki he bail tumhaare teen pair cas toote gayi hai
 You are a bull or a god
 he dhenuputr! tum nirbhiktapurvak apana apana vrutant mujhe bataao
 Hey Gaumata! Now you are free from fear
 main dushton ko dand detaa hoon
 Which evil has committed this stigma in the holy fame of the Pandavas by committing gross sins in my kingdom? Even if he is a sinful true God, i will cut off his hands too
 tab dharm bolaa - "he maharaj! aapane bhagwaan shrikrishna ke parambhakt pandavon ke kul main janm liya he atah ye vachan aap hi ke yogya hai
 Hey Rajan! We do not know who afflicts the creatures of the world
 shastron main bhi iskaa nirupan anek prakaar se kiya gaya he
 He who does not believe in duality accepts the cause of sorrow for himself
 koi praarabdh ko hi dukh kaa kaaran maanata he or koi karm ko hi dukh kaa nimitt samajhataa he
 Certain scholars consider nature and certain Gods to be the cause of sorrow
 atah he rajan! ab aap hi nishchit kijiye ki dukh kaa kaaran koun he
 " samraat parakshit us bail ke vachanon ko sun kar bole - "he vrishabh! aap avashya hi bail ke rup main dharm hai or yah gaurupini prithvi mata he
 You know the heart of religion very well
 aap kisi kii chugali nahin kar sakate isiliye aap dukh dene vaale kaa naam nahin bataa rahe hai
 o religion! Your tenacity, purity, mercy and truth were the four stages in the Satyuga
 treta main teen charan rah gayi, dwapar main do hi rah gayi or ab is dusht kaliyug ke kaaran aapkaa ek hi charan rah gaya he
 This unrighteous Kali Yuga is trying to destroy even that phase by its untruth
 bhagwaan shrikrishnachandra ke swadham gaman se dusht paapi shudra raja log is gaurupini prithvi ko bhogenge isi kaaran se yah mata bhi duhkhi hai
 " itnaa kah kar raja parikshith ne us paapi shudra rajveshadhari kaliyug ko maarane ke liye apni tikshn dhar vaali talwaar nikaali
 Kaliyug, fearful, took off his majestic dress and fell at the feet of King Parikshit and started saying tari-tahi
 raja parakshit bade sharnaagat vatsal the, unhone sharan main aaye huye kaliyug ko maarna uchit na samajha or kaliyug se kaha - "he kaliyug! tu mere sharan main aa gaya he isaliye maine tuje pranadan diya
 But only you are the root cause of wrongdoing, sin, lies, theft, fraud, impoverishment etc
 atah tu mere rajya se turant nikal ja or laut kar phir kabhi mat aana
 " raja parakshit ke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug ne kaatar vaani main kaha - "he rajan! aapkaa rajya to sampoorn prithvi par he, aapke rajya se baahar aisa koi bhi sthaan nahin he jahaan par ki main nivas kar sakun
 Hey Bhupathi! You are very kind, you have given me shelter
 ab dayaa karke mere nivas kaa bhi kuch na kuch prabandh aapako karnaa hi hoga
 " kaliyug is tarah kehane par raja parakshit soch main pad gayi
 After considering it, he said - "O Kali Yuga! Gaming, drinking, adultery and violence are inhabited by untruth, item, work and anger in these four places
 in chaar sthanon main nivas karne kii main tuje chhot detaa hoon
 "kali Yuga said this -" o Uttaranandan! These four places are insufficient for my residence
 dayaa karke koi or bhi sthaan mujhe dijiye
 "on asking for this kind of Kali Yuga, King Parikshit gave him the fifth place 'swarna'
 kaliyug in sthanon ke mil jane se pratyakshtah to vahaan se chalaa gaya kintu kuch dur jane ke baad adrushya rup main waapas aakar raja parakshit ke swarna mukut main nivas karne laga
 After this, he wandered a lot for the hunted prey and had a bad condition due to hunger and thirst
 shaam ke samay thake haare vah shamik rishi ke ashram pahunche rishi us samay brahamalin samaaghi main leen the 
 
 parikshit ne kaha ki hamen pyaas lagi he hamen pani chahie yahaan or koi bhi nahi he kya aap sun rahe he ham raja parikshit bol rahe he hamen pyaas lagi he hamen pani chahie aapako sunai nahi detaa kya rishi us samay samaaghi main brahamalin the raja ne do-teen baar pani maanga parantu rishi kii samaaghi nahi tuuti 
 
 rajmukut main baithe kalyug kii prarena se unki satvik buddhi bhrasht ho gai or unhone rishi ko dand dene kaa faisla kiya 
 But due to the good cremations of the king, he restrained himself from that sin
 krodh vash unhone mara hua saanp rishi ke gale main daal diya 
 The son of that Shamik Rishi, Shringiu was very strong and was bathing in the river at that time
 duusare rishi kumaro ne jaakar sara vritakan sunaaya 
 Hearing how a king has disowned his father, he became mad with anger and by filling the same river of river Shran with an anjuni, he cursed the king, the arrogant and foolish king who insulted my great father the same

 Template: Copied to Wikibooks kute kaa prashikshan ek kute ko prashikshit karne kii aisi prakriya he jisamen unhen kuch nishchit adeshon par pratikriya dete hue kuch karrwai karnaa sikhaaya jaataa he, jise samajhane ke liye kute ko prashikshit kiya jaataa he
 It is a general term that does not in itself describe what and how a dog is taught
 kute kaa prashikshan ke kai tareeke or kai uddeshy hote hai, buniyadi aagyaakaarita prashikshan se lekar vishishtikrut kshetron main kanoon pravartan, sena, khoj or bachaav, shikaar, pashudhan ke saath kaam karnaa, viklang logon kii sahaayta, manoranjan, kutton ke khel or logon or sampatti kii suraksha shaamil hai
 As a flock animal, wild dogs have natural instincts that help their companion dogs to cooperate
 kai gharelu kute vritti yaa prajnan ke madhyam se itane prashikshit hote hai ki ve maanav niyantrak ke dwaara die jane vaale sanketon ko thik prakaar se samaj kar unke liye pratikriya karte hai
 Most dogs, regardless of their ultimate advanced training or desired purpose, live with people who want them to behave in a way that makes them feel good to be around, keep them safe, and protect them from other people and pets
 provide protection
 Dogs cannot understand basic obedience on their own; They should be trained for this
 prashikshan kaa sabase mushkil hissaa he ek maanviya tareeke main kute ke saath baatcheet karnaa jise kutta samaj sake
 haalanki, is prakaar ke sanchaar main nihit siddhant bahut saadhaaran he: vaanchit vyavhaar ke liye puraskrit karke or avaanchit vyavhaar kii andekhi karke yaa isamen sanshodhan karte hue ise aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 Basic pet obedience training typically involves six behaviors: "sudhaar" main kabhi bhi hanikaarak shaareerik bal yaa hinsa ko shaamil nahin kiya janaa chahie
 prashikshan ke dauraan bal kaa prayog vivaadaaspad he or ise halke dhang se nahin liya janaa chahie, kyonki chaahe yah ant main vyavhaar main hi khatm ho, jab ise kuch kutton ke saath galat tareeke se lagu kiya jaataa he, yah drive kii kshati, tanaav or yahaan tak kii kuch maamalon main ugrata kaa kaaran bhi ban saktaa he
 a controller may decide to use force, although the standard used by most trainers is the minimum required amount that is used to prevent unwanted behavior
 janm ke purv kii avadhi ko haal hi main pillon kii vikaas avadhi ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya he
 It is thought that "in some mammals long-term effects on behavioral development can be produced by events in the womb"
 The existence of this period has been ignored in previous studies, since puppy behavior cannot be observed
 Was
 ultrasound mashin ke vikaas ke saath, ab maa ke bheetar rahete hue bhi ek pille kaa prekshan kiya ja saktaa he, jab garbhadhaaran kaa chauthaa saptaah shuru ho jaye
 It was found that the fetus responds to touch and / or to pressure exerted from outside the mother's abdomen
 iske alaava, yah siddhant diya gaya he ki chunki pillon main janm ke samay acchhee tarah se viksit sparsh samvednaa hoti he, to zarur janm se pehle bhi sparsh kii samvednaa acchhee tarah se viksit hi hoti hogi
 adhyayanon main paaya gaya ki "jab ek garbhvatee jaanavar ko pyaar se dulaara jaataa he uskaa baccha aisa hota he ki use pyaar se aasaani se niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he", fox ke anusaar, isse unamem aaraam, bhaavnaatmak lagaav or samajikaran kii bhaavana kaa vikaas hota he
 Other studies have shown that puppies that receive external cues during pregnancy have a greater tolerance for touch than puppies who did not receive such cues
 ise siddhant rup main is tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki maa ke pet ko pyaar se dulaara janaa pille main sakaaratmak, logon ke saath laabhakaari samajikaran ko badhaava detaa he
 During the first two weeks of a puppy's life, also known as the neonatal period, puppies can learn simple group activities
 haalanki, praarambhik anubhav kii ghatnaon ke baad kii avadhi main jane kii sambhaavna nahin hoti he
 Studies indicate that nothing is learned by experience in the neonatal period
 yah siddhant diya gaya he ki aisa is tathy ke kaaran he ki abhi tak pille ke mastishk, samvednaa or prerak angon kaa vikaas nahin hua hota he
 Depending on its sensitivity and limited ability to learn, it will be difficult to influence the psychology of a puppy in a positive or negative sense
 vikaas kii agali avadhi ko samajikaran avadhi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This period starts around 3 weeks of age and ends around 12 weeks of age
 is avadhi kaa mukhya pahalu saamaajik khel he
 Social exploration, playful fighting and playful sexual behavior are very important for the development of social relationships during its life
 pille kii apane maa ke saath or anya pillon ke saath baatcheet kaa prabhaav vyavhaar ke nae pratirupon par pratyaksh rup se padataa he
 Puppies during this period develop social relationships with and with other puppies
 haalanki, ek aisa bindu he jis par pillon main ajanabiyon ke liye dar viksit ho saktaa he
 Puppies at 3 to 5 weeks of age actively attract strangers
 iske kuch hi samay baad ve ajanabiyon se bachane lagate hai or dhire dhire yah algaav bad jaataa he, jab ve 12 se 14 saptaah kii umr tak pahunch jate hai
 While this natural fear for strangers always keeps curious puppies away from predators, on the other hand it can become a hindrance to normal relationships with people
 is avadhi ke dauraan, achaanak hone vaali aawaaj yaa gatiyon ke liye usamen daraane vaali pratikriya kaa vikaas hota he
 This helps puppies understand the difference between dangerous and safe or trivial events
 samajikaran kii avadhi ke dauraan, usamen kuch vishisht sthanon ke prati lagaav viksit ho jaataa he
 This is seen when the puppy is replaced by a lot of disturbance or panic
 ise sthaniyakaran ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Localization often occurs at the climax in puppies between the ages of 6–7 weeks and then decreases until a change in location disturbs a puppy
 jin kutton par jivan ke pehle aath saptahon ke dauraan maanav kaa niyantran rahata he or unhen pyaar se dulaara jaataa he, ve aamtaur par aasaani se prashikshit kiye ja sakate hai or maanav awaas main rahane ke liye jaldi taiyaar ho jate hai
 Ideally, puppies should be kept in their permanent homes between 8 and 10 weeks of age
 In some places it is against the law to take puppies away from their mother before the age of 8 weeks
 shuruyaat main 10 se 12 saptaah kii avadhi ke dauraan pille nayi chizon se zyada darate hai, isliye unhen kisi nae ghar main anukulit karnaa zyada mushkil hota he
 Puppies can start learning orders and activities from the age of 8 weeks; Capacity, concentration and physical coordination are some of its limitations
 teen se chah saptaah kii aayu ke bich, ek pilla apane vyask daant nikaalnaa shuru karata he
 This period is very painful and many owners do not know the natural need to chew
 daant nikaalane main hone vaale dard ko kam karne ke liye banaaye gaye vishesh chabane vaale khilone dekar, kisi duusare furniture ityadi kii ore dhyaan banta kar dard ko kam karne main madad kii ja sakati he
 Many people spray a bad smell or bad taste on their favorite things, such as shoes, furniture, or even wallpaper, to stop this chewing process
 bitor appal saamanyatya kaam main liya jane vaala spray he, lekin kai vanijyik spray uplabdh hai
 Different sprays work better for different applications, owners, or puppies
 peshewar "kute ke prashikshak " kute ko prashikshit karne ke liye uske abhibhavak ko prashikshit karte hai
 To be most effective, the guardian should use the techniques taught to the dog and emphasize them
 Those parents and dogs who join such classes together learn more about each other, they get a chance to learn how to work together under the guidance of a trainer
 Training is more effective when people train a dog during training, it ensures command, methods and enforcement
 ye kakshaen anya kutton or logon ke liye kutton ke samajikaran main bhi madad karti hai
 Training classes are provided by many canals, pet stores and independent instructors
 samuhik kakshaen tab tak uplabdh nahin hoti jab tak 3 – 4 maah kii aayu main pille kaa tikaakaran puraa na ho jaye; haalanki, kuch prashikshak pilla samajikaran kakshaen uplabdh karaate hai jinamein pillon ko unke sthaayee ghar main rakhe jane ke turant baad panjikrut kiya ja saktaa he, jab rogon ke jokhim kii sambhaavna nunatam ho or pillon ko praarambhik tikaakaran diya ja chukaa ho
 adhikansh maamalon main, mul prashikshan kakshaen keval un pillon ko sweekaar karti hai jo kam se kam 3 se 6 maah kii aayu ke hon, haalanki aapako salaah di jaati he jaise hi pilaa aapke ghar aaye, turant prashikshan shuru karnaa chahie
 pillon ko vyaktigat rup se bhi prashikshakon ke dwaara prashikshit kiya ja saktaa he, isamen 8 saptaah kii umr shuru hone ke baad prashikshak khud kute ke ghar aakar use prashikshit karata he
 a puppy requires discipline, consistency and patience of its owner
 pilla prashikshan pravastha ek kute ko swasth or khush banane ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he or saath hi yah ghar ke maahaul ko bhi surakshit or khushnuma banaati he
 Dogs are expressive; they can bite, growl and bacchanalize their needs
 apana aacharan badalanaa ek pille ke vyavhaar ko badalane main mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 Home training is an important issue for puppies
 ghar prashikshan ke vibhinn tareeke kargar hote hai, yadhyapi kunjee sthir honi chahie
 niyamit rup se lagu kiye jane vaale niyamon ke saath, chota baksaa, cret, yaa kaagaj prashikshan safal ho saktaa he
 Relaxation performed with the help of posture) can be an effective technique for establishing a relationship between a controller and a puppy
 niyantrak 4–6 maah ke baad kii aayu ke pille ko nichali sthiti main nahin rakhata or kute ko aise sthiti main pakadta he jisase isaki sthiti ko banaaye rakhane ke liye nunatam paryaapt bal hi lagaaya jaye
 ek baar jab pilla sangharsh karnaa band kar detaa he or relex ho jaataa he, niyantrak pille kii gardan or peeth ko masalane lagata he
 Basically, dog training is related to communication
 maanviya drushtikon se, niyantrak kute se baat karata he or use bataata he kii koun se vyavhaar sahi or vaanchhneeya hai, yaa koun se paristhitiyon main unhen praathamikta di jaani chahie or koun se vyavhaar vaanchhneeya nahin hai
 a controller must understand the dog's point
 The dog may indicate that he is uncertain, confused, happy, excited or feeling something similar
 kute ke prashikshan main uski bhaavnaatmak sthiti par dhyaan diya janaa chahie, kyonki ek kutta jo tanaav main he yaa vichlit he, vah prabhavi rup se sikh nahin paayegaa
 According to learning theory there are four important messages that a controller can give to a dog
 in sandeshon ke liye shabdon yaa sanketon kaa nirantar upyog karne se kutta jaldi hi unhen samajhane lagata he
 It is important to note that dog rewards and prize markers are not the same
 puraskaar marker ek sanket he jo kute ko bataata he ki use puraskaar mila he
 Appreciating it, playing with it, or anything that rewards a dog are just the same type of maltose and latcose sugars, so they are also pure carbohydrates
 glicogen tahsoos ho
 puraskaar marker ke baad puraskaar naa dena puraskaar marker ke mulya ko khatm kar detaa he or isse prashikshan adhik mushkil ho jaataa he
 The meaning of these four signs is taught to the dog through repetition, allowing it to form an association with classical conditioning and to connect the punishment marker with the sentence
 in sandeshon ko maukhik rup se yaa ankahe sanketon ke rup main bataaya ja saktaa he
 Mechanical clickers are often used as a prize marker, with the words "yes!" Or "good!"
 The word "no" is a common sentencing marker
 "oh!" ek aam en aar em he
 a k GS is a commonly repeated syllable haathon ke sanket or sharir kii bhashaa bhi kutton ko sikhaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Some sources argue that human voice is the most effective marker
 kute commands ko aasaani se samaj nahin sakate hai
 a command that can operate indoors may be confusing for the same command outside the home or in a different situation
 In every new situation the command needs to be re-taught
 ise kabhi kabhi "cross-sandarbhikaran" kaha jaataa he, arthath kute ko yah samajhnaa hota he ki bhinn sandarbhon ke liye use kya siikhnaa he
 Most training revolves around setting results for the behavior of dogs
 oprent condishning parinaamon ke nimna chaar prakaaron ko paribhaashit karti he
 Most instructors claim that they use "positive training methods"
 saamanyatya, iskaa arth he achche vyavhaar ko badhaane ke liye puraskaar aadhaarit prashikshan kaa upyog karnaa naaki bure vyavhaar ko kam karne ke liye shaareerik dand kaa upyog karnaa
 Positive reinforcement can be anything that makes the dog feel rewarded - special food, the opportunity to play with a tug toy, social contact with other dogs, or the attention of its owner
 The more rewarded the dog, the stronger it will become, the more prepared it will be to get more reinforcement, or the better it will work
 The only reward is for them to be happy about the dog's achievement
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch kute ke prashikshak aise vyavhaar kaa suzav dete hai, jiskaa aap vishesh rup se paksh len
 ho saktaa he ki aapke kute yaa pille ko puraskaar ke rup main jigar kaa paneer khaanaa pasand ho
 However, always keep in mind that what you are feeding him as a positive reinforcement is healthy and does not harm the overall health of your dog or puppy
 kuch prashikshak pille ke prashikshan ke liye uski kisi khaas khilone kii ichha ko puraa karte hai, taaki khilonaa achche vyavhaar ke liye adhik shashakt sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran kaa kaarak ban jaye
 is prakriya ko kaha jaataa he "shikaar ko paane kii ichha paidaa karnaa " or iskaa upyog samaanyata narkotics kii pahchaan or police seva main kaam karne vaale kutton main kiya jaataa he
 Its goal is to create a dog that will work independently for a long time, in the hope of getting the prize for its special toy
 The use sajaa ke paramparaagat roopon kaa upyog aadhunik kute ke prashikshak ke dwaara nunatam kar diya gaya he
 This type of punishment is usually given to a dog only if the dog is not obeying the owner at all and the owner needs to protect the dog in a critical situation
 sajaa ko prabhavi dhang se kute ko vaanchit vyavhaar sikhaane ke saath joda jaataa he, lekin yah ekmaatr samaadhaan nahin he, kyonki isse kute main dar kii bhaavana paidaa ho jaayegi or agar use vaanchit vyavhaar nahin sikhaaya jaataa he to vah sahyog karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hoga
 Punishment should only be used when it is appropriate to the dog's personality, age experience and physical and emotional state
 When talking with some dogs in a harsh voice, they get scared or worried
 kuch anya kute is tarah kii maukhik fatkaar par dhyaan nahin dete hai
 Some dogs become afraid of water when water is sprayed on them to improve them
 kai kutton ke maalik apane kutton ko gur sikhaate hai
 Neck tie chain: a chain tied in the neck is made of metal rings with a large round ring at one end
 is zanjeer ko inamen se ek challe main se nikaala jaataa he or kute ke sir se pahana diya jaataa he
 This chain is tightened when the dog behaves undesirable
 parmparik kute kaa prashikshan main iskaa upyog praathmik rup se kiya jaataa he
 Prong Chain Collar): Prong chains are made of metal rings that are fitted together through long, usually bushy, teeth, with the tip of the teeth facing the inside towards the dog's neck
 is zanjeer kaa ek hissaa chaiyn kii kadiyon ke ek loop se bana hota he jo khinche jane par zanjeer ko kas detaa he or kute ko gardan par chubh jaataa he
 The use of these chains is controversial and has been opposed by animal rights groups such as PETA
 is zanjeer kaa upyog mukhyatya parmparik kute kaa prashikshan main kiya jaataa he
 Radio Controlled Chains: These consist of a radio receiver connected to the chain and a transmitter that the instructor holds
 trigar karne par, zanjeer se kuch sanket utpann hote hai
 Signs emanating from different chains are special
 kuch se dhwani nikalati he, kuch compit hone lagate hai, kuch se citronela yaa anya arosol spray nikalate hai, kuch vidyutiya aaveg paidaa karte hai
 Some chains contain many of these

 Martingale chain: Martingale chain is a chain that has only one section that tightens when pulled

 Head collar: The head collar is very similar to the rein of a horse, the principle is that if you control the head then you will be able to control the body as well
 The head collar usually has two loops
 ek loop kaan ke peeche chalaa jaataa he or doosraa dutte ke naak ke upar jaataa he or ye donon kute ke jabade ke neeche milte hai
 Due to this tool, the dog is not able to pull itself
 is upkaran kaa upyog aamtaur par sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran prashikshan ke dauraan kiya jaataa he
 No Pull Harness: No Pull Harness is worn on the body of the animal
 no pul harnes maanak harnes se kaaphi alag hoti he chunki isse kutta aasaani se khinch nahin paata, kyonki yah urja ko kute kii peeth or kandhe par vitarit karata he
 This no-pull harness obstructs the movements of the dog's body when the dog pulls

 However guard dogs and police dogs are not companion animals
 sarankshak kutton ko kenayan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo prashikshan ke dwaara sampatti, vyakti yaa vastuon kii suraksha karte hai
 a well-trained guardian dog protects a person, property, or object on command and also "stops" its work on command
 sangrakshak jaanwaron ko prashikshit karne kii kai vidhiyon main pashchimi or purvi vidhiyaan shaamil hai
 The Schutzhund game also involves a safety phase in which the dog cuts off the padded sleeve worn by a "person", this person plays the role of the "bad guy" and the dog scares the controller; The dog also has to work on the command or protection of the person
 kuch paristhitiyon main, jab kutton ko sampatti kii raksha karne ke liye akele choda jaataa he, to unhen is baat ke liye prashikshit karnaa bhi jaruri hota he ve agyaat vyakti ke dwaara di gayi khaadya saamagree ko naa khaaen
 Supporting dogs, such as guides and hearing dogs, are carefully trained to use their sensory skills and instill a sense of attachment with the disabled person they need to help

 In it, he wrote about Iran before Arabic Fatah on Persia in the seventh century

 He was 85 at this time
 usne yah kavy sultan mahmud gazanvi ko samarpit kiya jisane 999 i
 main khurasaan vijay kar liya tha
 He was given only 20 thousand dirhams
 firdausi ke tan badan main aag lag gai
 He ran away from his country towards Hirat, but before fleeing, he added a poem to the Shahnama, which strongly condemns Sultan Mahmud
 shahname main firdausi ne iran ke puranic baadshahon kii, jinke karnaamon se vah atyadhik prabhavit tha, badi kii prashansa kii he
 His poetry reveals his love for ancient Iran and hatred for the Arabs
 sabhavat: kattar musalamaanon ko santusht karne ke liye usne baad main yusuf julykha naamak masanvi likhi jise bavahid shaasha bahauddaula tathaa uske putr sultanuddaula ko samarpit kiya
 He then returned to his homeland Tus and died there

 It is said that as his janaza was leaving the gate of a nearby village, a caravan arrived with 60,000 dinars sent by Sultan Mahmud, whose poet had hoped
 firdausi kii putree ne samast dhan, daan punya main laga diya
 Very beautiful illustrated manuscripts of the Shahnama are preserved in large museums of the world

 Subsequently several editions were published from India and Iran
 sansar kii anek bhashaaon main iske anuwaad chap chuke hai
 Mahmud Ghaznavi is said to have pledged to Firdausi that he would give a dinar for every word of 'shahnama'
 varshon kii mehnat ke baad jab 'shahnamaa' taiyaar ho gaya or firdausi use lekar mahmud gazanabi ke darbar main gaya to samraat ne use prayek shabd ke liye ek dinar nahin balki ek dirham kaa bhugtan kara diya
 It is said that angry at this, Firdausi returned and did not even take a dirham
 yah vaayada kilaafi kuch aisi thi jaise kisi kavi ke prati shabd ek rupee dene kaa vachan dekar prati shabd ek paisa diya jaye
 Firdausi angrily wrote a few lines against Mahmud Ghaznabi
 ve panktiyaan itani prabhaavshaalee thi ki puure samrajya main fail gayin
 a few years later, his trusted ministers requested Mahmud Ghaznavi that Firdausi be paid at the same rate that was fixed
 samraat ke kaaran poochne par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ham log samrajya ke jis kone main jate hai hamen ve panktiyaan sunne ko milti hai jo firdausi ne aapke viruddh likhi hai or hamaara sirf shame se jhuk jaataa he
 If he is given money at the prescribed rate, then we will get a lot of moral strength
 ' samraat ne aadesh de diya
 When a car full of dinars reached Firdausi's house, Firdausi's funeral was coming out from inside the house
 puri umr garibi, tangi or mufalisi main kaatane ke baad firdausi mar chukaa tha
 It is said that his girl, the only child of Firdausi, refused to take this paddy
 is tarah samraat kavi kaa karjadaar rahaa or aaj bhi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Firdausi's Shahnama is as famous today or more famous as the lines that Firdausi wrote while criticizing Mahmud Ghaznabi
 firdausi kaa 'shahnamaa' darasal iran kaa itihaas hi nahin irani asmita kii pahchaan he
 It describes the achievements of ancient Iran
 samraaton kaa itihaas he
 The ancient Persian texts have been incorporated and given a new look
 myth or itihaas ke sammishran se ek adbhut prabhaav utpann hua he
 There are excellent examples of love, rebellion, valor, wickedness, humanism, war, courage that have made the 'shahnama' the immortal masterpiece of Iranian literature
 irani sahitya main 'shahnamaa' jitani tarah se jitani baar chapa he utana or koi pustak nahin chhapi he
 Firdausi has created characters like Rustom and Sohrab which have become part of human memory
 jaisaa ki iraniyon ne apane bade kaviyon ke saath kiya he, firdausi ke madhbare ke chaaron ore sundar baag he
 There are statues here and there

 bahut pehle, ringamaster ek jinn tha, lekin usne apni shaktiyon kaa prayog keval apane hit ke liye karata tha, na ki insaanon kii bhalaai ke liye, isliye anya jinno ne uski shaktiyon ko chhinane kaa faisla kiya
 But he was still immortal, and still very powerful and knowledgeable
 usne ek din apni shaktiyon ko waapas paane or badla lene kii kasam khai
 Aladdin's parents Arun and Riya believed that Aladdin's story was based on the 'aladdin and His Lamp' reality by the Arabian Nights
 to unhone apane bete kaa naam alladin rakh diya is ummid main ki vah unke liye asli jaadooi lamp khojane ke liye unki khoj main bhagya laaegaa
 After many years of searching, he found the lamp
 kuch samaay baad ringamaster or uske saathiyo ne un par hamalaa kiya
 Riya secretly rubbed the lamp and summoned Genius, and he sought genius to save Aladdin from the ringmaster, who was then a very young child
 jeniyas mushkil se alladin ko ringamaster se bachaane main sakasham hua, lekin jab usne alladin ko bachaa liya, to ringamaster ke giroh ne arun or riya ko maar daalaa
 The ringmaster found only one piece of the lamp, the rest of the piece was lost

 Aladdin's grandfather taught him a magic trick: He would put a small object in his hand, close his hand, say the magic word "tak dheena dhin", and when he opened his hand a different little object would appear from him
 
 yah asli jaadu nahin tha; vah gupt rup se vastu ko apane duusare haath main sthanantarit kar dete the
 It was entertaining, and sometimes useful
 jiniyon ke paas kuch niyam the jinka paalan unako karnaa padhata tha
 At first, there were three well-known wishes: Whoever lit the genie's lamp and called Jean, had three wishes
 iske alaava, ek jinn kisi ko bhi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa sakati he, jiske bhi paas yaa to unke lamp ho yaa uskaa koi hisse ho --- yah ringamaster kii raksha karata tha, kyonki uske paas abhi bhi vah tukdaa tha jo jeniyas ke lamp kaa tha
 If a genie refused to grant a wish, he could lose his powers and become mortal
 naitikta ke kuch prakaar bhi hai jinako jinnhon ko paalan karnaa padhata tha, yah bataate hue ki jiniyon ko manushyon ko unki man chaahi ichha dene ke liye apni shaktiyon kaa upyog karnaa padataa tha naaki unhen swaarthee rup se upyog karnaa tha- yah dusron kii tarah jaadui niyam nahin tha, lekin ise jini samaaj dwaara lagu kiya gaya tha
 If a person does not follow these rules, then the society could ban him and the misbehavior would remove the power of the genie
 yah jaankaree main nahin he ki astitv main kitne jinn hai or unamem se kitne swatantra hai, yaa kitne lamp tak simit hai yaa nahin
 There is a magic mirror that the genie can use to get information and answer questions from them
 yah tut saktaa he, lekin agar iske tukade phir se ikatthe hote hai, to yah apane mul doshapurn aakaar main aata he
 Then a human just found the mirror and collected the pieces again when the ringmaster and his gang killed him and stole the mirror

 Mind maps are considered a type of spider diagram
 1970 ke dashak main isi tarah kii avadharana "vichaar suraj phod " tha
 The term "mind map" was first popularized by the use of illustrations that visually "map" the trail back centuries by using British popular psychology writer and television personality Tony Buzan, branching and radial maps

 Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular beliefs about the functions of the brain hemispheres in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note-making
 Buzan man ke nakshe banane ke liye nimnlikhit nirdeshon ko detaa he: As with other drawing tools, mind maps can be used to generate ideas, generate, structure, visualize, and classify and solve problems, and make decisions by studying information about organizing, and for writing As an aid

 Nothing is known about the origin and early history of Yashodharman

 The people of this dynasty were ruling Malwa in the middle of the fifth century as feudatories of the Gupta Empire
 kintu uske baad lagbhag sau varsho ke liye is vansh kii koi soochna nahin milti

 yadi isse mandsor abhilekh main mihirkul ke varnan kii samanta dekhi jaay to kaha ja saktaa he ki mihikul kii dwitiya paraajay yashodharman ke hi haathon hui thi
 Defeating the powerful Huns and Guptas were the major achievements of Yashodharman
