 Guru ji was equally blessed with Baba Budaji
 chathe guru ne sikh dharm, samskruti evam isaki aachaar-samhita main anek aise parivartanon ko apni ankhon se dekha jinke kaaran sikhi kaa mahaan bootaa apni jade majboot kar rahaa tha
 Guru Hargobind Sahib gave protection to this great plant of heritage with his divine vision and gave it an opportunity to flourish

 mata kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue guru sahib ne ye chola unase lekar pahan liya
 When Guru Sahib was freed from the fort of Gwalior, he wore this same chola, whose 52 kings, holding 52 buds, came out one by one in the prison of the fort, since then Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji called "donor Bandi Chod"

 muhaavara mulat: arabi bhashaa kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he baatcheet karnaa yaa uttar dena
 Some people call the idiom 'everyday', 'colloquial', 'tarzeclam', or 'istalah', but neither of these words could become a complete synonym of 'idiom'
 sanskrit vaanmay main muhaavara kaa samanarthak koi shabd nahin paaya jaataa
 Some people use 'utility', 'vagriti', 'vagdhara' or 'bhasha-sampradaya' for this
 ve0es0 apte ne apane ‘inglish-sanskrit kosh’ main muhaavarey ke paryaayavachi shabdon main ‘vaak-paddati', ‘vaak reeti’, ‘vaak-vyavhaar’ or ‘vishisht swaroop' ko likhaa he
 Paradkar has considered 'speech-community' as a synonym for idioms
 kaaka kalelkar ne ‘vaak-prachaar’ ko ‘muhaavarey’ ke liye ‘roodhi’ shabd kaa suzav diya he
 In Greek, the idiom is called 'idioma', 'indiatisme' in French and 'idiam' in English
 mote taur par jis sugathit shabd-samooh se lakshanajanya or kabhi-kabhi vyanjanajanya kuch vishisht arth nikalataa he use muhaavara kehete hai
 Sometimes it is sarcastic too
 muhaavarey bhashaa ko sudrudh, gatisheel or ruchikar banaate hai
 The use of idioms brings wonderful pictoriality to the language
 muhaavaron ke bina bhashaa nistej, neeras or nishpraan ho jaati he
 In Hindi language, very popular and people's sentences are known as proverbs
 in vaakyon main janata ke anubhav kaa nichod yaa saar hota he
 Different scholars have defined 'idioms' in different ways, some of which are given here: dow udai narayan tiwari ne likhaa he- In 'advanced Learners Dictionary', AS Hornby wrote that 'chambers tuventith centuri dictionari' ke anusaar, According to the Oxford Concise Dictionary, ‘muhaavara’ kii sabase adhik vyapak tathaa santoshajanak paribhaasha dow omprakash gupt ne nimna shabdon main di he : The idioms are the foundation stones of the language on which his grand building has remained till date, and the idioms have been protecting him from the ravages of heat, winter and rain, while correcting his wear and tear
 muhaavarey bhashaa ko sudrudh, gatisheel or ruchikar banaate hai
 Use of them brings pictoriality in the language, such as hitting an ax on their feet, pressing a finger under the teeth, having a wolf, etc
 shabdon kii teen shaktiyaan hoti hai : When a word or group of words is used in a general sense, then there is its design power
 abhidha dwaara abhivyakti arth ko abhidheyarth yaa mukhyarth kehete hai; jaise ‘sir par chadhana’ kaa arth kisi cheez ko kisi sthaan se uthaa kar sir par rakhana hoga
 But when there is no realization of the main purpose and because of the stereotype or the famous or any other meaning related to the main cause, to inform a particular purpose, then the power through which it happens is called the symptom
 yah shakti ‘arpit’ arthath kalpit hoti he
 That is why Vishwanath wrote in 'sahityadarpan': lakshana se ‘sir par chadhane’ kaa arth aadar dena hoga
 Mammatt has also supported his opinion in more poetic terms in 'poetic light'
 udaahranarth, ‘‘angaaron par lotna’, ‘aankh maarna’, ‘aankhon main raat kaatna’, ‘aag se khelnaa’, ‘aasmaan par diya jalaana’, ‘doodh-ghi kii nadiyaan bahaanaa’, ‘khun chusna’, ‘chaiyn kii banshi bajaanaa’, ‘tahaakaa lagaana’, ‘lambi baanh hona’, ‘vijay kaa danka bajaanaa’ or sher bananaa’ aadi main lakshana shakti kaa prayog hua he
 So, they are idioms
 parantu is sandarbh se yah drashtavy he ki lakshana ke samast udhaaharan muhaavarey ke antargat nahin aa sakate
 Only those examples of symptoms can come under idioms which have become stereotyped or famous due to chronic practice
 jab abhidha or lakshana apana kaam karke virat ho jaati hai tab jis shakti se shabd-samoohon yaa vaakyon ke kisi arth kii soochna milti he use ‘vyanjana’ kehete hai
 The sarcasm that occurs in idioms is not due to the meaning of one word but to the chained meanings of all the words, or to say that it lives in the meaning of the whole idiom
 is prakaar ‘sir par chadhana’ muhaavarey kaa vyangyarth na to ‘sir’ par nirbhar karata he na ‘chadhaane’ par varan puure muhaavarey kaa arth hota he ‘uchhrunkhal, anushaasanheen athwa dheeth bananaa
 'it is different from satirical meaning and expression expression meaning
 anek muhaavarey main alankaaron kaa prayog hua rahata he
 But this does not mean that every idiom is a rhetorical, or every rhetorical phrase is an idiom
 neeche kuch muhaavarey die jate hai jinamein alankaaron kaa prayog hua he : Being red ember, money is manhood and masculinity is money, embers rain, gold is gold, etc
 idhar-udhar karnaa, oonch-neech dekhnaa, daaen-baayen na dekhnaa, pani se pyaas na bujhna
 Breaking the bangle, wearing the bangle, having a lamp, increasing the shop, being full of demand and womb, etc
 shabdalankarmulak muhaavarey anjar-panjar deele hona, aany-vaayam-shany bakna, kaccha-pakkaa, der-saver, boria-bistar baandhna, aadi
 Some idioms are based on practices; To take the lead
 madhya yug main raaj-darbaron main yah pratha thi ki jab koi dushkar kaary karnaa hota tha tab samanton or veeron aadi ko bulaakar unhen uske sambandh main sab baaten bataa di jaati thim or thali main paan rakh diya jaataa tha

 kuch muhaavarey kahaniyon par aadhaarit hote the, jaise tedi kheer hona, dhaporshankh hona, sone kaa mrug hona, aadi
 Sometimes proper nouns are used like caste nouns to create idioms; Like - sleep of Kumbhakaran, Draupadi rip, Jaichand, becoming Yudhishthira, Vibhishana, becoming Harishchandra, etc
 jab manushya prabal bhavavesh main hote hai tab unke munh se kuch aspasht dhvaniyaan nikal jaati hai jo baad main kisi ek arth main rudh ho jaati hai or muhaavarey kahalaane lagati hai

 Kaw-kaw kan, kukdu-kun speak, bhinna go, etc
 phus-phus karnaa, phus-phus hona, aadi
 To-morrow sar-saraahat hona, sany-sany karnaa, aadi

 Many idioms are based on someone's experience
 atev yadi unamem kisi prakaar kaa parivartan yaa ulatpher kiya jaataa he to unka anubhav-tatv nasht ho jaataa he
