 At the apparent magnitude of the Andromeda galaxy at 3
4, it is one of the brightest messier planets that can be seen easily with the naked eye, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution
 However when its image is taken by a large telescope, it is visible six times as compared to the full moon, then only its bright part can be seen with naked eyes or small telescope

 Andromeda Tarapunja The earliest recorded observations were made in 964 BCE by the Persian astronomer, Abad al-rahman al-sufi, who interpreted it as a "small cloud" in his epistemological book
 us samay ke anya tara chitron main ise little cloud ke rup main ankit kiya gaya tha
 The first description of the planet was made in 1612 by German astronomer Simone Marius, based on observations made by binoculars
 charles mesir ne ise 1764 main M31 grah ke rup main soochibaddh kiya or iskaa khojakarta ke rup main shrey galati se marius ko diya gaya, jo sufi al ke pehle kaary se anbhigya the
 In 1785, astronomer William Herschel noted the blurred red color in the core area of M31
 unka maananaa tha ki yah "mahaan nebula" main sabase nikatatam he or nebula ke rang or aakaar ke aadhaar par unhone galat anumaan lagaaya ki yah sirius kii duuri kii tulana main 2000 guna se adhik bada nahin he
 In 1864, William Huggins observed the spectrum of M31 and found it to be different from the gaseous nebula
 M31 ke spectra aavritiyon kii nirantarata ke liye pradarshit gahari avasorana rekhaon kaa nirmaan parat ke rup main karti he jo kisi padaarth ke rasinic mishran kii pahchaan karne main madad karte hai
 The Andromeda Nebula was very similar to the spectra of different stars that originated in which the M31 had a stellar nature
 1885 main, supernova ko pehali baar M31 main dekha gaya, jise is tarapunj main keval ek hi baar dekha gaya
 M31 was thought to be the closest planet at the time, so the object was close to an idea, so this fantasy could not gain much popularity, and this unrelated event was called Nova and named it "nova 1885"
 Gone

 jiske parinamswaroop us samay surya kii disha 300 kilometres per second main iskaa veg bahut adhik tej record kiya gaya
 In 1917, the American astronomer Heber Curtis saw the Nova in M31
 Searching for photo records, he discovered 11 more novels
 curtis ne dekha he ki un novon kaa ausatan aakaar tarapunj main sthit novon ke aakaar se 10 guna dhundhala tha
 As a result, he could be seen from an estimated 500,000 light years away
 isliye vah tathakthith "dweepiya brahmad" pariklpana prastaavak ban gaya, jo is sarpilaakaar nebula tha vastav main vah swatantra tarapunj tha
 In 1920, a great debate began between Harley Sharpley and Curtis concerning the galaxy, the spiral nebula, and the dimensions of the universe

 In 1922, Ernest Opik presented a very beautiful and simple astronomical method of estimating the distance of M31
 usne hamaare tarapunj ko andromeda se lagbhag 450 kepisi rakhaa, jo lagbhag 1500 keelvai he
 Edwin Hubel began this debate in 1925 when he first identified various cepheid stars beyond the Akash Ganga for an astrophysical image of M31

6×1010 l ☉ hamaari akashganga kii chamak kii tulana main 25% adhik he
 However, the rate of star formation in the galaxy is much higher than that of M31 with only one solar body generated per year as compared to 3–5 solar bodies in the Milky Way
 akashganga main supernove kii dar M31 kii lagbhag doguni he
 It is revealed that M31 may have had a great composition phase in the past but it is quieter than before but the star formation seems to be more active than it is in the galaxy
 kya yah chalata rahegaa, to akashganga kii chamak bhavishya main M31 kii tulana main adhik tej ho sakati he
 Based on its design in visible light, the Andromeda galaxy is classified as sab and the spiral galaxies system as de vécoleurs-sandéz
 However, data from Survey 2MASS showed that the structure of M31 emerged from a box
 Which means that the galaxy is actually seen to be linearly reflected almost as its vertical axis
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne kek telescope kaa upyog yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ki taron kaa timatimaana akashganga ke baahar kii ore badhata jaataa he jo vastav main mukhya discs kaa hi ek hissaa he
 This means that the spiral disk of stars in Andromeda is three times larger than the previous estimate
 nirantar saakshyon se pataa chalata he usamen ek vishaal taarakeey discs he jo akashganga ke vyas ko 220,000 prakaash varsh se adhik badhaati he
 Previously, the size of Andromeda was estimated to be around 70,000 to 120,000 light years
 akashganga prithvi kii tulana main ek taraf lagbhag 77 ° jhuki hui he 
 akashganga kii tiryak kaat ke aakaar kaa vishleshan use samtal discs kii tulana main ek ati spasht, S-aakaar jhukaav ko darshata he
 Possible reasons for such an inclination may be satellite galaxy gravity near M31
 akashganga M33 main M31 ke kaaran kuch jhukaav sambhav he, haalanki yah uski yathavat duuri or trigyakaar vegon par nirbhar karata he
 In the section of the spectroscopy study, different rotational velocity measurements of M31 are explained
 uske antarvaaag ke nazadik, vibhinn 1,300 prakaash varsh prakaash varsh kii trigya par 225 kilometres per second kii ucchata vaale ghurnankaree veg main dekhe gaye hai or tab usamen 7,000 prakaash varsh kii nunatam giravat dekhi gai he jiskaa ghurnankaree veg 50 kilometres per second tak ho saktaa he
 Thereafter, its velocity steadily increases to a radius of 33,000 light years, reaching a peak of 250 kilometres per second
 duuri badhane ke saath-saath iske veg main giravat aati chali jaati he, jisamen 200 kilometres per second se 80,000 prakaash varsh kii giravat sambhav he
 These velocities measure the concentric mass in the navel to be approximately 6 × 109 M☉

 Andromeda's spiral arm extends to the h II region, which Bade has interpreted as "scattered beads of beads"
 ve aapas main bahut adhik sate hue dikhaai padate hai, haalanki ve hamaari akashganga main dur-duure tak faile hue hai
 Refined images of the Milky Way clearly depict a two-arm galaxy rotating clockwise

 It can be seen migrating from the neutral hydrogen clouds of stars
 1998 main, european antariksh vedhashala chhaviyon europea antariksh agency infrared spes oborbetary chhaviyon kaa pradarshan valyakaar akashganga main pargaman kar sakati he
 In Andromeda, gas and dust form many annular forms, which form a ring especially with a radius 32,000 light years from its core
 yah valay akashganga ke drishyman prakaash chhaviyon se chipa hua he kyonki yah mukhya rup se thandi dhul se bana dhul se bana he
 On examining the inner region of Andromeda, small particles have been detected in its ring and it is thought that this may have occurred as a result of exposure to M32 200 million years ago
 iskaa anukaran karne par pataa lagata he ki choti akashganga uttararddh ke dhruviya dhuree ke saath andromeda kii discs guzari
 isaki takkar ke kaaran chote M32 ke aadhe se adhik pindon ko alag kar diya or andromeda main valyakaar sancharana kii rachana hui
 Studies of the enhanced halo of M31 showed that it is not possible to compare it to the Milky Way because the aura of stars usually contains "insufficient metals" that increase as the distance increases
 in saakshyon se pataa chalata he ki donon akashganga samaan vikasvaadi path kaa anusaran karti hai
 They have assimilated or incorporated 1-200 low-mass galaxies during the last 12 billion years
 M31 ke vistaarit prabhamandal main taron or akashganga main do akashgangaon ko alag karne vaali lagbhag ek tihaai duuri main vruddhi sambhav he
 M31 is known as a dense and small star cluster at its center
 ek badi doorabeen main adhik vistaarit vruddhi main sannhit taare ke drishyman prabhaav ko banaata he
 The brightness of the nucleus is more of a brightly spherical swarm
 1991 main, tod aar lair ne WFPC kaa upyog kiya he or use baad main hoobal antariksh telescope ko andromenda ke bhitari cendrak kii chhaviyaan lene ke liye sthapit kiya gaya
 The nucleus has two valencies separated by 1

 The misty valency of P2 is located in the center of the galaxy and a 3–5x107m☉ black hole
 scot tramene ne suzav diya ki dekhe gaye dabl cendrak kii vyakhya sambhav he ki yadi P1 kendriya blike hole main taron ke aas-paas utkendrak kaksh main taron ke bimb kaa prakshepan hota he
 Its eccentricity is such that the stars are attached to the orbital aposcenter, which increases the orientation of the stars
 P2 main garm varnakrameey varg a taron kii saghan chakrika he
 a star redness filter is unclear but in blue and ultraviolet light they affect the nucleus due to which P2 appears to be more effective than P1
 jabaki, isaki aarambhik khoj ke samay, yah pariklpana kii gai thi ki dabl cendrak kaa chamkila bhaag andromenda ke paas choti akashganga "kenibeliced" kaa shesh bhaag tha, jiske baad uski koi spasht vyakhya nahin kii gai
 The basic reason for this is that this type of nucleus has a very short lifetime due to the fluctuating disruption of the central black hole
 jabaki iskaa aanshik rup se samdhaan sambhav he yadi P1 ke paas uskaa apana sthir karne vaala blike hole ho P1 main uthal-puthal kaa matlab yah nahin he ki uske centre main blike hole he
 In particular, no X-rays of the galaxy were taken until the end of 1968

 Among these masses, Mayol II was identified as the largest giant, nicknamed the globular one, with a more massive cluster than any other common cluster of galaxies
 isamen kai million taare hai or isaki chamak omega senturi ke tulana main doguni he jo akashganga main sabase chamkile golakaar punj ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Globular 1 has many stellar numbers and is too dense for the normal spheroid
 jiske parinamswaroop, kuch log G1 ko choti akashganga kaa chota bhaag maanate hai jise kuch samay pehle M31 mana gaya tha
 The most pronounced glare of the globular is similar to that of the G76, which is located in the southeastern part of its eastern part
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne M31 main tara punj ke ek puri tarah se bhinn prakaar kii khoj kii
 The discovered New Star Punja consisted of millions of stars and in these same circular stars a similar number of other stars can be discovered

 yadhyapi ise sahitya kii sabase anupam kritiyon main se ek mana jaataa he, kintu aaj bhi yah granth prayek bhartiya ke liye ek anukaraniya strot he
 This work is a saga of the history of ancient India
 isi main hindu dharm kaa pavithratam granth bhagavadgita sannihit he
 There are approximately 1,10,000 verses in the entire Mahabharata, ten times more in magnitude than the Greek poems Iliad and Odyssey
 hindu manyataon, puranic sandarbho evam swayan mahabharat ke anusaar is kavy kaa rachanaakaar vedavyas ji ko mana jaataa he
 The author of this poem, Ved Vyas ji, in his unique poetry has depicted the greatest mysteries of the Vedas, Vedangas and Upanishads
 iske atirikt is kavy main nyaay, shiksha, chikitsa, jyotish, yudhniti, yogashastra, arthshaastra, vaastushastra, shilpashaastra, kaamshaastra, khagolavidya tathaa dharamshastra kaa bhi vistaar se varnan kiya gaya hai
 It took 3 years for Ved Vyas ji to complete the Mahabharata, it may be because writing script art had not developed so much at that time, it was safe to remember the traditional Vedic texts by the sages in that period from generation to generation
 Used to be kept
 us samay sanskrit rishiyon kii bhashaa thi or brahmi aam bolchaal kii bhashaa hua karti thi
 In this way the entire Vedic literature was memorized orally by the sages for generations and generations
 phir dhire dhire jab samay ke prabhaav se vaidic yug ke patan ke saath hi rishiyon kii vaidic saahitiyon ko yaad rakhane kii style lupt ho gayi tab se vaidic sahitya ko pandulipiyon par likhakar surakshit rakhane kaa prachlan ho gaya
 It is well accepted that the modern form of Mahabharata is made through many stages
 vidwaanon dwaara isaki rachana kii chaar praarambhik avasthaaen pahachaani gayi hai
 These stages are as follows in the possible composition time order: saraswati nadi Dwarka devin saraswatin chaiv tato jayamudirayet
 
 mahabharat chandravanshiyon ke do pariwaron kaurav or pandav ke bich hue yuddh kaa vrittant he
 The struggle for land between 100 Kaurava brothers and five Pandava brothers eventually led to the Mahabharata War
 is yuddh kii bhartiya or pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kai bhinn bhinn nirdhaarit kii gayi tithiyaan nimnlikhit hai- Main mention: Detailed story of Mahabharata puraanon ke anusaar brahma ji se atri, atri se chandramaa, chandramaa se budh or budh se ila-nandan pururava kaa janm hua
 From him, Yayati was born to King Nahusha and Nahusha to Age
 yayati se puru hue
 The dynasty of Puru included Bharata and King Kuru in the clan of Bharata
 kuru ke vansh main shantanu hue
 Ganganandan Bhishma was born from Shantanu
 shantanu se satyavati ke garbh se chitrangad or vichitraveery utpann hue the
 Killed by Gandharva named Chitrangad and King Vichitravirya, who was suffering from Rajyakshama, died
 tab satyavati kii ajna se vyasaji ne niyog ke dwaara ambika ke garbh se dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu ko utpann kiya
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons by Gandhari, of which Duryodhana was the eldest and Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthra, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the, atah unki jagah par pandu ko raja banaaya gaya
 Once, while playing the game in the forest, a moth-headed mrigarupadhari sage died from the arrow of Pandu
 us rishi se shaapit ho ki "ab jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga to teri mrityu ho jaayegi", pandu atyant duhkhi hokar apni raniyon sahit samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag karke tathaa hastinapur main dhritarashtra ko apana kaa pratinidhi banaakar van main rahane lagen
 At the behest of King Pandu, Kunti invited religion from the mantra given by the sage Durvasa to Yudhishthira and later to Bhima from Vayudev and Arjuna from Indra
 kunti se hi us mantra kii diksha le maadri ne ashwanikumaron se nakul tathaa sahadev ko janm diya
 One day, while traveling on the banks of Sarita in the forest with Raja Pandu Madri, Pandu became agitated due to his fickleness which led to his death
 maadri unke saath sati ho gai kintu putron ke paalan-poshan ke liye kunti hastinapur laut ai
 Before marriage, Kunti gave birth to Karna from the Sun's share and in the fear of localism, Karna was drowned in the Ganges river
 dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath ne use bachaakar uskaa paalan kiya
 Karna was interested in warfare, so after Dronacharya's refusal, he got education from Parashurama
 shakuni ke chhalkapat se duryodhana ne pandavon ko bachapan main kai baar maarane kaa praytn kiya tathaa yuvavastha main bhi jab yudhisthir ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to laksh ke bane hue ghar laakshagrah main pandavon ko bhejkar unhen aag se jalaane kaa praytn kiya, kintu vidura kii sahaayta ke kaaran se ve us jalte hue grih se baahar nikal gayi
 The Pandavas went from there to the city of Ekchakra and after making a costume of the Muni, resided in the house of a Brahmin
 phir vyas ji ke kehane par ve paanchal rajya main gayi jahaan draupadi kaa swayamvar honevaala tha
 There, one after the other, all the kings and princes tried to target the fish, but success was not lost
 tatpashchaat arjuna ne tailpaatr main pratibimb ko dekhte huye ek hi baan se matsay ko bhed daalaa or draupadi ne aage bad kar arjuna ke gale main varmala daal deen
 According to the promise of Mother Kunti, the five Pandavas received Draupadi as a wife
 draupadi ke swayamvar ke samay duryodhana ke saath hi saath drupad,dhridhyumna evam anek anya logon ko andeh ho gaya tha ki ve paanch brahman pandav hi hai
 Hence, Drupada invited him to his kingdom to test him
 rajaprasaad main drupad evam dhridhyumna ne pehle rajkosh ko dikhaaya kintu pandavon ne vahaan rakhe ratnabhushanon tathaa ratna-maaniky aadi main kisi prakaar kii ruchi nahin dikhaai
 But when they went to the armory, they all showed great interest in the weapons kept there and kept the weapons of their choice
 unke kriya-kalap se drupad ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ye brahmanon ke rup main pandav hi hai
 Before Draupadi Swayamvar, all the Pandavas except Vidur were considered dead and due to this Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince
 grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke liye yudhisthir ne dhritarashtra dwaara die khandahar swarup khandav van ko aadhe rajya ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 There, Arjuna, along with Shri Krishna, defeated all the gods in battle and burnt Khandavavan and satisfied the fire made by Indra by ridding himself of his arrows
 iske falswarup arjuna ne agnidev se divya gandiv dhanush or uttam rath tathaa shrikrishna ne sudarshan chakra praapt kiya
 Indra was shocked to see the valor of his son Arjuna
 unhone khandavaprastha ke wanon ko hataa diya
 After that the Pandavas beautified the city with the help of Maya demon along with Shri Krishna
 vah shahar ek dwitiya swarg ke samaan ho gaya
 At the behest of Indra, Dev Shilpi Vishwakarma and Maya Demon together built the Khandava forest into a grand city as Indrapuri, which was named Indraprastha
 pandavon ne sampoorn dishaao par vijay pate hue prachur suvarnrashi se paripurna rajasuya yajna kaa anushthan kiya
 His splendor became unbearable for Duryodhana, so Shakuni, Karna and Duryodhana etc
 instigated the yoke with Yudhishthira and won his brothers, Draupadi and his kingdom by treacherous gaming and laughing and expelling Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha
 Tried
 parantu gandhari ne aakar aisa hone se roak diya
 Dhritarashtra once again ordered Duryodhana to gamble with him
 yah tay hua ki ek hi daanv main jo bhi paksh haar jayega, ve mrigcharm dhaaran kar baarah varsh vanvaas karenge or ek varsh agyatavaas main rahenge
 If they are recognized even in that one year, then they will have to suffer twelve years of exile again
 is prakaar pun jue main parrast hokar yudhisthir apane bhaaiyon sahit van main chale gayi
 After the twelfth year there, he went to Virat Nagar for one year of exile
 jab kaurav viraat kii gauon ko harkar le jane lage, tab unhen arjuna ne parrast kiya
 At that time, the Kauravas had recognized the Pandavas, but their unknown residence was completed by then
 parantu 12 varsho ke gyaat or ek varsh ke agyatavaas puraa karne ke baad bhi kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya
 Bhishma fought for ten days and killed most of the Pandava army with his arrows
 bhishma kii mrityu unki ichha ke adheen thi
 On the suggestion of Shri Krishna, the Pandavas asked Bhishma the remedy for his death
 bhishma ne kaha ki pandav shikhandi ko saamne karke yuddh lade
 Bhishma considered her to be a girl and after getting him in front, he was not going to wield weapons
 or shikhandi ko apane purv janm ke apmaan kaa badla bhi lenaa tha uske liye shivaji se vardaan bhi liya ki bhishma ki mrityu kaa kaaran banegi
 10 In the battle of the day, Arjuna placed Shikhandi on his chariot, and seeing Shikhandi in front, Bhishma gave up his bow and Arjuna with his sack put him to sleep on the bed of arrows
 tab acharya dron ne senapatitv kaa bhaar grahan kiya
 Again there was a fierce war on both sides
 viraat or drupad aadi raja dronrupi samudr main dub gayi the
 But when Pandavo convinces Drona that Ashwatthama was killed
 to acharya dron ne niraash hon astr shastr tyagkar uske baad yoga samadhi le kar apana sharir tyaag diya
 At such a time, Dhrishtadyumna cut the forehead of Drona with a sword for yoga samadhi and dropped it on the ground
 dron vadh ke pashchaat karn kaurav sena kaa karnadhaar hua
 Karna and Arjuna had a great war-like battle involving weapons and weapons, which was also going to defeat the devasur-sangram
 karn or arjuna ke sangram main karn ne apane baanon se shatru-paksh ke bahut-se veeron kaa sanhaar kar daalaa
 Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 guru parashuram ke shaap ke kaaran vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paakar rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he
 Then Krishna asks Arjuna to kill him by reminding him of the Abhimanyu slaughter, the prostitute and his vow to slay Karna at the Kuru Sabha, then Arjuna beheads Karna with a divine weapon
 tadnantar raja shalya kaurav-sena ke senapati hue, kintu ve yuddh main aadhe din tak hi tik sake
 King Yudhishthira killed him by noon
 duryodhana kii sari sena ke maare jane par ant main uskaa bhimsen ke saath gada yuddh hua
 Bhima slapped him on the thigh and killed him
 iskaa pratishodh lene ke liye ashwatthama ne raatri main pandavon kii ek akshuhinee sena, draupadi ke paanchon putron, uske paanchaladeshiy bandhuon tathaa dhridhyumna ko sadaa ke liye sula diya
 Then Arjuna defeated Ashwatthama and took out the gem of his head
 phir ashwatthama ne uttara ke garbh par brahmastra kaa prayog kiya
 His womb was often burnt by his weapon, but Lord Krishna gave him life again
 uttara kaa vahi garbhasth shishu aage chalakar raja parakshit ke naam se vikhyath hua
 At the end of this war, Kritavarma, Kripacharya and Ashwatthama, three Kauravapaksiyas and five Pandavas, Satyaki and Sri Krishna, these seven Pandavapakshiya heroes survived
 tatpashchaat yudhisthir rajsinghaasana par asin hue
 Yadavakul was killed due to the curse of Brahmins and Gandhari
 balbhadraji yoga se apana sharir tyaag kar sheshnag swarup hokar samudr main chale gayi
 One day, all the great-grandchildren of Lord Krishna, to see the power of the great men, made one a woman and went to the sages and asked, o Munishreshtha! This woman is from the womb, tell us who will be born from her womb? The sages came to know that this child had brought a man to them, making them a woman
 muniyon ne krishna ke prapautron ko shrapa ki is maanav ke garbh se ek moosal likalegaa jisase tumhaare vansh kaa ant hoga
 Krishna's great-grandchildren rubbed that pestle on a stone and threw it into the river and threw its tip
 us churna se utpann vriksh kii pattiyon se sabhi krishna ke praputra mrityu ko praapt kiye
 Seeing this, Shri Krishna also sat meditating under a tree
 'zaraa' naam ke ek vyaadh ne apane baan kii nok par moosal kaa nok laga diya tathaa bhagwaan krishna ke charankmal ko mrug samajhakar us baan se prahaar kiya
 The kiss of Krishna's feet by that arrow caused his paramdham to go
 prabhu apane sampurna sharir ke saath golok prasthaan kiye
 The sea then submerged Dwarkapuri in its waters
 tadnantar dwarka se laute hue arjuna ke mukh se yadavon ke sanhaar kaa samachar sunakar yudhisthir ne sansar kii anityata kaa vichaar karke parakshit ko rajasan par bithaaya or draupadi tathaa bhaaiyon ko saath le himalay kii taraf mahaprasthaan ke path par agrasar hue
 Except Yudhishthira in that Mahapath, all fell one by one
 ant main yudhisthir indra ke rath par arudh ho bhaaiyon sahit swarg ko chale gayi
 More here ga: vichitraveery ke nidhan ke baad vyas se dhritarashtra or pandu kaa janm hua
 Ch: Karna was born before her marriage to Kunti

 But these sons were born to Kunti and Madri due to the influence of the gods
 yama dharmraj se yudhisthir,vaayu se bhim,indra se arjuna,maadri ko aswani devataaon se judawaan bachche nakul, sahadev hue
 Duryodhana and his hundred brothers were born once

 He was called Uppandava

 vital sign mukhya ullekh :mahabharat ke paatr There are many parts of Mahabharata which are generally considered as separate and complete books in themselves
 mukhya rup se in bhaagon ko alag se mahatv diya jaataa he:- There are many variations of Mahabharata in South Asia, different versions of Mahabharata are found in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Java Island, Jakarta, Thailand, Tibet, Burma

 In addition to India, Mahabharata also makes reference to many other geographical locations of the world such as China's Gobi Desert, Egypt's Nile River, Red Sea, and in addition, the map of the entire earth is also mentioned in the Jambukhand-manufacturing festival of Bhishma festival of Mahabharata

 The district is named Gorakhpur after Gorakhnath
 guru gorakhnath ji ke naam se hi nepal ke gorkhaon ne naam paaya
 There is a district of Gorkha in Nepal, that district is also named after Gorkha

 The thirteenth book 'gian Chantisa' could not come in the collection edited by him due to not being found in time, but he has published the rest of the thirteen as Gorakhnath's compositions
 pustaken ye hai- Many scholars in India have said many things about the time of Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath
 vastutah inke or inke samasamyik siddh jalandharnath or krishnapad ke sambandh main anek dantakathaayen prachlit hai
 Many things can be clearly known from the practice of Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath-related stories

 Let us consider them one by one
 in dantakthaon se sambhddha aitihaasik vyaktiyon kaa kaal bahut samay janaa hua rahata he
 Many historical persons are considered to be the disciples of Gorakhnath
 unke samay kii sahaayta se bhi gorakhnath ke samay kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Briggs has divided the tales based on these legends and the four broad divisions as follows- parantu upar ke pramaanon ke aadhaar par nathmarg ke aadi pravartakon kaa samay naveen shatabdi kaa madhya bhaag hi uchit jaan padataa he
 In this passage, the earlier siddhas have also been inserted later and hence there are dozens of such legends regarding Gorakhnath, which, assuming historical facts, cause date-related problems

 Clay courts are considered slow, as the ball bounces relatively high but slow, making it even harder for the player to play such a specific shot by the ball

 Therefore, clay courts are more helpful to baseline players, who are firm and generally more defensive, which has led to players such as Rafael Nadal, Jörn Borg and Justin Henin achieving considerable success at the French Open
 Offensive baseline players whose groundstrokes are very powerful have also had considerable success on clay courts

 Hallia has been the most successful female player to play on clay grounds in years, having won the French Open singles title four times and finished a 20-month development period in 2010 itself
 unke vividhta bhare shot, gati or slises unke mahatvapurn hathiyaar rahe hai
 Currently, Rafael Nadal is the most successful player on clay, winning the Punch Men's Singles French Open title - Nadal had not lost a match until 31 May 2009, before losing to Swedish player Robin Soldering
 nadal ke paas kisi bhi purush khilaadi dwaara kisi maidan par banaayi gayi sarvaadhik lambi vijay shrankhla kaa kirtiman bhi he: april 2005 se may 2007 ke bich mitti ke maidaanon par darj kii gayi 81 vijay
 mitti ke maidan par safal rahe anya khilaadiyon main margaret court, kris ewart, jorn borg, evan landal, mats villander, monica seles, steffi graph, arantksa sanches vikario or gustav kartin shaamil hai
 Justin Henin and Helen Wills Moody have combined records for the most consecutive sets won by Roland Garros by women players, both of whom won 40 consecutive sets, although their record was Open Era Me, making it even more rare

 kris ewart ke paas mahila or purush donon hi virgon main mitti ke maidan par sarvaadhik lambi vijay shrankhla banaae kaa kirtiman he: agast 1973 se lekar 12 may 1979 tak, unhone lagaataar 125 mitti ke maidaanon par khele gaye match jite
 Thomas Muster is also considered a successful player on these grounds
 haalanki unhone sirf ek hi baar french open main jeet hasil kii he, lekin unke karier ke 44 main se 40 ekal khitaab mitti ke maidaanon par hi jite gaye hai
 a clay-court specialist is a tennis player who performs exceedingly well on clay grounds, but is not able to perform at the same level on hard grounds, grasslands, or other grounds
 yah vaakyansh ausat khilaadiyon ke sthaan par adhikanshtah atipi yaa dabluti daure vaale peshewar khilaadiyon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 To some extent due to the advancements in racket technique, today's clay courts are famous for long and winning groundstrokes that produce full topspin shots, these are strokes that are very quick on the grounds that are fast and do not bounce the ball too much
 Are not very effective
 clay-court visheshgy khilaadi anya khilaadiyon kii peksha mitti ke maidaanon par gend ko bahut badhiya dhang se ghumaav de pate hai
 Many of them also specialize in drop shots, which is effective because a bouncy shot in earthen fields forces players to go far beyond the baseline
 iske atarikt, dhime or lambe uchhalayukt shot ke liye khilaadiyon dwaara oonche darje ke maansik kendrikaran or shaareerik kshamta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There are many different definitions of "clay-court specialist", some placing players such as Thomas Muster, Sergi Bruguera, Gustav Curtain and Juan Carlos Ferrero under this category, while these players have also won contests on other grounds
 haalanki, chunki in sabhi khilaadiyon ne sirf french open main hi khitaab jite hai, isliye kabhi-kabhi inhen isi upnaam dwaara hi janaa jaataa he
 Other players, such as Sereggi Bruguera, Albert Costa and Guston Gaudio, were champions of the French Open, having won all or almost all of their titles on clay grounds
 mahila khilaadiyon ke bich, bahut kam hi khilaadi ansi thim jinke shreshth pradarshan mitti ke maidaanon tak hi simit rahe hon

 In recent years Clay Court has tried to perform well on other grounds as well and has achieved some success
 ferrero, 2003 america open ke final main pahunch gaye, isi varsh unhone french open bhi jeeta or hardcourt pratiyogitaayen bhi jeetin
 nadal bhi ghaas ke maidaanon par chaar vimbledon final, 2009 main hardcourt main australian open or 2008 main hardcourt main olympic ekal swarna padak, jeetne se pehle tak ek clay-court visheshgy khilaadi maane jate the, nadal ne apane karier kaa grand slam 2010 yues open main puraa kiya or hardcorts main paanch master sheersh jite, chaar lagaataar french open sheershak jeetne ke baad lagaataar 81 match jeetne kii shrankhla banaayi
 Jain literature is very vast
 adhikansh main vah dharmik sahitya hi he
 This literature has been written in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 mahavir kii pravritiyon kaa centre magadh rahaa he, isaliye unhone yahan kii lokbhasha ardhamagadhi main apana upadesh diya jo uplabdh jain aagmon main surakshit he
 These are 45 and consider Shwetambara Jain evidence, not Digambara Jain
 dingbaron ke anusaar aagam sahitya kaaldosh se vicchhinn ho gaya he
 Digambara accepts the hetkhandagam which has been considered part of the 12th Anglicism
 digambaron ke pracheen sahitya kii bhashaa shauraseni he
 Later, Jain pundits enriched the language literature by writing their compositions in the later folk-languages of Apabhransh and Apabhransh
 adikalin sahitya main jain sahitya ke granth sarvaadhik sankhya main or sabase pramanik rup main milte hai
 Jain creators composed a variety of texts like Purana poetry, Charit poetry, Katha poetry, Ras poetry
 swayambhu, pushp danta, hemchandra, somprabh suri aadi mukhya jain kavi hai
 He also made the folk tales prevalent among Hindus the subject of his creations and showed his culmination to be different from tradition
 jain-sahitya kaa pracheenatam bhaag ‘aagam’ ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 These proceeds are 46- aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa or buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 jain parampara ke anusaar mahavir nirvana ke 160 varsh pashchaat magadh deshon main bahut baari dushkaal padaa, jiske falswaroop jain bhikshuon ko anyatra vihaar karnaa padaa
 At the end of the period, Shramana gathered in Pataliputra and eleven organs were compiled piece by piece, the twelfth organ was not remembered, so it could not be compiled
 is sammelan ko 'patliputra-vaachana' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After some time, when the Agama literature began to be severed again, the second conference of Jain monks took place after 827 or 840 years of Mahavir Nirvana
 ek aryaskandil kii adhyakshata main mathura main tathaa doosraa nagarjun suri kii adhyakshata main valbhi main
 The conference at Mathura has been called 'mathuri-vachana'
 tatpashchaat lagbhag 150 varsh baad, mahavir nirvana ke 980 yaa 993 varsh baad valbhi main devardhigani kshamashraman kii adhyakshata main saadhuon kaa chauthaa sammelan hua, jisamen suvyavasthit rup se aagmon kaa antim baar sankalan kiya gaya
 It is called by the name of 'valabhi-vachana'
 vartmaan aagam isi sankalana kaa rup he
 The history of the above three conferences of the Jain Agama shows that Agama literature suffered from time to time, and this literature in its original form could not remain secure
 yahi kaaran maaloom hota he ki baudhon ke vipul sahitya ke mukaable yah sahitya bahut nune he, tathaa is sahitya main vikaar aa jane se hi sambhavtah digambar sampradaay ne ise maananaa asweekaar kar diya
 This literature depicting the economic and social condition of India from the fourth century BC to the fifth century CE is of importance in many respects
 ayaarang, sooyagdan, uttarajaiyan, dasveyali aadi granthon main jo jain bhikshuon ke aachaar-vichaaron kaa vistrut varnan he, vah baudhon ke dhammapad, suttanipat tathaa mahabharat aadi granthon se bahut anshon main mail khaataa he, or dow
 vinternij aadi vidwaanon ke kathananusaar vah shraman-kavy kaa pratik he
 In terms of language and subject etc
, this part of Jain proceeds seems to be the oldest
 bhagwati kalpasutra, ovaiy, thanang, niryavali aadi granthon main shraman bhagavan mahavir, unki charya, unke upadeshon tathaa tatkaaleen raja, rajkumaar or unke yuddh aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisase jain itihaas kii luptpraaya anek anushrutiyon kaa pataa lagata he
 Nayadhammakha, Uvasagadasa, Antagadadasa, Anuttarovvaiyadsa, Vivagasuya, etc
, have many stories and stories told by Mahavira and his disciples, in which many things related to Jain tradition are introduced
 rypanesi, jeevabhigam, pannavna aadi granthon main vaastushastra, sangeet, vanaspati aadi sambandhi anek mahatvapurn vishyon kaa varnan he jo praayah anyatra uplabdh nahin hota he
 Aanthasutras have a detailed description of the dieting and atonement etc
 of the sages, which can be compared with the Vinayapitaka of Buddhists
 vrihatkalpasutra main bataaya gaya he ki jab mahavir saket subhumibhag naamak udyaan main vihaar karte the to us samay unhone apane bhikshu-bhikshuniyon ko saket ke purv main ang-magadh tak dakshai ke kaushambi tak, tathaa uttar main kunala tak vihaar karne kii anumati di
 This shows that initially the propagation of Jainism was limited, and Jain Shramans could not go elsewhere except Magadha and parts of Uttar Pradesh
 nissandeh chhedsutron kaa yah bhaag utana hi pracheen he jitne swayan mahavir
 Subsequently, Jain inscriptions of Mathura, contemporary to King Kanishka, mention different ganas, clans and branches, they often coincide with the ganas, clans and branches mentioned in the Kalpasutra of Bhadarwahu
 isse bhi jain aagam granthon kii pramanikta kaa pataa chalata he
 In fact, till this time, the difference between Shwetambar and Digambar is not known in Jain tradition
 jain aagmon ke vishay, bhashaa aadi main jo pali tripitak se samanta he, vah bhi is sahitya kii pracheenta ko dyotit karti he
 Like the fables of Pali Sutras, several commentaries, commentaries, Deepika, retirement, description, Avachoori etc
 have also been written
 is sahitya ko saamanyata niryukti, bhashya, churni or tikaa-in chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he, aagam ko milakar ise 'paanchangi' ke naam se kehete hai
 Like Agama literature, this literature is also of great importance
 isamen aagmon ke vishay kaa vistaar se pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 There are many recommendations in this literature, which are historically very important
 vrihatkalpbhaashya, vyavahaarabhashya, nishithchurni, aavashyakchurni, aavashyaktikaa, uttaradhyayan tikaa aadi tikaa-granthon main puraatatv sambandhi vividh saamagree bhari padi he, jisase bharat ke reeti-rivaaj, meley tyohaar, sadhu-sampradaay, dushkaal, baadh, chor-lutere, saarthwah, vyapaar ke maarg, shilp, kala, bhojan-shaastra, makaan, aabhushan, aadi vividh vishyon par bahut prakaash padataa he
 This literature is also very important in terms of folklore and philology

 Chauri Chaura is a town near Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh where on 4 February 1922 Indians set fire to a police post of the British government, killing 22 of the police personnel who were hiding in it
 is ghatana ko chaurichaura kand ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 As a result, Gandhiji said that the non-cooperation movement was no longer appropriate due to violence and it was withdrawn

 In 1992, the opinion was held and the public decided to divide the country
 1 janvari 1993 ko desh bina kisi hinsa ke do alag rashtron main baant gaya jinhen check ganatantr or slovakia ke naamon se janaa jaataa he
 This division happened so softly and peacefully in comparison to the divisions of other countries in the world that historians and reviewers sometimes call it a 'velvety divorce'

 bhuprushthiya parivartanon ke adhyayan ko bahudhaa gatikeey bhuvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 It is clear that this name refers to the dynamic state of the dorsal environment, but nowadays this name is not particularly popular and physical geology is more prevalent in its place
 is vigyaan ke teen mukhya ang hote hai, jo is prakaar hai : Transportation of surface rocks by decay, erosion and denudation and sedimentation, etc
 avsaad kaa sanchayan tathaa Addition and consolidation of accumulated depression jo prakritik kaarak prishthiya padaarth ko prabhavit karte hai, ve apane kreedakshetra kii paristhiti ke anusaar do vargon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai : Surface and aantbhom Among them, the functional energies of the surface factors mainly and dynamically originate from the Sun
 is varg main vayumandal ke vibhinn avyav, varsha ityadi, aantbhom jal or sote, nadi tathaa himandi, samudr tathaa jhil vishesh ullekhneey hai
 Their playground is mainly the land area of the geosphere, which will also include the coastline
 samudr ke nital par inkaa kuch prabhaav nahin padataa or prishth ke gahare bhaagon main bhi inaki praveshyata apekshaakrit ati sookshm hoti hai
 The main source of the energy of visceral factors is the internal heat of the earth
 is varg main patalvirupan jwalamukhi krida, ushn or bukamp ityadi aate hai
 It is clear that their original playing area is below the surface and the effects generated from them are sometimes above the ground and never come
 vayumandal main chaar aise mukhya avyav hai jo bhuprishth ke prati kaaryshil rahete hai: varsha, taap parivartan, tushaar or vaayu
 Rainfall is a very common, but extremely powerful factor
 iske kaary kii vidhi kuch rasinic or kuch balkrit hoti he
 Absolutely pure water often lacks the ability to carry out chemical reactions
 yadhyapi varshajal prithvi par pahunchne se purv adhikansh shuddh hota he, phir bhi akaashmaarg se aate samay usamen vayumandaleey oxigen or carbon dioxide donon hi paryaapt maatra main villin ho jate hai
 By the reaction of oxidized and carbonized rainwater, many minerals of dorsal rocks are converted into oxides and carbonates according to their nature
 kuch khanij, athwa anke anu, jal ke saath rasinic yogic hydrate bhi bana lete hai
 In this way, the rocks are decomposed by the chemical activity of the Salalaya
 nae bane hue padaarthon main kuch viley hote hai or kuch aviley
 With the formation of solute fragments, they dissolve in water and insoluble fragments are left there
 aviley bhaag main mitti ke anu or baaluu ityadi hote hai, jo kalantar main sanchit hokar vividh bhanti kii mitti ke str banaate hai
 Sometimes the insoluble material does not get an opportunity to accumulate, but the rain water flows on the ground completely or partially, carrying it with you
 jab tak jal main padaarth ko baha le jane kii shakti rahati he, tab tak vah bahata chalaa jaataa he or shakti ke ksheen hone par vah jahaan tahaan baith jaataa he
 In this way, it is called the matter that is shed by rainwater
 isaki maatra dharaatal kii dhaal or varsha kii gati par nirbhar hoti he
 Both the slope gradient and the intensity of rainfall increase the power of rainwater to flow
 varsha kii kriya ke parinaamon par sthaneey jalwaayu kaa bhi bahut prabhaav padataa he, yadi do pradeshon main vaarshik varsha kii maatra praaia: samaan ho, kintu ek main halake halake chhinte baar baar padate hon or duusare main kabhi kabhi kintu bahut teevr varsha hoti ho, to in donon pradeshon main varsha kaa prabhaav bhinn bhinn hoga
 In the same way, the effect of rainfall is completely different even in the alternating regions of dry and rainy seasons
 taap kii vibhinnata kaa bhi varsha kii kriyasheeltaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In tropical countries, the power to decompose rain water is much higher than in cold countries
 baari baari se garmi or sardi ke prabhaav main padakar chattaane shanai: shanai: chhin bhinn hokar mote yaa maheen chure ke rup main parivartit ho jaati hai
 It is a common quality of matter that it spreads under the influence of heat and shrinks when it gets cold
 failane evam sikudne kii maatra dravyavishesh par nirbhar hoti he, arthath koi dravya adhik failata he or koi kam
 Many rocks are made of two, three or more minerals
 at: din kii garmi main ye sab khanij apane apane gunon ke anusaar failte hai or raatri main thande hote hue sikudte hai
 The algal mineral is less dispersed, the more the algal
 jo khanij adhik failata he, vah dusron par ek prakaar kaa dabaav daalata he jisase kan chhin bhinn hone lagate hai
 Day by day due to this process, the effect increases and over time the upper layers of rocks become powdery
 pratyaksh he ki din or raat ke taap main jitna hi adhik antar hoga, utane hi adhik veg se shilaayein chhin bhinn hongi
 In this process the chemical composition of minerals does not change at all, only the mutual bonds of the minerals become so loose that they separate from each other
 isi se is kriya ko vighatan kehete hai
 By the combined action of both precipitation and temperature change, which are often in nature, shilaon ke apghaton or vighatan donon ko protsaahan miltaa he
 The action of frost is also only strengthened
 is kaarak kii shakti kaa strot yah saamaanya vrutt he ki 4 degree sein0 par jal kaa aapekshik ghanatv adhiktam hota he
 This causes the density to decrease when it becomes more frosty, that is to say, in other words, the volume of water increases
 0 degree sein0 par jab jal barf main roopantarit hota he, tab uskaa aaytan praaia: dashamang bad jaataa he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep in mind that during the installation of ice by artificial method, there should be a blank space in the vessel for increased volume of snow
 is sthaan ke abhaav main failati hui barf ke dabaav se paatr ke foot jane kii ashanka haati he
 According to this circle, when rocks in cold countries come under the influence of frost, their limbs become disjointed
 shilaon ke chhidron or vidaron main jal ghus jaataa he or vah prati din sardi paane par jamata he or garmi paane par pighalta he
 This makes the elements of the upper layers of the rocks weak and often unrelated in some time
 baad main varsha tathaa vaayu aadi ke aghat se ve sahaj hi chur chur ha jate hai
 Often this effect of blight is explosive
 sheetapradhan dashon ke un bhaagon main jahaan vanaspati kam ho, khuli, anaachhadit chattane is prakaar toote hue shail khandon se dhaki rahati hai evam pahadiyon ke talon main is prakaar se bane khandon kii badi rashiyaan ekatrit ho jaati hai, jise shailamalaba kehete hai
 These segments have no fixed shape and their corners are often pointed and sharp
 shail vighatan ke liye tushaar bahut hi shaktishaalee kaarak he, kintu iskaa kaaryakshetra keval sheetapradhan pradesh hi he
 Typical playground areas of the air are deserts and high altitude regions, where it flows most often
 anukool paristhitiyon main isamen balkrit apradan karne kii apurv kshamta hoti he
 The main secret of its power lies in the fact that it blows away countless small sand and soil particles at great speed
 prachand vaat main behate hue ye kan barambar ek duusare se takaraate hai, jisase apgharshan hota he or shanai: shanai: kan laghutar hote jate hai
 Also, the mountains, rocks and stone blocks that come in the path of the storm, on top of them, they also blow like sand, due to which all of them are defiled
 saadharantaya baaluu dharaatal se adhik oonchaai tak nahin uth paati
 For this reason, the height of the erosion-action area of the air is also limited by the same ratio
 falat: bahudhaa registani pradeshon main pahadiyon or chattaanon ke nichle bhaag to apgharshit ho patale evam sankeern ho jate hai, kintu upar kaa dhad aprabhavit chhot jaataa he
 This type of adornment makes some unique shapes like mushrooms etc
 registani pradeshon main vaayu kii disha praaia: bahut samay tak samaan bani rahati he, jisase inaki apgharshan or apradan kii disha bhi bahut samay tak aparivartit rahati he
 For this reason, the airborne spheres in the desert are angular and flakey, rather than chubby
 vastut: inke liye golashm shabd anupyukt he or uske sthaan par german shabd dricanter kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Air has the unique power of transport along with erosion
 maheen baaluu or dhul ke kanon ko bade vishaal pariman main vaayu varsh prati varsh registani pradeshon se udaakar le jaati he or aise sthanon main nickshepit kar detii he jahaan uskaa veg kam ho jaataa he or ghaas evam jhaadiyaan uske maarg main rukaawat daalati hai
 In this way, the deposits of the transported substance are called aerated sand and aerated clay
 uttari china main is prakaar se bani vaiudh mrittika kaa ek bada vishaal nikshep hai, jisaki motaai 300 se 450 meter tak he or jise vaayu madhya asia ke registaanon se uda kar yahan le ai he
 Some part of the water brought by rain goes back into the atmosphere by evaporation, some flows into the sea by the way of flowing rivers and some gets absorbed into the earth
 jo bhaag dharaatal par bah jaataa he, use apvaah kehete hai or jo prishth main ant:sravit hota he, use bhumigat athwa aantbhaum jal kehete hai
 The reciprocal ratio of these three parts depends on the local climate, topography and geology
 adrr jalwaayu ke pradeshon main vashpikaran kii maatra prabal hoti he
 In areas of similar climate, the amount of runoff water increases with the heterogeneity of the topography
 bhoumiki kaa vrutt bhi atyant mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki kuch shilaayein bahut randhri to hoti hai, par saath hi unki praveshya bahut alp hoti he, jese shail or mrittika
 Apart from these, a third category of rocks is neither random nor pervious, like granite
 at: ant:sravit jal kii maatra sthanvishesh ke shailon ke bhautik lakshanon par nirbhar hoti hai
 Upon reaching some depth in the ground, the land and rock are saturated with water
 santrupti kii sataha ko bhunmalaj str kehete hai
 Depth of this level is dependent on the amount of annual rainfall of the particular area, the topography and the local geological structure
 saadharantaya bhumjalantar sookhe pradeshon kii apeksha adrr kshetron main dhartal ke sameep hota he
 Even in the adjoining parts of the sea, lake, lake and big rivers, this level is relatively close to the surface
 sookhaa pad jane se yah gaharaai main chalaa jaataa he or ati vrishti hone par upar aa jaataa he
 The depth to which the visceral water can penetrate the surface is also dependent on the composition of local rocks
 jal shailakanon ke bich ke randhri sthanon or vivaron main samaa jaataa he, at: jitani gaharaai tak shailon main randhra, athwa vidar honge, utani hi dur tak aantbhaum shailon ke dabaav ke kaaran adhikansh vidar main sandhital band ho jate hai
 Stagnation can also be short
 aisi sthiti main aantbhaum jal adhik gaharaai main na jaakar pashrv kii ore agrasar hone lagata he
 Ultimately, its target is the sea
 kabhi to yah bhumigat margo se hi vahaan pahunch jaataa he or kabhi use aise maarg mil jate hai, jinase vah pun: dharaatal par soton ke rup main pahunch jaataa he
 In addition to open and wide walls and resources, the flow of visceral water elsewhere is very slow
 isi kaaran usamen kisi prakaar kii balkrit kriya karne kii shakti nahin hoti, kintu anukool paristhitiyon main yah rasinic kriya avashya kar saktaa he
 Moving transverse to the fissure and backbone, it, like rainwater, oxidizes, carbonizes, or hydrates the minerals of the walls of the walls, thus decomposing the shell
 jis bhubhag main chuunaapatthar ke shail hon, vahaan aantbhaum jal ko kaary karne kaa bahut bada kshetra mil jaataa he
 Limestone dissolves in carbonized water
 at: chuunaapatthar ke sttaron main se bahata hua jal uske anekanek bhaagon ko villin kar guphaayen bana daalata he
 Sometimes the size of this type of caves is large, up to several hundred meters long and 4-5 meters deep and the flowing water from these forms the gut river
 kahin kahin carbonatoyukt jal gupha kii chat se tapakane lagata he
 Some part of the dripping water evaporates and evaporates and the solute calcium carbonate precipitates at the dripping site
 ek hi sthaan par boondon ke barambar tapakane ore usee sthaan par calcium carbonate ke nirantar avakshepan se ek stambhakar raashi ban jaati he, jise stellectite kehete hai
 Similar action is also caused by evaporation of the dripping water on the floor of the cave and from that the precipitated carbonate forms a columnar shape that rises from the floor to the ceiling
 in akritiyon kii stalegmite kehete he
 Sometimes stalagmites move towards each other to form a continuous column from the roof of the cave to the floor
 kabhi is prakaar avakshepit carbonate kii raashi kaa koi vishisht rup nahin hota
 In this case it is called calc nisad, tufa or travertine
 kinhin kinhin gufaaon main is prakaar avakshepit carbonate kii maatra itani vishaal ho jaati he ki aise carbonate se vyavsaay chal saktaa he
 It has been mentioned above that sometimes the gut water returns to the ground again as springs
 yah ghatana sthaneey shailon ke vishisht vinyas ke upar nirbhar karti he
 If a sandstone rock, su, is configured in such a way that its top and bottom are completely or often inaccessible rocks, clay, shale or other rocks of the same quality, then the intrusive water is leaking into the stomatal rock, the impermeable rock
 After reaching the upper contact level, the gradient of the levels will begin to increase in the lateral direction
 usee disha main jahaan kahin vah shail kisi prakritik kaat main anaachhadit ho pragat hoga, to us sthaan par aantbhaum jal soton ke rup main bahane lagegaa
 Often the fauna present in rocks also helps in the formation of springs
 yadi kisi bhransh ke kaaran kaai apargamya shail visthapit hokar randhri or pargamya shail ke saannnidhya main avasthit ho jaay to us sthaan par jahaan bhranshatal kisi prakritik kaat ke anuprastha anaachhadit hoga, vahaan sote footne lagenge
 The mineral water always contains a small amount of mineral matter
 jab inaki maatra bhaar ke anusaar 1 prati shat se adhik ho, tab use khanij sota kehete hai
 But in normal practice, any spring, which has some specific taste due to the mineral content dissolved in the water, is called mineral spring
 par sarsaadhaaran vyavhaar main kisi bhi aise sote ko, jiske pani main villin khanij padaarth ke kaaran kuch vishisht swaad ho, khanij sota kehete hai; kintu calcium carbonate jaise khanij bahut prachur maatra main hone par bhi kuch swaad nahin dete or magnesium ke lavan ati alp maatra main bhi swaad dene lagate hai
 The water of the springs is often subject to pressure
 pani ke baahar aate hi dabaav main kami ho jaati he or uske saath pani kii vileyata main bhi hraas ho jaataa he
 Therefore, mineral material is often precipitated at the point of origin of springs
 is padaarth kaa sanghatan praaia: churnik athwa silicy hota he or ye nikshep sanghatan ke anusaar, calk nisaad, athwa silicy nisaad kehalaate hai
 Sometimes iron carbonate, or other salts, or sulfur also precipitate
 kisi kisi sote kaa pani bahut garam hota he or kabhi kabhi pani radioective bhi hota he
 Rajgiri hot water fountain is very famous in the state of Bihar
 in soton kaa pani praayay: prishth ke bahut gahare bhaagon se aata he
 The water of some springs is not only of visceral origin but also of magmatic origin, that is, water in a remote womb containing the vapor emitted from the magmatic substance
 aise sote ko megmiy sota kehete hai
 Somewhere the water is present in such a special situation that by making a well at that place, the water automatically rises up and at some places the water rises like a fountain bouncing up to several meters above the ground
 inhen utsrut coop kehete hai
 The compulsory entry restrictions for these formation are: Intermittent water is stored inside a porous and inaccessible rock with impermeable rocks on both the top and bottom, blocking the flow of water in the direction of the level prone and water
 The original source of the water should be at such a height from the place of making the well that desirable liquid static pressure is produced, due to which the water will rise to the surface automatically when the well is formed
 Su get up madras praant ke dakshin arket jile main naiveli sthaan par, jahaan peet ke vishaal nikshep mili hai, bahut hi ullekhneey utsrut sthiti pai gai he
 The pressure and volume of the water released there are so high that peat excavation has been very difficult, and special means have to be used to control the water
 prakritik karkon main nadi bahut hi prabhavi tathaa kaaryshil he
 It performs erosion, transportation and deposition, all three types of work in great quantity
 yadhyapi varshajal ke kaary kaa mahatv kuch kam nahin he, phir bhi nadi kii kriya lambii evam apekshaakrit sankeern ghaatiyon main sankendrit hone ke kaaran, iskaa prabhaav va fal adhik spasht prathit hota he
 Like rainwater, the river water can also decompose the rocks of the bottom and sides of its valley by chemical action
 is prakaar utpann apaghatit padaarth kaa viley ansh nadi ke jal main ghul jaataa he or aviley bhaag bhi dhar ke saath bah jaataa he
 The river performs this action smoothly in the path of its mountainous region, because the ghar is so heavy there that the levels of new, unadulterated rocks are always uncovered, so that they come under the influence of spontaneous action
 kintu maidani pradesh main dhar kaa veg kam ho jane par, ghati kaa tal mrittika or baaluu ke aavaran se aachhadit ho jaataa he
 As a result, contact with undigested rocks also decreases
 jin pradeshon main chuunaapatthar ke shail adhik hon, vahaan rasinic kriya bahut prachur pariman main hoti rahati he, kyonki carbonati jal main chuunaapatthar sahaj hi villin ho jaataa he
 The force of chemical erosion is much greater than that required in a river
 saadharantaya shuddh jal shailon ko apgharshit nahin kar saktaa, kintu jab usamen baaluu or bajri mili ho to sthiti badal jaati he, kyonki ve donon ek duusare ko sambalit karte hai
 The water of the river imparts strength and the sand and gravels are abrasive, due to which the folds and the sides become smaller
 saath hi ve swayan bhi tah ke shailon ko apgharshit karne main bhaag lete hai
 The river's abrasive power is dependent on the intensity of the ghara and the intensity of the torrent is based on the topography
 dhaal jitani hi pravan hoti he, dhar bhi usee ke anusaar teevr hoti he
 Also, the amount of water also affects the speed of the torrent
 jal kii maatra ke saath dhar kii gati uske ghanmul ke anupaat se badhati he, arthath yadi jal kii maatra aathguni ho jaay, to dhar kii teji duguni ho jaati he
 As a result, in countries where the dry and rainy seasons are different, the erosion power of rivers increases greatly during the rainy days
 aarambh main, visheshkar kathor chattaanon ke pradesh main, nadi ke tat praaia: ekadam khadey or prapaati hote hai
 But due to atmospheric factors, the upper parts of the edges start degenerating
 isse utpann apaghatit or khandit padaarth nadi baha le jaati he
 As a result, the passage of the river valley becomes shaped over time, that is, both its sides become sloping towards the bottom
 nadi unche sthaan se bahakar samudr kii ore jaati he, at: uskaa praytn sadaiv yahi hota he ki vah thal bhaag ko katkar itnaa nicha kar de ki vah samudratal ke baraabar ho jaay
 In this way, the slope of the longitudinal passage from the top of the river to the confluence is highest towards the top and lowest near the confluence
 duusare shabdon main, nadi kaa udhrvadhar kataav ghati ke upree bhaagon main sabase adhik hota he or samudr kii ore badhane par kam hota jaataa he
 When the valley of the rivers reaches such a position that the vertical erosion stops and its valley floor becomes like the sea level, it reaches the peak level of erosion
 vah ghati, jisamen udhrvadhar kataav tivrata se pragatisheel ho, tarun kehalaati he, jo charamastar par pahunch chuki ho use vruddh evam inaki antasth avasthaa ko praudh kehete hai
 All three phases may exist in different parts of the same valley
 yadi kisi vruddh sarita kii ghati ke pradesh main vivenic shaktiyon ke prabhaav se sthalakritik parivartan ho jaae tathaa sthal vaishamy pun: utpann ho jaae to nadi kaa punaryukt ho jaataa he or vah ek baar phir udhrvadhar kataai aarambh kar detii he
 Generally, the slope of the river valley is gradual, though the slope may vary from place to place
 kintu kabhi kabhi pravannta akramik bhi ho jaati he or jal prapaat ban jate hai
 This situation especially occurs in regions where hard and soft rocks are interchanged
 mridu jal sugamawa se aparadit hokar bah jaataa he, jisase vahaan ghati ke utkeernan adhik maatra main ho jaataa he
 The rigid level is obstructive and remains where it stands
 pani uske upar se bahata hua ghati ke mridu staravaale adhik utkeern bhaag main girane lagata he
 In this way, the slope of the valley becomes obsolete and waterfalls are formed
 bahudhaa kalantar main in prapaton kaa sthaan bhi kramash: nadi ke sheersh kii ore hatataa jaataa he
 It happens that due to the fall of water from the height of the falls, the river's edge accelerates, which increases its erosion power
 prapaat ke thik neeche ek prakaar kaa dah ban jaataa he, jisamen bhanvar padane lagate hai tathaa unamem tivrata se ghumta hua pani prapaat kii diwaar ko kaatane lagata he
 In this way, the lower soil level is cut more rapidly and a type of amputation starts, causing the stern layer to come out without any delay
 kalantar main talochhedan ke or bad jane par, kathor str kaa sabase agrim bhaag ablamb ke abhaav main tuutakar gir padataa he or prapaat kaa sthaan gire hue shail kii naap ke baraabar peeche hat jaataa he
 This action keeps on happening again and again and again the position of the falls falls back and forth
 is prakaar ke apradan ke kaaran kadi chattan ke tuutane se, prapaat ke praarambhik sthaan se peeche kii ore ek gahari dhati banati chali jaati he
 The valley engraved in the shale of the confluence of the Narmada River at Jabalpur and the waterfall of Bhedaghat is a beautiful example of this incident
 vishwavikhyath nyagara nadi kaa prapaat isi prakaar bana he
 From the measurements made there, it is known that the falls often retreat one and a half meters from their place every year
 anumaanath: isi gati se praaia: 11 kilometre lambii nyagara kii ghati ko banane main 20 se 35 hajaar varsh tak lage honge
 In many other situations, waterfalls can be formed, but at every stage it is necessary to vary the speed of erosion of different components of the valley
 ye jalprapaat ghati kii tarun avasthaa ke uplakshak hote hai
 Upon reaching the peak level of erosion, the power of the river is used to cut its back
 jab ghati ekadam sidhi ho, to donon pashrv ek se katate hai, kintu thodi bhi vakrata aa jane se asamanta utpann ho jaati he
 Towards the concave side of the valley there is a greater intensity in the edge and hence there is a greater amount of erosion
 isliye vipareet uttal pashrv kii ore dhar kaa veg kam ho jane se, na keval kataav band ho jaataa he balki nadi dwaara vishmata or bad jaati he or nadi kaa maarg adhikadhik vakr hota jaataa he
 This is how the twisty bend originates
 bahudhaa in modon kaa aayam atyadhik bad jaataa he or mode bhi bahut jatil ho jate hai
 Sometimes two turns are so close to each other that the distance between them is less than the tithe or even less the distance of the river's transverse route
 aisi avasthaa main kabhi kabhi do modon ke bich sankeern greeva ko katkar, sidhe maarg se bahane lagati he or ek yaa adhik visarpi mode parityakt ho jate hai, jinhen chhaadan kehete hai
 The transport function of the river is often more effective than all the natural factors
 nijee apradan se utpann jo shail churna, bajri, baaluu or mitti utpann hoti he, vah sab nadi bahaakar samudr kii ore le jaati he, saath hi vayumandaleey karkon, vishesh kar varsha jal dwaara utpann shail churna tathaa khand bhi, kalantar main kisi na kisi maarg se nadi kii ghati main pahunch jate hai or uski dhar main pakadakar ve sab samudr kii ore dhire dhire aage badhate jate hai
 The larger blocks, which are unable to lift the river, move in transverse folding of the fold and the small particles move suspended suspended
 parivahan kii shakti dhar kii gati par nirbhar he
 If the amount of increase in speed is more, then the transport power will become 6 more
 arthath yadi gati badhkar dugani ho jaay, to parivahan shakti 64 guni ho jaaegi
 It is clear from this that during the rainy floods the transport power of the rivers as well as the amount of destruction power becomes very terrible
 ganga, brahaputra ityadi badi nadiyon ke tatavarti nivasee is vinaashkari shakti se bhali bhaanti parichit hai
 Apart from suspended sand and soil, many rivers dissolve in their water and lead them from the continental parts to the sea
 jaisaa varsha jal or aantbhom jal ke prakarnon main bataaya ja chukaa hen, unki rasinic kriya prachur pariman main hoti hai, jisase viley padaarth bhi usee anupaat main banataa hai
 All these substances eventually reach the rivers
 nadiyaan swayan bhi apni kriya se kuch viley padaarth utpann karti hai or yah sab kramash: samudr main pahunch jaataa hai
 By calculation, it is estimated that the Ganges and the Brahmaputra often transport 1100 n 106 cubic meters of soil and sand per year to the Bay of Bengal through its combined route, the amount of material transported by the Mississippi River of America per year is 200 n 106 cubic meters
 china kii hwangaho nadi itane vishaal pariman main mitti le jaati hai ki uske muhane ke paas kaa samudr milon dur tak pilaa bana rahata hai or isi se vah pit sagar kehalaata hai
 In South America, the delta which has become a land of land in the sea floor in front of the mouth of Baha'i soil and sand by the Amazon river is about 200 kilometers long
 anumaanath:, vishwa kii samast nadiyon dwaara prati varsh parivahit padaarth kii maatra 16 ghan kilometre aanki gai hai
 As mentioned in the preceding section, the transport power of a river depends on the speed of its torrent
 at: jyonhi uski dhar kii gati main hs hota he, uski lad kaa kuch ansh turant nickshepit hone lagata he
 The first important deposition center in the path of the river is at the place at the bottom of the mountain where it leaves the Parvatya region and enters the plain
 kaaphi bade bade golashyam or choti badi batiyaan, jo ghati main parvaty bhaag main sugamawa se ludhakti hui chali aati he, nadi ke maidan main pravesh karte hi tal main baith jaati hai
 In this way a deposit is formed at the bottom of the mountains, which is called alluvial cone, or fan
 doosraa mahatvapurn gati parivartan kaa sthaan nadi ke sangam ke sameep hota he
 One, the slope of the valley gets very low as it reaches there, the other sea and lake water also stops the flow
 bahudhaa dhar kaa veg itnaa kam ho jaataa he ki jowar kaa veg nadi ke veg se adhik hota he, jise jowar ke samay nadi kii dhar ulti bahane lagati hai
 The result of this is that the river near the confluence begins to deposit sediments and sediments with great intensity and fill its own valley
 avsaad ke jamaa hone se nadi kaa bahna or bhi kathin ho jaataa he or nadi cat katkar kai choti dhaaraon main vibhakt ho jaati he
 In the course of this deposited depression, a flat plain is formed, out of which many small streams flow at a very slow speed towards the sea
 yah maidan tribhujaakar hota he, jiskaa ek sheersh nadi kii ghati ke us sthaan par hota he jahaan se dhara kaa vibhaajan armbh hota he or uske saamne vaali aadhaar rekha samudr ke tat ke anuprastha hoti he
 This type of region is called delta
 nadi ke sangam par gati ke avaruddha hone se bahudhaa baaluu dirdhakaar raashiyon main nickshepit ho jaataa he, jise balukabhithti, athwa rodhika kehete hai
 The river in the area between the alluvial cone and the delta is often affected by seasonal floods and fluctuations
 baadh ke samay nadi main itnaa pani aa jaataa he jo uski ghati main nahin samaa saktaa
 As a result, it spreads far beyond the two sides
 jo pradesh is prakaar baadh ke prabhaav main aa jaataa he, use baadh maidan kehete hai
 In that part the speed of the river edge is much less than the main stream, due to which there is abundant soil and sand deposits
 iske vipareet baadh ke samay mukhya dhar kii gati saadhaaran samay kii gati se bahut adhik hoti he, isaliye vahaan apradan bad jaataa he or nadi pehle jamaa kii hui baaluu or mitti ko katkar le jaati he
 As mentioned earlier, the effort of the river is to deepen its valley, to reach the peak of erosion
 ghati kii gaharaai bad jane par bahudhaa aisi sthiti aa jaati he ki barh ke samay bhi pehle vaali baadh ke maidan tak na pahunchne paae
 In such a situation, the river creates a new floodplain
 puranavala baadh-maidan nadi vedika kehalaata he
 Often in the valleys of the river, such altars are visible on both sides, or on the same side, well above the innovative level
 kahin kahin to 2-3 yaa or bhi adhik vedicen kramash: ek duusari ke upar vibhinn talon par milti hai
 The history of the development of the river valley can be known from his studies
 unche parvatiy bhaagon or sheetapradhan deshon main thande mausam main jal ke badale him varsha hoti he
 Areas where snow-rainfall is more than the amount of snow melt during summer time are always snowed
 jis oonchaai par aisa hota he, use him rekha kehete he
 This elevation varies in different latitudes and regions, such as in the Himalayas, it usually ranges from 4,500 to 5,500 meters, the Alps Mountains 2,400 meters, and Norway only 1,500 meters
 dhruvon ke paas, vishesh kar dakshini dhruv par to samudr kaa bahut bada bhaag sadaiv himachhadit rahata he
 When coming from the sky, snow is as soft as cotton wool's cheeks
 vastut: usamen prachur maatra main vaayu mili hoti he
 When a large amount is collected, the pressure from the upper levels escapes into the lower levels and the snowflakes converge to form hard ice
 bahut vishaal pariman main ekatrit hone par gurutvakarshan ke prabhaav se, anukool sthalakritti pradeshon main barf kii raashi dhire dhire neeche kii ore khisakane lagati he or is prakaar ek nadi si ban jaati he, jise himandi kehete hai
 Later, like a river, she also builds a valley for herself
 jise vah shanai: shanai: adhikadhik gaharaa karti jaati he
 Being engraved with solid ice, glacial valleys have certain characteristics, three of which are prominent: unka nital chaudaa or kinare prapaati hote hai, jisase unka udhrv pariched chha aakaar kaa hota he, Their valleys do not spiral but go very straight for a long time and mukhya himandi or sahaayak himandi ke sangam ke sthaan par donon ghaatiyon kaa tal kramik na hokar prapaati hota he
 Due to this the valley of tributaries is called Nilambi valley
 thos hone kaaran himandi kii gati bahut kam hoti he
 At some places, only 30 centimeters move throughout the day
 kabhi kabhi veg apekshaakrit adhik bhi hota he
 Some glaciers in Alaska often rise two and a half meters in a day
 yah gati, nadi kii gati ke samaan hi, barf kii maatra or pradeshik dhaal kii pravanta par nirbhar hoti he
 On reaching the bottom of the ice line, the ice begins to melt and takes the form of an ordinary river
 himalay se aane vaali praaia: samast nadiyon ke jal kaa mul strot yah pighalati hui himandiyaan hi hai
 In regions where the snow line is often equal to the sea level, glaciers themselves fall into the sea
 aise sangamon par bahudhaa barf kii badi badi rashiyaan peeche se aanevaali barf ke dabaav se mul nadi se tuutakar pruthak ho samudr main pravaahit ho jaati he or behate behate kaaphi dur nikal jaati hai
 These zodiac signs are called the Plowy iceberg
 plavi himshail anya kaarnon se bhi ban sakate hai
 In very cold regions, sometimes it happens that glaciers retain their form even when they are near the sea, and by carving the sea level near the coast, they continue to advance their valley far and wide
 norway or sweden main is prakaar se bani ghaatiyon ke bahut udhaaharan hai evam unhen fiard kehete hai
 Like the river, the glacier also transports rocks undamaged and broken from them
 kintu donon kii kriya vidhi main bahut antar he
 Where many small and big obstacles move at the bottom of the river by rolling at the speed of the edge, there is no opportunity for them to roll in the glacier
 jo tukdaa jis dasha main barf main fas jaataa he usee avasthaa main aage badhata he
 Many pieces of rock fall here and fall on the glacier
 jyon jyon himdhar aage badhati he, ye khand bhi jyon ke tyon pade hue aage badhate hai
 As a result of this variation, where the stones transported by the river become chubby form after some time rolling and colliding with each other, the sections carried by the snowfall remain angular and pointed until the end
 iske atirikt dhar kii sahaayta se nadi apane parivahit padaarth ko aakaar or ghanatv ke aadhaar par pruthak pruthak bhaagon main vibhakt kar detii he, yatha tej dhar kii jagahon par keval moti bajri, usase kam tej dhar main moti baaluu evam gati ke kramash: or kam hone par maheen baaluu or mitti baari baari se ghati kii tah main jamaa hoti he
 In contrast, glacial material cannot be sorted in this way, but its loading consists of large ballasts, fine sand and clay, blocks of different sizes, all moving together in unison
 or jahaan himandi kaa pighalanaa armbh hota he uskaa sabakaa sab bina kisi vibhaajan ke ek saath nickshepit ho jaataa he
 The power of transport of matter in the glacier is unlimited
 shilaon ke bade khandon ko bhi himdhar usee sugamawa se parivahit kar sakati he jisase ki chote kanon ko
 Thus, where a large amount of water separated by mere rock in a river valley cannot go further apart without broken into small blocks, they continue to move in the glacial valley
 himandi kaa jahaan ant hota he or barf pighalati he, vahiin ye bade bade khand gir padate hai
 They have no maternal connection to the local territorial rocks, hence they are called displaced blocks
 himandi se dharaatal par girte samay jis pahal par bhi ye tik jaayan, usee par tike hue anek kaal tak khadey rah jate hai
 Sometimes they fall on only a small corner and stand on the same
 aisi sthiti main inkaa santulan bada sthir sa dikhaai padataa he or inhen du:sthit khand kehete hai
 The snow-clad sections near the base of the valley scratch the folding stones from their pointed corners
 barf ke dabaav or shilaon kii kathorta ke anusaar, ye kharonchen kam yaa adhik gahari hoti hai
 Sometimes many small small blocks pass close by
 un sabaki ragad se ek hi shila main anek kharonchen ban jaati hai
 The rubbing of these blocks takes place in the direction of glacial flow, so all the scratches are parallel to each other
 is prakaar kharonchi hui shilaon ko rekhanvit kehate hai
 In contrast to this, it is sometimes the case that a rock, trapped near the glacier in the glacier, moves forward by rubbing through the hard rocks of the valley folds, so that its top edge is smooth and fruitful and the other end is angular
 And fangs are left
 is prakaar himandiranjit pahaldaar khand banate hai
 Sometimes the mounds of rocks located in the glacial valley become very smooth due to the abrasion of snow and their western corner falls
 adhikansh chikanahat tile ke us bhaag main hoti he jo dhar kii vipareet disha main hota hai, kyonki barf aage kii ore ragad detii hui badhati hai
 In the case of Bhagaparvsh, it is left as it is, retail and edgy
 is prakaar ke tilo ko raash muhane kehete hen
 Mostly, the glacial rocks carry sections of the rock on their top floor
 ghati ke kagaaron kii chattaanon tushaar aadi ke prabhaavavash samay par tuutati rahati hai, jisase shailakhand evam churna himandi ke upar uske kinaaron ke paas girte rahete hai or is tarah himandi ke donon kinaaron par parivahit padaarth ko pashrv moren kehete hai
 Initially over the central part of the glacier, rocks are usually not present at all, because that part is away from the edges of the valley
 par do him-nadiyon kaa sangam hone par ek ke dahni ore tathaa duusari ke bai ore ke more na paraspar mil jate hai or sangam ke aage se madhya moren ban jaataa he
 Finally, where glaciers cease and water is formed by the melting of ice, all the material brought to and between the ice surface collapses
 ise agrantasth moren kehete hai
 There is an absolute lack of stratification
 yadi jalwaayu main parivartan, yaa kisi or kaaran se himandi apni pehali seemaa se agragami hone lage, to barf pehle bane hue agrantasth moren kii samast raashi ko aage dhakelti hui chalegi
 Conversely, if the glacier moves towards the top, one layer of the frontal moraine will be formed backwards
 dharaatal ke teen chauthai bhaag par aadhipatty hote hue bhi samudr apana vistaar badhaane ke liye nirantar prayatnsheel rahata he
 Apparently his field of work is the neutral region, where he tries to make the continent flattened equal to its surface, dislodging the rocks by its strong waves, destroying the bumpy roughness of the land
 yon to shant mausam main bhi lehren baar baar chattaanon se takaraakar unhen aghat pahunchaati hai, par tufaan ke samay to unki shakti sahastron guna adhik ho jaati he
 The waves of large storms often rise 14–15 m high
 unke dwaara phenkaa hua phen, bajri or chote rode 40-50 meter unche uchhalte hue dekhe gaye hai
 Each wave strikes the coast with the weight of all its water, and it seems as if nature is beating the neutral region with a very large cube
 lehren paroksh dhang se bhi apni apardi kriya main sahaayta leti hen
 All rocks have fine cracks and small holes
 jab lehren jor se aakar achaanak chattaanon se takaraati hai, tab in daraaron or chhidron main bhari hui hawa ko baahar nikalne kaa avasar nahin mil paata or vah jahaan kii tahaan dabakar sankuchit ho jaati he
 At the time of the return of the waves, the air expands again when the water pressure is removed
 yah kriya itani shidhrata se hoti he ki achaanak faili hui hawa ko baahar nikalne kaa maarg bhi nahin mil paata or vah ek prakaar se visphotak shakti kaa kaary karti he
 By repeating the action repeatedly, the cracks around the crevices and holes start to break and the holes become larger respectively
 kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki daraaren samudr or mahadesh donon kii ore khuli hoti hai
 In such a state, when the pressure is exerted by the waves, the crack air escapes rapidly towards the ground and upon return of the waves, it enters the crack again as fast
 baar baar aisa hone se maheen chhidr bade hote jate hai or kramash: surangen ban jaati hai, jinhen fadhamichhidraf kehete hai
 In this way, the neutral rocks gradually begin to rise at the height of the waves, which makes the longitudinal rock of the upper rocks also weakened and they also collapse
 gurutvakarshan bhi is kriya main bahut kuch bhaag letaa he
 Where there are many types of rocks, some weak and some hard, there are more facilities for the waves, virtually any natural agent to do its work; Because when the weakened rock is cut, the base of the hard rock in contact with it also becomes weak and its personal hardness decreases
 laharon ke prabhaavavash chattaanon ke tuutane se vividh aakaar ke tukdon ko to lehren teji se ludhakaakar chattaanon par de maarthi hai, jisase ve swayan bhi tuutakar chote tathaa golmatol ho jate hai
 This increases the power to hit the sea even more
 kalantar main tukade bajri main parivartit ho jate hai
 After that, the waves do not let them rest for a moment, constantly moving back and forth with them
 falat: kuch samay baad bajri ke tukade bahut maheen or ekadam golakaar ho jate hai, kabhi kabhi itane chote ki tah main baith bhi nahin pate or pani main latake rah jate hai
 In this way the force of the particles to be small and galloping is far greater than that of the river, because the speed of rubbing in the bottom of the river is only in one direction, towards the flow of the river, the other is in the lower part of the river valley
 When the edge is reduced, large particles remain as they are, and thus their action of progressively smaller stops
 jowarbhata or anya prakaar se utpann hui samudri dharaayen bhi laharon ke kaam main sahyog detii hai
 They have a particularly notable effect in the narrow valleys of rivers near the confluence, where strong currents arise due to tides, which attempt to decay the sandy ridges and submerged rocks in the water
 ye dharaayen mitti or baaluu ko nadi ke muhane tathaa samast samudratat ke paas se bich samudr kii ore bahut dur tak baha le jaati hai
 The impact of the impact of waves is not limited to the land above the surface of the water, but also to the bottom of the shallow parts of the sea
 anubhav se maaloom hota he ki praaia: 30 meter kii gaharaai tak unki kshay karne kii shakti kaaryshil rahati he
 The work of waves below the surface is often the same as that of cutting out the growing grass, that is to say, the waves try to create a flat spot by removing the disparity in the height of the rocks submerged in the sea by their shock
 
 sthaan sthaan par samudr kii gaharaai naapane se maaloom hota he ki samast bhubhag ke chaaron ore praaia: 30 meter kii gaharaai par ek chauras maidan sa he
 This plain is called the sea cover
 samudr or jhiilon ke prakritik gunon main keval aakaar kaa hi antar he
 The sea is a very small reservoir, where there is a very large and bottomless reservoir
 isi se jhil main uthi tarangon kaa veg evam jowarbhate kaa pariman samudr kii apeksha ati laghu hota he
 As a result, the erosive action of the lake towards the earth is often similar to that of the sea, only its quantity becomes smaller according to the size of the lake
 uparyukt vivaran main vibhinn prakritik karkon kii apardi or anaachhadi kriya evam usase utpann avsaad ityadi ke parivahan kaa vrut bataaya gaya he
 It is worth noting here that the scope of each factor is unique
 vah apni kriya se utpann aparadit evam apaghatit padaarth ko apane kriyakshetra ke sabase nichle sthaan tak le jaataa he, jahaan se samay evam vaataavaran ke anusaar doosraa kaarak use apane prabhaav main lekar apane kriyakshetra kii sabase neeche kii sataha tak le jaataa he
 For example, the decomposed material produced by the action of rainwater reaches the river through small streams and drains and then the river carries it to the sea or lake
 is prakaar tushaar dwaara utpann shailakhand gurutvakarshan ke prabhaav se pahari ke tal main pahonchte hai or phir jab tak vah kisi anya kaarak ke prabhaav main na aa jaayan, vahiin sanchit pade rahete hai
 The glacier carries the depression created by its action to its melting point
 vahaan uskaa prabhavakshetra samaapt ho jaataa he or phir vah avsaad nadi ke prabhaav main aa jaataa he
 The lowest place of Bhuprishta is the sea
 at: shailon ke apradan or apghaton se utpann avsaad kaa antim thikaana samudr hi he
 Due to the state of matter, it may be that this substance stops moving for some time at some place on the road; Nevertheless, late in the morning, sometimes at a slow pace, sometimes at a fast pace, he keeps traveling towards the sea
 avsaad ko samudr tak pahunchne kaa sabase adhik bhaar nadi ke upar he
 It has been mentioned earlier that the river has the power to classify its transported material into gravel, sand, soil etc
 on the basis of its size
 at: adhikansh avsaad motaa, madhyam or maheen teen virgon main vibhakt ho jaataa he, jo kramash: tat se adhikadhik duuri par jaakar nickshepit hote hai, arthath ek hi str ke tat ke nikatwale bhaag main kan bade or duuravaale bhaag main maheen or chote honge
 At any one place as the depression accumulates in greater quantity, the water there will also be relatively shallow and consequently the velocity of the torrent will also increase slightly
 at: samast avsaad pehle kii apeksha kuch duuri par jaakar avakshepit hoga or prayek sthaan par sanchit avsaad kuch motaa ho jayega, yatha chote kankadon tathaa bajri ke upar moti baaluu, moti ke upar maheen baaluu or maheen baaluu ke upar mitti jamaa hogi
 After some time, due to accumulation of more depression, the entire area will become more shallow again and then the deposition of depression will again reach one step further
 yadi kisi kaaran uparyukt nickshepan centre main samudr kii tah dhire dhire khiskkar nichi hone lage or khisakane kii gati avsaad ke sanchit hone kii gati ke baraabar ho to adhikadhik avsaad ke sanchit hone ke baad bhi samudr kii antat: gaharaai jyon kii tyon bani rahegi or prayek sthaan par ek hi aakaar ke kanon kaa nickshepan chirkaal tak aviraam hota rahegaa
 Another condition can also occur when the speed of sliding of the bottom of the sea exceeds the speed of accumulation of depression
 us avasthaa main prabhaav ulta hoga or avsaad ke sanchit hone par bhi samudr adhikadhik gaharaa hota jayega
 As a result, the location of deposition of particles of different sizes will progressively move towards each step
 uparyukt pehali or teesri sthitiyon main vibhinn aakaar kii raashiyon kaa ekantaran hota he or duusari sthiti main samaan aakaar kaa avsaad moti moti raashiyon main sanchit ho jaataa he
 The amount of sedimentation brought by most rivers is very low in rainfall seasons
 at: varshakaal main avsaad bahut prachur maatra main samudr main nickshepit hota he
 Often the amount of depression accumulated in the period between two successive rainfall seasons is negligible
 aisi sthiti main avsaad sanchayan ruuk rukkar hota he or ek varsha ritu main aae hue avsaad ko duusari ritu ke avsaad ke aane ke purv kuch kadaa hone tathaa dab jane kaa avasar mil jaataa he
 Overloading water helps suppress depression
 falat: uttarottar varsha rituon main aae hue avsaad pehle aae hue avsaadon se ekadam mishrit nahin hote, apitu pruthak pruthak starikaon main sanchit hote hai
 This action is called leveling
 pratyek starika kii motaai ek varsha ritu main aae hue avsaad kii maatra par nirbhar hogi
 On average it ranges from 2 to 4 millimeters
 yadi avsaad kaa nickshepan kai varshon tak satat hota rahe, to spashtatya patali patali starikaon main sthaan par kuch mote staron main avsaad sanchit hoga or in staron kii motaai avsaad aane kii gati evam us avadhi par nirbhar hogi jisamen avsaad kaa nickshepan aviraam hota rahe
 The velocity of drift and the stability of direction also have an effect on the arrangement of particles of sediment accumulated in levels
 maheen mitti or maheen baaluu ke kan jal main bahut der tak nilambit rahete hai or bahut hi shanai: shanai: tah main baithte hai
 Their deposition also occurs in relatively deep water, where the edge is completely relaxed
 aisi avasthaa main kanon ke sanchit hone kii vyavastha nirantar ek si bani rahati he or str suvyavasthti or niyamit banate hai
 The particles get enough time to freeze and the levels continue to be parallel to the sea
 iske vipareet moti baaluu or bajri ityadi ke sanchit hone kaa sthaan apekshaakrit chhichhlaa hota he
 In such places the speed of the torrent is often variable, sometimes slow and sometimes rapid
 mand avasthaa main sanchit avsaad kaa upree bhaag, teevr gati kii avasthaa main aparidit hokar bahane lagata he or jahaan dhar mand ho vahaan pun: nickshepan ho jaataa he
 Thus the deposited material is not parallel to the first layer
 iske atirikt chhichley pani main, jahaan in mote kanon kaa nickshepan hota he, bahudhaa dhar kii disha bhi badalati rahati he
 This change happens due to tides and strong wind etc
 at: dhar kii disha ke saath saath avsaadeey staron kii disha bhi sthaniyat: badalati rahati he
 Thus the levels of sedimentary rocks accumulated in shallow water are often not parallel to each other, whose angles may vary from place to place
 is ghatana ko abhaasi sanstaran kehete hai
 Sometimes there is a situation in depression areas that the imprint of water waves also gets printed in the depressive levels
 chhichley pradeshon main, vishashakar jowarbhatantar katibandh main, tarangon kaa veg itnaa adhik haata he ki vahaan nickshepit baaluu or mitti unke sanketon par naachati phirti hai or bahudhaa unhen bhi tarang rup de detii hai
 Before the arrival of new depression, if this ripple sand gets an opportunity to dry up and get some strength, then this wave form remains safe
 bhaate kii avasthaa main avsaad ko sookhne evam ddadh ho jane kaa avasar bahudhaa mil jaataa he
 Similarly, the footprints of crabs, insects, and other animals can also be protected in the depression accumulated in the tidal zone
 kabhi kabhi varshajal kii boondon se bane aghatchinh bhi in avsaadon main surakshit ho jate hai
 After the death of various types of flaky animals living in the sea, their scales start accumulating in the sea
 tarangon ke pravaah se bahudhaa ye shalk idhar udhar ludhakte rahete hai, jisase kalantar main ve tuutakar chur ho jate hai or nadi dwaara laai hui baaluu or mitti main mil jate hai
 Most of the flakes are made of calcium carbonate and thus calcium solids, sand and clay are formed
 shuddh mitti, athwa baaluu, ke str keval unheen sthanon main sanchit ho pate hai jahaan shalkadhari jeev praaia: anupasthit hon
 Sometimes the flakes are buried in depression before they break down and in that state they become safe as they are
 is prakaar surakshit shalkon ko jeevashm kehete hai
 In the deepest parts of the sea, where the sand and mud depressions brought by the river do not reach, a pure depression of the powder of shields is deposited, the amount of which can become very abundant over time
 is prakaar baaluu ke str chhichley pani main, mitti ke str apekshaakrit kuch gahare pani main or chooneydaar avsaad ke shail adhik gahare samudri bhaagon main sanchit hote hai
 In arid and temperate countries, watering occurs in abundance
 in pradeshon main yadi koi aisi jhil ho jisamen nadiyon evam varshavah dwaara laae hue jalan kii maatra bhaap banakar ud janevaale jal kii apeksha kam ho, to vah jhil shanai: shanai: sookhne lagati he or kalantar main purnataya vinasht ho ja sakati he
 Generally, some salts dissolve in the water and rainwater of the rivers
 at: jhil main nadiyon dwaara nity prati nayaa lavan padaarth aata rahata he
 The water evaporates due to the heat, but the salt is left behind
 at: jhil kaa pani uttarottar adhik lavniya athwa khaaraa hota jaataa he
 Over time, the salt may accumulate in such a large amount that the lake water becomes saturated with it
 isse adhik vaashpan se lavan avakshipt hone lagegaa, jisase avsaad lavniya ho jayega
 If the amount of sediment brought by rivers at the time of precipitation of salt is very low, pure salt levels can usually precipitate
 tibet kii anekon jhilein is kriya kii udhaaharan hai
 There is very little rainfall, due to which the lakes are getting progressively drier and the saline levels are precipitating in their layers
 pakistan ke sault ranj parvat main, khevda ke pradesh main sandha namak tathaa jipsom ke nikshep isi prakaar kisi pracheen sagar kii shakha ke sookhne se bane honge
 Similarly, due to the action of various natural agents, the erosion and erosion of the geomorphic rocks is being sustained and the depression arising from it is finally accumulating in the trough of the sea
 jyon jyon avsaad ke staron main vruddhi hoti he, nichevale staron ke upar nae aae hue padaarth kii daab badhati jaati he
 Often the pressure of sedimentary levels of 300 m thick is 80 kg per square centimeter
 at: keval 60 meter mute staron ke sanchit hone par, sabase neeche ke staron par praaia: 13 kilogram prati varg centimetre kii daab padane lagegi
 The water pressure of the reservoir is also not reduced
 prati ek meter pani kii daab 100 gram prati varg centimetre hoti he
 Due to the effect of all these pressures, the properties of depression come close together and intertwine with each other
 inke bich kaa pani nikal jaataa he or ve shushkpraay ho jate hai
 Thin, thin membranes of water can still stick to the particles and their stress helps to keep the particles interconnected
 jalaashyon athwa aantarbhom jal main saadharantaya kuch na kuch lavan villin hote hai1 jab yah jal risataa hua avsaad main se bahata he, to kuch vibhinn kaarnon se isamen kaa kuch lavan avsaad ke kanon ke bich main avakshepit hokar, uske mukt kanon ko aapas main ddadh rup se sanyojit kar detaa he or avsaad kathor, subaddh pashaan main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and silica are particularly notable among the salts used in combination
 inamen se silica kaa bandhan sabase suddadh hota he
 The type of stone formed in this way will depend on the substance of depression
 yatha baaluu ke avsaad se bana shail athwa shell, batiyon ke samooh ke sangyojan se sangutikashm ityadi banenge
 If there is a little sand in the soil, sandy rocks etc
 will form
 samudr vaa anya jalaashyon main avsaad staron athwa pararto main shanai: shanai: sanchit hota he
 The particles of depression are compressed due to their compression due to pressure and with the help of some salts and other bases
 is kriya main bhi avsaad kaa starabhav bana rahata he
 Due to depression, they are also called sedimentary rocks
 avsaadeey shail padaarth samudr athwa anya jalaashyon kii tah main bahut kaal tak sanchit hota rahata he
 In due course of time, due to the effect of a circle etc
, it can rise from the bottom of the ocean, take the form of a mountain and become part of the continent
 yah ek pralayakari parivartan hota he
 This causes the sedimentary material to form the backdrop of the action of the natural agents and, under their influence, decaying again gives rise to new depressions, which begin to deposit at the bottom of the then ocean
 is prakaar bhuprishth kaa padaarth ninratar ek avsaadeey chakra main bhaag letaa rahata he
 At the end of each cycle, the ocean and continents are reestablished and new land and water bodies are formed in them

 kundakundacharya digambar jain sampradaay ke sabase prasiddh acharya the
 He also had another name 'kaundkund'
 inke naam ke saath dakshin bharat kaa kondkundpur naamak nagar bhi judaa hua he
 According to Professor A
N
 Upadhyay, their time is first century AD, but there is no definitive evidence about their period
 shravanbelagola ke shilaalekh sankhya 40 ke anusaar inkaa dikshakalin naam 'padmanandi' tha or simandhar swami se unhen divyagyaan praapt hua tha
 Acharya Kundakund took Digambar Muni Diksha at the age of 11
 inke diksha guru kaa naam jinchandra tha
 He was a great scholar of Jainism
 inke dwaara rachit samaysar, niyamsar, pravachan, ashtapahud, or panchastikaay - panch parmagam granth hai
 He also went to Videha region
 vahaan par inhone simandhar nath kii saakshaat divyadhvani ko suna
 He was the patron and teacher of Jainism for 52 years
 ve jain saadhuon kii mul sangh kram main aate hai
 They are also known by these names in ancient texts- gautam ganadhar ke baad acharya kundakund ko sampurna jain shastron kaa ek maatr gyaata mana gaya he
 His name has an auspicious significance for the Digambars and is the third place in sacred praise after Lord Mahavira and Gautam Ganadhar- acharya kundakund tattwarthsutra ke rachiyata acharya umaswami ke guru the
 Kundakundacharya was the Principal Acharya of Mool Sangh

 They are mentioned with great respect in the Jain tradition
 shastrasabha ke aarambh main mangal bhagwaan vir ke saath-saath mangal kudakundadyo kahkar inkaa samaran kiya jaataa he jisase jain shashan main inak mahatv kaa pataa chalata he
 He has first given a logical rendering of jain-agam-agreed substances
 inke sabhi uplabdh granth praakrit main hai
 It has been his specialty that he has rendered Jainism in the light of his own philosophical ideology, and not only re-discourses of Jain proceeds
 inke vibhinn granthon main gyaan, darshan or charitra kaa nirupan miltaa he
 He wrote independent texts to describe each subject, which is called Pahud
 inke 84 pahudon kaa ullekh jain vaanmay main miltaa he
 Following are his main texts: jain darshan ko unhone ek nai drushti di he
 He is considered to be the exponent of 'transcendental imperialism'
 jain aagmon main dravya or paryaay main bhed or abhed donon mana jaataa he
 But according to them, their distinction is practical, ultimately both are integral
 isi prakaar aatma main varna kaa sadbhaav or asadbhaav donon aagamasammat hai, parantu inke anusaar vyaavhaarik rup main to varna aatma main hai, parmaarthik rup main nahin hai
 He considered the unity of body and soul in practice, but in the determination, he considered the difference between the two
 ve dravya ko satta se abhinn maanate he
 In Vaisesika philosophy, power considers matter to be true due to the general, but they say that in this opinion, matter will become dissatisfied due to separation from power
 at: dravya satta rup hi he or yahi paramtatv he
 Power develops in the form of matter, quality and substance in the country, so everything is a matter of matter
 gun or paryaay kaa dravya se abhed maananaa tathaa nayabhed se satkaryawad or satyakaryawad donon ko sweekaar karnaa, unka abhipret tha
 Regarding the atom, he says that the final component of all the wings is the atom
 yah shaashvat, shabdarahit, avibhajya or moort he
 The atom was said to be the resultant element containing senses, smell, color and touch and considered to be the origin of earth, water, light and air
 aupnishad or mahayan darshanon main vyavhaar or parmarth athwa pratibhaas or satya kaa bhed mana gaya he
 By considering this distinction, spiritualist philosophers honor an individualism
 jain darshan bhootvaadi he, aadhyatmavaadi nahin
 Nevertheless, he considered a distinction between behavior and determination
 jo saamanyat: dikhaai detaa he vah sarvada satya nahin hota or koi aavashyak nahin ki satya sadaa shuddh rup main gochar ho
 He considered three forms of the soul
 bahya padaarthon main aasakt, deh ko apane se abhinn samajhane vaali moodhaatma bahiraatma he
 When the body becomes aware, it is said that the soul that is moksamarga is the conscience
 dhyanabal se karmmal kaa kshay ho jane par jab aatma shuddh rup praapt kar leti he
 Then it is called God
 isi paramatma ko unhone shiv, brahma, vishnu, buddha aadi kahkar tatkaaleen darshan se apane ko parmarthat: abhinn ghoshit kiya he jo sambhavat: kisi jain acharya ne nahin kiya
 It is his specialty that distinguishes him from the other Jainacharyas and is a reflection of his syncretic tendency
 unhone aatma ko kaary-karan se bhinn maanakar sankhya ke kutasth purush kii kalpana ke saath samanvit kiya parantu aatma ko akarta nahin mana
 In his opinion, the soul is not the agent of non-committal culmination, but it is also considered to be the doer due to its consequential
 aatma gyaan aadi swagat parinaamon kaa to karta he hi
 He said that the element cannot be described with behavior and determination
 tatv pakshaatikrant he
 The creature is in pure form, not impaired
 bandha-abandh se vimukt jeev hi sahaysar or paramatma paramtatv kaha gaya he
 Practices are resolved with determination
 inkaa kahana he ki nishchaynay kaa aashray lekar yadhyapi tatv kaa gyaan hota he, tathaapi tatvagyan ho jane par nishchiyanay kaa bhi naash ho jaataa he

 Scientists discovered new antibiotic toxobactin
 tiksobactin naam ke nae antibiotic kii khoj masachusets ke boston main northistern uniwarsity ke vaigyanikon kii team ne kii
 This antibiotic, first discovered after nearly three decades, is capable of fighting infections that cause the deaths of hundreds - thousands of people each year
 yah khoj 7 janvari 2005 ko nechar naam ke general main online prakashit hua tha
 Texobactin antibiotics have been obtained from invertebrate bacteria using in situ cultivation or specific growth factors
 iske liye asanvardhit bacteria kaa prayog isliye kiya gaya kyonki team kaa maananaa tha ki bahari vaataavaran main maujuud sabhi prajatiyon main se lagbhag 99 fisadi nae antibiotic dawaaon ke aprayukt strot hai
 The first antibiotic penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming and since then more than 100 compounds have been discovered
 antibiotics kii khoj ke mahatvapurn dashak 1950 or 1960 ke dashak the lekin 1987 ke baad se koi bhi nayaa shrenee nahin mila tha

 agnashay sthit islands of langerhands agnyashay kaa keval ek pratishat bhaag hi hota he
 a normal pancreas consists of more than one million islands and each island has 80–100 beta cells
 ye koshikaayen prati 10 sacand main 2 milligram pratishat kii dar se blad glucose ko naapti rahati hai
 In one or one and a half minutes, beta cells provide the amount of insulin needed to maintain blood sugar levels normal
 jab madhumeh nahi hoti he to rakt-sharkara ke str ko atyadhik upar uthaanaa lagbhag asambhav rahata he
 Hence the supply of insulin is almost never exhausted
 iske alaava agnyashay main alpha naamak koshikaayen bhi hoti hai jo glucagon naamak tatv nirmit karti hai

 Abhigyan Shakuntalam is a world-famous drama by Mahakavi Kalidas, which has been translated into almost all foreign languages
 isamen raja dushyant tathaa shakuntala ke pranay, vivaah, virah, pratyaakhyaan tathaa punarmilan kii ek sundar kahani he
 In the legend, Dushyant is realized by Akashvani, but in this drama the poet has made it known by Mudrika
 isaki naatakeeyata, iske sundar cathopakathan, isaki kavy-saundarya se bhari upmaayen or sthaan-sthaan par prayukt hui samyochit sukhtiyaan; or in sabase badhkar vividh prasangon kii dhvanyaatmakataa itani adbhut he ki in drushtiyon se dekhne par sanskrit ke bhi anya naatak abhigyaan shaakuntal se takkar nahin le sakate; phir anya bhashaaon kaa to kahana hi kya ! to yaheen sabase zyada acha he
 Kalidas did not choose Abhigyan Shakuntal's story as original
 yah katha mahabharat ke adiparv se lee gai he
 Thus the story of Shakuntala is also found in Padmapuran and it is more close to the story of Shakuntala than Mahabharata
 is kaaran vinternitz ne yah mana he ki shakuntala kii katha padmapurana se lee gai he
 But scholars have said that this part of Padmapurana was written after the creation of Shakuntala and later appears projectile
 mahabharat kii katha main durvasa ke shaap kaa ullekh nahin he
 The Mahabharata is very different from Dushyant, if not exactly the opposite
 mahabharat kii shakuntala bhi kalidas kii bhaanti salajj nahin he
 She narrates the story of her birth to Dushyant as a result of Vishwamitra and Maneka's relationship with her mouth
 mahabharat main dushyant shakuntala ke rup par mugdh hokar shakuntala se gandharv vivaah kii prarthana karata he; jis par shakuntala kahati he ki main vivaah is shart par kar sakati hum ki rajsinghaasana mere putr ko hi mili
 Dushyant at that time accepts and later returns to his capital and does not deliberately accept the shameful Shakuntala
 kalidas ne is prakaar aprishkrut rup main praapt hui katha ko apni kalpana se adbhut rup main nikhaar diya he
 By imagining the curse of Durvasa, he elevated the character of Dushyanta
 kalidas kii shakuntala bhi abhijatya, saundarya or karunaa kii murti he
 Apart from this, the manner in which Kalidas has performed the whole story, portraying emotions, etc
 is original and unique
 shakuntla raja dushyant kii patni thi jo bharat ke suprasiddh raja bharat kii mata or menka apsara kii kanya thi
 It is written in the Mahabharata that Shankutla was born from the womb of Maneka Apsara, who left it in the forest
 van main shankuton aadi ne hinsak pashuon se isaki raksha kii thi, isi se iskaa naam shakuntla padaa
 Kanva Rishi brought it out of the forest and kept it like a girl, keeping it in her ashram
 ek baar raja dushyant apane saath kuch sainikon ko lekar shikaar khilne nikle or ghoomte phirte kanv rishi ke ashram main pahunche
 The sage was not present there at that time; With this, the young woman Shakuntala welcomed King Dushyant
 usee avasar par donon main prem or phir gandharva vivaah ho gaya
 a few days later King Dushyant left his kingdom from there
 kanv muni jab lautakar aae, tab yah jaanakar bahut prasann hue ki shakuntla kaa vivaah dushyant se ho gaya
 Shakuntala was pregnant at that time
 samay paakar uske garbh se bahut hi balvan or tejasvi putr utpann hua, jiskaa naam 'bharat' rakhaa gaya
 It is said that the name 'bharat' was named after 'bharat'
 kuch dinon baad shakuntla apane putr ko lekar dushyant ke darbar main pahaunchi
 But Shakuntala had got the curse of Durvasa Rishi in the middle
 raja ne ise bilkul nahin pahachaanaa or spasht kah diya ki na to main tumhen jaanata hoon or na tumhen apane yahan aashray de saktaa hoon
 But on this occasion there was an All India Radio, which informed the king that this is my wife and this son is also mine
 unhen kanv muni ke ashram kii sab baaten samaran ho ain or unhone shakuntla ko apni pradhan rani banaakar apane yahan rakh liya
 'abhigyan Shakuntalam' mentions many touching episodes
 ek us samay, jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa pratham milan hota he
 Secondly, when Kanva leaves Shakuntala from her ashram for her husband's house
 us samay to swayan rishi kehete hai ki mere jaise rishi ko apni paalita kanya main yah moh he to jinaki oras putriyaan patigrih ke liye vidaa hoti hai us samay unki kya sthiti hoti hogi
 The third episode is Shakuntala's presence at Dushyant's meeting and Dushyant's refusal to recognize her
 chauthaa prasang he us samay kaa, jab machuaare ko praapt dushyant ke naam vaali anguthi usko dikhaai jaati he
 And the fifth episode of the union of dushyant-shakuntala in the ashram of Maarishi Maharishi
 shakuntala main kalidas kaa sabase bada chamatkaar uske dhvanyatmak sanketon main he
 In this, the poet has had a unique success in that he did not use any object anywhere
 koi bhi paatr, koi bhi cathope-kathan, koi bhi ghatana, koi bhi prakritik drishy nishprayojan nahin he
 All the events give a miraculous indication of the events ahead
 naatak ke prarambh main hi greeshm-varnan karte hue van-vaayu ke patal kii sugandhi se milakar sugandhit ho uthne or chaaya main letate hi neend aane lagane or diwas kaa ant romantic hone ke dwaara naatak kii katha-vastu kii mote taur par soochna de di gai he, jo kramshah pehle shakuntala or dushyant ke milan, uske baad neend-prabhaav se shakuntala ko bhul jane or naatak kaa ant sukhad hone kii suchak he
 Similarly, the initial song of the play by the illusors kissing the flowers of Shirish a little bit indicates that Dushyant and Shakuntala's union would be short-lived
 jab raja dhanush par baan chadaaye harin ke peeche daude ja rahe hai, tabhi kuch tapasvi aakar rokte hai
 It is said - 'maharaj' this is the stag of the ashram, do not shoot arrows at it
 ’ yahaan harin ke atirikt shakuntala kii ore bhi sanket he, jo harin ke samaan hi bholi-bhali or asahaay he
 'whereas the very fickle life of the stag and the hard arrow like your thunderbolt!' It also has a poignant indication of Shakuntala's helplessness and simplicity and the ruthlessness of the king
 jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa prem kuch or badhane lagata he, tabhi nepathy se pukaar sunai padati he ki ‘tapasviyo, ashram ke praaniyon kii raksha ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 The hunter king Dushyant has come here
 ’ isamen bhi dushyant ke haathon se shakuntala kii raksha kii ore sanket kiya gaya prathit hota he, parantu yah sanket kisi ke bhi kaan main sunai nahin diya; shakuntala ko kisi ne nahin bachaaya
 This increases the compassion of the situation even more
 chauthe ank ke praarambhik bhaag main kanv ke shishy ne prabhaat kaa varnan karte hue sukh or dukh ke nirantar saath lage rahane kaa tathaa priy ke viyog main striyon ke asay dukh kaa jo ullekh kiya he, vah dushyant dwaara shakuntala kaa parityag kiye jane ke liye pehle se hi prishthbhumi-si bana detaa he
 In the fifth issue, Rani Hanspadika sings a song, in which the king is praised for his sweet-heartedness
 dushyant bhi yah sweekaar karte hai ki unhone hansapadika se ek hi baar prem kiya he
 This gives the poet a serious indication that even though Shakuntala was forgotten by Dushyant because of Durvasa's curse, it was not new for him to ignore the queens once they were in love
 anya raniyaan bhi uski is madhukar-vritti kaa shikaar thim
 The incident of Shakuntala's abandonment seems even more cruel and harsh in the backdrop of this song from Hansapadika
 isi prakaar ke dhvanyatmak sanketon se kalidas ne saatven ank main dushyant, shakuntala or uske putr ke milane ke liye sukhad prishthbhumi taiyaar kar di he
 Indra King confers uncommon respect to Dushyant
 uske baad hemkut parvat par prajapati ke ashram main pahunchate hi raja ko anubhav hone lagata he ki jaise vah amrit ke sarovar main snaan kar rahe hon
 After such signs, the union of Dushyant and Shakuntala becomes even more delightful
 german kavi gete ne abhigyaan shaakuntalan ke bare main kaha tha- Similarly, this verse is famous among Sanskrit scholars- iskaa arth he - kavy ke jitne bhi prakaar hai unamem naatak vishesh sundar hota he
 In plays also, Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top in terms of poetry
