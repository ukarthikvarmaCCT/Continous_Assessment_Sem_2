 Mahadevi Varma was a poetess of mysticism and cinematism, so her poetry is clearly visible in the shadow of the union of soul-god and the trades of nature
 vednaa or pidaa mahadevi ji kii kavita ke praan rahe
 All his poetry is Vednamaya
 unhen nirashavad athwa pidawad kii kavyitri kaha gaya he
 She writes herself, sorrow is such a poem of my near life, which has the ability to bind the whole world in one sutra
 inaki kavitaaon main seemaa ke bandhan main padi aseem chetana kaa krandan he
 This anguish is different from the cosmic anguish, which can be a spontaneous sensation for one who has entered that realization
 vaise mahadevi is vednaa ko us dukh kii bhi sangya detii hai, "jo saare sansar ko ek sutara main baandhe rakhane kii kshamta rakhata he"(kintu vishwa ko ek sutara main baandhane vaala dukh saamanyatya loukik dukh hi hota he, jo bhartiya sahitya kii parampara main karun ras kaa sthaayee bhav hota he
 Mahadevi has not adopted this sorrow
 ve kahati hai, "mujhe dukh ke donon hi rup priy hai
 One, which binds the sensitive heart of man from the whole world into one unbroken bondage and the other, which is the cry of infinite consciousness bound in the bond of time and boundary "but, not the first type in his poetry, the second type The 'krantan' of the person has been expressed
 yah vednaa saamaanya lok hryday kii vastu nahin he
 Perhaps that is why Ramchandra Shukla, expressing doubt in his truth, wrote, "with this affliction, he exposed such feelings of the heart, which are extraterrestrials
 kahan tak ve vaastavik anubhutiyaan hai or kahan tak anubhutiyon kii romantic kalpana, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa"
 In the direction of this spiritual anguish, from the beginning to the end, the development and spread of the subtle and eloquent expressions of the poetry of Mahadevi is visible
 dow hazari prasad dvivedi to unke kavy kii pidaa ko mira kii kavy-pidaa se bhi badhkar maanate hai
 She viewed all human life as full of despair and agony
 ve apane ko nir bhari badali ke samaan batalaati -main nir bhari dukh kii badali
 a corner of a wide sky, i never own one
 parichay itnaa itihaas yahi- umadi thi kal mit aaj chali
 In the love story of Mahadevi Ji, there is a predominance of divine opposition
 unhone aatma kii chirantan vikalataa or brahm se milane kii aturata ke bade sundar chitra sanjoe hai-main kan-kan main daal rahi ali ansu ke mil pyaar kisi kaa
 i am rearing in the eyelids, this dream is of someone beautiful
 'agnirekha` main deepak ko pratik maanakar anek rachanaayen likhi gayi hai
 There are poems on many subjects as well
 mahadevi verma kaa vichaar he ki andhkaar se surya nahin deepak jujhataa he- The sun is not battling in the dense darkness of the night, the lamp is battling! When did Rashmi stagger, which storm reached there? Who was able to stop him for a moment, which was blown when
 
 Even before Agni Rekha, Mahadevi ji has written many songs as a symbol of the lamp - the lamp of which appliances, my lamp burns sweetly, let me burn all the extinguished lamps, let this temple lamp burn it calmly, where does the priest lamp sleep, the lamp Now Jaati Re, deep my water dissolves, unchained, asks why the rest of the night etc
 mahadevi chhayavaad ke kaviyon main auron se bhinn apana ek vishisht or niraala sthaan rakhti hai
 There are two reasons for this uniqueness - one being her soft hearted woman and the other being influenced by the romantic and mystic poetry of English and Bengali
 in donon kaarnon se ek ore to unhen apane aadhyatmik priyatam ko purush maanakar swaabhaavik rup main apana stri - janochit pranyanubhootiyon ko nivedit karne kii suvidha mili, duusari ore pracheen bhartiya sahitya or darshan tathaa sant yug ke rahasywaadee kavy ke adhyayan or apane purvavarti tathaa samakaleen chhayavaadi kaviyon ke kavy se nikat kaa parichay hone ke falswarup unki kavyabhivyanjana or bauddhik chetana shat-pratishat bhartiya parampara ke anuroop bani rahi
 In this way, while the poetry of Krishna Bhakti poetry is not directly published through the gopis, as an expression of their spiritual experience, in their poetry, like Sufi male poets, they do not need to revere the divine in the symbol of woman
 Lying
 prakruti chithran - anya rahasywaadee or chhayavaadi kaviyon ke samaan mahadevi ji ne bhi apane kavy main prakruti ke sundar chitra prastut kiye hai
 They get an idea of their beloved in nature and by that their feelings get consciousness
 ve apane priy ko rijhaane ke liye prakruti ke upkarnon se apana shringaar karti hai-shashi ke darpan main dekh-dekh, maine sulajhaaye timir kesh
 Goose Chun Tarak Parijat, Decompose the rays aloof
 chhayavaad or prakruti kaa anyonyashrith sambandh rahaa he
 According to Mahadevi ji - 'the nature of shadowism, like the uniformity of water filled with ghats and wells, etc
, became an aspiration manifested in many ways
 swayan chitrakaar hone ke kaaran unhone prakruti ke anek bhavy tathaa aakarshak chitra saakaar kiye hai
 Mahadevi ji's poem has two angles - one is that he has made an independent analysis of the conscious nature - "that figure of the world, which echoes again and again, erasing the golden pearl of the night
 athwa'taarakmay nav beni bandhan sheesh phool par shashi kii nutan rashmi valay sit avagunthan dhire-dhire utar kshitij se aa vasant rajani
 ' doosraa prakruti ko bhav-jagat kaa ang maanakar unhone mukhyatah rahasy sadhana kaa chithran kiya he
 Poetry has the curiosity to look at the other end of the horizon to see the infinite - "break this horizon, i should also see what is on that side? What is the path leading to the doubles?" unhone samast bhaawanaaon or anubhutiyon kii abhivyakti prakruti ke madhyam se kii he
 In 'sandhyagita', she compares her life to the evening evening - 'dear evening Gagan, my life made this horizon blurred mahadevi ji kii srijan-prakriya vishuddh bhavatmak rahi he
 The various debates of the era have not changed their perceptions
 unhone kisi ek darshan ko centre nahin banaaya
 Assimilated what he thought fit for life or society
 mahadevi ji vishuddh rup se bhartiya samskruti kii poshak hone ke kaaran unki samast kavy kritiyon main uskaa prabhaav parilakshith hota he
 She considers the basic philosophy of Chauism, and is considered as the means of nature - 'chhayavad gave life to the relation of human heart and nature which has been in the form of image reflection since ancient times, due to which man has to change his nature
 It seemed sad in sadness and pulkit in happiness
 ' unhone chhayavaad kaa vivechan karte hue prakruti ke saath ragaatmak sambandh kaa pratipaadan vishesh rup se kiya he
 Along with this, he has emphasized the inauguration of the subtle or aesthetic beauty of difference
 mahadevi kii kavita anubhuti se paripurna he, pant or niraala kii kavitaayen darshaniktaa ke boj se dab-si gai hai, kintu mahadevi ji ke kavy main aisi baat nahin
 Despite its philosophicalness, there is plausibility
 vah sarvatra bhaavana pradhan he
 Musicality has a special quality in Mahadevi Ji's poetry
 ve geet lekhika hai
 His amazing authority over the lyrical verses of the songs is visible everywhere
 ve mahadevi maadhurya bhav kii upasika hai
 He has seen Brahma as the Beloved
 apane premapaatr ke liye unhone 'priy' sambodhan diya he
 His songs are lyrics of Ujjwal Prem
 iske dwaara apane antar kii jis satviktaa kaa unhone parichay diya he vah unki kavy-garima kaa aadhaar stambh he
 When the ragini of the divine music of honey fell in my life, he gave birth to innumerable new dreams in the poet's mind - 'these tempted eyes were on when Vrida Kasamrajya gave me that pain of pain
 ' Everlasting soul has been anxious to meet with the universal God from time to time
 mahadevi ji kii vednanubhuti sankalpatmak anubhuti kii sahaj abhivyakti he
 She considers this viraha as the practice of life by saying 'do not take the name of the union, i am eternally alive'
 unhone pidaa kii mahatta hi ghoshit nahin kii uskaa sukhad paksh bhi spasht kiya he
 Their happiness has no independent existence
 jab dukh apni antim seemaa tak pahunch jaataa he tab vahi dukh sukh kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 'may it be the cold glow of burning, it is the limit of suffering; chhayavaadi kahe jane vaale kaviyon main mahadevi ji hi rahasyavaad ke bheetar rahi hai
 The anguish for that unknown beloved is the heart of his heart, from which many kinds of emotions keep on giving a glimpse of relaxation
 vednaa se inhone apana swaabhaavik prem vyakt kiya he, usee ke saath ve rahanaa chaahati hai
 He did not count anything beyond him
 ve kahati hai ki – milan kaa mat naam le main virah main chir hoon
 With regard to this anguish, he has put forward such sensations of heart which are extraterrestrial
 kahan tak ve vaastavik anubhutiyaan hai aar kahan tak anubhutiyon kii romantic kalpana he, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Anant Sushma in one side, immense pain in the other side, are the ends of the world between which her expression takes place - both of these were two sides
 pidaa kaa chaska itnaa he ki —tumko pidaa main dhunda tumme dhundhugi pidaa
 She considers unhappiness as an element of life and inspiration
 unki drushti main vednaa kaa mahatv teen kaarnon se he- vah antahkaran ko shuddh karti he
 Brings the beloved more closely and the beauty of the beloved is also based on the same
 atah unke kavy main dukh ke teen rup milte hai nirmaanatmak, karunaatmak or saadhnaatmak
 They do not accept the monotheism of the Buddhists
 unhone dukh ko madhur bhav ke rup main sweekaar kiya he jisamen vah alokik priy ke liye deep banakar jalanaa chaahati he-'madhur-madhur mere deepak jalyug-yug pratidin pratikshan pratipal, priyatam kaa path aalokit kar

 In the Bhagavata Purana, Maharishi Sut Goswami narrates a story to the sadhus presented to him
 sadhu log unase vishnu ke vibhinn avtaron ke bare main prashn poochhate hai
 Sut Goswami says that he had heard this story from another sage Shukdev
 isamen kul baarah sakandh hai

 shribhagwat main bharatvarsh kii mahima ke pratipadak aathon shloke devi bhagwat main aksharsh: usee kram main uddhrut hai 
 The difference in the descriptions of the two is so much that where the Srimad Bhagavat takes a natural medium of prose for the sake of the description of the subject, Devi Bhagwat uses the artificial medium of the verse to demonstrate the uniqueness
 shrimadbhagwat bhakthiras tathaa aadhyatmagyaan kaa samanvay upasthit karata he
 The Bhagavata is considered to be the self-sufficiency of Nigamakalpataru, which has been made amritamay by the natural brahmachari and the great scientist Maharishi Shuk, combined with his melodious speech

 ekadash skandh main kaveri, tamraparni, kritamala aadi dravidadeshiy nadiyon ke jal pinevaale vyaktiyon ko bhagavan vasudev kaa amalashay bhakt batalaaya gaya he
 It is considered by scholars to be a clear indication of the Alavar of the Tamil country
 bhagwat main dakshin desh ke vaishnav tirthon, nadiyon tathaa parvaton ke vishisht sanket hone se katipay vidvan tamildesh ko iske udai kaa sthaan maanate hai
 There is a substantial difference in the subject of time also
 itnaa nishchit he ki bopadev, mahadev tathaa raja ramchandra ke karnadhipati tathaa mantri, prakhyat dharamshastri hemaadri ne apane 'chaturvarg chintamani' main bhagwat ke anek vachan udhrut kiye hai, bhagwat ke rachayita nahin maane ja sakate
 Shankaracharya's grandfather Guru Gaudapadacharya has quoted two verses of Bhagavat in his 'panchakaranavyakhya', 'jagruhe Paurusam Rupam' and 'shrey: Srutiin Bhakti Mudasya te Vibho' in 'uttaragita Tika'
 isse bhagwat kii rachana saptam shatee se arvachin nahin maani ja sakati
 The following table gives the composition of Bhagavata Purana suggested by some scholars- bhagwat kaa prabhaav madhyayugiya vaishnav sampradaayon ke udai main nitant kriyasheel tha tathaa bharat kii prantiy bhashaaon ke krishna kaavyon ke utthan main vishesh mahatvashaalee tha
 Ashtaghapi, Nimbarki, Radhavallabhi poets of Braj Bhasha took radiance and inspiration from Bhagwat, singing Radha Krishna's leelas in Brajbhasha
 mithila ke vidyapati, bengal ke chandidas, gyaandas tathaa govinddas, assam ke shankardev tathaa madhavdev, utkal ke upendra bhanj tathaa dinkrishnadas, maharashtra ke namdev tathaa madhav pandit, gujarat ke narsi mehta tathaa rajasthan kii mirabai - in sabhi santon tathaa kaviyon ne bhagwat ke rasmay varnan se prerana praapt kar radhakrishna kii kamaneey keli kaa gayan apane vibhinn kaavyon main kiya he
 The influence of Bhagwat on the Vaishnava poets of Tamil, Andhra, Kannada and Malayalam is also less
 bhagwat kaa aadhyatmik drushtikon advaitvaad kaa he tathaa sadhanadrushti bhakthi kii he
 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity
 inhen kaarnon se bhagwat valmikiy ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke saath sanskrit kii 'upjivy' kavyatrayee ke antarbhoot mana jaataa he
 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings
 iske vibhinn skandhon main vishnu ke leelavataron kaa varnan badi sukumaar bhashaa main kiya gaya he
 But the tenth Skandha is the heart of Bhagwat, giving a detailed account of the fine pastimes of Lord Krishna

 ]counter In the context of digital logic and computing, a counter is a device that stores or displays the number of a particular event or process
 counter aksar ek ghadi sanket karne ke sambandh main aata he
 The use of counters in electronics can be implemented quite easily through register type circuits such as flip flops, and a wide variety of classifications exist: prayek counter vibhinn anuprayogon ke liye upyogi he
 Typically, counters are digital in circuit form, and naturally count in binary
 counter circuit ke kai prakaar digital blokon rup main uplabdh hai, udaahranarth, 4000 shrinkhalaa main chips jo vibhinn countaron ko lagu karte hai
 Sometimes it is beneficial to use a count sequence other than the natural binary sequence such as a binary coded decimal counter, a linear response shift register counter, or a gray code counter
 countaron digital ghadiyon or timer, or oven timer, visiar ghadiyon, aadi ke liye upyogi hote hai
 Asynchronous counter: An asynchronous counter is the same type of d flip flop, with j input from its own inverted output feedback connection
 yah circuit ek bit ko rakh saktaa he, yaneen shunya se lekar ek tak gin saktaa he
 This circuit makes one increment in each clock cycle and exits the circuit in two clock cycles, so it will alternate between a transition of 0–1 and a transition of 1–0
 note karen ki is input ghadi kii thik aadhi aavriti par ek 50% shulk cycle ke saath ek nai ghadi banaata he
 If this application is used to clock a similar systematic flip flop, one more counter which counts as fast as half will be found
 donon ko jod kar hamen do-bit counter mil jayega
 Most of the flip-flops can be added by reversing output, input, and using the previous output as clock
 isse hamen tarang counter praapt hoga jo 2n-1 baar ginata he, jahaan n counter ke bit kii sankhya he
 Volatile production is seen in the wave counter, where the efflux rises from stage to stage
 ye ghadi signal ko vibhakt karne kaa aavedan he jahaan samgr vibhaajan vibhaajan aavashyak or taatkaalik ginti anaavashyak he
 Synchronous counter tulykaalik countaron main sari flip-flope kii ghadiyaan ek saath jodi jaati hai or imput dwaara trigar kii jaati hai
 And all flip-flops change state simultaneously
 tulykalik counter kaa 4-bit srarkit neeche diya gaya he
 j and k of FF0 are connected to the input HIGH
 FF1 ke j or k imput FF0 ke utpaadan se jode jate hai
 The j and k inputs of FF2 are connected to the output of an AND gate, which receives the output of FF0 and FF1
 arohi counter ke har ek bit ke tark ko lagu karne ke saral tarika yah he ki har ek bit togal kare jab saare kam mahatvapurn bit HIGH avasthaa main ho
 For example, bit 1 toggles when bit is 0, bit 2 toggles when bits are 0 and 1, etc
 dashak coutonr The decade counter counts in decimal instead of counting in binary
 dashak counter dwiadhari kodit dashamalav, jaise IC 7490, main gin saktaa he, yaa binary sketikaran main
 Decade counter is a binary counter designed to count up to 1010b
 ek saadhaaran 4 stage counter main ek NAND get laga kar ham use ek dashak counter main parivartit kar sakate hai
 Observe that FF2 and FF4 are input of NAND gate
 NAND get kaa utpaadan har ek flip-flope ke CLR imput se jode jate hai
 The decade counter is counted from 0 to 1 and resets to 0 again
 riset ko LOW pulse main dekar counter ke utpaadan ko shunya kiya ja saktaa he
 The number increases by one number in each clock pulse, until it counts to 1001
 jab 1010 tak badht hoti he, donon NAND get imput HIGH avasthaa main chale jate hai or NAND utpaat LOW sthithi main chali jaati he
 The LOW of the d input can be considered as the CARRY OUT signal when counted up to 10
 ring counter The ring counter is a circular shift resistor that starts when one of its flip-flops is in the HIGH state and the other flip-flops are in the LOW condition
 ring counter ek shift register he jis main pichley flip-flope kaa utpaadan agle flip-flope ke imput se judaa hota he, yani ki chakra rup main
 Typically a pattern consisting of a single bit is distributed so that the condition is repeated n times for every n clock cycle, if n flip-flops are used

 Many new products rely instead on flash memory for the maintenance of data when they are not used, such as pdas or small music players
 Some personal computers, such as many fast computers and netbooks, have also replaced magnetic disks with flash drives
 flash memory ke saath, sidhe code nishpaadan kii anumati pradaan karte hue keval nor prakaar yatharth yadrichhik abhigam main sakasham he or isliye aksar rome ke bajaay iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he; kam laagat vaale nand prakaar kaa prayog aam taur par memory cardon or thos-avasthaa vaale drivon main thok bhandaaran ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Like a microprocessor, a memory chip is an integrated circuit composed of millions of transistors and capacitors)
 computer memory ke sabase saamaanya rup, gatisheel yadrichhik abhigam memory ) main memory cell kaa nirmaan karne ke liye ek transister or ek sandharitra ko joda jaataa he jo keval ek bit data ko darshata he
 The capacitor contains a bit of information - a 0 or a 1
 The transistor acts like a switch that allows the control circuitry of the memory chip to read the capacitor or change its state
 kai computer tantron main ek memory padanukram hota he jisamen sipiu register, on-daai esaram druthika, bahya druthika, diram, prishthan pranali or ek hard drive kii abhaasi memory yaa gamagam sthaan shaamil hote hai
 This overall pool of memory may be referred to by many developers as "RAM", even RAM in different subsystems may have completely different access times, violating the basic concept beyond the random access noun
 ek padanukram str jaise diram ke antargat bhi vishesh pankti, kollam, bank, rank, channel, yaa ghatakon ke antavpatrit sanghathan abhigam samay ko parivartaneey bana dete hai haalanki is had tak nahin ki aavarti bhandaaran madhyam yaa tepe parivartaneey ho jaae

 In many modern personal computers, RAM comes in an intuitively advanced form of modules, called memory modules or dieram modules, and are roughly the same size as pieces of chewing gum

 As suggested above, low-volume RAM) is integrated into hard-drives, cd-roms, and many other parts of the computer system, as well as cpus and other ics on the motherboard
 yadi koi computer teevr anuprayog chakra ke dauraan ram par dhimaa ho jaataa he to kai sipiu architekchar or oparating tantra, ek kaary nishpaadan main sakasham ho jate hai jise "gamagaman" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Swapping uses a paging file that is an area of a hard drive used temporarily as additional working memory
 is kriyavidhi ke nirantar upyog ko thraishing kehete hai or aam taur par yah avaanchhneeya hoti he kyonki yah tantra ke sakal kaary-nishpaadan ko dhimaa kar detii he jiskaa mukhya kaaran yahi he ki ram kii tulana main hard drive adhik dhime hote hai
 Other physical devices that have read-write capability may use "RAM": for example, DVD-RAM
 An indexing method is also named "random access": that's why disk storage is often called "random Access is called " # File and Input / Output, Platform, Standard Edition # Random Access]], indexed file) because the read end can speed up from one part of data to another relatively quickly
 And does not need to read all of the above data
 haalanki, antim "M" mahatvapurn he: "ram" main hota he) hameshaa thos-avasthaa vaale upkaran ko sanderbhit karata he
 RAM is often a shorthand or short text of an online conversation in reference to the computer's main working memory
 software, kisi computer kii ram ke ek hisse kaa "vibhaajan" kar saktaa he or ise ek adhik tej hard drive ke rup main kaary karne kii anumati pradaan karata he jise ram discs kehete hai
 If the memory used is not non-volatile, the data stored in the RAM disk is lost when the computer is turned off
 haalanki, volatile memory apane data ko yathaavat rakh sakati he jab computer band ho jaataa he yadi iske paas ek alag shakti-strot, aam taur par ek bydaree ho
 Sometimes, ROM contents are copied to either ASRAM or DIRAM to achieve a relatively short access time
 The ROM chip is then deactivated when initialized memory locations are changed and installed in the same block of address
 commuter or ambeded pranali donon main is prakriya kaa aam taur par prayog kiya jaataa he jise kabhi-kabhi shadowing bhi kehete hai
 As a general example, typical personal computer bios often have an option called "use shadow bios" or a similar option
 sakriy kiye jane par bios ke rome ke data par aadhaarit prakaarya iske badale diram sthanon kaa upyog karegaa 
 sistar ke aadhaar par iske parinamswaroop kaary-nishpaadan main vruddhi ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi ho sakati he
 In some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because bios are not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access
 beshak, jab shadowing ko sakriy rahata he tab kuch had tak kam mukt memory uplabdh rahati he
 Many new types of non-volatile RAM are under development which will keep the data safe even after the power supply is shut down

 The "memory wall" is the increasing contrast between the CPU and the memory located outside the CPU chip
 is vipareetata kaa ek mukhya kaaran, chip kii simaaon ke baahar kii simit sanchaar bandwidth he
 From the year 1986 to 2000, CPU speed improved at an annual rate of 55% while memory speed improved by only 10%
 in pravritiyon ko dekhte hue yah ummid thi ki memory vilambtaa computer ke kaary-nishpaadan main ek bahut badi rukawat ban jaaegi
 Currently, CPU speed improvements have been greatly reduced, in part due to major physical constraints and in part by the current CPU design already affecting the memory wall in some sense
 intel ne apane platform 2015 pralekhan ) main in kaarnon kaa sankshep main khulaasa kiya he
 "firstly, as the geometry of the chip is reduced and the clock frequencies increase, the leakage of the current transistor is increased resulting in increased power consumption and heat

 The third thing is that traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient for some applications while the processors are speeding up and at the same time reducing the benefits so that frequency increases can be bought in another way 
 Additionally, to some extent due to the limitation in the means of producing the inductance under solid-state devices, resistance latency in signal transmission) is increasing as the feature sizes become smaller which is putting an additional bottleneck
 Which does not indicate an increase in frequency
 " The RC latency in signal transmission has also been recorded at the end of the path of the clock rate versus IPC: traditional microarchitecture, which estimates an average of 12
5% in annual CPU performance improvement between 2000 and 2014

 sabase saral sanrachana kaa paraphin methen he, jo koyale kii khan ke koyala-gas, daldal se nikali gas tathaa malajal ke avamalon se nikle avpank main paaya jaataa he
 Paraffin hydrocarbons are also found in the waxlike elements of some plants
 hydrocarbon main paraphin aise hydrocarbon hai, jinamein hydrogen kii adhiktam maatra rahati he
 These are also called 'combined hydrocarbons'
 vaigyanikon ne inkaa krambaddh naam 'alaken' diya he
 Paraffins form a class of compounds, which are represented by the broad formula, Cn H2n + 2
 isamen na = 1, 2, 3, xxrep 8 
 he
 The carbon atoms of its compounds can be linked in straight lines, or in shaggy chains
 is prakaar ke bandhan se hi aise yogicon main samaavyaktaa hoti he
 Some of the methods of manufacturing paraffin are: 1
 kisi vasiy amla ke sodium lavan ko soda lim ke saath garm karne se paraphin banataa he, jaisaa nimnlikhit sutara se prakat he : rcoona + naoh -> RH + na2co3 2
 kolbe kii vidhi dwaara kisi vasiy amla ke sodium yaa potacium lavan ke vilyan ke jaleey vidyudvishleshan se methen ke atirikt anya sab paraphin ban sakate hai
 3
 By acting with sodium or zinc in dry ether of alkyl halide, alkil hellide ko jasta-tanba yaa aluminium-paara yugmak or athenul ke saath apchayan se tathaa By heating alkyl halide in closed tubes with hydriodic acid and red phosphorus
 4
 sawatya-senderence vidhi dwaramono hydrik alcohalon ko hydrodic amla se apchayan or asantrupt hydrocarbonon ke hydrogenikaran se bhi paraphins praapt hote hai
 5
 Paraffin is also obtained by dissolution of magnesium alkyl halide by water-diluted mineral acids, alcohols and alkyl halides
 paraphin yogicon kii shrenee main yogicon ke anubhaar jyon jyon badhate hai tyon tyon yogicon ke vishisht gurutv, galnaank or kvathanank bhi badhate jate hai
 The first four compounds of paraffins are gases, followed by 11 compound liquids and all the remaining compounds are solids
 paraphins pani main nahin ghulte, kintu hydraxil rahit vilaayakon main ghul jate hai
 Chemically, they are inactive
 kuch hi abhikarmakon, jaise hellojan or oxikaron se ye aakraant hote hai, jinamein se kuch kii abhikriyaayein nimnlikhit hai : From Halogen: CH4 + X2 --> CH3 x + HX Here = fluorine, chlorine is bromine or estetin
 hellojan hydrogen ke ek yaa sabhi parmaanuon ko pratisthapit karata he
 RH + H2SO4 -> RSO3H + HOH nitric amla se : CH4 + HNO4 -> CH4NO4 + HOH salphuril chloride se : C4H10 + SO2 Cl2 -> C4H2SO2 + Cl + hcl paraphinson ke oxikaran se pani or carbondaoxide banate hai or bahut ushma nikalati he
 Paraffin decomposes into two or more substances upon overheating
 unche taap par utprerekon kii upasthiti main, ye samaavyavikaran karte hai
 Paraffin wax is not a fixed compound
 yah paraphin shrenee ke santrupt or asantrupt hydrocarbonon kaa mishran hota he
 Between 21 and 60 carbon atoms have been found in hydrocarbons
 pradhanthya narmal or vivvruth shrinkhalaawaale hydrocarbon rahete hai, par sanvruth shrinkhalaawaale hydrocarbon bilkul apvarjit nahin hai
 Petroleum contains up to three percent wax
 ise paraphin mom kehete hai
 Most of the wax gets into "lubricating oil" when petroleum is distilled
 nirvaat main, athwa bhaap kii upasthiti main, aswan se jo asut praapt hota he usamen mom kii maatra 40 se 50 pratishat tak rah sakati he
 Therefore, such distillate is called wax distillate
 dakshin-purv asia ke tel ke asut main 40 pratishat tak mom paaya gaya he, jabaki europe or america ke kachche tel ke asut main 10 pratishat se adhik mom nahin rahata
 There are two main methods of extracting wax from distillate
 ek reeti main mom asut ko paryaapt thandha karte hai, jisase thos mom drav tel se alag ho jaataa he
 Now filter it in the filter press
 filter press kai prakaar ke tathaa kai patton ke hote hai or vibhinn daab par kaary karte hai
 If the amount of wax in the distillate is small then most of the wax is removed at once, otherwise the process has to be repeated several times
 isse kai shrenee ke mom praapt ho sakate hai
 There is some oil left in such wax cake
 tel kii maatra mom main 0
3 pratishat se adhik nahin rahani chahie
 There are special instruments for extracting oil from raw wax, which are called 'swedek'
 swedak kai prakaar ke bane hai, par un sabhi ke siddhant praaia: ek hi he
 Let the wax melt and frost
 paatr ke pede main tel ikattha hota he or nikaal liya jaataa he
