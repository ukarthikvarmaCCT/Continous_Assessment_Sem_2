 phir yah brahma kii tulana rajas se is prakaar karata he: Then the part of it that is tamas is Rudra, the students of sacred knowledge
 uskaa wo bhaag jo rajas he, he pavitra gyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon, brahma he

 The Bhagavata Purana states that after this he created a variety of dazzling creatures by combining nature and man
 bhagwat puraana maaya ke srijan ko bhi brahma kaa kaam bataata he
 He created it only for creation
 maaya se sab kuch achchhai or buraai, padaarth or aadhyatm, aarambh or ant se rang gaya
 The Puranas describe Brahma as a time-making deity
 ve maanav samay kii brahma ke samay ke saath tulana karte hai
 They say that Mahakalpa is equal to one day and one night of Brahma
 brahma ke bare main vibhinn puraanon kii kathaayen vividh or visangat hai

 This is called regurgitation or leakage
 hriday kii agali dhadkan ke saath yah khun valve se paar hokar saamanyaroop se bahanevaale khun main mil jaataa he
 This extra amount of blood passing through the heart puts an extra burden on the heart muscle
 jab hriday kaa valve puri tarah nahin khulata he, tab hriday ko khun kii saamaanya se adhik maatra pump kerani padati he, taaki sankare raste main paryaapt khun sharir main jaye
 Generally, no symptoms are seen until the path becomes very narrow
 chaati ke eks re or isiji do aisi saamaanya jaanch hai, jinase pataa chalata he ki hriday prabhavit hua he yaa nahin
 Physicians prescribe its treatment based on the patient's general health, medical history, and severity of illness
 chunki rumetic bukhaar hriday rog kaa kaaran he, isliye iskaa sarvottam upachaar rumetic bukhaar ke baar-baar hone se rokna he

 gale ke sankraman ke tatkaal or samuchit upachaar se is rog ko roka ja saktaa he
 If there is rheumatic fever, its repeated invasion can be prevented by continuous antibiotic treatment

 Similarly, the word Kalan is associated with many villages like Kosi Kalan, Bamaniya Kalan
 jis tarah khurd shabd chote yaa laghu kaa paryaay bana usee tarah kalam shabd bade yaa vishaal kaa paryaay bana
 Kalan was used in almost the same sense as the word Greater India was used in ancient times for India which covered the entire territory from Burma to Iran

 The British sent the last Mughal emperor out of the country to Rangoon to eliminate the rebellion for independence
 bahadur shah jafar sirf ek deshbhakt mughal badshaah hi nahin balki urdu ke mashhoor kavi bhi the
 He wrote a number of famous Urdu poems, many of which were lost or destroyed during the upheaval that broke out against the British

 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India

 According to Dr
 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again

 is dosha ke parinamswaroop pyaas or taral padaarth ke seven main ek asaamaanya vruddhi hoti he, jo ADH srav ko ghataati he tathaa mutr utpaadan ko badhaati he
 Desmopressin is ineffective and can result in fluid overload as thirst persists

 While all pregnant women produce vasopressinase in the umbilical cord that causes ADH to disintegrate, it may hold peak forms in GDI

 In some rare cases, although an abnormality in the thirst mechanism, causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used in this case
 bahumootrarog, garbhavastha ke kuch gambhir rogon ke saath bhi judaa hua he
 These are pre-eclampsia HELLP syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy

 In dipsogenic DI, desmopressin is usually not an option
 desmoprasin vrikkajanak DI main aprabhavi hoga
 Instead, diuretic hydrochlorothiazide or indomethacin may improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
 thiajide mutrvardhak ko hypoclemia ko rokane ke liye kabhi-kabhi amiloride ke saath sanyukt kiya jaataa he
 Treating excessive diuresis with diuretics seems contradictory but thiazide diuretics reduce the absorption of sodium and water in the distal convection tube and decrease osmolarity of the fluid in the distal nephron resulting in a decrease in excretion rate
 iske alawa, DI vaale rogiyon ke liye paryaapt jalyojan mahatvapurn he, kyonki ve aasaani se nirjalit ho sakate hai
 Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI can be managed effectively by the use of amiloride, a potassium-free diuretic often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics

 These monopoly profits provide financial incentives for the creation of intellectual property and related research and development expenses

 The legal monopoly conferred by IP laws is credited with significant contribution towards economic development

 This can be compared to rival items, such as clothes, which can only be used by one person at a time
 udhaaharan ke taur par, ganit ke ek farmule ko ek saath kai log prayog kar sakate hai
 Some objections to the term intellectual property are based on the argument that property can only apply to truly rival goods
 chunki ek gair pratidwandvi vastu kaa upyog bahut se log ek hi samay main kar sakate hai isliye utpaadakon ko is prakaar ke kaaryon ko sthapit karne ke liye paise ke alaava protsaahan kii jarurat ho sakati he

 Since the transaction and the relevant benefits and its cost to society will depend on many factors that are specific to each society and product, the optimal time period during which temporary monopoly rights must remain is unclear

 When the administrative secretariats established by the Paris Conference and the Berne Conference were merged in 1893, they too were located in Bern and they also adopted the term intellectual property in their new joint title, the United International Bureau for the Protection of Intellectual Property

 According to Lemley, the term actually began to be used in the United States around this time, and its popular usage began in 1980 after the passage of the beh-dole Act

 Some critics of intellectual property, such as those involved in the free culture movement, designate and argue intellectual monopolies as harmful to health, progress inhibitors, and detrimental to the common people, with the benefit of concentrated interests
 That ever-expanding monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents and business method patents hurt the public interest is

 echivi sankraman ke teen mukhya charan hai: teevr sankraman, naidanik vilambtaa evam aids
 The initial period of HIV that begins after its infection is called acute HIV or primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome
 In many individuals, influenza-like illness or monoucleosis in 2 to 4 weeks
 Symptoms begin to appear and some individuals do not have any such characteristic symptoms
 Symptoms of this disease start appearing in 40% to 90% of cases, with the most prominent symptoms being fever, large tender lymph nodes, swelling of the throat, palpitations, headaches or mouth and genital lesions
 Wheezing is seen in 20% -50% of cases
 In some people, opportunistic infection also develops at this stage
 kuch logon main jathrantra ki bimaariyaan jaise ulti, michali yaa dast or kuch main paridhiy neuropathy ke snaivik lakshan or jullan barre syndrome jaisi bimariyon ke lakshan dikhte hai

 AIDS is defined in two ways, either when the number of CD4 + t cells is less than 200 cells per μl or when a disease is caused in a person's body due to HIV infection
 In the absence of specific treatment, half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years

 Consistent use of condoms during sexual contact reduces the risk of HIV infection by approximately 80%
 When one of the pair's partner is infected with HIV, frequent use of condoms reduces the chance of HIV infection to the uninfected person by less than 1% per year
 There is also evidence of these things that the use of condom by women also provides protection similar to the use of condom for men
 According to a study, using a gel called Tenofovir on the vagina immediately before sex in African women reduced the risk of HIV infection by up to 40%
 Whereas spermicidal nonoxynol 9 in contrast increases the risk of infection because of its own tendency to increase vaginal and anal irritation
 Sunnah in sub-saharan Africa reduces the rate of HIV infection in heterosexual men by 38% –66% of cases by 24 months
 On the basis of these studies, in the year 2007, the World Health Organization and UNAID had described male circumcision as a way to prevent HIV infection from female to male
 Although this can prevent infection from male to female, it is controversial and whether male circumcision will work in developed countries or not and whether it will have any effect in gay men is still undetermined
 Some experts fear that a low perception of insecurity among circumcised men may promote sexual risk, which reduces its preventive effect
 Women who have had their female genitalia cut are at increased risk of developing HIV
 Programs showing sexual abstinence also do not appear to affect the increasing risk of HIV
 Massive sex education in school can reduce its prevalence

 However, after his first match, Warrior claimed mcmahon asked him to do a pre-taped promo
 Vince said that we like your warrior but we don't want a dingo
 The warrior then cuts the promo, stating that they are not this warrior or that warrior, they are the ultimate warrior

 The next chapter of Warrier's career was to collide with The Undertaker after the Undertaker and his manager Paul Bearer were locked in a coffin on the set of Bearer's Funeral Parlor
 dablyoodablyooef adhikariyon ne uttejnapurvak taabut ko kholaa, antat wariar ke bejaan sharir ko baahar nikaala or taabut ke andar fate hue kapadon se wariar ke baahar aane kii chatapataahat ko darshaya gaya
 Warrior was eventually revived by officers with CPR, giving Jake "the Snack" Roberts the Warrior a "feeling of darkness" in order to prepare him for revenge from The Undertaker
 isamen robrts kaa warrier ko teen "pareekshan" dena shaamil he jise lagaataar hafton main dablyoodablyooef tivi par dikhaaya gaya

 roberts ne kaha ki, "kabhi bhi ek saanp par vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie
" or manch ko ab ultimate warrier or roberts ke bich ek match ke liye nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 However, the match could never be held

 The WWF alleged that Warrier threatened to not do any shows until his former performance at wrestlemania was paid to him
 vins macmohan ke anusaar, warrier ko bhugtan kiya gaya or summerslam se turant baad hi nikaal diya gaya
 mcmahon set a precedent for other wrestlers by removing the warrior from the WWF
 1992 ke madhya main dablyoodablyooef se hogan ke chhod kar jane se thik pehle macmohan ne warrier se waapas aane ke liye sampark kiya
 He made a comeback at wrestlemania VIII when he made his comeback when he appeared quite young and cut his hair short, leading to a rumor that it was someone else who was playing the role of warrior
 lautne par unhone apni booking par rachanaatmak niyantran praapt kiya
 One story involved Papa Shengo and a "witch doctor" playing a spell on the warrior that would make him shiver and vomit in a strange color, though Warrier said he hated the story and that it They have no control
 warrier ko us samay ke champion "mecho main" rendi sevej ke khilaaf agast 1992 main summerslam par ek dablyoodablyooef championships ke liye arakshit kiya gaya tha

 november, 1992 main, warrier ko saathi ke rup main sevej ke saath ek tag team banani thi jise cerviver siries main ultimate meniex ke rup main janaa gaya
 However, weeks before the event, the Warrior and WWF were once again embroiled in mutual disputes, raising questions as to who had the creative rights in the name of the Ultimate Warrior and how the character of the Warrior should be used
 dablyoodablyooef ne kaha ki wariar ke jane kaa kaaran "niyam ulanghan" tha jise ek yadrichhik dawa pareekshan ke dauraan apane system main paaya gaya tha
 The dispute was largely due to Warrier's ongoing marketing / financial differences with Vince mcmahon
 titan sports or dablyoodablyooef steroid ke istemaal ke saath pradarshan ko lekar apni dawa nitiyon ke gahan jaanch ke adheen thi
 Warrier claimed that his test results showed that he did not use steroids during this period
 warrier ne kaha ki macmohan ke steroid mukademe ke dauraan uskaa or saathi pahalwaan, "da british bulldog" davy boy smith kaa istemaal ek bali ke bakre ke rup main kiya gaya

 parantu unke ram se sambaddh hone kaa koi sanket nahin mil paata he
 The word 'rama' is used in Brahmin literature at two sites in Aitareya Brahmana; But there he is called 'ramo Margaveyaah', which according to Acharya Sayan is the son of a woman named 'mrigavu'
 shatapath brahman main ek sthal par 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 Here 'rama' is as the Acharya of Yajna and he is called 'rama Aupatapasvini'
 taatpary yah ki prachlit ram kaa avtari rup valmikiy ramayana evam puraanon kii hi dein he
 The following description is available in relation to the birth of Rama in the most authentic scripture Adikavya Valmiki Ramayana related to Ramakatha: xxrep 22 
 chaitre navamike tithu
 
 nakshatreditidaivatye swocchsanstheshu panchasu
 Bhreeshu karkte lagne vakpavatinduna co
 
 That is, in the Navami Tithi of Chaitra month, in Punarvasu Nakshatra, when the five planets are in their high position and the position of Jupiter with the Moon in Cancer Ascendant
 yahan keval brihaspati tathaa chandramaa kii sthiti spasht hoti he
 Jupiter is exalted and the moon is self-possessed
 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened

 With the state rules, only the eldest son of a king is eligible to become a king, so Rama was sure to become the king of Ayodhya
 kaikeyi jinhone do baar dasharath kii jaan bachaai thi or dasharath ne unhen yah var diya tha ki wo jivan ke kisi bhi pal unase do var maang sakati he
 Kaikeyi wanted Rama to be king as Raja becoming king and looking to the future, so he granted Rama 14 years of exile by King Dasharatha and demanded the kingdom of Ayodhya for his son Bharata

 He made a golden deer form at the behest of Ravana
 sita use dekh kar mohit ho gai or shriram se us hiran kaa shikaar karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Shri Ram started to fulfill his Indian desire and asked Lakshmana to protect Sita

 This epic is a mixture of art and science, being a mixture of two great traditions of Sanskrit literature - Ramayana and Paninian grammar
 at: ise sahitya main ek nayaa or sahaspurn prayog mana jaataa he
 While expressing pride of his own work, Bhatti has said that this composition is not for the readers inferior to the knowledge of grammar

 It is designed to entertain the meritorious scholar, and to make the Subodh student aware of the rigorous rules of grammar in practical method

 In the tradition of ancient reading, Bhattikavya is given the same place as the famous Panchamahakaavya

 In Madhyaviyathatuvrati, there is a mention of the commentary on Bhattikavya by Adi Shankara
 is mahakavy kaa upjivy granth valmikikrut ramayana he
 There are four episodes in the epic
 kathabhag ke upkathan kii drushti se yah mahakavy 22 sargo main vibhajit he tathaa mahakavy ke sakal lakshanon se samanvit he
 The main purpose of the composition is to present the characteristics of grammar and literature by the target
 lakshya dwaara lakshanon ko upasthit karne kii drushti se yah mahakavy chaar candon main vibhajit he jisamen teen cond sanskrit vyakaran ke anusaar vividh shabdarupon ko prayukt kar rachayita kii uddeshysiddhi karte hai
 a scandal in the middle is characterized by certain organs of poetry
 rachana kaa anukram is prakaar he ki pratham cond vyakarnanusaari vividh shabdarupon ko prakeern rup se sangruhit karata he
 The second scandal is the 'rights scandal', in which word usage is in accordance with the rules displayed in certain specific rights of Paninian grammar
 tritiy cond saahitiyik visheshtaon ko abhilakshith karne kii drushti se rachaa gaya he atev is cond ko mahakavi ne 'prasancand' kii sangya di he
 There are four tribunals in this scandal: The first tribunal has the goals of linguistic and semantic
 dwitiya adhikaran main maadhurya gun ke swaroop kaa pradarshan lakshya dwaara kiya gaya he, tritiy adhikaran main bhaviktv kaa swaroop pradarshan karte hue kathanak ke prasanganusaar raajnneeti ke vividh tatwon evam upayon par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The fourth tribunal of the Prasanna Kand is a special form of this epic
 isamen aise padyon kii rachana kii gai he jinamein sanskrit tathaa praakrit bhashaa kaa samanaantar samavesh he, vahi padya sanskrit main upanibaddh he jisaki padaavalee praakrit padya kaa bhi yathavat swaroop liye he or donon bhashaa main pratipaadya arth ek hi he
 This part is a personal feature of Bhattikavya, presenting an example of language language
 antim cond pun: sanskrit vyakaran ke ek jatil swaroop tisaint ke vividh shabdarup ko pradarshit karata he
 This scandal is the biggest
 lakshanatmak in chaar candon main kathavstu ke vibhaajan kii drushti se pratham cond main pehle paanch sarg hai jinamein kramash: ramajanm, sitavivaah, ram kaa vanagaman evam sitaaharan tathaa ram ke dwaara seetanveshan kaa upkram varnit he
 The second episode covers the next four sergoes, describing the coronation of Sugriva's coronation, the discovery of Sita by the monkey Bhatas, the dissolution of the Ashokavatika on his return, and the capture of Maruti and present in the assembly
 tisare, prasancand main agle chaar sarg hai jinamein sita ke abhigyaan kaa pradarshan, lanka main prabhaat kaa varnan, vibhishana kaa ram ke paas aagaman tathaa sethubandh kii katha he
 The last, the third incident takes the next nine cantos, in which the story is told till the return of King Ramachandra to Ayodhya by attaching the sherbandha
 chaaron cond or 22 sargo main 1625 padya hai, jinamein pratham padya mangalacharan vastunirdeshaatmak he tathaa antim padya kavyopsanhaar kaa he
 Most of the experiments in this epic of 1625 verse are of the Anubhuta shlokas, in which the cantos are six, nine and 14th and 12th
 dasven sarg main vividh chhandon kaa prayog kiya gaya he jinamein puppitagra pramukh he
 Apart from these, there is a small use of Prahrishini, Malini, Aupachandasik, Dynastha, Vitaliya, Ashwalalit, Nandan, Prithvi, Ruchira, Narkutak, Tanumadhya, Trotak, Dritavilibad, Pramitakshara, Prahranakalika, Mandakranta, Shardulwikrit and Srabdhara

 According to the prophet himself, Bhattikavya was composed in Balabhi Nagar under the Gurjar country
 bhatti kavi kaa naam "bhartri" shabd kaa apbhransh rup he
 Certain reviewers consider the poet's full name as Bhartrihari, but this Bhartrihari is certainly different from Bhatruhari, the creator of the Shatatraya or the principal of the syntactic
 bhatti upnaam bhartruhari kavi valbhinaresh shridhar sen se sambandhit he
 The time of Mahakavi Bhatti is unanimous in the late sixth century AD
 alankaar varg main nidarshit udaahranon se spasht prathit hota he ki bhatti or bhamah ek hi parampara ke anuyaayi hai
 For nearly 10 centuries before Bhattikavya's composition, Panini's Ashtadhyayi's deep reading was going on
 bhatti kaa uddeshy ashtaadhi ke adhyayan ko aasaan banane vaala saadhan nirmit karnaa tha
 He did this by associating the examples given in the grammar texts already existing with the Ramakatha
 isse seekhney main saralata or sarasata aa gai
 The influence of Bhattikavya can be seen even in remote Java
 vahaan kaa pracheen java bhashaa kaa ramayana bhattikavy par hi aadhaarit he
 This Ramayana is currently the oldest surviving text of the Java language
 yah ramayana bhattikavy ko 12wein sarg tak purnatah anusaran karata he
 Sometimes the entire poem has been translated
 12wein sarg ke baad java bhashaa kaa ramayana bhattikavy se alag hota dikhataa he
