 saanchaa:andhra pradesh ke vishvavidhyalay Legal positivism is an ideology related to philosophy of law and jurisprudence
 iskaa vikaas adhikanshtah attharahavin evam unnisvin shatabdi ke vidhi-chintakon dwaara hua jinamein jeremi bentham tathaa jon austin kaa naam pramukh he
 But the most notable name in the history of legal positivism is that of HLA Hart, whose book titled 'the Concept of Law' forced a deeper consideration of the subject
 haal ke varshon main ronaald dorkin ne vidhik pratyakshvaad ke kuch kendriya vichaaron par gambheer sawaal uthaaye hai
 Legal positivism is difficult to summarize, but it is often believed that the central idea of legal positivism is: vishleshnatmak chintan kaa prarambh mukhyatah bentham dwaara atharahavin shatabdi ke ant main kiya gaya jiskaa vikaas aage chalakar austin ke haathon hua
 It is also called theistic ideology
 samand ise vyavasthit vidhishastra tathaa si0ke0 alan aadeshaatmak siddhanth kehete hai
 The biggest feature of this ideology is that just as physics progresses on the strength of analysis, in the same way it does not accept anything without analysis
 prakritik vichaardhaara kii tarah yah vidhi ko divine yaa daiv jaat yaa praapt nahin maanati, balki iskaa udbhav samprabhu rajya se hua maanati he
 This ideology analyzes legal rules
 isliye yah aitihaasik yaa samajashastreey vichaardhaara se bhinn ho jaati he
 This ideology wants to study the mutual relations of civil law and other methods in an analytical manner and considers the method not to be achieved but created
 vidhi kii aitihaasik pragati kaa mul kya he, isse is vichaardhaara kaa koi matlab nahin
 Julius Stone has rightly said, "its main interest is to analyze legal meanings and to investigate the logical interrelations of legal reasoning sentences
" samand ne is vichaardhaara ke prayojan ko in shabdon main vyakt kiya he- According to Munro Smith, this ideology is considered necessary for the state's conscious seal method
 is arth main vidhi sachetan or nishchit maanav ichha kii abhivyakti he
 Authenticism provides a scientific approach that allows the data presented to be confined to the experience by rejecting hypotheses beyond experience
 yah drushtikon die hue tathyon ke vishleshan tak simit rahata he tathaa anubhuti kii parighatnaon se dur nahin jaataa he
 Staying away from the hypotheses of the past and the future, it has been named as the authentic approach due to the factual study of 'method as it is'
 england main mukhya rup se prachlit hone tathaa austin se jude hone ke naate ise english yaa astinian skool bhi kehete hai
 It is also called obedient theory because of the compulsion of law to be considered as the command of Samprabhu
 heart ise ‘‘samadesh, anushaasti evam samprabhu kii triveni’’ maanate hai
 In this ideology, special emphasis is laid on the constructive elements of law by man
 atharahavin shatabdi ke ant tathaa unnisvin shatabdi ke prarambh hote-hote is vichaardhaara kaa janm nimnlikhit kaarnon se hua
 1
 The eighteenth century belonged to the natural law thinkers in which the principles of policy, prudence and justice dominated legal philosophy
 yah ‘vidhi jaisi honi chahie’ kaa yug tha
 But it did not remain consistent for a long time
 bentham ne swayan ko is prakaar kii vichaardhaara se alag kar liya tathaa vyaakhyaatmak vidhishastra arthath ‘vidhi jo he’ par bal diya
 This implies that analytical ideology was born as opposed to natural law ideology
 2
 unnisvin shatabdi ke prarambh main bhautik vigyaan main hui pragati kaa prabhaav nishchit rup se vidhik vigyaan ke siddhanton par bhi padaa
 Methods of evidence, reasoning, examination and analysis of given facts were adopted for the study of method
 vidhi ke adhyayan ke liye vaigyanik, krambaddh anubhavjanya yaa anubhav saapeksh paddati apanaayi gayi
 3
 It seems that by analyzing ideology the sovereignty ruler was proved superior in England over the feudal and the pope etc
 is vichaardhaara ke saath hi vidhi ke kshetra main aadhyatmik dakhlandaji kam ho gai
 Legal legalism has also been called the prescriptive principle of law as state sovereign and law as command of sovereign and due to interpretation of the element of discipline in compliance with law
 vidhik pramanwad kaa prayog vibhinn arthon main kiya gaya he
 The modern analytic theorist thinker Prof
 HLA Hart himself has accepted its use in five meanings
 heart ne in paanch arthon main kiye gayi prayog kii vaastavik prishthbhumi main vyakhya karte hue yah spasht kiya he ki bentham or austin se lekar tak die gayi siddhanton ko maanate hai parantu or vaale siddhanton ko nahin
 Similarly, Kelsen has accepted the principles expressed in and, but not the principles given in and
 heart ke anusaar main varnit siddhanth ko bentham, austin or kelson main se kisi ne nahin mana he
 Yet this theory is often associated with analytical jurisprudents without obvious reasons
 yogavasishth sanskrit sahitya main advait veydant kaa ati mahatvapurn granth he
 In this, sage Vasistha gives knowledge of Nirguna Brahma to Lord Rama
 adikavi valmiki paramparanusaar yogavasishth ke rachayita maane jate hai
 This is the second largest Sanskrit text after the Mahabharata
 yah yoga kaa bhi mahatvapurn granth he
 It is also known by the names 'maharamayana', 'yogavashistha-ramayana', 'aarsha Ramayana', 'vasistha-ramayana' and 'jnanavasistha'
 yogavasishth main jagat kii asatta or parmatmasatta kaa vibhinn drushtaanton ke madhyam se pratipaadan he
 The name of the third case of Yogavashistha is the genesis case, the name of the fourth is the case case and the name of the fifth is the Upasham case
 is aadhaar par prathit hota he ki yah prakaran onkaar ke a, u tathaa m aksharon kii vyakhya hai
 Scholars believe that happiness and sorrow, just and death, life and the world, root and consciousness, world and otherworlds, bondage and salvation, Brahman and jiva, soul and divine, self and knowledge, satta and asat, mind and senses, perception And there is hardly any treatise on subjects like lust, in which more serious thinking and subtle analysis has taken place than in 'yoga Vasistha'
 anek rishi-muniyon ke anubhavon ke saath saath anginat manohari kathaon ke sangyojan se is granth kaa mahatva or bhi bad jaataa he
 Self illumination is the only way to salvation
 aatmanusndhan main lage anek santon tathaa mahapurushon ke kriyakalapon kaa vilakshan varnan is granth main diya gaya hai
 In Yogvasistha, there is the rendering of Jag's untruth and Paramatmatta through various parables
 purusharth evam tatva-gyaan ke nirupan ke saath-saath isamen shastrokt sadachaar, tyaag-vairagyayukt satkarm or adarsh vyavhaar aadi par bhi sookshm vivechan he
 Due to the instructions of the Buddhists in the scientific, nihilistic, secondary, etc
 and philosophy of Kashmiri Shaiva, Trika, Pratibhyana and Spanda etc
, its authors are considered other poets of the same name
 atah is granth ke vaastavik rachiyata ke sambandh main matbhed he
 This book is also famous by the name of Aarsharamayana, Maharamayana, Vasistharamayan, Gyanvasistha and only Vasistha
 yogavasishth kii shloke sankhya 32 hajaar he
 According to the opinion of scholars, like Mahabharata, it also developed in three stages- yogavasishth granth chah prakarnon main purna he
 The total number of shlokas in it is 27687
 valmiki ramayana se lagbhag chaar hajaar adhik shloke hone ke kaaran iskaa 'maharamayana' abhidhaan sarvatha sarthak he
 It contains spiritual teachings given by Maharishi Vasistha, not a biography of Ramchandraji
 pratham vairaygy prakaran main upanayan sanskaar ke baad prabhu ramachandra apane bhaaiyon ke saath gurukul main adhyayanarth gaye
 Ramachandraji was disgusted on his return from pilgrimage after the completion of studies
 maharaj dasharath kii sabha main ve kehete hai ki vaibhav, rajya, deh or aakanksha kaa kya upyog he
 Kaal is going to destroy them all in a few days
 apni manovyatha kaa nivaaran karne kii prarthana unhone apane guru vasishtha or vishwamitra se kii
 According to the information of Vishwamitra in the second Mummukhusabhana case, Vashistha Rishi has preached
 3-4 or 5 wein prakarnon main sansar kii utpatti, sthiti or lay kii utpatti vaarnit he
 Many visual narratives and anecdotes have been requested in these works

 At the heart of this method are psychological assessment and psychotherapy; Although clinical psychologists are also involved in research, teaching, counseling, forensic evidence and program development and administration
 kai deshon main naidanik manovigyaan ek niyantrit maansik swasthya pesha he
 The beginning of this area is often attributed to the establishment of the first psychiatric hospital in 1896 by Lightner Wittmer at the University of Pennsylvania

 1940 ke dashak ke baad, jab dwitiya vishwa yuddh main prashikshit chikitsakon kii badi sankhya main aavashyaktaa hui, tab isamen badlaav aayaa
 Since then, two major academic formats have developed - phd science-doctor format and psychologist-doctor-scholar format
 Clinical psychologists are now considered experts in psychiatry, and are generally trained in four major primary theoretical orientations - psychodynamics, humanities, behavioral therapy / cognitive behavioral and systems or family therapies

 The earliest recorded methods included a combination of religious, miraculous, and / or medical perspectives
 Early examples of such physicians include Patanjali, Padmasambhava, Rages, Avicenna, and Rumi

 Other popular treatments included facial science - the study of facial shapes - and hypnosis, the Mesmer treatment with the help of magnets
 aadhyatmavaad tathaa finis kimbi kaa “maansik aarogy” bhi lokapriy tha
 While the scientific communities eventually rejected all these methods, the academic psychologist was also not worried about serious mental illnesses

 Although sporadically a practical psychology was being voiced, the general field disagreed with this idea and considered only "pure" science as a prestigious practice
 However, this changed when Lightner Wittmer, an alumnus of Wund and chairman of the Department of Psychology of the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy with a spelling problem

 Even though the use of clinical psychology was increasing, diseases with severe mental stress remained under psychiatry and neurology
 However, clinical psychologists continued to work in this field due to the increasing ability of their psychological assessment
 Psychologists' reputation as an assessment specialist grew during World War I, when two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta, were developed that could be used on large numbers of recruits
 Due to the huge success of these tests, assessment remained the major topic of clinical psychology for the next quarter century, until the Second World War, leading the field to treatment
 varsh 1917 main ‘american association of clinical psychology’ kii sthapana ke baad se is kshetra ne “clinical psychology ” naam ke tahat sangathit hona shuru kiya
 It only lasted until 1919, after which the 'american Psychological Association' developed a part of clinical psychology, which provided certification by the year 1927
 agle kuch varshon tak, varsh 1930 main vibhinn asambaddha manovaigyanik sanghathanon ke ‘american association of applid psychology’ ke rup main ekatra hone tak, jo dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaal main APA ke punargathan tak manovaigyanikon ke liye ek pramukh manch rahaa, is kshetra main dhimaa vikaas hua
 In the year 1945, APA created an organization currently known as 'division 12', which was the main organization of the region
 Psychological societies and organizations in other English-speaking countries developed similar departments, including countries such as Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand

 At the same time, female psychologists jointly formed the 'national Council of Women Psychologists', which aimed to help communities overcome the stress of war and to provide counseling to young mothers on child care
 After the war, America's Veterans Administration invested heavily in programs that trained medical-level psychologists to help with the necessary treatment of thousands of retired soldiers

 Medical-work-based degrees were discussed in 1965, and at least in 1968 Ilienis University received approval for an initial program
 a number of such programs were established thereafter, and in the year 1973, in the Well Conference of Professional Programs in Psychology, the doctor-scholar format of Clinical Psychology - or Doctor's Degree in Psychology in the Well Model was recognized

 The aim of many cognitive behavioral treatments is to discover and identify prejudicially impractical methods of being associated or expressed and to help the patient recover from these methods by various system sciences to help him live a more happy life
 Many types of techniques are used for this, such as systematic disengagement, Socratic questions and the use of cognitive observation logs

 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 They are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way
 ye itane samarth hote hai ki anya bhaavon ko apane main villin kar lete hai
 Their number is 11 - Rati, Haas, mourning, ecstasy, anger, fear, jugupsa, amazement, Nirveda, Vatsalata and love for God
 vibhaav kaa arth he kaaran
 They affect / express the permanent expressions, making them tasty
 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai

 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he

 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and take the support of the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse
 And do
 sanyog kii anek paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par use aganeya maanakar use keval aashray bhed se nayakaarabdh, nayikaarabdh athwa ubhayaarabdh, prakaashan ke vichaar se prachhann tathaa prakaash yaa spasht or gupt tathaa prakashanprakaar ke vichaar se sankshipt, sankeern, sampannatar tathaa samrudhimaan naamak bhed kiye jate hai tathaa vipralambh ke purvanurag yaa abhilashahetuk, maan yaa ishryahetuk, pravaas, virah tathaa karun prilambh naamak bhed kiye gaye hai
 The antithesis of "poetry poetry" is new and the shapahutak distinction can only be accepted as a form of migration, "sahityadarpan" envisages the Karuna Vipralambha
 purvanurag kaaran kii drushti se gunshravan, pratyakshdarshan, chitradarshan, swapn tathaa indrajaal-darshan-janya evam raag sthirataa or chamak ke aadhaar par neeli, kusumbh tathaa manjistha naamak bhedon main baanta jaataa he
 In "alankarakoustubh", the soon-to-be-destroyed and not-so-beautiful raga is called the fourth by the name "haridra", which his commentator also calls "shyamarag"
 purvanurag kaa dash kaamadshaayen - abhilash, chintaa, anusmriti, gunakirthan, udvaig, vilaap, vyaadhi, jadta tathaa maran - maani gai hai, jinke sthaan par kahin apane tathaa kahin duusare ke mat ke rup main vishnudharmotarpurana, dasharupak kii avlok tikaa, sahityadarpan, prataparudriya tathaa saraswatikanthabharan tathaa kavyadarpan main kinchit parivartan ke saath chakshupriti, man:sang, samaran, nidrabhang, tanuta, vyavriti, lajjanaash, unmaad, muchrcha tathaa maran kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 By adding Sharadatanaya, desire and yearning, and Vidyanatha, his number is considered 12 by bringing resolution in place of remembrance and increasing delirium and beauty
 yah yuktiyukt nahin he or inkaa antarbhaav ho saktaa he
 There are two types in the name of mana-vipralambha pranay and jealousy and three types in the name of small, medium and guru, in consideration of stability of mana and severity of crime, three types in the name of vivaripalambha karyaja, shapaj, sambhramaja and the popularization of work or The future Gachpatravas or present and Gatpravas or the future Gachpatravas or the present and the Gatpravas or the Gharpravas, the tadrupas and forms of Shapaj, and a variety of reasons Nbramj of violence, weather, divine, man, and Prckradi distinction is
 virah gurujanadi kii sameeptha ke kaaran paas rahakar bhi nayika tathaa nayak ke sanyog ke hone kaa tathaa karun vipralambh mrityu ke ananthar bhi punerjeevan dwaara milan kii aashaa bani rahanevaale viyog ko kehete hai
 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa
 ek udhaaharan he- Similarly, the example of Shringar Rasa divided into two parts by the name of Sanyog and Vipralambha or Vioga- hasyaras ke vibhavbhed se aatmasth tathaa parastha evam hasya ke vikasvichaar se smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, apasit tathaa atihasit bhed karke unke bhi uttam, madhyam tathaa adham prakruti bhed se teen bhed karte hue unke antargat purvokt kramash: do-do bhedon ko rakhaa gaya he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet
 keval rudrabhatt ne avashya vairaygy, doshanigrah, santosh tathaa tatvasaakshaatkaar naam se iske chaar bhed die hai jo saadhan maatr ke naam he or inaki sankhya badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance
 saath hi nirved, glani, chintaa, autsukya, aaveg, moh, shram, bhay, vishaad, dainya, vyaadhi, jadta, unmaad, apsmaar, traas, aalasy, maran, stambh, vepathu, vevarnya, ashru, swarbhed aadi kii vyabhichaari yaa sanchari bhav ke rup main pariganit kiya he
 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa
 sanskrit ke granthon main ‘mahabharat’ tathaa ‘vircharit’, ‘venisanhaar’ ityadi naatakon main raudra ras kii prabhoot abhivyakti hui he
 Examples - shringaar, raudra tathaa vibhats ke saath viraras ko bhi bharat muni ne mul rason main pariganit kiya he
 The origin of the amazing juice has been revealed from Veer Ras
 vir ras kaa 'varna' 'swarna' athwa 'gaur' tathaa devtaa indra kahe gayi hai
 It is associated with good nature and its abiding spirit is 'enthusiasm'
 vir ras ke keval yudhvir, dharmaveer, dayavir tathaa daanveer bhed sweekaar kiye jate hai
 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj
 vaishnav acharya iske drusht, shrut, sankirtit tathaa anumit naamak bhed karte hai
 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 According to Jain philosophy, Asravas are an element of the world or a fundamental reality

 The main components of cement are Tri calcium silicate, Die calcium silicate and Tri calcium aluminate, in addition to addition of about 3% gypsum before grinding it increases cement fineness
 isse cement ke jamane ke samay par niyantran rakhaa ja saktaa he
 By adding water to the cement, the cement hardens and hardens
 iskaa kaaran uske uparyukt ghatakon kaa jalyojan or jal apghaton he
 The initial coagulation is due to aluminate and subsequent initial strengthening is mainly due to tri silicate
 dicilicket kii kriya sabase mand hoti he
 It takes 14 to 28 days or more to strengthen it
 === jald kathor hone vaala cement ===fast setting cementbadza jald majboot ho jaataa he yadhyapi iskaa praarambhik or antim jamaav kaa samay saamaanya cement se kuch adhik hota he
 It contains more tri-calcium silicate and is more finely brewed
 ooshmaa kaa utpaadan tathaa jamane or kathorikaran ke samay main adhik sankuchan ke kaaran iskaa upyog bade paimaane par concrit main nahin hota he
 Tri calcium aluminate is the major cause of heat development
 at: cement main isaki maatra nunatam, keval 5% hi, rakhi jaati he
 This type of cement is less strong in the initial stages
 par isaki antim majbootee main koi antar nahin hota he
 It is used to quickly get stronger and firm against chemical effects, such as flowing water or seawater
 iskaa bade paimaane par nirmaan alumini tathaa calciumi padaarthon ke upyukt anupaat main mishran ko galane tathaa baad main utpaadash ko maheen piskar kiya jaataa he
 Such cement spreads during deposition

 The gray color of cement is due to iron oxide in a non-polluting form
 yadi portland cement main irun oxide ne ho to cement kaa rang safed hoga
 The cost of extracting iron oxide, which is usually a part of natural substances, increases the price of white cement
 safed cement ko piste samay lagbhag das pratishat varnak mila dene se rangeen cement taiyaar hota he
 The whole and red color can be successfully applied in gray cement

 'prithviraj vijay' ke anusaar usne gazani kii sena ko bhi parrast kiya
 Ajayraj established a city named Ajmer in 1113 AD to protect his kingdom and built a fort called Taragarh
 ajayraj ne ajmer ko chouhan samrajya kii rajdhani banaaya
 He issued coins named Ajayapradramas
 uske rajya kaal me dharm, sahishnutaa ore vidya kii pragati se us samay ke saanskrithik mahatv kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Ajayraj is not particularly famous for the expansion of the state, but his fame is due to the creation of Ajmer

 Gravity is the tendency of a material to be attracted towards one another
 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 German astronomer Kepler gave three laws by studying the motion of planets
 kepler kaa pratham niyam: -sabhi grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar kakshaon me chakkar lagate hai tathaa surya un kakshaon ke focus par hota he
 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time
 arthath prayek grah kii kshetreey chaal niyat rahati he
 That is, when the planet is away from the Sun, its speed decreases
 tritiy niyam : - prayek grah kaa surya kaa parikraman kaal kaa varg uski deergh vrittakar kaksha kii ardh-deergh aksh kii tritiy ghaat ke samaanupati hota he
 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground
 par jab akaash main samaan takat chaaron ore se lage, to koi kaise gire? arthath akaash main grah niravlamb rahete hai kyonki vividh grahon kii gurutv shaktiyaan santulan banaae rakhti hai
