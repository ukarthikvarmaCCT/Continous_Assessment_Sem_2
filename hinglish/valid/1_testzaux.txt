 Esters of this acid cannot be made by ordinary methods
 iske liye alkil hellide yaa sulphate par sodium yaa potacium cynide kii kriya kerani padati he: In addition, alkyl cyanide can also be formed by dehydration of amides of acids, which makes it clear that these compounds are not common cyanide moles, and are also called nitriles of those acids, because their acidification gives them acid
 : prusik amla eldihidon yaa kitonon se kriya karke yogashil padaarth banaate hai or in yogicon kaa hydroxi amlon ke sanshleshan main vishesh mahatv he

 Many Sunnis do not consider Shias completely muslims
every Muslim has 5 essential duties in sunni islam main har musalmaan ke 5 aavashyak kartavya hote hai jinhen islam ke 5 stambh bhi kaha jaataa he
 Slightly different doctrines are called stanzas in Shia Islam
 sunni islam ke 5 stambh hai- Arabic: لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله Transliteration: La ilaha ilallah Muhammad Rasool Allah Hindi: There is no other God but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
 is ghoshnaa se har musalmaan ishwar kii akeshwarvadita or mohammad ke rasul hone ke apane vishwaas kii gavaahi detaa he

 Muhammad the Prophet attained the ultimate knowledge in the hills of Mecca around 610
 jab unhone upadesh dena aarambh kiya tab makka ke samrudh logon ne ise apni saamaajik or dharmik vyavastha par khatra samajha or unka virodh kiya
 Finally in 622 he had to travel from Mecca to Medina with his followers
 is yatra ko hijra kaha jaataa he or yaheen se islamic calendar kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The lives of the people of Madina were troubled by mutual fighting and the messages of Hazrat Muhammad Sahab made them very popular there
 630 main hazrat mohammad sahab ne apane anuyaayiyon ke saath ek sandhi kaa ulanghan hone ke kaaran makka par chadhaai kar di
 The Meccans surrendered and converted to Islam
 makka main sthit kaaba ko islam kaa pavitra sthal ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Prophet Muhammad saheb died in 632
 par unki mrityu tak islam ke prabhaav se arab ke saare kabeeley ek raajnneetik or saamaajik sabhyataa kaa hissaa ban gayi the
 After this, the Khilafat phase began in Islam
 mohammad ke sasur abu bakr siddiq musalamaanon ke pehle khalipha 632 main banaaye gayi
 Many prominent Muslims accepted the mill to be their caliph
 sunni musalamaanon ke anusaar abu bakr siddiq kii khilaafat ke sambandh main koi vivaad nahin hua apitu sabhi ne unhe khalifaa swikaar kar liya tha, sunni manytaaon ke anusaar hazrat mohammad sahab ne swayan apane swargvaas se purv hi abu bakr siddiq ko apane sthaan par imamat karne kaa kaary bhaar dekar abu bakr siddiq ke khalifaa hone kaa kaa sanket de diya tha san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko hazrat ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 Keep in mind that Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan, that is, Bani Hashim Ali, wanted to be Khalifa
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 parantu shiya muslim ke anusaar mohammad ke chachaa jaad bhai, ali, jin kaa musalmaan bahut aadar karte the ne abu bakr ko khalipha maanane se inkaar kar diya
 But this controversy was averted in order to prevent the destruction of Islam, in fact, because of the wisdom of Hazrat Ali, the fighting of Muslim forces from the Eastern Roman Empire and the Iranian Empire took place during Abu Bakr's tenure
 yah yuddh mohammad ke jamaane se chali aa rahi dushmani kaa hissaa the
 Umar bin Khatab was made caliph in 634 after Abu Bakr
 unke kaarykaal main islamic samrajya bahut tezi se failaa or sampurna irani samrajya or do tihaai purvi roman samrajya par musalamaanon ne kabaja kar liya
 The entire empire was divided into various territories and a governor was appointed for each region which was under the Caliphate
 umr bin khattab ke baad usmaan bin afphan 644 main khalipha bane
 These were also among the prominent companions of Muhammad
 usmaan bin afphan par unke virodhiyon ne ye aarope lagane shuru kiye ki wo pakshpaat se niyuktiyaan karte hai or ki ali hi khalipha hone ke sahi hakdaar hai
 Then the spirit of rebellion arose in Egypt and from there an armed group of 1000 people came to Madina, the capital of Islamic Empire
 us samay tak sabhi khalipha aam logon kii tarah hi rahete the
 Therefore, this group succeeded in killing Usman in 656
 kuch pramukh musalamaanon ne ab ali ko khalipha sweenkar kar liya lekin kuch pramukh musalamaanon kaa dal ali ke khilaaf bhi ho gaya
 These Muslims believed that it was not right for Ali to become the Khalifa until the killers of Usman were punished
 yah islam kaa pehla grihayuddh tha
 Initially, a part of this group was led by Ayesha, Muhammad's wife
 ali or ashya kii senaaon ke bich main jang hooi jise jang-e-jamal kehete hai
 Ali's army conquered in this battle
 ab syria ke rajyapal muavia ne vidroh kaa bigul bajaayaa
 Mu'awiya was also a relative of Usman, there was no result of war between Mu'awiya's army and Ali's army
 ali ne samrajya main faili ashaanti par kaabo paane ke liye rajdhani madina se kufa main pehle hi badal di thi
 Mu'awiya's armies now spread throughout the Islamic Empire, and soon Mu'awiya was captured by the entire empire except the territory of Kufa
 tabhi ek kattarpanthi ne 661 main ali kii hatya kar di
 After Ali, however, Mu'awiya became the Khalifa, but there remained a section of Muslims who believed that the Khalifa of the Muslims could belong to the family of Muhammad
 unka maananaa tha ki yah khalipha swayan bhagwaan ke dwaara aadhyatmik maargdarshan paata he
 According to him Ali was the first Imam
 yah varg shiya varg ke naam se prasiddh hua
 The rest of the Muslims, who do not believe that only the family of Muhammad can be Khalifa, are called Sunni
 sunni pehle chaaron khalifaaon ko rashidoon khalipha kehete hai jiskaa arth he sahi maarg pe chalane vaale khalipha
 Khilafat became hereditary after Mu'awiya became the Caliph
 isse umayyad kilaafat kaa aarambh hua
 According to Shia history cars, Yazid, son of Mu'awiya, started working against the policies of Islam as soon as he got the Khilafat, religious Muslims became uncomfortable by his act, now Yazid needed to recognize his wrong policies from such a person Grant that all Muslims trust, for this work, Yazid gave the blessings of Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Ali Alaihis Salaam and Hazrat Muhammad's only Hazrat Hussain, son of the daughter of Fatimah, wanted to sanction his Khilafat but Hazrat Hussain refused to give his approval because of his actions against the policies of Islam
 On the refusal of Hazrat Hussain, the soldiers of Yazid, Hazrat Hussain and his 72 Stopped water on the companions and took their housemates hostage by killing them with great disrespect, sunni mat ke bade vidhwano imam ahamed bin hambl, imam gajali vagairah ne yajid ko qatle hossain karne kaa zimmedaar nahin mana he
 Hussein attained martyrdom in this battle
 shiya log 10 muharram ke din isi kaa shok manaate hai
 The Ummayd dynasty remained in power for 70 years and during this period they occupied North Africa, South Europe, Sindh and many parts of Central Asia
 ummyad vansh ke baad abbasi vansh 750 main satta main aayaa
 Shia and Ajmi Muslims greatly assisted the Abbasids in rebelling against the Ummayd dynasty
 ummyad vansh kii ek shakha dakshin spain or kuch or kshetron par simat kar rah gayi
 The notion of only an Islamic empire now began to wane
 abbasiyon ke raaj main islam kaa swarna yug shuru hua
 The Abbasid Khalifa gave great importance to knowledge
 muslim duniya bahut tezi se vishav main gyaan kendra banane lagi
 Many scholars studied books related to literature, philosophy, science, mathematics etc
 of ancient Yunnan, India, China and Persian civilizations and translated them into Arabic
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki is ke kaaran bahut bada gyaanakosh itihaas ke pannon main khone se rah gaya
 Muslim scholars did not just translate
 unhone in sabhi vishyon main apni chhap bhi chodi
 Many new discoveries related to anatomy and diseases in medical science were made in India, such as the difference between measles and smallpox was understood
 ibane seenaa ne chikitsa vigyaan se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin jo ki aage ja kar aadhunik chikitsa vigyaan kaa aadhaar baniin
 Therefore, Ibne Sina is also called the father of modern medicine
 isi tarah se al haitham ko prakaashiki vigyaan kaa pita or abu musa jabir ko rasayan shaastra kaa pita bhi kaha jaataa he
 Algebra got its English name from al-khwarizmi's book Kitab-al-jabar-val-muqabla
 al khwarizmi ko bijganit kii pita kaha jaataa he
 In Islamic Philosophy, the philosophy of ancient Greek civilization was developed with Islamic color
 ibane seenaa ne navaplatowad, arastuvaad or islamic dharamshastra ko jod kar siddhanton kii ek nai pranali kii rachana kii
 This created a new wave in philosophy known as Ibnisinism
 isi tarah iban rashud ne arestu ke siddhanton ko islamic siddhanton se jod kar ibnarashuwad ko janm diya
 The art of studying Islamic theology was developed with the help of dualism
 ise kalam kehete hai
 Finding the meaning of Muhammad Sahab's quotes, activities, etc
 and making laws from them became a subject in itself
 sunni islam main isse vidwaanon ke bich matbhed hua or sunni islam kanoonee maamalon main 4 hisson main bat gaya
 Politically, the Abbasid empire gradually weakened
 africa main kai muslim pradeshon ne 850 tak apane aap ko lagbhag swatantra kar liya
 The same situation happened in Iran
 sirf kehane ko yah pradesh abbasiyon ke adheen the
 Mahmud Ghazni even declared himself a Sultan

 He ruled many regions of Central Asia and Iran
 haalanki yah sabhi rajya aapas main yuddh bhi karte the par ek hi islamic samskruti hone ke kaaran aam logon main buniyadi sampark abhi bhi nahin tutaa tha
 This had a great impact on agronomy

 In Asia the Mongols conquered many empires and left Buddhism and converted to Islam
 muslim samrajyon or isaaiyon ke bich main bhi ab takaraav badhane laga
 Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty conquered Jerusalem in 1187, who had come to the Christians in the first Salebi war
 13veen or 14veen sadi se osmani samrajya kaa asar badhane laga
 He subjugated many territories in southern and eastern Europe and North Africa
 khilaafat ab vaid rup se osmani vansh kii hone lagi
 The Shia Safavi dynasty in Iran and the Delhi Sultans in India and later the Mughal Empire ruled
 naveen sadi se hi islam main ab ek dharmik rahasyavaad kii bhaavana kaa vikaas hone laga tha jise sufi mat kehete hai
 Ghazali made some such arguments in the context of Sufism and the futility of philosophy that the emphasis of philosophy began to wane
 sufi kaavyatmakataa kii pranali kaa ab janm hua
 Rumi's masnavi is a prime example of this
 sufiyon ke kaaran kai musalmaan dharm kii ore waapas aakarshith hone lage
 Many people of other religions also accepted Islam
 bharat or indonesia main sufiyon kaa bahut prabhaav hua
 Indian Sufi saints like Moinuddin Chishti, Baba Farid, Nizamuddin were part of this link
 1924 main turki ke pehle pratham vishwayuddh main haar ke baad osmani samrajya samaapt ho gaya or khilaafat kaa ant ho gaya
 Islam has also spread to Europe and America due to the migration of Muslims from other countries
 arab daishon main tel ke utpaadan ke kaaran unki arthvyavastha bahut tezi se sudhar gayi
 Many Renaissance movements took place in Islam in the 19th and 20th centuries
 in main se salfi or devbandi mukhya hai
 An anti-western sentiment also developed which led some Muslims to be attracted to fundamentalism
 vishwa main aaj lagbhag 1
3 arab se 1
8 arab musalmaan hai
 Of these, about 85% are Sunni and about 15% are Shia
 sunni or shiya ke atirikt islam main kuch anya varg bhi hai parantu in kaa prabhaav bahut kam he
 Most Muslims live in countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia
 madhya purv, africa or europe main bhi musalamaanon ke bahut samudaay rahete hai
 There are about 48 countries in the world where Muslims are in majority
 vishwa main kai desh aise bhi hai jahaan kii musalmaan jansankhya ke bare main koi vishwasaneey jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 Worship of Muslims is called Masjid
 masjid islam main keval ishwar kii prarthana kaa hi centre nahin hota he balkee yahan par muslim samudaay ke log vichaaron kaa aadan pradaan or adhyayan bhi karte hai
 Many amazing examples of Islamic architecture are often seen in mosques
 vishwa kii sabase badi masjid makka kii masjid al haram he
 Kaaba, the holy site of Muslims, is in this mosque
 madina kii masjid al nabavi or jerushlaim kii masjid e aqasaa bhi islam main mahatvapurn hai
 The family and social life of Muslims is influenced by Islamic laws and Islamic practices
 vivaah ek prakaar kaa kanoonee or saamaajik anubandh hota he jisaki vaidhata keval purush or stri kii marzi or 2 gavaahon se nirdhaarit hoti he 
 Islamic law gives women and men half of the inheritance
 striyon kaa hissaa purushon kii tulana main aadha hota he
 The two important festivals of Islam are Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul-azha
 ramadan kaa maheenaa bahut pavitra samajha jaataa he
 Muslims often name their children from the Arabic language to show their Islamic identity
 isi kaaran vah dadhi bhi rakhte hai
 In Islam, there is a lot of emphasis on wearing shame while wearing clothes
 isaliye adhiktar striyaan burka pahenti hai or kuch striyaan nakaab bhi pahenti hai
 Islam's contact with other religions has been influenced by time and situation
 yah sampark mohammad ke samay se hi shuru ho gaya tha
 Apart from Islam at that time, there were 3 traditions in Arabia
 ek to arab kaa purana dharm tha jisaki vaidhata islam ne nahin sweekaar kii
 The reason for this was that religion did not believe in the unity of God, which was against the basic principles of Islam
 isai dharm or yahudee dharm ko islam ne vaid to sweenkar kar liya par islam ke anusaar in dharmon ke anuyaayiyon or pujaariyon ne inamen badlaav kar diye the
 After reaching Madinah from Mecca, Muhammad entered into a treaty with the Jews there, in which the religious and cultural autonomy of the Jews was accepted
 arab bahudevvaadiyon ke saath bhi ek sandhi hooi jise hudaiba kii sulah kehete hai
 Since Muhammad, often political reasons have been determining the behavior of other religions or Islam
 jab rashidoon khalifaaon ne arab se baahar kadam rakhaa to unka saamana parsi dharm se hua
 He was also accepted as legitimate
 in sabhi dharmon ke anuyaayiyon ko dhimmi kaha gaya
 Muslim Caliphs had to pay a fee called Jizya or Jiziya
 iske badale rajya unhen haani na pahunchane or suraksha dene kaa vaada karata tha
 Those who embraced Islam were often discouraged during the tenure of the Ummayads
 iskaa kaaran tha ki kai log keval rajnatik or aarthik laabhon ke liye hi islam kabool karne lage the
 By this, the jizya or jizya was beginning to decrease
 bharat main islam kaa aagaman to arab vyapaaree 7veen sadi main hi le aaye the
 But the early Muslim sultans arrived in India only in the 10th century
 ab tak aadhikarik rup se in sulatanon kaa islamic khalifaaon se koi sambandh nahin tha
 Therefore, all of them adopted their attitude towards Hindu religion according to their understanding
 shuru main kuch muslim sultaanon ne hindu dharm kii kam jaankaree hone ke kaaran use puraane arab ke bahudevvaad ke saath joda
 Sufi saints and the Bhakti movement played a very important role in removing this estrangement
 2509 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of the year 2509 BC or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus

 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method

 Hindi story is the major narrative genre of Hindi literature
 aadhunik hindi kahani kaa aarambh 20 veen sadi main hua
 In the past century, Hindi story has made many achievements in the long journey through idealism, realism, progressivism, psychoanalyticism, regionalism, etc
 nirmal verma ke ve din jaise kahani sangrah sahitya academy se bhi sammanit ho chuke hai
 Premchand, Jainendra, Agnayya, Yashpal, Phaniswanath Renu, Usha Priyamvada, Mannu Bhandari, Gyanranjan, Uday Prakash, Omprakash Balmiki etc
 are the major story cars of Hindi
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne kishorilaal goswami likhit 'indumati' ko hindi kii pehali kahani mana he
 Generally two objections have been raised regarding this - one is that it may not be a translation of a Bengali story and the other is that it has a shadow of Tempest
 kaal-kram kii drashti se acharya shukla likhit 'gyaarah varsh kaa samay' duusari kahani thaharti he
 But even before these stories were written
 unki ore sanyogvash kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya
 In the 70s, 'sarika' published commentaries on the first Hindi story
 shri verma ne madhavaprasad sapre kii 'tokari bhar mitti' ko hindi kii pehali kahani siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The story 'pranayani' written by Kishori Lal Goswami is the first original story of Hindi
 yah san 1897 i main likhi gai thi
 It tells the story of two lovers
 premi premika ke ghar main pravisht hone kaa upkram kar hi rahaa tha ki raja dwaara chor samaj kar pakad liya gaya
 But after getting acquainted with their deep love, the king got them both married
 is par kathasaritsagar kaa prabhaav he
 The style is old, the ending is also from the Bharata sentence
 kintu yadi kahani kii pahchaan kathanmak style tathaa ek hi kendriya bhaavana ke aadhaar par kii jaayegi to yah nishciya hi hindi kii sarvapratham moulik kahani tehregi
 In fact, 1900 AD to 1915 AD was the first phase of development of Hindi story
 man kii chanchalta 1907 i gulbahaar 1902 i, pandit or panditani 1903 i, gyaarah varsh kaa samay 1903 i, duliwali 1907 i, vidya bahaar 1909 i, rakhiband bhai 1909 i, gram 1911 i, sukhmay jivan 1911 i, rasiyaa balam 1912 i, paradesi 1912 i, kaanon main kangana 1913 i, rakshabandhan 1913 i, usne kaha tha 1915 i, aadi ke prakaashan se siddh hota he ki is praarambhik kaal main hindi kahaniyon ke vikaas ke sabhi chinh mil jate hai
 By 1950, an elaborate phase of the Hindi story ends and the Hindi story enters a period of maturity
 san 1916 i, premchand kii pehali kahani sout prakashit hui
 With the advent of Premchand, Hindi fiction turned towards social truth
 premchand kii aakhri kahani 'kafan' 1936 i, main prakashit hui or usee varsh unka dehavsaan bha hua
 Many trends in the story emerged in this period of twenty years
 kintu in pravritiyon ko alag alag na dekhakar yadi samagrat: dekha jaay to is samooche kaal ko adarsh or yatharth ke dwandv ke rup main liya ja saktaa he
 'prasad' and Premchand represent the stories in this period
 prasad mukhyat romentic kahanikar hai
 But Indrajal, Gunda, Salim, punctuation, stored in his last story collection 'indrajal', can be identified with his real-life tendency
 par romentic hone ke kaaran ve adarshavaadi the
 Premchand has called himself an idealistic realist
 vastut: ve bhi adarshavaadi the
 But in the last period of his development, he became realistic after realizing the bitterness of reality
 'pus kii raat' or 'kafan' iske pramaan hai
 In the year '33, a collection of Nirala 'lily' was published
 uski kahaniyaan bahut kuch yathartwaadee hi hai
 Prasad's romantic ideal is also reflected in his early stories
 par chandradhar sharma 'guleri' kii kahani 'usne kaha tha' main yah apni puri rangini main miltaa he
 Prasad's important romantic stories were written after 'he Said'
 'usne kaha tha' apane pariparshv, charitra-kalpana, parinti main romentic he
 Premature sacrifice, sacrifice - even the recollection of death all fulfill some romantic ideal
 aath varsh kii ladki or baarah varsh ke ladke main jis prem kaa udai hota he vah pachchis varshon ke interval ke baad bhi is tarah ubhar aata he ki us romentic prem ke nimitt lahana singh praan de detaa he
 Reality has been ignored to protect this ideal
 is kahani kii takneekee uplabdhiyaan abhootpurv hai
 He is the first credit for incorporating theatricality, spatial color, color setting, vibrant narration, flashbacks, dreams, etc
 in the story
 prasad ne apni kahaniyon main gulerji kii katipay takneekee visheshtaon ko grahan kiya ha par ve mulat pragitatmak hai
 In elements, the narrative element is less, the emotion is more
 ve chhayavaad ke pratinidhi kavi hai
 His mind is more rooted in the heroic paintings of the past, the impressive natural environments, the romantic innards
 prem or soundarya ke chithran main unhone sarvaadhik manoyog se kaam liya he
 Another feature, which often remains untargeted, is that they gave personality to the characters in the story
 vyaktinishthata chhayavaadi kavy kii visheshta rahi he
 He also gave first person to the characters of the plays
 vahi baat kahani ko sambandh main bhi kahi ja sakati he
 The creation of a person character like Babu Nanhook Singh of 'gunda' is alone in uniqueness
 is prakaar madhulika, champa, salvati aadi bhi avismaraneey hai
 National consciousness is a feature of cinematic poetry
 ise 'puraskaar' jaisi kahaniyon main dekha ja saktaa he
 The deep inner core of the mind is the foundation of his story
 'akashadip' iskaa jeevant udhaaharan he
 All the elements of lyricism - for the sake of solitary affliction, monotony, etc
 are known visasati
 ek alag drashtikon apnaane ke kaaran unki kahaniyaan premchand kii kahaniyon se bhinn ho jaati hai
 Islio critics consider the stories of the Prasad Sanstha as distinct from the premchand-sansthan stories
 drushtikon kaa algaav sanrachana kaa algaav hota he
 His plot has fewer incidents and more reactions to situations
 falswaroop unamem naatakeeyata kaa praadhanya ho gaya he
 His characters also go through situations and establish their personality by their actions
 prakritik setting jahaan kahin bhi le ai gai he vah sampurna kahani kaa anivaary ang ban gai he
 Like Chhayavadi poetry, he too appears to be accused of human consciousness
 anubhuti or kalpana kaa itnaa ekthan sanyog anyatra nahin milegaa
 Premchand turned the stories from micro-life to macro-life
 prasad kii kahaniyon chhayavaadi kavy-chetana ke itane sameep he ki ve swayan pragitatmak ho gai hai
 The duality of mixed emotions in them is mainly poetic and personal, so the flow of normal life will not be found there
 premchand ne kahaniyon par ladi hui alankarita ko anlankrita kar unhen sahaj banaaya
 Thus a second separation appears in the early stories of Premchand
 ise saamanyat: adarshavaad ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 But he should call it reformism
 bade ghar kii beti kaa badppan, bal-vivaah kaa virodh, vidhwaa-vivaah kaa samarthan sudhaarwad ke antargat hi aata he
 But respectively they changed and they tried their best to assess the real Indian life
 is desh ke madhyavargeey samaaj ko itane vaividhya ke saath kahaniyon main chitrit karne kaa praytn kisi anya vyakti ne nahin kiya
 He has also written many stories in number - two hundred twenty four
 kuch hi kahaniyaan likhane ke baad praaia: kahanikar apane ko duhraane lagate hai kintu premchand ne apane ko duharaaya nahin he
 This is an indicator of their vision
 gharelu jivan kii samasyaon tathaa saamaajik jivan kii vidmbanaaon ko jis dhang se unhone chitrit kiya he ve bahut jatil to nahin par taatkaaleen pariwaron or sansthaaon ko ujagar karne main purnat: samarth hai
 His idyllic and uncultured narrative style is more in tune with the Indian narrative
 par baad main chalakar premchand ne anubhav kiya ki unke adarsh jivan main faleebhoot nahin hue
 So, leaving behind the imaginative ideal, he began to depict the pitfalls of real life
 'pus kii raat' or 'kafan' main unke badale hue drushtikon tathaa nai sanrachana ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Both these stories, especially the final story, can be called completely modern
 ye kahaniyaan kisi adarsh kii khunti par nahin tangi hai
 In these, the critic cannot tell that the story is a particular object
 ve apana sampreshy swayan hai-aadi se ant tak
 There is no culmination, there is no climax
 keval sanketikta he, pathakon kii kaalpana ko udaan bharne kii chhot he
 The linguistic process discussed in today's criticism can be seen at full height in them
 donon hi kahaniyaan anveshan kii prakriya kaa sundar namoona hai
 It is surprising to see that the clown whose clown is being seen in today's life is present in the 'shroud'
 kintu is vidooshakatv ko unhone rachanaatmak sandarbh main rakhaa he jo samooche samaaj ko nanga karte hue ek arthpurna moolyadrushti ko sankethik karata he
 As a result of a historical association, the loneliness and dehumanization of modern life has become ingrained in the same way
 yah hindi kii pehali aadhuniktaa bodh kii kahani he
 No sequence of development is targeted among the writers who became Prasad and Premchand Institute
 unki kahaniyon main apane swatantra vyaktitv kii jhalak praaia nahin milti
 Rayakrishnadas Prasad is the author of the institute
 chandiprasad hridayesh main prasad kii kaavyatmakataa nahin he, unki alankruti maatr he
 The authors of the Premchand Institute enumerate Sudarshan, Vishwambharnath Kaushik, Raja Radhikramprasad Singh, Bhagwati Prasad Vajpayee, etc
 san 1922 i main ugr kaa hindi-katha-sahitya main pravesh hota he
 Furious was neither romantic like Prasad nor idealistic realist like Premchand
 ve keval yathartwaadee the – prakruti se hi unhone samaaj ke nange yatharth ko shashakt bhashaa-style main ujagar kiya
 He was severely criticized by so-called purist critics for exposing the filth of society
 unke sahitya ko ghaslati sahitya kaha gaya
 He attacked the social ugly
 dojakh kii aag, chingaariyaan, balaatkaar, sanakee amir, chocolate, indradhanush aadi unki suprasiddh kahaniyaan hai
 These stories have been described as indecorous and tragic
 lekin yadi unki bahut si kahaniyaan amaryadit hai to aaj ke lekhakon kii anek kahaniyon ke sambandh main bhi yahi kahana hoga
 One pattern cannot be applied for the stories of extremists and another for today's similar stories
 aaj ke sandarbh main ugr kii kahaniyon par punarvichaar karne kii zarurat he
 The influence of Ugri can be seen on Chatursen Shastri, Rishabhacharan Jain etc
 27-28 i main jainendra ne kahani likhnaa aarambh kiya
 His first story was published in the game Vishal Bharat
 phaansi vaatayan neelam desh kii rajakanya, ek raat, do chidiyaan, paajeb, jaisandhi aadi unke kahani sangrah hai
 With his arrival, a new rise of Hindi-story begins
 nae utthan kaa matlab manovaigyanik kahaniyaan kehane se spasht nahin hota
 People create confusion by calling them Sharad Chandra of Hindi
 janendra main sharadchandra kii ruaansi bhavukta nahin he
 There is an exploration of a specific type of life-philosophy in Jainendra's stories
 prasad kii kahaniyon main bhi man kaa gaharaa dwandv chitrit hua he
 But the dimensions of this duality are limited
 jainendra man kii paraten ughaadte hai or uske madhyam se satyanveshan kaa prayaas karte hai
 This attempt at truth-telling through stories first appears in the stories of Janendra
 jainendra kaa kahana he – kahani to ek bhukh he jo nirantar samaadhaan paane kii koshish karti he
 We have our own questions, doubts, concerns and we keep trying to find answers, solutions
 hamaare prayog hote rahete hai
 



 is anveshan kii prakriya gandhivaadi ahimsa or frydwadi achetan man ke vyapaar se sambandh he
 Therefore, the question of moral values arises from place to place
 par jainendra main ek prakaar ke rahasy or guhyata ke bhi darshan hote hai
 This is both his specialty and weakness
 aage chalakar jahaan unka darshan shithil or anveshanheen ho gaya he bahaan uskaa tevar adhik sthool auki chatakila he
 Later stories have similar postures
 unki kahaniyon kii sanrachana vyakti ke bindu se shuru hoti he
 Some kicks of the subconscious mind are bounced
 ve kabhi apni hi kisi duusari pravriti athwa bahya naitikta se takaraati hai
 This clash turns into a story of self-aggression and ego separation
 unamem praaia taarkik anviti kaa abhaav miltaa he or uski purti ve tarkatit rahasy se karte hai
 For the next few days, the development of Premchand and Jainendra's traditions is considered to be the development of Hindi-story
 yashpal mulat premchand kii parampara ke kahanikar hai
 The Progressive Writers Association was established in '36
 is samay ke lekhakon kii rachanaaon main pragatishiltaa ke tatva kaa jo samavesh hua use yugdharm samajhnaa chahie
 Yashpal was an active revolutionary activist of the national struggle
 isaliye sahitya ke ve saadhan samajhate the, saadhy nahin
 It is clear that his stories have been written to fulfill some purpose
 premchand dhan ke dushman the to yashpal dhani ke
 The rich are the lepers of our society
 sari saanskrithik – naitik asangatiyon ke mul main dhan kii vishmata hi kriyasheel he
 Along with Marx, Freud also has a profound influence on them
 falat yon-chetana ke khule chitra bhi inke kahani upanyaason main milenge
 Dozens of his stories have been published - the flight of the cage, the world, the gift of knowledge, the curse, the storm of logic, the chinngari, the chinagari, the kurta of flowers, the mother of Uttami, etc
 yashpal kii kahaniyon ko drushtaant ke rup main grahan karte hai
 Hence their stories are employed a lot
 is niyojan kaa mukhya aadhaar kalpana he – anubhuti nahin
 His composition is very similar to Premchand's composition
 premchand kii kahaniyon main pehle koi sthir vichaar aata he or baad main uske anusaar kahani ke paatr, sthitiyaan ghatnaayen aadi ko anveshit kar liya jaataa he
 Yashpal's process is no different
 premchand main sudhaarwad kii pramukhataa he to yashpal main marxvad or frydwad kii
 They are storytellers of ideas, not thoughts
 saamaajik visheshtaon or madhyavargeey samaaj ke khokhalepan par gaharaa vyang karne main ye bejod hai
 The biggest feature of Yashpal is that the story's juice is found everywhere in him
 agyeya prayogdharma kalakaar hai
 With his arrival, the story turned towards a new direction
 jis aadhuniktaa bodh kii aaj bahut charchaa kii jaati he uske pratham puraskarta agyeya hi thaharte hai- kavy main bhi, katha-sahitya main bhi
 Apart from being experimental, they are also conscious of their ethnic rites
 unki aarambhik kahaniyon main romani vidroh dikhaai padataa he
 But they kept moving away from romance
 ahan ke visarjan kaa ullekh ve baar baar karte hai, yah romance se alag hone kaa praytn hi he
 His ego has not interfered in his best stories
 isaliye ve apni sanshlishtataa main apurv ban padi he
 His story collections are Vipagatha, tradition, Kothari ki Baat, Refugee, Jaidol and Yeh Tere Pratap
 pehle donon sangrahon kii kahaniyon main ahan kaa visphot or romani vidroh he
 The stories of the refugee have not become creative due to being driven by intellectual sympathy
 par jaydol sangrah kii kahaniyaan apana vishisht sthaan rakhti hai
 Ego is fully immersed in most of the stories in this collection
 apane se hat kar uski drushti main samagrata or rachana main sanshlishtataa aa gai he
 Two of his stories can be seen, for example
 'gangrene' main madhyavarg kii ekresata ko samagrat liya gaya he
 This monotony will be found at its structural level
 use parinti yaa nichod ke rup main nahin paaya ja saktaa he - use paane ke liye kahani ko samagrat hi lenaa hoga
 'gangrene' is a tremendous symbol of the monotony of middle class life
 par ise parivesh, flash back, bimb, pratik ke madhyam se rachaa gaya he
 Neither surplus words nor a lot of adjectives like early stories
 gharelu vaataavaran, teen kaa gajar, ghante kaa ton-ton, pipe kaa tap-tap aadi sabhi kuch ekares parivesh kii rachana karte hai
 The 'endurance of the plateau' has also become important due to its creative synthesis and sense of modernity
 do yugon kii prem-kahaniyaan jo apana alag alag bodh detii hai, ek aantarik sangati main bandhakar parabul ke nikat pahunch jaati hai
 Ashk Premchand is the storyteller of the tradition
 unhone bhi madhyavargeey samaaj se kathavstu kaa chayan kiya he
 Various story related experiments will be found in his work
 par prayogdharmi rachanaaon main ek prakaar kii ayasajnya kritrimata milti he
 a deep feeling of life is available in stories like Dachi, Kakdaan ka Teli
 ashk ke atirikt vrundavanlaal verma, bhagwaticharan verma, ilachandra joshi, amritlal nagar aadi upanyaaskaaron ne bhi kahaniyon ke kshetra main kaam kiya he
 But their real field is a novel, not a story
 iske baad san 50 i ke aasapaas se hindi kahaniyaan nae daur se guzarane lagati hai
 It is difficult to give a name to the trend of stories developed in these two decades
 yadi koi naam diya ja saktaa he to vah he aadhuniktaa bodh kii kahaniyaan
 Stories of complex-life-realism grounded in modernity, the mechanics of science and technology
 paramparaagat hindi kahaniyon se algane ke liye inhen nai nai kahaniyaan kaha jane laga
 Actually new stories were named after the new poem
 kuch log in kahaniyon ko purvavarti peedi kii kahaniyon kaa vikaas maanate hai or kuch parampara se katkar yaa use asweekaar kar ise ekadam nai kehane kii hathdharmi se baj nahin aate
 Actually, there is nothing meaningful in these names
 nai kahani se bhi apane ko algane ke liye or or naam rakhe gayi- sachetan kahani, akahani aadi
 But arguing over names is meaningless
 kahani to kahani he
 With the change of age, his tendencies will change
 swatantraaa – prapti ke kuch hi varshon baad bhartiya parivesh main prasannataa – avsaad ke virdohi swar sunai padane lage
 Some people were hopeful of fulfilling national aspirations and some people were disillusioned
 swatantraaa kii prapti ek romentic ghatana thi
 Romantic reality is depicted in the village and its associated stories
 shivaprasad singh, markendeya or fanishwarnath renu kii kahaniyon ko isi koti main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Jeevat is also found in some of his stories
 kintu is tarah kii adhikansh kahaniyaan, jane-samajhe or aanshik rup se bhoge yatharth par aadhaarit hone par bhi, puraane mulyon kaa hi pratipaadan karti hai
 In these two decades, faith in Dada, Baba, Mai was reversed and portrayed as a struggle of old and new values
 yah takaraahat nae badlaav kii soochna detii he
 Something has been broken in modern life that all the old relationships have changed
 ragapurn sambandh apane tanaavon main moolyaheen hone ke saath arthhin bhi ho gayi hai
 Mohan Rakesh has expressed these tensions mainly in his stories
 kamaleshwar tanaavon ke bich mulya drushti kii talash karte hai
 Nirmal Verma, while being romantically, effectively portrays today's social irony - meaningless scream - in some stories
 dharmaveer bharti, raghuveer sahay or naresh mehta kavi pehle hai or kahanikar baad main
 Among these, Bharti's personality is the most innate ability and value
 unki kahaniyon par unka kavi vyaktitv kahin haaavee nahin hota
 As soon as possible, he provides help
 is sangrah main sangrahit ‘gulki banno’ iskaa pramaan he
 Rajendra Yadav, Mannu Bhandari, Usha Priyamvada, Krishna Sobti, Srikanth Verma, Krishna Baldev Vaid, Rajkamal Chaudhary are the storytellers of the same tensions
 ye tanaav, pati-patni, pita-putr, bhai-bahan, premi-premika sabhi main dikhaai padenge
 a deep gap has been created between the individual and society
 tanaavon ke bich rahane vaale vyakti apane ko akele, ajanabi or santrast paa rahe hai
 This is not the condition of intellectuals of this country
 anya deshon ke log bhi il sthiti kaa or bhi tikhepan ke saath anubhav kar rahe hai
 The whole life has become so complicated and mechanical that humans have become mechanical
 uski apni pahchaan gum ho gai he
 The situation has deteriorated to the point that life means to him that he is meaningless
 ek or peedi
 That is, the works of Gyanranjan, Dudhanath Singh, Vijaymohan Singh, Ravindra Kalia, Mahendra Bhalla etc
 are the form of modernity in their stories that express boredom, suffocation, futility etc
 ye kahanikar praayah traasad maanviya sthitiyon se ubar nahin pate
 Among these storytellers, Gyanranjan's vision is able to capture the most balanced, non-romantic and new experiences
 agle daur ke kahanikaron kii suchi lambii he-kashinath singh, ibrahim sharif, israel, vishveshwar, sudhaa aroda aadi
 Kashinath Singh and Ibrahim Sharif have moved away from modernity and tried to find the right path in the anomalies of life
 arthhin jivan ko arth dene kii yah prakriya swasth pravriti kii suchak he
