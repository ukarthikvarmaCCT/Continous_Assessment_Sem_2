 It is basically a literary publication, but it has also published the best original and translated works of non-literary subjects
 raajakmal prakaashan kii sthapana 28 farvari 1947 ko hui thi
 At that time the country had not become independent, but amidst the apprehension of partition, the knock of freedom was clearly heard
 aise sankraman kaal main desh ke saanskrithik paksh ko majboot karne or hindi bhashaa tathaa samaaj kii asmita ko rekhaankit karne ke sankalp ke saath is prakaashan kii shuruyaat hui thi
 Its founder was the famous Hindi litterateur Dr
 Devraj
 prakaashan kaa vistaar hone par unhone apane bhai omprakash ji ko prakaashan ke sanchaalan hetu bulaayaa or is prakaar omprakash ji raajakmal prakaashan ke prabandh nideshak bane
 Omprakash ji proved to be the real founder of Rajkamal in terms of work
 apni paini sooyeeboojh tathaa lekhakon se sampark saadhane kii kushalta ke bal par unhone alp samay main hi raajakmal ko prakaashan kii unchaaiyon tak pahunchaa diya
 Rajkamal Prakashan has developed into a private limited institution
 yah kisi kii nijee yaa paitruk sampatti ke rup main nahin he, balki iskaa swaamitv sheyaron ke aadhaar par nirdhaarit hota he
 Thus it was initially owned by Aruna Asaf Ali
 kinhin muddon par omprakash ji se matbhed hone par ve is prakaashan ko lekar kathinaayee mahasoos kar rahi thim, tabhi shila sandhu ke pati hardev sandhu ne unase is prakaashan ke adhikansh share kharid liye or bahut-kuch matbhed kii sthiti main hi omprakash ji ke prabandh nideshak pad chhod dene ke baad hindi bhashaa se praayah anbhigya hone ke baavjood shila sandhu ne prabandh nideshak kaa pad sanbhaala
 Omprakash ji opened his independent publishing institute in the name of Radhakrishna Prakashan
 anek lekhakon se unke vyaktigat sambandh the or isliye bhi mohan rakesh jaise pratishthit kai lekhak raajakmal se dur ho gayi
 Sheela Sandhu faced double-triple difficulties, but she did not give up
 shila sandhu ucch shiksha praapt tathaa desh duniya dekhi hui mahila thi, parantu hindi bhashaa tathaa hindi bhashi samudaay se dur hone ke kaaran kathinaaiyaan swaabhaavik thim
 At such a time, Namvar Singh joined Rajkamal Publications as a publishing consultant
 "pehali june, 1965 se namvar ne raajakmal ke samast saahitiyik maamalon kii dekh-rekh kaa puraa daayitv le liya
 In addition to the decision of publication of the book, he was also asked to keep an eye on the policies of 'new stories' and 'criticism' magazines
 " swayan shila sandhu ke shabdon main "is kathin ghadi main namvar singh, jaadui vaktrutv evam adhyaapan style ke maalik, kii salaahkaar kii bhoomika jitani hi raajakmal ke liye jaruri thi utani hi mere liye
 "although his role suddenly raised the problem of partisan and personal politics of literature, but gradually all this was overcome and Rajkamal publication touched the heights
 dow0 namvar singh ne acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi evam dow0 ramvilas sharma ko raajakmal prakaashan se jodne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi's book Charu Chandralekh was already published by Omprakash ji from Rajkamal
 ab namvar singh ke praytn se unki tathaa dow0 ramvilas sharma kii adhikansh pustaken raajakmal prakaashan se prakashit huin
 Sheela Sandhu herself also joined Rajkamal by learning Hindi on the strength of her determination as well as making good connections with many writers
 rajendra singh bedi, upendranath ashk, nemichandra jain, bhishma saahani, bharat bhushan agarwal, nirmala, suresh avasthi, sarveshwar dayaal saxena, nirmal verma, kunwar narayan, prayag, raghuveer sahay, liladhar jagudi, manohar shyaam joshi, abdul bismillah or shrilaal shukla jaise lekhak judate gayi
 Rajkamal Prakashan became established as one of the most successful publishing institutes in the Hindi literature world
 aarambh main logon ko laga tha ki shila sandhu ke raajakmal kaa prabandh nideshak hone se yah prakaashan santhaan band ho jayega or yahan sandhu apana paariwarik vyavsaay motor parts kii dukaan shuru kar degi
 But with her diligence and determination, Sheela Sandhu not only removed this apprehension, but also earned the trust of Sumitranandan Pant, Bhagwati Charan Verma, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Shivamangal Singh Suman, Baba Nagarjuna and Phanishwar Nath Renu
 The type expanded the established fame of Rajkamal
 us samay raajakmal prakaashan kii pustakon kii chapai kaa electronic madhyam se koi vaasta nahin tha
 Sheela Sandhu used to accept handwritten manuscripts
 unhen tip kiya jaataa tha, phir usase letters press main pruf banaaya jaataa or tab lekhak un par apni anushansa dete
 Authors are contacted for book headings, advertisements and covers
 lekhakon ko kabhi bhi unki pustak ke prakaashan kii prakriya main bhaag lene se hatotsahit nahin kiya jaataa tha
 During the meetings of the Indian Publishers Association, Sheela Sandhu also tried to prove to herself that the royalty accounts of the authors can be made transparent by having a close relationship with them
 haalanki prakashkon ke bich yah vichaar lokapriy nahin ho paaya
 At that time, the books of Rajkamal Prakashan did not remain in the computer and there was nothing like printing and selling the same number of copies whenever desired
 ream ke ream kaagajon main chhapakar, bhaade ke godaamon ke milon lambey self main pustak surakshit rakhi jaati thi
 For this, half-yearly accounts, 'raw' lists had to be prepared and sprayed with regular medicines for protection against termites that eat 'lei' of books
 aaj ke yug main ye baaten haasyaaspad lag sakati he parantu us samay ke liye yah satya he
 Mohan Gupta's memorable contribution in the development of this publication
 kolkata se aae mohan gupt ne dhire-dhire sampadan kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaala or phir ve pustak ke sampadan, prakaashan-nirdesan evam mudran-prastutikaran sambandhi sabhi daayitv nibhaane lage
 Sheila Sandhu herself considers him 'one of the best editors and publishing managers of the Hindi publishing world'
 30 varsh tak is prakaashan santhaan ke safal sanchaalan ke baad shila sandhu isse alag huin or san 1994 main ashok maheshwari ne prabandh nideshak kaa pad sanbhaala
 Rajkamal Prakashan is on the path of development as the best publishing institution in Hindi literature world till date
 itnaa jarur he ki pustakon kaa mulya ab pehle kii tarah santulit nahin rahaa he
 Apart from this wild price increase, if there is any difference, it is that in the early period of this publication, Omprakash ji, who is known to the extent of creative and adventurous vision, 'left an indelible impression of excellent quality on Rajkamal publication' which published books
 The form of creativity remains intact even today, but due to the extremely levelless paper used in many books, this The quality of the area has collapsed to a great extent
 kuch hi samay main akhabaari kaagaj se bhi kai guna adhik durdashagrast sthiti main pahunch jane vaala yah motaa par kaaphi halkaa kaagaj raajakmal ke gaurav main nirantar batta laga rahaa he
 Rajkamal Prakashan took the unique initiative to publish the entire works of the best writers in a systematic and authentic manner by qualified editors to publish their compositions
 yojana ke rup main isaki pehali kadi thi hajariprasad dvivedi kii rachanawali, jise unke suputr mukund dvivedi hi sampadit kar rahe the
 Although this Rachnavali was published much later
 sabase pehle prakashit hone vaali rachanawali thi sumitranandan pant rachanawali jiske liye us samay raajakmal prakaashan ko pathakon se prakaashan purv agrim aadesh evam peshgi raashi praapt karne kaa sukhad sanyog mila tha
 After this, Rajkamal has established a record in this field by presenting the compositions of many excellent articles in very excellent form
 yahan se prakashit rachanawaliyon kaa vivaran nimnaankit sarini main drashtavy he- In the field of access to Hindi literature for general readers, Rajkamal created a textual revolution by taking the initiative to present the original book as a paperback edition of books
 aarambh main anek logon ne pathakon main saahitiyik ruchi kaa abhaav kii ashanka jataa kar paperbax kii safalataa par andeh prakat kiya
 But, when the second edition of Muktibodh Rachnavali also came in the form of paperbacks and three quarters of it was sold before publication, its unquestionable success was irrefutably attested
 is paperbax sanskaran ke kaaran gambhir sahitya ke pathakon main atyadhik vruddhi hui or yah prayog puri safalataa ke saath ab anivaaryta kaa rup le chukaa he
 These paperback editions have a double utility
 ek to inaki keemat kam hoti he, duusare is ke aavaran par suprasiddh kalakaaron kii kalakritiyon ke chitra dekar isaki mahatta dwiguneet kar di jaati he
 It was also started by Sheela Sandhu with the help of her second daughter
 raajakmal prakaashan ke dwaara hindi sahitya ke itihaas main sunishchit sthaan banane yogya 'aalochana' evam 'nayi kahaniyaan' jaisi do patrikaon kaa prakaashan bhi kiya gaya

 'nayi Kahani' was originally a story-focused magazine
 iske prakaashan kaa vichaar raajakmal prakaashan ke tatkaaleen prabandh nideshak omprakash kaa tha
 With his efforts, he appointed Bhairav prasad Gupta as editor for publication of this magazine in January 1960 and after four months of preparations, in May 1960 it got its entry
 bhairav prasad gupt ke elahabaad main hone ke kaaran iskaa prakaashan elahabaad se hi aarambh hua, parantu baad main iskaa prakaashan dilli se hi hone laga tathaa bhairav prasad gupt bhi dilli aa gayi
 Bhairav prasad Gupta edited 'new Stories' till January 1963 and brought it to the pinnacle of achievement both in terms of creative superiority and popularity

 By the sixth digit itself, its circulation had reached seventy five thousand

 Similarly, once the decision was taken to close the Allahabad branch of Rajkamal, Lok Bharti Prakashan, established at the same place by its immediate in-charge Dinesh Ji, also joined Rajkamal under mutual agreement in 2005 and thus the 'rajkamal Prakashan Group' was formed

 Hearing this, Herod the king and all Jerusalem with him were terrified
 or us ne logon ke sab mahayajakon or shastriyon ko ikatthe karke un se poocha, ki messiah kaa janm kahan hona chahie? unhone us se kaha, yahudiya ke baitalaham main; kyonki bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara yon likhaa he
 That you, Bethlehem, who is in the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the officials of Judah; For out of you will come a ruler, who will take care of my people Israel
 tab herodes ne jyotishiyon ko chupake se bulaakar un se poocha, ki tara thik kis samay dikhaai diya tha
 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "go and find out exactly about that child, and when he meets, tell me the news so that i too may come and bow to him

 or herodes ke marane tak vahiin rahaa; isaliye ki vah vachan jo prabhu ne bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara kaha tha ki main ne apane putr ko misr se bulaayaa puraa ho
 When Herod saw that the astrologers had mocked me, he was filled with anger; And sending people to Bethlehem and all the boys around it, who were two years old or younger, according to the exact time asked by the astrologers

 or dekh, tu garbhvatee hogi or tere ek putr utpann hoga; tu uskaa naam yishu rakhana
 that would be great; And will be called the son of the Most High; And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
 or vah yaqub ke gharaane par sadaa rajya karegaa; or uske rajya kaa ant na hoga
 Mary said to the angel, how will this happen? i do not even know the man
 swargadoot ne us ko uttar diya; ki pavitra aatma tujh par utrega or parampradhan kii samarth tujh par chaaya karegi isaliye vah pavitra jo utpann honevaala he, parameshwar kaa putr kehalaayegaa

 If in a country, only political organizations conscious of accomplishing specific objectives and interests by improper means, motivate the voters to get involved in voting, and thus collect their votes in their favor, then surely the election and voting arrangements Handing over to the government will be more creditable so that this work can be done with more responsibility
 utsav 1984 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho

 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra

 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order

 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc

 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically
