 Enterprise resource planning is a company-wide computer software system used for sharing and managing all resources, information and business functions through shared data repositories
 ek ERP pranali main ek seva unmukh vaastukala hoti he jisamen anukhandi hardware or software kii ikaiyaan tathaa "sevaayen" hoti hai jo ek local aria network par sanchaar karti hai
 This modular design allows a business to add or change modules, while maintaining data integrity, in a shared database that can be centralized or distributed
 ] The ERP initials originated as an extension of MRP and CIM
 anusandhan evam vishleshan form gartner dwaara 1990 main isko prachlit kiya gaya tha
 ERP systems now try to cover all the core functions of the enterprise, whatever the organization's business or manifesto
 These systems can now be found in non-production businesses, non-profit organizations, and governments
 ERP pranali kahalaane ke liye, ek software package ko kam se kam do pranaaliyon ke prakaarya pradaan karne chahie
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek software package jo vetan or lekha, donon kaary pradaan karata ho use takneekee taur par ek ERP software package kaha ja saktaa he
 Examples of modules in an ERP that previously used to be independent applications include: product life-cycle management, supply chain management, warehouse management, customer relationship management, sales order processing, online sales, financial, human resources, and decision support system
 kuch sanghathan - aamtaur par ve jinke paas software utpaadon ko ekikrut karne ke liye paryaapt aatanrik iti kshamta he- ERP pranali ke keval kuch hisson ko lagu karne kaa chayan karte hai or apni anya aplicoshan aavashyaktaaon ke liye ERP yaa swatantra pranaaliyon ke bahya antarafalak viksit karte hai
 For example, they may choose to use the human resource management system of one vendor and perform integration between systems themselves
 yah khudara vikritaon ke liye aam he, jahaan ek madhyam aakaar vaale khudara vikreta ke paas bhi ek asatat point of cell product or vittiya aplications honge or uske baad godaam prabandhan, karmchaariyon kii suchi, marchendajing or logisticks ke liye vishisht aplications kii ek shrankhla uplabdh hogi
 Ideally, ERP provides a single database containing all the data for software modules, including: graahakon, aapurtikartaaon or karmchaariyon ke liye data godaam or vibhinn swayan seva antarafalak abhigam niyantran - prakriya nishpaadan hetu praadhikaar staron ke aadhaar par upyogkarta visheshadhikaar anukulan - prakriya pravaah main vistaar, yoga or parivartan kii purti hetu The term enterprise resource planning is originally derived from manufacturing resource planning, which comes from material requirement planning
 MRP, ERP main tab parivartit hua jab "rootings" software vaastukala kaa ek pramukh hissaa ban gaya or ek company kii kshamta yojana gatividhi bhi maanak software gatividhiyon kaa ek hissaa ban gayi
 ERP systems typically manage a company's manufacturing, logistics, distribution, freight, shipping, invoicing and accounting
 ERP software kai vyavsaayik gatividhiyon jaise bikri, vipanan, vitaran, billing, utpaadan, maal prabandhan, gunvattta prabandhan or maanav sansaadhan prabandhan ke niyantran main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 The 1990s saw a huge increase in sales of ERP systems as companies faced the Y2K problem in their older systems
 Many companies took advantage of this opportunity to replace their old information systems with ERP systems
 This sales boom led to a slowdown in 1999, by which time most companies had already implemented their Y2K solutions
 ERP ko aksar galat tareeke se back offis pranali samajha jaataa he, jo yah darshata he ki graahakon or aam janata kaa isse koi pratyaksh sarokaar nahin he
 This is compared with front office systems, such as customer relationship management systems that connect directly with customers, or e-business systems such as e-commerce, e-government, e-telecom and e-finance, or supplier relationships management systems
 ERP kaa upyog puure udhyam tathaa uske kisi bhi prakaarya main kiya ja saktaa he
 All functional departments involved in activities or production are integrated into a system
 nirmaan, bhandaaran, laugisticks or soochna praudyogiki ke alaava isamen lekha, maanav sansaadhan, marketing or ranneetik prabandhan bhi shaamil honge
 ERP II means open ERP architecture of components
 Older, monolithic ERP systems became component oriented
 EAS - enterprize aplication suut, pehle viksit ERP pranaaliyon kaa nayaa naam he jisamen vyaper ke sabhi hisse shaamil hote hai or saamaanya internet broujar kaa istemaal karte hai
 Most ERP vendors' software packages accommodate best systems
 ek ERP pranali ko lagu karte vakt, sanghathan software kaa anurupan karne, yaa apni vyapaar prakriyaaon ko pradipt software main maujuud "sarvottam prathaon" ke anuroop sanshodhan karne ke bich kisi ek kaa chayan kar sakate hai
 Prior to ERP, software was developed according to business processes
 adhikansh ERP pranaaliyon kii jatilta or ERP karyanvayan main asafalataa ke nakaaratmak parinaamon ke kaaran, adhikansh vikritaon nen apane software main "sarvottam prathaon" ko shaamil kar liya he
 According to the seller, these "best practices" are the most efficient way for a specific business process in an integrated enterprise-wide system
 lugvigshaafen uniwarsity of aplide science ke ek adhyayan ne 192 companiyon kaa surveykshan kiya or yah nishkarsh nikaala ki jin companiyon ne udyog jagat kii sarvshereshth prathaon ko lagu kiya he unamem concigareshan, pralekhan, pareekshan or prashikshan jaise mahatvapurn pariyojna kaaryon main kami aayi he
 In addition, the use of best practices reduced risk by more than 71% compared to other software
 sarvottam prathaon kaa upyog IFRS, sarbence-oxle yaa besel II jaisi aavashyaktaaon ke anupaalan ko aasaan banaata he
 They can also help where the process is an object like electronic money transfer
 This is because the process of capturing and reporting legislative and commodity content can be easily coded within ERP software and then replicated with confidence across businesses that have similar business requirements
 vyavsaayon kii sabhi kaaryaatmak ikaayiyon main aplications or prakriyaaon kii vyapak gunjaaish hoti he; ERP software pranaaliyon kaa utpaadan kiya jaataa he jo aam taur par jatil hoti hai or karmchaariyon kii kaary paddatiyon main mahatvapurn badlaavon kii maang karti hai
 The implementation of ERP software is typically too complex for "internal" skills, so it is desirable and advisable to seek the help of professionally trained external consultants to implement these systems
 This is usually the most effective way to reduce costs
 teen prakaar kii sevaayen hai jinke liye niyukti kii ja sakati he - paraamarsh, anukulan or sahaayta
 ek ERP pranali ko lagu karne kii avadhi vyapaar ke aakaar, anukhandon kii sankhya, anukulan kii seemaa, parivartan kii gunjaaish or pariyojna kaa swaamitv grahan ke liye graahak kii ichha, par nirbhar karti he
 ERP systems are modulated, so it is not necessary to implement them all at once
 These can be divided into different levels or stages
 ek aam pariyojna main lagbhag 14 maheene or 150 ke aasapaas salaahkaaron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a small project can be planned and implemented within 3-9 months; Whereas, a large, multi-sectoral and multi-country implementation may take years
 karyanvayan kii avadhi bahut kuch anukulan kii vaanchit maatra par nirbhar karti he
 Companies often seek the assistance of ERP vendors or third-party consulting companies to implement ERP systems
 ye companiyaan aamtaur par teen kshetron kii peshewar sevaayen pradaan karti hai: paraamarsh, anukulan or sahaayta
 graahak sanghathan, swatantra kaarykram prabandhan, vyapaar vishleshan, parivartan prabandhan or UAT visheshgyon ko niyukt kar sakate hai, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki karyanvayan ke dauraan unki vyavsaayik aavashyaktaaon kii praathamikta bani rahe
 Data transfer is one of the most important activities in determining the success of an ERP implementation
 chunki sthanantaran se pehle kai mahatvapurn nirnay liye jate hai, ati yojanabaddh tareeke se aage badhanaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Unfortunately, data migration is the last activity before the production phase of an ERP implementation, so it is given little attention due to time constraints
 ek ERP karyanvayan kii safalataa ke liye data pravaas ranneetiyon ke nimnlikhit kadam sahaayak siddh ho sakati hai: ERP vendors have designed their systems according to standard business processes, based on best business practices
 Processes of different vendors are of different types but they all follow a standard, modular nature
 parinamswaroop, jo companiyaan ERP pranaaliyon ko lagu karnaa chaahati hai unhen apni maujuuda prakriyaaon ke anusaar ERP package ko dhaalane kii bajaay apane sanghathanon ko maanak prakriyaaon ke anusaar dhaalane ke liye baadhya hona padataa he
 Neglecting to map current business processes before starting ERP implementation is one of the main reasons for the failure of ERP projects
 yah isliye mahatvapurn he ki sanghathan ek ERP vikreta ke chayan or iske kriyanvayan se pehle vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa sampoorn vishleshan karen
 is vishleshan dwaara maujuuda sabhi vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa nakshaa taiyaar karnaa chahie, taaki aise ERP vikreta kaa chayan kiya ja sake jiske maanak anukhand sthapit sanghathan ke saath sarvaadhik nikatataa se jude hon
 adhik prakriyaatmak ekikaran praapt karne ke liye tab ridizin kaa karyanvayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Research indicates that the risk of mismatch in business processes can be reduced by: ERP karyanvayan un sanghathanon main adhik dushkar hota he jahaan lagbhag swatantra vyavsaayik ikaiyaan hoti hai, prayek ikai apane nafe nuksaan ke liye swayan jimmedaar hoti he, kyonki unamem se prayek kii alag prakriyaayein, vyapaar niyam, data shabdaarth-vigyaan, praadhikaar padanukram or nirnay centre hote hai
 Solutions include coordinating requirements by local change management professionals or, if this is not possible, federated implementation using loosely integrated instances that are specifically configured and / or optimized to meet local needs
 ERP kaa ek nuksaan aamtaur par yah bataaya jaataa he ki manakikrut ERP anukhandon ke saath mail khaane ke liye vyavsaayik prakriyaaon ke parivartan se pratispardhi shreshthata main kami aa sakati he
 Documented evidence exists where this actually happened, while other cases show that following ERP processes to the fullest can actually enhance sustainable competitive superiority
 ek ERP pranali kaa vinyas asal main keval in baton ke bich santulan baithaana hi he ki aap is pranali se kya kaam karwaanaa chaahate hai or yah pranali aapako kis prakaar kaam karne detii he
 Start with which modules to install, then integrate the system using configuration tables for the best possible adjustment with your company's processes
 anukhand- zyaadaatar pranaliyaan maatr isliye anukhandit hoti hai taaki kuch prakaaryon ko karyanvit kiya ja sake, lekin anya nahin hoti hai
 Some common modules such as finance and accounting are adopted by almost all companies; While other modules such as human resource management are not required by companies, they are not adopted
 udhaaharan ke liye ek seva pradaan karne vaali company ko sambhawatah nirmaan anukhand kii aavashyaktaa nahin padegi
 kai baar companiyaan kisi anukhand ko isliye nahin apanaatin kyonki unke paas swayan kii pranali maujuud he jo unki najar main behatar he
 In general, the more modules selected, the more the integration benefit will increase, but at the same time the cost, risk and related changes will also increase
 vinyas talikaay- ek vinyas talika company ko is pranali ke kisi vishisht pahalu ko apane chaynit vyavsaay ke tareeke ke anusaar dhaalane main sakasham banaati he
 For example, an organization may choose the type of inventory accounting - FIFO or LIFO -, or by whom it wants to identify revenue - geographic unit, product, or distribution channel
 tab kya hota he jab pranali dwaara pradipt vikalp samuchit na hon? aise main company ke paas do vikalp hai, lekin donon hi adarsh nahin hai
 That enterprise system can rewrite the codes, or continue to use the existing system and create interfaces between it and the new enterprise system
 Both options will increase the cost and time of the implementation process
 In addition they can also reduce the importance of integration benefits of this system
 pranali ke anukulan kii maatra jitna zyada hoga, aapurtikartaaon or graahakon ke bich sanchaar kii sahajata utani hi kam hoti jaayegi
 Many organizations did not have sufficient internal skills to implement an ERP project
 iske parinamswaroop kai sanghathan ERP karyanvayan ke liye paraamarsh sevaayen pradaan karne lage
 aamtaur par, ek paraamarsh team puure ERP karyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar thi, jisamen shaamil tha yojana, prashikshan, pareekshan, karyanvayan or anukulit anukhandon kii delivery
 anukulan ke udaahranon main shaamil hai, atirikt utpaada prashikshan; prakriya pravartak or karypravah kaa nirmaan; ERP kaa vyapaar main kis prakaar upyog kiya jaye, isamen sudhaar hetu visheshgy salaah; pranali anukulan; or sahaayta lekhan reportein, jatil data nishkarshon yaa vyapaar khufia karyanvayan
 Implementation costs for most mid-sized companies can range from twice the written price of an ERP user license
 Larger companies, especially multi-sectoral or multi-country companies, often spend significantly more than the cost of user licenses for implementation — spending up to three to five times is not uncommon for multi-sectoral implementations
 adhikansh ekal-uddeshy aplications ke vipareet, ERP packages main shuruyaat se hi purna strot code shaamil rahaa he or anurupan tathaa pradipt code ke vistaar ke liye vikreta samarthit team ides ke saath inako bheja jaataa rahaa he
 During the early years of ERP, when a potential client was considering internally developing its own unique solution, or gathering function-wide solutions by integrating multiple applications of the "best-of-breed", At the time, support for mature equipment guarantees and extensive customization was an important sales rationale
 packing ke dibbe se baahar nikalate hi kor pranali kaise kaam karti he, graahakon dwaara usko parvartit karne kii aavashyaktaa kii purti hetu ERP vikritaon ne pehle se hi maujuud "vinyas" suvidhaayen pradaan karke anurupan kii aavashyaktaaon ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The main differences between customization and configuration include: is vishleshan ke anusaar, ek ERP package kaa anurupan apratyaashit rup se mahangaa or jatil ho saktaa he, tathaa ek ekikaran pranali ke spasht laabhon kii prapti main deree kar saktaa he
 However, customizing an ERP suite provides scope for applying secret technologies to excellence in specific areas, as well as ensuring that industry best practices can be implemented in less sensitive areas
 is sandarbh main "vistaar" un tareekon ko darshata he jinke dwaara pradipt ERP vaataavaran ko tritiy-paksh kaaryakramon dwaara badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 It is technically easier to open most ERP exchanges to external programs, for example, xxrep 4 
 chunki ERP aplications main aamtaur par jatil niyam shaamil hote hai jo master data ke nirmaan or parivartan ko niyantrit karte hai, kuch paridrishyon kaa karyanvayan bahut mushkil ho jaataa he
 Maintenance and ancillary services include, monitoring and managing an operational ERP system
 This function is usually provided internally with the help of members of the IT department, or may also be provided by an external specialist consulting and services company
 ek ERP pranali kii anupasthiti main, ek bade nirmaataa ke paas kai software aplications ho sakate hai jo ek duusare se prabhavi rup se samvaad yaa interphes sthapit karne main asamarth hon
 ek duusare ke saath interphes sthapit karne vaale kaaryon main shaamil hai: The ERP system centers the data in one place
 iske laabhon main shaamil hai: Some security features are included in an ERP system to provide protection against external crime such as industrial espionage and internal crime such as embezzlement
 For example, a scenario of data tampering could be that a disgruntled employee is deliberately keeping prices below their lowest level so that the company's profits can be manipulated or incurred in some other way
 
 ERP systems generally facilitate internal control against such acts
 ERP vikreta anya prakaar ke soochna suraksha upkarnon ke saath behatar ekikaran kii ore bad rahe hai
 The problems with ERP systems are primarily due to insufficient investment in the training of the IT personnel involved - including those who implement and test the changes - as well as the lack of corporate policy towards protecting data integrity and how they are used

 Nevertheless, Vijay Amritraj retained his place and defeated Jimmy Connors in a five-set match in the quarter-finals of 1981 at Wimbledon
 is tarah ke five saturs khelnaa vijay kii khaasiyat thi
 He was a natural grass-court player and relied more on serve and volley

 He belonged to the Ikshvaku clan and was the father of Lord Shri Ram, an incarnation of Vishnu
 dasharath ke charitra main adarsh maharaja, putron ko prem karne vaale pita or apane vachanon ke prati purna samarpit vyakti darshaya gaya he
 He had three wives - Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 angadesh ke raja romapad yaa chitrarath kii dattak putree shaanta maharishi rishyashrung kii patni thim
 According to one incident, Shanta was the daughter of Dasaratha and was adopted by Rompad
 dasharath adhed umr tak pahunch gayi the lekin unka vansh samhaalane ke liye unka putr rupi koi vanshaj nahin tha
 He thought of performing Ashwamedha Yagna and Putrakameshti Yagya for son Kamana
 unke ek mantri sumantra ne unhen salaah di ki vah yah yajna apane damaad rishyashrung yaa saadhaaran kii bolchaal main shrungi rishi se karavaayen
 Brahmarshi Vashistha was the total guru of Dasharatha
 vah unke dharm guru bhi the tathaa dharmik mantri bhi
 Only the Dharma Guru had the right to preside over all their religious ceremonies
 atah vashishtha kii ajna lekar dasharath ne shrungi rishi ko yajna kii adhyakshata karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The Sringi Rishi completed both the Yajna well and during the Putrakameshti Yajna, a supernatural yagya Purusha or Prajapatya Purush was born out of the Yagya Vedi and by offering Prasad of Naivedya in the Swarnapatra to Dasaratha, he said that by giving this prasad to his wives, he will get the son
 Can
 dasharath is baat se ati prasann huye or unhone apni pattarani kaushalya ko us prasad kaa aadha bhaag khilaa diya
 Dasharatha gave half of the remaining part to his second queen Sumitra
 uske bache huye bhaag kaa aadha hissaa unhone kaikeyi ko diya
 After thinking some, he also gave the remaining eighth part to Sumitra
 sumitra ne pehla bhaag bhi yah jaanakar nahin khaaya tha ki jab tak raja dasharath kaikeyi ko uskaa hissaa nahin de dete tab tak vah apana hissaa nahin khaayegi
 Now Kaikeyi ate his share first and Sumitra then ate his share
 isi kaaran ram, bharat tathaa lakshmana va shatrughna kaa janm hua
 After Rama's marriage to Sita, Dasharatha announced that Rama's coronation would take place immediately
 kaikeyi kii ek kubadi daasi thi manthra jisane kaikeyi ko bachapan se paal-pos kar bada kiya tha or kaikeyi ke vivaah ke baad maano uske dahez main uske saath bheji gai thi
 She was a devious politician
 usne kaikeyi ko mantranaa di ki ram ke rajbhishek se kaikeyi kaa bhala nahin varan anhith hi hone vaala he
 He advised Kaikeyi to ask for his two brides from King Dasaratha
 yah ghatana us samay kii he jab dasharath devon ke saath milakar asuron ke viruddh yuddh kar rahe the
 While chasing the Asuras, his chariot got trapped in the mud of war
 us rath kii sarathi swayan kaikeyi thim
 At the same time, Dasharatha was injured by an enemy running a war and he died
 yadi kaikeyi unke rath ko ranbhumi se dur le jaakar unka upachaar nahin karatin to dasharath kii mrityu nishchit thi
 Dasharatha regained consciousness and requested Kaikeyi to ask for any two brides
 us samay ayodhya samrajya kii paristhitiyaan anukool thim tathaa sabhi sauhardrapurn vaataavaran main ji rahe the atah kaikeyi ne vah var maangane se inkaar kar diya or yah kah kar taal diya ki samay aane par vah yah var maang lengi
 Now that Kaikeyi had come to the disguise of the evil Manthara, he realized that he was going to suffer harm after the coronation of Shri Ram, he thought of going to Kopabhavan
 us kaal main ranivas main ek kopbhavan hota tha jahaan koi bhi rani kisi bhi karanvash kupit hokar apni asahmati vyakt kar sakati thi or raja kaa kartavya hota tha ki use kopbhavan ke praangan main jaakar us rani ko manaanaa padataa tha
 King Dasaratha did the same
 jab kaikeyi ne apane do var maangane kii ichha darshai to kamonmukt raja dasharath raji ho gayi
 It should not be forgotten here that Kaikeyi was the youngest queen of Dasharatha and King Dasaratha himself reached the fourth period
 atah unka kaikeyi ke prati vaasana jaagnaa swaabhaavik tha or us vaasana ke liye jo bhi ban pade vah nibhaane ke liye raja dasharath tatpar rahete the
 Now Kaikeyi asked the king Dasharatha for that two bridesmaids
 ek se swayan ke putr bharat ko ayodhya kii rajgaddi tathaa duusare se ram ko chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas
 King Dasharatha could not do this
 unhone kaikeyi ko bahut manaane kii koshish kii
 He was also called bad
 lekin jab kaikeyi ne unki ek na maani to vah aahat hokar vahiin kopbhavan main gir gayi
 When Rama came to know about this subject, he himself went near Dasaratha and urged him that he should give Kaikeyi both brides keeping in view the dignity of Raghukul
 unhone hath karke raja ko in baton ke liye manaa liya or sanyasiyon ke vastra pahanakar sita tathaa lakshmana ke saath van kii ore nikal pade
 Dasaratha could not tolerate this shock and gave up his life
 ramayana main dasharath kaa naam iske baad tabhi aayaa he jab ram apane aapako dasharath-putr kahkar yaa to sambodhit karte hai yaa phir apana is sandarbh main parichay dete hai

 It is the process by which the absorption and emission of infrared radiation into the atmosphere by hot gases is reduced to another planet's surface in the atmosphere
 greenhouse prabhaav ke rup main astitv is prakaar vivaadit nahin he
 Naturally possessing greenhouse gases means a heat effect of about 33 ° C, which will not be habitable on Earth
 
prithvi par mahatvapurn grinhause gaisen hai, jal-vaashp, jo ki 36–70 pratishat tak greenhouse prabhaav paidaa karata he ) ; carbon dioxide jo 9-26 pratishat tak greenhouse prabhaav paidaa karata he; methane 4-9 pratishat tak or ozone, jo 3-7 pratishat tak prabhaav paidaa karti he imuxxa yah he ki maanviya gatividhiyon se jab kuch greenhouse gaison kii vayumandaleey sandratha badhati he tab greenhouse prabhaav kii shakti kaise parivartit hoti he
 Human activity has increased since the Industrial Revolution, which has led to a significant increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, which has also led to greatly increased diffuse bound CO 2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC and s nitrous
 Methane is more effective than greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but its concentration is so low that its radiative strength is only one f, compared to carbon dioxide
 Some other gases that are naturally occurring contribute to the greenhouse effect

 There is a possibility of higher CO2 levels in the future as there is a lot of change in fossil fuels and land use
 The rate of increase will depend on uncertain economic, social, technological and natural phenomena but perhaps the availability of fossil fuels will ultimately prove to be the deciding factor
 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the World tells of several future CO2 scenarios that last from the end of 2100 to 541 to 970 P
 Can be up to PM

 The effects of climate factors on climate are complicated by various processes
 sarvaadhik spasht pratyuttaron main se ek kaa sambandh jal ke vashpikaran se he
 The heat produced by the mixing of long-term greenhouse effect gases such as carbon dioxide causes a greater amount of water vaporization in the atmosphere

 Whether the net effect is hot or cold depends on details like cloud type and height
 jalwaayu ke pratimaanon par in vivaranon ko pradarshit karnaa kathin hota he kyonki jalwaayu pratimaanon ke sanganak khaanon par rikt sthanon ke binduon ke bich kii tulana main badal bahut chote hote hai
 As the atmosphere gets warmer, the advisory response process is related to the change in the lapse rate
 kshobhamandal unchai main badhotari hone ke saath-saath vayumandal kaa taapmaana ghatata jaataa he
 The emission of infrared radiation depends on the fourth power of temperature, longer radiation is emitted from the top layer of the atmosphere and less than the lower layer
 zyaadaatar vikiran jo upari vaataavaran se utsarjit hoti he khala main chali jaati he, jabaki nichle vaataavaran se utsarjit hone vaali vikiran dobaaraa vatavarav dwaara sokh lee jaati he
 Thus, the greenhouse effect depends on the speed at which the temperature in the atmosphere decreases with elevation, if the temperature rate is low then the greenhouse effect will be higher and if the rate of temperature fall is low then the greenhouse effect will be less
 siddhant or model donon yah sanket karte hai ki varming se oonchai ke saath taapmaana kaa girnaa kam ho jayega, jisase ek nakaaratmak lapse rate feedback paidaa ho jayega or isse green house asar kamazor hoga
 The measurement of the rate of temperature change with altitude is very sensitive to small errors, which makes it very difficult to find whether the model matches the reality

 Two researchers from Duke University, Bruce West and Nicola Scafetta have estimated that the sun contributed to a temperature increase of perhaps 45–50 percent by 1900–2000, and raised temperatures by about 25–35 percent between 1980 and 2000

 The land in the northern hemisphere is more jiada, so it heats up faster than the southern hemisphere
 Seasonal ice and sea in the northern hemisphere There are extensive areas of ice that depend on ice-albedo feedback in the northern hemisphere, more than in the southern hemisphere
 Green house gases are emitted, but it is not responsible for the difference in heat as the major greenhouse gases stay for a long time and mix well in both hemispheres

 These models are based on the physical principles of fluid dynamics, radiative transfer and other processes, simplification has been done on cut wakes because computers have their own limitations and the hydrological system is very complex
 Surrey modern climate models are an abstract model in itself
 And this is different with the model of the sea and the model of ice on land and sea
 In some models chemical and biological Treatments of processes are also involved
 This model finds that if the effect of greenhouse gases is added, a warmer climate is attained
 Nevertheless, even when this assumption is used, climate sensitivity still has a large role

 contends that if they must bear the cost of reducing emissions, then China should do the same
 a number of issues are often raised in relation to global warming

 sangheey sarkaar america ke samvidhan main di gai shaktiyon ke anusaar hi nigam sansthaaon ko bana sakati he

 ek baar gathan hone ke pashchaat, nigam apane dwaara sanchalit har jagah par kritrim vyakti ke rup main tab tak kaary kar sakate hai jab tak ki nigam bhang na ho jaae
 ek nigam jo anya rajya main gathit ho kar duusare rajya main sanchaalan kare, use "videshi nigam" kaha jaataa he
 This label also applies to corporations formed outside the United States
 videshi companiyaan aamtaur par prayek rajya main rajya ke karyaalay ke sachiv ke saath panjikrut honi chahien, taaki us rajya main vyapaar kaa vidhiwat sanchaalan kar sake
 The corporation is legally a citizen of the state in which it is formed
 
 korporate vyapaar ke kanoon rajyon ke anusaar alag alag ho sakate hai, tathaa kai bhavi nigam us rajya ko gathan ke liye chunate hai jiske kanoon unke vyapaar ke hiton ke liye sarvaadhik anukool hai
 For example, many large corporations are formed in Delaware despite not being physically located there, because the corporation tax and disclosure laws of that state are very favorable
 gopneeyata yaa parisampatti sangrakshan ke liye companiyaan aksar nevada main gathit hoti hai, jahaan swaamitv ke share prakatikaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Many states, especially smaller states, have made their corporation constitution in line with the Model Business Corporation Act, one of several model statutes of law created and published by the American Bar Association
 kanoonee vyaktiyon ke rup main, nigamon ke paas prakritik vyaktiyon ke samaan kuch adhikaar hote hai
 Most of them associate with corporations under state law, particularly the law of the state in which the company is formed - since the existence of corporations depends on the laws of that state
 kuch adhikaar sangheey sanvaidhanik or vaidhanik kanoon dwaara bhi sanlagn he, lekin prakritik vyaktiyon ke adhikaron kii tulana main kam tathaa anaavashyak hai
 For example, a corporation has the personal right to sue and, like a natural person, a corporation can be prosecuted
 lekin nigam ko apane dharm kaa prachaar karne kii koi sanvaidhanik azaadi nahin he kyonki dharm kaa prachaar keval "prakritik" vyakti hi kar sakate hai
 That is, only human beings have the necessary manpower of faith and spirituality in place of business institutions which enables them to believe and propagate religious beliefs

 The second of Harvard's two governing bodies, established in 1636, was formed in 1650 by the Great and General Court of Massachusetts
 gauratlab he ki masachusets us samay swayan ek nigam colony tha- jiskaa swaamitv or sanchaalan masachusets be company dwaara kiya jaataa tha - is prakaar harvard college ek ek nigam ke dwaara banaaya gaya nigam he
 Many countries have made their corporation laws in line with US business laws

 In addition to specific corporations in the United States, the federal government promulgated the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971 that provided 12 regional country corporations for Alaska Native and more than 200 village corporations that were entitled to agreements for land and cash

 In many countries the profits of the corporation are taxed / taxed according to the rate of corporation tax and dividend paid to shareholders is taxed at a different rate
 is tarah kii pranali ko kabhi kabhi "doharaa karadhaan" kaha jaataa he, kyonki shairdharakon ke bich vitarit kiye gaye kisi bhi laabh par antat do baar kar lagegaa
 labhaansh praapt karne vaale ke liye iskaa ek samaadhaan tex credit kaa haqadaar hona he jo is tathy par aadhaarit he ki labhaansh dwaara pradarshit laabh par pehle hi kar lagaaya ja chukaa he
 Thus the profit given by the company will be taxed only on the dividend received by the final recipient
 In other systems, dividends are taxed at a lower rate than other earnings or shareholders are taxed directly on the corporation's profits, and dividends are not taxed
 
 jaisaa ki adam smith ne velth of neshans main bataaya he, jab prabandhan se swaamitv alag ho jaataa he, to baad vaala anivaary rup se pehle ke hiton kii upeksha karegaa, jisase company main samasya paidaa hogi

 Ever since Gokul became the center of the Vallabh sect, literature related to Krishna began to be written in Braj Bhasha
 isi ke prabhaav se braj kii boli saahitiyik bhashaa ban gai
 From the famous Mahakavi Mahatma Surdas of Bhaktikal to the famous poet Shri Viyogi Hari of modern times, the poetry of Braj and Muktak poetry were composed from time to time
 janapadiya jivan ke prabhaav se brajabhasha ke kai rup hamen drushtigochar hote hai
 But with a slight difference we can see a clear glimpse of uniformity in them
 brajabhasha kii apni rupagat prakruti aukarant he arthath isaki ekvachaneey puling sangyaayen tathaa visheshan praaia: aukarant hote hai; jaise khurpu, yamrau, maanjhu aadi sangya shabd aukarant hai
 Similarly, the adjective terms karau, gorau, savanrau etc
 are immediate
 kriya kaa saamaanya bhootkaalik ekvachan puling rup bhi brajabhasha main pramukhroopen aukarant hi rahata he
 It is different that "Y" Shruti proceeds are also found in some of its areas
 jila aligarh kii tehsil kol kii boli main saamaanya bhootkaaleen rup "y" shruti se rahit miltaa he, lekin jila mathura tathaa dakshini bulandshahr kii tahseelon main "y" shruti avashya pai jaati he
 like : ""karau chhora bolau"" -
 "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau launda bolgau"" -
 Kannauji has its own nature
 sangya, visheshan tathaa kriya ke roopon main brajabhasha jahaan aukarantata lekar chalati he vahaan kannauji okarantata kaa anusaran karti he
 In the district Braj language of Aligarh district, if we say "" Carou Chora Bolou "", then it will be said in Kannauji that - "" Say Caro Lurika
 bhavishyatkaleen kriya kannauji main tidhntaroopini hoti he, lekin brajabhasha main vah kridantarupini pai jaati he
 If we convert the words "boy will go" and "girl will go" into Kannauji and Brajbhasha, we will give the following form: kannauji main - larika jaihai
 Daughter is brajabhasha main - chhora jaigau
 Will be left
 uparyukt udaahranon se spasht he ki brajabhasha ke saamaanya bhavishyat kaal rup main kriya karta ke ling ke anusaar parivartit hoti he, jab ki kannauji main ek rup rahati he
 Apart from this, Kannauji also has a tendency to discolour like Awadhi, which is lacking in Braj Bhasha
 kannauji ke sangya, sarvnaam aadi vaakyapadon main sandhirahitya praaia: miltaa he, kintu brajabhasha main ve pad sandhigat avasthaa main milte hai
 Examples : kannauji -""bau gao"" 
 Brajbhasha - "" Bo Gayou ""
 uparyukt vaakyon ke sarvnaam pad "bau" tathaa "bo" main sandhirahitya tathaa sandhi kii avasthaaen donon bhashaaon kii prakrutiyon ko spasht karti hai
 Keeping in view the linguistic variation of the Braj Bhasha region, we can divide it as follows: kendriya braj arthath adarsh brajabhasha - aligarh, mathura tathaa pashchimi agre kii brajabhasha ko "adarsh brajabhasha" naam diya ja saktaa he
 This name can be given to the language spoken in the north west of Gwalior - Budeli influenced Brajbhasha
 rajasthan kii jaipuri se prabhavit brajabhasha - yah bharatpur tathaa uske dakshini bhaag main boli jaati he
 Sikarwadi Brajbhasha - This form of Brajbhasha is prevalent in the north east region of Gwalior where settlements of Sikarwad Rajputs are found
 jaadobati brajabhasha - karauli ke kshetra tathaa chambal nadi ke maidan main boli janevaali brajabhasha ko "jadobari" naam se pukaara gaya he
 There are settlements of Jadau Rajputs here
 kannauji se prabhavit brajabhasha - jila eta tathaa tehsil anupshahar evam atarauli kii bhashaa kannauji se prabhavit he
 The following examples are visible for how the district Braj language of Braj-speaking region has changed from west to east
 jila gudgaanv main - ""tamaso dekhne ku gaye
 You are getting angry with me
 tab gaano band ho gayo
 "" jila bulandshahr main -""launda gom ku ayu or bahu su bolgau kai main naukri ku jangau

 Aryashtangam Marg is one of the major teachings of Mahatma Buddha, which has been described as a means of attaining freedom from suffering and self-knowledge
 ashtaang maarg ke sabhi 'maarg', 'samyak' shabd se armbh hote hai 
 In Buddhist symbols, ashtanga passages are often represented by the eight todos of the Dharmachakra
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is - the way to get rid of sorrow
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi
 bhagavan buddha ne bataaya ki trishna hi sabhi du:khon kaa mul kaaran he
 Due to craving, man tends towards different things in the world; And when he cannot get them or when they are destroyed even after receiving, then he feels sad
 trishna ke saath mrityu praapt karanevaala praani uski prerana se phir bhi janm grahan karata he or sansar ke du:khachakr main pisataa rahata he
 Therefore, the way to satisfy Trishna completely is the path to salvation
 ise du:kha-nirodh-gamini pratipada kehete hai
 Lord Buddha has given eight parts of this path: is maarg ke pratham do ang pragna ke or antim do samadhi ke hai
 The middle four are of modesty
 is tarah sheel, samadhi or pragna inhen teen main aathon angon kaa sannivesh ho jaataa he
 Only when modesty is pure can one enter into spiritual life
 shuddh sheel ke aadhaar par mumukshu dhyanabhyas kar samadhi kaa laabh karata he or samadhisth avasthaa main hi use satya kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is called Pragya, as soon as it becomes enlightened, the seeker is interviewed with the impermanent, anonymous and sad nature of mere power
 pragna ke alok main iskaa agyanandhkaar nasht ho jaataa he
