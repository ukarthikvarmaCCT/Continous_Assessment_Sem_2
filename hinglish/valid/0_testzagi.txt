 Fertilized, transformed and mature ovaries are called fruits
 saadharantah fal kaa nirmaan phool ke dwaara hota he
 The female reproductive ovary of the flower is transformed by the process of fertilization to produce fruit
 kai padap prajatiyon main, fal ke antargat pakv andashay ke atirikt aasapaas ke utak bhi aate he
 Fruit is the medium through which flowering plants propagate their seeds, although not all seeds come from fruits
 kisi ek paribhaasha dwaara padpon ke falon ke bich main paayi jane vaali baari vividhta kii vyakhya nahin kii ja sakati he
 The term pseudo-fruit is used for fruits like figs or for plant structures that look like fruits but do not originate from flowers or flowers
 kuch anavrutbiji, jaise ki euu ke maansal bijchol fal sadrush hote he jabaki kuch juniparon ke maansal shanku beri jaise dikhte he
 The term fruit also incorrectly refers to the seed-bearing female cones of many coniferous trees
 vanaspatik arth ke kuch vaastavik falon, ko khaanaa pakaane or bhojan taiyaar karne main, sabji, maatr isliye mana jaataa he kyonki ve mithe nahin hote
 These floral fruits include legumes, tomatoes, peas, beans, maize, brinjals and sweet peppers, some spices such as allspice and chillies
 kabhi kabhi, lekin bahut kam, ek pakya "fal" vanaspatik arth me ek vaastavik fal nahin hota, udhaaharan ke liye revatcheeni ko aksar ek fal mana jaataa he kyonki iskaa upyog mishthan banane me kiya jaataa he, haalaanki revatcheeni kaa sirf danthal hi khaane yogya hota he
 In the culinary sense, a fruit is usually a vegetable product that has a sweet taste and contains seeds, a vegetable is a faded or less sweet vegetable product and a kernel is a hard oiled and shell vegetable product
 haalanki, giri fal kaa ek prakaar he, yah moongfalee or pista jaise khaadya bijon ke liye ek lokapriy shabd bhi he
 Technically, a single grain of a grain is also a fruit called choriopsis
 However, their fruit wall is very thin and attached to the seed coat, thus almost all edible grain grains are actually a seed
 isliye anaaj ke dane jaise makka, gehun or chaaval ko behatar, khaadya beej mana jaataa he, haalanki kuch sandarbhon me inhen fal mana jaataa he
 The fruit is a mature ovary
 andashay ke andar ek yaa adhik bijand hote hai, jahaan megagamitophite me megagamit yaa and koshikayen hoti he
 The spore is fertilized by a process called pollination, in which pollen particles are transmitted from the stamens of the flowers to the stigma
 paragan ke baad, ek nalika banati he jo vartikagra se andashay ke bijand tak jaati he jahaan paraag se shukranu bijand main sthanantarit hote hai, bijand ke andar shukranu and ke saath judakar ek diploid zaigot kii rachana karte hai
 In flowering plants, the process of fertilization can occur by either plasmogamy where fusion of sperm and egg protoplasm occurs, or cariogamy where the nucleus of sperm and egg meet
 jab shukranu bijand ke nabhik main pravesh kar megagamit or bhrunposh matra koshika ke saath jud jaataa he tab nishechan prakriya puri ho jaati he
 The maturation of the ovaries begins as the developing seed grows
 bijand kaa vikaas beej ke rup main hone lagata he, andashay kii diwaar gaddedaar ban sakati he, yaa yah ek kathor bahari aavaran me viksit ho sakati he
 In some cases, sepals, convulsions and / or stamens and suppositories collapse
 jab tak beej puri tarah paripakv nahin ho jate, fal kaa vikaas jari rahata he
 The growth of pulp in some multiple BG fruits depends on how many spores are fertilized
 fal bhitti, pushp ke andashay kii diwaar se viksit hoti he
 The fruit wall often develops into two or three different layers that can be differentiated into the outer wall, medial wall and the inner wall
 kuch fal main, vishesh rup se saadhaaran fal ek avar andashay se viksit hote hai, pushp ke anya bhaag jaise pushp nalika, dal, bahyadal or punkesar ke andashay ke saath jud kar isi ke saath pakate hai
 The hormone ethylene causes maturation
 jab pushp ke anya bhaag is tarah fal kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa banate hai, tab fal ko sahaayak fal kaha jaataa he
 Because other parts of the flower can contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study the structure of the flower to understand how it develops into a fruit
 falon kii vividhta ke dekhte huye sabhi gyaat falon ke liye kisi ek vargeekaran yojana kaa bananaa bahut kathin he
 Many common words for seeds and fruits are used incorrectly which can make it difficult to understand its terminology
 beej paripakv bijand hai, fal paripakv andashay hai jiname beej shaamil hai
 An explanation can also be added to these two basic definitions that a kernel in botanical terminology is neither a type of a fruit nor a seed, unlike the common terminology
 fal ke teen buniyadi prakaar hai: saadhaaran fal, guchchhedaar fal or bahukhandit fal
 a simple or mixed ovary containing only one stamens produces a simple fruit which may be dry or pulp
 sookhe mewa pakane par yaa sphotak yaa asphotak ho sakate hai
 Examples of dried and common fruits are: Those fruits in which some part of the fruit wall or the entire wall becomes fleshy on the boil are called normal pulp fruits
 yah fal ek hi pushp jisame kai saadhaaran punkesar ho, se viksit hote hai
 An example of this is raspberry
 ek bahukhandit fal, phulon ke ek samooh se gathit hota he
 Each flower forms a fruit but it all matures as a single mass
 inke udhaaharan hai, ananas, khaadya anjir, shahatut, osaj-santare or rotifal

 kuch prajatiyon main, bijaviheenta parthenocarpi kaa parinaam hoti he, jahaan fal bina nishechan prakriya ke hi gathit hota he
 Parthenocarpic fruits are fruits that can be formed even without pollination
 adhikansh bijrahit khattey falon ko paragan prerana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jabaki kele or annaas ko bilkul nahin
 Changes in the structure of fruits mainly depend on the way their seeds are propagated
 yah prasar pashuon, hawa, pani, yaa visphoti sfooton dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Fibers, water and vitamin c are usually present in good amount in fruits
 falon me kai padparasayan bhi hote hai jinaki adhiktar poshan tathyatalikaon ke antargat RDA / RDI listing nahin hoti he or anusandhan bataate hai ki yah koshikaon ko ek lambey-samay tak swasth rakhane or bimariyon kii rokthaam ke liye aavashyak hai

 In exchange for trading or exchange of the underlying asset itself, the derivative traders enter into an agreement to exchange cash or assets based on the underlying asset from time to time
 bhavi anubandh, iskaa ek saadhaaran udhaaharan he, jo ek aisa samjhauta he jiske aadhaar par kisi bhavi tithi main antarnihit parisampatti kaa vinimay kiya jaataa he
 Derivatives are often highly leveraged, so that even a small movement in the underlying price can cause a very large difference in the price of the derivative
 yadi antarnihit parisampatti ke keemat main thik vaisaa hi parivartan aata he jaisaa ki niveshkon kaa anumaan he to isamen hone vaale laabh kaa anumaan lagane or isse laabh kamaane ke liye niveshkon dwaara vyutpaadan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Alternatively, traders can use derivatives to hedge or reduce the risk of the underlying asset, and for this they enter into a derivative contract whose price moves in the opposite direction to its underlying position and its Cancels some or all of the part
 vyutpaadan ko saamanytah vyapak rup se nimna dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: a derivative is a contract whose origins are derived from an underlying asset
 kai saamanyat upyog me aanevaale yantro ko derevatives kaha ja saktaa he kyonki, ve apana mul kisi sampatti se nikaalte he
 For example, equity shares are themselves derivatives because they derive from their underlying underlying equity
 isi prakaar koi apane ghar ke liye beemaa letaa he jisase wo ghar ke sabhi jokhim se bachaa sake
 Derivatives are based on all major financial instruments that are explicitly sold in equities, debt instruments, foreign exchange, etc
 is prakaar jab ham derevatives ke bare me baat karte he, to hamaara aksar matlab vittiya derevatives se hota he
 There are various types of derivatives like forwards, futures, options and swaps
 adhikansh derevatives over-da-counter yaa bombai stock exange ke rup me ek exange par khride-beche jate he
 Derivatives are one of the three major categories of financial instruments and the other two shares and debt

 derevatives upree upkarnon me se kisi ek kaa upjog karke yaa, do yaa do se adhik upkarnon kaa ek sangyojan kaa upyog karke upyogkartaaon kii vibhinn aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye is tarah se taiyaar kiya ja saktaa
 2
 Derivatives can be traded on the basis of expectations about the future price movements of the underlying assets
 3
 ve sabhi band balanceshit upkarnon he
 4
 They can be used as a tool to reduce the risk of fluctuations in asset values
 mahatvapurn vittiya derevatives is prakaar he:- 1
 Forwards 2
 futures 3
 Options 4
 swaps Forwards is the oldest and first of all derivatives
 ek forward anubandh do pakshon ke bich ek samjhauta par ek purv nirdhaarit keemat par bhavishya me ek nishchit tithi par nakadi ke liye ek parisampatti ke ek sahmati maatra kaa aadan pradaan karne ke liye sanderbhit karata he
 The promised asset can be currency, commodities, instruments, etc
 udhaaharan:-1 june ko x ek samajhote par kapaas kii 50 ganthe ko Y, ek kapaas vyapaaree se gathree prati 1000 rupaye ke str par 1 disambar ko kharidta he
 This is a contract where x pays Rs 5 xxrep 4 0 for y on 1 December and y sells 50 bales of cotton to X
 ek forward anubandh me, ek upyogkarta, jo ek nishchit bhavishya kii tarik me ek sahmati mulya par nirdisht sampatti kharidne ke liye vaada karata he wo ‘lambey sthiti’ me hona kaha jaataa he
 On the other hand, a user who promises to sell in a future date at an agreed price is said to be in a 'short position'
 futures anubandh yah he jaha kuch bhavishya kii taarikh me nakadi ke liye kisi bhi sampatti yaa mudra yaa vastu vinimay karne ke liye, ek sahmati mulya par do pakshon ke bich ek samjhauta hota he
 In order to make both contracts the parties must have mutual trust with each other
 yah keval sangathit bhavishya ke bazaar main jagah letaa he
 Types of Futures: - futures do prakaar main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 1
 Commodity Futures 2
 vittiya futures The option contract gives the buyer an option to ring the purchase or underlying asset at a predetermined price before or on a future date
 keemat jo purv nirdhaarit he use ‘hadtaal mulya’ yaa ‘vyaayaam keemat’ kaha jaataa he
 Type of option: - vikalp do prakaar main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 1
 Put Options 2
 dabl vikalp Put option: - This is an option that gives the option holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a pre-determined price before the due date
 dabl vikalp:- yah ek aisa vikalp he jisame vikalp dharak ko bhavishya me ek nirdhaarit tithi se pehle ek purv nirdhaarit mulya par ek anternihit parisampatti ko kharidne yaa bechney ke liye aadhikar detaa he
 Swap is the exchange of financial instruments of two parties through a derivative contract
 yah us baat ke liye bazaar yaa to mudra bazaar yaa byaaj dar bazaar main utaar chadhaav yaa kisi anya bazaar se utpann hone vaale laabh lene ke liye vyavastha kii he
 Avoidance is a technique designed to eliminate or reduce risk
 vyutpaadan ke madhyam se antarnihit parisampatti kii keemat se sambandhit jokhim ko ek paksh se duusare paksh ko hastantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a farmer cultivating wheat and a milling farmer can sign a future contract to exchange a specified cash amount for a specified quantity of wheat in the future
 donon pakshon ne bhavi jokhim ko kam kar diya he: gehun kii kheti karne vaale kisaan ne keemat kii anischitata ke or miller ne gehun kii uplabdhta ke jokhim ko kam kar diya he
 However, there is still a risk because the events in the contract, such as the weather, are not fixed, which may cause wheat to be unavailable or that one of the parties may withdraw from the terms of the contract
 Although there is a third party called a clearing house to protect this future contract, not all derivatives are protected against counterparty risk
 duusare drushtikon se, kisaan or miller donon ek jokhim ko kam karte hai or ek jokhim kaa uparjan karte hai jab ve bhavi anubandh par hastakshar karte hai: kisaan is jokhim ko kam karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se kam hoga or is jokhim kaa uparjan karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se adhik hoga 
 duusari taraf, miller is jokhim kaa uparjan karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se kam hoga or jokhim ko kam karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se adhik hoga
 In this sense, one party is the insurer for one type of risk and the counterparty is the insurer for the other type of risk
 bachaav tab bhi hota he jab koi vyakti yaa sanstha ek parisampatti kharidta he or ek bhavi anubandh kaa prayog karke ise bechata he
 The person or entity has the right over this asset for a specified time and can then sell it at a specified price in future as per future contract
 beshak, isse vyakti yaa sanstha ko parisampatti ke adhikaar kaa laabh praapt hota he jabaki is baat kaa jokhim kam ho jaataa he ki bhavi vikray keemat apratyaashit rup se parisampatti ke bhavi keemat ke prati bazaar ke maujuuda keemtankan se vichlit hoga
 Derivation serves a legitimate business purpose
 udhaahranswaroop ek nigam ek vishesh byaaj dar par dhan kii ek badi rakam udhaar letaa he
 The loan interest rate is reset every six months
 nigam ko is baat kii chintaa he ki byaaj-dar chah maheenon main bahut adhik ho saktaa he
 The corporation may purchase a forward rate agreement
 agrasar dar samjhauta, paise kii ek kaalpanik raashi par kharidari karne ke baad chah maheenon tak ek nirdhaarit byaaj-dar ke bhugtan kaa ek anubandh he
 If after six months the interest rate exceeds the contracted rate, the seller, corporation or FRA pays the difference to the buyer
 yadi dar kam ho to nigam, vikreta ko is antar kaa bhugtan karegaa
 The purchase of FRA will serve to reduce uncertainty related to rate increase and keep earnings stable
 jokhim ko bimaakrit karne yaa usase bachaav karne kii apeksha jokhim kaa uparjan karne ke liye vyutpaadan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus, some individuals and entities will enter into a derivative contract to bet on the price of the underlying asset and bet that the party seeking insurance about the future asset's future price will prove to be wrong
 sattebaaz, ek vyutpaadan anubandh ke anusaar kam keemat par bhavishya main ek parisampatti ko kharidne main samarth hona chahenge jab bhavi bazaar keemat adhik ho yaa ek vyutpaadan anubandh ke anusaar adhik keemat par bhavishya main ek parisampatti ko bechnaa chahenge jab bhavi bazaar keemat kam ho
 Individuals and institutions may also be exposed to arbitrage opportunities when the current purchase price of an asset is lower than the price specified in a future contract to sell the asset

 vyapak taur par kaha jaataa he ki vyutpaadan anubandhon ke do suspasht samooh hai jo bazaar main vyapaar kiye jane ke tareeke ke anusaar ek-duusare se bhinn hai: The main three classes of derivation are: in buniyadi prakaar ke tatwon ke sangyojan dwaara adhik jatil vyutpaadan kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the holder of a swaption has the right, and not the obligation, to enter the swap on or before a specified future date
 samgr vyutpaadan bazaar main antarnihit parisampatti ke paanch pramukh varg hai: Some common examples of these derivatives are: antarnihit vinimayogy ke anya udhaaharan hai: Payment between parties can be determined by: kuch vyutpaadan, ek purv-nirdhaarit keemat ke liye bhavishya main kisi samay antarnihit pratibhuti yaa camodity ko kharidne yaa bechney ke adhikaar hai
 If the price of the underlying security or commodity moves in the right direction, the owner of the derivative makes money, otherwise his money is lost or the derivative becomes worthless
 anubandh ke niyamon par nirbhar hone ke kaaran, ek vyutpaadan kaa sambhavit laabh yaa haani apekshaakrit adhik ho saktaa he jitna antarnihit pratibhuti yaa camodity ko pratyaksh rup se vyapaar main lagane par hota
 There are two common measurements of price: vinimay-vyapaar vyutpadanon ke liye bazaar keemat aamtaur par paardarshee hota he 
haalanki OTC yaa fler-vyapaar anubandhon ke saath jatiltaayen paidaa ho sakati hai kyonki vyapaar ko apane haathon se sambhala jaataa he jo keemton ke swatah prasaarit hone ke liye ise kathin bana detaa hai
 Especially with OTC contracts, there is no special exchange for mixing and disseminating prices
 ek vyutpaadan anubandh ke liye antarpanan-mukt keemat jatil hota he or is par vichaar karne ke liye isamen kai alag-alag parivartaneey hote hai

 Derivatives can often face the following criticisms: vyutpaadan ke prayog ke parinamswaroop bahut badi haani kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he kyonki isamen uttolan yaa udhaar kaa prayog hota he
 With the help of derivatives, investors can get higher returns from the slightest movement in the price of the underlying asset
 haalanki, niveshkon ko bahut badi raashi kaa nuksaan bhi ho saktaa tha yadi antarnihit parisampatti kii keemat main unke khilaaf gati hota
 There are many examples of huge losses in derivatives markets, such as: vyutpaadan bazaaron ko viniyamit karne ke prayaas ko nasht karne or is tarah fol 2008 main vittiya bazaaron ke patan main sahaayak hone ke liye vittiya bazaar ke raashtrapati clinton ke karmi dal ke sadasyon: laire samars, alen greenspan, arthur leavit or robert rubin kii aalochana kii gai he
 President George W
 Bush has also been condemned because he was president for 8 years before the 2008 recession and did nothing to regulate derivative trade
 bush ne kaha he ki viniman, unke raajnneetik darshan ke mul siddhanton main se ek tha
 Derivatives expose investors to counterparty risk
 udhaahranswaroop, maane len ki ek vyakti apane vyavsaay ke liye ek nishchit byaaj dar par rin lenaa chahta he lekin jab use is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki bank keval parivartaneey daron par rin pradaan karte hai or kisi duusare vyavsaay kii sahaayta se gamagam bhugtan kii suvidha pradaan karte hai jiske liye ve avastavik rup se vyakti ke liye nishchit dar kaa nirmaan karte hai
 However, if the second business goes bankrupt, it cannot disclose its variable rate and therefore the first business will lose its fixed rate facility and start paying again at the variable rate
 yadi byaaj dar main vruddhi ho gai ho, to sambhav he ki pehla vyavsaay par pratikul prabhaav pad saktaa he kyonki ho saktaa he ki yah ucch parivartaneey dar ke bhugtan ke liye taiyaar na ho
 Different types of derivatives thus carry different levels of risk
 udhaahranswaroop, kaanoon ke nusaar manakikrut stock vikalp ke liye paksh ko jokhim uthaane ke liye exange ke saath kuch nishchit raashi jamaa kerani padati he jo yah darshata he ki ve kisi bhi haani kii sthiti main bhugtan kar sakate hai; jo bank rin par nishchit daron ke liye vyavsaay gamagam parivartaneey main madad karte hai, ve donon pakshon kaa credit check kar sakate hai
 However, private agreements established between two companies, for example, may not have criteria for performing loan enterprises and risk analysis
 vyutpaadan laghu yaa anubhavheen niveshkon ke liye anuchit atyadhik jokhim raashi khadaa kar dete hai
 Since derivatives offer more profit potential, they also provide an attraction for individual investors
 haalanki, vyutpaadan nihit sattebaazi main khaas taur par chote niveshak ke liye, aksar bahut adhik jokhim kii kalpana kii jaati he or jisamen anuroop anubhav or bazaar gyaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo is baat kaa kaaran he ki kyon kuch vittiya yojanakaar in prapatron ke prayog ke viruddh salaah dete hai
 Derivatives are complex forms created as a type of insurance that transfers risk between parties based on their desire to assume additional risk or avoidance
 vyutpaadan vyapak taur par ek arthvyavastha main rin kaa uttolan karte hai, antarnihit vaastavik arthvyavastha ko apane rin dayitvon kaa seva pradaan karne main or adhik pareshaan paidaa kar dete hai, is tarah vaastavik aarthik gatividhiyon main katautee kar dete hai jiske falswaroop mandi yaa yahaan tak ki niraashaa bhi ho sakati he

 Puritanism or consequentialism or pragmatism is a synonym for "pragmatism" in English and Pragmatism is derived from the Greek word 'pragma', meaning "verb" or "karma"

 Purposeism is a new philosophical ideology

 Realism is an ideology that was planted in the human mind in very ancient times
 yatharthwaad kisi ek sugathit darshanik vichaardhaara kaa naam na hokar un sabhi vichaaron kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo yah maanate hai ki vastu kaa astitv swatantra rup se he
 The idealist believes that the existence of the 'object' depends on our knowledge
 yadi yah vichaar sahi he to vastu kii koi sthiti nahin he
 On the contrary, realists believe that the object has independent existence whether it is in our thoughts or not
 vastu tathaa usase sambandhit gyaan donon pruthak-pruthak sattaayen he
 There are many things in the world that we do not know about, but this does not mean that they do not exist at all
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki vastu kii swatantra sthiti he
 Our knowledge makes us aware of his condition, but our knowledge about him does not destroy his existence
 vaise gyaan prapti ke saadhan ke vishay main yathartwaadee, prayojanavaad ke samaan vaigyanik vidhi ko hi sarvottam vidhi maanata he or nigaman vidhi kaa aashray letaa he
 It cannot be said with certainty when the purposeist ideology was born, but still keeping in mind the uniqueness of this ideology, it can definitely be said that since man caused his problems and difficulties and their solutions
 Started thinking about the truth and practicality of the experiences gained from the efforts made for this, since then this ideology has been planted

 Dr
 Schiller has proposed a theory called Humanitarianism which should really be considered a branch of consequentialism
 james kii to praaia: sabhi kritiyaan is vichaardhaara par aadhaarit hai
 James was often a staunch opponent of spiritualism, especially Hegelian spiritualism
 unhen prayogpriy evam bahyavastuvaadi amareeki janata kaa vaicharik pratinidhi kahana anuchit na hoga
 When he was engaged in the idea of a criterion of truth that was entirely different from the metaphysical paradigm, he wrote "how do we make our ideas clear" in an American monthly paper called "pupular Science" in January, 1878
 - Read the article and after finding the basic framework of modern consequentialism, he became convinced that this is the criterion of truth or truth
 peers ko, jaisaa swayan unhone hi kaha he, falanumeyapramanyawad kaa sabhanarthvachi "pregametism" shabd or uskaa bhav donon hi germany ke suprasiddh darshanik kaant kii kritiyon se mili the
 But even while showing the antiquity of this ideology, James considers himself especially grateful to Peers and has honored him as a pioneer of modern consequentialism in philosophy
 jo bhi ho, is siddhant ko bal evam prakhyati pradaan karne main swayan james kaa hi naam sarvopar ullekhneey he
 All the well-known texts such as his "principles of Psychology", "miscellaneous Forms of Religious Experience", "consequentialism", "meaning of Truth" and "the Nine World" support this ideology
 unke na keval taarkik vichaar hi kintu manovaigyanik evam tathvik-sabhi prakaar ke vichaar falanumeyapramanyawaadee pravriti ke suspasht pratik hai
 According to James "truth is the name of all things that prove themselves superior in the way of faith, and also for certain specific things"
 sankshep main, "satya vichaar kii prakriya kaa ek yogya yaa uchit upkaran maatr hota he, thik vaise hi jaise "shubh" hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan kaa ek safal saadhan maatr; vah kisi bhi prakaar se laabhprad or, vastut:, antatogatva tathaa sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhane par laabhadaayak he
 "james considers truth to be the cash value of our personal perceptions, not objective facts
 unke anusaar ham swayan apane satyon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 They are not merely reactions of external objects; But the seekers of our purposes are our only faith
 ham un vishwaason ko jo hamen bhavatmak tripti yaa vyaavhaarik safalataa pradaan karte hai satya maanane lagate hai, or iske vipareet parinamawaalon ko asaty
 Therefore, the veracity of our beliefs or thoughts is permissible by their result or result
 uske sthapit hone ke liye samay or anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Just as we get success in behavior with a belief, so also its truth increases
 hamaare simit anubhav dwaara pramanit hamaari kisi bhi aasthaa ko purnataya satya kahalaane kaa adhikaar nahin, yahan tak ki vigyaan ke tathakthith prakritik niyamon ko bhi purna rup se satya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We have the right to say as much as possible that as far as our experiences are concerned, they have proved to be true; But this does not prove their eternal truth
 purna satya ke liye purna anubhav, jiskaa hona kabhi sambhav nahin, apekshit he
 Therefore, any truth propounded by humans, whether it is scientific or whether it is scientific or logical, cannot be absolute truth
 jinhen praaia: manushya siddh-satya yaa siddhant sajaate hai unhen falanumeyapramanyawaadee keval upakalpana hi maanate hai
 They strongly criticize rationalist logic and corrupt their principles of justice
 ve maanviya vichaaron ko, buddhivaadee tarkshastriyon kii manyata ke viruddh, sadaiv prayojnatmak maanate hai, ni:swaarth nahin
 The Indian method of testing the truthfulness of knowledge called "tendency, strength and tendencyism", according to which the successor knowledge is considered to be true or false knowledge is inexact or false when it comes into action, resembling this consequential phenomenological method
 parantu, saath hi saath, "tadvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan yathartham" evam tadbhaavvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan bhram:" kahanevaala kattar vastuvaadi nyaayadarshan anurupatavaad kaa samarthak prathit hota he, jab ki james aadi paashchaatya falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ne uski katu aalochana kii he
 Just as in Satyasatya deliberation, similarly in the interpretation of mental processes or ideas, the consequentialist primevalists give a major place to our practical actions
 unke anusaar, ham na keval apane satyon kaa hi kintu vividh anubhavon kaa bhi nirmaan karte hai
 Our primary or basic experience is like an uninterrupted stream and we divide it into various substances and their interrelationships, inspired by self-interest and self-interest, through our mental actions of analyzing and choosing, etc

 Atomicist psychology is an imitation of the physical science of the same name, which is far from the reality and misleading in the eyes of the consequentialists
 vishwaason yaa vichaaron ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan main falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi sweekaar karanevaalon main tatvagyan sambandhi mataiky nahin
 Nevertheless, if any philosophy can be said to be a counterpoint to this ideology, it is the doctrinal principle propounded by Dr
 Schiller in the book "studies in Humanism", supported by Prof
 Dui
 iske anusaar, ham swayan hi sadaiv ek badi had tak or sahi arth main vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality continues to form, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge related to it
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa sambandh he yah nishchay he ki uskaa swaroop nirman, ek atyant mahatvapurn ansh main, hamaar or hamaare us gyaan ke upar nirbhar rahata he jisapar hamaare prayojanon or swaarthon kii chhap anivaaryat lagi rahati he
 Our facts are those in which their Nirmapika have the power or ability to satisfy our desires
 jis prakaar satya hamaare safal vishwaas hote hai usee prakaar tathy hamaari ichchhaaon ko santushti pradaan karanevaale padaarth hote hai
 In short, successful functional effectiveness in our practical life should be understood, according to these thinkers, as a sign of fact or reality
 bhartiya buddha darshan kii sat kii paribhaasha bhi, jiske anusaar "sat vah he jisamen kisi kaary ko utpann karne kii kshamta ho", falanumeyapramanyawaadee vichaardhaara ke anukool prathit hoti he, kyonki usamen bhi vastuon ke sattvaasatva, astitv, anstitv, ke nirdhaaran main unke kaaryrup fal ko hi nirnaayak mana he
 But in many other philosophical matters, all Buddhist philosophers neither agree with each other nor with the modern philanthropist
 ek maanavtaavaadi darshan hone ke kaaran prayojanavaad sansar evam uski vastuon tathaa kriyaaon ke kaarnon par us gambhirtha se vichaar nahin karata jitna maanav jivan main uski upyogita par vichaar karata he
 In order to protect its existence as an independent philosophy, Purposeism has laid down the following basic principles, considering the reasons of the world and its actions, making human the basis
 atah spasht he ki prayojanavaadee kabhi adarshavaadiyon kaa samarthan karte hai to kabhi prakrutivaadiyon kaa
 In this way, they place themselves between these two 'vados'
 prayojanavaadee darshan ‘pragati gami shiksha’ ke aandolan ke rup main prasphutit hua parantu aaj uski safalataa ke sambandh main anek ashankayein uthaai ja rahi hai
 The reason is clear that Purposeism has shown to be an incomplete ideology by its uncertain objectives, by giving more importance to the instrument and by rendering principles like creativity in the field of human values
 prayojanavaadee darshan ke sambandh main kuch vichaarneey bindu is prakaar hai – Due to the soft education system, children are not prepared to live real life

 Important Early Books dwitiyak strot Journals There are several peer-reviewed journals dedicated to pragmatism, for example aanaline strot The ratio between reality and its representation is called scale

 Scale on a map means the ratio of distances between two points shown on the map and their corresponding surface locations
 saanchaa:is lekh kii vartanee thik karne kii aavashyaktaa he The scale is the ratio of the actual distance between any two points on the plane and the distance between the same two points on the map
 saral shabdon m kaha ja saktaa he k dharaatal va maanach k dooray ke anupaat ko maapak kehete ha
 For example, the actual distance between two places on the ground is 1 km
 1 cm in the map
 m If shown by 1 m = 1 km There will be a scale of that map

 Decade Bhan method: This is a regulatory measure in which the measure is shown as a Bhan

 The value of the numerator is always 1 unit, for example, if a decade of a map is 1 / 100, 000, one unit of the map is equal to 100,000 units of the ground

 bhargav itihaas main bhargav vansh ke aadi pravartak maharishi bhrigu ke kaal se lekar san 1773 ke ant tak kaa sankshipt vivaran prastut he
 It is clear from the Rigveda and the later Vedic literature that there was no bonding of caste among the Aryans
 ve sab apane ko ek hi jati kaa maanate the
 But just as in western countries like England, the people community is considered divided into three classes, similarly in the Vedic period, there were three classes among the Aayas
 yajna havan karne karaane vaale brahman kehalaate the, jin main mantron ke rachayita rishi pad praapt karte the
 The king and his brother were called sons Kshatriyas
 shesh sab arya vish kehalaate the jiskaa arth saadhaaran jan he
 Whether the village head and farmer, what soldier and what cowherd, carpenter and weaver were all considered in this class
 brahmanon ke aaj jitne gotra paye jate hai ve sab vaidic kaal ke saat mul vanshon kii hi shakha-prashakha hai
 These seven clans are Bhargava, Angiras, Atreya, Kashyapa, Vasistha, Agastya and Kaushik
 inamen sabase pracheen bhargav, aatreya or kaashyap hai jinke pravartak bhrigu, atri or kaashyap naamak rishi the, jo vaidic yug ke armbh main hue the or vaiwaswath manu ke samakaleen the
 Maharish Bhrigu was also known as Atharvan and Angiras because he was the promoter of fire activity
 isiilie inke vanshaj prarambh main bhargav or angiras donon naamon se prasiddh the
 But after some time a branch of Bhrigu dynasty took the form of an independent dynasty called Angiras, so the rest of the Bhargavas stopped calling themselves Angiras
 is prakaar angiras vansh kaa chauthe brahman vansh ke rup main udai hua
 a few centuries later a sage named Basistha introduced the Vasistha dynasty
 vasishtha ke hi bhai agastya ne agastya vansh kaa pravartan kiya
 His contemporaries were Vishwamitra, who was the first Rajput
 unhone brahman banakar ek naye vansh kaa pravartan kiya jo unke pitamah kushik ke naam par kowshik kahalaaya
 These seven dynasties were external marriages, that is, a man of any one dynasty could not marry a daughter of the same dynasty
 kaalaantar main bhargavon or agirason kii sankhya main vruddhi hone ke kaaran ve donon vansh do do ganon main vibhakt ho gayi
 Later, some Kshatriyas were merged in each of these two dynasties
 bhargavon main samay samay par chaar kshatriya sammilit hue or angirson main paanch kshatriya sammilit hue
 Therefore, in the Bhargavas there were six gana and seven gana among angiras
 shesh paanch vansh bhi baad main gana kahalaane lage
 Thus there were eighteen Ganas among the Brahmins
 prayek gana vahruy vivaahi ho gaya arthath ek gana kaa vyakti apane se bhinn gana main hi vivaah kar saktaa tha
 In the Bhrigu lineage, the first name comes from Bhrigu, who was the psyche son of Brahma
 inke vanshajon main bhrigu vaaruni hue jinke do putr chyavan tathaa kavi the
 The Bhargava dynasty came into force with both of them
 bhargav vansh prarambh main jin do ganon main vibhakt hua unamem se ek gana chyavan ke vanshaj apnwaan ke naam par apnwan kahalaaya or doosraa unheen ke vanshaj shunak ke naam par shaunak kahalaaya
 The most ancient of the Kshatriya origin of the Bhargavas is the Gana named Vainya or Pathraya
 vaidic kaal kii prarimbhak shatabdiyon main pruthu naamak ek atyant prasiddh raja hua tha jiske pita kaa naam wain tha
 Some of the descendants of this king became priests and got absorbed into the Bhargavas and their descendants became a separate group which came to be known as Vainya or Pathya
 shukracharya ko kavi kaha jaataa he
 The descendants of Shukracharya were the sages like Shaindilya Dank etc
 from whom Dakot Joshi became a Bhargava Brahmin
 doosraa The Kshatriya who joined the Bhargava dynasty was Mitrayu, the son of King Divodas
 mithrayu ke banshaj maitrey kahalaaye or unase maitrey gana kaa pravartan hua
 The third Kshatriya origin of the Bhargavas was called Vaitahavya or Yask
 yask ke dwaara hi bhargav vansh alankrita hua
 He composed a book called Nirukta
 parashuram ke shatru sahasrabahu ke praputra kaa naam vitahavy tha
 Some of his descendants became priests and got absorbed in the Bhargavas and his descendants started to be called Vaitahvya or Yask
 bhargavon kaa chauthaa kshatriya mul kaa gana vedavishvajyoti kehalaata he
 Its history is not known

 The Gana is called Vahivahivahi class, meaning a person of a Gana could not marry among themselves
 bhrigu kii adtisvin peedi main gritsamad kaa naam aata he
 Gritsamad was a contemporary of the famous king Dibodas
 ve ek vikhyath rishi the or rugveda ke dwitiya mandal ke sookt unheen ke rache hue hai
 The son of Gritsamad was named Kurm and one of the sages of his family was named Somahuti
 chyavan bade prasiddh rishi the
 He is married to Sukanya, daughter of King Shayati
 inke chyavaan tathaa vasan do putr the
 Chywan had a daughter named Sumedha and a son named Apnavan and Pramati
 sumedha kaa vivaah mahirsh kashyap ke pautra nidhrup se hua
 Apnavan is married to the daughter of King Nahusha and sister of Yayati
 apnwaan or pramati se bhriguvansh aage badha
 There was a sage named Ruru in the dynasty of Pramati
 ruru ke vanshaj shunak ne angiras vansh ke shaun hotra gotri gritsamad ko god le liya jiske falswaroop gritsamad shaunak ho gayi or unase shaunak gana pravartit hua
 In the dynasty of Apnavan the famous sage became the famous sage
 urv ke putr kaa naam richik tha
 Ritchik was married to Satyavati, sister of Mahish Vishwamitra, daughter of kanya-kubja king Gadhi
 richik or satyavati ke putr mahirsh jamadagni the
 Jamadagni was the nephew of Vishwamitra and the two Suktas in the Rigveda were composed by both
 bhargavon ke in chha: ganon main apnwan gana ke sadasyon kii sankhya sabase adhik thi
 Therefore, the Apvanavana Gana was divided into three sides, namely Vatsa, Bid and Arsitahana
 anya gana bhi paksh kahalaane lage
 In this way, the Bhargavas had eight sides
 prayek paksh bhi anek gotron main vibhajit ho gaya
 Sometimes gotras of the same name were also found in different sides, ganas or lineages
 udhaaharan ke liye gagrya gotra bhargavon or agirason donon main paaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, it used to be difficult to decide which dynasty or which caste a person with such a gotra is
 is uljhan ko dur karne ke liye prayek gotra ke saath pravaron kii vyavastha kii gai
 Pravar means superior
 jab kisi gotra kaa vyakti apane pravaron arthath shreshth purvajon ke naamon kaa bhi ullekh kar detaa he to koi uljhan nahin ho sakati
 The eight sides of the Bhargavas are as follows
 vatsa paksh ke pravar bhrigu, chyavan, apnwaan, urv or jagadagni hai
 The elders of the Vid Paksha are Bhrigu, Chyavan, Apnavan, Urva and Bid
 arshtishen paksh ke pravar bhrigu, chyavan, apnwaan arshtishen or anup hai
 The elders of Shaunak Paksha are Bhrigu, Shunhotra and Grittamad
 vainya paksh ke pravar bhrigu, wain or pruthu hai
 The selectors of Maitreya Paksha are Bhrigu, Vadhyashva and Divodas
 yask paksh ke pravar bhrigu, vitahavy or savetas hai
 The elders of Vedavishvajyoti Paksha are Bhrigu, Veda and Vishwa Jyoti
 jamadagni kaa vivaah ikshvaku vansh kii rajkumaari renuka se hua
 Jamadagni and Renuka had a son named Mahatejasvi Rama who became famous by the name Parashurama because of his penance against enemies
 parashuram ek mahaan rishi the or mahaan yoddha bhi
 They are mentioned in all the mythological books - also
 unhone jahaan sahasrabahu ko parajeet karke apni veerta kaa parichay diya vahiin rugveda ke dasham mandal ke 110 wein sookt kii rachana karke apni vidwata kaa parichay diya
 Influenced by these unusual qualities, later generations considered him to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu
 ham bhargavon ke vartmaan gotra do ganon main se nikle hai
 Bats, Kuts, Galavas and Vid are under Apnwan Gana
 shesh do arthath kashyapi or gagrya yask gana ke antargat hai
 At the beginning of this period, the disciples of Ved Vyas became famous Bhargava scholars named Veshampayan, who were the Acharyas of Yajurveda and who narrated the story of Mahabharata to King Janamejaya

 Maharish Bhrigu had done austerities in the Bharat Khand, that place is called Bhrigu Kshetra, which became ungodly and became 'bharoch'
 isamen nivas karne vaali sabhi jatiyaan bhargav kehalaati hai
 The dynasty that grew from Maharish Bhrigu was called Bhargava
 or jo usase alag the, ve bhargav kshatriya : bhargav vaisya aadi kehalaae
 Maharish Bhrigu had married a girl named Shree to Lord Vishnu
 us samay brahma ji ke sabhi putr, rishi evam brahman upasthit hue
 After marriage Shreeji said to Lord Vishnu - There are 12000 Brahmins in this area, who wish for Brahmapada, i will establish them and i will also install 36,000 Vaishyas
 or jo bhi itar jan honge ve bhi bhrigu kshetra main nivas karenge un sabaki apane-apane varnon main bhargav sangya hogi
 Lord Vishnu called 'evamastu'

 There is a great possibility of getting mention of Dushar Bhargava even before 16 years

 The residents of the same Dhosi are called Bhargav Dhusars
 iskaa pusht pramaan 18 shan ke uttararddh main rachit `guru bhakthi prakaash ́ naamak granth se miltaa he
 Due to geographical area being on the banks of the Badhusara river, it is due to the descent of Chyavan that the slayer called Vadhusar became extinct
 shanai:-shanai: dhoosar shabd ke `dha ́ ke sthaan main `dha ́ aa jane dhusar shabd isi prakaar ban gaya jis prakaar dhrist shabd se dheet ban gaya
 The name of Dhosi village is also akin to Vadhusari

 Even till the north medieval period, the noun settled in the area around the Vadusara river, its noun became either gray or gray

 History After the death of the famous Sher Shah Suri, his son Islam Khan assumed the throne
 unhone hemu kii prashaskeey kshamtaaon kaa bharpoor upyog kiya
 Hemu made a new beginning in Indian politics as Emperor Hemachandra - usne apane bhai jujhar raay ko ajmer kaa soobedaar governor banaaya evam apane bhanje ramaiya or bhattije mahipal raay ko sena main shaamil kar liya
 Hemu did not remove any Afghan officer from his post, it also increased confidence in the soldiers
 hemu ne apane alp shashan kaal main jis jatigat sauhaard or dharmik sahishnutaa kaa sutarapaat kiya, vah uski apurv dur-drushti kaa parichaayak he
 Akbar was only 13 at the time and Bairam Khan was his mentor and principal advisor
 tardi beg ke netritv main mogul sena kii dilli main haar or hemu kii vijay se bairam khan itnaa adhik aahat or vichlit tha ki usne akbar kii sahmati ke bagair tardi beg ko phaansi de di
 On 5 November 1556, a fierce battle took place in Panipat between the forces of Emperor Hemachandra and Akbar
 ek tir samraat hemachandra kii aankh ko chhedta hua sir tak chalaa gaya
 Hemachandra did not give up the arrow and pulled out the arrow, but in this effort the whole eye came out with the arrow
 aapane apane roomaal ko aankh par lagaakar kuch der ladaai kaa sanchaalan kiya, parantu sheeghra hi behosh hokar apane ``hawaii ́ ́ naamak hathi ke haude main gir pade
 Your Mahavat was driving you out of the battlefield that Mughal commander Ali Quli Khan went ahead to capture the `` Hawaiian '' elephant and managed to arrest the unconscious Hemu
 is prakaar durbhagyavash samraat hemachandra ek jeeta hua yuddh haar gayi or bharat ke antim hindu samraat hemachandra dhusar vansh kaa shashan 29 din ke baad samaapt ho gaya
 The incident was quite unexpected for Bairam Khan
 bairam khan ne akbar se prarthana kii ki hemu kaa vadh karke vah `gaji ́ kii padavi kaa haqadaar bane
 In a hurry, unconscious Hemu was beheaded
 jisase hemu ke samarthakon kii himmat yaa bhavishya ke vidroh kii sambhaavna ko puri tarah kuchal diya jaay
 After Delhi was captured, Bairam Khan decided to kill all the descendants of Hemu
 hemu ke samarthak afakhaan amir or samant yaa to maare gaye yaa phir dur-daraaj ke thikaanon kii taraf bhaag gaye
 On the instructions of Bairam Khan, his warlord Maulana Pir Mohammad Khan took Hemu's father captive and sliced his aged body with the sword
 or usne hemu ke samast vashdharon yani sampoorn dhusar bhargav kul ko nasht karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Bhargav people called Dhusars settled in the areas of Alwar, Rewari Narnaul, Aanod etc
 were selected and taken captive
 saath hi hemu ke atyant vishwaas paatr afagaan adhikariyon or sevakon ko bhi nahin baksha
 In celebration of his victory, he built a huge tower from the severed ends of all the captive Dussera Bhargavas and soldiers
 akbar ne ek farmaan ke zariye jab apana rosh prakat kiya to bairam khan ne akbar ke khilaaf baghawat kar di
 Akbar defeated and took him captive and granted him a pardon
 bairam khan ne apane paapon kaa praayshchit karne haj ke liye makka bheje jane kii darkhwaast pesh kii jise akbar ne manjuur kar liya
 But on the way, an Afghan named Mubarak Khan Lohani struck him with a sword and killed him
 akbar ke guptcharon ne samraat ko soochna di ki bhargav sampradaay kii auraton or chote bacchon ko chhodkar, puri tarah safaaya kar diya gaya he, keval ek dhusar bhargav shesh rah gaya he unka naam he sant navaldas! akbar ke aadesh ke anusaar sant navaldas ko pakadakar darbar main haazir kiya gaya or unhen karagaar main daal diya gaya
 Akbar had a change of heart after meeting Saint Nawaldas
 usne dhusar bhargavon par barason se ho rahe atyaacharon ko turant band karne kaa aadesh diya or hemachandra ke mrit bhattije mahipal ke chaar varshiya putr nathmal ko hemachandra kaa ekmaatr vanshaj samajhakar anaud ke vishaal kshetra kii jaagir saunpi or rajkosh se 11 hajaar mudraaen vaarshik rup se dene kaa shahi farmaan jari kiya, jo san-1857 tak maanya rahaa
 According to the historical facts obtained, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that in Indian politics, Hinduism was not a pioneer of Hindu unity or all-religion potential, but Hemachandra, whose army consisted of more than 90 percent Afghan Muslims
 dilachasp tathy yah he ki hemachandra ko samratatv unke sahyogi afagaan senadhikariyon evam prashaskon ne ekamat se diya tha
 The title of 'vikramaditya' was also conferred on him, he did not bear it himself
 gauratlab yah bhi he ki bihar ke anek kshetron main hemachandra se sambandhit loakgeet aaj tak prachlan main hai
 This fact underscores that Hemchandra was very popular among the common people and that the 'public welfare state' that is discussed today was Hemchandra Vikramaditya, the pioneer in medieval India
