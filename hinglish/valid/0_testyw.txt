 yah maan liya jaataa he ki sabhi form tarksangat nirnay-nirdhaaran kaa anusaran kar rahi hai or ve laabh ko adhiktam karne vaale output par utpaadan karenge
 is dharna ko dekhte hue, chaar shreniyon main ek form ke laabh par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In microeconomics, the term "market failure" does not mean that a given market has stopped functioning
 iske bajaay, bazaar kii vifaltaa ek sthiti he jisamen ek diya hua bazaar kushaltapurvak utpaadan sangathit nahin karata he yaa upabhoktaaon ko vasteen evam sevaayen aavantit nahin karata he
 Economists normally apply the term to situations where the first welfare theorem fails so that market outcomes are no longer within the limits of the Pareto
 duusari taraf, ek raajnneetik sandarbh main, hitdharak bazaar kii vifaltaa shabd kaa prayog un sthitiyon ko bataane ke liye kar sakate hai jahaan bazaar kii shaktiyaan janhit ko puraa nahin karaati hai
 There are four main types or causes of market failure: kisi gatividhi kii avasar laagat sarvshereshth agle purvanishchit vikalp ke baraabar hoti he
 Although the amount of opportunity cost is difficult to determine, the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real at the individual level
 vastav main, yah siddhant sabhi nirnyon ke liye lagu hota he, na ki keval aarthik siddhanton ke liye
 ioystreliyai arthshaastri freedrik won vijar ki rachana ke samay se, avasar laagat ko mulya ke seemaant siddhant kii neenv ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Opportunity cost is a method of measuring the cost of an item
 kisi pariyojna ke laagton kii sirf pahchaan karnaa yaa laagton ko jodne ke bajaay, koi vyakti samaan rupee kharch karne ke liye agle sarvshereshth vaikalpik tareeke kii bhi pahchaan kar saktaa he
 The advantage of this next best alternative method is the opportunity cost of the original choice
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ek kisaan he jo apni bhoomi ko padosiyon ko kiraye par dene, jisamen avasar laagat kiraye par dene se hone vaala purvanishchit laabh he, kii bajaay us par kheti karne kaa chunaav karata he
 In this situation, the farmer alone can hope to generate more profit
 isi prakaar se, vishvavidhyalay main pravesh lene kaa avasar laagat khoyi huyi mazdooree he, jise koi vidhyaarthee kaarybal ke dwaara arjeet kar saktaa tha, bajaay kii tution, pustakon or anya aavashyak vastuon kaa kharch he 
 bahama main kisi chuttee kii avasar laagat ek ghar ke liye tatkaal adaayagi kii rakam ho sakati he
 Note that opportunity cost is not the sum of available options, but rather the benefit of a single, best option
 shahar dwaara apni khaali jameen par aspataal kaa nirmaan karne ke nirnay kii sambhavit avasar laagat khel ke ek centre liye bhoomi kaa nuksaan, yaa parking ke liye bhoomi kaa upyog karne kii asamarthta, yaa rupaya jise bhoomi ko bech kar praapt kiya ja saktaa tha, yaa vibhinn anya sambhavit upyogon main se kisi ek kii haani - lekin samgr rup se sabhi nahin, he
 The right opportunity cost will be the pre-determined benefit from the most profitable item among those listed
 yahaan ek sawaal uthta he ki iske laabh kaa moolyankan karne ke liye tulana ko sahaj karne evam avasar laagat kaa moolyankan karne ke liye prayek vikalp se jude hue ek dollar mulya kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie, jo hamaare dwaara tulana kii jane vaali vastuon par nirbhar karte hue kamovesh kathin ho saktaa he
 For example, many decisions involve environmental impacts whose dollar value is difficult to evaluate due to scientific uncertainty
 ek maanav jivan yaa arctic main tel ke ek chhalkaav ke aarthik prabhaav ke moolyankan karne main naitik prabhaav ke saath vyaktiparak vikalp bananaa shaamil hota he
 It is important to understand that nothing is free
 koi kya karnaa chunata he, isse koi fark nahin padataa he, vah badale main hameshaa kuch chodta rahata he
 An example of opportunity cost is the decision between going to a concert and doing homework
 yadi koi vyakti ek sangeet kaarykram main jane kaa nirnay karata he, tab vah adhyayan ke bahumoolya samay ko kho rahaa he, lekin agar vah homework karnaa chunata he tab to laagat sangeet kaaryan ko chhod rahaa he
 Opportunity cost is important for understanding microeconomics and decisions made

 First of all, Muhammad Tughluq allocated the posts on the basis of merit without any discrimination
 nasl or varg-vibhed ko samaapt karke yogyata ke aadhaar par adhikariyon ko niyukt karne kii niti apanaayi
 In fact, it was the misfortune of that ruler that his plans were not executed successfully
 jiske kaaran yah itihaaskaaron kii aalochana kaa paatr bana
 While sitting on the throne of Muhammad Tughlaq, the Delhi Sultanate was divided into a total of 23 provinces, the main ones of which were Delhi, Devgiri, Lahore, Multan, Sarmuti, Gujarat, Awadh, Kannauj, Lakhnauti, Bihar, Malwa, Jajnagar, Dvarasamudra etc

 As a result, a new independent state was established in the south and these regions were separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal bhi swatantra ho gaya
 After the ascension, Muhammad Tughlaq tried to make some new plans and implement them
 jaise - Through his first plan, Muhammad Tughlaq increased the tax in the fertile region of Doab, but in the same year there was a severe famine in Doab, which affected the yield
 tululaq ke adhikariyon dwaara jabaran kar vasuulne se us kshetra main vidroh ho gaya, jisase tululaq kii yah yojana asafal rahi
 Muhammad Tughlaq established a new department called 'diwan-e-amir Kohi' for the development of agriculture
 sarkari karmchaariyon ke bhrashtachar, kisaanon kii udaseenta, bhoomi kaa acha na hona ityadi kaarnon se krishi unnati sambandhi apni yojana ko teen varsh pashchaat samaapt kar diya
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq provided loans to farmers at very low interest
 tululaq ne apni duusari yojana ke antargat rajdhani ko dilli se devgiri sthaanantarit kiya
 Devagiri was also called "kuvvatul Islam"
 sultan qutubuddin mubarak kilji ne devgiri kaa naam 'qutubabad' rakhaa tha or mohammad bin tululaq ne iskaa naam badalakar daulatabad kar diya
 The Sultan was most criticized for this plan
 mohammad tululaq dwaara rajdhani parivartan ke kaarnon par itihaaskaaron main bada vivaad he, phir bhi nishkarshtah kaha ja saktaa he ki, devgiri kaa dilli sultanate ke madhya sthit hona, mongol akramanakariyon ke bhay se surakshit rahanaa, dakshin-bharat kii sampannataa kii ore khinchaav aadi aise kaaran the, jinke kaaran sultan ne rajdhani parivartit karne kii baat sochi
 This plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed completely and he allowed people from Daulatabad to return to Delhi in 1335 AD

 sankethik mudra ke antargat sultan ne sambhawatah pital or tamba dhaatuon ke sikke chalaaye, jiskaa mulya chaandi ke rupee taka ke baraabar hota tha
 Due to lack of state control over coinage, many fake mints were made

 The Sultan suffered terrible financial losses on the failure of his plan
 chauthi yojana ke antargat mohammad tululaq ke khurasaan evam karachil vijay abhiyaan kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 In order to conquer Khorasan, Muhammad Tughlaq gave a salary of one year in advance to a large army of 3,70,000 soldiers, but due to political change the two countries reached a compromise, which failed the Sultan's plan and financially hurt him
 Had to lift
 karachil abhiyaan ke antargat sultan ne khusro malik ke netritv main ek vishaal sena ko pahari rajyon ko jeetne ke liye bheja
 His entire army wandered in the wild paths, according to Ibn Battuta, ultimately only ten officers could survive and return
 is prakaar mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi asafal rahi
 Probably between 1328-29 AD, the Mongol invader Tarmasharin Chagtai invaded India with a huge army and trampled the territories from Multan, Lahore to Delhi
 aisa mana jaataa he ki, sultan mohammad tululaq ne mongol netaa ko ghoose dekar waapas kar diya tha ye bhi smbhv he ki mongol netaa ne sultan ko dilli sltant ko khud hi ythasthiti kamazor karne va isi tarah mongol shasn ke liye zmin tyaar karne ke liye ghoose di
 Whatever happened between them, the Sultan was subjected to criticism due to this compromise policy towards the Mongol leader
 ye sahi he ki iske baad phir kabhi mohammad tululaq ke samay main bharat par mongol akraman nahin hua or ye bhi ki apni mahattvakankshi asafal yojanaon ke kaaran mohammad tululaq ko ‘asafalataaon kaa badshaah’ kaha jaataa he
 Most revolts took place during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, of which 27 revolts took place in South India alone
