 The eastern and western parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911 due to pressure from the Indian people on both sides due to high level political unrest caused by this division

 On the same occasion, its Chairman Mr
 Lalmohan Ghosh, in his address criticized the reactionary policy of the government, reported imminent mutilation on an all-india platform
 unhone kaha ki is prakaar kaa ek shadyantr chal rahaa he
 The government officially published the idea in January of 1904 and in February Lord Curzon made official visits to assess the public opinion on the partition in the eastern districts of Bengal
 unhone pramukh hastiyon ke saath paraamarsh kiya or dhaka, chatgaanv tathaa maimansingh main bhaashan dekar vibhaajan par sarkaar ke rukh ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya

 In those days Bengal province also included Bihar and Orissa

 The then Viceroy and Governor General Lord Curzon tried to convince the people in the Land Holders Association or Zamindar Sabha that vangabhang would only benefit

 The then Nawab of Dhaka, reputed among the Muslims, also opposed it in the first charge

 The division was encouraged for administrative tasks, Bengal being almost as large as France, with a population much larger than France

 With the division of the province, better administration could be established in the eastern region, so that the people there would ultimately benefit from school and employment opportunities
 haalaanki, vibhaajan kii yojana ke peeche anya uddeshy bhi chhipe the
 Bengali Hindus were pioneers in the political movement for greater participation in governance, so now their position was weakened due to the increase in the dominance of the Muslims in the past
 Both Hindus and Muslims opposed the partition
 After partition, however, an almost anti-british movement prevailed at the national level, including non-violent and violent protests, boycotts and even the assassination of the governor of the new province of West Bengal

 He is said to have said openly in many places that Hindus and Muslims are his two bibis, of which Muslims are his favorites

 Vangabhang was not intended to facilitate administration, as it was claimed, but rather had two clear objectives, one to fight a Hindu Muslim and the other to hurt the newly awakened Bengal
 yadi gaharaai se dekha jaae to yaheen se pakistan kaa bijaropan hua
 One of the resolutions passed in the 1906 session of the Muslim League was also that vangabhang is good for Muslims and those who agitate against it do wrong things and they harm Muslims
 baad ko chalakar lig ke 1908 ke adhiveshan main bhi yah prastaav paarit hua ki congress ne vangbhang ke virodh kaa jo prastaav rakhaa he, vah sweekruti ke yogya nahin

 There was bloodshed in both the divisions of Bengal

 Muslims in East Bengal believed that a separate region would provide them more opportunities for education, employment, etc
, whereas the people of West Bengal did not like this partition and a large amount of nationalist literature was produced during this time
 bhartiya rashtriya congress dwaara kiye gaye virodh kaa netritv sar henry jon stedman coton ne kiya jo purv main assam ke mukhya ayukta the, parantu karzan adig rahe

 Kiratarjuniyam is an epic poem written by Mahakavi Bharavi in the seventh century AD, which is ranked in the 'vrhatatrayi' of the epics in Sanskrit literature
 mahabharat main varnit kiratveshi shiv ke saath arjuna ke yuddh kii laghu katha ko aadhaar banaakar kavi ne raajnneeti, dharmaniti, kootneeti, samaajanneeti, yudhniti, janajivan aadi kaa manoram varnan kiya he
 This poem is filled with various juices, but it is predominantly a heroic work
 sanskrit ke chha: prasiddh mahakavy hai – brihattrayee or laghutrayee
 Kiratarajanayiyam, Shishupalavadham and Nashidhacharitam - are called Brihattrayi
 kumarasambhavam, raghuvansham or meghdutam - laghutrayee kehalaate hai
 Kiratarajuniyam is the only available work of Bharvi, which paved the way for a Sangopang epic
 magh-jaise kaviyon ne usee kaa anugaman karte hue sanskrit sahitya bhandar ko is vidha se samrudh kiya or ise nai oonchaai pradaan kii
 The stream of the epic, which appears in Kalidasa's miniatures and Ashwaghosh's Buddhacharitam, notwithstanding its distinct qualities, does not have the poise and totality that Bharvi initiated
 sanskrit main kiratarjunium kii kam se kam 37 tikaayen hui hai, jinamein mallinath kii tikaa ghantapath sarvshereshth he
 In 1912 Karl Kappler translated German into Kirtarajuniyam under the Harvard Oriental Series
 angreji main bhi iske bhinn-bhinn bhaagon ke chha: se adhik anuwaad ho chuke hai
 Due to Bharvi's special tendency in politics and behavior-policy, it was only reasonable that he would pick up the story of Kiratarajuniyam from the Mahabharata
 unhone vanaparv ke paanch adhyyon se pandavon ke vanvaas ke samay amogh astr ke liye arjuna dwaara kii gai shiv kii ghor tapasya ke falswaroop pashupathastra praapt karne ke chote-se prasang ko uthaakar use atharah sargon ke is mahakavy kaa rup de diya
 When Yudhishthira lost everything in the Dutekrida with the Kauravas, he had to go on a 13-year exile with his brothers and Draupadi
 unka adhikansh samay dwaitvan main beetaa
 Draupadi used to inspire Yudhishthira often to prepare for war and to withdraw his kingship from the Kauravas through war, dismayed by the hardships of exile and remembering the plot by the Kauravas
 bhim bhi draupadi kii baton kaa paksh lete hai
 a forester sent to Hastinapur as an undercover informs that Duryodhana is involved in the all-round development and consolidation of his united kingdom, as he feared the Pandavas for half the kingdom he had dealt with fraud and gaming
 pandavon ko bhi lagata he ki vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone par unka aadha rajya bina yuddh ke waapas nahin milegaa
 Draupadi and Bhima provoke Yudhishthira to immediately attack Duryodhana, not waiting for the period of exile to end, but unwilling to take the limits of idealistic, unforgiving Yudhishthira behavior
 udhar aa nikle vyas salaah dete hai ki bhavishya ke yuddh ke liye pandavon ko abhi se shakti-sanvardhan karnaa chahie
 According to the remedy given by him, Arjuna walks towards the Indrakil mountain in the Himalayas under the guidance of a Yaksha to appease Indra for asceticism
 vahaan ek ashram banaakar kii gai tapasya ke falswaroop apsaraon aadi ko bhejkar pariksha lene ke baad indra ek vruddh muni ke vesh main upasthit hote hai or tapasya ke nashwan loukik lakshya ko nidhsaar bataate hue parmarth kii mahatta kaa nidarshan karte hai
 Arjuna satisfies Indra by presenting the account of the deceit and injustice done by the Kauravas in its cut, the imperative of retaliation from the enemy, social duty and retaliation for injustice
 falswaroop indra apane vaastavik rup main prakat hokar arjuna ko manorath-purti ke liye shiv kii tapasya karne kii salaah dete hai
 Arjuna again engages in severe, uninterrupted penance
 arjuna indrakil ke liye ek ajanabi tapasvi he, jataa, valkal or mrigcharm to uske paas hai lekin saath hi sharir main kavach bhi he, yagyopavit kii jagah pratyancha-samet gandiv dhanush he, do vishaal tarkas hai or ek uttam khadg bhi
 Considering it to be anti-sageism, the other ascetics there are terrorized and reach Shankar for request
 uske kram main shiv ji kiraaton kii sthaneey janajati ke senapati kaa vesh dharankar kiraatveshdhari apane ganon kii sena lekar arjuna ke paas pahunch jate hai
 That is why a demon named 'mook' considers Arjuna's penance to be the work of the gods, holding the body of a giant sucker, and then hurries to kill him
 shiv or arjuna donon dwaara ek saath chalaae gaye ek-jaise baan se us boar kii igalila samaapt ho jaati he
 Shiva's arrow gets pierced into the earth piercing his body and when Arjun goes to remove his arrow from his body, Shiva sends one of his Ganes to raise a dispute
 parinamtah donon ke bich yuddh armbh ho jaataa he
 Arjuna forces the army of the Ganas to run away with arrows but is defeated in the war with Shiva
 paraajay se hataash arjuna kiraat-senapati ke vesh main shiv ko pahachaanakar samarpan kar dete hai, jisase prasann hokar shiv prakat hote hai or pashupathastra pradaankar uskaa prashikshan dete hai
 In this way, with the completion of Arjuna's intention, all the intentions of the epic genre are proved
 kiraat veshdhari shiv ke is lokottar myth se itar is prasang kii apni ek vishisht janajaatiy abhivyanjana bhi he, jo is kavy ko vartmaan bhavabodh ke kareeb laati he
 The unwavering loyalty, indomitable boldness and high political understanding of Vancher in the dialogue between Yudhishthira and gupta-turned-vancher leaves no room for doubt in India's favor towards the forest dwellers
 vanechar shuru main hi spasht kar detaa he— In the beginning of this whole episode, some proverbs have been uttered by Bhima towards Yudhishthira in support of Draupadi's talk
 unheen main se ek neeche uddhrit he: Bharavi is known for his sense of pride - 'upma Kalidasasya Bhaverirthagaurvam'
 is arth-gaurav se mail khaati ek vidagdh bhashaa or abhivyakti-kaushal unki smapda he
 He has an extraordinary penetration in diverse dimensions of life, including politics and behavior
 adarsh or vyavhaar ke dwandv tathaa yatharth jivan ke atirekon ke samaahaar se arjeet santulan unke lekhan ko ‘samastalokaranjak’ banaata he
 But Bharvi is basically a poet of life's irony and discrepancies, confronting him and trying to reconcile between his rough reality
 kiratarjunium ke pehle sarg main draupadi or duusare main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ko duryodhana ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke liye uksaane or yudhisthir dwaara use anithipurna bataakar asweekaar kar dene ke kram main bharavi ne raajnneeti ke do chhoron ke bich ke dwandv par bahut sarthak vimarsh prastut kiya he
 Similarly, in the eleventh canto in the place of salvation, Indra's asceticism for power and sovereignty has been described as indescribable by Indra, as a response to Arjuna, Bharavi retaliated against injustice in life-practice, cosmic success, fame and self
 - The serious views given on the importance of respect, they present a picture of a balanced ideal of a healthy academic life
 bhashaa par apane apratim adhikaar ke chalate chitrakavy ke jis bhashik chamatkaar kii parampara bharavi ne shuru kii, unke baad ke kaviyon ke liye vah kasuti ban gai or magh main jaakar vah charmotkarsh par pahaunchi
 See the pictogram in the following lines

 Similarly, take the first letter of all the lines or take the last letter - 'devakani is found

 ek hi pad chaar baar aayaa he kintu arth bhinn-bhinn hai
 There are 18 cantos in Kiratarjuniyam
 kiratarjunium ke pehle sarg main draupadi or duusare main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ko duryodhana ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke liye uksaane or yudhisthir dwaara use anithipurna bataakar asweekaar kar dene ke kram main bharavi ne raajnneeti ke do chhoron ke bich ke dwandv par bahut sarthak vimarsh prastut kiya he
 In the third canto, Vyasa advises Bhishma, Drona, Karna-like men of the Kaurava side to invoke power in every way over a period of 13 years, describing them as invincible by the Pandavas, and to use them for preparing for a future war
 iske liye ve arjuna ko ucch koti ke shastrastra hetu tapasya se indra ko prasann karne ke liye prerit karte hai or apane saath laae ek yaksha ko bhi chhod jate hai jo arjuna ko indra kii tapasya ke liye upyukt sthaan tak le jayega
 In the fourth canto, there is a lively and interesting account of Arjuna's journey from Dvaitavan to the Himalayas under the guidance of the Yaksha, in which the euphoria and moderate nature of the autumn and the joy of the mixed life of the people is waved in many forms
 paanchavaan sarg yaksha ke saath arjuna ke yatra-prasang se giriraaj himalay ke parvatiy pradesh ke vishad, alankaarik varnan kii chata se deept he
 The theme of the sixth canto is: Indranil's unmatched beauty seen through Arjuna's eyes, Arjuna's initiation of penance, the various nature's contribution to asceticism, the deities stationed there, informing Indra by reaching Amaravati by Indra, Indra gives the Devangas their Go there with fellow Gandharvas and order to disturb Arjuna's penance with his gesture and beauty, so that his destruction Integrity can be tested
 saatven sarg main apsaraayen tathaa unke sahchar gandharv puure ullas-vilaas ke saath akaash maarg se vishesh prakaar ke haathiyon or rathon par savaar dev ganga ke kinare-kinare amravati se indrakil tak kii yatra karte hai
 After getting down near Indrakil, they make a divine camp like gandharva-nagari from their illusion on the majestic river Ganges
 aathvaan sarg main apsaraayen apane shiviron se van-vihaar ke liye nikalati hai
 From here, the color of Shringar Rasa begins to rise, which is thickened in the water sports described in this canto and reaches its culmination in the ninth canto, which is full of wine and drink
 dasavaan sarg apsaraon dwaara arjuna kaa dhyaan khinchakar use tapasya se chyut karne ke abhiyaan or uski asafalataa kaa he
 The eleventh canto depicts the arrival of Indra in the guise of the Veteran Muni and the futility of his worldly goal of penance, in response to which Arjuna makes his narrative of the values, priorities of cosmic life
 is sarg ke ant main arjuna ke tark se santusht devraj apane swaroop main prakat hokar uske lakshya ke anuroop shiv kii aradhana kaa upadesh dete hai
 In the twelfth canto, Arjuna starts austere penance, so that other saints get scared and go to Shankar
 shankar kiraat kaa vesh dharkar arjuna se milte hai
 In the thirteenth canto, both Arjuna and Kirat Rupadhari Shiva attack Sukar Rupdhari with arrows
 kiratarjunium ke antim paanch sarg apni gana-sena ke saath kiraatveshdhari shiv or arjuna ke bich yuddh ko samarpit hai
 In the 15th canto, in which this phase of the war comes, Bharvi has used Chitrakavya to introduce a new tradition within the realm of the epic
 kiratarjunium samalochakon ko atipriy he
 It has more than 42 commentaries
 navar eta jila ke aliganj prakhand ek gaanv he

 sankshep main gulab raay ji kaa bhashaa sanyat, gambhir or pravahpurn he
 In the works of Gulab Rai Ji, we see the following styles: 1
 vivechanaatmak style- yah style gulab raay ji ke aalochanatmak tathaa vichaaratmak nibandhon main milti he
 In this style, when considering literary and philosophical subjects seriously, the sentences become relatively long and inaccurate, but where current problems, interpretations of ancient theories or interpretive criticisms of poets are presented, the sentences are simple and expressive
 is style kaa ek udhaaharan- 'rashtriya parv' kaa manaanaa kori bhavukta nahin he
 This sentimentality has value
 bhavukta main sankramakata hoti he or phir shakti kaa sanchaar karti he
 Thoughts can illustrate our condition, but the strong motivation and power of the work is contained in the emotions
 2
 bhavatmak style- gulab raay ji kii is style main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa sundar samanvay he
 This style is impressive and enjoys a prose poem
 isaki bhashaa atyant saral he
 The sentences are short and Urdu words have also been used at some places
 'nar se narayan' naamak niabandh se is style kaa ek udhaaharan- 'sitambar ke maheene main agre main pani kii traahi-traahi machi thi
 i also kept Chari 'bow' in a nearby field to maintain Vaishya religion
 jowar kii pattiyaan anth-anth kar battiyaan ban gai thim
 3
 Humor and witty style - Gulab Rai ji has also put humor and satire in the description of serious themes to overcome the drabness of his essays
 is vishay main unhone likhaa he- 'ab main praayah gambhir vishyon main bhi hasya kaa samavesh karne laga hoon
 Where there is a possibility of loss of meaning due to humor or if there is a very compassionate context, then i will avoid humor, otherwise i welcome the past humor as much as the miser or any unintended money
 ' is style main hasya kaa samavesh karne ke liye gubaab raay ji yaa to muhaavaron kaa sahaara lete hai yaa shlesh kaa
 The sentences in this style are somewhat large
 isamen urdu, farsi ke shabdon or muhaavaron kaa bhi prayog hua he
 Gulabrai ji has composed many original texts as well as edited many texts
 unki kritiyaan is prakaar hai- Critical compositions - Navaras, Subodh history of Hindi literature Hindi, Natya discourse, Criticism Kusumjani, forms of poetry, theory and study etc

 He has demonstrated his talent and originality in both criticism and essay fields
 hindi main sarv pratham unhone hi darshan sambandhi nibandhon kii rachana kii
 Gulab Rai Ji's essays contain the message of morality, progress for society, modesty approach, the simplest interpretation of complex theories of philosophy and sublime sense of national love

 That is why i dedicated myself to the Sangh work

 saanchaa:magazine Business process outsourcing is a type of outsourcing process in which a third party service provider is assigned the operations and responsibilities of a specific business process
 Originally, this process was used by production companies such as Coca Cola, which used outsourcing for a large segment of its supply chain
 In the contemporary context, this process is mainly used for outsourcing services
 bipio aamtaur par ] shaamil he | BPO in which a company is contracted outside the country is called offshore outsourcing
 The BPO in which a company from a neighboring country is contracted is called Nearshore Outsourcing

9 billion and revenue from IT and entire BPO is USD 30 billion
 Thus India's share in the total BPO industry is some 5-6 percent, but the major share in the offshore component is 63 percent
 This 63 percent share is less than the previous year when India's offshore share was 70 percent
 While India has grown by 38 percent over the previous year, many other places such as Eastern Europe, Philippines, Morocco, Egypt and South Africa have taken stakes in the industry
 China is also trying to grow in this industry from a small base
 However, it is expected that the BPO industry will continue to grow in India but its offshore market share is expected to decline
 Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and New Delhi are important centers in India
 nascom ke anusaar varsh 2006-2007 main bharat main bipio niryaatkon kii sheersh paanch company ] daksh or tisies bipio he | According to mckinsey, the estimated value of the BPO market in the world is $ 122–154 billion, of which 35–40 share is retail banking, 25–35 insurance, 10–12 travel / hospitality, 10–12 autos, 8–10 telecommunications, 8 pharma
 , 10-15 others and 20-25 is part of finance, accounting and human resources
 In addition, they estimate that only 8 percent of the capacity was used in the year 2006
 == bipio laabh or simaaen a major advantage of BPO is that it helps a company grow in its ability to adapt to the situation
 However, many sources view this capability from a different perspective
 Hence business process outsourcing helps in making an organization transformative in various ways

 Key employees can be used to work with more time and energy in the core business of the company by retiring from unnecessary or administrative processes
 The key is to know what the main task to focus on - customer intimacy, product leadership or operational excellence
 Focusing more on one of these tasks can create a competitive edge for the company

 BPO helped Nortel transform from a bureaucratic organization into an efficient competitor
 a company can maintain its growth goals while avoiding the constraints of standard business
 bpos help companies to maintain their entrepreneurial speed and efficiency, which might otherwise be lost in expanding and maintaining efficiency
 This can prevent untimely internal changes that result from a change in a bureaucratic methodology from the informal entrepreneurial phase
 ek company tej gati se vikaas kar saki he agar uskaa poonji vyay logo yaa upkaran par niyantrit naa ho jinka karj chukaane me kai saal lag sakate hai or ve baad main puraani pad sakate he yaa samay ke saath company ke liye uchit na rahe paye | Although the above argument assumes that BPO organizations have increased visibility, management should be careful with its implementation as some issues may work against these advantages
 Problems encountered during this operation are: failure in service levels, unclear contractual issues, change in requirements and unforeseen charges and dependence on bpos which reduces efficiencies
 Consequently, it is important to consider these challenges for any company that wants to engage in business process outsourcing

 For example, outsourcing of an information system can pose a security risk from the perspective of communication and privacy
 For example, it becomes more difficult to secure data from a North American or European company when it is used or controlled from a subcontinent
 From a knowledge point of view, outsourcing creates a different relationship between the organization and the contractors because of the changing attitudes of employees, low estimate of expenses and the major risk of losing independence

 unke anusaar vyutpann evam avyutpann sabhi shabd dhaatuj hai or prakruti pratyayon ke aadhaar par unki siddhi vyutpann he
 With a view to articulate this urge and approach, he created the "unadi Sutras" and proved all the words to be derogatory

 It is clear from the "unadayo Bahumam" sutra that their position is not right - somewhere they have a tendency ie there is harmony with Dhatvartha, somewhere inattention means inefficiency, some kind of being somewhere else, sometimes some and sometimes some

 The appendix contains advice for players traveling to British East Africa
 pustak main patterson dwaara us samay liye gayi chitra bhi shaamil hai jinamein railway nirmaan; shramikon; sthaneey janajatiyon; drishyon or vanya jivan; or aadamkhoron ke chitra shaamil he
 Many publications and studies about Savo's man-eating lions are inspired by Patterson's description

 The book is written in a Victorian, ancient style that may seem overwritten at the present time

 The book describes the attack on the Ugandan railway builders in Savo, Kenya in 1898 by man-eating lions and how those lions were eventually killed by Patterson
 yah ullekhneey he ki patterson dwaara maare jane se pehle un narbhakshiyon ne ek saal ke bheetar lagbhag 135 logon ko maar daalaa tha 
 Colonel Patterson's 1907 book itself states that "at least 28 Indian porter and many unfortunate African settlers were killed by them with no official record"
 This lower number was confirmed in Dr
 Bruce Patterson's last book, The Lions of Savo: Exploring the Legacy of African Man Eaters, published in 2004 by mcgrawhill
 patterson ne chicago main field sangrahalay main yah pustak likhi jahaan ye sher pradarshit hai
 He showed that such a high number of deaths stems from the pamphlet that Colonel Patterson wrote in 1925, stating that "these two ferocious animals killed 135 Indian and African artisans and laborers in the most frightening circumstances" Liya who was employed in the construction work of Uganda Railway
 " The lion's skin can be seen at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago

 The closest city to attack by these man-eaters is Mombasa, which is the second largest city in Kenya with a population of 442,369
 saavo ke aadamkhoron kaa hamalaa tab hua jab uganda railway par kaam chal rahaa tha
 This rail route ran through Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania and included Mombasa, Nairobi, Tanga, Dar es Salaam, Mpanda, Kigma, Tunduma, Kidatu, Tabora, Mwanza, Arusha, Moshi, Nagedi, Nanyuki, Nakuru, Kisumu, Kasee , Included the major cities of Kampala, Tororo and Anua

 Although the project was successful and Patterson's bridge strengthened, it was blown up by German forces in the East Africa campaign

 Two man-eating lions emerge while they are working on it

 While hunting these lions, Patterson encounters a red-spit cobra, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, a herd of wild dogs, a deer who pretended to die, and a herd of zebras from which he caught six zebras
 unhone ek nae prakaar ke mrug ko bhi goli maari, tii

 Patterson and Mahena chase the other lion across the plains
 jab ve use pate hai or goli maarthe hai to vah sher un par hamalaa kar detaa he or unhen kai goliyaan chalaani padati hai
 The lion is not the only challenge when completing the bridge project
 deshi kamgaaron or pariyojna par kaam karne ke liye british east india se laae gaye sikhon ke bich tanaav bhi pariyojna ko khatre main daal detaa he
 At one point, Patterson faces an even greater threat than the lion - a fierce flood
 This flood sweeps the supply bridges and wraps iron strips around the trees
 ukhde hue pedo ne bhi pul ko kshati pahunchane main koi kasaar nahin chodi
 lekin acchhee tarah se nirmit pul barkaraar rahata he
 This challenge proves that the years spent working on the bridge are not wasted
 patterson dwaara pul kaa nirmaan puraa karne ke baad, unhen pataa chalata he ki ek sher train stesan ko nasht karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 When they go to see, they see large spots of blood from where the lion tried to break the roof
 vahaan ek dibbe main 3 purush the or ek anya main anishchit sankhya main kuli the
 When the lion entered, two men were sleeping on the floor
 sher ek aadmi tha or duusare par hamalaa karne kii koshish main tha
 The third man, while trying to get to another box, which the porters kept locked with their turban, tried to run away ascending from the lion's back
 kuliyon ne uske aane bhar ko daravaaza khol diya or phir use band kar diya
 In the case of other men, one was killed and eaten by a lion, while the other man lay quietly, perhaps in an attempt to save his life
 Hearing this, Patterson decided to go after this lion and eventually found him and killed him
 sher ke saath ek or najdiki muthbhed tab hoti he jab vah sher ek ghari par savaar ho jaataa he
 Ghari is a mode of transport in Kenya similar to a small trolley
 ek anya samay waapas train stesan ke raste par, patterson apane ek dost ke saath baatcheet karata he jisane kabhi koi sher nahin maaraa tha
 About a few hundred yards away, Patterson points to a pair of lions and encourages his friend to shoot them
 ek sher pehali goli par bhaag jaataa he, lekin duusare sher ko vah safaltaapurvak maar detaa he
 At the end of the book is a picture of a lion caught by a friend
 jab patterson ke jane kaa samay aata he, to kuch kuli or mul nivasee uske saath janaa chaahate hai
 However, Patterson knows that he does not have the immune system that can combat diseases outside of Africa
 isliye vah namrata se manaa kar detaa he or kuch varshon ke liye africa chhod detaa he

 nishpaadan-moolyankan, karmchaaree moolyankan ke rup main bhi gyaat, ek aisi vidhi he jiske dwaara kisi karmchaaree ke kaary nishpaadan ko moolyankit kiya jaataa he 
 nishpaadan-moolyankan jivan-vritti vikaas kaa hi ek hissaa he
 Performance appraisal is a regular review of employee performance in organizations
 saadharantah, nishpaadan-moolyankan ke nimna uddeshy hai: Using a numeric or scalar ranking method is a common method of evaluating performance in which managers are asked to identify a particular individual based on a number of objectives / traits
 kuch companiyon main, aatm-moolyankan kaa nishpaadan karne par bhi karmchaariyon ko unke prabandhak, samapdasth-karmchaariyon, adhinsth-karmchaariyon or graahakon se moolyankan praapt hote hai
 This is known as 360 ° evaluation, which produces good communication
 nishpaadan-moolyankan prakriya ke rup main prayukt ho rahi sarvaadhik lokapriy vidhiyaan nimna hai: Characteristics based methods are also used by business entities, usually dependent on factors such as integrity and interdisciplinarity
 is vishay par vaigyanik sahitya yah saboot pradaan karata he ki aise karkon par karmchaariyon ko moolyankit karne kii paddati ko tyaag dena chahie
 There are two reasons for this: chunki paribhaasha ke anusaar lakshan par aadhaarit paddatiyaan vyaktitv ke lakshanon par aadhaarit hoti hai, isliye pratipushti pradaan karne main prabandhak ko kathinaayee hoti he jo karmchaaree ke nishpaadan main sakaaratmak parivartan laa saktaa he
 The reason for this is that personality dimensions are mostly static and while the employee can change a particular behavior but cannot change his personality
 udhaahranswaroop, jis vyakti main satyanishtha kaa abhaav hota he, vah prabandhak ke sammukh jhooth bolnaa band kar saktaa he kyonki unhen pakad liya gaya he, lekin unamem abhi bhi satyanishtha kii bhaavana bahut kam hoti he or jab pakade jane kaa dar chalaa jaataa he to phir se jhooth bolne kii sambhaavna ban jaati he
 Since trait-based methods are unclear, they are easily influenced by office politics, making them less reliable as a source of information about an employee's exact performance
 in sadhano kii aspashtataa prabandhakon ko is baat kii anumati pradaan karata he ki ve jinhen chaahate hai athwa unhen jo uchit lagata hai ki unki unnati honi chahie, to ve is aadhaar par unka chayan kar sakate hai jabaki isaki jagah ve karmchaariyon ke un vishesh vyavhaaron par aadhaarit ankon ke aadhaar par bhi unka chayan kar sakate the jin vyavhaaron main unhen vyast hona / nahin hona chahie
 These practices are similar to leaving a company open to claims of discrimination because any manager can make biased decisions without the help of their specific behavioral information
 PTF report main is baat kaa daawa kiya gaya ki "yadhyapi mantralayon or vibhaagon ke vaarshik report anivaary hai, lekin shaayad hi kabhi unhen taiyaar kiya jaataa he or sarkaar ke sammukh prastut kiya jaataa he or jahaan ve prastut kiey jate hai vahaan yaa to vishay-vastu yaa praaroop ke sambandh main ve aparyaapt hote hai or shaayad hi kisi maanak kii pushti karte hai
 The recommendation was that the targets should be set by the ministries where concrete and average achievement can be estimated

 In these groups, jellyfish are also called, respectively, scyphomedusae, storomedusae, cubomedusae and hydromedusae
 sabhi jelifish upsang medusosoa main sannihit hai
 Medusa is another term for jellyfish and is therefore used exclusively for the adult phase of the life-cycle

 sher ayaal jelifish sarvaadhik vikhyath jelifish hai or vivaadaaspad taur par duniya kaa sabase lanbaa jaanavar he
 Since jellyfish are not actually fish, the term jellyfish is considered a misnomer and American public aquariums have popularized the use of the words jelly or sea jelly instead
 kai anya jelifish ko, jo ek sadi se bhi zyaada samay se aam prachlan main he, utana hi upyogi or suramya maanate hai or jelly se zyaada is shabd ko pasand karte hai
 The term jellyfish is used to denote several different types of niderion, all of which have a basic anatomical appearance resembling an umbrella, including scyphozoi, storozoi, hydrozoi, and cubozoic organisms
 kuch pathyapustaken or website scyphojoi ko "asli jelifish" ke rup main sanderbhit karti hai

 Some jellyfish also have eyespots: light-sensitive organs that do not make pictures, but which can detect light and determine the top and bottom of the water surface, reacting to sunlight
 ye aam taur par varnak bindu netrak hote hai, jinaki kuch koshikaayen ranjit hoti hai

 prasphuton nirmaan ek jatil prakriya he jo sagar kii dhaaraon, poshak tatwon, taapmaana, parbhakshan or oxigen sandratha par nirbhar he
 Jellyfish are better able to survive in water with less oxygen than their competitors and thus can thrive on plankton without competition
 jelifish lavniya jal se bhi labhanvit ho sakate hai, chunki lavan jal main adhik iodine hota he, jo polipon ko jelifish main badalane ke liye aavashyak he
 Rising sea temperatures due to climate change may also contribute to jellyfish eruption, as many species of jellyfish are better able to survive in warm waters

 Monty Graham of the Doffin Island Oceanographic Laboratory in Alabama states that "ecological systems, which have high levels of nutrients
 

 sookshm jeevon ke liye poshan pradaan karti hai, jinase jelifish aahaar grahan karte hai
 Water where there is hygiene often results in lower oxygen levels, favoring jellyfish since they can tolerate less oxygenated water than fish

 Many jellyfish go through two different life history stages during their life cycle
 pehla polipid charan he, jab jantu poshak sparshakon ke saath ek chote danthal kaa aakaar grahan karata he; yah polip sthanbaddh ho saktaa he, jo bedon yaa naav ke tal jaisi nichali sataha yaa isi tarah ke adhbstar par jeeta he, yaa vah mukt-tairta hua yaa mukt-jivi plavak ke chote tukdon yaa virale hi, machhlee yaa anya aksheruki jeevon se judaa hota he
 The polyp usually has a mouth surrounded by upward tentacles similar to anthozoi as well as small polyps close to the union nideria
polyps may be polip ekaaki yaa sanghajivi ho sakate hai or kuch vibhinn tareeqon se alangik taur par, anek polip utpann karte hue prasphutit hote hai
 Many are very small, measured in millimeters
 duusare charan main, chote polip alangik taur par jelifish utpann karte hai, jinamein se prayek medusa ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Small jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed on plankton
 medusa main trigyi samamik, chhatari ke aakaar kaa sharir hota he jo ghanti kehalaata he, jo saamanytah shikaar pakadaney vaale ghanti ke kinare ke chote ubhaar jaise-simavarti sparshakon se yukt hota he
 Some species of jellyfish do not have a polyp part in their life cycle, but they pass on to the next generation of jellyfish through the direct development of fertilized eggs from jellyfish
 jelifish ekalingashrayi hai, arthath ve aam taur par nar yaa maadaa hai 
 In most cases, both release sperm and eggs into the surrounding waters, where the eggs are fertilized and mature into a new organism
 kuch prajatiyon main, shukranu maadaa ke munh main tair kar maadaa ke sharir ke bheetar andey nishechit karte hai jahaan ve vikaas ke praarambhik daur main maujuud rahete hai
 In moon jelly, eggs settle in pits of oral arms, which form a temporary children's chamber for developing planula larvae
 nishechan or praarambhik vikaas ke baad, planula naamak kitdimbh rup viksit hota he
 The planula is a small larva surrounded by follicles
 yah thos sataha par jam jaataa he or polip ke rup main viksit hota he
 The polyp is shaped like a cup with a face surrounded by tentacles, which looks like a small ocean
 vruddhi antaraal ke baad, polip prasphutit dwaara alangik rup se prajnan shuru karata he or scyphosoa main yah khandit polip, yaa skyphistoma kehalaata he
 New scyphistomes may arise by proliferation or new immature jellies called ephyra may be formed
 kuch jelifish kii prajatiyaan medusa str se sidhe prasphuton dwaara nae medusa utpann kar sakate hai
 The eruption sites vary by species; Ranges from tentacles, bulbs to manubrium, or hydromedusae
 Some species of Hydromedusae breed by fission
 jelifish kii anya prajatiyaan sabase aam or mahatvapurn shikari jelifish main se hai, jinamein se kuch jelly ke visheshgy hai
 Other predators include tuna, sharks, swordfish, sea turtles and at least one species of Pacific salmon
 Sea birds sometimes pick up symbiotic crusts of jellyfish bells near the sea surface, essentially feeding on these waterfowl or small jellyfish nutrients of crab and prawns
 jelifish kii jivanavadhi aam taur par kuch ghanton se lekar kai maheenon ke bich hoti he
 Life-span and maximum size vary by species
 ek asaamaanya prajati ke 30 varshon ke lambey samay tak rahane kii soochna he
 Turitopsis doherney may be effectively immortalized as another species, T

 Its creator is Sarvatantra Independent Panditraj Jagannath who was a dependent of Nawab Shahabuddin and respected royalist by Asaf Khan

 Panditraj was not only poignant, gentle and subtle critic, but also a talented nature poet
 kavy ke sukumaar tatwon kii parakh ke liye manishi granthkaar ne sahrudaygat bhavukta kii kasuti ko hi sarvopari sthaan diya he
 Many ancient theories regarding the nature of poetry came into vogue in the ages, but there is some anorexia in each opinion
 ransgangadhar kii kavyaparibhaasha in aruchiyon ko shant kar detii he or vah kavyagat chamatkaar ke swaroop evam mahatv par moulik vivechan prastut kar sarvamaanya nirnay par pahunchati hai
 According to Rasgangadhar, elegance is considered the best of poetry
 sahridayahlad hi kavy kaa prayojan he or kavi kii alokik pratibha hi uskaa mul he
 Likewise, in poetry, raswaroopa, bhavadhvani, guna gaurava, shabdashakti and kavyalankars, beauty seeds and interplay of mutual difference as found in Ransgangadhara is not as elsewhere
 yah granth dhwani sampradaay kaa pratishthapak he
 The order to establish the northeast side is very heartbreaking
 based badi visheshta yah he ki isamen na keval lakshan hi moulik he apitu lakshya vishay ke udhaaharan kii granthkaar dwaara swayan pranit he, chaahe vah udhaaharan gun kaa ho yaa dosha kaa
 The uncompromising subsistence of the "naparasya khichit" pledge in Rasgangadhar has helped to make it a higher place than other poetic texts
 is granth main mammat, vishwanath evam appay dikshit ke siddhanton ko yuktipurvak apaast kar moulik siddhant sthapit kiye gaye hai
 It is said that Rasagangadhar's dimension was completed in five hours, but unfortunately only one and a half of the grains have been available till date, however, some part of the half is available which is also the ultimate benefactor to the scholar of poetry
 pratham aanan main kavy kii paribhaasha evam kavyabhed kaa vivechan kar rasswaroop or bhavadhwani kaa sangopang nirupan atyant sahrudaygamy sookshm drushti ke saath kiya gaya he

 vidwaanon kii dharna he ki shesh ananon main panditraj ne anyaanya kavyatatvon kaa evam drishy kavy ke lakshanon par bhi vichaar avashya kiya hoga
 An ancient commentary called "gurumarmprakash" is available on Rasgangadhar, which has been composed by Vayakaran Nagesh

 kisi sthaan, yaa padaarth, ko uske vaataavaran ke taap ke neeche tak thandha karne kii kriya ko prashithan kehete hai
 In the past century, these mechanical methods were expanded from making ice to keeping food and beverages cool and preserving them for long time and now they are being used on a very commercial scale
 bharat evam misr desh main isaki jaankaree anadi kaal se thi
 The method of water cooling in ceramics can be said to be a practical use
 kalantar main china, yunaan or rome ke logon ne prakritik him ke dwaara apane khaadya evam peya padaartho ko thandha rakhane kii vidhi apanaai
 Subsequently, mechanical methods of refrigeration were invented to make artificial ice
 prashithan vyavastha nimnlikhit upayon dwaara praapt kii ja sakati he : By the addition of salt in water or ice, water usually clings to the ice pieces
 jab unke saath namak milaayaa jaataa he tab vah us pani main gal jaataa he or barf pighalati he
 The latent heat of dissolving the solution heat and ice is obtained from the same mixture, and as a result the temperature of this mixture cannot fall beyond a certain limit
 jab mishran kaa taap lagbhag -21
20 sein
 tak pahunch jaataa he, tab uskaa patan ruk jaataa he or adhik namak us vilyan main daalane se koi parivartan nahin hota
 This temperature is called eutectic temperature
 is taap par vilyan ke aa jane ke baad usamen adhik namak nahin ghul saktaa
 Below are the names of some salts that can dissolve in water, and their corresponding melting values of critical heat: jab koi drav ubalata he tab uske vashpikaran, arthath drav se vaashp main parivartan ke liye, ooshmaa kii aavashyaktaa padati he, jise vashpikaran kii gupt ooshmaa kehete hai
 If a liquid is evaporated by some method at a very fast speed and cannot get heat from any other source, then it evaporates at the expense of heat inside itself
 falat: vah sheethal hone lagata he
 This principle is extensively used in modern mechanical refrigeration equipment
 isamen pani kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa, kyonki yadhyapi iske vashpikaran kii gupt ooshmaa kaa maan kaaphi unchaa hota he, phir bhi nimna tapon par uski vaashp daab alp hoti he
 Ammonia, sulfur dioxide, etc
 are used for this purpose
 yantric prashithan vyavastha ooshmaagatiki kaa ek vyaavhaarik prayog he, jisamen prasheetak dravya ko ek utkramik ooshmachakra main hokar guzarana padataa he
 This cycle is run by an engine or electric motor and in this cycle heat is discharged at low temperatures

 This makes it possible for the ear chakra to have the desired proliferative action
 saadharantaya vyavahrut honevaale prashithan chakron main vaashp sampeden, avasorana, bhaap-jet evam vayuchakra ullekhneey hai
 Before understanding these cycles, it is necessary to understand the heat cycle
 jab kisi sampidit kaa achaanak sthiroshm vidhi se prasarit hone kaa avasar diya jaataa hai tab vah thandi ho jaati he, kyonki prasaran main kiye gaye kaary hetu aavashyak urja vah bahari vaataavaran se nahin le paati apitu se hi andar se praapt karti he
 Due to this, its temperature can be increased to the extent that it freezes as a solid
 isi siddhant par kuch sampeden prashithaken kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he, jinamein prasheetak gas ke rup main vaayu kaa prayog hota he
 In this, the air is made first and in this process, air is used to expel the gas from the heat produced
 isamen vaayu ko pehle khub - jaataa he or is kriya or is kriya main utpann ooshmaa se gas ko nivrutt hone ke hetu vaayu kaa prayog hota he
 In this, air is circulated in a stable manner of diffusion ball, which causes the cylinder and air to cool down
 yah thande vaayu or sampidit vaayu prasar khabar main pravesh karti he, jahaan iskaa sthiroshm prasar hota he
 It cools down enough and cools the refrigerant's cold accumulator by reaching into the chamber or cold storage
 isse yah pun: garam hokar sampidak main pahunchati he or yah pun: aarambh hota he
 This type of compressor reaches and it starts again
 is prakaar ke sampidak kaa vyaavhaarik rup kilman prashithitr he, jo gharon ke sheet sanchayak prakoshthon main vyavahrut hota he
 The joule-tamson-cooling volume is very small, but can be increased by the reproduction process
 jul-tamson-vidhi dwaara sheethal hue gas kaa ek bhaag aagat gas kii tonti tak pahunchne se purv sheethal karne ke hetu prayukt kiya jaataa he
 This causes the incoming gas to cool down even after crossing the bottleneck

 Bhopal is the capital of the state of Madhya Pradesh in India and is also the administrative headquarters of Bhopal district
 bhopal ko jhiilon kii nagari bhi kaha jaataa he,kyonki yahan kai chote-bade taal hai
 The city suddenly made headlines when around twenty thousand people were killed in 1984 by the leakage of methyl isocyanate gas from the American company, Union Carbide
 bhopal gas cond kaa kuprabhav aaj tak vaayu pradooshan, bhoomi pradooshan, jal pradooshan ke alaava jaivik viklaangata evam anya roopon main aaj bhi jari he
 Because of this, Bhopal city is the center of many movements
 bhopal main bharat heavi electricals limited kaa ek kaarkaana he
 Recently the Indian Space Research Center has established its second 'master Control Facility'
 bhopal main hi bhartiya van prabandhan santhaan bhi he jo bharat main van prabandhan kaa ekmaatr santhaan he
 Also, Bhopal is one of the six cities in which it was decided to open the Indian Institute of Medical Sciences in 2003 and it has been operational since 2015

 Apart from this, there are many national institutes such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Indian Institute of Forest Management, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, National Institute of Sanskrit, Deemed University, Bhopal Engineering College, Gandhi Medical College and many government and public schools
 bhopal pracheen naam bhoopal he bhoopal, bhu-paal bhu = bhoomi, paal=doodh
 a second view is that another opinion is that the city was named after another king, Bhupal Shahi
 bhopal kii sthapana parmaar raja bhoj ne 1000-1055 isvi main kii thi
 His state capital was Dhar, now a district of Madhya Pradesh
 shahar kaa purv naam 'bhopal' tha jo bhoj or paal ke sandhi se bana tha
 After the collapse of the Parmar kings, the city was plundered many times
 parmaron ke baad bhopal shahar main afagaan sipaahi dost mohammad kaa shashan rahaa
 Therefore Bhopal is considered a Nawabi city, Mughal culture can be seen even today
 mughal samrajya ke vighatan kaa faaydaa uthaate hue khan ne berussia tehsil hadap lee
 After some time, Khan was presented to Bhopal village to help Gond Rani Kamalapati
 rani kii maut ke baad khan ne chote se gond rajya par kabza jamaa liya
 During 1720-1726, friend Muhammad Khan fortified the village of Bhopal and converted it into a city
 saath hi unhone nawab kii padavi apana lee or is tarah se bhopal rajya kii sthapana hui
 In friendship with the Siddiqui brothers of the Mughal court, Khan had enmity with Nizam Mir qamar-ud-din of Hyderabad
 siddiki bandhuon se nipatane ke baad 1723 main nizaam ne bhopal par hamalaa kar diya or dost mohammad khan ko nizaam kaa aadhipaty sweekaar karnaa padaa
 The Marathas also recovered Chauth from the state of Bhopal
 1737 main marathaon ne mughalon ko bhopal kii ladaai main maat di
 Khan's successors made a treaty with the British rulers in 1818 and the state of Bhopal became a princely state of the British Raj
 1947 main jab bharat ko azaadi mili, tab bhopal rajya kii vaaris aabida sultan pakistan chali gayi
