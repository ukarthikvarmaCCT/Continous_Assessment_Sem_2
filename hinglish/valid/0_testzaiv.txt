 He died in 480 BC i was done kanceyucious ke samaaj sudhaarak upadeshon ke kaaran chini samaaj main ek sthirataa aayi
 Confucius's philosophy remains a pioneer for Chinese education even today
 kanfushas ne kabhi bhi apane vichaaron ko likhit rup dena aavashyak nahin samajha
 He believed that he could be the bearer of ideas, not his creator
 vah puraatatv kaa upaask tha, kayonki uskaa vichaar tha ki usee ke madhyam se yatharth gyaan praapt praapt ho saktaa he
 He said that man can get rules for all his activities within himself
 na keval vyakti ke liye varan sampurna samaaj ke sudhaar or sahi vikaas ke niyam or swaroop pracheen mahatmaon ke shabdon evam kaarysheleyon main praapt ho sakate hai

 ve usase pracheen itihaas, kavy tathaa desh kii samjik prathaon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Confucius said that good governance and peace can be established in a country only when the ruler, minister and every person of the public continue to perform the proper duties in their place
 shaasha ko sahi artho main shaasha hona chahie, mantri ko sahi artho main mantri hona chahie
 The Confucius was once asked that if he was given the responsibility of running the governorship of a state, then he would do the first important work
 iske liye uskaa uttar tha– 'naamon main sudhaar'
 This meant that the name of the post on which he is eminent should duly perform all the duties attached to the post so that his name is meaningful
 use udhaaharan or adarsh kii shakti main purna vishwaas tha
 He believed that the common people certainly bow down to the examples which the ideal person presents with his good conduct
 yadi kisi desh ke shaasha ko iskaa bhalee bhanti gyaan kara diya jaae ki use shashan kaary chalaane main kya karnaa chahie or kis prakaar karnaa chahie to nishchay hi vah apana udhaaharan prastut karke aam janata ke aacharan main sudhaar kar saktaa he or apane rajya ko sukhi, samrudh evam sampann bana saktaa he
 On the basis of this belief, the Confucius declared that if a ruler made him his chief counselor for 12 months, he could show a lot and if he was given three years, he could embody his ideals and hopes
 Can provide
 kanfushas ne kabhi is baat kaa daawa nahin kiya ki use koi daivi shakti yaa ishwariya sandesh praapt hote the
 He used to think only about what is a person and what are his duties in society
 usne shaktipradarshan, asaadhaaran evam ammanushik shaktiyon, vidroh pravriti tathaa devi devataaon kaa zikr kabhi nahin kiya
 His statement was that it is a matter of intelligence that every person should perform his duty with full accountability and honesty and keep separate from them even while honoring the Gods and Goddesses
 uskaa mat tha ki jo manushya maanav kii seva nahin kar saktaa vah devi devataaon kii seva kya karegaa
 He had full attention for all duties of himself and others, which is why he said that a bad man can never be able to rule, no matter how powerful he is
 niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaalon ko to shaasha dand detaa hi he, parantu use kabhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki uske sadacharan ke adarsh prastut karne kii shakti se badhkar anya koi shakti nahin he
 The philosophy based on philosophical, social and political views of Confucianism is called Confucianism or Kungphutism

 Man has got this natural quality from God

 henry feol france ke khanan ejeeniyar tathaa prabandh-siddhantkaar the
 He developed the general theory of business administration which had widespread influence in the early 20th century
 feol evam unke sahakarmiyon ne is siddhanth kaa vikaas vaigyanik prabandhan ke siddhanth ke vikaas se swatantra rup se evam lagbhag usee kaal main kiya
 Fayol's name is a pioneer among the most influential contributors to the development of the modern concept of management
 prabandh kii clasical vichaardhaara ke vikaas main feyol ke prashasnic siddhant mahatvapurn kadi kaa kaam karte hai
 While Frederick Winslow was successful in revolutionizing the creation of the best practices at the workshop level in the Taylor factory, the proper work of the day, the differential wage system, and working as foremanship, Henry Fayol explained what the manager's job was and What principles will be followed to accomplish this
 kaarkaana pranali main yadi shramik kii kaary kshamta kaa mahatva he, to prabandhak kii kushalta kaa bhi utana hi mahatva he
 Fayol's contribution to improving the efficiency of management must be understood as the implications of its principles, which are currently
 henry feyol istanbul ke seemavati kshetra main 1841 main hua tha
 Her father was also a civil engineer and was appointed there in connection with the construction of Galata Bridge
 feol kaa parivaar 1847 main france laut aayaa
 In 1860, Fayol graduated in mining engineering from the Mining Academy of saint-antené
 19 varshiya ejeeniyar ne khanan company ‘compene di comentary forchambin dikaije wille’ kii sthapana kii tathaa 1888 se 1918 tak prabandh nideshak ke pad par rahe
 Its principles are used in the context of competitive enterprises of production organization which have to keep their production costs under control
 feyol pehla vyakti tha jisane prabandh ke chaar kaary nirdhaarit kiye- niyojan, sanghathan, nideshan evam niyantran karnaa
 According to Fayol, the functions of an industrial unit could be divided in this way — technical, commercial, financial, security, accounting, and management
 usne yah suzav diya ki ek prabandhak main jo gun hone aavashyak hai, ve hai-shaareerik, naitik, shaikshanik, gyaan evam anubhav
 He believed that the principles of management that can help in improving the operation of the organization, which have no limit to the capacity
 adhikansh rup se apane swayan ke anubhav ke aadhaar par usne prashasan kii avadharana ko viksit kiya
 The 14 principles propounded by him were discussed in detail in the book 'administration Industriali et Janarelli', published in 1917
 1949 main yah angreji main ‘general and industrial management’ ke sheershak se prakashit hua
 He is called the 'father of general management' due to his contribution
 feyol ke prabandh ke 14 siddhant neeche die gaye hai- The work is divided into small parts to perform the task division
 prayek kaary hetu ek yogya vyakti jo, prashikshit visheshgy he ki aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Thus, division of work leads to specialization
 feyol ke anusaar, Work in the business can be completed more efficiently if it is divided into specific tasks and each task is done by a specialized or trained employee
 isse utpaadan adhik prabhavi dhang se evam kushalta se hota he
 Thus a company has different departments, such as finance, marketing, production and human resource development etc
 prayek main kaary karne ke liye visheshgy hote hai
 Which together achieve the goal of production and sales of the company
 feyol ke anusaar kaary vibhaajan kaa siddhant sabhi kriyaaon main chaahe vah prabandhkeey hon yaa takneekee, samaan rup se lagu kiya janaa chahie
 According to Fayol, 'right is the right to order and obey, while accountability is a sub-principle of authority
 adhikaar do prakaar kaa hota he adhikrut jo ki aadesh dene kaa adhikaar he evam vyaktigat adhikaar jo ki prabandhak kaa vyaktigat adhikaar he
 ' adhikaar aupchaarik evam anaupchaarik donon hota he
 The manager needs authority and equal responsibility
 adhikaar evam uttardaayitv main samanta honi chahie
 The organization should make arrangements to prevent misuse of managerial power
 iske saath-saath prabandhak ke paas uttardayitvon ko nibhaane ke liye aavashyak adhikaar hone chahie
 For example, a sales manager has to deal with the buyer
 vah dekhtaa he ki graahak ko 60 din ke udhaar kii suvidha de den to shaayad sauda ho jaae or company ko shuddh 50 karod rupye kaa laabh hoga
 Assuming the company gives 40 days lending rights to the manager
 isse spasht hota he ki adhikaar evam daayitv main samanta nahin he
 In this case, keeping the interest of the company in mind, the manager should get the right to lend 60 days
 is udhaaharan main prabandhak ko 100 din ke liye udhaar dene kaa adhikaar bhi nahin milanaa chahie kyonki yahan isaki aavashyaktaa hi nahin he
 a manager should have the right to punish a subordinate for not intentionally following a valid order, but at the same time the subordinate should also have ample opportunity to clarify his position
 anushaasan se abhipraay sanghathan ke kaary karne ke liye aavashyak niyam evam naukari kii sharton ke paalan karne se he
 According to Fayol, discipline requires good environmental, clear and satisfactory agreement and justifiable legislation of punishment at every level
 mana ki, prabandh evam shramik sangh ke bich samjhauta hua he jiske anusaar company ko haani kii sthiti se ubaarane ke liye karmchaariyon ne bina atirikt mazdooree liye atirikt ghante kaary karne kaa samjhauta kiya he
 The management has promised to increase the wages of the employees on completion of the objective instead
 yahan anushaasan kaa arth he ki shramik evam prabandhak donon hi apane-apane vaayadon ko ek duusare ke prati kisi bhi prakaar ke dwesh bhav ke puraa karenge
 According to Fayol, each employee should have only one officer
 yadi koi karmchaaree ek hi samay main do adhikariyon se aadesh letaa he to ise aadesh kii ekta ke siddhant kaa ulanghan mana jayega
 According to the principle of unity of order, a person working in any formal organization should take orders from the same officer and be responsible for the same
 feyol ne is siddhant ko kaaphi mahatva diya
 He felt that if this principle was violated, then 'authority becomes ineffective, discipline comes into crisis, order is disturbed and stability is threatened
 ’ yah feyol ke siddhanton se mail khaataa he
 There will be no confusion about the work to be done by this
 mana ki ek vikrayakarta ko ek graahak se sauda karne ke liye kaha jaataa he tathaa use vipanan prabandhak 10 pratishat kii chhot dene kaa adhikaar detaa he
 But the Finance Department has ordered that exemption should not be given more than 5 percent
 yahan aadesh kii ekta nahin he
 This situation can be avoided if there is coordination among various departments
 sanghathan ko sabhi ikaiyon ko samanvit evam kendrit prayatnon ke madhyam se samaan uddeshyon kii ore agrasar hona chahie
 Each group of activities that have the same objectives should have the same chairman and the same plan
 yah kaarywahi kii ekta evam sahyog ko sunishchit karegaa
 For example, a company is producing motorcycles and cars
 iske liye use do alag-alag vibhaag banane chahie
 Each department should have its own plan and resources in charge
 kisi bhi tarah se do vibhaagon ke kaary ek duusare par aadhaarit nahin hone chahie
 According to Fayol, the interests of the organization should be given priority over the interests of the particular employee
 company main kaary karne main prayek vyakti kaa koi na koi hit hota he
 The company also has its objectives
 udhaaharan ke liye, company apane karmchaariyon se pratiyogi laagat par adhiktam utpaadan chaahegi
 Whereas the employee would like that he gets the maximum salary by doing minimum work
 duusari paristhiti main ek karmchaaree kuch na kuch chhot chahega jaise vah kam samay kaam kare, jo kisi bhi anya karmchaaree ko nahin milegi
 In all circumstances the interests of the group / company will supersede the interests of any individual
 kyonki karmchaariyon evam hitodhikariyon ke bade hit kisi ek vyakti ke hiton kii tulana main adhik mahatvapurn hote hai
 For example the interests of various beneficiaries such as owner, shareholder, creditor, debtor, financier, tax officer, customer and society, any individual or a small group of individuals, who want to pressurize the company that the interests are not sacrificed Can be given
 ek prabandhak ise apane anukaraniya vyavhaar se sunishchit kar saktaa he
 For example, he should not fall into the temptation to abuse his rights for the benefit of the individual / family at the expense of the larger general interests of the company / employees
 isse karmchaariyon kii nigahon main uskaa sammaan badhegaa evam karmchaaree bhi samaan vyavhaar karenge
 The total consideration and compensation should be satisfactory to both the employee and the organization
 karmchaariyon ko itani mazdooree avashya milani chahie ki kam-se-kam unka jivan str tark sangat ho sake
 But at the same time it should be within the limits of the company's payment capacity
 duusare shabdon main pratifal nyyochit hona chahie
 This will create a favorable environment and the relationship between employee and management will also be harmonious
 iske parinaam swaroop company kaa kaary sucharu rup se chalata rahegaa
 If the decision-making power is concentrated, it will be called centralization, whereas if the right is delegated to more than one person, it will be called 'decentralization'
 feyol ke shabdon main adhinsthon kaa vikendrikaran ke madhyam se antim adhikaron ko apane paas rakhane main santulan banaae rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The extent of centralization will depend on the working conditions of the company
 saamanytah bade sanghathanon main chote sanghathanon kii tulana main adhik vikendrikaran hota he
 For example, in our country, panchayats have been given more powers to decide and spend on government-funded funds for the welfare of villages
 yah rashtriya str par vikendrikaran he
 There are high officials and subordinate employees in any organization
 ucchtam pad se nimnatam pad tak kii aupchaarik adhikaar rekha ko ‘sopan shrunkhlaa’ kehete hai
 In Freole's words, there should be a series of rights and communication in organizations, which should be from top to bottom and should be manager and subordinate accordingly
 aaie ek sthiti ko dekhen jisamen ek adhyaksh he jiske adheen do adhikaar shrunkhalaayen hai
 One has 'b' 'c' 'd' 'd' 'f' and the other has 'g', 'j', 'jh', 'j', and 't'
 yadi ‘gha’ ko ‘na’ se sampreshan karnaa he to use gha, gha, ga, kha, k, chha, ja, jha, na ke maarg se chalanaa hoga
 Because the principle of step chain is being followed here
 feyol ke anusaar aupchaarik sampreshan main saamanytah is shrunkhlaa kaa ulanghan nahin karnaa chahie
 If there is an accidental situation, then d can be made directly through plane contact as shown in the figure
 yah chota maarg he tathaa iskaa praavdhaan isiilie kiya gaya he ki sampreshan main deree na ho
 In practice you see that no workers in the company can directly contact the Chief Executive Officer
 yadi use aavashyaktaa he bhi to sabhi aupchaarik str arthath forman adheekshak, prabandhak, nideshak aadi ko vishay se sambandhit gyaan hona chahie
 Only in emergent circumstances can a worker approach the chief executive authority
 feyol ke anusaar, adhiktam kaary kushalta ke liye log evam saamaan uchit samay par uchit sthaan par hone chahie
 The principle of law says that for every thing there should be a place and everything should be in its place
 y tatvatah iskaa arth he vyavastha
 If the location is fixed for everything and it is at that place then there will be no interference in the activities of the business factory
 isse utpaadakta evam kshamta main vruddhi hogi
 In Fayol's words, to ensure fairness towards all employees, goodwill and experience is required
 in karmchaariyon ke saath jitna sambhav ho sake nishpaksh vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 This principle emphasizes compassion and justice in the behavior of managers towards workers
 feyol yada-kada bal prayog ko aniyamit nahin maanata he
 Rather he says that dull persons should be treated strictly so that every person should get the message that every person is equal in the eyes of management
 kisi bhi vyakti ke saath ling, dharm, bhashaa, jati, vishwaas athwa rashtriyata aadi ke aadhaar par koi bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 In practice, we observe that nowadays multinational companies work together in a non-discriminatory environment
 in companiyon main prayek vyakti ko unnati ke samaan avasar praapt hote hai
 That is why we find that Indian-origin CEO like Rajat Gupta became the head of a multinational company like mckinsey Incorporation
 abhi haal hi main ‘bharat main janme americavasi arun sareen britain kii badi telecom company ke vodaphone li- ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari bane hai
 According to Fayol, the employee's turnover can be minimized to maintain the efficiency of the organization
 y karmchaariyon kaa chayan evam niyukti uchit evam kathor prakriya ke dwaara kii jaani chahie
 But after selection, they should hold the post for a minimum period of time
 unka kaarykaal sthir hona chahie
 They should be given suitable time to show results
 is sandarbh main kisi bhi prakaar kii tadarthata karmchaariyon main asthirataa asuraksha paidaa karegi
 He would like to leave the organization
 bhartee, chayan evam prashikshan laagat unchi hogi
 That is why the stability of the tenure of the employee is best for the business
 feyol kaa maananaa he ki, fkarmchaariyon ko sudhaar ke liye apni yojanaon ke vikaas evam unako lagu karne ke liye protsaahit karnaa chahie
 Initiative capacity means taking the first step towards self-motivation
 isamen yojana par vichaar kar phir usko kriyanvit kiya jaataa he
 This is one of the hallmarks of a wise man
 pahal-kshamta ko protsaahit karnaa chahie lekin iskaa yah arth nahin ki apane aapako kuch bhinn dikhaane ke liye company kii sthapit reeti-niti ke viruddh kaary karen
 a good company is one that has employee feedback methods according to which the initiative suggestions are rewarded which will lead to tangible reduction in cost / time
 feyol ke anusaar, fprabandh ko karmchaariyon main ekta evam parsparik sahyog kii bhaavana ko badhaava dena chahie
 The collective work of management should be promoted, especially in large organizations
 kyonki aisa na hone par uddeshyon ko praapt karnaa kathin ho jayega
 It will also cause loss of coordination
 sahyog kii bhaavana ke poshan ke liye prabandhak ko karmchaariyon se puri baatcheet main ‘main’ ke sthaan par ‘ham’ kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 This will create mutual trust and feeling of belonging among the group members
 isse jurmaane kii aavashyaktaa bhi nunatam ho jaaegi
 It is clear from the above discussion that 14 principles of management of Fayol are widely applicable to the problems of management and today they have a profound influence on the thinking of management

 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the loss of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell
 leftinent governor sar wiliam maikenji ne kalakatta toun haul main bose kaa pradarshan dekha
 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article
 unka doosraa lekh oktober 1895 main landan kii royal socity ko lard rele dwaara bheja gaya
 In December 1895, the London magazine electrician published Bose's article "on a new electro-polariscope"
 us samay angreji bolne vaali duniya main loj dwaara gadhe gaye shabd 'kohirar' k prayog hertz ke tarang resiver yaa detector ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics
 jagadishchandra bose pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio tarange detect karne ke liye semiconductor jankshan kaa istemaal kya tha or is paddati main kai microwave components kii khoj kii thi
 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research
 yah saare upkaran aaj bhi kolkata ke bose institute main maujuud hai
 a 1
3 mm multibeam receiver housed in Arizona's NRAO 12 meter telescope is built on the principles of the research paper written in 1897 by Acharya Bose
 sar neville mott ko 1977 main solid state electronics main kiye apane shodhakarya ke liye nobel puraskaar mila tha
 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures
 alag alag paristhitiyon main cell membrane potential ke badlaav kaa vishleshan karke ve is nattejey par pahunche kii paudhe samvedansheel hote hai ve " dard mahasoos kar sakate hai, sneh anubhav kar sakate hai ityadi "
 Bose did a comparative study of fat response on different metal and plant tissues
 unhone alag alag dhaatuo ko electrical, maikenical, rasinic or thermal tareekon ke mishran se uttejit kiya tha or koshikao or dhaatu kii pratikriya ke samaantaaon ko note kiya tha
 Bose's experiments showed a cyclic fatig reaction in simulated cells and metals
 iske saath hi jivit koshikao or dhaatuo main alag alag tarah ke uttejnaaon ke liye vishesh chakree fatig or recovery rispance kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 Acharya Bose made a graph of the electrical response of changing plants with the changing electrical stimuli, and also showed that when the plants were given poison or anesthetic, their reactions started to work and became zero later
 lekin yah pratikriya zinc dhaatu ne nahin dikhaai jab use oksalik acid ke saath treet kiya gaya
 In 1917 Jagdish Chandra Bose was conferred the title of "knight" and was soon elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London for Physical and Biology
 bose ne apana puraa shodhakarya bina kisi achche upkaran or prayogshaala ke kiya tha isaliye jagadish chandra bose ek acchhee prayogshaala banane kii soch rahe the
 "bose Institute" is the result of this thinking, which is a famous center of the nation for research in science
 yah hindi pustakon ke ek pramukh prakaashak hai
 This publication institute was founded by Dinanath Malhotra in 1950 and shocked the world by removing very cheap and excellent paperback books worth one rupee
 desh ke tamaam bade lekhakon main is prakaashan se chhapane kii hode rahati thi
 Tejpal Singh Dhama, the editor of this institute, edited and published books of many eminent writers of the country during his decades of tenure

 Harish Chandra Verma is a physicist and professor working at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur
 iske purv unhone patna ke vigyaan mahavidhyalay main adhyaapan kiya
 His field of work is nuclear physics
 unhone anek pustakon kii rachana kii he jinamein 'concepts of physics' atyant lokapriy he
 He was born in Darbhanga in 1952 AD
 apni pustakon main inhone apane mata-pita or bhartiya samskruti ko apane jivan main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn bataaya he
 His father was a teacher
 harish chandra verma kaa janm 3 april 1952 ko bihar rajya ke darbhanga jile main hua tha
 As a child, he was not sharp in reading
 unke pitaaji shikshak the
 Initially, his father taught mathematics and science
 skool ke dinon main inhe vigyaan or ganit main zyada ruchi nahin thi
 To graduate, Harish Chandra Verma was enrolled in Patna Science College
 yahan ke faikalti se prabhavit hokar harish chandra verma ke man main vigyaan or ganit vishay main ruchi badi
 His interest grew so that the boy, who struggled in the high school examination, took third place in bsc Physics of Patna University
 snaatak campalit karne ke baad harish chandra verma ne GATE kii pariksha nikaali or iaiti kanpur se msc ke liye daakhila liya
 At IIT Kanpur, Harish Chandra Verma topped all boys and achieved a 9
9 GPA out of 10
0
 uske baad unhone iaiti kanpur se hi doctoret kii padhai kii or teen varsho se bhi kam samay main piechdi kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 While studying in Science College, he saw that children are not enjoying the study of physics and are getting bored after studying
 jitna experiment harish chandra verma ne apane padhai ke dinon main physics ke kitabo ke saath kiya tha utana experiment tej vidhyaarthee bhi nahin kar rahe the
 The reason was language and cultural differences
 gramin prishthbhumi ke log pustak kii bhashaa main ulajh kar rah jate the or ve uski avadharana or nishkarsh tak pahuchane se pehle hi apni ruchi kho baithte the
 To overcome all these problems, Harish Chandra Verma thought of writing a book that could ease this difficulty of the language
 iske liye unhone 8 saal tak kathin parishram kiya or fal kr rup main logo ke bich aayaa “concepts of Physics” 
 This book was successful in highlighting the beauty of physics
 is pustak kii safalataa kaa kaaran tha isaki saral bhashaa ,dichasp sankhyatmak udhaaharan or bhartiya samskruti ke saath sambandh | yah pustak iaiti-jeii kii taiyaari ke lagbhag sabhi chaatro dwaara upyog kii jaati he
 It was a great gift given by Harish Chandra Verma to Indian students, science and society
 iaiti kanpur aane se pehle vah lagbhag 15 varshon tak patna vigyaan mahavidhyalay main rahe
 Dr
 HC Verma joined IIT Kanpur in 1994 as Assistant Professor
 yahaan, unhone kai paathyakramon ke chatro ko padhaaya or “kwantum physics” naamak ek pustak bhi likhaa
 Dr
 HC Verma also conducted research in experimental nuclear physics
 iaiti kanpur main niyamit kaary ke alaava, unhone shiksha or samaaj ke laabh ke liye kai saamaajik-shaikshik pahal bhi kii
 Some of these aspects include the School Physics Project, Shiksha Sopan
 unhone 30 june 2017 ko aupchaarik ritairement kii ghoshnaa kii
 He was explaining the basics of physics to people for 38 years
 ahur mazda avastai bhashaa main pracheen irani dharm ke ek devtaa kaa naam he jinhen parsi dharm ke sansthaapak zarathustra ne ajanma or sarvajna parameshwar bataaya tha

 Light and goodness to Ahur Mazda is the presidency of the evil demons against him Angira Manu
 aadim hind-irani logon ke dharm main sansar or brahmand main achchhai or sahi vyavastha ke mahatva par jor tha
 When the Indian Aryans and Iranians were divided, for this correct arrangement, the word 'rit' was formed in Sanskrit and in Iranian languages its homogeneous 'arta', another form of 'asha'
 dhyaan dijiye ki kyonki angrezi bhi hind-europea bhashaa parivaar kii sadsy he isliye usamen bhi sahi ke liye is se miltaa-julata 'rhit' shabd he
 The verb known to the contrary is called 'druh' in Sanskrit and 'druj' in Persian, i
e
 'false' or 'bad'
 parsi dharm main ahur mazda arta ke liye or druj ke khilaaf hai jabaki angira manyu us se vipareet he
 The word 'ahura' is related to Sanskrit 'asura' and the word 'mazda' is from Sanskrit 'medha'
 rugveda main varun or kai devataaon ko 'asur' kii oopaadhi di gayi he 
 This shows that ancient Iranians worshiped 'asuras' and Hindustani Aryans worshiped Devas
 ahurmajd pracheen iran ke paigambar zarathustra kii ishwar ko pradutt sangya
 Omnipotent, omnipotent, one of the creators of the universe, foster and paramount and unique, who cannot be touched by evils and who is spotless

 It is considered the duty of every Zarathustra peerage to follow in religious rules; He has to say in this way - i believe in the philosophy of Ahuramazd 


 i disregard the lordship of the discrete gods and those who believe in them
 is prakaar prayek navamtanuai prakaash kaa sainik hota he jiskaa punit kartavya andhkaar or vaasana kii shaktiyon se dharmsanthaan ke liye ladanaa he
 Aye Majd! When i got your first interview, thus the Prophet has said in a well-known verse, i have only found you as the creator of the world, and you are considered to be the creator of conscience and the real creator of religion and the regulator of all deeds of mankind
 
 ahurmajd kaa saakshaat keval dhyaan kaa vishay he
 This is why the Prophet has tried to explain about God by taking shelter of similar metaphors and metaphors, by which the imagination of the infinite can be understood by ordinary people
 vah ishwar se swayan vaani main prakat hokar upadesh karne ke liye aradhana karata he or is baat kaa nirdesh karata he ki apane chakshuon se sabhi vyakt evam avyakt vastuon ko dekhtaa he

 " — Richard Shaull, drawing on Paulo Freire Paulo Fryer contributed a philosophy of education that came not only from the classical point of view of Plato, but also from modern Marxist and colonialist thinkers

 Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Fryer, The Repeal of Discrimination while Punishing the Oppressors, distinguishes between situations in an unjust society: there is no direct reference to its greatest influence for the oppressive and oppressive Freire distinction, which in 1802 Stems back at least as far as Hegel
 freyar champiyanon ne shiksha ko dalit logon ko apni aabaadi ko waapas paane kii ijaajat deni chahie, badale main unki sthiti par kaabo paa lee phir bhi, vah sweekaar karte hai ki is ke liye, utpeedit vyakti ko unki mukti main ek bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 As he states: koi shiksha nahin he jo vastav main mukti he, unhen durbhaagya ke rup main ilaaj karke or utpeedakon ke bich se unke anukaran model ke liye pesh karne ke dwaara utpeedan se dur rah saktaa he
 Persecution must be their own example in their struggle for liberation
 isi tarah, utpeedakon ko apni jivan style par punarvichaar karne or utpeedan main apni bhoomika kii jaanch karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie, agar sachche mukti ghatit hoti he: "jo log apane aap ko khud ko aatmanirbhar rup se aatmasamarpit karte hai, ve khud ko nirantar jaanchana chahie" Freire believed that education could not be divorced from politics; Teaching and learning are political acts in themselves
 Freire defined this relationship as the main principle of critical pedagogy
 shikshakon or chaatro ko "raajnneeti" ke bare main jaagruk hona chahie jo ki shiksha ke aas-paas he jis tarah se chaatro ko sikhaaya jaataa he or jo unhen sikhaaya jaataa he vah ek raajnneetik agenda main kaary karata he
 Teachers, themselves, they come to class with political ideas
 freeper kaa maananaa tha ki "shiksha samaj main aata he kyonki mahilaon or purushon ko siikhnaa he ki ve khud ko sikh sakate hai or khud ko rimek kar sakate hai, kyonki mahilaayein or purushon ko jaanane main sakasham hone ke rup main swayan ke liye zimmedaari lene main sakasham hai 


 jaanate hue bhi ki ve jaanate hai or jaanate hai ki ve don 'tii "
 Banking model of education Main article: Banking model of education In the context of education science, Fryer is best known for his attack on what he called the "banking" concept of education, in which the student was thought to be a blank account to be filled by the teacher
 vah kehete hai ki "yah vastuon ko praapt karne main chaatro ko badal detaa he
 It attempts to control thinking and action, motivates men and women to adjust to the world, and inhibits their creative power
 " mul aalochana nai nahin thi- ek sakriy shikshaarthi ke rup main rus kii sankalpana bachche ke pehle se hi ek kadam dur he 
 In addition, thinkers such as John Dewey strongly criticized the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education
 davy ne aksar shiksha ko saamaajik parivartan ke liye ek tantra ke rup main varnit kiya he, "yah samajha jaataa he ki" shiksha saamaajik chetana main saajha karne kii prakriya kaa ek niyaman he; or is saamaajik chetana ke aadhaar par vyaktigat gatividhi kaa samaayojan hi ekmaatr nishchit tarika he saamaajik punarnirmaan "freeper ke kaam, haalanki, is avadharana ko adhyatan kiya or ise vartmaan siddhanton or shiksha kii prathaon ke saath sandarbh main rakhaa, jo ab mahatvapurn adhyapanshaastra kaha jaataa he Culture of silence freeper ke mutabik, prabhaavshaalee saamaajik sambandhon kii pranali 'maun kii samskruti' paidaa karti he jo peedit logon main ek nakaaratmak, chup or dabang hui aatm-chhavi ko paidaa karti he
 The learner must develop a critical consciousness to understand that a culture of silence is designed to suppress a culture of silence can also lead to "domineering individuals by whom the culture is severely reacted to
 They are forced by a dominant culture
 " The social hegemony of race and class is added to the traditional education system, through which the "culture of silence" ends the path of thought that becomes the language of criticism
