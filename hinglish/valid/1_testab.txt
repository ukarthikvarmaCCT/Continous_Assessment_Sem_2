 Everyone's cameraman has been beaten

 i have lived long in Kashmir, so it was strange to hear why people are beating the media persons

 To know this, i decided to go down town
 shubhachintakon kii salaah kaanon main thi, so ankhon se pehle maahaul bhaanpane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 After reaching Batmalu, Tankpora etc

 kaha, koi sunne vaala nahin
 Introducing myself, i said that i am from NDTV, i have come from Delhi, along with camera and cameraperson

 Hearing that people beat the camera here
 unhone meri taraf dekha or kaha, yahi to taqalif he
 You are showing only one side of the media
 isane ye kiya, usne wo kiya
 
 
 No media came to us to see what reached us
 hamane jab shor kiya, to hamen pathar maarane vaala bataakar badnaam kiya gaya
 Yes, we do stones, but why do we, the media does not mean anything
 maine unase kaha, patharbazi ko kisi bhi tarah se sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 He said that there is despair and frustration among the people
 aise main kuch log unako bargala lete hai
 If help could reach them, then they would not be misled by anyone

 People accused of partiality in relief and rescue
 gharon main jamaa pani ko nikaalane kaa ab tak koi intazaam nahin kiya gaya he, yah shikaayat bhi kii
 And all their complaints were either not heard by the media or they were not shown to the country
 isliye ye media ke kilaaf ho gaye or media ko nishaanaa banane lage
 In fact, the common complaint of the people of the down town and the area of dal was seen that no one came to help them, from rescue to relief
 inke mutabiq sena or vayusena ke hawaii jahaaz, helicopter or andiaref kii boat main chadhe mediavaale puri tasviir ko aise bayaan karte rahe, maano raahat or bachaav har zaruuratmand tak pahunch gaya ho
 When the water was on the rise, it is understandable that reporting could have been done with the help of chopper or boat and the report would have been the same as seen by helicopter or boat
 lekin yahaan shikaayat yah he ki pani utar jane ke baad bhi media un tak sidhe nahin pahunchaa
 The bus was engaged in relief and rescue work
 helicopter par pathar story ko sabase bada banaakar down toun ke logon ko badnaam kiya gaya
 While the reason behind their anger could not find any place
 laachaari se upji niraashaa aakraamakata main badal gai
 Many media persons were beaten up
 haalanki ise kahin se sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa, is baat ko bhi ye maanate hai
 One thing was heard again and again in this tour
 inke liye kuch bhi kar lo, ye apana hone vaale nahin
 Unfortunately, some media persons also found this idea
 aisa maanane waalon se maine poocha ki upi or bihar main baadh aati he
 They said yes
 maine poocha, vahaan raahat or bachaav kaa kaam hota he
 The answer came, yes
 phir maine poocha ki vahaan bhi kai log madad na pahunchane kii shikaayat karte hai
 The answer came, yes
 naaraazgi main dm-siem-piem ke khilaaf narebaazi karte hai, haa karte hai
 
 
 Then if there is dissatisfaction with the relief and rescue work, then what is the need to look at it with some other glasses? yah sach he ki bahut logon tak sarkari madad nahin pahunchi he or log gusse main hai
 Separatist forces are trying to capitalize on this opportunity
 ve kaamayaab na hon iske liye sarkaar or media kii taraf se zyaada sajagata or samvedansheeltaa kii zarurat he

 dalit-muslim unity exercise in Maharashtra: 14% Dalit and 12% Muslim owaisi-ambedkar will fight separately in Maharashtra elections Deprived Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) led by All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen Chief Asaduddin Owaisi and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar in Maharashtra Together they gave the slogan 'jai bhim-jai Meem'
 is kavayad ne maharashtra main teen dashak pehle anderworld don haji mastaan or dalit netaa jogendra kawade ke dalit-muslim gathjod kii yaad taaja kar di
 In Maharashtra, this effort seems to be disintegrating even before establishing its roots on the ground
 loksabhaa chunaav main milakar chunaav ladane vaale ovaisi or ambedkar ne vidhansabha chunaav main alag-alag ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 What is the equation of Muslim and Dalit population: Maharashtra has 14% Dalit and 12% Muslim population
 in donon samudaay ke sahare satta par kabiz hone ke liye kai raajnneetik dalon ke dwaara aajamaaish kii he
 Many leaders have tried so far to unite the dalit-muslims, but no one has been able to bring it down to the ground
 aise main ovaisi or ambedkar kii siyaasi dosti main ai daraar se vidhansabha chunaav main dalit or muslim donon maayoos najar aa rahe hai
 In this way, the slogan of 'jai bhim-jai Meem' seems to be blowing the air completely
 gathbandhan tuutane se vot ke bikharaav kaa khatrainin ke maharashtra pradesh adhyaksh imtiyaaj jaleel kehete hai, 'prakaash ambedkar ke saath gathbandhan tuutane se dalit or muslim voton kaa bikharaav hoga or iskaa nuksaan donon partiyon ko uthaanaa padegaa
 However, AIMIM is blaming Prakash Ambedkar for breaking the alliance
 jabaki prakaash ambedkar maanate hai ki ovaisi kii jid or seat kii zyada demand ke chalate gathbandhan tutaa he
 At the same time, they feel that the possibility of an alliance is not completely gone
 bataa den ki isi saal loksabhaa chunaav main prakaash ambedkar ke saath milakar ovaisi kii party AIMIM maharashtra kii aurangabad sansadeey seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Also, this alliance surprised everyone by securing 14 percent votes in the state
 ovaisi-ambedkar gathbandhan ke chalate maharashtra kii 12 loksabhaa siton par congress-ensipi ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Political analyst Sanjeev Chandan says that the social, economic and political condition of both Dalit and Muslim communities in Maharashtra is same, but many times it has also been seen that both communities come face to face
 
 saath hi maharashtra main donon samudaay kaa netritv karne vaale log bhi aise faisle le lete hai, jiske chalate donon samudaay ek saath nahin aa pate
 In such a situation, it becomes the responsibility of Prakash Ambedkar to show great heart for dalit-muslim solidarity
 sanjeev chandan kehete hai ki ambedkar or ovaisi kaa gathbandhan loksabhaa chunaav kii tulana main vidhansabha chunaav main behatar pradarshan kar saktaa hai
 Owaisi's party has also won several small-scale elections
 aurangabad nagar palika main AIMIM ke 25 parshad jeetne main safal rahe
 The party has good hold in the Muslim society of Marathwada, in such a situation, it could have made a big political upset with the Dalit community
 bijepi kii madad kaa lagata rahaa he aropaprakash ambedkar or asaduddin ovaisi ke khilaaf ek gambhir iljaam aksar lagaaya jaataa he ki ye donon netaa duusari partiyon kaa vot katkar bijepi ko phayda pahunchaate hai
 Although both the leaders deny this, saying that they do politics according to their ideology, if any party benefits from it then it is not their concern
 daliton ke vot se hota he bijepi ko phydadhivaktaa firdaus mirza kehete hai ki maharashtra main dalit samudaay do tarah kaa he
 One of them is Ambedkarite and the other is Hindutva
 hindutv kii taraf jhukaav rakhane vaala dalit samudaay bijepi or shivasena ke saath majoobati se judaa hua he
 Apart from this, there are several Ambedkarite parties in Maharashtra, of which Ramdas Athawale faction is already with BJP
 iske alaava basapa or prakaash ambedkar sahit tamaam dal hai, jinke bich dalit vot bantane kii sambhaavna he
 Writer Sambhaji Bhagat, who monitors the politics of Maharashtra, says that in the current political climate of Maharashtra, both dalit-muslims want to unite
 lekin prakaash ambedkar or ovaisi ke apane raajnneetik agenda hai, jinke chalate donon alag hue hai
 Now the question has arisen in front of the dalit-muslim community, where will they go? It is believed that the larger section may turn to the congress-ncp
 prakaash ambedkar kaa saath chhodkar unka cader khuleam congress main ja rahaa he
 There is no political understanding of Muslims
 Maharashtra social activist Amir Ali Ajani says that the Dalit community of Maharashtra is more politically, socially and ideologically aware than the Dalits of the rest of the states of the country
 jabaki muslim samudaay kii apni koi saamaajik or raajnneetik soch dikhaai nahin detii
 That is why there is no solidarity between the two communities in Maharashtra
 prakaash ambedkar or asaduddin ovaisi bhale hi jai bhim or jai mim karen, lekin in donon netaaon ne jamini str kabhi bhi ekajutata ke liye andolan nahin chalaaya he
 Dalit thinker Ashok Meshram says that Asaduddin Owaisi has no connection with Ambedkarism
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav main prakaash ambedkar or ovaisi ke saath aane se dalit-muslim ekajute ho rahe the, lekin donon netaaon ke faisle se ek baar phir unke saamne mushkil khadi ho gai he
 If these two had come together, the political equation of Vidarbha in Maharashtra could have changed
 84 main mastaan or kawade ne kii thi pahalowaisi or prakaash ambedkar se pehle 1984 ke bhiwandi dangon ke baad haji mastaan mirza or dalit netaa va piples republican party of india ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh jogendra kawade ne milakar maharashtra main dalit-muslim alpsankhyak suraksha mahasang kaa gathan kiya tha
 But the dalit-muslim experiment collapsed after the death of Haji Mastan in 1994
 teen dashak ke baad ek baar phir usee raah par khadaa najar aa rahaa he dalit-muslim gathjod formula

 yogiyon or sanyasiyon ke liye yah vah din he, jab shiv kailash parvat ke saath ekaakaar ho gaye the
 In the Yogic tradition, Shiva is not worshiped as God, but is considered the first Guru, Adi Guru, who was the originator of the science of yoga
 kai sadiyon tak dhyaan karne ke baad shiv ek din vah puri tarah sthir ho gaye
 All the movement within him stopped and he became completely immobile
 yahi din mahashivaratri he
 Hence sannyas view Mahashivratri as a night of stability

 ganga main snaan karne se logon ko na sirf man kii shanti milti he, balki is din daan karne kaa bhi khaas mahatv hota he
 If you are unable to reach any ghat of Ganga, then you can also take a bath with the cold water of the house
 is din vishnupadi, punyasalila maa ganga kaa prithvi par avataran hua, isliye yah din 'ganga dashahra' (jyeshtha shukla dashami) yaa lokbhasha main jeth kaa dashahra ke naam se bhi prachlit he
 Heaven is attained by the touch of Ganga water
 jyeshtha shukla kii dashami tithi ko pahaado se utarkar maa ganga haridwar brahmakund main ain thim or tabhi se is din ko ganga dashahra ke rup main manaaya jane laga
 It is believed that taking a bath in the Ganges on this auspicious date of Gangavataran is extremely beneficial

 Chhattisgarh has always had a tough fight in the assembly elections
 saal 2003 ke chunaavon main bhaajapa or congress ke bich vot pratishat main sirf 2
 There was a difference of 55 per cent
 phir 2013 ke chunaavon main yah antar or simatakar mahaj 0
 Stayed at 75 percent
 is baar basapa or purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii janata congress chhattisgarh (jessisi) main gathjod kii ascharyajanak ghoshnaa ne chunavi jang ko or pechida bana diya he
 After all, what does this new political alliance mean for the political parties of Chhattisgarh? Raman Singh, who has become the bjp's chief minister of a state for the longest period in the country, is constantly trying to return there for the fourth time
 yah kisi se chipa nahin he ki congress khud basapa se talmail banane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 On the other hand, the ruling BJP was also watching this development very closely as nine out of the ten seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes in the state's total assembly of 90 seats are currently occupied by it
 is talmail kii jaankaree lakhanu main dete hue mayawati ne 20 sitambar ko kaha ki unhone is bare main kaaphi soch-vichaar kar faisla liya he
 The BSP has got 35 seats and 55 jccs in the alliance
 jogi mukhyamantri pad kaa cheharaa honge
 Mayawati's point is that she is following the same old logic that in the event of coordination with the Congress, the bsp's vote is transferred to the Congress but the Congress vote does not go to the BSP
 aise main basapa kii keemat par congress phayda uthaa leti he
 But in the alliance with JCC, there is a strong possibility of getting the votes of Scheduled Castes as Jogi has a God-like status in the Satnami community
 yah rajya main anusuchit jatiyon kaa sabase bada samudaay he
 Satnamis have a strong emphasis in the 14 assembly seats of central Chhattisgarh and hold 20-25 per cent of the votes there
 iske alaava aadha darjan anya siton main bhi unki badhibia sankchaya he
 If these seats get full support of this community and then small communities like Kutchi and Mallah also come together then the victory of BSP-JCC candidates can be ensured
 congress kii sendhamari karke uske netaaon ko apane yahaan le jane se jessisi ke halaat kuch samay se kharaab hai
 In such a situation, it is like Sanjeevani to align with the BSP
 ab madhya chhattisgarh main tikaton ke bantwaare main unki ahm bhoomika ho sakati he or phir shaayad trishanku vidhansabha nirvaachit hone kii sthiti main chunaavon ke baad bhi
 Ajit Jogi's son Amit Jogi says, "mayawati ji knows that Congress is a sinking ship in Chhattisgarh
" sirf jessisi hi bhaajapa kaa vikalp ho sakati he
 Unhappy with the bsp's decision to accompany Jogi, the Congress is now working on a plan to bring the Scheduled Castes with them
 party ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki anusuchit jati ke votaron kii acchhee sankhya vaale madhya chhattisgarh kii 14 siton main se jogi 4-5 seat jeet sakate hai par iskaa asli nuksaan bhaajapa ko hoga kyonki is samay 10 arakshit siton main se 9 siten usee ke paas hai

 The BSP continues to field candidates at the behest of the BJP
 ab bhaajapa kii "bi'' team jogi se talmail karne se basapa benakaab ho gai he
 "due to this uncertainty prevailing over scheduled castes seats in central Chhattisgarh, it has now become necessary for the BJP to increase its strength on the tribal seats in the north and south of the state
" uttar main uske liye sthiti utani aasaan nahin hogi kyonki sarguja ke tatkaaleen shahi parivaar se aane vaale singhdev us ilaake main kaaphi rasookh rakhte hai
 Therefore, the BJP is hoping to reverse the current seat of seats in the south, where the Congress currently has eight seats and the BJP has four seats
 raman singh sarkaar ne 13 lakh janajaatiy pariwaron ko kendrit karke hi haal main yah faisla liya ki vah sukama, bijapur, dantewada or narayanpur ke dakshin jilon main tendu patta todgaye waalon ko bonus kii raashi pratyaksh laabh hastantaran (debiti) se na dekar nakad degi
 There will be direct competition between BJP and Congress in the northern and southern areas of the state
 bhaajapa anusuchit jatiyon ke vot bhi baantne kii koshish kar sakati he
 This task is difficult but not impossible
 satnamiyon main bhi kai saare sampradaay hai, jaise ki kabirpanthi
 Their leader Prakash Muni Naam Sahib has good relations with Raman Singh
 sitambar ke pehle saptaah main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi unase mulaakaat kii thi
 BJP state president Dharamlal Kaushik says, "the BJP is working on a plan to win 65 seats
 yah gathbandhan congress ke liye jhatka he, bhaajapa ko isse koi fark padane vaala nahin he
 "BJP may get into trouble on the issue of unemployment
" jessisi ne ise bada mudda bana rakhaa he or jogi ne to yuvaaon ke liye shaikshanik yogyata aadhaarit berogari bhatte kaa vaada kiya he
 Keeping the Chhattisgarhi honor in front, he has also announced separate jobs for the original residents

 However, Raman Singh remains the most popular contender for the post of Chief Minister with a rating of around 41 per cent on the India Today political stock exchange
 kul 21 fisadi reating ke saath baghel unke sabase nikat pratidwandvi hai
 Raman Singh's ambitious communication revolution plan may give him widespread support in which he is providing smartphones with voice and data connections to 5

 Often, being under stress can also damage your digestion

 It also inhibits the healing of stomach ulcers

 DDA has been making 82-year-old Rajpal Mehra cry for the past 22 years
 maamla pita kii sampatti chaar bhaaiyon ke naam par karne kaa he jise lekar raajapaal ne 1993 main aavedan kiya tha
 But the demand was bribed which they did not lose
 lihaaja maamla ajtak atka he
 Rajpal says that initially the DDA employee had demanded a bribe of Rs 10,000
 maine kaha rishwat nahin duungaa to sajaa ab tak mil rahi he
 The DDA remained silent for the first 6 years on this matter of registering mutations, and in 1999, when Rajpal raised this matter in the DDA Vice President's Janata Darbar, the process of receiving letters from the DDA at home started in which all The documents were asked to be resubmitted
 ab jaakar artiai ke ek jawaab main didie ne mana he ki vibhaag se galati hui he
 Not only this, Vishwamohan Bansal, who was the Principal Commissioner, Advisor to the Secretary in DDA, had said in 2009 only why the matter is taking time
 iskaa jawaab bansal sahab ko bhi ritair hone ke paanch saal baad tak nahin mila
 Vishwamohan Bansal says that the property has to be known to the sons from the father and is to be known equally
 kisi ko koi dikkat nahin to phir vibhaag ko kya dikkat he
 Now when NDTV put the matter in front of the vice-chairman of DDA, they too were surprised as to how long all the documents were present
 didie upaadhyaksh balvindar kumaar ne bharosa dilaayaa he or kaha he ki aap unako hamaare paas bhej dijie, agar sab kaagaj thik hai to phir ham haathon haath muteshan kaa kaam kar denge
 This whole case is reminiscent of Srilal Shukla's popular character Langar of Ragdarbari who fought a crusade for fourteen years for mimicry, but this battle of DDA and Rajpal was stretched even longer but the iniquity is still heavy
