 linaks unics jaisaa ek oparating system he
 It is the most successful and most popular software of open source software or open source software
 yah jeepiel v 2 license ke antargat sarv saadhaaran ke upyog hetu uplabdh he or iskaa kuch bhaag unics se prerit he
 Originally it was created by developing minics

 At that time, AT&T
 The company was a controlled monopoly so it could not sell computer software
 usne ise, sorce code ke saath, bina shart, sarkaar tathaa vishvavidhyalayon ko de diya, ve chaahe to usamen pherbadal kar sakate hai
 By the 1980s, Unix became the most popular, powerful, and stable operating system, although by that time it had undergone several modifications
 unics main ek kami thi - isko samajhnaa tathaa chalaanaa mushkil he
 Andrew Tenenbaum is a professor of computer science at Amsterdam
 unhone isaki sahaayta ke liye minix naam kaa program likhaa
 It also had some shortcomings
 linus torwald finland ke helsinki vishvavidhyalay main kamputer vigyaan ke chaatr the
 He wrote a program to overcome the shortage of Minix which was later called 'unix of Linus' or Linux for short
 iskaa sabase pehla kor yaa karanal unhone 1991 main internet main post kiya
 By then Richard Stallman's 'GNU' project had started
 linus torwald ne isse bahut saare program apane linaks main liye
 Hence Richard Stallman says
 ki ise 'gnew-linaks' kahana chaiye
 But this name could not work because of its long standing
 par iskaa arth yah nahin hai ki linaks kii safalataa main gnew project kaa haath nahin he
 Linux was not possible without the GNU project

 Unix was first released in 1971, and was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time
 baad main, 1973 main ek pramukh agrani drushtikon main, ise denis richi dwaara kuch programing bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha 
 The availability of Unix's high-level language implementation made its porting to various computer platforms easy
 computer enterprise maamle main pravesh karne se pehle kisi antitrust maamle ke kaaran, anti and tii ko oparating system ke strot code ko kisi bhi vyakti ko license dene kii aavashyaktaa thi
 As a result, Unix grew quickly and was widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses
 1984 main, anti and tii ne bel labs ko khud ko vibhajit kar diya; ni: shulk licencing kii aavashyaktaa vaale kanoonee daayitv se mukt, bel labs ne unics ko malikana utpaada ke rup main bechnaa shuru kiya, jahaan upyogkartaaon ko kanoonee rup se unics ko sanshodhit karne kii anumati nahin thi
 The GNU project, started in 1983 by Richard Stolman, aimed to create a "complete Unix-compatible software system" made entirely of free software
 1 9 84 main kaam shuru hua
 Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and in 1989 wrote the GNU General Public License
 1990 ke dashak ke aarambh tak, ek oparating system main aavashyak kai kaarykram, text editors, unics shail, or ek windog system) puraa ho gaye the, haalanki divaais driver, damon or karnel, jinhen jienyu / hard kaha jaataa he, nimna str ke tatwon ko roak diya gaya tha or adhuraa tha
 Linus Torvalds has stated that if the GNU kernel was available at that time, he would not have decided to write his own
 miniks kaa nirmaan computer vigyaan ke professor andrew es tanembam ne kiya tha, or 1987 main chaatro or anya logon ko lakshith unics jaise oparating system ke rup main jari kiya gaya tha jo oparating system ke siddhanton ko siikhnaa chaahate the
 Although the entire source code of MINIX was freely available, licensing terms prevented it from being free software until licensing changed in April 2000
 linaks kaa koi bhi aphis nahin he, koi bhi company yaa vyakti iskaa maalik nahin he
 But programmers around the world contribute to it
 duniya ke itihaas main isse bada, is prakaar kaa aandolan, kabhi nahin hua
 That too started by a US student from outside university

 Money cannot be used for Linux software, but this does not mean that it cannot be earned
 bahut sari companiyaan is par sarvice dekar paisa kama rahi hai or chal rahi hai
 The main ones are Red Hat and Sues
 linaks ke teen str hai - AT&T Had initially given Unix source code to the University of California, Barkley
 is vishvavidhyalay ne us par kaary kiya tathaa ise kaaphi aage badhaaya
 The university also derived its form which is famous as Barkley Souftower Distribution

 lekin uski kya sharte hai yah kisi ko maaloom nahin he
 At present, there are mainly five lawsuits related to Linux
 yah mukademen kyon chal rahe hai, iske bare main kai atakalein internet par hai
 The Caldera company previously used a distribution of Linux by the same name
 It was not very successful - at least not as much as Red Hat, Suce and Mandriva
 Caldara later went on to have a Santa Cruz operation

 Linus Torvald and companies related to Linux ran a case against him
 1997 May According to an agreement in this lawsuit, the trademark Linux name was given to Linus Torvald
 After that, Linus Torvald took the responsibility of managing the name LMI for the misuse of the Linux name
 Gave it to Lmi Linux gives the license to use the name

 The verb form of this word is to back up or gain additional support in two words and its noun form is backup or additional support
 mukhya rup se do prayojanon ke liye in byaapon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The first purpose is to re-establish the former position after destruction or disaster
 Another purpose is to restore some files that have been accidentally deleted or corrupted
 data kaa nuksaan hona bhi bahut aam baat he
 66% of Internet users have suffered severe loss of data
 chunki ek byaap system main seve karne yaa sahejane laayak sabhi data kii kam se kam ek prati rahati he, isliye data bhandaran kii kaaphi jarurat padati he
 Creating this storage space and managing the backup process is a complex undertaking
 bhandaran kii sanrachana taiyaar karne ke liye ek data ripogitary model kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 There are many different types of data storage devices available in this modern era of computing, which are used to backup
 aise kai vibhinn tareeke bhi uplabdh hai, jinka istemaal karke bhugolic atirekta, data suraksha or vahniyata kii suvidha pradaan karne ke liye in upkarnon ko vyavasthit kiya ja saktaa he
 The data is selected, filtered and manipulated before it is sent to its storage location
 byaap prakriya ko anukool banane ke liye kai vibhinn takneekein viksit kii gai hai
 Customizations to deal with open files and live data sources include compression or compression, encryption or encryption, and de-duplication or de-duplication

 It is also important to identify the limitations and human factors involved in any backup plan
 koi bhi byaap ranneeti ek data ripogitary kii ek avadharana ke saath shuru hoti he
 Backup data needs to be stored in some way and it should probably be organized to an extent
 It can be as simple as a sheet of paper containing a list of all the backup tapes and the dates on which they were prepared, or a more sophisticated one containing a computerized index, list, or relational database
 Can be setup
 vibhinn ripogitary modelon ke vibhinn phaayde hai
 It is closely related to a backup rotation scheme
 byaap kaa istemaal ek oparating system se duusare oparating system se instol karte samay bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Regardless of the repository model used, the data has to be stored somewhere in a data storage medium
 byaap ke liye istemaal kiye gaye data ripogitary model yaa data bhandaran madhyam kii parvaah kiye bina, abhigamyata, suraksha or laagat ke darmyaan ek santulan banaae rakhane kii jarurat he

 niyar-line tepe librari main bhejne se pehle data kaa manchan karne ke liye on-line discon kaa istemaal karnaa ek aam udhaaharan he
 a successful backup operation begins with the selection and removal of coherent units of data
 aadhunik computer systamon ke adhikansh data ko asatat ikaayiyon main sangrahit karke rakhaa jaataa he jise fil ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 These files are organized into filesystems
 jin filon ko sakriy rup se apadet kiya ja rahaa he, use "live" mana ja saktaa he jo byaap lene kii ek chunauti prastut karata he
 It is also useful for saving metadata that describes the computer or filesystem to be backed up
 ek nirdisht samay main kya byaap lenaa he, iskaa faisla karne kii prakriya usase kahin adhik mushkil he jitna mushkil yah dekhne main lagata he
 Backing up too much unnecessary data will fill the data repository very soon
 Backing up an insufficient amount of data can ultimately result in loss of important information
 agar ek computer system kaa upyog ho rahaa he jis samay iskaa byaap liya ja rahaa he, to padhane yaa likhane ke liye khole ja rahe filon kii sambhaavna vaastavik hoti he
 If a file is open, the contents of the disk may not display the file owner's intended content correctly
 yah vishesh rup se sabhi prakaar kii database filon ke liye sach he
 The term fuzzy backup can be used to describe a backup of live data that looks as if it is turned on correctly but never displays the state of the data at any time

 This is a list of English language words that are native to Indian languages or a list of English words originating from Indian languages
 Hindi is an indo-aryan language that evolved from the Sanskrit language, and is thus a much simpler version of it
 It is also called "standard Hindi" the language spoken in the northern belt of India
 Standard Hindi is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India
 English language took many words from Hindi Some of them are as: - 1)- Jungle:- and Indian word taken directly as it is pronounced with the same meaning " Forest" Both the language share the same meaning 2) - Juggernaut: - which is the name of Lord Krishna as he is worshiped in one of the 4 major Dham named jaggan Nath Puri in India
 It was taken with a different meaning a slightly different meaning
 First was a force which could ruin anything or ravage, devastate anything that comes in it's way
 Second meaning is a Blind devotion that needs cruel sacrifices in any form
 3)-bangalore :- To fire a worker because his or her job is getting outsourced to an offshore company overseas
 It's a City in India by the name Banglore, which was taken verbatim as a verb
 This city has most numbers of IT engineers and it started outsourcing American IT jobs
 4) -trignometry: - This is an argument that this word is taken from Indian word trikonmiti that stands for trignometry and is an ancient word found in sthapatya upveda one of the oldest books written in the world
 So it's but natural that it was the most ancient origin of this word
 But it might have migrated in other languages to move in English 5)- Bandana:- It comes from Indian word Bandhna that means to tie anything; a verb
 6) - Shampoo: - There is a Hindi verb chumpi which means a head massage with oil, a proper treatment of hypertension
 It results in a noun Chumpoo the one who gets such a message or as in a derogatory term one who used excessive oil on hairs or is fond of his hair
 It gives a very fashionable word in English which we can use freely
 7)- Sentry:- In Hindi as in Sanskrit Santri is prime minister of any state, one who is subordinate only to king and no one else, one who is advisory of the king and plans action of the state
 That word is called to derive the word sentry meaning a guard, especially a soldier posted at a given spot to prevent the passage of unauthorized persons
 8) - Aryan: - is derived from the Sanskrit 'arya'
 It is also present in Latin and Greek, but is believed to ultimately root from Sanskrit
 In the 18th century in Sanskrit, the word meant 'speaker of the North Indian language'
 In the 1830s Aryan was expanded to mean 'speaker of indo-european languages' since it was discovered that Iranians also used the same word for the same meaning
 In Nazi Germany, the main meaning of Aryan was considered to be 'non-jewish' and Aryans were recognized by features such as blonde hair and blue eyes
 Hindu religion today is only the leftover of the most ancient civilization of the world, note the word the most, Aryan
 Even Swami vivekanand did not want that religion to die uselessly therefore he founded an organization called Arya Samaj
 see http: / / en
wikipedia
org / wiki / Aryan for more information 9)-cheetah:- This is again taken as on base word
 It has the same meaning as Hindi word Cheetah Tiger
 10) - Chit: - This word is taken from Indian word Chitthi which means letter
 In english it means a short letter or a note by someone
 11)-bangles:- This is a form of Indian ornaments that are very famous in India
 you can see all the women wearing them
 and they are so long rooted in indian civilization that you can trace them in Indian rituals, traditions, and sacred customs too
 It comes from the word Bangdi with the same meaning a bracelet
 12) -juggernaut: - Something, such as a belief or an institution, that elicits blind and destructive devotion or to which people are ruthlessly sacrificed
from the name of the Hindu deity Krishna - Juggernath / Jaganath 13)-pariah :- a social outcast

 At the same time, the inspector investigating this suicide is also vulnerable to its bad effects
 udhar vaapis apane ghar main, prithvi ek or tasviir banaata he jisamen nandita par bheed hamalaa karti he
 He goes to the fashion show where Nandita performs, and is attacked by a ghost and attacks a spiritual master present on the show
 tab vah unheen panktiyon ko doharaati hui use kahati he ki, " tu ashuddh he, andar se sad chukaa he"
 Prithvi rushes to save her, but is stopped by the guards present there
 nandita ko us guru ji or darshakon se dur hataaya jaataa he
 After some time, an interview of Guru ji is shown on TV, which speaks of a phantom dominating Nandita
 vahiin sabakuch jaanane par, yash saarvajanik taur par sabase maafee maangata he, or bataata he asal main vah maansik samasyaon se pareshaan he
 On the other hand, after the Earth is released by the guards, Nandita again sees the phantom in the bathroom, which is again written in the same lines in the mirror
 vah prithvi se madad maangane jaati he, magar vahi usase inkaar karata he, yah tasviir dikhaate hue jisamen vah khud ko phaansi laga chuki he or uske najadik hi vahi samaan panktiyaan likhi hui he
 Then he also shows a clipping of the news in which the priest and David Cooper died, and the same lines were written behind them

 But even after reaching there, the ghost dominates him and, he injures himself and starts bleeding

 Prithvi tries to stop her but he realizes that Nandita is dominated by Phantom
 nandita khudkhushi kii bharsak koshish karti he magar aisa karne se prithvi use roak letaa he
 Yash then rushes and reaches Nandita in the arms of the earth
 yash tab nandita kii madad karne ko raji hota par is shart par ki vah prithvi kaa saath chhod de, magar vah uski madad lene se manaa kar detii he or prithvi ke saath chalane kaa nishchay karti he taaki kalindi jaakar is sach ko dhund sake
 That evening, Prithvi and Nandita spend the night in the guest house and leave the next morning

 Then they decide to go to the police inspector's house, where they find that they have gone completely mad and not worthy of stopping them from committing suicide
 aashaatheet saboot nahin milane par nandita va prithvi usee shaam vaapis lautate hai
 On the way, Nandita is seen committing suicide from the earth due to not being able to bear the consequences
 prithvi use aashwast karata he ki ve log milakar sachai dhund nikaalenge
 Just then, his car is stopped by a herd of cattle and a disturbed bull overturns his car
 nandita car se nikal padati he, prithvi nikalne kii purajor koshish karata he
 Then the same ghost leads him to the forest where he is again attacked in the sky
 phir use kai log pedo par latake dikhaai padate hai
 After this she finds herself at a well and sees that someone is standing near there, she moves towards him
 isi main vah kuen main kud jaati he, prithvi bhi uske peeche chalaang lagaataa he or pakad letaa he
 Knowing that the wall of the well is like a steep rock
 vahiin kuen ke bheetar, nandita jaan jaati he ki yah prithvi ke pita, vir pratap singh, hi he jo usapar haaavee hote rahe hai
 It all started when he came to know about the toxic waste discharged from the chemical factory of Kalindi into the river and where thousands of devotees arrive every year to bathe in the lake in this holy ritual

 According to the above definition, such resources consist mostly of bioresources in which restoration is done by biological processes
 udhaaharan ke liye ek van kshetra se vanopajon kaa maanav upyog van ko ek navikarniya sansaadhan banaata he kintu yadi un vanopajon kaa itani teji se dohan ho ki unke punarsthaapan kii dar se adhik ho jaae to van kaa kshay hone lagegaa
 Generally renewable energy resources are also included in renewable resources such as solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy etc
 kintu sahi arthon main ye urja sansaadhan akshay urja sansaadhan hai na ki navikarniya
 Forest areas produce a lot of human-friendly things that humans use from domestic operations to industrial production
 atah van ek mahatvapurn sansaadhan hai or chunki van main ped-paudhe prakritik rup se vruddhi karte hue apane ko punahsthapit kar sakate hai, yah navikarniya sansaadhan bhi hai

 dharmik shastron ke anusaar asadha shukla paksh main ekadshi tithi ko shankhaasur daitya maaraa gaya
 Therefore, starting from the same day, God sleeps in the Ksheer sea for four months and awakes on Kartik Shukla Ekadashi

 God covered the entire earth, sky and all directions in the first step
 agle pag main sampoorn swarg lok le liya
 In the third step, Bali sacrificed himself and asked him to keep his head on the head
 is prakaar ke daan se bhagwaan ne prasann hokar pataal lok kaa adhipati bana diya or kaha var maango
 Bali asked for the bridesmaid that Lord you stay in my palace constantly
 bali ke bandhan main bandhaa dekh unki bharya lakshmi ne bali ko bhai bana liya or bhagwaan se bali ko vachan se mukt karne kaa anurodh kiya

 In British culture, most traditional units start with a large number of counties which contain small divisions
 Within those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the county seat
 Some of the world's larger cities culturally, if not officially, span into multiple counties and those crossing state or provincial boundaries culturally are quite common as well, but are rarely incorporated within the same municipal government
 Many sister cities share a water boundary which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties
 For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as one large city, while locally they each are quite culturally different and occupy different counties
 Urban or Rural Division / Area: Indigenous: Sufficient gaps are found in the shabdawalis of these divisions in different parts of the world, due to which sometimes it is very difficult to be very accurate in Hindi translation from other languages

 He announced the Raman effect on February 28, 1928, after 7 years of tireless work and light-scattering from hundreds of liquids and solids
 1987 se bharat main yah din rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The Raman effect can be appropriately interpreted only on the basis of quantum theory, where a monochromatic light beam is seen as the flow of particles containing energy

 Every substance has its own specific spectrum as a tool of chemists
 atah padaarth ko nasht kiye bina mishranon kaa bhi rasinic vishleshan is takanic dwaara kiya ja saktaa tha or padaarth carbonic ho yaa acarbonic uske hastakshar raman spectrum main pahachaane ja sakate the
 Also the presence of their relative magnitude could be estimated by comparing the intensity of the spectral lines
 yah ek vyapak takanic thi or iskaa upyog dravon ke atirikt gaison or thoson ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 But after World War II, due to the developments in sensitive detectors and electronics, scientists began to find infrared spectrometry simpler than Raman spectrometry and the trend towards applications of Raman effect decreased somewhat
 kintu lesar kii khoj ke baad 1960 se raman prabhaav phir se vaigyanik anveshakon main lokapriy ho gaya
 The most difficult problem in detecting the Raman effect was that the Raman lines were very weak, so a very strong light source was required for their detection
 lesar ne na keval aisa atyant teevr prakaash strot pradaan kiya varan prakirnit prakaash main aise nae prabhaav pravartit kiye jinhone raman spectrummiti main nae aayam jod die
 As a result, many variations of Raman spectroscopy developed

 The Raman effect provides the most effective technique wherever a particle-specific particle can be identified and quickly extracted without damaging the sample
 abhinav raman spectrummiti ke kuch anuprayog neeche die gaye hai : The applications of Raman effect have been increasing with time and this shows the importance of the legacy of Raman effect in the 21st century
