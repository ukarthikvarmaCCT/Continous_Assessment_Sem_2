 Therefore, it is absolutely worthwhile to call it Yamuna Maiya in Braj
 bramh puraana main yamuna ke aadhyatmik swarup kaa spashtikaran karte hue vivaran prastut kiya he - "jo sristi kaa aadhaar he or jise lakshno se sachchidanand swarup kaha jaataa he, upanishdon ne jiskaa vramh rup se gayan kiya he, vahi paramtatv saakshaat yamuna he

 3 yamuna ke parambhakt iskaa dainik rup se prati din paath karte hai
 Devoted poets of Brajbhasha and especially the Vallabh Sampradaya poets, like Giriraj Govardhan, have also paid reverential respect to Yamuna
 is sampradaay kaa sayad hi koi kavi ho, jisane apni yamuna ke prati apni kavy - shradhanjali arpit na kii ho
 His Yamuna praise literature is a notable part of Brajbhasha devotional poetry
 yamuna kaa udgam sthaan himalay ke himachhadit shrang bandarpuchh 20,731oonchaai feet 7 se 8 mile uttar-pashchim main sthit kalind parvat he, jiske naam par yamuna ko kalindja athwa kalindi kaha jaataa he
 For several miles ahead of its origin, its stream is manifested by the Yamunotri mountain, flowing incoherently across vast hemigars and hummocked tendons and descending very steeply from the mountain slopes
 vahaan iske darshanath hajaaron shraddhalu yatri prativarsh bharat varsh ke kone-kone se pahonchte hai
 Coming out of the Yamunotri mountain, this river flows along the roaring gorge in many mountainous terrains and valleys, and moves along small mountainous rivers like Vadier, Kamalad, Vadri Aslaur and Tons in its zone
 uske baad yah himalay kaa daaman kaa chhod kar doon kii ghati main pravesh karti he
 From there it flows for several miles to the southwest and in the lap of small rivers called Giri, Sirmaur and Asha, it falls in the plain near Faizabad village in the present Saharanpur district, about 95 miles from its origin
 us samay iske tat tak kii oonchaai samudr sataha se lagbhag 1276 feet rah jaati he
 Where Yamuna is currently flowing in the field, it is not always flowing there
 puranic anushrutiyon or aitihaasik ullekhon se gyaat hota he, yadhyapi yamuna pichley hajaaron varsho se vidhman he, tathaapi iskaa pravaah samay samay par parivartit hota rahaa he
 Of the many places it has changed in its good life, only a few have been aware of it

 1 During the Krishna period, the flow of Yamuna was close to Katra Keshava Dev
 satrahavin shatabadi main bharat aane vaale europea vidwaan tevernear ne katra ke sameep kii bhoomi ko dekh kar yah anumaanit kiya tha ki vahaan kisi samay yamuna kii dhara thi
 In this context, Grouse is of the opinion that the Yamuna is less likely to flow near Katra in the historical period, but Yamuna was definitely there in the most ancient times
 2 isse bhi yah siddh hota he ki krishna kaal main yamuna kaa pravaah katra ke sameep hi tha
 Kannidham estimates, in the time of the Yannani writers, that the main stream of Yamuna or a large branch of it would flow under the eastern wall of Katra Keshav Dev
 3 jav mathura main buddha dharm kaa vyapak prachaar go gaya or yahan yamuna ke donon ore anek sandhaaram banaaye gayi, tav yamuna kii mukhya dhara katra se hatakar praayah usee sthaan par bahati hogi, jahaan vah ab he, kintu uski koi shakha athwa sahaayak nahin katra ke nikat bhi vidhman thi
 It is estimated that that branch of the Yamuna flowed under the Keshav Dev Temple until much later than the Buddhist period, possibly until the sixteenth century
 pahile do varasaati nadiyaan 'saraswati' or 'krishna ganga' mathura ke pashchimi bhaag main pravaahit hokar yamuna main girti thim, jinaki smriti main yamuna ke saraswati sangam or krishna ganga naamak dhaat hai
 It is possible that only one of those tributaries of Yamuna flows near Katra
 ballab sampradaay ke vaarta sahitya se gyaat hota he ki saraswat kalp main yamuna nadi jamunaavati gram ke sameep bahati thi
 At that time there were two streams of river Yamuna, one stream used to come near Nandgaon, Varsana, Sanket, on Jamunavati in Gobardhan and other stream went towards Pokhrat towards Gokul

 According to Kabeg's statement, he was a resident of village Parasauli on the banks of Jamuna and he composed his work in 1717
 6 At present, when coming to the ground near Faizabad village in Saharanpur district, it further separates Panjav's Ambala and Karnal districts of Haryana from the districts of Saharanpur and Muzaffar Nagar in Uttar Pradesh for 65 miles

 The Puranas have become famous on both sides of the route and the Upaban and Krishna Leela places are present
 yahan par yah bhant se vrindavan tak balkhaati hui bahati he or vrindaban ko yah teen ore se gher leti he
 It is known from the Puranas
 pracheen kaal main vrindaban main yamuna kii kai dharaayen thi, jinke kaaran vah lagbhag prayadweep sa ban gaya tha
 There were many beautiful blocks and grasslands in it, where Lord Krishna used to graze the cows of his fellow cowboys
 vartmaan kaal main yamuna kii ek hi dhara he or usee ke tat par vrindaban vasa hua he
 There in the Middle Ages many Dharmacharyas and devout poets preached Krishnopasana and Krishna Bhakti at the residence
 vrindaban main yamuna ke kinaaron par bade sundar ghat bane hue hai or un par anek mandir-devalayas, chhatariyaan or dharmashalas hai
 This enhances the beauty of the banks of the Yamuna
 vrindaban se aage dakshin kii ore bahati hui yah nadi mathura nagar main pravesh karti he
 Mathura is a historical and religious place situated on the banks of the Yamuna, whose long-standing glory story is famous

 Here too there are beautiful beautiful ghats on the banks of the Yamuna
 a panoramic view of Mathura city and its ghats can be seen from Yamuna in Manav or from a bridge
 Mathura has two concrete bridges over Yamuna, one on which the train runs and the other on road transport
 Let's go

 In the past, the Yamuna flowed in the form of a huge river in mathura-vrindaban, but since the canals have been drained from it, its aquifer size has reduced since then
 keval varsha ritu main yah apana purvavarti rup dhaaran kar leti he
 At that time, its water spreads for miles
 mathura se aage yamuna ke tat par baayin ore gokul or mahaban jaise dharmik sthal hai tathaa daanye tat par pahile aurangabad or uske baad farh jaise gram hai
 Even the banks of the Yamuna are sandy, but further along the rocky and muddy banks, from which the water stream flows in a panoramic form

 Here, the Yamuna has taken a big turn with force, making Bateshwar known as an island

 ye donon kisi samay main mathura ke pashchimi bhaag main pravaahit hokar yamuna main milti thim
 In present times they do not flow as rivers, but their residual forms are still present in Braj
 brajamandal kii in lupt nadiyon kaa jo vrittant uplabdh hota he, vah is prakaar he - In ancient times this river used to flow in Ambikaban near Mathura and meet in Yamuna at the place where the present day Gokarneshwar Mahadev is located

 ye dhaat ukt nadi ke naam tathaa kuch oonchaai se yamuna main girane ke kaaran uske tumuladhosh ke suchak hai
 At this time, instead of the existence of the said river, there is a drain, which flows in the rain

 There are major wells in Braj, which Brajwasis still use to get drinking water even today
 braj mandal ke adhikansh graamon kii aavsiy parishar main bhugarbheey jal khaari he athwa pine ke liye an upyogi he
 Therefore, in this context, the saying is prevalent that Lord Krishna made the terrestrial water in the residential premises of Braj villages salty and useful for drinking and drinking so that Braj gopis took their gagar and daily drinking water out of the village
 Get out to take and Krishna dances with them, break their gagars and perform leela with them

 Sahitya Darpan is a literary text written in Sanskrit, whose author is Pandit Vishwanath
 vishwanath kaa samay 14veen shatabdi tehraaya jaataa he
 Like the poetic light of Mammatt, Sahityaadarpan is also a major text of literature
 kavy ke shravy evam drishy donon prabhedon ke sambandh main is granth main vichaaron kii vistrut abhivyakti hui he
 Its division is in 10 paragraphs
 sahitya darpan 10 parichchhedon main vibhakt he: While presenting the poetic purpose, symptoms, etc
 in the first passage, the writer has refuted the poetic characteristic of Mammat "tadadoshau santo sargunavanalankriti re-qapi" and has presented the purest poetic characteristic of the symptomatic syntactic poetry presented by him
 purvamatkhandan evam swamtasthaapan kii yah puraani parampara he
 In the second passage, after describing the phrase and the phrase, the powers of the word - abhidha, symptom, and euphemism are discussed and classified
 tritiy pariched main ras-nishpatti kaa vivechan he or rasnirupan ke saath-saath isi pariched main nayak-nayika-bhed par bhi vichaar kiya gaya he
 In the fourth passage, the distinction of poetry is a discussion of acoustics and quality-satire
 pancham pariched main dhwani-siddhant ke virdohi sabhi maton kaa tarkpurna khandan or iskaa samarthan he
 The sixth passage is a representation of the topics related to the Natyashastra
 yah pariched sabase bada he or isamen lagbhag 300 karikas hai, jabaki sampoorn granth kii karika sankhya 760 he
 Defect formulation in the seventh passage
 ashtum pariched main teen gunon kaa vivechan
 Vaidarbhi, Gaudi, Panchali etc are considered in the ninth passage
 dasham pariched main alankaaron kaa sodaaharan nirupan he jinamein 12 shabdalankar, 70 arthalankar or raswat aadi kul 89 alankaar pariganit hai
 It has its own specialty - the sixth passage, in which all subjects related to the Natyasastra have been included in order
 sahitya darpan kaa yah sabase vistrut pariched he
 The main characteristic texts of Kaviprakash and Sanskrit literature do not have theatrical passages in the texts
 saath hi nayak-nayika-bhed aadi ke sambandh main bhi unamem vichaar nahin milte
 The third passage of the Sahitya Darpan also considers rasa nirupana as well as hero-heroine-distinction
 yah bhi is granth kii apni visheshta he
 Despite the tactical refutation of the views of the earlier masters, complexity like poetic light is not found in it
 drishy kavy kaa vivechan isamen naatyashaastra or dhanik ke dasharupak ke aadhaar par he
 Rasa, sound and virtuous satire have been discussed mostly on the basis of phonics and poetic light, and the Alankar episode is especially based on the "alankar Sarvasva" of Rajanaka Ruyak
 sambhavat: isiilie in aacharyon kaa matkhandan karte hue bhi granthkaar unhen apana upjivy maanata he tathaa unke prati aadar vyakt karata he - "ikshyalamupajijyamananaan manyanaa vyaakhyateshu katakshanikshepen" "mahataan sanstav evamgauravaay" aadi
 Poetry is also found in the literature mirror as being independent from its predecessors
 sahitya darpan se purvavarti granthon main kathith kavy lakshan kramash: vistrut hote gaye hai or chandralok tak aate-aate unka vistaar atyadhik ho gaya he, jo is kram se drashtavy he- In this way, the form of poetry gradually expanding has been tied up in a small form like "sentamasasamikavam Kavyam" by the philosopher
 keshav mishra ke alankarishekhar se vyakt hota he ki sahityadarpan kaa yah kavy lakshan acharya shauddhodani ke "kavyan rasadimad vaakyam shrurt sukhvisheshkrut" kaa parimarjeet evam sankshipt rup he
 Vishwanath has given a detailed and sangopang interpretation of the epic in Sahityadarpan - uparyukt vivaran se mahakavy sambandhi pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai- In this way, almost every philosopher has prescribed the characteristics of an epic based on the epics available in his time, but most modern thinkers consider Vishwanath's views to be authentic and in later epics, Vishwanath's view is considered more acceptable
 finnixchya rakhetun uthlaa mor marathi bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar jayant pavaar dwaara rachit ek kahani–sangrah he jiske liye unhen san 2012 main marathi bhashaa ke liye sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Temple Devasthan: In Hinduism, temples are of four major styles - dicillen ek acarbonic yogic he
 Sharang is the bow of the Hindu deity Lord Vishnu
 vishnu ke anya astr-shastron main sudarshan chakra, narayanastra, vaishnavastra, coumodaki gada va nandak talwaar sammilit hai
 This bow, along with Lord Shiva's bow and pinnacle, was prepared by Vishwakarma, a worldwide architect and manufacturer of weapons
 ek baar, bhagwaan brahma jaananaa chaahate the ki un donon main se behatar teerandaaj koun he, vishnu yaa shiv
 Then Brahma created a quarrel between the two, which led to a terrible duel
 unke is yuddh ke kaaran puure brahmad kaa santulan bighad gaya
 But soon Vishnu defeated Shiva with his arrows
 brahma ke saath anya sabhi devataaon ne un donon se yuddh ko rokane ke liye aagrah kiya or vishnu ko vijeta ghoshit kiya kyonki vah shiv ko parajeet karne main sakasham the
 Enraged Lord Shiva gave his bow to Pinaka to a king, who was the ancestor of Sita's father, King Janaka
 bhagwaan vishnu ne bhi aisa karne kaa nirnay kiya, or rishi richik ko apana dhanush shaarang de diya
 Over time, Sharang, the sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu and grandson of sage Hrishik, received Parashurama
 parashuram ne apane jivan ke uddeshy ko puraa karne ke pashchaat, vishnu ke agle avatar bhagwaan ram ko shaarang de diya
 Rama used it and gave it to Varuna, the god of the watershed
 mahabharat main, varun ne shaarang ko khandav-dahan ke dauraan bhagwaan krishna ko de diya
 Just before death, Krishna threw this bow into the ocean and returned it to Varuna
 vishnu ke aathven avatar bhagwaan krishna or rahasyamay shaktiyon ke rakshas shalve ke bich ek dwandvayuddh ke dauraan shaarang prakat hota he
 Shalva attacked Krishna's left hand leaving Sharang with Krishna's hands
 baad main, bhagwaan krishna ne sudarshan chakra se shalve ke sir ko dhad se alag kar diya
 According to another legend, when Janaka announced that whoever wanted to marry Sita would have to lift a divine bow called Pinaka and offer it to him
 ayodhya ke rajkumaar ram ne hi yah dhanush pratyanchit kiya or sita se vivaah kiya
 After his marriage, when his father Dasaratha was returning to Ayodhya with Rama, Parashurama blocked his path and challenged Rama to break Pinaka, the bow of his guru Shiva
 ram ne dhanush ko bhang kar diya 
 At this Dasharatha prayed to the sage Parashurama to forgive him but Parashurama was even more enraged and took Vishnu's bow Sharang and asked Rama to tie the bow and fight a duel with him
 ram ne vishnu ke dhanush shaarang ko liya, ise bandha, isamen ek baan lagaaya or us baan ko parashuram kii ore ingit kiya
 Rama then asked Parshuram what he would aim for the arrow
 is par, parashuram swayan ko apni rahasyamay urja se rahit maanate hai
 He realizes that Rama is the incarnation of Vishnu
 komaram bhim asifabad bharat ke telugana rajya kaa ek zila he
 Khat is the name of a raga of Indian music
 is raag main rishabh, dhaivat, nishad or shuddh or komal donon hi lagate hai
 Gandhara seems only gentle
 shadj va pancham ye donon swar achal hai
 The third vowel sounds medium and pure
 iskaa vaadi swar pancham or sanvaadi shadj he
 It also has a mixture of Asavari, Suha, Kanada, Sarang, Deshi, Gandhari and Sughrai Rag Raginis
 is kaaran iskaa gaan sahaj nahin kaha jaataa
 It has been called the son of Bhairava Raga and is lyrical in the morning

 International dark-sky Association) defines light pollution as: yah drushtikon kaaran or uske parinaam main tathaapi bhram paidaa kar detaa he
 Pollution has to involve light itself, which is analogous to the sound involved, carbon dioxide etc
 pratikul parinaam kai hai; unamem se kuch ke bare main ho saktaa he abhi tak jaankaree nahin hai
 The scientific definition thus includes the following: upar kii teen vaigyanik paribhaashaon main pehle do, paryaavaran kii sthiti kaa varnan karte hai
 The third describes the process of pollution by light
 prakaash pradooshan shahar main rahane vaale logon ke liye ratrikalin akaash main sitaron ko dhundhala kar detaa he, khagoleey vedhashalaon ke saath hastkshep karata he or pradooshan ke kisi bhi anya rup kii tarah paristhitiki tantra ko baadhit karata he or swasthya par pratikul asar daalata he
 Light pollution can be divided into two main types: annoying light that would otherwise interfere with natural or light lighting, and excessive light that is restless and adversely affects health
 1980 ke dashak kii shuruyaat se, ek vaishvik dark ski movement ubhara he jiske tahat chintit log prakaash pradooshan kii maatra ko kam karne ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai

 Like other forms of pollution, light pollution damages the environment
 urja sangrakshan ke pairokaron kaa tark he ki prakaash pradooshan ko samaaj kii aadaton ko badal kar sudhara janaa chahie, taaki roshni kaa adhik kushalta ke saath istemaal ho jisamen barbaadi kam ho or avaanchit yaa anaavashyak prakaash kaa nirmaan naa ho
 Many industry groups have also considered light pollution an important issue
 udhaaharan ke liye, united kingdom main institution of liting ejiniers apane sadasyon ko prakaash pradooshan or iske dwaara utpann samasyaon ke bare main jaankaree pradaan karata he or yah bhi bataata he ki ise kaise kam kiya ja sake
 Since not all are disturbed by the same light source, it is common that the light that would be "polluting" light for one person would be a desirable light for another person
 is kaa ek udhaaharan vigyaapan main miltaa he, jab ek vigyapandaata vishesh roshni ko ujjwal or spasht chahta he, bhale hi dusron ko isse pareshaani ho
 Other types of light pollution are more specific
 udhaaharan ke liye, vah prakaash jo galati se kisi kii sampatti seemaa ko paar karata he or padosi ko gussa dilaataa he aamtaur par vyarth or pradooshit prakaash hota he
 Disputes are still common when deciding the appropriate course of action, and differences in how much light is considered appropriate and who may be responsible mean that there should be occasional negotiations between the parties

 Light trespass occurs when unwanted light enters someone's property, for example by twinkling over a neighbor's fence
 a common light trespass problem occurs when an intense light from outside enters someone's home through a window and causes problems such as sleep deprivation or interception of the evening scene

 yah koi bhi prakaash ho saktaa he jise adhobindu ke upar 90 degree se zyada utsarjit kiya jaataa he
 By limiting the light to this 90 degree mark they have reduced the light output in the 80–90 degree range which causes most of the light trespass issues
 america sangheey agenciyaan bhi apane adhikaar kshetra ke andar maanakon or prakriya shikayaton ko lagu kar sakati hai
 For example, in case of light trespass exceeding the FAA minimum lighting requirements by the strobe lighting of communications towers, the Federal Communications Commission maintains an antenna structure registration database information that citizens can use to identify annoying constructions and consumer investigations And can provide a mechanism for processing complaints
 america green building council ne bhi apane paryaavaran anukool bhawan main ek maanak shaamil kiya he jise LEED kehete hai, jo prakaash atichaar or akaash pradipti ko kam karne ke liye ek akalan he
 Light trespass can be minimized by choosing light fixtures that limit the amount of light emitted more than 80 degrees above the midpoint
 IESNA paribhaasha main shaamil he purna katautee, katautee or ardh katautee 
 Excessive use of light is called over-twinkling

 Following is an excerpt from the article "electricity and English Songbird": akaash-pradipti, akaash or akaash main hi sitaron or akashgangaon ke bich viparyaas ko kam kar detaa he, jisase dhundhale vastuon kaa pataa lagaana adhik kathin ho jaataa he
 This is a factor that has led to new telescopes being built in remote areas

 Unfortunately this affects color perception, so they cannot be used to estimate the fractional brightness of stars, and no filter can match the effect of a dark sky for visual or photographic purposes
 Due to low surface brightness, the visibility of diffused sky objects such as galaxies and nebulae is more affected by light pollution than stars

 prakaash pradooshan ko kam karne kaa kai taatpary hota he, jaise ki akaash-pradipti ko kam karnaa, chamak ko kam karnaa, prakaash atichaar kam karnaa or avyavashtha ko kam karnaa
 The best way to reduce light pollution, so in a given environment depends on what the problem actually is
 sambhav samaadhaan main shaamil hai: The use of full-cut lighting fixtures, as much as possible, is advised by most campaigners for the reduction of light pollution
 saamaanya rup se yah bhi sifarish kii jaati he ki liton ko adhiktam dakshata ke liye uchit duuri par lagaana chahie or judanar ke bheetar lamp pratidwandvita naa karen
 Full-cut fixtures first became available in 1959 with General Electric's M100 fixtures
 ek purna katautee judanar, jab sahi dhang se sthapit kiya jaataa he, to prakaash dwaara kshaitij sataha se upar nikalne ke avasar kam ho jate hai
 The light that goes above the horizontal sometimes illuminates the intended target, but is often without purpose
 jab yah vayumandal main pravesh karata he, to yah prakaash akaash-pradipti main yogadan detaa he
 Some governments and organizations are now considering, or have already implemented, full-cut fixtures in street lamps and stadium lighting
 purna katautee judanar ke upyog se prakaash ko anaavashyak failane se rokte hue akaash-pradipti ko kam karne main madad mil sakati hai
 Full cut usually reduces the visibility of a lamp or reduces the visibility of the reflector within the lighting device, so the brightness effect can also be reduced
 prachaarak yah bhi aamtaur par tark dete hai ki purna katautee judanar or anya judanar kii tulana main adhik kushal hai, kyonki jo roshni anyathaa vaataavaran main fail jaati use isaki bajaay jameen kii ore nirdeshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Full cut fixtures, however, bind more light within the fixtures than other lighting equipment, reducing the efficiency of the equipment
 purna katautee judanar ke upyog se kam wat ke lamp ko judanar main istemaal karne kii anumati milti he, jisase samaan yaa kabhi-kabhi ek behatar prabhaav paidaa hota he, jiskaa kaaran he ki yah adhik dhyaan se niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 In every lighting system, reflected light from the ground also contributes to sky illumination
 is paravartan ko kam kiya ja saktaa he, tathaapi, lamp ke liye aavashyak uchit wat kshamta kaa upyog karte hue or liton ke bich main uchit duuri rakhte hue aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 a common criticism of full-cut light fixtures is that they are sometimes not as pleasing to look at
 aisa sambhavit rup se isliye hai kyonki aitihaasik drushti se vishesh rup se purna katautee judanar ke liye ek bada bazaar nahin rahaa he or kyonki log aam taur par roshni kaa strot dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 Due to its specificity with the direction of light, full cut fixtures sometimes require expertise to be installed for maximum effect
 prakaash pradooshan se nipatane ke liye purna katautee road lit kaa upyog karne kii asarkarita ko bhi prashn ke daayre main laayaa gaya he
 According to the design check, the distribution of full-cut lighting equipment must be close to meeting the same light level, uniformity and glare requirements specified by IESNA
 in anukaranon ne prakaash kii oonchai or duuri ko ishtatam kiya jabaki IESNA aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye samgr dizin ko simit kiya or uske baad kul aplit or urja khapat kii tulana alag-alag prakaash upkarnon kii dizin or shaktiyon se kii gai
 Cut designs performed better than full cut designs and semi cut designs outperformed cuts and full cuts
 isse pataa chalata he ki sadak pratishthanon main ati-jagamagaahat yaa purna katautee judanar dwaara utpann kharaab ekarupata, kamatar katautee yaa ardh-katautee judanar dwaara nirmit pratyaksh aplit kii tulana main adhik hanikaarak ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the overall performance of the current system can be improved by reducing the number of lighting equipment and not by making full cut design changes
 haalanki, kuch italvi kshetreey bill ke "prakaash pradooshan" kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue keval purna katautee dizin prakaash pradooshan ko rokte hai
 The Italian Lombardy region, where only full-cut design is allowed, was the lowest per capita in public lighting for lighting consumption in Italy in 2007: this information was verified using data released from the Terna company can go
 vahi kanoon, apni oonchai se chaar guna vaale street lamp ke bich kii nunatam duuri ko bhi lagu karti he, isliye purna katautee street lamp prakaash pradooshan or bijli ke upyog ko kam karne kaa sabase acha samaadhaan he
 There are many different types of light sources, each with different properties that affect its suitability in certain tasks and in particular the spectral power distribution and efficiency
 yah maamla aksar hota he ki ek kaam ke liye anuchit prakaash sroton ko chunaa jaataa he, yaa to agyanta ke kaaran yaa isliye ke sthapana ke samay adhik parishkrut prakaash strot uplabdh nahin the
 Therefore, poorly chosen light sources often unnecessarily contribute to light pollution and energy wastage
 prayukt prakash sroton kaa phir se akalan karke or unhen badal kar, urja upyog ko kam karnaa or pradooshan prabhaav ko rokna aksar sambhav ho jaataa he jabaki saath hi saath kushalta or drishyata main sudhaar ko kaaphi badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Some types of light sources are listed in the table below in order of energy efficiency
 kai khagolavidon kaa anurodh he ki aasapaas ke samudaay jitna sambhav ho halaki dabaav kii sodium roshni kaa zyada upyog karen, kyonki pramukh utsarjit tarangadairghy main tulanaatmak rup se kaam karnaa aasaan he
 The low cost of operating sodium lights is another feature
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1980 main san jose, california, ne sabhi sadak lamp ko kam dabaav sodium lamp se pratisthapit kar diya jiske prakaash ko lik vedhashala ke liye filter karnaa aasaan he
 Similar programs were launched in Hawaii and Arizona
 kam dabaav ke sodium prakaash kaa nuksaan yah he ki judanar ko pratispardhaa vaale judanar kii tulana main aam taur par bada hona chahie or rang pratishthit nahin kiya ja saktaa he mukhya rup se ek bhi utsarjan isaki tarang dairghy 
 135 w or 180 w prakaash utsarjan ke kam dabaav sodium prakaash upkaran se niyantran ke rup main is tarah ke ucch wat main vishesh rup se lamp ke paryaapt aakaar ke kaaran or adhik kathin hota he
 For applications that require more precise direction of light, high pressure is reduced compared to sodium lamps and can be lost altogether
 yah aarope ki isse bhi prakaash pradooshan kii maatra main ijapha hota he, in lamp ko chalaane vaale upkaran puraane upkarnon kii akushalta kii vajah se paidaa hote he mukhyatah parirakshan abhi bhi britain main upyog main vyapak rup se or kuch anya sthanon main kharaab he
 Consumption and reduced visible light pollution energy Modern low pressure sodium fixtures with superior optics and lack of shielding and full yellow light shielding have sky-illumination effects
 durbhaagya se, sateek jaankaree kii kami ke kaaran jari karne ke liye, kai prakaash peshewaron sodium jari rakhane kaa dabaav upeksha kam, upyog ke prakaash main yogadan karne ke liye vinirdesh apane main or giravat ai sweekruti maanakon or isliye apni
 kam dabaav ke sodium lamp kaa ek or nuksaan yah he ki kuch logon ko pili raushnee dikhne main apriy lagati he
 Because of light scattering by the atmosphere, different sources produce dramatically different amounts of sky-illumination
 kuch maamalon main, maujuuda yojanaon ke moolyankan ne nirdhaarit kiya he ki or adhik kushal prakaash vyavastha kii yojana sambhav he
 For example, light pollution can be reduced by turning off unnecessary outdoor lights and can only be reduced by stadiums lighting only when there are people inside
 The timer is especially valuable for this purpose
 is pradooshan ke pratikul prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye duniya kaa pehla samanvit vidhaayi prayaas america main flagstaff, erizona main shuru hua, adhyadesh ke vikaas ke dashak main teen jagah he, jansankhya purna samarthan ke saath, aksar samarthan sarkaar ke saath, samudaay ke adhivaktaaon ke saath, or vedhashalaon pramukh sthaneey ke saath madad se, jisamen america nausena vedhashala flagstaff stesan shaamil he
 Educating, conserving and enforcing each component intelligently helps reduce harmful light pollution
 prakaash yojana moolyankan kaa ek udhaaharan united kingdom main up pradhanmantri mul rup se kamishan dwaara karyaalay main ek report dekhi he or samudaay or sthaneey sarkaar vibhaag ke madhyam se ab uplabdh he
 The report details a scheme to be implemented across the UK to design lighting schemes in rural areas, with a particular focus on the protection of the environment
 ek anya udhaaharan main, calgary shahar main adhikansh awasaiya street liton ko adhik urja kushal prakaash se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he
 Motivation is mainly operating costs and environmental protection

 The Swiss Agency for Energy Efficiency uses a concept that has proven to be quite useful for road design diagnostics and promising, "conservation Electric Specific", which translates to English as specific power consumption

 Given the ongoing progress in the field of lighting technology, the target SEC values will need to be revised downwards from time to time
 prakaash pradooshan kii bhavishyavaanee karne or uske vibhinn pahaluon ko maapne ke liye ek nayaa tarika liting research technology patrika main varnit kiya gaya
 Scientists at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Lighting Research Center have developed a comprehensive method called Out Door Site Lighting Performance, which allows users to further optimize the design and performance of such applications and existing plans for lighting
 Least excessive or obtrusive lighting for the system, except for the boundaries of a property
 osps can be used immediately by lighting engineers, specifically to check brightness and trespass, and can help users compare multiple design lighting designs for the same site
 prakaash pradooshan ko kam karne ke prayaas main, shodhakartaaon ne "photometry kii ekikrut pranali" viksit kii he, jo yah tay karti he ki kitni maatra main or kis prakaar kii street lit kii aavashyaktaa he
 Integrated photometric system allows lighting fixtures to be designed to improve safety or improve the visibility of views while using less energy and safety
 There was a need to create a new system for night light measurement because the biological way in which the eye and cone process light differed in conditions versus daytime night conditions was needed
 bhamiti kii is nai pranali ke prayog se, haal ke adhyayanon ke parinaamon ne sanket diya he ki paramparaagat, pili, ucch dabaav sodium lit ko fluoroscent,, haliday dhaatu roshni yaa elidi ke saath pratisthapit karne se vastav main urja kii bachat hoti he, jabaki raat main drishyata main sudhaar bhi hota he
 The International Commission on Illumination, also known as CIE from its French title, Le Commissione Internationale de l'eclarez, will soon release its own integrated lighting measurement form for outdoor lighting

 Although the book is no longer in its original form, its composition has been set around the third century BCE, based on available translations

 Based on the available evidence, it can be said that when the work of this book was completed, he was about 80 years old

 Many people consider this book to be a powerful means of developing leadership
 is pustak kii mahatta isi se pratipaadit hoti hati he ki iskaa anuwaad vishwa kii lagbhag har bhashaa main ho chukaa he
 Panchatantra holds the first place in the fables
 panchatantr hi hitopadesh kii rachana kaa aadhaar he
 Narayan Pandit himself has accepted- vibhinn uplabdh anuwaadon ke aadhaar par isaki rachana teesri shatabdi ke aas-paas nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 In which period Panchatantra was composed, it cannot be said with certainty that the original copy of Panchatantra is not available yet
 kuch vidwaanon ne panchatantra ke rachayita evam panchatantra kii bhashaa style keadhar iske rachanakaal ke vishay main apane mat prastut kiye he
 According to Mahamahopadhyay Pt Sadasiva Shastri, the creator of Panchatantra was Vishnusharma and Vishnusharma was another name for Chanakya
 atah panchatantra kii rachana chandragupta maury ke samay main hi hui he or iskaa rachana kaal 300 i
pus
 mana ja saktaa he
 But westerners and some Indian scholars do not believe this, they say that Chanakya's second name was Vishnugupta, not Vishnusharma, and from the point of view of the available Panchatantra language, it seems to be a Gupta period
 mahamahopadhyaay pan durgaaprasad sharma ne vishnusharma kaa samay ashtamashtak ke madhya bhaag main mana he kyonki panchatantra ke pratham tantra main aathvin shatabdi ke damodar gupt dwaara rachit kuttinimat kii fparyghkah swastaranamya ityadi aryaa dekhi jaati he, atah yadi vishnusharma panchatantra ke rachayita the to ve ashtum shatak main hue honge
 But the composition of Panchatantra can not be considered in the eighth century only on the basis of the said verse, because this verse can also be projected in some version
 hartel or dow kith, isaki rachana 200 i
pus
 ke baad maanane ke paksh main he
 The influence of Chanakya's Arthashastra is also visible in the Panchatantra, on its basis also it can be said that the time of Chanakya is about the fourth century BCE, so the Panchatantra must have been composed before the third century
 is prakaar panchatantra kaa rachanakaal vishyak koi bhi mat purnataya sarvasammat nahin he
 Variant - Four versions of Panchatantra are available - pratham sanskaran mulgranth kaa pahalavi anuwaad he jo ab sirian evam arabi anuwaadon ke rup main praapt hota he
 The Panchatantra appears in the multiplied 'brihatkatha' as the second edition
 ‘brihatkatha kii rachana pashachi bhashaa main hui thi kintu iskaa mularoop nasht ho gaya he or kshemendrakrut ‘brihatkatha manjari' tathaa somdev likhit ‘kathasaritsagar’ usee ke anuwaad hai
 The third edition contains a collection of Tantrayakhika and related Jain stories
 ‘tantrakhyayika’ ko sarvaadhik pracheen mana jaataa he
 Its original place is Kashmir
 prasiddh german vidvan dow hartel ne atyant shram ke saath iske pramanik sanskaran ko khoj nikaala tha
 According to him, 'tantrayakhya' or Tantrakhya is the root of Panchatantra

 Similarly, the basis of the stories of Greek Greek and Arabian Nights of Arabia etc
 is the basis of Panchatantra
 aisa mana jaataa he ki panchatantra kaa lagbhag 50 vividh bhashaaon main ab tak anuwaad ho chukaa he or iske lagbhag 200 sanskaran bhi ho chuke he
 This is a sign of its popularity
 panchatantra main paanch tantra yaa vibhaag he
 The department has been called a system because it has given the methods of ethical governance
 ye tantra hai- mitrabhed, mitrasamprapti, kakolukkium, labdhpranash evam aparikshitkaarak
 In short, the content of these systems is as follows: nitikthaon main ek mukhya katha hoti he or usko pusht karne ke liye anek gaun kathaayen hoti hai usee prakaar ‘mitrabhed’ naamak is pratham tantra main angikatha ke purv dakshin main mahilaropya ke raja amarshakti kii katha di gai he jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki ve apane murkh putron ke liye kaaran chintit the or isliye ve vishnusharma naamak vidvan ko apane putron ko shikshit karne ke saunp dete he or vishnusharma unhen chah maas main hi kathaon ke madhyam se sushikshit karne main safal hote hai
 Thereafter, in the Angi-tale of the part called Mitrabheda, a wicked jackal describes the enmity of a bull named Sanjeevak with a lion named Pinglak whom Singh had saved from objections and even resisted his two ministers - Karkat and Damanak
 Had made my friend
 is tantra main anek prakaar kii shikshaayen di gai he jaise ki dhairya se vyakti kathin se kathin paristhiti kaa bhi saamana kar saktaa he atah praarabdh ke bighad jane par bhi dhairya kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie- In this system, how much happiness and joy one gets from the attainment of a friend is told through the story of Kapotaraj Chitragriva
 vipatti main mitra hi sahaayta karata he- It has been said that coming to a friend's house gives more happiness than heaven
 is prakaar is tantra kaa upadesh yah he ki upyogi mitra hi banane chahie jis prakaar kaua, kachua, hiran or chuha mitrataa ke bal par hi sukhi rahe
 In it, narrating war and treaty, the story of the cavities of owls being burned by crows is told
 isamen yah bataaya gaya he ki swarthsiddhi ke liye shatru ko bhi mitra bana lenaa chahie or baad main dhekha dekar use nasht kar dena chahie
 In this system, the crow befriends the owl and later sets the owl's fortress on fire
 isliye shatruon se saavdhan rahanaa chahie kyonki jo manushya aalasy main padakar svachhndata se badhate hue shatru or rog kii upeksha karata he- uske rokane kii cheshtaa nahin karata vah kramshah usee se maaraa jaataa he- This system has the main story of apes and crocodiles, and other interlude stories
