 He died there on May 5 in 1821
 nepolian bonapart ne 1799 main satta ko haathon main lekar apni sthiti sudrudh karne tathaa france ko prashasnic sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn kshetron main sudhaar kiye
 In fact, the Nepalese had taken over power by ending the rule of the directory and the people of France had accepted that change, then the reason was that it had grown from chaos and chaos
 atah nepolian ke liye yah jaruri tha ki vah aantarik kshetra main ek suvyavasthit shashan or kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana kare
 After becoming First Counsel, Napoleon created a new Constitution for France which was the fourth constitution of the Revolution era
 iske dwaara karypalika shakti teen kanusalaron main nihit kar di gai
 The Principal Counsel had more power than other Counselors
 vastav main samvidhan main ganatantr kaa dikhaaya to jarur tha lekin rajya kii sampoorn satta nepalian ke haathon main kendrit thi
 Napoleon centralized the governance and abolished the local governments of the Departments and Districts and appointed the prefects and sub-prefects
 inaki niyukti tathaa gaanv or shaharon ke sabhi meyaron kii niyukti sidhe kenndriya sarkaar dwaara kii jane lagi
 In this way, Napoleon, the administration's field, kept adequate control over these officers and kept the administration in order and appointed them on the basis of merit
 prashasnic kshetron main nepolian ke sudhaar ek prakaar se kranti ke virdohi ke rup main the kyonki neshnal essembali ne kranti ke dauraan prashasnic dhaanche kaa purna vikendrikaran kar diya tha tathaa desh kaa shashan chalaane kaa daayitv nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko diya gaya tha lekin nepalian ne is vyavastha ko ulat diya or krantipurv vyavastha ko phir se sthapit kiya
 From that point of view he was a laughingstock of revolution
 nepolian ne france kii jarjar aarthik sthiti se use ubaarane kaa praytn kiya
 In this sequence, he first simplified the tax system
 kar vasuulne kaa kaary kendriya karmchaariyon ke jimme kiya tathaa uski vasuuli sakhti se kii jane lagi
 He prohibited unfair profits in bribery, betting, contracting
 usne mitvyayita par bal diya or france kii janata par anek apratyaksh kar lagaae
 Napoleon established the Bank of France to carry out the financial activities in France, which still exists today
 rashtriya rin ko chukaane ke liye usne ek pruthak kosh kii bhi sthapana kii
 As far as possible Napoleon put the burden of military expenditure on the conquered territories and tried to keep the French people free from this burden
 nepolian ne krishi ke sudhaar par bhi bal diya or banjar or retile ilaake ko upjau banane kii yojana banaai
 Napoleon paid considerable attention to the means of transport for the development of trade
 sadaken, naharen banavaai gai vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon kii pragati ke liye yantric shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 To popularize French industrial goods, encouraged the exhibition and encouraged indigenous goods and industries
 berogari kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye nirmaan kaary ko protsaahan diya
 In this way Napoleon recovered France from a state of shabby and insolvency
 kintu aarthik sudhaaron kii drushti se bhi nepolian ke kaary kranti virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 In the Revolution, emphasis was placed on direct taxes, while Napoleon tried to establish an archaic system by emphasizing indirect taxes
 isi prakaar nepolian ne vanijyivaadee darshan ko praathamikta dekar krantivirdohi maansikta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He believed that the state would have to take active intervention to bring balance between the security of the fund and trade, whereas the force of revolution was on free trade
 nepalian aise nagarikon ko chahta tha jo uske evam uske tantra ke prati vishwaas rakhe
 For this, he made reforms by adopting national and secular forms of education
 shiksha ko praathmik, madhyamik or ucch staron par sangathit kiya
 These schools run with the help of teachers appointed by the government, used to have the same curriculum, the same textbooks and the same uniform
 nepolian ne paris main ek vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii or usamen latin, french, vigyaan, ganit ityadi vishyon kii shiksha di jaati thi
 This university was not a university in the general sense of the university, but made a system to unite all the institutions from primary to higher education
 shiksha par adhikadhik sarkari niyantran rakhana tathaa vidhyaarthiyon ko shashan ke prati nishthavan bananaa iskaa uddeshy tha
 Napoleon founded the Institute of France for research work
 nepolian kii nari shiksha main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 The burden of their education was left to religious institutions
 france kii bahusankhyak janata catholic carch ke prabhaav main thi
 During the revolution, the power of the church was weakened and brought under the kingdom
 carch kii sampati kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya or padariyon ko rajya kii vafadari kii shapath lene ko kaha gaya
 This angered the Pope and incited the general public to protest
 faltah sarkaar or aamajanata ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Napoleon made a pact with the Pope from 1801 called Concardate to overcome it
 uske nimnlikhit praavdhaan the
 Napoleon's most important and permanent work was the creation of the Code of Law
 vastutah kranti ke pehle france kii kanoon vyavastha chhin-bhinn thi or itane prakaar ke kanoon the ki kanoon kaa paalan karaane waalon ko bhi unka gyaan nahin tha or kranti ke dauraan bhi yah araajaktaa bad gai thi
 Napoleon overcame this chaos
 swayan nepolian apni vidhi samhita ko apane 40 yudhon se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 By this code Napoleon established the universal law system in France
 naagarik samhita ke tahat usne parivaar ke mukhiya kaa adhikaar sudrudh kiya
 Women are placed under men and the husband's job is to protect the wife
 talaak kii paddati ko kathin banaaya gaya
 Civil marriage was also arranged in this code
 is prakaar civil vivaah or talaak kii pratha ko manyata dekar nepolian ne europe main is baat kaa prachlan kiya ki bina padariyon ke sahyog ke bhi samaaj kaa kaam chal saktaa he
 Thus other codes such as the Code of Criminal Proc
 Etc
 were created
 uske vyapaarik code main shramjiviyon ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai thi or unke sanghon par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa gaya tha
 In this view Napoleon worked against the ideals of revolution
 iske baavjood is vidhi samhita kii mahatta samooche desh main kanoon kii ekarupata pradaan karne tathaa vyaavhaarik rup se nyaay vyavastha ko aasaan banane main thi
 This code was enforced wherever Napoleon's armies went and remained intact even after Napoleon's defeat
 yah nepolian kii ek sthaayee kirti he
 Napoleon's Code of Law emphasizes the interests of the bourgeoisie more
 bhoomi sambandhi adhikari ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyakti sampati kii raksha ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyaktigat sampati kii raksha ke liye kai kanoon banaae
 Creating a trade union was declared a crime
 mukademen kii sthiti main mazdooron kii daleelon ke badale maalikon kii baton ko nyaayalayon ko maanane ko kaha gaya
 Social equality is also the basis of the civil code
 visheshadhikaar or saamanti niyam kaa samhita main koi sthaan nahin tha
 There was not even a law to consider the elder son as the heir to the property, all the sons were given equal rights on the property
 nepolian ne samaaj main ek naveen kuleen varg kii sthapana kii
 He determined the order of titles according to income
 nepolian kaa yah kaary kranti ke aadarshon ke vipareet tha
 Napoleon's appearance on the European political horizon was like a wandering wheel and he soon became the destiny of Europe on the strength of his process and hard work
 usamen adbhut sainik tathaa prashasnic kshamta se sabhi kochakit kar diya
 But his pillar of strength was like standing on the sand wall
 jo kuch hi varshon main dhwast ho gaya vastut: nepolian kaa utthan or patan chakachaundh karne vaali ulka ke samaan hua
 He shone in the sky of Europe on the strength of military success, but with defeat, the star of his destiny sank
 jis samrajya kii kathin parishram ke pashchaat kaayam kiya gaya tha vah dekhte hi dekhte samaapt ho gaya uske patan ke anek kaaran the jo sa prakaar he
 Infinitely ambitious nepolian aseem mahatvakankshi tha
 The infinite great ambition proves to be the main cause of a person's downfall
 nepolian ke saath bhi yahi baat thi
 As the war progressed, his ambition increased and he began to dream of establishing a world state
 yadi thode se hi vah santusht ho jaataa or jite hue samrajya kii dekhbhaal karata or apana samay usamen lagaataa to use patan kaa durdasha nahin dekhnaa padataa
 Character weakness nepolian main saahas sanyam or dhairya kut- kut kar bharaa tha parantu uski drushti main ghrinaa uskaa pratishodh uskaa kartavya tathaa kshamaadaan kalank tha
 The great weakness of his character was that he did not consider the treaty to be a respected agreement
 kisi bhi desh kii maitri uske liye raajnneetik aavashyaktaa se adhik nahin thi
 Gradually he became stubborn
 He believed that every step of his was okay
 vah kabhi bhul nahin kar saktaa vah dusron kii salaah kii upeksha karne laga
 As a result, his true friends also went away from him
 nepolian kii vyavastha kaa sanyavad par aadhaarit hona- His political system was based on militarism which proved to be the primary cause of its downfall
 vah sabhi maamalon main sena par nirbhar rahata tha falat: vah hameshaa yuddh main hi ulajhaa rahaa
 He forgot that militarism can only be beneficial in times of crisis
 jab tak france vipattiyon ke badal chhaae rahe vahaan kii janata ne uskaa saath diya vipattiyon ke hatate hi janata ne uskaa saath dena chhod diya
 Losing the sympathy and love of the French public proved fatal to him
 uske atirikt parajeet raashtra uske shatru banate gaye jo avasar milte hi uske khilaaf uth khadey hue
 The historian Kabban has rightly written
 ‘nepolian kaa samrajya yuddh main panpa tha yuddh hi uske astitv kaa aadhaar tha or yuddh main hi uskaa ant hua
 ' doshapurn sainik vyavastha- Initially, the French army was steeped in the spirit of patriotism
 uske samaksh ek adarsh kaa or vah ek uddeshy kii purti ke liye yuddh karata tha
 But as his empire expanded, the national form of the army became legalized
 pehle uski sena main francisi sainik te parantu baad main usamen german italian purtegali or dach sainik shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a result, his army became the army of many states
 unke saamne koi adarsh or uddeshy nahin tha
 Hence, his military power continued to weaken and this proved to be an important reason for his downfall
 nausena kii durbalata- Napoleon had properly organized the army, but he lacked a powerful navy, which caused him to be defeated by England
 agar uske paas shaktishaalee nausena hoti to use england se parajeet nahin hona padataa
 Lack of patriotism in the conquered territories usne jin pradeshon par vijay praapt kii vahin kii janata ke hryday main uske prati sadbhaavna or prem nahin tha
 They hated Napoleon's rule
 jab uski shakti kamjor padane lagi to uske adhinsth rajya apni swatantraaa ke liye praytn karne lage
 The European nation formed a fourth bloc for the League against him and consequently was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo
 pope se shatruta- Due to the continental system, he made the Pope his enemy
 jab pope ne usee mahadwipiya vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya to usne april 1808 main rome par adhikaar kar liya
 And in 1809 AD, the Pope was imprisoned, leading Catholics to believe that Napoleon was the only demon destroying the freedoms of the states
 varanaa unka dharm nasht karne vaala bhi he
 industrial Revolution- kaha jaataa he ki uski paraaj waterlu ke maidan main na hokar manchester ke kaarkaanon or barkingdhan ke lohe ke bhadiyaan main hui
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, large-2 factories were opened in England and England became prosperous upon seeing it
 falat: vah apni sena kii aadhunik hatyar se sampann kar sakaa jo nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Continental system mahadwipiya vyavastha uski jabardast bhul thi
 He considered England as his biggest enemy
 england kii shakti kaa mukhya aadhaar nausena or vishwavyaapee vyapaar ta uski nausakti ko nepolian samaapt nahin kar sakaa isliye uske vyapaar par aghat karne kii cheshtaa kii gai
 For this purpose, he gave birth to the continental system, he issued an order that no country can do trade with England
 or na to england kii bani hui vastu kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 This was Napoleon's terrible mistake
 is vyavastha ne use ek aise jaal main fasaa diya jisase nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, the continental system is considered to be the main reason for its collapse
 purtegal ke saath yuddh – Purtigal had a commercial relationship with England, but Napoleon's pressure forced him to break ties with England
 isse purtegal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Therefore, he again established a commercial relationship with England
 isapar nepolian ne krodhit hokar purtegal par akraman kar diya
 This too proved fatal for Napoleon
 spain ke saath sangharsh- Napoleon's third mistake was his interference in Spain's internal affairs
 iske lakhon sainik maare gaye
 As a result, his position in this war became absolutely weak
 jisase uske virodhiyon ko protsaahan mila jab nepolian ne apane bhai ko spain kaa raja banaaya to vahaan ke nivasee us videshi ko raja maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 He drove Napoleon's army from Spain
 us vidroh se anya deshon ko bhi protsaahan mila or ve bhi vidroh karne lage jisase uskaa patan avashyambhavi ho gaya
 Russia's campaign nepolian ne rus par akraman kar baari bhul kii rus ne isaki mahadwipiya vyavastha ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Napoleon attacked Russia at this
 isamen yaddhapi masco par iskaa aadhikaar ho gaya lekin use mahaan kshati uthaani padi
 His opponents planned to attack
 ise akraman main use parajeet hona padaa
 Fatigue anek yuddh main lagaataar vyast rahane ke kaaran vah thak chukaa tha 50 sailaaniyon ne likhaa he nepolian ke patan kaa samast kaaran ek hi shabd thakaan main nihit he
 As he got entangled in the war, as his power weakened, he became tired and due to this his downfall became necessary
 sagesambandhi- His immediate relatives were no less responsible for his downfall
 halanki vah apane sambandhiyon ke prati udaartaa kaa bartaav karata tha
 But whenever he was in trouble, his relatives did not help him
 chaturthgut ke sanghathan- Taking advantage of the weakness of Napoleon, his enemies formed the fourth faction and the Allies defeated him
 use pakad kar salbai bheja gaya or use vahaan kaa swatantra shaasha banaaya gaya lekin nepolian vahaan bahut dinon tak nahin rah sakaa vah sheeghra hi france laut gaya or vahaan kaa shaasha ban baitha
 But this time he remained the emperor for only a hundred days
 mitra rashtron ne 18 june 1815 i
 ko waterlu ke yuddh main antim rup se parajeet kar diya
 The captured Allies sent him as a prisoner to an island called St
 Helena where he died in 1821, at the age of 52 years
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi kaaran pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se uske patan ke liye uttaradaayi the usne yuddh ke dwaara hi apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha or yudhon ke chalate hi uskaa patan bhi hua
 That is, those elements who built Napoleon's empire also destroyed them

 The reason behind this was its story

 Researchers at Citizen Kane say that Wells watched director John Ford's film Stagecoach forty times before producing the film
 wales ne khud apni diary main likhaa ki unhone stalecoch ko dekhakar or iske shots ke bare main takanicianon se sawaal poochkar-poochkar film nirmaan or nirdesan siikhaa
 Welles did not add the film's cameraman, Greg Toland, to his team, but Greg himself came to his office and expressed his desire to work
 greg kaa maananaa tha ki hollywood kaa koi bhi anbhavi nirdeshak unhen wo nahin karne detaa jo wo camla ke jariye karnaa chaahate the
 Greg got a chance and then Greg did an amazing job

 With this, when the microscope instruments developed, complex internal structures also became clear
 is sookshmdarsheey yantric adhyayan ko bhautikee kii sangya pradaan kii gai
 Therefore, in Bloom and Fawcett's words, 'under the body of microscopic or microscopic body comes the internal structure of the body which cannot be seen by naked eyes
 samast sajiv praaniyon kii sanrachanaatmak tathaa kriyaatmak ikai koshika hoti he
 The study of this cell is called cytology
 koshikaon ke punjon se utakon or utakon se angon kii rachana hoti hai
 The science that studies the structure of tissues is called physics and the science that studies the structure of organs is called body
 ootiki tathaa koshika vigyaan ke adhyayanon ke kaaran sharir ke durbhedya rahasyon kaa bhedan hota gaya
 Conducted studies of these two led to the development of optics-pathology
 san 1932 main nol evam raska ne electron sookshmdarshi kaa avishkaar kiya, jisase koshikaon tathaa utakon kii jatiltam saranchanaaon kaa spashtikaran hua
 Along with this, physiology also developed and new new mysteries were revealed
 is prakaar in teenon vigyaanon ke sammilit prayaas se jeevvaigyanik kshetra main abhootpurv kranti ai he
 Ecology and cytology mainly explain the morphological pattern of microstructures
 kintu jab se aneleen ranjakon kaa anveshan hua tab se koshikaon kii jatil sanrachanaon kaa bhi gyaan praapt hone laga he
 Today, hundreds of types of pigments are being used to shed light on microscopic structures
 is prakaar, ootiki ke kshetra main ab rasayanavigyaan kaa bhi pravesh ho gaya he
 Proper knowledge of chemical reactions of dyes is being gained by using regular stabilizers
 jeevadravya, koshika dravya tathaa unamem or koshikaon ke anek angakon kii rasinic sanrachanaon kaa gyaan ab sarsaadhaaran ke liye sulabh he
 How these organs perform specialized work is no longer unknown
 sookshm sanrachanaon kii rasinic prakruti ke adhyayan ko ootikirasayan yaa koshikarsayan kaha jaataa he or ab ootiki tathaa ootikirasayan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 According to Helen Dean, there are three major categories of such studies: beli kii ootiki vishay par likhi pustak main utak vigyaan ke saath hi koshika vaigyanik adhyayan par bhi bal diya gaya he
 According to Bailey, since histology is a structural study and complements the anatomical knowledge gained by dissection, it is also necessary to emphasize its close connection with physiology and pathology
 
 According to them, the basis of histology is cytoplasm or cytology
 uparyukt vivaran se yah prakat hota he ki koshikavigyaan tathaa oothkavigyaan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 Since cells are microscopic structures, we will study histology by considering histology to be synonymous with microtubules
 chunki utak koshikaon dwaara hi bane hote hai, at: ootiki kaa adhyayan ham koshikaon ke hi madhyam se karenge
 For proper study of tissues, it is necessary that they are treated by special methods before bringing them to the microscope
 utak kaa sookshm adhyayan karne ke liye yah anivaary he ki vah ati patala ho
 Many similarities are found in different parts of living tissue
 at: uskaa thik thik adhyayan sambhav nahin hota
 To overcome these difficulties, tissue is first dissected from 4 to 8 microns
 is kaary ke liye 'microtome' yantra kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Such microscopic rupture of living tissue is not possible unless it is stiff
 at: utak ko kadaa karne ke liye use vishesh prakaar ke rasayanon ke ghol main sthaayeekrut kiya jaataa he
 After immobilization, this tissue is treated and sterilized in various solutions of alcohols, stains and other chemicals
 ant main ise vishesh taap par pehle se hi galaakar taiyaar rakhaa jaataa he, daal diya jaataa he
 After some time, pieces of tissue along with wax are put into a quadrilateral mold
 jab mom jamkar kadaa ho jaataa he, to uske chote chote tukade kaat liye jate hai
 Finally these pieces are deposited in a special part of the microtome and several sections of special thickness are cut with a sharpened knife
 in sectionon ko kaanch kii pattiyon par rakhkar adhyayan ke liye rakh liya jaataa he
 Wax is dissolved by placing the glass strips on the heating plate and the section of tissue freezes on the glass strip
 in sectionon se ladi kaanch kii pattiyon ko vishesh rasayanon tathaa alcohol ke gholon main nirjal kar liya jaataa he
 It is then soaked in dilene or sedar ud oil
 ab yah section sookshm adhyayan ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Internal microscopes are used for microscopic study of these sections
 aajkal utakon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye is prakaar ke microscopon kaa atyadhik prayog hone laga he
 For this microscopic study, methods of thermodynamic and radiation autocorrelation are being used
 ootikirasayan ke antargat utakon ke vibhinn bhaagon kii rasinic sanrachana kaa adhyayan hota he
 The radiation autoregression method involves the insertion of special types of radioisotopes into the specialized tissue of living organisms
 is prakaar se upachaarikrut utakon ko jantusharir se baahar nikaalkar section bana liye jate hai
 By taking these sections in the dark room, they are captured by special chemicals of photography, or placed under the film and tied firmly
 kuch samay baad inhen andhere kaksh se baahar nikaalkar sthaayeekrut kar liya jaataa he
 Thereafter, they are studied by bringing them into the light
 utakon kaa adhyayan unki sookshm sanrachana kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, a brief mention of the structure of the tissue is necessary
 utakon kii sanrachana main teen prakaar ke mukhya ghatak dikhalaai dete hai : koshikaaye, matrix tathaa taral dravya
 The unit of tissue is a cell
 koshikaaye sajiv hoti hai tathaa ve sabhi kaary karti hai, jinhen sajiv praani karte hai
 Their shape is minimal and shape is spherical, oval, columnar, porous, flagellate, polygonal etc
 ye jelly jaisi ek vastu dwaara aavrutt hoti hai
 This coating is called cytoplasm or cell membrane
 ise kabhi-kabhi jeev-dravya-kala bhi kaha jaataa he
 The following structures are found within it: - cendrak evam kendrika Organism golgi sammishra yaa yantra Kanabha sutra antarpradravya dalika Chromosomes and genes rebosom tathaa centrosom Lavak matrix yaa aadhatri ko intercellular yaa ground sabstens bhi kaha jaataa he
 As is clear from the name itself, it is located in the central part of the cells and works to connect them together
 ye sajiv tathaa nirjeev donon prakaar kii hoti hai
 Ordinarily found in connective tissues
 yah tantu yaa reshon dwaara bani hoti he, jo teen prakaar ke hote hai : kolazanee, jalidaar tathaa elastic 
 It is a homogeneous or homogeneous material that lives in liquid or gelatin-like conditions
 yah upakalaa, koshikaon tathaa choti-choti shiraaon ke neeche jami rahati he
 It contains mucopolysaccharide acids
 aadhatri komal tathaa drudh donon prakaar kii hoti he
 Tissues also contain fluids, of which blood and lymph are the main ones
 ye donon aashyon athwa nalikaaon se hokar pravaahit hote hai
 Tissue keeps liquid cells moisturized
 adhatu ke hi kaaran sharir kaa swaroop bana rahata he
 The body of an animal is really nothing else, but a palace of intracellular matter or half, in which the bricks of billions of cells of many color forms and sizes are selected
 ye koshikaaye apane utpaadon kaa aadan pradaan karti hui apana jivan vyateet karti rahati hai
 Histology also gives proper information about the organs of the body
 angatantron kii saranchana, rasinic prakruti evam kaarividhiyon kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye utak vigyaan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 The mind is the ability of the brain that enables a person to have thinking power, memory, decision power, intelligence, emotion, sensibility, concentration, behavior, insight, etc
 saamaanya bhashaa main man sharir kaa vah hissaa yaa prakriya he jo kisi gyatavya ko grahan karne, sochane or samajhane kaa kaary karata he
 It is a function of the brain
 man or iske kaary karne ke vividh pahaluon kaa manovigyaan naamak gyaan kii shakha dwaara adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Mental health and psychiatry analyze the proper functioning of a person's mind
 manovishleshan naamak shakha man ke andar chuphi un jatiltaaon kaa udghaatan karne kii vidha he jo manorog athwa maansik swasthya main vyavdhaan kaa kaaran banate hai
 On the other hand, psychiatry is the mode of restoring mental health
 saamaajik manovigyaan kisi vyakti dwaara vibhinn saamaajik paristhitayon main uske maansik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karti he
 Education psychology studies all aspects that are influenced by a person's mental functions in education
 jiske dwaara sab kriyakalapo ko kriyanwruth kiya jaataa he
 It is called mind in ordinary language
 
 The psychologist named Freud classified the mind into three parts according to its design: frid ne kaary ke anusaar bhi man ko teen mukhya bhaagon main vargeekrut kiya he
 The main function of Ego is to develop reality, intelligence, consciousness, reason-power, memory-power, decision-power, will-power, adaptation, integration, tendency to distinguish
 chikitsa vigyaan kii ek mahatvapurn shakha jo ki manorogon ke upachaar, nidaan evam nivaaran se sambandh rakhti he
 But it does not work on every living being
 vigyaan kii vah shakha jisamen man kii saamaanya kriya kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Medical knowledge is not necessary for the training of psychologists, so psychologists often only support psychiatric investigations
 manorogon kii utpatti ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane kii ek vidhi jo kuch prakaar ke manorogon, jaise histyria aadi ke upachaar main bhi sahaayak hoti he
 For this, there should be knowledge of psychiatry or psychology
 man ek bhoomi maani jaati he, jisamen sankalp or vikalp nirantar uthte rahete hai
 Vivek shakti is used to distinguish good and bad
 vivekmarg athwa gyanmarg main man kaa nirodh kiya jaataa he, isaki paraakaashtha shunya main hoti he
 The mind is transformed in the path of devotion, its culmination is in the vision of God
 jeevatma or indriyon ke madhya gyaan man kaha jaataa he

 It is also known by the names of Wardha Yojana, Nai Talim, 'basic Education' and 'basic Education'
 gandhiji ne 23 oktober 1937 ko 'nayi talim' kii yojana banaayi jise rashtravyapee vyaavhaarik rup diya janaa tha
 Their educational ideas did not match the views of the academicians, so their ideas were initially opposed
 gandhiji ne kaha tha ki nayi talim kaa vichaar bharat ke liye unka antim evam sarvshereshth yogadan he
 Gandhiji's long brainstorming of ideas through active experiments for the exploration of truth and creation of the nation resulted in the emergence of a new training philosophy and process which not only gave India but a whole new human society

 On the contrary, today, Alam is that India is constantly moving under Western imperialism in terms of educational, social and economic terms
 aaj bharat kii adhikansh shiksha-vyavastha rajashrith athwa puunjipatiyon par ashrith he
 Most state-based educational institutions are dysfunctional due to lack of resources and discipline
 isliye gunvattta se yukt shiksha dene main asamarth hai
 Similarly, all educational institutions dependent on the capitalists are commercially active, which are out of the reach of the poor
 unamem sirf sampann logon ke bachche hi pard sakate hai

 In all, hardly anyone found Indian basic education
 yah baat nahin ki bhartiya shiksha denevaalon kaa abhaav he
 But because not all parents have the will and courage to give their children Indian education by abandoning the English education prescribed by governments or capitalists
 jab tak jansadharan kii is kaayartapurna maansikta main parivartan na kiya jaayegaa, tabatak nayi talim sahit koi bhi bhartiya shikshan-pranali is desh main punap nahin sakati
 Gandhiji presided over the 'all India Educational Conference' held in Wardha from 22–23 October 1937
 uske udghaatan bhaashan main gandhiji ne apane shikshadarshan ke mahatvapurn pahaluon par prakaash daalaa
 After that, many aspects of his 'nai Talim' scheme were openly discussed
 is charchaa main prasiddh gandhivadi shikshashasthri vinoba bhaave, kaaka kalelkar tathaa jakir hossain, sahit anek vidwaanon ne bhaag liya
 The following resolutions were passed on the last day of the conference- in prastaavon ke paarit ho jane ke baad dow jakir hossain kii adhyakshata main visheshgyon kii ek samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya jise in prastaavon ke aadhaar par vyaavhaarik paathyakram taiyaar karne kaa kaam diya gaya
 On the basis of these proposals, a national educational scheme was prepared which became famous as 'nai Talim', 'basic Education' or 'wardha Scheme' across the country

 Gandhiji considered basic education a means of social change
 ve ise shant saamaajik kranti kaa ek pramukh aadhaar maanate the
 He considered a major basis of social revolution by rebuilding the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the individual
 ve vyakti ke shaareerik, maansik tathaa aadhyatmik pakshon ke punarnirmaan dwaara saamaajik kranti laana chaahate the
 He considered self-confidence and self-reliance as the basis of complete development of human beings
 ve shiksha ko prayek vyakti kaa janmasiddh adhikaar maanate the
 That is why he considered it necessary to give free and compulsory education to all the boys and girls of the age group of seven to fourteen
 bhartiya rashtriya congress ke haripur adhiveshan main buniyadi rashtriya shiksha yojana kii sweekruti ke baad san 1938 se hi buniyadi shiksha main anek prayog aarambh ho gaye the kintu ve alag alag or simit str par kiye gaye
 The Second World War broke out in 1939, when another difficulty was present
 congress mantrimandal ko raajnneetik kaarnon se istipha dena padaa
 They were expected to be instrumental in the development of basic education
 kintu unke istife ke parinamswaroop, kuch praanton main prayog bilkul band kar die gaye or anya praanton main prayog ke prati udaseenta dikhaai dene lagi
 Only after independence, basic education was seriously accepted as the national method of education
 buniyadi shiksha nirantar pragati karti rahi he kyonki basic skulon kii sankhya baraabar badhati rahi he
 But there has been a decrease in the growth rate of the number of basic schools compared to ordinary elementary and middle schools
 basic skulon main pravesh kaa jahaan tak sambandh he sthiti santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 The goal was to provide basic education for all boys and girls in the age group of 6 to 14 years in basic education
 kintu pratham do yojanaon main koi mahatvapurn pragati is shiksha main nahin hui
 During this period, the progress of the spread of basic education was not as much as that of the promotion of ordinary elementary education, although the progress of simple elementary education is also not satisfactory
 adhyaaapak shikshan kii sthiti bhi bilkul santoshjanak nahin he
 The 1960 AD report of the First National Seminar on the Education of Elementary Teachers in India and the recent 1963 AD report of the Committee on Plan Projects regarding Teacher Training proves that there are many errors in the teacher training program
 isamen na keval uchit evam yogya karmchaariyon, bhawanon, upkarnon or anya sthool sadhano kii kami rahi he balki aparyaapt paathya vishay or shikshan kii prabhaavaheen vidhi tathaa style kaa bhi dosha rahaa he
 There is no clear definition of basic education by which people generally agree
 buniyadi shiksha ke vaastavik mul tatv evam nishchit lakshya ke sambandh main bahut hi gadabadi dikhaai detii he
 Gandhiji envisaged a certain social order while formulating the principles of basic education
 vah utpaadak kaary ko shiksha kaa centre maanate the kintu vaastavik prayog main utpaadak kaary dwaara shiksha ke siddhant ke bhinn bhinn arth ho gaye hai
 Some academics, who claim to be followers of Gandhiji, insist on the actual production of usable goods in schools
 kuch logon kaa mat he ki iskaa arth khel vidhi dwaara shiksha ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 The question of self-sufficiency in basic education is even more controversial
 gandhi ji aatmanirbharta ko shiksha kaa vaastavik maapdand samajhate the
 By self-sufficiency, he meant that basic schools should be self-sufficient to the extent that teachers' salaries could be paid by selling goods produced by children in schools
 isliye aarambh main buniyadi shiksha ke samarthakon kaa bahut bada varg is baat kii aashaa karne laga ki yadi buniyadi shiksha ke liye samuchit vaataavaran paidaa kiya jaae to iskaa adhik maatra main kharch nikal jayega or avshesh kharch sarkaar de degi jisase basic skool dakshatapurvak chal sakenge
 But from experience this conjecture proved to be wrong
 bharat sarkaar ke shiksha mantralay dwaara niyukt pieres-lakhni samiti ne is samasya kaa adhyayan kiya or bataaya ki 1950-1951 main bihar main, jo buniyadi shiksha kaa pramukh pradesh samajha jaataa tha, koi bhi vidhyalay 41
09 pratishat se adhik swaavlambee nahin tha
 The basic school of Sevagram, which was under the guidance and supervision of Hindustani Talimi Sangh, was self-supporting by 63 percent
 isanan is disha main basic vidyalayon kii suchi main sarvapratham sthaan praapt karne kaa gaurav praapt kiya tha
 In the year 1949-1950, 100 basic schools of Bihar state, including 18 senior basic schools, were able to be self-supporting only 15 percent
 tab se saadhaaran taur se, paristhiti main achchhai kii ore koi parivartan nahin dikhaai detaa he
 The evaluation committee appointed by the Government of India at the end of the first five-year plan for basic education also reached the same conclusion
 bharat sarkaar ne 'buniyadi shiksha kii sankalpana' sheershak pustika main swaavlamban kaa ullekh tak nahin kiya
 Even Vinoba Bhave, the great nutrient of the ideals of Gandhism, now has the idea that the benefit of the sale of the goods produced by children should not be used to reduce the reasonable expenditure on education, but it should be given to the parents by which they should get their To compensate for the loss caused by not being able to benefit from the help of your children at work
 aisa lagata he, sarkaar bhi siddhant rup se yah sweekaar karti he ki bacchon ke utpaadak kaaryan se praapt laabh unheen ke hit main kharch kiya jaae, jaise vidhyalay ke paridhaan yaa madhyanh ke bhojan ke prabandh par
 Therefore, it can be concluded that as per Gandhi's imagination, the cost of basic education cannot be reduced to a large extent by starting productive businesses in basic schools
 isliye buniyadi shiksha ko yadi desh bhar main praarambhik shiksha kii saarvbhaum paddati bananaa ho to iske liye prachur maatra main badhaai gai arthvyavastha aavashyak he
 The question of making basic education universal should be considered at the level of reality
 bharat ne samaajawaadee adarshavaale samaaj kii sthapana kaa sankalp kiya he
 One of the essentials of such a society is that all its members are well-educated so that they can contribute more and more to the common interest and properly benefit from the fruits of their combined efforts
 isliye kam se kam samay ke andar saarvbhaum, ni:shulk or anivaary shikshapradaan kaa prabandh sabase pehle hona chahie
 According to the 45th section of the constitution, by 1960 AD, the free and compulsory education of all children in the age of 14 years should have been arranged by the state
 yah ek vishaal samasya he or iske samaadhaan ke liye maanviya or bhautik donon prakaar ke mahan sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is estimated that if the country spends only two percent of its national income on elementary education, the necessary resources can be obtained in such a quantity that all the children of 14 years of age can get education facilities from 1980 to 1981
 ab yadi buniyadi shiksha sabhi bacchon ko di jaae to saarvbhaum shiksha ke str tak pahunchne main bahut adhik samay lagegaa
 Basic education is more expensive due to its high quality
 buniyadi shiksha kii rashtriya samiti dwaara niyukt sahaayak samiti kii siforeeshon se spasht he ki ek saadhaaran praarambhik vidhyalay ko basic skool main parivartit karne main kam se kam jitne sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he unhen dhyaan main rakhte hue praarambhik shiksha ke saath saath hi buniyadi shiksha kaa vikaas hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The need is that a visionary plan should be made according to which the expansion of basic education should be equal so that in the end it will develop into an improved method of elementary education at the national level
 kuch baaten jinke karne kii aavashyaktaa he, neeche prastaavit kii jaati hai : Basic schools working on traditional principles should be made true basic schools, at least fulfilling the mandatory conditions
 jin vidyalayon kaa purna vikaas nahin ho sakaa he unako adhik se adhik sahaayta deni chahie taaki ve adarsh basic skool ban saken or duusare unka anukaran karen
 Continue to expand the expansion of basic education
 saadhaaran vidyalayon ko basic skulon main badalen or nae basic skool kholen
 Most states may increase the number of basic schools by at least 5 percent per year
 basic skulon ke liye udyog chunate samay yah baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki udyog shaksha kii drushti se samrudh hon tathaa saamaajik vaataavaran or bacchon kii avasthaa ke anukool hon
 To prevent waste of raw materials, industry related work should not be done in the following categories of basic schools till the children are mature enough that they can use it profitably
 mitti kaa kaam, praarambhik bagwani yaa kuch kam kharchavaale haath ke kaam neeche kii kakshaon main karaae ja sakate hai
 There is a need to make changes in the curriculum of basic education on this basis
 sabhi praarambhik vidyalayon main buniyadi shiksha ke kuch tatv saraltapurvak apanaae ja sakate hai, jaise swasthya sambandhi kriyaayein, saamaajik seva ke kaarykram, saanskrithik kaaryaklap ityadi
 a school that has sufficient land and adequate irrigation facilities can undertake the production of fruits and vegetables
 yah aavashyak he ki jin vidyalayon main ye kriyaayein aarambh kii jaaen, unka bhalee bhanti niyojan kiya jaae or saath hi, unase puraa puraa shaikshik laabh uthaaya jaae
 Answer: The basic school should be considered as a branch of the multipurpose higher secondary school where emphasis should be placed on qualifying in the industry which a student has been pursuing from the basic school

 An ideal training school should be established in every district of each state

 The state institution of education established in each state should study and research various problems of basic education
 rashtriya shaikshanik anusandhan or prashikshan parishad ko rashtriya str ke mahatv vaali samasyaon kaa anusandhan karnaa chahie
 The research should make the methodology comprehensible and accessible to the teacher
