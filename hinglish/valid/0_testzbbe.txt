 bahut se vidyut yaa electronic ghatakon yaa avyavon ko jodakar vidyut paripath banate hai
 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series
 paripathon main bhinn prakaar ke avyav bhi shreneekram yaa samaantarkram main jude ho sakate hai udhaaharan ke liye diod kii raksha ke liye uske shreneekram main upyukt maan kaa fus laga diya jaataa he; yaa pankhe ko chaalu / band karne ke liye uske shreneekram main ek switch daalaa jaataa he
 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary
 samaantar kram main jude do yaa adhik 'do siron vaale' vidyut avyavon main sabhi ke siron ke bich vibhavaantar samaan hota he kintu inamen se hokar bahane vaali dhara alag-alag ho sakati he jo un avyavon ke pratirodh, prerakatv, dharita evam anya baton par nirbhar karti he

 Bimbisara Gautama Buddha was a contemporary and met with Buddha many times, influenced by Buddha, he embraced Buddhism
 jabaki jain va buddha donon saahitiyon main bimbisar ko unke dharm kaa anuyaayi bataaya gaya he
 According to the Buddhist text 'vinayapitaka', Bimbisara had declared his son Ajatashatru as crown prince, but Ajatashatru wished Bimbisara to attain the kingdom soon
 use aisa krity karne ke liye buddha ke chachere bhai 'devdatt' ne uksaaya tha or kai shadyantr rachaa tha
 According to the Jains text 'essential Sutras', Ajatashatru imprisoned his father Bimbisara in his desire to get a kingdom soon, where Queen Chellana supervised Bimbisara
 baad main jab ajatshatru ko pataa chalaa ki uske pita use bahut chaahaten hai or ve use yuvaraj niyukt kar chuken hai, to ajatshatru ne lohe kii danda le kar bimbisar kii bediyaan kaatane chalaa par bimbisar ne kisi anishth kii ashanka main jehar kha liya

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role
 anukulan kaa prakritik varan hi ek gyaat kaaran he, lekin kram-vikaas ke or bhi gyaat kaaran hai
 Other non-adaptive causes of micro-sequence evolution are mutation and genetic drift
 1842 main, charles darwin ne on da origin of spaciz kaa apana pehla sketch likhaa
 Main article: History of Evolutionism prastaav he ki ek prakaar kaa ek jeev duusare prakaar se utar saktaa he, kuch purv-secretic greek darshanikon jaise ki aneximundar or empodoclas main waapas jaataa he
 Such proposals survived into Roman times
 kavi or darshanik lucratius ne ampadocals ko apane masterwork di reram natura main dekha
 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types
 Give examples of life

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types

 The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still in view of species determined according to a divine plan
 is samay ke anya prakrutivaadee samay par prakritik kanoonon ke anusaar prajatiyon ke vikasvaadi parivartan par anumaan lagaate hai
 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents
 Is obtained

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians
 , Which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and was praised by Charles Darwin Did

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die
 prayek peedi main, kai santanon simit sansadhano kii vajah se prajnan kii umr tak jivit rahane main vifal rahete hai
 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms
 darwin ne 1838 ke baad se "prakritik chayan" ke siddhant ko viksit kiya or is vishay par apni "badi kitaab" ko likhnaa shuru kiya jab alfred rasel wales ne unhen lagbhag 1858 main usee siddhant kaa ek sanskaran bheja
 Their separate papers were presented together at the 1858 meeting of the London Society of London

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry
 kuch log is se pareshaan the kyonki yah nihit tha ki brahmad main manushyon kaa koi vishesh sthaan nahin tha
 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line
 hugo di vayiss ne verican ke rogaanu / som cell ke bhed ke liye darwin ke pengensis siddhant se judaa he or yah prastaav kiya he ki darwin ke penzen cell nabhik main kendrit the or jab vyakt kii gai to koshika sanrachana ko badalane ke liye ve koshika dravya main ja sakate the
 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline
 nae prakaaron kii utpatti ke bare main samajhane ke liye, di varis ne ek utparivartan siddhant viksit kiya jisane un logon ke bich ek asthaayee daraar paidaa kar liya, jinhone daravinian vikaas or biometricons ko sweekaar kiya tha jo de wills ke saath sambhddha the

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in genetic properties — inherited characteristics of an organism
 insaanon main, udhaaharan ke liye, ankhon kaa rang ek viraasat kii visheshta he or ek vyakti ko unke mata-pita main se "bhura-aankh ke lakshan" kaa uttaradhikari ho saktaa he
 Hereditary traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype
 ek jeev kii sanrachana or vyavhaar ko banane vaale anokhi lakshanon kaa puraa set use fanotip kaha jaataa he yah lakshan paryaavaran ke saath apane ginotip ke sampark se aate hai
 As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited

 Modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as change over time in this genetic variation

 Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, a common concept was combining inheritance
 lekin sammishran viraasat ke saath, anuvanshik bhinnata ko teji se kho diya jayega, prakritik chayan se vikaas asambhav he
 The Hardy – Weinberg theory explores how differences in population are maintained with Mendelian heritage
 alils ke aavritiyon chayan, utparivartan, pravaas or anuvaanshik bahaav kii anupasthiti main sthir rahegaa
 Diversity comes from mutations in the genome, altering genes through sexual reproduction and migration among populations

 However, relatively small differences in genotype can also lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differentiate in about 5% of their genomes
 mukhya lekh: utparivartan Repeat mutation of part of a chromosome is a change in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome
 jab utparivartan hote hai, ve ek jin ke utpaada ko badal sakate hai, yaa jin ko kaary karne se roak sakate hai, yaa iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a gene changes the protein produced by the gene, it will likely be harmful, with approximately 70% of these mutations having a harmful effect, and the remaining neutral or weak forms
 Beneficial from
 utparivartan ek gunasutra ke bade virgon ko doharaaya ja rahaa shaamil kar sakate hai, jo ek jin kii atirikt pratiyaan jinom main pesh kar sakate hai
 Additional copies of genes are a major source of raw materials needed for new genes to be developed
 yah mahatvapurn he kyonki adhikansh jin purv-maujuuda jin se jin pariwaron main viksit hote hai, jo saamaanya purvajon ko saajha karte hai
 For example, the human eye uses four genes to create structures that perceive light: three for color vision and one for night vision; All four descend from a single ancestral gene
 jab ek dupliket pratilipi ek nae fnction ko utparivartit or praapt karata he, to ek nae jin ko janajaatiy jin se utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Once the gene has been replicated, as this system increases redundancy, this process becomes easier; One gene in the pair may acquire a new function while the other copy continues its original function
 anya prakaar ke utparivartan, pehle gaiyr-koding diene se puri tarah se nae jin utpann kar sakate hai
 Generation of new genes can also replicate small portions of multiple genes, with these fragments being recombined to create new combinations with new functions
 jab nae jin ko purv-maujuuda bhaagon main pherbadal karne se ikattha kiya jaataa he, to domen saral swatantra kaaryon ke saath modul ke rup main kaary karata he, jo nae or jatil kaaryon ke saath nae sanyojanon kaa utpaadan karne ke liye milaayaa ja saktaa he
 For example, polyketed syntheses are large enzymes that make antibiotics; They are up to one hundred independent domains that each take one step in an overall process, such as one step in an assembly line adhik jaankaree: yon prajnan, anuvanshik punarsangyojan, or yon prajnan ke vikachalangik jeevon main, jin ko ek saath viraasat main mila he, yaa judaa hua he, kyonki ve prajnan ke dauraan anya jeevon ke jeenon ke saath mishrit nahin ho sakate
 In contrast, offspring of sexual organisms are produced through an independent mixture of chromosomes from their parents
 ek sambandhit prakriya main mutabik punarsangyojan kaha jaataa he, yon jeev do milan gunasutron ke bich diene kaa aadan-pradaan karte hai
 Recombination and recombination do not alter allele frequencies, but rather alleles giving rise to offspring are associated with each other with new combinations of alleles
 sex aamtaur par anuvanshik bhinnata ko badhaata he or vikaas kii dar main vruddhi kar saktaa he
 This diagram shows the dual cost of sex

 The twofold cost of sex was previously described by John Maynard Smith
 pehali laagat yah he ki langik rup se minu prajati main keval do lingon main se ek hi yuva ho saktaa he
 
 duusari laagat yah he ki jo bhi vyakti yon punarutpaadan karata he vah keval 50% jeenon se kisi bhi alag-alag santanon ko de saktaa he, saath hi har nae peedi ke paas
 Yet sexual reproduction between eukaryotes and multicellular organisms are more common means of reproduction
 red queen pariklpana kaa upyog ek yon-prajnan ke mahatv ko samajhane ke liye kiya gaya he, jo kabhi-kabhi badalte maahaul main anya prajatiyon ke saath sah-vikaas ke jawaab main lagaataar vikaas or anukulan ko sakasham karne ke saadhan ke rup main upyog karata he
 More information: gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and species
 isliye yah vividhta kaa ek strot ho saktaa he jo jansankhya yaa kisi prajati ke liye nayaa he jin pravaah jeevon kii alag-alag aabaadi ke bich ke vyaktiyon ke andolan ke kaaran ho saktaa he, kyonki antardeshiy or tateey aabaadi ke bich chuhon ke andolan yaa ghaas ke baari dhaatu sahishnu or baari dhaatu samvedansheel aabaadi ke bich paraag kii gati ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 Gene transfer between species involves the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer
 kshaitij jin transfar ek jeev se anuvanshik padaarthon ke sthanantaran ko duusare jeev main sthanantarit karata he jo ki iske vansh main nahin he; yah bacteria main sabase aam he
 In medicine, it contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, such that when a bacterium acquires resistance genes, it can rapidly transfer them to other species
 bacteria se jin ke kshaitij hastantaran jaise ki khamir Saccharomyces cerevisiae or adzuki been weevil Callosobruchus chinensis hua he
 An example of large-scale translocation is eukaryotic badeloid rotifers, which have received many genes from bacteria, fungi, and plants
 virus jeevon ke bich diene bhi le sakate hai, jaivik domen main bhi jeenon ke hastantaran kii anumati de sakate hai
 During the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria, large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between eukaryotic cells and the ancestors of bacteria
 yah sambhav he ki eukeriots swayan bacteria or orchia ke bich kshaitij jin sthaanantaran se utpann hue hai
 Mutation after natural selection results in populations with darker colors
 ek nav-darvinian pariprekshya se, vikaas tab hota he jab antarjaateey jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar alleles ke aavritiyon main parivartan hote hai
 For example, alleles become more common for blacks in a population of moths
 Mechanisms that can alter allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation, and gene flow
 mukhya lekh: prakritik varan Growth is the process through natural selection by which survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of the population
 ise aksar "aatmanirbhar" tantra kaha jaataa he kyonki yah jaruri he ki teen saral tathyon ke anusaar: Variations exist within the population of organisms in relation to morphology, physiology, and behavior

 adhik santanon kaa jivit rahane kii tulana main utpaadan kiya ja saktaa he, or ye sthitiyaan astitv or prajnan ke liye jeevon ke bich pratispardhaa kaa utpaadan karti hai
 As a result, fossils with properties that give them an advantage over their rivals are likely to pass on their properties to the next generation with properties that do not confer an advantage
 prakritik chayan kii mukhya avadharana ek jeev ke vikaas kii yogyata he
 Health is measured by its ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation
 haalanki, fitness santanon kii kul sankhya ke samaan nahin he: iske bajaay fitness ko baad kii pidiyon ke anupaat dwaara ingit kiya jaataa he jo kisi jeev ke jin ko lete hai
 For example, if an organism could survive well and breed quickly, but its descendants were too young and vulnerable to survive, this organism would have little genetic contribution to future generations and thus less There will be fitness
 yadi aleble us jin ke anya eliljon se adhik fitness badhaata he, to prayek peedi ke saath yah elil aabaadi ke bheetar adhik saamaanya ho jayega
 These symptoms are called "selected for"

 "importantly, the fitness of the allele is not a definitive feature; if changes in the environment, first neutral or harmful traits may be beneficial and the first beneficial properties become harmful
 haalanki, bhale hi chayan kii disha is tarah se ulat ho jaati he, ateet main kho gaye lakshan ek samaan rup main phir se viksit nahin ho sakate hai 
 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around
 yah, udhaaharan ke liye, kaaran jeev dhire-dhire sabhi ek hi oonchaai ban jaaenge
 a special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is the selection for any trait that enhances the success of sexual intercourse and the attractiveness of creatures of potential friends

 Natural selection can function at different levels of organization, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species
 chayan ek saath kai staron par kaary kar saktaa he
 An example of selection occurring below the level of an individual organism is a gene called transposons, which can replicate and spread across a genome

 Diplomatic history refers to the history of international relations between states

 The inclination of diplomatic history is mostly towards the history of diplomacy whereas international relations pay more attention to contemporary events
 rajnay ek kala he jise apana kar duniya ke rajya apane parsparik sambandhon ko badhaate hue apni hit sadhana karte hai
 After the well-defined goals of diplomacy and the efficient instruments set up for their achievement, the achievement of its desirable results depends on the means and methods that a state decides to adopt
 duusare rajya in sadhano ke aadhaar par hi rajnay ke vaastavik lakshyon kaa anumaan lagaate hai
 If there is inconsistency between the means and goals of diplomacy, then this weaken the country, discredit it and its international reputation falls
 is drushtir se prayek rajya ko aise saadhan apnaane chaiye jo duusare rajyon main uske prati sadbhaavna or vishwaas paidaa kar saken
 For this, it is necessary that the state should explain its policies clearly, recognize the just claims of other states and behave honestly
 beyimaani tathaa chalbaaji se kaam karne vaale rajanyajna alpakaaleen lakshyon main safalataa paa lete hai kintu kul milakar ve nuksaan main hi rahete hai
 In other states, there is distrust towards them and they become aware
 atah rajnay ke tareekon kaa mahatv he
 While deciding the means of diplomacy, it should be kept in mind that its main objective is to protect the principal interests of the state
 thik yahi uddeshy anya rajyon ke rajnay kaa bhi he
 Therefore, every diplomat should adopt a policy of mutual exchange
 prayek rajya ke rajanyagnon kii kam se kam tyaag dwaara adhik se adhik praapt karne kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he
 For this, agreement between the opposing interests is necessary
 samjhaute tathaa saudebaaji kaa yah niyam he ki kuch bhi praapt karne ke liye kuch na kuch dena padataa he
 This exchange is a practical truth of diplomacy

 Thus the conditions imposed by the concerned state are carried out only until it is compelled to do so and is relieved of their weight as soon as they get the opportunity

 yahan ham yunaan, rome, italy, france tathaa bharat main apanaae rajanyik aachaar ke tareekon kaa adhyayan karenge
 The history of diplomacy begins with the Greek city states
 plato tathaa arastu jaise raajnneetik darshanikon ne nagar rajyon kii raajnneetik sthiti evam anya rajyon se unke sambandhon ke bare main paryaapt likhaa he
 In the early phase of Greek civilization, the ambassadors of the city states were called precursors
 inkaa kaary keval sandhi vaarta karne tak hi simit nahin tha varan ye rajkeey gruhasthi ke sanchaalan, sabhaaon evam parishadon main vyavastha kii sthapana tathaa dharmik anushthanon ke sampaadan aadi kaa kaary bhi karte the
 With the development of Greek civilization, the relations of the city states became complex and competitive
 ab sandhi vaarta ke liye aise logon kii aavashyaktaa padi jo ojasvi tathaa prabhaavshaalee vaktaa hon, jinaki teevr samaran shakti evam buland aawaaj ho taaki ve duusare nagar rajyon kii lok sabhaaon ke sammukh apane nagar kaa drushtirakone prastut kar sake or uske paksh main joardaar pushtir kar sake
 On diplomatic posts, such a person was appointed who is a skilled speaker, a student of political relations and a psychologist
 prasiddh itihaaskaar thucydids ke vivaranon ko padhane se gyaat hota he ki us samay ke rajanyagnon kii vaktrutaayen paryaapt ojasvi tathaa sudeergh hua karti thi
 It has given details of a Lok Sabha of Sparta residents in which allies and friends were invited to decide whether the state of Athens had violated its treaties and if it did, would it be declared a war against it Should it be done? After the expiry of the statements in this assembly, the resolution of war was passed first on the basis of voice and then on the basis of counting
 ullekhneey baat yah thi ki isi samay sparta main athensvasi pratinidhi-mandal kisi vyapaarik sandhi ke sandarbh main aayaa hua tha or ukt sabha main nimantrit na hote hue bhi upasthit tha
 It was allowed to express its opinion in between
 jab yuddh vishyak prastaav paarit ho gaya to is pratinidhi mandal ke sadsy shatru rajya ke naagarik ban gayi, phir bhi inako us samay tak sparta main rahane diya gaya jab tak ki unhone apana sandhi-vishyak kaary puraa nahin kar liya
 The Greek diplomat used to perform these tasks - collecting related information in the welcoming state, adopting all methods in support of the interests of his state in front of the popular city assemblies, preparing occasional reports regarding the foreign state, of the citizens of his state in the foreign state Protecting interests etc
 us samay thucydids dwaara rajanyajna ke rup main sampann kiye gayi kaary hamaare adhyayan ke liye paryaapt upyogi hai
 He adopted negotiation and convention diplomacy to resolve disputes peacefully
 nagar rajyon main sparta tathaa athens pracheenatam the
 Good traditions of relations with other states developed here

 Here, residents are classified into three parts - slaves, foreign residents and citizens of Athens in terms of trade and seaside connectivity
 anya rajyon ke saath uske sampark kaa rup prajatantratmak tha
 The diplomacy here was influenced by trade, commerce and security requirements
 yunaan ke in nagar rajyon dwaara rajanyagnon ko anek unmuktiyaan evam visheshadhikaar saunpe jate the
 From the very beginning, the contribution of these diplomats in the creation of foreign relations was not only important but also extensive
 unani nagar rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon ne anek reeti rivaajon evam siddhanton ko janm diya
 At that time international law was in its infancy
 athens sparta evam thebs aadi nagaar rajyon ne aapasi sambandhon kaa vikaas apni aantarik niti, suvidha or suraksha sambandhi ranneeti ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya
 Modern religious treaties can be seen in the religious and political associations of the time

 Reports sent by self-styled ambassadors from abroad were widely considered in popular meetings of city states
 unke sujhaavo dwaara prastut samasyaon par vichaar karke aavashyak nirdesh diye jate the
 In the event of a dispute between the states, the tradition of its resolution by the Panch judgment had taken place
 anterrashtriya jivan ko niyamit karne kii drushtir se unaniyon dwaara viksit do prakriyaayen ullekhneey hai - The diplomatic behavior of Greek city states can be described briefly as follows- unani kaal ke rajnay kii aalochana karte hue kabhi-kabhi yah kaha jaataa he ki unani log anterrashtriya naitikta kii dharna se aparichit the jiske bina shreshth rajanyik yantra bhi nishkiray siddh hota he, ausatan unani kii nagar rajya ke prati swamibhakti itani gahari hoti thi ki vah anya nagar rajya vaasiyon ko apana sambhavit shatru or shesh asabhyon ko swaabhaavik das maanata tha
 Despite various notable notions of diplomatic relations, the diplomatic ethos of the Greeks was flawed in many respects - sankshep main, unaniyon ne rajanyik aachaar ke kshetra main kaaphi unnati kar lee thi
 The Romans were more barbaric than the Greeks
 atah ve intaraashtriya sambandhon kaa vikaas nahin kar sake
 The Greeks had developed the treaty negotiation system and expressed confidence in contacting opponents through the diplomatic process, but the Romans believed in military power more
 ve rajanyajna kii bajaay vijeta adhik the
 The Romanians relied more on direct action than on diplomatic methods
 unhone apni sarvocchata banaaye rakhane ke liye yah tarika apanaaya ki do yaa adhik rashtron ke bich sangharsh ke samay ve kamjor kaa paksh lete, kyanki unka vishwaas tha ki is niti se donon hi paksh rome ke raajnneetik anugrah ke aankakshi bane rahenge
 By taking the side of the weak, he will not only accept the influence of Rome, but when the powerful is overthrown by taking the side of the weak, then that powerful side will also be forced to consider the influence of Rome
 roman logon ne rajnay ke kshetra main yuddh kii vaidhaniktaa ke siddhanth kaa pratipaadan kiya jiske anusaar unki drushtir main vahi yuddh vaidhanik hota tha jisaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa kii gai ho or jiske liye ek vishesh dharm-guru dwaara dharmik samaaroh kaa aayojan kara liya gaya ho
 The Romans continued to welcome foreign politicians in both war and peace
 ve rajdoot ko saamanyatya lagetus kehete the or kabhi-kabhi fetial bhi kah dete the
 This word was often used with the interlocutor for war or peace
 roman seenet niyamit rup se videshon main apane desh ke rajdoot bhejti thi
 Roman law recognized ambassadors as trespassing
 vikhyath raajnneetik vichaarak siciro ne, jo rome main doot ban kar aayaa tha, is sambandh main likhaa he, “rajdooton kii anatikramyata divine tathaa maanviya donon hi kanoonon se he
 They are pious and austere so that they remain inflexible
 ye keval mitra rashtran main hi nahin he apitu shatru kii sena main dhire hone par bhi hai” roman kanoon ke antargat rajdoot ke sahyogi bhi anatikramya the
 The correspondence of the ambassadors and the items necessary for them were considered obsolete
 rajdoot jab kisi tisare rajya main se gujarata to bhi use anatikramya kaa visheshadhikaar praapt tha
 Any attack on the ambassador was considered a violation of Roman interstate law
 rajdoot par kshetreey-brahyata kaa siddhanth bhi lagu hota tha arthath koi samjhauta tode jane par rajdoot rajya ke nyaayalay main mukadmaa nahin chalaaya jaataa tha, vah sthaneey kanoonon se unmukt tha
 The Roman Senate used to treat ambassadors as state guests
 roman logon ne rajnay ke kshetra main ek prashikshit ‘puralekhpal’ kii paddati pradaan kii
 The archivists were proficient in diplomatic parables and procedures
 aaj bhi rajnay kii ek mahatvapurn shakha puraane lekhon, sindhyon, abhilekhon aadi kii raksha karnaa or unhen vyavasthit rakhana he
 The Roman people referred to work related to archives or articles as 'diplomatic practice'
 is prakaar ke lekhon ko vyavasthit rakhane kii paddati roman logon kii ek mahatvapurn dein he
 The Romans never respected the principle of equality of states
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki romanav logon ko apni sarvshereshthata main vishwaas tha, ve anya kisi rajya ko apane samakaksh nahin samajhate the
 This is the reason that in the Roman period, there was no development in the field of establishing diplomatic relations on the basis of equality and negotiation
 roman logon ne ek vishaal samrajya kii sthapana to kii lekin rajanyik bhaichaare ke aadhaar par anterrashtriya sambandhon ko viksit nahin kiya
 The Romans were almost unaffected by the basic elements of Greek civilization
 da0 shukradev prasad dube ne rajnay ke itihaas main apane adhyayan main pracheen roman rajanyik aachaar par prakaash daalate hue kaha he ki “roman vijayon ne jis vishwa rajya kaa nirmaan kiya, usamen parrthian, hindu or chini sabhyataaain hi aisi thi jo uski seemaa paridhi ke baahar thi
 Therefore, Rome did not require any special diplomatic legislation in this political environment
 uskaa kaam keval apni rajya seemaa ko barbar akramanon se surakshit rakhana tha, phir bhi roman samrajya ke vaideshik maamle kaaphi dilachasp the
 From the ancient times, whatever diplomatic dialogue was necessary on the circumstances of Rome's war and peace was entrusted to a specific diplomatic institution, namely the College of Fatalities
 roman dharna ke anusaar sabhi yuddh uchit the
 Before the war, the head of the Photialus College, called Patrus, informed the Senate that all diplomatic negotiations to find a peaceful solution proved fruitless
 yuddh prarambh karne ke nirnay ke uparant vah ek khooni bhaalaa shutra ke sthal par phankta tha
 This ritual was performed by taking an oath along with the call of Jupiter etc
 gods
 jab rome ke vistaar ke saath hi fitrelas kaa pratinidhitiv rajdoot karne lage to bhaalaa fankne kii aupchaarik pranali ne ek pratikaatmak swaroop le liya or shatru ke sthal ke sthaan par apana meetirs praan athwa beluna ke mandir k saamne phanka jane laga
 Fittilus was also given the task of establishing a treaty
 videshi rajdooton ko seenet se farvari ke maheene main capital ke nikat grecastirpesus ke avasar par pratyaksh vaarta karne kaa bhi avasar miltaa tha
 With the coming of the imperialist era, the emperor himself took up this task in his own hands
 rome dwaara kii gai sabhi sandhiyaan asmaan thi kyonki ve vijit pradeshon ke shaskaon par sadaiv ke liye thope di jaati thi
 The Jasentium of Rome, ie the legislation under which the legal principles were developed to cater to the foreign needs of Roman citizens, was not an international law in the true sense, although it also guided the relations which the Roman empire had with its neighbors
 Used to install from greek samskruti ke prati purna sammaan or nishtha rakhte hue bhi roman sagrajyavaadiyon ne greek-anterrashtriya samhita kaa anukaran nahin kiya
 The reason for this was obvious
 jahaan greek anterrashtriya vidhaan us samskruti ke swatantra rajyon ke parsparik sambandhon se utpann aavashyaktaa kii dein thi, vahaan roman sagrajya duusare deshon ke prati ek vistaaravaadi drushtirakone apana chukaa tha or shighratisheeghra vijit kar unka vilay apane samrajya main karnaa chahta tha arthath unka vishwa samrajya greek rajya vyavastha ke vighatan par hi sambhav tha
 The Roman Empire was a compilation of many castes and nationalities and where the central authority did not think it appropriate to give local nationalities any right to establish anything
 atah greek rajyon kii anterrashtriya pranali roman kootnithik paristhitiyon ke sarvatha pratikul thi
 The Roman Empire collapsed in 395 AD
 rome samrajya jiskaa kendra rome tha, chhin-bhinn ho gaya tab romanon ne kustuntuniya ko kendra maanakar vigentin samrajya kii sthapana kii
 Rude and wild castes resided around this empire
 apane samrajya kii raksha ke liye roman sainik shakti ke sthaan par yukti-shakti par vishwaas karne lage
 To keep those rude under control, he adopted three methods - jo jatiyaan isaai dharm ko na maanati thi, unamem isaai dharm kaa prachaar kar unhen isaai bananaa tha jisase ve gaiyr-isaai jatiyon se milakar samrajya par akraman na karen bigentin samraaton ne kabhi apane virodhiyon ko sangathit na hone diya
 He arranged for ambassadors for the success of his policy
 inkaa kaam tha swagatakarta rajya main vahaan kii aantarik paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan, mahatvakankshiyon evam durbalataaon kii jaankaree va unki suchnaayen samraat ko pahunchaana
 Thus the diplomatic ethos was changed
 ab rajdoot kaa kaary videsh main bhaashan dena hi na rahaa balki vah vahaan kii aantarik, aarthik evam saamaajik vyavastha kaa adhyayan karen or padosi rajyon kii durbalataaon se apane samraat ko prativedan dwaara avgat karaate rahen jisase samraat apni kaary-siddhi ko sahi rup main nirdhaarit kar sake
 While appointing the ambassadors, three qualities were taken special care of them - nickelson ke anusaar, “kushal vaktaa ke sthaan par rajdoot udghoshak tathaa prashikshit nireekshak rakhe gayi

 Within biology, conservation genetics and evolution have been broad fields in themselves, but these topics are more important to the practice and profession of biosafety
 there are advocates and there are sloppy or dishonest scientists, and these groups differ
 Is conservation biology a subjective science when biologists advocate an inherent value in nature? Do conservationists tend to favor policies when using qualitative descriptions such as natural habitat degradation, or healthy ecosystems? As all scientists hold value, so do conservation biologists
 sangrakshan jeev-vigyaani prakritik sansadhano ke tarksangat or uchit prabandhan ke liye pairvi karte hai or aisa ve apni sangrakshan prabandhan yojanaon main vigyaan, kaaran, tark or mulyon ke prakatit sangyojan ke saath karte hai

 He argues that the cost of searching, naming and mapping each species distribution is an erroneous conservation enterprise
 ve daleel dete hai ki prajatiyon kii paristhitik bhoomikaaon ke mahatv ko samajhnaa behatar hoga
 One way of identifying the biodiversity hotspots and the spatial centralization of coldspot genes, species and ecological systems is that they are not evenly distributed on the Earth's surface
 udhaaharan ke liye, " sanvahani paudhon kii sabhi prajatiyaan kaa 44% or chaar kasheruki samoohon kii sabhi prajatiyon kaa 35% prithvi ke bhu sataha ke keval 1

 " ve jo coldspot ke liye praathamiktaaon kii sthapana ke paksh main tark dete hai, unka kathan he ki jaev vividhta ke pare bhi vichararth kai anya upaay hai
 They point out that emphasizing hotspots reduces the importance of social and ecological relationships to vast areas of Earth's ecosystems, where biodiversity is dominated by biodiversity
 yah anumaan he ki jaev vividhta hotspot ke rup main arhata paane ke liye, prithvi kii sataha ke 36% main, jisamen duniya ke kasherukiyon kaa 38
9% shaamil he, sthanik prajatiyon kaa abhaav he
 In addition, the measure suggests that maximum protection for biodiversity does not lead to the acquisition of better ecosystem services than targeting irregularly selected areas
 jansankhya str jaev vividhta aise dar par gaayab ho rahe hai jo prajati str se das guna zyaada hai
 The literature highlights the level of importance of the solution of biodiversity versus endemics as a concern for bio-conservation that does not necessarily measure the level of threat of global ecological carbon reserves settling in endemic areas
 hotspot praathamikta drushtikon stepes, serengeti, arctic yaa tega jaise kshetron main itnaa baari nivesh nahin karegaa
 These areas contribute greatly to population-level biodiversity and ecosystem services, including cultural values and planetary nutrient rotation
 2006 IUCN laal suchi shreniyon ke saransh
 Those in favor of the hotspot approach indicate that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, are concentrated in endangered areas and therefore should receive maximum favorable protection
 IUCN laal suchi shreniyan, jo vikipedia prajatiyaan lekh main dekhi ja sakati hai, sakriy hotspot sangrakshan drushtikon kaa ek udhaaharan he; prajatiyaan jo sthanikmaari yaa durlabh nahin hai ve nune chintaa main soochibaddh hai or unke vikipedia lekh mahatv ke paimaane par bahut neeche anke gaye hai
 This is the hotspot approach as priority is set to target population level or species level concerns of biosimulation

 However, both sides agree that conservation of biodiversity is necessary to reduce the extinction rate and recognize the value inherent in nature; The controversy hinges on how to prioritize limited conservation resources in a more cost-effective manner

 The ecological credit crunch is a global challenge
 The Living Planet Report 2008 tells us that more than three quarters of the world's people live in nations that are ecological debtors - their national consumption has outstripped their country's biocapacity
 Thus, most of us are propping up our current lifestyles, and our economic growth, by drawing upon the ecological capital of other parts of the world

 Although direct market comparisons of natural capital are likely to be insufficient in terms of human values, a measurement of ecosystem services indicates the amount of contribution to be in the billions of dollars annually
