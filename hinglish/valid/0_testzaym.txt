 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static

 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 These plates are floating on the semicircular layer of the asthenosphere at the bottom and are generally moving at a speed of about 10–40 mm / yr, although some have a velocity of 160 mm / yr

 In plate tectonics, the word tectonics is derived from the Greek language τεκτονικός meaning to relate to construction

 The concept was first propagated in Europe by Austrian Edward Swoos

 The English philosopher Francis Bacon first marked this resemblance with the study of exact maps, with the cartographer Abraham Ortelius saying in 1596 that the Americas broke apart from Europe and Africa, and the German theologian Theodor Lilienthal's statement of Ortelius in 1756 Attempted to confirm on the basis of a biblical statement

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 Transform faults are found on their support

 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains
 udhaaharan ke liye alpine parvat tantra ke parvaton kii utpatti kii vyakhya ko prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea

 shwetarktata he rakt yaa asthi majja kaa karkat rog he
 It is characterized by abnormal polygenesis of blood cells, normally white blood cells
 shwetarktata ek vyapak shabd he jisamen rogon kii ek vistrut shrenee shaamil he
 In other forms, it is also a widespread part of the group of diseases known as hematologic tumors
 shwetarktata naidanik or rog vigyaan drushti se vibhinn vishaal samoohon main up-vibhajit he
 The first division is between fatal and long-term forms
 iske atirikt, prabhavit rakt koshika ke prakaar ke anusaar rogon ko up-vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 This division divides leukemia into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemia and myeloid or myelogenous leukemia: in do vargikarnon ko milakar chaar mukhya varg praapt hote hai: Myelogenous leukemia || Fatal myelogenous leukemia) || long term myelogenous leukemia) in mukhya virgon ke bheetar, vishisht rup se vibhinn up-varg hai
 Finally, hairy cell leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia are generally considered outside this classification scheme
 saamaanya asthi majja koshikaon ko ucch sankhyaon vaali aparipakv shwet rakt koshikaon ke dwaara visthapit karne par asthi majja ko hone vaale nuksaan se rakt ke thakka banane kii prakriya main mahatvapurn rakt bimbaanu main kami aati he
 This means that people with leukemia can easily get scratched, have excessive bleeding, or they may also have bleeding from pin pricks
 rogaanuon ke saath ladane vaali shwet rakt koshikaon ko dabaaya ja saktaa he yaa ve dushkriyasheel banaaya ja saktaa he
 This can make the patient's immune system unable to fight simple infections or start attacking other body cells
 chunki shwetarktata pratiraksha pranali ko saamaanya rup se kam karne nahin detaa he, iske kuch marijon ko aksar sankraman kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 It can range from tonsillitis infections, oral lesions or diarrhea to fatal pneumonia and periodic infections
 ant main, laal rakt koshikaon kii kami se anemia hota he, jo saans lene main kathinaayee or avarnataa utpann kar saktaa he
 Some patients may experience other symptoms
 in lakshanon main biimaar mahasoos karnaa, jaise kii bukhaar hona, thithuran, raat main pasinaa aana or flu ke saamaan anya lakshan yaa thakaan mahasoos hona shaamil ho sakate hai
 Some patients experience nausea or heaviness due to enlarged liver and spleen; This can result in an involuntary reduction in weight
 yadi shwetarktata se prabhavit koshika kendriya tantrika tantra par akraman karaati he, tab tantrika sambandhi lakshan utpann ho saktaa he
 All the symptoms associated with leukemia can be attributed to other diseases
 parinamswaroop, shwetarktata ke rog lakshan ko dekhakar uskaa upachaar hameshaa chikitsa jaanch ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Leucorrhoea literally means 'white blood', for this reason the disease has been given the name leukemia, in which a large number of white blood cells are found in the examination done before treatment in most patients
 jab rakt ke namoonay ko kisi sookshmdarshi main dekha jaataa he to badi sankhya main shwet rakt koshikaayen spasht rup se dikhaai detii he
 Often, these extra white blood cells are immature or dysfunctional
 koshikaon kii atyadhik sankhya anya koshikaon ke str main bhi baadha daal sakati he, jisase rakt ke pariman main ek nuksaandaayak asantulan utpann hota he
 In some patients, white blood cells do not show an overdose in some patients with leukemia at the time of regular blood count
 is durlabh sthiti ko aleukemia kaha jaataa he
 Cancerous white blood cells are now found in the bone marrow, which impedes the normal formation of blood cells
 haalanki, leukemia prabhavit koshikaayen rakt pravaah main shaamil hone ke badale main majja main hi pai jaati hai, jahaan ve rakt parikshan main dikhaai detii hai
 For a patient with alukemia, white blood cell numbers in the bloodstream may be normal or low
 aleukemia leukemia ke chaar pramukh prakaaron main se kisi main bhi ho saktaa he or yah khaas taur par royendaar koshika vaali leukemia main saamaanya rup se paayi jaati he
 There is no single known cause of all the different types of leukemia
 vibhinn leukemia ke sambhawatah alag-alag kaaran ho sakate hai
 Known causes include natural and artificial unregulated radiation, viruses found in humans such as human T-lymphotropic viruses, and certain chemical substances, particularly benzene and alkyl group chemotherapy agents for previous malignant tissue groups
 tambaakoo kaa seven vayaskon main ghaatak miloid leukemia viksit karne ke jokhim main vruddhi karne se sambandhit he
 Some cases of maternal-fetal transmission have been reported
 anya karkat kii tarah, leukemia, DNA ke shaareerik utparivartanon ke parinamswaroop utpann hota he jo onkogens ko sakriya karata he yaa tumor ko dabaane vaale jeenon ko niskriy karata he or koshika mrityu, vibhedikaran or vibhaajan ke niyantran main baadha daalata he
 These changes may occur spontaneously or may occur due to exposure to ionizing radiation or carcinogenic substances and may be influenced by genetic factors
 shodhakartaaon ke samooh or vishay niyantran adhyayanon ne petroracyanon jaise ki benzene or kesh rangane ke padaarthon ke saath sampark ko leukemia ke kuch roopon ke vikaas ke saath joda he
 Viruses have also been linked to some varieties of leukemia
 udhaaharan ke liye, ALL ke kuch maamle yaa to maanav pratirakshi nunata vishaanu yaa maanav T-limphotropic vishaanu dwaara janit sankraman se sambandhit hai
 However, one report suggests that exposure to certain germs may protect children to some degree from leukemia
 kuch logon main leukemia viksit hone kii anuvanshik pravriti hoti he
 This trend is reflected in family histories and paired studies
 prabhavit logon main sammilit rup se ek yaa ek se adhik jin ho sakate hai
 In some cases, families have a tendency to develop the same type of leukemia as other members; In other families, different types of leukemia or associated blood cancer may develop in the affected people
 in anuvanshik vishyon ke alaava gunasutra sambandhi asaamanyataon vaale yaa kuch anya anuvanshik sthitiyon vaale logon main leukemia kaa adhik se adhik khatra hota he
 For example, people affected by congenital pathology have a high risk of developing types of malignant leukemia
 phankoni anemia se ghaatak miloid leukemia hone kaa khatra hota he
 Studies have been done for decades to ascertain the causes of leukemia from non-ionized radiation
 antarrashtriya agency ne cancer visheshgy kaary samooh ke sambandh main anusandhan karne vaali prakritik rup se ghatit hone vaale or utpaadan, sanchaaran or vidyut shakti ke upyog ke sahyog se hone vaale sthir vidyut or atyant nimna aavriti vaali vidyutchumbakeey urja ke dwaara ekatrit kiye gaye sabhi aankadon kii vistrut samiksha kii
unhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki is baat ke bahut simit pramaan hai ki ucch str vaale ELF chumbakeey kshetra bachapan main hone vaali leukemia kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Children exposed to these high levels of magnetic fields may be at twice the risk of leukemia due to exposure to significant ELF magnetic fields
 haalanki report yah bhi batalaata he ki in adhyayanon main paae jane vaali paddatimulak kamajoriyon or purvagrahon ne sambhawatah badhaakar kahe jane kaa jokhim utpann kiya hai
 There has been no evidence of association with leukemia in adults or any other form of malignancy
 chunki elfs ke aise staron ke saath sampark apekshaakrit rup se asaamaanya he, vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne yah nishkarsh nikaalata he ki ELF ke saath sampark, yadi baad main kaaryakari siddh hua, to vishwa bhar main prativarsh aise sirf 100 se 2400 maamle hi honge, jo us varsh kii kul ghatana ke 0
2 se 4
95% jaahir karenge
 Until the cause of leukemia is detected, there is no way to prevent the disease
 kaarnon kaa pataa chal jane ke baad bhi, unhen tunrat niyantrit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki prakritik rup se hone vaale prishthika vikiran or isliye ve vishesh rup se rokthaam ke uddeshyon main sahaayak nahin hote hai
 Most types of leukemia are treated with pharmacological therapy
 kuch kaa upachaar vikiran chikitsa ke dwaara bhi kiya jaataa he
 In some cases, a bone marrow transplant is useful
 imatinib, jo ki ek tyrocine kinage inhibitor he, leukemia ke upachaar mai upyogi siddh hua he
 The management of ALL focuses on bone marrow control and systemic disease
 iske atirikt, upachaar ke dwaara leukemia se prabhavit koshikaon ko anya hisson, khaas kar kendriya tantrika tantra, jaise ki qamar sambandhi suraakh main failane se avashya rokna chahie
 saamaanya rup se, in sabhi upachaaron ko kai charnon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he Treatment decision Hematologists place CLL treatment based on both stage and individual patient's disease symptoms
 CLL marijon ke ek bade samooh main nimna koti kii beemaari hoti he, jisamen upachaar se laabh nahin hota he
 Individuals affected by CLL related complications or more advanced disease often benefit from treatment
 saamaanya rup se, upachaar ke bindu is prakaar hai: The specific treatment method CLL is probably incurable by current treatments
 praathmik taur par chemotherapy sambandhi upachaar main sangyojan chemotherapy ke saath chlorambusil yaa saichlophosphomide or saath hi saath ek corticosteroid jaise ki prednison yaa prednisolon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The use of a corticosteroid has the added advantage of suppressing certain related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immuno-mediated thrombocytopenia
 In immune situations, nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful agents of single treatment
 
 yuva marij anuvaanshik rup se bhinn yaa apane sharir se hi autologs asthi majja ke pratyaropan ke bare main vichaar kar sakate hai
 Many different cancer-resistant drugs are effective for the treatment of AML
 marij kii umr ke anusaar or AML ke vishesh upsvarupon ke anusaar upachaar alag-alag hote hai
 Overall, the strategy is to prevent bone marrow-related and systemic disease, while specific treatment of the central nervous system if ingested
 saamaanya rup se, adhikansh karkat rog visheshgy chemotherapy ke aarambhik preran charan ke liye aushadhiyon ke sammishran par bharosa karte hai
 Such blending chemotherapies generally provide the benefit of early reduction in bone marrow deposition and lower risk of resistance to disease
 asthi majja main ghanibhutikaran or dekh-rekh sambandhi upachaaron kaa uddeshy beemaari kii punrariti ko rokna he
 In addition to frequent chemotherapy, intensive chemotherapy with drugs is unavoidable for the treatment of condensation in the bone marrow
 iske vipareet, dekh-rekh sambandhi upachaar main aushadhiyon kii vah khuraaq di jaati he jo preran charan ke dauraan prayukt hoti he
 There are many possible treatments for CML, but standard care is imatinib therapy to diagnose new patients by observing disease symptoms
 adhikansh karkat pratirodhi aushadhiyon kii tulana main, iske apekshaakrit rup se kam parshv prabhaav hote hai or inhen gharon main maukhik rup se khaaya ja saktaa he
 With this drug, more than 90% of patients will be able to control the disease for at least five years, so that CML will become a long-term, controllable condition
 adhik badi hui or aniyantrit sthiti main, jab rogi imetinib sahan nahin kar saktaa he, yaa yadi rogi ek sthaayee upachaar kii ichha vyakt karata he, to anuvanshik rup se bhinn asthi majja pratyaropan kiya ja saktaa he
 This procedure involves high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy as well as infusion of the bone marrow from a compatible donor
 lagbhag 30% rogi is prakriya main mar jate hai
 Treatment decision: Patients affected by leukemia with no hair, no symptoms of this disease, are not treated as soon as possible
 upachaar par vichaar karnaa aamtaur par tabhi aavashyak samajha jaataa he jab marij main is rog ke sanket or lakshan jaise ki rakt koshika ki sankhyaon main kami se kam, aksar sankraman, akthith kharonch, anemia, yaa thakaan mahasoos hona jo marij ke dainik jivan ko baadhit karne ke liye paryaapt ho
 Specific treatment method Patients who require treatment are usually given pantostatin daily for up to four weeks by either cladribine or intravenous infusion within the skin by either intravenous infusion or normal injection into the skin
 
 adhikansh sthitiyon main, upachaar ke ek daur se dirghakaalin raahat milegaa
 Other treatments include intravenous infusion of rituzimab or self-injection of interferon-alpha
 simit sthitiyon main, rogi ko shalya-kriya dwaara pleeha nikaale jane kii kriya se laabh pahunch saktaa he
 These treatments are not typically offered as first treatments because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pantostatin
 tii-cell prolimphosaitic leukemia, jo ki ek viral or teji se failanevaali leukemia he or jisamen jivit rahane kii dar kaa ausat ek varsh se bhi kam hoti he, ke adhikansh marijon ko atisheeghra upachaar kii zarurat hoti he
 T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is difficult to treat and is not compatible with most available chemotherapy drugs
 kuch rogiyon main simit safalataa ke saath anek vibhinn prakaar ke upachaaron ke prayaas kiye ja chuke hai: purine samadharmi, chlorambusil or sammishran chemotherapy ke vibhinn prakaar 
 shwet rakt koshikaon par akraman karne vaale alemtuzumaib ek ekal-praturup pratirakshi kaa prayog upachaar main pichley vikalpon kii apeksha adhik badi safalataa ke saath kiya gaya he
 Some patients who successfully demonstrate compatibility with this treatment also have cell tube transplantation to reinforce the compatibility
 leukemia ke kaarnon, nidaan, upachaar or roganidan ke sambandh main mahatvapurn anusandhan kiye ja rahe hai
 Hundreds of clinical investigations are being planned or are being done from time to time
 marijon kii jivan style main sudhaar karte hue, yaa asthi majja ke jamaav main kami laane main yaa upachaar ke baad uchit dekhbhaal karte hue, adhyayan upachaar ke prabhavi sadhano, is beemaari ke ilaaj ke behatar tareekon par dhyaan kendrit karegaa

 jonraj 15veen sadi ke ek kashmiri itihaaskaar or sanskrit kavi the
 He wrote a history book titled 'second Rajatarangini', in which he continued the narration of Kalhan's Rajatarangini till 1149, even to his contemporary Sultan zain-ul-abidin
 bud shah kaa raaj san 1423 se 1474 tak chalaa lekin jonraj unke shasankaal kaa puraa bakhaan nahin likh paae kyonki unke raajkaal ke 35wein varsh main hi jonraj kaa dehanth ho gaya

 myanmar lipi yaa burmi lipi, burmi bhashaa likhane ke liye prayukt hoti he
 It is the script of the Brahmi family
 iske akshar gol hote hai jo taadptr par lekhan main suvidha pradaan karte the kyonki sidhi rekhaayen likhane se patton ke fatne kaa dar rahata he
 The Burmese script is derived from the Brahmi script but there is a lot of difference in the spelling and pronunciation of some words
 udhaaharan ke liye, Here अर्थ does not mean actual immersion, rather it means to increase the corresponding quantity
 There are several diactric marks that alter the vowel sound of a letter
 Two diacritics are used exclusively for Pali and are rarely seen elsewhere
 One or more of these accents can be added to a consonant to change its sound
 In addition, other modifying symbols are used to differentiate tone and sound, but are not considered diacritics
 burmi lipi ke romaneekaran kii chaar pranaliyaan prachlit hai
 Two of these systems can be called transliteration and the other two are stressed with pronunciation, so they can be called transcription
 lipyantaran kii pranaliyaan hai- MLC Transcription System tathaa ALA-LC Romanization bhi dekhen
 Transcription systems are BGN / PCGN romanization and the system used by John Okell
 in pranaaliyon kaa vistrut vivechan neeche kii saraniyon main diya gaya he- The romanization of syllable onsets is done as follows- Syllable rhymes kaa romaneekaran nimnavat kiya jaataa he
 In this table the Burmese character 'A' က: ipachar has been used as the basis
 In sequences with ွ or ဝ before တ်, န်, ပ်, မ် or together with ံ, the vowel pronounced is saanchaa:ipachar rather than the expected saanchaa:ipachar
 This is reflected in the BGN / PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 The independent vowel letters are transcribed the same as the vowels formed with အ, except in ALA-LC, where those formed with အ take a preposed apostrophe: The low tone and checked tone are represented as shown in the table above
 The representation of the high tone and creaky tone varies depending on the respective syllable rhyme: sometimes they are inherent in the vowel symbol used, and sometimes they are indicated by a diacritic mark
 The ALA-LC romanization indicates these two tones explicitly only in cases where diacritic marks are used; the other three romanizations indicate them regardless of how they are spelled
 Examples: Minor syllables in Burmese contain only the vowel template: ipachar in the rhyme and do not bear tone
 They are always followed by a major syllable
 In the orthography, they are most commonly spelled as if their rhyme was: ipachar, but are often spelled in other ways
 In the MLCTS and ALA-LC systems, minor syllables are romanized exactly as they are spelled in Burmese orthography
 In the modified BGN / PCGN system and in the Okell system, minor syllables are indicated by the letter ă regardless of the Burmese orthography
 Examples: Where two consonants appear next to each other between two vowels in a romanization, use hyphens as necessary to avoid ambiguity
 For example : In many words, a written voiceless consonant is pronounced voiced when it appears after a vowel or template: ipachar
 This is indicated in the BGN-PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 In BGN-PCGN, the letter for the voiced consonant is used; in Okell, the letter for the voiceless consonant is used but underlined
 Examples: hens chrishchiyan jnshim gram ek danish jeevanu vaigyanik the

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress

 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically
 jaise newton ke pehle bhi gurutvkarshan kaa bal kaary karata tha kintu newton ne uganukool shabdaawalee dekar ise vishwa ko "gurutvkarshan ke niyam" ke ghoshit siddhanton se avgat karaayaa, jo newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 
 Shreemadbhagvatgeeta ka bhashya sambhavatah sanskrit ke vyakaranacharya paanini krit astadhayi se prerit hai parantu vibhinah purva ke paandulipi ke samuchit adhyan dwara vishesh arth nikala ja sakta hai

 This article is about the production of electricity using solar energy
 saura urja ke anya upyogon ke liye saura urja dekhen
 Solar power solar thermal light solar solar vehicle solar cell saura urja surya se praapt shakti ko kehete hai
 This energy is converted into heat or electricity and brought to other uses
 us rup ko hi saura urja kehete hai
 Solar energy is used in homes, cars and airplanes
 urja kaa yah rup saaf or pradooshan rahit hota he
 Solar panels are needed to get energy from the Sun and use it
 solar panelon main solar cell hote hai jo surya kii urja ko prayog karne laayak banaate hai
 There are many types of this
 jaise pani garm karne vaale solar panel bijli pahunchane vaale solar panelon se bhinn hote hai
 Solar energy is converted for use in two ways
 kuch varsh purv tak saura urja kaa prayog puraane dhang se bani imaaraton main kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Experts have done research on solar energy due to lack of fossil fuels in some developed countries
 anek udyogon main saura urja ko apnaane ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Solar energy continues to be used in many heterogeneous areas where the penetration of other energy sources is less
 saura bydaree yaa saura cell photovoltike prabhaav ke dwaara surya yaa prakaash ke kisi anya strot se urja praapt karata he
 Solar batteries are coupled to most devices in such a way that they become part of the device itself and cannot be separated from it
 surya kii roshni se ek yaa do ghante main yah puri tarah charge ho jaati he
 The cell in the solar battery incorporates the light to cause the electrons of the semiconductors to react with that metal
 ek baar yah kriya hone ke baad electron main upasthit urja yaa to bydaree main bhandar ho jaati he yaa phir sidhe prayog main aati he
 The solar battery discharges at its fixed time after energy is stored
 ye upkaran main lage hue swachaalit tareeke se punah chaalu hoti he, yaa use koi vyakti on karata he
 You can also buy a solar cell at home, today i will tell you about making a simple solar cell, this is just a modal, so that you will be able to get some better knowledge about the energy
 aap is modal se LED balb bgerah chalaa sakate hai
 Things you need ::
 You need copper wire, copper sheet, a plastic bottle, salt, hot water
 yah lekh kaise ghar par ek saura cell banane ke liye aapako bataa degaa, or yah karne ke baad aap ek ghadi, radio jese apane chote upkarnon ko chalaa sakate hai
 Method :: - 1 Take a copper sheet and cut it into equal parts
 kaatane ke baad aapke paas ek hi aakaar ke 2 tukade banegein
 Heat a sheet of 2 copper, about 20-30 MIN
 Till then let it cool down without breaking it
 3 iske saath tambe kii ek tar jod do
 Clean that place Jha to add tar
 Take another sheet and attach it to the tar as well
 5 ek plastic bottle lo or use bich se cat do ab isaki tali me namak or pani kaa ghol bana lo
 6 Now pour the heated copper sheet into this solution, but take care that only the sheet does not touch the wire
 7 ulti disha main duusari shit bhi daal do
 Your solar cell is ready
 
 
 
 TIPS :: - 1 Use salt to make solution
 2 cell ko achhi dhup main rakhen jese pani garm hone lagegaa aapkaa cell kam karne lagegaa
 3 Change the water after 2-3 days
 saura urja kii kai pareshaaniyaan bhi hoti hai
 Large-scale power generation requires heavy investment on panels
 doosraa, duniya main anek sthanon par surya kii roshni kam aati he, isliye vahaan solar panel kargar nahin hai
 Third, solar panels do not produce much electricity during the rainy season
 phir bhi visheshgyon kaa mat he ki bhavishya main saura urja kaa adhikadhik prayog hoga
 The Prime Minister of India has recently expressed a desire to build a solar valley in India like Silicon Valley
 photovoltac cell, spain Nellis Solar Power Plant, North America germany main sthapit energy park Steel towing ispaat ke anek taron ke sanyog se tarasutra or anek tarsutron ko milakar ek cabel banataa he
 The wires in the wire and cable are sometimes inserted into a unit by placing and collecting them parallel to each other
 1 Thus the cables are made by twisting the wires and the cables are made by twisting the wires
 jab taron ko ek disha main anthkar tarasutra banaaya jaataa hai or tarsutron ko vipareet disha main anthkar cabel banaaya jaataa he tab ise niyamit le kehete hai
 When the string is placed in the same direction in which the wire is attached to it, it is called long le rope
 6 x 17 niyamit le rassa usko kehete hai jisamen chha: aise tarasutra hon jinke centre shadbhuj ke konon par hon or prayek tarasutra main 17 taare hon
 Routine carry ropes are less likely to be crushed and deformed as long lay ropes are more capable of preventing wear
 prayek taar or tarasutra ko gathit karne se purv use antim sarpil aakaar dene ke liye purvanirmit kar liya jaataa he taaki taron or tarsutron kii sidhaa hone kii swaabhaavik pravriti kaa nivaaran ho jaae
 In important cable functions like swing bridges, the cable hangs a predetermined load equal to half of its ultimate strength so that its structural stress is removed
 yah bhaar bahut adhik samay tak bana rahane diya jaataa he or tab hataa diya jaataa he
 Such a precursor has a special significance in the installation of bridges, hanging cables and vertical radio columns mounted on vertical radio columns
 yadhyapi taron kii aapekshik dridhtaa upyog ke anusaar parivartansheel hoti he, tathaapi saadhaarant: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki cabel main lage taron main carbon kii maatra lagbhag 
06 % se 
08 % hoti he, jisase uski charam dridhtaa lagbhag 100 ton prati varg inch yaa isse adhik hoti he or unka nunatam khinchaav 8 inch nirdisht maap kii lambaai par lagbhag 2 se 4 pratishat hota he
 The cables that are affected by the seasons are often protected by galvanizing zinc
 kalai karne ke liye taron ko halake amla main daalkar safai kii jaati he
 Then it is added to the molten pure zinc of a percentage purity in which the amount of iron does not exceed 0
03 percent, this leads to a zinc layer
 jo ispaat ke sanksharan ko rokatii he
 The sticking of a zinc seam relies on the direct chemical addition of zinc and steel

 google idia ko khareednaa chahta tha, lekin in donon ke bich sauda nahin ho sakaa
 This form of advertising led to the company's desire to not give up, in 2000 the company brought in Edwards as its solution
 edwards us praaroop par kaary kar rahaa tha, jo bill gros kii rachana ke kaaphi saamaan tha or isi kaaran donon pakshon ke bich kanoonee kaarywahi bhi hui thi
 This dispute was eventually resolved by agreement outside the court
