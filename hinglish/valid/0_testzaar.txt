 maine pehali baar jab yah naatak padhaa to laga yah naatak samvaad-pradhan nahin, apekshaakrit drishy-pradhan he
 i was looking for a play that produced visual effects like this
 duusari baat bahut dinon se mere man main yah thi ki filmon main doorvarti madhyavarti or sameepvarti chitron kii teen-chaar duriyon or unke sammishran ke shilp or chaaturya se jo vishesh prabhaav utpann kiya jaataa he, vah rangamanch par bhi kyon na ho ? yah naatak samvaad, nrity, sangeet, gati, paatr, drishy aadi anek khandon ke yoga se agrasar hota he
 The formula that connects them is also tremendous
 in sab tattvon ke saath hi yah naatak ‘purna’ lagata he, atev kaalpanik camera haath main lekar hi maine ise saakaar karne kaa praytn kiya
 Dividing the theater by light-planning produced many desired effects on the theater far and near
 gati or samoohan aadi ko maine kagaji taiyaari main hi nirdhaarit kar liya tha
 In my method, the sketches of the theme are already prepared on every page of the performance copy of the play
 is naatak ke saath-pansth paatro kii gatiyaan swat:sfoort na hon varan niojit rahen, iske liye main puri tarah taiyaar tha
 The pace-style of these characters was expected to be like puppets
 charitra kii drushti se maine jo ghasiram chunaa, vah kad main chota tha
 He must have been a dwarf among the 'ragged' people around
 nrity-gatiyaan saral or sahaj kintu layaaddh thim
 The use of classical dance seemed complex and sophisticated in this folk dance
 nrity-gatiyon main lokanaty kii angadh urja kaa hona aavashyak tha
 The mere death of Ghasiram's dance was presented in a spontaneous manner
 dhol or nagaade kii prabal taal ko chandaavarkarji1 ne aage jaakar vishesh dhang se badhaayaa, jisase drishy kii bheeshanta badi

 Bhaskar Chandavarkar ji took only leather instruments for the music and he also played along with the performance, not recording it in advance
 usamen apwaad maatr sundari vaadya hi tha
 Sundari was played differently in the nana-gauri garden scene and at the time of Nana's marriage
 chandaavarkarji organ nahin chaahate the kyonki usase prachlit sangeet naatakon kaa sa asar lok-sangeet main aa jaataa
 Naman, Lavani, Powada, Wadhyamurali, Bharuad etc
 were sung along with their natural nature
 gunagunaane kaa upyog marathi rangamanch par pehali baar chandaavarkarji ne kiya
 Different emotions were expressed by the humming of the moving screen of humans
 ghasiram kii hatya ke baad utsav hota he or phir manushyon kaa paradaa saamne aata he
 The story has ended, so the actor who plays Nana also joins this screen
 ghasiram mara padaa he, par us abhinayta ke uthne se rasbhang na ho, isliye use apvaadrup yathasthaan hi rahane diya jaataa he
 Only then does the narrator go ahead and pay homage to that 'artist' by singing Shri Gajraj Nartan, Dhrupad in the compassionate voice of Bhairavi
 ek prakaar se lokanataka kaa purna shilp yahan dikhta he or naanaa jaise sattadhari vyakti kaa pankti main aana bhi vishesh arth kaa dyotak ho jaataa he, kyonki jaise pehle bataaya gaya, angrej peeche khadaa yah sab dekh rahaa he
 But this form of drama, more than the folklore craft, makes one think deeper
 ghasiram darshakon se sidhe baat karata he, prabhaav ko gahan karne ke liye jo ki brekht ke vipareet he, kyonki yahan ghasiram katha-sutara main baadha nahin daalata, na hi vah prabhaav ko mitaane kaa ytn karata he
 It is here that Tendulkar has used a different craft than orthodox folk dance
 veshbhusha main aitihaasik pramanikta kaa aagrah nahin bartaa gaya isse bhi lok-style kaa prabhaav jamaa rahaa
 The colors must be chosen carefully so that there is a possibility of color mixing in the grouping etc
 abhyaas teen-saadhe teen maheenon tak har din kiya gaya
 The dance, song, dialogue all went hand in hand
 mandali kaa koi bhi kalakaar vyavsaayik nartak yaa gayak nahin tha
 All came from hobbies — were amateurs
 yahi nahin, saath main se pachchis to aise the jinhone manch par isse pehle kabhi paanv na rakhe the
 But his labor, dedication and confidence were strong
 lagansheel, kalakaar, nrity-nirdeshak, sangeet-nirdeshak or nirdeshak ke sahyogi prayaskarm se hi yah alag dhang kii prastuti ho saki

 From a legal point of view, child crime is an anti-legal act done by a child over 8 years of age and below 16 years of age, which is presented before the Children's Court for legal proceedings
 bharat main bal nyaay adhinium 1986 ke anusar 16 varsh tak kii aayu ke ladakon evam 18 varsh tak kii aayu kii ladakiyon ke aparaadh karne par bal apradhi kii shrenee main sammilit kiya gaya he
 The maximum age limit for juvenile delinquency varies from state to state
 is aadhaar par kisi bhi rajya dwaara nirdhaarit aayu seemaa ke antargat balak dwaara kiya gaya kanoonee virdohi kaary bal aparaadh he
 Not only does age determine child crime, but the seriousness of crime is also an important aspect in it
 7 se 16 varsh kaa ladkaa tathaa 7 se 18 varsh kii ladki dwaara koi bhi aisa aparaadh na kiya gaya ho jiske liye rajya mrityu dand athwa aaajeevan karawas detaa he jaise hatya, deshadroh, ghaatak akraman aadi to vah bal apradhi maani jaayegaa
 From sociological point of view, age is not given much importance for juvenile delinquency as the mental and social maturity of the person is not always affected by age, hence some scholars consider the behavior trend manifested by the child as the basis for child crime, such as loitering , Absent from school, disobeying parents and guardians, using obscene language, characterless person Keep in touch with issues and more
 kintu jab tak koi vaid tarika sarvasammiti se sweekaar nahin kar liya jaataa tab tak aayu ko hi bal aparaadh kaa nirdharak aadhaar mana jaayegaa
 According to Gillin and Gillin, from a sociological point of view, a child criminal is a person whose behavior is considered harmful by the society and therefore he is prohibited by it
 is prakaar bal aparaadh main baalko ke asaamaajik vyavhaaron ko liya jaataa he athwa baalkon ke aise vyavhaara kaa jo lok kalyaan kii drushti se ahitkar hote hai, aise kaaryon ko karne vaala bal apradhi kahala ta he

 Some felt neglected by parents and others either felt inferior or jealous of their siblings or were suffering from mental stress, they were involved in crime to solve these problems, because of this or So their parents would get their attention or support from their peers or reduce their guilt
 bandoora or walterm ne shwet bal aparaadhiyon ke krityon kii tulana anpradhi ladako se hi jinamein aarthik kathinaayeeyon ke spasht sanket nahin the, unhen pataa chalaa kii apradhi anpraadheeyon se unki maataaon ke saath sambandhon kii drushti se thodaa sa bhinn hi he, lekin unke pitaaon ke saath apane sambandhon main kuch adhik bhinn the, is prakaar aparaadh main pita putr sambandh, mata putr sambandh kii apeksha adhik mahatvapurn dikhaai die kyonki apane pita main adarsh bhoomika kii anupasthiti ke kaaran apradhi ladke naitik mulyon kaa antareekaran nahin kar sake, iske saath hi unka anushaasan adhik kathor tha
 In this type of crime, child crime happens with other children and it is not found in the person's personality or family, but in the person's family and neighborhood culture
 thressure shaw or maike ke adhyayan bhi isi prakaar ke bal aparaadh kii baat karte hai, mukhya rup se yah paaya gaya ki yuvak apradhi isliai bana kyonki vah pehle se hi apradhi vyaktiyon kii sangati main rahata tha, baad main sadarland ne is tathy ko spasht rup se prastut kiye

 David Matja has referred to a similar type of crime
 vibhinn vidwaanon ne vibhinn adharon par bal-aparaadhiyon kaa vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 For example, they are classified into 6 categories
 1
 ashaadhyita udaahranarth : der raat tak baahar rahanaa, 2
 run away from school, 3
 chori, 4 property damage, 5
 hinsa evam 6

 The family is the first school for children, where it is influenced by the behavior of its parents and siblings
 jab mata-pita bacchon ke prati apane dayitvo kaa nirvaah karne main asamarth rahete hai, to bacchon se bhi shreshth naagarik banane kii apeksha nahin kii ja sakati he
 Many reasons related to the family are responsible for criminalizing the child
 bacchon ke sharir or swasthya kaa sambadh uske vanshanukraman se bhi he jo ki uski shaareerik or saamaajik bhoomikaaon ko prabhavit karata he, italy ke aparaadhashaqui lombroso ne to apradhi pravriti ko vyakti kii shaareerik visheshtaon se janit hi mana tha
 Godai, Richard Dugdell and Ista Buch studied the Kalikak and Juke families and found that these families were physically damaged and all generations of these families were criminals
 bharat main bhootpurv apradhi janajatiyon ko bhi vanshanukraman ke aadhaar par apradhi ghoshit kiya gaya tha, apradhi ko vanshanukraman kii dein maanane vaale vidwaan mendal ke vanshanukraman ke siddhanth se prabhavit the
 But in present-day criminology, this concept was boycotted
 bart ore gilin ne apane adhyayanon me bal aparaadh ko vanshanukraman se sambadhit nahin paaya
 Fractal families can break up in the following two ways - physically and mentally
 bhautik rup se parivaar ke tuutane kaa arth he - parivaar ke sadsy kii mrityu ho janaa, lambe samay tak aspataal, jail, sena aadi main rahane ke kaaran athwa talaak or pruthakkaran ke kaaran sadasyon kaa parivaar main saath-saath nahin rahanaa he
 The meaning of the breakdown of the family mentally is - the members live together but they have bad feelings, mental conflicts and tension
 hansaa seth, car, bart, bezehot, sulenger va gluk aadi anek vidwaanon ne apane adhyayanon main paaya ki bhagn parivaar bal aparaadh ke janak he
 Children are imitators, they learn every good and bad thing from the elders on the basis of imitation, if the elder siblings in the family are criminals and treat them badly then the personality of the children gets distorted, the tone of rebellious spirit in them They become asserted, they start living out of the downtrodden environment and become criminals after receiving wrong messages, or parents do not give equal affection to children
 Te, in this case the children get separated from their families and are awakened a sense of guilt on his mind
 mata-pita dwaara bachche ke vikaas or antah karan par sidhaa prabhaav daalate hai
 Lack of discretion leads to aggression, combined with a sense of enmity, Andrey also admits that child criminals find less parental love than criminals

 a family unable to meet the needs of children can also cause insecurity in the child and affect the amount of control that the family can exert on the child as he or she receives material support and protection outside the family
 petersan or baker ne bataaya ki aparaadhiyon ke parivaar praayah bhautik rup se kamjor hote hai, jo ki bal apradhi ke swany ke pratyakshan ko prabhavit kar sakate hrain or usko ghar se bhaagane main sahaayak ho sakate he
 In modern society, as a result of urbanization, the person does not get enough place to live, even the big family has to live in a very small place
 iske kaaran mata-pita na to bacchon par purna dhyaan de pate hai, na hi koi aantarik suraksha unhen mil paati he, manoranjan ke saadhan bhi uplabdh nahin hote hai, atah bachche aparaadh kii ore pravruth ho jate hai, mata-pita swany hi unhen baahar bhejnaa pansad karte he, jahaan bachche apradhi baalkon kii sangati praapt karte hai or swayan bhi apradhi ban jate hai
 In addition to family reasons, there may be such shortcomings in the individual himself that he reveals the criminal behavior
 shaareerik kaarak : jab balak kisi prakaar kii shareerik aakshamata kaa shikaar hota he to usamen hinata kii bhaavana viksit ho jaataa he ve aparaadh kii ore pravruth ho jate he, siril, bart, heale tathaa bronor evam gluk aadi ne bal aparaadhiyon ke adhyayan me aisa paaya, hattan ne anek prakaar ke shaareerik dosha jais bahraapan, sthai rog, shareerik aapangata, buddhi kii kami ko bal aparaadh kaa kaaran mana he
 Psychologists have also considered mental inequalities responsible for child crime, two factors are important in mental causes
 godard, heale evam bronor aadi ne adhyayano dwaara yah paaya ki bal apradhi maansik rup se pichhade hote he, klesh evam chaso ne columbia vishvidhyalay main san 1935 main apana ek lekh ‘‘di relation bitwin morlity and intlect prakashit kiya jisamen darshaya ki kamjor mastishk vaale pariwaron kaa jhukaav aparaadh kii ore adhik tha, maansik pichhadepan ke kaaran unamem tark shakti kaa abhaav hota he
 Children also become criminals due to emotional instability, with studies by Cyril Burt, Heale, and Broner found that child criminals often feel insecure and prone to mental conflict, which is why they tend to turn to crime
 jis samudaay main baccha rahata he yadi uskaa vaataavaran anupyukt he to vah balak ko apradhi bana saktaa he, saamudayik karkon main se kuch pramukh kaa ham yahan ullekh karenge
 Neighborhood impact is more visible in urban areas, in addition to family, the child spends most of his time with neighborhood children, neighborhood crime can be helpful in disrupting personality requirements, culturally-struggling and nurturing antisocial values

 Residence in the criminal area is also closely related to the criminal trend, there are more opportunities for children to be criminals when prostitutes are located, gamblers, alcoholics have more residence because of the high prevalence of imitation and suggestion of children
 There is a possibility of learning, Shaw and Manne said that many places are not safe to keep children, the city center Crimes are more prevalent in the business sector, as the rate of crime decreases from the center of the city to the periphery, Heale and Broner believe that slum children are affected by prevailing patterns of crime
 
 upurkt karkon ke atiktik bal aparaadh ke liye kuch anya kaarak bhi uttaradaayi he jaise mulio ke bhram, saanskarik bhinnata evam sangharsh, naitik patan, swantatrata main vruddhi, aarthik mandi aadi
 It is clear that no single factor is involved in criminalizing the child, but only the co-presence of many factors contributes to criminalizing the child

 This theory focuses on group crime

 To the satisfaction of, he gets converted into a gang which his environment and his family does not provide to him
 dhire-dhire giroh visisth gunon kaa vikaas karata he, jaise kaary karne kii vidhi, apradhi takneekon ko prachaarit karata he, parsparik hiton or abhiruchio ko uksaata he or apane sadasyon ko suraksha pradaan karata he
 According to this theory, the criminal areas are helpful in high rate of child crime - the criminal areas are low income and materially undesirable areas, whose members are victims of economic neglect, it is the influence of the criminal traditions that exist in these areas
 is siddhanth ke anusaar kuch simit sankhya main hi vyakti apradhi pahchaan dhaaran karte hai jabaki adhik sankhya main log kanoon paalak hi rahete hai, apradhi banane tathaa apradhi pahchaan dhaaran karne main kanoon ullaghann karne waalon kii keval sangati karne se bhi kuch adhik sammilit hota he

 The deep history of Dadra and Nagar Haveli begins with the defeat of the Koli chieftains of the region by the invading Rajput kings
 maraathon ne rajputon ko haraa kar 18veen sadi ke madhya main apana shashan sthapit kiya
 After a long struggle between the Marathas and the Portuguese, on 17 December 1779, the Maratha Peshwa Madhava Rao II handed over revenue of Rs 12,000 to the Portuguese to 79 villages of the region to ensure friendship

 And the second part which started after the restoration of this party in 1957 when he added "all India" to his name and also changed his constitution
 Qasim Rajvi, who was the president of the Majlis at the time of the Indian government's crackdown against the state of Hyderabad, was arrested and handed over the reins of this party to Abdul Wahd Owaisi, the then famous lawyer, before leaving for Pakistan
 uske baad se yah party isi parivaar ke haath main rahi he
 abdul vahed ke baad salahuddin ovaisi uske adhyaksh bane or ab unke putr asaduddin ovaisi us ke adhyaksh or saansad hai jab unke chote bhai akbaruddin ovaisi vidhaan sabha main party ke netaa hai
 The leaders of this family and Majlis have been alleging that they have been promoting communal tension in Hyderabad with their provocative speeches
 But on the other hand, supporters of the Majlis see it as the answering power of the Bharatiya Janata Party and other Hindu organizations

 The Majlis accused the Congress government of adopting anti-muslim policies and withdrew its support from him
 The uproar over Akbaruddin Owaisi's so-called speech and the way he is arrested and sent to jail is being seen in the context of the confrontation between Congress and Majlis

 Recently, he created a stir by winning 11 seats in Nanded Municipality of Maharashtra
 The Congress in Andhra Pradesh is troubled by the possibility that AEMEM may join hands with Jaganmohan Reddy's YSR Congress in the 2014 elections
 After the arrest of Akbaruddin Owaisi, there was no possibility of any compromise between the Majlis and the Congress

 6 inhen bhi dekhen7 sandarbh8 or padhein9 bahari link Cornelia Sorabji was an Indian woman, the first female graduate from the University of Bombay, the first woman to study law at Oxford University, the first female lawyer in India, and the first woman to practice law in India and the UK
 2012 main, landan ke linkan in main unki pratimaa kaa anaavaran kiya gaya tha
 She was also a social reformer and writer
 15 navambar 1866 ko nasik main janmin carnelia 1892 main naagarik kanoon kii padhai ke liye videsh gayin or 1894 main bharat lautin
 us samay samaaj main mahilaayein mukhar nahin thim or na hi mahilaon ko vakaalat kaa adhikaar tha
 But Cornelia was a passion
 apni pratibha kii badaulat unhone mahilaon ko kanoonee paraamarsh dena aarambh kiya or mahilaon ke liye vakaalat kaa pesha kholane kii maang uthaai
 antat: 1907 ke baad carnelia ko bengal, bihar, urisa or assam kii adaalaton main sahaayak mahila vakil kaa pad diya gaya
 In 1924, after a long struggle, the law prohibiting women from advocating was relaxed and opened this profession for them
 1929 main carnelia hoicourt kii varisht vakil ke taur par sevanivrutt huyin par uske baad mahilaon main itani jagriti aa chuki thi ki ve vakaalat ko ek peshey ke taur par apanaakar apni aawaaj mukhar karne lagi thim
 Although Cornelia died in 1954 when she was in London, her name is still the foundation of women in a complex and prestigious profession like advocacy
 1894 main bharat lautne par, psorabji ne pardaanashin mahilaon kii ore se saamaajik or salaahkaar kaary main shaamil ho gayin, jinhen baahar purush duniya ke saath samvaad karne se manaa kiya gaya tha kai maamalon main, in mahilaon kii kaaphi sampatti hoti thi, lekin unki raksha ke liye aavashyak kanoonee visheshgyata tak pahunch nahin thi
 Sorabji was given special permission from the British agents of the rulers of Kathiawar and Indore to plead on behalf of Pardanshin, but was unable to protect her in court as a woman, not receiving a professional position in the Indian legal system Was
 is sthiti kaa samaadhaan karne kii ummid main, psorabji ne 1897 main bombai uniwarsity kii elelbi pariksha ke liye khud ko prastut kiya or 1899 main elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke vakil kii pariksha main bhaag liya
 Nevertheless, despite his successes, Sorbji was not recognized as a lawyer until the law prohibiting women from practicing in 1923 was changed
 prantiy nyaayalayon main mahilaon or naaballigon kaa pratinidhitiv karne ek mahila kanoonee salaahkaar pradaan karne ke liye psorabji ne 1902 ke shuru main bharat karyaalay main yachika daayar karne kii shuruyaat kii thi
 In 1904, Lady Assistant was appointed to the Court of Wards of Bengal and due to the need for such representation in 1907, Sorabji was working in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam
 agle 20 saal kii seva main, anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki psorabji ne 600 se adhik mahilaon or anathon ko kanoonee ladaai ladane main madad kii, kabhi-kabhi koi shulk nahin liya
 She would later write many of these cases in her work Between the Twilights and two autobiographies
 1924 main, bharat main mahilaon ke liye kanoonee pesha kholaa gaya tha, or sorbaji ne kolkata main abhyaas karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 However, due to male bias and discrimination, she was limited to formulating opinions on cases rather than presenting them before the court
 sorbaji 1929 main ucch nyaayalay se sevanivrutt huin, or landan main bas gayin, sardiyon ke dauraan bharat kii yatra par aatin
 He died on 6 July 1954 at his London home at Northumberland House on Green Lane in Manor House, London

 Chinakallepalli has a village in Krishna district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 jalayaan yaa pani kaa jahaaj, pani par tairte hue gati karne main sakasham ek bahut bada dibba hota he
 a ship is different from a boat in that it is much larger than a boat
 jalayaan jhiilon, samudron evam nadiyon main chalate hai
 They are used in many ways; Such as - to bring people, to carry goods, to catch fish, for recreation, to maintain and protect the beaches and for war
 jahaaj samudr ke avaagaman tathaa dur deshon kii yatra ke liye jin brihad naukaaon kaa upyog prachinkaal se hota aayaa he unhen jahaaj kehete he
 Earlier ships were relatively small and made of wood
 pravidhik tathaa vaigyanik unnati ke aadhunik kaal main bahut bade, mukhyat: lohe se bane tathaa injanon se chalanevaale jahaaj banate hai
 The ship from which whatever work is taken
 usee ke anusaar uski abhiklpana or nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, according to work, the ships are divided into three classes: inke bhi kai upvarg hote hai, jinka neeche krmanusaar aage varnan kiya gaya he- In this class, vessels for sinking ships, laying and repairing sea wire, small onboard, small ships, food vessels, fishing boats and ferries, etc
 are the main ones
 prayek jahaaj ke dhaanche kii abhiklpana is prakaar se kii jaati he ki uske injanon, pranoditron athwa pedal wheelon, sahaayak yantron tathaa panchon aadi ke chalane ke kaaran or visheshkar samudri laharon ke kaaran jo vikrutiyaan tathaa pratibal paden, unhen vah sah le
 When the ships are moving, when the front air has to compete
 us samay yadi jahaaj kii chaudaai ke baraabar lambii lehren uthne lagati hai, to kai ber koi ek hi badi lahar bich main jahaaj ko adhar main uthaa le sakati he
 Then the front and back ends of the ship will hang with the same type as if a laden beam is lifted from the middle
 jahaaj kaa is dasha ko uttalan kehete hai
 Sometimes it happens that the front and back end of the ship gets stuck on the waves and the middle space becomes empty, just as a laden beam rests on both the ends
 is paristhiti main jahaaj ke dhaanche par padanevaale pratibalon ko avatalan kehete he
 Sometimes there is a mixture of these two situations, in which the stress is called shearing
 jab hawa tirchhi chalati he tab kabhi kabhi jahaaj ke dhaanche main marod pratibal padate hai
 Lateral deformations occur when sideways air moves
 iske atirikt pani main duube rahanevaale bhaag par samudri pani kaa bhi atyadhik daab padakar dhaanche ko chipkaane kii pravriti dikhaata he
 Most and severe types of deformations occur at the front and rear ends when the vessel is produced due to the uneven loading of goods and the impact of waves and buoyant force of water
 laharon dwaara padanevaali vikrutiyon kii gananaa karte samay maan liya jaataa he ki prayek lahar kii lambaai jahaaj kii chaudaai ke baraabar or unki oonchaai lambaai ke wein bhaag ke urabar he
 While designing the structure of a ship, each of its components is designed such that whatever stress is placed on it, is divided into all and spread across the structure in such a way that the components on each component bear the shock
 jahaaj kaa pathan sabase neeche rahanevaala buniyadi avyav he, jiske sahare samast dhaanchaa khadaa kiya jaataa he
 It is made by iron or cast steel in three ways - single thick rods, flat strips or plates
 mariya ek se adhik tathaa vibhinn aakaar ke banaae jate hai
 The major of these is standing on the center line of the ship's bottom
 sab milakar samast pende ko sahaara dete hai
 The front end of the Pathan by Mallajod
 upar ko uthaa hua jo avyav dhale hue ispaat kaa banaakar joda jaataa he vah dumbal kehalaata he
 In this, the middle maria and the outer shell are made by sitting on a plate and roots are made
 peeche kii taraf dhale ispaat kaa jo khadaa avyav isi prakaar joda jaataa he vah dumbal stambh yaa kudas kehalaata he
 In order to support the rudder and if there are ships with one or three propellants, the intermediate propellant is made to rotate in the same place
 jahaaj ke samast dhaanche kii rachana panjaranuma hoti he
 All parts of the pan are made by angle, iron and bandages
 ye panjar dohare hote hai, ek bhitari or doosraa bahari
 The places where the lower floor of the ship rests are placed between the outer and inner sides, also known as maria or floors
 inke kaaran penda bahut hi drudh ho jaataa he
 To provide stability to the sides of the two sides of the ship, vertical strips and horizontal strings are placed between them
 lamb pattiyaan jahaaj ke panjar se angal platon ke saath reveton dwaara jad di jaati hai
 The entire ship's scaffold is made in several sections and a dhramana is attached to the upper end of each side, which supports the plate of the upper deck
 jin jahaajon main ek se adhik deck hote hai, unamem prayek deck ko sanbhaalane ke liye prayek khand main ek ek sthuna lagaai jaati he
 The upper deck is always made of steel plates and wooden planks are placed on it
 neeche ke deck lakdi ke takhton se hi banaae jate hai
 In some ships the bottom decks are also made of steel plates
 yah sab upyog par nirbhar karata he
 a pillar is also made of steel to support them, in the midst of the clutches of the ship's sides
 jin jahaajon kii chaudaai adhik hoti he unke madhya khambhe ke donon ore ek khambha or laga diya jaataa he
 Cargo warehouses require more open space
 at: unamem khambhe na lagaakar anya prakaar kii yuktiyon se kaam liya jaataa he
 Nital plaques ye jahaaj ke bahari aavaran se baahar kii ore nikali rahati hai tathaa jahaaj kii lunthangati ko avarodhit karne ke uddeshy se lagaayi jaatin hai
 Due to these, there is a lot of obstruction in the deceleration of the ship's shell, due to which the plunger does not stop at all, but it is reduced considerably
 jahaaj ke pende par puri lambaai bhar main, ispaat ke platon ko brakaton dwaara jadkar, unase bheetein banaakar jalaabhedya kamare bana die jate hai, jinaki oonchaai dotale pende se lekar samudri pani kii sataha tak hoti he
 These rooms are very useful, because when accidentally a hole is made in the ship's casing, the sea water is filled only in the adjacent room and the rest of the ship is safe
 kai baar jahaaj kii lambaai kii disha main laden hue maal kaa santulan thik karne ke liye kisi upyukt kamare main jaan boojhkar bhi pani bhar diya jaataa he
 In many old types of ships, these rooms were made in such a way that to get from one to the other, they had to climb into the hole made in their roof and get into the hole of the other
 aadhunik jahaajon main unki deevaaron main hi daravaaje laga die jate hai
 These holes and doors are made absolutely elastic by applying rubber straps and clamps
 vyapaaree jahaajon main adhik se adhik teen deck hote hai
 The height of a decked ship is approximately 24 feet from the height of the deck and 15 feet, the height of the two-deck ship is 24 feet from the plateau to the upper deck and 35 feet for the tan deck
 lekin bade samudri poton or maal jahaajon kii samgr oonchaai isse adhik ho jaati he
 Outer cover of ships - It is made of sheets of steel and its thickness is determined by the ratio of the volume of the ship, the cargo to be filled in it and the water pressure of the part in which it is fastened
 jahaaj ke pende or adwal se neeche ke plate, jinhen peraj bhi kehete hai sabase mote rakhe jate hai
 The adjacent plates of Mandan and Kudas are also quite thick
 inaki adhik se adhik motaai ek inch hoti he
 It is customary to measure the thickness of the cover plates to the 20th of an inch
 jahaaj ke madhya bhaag main neeche kii taraf sabase adhik chaudaai rahati he, jise "dharan naap" kehete hai
 The width of the top side of it decreases gradually, which is called the inner inclination of the middle part of the ship
 ise upar ke deck se ek hi taraf ko napa jaataa he
 Near the front and rear ends, downwards, the width of the ship decreases gradually, making the shape of the passage there to be V-shaped
 is neeche se upar badhati chaudaai ko jahaaj kaa apsaran kehete hai
 In this, their main structure, double sides and long strips etc
 are finished till the middle deck
 vihaar deck tathaa nauka deck kii adhirachana upree dhaanche ke rup main uparale or khule deck par kar di jaati he
 Large passenger ships, while being heavier than cargo ships, floated higher than the sea surface
 at: unhen adhik drudh tathaa saavdhaanee se bananaa padataa he, jisase koi durghatana ho jane par bhi samudri pani unamem pravesh na kar sake
 The registers of torpedo boats and warships have the same design as those of passenger ships, but are made so firm that they move when moving engines, firing cannons, or moving the ship repeatedly
 To withstand the effect of vibrations occurring
 inaki pathan chapate platon se banaakar uske aage peeche ke siron ko mandaan or kudaal kii jhiriyon main daalkar mode diya jaataa he
 Then they are also confirmed by mall joints
 bahari or bhitari pathan platon ko panjar ke saath takkari jod dwaara kasakar, neeche kii taraf bahari aavaran platon kii koron ko pathan ke saath hi jad dete hai
 In the arms godowns, a thick steel armor plate is fitted for protection to the height of the engine and equipment
 sabase aage kii potbhit tathaa dumbal ke bich kuch khaali jagah chhod di jaati he, jise takkar pitabhit kehete hai

 diod ek p tip semiconductor or n tip semiconductor kaa jankshan hota he isliye diod ko ham P-N jankshan diod bhi kehete hai
 As we know that the p type semiconductor has more holes and the electrons in the n type semiconductor
 hamen ye bhi pataa he ki vipareet charged partical ek dusre ko apni ore aakarshith karte hai or saamaan vikarshith
 chunki electrons negative charged partical hote he or hole posetive, isliye jab ham donon prakaar ke semiconductor ko milaate hai to electrons or hole ek dusre ko aakarshith karte he
 After some time, the attraction of both becomes limited and a layer of electrons and holes is formed near the junction and we call it the depletion region
 diod ek bipolar divaais hota he matlab isamen negative or posetive done said hote he
 Here you can see the design of diode and its electronic symbol
 isamen anode rinatmak or cathod dhanatmak siron ko darshata he
 For the current to flow in the diode, we have to connect it to some voltage source such as a battery
 As we know that the battery also has both negative and positive ends so we can connect the diode with the battery in two ways and these methods we call biasing
 jab ham bydaree ke ko diod ke se or bydaree ke ko diod ke se jodate hai to ise forward bisingh kehete hai or jab ham bydaree ke ko diod ke se or bydaree ke ko diod ke se jodate hai to ise reverse bisingh kehete hai
 Now you notice that when we add the diode to the forward bias, the end of the battery rotates the holes and in the same way the end of the battery rotates the electrons
 is prakaar diod se karant kaa pravaah chaalu ho jaataa he

 Pushpakaviman was the air vehicle described in the Hindu mythological epic Ramayana

 In the ancient Hindu texts of India, about ten thousand years ago, detailed description has been given in planes and wars and their use

 Apart from this, such references are given to planes with other military capabilities, their use, collision of planes, invisible and chasing

 The aircraft had many features, such that its size could be reduced or enlarged as needed

 Once Ravana had forcefully taken away his city of Lankapuri and this plane from Kubera, then Kuber built a new city of Alakapuri near present-day Tibet
 ravan ke vadh uparant bhagwaan ram ne ise lekar ekal prayog uparant iske mul swami kuber ko lautaa diya tha
