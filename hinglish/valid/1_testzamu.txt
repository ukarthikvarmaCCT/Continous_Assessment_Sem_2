 In Napoleon Bonaparte had a businessman soldier
 aap bachapan se hi dayaalu prakruti ke the
 During your childhood you saw eight people from the village dying of the mad wolf bite
 unki dardebhari chikhon ko aap bhul nahin sake the
 Even in puberty, when this past incident took place on the table, you used to get restless
 par aap padhane-likhane main vishesh tej nahin the
 Still, there were two qualities in you, which are necessary for success in science - curiosity and endurance
 yuvavastha main aapane likhaa tha ki shabdkosh main teen shabd atyant mahatvapurn hai: ichhashakti, kaam tathaa safalataa
 After finishing college, started working in a chemist to achieve his goal
 yahan par aapane crystalon kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa kuch mahatvapurn anusandhan bhi kiye
 You got good fame in the form of chemicals from them
 san 1849 i
 In France, the Minister of Education appointed you to teach physics in the school of Dijon

 The secret of this advancement was that the university president had a girl whose name was mine
 meri shyaamal keshon vaali sundar kishori thi
 You met him meri kaa achoota lavanya aapke hryday main ghar kar gaya
 Only a week after the meeting, you proposed marriage to Mary
 meri ne aapke prastaav ko thukraa diya
 But Louis Pasteur was a good scientist
 dhirajata aap main thi
 You continued to try despite Mary's refusal
 ek varsh ke baad aapako apni ichha purti main safalataa mili
 Mary accepted to be your wife
 vivaah ke uparant aapaki ruchi rasayan vigyaan se hat kar jeevigyaan kii ore agrasar hone lag gai

 One day a group of wine makers came to meet Louis Pasteur
 unhone aap se poocha ki har varsh hamaari sharaab khatti ho jaati he
 What is the reason for this? lui pasture ne apane sookshmdarshi yantra dwaara madiraa kii pariksha karne main ghanton bitaa die
 In the end you found that very young creatures called bacteria sour the wine
 ab aapane pataa lagaaya ki yadi madiraa ko 20-30 minute tak 60 centegrade par garam kiya jaataa he to ye jeevanu nasht ho jate hai
 The heat is lower than the boiling temperature
 isse madiraa ke swaad par koi prabhaav nahin padataa he
 Later you used the same principle to keep the milk sweet and pure
 yahi doodh 'pascharit doodh' kehalaata he
 One day Louis Pasteur realized that if these tiny bacteria are in foods and liquids, they can also be in the blood of living animals and people
 ve beemaari paidaa kar sakate hai
 At the same time, there was a terrible epidemic in chickens of France called 'chuja's Cholera'
 lakhon chuje mar rahe the
 The henkeepers prayed for you to help us
 aapane us jeevanu kii khoj shuru kar di jo chuujon main haija failaa rahaa tha
 You see those bacteria floating around in the blood of dead chicks
 aapane is jeevanu ko durbal banaaya or injection ke madhyam se swasth chuujon kii deh main pahunchaaya
 This did not cause the chickens with vaccine cholera
 aapane tikaa lagane kii vidhi kaa avishkaar nahin kiya par chuujon ke haije ke jeevanuon kaa pataa laga liya
 After this Louis Pasteur made a vaccine for cows and sheep for the disease called anthrax: but you could not do them well after getting the disease: but you succeeded in preventing the disease from happening
 aapane bhedon ke durbal kiye hue enthraiks jeevanuon kii sui lagaai
 It used to be that the sheep had very mild anthrax; But he was so mild that he never fell ill and after that he would never get that fatal disease
 aap or aapke sahyogiyon ne maason france main ghumkar sahasron bhedon ko yah sui lagaai
 This protected the French cow and sheep industry
 aapane tarah-tarah ke sahasron prayog kar daale
 Many of them were also dangerous
 aap vifaille virus vaale bhayanak kutton par kaam kar rahe the
 So, you solved this problem
 aapane thode se vifaille virus ko durbal banaaya
 Then he prepared the vaccine for this virus
 is tike ko aapane ek swasth kute kii deh main pahunchaaya
 After applying the fourteen vaccines, he was protected against rabies
 aapaki yah khoj badi mahatvapurn thi; par aapane abhi maanav par iskaa prayog nahin kiya tha
 In 1885 AD
 kii baat he
 Louis Pasteur was sitting in his laboratory
 ek francisi mahila apane nau varshiya putr jojeff ko lekar unke paas pahaunchi
 The child was bitten by a rabid dog two days ago
 pagal kute kii laar main nanhe jeevanu hote hai jo rabies virus kehalaate hai
 If nothing is done, nine-year-old Jozef will slowly die from suffering from hydrotherapy
 aapane balak jojeff kii pariksha kii
 Perhaps some way to save him can be done
 bahut varshon se aap is baat kaa pataa lagane kaa prayaas kar rahe the ki jalasantras ko kaise roka jaae? aap is rog se vishesh rup se ghrinaa karte the
 Now the question was whether the boy should dare to apply needle on Josephine's rabies vaccine
 balak kii mrityu kii sambhaavna thi
 But his death is certain even after the needles are planted
 is duvidha main aapane tatkaal nirnay liya or balak jojeff kaa upachaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 For ten days, you kept applying the increasing amount of vaccine of the child Joseph and then a great surprise occurred
 balak jojeff ko jalasantras nahi hua
 On the contrary, he started getting better
 itihaas main pratham baar maanav ko jalasantras se bachaane ke liye sui lagaai gai
 You really gave this unique gift to mankind
 aapke deshavaasiyon ne aapako sab sammaan evam sab padak pradaan kiye
 He built the Pasteur Institute in honor of you: but Kirti and Aishwarya did not change you
 aap jeevanaparyant tak sadaiv rogon ko roak kar pidaa haran ke upayon kii khoj main lage rahe
 In 1895 AD main aapaki nixravastha main hi mrityu ho gai

 prasiddh sangeetkaar baiju baavaraa kii kabr, kataa pahaad or rajput striyon ke dwaara kiya gaya samuhik aatmadah yahan ke mukhya aakarshan hai
 This fort was almost destroyed by Babur's invasion
 kaha jaataa he yah kila babar ke liye kaaphi mahatv kaa tha isliye usne chanderi ke tatkaaleen rajput raja se yah kila maanga
 badale main usne apane jite hue kai kilon main se koi bhi kila raja ko dene kii peshkash bhi kii
 parantu raja chanderi kaa kila dene ke liye raji naa hua
 Babur then warned to win the fort battle
 The fort of Chanderi was surrounded by the surrounding hills, so the king was confident
 baber kii sena main hathi topein or baari hathiyaar the jinhen le kar un pahadiyon ke paar janaa dushkar tha or pahadiyon se neeche utarate hi chanderi ke raja kii fouj kaa saamana ho jaataa
 kaha jaataa he kii babar nishchay par drudh tha or usne ek hi raat main apni sena se pahari ko kaat daalane kaa avishwasaneey kaary kar daalaa
 uski sena ne ek hi raat main ek pahari ko upar se neeche tak kaat kar ek aisi daraar bana daali jisase ho kar uski puri sena or sajo-saamaan thik kile ke saamne pahunch gayi
 In the morning the king was shocked to see the whole army in front of his fort
 parantu rajput raja ne bina ghabaraae apane kuch sau sipaahiyon ke saath baber kii vishaal sena kaa saamana karne kaa nirnay liya or apni raajputniyon ko antim vidaa kar aatmghaatee yuddh ke liye prasthaan kiya
 The entire Rajput army naturally ended in the war
 tab kile main surakshit rajputniyon ne swayan ko akramanakari sena se apamaanit hone kii bajaaye swayan ko khatm karne kaa nirnay liya, ek vishaal chita kaa nirmaan kiya or sabhi striyon ne suhaganon kaa shringaar dhaaran kar ke swayan ko us chita ke hawaale kar diya
 jab baber uski sena kile ke andar pahaunchi to uske haath kuch naa aayaa
 This unbelievable act of Rajput valor and Jauhar of Rajputs was so blown away that he got the entire fort destroyed and never used it for himself
 aaj bhi vah rasta toote kile kii burjon se dikhataa he jise gauri ne ek hi raat main pahari ko katwa kar banaaya tha tathaa use "kataa pahaad" yaa "kati ghati" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 a later king installed a stone door at that place
 Above the door can still be seen the marks of the chisels run by Babur's army

 oon ke badale resham kaa bhi prayog kabhi-kabhi hota he parantu aise kaaleen bahut manhage padate hai or tikaoo bhi kam hote hai
 Carpets are also made of cotton yarn, but they do not have that much respect
 kaaleen kii peeth ke liye soot or patson kaa upyog hota he
 This fiber is particularly useful for the carpets of carpets because of the invaluable properties of elasticity in the wool filaments

 For this, by hanging wool sticks in bamboo poles, the wool is put into a hot colored solution and when the color is removed they are removed
 aadhunik rangaai mashin dwaara hoti he
 In some machines the dyeing is usually similar to the hand dyeing, but the colored solution is heated by water vapor and the sticks move around the machine

 ek turaki or ek farsi jo chitra 3 se spasht ho jaayengi
 The two strands of weft are weaved after a row of wool snares is applied
 tab phir oon ke fande baandhe jate hai or bane ke taar daale jate hai
 Each time the weft is weighed down with an iron claw, they are seated, which causes the weaving of the carpet

 bunaavat aisi hoti hai ki yadi oon paryaapt pusht ho to ek sira khinchne par ek pankti kaa sara oon ek samooche tukade main khinch jayega
 Then wool of many colors is used when there is a plotting of many colors and where there is a lack of color in the drafting, the threads of those colors are buried in the texture of the carpet

 The velvet page is beautiful to look at and very soft to touch
 taar khinchne kaa kaam swayan mashin baraabar karti rahati he
 Wool velvet page flakes in the Wilton carpet are weaved together more strongly than the double threads of the Brussels carpet
 ye kaaleen bahudhaa brusselles kii apeksha ghaney bune jate hai or inamen taul badhaane kaa praytn nahin kiya jaataa
 These carpets are preferred even when the price is high due to softness and workmanship

 The texture looks particularly dense and there is a possibility of incorporation of innumerable textures and colors in the making of such carpets
 anya kalinon ke samaan inamen bhi kai mail hote hai, parantu bunaavat main vishesh bhed nahin hota
 The only difference lies in the goodness, density and the trapping method of bunch fibers
 exminster kalinon kii banaavat chitra 8 main pradarshit kii gai he

 dwitiya vidhi main tapt karne kii kuch kriya ke ananthar chipkaanewaala padaarth pakkaa ho jaataa he or guchchhe dridhtaa se peeth par chipak jate hai
 Two carpets can also be prepared at the same time by sticking one back on each side of the wool flanks and cutting the loops in between

 Thick woven yarn is generally necessary for densely woven carpets
 keemtee oon ke adhik maatra main lagane ke saath ucch shrenee kaa taana bana aavashyak hota he

 Bruce Lee's stage name 李小龙 was first suggested by Yuan Boo Yun, when Lee played the title role in the 1950 Cantonese film 细 路 祥
 By then, Lee had already become a 4-year veteran child artist, with two feature films in Hong Kong to his name
 Prior to his return to the US in 1959, Bruce Lee had a solid 18-year career as a respectable child artist with an average of two films per year, during which he starred alongside some of the best Cantonese actors and actresses and in some films Played the central role
 Yuan was the creator of the popular comic segment "kid Cheung" on which the film was based, and the character whose son he played in the film was Bruce Lee's father Lee Hoi Chuen in real life
 aisa lagata he ki yah naam "lee little dragon " unke bachapan ke naam "small dragon " par aadhaarit tha, jaisaa ki chini parampara main dragon or phinics kramshah nar or maadaa ling kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye jode main aate hai
 The more likely analysis is that he came to be called "little Dragon" because, according to the Chinese zodiac, he was born in the year of the dragon
 unki patni linda sahit kai logon ne "dragon" sambandh ko thodaa-utsaahpurvak badhaate hue yah kaha ki lee kaa janm "dragon ke ghante" ke dauraan hua tha haalanki, pashu raashi-chakra saamaanya rup se din ke ghante par lagu nahin hota he, par jab yah hota he, to 6 se 8 AM vastav main "khargosh ke ghante" or "dragon ke ghante" ke bich chalata he
 Also, the name Little Dragon came long after he was born

 According to these sources, the show was produced by two authors and producers, Ed Spielman and Howard Freedlender, and the reason Lee was not offered the role was partly due to his ethnicity, but mostly because of his thick accent
 The reason was

 They both, i think, they want to keep me in the modern form and they think that the" Western "type of thing is out

 Bruce Lee's greatest influence on martial development stemmed from his study of Chinese martial arts Wing Chun
 Bruce Lee began training at Wing Chun at the age of 13 during the summer of 1954 under the famous Wing Chun Grandmaster Yip Mann
 wing chun prashikshan ke ek varsh baad, yip maan ke kuch anya chaatro ne lee ke saath, unke vansh ke kaaran prashikshan lene se manaa kar diya, chunki chini, marshall art takneekon ke shikshan ke sambandh main gopneeyata rakhte the, khaas kar videshiyon se
 iske baad ve sirf yip maan ke saath nijee taur par skool ke baahar apane wing chun mitron wiliam chyung or vong shun ljung ke saath prashikshan lene lage
 After his arrival in the United States in 1959, Lee began teaching martial arts

 This was basically his own attitude towards Wing Chun

 He recognized that traditional martial arts techniques were somewhat more rigid and formal and not practical in chaotic market fighting scenarios
 "vyaavhaarikta, lacheelaapan, gati or kaarykushalta " par jor dete hue lee ne ek pranali viksit karne kaa nirnay liya
 He started using different methods of training, such as weight training for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility and many others which he constantly adapted
 lee ne us par bal diya jise ve "bina style kii style " kehete the
 This included getting rid of the formalist approach, which, according to Lee's claim, was indicative of the traditional style
 chunki lee ne anubhav kiya ki pranali, jise ve ab june fain gung phu kehete hai, vah bahut pratibandhaatmak thi, ise ek darshan ke rup main viksit kiya or marshall art ko unhone jeet kun do yaa ve of da intercepting fist kaha

 iske alaava, brus lee ne dan inosanto ko ek hi din main sabhi teen diploma de die
 Most of the other Jeet Kune Do instructors have been directly certified by Dan Inosanto since Lee's death, with some remaining certificates signed by Bruce Lee
 james yim lee, lee ke ek qareebi dost, atirikt chaatro ko pramanit kiye bina mar gaye
 The only exception to this was Gary Dill who studied Jeet Kune Doe under James and obtained permission from the JKD to impart the teachings to others through a personal letter in 1972
 taaki kimura ne, aaj kii taarikh tak, june fain gung phu main keval ek hi vyakti ko pramanit kiya he: apane bete or vaaris endi kimura ko
 Dan Inosanto continued to train and certify students at Jeet Kune Do for nearly 30 years, making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to relate his training lineage to Bruce Lee

 yah naam do shabdon ke yoga se bana he 'june fan' or 'jeet kun do' 
 At the invitation of Ed Parker, Lee appeared at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed iterations of two-finger penalties approximately shoulder width away
 At the same Long Beach event he performed an "one inch punch" which is described as follows: Lee stood upright in front of a standing, stable companion, with knees bent, his right foot forward
 lee kaa daanyaa haath aanshik rup se aage tha or unki daanyi mutthi saathi ke seene se lagbhag ek inch dur thi
 Leaving his right hand behind, while maintaining his posture, Lee then hit the punch partner hard, causing the partner to fall back to the chair to prevent an injury, though his partner's inertia soon dropped him to the ground
 
 unka swayamsevak, california ke stowton kaa bob baker tha
 "I told Bruce not to do this kind of performance again", he recalls
 "jab unhone pichhali baar mujhe mukka maaraa tha, meri chaati main dard itnaa asahneeya tha ki mujhe kaam chhodkar ghar par rahanaa padaa
" Lee also appeared at the 1967 Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed various performances, including the famous "no-holds-barred" box against USKA World Karate Champion Vic Moore
 lee ne moore se kaha ki vah ek sidhaa panch uske chehre par maarenge or use bas us mukke ko rokane kaa prayaas karnaa he
 Lee retreated several steps and asked Moore if he was ready, when Moore nodded in support, Lee glanced towards him until he came within range of the blow
 iske baad unhone moore ke chehre par ek sidhaa mukka tatkshan maaraa or prabhaav se pehle band kar diya
 In eight attempts, Moore failed to stop any punches

 As a result, Lee's popularity and martial arts skills often put him in confrontation with many market thugs, stunt men and extras of martial arts who wanted to make a name for themselves
 bob wal, USPK karate champion or enter da dragon main ek sah-kalakaar, ek muthbhed ko yaad karte hai jo ek film extra ke lee ko lagaataar taana maarane se bhadak uthi thi
 He extorted that Lee was "a film star, not a martial artist," that he "wasn't that much of a fighter
" " lee ne uske taanon kaa jawaab dete hue use jis diwaar par vah baitha tha, usase neeche kud jane ke liye kaha
wal ne lee ke virdohi ko "honkong ke ek girohabaaz aadmi kii tarah," ek "atyant achche marshall kalakaar," ke rup main paribhaashit kiya or kaha ki vah tej, majboot or bruce se bada tha
 "this kid was good
 He was strong and fast, and he was really trying to punch Bruce's brains in
 But Bruce just methodically took him apart
" "bruce kept moving so well, this kid couldn't touch him


then all of a sudden, Bruce got him and rammed his ass with the wall and swept him up, proceeding to drop him and plant his knee into his opponent's chest, locked his arm out straight, and nailed him in the face repeatedly
" -- Bob Wall Dan Inosanto said, "there is no doubt in my mind that if Bruce Lee had gone into pro boxing he could have easily made it to the top three in either the underweight category or the junior-welter weight category
 lee ko lagata tha ki unke samay ke kai marshall kalakaar shaareerik anukulata par paryaapt samay kharch nahin karte hai
 Bruce incorporated all the ingredients for overall fitness - muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular tolerance and flexibility
 He tried traditional bodybuilding techniques to build heavier muscles or zodiacs
 However, Lee was careful to explain that mental and spiritual preparation Physical training in martial arts was fundamental to success
 apni pustak, da tao of jeet kun do main unhone likhaa
 Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics
 Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation
 "" JKD, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique
 keval 24 varsh kii umr main 1965 main honkong main thaharne ke dauraan lee ne jis bhaar prashikshan kaarykram kaa prayog kiya, usne unki bahon par baari jor diya

 The repetitions he used to do were 6 to 12
 Although this method of training was aimed at his fast and slow jerking muscles, this later resulted in weight gain or muscle mass, keeping Bruce slightly above 160 lbs
 Lee has documented having more than 2500 books in his personal library and concludes that "a strong muscle is a big muscle", a conclusion he later refutes
 bruce ne apni shaareerik kshamta ko adhiktam karne or maanav sharir ko isaki simaaon tak pahunchane ke liye sadaa apane prashikshan nityakarm ke saath prayog kiya
 They adopted many different routines and training, including rope jumping, which effectively met their training and bodybuilding objectives

 a typical exercise for Lee is to run two to six miles in 15 to 45 minutes, in which he used to change the pace at intervals of 3-5 minutes
 lee ek sthir bike par 45 minutes main 10 mil ke samakaksh tak chalaate the
 Lee occasionally did rope jumping exercises and jumped up to 800 after cycling
 lee apni muththi kii twachaa ko majboot karne ke liye bhi vyaayaam karte the, jisamen khurdure pattharon or bajri se bhari baaltee main hatho ko dhakelnaa bhi shaamil tha

 He later concluded that in order to achieve a high-capacity body, one cannot nourish it with a diet like junk food, and that the "wrong fuel" would make the body sluggish or loose
 lee ne senki hui chizon se bhi parhez kiya, yah kehete hue ki isse calories praapt hui jisane unke sharir ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Lee's diet included a protein drink; He always tried to take one or two daily, but in the latter part of his life he stopped drinking it
 linda yaad karti hai ki bruce kii qamar 26 or 28 inch ke bich dolati thi
 "he drank his own juice mixture which was prepared from vegetables and fruits, apples, celery, carrots, etc
 in an electric blender," he said
 They took green vegetables, fruits and fresh milk every day

 Joe Weider, founder of Mr
 Olympia, defined Lee's body as "the best defined body I've ever seen!" Many of the top bodybuilding competitors have acknowledged Lee as a major influence on their careers, including Flex Wheeler, Sean Ray, Rachel mcleish, Lou Ferigno, Lenda Murray, Dorian Yates, and eight-time Mr
 Olympia Lee henny
arnold Schwarzenegger and jean-claude van Dam were also influenced by Lee and Schwarzenegger said of his body: "bruce Lee had a very—i mean a very defined physique
 He had very little body fat
 i mean, he probably had one of the lowest body fat counts of any athlete
 And i think that's why he looked so unbelievable
" a doctor who knew Lee once stated that he was "muscular with squirrels and enthusiastic like a horse" and fit so much he had never seen anyone

 a type of wild cat found in the jungles of the African continent in the western part of India
 Felis caracal The caracal is a fiercely territorial medium-sized cat ranging over Western Asia and Africa
 The word caracal comes from the Turkish word "karakulak", meaning "black ear"
 In North India and Pakistan, the caracal is locally known as syahgosh or shyahgosh, which is a Persian-derived term meaning black ears
 Although it has traditionally had the alternative names Persian Lynx, Egyptian Lynx and African Lynx, it is no longer considered to be an actual lynx
 Instead, it is now believed to be closely related to the African golden cat and the Serval
 The caracal is classified as a small cat, yet is amongst the heaviest of all small cats, as well as the quickest, being nearly as fast as the serval
 The caracal is a slender, yet muscular, cat, with long legs and a short tail
 Males typically weigh 13 se 18 kilogram, while females weigh about 11 kilogram 
 The caracal resembles a Eurasian Lynx, and for a long time it was considered a close relative of the lynxes
 It has a tail nearly a third of its body length, and both sexes look the same
 The caracal is 65 se 90 centimetre in length, with a 30 centimetre tail
 Compared to lynxes, it has longer legs, shorter fur, and a slimmer appearance
 The color of the fur varies between wine-red, gray, or sand-colored
 Melanistic caracals also occur
 Young caracals bear reddish spots on the underside; adults do not have markings except for black spots above the eyes and small white patches around the eyes and nose
 Underparts of chin and body are white, and a narrow black line runs from the corner of the eye to the nose
 The pupils of a caracal's eyes contract to form circles rather than the slits found in most small cats
 The most conspicuous feature of the caracal is elongated, tufted black ears, which also explain the origin of its name, karakulak, Turkish for "black ear"
 a juvenile has black on the outside of the ears, which disappears as it becomes an adult
 Its ears, which it uses to locate prey, are controlled by 20 different muscles
 The feet of a caracal have numerous stiff hairs growing between the pads
 These probably help the animal walk on soft sand
 The jaw is short and equipped with powerful teeth
 About 92 percent of caracals lack the second upper premolar teeth
 The caracal is distributed over Africa and the Middle East
 Its chief habitat is dry steppes and semideserts, but it also inhabits woodlands, savannah, and scrub forest
 They generally prefer open country, so long as there is sufficient cover, in the form of bushes and rocks, from which to ambush prey
 Its life expectancy in the wild is 12 years, and 17 years in captivity
 The caracal may survive without drinking for a long period - the water demand is satisfied with the body fluids of its prey
 Since it is also surprisingly easy to tame, it has been used as a hunting cat in Iran and India
 Adult caracals dwell either alone or, less commonly, in pairs
 Females inhabit relatively small home ranges, varying from 5 se 57 varg kilometre, depending on the local availability of prey
 While the females actively defend their territory against other females, the males roam over much larger areas of 19 se 220 varg kilometre with considerable overlap
 Like other cats, caracals scent mark their territory
 They leave their faeces in visible locations, and also mark territory by spraying urine onto bushes or logs, or raking it into the ground with their hind feet
 Caracals hunt by stalking their prey, approaching within about 5 meter before suddenly sprinting and leaping
 They kill smaller prey with a bite to the nape of the neck, and larger animals by biting the throat and then raking with their claws
 Caracals sometimes cover their larger prey if they cannot consume the whole carcass in a single meal, and return to it later
 Some have even been observed to hide carcasses in trees
 It is best known for its spectacular skill at hunting birds, able to snatch a bird in flight, sometimes more than one at a time
 It can jump and climb exceptionally well, which enables it to catch hyraxes better than probably any other carnivore
 If no cover is available in which to conceal itself, a caracal may flatten itself against the ground and remain motionless, allowing its coat color to act as camouflage
 Caracals produce the usual range of sounds for cats, including growling, hissing, purring, and calling
 Unusually, they also make a barking sound, which is possibly used as a warning
 Mating may occur at any time of year; However, it is more likely to occur when prey is plentiful, which stimulates estrous in females
 The estrous cycle lasts two weeks, and is marked by the female spraying urine containing chemical cues advertising her receptivity to neighboring males
 The female typically mates with several males over the course of a number of days
 In some areas, males have been observed to fight aggressively for access to females and remain with her for several days to guard against rivals; in others, they appear to be less protective
 Copulation lasts anything from 90 seconds to ten minutes
 Gestation last 68–81 days, and litter size ranges from one to six kittens
 For litters born in their natural environment, the maximum number of kittens is three; However, larger litters are more likely to occur in captivity where nutrition needs are adequately met
 Before birth, the female prepares a den in a cave or other sheltered area, sometimes using the abandoned burrows of other animals
 At birth, the kittens are blind and helpless, weigh 198 to 250 grams, and have yellow to reddish brown fur with black markings
 The eyes open at around ten days, and the deciduous teeth have fully developed by fifty days
 The canines are the first permanent teeth to appear, at around four or five months, with the others following over the next six months
 Kittens are able to leave the birthing den at around one month old, and at about this time the mother will begin regularly moving them to new locations
 Kittens are weaned at about ten weeks, but may stay with their mother for up to one year, when they start to reach sexual maturity
 Life expectancy in the wild is twelve years, and seventeen years in captivity
 Caracals are often viewed as vermin by farmers in Africa as they may prey on domesticated livestock such as poultry and young sheep and goats
 Caracals are rarely seen in the wild despite their relative abundance, as they hide extremely well
 Game drives in countries such as Kenya and Botswana widely encounter other animals, but a sighting of a caracal is extremely rare
 Because it is so easily tamed, the caracal is sometimes kept as a pet and can adapt to living with humans
 The caracal has been hybridised with the domestic cat at the Moscow Zoo
