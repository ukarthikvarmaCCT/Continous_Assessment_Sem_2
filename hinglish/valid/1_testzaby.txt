 yah sangharsh bahut dinon tak chalata rahaa or angrejon ne apane pratidwandviyon par vijay praapt kii or san 1763 ke baad se unka koi prabal pratidwandi nahin rah gaya
 In the meantime, the British had also acquired some territories and the Nawabs who ruled in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Karnataka were puppets in the hands of the British
 un par yah baat acchhee tarah jaahir ho gai thi ki angrejon ne kuch pradesh bhi hastgat kar liye the or bengal, bihar urisa or karnataka main jo nawab rajya karte the ve angrejon ke haath kii kathputli the
 It was well known to them that they would be removed from opposing the British

 We should not forget the historical fact that British power in India started with the establishment of a trading company
 angrejon kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha tathaa cheshtaa bhi isi vyapaar kii raksha or vruddhi ke liye hui thi
 Before the nineteenth century England had very little authority over India and the influence of Western civilization and institutions was negligible here
 san 1750 se purv england main audyogic kranti bhi nahin aarambh hui thi
 England was a farming country like India before that
 us samay england ko aaj kii tarah apane maal ke liye videshon main bazaar kii khoj nahin kerani padati thi
 At that time only light things could be sent outside due to lack of facilities for transportation
 bharatvarsh se jo vyapaar us samay videshon se hota tha, usase bharat ko koi aarthik kshati bhi nahin thi
 In 1765, when the East India Company received the Diwali of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa from the Mughal emperor Shah Alam, it began to settle land and recover goods in these provinces
 is prakaar sabase pehle angrejon ne yahaan kii malgujari kii pratha main her-pher kiya
 At that time the language of correspondence was Persian

 divaani kii adaalaton main dharm shaastra or shahar anusaar panditon or maulaviyon kii salaah se angrej colector mukademon kaa faisla karte the
 When the East India Company decided to spend some on education, their first decision was in favor of Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit education
 banaras main sanskrit kalege or kalkatte main kalakatta madrasa kii sthapana kii gai
 Prizes were awarded to priests and clerics to print ancient books and write new books
 us samay isaayiyon ko company ke raaj main apane dharm ke prachaar karne kiya gaya
 At that time, Christians did not have the freedom to propagate their religion under the rule of the company
 bina company se license praapt kiye koi angrej na bharatvarsh main aakar bas saktaa tha or na jaaydaad kharid saktaa tha
 The officers of the company said that if the British would be allowed to settle here, then there is a possibility of rebellion from them; Because foreigners are not well acquainted with Indian religion and rituals, there is a lot of fear that they will not respect the sentiments of Indians properly
 deshki puraani pratha ke anusaar company apane rajya ke hindu or musalmaan dharm sthanon kaa prabandh or nirikshan karti thi
 The company was responsible for keeping track of the income of temples, mosques, imambaras and khanqahs, repairing buildings and arranging worship
 atharahavin shatabdi ke ant se england ke padariyon ne is vyavastha kaa virodh karnaa shuru kiya
 He said that being a Christian, the company could not take over the religious places of the heretics
 ve is baat kii bhi koshish kar rahe the ki isai dharm ke prachaar main company kii ore se koi baadha nahin honi chahie
 At that time the condition of native Christians was very lamentable
 yadi koi hindu yaa musalmaan isai ho jaataa tha to uskaa apni jaaydaad or bivi evam bacchon par koi haq nahin rah jaataa tha
 Indigenous Christians could not get large jobs in the precincts of Madras
 inako bhi hinduon ke dharmik krityon ke liye tex dena padataa tha
 Those who were caught in forced labor on the occasion of a rath yatra to pull Jagannath's chariot were sometimes Christians
 yadi ve is begaar se inkaar karte the to unako bent lagaae jate the
 The clergy of England said that Christians should not be compelled to do anything contrary to their religious faith and if no concessions could be made to them, they should at least be treated in the same way as would be done to other religions

 dhire-dhire is dal kaa prabhaav badhane laga or ant main isai padariyon kii maang ko bahut kuch ansh main puraa karnaa padaa
 As a result, you will not have to wash your hands from your property
 isaayiyon ko dharm prachaar kii bhi swatantraaa mil gai
 Now the language of the royal court became English and it was decided to encourage English education
 dharm-shaastra or sharah kaa angreji main anuwaad kiya gaya or ek ‘laa kamish’ niyukt kar ek nayaa dand vidhaan or anya nae kanoon taiyaar kiye gaye
 In 1853 AD, local committees were arranged and handed over to them
 san 1854 main adaalaton main jo thode bahut pandit or maulavee batch gaye the ve bhi hataa die gaye
 Thus the old institutions of the country were destroyed and Hindus and Muslims began to believe that the British wanted to convert them to Christianity
 inhen parivartanon kaa or dalhousie kii hadapney kii niti kaa yah fal hua ki san 1857 main ek badi kranti hui jise sipaahi vidroh kehete hai
 Before 1857, there was an industrial revolution in Europe
 is kranti main england sabakaa agua tha; kyonki usko bahut-si aisi suvidhaayen thim jo anya deshon ko praapt nahin thi
 England invented the steam instrument
 bharat ke vyapaar se england kii puunji bahut bad gai thi
 He had iron and coal matter
 kushal kaarigaron kii bhi kami na thi
 For this various reasons, England became a leader in this revolution
 england ke uttari hisse main jahaan loha tathaa koyala nikalataa tha vahaan kal kaarkaane sthapit hone lage
 Cities began to settle near factories
 england ke gharelu udyog-dhandhe nasht ho gaye
 Machines started producing goods on a large scale
 is maal kii khapat europe ke anya deshon main hone lagi
 The machine era began in other countries of Europe
 jyon-jyon europe ke anya deshon main nai pratha ke anusaar udyog vyavsaay kii vruddhi hone lagi, tyon-tyon england ko apane maal ke liye europe ke baahar bazaar talash karne kii aavashyaktaa prathit hone lagi
 India was under England, so with the help of political power, India was easily made a good market for English goods
 angreji shiksha ke kaaran dhire-dhire logon kii abhiruchi badal rahi thi
 European costumes and European living began to lure the English educated class
 bharat ek sabhy desh tha, isliye yahaan angreji maal kii khapat main vah kathinaayee nahin prathit hui jo africa ke asabhy yaa ardhsabhy pradeshon main anubhoot hui thi
 First of all, this new policy had an impact on India's textile trade
 mashin se taiyaar kiye hue maal kaa muqabla karnaa karghon par taiyaar kiye hue maal ke liye asambhav tha
 Gradually, India's diverse arts and industries began to perish
 bharat ke bhitari pradeshon main dur-dur maal pahunchane ke liye jagah-jagah rail kii sadaken nikaali gayi
 India's major ports Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were the first railroads in Dalhousie's time with a view to facilitating foreign trade, allied to the major cities of India
 england ko bharat ke kachche maal kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The raw material used to be sent to these ports was subsidized by the rail tax
 aantarik vyapaar kii vruddhi kii sarvatha upeksha kii jaati thi
 According to this policy, it was not intended for England to re-organization the industry business of India in a new way by taking advantage of new inventions
 vah bharat ko krishi pradhan desh hi banaae rakhana chahta tha, jisamen bharat se use har tarah kaa kaccha maal mili or uskaa taiyaar kiya maal bharat kharide
 Whenever the Indian government decided to encourage indigenous business, the Government of England opposed its decision and discouraged it in every way
 jab bharat main kapade kii milen khulne lageen or bhartiya sarkaar ko england se aanevaale kapade par chungi lagane kii aavashyaktaa hui, tab is chungi kaa lankashair ne ghor virodh kiya or jab unhone yah dekha ki hamaari vah baat maani na jaaegi to unhone bharat sarkaar ko is baat par vivash kiya ki bhartiya mil main taiyaar hue kapade par bhi chungi lagaai jaae, jisamen deshi milon ke liye pratisparddha karnaa sambhav na ho
 Many roads were also created by opening the Public Works Department, as a result of which foreign goods started reaching the markets of small towns and villages
 rail or sadakon ke nirmaan se bharat ke kachche maal ke niryaat main vruddhi ho gai or chizon kii keemat main jo antar paaya jaataa tha
 He started falling short
 kheti par bhi iskaa prabhaav padaa or log zyaadaatar aisi hi fasal bone lage jinka videsh main niryaat tha
 European traders, with the help of Indian laborers, started to plant tea, coffee, jute and indigo in India
 beesvin shatabdi ke paanchave dashak main bharatvarsh main agrejon kii bahut badi poonji lagi hui thi
 In the last fifty-sixty years, this capital grew very rapidly
 634 videshi companiyaan bharat main is samay kaarobaar kar rahi thim
 Their recovered capital was about seven and a half trillion rupees and there were 5194 companies registered in India and whose capital was 3 trillion rupees
 inamen se adhiktar angreji companiyaan thim
 The tithes of foreigners who went to England from India used to come to India every year
 vastra or lohe ke vyavsaay hi england ke pradhan vyavsaay the or british raajnneeti main inkaa prabhaav sabase adhik tha
 These occupations had the greatest interest in maintaining England's authority over India; Because almost five fifths of the goods they used to leave outside were consumed in India
 bharat kaa jo maal vilaayat jaataa tha uski keemat bhi kuch kam nahin thi
 England used to buy tea, jute, cotton, oilseeds, wool and leather every year from India
 yadi keval chaay kaa vichaar kiya jaae to 36 karod rupaya hoga
 It is clear from considering these things that as England's economic gains in India increased, its political interest also increased

 khaadya saamagree ke abhaav ke kaaran unhone 7 disambar ko aatmasamarpan kar diya

 vahaan ke kai granthon main euvachi ke anya jatiyon ke saath sangharsh tathaa apane nivasasthaan ko chhod pashchimi kshetra kii ore badhane or rajya sthapit karne kaa ullekh hai
 Originally from them, it appears that in about 176 BC, Mao Tanu, the ruler of Heung Nu, sent a message to the Chinese emperor that he had ousted Yuvachi and drove him into the area between Tunu Huang and Ki Lien
 euvachi pashchim kii ore badhate hue siwang ke kshetra main pahunche or unako vahaan se hataa diya
 Later the Yuvachi caste had to leave the area themselves due to Vasun's invasion

 In 126 BC, Chinese Ambassador Chang Kien found the race of Yuvachi on the river Akshu
 euvachi kii mukhya shakha ne aage chalakar pun: shako ko haraaya or kapish par adhikaar kar liya
 From this time, the historical relationship of Yuvachi caste begins with India

 In opposition to this, some scholars find no connection between the Yuichi and Kushan dynasty
 unka kathan he ki kushaan vastav main shaq jati ke hi ek ang the or yuichi ne jab shakon ko haraaya to isi vansh ke kuch pramukh sardaar yuichi main mil gaye
 Later Chinese historians did not understand the separation of these two nations
 kushaanon ke atirikt chaar or jatiyon ne yuichi aadhipaty sweekaar kar liya tha
 In fact, Yuichi's struggle with those castes named Heungnu and Nusun and the bloodshed of each other does not seem appropriate with Kujul Cadficz assuming his 'satyadharma Pramukh' title

 maharaj nandkumar bengal kaa ek sambhraant brahaman tha
 He was a faujdar of Hooghly during the time of Siraj-ud-daulah, the Nawab of Bengal
 march, san 1757 main angrejon ne jab francisiyon kii basti chandannagar par hamale kii taiyaari kii, to nawab sirajuddaula ne nandkumar ko ek badi sena ke saath francisiyon or vahaan kii bhartiya praja kii raksha ke liye turant chandranagar bhej diya tha
 But after getting bribe from the British, Nandkumar withdrew from the British army as soon as he reached Chandranagar
 uske hat jane se francisi kamjor pad gaye or chandranagar par angrejon kaa saralata se adhikaar ho gaya 
 In June 1757, the British, led by Clive by resorting to bribery and deception, defeated Siraj-ud-daula in the Battle of Plassey and made the traitor Mir Jafar the Nawab of Bengal
 baad main angrejon ne use bhi gaddi se utarkar uske damaad or mir kasim ko, bahut sa dhan paane ke vaade par, nawab bana diya
 Sometime later, due to the British policy of plunder, Mir Qasim was forced to fight with the British, but he was defeated in the battle
 jab 1763 itho main mir jafar dubaara nawab bana to usne maharaj nandkumar ko apana dewan banaaya
 Nandakumar now understood the tricks of the British
 isaliye usne bengal kii nawabi ko pusht karne ke liye mir jafar ko yah salaah di ki vah bengal kii soobedaari ke liye samrat shah alam or vajeer shujauddula ko prasann karke shahi farmaan hasil kar le
 Due to this, the Nawab could be freed from the clutches of the British
 isapar angrej nandkumar se chidh gaye
 When Mir Jafar died in February 1765, his son Nawab Najmuddaula ascended the throne
 usne nandkumar ko apana dewan rakhana chaha, lekin angrejon ne aisa nahin hone diya
 As a result, a worthy and loyal servant of the Nawab continued to leave his hand
 angrej governor warren hestings ne ab maharaj nandkumar ko hameshaa ke liye khatm kar dene kii yojana banaai
 Nawab Najmuddaula appointed a man named Muhammad Raza Khan as his Nayab
 hestings ne nandkumar ko bengal kaa naayab banane kaa laalach dekar use mohammad raja khan ke khilaaf kar diya tha
 In this greed, Nandkumar helped prove the charges of embezzlement on Raza Khan
 lekin kaam nikalne ke baad hestings nandkumar ko puraskrit karne bajaay uskaa virdohi ho gaya
 Nandkumar also now filed an application against Hastings to the Council of Calcutta, in which Hastings was accused of taking bribe and extorting money and recovering a lot of money from Munni Begum, mother of the Nawab of Murshidabad
 ye iljaam concil ke memberon ne yadhyapi sahi samajhe, tathaapi hestings ko koi dand nahin diya gaya
 Instead, Hastings in turn accused Nandkumar that five years ago in 1770, Nandkumar had made a forged document in a civil case
 jaalsaji kaa yah mukadruma mohanprasad naam ke ek vyakti dwaara kalkatte kii angreji `supreme court` main chalaaya gaya
 Chief Justice of the Court Sir Elijah was a childhood friend of Impey Warren Hastings
 nandkumar par jaalsaji kaa iljaam bilkul jhootha tha, jisko siddh karne ke liye farji gavaah khadey kiye gaye the
 In fact, the British and especially Hastings used to tease Nandakumar and this trial was done to eliminate him
 saat din is mukademe kii sunwaayee hui or ant main angreji adaalat ne nandkumar ko apradhi qaraar dekar use phaansi kii sajaa de di
 On 5 August 1776, Maharaj Nandkumar was hanged in Calcutta

 No single cause of autism has been discovered
 anushodhon ke anusaar otism hone ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai jaise- Narcissism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of narcissism are complex and it is unclear whether the cause of ASD is polygynous or rare mutations
 durlabh maamalon main, aatmavimoh ko un karkon se bhi joda gaya he jo janm sambandhi dosha ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Other proposed causes, childhood vaccines, are controversial and there is no scientific evidence

 Narcissism may be better understood by a group of specific symptoms than by a symptom
 mukhya lakshanon main shaamil hai saamaajik sampark main asamarthta, baatcheet karne main asamarthta, simit shauk or doharaav yukt vyavhaar he
 In other aspects, such as the strange way of eating, however, it is common but not necessary for diagnosis
 saamaajik vikaas aatmavimoh ke shikaar manushya saamaajik vyavhaar main asamarth hone ke saath hi duusare logon ke mantavyon ko samajhane main bhi asamarth hote hai is kaaran log aksar inhen gambhirtha se nahin lete
 Social disabilities last from childhood to adulthood
 otistic bachche saamaajik gatividhiyon ke prati udasin hote he, wo logo kii ore naa dekhte hai, naa muskuraate hai or zyaadaatar apana naam pukaare jane par bhi saamaanya: koi pratikriya nahin karte hai
 The behavior of autistic babies is even more shocking, they do not shake their eyes, and they often touch and shake the other person's hand to speak
 teen se paanch saal ke bachche aamtaur par saamaajik samaj nahin pradarshit karte he, bulaane par ekadam se pratikia nahin dete, bhaawanaaon ke prati asamvedansheel, mook vyavhaari or dusron ke saath mud jate hai
 Despite this, they remain attached to their primary caregiver

 Older children and adults with ASD perform very poorly in the test of recognizing faces and emotions

 Making friends and maintaining friends often prove difficult for the autistic child
 inke liye mitron kii sankhya nahin balki dosti kii gunvattta myne rakhti he
 There are plenty of stories about the anger and violence of people with ASD, but very few scientific studies
 yah simit aankade bataate hai ki aatmavimoh ke shikaar mand buddhi bachche hi aksar aakraamak yaa ugr hote he
 Dominic et al, interviewed parents of children with 67 ASD and concluded that two-thirds of children have such times in their lives when their behavior becomes very bad while one-third of children become aggressive, often Children who do not know the language properly are tantrums
 baalyavastha main saamaanya bacchon va otistic bacchon main kuch pramukh antar hote hai jinke aadhaar par is avasthaa kii pahchaan kii ja sakati he jaise ki- One third to half of the autistic people do not develop language comprehension and ability to speak to meet the needs of their daily life

 Autistic children may have difficulty in imaginative games and learning languages
 koi ek khaas doharaav aatmavimoh se sambadhit nahin he, lekin aatmavimoh in vyavhaaron ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Early detection of autism and immediate consultation with a psychiatrist is the first treatment
 otism ke lakshna dikhne par manochikitsak, manovaigyanik, yaa prashikshit special agucator se sampark karen
 Autism is a lifelong condition for which a drug search is on for complete treatment, so do not wander here and there for time to get information about it
 otism ek prakaar kii vikaas sambanghit beemaari he jise puri tarah to thik nahin kiya ja saktaa, parantu sahi prashikshan va paraamarsh ke dwaara rogi ko bahut kuch sikhaaya ja saktaa he, jo use apane roj ke jivan main apni dekharekh karne main madad karata he
 70% of the people with autism have mental retardation due to which they are not fully able to live a normal life, but if the mental impairment is not very high, then the person with autism can learn a lot
 kabhi-kabhi in bacchon main kuch aisi kaabiliyat bhi dekhi jaati hai jo saamaanya vayaktiyon kii samaj va pahuch se dur hoti hai
 a child with autism can be helped in the following ways- yadi baccha koi ek vyavhaar baar-baar karata he to use rokane ke liye use kuch aisi gatividhiyon main lagaaein jo use vyast rakhen taaki ve vyavhaar doharaa na sake, Sudakshin was the king of Kamboj

 kisi jeev athwa padaarth main samay ke saath ikatthe hone vaale parivartanon ko vriddhavastha yaa umr kaa badhanaa kehete hai
 Aging in humans reflects a multifaceted process of physical, mental, and social change
 samay ke saath vriddhavastha ke kuch aayam badhate or failte hai, jabaki anyon main giravat aati he
 For example, response time may decrease with age while information and intelligence about world events may increase
 anusandhan se pataa chalata he ki jivan ke antim daur main bhi shaareerik, maansik or saamaajik tarakkee or vikaas kii sambhaavnaaen maujuud hoti hai
 Age is an important part of all human societies, reflecting biological changes, but it also reflects cultural and social traditions
 umr ko aam taur par purna varshon ke anusaar - or chote bacchon ke liye maheenon main mapa jaataa he
 a person's birthday is often an important event
 mote taur par duniya bhar main 1,00,000 log umr sambandhi kaarnon kii vajah se marate hai
 The definition of "aging" is somewhat unclear
 "saarvbhaumik vriddhavastha" or "sambhavya vriddhavastha" main bhed kiye ja sakate he
 Chronological aging is arguably the simplest definition of how old a person is and can be distinguished from "social aging" and "biological aging"
 "asann vriddhavastha" or "vilambit vriddhavastha" main bhi antar he
 There have been occasional differences regarding the population of elderly people
 kabhi kabhi is aabaadi kaa vibhaajan yuva bujurgon, praudh bujurgon or atyadhik buudhe bujurgon ke bich kiya jaataa he
 However, the problem with this is that chronological age is not fully aligned with functional age, meaning that two people may be of the same age but have different mental and physical abilities
 Each country, government and NGO have different methods for classifying age
 samaaj main buudhe logon kii sankhya tathaa anupaat main vruddhi ko vruddh jansankhya kehete hai
 There are three possible reasons for the aging population: immigration, long life expectancy, and low birth rates
 Old age has a significant impact on society
 yuva log sabase adhik aparaadh karte hai, ve nai praudyogikiyon ko viksit karne or apnaane or shiksha kii jarurat ke liye raajnneetik or saamaajik badlaav karne ke adhik utsuk hote hai
 Elderly people want something different from society and government rather than young people and often their social values are also different
 vruddh logon dwaara mat dene kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he or isliye kai deshon main yuvaaon ko matdaan karne kii manaahi he
 Thus, the political influence of older people is relatively high
 saarvbhaumik maanviya anubhav hone ke baavjood, vriddhavastha kaa aupchaarik vishleshan sabase pehle 1532 main mohammad ebn usoof al-haraavi dwaara apni pustak "anul hayaat" main kiya gaya tha, jise madhyakaalin chikitsa or vigyaan kii ebn sina academy dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This book is based on old age and related issues
 "anul hayaat" kii mul pandulipi 1532 main lekhak mohammad ebn yusuf al-haraavi dwaara likhi gai thi
 There are said to be 4 copies of this old manuscript in various libraries of the world
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki is duniya main vriddhavastha par yah pehla lekh he
 After matching these four copies, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman edited and translated the manuscript in 2007
 sampadit pustak dwaara, aap jaan sakate hai ki kis prakaar ascharyajanak dhang se 500 saal pehle hi lekhak ne aahaar, paryaavaran or vriddhavastha main gharelu sthitiyon sahit sabhi prakaar ke vyavhaar or jivan style karkon par charchaa kii he
 He has also discussed the topic of which medicines can increase and decrease old age
 jeev vigyaan main, boodha hona umr badhane kii ek dasha yaa prakriya he
 Biological aging is a process in which isolated cells exhibit limited ability to divide into culture, while organism aging is called organismal aging
 purna navinikaran kii avadhi ke baad, orgenizmal budhaape ko tanaav ke prati pratikriya dene kii kshamta main kami, homeostatic asantulan or bimariyon ke badhate khatre dwaara pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 These changes of the irreversible chain inevitably end in death
 kuch shodhakarta budhaape ko ek rog maan rahe hai
 Since genes influencing age have been discovered, aging is also increasingly considered to be potentially "treatable" "conditions" like other genetic "effects"
 darasal, jivan main umr kaa badhanaa na roka ja sakane vaala gun he
 Instead, it is the result of a genetic program
 kai prajatiyon main umr badhane ke bahut kam sanket mili hai, jiske sarvshereshth udhaaharan bristolakon chid jaise ped, sterjan or rockfish jaisi machhlee, kwahog or samudri anemon or jhinge jaise aksherucay jeev hai
 In humans and other animals, biologic aging has been attributed to decreasing telomeres in each cell cycle, when telomeres are too short the cells die
 isliye hefilic kii bhavishyavaanee ke anusaar, telomar kii lambaai ek "aanvik ghadi" he
 The length of the telomere is sustained by the telomere enzyme in immortalized cells
 prayogshaala main, nashwar koshika rekhaon ko unke telomar jeenon ko sakriy karke amar kiya ja saktaa he, jo sabhi koshikaon main paaya jaataa he kintu kuch vishesh prakaar kii koshikaon main hi sakriy rahata he
 Cancer cells are required to have the property of multiplying multiples without immortalization
 cancer karkon ke prati yah mahatvapurn prakriya cancer ke 85% maamalon main lagu hoti he, jisame utparivartan dwaara telomar jeenon kaa purnsakriyan hota he
 Since this mutation is rare, the telomere "clock" can be seen as a defensive mechanism against cancer
 anusandhan darshata he ki ghadi prayek koshika ke nabhik main sthit honi chahie or aisi suchanaaen milin hai ki manushya ke gunasutron ke 23wein jode ke pehle yaa chauthe gunasutron ke jeenon main dderghaayu ghadi sthit ho sakati he
 Other genes that influence the aging process have been shown to have a significant effect on the life span of the sertin gene yeast and nematode
 khamir main arees2 jin kii bahutayat isaki umr ko kaaphi had tak badha detii he
 In addition to genetic relationships to life span, it has been observed that diet in many animals affects life to a large extent
 vishesh rup se, calories ghataane se chuhon kii jivan avadhi 50% tak badhati hui dekhi gai he
 Calorie binding also affects many other organisms in addition to mice, and according to a study done by the National Institutes of Health on rhesus monkeys can increase the life span in human-like animals, however a significant increase in life span occurs only if Calorie bonding should be started from the beginning of life
 Because, at the molecular level, age is counted by the number of repeats of cells rather than time, this effect of caloric binding can be maintained by decreasing cell growth and increasing the time frame of cells to fission
 vartmaan main dawa companiyaan bhojan kii khapat ko kam kiye bina calories bandhan ke jivan avadhi badhane vaale prabhaavon kii nakal karne vaale vikalp dhund rahi hai
 In his book 'how and Why We Age', Dr
 Hayphilic mentions a paradox of the caloric bond longevity enhancement theory for humans, according to data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging that leaning leads to no longevity
 ek jaanavar ke jivan ko aksar vibhinn aayu virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 However, since biological changes are slow and can vary within the same species, dates have been uncontrollably determined to identify the duration of life
 neeche die gaye maanav jivan avadhi ke vibhaajan sabhi samskritiyon ke liye maanya nahin hai: Age can also be divided by decade: 13 se 19 varsh kii umr ke logon ko tin yaa tinagers bhi kaha jaataa he
 Occasional terms such as "twentysomething", "thirtysomething", etc
 are also used to describe people by decade or age
 kuch samskritiyon main umr ko vyakt karne ke chaar dhang hai: vartmaan varsh sahit yaa iske bina varshon kii gananaa dwaara
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek hi vyakti ke liye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki uski aayu bees varsh he athwa vah apane jivan ke ikkisven varsh main pravesh kar chukaa he
 The first expression is commonly used in Russian culture, the latter is limited in use: it is used in the obituary for the age of a deceased person and for the age of an adult when it is necessary to indicate that How much / how big / was she compared to him
 saanskrithik or vyaktigat darshan ke aadhaar par, vriddhavastha ko ek avaanchhneeya ghatana ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jo sundarataa ko kam karti he or vyakti ko maut ke kareeb laati he; yaa phir ise gyaan ke sanchay, astitv ke chihn or ek sammaan yogya sthiti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Numerical age is important in some cases, while many consider life stages to be more important
 purvi asian aayu gananaa pashchimi samskruti main pai jane vaale aayu gananaa se alag he
 In traditional Chinese culture, a different type of method is used to determine the normal age, in addition to the method called zhousui, called zhusui
 jhusui vidhi main, janm ke samay logon kii aayu 0 kii bajaae 1 varsh hoti he, kyonki garbhaadhan avadhi ko pehle se hi jivan kaal kii shuruyaat mana jaataa he, tathaa ek anya antar aging de he: jhusui vasant mahotsav ke dauraan apana janmdin manaate hai, jabaki shuo an kii aayu apane janmdin par badhati he
 There are variations in many countries regarding the age at which a person legally becomes an adult

 This suggests that the impact by the older population on health care costs is not inevitable
 july 2007 tak, sanyukt rajya america main ek vishisht kaidi ke liye ek agency kii chikitsa laagat lagbhag 33 dollar prati din tak thi, jabaki buudhe kaidi ke liye yah laagat 100 dollar tak ho sakati he

 saamaajik samarthan or nijee niyantran sambhawatah do sabase mahatvapurn kaarak hai jo vayaskon ke swasthya, rugnataa or mrityu dar ke bare main bataate hai
 Other factors that may be related to the health and quality of life of the elderly include social relationships and health
 ek hi sevanivritti ghar ke vibhinn pakshon ke vyaktiyon ne kam mrityu dar jokhim or ucch satarkta kaa pradarshan kiya he or jahaan nivaasiyon kaa apane aas paas ke vaataavaran par adhik niyantran tha, vahaan swasthya kaa aatm-moolyankan kiya he, haalanki nijee niyantran kaa swasthya ke vishisht upayon par kam asar ho saktaa he
