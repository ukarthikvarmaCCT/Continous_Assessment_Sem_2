 In the campus of the country's prestigious university JNU, an incident of a fatal attack on a girl by a boy came about 3 months ago
 is ghatana ne jeenyu campus main mahilaon kii suraksha par sawaal khadey kar die the
 After this, the JNU administration conducted an online survey to know the safety of women and the attitudes of students on campus, which revealed many shocking facts
 survey main 53 fisadi chaatraon ne mana ki unako kabhi naa kabhi yon shoshan kaa saamana karnaa padaa he, vahiin 21 fisadi chaatraon ne khulaasa kiya ki unke relationships main gaali-galoch hoti he
 The survey also revealed that the incident on 31 July at the JNU campus has also had a profound impact
 kul 96 fisadi chaatr-chaatraon ne bataaya ki 31 july kii ghatana aaj bhi unke jehan main jinda he, jo abhi bhi unako daraati he
 Also, 42 per cent of girls and 62 per cent of boys feel that after this incident there will definitely be an impact on the relationship between boys and girls in the future
 jeenyu prashasan dwaara karaaye gayi is online survey main kul 528 chaatr-chaatraon ne hissaa liya, jinamein zyaadaatar sankhya research scollar chaatr-chaatraon kii rahi
 However, many organizations on campus also believe that JNU administration has failed to bring awareness to women safety even after several incidents on campus
 enesayuai chaatr netaa siraaj udama ne kaha ki campus main jiescash (gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment) jaisi kamity he, jo mahilaon ke liye kaam karti he lekin sachai yah he ki ve kuch nahin karte
 Although a 10-member committee constituted by the JNU administration has issued a report on women's safety and awareness on campus, the JNU administration has not done any work so far on the committee's suggestions
 narendra modi ke dobaaraa satta ke liye chune jane ke thik ek din baad jab ek kitaab der se sahi aapke haath aae, jiskaa sheershak 'hindu hone kaa arth' ho, to us ore dhyaan janaa lajimi he
 In the wave with which Modi has won across the country, many people are expressing apprehension of Hindutva becoming more aggressive
 par asal main hindol sengupta kii yah kitaab hindutv ko nae nazariye se dekhne kaa kone muhaiyaa karaati he
 One sense is that Hindutva gives a message of universality
 doosraa bhav yah bhi he ki hindutv ek prakaar ke unmaad kaa naam he jo musalamaanon ko nishaanaa banaata he
 Such a contradiction is not without reason
 phir bhi, main hindutv kaa arth gunatmak pad ke rup main lagaataa hum
 It means "hinduism", not Hinduism
 haalanki hindu dharm usamen shaamil he
 In such a situation, this book by Sengupta is very relevant, because in the present times it has become difficult to talk about religion, to talk about religion
 khaskar hindu dharm kii baat karte hi maamla sanjeeda hone lag jaataa he
 There are many chapters in the book and Sengupta establishes that the divinity is alive and inanimate and prevails everywhere, it is a confluence of wisdom and faith
 manushya prakruti kaa hi hissaa he, uskaa vijeta nahin kyonki sansar maanav ke upbhog ke liye hi nahin rachaa gaya he (iskaa arth he ki sirf manushya hi nahin, sabhi jeevon or vanaspatiyon yahaan tak ki bhoomi, jalsroton or vayumandal ke bhi apane adhikaar hai
 ) The writing of Hindol brings new definitions of Hindupan
 kitaab ke cover par hi likhaa he 'pracheen aasthaa, nai duniya or aap'
 It is obvious that instead of the labyrinth of history, the author is trying to present and express the true heart of Hinduism and Hinduism in simple ways
 is kitaab main sengupta ke nijee tajurbe hai or nae jamaane kii soch bhi he
 The book spans from Banaras temples to complex subjects
 kitaab kaa pehla adhyay he hinduon ke bare main kaise likhaa jaae? yah sawaal behad maujuun he or aisa lagata he ki is prashn ne khud sengupta ko kaaphi pareshaan kiya hoga
 The second chapter asks who is a Hindu and third, what is it that makes you a Hindu
 ye aise buniyadi sawaal hai jo ghor aakraamak or baichaiyn hindutv ke jhandabardaaron or aankh mundakar hindu shabd se hi ghrinaa karne waalon ke liye hi hai or unhen jarur padhanaa chahie
 But the seventh chapter of this book has been written on the basis of really little research, but which is my favorite subject, titled Does being Hindu mean your being vegetarian? Those who define Hindupan on this basis are completely wrong
 par is adhyay main sengupta puri tarah chook gaye hai
 He returns to cow slaughter directly after the meat and he thinks that the meat carnivore simply means beef eating
 machhlee khaanaa bhi maansaahaar he or hindu jivan style kaa hissaa he yah shaayad sengupta bhul gaye hai
 On the other hand, there are areas like Bengal, Assam Bihar where there is a custom of eating meat, especially fish
 to agar sengupta inaki taraf thodaa ishaara kar pate to kitaab gahari ban jaati
 Nevertheless, Sengupta truly deserves congratulations for this work with a broad and different view on Hinduism
 wo bhi bina kisi anaavashyak tikaa-tippanee ke vaigyanik tathyon ke saath apni baat kah jate hai

 kitabahindu hone kaa arthh pracheen aasthaa, nai duniya or aapprishth sankhyah182keemtah250 rupeprakashakahmanjul publicing house*** The results of Monday's by-election for Jind assembly seat in Haryana will be announced on Thursday

 On the back of leaving the Aam Aadmi Party, he said that he resigned so that he would again create a movement like Anna Hazare's movement
 unhone kaha ki ab ve punjab main nashe ke khilaaf ladengen or esajipisi (shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti) ko raajnneetik party se mukt karaayenge
 In a press conference on Friday, HS Phoolka said that because of Anna's movement people went into politics, now they have come out
 ab main sanghathan kii shuruyaat punjab se karuunga
 Will fight against drugs SGPC kaaphi samay se ek political party ke kabje main he
 My plan is to set up an organization to fight against drugs in Punjab, to free SGPC from political possession
 unhone kaha ki khud SGPC chunaav nahin laduunga lekin sanghathan banaaungaa
 He also said that i will not contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 eches phulka ne kaha ki aaj se aath saal pehle jab desh main anna hajaare kaa andolan shuru hua to isse apane-apane kshetra ke samaaj sevak jude or ek sanghathan bana jo political party ke parelal khadaa ho gaya
 The country needed such an organization
 phir sochaa gaya ki isko political party main badal diya jaae jisase or zyada samaaj seva ho sake
 Phoolka said he learned a lot from the five-year experience, was reduced to just 19000 votes in the Lok Sabha and won the assembly by a large margin
 maine 1984 (1984 kaa sikh virdohi danga) ke liye netaa vipaksh kaa pad choda, aaj lag rahaa he vah faisla sahi tha
 Has been away from active politics for the past one year
 party kii kisi meeting main nahin gaya, bas apane kshetra (vidhansabha kshetra) main kaam kiya
 He said that the experience of five years of politics taught that the 2012 decision to change the movement into politics was not right
 aaj phir anna hajaare jaise andolan kii jarurat he
 There is a need for an organization that can tell truth as truth and falsehood as false
 jab vah sanghathan bole to political partiyaan sunne ko majaboor hon
 When this reporter asked Phoolka that you were talking about an organization that told the truth, told the lie
 aap nashe se ladane kii bhi baat kar rahe ho
 So is the Aam Aadmi Party not working on these issues or this way? To this, Phoolka said 'no comments' that HS Phoolka fought a legal battle for the victims of the 1984 anti-sikh riots
 is saal loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress or aap ke bich gathbandhan kii sambhaavna ko lekar chal rahi atakalon ke bich unhone aam aadmi party chhod di
 Meanwhile, in Charkhi Dadri, Arvind Kejriwal said that AAP leader of Punjab HS Phoolka no longer wants to do politics, so he has resigned
 phulka ne unase dilli main mulaakaat kii
 Kejriwal said that i have come here to honor martyrs, not politics
 unhone piem modi ke gurdaspur se loksabhaa chunaav kaa prachaar shuru karne par koi pratikriya nahin di

 She was married to Priyanka Gandhi in the same year
 yah kaarobaar munaafe vaala tha, lekin bahut zyada phaayde vaala nahin
 Vadra wanted to move fast and wanted to go very far
 jaldi hi unhen mauka mil gaya
 In 2008, Sky Light Hospitality launched dlf's residential project Primus 3 in Manesar

 Most of the money for this purchase was sourced from two sources: 7 received from Public Sector Corporation Bank in 2007-08

 Loan of sky lite kaa ped ap equity capital (chuktaa share puunji) sirf 5 lakh ru
 Was and did not have any source of income, it is a matter of intense scrutiny from Corporation Bank that he got such an overdraft

 unhone apane rahasmay sandesh main kaha tha, ''main jinase bhi pyaar karata tha un logon ko kho chukaa hum isse bura kya ho saktaa he?'vastav main yah baat to he
 Many of his close relatives have died unnaturally
 kuch april, 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav ke maahaul main unke pita rajinder yusuf sarai ke ek motel main mrit paae gaye
 His brother Richard is said to have committed suicide in September 2003 at the ancestral house in Moradabad
 wadra kii bahan mishael kii april, 2001 main dilli-jaipur hive par car durghatana main maut ho gai thi
 His Scottish-origin anglo-indian mother Maureen is still a director in all five of his companies
 bataaya jaataa he ki priyanka se shaadi ke baad wadra ke apane parivaar se rishte khattey ho gaye the or unhone janvari, 2002 main saarvajanik taur par ek kanoonee notice jari kar khud ko apane pita or bhai se alag kar liya tha
 After the disclosure of Kejriwal, speculation started about where Vadra was, he was said to be from Australia to Dubai
 unke ek kareebi sahyogi manoj aroda ne 9 oktober ko india today ko bataaya, 'aaj kii baat karen to ve yaheen bharat main hai
 Arora also told that Vadra is in his office at 268, Sukhdev Vihar
 wadra kii paanchon companiyon ke liye yahi pataa darj he
 Arora asked the opposite question, 'vaa dra is not going to give any statement
 aakhir kehane ke liye bachaa kya he?'wadra ke anya korporate companiyon ke saath rishton par abhi kejariwal ne kuch nahin kaha he, lekin congressiyon ko bhi ab jigyaasa hone lagi he: kya yah sirf shuruyaat he, iskaa ant kitna bura hoga? congress ke ek saansad kehete hai, ''in khulaason main koi nai baat nahin he
 But this will strengthen the perception of corruption against the government
 ' india today ne ek aavaran katha chhapakar is bare main bane chuppibhre shadyantr ko todaa tha, jab wadra ne uttar pradesh main chunaav abhiyaan ke bich apni patni or apane liye rajnatik jagah kii maang kii thi
 The Congress fears that the immediate impact of the Vadra bomb may affect the party's prospects in the Gujarat Assembly elections
 is maamle main bijepi ne lambey samay se khamoshi odh rakhi thi lekin arun jetali ne khamoshi todate hue kaha ki upie sarkaar ''tham parivaar ko bachaane ke liye kud padi he
 He said, "the current crisis is being used to show loyalty rather than to promote honesty
" ' vaise, is tathy se congress ko thodi raahat mili he ki bijepi ne is paariwarik scandle ko jor-shor se nahin uthaaya he
 Actually BJP has its own problems
 vah nahin chaahati ki bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne kaa shrey kejariwal ko mili, khaskar use yah bhi dar he ki kejariwal khud uske ek netaa ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 The Congress is losing this battle completely with its failures
 kejariwal dwaara har kuch din ke baad nayaa khulaasa kar surkhiyon main bane rahane kii koshish par sawaal uthaakar ve asal main bas shikaayat karte hi rah ja rahe hai
 Kejriwal says that he is not going to back down
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe in sabaki pushti kerani hogi or unki cross checking kerani hogi
 Only then can i make them public
 aakhir yah meri vishwasaneeyata kaa sawaal he
 'congress wants to see this credibility destroyed
 congress ke ranneetikaar ahamed patel ko 5 oktober ko hi pataa chal gaya tha ki kejariwal wadra ko nishaanaa banane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Team Kejriwal had indicated that they were going to reveal 'someone associated with the Congress who has no political office
 'patel ne sonia or rahul se baat kii
 Rahul was in Kashmir that day
 patel, sonia, rahul, priyanka or rahul ke sahyogi kanishka singh ne milakar party ke liye bachaav kii ranneeti taiyaar kii
 It was decided that no one from the family would react
 isaki jagah party wadra kaa aakraamak tareeke se bachaav karegi or yah daawa kiya jayega ki yah paroksh rup se sonia par hamalaa he
 Accordingly, Patel set the names of leaders to defend the party: Salman Khurshid, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rajiv Shukla and Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni
 unhone party ke media cell ke prabharee janardan dvivedi se bhi baat kii
 The problem was that the people of the party themselves did not know to what extent Vadra was involved in business and no one dared to ask
 congress kaa bachaav do tarah ke rukh ke bich main gum rahaa tha
 The first reaction was that Vadra is a common man, he is not a leader
 iske jawaab main kejariwal and company ne kaha ki wadra bharat kii sabase taqatvar netaa ke damaad hai
 The next day the Congress changed its stand and claimed that Vadra and his real estate company were not given any benefit in return for the loan given by DLF
 congress ne 6 oktober ko ek duusare tarah kii khabar jari kar media kaa dhyaan bhatakaane kii koshish kii thi
 a statement issued from the Prime Minister's Office that afternoon strongly denied that the government had spent money for Sonia Gandhi's foreign tours
 usee din shaam 4 baje dvivedi achaanak bina tay kaarykram ke 24 akbar road par hone vaale party ke dainik media brifing main pahunch gaye or kejariwal ke india against karpshan dwaara bijepi pramukh nitin gadakari par lagaae gaye aaropon par pratikriya deni shuru kar di
 But once Kejriwal started targeting Press Sonia's son-in-law at five and a half hours, there was only one headline left in the media
 tippaneekaron (khaskar congress kaa virodh karne waalon) ne gandhi parivaar kii bakhiya oodhedsa shuru kar diya
 Rajya Sabha MP Rajiv Chandrasekhar wrote in a letter about Vadra syndrome, 'political entrepreneurship in which people join leaders or are mainly involved in politics so that a new kind of venture capital can be created
 ' yah kroni capitalism se ek kadam upar he
 It has had a serious political impact
 upie sarkaar ko bachaane vaale uske sahyogi dal jaise mayawati or mulaayam singh yadav wadra-dlef gathjod kii jaanch karne kii maang kaa saath dene ko majaboor hue hai
 The most acute effect of this has been on the credibility of the Congress itself, which has been overwhelmed by the possibility of the voters falling apart
 ek aisi party jo phir se satta main aane kii taiyaari kar rahi thi, use ab agle aam chunaav main barbaadi kii gambhir ashanka dikhne lagi he
 The reactions of the people can be seen clearly and people are giving various kinds of responses, ranging from jokes to SMS and filing of PIL based on the documents made public by Arvind Kejriwal
 ab jabaki keechad zyada fail chukaa he, ek cheez najadik aati dikh rahi he: loksabhaa chunaav

 unhone mig-21 bison ko akele hi udaaya
 This was his first such flight
 karan johar kii berthde party main koi unase limlite chura le gaya
 By the way, it is not one, but two star kids
 ye hai aryan khan or sara ali khan
 Recently Karan Johar hosted a birthday party at his house
 isaki host thim aalia bhatta or is maukey par puraa bollywood pahunchaa tha
 While Karan's party should have been seen on him, Shahrukh's son and saif-kareena's daughter, who were spending time together in the party, were all watching with surprise
 karan johar kii berthde party ek photo saamne ai he jisamen aryan, shahrukh or sara najar aa rahe hai
 Of course, the comfort level of the three together is telling that friendship is good
 or yaheen se aapako bhi andaja lag jayega ki aryan or sara kii jodi khub jamegi bhi
 In Karan Johar's will, Shahrukh Khan's children's names, What is Majra! Karan will launch aryan-sara Koran In an interview, Karan Johar said that he will launch Shah Rukh's son Aryan
 vahiin shahrukh kii khwaahish bhi yahi he ki aryan ko karan hi launch karen
 Sara Ali Khan was seen walking around with the hands of this actor and Kareena also wants Sara to debut in Karan's film
 shahrukh or karina, donon hi karan ke saath filmein kar chuke hai or unke tallent ko bakhubi jaanate bhi hai
 However, it is interesting to see when both parents want to launch their children with Karan's film, then why not get both of them to enter Bollywood with the same film
 vaise jab tak karan khud is baat ko anouns nahin karte, is par kuch kahana mushkil hi he
 But this much we can say that seeing this pair, Karan should work on it soon
 bibar ko copy karata he shahrukh khan kaa betaa, dekhen photoslekina sara ke debyue kii ho rahi he charchavaise sara ali khan ko lekar ek baat or saamne ai he ki wo jald hi sushant singh rajput kii aane vali film se apana debyue karengi
 The film will be directed by director Abhishek Kapoor, who made a brilliant film like Kai Po Chhe and the film will be from the production house of Ekta Kapoor

 hamaare desh main na khul kar prem karnaa aasaan he or na hi prem ke baad shaadi kar daampaty jivan kaa hansi-khushi majaa lenaa
 There are surnames related to every caste and the cases of girls are even different
 yahaan ladakiyon ko shaadi ke baad sarnem badalanaa hota he
 Not only this, since the birth of children one has to carry the surname of the respective caste-fraternity and patriarchy, but the sentence we are going to mention here is totally different
 yahaan bachche ko pitrusatta ke bajaay matrusatta kii ore se sarnem mila he
 This story is different from the common stories because in the whole world it is seen that children have to live with the surname of patriarchy
 haalanki yahaan maamla ulat gaya
 The parents, by mutual understanding, preferred motherhood instead of patriarchy in the child's surname
 hospital main berth certificate par khadey hue sawaal
 
 
 Significantly, this couple's child was born on a foreign land
 isaki vajah se unhen pehle se hi pataa tha ki maa mail bachche ko janm dene ja rahi he
 The couple had already considered the child's name for this reason
 unhone uskaa naam nirvana rakhane kaa faisla liya tha
 After the birth of the child, when it was the turn to get the hospital Sebarth certificate, the couple put forward the mother's surname with the child's name
 is par hospital athurity ne unase phir se conform karne ko kaha
 When he confirmed this again, then he issued a certificate accordingly
 patni pehle se bhi apana gharelu sarnem likhti rahi hai
 
 
 Looking at the Indian tradition, we find that the girl's surname changes after marriage here
 ladki kisi shaks kii patni banate hi sambandhit shaks kaa tital apane naam ke saath jod leti he
 However, the girl's surname is Khamsera and she did not renounce her surname
 saath hi bachche ke sarnem main bhi khaabia (pita ke sarnem) ke bajaay khamasera sarnem he
 Now the child's official name is Nirwan Khamsera
 is bich ve kehete hai ki unhen bachche ke sarnem se koi fark nahin padataa
 Their child is just nirvana for them
 duniyavi jaruraton ke liye unhen sarnem lagaana padaa
 Mother-in-law has full cooperation on behalf
 
 
 aisa hamaare samaaj main kam hi dekha jaataa he ki bade-buudhe aise maukon par nai peedi kaa saath de rahe hon, lekin yahaan maamla bilkul ulat rahaa he
 First, when the daughter-in-law did not change her surname, and when the child was given the surname on behalf of the mother
 bachche ke dada-daadi is baat se hi khush hai ki unka pota swasth or hansi-khushi he or ve uski har sambhav madad kar rahe hai
 Comrade Somnath Chatterjee died at the age of 89 in a hospital in Kolkata
 commered chatarji pashchim bengal se marxvaadi communist party of india (sipiem) ke tikat par 10 baar loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye
 Comrade Chatterjee, a Lok Sabha member, had a critical moment in politics when in 2004 the UPA-1 government led by Manmohan Singh elected him as the Lok Sabha speaker
 upie-1 sarkaar ko sipiem baahar se samarthan de rahi thi
 After forming the government in 2004, Congress President Sonia Gandhi proposed to make Comrade Somnath Chatterjee the speaker
 unke is prastaav kaa samarthan pashchim bengal se hi varisht congress netaa pranav mukherjee ne kiya
 The special thing is that Somnath Chatterjee is among those Lok Sabha speakers of the country who got the support of all parties
 2004 main congress se aae pehle prastaav ke baad loksabhaa main commered chatarji ko spikar banane ke liye doosraa prastaav purv pradhanmantri or bijepi netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa aayaa jiskaa bijepi netaa laal krishna adwani ne samarthan kiya
 Apart from these, other big and small regional parties also supported Comrade Chatterjee as Speaker and he unanimously became the Speaker of the Fourteenth Lok Sabha
 ise padhein: modi sarkaar kii aarthik niti par rahul kaa waar, kaha- sarkaar bani to badal denge gstbawora loksabhaa spikar, commered chatarji sadan ke sanchaalan, sadan main sadasyon se samvaad ke liye hameshaa surkhiyon main rahe
 He used to express his views as Speaker in Parliament
 sabhi choti-badi partiyon ke sadasyon kii baat ko baariki se sunate aksar vah loksabhaa tivi par dekhe jate
 Apart from this, there have been many occasions when Comrade Chatterjee talked about his resignation in the face of the ongoing uproar in the House
 haalanki sadan kii garima ko banaae rakhane main khaas yogadan dete hue commered chatarji apane aacharan main puri tarah se dalgat raajnneeti se upar dikhe
 Direct evidence of this behavior of Comrade Chatterjee was found after the CPM withdrew support to the Manmohan Singh government in 2008 after the 123 Agreement between India and the US in the field of nuclear energy
 haalanki commered chatarji ne sipiem ke is faisle ko nahin maanate hue spikar ke pad se istipha dene se manaa kar diya
 As a result, he was expelled from the party by the CPM
 commered somnath chatarji 4 saal 361 din tak loksabhaa ke spikar rahe
 Comrade Chatterjee gave his message to the country clearly
 vah commered hai
 The responsibility of the Lok Sabha speaker elevates him above party politics and hence, he cannot leave his post due to political decisions
 maatra or gunvattta ke bich asantulan bhari jaddojahad pichley ek dashak main bhartiya ucch shiksha kshetra kii asal nirnaayak kahani rahi he
 There are an astonishing 694 universities in India from which about 5 million graduates are released every year
 pichley saal iity-guwahati ke times ajukeshans survey ke 50 saal puraane top 100 vishvavidhyalayon main shaamil hone se pehle tak kisi bhi bhartiya vishvavidhyalay ko vishwastareey nahin mana jaataa tha
 However, there are signs that things are slowly improving
 is saal prakashit cues world uniwarsity ranking main asia ke top-300 vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi main 17 bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Similarly, in the ranking of Top 100 Universities of BRICS (brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries made for the first time, 16 institutions from India have got a place, out of which five have been placed in the top 20
 research infrastracchar, skill deveopment kii koshish or videshi saajhedaari jaise kai tareekon se desh ke puraane vishvavidhyalay apni academik peshkash ko antarrashtriya str kaa bana rahe hai
 However, they still have a long way to go
 jeenyu ke vaais-chancelar sudhir sopori kehete hai, ''global ranking main research, khaskar interdiciplinary research par kaaphi jor diya jaataa he
 Compared to our foreign counterparts, we are far behind in terms of number of research papers, journals and projects published every year

 is tarah bharat ke top vishvavidhyalayon kaa bhi research ke maamle main nateeja bahut feekaa rahaa he
 "in America, we get a lot of funding from industry partners," says Pradeep Khosla, Chancellor, University of California, San Diego
 bharat main yah concept abhi shuruaati daur main he
 Even in government universities, it practically does not exist
 research ke liye funding ke maukey badhaane ke vaaste sarkaar, udyog or academik jagat ke bich sampark sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 We need to give more recognition to researchers early in their careers
 kisi ko apane kaam par sammaan milane ke liye 60 saal tak intjaar kyon karnaa pade? is kshetra main lage yuvaaon ko protsaahit or prerit karne kii jarurat he taaki ve apane project par kaam karte rahen or apane sapanom ko puraa karen
 âuniversities are also tying up with international institutes to tackle research bottlenecks in the country
 pichley saal vibhinn collejon or vibhaagon ne kareeb 500 videshi qaraar par dastakhat kiye
 Each such partnership gives faculty and students access to such high-level foreign resources, many of which have never been found in India
 pichley saal ek research exange program ke tahat plajo (paris) sthit echol polytechnic jane vaale 25 varshiya arnab bose kehete hai, ''france main meri research ko lekar jis tarah kaa sahyog or dilchaspee dikhaai gai use bayaan karne ke liye mere paas shabd nahin hai
 Not only did i get a separate place to work, but special laboratories and equipment were booked for me
 aise unnat buniyadi dhaanche or prerak maahaul kii to hamaare desh main ab bhi kami he
 It definitely needs to be changed
 â(campus main aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke chaatr)unke dost 27 varshiya jayadeep singh bhi is baat se puri tarah sahamat hai
 Singh, who joined the summer program at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, was stunned by the research infrastructure of a country which is not even equal to one-fourth of India
 jayadeep bataate hai, ''aisi choti-si jagah par bhi innovations or rachanaatmakataa ke liye jis tarah kaa samarpan dikhaa vah athulaneey he
 There are round the clock research guides to help you and if you need any special equipment, the institute can try to any extent to make it available
 vahaan funding ke maamle main na to lanbaa intjaar hota he or na hi deree
 "however, the way change is accepted abroad, it seems that Indian universities are not ready to accept the change as easily

 The renovation of many old classrooms and buildings at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) has not yet been allowed
 dilli uniwarsity ke vaais-chancelar dinesh singh kehete hai, ''nishchit rup se ham tatkaal harvard yaa emity ke str tak chalaang nahin laga sakate
 Academic structure varies in different countries
 bharat main kuch nayaa karne kii prakriya kaaphi thakaaoo, jatil or dhimi he
 Despite criticism, Dinesh Singh remains firm about his university's FYUP initiative
 vaais-chancelar dinesh singh kehete hai, ''main nahin samajhataa ki kisi chaatr ko sirf ek vishay padhgaye ko majaboor karnaa uchit he
 By increasing his contact with various subjects, you generate not only information but also curiosity

 Whether it is an agreement with the Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises to set up incubation units in various colleges or alliances with the National Skill Development Corporation for practical training, Indian universities are doing a great job in making their students more employable

 (chaatro ke saath bits-pilaani ke adhyaaapak)ucch shiksha ke ranneetikaar or world ajukeshan services main chif nolej officer rahul chaudaha kehete hai, ''hamaare lagbhag sabhi top vishvavidhyalayon main, chaahe ve sarkari hon yaa nijee, aaj placement kii dar 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gai he
 Educated students no longer have the problem of getting employment as much as getting admission in a university
 philhal desh main sakal namakan anupaat (gros enrolment resho) kareeb 20 fisadi he jo duniya ke sabase kam anupaat main se he
 This shows that not only is there a lack of incentive for students to pursue higher education, but there is also a lack of quality universities

 Sunil Galgotia, founder of Galgotias Group of Institutions, says, "if you notice, all the top universities abroad are private sector
 haalanki, bharat main bahut log yah tathy sweekaar nahin karte or gunvattta kaa paimaana is baat ko maanate hai ki koi vishvavidhyalay kitna purana he
 Many universities are only a few years old, but they have better infrastructure, placement facilities and faculty than hundreds of years old universities
 haalanki, aakhirkaar maansikta badal rahi he or ab chaatr kisi nijee santhaan main jane main hichakate nahin hai
 This year's India today-nielsen Best University Survey gives an idea of the changing picture of higher education
 vishvavidhyalay ab innovations karnaa chaahate hai or lambey samay se jari ekadhikaar ko toduya chaahate hai
 Although public sector universities still hold the top rank, six new universities have made it to the top 45
 inamen tripura vishvavidhyalay, modi institute of science and technology, saurashtra uniwarsity, dekan college (pune), dow
 Hari Singh Gaur University and Rashtriya Sant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University
 is surveykshan se yah sanket bhi miltaa he ki nijee vishvavidhyalayon ke str main kul milakar sudhaar hua he or unki ranking sudhari he
 Amity University has moved from 21st position to 19th, BITS Pilani from 15th to 13th and SRM Institute of Science and Technology from 42nd to 32nd
 simbyosis international uniwarsity, pune ne 30wein sthaan par aakar is rekking main phir jagah banaai he
 However, the government universities at the top are fully dominated
 dilli uniwarsity lagaataar paanchaven saal pehle sthaan par bani hui he, jabaki kalakatta uniwarsity bhi duusare sthaan par kaayam he
 Banaras Hindu University has jumped one place to third position, while Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has slipped one place to the fourth position
 hyderabad uniwarsity chathe se paanchaven sthaan par pahunch gai he
 According to the Best College Survey, this year's results show that a lively competitive environment has been created in which even less reputable universities are adopting more innovative methods for teaching and research and their emphasis is on preparing students for jobs
 nai chizon ko apnaane kii unamem jis tarah se laalasaa dikh rahi he uski vajah se puraane vishvavidhyalayon ko bhi apane chir-parichit daayre ko todgaye or apane sheersh mukaam ko banaae rakhane ke liye jujhna pad rahaa he
 The scale has risen everywhere and this is evident from India's best performance in the QS BRICS survey this year
 ab chunauti sambhraant qatari main jagah banane kii he
 (students on the campus of Christ University, Bangalore) How the rankings were given Based on actual and conceptual scores, the survey included 170 universities
 The Fifth India today-nielsen Best University survey examined 170 universities across the country to include arts, science And to determine the top 45 universities of commerce
 lambii suchi pehle kadam ke tahat survey ke liye vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi taiyaar karne ke liye desk research work kiya gaya
 Secondary data resources such as the Internet, published news and the Association of Indian Universities handbook were resorted to
 sirf unheen vishvavidhyalayon par vichaar kiya gaya jo arts, science or commers stream main kam se kam do post graduate course ofer karte hai
 Institutions of national importance in just one area, such as engineering, medicine, law or journalism, were not included in this survey
 is vajah se hi indian institute of technology (iity), ol india institute of medical sciensej (ames) yaa neshnal institute of technology (enity) jaise sansthaanon ko shuruaati suchi se hi baahar kar diya gaya
 Perceptual scores In the next phase, 349 experts from various streams (arts, Commerce and Science) were shown the list of universities and were asked to rate them based on certain parameters (based on their thinking)
 in visheshgyon (dean, register, vibhaagon ke pramukh, professor, reader) ko apane vishvavidhyalay kii reating karne kii ijaajat nahin di gai taaki pakshpaat na ho sake
 Standards such as reputation, academic input, faculty, research, student performance, infrastructure, innovation, governance, admission process, placement, global exposure and security systems were considered for this
 vaastavik ank avadharanatmak ranking ke aadhaar par top 85 vishvavidhyalayon ko shortlist kiya gaya or unase kai maanakon ke aadhaar par vaastavik aankade maange gaye
 They were asked for a variety of factual information such as admissions and student performance (national and international), infrastructure, placements, academic input, research and publication, awards (national and international), industry partnerships and faculty (national and international)
 jo vishvavidhyalay vaastavik aankade muhaiyaa karaane ko taiyaar nahin the unhen antim ranking prakriya main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 After this, the actual information related to all the universities was assessed and after that they were summed to get the overall actual score
 antim ranking har vishvavidhyalay ke antim ank hasil karne ke liye avadharanatmak aankadon ko 50 fisadi vettege or vaastavik aankadon ko bhi 50 fisadi vettege diya gaya
 After this, the total marks were indexed to 100 and finally the list of top 45 universities of the country was prepared
 tippanee: jo antim rank taiyaar hui vah avadharanatmak or vaastavik ankon ko shaamil kar bane kul ankon par aadhaarit he, na ki avadharanatmak yaa vaastavik ranking par
 Therefore, the final ranking of a university may be different from its own perceptual or actual rank

 annadramuk pramukh jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad o paneerselvam tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri bane hai
 Panneerselvam was in the role of interim chief minister for the last few days during Jayalalithaa's unwell
 paneerselvam ke nirdesh ke baad cabinet kii meeting main jayalalita kii tasviir rakhi jaati thi or jaruri faisle liye jate rahe
 Panneerselvam promised that he would leave his chair as soon as Jayalalithaa returns healthy
 haalanki, ab jayalalita kabhi lautne vaali nahin hai
 But the path of Panneerselvam, who was sworn in as CM for the third time, is not easy
 somvaar raat saadhe 11 baje jayalalita ke nidhan kii pushti hui or mahaj do ghante ke bheetar hi kareeb dedh baje ammaa ke behad kareeb paneerselvam ne tamilnadu ke 19venmukhyamantri ke taur par shapathali
 However, many senior leaders also raised questions about the swearing in of CM, what was the last hurry
 kaha gaya ki ek siem se duusare siem ko aasaani se satta hastataran kaa desh main yah pehla maamla he
 As soon as the news of Jayalalithaa's death was received, the people who were drowned in mourning did not even realize that their Chief Minister had changed
 to kya siem banane se paneerselvam ko jayalalita kii siyaasiviraasat kaa uttaradhikariman liya jaae
 It is not yet clear who is the real political heir of Jayalalithaa
 paneerselvam ko sansadeey dal kaa pramukh chunaa gaya tha
 However, the post of party general secretary is still vacant
 or aisi report he ki ammaa kii behad kareebi raheen shashikala kii nazren is pad par hai
 After Jayalalithaa's death, Sasikala's clan also appeared in Rajaji Hall
 kaha ja rahaa he ki satta ke liye khinchataan hui to party do faad bhi ho sakati he
 When Jayalalithaa was in command of power, Sasikala had a role in big decisions of the party
 rajya ke top beurocrats or police adhikariyon kii posting main shashikala kaa hi haath he or ye afasar shashikala ke vafaadaar bataae jate hai
 Sasikala is said to have the support of around 100 mlas out of the 135 mlas of AIADMK in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly
 inamen se adhiktar thevar samudaay ke hai jis samudaay ke paneerselvam or shashikala donon hi hai
 While Sasikala and her family were present in Rajaji Hall, their brothers are also active behind the scenes
 kaha jaataa he ki shashikala ke bhai party ke adhiktar vidhayakon ko apane paale main jutaney kii koshish main hai taaki vidhansabha or sarkaar par apni pakad banaai ja sake
 By the way, Panneerselvam has been the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu twice before
 lekin jayalalita ke baad vaale daur main is baar unhen khud ko ammaa kaa asli siyaasi vaaris sabit karne ke liye zyada mehnat kerani hogi
 The biggest challenge is to keep the party united
 kyonki abhi tak puri party sirf ek hi netaa ke id-gird gumti rahi he
 She was Jayalalithaa
 yah hakeekat he ki annadramuk main ek bhi aisa netaa nahin he jiske paas party ke sansthaapak emji ramchandran yaa phir jayalalita jaisi leadership skill ho
 When Jayalalitha was admitted to Apollo Hospital for 75 days, the government's work was almost at a standstill
 koi bhi bada faisla nahin liya gaya yaa koi bada elaan kiya gaya
 There are four years of AIADMK government in the state
 paneerselvam sarkaar ke saamne is morche par janata kaa dil jeetne kii chunauti bhi he
 Apart from this, how much AIADMK will be able to maintain 'brand Amma', it is also a challenge before the new government
 kyonki isi brands ammaa ne party ko soobe main phir se khadaa karne or satta tak pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 Till now the AIADMK has always been working under a supremo and caste and community centric local leaders have been working according to it
 jayalalita ke jane ke baad shaayad aisa nahin hoga
 Both Paneerselvam and Sasikala belong to the same community and a large population of this community resides in skilled Tamil Nadu
 kuch aise samudaay or netaa jo annadramuk ke prati vafaadaar rahe hai, ab khud ko upekshit mahasoos kar sakate hai
 There are many other sub-castes too who would like to preserve their political existence under the banner of AIADMK
 aise main jayalalita ke baad paneerselvam or annadramuk ke baad in tamaam samudaayon kaa bharosa hasil karnaa or unhen apana vafaadaar matadaata banaae rakhana bada chalange hoga
 Apart from these, good governance and corruption will be the biggest issues before the Panneerselvam government
 vafadari ko chhod diya jaae to paneerselvam ke paas ek chatur rajaneta kii quality dikhaai nahin detii
 Though he used to sell tea earlier like PM Modi, but his public image as Narendra Modi is difficult
 beete 15 saal ke dauraan, jab se wo pehali baar siem bane, ab tak siyasat kii duniya main paneerselvam ke jitne dost or prashansak bane, usase zyada kahin dushman bane hai
 All these enemies can unite and make it difficult for Panneerselvam

 Do i not believe in the existence of God Almighty, omnipresent and omniscient due to any ego? Some of my friends â perhaps by saying so â i am not gaining much authority over them â are eager to come to the conclusion that i am going too far ahead by denying the existence of God and my little contact with me

 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataaen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 Please do not even say that this is his entertainment
 nero ne bas ek rome jalaayaa tha
 He killed a small number of people
 usne to bahut thodaa dukh paidaa kiya, apane purna manoranjan ke liye
 And what is its place in history? By what name are historians called him? All venomous adjectives are heaped upon it
 nero ek hridayaheen, nirdayee, dusht
 a Genghis Khan took a few thousand lives for his enjoyment and today we hate his name
 tab kis prakaar tum apane ishwar ko nyyochit tehraate ho? us shaashvat nero ko, jo har din, har ghante ore har minute asankhya dukh detaa rahaa, or abhi bhi de rahaa he
 Then how do you think of taking the side of his misdeeds, which is more every moment than Genghis Khan? How long will you justify the person who dares to inflict wounds on our body so that soft and comfortable ointment will be applied later The i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal hai main tumse poochta hum ki us sarvashaktishaalee ne shabd dwaara vishwa ke utpatti ke liye chah din tak kyon parishram kiya?or prayek din vah kyon kahata he ki sab thik he? bulaao use aaj
 Show him past history

 You are silent thik he, to main aage chalata hum
 And you Hindus, you say that those who are suffering today, they are sinners of previous lives and today's tyrants were saintly men in past lives, so they are robbing the joy of power

 Its mission is to return the offender to society as a qualified and peaceful citizen
 kintu yadi ham manushyon ko apradhi maan bhi len, to ishwar dwaara unhen die gayi dand kii kya prakruti he? tum kehete ho vah unhen gaay, billi, ped, jadi-booti yaa jaanavar banaakar paidaa karata he
 You count 84 lakh such punishments
 main poochta hoon ki manushya par inkaa sudhaarak ke rup main kya asar he? tum aise kitne vyaktiyon se mili ho, jo yah kehete hai ki ve kisi paap ke kaaran purvajanm main gadhaa ke rup main paidaa hue the? ek bhi nahin? apane puraanon se udhaaharan na do
 i have no place for your mythology
 or phir kya tumhen pataa he ki duniya main sabase bada garibi he? yah ek dand he
 To what extent should i praise the punishment process, which inevitably compels a man to commit more crimes? My dear friends These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, poonji tathaa ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 i ask, why doesn't your all-powerful God stop every person when he is committing a sin or a crime? He can do this very easily
 usne angrejon ke mastishk main bharat ko mukt kar dene kii bhaavana kyon nahin paidaa kii?vah kyon nahin puunjipatiyon ke hriday main yah paropkaaree utsaah bhar detaa ki ve utpaadan ke sadhano par apana vyaktigat sampatti kaa adhikaar tyaag den or is prakaar keval sampoorn shramik samudaay, varan samast maanav samaaj ko poonjivadi bediyon se mukt karen? kahan he ishwar? kya vah manushya jati ke kashton kaa mazaa le rahaa he? ek nero, ek changez, uskaa naash ho!kya tum mujhase poochhate ho ki main is vishwa kii utpatti tathaa maanav kii utpatti kii vyakhya kaise karata hum? thik he, main tumhen bataata hum

 tumhaara doosraa tark yah ho saktaa he ki kyon ek baccha andhaa yaa langadaa paidaa hota he? kya yah uske purvajanm main kiye gayi kaaryon kaa fal nahin he? jeevigyaan vettaon ne is samasya kaa vaigyanik samaadhaan nikaal liya he
 All religions, sects, sects and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 When a man tries to stand on his feet and becomes realistic, then he should throw the reverence aside and face all the sufferings, troubles with manhood in which circumstances may strike him
 yahi aaj meri sthiti he
 This is not my ego, my friend! This is my way of thinking, which has made me an atheist
 ishwar main vishwaas or rose-ba-rose kii prarthana ko main manushya ke liye sabase swaarthee or gira hua kaam maanata hum
 We have to see how i can play, a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 'I said no, dear friend, it will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak tathaa bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hum
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hum
