 In fact, many attempts were made to destroy this temple during the rule of the Sultanate and the Mughal period
 First it was Alauddin Khilji, who destroyed the Gorakhnath temple in the 14th century and later it was converted into the Islamic of India in the 18th century
 Ruler Aurangzeb was destroyed

 Padmavati or Padmini was the queen of Ratna Singh, the king of Chittor
 is rajput rani ke naam kaa aitihaasik astitv bahut sandigdh he, or iskaa aitihaasik astitv to praayah itihaaskaaron dwaara kaalpanik sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 The main source of this name is the epic titled 'padmavat' by Malik Muhammad Jayasi
 anya jis kisi aitihaasik sroton yaa granthon main 'padmavati' yaa 'padmini' kaa varnan hua he ve sabhi 'padmavat' ke parvarti hai
 The name 'padmini' has been accepted mostly in the history texts, while Jayasi has explicitly accepted the name 'padmavati'
 jaaysi ke varnan se spasht hota he ki 'padmini' se unka bhi taatpary striyon kii ucchtam koti se hi he
 Jayasi has clearly written that King Gandharvasen had sixteen thousand Padmini queens, the best of which was Queen Champavati, who was Patarani
 isi champavati ke garbh se padmavati kaa janm hua tha
 Thus the name 'padmavati' is clearly accepted in the primary source of the story itself
 jaaysi ke anusaar padmavati sinhal dweep ke raja gandharvasen kii putree thi or chittod ke raja ratan sen yogi ke vesh main vahaan jaakar anek varshon ke praytn ke pashchaat uske saath vivaah kar ke use chittod le aayaa tha
 She was a unique beauty and Chittorgarh was invaded by the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji, upon hearing the description of her form by the poet-pundit-tantric Raghav Chetan, destined by Ratansen
 8 maah ke yuddh ke baad bhi allaudin khilji chittod par vijay praapt nahin kar sakaa to laut gaya or duusari baar akraman karke us ne chal se raja ratansen ko bandi banaaya or use lautaane kii shart ke rup main padmavati ko maanga
 Then deceit was also resorted to by Padmavati and with the help of gora-badal, King Ratansen was freed by being disguised with many heroes as Padmavati's associates in the palanquins
 parantu is chal kaa pataa chalate hi allaudin khilji ne prabal akraman kiya, jisamen dilli gayi praayah saare rajput yoddha maare gayi
 King Ratansen returned to Chittor but upon coming here he had to attack Kumbhalner and Devpal was killed in the war with Devpal, the ruler of Kumbhalner, but King Ratansen also returned to Chittor with great injuries and went to heaven
 udhar punah allaudin khilji kaa akraman hua
 Rani Padmavati along with sixteen hundred women was consumed by Jauhar and all the Rajput warriors were killed while opening the gate of the fort
 allaudin khilji ko raakh ke sivaa or kuch nahin mila
 Colonel Tod has repeated the same story in his history of Rajasthan with some manipulation in the above story of Jayasi
 mukhyatah bhaaton kii kathaon ke aadhaar par likhane ke kaaran karnal tod kaa varnan aitihaasik bahut kam rah gaya he
 He named Bhimsi instead of Raja Ratnasinh or Ratansen and he was also virtually Rana but not Rana Lakhmsi's uncle who was ruling the family as the child of Laxman Singh
 karnal tod ne lakshmana singh or uske sangrakshak ke rup main bhimsingh ke shashan kaa aarambh 1275 isvi main mana he; jabaki yah sarvagyaat baat he ki allaudin khilji kaa akraman 1303 isvi main hua tha
 Similarly, Col
 Tod has told Padmini the girl of Chauhan Vanshi Hamir Shankh of Sinhala Island
 in parivartanon ke sivaa shesh kahani apwaadon ko chhodkar praayah padmavat vaali hi he
 Rani Padmini is mentioned by Jain texts- Nabindanan Zenudhar, Chittai Charitra and Rayan Sehra between the 14th and 16th centuries
 tejpal singh dhama ne apane charchit shodhaparak upanyaas agni kii lapten main inhen jafana se prakashit granthon ke aadhaar par srilanka kii rajkumaari siddh kiya he
 His story is slightly different from Jayasi's Padmavat
 rani padmini, raja ratnasingh tathaa allaudin khilji ke akraman ko lekar itihaaskaaron ke bich kaaphi pehle se paryaapt manthan ho chukaa he
 In this context, the most quoted and certified Mahamaopadhyay Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha has been considered
 ojha ji ne padmavat kii katha ke sandarbh main spasht likhaa he ki "itihaas ke abhaav main logon ne padmavat ko aitihaasik pustak maan liya, parantu vastav main vah aajkal ke aitihaasik upanyaason kii si kavitabaddh katha he, jiskaa kalevar in aitihaasik baton par rachaa gaya he ki ratansen chittod kaa raja, padmini yaa padmavati uski raani or allaudin dilli kaa sultan tha, jisane ratansen se ladakar chittod kaa kila chhina tha
 Often everything else has been conceived to make the story interesting; Because Ratnasinha could not rule for a year, how can it be possible to become a yogi and go to Sinhaldwip and get married to the princess there
 uske samay sinhaladweep kaa raja gandharvasen nahin kintu raja kirtinishshank dev parakrambahu yaa bhuvnek bahu hona chahie
 There was no king named Gandharvasen in Sinhaldwip
 us samay tak kumbhalaner aabaad bhi nahin hua tha, to devpal vahaan kaa raja kaise mana jaay ? allaudin 8 baras tak chittod ke liye ladane ke baad niraash hokar dilli ko nahin lautaa kintu anumaan chah maheene lard kar usne chittod le liya tha, vah ek hi baar chittod par chadha tha, isliye duusari baar aane kii katha kalpit hi he
 " is prakaar yah spasht ho jaataa he ki jaaysi rachit padmavat mahakavy kii katha main aitihaasikta dhoondhna bahut had tak nirarthak hi he
 Some of the names are historical, but the events are mostly fictitious
 kuch ghatnaayen jo aitihaasik hai bhi unka sambandh 1303 isvi se na hokar 1531 isvi se he
 Similarly, the description of Colonel Todd is also largely historical
 is sandarbh main ojha ji kaa spasht kathan he ki "karnal tod ne yah katha visheshkar mewar ke bhaaton ke aadhaar par likhi he or bhaaton ne usko 'padmavat' se liya he
 Due to the absence of Ratnasinh behind Samar Singh in Bhat's books, Tad linked Padmini with Bhimsingh and considered it an incident of the time of Lakhmsi
 aise hi bhaaton ke kathananusaar taad ne lakhamasi kaa balak or mewar kaa raja hona bhi likh diya, parantu lakhamasi na to mewar kaa kabhi raja hua or na balak tha, kintu sisode kaa samant tha or us samay vriddhavastha ko pahunch chukaa tha, kyonki vah apane saat putron sahit apana namak adaa karne ke liye ratnasingh kii sena kaa mukhiya banakar allaudin ke saath kii ladaai main ladate hue maaraa gaya tha, jaisaa ki vikram samvath 1517 ke kumbhalgarh ke shilaalekh se upar batalaaya gaya he
 Similarly Bhimsi was not Lakhmsi's uncle, but grandfather, as found in the 'ekalingamahatmya' of Rana Kumbhakarna's time
 aisi dasha main taad kaa kathan bhi vishwaas ke yogya nahin ho saktaa
 If there is any root of the writings of 'padmavat', 'tithi Firishta' and the Rajasthan of Tad, it is only that Alauddin marched on Chittor and conquered it within six months' siege; King Ratnasinh was killed in this battle with many feudatories like Lakshman Singh, his queen Padmini along with many women died in the fire of Jauhar; Thus Chittor became a Muslim for a short time
 baaki bahudhaa sab baaten kalpana se khadi kii gai he
 " ojha ji ke bahu uddhrut uparyukt mat ko praayah sabhi itihaaskaaron ne sweekaar kiya he
 Dr
 Lal also wrote in his book 'history of the Khaljis, that after keeping the traditional narration of the story at bay, the naked truth is that Sultan Alauddin invaded Chittor in 1303 AD and after an eight-month long struggle he got it
 Authorized
 vir rajput yoddha aakrantaon se yuddh karte hue khet rahe or vir rajput striyaan johar kii jwaalaon main samadhisth ho gayin
 Amongst the women who became samadhi, there was possibly a queen of Ratnasinh, named Padmini
 in tathyon ke atirikt or sab kuch ek saahitiyik sanrachana he or uske liye aitihaasik samarthan nahin he
 Similar opinion is also of Dr
 SL Nagori and Jitesh Nagori
 yah chittod kaa pratham shaakaa mana gaya he
 It is said that Khilji hoisted his victory over the fort and killed 30,000 civilians there
 anek itihaaskaaron ne padmini ke naam tathaa astitv donon ko asweekaara he; parantu paryaapt vichaar ke baad dow0 aashirvadilal shrivastav tathaa dow0 gopinath sharma jaise anek itihaaskaaron ne kahani kii bahut si baton ko apramanik maanate hue bhi padmini ke astitv ko sweekrut kiya he, jaisaa ki ojha ji ke bhi uparyukt mat main vyakt hua he
 Dr
 Gopinath Sharma has written that "in our opinion, it is to be believed that the story tradition of Padmini begins with Padmavat of Jaisi, it is a complete illusion
 chhitaicharit main jo jaaysi se kai varshon purv likhaa gaya tha, padmini tathaa allaudin ke chittod akraman kaa varnan he
 In the blond-cloud quadrant of Haemartan; And this story has been written independently in the Padmini character of Labhodaya
 


 yah katha ek rajput pranali ke anuroop vishuddh tathaa swasth parampara ke rup main chali aayi he use sahaj main asweekaar karnaa thik nahin
 It is possible that many things have been practiced in different forms, from text to speech and from description style, but their basis cannot be found out from the truth
 sthapaty is baat kaa sakshi he ki chittod main padmini ke mahal hai or padmini taal he jo aaj bhi us vistrut tathaa vivadagrast mahila kii yaad dilaa rahe hai
 All the events given in relation to Padmini may not fit the test of truth, but the existence of Padmini, his understanding at the time of attack, the leadership of Jauhar fast by him, etc
, have an independent significance
 " In fact, the main reason for the invasion and war of Alauddin Khilji was the imperial ambition of Alauddin and the military and commercial utility of Chittor
 gujarat, malwa, madhya pradesh, sanyukt praant, sindh aadi bhaagon ke vyapaarik maarg chittod se hokar guzarate the
 It is natural that a sultan like Alauddin Khilji would definitely want to gain authority over such an area
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki chittod akraman ke liye allaudin kaa pramukh aashay raajnneetik tha, parantu jab padmini kii sundarataa kaa haal use maaloom hua to usko lene kii uthkanthaa usamen adhik teevr ho gayi
 In theory probability and statistics, the k chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom is the distribution of the sum of squares of the k standard independent random variables
 yah gamma vitaran kii ek vishesh maamla he or pariklpana pareekshan main yaa vishwaas antaraal ke nirmaan main, anumanik aankade, udaa main sabase vyapak rup se istemaal prayikta vitaran main se ek he
 When it is being distinguished from the more general chi-square distribution, this distribution is sometimes called the central chi-square distribution
 chi-varg bantan ek kii aabaadi ke maanak vichlan ke liye ek saidhantik ek, gunatmak data ke vargeekaran ke do maapdand kii swatantraaa ke liye ek manaaya vitaran ke feet kii bhalaai ke liye aam chi chuktaa pareekshanon main prayog kiya jaataa he, or vishwaas antaraal akalan main ek namoona maanak vichlan se saamaanya vitaran
 Many other statistical tests also use this distribution, like Friedman's analysis of variance from the group
 pareekshan main uthta he, dusron ke bich main
 The Kai-squared test of the goodness of fit of observed data to the criterion hypothetical distribution of chi squared independence in contingency tables Enter the likelihood ratio test survival analysis for nested models Rank test cochran-mantel test for stratified contingency tables T-distribution and F-distribution t tests, used in analysis of variance, and the definition of regression analysis Is a component of education
 praathmik kaaran he ki chi-varg bantan pariklpana pareekshan main bade paimaane par istemaal kiya jaataa he saamaanya vitaran ke liye apane rishte he
 Many hypothesis tests use a test statistic, such as the t statistic in a t test
 in pariklpana pareekshan ke liye, namoona aakaar ke rup main, en, bad jaati he, pareekshan aankada ke namoonay vitaran saamaanya vitaran drushtikon
 Because the test statistic is asymptotic normally distributed, provided the sample size is large enough, the distribution used for hypothesis testing is a normal distribution that can be estimated
 ek saamaanya vitaran kaa upyog kar pareekshan pariklpana acchhee tarah se samaj or apekshaakrit aasaan he
 The simplest chi-square distribution is the square of a standard normal distribution
 to jahaan bhi ek saamaanya vitaran ek pariklpana pareekshan ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, ek chi-varg bantan istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In particular, z seems to have been a standard normal random variable, with mean = 0 and variance = 1
 z ~ n
 ek namoona jed se yadrichhik par taiyaar vitaran maanak saamaanya vitaran ke graph main dikhaaya gaya he se ek namoona he
 Define a new random variable unstarred question to generate a random sample, and a value class to take a sample from z
 chuktaa mulyon kaa vitaran yadrichhik char kyuu = Z2 dwaara diya jaataa he
 {
 \ Displaystyle \ kyuu \ \ sim \ \ chi _ {1} ^ {2}} \ kyuu \ \ sim \ \ chi _ {1}: yadrichhik char kyuu ke vitaran ke ek chi-varg bantan kaa ek udhaaharan he ^ {2}
 The subscript 1 indicates that this particular chi-square distribution is constructed from only 1 standard normal distribution
 ek maanak saamaanya vitaran varg nikaalnaa An additional reason that the chi-squared distribution is widely used is that it is a member of the class of likelihood ratio tests LRT has many desirable properties
 vishesh rup se, elarti ke saamanytah shunya pariklpana asweekaar karne ke liye ucchtam shakti pradaan karte hai
 However, only the normal and chi squared estimates are valid asymptotic
 is kaaran se, yah tii vitaran ke bajaay saamaanya sanniktan yaa chota sa namoona aakaar ke liye chi chuktaa sanniktan kaa upyog karne ke liye behatar he
 Similarly, in the analysis of contingency tables, the chi squared approximation will deteriorate for small sample sizes, and it is preferable to use the Fisher exact test
 raimase or raimase chalata he ki sateek dwipad pareekshan hameshaa saamaanya sanniktan kii tulana main adhik shaktishaalee he
 This distribution was first described in the papers of 1875–6 by the German statistician Friedrich Robert Helmerratt, where he computed the sample distribution of the sample variance of a general population
 is prakaar german main is paramparaagat helmerat yaa "helmerat" vitaran" ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 The distribution is independently fitted, for which he developed his Pearson's kai-squared test, was rediscovered by the English mathematician Karl Pearson in reference to the published good in 1900, collected in the table of calculated values published in with
 naam "chi chuktaa" antat pearson kii ashulipi se greek akshar chi ke saath ek bahubhinnrupi saamaanya vitaran main pratipadak ke liye niklaa, kya -1⁄2xtς-1x ke rup main aadhunik sanketan main prakat hota he ke liye -1⁄2χ2 lekhan
 Ki's "chi squared distribution" is a family idea, but not because of Pearson, but originated in the 1920s as a further development due to Fisher
 dwaara kendriya seemaa prameya, kyonki chi-varg bantan parimit matlab or vicharan ke saath kashmir swatantra yadrichhik char kaa yoga he, yah bade kashmir ke liye ek saamaanya vitaran ke liye konvargis
 For many practical purposes, the> 50 distribution for k is close enough to a normal distribution for the difference to be ignored
 vishesh rup se, eks ~ χ2, to ke rup main kashmir anant ko jaataa he, kaa vitaran { \ displaystyle / { \ sqrt {2k}}} / { \ sqrt {2k}} ek maanak saamaanya vitaran ke liye jaataa he
 However, the convergence is slow as the asymmetry is { \ displaystyle { \ sqrt {8 / k}}} { \ sqrt {8 / k}} and additional kurtosis / k

en

 Other functions of chi-square distribution converge more rapidly to a normal distribution

 The reason for this was simply the discrimination between black gore
 yadi pratipakshi kii shakti hamase adhik he to sashastr virodh kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa ve ahimsha ko maanate the isliye ve yah ladaai lard rahe the 
 In order to avoid strong rivalry, the strategy of "disarmament resistance" was used
 england main striyon ne matadhikaar praapt karne ke liye isi "niskriy pratirodh' kaa maarg apanaaya tha
 Thus in retaliation, it was considered appropriate to harass the opponent by attacking him with weapons in every other way, to harm him by deceit, or to demean him by making an alliance with his enemy
 gandhi ji ko is prakaar kii durniti pasand nahin thi
 The methodology of his movement was very different in South Africa, his philosophy was completely different, so he felt the need for a new word for his war strategy

 The term "satyagraha" resembled the process of civil disobedience of the American philosopher Thoreau, who described the technique
 "satyagrah' kaa mul arth he satya ke prati aagrah satya ko pakade rahanaa or iske saath ahimsha ko maananaa 
 The main symptom of Satyagraha is not to be hostile to the unjust while outrightly opposing injustice
 hamen satya kaa paalan karte hue nirbhayatapurvak mrity kaa varan karnaa chahie or marate marate bhi jiske viruddh satyagrah kar rahe hai, uske prati vairabhav yaa krodh nahin karnaa chahie
 ' "satyagrah' main apane virdohi ke prati hinsa ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 He was a non-believer
 dhairya evam sahanubhuti se virdohi ko uski galati se mukt karnaa chahie, kyonki jo ek ko satya prathit hota he, vahiin duusare ko galat dikhaai de saktaa he
 Patience refers to suffering
 isliye is siddhant kaa arth ho gaya, "virdohi ko ksht athwa pidaa dekar nahin, balki swayan ksht uthaakar satya kaa rakshan
 ' mahatma gandhi ne kaha tha ki satyagrah main ek pad "prem' adhyahat he
 Satyagraha is a middle-aged compound
 satyagrah yani satya ke liye prem dwaara aagrah 
 Gandhiji gave a brief explanation of Satyagraha in front of Lord Inter as follows: "it is a movement which is completely based on truth and is being carried out in lieu of measures of violence
" ' ahimsa satyagrah darshan kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv he, kyonki satya tak pahunchne or un par tike rahane kaa ekmaatr upaay ahimsa hi he
 And in Gandhiji's words, "ahimsa is not a negative attitude of not hurting anyone, but it is a legislative attitude of active love
 ' There is talk of suffering in Satyagraha itself
 satya kaa paalan karte hue mrityu ke varan kii baat he
 "fasting" is the most powerful weapon in the priest's arsenal of truth and non-violence
 jise kisi rup main hinsa kaa aashray nahin letaa he, uske liye upwas anivaary he
 Tolerance till death and therefore fasting till death is also the last weapon of Satyagrahi
 ' parantu agar upwas dusron ko majaboor karne ke liye atmpeedan kaa rup grahan kare to vah tyajya he : acharya vinoba jise saumy, saumytar, saumyatam satyagrah kehete hai, us bhoomika main upwas kaa sthaan antim he
 "satyagraha" is not only a retribution, but also a unique life system, at the core of which the fasting of non-violence, truth, apragya, astheya, fearlessness, brahmacharya, sarvadharma samabhav, etc
 are fast
 jiskaa vyaktigat jivan in vraton ke kaaran shuddh nahin he, vah sachcha satyagrahi nahin ho saktaa
 That is why Vinoba calls these fasts "satyagraha loyalty"
 "satyagrah' or "ni:shastr pratikaar' main utana hi antar he, jitna uttari or dakshini dhruv main
 Disarmament retaliation is conceived as a weapon of weakness and does not prohibit the use of violence to accomplish its purpose, whereas satyagraha is conceived as the weapon of the ultimate knight and in any form Does not have space for the use of violence
 is prakaar satyagrah niskriy sthiti nahin he
 It is a state of strong activism
 satyagrah ahimsak pratikaar he, parantu vah niskriy nahin he
 The question of injustice and retaliation for injustice is eternal
 apni sabhyataa ke vikascram main manushya ne pratikaar ke liye pramukhat: chaar paddatiyon kaa avlamban kiya he- The first method is more evil than evil
 is paddati se dandniti kaa janm hua jab isse samaaj or raashtra kii samasyaon ke niraakaran kaa prayaas hua to yuddh kii sanstha kaa vikaas hua
 The second method is to give appropriate punishment for evil, ie crime for evil, not more
 yah amaryadit pratikaar ko simit karne kaa prayaas he
 The third method is good for evil
 yah buddha, isa, gandhi aadi santon kaa maarg he
 It involves the element of non-violence in lieu of violence
 chauthi paddati he buraai kii upeksha
 Acharya Vinoba says- "do not resist evil, but help the opponent's proper thinking
 uske sadvichaar main sahakaar karo
 Our goal should be fulfilled only in pure thinking, thinking, implementing it in personal life and in explaining it to others
 samnevaale ke samyak chintan main madad dena hi satyagrah kaa sahi swaroop he
 'this is what Vinoba Satyagraha calls a mild and gentle process
 satyagrah prem kii prakriya he
 He should be growing in order, more and more
 satyagrah kuch nayaa nahin he, kautumbik jivan kaa raajnneetik jivan main prasar maatr he
 Gandhiji's contribution is that he used the idea of satyagraha collectively in political life
 kaha jaataa he
 In a democracy, where all the work is going on through the "people's" opinion, through the representatives of the people, there is no place for Satyagraha
 vinoba kehete hai-vastav main samuhik satyagrah aavashyaktaa to us tantra' main nahin hogi, jisamen nirnay bahumat se nahin, sarvasammati se hoga
 But even in that case personal satyagraha can be done for the help of the neighbor in contemplation
 parantu loktantr main jab vichaarswatantry or vichaarpradhan ke liye puraa avasar he, to satyagrah ko kisi prakaar ke "dabaav, gheraav athwa band,' kaa rup nahin grahan karnaa chahie
 If this happens, the benignity of Satyagraha will be destroyed
 satyagrahi apane dharm se chyut ho jayega
 Today, the use of satyagraha and non-violent retaliation is going on continuously in different corners of the world
 dwitiya mahayuddh main hajaaron yudhvirohi paisefigt' sena main bharti hone ke bajaay jelon main gaye hai
 Philosophers such as Butrand Russell were locked behind prison doctrines due to anti-war satyagrahas
 anuastron ke kaarkaane aalder mastan se landan tak, prativarsh 60 mile kii padayatra kar hajaaron shantivaadee anushastron ke prati apana virodh prakat karte hai
 The story of the sacrifice of Negro leader Martin Luther King has become the immortal saga of the Satyagraha struggle
 italy ke danillo dolchi ke satyagrah kii kahani kisko romanchit nahin kar jaati
 All these efforts may not meet the test of Satyagraha, but these are definitely a step towards peace and non-violence
 satyagrah kaa rup antarrashtriya sangharsh main kaisaa hoga, iske vishay main acharya vinoba kehete hai-maan lijie, akramanakari hamaare gaanv main ghus jaataa he, to main kahoonga ki tum prem se aao-unase milane ham jaayenge, darenge nahin
 But if they want to do something wrong, then we will say to them, we cannot accept this thing - even if you finish us
 satyagrah ke is rup kaa prayog abhi antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye nahin hua he
 But if the power of non-violence is to be distinguished by overthrowing the power of violence, in order to protect human culture from the catastrophe of atomic age, there is no other path of retaliation other than this path of satyagraha
 is anuyug main shastr kaa pratikaar shastr se nahin ho saktaa
 But today's era has been told from where it is, it is not a blissful task at all
 america main essa kaha jaataa he kii "agar tumhe koi ek thappad mare to usase suuli pe chadha do " bhala ye bhi koi baat he ye to sara sar hinsha ko badhaava he or hamaare gadhiji kaha karte the kii "agar koi ek thappad mare to doosraa gaal de do ve khud sarama jaye ga" tamater adarsh aham : jis prakaar kaa vyakti ham bananaa chahenge

 There has been an attempt to explain crime since ages
 atev ke

 It is therefore difficult to explain
 purvi tathaa pashchimi deshon ke praarambhik vidhaanon ke naitik, dharmik tathaa saamaajik niyamon kaa todna samaan rup se aparaadh tha
 Sargent Santiphan has written that it is a crime to act contrary to what the majority of the community thinks is right
 bladeston kehete hai ki samue samudaay ke prati kartavya he tathaa uske jo adhikaar hai unki avagya aparaadh kaa nirnay nagar kii samoochee janata karti thi
 In today's law, crime is considered the object of 'public harm'
 do sau varsh purv tak sansar ke sabhi deshon kii yah nishcitt niti thi ki jisane samaaj ke adeshon kii avagya kii he, usase badla lenaa chahie
 That is why the criminal was tortured a lot
 jelon main uske saath pashu se bhi bura vyavhaar hota tha
 This feeling has changed now
 aaj samaaj kii nishchit dharna he ki aparaadh, shaareerik tathaa maansik donon prakaar kaa rog he, isliye apradhi kii chikitsa kerani chahie
 It has to be returned by making a decent, civilized, moral citizen while returning to society
 atev karagaar yatnaa ke liye nahin, sudhaar ke liye he
 It became clear that if crime is the name of defiance of moral and social orders, then the word cannot be given any definite meaning

 sanyukt rashtrasang ne bhi aparaagh kii vyakhya karne kii cheshtaa kii he or usne bhi keval 'asaamaajik' athwa 'samajavirohi' kaaryon ko aparaadh sweekaar kiya he
 But this cannot create a worldwide moral and crime related legislation

 Dr
 Lambrozo of Italy was the first scribe who tried to identify the 'criminal' rather than the crime
 pheri samaajavigyaan dwaara aparaadh ho, chaahe koi bhi kare, kisi bhi paristhiti main kare, uskaa or koi kaaran nahin, keval yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vyaktigat swatantra ichha se kiya gaya he yaa prakritik yaa swaabhaavik kaarnon kaa parinnam he
 Garofalo considered crime a matter of psychology: according to him, there are four types of criminals - murderers, violent criminals, criminals against property, and criminals of lust
 garophalo ke mat se prandand, aajanm karagaar yaa deshnikala, ye hi teen sajaayen honi chahie
 Fon Haamel raised the discussion of criminal reform for the first time

 According to him, man is just a set of his consciousness and conscience
 uske kaaryon se jise dukh pahunche yani jiske prati aparaadh kiya jaay usko bhi samaan rup se saamaajik ekta ke prati sachet karnaa chahie
 France's state revolution declared 'human rights'
 apradhi bhi manushya hai
 He too has some natural rights
 isliye apradhi aparaadh kii vyakhya chaahate he
 The most obvious interpretation of this was given by the French Penal Code of 1934
 aparaadh vahi he jise kanuunan manaa kiya gaya ho
 The thing which is denied in the then environment is the crime
 kintu, kanuunan nazaij kaam karnaa hi aparaadh nahin rah gaya he
 The point which Dr
 Gutner had raised has become a great subject for every court today
 vahi aparaagh he
 If while flying a kite on the roof, a stone comes down on the road from a boy's foot and falls on the head of another person, then that boy is not guilty of murder
 atev mahatv kii vastu niyat he
 Real justice can only be done by mixing the crime and its intention to commit it
 kintu samajashaastra ke panditonke saamne yah samasya bhi thi or he ki samaaj kii haani karanevaal ke saath vyavhaar kaisaa ho
 Aflatoon was of the opinion that it is unfair to harm the harm
 prasiddh samaaj-shastri jivik ne spasht kaha tha ki nyaay kabhi nahin chahta ki bhul karanevaal yani aparaadh karanwane ko pidaa pahunchaai jaae
 Lord Haldane also advised not to consider crime, but to consider the criminal, his problems, his environment
 britain ke prasiddh raajnneetijna tathaa kai baar praghan mantri bananevaale winston churchill kaa kathan he ki aparaadh tathaa apradhi ke prati janata kii kisi bhaavana tathaa drushti he, usee se us desh kii sabhyataa kaa vaastavik anumaan lag saktaa he
 British law considers the same act to be a crime that is done ill-favorably, voluntarily, cunningly, done, allowed or allowed
 bahut se aparaadh aise hote hai jo aparaadh hone ke karan hi aparaadh nahin samajhe jate
 For example, gene type marriages are illegal in the UK, so even if married, it would not be considered a marriage, such as marrying a girl under 16, etc
 naveen audyogic sabhyataa main aparaadh kaa rup tathaa prakaar bhi badal gaya he
 New types of crimes have started happening which are difficult to imagine
 isliye aparaadh kii pahchaan ab is samay yahi he ki kanoon ne jis kaam ko manaa kiya he, vah aparaadh he
 The one who has done the forbidden work is the culprit
 kintu, apradhi paristhiti kaa das ho saktaa he, vivash ho saktaa he, isliye use pahchaanane kaa praytn karnaa hoga
 Today's criminology does not believe that someone has become a worshiper by learning from the stomach or someone is deliberately making it his 'life'
 har ek aparaadh kaa tathaa har ek apradhi kaa adhyayan hona chahie
 That is why every crime and every criminal has become the subject of personal study, personal diagnosis and personal medicine
 manovigyaan aparaadh ko manushya kii maansik ulajhanon kaa parinaam maanata he
 a person whose childhood does not pass in an atmosphere of love and encouragement, many types of mental glands of inferiority are formed in his mind
 in grathiyon main uski man main uski bahut si maansik shakti sanchit rahati he
 Dr
 Alfred Adler states that a person who has mental glands of inferiority in his mind inevitably commits many kinds of crimes
 yah aparaadh vah isliye karata he ki swayan ko vah duusare logon se adhik balavaan siddh kar sake
 The gland of inferiority remains in the mind in this person, he is always in a state of inner mental dissatisfaction
 vah sab samay aise kaamon main apane ko lagaae rahata he jisase sabhi log uski ore dekhen or uski prashansa kare
 The mental gland of inferiority puts man in such works, due to which the human being has to hear many kinds of condemnation
 es vyakti swayan ko sadaa charchaa kaa vishay banaae rakhana chahta he
 If it is not discussed for good works then it should be for bad works
 uski maansik granthi use shant man nahin rahane detii
 She always inspires him to do special work
 yadi aise vyakti ko dand kiya jaae to isse uskaa sudhaar nahin hota, apitu isse uski maansik granthi or bhi jatil ho jaati he
 The treatment of such a criminal requires a mental doctor
 aadhunik manovigyaan ne hamen bataaya he ki samaaj main aparaadh ko kam karne ke liye dandvidhaan ko kadaa karnaa paryaapt nahin he
 For this education is required in the society
 jab manushya kii koi pravriti bachapan se hi prabal ho jaati he to aage chalkaar vah vishesh prakaar ke kaaryo main prakashit hoti he
 These works are beneficial for the society or are anti-social
 samajavirohi kaary hi hamen vyakti ke prati uchit drushtikon rakhana hoga
 The child who is kept dearly and is allowed to do all kinds of things, does not have the ability to relinquish his happiness for the happiness of others
 es vyakti kii saamaajik bhavanaayen aviksit rah jaati he
 Life does not create goodness
 iske kaaran vah na to samaajik drushti se bhale bure kaa vichaar kar saktaa he ore na bure kaamon se swayan ko rokane kii kshamta praapt kar paata he
 The parents of the child and the surrounding air conditioners and schools work in it
 uchit shiksha kaa ek uddeshy yahi he ki balak apane upar sanyam kii kshamta aa jaae
 The higher the state of self-control, the less the crime
 samaaj main bahut se log apane vivek se pratikul aparaadh karte hai
 What is the reason for this? According to the discoveries of modern psychology, the childhood of such people would not have passed properly
 ye log buddhi main to janm se hi praveen the atev ye anek prakaar ke vichaaron ko jaan sake
 But they did not have such permanent feelings in their mind in their childhood so that they can stop themselves from doing inappropriate work
 ye sthaayee bhav jab tak manushya ke swabhaav ke ang nahin ban jate tab tak ve manushya ko duraachaar se rokane kii kshamta nahin dete
 Such scholars commit crimes and even curse themselves for them
 isse ve apni maansik ulajhanein badha lete hai
 Sometimes they use their scholarship to prove the morality of their unfair actions
 inkaa sudhaar saamaanya dandvidhaan se nahin ho paata
 They devise many ways to avoid them
 aise logon ko sudhaarney ke liye aavashyak he ki shiksha kaa dhyey aajeevika kamanaa athwa vyavahaarakushalata praapt kar lenaa na hokar maanav vyaktitv kaa sampurna vikaas arthath bauddhik or bhavatmak vikaas ho
 When a person starts to see his own interest in the interest of others and gets the ability to conduct according to this idea, then only he is a qualified citizen of the society
 aisa vyakti jab kuch karata he, vah samaaj ke hit ke liye hi hota he
 Crime is a type of social asymmetry
 yah vyaktigat maansik vishmata kaa parinaam he
 This type of asymmetry starts in childhood
 iske sudhaar ke liye prarambh main aadat daalani padati he ki vah dusron ke sukh main nij sukh kaa anubhav kare
 He should do such things which will benefit everyone and praise him
 hindu dharamshastron ke anusaar saamanyatya chalit dharamshastra ke niyam, saamaajik niyam or rajanium ke viruddh aacharan karnaa hi aparaadh hai
 The field of Hindu theology is very broad, under which the idea of violation of all kinds of rules, economic, political, social etc
 is available
 isi ke anusaar hindu dharamshastron main saamaanya rup se 32 prakaar ke aparaadh bataae gaye hai
 The number of them can also be more because the nature of these crimes also varies according to the variation of country, time and society
 isliye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vichaar vyakt karte dikhaai padate hai
 Hindu theology or memoir appears to express different views regarding crimes and their punishments
 hindu dharamshastra ke antargat aparaadh ke swaroop par vichaar karne ke liye manu, yajyavlky, parashar, naarad, brihaspati, katyayan aadi ko pramaan mana jaataa hai
 In considering the crime from a mental point of view, Lambrozo had said long ago that the body of a criminal has a special shape
 parantu us samay unke mat ko manyata nahin mili
 Recently some experiments were conducted on criminals which concluded that 60 percent of the criminals have abnormal body designs
 raktakoshika main rahanevaale 23 gunasutra yugmon main se aparaadhiyon kaa 21vaan gunasutra yugma asaamaanya paaya gaya
 In 1968, an argument was made in a court of Celadan against a man, the murderer of his four children, that my chromosome is super-primitive, that is, the sequence of chromosomes in my blood cells is 'XY', which caused my crime psychosis
 It is natural and i have murdered my children to abdicate responsibility in an abnormal mental state

 In 1969, Dr

 Water culture or hydroponics is a technique in which crops are grown only with water and nutrients without planting in the field
 ise 'jaleey krishi' bhi kehete hai
 This technique of growing plants is quite right for the environment

 Then put it in a tray and cover it with jute sacks

 They then divide it into five trays
 har do-teen ghante main pani daalana hota he
 There is a hole in the tray, the more water the plants need, the more water stops
 yah takanic mehnat bhi bachaati he kyonki kheton main kaam karne ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii jarurat padati he, jabaki is takanic main zyada mehnat kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 In such a situation, the cost of crops is low and farmers get good profits

 The first turning point, which influenced Arabic literature, is the Islamic Revolution
 is aadhaar par san 622 i
 se uske jivan kaa ek nayaa yug prarambh hua jab ishwar ke sandeshvahak makka chhodkar madina chale gaye
 Earlier era is called the era of 'jahalat' in the definition of Islam and the oldest capital available in Arabic literature today is from this era
 yah lagbhag samast poonji padyon ke rup main hi he jo paanch or adhiktar chhathi shatabdi isvi ke arabi kaviyon dwaara prastut kii gai he
 Since the written form of Arabic was not in vogue in those days, these verses remained preserved in the poets' lips for centuries and remained the traditional oral treasury of the dynasty
 tatpashchaat 8veen tathaa 9veen shatabdiyon main jab vidya tathaa kala kaa prarambh hua, inako vibhinn prakaar se pustakon main ekatrit kar liya gaya
 These poems are the earliest examples of Arabic literature
 phir bhi ye uski baalyavastha kii parichaayak nahin balki uski praudhata kii suchak hai, gambhir or swasth
 The scholars are amazed when they look at the poetry of that era, and they have to believe that their cleanliness and beauty would not have been achieved without centuries of practice and effort
 parantu yah sab hua kis prakaar, iskaa vaastavik gyaan abhi hamako nahin he
 Yet there is no doubt that Muhammad's poetry is mature
 at: prayek yug main uske saundarya, gunon tathaa visheshtaon ko sweekaar kiya gaya he or aaj bhi uskaa maan tathaa gaurav maanya hai
 The poem was in its youth in Arabia before the rise of Islam
 melon tathaa bazaaron main kavisammelan praaia: hua karte the
 Poets had great respect in society
 at: jab koi nayaa kavi prasiddh hota tha tab uske kabeeley kii striyaan ikatthi hokar utsav manaati or mangalageet gaati thim
 People from other tribes used to congratulate the tribes of that poet, because the poet was the protector of the great works of the clan and the inspector of his dignity
 yahi kaaran he ki praaia: kavi hi kabeeley kaa adhyaksh hua karata tha
 Pact and war and fame and taint were in the hands of the poet
 uski ospurn kavitaayen murajhaae hridayon main utsaah bhar detii thim or madhur geet aveshpurna mastishkon ko santvanaa dete the
 The fame of the person he praised increased and the person who did evil, he could not find any place to hide
 kavita kaa pradhan evam prachlit rup qasida tha
 In this area, poets performed their skills
 iskaa aarambh praaia: is prakaar hota he maano kavi kisi yatra main kuch puraane bhagnavsheshon ke saamne khadaa he jahaan usne pehle kabhi nivas kiya tha
 This method is genuine and expedient for Arab poets because the Arabs were always on the move in search of pastures like nomads
 kuch dinon tak ek sthaan par nivas kar chukne ke baad ve vahaan se kooch kar dete the
 In this temporary period of time, innumerable incidents of friendship and enmity occurred in different tribes
 at: jab kabhi duusari baar us jagah se hokar ve guzarate the tab purvasmritiyon kaa simhavlokan swaabhaavik ho jaataa tha
 Therefore, on seeing those destroyers, pictures of past events would come in front of the poet's eyes and he used to automatically narrate the events of his love and the stages of disconnection
 is sambandh main vah apni premika ke saundarya tathaa swabhaav sambandhi visheshtaon kaa manohar chitra upasthit karata tha
 Then it was as if he resumed his journey and got absorbed in the description of sandy hills, dunes and other natural scenes
 usee samay vah apane ghode yaa apni oontni kii chaal, dealdol tathaa sahansheeltaa kii vishuddh prashansa karata tha
 His ostrich was likened to a wild bull or other animal and used to describe his travels and excursions and war and killings
 uske baad apane or kabeeley ke mahan kaaryon or ucchadarsho kaa varnan bade gaurav ke saath karata tha
 After that, if there was a specific objective before him, he would also describe it
 is prakaar qasida ke yahi ang hote hai jinamein paraspar koi gaharaa lagaav or drudh sambandh nahin hota
 It is similar to the necklace of various types of small and large beads in which some pearls can be pulled out easily and threaded into other necklaces
 yah yug kii kavita kii pramukh visheshta yah he ki vah vaastaviktaa ke bahut nikat he
 What the poets have described is their actual experience and observation
 isiilie is sambandh main yah kinvadanti he ki 'al-sher deevanul arab' arthath kavita arab kaa bhandar he
 This poem appears to have contributed significantly to the making of the ancient history of Arabia

 One of the major reasons for his neglect of poetry was that all the things that had been particularly motivating him till now - such as ethnic prejudice, tribal pride, accusations and hatred, arrogance, marketing, drinking, gambling etc
 were all given to him by Islam
 Was declared prohibited

 The Priyetk Dal used the weapon of poetry and made poets the means of their own will

 But its general style was almost the same as that of the poems of the era of Jahalat
 itnaa avashya he ki bhashaa evam varnan main kuch mithaas or shishtataa kii jhalak dikhaai jaati he
 Every poet of this period was a supporter of some party, in whose praise he devoted his entire poetry
 saath hi virodhiyon par doshaaropan karne main bhi vah koi kasar nahin rakhata tha
 Therefore, most of the poems of this period are based on praise and accusation

 a peculiarity of this era is the mutual poetry of Farzadq and Zarir, which was so famous that even the soldiers in the battlefield used to debate about the poetry of these days
 duusari ore arab main vishesh rup se gajaalia shaayari kaa prachlan tha jisamen umr-bin-abi rabia kaa naam bahut prasiddh he
 Some lover poets are also very famous; Such as Jamil, who was Bussaina's lover and Majnu who was Laila's lover
 inako kavitaayen saundarya tathaa prem kii samvednaaon evam ghatnaon or sanyog-viyog ke anubhavon tathaa avasthaaon se paripurna hai or unamem sanvaden, prabhaav, saundarya, madhurata, manoharita evam manoranjaktaa bhi paryaapt maatra main uplabdh he
 This period is entitled from every point of view to be called the Golden Age
 isamen har prakaar kii unnati apni charam seemaa ko pahunch gai thi
 From the Khalifa to the general public, all were engaged in upliftment of education and art skills
 baghdaad rajdhani ke atirikt vistrut islamic rajya main asankhya shikshacendre sthapit the jo vidya tathaa kalakaushal kii unnati ke liye ek duusare se aage bad jane kii hode kar rahe the
 As a result of this conducive environment, the garden of poetry also started to swoon
 sabhyataa tathaa samskruti kii unnati or anya jatiyon tathaa bhashaaon ke mail se naveen vichaardhaaraen or nae shabd evam vaakyansh kavita main sthaan paane lage
 There was seriousness and subtlety in thoughts and flow and melody in words
 vibhinn varnanshaliyaan nikaali gayi or prashansa evam doshaaropan ke vibhinn dhang nikaale gaye jinamein atishyokti ko charam seemaa tak pahunchaa diya gaya
 Among the warriors of the region were Abu Tammam, Bahuri and Mutanabi
 iske atirikt purvasimaaon tathaa pratibandhon ko todakar kavitakshetra ko or bhi vistrut kiya gaya tathaa usamen vibhinn raahen nikaali gayi
 On the one hand, the incidents of love and attachment and the narratives of the works were dissuaded
 is disha kaa pratinidhi kavi abunuvaas tha
 On the other hand streams of divination, purity and preaching flowed
 is kshetra main abul atahiya sarvapratham tha
 Similarly, Abul Ala Alamarrow philosophically shed light on the various organs of humanity and Ibrul Fariz flew into the atmosphere of spirituality
 yahan spain kii arabi kavita kaa varnan bhi vishesh rup se abhisht he
 The Muslims ruled there for about 800 years
 is bich vidya tathaa kalakaushal ne vahaan aisi unnati kii ki use dekhakar europe shatabdiyon tak aashcharyachakit rahaa
 The Arabic poetry here also initially followed the style of the pre-muhammadan poetry, but soon the local climate attained beauty
 isaki do visheshtaayen hai: ek to prakritik drishyon kaa chittkarshak varnan; duusari prembhaavanaaon kii manoharini kahani
 Apart from this, there is a special thing here that a new type of poetry in the lingua franca has attained maturity and defeated everyone
 spain kaa kan-kan uske raagon se dravit ho gaya
 Among the famous poets there, Ibre Hani and Ibre Jadoon are particularly notable
 is kaal main arabi gadhy ne bhi bahut unnati kii
 Initially, Ibrul Muqaffa translated some books of other languages into Arabic of which Kalolah and Dimna are very famous
 phir pracheen katha kahaniyon ko badi shighrata ke saath pustakon main sankalit kiya jane laga
 On the one hand, writing power was used on narrative stories and entertaining knowledge was presented in a captivating style
 is sambandh main alifalaila kaa naam bahut prasiddh he jo vibhinn prakaar kii sainkadon kahaniyon kaa sangrah he
 On the other hand, the introduction of caliphs, great men, poets, litterateurs and scholars, descriptions of virtue, etiquette, legends, art skills etc
 were collected
 is kshetra ke mir prasiddh mahanubhav jaahiz the
 After them Ibra Kutaybah, Ibre Abde Rabbi and Abul Faraj Asfhani are more famous among the active participants in this field
 inaki pustakon ko arabi sahitya main bahut unchaa sthaan praapt he
 In the literary writings of this period, rhyming prose also gained more fame and its importance increased so much that it was considered an essential part of high-quality prose
 ant main isaki unnati maqaamaat ke rup main apni charam seemaa par pahaunchi ore vaastaviktaa yah he ki bahuterey sahityamrmagyon kii raay main isse adhik ucch str kaa sahitya ab tak astitv main nahin aayaa tha
 The center of the maqamat is the clown hero and his style is dramatic
 prayek maqamah saahitiyik sangrah hota he jisamen nayak apane gyaan sambandhi varnanon tathaa saahitiyik haas-parihaas or yogyata ke dwaara apane samast pratidwandviyon ko purnroopen haraakar sab darshakon ko aashcharya main daal detaa he
 There is nothing in it, but only the miracle of literary exaggeration and narrative style
 badiujjamaan hamadani or baad hariri arabi sahitya ke is kaal ke akaash main chandra-surya kii bhaanti chamakate hai
 In addition, thousands of such scholars worked in the fields of innumerable disciplines and arts, such as Tafsir Hadith, Qikah, History, Nirukta, Mantik, Philosophy, Astrology, Bhumiti, Mathematics etc
 inaki asankhya kritiyon main gyaan kaa bahumoolya sangrah ekatra he or inamen se saikadon pustakon kii gananaa ucch koti kii gyaan sambandhi tathaa saahitiyik kritiyon main hoti he
 To this day, scholars have been taking advantage of this and dipping in their sea and extracting precious pearls
 phir bhi, unke bhandar kaa bahut bada bhaag abhi tak agyaat or sansar kii drushti se ojhal he jo vidya evam kala ke jigyaasuon ko khoj or nirantar parishram ke liye aamantrit karata he
 The kingdom of Baghdad was decimated from the Abbasid period
 ab is yug main uske tukade tukade ho gaye
 Sovereignty was divided among the Mughals, Turks and other castes
 raajnneetik kanti kaa prabhaav gyanajagat par bhi padana anivaary tha
 Therefore, there was no progress in knowledge and literature in this long time
 kavita to vastav main bilkul nishpraan ho chuki thi
 Poets were only absorbed in literal play
 moulikta kaa pataa nahin tha
 Ancient themes and ideas were being researched
 albusiri kii nihsandeh kavita main bahut prasiddhi hui jiskaa aadhaar vishesh rup se vah qasida he jo usne rasulullah ke sammaan main likhaa tha
 Apart from this, the name of Safiuddin Hilly is also very famous, which can be called the greatest poet of this period
 nihsandeh itihaas lekhan ne is kaal main uttarottar unnati kii
 In historical works of this period, a wide range of points of view and realism are found in sufficient quantity
 is sambandh main ibre khaldoon kaa naam sabase adhik prasiddh he jisane itihaslekhan main ek nai style kaa sutarapaat kiya
 He has very beautifully described many knowledge, political and social problems in his role of history and has presented a detailed philosophical view of history
 at: us bhoomika kaa mahatv swatantra pustak se bhi adhik he
 Later European historians Machiavelli, Vico and Gibbon, etc
 are in fact followers of Ibre Khaldun
 is kaal main kuch vidvan aise bhi hai jo anek vidyaon tathaa kalaon main samaan dakshata rakhte the
 Therefore, his personality cannot be limited in any one area
 ibre taimiyah, zahabi, ibrahajar asqalaani or jilaluddin suuti aise hi vidvan hai
 This mandala is shining like a firefly in the lightless sky of this period
 inaki sainkadon kritiyon main samast prakaar kii vidyaon or kalaon kaa kosh bharaa hua he
 Apart from these, Ibre has become a great scholar and explorer of approved grammar, nirukta and literature
 'nisanul arab' uski vishaal kriti he jisaki gananaa shabdkosh tathaa sahitya kii chotii kii pustakon main hoti he
 It is a renaissance period of Arabic literature that begins with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt
 is kaal main kuch aise kaaran or paristhitiyaan utpann huin ki arabi sahitya main jivan kii ek nai lahar daudi or usamen nai-nai shakhaayen foot nikaleen
 Western culture and civilization, knowledge and literature and ideology and outlook greatly influenced the Arab country
 aadhunik dhang ke vidyalayon kaa shriganesh hua, mudrankala kaa avishkaar tathaa patrikaon evam samachaarpatron kaa prachaar hua
 Literary institutions related to knowledge were established
 is prakaar arab jati naveen pravritiyon ore drushtikonon se parichit hui
 Feelings of freedom, patriotism and nationalism awakened
 raajnneetik evam saamaajik vichaardhaaraon main bhi parivartan hua
 As a result, a revolution in Arabic literature was born
 kavita ne karavat badali
 The signs of life began to be visible in it
 shabdic chamatkaar ke sthaan par ab varnya-vishay kii ore adhik dhyaan diya jane laga
 Political poems and national anthems were written
 anya bhashaaon kii kavitaaon ke arabi main padyanuwaad kiye gaye
 Hence, the poems of proud poet Allama Iqbal of Urdu were also translated
 iske atirikt kavita ke maapdand bhi badal gaye
 Some poets also wrote freelance poems and concrete poems were composed on one subject each against the ancient style
 is kaal ke vishisht kaviyon ke naam ye hai: al barudi, hafiz ibrahim, shaukee, rusaafi, khalil matraan, abushadi, abdurrahman sidki, abdurrahman badavi or suleman al isa ityadi
 In the modern era, more emphasis was placed on prose than on poetry, and that other parts of literature were promoted in it
 marun nakkaash ne arabi sahitya main naatak kaa shriganesh kiya
 After some time, Abdullah Nadeem and Najib al-haddad paid attention to this
 phir sheeghra hi natakkala ne itani adhik unnati kii ki aajkal uski gananaa ucch sahitya ke ek mahatvapurn ang ke rup main hoti he
 Similarly, novels and short stories were also recognized
 pehle europe kii bhashaaon se har prakaar kii aitihaasik, saamaajik, prem sambandhi tathaa hasya ras kii kathaayen arabi main roopantarit kii gai
 Subsequently, the original compositions of this subject also started coming into the literary field from which the work of making ancient Arabic civilization alive and awakening national sentiments was taken
 is kshetra ke vishisht vyakti ye hai-abdulqadir maazini, mohammadahusain haikal, mahmud taimur, toufik-al-hakim, mohammad farid, abu hadeed, ehsaan abdul ore azeej abaazh
 The name of Al Manfalooti is very famous among high-ranking writers
 vah ek vishisht style kaa ekmaatr adhishthata he
 The beautiful depiction of the disorganized conditions of society and the unpleasant bitter experiences of life is part of that
 khalil jibran ne bhi sundar sahitya kaa ucchadarsh prastut kiya he
 The greatest author of this period is undoubtedly Mustafa Sadiq whose book Bahulukalam is a very important work
 aadhunik kaal main itihaas or samalochna kii ore bhi vishesh rup se dhyaan diya gaya
 The work of examining ancient knowledge and literary capital in the light of current theories is being done at a rapid pace
 doctor taha husain, al-jaiyaad or al-akkad ityadi atyant ucch koti ke sahityakar, vichaarak or aalochak hai
 These people presented beautiful works in imitation of Islamic civilization, history of literature, and current style related to knowledge and other parts of literature
 vartmaan kaal ke sahityakaron ore aalochakon main do drushtikon pratyaksh rup se milte hai
 Some are in favor of the ancient style
 ve pashchim kii samast gyaan sambandhi evam saahitiyik dhanrashi or aadhunik pravritiyon evam drushtikonon se puraa-puraa laabh uthaane ke saath-saath apane pracheen siddhanton, jaateey paramparaon tathaa maanamaryada ko bhi sthir rakhana chaahate hai or iske vipareet kuch arabi sahitya ko bilkul pashchimi vichaardhaara or varnanstyli main dhaal dena chaahate hai
 They are not ready to accept any ancient thing until it meets the criteria of the current ideology

 computing yani sanganan main feed agrigater, jise feed reader, news reader yaa saadharantah agrigater kaha jaataa he ek desktop yaa web anuprayog hota he jo ki internet par muhaiyaa syndicated masaude, masalan samachar surkhiyaan, blog, podcast or vlog kaa sankalan kar ek hi sthaan par use pradarshit karata he
 As this content keeps on changing or updating, the compiler has to constantly monitor the draft feed
 is lekh main agrigater ke liye sankalak shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, par dhyaan rahe ki yah maanak shabd nahin he
 The syndicated draft that the compiler accepts is usually provided in RSS or any other formatted format such as RDF or Atom
 sankalak jaalasthalon yani websits par nai saamagree jode jane kaa pataa lagane main vyay hone vaale samay va shram kii bachat karata he or ek tarah se pathak ke liye uskaa vyaktigat akhbaar bana kar use pesh karata he
 Once a feed has been subscribed or become a regular reader, the compiler locates the new content at fixed intervals according to the user's wish and delivers the content to it
 is takanic ko pul taknalaji kaha jaataa he
 This is the exact opposite of push technology used in tools such as email or instant messaging
 saath hi push takanic se saamagree ke graahakon kii tulana main sankalak badi saralata se kisi bhi feed se anasbsakraib kar saktaa he yani uskaa pathak banane se inkaar kar saktaa he
 Most compilers also allow the user to export and import a list of feeds read by his or other readers in OPML format
 kai portal jaalasthalon main sankalan kii suvidha jalsthal par hi muhaiyaa he, masalan maai yahuu yaa ai google par
 This feature is also available on modern web browsers and email programs
 sankalak masaude ko samahit kar kisi ek hi brouzar yaa desktop anuprayog par pesh kar detaa he
 These applications are also called RSS readers, feed readers, feed aggregators, news readers or search aggregators
 jin sankalkon main podcasting kii kabaliyat he ve swatah media filein jaise kii empi3 ricarding kaa adhibharan yaa downlod bhi kar saktaa he
 In some cases, it can also load these files directly into portable media players such as ipods connected to computers
 haal hi main kuch naye sankalak, jinhen "aresas narator" pukaara ja rahaa he, bhi maidan main utre hai jo na keval feed masaude kaa sankalan karte hai balki unhen aflin yani internet se jude bagaiyr audio ricarding ke rup main sunne kii suvidha dete hai
 Web-based compilers are applications that are located on remote servers and are used on a network of applications such as Google Reader or bloglines
 chunki ye anuprayog internet ke madhyam se prayukt hote hai atah prayokta apni sabsakribd feed ko jahaan bhi internet sampark uplabdh ho vahaan pard saktaa he
 Modern compilers use technologies like Agax and are also available as multiple widgets
 vyaktigat sankalkon ke alaava saamudayik sankalak bhi hote hai jo saamanytah kisi laghu samudaay ke feed kaa sankalan karte hai
 For example, see the page of the list of compilers at the end of the article
 clyant yaa desktop anuprayog kaa zyaadaatar computer par baqayda sthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Their graphical user interface is similar to most popular email clients such as Outlook, with a draft showing in most three panels, a list of subscribed feeds on the left, which can be grouped into groups, folders, or squares, and a draft entry in the right panel
 kai anuprayogon main tikar tepe yaa news tikar yaa alert ke rup main nai pravishtiyon ke bare main jaankaree hasil kii ja sakati he
 Many programming languages provide libraries that application builders or website owners can read feeds using or display or use in different formats

 Media compilers, also known as podcatchers due to the popularity of podcasts, are compilers of feeds in which the draft is primarily audio or video
 feed main ye ke rup main daale jate hai
 These can be mesh or desktop based applications
 ye media ko downlod kar use chalaa sakate hai yaa ypod jaise kisi bahari media player ke saath sikronies bhi kar sakate hai
 Content redundancy is a fundamental problem with compilers, especially if the user is a reader of multiple feeds
 sankalak alag alag taur par is samasya se nibatate hai
 In addition to facilitating the categorization of feeds to the user, they take advantage of the tags and keywords attached to the entries
 iske alaava tarika he prayokta ke atension profile kaa prayog kar uski ruchi ke mutabik chanti hui saamagree hi pesh karnaa

 a computer file is a class of information collected, or a resource for storing information that is available to a computer program, and is usually based on some kind of durable computer storage
 sanchika tikaoo is lihaaz se hoti he ki yah maujuuda kaarykram ke samaapt hone ke baad bhi anya kaaryakramon dwaara istemaal ke liye maujuud rahati he
 Computer files can traditionally be considered the modern form of paper documents contained in files from offices and libraries, which is why the file is named in English
 nunatam str par kai aadhunik prachaalan pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko keval ek-aiami biton kii shrunkhlaa hi maanati hai
 At a more high level, when the contents of the file are also kept in view, these binomial digits may be considered representing integers, letters, image pixels, sounds, or anything else
 yah sanchika kaa istemaal karne vaale kaarykram par nirbhar he ki vah kis prakaar sanchika kaa arth nikaalata he or jaankaree ke aantarik jamaav ko kaise samajhataa he, taaki prayokta ko or adhik myne rakhane vaali style main isi jaankaree ko prastut kar sake 
 At any given time, the file will have a shape, usually expressed in bytes, and indicate how much space the file has in store
 adhiktar aadhunik prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah aakaar koi bhi arunatmak purnank ho saktaa he, lekin pranali ke anusaar isaki adhiktam seemaa hogi
 But the simple definition of a file does not preclude that its current size has any real meaning, except in the case when the contents of the file are some of the contents within a set of persistent collections
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi unics-samaan pranali main jis sanchika kii ore / bin / ls kii kadi ingit karti he, uskaa aakaar paribhaashit hota he or virale hi badalata he
 Compare this to / dev / null, it is also a file but its size always changes but probably does not matter the same way as in the previous example
 kisi sanganak sanchika main maujuud jaankaree or choti jaankariyon ke pulindon ke rup main ho sakati he yaa chalneey bhi ho sakati he
 It only depends on the creator of the file how the information will be organized in it
 is kaaran se anekon kam maanak vaali sanchika dhaanche maujuud hai jo saralatam se jatiltam tak har prakaar ke makasad ke liye kaam aa sakate hai
 Most computer files are used by computer programs
 ye kaarykram apane istemaal ke liye yathochit sanchikaaye banaate, badalte va mitaate hai
 The program-makers who make these programs decide which files are needed, how they are to be used and their names
 kuch maamalon main sanganak kaarykram sanchikaon main her fer is dhang se karte hai ki ve sanganak prayokta ko dikhti hai
 For example, in the word-processing program, users make changes to document files and the user names them by themselves
 dastauez sanchika kii saamagree is tarah yojit hoti he ki shabd-sansaadhan kaarykram ko vah samaj main aa jaae, lekin prayokta hi uskaa naam va bhandaaran pataa nirdhaarit karata he or bhandaaran kii pramukh jaankaree bhi prayokta hi nirdhaarit karata he
 Many applications push all the content files into a single file and mark them inside to keep track of different types of information
 duum or quek jaise khelon kii saamagree sanchikaaye iskaa ek udhaaharan hai
 On the computer, it is possible to create, modify, extend, shrink, move, and delete files
 adhiktar maamalon main, sanganak kaaryakramon ko sanganak par chalaa kar yah sab kiya jaataa he, par zarurat ho to sanganak kaa prayokta bhi sanchikaon main badlaav kar saktaa he
 For example, Microsoft Word files are usually created by the Microsoft Word program based on user instructions, but the user can also delete, delete, or transfer these files directly through a file manager program such as Windows Explorer
 unics-jaisi pranaaliyon main prayokta-kshetra kii prakriyaayein aamtaur par sidhe sanchikaon se nahin ulajhati hai; prachaalan pranali ek pruthakkaran str pradaan karti he jisaki vajah se prayokta-kshetra kii ore se sanchikaon ke saath kaa lagbhag sara len-dein kathor kadiyon se hota he
 a file can be named by using rigid links; Purely operating systems do not have names of files
 udhaaharan ke liye prayokta-kshetra ke kaarykram kisi sanchika ko mitaa nahin sakate hai, ve keval us sanchika kii kadi ko mitaa sakate hai or yadi ashthi ko yah pataa lagata he ki is sanchika kii ab koi or kadiyaan nahin hai, to vah is sanchika ko mitaa saktaa he
 In fact, only the layer transacts through files, but user-zone requests are done through files in such a way that it remains unknown to user-zone programs
 yun to kaaryakramon kaa sanchikaon ke saath kaa len-dein prachaalan pranali or sanchika pranali ke hisaab se alag alag hota he par mukhyatah yah gatividhiyaan aam hai: In modern computer systems, filenames are commonly used to access files
 kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah naam sanchika se judaa hota he
 In some others, the file itself is anonymous, but named links point to it
 is maamle main prayokta kadi ko hi sanchika kaa naam samaj saktaa he, lekin yah vastav main sahi nahin hoga, khaastaur par jab ek hi sanchika kii ek se adhik kadiyaan hon tab
 The files can be in directories
 lekin behatar yah kahana hoga ki nirdeshika ke andar sanchikaon kii suchi yaa sanchikaon kii kadiyon kii suchi ho sakati he
 Under this definition it is very important to understand that the term "file" also includes directories
 isse nirdeshikaon ke sopan sambhav hote hai, arthath nirdeshikaon ke andar upanirdeshikas
 The name that refers to a file inside a directory must be unique
 lekin kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main naam ke saath prakaar bhi nirdisht hota he jisaki vajah se ek nirdeshika main do alag alag prakaar kii sanchikaayen ek hi naam se sambhav hai jaise ki ek hi naam kii ek nirdeshika va ek sanchika
 In environments in which files are named, the pair of file names and paths must be unique - the names and paths of any two files cannot match the names and paths of any other file
 jahaan sanchika benaam ho, namit sandarbh ek namasthaan ke antargat rahenge
 Most times a name in any namespace will refer to exactly one or zero files
 lekin, koi bhi sanchika kisi namasthaan main shunya, ek yaa adhik naamon se sanderbhit kii ja sakati he
 Depending on the context of the application, the appropriate name for any file or link must be made up of special characters
 sanganak pranali par nirbhar karata he ki yah naam upyukt he yaa nahin
 Early computers allowed a limited number of letters and numbers in a file's name, but modern computers allow long names to contain Unicode characters or Unicode numbers in almost any order, so that the purpose of the file is understood at a glance
 
 kuch sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon main khaali sthaan kii anumati dete hai, kuch nahin
 The ephemeral sensitivity of file names is determined by the file system
 unics sanchika pranaliyaan aamtaur par laghudirghasanvedi hoti hai or prayokta-stareey anuprayogon ko aisi sanchikaaye banane detii hai jinke aksharon main keval laghu or deergh kaa fark ho
 Microsoft Windows offers several file systems, with different policies for short-term sensitivity
 yadi prayokta nirdeshika pravishtion main sanchika naamon ko badalane ke liye discs sampadak kaa istemaal kare to prachlit effeti pranali main kai sanchikaaye ho sakati hai jinke naam main keval deergh-laghu aksharon kaa hi fark ho
 However, user applications generally do not allow this
 adhiktar sanganak, sanchikaon ko sopan ke aadhaar par yojit karte hai or iske liye folder, nirdeshika yaa kaitlog kaa istemaal karte hai
 Whatever the word, the idea is the same
 har folder main kuch sankhya main sanchikaaye ho sakati hai or unamem anya folder ho sakate hai
 These other folders are called subfolders
 inamen or sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai, aadi-aadi, aise kar ke ek vriksh-rupi dhaanchaa nirmit hota he jisamen ek "guru folder" yaa hota he jiske adheen kitne bhi str tak sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai
 Folders can also have names like files
 folderon ke jariye sanchikaon ko taarkik tareeke se yojit karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 Whenever a computer uses folders, each file and folder has not only its own name but also a path that indicates which folder or folders the file or folder is present in
 is path main ek vishesh chihn - jaise ki / - ko jariye sanchika yaa folder naamon ke bich main likhaa jaataa he
 For example in the example in this article, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers indicates that a file named Managers is in a folder called Salaries, and this folder is in Payroll
 sanchika or folder ke naamon ke bich main aage jhuki lakeer he, sarvocch yaa jad folder kaa koi naam nahin he, atah naam aage jhuki lakeer se shuru hota he 
 Many computer systems use extensions in file names, also called file types
 windos sanganakon main vistaar sanchika ke naam ke baad ek bindu or bindu ke aage kuch akshar kaa rup letaa he, ye akshar sanchika ke prakaar kii pahchaan hote hai
 The 
txt extension is the identity of the text file, the 
doc extension is the identity of a document, especially in Microsoft Word file format; Etc
 etc
 sanganak pranali par vistaaron kaa istemaal hone par bhi, sanganak pranali unhen kis had tak pahachaanata he or kis had tak unke anusaar vyavhaar karata he, isamen bhi kaafii vividhta he, kuch pranaaliyon main ye anivaary hai, jabaki kuch or main inke maujuud hone se bhi koi fark nahin padataa, ye nazarandaz kar die jate hai
 Many modern computer systems provide ways to prevent files from getting damaged
 jo sanganak ek se adhik prayoktaaon kii suvidha dete hai ve sanchika anumatiyaan bhi lagu karte hai jinase yah niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sanchikaaye va folder bana, mitaa yaa badal saktaa he or koun nahin
 For example, a user may have permission to change a file but not delete it, or to create files and folders but not delete it
 anumatiyon ke jariye yah bhi nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he ki keval kuch hi prayokta kisi sanchika yaa folder kii saamagree dekh saken
 Permissions protect against illegal alteration or destruction of content in files and illegal users can be prevented from viewing certain files to keep private information confidential
 kai sanganakon main ek or bachaav vidhi maujuud hoti he jise "keval pathneey chihn" kehete hai
 When this sign is placed, files can be inspected but cannot be changed
 yah chihn vikat jaankaree ke liye laabhadaayak hota he jise badla yaa mitaayaa nahin janaa chahie, jaise ki sanganak pranali ke aantarik purzon dwaara prayukt kuch vishesh sanchikaon ke liye
 Some systems also include a "hidden sign", which ensures that the file becomes invisible
 is chihn ke jariye sanganak pranali aisi zaruri pranali sanchikaon ko chhipaati he, jinhen prayoktaaon dwaara badla nahin janaa chahie
 In the above discussion, the file is described as a concept for a high level operating system or user
 lekin, kisi bhi sanchika ko vastav main kaam laayak hone ke liye bhautik rup se upasthit hona aavashyak he
 That is, the abstract concept of a file needs to be in the actual physical form in the real computer system, otherwise it does not have to exist
 bhautik rup se adhiktar sanganak sanchikaaye kisi prakaar ke saamagree bhandaaran upkaran main rakhi jaati hai
 Examples are hard jisc, through which most operating systems operate
 adhiktar sanchikaaye inhen main rakhi jaati hai
 Hard disks are the most widely available non-volatile storage device in the early 21st century
 yadi sanchikaon main keval asthaayee saamagree hi ho to unhen areem main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In operating systems like Unix, many files are not directly connected to any physical storage device: / dev / null is a prime example of this, likewise almost all of the files contained within / dev, / proc and / sys are of the same type
 
 inkaa prayokta kshetra main sanchikaon kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 But these are virtual files that actually exist only as objects of the operating system's archetype
 sanganak sanchikaon ko chumbakeey pattayon main bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases files can also be stored in other media such as writeable compact discs, digital multivariate disks, zip drives, USB flash drives, etc
 jab sanganak sanchikaon main bahut mahatvapurn jaankaree hote he to pratilipi prakriya ke jariye aisi sthitiyon ko parinaamon se bachane kii koshish kii jaati he jinamein sanchikaaye nasht ho sakati hai
 Copying files simply means keeping the copies of the files in another location so that if something happens to the original computer or they are accidentally erased, they can be returned by copy
 sanchikaon kii prati rakhane ke kai tareeke hai
 Most computer systems provide convenience programs that facilitate the copying process, as it can take a lot of time if many files are to be copied
 sanchikaon ko aksar lekhanyogy sidi yaa cartrij tepon jaise hastantaraneey madhyamon main pratilipit kiya jaataa he
 Copying files to another hard disk of the same computer protects against a malfunction of one disk, but if the entire computer is to be protected against the risk of malfunction or loss, it is necessary to make copies of those files in such medium Which can be taken away from this computer and stored in a safe place
 dada-baap-betaa pratilipi vidhi swachaalit rup se teen pratilipiyaan banaati he, sanchika kii sabase puraani prati dada sanchika hoti he or betaa maujuuda pratilipi
 The system of which files are organized, named, stored and changed by which computer is called its file system
 adhiktar prachaalan pranaaliyon main kam se kam ek sanchika pranali hoti he
 Multiple file systems can be run simultaneously in many operating systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, nae emes windos sanganakon par emes-dos ke puraane effeti-style kii sanchika pranaliyaan samarthit hai or saath hi taaze windos sanskarnon kii prachlit sanchika pranali antiatioes bhi chalati he
 Every system has its advantages and disadvantages
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak effeti main keval 8 akshar ke sanchika naam chalate hai, jabaki antiatioes main lambey sanchika naam sambhav hai jinamein khaali sthaan bhi ho sakate hai
 You can name a file in NTFS like Payroll records but in FAT this name can be something similar to payroll
dat
 sanchika prabandhak kaarykram suvidhadaayak kaarykram hote hai jinke jariye sanchikaon va folderon ko hilaayaa, banaaya, mitaayaa yaa punarnamit kiya ja saktaa he, par ye vastav main aapako sanchika kii saamagree ko padhane yaa saamagree jodne nahin dete hai
 Each computer system provides at least one file manager for its parent file system
 windos main sabase adhik prayukt sanchika prabandhak kaarykram windos explorer he or mike main yah finder he
 Linux has many file managers like Nautilus, Conqueror
 sanchika ke liye prayukt angrezi shabd "fil" kaa sanganak bhandaaran ke sandarbh main prayog 1952 se hi chhidi pattiyon main sanchit jaankaree ke liye shuru ho gaya tha
 In the initial experiment, people used to call the underlying software only file
 udhaaharan ke liye ibiem 350 kii discs drivon ko "discs fil" kaha jaataa tha
 Systems such as the 1962 compatible time sharing system had file systems that displayed multiple "files" on a single cache device, and thus began the modern use of the term
 sitis ke sanchika naamon main do hisse the, ek prayokta-pathneey "pradhan naam" or doosraa "apradhan naam" jo sanchika kaa prakaar bataata tha
 This practice is still practiced by many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows
 yun to aajkal prayukt "register sanchika" sanchikaon kii praarambhik pariklpana darshaati he, kintu yah praayah lupt ho chuki he

 yah ek pramukh khel kaa maidan hai | a comet is a solar system that consists of small blocks made of stone, dust, ice and gas

 Comets with short paths complete the orbit of the Sun in an elliptical path in about 6 to 200 years
 kuch dhoomaketu kaa path valayakaar hota he or wo maatr ek baar hi dikhaai dete he
 Comets with long paths take thousands of years to orbit one
 adhiktar dhoomaketu barf, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia tathaa anya padaarth jaise silicket or carbonic mishran ke bane hote he
 a comet has three main parts - naabhi dhoomaketu kaa kendra hota he jo pathar or barf kaa bana hota he
 a cloud of gas and dissolves around the navel is called a coma
 naabhi tathaa coma se nikalne vaali gas or dhul ek poonch kaa aakaar le leti he
 When the comet comes closer to the Sun, the umbilical gases evaporate due to the effect of solar radiation
 isse coma kaa aakaar badhkar karodon mile tak ho jaataa he
 The gas and dissolves from the coma takes the shape of a long question
 saura-hawa ke kaaran yah puch surya se ulti disha main hoti he
 As the comet approaches the Sun, the tail size increases
 dhoomaketu ke bhautik gun neeche sarini main diya gaya he - The comet is classified on the basis of its orbit
 The orbits of comets with short orbits are smaller than 200 years, while the orbits of long-sighted comets are under the Sun's gravity, despite being very long
 Due to the solo orbiting orbit of parabola, such comets once circled the sun and go out of the solar system forever
 The orbit of the Anke Comet with smaller orbit lies between the Sun and the Guru
 It is believed that smokers with short orbit originate in the Kuiper belt, while long-haul axes originate in the Oort cloud
 It is believed that comets hold a long orbit when the Sun passes near a star orbiting the galaxy or when the Sun's possible companion star, Nemesis or Planet X, comes close to it
 kam dravyaman or andakaar kaksha ke kaaran dhoomaketu kabhi kabhi bade grahon kii taraf aakarshith hote he or isse uski kaksha par asar padataa he | choti kaksha vaale dhumaketuon kaa ek centre bade grahon kii kaksha ke andar sthit hota he | yah spasht he ki urt badal se aane vaale dhumaketuon kii kaksha par bade grahon kaa asar padataa he | badi sankhya main aise dhumaketuon par vishesh rup se brihaspati kaa asar padataa he jiskaa dravyaman soramandal ke anya sabhi grahon ke dravyaman se bhi zyada he | Sometimes the previously discovered comets are lost due to the effect on the orbit
 Sometimes it happens that after thorough study of the newly discovered comets, they are identified as missing comets
 11P / Temple - Swift - Linear Comet is an example of this
 He was first seen in 1869, after 1908 Jupiter's influence changed its orbit and it disappeared somewhere in space
 He was rediscovered in 2001 by a scientist named Linear

 uski utpatti das-swami samaaj main ek aise vigyaan ke rup main hui jisane vastugat jagat tathaa swayan apane vishay main manushya ke gyaan ke sakal yoga ko aikyabaddh kiya tha
 This was completely natural due to the low level of development of knowledge in the early stages of human history
 saamaajik utpaadan ke vikaas or vaigyanik gyaan ke sanchay kii prakriya main bhinn bhinn vigyaan darshanashastra se pruthak hote gayi or darshanashastra ek swatantra vigyaan ke rup main viksit hone laga
 Philosophy was born as a distinct discipline with the need to expand the general view of the world and to develop general principles and rules, to develop rational, rational and rational principles of thinking about reality
 pruthak vigyaan ke rup main darshan kaa aadharbhoot prashn swatv ke saath chintan ke, bhootadravya ke saath chetana ke sambandh kii samasya he
 Philosophy is the analysis of various disciplines
 isaliye bhartiya darshan main chetana kii mimasaa anivaary he jo aadhunik darshan main nahin
 The ultimate goal of human life is the attainment of eternal bliss by getting rid of sorrows
 bhartiya darshanon kaa bhi ek hi lakshya dukhon ke mul kaaran agyaan se maanav ko mukti dilaakar use moksh kii prapti karwaanaa he
 That is, the main purpose of life is to achieve true knowledge by destroying ignorance and traditionalist and orthodox views
 sanathan kaal se hi maanav main jigyaasa or anveshan kii pravriti rahi he
 Apart from the emergence of nature and the position of the Sun, Moon and planets, the curiosity to know about God has also been there in humans
 in jigyaasaaon kaa shaman karne ke liye uske anwarat prayaas kaa hi yah fal he ki ham log itane viksit samaaj main rah rahe hai
 But the ancient sages-sages were neither satisfied with this material prosperity nor had ever attained everlasting joy
 at: unhone isi satya or gyaan kii prapti ke kram main sookshm se sookshm evam guautam sadhano se gyaan kii talash aarambh kii or isamen unhen safalataa bhi praapt hui
 The name of that true knowledge is philosophy

 iske vipareet kuch udhaaharan avashya milengen jisamen aacharan shuddhi tathaa manas kii parishuddhta ke aadhaar par paramsatta ke saath saakshaatkaar karne kaa bhi adarsh paaya jaataa he
 But this ideal is oriental and not westernized
 paashchaatya darshanik apane gyaan par jor detaa he or apane gyaan ke anuroop apane charitra kaa sanchaalan karnaa anivaary nahin samajhataa
 The only exceptions are Western mystics and socialist thinkers
 bhartiya darshan main param satta ke saath saakshaatkaar karne kaa doosraa naam hi darshan hai
 According to the Indian tradition, man can have a knowledge of ultimate power
 is prakaar saakshaatkaar ke liye bhakthi gyaan tathaa yoga ke maarg bataae gaye hai
 But philosophical knowledge is said to be different from scientific knowledge
 vaigyanik gyaan praapt karne main aalochay vishay main parivartan karnaa padataa he taaki use apni ichha ke anusaar vash main kiya ja sake or phir uskaa icchit upyog kiya ja sake
 But according to oriental philosophy, philosophical knowledge is the practice of life
 aise darshan se swayan darshanik main hi parivartan ho jaataa he
 He gets divine vision
 jiske dwaara vah samast praaniyon ko apni samshti drushti se dekhtaa he

 hamaari gyanendriyaan baahar kii ore khulti hai, ham praaia: bahya jagat main villin rahete hai
 Sometimes we are focused and we see a new world
 tathy to dikhaai dete hi hai, naitik bhaavana aadesh bhi detii he
 The distinction of reality and possibility expresses the suffix of the ideal
 is pratyay ke prabhaav main ham upar kii ore dekhte hai
 In this way the main subjects of philosophy become external world, conscious soul and divine being
 inpar vichaar karte hue ham swabhaavat: inke sambandho par bhi vichaar karte hai
 In ancient times, the relationship between creation and creator was the main topic, in the medieval period, the relation of soul and God became the major subject and in modern times the relation of man and nature, matter and subject, became the center of Viven

 The goal of philosophers was to find out the system of the whole
 jab kabhi prathit hua ki is anveshan main manushya kii buddhi aage ja nahin sakati, to kuch gaun siddhant vivechan ke vishay bane
 In Greece, this happened after Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and in Germany after Kant and Hagel
 yatharthwaad or ndehwaad aise hi siddhant hai
 In this way, the subjects which have been specially discussed in philosophical discussion, these are: mukhya vishay - Minor subjects - in vishyon ko vichaarkon ne apni apni ruchi ke anusaar vividh pakshon se dekha he
 Someone has paid special attention to one side, someone on the other side
