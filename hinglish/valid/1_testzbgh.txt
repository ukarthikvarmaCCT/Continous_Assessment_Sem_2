 Anyone who has studied animal life by traveling around the world knows that the distribution of animals in the world is not the same everywhere, although animals are found in every corner of the world
 sansar ke har bhaag ke jantu uske apane hote hai, arthath austrailia main paae janevaale jantu bharat main nahin paae jate or bharat main paae janevaale jantu europe main nahin milte
 Perhaps one reason for this is that animals have less adaptive power
 isaliye ek bhaag kii jalwaayu main panapanevaale praani duusare bhaag kii jalwaayu main punap nahin pate
 Sometimes it is also the case that there is a suitable environment for the animal of a particular caste, but it cannot reach there due to special obstacles
 kuch aise bhi jaanavar hai jo apane aadi nivasasthaan ko chhodkar duusare deshon ko chale gaye or vahaan bhalee-bhanti panape, jaise khargosh austrailia main, nevala jameka main or angreji spairo america main
 The study of distribution of animals is called 'animal-expansion-science'
 yah jantushastra kii ek vishesh shakha he
 Zoology is studied in many ways
 pehle jaanwaron ke vistaar kaa adhyayan prithvi kii sataha par kiya jaataa he, jise bhugolic vistaar yaa kshaitij vistaar kehete hai
 After this, we study the expansion of animals from the top of the mountain to the depth of the sea
 ise urdhwadhar yaa sheershalamb sambandhi vistaar, athwa udagr vistaar kehete hai
 Both these expansions are called extension of leisure
 iske atirikt jaanwaron ke ""kaal main vistaar"" kaa adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he, jise bhuvaigyanik bistaar kehete hai
 It is studied with the help of geology
 prayek praani kaa adhyayan teenon pakshon ke antargat ho saktaa he, parantu jantuvistaar kaa puraa gyaan praapt karne ke liye teenon pakshon kaa alag alag adhyayan karnaa aavashyak he
 No matter how small the number, each caste has its own area
 lambey samay tak lagaataar prajnan hote rahane ke kaaran inaki sankhya itani bad jaati he ki prastut kshetra inke liy kam ho jaataa he; isliye kshetra ke badhaav ke liye jati kaa vistaar hota he
 Food content also decreases due to increase in numbers
 yah bhi vistaar kaa prerak he
 Caste is expanded by transfer
 praaia: jati prakritik rukaawaton ko bhi paar karke apana kshetra badhaati he
 It is thus clear that there are two main reasons for the expansion: jeevasankhya kii vruddhi or Changing environment
 jeevasankhya main vruddhi kaa dabaav teevr gati se prajnan kaa kaaran hota he
 Due to this, there is shortage of food and competition among themselves increases
 ek hi jati ke sadasyon ke bich spardhaa ke saath saath anya sambandhi jati se bhi pratidwandvita prarambh ho jaati he
 This causes the caste to move to a new place for its protection
 prayek sthaan kaa jalwaayu parivartansheel hota he, jo sadaa dhire-dhire badalata rahata he
 In such a state, it is but natural that after continuous change for a long period, the atmosphere of a particular place is no longer habitable to that caste
 ab us jati ke liye do hi raste rah jate hai, ek he sthanantaran or doosraa vilop
 If the means of getting out after crossing the natural barriers are obtained, then that caste leaves that place and moves to a new place and if these means are not found and suitable routes are not found, then that caste becomes extinct
 hathi or ghodon ke jeevashmon ke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki jab bhi avasar mila, ye ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko jate rahe hai or isi kaaran inaki jati vilupt hone se batch gai
 Animals migrate from many routes
 ye maarg vaataavaran kii paristhitiyon tathaa prakritik rukaawaton par nirbhar karte hai
 Despite the obstacles, there are many other means by which animals migrate, such as air, water, earth bridges, natural fleets and floating wood, etc
 kuch jaanavar apana kshetra apni udaan shakti kii sahaayta se badhaate hai
 Birds, bats, butterflies and its related insects are good examples of such creatures
 hawa ke jhonke or prachand vaayu bhi jaanwaron ke vistaar main sahaayta dete hai
 With the help of wind current, moths and their related insects can fly continuously for long flights
 ek ullekh ke anusaar plion naamak ek jahaaj ko kep verde tapuon se 960 mile dakshin-pashchim kii ore kuch fatinge mili the
 They belonged to the eastern metropolitan countries, which had been blown away by the wind, intercourse flight of bees and other insects also helps in their expansion
 pakshiyon kaa pravrajan vitaran kaa aashcharya main daalanevaala udhaaharan he
 Can fly with great speed from several hundred to thousands of miles
 aisa anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki junglee hans 60 se lekar 75 mile prati ghante tak kii gati se udata he or awaabil 90 mile prati ghante kii gati se
 At the same speed, it can fly continuously for 10 to 12 hours
 prithvi par rahanevaali chidiyaan prithvi se dur aitlantic mahaasaagar ke bich main pai gai hai
 Their eastern and western winds often blow with them
 chamagadad saare sansar main milte hai, samudr main sthit tapuon main bhi
 This proves that air waves help animals expand
 kuch jaanwaron kaa pravrajan jal dwaara hota he
 They either swim on their own or the water carries them away
 kuch aise hai, jo pani par tairte hue kooday karkat par baithkar chale jate hai
 Many animals cross the waterway by sitting on logs, or other objects floating on water
 anek dhruvapradeshy jaanavar barf ke tukdon par baithkar lambii yatraayen kar daalate hai
 Some animals make long trips up to 240 miles in this way
 kuch jaanavar is tarah 240 mile tak lambii yatra karte paae gaye hai
 The polar bear bears flow in this way in search of their food
 prithvi par jaanwaron kaa vistaar kisi vishesh jati kii gati se bhi hota he
 Groups of animals keep moving to one place
 is prakaar ke pravrajan kii pravriti anek jati ke jaanwaron main pai jaati he
 Natural bridges of the earth are often found between large continents, from which animals can easily come
 suez or panama ke prakritik pul iske udhaaharan hai
 Panama's bridge is particularly interesting, because we also know the history of its origin
 uttar america or uresia ke jaanwaron main bhi isi tarah kaa sambandh he
 Previously, these two states were connected to each other by a natural bridge
 yah prakritik pul us sthaan par tha jahaan is samay bering street jalsandhi he
 It is called the Bridge of Alaska
 jaanwaron ke ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak ke avaagaman ko pravrajan kehete hai
 In fact, migration is a movement that is driven by changing seasons
 jis prakaar rituen aati jaati hai or surya kii ayangati hoti rahati he, vaise hi jaanwaron ke pravrajan bhi hua karte hai
 Many animals, which have a special ability to move, walk with the sun
 jab surya uttar kii ore jaataa he tab ye uttar kii ore jate hai or jab dakshin kii ore jaataa he, tab ye bhi dakshin kii ore jate hai
 There are two main forms of migration, although there is not much difference between them
 ghaas khaanevaale lagbhag sabhi jaanavar samoohon main rahete hai
 They require high amounts of food
 sheeghra hi ye kisi sthaan kii khaadya saamagree kha daalate hai or duusare sthaan ko chal padate hai
 These animals are called excursions
 ye nity hi bhojan ke atirikt pani or hinsak jaanwaron se suraksha kii khoj main ghoomte rahete hai
 Some animals go far and wide with seasonal changes
 kuch pahaad kii chotiyon par chadh jate hai athwa unpar se utar aate hai
 This is called vertical migration
 pahaad kii chotii se neeche tak taap, ardrata aadi ke str main adhik antar hota he
 So as soon as one climbs the mountain, one feels that he has gone through many types of climate
 kuch jaanavar hai, jo keval prithvi kii sataha par pravrajan karte hai
 This type of migration is called horizontal migration
 uttari canada kaa caribu garmiyon main uttar kii ore or hemanth main dakshin kii ore chalata he
 Examples of migrations of grass-fed wild animals differ from those of domesticated animals
 paaltu jaanavar charvaahe ke sanketon par chalate hai, parantu junglee jaanavar ant: prerana ke bal par
 It is estimated that the Gawal of North America has migrated from many latitudes
 badi badi duuriwale pravrajan bhi sthaneey avaagaman ke vistrut rup maane jate hai, kyonki inkaa mukhya kaaran bhi bhojan kii khoj hi he
 The second reason for migration is the tendency to protect the child
 anek nimnastar ke praani janm ke samay mata-pita ke rup se bhinn hote hai or bhojan bhi bhinn prakaar kaa karte hai
 Therefore, the mother usually lays eggs in a place where all the things that will be useful for children in the future are accessible and sufficient
 aisa karne ke liye unhen anda dene ke liye praaia: dur dur tak janaa padataa he
 The example of such migration is found in birds
 kuch jantu apni ant:prerana ke bal par apana janmasthan pahchaan lete hai or apane bacchon ke laalan-paalan ke liye bhi ve apane janmasthan par waapas aa jate hai
 Retired from motherhood, they go back to where they came from
 vahaan aane par yaa to unki mrityu ho jaati he yaa ve duusari ritu main pun: andey dene ke liye apni janmabhumi main pahunch jate hai
 Both these forms of migration are real examples of seasonal movement
 chaahe praani prabhavit ho, chaahe ek peedi, ye pravrajan usee tarah swat: hote hai jaise prithvi kii gati 
 It is caused by the inspiration of the seasons
 samyaanukoolta tathaa gamansthanper punaragaman isaki visheshta he
 Irregular migration is also found in some sparrows

 It runs from Feijo to New Zealand and comes back
 yah donon sthaan 1,500 mile kii duuri par hai
 The golden plover of Asia travels 2,000 miles from Alaska to Hawaii, not resting on the way
 pravrajan kyon hota he, iskaa mukhya kaaran nahin maaloom, parantu kuch aisi pravritiyaan maaloom hai, jinaki prarena se pravrajan hota he
 Prominent among these is the underdeveloped infatuation of birds and access to food in a new area
 kuch jaanavar praaia: ek hi kshetra main simit rah jate hai
 Apart from the physical condition and environment of the area, the movement of animals is also dependent on natural barriers
 ye baadhaayen bhinn bhinn prakaar kii hoti hai : Climatic, Geographical and Biological
 inamen taap, ardrata tathaa prakaash ullekhneey hai
 Heat is an important cause of animal expansion
 taap asamtapi praaniyon ke vistaar par adhik prabhaav daalata he
 The temperature of incommensurable beings decreases with the temperature of the environment
 isliye ye na adhik garmi sah sakate hai or na adhik sardi
 Amphibians and Urags are found in warm and temperate parts and tend to decrease towards Dhruv regions
 ghadiyal ushn tathaa shitoshna deshon main paae jate hai, kachhue 50 degree uttar akshansh tak paae jate hai
 The lizard does not meet after 60 degrees latitude

 ardrata kii vruddhi bhi kuch vishesh jaanwaron ke vistaar main baadha daalati he
 It is clear that the excess of humidity creates a marshy environment, which many animals are unable to conquer
 bhugolic baadhaon ke antargat samudron, nadiyon, pahaado tathaa registaanon kii gananaa hoti he
 The Himalayas have huge ranges in the north of India
 har prakaar ke jaanavar ise paar nahin kar pate
 Sparrows do not fly even above its snowy peaks
 isi kaaran iske uttar main paae janevaale praani dakshin main paae janevaale praaniyon se bilkul bhinn hai
 Parallel ranges of the equator have a greater influence on the extension of animals than the ranges in the north-south direction
 is tarah himalay parvat sansar kii sabase mahatvapurn baadhaon main se ek he
 The western United States ranges influence the expansion
 prashanth mahaasaagar se aanevaali hawaayen jyonhi in parvatamalaon se guzarati hai, apni nami chhodti jaati hai or jaisaa pehle batalaaya ja chukaa he, keval is nami kaa prabhaav jantuvistaar par padataa he

 Nevertheless, there are some fish, salmon and sturgeon, which come once a year from saline water to fresh water
 il main iske vipareet avaagaman hota he
 Saline water poses a serious barrier to modern amphibians, because saline water acts as a poison for them
 isaliye fiji, solomon tathaa newcaladonia aadi tapuon ko chhodkar anya tapuon tak yah nahin pahunche hai

 standhari praani bhi bade bade jalaashyon ko adhik sankhya main paar nahin kar patedya ye jal main adhik se adhik 50 mile tak tair sakate hai
 Mammal creatures like whale and seal are the exception, as the reservoir does not obstruct their distribution
 jaiguar jaise kushal tairaak dakshini america kii badi se badi nadiyon ko paar kar jate hai, parantu ve samudr main adhik dur nahin ja pate
 Water is very dear to lions, elephants and deer etc
, but perhaps they also do not like to go away from the earth
 jantuon ke vitaran sambandhi visheshgy hillprin kaa kahana he ki prithvi par rahanevaale bahut se standhari praani, jo europe ke bade se bade jalaashyon ko paar karne ke liye tatpar rahete hai, samudr ke 50 mile lambey bhaag athwa iske aadhe se adhik bhaag ko hi paar karne ke liye aasaani se taiyaar na honge
 They are often related to the habitat
 praaia: yah dekha gaya he ki kisi duusare sthaan se aae jaanavar nae sthaan main bad nahin pate
 Sometimes they die from lack of food and sometimes from the abundance of enemies
 vanaspati kii ghani paidaavaar kuch jaanwaron ke vitaran kaa saadhan ban jaati he, to kuch ke liye baadha
 Vegetation has both direct and indirect effects on distribution
 ghaney jangalon ke pedo par rahanevaale jaanavar aviral jangalon ko paar nahin kar pate
 Similarly, somewhere the forests are so dense that the big animals living on the earth cannot cross them

 In order to celebrate this great improvement to our daily lives, Dondinho named me Edson, a tribute to Thomas Edison, the inventor of the lightbulb
 In fact, on My birth certificate i am actually called Edison with an 'i', a mistake that persists to this day
 I'm Edson with no 'i', but to my eternal annoyance quite often the 'i' appears on official or personal documents and time after time i have to explain why

 This is another mistake that carries on to this day
 When i took out my first passport, the date was put in as 21 October and each time i have renewed it the date has stayed the same

 To reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies (or more), some countries have imposed limits on the number of embryos to be transferred, but these limits are not followed or accepted at all locations
 There is a spontaneous division of embryos in the uterus after transfer, but it is very rare and it gives birth to identical identical twins

 The center of a recent controversy in California was the question of whether physicians opposing homosexual relationships should be required to provide IVF treatment for a lesbian couple
 Guadeloupe T
 Benitez, a medical assistant in San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her to "help gays conceive by artificial insemination
" But she has religion-based objections, "and Fenton suggested her on the basis of the guided fertility drug Clomid Dob State to be rejected

 The Roman Catholic Church opposes all forms of artificial environmental fertilization because, like contraception, in the process the reproductive purpose of the marital act is separated from its intended purpose: carch ke magisterium dwaara aksar varnit yah vishesh siddhant ishwar dwaara sthapit us atoot sambandh par aadhaarit he jise manushya nahin tod saktaa
 yah sambandh us mail karaane vaale mahatv or prajananeey mahatv ke bich he jo donon hi vaivaahik krity kaa hissaa hai
 The reason for this is that the basic nature of the matrimonial act is that while the act brings the husband and wife closer to full intimacy, it also gives them the ability to give birth to a new life

 This union that gives existence to an infant is no longer the act in which two individuals entrust themselves to each other, but rather an act in which "the life and identity of the fetus is trusted by physicians and biologists Handed over and thus this act establishes technology's dominance over the basic nature of man and his fate

" The Catholic Church believes that infertility is a call from God to adopt children because gospel main yah darshaya gaya he ki anurvarataa koi ghor pope nahin he
 The spouse who suffers from infertility despite having all the medical treatment validly, should imbibe himself with the cross of God, the source of complete spiritual fertility
 They can express their generosity by adopting abandoned children or providing rigorous services to others

 If the renold number of a flow is small, that speed will have a significant effect on viscosity and will give a flow like sire, or heavy oil
 pariklpit ashyaan taral ke siddhant kaa ek nishkarsh yah he ki yadi koi pind aise taral main chalata he jo keval pind ke kaaran hi viramavastha ko chode hue he, to pind ke parit: pravaahprakaar adwitiya rup se pind ke aakaar or uski gati se nirdhaarit ho jaataa he or pindprishth ke vibhinn binduon par taral jo dabaav lagaataa he, unka parinami shunya hota hai, bhale hi unka aghurna shunya na ho
 This condition is available on a plane lobe such as a flat flow body
