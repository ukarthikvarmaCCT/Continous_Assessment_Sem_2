 After saying this, Ved Vyas left from there
 paanchal desh kii yatra karte-karte pandav raatri ke samay shrayan tirth main pahunche
 Gandharvaraj Chitraratha was staying there with his women
 pandavon ko aate dekh chitrarath ne dur hi se kaha, “saavdhaan! is samay yahan par kisi kaa bhi pravesh varjit he kyonki raatri ke samay jal par purna rup se gandharvon kaa adhikaar hota he
 You can enter here only after being up in the morning
 ” chitrarath ke vachanon ko sun kar arjuna krodhit hokar bole, “are murkh! nadi, pahaad, samudr par kisi kaa bhi koi adhikaar nahin hota
 Then Ganga is the mother of all, no one can have authority over them
 ” arjuna ke aisa kehane par chitrarath ne arjuna par vifaille baanon kii bauchhaar karnaa armbh kar diya
 Arjuna responded to those poisonous arrows with fiery arrows, and Chitraratha fell in the ground when his arrows were injured
 tatkaal arjuna uske baalo ko pakad kar use ghasitate huye yudhisthir ke paas le gayi
 Seeing the plight of Chitraratha, his wife named Kumbhanasi mourned and came to Yudhishthira and started begging for her husband's life
 stri kii prarthana se dravit ho kar yudhisthir ne chitrarath ko kshamaadaan karte huye mukt kar diya
 Kantrith Chitraratha apologized to the Pandavas and said, "I am very impressed by the strength of your people and admit my mistake
 yadi aap logon ko sweekaar ho to main aapke saath mitrataa karnaa chahta hoon
 The Pandavas accepted his friendship
 mitrataa ho jane par chitrarath ne pandavon ko chakshusi vidya kaa prayog sikhaaya jisase ve sookshm se sookshm vastu ko dekh sakate the kintu ve kisi ko drushtigochar nahin ho sakate the
 In return, Arjun taught Gandharvaraj Chitraratha to use firearms
 iske pashchaat chitrarath gandharvalok chale gayi or pandavon ne paanchal ke liye prasthaan kiya
 On the way, the Pandavas met a Brahmin named Dhaumya and disguised as Brahmins with him and reached the Swayamvara of Draupadi
 swayamvar sabha main anek deshon ke raja-maharaja evam rajkumaar padhaare huye the
 On one hand, Shri Krishna was seated with his elder brother Balarama and distinguished Yaduvanshis
 vahaan ve brahmanon kii pankti main ja kar baith gayi
 Shortly after, Princess Draupadi arrived at the meeting with her brother Dhritadhyumna holding a garland in her hand
 dhridhyumna ne sabha ko sambodhit karte huye kaha, “he vibhinn desh se padhaare raja-maharaajaaon evam anya ganmaanya janon! is mandap main bane stambh ke upar bane huye us ghoomte huye yantra par dhyaan dijiye
 a fish is hanging in that machine and is moving around with the machine
 aapako stambh ke neeche rakhe huye tailpaatr main machhlee ke pratibimb ko dekhte huye baan chalaa kar machhlee kii aankh ko nishaanaa bananaa he
 My sister Draupadi will be married to a successful shooter in the eye of a fish
 ” One after the other, all the kings and princes tried to target the fish, but the success did not happen and they returned to their places without any trouble
 in asafal logon main jaraasang, shalya, shishupal tathaa duryodhana duhshasan aadi kaurav bhi sammilit the
 When the Kauravas failed, Karna, the best friend of Duryodhana, raised the bow to target the fish, but Draupadi said looking at them, "this is a thread, so i cannot recite it
" ” draupadi ke vachanon ko sun kar karn ne lajjit ho kar dhanush baan rakh diya
 After that Arjuna rose from the line of Brahmins and lifted the bow to aim
 ek brahman ko rajkumaari ke swayamvar ke liye udyat dekh vahaan upasthit janon ko atyant aashcharya hua kintu brahmanon ke kshatriyon se adhik shreshth hone ke kaaran se unhen koi roak na sakaa
 Seeing the image of the fish in the oil tank, Arjuna pierced the eye of the fish with a single arrow
 draupadi ne aage bad kar arjuna ke gale main varmala daal diya
 All the Kshatriya kings-maharajas and princes got angry and attacked Arjuna after seeing Draupadi putting a garland on the neck of a Brahmin
 arjuna kii sahaayta ke liye shesh pandav bhi aa gayi or pandavon tathaa kshatriya raajaaon main ghamaasan yuddh hone laga
 Sri Krishna had already recognized Arjuna, so he defended the middle and calm the war
 duryodhana ne bhi anumaan laga liya ki nishaanaa lagane vaala arjuna hi rahaa hoga or uskaa saath dene vaale shesh pandav rahe honge
 He was very surprised when Pandavas escaped from Lakshagraha of Varanavat
 pandav draupadi ko saath le kar vahaan pahunche jahaan ve apni mata kunti ke saath nivas kar rahe the
 From the door itself, Arjun called out to his mother and said, “mother! Today we have brought a wonderful alms for you
 ” us par kunti ne bheetar se hi kaha, “putron! tum log aapas main mil-baant uskaa upbhog kar lo
 "later on knowing that beggar was in the form of a bride, Kunti was deeply repentant but Draupadi accepted the five Pandavas as her husband in order to prove the mother's words to be true
 pandavon ke draupadi ko saath le kar apane nivas par pahunchne ke kuch kaal pashchaat unke peeche-peeche krishna bhi vahaan par aa pahunche
 Krishna received his blessing by touching the feet of his aunt Kunti and embraced all the Pandavas
 aupchaariktaayen purna hone ke pashchaat yudhisthir ne krishna se poocha, “he dwarikadhish! aapane hamaare is agyatavaas main hamen pahchaan kaise liya?” krishna ne uttar diya, “bhim or arjuna ke parakram ko dekhne ke pashchaat bhala main aap logon ko kaise na pahachaanata
 After meeting everyone, Krishna went to his city of Dwarka
 phir paanchon bhaaiyon ne bhikshavriti se bhojan saamagree ekatrit kiya or use laakar mata kunti ke saamne rakh diya
 Kunti said to Draupadi, "devi! Remove the excerpts of the gods before this begging
 phir brahmanon ko bhiksha do
 Then separate the fraction of dependents
 uske baad jo shesh bache uskaa aadha bhaag bhim ko or shesh aadha bhaag ham sabhi ko bhojan ke liye paroso
 Pativrata Draupadi followed Kunti's order
 bhojan ke pashchaat kushasan par mrigcharm bicha kar ve so gayi
 Draupadi slept towards Mother's feet
 draupadi ke swayamvar ke samay duryodhana ke saath hi saath drupad, dhristadyumna evam anek anya logon ko andeh ho gaya tha ki ve brahman pandav hi hai
 To test him, Drupada sent Dhrishtadyumna and summoned him to his kingdom
 rajaprasaad main drupad evam dhridhyumna ne pehle rajkosh ko dikhaaya kintu pandavon ne vahaan rakhe ratnabhushanon tathaa ratna-maaniky aadi main kisi prakaar kii ruchi nahin dikhaai
 But when they went to the armory, all the weapons kept there showed great interest and kept the weapons of their choice with them
 unke kriya-kalap se drupad ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ye brahman ke rup main yoddha hi hai
 Drupada asked Yudhishthira, "O Arya! Seeing your might, i am convinced that you are not Brahmins
 krupa karke aap apana sahi parichay dijiye
 After listening to his words, Yudhishthira said, "rajan! Your statement is literally true
 ham pandu-putr pandav hai
 i am Yudhishthira and these are my brothers Bhimsen, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva
 hamaari mata kunti aapaki putree draupadi ke saath aapke mahal main hai
 " yudhisthir kii baat sun kar drupad atyant prasann huye or bole, “aaj bhagwaan ne meri sun lee
 i wanted my daughter to be married to Pandu's mighty son Arjun
 main aaj hi arjuna or draupadi ke vidhivat vivaah kaa prabandh karata hoon
 On this Yudhishthira said, "rajan! Draupadi is to be married to all five of us
 ” yah sun kar drupad aashcharyachakit ho gayi or bole, “yah kaise sambhav he? ek purush kii anek patniyaan avashya ho sakati hai, kintu ek stri ke paanch pati hon aisa to na kabhi dekha gaya he or na suna hi gaya he
 Yudhishthira said, "rajan! Neither do i ever give false speech nor do i do anything against religion or scripture
 hamaari mata ne ham sabhi bhaaiyon ko draupadi kaa upbhog karne kaa aadesh diya he or main mata kii ajna kii avhelnaa kadaapi nahin kar saktaa
 "at the same time, Ved Vyasa resided there and he told Drupada that he was pleased with the penance in Draupadi's previous birth and gave her the gift of getting five mighty husbands by Lord Shankar
 vedavyas ji ke vachanon ko sun kar drupad kaa sandeh samaapt ho gaya or unhone apni putree draupadi kaa panigrahan sanskaar paanchon pandavon ke saath bade dhoomdhaam ke saath kar diya
 The special thing happened in this marriage, that Devarshi Narada himself came and blessed Draupadi to become Kanyarupa everyday
 pandavon ke jivit hone tathaa draupadi ke saath vivaah hone kii baat teji se sabhi ore fail gai
 Upon receiving this news in Hastinapur, the grief of Duryodhana and his associates was out of sync
 ve pandavon ko unka rajya lautaanaa nahin chaahate the kintu bhishma, vidura, dron aadi ke dwaara dhritarashtra ko samajhane tathaa dabaav daalane ke kaaran unhen pandavon ko rajya kaa aadha hissaa dene ke liye vivash hona pad gaya
 Vidur brought the Pandavas, Dhritarashtra, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Vikarna, Chitrasen, etc
 all received him and a part of the kingdom named Khandav Van was given to him
 pandavon ne us khandav van main ek nagari kii sthapana karke uskaa naam indraprastha rakhaa tathaa indraprastha ko rajdhani bana kar rajya karne lage
 Due to the popularity of Yudhishthira, most of the people of the Kaurava kingdom settled in the Pandavas' kingdom

 The following sequence of numbers in mathematics is called Hemachandra series or Fibonacci series: paribhaasha ke anusaar, pehali do hemchandra sankhyaayein 0 or 1 hai
 Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers

 In mathematical terms, the f n sequence of Fibonacci numbers can be represented by the rotation relation- tathaa, The Fibonacci sequence is named after Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa, who was known as Fibonacci

 Like every sequence defined by linear rotation, the Fibonacci number has a whole-formula solution
 It is known as the Binet Sutra, although he was previously known as Abraham de Moivre: 
 Fibonacci Repatriation svarnim anupaat ke nirdharak sameekaran ke samaan nimnatah he Which is known as the productive polynomial of alternation
 uparyukt sameekaran kaa koi mul x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}x^{2}=x+1, \ end{matrix}} \ ,} kaa samaadhaan karata he or x n − 1 { \ displaystyle x^{n-1} \ ,} dwaara guna karne se nimna darshata he: By definition φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, is the root of the equation and the second root is 1 - φ = - 1 / φ
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ , = - 1 / \ varphi \ ,
}
 So: or Both φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n = n { \ displaystyle ^ {n} = ^ {n}} are geometric series that solve the Fibonacci alternation
 The first series expands exponentially; The second, exponentially, with alternating signs, leads to zero
 Since the Fibonacci alternation is linear, any linear combination of these two series can also solve the alternation
 These linear combinations create a two-dimensional linear vector difference; The original Fibonacci sequence can be found in this difference

 + F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11 × 5n = −2: F−2+F−1+F0+


+F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11×3 It can be easily seen that if the units of the Fibonacci sequence take mod n, then the resulting sequence with at most n 2 rotations must be iterative

 a female will have 2 parents, a female and a male
 The female will have two parents, one male and one female and one male female
 Those two females each had two parents and one male
 This sequence of numbers of parents is a Fibonacci sequence

 The Pentium dual-core brand was used for Intel's mainstream x86-structured microprocessors from 2006 to 2009 when it was renamed Pentium
 procesar yaa to 32-bit vaale yonah yaa 64-bit vaale merom-2em, alendel or woolfdel-3em kor par aadhaarit hai, jo mobile yaa desktop computer ko lakshya kar taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Pentium dual-core processors are placed above the Celeron but below the Core and Core 2 in Intel's product types, according to features, price, and performance in the given clock frequency
 pentium dul-kor overklocking ke liye bhi adhik lokapriy pasand tha, kyonki yah kam keemat par sarvshereshth pradarshan pradaan kar saktaa he
 In 2006, Intel announced plans to reintroduce low-cost core microarchitecture processors based on single-core conro-l but less than 1 megabyte of cash as a structural product after the Pentium trademark was removed from the market 
 The identification numbers of those employed pentiums were similar to the subsequent pentium dual-core microprocessors, but the first digit being "1" instead of "2", indicated their single-core viability
 1 mabibite cash vaala ek single-kor conro-l ko utana sakasham nahin mana gaya ki vah niojit pentiyamon kaa seleronon ke saath antar kar saktaa tha, isliye uskaa sthaan dul-kor vaale sipiu ne le liya or "dul-kor" ko us shrenee main shaamil kar liya
 Throughout 2009, Intel changed the name from Pentium dual-core to Pentium in its publications
 Some processors were sold under both names, but recent E5400 to E6800 desktops and SU4100 / T4x00 mobile processors were not officially part of the Pentium dual-core range
 is brands kaa upyog karne vaala pratham procesar 2007 ke aarambh main notebook computer main dikhaai diya
 pentium T2060, T2080 or T2130 naam vaale un processron main 32-bit kaa pentium M-vyutpann yonah kor tha, evam vah 2 megabite cash ke sthaan par 1 megabite vaale L2 cash kaa prayog kiye jane ke apwaad ke sivaay kor duo T2050 ke lagbhag samaan tha
 All three of them had a 533 mhz FSB that connected the CPU to memory
 intel ne laptop nirmaataaon ke anurodh par pentium dul-kor viksit kiya
 Subsequently on June 3, 2007, Intel released desktop Pentium dual-core branded processors known as the E2140 and E2160
 baad main sitambar 2007 main ek E2180 model jari kiya gaya
 These processors support Intel 64 extensions, which are based on the recent 64-bit core microarchitectored Allendale core
 ve 2 megabite cash ke sthaan par 1 megabite vaale L2 cash kaa prayog kiye jane ke apwaad ke sivaay kor 2 duo E4300 procesar ke lagbhag samaan the
 They both had an 800 mhz FSB
 unhone intel seleron se upar ke procesar vaale saste bazaar ko apana lakshya banaaya jinaki visheshta keval 512 kilobite vaali L2 cash thi
 One such move brought a change to the Pentium brand and shifted it to the cheaper category, rather than its former position with the mainstream / premium brand
 These are highly capable of overclocking cpus
 alendel procesar ke mobile sanskaran merom-2m ko bhi 2007 main shuru kiya gaya, jisaki visheshta 1 megabite vaali L2 cash kintu T23xx processron ke saath keval 533 MT / s FSB thi
 The bus clock was later increased to 667 MT / s for T3xxx Pentium processors made from the same dye
 intel dwaara 45 nanometer vaale E5200 model ko agast 31, 2008 ko jari kiya gaya, jisamen 65 nanometer vaale E21xx shrinkhalaa main 2 megabite kii L2 cash or 2
5 gigahertz kii kaald gati thi
 The E5200 model is also a highly capable processor to overclock, with some highly enthusiastic models achieving a clock speed of up to 6 ghz using liquid nitrogen refrigeration
 intel ne is kor kaa upyog karte hue E6500K model jari kiya
 The model features an open multiplier, but is currently being sold only in China
 penrin kor merom kor evam intel ke pentium dul-kor microprocessron kii mobile shrinkhalaa ke 45 nanometer sanskaran kaa parvarti he
 In this the FSB is increased from 667 mhz to 800 mhz and the voltage is reduced
 intel ne pratham penrin aadhaarit pentium dul-kor, T4200 disambar 2008 main jari kiya
 Later, mobile Pentium T4000, SU2000 and SU4000 processors based on Penryn were sold in the market as Pentium
 2010 ke aarambh main pentium dul-kor brands band ho chukaa he evam iskaa sthaan pentium naam ne le liya he
 The desktop E6000 series and oem-only mobile Pentium SU2000 and all later models were always called Pentiums, but processors with desktop Pentium dual-core E2000 and E5000 series had to be renamed
 yadhyapi pentium naam kaa upyog karte hue, desktop pentium dul-kor kor microarchitekchar par aadhaarit he, jise apane vishesh lakshan kii pentium d se tulana karne ke samay spasht rup se dekha ja saktaa he, jo sarvapratham pentium 4 main vyavhaar kiye gaye net barst microarchitekchar par aadhaarit he
 Shared L2-cache of 2 or 4 megabytes supported Core 2 Duo, the desktop Pentium dual-core has a shared L2 cache of 1 or 2 megabytes
 iske vipareet, pentium d processron main yaa to 2 yaa 4 mabibite kaa gaiyr saajha L2 cash hota he
 Additionally, the fastest speed clock Pentium d has a factory limit of 3
73 ghz, while the fastest speed clock desktop Pentium dual-core reaches 3
2 ghz
 in processron ke bich ek pramukh antar yah he ki desktop pentium dul-kor processron main keval 65 wat kaa thermal dizin power hota he jabaki pentium d main yah 95 se 130 wat ke bich hota he

 britain ne apane swaarthon kii raksha ke liye china main opium ke seven ko badhaava diya tha or is nashe main galiff chiniyon kaa bharpoor utpeedan kiya tha
 Therefore, it was but natural that resentment was growing in the minds of the patriotic Chinese against these oppressive circumstances

 samyavaadiyon ke is drushtikon se chini janata kaa bahumat unke saath ho gaya faltah samyavaadee ko apni shakti badhaane kaa mauka mila
 Chiang Kai-shek considered it more important to wipe out the Communists than to stop the Japanese, and so sent an army to Liaoning Shenxi province to fight with the Communists in 1936, but the Communists did not think it appropriate to fight their Chinese brothers and under Liang Sent the sent army with national consciousness and asked the Japanese to fight
 jab chyang kaai shaike ne samyavaadiyon ke daman kii hi baat kii tab liyang ne use bandi bana liya kintu samyavaadiyon ke hastkshep se antat vah mukt hua
 Therefore, in view of the desire of Chinese Lokmat, Chiang began negotiations with the Samvadis and entered into an agreement in 1937 to destroy Japan's dominance by making concerted efforts
 is samjhaute ke anusaar uttar-pashchimi china ke shensi or kangsu praant par samyavaadiyon ke shashan ko sweekaar kiya gaya or samyavaadee sena ko china kii rashtriya sena kaa ang maan liya gaya jise japan ke viruddh mahasenapati chyang kaai shaike ke adeshon kaa paalan karnaa tha

 Therefore, the situation of conflict between the Communists and the Kuomitang resurfaced
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke shuru ho jane se china-japan yuddh america-british nitiyon se prabhavit hone laga
 The United States and Britain transported millions of tons of war material by air to help Chiang Kai-shek's government so that the influence of Japan or Russia would not increase in China

 This agreement was concluded on 10 January 1946 with the efforts of Marshall

 Thus the communist revolution in China was successful
 chyang kaai shaike kii kuomitanga sarkaar formosa dweep main simat kar rah gai
 By not recognizing the communist government of China, the US recognized the nationalist government based in Formosa as the government of China and maintained its relationship
 vastutah samyavaadiyon or chyang kaai shaike ke bich sangharsh main america chaahate hue bhi chyang ko khulaa samarthan nahin de sakaa kyonki tab rus samyavaadiyon ke samarthan main aa jaataa
 In this case, there would have been a possibility of direct conflict between the us-russia
