 Punctuality may indicate the following: is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Wiki ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 Wiki is a website that enables the creation and editing of any number of interconnected web pages using wiki software, using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG text editor within the browser
 Wikis are often used to create collaborative websites, to speed up community websites, and for comments
 sahyogi vishwakosh vikipedia viki ke sabase achche gyaat udaahranon main se ek he
 Wikis are used in business to provide intranets and knowledge management systems
 ward kaningham, pratham viki software,vikivikiweb ke nirmaataa, shuru main iskaa varnan is prakaar kiya tha, "saralatam online database jo sambhawatah kaam kare
" "wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "fast"
 "viki" kaa vistaar is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he "wat ai no is", lekin yah bachronim he
 Wikiquiweb was the first site called wiki
 ward kaningham ne 1994 main vikivikiweb kaa vikaas karnaa shuru kiya or 25 march 1995 ko ise internet domen c2
com par sthapit kiya
 It was named by Cunningham, who is reminded of a counter employee at Honolulu International Airport who asked him to take the "wiki wiki" shuttle bus that runs between the airport terminals
 kaningham ke anusaar, "maine viki viki ko 'jaldi' ke ek parivartak sthanapann ke rup main chunaa, atah is cheez ke naam ko jaldi-web rakhane se parhez kiya
 " kaningham kuch had tak appal ke hypercard se bhi prerit the
 Apple designed a system that allowed users to create virtual "heaps of cards", supporting connections between different cards
 kaningham ne vanevar bush ke vichaar ko upyogkartaaon dwaara ek duusare ke paathon "par tipanni karne or unako parivartit karne" kii anumati pradaan karke kiya
 In the early 2000s, wikis were increasingly adopted as collaborative software in the enterprise
 Common uses included project communication, intranet and documentation, initially for technical users
 Today some companies use wikis as their only collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to promote collective learning

 Generally, there are no reviews before the amendments are accepted
 kai vikiz main aam janata apane upyogkarta khaaton ko register karwaae bina bhi parivartan kar sakati he
 Sometimes a session login is suggested, to create a "wiki signature" cookie for automatic signature on editing
 However, many edits can be made in real-time and appear almost instantly online
 yah pranali ke durupyog ko badhaava de saktaa he
 Private wiki servers also require authentication to edit and occasionally read pages
 vikiz main upyogkarta kai tareekon se saamagree ko sampadit kar sakate hai
 In general, the structure and formatting of wiki pages is specified in a simple markup language, sometimes called "wikitext"
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek pankti ko ek tarak ke saath shuru karne kaa prayog usko aksar ek bullated suchi main darj karne ke liye hota he
 The style and syntax of wikitext vary greatly, some of which also allow HTML tags
 is drushtikon ko rakhane kaa kaaran yah he ki achtmal, iske kai gudh tangon ke saath bahut suvachy nahin he isliye ise sampadit karnaa mushkil hota he
 So wikis favor simple text editing where there are fewer and easier rules for style and structure than HTML

 Access restricted to CSS provides uniformity in its view and by disabling javascript, the user can be prevented from implementing code, which may limit other users' access
 march khargosh ne bahut jor dekar elice se kaha, "kuch or chaay le lo"
 "I haven't done anything yet," Alice replied in a hurt tone: "so i can't take it anymore
" "tumhaara matlab he tum kam nahin le sakati ho," hatter ne kaha: "kuch nahin se zyada lenaa aasaan he
 " adhikadhik, vikiz "WWYSIWYG" sampadan ko upyogkartaaon ke liye uplabdh kara rahe hai, aamtaur par javascript yaa ek active eks niyantran ke madhyam se jo "bold" or "italex" jaise graphikali pravisht swarupan nirdeshon ko unke anukool HTML tag yaa vickytixt main anuvaadit kar dete hai
 In these, the markup of the newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and presented to the server in a transparent manner, the user avoiding these technical extensions
 haalanki, WYSIWYG niyantran vickytixt main uplabdh sabhi suvidhaon ko hameshaa pradaan nahin karte hai
 Most wikis keep records of changes made to pages; Often all versions of the page are stored
 iskaa matlab he ki lekhak prishth ke puraane sanskaran par ja sakate hai, yadi yah aavashyak ho jaye kyonki koi galati kar di gayi he athwa prishth se chhedchhad kii gayi he
 Many implementations allow users to supply an "edit summary" when editing a page
 yah parivartanon ke saransh kaa ek laghu paath hota he 
yah lekh main nahin daalaa jaataa he, balki ye sanshodhan ke saath sangruhit hota he, upyogkartaaon ko yah samajhane kaa mauka detaa he ki kya or kyon kiya gaya he; yah ek log sandesh ke samaan he jab ek sanshodhan niyantran pranali main parivartan kiya jaataa he
 There are usually a large number of hypertext links within most pages to go to other pages
 sanrachit / aupchaarik nevigation yojanaon kii tulana main nevigation kaa yah gaiyr-raikhik prakaar viki ke liye zyada "sthaneey" he
 Users can create indexes or tables of hierarchical classification or any type of page content of the organization as they wish
 inako haath se banaae rakhana chunauteepurn ho saktaa he, kyonki kai lekhak tadarth tareeke se prishthon ko banaate or nasht karte rahete hai
 To maintain such index pages, wikis typically provide one or more ways to classify and tag pages
 adhikansh vikiz main bekalink visheshta hoti he, jo pradipt prishth se jude sabhi prishthon ko darshata he
 Creating pages that do not yet exist is a feature of the wiki
 iske dwaara viki nae vishyon par dusron ko apane vichaar prakat karne ke liye aamantrit karata he
 Links are created by the use of a specific syntax, the so-called "link pattern"
 In the beginning, most wikis used camelcase to name pages and create links
 inako kisi vaakya main shabdon ko bade aksharon main likhakar or unke bich ke rikt sthanon ko hataakar banaaya jaataa he 
 jahaan ek ore kamelkase liking ko bahut aasaan banaata he, yah un links main bhi sahaayta karata he jo aise rup main likhe gayi he jo maanak vartanee se vyutpann hua he
 camelcase-based wikis are recognized instantly because they contain many links with names such as "beginnerquestions" and "tableofcontents"
 viki main dikhaai dene vaale shabdon ko sundar banane ke liye unke bich rikt sthanon ko punah daal dena sambhav he or sambhawatah chote shabdon main bhi likhaa ja saktaa he
 However, this retransmission of the link to improve reading is limited by the loss of information on large words caused by camelcase reversal
 udhaaharan ke liye, "richardwagner" ko "richard Wagner" ke rup main dikhnaa chahie, jabaki "popularmusic" ko "popular music" ke rup main dikhnaa chahie
 yah pataa lagane kaa koi aasaan tarika nahin he ki kin bade shabdon ko bada hi rahanaa chahie
 parinamswaroop, kai vikiz main ab koshthak kaa upyog karne vaali "mukt kadiyaan" hai or kuch main to pehle se hi camelcase niskriy hota he
 Most wiki communities are private, especially within enterprises
 They are often used as internal documentation for internal systems and applications
 vikinodes viki par maujuud vah prishth hai jo sambandhit vikiyon kaa varnan karte hai
 They are usually organized as neighbors and representatives
 ek padosi viki vah viki he jo samaan saamagree par charchaa kar sakati he yaa anya kisi prakaar se dilachasp ho sakati he
 a representative wiki is a wiki that agrees to assign certain content to itself
 ek vishisht vishay par ek viki ko khojane kaa ek tarika yah he ki viki se viki tak viki-node network kaa anusaran kiya jaye; doosraa tarika he ek viki "bas yatra" karnaa, udhaaharan ke liye: Wikipedia's Tour Bus Stop "viki" yukt domen naamon kii lokapriyata main vruddhi ho rahi he, vishisht chizon ke samarth hetu
 For those who wish to create their own wiki, there are publicly available "wiki farms", some of which can also create private and password protected wikis
 pbwiki, Socialtext, Wetpaint or Wikia aisi sevaaon ke lokapriy udhaaharan hai
 For more information, see the list of wiki farms
 Note that free wiki farms usually include advertisements on every page

 hajaargi main 'boot' kaha jaataa he jabaki yahi shabd farsi main 'boot' uccharit hota he

 i believe that one day the school will open but on the way to leaving i saw the school building as if i will never come here again
 ' Malala has received numerous threats since the time she began writing about the excesses of the Taliban in blogs and media

 Its pioneer is somewhat predecessor to Mammatt, the author of Kaviprakash

 Both acharyas have given importance to doshava and quality in poetry
 bhojdev kii yah visheshta he ki unhone alankaaron kii upadayeta kanthat: sweekaar kii he tathaa kavy ke liye rasanvit hona aavashyak samajha he
 Thus, Bhojdev's Saraswati Kantha Bharan has influenced Mammat and Vishwanath in part
 saraswatikanthabharan ek dirghakaay granth he jisamen paanch pariched hai
 In the first passage, after giving the definition of poetry general, the author has first discussed the long and virtue of poetry
 isi sandarbh main bhojdev ne pad, vaakya evam vaakyarthgat dosha bataae hai
 The number of defects of each type is sixteen
 bhojdev ke anusaar gun, shabdagat or vaakyarth gat hote hai or prayek ke choubees bhed hai
 At the end of the first passage, certain defects become attributes somewhere
 is kavyatatv ko udhaaharan dwaara samajhaate hue unhone kavyadosha kaa nityanityatv sweekrut kiya he
 In the second passage, while deciding on the phraseology, he first emphasized justification and has given a thoughtful explanation of caste, ritual, attitude, shadow, posture, utterance, tact, bhuniti, hump, bed and readiness
 in baarah tatwon main se reeti ko chhod shesh tatwon kaa vishad vivechan sanskrit ke kisi anya uplabdh sahityagranth main praapt nahin hota
 Banabhatta mentions the bed of special poetic element, but its definition is available only in Saraswati Kantabharana
 tatpashchaat, yamak, shlesh, anupras, chitra, prahelika, gudh evam prashnottar alankaaron ke bhuri bhedopabhedon kaa sodaaharan vivaran diya gaya he
 This part also has the most personal feature of Saraswati Kantabharan
 tadnantar bhojdev kavyavyutpatti ke kaarnon kaa vivechan kar kavy ke teen bhedon ko shravy, drishy evam chitrabhinay ke rup main prastut karte hai
 He has not mentioned Darsuparchakas under visualization, but his division on dance and dance is limited
 tisare pariched main arthanlakaaron ke swaroop evam prakaar bhed kaa vivechan he jo itar saahityachaaryon kii apeksha bhinn swaroop ko liye hue he
 In the fourth passage, there is a discussion of bisexuality, in which the distinction of ornaments of upma etc
 is explained in detail
 antim pariched he - rasvivechan
 In it, the character of Naikadi and the expressions, emotions and experiences have been decided in detail; At the same time, there is also a reference to the form of Kavyapaka, the diverse nightlife
 ant main bharti, kaishiki aadi vrittiyon ke vivechan ke saath granthopasanhaar hota he
 Rasasiddhanta's explanation in Saraswati Kantabharana is often a bird's eye view of the subject
 kavyagat ras gambhir vishay he jisaki garima ke saath purnat: nyaay karne kii drushti se bhoj ne ek shringarprakash naamak swatantra granth kii rachana kar rasvivechan ke adhyay kii purti kii he
 The specialty of Saraswati Kantha Bharan is that it is a broader and derivative text than other literary texts
 iske rachayita bhojdev granthvistaar ke bhay se bhit honevaale nahin hai, udhaaharan de-dekar anek sookshm bhed evam upabhedon ko samajhane kaa sadaa ve udaar prayaas karte hai
 Although the recognition of the discrimination presented by them has not been accepted by the later writers, yet the persistence of disagreeing with their elemental deliberations is also not visible
 is granth par adyopant kisi tikaa kii rachana nahin milti
 On the first three passages, there is a vaccine called Ratneshwar Ramsinghrit Darpan Tika and on the fourth passage, the description of the famous commentator Jagadghar, is not the vaccine for the fifth passage

 Vande Mataram bankimachandra chattopadhyaay dwaara sanskrit bangla mishrit bhashaa main rachit is geet kaa prakaashan san 1882 main unke upanyaas anand math main anternihit geet ke rup main hua tha
 In this novel, this song is sung by a monk named Bhawanand
 isaki dhun yadunath bhattacharya ne banaayi thi
 In 2003, in an international survey conducted by BBC World Service, in which around 7,000 songs were selected from around the world to select the ten most famous songs of the time, and according to BBC, people from 155 countries / islands had it
 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 Initially, only two of its verses were composed, which were in Sanskrit
 in donon padon main keval mathrubhumi kii vandana thi
 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland
 yah upanyaas angreji shashan, jameendaaron ke shoshan va prakritik prakope main mar rahi janata ko jaagrit karnehetu achaanak uth khadey hue sanyasi vidroh par aadhaarit tha
 This factual history was mentioned by Bankim Babu himself in the third edition of 'anand Math'

 In the novel, this song is sung by a monk rebel named Bhawanand

 "the verse after Mukhade is also in Sanskrit:" Shubhra Jyotsnaam Pulkit Yaminim, Ful Kusumit Drumdal Shobhinim; Suhasiniin Sumadhur Bhasheenam, Sukhaand Varadaan Mataram
 " kintu upanyaas main is geet ke aage jo pad likhe gayi the ve upanyaas kii mul bhashaa arthath bangla main hi the
 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga
 yah geet ravivaar, karthik sudi navami, shake 1797 ko puraa hua
 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896
 paanch saal baad yani san 1901 main kalakatta main hue ek anya adhiveshan main shri charandas ne yah geet punah gaaya
 The song was given by Sarladevi Chaudharani at the Banaras session of 1905

 Lala Lajpat Rai started the publication of the journal from Lahore named Vande Mataram
 angrejon kii goli kaa shikaar banakar dam todanevaali aazaadee kii divaani maatangini haajra kii jubaan par aakhri shabd "vande maataram" hi the
 In 1907, when Madame Bhikhaji Cama hoisted the tricolor in Stuttgart, Germany, "vande Mataram" was written in the middle of it
 arya printing press, lahore tathaa bhartiya press, dehradun se san 1929 main prakashit kakori ke shahid pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' kii pratibandhit pustak "kranti gitanjali" main pehla geet "matra-vandana" vande maataram hi tha jisamen unhone keval is geet ke do hi pad diye the or uske baad is geet kii prashasti main vande maataram sheershak se ek swarchit urdu ghazal di thi jo us kalkhand ke asankhya anaam hutatmaon kii aawaaj ko abhivyakti detii he
 Restricted in the British period, this book is now edited and available in libraries
 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved
 swatantrata prapti ke baad dow rajendra prasad ne samvidhan sabha main 24 janvari 1950 main 'vande maataram' ko raashtragit ke rup main apnaane sambandhi vaktavy padhaa jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

asp Zarathushtra, Zarathushtra is believed to be the founder of the Persian Zoroastrianism of ancient Iran known to the inhabitants of ancient Greece and Western writers as its Greek form Jarostar
 farsi main zaradustra: gujarati tathaa anya bhartiya bhashaaon main zarathusht
 Historians differ about his birth and death
 unke jivan kaal kaa anumaan vibhinn vidwaanon dwaara 1400 se 600 ipu he
 Was the messenger of Zarathushtra
 unhone sarvapratham daaevon kii ninda kii or ahura mazda ko ek, akelaa or sachcha ishwar mana
 He started a new religion "zarathushtri Dharma" and wrote several earlier episodes in the Parsi scripture Avesta
 sabase pehle shuddh advaitvaad ke prachaarak joroastria dharm ne yahudee dharm ko prabhavit kiya or uske dwaara isai or islam dharm ko
 This religion once influenced the territories across the Himalayas and Greek and Roman thought and philosophy, but it was replaced by the religion of Islam around 600 years ad
 yadhyapi apane udbhavsthaan aadhunik iran main yah dharm vastut: samaapt he, pracheen joroastrianon ke mutthibhar bache khuche logon ke atirikt, jo vivashtaaon ke baavjood iran main rahe or unke vanshajon ke atirikt jo apane dharm ko bachaane ke liye baarah shatabdiyon se adhik hua purv bharat bhaag aae the, unamem us mahaan prabhu kii vaani ab bhi jivit he or aaj tak unke gharon or upasnagrihon main suni jaati he
 In the form of songs, his sermons are protected by the name of Gatha, which is praised by good thoughts, good speech, good deeds
 rajvansh se acchhee tarah sambhddha suramaaon ke spitma kabeeley main zarathustra kaa janm hua
 According to a tradition mentioned by Pliny in Natural History, he was the only human who laughed on the day of birth
 uske janm ke samay majdayasani dharm vikrut hua
 Superstition had replaced true knowledge
 ishwar par jhuthe devataaon ne akraman kar diya
 So, at the age of fifteen, Zarathushtra took disinterest from the world and spent seven years in solitude to seriously meditate on the mystery of human existence
 jab divya drushti kii laalasaa ne anya sari ichchhaaon kaa naash kar diya, tab divya shaktiyon main se vohu mahah unki dhyanavastha main prakat hue or unki samadhisth aatma ko ahur majd ke samaksh upasthit kiya
 Hey Mazd, when i first imagined you in my meditation, i considered you the world's first actor with pure heart, the father of conscience, the creator of virtue, the regulator of human actions
 praarambhik kathinaaiyon ke baad unke mat ko raja vishtsp ne sweekaar kiya or vah teji se failane laga
 He preached religion till the last day of his life by teaching every woman and man to gather around the spirit for fifty years and destroy the powers of evil
 unamem duusare dharmon ke prati ashishnutaa nahin thi
 The conclusion of this view is the sublime sense of the rules of "fraction"
 sadachaar to "ansh" shabd kii aspasht vyakhya maatr he jo vyavastha, sangati, anushaasan, ekarupata kaa suchak he or sab prakaar kii pavitrataa, satyashiltaa or paroapkaar ke sabh roopon or kriy xxrep 4 a n ko sametati he
 While praising God in front of people, Pangbar told them that do not blindly accept any opinion, accept or reject it with the help of conscience
 yah vilakshan baat he
 Those who are able to hear the words of "wohoo mah" and act accordingly, they attain health and immortality
 bhavi jivan kii is kalpana se mrityu ke baad jivan kaa vichaar utpann hua jisaki shiksha puraani pothee ke antim bhaag main di gai he
 European writers have termed Zarathushtra's doctrine as duality, because of the mess of ideas and the misconception of opposition to Sad and Asad in the process of well-thought philosophy of the Mahatma
 is prakaar kii kalpana ne aavesta siddhant ke mul tatwon ko hi nazarandaaj kar diya he
 Research by European and Zoroastrian scholars has now definitively attested that Zarathushtra's philosophy rests on pure monotheism and that the mention of the personification of the deity is nothing but pure metaphorical mention
 kintu isamen ajorushtriya lekhakon kaa utana dosha nahin he jitna ki parvartiya yug ke joroshtriyanon kaa he jo swayan apane paigambar kii vaastavik shikshaaon ko bhul gaye the, jinhone darshan ko aadhyatm se milaane kii gadabad kii or ahur majd ke samakaksh or samakaleen duratma ke astitv ke vishwaas ko janm diya
 Known as Kannur Fort in Kerala, this fort was built in 1505 AD by Don Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy

 vaakar white house ke interkam ke jariye kel se savyar ko unke hawaale karne ko kahata he anyathaa stenz ke haathon emily maar di jaaygi
 Savior eventually surrenders himself to Emily, and Walker reveals the secret of his original plan: to launch nuclear missiles into various cities of Iran, like a football game, as a result of which many countries will retaliate and the Third World War begins

 At the same time, Fellarty's call tells Kell that Walker had not called those murderers, perhaps someone else would be the conspirator of this attack

 Here the progress made in the field of microscopes since 1865 AD is being mentioned here: ekal uttal lens, jise saadhaarant: aavardhan lens kehete hai, saralatam sookshmdarshi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is also called 'JB microscope'

 It is impossible to see an atom or molecule only with our eyes because there is a limitation of our eyes seeing microscopic objects
 yah seemaa upkaran kii apurnataa ke kaaran hi nahin parantu prakaash tarangon kii prakruti ke kaaran bhi he jinke prati hamaari aankh samvedansheel he
 If we want to see metals, our biologists have to develop a new type of eye that will receive waves that are thousands of times smaller than the waves that our current normal eyes, or astrology, can perceive

 In this way it limits their disillusionment
 ise vibhedan kii seemaa kehete hai
 In mathematics it is expressed by the following relation

 yahan u vastu duuri kaa apvartanaank he
 q is the angle that the rim ray makes along the optical axis
 is prakaar drushti vikiran kaa vichaar karne se alpatam vibhedan duuri 3000 A° ke lagbhag hoti he
 For the smallest ultraviolet and infrared rays, this limit will be around 1500 a ° and 3850 a °, respectively, where 1 a ° = 10-8 cm
 aaie ham apane ko purv ke sookshmdarshikivid ke rup main sochen or un sudhaaron par vichaar karen jo ham us samay karnaa chaahate the
 Generally, we focus our hopes on four things: uparyukt sudhaar yaa kathinaaiyon kaa vastu kii prakruti, pradipti ke prakaar or photography takneekee ne san 1895 main eks kiran kaa avishkaar kiya
 But until 1912, there was no idea of the wave nature of the x ray until Van Lauey proved it
 ab yah aashaa hui ki eks-re sookshmdarshi banaaya ja saktaa he
 So this idea was abandoned at that time

 Now let us look at general visible light microscopy
 iske purv ki ham us disha main hua pragati par vichaar-vimarsh kare, hamen un aakankshaon par dhyaan rakhana hoga jo 40 varsh purv sookshmdarshikividon kii thi
 It was not possible to fulfill all the requirements with a single device

 There is also a limit to the increase of the magnification capacity of the system
 yah prayukt leson kii focus duriyon kaa falan he
 Magnification is the inverse function of the focus distance, so the lack of focus distance leads to magnification
 par saath hi kriyaatmak duuri nasht ho jaati he
 Because of such ideas, Birch built reflective microscopes in 1947 in Bristol using mirrors in place of lenses
 siddhantat: parabangnee kiran tak vikiran kaa upyog yahan sambhav ho sakaa
 It has a lower numeric gateway but has the advantage of greater achromaticity and greater functional distance
 chunki quartz 2000 A° tak vikiran kaa avasorana nahin karata isliye us sookshmdarshi se jisamen kwatarj lenson kaa upyog hota he, kam se kam vibhedan duuri 1,000 A° praapt hogi at: is prakaar ke vinyas ke saath parabangnee vikiran ke upyog se 'parabangnee sookshmdarshi' kaa nirmaan hota he
 If an ordinary light microscope is used to collect radiation scattered by small objects, this type of arrangement is called a microscope
 pro jernik ne sookshmdarshi main kala vaishamy pradipti kaa upyog kiya
 This technology was called art contrast microscope
 yah rangahin visheshat: paardarshak padaarthon kii sanrachana dikhaane kii vidhi he
 Differentiation is seen in them due to different structures, such as in the frog's liver
 vaishamy ko sudhaarney ke liye jaivikivid ranjakon kii sahaayta lete hai
 This is usually done with contrasting color filters
 dhruvit prakaash se kuch hi kism ke crystalon kaa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he par kalavaishamy se sab prakaar ke crystalon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique does not use artificial colors as a stain

 The advantage of art-contrast method is that illumination, which is required in every microscope, does not require anything else to see the organism
 kala vaishamy sookshmdarshi main sookshmdarshi saamaanya kism kaa hi rahata he
 There is only this novelty that a new light device is added

 The expressed expression thus expresses the refractive index structure of the finge object
 vastut: do prakaar kii yah pradipti dhundli prishthbhumi or kalavaishamy maanav ke liye ek bada mahatv kaa saadhan he
 The blurred background illumination has proven useful in observing extremely fine particles, and art contrast illumination has increased the technical possibility of knowing the minimum change in optical density so that reflection can be easily explained
 ham dekhte hai ki chalis varsh purv ke sookshmdarshividon kii anek aakankshaayen puri ho gai hai
 This is not the end here because there is no end of research and the same is for microscopy and efforts are still being made to increase the above limit of differentiation capacity of magnification capacity
