 Pleased with his penance, Lord Shankar told him, o Rajan! You have worshiped me by wishing for a son

 Saying this, Lord Shankar disappeared

 Kalachakra passed and Asmanj's son named Anshuman was born
 asamanj atyant dusht prakruti kaa tha isaliye raja sagar ne use apane desh se nishkasit kar diya
 Then once King Sagar took initiation to perform Ashwamedha Yajna
 ashwamegh yajna kaa shyamakarna ghoda chhod diya gaya or uske peeche-peeche raja sagar ke saath hajaar putr apni vishaal sena ke saath chalane lage
 Fearing this Ashwamedha Yagna of Sagar, Devraj Indra, having the opportunity, stole the horse and took it away and tied it in Kapil Muni's ashram
 us samay kapil muni dhyaan main leen the atah unhen is baat kaa pataa hi na chalaa
 Here, sixty thousand sons of Sagar searched the horse at every place of the earth, but could not find it
 ve ghode ko khojate huye prithvi ko khod kar pataal lok tak pahunch gayi jahaan apane ashram main kapil muni tapasya kar rahe the or vahiin par vah ghoda bandhaa hua tha
 The sons of Sagara, realizing that the horse had stolen Kapil Muni, started narrating the sarcasm to Kapil Muni
 apane niraadar se kupit hokar kapil muni ne raja sagar ke saath hajaar putron ko apane krodhagni se bhasma kar diya
 "when Sagar got the news of his sixty thousand sons being consumed by Narada Muni, he called his grandson Anshuman and said," Son! Your sixty thousand grandfathers had to be consumed in the wrath of Kapil Muni because of me
 " ab tum kapil muni ke ashram main jaakar unase kshamaprarthana karke us ghode ko le aao
 Anshuman walked the path made by his grandfathers and reached Kapil Muni's ashram
 vahaan pahunch kar unhone apni prarthana evam mridu vyavhaar se kapil muni ko prasann kar liya
 Kapil Muni was pleased and asked her to ask for the groom
 anshuman bole ki mune! krupa karke hamaara ashv lautaa den or hamaare dadaon ke uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataayen
 Kapil Muni returning the horse said that Watts! When your grandfathers can be saved only by offering them with the water of the Ganges
 "anshuman ne yajna kaa ashv laakar sagar kaa ashwamegh yajna purna kara diya
 On completion of the yajna, King Sagar went to Uttarakhand to do penance for the purpose of bringing Ganga from heaven to earth by handing over the kingdom to Anshuman, thus he went to heaven while doing penance
 anshuman ke putr kaa naam dilip tha
 When Dileep got older, Anshuman also handed over the kingdom to Dilip and went to Uttarakhand to do penance for the purpose of bringing Ganga from heaven to earth, but he too could not succeed in bringing Ganga from heaven to earth
 dilip ke putr kaa naam bhageerath tha
 After Bhagiratha grew up, Dilip too followed his ancestors, but he too failed to bring Ganga
 "antatah bhageerath kii tapasya se ganga prasann huin or unase vardaan maangane ke liya kaha
 Bhagirath folded his hands and said that mother! For the salvation of my sixty thousand forefathers, please you descend on earth

 That is why you please Lord Shankar first

 Different elements of cow dung bind soil particles by coming in contact with soil, but if these particles are very close to each other or attached then they remove them away, which causes air to enter the soil
 And the roots of plants breathe easily into it
 gobar kaa samuchit laabh khaad ke rup main hi prayog karke paaya ja saktaa he
 As just stated, the most beneficial use of cow dung may be in the form of manure, but due to the lack of burning wood in India, it is used more as fuel
 eendhan ke liye iske gohare yaa conde banaakar sukha liye jate hai
 Dried goats burn well and the food made on them, due to cooking on a sweet flame, is delicious
 kintu gobar kaa uchit evam laabhprad upyog, jaisaa kaha ja chukaa he, khaad ke rup main hi he
 In all rich countries, wherever there are dung animals, manure is made from cow dung and fields are made fertile
 bharat main pehle gobar se khaad banane kii do vidhiyaan prachlit thim, kintu ek teesri vidhi bhi ab prachlit kii ja rahi he
 These methods are as follows: iske liye uchit aakaar ke gadhe, 20-25 foot lambey, 5-6 foot chaude tathaa 3 se lekar 10 foot gahare, khode jate hai or inamen gobar bhar diya jaataa he
 While filling, press it in such a way that no space is left vacant
 gadhe kaa upree bhaag gumbad kii tarah bana lete hai or gobar hi se use lep lete hai, jisase varsha ritu kaa anaavashyak jal usamen ghusane na paae
 After that, leave the fertilizer to be made for about three months
 is vidhi main gadhe kaa taap kabhi 34 degree se upar nahin ja paata, kyonki gadhe main rasinic kriyaayein hawa ke abhaav main simit rahati hai
 In this method, nitrogenous materials are not allowed to come out of the compost
 is vidhi main gobar kii ek patali tah bina dabaae daal di jaati he
 Chemical changes occur in the presence of air, causing the temperature to be 60 ° C
 Is reached
 tah ko phir dabaa diya jaataa he or duusari patali tah us par daal di jaati he jiske taap badhane diya jaataa he
 In this way the pile becomes ten to twenty feet high, which is left in this state for a few months
 is reeti se vishesh laabh yah hota he ki taap badhane par ghaas, mote aadi hanikar paudhon ke beej, jo gobar main upasthit rah sakate hai, nasht ho jate hai
 Thus 5 to 6 tons of manure can be made from each animal
 bhartiya krishi anusandhan centre dwaara viksit kii gai is vidhi main ek saadhaaran yantra kaa upyog hota he, jisamen gobar kaa pachan hawa kii anupasthiti main hota
 This method produces a type of gas, which serves as a fuel for lighting, operating machinery and cooking food
 gobar pani kaa mishran kar pachak-yantra main prati din daalate jate hai or nikalne vaali gas se uparokt kaam lete hai
 The specialty of this method is that cow dung is obtained in the form of odorless manure and its useful elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potash etc
 remain safe without being destroyed
 saath saath isse upyogi gas bhi mil jaati he
 It is estimated that a village family, consisting of 4-5 animals, can produce about 70–75 cubic feet of burning gas per day
 bharat main kuch gobar kii maatra or usamen upasthit nitrogen phosphorus evam potash kaa vaarshik utpaadan is prakaar he: But only a small part of cow dung is used as fertilizer
 isi kaaran is desh kaa utpaadan duusare deshon ke anupaat bahut kam he
 The use of cow dung as firewood is to destroy a valuable manure
 nasht karnaa he
 As far as possible dung should be used for manure only

 sataha ko dekh kar bahut se vaigyanikon ko lagata he ke uske neeche zarur ek pani kaa samudr hoga
 Their thinking is that whenever the surface bursts due to a meteorite falling or it cracks due to the pull of Jupiter's tidal force, the hot ice that contacts the ocean water from below comes up and tightly heals the wound
 is
 agar vastav main aisa samudr he to sambhav he ke usamen jivan punap rahaa ho
 Due to this possibility, the Space Exploration Agencies of Europe and America are planning to do more research on Europa
 vaigyanik yah bhi anumaan lagate hai ke europa kii sakht barfili sataha arabon saal pehle hue apane nirmaan ke baad 80° gum chuki he
 This gives rise to the suspicion that the superficial ice shell is floating above a water sphere and can move freely
 anya vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ke aisa koi samudr nahin he or baahar kii sakht barf ke neeche keval naram barf he - lekin aisa vishwaas rakhane vaale vaigyanik alp sankhya main hai

 Because scientists believe that the surface of the upper ice is more than 10 km thick, this vehicle will have to be sunk very deep to reach the sea
 yah bhi aavashyak hoga ke isaki prasaaran shakti bahut ho taaki barf kii itani gaharaai ke neeche se bhi vah sandesh or tasviren bhej sake
 This vehicle will also have such ability that it can roam in the ocean itself and can choose its direction because it will take few minutes to reach the directions from the earth

 anglo-ayeri literature refers to the literature created by English-speaking Irishmen, which has a special imprint of the personal civilization, culture and nature of the Eyre
 galic apane astitv ke liye 17veen shatabdi tak sangharsh karti rahi or swatantra hone ke baad ir ne use apni rashtrabhasha mana
 Yet the foreign medium through which the Irishmen have expressed themselves for nearly four hundred years is their own national property as ancestral right

 Among the authors of this literature we find three types of people: one who migrated from England and settled in Eyre, but remained a full Englishman by his rites, and the other who settled in England after coming from Eyre and who forgot their national rites They adopted the English rites, the third those who were originally English or whether they came to Ayri, but who had created literature by integrating themselves with the soul of Eyre
 mukhyat: is teesri shrenee ke log hi aangl-yri sahitya ko vah vishistataa pradaan karte hai jisase bhashaa kii ekta ke baavjood angreji sahitya main usko alag sthaan diya jaataa he
 This peculiarity lies in his musicality, emotionality, symbolism, fictionality, faith in superman and superfluity, and sometimes the most alienated of all, in an intellectual and rationalism that seems to be rhetorical and revolutionary

 Category socialism is a political movement that favors workers' control over industries
 iskaa janm united kingdom main hua tathaa beesvin shatabdi ke pratham chaturthaansh main sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee rahaa
 This movement was strongly associated with CDH Cole and influenced by the ideas of William Morris
 shrenee samaajwaad shram samaajwaad or rajya samaajwaad kaa samanvay mana ja saktaa he
 Like the Labor Socialists, the 'category Socialists' condemned the state control over bureaucracy and industries and, like the 'state Socialists', considered the State as an instrument of political organization and control

 Category socialism accepts social ownership and supports industrial autonomy
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar aise raajnneetik loktantr kaa koi arth nahin jisamen udyogon kaa niyantran nirankushta ke aadhaar par hota he
 Famous scholar of political science Shri G
 DH Cole explained it as follows: shrenee samaajwaad raajnneetik tathaa prashaskeey maamalon ko audyogic tathaa aarthik maamalon se pruthak rakhane ke paksh main he
 a committee was envisaged above political officials and labor officers in which both should have representatives
 yahi sammilit samiti sabhi vivadagrast prashnon par antim nirnay degi
 Opponents of this ideology thus consider it impossible to divide politics and economic affairs

 Regardless of the form of the state, not all categories of socialists were unanimous on the answer

 In fact, the aim of the category socialists was the re-establishment of medieval categories by economic decentralization and solution to labor problems

 The term chemotherapy is made up of two words - chemical means chemotherapy and therapy
 ksi ko kis prakaar kii chemotherapy di jaae, iskaa nirnay is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki aapako kis prakaar kaa cancer he
 Chemotherapy may also be given alone or with surgery or radiotherapy
 chemotherapy anek tareekon se di ja sakati he, ise dene kii sabase aam vidhiyaan hai- Depending on your treatment, it can be given at various intervals, such as daily, weekly, every two / three weeks or continuously
 chemotherapy ke phaayde is baat par nirbhar karte hai ki aapako kis prakaar kaa cancer he or vah kitna bad chukaa he
 The objectives of chemotherapy include the following: chemotherapy upachaar ke anek sambhavit dushprinaam hai
 These side effects will depend on the type of chemotherapy suggested to you
 mukhyatah rakt koshikaayen teen prakaar kii hoti hai, jo is prakaar hai- Your blood cell count may decrease with chemotherapy treatment
 isliye aapke rakt kii jaanch niyamit taur par kii jaaegi
 The number of white cells, red cells and platelets will be seen in these investigations
 yadi chemotherapy upachaar dwaara aapaki safed koshikaayen ghat gai hai, to aapkesharir main sankraman se ladne kii kshamta kam ho jaaegi
 One way to know if you have an infection is to increase your body temperature
 yadi aapke sharir kaa taapmaana 37
5 degree celsius yaa usase adhik he, athwa aapako gale main ghaav hone, khaansee, zukam yaa dast jaise sankraman ke koi bhi lakshan najar aate hai, to aapako turant doctor se sampark karnaa chahie
 If you have very few white blood cells, your treatment may need to be postponed for some time
 ye koshikaayen sharir ke sabhi angon tak oxigen pahunchaati hai
 If these are reduced, you may experience fatigue and yellowing, which is known as blood deficiency
 yadi aapaki laal koshikaayen saamaanya str se neeche hai, to aapako khun chadhvane kii jarurat pad sakati he
 These cells bind the blood flow, for example, when one of your organs is cut a little, then these cells bind the blood flow
 yadi chemotherapy ke kaaran aapaki platelets bahut kam ho gai hai to aap dekhge ki aapako aasaani se kharonchen lag jaati hai, athwa aapaki naak yaa masoodon se khun bahata he
 If your platelets numbers are below normal levels, you may need to mount platelets, otherwise we may have to postpone your treatment for some time
 cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht karne ke saath-saath chemotherapy upachaar aapke munh ke andar kii koshikaon ko bhi nasht kar saktaa he
 This can make your mouth red and you may feel a wound and discomfort in the mouth, as well as increase the chances of getting an infection in your mouth
 isliye yah jaruri he ki aap upachaar ke dauraan apane munh kaa vishesh rup se dhyaan rakhen
 You should keep your mouth as clean as possible
 har baar khaanaa khaane ke baad ek mulaayam datun or fluoride yukt manjan se apane daant saaf karen
 If you have a wound in your gums, use the powder used for sensitive teeth
 masoodon se shuru karte hue neeche kii ore brush karte hue apane daanton ko komalta se saaf karen
 If you do not have many wounds on your tongue, then you should also clean your tongue softly
 yadi aap nakli daant lagaate hai, to aapako unhen din main do baar saaf karnaa chahie or khaane ke baad acchhee tarah dhonaa chahie
 They should be soaked in water overnight and you should use a bactericidal solution once a week to disinfect them
 apane munh ko taazgi dene or nam rakhane ke liye adhik se adhik maatra main drav padaarth pien
 Cleaning your mouth with salt water can also be beneficial for you
 yadi aapako namak kaa prayog karnaa pasand nahin he to aap taaje pani se bhi aisa kar sakate hai
 If you have a wound in your mouth, a boil or a mouth ulcer, then you should inform your doctor directly
 vah aapako koi aisa upaay bataa saktaa he jisase aapako dard se raahat mil sake
 Sometimes chemotherapy treatment can affect your appetite

 If you need any kind of advice about eating and drinking during your chemotherapy treatment, you can ask your doctor or nurse to refer you to a dietician
 aapkaa swaad badal saktaa he, par praayah upachaar puraa hone ke do se teen maheenon ke bheetar vah phir se saamaanya ho jaataa he
 Chemotherapy treatment can sometimes cause nausea and / or vomiting
 kuch chemotherapy upachaaron dwaara anya kii tulana main michali aane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 However, vomiting is an uncommon thing nowadays because you will be given medicines to relieve nausea which are often very effective
 kuch chemotherapy upachaar aapaki aanton par prabhaav daal sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye chemotherapy kii kuch aushadhiyon se dast or kuch se kabj kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 Only a small number of chemotherapy drugs cause diarrhea and if you are being given any of these medicines, you will be given specific advice
 phir bhi, yadi aapako in donon main se koi bhi pareshaani ho to kripaya apane doctor yaa nurse ko isaki jaankaree den kyonki aamtaur dawaaon dwaara yaa aapke aahaar main parivartan karke inkaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Some chemotherapy drugs can cause hair thinning, or unfortunately in some cases complete hair loss may occur
 yah samasya hameshaa asthai hoti he or aapkaa chemotherapy upachaar puraa hone par aapke bal punah waapas aa jaaenge
 Scalp cooling can be used for some types of chemotherapy treatments to reduce hair loss
 aisi koi vajah nahin he ki sambhog se parhez kiya jaae, lekin ham condom istemaal karne kii salaah dete hai
 It is possible that some part of the chemotherapy is in the fluid coming out of your body, so in this case the use of condoms will protect your partner
 yah jaruri he ki apane upachaar ke dauraan athwa upachaar ke baad kam se kam chah maheene tak aap garbhadhaaran na karen yaa yadi aap purush hai to apane saathi ko garbhvatee hone den
 The reason for this is that chemotherapy can be harmful for the child
 kuch chemotherapy upachaar aapaki janankshmata par pratikul prabhaav daal sakate hai
 This problem can be temporary as well as permanent
 chemotherapy kii kuch aushadhiyaan aapaki twachaa ko dhoop ke prati or adhik samvedansheel bana sakati hai
 If you are being given any of these medicines, then you will be asked to take some special precautions
 isamen shaamil hai dhoop main rahane kaa samay kam karnaa, jahaan kahin sambhav ho vahaan chaaya main rahanaa, hat pahananaa or dhoop se bachaav karne vaali hai factor kriim kaa istemaal karnaa
 Chemotherapy can make you feel more tired than you usually do
 yah jaruri he ki aap apane sharir kii jarurat kaa dhyaan rakhen or yadi aapako aaraam kii jarurat ho to aaraam karen, lekin yadi aapako lagata he ki aap saamaanya rup se kaamkaaj karne main sakasham hai to aisa jarur karen
 Some people find it beneficial to do light exercise as well as rest
 chemotherapy kii kuch aushadhiyaan, jo drip main yaa sui dwaara di jaati hai, agar aapaki nas ke baahar ris jaaen to twachaa or uske aas-paas ke kshetra ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati hai
 This happens only in very rare situations, but it is important that you inform your nurse immediately about the place where you feel a drip, if you feel pain or irritation there
 aapke upachaar ke kai dinon baad tak aapke sharir ke drav padaarthon main kuch ansh main chemotherapy ke tatv maujuud ho sakate he
 Although the risk of harm from this is very low, it is important that others are exposed to chemotherapy
 isliye hamaari yah salaah he ki aap toilet kaa istemaal karne ke turant baad pani chalaa den or apane haath acchhee tarah se dhoen
 You should wear rubber gloves if the body fluids have spread or your hands are stuck on them
 chemotherapy upachaar karaane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap apane parivaar or doston ke saath kareebi sambandh nahin rakh sakate
 This includes kissing and hugging
 chemotherapy karaane vaale sabhi rogiyon ko flu hone kaa khatra hota he
 If you are undergoing chemotherapy in the autumn or winter, then you are advised against immunization from the flu
 uchit yah hoga ki aap apana chemotherapy upachaar shuru hone ke 7-10 din pehle hi tikaa lagava len
 If your chemotherapy has started, your immunity may not be as good as your response to immunity is likely to decrease
 isse aapkesharir kii rogapratikaarak paidaa karne kii kshamta ghatati he, jo aapako flu se bachaane ke liye jaruri hai
 If you get vaccinated during chemotherapy, you should do so only when your white cell count falls to normal levels
 yadi aapaki safed koshikaon kii sankhya kam he to aapako tikaa lagavane se bachanaa chahie kyonki aisa karne se aapke sharir kaa taapmaana bad saktaa he
 This can lead to a misunderstanding that you have a fever due to infection and as a result you may have to be treated unnecessarily in a hospital
 chemotherapy karaane ke dauraan yadi aap ghar par aswasth mahasoos karen or aapako yah lage ki aisa chemotherapy kii vajah se ho rahaa he to aapako hamen turant sampark karnaa chahie

 If the second meaning is considered to be beautiful, then there can be no contradiction in it and if there is a huge powerful body, it can be said to have a buffalo body which is called Mahish in Sanskrit
 Therefore, this surname Mahishasura may be logical, but to say that it is born of buffalo would be an injustice to them and together it only tarnishes our mindset

 The ruling party at the center is engaged in besieging the opposition Congress under the pretext of emergency
 The Emergency imposed in June 1975 was perhaps the biggest mistake of the Congress, which the party is facing
 During this time, all the leaders of the opposition were put in jail under the MISA Act, ranging from former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Lal Krishna Advani, Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad
 The MISA law was implemented in 1971 but It was used to put Congress opponents, journalists and social workers in jail during the Emergency

 More than one lakh people were arrested under MELA detainees, Jelmisa and DRI 
 During the Emergency, there was a flood of MISA prisoners
 Civil rights were already abolished and then people were tortured in the name of security through this law, their property was taken away
 By making changes, this law was made so stringent that there was no hearing of prisoners in the judiciary
 There were many detainees who remained imprisoned during the entire 21-month emergency
 Laloo's daughter was named Lalu Prasad Yadav, former Chief Minister of Mizabihar and RJD chief also remained MISA prisoner during the Emergency
 Meanwhile, his elder daughter, born in 1976, was also named Misa Bharti because of this law

 spiware malware kaa ek prakaar he jo computer par install kiya jaataa he or upyogkartaaon kii gaiyr-jaankaree main unke bare main suchanaaen ekatra kiya karata he
 The presence of spyware is usually hidden from users
 vishisht rup se, spiware chupake se upyogkartaaon ke vyaktigat computer par install kiya jaataa he
 However, sometimes, spyware such as keyloggers are also installed by the owner of a shared, corporate, or public computer so that other users can be secretly monitored
 spiware shabd se pataa chalata he ki yah ek software he jo upyogkarta ke computer par gupt rup se nigaraanee rakhata he, jabaki spiware kaa kaam mahaj nigaraanee se bhi kahin zyada he
 Spyware collects a variety of personal information, such as Internet surfing habits and the sites it visits
 magar, spiware atirikt software install karke or web brouzar ko punahnirdeshit karne jaise anya tareekon se upyogkarta ke computer ke niyantran main bhi hastkshep kar saktaa he
 Spyware has been known to change computer installations, which slows down connection speeds, different homepage speeds, and / or functionality of the Internet and / or other programs
 spiware ke bare main samaj viksit karne ke prayaas main, gopneeyata-akramanakari software naam ke tahat iske antarvisht software prakaar kaa ek aupchaarik vargeekaran banaaya gaya he
 In response to the emergence of spyware, a small industry has started to make anti-spyware software
 anti-spiware software chalaaya janaa computaron ke liye computer suraksha abhyaason ke tatv ko vyapak rup se manyata mil gayi he, vishesh rup se unke liye jo Microsoft Windows kaa upyog karte hai
 Several anti-spyware laws were enacted to prevent users from secretly installing software to control their computers
 spiware sankraman ke jokhim ko kam karne ke liye america sangheey vyapaar ayog ne internet par upabhoktaaon ke liye ek suzav prishth rakhaa he, jisamen "kya karnaa he" or "kya nahin karnaa he" kii suchi bhi he
 The term adware is often used for any software that displays advertisements for which the user may or may not have given consent
 Customers of programs such as Eudora Mail display their advertisements as an alternative to shareware registration fees
 vigyaapan-samarthit software ke myne main inhen "adware" ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, spiware ke rup main nahin
 is rup main adware gupt rup se kaam nahin karata he yaa upyogkarta ko gumraah nahin karata he or upyogkarta ko ek vishisht seva pradaan karata he
 Most adware is spyware, rather than "ad-supported software" in a different sense, for a different reason: related advertisements are displayed based on information obtained from spying on users
 cleria karporation ke gator software or acject edvertising ke bargenbddi iske udhaaharan hai
 The gator is secretly installed on the machines of the frequent customer who visits the website, and then directs the revenue to the installed site and displays advertisements for the Claria user
 upyogkarta kai pop-ap vigyaapan arthath prakatit vigyaapan praapt karne lagate hai
 Reporting in the background of user viewing of websites is another behavior of spyware
 "lakshyit" vigyaapan prabhaavon ke liye data kaa istemaal hota he
 The proliferation of spyware has led to other programs being viewed with suspicion that even track web browsing for statistical or research purposes
 kuch paryvekshakon ne paaya ki Amazon

 These adware distribution companies are backed by revenue generating billions of dollars
 adware or spiware, virus ke maamle main ek samaan hai, ye donon hi swabhaav se durbhaavnapurna maane gaye
 People are making a profit through misleading adware, such as Antivirus 2009, also known as scarware
 isi prakaar, P2P jaise vigyaapan-samarthit prograamon ke ni:shulk software kii potli ek spiware ke rup main kaam karti he, phir bhi log ise downlod karne ke liye taiyaar rahete hai
 This poses a dilemma for owners of anti-spyware products because their removal tools may inadvertently disable the intended program

 To accomplish their goal, this group of anti-spyware companies, academics and consumer groups have collectively published a series of documents including the definition of spyware, risk models and best practice
 virus or varm ke vipareet, spiware aamtaur par swa-pratikrut nahin hota he
 However, many recent viruses employ infected computers for commercial gain through spyware design

 However, spyware can be dropped by a worm as a payload
 spiware virus yaa varm ke rup main sidhe kisi computer main nahin failata: aamtaur par sankramit pranali duusare computer main sanchaarit hone kaa prayaas nahin karti he
 Instead, spyware dominates the system through user vulnerabilities or through exploitation of software vulnerabilities
 zyaadaatar spiware upyogkarta kii jaankaree ke bagaiyr install kiye jate hai
 Since they are attentive to the installation of spyware, if they know that it will disturb their work environment and their privacy has to be compromised, spyware can be installed on the back of desired software such as Kaja or by cleverly installing them
 Taxes make users bluff
 kuch "dhoort" spiware kaarykram suraksha software kaa chhadmavesh banaate hai
 Usually distributors of spyware present the program as a useful utility, for example as a "web accelerator" or as a helpful software agent
 Users immediately download and install the software without suspecting that it can cause harm
 udhaaharan ke liye, bonji bady, ek aisa kaarykram he jo spiware kaa bandal he or bacchon ko lakshya banaata he, kaa daawa he : He will seek the Internet with you as your very close friend and assistant! He can speak, chat, humor, browse, search, email and download what no other friend of yours has ever done! It has the ability to compare the price of the products that you want and helps you save money
 ! or sabase acchhee baat yah ki vah ni:shulk he
 Spyware can also come with other bundles of software
 upyogkarta ek program ko downlod karata he or use install karata he or install karanevaala atirikt spiware install kar detaa he
 Although desirable software itself cannot do any harm, the spyware inserted with it can
 kuch maamalon main, spiware nirmaataa shairwayre nirmaataa ko unke software ke saath spiware ko bhi daal dene ke liye bhugtan kar dete hai
 In other cases, spyware manufacturers reinvent desirable freeware with installers that are slipstream spyware
 web broujar yaa anya software main suraksha suraag ke jariye kuch spiware nirmaataa pranali ko sankramit kar dete hai
 When the user guides a web page controlled by the spyware creator, the code contained in the page attacks the browser and forces the spyware to be downloaded and installed
 spiware nirmaataa ko vanijyik rup se uplabdh anti-virus or firewal software kii vistrut jaankaree hoti he
 This is known as "download-driven", leaving users stranded in the attack
 internet explorer or ]] ]] ke karyavidhi main suraksha dosha ko nishaanaa banaakar aam broujar dohan karata he
 This continuously includes Internet Explorer when spyware is installed
 isaki lokapriyata or suraksha muddon ke itihaas ne ise baar-baar nishaanaa banaaya he
 Its deep integration with the Windows environment and script availability makes it a direct site of attack in Windows
 internet ekplorer spiware ke liye broujar sahaayak vastu ke rup main, jo broujar ke vyavhaar ko tulbaar jod kar sanshodhit yaa trephic ko punarnirdeshit kar sangyojan sthal kii tarah bhi kaam karata he
 In some cases, a worm or virus also gives spyware payloads
 kuch hamalavar spiware install karne ke liye spibot varm kaa upyog karte hai, jo sankramit pranali ke screen main ashleel pop-ap daal detaa he
 They make a personal profit by directing traffic to advertising, making it a way for spyware makers to receive money
