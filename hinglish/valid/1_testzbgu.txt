 Wavewave or Wavewaveer or Wavewrecked is a sport on the waves of the sea in which the waveleaders ride a wave coming towards the coast while balancing on a pitch
 laharbaazon ke fatton ko 'lahartakhta' yaa 'sarfaboard' kaha jaataa he
 Waves were invented by the indigenous tribes of the Hawaiian Islands and from there it spread worldwide
 khadey hokar kari jane vaali laharbaazi main do prakaar ke lahartate istemaal hote hai: chote takhte or lambe takhte 
 The styles of riding on them are also different from their shape
 kishti se khinch kar kari gai laharbaazi main ek motor-chaalit laharbaaz ko unchi laharon kii ucchtar gati ke baraabar kii raftaar detaa he jo bina naav kii madad ke laharbaaz nahin paa saktaa
 In kite waveform and wind waveform, the force of the wind captures the wavelength
 padalatate or kayake main laharon kii zaroorat nahin hoti or chappu kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In all these, in addition to paddle and wind, the powers of waves can also be used
 kabhi-kabhi shaktishaalee ingine vaali naukaaon ke zariye bhi pani main lehren banaai ja sakati hai or laharbaaz inpar sawari kar sakate hai
 Waves were an important part of ancient Polynesian culture
 san 1767 main 'dolphin' naamak samudri jahaaz main taahiti pahunche europiyon ne pehali dafaa vahaan ke vaasiyon ko laharbaazi karte hue dekha
 In 1769, a team of explorer Captain James Cook on board a ship called 'endeavor' also saw this in Tahiti
 unhone hawaii main bhi laharbaazi dekhi
 Lieutenant James King, a member traveling on it, later returned to England and wrote a description of it in 1779
 1866 main jab america lekhak mark twain ne hawaii kaa daura kiya to unhone likhaa ki "ek jagah ham bahut se nange adivaasiyon ke jhund main aa pahunche, jo donon lingon or har umr ke the or lahar-snaan ke rashtriya khel kaa mazaa le rahe the"
 In Samoa, also placards and daggers were used in ancient times, and there the game was called "fa'ise'a" or "se'eagalu"
 in baaqi polinisian jagahon kii tarah, tonga main bhi laharbaazi hone kaa varnan he
 Continuous wind blowing over open water in a large area like the sea produces a great wave of waves, called anion
 anayan kitna adhik hoga, yah hawa kii gati or bahaav ke kaal par nirbhar karata he
 Because of this, the movement of waves is more where there is less air pressure and where a long coastline is located on the open sea
 hawa kaa sthaneey bahaav laharon par kaafii asar rakhata he
 If a slight or medium wind is moving at a short distance from the shore, then it walks in front of the wave and gives it the shape of a round drum or tube, which is more enjoyable for rippling
 agar hawa zyaada tej ho to pani ko uttejit or laharbaazi ke liye karaab kar detii he
 The sea floor behind and below the wave also has a profound effect on the wave
 pani main agar reef ho to vah laharon ke akar ko badal detii he
 With modern techniques, the floor and air can be measured and can be visualized as to how the waves are going to happen next
 laharbaazon ko tat par jane se pehle yah bhavishyavaaniyaan radio, akhbaaron or internet ke zariye mil jaati hai
 The rule of swells varies according to the weather and location
 sardiyon main jab uttari or dakshini dhruviya agrabhag bumadhya rekha kii ore badhati he to saghan mahatarang madhya-akshansh main utpann hoti he
 Due to the powerful westerly winds moving towards the east, the highest waves on the west coasts of the countries are seen in winter
 lekin madhya-akshansh par hone vaale chakravaat ke silsile vaqt-vaqt par in mahaatarangon ko ooshnakaribandheey kshetron kii taraf dhakel dete hai
 Low pressure areas are also sometimes formed on the eastern coasts of subtropical areas because high pressure winds sometimes reach low speeds
 is se yahan purvi taton par unchi mahaatarange dekhi jaati hai
 In summer, cyclones in the hot region produce heavy swells
 yah chakravaat garm samudr main utpann hote he, isiilie el nino or laa nina chakra se prabhavit hote he
 There is no confidence in the direction of such cyclones
 yah kabhi pashchim ko bhi nikal jate hai jaise ki 1979 main kari chakravaat ke saath hua
 It roamed the Coral Sea and the Queensland Province of Australia for three weeks before vanishing weakly
 vargeekaran maandand In some coastal areas artificial reefs are built to attract wavelength tourists from high waves
 yah pani main ret kii boriyaan yaa koncrit kii badi silliyaan dubo kar banaai jaati hai
 Sometimes a submerged large rook also acts as a reef
 yah reefein na sirf laharbaazi ke liye acchhee hoti he balki bich ko bhi samay ke saath samudr dwaara khaae jane se bachaati hai
 a Turkish ship called 'selly 1' sank in Table Bay in the Cape Town area of south Africa in 2009 and is now making good waves there
 dakshin bharat ke kowalam tat main sthaneey logon ne ek kritrim reef banaai to tat kii raksha kar rahaa he or laharbaazi ke liye acchhee lehren bhi detaa he
 In contrast, an artificial reef called 'chevron Reef' was built off the El Segundo coast of South California, but the hopes of reef builders receded as it did not make good waves
 laharbaaz laharbaazi par aadhaarit ek vividh samskruti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Some people practice waveform as an amateur activity, while others consider it to be the central theme of their lives
 sanyukt rajya america ke california, florida or hawaii rajyon main laharbaazi samskruti sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee he
 Things related to this include 'woody' - it is a long stationwagon car on which waves are carried
 laharbaazon ko 'brodshorts' naamak ek lambi nekar bhi pahanani pasand hoti he
 Every year tens of billions of dollars of goods are now bought and sold in the sale of wave related goods
 laharbaazi na karne vaale bhi is khel se sambandhit hone ke liye iske chihn apanaate hai
 Waves classify each other into three categories: laharbaazon kii aapasi baatcheet se bhi bahut se nae shabd paidaa hue hai: Some surfers were so immersed in the game that they had to do something similar even if the favorable waves were not there
 is cheshtaa main unhone takhton ke neeche pahiye lagaakar 'paidalpath laharbaazi' shuru kar di
 It is now called 'skateboarding'
 aage chalakar yah pahadiyon par barf ke upar takhton par bhi khelaa jane laga or is khel kaa naam 'snowbording' padaa
 To ride the wave, the wavelengther makes his way out to the sea off the coast of Lat
 vah apane haathon ko patavaar banaakar tairkar samudr main kuch dur nikalataa he
 Then he turns and faces the coast and tries to match the speed of the wave moving towards the coast, carrying his plank towards that side

 The greenhouse effect or greenhouse effect is a natural process by which some gases present in the atmosphere of a planet or satellite help to make the temperature of the atmosphere relatively high
 in greenhouse gaison main carbon daai oxide, jal-vaashp, mithen aadi shaamil hai
 If there was no greenhouse effect, there would hardly have been life on Earth, because then the average temperature of the Earth would have been -18 ° c and not the current 15 ° C

 The letters and sounds of these scripts are as follows: henrik oto warburg germany ke jeevarsayan shastri or shodhakarta the
 His mother's name was Elizabeth Gartner and father's name was Emil Warburg, a physicist at the University of Berlin
 amil ainstin ke mitra the or inhone mex plank ke saath bhi kaam kiya tha
 Otto received a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Berlin in 1906 and a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1911
 iske baad kuch samay ve hidelburg main hi shodh karte rahe
 But in 1913, he was appointed to the prestigious Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan unhone sena main bhi kaam kiya or unhone aayran cross padak praapt kiya
 But Einstein forced him to leave the army and inspired him to invest his talent and precious time in research work for human welfare
 san 1931 main ve wilhem institute ke nirdeshak ke pad se sammanit kiye gayi
 He remained in charge of this institution until his death
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad iskaa naam badal kar mex plank institute rakh diya gaya
 In the early twenties, Dr
 Otto began research on the action of oxygen being carried by living cells
 san 1923 main iske liye unhone ek vishesh dabaav-maapak yantra viksit kiya jise unhone warburg menometer naam diya
 This manometer was also able to measure the speed of oxygen uptake by a thin layer of biological tissue
 unhone shwasan-kriya ko utprerit karne karne vaale tatwon par bahut shodh kii or tabhi oxigen-parivahan anzim cytochrome kii khoj kii, jiske liye unhen 1931 main nobel puraskaar mila
 Otto first reported that cancer cells consume much less oxygen than normal cells
 unhone hydrogen cynide or carbon-mono-oxide par bhi shodh kii or bataaya ki ye shwasan-kriya ko baadhit karte hai
 He studied a lot of the sub-components nicotinamide and dehydrogenase enzymes etc
 for biochemical activities
 unhone yah bhi siddh kiya ki cancer koshika ke piech or oxigen upbhog main sidhaa sambandh hota he
 If the ph is high, the oxygen content in the cell will be high
 unhone yah bhi batalaaya ki cancer koshika main lactic acid or carbon-daai-oxide banane ke kaaran piech bahut kam lagbhag 6
0 hota he
 Other topics of his research were electron transport chain in mitochondria, photosynthesis in plants, metabolism of cancer cells etc
 san 1963 ke baad se germany main jirasayan shaastra or aanvik jeevigyaan main acchhee shodh karne vaale vaigyanikon ko oto warburg medal se sammanit kiya jaataa he or 2007 ke baad se 25000 euro kaa nakad puraskaar bhi diya jaataa he
 Receiving this award is considered very honorable for scientists

 He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1931 for the discovery of oxygen-transport enzymes in cellular-respiration and also in 1944 for the discovery of active ingredients for hydrogen-transport enzymes, but it was said to be Otto was a citizen of Jewish origin, so Adolf Hitler did not want him to be given the Nabel Prize

 kisi bhi rog ke mukhya or dwitiyak yaa gaunn kaaran hote hai
 For example, the main cause of plague is germs of plague, while secondary causes are dirt, rats and fleas
 mukhya kaaran se abhipraay yah he ki yah us rog se peedit har rogi main vidyaman hota he
 Similarly, there can be countless secondary causes of cancer
 lekin cancer kaa mukhya kaaran oxigen dwaara saamaanya koshikeey shwasan-kriya kaa baadhit hokar sharkara ke khamirikaran main parivartit ho janaa he
 All the cells in the body respire by oxygen to obtain energy, while the cancer cell obtains energy by fermenting sugars
 sabhi saamaanya koshikaaye darasal vayujeevi hai or cancer koshika aanshik avayujeevi hai jo nimna-stareey ekkosiya jeevon kii bhanti glucose kaa khamir karke jivan vyapan karti he
 This difference between normal and cancer cells is important from the point of view of physical and chemistry
 dehlem institute main shuru se hi cancer par shodh ho rahi thi
 Oxygen-transport enzymes Hydrogen-transport enzymes were discovered here and their chemical structure was closely studied
 yadi yah satya he ki cancer kaa pramukh kaaran oxigen dwaara saamaanya shwasan kriya kaa baadhit hokar khamirikaran main parivartit hona he to bina kisi apwaad ke sabhi cancer koshikaaye khamir dwaara shwasan kriya karengi or saamaanya koshikaaye kabhi bhi khamir dwaara shwasan nahin karengi
 Two American scientists Melmgren and Flenegan proved this by simple experimentation
 unhone chuhon ke rakt main titains ke bijaanu chode, jo oxigen ke abhaav main hi ankurit hokar foot jate he or titains failaane vaale keetanuon ko janm dete hai
 They found that the mice were healthy and had no visible symptoms of tetanus, as there was no place in their body where there was not enough oxygen
 lekin jab cancer se peedit chuhon ke rakt main titains ke bijaanu chode to chuuhe titains rog se grasit ho gayi, kyonki unke sharir main cancer kii gaanthon ke bheetar oxigen kii maatra itani kam thi ki titains ke bijaanu ankurit hokar phute or titains ke keetanu baahar nikle or chuuhe titains rog se grasit ho gayi
 These experiments make it clear that cancer cells are partial anaerobic and normal cells are airborne
 ham yahan ek alag tarah ke prayogon ko samajhane kii kushish karte hai jo cancer main khamirikaran or cancer kii vruddhi-dar ke bich maatraatmak sambandhon ko darshaate hai
 Harold Morris, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, in his experiments, showed different rates of growth in cancerous lumps in mice when differentiated liver carcinogens were released into the blood of mice
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki jahaan kisi chuuhe kii ganthen teen din main bad kar doguni ho gai vahiin kisi anya chuuhe kii gaanth ko do guna hone main 30 din lag gayi
 Dean Burke and Mark Woods 3 of the National Cancer Institute also showed a graph showing the rate of fermentation in different hepatomas and the rate of hepatoma progression
 unhone paaya ki khamir or vruddhi-dar main sidhaa maatraatmak sambandh he
 He observed that as the rate of growth of hepatoma increases, fermentation also increases in the same proportion or more rapidly
 dean bark or mark woods ne apane graph ke shunya-bindu kshetra main khamirikaran kii dar itani kam hoti he ki use paaramparik tareekon se naapnaa sambhav nahin he jabaki usee kshetra main gaanth kii nunatam vruddhi-dar aasaani se naapi ja sakati he
 But when they developed more sensitive methods of measuring the fermentation of sugars, it was proved that very slowly growing cancers also leaven sugars
 ab yah to siddh ho gaya he ki sharkara ko khamir karke urja grahan karnaa cancer-koshika kii khaas fitarat he, to aaiye ab yah samajhane kii kushish karen ki kaise ek saamaanya koshika badalakar avayujeevi ban jaati he arthath cancer-koshika main parivartit ho jaati he
 For this we try to understand the experiments done by Gahen, Gaisler and Lorenz of Dehlem Institute
 jab chuuhe ke bhrun kii koshikaon ko ek upyukt madhyam main rakhaa jahaan oxigen kaa str bhi paryaapt to ve oxigen kii maujuudagi main viviya shwasan-kriya karti rahi, vibhajit hoti rahi or khamirikaran bhi nahin hua
 But when the oxygen levels were lowered so much that the pneumatic respiration of the cells began to be partially obstructed, they were transformed into leukemic cancer cells after 48 hours of two-cell division
 or ve avayaviya-shwasan karne lagi
 We then developed an oxygen pressure and fermentation gauge in the dividing embryonic cells, which is clearly shown in the attached diagram
 is vyavastha main hamane dekha ki viviya shwasan 35 pratishat kam karne par koshikaaye cancer-koshikaon main roopaantarit ho gai
 If the pressure of oxygen in the body decreases enough that the pneumatic respiration of the dividing cells is obstructed by 35 percent, then cancer becomes
 isse yah siddh hua ki sharir main viviya shwasan aanshik rup se baadhit hone par cancer-koshikaaye banane lagati hai or khamirikaran dwaara shwasan karne lagati hai
 In the early stages of the development of our earth, the atmosphere was deoxygenated and in the name of life, only organisms respired by indistinguishable monocular yeast existed
 phir arabon varshon baad jab hamaare vaataavaran main oxigen kaa aagaman hua, to ye avibhedit ek-kosiya jeev vibhedit hone lage, viviya shwasan karne lage or is tarah prithvi par vanaspatiyon or jeevajantuon kaa vikaas shuru hua
 But we still see this differentiation in cancer cells
 ham yah bhi dekhte hai ki kai baar vaataavaran main paryaapt oxigen hone par bhi cancer kaa vikaas ho rahaa he, kyonki yaa to vibhajit ho rahi koshikaon tak paryaapt oxigen nahin pahunch rahi he yaa koshikaon main shwasan-anzimes ko utprerit karne vaale sakriy tatv vidyaman nahin hai
 But whatever the situation, in cancer, oxygen-respiration is always interrupted, fermentation occurs and cells begin to differentiate
 cancer koshikaon main vyarth aniyantrit vibhajit hone kii kshamta bachati he or jivan ke liye aavashyak sabhi kaary-kshamtaayen samaapt ho jaati hai
 That is, when respiration is interrupted, cancer is born, then life exists, but it is nothing but a group of directionless cells that are dividing
 ab prashn he ki kyon oxigen bhedan karti he or oxigen kii kami kyon avibhedan karti he? yaa kyon shwasan-kriya bhedan karti he or khamirikaran avibhedan karata he
 While both respiration and fermentation are capable of cell division and if fermentation also had penetrating potential, cancer might not exist on this earth
 is tarah kai prashn hai jinka spashtikaran sambhawatah jeevarsayan shaastra de saktaa he
 Phosphate energy is used in both respiration and fermentation but both have different modes of phosphorylation
 cancer ke sandarbh main dekhen to viviya phosforilation bhedan kar sakane main sakasham he, lekin khamiri phosforilation main yah kshamta nahin he
 From the metabolic pathway of respiration and fermentation, it is clear that there is no difference in metabolism of the two until pyruvic acid is formed
 lekin iske baad donon kaa kriya-path alag-alag bhang se hota he
 In fermentation, pyruvic acid is decomposed by dihydro-nicotinamide in the same chemical reaction to form lactic acid
 jabaki viviya shwasan main piruvik acid oxigen kii upasthiti main kai jatil rasaynic kriyaaon se guzar kar jal or carbon-daai-oxide banaata he
 salient points • khamirikaran kii apeksha shwasan-kriya ko baadhit karnaa aasaan he kyonki shwasan zyada jatil prakriya he
 • When respiration is impaired, cells begin to ferment easily because the same catalytic nicotinamide acts in both functions
 • jab koshika main saamaanya shwasan-kriya baadhit hoti he or khamirikaran uski jagah letaa he, to glucose kaa apghaton hota he or urja kii kami ke kaaran koshika mrity ho jaati he
 Decomposition of glucose means death by fermentation and anaerobic respiration means life by fermentation
 • cancer isiilie hi hota he kyonki shwasan-kriya hi koshikaon ko bhedan kii kshamta detii he, na ki khamirikaran
 In conclusion, i want to say that cancer is no longer a mysterious disease and its main cause is obvious to everyone
 hamen cancer se bachaav kii disha main kaary karnaa chaiye
 After all, how long the greedy multinational institutes associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy will not let the benefits of research on cancer reach the common people and keep confusing them
 shaayad tab tak is sansar main karodon log is rog se marate rahenge
 Warburg's lecture was very interesting

34694 Tirupati Venkateswara Temple is a famous Hindu temple located in Tirupati
 tirupati bharat ke sabase prasiddh tirthasthalon main se ek he
 It is located in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh
 prativarsh lakhon kii sankhya main darshanaathi yahaan aate hai
 The Sri Venkateswara Temple, built on the hills of Tirumala, situated at an altitude of 3200 feet above sea level, is the biggest attraction here
 kai shatabdi purv bana yah mandir dakshin bhartiya vaastukala or shilp kala kaa adbhoot udhaaharan hai
 In Sangam literature, one of the earliest literature of Tamil, Tirupati is called Trivangadam
 tirupati ke itihaas ko lekar itihaaskaaron main matbhed hai
 But it is clear that by the 5th century it had established itself as a major religious center
 kaha jaataa he ki chol, hoysal or vijaynagar ke raajaaon kaa aarthik rup se is mandir ke nirmaan main khaas yogadan tha
 One of the followings about this temple is as follows
 prabhu venkateshwar yaa balaji ko bhagwaan vishnu kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 It is believed that Lord Vishnu lived for some time on the banks of a pond called Swami Pushkarani
 yah talab thirumala ke paas sthit he
 Tirumala - The hills around Tirupati are called 'saptagiri', built on the basis of the seven fauna of Sheshnag
 shri venkateshwaraiya kaa yah mandir saptgiri kii saatvin pahari par sthit he, jo venkatadri naam se prasiddh he
 According to another observation, Saint Ramanuja climbed this seventh hill of Tirupati in the 11th century
 prabhu shrinivas unke samaksh prakat hue or unhen aashirwad diya
 It is believed that after receiving the blessings of the Lord, he lived till the age of 120 years and wandered from place to place and spread the fame of Lord Venkateswara
 vaikunth ekadshi ke avasar par log yahan par prabhu ke darshan ke liye aate hai, jahaan par aane ke pashchaat unke sabhi paap dhul jate hai
 It is believed that after coming here one gets freedom from the bond of birth and death
 mana jaataa he ki is mandir kaa itihaas 9veen shatabdi se prarambh hota he, jab kanchipuram ke shaasha vansh pallvon ne is sthaan par apana aadhipaty sthapit kiya tha, parantu 15 sadi ke vijaynagar vansh ke shashan ke pashchaat bhi is mandir kii khyaati simit rahi
 After 15 century, the fame of this temple started spreading far and wide

 beesvin shatabdi ke prakhyat british ganitagya or darshanik bartend rasel ke anusaar ‘‘ganit ko ek aise vishay ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jisamen ham jaanate hi nahin ki ham kya kah rahe hai, na hi hamen yah pataa hota he ki jo ham kah rahe hai vah satya bhi he yaa nahin
 '' ganit kuch amoort dharanaon evam niyamon kaa sankalan maatr hi nahin he, balki dainandin jivan kaa muladhar he
 Since ancient times, mathematics has been paramount in all types of knowledge - mahaan ganitagya gouse ne kaha tha ki ganit sabhi vigyaanon kii rani he
 Mathematics is an important tool of science and technology
 bhautikee, rasayan vigyaan, khagol vigyaan aadi ganit ke bina nahin samajhe ja sakate
 Historically, in fact, many branches of mathematics were developed only because of their need in the natural sciences
 kuch had tak ham sab ke sab ganitagya hai

 Although a common man should not have much to deal with the history of mathematics far more than a thousand years back, but scientists, mathematicians, technologists, economists and many other experts in one form or another of the advanced systems of mathematics in everyday life
 Use on a vast, unimaginable scale
 aajkal ganit dainik jivan ke saath sarvyaapee rup main samaaya hua dikhataa he
 How mathematics originated is forgotten in the pages of history today
 magar hamen maaloom he ki aaj ke 4000 varsh pehle babylon tathaa misr sabhyataaen ganit kaa istemaal panchang banane ke liye kiya karti thim jisase unhen purv jaankaree rahati thi ki kab fasal kii buaai kii jaani chahie yaa kab nil nadi main baadh aegi, yaa phir iskaa prayog ve varg samikarnon ko hal karne ke liye kiya karti thim

 ise bhi dekhen : bhartiya ganit, bhartiya ganitagya suchi Mathematics is a byproduct of the human brain
 maanav kii gatividhiyon evam prakruti ke nirikshan dwaara hi ganit kaa udbhav hua
 Mathematics articulates and articulates itself in the core of the thinking processes of the human mind and turns into a world of real world concepts
 ganit vaastavik jagat ko niyamit karne vaali moort dharanaon ke peeche kaam karne vaale niyamon kaa adhyayan karata he
 The mathematics of most daily life is the essence of these basic concepts and hence it can be easily understood
 haalanki adhikansh dharanaen ant:pragna ke dwaara hi ham par prakat hoti he, phir bhi shuddh evam sankshep rup main un dharanaon ko vyakt karne ke liye uchit shabdaawalee evam kuch niyamon or pratikon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, mathematics has its own language and script which is necessary to know and understand first

 It is ironic that most people shy away from mathematics by showing disinterest, while the fact is that it has utility in every sphere of life and knowledge
 yah keval sanyog nahin he ki archimedes, newton, gaus or lagranj jaise mahaan vaigyanikon ke vigyaan ke saath-saath ganit main bhi apana mahaan yogadan diya he
 At present, mathematics is broadly divided into two parts: vigyaan, arthshaastra or anya kai kshetron main prayog kiya jane vaala ganit praayogic ganit he or isamen adhyayan kii jane vaali ganitiya samasyaon kaa strot kisi or kshetra main hota he
 Under this, mechanics, landlessness, earth science, astrology etc
 are subjects
 shuddh ganit swayan ganit main upji un samasyaon kaa hal dhundta he jinka anya kshetron se sidhaa sambandh nahin he
 Many times applications of pure mathematics are found over time and thus some part of it comes in experimental mathematics
 shuddh ganit ke antargat, bijganit, jyamiti or sankhya siddhant aadi aate hai
 The well-known theorem of Pharma is a part of the number theory
 shuddh ganit kaa vikaas beesvin shatabdi main bahut adhik hua or iske vikaas main 1900 main david hilbert ke dwaara paris main diye gayi vyaakhyaan kaa bahut yogadan rahaa
