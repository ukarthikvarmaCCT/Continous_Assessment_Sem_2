 - Input IANS madhya pradesh kii shivaraj sarkaar or carch ke bich yudgh main jeet carch kii hui
 In fact, on 18 March, the government issued a circular directing the admission of children from disadvantaged and weaker sections to 25 per cent seats in unaided Christian missionary schools
 aise 10,000 se zyada skulon ne yah daawa karte hue sarkaar ko lalakaara tha ki supreme court ne unhen rhite tu ajukeshan (artii) ke daayre se baahar rakhaa he
 The matter reached the Madhya Pradesh High Court where this circular was quashed
 rajya kii schuli shiksha mantri archana chitanis ne press main jari bayaan main kaha tha ki adhinium main sanshodhan ke chalate ab artii ko gaiyr-sahaayta praapt skulon main bhi lagu kiya jayega or isse baahar keval vahi skool honge jahaan dharmik shiksha di jaati he
 It also said that this amendment was made following an order of the Supreme Court which came last year
 rajya sarkaar ke vidhi vibhaag ne bhi raay di thi ki isai mishanri sahit anya alpsankhyakon ke shikshan santhaan jahaan dharmik shiksha nahin di jaati he, artii kii seemaa main aate hai isliye, ‘aise skulon ko 25 fisadi siton par abhavagrast or kamjor tabake ke bacchon ko pravesh dena hoga
 'on the other hand, Bhopal Archbishop Leo Cornelio claimed that this circular is contempt of the Supreme Court because in a judgment on 12 April 2012, the apex court excluded the schools of unaided minorities from the purview of RTE
 archbishap kehete hai, ‘‘circular galati se jari kar diya gaya lagata he
 It has been said in the circular that due to amendments in the law, unaided schools will also come under its purview
 agar aisi baat he to iskaa paalan karne main hamen koi dikkat nahin he
 But as far as i know, we do not come under the purview of this law
 ’’is circular ke baad isai alpsankhyakon ke skulon ke sabhi praachaaryon ne 23 march ko bhopal main baithak kii, jisamen yah nishkarsh niklaa ki schuli shiksha vibhaag ko artii kanoon ke kriyanvayan ko lekar samajhane main bhul hui he
 According to the principal, the amendment in Section 1 of the law says, "in view of the provisions of Articles 29 and 30 of the Indian Constitution, the RTE Act 2009 will ensure the right to free and compulsory education to children
 ’’ lekin praachaaryon ke mutabik circular main ‘‘praavdhaanon ke maddenjar’’ vaakya kii galat vyakhya kar lee gai he or anuchhed 29 or 30 ke tahat alpsankhyakon ke sansthaanon ko mila visheshadhikaar ‘‘vaidic paathshaalaon or madrason’’ par bhi lagu hota he
 Says Father Solomon S
, MP Madhya Pradesh Catholic Church Public Relations Officer, "the principals have found that privileges granted to institutions of unaided minorities do not end with the amendment
 ’’ praachaaryon ne tay kiya tha ki ve skulon main artii act ke tahat pravesh nahin denge
 However, he agreed to grant financially weaker children admission in the institute
 yah vivaad lagbhag ek saal se jari tha
 Missionary schools want to avoid RTE because they believed that this would begin to interfere with leaders in the school's admission process
 ek padri kehete hai, ‘‘netaa rajnatik phaayde ke liye hamen har kisi ko pravesh dene ke liye majaboor karenge
 We do not want something like this happening in our prestigious schools
 jaruratmand or garib logon ko nishulk shiksha ham de hi rahe hai
 "against the government circular, a Christian school in Jabalpur had approached the High Court, on which giving a big blow to the state government, the court has canceled this circular

 The devastation after the inundation in Uttarakhand would not have been so drastic if the state government had not made mistakes rate by mistake
 chaar dham main aae sailaab ko 18 din ho chuke hai or ab bhi log pahaad par fanse hue hai
 Most of the local people are being told
 puure desh ne pahaad kaa jo dard jhela he, usamen vijay bahuguna kii sarkaar ne 10 badi galtiyaan kii hai
 It is true that no one is in the fury of nature, but the Vijay Bahuguna government made such mistakes, which made the tragedy on the mountain even more terrible
 traasadee se pehle mausam vibhaag kaa alert nazarandaaj kiyamausam vibhaag ne pahaad par aae sailaab se do din pehle hi tabaahi kii chetavanee de di thi, lekin sarkaar kaan main tel daalkar soi rahi
 Neither people were taken out of danger nor was anyone prevented from approaching death
 iske baad jo hua, use dekhakar puraa desh ro padaa
 The government could understand the seriousness of the tragedy
 If the government had understood the severity of the inundation, then timely help could be provided to the needy people
 lekin isaki jagah sarkaar mauton kaa aankada dene main juty rahi
 The government did not act until three days after the disaster
 The Uttarakhand government took a long time to understand the seriousness of the tragedy and start a rescue operation
 teen din tak sarkaar harakat main nahin ai
 And this is the reason that those who returned from the mountain were seen cheering the army and security forces
 aapadaa ke baad raahat kaaryon main deree kiaamtaur par july se pahaad par barish shuru ho jaati he, chattaane khisakane lagati hai, aapadaa kii ashanka bad jaati he

 Failure to protect the pilgrims swept the hotel in the inundation of the pilgrimage in which the pilgrims were packed
 lekin pehle se chetavanee hone ke baavjood logon ko surakshit sthanon par pahunchane main sarkaar chook gai
 Administration not seen in relief work: Administration was the most needed in the relief work, but it remained absent
 sarkaar se ummid thi ki sthaneey prashasan ke jariye logon kii madad kii jaati, lekin aisa dekhne ko nahin mila
 The army and security agencies did not coordinate with the army and security personnel made way to reach the trapped people, but the entire Uttarakhand government was missing in the entire mission, which knew every way on the mountain
 18 din baad bhi hajaaron log lapataapada jitani badi thi, naakaami usase bhi vikaraal dikhi
 Thousands of people are still looking for their loved ones, but there is no one to answer
 sthaneey logon ke punarvaas kaa plan nahinpahad par based or raste main fanse logon ko raahat mili to kaise, jab shiviron kii haalat hi khasta he
 Rehabilitation is entirely the responsibility of the government, but no concrete steps have been taken in this direction so far
