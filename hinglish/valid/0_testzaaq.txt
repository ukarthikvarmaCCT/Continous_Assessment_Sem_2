 William James was an American philosopher and psychologist who also trained as a physician
 inhone manovigyaan ko darshanashastra se pruthak kiya tha, isliye inhen manovigyaan kaa janak bhi man jaataa he
 William James wrote a book for the study of psychology called "principles of Psychology"
 iskaa bhai henry james prakhyat upanyaaskaar tha
 James is noted for his charming writing style and skill of expression
 wiliam james kaa janm 11 janvari 1842 ko neuyark main hua
 James studied medical science at Harvard Medical School and was a professor of physiology, psychology, and philosophy from 1872 to 1907 respectively
 1899 se 1901 tak edinburgh vishvavidhyalay main prakritik dharm par or 1908 main oxfard vishvavidhyalay main darshan par vyaakhyaan die
 He died on August 26, 1910
 1890 main uski pustak prinsipills ow cycolaji prakashit hui, jisane manovigyaan ke kshetra main kranti si machaa di, or james ko usee ek pustak se jaagtik khyaati mil gai
 In his other works he used his psychological beliefs to solve problems of philosophy and religion and found his solution in his consequentialism and fundamental empiricism
 falanumeyapramanvadi james ne 'gyaan' ko brihattar vyaavhaarik sthiti kaa, jisase vyakti swayan ko sansar main pratishthit karata he, bhaag maanate hue 'gyaata' or 'gyey' ko jivi or parivesh ke rup main sthapit kiya he
 Thus, truth is not an antecedent reality, rather it is based on the degrees of practical success of the suffix
 sabhi bauddhik kriyaaon kaa mahatv unki vyaavhaarik uddeshyon kii purti kii kshamta main nihit he
 Foundational empiricism was presented by James as the first psychological theory
 jon lock or george barkali ke maton se bhinn uski manyata thi ki chetana kii parivartansheel sthitiyaan paraspar sambandhit rahati hai; tadnusaar samgr anubhav kii sthitiyon main sambandh sthapit ho jaataa he; mastishk aadi koi bahya shakti usamen sahaayak nahin hoti
 The brain distinguishes the totality of direct experience
 falanumey pramanyawad or aadharbhoot anubhavvaad par hi james kii dharmik manyataayen aadhrut hai
 Consequentialism was more helpful in the interpretation of religious beliefs than truth; Because beliefs are often practical even in the absence of proof of arguments; But from a consequentialist point of view, the definition of truth is questionable
 'da vil tu bilive' main james ne antahkaran ke yaa samvegajanya pramaanon par bal diya he or siddh kiya he ki uddeshy or sankalp hi vyakti ke drushtikon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 In 'the Varities of Religions Experience', James shows the person as passive and powerless and also shows that he is protected by an external force
 james ke anubhavvaad se dharmik anubhuti kii vyakhya isaliye asambhav he ki in anubhutiyon kaa vyakti ke avchenat se sidhaa sambandh hota he
 Three things are important in James's philosophy - james kii anya prakashit pustaken 'cycholji', brifer course', 'human immaratlity', taks tu teachers aan cycholji', 'pragmatism', 'a pluralistic univers', 'da mining ov truth, 'memories and studies', 'sam prablams ov philasphi', 'assej in radical ampirisism' he

 vah usase shaadi karnaa chahta he, isliye vah use or uske parivaar ko shaadi ke liye tang karata he
 Sanchi tries many tricks to avoid marriage and Indu
 ek din indu shaadi ke liye uske parivaar ko manwaane ke liye uske ghar aata he
 They all agree
 sanchi ek pandit ko yah kahkar laati he kii vah is tarah se kundali dekhe kii yah shaadi na ho
 He says that if married, the boy's mother will die
 lekin yah bhi kuch kaam nahin aa sakaa
 After that, Sanchi goes to college the next day wearing very short clothes
 isse indu krodhit ho jaataa he
 After this he asks Sanchi to buy good clothes
 lekin sanchi use ulta sidhaa kahati he
 Some boys start teasing him in a short distance
 yah dekh indu un ladakon kii pitayee kar detaa he
 After that the boys run away

 The prose and poet depicted modern Soviet Ukraine and heroic past history
 san 1941-45 ke mahaan deshbhaktipurna yuddh ke baad ukraini sahitya main or bhi adhik nae kavi or lekhak paidaa hue
 The current Ukrainian poets, such as Pavlo Tichina, Maxim Rilsky, Mikola Vazhan, Andrai Malishko, Sosura, etc
 in their poems depict the lives of laborers and peasants and struggle for world peace and the feelings of friendship of the people of different countries
 ukraini naatakkaar, jaise cornachuk, sobako, dmitranko aadi saamaajik, aitihaasik or vyangatmak naatakon kii rachana karte hai

 saath hi soviet sangh kii anya bhashaaon ke sahitya tathaa videshi saahitiyon kii rachanaayen ukraini bhashaa main anudit or prakashit ho rahi hai
 These include many works of ancient and ancient Indian literature
 bhartiya kavyachaaryon ne rason kii sankhya praaia: nau hi maani he jinamein se hasya ras pramukh ras he
 Just as the six juices of taste of tongue are famous, similarly the nine juices of taste of heart are famous
 jihva ke aswaad ko loukik anand kii koti main rakhaa gaya he kyonki uskaa sidhaa sambandh loukik vastuon se he
 The taste of the heart is considered to be in the category of supernatural bliss because it is not directly related to objects but to emotions
 bhavanubhuti or bhavanubhuti ke aswaad main antar he
 Indian poetesses have considered the number of rasas to be nine only because by their opinion there are only nine expressions which are closely related to the basic instincts of man and have full potential for stability and they have developed and are said to possess the realization of rasa noun
 Can go yah manyata vivaadaaspad bhi rahi he, parantu hasya kii rasarupata ko sabhi se nirvivaad rup se sweekaar kiya he
 Psychology experts have also given Haas a proper place as the original trend and have given adequate consideration in its analysis
 is manan chintan ko paurvatya kavyachaaryon kii apeksha paashchaatya kavyachaaryon ne vistaarpurvak abhivyakti di he, parantu phir bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki unhone is tatv kaa puri vyapaktaa ke saath adhyayan kar liya he or yaa hasyaras yaa haas kii kavyagat abhivyanjana kii hi koi aisi paribhaasha de di he jo sabhi sabhi prakaar ke udaahranon ko apane main samet sake
 Indian Acharyas have promulgated this in a form of formulas, but in their brief statements, almost all the findings and elements of Western critics can be easily seen
 hasyaras ke liye bharatmuni kaa naatyashaastra kahata he- It is written in Bhavaprakash- sahityadarpanakaar kaa kathan he- Similarly- dasharupakkaar kii ukti he- This implies that Haas is a ritualistic gesture and a form of Chittavikas
 uskaa udrek vikrut aakaar, vikrut vesh, vikrut aachaar, vikrut abhidhaan, vikrut alankaar, vikrut arthvishesh, vikrut vaani, vikrut cheshtaa aadi dwaara hota he - in vikrutiyon se yukt hasyapatrata chaahe abhinayta kii ho, chaahe vaktaa kii ho, chaahe anya kisi kii ho
 Deformation means any imagery that is contrary to the expected or singular, some absurdity, which we may find loving, may not be traumatic
 in lakshanon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi lakshan samavisht ho jate hai, jahaan tak unka sambandh hasya vishyon se he
 When such a development develops, we get it in a free state, in a simplified form by Kavikaushal, or according to the terminology of Acharya Pt
 Ramachandra Shukla, it is called humorous
 haas ke bhav kaa udrek desh-kaal-paatr-saapeksh rahata he
 If there is an open body at home, the viewer will not laugh but if he reaches in the same way in the festival, then his behavior will arouse laughter because it is considered contrary or perverse than expected; His behavior will become Haas's mother
 yuva vyakti shringaar kare to fabane kii baat he kintu jarjar budde kaa shringaar haas kaa kaaran hoga; kursi se giranevaale pahalwaan par ham nishchit hi hansane lagenge parantu chat se giranevaale bachche par hamaari karunapurna sahanubhuti hi umadegi
 It has already been said that Haas is based on love and not malice, so if one is to sarcasm at the perversion of one's nature, tendency, temperament, ethics, etc
, it is not as sarcasm but as a proverb
 It will not have a feeling of burning or degrading at the bottom, but a feeling of pure purification
 sanshuddhi kii bhaavanavali yah priyokti bhi upadesh kii shabdaawalee main nahin kintu ranjanta kii shabdaawalee main hogi
 Distinctions of humor have also been considered by the Acharyas
 unhone hasya ke do bhed kiye hai
 One is Athastha and the second is Prastha
 hasyapatr kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he swat: us paatr kaa hansnaa or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansaana
 From the point of view of socials or gentle listeners, or theatrical performers, there is selfish humor without the laughter of others, they have excellent humor and poignant humor
 drushtikonon kaa yah antar samaj lene par in donon shabdon ke arthon kaa vichaar saraltapurvak samaapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Then, the Acharyas have made six distinctions of humor - smith, hust, vivid, unassuming, unassuming and unhurried; Those who do not have to be discriminated but will have to accept the distinction of Hasankriya
 sankshep main, aankhon kii muskaraahat smit he
 Seeing thirty-two sounds is beautiful, the sound that comes out is disturbed
 ang hill uthanaa avahasit he
 The stomach laughter is unheralded and the whirring whirring rib is laughable
 sahityadarpanakaar ne smit or hasith ko shreshthon ke yogya kaha he
 The depraved and the subjugated have been called worthy of the middle class people and the abducted and the oppressed are worthy of the lowly people
 rangamanch main darshakon ke liye bhi hansane kii ek maryaada honi chahie, us drushti se uttam, madhyam, adham kii yah baat bhale hi maan lee ja sakati he
 Otherwise, the laughable laughter will deprive the upper class of public health an important element only by understanding the object of inferiority
 dow ramkumar verma ne uttam, madhyam, adham ke prabhaav kii ishti se hasya ke teen bhed maane hai or inhen aatmasth, parastha se guneet karke hasan kriya ke baarah bhed likhe hai
 Smit, Hasit etc
 Hasanakriya Vriddhas can be said to have a sense of humor
 in anubhaavon kaa varnan maatr kar dena alag baat he or apni rachana dwaara saamaajikon main ye anubhav utpann kara dena alag baat he
 Comicer's successful creation is one that spontaneously produces the feel of humor
 videshi vidwaanon ke vichaar se hasya ke paanch pramukh bhed hai jinke naam hai - humar, vit, satair, irni or fars 
 Humer and Fars are related to the subject of humor, while Bit, Satire and Irony are related to the skill of utterance, in which the last two are not only gratifying but also satisfying
 parody bhi hasya kii ek vidha he jiskaa uktikaushal se sambandh he kintu jiskaa pradhan uddeshy he santushti
 Irony means mockery
 uphaas main, hamaare vichaar se, irni kaa bhi antarbhaav maan liya janaa chahie anyathaa vah hasya kii koti se baahar kii vastu ho jaaegi
 Wit or Vagvayadhyaya can be called a specific ornament
 bhartiya sahityapanditon ne jis prakaar shringaar ke saath nyaay kiya he uskaa dashamansh bhi hasya ke saath nahin kiya, yadhyapi bharat muni ne isaki utpatti shringaar se maani he arthath ise rati yaa priti kaa pariman mana he or ise shringaar ke baad hi navrason main mahatv kaa darja diya he
 It has a direct relationship with Anand and has its own specialness not only in terms of Ranjanata but also in terms of utility
 yah tan man ke tanaav dur karata he, swabhaav kii karkashta mitaatha he, aatmanirikshan or aatmaparishkar ke saath hi mithe dhang par samajasudhar kaa maarg prashast karata he, vyakti or samaaj kii thakaan dur kar unamem taazgi bharta hua janaswasthya or lokswasthya kaa upakaarak banataa he
 It is certain that the proportion of importance of this comic in Sanskrit literature and Hindi literature is lacking
 phir bhi aitihaasik simhavlokan se yah bhi spasht ho jaataa he ki sahitya main hasyaras kaa pravaah vaidic kaal se lekar aaj tak nirantar chalaa aa rahaa he, yadhyapi vartmaan kaal ke purv usein vividhta itani nahin jitani aaj dikhaai pad rahi he
 The diversity of the stream of humorous can be seen from the point of view of subject and euphemism
 vishay ko ham akruti, prakruti, paristhiti, vesh, vaani, vyavhaar or vastu main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 The absurdity of the figure is obesity, ugliness, clumsiness, mutilation, irresponsible, belly, hump, extreme blackness of women, etc
 inamen se anek vishyon par hasyaras kii rachanaayen ho chuki hai
 It is worth noting that the ridiculous subject of one time becomes the ridiculous subject of all times, it does not happen
 aaj angabhang, nirmutchta aadi hasya ke vishay nahin maane jate atev ab inpar rachanaayen karnaa hasya kii suruchi kaa parichaayak na mana jayega
 The absurdity of nature or temperament is foolishness, stupidity, hypocrisy, blush, bliss, indecent fashionedness, miserliness, pretentiousness, superfluousness, unauthorized egoism, etc
 akruti ke betukepan kii apeksha prakruti ke betukepan ko apana lakshya banaakar rachanaayen karnaa adhik prashast he
 The creators have done good satire on the practices of skirmish etc
, but many subjects have been left untouched in this direction
 paristhiti kaa betukapan he gangamdari joda samay kii chook samaaj kii asamanjasata main vyakti kii vivashtaa aadi
 a very beautiful example of this is the Kevat episode of Ramcharitmanas in which the fools who boast of understanding Rama's heart, but Panditamanya Kevat are unable to answer and in a way surrender silently
 yah paristhiti kaa vyang tha
 The absurdity of disguise has been a favorite subject of the patron nuts and clowns and can be easily given in skits, Ramlila, Raslila, "gammat", slapstick etc
 dharmadhvagiyon vesh, andhanukaran karanevaale fashanparaston kaa vesh, "mardaani aurat" kaa vesh, aise betuke vesh hai jo rachana ke vishay ho sakate hai
 The composition of the absurdity of disguise will also be of shallow status, similar to the creation of the absurdity of the figure
 vaani kaa betukapan he haklaana, baat baat par "jo he so" ke sadrush takiyakalam lagaana, shabdaskhalan karnaa, amanvi dhvaniyaan, shekhi ke pralaap, gapbaajee, panditau bhashaa, ganvaaru bhashaa, anek bhashaa ke shabdon kii khichdi, aadi
 The absurdity of behavior is confusing incidents, clumsy actions, exaggerations, character distortions, social tantrums, having some sense of something, sitting or doing things, puppetry etc
 hasyaras kii abhivyanjana ke liye, chaahe vah parihaas kii drushti se ho chaahe uphaas kii drushti se, vyavhaar kaa betukapan hi prachur saamagree pradaan kar saktaa he
 From the point of view of human beings, why humans, dev demons, birds, bedbugs, brooms, tokens, plate rationing etc
 have been successfully run on many subjects
 parantu in vastuon or visheshat: isht devon evam prashasnic vyangon ke saath majaak jahaan tak pritibhav ko lekar hoga, vahiin tak hasyaras kii koti kaa adhikari kaha jayega
 Other compositions can be reached in the category of raudra, vibhats or other juices
 abhivyanjana main pratyaashit kaa vaiparity anek prakaar se dekha or dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 It cannot be explained exactly with words like absurdity, distortion, confusion etc
 yah vah vaakkaushal he jiske liye rachanaakaar main bhi paryaapt pratibha apekshit hoti he or us rachana ke drashtaa, shrota yaa pathak main bhi
 a social who will not have the desire and hope of humor, will not have humor and humor in the nature and will not have the ability to understand the word signals and syntactic organs of the intellect, it should be understood that there is no humor for him
 isi prakaar jis kalakaar main parishkarpriyata, pratyutpannamatitv or shabd taulne kii kala nahin he vah hasyaras kaa safal lekhak nahin ho saktaa
 Successful authors with the help of unexpected verbiage, with the unexpected derivation of the word; With the help of unexpected unique analogies etc
 With the help of singular arguments; With the help of the various genres of Vagvadagdhya, namely, with the change of meaning, with the art of shifting the place of bathing in the Pratyutra; With the help of Satire "", Uddhav's utterance in Krishnayan is the building of Madhupuri, Shyam Bajai Bainu? Bhavniprasad Mishra ji’s songfarosh etc
), with the help of sarcasm; With the help of illogical vows; And many similar expressions express humor from styles
 prabhaav kii drushti se hamaari samaj main hasyaras yaa to visheshat: parihaas kii koti kaa hota he yaa uphaas kii koti kaa
 We have not limited these two words in the traditional sense
 jo santushti pradhan kavy he use ham parihaas kii koti kaa maanate hai or jo sanshuddhi pradhan he use uphaas kii koti kaa
 There is also a mixture of both in many compositions
 parihaas or uphaas donon ke liye saamaajikon kii suruchi kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Fleshy ornamental taste, today's modern society cannot be interesting
 devtaa vishyak vyang sahdharmiyon ko hi hansaane ke liye hua karata he
 Suruchi's attention is very important for ridicule
 majaa isamen hi he ki hasyapatr apni trutiyaan samaj le parantu sanket denevaale kaa anugrihit bhi ho jaae or use upadeshta ke rup main na dekhe
 Without sarcasm, consider humor to be ridiculous, whether it is descriptive, whether the effect of the conversation and the effect shown by sarcasm on oneself or others, especially on others, is ridiculous
 bit, humar, parody aadi ke sahare utpann vah haas jo vishuddh santushti kii koti kaa he, parihaas hi kaha jayega
 From the point of view of humor, humor should be considered as the category of softness or that of Attas
 hasith, apasit aadi anya kotiyon kaa inhen donon main antarbhaav maan lenaa chahie
 Two can also be performed of soft-heartedness, one is the secret haas whose pleasure is taken in mind and the other is Sphut Haas whose smile can be seen by other people as well
 attahas ke bhi do bhed kiye ja sakate hai-ek he maryaadit haas jo hansanevaale kii paristhiti se niyantrit rahata he or doosraa he amaryadit haas jisamen paristhiti saapekshata kaa bhaan nahin rahata
 This interpretation of the differences of humor will probably be more scientific
 naatakon main prahasan kii vidha or vidooshak kii upasthiti ne hasya kaa srijan kiya he kintu vah bahumukhi nahin hone paaya
 Many verses of Subhashit have become good, in which both the subject and utterances have a good sense of humor
 kuch udhaaharan de dena apraasangik na hoga
 See the mockery of the relationship of the gods
 prashn tha ki shankar ji ne jehar kyon piya? kavi kaa uttar he ki apni gruhasthi kii dasha se uubakar

 damaad apni sasuraal ko kitni saar vastu mana karata he parantu phir bhi kis akadabaaji se apni puja karavaate rahane kii apeksha rakhaa karata he ya nimna shlokon main dekhie
 Both verses are poetic enough
 jitna vishleshan kiijie utana hi majaa aata jayega: Pranna be dear that life, listen to the conclusion of the poet on this- raja bhoj ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki jo nayaa shloke rachakar laaegaa use ek lakh mudraayen puraskaar main milengi parantu puraskaar kisi ko milane hi nahin paata tha kyonki use medhaavi darbari pandit nayaa shloke sunate hi duhara dete or is prakaar use purana ghoshit kar dete the
 According to the legend, Kalidas stopped speaking after reciting the following verses
 shloke main kavi ne daawa kiya he ki raja ninnanbe karod ratna dekar pita ko rinmukt karen or isapar panditon kaa sakshya le len
 If the pundits say that this claim is not known to them, then one lakh should be given for the creation of this new verse

 Tulsidas ji's Ramacharimanas' Nardamoh episode, Shiva Vivah episode, Parashurama episode etc
 and Surdas ji's Sarsagar's Makhanchori context, uddhav-gopi-dialogue theme etc
 provide good examples of humor
 tulsidas ji kaa nimna chand, jisamen jarajarjar tapasviyon kii shringarlalasaa par mjedaar chutki lee gai he, apni chata main apurv he- Birbal's jokes, Lal Buzhakkad's hanging, Ghagh and Bhadari's epics, Girdhar Kavirai and Ganga's verses, Beni Kaviraj's Bharove and many other compositions are famous of this period
 bharatjivan press ne is kaal kii footkar hasya rachanaaon kaa kuch sankalan apane "bhadova sangrah" main prakashit kiya tha
 In this period, there have been some poignant works, especially about the theme of charity, whose interestingness can not be said even today
 udhaaharan dekhie - a suum had confessed to donating in distress
 uske liye apana vajan ghataane kii uski tarkiben dekhie - The themes of humor and their styles of expression have greatly expanded in the present period

 The main ones are drama and drama, novels and stories, and essays
 in sabhi vidhaon main hasyaras ke anukool prachur maatra main sahitya likhaa gaya or likhaa ja rahaa he
 Talented writers have also presented their comical verses in various forms of prose as well as poetry
 is yug ke praarambhik dinon ke sarvaadhik yashasvi sahityakar hai bhaaratendu babu harishchandra
 His plays are less comical, less vivid and more ridiculous

 His "hang of Churan" is famous

 The Bharatendu period was followed by the Mahavirprasad Dwivedi period which further enhanced and expanded the themes of humor and their expression systems

 Several factors are taken into consideration when assessing the conservation status of a species; Not only the remaining numbers, but also the overall increase or decrease in their population over time, reproductive success rates, known risks and other such factors
 The IUCN Red List is the most known conservation status indexing
 antarrashtriya str par, 194 deshon ne luptpraaya or anya jokhim vaali prajatiyon ke sangrakshan ke liye jaev vividhta kaary-yojana taiyaar karne ke liye sahmati jataane vaale samjhaute par hastakshar kiye hai

 sankatapann prajatiyon kii IUCN laal suchi main jokhim kii ek vishisht shrenee ke taur par luptpraaya prajatiyaan shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Endangered species is among the critically endangered and vulnerable, subject to the IUCN category and norms
 iske alaava, gambhir rup se sankatagrast prajati ko luptpraaya prajati ke rup main bhi gin sakate hai or sabhi mandandon ko bhar sakate hai
 The more common term used by the IUCN for threatened species of extinction is endangered species, including a range of low-risk vulnerable species, including endangered and critically endangered
 IUCN shreniyon main shaamil hai: Under the Endangered Species Act in the United States, "endangered" is more protected in two categories
 salt creek baagh bital ESA ke tahat sangrakshit up-prajati kaa ek udhaaharan he
 In the United States alone, "the number of known species at risk of extinction is ten times the number protected under the Endangered Species Act"
 The US Fish and Wildlife Service as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for the classification and conservation of endangered species, however, adding a specific species to the list is a long, controversial process and is actually a risk
 The flora and fauna represents only a fraction of life
 kuch luptpraaya prajatiyon ke kaanoon vivaadaaspad rahe hai
 Specific areas of dispute include: criteria for placing a species in the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list on the recovery of their populations; Even if a ban on land development means "acquisition" of land by the government; The related question is whether the owners of private land should be compensated for the loss of their land use and whether appropriate exceptions to the conservation laws should be achieved

 luptpraaya prajatiyon ke rup main soochikaran kaa nakaaratmak prabhaav ho saktaa he, kyonki yah prajati ko vishesh rup se sangrahakartaaon or shikariyon ke liye or adhik vaanchhneeya bana sakati hai
 This effect could potentially be mitigated, such as by commercially producing turtles in China, reducing some of the pressure on threatened species to hunt
 soochibaddh prajatiyon ke saath ek or samasya, kisi zamin se luptpraaya prajatiyon ko saafe karne ke 'goli maaro, thelo or chup raho " tareeqe ke upyog ko uksaane ke prati uskaa prabhaav he
 Presently, some landowners experience a decrease in the value of an endangered animal on their land
 unhone kathith taur par, apni zamin se samasya ke nidaan ke liye, chupchaap jaanwaron ko maarane or dafnane yaa unke nivas sthaan ko nasht karne kaa vikalp chunaa he, lekin aise main uske saath-saath, luptpraaya prajatiyon kii aabaadi bhi kam ho jaati he
 The effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act, which coined the term "endangered Species", has been questioned by groups supportive of the trade and its publications, but still widely used by wildlife scientists, working with these species It has been recognized as an effective recovery tool

 According to natureserv's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates, seventeen percent of vascular plants and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered under risk
 Thus, seven to eighteen percent of the total, known animals, fungi and plants of America are near extinction
 This total number exceeds the number of species protected under the Endangered Species Act in the United States, which means that many species are slowly becoming near extinction

 The people of Hawaii have proposed destroying the frog, and many wildlife managers have proposed dropping a pathogen to kill the frogs
 Frogs have reduced house prices and damaged the business of many hotels, so the people of Hawaii have decided that it is acceptable to get rid of the group of cocky frogs that live near them

 Another example of human influence in the lives of endangered species is the mice flying in the Preble grasslands
 Research has shown that the rat is not classically distinct from the Bayer Lodge Whipping Mice, and the US Fisheries and Wildlife Service has proposed the removal of the Preble rat from the endangered species list based on this information
 This example brings the role of science into consideration in determining species maintenance
 yah prashn uthaata he ki kya jaev vividhta ke sangrakshan ke samarthan main sansaadhan ke taur par keval vaigyanik saboot kaa hi istemaal kiya janaa chahie

 An example of the "aesthetic justification" of conserving endangered species is the entry of the gray wolf into Allstone National Park
 The number of tourists in the park has increased due to the gray wolf and it has added to the biodiversity in the protected area
 
 Scrub Mint is another example of supporting the conservation of endangered species as a provider of products for human good
 It has been found that scrub mint contains anti-fungal agents and natural insecticide

 The goal of conservationists is to create and expand methods for conservation of endangered species and maintenance of biodiversity
 There are many ways that we can help in conserving the species going extinct in the world
 inamen ek tareeqa he, prajatiyon ke vibhinn samoohon ke bare main adhik jaankaree praapt karnaa, khaas kar aksheruki, kavak or samudri jeevon ke bare main, jahaan paryaapt data kii kami he
 For example, to understand the causes of population decline and extinction, an experiment was carried out on the butterfly population in Finland

 yah paaya gaya ki titliyon ke vitaran main saadhe ekyavan pratishat tak kii giravat ai he or unka prakritik-vaas gambhir rup se pratibandhit hai
 An example of a decline in the distribution rate of specific butterflies is Frigga's fritillary and grizzled skipper, which have been affected by extensive evacuation of swamps due to their habitat loss
 
 is prayog se sabit hota he ki jab hamen jokhim ke kaaran gyaat hon, to ham safaltaapurvak jaev vividhta prabandhan ke liye samaadhaan taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Another way to help preserve endangered species is to create a new commercial society dedicated to environmental ethics
 This can help ecologists make ethical decisions in the research and management of biodiversity
 iske alaava, paryaavaran naitikta par adhik jaagrukta paidaa karne se prajatiyon ke sangrakshan ko protsaahit karne main sahaayta mil sakati he
 "ethics courses for students and training programs for ecologists and biodiversity managers" can create environmental awareness and prevent violations of the code of conduct in research and management
 a last resort for the protection of endangered species is federal agency investment and protection through conservation enactment by the federal government
 "ecologists have proposed biological corridors, biosphere reserves, ecosystem management and eco-regional planning for integrating biodiversity conservation and increasing large-scale socioeconomic development"

 The purpose of captive breeding is to save extinct species

 This technique has been successfully used for some time, possibly the oldest known such examples of captive mating can be attributed to the system of European and Asian rulers, the case under discussion being the deer of Pere David
 Captive breeding techniques, however, are generally difficult to implement for some migratory birds and highly dynamic species such as fishes

 Along with the development of human civilization and science, its development has also progressed and will continue to happen

 The major topics of international law are as follows : antarrashtriya kanoon ke niyamon kaa sutarapaat vichaarkon kii kalpana tathaa rashtron ke vyavhaaron main hua
 Practices gradually took the form of practices and then those practices became traditions
 atah antarrashtriya kanoon kaa mukhya aadhaar paramparaayen hi hai
 The first place in other grounds is that of treaties occurring in different nations, which is in no way less important than traditions

 Later, various conventions and the decisions of the Election Court, the Court of International Awards and the Court of International Justice gave international law its present form
 antarrashtriya vidhi katipay kaalpanik tatwon par aadhaarit he jinamein pramukh ye hai: The recognition of international law has always depended on the willingness of the states
 koi aisi vyavastha yaa shakti nahin thi jo rajyon ko antarrashtriya niyamon kaa paalan karne ke liye baadhya kar sake athwa niyambhanjan ke liye dand de sake
 This was the main reason for the failure of the League of Nations

 Therefore, such a arrangement has been made in the United Nations Declaration that in the course of time, international law should get the same respect from the states as the law system of a country is from the ruling class or courts in their country

 manovigyaan maanav vyavhaar ke ek nirdharak ke rup main rang kaa adhyayan he
 Color affects experiences that are unclear, such as the taste of food

 For example, red or orange tablets are commonly used as stimulants
 rang vastav main ek vyakti ko prabhavit kar saktaa he; haalanki, yah yaad rakhana mahatvapurn he ki ye prabhaav logon ke bich antar karata he
 Factors such as gender, age and culture can affect a person's point of view of color
 udhaaharan ke liye, vishamalangik purushon kaa yah report karnaa he ki laal poshaak main mahila aakarshan badhata he, jabaki vishamalangik mahilaayein purushon ke kapadon ke kisi bhi rang se prabhavit hone se inkaar karti hai
 Color psychology is widely used in marketing and branding
 kai vipanak rang ko mahatvapurn mante hai kyonki rang kaa istemaal upabhoktaaon kii vastuon or sevaaon ke prathi bhaawanaaon env dharanaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Companies also use color when deciding on brand logos
 jab ye brands logo kaa rang maal yaa sevaaon ke vyaktitv se mail khaataa he, to ye logo adhik graahakon ko aakarshith karne lagate hai, jaise ki gulabi rang ko victoria sikrets ke branding main baari istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Color is also important for display in shop windows

 Assumptions not explicitly related to color, such as the pleasantness of food, may in fact be partially determined by color

 This relationship is not believed to be the result of patient expectations nor a direct effect of color

 In 2000, Glasgow installed blue street lighting in some areas and later reported the real findings of reduced crime in these areas

 The preference for blue and green may be due to the preference for certain habitats that were beneficial in uplifting environments, as explained in the Evolutionary Aesthetics article

 Ghasiram Kotwal is a Marathi play written by Vijay Tendulkar
 yah brahmanon ke garh puna main rojgaar kii talash main gaye ek hindi bhashi brahman ghasiram ke traasadee kii kahani he
 Humiliated by the Brahmins, Ghasiram deals with his daughter's marriage to the Maratha Peshwa Nana Phadnabis and seeks revenge on the Brahmins by acquiring Poona's Kotwali
 kintu naanaa uski beti kii hatya kar detaa he
 Ghasiram cannot take revenge even after wanting it
 ulte naanaa uski hatya karvaa detaa he
 The original Marathi form of the play was first performed on 16 December 1972 in Poona by the Progressive Dramatic Association at the Bharat Natya Mandir
 nirdeshak the dow jabbaar patel
 'ghasiram Kotwal' is not a historical drama
 vah ek naatak he, sirf naatak !naatak sirf naatak hi hota he
 To say in the context of a literary work that it is historical, or mythological, or social, is meaningless
 samay bahut jaldi saamaajik ko aitihaasik or aitihaasik ko puranic bana detaa he
 Yet the content of this play — raw masala — is chronologically chronologically
 itihaas kaa ksheen-sa aadhaar avashya liya gaya he
 However, the drama has nothing to do with history beyond this
 or yah kaccha masala bhi thik usee tarah itihaas se liya gaya he, jis tarah samasamyik jivan-sthitiyon se bhi liya jaataa he
 Maharashtra was ruled by the Peshwas, Nana Phadnavis was the head of the Peshwa, one was a Ghasiram, a Brahmin, a Maratha chieftain, and all those units in their respective circles, like a wooden stick in the flow of time, sometimes moved away, sometimes
 Sometimes touching each other, sometimes colliding, the untimely flow was flowing
 unka yah kaary-karan uchit tha yaa anuchit yaa unka moolbhoot astitv sarthakatayukta tha athwa nahin, isaki khojbin karnaa itihaas kaa shodh karanevaale vyakti kaa kaam ho saktaa he, naatakkaar kaa nahin
 For this reason, i consider 'ghasiram Kotwal' as an historical drama
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ek kinvadanti, ek janashruti ek dantakatha he
 And the legend has its own structure: when we rekindle our reality with the help of imagination, it becomes a legend
 dantakatha gapp bhi he or dekhne kii drushti ho to ek daahak anubhav bhi
 There is no doubt in this that only the creative experience becomes creative literature
 parantu dantakatha kya hoti he or kisi hoti he, isse zyada mahatva kii baat yah he ki ham use kis tarah lete hai, kyonki tabhi ham apni jaanch-padtaal karte hai
 Obviously this is the most difficult task, that is a deep challenge
 use swikaarna apni sahitya-nishtha kaa parichay dena he
 In my view, 'ghasiram Kotwal' indicates a specific social situation
 vah samaaj-sthiti na puraani he or na nai
 Neither is it tied to any geographical boundary, nor from time itself
 vah sthal-kalathit he, isliye ‘ghasiram’ or ‘naanaa fadanvis’ bhi sthal-kalathit hai
 Societies give birth to them, they will continue to give
 kisi bhi yug kaa naatakkaar unase achoota nahin rah paaegaa
 According to his nature, he will sometimes give a grand and gruesome look to the stage, sometimes he will make a dance-musical and present it
 maine jaan-boojhkar duusari reeti apanaai he
 The flexibility of folklore is noted and most useful for the presentation of the legend
 usamen ek paatr vishisht manovriti kaa pratinidhi banakar ubharta he or vah manovriti ekadam pratyaksh tathaa paripurna or amishrit hoti he
 In spite of the superficiality, she remains equally exposed to the general audience
 iske atirikt uskaa apana ek bhadesapan bhi hota he jo bhashaa or tamaasha ke staron par swayamev avateern hota he
 Why would i leave out this peculiarity of Loknatya? lekin rachanaakaar ko apni rachana ke vishay main zyada nahin bolnaa chahie, rachana swayan bolti he or vahi satya he
 Vijay Tendulkar is naatak main ghasiram or naanaa fadanvis kaa vyakti-sangharsh pramukh hote hue bhi tendulkar ne is sangharsh ke saath-saath apni vishisht style main tatkaaleen saamaajik evam rajnatik sthiti kaa maarmik chithran kiya he
 As a result, the difference of time-settlement on the entire state of the ruling class and the general public does not make much difference
 ghasiram har kaal or samaaj main hote hai or har us kaal or us samaaj main use vaisaa banaanevaale or banaakar mauka taak uski hatya karanevaale naanaa fadanvis bhi hote hi hai-vah baat tendulkar ne apane dhang se pratipaadit kii he
 Nana has used Ghasiram very cunningly
 par jab unka rachaa ‘rakshas’ palatakar unheen ko chunauti dene lagata he to naanaa hi use nasht bhi kar detaa he
 From this point of view, this drama is of Nana Fadnavis, no doubt
 ghasiram ek prakaar se ek prasang maatr he jise tendulkar ne apane vaktavy kii abhivyakti kaa ek nimitt, ek saadhan banaaya he
 The portrayal of Nana Fadnavis and the then decadent society in the drama 'ghasiram Kotwal' has to reveal some truth to Tendulkar about the political and special social conditions which have become eternal
 itihaas ke naanaa fadanvis bauddhik prakharata se tadapati hui shakti ke rup main pratishthit hai
 But in this drama, only Ghasiram Kotwal is surrounded by the limits of his personality, his personality is seen as one, his other dimensions are not revealed
 apratyaksh rup se tendulkar ne iskaa bhi usee tarah upyog kiya he jaisaa lok naatakon main hota he jahaan charitra aamtaur par ek yaa do ayamavaale hi hote hai
 That is why a famous Marathi critic has described the play as being very traditional Indian drama-form epithet
 maine apni prastuti main isi baat ko kendriya sutara ke rup main mana he
 While watching the play, it should be unconsciously descending in the minds of the audience that the whole society is collapsing, it is getting lost
 yah baat apratyaksh nahin honi chahie
 As the composition of this play was completely new to Marathi theater, i was very happy to express its intended meaning in the desired indirect way
 kisi pratishthit naatakkaar ne lokanaty ke swaroop main koi naatak pehle dhaala nahin tha, isliye main lokanataka ke lacheele lochapurna shilpatantra kaa upyog kai prakaar se khulkar kar sakaa
 The imagery of the men’s swinging curtains is wonderful for the theater
 is naatak kii sabase badi yukti bhi yahi he
 Twelve Brahmins handle the narrative as a chorus
 aavashyaktaanusaar taatkaalik ikhari bhoomikaaye bhi nibhaate hai
 This curtain divides into two sections and in a moment, is transformed into many components of society, units
 ghasiram ko kotwaal ke rup main sthapit karanevaala yahi paradaa ghasiram ke vadh ke samay rusht brahmanon ke rup main rangamanch par dikhta he
 The same screen which is sung by Shri Gajraj Nartan, connects his relationship with Lokanatya through ganapati-vandana
 kalakaar or bhoomika ke bich ek sookshm or tar sambandh lokanaty kii visheshta he
 i did not tie my performance to any particular folk style but have mixed use of pure Marathi folk arts like Dashavatar, Bharuad, Khela, Tamasha, Powada, Wadhyamurali, Kirtan etc
 saraswati, lakshmi, ganpati dwaara dashavathari armbh hota he
 i have tried to show the equanimity in these different styles by using the Thal of Aarti of this time only for black vaccines during Kirtan
 brahman-veshdhari kalakaar prekshagrih se hokar rangamanch par aate hai
 In this way, the folklore form of performance becomes more and more communicated to the mental level of the audience due to the intimacy arising
 naatak ke pehle ank kii gati duusare ank kii apeksha dhimi he
 It is only natural to take time to establish a historical person in the external form of folk theater because it is an entirely new experience
 naanaa fadanvis sareekhe itihaas-purush kaa rangamanch par nrity-talbaddh hokar aana marathi darshak ke liye nishchay hi dhakka pahunchaanevaala anubhav tha
 Therefore, the viewer had to be convinced that the character of this play, Nana Phadnavis, is merely a folk character - not the authentic, complete personality of the historical plays
 kuch samikshakon kii drushti main yah baat bahut dhime-dhime sthapit hui
 But i felt that the direction of Ghansiram's use of Nana to get the place of Nana in it and to get the cotwali in it by directing the hollow society, etc
 should have been very detailed
 duusare ank kii gati tej thi
 Ghasiram, the oppressor of Poona's Brahmins, his vengeance, the transformation of Ghasiram into a demon due to that vengeance, etc
 is established by going to the scene of fire test
 naanaa ke vivaah se lekar gauri kii mrityu tak ghasiram bahut baichaiyn he lekin uski bechaini naradham kii he
 He did not want to slay the Brahmins in the cell, but the murder of Naradham Ghasiram is the result of his indirect crime - this contradiction of destiny has been effectively depicted by Tendulkar
 niyati kaa aisa pratishodh anek aitihaasik khalnaayakon ke prasang main miltaa he
 After Ghasiram's assassination, Nana's clever speech is full of levity and diplomacy, producing a unique impression of his dominance and Nana Fadnavis is again at the center of the play
 is naatak kaa angrej paatr ek darshak maatr he
 At the end of the play, he is standing in the lighthouse to the left at the rear post
 neeche ghasiram kii hatya ke baad samuhik utsav ho rahaa he
 This is the premonition of upcoming history of Poona
