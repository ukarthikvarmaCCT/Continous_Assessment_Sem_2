 In this, it was believed that light comes out of the illuminated object in the form of very fine and fast particles
 ye kanikas saadhaaran dravya kii nahin hotin, kyonki inamen bhaar bilkul nahin hota
 The difference in light corpuscles of different colors is only their expansion: the corpuscles of red light are larger and violet smaller

 According to direct experience, whenever light falls on the surface of two substances, its fraction gets reflected and enters into some other substance
 is yogapadik paravartan or apvartan ke liye aavashyak he ki kuch prakaash kanikaon par to parakarshan bal lage or kuch par archeshan
 How can this be possible? To overcome this objection, Newton created the hypothesis that a kind of tour comes from publishers, which sometimes attracts and sometimes attracts

 But the interpretation of the events of interference and polarization was not possible through this theory

 ghirani ek gol rambh he, jisase mashin kii shakti ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak le jaaya jaataa he
 If a lathe is to be run from the engine, then by putting a strap on the engine pulley and the lathe pulley, you run the lathe with the power of the engine
 ghirani ke vyas se hi mashiinon kii gati ko kam yaa zyada kiya ja saktaa he
 The power of machines can be moved from one place to another without any loss of teeth, but where there is more distance in these places, these cycles cannot be used

 yadi ingine se kisi duusari mashin ko chalaaya ja rahaa he, to ingine kii ghirani chalaanevaali ghirani kehalaaegi or mashin kii ghirani chalanevaali ghirani hogi
 The pulleys are usually of cast iron, the middle part of which is joined by the arms of the pulley
 ye baaju sankhya main chaar se lekar chha: tak hote hai
 The spindle is tightened by inserting it into the hole in the middle part of the pulley
 ghirani ke har bhaag kii naap aisi rakhi jaati he ki vah usapar padanevaale har bal ko sahan kar sake
 The recent width of the pulley is kept slightly higher than the width of the leash
 iske haal par do prakar ke bal honge, ek to patte ke khinchaav ke kaaran or doosraa iske ghoomane ke kaaran
 It has been observed that the speed of a recent pulley of a square inch passage should exceed 100 feet per second
 isaliye dhalwaan lohe kii ghirani ko is gati se adhik tej nahin chalaaya jaataa
 Where more speed is required, a pulley is made by mixing raw and cast iron
 iskaa dhyaan rahe ki adhik gati se chalanevaali ghiraniyon ko dhaala nahin jaataa, balki iske vibhinn bhaagon ko alag banaakar pechon dwaara joda jaataa he
 The weight of this type of pulley is often not too much and there is not much fear of breaking it
 ghirani banane main iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uskaa aakarshanakendra thik bich main ho
 If this is not done, it will cause oscillation as the axle rotates and the axle will be weighed
 isaliye ghirani ko dhuree par chadhaakar iskaa tolan jaanch liya jaataa he
 To check this, the spindle is placed at the bases from both sides
 yadi dhuree har sthaan par rukii rahe or ghume nahin, to iskaa tolan thik hoga or agar yah kisi ore gum jaay to isse pataa chalegaa ki ghirani ek ore se baari he
 The weight is corrected by tying the same weight on the other side of which the pulley is heavy
 bhinn bhinn prakaar kii ghiraniyon kaa vivaran neeche diya ja rahaa he: This pulley is made by mixing two or more pulleys of different diameters
 pad ghirani ko ek hi bhaag main dhaala jaataa he
 They are used in the same place where both the running and running pulleys and the speed of the moving machine need to be changed
 in ghiraniyon ko is prakaar lagaaya jaataa he ki ek ghirani kii choti ghirani duusare kii badi ghirani ke saamne ho
 This does not make any difference in the length of the lease by changing the lease from one post to another, so the length of the lease is taken after taking the diameters of both the houses before mounting it on the pulley
 ghirani par jo patta chadhaaya jaataa he, usase chalanevaali mashin kii disha bhi badali jaati he
 If both sides of the lease are parallel to it, the direction of rotation of the pulley rod will be the same as that of the pulley pulley
 agar is disha ko badalanaa he, to patte ke baajuon ko ek duusare par chadhaakar ghirani par chadhaaya jaataa he
 This pulley is usually small in size and is used to maintain the tension of the lease properly
 isaki dhuree par ek skanda lagaakar patte par chhod diya jaataa he or skanda ke bal ke kaaran yah ghirani patte kaa dabaae rakhti he
 If the tension of the leash decreases while walking, then due to the pressure of the skand the rider encircles the leash, which does not reduce the stress
 isaliye savaar ghirani lagbhag har patte par lagaai jaati he
 These two pulleys are placed on the axles running close together and they both have equal diameter
 inamen pehali ghirani dhuree par kasi hui hoti he or mashiinon ke chalaane ke kaam aati he
 The second loose pulley is neither rotated by the rotation of the spindle nor does the spindle rotate due to its rotation
 dhili ghirani lagane kaa matlab keval yah hota he ki jab chalanevaali ghirani se patte ko dhili ghirani par laayaa jaataa he to dhuree to gumti rahati he, magar kasi hui chalanevaali mashin ruk jaati he
 Therefore, the machine which is running from this axis can be stopped without stopping
 jab is mashin ko phir chalaanaa ho to patte ko sthir ghirani par le aayaa jaataa he
 These pulleys are shaped like v and are used where ropes are used to carry power
 kuch sthanon par shakti itani zyada hoti he ki use chamade ke patton se nahin le jaaya ja saktaa
 Therefore many ropes are mixed and mounted on such pulleys
 ye rasse soot ke bhi hote hai or lohe ke taron ke bhi
 Another advantage of these ropes is that while walking, they do not slip on the pulleys as much as the leather strap slips
 isse shakti kii haani nahin hoti
 If the moving axles are not parallel, the strap will slip from the pulleys
 isko rokane ke liye maarg ghirani kaa upyog hota he
 This pulley is placed in such a way that the axle of the drive pulley and the drive pulley are in a plane and the axis of the pulley pulley and pulley pulley are in a plane

 bina pratirupon kaa aashray liye samtal jyamitiya kaa gyaan ek prakaar se mastishk ko samatleey kar detaa he or unamem aisi vichaardhaara paidaa kar detaa he ki aage chalakar ganit main trivimeetiya jyamiti kaa samajhnaa uske liye durghat ho jaataa he
 Some early versions of Euclid drew sketches that helped to understand the facts of geometry by cutting and folding them, and in 1752, Couley's New and Methodical Explanations of the Elementals of Geometry were used to create various patterns in cardboard
 Cut pieces were also imminent
 herbert spencer jaise pratibhavan vichaarak or darshanik ne apane pita ko likhe ek patr main praturup ke laabhon kii charchaa kii thi
 As already stated, the facts of geometry are perceptible by models
 yahi nahin, praaia: unki sahaayta se nae ganitiya tathyon ko chaatr swayan gyaat kar saktaa he
 For example, by cutting triangles of different sides of the same circumference with the same cardboard and weighing them, the student can discover the fact that equilateral triangles have the largest area of the given perimeter triangles, similarly they can also find that the given surface The tetrahedron is of the largest volume in the quadrilaterals of the area
 kuch manoranjak tiryakchhin sambahu falkon ke prati rup banane kii vidhi yah he : kisi dafti yaa kade kaagaj par ek sam shadbhuj khinche or isaki prayek bhujaa par aisa hi shadbhuj khinche
 The boundary of the area surrounded by these seven conspiracies has 18 arms
 inke anudish tej chaaku yaa blade se kaat kar is kshetra ko alag kar le
 Then cut the middle hexagon from this area and separate it
 ab har jodi shadbhujon kii ubhaynishth koron main se paanch ko bheetar se aadhi dur tak kaat den or shesh ardhbhag main shikan bana den
 Cut off the sixth common core
 ab yadi is kati hui korwale shadbhujon ko ek duusare ke upar sampati kar diya jaay to bich main sampanchabhujakar chhidr milegaa
 a square hole will be found if the two hexes of such end are coincident with the two hexes at the other end
 yadi sire ke teen shadbhujon ko sampati kar diya jaay to sambahu tribhujaakar chhidr milegaa
 Adding the three adjacent contiguous crosses to the free cores will also give an equilateral triangular hole
 yadi tribhujaakar chhidravale valay ke ek sire par kataa hua shadbhuj baitha diya jaay to aisa tiryakchhin samachatushfalak milegaa
 On which four small equal triangles have been cut from all the four heads
 vargakar chhidravale do valyon ko is prakaar rakhane par ki vargakar chhidr ke sanmukhwale bhaag sampati ho jaayan, vah tiryakchhin ashtafalak banataa he jo sam ashtafalak ke shirshon se samaan vargadharawale soochistambh kaatane par miltaa he
 Placing the 12 rings with pentagonals in such a way that they become hexagonal, form an oblique rhombus with its head truncated bordered
 tiryakchhin ashtafalkon ko sataakar avkaash ko usee prakaar bharaa ja saktaa he jaise iton se
 In this case, the hexagon becomes the face of a bifurcation ie crooked polyhedron with four vertices at each vertex
 isi prakaar tiryakchhin chatushfalkon se jo kutil bahufalak banataa he uske prayek sheersh par chah shadbhuj rahete he in do ke atirikt ek or prakaar kaa kutil bahufalak he jiske prayek sheersh par chah varg rahete hai
 It is a polyhedron with six squares on each head
 yah bahufalak aise ghanavalyon se ban saktaa he jinamein do sammukh falak na hon
 This polyhedron may be surrounded
 in teenon kutil bahufalkon ke paanch platoneey thoson kii bhanti falak sambhuj or kone samaan hote hai
 The purpose of mathematical models is not to give the practitioners the help, the only aid is to understand them and to suggest new directions of discovery
 isaliye unka itnaa yatharth hona aavashyak nahin jitna ki lekhachitron or gananachitron kaa
 Even then, the models should be made as carefully as possible and from the material
 varnanaatmak rekhganit, yathadarshan aadi ke adhyayan ke liye kabjon se jude hue samatalon kii jodi or kabhi kabhi sandarbh ke liye tisare samtal kaa diya rahanaa, ek laabhadaayak yukti he
 If the holes in such surrounded planets are studied the status quo of problems and clarification of problems of vertical projection
 anek samasyaon kaa spashtikaran kashtha ke thos pratirupon kii kaat se ho jaataa he
 a quick example of this is to divide the cube into six equal quadrants such that no new vertices are formed

 Each pane is a right angled triangle

 In fact, this is how the formula 3+ b3 + 3a2b +3bk2 is demonstrated
 shankav ganit kaa adhyayan, jo adhikansh vaishleshik vidhi se kiya jaataa he, praturup ke prayog dwaara saral ore subodh ho jaataa he
 Different cuts of only one perpendicular circular cone are shown in this pattern
 yadi katwala samtal aadhaar ke samaantar he to kaat vrutt he, yadi samtal aadhaar se thodaa jhukaa he, arthath aksh se ardhashirsh kone kii apeksha bada kone banataa he, to kaat dirghavritt hai, yadi samtal kisi janak rekha ke samaantar he to kaat paravalay he or yadi samtal aksh se ardhashirsh kone kii apeksha chota kone banaata he to kaat aparivalay kii ek shakha he 
 If two spheres within the cone and make a sphere touching these spheres can be easily established by a wire equal to the tangent of these spheres, the fact that the tangents of the spheres from the plane are the nuclei of the ellipse that is the cone

 Symmetric solids and circumferences can be drawn on the surface lathe
 jo prishth aksh ke saapeksh samamit nahin he unka bhi nirmaan samuchit kharad main, utkendre gati se chalanevaale chak lagaakar, kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, models can be made of high degree of precision, as machine work can be done with microscopic measurements
 bahut se prishthon ke praturup mude hue sthaayee taron se unke mukhya kaat pradarshit kar banaae ja sakate hai, kintu kitne hi chakkardaar namya praturup, chhadon or pattiyon main siron par keelein or kabje jadkar, banaae ja sakate hai
 In this way, such a mechanism can be done, in which continuous pages can be obtained to make reference pages
 ruju rekhaon dwaara janan honevaale, arthath rekhaj prishthon ke praturup, saraltapurvak banaae ja sakate hai, kyonki janakon ko kramik taane hue dorkon se nirupati kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, do two equidistant holes in two identical circular circles and tighten them on the same axis in such a way that one is fixed and rotated on the other axis
 ab mandalkon ke sangat chhidron main se dorak piroe
 The fork is attached to the top hole and the weight is placed on the lower end, so that the fork is straight
 jab mandalkon main se dorak swatantraapurvak latakate hai tab dorkon se belan kaa prishth banataa he
 When rotating a mandala, the circles from the dorsals form a hyperbola and a bivariate in a marginal state
 doosraa udhaaharan aise praturup kaa he jisase samtal se aarambh kar kramash: atiparavalayik paravalayaj ke sabhi rup or ant main dwisamtal banaae ja sakate hai
 To make this model, make equidistant holes in two rods
 ek chad ko sthir tathaa duusari ko ek aise aksh se parit ghurnansheel rakhen, jo swayan bhi sthir chad se vibhinn konon par jhuk saken
 Thread the thread through the hole pair
 ye prishthon ke janak hai
 Rotating rotating rods yield different pages
 yah baat dhyaan dene kii he ki ati paravalayik paravalayaj dhaatu kii samtal chadar ko anthne or modane se nahin banataa
 Pages such as cylinders and cones, which can be made from a plane, are called inaugurated
 vyavrutt vakron ke praturup yaa to taron ko samuchit rup se modakar yaa dorkon se unke spershiyon ko nirupit kar banaae ja sakate hai
 The tangents generate an inverted page

 After this, he voluntarily accepted the deportation
 unhone kasam khai ki jab tak spain main phir se republic kii sthapana nahin ho jaati, vah spain nahin lautenge
 Picasso earned immense wealth from painting
 sambhavat: aaj tak kisi bhi kalakaar yaa sahityakar ko apni rachanakritiyon se itani aay nahin hui hogi
 While he used to charge maximum value of his paintings from private individuals, he presented his paintings to many museums free of cost

 You should see the move 2 Always buy below, should sell above and do not play without selling goods
 Always take the price at 5% of the highest rate
 Suppose the price of a share goes up to Rs
 1000, then wait for it to come up to Rs
 50
 Should come Will come down in 1 year, will change in 3 years to 5 years; 95% will fall in 1 year
 When the election starts, the market starts changing after the elections
 In about 3 years and 10 months, the market will be the highest

 You should invest 10% of your deposit capital in this market
 Not much, do not consider this business, this is a speculative, how does this speculative work? i tell you, on the computer, you see buyers and sellers on both sides, they are mostly fake
 And you keep buying and selling amongst each other, you think in the market The fast is slowing down while it is waiting
 When you buy or sell, the people will run contrary to the work that they will do in abundance, that is, the public plays the main role in bringing speed
 Their effort is, according to them, wherever the public thinks, the victory should be the same
 Because the people are not the same, they are the only things of the same plate
 Go against the work being done in abundance in the market
 At the rate at which 50% of the purchase is made, only when the second purchase is made, double the goods like 1 share price 50 rupees = 50 rupees = 2 share prices 25 rupees = 50 rupees = 4 share prices 12 rupees 50 paise = 50 rupees = 8 share prices 6 rupees 25 paise = 50 rupees = 16 share prices 3 rupees 15 pes = 50 rupees = 50 rupees = 32 share price 1 rupee 60 pes = 50 rupees, in this way you have 63 shares for Rs 300, the price of Rs 50 is almost Rs 6, you will never be beaten
 Will eat as trumped | First to come down from the maximum price of Rs 2300 in gold Must purchase Like === Maximum Price = 16040 -2300 = 13740 First Purchase
 Price should be doubled for second purchase at price 13740-2300 = 11440
 Price should be taken for the third purchase at the price 11440-2300 = 9140
 The goods should be bought 8 times at the price 9140-2300 = 6840
 The price should be 16 times the price to buy the fifth at 6840-2300 = 4540
 The same should be purchased in silver at a difference of Rs
 3000
 The price of gold and silver is 30 years, 10 years will be changed, 20 years will remain below copper glass gin nickel etc
 The gait is 7 to 8 years old
 No matter how expensive it will be from the time of election, you will definitely come back at 33% price
 No one has the magic of magic, never work at the behest of anyone
 If you are not aware of this market, then you would not have earned it yourself
