 He said that the best thing for him was that the Netflix people wanted to make it in Hindi and not in English, because according to him "speaking English can seem like a fake at times
 " iske baad motwani ne lekhak varun grover ke saath upanyaas ke anukulan par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya, or lekhan ko "sabase badi chunauti" ke rup main varnit kiya
 Motwani said that the medium of the digital series was "liberating" for him, as he was now able to tell even stories that were not required to be told "in two-and-a-half-hour intervals, and after putting in three songs

 sant peter kaa dehanth rome main hua tha jisase prarambh hi se rome ke bishap ko carch kaa paramadhyaksh mana jane laga
 The unity of this church could not remain intact due to many reasons
 pehle praachya carch rome se alag ho gaye
 Later Protestant religion emerged which resulted in the denial of the authority of the Bishop of Rome by a significant portion of the Western Church

 ek baar hastinapur naresh dushyant akhet khilne van main gayi
 The forest where he went for hunting was the ashram of Kanva Rishi
 kanv rishi ke darshan karne ke liye maharaj dushyant unke ashram pahunch gayi
 On calling, a very lavish girl left the ashram and said, “O Rajan! Maharishi has gone on pilgrimage, but you are welcome in this ashram
 ” us kanya ko dekh kar maharaj dushyant ne poocha, “balike! aap koun hai?” balika ne kaha, “meraa naam shakuntala he or main kanv rishi kii putree hoon
 Hearing that girl, Maharaja Dushyant said in surprise, "maharishi is a born Brahmachari then how are you his daughter?" In response to his question, Shakuntala said, "actually my parents are Maneka and Vishwamitra
 meri mata ne mere janm hote hi mujhe van main chhod diya tha jahaan par shakunth naamak pakshi ne meri raksha kii
 That is why my name was Shakuntala
 uske baad kanv rishi kii drushti mujh par padi or ve mujhe apane ashram main le aaye
 He was the one who fed me
 janm dene vaala, poshan karne vaala tathaa ann dene vaala – ye teenon hi pita kahe jate hai
 In this way Kanva Rishi became my father
 ” Hearing Shakuntala's words, Maharaj Dushyant said, "shakuntale! You are a Kshatriya girl
 tumhaare soundarya ko dekh kar main apana hriday tumhen arpit kar chukaa hoon
 If you have no objection, then i want to marry you
 ” shakuntala bhi maharaj dushyant par mohit ho chuki thi, atah usne apni sweekruti pradaan kar di
 Both got married to Gandharva
 kuch kaal maharaj dushyant ne shakuntala ke saath vihaar karte huye van main hi vyateet kiya
 Then one day he said to Shakuntala, "dear! Now i have to leave Hastinapur to see my kingdom
 maharishi kanv ke tirth yatra se laut aane par main tumhen yahan se vidaa kara kar apane rajbhavan main le jaaungaa
 Saying so, Maharaj gave Shakuntala his gold ring as a token of his love and went to Hastinapur
 ek din uske ashram main durvasa rishi padhaare
 Shakuntala did not even know of his arrival due to being absorbed against Maharaja Dushyant and did not welcome Durvasa Rishi properly
 durvasa rishi ne ise apana apmaan samajha or krodhit ho kar bole, “balike! main tuje shaap detaa hoon ki jis kisi ke dhyaan main leen hokar tuune meraa niraadar kiya he, vah tuje bhul jaayegaa
 Hearing the curse of Durvasa Rishi, Shakuntala's attention was broken and she fell at his feet and started praying for forgiveness
 shakuntala ke kshamaa prarthana se dravit ho kar durvasa rishi ne kaha, “acha yadi tere paas uskaa koi prem chinh hoga to us chinh ko dekh use teri smriti ho aayegi
 " maharaj dushyant ke sahavaas se shakuntala garbhvatee ho gai thi
 After some time Kanva Rishi returned from pilgrimage, then Shakuntala told him about his Gandharva marriage with Maharaj Dushyant
 is par maharishi kanv ne kaha, “putree! vivaahit kanya kaa pita ke ghar main rahanaa uchit nahin he
 Now your husband's house is your home
 ” itnaa kah kar maharishi ne shakuntala ko apane shishyon ke saath hastinapur bhijwa diya
 While walking in a lake on the way, the ring of Shakuntala given by King Dushyant, which was a love sign, fell in the lake itself
 us anguthi ko ek machhlee nigal gai
 Upon reaching King Dushyant, the disciples of Kanva Rishi stood Shakuntala in front of him and said, "maharaj! Shakuntala is your wife, you accept it
 ” maharaj to durvasa rishi ke shaap ke kaaran shakuntala ko vismrit kar chuke the
 Therefore, he did not accept Shakuntala and started attacking him
 shakuntala kaa apmaan hote hi akaash main joro kii bijli kadak uthi or sab ke saamne uski mata menka use uthaa le gai
 The fish, which swallowed Shakuntala's ring, got caught in a fisherman's net one day
 jab machuaare ne use kaata to uske pet anguthi nikali
 The fisherman sent the ring to Maharaja Dushyant as an offering
 anguthi ko dekhte hi maharaj ko shakuntala kaa samaran ho aayaa or ve apane krity par pashchaatap karne lage
 Maharaj found Shakuntala very much but did not find her

 In the ashram, a handsome boy was playing with a fierce lion
 menka ne shakuntala ko kashyap rishi ke paas laakar choda tha tathaa vah balak shakuntala kaa hi putr tha
 On seeing that child, a feeling of love rose in the heart of Maharaj
 ve use god main uthaane ke liye aage bade to shakuntala kii sakhi chilla uthi, “he bhadra purush! aap is balak ko na chhuyen anyathaa uski bhujaa main bandhaa kaala doraa saanp ban kar aapako das legaa
 On hearing this, Dushyant could not stop himself and lifted the child in his lap
 ab sakhi ne aashcharya se dekha ki balak ke bhujaa main bandhaa kaala ganda prithvi par gir gaya he
 Sakhi knew that whenever his father would take the child in his lap, that black thread would fall to the earth
 sakhi ne prasann ho kar samast vrutant shakuntala ko sunaaya
 Shakuntala Maharaj came to Dushyant
 maharaj ne shakuntala ko pahchaan liya
 He prayed forgiveness to Shakuntala for his act and took the permission of Rishi Kashyapa and brought him along with his son to Hastinapur
 maharaj dushyant or shakuntala ke us putr kaa naam bharat tha

 kathakaha jaataa he ki ek baar indralok par 'vritrasur' naamak rakshas ne adhikaar kar liya tathaa indra sahit devataaon ko devloak se nikaal diya

 Indra's hesitation devraj indra maharishi dadhichi ke paas janaa nahin chaahate the, kyonki indra ne ek baar dadhichi kaa apmaan kiya tha, jiske kaaran ve dadhichi ke paas jane se kataraa rahe the
 It is believed that Maharishi Dadhichi was the only one who had knowledge of Brahmanism
 maharishi maatr vishisht vyakti ko hi is vidya kaa gyaan dena chaahate the, lekin indra brahm vidya praapt karne ke param icchhuk the
 Indra was not eligible for this education in Dadhichi's view
 isliye unhone indra ko is vidya ko dene se manaa kar diya
 On Dadhichi's refusal, Indra refused to give him this lesson to anyone else and said- "if you do this, i will tear your head off"
 maharishi ne kaha ki- "yadi unhen koi yogya vyakti milegaa to ve avashya hi brahm vidya use pradaan karenge
 "after some time, Ashwini Kumar reached Maharishi Dadhichi from Indraloka to take up theology
 dadhichi ko ashvinikumar brahm vidya paane ke yogya lage

 Indra expelled the Ashwini Kumaras from Indralok

 He was very hesitant for this task
 dadhichi dwaara asthiyon kaa daan The atrocities of the Vritrasura demon on Devlok were increasing day by day
 vah devataaon ko bhaanti-bhaanti se pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 Ultimately, Devraj Indra had to go to the shelter of Maharishi Dadhichi along with the gods to protect Indraloka and for the good of the gods and to save his throne
 maharishi dadhichi ne indra ko puraa sammaan diya tathaa ashram aane kaa kaaran poocha
 Indra narrated his grief to Maharishi and Dadhichi said- "what can i do to protect Devlok
" " devataaon ne unhen brahma, vishnu va mahesh kii kahin hui baaten bataayin tathaa unki asthiyon kaa daan maanga
 Maharishi Dadhichi accepted the donation of his ashes without hesitation
 unhone samadhi lagaai or apni deh tyaag di
 His wife was not in the ashram at that time
 ab devataaon ke samaksh ye samasya ai ki maharishi dadhichi ke sharir ke maans ko koun utaare
 As soon as this work came to mind, all the gods were frightened
 tab indra ne kamdhenu gaay ko bulaayaa or use maharishi ke sharir se maance utaarne ko kaha
 Kamdhenu licked the flesh of Maharishi's body with his tongue
 ab keval asthiyon kaa pinjar rah gaya tha
 Stubbornness maharishi dadhichi ne to apni deh devataao kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag di, lekin jab unki patni 'gabhastini' waapas ashram main ai to apane pati kii deh ko dekhakar vilaap karne lagi tathaa sati hone kii jid karne lagi
 Then the gods refused her a lot, because she was pregnant
 devataaon ne unhen apane vansh ke liye sati na hone kii salaah di
 But she did not listen
 tab sabhi ne unhen apane garbh ko devataaon ko saunpane kaa nivedan kiya
 At this Gabbathini agreed and surrendered her womb to the Gods and became Sati herself
 devataaon ne gabhastini ke garbh ko bachaane ke liye pipal ko uskaa laalan-paalan karne kaa daayitv saunpa
 After some time, she was born and conceived, and because of the upbringing by Peepal, she was named 'piplad'

 Dr
 Kapil Dev Dwivedi has discussed in detail about the nature of syntax
 unka mat is prakaar haih- The difference between phraseology and syntax is that creation of terms is discussed in the post-science
 atah usamen pad vibhaajan, kaarak, vibhakti, vachan, ling, kaal, purush aadi ke bodhak shabd kis prakaar banate hai, is par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Syntax is next to that
 isamen purvakt vidhi se bane hue padon kaa kahan, kis prakaar se rakhane se arth main kya antar hota he, aadi vishyon kaa vivechan he
 Sound is a building element
 jaise mitti, kapaas aadi; pad bane hue ve tatva hai, jinka upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jaise- eent, vastra aadi; vaakya vah rup he, jo vaastavik rup main prayog main aata he, jaise- makaan, sile vastra aadi
 If the verse is a brick then the sentence is a house or building
 tattvik drushti se dhwani, pad or vaakya main moulik antar he
 Voice is basically related to pronunciation
 yaa shaareerik vyapaar se utpann hoti he, atah dhwani main mukhyatya shaareerik vyapaar pradhan he
 The verse coordinates both sound and meaning
 dhwani shaareerik paksh he or sarthakata maansik paksh he
 The coordination of both physical and mental elements in the verse makes it suitable for use in a sentence
 sarthakata kaa sambandh vichaar se he
 Thought is the work of the mind, so there is mental business in the post
 vaakya main vichaar, vichaaron kaa samanvay, sarthak evam samanvit rup main abhivyakti, ye sabhi kaary vichaar or chintan se sambhddha he, atah maansik kaary he
 The mental or psychological aspect is important in a sentence
 vichaaron kii purna abhivyakti vaakya se hoti he, atah vaakya hi bhashaa kaa sookshmatam sarthak ikai mana jaataa he

 Then the nymphs went to heaven
 brahman ne somvaaron kaa vrath kar ke rogamukt hokar jivan vyateet kiya
 After a few days when Parvati ji came to know, Parvati ji asked Karan to get rid of her disease

 There, the queen told the whole thing with the request of the priest and on hearing the priest said that you have cursed Shiva
 rani ne vinati karke puchha to pujarine iske nidaan kaa upaay bataaya or somvaar vrath kii bidhi bataai
 The queen completed her fast with her mind and Shiva's cremation changed the mind of the king on the seventeenth Monday
 raja ne rani ko dhudhane doot bheje
 After finding out the king sent a call but the priest said send the king himself
 isapar raja ne vichaar kiya or swayan pahuche
 Arrived at the court with the queen and gave her place

 From around the 13th century onwards, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, "sant Mat" was a loosely connected group of gurus that gained much fame
 dharm brahm vigyaan ke taur par unki shikshaaon kii visheshta yah he ki ve antarmukhi or prem bhakthi ke ek divine siddhant se jude hai or saamaajik rup se ve ek samtawadi gunon vaale siddhant se jude hai jo hindu dharm kii jati pratha ke viruddh he or hindu - muslim ke antar ke bhi viruddh he
 The saint tradition can be broadly divided into two groups: Punjab, the northern group of saints of the region who expressed themselves mainly in colloquial Hindi and the southern group whose language is ancient Marathi and is represented by Namdev and other saints from Maharashtra
 
 'sant mat' kaa arth he - 'santon kaa maarg', 'satya kaa maarg', 'sahi or ashaavadi path' yaa 'santon kii raay'
 'sant' shabd sanskrit kii dhaatu 'sad' se bana he or kai prakaar se prayog haa he 
 iskaa mul arth he 'satya jaanane vaala' yaa 'jisane antim satya anubhav kar liya ho
 The meaning of the word "saint" is generally taken from a good person but its special meaning is taken only from the saint poets of medieval India
 sant mat andolan ekarup nahin tha or isamen santon kaa apana saamaajik-dharmik vyavhaar shaamil tha jo ki hajaar varsh pehle bhagavadgita main varnit bhakthi par aadhaarit tha
 He shared some of his own traditions with each other and followers of the traditions he challenged
 is prakaar sant mat vishisht dharmik parampara ke bajaay aadhyatmik vyaktitvon kaa aisa vividhtapurna samooh prathit hota he jo ek saamaanya aadhyatmik mul ko sweekaar karata he
 The boundaries of this movement were probably not sectarian and it did not even have Brahmin concepts of caste and method of worship

 The tradition of Ramanandi monks tells the story of Ramananda differently by other saints and later Sikhs
 itani jaankaree milti he ki ramanand ne sabhi jatiyon se shishy sweekaar kiye, yah ek aisa tathy he jiskaa roodhiwaadee hinduon ne us samay virodh kiya tha
 The followers of Sant Mat believe that Ramananda's disciples prepared the first generation of saints
 in santon ne ek sankruti kaa vikaas kiya jo samaaj main haashie par pade manushyon ke nikat thi jisamen mahilaayein, dalit, achhut or atishudra shaamil the
 Some of the more famous saints include Namdev, Kabir, Nanak, Surdas, Meera Bai, Tulsidas and Tukaram
 
 The tradition of saints has been non-denominational, although many saint poets are believed to have established their sects
 inamen se kaiyon ke naam ke saath sant judaa he lekin unke shishyon ne aage chal kar kabir panth, dadu panth, dariyaa panth, advait mat, aadhyatmikta kaa vigyaan or radhaswami jaise panth chalaae
 Only a minority of religious Hindus have formally followed the saintly faith
 parantu is parampara kaa sabhi sampradaayon or jatiyon par bahut prabhaav pada he
 The hymns of bygone saints like Meera Bai are widely heard in Hindu castes in India and around the world

 Julius J
 Lipner has asserted that the religious teachings of saints have uplifted the lives of many Hindus and called her a freedom fighter
 sant mat parampara main jinda guru ko mahatv diya jaataa he jise satguru yaa 'purna guru' jaise sammaan suchak shabdon ke saath sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 There is believed to be a lot of similarity between medieval Sufi poets such as Jalal al-din Mohammed Rumi and Sindhi poets and saintly poets
 uttar bharat kaa radhaswami andolan apane aap ko santamat panrapara or dharmik prayaas kaa mukhya nidhaan maanata he or swayan ko sant parampara ke jivit avatar kii bhaanti prastut karata he
 The most notable is the Radhaswami Satsang Beas, which is situated on the banks of the Beas River and whose current living Guru is Gurinder Singh
