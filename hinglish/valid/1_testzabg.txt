 When the speed of a chemical reaction increases with the mere presence of a substance, it is called catalysis
 jis padaarth kii upasthiti se abhikriya kii gati batch jaati he use utprerak kehete hai
 The catalyst does not participate in the reaction, only affecting the speed of action
 audyogic rup se mahatvapurn rasayanon ke nirmaan main utprerakon kii bahut badi bhoomika he, kyonki inke prayog se abhikriya kii gati batch jaati he jisase anek prakaar se aarthik laabh hota he or utpaadan tej hota he
 Therefore, a lot of money and human labor is engaged in research in the field of catalysis
 sarvapratham san 1835 main, berjilius ne kuch rasinic kriyaaon kii or dhyaan aakrisht kiya jinamein katipay bahm padaartho kii upasthiti main kriya kii gati to teevr ho jaati thi kintu bahm padaarth us kriya main koi bhaag nahin letaa tha
 For example, if the sugar is heated in the presence of acids, it is quickly converted into glucose and fructose
 is kriya main amla koi bhaag nahin letaa
 It can be reused
 berjilius ne is kriya ko "utpreran" kii sangya di tathaa un padaartho ko "utprerak" ke naam se pukaara jinaki upasthiti main kriya veg se hone lagati he
 Ostwald defined catalytic materials as: "" a catalyst is a substance that changes the velocity of a chemical reaction, but remains unchanged at the end of the action itself, so it can be reused
 
 adhikansh kriyaaon main utprerak pratikriya kii gati ko badha detaa he
 Such catalysts are called positive catalysts; But there are also catalysts which slow down the speed of chemical reaction
 aise utprerak rinatmak utprerak kehalaate hai
 The main features of catalysis are: praaia: sabhi utprerit kriyaaon ko do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he: samaavyavi utprerit kriyaayein ; vishmavyavo utprerit kriyaayein 
 In these actions, catalyst, repellent and byproduct are all present in the same state
 udhaahranrth, salfurik amla banane kii veshm vidhi main sulfur diaksaide, bhaap tathaa oxijan ke sanyog se salfurik amla banataa he tathaa nitric oxide dwaara yah kriya utprerit hoti he
 In this action, reagents, catalysts and byproducts remain in this gaseous state
 in kriyaaon main utprerak, pratikarmak tathaa pratifal vibhinn avasthaaon main upasthit rahete hai
 As such, ferric oxide catalyzes the combination of nitrogen and hydrogen in the Haber-method of making ammonia
 sookshm nikal kii upasthiti main vanaspatik telon kaa hydrogenikaran is prakaar kii kriyaaon kaa ek anya udhaaharan he
 Some substances do not affect the velocity of chemical action by their presence, but some affect the action of other catalysts
 inamen se un padaartho kii, jo utprerakon kii kriyasheeltaa ko badha dete hai, utprerakavardhak tathaa un padaartho ko, jo utprerakon kii kriyasheeltaa kam kar dete hai, utprerakavirohi yaa utprerak vish kehete hai
 Self-catalysts - Some reactions are also known in which a substance produced by the reaction acts as a catalyst for the reaction
 udaahranarth, ethil acetate ke jalavichedan main jo aseetic amla praapt hota he, vahi aster ke jalavichedan kii kriya ko utprerit karata he
 Although studies have been going on for a long time to understand catalysis, the final conclusion has not yet been reached in this subject
 vaigyanik isapar ekamat hai ki sabhi utprerak ek hi siddhant ke anusaar kriya nahin karte
 Two theories are used for the mechanism of catalysis - intermediate compound theory; Adsorption theory
 1
 madhyavarti yogic siddhant- yah utpreran kii vyakhya ke liye ek rasinic siddhant he
 Accordingly, the catalyst reacts with one of the first reagents to form an intermediate temporary compound; Then that intermediate temporary compound reacts with other reagents and gives the catalyst again in its precursor
 iske anusaar pratikarmakon "k" tathaa "kha" kii sangyojanakriya utprerak "ga" kii upasthiti main nimnlikhit prakaar se prakat kii jaati he: This sequence continues until the end of the verb
 madhyavarti yogic siddhant ke dwaara kuch kriyaaon ke utpreran kii vyakhya saral he
 But it is difficult or impossible to explain most heterogeneous actions and actions of catalytic inhibitors or poisons
 2
 adhishoshan siddhant- yah utpreran kii vyakhya ke liye bhautik siddhant he
 According to this theory, reagents condense at the bottom of the catalyst
 is prakaar utprerak tal par pratikarmakon kii sandratha bad jane se maatra-anupaati-niyam ke anusaar kriya kaa veg bad jaataa he
 Now a new theory has been formulated by combining both the above principles
 iske anusaar utprerak padaarth ke tal par kuch sakriy centre hote hai
 These centers have the ability to adsorb molecules or atoms
 at: dhaatu ke tal par pratikarmakon ke ghani bhoot hone se sadranta to badhati hi he, jiske kaaran kriyaveg main vruddhi hoti he, saath hi in sakriy kendron par pratikarmak inke saath asthaayee yogic bhi bana lete hai, jo madhyavarti yogic siddhant ke anusaar utpreran kaa kaary karte hai
 Fertilizers are complex organic materials that are derived from plants or animals
 ye adhikansh pratikriyaaon main atyutm utprerak siddh hue hai
 Enzymes act as catalysts in almost all the activities that occur in tree plants
 iske atirikt hamaare sharir main honevaali kriyaaon, visheshta bhojan ke pachan main bhi prakinv utprerak kaa kaam karte hai
 or ek or audyogic tathaa rasinic kriyakshetra main utprerak bahut hi upyogi siddh hue hai
 The stabilization of nitrogen is a simple example of catalytic action
 ped paudhon ke liye sthaayee nitrogen kii uplabdhi nitrate yaa ammonia ke rup main hoti he
 Both these forms of nitrogen are produced with the help of catalysts
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke samay lagbhag samast vishwa main motor aadi vaahanon ko chalaane main jo idhan kaam main laayaa jaataa tha vah sab utprerakon kii sahaayta se hi taiyaar kiya jaataa tha

 It also occurs in the Earth's magnetic field, where it is formed to the extent of a magnetic tornado
 messenzar upgrah kii gananaaon ke anusaar budh grah par chumbakeey punarmilan kii prakriya kii raftaar lagbhag 10 guna zyada he
 The proximity of the planet Mercury to the Sun was a factor of only one-third of the speed of its magnetic reunion measured by the Messenger
 budh kii kaksha sabhi grahon main sarvaadhik chapati he
 Its orbital concentration is 0

 It takes 87

 So far two spacecraft, Mariner 10 and Messenger Mercury, have gone
 mariner- 10 san 1974 tathaa 1975 ke madhya teen baar is grah kii yatra kar chukaa he
 a map of 45% of the surface of the planet Mercury has been made
 messenger yaan 2004 main nasa dwaara prakshepit kiya gaya tha
 It circled the planet Mercury in 2011

 The orbit of Mercury is highly decentralized, its distance from the Sun ranges from 46,000,000 km to 70,000,000 km
 jab budh surya ke nazdik hota he tab uski gati kaaphi dhimi hoti he
 In the 19th century, astronomers had carefully observed the orbit of Mercury, but based on Newton's laws, they could not understand the orbit of Mercury
 budh kii kaksha newton ke niyamo kaa paalan nahin karti he
 The difference between the illiterate class and the calculated class was small but troublesome for decades
 pehle yah sochaa gaya ki budh kii kaksha ke andar ek or grah ho saktaa he jo budh kii kaksha ko prabhvit kar rahaa he
 Even after considerable inspection no such planet was found
 is rahasy kaa hal kaaphi samay baad oinstin ke saadhaaran saapekshatawaad ke siddhant ne diya
 Correct calculation of Mercury's orbit was the first step towards the acceptance of this theory
 1962 tak yahi sochaa jaataa tha ki budh kaa ek din or varsh ek baraabar hote he jisase vah apana ek hi paksh surya kii ore rakhata he
 It was the same way that only one side of the moon is facing the earth
 lekin dapler siddhanth ne ise galat sabit kar diya
 It is now believed that Mercury has three days in two years
 arthath budh surya kii do parikramaon main apane aksh par teen baar ghumta he
 Mercury is the only body in the solar system whose orbit / rotation ratio is not 1: 1
 budh kii kaksha main surya se duuri main parivartan ke tathaa uske kaksha / ghurnan ke anupaat kaa budh kii sataha par koi nirikshak vicitra prabhaav dekhegaa
 On some latitudes, the illiterate will see the sun rising and as the sun rises above the horizon, its size will increase
 is sheersh bindu par aakar surya ruuk jaayegaa or kuch der viparit disha main jaayegaa or uske baad phir rukegaa or disha badal kar aakaar main ghatate huye kshitij main jaakar suryaast ho jaayegaa
 During this time, stars will be seen moving three times faster than the sun in the sky
 nireekshak budh kii sataha par vibhinn sthano par alag alag lekin surya kii vicitra gati ko dekhegaa
 Temperatures on the surface of Mercury go from 90 ° Kelvin to 700 ° Kelvin
 shukr par taapmaana isse garm he lekin sthaayee he
 There is a light atmosphere on Mercury which is mainly made up of atoms from the solar wind
 budh bahut garm he jisase ye parmaanu udakar antariksh main chale jate he
 This is unlike Earth and Venus whose environment is permanent, Mercury's atmosphere keeps on being new
 budh kii sataha par gadhde kaaphi gahare he, kuch saikado kimi lambe or teen kimi tak gahare he
 It appears that the surface of Mercury is about 0
1% narrower
 budh kii sataha par calories ghati he jo lagbhag 1300 kimi vyas kii he
 It is like the Mariya Valley of the Moon
 shaayad yah bhi kisi dhoomaketu yaa kshudragrah ke takaraane se bani he
 Apart from these pits, Mercury planet also has some flat plateaus which are probably made up of past volcanic activities
 mariner se praapt aankade bataate he ki budh par kuch jwalamukhi gatividhiyaan he lekin ise pramanit karne ke liye kuch or aankade chaiye
 Surprisingly there is evidence of aquatic ice in the craters of Mercury's North Pole

 Saptni or soutan This is the relation between wives in polygamy
 jab kisi ek purush se ek se adhik naariyaan vivaah kare, to wein naariyaan ek duusare kii sapatni hoti hai
 The evidence of ten women of Manu is found in Maitreyi Samhita
 rigvad main ek sampoorn sookt sapatni ke sandarbh main ullikhit he
 Although a wifewrat was considered an ideal marriage, the polytheism is also found in the Vedas
 jameendaari pratha bharat main mughal kaal evam british kaal main prachlit ek rajnatik-saamaajik kuriti thi jisamen bhoomi kaa swaamitv us par kaam karne waalon kaa na hokar kisi or kaa hota tha jo kheti karne waalon se kar vasuulate the
 This practice was abolished after India became independent
 bharat kii pracheen vichaardhaara ke anusaar bhoomi saarvajanik sampatti thi, isaliye yah vyakti kii sampatti nahin ho sakati thi
 Land, like air, water and light, was considered a gift of nature
 maharishi jaimini ke matanusaar "raja bhoomi kaa samarpan nahin kar saktaa tha kyonki yah uski sampatti nahin varan maanav samaaj kii sammilit sampatti he
 That is why everyone has equal rights over it "
 manu kaa bhi spasht kathan he ki "rishiyon ke matanusaar bhumiswamitv kaa pratham adhikaar use he jisane jangal katkar use saaf kiya tha jota" 
 Therefore, in a very large part of ancient India, the head of the village was elected by the village community and he was appointed with the consent of the state
 rajya use bhoomikar na dene par hataa saktaa tha, yadhyapi yah pad vanshanugat tha tathaa isaki prapti ke liye janamat tathaa rajyasweekruti aavashyak thi
 Therefore, those who are not elected were different from present-day landlords
 pracheen bharat main bhoomi kaa sampatti ke rup main krayvikray sambhav nahin tha
 This fact has also been confirmed by Western scholars Baden Powell and Sir George Campbell
 campbell kaa kathan he ki bhoomi jotane kaa adhikaar ek adhikaar maatr hi tha or hindu vyavastha ke anusaar bhoomi nahin mana gaya tha
 It has been known by modern research that in ancient India, there were feudatories, overheads, bhogikas, Pratiharas and Dandanayaks
 ye log newnaadhik samantpratha ke anukool the
 But we have not been sure about their rights and duties, except that these people used to send troops to their owners when needed
 in adhikariyon ko paarishramik ke rup main bhoomi pradaan kii jaati thi
 According to Yajnavalkya regarding the land system, there were four classes, Mahipati, Kshetraswami, Krishak and Shikami
 acharya brihaspati ne kshetraswami ke sthaan main keval swami shabd kaa hi prayog kiya he parantu iskaa spashtikaran kar diya he ki swami, raja or khetihar ke madhya kaa varg tha
 The above description only indicates the classification of land holdings, and not to bring the farmer to the level of an Anglo slave
 mukhya prashn to yah he ki bhoomi par swatv adhikaar kisko - rajya ko, krishak ko athwa kisi madhyavarti varg ko vidwaanon ke matanusaar pracheen bharat main yah adhikaar hi tha jo swatv adhikaar nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We do not find any transformation in this ancient land during Yavana rule and neither is there any change in the basic principles of land-rights
 yavan shaasha bhoomikar gaanv ke mukhiya dwaara hi vasuul karte the or kabhi-kabhi sthaneey saradaaron vaa raajaaon dwaara, jo apana str gaanv ke mukhiya se unchaa hone kaa daawa karte the
 The claim of these kings appears to have produced an intermediate class between the state and the cultivator
 parantu samantvaad pad avrodh sthaayee rakhaa gaya tha kyonki rajya sarvada in raajaaon ko karmchaaree hi maanate the
 Although these kings were beginning to be hereditary, the state always had the right to grant and take back their post
 ek raja ke uttaradhikari ko raja kii sanad praapt karne ke liye prarthanapatr dena padataa tha or sanad kii prapti ke pashchaat hi vah raja hota tha
 In the Ainacabari, no intermediate class is recognized between the farmer and the state
 tathakthith raja or jameendaar saidhantik or vaastavik rup main keval kar vasuul karanevaale karmchaaree hi the
 It is notable that the Yavana rulers never claimed land-ownership-rights
 yah baat in aitihaasik tathyon se spasht he ki aurangzeb ne hundi, palam tathaa anya sthanon par krishakon se bhoomi kharidi thi, jaisaa akbar ne akbarabad or elahabaad main kile banane ke liye kiya tha
 Shah Jahan also did the same, it is proved from the above evidence that the Yavana rulers believed in property rights only in collecting taxes and not in the land
 unke shasankaal main krishak ke adhikaron ko ucchtam manyata di gai thi
 The farmer used to give it by the king and the head of the village and the king and the chief received remuneration for this work by the state
 san 1707 i0 main aurangzeb kii mrityu ke pashchaat krishakon ke adhikaron kaa lop dhire-dhire aarambh hua jab ki kendriya satta shithil padane lagi
 The sentiment of semi-feudal selfishness emerged during this time of monopoly
 jab rajya kii satta shithil padane lagi, rajya ke karmchaaree praja ke janmaal kii raksha karne main asamarth hone lage
 As a result, the villagers began to take the help of powerful employees and kings or chiefs for the protection
 in logon ne swabhaavat: sharnaarthi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron par akraman kiya
 Under these conditions, seedlings of Zamindari system are found
 parantu is sankatkaal main bhi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron kaa purna samarpan nahin hua tha
 Zamindari system started to emerge from the arrival of British in India
 angrej shaskaon kaa vishwaas tha ki ve bhoomi ke swami hai or krishak unki praja hai isaliye unhone sthaayee tathaa asthaayee bandobast bade krishakon tathaa raajaaon or jameendaaron se kiye
 Although impressed by the political rationale, he leased one pargana to the monopolist who collected every tax for five years
 is prakaar jameendaari pratha ko angrajon ne manyata pradaan kii yadhyapi aarambh main unka vichaar krishakon ko unke adhikaron se vanchit karne kaa nahin tha san 1786 i0 main lard corn walis, warren hestigaj ke baad, garvanar general hua
 Lord Cornwallis was also in favor of Zamindari system
 usne san 1791 i0 bengal, bihar tathaa urisa main das varshiya bandobast kii ajna di
 Two years later, the Board of Directors gave permission to make this ten-year plan a permanent settlement
 madras main jameendaari pratha kaa udai angrej shaskaon kii nilaam niti dwaara hua
 The lands of the villages were divided and auctioned and sold to the highest payer
 prarambh main avadh main bandobast krishak se hi kiya gaya tha parantu tadnantar raajnneetik kaarnon se yah bandobast jameendaaron se kiya gaya
 In the settlement report of the great historian Sir Vincent A
 Smith, Aligarh, it clearly acknowledges that the settlements were made to the monopolies, aiming only at utility, ignoring the prevailing land rights
 anyaaypurna karrashi ikattha karne kaa yah sabase saral upaay he tathaa yah raajnneeti ke drushtikon se bhi upyogi he kyonki iske falswaroop sarkaar kaa ek shaktishaalee tathaa dhani varg kii sahaayta milti rahegi
 Thus in the history of India for the first time these settlements established the class of landlords between the state and the farmers by the policy of the British, which resulted in the loss of the property rights of the farmers who had been in existence since time immemorial
 yah madhyavarti varg din prati din dhani hota gaya kyonki angrej shaasha apni karrashi main se adhik se adhik hissaa unhen pralobhan ke rup main dete rahe
 In these settlements, no attention was paid to the interests of the farmers, as a result of which their grief, humiliation and humiliation increased day by day
 kai baar angrej shaskaon ne bhi is ore dhyaan dilaayaa ki krishakon kii bhudhruti kii raksha kii jaay evam unka lagaan bandobast ke samay tak nirdhaarit kar diya jaay
 Still nothing was done
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej shaskaon kii dharna thi ki jameendaaron ke saath vyavhaar main udaartaa dikhaane par jab ve sampann evam santusht rahenge to ve apane asamiyon ko nahin sataayenge jiske falswaroop ve bhi khushhaal rahenge
 But this was his great mistake because the landlords always betrayed their duty
 at: angrej shaasha yah mahasoos karne lage ki is bhul kaa sudhaar kiya jaae
 As a result, they arranged land related legislation to improve the condition of the farmers
 yah kadam jameendaari pratha ke ast kii disha main pratham charan kaha ja saktaa he
 In this first phase, which lasted from 1859 AD to 1929 AD, the laws that were enacted imposed certain restrictions on the rights of landlords to increase the rent and also benefited the higher class farmers
 kintu in kanoonon kaa mukhya uddeshy jameendaaron ko lagaan vasuul karne main sahuuliyat dene kaa tha jisase ve rajya ko rajasav thik samay par de saken
 In 1859 AD, the first land related act was passed
 yah adhinium samast british bharat ke liye ek adarsh bhoomi-adhinium tha jiske anuroop adhinium bharat ke sabhi bhaagon main paas hue or samay samay par unamem sanshodhan bhi kiye gaye taaki asantusht krishakon ko shant kiya ja sake
 But the landlords still continued to squeeze the peasants to recover their just and unjust taxes, which caused widespread dissatisfaction and restlessness among the farmers
 jameendaari pratha ke ast ke kram main doosraa charan san 1930 i0 se 1944 i0 tak rahaa
 During this time, peasant movements started happening all over the country
 in andolanon kaa beej ek kisaan sabha ne boyaa tha jo akhil bhartiya congress kii elahabaad baithak main taarikh 11 farvari san 1918 i0 ko hui thi
 After that the Congress started to advance the interests of the farmers

 Jawaharlal Neh degree announced in the U
P
 Congress Committee on 27 October 1928 that political freedom is meaningless till the farmers get freedom from exploitation
 shanai: shanai: kisaanon kii jaagrukta badi or saath hi saath unki vyakulata bhi
 The peasant class now became more vocal and began to demand stability of land and reduction in revenue
 kisaan andolanon se prabhavit hokar raiyyatwarikshetron main nae adhinium banaae gaye jinase krishakon ke hiton kii raksha ho sake
 The Malabar Tenancy Act is a landmark in this regard
 iske baad bhopal land revenue act, 1935 tathaa assam tenency act 1935 paas hue
 Under the Government of India Act, 1935, when the 'special Autonomy' was inaugurated, the Provincial Governments arranged Land Reforms Acts which gave more rights to farmers and curtailed the rights of landlords
 you0 pi0 tenency act, 1939, tathaa bombai tenency act, 1939 vishisht udhaaharan aise vyapak adhiniyamon ke hai jinke dwaara krishakon ko maurusi adhikaar die gaye evam krishakon ke hit main jameendaaron ke katipay adhikaar chin liye gaye
 Even after the enactment of these Land Reforms Acts, the evils of the Zamindari system existed, although the Zamindars were paralyzed to a large extent
 in jameendaaron ko neh degree ji ‘british sarkaar kii atilaalit santan ’ kaha karte the
 He was a symbol of the past feudalistic practice which was completely contrary to modern conditions
 isliye indian neshnal congress ne kai baar is baat kii ghoshnaa kii ki jameendaari unmoolan ko congress ke kaarykram main pramukh sthaan dena chahie
 a farmer conference date was held on 27, 28 April 1935 in Allahabad under the chairmanship of Sardar Patel
 usne jameendaari unmoolan ko prastaav paas karke is ore ek pramukh kadam uthaaya is prastaav main yah ghoshnaa kii gai thi ki ‘gramakalyaan ke drushtikon se vartmaan jameendaari pratha bilkul vipareet he
 This practice was brought in the arrival of British rule and rural life has been completely destroyed by this'
 parantu san 1939 i0 main dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru ho jane ke kaaran bhoomi sudhaar kaa sara kaarykram ruuk gaya
 After the end of the war, the last phase of the end of Zamindari system started which lasted from 1945 to 1955
 yuddh samaapt hote hi british sarkaar ne 1945 i0 main government of india act 1935 i0 ke antargat prantiy sadanon ke chunaav karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Congress decided to participate in the elections and in December 1945 took out the election manifesto
 is ghoshnaptr main jameendaari unmoolan ke vishay main spashtatya kaha gaya ki ‘bhoomi vyavastha kaa sudhaar, jisaki bharat main ati aavashyaktaa he, krishakon tathaa rajyake bich madhyavarti varg ko hataane se sambandhit he
 Therefore the rights of this intermediate class should be obtained by giving proper compensation '
 is ghoshnaa patr se arthshaastri, raajnneetijna tathaa patrkaar sabhi sahamat the
 Zamindari system hindered Indian economic development because the big landlords were always advocates of reactionism
 ‘landan iconomist’ ne inke vishay main likhaa tha ki ‘inamen se adhiktar ‘thekarase’ ke paatr ‘lard steen’ kii tarah dushcharitra, ‘jine astine’ ke ‘mistar benet’ kii tarah aalsee, ‘surtijasquaire’ kii tarah sharaabi the 
 The Bengal Land Commission also came to the conclusion that 'permanent settlement of 1793 AD, for whatever reasons was deemed appropriate at that time, is unsuitable in today's situation and has created so many evils in the zamindari system that it is no longer in the interest of the nation Even the type is no longer useful
 ’ bhartiya tathaa paashchaatya arthvettaon kii raay main jameendaari unmoolan adhik krishi utpaadan ke liye atyaavashyak he
 In addition, this practice has ended in every part of the world due to lack of time
 punasch, yah pratha rajya ke liye adhik kharchili he
 Above all, this practice had reached such a state at this time that if it had not been eradicated, it would have caused disasters not only on national economic problem but also on social security
 at: san 1946 i0 main chunaav main safalataa ke falswaroop jab har praant main congress mantrimandal bane to chunaav pratigya ke anusaar jameendaari pratha ko samaapt karne ke liye vidheyak prastut kiye gaye
 These Bills became Act from 1950 to 1955, which resulted in the abolition of Zamindari system in India and re-established direct relations between farmers and the state
 bhoomi ke swatvadhikaar ab krishakon ko waapas mil gaye jinka upyog ve anadi paramparaagat kaal se karte chale aae the
 In this way, the zamindari system that emerged with the arrival of the British in our country also ended at the end of their rule
 is pratha kii samaapti par kisi ne tanik bhi shok prakat nahin kiya, kyonki iskaa vinaash hote hi puraane siddhant kii, jiske anusaar bhoomi kaa swami krishak hota tha, punrariti hui
 Which was the end of the Zamidari system on 02 / 10 / 1951, Gwalior princely state in Madhya Pradesh also had the system of zamindari, which was dominated by Gwalior princely state of Agar Susner etc

 159 minutes ₹ 504 karod Bahubali is an Indian film made in Telugu and Tamil languages
 yah hindi, malayalam va kuch videshi bhashaaon main bhi bani he tathaa ise 10 july 2015 ko cinemagharon main dikhaaya gaya
 It is directed by SS Rajamouli
 prabhas, rana daggubati, anoushka shetty or tamanna ne mukhya kirdaar nibhaae hai
 Ramya Krishnan, Satyaraj, Nassar, Adiv Sesh, Tanikell Bharani and Sudeep have also worked in it
 film kii kuch khaas baton main se ek rahi is film main chitrit kalkey kabeeley dwaara boli jane vaali kilikili naamak ek kritrim bhashaa jiskaa nirmaan madhan karki ne lagbhag 750 shabdon or 40 vyakaran ke niyamon dwaara kiya
 This is the first time in the history of Indian film, when a new language has been created for a film
 bharat ke pracheen samrajyon main se ek mahishmati, kii rani shivagaamee, ek vishaal jalprapaat ke nikat kii maand se ek shishu ko god liye baahar aati he
 She boldly kills the soldiers in her pursuit and sacrifices her own life to protect the baby
 ain samay par, sthaneey gramin pani main dubi rani kii upar uthi baanh main shishu ko dekh lete hai or us bachche ko surakshit bachaa lete hai
 In this way the queen merges by drowning in the falling waterfall from the height of the mountain
 sanga evam uske pati us shishu kaa naam shiva rakhte hai or apane balak samaan hi parvarish karte hai
 As time passes, Shiva grows up to be a powerful young man who aspires to climb mountains and tries unsuccessfully at times
 ek roj use jalprapaat main behate hue kisi yuvati kaa mukhauta miltaa he
 Desiring to find the identity of the young woman, he attempts a mountain climb again and eventually succeeds
 jalprapaat ke shikhar par, shiva us mukhute kii maalik avanatika ko khoj nikaalata he, ek vidrohi yoddha jiskaa dal gorilla paddati ke jariye mahishmati samrajya ke raja bhallaal dev / pallavathevan ke viruddh yuddh lard rahaa he
 The goal of the party is to rescue the former queen Devasena, who has been confined in the palace for the last 25 years in the palace
 or yah mahatvapurn jimmevary avanatika ko saunpa gaya he
 Avanatika loves to hear Shiva saying that he has come only for her while climbing all the difficulties of this waterfall
 shiva ab is abhiyaan ko apane jimme lene vachan detaa he or chhipate-chhupate hue mahishmati main pravesh kar devsena ko kaid se mukt karaata he
 Shiva redeems him and escapes with him, but soon the king's royal slave Kattappa, who is known for his excellent battle skills, follows him
 magar ghaat lagaae bhadraa, bhallaal dev kaa putr, achaanak hi shiva ke sar par waar karata he, magar katappa apane shastr gira detaa he jab use maaloom hota he ki shiva asal main mahendra bahubali he, divangat raja amrendra bahubali kaa putr
 Then here the past events of King Amarendra Baahubali which happened in the past are mentioned
 amrendra kii mata kii mrityu uske janm pashchaat hota he, jabaki pita usase kaaphi purv hi guzar chuke hote hai
 Sivagami, with the support of his bodyguard Katappa, takes over the reins of the empire until the new king is elected
 vah amrendra bahubali tathaa bhallaal dev ko samaan rup se parvarish detii he, unhen kala, vigyaan, chal-vidya, raajnneeti or yuddh kala jaise kai vidyaon evam prashikshan main paarangat kiya jaataa he, magar donon main hi samrajya ke shashan kii abhilaashaa bhinn rahati he
 While Amarendra treats Bahubali moderately towards the people, Bhallal Dev is extremely tough and takes every possible ruthlessness to achieve his goal, even he kills Bahubali
 jab mahishmati ko shatru kalaakeyas dwaara yuddh kii chunauti milti he, shivagaamee vachan detii he ki jo koi bhi kalaakeyas ke raja kaa sir katkar laaegaa use nayaa raja bana diya jayega or is tarah donon natinon ke bich barabari se yuddh sadhano kaa bantwaare kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 But Bhallal Dev's handicapped father, Bijjala Deva, provides more and more fighting tools to Bhallal by deceit
 yuddh main jab mahishmati ek dfa asafal hokar apana ant samaj leti he, amrendra apane sainikon ko uske saath mrityu se hi ladane ko punah prerit karata he or shatruon ko kuchalakar yuddh samaapt karata he
 But Bhallal Dev already kills the king of Kalakeya, Sivagami chooses Amarendra Bahubali as the new ruler over his decision of superiority and leadership in the battle, making Bhallal Dev the commander for his courage and valor
 
 is purv ghatnaon ke baad, jab raja amrendra ke bare main prashn kiya gaya, to bhavuk katappa raja ke dehanth hone kii baat kahata he, or katappa swayan ko hi unki mrityu kaa jimmedaar bataata he
 i was 7 when i read the Amar Chitra Katha published in India

 Although it is now the most widely taught form of economics, the school of thought still has its critics
 sabase adhik aalochana bataate hai ki navashastreey arthshaastra kai niraadhaar or avastavik anumaan he ki vaastavik sthitiyon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte banaata he
 For example, the notion that all parties will behave rationally overlooks the fact that human nature is vulnerable to other forces, which can cause people to make irrational choices
 isliye, kai aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki is drushtikon vaastavik arthvyavasthaaon kaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Neoclassical economics is also sometimes blamed for inequality in global debt and trade relations because the theory holds that such matters as labor rights will naturally improve as a result of the economic situation
