 gondofurni raajaaon ne adhikansh samay takshashila ko apni rajdhani banaaya, magar shashan ke antim samay main unki rajdhani kabul va peshawar ke madhya sthanantarit ho gayi
 His coins were influenced by the Pahlavi Empire, for this reason he was known as hind-pahlav

 The average yield in the state is very low as compared to other producing regions of the country
 madhyapradesh main isaki kheti pradhan rup se chhindwara, baitool, mandla, siwani, dindori evam shahdol jilon main kii jaati he
 35 - 45 percent oil and 25 to 35 percent quantity are found in the seeds of Ramtil
 ramatil kii fasal visham paristhitiyon main bhi ugaai ja sakati he
 The crop can also be taken in unproductive and low fertile land
 iskaa tel evam beej purnat: vifaille tatwon se mukt rahata he tathaa yah keedon bimariyon junglee jaanwaron tathaa pakshiyon se hone vaali kshati se kam prabhavit hoti he
 Crop prevents erosion of land

 Chhayavad is that poetic stream of the romantic rise of Hindi literature which circa AD From 1918 to 1936, there was a major epoch
 atmabhivyakti, prakruti prem, nari prem, maanvikaran, saanskrithik jaagran, kalpana kii pradhanta aadi chhayavaadi kavy kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai
 Chhayavad fully distinguished the standing poetry in Hindi
 iske baad brajabhasha hindi kavy dhara se baahar ho gai
 It gave new words, symbols and images to Hindi
 iske prabhaav se is daur kii gadhy kii bhashaa bhi samrudh hui
 The era of Shadowism in Hindi poetry came after the Dwivedi era
 dvivedi yug kii kavita neeras upadeshaatmak or itivrittatmak thi
 Kalpnapradhan, rebellious poetry was composed while revolting against it in shadowism
 yah bhashaa or bhaavon ke str par apane daur ke bangla ke suprasiddh kavi or nobel puraskaar vijeta rabindranath thakur kii gitanjali se bahut prabhavit hui
 It was also influenced by ancient Sanskrit literature and medieval Hindi literature
 isamen buddha darshan or sufi darshan kaa bhi prabhaav lakshith hota he
 The Shadow Age was a universal development of the cultural and literary awakening that began in the national periphery with Bharatendu Yug
 kavi ke keval sookshm bhavatmak darshan kaa hi nahin, 'chaaya' se uske sookshm kalabhivyajan kaa bhi parichay miltaa he
 His poetry has semiotics and phonetics rather than speech
 anubhuti kii nigudhata ke kaaran asphutata bhi he
 There is a new sense of raga in the style or a new expression
 dvivedi yug main kavita kaa dhaanchaa padya kaa tha
 In fact, only the management of prose was translated into it, the language also became prose
 chhayavaad ne padya kaa dhaanchaa todakar khadi boli ko kaavyatmak bana diya
 The poem had a voluminous history, the poetry of cinematography had an emotional encapsulation, the poetry of cinematography had an emotional intonation
 bhav ke anuroop hi chhayavaad kii bhashaa or chand bhi ragaatmak or rasaatmak ho gaya
 Brijbhasha was followed by the revival of lyricism by Chhayavada
 chhayavaad yug ke pratinidhi kavi hai- prasad, niraala, pant, mahadevi, ramkumar
 The foregoing associates are Makhanlal and 'naveen'
 geetkavy ke baad chhayavaad main bhi mahakavy kaa nirmaan hua
 Tulsidas, like 'swant', had moved on the path of the Lok Sangraha, in the same way, the poet of Chhayavad has moved from the private world of solitude to the public world with respect to 'swatam'
 prasad kii 'kamayani' or pant kaa 'lokayatan' iskaa pramaan he
 'kamayani' is towards Vindu in the Indus, 'lokayatan' is towards the Indus in Vindu
 sanwat 1917 ke aasapaas maithilisharan gupt, mukutadhar pandeya aadi kavi khadiboli kavy ko adhik kalpanamay, chitramay or antarbhaav vyanjak rup-rang dene main pravrutt hue yah svachhnd or nutan paddati apana rasta nikaal rahi thi ki rabindranath kii rahasyatmak kavitaaon kii dhooma hui
 And many poets simultaneously turned to solitude as mysticism and symbolism or pictorialism
 chitrabhasha yaa abhivyanjan paddati par hi jab lakshya tik gaya tab uske pradarshan ke liye loukik yaa alokik prem kaa kshetra hi baaki samajha gaya
 Poetry moving within this bounded area assumed the name Chhayavad
 chhayavaadi shabd kaa prayog do arthon main samajhnaa chaiye
 One is in the sense of mysticism, where it relates to the poetic object, that is, where the poet consults that infinite and unknown beloved in many ways in a very pictorial language
 is arth kaa doosraa prayog kavy-style yaa paddati-vishesh ke vyapak arth main hota he’ chhayavaad kaa saamanytah arth hua prastut ke sthaan par uski vyanjana karanevaali chaaya ke rup main aprastut kaa kathan
 Shadowism was practiced as a reaction to the dry chronicles of the Dwivedi period
 jaise, dhul kii dheri main anjaane, chhipe hai mere madhumay gaan
 The perception of spiritual shadow in the subtle but expressed beauty of nature, i think, should be a universally accepted interpretation of Shadowism
 ’ At the end of the Second World War, a wave of new consciousness raged all over the country
 san 1929 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main bharatvarsh videshi gulaami ko jhaad-phenkane ke liye katibaddh ho gaya
 It should not be limited to politics alone
 yah sampurna desh kaa aatm swaroop samajhane kaa praytn tha or apni galatiyon ko sudhaar kar sansar kii samrudh jatiyon kii prati- dwandvita main agrasar hone kaa sankalp tha
 In short, it was a great cultural movement
 chittagat unmukhataa is kavita kaa pradhan udgam thi or badalte hue maano ke prati drudh aasthaa iskaa pradhan sambal
 The poets of this category were highly endowed with talent and were highly conscious of social disparities and inconsistencies
 style kii drushti se bhi ye pehle ke kaviyon se ekadam bhinn the
 His work was predominantly thematic
 san 1920 kii khadiboli kavita main vishaywastu kii pradhanta bani hui thi
 But in the poem that follows, the poet's own raga-vigyan prevailed
 vishay apane aap main kaisaa he ? yah mukhya baat nahin thi
 Rather the main thing remained that how does the subject look after the subject is stunned by the raga-viraga? As a result, the subject became secondary and the poet was the chief
 1920 ke aasapaas, yug kii udbuddha chetana ne bahya abhivyakti se niraash hokar, jo atmbaddh antarmukhi sadhana aarambh kii, vah kavy main chhayavaad ke rup main abhivyakt hui’ Whatever the meaning of the word Chhayavad, but in practical terms it represents all the poems of Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Mahadevi which were written between 1918 and 36 AD
 ’ ve aage likhte hai- ‘chhayavaad us rashtriya jaagran kii kaavyatmak abhivyakti he jo ek ore puraani rudhiyon se mukti chahta tha or duusari ore videshi paradheenata se
 ' ‘kavy ke kshetra main puranic yug kii kisi ghatana athwa desh-videsh kii sundari ke bahya varnan se bhinn jab vednaa ke aadhaar par swanubhutimayi abhivyakti hone lagi tab hindi main use chhayavaad naam se abhihit kiya gaya
 'prasad ji says in the end- From the Indian point of view the cinematic poem relies more on perception and expression
 dhvanyaatmakataa, lakshanikta, saundarya, prakruti-vidhaan tathaa upachaar vakrata ke saath swanubhuti kii vivritti chhayavaad kii visheshtaayen hai
 ' chhayavaad ko paashchaatya sahitya ke romantisism se prabhavit maanate hai
 She considers the basic philosophy of cinematism as totalism and nature as its means
 unke chhayavaad ne manushya ke hrruday or prakruti ke us sambandh main praan daal die jo pracheen kaal se bimb-pratibimb ke rup main chalaa aa rahaa tha or jiske kaaran manushya ko prakruti apane dukh main udhaas or sukh main pulakit jaan padati thi’is prakaar mahadevi ke anusaar chhayavaad kii kavita hamaara prakruti ke saath ragaatmak sambandh sthapit karake hamaare hrruday main vyapak bhavanubhuti utpann karti he or ham samast vishwa ke upkarnon se ekatm bhav sambandh jod lete hai
 She considers mysticism to be the second step of cinematism
 chhayavaad kii pramukh pravritiyon kaa vibhaajan ham teen yaa do sheershakon ke antargat kar sakate hai
 All the poets in Shadowism have expressed their experience as my experience
 is main style ke peeche aadunik yuvak kii swayan ko abhivyakt karne kii saamaajik saamaajik swatantraaa kii aakanksha he
 The dramatic and empirically proven dramatic system of expression through the characters of the story or the mythological characters was not fully capable of expressing its sentiments
 vyaktik abhivyakti kii swatantraaa vyakti kii mukti se sambhddha thi
 This expressive expression is far ahead of the devotion of devout poets
 yah aihik vyaktikta aavaran hin thi
 There was no cover of religion on this
 saamanti naitikta ko asweekaar karte hue pant ne uchhavas or ansu kii balika se sidhe shabdon main apana pranay prakat kiya he:-"balika meri manoram mitra thi
 "moving beyond the personal area, Nirala wrote a condolence on the death of his daughter and clearly stated many things in life
 sampadakon dwaara mukt chand kaa lautaaya janaa, virodhiyon kaa shabdic prahaar, saamaajik roodhiyon ko todate hue ekadam nae dhang se saroj kaa vivaah karnaadi likhakar saamaajik kshetra ke apane anubhav sidhe-sidhe main style main abhivyakt kiya
 Similarly, through his story Nirala has attacked the old social stereotypes and modern vampires through his story
 nari-saundarya or prem-chithran chhayavaadi kaviyon ne nari ko prem kaa alamban mana he
 He embraced the woman as a beloved, who is full of all the feelings of youth and heart
 jisamen dharti kaa saundarya or swarg kii kaalpanik sushamaa samanvit he
 Therefore, these poets have written many pictures of the beloved
 kamayani main prasad ne shraddha ke chithran main jaadu bhar diya he
 The love of shadowy poets is also special
 prakruti saundarya kaa sarsatam varnan or usase prem kaa varnan bhi chhayavaadi kaviyon kii ullekhneey visheshta he
 Bygone vibrari yaa Expiration time was above the cloudy sky vah sandhya sundari pari-si dhire-dhire
 The trend of the romanticism begins with the poems of Sridhar Pathak
 padya ke swaroop, abhivyanjana ke dhang or prakruti ke swaroop kaa nirikshan aadi pravritiyaan chhayavaad main prakat hui
 As well as the direct exclusion of self-realization, which extends from personal love to compassion and bliss
 aalochakon ne chhayavaad par svachhndata kaa prabhaav bataaya he to duusari ore iskaa virodh bhi prakat kiya he
 This tendency of romanticism is always against country, time, and trends
 jahaan kahin bhi bandhan hai, samaaj, rajya, kavita or jivan- tamaam staron par in rudhiyon kaa svachhndatavaadi kavi virodh karata he
 English literature had strict discipline before Romantic poetry and its form was also religious, moral and poetic
 atah angreji kaviyon ne in bandhanon kaa tiraskaar kiya
 But the pre-dwivediuga from the Chhayawadi poets has the primacy of moral vision and the Chhayawadi also shows opposition to it
 chhayavaadi pravriti svachhnd pranay kii nahin kintu punarutthanavaadee zyada thi
 Because reticulate makeup has an effect on her
 jahaan darshanik siddhanton kaa sambandh he chhayavaadi kavy main sarvaad, karmwaad, vedant, shaiva-darshan, advaitvaad aadi puraane siddhanton kii abhivyakti milti he
 As far as language-style is concerned, the expressive method of Chhayawadi is new and refreshing
 dvivediyugin khadiboli main sthulata, varnanaatmakataa adhik he
 But in chauvinist poetry, the treatment of curvature and humanization features due to the representation of subtlety
 dvivediyugin kavy vishaynishth, varnan- pradhan or sthool he to chhayavaadi kavy vyaktinishth or kalpana-pradhan he
 Dwivediugin poetry incorporates the breadth and diversity of the universe
 usee prakaar chhayavaad kii kavita main manojgat kii vaani ko prakat karne kaa praytn he
 The shadowy poets have used energetic imagination to realize the subtle truths of the occult
 chhayavaad main vedant se lekar anandwad tak kaa prabhaav dikhaai padataa he
 It also gives a glimpse of Buddhist and Gandhi philosophy
 "tum tung himalay shring or main chanchal gati sur sarita
 You Vimal Heart Sorrow and i Kant Kamini Poem
 " "watch others laugh, Manu, laugh and get happiness
" apane sukh ko vismrit kar lo, sabko sukhi banaao
 " "gyaan dur, kuch kriya bhinn he, ichha puri kyon ho man kii, donon mil ek na ho sake, yahi vidmbana he jivan kii
 " "tap re madhur-madhur man, vishwa-vednaa main tap pratipal,teri madhur mukti hi bandhan, gandh hin tu gandh yukt ban
 " jaishankar prasad kii kuch rachanaaon ke udhaaharan dekhen- pratikon ke dwaara inhone apni abhivyakti kii maarmikata main vruddhi kii he
 He has done many experiments to portray the tangible as intangible and the intangible as tangible
 jaise, The word Vijay was originally used to mean victory in war
 bhagawatpur, elahabaad elahabaad jile ke elahabaad prakhand kaa ek gaanv he

 In a message to Congress leader Jindal, the ministry said that the proposal has been examined and in many places there is no objection to the flag hoisting of the national flag to hoist the national flag day and night
 jindal ne june 2009 main mantralay ko diye gayi prastaav main bade aakaar ke rashtriya dhvaj ko smarakon ke polon par raat main bhi fahraaye jane kii anumati maangi thi
 Jindal had said that the national flag should be hoisted as far as possible between sunrise to sunset based on the flag code of India, but it is common throughout the world to hoist large national flag day and night on memorials at 100 feet or higher

 Theodolite or theodolite is a device that is widely used in surveys to measure horizontal and upward angles created by other points at a point on the surface of the Earth
 surveykshan kaa aarambh hi kshaitij or urdhv kone padhane se hota he, jiske liye theodolite hi sabase adhik yatharth fal denevaala yantra he
 Therefore, this survey is the most important instrument of action
 thiodolite kshaitij or urdhwadhar donon tarah ke konon ko maapne kaa upkaran he, jiskaa prayog, trikoshmetiya network main kiya jaataa he
 It is one of the most important tools used in surveying and engineering work done in inaccessible places
 aajkal vikonman ko anukulit kar vishisht uddeshyon jaise ki mausam vigyaan or rocket prakshepan praudyogiki jaise kshetron main bhi upyog me laayaa ja rahaa he
 a modern theodolite consists of a mobile telescope located between two vertical axes
 is doordarshee ko ek icchit vastu par ingit karke in dono akshon ke konon ko ati parishuddhta ke saath mapa ja saktaa he
 The transit developed in the early 19th century was a special form of theodolite for the telescope that had a 'flop over' facility that could be easily retrospectively
 saath hi truti kam karne ke liye konon ko doguna kiya ja saktaa tha
 Some transit devices were then able to directly measure an angle of thirty arc-seconds
 20 veen shatabdi ke madhya main, pargaman ko ek kam parishuddhta ke ek saadhaaran vikonman ke rup main janaa jane laga tha, par isame maapak aavardhan or yantric meter jaise suvidhaon kaa abhaav tha
 Transit has declined in importance since the introduction of compact, accurate electronic deviations but is still used as a lightweight device at construction sites

 Often a construction-level is mistakenly assumed to be a transit, but is actually a type of diagonal angle measuring instrument
 yah na to kshaitij or na hi urdhwadhar kone maap saktaa he
 It consists of a spirit-level and a visionary through which the user establishes a visual line on a flat plane
 koi saidhantik bhinnata ke na hone par bhi mukhyat: do aadhaaron par vikonmaanon kaa vargeekaran hua he
 The basis of the first type of classification is whether or not the telescope can travel full circle in the vertical plane
 vargeekaran kaa doosraa aadhaar he, yantron main lage ankit vrutt ke vibhaajan-ansh padhane kii suvidha, jaise varneer vikonman, jisamen vrutt ke vibhaajan ansh padhane ke liye varneer maapni kaa prayog hota he; micrometer vikonman, jinamein ansh padhane ke liye sookshmmapi pechon kaa prayog hota he; kaanch-chaap vikonman, jinamein kaanch ke ankit vrutt hote hai or unke padhe janevaale chaapon ke pratibindu ko prekshak ke saamne laane kii prakaashiya suvidh kii vyavastha hoti he

 phir doorabeen par die focus pench ko ghumaakar doorabeen main dur kii vastu kaa spasht pratibimb dekha jaataa he
 This action is called focusing
 focus tab sahi mana jaataa he jab netrika ke paas aankh dhire-dhire upar neeche karne se pratibimb tantuon se hatataa na dikhaai de
 This is called elimination of displacement
 iske baad kshatijakaari penchon ko samuchit rup se ghumaakar urdhv plate par lage pansal kaa bulbula kendrit kiya jaataa he, jisase plate ko ghumaakar kisi bhi sthiti main rakhane se bulbula kendrit rahe
 This action is called horizontalization
 pun: doorabeen saadhane ke stambh se lage ek pench se urdhvavrutt ke varneron par lage pansal kaa bulbula kendrit kar diya jaataa he
 After performing the above actions, the binoculars are rotated and stopped in such a way that the vertical circle is read, the vernier coincides with the zero line, or the mark-line, on the line of the vertical circle

 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Pythagorean theorem
 pithagoras prameya eucalidia jyamiti main kisi samakon tribhuj ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek sambandh bataane vaala prameya he
 This theorem is usually expressed as an equation in the following way- jahaan c samakon tribhuj ke karn kii lambaai he tathaa a or b anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai he
 Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician
 paramparanusaar unhen hi is prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, haalanki yah mana jane laga he ki is prameya kii jaankaree unase purv tithi kii he
 This theorem is given in the ancient Indian Buddhist Buddhist Shulbasutra
 kaaphi pramaan he ki babylon ke ganitagyon bhi is siddhant ko jaanate the
 It is also called 'boudhayan-pythagoras theorem'
 agar ham karn kii lambaai ko c or anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai ko a or b lete hai, to prameya ko nimnlikhit sameekaran ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: or, yadi c pehle se diya gaya he or ek bhujaa kii lambaai nikaalnaa ho, to nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he : or yah sameekaran samakon trikon ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek saral sambandh pradaan karata he
 The generalization of this theorem is called the 'cosine rule', with the help of which the length of the third side of any triangle can be calculated if the length of the remaining two sides and the angle between them is measured
 yah ek aisa prameya he jiske anya pramayon kii tulana main sambhavtah sarvaadhik pramaan gyaat hai 
 In the book Pythagorean Theorem, composed by Elisha Scott Loomis, 367 evidences are given
 boudhayan prameya ke adhikansh pramaanon kii tarah, yah do samroop tribhujon kii bhujaaon ke samaanupati hone ke gun par aadhaarit he
 Let ABC be a right angled triangle, in which angle c is right angled, as shown in the figure
 ham c bindu se karn par lamb daalate hai or bhujaa AB ke saath us lamb kii lambaai h hai
 This new triangle ACH is similar to our triangle ABC, because they both have right angles and a is their angle
 iskaa matlab he kii teesraa kone bhi donon tribhujon main samaan he
 On this basis, triangle CBH is also similar to ABC
 in samarupataaon se hamen do samaanupaat praapt hote hai: like tathaa They can also be written as in do samikarnon kaa sankshep karne par, In other words, the Boudhayan theorem: euclid ke tatwon main, pustak 1 kaa prastaav 47, boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit linon ke saath ek tark se sabit hota he
 A, B, c are considered the vertices of the right triangle, in which the right angle will be on A
 Drop a perpendicular from a to Karna opposite the square at the hypotenuse
 The line divides the square at the hypotenuse into two imports, each having the same area as one of the two legs being square
 aupchaarik pramaan ke liye, hamen chaar praathmik lemmata kii aavashyaktaa he: The simple idea behind this proof, which can make it easy to follow, is that the two squares above are transformed into a parallelogram of the same size, then folded and the left and right rectangles are converted to the lower squares, then continuous
 In area
 pramaan nimnanusaar he: This proof appears in Euclid's Elements as Proposition 1

 james e
 garfield ko ek upanyaas bijiy pramaan dwaara shrey diya gaya he: The entire trapezium is half of the left square, so its area = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 trikon 1 or trikon 2 prayek kshetrafal ab / 2 he
 The area of triangle 3 is c2 / 2 and it is half of the square on the hypotenuse
 lekin trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal bhi = - Hence the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 is pramaan main, karn par varg plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan ko anya do parshvon main virgon ke rup main jod sakate hai plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan
yah pramaan china se darj kii gai he
 From Euclid's proof diagram above, we can see three identical figures, each with a "triangle over a square"
 kyunki bada trikon do chote trikon se bana he, uskaa kshetrafal in do chote kaa jod he
 By analogy, the three squares are in the same ratio with each other as the three triangles and the area of the larger square is the sum of the area of the two smaller squares
 viparyay se pramaan ko chithran or anemeshan ke dwaara diya gaya he
 In this example, the area of each large square is 2
 donon main, charon samaan trikon kaa kshetrafal hataa diya gaya he
 The remaining regions, a2 + b2 and c2, are equal
 Q
E
D This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not preliminary, in the sense that it does not depend only on the most basic theory and theorems of Euclidean geometry
 vishesh rup se, jab trikon or virgon ke kshetrafal kaa sutara dena bahut aasaan he, yah sabit karne ke liye aasaan nahin he ki ek varg kaa kshetrafal uske tukdon ke kshetron kaa jod he
 In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem
 In fact, this difficulty affects all simple field-involved Euclidean proofs; For example, to get the area of a right-angled triangle involves an assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle of the same height and plane
 isi kaaran se, jyamiti ke liye swayansiddh parichay aam taur par trikon kii samanta ke aadhaar par ek or pramaan kaa prayog karata he 
 In the third graphic illustration of this Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse fits the square of the sides
 ek sambandhit pramaan yah dikhaa saktaa he kii punah sthapit bhaag mul ke samaan hai or, kyunki samaan kaa jod samaan he, kii unke kshetra bhi samaan hai
 To show that a square is the result, we have to show the length of the new sides equal to c
 Note that for this proof to work, we need to handle the way to cut a smaller square into more parts
 As the sides become smaller and smaller
 is pramaan kaa bijiy bhinnrup nimna tark dwaara pradaan kiya gaya he
 Looking at the illustration which is a large square with equal right-angled triangles at the corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle with C
 in trikon ke A-parshv kone or B-parshv kone anupoorak kone hai, nile kshetra ke prayek kone samakon hai, is kshetra ko ek varg banaate hue jiske parshv kii lambaai c he
 The area of this square is C2
 In this way the area of the whole is given: haalanki, bade varg ke parshvon kii lambaai a + B, ham uske kshetrafal kii gananaa kar sakate hai jaise 2, jo A2 + 2AB + B2 main vistaarit hota he
 The Buddhist theorem can be arrived at by studying the following diagram of how a lateral change can produce a change in the hypotenuse and using a small algorithm
 parshv a ke da main parivartan ke parinaam swarup, For a change in the similarity and difference of a triangle
 char ke viyojan par
 The result is the addition of a second term to the change in side b
 samekit detaa he When a = 0 then c = b, then b2 is "continuous"
 isliye As can be seen, this square is due to the special ratio between the changes and the sides, whereas the independent contribution of changes to the sides is the result of an amount that is not clear from geometric proofs
 is die gaye anupaat se yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he kii parshvon main parivartan parshvon se pratipanupati anupaat hai
 This differential equation suggests that this theorem is due to the related transform and its derivation is almost identical to the line integral computation
 yah maatra da or dc kramshah a or c main atyant chote parivartan hai
 But we use the real numbers Δa and Δc instead, then the ratio of their ratio is da / dc when their size is zero proximity, derivative and c / a are also close, the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangle and the result of the differential equation
 It shows
 is prameya kaa viparyaay bhi sach he: For any three positive numbers a, b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle whose sides are a, b and c and every triangle has a right angle between the sides whose lengths are a and b
 yah viparyaay euclid ke tatwon main maujuud hota he
 This can be proved by using the cosine method, or by the following proof: ABC ko ek trikon maanate hai jiske parshvon kii lambaai a, b or c he, a2 + b2 = c2 ke saath
hamen yah sabit karnaa he ki a or b parshvon ke bich ke kone samakon he
 We construct another triangle in which there is a right angle between the sides whose length is a and b
 paaythagorian prameya se, nimnanusaar he ki is trikon ke karn lambaai bhi c he
 Since the sides of the two triangles have the same length, a, b and c, they are congruent and therefore must have the same angle
 Therefore, the sides that have length a and b in our original triangle have a right angle between them
 paaythagorian prameya ke viparyaay kaa ek anumaan he kii nirdhaaran karne kaa ek saral tarika he kii yadi ek trikon samakon, obtyus, yaa acute he, is prakaar se
jahaan c ko teenon parshvon main lanbaa chunaa gaya he: a Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b and c, such as a2 + b2 = c2
 In other words, a Pythagorean triple describes the length of the sides of a right angle where the integer length of all three sides is

 Such triples are commonly written
 Some famous examples are and ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , One of the results of the Pythagorean theorem is that the unstructured length, such as the square root of 2, can be constructed
 ek samakon jiske pair donon ek ikai ke baraabar hai uske karn kii lambaai 2 kaa vargamul he
 The proof that the square root of 2 is irrational was contrary to the long-held belief that everything was rational

 Using mathematical induction, the previous result can be extended to a rectangular vector in a finite number of pairs

 Edsjar Dijkstra calls this proposal about the Akyut, right-angled and obtuse triangles in this language: jahaan kone α parshv a ke vipareet he, kone β parshv b ke vipareet he or kone γ parshv c ke vipareet he
 The theory of Euclidean geometry derives from the Pythagorean theorem, in fact, the Euclidean type of the Pythagorean theorem stated above does not occur without Euclidean geometry

 Using the mclaurin series for this cosine function, it can be shown that the radius r reaches infinity, as it is, the spherical form of the Pythagorean theorem approaches the Euclidean form

 The Pythagoras formula is used to find the distance between two digits in a Cartesian coordinate plane and is valid if all the coordinates are real: digits {2 + 2)
 But with complex coordinates: examples, digits {and {i The distance between, 0} will remain zero, which results in redactio ad Absurdum
 This is because this formula relies on the theorem of Pythagoras, which in his Huss proofs, depends on the area
 Is su and the area depends on the triangle and on other geometric figures that separate the inside from outside, which would not have been possible if the coordinates were complex

 Pythagoras, whose dates are generally dated to 569–475 BC, used the algebraic method to construct the Pythagorean triple, according to Proclos' commentary in Euclid
 Proclus, however, wrote between 410 and 485 AD
 sar thomas el

 dil-e-nadaan yaa dil-e-nadaan urdu-hindi kaa ek vaakyansh he jo uttar bharat or pakistan kii samskruti main bahut sandarbhon main prayog hota he
 It is a Persian phrase in its original form and it has دلِ ناداں written on it

 In the Indian subcontinent, the phrase was popularized by a ghazal of Mirza Ghalib, in which his heart is shown as aroused to a lover who does not appreciate his love

 18 june 1946 ko doctor ram manohar lohia ji ne goa ke logon ko ekajute hone or portugali shashan ke kilaaf ladane kaa sandesh diya tha
 The fiery speech of this revolution, which took place on 18 June, strengthened and escalated the freedom struggle
 goa kii mukti ke liye ek lambaa aandolan chalaa
 Finally, on 19 December 1961, the Indian Army invaded here and liberated the region from Portuguese domination and Goa was included in India
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he

 The flying Spaghetti demon is the god of Pastafari religion
 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai
 Atheism · Christianity · Hinduism · Islam · Judaism · Sikhism shri di purandeshwari ko bharat sarkaar kii pandrahavin loksabhaa ke mantrimandalmen maanav sansaadhan vikaas rajyamantri main mantri banaaya gaya he

 By the start of World War II, Rolex watches had gained enough prestige and British Royal Air Force pilot officers changed their low-end watches to buy Rolex
 However, their watches were confiscated when they were captured and sent to the prisoner camp

 On 10 March 1943, Corporal Clive James Nutting, who was one of the organizers of the Great Escape, wrote a letter directly to Wilsdorf, ordering a stainless steel Rolex Oyster 3525 chronometer, which he paid for that money, as a battlefight
 He said that he is collecting as a cobbler in the camp
 The watch was delivered to Stalag Luft III on 10 July with a letter from Wilsdorf apologizing for the delay, stating that an English gentleman like Corporal Nutting "should not even think" about payment until the end of the war
 Wilsdorf is said to have been influenced by Nutting because he ordered a Rolex 3525 Oyster Chronograph, despite not being an officer, while most other prisoners ordered a relatively cheap Rolex Speed king, popular because of its small size was

 Since the Rolex Movement has a serial number and a special mark was engraved on it after each servicing, the British police scrutinized Rolex's service record and identified Ronald Joseph Platt as the owner of the watch
 In addition the British police determined the date of death by examining the date on the watch calendar and since it had the ability to operate the Rolex movement for two-three days after inactivity and since it was completely water-resistant, those people reported little Set the time of death with error
 
 The Rolex watch is often a fake form that is illegally sold online and on the streets

 Only on the basis of the presence of low blood pressure, for which diabetes is treated, the disease can be diagnosed according to that
 Otherwise a trilogy of Whipples is required which includes essential symptoms associated with hypoglycaemia, low blood pressure, and once blood sugar improves, analyzing these symptoms

 The second factor is that, unless the sample is pulled into a fluoride tube or immediately processed to separate the serum or plasma from the cells, measurable glucose is slowed to a rate of about 7 mg / dl / hr per hour
 - In a controlled test tube in a small test tube, the metabolism will decrease, or even more, by the presence of shemostasis in the blood
 When blood is taken in a satellite zone and transported to the central laboratory for regular processing, the delay that occurs below the light levels of sugar is generally considered to be common cause in chemical panels

 The presence of both parts of this definition is not always straightforward, because the symptoms and effects of hemolytic anemia are unclear and may arise from other conditions; People in whom glucose levels are frequently reduced may lose their borderline symptoms so that severe neuroglycopenic dysfunction can occur without any symptomatic warning and many measurement methods are inaccurate at low levels
 madhumeh raktasharkaraalpata kai kaarnon se parimapit glucose evam raktasharkaraalpatajanit lakshanon ke sambandh ke sandarbh main ek khaas kism kaa rog he
 First, household glucose meter readings often indicate misleading readings, it is also likely that low readmissions are accompanied by symptoms or not, indicating actual hemorrhage, it is also likely that low readings are accompanied by symptoms or Neither, which indicates actual hemorrhage is higher in a person who takes insulin than one who does not take insulin
 doosraa, chunki injection ke jariye andar pravisht insulin ke "pravaah ko roka nahin ja saktaa" madhumehi raktasharkaraalpata main gambhir shaareerik vikruti ke viksit hone kii adhik sambhaavna ho jaati he, agar ilaaj na kiya gaya to, raktasharkaraalpata ke adhikansh anya roopon kii tulana main

 For all of these reasons, the higher, borderline of meter glucose is often considered "hypoglycaemic" in people with diabetes

 This leads people to use the supply in different contexts and for different purposes in different "cut-off levels" of glucose (by intercepting the supply)

 In the last days of the Mughal period, several Rajput kingdoms arose in different regions of India, of which Mewar, Bundi, Malwa etc
 are the main ones
 in rajyon main vishisht prakaar kii chitrakala style kaa vikaas hua
 Due to the characteristics of these different styles, he was given the name of Rajput style
 rajasthani chitrastyli kaa pehla vaigyanik vibhaajan anand kumaar swami ne kiya tha
 He wrote a book called 'rajput Painting' in 1916
 unhone rajput painting main pahari chitrastyli ko bhi shaamil kiya
 But now in practice, under the Rajput style, only Rajasthan's painting is accepted
 vastutah rajasthani chitrakala se taatpary us chitrakala se he, jo is praant kii dharohar he or purv main raajapootaana main prachlit thi
 Rajasthani painting, adorned in various styles and sub-genre, certainly holds an important place in Indian painting
 anya shaileyon se prabhavit hone ke uparant bhi rajasthani chitrakala kii moulik asmita he
 It has its own identity on the basis of characteristics of folk life, sense of sentiment, variety of subject matter, varna diversity, nature, environment, country time etc
 dharmik or saanskrithik sthalon main poshit chitrakala main lok jivan kii bhaawanaaon kaa bahulya, bhakthi or shringaar kaa sajiv chithran tathaa chatakile, chamakdaar or deeptiyukt rangon kaa sangyojan vishesh rup se dekha ja saktaa he

 rajasthani chitrakaaron ne vibhinn rituon kaa shringaarik chithran kar unka maanav jivan par padane vaale prabhaav kaa ankan kiya he
 In the Rajasthani painting influenced by the Mughal period, there is a special display of stately flamboyance, luxury, interpolation and display of flimsy garments

 is prakaar in chitron main vishay-vastu evam vaataavaran kaa santulan bana rahata he
 The main shape and background have equal importance
 rajasthani chitrakala main prakruti kaa maanvikaran dekhne ko miltaa he
 Artists do not consider nature to be the root and consider it to be a conscious entity having a negative connection to human happiness and sorrow
 chitra main jo bhav nayak ke man main rahata he, usee ke anuroop prakruti ko bhi pratibimbit kiya gaya he
 The art of medieval Rajasthani painting has become more captivating due to its natural beauty
 mughal darbar kii apeksha rajasthan ke chitrakaaron ko adhik swatantrata thi
 This was the reason that common life and folk beliefs got more expression in Rajasthani painting
 nari soundarya ko chitrit karne main rajasthani chitrastyli ke kalakaaron ne vishesh sajagata dikhaai he
 On the basis of geographical and cultural basis, Rajasthani painting can be divided into four styles
 ek style main ek se adhik upasheliyaan hai- Rajasthan is a very prosperous state in terms of murals
 yahan bhawan ke mukhya dwaar par ganapati ,dwaar ke donon ore baari akritiyaan ,ashwarohi ,ladate hue hathi ,sevak ,daudte oont ,rath ,ghode aadi dekhe jate he
 In Rajasthan, there is a special drafting method called the Arish to keep the murals alive for a long time
 is style kaa praarambhik praapt chitra "shravak pratikraman sutara churni" he, jise 1260 i
 main maharana "tejsingh" ke kaal main chitrakaar "kamalchandra" ne chitrit kiya tha
 This style began in the early 17th century
 maharana amarsingh ke rajyakaal main iskaa rup nirdhaaran hokar viksit hota gaya
 As many subjects were made in this style, no other picture was made in any other style
 is style kii visheshta yah he ki min netra ,lambi nasika ,choti thodi ,laal evam pile rang kaa adhik prabhaav ,nayak ke kaan evam chibuk ke neeche gahare rang kaa prayog
 Its principal painters have been Sahibdin, Manohar, Gangaram, Kriparam, Jagannath etc
 is style kaa prarambh 17veen shadi ke purvarddh main hua,parantu iskaa viksit swaroop 17veen ke uttararddh main hi sthir hua
 The marking of the lotus nines, whose bottom core is extended upwards, the rotation of the sloughs, the marking of round clouds in the Nilambar has its own characteristics
 unto kii sawari yahan ke chitron kii pramukh visheshta he
 The Jayapuri style is believed to be from 1600 to 1900
 savai jaisingh ke kaal main dilli se mughal badshaah aurangzeb kii beyrukhee kaa saamana kar anek kalakaar jaipur aaye the
 Initially, the Mughal influence on this style was considerable due to the Mughal painters coming from here
 is style ke chitron main purushon ke chehre par chot evam chechak ke daagon ke nishaan darshaye gayi hai
 The early period of this style is the middle of the 18th century
 yah badi hi manohari style he
 The beautiful nose like a parrot, the dhodi coming forward, the marking of the crescent eyes, the eyebrows like the bow, the marking of the picturesque lake have its own unique features
 rajasthan kaa sabase prasiddh chitra isi style kaa he,uskaa naam bani-thani he or isko nihalchand ne banaaya tha
 According to some scholars, this style was inaugurated in 1600 AD by the paintings of Bhagavata Purana
 raag mekh malhaar kaa 1606 i
 main chitrit chitra ko bhi bikaner kaa mana jaataa he
 This style began in the early 17th century
 attalikaon ke baahar kii ore ubhare hue gavaaksh main se jhaankata hua nayak isaki apni vishashata he
 Its painters are Surjan, Ahmed Ali, Ramlal etc
 sha devanagari lipi kaa ek varna he
 It is used in many words originating from Sanskrit, such as Sastha, Dhanush, Sushma, Agriculture, Conspiracy, Conflict and Suffering
 anterrashtriya dhvanyatmak varnmaala main iske sanskrit uccharan ko ʂ ke chinh se likhaa jaataa he
 There is a considerable difference in the pronunciation of 'sh' and 'sh' in Sanskrit, but in Hindi the sound of 'sh' is almost lost and is pronounced like 'sh', which has a half-sign
 
 sanskrit main 'k' or 'sha' kaa ek sanyukt akshar 'ksha' bhi prayog hota he
 The pronunciation of 'ksh' in Sanskrit is also different from 'ksh' although there is no difference in Hindi
 sha ke sanskrit uccharan ko bhashavigyaan ke nazariye se "aghosh murdhanya sangharshi" varna kaha jaataa he
 In English, it is called "voiceless retroflex frictive" or "voiceless retroflex sibilant"
 sanskrit main 'sha' ko 'sha' or 'kh' ke bich kii ek dhwani samajha ja saktaa he 
 Note that 'kh' and 'kh' are both intricate sounds and 'kh' is more common in Hindi than 'kh'
 is vajah se jab 'sha' kaa sanskrit uccharan hindi se lupt hua to kuch praakrit upbhashaon main 'sha' or 'ksha' ke sthaan par 'kha' kaha jane laga
 There are many similar words in Hindi in which two things have happened from Sanskrit: iske kai udhaaharan hai: There are many words in many of the Pashto dialects in which the sound of Sanskrit-like 'sh' is found
 ise pashto ke ښ akshar se likhaa jaataa he: dhyaan rahe kii urdu, farsi or arabi main naa yah dhwani milti he or naa yah akshar
 It should also be noted that in some Pashto languages, 'B' is pronounced instead of 'sh'
