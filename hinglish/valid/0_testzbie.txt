 Violent results that are said to be inspired by Hindu nationalism are called saffron terrorism
 yah shabd hindu dharm ko sambodhit karne vaale kesari rang ke payaiwachi se aya he
 The first use of saffron terrorism was in English in 2002, in an article in an English magazine called Frontline, to address the Gujarat riots
 lekin is shabd kaa adhik prayog 29 sitambar san 2008 ke mumbai ke maalegaanv dhamaake ke baad hua kyonki jaanch ke silsile main dhamaake se sambaddhit, kathith taur par, ek hindu sanghathan se jubie logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 However, the Islamic militant organization Indian Mujahideen was also blamed as it was suspected that the Indian Mujahideen might be involved in the 2006 blasts in the same area
 lekin, jaanch aage badhane ke baad kisi hindu sanghathan ke shaamil hone kii kathith taur par pooshti ho gai
 According to Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar was the first to use the word saffron terrorism
 iskaa jawaab dete hue pavaar ne kaha ki unhone sabase pehle maalegaanv visphot ke baad is shabd kaa upyog kiya tha
 There is not much difference between saffron terrorism and Hindu terrorism
 hindootv aatankwaad kaa bhi kabhi-kabhi hindu aatankwaad ar bhagava aatankwaad kii jagah prayog kiya jaataa he
 All three words are used in Indian media
 prasiddh patrika 'outluk' main hi teenon shabdon kaa baari-baari se istamaal hota dekha gaya he
 According to 'the National', any Hindu extremist, the alleged role of any violence against Muslims is addressed either by saffron terrorism or Hindu terrorism
 lekin subhash gatade kii kitaab-godses children main hindootv ar hindu ko alag bataaya gaya he ar vir saavarkar kii kitaab "hindootv" main hindu ko hindootv kaa ek chota sa hissaa bataaya gaya he, isliye hindu ko hindootv se bhinn bataaya gaya he
 Major Hindu nationalist parties, such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, began after the advent of the Hindu ideology
 lekin bhagava rang baudd dhram ke log bhi apanaate he
 Hence saffron terrorism is considered a misnomer and hence names like Hindu terrorism and Hindutva terrorism are adopted
 30 janvari san 1948 main ahimsawadi bhartiya sainani mohandas karamchand gandhi kii hatya ko hindootv vichaardhaara se prerit bataaya jaataa he
 Gandhi's only killer Nathuram Godse was a member of the RSS till 1940
 lekin gandhi kii hatya ko bhagava aatanki se prerit qaraar dene par abhi tak vivaad chal rahaa he kyonki sardaar vallabhbhai patel, jo us samay bharat ke grih mantri the, ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par pratibandh lagaaya tha
 But the inquiry commission and the Kapoor Commission gave a clean chit to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in 1969
 indian neshnal congress pravaktaa sanjay jha ke anusaar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne apane sevakon ko gandhi kii hatya se pehle 'kisi badi ghatnakram' ke liye intjaar karne ko kaha tha ar phir gandhi kii mrityu ke baad rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne mithaiyaan baanti

 The Pakistani intelligence agency considered the Shiv Sena a terrorist organization
 purv grih sachiv ji

 Hindu nationalist parties, which have been accused of supporting or supporting saffron terrorist activities, receive either open political support or perceived political support from the political party
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh, bhartiya janata party jaise raajnneetik party se apane upar bhagava aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ke samarthan kaa arope mitine hetu raajnneetik madad maangti he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh also gets political help
 vishwa hindu parishad jaise dalon ko bhi miltaa he bhartiya janata party se raajnneetik madad
 By giving political help to Hindu nationalist parties, it is easy to divide voters, due to which the elections can benefit

 The support of Vishwa Hindu Parishad also goes to the same party which propagates Hinduism ideology
 shri ram sena kaa niramaan 1960 main kalaki maharaj dwaara hua tha jo shivasena ke mahamahim bal thakare kaa dahinaa haath tha

 Sushil Kumar Shinde received heavy criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party for this statement
 susheel kumaar scindia ko sabit karne ke liye congress sarkaar ne 10 aatankwaadiyon ke naam jari kiye jinka taalluq rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or kai hindu sanghathanon ke saath tha
 Parties like Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal provide arms training to their members

 Hindu extremist organizations have been accused of carrying out several terrorist attacks, such as the 2006 Malegaon blast, Mecca Masjid blast, Samjhauta Express blast and Ajmer Sharif dargah blast
 do dhamaake ne samjhauta express ke do dibbon ko 18 farvari 2007 kii adhi raat ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha
 68 people were killed and dozens were injured in the fire following the blast

 Amrica accused Arif Qasmani, a Pakistani and allegedly lashkar-e-taiba financer, of the 2006 train blasts and the 2007 Samjhauta Express blast, and declared him an international terrorist by the United Nations
 2013 tak, bharat main kisi ko bhi is aparaadh ke liye sazaa nahin mili
 The Ajmer Dargah blast took place on 11 October 2007 outside the Dargah of Sufi saint Moinuddin Chisti in the city of Ajmer in Rajasthan, allegedly by a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh

 bhavesh patel, dusraa aparaadh main abhiyukt, ne bhi yahi kaha par baad main susheel kumaar scindia par ar kai congressi netaa par dabaav kaa arope lagaaya
 On March 8, 2017, the special court of the National Investigation Agency held seven accused, Gupta, Bhavesh Patel and Sunil Joshi, including the main accused, Swami Aseemanand, in the 2007 blast case at Ajmer Dargah
 29 sitambar san 2008 ko gujarat or maharashtra main teen bam dhamaake se 8 log maare gaye or 80 ghayal hue

 All three were made to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Nashik, who ordered the three to be held under police custody till 3 November
 28 oktober ko shivasena ne aropiyon ke hit main kaha kii yah giraftaar mahaz rajnatik he
 Suffixing this, the party pointed to Mkhia Uddhav Thackeray that there is a potential conflict of interest in the regional race as the 'national Congress Party' is handling the relevant ministry
 'naishnal jaanch agency' ko sadhvi pragyaa singh thakur ke khilaaf koi bhi saboot nahin mila or unke khilaaf saare arope giraane kii salaah di he
 Army officer Prasad was also accused of Shrikant Purohit

 But later he took a turn from his testimony and accused him of pressure
 hyderabad kii 'special investigeshan team' ne lashkar-i-taiyaba ke 'dakshin bharat ke commander' ko giraft main liya jinhen shaikh abdul khaja ke naam se pahachaanaa gaya

 Hakim Abul Qasim Firdausi was a Persian Persian poet

 In it, he wrote about Iran before Arabic Fatah on Persia in the seventh century

 He was 85 at this time

 main khurasaan vijay kar liya tha
 He was given only 20 thousand dirhams
 firdausi ke tan badan main aag lag gai
 He ran away from his country towards Hirat, but before fleeing, he added a poem to the Shahnama, which strongly condemns Sultan Mahmud
 shahname main firdausi ne iran ke puranic baadshahon kii, jinke karnaamon se vah atyadhik prabhavit tha, badi kii prashansa kii he
 His poetry reveals his love for ancient Iran and hatred for the Arabs

 He then returned to his homeland Tus and died there

 It is said that as his janaza was leaving the gate of a nearby village, a caravan arrived with 60,000 dinars sent by Sultan Mahmud, whose poet had hoped

 Mahmud Ghaznavi is said to have pledged to Firdausi that he would give a dinar for every word of 'shahnama'
 varshon kii mehnat ke baad jab 'shahnamaa' taiyaar ho gaya or firdausi use lekar mahmud gazanabi ke darbar main gaya to samraat ne use prayek shabd ke liye ek dinar nahin balki ek dirham kaa bhugtan kara diya
 It is said that angry at this, Firdausi returned and did not even take a dirham
 yah vaayada kilaafi kuch aisi thi jaise kisi kavi ke prati shabd ek rupee dene kaa vachan dekar prati shabd ek paisa diya jaye
 Firdausi angrily wrote a few lines against Mahmud Ghaznabi
 ve panktiyaan itani prabhaavshaalee thi ki puure samrajya main fail gayin
 a few years later, his trusted ministers requested Mahmud Ghaznavi that Firdausi be paid at the same rate that was fixed
 samraat ke kaaran poochne par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ham log samrajya ke jis kone main jate hai hamen ve panktiyaan sunne ko milti hai jo firdausi ne aapke viruddh likhi hai or hamaara sirf shame se jhuk jaataa he
 If he is given money at the prescribed rate, then we will get a lot of moral strength
 ' samraat ne aadesh de diya
 When a car full of dinars reached Firdausi's house, Firdausi's funeral was coming out from inside the house
 puri umr garibi, tangi or mufalisi main kaatane ke baad firdausi mar chukaa tha
 It is said that his girl, the only child of Firdausi, refused to take this paddy
 is tarah samraat kavi kaa karjadaar rahaa or aaj bhi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Firdausi's Shahnama is as famous today or more famous as the lines that Firdausi wrote while criticizing Mahmud Ghaznabi
 firdausi kaa 'shahnamaa' darasal iran kaa itihaas hi nahin irani asmita kii pahchaan he
 It describes the achievements of ancient Iran

 Years later, a young man claims to be the missing son of Lakshmi and Satyaprakash, and he attempts to bring some respect to the helpless Lakshmi
 lekin yah lambey samay tak nahin tikta he
 When Satyaprakash is released from prison, he recognizes the young man as his fellow prison inmate, and despite Lakshmi's shock and disappointment, asks her to leave the house

 It is true that muscle weakness is a primary symptom of various types of skeletal muscle diseases
 jaise peshidushposhan { / 0 or }peshivikruti sujan yah nauromuscular jankshan main hota he jaise myasthenia gravis 
 There are many symptoms of weakness such as: weak muscle, malaise, dizziness
 Fatigue
 The word weakness can be divided into two ways such as weakness and perceived weakness
 kuch sthitiyon main, jaise myasthenia gravis peshi shakti aaraam karte samay saamaanya raheti he, lekin kamajori mansapeshiyon ke adhik vyaayaam karne se hoti he
 This is also true in some CSI cases where the delay in recovery time due to muscle weakness after stress is measured and is also true, in some cases the published definition is a feature
 
 a state which lacks strength in the body or is lost either as a whole or in any of its parts
 General asthenia is caused by many anemia and chronic debilitating diseases such as cancer and is probably one of the most marked adrenal gland diseases
 fatiguability kii visheshta ke dwaara, shaktiheenata angon yaa angon ke system main simit kiya ja saktaa he, jaise netravsaad ke rup main

 It is often difficult to differentiate between psychogenic asthenia or true asthenia in muscle weakness and over time promotes pycogenic asthenia and many chronic weaknesses, major weaknesses
 tantrika kamajori madhya or paridhiy donon tarah kii ho sakati he
 The weakness of the central muscle is manifested as an overall physical or systemic, loss of energy, peripheral weakness as a local, specific-muscle inability to work
 tantrika kamajori madhya or paridhiy donon tarah kii ho sakati he
 Muscle fatigue for the central component is usually described with the help of a nerve-based stimulus that cuts the nerve conductor or commands the muscle to work, resulting in a drop in output power
 If work has been continued at the same intensity then it is suggested that reduction in neural conductors is a defensive mechanism to prevent organ failure during exercise
 kendriya thakaan kaa sateek tantra agyaat he haalanki serotonergic maarg kii bhoomika main ati mahasv hoti he Neural contractions are responsible for determining the number, sequence, and force of muscles to control muscle contraction

 Extremely powerful contractions are necessary to produce muscle capacity near the upper limit, and impatient fatigue may be a limiting factor in untrained individuals
 nausikhia samarthy prashikshakon main mansapeshiyon kii shakti kii kshamta utpann karne ke liye tantrika ke dwaara simit ucch aavriti ke sanket sabase adhik banaae rakhane kii kshamta rakhte he
 After the maximum contraction, the neural frequency indicates a decrease and strength arises due to the compulsion of the contraction
 vahaan na samvednaa kaa dard yaa koi asuvidha, mansapeshi aksar dhire dhire 'sunn' or band ho jaati he or peeche kii ore chali jaati he
 There is often a onset of muscle pain due to exercise, there is insufficient stress to stress the muscles and tendons

 This nerve training results in a rapid gain in strength over several weeks, which at once produces maximum contraction in the closed level nerve and the muscularis reaches its physiological limit

 The basic difference between peripheral and central theories of muscle fatigue is that the peripheral model series of muscle fatigue that muscle contraction initially causes failure at one or more sites

 It is therefore of opinion that chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive signals may be read by this central regulator
 in main se prayek karkon ke mahatv, thakaan-utpreran kaam ki pradarshit kiye ja rahi prakruti par nirbhar karegaa
 However 'metabolic fatigue' is a common alternative to the term weakness of peripheral muscles, which is not universally used because of the effect of direct or indirect reduction in contractile substrates in force reduction or because of accumulation of metabolites in muscle fibers
 
 This can occur through simple energy depletion of fuel contraction, or by the interference of Ca2 + potentials to stimulate contraction of actin and myosin
 ek baar yah mana jaataa tha ki lactic acid kaa nirmaan mansapeshiyon ke thakaan kaa kaaran tha
 It was hypothesized that lactic acid is a "pickling" effect on muscles and inhibitors of their ability to contract
 lactic acid kaa pradarshan par prabhaav ab anishchit he, yah mansapeshi thakaan ko sahaayta kar saktaa he yaa baadha de saktaa he
 As a by-product produced from fermentation, lactic acid can increase the intracellular acidity of muscles
 yah sie2 + tantra ke sikuda samvedansheeltaa ko kam kar sakate hai lekin saitoplasma sie2 + sanradata prabhaav ko bhi badhaate he jo ek avrodh ke madhyam se ekaagratha rasinic pump hajisame calcium baahar he yah kshamta peshi karrwai par ke + countaron baadha prabhaav karti he
 Lactic acid also has a sterilizing effect on chloride ions in the muscle, reducing potassium ions by reducing their inhibition of contraction and limiting the effect on muscle contraction only, although the effects of potassium are made by removing lactic acid chloride
 Is much lower than that of ions
 antat, yah anishchit he agar lactic acid thakaan bad jaati he yaa kam thakaan ke madhyam se vruddhi hui intracellular calcium sikuda protein kii samvedansheeltaa ke madhyam se kam karne ke liye + Ca 2

 New research from scientists at Columbia University suggests that muscle fatigue is caused by calcium leaking out of the muscle cell

 In addition, calcium is activated by a proposed enzyme that eats muscle fibers
 aamtaur par mansapeshi sankuchan peshishkti substrates ke liye hota he
 The molecules involved are adenosine tri phosphate, glycogen, and creatinine phosphate
 ATP binds to myosin and causes the filament to slip according to contraction]
 Creatinine phosphate ions are energy reserves so inorganic phosphate ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) can be rapidly repaired within 5-7 seconds from regenerated muscle cells, to allow potent contraction

 asadha kaa ek din mahakavi kalidas ke nijee jivan par kendrit he, jo 100 ipu se 500 isvi ke anumaanit kaal main vyateet hua
 The title of this play is taken from the opening lines of Kalidasa's work Meghdootam
 kyonki asadha kaa maheenaa uttar bharat main varsha ritu kaa aarambhik maheenaa hota he, isliye sheershak kaa arth "varsha ritu kaa ek din" bhi liya ja saktaa he
 a Day of Aashad is a triangular drama
 pratham khand main yuvak kalidas apane himalay main sthit gaanv main shantipurvak jivan guzar rahaa he or apni kala viksit kar rahaa he
 He also has an affair with a young woman, Mallika
 naatak kaa pehla rukh badalata he jab dur ujjayini ke kuch darbari kalidas se milte hai or use samraat chandragupta vikramaditya ke darbar main chalane ko kehete hai
 Kalidas falls into confusion: on the one hand he has a beautiful, peaceful and loving village life and on the other, the opportunity to touch the greatness by getting the support from the court of Ujjayini
 mallika to yahi chaahati he ke jis purush ko vah pyaar karti he use jivan main safalataa mili or vah kalidas ko ujjayini jane kii raay detii he
 Kalidas goes to Ujjayini with a heavy heart
 naatak ke dwitiya khand main pataa lagata he ke kalidas kii ujjayini main dhak jam chuki he or har ore uski khyaati faili hui he
 He is married to a charming and aristocratic woman, Priyangumanjari, in Ujjayini
 vahaan gaanv main mallika dukhi or akeli rah gai he
 Kalidas and Priyangumanjari, along with a group of their servants, come to the old village of Kalidas
 kalidas to mallika se milane nahin jaataa, lekin priyangumanjri jaati he
 She sympathizes with Mallika and says that she will make her her friend and get her married to a regent
 mallika aisi sahaayta se saafe inkaar kar detii he
 In the third and final section of the play, Kalidas arrives alone in the village
 mallika tak khabar pahunchati he ke kalidas ko kashmir kaa rajyapal bana diya gaya tha lekin vah sab kuch tyaag ke aa gaya he
 The hapless Mallika has become a prostitute by then and has a young daughter
 kalidas mallika se milane aata he lekin, mallika ke jivan kii in sachchaaiyon ko dekh, puri tarah niraash hokar chalaa jaataa he
 The play reaches the end at this place
 naatak ke ek sameekshak ne kaha he ke naatak ke har khand kaa ant main "kalidas mallika ko akelaa chhod jaataa he: pehle jab vah akelaa ujjayini chalaa jaataa he; doosraa jab vah gaanv aakar bhi mallika se jaanboojh kar nahin miltaa; or teesraa jab vah mallika ke ghar se achaanak mud ke nikal jaataa he
 "this play shows the huge cost that Mallika and Kalidas have to pay for Kalidasa's effort to achieve greatness
 jab kalidas mallika ko chhodkar ujjayini main bas jaataa he to uski khyaati or uskaa rutaba to badhata he lekin uski srijanshakti chali jaati he
 His wife, Priyangumanjari, is engaged in this endeavor to create a village-like atmosphere around Kalidasa in Ujjayini, but she herself never becomes Mallika
 " naatak ke ant main jab kalidas kii mallika se antim baar baat hoti he to vah qubul karata he ke "tumhaare saamne jo aadmi khadaa he yah vah kalidas nahin jise tum jaanati thi
 " apane duusare naatak kii bhoomika main mohan rakesh nen likhaa ki "meghdoot padhate hue mujhe laga karata tha ki vah kahani nirvasit yaksha kii utani nahin he, jitani swayan apni aatma se nirvasit us kavi kii jisane apni hi ek aparaadh-anubhuti ko is pariklpana main dhaal diya he
 "mohan Rakesh made this implicit guilt feeling of Kalidas the basis of" a Day of Ashada "

 The cultural traditions of northern India have a clear imprint on the Pallava dynasty
 ve pehle praakrit or baad main sanskrit kaa upyog karte hai
 He holds titles like Dharmamaharaj and Ashwameghayajin
 unki praarambhik shashanvyavastha satvahan paddati or antatogatva arthshaastra main pratipaadit vyavastha se sambandhit he
 But to what extent the northern origin of the Pallavas is proved from all this, it is difficult to decide
 pallvon ko brahman dronacharya or ashwatthama se sambandhit karanevaali anushrutiyaan to he kintu kadambon ke taalgund abhilekh main pallvon ko kshatriya gurjar kaha gaya he jiskaa samarthan huentsang bhi karata he
 Probably they were initially feudatories of the Satavahanas
 unhone kanchi pradesh naagon se liya hoga
 This event would take place after the middle of the second century, when according to the Talmis, the Nagas had the right here
 baad ke kuch abhilekhon main pallav rajvansh kii utpatti goorjaron or bharadwaj se bataai gai he
 Some of the initial names mentioned in these appear to be fictitious, but the historical basis of some events is also possible
 pallvon kaa praarambhik itihaas krambaddh rup se nahin prastut kiya ja saktaa
 On the basis of language for convenience they are divided into Pallavas known from Prakrit Tamrapattas and known from Sanskrit Tamrapattas
 inamen se sarvapratham naam singhvarman kaa he jiskaa guntur abhilekh teesri shatabdi ke antim charan kaa he
 Sivaskandavarman, whose inscriptions are derived from Mayidavolu and Hirahadagalli, dates back to the early fourth century and is most famous among the early Pallavas
 is samay pallvon kaa adhikaar krishna nadi se dakshini penner or bellari tak failaa hua tha
 Sivaskandavarman performed the Ashwamedha Yagna
 uske baad skandavarman kaa rajya hua
 The Tamrapatta from Guntur of Skandavarman, which is preserved in the British Museum, mentions the crown prince Buddhavarman and his son Budhyankur
 kintu iske baad kaa itihaas timirachchann he
 The king of Kanchi, defeated by Samudragupta, was named Vishnugop
 iske baad sanskrit tamrapatt ke pallvon kaa rajyakaal aata he
 From these inscriptions we know the names of many Pallava kings, but it is difficult to determine the relationship and sequence of them all
 kanchi ke rajvansh kii chhin-bhinn shakti kaa laabh uthaakar pallav samrajya ke uttari bhaag main nellore-guntur kshetra main ek samant pallav vansh ne apana swatantra rajya sthapit kiya
 The rulers of this dynasty known from the Tamrapattas can be placed between 375 to 575 AD
 kanchi ke mukhya gharaane ke liye sarvapratham ham chandlur tamrapatt se gyaat skandavarman, uske putr kumarvishnu pratham, pautra buddhavarman or praputra kumarvishnu dwitiya ko rakh sakate hai
 Skandavarman may be the Skandavarman of the Tamrapatta of the British Museum
 iske baad udayediram tamrapatt se skandavarman, uske putr singhvarman, pautra skandavarman tritiy or praputra nandivarman kaa gyaan hota he
 Their relationship with the previously mentioned Pallavas is not known
 kintu singhvarman kaa rajyakaal 436 se 458 i
 tak avashya rahaa
 The mention of Singhvarman and his son Skandavarman also appears in the records of his feudal Ganges
 chhathi shatabdi ke prarambh main shaantiwarman kaa naam gyaat hota he
 Probably the same was also known as Chandandand and Kadamba was killed by Ravivarman
 singhvarman dwitiya se pallvon kaa rajyakram sunishchit ho jaataa he
 The glory of the Pallava dynasty was started by his son Singhvishnu
 singhvishnu ne kalbhron dwaara tamil pradesh main utpann raajnneetik avyavashtha kaa ant kiya or chol mandalm par pallvon kaa adhikaar sthapit kiya
 He was a worshiper of Vishnu
 avanisingh uskaa virdohi tha
 He gave his encouragement to the famous Sanskrit poet Bharavi
 mahabalipuram kii varah guha main uski or uski do raniyon kii murtiyan prastar par ubhaari gai he
 Mahendravaman I, the son of Singhvishnu, is counted among the highest emperors of this dynasty
 is mahaan shaasha kii bahumukhi pratibha yuddh or shanti donon hi kshetron main viksit hui
 It was at this time that the struggle of the Pallavas and Chalukyas started
 chalukya naresh pulakeshin dwitiya kii sena vijay karti hui pallav rajdhani ke bilkul sameep pahunch gai thi
 In the battle of Pullalur, Mahendravarman defeated the Chalukyas and reconquered all except the northern parts of the empire
 mahendravarman ne kai virud dhaaran kiye jo uske pratibhashali vyaktitv ke anek gunon kii ore sanket karte hai, yatha mattavilas, vichitrachitt, chetthkaari or chitrakaarpuli
 Some of its rock cut temples are residual in Trichinapally, Mahendravadi and Dalvanur as examples

 He was also interested in painting and was also famous as a skilled musician

 To commemorate this victory, he assumed the title of Vatapikond

 He has described Tondamandalam and Kanchi
 narsinghvarman ke putr mahendravarman dwitiya kaa rajyakaal do varsh kaa hi tha jisamen use chalukya vikramaditya ke haathon parajeet hona padaa
 Mahendravarman's son Paramesvaravarman i has political significance in successfully opposing the Chalukya king Vikramaditya
 vikramaditya ne pallvon ke shatru pandyon ke saath sandhi kii or apane desh ke apmaan kaa pratikaar karne ke liye pallav rajya par akraman kiya or kanchi ko vijay karata hua kaveri ke dakshini tat par uragpur tak pahunchaa
 Parmeshwarman was not discouraged by his initial failures
 vipakshiyon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye usne ek sena chalukya samrajya main bheji jisane vikramaditya ke putr vinayaditya or pautra vijayaditya kaa parajeet kiya
 He himself defeated the invaders in the battle of Peruvallanallur and forced him to leave the Pallava Empire
 mahabalipuram kii kuch kalakritiyaan usee ne banavaai thim
 He was a worshiper of Shiva
 usne kanchi ke sameep kuram main ek shivmandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 The quiet and prosperous reign of Narasimha II Rajsingh, son of Parameswaravarman, is notable for the progress of art and literature
 uske mandir apane aakaar or sundarataa ke liye prasiddh he
 The Kailasanath temple at Kanchi and the temple at Mamallapuram are examples of these
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar prasiddh kavyashastrajna or gadhylekhak dandin isi ke darbar main tha or yaheen bhaas ke naatakon kaa rangamanch par pradarshanath parivartan kiya gaya tha
 The reason for the prosperity of this period was trade with foreign countries

 In the last years of the reign of Narasimhavarman's son Parmeshwarman II, Chalukya Crown Prince Vikramaditya attacked Kanchi with the help of the Ganges
 parameshwaravarman ne bhent aadi dekar akramanakariyon ko lautaaya
 Inspired by the spirit of retaliation, he attacked the Ganga kingdom but was killed in battle
 tiruvadi kaa shivmandir sambhavat: usee ne banwaaya tha
 In the absence of his descendants on the death of Parameshvarman, the state authorities, in consultation with the Ghatika of the learned Brahmins, sat on the throne of the twelve-year-old Nandivarman II Pallavamalla
 He was the son of Hiranyavarman, a descendant of Bhimavarman, brother of Simhavishnu
 pandya naresh marvarman rajsingh ne pallvon ke viruddh kai rajyon kaa ek gut sangathit kiya or chitramaay naam ke vyakti kii sahaayta ke liye, jo apane ko parameshwaravarman kaa putr kahata tha, nandivarman par akraman kiya or use nandigram main gher liya
 But Udayachandra, the commander of the Pallavas, broke the siege of Nandigram, killing Chitramaya and defeating other opponents
 kintu pallvon ke senapati udayachandra ne nandigram kaa gheraa todaa, chitramaay ko markar or duusare virodhiyon ko parajeet kiya
 But the worst calamity of Nandivarman was the invasion of Chalukya king Vikramaditya II
 gangon kii sahaayta se usne 740 i
 ke lagbhag pallvon ko parajeet kar kanchi par adhikaar kar liya
 But by not destroying the city, he gave donations and gifts to the opposite people and thus took revenge on them without frustrating the authority of the Pallavas
 uske shashan ke antim varshon main uske putr kirtivarman ne phir akraman kiya tha
 Dantidurga, the founder of the Rashtrakuta kingdom, also attacked Kanchi, but by demonstrating his power, he married his daughter Reva with Nandivarman

 starit shailavigyaan ke adhyayan kaa dhyey prithvi ke vikaas or itihaas ke vishay main gyaan praapt karnaa he
 Layered rock science not only provides knowledge about rock formations found on the surface of the earth, but it also provides a glimpse of ancient geography, climate and fauna and we can call layered rockology an account of the history of the earth
 starit shailavigyaan ko kabhi kabhi aitihaasik bhoumiki bhi kehete hai jo vastav main starit shailavigyaan kii ek shakha maatr he
 History contains a serial description of past events; But layered rockology also throws light on ancient geography and development
 pranivigyaani, jeevon ke purvajon ke vishay main starit shailavigyaan par nirbhar hai
 Botanists also get their knowledge of old plants through layered rock science

 Time has repeatedly tried to erase old evidence

 Thus, on the basis of the present evidence and the rules given above, three billion years old history of the earth cannot be written

 The main objective of layered stylists is to analyze, nomenclature, classify and identify the similarities found in rock formations at a place

 The goal of layered rockologists is to present a serial description of all the events that have occurred since the birth of the Earth

 apilarthi dwaara is pranali ke liye chunauti yah he ki - yah paryaton baadhit or videshi mudra kii kamai ko prabhavit karne main falswaroop parinaam he
 Apart from the fact that it causes difficulties for hoteliers and operators to provide accommodation for tourists booked by them for entry into their vehicles in the sanctuary which also affects tourism
 Some of the difficulties mentioned by the petitioner in operating the roster system at the grassroots level are that the owners of the vehicles are dark and what will come when their lurn days which are followed by and, therefore, they are obliged to mourn In the course to do it in the Forest Department office and its turn, inquire repeatedly about the habit which keep the standed vehicles in the office
 Some time the drivers and owners are not told about the fact that from where they have to go to pick up tourists for their journey to the garden, which causes considerable inconvenience; Drivers are not already informed since either they are not visible or lurn up to pick up tourists and this affects the pleasant visit of tourists to the park late, guides provided for the group of tourists Sometimes the language that the tourists think is dry, so they do not speak, they have been unable to convince them about the wildlife in the park and this also affected the tourism
 Let's write
 yah bhi topi baahar he bataaya gaya he ki vahaan sivaay roster system or open system ke bich zyada roster pranali main paryatakon ke liye van vibhaag dwaara pradaan kii guide ke saath vaahan main shaamil kiya ja nahin he or pasand ke anusaar he fark nahin he hotel maalik yaa daure yaa swayan paryatakon aayojan vyakti kii

 Since the number of vehicles in the open system are also restricted, they do not disturb wild life to a large extent in the park
 Therefore, it is that the roster system cannot be further promoted with the aim of protecting life better than the wild open system alone
 Vehicles, guides and drivers in both systems are from registered pools
 guide, vaahanon or driveron niyamon or sharton ke ek hi set se sanchalit kar rahe hai
 For vehicles guides and drivers they have to go on designated routes

 Under Section 28 of the Act of 1972, the Chief Wildlife Warden, on application, any person may enter one or allow to live in a sanctuary for all or any of the following purposes, namely or study of wild life investigation And for purposes of or incidental to, photography, scientific research, tourism: transaction with and legitimate business with any person residing in any sanctuary
 Therefore, the Chief has been authorized under the Wildlife Warden Act for the permission of any person entering the sanctuary for the purposes van anukool nijee shivi 


 rajasthan or anya rankon ke banaam rajya
 19 farvari 2002 par hereinabove is mentioned
 up 1972 ke adhinium kii dhara 28 ke khand neeche detaa he ki ek kii anumati pravesh karne yaa ek abhayaarany main rahete hai aisi sthiti ke liye jari kiya jayega or is tarah ke rup main nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa shulk ke bhugtan par
 isliye, abhayaarany main pravesh karne kaa adhikaar purna nahin he

 Therefore, it cannot be said that the conditions imposed by introducing the roster system would be contrary to the law
 There cannot be any way of doubting that the authorities may well be within control of their entry and the right to impose terms and conditions for entry into the sanctuary
