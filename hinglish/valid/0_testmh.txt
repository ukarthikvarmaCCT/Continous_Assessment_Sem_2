 raju kii aamadani khatm ho jaati he or puraa shahar uske khilaaf ho jaataa he
 Despite all this, Raju encourages and helps Rosie to become a singer and dancer
 or jald hi rozi ek star ban jaati he
 As soon as Rosie touches new heights, Raju starts loitering and becomes gambling and addictive
 ab phir marco waapas aata he
 With a mind of trying to win Rosie back, he comes to meet Rosie and brings a bouquet of flowers
 bich main usase raju takaraa jaataa he or raju usase phulon kaa guladasta le letaa he
 Marco tells Raju that Rosie has some jewels stored in a locker and that Rosie's signature is needed to be removed
 raju, is ashanka main ki yadi marco or rozi dobaaraa mili to unke sambandh phir na sthapit ho jaayen, loker ke peparon main rozi ke jaali hastakshar kar detaa he, lekin marco ko rozi se milane nahin detaa he
 Meanwhile, Raju and Rosie's relations get upset when she even refuses Raju to come to her and says that if Raju comes close to her, she will go out
 is se pehle donon main bahes huyi thi or rozi ne marco ko yaad kar kaha tha ki shaayad marco thik kahata tha ki mard ko aurat kii aamadani main nahin jeena chaiye
 In response, Raju says that it is Rosie's misconception that she has become a star on her own and Raju also has a big hand in making her a star
 kuch samay baad rozi ko jaalsaaji kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Raju gets a two-year sentence
 rozi ko yah samaj nahin aata he ki raju ne jaalsaaji kyon kii jabaki vah rozi se sidhe paise maang saktaa he
 Raju had taken such a step in Rosie's love, not for the sake of money, because he did not want to let Marco and Rosie meet
 ab film vartmaan main laut aati he
 On the day of Raju's release, Rosie and Raju's mother come to take him to jail but they find that Raju has been released six months ago due to good conduct
 rozi or raju kii maan apane manmutav mitaa dete hai
 After being released, Raju wanders alone
 garibi, niraashaa, bhukh or akelepan ke kaaran vah idhar-udhar bhatakta he
 One day he falls asleep in the compound of the old temple of a small village with a group of sadhus and the next day a monk buries a yellow robber over Raju before he leaves the temple
 agle din gaanv kaa ek kisaan, bholaa, pitambar vastra main sote huye raju ko sadhu samaj letaa he
 Bhola's sister insisted not to marry
 bholaa use raju ke paas laata he or raju use samajha-bujhaakar shaadi ke liye raji kar letaa he
 Bhola becomes even more convinced that Raju is a monk
 vah yah baat saare gaanv main failaa detaa he
 The villagers consider him a saint and bring food and other gifts for him and also tell him their problems
 ab raju us gaanv main swami ji ke naam se janaa jane lagata he or gaanv ke panditon se uske matbhed bhi ho jate hai
 While narrating a story to the villagers, Raju tells them about a monk that once there was a famine in a village and that monk kept a fast for 12 days and it rained in that village
 sanyog se us gaanv ke ilaake main bhi akaal pad jaataa he
 a fool of the village listens to something else during a conversation with Raju and tells the villagers that Swamiji has decided to fast for 12 days for the rain
 raju pashopesh main pad jaataa he
 At first, Raju opposes it
 vah bholaa ko yahan tak bataata he ki vah ek sazaayaftaa mujrim he jise ek ladki ke kaaran sazaa mili he
 But still the villagers do not lose faith in him and he gives the example of the infamous bandit Ratnakar, who later became famous as Valmiki
 antat raju upwas ke liye raji ho jaataa he haalanki use vishwaas nahin hota ki manushya ke upwas rakhane main or varsha hone main koi sambandh he
 But during the fast, Raju's spiritual development takes place and his fame spreads far and wide
 hazaron kii sankhya main darshanaathi usase aashirwad lene aane lagate hai
 Hearing her fame, Rosie, her mother and her friend Ghafoor also visit him
 gaffoor ko bholaa mandir ke andar aane nahin detaa he kyonki vah duusare dharm kaa he
 Raju intervenes and says that his religion is humanity, love and philanthropy
 dhire-dhire raju kii haalat najuk hoti jaati he
 Finally it rains on the twelfth day but Raju dies
 jahaan ek ore mandir ke baahar gaanv vaale khushi se jhum rahe hai vahiin duusari ore mandir ke andar uske swajan uski mrityu kaa matam manaate hai
 Live namankit Aakarnar, whose Bayer name is "alpha Aridani", is the brightest star of the Stotaswini planetarium

 Aakarnar is spelled "achernar" in English

 Keep in mind that both the Sanskrit name and the Greek name of the constellation in which it is located mean "canal", "river" or "flow" and the Aakarnar star is located at the end of it

 For this reason, it glows in blue color

 Therefore, Navic does not rely on any model to find frequency error and is more accurate than GPS

 However, Gandhiji also experienced English customs such as going to dance classes for example

 hindu, isai, buddha, islam or anya dharmon

 He returned to India after being called back to the England and Wales Bar Association but did not have much success in advocating in Bombay

 But due to the stupidity of an English officer, he had to leave this business too
 apni aatmakatha main unhone is ghatana kaa varnan apane bade bhai kii ore se paroapkaar kii asafal koshish ke rup main kiya he
 It was for this reason that he accepted the practice of advocating a one-year contract with an Indian firm in 1893 in Natal South Africa, which was then part of the British Empire
 dakshin africa main gandhi ko bharatiyon par bhedbhaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He was initially thrown out of the train for refusing to enter the third class compartment after having a valid first class coach ticket

 1906 main, zulu dakshin africa main nae chunaav kar ke lagu karne ke baad do angrej adhikariyon ko maar daalaa gaya
 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment
 is kor kii bagdor gandhi ne thami
 On 21 July 1906, Gandhiji wrote in the Indian Opinion of the Indian Opinion that a corps has been formed at the behest of the Natal Government by experiment in relation to the operation against 23 Indian residents
 dakshin africa main bhartiya logon se indian opinian main apane cholemon ke madhyam se is yuddh main shaamil hone ke liye aagrah kiya or kaha, yadi sarkaar keval yahi mahasoos karti he ki arakshit bal bekaar ho rahe hai tab ve iskaa upyog karenge or asli ladaai ke liye bharatiyon kaa prashikshan dekar iskaa avasar denge
 In Gandhi's opinion, the draft ordinance of 1906 was like bringing the status of Indians below the level of a resident
 isliye unhone satyagrah, kii tarj par "kafir s " 
kaa udhaaharan dete hue bharatiyon se adhyadesh kaa virodh karne kaa aagrah kiya
 In his words, "even half the castes and Kafirs who are less modern than us have opposed the government

 Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1918 in the Champaran Satyagraha and the Kheda Satyagraha, although the movements of indigo cash-paying food crops were also important, rather than the food crops necessary for his subsistence
 jameendaaron kii takat se daman hue bharatiyon ko nammaatr bharpai bhatta diya gaya jisase ve atyadhik garibi se ghir gaye
 Villages badly dirty and unhealthy; And was bound by liquor, untouchability, and veils
 ab ek vinaashkari akaal ke kaaran shahi kosh kii bharpai ke liye angrejon ne damankaaree kar laga die jinka boj din pratidin badhata hi gaya
 This situation was disappointing
 kheda, gujarat main bhi yahi samasya thi
 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized
 unhone gaanvon kaa ek vistrut adhyayan or surveykshan kiya jisamen praaniyon par hue atyaachaar ke bhayanak candon kaa lekhajokha rakhaa gaya or isamen logon kii anutpaadakeey saamaanya avasthaa ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Creating confidence in the villagers, he started his work by cleaning the villages under which schools and hospitals were built and the rural leadership was motivated to eliminate many of the social evils mentioned above
 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally
 gandhi ji ne jameendaaron ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan or hadataalon ko kaa netritv kiya jinhone angreji sarkaar ke maargdarshan main us kshetra ke garib kisaanon ko adhik kshatipurti manjuur karne tathaa kheti par niyantran, rajasav main badhotari ko radd karnaa tathaa ise sangrahit karne vaale ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 It was during this struggle that Gandhiji was addressed by the public in the name of Bapu's father and Mahatma
 kheda main sardaar patel ne angrejon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke liye kisaanon kaa netritv kiya jisamen angrejon ne rajasav sangrahan se mukti dekar sabhi kaidiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya tha
 As a result, Gandhi's fame spread across the country
 gandhi ji ne asahyog, ahimsa tathaa shantipurna pratikaar ko angrejon ke khilaaf shastr ke rup main upyog kiya
 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public
 gandhiji ne british raaj tathaa bharatiyon dwaara pratikaratmak ravaiya donon kii kii
 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj
 pardi main sadsyta sankethik shulk kaa bhugtane par sabhi ke liye khuli thi
 To improve the discipline within it, a Padasopan Samiti was formed to make the party not a single elite organization but to make it a party of the national people
 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation
 gandhi par giraftaar kiya gaya 10 march, 1922, ko rajdroh ke liye gandhi ji par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya jisamen unhen chah saal kaid kii sajaa sunaakar gel bhed diya gaya
 From March 18, 1922, he spent only 2 years in prison that he was released in February 1924 for an intestinal operation
 gandhi ji ke ekta vaale vyaktitv ke bina indian neshnal congress uske jail main do saal rahane ke dauraan hi do dalon main bantane lagi jiske ek dal kaa netritv sadan main party kii bhagidaari ke paksh vaale chitt ranjan das tathaa motilal nehru ne kiya to duusare dal kaa netritv iske vipareet chalane vaale chakravarti rajagopalacharya or sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne kiya
 In addition, cooperation between Hindus and Muslims was breaking at the peak of the non-violence movement
 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore
 26 janvari 1930 kaa din lahore main bhartiya swatantraaa diwas ke rup main indian neshnal congress ne manaaya
 The day was also celebrated by almost every Indian organization
 iske baad gandhi ji ne march 1930 main namak par kar lagaae jane ke virodh main nayaa satyagrah chalaaya jise 12 march se 6 april tak namak andolan ke yaad main 400 kilometre tak kaa safar ahmedabad se dandi, gujarat tak chalaaya gaya taaki swayan namak utpann kiya ja sake
 Thousands of Indians participated in this journey towards the sea
 bharat main angrejon kii pakad ko vichlit karne vaala yah ek sarvaadhik safal andolan tha jisamen angrejon ne 80,000 se adhik logon ko jail bheja
 The government, represented by Lord Edward Irwin, decided to hold discussions with Gandhiji
 yah irvin gandhi kii sandhi march 1931 main hastakshar kiye the
 To end the Civil Disobedience Movement, the British government agreed to release all political prisoners
 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was again arrested and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar

 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border

 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough

 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders

 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he

 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha

 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice

 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 His success in total control celibacy without first ladder to re commitment, almost failed

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe

 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart

 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God

 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice

 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa

 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both?

 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion

 Viewed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope, it has been found that M31 contains billions of stars, many more than our planetary planets whose number is about c
 200-400 billion
 
 While in 2006, the galaxy's planets were estimated at ~ 80% compared to Andromeda, which is roughly equivalent to 7
1 × 1011 solar planets, a 2009 study showed that the density of Andromeda and the Akash Ganga is roughly the same

 Charles Messier listed it as the M31 planet in 1764 and was erroneously credited as an explorer to Marius, who was unaware of Sufi al's earlier work
 1785 main, khagolvid wiliam harshal ne M31 ke pramukh kshetra main dhundhlee laal rang varna kaa ullekh kiya
 He believed that it was closest to the "great Nebula" and based on the color and size of the nebula, he miscalculated that it was no more than 2000 times larger than Sirius' distance
 1864 main wiliam hagins ne M31 ke varnakram kaa avlokan kiya or yah paaya ki yah gasiy nebula se bhinn he
 The spectra of M31 form deep absorption lines exhibiting a continuum of frequencies as layers that help identify a chemical mixture of a substance
 andromeda nebula bahut adhik alag taron ke spectra ke samaan tha jisase isaki utpatti hui jisamen M31 kii taarakeey prakruti thi
 In 1885, the supernova was first seen in the M31, which was seen only once in this galaxy
 us samay M31 ko sabase nazadiiki grah mana gaya tha, isliye vastu paas tha ek vichaar karne ke liye he, isliye is kalpana ko bahut adhik lokapriyata nahin mil saki or is asambaddha ghatana ko nova kaha gaya or iskaa naam "nova 1885" ke anusaar rakhaa gaya
 The first photograph of the M31 was taken by Isaac Robert in 1857 at his private observatory, Sussex, England
 lambii avadhi ke khulaase ke baad tarapunj kii sarpilaakaar sanrachana ko pehali baar dekha gaya
 However, at that time it was generally considered to be a nebula in our galaxy and Robert mistakenly thought that the M31 and similar spiral nebula were in fact the form of the structure of the solar system that was taken with the help of satellite Nessant planets
 hamaari saura pranali ke sambandh main is grah ke trigyakaar veg ko 1912 main vesto slifer dwaara lowell vedhashala main, spectroscopy kaa upyog karke mapa gaya tha
 As a result, at that time, its velocity was recorded very fast in the direction of the sun at 300 kilometres per second

 So he became the proponent of the so-called "island universe", the spiral nebula that was actually an independent galaxy
 1920 main, harley shorpale or curtis ke bich akaash ganga, sarpilaakaar nebula or brahmad ke aayam se sambandhit mahaan bahes aarambh ho gai
 In support of the claim that the great Andromeda Nebula was externally tarapunz, Curtis observed the texture of dark lines resembling foggy clouds in our tarapunj and observed a characteristic doppler shift
 1922 main, arnest opic ne M31 kii duuri ke akalan kaa ek bahut hi sundar or saral khagoleey vidhi prastut kii
 He placed our Tarapanja at about 450 KPC from Andromeda, which is about 1500 KLY

 Andromeda played an important role in the study of galaxies, as it is the closest spiral galaxy
 1943 main, walter bade andromeda akashganga ke kendriya kshetra main taron kaa samaadhaan nikaalane vaala pehla vyakti tha
 Based on observations of this galaxy, based on his observations about it, he was able to identify two stars based on their metallicity, namely the high-velocity stars in the Young Disc Type i and the Type II reds emerging in the Old Age

 Following this, it is found that the small galaxy passed along Andromeda's disk along the polar axis of the latter
 Its collision caused more than half of the smaller M32's bodies to break apart and create a ring ring in Andromeda
 M31 ke bade hue prabhamandal ke adhyayan se pataa laga ki isaki tulana akashganga ke saath karnaa sambhav nahin kyonki taron ke prabhamandal main aamtaur par "aparyaapt dhaatu" hoti hai jo duuri badhane ke saath-saath badhati chali jaati hai
 These evidences show that both galaxies follow the same evolutionary path

 cendrak kii chamak adhik chamkile golakaar jhund kii adhikta he
 In 1991, Todd R
 Lear used the WFPC and was later set up to take images of the inner nucleus of Andromeda to the Hubel space telescope
 cendrak main do sanyojaktaayen hai jo 1
5 parsek dwaara alag kii jaati hai
 The luminous valence is designed in P1, equivalent to the galaxy center
 P2 kii dhundhlee sanyojaktaa akashganga ke centre main sthit he or 3-5x107m☉ blike hole sthit he
 Scott Tramanne suggested that the interpretation of the observed double nucleus is possible if the P1 central black hole had a projection of the image of the star in the focal chamber around the stars
 uski utkendratha is prakaar kii he ki taare kakshiya apocenter se jude rahete hai jinke kaaran taron kii abhimukhataa main vruddhi hoti he
 P2 has a dense disc of hot spectral class a stars

 Whereas, at the time of its initial discovery, it was hypothesized that the luminosity of the double nucleus was the remaining part of the small galaxy "cannibalized" near Andromenda, after which there was no clear explanation
 iskaa mul kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke cendrak kaa kendriya blike hole dwaara utaar-chadhaav vaale vyavdhaan ke kaaran jeevankaal atyadhik chota ho jaataa he
 While partially resolving it is possible if P1 has its own stabilizing black hole, the upheaval in P1 does not mean that it has a black hole at its center

 globular 1 main kai taarakeey sankhya bahut adhik he or saamaanya golakaar ke liye inaki sanrachana bahut adhik saghan hoti he
 As a result, some consider G1 to be a small part of a small galaxy that was considered M31 some time ago

 In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely different type of star mass in M31
 khoja gaya nayaa tara punj main karodo taare shaamil thim or inhen vartulakaar punjon main iske samaan sankhya main anya taare khoje ja sakate hai
 What makes them different from circular groups is that they are larger - several hundred light years larger - and many times less dense than them
 isliye, taron ke bich duuri haal hi main khoje gaye vistaarit punjon main kaaphi adhik he
 Similar to the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy consists of satellite galaxies numbered 14 smaller galaxies
 sabase acchhee jaankaree vaali or sabase adik dekhi jane vaali upgrah akashganga M32 or M110 hai
 Based on current evidence, it appears that the M32 has a very close encounter with the M31
 M32 kabhi bahut badi akashganga rahi hogi jiske baad M31 ne iske taarakeey bimb ko hataa diya or iske antarbhag main taare ke nirmaan main badi teji ke saath vruddhi hui jisaki samaapti uske baad ho gai
 The M110 may also have come into contact with M31, and astronomers discovered metal-rich stars in the M31's halo that appear as lines from these satellite galaxies
 M110 ke dhul nahin he jo haal kii or vartmaan taare kii banaavat kii taraf ingit karata he
 In 2006, it was discovered that nine of these galaxies are parallel, dividing the core of the Andromeda galaxy rather than arranging their independent interactions randomly
 This may indicate a normal tidal origin for satellites
 andromeda akashganga, akashganga kii taraf 100 se 140 kilometres per second teji se bad rahi hai, isliye yah sthanantarit hone vaali neeli akashganga main se ek he
 The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are expected to collide after perhaps 450 million years, although its description is uncertain because the relevant velocity of Andromeda can only be compared to the Milky Way based on one or two components
 is takkar ke parinamswaroop ye akashganga ek vishalkay andakaar akashganga rup main parivartit ho jaaengi
 akashganga ke samooh main akashgangaon ke bich is tarah kii ghatnaayen aam baat he
 No information is yet available about the collision between the Earth and the Solar System
 yadi akashganga aapas main villin nahin hoti hai, to ho saktaa he ki saura mandal akashganga se baahar rakhaa ja sake yaa andromeda se jud sake

 yahan ke nivaasiyon ne 1857 ke viplav main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Chief revolutionaries among them were - Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan
 britaniyon ke viruddh kranti main sanlagn hone ke kaaran choudhary jabardast khan evam choudhary ulfat khan ko unke samarthakon ke saath mrityudand diya gaya
 But the residents of Hapur still remember their martyrdom
 hapur main 1857 main shahid hone vaale krantikariyon kii yaad main 1975 i
 se prativarsh shahid meley kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 Which starts from May 10 and lasts for a month
 sampoorn desh main 1857 se sambaddh is prakaar ke meley kaa aayojan anyatra kahin nahi kiya jaataa
 Chaudhary Jatir Khan's family was originally from the village of Asauda, who, due to their zamindari, later resided in Hapur's Muhalla Bhanda Patti
 choudhary jabardast khan, samast khan, ulfat khan, amjad khan, duulhe khan sahit saat bhai the, ek bahin bhi thi
 There was a friendly relationship between Nawab Walidad Khan of Malagarh and Chaudhary Zahit Khan
 "nawab validaad khan ke putr kii shaadi nawab mujffarnagar kii iklauti putree ke saath hui thi
 The procession left from Malagarh for Muzaffarnagar
 hapur raste main hone ke kaaran baraat yahan se hokar jaani thi
 On coming here, Nawab Walidad Khan sent Chaudhary tremendous Khan as the head of the procession and returned himself
 is ghatana se donon ke madhya dostana sambandhon kii pushti hoti hai
 The Nawab Muzaffarnagar gave a grand welcome to the procession and Chaudhary Jatri Khan
 baraat do maah se adhik samay tak nawab mujffarnagar ke yahan ruki rahi, jo vyakti baraat kii soochna praapt karne jate unhen bhi vaapis nahin aane diya jaataa, is kaaran baratiyon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho gayi
 In place of Nawab Validad, Chaudhary tremendous Khan performed the responsibility of the groom's father
 nawab mujffarnagar kii putree iklauti thi isliye nawab ne apni sampoorn jaaydaad apni ladki evam damaad ke superd kar di
 " hamaara anumaan he ki validaad khan kisi gupt evam ati mahatv ke kaary main lage hone ke kaaran putr kii shaadi main na ja sake honge or yah bhi ki yah kaam pehle se nirdhaarit nahin rahaa hoga balki achaanak lag gaya hoga
 If this particular work had been foreseen, the Nawab could have withdrawn the date of Validad Shah
 saath hi kaary itane adhik mahatv kaa hoga ki shaadi ke ain vakt par ve na to shaadi taal sakate the or na hi kaam ko wilimbit kar sakate the
 Finally, the question arises what exactly was this work? We believe that this work, and nothing else, must have been related to its plan or its planners before the revolution of 1857
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main sakshya samooh isi anumaan ko bal pradaan karata he ki shaadi kaa samay 1857 kii basant ritu ke aas-paas hoga
 By considering this one can easily guess
 itihaaskaar is par ekamat hai ki 10 may 1857 ko meerut se achaanak kranti prasphutit hui thi
 Therefore, it would not be evidenced that its eruption has a prior perception to Validad Khan
 atah saralata se is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ja saktaa he ki shaadi kii tithi 10 may se kuch purv nahokar hi kaaphi pehle rahi hogi
 On assuming this, father Validad Khan, instead of wasting precious time in his son's wedding, would have thought it appropriate to contact the planners and discharge their role in the revolution
 nawab validaad khan ek doordarshee vyakti the
 Contemporary historical sources confirm this
 1857 ke samay nawab validaad khan kaa malagarh riyasat main shashan tha tathaa mughal darbar main unhen vishesh sthaan praapt tha
 At the time of revolution, Emperor Bahadur Shah also handed over to him the responsibilities of Bulandshahr, Aligarh and adjoining areas
 1857 main mughal badshaah dwaara krantikariyon kaa saath dene ke kaaran validaad khan ne bhi unka saath diya tathaa angrejon ke viruddh apane kshetra kaa netritv kiya
 Chaudhary Zahir Khan, having close ties with Nawab Walidad Khan, fully supported the rebellion and led the revolutionary villagers of Hapur on a regional basis
 hapur tehsil main kai maah tak markat machi rahi
 The revolutionaries cut all the telephone wires between Hapur and Bulandshah
 validaad khan or jabardast khan ne hapur main britaniyon par akraman karne kii yojana banaayi lekin britaniyon ke samarthakon ev bulandashahar jile main bhatona gaanv ke jaaton ke kaaran yah yojana kriyanvit na ho saki
 Williams was eventually accompanied by a powerful British contingent to halt the increasing activities of revolutionaries in Hapur
 usne hapur ke angrej adhikari wilson kii sahaayta se choudhary jabarast khan tathaa unke bhai ulfat khan ko anek samarthako sahit giraftaar kar liya
 Many revolutionaries went away from Hapur
 angrej adhikariyon ne choudhary jabardast khan tathaa choudhary ulfat khan sahit unke anek samarthakon ko vidrohi ghoshit karte hue mrityudand kaa aadesh diya
 All the people, who were hanged near the old tehsil in Hapur, were cut in time
 usee vriksh ke sthaan par aaj hapur kaa telephone axenge bana hua he
 Its wall is adjacent to the Tehsil wall
 yah hapur main bulandashahar road par sthit he
 At that time, the silk cord was hanged
 aisa mana jaataa he ki choudhary jabardast khan ko teen baar phaansi lagaayi gayi parantu teenon baar hi phaansi kaa fanda tut gaya
 Seeing this, the British officer Wilson expressed surprise and made up his mind to leave the overwhelming Khan alive
 choudhary jabardast khan ko phaansi ke takhte se utaar liya gaya or unke pani maangane par pani pilwane kaa aadesh bhi diya
 But the opponents of overwhelming Khan did not want him to be left alive
 unhone british adhikari se prarthana kii, ki agar choudhary jabardast khan ko jivit chhod diya gaya to vah hamen jinda nahin chhodega
 Because he had helped the Britishers against the Chaudhary Tremendous Khan during the revolution, Wilson accepted his request
 jab jabardast khan pani pi rahe the tab unhone uski canapati par goli maar di
 Chaudhary became a martyr for the tremendous Khan country
 unki sampoorn jaaydaad jabt karne tathaa parivaar ke anya sadasyon ko mrityudand kaa aadesh bhi british adhikari ne diya
 Abdullah Khan and Wadulla Khan, who are said to be the sons of Chaudhary tremendous Khan, took away one of their loyal servants away from Hapur and after several years they returned when Hapur was peaceful

 As a result, in the later period of 1930, Dandi Swami of Benares named Gyanananda Saraswati came here and established a trust for Jyotirmath, whose care was on his organization Bharat Dharma Mahamandal and then he started searching for a virtuous stick for posting
