 a unit system, or policy, was a completely changed administrative system of Pakistan, under which the two different pieces of the then Pakistani land were planned to be governed as "one administrative unit"
 is tarah kii prashasnic niti ko apnaane kaa mukhya kaaran, sarkaar dwaara, pakistani adhirajya ke do vibhakt evam pruthak bhugolic aanchalon kii ek hi kendriya vyavastha ke antargat shashan main aane vaali ghor prashasnic asuvidhaayen, evam bhugolic kathinaayeeyaan bataai gai thi
 Therefore, as a solution to this geographical and administrative subject, the government formulated a policy to establish these two geographical parts as two administrative units of Pakistan within a federation framework
 iske tahat, tatkaaleen mumalikaat-e-pakistan ke, purvi bhaag main maujuud sthiti ke anusaar hi, pashchimi bhaag ke paanchon praanton va unki prantiy sarkaron ko bhang kar, ek praant, pashchimi pakistan gathit kiya gaya, vahiin purvi bhaag ko purvi pakistan kah kar gathit kiya gaya
 Thus, Pakistan became a state divided into just two provinces under a unit scheme
 van unit yojana kii ghoshnaa pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra ke shasankaal ke dauraan 22 november 1954 ko kii gai, or 14 oktober 1955 ko desh ke pashchimi bhaag ke sabhi praanton ko ekikrut kar, pashchimi pakistan praant gathit kiya gaya, jisamen, sabhi praanton ke alaava tatkaaleen, rajshahiyon or kabaili ilaake bhi shaamil the
 The province had 12 divisions, and its capital was Lahore

 The federal capital was shifted from Karachi to Rawalpindi in the year 1959, where the army headquarters was, and remained here until the completion of the new capital, Islamabad, while the federal legislature was established in Dhaka
 is niti kaa uddeshy bazaahir prashasnic sudhaar laana tha lekin kai lihaaj se yah bahut vinaashkari kadam tha
 Many states in western Pakistan joined Pakistan at the time of partition on the assurance that their autonomy would be maintained, but the decision to create a forest unit ended all local states

 ke takhtapalat ke baad mukhyamantri kaa pad samaapt kar diya gaya or raashtrapati ne pashchimi pakistan ke vikalp apane paas rakh liye
 Political experts also understand that the objective of uniting all the provinces of West Pakistan was to break the thrust of the linguistic and political unit of East Pakistan
 antat ek july 1970 ko raashtrapati yahya khan ne ek ikai kaa safaya karte hue pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton behaal kar diya
 The establishment of Pakistan was a result of the Pakistan movement, which was led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, so-called, to the Muslim population of the Indian subcontinent
 san 1947 main bhartiya swatantraaa adhinium ke paarit hone ke saath hi, bharat vibhaajan ke baad pakistan kii sthapana hui thi
 Under this division, Muslim dominated areas in the eastern and western ends of British India were included in Pakistan
 saath hi isi vibhaajan ke tahat, british-bharat ke punjab evam bengal praanton ko bhi vibhajit kar diya gaya or purvi bengal or pashchimi punjab ko pakistan main sammilit kar diya gaya
 Its territory consisted of five provinces of British-ruled India: East Bengal, Western Punjab, Balochistan, Sindh and the north-west Frontier Province
 har praant ke shashanprabhaar ke liye, pakistan ke maharajyapal dwaara, ek rajyapal ko niyukt kiya jaataa tha
 At the same time some princely states also accepted the proposal to join the Pakistani treaty

 The infamous and controversial Radcliffe Line was the line which was considered by both sides as the international border between the Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
 yah rekha pashchim main gujarat evam rajasthan kii seemaa se evam punjab ko vibhajit karte hue uske bich se guzarati thi
 Earlier this line used to divide Bengal
 vibhaajan ke baad, dharm ke naam par lakhon logon ne is rekha ke dono paar palaayan kiya tha
 Although Pakistan was conceived by Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 by a combination of four provinces and tribal areas in the northwest of India, gradually, this Muslim League politics grew and gained support in many Muslim-majority areas of India
 1946 ke chunaav main purvi bengal main bhi muslim lig ne bahumat praapt kiya, or isi ke saath yah bhi saaf ho gaya kii purvi bengal bhi pakistan main shaamil kiya jayega
 The establishment of Pakistan was a direct result of the Pakistan movement, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah
 tatpashchaat, kyonki us desh main koi bhi samvidhan nahin tha, isiilie pakistan ko 1935 ke bharat sarkaar adhinium ke antargat shasit kiya ja rahaatha
 After the partition and establishment of Pakistan, the administrator was facing considerable inconvenience in administering the two separate parts of Pakistan, which were isolated from thousands of miles of Indian land, in one place
 iske alaava, pashchimi bhaag swayan hi chaar praanton, kabaili ilaake evam vibhinn riyasaton main vibhajit tha, jabaki purvi bhaag ko ek praant tha
 Also, in the eastern part, compared to the western part, the system, bureaucracy and military security was very flawed
 tathaa, pashchimi bhaag tulanaatmak rup se adhik viksit tha evam uske paas badi sena va paryaapt naukarshahi va vyavasthapika thi
 Therefore, the path of development and prosperity was difficult for the eastern side, which had a comparable population to the west, and was ineffective compared to the west
 aisi sthiti main purvi hisse kii netritv ke man main bhashaa va saanskrithik muddon ke alaava, shaktiyon va suvidhaon ke bantwaare va samrik va aarthik samanta ke vishay ko lekar gambhir prashn the
 This one unit system was drafted to solve the difficulty of administrative and inequality arising out of this geographical situation, and economic hopelessness, under which only one province would be on both counts, so both would get equal political power
 saath hi, is yojana main anya viks nitiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Prime Minister Chaudhary Muhammad Ali passed the Union of Pakistan on 30 September 1955, on 14 October 1955, implementing the Act to unite all the provinces of West Pakistan and implement the One Unit System
 tatpurv, pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra ne 22 november 1954 ko isaki aadhikarik ghoshnaa kii thi
 The reasons were presented to the House by Iskandar Mirza for adopting this scheme: parantu is ek ikai kii sthapana saral kaary nahin tha, kyonki, ise kai guthon dwaara virodh kaa saamana kara padaa tha, vishesh kar prantiy sarkaron se
 The Sindh Assembly voted against the measure to create a province by the annexation of the provinces, after which the then Chief Minister of Sindh, Pirzada Abdul Seventy, was suspended by Ghulam Muhammad
 iske alaava, purvi bengal ko swayan is yojana se aapatti thi, kyonki unhen isse janasankhyikeey badlaav kaa dar tha
 However, after solving all these hurdles, this one unit scheme was finally implemented
 iske tahat, pashchimi bhaag ke sabhi praanton ko ekikrut kar, pashchimi pakistan praant gathit kiya gaya, jisamen, sabhi tatkaaleen praanton ke alaava tatkaaleen, rajshahiyon or kabaili ilaake bhi shaamil the
 The province had 12 divisions, and its capital was Lahore
 duusari ore purvi bengal ke praant ko purvi pakistan kaa naam diya gaya, jisaki rajdhani dhaka thi
 The federal capital was shifted from Karachi to Rawalpindi in the year 1959, where the army headquarters was, and remained here until the completion of the new capital, Islamabad, while the federal legislature was established in Dhaka
 haalaanki, is niti kaa mukhya uddeshy bazaahir prashasnic sudhaar laana tha lekin parantu bhashaai evam kshetreey-jatigat asmita va vikaas lihaaj se yah bahut vinaashkari kadam tha
 And, in addition to the provincial governments of provinces like the aforesaid, Sindh and East Bengal, it also faced criticism and strong opposition from the bhashwadi and regional-nationalist ideologues and politicians
 inamen ve rajgaraane va riyaasaten bhi shamil thea, jinhone is aashwaasan par hi vibhaajan ke samay pakistan main shaamil hone kaa nirnay kiya tha ki unki swaittata kaayam rakhi jaaegi lekin van unit ke aane se in sabhi sthaneey rajyon kaa bhi ant kar, pashchimi pakistan main sammilit kar diya tha
 In this regard, the states of Bahawalpur, Khairpur and Kat are particularly notable
 maamle us samay adhik gambhir ho gaye jab 1958 ke takhtapalat ke baad mukhyamantri kaa pad samaapt kar diya gaya or raashtrapati ne pashchimi pakistan ke saare shasnadhikaar apane haathon main le liye
 Many political experts also believe that the purpose of unifying all the provinces of West Pakistan was to break the emphasis of the linguistic and political units of East Pakistan
 kai raajnneetigyon kaa yah bhi prayaas tha kii pakistan ke vibhinn kshetreey paramparaon va samskritiyo ko khatm kar ke pakistan ko ek rashtriya samskruti ke taraf le jaaya jaye
 Therefore, from the end of various regional provinces, it would have been convenient to make the whole country a cultural unit
 atah is niti ko prantiy va kshetreey samskritiyon ko khatm kar, ek rashtriya samskruti ko badhaava dene ke liye bhi laayaa gaya tha
 It is also said that the real reason behind this plan was more "political" than administrative, according to which, the main objective of this move was to bring West Pakistan to the level of equal political power from majority eastern part
 haalaanki, jansankhya ke aadhaar par paporavi pakistan kii aabaadi adhik thi, parantu pakistan kii siyasat main, pashchimi pakistaniyon, or vishesh kar punjabiyon kii pakad va panth zyaad thi
 But there was a fear in the minds of political leaders that if according to democratic ideals, a system of political representation was established on the basis of population directly, then the whole political power of Pakistan would be concentrated in the east
 atah is sthiti se bachane ke liye, pashchimi pakistan ke saare rajyon ko sammilit kar, ek praant bana diya gaya, taaki uski kul aabaadi, purvi pakistan se adhik bahul ho
 It is said that this plan was brought to restate the votes of the eastern side only
 pakistan main doosraa marshall lau, 26 march 1969 ko lagaaya gaya tha jab raashtrapati ayub khan ne 1962 ke samvidhan ko niraakrit kiya or sena ke commander-in-chif general aagaa mohammad yahya khan ko satta saunp diya
 Upon assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan overthrew the one-unit system on popular demand in West Pakistan and ordered a general election on the principle of one man one vote
 issi ke saath ek ikai vyavastha kaa ant hua, or pakustan ke purv praanton ko behaal kar diya gaya

 The best lion of Ghazal is called Shahe Bait
 gazalon ke aise sangrah ko dewan kehete hai jisamen har harf se kam se kam ek ghazal avashya ho
 The first diwan of Urdu is the poet Quli Qutb Shah
 tukantata ke aadhaar par gazalen do prakaar kii hoti hai- There are two types of ghazals based on sentiment
 gazalon kaa aarambh arabi sahitya kii kavy vidha ke rup main hua
 The ghazals spoken in Arabic language were actually according to the name, that is, it used to talk to women or talk about it
 arabi se farsi sahitya main aakar yah vidha shilp ke str par to aparivartit rahi kintu kathy kii drushti se ve unase aage nikal gai
 In them, it was only about physical or physical love, but by expanding its meaning, physical love was converted into spiritual love
 arabi kaa ishke majaazi farsi main ishke haqiqi ho gaya
 In Persian Ghazal, the lover got the status of Sadiq and the girlfriend got Mabud
 ghazal ko yah rup dene main sufi saadhakon kii nirnaayak bhoomika rahi
 Sufi practice is the main practice
 isliye farsi gazalon main bhi sanyog ke bajaay viyog paksh ko hi pradhanta mili
 Even after coming to Urdu from Persian, the artistic form of Ghazal was accepted as it was, but the story became Indian
 lekin uttar bharat kii aam avadharana ke vipareet hindoostani gazalon kaa janm bahamani sultanate ke samay dakkan main hua jahaan geeton se prabhavit gazalen likhi gayin
 The name of the language was Rekha
 vali dakani, siraaj daud aadi isi pratha ke shaayar the jinhone ek tarah se amir khusro kii parampara ko aage badhaayaa
 Ghazals of Deccan Urdu were created in exchange for Arabic Persian with Indian symbols, poetic stereotypes, and cultural backgrounds
 us samay uttar bharat main rajkaaj kii bhashaa farsi thi isliye ghazal jab uttar bharat main aayi to punah usapar farsi kaa prabhaav badhane laga
 Even the best ghazals of Urdu like Ghalib continued to consider Persian ghazals as important and kept trying to make Urdu ghazal in line with Persian
 baad main daud ke daur main farsi kaa prabhaav kuch kam hua
 Iqbal's early ghazals are similar to this
 baad main raajnneetik sthitiyon ke kaaran urdu gazalon par farsi kaa prabhaav punah badhane laga
 After 1947, it started coming back again
 hindi ke anek rachanakaaron ne is vidha ko apanaaya
 Prominent among them are Nirala, Shamsher, Balbir Singh Rang, Bhavani Shankar, Janaki Vallabh Shastri, Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena, Trilochan etc

 After the homicide, Siddhartha wandered in the forest for seven years in search of truth
 yahan unhone kathor tap kiya or antat baishakh poornima ke din bodhgaya main bodhivruksh ke neeche unhen buddhatv gyaan kii prapti hui
 Since then, this day is known as Buddha Purnima
 buddha poornima ke avasar par buddha kii mahaparinirvanasthali kushinagar main sthit mahaparinirvana vihaar par ek maah kaa mela lagata he
 Although this shrine is related to Gautama Buddha, the surrounding area has a large number of people of Hinduism and they come with great reverence to worship here in the Viharas
 is vihaar kaa mahatv buddha ke mahaparinirvana se he
 The architecture of this temple is inspired by the caves of Ajanta
 is vihaar main bhagwaan buddha kii leti hui 6
1 meter lambii murti he
 Which is made of red loamy soil

 yahaan par bhagwaan buddha kaa antim sanskaar kiya gaya tha
 This statue is also a replica of Mahaparinirvana statue of Lord Buddha made in Ajanta
 srilanka va anya dakshin-purv asian deshon main is din ko 'ves' utsav ke rup main manaate hai jo 'baishakh' shabd kaa apbhransh he

 Apart from India, it was also celebrated on 8 May in some other countries
 thailand ke mahanikaay or dhammayutika maton ne 8; srilanka main 8 may ko manaaya gaya
 While celebrated in Singapore on 9 May
 thailand main ves Vesak Festival at the Mahavihara singapore main ves, 2002 Vesak Festival in Malaysia aakraamakata hamaare dainik jivan kaa ek hissaa he, lekin manovaigyanik aakraamakata ko sirf ek arth se bandhna mushkil he
 Aggression can take a variety of forms, and can be expressed both physically and / or verbally or non-verbally
 aakraamakata latin shabd agrarasiyo se aata he
 Aggression is studied by the scribes because it relates to animal interaction and development in the natural environment
 aakraamakata kii paribhaasha: sangya 1
 bal dwaara vishesh rup se uske kshetreey adhikaar; duusare rajya, ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan karne main ek rajya kii karrwai ek akaaran aakraamak, hamalaa, akraman sena kisi bhi videshi akraman ko rokane ke liye taiyaar he
 Any aggressive action, attack, or process; An encroachment: an invasion of one's rights prabhaavshaalee aakraamakata: kuch praapt karne ke liye aadesh se haani pahuchaanna
 Emotional aggression: harm to oneself
 aakraamakata shaareerik rup se evam manovaigyanik kaarnon se ho sakati hai
 Be due to physical genetic or instinctive intentions and psychological being in a situation or due to gender differences
 kai logon ko lagata he ki aakraamakata mul pravriti he
 Even if perhaps people have not read about Freud's death-instinct
 or agar padhaa bhi he to shaayad hi maut-vritti kii dharna ko sweekaar karen
 At the popular level, aggression is seen not so much as an extrinsic substitution of a congenital intrinsically directed destructive phenotype, but rather as a trait associated with a universally externally directed predator, possibly a survival instinct, in which animals are given to mankind
 Unites with kai logon kaa maananaa he ki maanav aakraamakata ko spasht samajhane ke liye gaiyr maanav pashu duniya kaa adhyayan laabhadaayak ho saktaa he
 Cornad Lolanz, whose 1966 book on aggression, made a major impact
 lobhainz kaa adhyayan vibhinn pashu prajatiyon, vishesh rup se machhlee or pakshiyon or thodaa gaiyr manushya-sadrush jaanavar par aadhaarit he
 Loenz observed a trend in these different species, protecting the area from attempting to encroach on other groups of his own species, defeating an opponent to find the female of his species and the newborn and young of his species and defenseless To protect the members
 lobhainz yah paaten hai ki aisi aakraamakata us uplabdh paryaavaran par usee prajati ke jaanwaron main 'santulit vitaran' kaa kaary karti he
 And it strengthens and continually improves the gene-pool, and increases the likelihood of neonatal and young members of life
 in teen tareekon se, aakraamakata prajatiyon ko niyamit rup se ise yah paryaavaran ke liye adhik anukool evam sudhaaraney main madad karti he
 Lozenz also attributes aggression to an important role in the development of social structures
 aakraamakata ek pravriti ko maanane vaale bhedak prabhaav ko aakraamakata kii abhivyakti kaa kaaran maanate hai
 Empirical research, however, casts doubt on this
 durbhaagya se bhedak prabhaav ke siddhant ko maanane vaale galat siddh huai
 Couples who argue among themselves are more likely to become violent
 jo pati apni patniyon ko dhakka dete hai un main apni patniyon ko thappad or mukka maarane kii sabase adhik sambhaavna rahati hai
 The best predictor of a person's likelihood of committing violence this year is his previous year's history of criminal violence
 hinsa se hinsa paidaa ho rahi he bajaay iske kii vah kam ho
 The second theory of aggression considers the stimuli of the extrinsic form of innate antecedents as sources of aggression
 kendriya kalpana yah he ki aakraamakata paribhaashit uttejnaaon, paribhaashit uttejnaa jise hataasha kehete he
 In classical texts, Dollard and his colleagues initially coined a bold two-part assertion, stating that 'the cause of aggressive behavior is always assumed to be frustration', and that 'frustration always leads to aggression
 It gives birth in some form
 "maanav vyavhaar jatil or bahuaiami he; koi bhi uttejnaa kii hameshaa ek vishisht vyavhaarik pratikriya hogi yaa vishisht vyavhaarik pratikriya se pehle vahi khaas uttejnaa ghati yah kalpana karnaa asaamaanya or saahsee he
 And, in fact, Dollard and his collaborators were ready for criticism from the start
 dollard or unke sahyogi hataasha ko is rup main paribhaashit karaten hai "vyavhaar kram main uchit samay par ek uksaaya lakshya-pratikriya kii ghatana ke saath ek hastkshep”
 It is possible that we are not familiar with language such as "goal response by provocation"
 ham aasaani se apane sangharshon ke anubhavon se samaj sakate he – thake haare kaam se ghar aane ke pashchaat bhojane naa milanaa, jisaki vah hakdaar ho vah padonnati nahin milanaa, wo baccha jise skool main khel ke maidan par khilne se baahar rakhaa gaya ho
 Barkowitz uses two changing interruptions, anger and explanation
 vah yah prastaav rakhte he ki "har hataasha aakraamakata ko or uksaava pradaan karti he or badhaati he, lekin is uksaave ko yahan krodh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he, or krodh keval aakraamakata ko janm degaa "jab upyukt sanket yaa kaaran maujuud hon
 Here, Barkowitz allows individuals to learn that it is inappropriate to express anger aggressively and therefore reduce the likelihood of aggression even when the encouragement of frustration is intense
 manvi hinsa karne kii kshamta kaa praathmik strot kuntha-aakraamakata hona jaan padataa he
 Despair is not necessarily the cause of violence, for some individuals expectation of profit motivates them to commit violence
 haalanki kaaran khyaal kiye bina hataasha se, prerit gussa, vyaktiyon ko aakraamak hone ko prerit karata he, yadi kuntha paryaapt rup se lambey samay tak rahe yaa teji se mahasoos ki jaae, to yadi nishchit nahin to aakraamakata ghatit hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna rahegi
 In this sense, the mechanism of frustration-aggression is similar to gravity: the intensity of the innate nature of violence in frustrated individuals is proportional to their frustration
 kai kaaran hai jo vyaktiyon ke vyavhaar ko vibhinn paristhitiyon main prabhavit karaten hai: vyaktiyon ke liye unke vishwaason, asthon, sankoch or saamaajik vaataavaran
 The properties of gravity, energy and the medium for the objects in which they are located
 lekin un vyaktiyon ke gun ke sandarbh vichaar karnaa bhi kam sambhav lagata he jo raajnneetik hinsa ke logon ko uttejit karte hai
 In the same way as to ignore the principle of gravity for the construction of aircraft
 is skool kii daleel ko yah sweekaar nahin he ki aakraamakata swaabhaavik rup se hataasha kii vajah se he, balki aakraamakata mote taur par ek siikhaa haa vyavhaar he
 Followers of this school believe that aggression is largely absent in many societies or that aggressive behavior is imitated while there is no provoking frustration
 albert bandura aakraamakata ke saamaajik adhigam siddhant ke ek pramukh shodhakarta, vichaarak or navonmesh he
 Their experiment, for example, has shown that children who view aggressive adult models also imitate this behavior in a completely new situation
 duusari taraf niyantrit samooh ke bachche aisa nahin karte hai, or pun: is hi prakaar hoga jab model film par honge
 Albert and Walters have reported similar observations and studies in social and personality development
 is skool kaa aakraamakata par soch ke nishkarsh ko is tarah abhivyakt kiya gaya he: "maanav aakraamakata ek siikhaa aacharan he, jaise ki, anya tarah ke saamaajik vyavhaar, uttejnaa, sudrudheekaran, ke antargat he or sangyanatmak niyantran
" How did people learn not to be aggressive? a model in his view presented by Patricia Draper is of child rearing practices of the Kung Kalahari Desert
 draper us paryaavaran main jisamen bacchon ko aakraamak pratikriyaayein se nirutsahit karne ke kam se kam teen pahaluon ko ingit karatin hai: 1
 "when two young children start arguing or fighting, adults do not punish or learn them; they separate the children and take each child in an opposite direction
" vayask unako shant karne kii koshish karte hai or vichlit bachche ko anya chizon main dilchaspee dikhaane ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 "A similar intervention is used by the device with older children, calling the group leader away or adults joining the older children group
 2
 “bade paimaane main vayask shaareerik dand, or akramak mudra upyog nahin karte or vayask samaaj dwaara akramak mudra ke upyog se parhez va uskaa avamulyan kiya jaae” 3
 "continually ignoring the explosion of the child by adults if it does not harm
" aise samay main ek bachche kii hataasha teevr, hoti he, lekin vah sikhta he ki krodh kaa pradarshan vayask kii dhyaan yaa sahanubhuti praapt karne ke liye nahin he
 " jis tarah se hataasha-aakraamakata pariklpana kaa sanshodhit sanskaran ek vyakti ko aakraamakata ke jawaab main madhyasthata karnaa seekhney main kuch prabhaav daalata he
 Therefore social education theorists believe that the person who has learned aggressive reactions is more likely to use the same person
 asal main, ve hataasha ko aakraamak vyavhaar ko bhadakaanewaala ek sambhavit kaaran ke rup main dekhte hai, lekin is baat par jor dete hai ki aakraamakata saamaajik vyavhaar se sikhi jaati he bajaay iske ki aakraamakata yaa kisi bhi anya protsaahan ke liye ek swat: pratikriya he
 Finally, we have identified three specific forms of aggression that often occur in society
 is sadi ke shuru main aakraamakata main ek asaamaanya vruddhi hui he, jis ke parinaam swaroop mana ja rahaa he aatanki gatividhiyon kii sankhya main abhootpurv vruddhi dekhi gai he

 si ek saamaanya upyog main aane vaali computer kii programmen bhashaa he
 It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratory in 1972 with the aim of building a Unix operating system
 is samay 'si' pehali yaa duusari sarvaadhik lokapriy programing bhashaa he
 This language is used extensively on various software platforms
 shaayad hi koi computer-platform ho jiske liye si kaa compiler uplabdh na ho
 The deep impact of c language can be seen on many programming languages like c ++, Java, c # etc
 san 1960 main cambridge vishvavidhyalay ne ek computer programing bhashaa kaa vikaas kiya jise unhone BASIC COMBINED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE naam diya
 It was called b in the language of common language
 ’bi’ bhashaa ko san 1972 main bell prayogshaala main computer vaigyanik danish richi dwaara sanshodhit kiya gaya
 The 'C' programming language is a modified form of the 'B' programming language
 ’si’ ko unics oparating system or dos oparating system dono main prayog kiya ja saktaa he, antar maatr compiler kaa hota he
 Unix operating system is the operating system written in 'C'
 yah visheshat: ’si’ ko prayog karne ke liye hi banaaya gaya he at: adhiktar ’si’ kaa prayog unics oparating system par hi kiya gaya he
 The C-language is available as a number of sub-languages with minor differences
 america rashtriya maanak santhaan dwaara viksit ANSI c ko adhiktar maanak mana jaataa he
 The most important feature of this programming language is that it has all the properties of a high level programming language, as well as all the properties of a low level language
 ucch stareey bhashaaen fortron, cobol bhi he lekin isame nimna stareey bhashaa ke gun nahin paae jate
 The speed of the programs designed in this programming language is relatively fast
 yah 0 se 15000 tak ginaney main lagbhag ek second kaa samay lagaati he jabaki basic main is kaary main lagbhag 50 second lagate he
 In 'C' programming language many functions are defined for use in the program, but an additional feature is that the programmer can also define new functions as per his requirement
 isame maatr 32 kii shabdon kaa prayog hota he iske saath hi isame anek anya sahaayak program bhi hote he jisaki sahaayta se jatil functions bhi safaltaapurvak kiye ja sakate he
 It mainly deals with mathematics, science and systems related work
 is bhashaa main nirdesh dete samay lower case letters kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the above features, 'C' is a very popular computer programming language
 isse pehle ham yah jaan chuke hai koi bhi char sanganak kii memory main kis tarah se sangrakshit hota he
 Where this variable is preserved it also has a fixed address that tells where the value of the variable is preserved in memory
 is pate ko hi pointer kehete hai
 The c / c ++ programming language also has the feature that the address of a variable can be determined
 c / C++ programmen bhashaa main bhi char kaa pataa jaanane ke liye & kaa upyog karte hai
 For example, if there is an integer variable x, the address of x will match with & x
 jis prakaar purnank, akshar, vaastavik sankhya ityadi ko char main sangrakshit kiya jaataa hai usee tarah kisi char ke pattey ko bhi
 For this, a new datatype is used to preserve the address in the same way that int datatype is used to preserve integers
 kisi purnank char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye int* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 Similarly, characters use char * datatype to preserve the address of a variable
 neeche ek chota sa udhaaharan yah diya gaya he jisamen ek char main duusare char kaa pataa sangrakshit karte hai
 Here first an integer variable x is defined, then p is defined a variable that preserves the address of an integer
 phir p char main x kaa pataa daal diya he
 Address → 0 1 2 3 4 Memory → 1 xxrep 4 0 111 11100101 00100110 xxrep 4 0 101 01100101
 
 
 ↑ p = & x = 3 int x Now the variable is an integer pointer p in which the address of variable x is preserved, that is, the address of x will be written when p is written
 yadi hamen yah jaananaa he ki p main jis memory kaa pataa likhaa hua us memory par kya sangrakshit he to *p kaa upyog karte hai karne ke liye hame ek main function avashya likhnaa hota he
 Because 'C' compiler starts executing any program from main function
 ek sanchika athwa ek program main ek se adhik main function nahin ho sakate
 It is an user defined function
 main function ko ’{’ koshthak dwaara aarambh kiya jaataa he
 At the time of execution of the program file '{' indicates that the execution has to start from here
 isi prakaar ’}’ yah bataata he ki nishpaadan yahan samaapt hona he
 In a program, the main function remains the same, but other functions can be used
 prayek function ke liye { or }ke madhya upaprogram diya jaataa he
 End semicolon of each instruction ';' Must be by is program ko chalaane par iskaa output nimnavat hoga: Another example 1918 main rus se swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad, esthonia pehali baar 1920 ke greeshmakaleen olympic main ek raashtra ke rup main bhaag liya, haalanki 1923 main rashtriya olympic samiti kii sthapana hui thi
 The first Winter Olympics was the 1924 Winter Olympics
 esthonian athleton ko olympic khelon main bhaag liya jab tak desh par akraman kiya gaya tha or 1940 main soviet sangh dwaara kabja kar liya
 The 1980 Summer Olympic sailing was held in Reguta, the capital city of Tallinn

 The reason for separating from Fried was that Fried put more emphasis on work and libido in every field

 These are often mixed in the ratio 1: 3
 ise amlaraj yaa 'aiquarejia' naam isaliye diya gaya kyonki yah swarna or platinum aadi 'nobel dhaatuon' ko bhi galaa detaa he
 However, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, tatalum, osmium, rhodium and some other metals do not dissolve it
 jab sandra hydrochloric amla or sandra nitric amla ko aapas main milaayaa jaataa he tab rasinic abhikriya hoti he
 As a result of this reaction, volatile nitrosyl chloride and chlorine are formed, which is evident from the smoke emanating from the acid and the characteristic yellow color of the acid

 Nitrosyl chloride can be decomposed into nitric oxide and chlorine

 The analysis and interpretation of the organ suffixes of any language is called grammar
 vyakaran vah vidya he jiske dwaara kisi bhashaa kaa shuddh bolnaa, shuddh padhanaa or shuddh likhnaa aata he
 There are definite rules for writing, reading and speaking of any language
 bhashaa kii shuddhta va sundarataa ko banaae rakhane ke liye in niyamon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak hota he
 These rules also come under grammar
 vyakaran bhashaa ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 The analysis and analysis of the organ suffixes of any "language" is called "grammar", such as the analysis and interpretation of the body part suffix "physiology" and the description of a country, etc
 "geography"
 yani vyakaran kisi bhashaa ko apane aadesh se nahin chalaata ghumata, pratyut bhashaa kii sthiti pravriti prakat karata he
 "moves" is a verb and everyone reads it the same way without reading grammar; Let's understand its true meaning
 vyakaran is pad kaa vishleshan karke batayega ki isamen do avyav hai - "chalata" or "he"
 Then he will also analyze these two ingredients and tell that "chala" and "hai" also have their components
 "chal" main do varna spasht hai; parantu vyakaran spasht karegaa ki "c" main do akshar he "ch" or "a"
 Similarly "L" and "A" in "L"
 ab in aksharon ke tukade nahin ho sakate; "akshar" hai ye
 Grammar will also classify these letters, "consonants" and "vowels"
 "ch" or "l" vyanjan hai or "a" swar
 The vowels in Chi, Chi and Li, Li are "I" and "E", consonants "ch" and "L"
 is prakaar kaa vishleshan bade kaam kii cheez he; vyarth kaa gorakhdhandha nahin he
 This analysis is "grammar"
 vyakaran kaa doosraa naam "shabdanushasan" bhi he
 He disciplines words - tells us how to use a word
 bhashaa main shabdon kii pravriti apni hi rahati he; vyakaran ke kehane se bhashaa main shabd nahin chalate
 But according to the tendency of the language, grammar dictates word usage
 yah bhashaa par shashan nahin karata, uski sthitipravriti ke anusaar lokshikshan karata he
 Although multi-nadhis, however, Patha Putra Grammar
 swajano shwajano maabhutsakalan shakalan sakrutshkrut
 Read it so that 'kinsman' does not become 'dog' and 'gross' does not become 'face' and 'active' does not become 'powerful'
 ) Where was the first "grammar" science born in the world? sansar ke bhashavidon ne ekamat se sweekaar kiya he ki is prithvi par uplabdh sahitya main sabase pracheen veda he
 The Rigveda is the oldest literature in the world
 jab koi bhashaa sahitya kii samruddhi se jagamagane lagati he, tab uske vyakaran kii jarurat padati he
 What important literature is "veda", it can be understood from this that man has embraced it for so many days and has protected it like life
 uske prayek mantra ko yathasthit rup main kanthsth rakhana or bahut kuch uski "dhwani" surakshit rakhana saral kaam nahin he
 The ascetic Brahmins have protected the Vedas by chewing dried gram
 tabhi to ve bane rahe
 Grammar of important literature like Vedas was needed
 vyakaran ke sahare sudur desh pradeshon ke gyanpipasu kahin anyatra udbhut sahitya ko samaj sakate hai or anant kaal biit jane par bhi log use samajhane main sakasham rahete hai
 Literature like Vedas is not bound by the boundaries of the country; Hence enlightened "dev" people prayed to their king- "the grammar of our language should be formed
 aap hamaari bhashaa kaa vyakaran bana den
 "till then the Vedbhasha was" avyakrita "; this is how people were using it
 indra ne "varam" kahkar devon kii prarthana sweekaar kar lee or phir padon ko bich se tod todakar prakruti pratyay aadi kaa bhed kiya-vyakaran ban gaya
 Thus the first "grammar" lore in India was born
 vyakaran se bhashaa kii gati nahin rukati, jaisaa pehle kaha gaya he; or na vyakaran se vah badalati hi he
 Does the geography of a country state change its movement there? Language moves at its own pace
 vyakaran uskaa na niamak he, na avarohak hi
 Yes, after thousands of years, when a language comes in some other form, then that grammar becomes unusable for this
 tab is kaa pruthak vyakaran banegaa
 That old grammar will still not become useless; Will continue to give an accurate introduction to that old language
 yah saadhaaran upyogita nahin he
 Yes, if someone makes the grammar of a language wrong by his ignorance, then it will be wrong
 bhashaa uskaa anugaman na karegi or yon us vyakaran ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karne par bhi bhashaa ko koi galat na kah degaa
 a grammar of Sanskrit also rules the term "punkshu" with "punsu"; But he was left there
 kabhi kisi ne "punkshu" nahin likhaa bolaa
 Panini described the word "sage" as monk; Like "labor" "rest"
 parantu sanskrit sahitya main "vishram" chalata rahaa; chal rahaa he or chalata rahegaa
 Language has a tendency
 jab panini hi bhashaa ke pravaah ko na roak sake, to dusron kii ginati hi kya
 Grammar and linguistics are two terms; The scope of the two is different; But both are partners of each other
 vyakaran padprayog maatr par vichaar karata he; jab ki bhashavigyaan "pad" ke mul rup kii utpatti vyutpatti yaa vikaas kii paddati batalaata he
 The grammar will state that the form of "no" becomes "a" or "an"
 vyanjanadi shabdon main "a" or swaradi main "an" hota he - "adwitiya", "anupam"
 When there is dominance in prohibition, then there is no concourse - "brahmin naasti", "asya upma nasti"
 anyatra "abrahmana: vedadhyayane mandadaraa: santi" or "anupaman kashmirsaundarya drushtam" aadi main samaas hoga; kyonki nishedh vidheyatmak nahin he
 The grammar will tell the compound and where the compound will be fine, not where; All this is the work of Batalana "sahitya Shastra"
 "na" se vyanjan udhakar "a" rah jaataa he or varnatya se "an" ho jaataa he
 This "an" has been recited by the Hindi for "samas" in the form of "an" - "anhoni", "unknown" etc
 "na" ke ye vividh rup vyakaran bana nahin detaa; bane banaae roopon kaa vah "anvakhyaan" bhar karata he
 It is the work of linguistics to shed light on these forms of "no"
 vyakaran batalaayegaa ki kisi dhaatu se "na" bhavvaachak pratyay karke usamen hindi kii sangyavibhakti "aa" laga dene se bhavvaachak sangyaayen ban jaati hai-aana, janaa, uthanaa, baithna aadi
 But the function of grammar is not to explain the evolution of metals like come, go, rise, sit etc
 yah kaam bhashavigyaan kaa he
 In Sanskrit such nouns are used in the eunuch class - Adhinavam, Gamanam, Utthanam, Upavashanam etc
 parantu hindi main puprayog hota he-"aapkaa aana kab hua?" hindi ne puprayog kyon kiya, yah vyakaran na batayega
 He will fill in the rhyme - "such nouns hold a masculine form" Enough! It is linguistic work to explain why this happened! jab koi bhashaa kisi duusari bhashaa se koi shabd leti he, to use apane shashan main chalaati he - apane vyakaran ke anusaar uski gati niyantrit karti he
 The word "dhoti" in Hindi went to English, so there it had to introduce English grammar
 prayog hota he angreji main - "brinrag avar dhotij"
 The plural of "dhoti" will not work there
 "bring avar dhotiyaan" prayog vahaan galat samajha jayega
 Similarly, the Hindi word "foot" was taken by Hindi and kept under his rule
 angreji main "foot" kaa bahuvachan "feet" hota he; par hindi main angreji vyakaran na chalegaa
 Used - "four feet height", "four feet height" is incorrect
 "oonchaai" bhi galat he; "unchaai" shuddh he
 Is the "height"; Not "low altitude"
 sanskrit main ikarant shabdon ke dwivachan ikarant ho jate hai- "kavi samagtau"; hindi main aisa na hoga
 Will be called "two poets came"
 isi tarah sanskrit main "rajdpanti samagtau"
 "rajdampati" everywhere in Hindi
 parkeey shabdon ko aatmsaat karne kii yah bhi ek prakriya he ki anamel rup ko kaat chhantakar apane mail kaa bana lenaa
 The Hindi word "ganga Ji" went to English; By creating "ganzies"
 angreji "lenturn" shabd hindi ne liya; par "laalaten" banaakar or "hospital" ko "aspataal" banaakar
 "hospital" is also incorrect in Hindi
 "hospital" or "doctor" jaise rup hindi ko grahya nahin
 The grammar of Hindi will regulate that there is no pronunciation in Hindi, which is manifested by placing the reverse tone on the vowel
 yahan "master" kii hi tarah doctor" chalata he
 Yes, if you want to write English language in Nagari script then it will work in reverse - The Doctor Was Fullish "
 isi tarah nagari main farsi jaisi bhashaa likhni ho to "bazaar", "jarurat" aadi rup rahenge; par hindi main neeche bindi na rahegi - "jaruri chizon ke liye bazaar he
 "even if you write Urdu lions, you will get down
 shabdon kaa yah rupanirdhaaran vyakaran ke varna prakaran se hoga

 Mahatma Gandhi's influence became unavoidable for him during the independence movement

 Amma does not go far for enjoyment and nectar even for paternity, because: Truth is as far away as it is near, tad duré, tadu endike: The poet Manas says - Give me the power to / i enjoy i can also share the portions / others

 a decade later, he stepped out of the boundaries of home and family into the realm of spirituality
 tab tak yah kshetra unke liye aparichit jaisaa tha
 He got his initial knowledge of theosophy from his maternal uncle
 hindu shastron kaa sahaj gyaan unhen pehle se hi tha
 Therefore, the combined form of Theosophy and Hindu Manisha came in the form of his ideas in writing
 ammaa ke do darjan se adhik kavy-sankalan, kai gadhy-sankalan or anuwaad prakashit hue hai
 He started writing poems from a young age

 The great work of n ॰ Narayana Menon called Kannuniratrulli Ashrubindu had a profound effect on Amma and helped her become a poetess
 mahakavi ve narayan menon unke mamaa en narayan menon ke samakaleen, maardarshak or ghanishtha mitra the
 Scholars like 'kuttikrishna Marar' and 'mukund Das' also used to come to his house
 ghar main saahitiyik charchaa kaa vaataavaran rahata tha
 She grew up in this environment
 sakshi or aswadika ke rup main ve vahaan upasthit rahati thim
 Mahakavi v Narayana Menon was one of the great poets in Malayalam literature who presented the mental sense of the human as a form of fantasy, which translated the Balmiki Ramayana in 1909
 1910 main "badhirvilapam" naamak vilaapkavy likhaa
 After that he wrote many dramatic expressions - Ganapathi, Bandhanasthanaay Anirudhan, Oru Kattu, Shishyunum Makanum, Magdalan Mari Yama, Achhukanum Makanum Kochusita etc
 san 1924 ke baad rachit sahityamanjariyon main hi vallattol ke deshbhakti se otprot ve kavyasuman khile the jinhone unako rashtrakavi ke pad par asin kiya

 Part of his poetic courtesy can be seen in Amma's compositions
 ammaa kahati hai ki unke mamaa en narayan menon ke paas vishwa sahitya kii kai vishisht kritiyaan thim
 He was related to those works since childhood
 mahakavi rabindranath tagore krit 'di gardenar' or 'victor hugo krit 'las missrbalas' jaisi shreshth kritiyon se ve prabhavit hui thim, jo aage chalakar unki rachanaatmakataa ko dhar dene main sahaayak siddh hua
 Thus Amma has been highly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore, Victor Hugo, N
 Narayana Menon and V
 Narayan Menon in her literary life
 ammaa ne swatantraaa ke pehle kaa bharat bhi dekha or uske baad kaa bhi
 As a result, Amma, known as Vatsalya, Mamta, a poetess of the gentle spirit of humanity, tried to give a vision of the existential havoc, rudan within the then society, to be tested and compassionate, to overcome the darkness
 tees ke dashak kii unki kavitaaon main deshbhakti, gandhi kaa prabhaav or swatantraaa kii chaah spasht parilakshith hoti he
 During the Indian freedom struggle, he wore khaddar and spun spinning in his private life
 san 1929-39 ke bich likhi unki kavitaaon main deshbhakti or swatantraaa kii chaah spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Amma says that Gandhi was like a member of the Nalpat family
 unka agochar saannnidhya unhen unke har kriya-kalap ko prabhavit karata rahaa
 Then he was inspired to stay away from the pompousness
 ve narayan mendemma ke preranastrot Inspirators of Victor Hugoamma rabindranath tagoremma ke preranastrot Inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi apni aatmakathaatmak tippaniyon ke kram main ammaa ne sweekaar kiya he, ki kavy rachana ke kshetra main unke pati ve em nair ne unhen protsaahit kiya
