 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 If the gametes are of the same shape, then it is called as homozygous
 samayugmakon ke sanyog ko sanyugman kehete hai
 The zygote either gives birth directly to the plant or becomes intermittent zygote called zygospore
 is prakaar ke langik janan ko 'samayugmi' kehete hai
 The process of sexual reproduction has two main stages - meiosis and fertilization
 langik janan kii utpatti kaise hui, yah ek paheli he
 Several explanations have been presented about why sexual reproduction evolved from asexual reproduction
 kai protists yon punarutpaadan, bahukoshikeey paudhon, jaanwaron, or kavak ke rup main karte hai
 In the eukaryotic fossil record, sexual reproduction first appeared in Proterozoic Eon 1
2 billion years ago
 sabhi yon punarutpaadan eukeriotic jeev sambhawatah ek ekal cell vaale aam purvaj se nikalate hai
 It is possible that the development of sex was an integral part of the development of the first eukaryotic cell
 aisi kuch prajatiyaan hai jo duusari baar is feechar ko kho chuki hai, jaise ki badeloidia or kuch partnocarpec paudhon
 In more developed plants, sexual reproduction occurs by fruits and seeds
 unke phulon main nar gamit or maadaa yugmak hote hai, jinke sayujya se yugmaj banate hai
 These develop into embryos inside the seed, sprouting and giving rise to new plants
 gamit bahut sookshm or eckoshikeey hote hai
 Sexual reproduction requires two different parents
 kabhi-kabhi ek hi prakaar ke do gamit milakar janan karte hai
 The meeting of such union is called
 do vibhinn gamiton ke milane ko nishechan kehete hai
 Algae and fungi resemble germination in lower grade plants and fertilization in higher grade plants
 jin paudhon ke gamit main nar or maadaa kaa vibhed nahin hota unhen samayugmak kehete hai or aise paudhon ko samayugmi 
 What makes male and female together in fertilization is the spermatozoa, the Assam gametes of the gametes and the plant is called asaugamia or miscellaneous flowers
 janan kii uparyukt vidhiyon ke atirikt kuch anya vidhiyon, jaise ajeevanujanan, apyugmajanan or asechan janan se bhi janan hota he
 There are many methods of sexual reproduction in animals, the main methods are- saamaanya langik janan main do janyu koshikaaye milakar ek yugmaj banaati hai
 Two animals have their origin in the parents of two different sexes
 nar janyu ko shukranu or stri janyu ko dimb yaa andanu kehete hai
 These Januas originate in special ingredients, ie, the Janadas
 nar janad ko vrushan or stri janad ko andashay kehete hai
 The union of the aforementioned two lives is called impregnation

 The first order is the multiplication stage, the second order is the growth phase and the third order is the mature state
 bhruneey apithilium kii sabhi koshikaaye nirmaan main sakasham hoti hai, par kuch hi usamen bhaag leti hai
 These cells are divided into geometrical proportions by necrosis
 vibhaajan se bani koshikaon ko shukranu-koshik-jan kehete hai
 Sperm-cell-masses are very microscopic
 inke andar poshak padaarth ekatrit hene se ye badhane lagate hai
 Such unclassified cells are called primary sperm cells
 ye phir paripakv avasthaa main pravesh karti hai
 Here primary sperm cells divide twice
 pratham vibhaajan ardhasuthran yaa hraas vibhaajan kaa he
 Prior to this division, the number of chromosomes present in the nucleus of the primary sperm cell is doubled, but the parental chromosomes at the time of meiosis are arranged in pairs by intercalation
 antargranthan main koi do chromosomi jode nahin banaate varan aise hi chromosome jode banaate hai jo samadharmi yaa saman shakti or rachana ke hote hai
 Thus the number of ancestral chromosomes in the meiosis becomes haploid
 koshikaaye ab dwitiya shukranukoshika ho jaati hai
 The second spermatocyte is once again divided into what is called mitosis
 isse purvashukranu banate hai, jo dhire dhire roopantarit hokar shukranu ban jate hai
 a typical sperm has three parts - the head, middle section or cervix and tail

 Eggs are produced from the cells of the ovaries
 andey kii bhi gunan avasthaa, vruddhi avasthaa or paripakv avasthaa hoti he
 Egg multiplication is formed by multiplication of some of the producing cells of the ovary
 koshikajanon main andpit ekatra hokar badhate hai or badhkar praathmik dimbkoshika banate hai
 They again degenerate and divide into two separate cells
 inamen ek bahut choti or duusari badi hoti he
 The smaller one is called the first polar body and the larger one is called the second ovary
 dwitiya dimbkoshika kaa sutaran vibhaajan hoti he
 Here too, one is small and the other is big
 badi ko paripakv yaa praudh anda or choti ko dwitiya dhruviya pind kehete hai
 The primary polar bodies are also threaded to get polarity
 dhruviya rachanaayen janan ke kaam ke liye bekaar hoti hai
 The semicircular or degenerate division is necessary because the number of zygotes formed by the combination of such genera is the same as the number of ancestral formulas required for that caste, otherwise the ancestral traits may be likely to change in the offspring
 paitruk sutron kii sankhya nishchit rakhane ke liye yugmaj jagak ke samay unka hraas vibhaajan aavashyak he

 Their conjugation is by intercourse between male and female
 sambhog ke samay dimb or shukranu nikat to aa jate hai, par shukr kaa dimb ke saath milakar ek ho janaa, arthath dimb kaa nishechan kai baton par nirbhar karata he
 Eggs are not impregnated if conditions are not favorable
 sansechan ke liye nimnlikhit paristhitiyaan aavashyak hai : The number of eggs is very small in interbreeding animals and one or a few offspring are produced at a time, but in those animals which have external impregnation, the number of eggs is more and the sperm count is more than the eggs
 Even more
 jab andon or shukranuon kaa sanyog jal main hota he, yugmajon ke liye anek baadhaayen rahati hai, jaise jal kaa taap, uski amlata yaa kshariyata, ; jal kii dhara kii gati, aasapaas ke anya jaleey praaniyon kii upasthiti ityadi
 Thus, nature maintains a large number of eggs and sperm to maintain a series of species, as many of the eggs and sperm from these majority of eggs and sperm die in an uncorrected state on account of any of the above reasons
 sansechan ke liye ek dimb ko ek hi shukranu kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The normal sperm count in ejaculated semen during one-time sexual intercourse has been estimated at 22,60,00,000
 inamen keval ek hi shukranu dimb ko sansechit karne kaa kaam karata he
 Only one egg in each ovulation originates from the ovum
 jyon hi koi kriyasheel shukranu apane hi spishij ke praani ke dimb ke sampark main aata he tyon hi vah usamen pravesh kar jaataa he
 The head of the sperm penetrates inside the egg, but its tail is broken and remains outside
 dimb main shukr pravesh kar uske andar anek ghatnaon ko uttejit karata he
 First, he blocks the entry of another sperm into the egg
 yah kaam is prakaar hota he : a type of chemical secretion is released from the outer layer of the impregnated egg, which does not attract the other sperm to the egg, or it forms a jelly-like membrane around the outside of the egg, which prevents sperm from entering
 Or a very small hole in the egg surrounded by impermeable wall, the micropyle closes as a sperm enters
 dimb main pravisht karne par shukranu nirdhaarit path se cendrak kii ore agrasar hote hue dimb ke purvakendrak se miltaa he or shukranu tathaa dimb donon hi ke purvakendrak ghulmilakar chromosome banaate hai, jo koshika dravya main swatantra pade rahete hai
 The egg now becomes a zygote
 dimb kaa centrosonom lupt ho jaataa he, par shukranu kaa centrosom do bhaagon main bant jaataa he or ek gatisheel tarku kaa nirmaan karata he
 Chromosomes take their place around the ovary of this larynx, and the embryo begins to form and begin to divide and develop the accumulated ovum
 janyuon kaa sayujya kaise hota he, isapar vichaar karne se pataa lagata he ki adhikansh dashaon main to sanyog se hi nar janyu tairte-tairte maadaa janyu ke sampark main aa jaataa he, par kuch dashaon main shukranu sidhe nirdisht lakshya kii ore badhate hai
 The reason for this is because the sperm is attracted towards a particular chemical substance
 is rasinic dravya ko dimb utpann karata he
 This is called chemical traction
 par har dasha main rasinic karshan nahin hota
 It is believed that there is a polar difference between the male population and the female population, due to which they are attracted
 aakarshan kaa vaastavik kaaran kya he, yah nishchit rup se abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 During mating, the female is usually inactive and the male develops a variety of interlocking elements to embrace the female

 These secondary traits are helpful in combining male and female by affecting the sense organs
 kuch praaniyon main kuch aise bhi sahaayak avyav paae jate hai, jo santan kii raksha ke liye hote hai
 After impregnation in many beings, the responsibilities of the parents cease and the zygote develops without any care, in some creatures the children take care of themselves, but in some creatures the parents take great care to protect their offspring

 This theoretical achievement of Trotsky in the first decade of the twentieth century amid the ongoing debate among Marxists reinforced the logic of revolutionizing an industrially backward country like Russia
 lenin ke dehanth ke baad trotski ne stallin dwaara pravartit ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant kaa virodh kiya, lekin ve party ke bheetar hone vaale sangharsh main akele padate chale gayi

 His ideas have been labeled Trotskyism as an alternative to Soviet-style communism
 trotski kaa asli naam lev davidovich bronstin tha

 unke jivan ko teen bhaagon main baant kar dekha ja saktaa he
 The first part is when, like an independent sign of Russian Marxism, he came close to Lenin while participating in the revolutionary movement and then refused to support him
 doosraa hissaa 1917 se shuru ho kar 1923 tak chalaa jab unhone lenin ke saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar soviet kranti ko agrgati pradaan kii
 After this, the third phase of his life began when he waged a campaign against Stalinism to defend the benefits of the revolution
