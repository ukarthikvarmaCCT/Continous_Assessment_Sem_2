 Aitareya Upanishad is a Shukla Rigvedic Upanishad

 This Upanishad is Brahmavidyapradhan

 In its upbringing, he decides for salvation and after annihilating karma and unproven knowledge, he only gives knowledge as his only means
 phir gyaanake adhikaar kaa nirnay kiya he or bade samaaroh ke saath karmkandi ke adhikaar kaa niraakaran karte hue sanyasi ko hi uskaa adhikari tehraaya he
 There they say that 'grihasthashram' is the name of the accession of its home special and it can only happen while the desires are there and there is a complete lack of desires in the knowledgeable
 isliye yadi kisiprakaar chittashuddhi ho jane se kisi ko grihasthashram main hi gyaan ho jaay to bhi kamnashunya ho jane se apane grihavishesh ke parigrah kaa abhaav ho jane ke kaaran use swatah hi bhikshukatv kii prapti ho jaaygi

 Sruti are only for the ignorant, no such method can be done for Bodhwan

 There are three chapters in this Upanishad
 unamem se pehle adhyay main teen khand hai tathaa duusare or tisare adhyyonmen keval ek-ek khand hai
 In the first chapter, it is told that there was only one soul at the beginning of creation, there was nothing else for it, it was a testament to folklore and by mere effort, it created the three worlds of Amba, Marichi and Die
 inhen rachakar us paramatmane unke liye lokapaloki rachana karneka vichaar kiya or jalse hi ek purush kii rachnaakar use avyavyukt kiya
 It was with the resolve of God that the great male sense ball and the god of senses were born
 jab ve indriyaadhishthata devtaa is mahasamudramen aaye to paramatmane unhen bhukh-pyaas se yukt kar diya
 Then he prayed that any such volume should be provided in which we can feed and eat
 paramatma ne unke liye gauka sharir prastut kiya, kintu unhone ‘yah hamaare liye paryaapt nahin hai ‘aisa kahkar use asweekaar kar diya
 The body of the horse was brought thereafter but that too was rejected
 ant main paramatma ne unke liye manushya kaa sharir laayaa
 Seeing him, all the gods approved him in one voice, and they all were placed in the form of speech, soul, eye, etc
 in his various components by the command of God

 is prakaar yah sari sristi ho janaper paramatma ne vichaar kiya ki ab mujhe bhi isamen pravesh karnaa chaiye; kyonki mere bina yah sara prapanch akinchitkar hi he
 So he disintegrated the statue of the man and entered it by him
 is prakaar jeevabhavako praapt honaper uskaa bhutonke saath tadatmya ho jaataa hai
 When the Gurukripa realizes that he is interviewed in his all-pervasive pure form, he becomes 'indra' - 'indra' because of seeing him in an unconformed manner
 is prakaar ikshan se lekar paramatma ke praveshparint jo sristikram batalaaya gaya he, ise hi vidyaranyaswami ne ishwar sristi kaha he
 The world is enlightened: is aakhyayika main bahut-si vicitra baaten dekhi jaati hai
 In this way, nothing in Maya is ridiculous; However, Acharya's statement is that this is only economism
 iskaa abhipraay aatmbodh karaane main he
 It is said only to make the spirit unique
 Because the whole world is self-centered because of the soul's determination
 dwitiya aadhyatm ke armbh main isi prakaar upkram kar bhagwaan bhashyakaarane aatmatatvaka bada sundar or yuktiyukt vivechan kiya he
 This chapter describes the three stages of life, which is called 'awasath' in the first chapter, for the perfection of enlightened self for enlightenment
 jivake teen janm maane gayi hai- According to this sruti, the soul and the son are the impenetration of the father and the son; That is why the rebirth of the father has also been described as the third birth of the son
 vamdev rishi ne garbh main rahete hue hi apane bahut-se janmon kaa anubhav batalaaya tha or yah kaha jaataa tha ki main lohamay durgon ke samaan saikadon sharir main bandi rah chukaa hoon; kintu ab atmagyaan ho jane se main shyen pakshi ke samaan unka bhedan kar baahar nikal aayaa hoon
 Due to such knowledge, Vamdev Sage attained the eternal immortal status of dehpat
 atah aatma ko bhoot evam indriya aadi anatmaprapanchase sarvatha asang anubhav karnaa hi amartv-praptika ekmaatr saadhan he
 Thus, in the second chapter, the soul has been described as the only source of the supreme knowledge in the third chapter
 vahaan batalaaya he ki hriday man, sangyaan, aagyaan, vigyaan, medha, drushti, dhrut, mati, manisha, juti, smriti, sankalp, kratu, asu kaam evam vash-ye sab pragyan ke hi naam hai
 This knowledge is Brahma, Indra, Prajapati, all the Gods, the Westerners, and the Uvijjas, Svedaj Andajas and Jarayus, etc
 are all living things
 yahi hathi, ghode, manushya tathaa sampoorn sthavar jangam jagat he
 In this way, the whole world is situated in knowledge, it is inspired by knowledge and itself is also in the form of knowledge, and knowledge is the Brahman
 jo is prakaar jaanata he vah is lok se utkraman kar us paramadham main pahunch samast kaamanaayon ko praapt kar amar ho jaataa he

 Hemachandracharya wrote in his poetry that Sattak is monolithic
 praayah sattakon kaa naam unki nayikaon ke naam par diya gaya he
 This important word in Vedic literature is used in the Rigveda Samhita to mean song or mantra
 'gai' dhaatu se nishpann hone ke kaaran geet hi iskaa vyutpattilabhya tathaa pracheenatam arth prathit hota he
 Despite the achievement of the word Gath, the use of the word Akarant is popular

 Gathani is used for the person who leads a song
 rujugath shuddh rup se mantron ke gayan karanevaale ke liye tathaa gathin keval gayak ke arth main vyavahrut kiya gaya he 
 Although its aforesaid general meaning is largely intended, it has a more specific meaning in this mantra of the Rigveda, because here it is classified with Narashansi and Rabi: yah sahavargeekaran ruk samhita ke baad anya vaidic granthon main bhi bahush: uplabdh hota he 11

 bhashyakaar sayan ne in teenon shabdon ko atharvaveda ke katipay mantron ke saath samikrut kiya he
 20th episode of Atharvaveda, 12th mantra saga of 127th Sukta; 1-3 mantras of the same Sukta, Narasanshi and 4-6 mantras are also mentioned
 isi sameekaran ko doctor oldenberg rugveda kii drushti main doshapurn maanate hai, parantu doctor bluemfield kii drushti main yah sameekaran ruk samhita main sweekrut kiya gaya he
 The practice of the Brahmin Samhita sheds considerable light on the character and nature of the saga
 aitarey brahman kii drushti main mantron ke vividh prakaar main gaatha maanav se sambandh rakhti he, jabaki rich dev se sambandh rakhata he
 That is, the saga is a different and different mantra from being human and Ritch being divine
 is tathy kii pushti shun:shape aakhyaan ke liye prayukt shatgatham shabd se paryaaptaroopen hoti he, kyonki shun:shape ajigart rishi kaa putr hone se maanav tha jisaki katha rugveda ke anek sookhton main di gai he
 The number of mantras of these suktas is around one hundred, so in the eyes of Aitareya Brahmin, the word saga is clearly used for the mantra signifying human and human subjects
 aitarey aaranyak gaatha ko rich tathaa kumbya se bhinn tathaa pruthak mantra kaa ek prakaar maanata he jisase gaatha ke padhyabaddh hone kaa paryaapt sanket miltaa he
 From the point of view of the subject of the Varna, though religious due to the expression of the subjects related to religion, the ritual literature of the Vedas is said to be unholy compared to the Rach Yajusha and the Saman, meaning that these spells are not considered in this era
 maitrayani samhita kaa kathan he ki vivaah ke samay gaatha anand pradaan karti he or grihyasutron main anek gaathaayen di gai hai jinhen vivaah ke shubh avasar par veena par gaaya jaataa tha
 In the context of Aitareya Brahmana's Aandra Mahabhisheka, many ancient gems have been cited in praise of famous kings who are given huge sacrifices in the Yajna and anointed by specific priests, which are also available in the story of the Puranas
 shatapath brahman main bhi aisi daanparak gaathaayen surakshit hai
 In the previous era, saga and Narasanshi rhyme often came to be considered synonymous, but basically there is a separation between the two
 gaatha gey mantron kaa saamaanya abhidhaan he jiske antargat narashansi kaa antarbhaav maananaa sarvatha nyaayay he
 This fact is confirmed by the commentary of Aitareya Aranyak
 sayan ne yahan praat: praatar anrutan te vadanti kii gaatha kaa udhaaharan diya he jo spashtat: narashansi nahin hai
 The language of the saga is different from the language of Vedic mantras
 isamen veda ke visham vaiyaakaran roopon kaa sarvatha abhaav he tathaa padon kaa sarleekaran hi sfoottatya abhivyakt hota he
 It is clear from certain examples of the saga: yah mantra prasiddh kutaap sookhton ke antargat aayaa he, parantu isaki style tathaa varshya vishay kaa prakaar ise gaatha siddh kar rahe hai
 In the saga associated with Bharata, son of King Dushyant in Aitareya Brahmin: yahan ye shloke naam se abhihit hone par bhi pracheen gaatha main hai jo parampara se praapt hoti puraanon tak chali aati he
 How many such gathas have been cited in Brahmin texts
 jain dharm tathaa buddha dharm main bhi mahavir tathaa gautam buddha ke upadeshon kaa nishkarsh upasthit karanevaale padya gaatha naam se vikhyath he
 Jain stories are in Ardhamagadhi and Buddhist stories in Pali language

 About 90 percent of the world's leather is made from the skins of large animals, such as bovine animals, and sheep and goats, but horse, boar, kangaroo, reindeer, reptile, sea horse, and seaweed skins are also used as a modus operandi

 The amount of elastin has an effect on both the tension and elasticity of the leather
 khaal main vasakoshikaon kaa bhi apana pruthak mahatv he
 For example, if a large group of them is radiated into collagen fibers in a skin, its leather will certainly become soft and spongy; The reason is that in the early work of pre-tanning, the removal of adipocyte will create numerous small spaces, which will make the skin supple

 40 years ago, where there were only many companies in the supercomputers market, now only big names like Cray, Dell, HP, IBM, NEC, SGI, HP, Sun are left in this market

 iske peeche america kii apane prabhutv barkaraar rakhane kii manshaa maani ja rahi thi, kyonki vah ek aisa daur tha, jab bharat or china main takneekee kranti kii shuruyaat ho chuki thi
 In such a situation, America did not want any other power in the world to stand against it in terms of technology
 chunki super computer ke upyog se rocket prakshepan, parmaanu visphot ke samay gananaaon main aasaani ho jaati he, isliye bhi america ke man main bhay tha ki kahin iske dwaara bharat apane nabhikeey urja prasar kaarykram ko ek nayaa rup na de de
 But Indian scientists made their capabilities realized by making C-deck param-8000 computers
 1988 main rus ne bharat ko super computer dene kii baat kahi thi
 But Russia's proposal was rejected as the hardware was not correct
 bharat ne super computer banane ke baad param 8000 germany, euke or rus ko diya
 India is also a figure in the field of supercomputers
 duniya ke awwal 500 super computaron kii nai top ten list main uskaa super computer chauthe sthaan par aayaa he
 The supercomputer 'HP-3000-BL-460-C', built by the Tata Company's Pune-based unit - 'computational Research Laboratories', is ranked just behind supercomputers in the US and Germany with a speed of 117
9 teraflops
 haalanki hamaara yah pehla super computer nahin he
 Much earlier in 1998, scientists from C-DAC, Pune, created the 'param-1 xxrep 4 0 ' supercomputers and claimed that the supercomputer was 50 times faster than the current American supercomputers at the time
 lekin uske baad super computing ko lekar bharat main waisi utsukata nahin dikhaai di, jaisi anya viksit mulkon main is dauraan rahi he
 But now it seems that India does not want to be backward in this race, which is the result of this Tata supercomputer

 arabi darshan kaa vikaas chaar manjilon se hokar gujara he: Translations and interpretations of Greek texts by Sami and Muslims, this is the era of translations; buddhiparak hetuvaadi yug; Religious rationalist era; shuddh darshanik yug When the Arabs had control over the material, they had the opportunity to study the Greek texts which had been translated into Sami or Arabic by the Samaritans
 prasiddh sami tikaakar nimnilikhit hai: Probes who have been considered the first commentators

 Sergius, a resident of Racine, who translated Greek texts related to religion, ethics, macro-materials science, medicine and philosophy
 edisa ke nivasee yakob, yah muslim shashan ke pashchaat bhi unani dharmik tathaa darshanik granthon kaa anuwaad karne main vyast rahe
 Especially during the rule of Mansoor, Muslims also started translating the Unani scriptures in Arabic language, mainly related to material science and logic or medicine

 All these people were busy translating scientific and philosophical texts
 10ve shatabdi main bhi unani granthon ke anuwaad kaa kaam gatisheel rahaa
 Famous translators of this time are Abu Bishr Matta, Abu Zakariya Yahia Ibne Alagantiqi, Abu Ali Isa ibne Isaac ibne Jura, Abulkhair Al Hasan ibnul Khanmar etc
 sankshep main, musalamaanon ne greek shastron kaa sami athwa arabi bhashaa main adhyayan kiya athwa swayan in granthon kaa arabi main anuwaad kiya
 Greek ideology and philosophical vision was developed by the Samaritans from Alexandria and Antioch to the east in Edisa, Nisibis, Harran and Gandeshpur and when the Muslims reached there by conquest, they took whatever Greek philosophy and scripture was available and gradually Philosophical thinking started with the impact of the problems confronting
 islam main sabase pratham vichaarvimarsh parmaarthik svachhndatha kaa tha
 In Basra, which was then a center of learning and erudition, one day Imam Hasan Basri, the great scholar of that era, was teaching in a mosque when someone asked him whether the person, who committed a crime, is a Muslim or an atheist
 
 imam hasan basri koi uttar dene ko hi the ki unka ek shishy vaasil bin ata bol uthaa ki aisa vyakti na muslim he or na islam ke viruddh he
 Saying this, he went to another part of the mosque and began to explain his idea, on which the Guru told the people that the disciple had 'abandoned us'
 is vaakya par is vichaarshakha kii sthapana hui
 Since the Umraiya rulers were committing gross sins and told themselves innocent by saying that we do nothing, God insures everything, this raised the question of freedom in Islam very quickly
 hetuvaadiyon ne is prashn tathaa isi prashn kii sannikat shakhaon kaa vishesh anusandhan kiya
 Abul Hazail died in the middle of the ninth century
 inhone ek ore manushya ko svachhndatha pradaan kii ore duusari ore khuda ko bhi sarvashakti sampann siddh kiya
 Man's willingness is proved by the fact that all religions say some legalization, which is not possible without freedom
 duusari daleel he ki prayek dharm swarg ko prapya tathaa narak ko tjajya bataate hai jisase pramanit he ki munashya ko swechha praapt he
 The third argument is that the freedom of man does not in any way inhibit the omnipotence and omniscience of God
 khuda or uske gunon main visheshan-visheshya-bhav nahin he balki samarupatv he
 For example, God is omniscient; So this means that he is knowledgeable
 gyaan athwa shakti athwa anya gun usase bhinn nahin hai
 He is omniscient, but in comparison to God, it cannot be related to many qualities like virtue and virtue, because God is omnipresent and no object, attribute or adjective is excluded from it
 iske atirikt daivi gunon kaa saadhaaran arth nahin liya ja saktaa tathaa unhen manushyaropit nahin kah sakate
 Therefore, godliness is not against human freedom, godliness is just a sign for creation
 iskaa kinchit yah arth nahin he ki sansar athwa manushya sarvash: ishwaradheen he
 Manly freedom is necessary for character building, but Godly mandate towards lifespan is undoubtedly useful
 al najzaam abul huzail ke shishy the, empidacliz tathaa anaksagores kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit
 According to their opinion, no god can do inauspicious actions
 vah vahi karata he jo uske das tathaa bhakton ke liye atyant shubh he
 In relation to God, it is necessary to take the word 'will' in a special sense
 is sambandh main is shabd se koi kami athwa aavashyaktaa pradarshit nahin hoti, balki 'ichha' khuda ke sarvakrtrutv kaa hi ek paryaay he
 The process of creation has completely ended in the past and now other things, trees and animals or humans etc
 continue to be produced
 najzaam drishy anu kii satta na maanakar drishy padaarthon ko ek aprakritik gunsamooh khyaal karte hai
 All matter is not geomagnetic due to its divine properties, but inattention is the main subject
 zaahiz ke kathananusaar yadhyapi vishay prakrutisheel he tathaapi ishwariya prabhaav se koi bhi viheen nahin he
 Muammar says that God is virtuous due to being in power
 usko niraakaar samajhnaa hi uchit he
 By considering him as a virtue, the objection of opposite religiosity comes because even the opposite qualities cannot be considered to be excluded from him in any way
 naveen shatabdi main buddhiparak hetuvaadiyon ke viruddh kai vichaardhaaraen utpann huin
 There is an unhealthy practice among them, which is governed by al-ashri, whose ideology was gradually understood in all Islamic countries
 inhone mandabuddhi satyadharmanuayiyon kii saakaar upasna kaa virdohi hote hue bhi ek ore to khuda ko sampurna aishwarya pradaan kiya or duusari ore upasna kii svachhndatha sthapit kii
 According to his statement, nature has no automatic power without the influence of God
 saamanyat: manushya bhi sarvatha khuda par hi ashrith he
 But despite this, it is completely free
 dharmagyaan kaa mul vishay khuda chunki paroksh he at: purusharth kii prapti ke liye quran athwa koi anya ishwariya pratyadesh manushya jati ke liye anivaary he
 Abu Yakub bin Isaac Alakindi has been considered the best Arab philosopher by being Arab
 ye darshanik hone ke atirikt atyant suyogy vyakti or anyaanya kalaon main bhi siddhhast the
 Greek philosophers are extremely famous as commentators of important texts
 inhone yaa to swayan arabi bhashaa main unani granthon ke anuwaad kiye hai athwa apni adhyakshata main or logon se anuwaad karaae hai, phir inhen swayan sanshodhit kiya he
 Aristotle's Arabic translation was prepared under his chairmanship
 kindi ne anya dharmon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha or is adhyayan ke anusaar unka vishwaas tha ki sab dharm ek parmaarthik satta ko sweekaar karte hai jo sristi kaa mul kaaran he or sab dharmagyaataaon ne usee ko poojya tathaa mananeey bataaya he
 Being the creator, the influence of Allah is prevalent in the world, but his influence and light reaches the world from the real degeneration and the effect of the first emergence arises on the primordial origin and its next position
 pratham udbhav buddhi he or prakruti usee ke anusaar niyukt he
 Allah and nature are appointed accordingly
 allaah tathaa prakruti ke madhya main vishwatma he jisase jeevatma nirgat hua he
 Kindi is probably the first philosopher in the world to say that stimulation and anguish are fancied according to each other's evidence
 is siddhant kaa pravartan karne ke kaaran cafadan kindi kii gananaa vishwa ke sarvottam baarah darshanikon main karata he
 Farabi did a special study of Aristotle and that is why people in Asia remember him as Guru number two
 faraabi ke kathananusaar tarkshastra ke do mukhya bhaag hai
 In the first part, it is necessary to discuss the resolution and the occult positions
 dwitiya bhaag main anumaan tathaa pramaanon kaa varnan aata he
 Indrigrahm Uttamottam ordinary consciousness should also be counted under resolutions
 isi prakaar swabhaavajnya bhav bhi sankalpon ke antargat gini jaani chahie
 Similarly, the emotional expressions also come under the resolutions
 un sankalpon ke milan se nirnay kii utpatti hoti he jo sadasat hote hai
 For the origin of this member-decision-action, it is imperative that some sense or thought in the intellect is self-evident, whose forward truth is unnecessary
 is prakaar kii mul pratigyaayen ganit, aatmavidya tathaa nitishastra main vidyaman hai
 The principles which are specified in logic are also very clear in self-knowledge
 jo kuch vidyaman he vah yaa to sambhavit he athwa anyathaasiddh he
 Since the world is not axiomatic, we can indicate it by the name of God or Allah
 yah param satta jise allaah kehete hai, itaretar bhaavon se pukaare jane ke kaaran bhinn-bhinn naamon se anuchintit hota he
 Some of those names refer to his self-determination or some are his world-views
 parantu yah baat swayansiddh he ki uski parmaarthik satta in naamon tathaa oopaadhiyon dwaara agamya he
 According to Ibne Maskev's statement, Jeevatma is a body substance which is aware of its power and knowledge
 at: jeevatma kaa gyaan tathaa atmik udyog prachhann sharir kii seemaa se pare he
 This is the reason that his sense of cognition does not satisfy even the least in the subject of the world
 manushya apane antarjaat gyaan ke dwaara adharm se bachataa hua hit kii ore protsaahit he
 There are two types of interests: general and special
 saamaanya hit sabake liye purusharth he jo paramgyan ke dwaara praapt hota he
 Normally, man is loving, but this personal interest is an impediment to effort by being against mankind
 vaastavik sukh to manushyatv ke anusaar kaam karne main he or manushyatv ke adarsh kii prapti sansarg main hi sambhav he anyathaa nahin
 This conversation is also confirmed by Hajj and Namaz
 yahi pratibhaavna sab dharmon kaa aadesh he
 In Ibsina's opinion, the world is not inevitable to be probable
 avashyaprapya kii khoj ant main haq ko siddh karti he jisko yadhyapi bahut se naam tathaa visheshan die jate hai, parantu uski parmaarthik satta in sabake dwaara agamya he
 It is not that he is only nirguni
 use to sab gunon tathaa vishyon kaa aadhaar hone ke kaaran nirguni kahana hi upyukt he
 The divine origin arises from that divine power and it is the shelter of pluralism
 vishwatma jab apane kaaran kaa chintan karti he tab akashamandal chaitanya vikrut hota he jisase parichhann aatma kaa spashtikaran hokar anya sthool vikaar tathaa sharir viksit hote hai
 There is virtually no contact with body or soul
 sharir kii utpatti to chaar sookshm tatwon ke sammishran se he, parantu sharir kii utpatti chaturvidh gunon se nahin he, vah to vishwatma se viksit hone ke kaaran swat: paramamulak he
 From the beginning, the body is a self-proven subtle substance that is located in other bodies and is the reason for the sense of importance
 ibne al-hashim ke kathananusaar drishy padaarth kuch vishesh gunon kaa samooh he or in sab samuhik gunon ke hetu se hi koi padaarth apni vishesh sangya se pukaara jaataa he
 Now Brahman is directly a group of other moments by which such and such qualities of such matter are illuminated
 at: ek saadhaaran pratyaksh ke antargat anekanek gun pratyaksh prathit hote hai
 Each directly illuminates one of the qualities or expressions of the gross matter, which, after a few moments from memory, are called collective objects by collective promise
 algizaali ke samay tak muslim darshanikon dwaara darshanashastra kii vishesh unnati ho chuki thi parantu vah darshanavikas manushya kii hardik trishna kii tripti kar saktaa tha athwa nahin, yah koi bhi nahin samaj sakaa tha
 Gijali is the first person to give serious thought to this question
 inako kuch aisa prathit hua ki vah sab tatch-vichaar-dhara jo islam main kindi se aarambh hui or faraabi dwaara ibnecina tak pahaunchi thi or jiskaa aashray mukhyat: greek tatv-vichaar-dhara thi, sarvatha dharmik cheshtaaon or hardik rasikata ke viruddh he
 For them, on the one hand, there were heartfelt religious sentiments, which were fulfilled by the fulfillment of God, but on the other, there were intelligent ideas which are contrary to it
 yahi buddhiparak vichaar anya darshanon kaa mul aadhaar he, udaahranarth karankarya kaa vichaar
 Gazilli became skeptical for some time after experiencing himself in this resolution option
 vah kisi baat ko satya sweekaar karne ke liye raji na ho sake
 He analyzed all ideologies and other avenues of realization
 darshanikon ke vaakyaghaat ke liye unhone vishwa prasiddh granth 'darshanakhandan' likhaa jisamen sab darshanik ritiyon kaa khandan kiya
 At this stage, he tried a self-actualized real disorder
 ishwar, sansar, dharm, tatvagyan tathaa paramparaagat vichaardhaara sab asaty ho sakate hai, parantu sanshay par aashray hona aavashyak he
 Therefore, the skeptic is self-proven
 aham sanshayan karomi at: ahmasmi yah nishchay bhi sanshayatmak ho saktaa he
 Because doubt does not prove the true existence of the skeptic, only logical power is proven
 at: ahmatv kii prapti vichaarshakti se nahi, keval nishchayatmak shakti se is prakaar hoti he ki main karata hoon at: main hoon 
 After the accomplishment of importance, the discovery of the base of importance is essential
 yahan par kaaran-kaary-bhav kaa samajhnaa jaruri he
 From the scientific and philosophical point of view, the definition of reason has always been corrupt
 kaaran-kaary-bhav keval anukram ko nahin kah sakate
 The importance of reason is personally evident
 kisi kii siddhi main jo praytn kiya jaataa he uske antargat hi kaaran kaa vikaas hota he
 The cause of the soul can also be an all-encompassing supreme man with a lot of deterministic power, otherwise not
 is prakaar dharm siddh hota he or paramparaagat dharmik vichaardhaara tatvagyan kii sahaayak banati he
 After the weakening of the Umayya rule in Sama, Muslim rule was established in Spain by Abdurrahman
 vidyasevan tathaa sabhyataa kii drushti se spain ko 10veen shatabdi main vahi mahatv praapt tha jo isse pehle 9veen shatabdi main purvi deshon ko praapt tha
 There were many world-renowned philosophers in Spain, of whom only three — Ibnébaja, Ibnétufail, Ibnérubud — are described here
 ibnebaaja - inkaa vishesh darshanik udgaar aatma, jeevatma ke prakaran main he
 The power is divided into two parts
 pratham vah jo nishchal he, dwitiya vah jo gatisheel he
 What is dynamic is limited by being real
 parantu gatisheel hone ke liye ek niraakaar satta kii aavashyaktaa he
 This formless power is God, who is the driver for all flesh-bearers
 ibnetufail kii 'hayi ibne yahjaan' ek darshanik upaakhyaan he jiske dwaara yah siddh kiya gaya he ki dharm tathaa darshan paraspar sambhddha hai
 The ultimate knowledge which is obtained through rigorous philosophical study, the same supreme knowledge can be automatically acquired only through natural experience
 chunki prayek manushya agyani hone ke kaaran swayan swanubhav main shakt nahin he, at: dharm, jo saadhaaran janata ke liye shraddha tathaa paravishwaas par aadhaarit he, sarvada laabhadaayak rahegaa
 Philosophical study and metaphysical vision are inaccessible to ordinary people, so ordinary human being will be more religious than philosophical
 ibnerubd ne arestu kii vah vyakhya kii jo abhi tak koi na kar sakaa tha
 Hence, they are called 'spokespersons'
 unki drushti main sansar gatisheel he or krmanusaar jo hona shakya he vah hokar rahata he
 Half-physical powers are the cause of many consequences and the world can never be destroyed in general by being specific to the cause-function, but will continue to be isolated people
 saranshat: inke yahan teen naastik vichaar hai : pratham yah ki sansar anadi anant he, dwitiya yah ki kaaran-kaary-bhav se vishisht hone se sansar main daivi chamatkaar sambhav nahin, tritiy yah ki vyaktigat ke liye avkaash nahin

 Soils that are less fertile can be made fertile by adding fertilizer or chemical fertilizer, but the determination of ph is especially important
 saamanytah bijaropan ke dar ko 13-20 kilogram / prati hectares kii sifarish kii jaati he
 Sometimes a companion crop is planted so that problems of weeds and soil erosion are minimized, but it can be a cause of competition for light, water and nutrients
 adhikansh jalwaayu main alphalapha ko teen yaa chaar baar kaata jaataa he, parantu arizona or dakshini california main saal main 12 baar hoti he
 Ideally accounts for yields of about 8 tonnes per hectare but 20 tonnes per hectare are also obtained

 Yields increase on further harvesting, but the amount of nutrients decreases
 alphalapha ko keet aakarshak mana jaataa he, kyonki yah bahut kiton ko apni ore aakarshith karata he
 Some pests such as alfalfa mite, mahoo, armivorm and potato leaffinga can dramatically reduce alfalfa yield, especially during the second harvest when the weather is warm
 kabhi-kabhi rasayan niyantran kaa istemaal ise rokane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Alfalfa is also sensitive to root rot, including Phytopathora, Rhizotonia, and rotting of Texas roots
 jab alphalapha kaa istemaal sookhe ghans ke rup main kiya jaataa he, to use kaat kar gattha banaaya jaataa he
 Open-heap hay is still used in many areas, but pits can be easily transported, stored, and fed easily

 Alfalfa has a wide range of adaptation and can be grown from extremely cold northern plains to high mountain valleys, from high temperate agricultural areas to Mediterranean climates and warm deserts
 alphalapha ke beej ke utpaadan ke liye paraganon kii maujuudagi kii zarurat padati he jab alphalapha ke khet khilne kii sthiti main hote hai
 Pollination of alfalfa is somewhat difficult, as western bees, which are used as pollinators, are not suitable for this work; The bulb that receives the pollen of the alfalfa flower is often shaken and collides with the head of the pollen bee, which helps to transfer pollen to the bee that is seeking the bait
 lekin pashchimi madhumakhiyaan baar-baar sar par chot khaanaa pasand nahin karatin, ve is kriya ko phool ke bagal se paraag khinch kar parrast karti he
 In this way bees collect only pollen but do not collect pollination, thus they do not pollinate when they move to another flower
 As the aged bees fail to pollinate alfalfa, most pollinations are done by young bees who have not yet learned the magic of stealing from a flower without hitting a pollen-ingested egg
 jab pashchimi madhumakhiyon kaa istemaal alphalapha ko paraganit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he tab mackhiyon vaala khet ko mackhiyon ke oonche dar se bhar detaa he taaki yuva madhumakhiyon kii sankhya main adhikta aaye

 In simple words, the oil formula is defined on all polyfields
 The main formula is the following: pane + vertex = core + 2 or f + v = e + 2 or f + v - e = 2 YOU CAN EVEN PRACTICALY EXPERMENT THIS FORMULA ON EVERY POLYHEDRON
 NOW LET'S MOVE AHEAD & KNOW MORE ABOUT THE EULER'S FORMULA
 LETS KNOW ABOUT ITS HISTORY AS MENTIONED BELOW: -euler's formula was proven for the first time by Roger Cotes in 1714 in the form 
 It was Euler who published the equation in its current form in 1748, basing his proof on the infinite series of both sides being equal
 Neither of these men saw the geometrical interpretation of the formula: the view of complex numbers as points in the complex plane arose only some 50 years later
 Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today
 In his elementary algebra text book, Elements of Algebra, he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout
 This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function eix traces out the unit circle in the complex number plane as x ranges through the real numbers
 Here, x is the angle that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counter clockwise and in radians
 The original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function ez and of sin x and cos x for real numbers x
 In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all complex numbers z
 a point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number written incartesian coordinates
 Euler's formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates
 The polar form reduces the number of terms from two to one, which simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers
 Any complex number z = x + iy can be written as where φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is the argument of z—i
e
, the angle between the x axis and the vector z measured counterclockwise and in radians—which is defined up to addition of 2π
 Now, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler's formula to define the logarithm of a complex number
 To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm that and that both valid for any complex numbers a and b
 Therefore, one can write: for any z ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle z \ neq 0}
 Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that: and in fact this can be used as the definition for the complex logarithm
 The logarithm of a complex number is thus a multi-valued function, because φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is multi-valued
 Finally, the other exponential law which can be seen to hold for all integers k, together with Euler's formula, implies several trigonometric identities as well as de Moivre's formula
 Euler's formula provides a powerful connection between analysis and trigonometry, and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function: The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas: and solving for either cosine or sine
 These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments x
 For example, letting x = iy, we have: Complex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components
 One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials
 After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued
 For example: Another technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the real part of a more complex expression, and perform the manipulations on the complex expression
 For example: This formula is used for recursive generation of a sinusoid at intervals of x radians
 In differential equations, the function eix is often used to simplify derivations, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine
 Euler's identity is an easy consequence of Euler's formula
 In electrical engineering and other fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sine and cosine functions, and these are more conveniently expressed as the real part of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler's formula
 Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor
 In general, raising e to a positive integer exponent has a simple interpretation in terms of repeated multiplication of e
 Raising e to zero or a negative integer exponent can be understood as repeated division
 a rational number exponent can be defined by radicals of e, and an irrational number exponent can be defined by finding rational-number exponents that are arbitrarily close to the irrational-number exponent, in a limit process
 However, to define and understand a complex number exponent of e, a different type of generalization is required for the concept of exponentiation
 In fact, several definitions are possible
 All of them can be proven to be well-defined and equivalent, although the proofs are not included in this article
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following series is equal to ex: 
 This invites the following definition of ez for complex z: This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, the series converges for any z
 a simple-to-state, equivalent definition is that ez, for complex z, is the analytic continuation of the function ex for real x
 This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, it yields a single-valued function on the complex plane
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following limit is equal to ex: This motivates the following definition of ez for complex z: For real x, the function f=ex is well-known to be the unique real function satisfying the differential equation: for all x
 This motivates a definition of f = ez for complex z as the function that satisfies the differential equation: for all complex z, where the derivative in f' is defined in the sense of a complex derivative
 This can be proven to yield a unique function which is well-defined everywhere on the complex plane
 We would expect the function ez to have the following properties: It turns out that this uniquely specifies a function on the complex plane
 Various proofs of this formula are possible
 The first proof below starts with the "taylor series definition" of ez, while the other two use the "differential equation definition" of ez
 Here is a proof of Euler's formula using Taylor series expansionsas well as basic facts about the powers of i: and so on
 The functions ex, cos x and sin x of the variable x can be expressed using their Taylor expansions around zero: For complex z we define each of these functions by the above series, replacing the real variable x with the complex variable z
 This is possible because the radius of convergence of each series is infinite
 We then find that The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent
 Taking z = x to be a real number gives the original identity as Euler discovered it
 Define the function ƒ, of real variable x, as The derivative of ƒ, according to the product rule, is: Therefore, ƒ must be a constant function in x
 Because ƒ is known, the constant that ƒ equals for all real x is also known
 Thus, Multiplying both sides by eix and using it follows that QED Define the function g by Considering that i is constant, the first and second derivatives of g are because i 2 = −1 by definition
 From this the following 2nd-order linear ordinary differential equation is constructed: or Being a 2nd-order differential equation, there are two linearly independent solutions that satisfy it: Both cos and sin are real functions in which the 2nd derivative is identical to the negative of that function
 Any linear combination of solutions to a homogeneous differential equation is also a solution
 Then, in general, the solution to the differential equation is for any constants a and B
 But not all values of these two constants satisfy the known initial conditions for g: However these same initial conditions are resulting in and, finally, Q

 Solar telescopes are commonly used to detect wavelengths in or around Yashma

 How does our memory work or how can we remember anything? How is memory stored in our brain? Why do we forget something and forget things
 in moolbhoot prashnon ne maanav man ko sadaa se hi andolit kiya he tathaa inke uttar dene ke samay samay par prayaas bhi kiye gaye hai
 All of us have the ability to remember old things

 Learn something from them
 phir aage unhen anubhavon or gyaan ke rup main surakshit kar lete hai
 The behavior ahead of us is controlled by what we have learned
 prarambh main smriti kii tulana kisi bhautik sthaan se kii jaati thi or usamen sangrahit soochnaaon ko us sthaan main rakhe gaye vibhinn vastuon ke taur par dekha jaataa tha

 pustkaalay ek bhautik sthaan arthath sampurna smriti kaa nirupan karata he or usamen rakhi pustaken vibhinn soochnaaon kii tarah hoti hai
 This interpretation of memory was also recognized for a long time
 lekin baad main tark ke aadhaar par isaki pramanikta par andeh pragat kiya jane laga
 It was observed that this interpretation of memory was correct at the initial stage but it failed to properly explain the different processes of memory such as recall of an old event and creation of new memories
 smriti ko samajhane ke liye or bhi nae siddhant aae
 Of these, the theory inspired by computer science proved to be the most appropriate
 smriti kii is nai vyakhya ko tantrika sanjaal model ke aadhaar par prastut kiya gaya tha
 According to this, memory is distributed in parallel rather than centered in our brain
 yah vitaran sookshm ikaiyaan jo ki tantrika koshika ke samatuly hoti hai, kii bani hoti hai
 In these units, memory is represented as a kind of activation model
 aadhunik paribhaasha ke anusaar hamaari smriti ek samuhik prakram he jiske teen mukhya charan hote hai
 In the first phase, the information is encoded
 iske pashchaat dwitiya charan main in kutabaddh soochnaaon kaa sangrahan hota he or antim tritiy charan main inkaa punassmaran kiya jaataa he
 In order to feel the environment around us, it is necessary that the environmental stimuli are received by the senses related to it
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi vastu ko dekhne ke liye ham us par se paravartit prakaash ko netron dwaara grahan karte hai
 Now this reflected light converts sensory nerve cells present in the retina of the eye into faint electromagnetic waves

 Now this light electromagnetic wave goes into the visual field of the brain and is explained here

 After coding the information comes the place of their storage
 yah sangrahan samvedi str yaa alpakaaleen smriti ke str yaa dirghakaalin smriti ke str par ho saktaa he
 It will be noted here that there may be little change in information in our brain at the time of storage
 matlab ki suchanaaen vahiin nahin rahengi jaisi ve vaastavik rup main thim
 We can add something from them or we can remove any part of that information
 agar aadhi adhuri soochna he to ham use apni kalpana shakti ke aadhaar par garh bhi sakate hai
 Due to this property, memory is a formative process
 smriti kaa atirikt str par vargeekaran smriti main soochnaaon ke sangrahan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 How do we know that we have memory of a particular time or place? Only when we remember it
 udhaaharan ke liye agar poocha jaae ki apane bachapan ke paanch shikshakon ke naam bataaie jinaki shikshaaon ne aapke jivan par sabase adhik prabhaav daalaa he to hamen uttar dene main der nahin lagegaa
 But if we ask that the names of Nobel Prize scientists in biology or any field from 2000 to 2005 can be given, then we may have to think for some time

 Hence remembrance is an essential part of total memory
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki smriti ke vibhinn prakramon kii kriyavidhi kya he? smriti kii uparokt prakramon ko samajhane ke liye 1968 main atkinson tathaa siphrine ne smriti kii bahustareey sangrahan kii vyakhya prastut kii
 According to this definition there are three main collections of memory
 hamaari gyanendriyaan kisi bhi soochna ko vaataavaran se grahan karke use mastishk tak pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Later a conclusion is made by the brain based on that information
 ham dekhne, sunne yaa twachaa dwaara sheet yaa garmi kii anubhuti kaa udhaaharan le sakate hai
 Any atmospheric stimulus such as light or sound is first stored in a coded form for a very short period of time in their respective senses
 yah sangrahan atyalp samay ke liye hota he
 Its range of sight is 0
5 seconds and its time limit for hearing is around 2 seconds
 is samay seemaa ke pashchaat is sangrahit smriti kaa kshay ho jaataa he
 Information at the physical level is still preliminary and one cannot draw conclusions from it
 inkaa mastishk dwaara sangyojan tathaa parimarjan abhi baaki hota he
 When the information received by the senses comes to our attention, then they become part of the short term memory
 yahaan ullekhneey he ki samvedi str kii ve sabhi suchanaaen jin par ham dhyaan nahin dete ve samaapt ho jaati hai
 Only those information on which we concentrate become short-term memories
 alpakaaleen smriti ko kriyaatmak smriti bhi kaha jaataa he
 The best example of this type of memory is the recall of a phone number by us
 jab ham kisi number ko dekh kar use dial karte hai to do bate hoti hai
 First we look at the number and remember it by repeating it a few times, then after dialing the number we usually forget it
 atah is prakaar kii smriti ke sambandh main do nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai
 First, the capacity of short-term memory is very low
 Second, if there is a slight decrease in concentration in this type of memory, then our attention is not left
 phone vaale udhaaharan main agar number yaad karne or dial karne ke bich main koi duusari baat ho jaae to hamen number yaad nahin rahegaa
 Scientists have discovered that the total storage of information in this type of memory is only 20 to 30 seconds
 lekin agar soochna ko doharaaya jaae to yah samay 20 se 30 second se adhik bhi ho saktaa he
 And if you repeat it carefully again and again, this information gets converted into long term memory
 jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he dirghakaalin smritiyaan sthai hoti hai
 We use this memory in many ways
 aaj subah hamane naashte main kya khaaya? parason hamaare ghar koun-koun milane aayaa tha? un logon ne koun se kapade pahan rakhe the? hamane apana pichhlaa janmdin kahaan or kaise manaaya tha? ham cycle kaise chalaa lete hai se lekar varg paheli hal karne tak, in sari gatividhiyon main hamaari yah smriti hamaara saath detii he
 This type of memory is the most diverse and our feelings, experiences and knowledge etc
 are reflected in all these forms
 alpakaaleen smriti kii suchanaaen baar-baar duharai jane ke baad dirghakaalin smriti ban jaati hai
 This memory does not decay but may change
 ab tak smriti kii kriyavidhi par baat ho rahi thi
 The question remains as to how our brain stores these information and which activities of the nervous system are responsible for it
