 The etymological meaning of 'asura' is pranavanta, rich in life and thus it is treated as a common adjective of Vedic gods

 He was the most important and most talented diplomat of his time
 nepolian kii waterlu paraajay ke baad meternikh europe kii raajnneeti kaa sarvesarva ban gaya
 He played such a prominent role in European politics that the period of European history from 1815 to 1848 is famous as 'metternich era'
 meternikh ne apane pradhanmantritatv-kaal main pratikraya or anudaarita kaa anukaran karne kii niti apanaai or uske prabhaav ke kaaran austria kaa samrajya europe main atyant mahatvapurn ban gaya
 Maternich was born in May 1773 in the city of Kabalej, Austria
 vah kuleen shrenee ke khandaan kaa vyakti tha
 During his university education, he had heard the sorrow of the elites who had fled as a result of the French Revolution and from that time on he became a fierce enemy of revolutionary sentiments

 main samaajwaadiyon, udaarvaadiyon or rashtravaadiyon ne vienna main matternik kaa rajmahal gher liya to vah gupt rup se england bhaag gaya
 After some time he came back to Vienna where he died in 1859
 matternik kranti kaa kattar shatru tha
 According to him, revolution was a severe contagious disease and this infectious disease should be prevented quickly
 vah raja ko ishwar kaa pratinidhi maanata tha
 He was a supporter of autocratic rule
 vah yathasthiti ko kaayam rakhane kaa pakshdhar tha
 The maternal system and its policy were mainly based on the Austrian need
 vastutah vibhinn jati, bhashaa, dharm, parampara ke log austria main rahete the
 The rise of nationalist sentiment in such an empire divides the state into pieces
 aisi sthiti main matternik kii niti kisi bhi keemat par yathasthiti banaae rakhane tathaa ubhartee hui rashtravaadi bhaavana ko kuchal daalane kii thi
 Maternik blocked the entry of liberal ideology into Austria
 iske tahat usne vichaar swatantry par ankush lagaaya
 Liberal ideology prohibited books from entering the empire
 austriavaasiyon ko videsh jane se roak diya
 University teachers and students were kept under close watch by spies
 is tareeke se matternik ne austria kii rashtriyata ar kranti kii bhaawanaaon se alag rakhaa
 Maternic was well aware that his Austria could remain intact only when such a system was implemented in other regions of Europe
 isi sandarbh ke usne germany main sangh kaa nirmaan kar udaaravaadi andolan ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 By declaring Carlsism, it banned nationalist institutions, controlled newspapers and prohibited the promotion of liberalism
 jab germany main 1830 i
 main in pratibandhon kaa virodh hua to matternik ne mitra deshon kii sahaayta se use kuchal daalaa
 Similarly, in Italy, the nationalist / liberal movement was suppressed
 1815-28 tak matternik kii safalataa kaa kaal tha
 Progressive ideology remained blocked and reactionary ideology prevailed during this period
 isi sandarbh main yah kaha gaya ki "ek klaant or bhiru peedi ke liye matternik ek upyukt vyakti tha
 " france kii kranti or nepolian ke yudhon ke pashchaat europe ke raajnneetik patal par matternik kaa udai ek nae yug kaa suchak tha jise saamanytah matternik yug kaha jaataa he
 This era lasted from 1815–1848 and in this period it governed the politics of Europe in its own way
 pratikriyaavaadi or pragatisheel vichaardhaaraon main jabardast sangharsh is yug kii visheshta thi
 On the one hand, the spirit of nationalism was democracy and on the other, it was the spirit of conservatism and reactionaryism
 matternik pratikriyaavaadi vichaardhaara kaa samarthak tha uski sari niti kaa suutaravakya tha- "shashan karo or koi parivartan na hone do
 "the methods he used to carry out his proceduralist policy were called the 'maternal system'"
 is vyavastha kaa uddeshy europe main santulan kaayam karnaa tha
 The balance that was dissolved by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars

 The collapse of these revolutionary feelings was achieved
 uske vichaar main kranti ek beemaari thi jiske bhadakne par uskaa koi bhi nidaan nahin rah jaataa he
 Therefore, this disease should be suppressed as soon as its symptoms are seen before taking a violent form

 He considered the king to be the messenger of God and the representative of this god gets every right to settle the fate of the people and he is never responsible to the people
 in siddhanton kaa vah man se samarthak tha evam apane jeevanaparyant in siddhanton ko vyavhaar main laayaa
 Metternich was a great diplomat
 vah asaadhaaran pratibha kaa dhani tha
 Austria played an important part in defeating the Napoleonic commander, so the European Nations Conference was held in Vienna in 1815 to decide matters of reconstruction from Europe and was most impressed by the National Chancellor Metternich with his eccentric diplomatic talent
 yah meterrikh hi tha jisase austria ko itnaa shaktishaalee bana diya tha ki europe main punah uskaa varchasv sthapit ho gaya
 austria-hungary ruled Francis i from 1792 to 1835 and Ferdinand i from 1835 to 1848
 sampoorn europe main austria hi ek aisa rajya tha jis par 1789 kii francisi kranti kaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa tha
 The rule of the privileged nobles and clergy throughout the empire was absolutely rinkish
 kisi prakaar ke udaar vichaaron kaa prachaar nahin ho saktaa tha
 Where Napoleon's era was the Weapon of Arms, there was the Metternich Era, the State or Minister's Era
 meternikh apane yug kaa sabase pratibhashali raajnneetijna tha
 He had a major hand in the fall of Napoleon and the organization of the European system
 us yug ke lagbhag sabhi shaasha meterrikh ke prabhavit the
 Central and Eastern Europe national and international legislation used to follow the policy of Metternich
 germany, austria or italy uski hi chhatrachhaaya main the
 In fact, just as Napoleon held sway over the whole of Europe for 15 years, in the same way Metternich continued to control Europe's political progress for nearly 40 years
 vah bada hi ahamkaari vyakti tha jisaki dharna thi ki sansar kaa kram usee ke sahare chal rahaa he
 He used to say- "in my situation, the unique thing is that wherever i am, everybody's hopes, eyes of everyone remain there
" kya kaaran he ki asankhya logon main keval main hi vichaar karata hoon jabaki anya vyakti kuch nahin sochate; keval main hi kaary karata hoon jabaki anya log kuch bhi nahin karte; or main hi likhata hoon kyonki duusare is yogya nahin hai
 "matterich believed that his blanks could never be filled when he died
 meternikh krantikari bhaawanaaon kaa kattar shatru tha
 He considered two important principles of the French Revolution, nationalism and democracy, as 'very terrible diseases'
 vah kaha karata tha ki kranti ke bhayankar rog ko sheeghra hi rokna chahie, anyathaa vah atyant shighrata se fail kar bheeshan rup dhaaran kar legaa jisase sampoorn europe nasht ho jaayegaa
 Metternich often used to say - "revolution is like a terrible and giant monster that can swallow the social and political system of all Europe
" " meternikh kii drushti main, "kranti ek sade hue durgandhyukt maance ke tukade ke samaan thi jisko bhasma karne ke liye ek atyant garam or laal lohe kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 "metternich was extremely irritated by the revolution
 uskaa rajnay is disha main tha ki sampoorn europe main kranti se purv kii sthiti punah utpann karke puraatan raajnneetik vyavastha kii jaye
 Metternich considered it his sacred duty to protect the Kingdom of Austria
 yah tabhi sambhav tha jab francisi kranti dwaara pratipaadit siddhanton ko kuchal diya jaye
 Metternich knew that the empire of Austria was a confluence of many castes and that such an empire could not be governed on the basis of principles of nationality
 use yah kabhi bardaasht nahin tha ki sarsaadhaaran janata raajnneetik adhikaar praapt kare or desh ke shashan-sanchaalan main laag le, atah austrian samrajya kii kranti kii laharon se bachaane ke liye meternikh ne ek aisi paddati kaa sutarapaat kiya jise ‘meternikh paddati' kaha jaataa he
 Metternich resorted to diplomatic and political pressure, not power, to make his policy a success
 uski yah pranali tatkaaleen europea vyavastha se bhinn thi, isliye uski niti ko uske naam par ‘meternikh pranali’ kaa naam diya gaya
 This Metternich system had two distinct forms - meternikh ne apane pradhanmantritatv-kaal main pratikraya or anudaarita kaa anukaran karne kii niti apanaai or uske prabhaav ke kaaran austria kaa samrajya europe main atyant mahatvapurn ban gaya
 Explaining his policy, he once wrote to the Prime Minister of England, Palmerston, that "we are adopting antagonistic policy because we do not have to be helpless to adopt a repressive policy
" hamaari yahi nishchit dharna he ki sudhaar kii maangon ko sweekaar karnaa rajya ke liye ghaatak hoga
 " meternikh kaa vishwaas tha ki grih-niti or videsh-niti ko pruthak-pruthak nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Events in one country have an impact on other countries
 atah kisi desh main ghatit ghatnaon ko koi desh darshak kii bhaanti nahin dekh saktaa
 States should jointly intervene to suppress it
 sarvapratham meternikh ne apni vyavastha ko apane hi desh main lagu kiya
 From 1815 to 1818 he was the all-powerful Prime Minister of Austria
 is avadhi main austria main do samraat hue- pratham francis or ferdinand pratham 
 He advised both emperors to follow the same policy, that was the policy of maintaining the 'status quo'
 iske atirikt usne austria-hungary samrajya main udaar vichaaron kaa daman or kathor niyantran kii bhi niti apanaai
 Metternich was a very selfish politician
 austria main yah sambhav tha ki pratikriya ke shikanje ko khub majboot kar diya jaye, lekin samrajya ke baahar bhi naveen or udaar vichaaron ke prachaar ko rokna atyant aavashyak tha
 At the same time it was also the desire of Metternich to lead Austria in Europe
 meternikh nepolian kii badhati hui shakti se parichit tha
 He once said, "if France gets a cold, the whole of Europe starts sneezing
 " saath hi vah yah bhi jaanata tha ki rus kaa jaar bhi austria kaa shatru he, atah usne aisi niti apanaai ki nepolian or rus paraspar ladakar nasht ho jaayen taaki austria europe kaa shaktishaalee rajya bana rahe
 Maternich pushed Russia forward to defeat Napoleon and himself secretly made plans against the ruler of Russia
 nepolian ne jab 1812 main rus par hamalaa kiya to meternikh ne rus ke jaar ko vishwaas dilaayaa tha ki vah kisi bhi ore se yuddh main sakriy bhaag nahin legaa, par duusari ore usne nepolian kii sahaayta ke liye sena taiyaar rakhi
 In fact, Metternich was ready to help only that which would benefit Austria
 isliye usne austria kii sena ko sadaiv is drushti se taiyaar rakhaa tha ki vah vijayi dal kaa saath de sake
 He allied with the Allies in the Battle of Leiptsig and took a major part to defeat Napoleon
 apni dohari niti or duusari ore vijay kaa yash rus ko nahin milane diya
 Therefore, in the Vienna Congress, all nations aspired for the friendship of Metternich
 nepolian pratham ke baad europe main koi bhi raajnneetijna aisa nahin tha jo meternikh kii barabari kar saktaa
 Therefore, the pride of Austria increased in the Vienna Congress
 austria kaa yah chancelar vienna congress kaa sabhapati bana
 Metternich had the most influence on the decisions of the Vienna Congress
 nepolian ke paraabhav ke baad bhi uske siddhanton ko bhay bana hua tha
 Metternich understood that Austria could also be influenced by the principles of freedom, equality and fraternity
 atah iske sambhavit prasar ko rokane ke liye usne vienna congress main sakriy bhoomika nibhai
 While emphasizing the principle of autocracy and justice, he kept the balance of European power and adopted such a policy that the selfishness of all the big nations should be fulfilled as soon as possible
 meternikh samajhataa tha ki bade rashtron main ekta banaae rakhane kaa yahi maarg he
 It was Maternich's diplomacy that the power of France was well limited and such arrangements were made between Austria and France that the revolutionary ideas of France could not enter Austria
 meternikh kii kootneeti kaa hi yah jaadu tha ki austria ko lambardi, venice or babasiyaa mil gaye
 The borders of many states of Europe remained the same
 pracheen rajwanshon kii punarsthapana kii tathaa kshatigrast rajyon kii kshatipurti kii vyavastha karai
 He cast his spell on the Tsar of Russia and the King of Prussia
 usne german rajya kaa sanghathan kiya, kintu sab kaa pradhan austria ke raja ko banaaya gaya
 In fact, the aims and decisions of the Vienna Congress were mostly the product of Metternich's intelligence
 vienna congress ke nirnyon ko sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye meternikh ne sanyukt vyavastha kii sthapana kii
 Maternich had the amazing ability to transform a quadrilateral friendship into action
 sanyukt vyavastha ke rup main usne ek aise ‘fire brigade’ kaa nirmaan karnaa chaha tha jo europe main sarvatra kranti kii jwaalaon ko buja de
 Through this system, Maternich tried to bring peace to Europe that was shackled by Napoleon's wars
 yah duusari baat he ki uski niti se jo parivartan hue ve sthaayee na rah sake kyonki unamem udaar or rashtriya bhaawanaaon kaa abhaav tha
 Nevertheless, he succeeded in maintaining peace in Europe for 30 years
 nepolian ke yudhon ne germany kshat-vikshat ho gaya tha; phir bhi vienna congress main usne apane samarthakon kii sahaayta main germany main 39 rajyon kaa ek sangh sthapit kiya
 The Austrian Emperor became its president
 iske saath hi rajya-sangh main ek sansad kii sthapana kii gai jisamen germany ke sabhi raajaaon dwaara niyukt pratinidhi bhaag le sakate the
 With the help of this system, Maternich crushed their feelings by punishing the supporters of democracy
 usne 1819 main sansad kaa adhiveshan bulaakar apni icchaanukool damankaaree kanoon paarit karake unhen sampoorn germany main lagu kara diya
 Due to these strict instructions, from 1818 to 1849 there was political silence in Germany
 meternikh ke bhay se germany ke kuch rajyon ke atirikt kisi bhi rajya main samvidhanik shashan sthapit na ho sakaa
 Due to the oppressive policy and diplomatic tactics of Metternich, the disturbances and movements in Germany became peaceful, but the German public began to hate Austria
 meternikh kii damankaaree niti se janata upar se shant ho gai lekin bheetar-hi-bheetar kranti kii aag sulagati rahi
 Prussia was a powerful state of Germany that advanced in the fields of trade and art-skills
 vahaan meternikh kii damankaaree niti kaa prayog vishesh faldaayak nahin ho sakaa
