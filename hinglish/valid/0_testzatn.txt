 Purusharth in Hinduism refers to the goal or purpose of a human being
 purusharth = purush+arth = arthath maanav ko 'kya' praapt karne kaa praytn karnaa chaiye
 The name of four Purusharthas have been taken from the Vedas for man - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha
 isliye inhen 'purusharthchatushtay' bhi kehete hai
 Maharishi Manu is the exponent of Purushartha Chatushtaya
 charvak darshan keval do hi purusharth ko manyata detaa he- arth or kaam
 He does not believe in religion and salvation
 maharishi vatsyayan bhi manu ke purusharth-chatushtay ke samarthak hai kintu ve moksh tathaa paralok kii apeksha dharm, arth, kaam par aadhaarit sansaarik jivan ko sarvopari maanate hai

 That is, religion was linked to both the physical and other aspects of life

 Under this, the means and rules of the highest development of human life are included

 But for this, a solid foundation of righteousness is required

 Religion has suggested to us that we should always strive to return more than we have taken from nature and society
 shastron ne arth ko maanav kii sukh-suvidhaon kaa mul mana he
 Religion also has its root meaning
 sukh praapt karne ke liye sabhi arth kii kaamana karte hai
 Therefore, Acharya Kautilya considers the meaning in the trinity as the root of religion and work
 bhoomi, dhan, pashu, mitra, vidya, kala va krishi sabhi arth kii shrenee main aate hai
 It is not possible to determine their number because it depends on the requirements of human life
 manushya swabhaavatah kaamana pradhan hota he, yah kahana bhi galat nahin hoga vah kaamanamay hota he
 Meaning is the only means to fulfill all these desires
 acharya vatsyayan 'arth' ko paribhaashit karte hue vidya, sona, chaandi, dhan, dhaany gruhasthi kaa saamaan, mitra kaa arjan evam jo kuch praapt hua he yaa arjeet hua he uskaa vardhan sab arth he
 According to Maharishi Vatsyayan, abhimaanik sukh ke saath anubaddh falvrat arth pritati kaam kehalaata he
 Further, while presenting the comparative superiority of the meaning, religion and work, it has been said that the Trigarga community is superior to the former
 kaam se shreshth arth he tathaa arth se shreshth dharm he
 But it varies from person to person
 madhwacharya ke anusaar vishaybhed ke anusaar kaam do prakaar kaa hota he
 The first of these is called normal work
 jab aatma kii shabdic vishyon ke bhogane kii ichha hoti he to us samay aatma kaa praytn gun utpann hota he
 That is, the soul is first united with the mind and the mind is connected with the subjects
 strot, tvach, chakshu, jiva tathaa dhran indriya kii kramshah sparsh, rup, ras, gandh main pravrutt hote hai
 In this nature of work, the justice-specific view is more visible

 That is, the soul experiences happiness through the intellect through the subjects

 Cast iron is generally called gray colored iron but at the same time it is a mixture of iron ores in a large mass, which becomes solid in a eutectic manner
 kisi bhi dhaatu kii khandit sataha ko dekhakar uske mishra dhaatu hone kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 White cast iron is named on the basis of its fractured white surface because it contains carbide impurities, causing a straight crack

 More than 95% of the weight of substances found in the alloy is iron while the other main elements include carbon and silicon
 dhalwaan lohe main carbon kii maatra 2

 Cast iron has become an engineering material with a wide range of applications, pipes and machines and automotive, with low melting point, good fluidity, sizing ability, excellent sizing ability, resistance to deformation and resistance to wear
 It is used in parts of the industry, such as cylinder heads, cylinder blocks and gearbox boxes

 The use of cast iron for structural purposes began in the late decades of 1770, when Abraham Derby III built an iron bridge, although smaller beams were already in place, such as have been used in blast furnaces at Colebrookdale
 
 thomas pine ke ek patent ke baad, anya avishkaar bhi shaamil hai
 Cast iron bridges became common as the Industrial Revolution began to gain momentum

 nichle kinaaron main kam tanaav ke saath, bims ke kendron main jhukaav tha, jisame dhalwaan lohe kii tarah, chinai kaaphi kamjor thi
 The best way to use cast iron for the construction of a bridge is to use arches, so that all materials remain in compression
 Cast iron, again like masonry, is very strong in compression

 Nevertheless, improper structural use of cast iron continued until the severe crash of the Tay Rail Bridge in 1879, for which the quality of the material in use was heavily suspected

 In addition, the bolt holes were also not pierced with the perforator, all the stresses falling on the length of the tie rods instead of extending the length of the holes which were placed in one corner

 Further, the bridge collapsed, however, in 1891, a rail accident occurred at Norwood Junction
 Thousands of cast iron rails were eventually replaced with steel equivalents in bridges built under railway lines

 Geometry is that branch of mathematics in which the study of points, lines, curves, planes, etc
, is studied
 bhoomi ke naap sambandhi kaaryon se is vigyaan kii utpatti hui, isaliye is ganit ko bhumiti bhi kehete hai
 Initially this study was limited to the properties of lines and areas surrounded by lines, due to which geometry is also named Geometry

 Historians believe that Indians knew such relationships as 32 + 42 = 52, 1,000 years before Christ, but they did not study such relationships in any other way except for some similar small equations

 Although the study of geometry started almost simultaneously in all the old civilized countries, such as Egypt, Babylonia, China, India and Greece, but no other country has progressed as much in this science as Greece
 isa se lagbhag 300 varsh purv yunaan ke ek ganitaj euclid ne us samay tak jitne tathy gyaat the un sabko bade tarkpurna dhang se krambaddh kiya
 He tried to prove other facts on the basis of known facts
 is prakaar tathyon ko krambaddh karne par vah kuch aise praarambhik tathyon par pahunchaa jinako siddh karnaa kathin he
 Well they seem very clear
 ye tathy itane saral hai ki euclid ne inhen swayansiddh maan liya or inhen swayan tathy kaha he
 The proof of theorems of geometry is dependent on these facts
 ve tathy nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Those things, which are equal to the same thing, are also equal among themselves
 2
 yadi baraabar vastuon main baraabar vastuen jod di jaayan to yogafal baraabar hote hai

 isi prakaar rachanakaarya main bhi ek rachana se duusari rachana kar sakate hai, parantu ant main kuch aisi rachanaaon par pahonchte hai jinka prayog duusare prayogon par nirbhar nahin karata
 These compositions can also be taken forward by considering themselves
 ve Apart from these, they do not accept any other facts without proving them

 Mathematicians objected to this fact as axiomatic and tried hard to prove it
 inhen yatnon ke falswaroop bade bade avishkaar hue
 Similarly, new geographical terms are mentioned in geometry
 ek shabd kii paribhaasha duusare shabdon kii paribhaasha par nirbhar karti he
 Finally, let us see that these definitions are based on the definitions of point, line and plane
 euclid ke anusaar samtal vah he jisamen lambaai chaudaai ho, parantu motaai na ho
 Many people are skeptical of this definition as well, but a little reflection will make it clear that the definition is correct
 udaahranarth, yadi kaanch ke ek baratan main do aise taral padaarth bhar die jaayan jo aapas main na milte ho to jab ve sthir ho jaayan tab ham dekhgen ki ek tal donon padaarthon ko alag karata he
 It does not have thickness
 yadi hoti to donon taralon ke bich aisa sthaan hota jisamen na neeche kaa padaarth hota na upar kaa, parantu aisa asambhav he
 This example would have made it clear that the floor does not have thickness
 isamen keval lambaai or chaudaai hi hoti he
 Similarly, looking at the shade of a flat wall in the sun, we can say that the line does not have width
 rekha tal main sthit he, at: tal kii motaai rekha kii motaai hui
 Therefore the line has neither thickness nor width, only length
 rekhaayen ek bindu par milti hai to rekha kii chaudaai bindu kii lambaai hui, arthath bindu main na lambaai hoti he, na chaudaai, motaai
 There is only space

 The solutions to those questions gave a lot of thought, there is no doubt in this, like making a cube whose cube is twice the given cube
 us samay rachana kaa arth patari or parkaar kii sahaayta se hi rachana karnaa samajha jaataa tha
 The second question was to make a square whose area is equal to the area of the given circle
 teesraa prashn tha ki ek die hue kone ko teen baraabar bhaagon main baantna
 This work is impossible with track and compass, but can be done by other means
 in prashnon ne shatabdiyon tak ganitagyon ko vyast rakhaa
 Mathematics was greatly benefited by his deliberations, no doubt
 ek shanku ko kisi samtal se kaatane se jo dirghavritt, paravalay, tathaa atiparavalay vakr banate hai unke gunon kaa bhi unaniyon ne adhyayan kiya
 These studies may have helped Kaplan in finding his rules

 This goal attracted the attention of mathematicians to another type of geometry called projectional geometry
 yadi ham kisi drishy ke chitra par dhyaan den to anubhav karte hai ki use dekhakar drishy kaa puraa gyaan ho jaataa he
 But in the picture, the circle is not a circle, neither all the parallel lines are parallel, neither the right angle is the right angle, but sometimes the right angle is seen to be a right angle, sometimes more angle; Nevertheless, there are some such qualities in the scene that even after changing the shapes, they get complete knowledge from the picture
 ye gun nishchar kehalaate hai
 Similar properties are studied in projectional geometry
 maan len, ek bindu ba or ek chaturbhuj k kha ga gha diya hua he

 These properties will also be good for the original polygon
 saath hi kai roopantaran milakar ek roopantaran prayog ke samaan hote hai
 The study of these experiments is also a part of this geometry

 The 5th axiomatic fact of Euclid has been given above
 ise swayansiddh maanane ke liye ganitagya kabhi taiyaar nahin hue, balki unhone ise siddh karne ke bade bade ytn kiye; parantu kaai santoshjanak uttar nahin mila
 Mathematics developed a lot as a result of research and a geometry was invented which created a complete revolution in geometry
 euclid ne samtal par hi sab vivechan kiye, parantu ab har prakaar ke talon par alag alag vivechnaayen hoti hai
 Its interpretation is difficult, so for this, the readers should look at the special books on this subject
 17veen shatabdi ke madhya main francisi ganitagya decort ne jyamiti main bijganit kaa prayog kar ise bahut shaktishaalee bana diya
 He first took two cutting lines, called axes
 kisi bindu kii in rekhaon ke samaantar naapi hui duuri do sankhyaon ya r se uskaa sthaan nishchay kiya
 These lines are called the coordinates of the point
 in nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se prayek jyamitiya tathy ko bijaganitiya sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 This geometry developed in many directions
 pehali dasha main to jyamiti kaa vyapak rup saamne aayaa, jaise ek ghaat kaa sameekaran ek saral rekha pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equation of two powers represents a conic
 isi prakaar teen, chaar or ucchtar ghaaton ke samikarnon kaa adhyayan hone laga or unke sangat vakron ke gunon kaa vivechan pehle se bahut saral ho gaya
 It became possible to study not only the curves of the floor but also the curves of the recess
 iske liye ek bindugami teen samatalon se kisi bindu kii duriyon ya r l na uskaa sthaan nishchit karte hai or prayek bindupath ko ya, r, l main ek sameekaran dwaara pradarshit karte hai
 By considering these equations, the properties of the planes and curves are easily studied
 duusari disha main rachana sambandhi prashnon kaa hal tathaa kriyaayein bahut saral ho gayi
 These verbs depend only on the solution of some equations, in which very broad questions are easily solved; For example, if the line intersects a curve = o, the solution of both these equations will determine the location of their intersection points
 yadi in samikarnon ke mul vaastavik hai, to rekha vakr ko katati he
 If equal, the line touches the curve
 yadi kaalpanik hai to rekha vakr ko nahin katati, parantu ham yah kah sakate hai ki rekha vakr ko sadaiv do binduon par kaategi, chaahe bindu vaastavik yaa sampati hon, athwa kaalpanik hon
 Similarly, facts can be given in a very broad form, which was not possible in ordinary geometry
 teesri disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne vimiti ko vyapak kiya
 Two numbers are Y, r in two dimensions and three numbers determine the position of a point in three dimensions
 ab ganitagyon ke saamne yah prashn uthaa ki chaar sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va yaa paanch sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va, ha kya pradarshit karengi
 Mathematicians thought very easily in their minds that abstract four numbers would determine the position of a point in four dimensions and five numbers in five dimensions
 is prakaar unhone sa vimitiyon kaa vichaar bhi acchhee tarah soch liya
 He does not mean whether there is any example of him in the earthly world
 instine ne avashya is vichaar kaa apane saapeksh siddhant main upyog kiya or vimiti ke vichaar kaa spashtikaran kiya
 Now use this idea of high dimensionality to solve some difficult problems in untapped mathematics
 jaise kisi chal taral padaarth ke bhinn bhinn kanon kaa sthaan, saat sankhyaon se pradarshit karte hai
 They are A, B, C, its initial position, and three velocities, which are parallel to Y, R, l axis, and time, this can be solved by considering the question of seven dimensions
 chauthi disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne sankhyaon kaa vyapkikaran kiya or kaalpanik sankhyaon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 Concepts such as hypothetical points and imaginary curves, etc
, made geometry very important, which further helped in generalization, such as the conic circle going from two imaginary points at infinity, etc
 iske atirikt jyamiti kaa vivechan bhinn bhinn prakaar ke nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se hone laga, jaise samghaateey nirdeshaank, trikoniya nirdeshaank, sparsheey nirdeshaank ityadi
 Almost 50 years after the use of coordinates, calculus was also used in geometry
 is prayog ne jyamiti main nai nai vichaardhaaraen utpann kin
 These are called differential geometry
