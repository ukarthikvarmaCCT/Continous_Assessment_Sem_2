 purvi asia main ming vansh ke shashan-kaal main jis, jati kaa sarvapratham aagaman hua vah portuguese thi
 In 1498, Vasco da Gama laid his feet on Indo-land while traveling to the seaside regions of Africa
 Portuguese traveler Vasco da Gama benefited from the journey that the people of the Western countries, primarily in immediate transit to the Portuguese, to the eastern countries Route detected
 isliye unka prasthaan tathaa vistaar ab anya deshon main bhi hone laga
 He reached China at the time of taking over Malacca in the early 16th century
 china main unki pahunch 1514 i
 main hui
 As soon as he came to China, he became involved in business
 yahan ke vyapaaree china se vilasapriy chizon ko kharidne lage or pashchimi deshon main unka vikray kiya jane laga jahaan prasadhano kii maang thi
 But the Portuguese could not please the Chinese by their behavior
 inke vyavhaar tathaa aadaten acchhee nahin thi keval portguese hi bure nahin the, anya jatiyon kii bhi aisi hi aadaten thim
 When the people of Spain reached America, the life of the original castes there also became very annoying due to them
 spain ke logon ke virodh kiye jane par bhi america nahin choda or vahaan bastiyon kaa nirmaan kar niyamit rup se bas gayi
 As soon as they settled regularly, they began to interfere in the religion, culture, living, etc
 of the American people
 itnaa hi nahin, bastiyon ke nirmaan ke saath-saath shanahshanaih ve upnivesh nirmaan kii ore bhi unmukh hue isi silsile main spainvasi china bhi pahunche
 The Spanish came to China after the Portuguese
 america main is jati ne jis prakaar kii harakat kii thi, usase china ke log parichit hi the
 Therefore, as soon as the arrival of this caste took the seeds of colonization on Chinese soil, the Chinese started opposing them
 ming sarkaar ne to is jati ke viruddh ek joardaar aandolan bhi prarambh kar diya
 This is the reason why the Spaniards could not melt in China like America
 ve china main na to apana astitv hi kaayam kar sake or na aakankshit bastiyon kaa hi nirmaan kar sake
 Commercial relations with the Portuguese were also established
 inase yah sambandh bhi kaayam nahin ho sakaa
 Nevertheless, the Spanish were stubborn
 america main jis prakaar ve balpurvak rahane lage the usee prakaar ve china main bhi rahane kaa prayaas kiye
 a group of them stayed in the famous port canton of China and tried to establish a commercial relationship with China
 ant main, atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main apane kaary main unhen safalataa mili or makaao main apni basti kaa nirmaan kar ve rahane lage
 At the same time, many religious missionaries from the west also came to China
 china main in mishnariyon ne dharm kaa prachaar karnaa prarambh kiya
 Initially the behavior of these missionaries was good, but later the Chinese people became aware of their selfish policy
 isi samay angrejon tathaa dachon kaa bhi aagaman china main hua
 But it should be remembered here that under the rule of the Ming dynasty, China had two kinds of relations with the Western countries - a trade relationship and a religious relationship
 pashchim ke desh dakshin ke bhukhndon kaa makaao tathaa canton se vyapaar karte the
 Traders from the west brought many grain-related plants and tobacco to their countries in China
 tambaaku kaa prachaar in logon ne kaaphi kiya
 Because of this, most of the people of China started consuming tobacco
 isi prakaar china se unka dharmik sambandh bhi kaayam tha
 Missionaries from western countries used to preach in the interior of China
 mongolon ke shashan ke baad china main isaayiyon kaa ant ho chalaa tha or unka prabhaav ghatane laga tha
 But in the last years of Ming Dynasty, Roman Catholics revived these Christians and their missionaries
 isi samay britain, france vagairah se franciscan, agstinian, juseit, dominian aadi anek dharmik sampradaay ke log china pahunch gayi
 It was only in the early years of the sixteenth century that the predominance of the Jesuit cult began to prevail in China
 is sampradaay kaa lokapriy prachaar francis jevirs tha jisase dakshini tathaa purvi asia main is sampradaay ko lokapriy banane kaa athak or athak prayaas kiya
 Not only this preacher propagated this community in China
 vastutah jevirs ke chalate hi china main yah sampradaay jivit ho sakaa
 At present, Javisarya had not even got complete success in his work that in 1556 AD he passed away from the world
 uski mrityu ke pashchaat uske kaary kaa bhaar mathhar ricki ne apane kandhon par liya
 Rikki was a resident of Italy
 jesuit sampradaay kii lok priyata badhaane ke liye usne ji jaan laga di ricki kii pratibha bahumukhi thi
 He was a scholar of astrology and mathematics
 itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki samprati china main jyotish tathaa ganit kaa koi bhi aisa vidwaan nahin tha jo ricki kii samta kar sake
 Due to his talent, he also studied China literature
 yah chini sahitya ricki ke liye purnatah nayaa vishay tha, phir bhi apane adhyavsaay tathaa pratibha ke chalate usne chini sahityakaron ke bich kaaphi pratishtha paayi
 He had to study his religion, he studied Confucius's religion and Christianity deeply and tried to keep the equality and inequality of both religions as a scholar
 china kii rajdhani peking main usne apana nivas sthal banaaya
 At the same time, the Spaniard also came to China from the Philippine
 abtak china main anek pashchimi jatiyaan aa gayi thim
 The Portuguese arrived in 1516 AD, the Spanish arrived in 1575 AD; The Dutch arrived in 1604 AD and the British arrived in 1637 AD
 par is samay tak amareeki tathaa roosi nahin aa paye the
 His arrival also occurred in China during the Ching reign
 1644 i
 main ming vansh kaa shashan samaapt ho gaya
 In the north, the conquerors named Manchu defeated Ming
 manchu manchuriya ke rahanevaale the
 In the latter half of the Sohalteenth and early Seventeenth centuries, they strengthened themselves and hijacked Mukden from Ming, which was also their capital
 mukden ko ve bhi apni rajdhani banaae
 The Mongols living in China also willingly or unwillingly accepted the rule of the Manchus
 manchuon ne china kii dakshini diwaar tak apni rajya-seemaa badhaane kaa prayaas kiya
 At the same time, when a feeling of dissatisfaction against the Ming was born in China, Manchuo took the opportunity to take control of Peking, and since then he started ruling in China
 konghsi or china lung is vansh ke sarvaadhik pratapi raja hue
 For a long time Manchuo ruled China
 manchookaal main bhi pashchimi logon kaa aagaman china main hua
 If truth be told, it is to be believed that it was during this period that the influence of Western countries in China started to build up and it was during this period that China's real relationship with foreign countries was established
 is kaal main videshon se log sthal tathaa donon margon se aaye
 Portugese, Spanish, French and English and some Italian and German came by sea
 isi samay 1784 i
 main amareeki vyapaaree bhi china aaye
 Only Russians came by land route who started trading in silver in China
 videshi rajyon se china main is samay ek sandhi bhi kii
 By this treaty Russia got the right to send a mission to Peking
 peking main rus kii mishanri bhi kaary karne lagi
 This relationship with America and Russia proved to be important for China
 china main is samay punah videshi mishnariyon kaa bhi aagaman hua
 Foreign missionaries also arrived at this time in eighteenth-century China
 atharahavin sadi ke prarambh tak china main isaayiyon kii sankhya 3,00,000 ho gayi thi
 In 1793, a British mission first came to China
 yah mishan mecortne ke netritv main china aayaa tha
 The second mission came to Peking in 1816 AD
 iskaa netritvkarta lard amherst tha
 At the same time, a mission under Robert Morishan also reached China
 is maukey se laabh uthaakar ab protestand mishnariyon ne china main apana kaary prarambh kiya
 Protestants looked down upon the Chinese and considered them rude
 angrejon kii dekha-dekhi dach mishnariyaan bhi china aayin or 1795 i
 main unka pehla mishan china pahunchaa
 Similarly, a messenger from Russia arrived in 1806 AD
 lekin china ne uske prati kisi bhi prakaar kii sahanubhuti kaa pradarshan nahin kiya
 Peking also reached the Gemuite of France and sang the glory of the Manchu emperor
 vibhinn mishnariyon main sarvaadhik chatur tathaa prabhaavshaalini angrejon kii mishnariyaan sabit huin
 If we compare the English missionaries with the various missionaries who came to China, then it becomes clear that in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the English missionary surpassed all
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej atyant chatur tathaa karmath the
 Due to his business acumen and political prowess, he did not allow other missionaries to advance in the competition and in future he was able to establish his influence in China
 uparyukt vivaran se spasht ho jaataa he ki china tathaa paashchaatya deshon ke bich sambandh kaayam ho chalaa tha or unnisvin sadi tak sampoorn china anek videshi tathaa unki mishnariyaan drushtigochar hone lagi thim
 But that relationship could not proceed peacefully
 china kii janata sarkaar in videshiyon tathaa unki mishnariyon se dhire-dhire ghrinaa karne lagi
 His idea was that China's civilization and culture could be destroyed by increasing contact with Western countries, so China experienced western trends and tried to stay away from them
 paashchaatya deshon ke sampark main aakar bhi usne apni vesh-bhusha, dharm or reeti-rivaajon ko angikaar kiya
 This was the reason that the Manchu government began to try to remain separate from these western countries openly, keeping in mind that Emperor Kanghasi took out a state communiqué and tried to deprive these castes and missionaries from entering China
 is vijyapti ke peeche samrat kii apni bhaavana to thi hi, saath-hi-saath china kii janata ko bhi santusht karne ke liye use yah vijyapti nikaalani padi
 People of China started hating these foreigners and it was expected that there could be bloodshed in China
 visheshkar videshi mishnariyon se china main kaaphi asantosh tha
 "the feuds between the various missionary orders, the recognition of the emperor's order by some religion-minded people respecting the ancestors, as well as the lack of authority by their officers' representation towards the trend of the new religion, gradually led to misleading ideas
 Opened her eyes to the real character of the preacher
 lekin yah yaad rakhni chahie ki is vijyapti ke anusaar china main aae hue videshiyon ko china se baahar nahin nikaala gaya
 It was said that only a kind of control was placed on them or traders coming from different countries
 china kii manchu sarkaar ko yah ashanka ho gayi thi ki agar in vyapaariyon ko vyapaar karne kii anumati nahin di jaaegi to ve sampoorn china main falkar ashaanti failaane kaa praytn karenge
 Therefore, it was made clear in this release that these foreign traders can trade peacefully from all the coastal ports of China
 vyapaar karne kii anumati milte hi videshiyon kii prasannataa kaa parawar nahin rahaa kyonki bade sahaj dhang se hi unhen yah anumati mil gayi thi
 This encouraged both their enthusiasm and encouragement
 faltah arth-lolupata ke chalate in logon ne nazaij vyapaar bhi karnaa prarambh kiya
 They also began to misuse the trading facilities they had received
 swaabhaavik rup se china kii sarkaar kaa dhyaan punah unki ore aakarshith hua
 That is why the second emperor of Manchu dynasty, Chien Luge, issued a second communique in 1757 AD, due to which foreign trade was limited in China and many kinds of restrictions were imposed on the traders
 is vijyapti ke anusaar in videshi vyapaariyon ko dakshini china ke keval ek bandargah canton se vyapaar karne kii anumati mili
 In addition, a trading party was organized in China called 'co-hung'
 is dal ke paraamarsh tathaa dekh-rekh main hi videshi vyapaaree china se vyapaar kar sakate the
 Thus in the second half of the eighteenth century, the Chinese government kept a sharp eye on the moves of those merchants and made it clear that they could not visit any other port for business matters
 par is vijyapti kaa koi vishesh asar videshi vyapaariyon par nahin padaa
 Along with trade, they began to interfere in the politics of China, and the Christian missionaries began to get worse
 canton se vyapaar karte-karte ve china ke anya bandargahon se bhi vyapaar karne lage
 The Chinese started making their habits bad by consuming opium
 opium khaane kii aadat pad jane se vyapaaree opium kii bikri dwaara aarthik laabh praapt karnaa chaahate the
 When the Chinese government began to see the bad consequences of opium and stopped this trade, then foreign traders started bribing the Chinese officers to join them and this trade continued in secret
 is kaary main england ke angrej atyant patu the
 Due to opium, China began to suffer two types of losses
 ek to opium kii bikri bad jane se angrejon ko phayda hua, lekin china ko aarthik kshati uthaani padi
 Second is that the moral level of the people of China started falling down
 faltah sarkaar ne purna kathorta ke saath opium ke vyapaar par niyantran rakhane kaa prayaas kiya jiske falswaroop china tathaa britain main opium yuddh hua
 China could not succeed in this war because its enemies had a powerful and central government and China's rule was weak and decentralized
 atah in shatruon kaa saamana karne ke liye china shashan kamjor tathaa vikendrit tha
 Therefore China was not ready to face these enemies at all
 ’’ In this way, after many years until the nineteenth century, the relationship of foreigners with China was established
 is sambandh ke parinaam chiniyon ke liye nitant bure hi siddh hue
 It is true that due to these foreigners, the feeling of nationalism came in China, but as long as the pulse of foreigners was wrong, they continued to counter the development of their imperialism in China

 Now only those cases come under the quantitative analysis in which at some point in time one should consider how many methods are there to solve a problem, or how many things can be done
 udhaaharan 1
 - maan len, rail ke ek dibbe kii shayika par chaar asana hai, jinpar nimnlikhit sankhyaayein padi hui hai : Suppose we have passengers a and F, then the question is how can these two passengers be seated on the berth
 spasht he ki pehle yatri k ko ham chaaron main se kisi bhi asana par baitha sakate hai
 Thus, there were four methods of seating A
 maan len, hamane k ko asana sankhya 1 par baitha diya
 Now three postures remain to seat Ch
 at: c ko teenon main se kisi bhi asana par baithaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, there are three methods of seating the a while sitting on one of the seats and there are four types of seating of A
 at: k or c donon ko baitaane kii 4x3, arthath 12 vidhiyaan hui, yaa yon kahie ki k ko baitaane kii vidhiyon or c ko baitaane kii vidhiyon ke 12 sanchay ho sakate hai
 Hence the name of this topic was Accumulative Analysis
 uparyukt vidhiyaan neeche sarini ke rup main darshai gai hai : Example 2 - How many numbers can be formed by taking any two of the three digits, 1, 3, 8,? It is clear that the following numbers will be formed: in sankhyaon kii sankhya 6 he
 Where did this number 6 come from? Example 1
 By reasoning as shown, the answer to the question will be 3x2 ie 6
 is udhaaharan main yah maan liya gaya he ki koi bhi ank dubaara nahin liya jayega, anyathaa teen sankhyaayein 11, 33, 88 or mil jaatin arthath 9 tarie ho jate
 ● How many configurations can be made by taking the objects from different objects? Suppose we have these places ko sa vastuon main se ek ek vastu lekar bharna he
 There are methods to fill the first place, because with any one of these items, we can sit in the said place
 jab ek vastu se ek sthaan bhar gaya, tab duusare sthaan ko bharne ke liye hamaare paas vastuen bachiin
 Therefore, there were methods to fill the second position
 is prakaar pratham donon sthaan bharne kii sa vidhiyaan ho gai
 Similarly, one factor will increase on each step and at the end the following methods of filling the space will be obtained: sa=4, dha=2 rakhane se udhaaharan 1
 kaa uttar =12, aata he
 Similarly, keeping c = 3, d = 2 gives answer 6 to Example 2
 in vinyason kaa 'kramchay' kehete hai or uparyukt fal is prakaar likhaa jaataa he : Now suppose, our question in Example 2
 In how many of the three numbers 1, 3, 8 can we choose two numbers, which means that there will be no consideration of the order of digits in this election
 at: is chunaav main 18 or 81 ko ek duusare se bhinn nahin mana jayega
 It is clear that there will be only three elections: - paribhaashik bhashaa main ham kahenge ki is prakaar ke keval teen sanchay honge
 ● How many accumulations can be made by taking different things from different objects? drushtaant ke liye maan len ki sa=4, dha=3, or vastuon ke sthaan par ham chaar akshar k, c, t, t le len, to spasht he ki in aksharon main se teen lene se, arthath 24, kramchay banenge
 Take any one of these 24 permutations
 k t t, teen aksharon ke is sanchay se ham, arthath 6, kramchay bana sakate hai : Similarly, 6 permutations will be made from each cache
 at: sanchayon kii sankhya= / 6
 Similarly, in the larger illustration, each accumulation will create multiple permutations
 yadi prayek sanchay main dha akshar hai, to ukt sanchay se utane kramchay banenge jitne vinyas dha aksharon ke parsparik herpher se banenge, arthath dha

 Mecca, though to a much greater extent than the Muslims, immediately broke down and fled

 jiske baad mairi ko "lambey kad ke samant" darnle se prem ho gaya
 They got married in Holyrood Palace on 29 July 1565, even when both of them were Catholic and cousins were not allowed to marry
 vivaah ke pashchaat darnle england ke apane ghar se mairi ke paas scotland chale gayi
 But this marriage worried Elizabeth as both Darnley and Mary were descendants of her aunt Margaret and therefore the collective claim of both to the throne of England was more influential and whose children would become strong and prominent contenders for the English throne
 haalanki mairi kaa vivaah ke liye raji hona satta ke liye rajanithik guna-bhaag se zyada darnle ke prati unke aakarshan se zyada prabhavit tha
 British Ambassador Nicholas Throckmorton said that it is being said that Queen Mary is definitely hypnotized and that the marriage can now be prevented only by violence

 zyada samay nahin beetaa tha ki darnle ghamandi hota gaya
 Overcoming his limits as the queen's husband, he sought the matrimonial crown
 aisa hone se vah scotland ke sinhansan kaa sah adhikari ho jaataa or swayan se pehle apni patni yani rani kii mrityu hone par scotland kaa kanoonee raja ho jaataa
 Mary rejected his request and since then their marital relationship has become bitter
 darnle, mairi ke uske nizi catholic secetry david rizzio jise vah mairi ke putr kaa pita bhi samajhataa tha, se acchhee dosti hone se jalataa tha
 By March 1566, Darnley became involved in a secret conspiracy with the Protestant feudatories rebelling against Mary
 9 march ko, shadyantrakariyon ke ek samooh ne darnle ke saath milakar holirud mahal main ek ratribhoj ke dauraan garbhvatee rani ke saamne hi rizzio kaa katl kar diya
 For the next two days, Darnley kept reverberating, and Mary's undead brother, Earl of Moray, arrived at Holyrood
 11–12 march kii raat, darnle or mairi mahal se bhaag gayi or 18 march ko edinburgh lautne se pehle dunbar kile main kuch dinon ke liye sharnaarthi ban gayi
 Mary, son of Mary from Darnley, was born on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh, but Rizzio's murder soured Mary and Darnley's relationship, and their marriage was on the verge of breakdown

 This journey, which was extremely difficult for a woman, was later offered as evidence against her by Mary's enemies to prove her and the Earl of Bothwell to be each other's lovers
 haalaanki us samay kisi ko aisa koi shaq nahin hua tha kyonki mairi apane surakshakarmiyon or salaahkaaron ke saath gayi thim
 Soon after returning to Jedburgh, Marie was struck by a serious illness

 He came to be considered in death

 The cause of his illness was unknown, yet according to the investigation he was due to mental pressure and physical fatigue

 It is not known if Mary was abducted by Bothwell and her soldiers on their way back to Edinburgh on 24 April, either went with them or was forcibly taken to the Dunbar Fort
 6 may ko mairi or bothewel edinburgh laut gayi or 15 may ko unhone holirud mahal yaa holirud aibe main protestant rivaajon se shaadi kar lee
 Bothwell and his first wife Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell, who was the sister of Samantha Huntley, were divorced twelve days earlier
 shuru main mairi ko laga ki bahut saare prabhuddh janon ne uske bothewel ke saath vivaah ko sahi mana he or samarthan kiya he lekin bothewel jo ki ab rani kaa pati ban chukaa tha or uskaa ohada dusron se unchaa ho gaya tha kaa darbar main anya mantriyon or darbariyon ke saath sambandh katu hone lag gaya tha
 This marriage had become extremely unpopular among the people
 catholicon ne shaadi ko gaiyr kanoonee mana kyunki wo bothwel ke talaak or protestant rivaajon se hui shaadi ko vaazib nahin maanate the
 Both Protestants and Catholics were not sure that Mary would marry the murderer of her former husband
 shaadi se mairi kii jindagi main tufaan aa gaya tha or vah behad niraash va hataash ho gayin thim
 26 The courtiers and the feudatories, who were the masters of various cities or princely states in Scotland, turned against Mary and Bothwell and began to form armies against them

 On 18 May, he was arrested by the regional authorities and taken to the Carlisle Palace
 mairi ne sochaa tha ki elizabeth waapas scotland kii satta paane main unki madad karengi
 But Elizabeth was cautious, she set up an inquiry into 26 rebels against Mary and any possibility of Mary being involved in Darnley's death
 july 1568 ke madhya main angrej adhikariyon ne mairi ko scottish seemaa se behad dur bolton ke kile main sthaanantarit kar diya
 Between October 1568 and January 1569, an inquiry team first met in York and later in Westminster
 jabaki scotland main unke samarthak kaarywahi shaasha more va uske uttaradhikariyon ke khilaaf grihayuddh karte rahe
 As a queen, Mary refused to have the power to prosecute her in any court and to make a personal appearance during the trial in York
 mairi ne adaalat main apane pratinidhi bheje lekin elizabeth ne unki upasthiti ko nishedh kar diya
 As evidence against Mary, More showed some perfumes called chests or letters
 —ye wo 8 ahastakshrit sandook kii chiththiyaan thim jinke bare main kaha gaya ki mairi ne bothewel ko bheji hai
 They contained two marriage papers, and a 14-line love poem found in a foot-long silver chest equipped with the seal of a King Francis 2
 mairi ne in chitthiyon se anbhigyata jataai or kaha ki unki lekhnee kaa anusaran kar ke vaisaa hi likhnaa koi mushkil kaam nahi he or chitthiyon par unke hastakshar bhi nahin hai isaliye ye jhuthe hai
 These letters were considered very important because they described feelings of self-immolation over the murder of Mary Darnley
 jaanch dal ke adhyaksh norflock ke duk ne in patron ko behad gambhir or bhayankar or naanaa prakaar ke prempurna geeton vaala mana or elizabeth ko unki pratiyaan yah kahte hue bhijwa deen ki agar ye asli hai to mairi doshi hai
 The authenticity of these letters of the Ark has been the subject of controversy among historians
 ab to inke bare main kuch sabit kar paanaa bhi namumkin he
 These letters written in French were probably destroyed by Mary's son in 1584
 kuch bachi hui pratiyaan jinka angreji main anuwaad he bhi wo bhi purna nahin hai
 Other documents examined were copies of the divorce granted to Gordon of Bothwell, which Morey had ordered from Dunbar
 mairi ke jeevani ke lekhak jaise kii, antonia freizer, ellison veir or jon gaai yah nateeja nikaalte hai ki yaa to ye patr puri tarah se nakli the yaa inamen jaanboojh ke kuch aise anuchhed jode gayi the jo mairi ke khilaaf saboot ban sakate the
 Or these letters were written by some other person to Bothwell or Mary was written to some other person
 gaai kehete hai ki patr kii bhashaa ek duusare se alag si lagati he or french main likhe hue vaakyon or anuchhedon main itani vyakaran kii galtiyaan he jinaki ummid mairi jaisi padhi-likhi or french bhashaa kii jaankaar se nahi kii ja sakati
 However, some sections and epigraphs and some writing styles present in the letters correspond to Mary's style of writing
 sandook ke patron ko 1568 kii sammelan se pehle kabhi jari nahin kiya gaya tha
 However, the Scottish court saw them only in 1567
 mairi ko jabaran apana pad tyaag karne ko kaha gaya or lagbhag ek varsh tak unhen jail main rahanaa padaa
 These letters were never made public to justify the action of sending Mary to jail and denying her the post of queen
 itihaaskaar jeni vormald kaa vishwaas he ki scotishon kaa in chitthiyon ko saarvajanik naa karnaa or 1584 main unhen nasht kar dena is baat kaa sanket he ki inamen mairi ke khilaaf pukhta saboot the jabaki veir sochate hai ki yah ghatnakram darshata he ki scottish samant jo mairi ke virdohi the unhone itnaa samay in chitthiyon ko banane main lagaaya
 However, there are some contemporaries of Mary who saw these letters and believe in the truth of them, such as the Duke of Norfolk, who had a secret plan to marry Mary during the trial, but was told by Elizabeth He refuses this, saying that he does not think of marrying a woman with whom he does not know yet
 jaanchadal ke adhikansh logo ne in chitthiyon kii saamagree ke adhdhayan or unke mairi kii likhaawat se milan ke baad inhen sahi mana
 Elizabeth concluded the investigation as she wished that there was no firm evidence against Mary or her anti-scottish feudatories and nothing was proved
 rajnatik kaarnon se elizabetham mairi ko darnle kii hatya kaa naa hi to doshi or naahi nirdosh maananaa chaahati thim or wo is silsile main nyaayik prakriya ke saath nahin janaa chaahati thim

 Assessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox, who vilified her mercilessly, and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood, who praised, defended and eulogised her
 After the accession of James i in England, historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents
 It condemned Buchanan's work as an invention, and "emphasized Mary's evil fortunes rather than her evil character"
 Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century: William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder, while William Tytler argued the reverse
 In the later half of the twentieth century, the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as " that had characterized older biographies, and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B

 Such accusations rest on assumptions, and Buchanan's biography is today discredited as "almost complete fantasy"

 Several generations of scholarly views on the revolution have given rise to many competing theories and have contributed greatly to developing the current understanding of this complex fact

 ek vyapak he, jiske anusaar kranti he And a narrow one in which jaik goldstone unhen paribhaashit karte hue kehete hai ki Political and social revolutions have been studied under many social sciences, especially under sociology, political science and history
 Leading scholars in the field include Crane Brinton, Charles Brockett, Farideh Farhey, John Foran, John Mason Hart, Samuel Huntington, Jack Goldstone, Jeff Goodwin, Ted Roberts Gurr, Fred Halliday, Chambers Johnson, Tim mc'daniel, Barrington Moore, Geoffrey Page, Wilfredo Peretto, Terence Ranger, Eugene rosenstock-husey, Theda Skouk Paul, James Scott, Eric Selbin, Charles Tilley, Ellen K
 Trimbringer, Carr Los Vistas, or John Walton, Timothy wickham-crowley and Eric Wolf

 First generation scholars such as Gustav Lee Baun, Charles A
 The method of Elwood or Pitirim Sorokin was predominantly descriptive, and the explanations they gave for the fact of revolutions were generally related to social psychology, such as Lee Baun's Crowd Psychology Theory

 He followed cognitive psychology and frustration-aggression theory and saw that the cause of the revolution is the mental state of the general public, while there was a difference of opinion among those about what actually led to the rebellion
 But agreed that the primary cause of the revolution was widespread frustration towards the socio-political state

 As with all psychological ideologies, he differed with regard to the definition of the causes of imbalance, but he agreed that serious imbalance is responsible for the revolution

 hatington, peter amman or arthur el
 stincocombe jaise lekhak shaamil the, ne raajnneeti shaastra ke maarg kaa anusaran kiya or bahuwaadi siddhant va hit samooh sangharsh siddhant par nirbhar rahe
 These theories believe that these incidents are the result of a rights struggle between two competing interest groups
 is prakaar ke pratidarsh main, krantiyaan tab ghatit hoti hai jab do yaa do se adhik samooh saadhaaran nirnayaatmak prakriya main, joki kisi bhi raajnneetik pranali ke liye paaramparik he, sahamat nahin ho pate or saath hi saath unke paas apane lakshya ke anusaran hetu sena niyukti ke liye paryaapt sansaadhan uplabdh hote hai
 Second generation theorists saw that the development of revolutions is a dual process; First, some changes in the present state give results that are different from the results of the past; Second, the new state provides an opportunity for the revolution to occur
 aisi avasthaa main, ek ghatana joki bhootkaal main kranti karwaane ke liye paryaapt nahin thi, vahi ab iske liye paryaapt hoti he- haalanki yadi adhikari aise khataron ke prati sachet rahenge, to is avasthaa main bhi vah virodh ko roak sakate hai 
 Many early studies related to revolutions attempted to focus on four fundamental issues — the well-known and uncontroversial example that is indeed accurate for all definitions of revolutions, such as the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Chinese Revolution
 haalanki, prasidd harvard itihaaskaar, kraine brinton ne apni prasidd pustak "da anatumi of rivolushan" main angreji grihayuddh, america kranti, francisi kranti or roosi kranti par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Over time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolution, and differences in their definitions and methods gave rise to new definitions and explanations
 duusari peedi ke siddhanton kii aalochana unke simit bhugolic prasar, anubhavik satyaapan kii kathinaaiyon or saath hi saath is aadhaar par kii gayi ki haalanki vah kuch vishesh krantiyon kaa spashtikaran detii hai lekin is baat ke liye koi spashtikaran nahin de paati ki inhi paristhitiyon main anya samaajon main vidroh kyun nahin hue
 The second generation of Alochhana led to the creation of a third generation of theories, including Theda Skoukpaul, Barrington Moore, Geoffrey Page and other authors who were expanding their focus on the basis of the ancient Marxist class struggle, focusing their attention on rural agrarian state struggle, State conflicts with upper-class people and domestic political change through inter-state economic and military competition
 o Hne effect and were centered

which is supported and accepted by lower level class based rebellions "and he held the revolutions responsible for various conflicts related to the state, upper class and lower class
 1980 ke dashak ke antim varshon se vidvattapurna kaaryon ke ek nae nikaay ne teesri peedi ke siddhanton kii prabhavakaarita par prashn uthaane shuru kar die
 The old theories were also greatly shocked by the new revolutionary events which could not be expressed easily by them
 1979 main irani or rnikraguan krantiyaan, 1986 main philipinos main janashakti kranti or 1989 main europe main autom of neshans is baat ke gavaah bane ki ahimsak krantiyon main prasidd pradarshan evam jan hadtaal main kai shaktishaalee prathit hone vaale shasno ko bahu varg sanyog ne dhwast kar diya
 It was no longer enough to define revolution or rebellion as a European violent state versus a public or class struggle
 is prakaar krantiyon kaa adhyayan teen dishaao main viksit hua, pehla, kuch anusandhankarta kranti ke pichley yaa adhyatanikrut sanrachanaatmak siddhanton ko un ghatnaon ke sambandh main lagu kar rahe the jo purv main vishleshit nahin thim, adhikanshtah europea sangharsh
