 sadhana theory kii sarpil Elizabeth Newman's spiral analysis of cultivation theory and how interpersonal communication and media work together in the development of public opinion

 He popularizes his opinion that considers when individuals express and then feels that those who remain silent when it occurs
 ek mudde ke ek taraf zyada prachaar or thodaa ke saath duusare paksh ke saath samaapt hota he to yah he ki is prakriya ko ek sarpil main hota he
 This expression / non-expression rests on two premises

 These perceptions of other people accommodate their expression of opinion

 Threats of criticism are also powerful forces in silencing individuals

 Design and placement of corporate communication function kendrikaran yaa vikendrikaran kii jarurat aamtaur par company ke aakaar, utpaada yaa seva vividhta, or bhugolic vistaar ke vichaar vajan karne ke liye neeche aata he
 For a company as diverse and large as General Electric, for example, the question was controversial
 airospes or televijan network ke rup main ke rup main vibhinn gatividhiyon main shaamil is tarah ke ek vishaal, vividh sanghathan sambhawatah apane sanchaar gatividhiyon ke sabhi main puri tarah kendrikrut nahin rah sakate hai
 Perhaps then, the good structure for large companies is a combination of a network of decentralized operatives helping to keep a consistent, centralized, functional area plus function suited to the particular needs of the independent business unit, while keeping constant communication throughout the organization
 apane phaayde ke baavjood, kendrikrut or vikendrikrut gatividhiyon kaa mishran reporting sambandhon ke sandarbh main sanghathanon ke liye samasyaayein prastut karata he
 When managers from the communications operatives headquarters do not agree with the action taken locally, they report to their local managers as, inevitably, they will run into problems
 ve mukhyalay ko report karata he, to duusari ore, gurgon sthaneey str par sanghathan ke aaraam ke saath main feet nahin ho saktaa he
 These problems often back on General Electric, as in the case of acting as "journalists", a strong centralized control for all matters relating to communications through out the company and the involvement of both local operatives
 The use of some combination can be handled constructively
 vyavsaayik ikaayiyon ke paar vikendrikaran banaam kendrikaran kii samasya company ke aakaar, bhugolic failaav, or company ke utpaadon or sevaaon kii vividhta ke aadhaar par kam yaa zyada mahatvapurn ho jayega Multi party negotiation bahudaleey vaarta se adhik do pakshon ke ek samuhik uddeshy tak pahunchane ke liye ek saath kaam kar rahe hai, jahaan main baatcheet kii prakriya he
 In the process of multi-party negotiations, each party has its own preferences and priorities
 isliye, ek baithak ke har vyakti ke liye sabase acha vikalp ke bare main charchaa karne ke liye or ek samuhik nirnay karne ke liye aavashyak he
 It is a multi-party dialogue that involves unique dynamics in a collective decision making process
 haalanki, is prakriya kaa prabandhan karne ke liye itnaa aasaan nahin he
 There are factors that make multi-party negotiations more difficult to manage than one-on-one negotiations
 sab se pehle, partiyon kii sankhya baatcheet bada ho gaya he or kai alag alag drushtikon ke prabandhan ke liye chunautiyaan paidaa kar detaa he
 It is difficult to ensure that each party has enough time to speak its own preference and be heard
 duusare, soochna or computesnal jatilta adhik muddon, muddon par adhik drushtikon, or adhik kul jaankaree main laata he
 Increasing the number of parties negotiated status less luminous, and demanding more
 ek nirnay lene main shaamil kai logon ko bhi saamaajik jatilta paidaa karte hai
 The social environment will change from one-on-one dialogue to a small group discussion
 natijatan, chote samoohon ke sabhi gatishiltaa vaartakaron vyavhaar karte hai jis tarah se prabhavit he, or bhaag lene ke liye shuru karte hai
 In addition, when more parties are involved in a conversation, the process has to follow the individual and is more complex
 dalon muddon ko prastut karne ke liye lanbaa samay lagegaa or yah baatcheet uddeshy tak pahunchane ke liye samay letaa he
 Parties may have to negotiate a new process that allows them to more effectively coordinate their actions
 baatcheet kii kala The most difficult thing to achieve a business goal is that in the world, there is probably nothing but a negotiating table
 ek baatcheet ke jariye samjhaute tak pahunchne or duusare paksh par jeet hamaare bazaar hameshaa ke liye prayaas karte hai, jiske liye sabase jatil or jatil kaam he
 From management science to business calculus to psychology, from politics to diplomacy as well as socialism, negations include and encompass every art
 vaarta logon ko hi upar ullekh vishyon main se ek main nahin phir se shuru kiye jane kii jarurat he, lekin ve jarurat padane par, sabhi upkaran ko rojgaar ke liye maharath hona chahie
 The art of interacting with the rapidly changing world of business and economics is also becoming more and more volatile and evaporative
 ek kaa saamana yaa samay kii nishchit avadhi lekin isamen shaamil party ke kisi bhi ek asantusht mahasoos karata he jab kisi bhi samay paidaa hui kiya ja saktaa phir se baatcheet karne kii jarurat ke liye rahane ke liye baatcheet kii bastiyon lagata nahin kar sakate hai
 One cannot simply rely on business realities while sitting at the discussion table, a comparative study cannot think or factual interpretation can lead to desired results

 So few companies do that, except those that practice this art, and stand out from the crowd, it does well bijness report lekhanreport lekhan lagbhag har kshetra main peshewaron ke liye ek aavashyak kaushal he
 Each kind of report has its own characteristics
 ek jaanch report yaa ek surveykshan report anivaary rup se ek tathy khojane report he or spasht rup se tathyon ko baahar laana chahie
 a directors' report, on the other hand, details the development or progress related to the business organization during a particular period
 ek samiti kii report keval tathyon or aankadon ke baahar laane ke liye, lekin yah bhi sadasyon or antim siforishein dwaara vyakt kii vaikalpik drushtikon cover nahin kar sakate
 Notwithstanding these specific features of reports, there are some essential features of writing a good business report: 1
 Issue in perspective: The first essential for any good report is to emphasize the pros and cons to bring out the issue in its proper perspective Are for yah ek pragati report karen; ek surveykshan report, ek vishleshnatmak report yaa ek jaanch report, vishay ek nishpaksh or vastunishth dhang se prastut kiya janaa chahie
 Both the positive and negative aspects of the study issues should be included in the report
 2
 aadhikarik tathy or aankade: report lekhak tathyon or report main uddhrut aankade pramanik or vishwasaneey hai ki yah sunishchit karnaa chahie
 The data cited in the report are likely to be used by many other individuals and agencies

 satraa varsh kii avasthaa main mehrunnisa kaa vivaah 'alikuli' naamak ek saahsee irani navayuvak se hua tha, jise jahangir ke rajya kaal ke prarambh main sher afakhaan kii oopaadhi or bardwan kii jaagir di gai thi
 In 1607 AD Jahangir's messengers killed Sher Afghan in a battle
 mehrunnisa ko pakad kar dilli laayaa gaya or use badshaah ke shahi haram main bhej diya gaya
 Here she became the hostess of Queen 'salima Begum', the widow of Emperor Akbar
 mehrunnisa ko jahangir ne sarvapratham nauroz tyohaar ke avasar par dekha or uske soundarya par mugdh hokar jahangir ne may, 1611 i
 main usase vivaah kar liya
 After marriage, Jahangir conferred upon him the titles of 'nurmahal' and 'nur Jahan'
 1613 i
 main noorjehan ko ‘pattamahishi’ yaa ‘badshaah begum’ banaaya gay Apart from being an extraordinary beauty, Nur Jahan was also intelligent, modesty and prudent
 uski sahitya, kavita or lalit kalaon main vishesh ruchi thi
 His target distinction was infallible
 1619 i
 main usne ek hi goli se sher ko maar giraaya tha
 Because of all these qualities she had established complete dominion over her husband

 Her name also began to be dug on the coins and she started to court in the palace itself
 uske pita etmaduddola or bhai aasaf khaan ko mogul darbar main ucch pad pradaan kiya gaya tha or uski bhatiji kaa vivaah, jo aage chalakar mumtaz ke naam se prasiddh hui, shahjahan se ho gaya
 She married her daughter, born to the first husband, to Jahangir's youngest son Shaharyar, and because she had no children from Jahangir, she wanted Shaharyar to sit on the throne after Jahangir
 noorjehan ke ye sabhi kaary uski kootneeti kaa hi ek hissaa the
 By the end of 1620 AD, Nur Jahan's relations with Khurram were not good, because by now Nur Jahan had realized that his influence on the affairs of the government would be reduced when Shah Jahan became king
 isliye noorjehan ne jahangir ke duusare putr ‘shehryaar’ ko mahatv dena prarambh kar kiya
 Since Shaharyar was of short age and weak character, Nur Jahan's influence on his becoming emperor would have continued in the works of governance as before
 is kaaran se sher afakhaan se utpann apni putree 'ladli begum' kii shaadi 1620 i
 main shehryaar se kar use 8000 / 4000 kaa mansab pradaan kiya
 When Shah Jahan realized that Nur Jahan wanted to reduce his influence, he revolted in the Deccan in 1623, disobeying Jahangir's order to invade Kandahar fort and win it
 
 uske vidroh ko dabaane ke liye noorjehan ne aasaf khaan ko na bhej kar mahavat khaan ko shahzada parvaiz ke netritv main bheja
 Both of them successfully crushed Shah Jahan's rebellion
 shahjahan ne pita jahangir ke samaksh atsamarpan kar diya or use kshamaa mil gai
 As a surety, two sons of Shah Jahan, Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb, were kept in the court as hostages
 1625 i
 tak shahjahan kaa vidroh purnatah shant ho gaya
 Nur Jahan got jealous of Mahavat Khan who played an important role in suppressing Shah Jahan's rebellion
 noorjehan ko iskaa ahsaas tha, ki mahavat khaan un logon main se he, jinhen shashan ke kaaryon main meraa prabhutv sweekaar nahin he
 Nur Jahan was also threatened by the proximity of Mahavat Khan and Shahzada Parvez
 atah uske prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye noorjehan ne use bengal jane evam yuddh ke samay luute gayi dhan kaa hisaab dene ko kaha
 Apart from these reasons, there were other reasons as well, due to which, feeling insulted, Mahavat Khan revolted and captured Emperor Jahangir going to Kabul on the banks of river Jhelum in 1626 AD
 noorjehan evam uske bhai aasaf khaan ko bhi bandi bana liya
 Even in prison, Mahavat Khan did not think of loyalty and respect for Jahangir
 rohtas main noorjehan evam jahangir ne kootneeti ke dwaara apane ko mahavat khaan ke prabhaav se mukt kar liya
 Mahavat Khan ran towards 'thatta' for his protection
 28 oktober, 1626 ko parvej kii mrityu ke baad ek tarah se mahavat khaan kamazor ho gaya or vah shahjahan kii seva main chalaa gaya
 During Jahangir's life, Nur Jahan was omnipotent, but after Jahangir's death in 1627, his political sovereignty was destroyed

 He spent the rest of his life in Lahore till his death

 The contents of Wikipedia are subject to legislation in Florida, where Wikipedia's servers are hosted, and many editorial policies and guidelines emphasize that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
 vikipedia main prayek pravishti ek vishay ke bare main honi chahie jo vishwakosh se sambandhit he or is prakaar se shaamil kiye jane ke yogya he
 a subject can be understood to be related to the encyclopedia if it is "notable" in Wikipedia's jargon, that is, if it has acquired significant coverage in secondary reliable sources that are independent of the subject matter

 The open nature of the editing model has remained central to most critics of Wikipedia
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi bhi avasar par, ek lekh kaa pathak yah sunishchit nahin kar saktaa ki jis lekh ko vah pard rahaa he usamen vidhwans pravriti shaamil he yaa nahin
 Critics argue that non-expert editing reduces quality

 Considered to be the property of those who know Urdu, the world of Nawabs and Raktasas, and the credit of shifting ital ghazals to the common man on the shrieks of the poets, if one is to be given first, it is Jagjit Singh The name comes on Zuban
 unki gazalon ne na sirf urdu ke kam jaankaron ke bich shero-shaayari kii samaj main izaafaa kiya balki gaalib, mir, majaaz, josh or firaaq jaise shaayaron se bhi unka parichay karaayaa
 Jagjit Singh was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the field of art by the Government of India in 2003
 farvari 2014 main aapke sammaan va smriti main do dak tikat bhi jari kiye gaye
 Jagjit ji was born on 8 February 1941 on 10 October 2011 in Ganganagar, Rajasthan
 pita sardaar amar singh dhamani bharat sarkaar ke karmchaaree the
 Jagjit ji's family is originally from Dalla village in Ropar district of Punjab

 Jagjeet's childhood name was Jeet
 karodon sunne waalon ke chalate singh sahab kuch hi dashakon main jag ko jeetne vaale jagajeet ban gaye
 Initial education took place at the Khalsa School in Ganganagar and later came to Jalandhar to study
 diavi college se snaatak kii degree lee or iske baad kurushetra vishvavidhyalay se itihaas main post grajuation bhi kiya
 Like many, Jagjit ji's first love also could not be overcome
 apane un dinon kii yaad karte hue ve kehete hai, ”ek ladki ko chaha tha
 During his studies in Jalandhar, he had to go on a cycle
 ladki ke ghar ke saamne cycle kii chaiyn tuutane yaa hawa nikaalane kaa bahaanaa kar baith jate or use dekha karte the
 Later this trend continued with the bike
 padhai main dilchaspee nahin thi
 In some classes, i spent two or two years
 In Jalandhar itself, during the days of DAV college, girls used to go around a lot
 ek baar apni chacheri bahan kii shaadi main jami mahila mandali kii baithak main jaakar geet gane lage the
 On being asked, it is said that if there were no singers, they would have been a washerman
 pita ke ijazat ke bagair filmein dekhnaa or takies main get keeper ko ghuns dekar haul main ghusna aadat thi
 Music inherited from his father in childhood
 ganganagar main hi pandit chagan laal sharma ke sanidhya main do saal tak shastreey sangeet seekhney kii shuruuaat kii
 Later, he learned the nuances of Khyal, Thumri and Dhrupad from Ustad Jamal Khan Sahab of Sania Gharana
 pita kii khwaahish thi ki unka betaa bhartiya prashasnic seva main jaae lekin jagajeet par gayak banane kii dhun savaar thi
 Vice Chancellor Professor Surajbhan greatly encouraged Jagjit Singh ji when he saw his interest in music while studying at Kurukshetra University
 unke hi kehane par ve 1965 main mumbai aa gaye
 a period of struggle started from here
 ve peing guest ke taur par rahaa karte the or vigyapanon ke liye jingles gaakar yaa shaadi-samaaroh vagairah main gaakar rozi roti kaa jugad karte rahe
 In 1967, Jagjit ji met Chitra ji
 do saal baad donon 1969 main parinay sutara main bandha gaye
 Jagjit Singh brought the dream of playback singing to the film world
 tab pet paalane ke liye college or oonche logon kii partiyon main apni peshkash diya karte the
 In those days songs of Talat Mehmood and Mohammad Rafi Saheb were popular among people
 rafi-kishor-mannade jaise mahaarathiyon ke daur main parshv gayan kaa mauqaa milanaa bahut dur tha
 Jagjit ji recalls, “in the days of struggle, i used to sing different songs to please the college boys because boys used to hoot on classical songs
 ” tab kii mashhoor music company ech em ve ko lite clasical trend par tike sangeet kii darkaar thi
 Jagjit ji did the same and the first album 'the Unforgetables' was a hit
 jagajeet ji un dinon ko yaad karte hue kehete hai, ”un dinon kisi singer ko el pi milanaa bahut fakhr kii baat hua karti thi
 "very few people know that Sardar Jagjit Singh Dhiman had become Jagjit Singh before the release of this album
 bal kataakar asardaar jagajeet singh banane kii raah pakad chuke the
 Jagjit bought the first flat in Mumbai after the success of this album
 jagajeet singh ne gazalon ko jab filmi gaanon kii tarah gaanaa shuru kiya to aam aadmi ne ghazal main dilchaspee dikhaani shuru kii lekin ghazal ke jaankaron kii bhauhen tedi ho gai
 Especially in the world of Ghazal, which was of the likes of Mayar Begum Akhtar, Kundanlal Sehgal, Talat Mehmood, Mehdi Hasan
 
 Apart from that, Jagjit Singh's style did not appeal to purists
 darasal yah vah daur tha jab aam aadmi ne jagajeet singh, pankaj udhaas sareekhe gayakon ko sunakar hi ghazal main dil lagaana shuru kiya tha
 On the other hand, the use of new singers was piercing the fans of traditional singing from classicalism
 aarope lagaaya gaya ki jagajeet singh ne ghazal kii porti or mood ke saath chhedhkhani kii
 But Jagjit Singh has always said in his cleanliness that he has made some changes in the presentation but has done very little tampering with words
 beshtar mauqon par ghazal ke kuch baari-bharkam sheron ko hataakar ise chah se saat minute tak samet liya or sangeet main dabl baas, guitar, piaano kaa chalan shuru kiya
 It should also be noted that in the use of modern and western instruments traditional instruments like sarangi, tabla are not left behind
 prayogon kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin rukaa balki table ke saath octoped, saarangi kii jagah vaayalin or hormonium kii jagah keyboard ne bhi lee
 Jagjit ji made a unique experiment in Kahakshan and Face to Face collections
 donon elbum kii kuch gazalon main kores kaa istemaal hua
 Vinod Khanna made a wonderful use of the guitar in the song 'jag Ke Kati Saree Raina' from the movie 'leela' starring Dimple Kapadia
 jalaal aagaa nirdeshit tivi serial kehkashan ke is elbum main majaaz lakhanvi kii ‘aawaara’ nazm ‘i game dil kya karun i vahshate dil kya karun’ or fes tu fes main ‘dairo-haram main rahane waalon maykhaaron main foot na daalo’ behtareen prastuti thim
 Jagjit was the first Ghazal Gulukar to release 'beyond Time' album while doing digital recordings for the first time in London with Chitra Ji
 itnaa hi nahin, jagajeet ji ne clasiki shaayari ke alaava saadhaaran shabdon main dhali aam-aadmi kii jindagi ko bhi sur die
 Compositions like 'now i look at the ration shops', 'I cried in pardes me', 'maa sunao mujhe woh kahani' also attracted those who do not listen to ghazals
 shaayar nida fazli, bashir badr, gulzaar, javed akhtar jagajeet singh ji ke pasandida shaayaron main hai
 Nida has done Fazli's couple of albums 'insight'
 javed akhtar ke saath ‘silsile’ zabardast kaamyaab rahaa
 'sajda' with Lata Mangeshkar ji, 'marasim' with Gulzar and 'koi Baat Chale', Kahakaan, Sound Affair, Different Strokes and Mirza Ghalib are important
 karodon logon ko divaana banane vaale jagajeet singh ne mero-gaalib se lekar faij-firaaq tak or gulzaar-nida fajali se lekar rajesh reddy or alok shrivastav tak har daur ke shaayar kii gazalon ko apni awaz di
 Who can forget 'premgeet' directed by Raman Kumar in 1981 and 'earth' directed by Mahesh Bhatt in 1982
 ‘arth’ main jagajeet ji ne hi sangeet diya tha
 Every song of the film was spoken by the people
 iske baad filmon main hit sangeet dene ke saare prayaas buree tarah naakaamayaab rahe
 a few years ago, the film Leela, starring Dimple Kapadia and Vinod Khanna, had average music
 1994 main khudaai, 1989 main billus badshaah, 1989 main kaanoon kii awaz, 1987 main raahi, 1986 main jwaala, 1986 main laung da lashkaara, 1984 main ravan or 1982 main sitam ke geet chale or na hi filmein
 All these films were considered below average in those days
 zaahir he ki jagajeet singh ne bataur compozar bahut papad bele lekin ve achche filmi gane rachane main asafal hi rahe
 In contrast, playback singer Jagjit ji has always been accumulating listeners
 unki sahraana awaz dil kii gaharaaiyon main aise utarati rahi maano gane or sunne vaale donon ke dil ek ho gaye hon
 Here are some hit film songs- ‘premugit’ kaa ‘hothon se chhu lo tum meraa geet amar kar do’ ‘khalanaayak’ kaa ‘o maa tuje salaam’ ‘dushman’ kaa ‘chitthee naa koi sandesh’ ‘jogars park’ kaa ‘badi najuk he ye manzil’ ‘saath-saath’ kaa ‘ye tera ghar, ye meraa ghar’ or ‘pyaar mujhase jo kiya tumne’ ‘sarfarosh’ kaa ‘hoshwalon ko khabar kya bekudi kya chiz he’ ‘trekkic signal’ kaa ‘haath chhute bhi to rishte nahin chuta karte’ ‘tum bin’ kaa ‘koi faryaad tere dil main dabi ho jaise’ ‘vir zaaraa’ kaa ‘tum paas aa rahe ho’ ‘tarqeeb’ kaa ‘meri ankhon ne chunaa he tujko duniya dekhakar’ Very few people will know that Jagjit Singh was so shattered during his struggle days that he even made sharp comments on the established playback singers
 haalanki aaj ve ise apni bhul sweekaarte hai
 Stettman writes that, Kishore Da commented on Jagjit Singh's statement - "how dare these so-called ghazal singers criticize an icon that Manna Dey, Mukesh and i dare not criticize
" Rafi was unique
 " Apparently, what Jagjit Ji said on the great playback singer Mohammad Rafi Sahab would not be appropriate
 ye bhi dekhne vaali baat he ki jagajeet ji ne apni pasand ke jin filmi gaanon kaa cover varsan elbum chlose tu maai heart main kiya tha
 
 usamen rafi sahab kaa koi gaanaa nahin tha
 Well, after this, his interest in politics also increased and during the indo-pak Kargil war he objected to the crowd of singers coming from Pakistan
 tab jagajeet singh ji kaa kahana tha ki unke aane par bain laga dena chahie
 Actually, Pakistan refused to grant a visa to Jagjit ji
 
 But when the call came from Pakistan, then Jagjit Singh ji's resentment was dispelled
 ye is shaks kii bhalmansahat thi ki jagajeet ne gazalon ke shahenshaah mehadi hasan ke ilaaj ke liye teen lakh rupye kii madad kii
 
 un dinon mehadi hasan sahab ko pakistan kii sarkaar tak ne nazarandaaz kar rakhaa tha
 Hobby of horse racing- Jagjit ji's second pastime famous in the gentle manners like Ghazal singing is horse racing in the race course
 cancert ke baad kahin sukun miltaa he to wo he mumbai mahalakshmi ilaake kaa rescorse
 In 1965, there were some people in the sher-e-punjab hotel where they had camped in Mumbai, who were fond of horse racing

 But by the time he was ousted from power, his image had completely changed
 pakistan kaa ek bada tabaka unhen bhrashtachar or kushasan ke pratik ke rup main dekhne laga
 According to many analysts, Zardari was responsible for Benazir's downfall, who also had to undergo a jail sentence on corruption charges

 He was killed when he was going out after the rally to end, leaving his car's sunroof out and leaving the supporters
 unki maut se pakistan main loktantr kii bahaali par prashnchinh lag gaya he
 The assassination of Benazir was also disputed
 sabase pehle ye mana gaya ki bam visfot ke kaaran unki hatya hui
 The Pakistani government later came to the statement that Benazir was killed neither by a gunman nor by the intensity of the explosion
 balki, pakistani sarkari bayanon ke mutabik unki mrityu visphot se bachane ke liye teji se sanroof se takaraane se hui
 He strongly opposed the official statement of his party's supporters on this matter
 unka kahana tha ki benazir kii hatya chharre lagane se hui thi
 a video released by the Times of India showed that someone shot his life, four shots before the explosion
 virodh ke baad pakistan sarkaar ne kaha ki sarkaar unki laash ko postmortem ke liye phir se baahar nikaalane ke liye taiyaar he
 But her husband Asif Ali Zardari urged the government not to do so
 is hatya kii jimmevary al qaayada ke mustafaa abu al yazid ne lee he
 The reason for this is attributed to Benazir Bhutto's pro-american image in Pakistan and his being a corrupt leader who was considered a supporter of Pervez Musharraf and people believed that he would support Musharraf after the election

 Herbert George Wells - in vogue from ACHG Wales - was a versatile author of English proficient in many genres, including novels, history, politics, social commentary, textbooks, and rules of war games

 His most notable fictional science writing works include 'the Time Machine', 'the Island of Doctor Morio', 'the Invisible Man' and 'the War of the Worlds'
 unka naam sahitya ke nobel puraskaar ke liye chaar baar namankit kiya gaya tha
 Wells's initial specialized training was in biology, and his views on ethical subjects were specific and organized in the Darwinian context
 ve shuruaati dinon se ek spashtvaadi samaajawaadee bhi the, jo aksar shantivaadee vichaaron kaa samarthan karaten
 His later writing assignments became progressively political and instructive, and he wrote little in the fictional science genre, and during this time he also made it clear in formal letters several times that his occupation was that of a journalist

 vayugatiki gativigyaan kii vah shakha he jisamen vaayu tathaa anya gasiy taralon kii gati kaa or in taralon ke saapeksh gativan thoson par lage balon kaa vivechan hota he
 One of the most important applications of this science is the design of airplanes
 sabhi gaison main shyanta or sampidyata, do gun newnaadhik maatra main hote hai
 The third multiplication is homogeneity
 yadhyapi vaayu vivikt anuon se bani hoti he, ise santat madhyam athwa saantatyak maan lene main truti tab tak upekshiyaneey rahati he, jab tak vah atyadhik viral na ho
 Theoretical treatment is often impossible without assuming a theory
 shyaantahin, arthath gharshanhin, asampidya tathaa samang taral ko paripurna taral kehete hai
 Both water and air can be considered perfect liquids
 kam vegavaale vayupravah ke vayugativigyaan ke ganitiya siddhant praaia: dravgati vigyaan jaise hai
 The solution to the problems of aerodynamics is found by adding the extra viscosity to the solution obtained on the recognition of the perfect liquid
 shyaan taralon ke vayugativigyaan main sarvaadhik mahattawala siddhant parisima str siddhant he, jiske aadhaar par vaayu main gatiman pind main tvak-gharshan-karsh kii vyakhya di jaati he
 When the velocity of a moving body in air is close to, or even exceeds, the velocity of sound, the effect of changes in density and temperature becomes important in the interpretation of pressures acting on the body
 tab taral ko asampidya nahin mana ja saktaa or daab, ghanatv tathaa taap ke parsparik sambandh kaa gyaat hona aavashyak he
 The practical application of aerodynamics of compressive flow is in the external interpolation of projections and in the flight-technology of high-speed aircraft or propellants
 iskaa upyog shakti-sanyantr kii dizine main, vaashp tarabine tathaa gas tarabine or jet-nodan ekakonvaale pravaah ke adhyayan main kiya gaya he
 The ratio of Pindweg and terrestrial soundweg is called make number
 chunki kisi taral main dhwaniveg taralaghnatv ke saapeksh daab parivartan dar kii maap he, mek sankhya m taral kii sampidyata kaa suchak he
 It can be proved that if M> 1, that is, the area between the tund, duct, or stream lines in the transcendental current, should increase with acceleration
 iske vipareet sthiti avadhvanik pravaah ke liye he
 Such motion of a liquid, in which the velocity and direction do not change with time, is called the steady flow, otherwise it is called variable flow
 dolyman pakshak athwa sthir kund pind ke pechhevaala pravaah parivarti hota he
 Most of the problems dealt with in aerodynamics are irreversible flow
 pravaah ko ekavim, dwivim yaa trivim is baat ke anusaar kehete hai ki usamen veg, ghanatv or daab keval ek, do yaa teen akashacharon ke falan hai
 The design of wind tunnel is the application of a Vim flow principle
 dwivim arthath samtal pravaah main gati rekhaayen, arthath dhara rekhaayen, yaa to ek hi samtal main hongi yaa samaantar samatalon main hongi or tab in samatalon main gati tatsam hogi
 The flow from the sides with infinite expansion is two-dimensional, as the corresponding flow will be found at the transverse sections of the sides
 yadi pakshak simit vistaar kaa ho, to trivim pravaah praapt hota he
 When the velocity is so low that air can be considered as compressible like fluid, the flow is called incompressible flow
 veg kii drushti se pravaah ko avadhvanik, transdhvanik, paradhvanik, yaa atidhvanik, is tathy ke anusaar kehete hai ki pravahveg dhwaniveg se kam, uske nikat, usase adhik, yaa usase kahin adhik he
 The velocity of the body pressure signals is obtained from the soundwave, by decreasing its velocity relative to the forward body, or by adding its velocity relative to the posterior body
 kalantar pind ke saapeksh uske veg ko jod dene par, praapt hota he
 In time, the signals reach all the points of the sky
 atyant nune avadhvanik vegon par dabasanketon kaa sancharan sabhi dishaao main samamit hota he or yadi dabasanketon kaa veg anant mana ja sake, to avadhvanik pravaah asampidya pravaah jaisaa ho jaataa he
 In supersonic flow the pressure signals are unable to move forward and the disturbance at a particular point is confined within the "make" cone in the downstream direction
 jaisaa ki karmaa ne siddh kiya he, atidhvanik pravaah kaa vayugati-vigyaan kai baton main newton ke kanikawaad se mail khaataa he
 The development of rocket flight inspired the study of supersonic flow
 is adhyayan main shankaviya pravaah ke, jisamen ek mul bindugami trigyon ke anudish taral gun aparivartit rahete hai, anekon anuprayog hai
 The aerodynamics of extremely sparse gases has been termed as atomology, because the gas's free path is no longer negligible compared to the expansion of the body
 vayugativigyaan sambandhi ghatnaon ko ganitiya praturup dwaara nirupit karne kaa pehla dhyey yah jaananaa hota he ki pind par daab kis prakaar vitarit he or uske kaaran vayuyan ke bahya or aantarik prishthon par kya parinami bal or ghurna kriyavant hai, jisase unhen samuchit dridhtaa kaa banaaya ja sake
 Secondly, to find the type of airflow on one part of the aircraft, so that its effect can be studied on other organs like the tail
 vaayu jaise alp-shyaan taral ke gatisameekaran ban to jate hai, kintu saamanyatya ve hal nahin ho pate
 Therefore results are obtained by experimenting in aeronautics; But experimenting on whole-scale objects is extremely expensive and laborious
 pidon ke chote pratirupon ko baat surang main latakaakar, samuchit vayupravah main unki pratikriya dekhi jaati he
 Air can be considered perfect in aeronautical problems
 us sthiti main yah ganitsiddh tathy he ki pind kaa pariman, athwa uskaa veg, yaa taral kaa ghanatv kuch bhi ho, samroopat: gativan samroop pindon se samroop vayupravahon kaa janan hoga
 The same is true for liquid liquid
 yadi 400 mile prati ghante se bade vegon kaa saamana ho, to samarupata ke liye yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki jalawaale prayogon main vegon kaa jaleey dhwaniveg se vahi anupaat rahe jo vayuvale prayogon main vaayu kaa dhwaniveg se he, arthath jalawaale veg vaayu waalon ke lagbhag chaugune hon
 The symmetry in viscosity-affected fluid flows requires that the renold number of both, pvl m, remain the same
 yahan m taral kii shyanta, r uskaa ghanatv, v us main hokar pind kaa veg or 1 us pind kaa pariman paribhaashit karanevaali koi samuchit lambaai he, jaise vayuyan ke liye uski lambaai or gole ke liye uskaa vyas
 If the renold number of a flow is small, that speed will have a significant effect on viscosity and will give a flow like sire, or heavy oil
 pariklpit ashyaan taral ke siddhant kaa ek nishkarsh yah he ki yadi koi pind aise taral main chalata he jo keval pind ke kaaran hi viramavastha ko chode hue he, to pind ke parit: pravaahprakaar adwitiya rup se pind ke aakaar or uski gati se nirdhaarit ho jaataa he or pindprishth ke vibhinn binduon par taral jo dabaav lagaataa he, unka parinami shunya hota hai, bhale hi unka aghurna shunya na ho
 This condition is available on a plane lobe such as a flat flow body
 jo bhi thodaa-bahut karsh rahata he, vah keval tvakgharshan, arthath prishth par vayugharshanjanit sparsharekhiy balon, ke kaaran hota he
 Flows with large renold numbers are confined in a very thin layer adjoining the acceleration body, called the boundary layer
 is str ke bheetar kaa pravaah atyant jatil he
 The flow out of the stratum is like a sharp liquid
 jab tak pakshak kaa veg se apaat kone atyadhik na ho, pakshak ke parit: pravaah dhararekhi hoga, karsh kam hoga or pakshak par utthapak bal lagayegaa, jo apaat kone ke saath badhegaa
 If the emergency angle is increased over a range, the flow becomes distorted without a streamline and the sides begin to become disordered; The year is completely gone and the lifting force starts decreasing as the emergency angle increases
 kam apaat kone kii avasthaa main bhi balon kaa saidhantik vivechan jatil he; visheshkar parimit pariman ke pakshak main prerit karsh, parshv karsh aadi, par vichaar karnaa hota he
 The problem of stability in free flight is also present

 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times
 7ve shatabdi main pehali baar jab logo ne punjab praant main ito ke liye mitti kii khudaai kii tab unhen vahaan se bani banaai ite mili jise logo ne bhagwaan kaa chamatkaar mana or unka upyog ghar banane main kiya uske baad1826 main charles mysen ne pehali baar is puraani sabhyataa ko khoja
 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress
 uttar hadappa avasthaa gujarat ke kathiyawad prayadweep main rangpur or rosedi sthalon par bhi pai gai he
 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign
 hadappa yonto ek krishi pradhan samskruti thi par yahaan ke log pashupaalan bhi karte the
 Bull-cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and boar were reared
 harappai logon ko hathi tathaa gande kaa gyaan tha
 Many businesses were prevalent in the cities here
 mitti ke bartan banane main ye log bahut kushal the
 Different types of paintings were made on pottery with black color
 kapadaa banane kaa vyavsaay unnat avasthaa main tha
 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces
 ye afghanistan or iran se vyapaar karte the
 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the

 Mudra constructing, making seven utensils of sculpture was also a major craft
 pracheen mesopotamia kii tarah yahaan ke logon ne bhi lekhan kala kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 The first specimen of the Harappan script was found in 1853 AD and the entire script came to light in 1923 but has not been read yet

 Scholars do not agree on the reasons for its destruction
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke avsaan ke peeche vibhinn tark diye jate hai jaise: akraman, jalwaayu parivartan evam paristhitik asantulan, barh tathaa bhu-tathvik parivartan, mahamari, aarthik kaaran
 It seems that there was not a single reason for the decline of this civilization, but because of a combination of different reasons
