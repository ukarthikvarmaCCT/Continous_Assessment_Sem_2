 The Bharatiya Janata Party formed a government that lasted for some time

 At the beginning of the 19th century Lamarck gave his theory of evolutionism, which was the first fully formed scientific theory related to evolution
 sanganak sanchika ekatrit jaankaree kaa ek varg he, yaa jaankaree ko sanchit karne ke liye ek sansaadhan he jo ki kisi sanganak kaarykram ko uplabdh hota he or aamtaur par yah kisi prakaar kii tikaoo sanganak bhandaaran par aadhaarit hota he
 The file is durable in that it exists for use by other programs even after the current program has finished
 sanganak sanchikaon ko paaramparik rup se daphtaron or pustakaalayon ke filon main maujuud kagaz ke dastavezon kaa aadhunik rup mana ja saktaa he, isiilie angrezi main iskaa naam fil padaa he
 At the lowest level, many modern operating systems consider files to be only a series of one-dimensional bytes
 adhik ucch str par, jab sanchika kii saamagree ko bhi maddenzar rakhaa ja rahaa ho, to ye dwilvie ank purna, akshar, chhavi pixel, dhwani yaa kisi or chiz kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue maane ja sakate hai
 It is up to the program to use the file how it interprets the file and understand the internal settings of the information so that it can present the same information in a more meaningful style to the user
 kisi bhi samay par sanchika kaa ek aakaar hoga, aamtaur par yah biton main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he or yah darshata he ki is sanchika ne bhandar main kitni jagah gheri hui he
 In most modern operating systems this size can be any nonnegative integer, but will have a maximum limit according to the system
 lekin sanchika kii saadhaaran paribhaasha yah lazimi nahin tehraati he ki uske maujuuda aakaar kaa koi vaastavik arth ho, sivaay us maamle main jab sanchika kii saamagree, ek drudh sangrah ke samooh ke andar kii kuch saamagree ho
 For example, in a Unix-like system, the file to which the link to / bin / ls points is defined and rarely changed
 isaki tulana / dev / null se karen to yah bhi ek sanchika he par iskaa aakaar hameshaa badalata rahata he balki shaayad us tarah myne hi nahin rakhata he jaise pichley udhaaharan kaa myne rakhata he
 The information and small information contained in a computer file can be in the form of bundles or can also be movable
 yah maatr sanchika ke rachanaakaar par nirbhar he ki usamen jaankaree kaa aayojan kis prakaar kiya jayega
 For this reason, many low-standard file structures exist that can serve any purpose, from the simplest to the most complex
 adhiktar sanganak sanchikaon kaa istemaal sanganak kaarykram karte hai
 These programs create, change and delete the appropriate files for their use
 jo kaarykram-nirmaataa in kaaryakramon ko banaate hai, vahi faisalaa karte hai ki koun si filon kii zarurat he, unka istemaal kaise hona he or unke naam bhi ve nirdhaarit karte hai
 In some cases, computers manipulate program files in such a way that they are visible to the computer user
 udhaaharan ke liye shabd-sansaadhan carkram main prayokta dastauez sanchikaon main badlaav karte hai or prayokta khud hi unhen naam bhi dete hai
 The contents of the document file are organized in such a way that the word-processing program understands it, but the user determines its name and storage address, and the key information of storage is also determined by the user
 kai anuprayog sabhi saamagree sanchikaon ko ek hi sanchika main ghused dete hai or alag alag prakaar kii jaankaree kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye andar hi nishaan laga ke rakhte hai
 Content files from games like Doom and Quake are an example of this
 sanganak par, sanchikaon ko bananaa, badalanaa, badhanaa, chota karnaa, sthanantarit karnaa or mitaanaa sambhav he
 In most cases, all this is done by running computer programs on the computer, but the user of the computer can also make changes to files if needed
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft verde kii sanchikaaye aamtaur par prayokta ke nirdeshon ke aadhaar par microsaft verde kaarykram dwaara banaai jaati hai, lekin prayokta in sanchikaon ko sidhe hi windos explorer jaise kisi sanchika prabandhak kaarykram ke jariye bhi hataa, mitaa yaa sthanantirit kar saktaa he
 In unix-like systems, user-zone processes usually do not directly connect to files; The operating system provides a segregation level that allows almost all transactions with files from the user-area to occur through hard links
 kathor kadiyon ke jariye kisi sanchika kaa naam diya ja saktaa he ; vishuddh rup se prachaalan pranali main sanchikaon ke naam nahin hote hai
 For example, user-area programs cannot delete a file, they can only delete a link to that file, and if the linker finds that the file no longer has any other links, it can delete this file
 Can be erased
 vastav main keval ashthi hi sanchikaon se len-dein karata he, par prayokta-kshetra ke anurodhon kaa sanchikaon ke jariye is tarah hota he ki prayokta-kshetra kaaryakramon ko yah agyaat hi rahata he
 While the transaction of programs with files varies according to the operating system and file system, mainly these activities are common: aadhunik sanganak pranaaliyon main sanchikaon tak pahunchne ke liye aamtaur par filanaamon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some operating systems, this name is associated with the file
 kuch anya main sanchika swayan benaam hoti he, par namit kadiyaan uski ore ingit karti hai
 In this case, the user can only recognize the link as the file name, but this will not be true, especially when the same file has more than one link
 sanchikaaye nirdeshikaon main ho sakati hai
 But it would be better to say that the directory can contain a list of files or a list of links to files
 is paribhaasha ke antargat yah samajhnaa bahut zaruri he ki "sanchika" shabd main nirdeshikas bhi shaamil hai
 This makes staging of directories possible, ie subdirectories inside directories
 jo naam kisi nirdeshika ke andar kisi sanchika ko sanderbhit karata he, use anokhaa hona zaruri he
 But some operating systems also specify a type with a name, which makes it possible to have two different types of files in a directory with the same name, such as a directory and a file of the same name
 jin paryaavarnon main sanchikaaye namit hoti hai, unamem, sanchika ke naam va path kii jodi anokhi honi zaruri he - koi bhi do sanchikaon kaa naam va path dono kisi or sanchika ke naam va path se mail nahin kha sakate hai
 Where the file is anonymous, named references will reside under a namespace
 adhiktar baar kisi bhi namasthaan main maujuud naam thik ek yaa shunya sanchikaon ko sanderbhit karegaa
 However, any file can be referenced in a namespace with zero, one or more names
 anuprayog ke prasang ke anusaar, kisi bhi sanchika yaa kadi ke liye upyukt naam kinhin khaas aksharon se bani hogi
 The computer system depends on whether the name is appropriate or not
 praarambhik sanganak kisi sanchika ke naam main simit akshar va ankon kii anumati dete the, lekin aadhunik sanganak lambey naam rakhane dete hai jinamein lagbhag kisi bhi kram main unicode akshar yaa unicode ank ho sakate hai, taaki ek hi nazar main sanchika kaa makasad samaj aa jaae
 Some computer systems allow empty spaces in file names, some do not
 sanchika naamon kii laghuderghakshar samvedansheeltaa sanchika pranali dwaara nirdhaarit hoti he
 Unix file systems are typically short-term and allow user-level applications to create files that contain only short and long letters
 microsoft windos kai sanchika pranaliyaan pradaan karata he, jinamein lugh-deergh samvedansheeltaa kii nitiyaan alag alag hai
 If the user uses a disk editor to change file names in directory entries, then the prevalent FAT system may contain many files whose names differ only by capitalization
 lekin, aamtaur par prayokta anuprayog isaki anumati nahin dete hai
 Most computers organize files based on steps and use folders, directories or catalogs for this
 shabd jo bhi ho vichaar ek hi he
 Each folder may contain some number of files and may contain other folders
 in anya folderon ko upfolder kehete hai
 These may contain more files and folders, etc
, etc
, by creating a tree-like structure containing a "master folder" or under which any number of files and folders can be
 folderon ke bhi sanchikaon kii tarah naam ho sakate hai 
 It is easy to organize files logically through folders
 jab bhi koi sanganak folderon kaa istemaal karata he to harek sanchika va folder kaa keval apana naam hi nahin apitu ek path bhi hota he jo yah darshata he ki vah sanchika yaa folder kis folder yaa folderon main maujuud he
 In this path, a special mark - such as / - is written between the file or folder names
 udhaaharan ke liye is lekh main die udhaaharan main, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers yah darshata he ki Managers naamak ek sanchika, Salaries naamak folder main he, r yah folder Payroll main he
 There is a forward line between the file and folder names, the topmost or root folder has no name, so the name starts with a forward line
 kai sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon me vistaaron kaa istemaal karte hai, inhen sanchika prakaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Windows computers, the extension takes the form of a dot after the name of the file and a few characters before the point, these characters are the type of file identified
 
txt vistaar paathya sanchika kaa pahchaan he, 
doc vistaar kisi dastauez kaa pahchaan he, khaastaur par microsoft verde sanchika praaroop main; aadi ityadi
 Even when extensions are used on the computer system, there is considerable diversity in the extent to which the computer system recognizes and behaves according to them, in some systems they are indispensable, while in others they are also present
 It does not matter, they are ignored
 kai aadhunik sanganak pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko nuksaan pahunchne se rokane ke tareeke pradaan karti he
 Computers that allow more than one user also enforce file permissions to control which files and folders can be created, deleted, or changed
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi prayokta ko ek sanchika ko badalane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin, yaa phir sanchikaaye va folder banane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin
 It can also be determined through permissions that only a few users can see the contents of a file or folder
 anumatiyon ke jariye sanchikaon main maujuud saamagree ke avaidh badlaav yaa vinaash se bachaav hota he or nijee jaankaree ko gopneey rakhane ke liye avaidh prayoktaaon ko kuch sanchikaaye dekhne se roka ja saktaa he
 Many computers have another rescue method known as "read only mark"
 yah chihn lage hone par sanchiko kaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he par badla nahin ja saktaa he
 This sign is useful for critical information that should not be changed or erased, such as for certain files used by internal components of a computer system
 kuch pranaliyaan ek "chhipi hui chihn" bhi shaamil karti hai, jo yah sunishchit karata he ki sanchika adrishy ho jaae
 With this symbol, the computer system hides important system files that should not be changed by users
 uparokt charchaa main sanchika kaa varnan ek ucch stareey prachaalan pranali yaa prayokta ke liye ek pariklpana ke taur par hua he
 However, any file must be physically present to be truly workable
 arthath, ek sanchika kii amoort avadharana ko vaastavik sanganak pranali main vaastavik bhautik rup main hona aavashyak he, anyathaa uskaa aastitiv hona na hona baraabar he
 Physically, most computer files are stored in some kind of content storage device
 udhaaharan he hard jisk, jiske jariye adhiktar prachaalan pranaliyaan chalati hai
 Most of the files are kept in these
 21veen sadi ke praarabdh main hard discs sarvaadhik uplabdh gaiyr vaashpashil bhandaaran upkaran he
 If the files contain only temporary contents, they can be stored in RAM
 unics jaisi prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchikaon kaa kisi bhautik bhandaaran upkaran se sidhaa vaasta nahin hota he: / dev / null iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan he, isi tarah / dev, / proc or / sys ke antarangat maujuud lagbhag sabhi sanchikaaye bhi isi prakaar kii hai
 They can be used as files in the user area
 lekin ye abhaasi sanchikaaye hai jo vastav main keval prachaalan pranali kii ashthi kii vastuon ke taur par vidyaman rahati hai
 Computer files can be stored in magnetic strips
 kuch sthitiyon main sanchikaon ko anya madhyamon main bhi bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he jaise ki lekhneey kampact discs, ankiy bahuvid discs, zip drive, yuasabi flash drive aadi
 When the computer files contain very important information, the copying process tries to avoid the consequences in situations where the files can be lost
 sanchikaon kii pratilipi karne kaa matlab bas yahi he ki sanchikaon kii pratiyaan kisi anya sthaan par baan ke rakhana taaki yadi mul sanganak ko kuch ho jaataa he yaa ve galati se mit jaati hai to prati ke jariye unhen waapas paaya ja sake
 There are several ways to copy files
 adhiktar sanganak pranaliyaan suvidhaatmak kaarykram pradaan karte hai jo ki prati rakhane kii prakriya main suvidha pradaan karte hai, kyonki yadi bahut si sanchikaon kii pratiyaan rakhni hai to isamen bahut samay lag saktaa he
 Files are often copied to transferable mediums such as writable cds or cartridge tapes
 ek hi sanganak kii duusari hard discs main sanchikaon ko pratilipit karne se ek discs ke kharaab hone se to bachaav ho jaataa he par yadi puure sanganak ke kharaab yaa nasht hone ke jokhim se bachaav karnaa he to un sanchikaon kii pratiyaan aise madhyam main karnaa zaruri he jo is sanganak se dur le ja ke kisi surakshit jagah par bhandaarit kii ja sake
 The grand-father-son copy method automatically creates three copies, the oldest copy of the file being the grandfather file and the son existing copy
 kis sanganak dwaara sanchikaon ko yojit, namit, bhandaarit va parivartit karne kii pranali ko uski sanchika pranali kaha jaataa he
 Most operating systems have at least one file system
 kai prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchika pranaliyaan ek saath chalaai ja sakati he
 For example, newer MS Windows computers support older fat-style file systems of MS-DOS, as well as NTFS, the popular file system of the latest Windows versions
 har pranali ke apane faayde nuksaan hai
 For example, in standard FAT, only 8-letter file names run, whereas NTFS contains possible long file names that may contain spaces
 aap kisi sanchika ko antiatioes main Payroll records jaisaa naam de sakate hai lekin effeti main yah naam kuch payroll
dat jaisaa hi ho saktaa he 
 File manager programs are convenient programs through which files and folders can be moved, created, deleted, or renamed, but they do not actually allow you to read or add content to the file
 har sanganak pranali apni mul sanchika pranali ke liye kam se kam ek sanchika prabandhak pradaan karata he
 The most commonly used file manager program in Windows is Windows Explorer and on Mac it is Finder
 linaks main notilas, conkvarar jaise kai sanchika prabandhak hai
 The use of the English word "file" for file storage in reference to computer storage was started since 1952 for information stored in camouflage leaves
 praarambhik prayog main log antarnihit tantransh ko hi fil kehete the
 For example, IBM 350's disk drives were called "disk files"
 1962 ke sangat samay saajha pranali jaisi pranaaliyon main aisi sanchika pranaliyaan thim jo ek hi sanchay upkaran par kai "sanchikaaye" pradarshit karti thim or is tarah is shabd kaa aadhunik upyog shuru hua
 CTSS file names had two parts, a user-readable "principal name" and the other "secondary name" that indicated the type of file
 yah aachaar kai prachaalan pranaaliyon dwaara aaj bhi kaam main liya jaataa he, inamen microsoft windos bhi shaamil he
 While the "register file" used today shows the initial hypothesis of files, it is often lost

 aapas main sambandhit bhashaaon ko bhashaa-parivaar kehete hai
 There are scientific grounds for which languages belong to which family
 is samay sansar kii bhashaaon kii teen avasthaaen hai
 The ancient languages of various countries, which have not been studied and categorized for lack of sufficient material, are in the first stage
 inkaa astitv inamen uplabdh pracheen shilalekho, sikkon or hastlikhit pustakon main abhi surakshit he
 Similar languages are Sumerian, the old language of Mesopotamia and Etruscan, the ancient language of Italy
 duusari avasthaa main aisi aadhunik bhashaayen hai, jinka samyak shodh ke abhaav main adhyayan or vibhaajan prachur saamagree ke hote hue bhi nahin ho sakaa he
 Basque, Bushman, Japanese, Korean, Andamanese etc
 languages are in this stage
 teesri avasthaa kii bhashaaon main paryaapt saamagree he or unka adhyayan evam vargeekaran ho chukaa he
 Many developed and prosperous languages like Greek, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, English etc
 are under it
 bhashaa kaa sambandh vyakti, samaaj or desh se hota he
 Therefore each language has its own special feature
 inke aadhaar par vah ek ore kuch bhashaaon se samanta sthapit karti he or duusari ore bahut-si bhashaaon se asamanta
 Mainly there are two types of this characteristic equilibrium-morphological and semantic
 pratham ke antargat shabdon kii akruti arthath shabdon or vaakyon kii rachanastyli kii samanta dekhi jaati he
 In the second there is a similarity of meaning
 inke anusaar bhashaaon ke vargeekaran kii do paddatiyaan hoti hai–akritimulak or paariwarik yaa aitihaasik
 This discussion is related to historical classification, so its bases should be known in some detail
 isamen akritimulak samanta ke atirikt nimnilikhit samantaayein bhi honi chahie
 Geographically, there is often a similarity in proximate languages and inequality in remote languages
 is aadhaar par sansar kii bhashaayen africa, uresia, prashantmahasaagar or america ke khadon main vibhajit kii gayi hai
 However, this basis is not scientific to much extent
 kyonki do samipsth bhashaayen ek-duusare se bhinn ho sakati hai or do duurastha bhashaayen paraspar samaan
 Hindi and Malayalam are two different family languages of India but Sanskrit and English are languages of the same family in remote countries like India and England
 samaan shabdon kaa prachlan jin bhashaaon main rahata he unhen ek kul ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he
 This similarity is based on the proximity of linguists and is possible in two ways
 ek hi samaaj, jati athwa parivaar ke vyaktiyon dwaara shabdon ke samaan rup se vyavahrut hote rahane se samanta aa jaati he
 Apart from this, when people of different countries or castes come into contact with each other for political or commercial development after the development of civilization and means, equality is established between them by exchange of words
 paariwarik vargeekaran ke liye pratham prakaar kii anurupata hi kaam kii hoti he
 Because such words are the original words of the language
 inamen bhi nityprati ke kautumbik jivan main prayukt honevaale sangya, sarvnaam aadi shabd hi adhik upyogi hote hai
 The biggest difficulty in this premise is that with the development of words from other languages, the original words get mixed up in such a way that it becomes difficult to identify and separate them
 is kathinaayee kaa samaadhaan ek seemaa tak arthgat samanta he
 Because many words in the languages of a family are similar in meaning and such words relate them to a family
 isliye arthparak samanta bhi ek mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 Each language has its own theory of sound and pronunciation
 yahi kaaran he ki vah anya bhashaaon kii dhvaniyon se jaldi prabhavit nahin hoti hai or jahaan tak ho saktaa he unhen dhvaninium ke anusaar apni nearesth dhvaniyon se badal leti he
 For example, the A, B, f etc
 sounds of Persian are converted to nearby A, B, f etc
 in Hindi
 atah dhvanisamya kaa aadhaar shabdaawalee-samta se adhik vishwasaneey he
 By the way, sometimes the sounds of one language also develop together in the sounds group of one language and confuse the comparative conclusions
 arya bhashaaon main vaidic kaal se pehle murdhanya dhvaniyaan nahin thi, kintu dravid bhashaa ke prabhaav se aage chalakar viksit ho gayin
 The grammatical basis is most authentic
 kyonki bhashaa kaa anushaasan karne ke kaaran yah jaldi badalata nahin he
 Under the similarity of grammar, word-formation by applying suffix to metal, metal, grammatical process, it is necessary to determine the similarity of terms and structure of terms, etc
 in words
classification of languages is done on in chaar aadhaaron par bhashaaon kii adhikadhik samanta nishchit karte unka vargeekaran kiya jaataa he
 In this regard, it should be clearly understood that this equilibrium is relative
 jahaan ek ore bhaaropee parivaar kii bhashaayen anya parivaar kii bhashaaon se bhinn or aapas main samaan hai vahaan duusari ore sanskrit, farsi, greek aadi bhaaropee bhashaayen ek-duusare se inhen aadhaaron par bhinn bhi hai
 At the time of classification, entire languages are divided into Eurasia, Pacific, Sea, Africa and America segments or cycles based on geographical proximity
 phir aapasi samanta rakhanevaali bhashaaon ko ek kul yaa parivaar main rakhkar vibhinn parivaar banaaye jate hai
 a comparison of Avesta, Persian, Sanskrit, Greek etc
 showed that there is a lot of similarity in their vocabulary, sound group and composition
 atah bharat or europe ke is tarah kii bhashaaon kaa ek bhartiya kul bana diya gaya he
 Families are divided into classes
 bhaaropee parivaar main shatam or kentum aise hi varg hai
 Classes are divided into branches
 shatam varg kii ‘irani’ or ‘bhartiya arya’ pramukh shakhaayen hai
 Branches have been divided into sub branches
 grearsan ne aadhunik bhartiya arya bhashaaon ko bhitari or bahari upashakha main vibhakt kiya he
 Hence, subdivisions are divided into language communities and community languages
 is tarah bhashaa paariwarik-vargeekaran kii ikai he

 About half of the world's population speaks indo-european language

 It is also called 'monosyllabic family'
 kaaran ki iske mul shabd praaia: ekakshar hote hai
 These languages are spoken in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Nepal, Sikkim, West Bengal, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram
 isaki pramukh bhashaaon main arami, aseri, sumeri, akkadi or kanani vagairah shaamil thim lekin aajkal is samooh kii prasiddhtam bhashaayen arabi or ibrani hai
 These languages mainly consist of three metal-letters and by making vowels in between, they form verbs and nouns

 Eden, or itself, was the place in many Abrahamic religions where God placed them after the creation of the first man and the first woman

 According to Christian belief, God had given them out of this garden for disobeying His command by convicting them both as sinners
 isai mat kii bahut si dharanaayen is mul paap par aadhaarit hai
 In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve lived like children in utter ignorance and blissfully
 ve puri tarah nagn rahete the kyonki unhen yon sambandhon kaa koi gyaan nahin tha or koi shame nahin anubhav hoti thi
 There was a tree in this garden which is called "tree of Knowledge"
 usapar lage fal kaa khaanaa ishwar ne spasht rup se aadam ko varjit kiya tha
 According to Christian belief, a serpent first incited Eve and then Eve instigated Adam to eat the fruit of knowledge
 aadam ne ajna-ulanghan kii or fal kha liya
 This ended his innocence and Adam and Eve felt ashamed to see each other
 unhone kuch anjir ke patton ke chote vastra banaakar apane kuch ang dhakne kaa prayaas kiya
 When God came to meet him and saw this, he understood that Adam had eaten the fruit of knowledge and came in a fierce rage
 unhone aadam or hawwa ho eden se nikaal diya
 In Christian beliefs, humans have been wandering the world since then in a sinful state
 is eden-nikaale ko isai dharm main "maanav kaa patan" kaha jaataa he
 It is also believed that every human is a born sinner who will go to hell posthumously because Adam and Eve's sins are exaggerated
 ise "mul paap" kaha jaataa he
 Slaying of creatures, harvesting unnecessary green trees, causing waste to someone, shedding waste water, etc
 is a sin
 isai dharm main mana jaataa he ki isa messiah ne apni qurabaani dekar un maanvon ko narak se bachaaya jo unhen apana bhagwaan sweekaarte hai
 There has been a lot of disagreement about this belief
 shuddh rup se yah avadharana yah kahati he ki yadi koi navjaat shishu bina isaikaran samaaroh ke mar jaae to vah narak jaataa he
 It also implies that if a person does not listen to Christianity but lives the life of a saint and does not commit any sin throughout his life, he will go to hell because he is laden with original sin without accepting Christianity
 vartmaan yug main bahut se isai or gair-isai lekhakon ne in manyataon kii aalochana kii he
 These criticisms have taken different forms: Some say that the concept of original sin may cause people to live without guilt and their sense of God is less of love and more of fear
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki in kathaon main maanvon kii eden main nirdosh avasthaa ke chithran se yon sambandhon ko lekar aswasth vichaardhaaraen utpann ho jaati hai, kyonki yah ek shaktishaalee maanviya bhaavana he jise kuchlaa to nahin ja saktaa lekin aparaadh-bhav se dekhne se yah hanikaarak prakaar se besangi hokar prakat hoti he
 The story of Eden in the Indian subcontinent came from Islamic sources
 kyonki aadam pehla purush mana jaataa he isliye unhen "baba aadam" kaha jane laga or kisi bhi puraani kahani ko muhaavarey main "baba aadam kii kahani" kaha jaataa he
 If there is no one at any place, it is said that there was "neither Adam nor Adam's life"
 eden kii katha main hawwa ne aadam se gyanafal khaane ko kaha tha isliye aksar vyangy main "nari purush ke patan kaa kaaran he" suna jaataa he
 This story is also pointed out in regional poetry
 udhaaharan ke liye gaalib kii prasiddh "hazaron khwaahishen aisi" naamak ghazal ke is sher main ek premi apni chaheti kii gali se nikalwane kii beijwati kii tulana aadam ke eden se nikaale jane se karata he: In English, "fig leaves" are used to try to hide a shameful act
 "it is a big scandal and this report is just a fig-leaf" kaa arth hua "yah bahut bada kand he or yah report to keval ek anjir kaa patta he"

 All the particles mentioned in the standard model have been observed experimentally, with the Higgs boson being discovered as the last particle
 fermion mul kanon kii do shreniyon main se ek he, anya shrenee boson he
 Fermion particles are those particles described by the Fermi Dirac statistic and whose quantum number is determined by the Pauli exclusion law
 isamen quark or lepton tathaa inke dwaara nirmit koi bhi sanyukt kan jo inaki visham sankhyaon se milakar bana ho shaamil hai, jaise berion or vibhinn parmaanuon ke nabhik
 The rotation of fermions is a semi-multiple of integers; The rotation of all known radicals is 1⁄2

 To date, it is not known whether the neutrino dirac is Fermion or Myorana fermion
 quark hadronon ke moolbhoot ghatak hote hai or inaki anyonya kriya prabal anyonya kriya hoti he
 Among known charged particles, only quarks are particles on which the charge value is fractional but are not found to be independent and are found as a group of three or a group of two
 atah prakruti main keval purnank aavesh hi prekshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their antagonists are per-quarks, which differ only in the form of negative values of charge
 abhi tak prekshit kanon main chah bhinn prakaar ke quark hote hai jinamein se teen dhanatmak aaweshit hote hai jabaki anya teen par aavesh rinatmak hota he
 Leptones do not participate in strong interactions

 The antimatter of electron is called positron for historical reasons
 kan bhautikee ke maanak model ke anusaar kul chah prakaar ke lepton hote hai jinamein se teen aaweshit lepton hote hai jinhen electron-sadrush lepton kehete hai tathaa anya teen lepton aaveshrahit hote hai jinhen nutrino kehete hai
 Bosons are types of radicals that are different from fermions
 boson un kanon ko kaha jaataa he jo bose-oinstin sankhyikee kaa paalan karte hai or purnank prachakran rakhte hai
 Bosons may be radicals such as: photons, gluons, etc
, or complex particles such as mesons
 prakruti ke sabhi moolbhoot bal gej boswanon dwaara vyavahit hote hai or dravyaman higgs kshetra dwaara nirmit mana jaataa he
 The basic bosons according to the standard model are the following: ati-samamitiya siddhanton ke anusaar kuch ore bhi kan maujuud hai jinamein se ek bhi 2014 tak prekshit nahin kiya gaya: Note: Just as the photon, z Boson and w ± bosons are superpositions of the B0, W0, W1, and W2 fields - the photino, zino, and wino ± are superpositions of the bino0, wino0, wino1, and wino2 by definition
 No matter if one uses the original gauginos or this superpositions as a basis, the only predicted physical particles are neutrino s and chargeinos as a superposition of them together with the Higgsinos
 Other theories predict the existence of additional bosons: Mirror particles are predicted by theories that restore parity symmetry
 Magnetic monopole is a generic name for particles with non-zero magnetic charge
 They are predicted by some guts
 Tachyon is a generic name for hypothetical particles that travel faster than the speed of light and have an imaginary rest mass
 Preons were suggested as subparticles of quarks and leptons, but modern collider experiments have all but ruled out their existence
 Kaluza – Klein towers of particles are predicted by some models of extra dimensions
 The extra-dimensional momentum is manifested as extra mass in four-dimensional spacetime

 at Duke University in North Carolina
 Raine and his wife Louisa tried to develop mental science in an experimental research

 Louisa Raine focused on the collection of spontaneous cases, while J
B
 Raine worked extensively in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and PISI and designing tests for her experiments
 card ke saral set ko viksit kiya gaya tha jinhen mul rup se jiner card kaha jaataa he - vartmaan main ise ESP card kaha jaataa he
 They produced circles, squares, wavy lines, crosses and star symbols; a packet of 25 has five leaves each
 ek telepathy prayog main, "preshak" card kii ek shrunkhlaa main dikhataa he, jabaki "resiver" pratikon kaa anumaan lagaataa he
 In an attempt to see clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden when the receiver guesses
 purv bodh ko jaanane kii koshish main, anumaan ke baad taash ke patton ke kram ko nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 In all such experiments, the order of the cards must be random so that the approximation cannot be obtained through systematic biases or prior knowledge
 sabase pehle card ko haath se milaayaa jaataa he or uske baad mashin dwaara
 baad main, yadrichhik sankhya main teble kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha, vartmaan main computer kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 An advantage of ESP cards is that the figures can be easily applied to detect whether the numbers of correct estimates obtained are greater than the probability of guessing
 rin ne vishyon ke rup main aam logon kaa istemaal kiya or daawa kiya ki ausatan unhone ummid se behatar kiya
 He later used dice to test for psychokinesis, and also claimed that these results were better than expected

 Among these were psychologists from the University of Colorado and Hunter College, New York who completed the study with an excessive sample number and the highest level of significance

 An early statistical study of ESP that used card estimation was conducted in the 1920s by Ina Jephson

 In addition to card estimation, more successful experiments with procedures were conducted

 The most notable focusing effect is in decade-long research with Stepanek Powell

 Those who believe in PSI have higher chances of scoring, while those who do not believe in PSI have zero or psi-absent results
 ise "sheep-got prabhaav" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Fall prediction and other status effects have proved challenging, although they are often identified in collected data for the purpose of looking at other effects
 vyaktitv or vyavhaar prabhaav paramanovaigyanik database ke meta-vishleshan ke saath purv bodh kshamtaaon ko pradarshit karte hai or sanchit data par mahatvapurn or vishwasaneey prabhaavon ke hone ke liye sheep-got prabhaav or anya visheshtaon ko pradarshit karte hai
 In the 1960s, the development of cognitive psychology and humanistic psychology, as well as the cognitive tools of ESP, the subjective experience involved in the creation of ESP responses, and the role of ESP in psychological life, led to rapid development of parapsychologists
 udhaaharan ke liye smriti ko bodh ke bajaae piesai ke ek behatar model ke rup main peshkash kiya gaya tha
 This was called for experimental procedures, which, according to Rhine, were not limited to the forced-choice method
 ni:shulk pratikriya upaay, jaise 1930 ke dashak main kairington dwaara prayog kiya jaataa tha, jisase pratibhaagiyon kii samvedansheeltaa ko badhaane ke prayaas ke saath unki bodh ko viksit kiya jaataa tha
 These procedures included relaxation, meditation, rem-sleep, and gangefields

 Outside of laboratory research and in natural settings and taking advantage of naturally occurring conditions is a related development
 piesai jaisi ghatnaon, jaise ESP ke adhyayan ko paramanovigyaan kaha jaataa he
 The consensus of the Parapsychological Association is that certain mental facts, such as psychokinesis, telepathy, and astral projection, are fully established
 atirikt samvedi bodh kii adhikansh ghatana kaha jaataa he ki aisi paristhitiyon main swatah hoti he jo vaigyanik rup se niyantrit nahin hoti he
 Such experiences have often been found to be stronger and more pronounced than in laboratory experiments
 prayogshaala sakshya ke bajaay in reporton ne aitihaasik drushti se in ghatnaon kii pramanikta main vyapak dharna ke liye aadhaar diya he
 However, such controlled experiences have proved extremely difficult to replicate under controlled scientific conditions
 ESP ghatana ke samarthak vibhinn adhyayanon kaa hawala dete hai jisamen is ghatana ke astitv ke saboot kii charchaa he: jebi rin, rasel taarg, herold i
 putahof ke kaaryon main or 1970 ke dashak main esarai international ke bhautikavidon ke prayogon ko aksar bahes main uddhrut kiya jaataa he ki ESP maujuud he
 The main current debate about ESP is around whether statistically rigorous laboratory evidence has been accumulated for this
 adhikansh sweekaar kiye gaye parinaam sab thode yaa mahatvapurn sankhyikeey parinaam hai
 Critics may dispute the positive interpretation of results obtained in scientific studies of ESP, as they claim that they are difficult to reproduce reliably and have little effect
 paramanovaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki kai adhyayanon ke data bataate hai ki kuch vyaktiyon ne lagaataar ullekhneey parinaam die hai, jabaki shesh logon ke parinaam chote hone ke baavjood behad mahatvapurn pravriti ke he or unhen khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 There is a common belief that a hypnotized person is capable of exhibiting ESP
 cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke manovigyaan vidwaan, karl sargent ne sammohan-esp sambandh ke praarambhik daavon ko suna or uski satyata kii jaanch ke liye ek prayog taiyaar kiya
 They recruited 40 fellow college students, none of whom had ESP identified, and then divided them into a group that had to be hypnotized with 25 Zener cards before testing, and a non-hypnotized controlled group
 Which was to be tested with the same card
 niyantrit chaatro ne 25 sahi main se ausat rup se 5 ank paae, bilkul vaisaa hi jaisaa anjaane main ho saktaa tha
 The hypnotized students performed twice as well as them and averaged 11
9 points out of 25 correct
 sargent kii is prayog kii apni vyakhya yah he ki ESP man shant or unmukt avasthaa se juda he, chetana ke adhik sangyaheen str se
 Of the scientists at the National Academy of Sciences, 96% described themselves as "confused" with regard to ESP, 4% believed in SAI, 10% believed that psychological research should be encouraged
 rashtriya vigyaan academy ne isse pehle maansik vikaas kaaryakramon par inhencing human parformens report pryojit kii thi, jo paramanovaigyaniktaa ke bare main ndehpurn thi
 Skeptics claim that the scientific method that shows significant statistical evidence about ESP has not been documented, that there is a lack of viable theory behind the ESP system, and that there are historical cases in which paramedical studies Flaws have been found in the experimental design of
 prayogtmak paramanovigyaan ke aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki aise koi susangat or sahmati vaale maanak nahin hai jiske dwaara "ESP" shakti kaa pareekshan kiya ja saktaa he
 It is argued that when psychopaths are challenged by skepticism and fail to prove their perceived powers, they make all kinds of arguments as to the cause of their failure, such as the skeptic's use of them
 Is influenced by its "negative energy"
