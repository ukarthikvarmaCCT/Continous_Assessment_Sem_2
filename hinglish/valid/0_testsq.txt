 nirdeshak ron harvard ne angels and dimons ko purv kadi ke rup main prastut karne kii jagah, agali kadi ke rup main prastut karnaa chaha, kyonki kai logon ne da vinci code ke baad is upanyaas ko padhaa tha
 He liked the idea that Langdon had completed an adventure and became a very confident character
 yah upanyaas, da vinci code se bhi kam lokapriy hone ke kaaran, harvard ke liye roopantaran main kahani ke saath zyaada chhot lenaa adhik suvidhajanak bhi tha
 Producer Brian Grazer said that while Da Vinci was converting the code, he was quite "respectful", resulting in it being "a bit too long and dramatic"
 is baar, "langdon ruk kar, bhaashan dene nahin lagata
 jab vah bolta he, vah gatisheel rahata he"
 harvard ne sahmati jataai ki "yah aadhuniktaa kii puraatanta ke saath takaraahat or vishwaas banaam praudyogiki he, atah ye vishay, ye vichaar adhik sakriy hai, jabaki doosraa ateet main zyaada basaa tha

 Due to the huge international interest in the election of Pope Benedict XVI, it was considered out of date and the level of public and press interest in the film was shown to be very high
 film kaa ant bhi kaafii badal gaya tha
 In the novel, Langdon accompanied Camerlengo on a chopper
 iske alaava, pope ke saath cameralango ke rishte ko bhi, jaivik bete ke bajaay dattak putr main badal diya gaya

 Despite these, he felt that early filming helped him refine the naturalism he used in his previous film, Frost / Nixon, where handheld cameras were used to add extra vigor to the scenes

 Cameron asked the twenty crew members to take as many photographs as possible from within the Sistine Chapel, and asked the painters to sketch, photograph, and mass reproduction of the paintings and mosaics from those photographs
 Cameron wanted to show Sistine Chappell the way he was before his cleanup, as he liked the foggy and dull colors that the cardinals would show
 haalanki chapel ko puure aakaar main banaaya gaya, par saalaa rejia ko chota banaaya gaya, taaki manch ke andar feet ho sake
 The sets of St
 Peter's Square and Piazza Navona were built on the same stage; Upon completion of the scenes in the first place, it took six weeks to replace the set, by breaking the fences of the temple and excavating a 3 1 / 2 feet paved road to construct the fountain

 The Buddha instructed his disciple Anand to explain to Kunda that he had made no mistake
 unhone kaha ki yah bhojan atuly he
 Lord Buddha preached the Middle Way to the people
 unhone dukh, uske kaaran or nivaaran ke liye ashtangik maarg sujhaayaa
 He has laid great emphasis on non-violence

 The essence of Buddha's teachings is as follows - buddha ke dharm prachaar se bhikshuon kii sankhya badhane lagi
 Great kings and emperors also started becoming his disciples
 shuddhodhan or rahul ne bhi buddha dharm kii diksha lee
 The Buddhist Sangha was established when the number of monks increased greatly
 baad main logon ke aagrah par buddha ne striyon ko bhi sangh main le lene ke liye anumati de di, yadhyapi ise unhone utana acha nahin mana
 Lord Buddha sent monks here and there to propagate their religion in the country and abroad for 'bahujan Hitay' folk welfare
 ashok aadi samraaton ne bhi videshon main buddha dharm ke prachaar main apni aham bhoomika nibhaai
 By the time of Mauryan period, Buddhism had spread from India to China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Burma, Thailand, Indian China, Sri Lanka etc

 Emphysema is a long-term progressive lung disease that initially causes shortness of breath
 vatasfiti se grast logon main sharir ko sahaara dene vaale utak or fefde ke kaary karne kii kshamta nasht ho jaati he
 It has been included in a group of diseases called long-term obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD
 Emphysema is a resistant disease of the lungs because destruction of the lung tissue surrounding the small airways called kripika makes these airways unable to maintain their functional shape while exhaling

 Emphysema is commonly related to chronic bronchitis
 chunki "shuddh" puraane bronchitis yaa vatasfiti ke maamalon ko samajhnaa mushkil he, isliye unhen saamanyat: ek saath milakar bahut dinon tak rahane vaali pratirodhi phuffusiya rog ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 Emphysema can be classified into primary and secondary colors
 haalanki, adhiktar ise sthaan ke aadhaar par hi vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Emphysema can be subdivided into panasinary and centroasinary and centriacinar, or as centrilobular and panlobular

 Emphysema is a disease of the lung tissue caused by the destruction of the structure that nourishes the papilla, in some cases due to the lack of function of alpha 1-antitrypsin
 iske kaaran jabardastee saans lete samay shwaas path par dhakka lagata he, kyoki vayukosh kaa sankuchan kam ho jaataa he
 As a result, air flow is blocked and the air gets trapped inside the lungs, in the same way as in other resistant lung diseases
 lakshanon main mehnat karte samay saans kii takalif evam chaati kaa phoolnaa shaamil he
 However, air circulation narrowing is not always immediate mortal and treatment is also available
 vatasfiti se grast adhikansh log dhumrapaan karne vaale hote hai
 The damage caused by emphysema is permanent even if the man quits smoking
 People suffering from this disease do not get enough oxygen and cannot eradicate carbon dioxide, so they always feel short of breath
 vatasfiti kaa praathmik kaaran cigarette pinaa he
 In some cases it may also be due to alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
 A1AD ke gambhir maamle ke kaaran liver serosis bhi viksit ho jaataa he, jahaan ekatrit alpha 1-antitripsin diphisiansi fibrotic pratikriya ko disha dete hai
 In normal breathing, air passes through the bronchi to the inside, which are small-sized bags surrounded by capillaries
 kripika oxigen ko avashoshit kar baad main ise khun main sthanantarit kar detii he
 When toxic things like cigarette smoke enter the lungs while breathing, its harmful particles get trapped in the tendon due to the stimulant reaction there
 is uttejk pratikriya ke dauraan rasayanon kaa nikalnaa antat: vayukosh jhilli ko teetar-vitar kar detaa he
 This condition, which we know as membranous fractures, leads to significant deformities in the lung structure
 in vikrutiyon ke parinamswaroop gas aadan-pradaan ke liye prayog main aanevaale kripika ke sataha ko gata detii he
 This results in a reduction in the transfer factor of the lung for carbon monocides

 Termination always depends on the function of the thoracic cag and abdominal muscles, especially in the late stages of termination
 Lack of ventilation leads to significant damage to the carbon dioxide leakage potential
 adhik gambhir maamalon main, oxigen ke jamaav main bhi kami aati he
 As the corpus worsens continuously, more air is not able to compensate for its surface area being progressively destroyed and the body is not able to retain enough oxygen in the blood
 The ultimate remedy for such a body is to vasoconstrict the right vessels
 yah palmonary ucch raktchaap kii ore le jaataa he jo hriday ke daayin ore dabaav banaata he, hriday kaa yah bhaag oxigen se las rakt ko fefde tak pravaahit karata he

 Emphysema caused by A1AD is known as peninsular emphysema, as opposed to centrilobular emphysema, which is caused by smoking
 panaciner vatasfiti aam taur par nichle fefdon ko prabhavit karata he jabaki centrilobular vatasfiti upree fefdon ko prabhavit karata he
 About 2% of total emphysema is caused by A1AD
 dhumrapan karne waalon ke saath A1AD vatasfiti ke liye sabase bada khatra he
 Mild emphysema often takes severe form in a very short time
 A1AD hamen rog ke rogaanuon ke paidaa hone kaa pataa detii he, jabaki A1AT diphisiansi rog ke kuch bhaag ke kaaran kii jaankaree detii he
 Better studies of the last century focused primarily on the hypothetical role of leukocyte elastase, with serine proteases found in neutrophils that have been the primary contributor to the destruction of connective tissue in disease
 jaanch kaa yah pareenam ki A1AT ke liye neutrophil elastage praathmik shuruuaati str he or A1AT neutrophil elastage kaa praathmik sandamak he, yah donon pariklpana milakar "protes-antiprotes " siddhant ke rup main jaani jaati rahi he, yah maanate hue ki neutrophil is rog kaa ek mahatvapurn madhyasth he
 However, recent studies have raised the possibility that one of the many proteases, particularly matrix metalloproteases, may be equivalent to or more relevant to neutrophils for the development of non-hereditary emphysema
 vatasfiti ke pathoginesis se sambandhit pichley kuch dashakon ke behatar shodhon main jaanwaron par prayog shaamil the, jahaan jaanwaron kii vibhinn prajatiyon ke trekia main protes ko daalkar prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Destruction of connective tissues developed in these animals which was taken as a support for the protease – antiprotease theory

 In relation to understanding of this disease, it is also important to assess whether those animals will be less susceptible to the development of this disease
 Unfortunately, people suffering from this disease often have very few days left, more than 0-3 years

 Pulmonary rehabilitation can be very effective in optimizing the quality of life of the patient and can tell them how to actively take care of themselves
 Patients with emphysema and chronic bronchitis can help themselves more than any other crippling disease
 vatasfiti kaa ilaaj jaruri hone par anticolindergix se saans kaa sahaara dekar, bronkodilators, steroid medication, sharir ko prabhavi avasthaa main rakhkar, tathaa vaikalpik oxigen ke dwaara bhi kiya ja saktaa he

 nirdhaarit kiye gaye poorak aksigen kaa upyog hi ekmaatr non-sargical ilaaj he, jiske dwaara vatasfiti ke rogiyon ko lanbaa jivan diya ja saktaa he
 There are lightweight portable oxygen systems that increase mobility of patients
 poorak oxigen kaa prayog karte hue rogi vayuyatra kar sakate hai, gum sakate hai or kaam bhi kar sakate hai
 Other drugs are being researched
 langs wolum ridction surgery saavdhaneepurvak chune gaye kuch rogiyon ke jivan kii gunvattta main sudhaar kar sakati hai
 This can be done in different ways, some of which are less invasive

 The only known treatment for emphysema is lung transplant, but only some patients are so strong that they can bear this surgery
 vatasfiti ke ilaaj ke dauraan ek marij kii umr kaa sangyojan, oxigen haani or davaaiyon ke said-effects ke kaaran, dil or gurde or anya ang bekaar ho jate hai
 At the time of surgical transplant, the patient needs to take an anti-rejection drug regimen that suppresses the body's immune system, and can also cause a microbial infection in the patient
 jin rogiyon ko lagata he ki ve is rog ke shikaar ho gaye hai tab jitani jaldi ho sake, unhen iske upachaar par dhyaan dena chahie
 a study published in the European Respiratory Journal suggests that tretinoin derived from vitamin a reverses the effects of emphysema by resilience in the rat of mice
 jabaki vitamin a ke kanjpshan ko is rog ke prabhavi ilaaj yaa rokthaam ke rup me nahin liya jaataa, phir bhi yah anusandhan bhavishya main is rog ko dur karne ko ek disha de saktaa he
 Then in 2010, a study using vitamin-a to treat human emphysema yielded uncertain results and it was mentioned that further research is necessary to arrive at a conclusion about such treatment

 atyant pracheen kaal se paras desh aaryon kii ek shakha kaa vasasthaan tha jiskaa bhartiya aaryon se ghanisht sambandh tha
 In the very ancient Vedic era, the black land from the Paras to the banks of the Ganges Saryu was the Aryabhoomi, which was divided into several regions
 in pradeshon main bhi kuch ke saath arya shabd laga tha
 Just as Aryanvart was a region here, similarly in ancient Paras, the eastern region adjoining modern Afghanistan was called 'arian' or 'ariyan' from which the word Iran is derived
 iran shabd aryaavas ke arth main saare desh ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Shashanvanshi emperors have also called themselves the 'shahshahs of Iran'
 padaadhikariyon ke naamon ke saath bhi 'iran' shabd miltaa he
 - Such as 'iran-spahpat', 'iran Ambarakpat' etc
 pracheen parsi apane naamon ke saath arya shabd bade gaurav ke saath lagaate the
 The ancient emperor Daryavhu has written himself as 'ariyaputra'
 sardoron ke naamon main bhi arya shabd miltaa he, jaise, ariyashamn, ariovarjanis, ityadi
 Among the many regions in which the ancient Paras were divided, there was also the Parc or Parasya region lying on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Paras, after which the whole country was named after it
 isaki pracheen rajdhani parsipur thi, jahanper aage chalakar 'ishtakh' basaaya gaya
 The name 'paras' did not become famous during the Vedic period
 yah naam hakhaamaneey vansh ke samraaton ke samay se, jo parsy pradesh ke the, saare desh ke liye vyavahrut hone laga
 This is the reason why this word is not known in Vedas and Ramayana
 par mahabharat, raghuvansh, kathasaritsagar aadi main 'parsy' or parsikon kaa ullekh baraabar miltaa he
 The Zoroastrians and Vedic Aryans of the very ancient era did not distinguish between worship, ritual etc
 ve agni, surya vaayu aadi kii upasna or agnihotra karte the
 Myth, Vayu, Home, Armaiti, Ahman, Niryasam etc
 were his deities
 be bhi bade bade yashn karte, sompaan karte or athravan naamak yaajak kaath se kaath ragadkar agni utpann karte the
 Their language also originated from the same original Aryan language from which Vedic and cosmic Sanskrit derives
 pracheen parsi or vaidic sanskrit main koi vishesh bhed nahin jaan pasta
 The Avesta also has names of Indian territories and rivers
 jaise, haptahindu, harkhweti, haryu ityadi
 It is known from the Vedas that some gods were also called as Asura
 varun ke liye is sangya kaa prayog kai baar hua he
 Sayanacharya has written the meaning of the word Asura in the commentary - 'amur Sarveshan Pranad'
 indra ke liye bhi is sangya kaa prayog do ek jagah miltaa he, par yah bhi likhaa paaya jaataa he ki 'yah pad pradaan kiya hua he'
 This indicates that it had become a specific noun
 vedon main kramshah varun peeche padate gaye hai or indra ko pradhanta praapt hoti gai he
 At the same time the word Asura has also reduced
 peeche to asur shabd raaksham, daitya ke arth main hi miltaa he
 This shows that Devopasak and Asuropasak had joined these two parties between the Aryans
 paras kii ore zarathustra naamak ek rishi yaa rutvik hue jo asuropaskon ke paksh ke the
 He separated his branch and ran it under the name of 'jand Avasta'
 yahi 'jand avastaa' parsiyon kaa dharmagranth hua
 In 'jand Avasta', the word Dev has come to mean demon
 indra yaa vrutrahan daityon kaa raja kaha gaya he
 Shashrova and Nahanyatya have also been called demons
 anghr naamak agniyajakon kii prashansa kii gai he or sompaan kii ninda
 The worship is Ahuramazd, which is religion and truth
 ahraman adharm or paap kaa adhishthata he
 In this way, Jarayusastra conceived the two duality powers of religion and unrighteousness and preached purity
 zarathustra ke prabhaav se paras main kuch kaal ke liye ek ahurmajd kii upasna sthapit hui or bahut se devataaon kii upasna or karmkand kam hua
 But the public dissatisfaction was not complete with this subtle-minded religion
 shaashanon ke samay main mag yajkon or purohiton sa prabhaav badha tab bahut se sthool devataaon kii upasna phir jyon kii tyon jari ho gai or karmkand kii jatilta phir vahi ho gai
 These previous methods also got b in 'jand Apasta'
 'jand avastaa' main bhi veda ke samaan gaatha or manthr hai
 It has several divisions in which 'gath' is considered to be the oldest and originated from the mouth of Zarathustra
 ek bhaag kaa naam 'yashn' he jo vaidic 'yajna' shabd kaa roopaantar maatr he
 Vispard, Yasta, Bandidad etc
 are its other divisions
 badidad main jaraustra or ahurmajd kaa dharm sambandh main samvaad he
 The language of 'avasta', especially of the saga, appears to be a type of Vedic Sanskrit, a kind of illiteracy in reading
 kuch mantra to vedamantron se bilkul milte julate hai
 Dr
 Haag has illustrated this similarity with examples and Dr
 Mills has adapted many gathas as they are in Vedic Sanskrit
 zarathustra rishi kab hue the iskaa nishchay nahin ho sakaa he
 But there is no doubt that these happened in very ancient times
 shaashanon ke samay main jo 'avastaa' par bhashya swaroop anek granth bane unamem se ek main vyas hindi kaa paras main janaa likhaa he
 It is possible that Ved Vyas and Zarathustra are contemporaries

 saapeksh kantimaan kisi khagoleey vastu ke prithvi par baithe darshak dwaara prathit hone vaale chamkilepan ko kehete hai
 To measure the relative magnitude, there is a condition that there is no cloud, dust, etc
 in the sky and that object can be seen clearly
 nirpeksh kantimaan or saapeksh kantimaan donon ko maapne kii ikai "magnitude" kehalaati he
 Absolute current is the measure of an object's own luminosity and it is always seen how bright that object looks at a standard distance of 10 pars
 misaal ke liye agar kisi taare ke nirpeksh kantimaan kii baat ho rahi ho to yah dekha jaataa he ki yadi dekhne vaala us taare ke thik 10 parsac kii duuri par hota to vah tara kitna chamkila lagata
 In this way, there is a great difference between "absolute measure" and "relative measure"
 agar koi tara suraj se bees guna zyaada mul chamak rakhata ho lekin suraj se hazaar guna dur ho to prithvi par baithe kisi darshak ke liye suraj kaa saapeksh kantimaan adhik hoga, haalaanki duusare taare kaa nirpeksh kantimaan suraj se adhik he
 In English, "relative magnitude" is known as "absent magnitude" and "absolute magnitude" is called "absolute magnitude"

 yah film 20 farvari 2009 ko release hui, isane bahut acha box offis collection kiya, lekin aalochakon kii ore se ise mishrit samiksha hi praapt hui
 The film begins with the birth of a hero
 saath hi gende kaa phool=marigold bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 When Annapurna returns to her old home in Old Delhi, the ceremony is celebrated with much pomp
 roshan shuru main kai padosiyon kii bheed se pareshaan ho jaataa he, ye padosi hai: ali bag punarjagran purush, ek duusare se hameshaa ladate rahane vaale bhai madanagopal or jayagopal, unki patniyaan or parivaar, mamdu or halwai, gobar anaadi, seth ji or kai anya log
 However, Roshan finally feels relaxed in this place and wholeheartedly embraces the sense of community present here
 vah ramlila main apni daadi kaa saath detaa he, mamdu kii mithai kii dukaan par khadaa rahata he, bacchon ke saath kheltaa he or dhire dhire is sthaan kii samskruti main dub jaataa he
 Roshan also slowly comes into contact with some limited realities
 jab annapurna behosh ho jaati he or ve use jaldi se aspataal le jane kii koshish karte hai, us samay vah paata he ki sadak par trephic jam he, kyonki ek gaay vahaan bachhda de rahi hoti he, jise pavitra samaaroh maan kar log us gaay ke chaaron ore ikatthe ho jate hai; use baad main or bhi hairaani hoti he jab uski behosh daadi ko khinch kar log gaay kaa aashirwad dilaane ke liye le jate hai; or vah bhounchakka rah jaataa he jab sthaneey police logon ke is vyavhaar ko protsaahit karti he
 Roshan begins to understand the conflicts and social issues present in the community
 madanagopal kii bahan rama avivaahit he or jayagopal kaa bijli kaa vyapaar nahin chal rahaa he
 Ayyash old old moneylender Lala Bhairam marries a young girl, who is having an affair with Suresh, who runs a young photo studio
 suresh doharaa khel khel rahaa he, vah madanagopal kii beti bittu ke bhi peeche he
 Bittu secretly wants to flee from Old Delhi; She quietly prepares to audition for the popular reality show Indian Idol, hoping to win and open her way to Mumbai
 roshan ali bag kii shahari pasand kii taareef karata he or vah yah jaan kar hairaan ho jaataa he ki ali bag ne kai saal pehle apni maa ko taiyaar kar liya or uske baad se usne kabhi shaadi nahin kii or roshan nichi jati kii kooda binane vaali ladki jalebi ke saath sahanubhuti dikhaata he, jo chuaachhut kaa saamana kar rahi he, ab kuch sthaneey log uske saath ho jate hai
 Roshan crosses the path with the rude Inspector Rannvijay, who persecutes the locals, gets the majority of the local gathering, which is made up of women who demonstrate political ability at every opportunity
 isi bich, media main daraavnee khabaren aane lagati hai jo "kaala bandar " ke aatank se sambandhit hai
 This creature attacks people, steals many things and causes the death of many innocent people
 baharlaal, sthaneey samachar kaale bandar kii har gatividhi par nazar rakhte he or iske karnaamon ke bare main bataate rahete hai
 Jaigopal, who considers himself a genius in electronics, states that a black monkey can be an electric circuit and can be cut with water; This rumor spreads quickly in the area
 film main kai mode aate hai
 After some initial conflict, Roshan and Bittu become closer to each other
 roshan us samay hastkshep karata he jab madanagopal bittu kii shaadi karwaane kii koshish karata he or ladke vaale use dekhne aate hai
 He reveals Bittu's dreams to him; This leaves the boys who have come to see him, and Madangopal gets angry at him
 use dhire dhire bittu se pyaar ho jaataa he, lekin vah us samay bhramit ho jaataa he jab bittu suresh ke liye apane pyaar ko jaahir karti he
 
 isi samay kaala bandar puraani dilli par hamalaa karata he
 Local people with simple thoughts call Tantric Shani Baba to end the demonic influence of the black monkey
 ek lambe havan samaaroh fake baad, tantric baba bataate he ki sthaneey masjid, ko banane ke liye mandir ko dhwast kar diya gaya, isi kaaran kaale bandar kii buree aatma sabko pareshaan kar rahi he
 This creates a sense of enmity between the Hindu and Muslim communities
 praarambhik shantipurna pradarshnon ke baad, kai log bheed main hinsaatmak aacharan karne lagate hai, sthaneey galiyon main hinsa bhadak uthati he
 Mammadu sets fire to the temple of the tree
 roshan shanti banane kii koshish karata he, lekin uske mishrit dharmik pitrutv ke kaaran use asweekruti kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 The locals eventually begin to believe that the black monkey is hidden in a lonely street, and must be destroyed
 ve anaadi gobar ko bure shatru se baalo kaa ek guchha laane kaa nirdesh dete hai taaki tantric ise jala sake or apni bhoot bhagane kii jhaad-phoonk kii prakriya ko puraa kar sake
 Roshan learns that Bittu is planning to elope with Suresh and Suresh is playing a double game
 vah bandar kaa mukhauta or bandar kii poshaak pahan kar chupake se bittu kaa peechha karata hua chat par jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Gobar arrives at Soo Gali where Jalebi gives him a bunch of hair and he returns to bring peace to the community
 usee samay, roshan bittu or suresh ke paas pahunch jaataa he, jisase suresh dar kar bhaag jaataa he
 Before Roshan takes off his mask, Bittu shouts, causing angry people to gather
 unhen lagata he ki roshan hi kaala bandar he, ve uski khub pitayee karte hai or mamdu us par goli chalata he
 Then, Gobar brings the shocking thing about the truth of Kala Bandar, he reveals that Kala Bandar is indeed a problem inhabiting the people of Delhi 6 and people have to defeat it themselves

 hamaari yaaden hamaare vyaktitv kaa ek pramukh ang hai
 What we remember and what we forget depends on a lot of things
 bhashaa, drushti, shravan, pratyakshikaran, adhigam tathaa dhyaan kii tarah smriti bhi mastishk kii ek pramukh bauddhik kshamta he
 Whatever is stored in our brain in the form of experience, information and knowledge, it is all organized in various forms of memory
 maanav mastishk kii is kshamta kaa adhyayan ek kaaphi vyapak vishay vastu he
 It is mainly studied under psychology, neurology and medicine
 prastut aalekh main smriti ke vividh roopon, iske jaivik aadhaar, smriti sambandhi pramukh rog tathaa kuch pramukh smriti yuktiyon par prakaash daalaa jayega
 How does our memory work or how can we remember anything? How is memory stored in our brain? Why do we forget something and forget things
 in moolbhoot prashnon ne maanav man ko sadaa se hi andolit kiya he tathaa inke uttar dene ke samay samay par prayaas bhi kiye gaye hai
 All of us have the ability to remember old things
 ham kisi vyakti, sthaan, ghatana or sthitiyon-paristhitiyon ko yaad karte rahete hai
 Learn something from them
 phir aage unhen anubhavon or gyaan ke rup main surakshit kar lete hai
 The behavior ahead of us is controlled by what we have learned
 prarambh main smriti kii tulana kisi bhautik sthaan se kii jaati thi or usamen sangrahit soochnaaon ko us sthaan main rakhe gaye vibhinn vastuon ke taur par dekha jaataa tha
 An example of a library can be taken to understand this analogy
 pustkaalay ek bhautik sthaan arthath sampurna smriti kaa nirupan karata he or usamen rakhi pustaken vibhinn soochnaaon kii tarah hoti hai
 This interpretation of memory was also recognized for a long time
 lekin baad main tark ke aadhaar par isaki pramanikta par andeh pragat kiya jane laga
 It was observed that this interpretation of memory was correct at the initial stage but it failed to properly explain the different processes of memory such as recall of an old event and creation of new memories
 smriti ko samajhane ke liye or bhi nae siddhant aae
 Of these, the theory inspired by computer science proved to be the most appropriate
 smriti kii is nai vyakhya ko tantrika sanjaal model ke aadhaar par prastut kiya gaya tha
 According to this, memory is distributed in parallel rather than centered in our brain
 yah vitaran sookshm ikaiyaan jo ki tantrika koshika ke samatuly hoti hai, kii bani hoti hai
 In these units, memory is represented as a kind of activation model
 aadhunik paribhaasha ke anusaar hamaari smriti ek samuhik prakram he jiske teen mukhya charan hote hai
 In the first phase, the information is encoded
 iske pashchaat dwitiya charan main in kutabaddh soochnaaon kaa sangrahan hota he or antim tritiy charan main inkaa punassmaran kiya jaataa he
 In order to feel the environment around us, it is necessary that the environmental stimuli are received by the senses related to it
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi vastu ko dekhne ke liye ham us par se paravartit prakaash ko netron dwaara grahan karte hai
 Now this reflected light converts sensory nerve cells present in the retina of the eye into faint electromagnetic waves
 ab yah kaha ja saktaa he ki retina dwaara vaataavaran main upasthit prakaash uddipan kaa kodikaran vaidyutiya rup main kiya gaya
 Now this light electromagnetic wave goes into the visual field of the brain and is explained here
 is vyakhya ke aadhaar par ham apane man main saamne ke drishy kaa ek pratibimb banaate hai
 This entire process is called visual orientation
 koding ke samay suchanaaen mukhyatah sthaan, samay tathaa aavriti ke aadhaar par code kii jaati hai
 After coding the information comes the place of their storage
 yah sangrahan samvedi str yaa alpakaaleen smriti ke str yaa dirghakaalin smriti ke str par ho saktaa he
 It will be noted here that there may be little change in information in our brain at the time of storage
 matlab ki suchanaaen vahiin nahin rahengi jaisi ve vaastavik rup main thim
 We can add something from them or we can remove any part of that information
 agar aadhi adhuri soochna he to ham use apni kalpana shakti ke aadhaar par garh bhi sakate hai
 Due to this property, memory is a formative process
 smriti kaa atirikt str par vargeekaran smriti main soochnaaon ke sangrahan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 How do we know that we have memory of a particular time or place? Only when we remember it
 udhaaharan ke liye agar poocha jaae ki apane bachapan ke paanch shikshakon ke naam bataaie jinaki shikshaaon ne aapke jivan par sabase adhik prabhaav daalaa he to hamen uttar dene main der nahin lagegaa
 But if we ask that the names of Nobel Prize scientists in biology or any field from 2000 to 2005 can be given, then we may have to think for some time
 yah baat yahaan spasht ho jaati he ki ham kin chizon ko yaad rakhte hai or kin chizon ko bhul jate hai yah sab kaaphi kuch hamaari abhipreranaon, chetan or achetan ichchhaaon ityadi par nirbhar karata he
 Hence remembrance is an essential part of total memory
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki smriti ke vibhinn prakramon kii kriyavidhi kya he? smriti kii uparokt prakramon ko samajhane ke liye 1968 main atkinson tathaa siphrine ne smriti kii bahustareey sangrahan kii vyakhya prastut kii
 According to this definition there are three main collections of memory
 hamaari gyanendriyaan kisi bhi soochna ko vaataavaran se grahan karke use mastishk tak pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Later a conclusion is made by the brain based on that information
 ham dekhne, sunne yaa twachaa dwaara sheet yaa garmi kii anubhuti kaa udhaaharan le sakate hai
 Any atmospheric stimulus such as light or sound is first stored in a coded form for a very short period of time in their respective senses
 yah sangrahan atyalp samay ke liye hota he
 Its range of sight is 0
5 seconds and its time limit for hearing is around 2 seconds
 is samay seemaa ke pashchaat is sangrahit smriti kaa kshay ho jaataa he
 Information at the physical level is still preliminary and one cannot draw conclusions from it
 inkaa mastishk dwaara sangyojan tathaa parimarjan abhi baaki hota he
 When the information received by the senses comes to our attention, then they become part of the short term memory
 yahaan ullekhneey he ki samvedi str kii ve sabhi suchanaaen jin par ham dhyaan nahin dete ve samaapt ho jaati hai
 Only those information on which we concentrate become short-term memories
 alpakaaleen smriti ko kriyaatmak smriti bhi kaha jaataa he
 The best example of this type of memory is the recall of a phone number by us
 jab ham kisi number ko dekh kar use dial karte hai to do bate hoti hai
 First we look at the number and remember it by repeating it a few times, then after dialing the number we usually forget it
 atah is prakaar kii smriti ke sambandh main do nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai
 First, the capacity of short-term memory is very low
 Second, if there is a slight decrease in concentration in this type of memory, then our attention is not left
 phone vaale udhaaharan main agar number yaad karne or dial karne ke bich main koi duusari baat ho jaae to hamen number yaad nahin rahegaa
 Scientists have discovered that the total storage of information in this type of memory is only 20 to 30 seconds
 lekin agar soochna ko doharaaya jaae to yah samay 20 se 30 second se adhik bhi ho saktaa he
 And if you repeat it carefully again and again, this information gets converted into long term memory
 jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he dirghakaalin smritiyaan sthai hoti hai
 We use this memory in many ways
 aaj subah hamane naashte main kya khaaya? parason hamaare ghar koun-koun milane aayaa tha? un logon ne koun se kapade pahan rakhe the? hamane apana pichhlaa janmdin kahaan or kaise manaaya tha? ham cycle kaise chalaa lete hai se lekar varg paheli hal karne tak, in sari gatividhiyon main hamaari yah smriti hamaara saath detii he
 This type of memory is the most diverse and our feelings, experiences and knowledge etc
 are reflected in all these forms
 alpakaaleen smriti kii suchanaaen baar-baar duharai jane ke baad dirghakaalin smriti ban jaati hai
 This memory does not decay but may change
 ab tak smriti kii kriyavidhi par baat ho rahi thi
 The question remains as to how our brain stores these information and which activities of the nervous system are responsible for it
 yadi smriti hamaare mastishk main rahati he to iske bhautik nirupan ke kuch pramaan bhi hone chahie
 a lot of research has been done in this direction and many interpretations have also been presented in its context
 yah to aarambh se hi maaloom tha ki smriti nirmaan ke liye jaivik anu hi jimmedaar hote hai
 The first attempt was made in the 1960s to explain it based on the derivation of DNA molecules
 yah bataaya gaya ki smriti ke jaivik nirupan ke liye mrna ke anu jimmedaar hote hai
 It is noteworthy that these mrna molecules are mainly related to our genome messages and protein formation
 baad ke varshon main yah dekha gaya ki smriti ke bhautik aadhaar kii yah pariklpana sahi nahin he or is kshetra main koi bhi vichaar prastut karne ke liye nae avishkaron kii aavashyaktaa he
 The 1970s saw some new ideas regarding the physical representation of memory
 yah bataaya gaya ki mastishk main smriti ksheen vidyutiya tarango ke rup main utpann hoti he or yah kisi tarah se mastishk kii rachana main ati sookshm str par sthai bhautik parivartan karti he
 This physical change represents a new memory
 is vyakhya ke bare main ullekhneey hoga ki yah vibhinn prayogtmak parikshanon par aadhaarit thi or sahi bhi thi
 But here it could not explain how and what the weak electrical waves change structurally
 ” haal ke varshon main hue shodhon se smriti jauviki ke sambandh main nai jaankariyaan mili hai
 According to them, two major factors in memory formation are neural chemistry and nerve cell synapses
 shodhon se is baat ke sanket milte hai ki do tantrika koshikaon main soochna sanvahan ke liye jimmedaar neurotransmeter jo ki synapse dwaara sravit hote he ve kisi vishesh smriti ke liye ek vishesh tantrika praaroop ko baar-baar uttejit karte hai
 As a result a pattern is formed
 anubhavon or baar-baar kiye gaye prayaason se is pattern main thodaa parivartan ho saktaa he
 This pattern is permanent for a particular memory
 duusare shabdon main kahen to hamaare prayek anubhavon, kala, kaushal, smriti aadi ke liye nishchit tantrika praaroop hote hai
 When we think of someone, the format related to it is working
 jab ham koi prashn hal kar rahe hote hai to koi doosraa praaroop sakriy hota he
 We all must have faced a situation at some point when we remember our memory
 udhaaharan ke liye ham kuch kehane ja rahe hon or achaanak hi bhul gaye ki kya kahana he yaa pariksha main prashnptr ke saare uttar aa rahe hon lekin unako likhane ke liye shabd nahin mil paa rahe hai
 These are small examples of memory omission
 duusari ore aapane dekha hoga ki vriddhavastha main kuch logon ko bhuulane kii shikaayat hone lagati he
 There is a story about Einstein that once while he was walking in his university, one of his students asked him for lunch
 ainstine ne usase poocha ki jab aapane mujhe roka tab main kis disha kii ore se aa rahaa tha? vidhyaarthee ne ek ore ishaara kar ke bataaya ki aap us disha kii ore se aa rahe the
 Then Einstein replied
 dhanyavad! tab to maine bhojan kar liya he
 Many such stories are told in relation to philosophers and scientists
 yah chote str par hue smriti lop kaa ek udhaaharan he
 In all of the above events, we see that the smooth functioning of our brain is being hindered from somewhere
 thodi bahut maatra main smriti sambandhi dosha to lagbhag sabhi main hota he lekin ise rog kaa naam nahin diya ja saktaa
 When these symptoms affect the person and the people associated with them, then they give it the name of mementoes
 is prakaar ke rogi keval aadhe ghante pehle mili logon ko yaad nahin rakh pate
 He does not even remember that he had taken bath ten minutes ago
 jivan kii saamaanya kriyaayein bahut hi buree tarah se prabhavit hone lagati hai
 Memory omission or memory corruption is a memory event in which any process related to it is interrupted in memory or storage and as a result our normal memory is affected
 yah baadha kisi bhi shaareerik yaa manovaigyanik kaarnon jaise mastishk kii chot yaa kisi anya kaaran se hui kshati, bimaari, poshak tatwon kii kami, sadamein, atyadhik sharaab ke seven se, nashili dawaaiyon or adhik umr ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Some of the main types of amnesia are described here
 sharaab kaa atyaadhik seven karne vaale logon main iske lakshan dekhne ko milte hai
 Long-term high intake of alcohol causes mainly two problems
 ek to thymin vitamin kii khatarnaak str par kami ho jaati he or duusari, mastishk main kuch hanikaarak sanrachanaatmak parivartan ho jate hai
 As a result of this, memory of patients is badly affected
 aisa dekha gaya he ki inaki vartmaankaal kii smriti to thik hoti he lekin beeti ghatnaon ko yaad nahin rakh pate or bahut si mahatvapurn yaaden inaki smriti se puri tarah se gaayab dikhaai detii hai
 This type of memory error makes it difficult to remember new information, but the memories of the past events are exactly right
 aise udhaaharan dekhne ko milte hai ki kisi ke mastishk ke kisi khaas hisse par chot lag gai ho or uske baad use keval puraani bate yaad rah gai hon or durghatana ke baad kii kisi nai smriti ke liye koi sthaan hi na bachaa ho
 Old symptoms are surprisingly forgotten in its symptoms, but there is no problem in memories related to new events
 aise udhaaharan dekhne ko milte hai ki kisi durghatana ke baad puraani sari yaaden pataa nahin kahaan chali gayi? lekin nai soochnaaon ko yaad rakhane main koi kathinaayee nahin ho rahi he
 In this type of amnesia, memory returns in a few days
 yah dekha gaya he ki kabhi kabhi hamaara man hamen kuch vishesh smritiyon to bhuulane ke liye bhi prerit karata he
 And we also forget them completely
 hamaare vartmaan ko sukhad banane ke liye prakruti dwaara aisi vyavastha kii gai he
 This is especially so in the context of very painful memories
 udhaaharan ke liye balykaal main hui koi dukhad ghatana, dand aadi
 It will be noted here that these memories are lost only by our conscious mind
 kahin gahare achetan main inke ansh vidyaman hote hai
 We see many people around us whose memory capacity is very good
 kuch log aise bhi hote hai jo ki apane bhulakkad swabhaav ke kaaran jane jate hai
 All of us think how good it is when our memory capacity increases
 ek acchhee yaadasht kaa mukhya lakshan he ki yah sabhi sambandhit baton ko krambaddh rup se vyavasthit kare or aavashyaktaa padane par turant hi inaki uplabdhta sunishchit kare
 There are some medicines available which help in severe forgetting
 lekin in dawaaiyon kaa prayog vishesh sthitiyon main hi karnaa chahie
 How well we remember and learn depends a lot on our emotional state
 seekhney or samajhane ke liye preranadayak vaataavaran hameshaa hi laabhprad hota he
 We still learn better when we pay attention
 yah bhi aavashyak he ki soochna ko kis prakaar code kiya ja rahaa he
 How its storage and consolidation is happening and how it is being recalled again
 ek acchhee smriti ke liye in sari kriyaaon kaa sucharu rup se hona aavashyak he
 Memory devices are practical methods by which memory capacity can be increased to an extent
 ham jane anjaane main kinhin chizon ko yaad karne ke liye inkaa prayog bhi karte hai
 It is said of Napoleon that he remembered the name of every officer in his army
 is tarah kii vilakshan smriti kshamta vaale log dikhaai dete hai jinhen bahut saare varshon kaa panchang yaad rahata he
 Now the question arises that what is the difference between the way a normal person remembers and the ways of a specific memory person? Research has shown that the method of codification, collection and recall of information may vary slightly among individuals
 ek acchhee smriti yaa to janmajaat pratibha ho sakati he yaa baad main saadhaaran logon dwaara bhi kuch vishesh vidhiyon kaa prayog kar ke sikhi ja sakati he
 The process of memory is slightly complex in people with a congenital high memory capacity
 aisa dekha gaya he ki aise logon me kuch ke paas sinesthesia ke lakshan bhi hote hai
 To explain synesthesia, it can be said that such people listen to the sound as well as listen to the visuals as well
 atah kuch dekhne ke liye ve mastishk kii drishy kshamta ke saath-saath shravan kshamta kaa bhi prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, a soft mellow sound can also be a group of beautiful colors for them and darker piercing colors for a harsh sound
 sinesthesia ke lakshan or bhi samvedi kshamtaaon jaise sparsh, ghran ityadi ke liye bhi ho sakate hai
 Many other memory devices are also used to make memory effective
 jaise pehle se sangrahit smriti ko nai soochna se jod kar yaad karnaa, samaan soochnaaon ko ek saath rakh kar yaad karnaa, kisi bhi soochna ko ruchikar katha ke rup main badal kar yaad karnaa ityadi
 Another method SQ3R is very useful for understanding complex textual content
 isamen pehle paathya saamagree kaa man main ek khaakaa taiyaar karte hai, phir khud se hi us par “kya, kyon or kaise” aadhaarit kuch prashn banaate hai
 Now keeping these questions in mind, the textual content is read carefully and then read it again in sequence
 ant main pathak dwaara isaki samiksha kii jaati he
 Good mental and physical health is essential for good memory
 iske saath hi jo padhaa ja rahaa he usase bhaavnaatmak lagaav bhi aavashyak he
 Some concentration enhancing methods such as meditation and pranayama etc
 have also proved very useful in increasing the capacity of memory

 Chamtauli is a village in Chamoli district of Garhwal division under the state of Uttarakhand in Joshimath tehsil of India
 yah tehsil maharajaganj jila, uttar pradesh main sthit he
 According to Census of India in 2011, there are 234 villages in this tehsil
 tantrikoshika yaa tantrika koshika tantrika tantra main sthit ek uttejneey koshika he
 The function of this cell is to exchange and analyze information from the brain
 yah kaary ek vidyut-rasinic sanket ke dwaara hota he
 Nerve cells are the major parts of the nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and peripheral gangilla
 kai tarah ke vishisht tantrika koshika hote hai jisamen sensori tantrika koshika, antartantrika koshika or gatijanak tantrika koshika hote hai
 These nerve cells only react when something touches something, sound or light, and sends its signals to the spinal cord and brain
 motor tantrika koshika mastishk or meru rajju se sanket grahan karte hai
 Muscle contraction and glands are affected by this
 ek saamaanya or saadhaaran tantrika koshika main ek koshika yani soma, dendrite or karrwai hote hai
 The main part of a nerve cell is the soma
 tantrika koshika ko uski sanrachana ke aadhaar par bhi vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 It is unipolar, bipolar and multipolar
 tantrika koshika main koshikeey vibhaajan nahin hota he jisase iske nasht hone par dubaara praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But it can be obtained by stem cells
 aisa bhi dekha gaya he ki asthikanika ko tantrika koshika main badla ja saktaa he
 The term nerve cell was first used by German physiologist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldair
 20veen shatabdi main pehali baar tantrika koshika prakaash main ai jab centigyo reman kejal ne bataaya ki yah tantrika tantra kii praathmik prakaarya ikai hoti he
 Kejal proposed that nerve cells are separate cells that communicate with each other through a specific junction
 tantrika koshika kii sanrachana kaa adhyayan karne ke liye kejal ne camilo golgi dwaara banaae gaye silver staning tareeke kaa prayog kiya
 The number of nerve cells in the brain varies by species
 ek akalan ke mutabik maanav mastishk main 100 arab tantrika koshika hote hai
 Research at the University of Toronto has identified a probene that plays an important role in the development of nerves in the brain
 is probhujin kii sahaayta se mastishk kii karypranali ko or samajhnaa bhi saral hoga va aljamrars jaise rogon ke kaaran bhi khoje ja sakenge
 This probogen, called SR-100, is found in the capillary region as well as it regulates the genes that make up the nervous system
 ek amareeki jaranal sell main prakashit bayaan ke anusaar stanadhariyon ke mastishk main vibhinn jeenon dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye anuvaanshik sandeshon ke vaahan ko niyantrit karata he
 The purpose of this study was to discover genes that regulate nerve cell formation in the brain
 aanse main tantrika koshika ke nirmaan main is probhujin kii mahatvapurn bhoomika kii khoj tantrika koshika ke vikaas main hone vaali kai apasaamanyataon se bachaa sakati he
 According to scientists, during the construction of nerve cells in the brain, some incorrect messages affect the formation of nerve cells from the vehicle
 tantrika koshika kaa vikrut hona alzimers jaisi bimariyon ke kaaran bhi hota he
 After the discovery of this probujin, possibilities of diagnosis have arisen in this direction

 Rust programming language helps you to write faster, more reliable software
 aksar programing bhashaaon me likhne kii suvidha or nimna-str par niyantran karne me sangharsh hota he
 Rust challenges this conflict
 rast apko memory ke upyog kaa niyantran jaise nimna str ke kary bhi karne detaa he, lekin bina usse jubie hue paaramparik paresaniyon ke
 For a lot of people
 kuch udhaaharan dekhte he
 It is being established that Rast is a very good tool for a large group of programmers, who have a low level of skill to many levels of skill
 nimna-str par likhe gaye kong, kai prakaar ke jatil galatiyon ke liye liye pravan hai
 They can be caught only by investigating experienced programmers
 lekin rast main compiler hiaise kai galtiyaan pakad letaa he, or kong ko compyle hi nahi karta
 In this way, the programmer can spend his time, more in the logic of the program and less in finding mistakes
