 In parasitic organisms, the body segment has disappeared and the shape of the body has also changed completely
 iskaa udhaaharan rizosephala he, jisamen kathini ke lakshan to kya, sandhipad jeevon kaa bhi koi lakshan praudhavastha main nahin dikhaai detaa
 Difficult creatures are mainly forest dwellers
 is kaaran anumaan kiya jaataa he ki is varg ke purvaj kaa sharir samaan khandon main vibhajit tha or prayek khand par ek jodi ang jude the
 Each of their components used to do all the work together like circulation, food, respiration and knowledge
 trilobita main avyavon kii aisi hi vyavastha maani gai he, parantu yah upvarg lupt ho gaya he
 So far in the modern difficulty, no such organism has been found, whose ingredients are with these four functions
 iske sir ke ang to bhinn-bhinn vishesh kaaryon ke liye upyukt hote hai, parantu brankiopoda ke dhad ke avyav ek samaan hote hai or kuch seemaa tak mana ja saktaa he ki inase chaaron kaary hote hai
 Otherwise, the feature of limbs has advanced in difficulty by many measures, because it is known that the organs which do one task in some difficulty, do the other tasks in the other difficulty
 kathini ke bheetar kaa vikaas mukhyat: in angon ke hi kartavya main niyantran par aadhaarit he
 No matter how hard the components are used for any task and no matter how different in size, their composition is mainly bicameral
 prayek avyav kaa aadhaarit vrutt dwikhandi hota he or ise sympod yaa protopodit kehete hai or iske upree khand se do shakhaayen endopodit or exopotide nikalati hai
 This type of root based ingredient is called Steinopodium
 aise saadhaaran dwishakhi avyav kopipod ke plavan pad, mailocostraca ke udar ang ityadi hai or aise hi ang purvaj dimbh main bhi, jise nopleius kehete hai, paae jate hai
 Similar elements take different forms for special tasks in other difficult organisms
 kathini ke netra do prakaar ke hote hai madhyam tathaa sanyukt netra
 Very simple middle eye noplias and many adults live in hardships, but in malacostraca they disappear and the combined eye is the working eye
 sanyukt netra praaia: ek jodi hote hai, jo kuch jeevon ke avrunt or kai ek main vrintyukt rahete hai
 The eye is considered to be a component of the head, but it is suspicious
 kaaran, parivardhan main yah duusare angon main bahut pashchaat udit hote hai
 The first horns, which remain in front of the mouth, are considered components of the second section
 yah nopleius tathaa sab upjatiyon ke jeevon main, keval mailocostraca ke atirikt, ekasakhi hoti hai
 Their main function is sensor, but in many eggs and adult difficulties they also come in the function of flotation and many males also capture the female from the ring
 siropedia main cement grathiyon ke chhidr inhen avyavon par hote hai, jinaki sahaayta se inke vayask sthagit hote hai
 Although the second horn is located in front of the mouth, it was actually located behind the mouth
 nopleius main iskaa sthaan mukh ke parshv main rahata he or yah bhojan ko mukh kii ore laane main sahaayta detii he
 The rest of its work is similar to the first ring
 melacostraca main isaki ek shakha bahusandhimaan kashang ke aakaar kii hoti he or iskaa kaary keval samvedan grahan he, parantu duusari shakha kaa aakaar chapate patt ke samaan hota he or yah plavan main santolan kaa kaary bhi karti he
 In Noplius and Vyaska Kopipoda, Isopoda, etc
, the adjoins are bicellular and help in feeding, but in many difficulties, the adjoins form the shape of Hanu and their surface is equipped with teeth and condoms
 parashrayi kathini ke adhohanu bedhan ke liye nalaakaar shund ke sadrush hote hai
 The protuberant and subalpine, or first and second maxillae, are always flattened like leaves, and the branches of Hanu are situated on their branches
 ye teenon mukh ke pichhali hanu hai
 In the posterior parts of the head, there is no particular difference among the bronchiopoda, copipoda etc
 and these organs are mainly similar
 inkaa aakaar melacostraca ke upjanbhak or upasambh main miltaa-julata hota he
 These types of ingredients are called filopodia
 parantu melacostraca ke dhad ke angon ko do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he-aath jodi vaksh ke avyav tathaa chah jodi udar ke avyav 
 They are completely different from each other
 vaksh ke avyav mukhyat: gati karne ke kaam main aate hai or isi kaaran inke endopodide, jo is kaary main pramukh bhaag lete hai, usee prakaar parivirtat ho jate hai, parantu inke exopodide, jo plavan main upyogi hote hai, inamen lupt ho gaye hai
 Before the thorax one or two pairs of components are often pectoral shaped, due to which they are named Anupada
 udar ke ang sadaa dwishakhi or plavan main upyogi hai
 The tail helps the organism in a special way by reversing the shape of the tail of the tail with the help of the last abdomen
 adhiktar nimna kathini sharital se saans lete hai, parantu jin jeevon kaa bahi:kankal adhik kathor ho gaya he ve shwasan kaary apane un sharirsthanon se karte hai jahaan kaa tal ksheen rah gaya he, jaise kairapes kaa astr; athwa yah kaam vishesh indriyon dwaara hota he, jinako jalashvasanika kehete hai
 Water reservoirs are the branches on the chest or its limbs, which are flattened in shape and whose blood flows within the microscopic walls
 decapoda main jalshvanikaaye apni sthiti ke aadhaar par teen shreniyon main rakhi gai hai-vakshangamul kii shakhikaaye, vakshaangon ke sameep kii shakhikaaye tathaa brankial mandal bhitari bhaag jo kerapes se dhake rahete hai
 Thalanivasi hardships, such as crabs, etc
, are well adapted to respiration — the floor of the lining of their brachial system acts as a lung
 anya jeevon main, jaise isopoda, kashthauka ityadi main, udarangon main shakhavinyast vaayu bhari nalikaay pai jaati hai, jo keet tathaa anya sthaljivon kii shwasanaliyon ke samaan hoti hai
 In difficulties, the alimentary canal is always straight throughout the body from front to end
 parantu is varg ke kuch aise jeev bhi hai jinamein yah nyudeshtit athwa kundalit bhi pai jaati he
 Like other arthropod organisms, it too is divided into three parts
 agrantra tathaa pashchantra, jinke chhidr mukh tathaa guda hai or jinka aantarik tal kytin se, jo bahya sharir ke kytin ke saath sanlagn rahata he, aachhadit rahete hai
 The third part is the middle, which lives between them
 agrantra kii peshiyaan prabal hoti hai or inke antareey tal par bal, kaante tathaa daant ityadi viksit rahete hai
 In Melacostraca, this part forms the stomach, in which gastric, gizzard and filtration equipment are special means to separate food juices from particles
 parantu peshni tathaa chanani praaia: hrideey tathaa nizthreey vibhaagon main pruthak rahete hai
 At the front end of the mid-intestine, there are a pair or more of liver cells whose functions are absorption and secretion and out of which branch can also form liver
 decapoda main yakrut granthi praaia: saare aavashyak enzim banaati he or saath apni guha se vanchit padaarthon kaa shoshan bhi karti hai
 In this, food is stored in the form of glycogen
 kuch decapoda main madhyantra bahut choti hoti he jiske kaaran aaharanlee keval agr tathaa pasch antra kii bani vidit hoti he
 In parasitic difficult organisms, the food pipe is either nominal or it is absolutely lacking
 anya sandhipad jeevon kii bhanti kathiniyon main bhi rudhir sharirguha tathaa gantikaon main pravaahit hota he
 Like other arthropods, the heart is also located within the posterior cardiovascular cavity
 brankiopoda, austracada tathaa kuch melacostraca main hriday praaia: sharir kii puri lambaai ke baraabar hota he or sharir ke antim bhaag khand ke atirikt prayek khand main isamen ek jodi kapatyut andhra hota he, jo hridayaavaran se ja miltaa he
 In other difficulties, the heart length is usually less
 dhamniyaan hriday se nikalakar rudhirsthanon main khulti hai, jahaan se rudhir sharir ke prayek bhaag tathaa ang se hota hua hridayaavaran main aata he
 The reservoir is located in this part to oxygenate the blood
 anek kathini aise bhi hai jinamein hriday nahin hota, jaise siripedia, kopipoda ityadi or inamen rudhiravahan sharir tathaa aharnali ke sanchaalan kii sahaayta se hota he
 Difficulties are the bloody fluid in which leukocyte is added and hemoglobin is also present in Entomestraca
 kathini kii mukhya utsarjan indriyaan shringika sambandhi tathaa upbhanj sambandhi do jodi granthiyaan hai jo inhen naamon ke angon ke aasthaanon par khulti hai
 The complete development of both the glands is never found together in one stage of any caste, so in different stages in the history of life, one after the other is functioning
 udaahranarth, jhinge tathaa duusare dashapadon kii vayask avasthaa main shringika sambandhi granthi kaaryshil hoti he or inke dimbh main upasambh sambandhi
 But most of the difficulties have the opposite situation
 inamen in donon grathiyon kii rachana ek samaan hoti he
 Each gland has three main parts: 1
 Antune, which is a remnant of the dehgue and a dilapidated inner part, 2
 Excretory canal and 3
 Altered exit system, which is connected to the antune and one part of which is the excitatory tube of adenoid wall
 
 utsargi nalika kaa adhar bhaag tathaa bahirgaman pranali donon badi hokar sangrahi mutrashay banaati hai
 The normal form of the central nervous system is also similar to other arthropod organisms
 mastishk kaa sanyog pratiprushthiya tantrikaraju ke saath parigrasika sanyojak ke dwaara rahata he
 The anterograde neuralgia is a double chain of tufts that are joined together by aggregates and joints
 praaia: chaar jodi bhruneey gucchhikaaye aapas main milakar mastishk banaati hai or netra gucchhika bhi isi main sammilit he
 In difficulty, in the state of the nervous system, there is a complete range from the ideal condition of the arthropods to the very concentric condition
 aadim brankiopoda main pratiprishth gucchhikaaon kii shrinkhalaa sidhiyon ke aakaar kii hoti he jaisi kuch enilidz main pai jaati he or jisamen shrinkhalaa ke donon bhaag ek duusare se pruthak rahete hai
 In other difficult groups, the two parts of the chain are often reconciled, as well as the flakes coming close to each other
 is shrenee kii antim dasha main, jo kekadon main pai jaati he, keval gucchhikaaon kaa ek samooh hi dikhaai detaa he
 Like independent and active organisms, the sexes are often different in difficulty, but the organisms of cirrpedia and many parasitic isopodas are also bisexual
 ye purvapumpakv hote hai jinamein pulling angon kaa parivardhan streeling angon se pehle hota he
 The micro-complementary males in seripedia, like parasites, often cling to ordinary or hermaphrodites of this caste, because their male parts cannot fully conceive
 anek brankiopoda tathaa austracoda main anishek janan bhi hota he
 Sexual dimorphism is also commonly found in them
 nar main maadaa ko pakadaney ke liye vishesh ang bhi rahete hai, jo sharir ke kisi bhaag se samparivartit hokar is kaary ke liye upyogi ho jate hai
 Males are often larger than females in higher tentacles, but in other groups the arrangement is the opposite
 donon lingon ke jananpind sadaa ek jodi naal indriyaan hoti hai, jo aaharanlee ke prishth par ek duusare se judi rahati hai
 They can also be simple or branched and ducts arise from them and often open outwards from the middle of the body
 siripedia main or kuch cladosira ke nar main yah chhidr sharir kii seemaa par rahete hai, parantu inaki maadaa main yah chhidr vaksh ke pratham khand par sthit rahete hai or melacostraca main bhi donon lingon main chhidr isi sthaan par rahete hai
 The eggs that are available in large numbers from the difficulty of the egg are completely different from the adult
 vayask avasthaa dhaaran karne ke purv jeev ko vibhinn dimbhon kii ek shrenee paar kerani padati hai jisamen pratham dimbh noples larva kehalaata he
 Each difficulty crosses this stage, whether it arises in a free flowered state or in embryonic form
 praroopik avasthaa main yah dimbh akhandit andakaar hota he, jisamen teen jodi avyav rahete hai or jo vayask ke antenulz, anteni or medibalz ban jate hai
 Its first pair are bicellular, and all of them help the noplus to float
 dwishakhi avyav bhojan ko mukh main pahunchaane kaa kaary bhi karte hai
 In front of its mouth, there is a large eardrum
 dimbh ke antra ke teenon bhaag agrantra, madhyantra tathaa pashchantra rahete hai
 In Astracoda, nauplius converges at the time of ovulation, as the bivalve caropase is amplified
 nimna jati ke kathiniyon main nopleius kaa parivartan kramash: hota he, jisamen khand ek-ek karke, peeche se aage, antim khand main judate jate hai
 Then the components begin to arise in these segments
 is prakaar isaki avasthaa anya roopon main paraveertit ho jaati he gimen metanopleius, cypris, zoiya, fillosoma, megalopa ityadi ullekhneey hai
 Mostly, all these stages are independent Talplavi
 keval alvan jal ke prachingt tathaa nadiyon ke jhinge hi aise jeev hai jinke parivardhan main vishesh roopaantar nahin hota
 In the composition of organisms of this class, there is more diversity than other classes
 is kaaran inkaa vargeekaran, jisamen aapas kii samaantaaon par vishesh dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he, ati jatil he
 This class is divided into the following subclasses with which the names of their main ganas are also inscribed: upvarg : brankiopoda- Gana: Anostraca, Notostraca, Conocostraca and Cladocera
 upvarg : austracoda- Gan: Miodocopa and Podacopa upvarg : kapipoda- Gan: Cyclopaedia, Lerniopodidea, Caligida, Kellenida etc
 upvarg : brancura- Gan: Argulidea
 upvarg : siripedia- Gana: Thoracica, Acrothoracica, Ascothoracica, Apoda and Roisocephala
 upvarg : melacostraca- Department: Filocerida - Gunn: Nibeneli vibhaag : sincrida -gana : enaspedesia Departments: Peracarida - Humans: Mycidacea, Comesia, Tanidesia, Isopoda and Amphipoda
 vibhaag : eukereda -gana : yuphossiesia tathaa decapoda 
 Department: hoplocarida-gum: Stomatopoda

 maharaj ko jab yah baat pataa chali to unhone bodha ko chah maheene ke deshnikale kii sajaa de di
 In the disconnection of the prostitute, Bodha wrote a book called Virahvarish
 chah maheene baad rajdurbar main hajir hue to maharaj ne poocha - "kahiye kaviraj! akal thikaane aayi? in dinon kuch likhaa kya?" is par bodha ne apni pustak virahavarish ke kuch kavitt sunaaye
 Maharaj said - "lots of adornment has been done, now tell me about some policy
 " is par bodha ne ek chand kaha- Hill Milli knows that for the life of the Milli Mill, do not know the interest so do not disturb the interest

 Official trailer of 'azhar' gregorian calendar {gregory kaaldarshak}, duniya main lagbhag har jagah upyog kiya jane vaala kaaldarshak yaa tithipatrak he
 This is the adaptation of the Julian calendar
 ise pope gregory ne lagu kiya tha
 Prior to this, the Julian calendar was in vogue, but it contained many errors, which were corrected in the Gregorian calendar
 gregory kaaldarshak kii mul ikai din hota he
 There is a year of 365 days, but every fourth year is of 366 days, which is called leap year
 surya par aadhaarit panchang har 146,097 dinon baad doharaaya jaataa he
 It is divided over 400 years and equals 20871 weeks
 in 400 varshon main 303 varsh aam varsh hote hai, jiname 365 din hote hai
 And there are 97 leap years, consisting of 366 days
 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not
 is naveen paddati kaa aarambh chunki pope gregory ne kiya, isliye isko gregorian paddati athwa naveen paddati kaha gaya
 This method was accepted in different Christian countries in different years
 isse in deshon kaa itihaas padhate samay is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD
 punah 2000 i0 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hone ke kaaran yah vruddhi 13 din kii hi rahegi, atirikt 1 din nahin badhegaa
 886 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 886 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he

 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he

 Presently, the dominance of English journalism in Hindi journalism has been abolished
 pehle desh-videsh main angreji patrakarita kaa dabadabaa tha lekin aaj hindi bhashaa kaa jhandaa chanhudish laharaa rahaa he
 May 30 is celebrated as 'hindi Journalism Day'
 bharatvarsh main aadhunik dhang kii patrakarita kaa janm atharahavin shatabdi ke chaturth charan main kalakatta, bombai or madras main hua
 Hicke's "calcutta Gazette", published in 1780 AD, was perhaps the first attempt in this direction
 hindi ke pehle patr udant maartand ke prakashit hone tak in nagaron kii angloindian angreji patrakarita kaaphi viksit ho gai thi
 In these last years, journalism was also born in the Persian language
 18veen shatabdi ke farsi patr kadachit hastlikhit patr the
 In the compilation titled 'hindusthan Intelligence Oriental Anthology' published in 1801, there were quotes from how many "newspapers" in North India
 1810 main maulavee ikraam ali ne kalakatta se litho patr "hindostani" prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya
 In 1816 Gangakishore Bhattacharya introduced the "bengal Gazette"
 yah pehla bangala patr tha
 Later priests of Shrirampur gave birth to the famous propaganda "samachar Darpan"
 in praarambhik patron ke baad 1823 main hamen banglaa bhashaa ke 'samacharchandrika' or "samvaad kaumudi", farsi urdu ke "jaame jahannuma" or "shamsul akhbaar" tathaa gujarati ke "mumbai samachar" ke darshan hote hai
 It is clear that Hindi journalism is not much later
 dilli kaa "urdu akhbaar" or marathi kaa "digdarshan" hindi ke pehle patr "udant martand" ke baad hi aae
 The editor of "udant Martand" was Pandit Jugalkishore
 yah saptahik patr tha
 The language of the letter used to be Pachhihi Hindi, which the editors of the letter called "madhya Pradesh language"
 yah patr 1827 main band ho gaya
 In those days it was impossible to carry any letter without government assistance
 company sarkaar ne mishnariyon ke patr ko dak aadi kii suvidha de rakhi thi, parantu cheshtaa karne par bhi "udant martand" ko yah suvidha praapt nahin ho saki
 From 1826 AD to 1873 AD, we can call the first phase of Hindi journalism
 1873 i
 main bharatendu ne "harishchandra magazine" kii sthapana kii
 a year later the letter became famous as "harishchandra Chandrika"
 vaise bharatendu kaa "kavivachan sudhaa" patr 1867 main hi saamne aa gaya tha or usne patrakarita ke vikaas main mahatvapurn bhaag liya tha; parantu nai bhashastyli kaa pravartan 1873 main "harishchandra magazine" se hi hua
 Most of the letters in the meantime can only be called experiments and there is no knowledge of journalism behind them or the spirit of propagating new ideas
 "udant martand" ke baad pramukh patr hai : Some of these letters were monthly, some weekly
 dainik patr keval ek tha "samachar sudhavarshan" jo dwibhashiya tha or kalakatta se prakashit hota tha
 This daily paper continued till 1871
 adhikansh patr agra se prakashit hote the jo un dinon ek bada shikshacendre tha or vidhyaarthismaj kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti karte the
 The rest were related to Brahmasamaja, Sanatana Dharma and missionary work
 bahut se patr dwibhashiya the or kuch to panchabhaashiya tak the
 This also informs the immature condition of journalism
 hindipradesh ke praarambhik patron main "banaras akhbaar" kaaphi prabhaavshaalee tha or usee kii bhashaniti ke virodh main 1850 main taramohan maitra ne kaashi se saptahik "sudhakar" or 1855 main raja lakshmanasingh ne agra se "prajahitaishi" kaa prakaashan aarambh kiya tha
 When King Shivaprasad's "banaras Newspaper" adopted the Urdu language style, both these letters tended towards the Panditau Tasampradhan style
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki 1867 se pehle bhashastyli ke sambandh main hindi patrkaar kisi nishchit style kaa anusaran nahin kar sake the
 This year 'kavi Vedasudha' was published and in a way we can call it the first important letter
 pehle yah masik tha, phir pakshik hua or ant main saptahik
 Bhartendu's multiple personality was published through this paper, but the truth is that till the publication of "harishchandra Magazine", he too appears to find a path in the field of language and ideas
 hindi patrakarita kaa doosraa yug 1873 se 1900 tak chalata he
 At one end of this era was Bharatendu's "harishchandra Magazine" and "saraswati", approved by the Nagri Pracharini Sabha
 in 27 varshon main prakashit patron kii sankhya 300-350 se upar he or ye nagpur tak faile hue hai
 Most of the letters were monthly or weekly
 masik patron main niabandh, naval katha, vaarta aadi ke rup main kuch adhik sthaayee sampatti rahati thi, parantu adhikansh patr 10-15 prishthon se adhik nahin jate the or unhen ham aaj ke shabdon main "vichaarpatr" hi kah sakate hai
 News and commentaries also had an important place in the weekly papers
 vastav main dainik samachar ke prati us samay vishesh aagrah nahin tha or kadachit isiilie un dinon saptahik or masik patr kahin adhik mahatvapurn the
 He took a very important part in the public awakening
 unnisvin shatabdi ke in 25 varshon kaa adarsh bharatendu kii patrakarita thi
 Bharatavandu as "kavikavashasudha", "harishchandra Magazine", Sri Harishchandra Chandrika ", Balabodhini, pioneered this direction
 unki tikatippaniyon se adhikri tak ghabaraate the or "kavivachansudha" ke "panch" par rusht hokar kaashi ke magistrate ne bharatendu ke patron ko shiksha vibhaag ke liye lenaa bhi band kara diya tha
 There is no doubt that even in the field of journalism, Bharatendu was completely fearless and encouraged new letters
 "hindi pradeep", "bharatjivan" aadi anek patron kaa namakaran bhi unhone hi kiya tha
 All the journalists of his era considered him a pioneer
 bharatendu ke baad is kshetra main jo patrkaar aae unamem pramukh the pandit rudradutt sharma,, baalkrishna bhatta, durgaaprasad mishra, pandit sadanand mishra, pandit vanshidhar, badrinarayan choudhary "premadhan", devakinandan treepathi, radhacharan goswami, pandit gauridatt, raaj rampal singh, pratapanarayan mishra, ambikadutt vyas,, babu ramakrishna verma, pan

 In 1895, the publication of "nagri Prapacharini Patrika" begins
 is patrika se gambhir sahityasamiksha kaa aarambh hua or isliye ham ise ek nishchit prakashastambh maan sakate hai
 With the revision of "saraswati" and "sudarshan" in 1900 AD, this second era of Hindi journalism comes under fire
 in 25 varshon main hindi patrakarita anek dishaao main viksit hui
 Initial letters were limited to teaching and preaching
 bharatendu ne saamaajik, raajnneetik or saahitiyik dishaaen bhi viksit kin
 He was the first woman to run a monthly letter called "balabodhini"
 kuch varsh baad mahilaon ko swayan is kshetra main utarate dekhte hai - "bharatbhagini", "sugruhinee" 
 Aryasamaj and Sanatan Dharma preachers were particularly active in the field of religion in these years
 brahmsamaj or radhaswami mat se sambandhit kuch patr or mirzapur jaise isai kendron se kuch isai dharm sambandhi patr bhi saamne aate hai, parantu yug kii dharmik pratikriyaaon ko ham aryasamaj ke or puranikon ke patron main hi pate hai
 Today these letters may not seem so important, but there is no doubt that they reinforced the prose style of Hindi and also sparked new ideas in public
 in dharmik vadavivaadon ke falswaroop samaaj ke vibhinn varg or sampradaay sudhaar kii ore agrasar hue or bahut sheeghra hi sampradayik patron kii baadh aa gai
 Hundreds of different ethnic and class papers were published and he spoke to innumerable people
 aaj vahi patr hamaari itihaetana main vishesh mahatvapurn hai jinhone bhashaa style, sahitya athwa raajnneeti ke kshetra main koi apratim kaary kiya ho
 Literally "hindi Pradeep", Brahmin, Kshatriya Patrika, Anandakadambini, Bharatendu, Devanagari Preacher, Vaishnav Patrika, Poet painter, Nagari Neerad, Sahitya Sudhanidhi and politically Bharatamitra, proper speaker, Sara Sudhanidhi, Bharatodaya, India life, Bharatodaya, Well-wishers and Hindi Bangwasis are particularly important
 in patron main hamaare 19veen shatabdi ke sahityarsikon, hindi ke karmath upaskon, shaileekaron or chintakon kii sarvshereshth nidhi surakshit he
 It is a matter of anger that we could not save this important material from the files of letters
 baalkrishna bhatta, pratapanarayan mishra, sadaanan mishra, rudradutt sharma, ambikadutt vyas or balmukund gupt jaise sajiv lekhakon kii kalam se nikle hue na jane kitne niabandh, tippanee, lekh, panch, haas parihaas aup sketch aaj main hamen alabhya ho rahe hai
 Even today our journalists can learn a lot from them
 apane samay main to ve agrani the hi
 Twentieth-century journalism is relatively close to us, and much of the diversity and polymorphism of journalism is found in it
 19veen shatee ke patrakaron ko bhashaa-shailishetra main avyavashtha kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He had to place his object in front of letters in English and Urdu on the other hand
 abhi hindi main ruchi rakhanevaali janata bahut choti thi
 Gradually the situation changed and we find Hindi papers leading in the field of literature and politics
 is shatabdi se dharm or samajasudhar ke andolan kuch peeche pad gaye or jaateey chetana ne dhire-dhire rashtriya chetana kaa rup grahan kar liya
 As a result, most of the papers went with literature and politics
 saahitiyik patron ke kshetra main pehle do dashakon main acharya dvivedi dwaara sampadit "saraswati" kaa netritv rahaa
 In fact, in these twenty years, the monthly letters of Hindi emerged as a great literary force
 shrunkhalit upanyaas kahani ke rup main kai patr prakashit hue - jaise upanyaas 1901, hindi navil 1901, upanyaas lahari 1902, upanyasasagar 1903, upanyaas kusumanjali 1904, upanyasbahar 1907, upanyaas prachaar 19012
 Many letters began to come out in the last years of the nineteenth century with only poetry or problematics
 ve chale rahe
 Publication of "critic" and "history" related to historical research are also important events in the field of criticism
 parantu saraswati ne "mislani" ke rup main jo adarsh rakhaa tha, vah adhik lokapriy rahaa or is shrenee ke patron main uske saath kuch thode hi patron kaa naam liya ja saktaa he, jaise "bharatendu", nagari hitaishini patrika, bankipur, nagariprachaarak, mithilamihir or indu 
 Both "saraswati" and "indu" are important for the history of Hindi literature and in a way we can call them the apex of literary journalism of that era
 "saraswati" ke madhyam se acharya mahaviraprasad dvivedi or "indu" ke madhyam se pandit rupanarayan pandeya ne jis sampadakeey satarkta, adhyavsaay or eemaandaaree kaa adarsh hamaare saamne rakhaa vah hindi patrakarita ko ek nai disha dene main samarth hua
 But Hindi journalism could not get leadership in political field
 pichley yug kii raajnneetik patrakarita kaa centre kalakatta tha
 But Calcutta used to stay away from Hindi region and Hindi state itself got a conscious leadership in political direction in a short time
 hindi pradesh kaa pehla dainik raja rampalasinh kaa dwibhashiya "hindustan" he jo angreji or hindi main kalaakankar se prakashit hota tha
 Two years later, Babu Sitaram started extracting a daily letter called "bharatodaya" from Kanpur
 parantu ye donon patr dirghajivi nahin ho sake or saptahik patron ko hi raajnneetik vichaardhaara kaa vaahan bananaa padaa
 In fact, in the nineteenth century, Bharat Mitra, Vangwasi, Sarasudhanidhi and proper speaker of Calcutta represented the royal spirit of the Hindi state
 inamen kadachit "bharatamitra" hi sabase adhik sthaayee or shaktishaalee tha
 In the nineteenth century, Bengal and Maharashtra were centers of folk awakening and these provinces were also pioneers in radical national journalism
 hindi pradesh ke patrakaron ne in praanton ke netritv ko sweekaar kar liya or bahut dinon tak unka swatantra raajnneetik vyaktitv viksit nahin ho sakaa
 Nevertheless, we find many advances in Hindi political journalism in the form of "abhyudaya", "pratap", "karmayogi", "hindi Kesari" etc
 pratham mahayuddh kii uttejnaa ne ek baar phir kai dainik patron ko janm diya
 "calcutta News", "swatantra" and "vishwamitra" were published from Calcutta, "venkateswara Samachar" from Bombay started publishing its daily edition and "vijay" came out from Delhi
 1921 main kaashi se "aaj" or kanpur se "vartmaan" prakashit hue
 Thus we see that in 1921 Hindi journalism once again takes turns and starts its new life in the political arena
 hamaare saahitiyik patron ke kshetra main bhi nai pravritiyon kaa aarambh isi samay se hota he
 As a result, the first twenty years of the twentieth century can be called the third phase of Hindi journalism
 1921 ke baad hindi patrakarita kaa samasamyik yug aarambh hota he
 In this era, we find national and literary consciousness flourishing together
 isi samay ke lagbhag hindi kaa pravesh vishvavidhyalayon main hua or kuch aise kriti sampadak saamne aae jo angreji kii patrakarita se purnat: parichit the or jo hindi patron ko angreji, marathi or banglaa ke patron ke samakaksh laana chaahate the
 As a result, a new era in literary journalism began
 rashtriya andolanon ne hindi kii rashtrabhasha ke liye yogyata pehali baar ghoshit kii ore jaise-jaise rashtriya andolanon kaa bal badhane laga, hindi ke patrkaar or patr adhik mahatv paane lage
 After 1921, the national movement under Gandhiji's leadership did not remain confined to the middle class and reached the villagers and workers, and in this spread Hindi journalism gave significant additions
 sach to yah he ki hindi patrkaar rashtriya andolanon kii agr pankti main the or unhone videshi satta se datakar morcha liya
 Many times the foreign government fudged the freedom of newspapers by enacting new laws, but in spite of jail, fines and many mental and economic difficulties, Hindi journalists lit the lamp of free thought
 1921 ke baad sahityakshetra main jo patr aae unamem pramukh hai- In fact, there can be no doubt in the maturity and diversity of our monthly literature
 hindi kii anekanek pratham shrenee kii rachanaayen masikon dwaara hi pehle prakaash main ai or anek shreshth kavi or sahityakar patrakarita se bhi sambandhit rahe
 Today, our monthly letters cover all the parts of life and literature and now attention is also being paid to expertise
 sahitya kii pravritiyon kii jaisi vikasman jhalak patron main milti he, waisi pustakon main nahin milti
 There we find an active, vigorous, dynamic form of literature
 raajnneetik kshetra main is yug main jin patrapatrikaon kii dhooma rahi ve hai - Most of them are weekly, but their contribution to the creation of public has been significant
 jahaan tak patr kala kaa sambandh he vahaan tak ham spasht rup se kah sakate hai ki tisare or chauthe yug ke patron main dharti or akaash kaa antar he
 Today, editing is really high quality art
 raajnneetik patrakarita ke kshetra main "aaj" or uske sampadak swargeey baburao vishnu paradkar kaa lagbhag vahi sthaan he jo saahitiyik patrakarita ke kshetra main acharya mahaviraprasad dvivedi ko praapt he
 The truth is that "aaj" has done the work of a great institution in the field of journalism and it has given a number of editors and journalists to Hindi
 aadhunik sahitya ke anek angon kii bhanti hindi patrakarita bhi nai koti kii he or usamen bhi mukhyat: hamaare madhyavitt varg kii saamaajik, saanskrithik, saahitiyik ou raajnneetik hulchalon kaa pratibimb bhasvar he
 In fact, the true history of the last 200 years can only be compiled from our letter sheets
 banglaa ke "kaler katha" granth main patron ke avataranon ke aadhaar par bengal ke unnisvin shatabdi ke madhyavittiya jivan ke akalan kaa praytn hua he
 Such an effort is also desirable in Hindi
