 Officials of the Catholic religion were alert from the very beginning of the proper formulation of their religious beliefs and were able to protect them for centuries by explaining the propagators of misleading doctrines and excluding them from the religion as necessary

 For these reasons, historians have strongly condemned the Enquisition
 isaki sthapana san 1478 i
 main raja ke anurodh par is uddeshy se hui thi ki gupt musalamaanon tathaa yahudiyon kaa pataa lagaaya jaae
 The thing is that for some seven centuries, Muslim dominance over some regions of Spain and many Christians were predominantly Muslim
 duusari ore, raja ne spain ke yahudiyon ko yah aadesh diya ki isai bano athwa desh chhod do
 In this situation there was doubt about the new Christians of Spain whether they are Muslims or Jews inside

 'devi Chandraguptaam' is mentioned by ramchandra-gunachandra in 'natyadarpan', Bhoj in 'shringarprakash' and Abhinavagupta in 'natakashastra'
 yah naatak dhruvadevi or chandragupta dwitiya ke aitihaasik vrutt par aadhaarit he, kintu abhi iske kuch ansh hi praapt hue hai
 'raghavanand Natakam' may have been composed with the character of Rama, but it has also received one or two sprinkles
 ‘mudrarakshas’ kii rachana purvavarti sanskrit-natyaparampara se sarvatha bhinn rup main hui he
 By the way, Visakhadatta was well-known in Indian Natyashastra and for this reason he has had amazing success in maintaining the unity of 'work' in 'mudrarakshas', though this achievement may have been relevant given the prevalence of event-less
 kintu purvavarti lekhakon dwaara nirdhaarit pratimaanon kaa yathavat anukaran bhi unhen abhisht nahin tha
 That is why, through the shelter of sentimentality, imagination, etc
, the plot has a realistic portrayal of the success-failure in extra-life struggle
 unhone kathanak ko shuddh aitihaasik prishthbhumi pradaan kii he, svachhndatavaadi tatwon par unka bal nahin rahaa he
 The aristocratic approach is not only visible in story-combination and character-plotting, but also their conspicuous and powerful designation is the result of this trend
 is sandarbh main yah bhi ullekhneey he ki jis prakaar mallinath kii vyakhyaaon ke abhaav main kalidas ke krititv kaa anushilan apurna hoga, usee prakaar ‘mudrarakshas’ par dhundhiraj kii tikaa bhi prasiddh he
 The story of 'mudrarakshas' is famous
 is naatak ke namakaran kaa aadhaar yah ghatana he - apni mudra ko apane hi viruddh prayukt hote hue dekhakar rakshas kaa stabdh athwa vivash ho janaa
 In this, the story of Chanakya thwarting the political tricks of the demon after the ascension of Chandragupta is expressed in seven figures smoothly
 naatakkaar ne chanakya auki rakshas kii yojana-pratiyojnaon ko purna raajnneetik vaidagdhya ke saath upasthaapit kiya he
 He has given appropriate attention to the naturalness, curiosity and interestingness in organizing the play event
 tatkaaleen raajnneetigyon dwaara rajtantr ke sanchaalan ke liye kis prakaar ke upayon kaa aashray liya jaataa tha, iskaa naatak main rochak vivaran miltaa he
 The promptness of Chanakya's assistants to carry out the tasks assigned to them without worrying about interest or disinterest or free will is an excellent example of work related unity
 ghatnaon kii dharawahikta is naatak kaa prashansaneey gun he, kyonki shadyantr-pratishadyantron kii yojana main kahin bhi vyaghaat lakshith nahin hota
 Though its plot is complicated by Chanakya's description of devious tricks, the playwright has achieved amazing success in keeping it up-to-date
 isamen karyavasthaon, arth-prakrutiyon sandhiyon or vrittiyon kaa naatayashastravihit prayog hua he
 The play has been considered by the Indian masters to be five stages of story-development - beginning, effort, attainment, destiny, flourishing
 naatak kaa armbh ruchir or suniyojit hona chahie, kyonki naatak kii parvarti ghatnaon kii safalataa isi par nirbhar karti he
 In 'mudrarakshas', the story of the mentor giving Chanakya the monster's posture will come under 'prarabh'
 ‘praytn’ avasthaa ke antargat in ghatnaon kaa samavesh kiya ja saktaa he - chanakya dwaara rakshas or malyketu main vigrah karaane kii cheshtaa, shakatdas ko suuli dene kaa mithyaa aayojan, siddharthak dwaara rakshas kaa vishwaasapaatr banakar use dhokhaa dena aadi
 The playwright has described the rise of the demon by the events of Chandragupta and Chanakya's pseudo-opposition, the plan of invasion of Kusumpur by the demon, for the plan of 'attainment', but also the plans of diplomatist Chanakya
 chanakya dwaara rakshas or malyketu main vigrah kara dene or rakshas kii yojanaon ko vifal kar dene kii ghatnaayen ‘niyatapti’ ke antargat aati he
 The sixth-seventh numerals mention the acceptance of Chandragupta's amatya-post by him, presenting the background of the demon's self-surrender for the accomplishment of 'falagam'
 ukt avasthaaon kaa nirupan naatakaar ne jitani or swatchta se kiya he, vah prashansaneey he
 For the proper development of the plot, the Indian masters have also prescribed five semantics like functions - seed, point, flag, light, work
 inamen se 'pataakaa’ ke antargat mukhya praasangik katha ko prastut kiya jaataa he or ‘prakari’ se abhipraay gaun praasangik kathaon ke samavesh se he
 However, balanced development of relevant stories and official narrative is essential for the overall development of the plot
 ‘mudrarakshas’ main chanakya dwaara rakshas ko apane paksh main milaane kaa nishchay kathavstu kii ’beej’ he
 Whose expression is expressed in the statement of Chanakya in the first issue: "what does the killing of Nandas do until the demon is caught and what is Chandragupta getting from the kingdom? xxrep 4 
 It is not good for us to remain innocent in his capture
" 
 ’’ chanakya aadi kaa malyketu ke ashram main chale janaa bijnyas’ athwa beej kaa armbh he
 These events can be counted under 'bindu' - giving the demon pose to Chanakya by the master, writing letters to Shaktadas, and allowing Chanakya to make Chandandas a prisoner
 naatak kii fal-siddhi main siddharthak or bhagurayan dwaara kiye gaye prayant ‘pataakaa’ ke antargat ganya hai
 'prakari' has been organized at the end of the third and the fourth digits of the 'mudrarakshas' - the example of this reaching information in Chanakya and Chandragupta to false discord and demon
 rakshas dwaara chandragupta kaa mantritv sweekaar karke aatmasamarpan kar dena ‘kaary’ namni arth-prakruti haih avasthaaon ke antargat isi ko falaagam kii sangya di jaati he
 Bhartendu Harishchandra had also paid attention to the translation of Sanskrit-plays in addition to the original plays of 'satya Harishchandra', 'shri Chandravali', 'bharat Plight', 'niladevi' etc
 ‘mudrarakshas’ kaa anuwaad unhone 1878 i0 main kiya tha
 Prior to this, he was titled 'vidyasundar' of the Bengali version of the Sanskrit work 'chaurapanchashika', 'the hypocrisy of Prabodh Chandrodaya' of Krishna Mishra with the title 'hypocrisy' and 'karpoor-manjari' of Rajashekhar's Prakrit-work 'sattak' Had translated the title
 in anuwaadon main unhone bhavanuaad kii paddhit apanaai he, faltah inhen naatayaroopaantar kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 He has often presented the play's preface, Bharatavakya etc
 in original form
 isi prakaar shabdanuwaad kii pravriti kaa aashray na lekar charitra-vyanjana main paryaapt swatantra drushtikon rakhaa gaya he
 This is the reason that in Mudrarakshas, the basic thinking and language flow can often be targeted instead of the dryness of translation
 naatakagat kavyansh main yah pravriti or bhi spasht rup main lakshith hoti he

 These programs, examples of which include Lancelot Link in the 1970s, Secret Chimp, or The Chimp Channel in the 1990s, relied on the character of the apes to make their older, less comedic stories fun

 Another short story, "the Pope of the Chimps", written by present-day Robert Silverberg, shows signs of religiosity developing among a group of chimpanzees, which was largely surprising to those tracking his behavior
