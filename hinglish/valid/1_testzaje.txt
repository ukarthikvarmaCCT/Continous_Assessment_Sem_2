 Solid-level lasers where light is directed to the total internal reflection in an optical fiber are called fiber lasers
 Directing light allows cooling of long gain fields; Fibers have higher surface area to volume ratios that are effective in cooling effectively
 In addition, the fiber's undirected properties reduce thermal distortion of light
 Erbium and attribute ions are common active species in such lasers

 This is called photodarkening
 In bulk laser materials, freezing is not so effective and the effect of photodarkening is Is difficult to separate from thermal effects, but experiments in fiber shows that Fotodarkening may be linked to the long-lasting color center centers i photonic crystal lager naino sanrachanaon par aadhaarit lager hai jo madhyam main mili hote hai or optical kshetron kaa ghanatv sanrachana pratikriya ke liye aavashyak hota he i ye micrometer sies ke hote hai or photonic crystal ke band par inhen chalaaya ja saktaa he i Semiconductor lasers are also of solid degree but have a different method of laser operation

 The laser that produces a continuous beam or a series of low pulsations can be compared based on its average power
 The laser that produces a pulsation is called the high of each flutter
 Can be characterized on the basis of power
 The peak power of a pulsed laser is a series of magnitudes that exceed its average power
 Average output power b is always less than the power consumption

 Lasers commonly used by buffs belong to class iiia or iiib, although some have created their own separate class IV
 However, compared to other amateur logos, the number of laser buff logos is limited to its cost and potential hazards
 The reason is less
 Due to the cost of lasers, some enthusiasts are using inexpensive lasers such as diodes emitted from DVD burners

 Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin was one of the Russian-language poetical poets who is considered the best poet of Russian
 unhen aadhunik roosi kavita kaa sansthaapak bhi mana jaataa he
 We can understand Pushkin's short life span of 38 years by dividing it into 5 sections
 26 may 1799 ko unke janm se 1820 tak kaa samay balykaal or praarambhik sahitya rachana ko sametataa he
 The period from 1820 to 1824 is the exile period
 1824 se 1826 ke bich ve mikhayelovscoye main rahe
 He reached the peak of fame in 1826–1831, approaching the Tsar
 1831 se unki mrityu tak kaa kaal unke liye bada duhkhadaayi rahaa
 At the age of twelve, Pushkin was sent to study at Tsarskoyeselow's boarding school
 san 1817 main pushkin padhai puri kar saint petersburg aa gaye or videsh mantralay ke kaaryon ke atirikt unka sara samay kavita karne or mouj udaane main beetaa, isi dauraan sena ke noujvaan afasaron dwaara banaai gai saahitiyik sanstha greenlamp main bhi unhone janaa shuru kar diya tha, jahaan unki kavita kaa swaagat hua
 Using the freedom to express his views in a free environment, Pushkin wrote poems like Odd to Liberty, Chadayev and in the country
 dakshin main yekaterinoslav, kakeshas or kreemia kii apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone khub padhaa or khub likhaa, isi bich ve biimaar bhi pade or general rayevski ke parivaar ke saath kakeshas or kreemia gaye
 This journey became memorable in Pushkin's life
 kakeshas kii khubasurat vaadiyon main ve romantic kavi byran kii kavita se parichit hue
 In 1823, he was sent to Odessa
 oddesa main jin do striyon se unki najdikiyaan raheen unamem ek thi ek sarb vyapaaree kii italian patni emilia rigenich or duusari thi praant ke governor general kii patni countes vorontsov
 These two women made a deep impression in Pushkin's life
 pushkin ne bhi donon se samaan bhav se prem kiya or apni kavitaayen bhi unhen samarpit kin
 But on the other hand, the increased proximity to the Countess was not in his interest
 unhen apni maan kii jaagir mikhayelovscoye main nirvasit kar diya gaya
 In the two years that Pushkin spent in this remote northern corner of Russia, he was mostly alone
 par yahi samay tha jab unhone yevgeni anegin or boris godunov jaisi vikhyath rachanaayen puri kin tathaa anek sundar kavitaayen likhin
 Finally, in 1826, at the age of 27, Pushkin was recalled from exile by Tsar Nicholas to St
 Petersburg
 mulaakaat ke dauraan jaar ne pushkin se us kathith shadyantr kii babat poocha bhi jisaki badaulat unhen nirvaasan bhogana padaa tha
 He remained suspicious in the eyes of power and his creations had to fall prey to the censors, but Pushkin's love for freedom always persisted
 san 1828 main masco main ek nrity ke dauraan pushkin kii bhent nathalya goncharova se hui
 In the spring of 1829 he proposed marriage to Natalya
 anek baadhaon ke baavjood san 1831 main pushkin kaa vivaah nathalya ke saath ho gaya
 Pushkin's married life was not happy
 isaki jhalak unke likhe patron main milti he, pushkin kaa takaraav nathalya goncharova ke ek diwane francisi da'antes se hua jo jaar nicholas kaa darbari tha
 It is said that d'antes had fallen in love with Natalya
 da'antes ne nathalya kii bahan catherine se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 He and Natalya then met in hiding, and the conditions worsened
 yah pushkin ko sahan nahin hui or vah da'antes ko dwandv yuddh kaa nimantran de baitha
 In a duel war on 27 January 1837, Pushkin was badly wounded by d'antes' bullets and died two days later on 29 January 1837 at the age of 38
 pushkin kii achaanak hui maut se sansani fail gai
 a crowd of around fifty thousand people, including students, workers and intellectuals, had gathered in St
 Petersburg to pay tribute to the poet, leaving the so-called nobles of erstwhile Russian society
 keval 37 saal jikar pushkin ne sansar main apana aisa sthaan bana liya jise unhone apane shabdon main kuch is tarah vyakt kiya he: i have installed apana alokik smarak Can't ignore him jansamanya kii koi bhi raah

 vah haklaate hue bhaashan de rahaa he, is bhaashan ko sun hajaaron darshak pareshaan ho rahe hai
 The Prince undergoes a variety of treatments, but they all fail, in the end he is emboldened
 tabhi vah landan main ek australian bhashaa chikitsak lyonal log ke sampark main aata he

 vah berty ko hemelet ke "tu bi, ore note tu bi" swabhaashan ko padhne ke liye taiyaar kar letaa he, jabaki headphone par mozerat ke da marij of phigaaro ko sunata he
 Logue records the sentences read by Bertie on a gramophone record, telling Bertie that he is stunned during the entire reading, Bertie is shocked to hear

 As the treatment progressed, both of them became friends, also loyal to each other

 During a party at Balmoral Castle, Bertie states that Edward cannot marry a divorced woman while on the throne, Albert accuses his brother of medieval-style talking to him to remove him from the throne
 The sarcasm dictates that he pay attention to his language
 berty in aaropon ko sun kar chup rah jaataa he or edward use bachapan kii tarah "bi-bi berty" kahkar chidhaata he
 In the next season, Prince is not able to forget the incident

 When the war with Germany is declared in September 1939, George VI calls Logue to Buckingham Pelléas to prepare his radio address for the country
 jab raja or log peles main se hokar chote studio main jate hai, winston churchill king ko bataata he ki vah bhi kabhi haklaata tha, lekin kisi tarah se vah thik ho gaya

 Historian Andrew Roberts said that the severity of the king's stuttering is exaggerated, with characters from Edward VIII, Wellis Simpson and George v being more hostile to reality, to increase the dramatic effect
 christopher hichens or ijak chotinner ne padatyag ke sankat main winston churchill kii bhoomika ke film ke chithran ko chunauti di
 It is a known fact that Churchill encouraged Edward VIII to show opposition to his resignation, while he is portrayed in the film as a supporter of Prince Albert and not against his resignation

 Commenting on the final scene of the film, as King Buckingham stands in the Balconies of Pelléas, giving a speech on the declaration of war on 3 September 1939, Andrew Roberts writes, "the scene is absurd from a historical point of view - Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill was not present and there was no crowd outside the Buckingham Palace to cheer

 According to Islam, Hazrat Muhammad used to call Kalonji every medicine except death

 maine poocha ki ‘sam’ kya he? unhone kaha ki sam kaa matlab maut he
 " ورد حديث في صحيح البخاري عن عائشة - رضي الله عنها - أنها قالت: قال رسول الله -صلى الله عليه وسلم: " إن هذه الحبة السوداء شفاء من كل داء إلا السام، قلت: وما السام؟ قال الموت Kalounji is also included in the list of medicines of tib-i-nabvi or medicines of Prophet Muhammad

 wiliam shakespeare – 23 april 1616) angreji ke kavi, kaavyatmakataa ke vidwaan naatakkaar tathaa abhinayta the
 His plays have been translated into almost all major languages
 shakespeare main atyant ucch koti kii sarjanaatmak pratibha thi or saath hi unhen kala ke niyamon kaa sahaj gyaan bhi tha
 As if he had got a boon from nature, so everything he touched became gold
 unki rachanaayen na keval angrej jati ke liye gaurav kii vastu hai varan vishwavanmay kii bhi amar vibhuti hai
 Shakespeare's imagination was as severe as his life experience
 at: jahaan ek ore unke naatakon tathaa unki kavitaaon se anand kii uplabdhi hoti he vahiin duusari ore unki rachanaaon se hamako gambhir jeevandarshan bhi praapt hota he
 Poets are rarely found in Shakespeare's equivalent in the history of world literature
 wiliam shakespeare, jon shakespeare tathaa meri arden ke jyeshtha putr evam teesri santan the
 He was born in Stratford on Avon
 balykaal main unki shiksha sthaneey free grammer skool main hui
 Due to the increasing economic difficulties of his father, he had to leave school and engage in small business
 jeevika ke liye unhone landan jane kaa nishchay kiya
 There was another reason for this determination
 kadachit charl kot ke jameendaar sar tamas lusi ke udyaan se hiran kii chori kii ore kanoonee kaarywahi ke bhay se unhen apana janmasthan chhodana padaa
 He was married to Ann Hathaway in 1582
 san 1585 ke lagbhag shakespeare landan aae
 He initially worked on a small job in a theater, but a few days later he became a member of Lord Chamberlain's company and took part in acting in London's premier theaters

 In 1597, he gradually renovated and expanded
 isi bhawan main san 1610 ke baad ve apana adhikadhik samay vyateet karne lage or vahiin san 1616 main unka dehanth hua
 There is considerable disagreement as to the date of the works of Shakespeare
 san 1930 main prasiddh vidvan sar i
ke
 chambers ne tithikram kii jo talika prastut kii vah aaj praaia: sarvamaanya he
 Nevertheless, the discovery of previous years has led to some new assumptions regarding dates
 in nai khojon ke aadhaar par mike manve mahoday ne ek naveen talika taiyaar kii he jo sar i
ke
 chambers kii suchi se kuch bhinn he
 Shakespeare's prolific talent continued to develop over the course of nearly 20 years of literary life
 saamaanya rup se is vikascram main chaar vibhinn avasthaaen dikhaai detii he
 The initial phase ended in 1595
 is kaal kii praaia: sabhi rachanaayen prayogtmak he
 Shakespeare had not yet been able to determine his path, and was therefore progressively implementing his various compositions, in the prolific style of the ancient comical plays, 'the Comedy of Errors' and 'the Taming of the Sou'
 Created taduparant 'loves lebers lost' main inhone lily ke darbari sukhaant naatakon kii paripati apanaai
 It has an atmosphere of court which is full of interesting dialogue of clever characters
 'di tu jentilmen ov verona' main green ke svachhndathawadi sukhaant naatakon kaa anukaran kiya gaya he
 Sad dramas are also imitative
 'richard tritiy' main maalon kaa tathaa 'titus andranicus' main kid kaa anukaran kiya gaya he kintu 'romeo and juliet' main moulikta kaa ansh apekshaakrit adhik he
 Both the famous poems written in the same period 'the Rape of Lucreis' and 'venus and Adonis' have the imprint of the erstwhile Italian lovemaking
 vikascram kii duusari avasthaa san 1600 main samaapt hui
 In this, Shakespeare presented many mature works to the world
 ab unhone apana maarg nirdhaarit tathaa aatmavishvaas arjeet kar liya tha
 'A Mid Summer Nights Dream' and 'the Merchant on Venice' are interesting and popular melodramas but even more important are Shakepeare's quintessential pleasures such as Much Ado About Nothing, 'as You Like It' and 'twelve Night'
 Written in time
 in naatakon main kavi kii kalpana tathaa uske man ke ahlad kaa uttam prakaashan hua he
 The best historical plays were also written at this time
 marlo se prabhavit 'richard dwitiya' usee shrenee kii purvavarti kriti 'richard tritiy' se rachanavinyas main kahin adhik safal he
 Both the parts of 'henry IV' and 'henry V' which are well known historical dramas, are compositions of this period
 shakespeare ke praaia: sabhi sonet jo apni utkrisht abhivyakti ke liye anupam hai, san 1595 ore 1607 ke bich likhe gaye
 The third stage, which ended in about 1607, holds special significance in Shakespeare's life
 in varshon main paariwarik vipatti evam swasthya kii kharabi ke kaaran kavi kaa man avasann tha
 Hence, most of the compositions of these days are sad
 vishwaprasiddh du:khant naatak hamelet, othelo, king lier or makebeth evam roman du:khant naatak julius sijar, 'antony and cleopatra' evam 'coriolenus' isi kalavadhi main likhe gaye or abhinit hue
 'trivialus and Cressida', 'all's well that ends well' and 'major for Major' have a mixed expression of happiness and grief, even then only the tragic part is predominant
 vikaas kii antim avasthaa main shakespeare ne pericules, sinvilin, 'di winters tail', 'di tempast' prabhruti naatakon kaa sarjan kiya, jo sukhaant hone par bhi du:khad sambhaavnaaon se bhare hai evam ek sandhya vaataavaran kii sristi karte hai
 These joyous sorrow plays are termed as romance or Shakespeare's last plays
 shakespeare ke sukhaant naatakon kii apni nijee visheshtaayen hai
 Although Platus is followed in 'the Comedy of Errors', other pleasant dramas are completely different from the ancient classical plays
 inkaa uddeshy prahasan dwaara kurupataaon kaa mitaanaa tathaa trutiyon kaa sudhaar karnaa nahin varan rochak katha or charitrachitran dwaara logon kaa manoranjan karnaa he
 The theme of almost all such plays is such intense feeling of love that spontaneously arises in the minds of young men and women
 premi janon ke maarg main pehle to baadhaayen utpann hoti hai kintu naatak ke ant tak kathinaaiyaan vinasht ho jaati hai or unka parinaam sampann hota he
 In these compositions, there is a poetic and imaginative expression of life and the whole atmosphere is full of joy
 shakespeare kaa parichay katipay ucchwargeey pariwaron se ho gaya tha or unamem jis prakaar kaa jivan unhone dekha usee kaa prakaashan in naatakon main kiya he
 The grief plays highlight the serious problems of human life
 in naatakon ke abhijaat kulotpann nayak kuch samay tak safalataa or unnati ke maarg par agrasar hone ke uparaant yatnaa or vinaash ke shikaar banate hai
 Shakespeare's opinion on the subject of what causes his grief and death is clearly expressed
 nayak kaa durbhaagya anshat: pratikul niyati evam paristhitiyon se udbhoot he, kintu isse kahin bada kaaran uski charitrik durbalata main miltaa he
 In ancient Greek tragedies, the protagonist was only decimated by faulty judgment or flawed attitudes, but, perhaps influenced by Christianity and moralism, Shakespeare placed the principal responsibility for the hero's downfall on his character in his plays
 hamelet, athelo, lier or makebeth - in sabhi ke swabhaav athwa charitra main aisi kami milti he jo unke ksht evam mrityu kaa kaaran banati he
 In these sad plays, dual duality is reflected, internal duality and multi-duality
 aantarik dwandv nayak ke man main, uske vichaaron or bhaawanaaon main utpann hota he or apni tivrata ke kaaran na keval nirnay kathin bana detaa he apitu kuch samay ke liye nayak kaa asul vichlit bhi kar detaa he
 This type of internal duality has led to the emergence of psychological subtlety and interestingness in plays
 bahya dwandv bahari shaktiyon kii spardhaa or unke sangharsh se utpann hota he, jaise do virdohi raajnneetik dalon athwa senaaon kaa parsparik virodh
 In Shakespeare's major grief plays, the atmosphere of bloodshed and horrific scenes has created a very terror environment
 isi bhanti hatya or pratishodh sambandhi drishyon ke samavesh se bhi avsaad kaa put gaharaa ho gaya he
 Shakespeare took all these features and instruments from certain old plays and playwrights such as Seneca, Kid, Marlow, and used them in his plays, keeping in mind the occasional public interest
 du:khant naatakon kii jin visheshtaon kaa ullekh hamane yahan kiya he ve na keval hamelet, athelo, king lier, or makebeth main milti hai varan romeo and juliet tathaa england or rome ke itihaas par aadhrut du:khant naatakon main bhi aanshik rup main vidyaman hai
 Many of the historical plays that Shakespeare composed are Roman historians
 in roman naatakon ke lekhan main shakespeare ne itihaas ke tathyon ko thodaa bahut badal diya he or katipay sthalon par aisa prathit hone lagata he ki jivan kaa jo chitra upasthit kiya gaya he vah pracheen rome kaa nahin apitu alizveth kaaleen england kaa he
 Despite this, these plays have always been popular, especially Julius Caesar and Antoine & Cleopatra
 antony aid cleopatra kavitvapurn anshon sa bharaa padaa he tathaa cleopatra kii charitrakalpana atyant prabhavotpadak he
 The events of Greek history are represented in the Times of Athens and Perikiles
 angreji itihaas par aadhaarit naatakon main kuch to aise hai jo keval aanshik rup main shakespeare dwaara likhe gaye hai kintu henry chaturth ke donon bhaag or henry pancham purna roopen shakespeare dwaara pranit hai
 The poet has achieved great success in these three plays
 inamen shaury or sammanbhaavna kaa atyant aakarshak pratipaadan hua he or phalstaff kaa charitra atyant rochak evam spruhaniya hai
 Marlow has been successfully imitated in Richard III and Richard II
 shakespeare ke purv ke adhikansh angreji aitihaasik naatakon main tathyon or ghatnaon kaa nirjeev chithran rahata tha tathaa kori itivrittatmakataa ke kaaran ve neeras hote the
 Shakespeare has made these types of plays come alive by making them miraculous
 antim naatakon main shakespeare kaa paripakv jeevandarshan miltaa he
 Mahakavi had different experiences in his life, which is reflected in his creations
 pranay vishyak sukhaant naatakon main kalpanavilas he or kavi kaa man aishwarya or yauvan kii vilasita main rama he
 Grief plays express such sad experiences that make life toxic
 shakespeare ke krititv kii parinti aise naatakon kii rachana main hui jinamein unki samyak buddhi kaa pratifalan hua he
 The poet now sees with his prudent view that both happiness and sorrow remain embedded in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: donon hi kshanik hai
 Happiness comes after grief in life, so equality in thought and behavior is desirable
 in antim naatakon se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki hinsa or pratishodh kii apeksha dayaa or kshamaa adhik shlaghneey hai
 These plays have special significance due to their serious moral message
 shakespeare ke naatak svachhndathawadi hai tathaa pracheen unani or latin naatakon kii parampara se pruthak hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to find classical features of object in them
 keval apane antim naatak 'di tempast' main unhone teenon anvitiyon kaa nirvaah kiya he
 In almost all other plays, only the implementation has been taken care of, in terms of time and place, they are absolutely essays
 kathavstu main sadaiv paryaapt vistaar miltaa he or saamanyat: usamen kai kathaayen antarnihit rahati hai
 For example, we can take a Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Merchant on Venice, As You Like It or King Lear
 in sabhi main anek kathaon ke mishran dwaara vastunirmaan sampann hua he
 But this does not mean that the design of Shakespeare's plays is flawed
 ant:kathaon kaa natyavastu main sundar, kalapurna reeti se gunfan kiya gaya he tathaa sampurna kathanak se sankalit ekta kaa abhas miltaa he
 In spite of the lack of inventions in the classical sense, emotional and imaginative integration has taken place in these romantic plays
 patrakalpana main shakespeare ko or bhi adhik safalataa mili he
 In his plays he has created many fascinating characters who come before us in their lively form
 samay ke saath charitranirupan kii prakriya adhikadhik sookshm evam kalatmak hoti gai
 For example, we can take Rosalin, Porcia, Viartrus, Rosalind, Vayala Prabhriti Pragalbha, women included in the Sukhanta plays, who constantly introduce their sharp intellect and speech
 duusari koti kii ve naariyaan hai jinke anupam saundarya or sankatpurna anubhavon ke kaaran man main karunaa kaa udrek hota he
 The major among such females are Juliet, Ophilia, Desdimona, Cardilia, Imogen etc
 du:khant naatakon main charitrachitran kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 For example, we can take Hamlet
 naatak kii samast ghatnaayen nayak ke charitra par kendrit hai or usee ke vyaktitv ke prabhaav se katha kaa vikaas hota he
 Partially the same is true for other sad plays
 pracheen unani naatakon main anek smaraneey paatr milte hai kintu naitik or manovaigyanik upkarnon ke sahare ankit kiye hue shakespeare ke pramukh paatr kahin adhik rochak evam aakarshak hai
 The characterization of grief plays has become even more miraculous with the use of internal duality

 In primary stage, expression was more important and ideas were less important
 kintu is madhyamik kaal main vichaaron, bhaavon tathaa abhivyakti ke sadhano kaa samyak samanvay hua he
 This balanced system focused on Shakespeare's ideas and moral paradigms in the last years and ignored stylistic miracles

 Shakespeare wrote his plays primarily for theater, although we also enjoy reading from him because of his poetic qualities

 inke atirikt shakespeare kii vistrut kavitaayen hai, jinamein 'vinas and adonis', 'di rape aav lukris' tathaa sanets kaa ullekh aavashyak he

 'vinas and adonis' main ek pracheen premakatha ko atyant kaavyatmak reeti se varnit kiya gaya he
 'the Rape of Lucreus' tells the story of the misfortune and death of a supremely beautiful Roman woman
 sanets main kuch aise hai jo kavi ke ek mitra se sambandh rakhte hai jisane vivaah na karne kaa nishchay kar liya tha
