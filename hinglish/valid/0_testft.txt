 a Chaitya is a Buddhist or Jain temple which contains a stupa
 bhartiya vaastukala se sambandhit aadhunik granthon main, shabd chaityagrih un puja yaa prarthana sthalon ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he jahaan ek stupa upasthit hota he
 The architecture of Chaitya and the Roman design concept with pillars and arches show similarities
 chaityas, sanskrit 'chita' se vyutpann 
 This word is basically related to things related to Chita or Chita
 chita sthal par yaa mrit vyakti kii paavan raakh ke upar smriti-bhavannirmaan athwa vriksharopan kii pracheen parampara kaa ullekh brahman, buddha or jain saahitiyon main hua hai
 In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavadgita, the term is used for the sacred altar, devasthan, prasad, religious tree, etc
 - Devasthaneshu Chaityeshu Naganamalayeshu Ch, Prasadgopur Sabhachayatideva Grihadishu, Kanchichithayatasarjushta:; Chaityaupankita Bhumaryasayeya Savanakara
 baudhon or jainon main bhikkhu yaa sanyasi ke samadhisthal par paavan smriti-bhawan-nirmaan kii parampara hi chal padi thi
 As a result, such incidents have been mentioned in their literature very often
 dhire-dhire is shabd kaa prayog stupa ke liye hone laga
 With the propagation and propagation of Buddhism, chaitya nirman entered other countries
 srilanka main iske liye 'dagaba' or tibeti main 'dungten' shabd shabd prachlit hue
 Later, the word Chaitya was also used for a holy place, temple, astipatra or sacred tree
 aadhunik puravid is shabd kaa prayog saamanyatya buddha yaa jain mandir ke liye karte hai yadhyapi buddha vaastu main ek vishisht style main nirmit us bhawan ko chaityaprasaad kaha jaataa he jisamen upasna ke liye stupa pratishthapit kiye jate the
 In this way, the same religious sentiment was at the core of the creation of the Chaityaprasadas
 fergusan kaa mat he ki bhaja, nasik, ellora, karle aadi sthanon ke buddha chaityaprasaad girjagharon ke kaaphi nikat hai
 Their composition, altar or sanctum sanctorum, pavilion, etc
 have a lot of similarity, although the construction of chaityas started long before the churches
 garbhagrih, mandap or pradakshinpath kii rachanastyli tathaa chaityaprasaad or hindu mandiron main bhi vishesh samanta pai jaati he
 The stupa set up in the semicircular part of the Chaityaprasad was the center of worship
 stupa ke parshv se pradakshinpath jaataa tha jo usase stambhon dwaara pruthak kar diya jaataa tha
 The base of the palace was circular
 apane praarambhik rup main chaityaprasaad kashthanirmit hote the jinka ullekh ramayana tathaa buddha or jain saahitiyon main saamaan rup se hua he
 In due course, inspired by the spirit of making them permanent, the creators started the whole imagination of Chaityaprasad in solid rocks
 a new world of art began to be carved into them by cutting the rocks of the standing mountains
 unke bheetar bade bade mandap, stambh, stupa, banaae jane lage
 In the articles these have been called Selghar, Chettiar, Selmundap etc
 yadhyapi prarambh main is disha main kashthanirmit chaityagrih kaa andhanukaran kiya gaya or lakdi ke aadhaaron or jodon ko bhi anaavashyak dhang se pattharon main bhi utkeern kiya gaya, jaisaa ki bhaja, konda tathaa karle ke bhavy chaityaprasaadon se spasht hai, kintu baad main us anaavashyak rachanavidhan kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 There are about 900 such Chaitya caves in the area of two hundred miles of Nashik near Bombay, Western India, which were built during the period of BC
 Between the second century and the seventh century

 Saturn becomes the object of witchcraft, when Saturn gives its momentum in the first house, the first house is the only one, when the darkness starts hiding, the light is recognized and when the position is hidden then the shadow of Saturn Only darkness can be considered
 andhere ke kai rup hote hai, ek andheraa vah hota he jiske kaaran kuch bhi dikhaai nahi detaa he, yah ankhon kaa andheraa mana jaataa he, ek andheraa samajhane kaa bhi hota he, saamne kuch hota he, or samajha kuch jaataa he, ek andheraa buraaiyon kaa hota he, vyakti yaa jeev kii sabhi achchhaaiyaan buraaiyon ke andar chupane kaa kaaran bhi shani kaa diya gaya andheraa hi mana jaataa he, naam kaa andheraa bhe hota he, kisi ko pataa hi nahi hota he, ki koun he or kahaan se aayaa he, koun maan he or koun baap he, aadi ke dwaara kisi bhi rup me chhupav bhi shani ke kaaran hi mana jaataa he, vyakti chaalaaki kaa putala ban jaataa he pratham bhav ke shani ke dwaara
shani apane sthaan se pratham bhav ke andar sthiti rakh kar tisare bhav ko dekhtaa he, teesraa bhav apane se chote bhai bahino kaa bhi hota he, apni andaruni takat kaa bhi hota he, parakram kaa bhi hota he, jo kuch bhi ham dusron se kehete he, kisi bhi saadhan se, kisi bhi tarah se shani ke kaaran apni baat ko sampreshit karne me kathinaayee aati he, jo kaha jaataa he vah saamne vaale ko yaa to samaj me nahi aata he, or aata bhi he to ek bhayanak andheraa hone ke kaaran vah kahi gayi baat ko na samajhane ke kaaran kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, parinaam ke andar fal bhi jo chaiye vah nahi miltaa he, aksar dekha jaataa he ki jiske pratham bhav me shani hota he, uskaa jivan saathi jor jor se bolnaa chaalu kar detaa he, uskaa kaaran uske dwaara jor jor se bolne kii aadat nahi, pratham bhav kaa shani sunne ke andar kami kar detaa he, or saamne vaale ko jor se bolne par hi yaa to sunaayi detaa he, yaa vah kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, isi liye jivan saathi ke saath kuch sunne or kuch samajhane ke kaaran maansik naa samajhi kaa parinaam sambandhon me kaduvaahat ghul jaati he, or sambandh tut jate hai
 From its first house, the tenth eye directly looks at the spirit of karma, this is also the spirit of karma
 jataka ko karm karne or karm ko samajhane me kaafii kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pasta he, jab kisi prakaar se karm ko nahi samajha jaataa he to jo bhi kiya jaataa he vah karm na hokar ek bhaar swaroop hi samajha jaataa he, yahi baat pita ke prati maan lee jaati he,pita ke prati shani apni sift ke anusaar andhera detaa he, or us andhere ke kaaran pita ne putr ke prati kya kiya he, samaj nahi hone ke kaaran pita putr main anban bhi bani rahati he,putr kaa lagan yaa pratham bhav kaa shani mata ke chauthe bhav me chalaa jaataa he, or mata ko jo kaam nahi karne chaiye ve usko karne passage hai, kathin or ek seemaa me rahakar mata ke dwaara kaam karne ke kaaran uskaa jivan ek ghere main bandhaa sa rah jaataa he, or vah apni shariri sift ko us prakaar se prayog nahi kar paati he jis prakaar se ek saadhaaran aadmi apni jindagi ko jeena chahta he
 The second house is the sense of material wealth, by physical wealth means, rupee, money, gold, silver, diamond, pearl, jewelry, etc
 When Shani Dev is in the second house, he also keeps his dark towards his family members, Only by getting family members to fight, quarrel etc
, they distance themselves from their own family, in the matter of money, it is not known how much came and how much was spent, how much did it come from, the second feeling is the sense of speaking, whatever It is talked about, He does not know what has been said, can also be abusive and cold talk also, cold talk means negative thing, be asked to do any thing, nor should it come out in the north
 Also, the fourth house is also related to the mother, house, and vehicle, the fourth house is also known for its pleasures, in the second Saturn, nothing is seen except the traveling work and sleeping in the house
 doosraa shani sidhe rup me aathven bhav ko dekhtaa he, aathva bhav shamshani takaton kii taraf rujhaan badhaa detaa he, vyakti bhoot,pret,jinn or pishachi shaktiyon ko apnaane main apana man laga detaa he, shamshani sadhana ke kaaran uskaa khan paan bhi shamshani ho jaataa he,sharaab,kebab or bhoot ke bhojan main uski ruchi batch jaati he
 Second Saturn also sees the eleventh house, the eleventh house darkens its faith towards immovable property, darkens the mind towards friends and elder brothers and sisters
 ve kuch karnaa chaahate hai lekin vyakti ke dimag main kuch or hi samaj me aata he
 The third sense is of might, of the courage and courage of the person, wherever the person lives, of his neighbors
 in sabake kaarnon ke andar tisare bhav se shani pancham bhav ko bhi dekhtaa he, jiname shiksha,santan or turat aane vaale dhano ko bhi janaa jaataa he, mitron kii sahabhaagita or bhabhi kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa bhav mana jaataa he, pita kii mrityu kaa or dada ke bade bhai kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa he
 Apart from this, the third Shani also hurts the ninth house, in which knowledge of religion, social behavior, old customs and family practice etc
 is also hurt
 makaan or aaraam karne vaale sthano ke prati yah shani apni andhere vaali niti ko pratipaadit karata he
 This Saturn tortures Nanihal family
 chauthe bhav kaa mukhya prabhaav vyakti ke liye kaafii ksht dene vaala hota he, mata, man, makaan, or pani vaale saadhan, tathaa sharir kaa pani is shani ke prabhaav se gandala jaataa he, aaajeevan kshtdhene vaala hone se puraano me is shani vaale vyakti kaa jivan nark may hi bataaya jaataa he
 If this Saturn is of Libra, Capricorn, Aquarius or Pisces, then there is some reduction in sufferings in its fruit
 is bhav me shani ke hone ke kaaran vyakti ko mantra vetta bana detaa he, vah kitne hi good mantron ke dwaara logo kaa bhala karne vaala to ban jaataa he, lekin apane liye jivan saathi ke prati,jaaydaad ke prati, or nagad dhan ke saath jamaa puunji ke liye dukh hi uthaaya karata he
 Due to the presence of Saturn in the child and being cold, there is a delay in the child, there is a lot of female child, due to the loss of life with a partner, he remains more indifferent to his life

 According to astrology, there are three kinds of beliefs of Saturn's Saadhesati, firstly, secondly by Chandra Lagan or Zodiac and third by Sun Lagna, in North India, the calculation of Saturn's half-sati by Chandra Lagana has been in practice since ancient times

 During Sadesati, Saturn takes account of the deeds done by the native in the same way as the owner asks for the account after some time after giving full responsibility to the servant of a house, and in the case of mistake or mistake Punishment is given to the servant, similarly Shani Dev also punishes every creature
 or yahi nahi jin logon ne achche karm kiye hote hai to unako sadheshaati puraskaar bhi pradaan karti he, jaise nagar yaa gram kaa yaa shahar kaa mukhiya bana diya janaa aadi
shani kii sadhesati ke aakhyaan anek logon ke praapt hote hai, jaise raja vikramaditya, raja nal, raja harishchandr, shani kii sadhesati sant mahatmaon ko bhi pratadit karti he, jo jog ke saath bhoga ko apnaane lagate hai
 Every person must have a Sadesati once in thirty years, if this half-and-half is in Sagittarius, Pisces, Capricorn, Aquarius, it is less painful, if it will be in the fourth, sixth, eighth, and twelfth house, So the person will be unhappy, and all the happiness will be physical, mental, and economic
 They should never forget the "sapphire" in these Sadesati, if done, there is a possibility of loss of profit
 koi nayaa kaam, nayaa udyog, bhul kar bhi sadhesati main nahi karnaa chaiye, kisi bhi kaam ko karne se pehle kisi jaankaar jyotishi se jaankaree avashya kar leni chaiye
yahaan tak ki vaahan ko bhi bhuulakar is samay main nahi khareednaa chaiye, anyathaa vah vaahan sukh kaa vaahan na hokar dukhon kaa vaahan ho jaayegaa
hamane apane pichley pachchis saal ke anubhav me dekha he ki sadhesati main kitne hi udyogpatiyon kaa bura haal ho gaya, or jo crorespati the, ve rodpati hokar ek gamche main ghoomane lage
is prakaar se yah bhi naubhav kiya ki shani jab bhi chaar, chha:, aath, baarah me vicharan karegaa, to uskaa mul dhan to nasht hoga hi, kitna hi jatan kyon na kiya jaye
or shani ke is samay kaa vichaar pehle se kar liya gaya he to dhan kii raksha ho jaati he
 If caution is not taken then only remorse remains

 At a meeting held at the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation Secretariat recently, discussions started to find the SAARC anthem in this poem

 Dadabhai Naoroji was a Parsi intellectual, educationist, cotton merchant and early political and social leader of British India
 unhen 'bharat kaa vayovruddh purush' kaha jaataa he
 From 1892 to 1895 he was a member of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom
 dadabhai nauroji ne bharat main vishvavidhyalayon kii sthapana ke purv ke dinon main elfinston institute main shiksha pai jahaan ke ye medhaavi chaatr the
 He started his life as a teacher in the same institution and later he became a professor of mathematics, which was the highest position in the educational institutions for Indians in those days
 saath main unhone samajasudhar kaaryon main agragami or kai dharmik tathaa sahitya sanghatanon ke, yatha "students litereri and sanitific socity ke, pratishthata ke rup main apana vishesh sthaan banaaya
 It had two branches, a Marathi Gyanprasarak troupe and a Gujarati Gyanprasarak troupe
 rahanumai sabhi kii bhi sthapana inhone kii thi
 He also edited and operated the major paper of social reformers of his time called "rasta Gafftar"
 parsiyon ke itihaas main apni daansheeltaa or prabuddhata ke liye prasiddh "kaimaas' bandhuon ne dadabhai ko apane vyapaar main bhagidaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Accordingly Dadabhai went to England to establish his office in London and Liverpool
 vidhyalay ke vaataavaran ko chhodkar ekaek vyapaaree dhan janaa ek prakaar kii avnati yaa apwatan samajha ja saktaa he, parantu dada bhai ne is avasar ko england main ucch shiksha ke liye janevaale vidhyaarthiyon kii bhalaai ke liye upyukt samajha
 At the same time, his second objective was to launch a movement for greater Indianisation of government administrative institutions
 jo vidhyaarthee un dinon unke sampark main aae or unase prabhavit hue unamem suprasiddh ferojshah mehta, mohandas karmchand gandhi or mohammad ali jina kaa naam ullekhneey he
 Apart from this, another objective of Dadabhai was also to make the British public aware of the grief of the oppressed Indians from British rule and draw attention to their responsibility to remove them
 un dinon bhartiya civil sevaaon main sammilit hone ke icchhuk abhyarthiyon ke liye sabase kathinaayee kii baat yah thi ki unhen pratikul paristhitiyon main british abhyarthiyon se spardhaa kerani padati thi
 To overcome this inconvenience, Dada Bhai's suggestion was to conduct a civil service examination in England and India simultaneously
 iske liye unhone 1893 tak andolan chalaaya jab ki unhone vahaan loksabhaa main us sadan ke ek sadsy kii haisiyat se adhik sangharsh kiya or sabha ne bharat tathaa england main ek saath pariksha chalaane kaa prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 Other than that in those days, even more serious was the terrible impoverishment of Indians
 haalaanki dadabhai hi pehle vyakti nahin the jinhone iske liye dukh kii abhivyakti kii ho kintu ve pehle vyakti avashya the jinhone uske unmoolan ke liye andolan chalaaya
 He proved with facts and figures that while the Indians were engrossed in poverty, India's administrative service was the most expensive in the world
 sarkari aankade un dinon nahin ke samaan the or jaankaree praapt karne ke liye koi gaiyr sarkari saadhan bhi nahin tha
 After the preliminary survey on the economic condition of Indians, it was concluded that the average annual income of a person in the country was twenty rupees in total
 inhen sab aankadon ke aadhaar par east india association ke saamne unhone "wants and meens aav india' naamak niabandh 27 july 1870 ko padhaa
 By the end of the 19th century, Dadabhai advocated not only before many committees and commissions, but also in front of the British Parliament, to remove the evils committed towards India and keep warning the higher officials equally that if India’s moral and material As the decadence continues, Indians will be forced to boycott not only British goods but also British rule, Ntu it had no effect
 ant main unhone bharatiyon kii raajnneetik daastaa or dayaneey sthiti kii ore vishwa lokmat kaa dhyaan aakrisht karne ke liye mahaan prayaas karne kaa nishchay kiya jiskaa parinaam hua unki vrihadaakaar pustak pavarty and anbritish rule in india
 It contained many articles, speeches, essays and correspondence with high officials and their testimonies given before committees and commissions and citations of important acts and declarations

 His goal or goal was the welfare and advancement of India, which was still on his mind while struggling for membership of Parliament
 ve baraabar naishanal congress ke liye prachaar karte rahe or bharat main apane mitron ko likhe vividh patron main parsiyon kii rashtriya sangram se dur rahane kii pravriti kii ninda karte rahe
 There was no week in which he did not have letters from India and clippings of leaflets in relation to Congress and his letters should not reach the Indian friends
 kisi ne kabhi yah apeksha nahin kii thi ki dadabhai house aav kamans main itani badi halchal paidaa kar denge kintu us sadan main unki gatividhi or sakriyata se aisa prathit hota tha maano ve vahaan kii karypranali aadi se bahut pehle se hi parichit rahe hon
 His speeches were heard with great respect and attention about India's poverty, currency and exchange, the consequences arising from the promotion of opium or alcohol consumption
 apane lambey jivan main dadabhai ne desh kii seva ke liye jo bahut se kaary kiye un sabakaa varnan karnaa sthanbhav ke kaaran yahan sambhav nahin he kintu swashaasan ke liye akhil bhartiya congress ke kalakatta adhiveshan main unke dwaara kii gai maang kii charchaa karnaa aavashyak he
 He gave Swarajya the main position in his speech
 apane bhaashan ke dauraan main unhone kaha, ham koi krupa kii yachana nahin kar rahe hai, hamen to keval nyaay chahie
 In the course of my efforts from the beginning, i have had so many failures that were enough to make a person not only disappointed but also rebellious, but i have not been disappointed and i believe that within a short period of time, when As long as i am alive, a constitution which fulfills the demand for good governance, full of goodwill, truth and honor, will be accepted for India
 unki yah aashaa us samay puri hui jab ve saarvajanik jivan se avkaash grahan kar chuke the
 Congress workers and their friends in the East and West were busy preparing proposals to materialize the constitutional reforms as per the hopes of the new generation of India
 parantu 20 agast 1917 kii ghoshnaa ke do maheene purv dadabhai kii mrityu ho chuki thi
 This declaration paved the way for greater Indian cooperation in administrative services and the development of responsible governance in India under the British Empire respectively

 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' of Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he

 The frontier Thai people of the west were first under the Samar Kingdom of Kambuj but in the mid-14th century they began to attack Kambuj and repeatedly won and looted Angkorthom
 tab laachaar hokar khmeron ko apni vah rajdhani chhod deni padi
 Then gradually the flood of bamboo forests completely alienated the city from the civilized world and its power merged into darkness
 nagar bhi adhiktar tuutakar khandhar ho gaya
 In the late 19th century, a French scientist revived the city and its ruins after a five-day boat trip

 All the Ramayana sculptures are inscribed on its walls
 is mandir ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki videshon main jaakar bhi pravasi kalakaaron ne bhartiya kala ko jivit rakhaa tha
 It is evident from this that the worship of Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh and other gods was prevalent in Angkorthom which was the capital of Kambuj country
 in mandiron ke nirmaan main jis kala kaa anukaran hua he vah bhartiya gupt kala se prabhavit jaan padati he

 Vibhuti Mishra pataa : hindi sahitya sammelan prayag, 12, sammelan maarg, elahabaad-3 In mathematics, the inverse function of a function is called the function that changes the change made by the original function to its original form
 kisi falan ƒ main x rakhane par parinaam y miltaa he to ƒ ke pratilom falan main y rakhane par parinaam x milegaa, arthath ƒ=y or g=x to falan ƒ tathaa g ek-duusare ke pratilom falan hai
 We can say the same way in other ways: g) = x
 yadi falan ƒ kaa pratilom nikaala ja saktaa he to ise pratilomaneey kehete hai
 In this case, the only inverse of ƒ is called ƒ − 1
 udhaaharan ke liye, mana ƒ ek aisa falan he jo celsius main taap ke maan ko fahrenheit main badal detaa he
 So the inverse function will be the one that converts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius
 arthath Because jo c ke prayek maan ke liye satya he
 Different methods have to be used to extract the inverse
 ƒ−1 nikaalane kaa ek tarika yah he ki yadi pratilom kaa astitv he to sameekaran ko hal karen or x kaa maan nikaalen- y = ƒ for example, to hamen y = 3 kii sahaayta se x kaa maan nikaalnaa hoga: Hence the inverse function ƒ − 1 can be given by the following formula- roza luiz makkoli parks africa-america naagarik adhikaar kaaryakrtta thim jinhone sanyukt rajya america kii congress ne "da first ladi of civil ritis" or "da madar of da freedom movement" naamon se pukaara

 On the succession of Bahadurshah i and Amjash, a battle called 'jaju' near Samugarh took place on June 18, 1708, in which Azam Shah and his two sons 'bidar Bakht' and 'walajah' were killed
 bahadurshah pratham ko apane chote bhai 'kambaksh' se bhi mogul singhaasana ke liye ladaai ladani padi

 bahadur shah pratham ne bundela sardaar 'chhatrasaal' se mail-milaap kar liya
 Chhatrasal remained a loyal feudal
 bahadur shah pratham ko 'shahe bekabar' kaha jaataa tha
 Like the Rajputs, Bahadur Shah I's policy towards the Marathas remained unstable
