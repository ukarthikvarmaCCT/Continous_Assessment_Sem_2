japani drushtikon, haalanki, sabase alag he, yahaan tak ki anokhaa 
 Cultural differences give rise to four types of problems in international trade negotiations, at the following levels: kram mahatvapurn he; suchi par neeche kii ore kii samasyaayein gambhir hai kyonki ve adhik sookshm he
 For example, two negotiators will immediately notice if one is speaking Japanese and the other is German
 The solution to this problem can be simplified by hiring a translator or speaking in a common third language, or it can be as difficult as learning a language
 samaadhaan ke baavjood, samasya spasht he
 Cultural variation is nonverbal behavior, on the other hand, it is almost always hidden in the pages of our awareness
 ham kah sakate hai, ki ek aamane-saamne kii samjhauta vaarta main pratibhaagi amaukhik rup se - or adhik sookshm tareeke se - kaaphi zyaada jaankaree lete or dete hai
 Some experts argue that this information is more important than oral information
 lagbhag yah sab sanket, hamaari chetana ke str se neeche chalaa jaataa he
 When the non-verbal signals of foreign partners are different, the negotiators are very close to misinterpreting it and in that case they are not even aware of the mistake
 For example, when a French client continues to cause disruption, Americans feel very uncomfortable without seeing why this is actually the case
 is tareeke main, parsparik takaraav, aksar vyapaarik sambandhon par asar daalata he, adrishy rah jaataa he or, falswaroop sudhara nahin ja paata
 mulyon or soch or nirnay lene kii prakriya main antar or bhi gahare chhipe hote hai or isliye inkaa nidaan karnaa kathin ho jaataa he jisaki vajah se inkaa sahi ilaaj nahin hota
 in matbhedon kii charchaa neeche kii gai he, jise bhashaa or amaukhik vyavhaar ke saath shuru kiya gaya he
 Translation problems are often important in international negotiations
 or, jab bhashaaen, bhashaayi taur par pruthak hoti hai, to adhik samasyaon kaa purvanumaan lag janaa chahie
 vishesh rup se vaishvik samjhauta vaarta chunauteepurn kaam ho sakati he
 The English language is often used, but on the table it can be spoken as a second language by most authorities
 vastav main, england, bharat or america ke deshi vaktaaon ko aksar ek duusare ko samajhane main pareshaani hoti he
 Accurate translation into international engagements is a goal that has almost never been achieved
 iske alaava, bhashaa kii bhinnataaon ko kabhi-kabhi rochak tareeke se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Many senior officials in foreign countries speak and understand a little English, but prefer to speak in their "strong" native language and use an interpreter
 is prakaar, hamane ek varisht roosi vaartakar ko roosi main sawaal poochhate dekha he
 The interpreter then translated the question to his American counterpart
 jab dubhashiya bol rahaa tha to america kaa dhyaan dubhashiye kii ore tha
 However, the direction of the Russian gaze was towards the American
 isliye, roosi, bade dhyaan se or bina koi dakhal die america ke chehre ke haav-bhav or amaukhik pratikriyaaon par gaur kar saktaa tha
 Additionally, when the American was speaking, senior Russians had twice the time to respond
 kyonki vah angrezi samaj rahaan tha, vah anuwaad prakriya ke dauraan apni pratikriya taiyaar kar saktaa tha
 What is the importance of this extra time to react in a strategic settlement negotiation? What are the benefits of being able to carefully observe the non-verbal reactions of your top level counterpart in a high-stakes trade negotiation? Simply put, bilingualism is not a common trait for Americans, and therefore high-skill competitors in language gain a natural advantage in international commerce
 iske atirikt, america prabandhakon se suni gai ek aam shikaayat, videshi graahakon or saajheedaaron dwaara apni deshi bhashaa main aapas main charchaa se sambandhit he
 Frankly, this is considered rude and often American negotiators are likely to see some ominous qualities in this foreign conversation - "they are planning or telling secrets
" " yah ek aksar kii jane vaali america galati he
 The general purpose of such mutual discussions is to improve the translation problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek korian duusare korian se jhuk kar puch saktaa he "usne kya kaha?" yaa, aapasi charchaa, videshi dal ke sadasyon ke bich ek asahmati se sambandhit ho sakati he
 Both situations should be viewed by Americans as a positive sign - that is, understanding the translation accurately, enhances the ability to participate, and often leads to internal disagreements
 par chunki zyaadaatar america keval ek hi bhashaa bolte hai, donon hi sthitiyon ke saraahaa nahin jayega
 vaise, duusare deshon ke logon ke liye yah salaah di jaati he ki ve apni pehali kuch aapasi charchaaon kii vishaywastu kaa ek laghu vivaran americanyon ko de den taaki kisi apriy dharna kaa vikaas na ho
 But, beyond translation and interpreters, there are some problems at the language level
 chhadam vaarta ke aankade jaankareepurn hote hai
 In the study, the oral behavior of interlocutors from 15 cultures was videotaped
 pradarsh 1 ke khand main sankhyaayein, bayanon ke pratishat ko darshaati hai jinhen prayek soochibaddh shrenee main vargeekrut kiya gaya
 That is, 7 percent of statements made by Japanese negotiators were classified as promises, 4 percent as threats, 7 percent as recommendations
 chhadam vaarta ke dauraan vaartakaron dwaara prayukt maukhik saudebaaji vyavhaar ascharyajanak rup se sabhi samskritiyon main samaan sabit hue
 sabhi 15 samskritiyon main samjhauta vaarta mukhya rup se soochna-sahyog ranneeti se nirmit thi - sawaal or swa-khulaase
 dhyaan den ki israeli, swa-khulaase ke kram main nune ant par hote hai
 Their 30 percent was the lowest among all 15 groups, implying that they were the most reluctant to give information
 kul milakar, haalanki, prayukt maukhik ranneetiyon kii paddati, vividh samskritiyon main ascharyajanak rup se samaan thi
 Go to Exhibit 1, Oral Talks Tactics in 15 Cultures: maanav vigyaani re el
 bardvicel ne pradarshit kiya ki samvaad main sandesh ke 35% se bhi kam ko bole gaye shabd dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he jabaki anya 65% ko amaukhik tareeke se sampreshit kiya jaataa he
 Albert Mehrabian, a UCLA psychologist, has also interpreted the meaning from which face-to-face interaction originated
 vah khabar dete hai: Of course, some people can heave with exact percentages, but our work also supports the notion that nonverbal behaviors are important - how things are said is often more important than what is said
 
 pradarsh 2, 15 video tepe samoohon ke kuch bhashaai pahaluon or amaukhik vyavhaar kaa vishleshan pradaan karata he, arthath, chizon ko kaise kaha jaataa he
 While these efforts only scratch the surface of this type of behavior analysis, they still provide clues to substantial cultural differences
 dhyaan den ki, ek baar phir japani, vyavhaar ke soochibaddh lagbhag har aayam par is kram ke ant par yaa uske nazadik hai
 In these 15 groups, their facial disguise and touch are minimal
 keval uttari chini logon ne shabd kaa aksar upyog kiya or japani kii apeksha keval roosiyon ne adhik khamosh avadhiyon kaa prayog kiya
 Go to Exhibit 2, Linguistic aspects of language and nonverbal behavior in 15 cultures: pradarsh 1 or 2 main aankadon kaa ek vyapak pareekshan ek adhik sarthak nishkarsh kaa khulaasa karata he: vaarta kii maukhik saamagree par vichaar karne kii tulana main bhashaa ke bhashaai pahaluon or amaukhik vyavhaaron kii tulana karne main samskritiyon main bhinnata adhik milti he
 For example, consider the huge difference between Japanese and Brazilians in Exhibit 2 compared to Exhibit 1
 video tepe kiye gaye 15 saanskrithik samoohon main se prayek ke vishisht pahaluon kaa atirikt vivaran aage he
 Certainly, statistically significant differences between individual cultures cannot be drawn without large samples
 However, it is worthwhile to briefly consider the cultural differences mentioned
 japan japani vaarta vyavhaar ke adhikansh vivaran ke anuroop, is vishleshan kaa parinaam yah darshata he ki sahabhaagita kii unki style sabase kam aakraamak he 
 dhamkee, aadesh or chetavaniyon ko, adhik sakaaratmak vaade, siforeeshon or patibaddhtaon ke paksh main hatotsahit kiya jaataa he
 a special indication of his polite style of communication is not his and the lack of use of you and facial expressions, as well as periods of silence
 korea vishleshan kaa shaayad ek adhik dilachasp pahalu he asian vaarta style kaa vaishamy
 gaiyr-asian, purvi deshon ke bare main aksar samanyikaran karte hai; nishkarshon se yah pradarshit hota he ki yah ek galati he
 Korean negotiators exercised significantly more impunity and order than Japanese
 korianyon ne japaniyon kii tulana main teen guna adhik nahin shabd kaa istemaal kiya or hastkshep kiya
 Also, there was no period of silence among Korean negotiators
 china 
 uttari china ke vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar, prashn poochne main sabase ullekhneey tha 
 beshak, chini vaartakaron dwaara die gaye bayanon ke 70 pratishat ko jaankaree vinimay ranneeti ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya
 Other aspects of his behavior were quite similar to those of the Japanese, especially not the use of the TUM and the silent period
 taiwan
 taiwan main udyog jagat ke logon kaa vyavhaar china or japan se kaaphi bhinn tha magar korea ke samaan tha
 The Chinese on Taiwan were extraordinary at face time - 20 or 30 minutes on average approx
 They asked fewer questions and provided more information than any other Asian group
 rus
 kisi bhi anya europea samooh se roosi style kaaphi alag thi or, vastav main, kai myanon main japani style ke kaaphi samaan thi
 They used no and Tum less and used the silence period more than any other group
 keval japani hi chehre kii bhav bhangimaaon ko kam dekhte hai or keval chini hi adhiktar prashn poochhate hai
 The behavior of Israeli Israeli interlocutors was specific in three respects
 jaisaa ki upar ullekh kiya gaya he, unhone nijee-khulaase ke sabase kam pratishat kaa upyog kiya, jaahir taur par apane card ko apekshaakrit pakade rakhaa
 vaikalpik rup se, vaadon or siforeeshon kaa sarvocch pratishat kaa istemaal kiya, manaane kii in ranneetiyon kaa asaamaanya rup se baari upyog kiya
 With 5 percent they were at the end of the percentage scale of authentic appeal where the competitors had the most reference to offer
 shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki israeli vaartakaron ne kisi bhi anya dal ke vaartakaron kii tulana main ek-duusare ko aksar baadhit kiya
 Indeed, it is only for this critical nonlinear behavior that he is presumably given the stereotype of "dhekelu" often used by Americans to describe Israeli partners in their settlement negotiations
 germany germanon ke vyavhaar ko chihnit karnaa mushkil he kyonki ve lagbhag sabhi kram main madhya main sthaan rakhte hai
 The Germans, however, were exceptional with a high percentage in terms of private-disclosure and a low percentage in questions
 united kingdom british vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar ullekhneey rup se sabhi maamalon main america ke logon ke samaan tha
 Most British negotiators have a strong sense of right and wrong in negotiating settlement
 protocol kaa bahut mahatv hota he
 Digga is perhaps a good metaphor for the Spanish approach to the Spain settlement negotiations, which appears in our figure
 jab aap madrid main ek phone kol karte hai, to aam taur par duusare chor se milane vaali pratikriya hola nahin hoti he, balki, diga hoti he
 It is therefore not surprising that Spanish used the highest percentage of orders and provided relatively less information than any other group, even in videotape talks
 In addition, they often created more obstacles than any other group and they used the word no and tum fairly
 frans 
 france ke vaartakaron kii style, sabhi samoohon main shaayad sabase aakraamak thi
 In particular, they used the highest percentage of threats and warnings
 anya samoohon kii tulana main unhone hastkshep, chehre par nigaah or nahin or tum kaa bhi aksar istemaal kiya or ek francisi vaartakar ne chhadam vaarta ke dauraan apane saathi ke haath ko bhi chuaa
 Brazil The people of the Brazilian industry were quite aggressive like the French and Spanish
 sabhi samoohon main unhone adeshon ke duusare sabase ucch pratishat kaa istemaal kiya
 On average, the Brazilian used the word 42 times, 90 times you, and touched each other's hands 5 times during the 30-minute settlement negotiations
 The eyes were also high on eyes
 mexico
 hamaari samjhauta vaarta main mexican vyavhaar kii paddati kshetreey yaa bhashaa-samooh ke samanyikaran ke khataron ke achche anusmarak rahe hai
 Both their verbal and non-verbal behavior differed significantly from their Latin America or continental cousins
 darasal, mexico ke log telephone kaa jawaab adhik dakshatapurna buno se dete hai 
 kai maamalon main, mexican vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar bahut kuch sanyukt rajya america ke samaan tha
 French-speaking Canadian French-speaking Canadians treated their continental brothers fairly
 france ke vaartakaron kii tarah, unhone ne bhi dhamkiyon or chetavaniyon ke ucch pratishat kaa upyog kiya or apekshaakrit adhik hastkshep or chakshu sampark kiya
 The aggressive style of such reconciliation does not match the peaceful style of other English speakers, including some Asian groups or English-speaking Canadians
 angreji bhashi canadow angrezi ko pratham bhashaa ke rup main bolne vaale canadaayiyon ne, sabhi 15 samoohon ke bich manaane kii aakraamak ranneeti ke sabase kam pratishat kaa upyog kiya 
 shaayad, jaisaa ki samvaad shodhakartaaon kaa suzav he, aise shailigat matbhed aatanrik-nrijaateey kalah kaa bijaropan karte hai, jaisaa ki kai varshon ke dauraan canada main dekha gaya
 In relation to international negotiations, English-speaking Canadians apparently exercised more and no more interventions than both the US and Japan, Canada's major trading partners
 sanyukt rajya america 
 german or british kii tarah, america bhi adhikansh kram main madhya main rahete hai
 They undermined each other less than others, but that was the only difference
 in tamaam samskritiyon main bhinnataayen kaaphi jatil hai or swayan is saamagree kaa prayog videshi samakakshon ke vyavhaar kii bhavishyavaanee ke liye nahin kiya janaa chahie
 iske bajaay, rudh praaroop ke purvakthith khataron ke sambandh main vishesh saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 yahaan yah mahatvapurn he ki is prakaar kii bhinnataaon ke bare main pataa hona chahie, taaki japani khamoshi, brazilian "nahin, nahin, nahin


," yaa francisi dhamkee ko galat na samajha jaae
 In addition to the 15 cultures discussed, below is an excerpt on the approach to settlement negotiations in the Mediterranean region
 "bumadhya samskruti puri tarah garmjoshi vaali he
 Warm greetings and social aspects
 There is a lot of use of currencies and gestures
 samjhauta vaarta ko kisi vishesh saudon main yaa samjhauta vaarta ke vishesh charnon main spasht vyakhya karnaa kathin he
 In some areas, the deal requires 'lubrication'
 vastav main, 'snehan' kaa yah sawaal bumadhya deshon kii kuch samskritiyon ke liye mahatvapurn he
 It is seen as a common practice and does not have the repulsive character of 'bribery'
 in samskritiyon main samjhauta vaarta karne ke drushtikon ke liye aise anushaasan kii zarurat hoti he jisaki ham charchaa kar rahe the; or tab bhi snehan kii jarurat ke prati jaagruk rahanaa chahie
 chunki koi bhi sammanjanak pashchimi company, rishwatakhori ke abhyaas se judana chaahegi, zarurat ek sthaneey agency ko praapt karne kii he or yah sunishchit karne kii he ki vah agency snehan ko sambhaal rahi he
 " chaar prabandhkeey mulyon ko - nishpakshta, pratispardhaa, samanta or samay kii pabandi, jise adhikansh americanyon dwaara majbootee se pakadaa jaataa he, vah antarrashtriya vyapaar vaartaon main aksar galatchhemiyon or buree bhaawanaaon ko janm detaa hua dikhataa he
 "americans make decisions based on hard points, cold ends and cold facts
 " "america bhai-bhatijawad nahin khelte hai
 "" Economics and performance have value, not people
 "" Trade is business
 " aise kathan nishpakshta ke mahatv ke america vichaaron ko acchhee tarah se pratibimbit karte hai
 The single most successful book on the subject of settlement negotiations, Getting to Yes, is highly recommended to both foreign and American readers
 videshi na sirf vaarta ke bare main seekhenge balki, shaayad adhik mahatvapurn rup se yah janenge ki america log vaarta ke bare main kya sochate hai
 The author is very firm on "separating the person from the problem" and states that, "each negotiator has two types of interests: in substance and in relationship"
 This advice is probably quite meaningful in the US or in Germany, but in most parts of the world such advice is nonsense
 duniya ke adhikansh sthanon main, vishesh rup se samooh-unmukhi, ucch sandarbh samskritiyon main, vyaktitv or padaarth alag mudde nahin hai or unhen alag kiya bhi nahin ja saktaa
 For example, consider how important nepotism is in Chinese or Hispanic cultures
 visheshgy bataate hai ki badhate "chini rashtramandal" main kaarobaar, kathor paariwarik niyantran kii seemaa or sambandhon se pare nahin badhate
" spain, mexico or philippines main bhi isi tarah se kaam hota he
 And, naturally, negotiators of such countries will not only take things personally but will also be personally affected by the results of the negotiations
 His experience at the negotiating table will also affect business relations, no matter how much meaning is involved
 chhadam vaarta ko prayogtmak arthshaastra ke ek prakaar ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he jahaan bhaag le rahe prayek saanskrithik samooh kaa mulya, lagbhag aarthik parinaamon main pratibimbit hota he
 This simple pseudo-action, used in this part of our work, represents the essence of commercial negotiation - it includes both, competitive and collaborative aspects
 prayek samskruti ke udyog jagat ke kam se kam 40 logon ne, vahi khariddaar-vikreta khel khelaa or teen utpaadon kii keemton par samjhauta vaarta kii
 antim samjhaute ke aadhaar par, "vaarta kii pai" ko, kharidaar or vikreta ke bich ise vibhajit kiye jane se pehle, sahyog ke madhyam se or bada kiya ja saktaa he 
 parinaamon ko pradarsh 3 main sankshepit kiya gaya he
 Go to Exhibit 3, Cultural differences in competition and equality in the negotiation results of 20 cultures: pai ko bada karne main japani champion the
 Among the 21 cultural groups involved, their combined gain in proxy talks was the highest
 Chinese and British businessmen in Hong Kong also acted cooperatively in our negotiation game
 check or german ne adhik pratispardhi rup main vyavhaar kiya
 American pie was more of an average size, but at least it was divided relatively evenly
 In contrast, Japanese merchants, particularly Japanese and South Korean, divided their pies in a bizarre manner, with buyers receiving a higher percentage of profits
 The result of these pseudo-trade negotiations is entirely consistent with other authors' comments and the adage that the buyer in Japan is the "kinger"
 khariddaaron kii ichchhaaon ko puraa sammaan dene ke japani abhyaas kii samaj americanyon main bahut thodi hi he
 Things don't work like this in America
 america vikreta, america kharidaaron ko ek baraabar ke rup main adhik vyavhaar karte hai or america samaaj ke samtawadi mulya is vyavhaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 The American emphasis on individualism and contestation, reflected in these findings, is highly consistent with Geert Hofstad's work, indicating that Americans on the individualist scale scored higher than all other cultural groups
 Furthermore, values of individualism / collectivism have been seen to have directly influenced the practices of negotiation in many other countries
 ant main, na keval japani kharidaar america kharidaaron se adhik parinaam praapt karte hai, balki america vikritaon ke saath tulana main, japani vikritaon ko vanijyik pai kaa bhi bada hissaa miltaa he
 Interestingly, when these results are shown, Americans still often prefer the role of American salespeople at executive seminars
 duusare shabdon main, bhale hi america vikreta, japani kii tulana main kam laabh kamaate hon, kai america prabandhak jahiraa taur par kam laabh pasand karte hai agar vah laabh, kisi sanyukt laabh ke samaan vibhaajan se upja ho
 "just make them wait
" Everyone else in the world knows that no other settlement negotiation strategy with the Americans is more useful, because no one values so much time, no one is so impatient when things slow down, and more often than not Americans stick their wrist Does not look at the clock
 Edward T
 Hall, in his seminal writings, has best described how different cultures have seen the passing of time and how these differences hurt Americans the most
 yahaan tak ki america bhi apane laabh ke liye, samay main herpher karne kii koshish karte hai
 As a case in point, Solar Turbine Incorporated once sold a $ 34 million industrial gas turbine and compressor for a Russian natural gas pipeline project
 donon pakshon main sahmati hui ki vaarta, kisi ek tatasth sthaan par yojit kii jaaegi, france ke dakshin main
 pichhali vaartaon main, rus kathor tha lekin uchit tha
 But in Nice, Russia was no good
 ve adhik kathor ho gaye the or vastav main, solar ke shaamil adhikariyon ke anusaar puri tarah se anuchit the
 The Americans spent a few hard days diagnosing the problem, but once done, an important call was made back to the San Diego headquarters
 roosi kyon itane ruukhe ho gaye the? ve nise main garm mausam kaa anand le rahe the or ek twarit saude ko antim rup dekar waapas masco jane ke icchhuk nahin the! california ko bulaanaa is samjhauta vaarta main mahatvapurn ghatana thi
 The people at Solar's headquarters in San Diego were so sophisticated that they allowed their interlocutors to take enough time
 From that moment onwards, the routine of negotiations became brief, including a 45-minute meeting in the morning, a golf course in the afternoon, a beach, or hotel, calling and paperwork
 ant main, chauthe saptaah ke dauraan, roosiyon ne riyaayaten dena shuru kiya or lambey samay kii baithkon kii maang kii
 kyon? ve bumadhya par chaar saptaah guzaarane ke baad, bina ek hastakshrit anubandh ke masco waapas nahin ja sakate the
 This strategic pressure of time gave Solar a wonderful contract
 jab samjhauta vaarta ke kisi jatil kaary kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, to adhikansh pashchimi log vishaal kaaryon ko chote kaaryon kii ek shrinkhalaa main vibhajit kar lete hai
 Issues such as prices, repayments, warranties and service contracts can be resolved one issue at a time, where the final agreement will be the sum of the sequence of smaller agreements
 In Asia, however, a different approach is adopted in which all issues are discussed together in no apparent order, and concessions are given on all issues at the end of the negotiations
 pashchimi anukramik drushtikon or purvi samgr drushtikon, acchhee tarah nahin mil pate
 Which means, that American managers often report major difficulties in measuring progress in negotiations, especially in Asian countries
 After all, in America, when half of the issues are settled, you are half sure
 lekin china, japan, yaa korea main kuch bhi sulajhaata nahin dikhataa he
 Then you will be surprised if you are done
 Often, Americans make unnecessary concessions just before the agreement is announced by the other party
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek america departmental store ke kaaryakari ne jo apni shrinkhalaa ke liye chah alag upabhokta utpaadon ko kharidne ke liye japan kii yatra kar rahaa tha, pachhtaawaa vyakt kiya ki pehle utpaada ke liye samjhauta vaarta main puraa ek saptaah lag gaya
 In the United States, such a purchase is finalized in one afternoon
 to, uski gananaa ke anusaar, use laga ki use apni kharid ko puraa karne main japan main chah saptaah lag jaayenge
 usne prakriya ko tej karne kii koshish main kharid keemton ko upar uthaane par vichaar kiya
 But before he was able to make such a concession, the Japanese soon agreed to five other products in just three days
 is vishesh prabandhak ne, apni khud kii sweekaarokti ke anusaar, japani saudebaajon ke saath apni pehali muthbhed main khud ko bhaagyashaalee mana
 Almost a major mistake of this American executive reflects something more than a difference in decision-making style
 americanyon ke liye, ek vyapaarik samjhauta vaarta, ek samasya-samaadhaan gatividhi he, donon dalon ke liye samaadhaan, sabase acha sauda he
 On the other hand, for a Japanese businessman, negotiating a trade agreement is the time to develop trade relations for the goal of a long-term mutual benefit
 aarthik mudde vaarta kaa sandarbh hai, saamagree nahin
 is prakaar, kisi ek mudde kaa samaadhaan, vastav main itnaa mahatvapurn nahin he
 Once a viable, harmonious business relationship is established, such details will be resolved automatically
 And, as in the case of the buyer of retail items above, once the relationship was established - first marked by agreement - other "details" were quickly resolved
 america saudebaajon ko asian samskritiyon main aam is tarah ke ek samgr drushtikon kaa purvanumaan hona chahie or jahiraa taur par avyavasthit kram main sabhi muddon par ek saath samjhauta vaarta karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 vaarta main pragati kaa maapan isse nahin karnaa chahie ki kitne muddon kaa samaadhaan hua he
 Rather, Americans should try to measure the quality of business relationships
 Important signs of progress can be: bhinn samskritiyon ke bich hone vaali vaartaon main sambhavit samasyaon par vichaar karne par, vishesh rup se jab aap sambandh-unmukhi samskruti ke prabandhakon ko, soochna-unmukhi prabandhakon se milaate hai, to aashcharya hota he ki koi bhi antarrashtriya vyapaar puraa ho jaataa he
 Clearly, the economic imperatives of global trade benefit from this despite potential losses
 lekin saanskrithik bhinnataaon kii saraahna karne se or bhi behatar antarrashtriya vanijyik lenden falit hota he - antarrashtriya vyapaarik vaartaon kaa lakshya sirf vyapaarik saude nahin balki rachanaatmak or atyadhik laabhadaayak vyavsaayik sambandh hai jo vaastavik lakshya hin
 Due to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation as parties is being widely adopted
 ek jatil samjhauta vaarta ko sulajhane main dal, prabhavi dhang se sahyog kar sakate hai
 More knowledge and information are scattered in a team than a single person
 lekhan, shravan or charchaa, vishisht bhoomikaayen hai jise dal ke sadasyon ko santusht karnaa chahie
 ek dal kaa kshamta aadhaar, galatiyon kii maatra ko kam kar detaa he or ek samjhauta vaarta main antarangta ko badhaata he

 Adam Smith was a Scottish politician, philosopher and political economist
 unhen arthshaastra kaa pitamah bhi kaha jaataa he
 Adam Smith's name comes first among the makers of modern economics
 His book 'the wealth of nations has greatly influenced the historians and economists of the eighteenth century
 From Karl Marx to David Ricardo, many famous economists, sociologists and politicians have taken inspiration from Adam Smith
 Among the economists of the twentieth century who drew inspiration from Adam Smith's ideas, the names of Marx, Engels, Malthus, Mill, Kens and Friedman are notable
 Adam Smith himself was influenced by scholars such as Aristotle, John Lock, Hobbs, Mendville, Francis Hutcheson, Hume etc
 Smith did notable work in the fields of economics, political philosophy and ethics
 But he got special recognition only in the field of economics
 Modern marketism can also be seen as a recognition of Adam Smith's ideas
 Adam Smith's date of birth is not sure
 Some scholars consider him to be born on 5 June 1723 and some on 16 June of the same year
 Whatever it was, he was born in Kirkaldi, a village in Scotland
 Adam's father was in charge of the customs department
 But he died almost six months before Smith's birth
 Adam was possibly the only child of his parents
 He was still only four years old that suffered trauma
 Adam was kidnapped by an organization of Gypsies
 At that time his uncle assisted his mother
 Adam was consequently secured
 After his father's death, Smith was sent by his mother to study at the University of Glasgow
 At that time, Smith was only fourteen years old
 Due to his sharp intellect, he completed school level with good marks, due to which he started getting scholarship
 Which opened the way to Oxford University for further studies
 There he gained knowledge of ancient European languages
 By that time, it had not been decided that the student of linguistics would not only earn a name in the field of economics, but would also make an epoch-making contribution to the field of global economy on the basis of its fundamental foundations
 Smith in 1738 eminent scholar - Passed the undergraduate examination in moral philosophy under the leadership of the philosopher Francis Hutchison
 He was deeply influenced by Francis' intelligence and considered him and his days spent teaching, unforgettable
 Being very talented, Smith's talent was started to be recognized from the college level itself
 Therefore, after completing his studies, when young Smith returned to his native city of Scotland, by the time he had given many important lectures, his fame began to spread
 While living there, he studied David Hume's famous work a Treatise of Human Nature in 1740, which impressed him immensely
 David Hume was one of his role models
 The two had a deep friendship
 Hume himself was highly impressed by Rousseau's talent
 An incident is mentioned behind the friendship of both
 According to which Hume once saw Rousseau's personal diary, he made serious comments about religion, society, politics, economics, etc
 After that incident, the two became close friends
 Hume was almost ten years older than Adam Smith
 In addition to David Hume, the names of John Smith, Hugh Blair, Lord Hallis, and Principal Robertson, among the prominent friends of Adam Smith, are notable
 He got the first offerings of his hard work and talent quickly
 In 1751, Smith got a job as a spokesperson for logic at the University of Glasgow
 The following year, he was made the head of the department of moral philosophy
 Smith's work of writing and teaching was going on continuously
 In 1759, he completed his book 'principle of moral sensations'
 This book became the subject of discussion with its publication
 In addition to his English, German and French versions started selling hands-on
 The book was about the relationships and moral behavior of the individual and society
 By that time, Smith's tendency was limited to political philosophy and ethics
 Gradually Smith began to get bored with the monotonous and monotonous environment of the universities
 He began to realize that what he wanted to do was not possible to do it in the college environment
 Meanwhile, his tendency towards economics was increased
 Especially during the teaching on political philosophy, economic aspects were also considered in the lecturers
 One of his students compiled his thoughts, Which were later edited by Edwin Cannon
 Only in those articles were the elements of 'wealth of Nations' safe
 After spending nearly twelve years in the field of teaching, Smith resigned from his college job and started teaching tuition to earn a living
 During this period he traveled to France and European countries and met contemporary scholars David Hume, Voltaire, Rousseau, Francis Quesne, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, etc
 Meanwhile, he also wrote many research essays, due to which his reputation increased
 He returned to Kirkaldi a few years later
 While living in his native village, Smith completed his most talked about book, The Wealth of Nations, a unique book on political science and economics
 With the publication of the book in 1776, Adam Smith began to be counted among the scholarly scholars of his time
 Philosophy has influence on this book
 Those who are not familiar with Smith's life, He would be even more surprised to know that Smith had written this book in connection with his teaching work as a professor of philosophy
 In those days, books of history and philosophy were taught more in universities, there was also a subject of theological studies
 The study of jurisprudence simply means a detailed study of the judicial system naturally
 Contemplation of Government and then Economy of Economy
 In this way it is clear that in his book 'wealth of Nations', Smith has given philosophical discussions of economic principles
 The novelty of the subject and the original style of presentation are the main features of the book
 He had a rich library, which contained hundreds of rare texts
 He liked to live in a quiet and secluded environment, where no one would interrupt his life
 Smith remained a bachelor for a lifetime
 Work should not be hurt by the absence of happiness and the presence of unrest in life, so he said that society should be formed on the basis of the usefulness of human beings, such as merchant groups are formed; Not on mutual attachment or any other emotional basis
 Adam Smith's fame in the field of economics is due to his well-known theory, 'leje Fair', which later became the promoter of liberal economic policies
 Leje Fair meant 'freedom to work', that is, minimal government intervention in the field of economic activities
 The correct information about the true origins of this slogan that propounds modern industrial capitalism and revolutionized the production system is not claimed
 But there is a popular story in this regard, according to which this quote was born in 1680, The then influential French Finance Minister jean-baptiste Colbert met during a meeting with businessmen of his own country
 The leadership of the team of traders was M
 Lee
 Was doing gendry a team of traders had reached Colbert with their problems
 In those days, traders were facing an ever increasing competition in the production system on the one hand, on the other hand government laws seemed binding on them
 After listening to them, Colbert expressed some resentment and said - "what can the government do to help businessmen in this?" Took on Gendry immediately responded in a simplistic tone - 'lease-now Fair
' His intention was, 'you leave us on our condition, let us only do our work
' As the popularity of this theory grew, Adam Smith gained recognition as an economist
 At that time Adam Smith did not know that he was representing such an economic theory, Which will one day prove to be revolutionary for the global economy
 Two years after the publication of the book titled 'nation's Wealth', Smith got the job of Commissioner in the Customs Department
 The same year he was shocked when he got the news of the death of his close friend and famous philosopher David Hume of his time
 The post of Custom Commissioner proved to be a challenge for Smith
 While in that position he had to deal with the problem of smuggling; Which he had established in his book The Wealth of Nations as 'universal deeds behind the face of unnatural legislation'
 When the Edinburgh Royal Society was established in 1783, Smith was named its founding member
 For Smith's special services in the field of economics and politics, he was nominated as Honorary Rector of Glasg University
 He remained unmarried for a lifetime
 Due to being busy in study and teaching night and day, his health started getting messed up
 vaichariki Adam Smith is considered one of the makers of the modern economy
 Inspired by his ideas, while socialist thinkers like Karl Marx, Engels, Mill, Ricardo carried forward their ideology, the seed of modern state economy is also rooted in Smith's ideas
 Smith's economic social thinking is contained in his two books
 The first book is titled - Principles of Moral Feeling "in which he has attempted to review human behavior
 The book is influenced by Smith teacher Francis Hutcheson
 In the book, moral philosophy has been divided into four classes - morality, virtue, sense of personal rights and freedom
 In this book, Smith classifies the entire moral behavior of man into two parts — 1
 Nature of morality 2
 Goal of ethics In the nature of morality, Smith has included property, desires etc
 While in the second category, Smith has reviewed human sensibilities, selfishness, longing etc
 Smith's second important book is 'exploring the nature of the wealth of the nation and its reasons' This unique book is in five volumes
 In the book, various topics such as political science, economics, human behavior etc
 have been considered, but it mainly analyzes Smith's economic ideas
 Smith, while supporting the free economy, has shown how to protect our interests in such times, how to make the maximum profit of technology, how a welfare state can be tested on the basis of religiosity and How can society be taken on the path of development through commercial competition
 Smith's ideology presents this analysis in a very objective way
 Smith has also been accused of being an individualist because of this book
 But scholars who consider Smith a staunch individualist may be shocked by the fact that most of his work is focused on human morality and public welfare
 In his second book, 'the Principle of Moral Perceptions', Smith writes —' How can the concept of a completely selfish person be well? There are definitely some principles of nature that make it necessary for him to relate his happiness to others, by which he does not get anything other than to see them happy
 ' The victim may think that there are really some laws of nature that can prove beneficial for him in the fate of others and happiness for him Can cause
 Whereas this is its sheer illusion
 He could not think of anything except this
 In one place, Smith has written, referring to the monotony and limitations of human behavior, that "we do not have an authentic experience of what the other person thinks
" Nor do we have any knowledge about what it actually affects
 Except that we can guess something by imagining ourselves to be in those circumstances
 We can also be relaxed by seeing our brother standing on the balcony, regardless of what is going on
 Our sensations remain dormant about his condition
 They neither go beyond our 'us', nor can they go; That is, we can only guess about its actual condition
 There is no power in his consciousness that can give us a real sense of his troubles and state of mind, until the time we think of ourselves by putting ourselves in his circumstances
 But our own thinking is only our thinking and concept, not his
 Through imagination, we are only able to guess his position
 '' Smith has given the exact position by the above quote
 a lot of our everyday behavior is done only through conjecture and imagination
 Smith has also taken the side of personal happiness without any hesitation while avoiding the unexpected pressures of emotion and morality
 According to him, loving himself, taking care of his comforts and making necessary efforts for him is not ineffective or immoral in any sense
 He said that life will become very difficult if our tender sensations and love, which is our core emotion, start controlling our behavior all the time, and there is no desire for the welfare of others; Or he started to consider the defense of his ego as the best, and neglecting others should become his religion
 Empathy and personal benefits are mutually complementary rather than conflicting with each other
 Humans continue to get opportunities to help others
 In a treatise called 'the wealth of nations', Smith explains benevolence and welfare in a very objective manner
 According to Smith, due to lack of practice, our psyche is not ready to accept such beliefs, although our conduct continues to point to the same
 The duality that exists within our heart keeps churning us
 At one place, he writes that it is impossible to fulfill the needs only on the basis of religion or charity
 The presence of personal interests is also mandatory for him
 He writes - 'our food is not a gift of kindness to a butcher, a wine-maker or a tandoorwala
 It is a reward for the work done for themselves, for their inherent benefit
 'according to the smith, if a man works hard for earning, it is his work done for his own happiness
 But its effect is not limited to that itself
 In the process of earning, he somehow connects with others
 They take their support and through their product, they fulfill the needs of their society as well
 In order to earn something in the competition, he has to produce something different from others
 The ratio of the specificity of production and the technology used for production determines its success
 In the treatise titled 'wealth of Nations', Smith writes that -' Every entrepreneur is constantly striving to make maximum profit on his investment amount
 He does this work for himself, only with his good wishes and not for the welfare of the society
 It is also true that for his own good, he tries to take his business as much as possible, expanding production and employment opportunities as much as possible
 But late in the process, society also has the benefit
 In the book 'wealth of Nations' written in five volumes, Smith has also tried to explain the reasons for the prosperity of a nation and their nature
 But his insistence has been to minimize control over the economy
 According to Smith, the first reason for prosperity is a favorable division of labor
 Here, the meaning of compatibility is to make the maximum productive by using the efficiency of any person
 An example of Smith to illustrate this fact has been very popular — imagine that ten artisans could make forty-eight thousand pins a day, provided that their production process is divided into individual parts
 Any special task of production process should be assigned
 Someday if even one of them is absent; One of them could hardly make a pin in a day
 Because the efficiency of a particular artisan is the ability to complete any one stage of the production process
 'smith was in favor of free trade
 He said that governments should take up all those laws which work to frustrate the producers by hindering the development of productivity
 He opposed the trade-related laws that were being run by tradition and said that such laws negatively impact productivity
 It has also opposed taxes levied in the name of imports and laws supporting it
 In the field of economics, his theory is known as 'lassé Fair'
 Which means - Let them work voluntarily
 In other words, Smith wanted his release of control for the smoothness of the production process
 He was in favor of specialization of production rather than expansion of production area, So that maximum benefit of mechanical skills and human labor is taken
 Production should be cheap and reach the maximum
 He said that - 'if any country is willing to give any item cheaper than the cost of production in our country, then it is our duty to buy it from there
 And plan the labor and resources of our country in such a way that it can be as effective as possible and we can take appropriate advantage of it
 Should be without any mutual benefit or desire
 The desire to produce is the basic driving force of entrepreneurship
 But there is no possibility of profit with production, if the law instead of helping, stands in its way, then its desire may also die
 In that case both that person and the nation are at a disadvantage
 According to Smith — 'consumption is directly related to production
 Any person produces because he wishes to produce
 On fulfilling the desire, he can opt out of the production process or even postpone the production process for some time
 When a person produces more than what he needs, at that time he wishes to take additional production, by which he can shuffle any other thing from another person
 If a person aspires for something and makes something else, then it may be his desire to produce that he can exchange it with the things that he desires and get well from him
 As he could have made them himself
 'smith considered the division of work completely natural and supported it in a free voice
 This shows his scientific vision and foresight
 On the basis of his ideas, America and European countries adopted the free economy
 The relevance of his ideas remains unchanged even after centuries
 Even radical communist countries like China and Russia remain advocates of free economy to remain in the industrial competition
 Analyzing different aspects of production, Smith said that the contribution of workers and artisans in the success of industries also does not diminish
 They invest in their labor skills and help them in production
 Smith has also written that in a place where it is difficult to understand the trend of production, the rates of wages can be higher than normal
 Because people, unless they have no additional benefit, will not like to learn
 The possibility of additional wages or higher than normal earnings motivates them to adopt the new method
 In this way, Smith has indicated specific symptoms of spontaneous mankind
 Similarly, such works where a person has to work in adverse conditions from the point of view of health or in factories running in unsafe places will have to keep the wages rates higher than normal
 Otherwise, people will continue to run for wages in safe and preferred locations and there will be a lack of trained personnel in such factories
 Smith has used the facts in every place in a very balanced and rational manner
 In his book 'wealth of Nations' he makes it clear that the difference in the trend of work can be balanced with the difference of salary
 a feature of his writing is also that he uses facts and arguments to explain the matter rather than a long description
 Smith's ideas about internationalization of the production system also meet the test of modern economy
 In this regard, he was of the opinion that - If a foreign country is ready to provide us with relatively cheaper consumer goods, it would be appropriate to order it from there
 Because only through that some productive power of our country will be used to carry out such works which are more important and beneficial
 Ultimately we will benefit from this arrangement
 'smith's installations during the analysis are not limited to merely describing the production technology of pins or simply showing the difference between the salaries of a butcher and a rickshaw puller
 Rather, on the pretext of this, he also works to solve the complex political issues of nations
 The trend of making international strategy through economic relations has become common nowadays
 Rich industrialized countries do this work with great efficiency
 But his seedling has existed in Smith's contemplation since the eighteenth century
 In the fourth book of the 'wealth of Nations' series, in 1776, Smith clearly told the British government that the expenditure on his American colonies was more than his own value
 Explaining the reason for this, he said that the British monarchy is a very expensive system
 He had proved on the basis of the data that instead of political control, a clean economy can be a more effective system for control
 He was in favor of keeping the government away from economic issues
 In this case, Smith was ahead of certain modern economists
 But if everything is to be done by the capitalists or the system created with their cooperation through economic policies, then what is the responsibility of the government? What can she do to maintain her supremacy? In this regard, Smith had a very clear view that the government is seeking patent law, contracts, Can maintain its control through arrangements such as license and copyright
 Not only this, the government can keep the works of public importance such as building bridges, roads, restrooms etc
 under its control, where people can benefit from the prosperity of the nation
 In priority areas, in areas where entrepreneurs have less interest to work, the government can discharge its duties by maintaining the pace of development
 Smith's ideas in support of the capital system are practical in many places, and sometimes he seems to be crossing the boundaries of redundancy
 He was supportive of turning the government into a complementary system rather than a self-governing authority
 Whose task is to help productivity as much as possible
 He also thought that citizens should also pay the prescribed fee in proportion to the use of facilities
 But this does not mean that Smith wanted to completely free governments from the responsibility of their citizens
 He believed — 'no society can be considered happy and prosperous as long as the majority of its members are poor, unhappy and depressed
' Smith was an advocate of free competition in terms of trade and production technology
 He believed that the arrival of competition in the field of economy would be in accordance with 'natural law'
 Smith's natural law is certainly an extension of the law of the forest, in which the survival of life makes the struggle mandatory
 The concept of cooperatives was not born in Smith's time, the idea of socialism was also in the womb of the development of public consciousness
 On one hand, he insisted on making the production more competitive by linking it to the competition
 On the other hand, by interconnecting production and morality, he showed the way to keep the face of the production system humane
 However, why should the bourgeoisie, which considers maximum profit as its best, follow morality without any selfishness, why should it be such a compulsion? He has not given any indication towards this
 Yet Smith's ideas have been the most original and influential in his time
 Smith had said earnestly that "in any civilized society, man needs the support and cooperation of others
" Whereas, to make a few friends, one life remains inadequate
 Among creatures, an organism moving towards adulthood is usually used to be lonely and independent
 Helping others is not a part of his nature
 But this is not the case with humans
 He is always worried about the welfare of his brothers and relatives for his selfishness
 Obviously, man expects the same for himself
 Because it is impossible for him to carry on with the wishes of the only person
 He will work to make his relationship even stronger, if he can make a place for himself in their pleasures
 He will also try to show that it is in his own interest to do all the tasks that he expects from them
 Whatever duty a man performs towards others, it is a kind of bargain - that is, you give me what i want, in return you will get everything you wish for
 This is the principle of giving something to someone, this is the only way through which our social relations get expanded and on whose support this world runs
 Our food is not a gift to the kindness of any butcher, winemaker or oven seller
 This is a byproduct of work done for themselves, for their inherent benefit
 'thus we see that Adam Smith's economic ideas are not only practical, original and far-sighted; Rather, even today, he is retaining his publicity
 Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that they are more relevant today than before
 In his ideology, we do not see any deviation of thoughts or sense of confusion
 Smith also had full faith in beliefs, which is why he could gather many facts to support his argument
 This is why Smith was as impressed by the economists that followed; No other economist of that period was able to do the same
 However, Adam Smith had to face criticism from the people for his views
 Some scholars think that his views are influenced by the book of Endorser Chandinius, 'the National Gain and David Hume'
 Some scholars have also accused him of promoting anarchic capitalism
 But it is only fair to assess the views of any scholar in its totality
 Scholars who assess Smith's ideas are often limited to industrial production ideas, forgetting that Smith's ideas of production include the duties of government and citizens
 However, his ideological sharpness has also been praised by his sharp opponents
 Many scholars and researchers of the world are still engaged in analyzing its economic principles
 If the relevance of the views of a scholar remains after centuries, then it is definitely a symbol of his greatness
 While Smith has not only influenced generations of scholars, but has also produced several generations of economists
 They forget that Smith's production ideas also include the duties of government and citizens
 However, his ideological sharpness has also been praised by his sharp opponents

 adam smith mukhyatah apni do rachanaaon ke liye jane jate hai- This fast is kept on Monday on the first day of the week
 yah vrath som yani chandra yaa shivaji ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 Once upon a time, Shri Bhoothnath Mahadev Ji along with Mata Parvati wished for a vihara in the dead land
 vidarbha desh kii amravati nagari jo ki sabhi sukhon se paripurna thi vahaan padhaare
 vahaan ke raja dwaara ek atyant sundar shiv mandir tha, jahaan ve rahane lage
 Once Parvati ji desired to disturb Chaucer
 tabhi mandir main pujari ke pravesh karanbe par mataji ne poocha ki is baazi main kiski jeet hogi? to brahman ne kaha ki mahadev ji kii
 But Parvati ji won
 tab brahman ko unhone jhooth bolne ke aparaadh main kodhi hone kaa shraap diya
 After several days, Devlok's Apsaras, entered the temple and seeing him, asked the reason
 The priest said everything without any hesitation
 tab apsaraon ne dhants bandhaaya or solah somvaar ke vratra rakhane ko bataaya
 On asking the method, he also explained the method as mentioned above
 With this, all wishes are fulfilled by the grace of Shiva
 fir apsaraayein swarg ko chalin gayin
 The Brahmin fasted on Mondays and spent his life free from disease
 kuch din uparaant shiv parvati ji ke padhaarney par, parvati ji ne uske rogamukt hone kaa karan poocha
 tab brahman ne sari katha bataayi
 tab parvati ji ne bhi yahi vrath kiya or unki manokamana purna hui
 His wrathful son Karthikeya was obedient to his mother
 But Karthikeya ji asked the reason for his change of mind
 Then Parvati ji told the same story to him as well
 Then Swami Karthikeya Ji also observed the same fast
 unki bhi ichha purna hui
 His friend Brahmin asked him to do the same fast
 fir vah brahman videsh gaya or ek raaj ke yahaan swayamvar main gaya
 There the king pledged that a rosary would put a garland around whose neck he would marry his daughter
 vahaan shiv krupa se hathini ne maala us brahman ke gale main daal di
 The king married her daughter to him
 us kanya ke poochne par brahman ne use katha bataayi
 tab us kanya ne bhi vahi vrath kar ek sundar putr paaya
 Later that son also did the same fast and got the kingdom of an old king
 jab vah nayaa raja somvaar kii puja karne gaya, to uski patni ashraddha hone se nahin gayi
 At the end of the worship, Akash uttered that Rajan should leave this girl, otherwise your apocalypse may die
 Finally he expelled the queen from the kingdom
 vah rani bhukhi pyaasi roti hui duusare nagar main pahunchi
 vahaan ek budhiya use mili, jiske saath vah He found an old woman who made threads
 usee ke saath kaam karne lagi par dusre din jab wo dhaagaa bechney nikali to achaanak tej hawa chali or saare dhaage ud gaye to malkin ne gusse main aakar use kamse nikaal diya
 Then she reached the house of a Teli while weeping, she kept it but when she went to the treasury house, the oil pots fell and if the oil ran out, she threw it out of the house
 is prakaar sabhi jagah se nikaale jane ke baad vah ek sundar van me pahaunchi vahaan ke talab se pani pine ke liye jab badhi to talab sukh gaya thoda pani bachaa jo ki kito se yukt tha
 Drinking the same water, she sat under a tree, but immediately the leaves of that tree fell
 is tarah wo jis vriksh ke neeche se guzarati vah vriksh patto se viheen ho jaataa aise hi sara van hi sukhane ko aayaa
 Seeing this, some shepherds took the queen to a Shiva temple priest
 vahaan ranine pujari ke aagrah se sari baat bataayi or sun kar pujari ne kaha kii tumhe shiv kaa shraap laga he
 When the queen begged, the priest told her the remedy for its diagnosis and told about the Monday fast
 rani ne tan man se vrath puraa kiya or shiv kii kripa se satrahave somvaar ko raja kaa man parivartan hua
 The king sent messengers to find the queen
 pataa lagane ke baad raja ne bulaava bheja par pujari ne kaha raja ko swayan bhejo
 The king thought on this and reached himself
 rani ko lekar darvaar pahuche or unka sthaan diya
 The whole city was celebrated with happiness, the king offered alms to the poor and as a devotee of Shiva, started fasting on Monday for 16 Monday and after going through all the happiness of the world went to Shivdham
 is prakaar jo bhi man lagaakar shraddha purvak niyamase 16 somvaar kaa brat karegaa vah is lokme param sukh ko praapt kar ant me paralok me mukti ko praapt hoga

 The academy announces the name of the selected winner in early October

 There has also been a dispute that political interest is hidden in the nomination of this award and more recently in the final selection of literary winners

 Under Marxist ideology, illusory consciousness is considered to be a state in which the proletariat itself is not aware of which political party-group, ideology its interests are actually associated with and its actual role in history
 ve aisi vichaardhaara ke prabhaav main rahete hai jo unke hiton ke viruddh hoti he
 By creating a false consciousness, the ruling class maintains the conditions of oppression and exploitation of the proletariat and the proletariat itself accepts that exploitation as right
 marks ne apni prasiddh kriti communist menifesto main likhaa he ki kisi bhi daur ke shaasha varg ke vichaar hi shaasha-vichaar hote hai
 That is, the thoughts of the ruling class become the most influential views
 is saamaajik chetana tathaa prabhaavshaalee vichaaron kaa sambandh bhi bhrant chetana se he kyonki sarvhaara nijee chetana ke vikaas ke sthaan par shaasha varg dwaara viksit chetana ko apana letaa he
 According to Marx, it is imposition ie false consciousness
 kalantar main sarvhaara yah samajhane lagata he ki sattarudh varg ne vaastaviktaa ke prati jo chetana paidaa kii he, vah unke varg hiton ke anuroop nahin he or phir bhrant chetana ke sthaan par vaastavik varg-chetana paidaa ho jaati he
 This concept is also analyzed under the interpretation of class-consciousness and ideology
 varg-chetana vah dasha he jisamen sarvhaara swayan ko vishesh varg kaa sadsy maanata he
 Marx has divided this class-consciousness into the categories of 'class in itself' and 'class for itself'
 isamen pehali shrenee vah dasha he jisamen koi saamaajik samooh ek sajhi aarthik sthiti kaa ang hota he or vah us sthiti ko sweekaar karke chalata he
 The biggest contribution of illusory consciousness is in the creation of a state of accepting and not resisting the situation, whereas class for itself is the condition of class consciousness in which the proletariat is free from any kind of illusory consciousness and ideology of real class consciousness
 Grows and he becomes aware of his historical exploits
 marks ke anusaar yah parivartan vishesh bhautik paristhitiyon ke adheen hota he jisamen poonjeewaad pradhan hota he or poonjeewaad ke kaaran hi utpaadan paddati samuhik ho jaati he or is samuhikta ke kaaran vyaktvaad kaa vichaar sarvhaara kii drushti main mahatvapurn nahin rah jaataa he
 The behavior of the term illusory consciousness is not found in Marx's texts
 darasal, marks ke hi abhinn sahyogi angels ne sarvapratham iskaa prayog kiya tha
 But the ideology used by Marx and the meaning of the words 'puja-puja' are considered close to it
 marks ne multah varg kii ek vastugat dharna prastut kii jo ki samaaj ke aarthik sambandhon par tiki vyavastha ke vastugat vivechan par aadhaarit thi
 The social class of any person is determined on the basis of production and property relations in the society
 par ek saamaajik varg kaa sadsy hote hue bhi vyakti kii bahut sari nijee visheshtaayen tathaa nijee dharanaayen hoti hai jo vichaaron, manorachna evam asmitaaon ke roopon par aadhaarit hoti hai
 These occult beliefs only provide an ideological framework to a person under which one understands his role in society and formulates opinions about the influencing forces of his life
 par kisi bhi varg- vibhajit samaaj main samaaj ke visheshadhikaar praapt tathaa adhinsth varg ke bich dwandvapurn sambandh maujuud rahete hai
 According to Marx, the entire social system is such that it produces wrong, distorted images of reality in a very systematic way in the consciousness of the proletariat
 agar aisa nahin kiya jayega to samaaj kaa shoshit varg apane shoshan ke vaastavik kaarnon kaa jaan legaa tathaa daman va utpeedan kii vyavastha ko ukhaad phenkega
 Therefore, at the level of politics, religion, business, spirituality, etc
, such a system is created by which false consciousness and ideological domination can be created
 ullekhneey he ki marks ne vichaardhaara kaa siddhant apni pustak da german idialji main prastut kiya he or vichaardhaara ko aisa madhyam bataaya he jo manushya ko apni sristi tathaa samaaj ko samajhane main sahaayta pradaan karti he
 In the whole philosophy of Marx, ideology is not independent of other things but relies on them
 khaas taur par kisi kaal vishesh main bhautik sthitiyon tathaa utpaan sambandhon par vichaardhaara kaa swaroop nirbhar hota he
 That is why Marx wrote in his creation opposing the existing sentimental philosophy schools: 'consciousness does not determine the social existence of man, but social existence itself determines his consciousness
 utpaadan ke rup badalane ke saath naye varg or swaamitv bhi paidaa hote hai
 In Marx's own words: 'in handloom society, feudal rulers are there, while the development of steam-based mills comes to power in the hands of industrial capitalists
 virgon ke is roopantaran main vichaardhaara ek varg kaa duusare varg par varchasv banaaye rakhane main badi bhoomika adaa karti he or usee se bhrant chetana kaa bhi nirmaan hota he
 ' marks ne panya-puja kii avadharana kaa vikaas apane prasiddh granth das capital main kiya he
 Through this concept, he has explained the conditions that contribute to making the reality blurred, unclear and illusory in the society engaged in commodity production
 kisi vastu ke bare main najariye tathaa bodh kaa nirmaan keval uske mulya se kiya jaataa he or kin utpaadan sambandhon ke bich us vastu kaa utpaadan hua, ise andekha kar diya jaataa he
 The price of shoes made in a shoe stitching factory is seen only in the market while the labor of the worker who makes the shoes is ignored
 marks ke mutabik is tarah kaa rahasyikaran saamaajik utpaadan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he or isi ke zariye bazaar aadhaarit samaaj daman or shoshan par aadhaarit un maalik-majdoor sambandhon par pardaa daal detaa he, jisapar vah swayan nirbhar hota he
 The concept of illusory consciousness can also be understood from the theories of base and superstructure propounded by Marx
 samaaj kii bhautik dashaayen hi aadhaar hoti hai or unamem aane vaale parivartanon se hi saamaajik sambandhon main bhi parivartan aate hai
 While the superstructure consists of educational, legal, political institutions, values, methods of thinking, religion, ideologies and philosophies etc
 inhen ke madhyam se bhautik sthitiyon main maujuud samant-kisaan, mazdoor-maalik aadi shoshanparak sambandhon kii hifaazat kii jaati he or jab samaaj ke sabhi sadsy adhirachana main maujuud in shoshanprad vichaaron ko sweekaar kar lete hai to use hi bhrant chetana kii adheenta swikaarne ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Later thinkers such as Karl Manheim, Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusse, etc
, analyzed the ideology and political institutions in detail and highlighted the illusory consciousness
 french darshanik lui alathuse ne ise shram-shakti ke punarutpaadan ke jaruri upkaran ke rup main vishleshit kiya he
 According to Althuse, the reproduction of labor force depends on two things
 pehla, aavashyak hunar kaa punarutpaadan or doosraa, shaasha vargeey vichaardhaara va shramikon ke khaas samajikaran kaa utpaadan jisase takneekee rup se daksh evam aagyaakaari-paradheen shramashakti kaa nirmaan hota he
 Althuse also said that no class can maintain its supremacy by merely exercising power but ideological control has to be done for class rule as well
 alathuse ke anusaar shaskawargeey vichaardhaara kaa punarutpaadan khaas tareeke se hota he jise unhone idialgical state aprits kaa naam diya jisamen jansanchaar madhyam, kanoon, dharm, shiksha aadi sabhi sammilit hai
 Ideological State Apparatus, through education, etc
, propagates the ideology of the ruler and creates misleading consciousness among the subordinate classes and keeps them in a state of subordination
 italy ke vampanthi vichaarak gramshi ne bhrant chetana tathaa varg chetana ko vichaardhaara tathaa prabhutv ke sandarbh main vishesh taur par vyakhyayit kiya or kaha ki sarvhaara apane saanskrithik-saamaajik pratikon kaa prayog kar varchasvvaadi vichaardhaara kaa pratirodh kar saktaa he or is prakaar itihaas main shaktishaalee varg kii vichaardhaara kii niskriyatapurna tareeke se adheenta sweekaar karne se inkaar kar saktaa he

 Modernism, in its broadest definition, is modern thinking, character, or practice
 More specifically, the term originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, largely from the wide-ranging and remote cultural trends in Western society
 Describes both a group of people and an array of associated cultural movements

 Modernism rejected the latent certainty of enlightenment thinking, and the existence of a compassionate, all-powerful Creator

 Clement Greenberg called Emanuel Kant "the first real modernist", but also wrote, "the emergence of what can safely be called modernism, relatively locally in France, in Baudelaar in literature and manet in painting and in prose fiction Probably happened to Flaubert in the middle of the last century

 The sufferings and possibilities of industrial urbanism arising from the scientific examination of subjects led to many changes that shook European civilization, which up to that time considered itself the fountain of the continuous and progressive line of development from the Renaissance

 Many modern scriptures refer to their pre-twentieth century forms as "classical"
 yah antar un parivartanon ke kshetra ko darshata he jo is avadhi ke dauraan bade paimaane par hone vaali vaigyanik evam saanskrithik gatividhiyon ke saath hua tha
 In the 1890s, a war of thinking began to emphasize that in the light of current techniques, instead of merely reiterating knowledge of the past, past norms needed to be completely removed
 kala ke kshetra main apana sir uthaane vaala aandolan bhautikee main saapekshata kaa siddhant; aatanrik dahan ingine evam audyogikaran kaa badhata ekikaran; or saarvajanik niti main saamaajik vigyaan kii vardhit bhoomika jaise vikaason ke saath-saath chalata rahaa

 The theories of Sigmund Freud and Ernst Mäck were powerful inspirations in this wave of modernism, who argued in the early 1880s that the brain had a fundamental structure and that subjective experience was based on the interaction of parts of the brain 
 frid ke vichaaron ke anusaar sabhi vyaktiparak vaastaviktaa mul prerana or sahaj gyaan kii bhoomika par aadhaarit thi jiske jariye bahari duniya kii kalpana kii gai thi
 Ernst Maek developed a well-known philosophy in science often called "positivism", according to which there was no guarantee of the relationship of objects in nature but only through a kind of mental shorthand
 isane ateet se ek algaav kaa pratinidhitiv kiya, jisamen pehle yahi mana jaataa tha ki bahari evam nirpeksh vaastaviktaa apane aap, jaisi yah thi, ek vyakti par par prabhaav daal sakati thi, jaise ki, udhaaharan ke taur par, jon loke kaa anubhavvaad, ek achoote yuva mastishk ke rup main shuruyaat karne vaale mastishk ke saath hota tha
 Freud's description of subjective conditions, including a stun brain filled with counterbalanced self-imposed restrictions and initial impulses, was combined by Carl Jung with a belief in the natural essence to contract a collective unconscious that is the original substance
 The study was replete with conscious brains fighting or hugging
 darwin kii rachana ne logon ke man main "maanav, pashu" kii avadharana ko prastut kiya tha or jang ke drushtikon ne suzav diya ki saamaajik mandandon kaa ulanghan karne ke prati logon ke aaveg bachapanaa yaa agyanta kaa fal nahin tha, balki maanav pashu ke aavashyak se vyutpann tha
 Friedrich Nietzsche was in favor of a philosophy in which force, particularly the 'desire to provide power', was more important than facts and things
 isi tarah, henry bergesan kii rachanaaen vaastaviktaa kii sthitik avadharanaon par mahatvapurn 'jivan bal' kii pakshpaati thi
 All these authors united through a romantic mistrust of Victorian positivism and certainty
 Instead he favored it, or, in Freud's case, attempted to explain the processes of irrational thinking in terms of rationality or perfection
 yah paripurna shabdon main soch ke prati sadiyon se chali aa rahi pravriti se judaa hua tha, jisamen tantra-mantra main ek vardhit ruchi or "pranashakti" shaamil thi
 This collision of ideas derived from Romanticism and an attempt to find a way to explain a hitherto unknown fact led to the arrival of the first wave of compositions, which, while the authors of these compositions expounded the current trends in art, It was believed that the artist broke the contract with the general public that the artists were lecturers and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas

 This wave of modern activity severed its connection to the past in the first decade of the twentieth century and attempted to redefine various forms in a revolutionary way

 Artistic modernism influenced celebrities outside of this activity; John Maynard Keynes, for example, was a friend of Woolf and other writers of the Bloomsbury group

 In 1907, Picasso was painting his Demoiselles d'avignon, Oskar Kokoshka was writing his mortar, Höfnung der Frauen, the first expressionist play, and Arnold Schoenberg composed his string quartet # 2 in f-sharp Minor , Which was his first "music center-less" composition

 These activities gave him a new meaning, dubbed 'modernism': it embraced discontinuity and unacceptable uninterrupted change in everything from biology to fictional character development and filmmaking
 It allowed for the disintegration, rejection or exclusion of simple realism in literature and art, and the rejection of ragini in music or the dramatic alteration of it
 This set modernists apart from 19th-century artists, who tended to believe not only in smooth change, but also in the progressiveness of such change — 'progress'
 dicans or tolstoy jaise lekhak, turnar jaise chitrakaar or brahams jaise sangeetkaar 'kattarpanthi' yaa 'bohemian' nahin the, balki samaaj ke moolyawaan sadsy the jinhone kala kaa nirmaan kiya jise samaaj main, yahaan tak ki kabhi-kabhi iske kam vaanchhneeya pahaluon kii pratyaalochana karte samay bhi, shaamil kiya gaya
 Modernism, while still "progressive," saw progressively restricting traditional forms and traditional social systems as progress, and therefore reintroduced the artist as a deposed, revolutionary rather than enlightened
 bhavishyavaad is pravriti kii misaal detaa he
 In 1909, the Paris newspaper Le Figaro created F
 Published the first manifesto of T
 Marinetti

 Such manifestos, modeled on the famous "communist manifesto" model of the last century, presented ideas that were meant to excite and mobilize followers

 However, the Great War and the subsequent accidents were a cataclysmic uplift that concerned artists such as the Brahms of the late 19th century and was embraced by art-pioneers

 Also, mankind was making slow and continuous moral progress, this approach seemed ridiculous in the face of meaningless killing
 The First World War has forgotten the rigid mechanical radical understanding of technology with the terrible irrationality of myth

 Each of these "modernism," as some observers labeled it at the time, emphasized new ways to produce new results
 Then, Impressionism became a precursor that severed ties to the idea of national schools which artists and writers adopted as ideas of international movements
 atiyatharthwaad, ghanavaad, bauhaus or leninavaad sabhi un aandolanon ke udhaaharan hai jisane badi teji se ise apnaane waalon ko unki bhugolic mul se koson dur unhen sthapit karte hai
 The exhibition, theater, cinema, book and building all served to reinforce people's perception of the notion that times were changing

 By 1930, modernism had achieved a place in other establishments, including political and artistic establishments, although by this time modernism itself had changed

 Modernism consisted of attempts to fight its universal principles and a series of sometimes contradictory reactions to a similar perceived situation
 ant main aksar 18veen sadi ke gyanoday ke model ko grahan karke vigyaan or vaigyanik chetana, tark or sthirataa ke strot ke rup dikhaai dene lage, jabaki nutan mashin yug kii pratiyamanatah sahajagyaan-virdohi krityon ke saath-saath buniyadi aadim yon evam achet preranaon ko mul bhaavnaatmak padaarth ke rup main grahan kiya gaya
 From these two seemingly incompatible pillars, modernists engaged in the task of designing a complete life philosophy that had the potential to embody every aspect of life
 1930 tak, aadhuniktawaad ne lokapriy samskruti main pravesh kar liya tha
 With the increasing urbanization of the population, it was seen as a source to deal with the challenges of the day
 When modernism was attracted towards the academic community, it was developing a conscious theory of its own importance
 lokapriy samskruti, jo ucch samskruti se nahin balki apane swayan kii vaastaviktaaon se vyutpann hua tha, ne aadhuniktaavaadi navachaar ko kaaphi prerit kiya

 Younger writers and comedians like Perelman and James Thurber began publishing new and modern ideas
 Modern ideas in art appeared in advertisements and logos, the most famous of which was the London Underground logo designed by Edward Johnston in 1919, an early example of the need for clear, easily recognizable and memorable visual symbols

 In Britain and America, modernism as a literary movement is generally considered to be relevant until the early 1930s, and the term "modernist" is rarely used, especially for writers after 1945

 The post-war period left Europe's capitals in a state of turmoil, with the need to rebuild economically and materially and to regroup politically
 The art environment in Paris was a mess

 kuch had tak polak ko ehsaas hua ki ek kalakriti ke nirmaan kii yatra utana hi mahatvapurn tha jitna ki khud vah kalakriti thi
 Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinvention of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century through cubism and built sculpture, Polak redefined the way art was created
 chitrafalak chitrakala or abhismay se dur unka sthanantaran unke yug ke kalakaaron or unke baad aane vaale sabhi kalakaaron ke liye ek mukti sanket tha
 Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process — placing a compressed raw canvas on the floor where it could be invaded from all sides using artistic and industrial materials; By dripping and throwing a linear color group; By painting, painting and brushing; By using imagination and non-imagination — it inevitably gave rise to artistry beyond any prior boundary
 Abstract expressionism broadened and developed the definitions and possibilities commonly available to artists for the creation of new artworks
 anya amoort abhivyanjanavadiyon ne apane khud kii naveen safaltaaon ke saath polak kii safalataa kaa anusaran kiya
 In a way, the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyford Still, Barnett Newman, Ed Reinhardt, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkus, and others have all diversified the art
 And opened the entire gates of the area
 However, the reprint of abstract art by art historians such as Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, and Catherine de Zegher suggests that leading female artists who introduced major innovations in modern art were ignored by the official details of its history Was

 However, by the late 1960s, postmodernism, process art and Arte Povera also appeared through the lyrical abstractions and postmodernist movements and in early conceptual art, as revolutionary concepts and movements that included both early painting and sculpture

 The movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on interpretive and psychological intimacy in favor of art consumerism, advertising and iconography showcasing the material consumer culture of the prolific production era
 The early acts of David Hockney and the works of Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi were considered fundamental examples of this movement
 is bich neuyork ke east village ke 10wein street kii gailariyon ke downtaun drishy main kalakaar pop kala ke ek america sanskaran ko sutarabaddh kar rahe the

 The master of humor is a connection between the rebellious Dadaists named Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, and the radical acts of pop artists such as Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings used a technique called bande dots used in commercial reproduction
 Reproduced the perspective

 atisookshmavaad ne tark diya ki atyadhik saadagi kala main aavashyak sabhi vishisht pradarshan par kabza kar sakati thi
 The minimalism in the field of painting is a modernist movement, unlike other fields, receiving the support of painters like Frank Stella
 atisookshmavaad ko naanaa prakaar se yaa to uttaradhuniktawaad kaa ek agradoot, yaa khud ek uttaradhunik aandolan samajha jaataa he
 In the latter approach, early minimalism led to advanced modernist acts, but this movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists, such as Robert Morris, changed direction in favor of the anti-construction movement
 hill foster apane da crooks of minimlism naamak niabandh main us had tak jaanch karte hai jis had tak donald jud or robert morris donon atisookshmavaad ke apane prakashit paribhaashaon main greenbergavaadi aadhuniktawaad ko sweekaar or uskaa vistaar karte hai
 He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but "a paradigm shift of postmodern practices that still extend today"
 1960 ke dashak ke antim daur main robert pinkos-vitten ne atisookshmavaadi-vyutpann kala kaa varnan karne ke liye uttantisookshmavaad shabd kii rachana kii jisamen ve saamagree or praasangik maksadon nihit the jinhen atisookshmavaad ne tyaag diya tha
 pincus-whiten used the term for the works of Eva Hayes, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra, and former minimalists such as Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, and Sol Levitt, and new works by Barry Leva, and other celebrities
 donald jud, dan flayvin, karl andre, agnes martin, jon mccracen or anya sahit anya atisookshmavaadi apane kariyar kii shesh avadhi tak antim daur kii aadhuniktaavaadi chitrakala or murtikla kaa nirmaan karte rahe
 In the 1960s, the works of art-leading minimalist composers such as La Monte Young, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley also gained prominence in the New York art world
 uske baad se, kai kalakaaron ne atisookshmavaadi or uttantisookshmavaadi shaileyon ko apanaaya he or un par "uttaradhunik" hone kaa label lag gaya he
 The emergence of a combination of objects created with artist materials, moving away from previous traditions of painting and sculpture, was related to abstract expressionism
 robert roshanberg kii kriti is pravriti kii ek misaal he
 His "batches" of the 1950s were pioneers of pop art and installation art and used a collection of large material objects, including stuffed animals, birds, and commercial photographs
 roshanberg, jasper johns, laire reverse, jon chemberlen, cless oldenberg, jorge segal, gym dine or edward kinholz kii ginati amoort or pop donon tarah kii kalaon ke pramukh agraduton main kii jaati thi
 By creating a new tradition of art-making, he made serious contemporary art cycles acceptable for radical insertion into his works of improbable materials
 Another precursor to aggregated painting was Joseph Cornell, whose well-known amplified acts were seen as radical because of both the use of his objects and personal iconography
 20veen sadi ke armbh main marcel ducamp ne ek mutralay ko ek murtikla ke rup main pradarshit kiya
 He expressed his intention that people see the urinal as if it was an artwork because they said it was an artwork
 vah apane krity ko "radimeads" krity ke rup main sandarbhit karte the
 The Fountain was a urinal on which the pseudonym R
 Mat had a signature, whose exhibition in 1917 surprised the art world
 It and Duchamp's other acts are generally labeled Dada
 ducamp ko vaicharik kala ke ek agradoot ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, anya prasiddh udaahranon main jon kej kaa 4'33" or roshanberg kaa irezd de kooning kaa pramukh sthaan he, 4'33" chaar minute taintis second kii chuppi he
 Many thoughtful actions assume the position that art is the result of an object's viewer or work as an art, not the intrinsic quality of the act itself
 In this way, as the fountain was exhibited, it was a sculpture
 marcel ducamp ne prasiddhipurvak shatranj ke paksh main "kala" kaa parityag kar diya
 kala-agrani sangeetkaar david tuder ne reunion naamak ek lekh kii rachana kii jise unhone lowell cross ke saath milakar likhaa tha, jo ek aise shatranj ke khel ko darshata he jisamen prayek chaal ek prakashwan prabhaav yaa prakshepan ko shuru karata he
 Duchamp and Cage played the game at the premiere of the act
 steven best or duglas kelnar roshanberg evam jasper johns kii pahchaan aadhuniktawaad evam uttaradhuniktawaad ke darmyaan, marcel ducamp dwaara prerit, sankramanakalin charan ke hisse ke rup main karte hai
 Both used images of ordinary objects or objects themselves in their creations while maintaining the essence of high modernism and the spirit of the painter
 nav-dada se jude kala main ek or pravriti ek saath asankhya vibhinn madhyam kaa istemaal he
 Intermediately, the term was invented by Dick Higgins to convey new forms along the lines of fluxus, tangible poetry, received objects, performance art, and computer art

 In the late 1950s and 1960s, interested artists began to push the boundaries of contemporary art
 Yves Klein in France and Carolee Schneeman in New York City, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman, and Yoko Ono were pioneers of performance-based artifacts
 julian bek evam judith malina ke saath da living theatre jaise samoohon ne murtikaron or chitrakaaron ke saath milakar vaataavaran taiyaar karne main sahyog kiya or moulik rup se khaas taur par apni rachana paradise nau main darshak or pradarshak ke bich ke sambandh ko badal diya

 They were characterized by the reductionist philosophies of minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressiveness of abstract expressionism
 isi avadhi ke dauraan vibhinn kala-agrani kalakaaron ne tamaashon kaa nirmaan kiya
 The spectacles were mysterious and often spontaneous and unwritten conferences of artists and their friends and relatives in various designated locations, often involving incompatibility, materiality, costumes, spontaneous nudity, and various random or symbolic unrelated acts
 in tamaashon ke ullekhneey rachanakaaron main alan capro, cless oldenberg, gym dine, red grums or robert whitman shaamil the
 The performance art of Alan Capro attempted to integrate art and life
 tamaashon ke madhyam se jivan, kala or darshak ke bich kaa algaav dhundhala ho jaataa he
 These spectacles allow the artist to experiment with body movements, recorded sound, written and perceived text, and even odor
 alan capro ke sabase aarambhik tamaashon main se ek "hapanings in da neuyork seen" tha jisaki rachana 1961 main kii gai thi jis samay is kalaroop kaa vikaas ho rahaa tha
 In 1958, Capro published an essay entitled "the Legacy of Jackson Pollock"

 In this particular lesson, he uses the word "tamasha" for the first time, saying that craftsmanship and durability should be forgotten and mortal materials should be used in art
 uttaradhunik shabd se judy kala kii ek or pravriti ekasaath asankhya media kaa upyog he
 Intermediately, the term was invented by Dick Higgins to convey new forms along the lines of fluxus, tangible poetry, received objects, performance art, and computer art
 higgins samathing alls press ke prakaashak, ek moort kavi, kalakaar ellison noles ke pati or marcel ducamp ke ek prashansak the
 Ihab Hasan includes "intermedia, fusion of forms, illusion of rights" in his list of features of postmodern art
 "multi-media kala" ke sabase aam tareekon main se ek video-tepe or siarti monitoron kaa upyog he, jise video kala kii sangya di gai he
 Although the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old and has been revived from time to time, postmodern expression is often associated with performance art, where the theatrical subtext is removed and all that remains
 It is an artist's dubious specific statement or conceptual statement of his works
 fluxs kaa namakaran or nirbaadh rup se iskaa aayojan lithuania main janme jorge maciunas naamak ek america kalakaar ne 1962 main kiya
 Fluxus began to receive nominations from John Cage's 1957 to 1959 experimental structure classes at New York City's New School for Social Research
 unke chaatro main se kai kalakaar the jo anya media main kaam karte the jinhen sangeet kii thodi bahut jaankaree yaa bilkul jaankaree nahin thi
 Cage's students included Fluxus founding members Jackson Mc Low, Al Hansen, George Brecht and Dick Higgins

 Fluxus artists preferred working with available materials and creating their own creations or collaborating with their partners in the construction process
 andriyaaz husain uttaradhuniktawaad ke liye fluxs kaa daawa "yaa to uttaradhuniktawaad ke master-code yaa antat apradarshneey kala aandolan - maano yah uttaradhuniktawaad kii uttam style ho" ke rup main karne ke prayaason kii aalochana karte hai
 Instead he sees Fluxus as a major neo-dadaist phenomenon within the art-pioneer tradition

 The continuation of abstract expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstractions, linear abstractions, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, post-minimalism and other modernist movements of late 20th century painting and sculpture persisted in the first decade of the 21st century and Radicals in those mediums set new directions
 21veen sadi ke mode par, sar anthony kaaro, lucian frid, sai twombli, robert roshanberg, jasper johns, agnes martin, al held, elsworth keli, hellen francntheller, frank stela, kenneth noland, julls olitsaki, cless oldenberg, gym dine, james rozencist, elex catz, philip parlstin jaise supratishthit kalakaaron or brice marden, chak chlose, sam gilium, ijak vitkin, shaun skali, joseph nechwatal, elizabeth mure, laire poons, richard serra, walter darbi banard, laire zoks, roni landfield, ronaald davis, dan christenson, joel shapiro, tom oternes, joan snidar, ross bleknar, archi rand, suzan kril jaise yuva kalakaaron ne mahatvapurn evam prabhaavshaalee chitrakalaon or murtiyon kaa nirmaan karnaa jari rakhaa
 However, by the early 1980s the postmodern movement in art and architecture began to consolidate its position through various conceptual and intermedia formats
 Postmodernism in music and literature, even earlier, according to some, by the 1950s, had begun to strengthen its grip
 jabaki uttaradhuniktawaad aadhuniktawaad ke ant ke baad se lagu hota he, kai siddhantvaadiyon or vidwaanon kaa tark he ki uttar aadhuniktawaad 21veen sadi main bhi kaayam he
 Many modernists believed that by abandoning tradition they could invent radically new ways of producing art
 arnold shoenberg ne paramparaagat tanvaale sadbhaav, sangeet kii rachanaaon kaa nirmaan karne kii padanukramit pranali ko tyaag diya jisane kam se kam dedh dashak tak sangeet nirmaan kaa pathpradarshan kiya tha
 He believed that he had invented an entirely new way of composing music based on the use of twelve-tone lines

 Vasily Candinsky, Pete Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich all believed in redefining art as an arrangement of pure color
 photography ne aadhuniktawaad ke is pahalu ko bahut zyada prabhavit kiya, jisane drishy kala ke adhikansh pratinidhityawadee krityon ko gatkaalik bana diya tha
 However, these artists also believed that by abandoning the depiction of material objects, they had helped to move art from a materialistic stage of development to a spiritualist phase
 anya aadhuniktaavaadiyon, vishesh rup se jo dizine main antarbhukt the, ke vichaar adhik vyaavhaarik the
 Modernist architects and designers believed that new technology made old styles of buildings obsolete
 Le Corbizier's view was that buildings should function as "machines of residence", corresponding to cars, which they saw as machines of travel
 jis tarah kaaron ne ghodon kii jagah le lee thi, thik usee tarah aadhuniktaavaadi dizine ko pracheen misr yaa madhya yug se chali aa rahi puraani shaileyon or sanrachanaon ko tyaag dena chahie
 kuch maamalon main rup ne kaaryon kaa adhikraman kiya
 Following this machine aesthetic principle, modernist designers generally abandoned decorative motifs in design and preferred to emphasize materials used and pure linear forms
 neuyork main ludwig mies vine der rohe kii sigram building jaise gaganchumbi imaarat adyaprarupiy aadhuniktaavaadi imaarat ban gaye
 Modernist design of houses and furniture also generally emphasized simplicity and clarity of form, free-plan interior parts and lack of clutter
 Modernism reversed 19th-century public and private relations: In the 19th century, public buildings were spread horizontally for various technical reasons, and private buildings emphasized the perpendicular form to accommodate more private space on increasingly limited land

 Such practical considerations were less important in other arts

 This aspect of modernism often seems to be a reaction to consumer culture that developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century
 jabaki adhikansh nirmaataa un utpaadon kaa nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai jiskaa variyataon or pratikul prabhaavon ke aakarshan ke jariye vipanan kiya jayega, ucch aadhuniktaavaadiyon ne paaramparik soch ko kamjor banane ke liye is tarah ke upabhoktavaadi drushtikonon ko tyaag diya

 According to Greenberg, modernism set up a backlash against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial popular music, Hollywood, and advertising
 Greenberg linked it to the revolutionary rejection of capitalism
 kuch aadhuniktaavaadiyon ne apane aapako ek krantikari samskruti ke hisse ke rup main dekha jisamen raajnneetik kranti shaamil thi
 Others abandoned traditional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of political consciousness was of much greater importance than a change of political structures

 The rejection of its tradition was and is the most controversial aspect of the modern movement
 aadimavad, kattarpanth, prayog or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par aadhuniktawaad kaa jor paaramparik ummiido kii upeksha karata he
 In many art forms, this often meant to surprise and alienate audiences with the use of excessive dissonance and unevenness in modernist music, or as strange and arbitrary effects of powerful and painful combinations of motifs in surrealism
 sahitya main isamen aksar upanyaason main spasht kathankon yaa charitrankan kaa tyaag, yaa spasht vyakhya kii upeksha karne vaale kavy kii rachana shaamil hoti thi
 After the rise of Stalin, the Soviet communist government abandoned modernism on the basis of perceived transcendentalism, although it had previously supported futurism and constructionism

 naziyon ne dijanret art sheershak vaali ek pradarshnee main maansik rup se biimaar kalakaaron kii rachanaaon ke saath-saath aadhuniktaavaadi chitrakalaon kaa bhi pradarshan kiya
 The accusation of "formalism" could have resulted in the end of one's career, or a worse condition

 Louis a The mother-in-law compared insanity, especially schizophrenia and modernism, in a slightly less fascist manner, citing her shared discordant narratives, real images and disorganization

 However, after World War II, especially during the 1960s, high modernism began to merge with consumer culture
 In Britain, a young subculture emerged calling itself "modernist", following representative music groups such as The Who and The Kinks

 This merger of higher versions of modernist culture and the consumer resulted in a revolutionary change in the meaning of "modernism"
 sabase pehle, iskaa taatpary tha ki parampara ke tyaag par aadhaarit ek aandolan isaki apni ek parampara ban gai thi
 Second, it showed that the distinction between the classy modernist and the mass consumerist culture had lost its precision
 kuch lekhakon ne ghoshnaa kii ki aadhuniktawaad itnaa sansthagat ho gaya tha ki yah ab "uttar kala-agrani" ho gaya tha jo yah sanket detaa tha ki isane ek krantikari aandolan ke rup main apni shakti ko kho diya tha
 Many have interpreted this change as the beginning of a phase that came to be known as postmodernism
 kala sameekshak robert hughes jaise anya logon ke anusaar, uttaradhuniktawaad aadhuniktawaad ke ek vistaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 "anti-modern" or "anti-modern" movements seek to emphasize realism, composition and spirituality as a deterrence or counter to modernism
 aise aandolan aadhuniktawaad ko nunakaarak rup main dekhte hai or isliye pranaligat evam aakasmik prabhaavon ko dekhne kii aakshamata ke adheen he
 Many modernists adopt this view, as did Paul Hindemith in his final turn toward mysticism, for example
 The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World main paul ech

 iske bajaay, ve tark dete hai, vyaktigat rachanaatmakataa ko rosemara ke jivan ko bhaavnaatmak rup se adhik sweekaarya bananaa chahie
 The effects of modernism in some areas remain more powerful and more determined than others

 Most major capital cities have museums dedicated to 'modern art', different from post-renaissance art
 iske udaahranon main neuyork kaa musium of modern art, landan kaa tet modern or paris kaa centre pompido shaamil hai
 These galleries make no distinction between the modernist and postmodernist phases, seeing both as developmental developments within 'modern art'
 aadhuniktawaad saanskrithik andolanon kii ek vistrut vividhta kaa ek vyapak label he
 Postmodernism is essentially a centralized movement that derived its nomenclature on the basis of socio-political theory, although the term is used in its broadest sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards that demonstrate the awareness of the modern Do and reinterpret it
 uttaradhunik siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki aadhuniktawaad ko "tatheoparant" kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit karne kaa prayaas bemail virodhabhaason se abhishpt he
 In a superimposed sense, whatever was modernist was not necessarily postmodern either

 katha samraat premachand kaa kahana tha ki sahityakar deshbhakti or raajnneeti ke peeche chalane vaali sachai nahin balki uske aage mashaal dikhaati hui chalane vaali sachai he
 This thing has been revealed in his literature

 He also wrote some plays and did some translation work

 Godan is his classic creation
 kafan unki antim kahani maani jaati he
 He wrote with full authority in Hindi and Urdu
 unki adhikansh rachanaaen mul rup se urdu main likhi gai hai lekin unka prakaashan hindi main pehle hua
 In the thirty-three years of creative life, he was entrusted with a legacy of literature which is invaluable in terms of quality and infinite in terms of size
 premachand kii rachana-drushti vibhinn sahitya roopon main pravrutt hui
 a versatile genius, Premchand created literature in many genres such as novels, stories, plays, reviews, articles, editorials, memoirs etc
 pramukhatya unki khyaati kathakaar ke taur par hui or apane jivan kaal main hi ve ‘upanyaas samraat’ kii oopaadhi se sammanit hue

 yah sthiti hindi or urdu bhashaa donon main samaan rup se dikhaayi detii he
 Premchand's novels are milestones not only in Hindi novel literature but also in Indian literature
 premachand katha-sahitya main unke upanyaaskaar kaa armbh pehle hota he
 His first Urdu novel Asrar Maabid aka Devasthan Rajya was published in serial form in Urdu weekly "awaaz-e-khalk" from 8 October 1903 to 1 February 1905
 unka doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 Since Premchand was originally the author of Urdu and came from Urdu into Hindi, all his early novels were originally written in Urdu and later he was written in Hindi
 unhone 'sevasadan' upanyaas se hindi upanyaas kii duniya main pravesh kiya
 He originally wrote it in Urdu under the name 'bajare-hussan' but first published its Hindi form 'sevasadan'
 'sevasadan' ek nari ke veshya banane kii kahani he
 According to Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma, the main problem expressed in 'sevasadan' is the subordination of the Indian woman

 Premchand had started a revolutionary change in Hindi fiction by making Surdas, a blind beggar, a hero of fiction in Rangbhoomi
 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha
 The death of Hori, a storyline trapped in the cycle of feudalism and capitalism, shakes the minds of readers
 kisaan jivan par apane pichley upanyaason 'premashram' or 'karmbhumi' main premanchad yatharth kii prastuti karte-karte upanyaas ke ant tak adarsh kaa daaman tham lete hai
 But Godan's tactful ending is a witness to the fact that Premchand was disillusioned with idealism by then
 yah unki aakhri daur kii kahaniyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Mangalasutra is an unfinished novel of Premchand
 premchand ke upanyaason kaa mul kathy bhartiya gramin jivan tha
 The height that Premchand gave to the Hindi novel remained a challenge for the successors of the latter

 Most of his stories depict lower and middle classes

 premchand ji kii lokapriy kahaniyaan Premchand composed the plays 'sangram', 'karbala' and 'prem ki Vedi'
 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 These plays have become really interactive novels
 premchand ek samvedansheel kathakaar hi nahin, sajag naagarik va sampadak bhi the
 He edited his literary and social concerns through articles or essays in 'hans', 'madhuri', 'jagran' etc
, while editing magazines and magazines in the then other co-existing literary magazines 'chand', 'maryada', 'swadesh' etc

 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society
 1936 main pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan kii adhyakshata karte hue unhone kaha ki lekhak swabhaav se pragatisheel hota he or jo aisa nahin he vah lekhak nahin he
 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye

 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
