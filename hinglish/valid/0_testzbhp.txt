 NASA is developing Gecko Grippers to clear space debris
 pasadena, california main nasa kii jet proplson prayogshaala main shodhakartaaon dwaara antariksh malbe jisamen kakshiya malbe yaa karaab ho chuke upgrahon aadi vastuein sammilit hai ko saafe karne ke liye gekko gripurs ko viksit karne hetu prayaas kiya ja rahaa hai
 Gecko gripper is basically an adhesive material
 is se sambandhit khabar ko 19 disambar 2014 ko jet proplson prayogshaala kii website par prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This gripping system has been developed by Aaron Parnes, a robotics researcher working at JPL and the lead investigator for Grippers
 yah pranali geko se prerit he, jo chhipakaliyon ke ek gana gekkota se sambandhit hai yah ushnkaribandheey pradeshon main saamanyatya paayi jaati hai
 The gecko grippers being developed have synthetic hair similar to the short hair found on the legs of gecko lizards
 in synthetic baalo ko stalks bhi kaha jaataa hai
 They are wedge shaped and on the other hand they are like mushroom caps
 gripping pad halke se kisi vastu ke hisse ko chhu leti he to baalo kaa keval upari bhaag kisi vastu ko chhu paata hai, gripurs kii chipchipahat ko prarambh yaa band kiya ja saktaa hai saath hi inaki disha bhi parivartit kii ja sakati hai
 The temporal viscosity of gecko grippers is achieved through the use of Van der Waals force
 is bal ko nobel puraskaar vijeta bhautik vigyaani yohaness didrick vaan dar vals ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 When the Van der Waals force is applied to the adhesive pad, the synthetic hair is bent
 is tarah se bal or sataha ke bich sampark kaa vaastavik kshetra bad jaataa he, jo adhik se adhik aasanjan ke liye sangat hai
 When the effect of force is eliminated, the hair becomes straight again and the process stops stickiness

 At JPL, more than 30 spacecraft surfaces have been tested to test the accuracy of the grippers
 isse pehle agast 2014 main, ek pareekshan udaan nasa ke antariksh praudyogiki mishan nideshaalay dwaara gekko griper pariyojna ko jaanchane ke liye kii gayi thi
 Researchers aboard the aircraft's C-9B flight during testing used grippers in brief periods of weightlessness
 pareekshan ke dauraan gripurs ek 20 pound ke ghan jo tair rahaa tha ko pakadaney main safal rahaa iske saath hi gripurs antariksh yaan saamagree panelon se bana ek baniyaan pahane ek shodhakarta jo 250 pound vastu ke baraabar tha ko pakadaney main bhi safal rahaa
 These grippers have been successfully tested in the JPL thermal vacuum chamber, with total vacuum conditions and temperatures below 76 ° f that are similar to simulating space conditions
 iskaa 3 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chakra main chaalu or band karke parikshan kiya gaya, iske baad bhi iskaa chipkaane kaa gun achche se kaary karata rahaa
 After that several prototype designs have been prepared
 kakshiya malbe ko saafe karne ke alaava, ye gripurs antariksh yaan ke nirikshan main madad kar saktaa he yaa chote upgrahon ko antarrashtriya antariksh stesan se docking main sahaayta karte hai
 This system can easily capture objects moving in space, otherwise they are difficult to target
 prithvi kii kaksha main 3
9 inch se bhi bade 21000 se adhik tukade kakshiya malbe se tair rahe hai
 The US Space Monitoring Network regularly monitors these objects

 hare patton ke 1,000 bhaag main 2 bhaag chlorophyl-e kaa, 3 / 4 bhaag chlorophyl-bi kaa, bhaag zanthophil kaa or 1 / 6 bhaag caroten kaa rahata he
 Chlorophyll is extracted from the powder of green leaves or dried leaves by 85% alcohol or 80% acetone solvent
 sookhe churna ke lagbhag do kilogram se praaia: 13 gram chlorophyl praapt hota he
 chlorophyll-a is green for some bluishness and chlorophyll-b is green for some yellowing

 The specific rotation of alpha chlorophyll is - 262 degrees and that of beta - 267 degrees
 chlorophyl-e kaa aanvik sutara C55 H72 O5 N4 Mg or chlorophyl-bi kaa C55 H70 O6 N4 Mg he
 Chlorophyll, contains 2
6% magnesium

 Chlorophyll is a waxy substance
 haemoglobin hime or globin kaa aanvik yogic he
 Chlorophyll is actually an ester type compound, in which methyl and phytol alcohols are combined
 chlorophyl ke jalavishleshan se methil or fetol alcohalon ke saath-saath carboxylik amlon ke lavan praapt hote hai, jinhen chlorophylin kehete hai
 Chlorophylline still contains magnesium, due to which its color is green
 yadi chlorophyl kaa jal vishleshan chlorophillage naamak anzime main kiya jaay, to jo utpaada praapt hota he use chlorophylide kehete hai
 Chlorophyllide is a microcrystalline substance, while chlorophyll is acrystically
 amlon ke upachaar se magnesium nikal jaataa he or ab jo utpaada praapt hota he use porafirin kehete hai
 Porphyrin has both acid and alkali properties
 vibhinn avasthaaon main vibhinn abhikarmakon ke upachaar se chlorophyl se anek utpaada praapt hue hai, jinase pataa lagata he ki chlorophyl main pyrol cendrak rahete hai
 Based on the composition of these products, Chlorophyll gave a chemical formula by Fisher in 1939

 Psychosis or schizophrenia is a mental disorder
 isaki visheshtaayen hai- asaamaanya saamaajik vyavhaar tathaa vaastavik ko pahchaan paane main asamarthta
 This disorder is found in about 1% of people
 is rog main rogi ke vichaar, samveg tathaa vyavhaar main asaamanya badlaav aa jate hai jinke kaaran vah kuch samay liye apni jimmedaariyon tathaa apni dekhbhaal karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Both 'psychosis' and 'schizophrenia' literally mean 'breakdown of mind'
 sizophrenia ke kuch pramukh lakshan hai, jaise ki shuruuaat main :- It is not necessary that all these symptoms are seen in every patient, so if any of these symptoms are seen in any person, then he should seek psychiatric advice immediately
 schizophrenia kisi bhi jati, varg, dharm, ling, yaa umr ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Like other diseases, the disease can also be inherited from close family members, so it is more likely to occur in the patient's children, or siblings
 atyadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone dene kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Chemical changes in the brain or sometimes any brain injury can also cause this disease
 neeche die vyavhaarik badlaav rogi ko bigadati avasthaa ke sanket ho sakate hai :- If you feel that a person has these symptoms: - in anaavashyak prabhaavon ke hone par dawa kaa seven roke nahin kyonki yah prabhaav samay ke saath apane aap hi kam ho jate hai tathaa inako rokane ke liye saamaanya si saavdhaaniyaan bhi rakhi ja sakati hai, jaise :- The patient of schizophrenia can lead a perfectly normal life after taking the medication after the main symptoms go away
 vah apni kshamta ke anusaar naukari kar saktaa he, pard saktaa he, dost bana saktaa he tathaa apane sabhi sapane puure kar saktaa he
 a schizophrenia patient can marry after symptom-free, but he has to take care that the new changes in his life do not affect his sleep and medication
 yadi rogi stri hai to vah bina chikitsakeey salaah ke garbh dhaaran na karen
 In children with schizophrenia, the disease can be inherited, but it is not always necessary
 schizophrenia grasit koi vyakti shravan sambandhi vibhram, mithyabhram or asangathit tathaa aswabhaavik soch evam bhashaa pradarshit kar saktaa he; yah vichaar kii shrinkhalaa or vishay pravaah main nuksaan, jisamen vaakya arth kii drushti se keval aspasht rup se sambandhit hote hai, se lekar gambhir maamalon main asambandhata, jise shabd kaa salad kaha jaataa he, tak ho saktaa he
 Social segregation usually arises for various reasons
 saamaajik bodh main kshati sizophrenia se usee prakaar se sambandhit he, jis prakaar mithyabhram or vibhram se pairanoiya ke lakshan or evolision ke nakaaratmak lakshan sambandhit hai
 In an unusual subsystem, may remain stationary in the odd posture, or may display aimless stimuli; These are all symptoms of catatonia
 koi ek lakshan sizophrenia ke nidaan se sambandhit nahin he or sabhi anya chikitsa or maansik sthitiyon main ho sakate hai
 The current classification of psychiatrists assumes that disease symptoms must be present for at least one month over a period of at least six months of disturbed activity
 choti avadhi kii sizophrenia jaisi manovikruti ko chizophrenia rupi vikruti kaha jaataa he
 Late adolescence and early adulthood are the peak times of onset of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia kaa upachaar kiye jane vaale 40% purushon or 23% mahilaon main, yah sthiti 19 varsh kii umr se pehle utpann hui
 These are very important periods in the social and professional development of a young adult and can be severely hampered

 People who develop schizophrenia experience non-specific symptoms of social breakdown, irritability and restlessness in the early period, and transient or auto-limiting psychosis related symptoms in the early stages before the psychosis becomes apparent
 Can
 manochikitsak kurt shenidar ne manorog sambandhi lakshanon ke roopon ko soochibaddh kiya jise unhone mana ki ve schizophrenia ko anya manorog sambandhi vikaron se bhinn karte the
 These are called first-class signs or first-class symptoms of shenider and they include false illusions in the category of being controlled by an external force; The belief that thoughts are being put into one's conscious mind or withdrawn from it; The belief that the views of one person are being transmitted to other people; And listening for confused voices that comment on a person's thoughts or activities or have a conversation with other confused voices
 haalanki unhone vartmaan naidanik mandandon main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, pratham shrenee ke lakshanon kii vishistataa par prashn uthaaye gaye hai
 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia
 unamem mithyaa bhram, shravan sambandhi vibhram or soch sambandhi vikaar shaamil hote hai or unhen vishesh rup se manovikruti kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he
 Negative symptoms are those that are not present in individuals affected by schizophrenia but are typically found in healthy people, that is, symptoms that reflect a loss or loss of general characteristics or abilities
 aam nakaaratmak lakshanon main neeras yaa kunthit karne vaale prabhaav or manobhaav, bhashaa main kripanata, anand kii anubhuti karne kii aakshamata, sambandh sthapit karne kii ichha kaa abhaav or prerana kii kami shaamil hai
 Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life, functional disability, and burden on others than positive symptoms
 kunthit karne vaale prabhaav kii upasthiti ke baavjood, haal ke adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki schizophrenia main aksar ek saamaanya yaa bhavukta kaa ucch str bhi paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se tanaavpurn yaa nakaaratmak ghatnaon ke pratikriyaswaroop aisa hota he
 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior
 anya lakshan vargeekaran kaa pramaan maujuud he
 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication
 manovikruti sambandhi lakshan kai anya maansik bimariyon main maujuud rahete hai, jisamen dwidhruvi vikaar, vyaktitv seemaa rekha vikaar, sickefective vikaar, madhpan, madhpan nashile-padaarth dwaara prerit manovikruti or schizophrenia swarupi vikaar
 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists
 isi kram main ming tsang or uske sahyogi is baat par paricharchaa va bahes karte hai ki manovikruti ke lakshan sabhi main saamaanya ho sakate hai bhale hi iske antim str kii vikruti par vibhinnataayen ho sakati hai, jisamen schizophrenia ko shaamil kiya gaya he, bajaae iske ki schizophrenia kii ateology yaa hetuvigyaan ke vishisht vishaleshan par sachet karte hai ki dsam ke sambandh main bahut kam parichaalanaatmak paribhaasha schizophrenia ke nirmaan par "sahi" uplabdh he
 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes
 schizophrenia main janankshmata kii kamajori ke vidyaman hone kii bahut hi kam shankaa kii jaati he
 The affected person has fewer children than normal people
 is prakaar kii kami 70% purushon or 30% mahilaon main dekhi gai he
 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later
 ek prakaar ke isi jigyaasu nishkarsh se yah pataa chalaa he ki schizophrenia se prabhavit logon main se zyaadaatar log thand yaa basant ke mausam main janmen the 
 ab iske kai udhaaharan maujuud hai ki janmpurv iske sankraman ke prabhaav main aa jane se jivan ke baad ke varshon main bhi schizophrenia kaa vikaas ho jaataa he, basharte isaki alaava udaahranon main utero pathology or is avasthiti ke vikaas ke jokhim ke bich ko kadi ho
 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia
 iske bahut hi kam udhaaharan hai jo yah bataate hai ki sharaab kaa seven sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he, yaa yah ki maansik rup se vyakti kisi vishesh dawa kaa chayan apane swayan ke upachaar ke liye kar letaa he, is sambhaavna kaa sahyog karne vaale kuch hi udhaaharan hai ki dawa kaa prayog pratikul maansik str kaa kaaran jaise maansik tanaav, jigyaasa, pareshaani, ubaaupan or akelepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs , which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation

 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue

 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he
 Its treatment was discovered in the mid-1950s with the development and presentation of chlorpromazine

 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization

 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained
 chunki isamen kaaphi kam pashchaat prabhaav saamne aae the jo ki gatishiltaa ko prabhavit kar sakate the, asaamaanya antipsycotics kai varshon se hi sizophrenia ke liye pratham pankti kaa ilaaj rahaa he, jab tak ki kuch dawaaon ko jo ki isi shrenee main the, unhe food and drug administration dwaara chizophrenia se peedit bacchon or kishoron ke liye hanirahit nahin maan liya gaya
 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency
 sizophrenia se peedit mahilaon main asaamaanya manovikruti rodhi istemaal karne par prolactin ilveshan kaa asar dekha gaya he
 It is not yet known whether new antipsychotics reduce the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndromes, a rare but serious and dangerous neurological problem with the side effects of neuroleptic or psychotropic drugs

 Cognitive behavioral therapy is used for specific symptoms and is used to diagnose other symptoms such as self-esteem, social initiation and insight
 However, the results of prior tests did not reach any conclusion

 Training of social work has produced both positive and negative results
 kuch pareekshanon ne kuch srujanaatmak va khaskar sangeet chikitsa ke bhi sakaaratmak parinaamon ke sanket diye hai
 The Soteria model is also another option in which treatment is done in the hospital itself but with minimal medication use

 saanchaa:grammar series Here English grammar is understood as a set of rules describing the characteristics of the English language
 bhashaa kuch aisi hoti he ki uske tatwon ko kisi khaas dhaanche ke anusaar sanyukt kiya ja sake
 yah lekh roopim-vigyaan, yani bhashaa nirmit karne vaale khand or vaakyavinyas, arthath roopim or shabdon ke prayog se sarthak vaakyansh, vaakyakhand or vaakya nirmaan se sambandhit he
 The grammar of any language can generally be read in two different ways: first descriptive, usually based on a systematic analysis of a large text collection, followed by a description of the structure of the grammar; And the second determinant, which uses the rules of that language as a tool to determine the linguistic behavior of speakers
 Deterministic grammar relates to the obvious controversies of English grammar, often reflecting changes in experiments from time to time
 angrezi bhashaa ke kai aitihaasik, saamaajik or kshetreey swaroop hai
 For example, there are many literal differences between British English and American English; But the grammatical differences are not as clear and will be mentioned as per the requirement
 In addition, many dialects of English conflict with the grammar described here; He is only mentioned briefly
 yah lekh ek saamaanya vartmaan maanak angrezi kii vyakhya karata he, bhashaa kaa vah swaroop jo saarvajanik vaartaon main paaya jaataa he jisamen prasaaran, shiksha, manoranjan, sarkari or samachar reporting shaamil hai
 Standard English includes both formal and informal languages
 sangya vaakyansh or sarvnaam, donon kaa ek sandarbhagat kaary ho saktaa he jahaan ve vaastavik duniya main kisi vyakti yaa vastu ko "ingit" karte hai
 In addition, they share many of the same grammatical functions, in which both can act as doers, deeds, and bills within the syntax
 sangya pad keval ek sangya se mil kar ban sakate hai yaa ve vibhinn tatwon se roopantarit kisi sangya se mil kar jatil ho sakate hai
 Pronouns are words that can serve as a replacement for a noun phrase
 udhaaharan ke liye, nimnlikhit vaakya main The noun term the very large ball with red spots can be replaced by the pronoun it sarvnaam naam ke baavjood, sarvnaam, sangya pad ke bheetar sangya kii jagah nahin le sakate - ve sirf purna sangya pad kaa sthaan lete hai
 It can be represented by the above sentence itself: the noun ball cannot be replaced by the pronoun it, as in the denotative sentence in maamalon main, ek vyakti one shabd kaa prayog sangya ke sthaan par kar saktaa he
 The following sections describe the structure of English nouns, noun phrases and pronouns
 sangya dharnatmak rup se vyakti, vastu, sthaan, athwa vichaar ko paribhaashit karti he
 This hypothetical definition enumerates the central members of the corpus noun
 haalanki, kaalpanik paribhaasha kai sangyaaon kii gananaa main asafal hoti he, udhaaharan ke liye deverbal sangyaaen jaise jump yaa destruction 
 is kaaran se, angrezi ke kai vyakaranik vivaran sangya ko vyakaran kii drushti se paribhaashit karte hai 
 phir bhi, paaramparik angrezi vyakaran or kuch shaikshanik vyakaran, ek kaalpanik paribhaasha se sangya ko paribhaashit karte hai
 Non-proper nouns, in general, are not marked for gender or inflection, but for speech and determinative
 angrezi sangyaaon ke kuch roopaatmak prakaar ho sakate hai: The simple noun is made up of a single metal, which also performs the function of primitives in which inflection can be applied
 udhaaharan ke liye, shabd boy ek saral sangya he jo ek dhaatu se bana he
 The metal boy also serves as the radical boy, which may have a plural suffix attached to -s, adding to it to form the inflected word-form boys
 adhik jatil sangyaaon kaa ek sangya pratipadik ke alaava dhaatuj upsarg yaa pratyay ho saktaa he
 For example, the noun archenemy is composed of a metallic prefix arch and a metallic enemy
 yahaan dhaatuj rup archenemy pratipadik ke rup main kaary kar rahaa he jiskaa prayog vibhakti shabd rup archenemies banane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 An example with a dative suffix is the kingdom which is made up of the suffix king and dom
 angrezi kii kuch sangyaaen kai dhaatuj upsargon or pratyay ke saath jatil ho sakati hai
 a fairly complex example is antidisestablishmentarianism which has metal establishments and suffixes anti-, dis-, -ment, -ary, -an, and -ism
 angrezi sanyukt sangyaaen aisi sangyaaen hai jo ek se adhik pratipadik se bani hoti hai
 Combined paperclip, for example, is made up of episodic paper and episodic clip
 angrezi main samaas ko upyogi tareeke se, prayek pratipadik ke shabdic varg ke aadhaar par vibhinn shreniyon main or arthgat varg ke aadhaar par tatpurush, bahuvrihi, dwandv or karmdharay up prakaaron main pravibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 English nouns usually have a differentiation for the word, forming different forms of singular and plural
 bahuvachan rup aam taur par ekvachan rup se bana hota he jisamen -s yaa -es judata he, lekin kai aniyamit sangyaaen bhi hai
 Ordinarily, the singular form is used when a parable referenced to a noun is discussed, and the plural form is used when another parable is discussed, but there are many exceptions to this rule
 yahaan kuch udhaaharan hai: Words that belong to the noun lexical category can be mainly simple words from the noun category
 isamen man, dog, rice, vagairah, jaise shabd shaamil he
 Other nouns can be derived from words belonging to other lexical categories by the sum of class-changing inflectional suffixes
 udhaaharan ke liye, pratyay -ation, -ee, -ure, -al, -er, -ment, ko kriya aadhaaron main kriya-rahit sangya banane ke liye joda jaataa he
 Still other suffixes form adjective nouns derived from adjectives: in dhaatuj pratyay ko padbandheey dhaatu main bhi joda ja saktaa he jaise stick-it-to-itiveness sangya main, jise + -ive + -ness vaakyansh se praapt kiya gaya he
 In addition to the derivational suffix, words from other lexical categories can be directly converted into nouns by a "conversion" process
 For example, the word run is a verb, but it can be converted into a noun run "points earned in a baseball game", as in the following sentence: yahaan yah spasht he ki run ek sangya he kyonki ise vibhakti bahuvachan pratyay -s se bahuvachan kaa rup diya gaya he, yah apane purv maatraatmak five dwaara sanshodhit he or yah sangya pad five runs ke pramukh ke rup main maujuud he jo purvasargeey pad with five runs main purvasarg with ke poorak ke rup main kaam kar rahaa he
 Other lexical categories can also be changed: iske atirikt, kai vaakyansh aise hai jinako sangya main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he, jaise jack-in-the-box, love-lies-bleeding 
 inhen samaas ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 There are also processes of conversion that change from one noun subclass to another subclass
 vaakyavinyas maandand ke anusaar angrezi main teen mul sangya varg pahachaane ja sakate hai: This syntactic subclass is quite analogous to semantic categories
 Countable and uncountable nouns - jaise dog, rice - pravisheshan ke virodhabhas ko dikhaati hai: a dog, the dog, dogs, the dogs sabhi sambhav hai jaise ki rice, the rice donon sambhav hai
 Countable nouns are different from uncountable nouns in that they can neither be alone nor characterized by some unless they are in plural forms, they can be distinguished from a and become plural
 Can
 shabdaarth rup se aam taur par inkaa taatpary aasaani se pahachaani jane vaali vaiyaktik vastuon se he
 Examples of countable nouns are the following: remark, book, bottle, chair, forest, idea, bun, pig, toy, difficulty, bracelet, mountain, etc
 agananeey sangyaaen, iske vipareet, akele rah sakati hai, some dwaara visheshit ho sakati hai, a dwaara visheshit nahin ho sakati or inkaa bahuvachan nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 shabdaarth rup se agananeey sangyaaen, pruthak naa kiye jane vaale ek samooh ko ankit karti hai
 Examples of uncountable nouns include: rice, furniture, jewelry, scenery, gold, bread, grass, warmth, music, butter, homework, baggage, sugar, coffee, luck, sunshine, water, air, Chinese, soccer, literature, rain, walking, etc
 gananeey or agananeey sangyaaon ke bich roopim-shabdaarthik antar neeche talika main dikhaaya gaya he
 On the other hand, proper nouns, including personal names — such as Peter, Smith, and place names such as Paris, Tokyo — do not show entry contradictions
 Typically, an entry cannot precede them
 Thus, * a Peter, * the Peter, * a Tokyo, * the Tokyo are all indecisive
 Although many proper nouns cannot be preceded by an entry, some proper nouns are invariably applied to an insert
 inamen vyaktivaachak sangya shaamil hai jaise The Hague, The Dalles, the Netherlands, the West Indies, or the Andes 
 haalanki, vyaktivaachak sangyaaon kii tarah hi, bina pravisheshan sanshodhan ke, pravisheshan vaali in vyaktivaachak sangyaaon main bhi pravisheshan virodhabhas kii kami he
 Thus, while The Hague is grammatical, * a Hague and * Hague are ungrammatical
 shabdaarth rup se vyaktivaachak sangyaaon ke anuthe sandarbh hai
 Different subclasses, as seen above, affect grammar numbers and quantitativeness
 upar varnit mul upvargon ke ghatak ko jatil karne vaali jo baat he, vah kuch aisi sangyaaon kii maujuudagi he, jinke ek se adhik upvargon main dwandv ghatak hai or ek sangya kaa uske mul upvarg se duusare upvarg main roopantaran
 Nouns like brick and cake have dual components
 udhaaharan ke liye, brick ke saath nimnlikhit vaakyon ko dekhiye: In the first sentence, brick is an uncountable noun
 brick se pehle kisi pravisheshan ke naa hone se aisa nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki ek agananeey sangya kaa lakshan he 
 duusare vaakya main bricks ek gananeey sangya he kyonki yah bahuvachan he, jo ki sirf gananeey sangya kii ek visheshta he 
anya sangyaaen jinke gananeey or agananeey donon upvargon main dohare ghatak hai, ve hai stone, paper, beauty, difficulty, experience, light, sound, talk, or lamb 
 As mentioned above, many nouns can undergo conversion from one subclass to another subclass
 vyaktivaachak sangya se gananeey sangya, roopantaran kaa ek prakaar he
 a proper name, Picasso can be a countable noun through metaphorical extension, as in this sentence: haalanki Picasso main aksar ek khaas sandarbh hota he, ise lakshanik rup se prayog kiya ja saktaa he jahaan iskaa arth hoga,"picasso dwaara banaai gai ek painting"
 is parivartit sangya ko is tathy ke dwaara ki yah bahuvachan he or iske pehle pravisheshan the laga he, gananeey upvarg ke antargat dekha ja saktaa he
 There are also two idiomatic constructions that are based on conversion from proper noun to countable noun: yahaan Mr
 Smith ke aage pravisheshan a ke kaaran pehle vaakya main yah arth miltaa he ki "ek khaas vyakti shri smith jo ki anyathaa aapse anjaane hai" jabaki duusare vaakya main anutaan balaghat ke saath pravisheshan the ko is andaaz main padhaa jaataa he "the well-known person called Margaret Thatcher"
 The determinant includes insertions, denotative, quantitative, numeric, genitive, interrogative, and exclamation that characterize the noun head in noun terms
 nirdharak aise shabdon kaa kaary karte hai jo anya sangyaaon ko "nirdhaarit" karte hai, jahaan "nirdhaarit" karne ko saamanytah, maatraatmak jaankaree ke sanket ke rup main, vyakaranik vachan, sandarbh se sambandhit mudde or sangya upvarg ghatak se sambandhit samajha jaataa he
 Functions that "determine" are quite different from adjectives that normally provide qualitative information about a noun, but cannot function as determinants
 sangya pad ke bheetar, nirdharak, sangya pad ke baayen kinare kii ore sangya pramukh ke aage or kisi vaikalpik visheshan sanshodhak ke pehle hote hai: Examples are: nirdharak or visheshan kii ek duusare ke saapeksh or sangya mul ke saapeksh sthiti is baat se spasht ho jaati he ki visheshan kabhi nirdharak se pehle nahin aa saktaa
is prakaar, nimnlikhit, avyakaranik angrezi sangya pad hai: *big the red balloon, *big red the balloon 
 Determinants can be divided into three subclasses according to their position relative to each other: purv-nirdharak, kendriya nirdharak ke aage aa sakate hai lekin kendriya nirdharak ke peeche nahin
 uttar-nirdharak, kendriya nirdharak ke baad aate hai lekin aarambh main nahin
kendriya-nirdharak, purv-nirdharak ke baad aane chaiye or uttar-nirdharak se pehle
 is prakaar, ek kendriya-nirdharak udhaaharan the ke rup main a pre-determinant may come first as in all yaa kendriya-nirdharak the ke baad uttar-nirdharak prayog kiya ja saktaa he, jaisaa nimna main many he The pre-determinant + central-determinant + post-determinant can also be harmonized as haalanki, sanyukt karne kii sambhaavnaaon par kai pratibandh hai
 a general restriction is that only one determinant can be in each of the three deterministic positions
 udhaaharan ke liye, uttar-nirdharak many or seven nimnlikhit main ho sakate hai But both many and seven cannot be used in the post-determinative position, as this would make the following cognate decriminalized: * many seven smart children, * seven many smart children, * the many seven smart children, * the seven many smart children 
 Additionally, there are often other literal restrictions
 udhaaharan ke liye, purv-nirdharak all ekal prayukt ho sakate hai yaa ek kendriya-nirdharak se pehle ; baharhaal, purv-nirdharak such akele yaa kendriya-nirdharak a se pehle ho saktaa he such nuisance! such a nuisance! Examples of pre-determinants are all, both, half, double, twice, three times, one-third, one-fifth, three-quarters, such, exclamation what
 Examples of the position of the pre-determinant before the central determinant: kendriya-nirdharak ke udhaaharan hai the, a / an, this, that, these, those, every, each, enough, much, more, most less, no, some, either, neither, which, what 
 Examples of the use of a central, determinant before the adjective modified noun head are: jahaan ek ore the, a / an, no, or every keval nirdharak ke rup main kaary karte hai, vahiin duusari ore anya kendriya-nirdharak bhi anya shabdic shreniyon ke ghatak ke rup main kaary kar sakate hai, vishesh rup se sarvnaam ke rup main
 udhaaharan ke liye, nimna main that ek nirdharak ke rup main kaary kar rahaa he But as a pronoun uparokt nirdharak ke alaava, -'s vaale sambandhkaarak sangyaapad kaa kaary sambandhkaarak nirdharak his, her, its, their kii tarah nirdharak vaala ho saktaa he
 These genitive determinative noun terms are used in place of the central determiner: pravisheshan shabd hai, 'a','an','the'
'a' anishchit he 
 yah anishchit he kyonki yah kisi vishesh ikai kaa ullekh nahin karata, jise vaktaa yaa shrota jaanata ho
"the" nishchit he kyonki yah jis vishesh ikai kaa ullekh karata he, vah shrota dwaara vaktaa ko pratilabhya mana jaataa he
 The entries a / an, and the are words that characterize the noun
 ve kendriya-nirdharak kii sthiti main hote hai
 There are many functions of insertion including certainty notation, specific / general reference, given / new information in speech and noun subclass component
 nishchit pravisheshan "the" kaa prayog aksar kai baar pehle se hi varnit kiye gaye yaa aasaani se pahachaane jane vaali sangya ke vishisht udhaaharan ko sanderbhit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Definite articles differ slightly from signifiers, often indicating the location of the noun in the context of the speaker and audience
 visheshan aam taur par sangya se purv main hote hai, yani the blue car, jahaan blue visheshan he
 However, some adjectives such as lyonnaise come after a noun
 When an adjective is followed by a noun in English, the phrase as a whole is generally taken from the Romance language, typically French
 vyakaranik ling ke avshesh anya purush sarvnaam main sangrakshit he
 Gender is determined on the basis of biological sex, living things and on the basis of social traditions
 "he" is used for pulling nouns; "she" is used for feminine nouns; And "it" is used for nouns with indefinite gender and inanimate objects
 manushyon kaa ullekh karne ke liye it kaa prayog aam taur par avyakaranik or asabhy mana jaataa he, lekin kabhi-kabhi aparaadh yaa apmaan ke rup main jaanboojhkar prayog kiya jaataa he kyonki isse yah arth nikalataa he ki vah vyakti anishchit ling kaa yaa ghatiya manushya he
 Traditionally, Pullinghe was used to refer to another male whose gender was unknown or irrelevant to the context; Recently, this use has been criticized for supporting gender-based norms and is considered inappropriate as a growing experiment
 There is no consensus on the replacement
 angrezi bolne vaale kuch log bojhil "he yaa she" yaa "s / he" kaa prayog pasand karte hai; anya log they kaa prayog pasand karte hai 
 is sthiti main shaayad hi kabhi bhram hota he, kyonki icchit arth, sandarbh se niklaa ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye, "this person has written me a letter, but they have not signed it
"haalanki, yah abhi bhi kuch logon dwaara vyakaran ke hisaab se galat mana jaataa he
 Spivak pronouns have also been proposed that are essentially formed by subtracting the major from the plural counterpart, but they are relatively rare to use compared to other solutions
 tulana ke liye, german bhashi log, samadhvanik shabd sie, sie or Sie ke bich kaa antar bina kisi pareshaani ke pahchaan lete hai
 The classification of a noun is usually expressed by one or more elements called deictic, numerative, epithet, and classifier
 aitihaasik rup se, angrezi kaarak ke liye sangya ko ankit karti thi or is kaarak ankan ke do avshesh hai saravnamik pranali or sambandhkaarak clitic 
 sambandhkaarak, visheshit sangyaapad ke ant main ek clitic dwaara chihnit hota he
 This can be understood in the following way: company se judaa 's clitic company ko visheshit nahin karata balki samooche sangyaapad president of the company ko visheshit karata he
 This can be shown more clearly using brackets: angrezi sarvnaam kaa rup, vachan, purush, kaarak or kaalpanik ling ke anusaar badalata rahata he 
 vachan or purush bhed, maanak aupchaarik bhashaa main madhyam purush main dhah gaye hai, haalanki anaupchaarik boli ke roopon main vachan bhed he 
 Private pronouns are joint forms that are formed by the genitive determinative pronoun followed by -self, with the exception of the other male singular pulling form that is formed from the karm factor him + -self, and the other male plural form that karma factor them + -self + is formed from -s
 bahuvachan main, in nijvachak main niyamit bahuvachan pratyay -s lagata he bahuvachan vibhakti sarvnaam rup ke saath
 Semantically, ourself is used instead of ourselves with any form of we like the royal "we"
 kuch boliyon main anya purush puling or anya purush bahuvachan nijvachak kaa nirmaan sambandhkaarak nirdharak his > hisself or their > theirself se banataa he
 Thus, these dialects have regularized the entire paradigm in genitive form
 angrezi kriyaayein do mukhya prakaar kii hoti hai: The main verbs are verbs such as jump, catch hit and take
 They are literal in nature, contain the main semantics within the verb sphere and are an open class, meaning a verb that usually precedes the main verb in a sentence
 ve simit sankhya main hai, kriya kshetra main vyakaran kii jaankaree dete hai or closed class ke hai
 In sentence kriya is sahaayak he
 In English, three verbs - be, have, and do - can serve as both main verbs and auxiliary verbs Quirk et al
 Has cited these verbs as primary verbs
 nimnlikhit udhaaharan unki dohari kaaryakshmata ko darshaate hai: In addition to the three primary verbs, there are other auxiliary verbs, kriyarthdotik, which include, {{1} can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would
 In addition to their limited ability to act as assistants, models can only come in a finite sentence and cannot be distinguished for time, speech and man
 kriyaarth dyotak varg main adhik seemaant kriya he ought or british kismon main need or dare bhi he
 These appear to have many properties of mood signaling but not all and hence they were termed as marginal mood indicators by Quirk et al
 
 Finally, the verb used Quirk et al
 The marginal model was considered by
 lekin hadalaston or pullum ne isamen or anya model or seemaant model ke bich kai matbhed paae or yah nishkarsh diya ki yah sabase seemaant prakaar kii ek sahaayak kriya he
 Semantically used refers to time or tense, which distinguishes it from models that have modality as their main semantic component
 angrezi kriya ke keval aath sambhav vibhakti rup hai: There are eight inflected forms of adder be as can be seen in the example sentences below: haalanki, adhikansh kriya ke keval chaar vibhinn vibhakti prakaar he: Unlike the additive be, the jump verb has the same coordinate word-form base jump as the base, common non-past and first singular non-past form, and the same coordinate word-form base jump -en, common past and 1st / 3rd sg
 Ghost form Comparing other verbs with the copula shows that only one adder has 1st / 3rd sg
 Ghost form which is different from the normal ghost, a 1st sg
 There is a non-past form that is different from the common non-past form and a base form that is different from the normal non-past form - all other verbs indicate syncretism in these forms
 yojak or ek niyamit jump kii tulana ek duusare se or teen prakaar kii aniyamit kriya se neeche talika main kii ja sakati he
 All verb -ing forms form the -ing suffix in the metal: sabhi niyamit kriyaayein or adhikansh aniyamit kriyaayein, dhaatu main -s pratyay lagaakar, anya purush ekvachan rup banaati hai
 Above, parentheses indicate that this suffix is written as -es or -s
 -es rup ooshm vyanjan ke baad aata he
 -s spelling occurs after all other vowels
 udhaaharan: All regular verbs form the / / en form with the -ed suffix: aniyamit kriyaaon main niyamit kriyaaon kii tarah hi samanvayata ho sakati he athwa paanch alag roopon ke saath alp samanvayata dikhaa sakate hai yaa sirf teen alag roopon ke saath adhik samanvayata 
 bhinn vibhakti roopon kii sankhya ke antar ke saath teen prakaar ke udhaaharan: Irregular verbs with five distinct inflectional forms are not coordinative with the common past and -en forms
 keval teen roopon vaali aniyamit kriyaayein, sabhi roopon main samanvayi hai, sirf -ing rup or anya purush gaiyr-bhoot main nahin hai
 The irregular verbs of five and four inflectional forms produce past and -en in different ways
 kai tareekon main swar apashruti shaamil he or / yaa pratyay sangyojan
 adhik saamaanya tareekon main se kuch kaa, neeche sankshep main ullekh kiya gaya he
 Note that the spelling does not always reflect pronunciation changes in the internal vowel, so the pronunciation is transliterated phonetically: kuch kriyaaon ke saamaanya vartmaan or anya purush ekvachan ke bich aniyamit parivartan hota he: The additive pattern also has suffixes and vowel obsolescence, but is marked by additional complements
 ullekh ke liye ek antim baat yah he ki kuch kriyaayein is rup main doshapurn hai ki ve roopantarit nahin hai yaa roopantaran kii kami ke shikaar hai
 The metal form of the verb beware is beware itself
 yah aam taur par aadeshaatmak vaakyon main paaya jaataa he: The forms bewaring, bewares, bewared are uncommon in modern English
 used kriya aam taur par bhootkaal main prayukt hoti he, jaise ki Or in base form only after do, like used kriya, niyamit kii jane vaali kisi kriya kii dyotak he yaa bhootkaal kii baat karti he or ek anya kriya use jo niyamit kriya he, ke saath bhramit nahin hona chahie
 For many speakers the inflectional paradigm of the stride verb is lacking in past participle
 sahaayak kriyaaon main se be, have, or do kaa, kaal, vachan or purush ke liye roopantaran kiya jaataa he
 The auxiliary verb be has the same eight inflectional forms as a main verb, and have and do likewise have five inflectional forms when they function as the main verb
 iske vipareet, vyakaran ke in maanakon ke aadhaar par, model, gaiyr-roopantarit sahaayak kriyaayein hai 
 However, most auxiliary verbs share the additional conversion of negation
 nakaaratmak vibhakti -n't pratyay se banati he jo sahaayak se judi hoti he
 Thus, the following are the types of modified auxiliary verbs: have ''' Model can't couldn't mayn't mightn't mustn't shan't won't wouldn't seemaant sahaayak kriyaayein daren't needn't oughtn't usedn't Negative forms don't and won't be irregular in their changes in internal vowel and shan't is irregular in its deletion of the final consonant and are almost absent in the standard varieties of American English
 paramparaagat vyakaran -n't ko ek vibhakti pratyay ke rup main nahin balki vyakaranik shabd not ke keval ek dhvanik rup main dekhtaa he 
 is drushtikon ke mutabik, haven't, asankuchit 'have + not, doesn't = does + not, ityadi ke baraabar he
 These narrow negative forms, thus, are short forms of other auxiliary verbs, ie are> 're, is>' s, am> 'm, have>' ve, has> 's, had>' d, does> 's , will> 'll, would>' d
 Has become equivalent to although it is the historical birth of the negative form, clearly in modern language, these words have a -n't suffix that makes a single indivisible word since the negative auxiliary verb, + not different than the constructed configuration Exhibits syntactic behavior
 iske atirikt, yah bhi dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki anya sahaayak kriya ke laghu rup, nakaaratmak sahaayak kriya se samaan vyavhaar nahin karte: Finally, the negative inflection property is generally applied to the auxiliary verb, but not to the main verb
 However, there are two exceptions to the "primary" verb
 mukhya kriya ke rup main be kriya main nakaaratmak vibhakti lagaai ja sakati he jaisaa ki nimnlikhit udhaaharan main dikhaaya gaya he: British varieties may have a negative form of the main verb, whereas for most American varieties it is ungrammatical: tathaapi, anya "primary" kriyaaon kaa, mukhya kriya ke rup main kaary karte hue nakaaratmak rup nahin ho saktaa
 This case of the properties of the auxiliary verb, applied to be and have, is also seen in other syntactic behaviors such as the inverse of the subject and the operator of the auxiliary verb
 is prakaar, ’ve, ’m, ’s, aadi dhvanyatmak rup se pruthak shabdon ke chote kiye gaye rup hai jabaki nakaaratmak -n't ek sankuchit kiya hua pruthak shabd nahin he balki ek pratyay he
 Most English verbs only indicate the word in a non-past tense, indicative mood
 is sandarbh main, anya purush or anya sabhi purushon main virodhabhas he: anya purush -s pratyay ke saath chihnit he jabaki anya sabhi purush achihnit hai 
 iske alaava, vibhakti pratyay -s ekvachan ko darshata he arthath -s anya purush ekvachan karta ko ingit karata he
 Similarly, the singular is represented only in the other male - in the rest of the males the word is unmarked
 anya purush main bahuvachan achihnit he
 The other male singular suffix is added to the common present tense form, while the overprinted form is the common present tense form
 is tarah, saamaanya vartmaan rup or anya purush ekvachan rup ke bich sirf ek bhed he
 Combined with the possessive pronoun subject, there are the following possible pairs of subject-verbs: haalanki, yojak be, gaiyr-bhootkaal main uttam purush ekvachan main atirikt bhed banaata he or bhootkaal main uttam yaa anya purush ekvachan main
anya kriyaaon ke vipareet, be ke ye roopantarit rup ek anupoorak sambandh main rahete hai
 switching is a continuous action
 sarvnaam karta-kriya sangyojan: In the possible mood, all the distinctions of man and word become neutral
 angrezi kriyaayein, pramukh rup se karta ke saath anvay karti hai, jaise nimnlikhit main: However, English allows the verb to be invoked from the noun that is not specifically in the subject's position: kriya kshetra main pratham sahaayak kriya ko oparator kaha jaataa he
 It exhibits various syntactic and morphological features
 The following wikiprojects or Portals may be able to help recruit one: Template: None exists angrezi main kaal parivartan, aakhir main badlaav karke or sahaayak kriya "to be" or "to have" ke prayog se or sahaayak "will" "shall" "would" kaa prayog karke praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 The following examples use the regular verb to listen: vartmaan kaal us kriya kaa varnan karata he jo vartmaan main ho rahi he 
 kriya ko abhi hona chahie, yaa vartmaan kaal dwaara uski vyakhya nahin hogi
 The past tense describes an action that has taken place in the past
 The task may be complete or incomplete
 bhavishya kaal aisi kriya kaa varnan karata he jo bhavishya main hone vaali ho 
kriya abhi tak ekadam naa hui ho, yaa use bhavishya kaal dwaara vyakt nahin kiya gaya he
 The auxiliary verb can be used to define the tense, aspect, or mood of a verb phrase
 jaisaa upar ullekh kiya gaya he, "going to" kaa prayog kuch chhadam bhavishya kaal ke liye hota he: Forms of "do" are used, with some negatives, for questions and to emphasize the common present and common past: ! " ! " kuch logon ko lagata he ki angrezi kriya kaal, nimnlikhit sarini main behatar dekhe ja sakate hai, jo angrezi bhashaa ke samay or uske teen pakshon, arthath purv, purna or apurna
 Note that this table only represents the action actually taking place whether it is present, past or future
 Since unrealistic heuristics are, of course, assumptions, hematological structures with 'would' are not included here
 vyaavhaarik drushti se yah neeche di gai sarini kaa nirmaan karata he: In English, there are two words for verbs: the passive voice and the passive voice
 The root form is the verb and follows the SVO method
 karm vachya, sahaayak kriya "to be" or mukhya kriya ke -en rup kaa prayog karte hue kartri vachya se liya gaya he
 Examples of Karma voice are: Furthermore, the agent and patient switch grammatical roles between kartri and karm vachya so that in karm the patient is the subject, and the agent is noted in an optional prepositional phrase using by, for example: The verb form of the verb is formed by substituting the verb from to be in the same tense and aspect and attaching the -en form of the main verb
 is prakaar: This method continues in all the total times
 kartri se karm ke parivartan kaa shabdaarth prabhaav, kisi kriya kaa avaiyaktikaran he
 It is sometimes used for the direct verbalization of a sentence, or when the agent is either unknown or insignificant, even when included, such as: strenk or white sahit kai lekhan style guide angrezi main karm vachya ke upyog ko nunatam karne kii sifarish karte hai, lekin kai anya nahin karte hai
 There is a third 'voice' in English, related to the classic "medium" voice
 In this, the patient becomes the subject, as in the passive voice, but apparently the verb remains in the passive voice, no agent can be given directly, and in general, an adverb is the subject making the whole construction
 is prakaar: The English verb has "mood"
 inamen hameshaa ghoshnaatmak / sankettmak or sambhavya kriyaarth shaamil hote hai or saamaanya rup se aadeshaatmak ko kriyaarth ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Some people include the subjective or questionable form as an adverbial mood
 sabase adhik prayukt kriya rup udhaaharan hai, jaise: The combination of these moods becomes more complicated when they are used with different tenses
 haalanki, anaupchaarik taur par boli jane vaali angrezi main shaayad hi kabhi sambhavya kaa upyog hota he or aam taur par hetumad kriyaarth, saamaanya vartmaan or saamaanya bhoot tak simit rahata he
 a notable exception to this is the use of the present probabilistic in prescriptive or wishful sentences, which are marked in one or two ways: if the conjunct "-s" is absent and the past tense is not used by the other male singular, declarative mood
 udhaaharan ke liye, "they insisted that he go to chapel every morning" kaa arth he ki uskaa chapel janaa unki maang thi athwa aavashyaktaa thi
 However, "they insisted that he went to chapel every morning" means that he is reiterating the statement that, in the past, he used to attend the chapel every morning
 is tarah ke antar main antarnihit vyakaran ko "america sambhavya" kaha gaya he
 British English does not make such a difference
 On the other hand, other constructions for expressing desire and command that do not use the probabilistic are as common, such as "they required him to go 


" ! Sit! Eat!" angrezi main aadeshaatmak kriyaarth keval madhyam purush main hota he or karta aam taur par spasht rup se nahin kaha jaataa, kyonki yah nihit hota he
 When a speaker gives orders about someone else, he is still directed to the middle man, as if it has been a request for permission, although this may be a rhetorical statement
 kriya ke hetumad roopon kaa prayog if-then bayanon ko vyakt karne ke liye hota he, yaa pratitathytmak prastaav ke jawaab main, bhavishya kii anishchit kriya ko ingit yaa sanket dene ke liye
hetumad ko kaal kaa rup mana ja saktaa he lekin kabhi-kabhi inhen ek kriyamoolak kriyaarth yani hetumad kriyaarth mana jaataa he
 Hetamad is expressed using a combination of the adverbial form of the verb with the adverbial auxiliary could, would, should, may and might
 dhyaan den ki kai vaktaaon ke liye "may" or "might" ek arth main samahit ho gaye hai, jo suchit karata he ki kathan kaa nishkarsh anishchit he
 The implication permission in "may" seems to be limited to only middle men and certain experiments with other men, for example "you may leave the dinner table", or "she may leave the dinner table
" do mukhya sashart tenses angrezi main pahachaanaa ja saktaa he: The main argument given by Huddleston and Pullum for not having a future tense in English is that "will" is a modal verb, both in its grammar and in its meaning
 Biber et al
 isse or aage jate hai or kehete hai ki angrezi main sirf do kaal hai, bhoot or vartmaan: ve "have" vaale purna rup ko "pahalu" ke adheen dekhte hai
 Huddleston and Pullum, on the other hand, regard forms with "have" as "secondary periods"
 visheshan aise shabd hai jo sangya pad main visheshan kii tarah prayog kiye ja sakate hai jahaan ve sangya pramukh ko sanshodhit karte hai or kriya pad main visheshta ke taur par jahaan ve yojak kriya ke poorak hote hai
 For example, the adjective tall noun in the sentence below refers to the noun head man in the tall man
 visheshan nice kriya pad is nice ke bheetar kriya pramukh is ke poorak ke rup main aata he
 The adjective also serves as the head of the adjective term such as the following: yahaan visheshan tall or nice visheshan pad very tall or rather nice ke pramukh hai
 Semantically, adjectives provide more information about them
 visheshan, apane se sambhddha sangya kii pahchaan or varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai
 Another morphological feature of adjectives, which is also shared with adverbs, is their ability to compare comparatively: tall-er, tall-est
 See also the comparison section
 paramparaagat vyakaran se upajane vaala shabd adverb kii vyapaktaa shabdon kii vistrut shrunkhlaa par he jinke vibhinn kaary or vibhinn vaakyatmak vyavhaar he
 Therefore, it is better to divide adverbs into different subclasses and discuss the grammar of each subclass separately
 tulana anubhag bhi dekhen
 Comparative adverbs characterize a point on a hierarchical semantic feature
 neeche kuch tulanaatmak kriyavisheshan hai: Syntactically, comparative adverbs pre-modify adjectives or adverbs: purvasarg aise shabd hai jo ek sangya or kisi or ke bich sambandhon ko darshaate hai
 Usually placed before a noun: eg, on, to, with, by
 angrezi ek karta kriya karm bhashaa he: yah apane saralatam, achihnit ghoshnaatmak kathyon main subject–verb–object kaa anukram pasand karti he
 Thus, "tom eats cheese" and "mary sees the cat" haalanki, in saral udaahranon se pare, shabd kram angrezi main ek jatil maamla he
 In particular, the point of departure of the speaker or writer in each section is an important factor in the formation of the message
 is prakaar, ek sandesh main tatwon ko is tarah se kramit kiya ja saktaa he ki jo pathak yaa shrota ko sandesh ke nihitarth kaa sanket de
 The point of departure can also be determined as an equation, known as thematic similarity
 is tarah se, vastav main kisi bhi tatv ko ek khand main pehle kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, the point of departure is the subject of a declarative clause; This is the unmarked form
 prasthaan kaa bindu jab karta nahin hota to chihnit kiya jaataa he - is prakaar, kabhi-kabhi vah karm hota he or zyaadaatar ek kriyavisheshan vaakyansh 
 In questions, the point of departure is treated slightly differently
 angrezi prashn do prakaar main aate hai: wh-prashn or haa-naa prashn
saadhaaran prashn kaa koi bhi prakaar aise shabd se shuru hota he jo ingit karata he ki vaktaa kya jaananaa chahta he
 Special questions replace the key "what i want to know" with another element
 donon hi ajyaasuchak khand kaa prakaar he "I want you to do something" yaa "I want you and me to do something
" doosraa prakaar aam taur par let us ke saath shuru hota he, pehle prakaar ke achihnit rup main, you garbhit he or spasht nahin kiya gaya he or chihnit rup main shaamil kiya gaya ;ek anya chihnit rup he "do improve your grammar
"nakaaratmak main, "do not argue with me" achihnit he or "do not you argue with me" chihnit he
 In colloquial English, the point of departure is frequently marked by phonetics
 aam taur par, angrezi ek head-initial bhashaa he, arthath vaakyansh kaa ankar, vaakyansh kii shuruyaat main aata he
 The main exception is that common adjectives precede the noun phrase: isse jo vaakya prerit hota he vah he "fred's sister ran quickly to the store
" jaisaa ki is udhaaharan se anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, ek mul vaakya kaa anukram : Adjective1 - Subject - Verb - Adverb - Adjective2 - Indirect Object - Adjective3 - Direct Object
 Interrogative sentences reverse word order
 a grammatical phrase changes from the subject of a sentence, changes the word order, exposes the new subject, and literal or grammatical emphasis also changes it in many cases
 angrezi main kuch OSV shabd kram upyog bhi hai, khaskar jab un sarvnaam ke prayog se tulana kii jaati he jo kaarak ke liye chihnit hote hai
 For example, "I hate oranges, but apples i will eat
" Although very rarely, but sometimes OVS is used, "if it is apples you like, then apples like I," although this last experiment was originally Speakers may feel imaginary and callous
 prashnvachak shabd kram, sawaal poochne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he, kisi jawaab kii ummid athwa bina ummid ke
 adhikansh samay, iskaa gathan ek ghoshnaatmak vaakya main karta or sahaayak kriya ke sthaan ko parivartit kar ke kiya jaataa he, jaisaa ki nimna main: However, when the information sought is the subject of the answer, the word order will not be inverted and the interrogative pronoun takes the place of the subject, as in the following: jab bolaa jaataa he, to is badlaav par jor dene ke liye lay parivartan kaa aksar prayog kiya jaataa he, yaa puri tarah se kuch maamalon main poochtacha pradarshit kar sakate hai 
 prashnvachak vaakyansh kaa nirmaan is tarah se ek ghoshnaatmak vaakya ke vidhey ko sahaayak kriya ke saamne laakar use ek sanketvachak, sambandhvaachak sarvnaam or pariman vaachak ityadi main badla jaataa he
 Ending a sentence with a question mark signifies a questioning phrase
 alankarik sawaal kaa nirmaan sahaayak kriya-karta yugma ko prashn ke ant main rakh kar kiya ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye ""you would not really do that, would you?" There are three types of interrogative sentences in English: Yes / No prashn ko aavashyaktaa hoti he 'yes' yaa 'no' jawaab kii
yadi vahaan ek model kriya, ek sahaayak kriya yaa vaakya main kriya kaa 'to be' rup he to use karta ke saamne rakhen 
 If there is no modal verb, auxiliary verb or verb 'to be' in the sentence then yes / no questions are formed with the help of auxiliary verb 'do'
 sahaayak kriya 'do' kaa koi matlab nahin he
 It takes form according to just the main verb in a sentence
 'do' - vartmaan kaal main: agar vaakya kaa karta uttam purush ekvachan yaa bahuvachan main sangya he, madhyam purush ekvachan yaa bahuvachan or anya purush bahuvachan 
 'does' - in the present tense: if the subject of the sentence, is the noun in the other male
 'did' - bhoot kaal main Note: The main verb in yes / no question comes without any end or in case of past tense - in its first form
 nakaaratmak yes / no sawaal ke gathan ke liye aapako karta ke saamne nakaaratmak model kriya daalani hogi, nakaaratmak sahaayak kriya yaa 'to be' kriya kaa nakaaratmak rup
 If you need to create a negative yes / no question with the help of the auxiliary verb 'do', then you have to use 'don't', doesn't, didn't instead of 'do' does, or did
 sanyukt nakaaratmak or adhik aupchaarik angrezi main prayog kiya jaataa he: Information or Wh-questions require additional information to answer
 To create such a question, you have to insert the question words, all the words in front of the sentence together in the same phrase
 If the question word is part of the subject then you do not need to change the word order
 shabd kram visa hi rahata he jaisaa vaktavy main hai
 If the question word is not part of the subject, then you have to use a modal verb, an auxiliary verb or a 'to be' verb after the question word and in front of the subject
 agar vaakya main koi model kriya, sahaayak kriya yaa 'to be' kriya nahin he to aapako prashn shabd ke baad or karta ke saamne sahaayak kriya 'do' kaa upyog karnaa hoga
 Note: The main verb in the information question comes without end or in the case of past tense - in its first form
 inhen bhi dekhen: # Negation, negative polarity, and assertion
 Disjunctive question tag questions are statements that end with a tag
 tag do yaa teen bhaagon se bana hota he
 First part: a modal verb, an auxiliary verb, or a form of the verb 'to be' in the third part as required for the pronoun
 doosraa bhaag : nipaat 'not' agar bayaan sakaaratmak he
 If the statement is negative, the drop is omitted
 teesraa bhaag : vaktavy kaa karta, ek sangya dwaara vyakt kiya gaya ho
 If there is no modal verb, auxiliary verb or verb 'to be' in the sentence, then you have to use the auxiliary verb 'do' in the tag
 note The main verb 'to have' in bre, behaves as an auxiliary
 yadi vaakya kaa karta tag main anishchit sarvnaam 'somebody' he to ise sarvnaam 'they' dwaara sthanapann kiya jaataa he
 Words like 'nothing', 'never', 'hardly' make the sentence negative, so the tag should be positive
 yadi vaakya 'there' se shuru hota he, is shabd ko ek sarvnaam ke rup main gina jaataa he, to ise tag main tisare bhaag main rakhaa jaataa he
 If the sentence is an imperative, the tag will be 'will you' or 'won't you' / 'will you not'
 yadi vaakya main ‘let us ’, he to tag hoga ‘shall we’
 In more formal English, the tag of positive sentences uses combined negatives: tag kaa arth The tag question requires the person to respond to the statement
 nakaaratmak tag ko ek 'yes' jawaab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Positive tags require a 'no' answer

 Some types of ellipsis are mandatory, while other types of ellipsis are optional
 phir bhi, kinhin vyakaranik parivesh main kuch anya prakaar vaikalpik hai, to kinhin vyakaranik pariveshon main anivaary hai
 For example, underlined words can be optionally omitted in the following sentence: uparokt udaahranon main ek samanvit ghatak ke duusare ghatak main padlope shaamil he
 This type of ellipsis is very common
 anya prakaar ke gaiyr-samanvit vaikalpik padlope nimnlikhit hai: Certain types of ellipsis indicate a very informal or familiar style of language, while others are neutral in this aspect
 padlope kaa prakaar jo sadaa anivaary hota he, niyantran sanrachanaon ko shaamil karata he
 These sentences are usually analyzed with a key phrase, where the phrase's verb takes the finite verb as its complement

 romance ke drishy multah sterling or keli ke bich pradarshit kiye gaye the lekin nirdeshak ne is kaat kar hataa dene kaa faisla kiya
 Director Neil Marshall originally lived near the ruins of Hadrian's Wall, a Roman fort in England that was built to protect against the inhabitants of Scotland
 2003 main is nirdeshak ne yah kalpana kii thi ki ek ghaatak virus ke khatre se wal ko bachaane or iske punarnirmaan ke liye kis tarah kii paristhitiyaan paidaa ho sakati thim
 Marshall also envisioned a mixture of medieval and cutting-edge elements: "I envisioned these high-tech weapons and state-of-the-art soldiers equipped with body armor and helmets - clearly futuristically - on a horseback The medieval confronts the knight
 nirdeshak ne england or scotland ke bich ek diwaar ke punarnirmaan liye kendriya vyavastha ke rup main ek seemaa nirdhaarit karnaa pasand kiya jo bhugolic taur par sanyukt rajya america or canada dwaara nirdhaarit zyada lambi seemaa se kahin adhik vishwasaneey sthaan tha
 In addition, there were many palaces in Scotland that were suitable for the medieval aspect in Marshall's view
 dumsde main dikhaaya gaya ghaatak virus 28 days letters or 28 viks letters jaisi samakaleen filmon se alag ek pramanik plig he jo apane aakraamak vyavhaar se logon ko sankramit karne kii bajaay vastav main vahaan kii aabaadi ko buree tarah nasht kar rahaa he
 Marshall intended the virus to be the backdrop to the film's story in which immune survivors establish a sanitary system for themselves and a better primitive society
 nirdeshak ne janajaatiy samaaj kaa dizin taiyaar karne, tatu or balidaan jaisi adivasee visheshtaon kaa chithran karne ke liye duniya bhar ke janajaatiy itihaason kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Although the survivors are depicted as extremely brutal, Marshall attempted to portray some people in England as isolated through the wall in a "gray image" with the characteristics of selfishly manipulating them
 
 nirdeshak ne dumsde ko 1970 or 1980 ke dashak kii filmon ke liye sarvanaash ke baad kii ek shradhanjali ke rup main rakhane kaa iraadaa kiya tha, jiskaa varnan ve is prakaar karte he, "shuruyaat se hi maine apni film ko is tarah kii filmon ke liye ek shradhanjali kaa rup dene kii koshish kii thi or maine jaan-boojhkar aisa hi kiya
 i wanted to make a film for a new generation of audiences who had not seen these films in the cinema - they probably would not have seen them at all - and wanted to give them the same thrill that i enjoyed watching them
 lekin ise ek tarah se samakaleen rup dene, ection, josh or himmat se bharpoor banane kii koshish kii thi
 "doomsday's cinematic inspirations include: marshall ne dumsde ke nirmaan kii prerana ke rup main metalstorm, zulu, or nirdeshak terry gilium kii filmein jaise ki da fisher king se sandarbh praapt kiya
 Marshall admitted that his creation was "so startling that you will keep on laughing"
 He reflected, "I think it's going to divide the audience

 nirmaan kaa bajet 17 million pound rakhaa gaya tha, jo marshall kii pichhali do filmon dog solgers or da decent ke sanyukt rup se kul bajet kaa teen guna adhik tha
 a large-scale budget was a challenge for a director who was yet accustomed to working with small actors and in limited spaces
 marshall ne is vyapak anubhav kaa varnan is tarah kiya: "vahaan pachaas yaa isse adhik bolne vaale hisse hai; main hajaaron atirikt kalakaaron, sajo-saamaan ke ection drishyon, visphot, car se peechha karne ke drishyon par - kaam kar rahaa hoon

 vijual effect ke dal ne tasveeron kaa sandarbh lene ke liye scotland kaa daura kiya tha jisase ki kep toun, dakshin africa main filmaae gaye drishyon ke sthanon par scottish prishthbhumi daali ja sake
 There were many challenges for the visual effects team, including the depiction of an excessive number of cows with a human population left to their tithes and an understandable form of reconstruction of the Hadrian Wall in different light and from different distances
 dumsde main filmaaya gaya sabase adhik chunauteepurn vijual effect vah close-ap tha jisamen mukhya paatr ko zindaa jalaayaa jaataa he
 The shot required a variety of enhancements and uses in fire related elements to look like a burning rack, burning pig skin, smoke, and authentic

 marshall ne mul rup se 1980 ke dashak ke sinc sangeet ko apni film main shaamil karne kaa iraadaa kiya tha lekin unhone teevr ection ke saath is sangeet kaa sangyojan karne main kathinaayee kaa anubhav kiya

 Alison Rowatt of The Herald considered Doomsday to be "definitely everyday" viewing for an exciting film that left too many unanswered questions in Marshall's script and did not fully develop the characters despite the excellent cast i went
 rowat ne kaha, "apane pichhali filmon main, marshall ne kuch nahin se kuch na kuch baahar nikaal liya tha
 Here it is the opposite
 " aalochak ne shradhanjaliyon kii koshishon or bi-grad kii film ke drushtikon ko sweekaar kiya lekin yah sochaa ki "isamen kuch na kuch or hona chahie tha"
 da nordarn igo ke steve prat ne film ko is prakaar se tola, "ek lekhak ke rup main marshall kathanak main khaali sthaan chhod dete hai jabaki ek nirdeshak ke rup main unhen yah maaloom he ki kis tarah car kaa peechha karne, bagaiyr kanjusee ke gaade khun ke dhabbon par maar-dhaad or ladaai ke drishyon main jahaan sharir ke ang khatarnaak aavriti ke saath katkar girte hai or shariron ko ek khooni lugdi ke rup main kuchalane ke drishyon main adhik se adhik jaan daalaa ja saktaa he
 Phillip Kay of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film as, "doomsday is a poorly thought out science-based fictional story that raises more questions than answers
 " Interpreting msnbc's Duralde Alonso Doomsday says: "it's a funny, derivative, confusingly edited and bloody film, but on the top of it is a kind of grindhouse epic story that Your security is woven and eventually you just follow it
 " duralde kaa maananaa tha ki agar film itani moorkhtapurna nahin thi to mitra ke paatr ko ek "yaadgaar krur bacchee" kii tarah suyogy hona chahie tha
 David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer rated Doomsday a 2
5 out of 4 star, and understood that the film was presented at a better pace than most fictional-action films of large scale while patiently producing their action sequences

 sameekshak james berardinali ne dumsde ke nirmaan main ek gadabadi paayi, jisaki shikaayat karte hue unhone kaha, "ection drishyon ko kahin adhik gambhir banaaya ja saktaa tha agar inhen rapid-fire editing ke jariye ulajhaa nahin diya jaataa or prishthbhumi kii kahani avyavasthit he or zaraa sa bhi dilachasp nahin he
 Berardinelli also admitted that much effort has been made in this film to develop parallel stories, which therefore reduces the chances of gain
 variety ke denis harvey ne kaha ki nil marshall kii "sahaj ection ke prati dilchaspee" ne dumsde ke liye moulikta kii kami ko dur kar diya or yah ki film main shaayad hi koi sust pal maujuud he
 He added, "there is no question that anything done at Doomsday has been done with full enthusiasm, high technical skills and just enough entertainment to avoid being ridiculous
" " harvey ne nishkarsh ko apekshaakrit kamjor mana or abhinay kii gunvattta ko isaki style ke liye santoshjanak paaya jabaki stant sambandhi logon ke kaam ko "utkrisht" ke rup main prashansa ke liye surakshit rakhaa
 san francisco chronical ke peter hartlob ne bhi film ke stant drishyon kii yah kehete hue prashansa kii ki yah "shoshan film yug ke saundarya" kaa ek sansmarneey udhaaharan tha
 "take some of the best stuntmen and a half-hearted cinematographer," Hartlob said of the effect, and you didn't even need a screenwriter
 " Matt Zoller Sitz of The New York Times saw the character of Rona Mitra as an impersonation of Snake Plissken and considered most of the film's supporting characters to be "lifeless"
 Sitz expressed his dissatisfaction at the director's lack of investigative element in the film's acclaim for older films: "doomsday is a frantic, loud, wildly inaccurate and so derivative that it is, in the very context of its predecessors, a child's play attire
" It does not look like trying to highlight their famous images

 Angus macneil, a member of the Scottish National Party, said of the film's impact: "A complementary part is that people are thinking about Scotland as we move towards greater freedom
" lekin film ek aise desh kaa chithran karti he jo abhi bhi landan ke haathon kaa khilonaa he
 It is a decision taken in London that makes it a monitored area
 " Despite being one of Scotland's largest creations in recent memory, Doomsday was neither nominated nor considered as a potential competitor for the BAFTA Scotland Awards; £ 2 million was spent on local services
 nirdeshak nil marshall ne sanghathan ke paas "fresh blad" jodne ke saath-saath sadsyta ke liye aavedan kiya tha lekin jeuri kii charchaa ke dauraan dumsde kaa ullekh hi nahin kiya gaya tha

 IGN called the commentary "somewhat straight behind the scenes and slightly over-congratulatory"
 It saw the film's "most attractive" feature in its visual effects, while other features were thought to be discarded

 He was not even opposed to the rich literature of English, but he respected English as a language of thought and research

 He was in favor of virtuous socialism
 unhone loksabhaa main kaha tha- When the Indian Constitution came into force in 1950, it was also provided that till 1965, English can be used as per convenience, but after that Hindi will be given the status of official language
