 Ludwig Wittgenstein was the philosopher of Austria
 unhone tarkshastra, ganit kaa darshan, man kaa darshan, evam bhashaa ke darshan par mukhyatah kaary kiya
 He is counted among the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century
 unke jite ji ek hi pustak prakashit ho pai - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 Philosophical Investigations became quite popular in later published books
 vitgenshtin cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke professor rahe hai
 Wittgenstein's father Karl was a Jew who later adopted the Protestant religion
 vitganstin kaa sabase bada yogadan bhashaa ko darshanik paripekshya main rakhane kaa he
 When anyone mentions philosophy in linguistics today, Wittgenstein's name is automatically remembered
 vitganstin ke lekhan se kaaphi tark-vitark upja he, yahan tak ki kai baar vitganstin ke kaam ko darshanavipareet bhi kaha gaya he, kintu aisa kahana isaliye galat hoga ki vitganstin se pehle bhi tarkshastriyon ne bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan par jor daalaa tha
 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"

 UMTS kaa sabase aam rup W-CDMA jaise ki anternihit vaayu antarafalak upyog karata he lekin is tantra ke daayre main TD-CDMA or TD-SCDMA bhi shaamil hai
 The scope of UMTS, being a complete networked system, includes radio access networks, core networks, as well as authenticating users through USIM cards
 EDGE or CDMA2000 se bhinn, UMTS ko nae cell toweron or nae aavriti aavanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However, it is quite close to GSM / EDGE as it is based on concepts derived from GSM
 iske alaava, zyaadaatar UMTS handsets GSM ko bhi saport karte hai jisase ki 'dual mod' kaa akhand parichaalan sambhav ho paata he
 Therefore, UMTS is sometimes marketed as 3GSM
 aisa karne kaa uddeshy GSM se iske nikat sambandh ko ubhaarna or pratiyogi takneekon se ise alag karnaa he
 The name UMTS, which was named by ETSI, is commonly used in Europe
 europe ke baahar, is takanic ko duusare naamon, jaise, FOMA yaa W-CDMA ke dwaara bhi janaa jaataa he
 In marketing, it is often referred to as 3G
 UMTS, W-CDMA kaa upyog karte hue, adhiktam 21 Mbit / s ke data transafar daron ko saport karata he, haalanki abhi ke pariniojit networkon main upyogkarta, dowlink conection main, R99 handseton ke liye 384 kbit / s tak tathaa HSDPA hand seton ke liye 7

 Nevertheless, it is more than 9
6 kbit / s of single GSM error-corrected circuit switched data channels, or multiple 9
6 kbit / s channels in HSCSD and is competing with other technologies such as CDMA2000, PHS or WLAN on mobile devices
 Provides access to the World Wide Web and other data services

 GPRS supports far better data rates and is packet switched rather than connection oriented
 yah un kai jagahon par pariniojit he jahaan GSM kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 E-GPRS, or EDGE, is a more developed form of GPRS and is based on modern coding systems
 EDGE ke saath vaastavik packet data 180 kbit / s ke daron ke aasapaas pahunch sakate hai
 EDGE systems are often referred to as "2

 Currently, HSDPA enables downlink transfer rates of up to 21 Mbit / s

 Under the 3GPP Long Term Evolution project, it is planned to provide 4G speeds - 100 Mbit / s down and 50 Mbit / s up - to UMTS using a next-generation air interface based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
 pehla rashtriya upabhokta UMTS network 2002 main shuru kiya gaya jisamen 'telko-pradutt' mobile anuprayogon, jaise mobile tivi or video colling par baari jor diya gaya
 Experiences in Japan and elsewhere have shown that user demand for video calls is not high, and the popularity of telco-provided audio / video elements has declined due to people's greater inclination towards access to the high-speed World Wide Web
 - Whether this access is directly on the handset or in the state of being directly connected to the computer via wi-fi, Bluetooth, Infrared or USB
 UMTS teen alag air interfaces, GSM mobile aplicoshan part kor or spich kodex ke GSM parivaar ko sanyukt karata he

 W-CDMA is currently used in the most popular cellular mobile telephone version

 The W-CDMA system has been widely criticized for its large use of spectrum, delaying the deployment process in countries that have been relatively slow in allocating new frequencies, especially for 3G services
 UMTS maanak dwaara tay frequency bainds hai: mobile-tu-base ke liye 1885-2025 mhz or base-tu-mobile ke liye 2110-2200 mhz
us main 1710-1755 mhz or 2110-2155 mhz prayog kiya jayega kyonki 1900 mhz band pehle se hi prayog main he
 While the UMTS2100 is the most widely deployed UMTS band, UMTS operators in some countries use the 850 mhz and / or 1900 mhz bands, notably AT&T Mobility in the US, Telecom XT in New Zealand, and Nextstra by Telstra in Australia on the Next g network 
 W-CDMA, IMT diarect sprad ke rup main IMT-2000 kaa ek bhaag he
 umts-tdd's air interfaces that use TD-CDMA channel access technology are standardized as UTRA-TDD hcrs that use a 5 mhz increase in spectrum

6 mhz slis par ek anukuli synchronas CDMA ghatak yukt TDMA channel acces vidhi kaa prayog karata he, jisase TDMA se bhi zyada tang frequency bainds main bhi pariniojan sambhav ho jaataa he
 However, the main purpose of the development of this standard, developed by China, was to avoid paying license fees to non-chinese patentees
 Unlike other air interfaces, TD-SCDMA was not initially part of UMTS, but rather in Release 4 of the specification
 were added
 TD-CDMA kii tarah, yah IMT-2000 ke andar IMT CDMA TDD ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 UMTS also specifies a UMTS terrestrial radio access network composed of multiple base stations that possibly use different terrestrial air interface standards and frequency bands
 UMTS or GSM / EDGE ek hi kor network ke ansh hai jisase UTRAN, GERAN kaa ek vaikalpik radio acces network ban gaya he or kawarej or seva sambandhi jaruraton ke anusaar rans ke bich paardarshee swimming sambhav ho gaya he
 Because of this, radio access networks of UMTS and GSM / EDGE are sometimes jointly referred to as UTRAN / GERAN
 UMTS network aksar GSM / EDGE ke saath sammilit rup main hote hai jiskaa baad vaala bhaag bhi IMT-2000 kaa hi ek bhaag he
 The ran's UE interface is primarily composed of RRC, RLC, MAC protocols
 RRC protocol, conection sthapana, maap, radio vaahak sevaaon, suraksha or 'handover' nirnyon kaa niyantran karte hai
 The RLC protocols are mainly divided into three modes - Transparent mode, Unacnowledge mode, Aconolase mode
 AM satv kii kaaryaatmakataa TCP oparation se mail khaati he jabaki UM aaparishan UDP oparation ke sadrishy he
 In TM mode, data is sent to lower layers without adding any headers to the SDU of the higher layers
 MAC ucch parat ke samanuroopit maapdandon ke aadhaar par air interphes par data ko niyantrit karata he
 The set of properties related to data transmission are called radio bearers
 gunon kaa yah set ek TTI main adhiktam anumat data kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 RB includes RLC information and RB mapping
 RB masping RB logical channel transport chanal ke bich pratichitran kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Notation message notation radio bearers and data packets are sent to data rbs
 RRC or NAS sandesh srbs ko bheje jate hai
 Security involves two processes: integrity and initials
 'integrity' verifies the processing of the message and also ensures that no one receives the modified message on the radio interface
 The signature ensures that no one can hear your data on the air interface
 'integrity' and 'abbreviations 'both are used for srbs, while only the initials are used for data rbs
 mobile aplicoshan part ke saath, UMTS GSM / EDGE ke hi kor network maandand kaa upyog karata he
 It also provides a simple migration option for outgoing GSM operators
 haalanki, UMTS ke liye palaayan kaa rasta ab bhi mahangaa he: jabaki adhiktar mukhya buniyadi avasanrachanaayen GSM ke saath saajha kii jaati hai, nae spectrum license praapt karne or maujuuda toweron par UMTS takanic daalane kii laagat bahut adhik he
 CN Internet can be connected to various backbone networks such as ISDN
 UMTS main OSI model kii teen sabase nichali paraten shaamil hai
 The network layer also includes a radio resource management protocol that manages carrier channels between mobile terminals and fixed networks, including handovers
 130 se adhik licenson ko pehle hi duniya bhar ke operataron ko pradaan kiya ja chukaa he 
aisa kar W-CDMA radio acces takanic ko, jo GSM par aadhaarit he, nirdisht kiya gaya
 In Europe the licensing process took place at the end of the 'technology bubble' and the auction process for allocation in some countries resulted in very high prices being paid for the original licenses of 2100 mhz, especially in the UK and Germany
 , Bidders paid a total of € 50
8 billion for the six licenses, two of which were later discounted and abandoned by their buyers
 aisa dekhne main aayaa he ki he ki in baari license shulkon kii prakruti aisi he ki iske kaaran bhavishya main sambhavit laabh-jinke bahut varshon baad aane kii ummid he- par bahut baari kar chukaana padataa he
 In any case, the large price payments have led some European telecom operators to the brink of bankruptcy
 In the last few years, some operators have written off only a part or all of the license cost
 haal hi main, finland main ek vaahak ne saajha vyavastha main 900 mhz UMTS kaa prayog apane aasapaas sthit 2G GSM base steshnon ke saath shuru kar diya he
 It is expected that this trend will spread further in Europe in the next 1-3 years
 europe main aavantit 2100 mhz UMTS spectrum kaa pehle uttari america main prayog kiya ja chukaa he
 The 1900 mhz range is used for 2G services and the 2100 mhz range is used for satellite communications
 tathaapi, prabandhakartaaon ne, 3G main prayukt 2100 mhz range ke kuch hisse ko, saath main aplink main prayukt 1700 mhz range ko mukt kar diya he
 UMTS operators in North America want to implement the European-style 2100 / 1900 mhz system for shared spectrum with 2G services in the current 1900 mhz band
 AT&T wireles ne 2004 ke ant tak 2G PCS sevaaon ke liye aavantit maujuuda 1900 mhz spectrum kaa kathorta se istemaal karte huai sanyukt rajya america main UMTS sevaayen shuru kii
 singular ne 2004 main AT&T wireles ko adhigrihith kar liya or uske baad america ke chuninda shaharon main UMTS shuru kar diya 
 singular ne apana naam badal kar AT&T kar diya or apni maujuuda 1900 mhz ke UMTS network ko or badhaane ke liye kuch shaharon main 850 mhz ke UMTS network kii shuruuaat kar rahaa he or ab apane graahakon ko kai saare UMTS 850 / 1900 phones uplabdh karaata he
 t-mobile's introduction of UMTS in the US will focus on the 2100 / 1700 mhz band, while UMTS coverage in Canada is being provided through the Rogers wireless network on the 850 mhz band
 2008 main australian telko telstra ne tab ke apane maujuuda CDMA network kii jagah 850 mhz main kaary karne vaale ek rashtriya 3G network nextg kaa nextg brands ke rup main armbh kiya
 Telstra currently provides UMTS service on this network and also on the 2100 mhz UMTS network, through co-ownership with a company called 3GIS
 3GIS in networkon kaa swami he or inkaa parichaalan karata he
 The company also shares co-ownership with Hutchison 3G Australia and is the flagship network used by their customers
 optus vartmaan main shaharon or bade nagaron main 2100 mhz band par or kshetreey ilaakon main 900 megahertz band par 3G network kaa sanchaalan chalaa rahaa he
 Vodafone is also going to build a 3G network using the 900 mhz band
 850 mhz or 900 mhz band samakaksh 1700 / 1900 / 2100 mhz network kii tulana main adhik kawarej pradaan karte hai or un kshetreey ilaakon ke liye makul hai jahaan sabskribar or base stesan ke bich duuri adhik hoti he
 Carriers in South America are also now rolling out 850 mhz networks
 UMTS phone or bahut portable hai- ye aise dizin kiye gaye hai taaki anya UMTS network par aasaani se roming kii ja sake 
 uisake alaava, lagbhag sabhi UMTS phone UMTS / GSM dohare mod vaale upkaran hai, arthath yadi koi UMTS phone kol ke dauraan UMTS kawarej kshetra se baahar nikal jaae to kol paardarshee rup se uplabdh GSM kawarej ko hastantarit kar diya jaataa he
 Roaming charges are usually higher than regular charges
 adhikansh UMTS licensadhari sarvyaapee, paardarshee vaishvik roming ko ek mahatvapurn mudda maanate hai
 To enable high-grade interoperability, UMTS phones typically support several different frequencies in addition to their GSM fallback
 alag alag desh alag alag UMTS frequency band ko saport karte hai- europe nen shuru main 2100 mhz kaa istemaal kiya, jabaki america ke adhiktar kariers ne 850 mhz or 1900 mhz kaa prayog kiya
 t-mobile has launched a network in the US that operates at 1700 mhz / 2100 mhz
 in bandon ko america main anya jagahon par bhi apanaaya ja rahaa hai 
 ek UMTS phone or network ko milakar kaam karne ke liye samaan frequency ko saport karnaa zaruri he
 Due to the frequencies used, early models of UMTS phones made for the United States will probably not work elsewhere, and the same applies to phones elsewhere
 duniya bhar main aaj 11 alag-alag frequency 'kambinaton' prayog main hai- iname wo frequency bhi shaamil hai jo pehle purnataya 2G sevaaon ko samarpit thim
 UMTS phones use a universal Subscriber Identity Module USIM and also work with GSM SIM cards
 It is a global standard of identification and enables a network for the identification and authentication of sims in phones
 networkon ke bich roming samjhaute roming ke dauraan customer ko kiye gaye kol ko rediarect karne or upyogkarta ko uplabdh sevaaon kaa nirdhaaran karne kii prakriya ko sambhav banaate hai
 In addition to user subscriber information and authentication information, SIM provides storage space in the phone book
 handset apane data apni smriti par yaa SIM card par store kar sakate hai 
 ek SIM ko dusre UMTS yaa GSM phone main daalaa ja saktaa he or phone SIM ke upyogkarta kii jaankaree ko sweekaar kar letaa he, iskaa arth yah hua ki yah SIM he jo phone ke phone number kaa or phone se kiye gaye colls ke billing kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Japan was the first country to adopt 3G technology and since they did not use GSM earlier, they did not need to build GSM compatibility in their handsets
 unke 3G handset anya jagahon par uplabdh handseton se chote the
 In 2002, NTT docomo's FOMA 3G network was the first commercial UMTS network - using the pre-release specification
 Initially it was incompatible with the UMTS standard of radio level but it used standard USIM cards, ie USIM card based roaming was possible
 Both NTT docomo and softbank Mobile now use standard UMTS
 sabhi pramukh 2G phone nirmaataa ab 3G phone ke nirmaataa ban gaye hai
 Early 3G handsets and modems could only operate at frequencies expected in their country, which meant that they could 'roam' at the same 3G frequencies in other countries
 Like most European countries, Canada and the USA also had almost There are similar frequencies
 lekh UMTS frequency band, duniya bhar ke UMTS network frequensiyon kaa ek avlokan he
 Using a cellular router, PCMCIA or USB card, customers can use 3G broadband services that do not require the choice of a particular computer
 kuch software modem se apane aap hi sthapit ho jate he taaki kuch maamalon main samay-samay par online hone ke liye purna rup se praudyogiki ke kisi gyaan kii aavashyaktaa na ho
3g or bluetooth 2
0 ko samarthan dene vaale ek phone kaa prayog karke, ekaadhik bluetooth-sakasham laptop ko internet main joda ja saktaa he
 Some smartphones may also act as a mobile WLAN access point
 sabhi 3G frequensiyon ko saport karne vaala vaala praayah koi 3G phone yaa modem uplabdh nahin he
 However, many phones have more than one band that still enable extreme travel
 udhaaharan ke liye, aipal ke iphone main paae jane vaale chipset kii tarah hi 850 / 1900 / 2100 mhz par sanchalit hone vaala ek tri-band chipset, bahu deshon main iske prayog kii anumati detaa he jahaan UMTS-FDD kaa upyog hota he
 The main competitors of UMTS are the CDMA2000 developed by 3GPP2
 UMTS se bhinn, CDMA2000, ek maujuuda 2G maanak, cdmaone kaa ek vikasparak unnayan he or ek hi aavriti aavanton ke antargat sanchalit hone main sakasham he
 Its and cdma2000's least bandwidth requirements make it easier to implement in existing spectra
 sabhi maamalon main nahin balki kuch maamalon main, keval maujuuda GSM operataron main UMTS or GSM donon main se kisi ek karyanvit karne ke liye paryaapt spectrum hota he
 For example, in the US D, e and f PCS spectrum blocks, the available amount of spectrum in each direction is 5 mhz
 ek maanak UMTS pranali us spectrum ko paripurna kar sakati he
 Where CDMA2000 is implemented, it is usually present with UMTS
 haalanki kai bazaaron main, sah-maujuudagi kaa yah maamla bahut kam praasangikta kaa vishay he kyonki legislative hurdles spectrum ke ek hi license vaale slis main do maanakon ko sah-karyanvit karne ke liye maujuud hota he
 Another competitor to UMTS is EDGE, an evolutionary upgrade to the 2G GSM system that leverages the existing GSM spectrum
 wireles vaahakon ke liye EDGE kaaryashiltaa ko "bolt-on" karnaa or bhi zyada aasaan, tej or sasta he jise UMTS ko deliver karne ke liye lagbhag sabhi brands or nae upkarnon ko sthapit kiye jane kii apeksha EDGE ko samarthan dene ke liye apane maujuuda GSM transmishan hardware ko apgrade karke kiya jaataa he
 However, UMTS is not the only true competitor developed by 3GPP as EDGE
 iske bajaay, purvavarti UMTS role-out karne vaale ek asthaayee samaadhaan yaa gramin kshetron ke ek poorak ke rup main iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This is facilitated by the fact that the GSM / EDGE and UMTS specifications are jointly developed and depend on a single core network that allows dual-mode operation, including direct transfer
 china ke TD-SCDMA maanak ko bhi praayah ek pratispardhi ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 TD-SCDMA has been added to UMTS 'release 4 as UTRA-TDD 1
28 Mcps low chip rate
 TD-CDMA se bhinn, jo W-CDMA kaa poorak he, yah sookshm or sthool donon cells ke liye upyukt hota he
 However, the lack of vendors' support is preventing it from being a real competitor
 jabaki DECT, ghani aabaadi vaale shahari kshetron main UMTS or duusare cellular network ke saath pratispardhaa ke liye takneekee taur par sakasham he, lekin ise keval gharelu tararahit phone or nijee awasaiya networkon ke liye karyanvit kiya gaya he
 All of these competitors have been accepted by ITU as part of the IMT-2000 family of 3G standards, along with UMTS-FDD
 internet acces said main, pratispardhaa pranaaliyon main wimax or flash-ofdm shaamil hai
 From the GPRS network, the following network elements can be reused: mobile communication radio network ke global sarvice se, nimnlikhit tatwon kaa punahprayog nahin kiya ja saktaa he They can remain in the network and be used in dual-network operations where 2G and 3G networks co-exist while network migration and new 3G terminals become available for use in the network
 UMTS network nae network tatwon ko prastut karte hai jo 3GPP ke nirdeshaanusaar kaary karte hai: The functionality of MSC and SGSN changes when related to UMTS
 GSM pranali main, MSC sabhi circuit switchd opareshnon ko sanbhaalane kaa kaary karata he, jaise, A- or B- sabskribar ko network ke madhyam se jodna
sgsn, sabhi packet switchd opareshnon ko sanbhaalane kaa kaary karata he or sabhi detaa ko network main sthanantarit kar detaa he
 In UMTS, the media gateway takes care of the transfer of all data in both the circuit and packet switched networks
 MSC or SGSN, MGW ke sanchaalan par niyantran rakhata he
 The nodes are renamed as msc-server and gsn-server
 sanyukt rajya america or japan sahit kuch deshon ne ITU siforeeshon se alag-alag spectrum aavantit kiya he taaki UMTS ke liye sabase zyada aam taur par prayukt hone vaale maanak band uplabdh na ho
un deshon main, maujuuda UMTS-2100 upkaran ke antar-sanchaalan ko rokkar or in bazaaron main prayog ke liye alag-alag upkaran ke dizin or nirmaan kii aavashyaktaa hone par vaikalpik band kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 As is the case with GSM900 today, standard UMTS 2100 mhz devices will not work in these markets
 However, it seems like UMTS does not suffer from the compatibility issues of handset bands as much as GSM did because many UMTS handsets were both UMTS and GSM
 The mode consists of multi-bands
 quad band GSM or tri-band UMTS handset or bhi aam hote ja rahe hai
 The early days of UMTS saw early hurdles in many countries
 Highly sensitive to weight and form factor, the market saw the first heavy handsets with low lifetime batteries
 hachisans 3 network kii sabase pehali handset, motorola A830 kaa vajan 200 gram se bhi adhik tha or ise handset ke vajan ko kam karne ke liye usamen ek ditacheble camera bhi tha
 Another important issue involved call reliability that related to delivery problems from UMTS to GSM
 graahakon ne dekha ki unke conection cat ja rahen hai kyonki supurdagee keval ek hi disha main sambhav thi jab phone rakhane ke baad handset waapas UMTS main badal jaataa tha
 This is no longer an issue in most networks of the world
 GSM kii tulana main, UMTS network ko shuru main ek oonche base stesan ke ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa thi
 For fully developed UMTS to facilitate request-based video quality, each base station was required to be installed every 1–1
5 km
 yah maamla us vakt tha jab keval 2100 mhz band kaa prayog kiya ja rahaa tha, haalanki nimna-aavriti bandon ke badhate prayog kii vajah se ab aisa nahin hota he
 Low-band networks have been increasingly used by operators since 2006
 maujuuda praudyogikiyon or nimna-band UMTS ke saath bhi, GSM network kii tulana main telephone or UMTS par data abhi bhi zyada shaktishaalee he
 Apple, Inc
 cited the power consumption of UMTS as the reason why the first generation iphone supported only EDGE
 yphone ke nirgaman se UMTS main baat karne ke samay ko tabhi darshaya jaataa he jab handset ko GSM kaa prayog karne ke liye vyavasthit kar liya jaataa he
 As the battery and network technology improves, the issue is thus becoming less frequent
 UMTS kaa vikaas yojanabaddh nirgamanon ke anusaar hi pragati karata he
 Each issue is designed to introduce new features and improve existing features

 Iqbal Singh Jhundan is a SAD MLA from the Amargarh seat in the Indian state of Punjab
 2012 ke chunaavon main ve apane nikatatam pratidwandvi ko 4426 voton ke antar se haraakar nirvaachit hue
 The Act was originally passed in August 1935 and was called the longest Act of Parliament enacted at that time
 isaki lambaai kii vajah se, pratikriya swaroop bharat sarkaar dwaara adhinium 1935 ko ko do alag-alag adhiniyamon main vibhajit kiya gaya: In literature on Indian political and constitutional history, the reference is generally taken to be a shortened form of the Government of India 1935 Act, rather than being enacted originally as a text of the Act
 adhinium ke sabase mahatvapurn pahalu the: However, the degree of autonomy the introduction of the provincial level was subject to significant limitations: the provincial governor retained significant reserve powers and the British authorities also retained the authority to suspend a responsible government
 adhinium ke kuch hisson kii maang bharat sangh ko sthapit karnaa tha lekin rajasi rajyon ke shaskaon ke virodh ke kaaran kabhi sanchaalan main nahin aayaa
 The remaining part of the Act came into force in 1937 when the first elections were held under the Act
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh ke baad se bhartiya logon ne apane desh kii sarkaar main lagaataar badi bhoomika kii maang kii
 The contribution of Indians to the British war effort during World War i meant that the more conservative elements of the British political establishment felt the need for constitutional change and the resulting 1919 Act of the Government of India
 The act introduced a neo system of government known as the provincial "dyarchy", that is, the government of some regions was placed in the hands of ministers responsible for the provincial legislature while others were appointed by the British-appointed provincial governor
 Were held in the hands of the officials responsible for
 jabaki adhinium, bharatiyon dwaara sarkaar main ek badi bhoomika nibhaane kii maang kaa ek pratibimb tha, saath hi bharat kii vyavastha main us bhoomika kaa kya matlab ho saktaa he iske bare main british bhay kaa ek pratibimb tha
 Experiments with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory
 bhartiya netaaon ke liye ek vishesh rup se niraashaa yah hi ki un kshetron main jahaan keval nammaatr kaa niyantran unhone praapt kiya tha, lekin "mukhya adhikaar" british naukarshahi ke haathon main hi tha
 It was intended to review India's constitutional arrangements and those princely states that were ready to accept it
 haalanki, samjhaute ko rokane ke liye congress or muslim pratinidhiyon ke bich vibhaajan karnaa mukhya kaarak sabit hua chunki vyavastha main sangh ke kaam karne kii mahatvapurn jaankaree thi
 Against the system, the new Conservative-dominated national government in London decided to come forward with the drafting of its own proposal
 lord linlithgo kii adhyakshata main ek sanyukt sansadeey chayan samiti ne kaaphi had tak white paper kii samiksha kii
 On the basis of this white paper, the Government of India bill was created
 cameti str or baad main kattarta ko shant kiya gaya, "suraksha" ko majboot kiya gaya or kendriya vidhansabha ke liye apratyaksh chunaav kaa punah aayojan kiya gaya
 The bill was duly passed into law in August 1935
 is prakriya kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, haalanki bhartiya maangon ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke 1935 kii adhinium ko thodaa or aage janaa chahie tha, iskaa masauda saamagree main bill kaa bistaar or bhartiya bhagidaari kii kami donon kaa arth tha ki bharat main sarvshereshth nirutsaah pratikriya ke saath adhinium kaa hona jabaki britain main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke liye yah kattarpanthi sabit hui
 Although it became unusual for the Acts of the British Parliament to include the Preamble, the lack of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasted with the Act of 1919, which led to the purpose of that Act relating to it for Indian political development
 Established a comprehensive philosophy
 20 agast 1917 ko house of comons ke liye bharat mantri edwin montagu ke vaktavy par aadhaarit 1919 ke adhinium kii prastaavna uddhrut he, jo vaada karti he: 


 is a gradual development of self-governing institution with a philosophy for the progressive presentation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire
 canada or australia jaise maujuuda dominian ke saath bhartiya maangon main ab british bharat main sanvaidhanik samta ko praapt karnaa tha jiskaa arth tha ki british rashtramandal main sampoorn swaittata
 An important element in the British political circle doubted that Indians were able to run their country on this basis and with sufficient "security", perhaps, the Dominion status as an objective after a long period of gradual constitutional development saw
 unke bich yah tanaav or bhartiya or british ke bheetar drushti ke parinamswaroop 1935 adhinium ke besanga samjhaute ko paaya gaya jisamen isaki koi apni prastaavna nahin thi, lekin 1919 adhinium kii prastaavna ko isaki jagah rakhaa gaya phir bhi us adhinium ke avshesh ko nirast kiya
 It was generally seen in India as more mixed messages from the British, suggesting a defiant attitude on its part and the barest of "minimum essentials" towards satisfying Indian desires
 sabase aadhunik samvidhanon ke vipareet, lekin us samay ke rashtramandal sanvaidhanik kanoon ke saath saamaanya, adhinium ne "adhikaar ke bill" ko nae pranali ke bheetar shaamil nahin kiya jisaki sthapana kaa uddeshy tha
 However, in the proposed case of the Union of India there were some complications involving a set of rights, as the new entity included nominal sovereign princely states
 haalanki kuch logon dwaara ek alag drushtikon ko mana gaya or nehru report main masauda ruparekha samvidhan main bill ke adhikaar ko shaamil kiya gaya
 In 1947, a relatively few amendments to the Act made the Interim Implementation Constitution of India and Pakistan
 adhinium keval atyant vistrut hi nahin tha, lekin yah 'suraksha maanak' ke saath ghira tha, british jimmedaariyon or hiton ko banaae rakhane ke liye jab bhi isaki aavashyaktaa hoti hastkshep karne ke liye british sarkaar ko sakasham banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 To meet this goal, the Indian government's institutions are gradually increasing in the face of Indianisation, the decision to use the Act and the actual administration of the security measures in the hands of the British appointed Viceroy and the Provincial Governors who are the Secretary of State for India Was under control
 'vishaal shaktiyon or jimmedaariyon jise governor general apane vivek yaa apane vyaktigat nirnay ke anusaar anushaasan karnaa chahie, yah spasht he ki uske ko superman kii tarah ho jane kii ummid hoti he
 He must be endowed with an infinite capacity for humility, courage and hard work
 "we have inserted many safeguards in this bill" Sir Robert Horn said 


 "but all those safeguards are about the same person i think and she is Viceroy

 if the Viceroy fails, nothing can save your installed system
 " yah bhaashan drudh torij ke drushtakon ko pratibimbit karti he jo ek din lebar government dwaara viceroy kii niyukti hone kii sambhaavna dwaara bhaybheet tha
 a proper reading of the Act shows that the British Government has prepared it for itself, whenever they feel they could take full control of it at any time with the legal tools
 haalanki, bina kisi sateek kaaran ke aisa karnaa bharat ke samooh ke saath unki vishwasaneeyata samaapt ho jaati jinka uddeshy adhinium ko praapt karnaa tha
 Some odd ideas: "sangheey sarkaar main 


 jimmedaar sarkaar kii ek jhalak prastut kiya he
 But there is a lack of reality, as the case lacks the necessary powers in defense and foreign affairs, the Governor General is necessarily given a threshold for ministerial activity and the measure of representation of Indian states is negative and even That there is no possibility of the introduction of democratic control

 Those who are not used to any constitution cannot realize what great powers they have to use

 But here the whole power is not vested in the king? Everything is done in the name of the king, but does the king ever interfere in it? Once power falls into the hands of the legislature, the governor or the governor general never intervene

 The impropriety of this arrangement is evident when the status of British capital in an Indian modern region is given greater prominence and total dominance, the impropriety is maintained through the commercial system, the UK in both India's international and coastal shipping traffic Removal of shipping interests and Indian capital in the UK without value and Indians in shipping within the UK Sector is the non-existence

 " From the moment of the Montagu statement of 1917, it was important to remain in the stage of the reform process if the British were to organize a strategic initiative
 haalanki, british raajnneetik cirkil main samrajyavaadee bhaavana or yatharthwaad kii kami ne ise asambhav bana diya
 Thus the involuntary conditional concessions of power in the Acts of 1919 and 1935 caused more dissatisfaction and failed to win the rule of influential groups in India which were desperately needed
 1919 main 1935 ke adhinium, yaa simon kamishan yojana kaaphi safal hui thi
 There is evidence that Montagu is supported in a similar way but his cabinet colleagues did not consider it

 1939 main congress prantiy mantralayon ke istife ke baad rajyapal yuddh tak purv-congress vaale praanton main sidhe shashan kiya tha
 It was generally accepted that the provincial part of the Act conferred a great deal of powers upon the provincial leaders as long as the British officers and Indian leaders acted under the rules
 However, intervention by the British governor intensified the paternal threat was done

 a few days later Sapru came to Birla to meet the Viceroy

 haalanki linlithgo kaa vyavhaar sanvaidhanik rup se sahi tha saath hi bhartiya vichaaron ke liye yah kaaphi aakraamak tha

 Two-three thousand years BC The discovery of the developed Indus Valley Civilization has brought to light a surprising fact that the oldest art of India was as aesthetic as any other civilization
 jab aajkal kii koi bhi sabhyataa jaagran kii angadaai bhi na le pai thi tab bharat kii yah kala itani viksit thi
 The town planning knowledge of the makers of these settlements was so mature, the materials used by them were of such excellent quality and the composition was so strong that the beginning of that civilization is bound to be considered long ago, about four five thousand years, BC

 Nevertheless, such a grotesque start to the history of end-to-end enriched Indian life with remarkable brilliance and excellent architectural expectation as well as more exploration, linking its link with the Aryan civilization, which is considered more ancient

 Wade Wilson was a former Special Forces operative who currently works on a mercenary killer in New York CT
 ek roj sthaneey baar main kaam karanevaali ascort venesa karlisl se miltaa he jahaan donon ke bich pyaar atarangi ho jaataa he
 a year later, Wade expresses her marriage and she accepts, but suddenly feels a shock
 vaid ko ilaj ke dauraan use cancer ke bare main maaloom hota he or use venesa ke bare main phikr hoti he kyonki vah uske saamne is tarah maranaa nahin chahta
 Vaid then receives an invitation from a confidential program to be admitted, where he could have immense power along with his cancer prevention
 halaaki vaid shuru main inkaar kar detaa he, phir venesa ko chhodane kaa faisla letaa he or is prakriya se guzarane ko raji ho jaataa he
 Then at the laboratory, Wade meets Ajax and Angel Dust, who immediately becomes enraged upon seeing him
 agex ek vishesh serum vaid ke sharir main inject karata he taaki uski madad se kuch supt pade mutant jeens ko jagaa saken, isi tarah dinon din vah kai tarah ke yaatnaaon se gujarata rahaa, buree tarah thakaan va gusse ke bich or usase vah mutansion nikaalte rahe, par kamyaabi nahin milti
 Wade discovers Ajax's real name there, Francis Freeman, which makes him ridiculed
 is nattejey par, agex, vaid kii pattiyaan kholkar use airtite chambar main daal detaa he jahaan kii oxigen kii maatra ko lagaataar badhaane va ghataane se vaid ko asphiziation kii had tak pahunchaa dete hai - abhi hafte bhar bhi use chhutkaaraa nahin mila hota jab tak agex kaa asal makasad vaid ke jarie puraa na hota : ab use ek super gulam banaakar un rais kharidaaron ke haath bechnaa tha
 At the same time, even inside a closed chamber, the WAD can cure cancerous disease with its rapid immunity, but the side effects of the process lead to burn marks all over its body
 vah chambar se bhaag nikalataa he or agex par hamalaa kar detaa he, par use tab ruknaa padataa he jab use kaha jaataa he ki uski badsoorti thik kii ja sakati he
 Ajax then lures Wad into his words, traps him in the back, and leaves him dead in a laboratory fire
 vaid tab bhi us bhayanak aag se jinda batch jaataa he or venesa ke paas vaapis jane kii koshish karata he, lekin apni badashakl ho chuki pahchaan ko thukraae jane ke dar se vah usase dur rahane kaa man bana letaa he
 After consulting his trusted friend Wiesel, Wade decides that he will find Ajax and correct his ugliness with him
 vah apana khufia naqaab taiyaar karata he, saath apni duusari pahchaan ke liye "dedpool" kaa naam rakhata he, or blind el naam kii ek netraheen bujurg aurat ke ghar ke ghar aasraa letaa he
 Chasing these events out of the way, Wade escorts AJEX in a convoy of trains passing through the expressway
 phir uske kai gurgon main maar-kaat machaate hue, vah agex ko sadak kinare le jaataa he or apni badsoorti thik karaane kii dhamkee detaa he
 Soon, he is confronted by x-men members named Colossus and Negassic Teenage Warheads, who are trying to get Wad enrolled in the x-men
 apni ore se dhyanbhanga hone kaa phayda uthaate hue, agex vahaan se bhaag nikalataa he
 Callosus ties the handcuffs to Wade's wrists and tries to drag them, so that x-mansen can return and face him in front of Charles Xavier / Professor X
 lekin vaid apni hi haathon ko kaat daalkar, faraar ho jaataa he
 Where as the night passes, his hands also rise again
 agex bhi tab vizel ke baar pahunchataa he or venesa ke bare main pataa lagaataa he
 Wiesel calls and tells Wade that Vanessa is in danger
 vaid ek badnaam streep club pahunchataa he jahaan wo kaam karti he lekin uskaa saamana karne se vah hichkicha jaataa he
 As a result, AJEX then leads Vanessa
 vah or angel dust se dubaara milane ke liye vaid ko band pade helicarier ke kabadkhane main aane ko kehete hai
 Wade now needs his help from the return colossus and Negassonic, and then the three cab riders arrive at the junkyard
 or phir kalosus or negasaanik ek ore angel dust va uske sipaahiyon se bhid jate he, vaid apane raste main agex ke gurgon se ladate hue aakhirkaar use dhar letaa hai
 But this is where Angelus defeats Callosus at the hands, Negassonic attacks him, but in this accident the device of the Helicarrier hanging on him is destroyed
 jyon hi vah helicarier girtaa, kalosus kudakar negasaanik ko uthaata he or angel dust ko bhi bachaa letaa he, is dauraan vaid bhi venesa ko bachaa letaa he
 While somehow escaping, Ajax then attacks Wade, but gets trapped himself, and at the last he says that there is no cure for Wade's deformity
 kalosus ke etraj ke baavjood, vaid apane haathon se agex ko maar daalata he
 Vanessa also expresses her displeasure at Wade's departure, but she still loves him
 vah vaid ko chumkar use apana lene kii baat jaahir kar detii he
