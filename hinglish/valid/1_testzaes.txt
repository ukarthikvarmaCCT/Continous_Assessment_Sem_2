 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala

 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit

 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'

 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa

 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya

 He brought out the truth of life and time

 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story

 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke

 Although, after manufacturing in factories, the engine of each motor vehicle is properly tested by sitting and running on the right, but it is short-lived
 at: gaadi main lagane ke baad bhi aarambh main kuch samay tak use dhire chalaane se uske sab bering or purje ravaan ho jate hai
 Failure to do so may, at times, cause the engine's cylinders, bearings, and power dispatching equipment to become too hot to cause water and shock to deteriorate, making it impossible to repair
 is samay unamem khub tel bhi diya janaa chahie
 The only disadvantage of giving too much oil to the cylinders is that it burns off the surplus oil and freezes the carbon in the cylinders, which needs to be cleaned only after the first 1,000 km journey
 phir baad main 4,000 kimi kii yatra ke baad saaf karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he

 Many drivers tend to use overpowered brakes instead of congestion, but they should also use side-mounted brakes

 It should be remembered that the left side of the road is guaranteed for vehicles coming from the right side and the right side of the road
 apni hi disha main aage chalanevaale vaahanon kaa abhilanghan karne ke liye unhen apni bain taraf chhodkar unki dahni taraf se nikal janaa chahie
 The driver should stop the motor at the behest of a horse, or the driver of a bullock cart, or a policeman; it is possible that the horse, or the bull, is not under the control of the driver; Or unable to walk
 chauraahon par khadey sipaahiyon ke sanketon kaa tatkshan paalan karnaa chahie
 Also, the drivers should tell the policemen in a gesture that they themselves want to go to the place
 apane aas paas chalanevaale anya driveron ko bhi bataa den ki ve rukna chaahate hai athwa kidar ko mudana chaahate hai
 For the control of traffic at the intersections of modern highways, not even the soldiers are deployed, automatic electrical signals are also installed, so they should be understood and work accordingly
 bhinn kaarkaanon kii bani gadiyon kii rachana main bhinnata rahane ke kaaran unako chaalu karne kii vidhi main bhi kuch bhinnata hoti he
 Many trains, especially in the autumn, cause difficulty while starting, so their control devices should be properly adjusted beforehand
 udhaahrant:, gaadi main svapravartak yantra laga ho athwa na laga ho, prayek gaadi ke uparodhi or jwalak liver ko pehle se hi sahi samanjit kar rakhana chahie
 If the vehicle has a variable flame device, which can cause the spark of electricity to be dropped in advance or delayed, then it should be suspended for some time while starting the vehicle
 yadi chinagaari pehle se chhod di jaaygi, to sampidit gas samay se pehle hi jal uthegi jisase ingine kii gajen-pin aadi par bahut jor padegaa
 On starting, the gear box lever should be kept in neutral position and the arm brake of the arm is tied
 phir petrol ko kholkar jwalak switch laga deni chaahe, jisase ki uskaa bhi paripath puraa ho jaae
 If necessary, the carburettor should be patted lightly, so that petrol is filled in its cell
 ab yadi svapravartak yantra laga ho, to use chaalu kar dena chahie, anyathaa keval haath se ghumaane kaa hi prabandh ho, to pehle uske handls ko puure do chakkar ghumana chahie, jisase ek silinder main te petrol kii gas sampidit hokar bhar jaae, jo jwalan ke liye taiyaari hogi or duusare silinder main chushan kriya hogi
 Then when the handle is down, then it should be turned upwards with a jerk, thus the engine will start running after ignition
 khaali ingine ke kuch minute tak chalane ke bad, jab uske prayek bhaag main garmi aa jaae tabhi usapar gaadi ke preshan yantra kaa bojha daalana chahie
 If there is also a water conductor shutter with radiator, then it should also be closed for a couple of minutes in winter, so that the jacket water gets a bit of heat
 uparyukt kriyaaon dwaara jab ingine bhalee bhanti chalane lage tab klach ke falak ko do chaar second tak dabaakar gaad ke preshan yantra ko nimna gear main lagaana chahie
 At this time, the side brake should remain and the clutch should be attached slowly by placing one leg on the accelerator panel
 phir ingine ke twara pakadte hi brake ko chudaa dena chahie
 Thus the vehicle will start moving at a slow speed
 kai aadhunik gadiyon main uske chaalu hone ke turant baad hi doosraa gear laga diya jaataa he
 To switch from the lower gear to another gear, the clutch panel should be pressed only slightly, but not completely
 is samay twaritra falak ko aaazaad chhod dena chahie, gear liver ko ek kshan ke liye tatasth sthiti main rakhkar use unchi sthiti main sarkaar dena chahie
 After this the clutch should be attached slowly
 phir twaritra falak ko dabaa dena chahie, jisase ingine pehle jitne hi chakkar lagane lage
 All the above procedures should be repeated while allowing the vehicle to run at a higher speed for a higher gear
 isamen antar keval yahi hoga ki gear liver ko tatasth sthiti main kuch adhik kshanon tak rakhana hota he
 The duration of the above neutrality varies for each vehicle while changing the gear to a higher or lower position
 ek baar jab gaadi unche gear par lag di jaae tab uski raftaar main kamibeshi uparodhi dwaara kii jaati he
 The gear of the vehicle should always be changed by pressing the entire clutch
 If you change the gear without pressing the entire clutch, there is a possibility of gear box deteriorating quickly
 jaisaa pehle bataaya gaya he ki yadi driver, apni nigaah maarg par gaadi se lagbhag 100 meter aage tak failaae rakhe, to saamne se aanewaalon se bachane, bhopu bajaane, mode par ghoomane, yaa chadhaai par chadhane ke liye gear badalane athwa chaal ko dhimi karne aadi ke liye kaaphi samay mil jaataa he or gaadi ko donon brake lagaakar jatke se rokane kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 If the vehicle is desired to stay somewhere, first stop the resistor and remove the foot from the accelerator pane, but the clutch should be kept in place
 is prakaar gaadi kii sahaj gati ke kaaran jab ingine shaktirahit hokar khaali chalegaa to vah ek prakaar ke brake kaa kaam karegaa, jisase gaadi swat: hi dhimi padati jaaegi
 Then in the end, the clutch should also be freed and the arm or leg brake should be applied as soon as possible
 gaadi ke thaharte hi gear liver ko tatasth kar dena chahie or haath brake band dena chaahe
 If the car has to be mounted on a shield, the front or rear wheel on the left side should be stuck with a curb stone, thus the car will not roll and the brake will not have to be stressed too much
 gaadi ko tehraane ke sambandh main do baaten yaad rakhni chahie: Drivers often make the mistake of trying to change gear after a long time when the train starts to slow down while climbing
 vaise to aadhunik gadiyon kii kriyaatmakataa main kaaphi lacheelaapan hota he or choti tathaa halaki chadhaaiyaan to ve vaise hi ucch gear par anayas paar kar sakati he, lekin ucch gear par adhik unchi chadhaai chadhane se ingine or shakti preshan yantron par anuchit jor padataa he
 The only way is that as soon as the climb is about to begin, put the dispatching machine on the required low gear, so that the train will accumulate some more power in itself and it will work on the climb
 sadak kii modon par aage kaa rasta nahin dikhaai dene ke karan vahaan khatre kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Therefore, the best way is that the speed of the train should be gradually reduced to 100 or 150 m in advance of any fast turn or normal turn, so that the car can be stopped easily if needed and Do not put too much emphasis on steering while rotating
 yahan par gaadi ko sadak ke madhya se jaraa sa baayein kar liya jaae, kyonki madhya ke nikat se, raste ke kone se aage kaa bhaag kuch adhik duuri tak dekha ja saktaa he
 In this way, when the steering wheel turns slowly, the car automatically turns to the right on the left

 It is not always possible to get a proper idea of what the people around us want to do

 Do not try to get ahead by moving between two vehicles moving forward
 dhime chalanevaale vaahanon kaa abhilanghan keval usee samay karnaa chahie jab saamne se koi doosraa vaahan na aa rahaa ho
 It should never be done while walking on a turn
 kisi khadey hue vaahan kaa langhan karne ke pehle sadaiv bhompu bajaanaa chahie

 The front and back of each vehicle should have a number plate of rectangular shape, whose ground should be black or white and the letters should be written in the prescribed size and white or black
 prayek gaadi par do safed lamp aage kii taraf is prakaar lage hone chahie ki aanevaali gaadi kii chaudaai kaa anumaan dur se hi ho jaae
 a small white lamp should be illuminated on the back illuminating the number plate and there should also be a red light
 pichhlaa lamp suryaast ke aadhe ghante baad avashya jala dena chahie tathaa suryoday ke aadhe ghante pehle tak jalataa rahanaa chahie
 Further Agdeep should be burnt one hour after sunset and extinguished one hour before sunrise
 chaal pratibandh - aabaadi kii nikatavarti sadakon par motor gaadiyaan 30 kimi prati ghanta se adhik tej nahin chalaani chahie
 There is often a rule in areas of the population not to run faster than 15 km per hour
 is prakaar kii suchnaayen sadakon ke sahare lage soochnapaton par likh di jaati hai
 Speed control and other types of warnings and other types of information are often put in place, which means that the train should always be driven at such a speed that there is no accident
 durghatana hone par, chaahe koi motor chaalak kisi durghaatna se pratyakshtaya sambandhit ho, yaa na ho, use ekadam thahar janaa chahie
 If the policemen interrogate him, he should also give his name and address by answering him truthfully
 swayan se durghatana kaa purna vivaran likhakar tathaa do gavaahon ke bayaan bhi likhakar, unke naam or pate sahit hastakshar bhi le lene chahie
 In case of collision of trains, after measuring that location, the correct position of your car and the position of other related vehicles should also be written
 durghatana main yadi koi vyakti ghayal ho gaya ho, to us sthal par maujuud sabhi drywaron kaa kartavya he ki ve us ghayal kii praathmik chikitsa kar nearesth aspataal main pahunchaa den, tathaa police ko bhi aavashyak soochna de den
 If the car is insured, then all the above information should also be sent to the insurance company
 gaadi tehraana- yatriyon kii suvidha ke liye rajmarg or galiyon main bhi gaadi kuch der tehrai ja sakati he, yadi vahaan tehraane se yatayaat ko baadha na pahunche
 At such a time, the engine of the vehicle should be closed and the brakes applied
 lekin yaad rahe ki aam raaston par gaadiyaan adhik der tak nahin roki ja saktin
 In the big cities, stops are made at special places
 yahan chaahe jitani bhi der gaadi roak ja sakati he
 Where such a place is near, the car should be stopped there itself

 However, the population of some countries like Nigeria and China is not even known to be close to a million, so there is a lot of error in such estimates

 Population control is generally considered to reduce population growth by reducing birth rate

 This includes the colonization movement, in which Greek outposts were built around the Mediterranean and Black Sea in order to provide sufficient space for the greater population of individual states to settle
 kuch unani nagar rajyon main jansankhya kam karne ke liye shishu hatya or garbhpaat ko protsaahan diya gaya
 An important example of compulsory population control is the People's Republic of China's one-child policy in which having more than one child is considered very bad

 The birth of only 100 girls as compared to 114 boys in the country's sex ratio shows that infanticide is usually done according to gender choice

 On the other hand, those individuals who can control themselves in terms of reproduction, such people can further accelerate the process of childbirth or make it successful

 However, fertility control from moderate to high levels does not necessarily involve reducing fertility rates
 yahaan tak ki jab aise alag alag samaaj kii tulana ho jo prajnan niyantran ko acchhee khaasi tarah apana chuke he, to baraabar prajnan niyantran yogyata rakhane vaale samaaj bhi kaaphi alag alag prajnan str de sakate hai, jo ki is baat se judaa hota he ki chote yaa bade parivaar ke liye yaa bacchon kii sankhya ke liye vyaktigat or saanskrithik pasand kya he
 Unlike fertility control, which is primarily an individual-level decision, the government may make several attempts to control the population, such as by increasing people's access to contraceptive devices, or by other population policies and programs
 As defined above, "fertility control" is not involved in implementing 'population control' at the government or social level, as a state can control the population of a society even though the use of reproductive control in society is very less You go jansankhya niyantran ke ek pahalu ke rup main aabaadi badhaane vaali nitiyon ko angeekrut karnaa bhi zaruri he or zaruri he ki ye samajha jaae kii sarkaar jansankhya niyantran ke rup main sirf jansakhya vruddhi ko rokna nahin chaahati| jansankhya vruddhi ko protsaahit karne ke liye sarkaar na keval apravas kaa samarthan kar sakati he balki janm samarthak nitiyon jaise ki kar laabh, vittiya puraskaar, chhuttiyon ke dauraan vetan dena jari rakhane or bacchon ki dekh rekh main madad karne dwaara bhi logon ko atirikt bachche paidaa karne ke liye protsaahit kar sakati he

 paristhitiki main, kai baar jansankhya niyantran puri tarah sirf parbhakshan, beemaari, paraseete or paryaavaran sambandhi karkon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In a continuous environment, population control is controlled only by the availability of food, water and security
 ek nishchit kshetra adhiktam kul kitni prajatiyon yaa kul kitne jivit sadasyon ko sahaara de saktaa he use us jagah kii dhaaran kshamta kehete hai
 Sometimes it also involves human impact on plants and animals
