 The word Agam is used for the basic texts of Jainism
 keval gyaan, manapryav gyani, avadhi gyani, chaturdashpurv ke dharak tathaa dashapurv ke dharak muniyon ko aagam kaha jaataa he
 Somewhere the holder of the new east has also been considered as a forward
 upachaar se inke vachanon ko bhi aagam kaha gaya he
 As long as Agam Bihari Muni existed, it was not so important, because till then the conduct of the conduct of the Munis was directed by the Agam Munis
 jab aagam muni nahin rahe, tab unke dwaara rachit aagam hi sadhana ke aadhaar maane gaye or unamem nirdisht nirdesan ke anusaar hi jain muni apni sadhana karte hai
 The term Agam is used for literature in Jain philosophy
 shrut, sutara, sutan, granth, siddhant, deshna, pragyapana, upadesh, aapt vachan, jin vachan, aitihya, amnaay aadi sabhi aagam ke paryaayavachi shabd he
 The word "aa" is derived from the prefix and gum metal
 'aa' upsarg kaa arth samantaat arthath purna or gam dhaatu kaa arth gati praapt he arthath jisase vastu tatva kaa purna gyaan ho vah aagam he athwa ye bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki aapt purush jineshwar rup main jo gyaan kaa upadesh dete he un shabdon ko ganadhar jinaki lipi baddh rup main rachana karte he un sutron ko aagam kehete he
 Agama literature is also divided into two parts: Angapravisht and Angabahm
 angon kii sankhya 12 he
 He is also called Ganipitaka or Dwadashangi: inamen drushtiwad kaa purnat: viched ho chukaa he
 a lot of the remaining eleven organs have also been amputated
 iske atirikt jitne aagam hai ve sab angabahm hai; kyonki angapravisht keval ganadhrakrut aagam hi maane jate hai
 Apart from the ganadas, Shrut Kevali, Purvadhar etc
 are considered as Agama Angabahm composed by knowledgeable men
 aagmon kii manyata ke vishay main bhinn bhinn paramparaayen hai
 Digambar Amnay has non-existent literature, he believes that the Agam has disappeared
 shwetambar amnaay main ek parampara 84 aagam maanati he, ek parampara uparyukt 45 aagmon ko aagam ke rup main sweekaar karti he tathaa ek parampara mahanishith oshaniryukti, pindaniryukti tathaa 10 prakeern sutron ko chhodkar shesh 32 ko sweekaar karti he
 The basic reason for this is that according to the Shvetambara tradition Acharya Devardhiginixama Shramana scripted 84 Agamas, but over time many Agamas were automatically destroyed, some were destroyed during the reign of Mughal rulers and many Agamas were so influential that they remembered The deities used to come, so to avoid the misuse of such learning, the saintly monks stored it
 bhagwaan mahavir se lekar aryarakshit tak aagmon kaa vargeekaran nahin hua tha
 Pravachak Arya Raksha categorized the Agams into four parts on the basis of subject for the convenience of the disciples
 isamen aachaar vishyak sara vivechan diya gaya he
 The noun phase of the conductor proceeds is used
 jain darshan kii manyata he ki nanss saaro ayaaro gyaan kaa saar aachaar he
 The cultivation of knowledge should be for the worship of ethics

 The epistemology of the eternal substance of the people and the classification of the proceeds that discuss philosophical facts have been called fluid

 This includes Chandraprajnapati, Suryaprajnapati etc
 drushtaant upama katha sahitya or kaalpanik tathaa ghatit ghatnaon ke varnan tathaa jivan-charitra-pradhan aagmon ke vargeekaran ko dharmakthanuyog kii sangya di gai he
 In addition to the rendering of these ethos and elemental ideas, along with this, the relevant subjects of the then society, economy, state, education system etc
 have been relevant in a very authentic way
 bhartiya jivan ke aadhyatmik, saamaajik tathaa tathvik paksh kaa akalan karne ke liye jainagamon kaa adhyayan aavashyak hi nahin, kintu drushti denevaala he

 over-da-counter yaa band vinimay vyapaar kaa arth he sidhe do partiyon ke bich vittiya sadhano jaise stock, band, vastuon, yaa derevative kaa vyapaar karnaa
 This is in contrast to exchange trade, in which facilities are created for the purpose of trade, such as future exchange or exchange of stock
 america main, stock main over-da-counter vyapaar bazaar nirmaataaon dwaara kiya jaataa he, jo dealron ke bich kotesan sevaaon jaise pink kot pink otisi bazaar dwaara sanchalit) or otisi bulatin board kaa upyog karte hue pink shits surakshaon or oticibibi main bazaar banaate hai
 OTC stocks are neither generally listed nor traded on any stock exchange, although stocks listed on the exchange may be sold by the OTC in the third market
 haalanki oticibibi par uddhrut stock america suraksha or vinimay ayog ke vinimanon ke anusaar hone chahie, anya otisi stock, jaise ve stock jinhen pink shits surakshaon kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he, ko reporting kii zarurat nahin hoti he, jabaki ve stock jinhen otisicueks kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he, ve pink otisi bazaar ke madhyam se vaikalpik prakatikaran dishanirdeshon ke anuroop hai

 Environmental psychology is a multidisciplinary field focused on the study of the interrelations of human and its environment
 yahan par paryaavaran shabd kii vrihad paribhaasha main prakritik paryaavaran, saamaajik paryaavaran, nirmit paryaavaran, shaikshik paryaavaran tathaa soochna-paryaavaran sab samahit hai
 Over the years, extensive research work has been done on various aspects of the environment and this subject is gradually becoming a prosperity study area, many subjects have been contributed in this study
 iske adhyayan kshetra ke antargat vaataavaran ke prakaar, unke, prati manushya kii abhivritti, samskruti ke prabhaav, paryaavaran kii sanrachana or abhikalp ityadi kaa vistruti vishleshan kiya ja rahaa he
 There is a distinction of psychological studies concerned with "environment", otherwise the psychological variables will continue to address only the internal mental processes and thus will always remain indirect or untouchable
 aantarik prakriyaaon par se rahasy kaa aavaran hataane ke liye or vaastavik jagat ke saath sarthak samvaad sthapit karne ke liye paryaavaran ko uddipak ke rup main sandarbh ke rup main yaa pratyakshikaran ke rup main, apane adhyayan main shaamil karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Initially environmental psychology was mostly taken as a study focused on the physical environment and later its social and cultural aspects were also added
 paryaavaran manovigyaan main is samay teen pramukh saiddhanthik upaagam prachlit hai- The approach of adaptation takes the environment as its physical characteristics and considers the person a biological and psychological animal
 iskaa uddeshy paryaavaran main vidyaman khataron ko taalna hota he
 The approach of opportunity structure emphasizes the purpose of environment and the characteristics associated with the period of the country, the opportunities and facilities received in it
 paryaavaran kii samasyaayen saamaajik sanrachana dwaara utpann maani jaati he or swayan paryaavaran saamaajik-saanskrithik rup se paribhaashit ek vyavastha he
 The approach of interchangeability analyzes and establishes the person in the environment and believes that the person and the environment continue to influence each other
 smaraneey he ki in upagamo ke saath kuch vishesh prakaar ke mulya tathaa abhigrah bhi jude hue hai or shodh kii samasyaon or vidhiyon kaa chayan unheen par nirbhar karata he
 Today's contemporary environmental problems are present at both a local and global level
 paryaavaran manovigyaan apane adhyayan ke prayaas main paryaavaran kii samasyaon ko sulajhane or jivan kii gunvattta main vruddhi laane ke liye patibaddh he
 It is not only insufficient to draw conclusions about real-life circumstances for its proper development
 paryaavaran or vyaavhaar kaa sambandh praayah sidhaa na hokar anya parivartyon dwaara prabhavit hota rahata he
 This has been a topic of interest for psychologists
 aadhunik paryaavaran-manovigyaan kaa ek bada bhaag paryaavaran kii un bhautik visheshtaon ke adhyayan se judaa he jo manushya ke saamaanya vyavhaaron ko baadhit karti he
 The effect of crowd, noise, high temperature, water and air pollution etc
 on human nature and behavioral behavior has been studied
 bhartiya parivesh main jansankhya ke dabaav tathaa urja kii samasya ko dhyaan main rakhkar kai prashn upasthiti hote hai
 Indian psychologists have specifically studied the feeling of congestion and its psychological consequences
 gaanv se shahar main palaayan ke kaaran shaharon main bheed badhati ja rahi he or iske falswaroop na keval bhautik paryaavaran balki manushya ke swasthya, saamaajik kaary-kalap or kaarykushalta aadi bhi nakaaratmak dhang se prabhavit ho rahi he
 Crowd is associated with population density but it also has a psychological aspect in the form of congestion
 jisko dhyaan main rakhe bina bheed ke prabhaavon kaa samuchit vishleshan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Numerous laboratory and real life studies have shown that congestion has a negative effect on performance, social interaction, mental and physical health, etc
 manushya kii aavashyaktaaon kaa swaroop tathaa pratidwandvita-sahishnutaa kii pravriti bheed ke prabhaav ko parisimit karte hai
 It is worth remembering that the density of population gives a sense of the number of people living in a certain place and the feeling of lack of crowded space
 bheed ki anubhuti ghar baahar praathmik tathaa dwitiyak paryaavaran main alag-alag paayi jaati he
 Crowd studies have taken place in both laboratory and real-life situations
 prayogshaala main kiye gaye adhyayanon main samanyikaran kii sambhaavna apekshaakrit simit rahati he
 Also, the feeling of congestion is not same in different places
 adhyayanon ke parinaamon se yah spasht hota he ki anubhuti na keval paristhiti vishisht hoti he balki bachi ja sakanevaali dashaon main bheed aprihaary dashaon kii tulana main adhik hoti he
 The performance of complex tasks decreases due to congestion and noise, but the negative effect of congestion decreases when a person is adapted to these restrictions
 ghar ke andar ke paryaavaran kaa pratyakshikaran shahari or gramin kshetron main alag-alag paaya gaya he
 Normalizing the results of crowdsourced studies is virtually a challenge because real-life situations vary
 ek hi vyakti apni dainik jeevancharya main bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii or bhinn-bhinn anischitata kii maatra vaali bheed kii sthitiyon se gujarata he
 Probably, based on the experience of these situations, the person develops a favorable level and reacts on the same basis
 bheed kaa maanav vyavhaar par naakaaratmak parinaam kyon padataa he ? ise samajhane ke liye kai siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Principles of behavior limits, control and movement are prominent among them
 inamen bheed ke prabhaavon kii vyakhya ke liye alag-alag madhyavarti parivartyon kii sankalpana kii gayi he unki adhyayanon dwaara aanshik pushti hui he
 The relationship between crowd and health depends on the amount of social support available
 bheed or tapakram ke prabhaav bhi sangyanatmak karkon kii madhyavarti bhoomika ko spasht karte hai
 The density of population in households has been found to have a negative effect on health, dealing with children, cognitive support, etc
, but this effect decreases when controlling socioeconomic and demographic factors
 smaraneey he ki koi bhi parivarty sthaayee rup se madhyavarti char nahin ho saktaa kyonki prayek antah kriya gatyaatmak hoti he
 Meaningful consideration of environment and its problems is possible only in the context of cultural factors
 visheshrup se ucch jansankhya vruddhi, simit sansaadhan, garibi, samaaj kii gramin evam krishi pradhan prishthbhumi saamaajik parivartan ke liye vikaas yojana va vibhinn saanskrithik paramparaayen hamaare liye vichaarneey hai
 In Indian society giving priority to inter-personal relationships, family and community, where the family is not the individual but the basic unit of the society, the environmental restrictions will not have the same effect as western countries
 bhartiya paristhiti in arth main bhi bhinn he yahan par aane vaale pratibal vividh prakaar ke hai
 They are connected to each other and cannot be easily controlled
 aadhunik bhartiya adhyayan sampratyaatmak rup se adhikanshtah paashchaat vichaardhaara se hi prabhavit rahen hai or bhartiya saamaajik yatharth ke prati kam samvedansheel rahe hai
 In fact, the feeling of crowds varies in the Indian environment where people's lives have been steeped in various rites, customs, rituals, relationships and relationships
 abhi bhi ekanki parivaar kii sankhya main vruddhi hone ke baavjood sanyukt parivaar kisi-na-kisi rup se bana hua he
 a different approach is expected in this situation
 bahut saare avasaron par bheed kii upasthiti vaanchhneeya maani jaati he or vyakti ko isamen gaurav kii anubhuti hoti hai
 Also, establishing and sustaining relationships has been considered a social responsibility
 aisi sthiti main bheed kii anubhuti kaa hona yaa na hona maatr logon kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti par hi nahin varan is par nirbhar karti he ki bheed main koun se log upasthiti hai
 When there are acquaintances or loved ones, the person among them feels the expansion of their own self
 bheed ko praayah simit sthaan main logon kii upasthiti main utpann sthanbhav ke bodh yaa anubhuti ke rup main liya jaataa he
 This needs to be reconsidered as it is insufficient for congestion
 bheed main koun se log hai or unke ekatra hone kaa udeshy kya he ? bina is dhyaan die bheed kaa samprathyayan adhuraa hoga

 Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writing was little known in ancient times
 alegsenderiya se ganitagyon ne unhen padhaa or uddhrut kiya, lekin pehla vyaakhyaatmak sankalan si

 Archimedes probably studied in his youth in Alexandria, Egypt, where he was a contemporary of Conan of Samos and Eratosthenes of Cyrene
 unhen unke mitra kii tarah samos ke conan se sandarbhit kiya jaataa tha, jabaki unke do kaaryo ) kaa parichay iratosthenej ke sambodhan se diya jaataa tha
 Archimedes died c 212 BC The Second Punic War took place when Roman armies led by General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year siege
 plutark ke dwaara die gaye lokapriy vivaran ke anusaar, archimedes ek ganitiya chitra par vichaar kar rahe the, jab shahar par kabza kiya gaya
 a Roman soldier ordered him to come and meet General Marcellus, but he refused, saying that he had to complete work on his problem
 isse sainik naaraaz ho gaya or usne apni talwaar se archimedes ko maar daalaa
 Plutarch also gives an account of the death of Archimedes, less-known, stating that he was probably killed when he was attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier
 is kahani ke anusaar, archimedes ganitiya upkaran le ja rahe the or unhen isliye maar diya gaya kyonki sainik ne sochaa ki ye keemtee saamaan he
 General Marcellus is said to have been greatly enraged by Archimedes' death, as he considered him an invaluable scientific asset and ordered that Archimedes should not be harmed in any way
 mana jaataa he ki archimedes ke antim shabd the, "mere vruton ko pareshaan mat karo ", yahaan vruton kaa sandarbh us ganitiya chitra ke vruton se he jise archimedes us samay adhyayan kar rahe the jab roman sainik ne unhen pareshaan kiya
 These words are often described in Latin as "noli turbare circulos meos", but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they are not found in the description given by Plutarch
 archimedes ke makbare par unka pasandida ganitiya pramaan chitrit kiya hua he, jisamen samaan unchai or vyas kaa ek gola or ek belan he
 Archimedes certified that the volume and surface area of the sphere is two-thirds of the cylinder

 The account of the siege of Syracuse given by Polybius was written in his Universal History about 70 years after the death of Archimedes and was later used as a source by Plutarch and Livy
 yah ek vyakti ke rup main archimedes par thodaa prakaash daalata he or un yuddh mashiinon par dhyaan kendrit karata he, jinhen mana jaataa he ki unhone shahar kii raksha karne ke liye banaaya tha
 The most widely known fact about Archimedes is how he discovered a method for determining the volume of an object of an irregular shape
 vitruvius ke anusaar, raja hero II ke liye ek lorel vreth ke aakaar kaa ek nayaa mukut banaaya gaya tha or archimedes se yah pataa lagane ke liye kaha gaya ki yah mukut shuddh sone se bana he yaa beyimaan sunar ne isamen chaandi milaayi he
 Archimedes had to solve this problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it into a regular-sized object to calculate its density
 nahaate samay, unhone dekha ki jab ve tub ke andar gaye, tub main pani kaa str upar uth gaya or unhone mahasoos kiya ki is prabhaav kaa upyog mukut ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Water cannot be compressed for practical purposes, so the submerged crown will replace its volume with equal amounts of water
 mukut ke bhaar ko pratisthapit pani ke aaytan se vibhajit karke, mukut kaa ghanatv praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If cheap and low density metals are added to it, then its density will be less than gold
 phir kya tha, archimedes apni is khoj se itane zyada uttejit ho gaye ki ve kapadey pahananaa hi bhul gaye or nagn avasthaa main galiyon main bhaagate hue chillane lage "ureka !" The story of the gold crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes
 iske alaava, pani ke visthaapan ke maapan main aavashyak sateekta kii atyadhik maatra ke kaaran, iske dwaara varnit vidhi kii vyavhaarikta par sawaal uthaaye gaye hai
 Perhaps Archimedes gave a solution that applied to a theory called Archimedes' theory in hydrology, which he describes in one of his texts on floating bodies
 is siddhant ke anusaar ek taral main dubi hui vastu par ek utplavan bal lagata he jo iske dwaara hathaaye gaye taral ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the gold crown with solid gold, for which the crown would have been first balanced on a scale with a sample of gold, then the mechanism would have been immersed in water
 
 yadi mukut sone se kam ghanaa tha, isane apane adhik aaytan ke kaaran adhik pani ko pratisthapit kiya hoga or is prakaar is par lagane vaale utplavan bal kii maatra namoonay se adhik rahi hogi
 This difference in buoyancy may have been seen on the scale

 Athenaeus of the Greek writer Naukratis described how King Heron II asked Archimedes to design a huge ship, the Siracusia, to be used for luxury voyages, to supply goods, and as a naval warship
 Could

 par uskaa betaa prahlada jo ki vishnu bhakt tha, ne hirankshyap kii ichha ke viruddh ishwar kii puja jari rakhi
 Hiranyakashipu had to torture Prahlada, sometimes made him fall from the high mountains, sometimes left him alone in a forest full of wild animals, but Prahlada's divine faith did not suffer and every time he escaped safely by the grace of God

 Similar debates have also taken place in neighboring countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Russia

 According to the law, up to 4 wives will be allowed
 bahuvivaah ko vaid banane ke samarthak ye tark dete hai ki "isse desh ki janasankhyikeey stithi ko sudhaarney main sahaayta milegi"

 unhone kaha ki bahuvivaah ko vaid karne ke sthaan par bina vivaah hue, paidaa hone vaale bacchon ko or adhikaar dene vaale kanoon ki aavashyaktaa he
 Some similar views were expressed by a woman in Almaty that, "many women have become second or third wives, but neither they nor their children have any rights", in newly passed laws
 i do not want to see the word polygamy, but i want men to have responsibilities and they should be held responsible for all their relations and children elsewhere through official marriage

 battisvin putali rani rupavati ne raja bhoj ko singhaasana par baithne kii koi ruchi nahin dikhaate dekha to use achraj hua
 He wanted to know why Raja Bhoj does not have the previous anxiety
 raja bhoj ne kaha ki raja vikramaditya ke devataaon vaale gunon kii kathaayen sunakar unhen aisa laga ki itani visheshtaayen ek manushya main asambhav hai or maanate hai ki unamem bahut sari kamiyaan he
 Therefore, they have thought that they will make the throne again in the same place from where it was removed
 raja bhoj kaa itnaa bolnaa tha ki sari putaliyaan apni rani ke paas aa gayi
 He cheered and thanked King Bhoja for his decision
 putliyon ne unhen bataaya ki aaj se ve bhi mukt ho gayi
 From today onwards, this throne will not have any statue on it
 unhone raja bhoj ko vikramaditya ke gunon kaa aanshik swami hona batalaaya tathaa kaha ki isi yogyata ke chalate unhen is singhaasana ke darshan ho paye
 He also told that from today onwards the aura of this throne will be reduced and like all the things of the earth, it will also have to go through the process of getting old and destroyed
 itnaa kahkar un putliyon ne raja se vidaa lee or akaash kii ore ud gayi
 In the blink of an eye, all the effigies dissolved in the sky
 putliyon ke jane ke baad raja bhoj ne karmchaariyon ko bulawaaya tathaa gaddha khudwane kaa nirdesh diya
 When the pitcher was dug up after calling the laborers, he read the Ved Mantras and pressed the throne in the pit in the presence of the whole people
 mitti daalkar phir vaisaa hi tila nirmit karavaaya gaya jis par baithkar charvaaha apane faisle detaa tha
 But the new mound could not show the miracle that was in the old mound
 upsanhaar- kuch bhinnataaon ke saath har lokapriy sanskaran main upsanhaar ke rup main ek katha or milti he
 What happened after it was rebranded with the throne - it is described
 aadhikarik sanskrit sanskaran main yah upsanhaar rupi katha nahin bhi mil sakati he, magar jan saadhaaran main kaaphi prachlit he
 Many years passed
 vah tila itnaa prasiddh ho chukaa tha ki sudur jagahon se log use dekhne aate the
 Everyone knew that the throne with supernatural qualities had been buried under this mound
 ek din choron ke ek giroh ne faisla kiya ki us singhaasana ko nikaalkar uske tukade-tukade kar bech dena chaahate the
 He dug a pit miles before the mound and after many months of hard work, he dug a tunnel and reached that throne
 singhaasana ko surang se baahar laakar ek nirjan sthaan par unhone hathaudon ke prahaar se use todna chaha
 Such a terrible spark came out that the breaker would burn
 singhaasana main itane saare bahumoolya ratna-maaniky jade hue the ki chor unhen singhaasana se alag karne kaa moh nahin tyaag rahe the
 The throne was made entirely of gold, so the thieves thought that even after selling all the gold, many thousands of gold currencies would be found and they would accumulate so much money that there would be no need for anyone to do anything in their family
 
 ve sara din prayaas karte rahe magar unke praharon se singhaasana ko ratti bhar bhi kshati nahin pahaunchi
 On the contrary, his hands scorched with sparks and his eyes started hurting after seeing the sparks again and again
 ve thakkar baith gaye or sochate-sochate is nattejey par pahunche ki singhaasana bhutaha he
 Being a ghost, King Bhoja did not keep it for his use
 mahal main ise rakhkar zaroor hi unhen kuch pareshaani hui hogi, tabhi unhone aise moolyawaan singhaasana ko dubaara zamin main dabava diya
 They were thinking of abandoning its temptation just like Raja Bhoj
 tabhi unka mukhiya bolaa ki singhaasana ko todaa nahin ja saktaa, par use isi avasthaa main uthaakar duusari jagah le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The thieves draped the throne neatly and decided to take him in the same form to another kingdom not far from that place
 ve singhaasana ko lekar kuch maheenon kii yatra ke baad dakshin ke ek rajya main pahunche
 Nobody knew anything about that throne there
 unhone johariyon kaa vesh dharkar us rajya ke raja se milane kii taiyaari kii
 He showed the king the golden throne studded with gems and said that he was going to live far away and he had prepared this throne by putting all his money
 raja ne us singhaasana kii shuddhta kii jaanch apane rajya ke bade-bade sunaaron or johariyon se karwaai
 Everyone praised the beauty and purity of that throne and advised the king to buy that throne
 raja ne choron ko uskaa munhamaanga mulya diya or singhaasana apane baithne ke liye le liya
 When that throne was installed in the court, the whole court shone with supernatural light
 usamen jade hiron or maanikyon se badi manamohak abha nikal raheen thi
 The king's heart was also pleased to see such a throne
 shubh muhu dekhakar raja ne singhaasana kii puja vidwaan panditon se karwaai or us singhaasana par nity baithne laga
 The discussion of the throne started spreading far and wide
 bahut dur-dur se raja us singhaasana ko dekhne ke liye aane lage
 Everyone would have called the fate of that upcoming king blessed, because he had the opportunity to sit on such a wonderful throne
 dhire-dhire yah prasiddhi raja bhoj ke rajya tak bhi pahaunchi
 Hearing the description of the throne, he felt that Vikramaditya should not have a throne
 unhone tatkaal apane karmchaariyon ko bulaakar vichaar-vimarsh kiya or mazdoor bulawaakar tile ko phir se khudhvaya
 His suspicions on the carve-out came true and after seeing the tunnel he came to know that the thieves stole the throne
 ab unhen yah aashcharya hua ki vah raja vikramaditya ke singhaasana par arudh kaise ho gaya
 Is that king really possessing the equivalent qualities of Vikramaditya? unhone kuch karmchaariyon ko lekar us rajya jaakar sab kuch dekhne kaa faisla kiya
 After reaching there after a long journey, he reached his court to meet the king
 us raja ne unka puraa satkar kiya tathaa unke aane kaa prayojan poocha
 Raja Bhoja told the king everything about that throne
 us raja ko bada aashcharya hua
 He said that he never had any problem in sitting on the throne
 raja bhoj ne jyotishiyon or panditon se vimarsh kiya to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki ho saktaa he ki singhaasana ab apana sara chamatkaar kho chukaa ho
 He said that the throne may no longer be of gold and gems and rubies are just pieces of glass
 us raja ne jab aisa suna to kaha ki yah asambhav he
 He had the thieves conduct a thorough investigation before buying it
 lekin jab johariyon ne phir se uski jaanch kii to unhen ghor aashcharya hua
 The throne had lost its luster and had become absolutely brass
 ratna-maaniky kii jagah kaanch ke rangeen tukade the
 The king sitting on the throne was also very surprised
 usne apane jyotishiyon or panditon se salaah kii tathaa unhen gananaa karne ko kaha
 He said after much study that this miraculous throne is now dead
 ise apavitra kar diya gaya or iskaa prabhaav jaataa rahaa
 He said- "now this dead throne should be cremated with the rule of law
 ise jal main pravaahit kar diya janaa chahie
 " us raja ne tatkaal apane karmchaariyon ko bulaayaa tathaa mazdoor bulavaa kar mantrocchar ke bich us singhaasana ko kaveri nadi main pravaahit kar diya
 Time kept on passing by
 vah singhaasana itihaas ke pannon main simatakar rah gaya
 It was discussed in folk tales and public stories 
 anek raajaaon ne vikramaditya kaa singhaasana praapt karne ke liye kaalaantar main ek se badhkar ek ghota khoro ko tainaat kiya or kaveri nadi ko chaan maaraa gaya
 But no one has got a glimpse of it till date
 logon kaa vishwaas he ki aaj bhi vikramaditya kii si khoobiyon vaala agar koi shaasha ho to vah singhaasana apni sari visheshtaon or chamak ke saath baahar aa jayega

 twarak bhautikee, bhautikee kii vah shakha he jisamen kan twarakon kii ke dizin or unke parichaalan se sambandhit sabhi bhautik pahaluon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Software has an important role in the design and operation of particle accelerators
 bahut se kaamon main kan twarak main keval ek kan kii gati kaa adhyayan kar paanaa bhi bahut suchnaayen pradaan karata he
 Following are some codes of this type- upar ekal aavesh kii gatiki vaale softwaron kii charchaa kii gayi he
 But the reality is that a group or group of particles move in the accelerator, not a single particle
 jab kan samooh main hote hai to unka aapas main antalakriya hoti he jiske kaaran kan-punj kaa aakaar bad saktaa he or gucchh kii lambaai bad sakati he yaa antavpunj scatering hoti he
 Additionally, space charge can cause instability in the beam and can also result in beam degradation
 spes charge ke prabhaav ko bhi sammilit karne ke liye praayah pvaason sameekaran ko trekking ke dauraan kuch-kuch duuri par hal kiya jaataa he jiske liye partical-in-cell takanic kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 It is worth remembering that when the energy of the particle is high, the effect on the size and instability of the beam is reduced due to space-charge

 Therefore, calculating this impedance for the accelerator is an important task
 is kaary ke liye pramukh code ye hai- There are many types of magnets used in particle accelerators
 in chumbakon, radio aavriti cavity aadi kii dizin karne or inhen samajhane ke liye bhi anekon software prayukt hote hai
 Some of the codes used for these- Given the variety of modelling tasks, there is not one common data format that has developed
for describing the layout of an accelerator and the corresponding elements, one uses a so-called "lattice file"
there have been numerous attempts at unifying the lattice file formats used in different codes
 One unification attempt is the Accelerator Markup Language, and the Universal Accelerator Parser
 Another attempt at a unified approach to accelerator codes is the UAL or Universal Accelerator Library
 The file formats used inmad may be the most common, with translation routines available to convert to an input form needed for a different code
 Associated with the Elegant code is a data format called SDDS, with an associated suite of tools
 If one uses a Matlab-based code, such as Accelerator Toolbox, one has available all the tools within Matlab
 can twarakon kaa anek kaaryon ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 For example, particle physics and the production of synchrotron radiation
 When performing a modeling task for any accelerator operation, the results of charged particle beam dynamics simulations must feed into the associated application
 Thus, for a full simulation, one must include the codes in associated applications
 For particle physics, the simulation may be continued in a detector with a code such as Geant4
 For a synchrotron radiation facility, for example, the electron beam produces an x-ray beam that then travels down a beamline before reaching the experiment
 Thus, the electron beam modeling software must interface with the x-ray optics modeling software such as SRW, Shadow, mcxtrace, or Spectra
 Bmad can model both X-rays and charged particle beams
 The x-rays are used in an experiment which may be modeled and analyzed with various software, such as the DAWN science platform
 OCELOT also includes both synchrotron radiation calculation and x-ray propagation models

 Origin of the term biodiversity prasiddh sangrakshan jeevigyaani thomas ujin lavajoy ne 1980 main 'biological' or 'diaversity' shabdon ko milakar 'biological diaversity' yaa jaivik vividhta shabd prastut kiya tha
 Since the term felt slightly larger in terms of daily use, in 1985, W
G
 Rosen invented the term 'biodiversity' or biodiversity
 mul shabd ke is laghu sanskaran ne turant hi vaishvik sweekaaryata praapt kar lee
 Hardly a day goes by when we do not come in contact with this word
 samachar patron or shodh patron main uddhrut yah shabd aasaani se samaksh aa jaataa he
 It is surprising to not have a single ideal definition for the term biodiversity meant so much
 parantu shabd ke arth se hi iske myne samaj main aa jate hai
 Everyone knows that 'biological' means an organism and 'diversity' literally means type
 There is no dilemma in deriving the meaning of 'bio', the first part of biodiversity, the term indicates life or life
 jaivik vividhta athwa jaev vividhta kaa sidhaa arth he, "jivit sansar kii vividhtaayen"| Biodiversity is the variation and inequality of all organisms and ecosystems
 hamaara jivan prakruti kii anupam dein he
 Green plants, different types of fauna, soil, air, water, plateau, rivers, sea, ocean etc
 are all the gift of nature, which is necessary for our survival and development

 It was also decided on the occasion of enforcing consensus among various countries on the decisions taken at the Biodiversity Convention held in Nairobi on 26 May 1992, that every year, to ensure people's participation towards biodiversity, and to maintain biodiversity
 In order to maintain everyone's participation and harmony, an international day will be celebrated worldwide

 We can teach others not by preaching, but only by presenting our example

 Therefore, try to be the way you want to see the environment around us first

 The things that we get from God, from the world, only receive the same amount as fuel for the fire of life

 However, according to the poet's mention, the inspiration to create this epic got him from Adikavi Valmiki

 Accounting is considered a requirement for the successful operation of modern business operations
 lekhankan kyon aavashyak he, ise nimna tarkon se spasht kiya ja saktaa he - There are several accounting systems, among which the following are notable: 1
 nakad len-dein 2
 single accounting system 3
 doharaa lekha pranali 4
 Indian bookkeeping system is pranali kaa prayog adhiktar gaiyr vyapaarik sansthaaon jaise club, anathalay, pustkaalay tathaa anya samaaj sevi sansthaaon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of these institutions is not to make profit and it only wants to know from the bookkeeping how much cash they have and how much is left and how much is left, only cash book is made under the cash system
 is pustak main saare nakad lendenon ko likhaa jaataa he
 At the end of the year no final account or profit and loss account etc
 is created
 aay-vyay kii sthiti ko samajhane ke liye ek aay-vyay khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 In this method, cash transactions are written in cash book and credit transactions are written in ledger
 yah pranali mukhyatah chote footkar vyapaariyon dwaara prayog kii jaati he
 In this way, keeping books only gives information about the condition of the cash of the merchant, that is, how much cash came and how much is left and how much is left
 kisko kitna dena he tathaa kisase kitna lenaa he, isaki jaankaree khaataa bahi se ho jaati he
 With this method it is not possible to create profit-loss account and economic letter unless this system is converted into a double accounting system
 isliye is pranali ko apurna pranali mana jaataa he
 It is considered the best system of bookkeeping
 is paddati main prayek vyavhaar ke donon roopon kaa lekha kiya jaataa he

 The main objective of financial accounting is to identify, measure, write, transmit financial information as well as record business transactions in the books of accounts in such a way that the operational results of the business for a fixed period can be known and on a fixed date
 Economic status has to be ascertained
 laagat lekhankan laagton ke lekhe karne kii ek aisi prakriya he jo aay va vyay, athwa un aadhaaron ke jin par unka pariklan kiya jaataa he, ke abhilekhan se armbh hoti he tathaa sankhyikeey samankon ke taiyaar hone ke saath hi samaapt ho jaati he
 This accounting method also considers current costs as well as future expenses
 prabandh lekhankan se taatpary lekhankan evam sankhyikeey pravidhiyon kii soochna ko prastut karne evam nirvachan karne ke vishisht uddeshy ke liye prayog se he
 It is designed to bring maximum efficiency to the information managers and to assist in the task of measuring their performance after considering, projecting and coordinating future plans
 agar hamen kisi upkram kii sthirataa, vikaas or laabhadaayakta sunishchit kerani ho to uski maanav sampatti se adhik mahatvapurn anya koi sampatti nahin he
 Its importance can be easily understood when other means of production such as capital, materials, torches, etc
 are all available and workers are not available
 itnaa hote hue bhi is mahatvapurn sampatti kaa lekhankan evam moolyankan aarthik chitthey main kisi bhi prakaar parilakshith nahin hota he
 As a result, the comparison of the economic results of the two firms on the basis of mere capital on appropriation etc
 is incomplete and sometimes misleading
 lekhankan main is kami ko dur karne ke liye maanav sansaadhan moolyankan evam lekhon main darj kar vittiya parinaamon main pradarshit karne kii ek nayi pranali viksit hui he jise maanav sansaadhan lekhankan ke naam se janaa jaataa he

 Final accounts are also prepared by revaluation
 vartmaan main is lekhankan kii do vidhiyaan-vartmaan laagat lekhankan tathaa vartmaan kray shakti lekhankan prachlan main he
 In the present few decades, the ideology of social responsibility has emerged in business

 Under social accounting, a business can show the extent to which it has carried out social responsibilities by creating a social profit-loss account and social letter
 lekhankan kaa mul uddeshy sanstha main hit rakhane vaale aantarik tathaa bahya pakshakaron ko aavashyak suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 But what information a party needs, it depends on the nature of interest in his business
 vibhinn pakshakaron kii drushti se aavashyak lekhankan soochna kaa vivechan is prakaar he- Owners arrange funds for the running of the business, hence they want to know that they have appropriated the funds provided by them
 us kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti jaanane ke liye lekhankan suchanaaen chaahate hai
 Such information is provided from time to time by financial statements prepared from accounting records
 duusare se kaary karwaane kii kala hi prabandh he
 Therefore, the management should ensure that its subordinate employees are doing proper work or not
 is sambandh main lekhankan suchanaaen bahut sahaayak hoti hai kyonki isse prabandhak karmchaariyon ke nishpaadan kaa moolyankan kar saktaa he
 Corrective action can be taken by comparing actual performance of employees with pre-determined standards, if actual performance is not of the desired level
 vastav main lekhankan suchanaaen hi prabandh kii vittiya niti, niyojan evam niyantran kaa aadhaar hoti hai
 Appropriators include potential shareholders and long-term lenders
 inkaa hit apane viniyog kii suraksha tathaa us par paryaapt aay praapt karnaa hota he
 They therefore require accounting information to evaluate the past performance of the institution and to explore future prospects, so the employers rely on accounting information included in the financial statements for their investment decisions
 ve jis sanstha main viniyog karnaa chaahate hai, lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par us sanstha kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 Creditors include sellers of goods, bankers and other lenders
 ye rin dene se purv sanstha kii vittiya sthiti jaananaa chaahate hai tathaa is baat se aashwast hona chaahate hai ki sanstha samay par rinon kaa bhugtan kar degi
 In other words, the liquid position of the institution is satisfactory
 sanstha kii taralata sthiti kii jaankaree ke liye inhen chaalu sampattiyon, taral sampattiyon tathaa chaalu dayitvon sambandhi lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo inhen sanstha ke vittiya vivaranon se uplabdh hoti he
 Various government departments and agencies like Company Law Board, Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department, Wing Market etc
 are also interested in financial information of companies
 in agensiyon kaa uddeshy yah aashwast karnaa hota he ki company ne apane lekhon main kar, labhaansh, hris aadi ke sambandh main adhinium kii vyavasthaaon kaa paalan kiya he athwa nahin tathaa apane laabhon evam vittiya sthiti ko sahi va sachche dhang se prastut kiya he athwa nahin
 The government determines the tax payable capacity of business entities on the basis of information received from the statement of accounts
 ye suchanaaen sarkaar kii bhavi kar niti, utpaadan, mulya niyantran, anudaan, license, aayaat-niryaat niti main di jane vaali suvidhaayen aadi kaa aadhaar hoti he
 The government also requires accounting information of business entities to determine national income
 kabhi kabhi sanstha ke utpaadon kaa mulya nirdhaarit karne ke liye bhi moolyankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki upabhoktaaon evam utpaadakon kaa shoshan na ho sake
 Employees are interested in the economic soundness of the institution as the payment of bonuses depends on the benefits earned
 iske atirikt niyoktaaon or shram sanghon ke bich samuhik saudebaaji lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par hi kii jaati he
 Accounting information, which is said to mirror the financial performance of a business institution, is very valuable to researchers
 ek kaary vishesh kii vittiya kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye shodhakartaaon ko kray, vikray, chaalu sampatti evam daayitv, sthaayee sampattiyaan, dirghakaalin daayitv, swaamiyon ke kosh aadi ke bare main vistrut lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, aisi suchanaaen sanstha dwaara rakhe gayi lekhankan abhilekhon se hi praapt kii ja sakati hai
 Each transaction has two aspects or parties
 khaataa-bahi main prayek paksh kaa ek khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 An account is that part of an ledger in which a collective statement of transactions made in relation to a person, goods or services is written
 is prakaar prayek khate kii sthiti kaa pataa lag jaataa he ki vah khaataa lender he tathaa dendar 
 According to the dual system it is necessary to know the classification of accounts in order to write transactions in sources
 jin khaaton kaa sambandh kisi vishesh vyakti se hota he, ve vyaktigat khate kehalaate hai
 An individual means an individual, firm, company and any other type of business entity
 duusare shabdon main, sab lendaaron tathaa dendaaron ke khate vyaktigat khate hote hai
 From this point of view, the accounts of capital and withdrawal are also personal as these transactions related to the owner of the business are written
 vyapaar ke swami ke vyaktigat khate ko puunji khaataa kaha jaataa he
 Withdrawal account is opened by the business owner to withdraw money from the business
 is prakaar aaharan khaataa bhi vyaktigat khaataa hota he
 Accounts of goods and property are called real accounts
 in khaaton ko vaastavik isliye kaha jaataa he ki inamen varnit vasteen, vishesh sampatti ke rup main vyapaar main prayog kii jaati he
 The merchant can convert his capital into money by selling them when needed
 vaastavik khate aarthik chitthey main sampatti kii tarah dikhaaye jate hai
 Such as machines, buildings, goods, machinery, furniture, cash and banks etc
 are the actual accounts
 in khaaton ko avastavik khate bhi kehete hai
 Business consists of many expenditure items, income items and profit or loss items
 in sabake liye alag-alag khate banate hai jinako ‘nammaatr’ ke khate kehete hai
 They have no tangible basis like personal or real accounts
 udhaaharan ke liye vetan, mazdooree, kamishan, byaaj ityadi ke khate nammaatr ke khate hote hai
 Each transaction has two sides
 rini yaa debit paksh or dhani yaa credit paksh
 For this reason, each account has two parts to write its account
 baayen haath kii ore bhaag ‘rini paksh’ hota he or daahine haath kii ore kaa bhaag ‘dhani paksh’ hota he
 Debit or credit to accounts - When an account is a 'lane' party in a transaction, that is, it gets debited then the accounts are debited
 debit karne kaa matlab yah he ki khate ke rini bhaag main lenden kaa lekha hoga
 Similarly, when an account is a party to a transaction, that is, someone gains something from it, then that account is credited
 arthath us khate ke credit bhaag main lenden kaa lekha kiya jayega
 In this transaction one account and another account are credited in this way
 debit khate main debit kii ore lekha tathaa credit khate main credit kii ore lekha hota he
 Credit and debit accounting is done for every transaction according to double account system
 udhaaharan - yadi hamane mohan se 100 rupaye kaa maal kharida he to isamen do khate hue- ek maal kaa doosraa mohan kaa
 One account will be done in the account of the receiver ie goods account and the other account will be done in the account of the recipient ie Mohan
 isi kaaran is pranali ko dohare lekhe kii pranali kaha gaya he
 Each transaction has two accounts, a debit and a credit

 G
 Batista del Porta, in his famous book Magia Naturalis, has written the method of making lenses by grinding glass
 thode sudhaar ke saath abhi bhi vahi vidhi kaam main laai jaati he
 a piece of glass is broken with a hammer, or a saddle, to form a lens shape
 uttal lens banane ke liye pyaale ke aakaar kaa or avatal lens banane ke liye gumbad ke aakaar kaa yantra lohe ke ek chad ke upar laga rahata he, jise bijli ke motor dwaara ghumaya jaataa he
 The curvature-radius of these instruments is equal to the desired curvature-radius of the lens
 kaanch ke tukade ko isi yantra main ghisa jaataa he or ghisne ke liye kaanch or yantra ke bich main ret kaa upyog karte hai
 Nowadays, the powder of Carborundum is used instead of sand
 jaise-jaise lens ghisata he, adhik shuddh yantra lagaate jate hai or churna bhi patala prayukt karte jate hai
 After grinding, ferric-oxide is polished on the lens
 polish karte samay ghisnevaale yantra par mom, yaa pich kii patali parat jamaa dete hai
 After grinding both the surfaces of the lens, its edges are grilled and made round
 aajkal heere kaa churna laga yantra vakrata paidaa karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 If a circular ring of radius less than its radius of curvature is placed on a spherical surface, the ring will fit exactly on the spherical surface
 chakkar lagaate hue pyaale ke aakaar kaa yantra, jiske kinaaron par heere kaa churna laga rahata he is tarah samanjit kiya jaataa he ki iskaa ghurnan aksh lens ke aksh ko vaanchit goleey sataha ke vakratakendre par kaatai
 The device is bent such that its edge cuts the lens in the middle
 jab lens or yantra apane apane aksh par chakkar lagaate hai, tab vaanchit vakrata-trigya kaa lens banataa he
 For good wear and polish, a very pure curvature-radius machine is used and Carvorandum powder is also very finely taken
 ghiste samay churna ke kan bhinn bhinn aakaar ke kanon main tut jate hai
 When using the powder again, it is necessary to separate the particles of different sizes, because the presence of a particle of larger size in the thin powder will also cause scratches in the lens
 bhinn bhinn aakaar ke kan pani kii dhara pravaahit kar alag kiye jate hai, kyonki pani main pravaahit karne par samaan aakaar ke kan ek sthaan par ekatrit hote hai
 To create a more pure curvature-radius lens, place the worn lenses as a group on an iron instrument as described earlier
 lenson kii upree sataha par pich kaa ek chota batan bana diya jaataa he or nichali sataha ko bhigokar kuch der ke liye yantra se chipka diya jaataa he
 Heats each other frame of iron and puts it over the buttons on the lenses
 garmi se batan mulaayam ho jate hai or upree dhaanche se chipak jate hai
 The entire device is cooled with cold water, adding a cluster of lenses to the upper structure
 ghiste samay nichalaa yantra urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore ghumta he, jab ki upree dhaanchaa ek ore se duusari ore dolan karata he
 When polishing, place a second machine in place of the bottom wear, which has a thin layer of pitch on its surface
 polish karne ke yantra par lage pich kii sataha kii vakrata kii trigya, yantra ko vipareet vakrata vaale yantra se dabaakar thik karte hai
 This is why pairs of polishing instruments are made, the surface of one member of the pair is convex and the concave of the other
 ghisne or polish karne kii kriya ke sambandh main logon ke bhinn bhinn vichaar he
 But it is so certain that at the time of grinding, the particles present in the powder of Carborundum exert pressure on the glass, so that small pieces of glass are cut out of the glass and the shape of the lens becomes glass
 is samay kaanch kii sataha khurdari hoti he
 Regarding the action of polish, some people think that this action is also an action of wear
 parantu aajkal carborandam ke churna kii jagah par ferick oxide kaa upyog hone se emry ke kan bahut chote hote hai
 According to the second ideology, ferric oxide particles settle on the pitch surface and they, like sandpaper, grind the surface of the lens to make it uniform and smooth everywhere
 lens kaa centre uske pradhan aksh par hona chahie
 To do this, two identical cups of steel are taken
 pyaalon ke kinaaron ke bich lens kaa is tarah se kas dete hai ki donon pyaale samaaksh hon
 In this case the axis of the cups will be the axis of the lens
 iske baad pyaalon ko ghumaate hue lens ke kinaaron ko ghisne ke yantra par ghis lete hai
 If the rays of light fall perpendicular to the surface of the polished glass, then part of the total light is reflected from the surface, where mu is the refractive index of the glass
 saadhaaran kaanch ke liye yah bhaag kul prakaash kaa 4 pratishat he, parantu camera lenson ke liye yah bhaag lagbhag 7 pratishat hota he
 Due to this many difficulties are present
 nai paalish kiye gaye lens kii apeksha kuch dhundle satahavaale lenson ke liye yah bhaag kam hota he
 In 1936, John Strong observed that by the depositing of a thin layer of vapor of calcium fluoride on the surface of the lens in vacuum, the amount of light reflected by the lens decreases
 aajkal praaia: sabhi lenson kii satahon par vashpikrut megnesium-fluoride kii halaki parat jamaa di jaati he
 This reduces the reflected portion of light by the surface of the lens to 1 percent to 2 percent of the total light
 goleey vipathan or varna vipathan ko hataane ke liye bhinn padaarthon ke do, yaa kai leson ko paardarshak cement se jodkar sanyukt lens banaate hai
 Until 1940, canada balsam was used as cement
 canada balsam se jude lens bahut nimna taap par alag ho jate hai, at: aajkal praaia: butil methacrillate cement ke rup main prayukt hota he
 Hot cement is applied to the surface of the lens to be added and additional cement is removed by rubbing the lenses
 camera, doordarshak, sookshmdarshi ityadi ke abhidrishyak or netrika lens sanyukt lens hote hai
 Due to the uneven thermal expansion of the crown glass and flint glass, lenses with a diameter of more than three inches are not joined by cement
 aise lenson ko kuch duuri par rakhaa jaataa he, parantu yadi unhen paas rakhana aavashyak ho to bhi ve is tarah rakhe jate hai ki ek duusare ko na chhuen
 To do this they are stuck in a metal frame
 kabhi kabhi lenson ke kinaaron ko frem main cement dwaara jod bhi diya jaataa he
 Often the surface of lenses is spherical, because it is such a geometric shape that it can be made with absolute precision and ease
 agoleey lens vipareet vakrata ke velnaakaar yantra par ghiskar banaaya jaataa he
 The rotating axis of the device should be parallel to the axis of the lens while grinding
 yadi lens bhi chakkar lagane ke liye swatantra hoga, to belanaakaar ke sthaan par goleey ho jayega
 Therefore, the lens must be fixed while grinding
 yadi kisi lens kaa aksh hi ghurnan aksh ho, parantu lens kii sataha goleey na ho, to aise lens ko agoli lens kehete hai
 Such lenses are made by rubbing on the desired size wear machine
 agoli lens kaa prayog sangrahi lens ke rup main tathaa dwinetri kii netrika evam kuch camaron main hota he
 Glass absorbs ultraviolet and infrared light
 at: spectrum ke parabegni kshetra main calcium fluoride, lithium fluoride, quartz ityadi ke lens prayukt hote hai
 The infrared region of the spectrum uses potassium iodide, arsenic sulfide, silver chloride, thallium bromide-iodide silicon, and germanium lenses
 jab plastic padaarthon ko ooshmaa dwaara galaakar lens banaaya jaataa he, tab ve saste bhi padate hai or halake bhi
 Nowadays there have been efforts to make plastic visible lenses of visionary and camera
 ek samuchit methacrillate ko crown kaanch or polistirin ko finlat kii jagah lagaaya gaya, parantu ardrata or taap aadi ke prabhaav se plastic padaarthon main parivartan hone ke kaaran bahut si samasyaayen paidaa ho jaati he
 While grinding the lens, it is repeatedly checked whether the surface is spherical and whether the lens is of the desired radius of curvature
 pital kii ek plate ke bahari kinare ke, jo gol or vaanchit lens kii vakrata trigya ke baraabar trigya kaa hota he, lens kii sataha par rakhte hai or dekhte hai ki vah thik baithta he yaa nahin
 If it does not fit well, then the lens is then rubbed accordingly
 adhik shuddhta ke liye paalish karte samay phir jaanch kii jaati he
 For this, a glass test plate is used, whose radius of curvature is equal to the desired curvature radius of the lens with the opposite sign, ie if the lens is convex and its curvature radius is 25 cm
 , The test plate will be concave and its radius of curvature is also 25 cm
 Will be
 yadi lens thik hoga, to lens or pareekshan patt kii satahon ke bich hawa kaa samaantar film banegaa
 a ray of light will appear only one color after reflection from both surfaces of the film and the color of the reflected ray will depend on the thickness of the film
 parantu lens kii sataha goleey na hone par athwa vakrata trigya thik na hone par, prayek bindu par film kii motaai bhinn hogi or film main newton balay banegaa
 The lens is then repositioned slightly by grinding
 chikitsa bhautikee ke antargat bhautikee ke siddhanton kaa chikitsa ke kshetra main anuprayogon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Often it involves medical imaging and radiotherapy
 prayogon se pataa chalata he ki bhautikee ke niyamon kaa paalan maanav sharir main bhi hot he
 For example, when humans were placed in a special thermometer, it was measured how much heat is produced in the body and it was calculated how much heat could be produced by burning as much of the diet as it was digested and when it was also taken into consideration that sweat How much cold must have arisen in drying, then it became clear that all the energy of the body is produced in the stomach and bowel by digestion and digestion of food; There is no secret store of energy in the body
 vividh padaarthon ke gholon kaa gun unamem vartmaan hydrogen yanon kii sandratha par nirbhar rahata he
