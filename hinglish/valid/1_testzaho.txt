 Then Ganga said that when i come to Earth from such a height, how will the Earth be able to bear such a velocity? Then Bhagiratha pleaded with Lord Shiva and he opened a braid, stopping the velocity of the Ganges in his open jatas, causing the incessant current of the Ganges to flow to the earth
 vah dhara bhageerath ke peeche-peeche ganga-sagar sangam tak gayin, jahaan sagar-putron kaa uddhaar hua
 At the touch of Shiva, Ganga became even more holy and became a center of reverence for the people of Earth

 Archimedes died c 212 BC The Second Punic War took place when Roman armies led by General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year siege
 plutark ke dwaara die gaye lokapriy vivaran ke anusaar, archimedes ek ganitiya chitra par vichaar kar rahe the, jab shahar par kabza kiya gaya
 a Roman soldier ordered him to come and meet General Marcellus, but he refused, saying that he had to complete work on his problem
 isse sainik naaraaz ho gaya or usne apni talwaar se archimedes ko maar daalaa
 Plutarch also gives an account of the death of Archimedes, less-known, stating that he was probably killed when he was attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier
 is kahani ke anusaar, archimedes ganitiya upkaran le ja rahe the or unhen isliye maar diya gaya kyonki sainik ne sochaa ki ye keemtee saamaan he
 General Marcellus is said to have been greatly enraged by Archimedes' death, as he considered him an invaluable scientific asset and ordered that Archimedes should not be harmed in any way
 mana jaataa he ki archimedes ke antim shabd the, "mere vruton ko pareshaan mat karo ", yahaan vruton kaa sandarbh us ganitiya chitra ke vruton se he jise archimedes us samay adhyayan kar rahe the jab roman sainik ne unhen pareshaan kiya
 These words are often described in Latin as "noli turbare circulos meos", but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they are not found in the description given by Plutarch
 archimedes ke makbare par unka pasandida ganitiya pramaan chitrit kiya hua he, jisamen samaan unchai or vyas kaa ek gola or ek belan he

 The account of the siege of Syracuse given by Polybius was written in his Universal History about 70 years after the death of Archimedes and was later used as a source by Plutarch and Livy
 yah ek vyakti ke rup main archimedes par thodaa prakaash daalata he or un yuddh mashiinon par dhyaan kendrit karata he, jinhen mana jaataa he ki unhone shahar kii raksha karne ke liye banaaya tha
 The most widely known fact about Archimedes is how he discovered a method for determining the volume of an object of an irregular shape
 vitruvius ke anusaar, raja hero II ke liye ek lorel vreth ke aakaar kaa ek nayaa mukut banaaya gaya tha or archimedes se yah pataa lagane ke liye kaha gaya ki yah mukut shuddh sone se bana he yaa beyimaan sunar ne isamen chaandi milaayi he
 Archimedes had to solve this problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it into a regular-sized object to calculate its density
 nahaate samay, unhone dekha ki jab ve tub ke andar gaye, tub main pani kaa str upar uth gaya or unhone mahasoos kiya ki is prabhaav kaa upyog mukut ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Water cannot be compressed for practical purposes, so the submerged crown will replace its volume with equal amounts of water
 mukut ke bhaar ko pratisthapit pani ke aaytan se vibhajit karke, mukut kaa ghanatv praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If cheap and low density metals are added to it, then its density will be less than gold
 phir kya tha, archimedes apni is khoj se itane zyada uttejit ho gaye ki ve kapadey pahananaa hi bhul gaye or nagn avasthaa main galiyon main bhaagate hue chillane lage "ureka !" The story of the gold crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes
 iske alaava, pani ke visthaapan ke maapan main aavashyak sateekta kii atyadhik maatra ke kaaran, iske dwaara varnit vidhi kii vyavhaarikta par sawaal uthaaye gaye hai
 Perhaps Archimedes gave a solution that applied to a theory called Archimedes' theory in hydrology, which he describes in one of his texts on floating bodies
 is siddhant ke anusaar ek taral main dubi hui vastu par ek utplavan bal lagata he jo iske dwaara hathaaye gaye taral ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the gold crown with solid gold, for which the crown would have been first balanced on a scale with a sample of gold, then the mechanism would have been immersed in water
 
 yadi mukut sone se kam ghanaa tha, isane apane adhik aaytan ke kaaran adhik pani ko pratisthapit kiya hoga or is prakaar is par lagane vaale utplavan bal kii maatra namoonay se adhik rahi hogi
 This difference in buoyancy may have been seen on the scale
 galileo ne mana ki "sambhavatya archimedes ne isi vidhi kaa upyog kiya hoga, chunki, bahut sateek hone ke saath, yah khud archimedes ke dwaara die gaye pradarshan par aadhaarit he

 Athenaeus of the Greek writer Naukratis described how King Heron II asked Archimedes to design a huge ship, the Siracusia, to be used for luxury voyages, to supply goods, and as a naval warship
 Could
 mana jaataa he ki syracusia pracheen kaal kaa sabase bada jahaaj tha
 According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people, plus its facilities included a garden decoration, a gymnasium and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite

 Archimedes' claw is a weapon that he is believed to have designed to protect the city of Syracuse
 ise "da ship shiker " ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, is panje main ek kraine ke jaisi bhujaa thi, jisase ek bada dhaatu kaa hook lataka hua tha
 When this claw was placed on the ship in an attack, the arm would lift up and lift the ship out of the water and possibly sink it

 The writer of the 2nd century AD, Lucian, wrote that during the siege of Syracuse, Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire
 sadiyon baad trallege ke anthemiyas ne jalte hue kaanch kaa ullekh archimedes ke hathiyaar ke rup main kiya
 This device, sometimes called the "archimedes' heat beam", was used to focus sunlight onto the target ship, causing it to fire
 yah kathith hathiyaar punarjagran ke baad se hi bahes kaa vishay rahaa he
 René Descartes dismissed it as a misnomer, while modern scientists have tried to reproduce the effect using only the tools available to Archimedes

 When mythbusters aired San Francisco results in January 2006, the claim was categorized as "unsuccessful", as the appropriate length of time and ideal weather conditions are mandatory for this combustion to occur

 Mythbusters also stated that conventional weapons, such as flaming arrows or arrows sent from a slingshot, are a much easier way to burn a ship from short distances
 jabaki archimedes ne liver kii khoj nahin kii, unhone isamen shaamil siddhant kaa kathor vivaran sabase pehle diya
 According to Pappus of Alexandria, from his work on leavers, he commented: "give me a place to stand and i will move the earth
" Plutarch described how Archimedes designed the block-and-tackle pulley system, whereby sailors used the principle of leverage to lift objects that were so heavy they would otherwise be too difficult to move
 archimedes ko gulel kii kshamta or sateekta ke sudhaar kaa shrey bhi diya gaya he or pehle punik yuddh ke dauraan unhone odometer kaa avishkaar kiya
 The odometer is described as the system of a carriage consisting of a gear, which puts a ball into a vessel after every mile run

 is samvaad ke anusaar marcelas ne ek upkaran ko seracus se kii gayi apni nijee lut ke rup main rakhaa or anya sabhi ko rome main temple of varchew ko daan kar diya
 According to Cicero the system of Marcellus was represented by Lucas Fierias Philus by Gaius Sulpicus Gelus, who described it as: yah ek taramandal yaa oreri ) kaa varnan he
 Pappus of Alexandria stated that Archimedes wrote a manuscript on the construction of these specified systems On sphere-making

 Although Archimedes is often called the designer of mechanical devices, he also contributed to the field of mathematics
 plutark ne likhaa tha: "unhone un shuddh vivaranon main apana puraa sneh or mahatvakanksha daal di, jahaan jivan kii asabhy jaruraton ke liye koi sandarbh nahin ho saktaa
" Archimedes could use infinite series in the same way as in modern integral calculus

 This technique is called the method of completeness and he used it to find the approximate value of)
 unhone iske liye ek vrath ke baahar ek bada bahubhuj chitrit kiya or vrath ke bheetar ek chota bahubhuj chitrit kiya
 As the number of sides of a polygon increases, the approximation of the vow becomes more precise

 He also proved that the area of the vrats was equal to the product of the square of π and the radius of the vow
 ek vrath ke maapan main, archimedes 3 ke varg mul ke maan ko 265⁄153 se adhik or 1351⁄780 se kam bataate hai
 The actual value is about 1
7320508 which is a very accurate estimate
 unhone is parinaam ko dene ke saath, ise praapt karne main prayukt vidhi kaa koi spashtikaran nahin diya
 Because of this aspect of Archimedes' work, John Wallis remarked that he: "deliberately wanted to conceal his investigation as if he wanted to keep his method of investigation a mystery while exposing its results
" " In calculating the square of the parabola, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4⁄3 times the area of the triangle within it, as shown in the right and given figure
 unhone is samasya ke hal ko saamaanya anupaat se yukt ek aparimit jyamitiya shrinkhalaa ke rup main vyakt kiya1⁄4: If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the area of the two triangles, whose bases are two small cornered lines and so on
 This proof series uses a variation of 1 / 4 + 1 / 16 + 1 / 64 + 1 / 256 + · · ·, the sum of which is 1⁄3
 da send riconor main, archimedes ne is brahmand main upasthit mitti ke kanon kii sankhya kii gananaa karne ke liye ek samucchy diya
 In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of soil particles is so large that it cannot be counted
 unhone likhaa: "kuch log, raja gelo sochate hai ki mitti kii sankhya anant main aparimit he; or meraa maananaa he ki mitti na keval seracus or shesh sicili main he balki har us kshetra main he jahaan awaas he yaa awaas nahin he
 To solve this problem, Archimedes gave a system of calculations based on the myriad

 yah shabd kii utpatti 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan sanyukt rajya america main vishesh rup se los angeles, california main ek sthaneey tivi stesan KTLA par samachar-vaachakon dwaara hui

 The following are common expressions of expressing anger on the road: america main AAA foundation adhyayan ke anusaar 300 se adhik sadak par rosh vyakt karne ke maamalon kaa parinaam gambhir chot or yahaan tak ki maut bhi rahaa he - prati varsh 1200 ghatnaon kaa record he or chah saal ke adhyayan ke anusaar yah vaarshik rup se bad rahaa he jisaki jaanch police rashtriya str par karti he
 In some jurisdictions there can be legal differences between "expressing fury on the road" and "aggressive driving"
 america main, kuch rajyon ne hi vishesh aakraamak driving kanoon adhiniyamit kiye he, jahaan sadak par rosh vyakt karne jaise maamalon main - prati varsh lagbhag 1200 - par saamaanya rup se hamalaa or bydaree, yaa "sawari sambandhi manushya hatya" ke mukademe chalaaye jate hai

 According to an article published by the Associated Press in June 2006, the behavior usually associated with expressing road rage is the result of an explosive disorder caused by innings
 yah nishkarsh 2001 or 2003 ke bich rajya america main kuch 9200 vayaskon ke sanyukt surveykshan dwaara liya gaya tha or yah maansik swasthya ke rashtriya santhaan dwaara vitt poshit hua he
 The reason for the explosive disorder caused by the innings has not been written to date
 "sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa" ek maansik samasya he yaa nahin, is baat par bhinn vichaar rahe hai
 There are many alternative solutions to overcome this obstacle, whether it is or not
 sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa apekshaakrit ek gambhir kaary he: ise janata kii suraksha ke liye khatre ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 However, investigation of intent by external observation is not always possible so "road razors" who are caught by police are charged with other offenses such as careless or inattentive driving
 
 kuch nyaayalayon jaise varjeenia kaa america rashtramandal main, sadak par rosh vyakt karne par aakraamak driving ke bajaay laaparvaah driving ke rup main mukadmaa chalaanaa aasaan he kyonki saboot ke boj ke kaaran safaltaapurvak doshi siddh karne ke liye "aashay" kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 It is likely that those who result in serious injury or death during "expressing fury on the road" events will suffer more severe penalties than simple negligence applied to similar consequences

 Only one state, California, has given it a special meaning to express indignation on the street, turning it into a legal term for art
 haalanki yah dhyaan dene yogya baat nahin he ki varjeenia main aakraamak driving ko laaparvaah driving kii tulana main ek kam aparaadh ke rup main sajaa di gayi he
 Expressing street fury in New Zealand is still technically legal and is still considered socially acceptable behavior
 kanoon kii samiksha ke liye kol ke baavjood bhi, newjiland sarkaar kaa australia jaise anya deshon kii tarah "sadak par rosh vyakt karne ke virdohi" kanoon prastut karne kii koi naveenatam yojana nahin he
 Although technically "chasing" motorists and willfully damaging their vehicles is a crime, the police generally do not consider such acts as a 'high priority' and called it an "insurance thing"
 It means that if a passenger has intentionally damaged his / her vehicle in the event of expressing anger on a road, then it is a case of insurance companies of both the parties rather than criminal cases
 Do depends on A
 So what will they solve it have short road rage in New Zealand is still legal and the police ignore such acts unless that person is killed

 Permanent chairman pichley sah adhyaksh Shanti mantras are the mantras of the Vedas that pray for peace
 praaia: hinduon ke dharmik krityon ke armbh or ant main inkaa paath kiya jaataa he
 Shanti Mantras are found in Upanishads, where they are invoked in the beginning of some topics of Upanishads
 They are supposed to calm the mind of reciter and environment around him / her
 Reciting them is also believed to be removing any obstacles for the task being started
 Shanti Mantras always end with three utterances of word "shanti" which means "peace"
 The Reason for uttering three times is for calming and removing obstacles inthree realms which are: "physical" or physics, "divine" or adhidaivik and "internal" or spiritual According to the scriptures of Hinduism sources of obstacles and troubles are in these three realms
 Physical or adhi-bhautika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from external world, such as from wild animals, people, natural calamities etc
 Divine or adhi-daivika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming fromextra-sensory world of spirits, ghosts, deities, demigods / angels etc
 Internal or Adhyaatmika realm is source of troubles / obstacles arising out of ones own body and mind, such as pain, diseases, laziness, absent-mindedness etc
 These are called "tapa-traya" or three classes of troubles
when Shanti mantras are recited, obstacles from these realms are believed to bepacified

 In Christianity, baptism is a religious act performed with the use of water, by which a person is granted membership of the church
 swayan isa messiah kaa baptism kiya gaya tha
 Among early Christians, the "dipping of the candidate" in whole or in part was the usual form of baptism

 In the early history of the Church, martyrdom was recognized as "baptism with blood", so that those martyrs who were not baptized by water could be saved
 Later, the Catholic Church identified baptism by will, by which those who were preparing for baptism were considered safe, but who died before they could actually complete the funeral
 kuch isai, vishishtatah quekar tathaa mukti sena, baptism ko aavashyak nahin maanate or na hi ve is rivaaj kaa paalan karte hai
 In those who follow it, differences can also be seen in terms of the method and medium of baptism and the understanding of the importance of this custom
 adhikansh isai "pita ke, tathaa putr ke, tathaa pavitra aatma ke naam par" baptism lete hai kaa paalan karte hue), lekin kuch log keval isa messiah ke naam par baptism lete hai
 Most Christians baptize infants; Many others believe that only baptism of the believer is true baptism
 kuch log is baat par bal dete hai ki baptism le rahe vyakti kaa nimajjan kiya jaae yaa use kam se kam aanshik rup se duboya jaae, jabaki anya log yah maanate hai ki jal ke dwaara nahalaae jane kaa koi bhi rup paryaapt he, jab tak ki jal sir par pravaahit ho rahaa ho
 The English word "baptism" has also been used to refer to any religious event, use or experience in which a person is initiated or purified or given a name
 anya diksha samarohon ko neeche dekhen
 Since there are differences among Christians following various traditions as to whether baptism is required to be fully immersed, the appropriate meaning of this Greek word has become important for discussion
 lidele or scot kaa greek-angreji shabdkosh us shabd kaa praathmik arth "dubkee lagaana, ghota lagaana" ke rup main detaa he βαπτίζω ke rup main lipyantarit), jisase angreji shabd "baptism " grahan kiya gaya he, lekin ek udhaaharan ke rup main Luke 11:38 suchit karata he ki iskaa ek anya arth "prakshalan" he
 Although the only meaning of the Greek word βαπτίζω is not to dive, dive, or sink, literal sources indicate that this is the common meaning of both the Septuagint and the New Testament
 isse sambandhit ek shabd, βάπτω, kaa prayog bhi nayaa qaraar main "dubkee lagaana" yaa "rangana" ke arth main kiya gaya he, dubkee apurna ho sakati he, jaise sharaab main bread ke ek tukade ko dubona 
 Two passages of the New Testament indicate that when the word βαπτίζω is applied to a person, it does not always inform immersion
 inamen se pehla ljuk 11:38 he, jo yah bataata he ki kis prakaar ek pakhand, jiske ghar isa messiah ne bhojan kiya tha, "yah dekhakar stabdh rah gaya ki bhojan se purv unhone apane haath nahin dhoye 
" yahi vah pariched he, jiskaa ullekh lidele or scot ne nimajjan karne ke arth main βαπτίζω ke prayog ke udhaaharan ke rup main karte hai
 Not following this action by Jesus Christ is the same as his disciples: "then the apostles and the hypocrites of Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, why do your followers violate the tradition of the ancestors? Because they don't Wash their hands, when they eat food
 " nayaa qaraar ke jis anya pariched kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, vah he: "dikhaawati log


tab tak bhojan nahin karte, jab tak ki ve dho na len apane haathon ko puri tarah, apane purvajon kii parampara kaa paalan karte hue; or jab ve bazaar se lautate hai, to ve tab tak nahin khate, jab tak ki ve swayan ko puri tarah dho na len "
 Scholars of various denominations claim that these two passages indicate that invited guests or those returning from the market should not be expected to completely submerge themselves in water, but only to partially submerge their hands in water Or should be expected to sprinkle water on themselves, as adopted by the current Jewish system
 zodiats or balz va shnider ke shabd-vigyaan sambandhi kaary bhi kehete hai ki inamen se duusari sthiti main, Mark 7:4, βαπτίζω shabd kaa arth yah he ki bazaar se aane ke baad, pakhand log ekatrit kiye gayi pani main keval apane haathon main dubote the or ve swayan ko puri tarah nahin dubote the
 They understand that the word βαπτίζω means the same as βάπτω, to submerge or immerse, a term used to partially submerge a piece of hand in alcohol or a finger in dilated blood
 nae qaraar main βαπτίζω se vyutpann do sangyaayen praapt hoti hai: βαπτισμός or βάπτισμα
 In Mark 7: 4, Βαπτισμός refers to a water-related ritual performed for the purpose of purification, washing, and ablution of plates; In the same verse and in Hebrews 9:10 the lentical ablution of Bertanos or the body; And possibly baptism in Hebrews 6: 2, though there it may refer to the washing of any inanimate material
 Colossians 2:12 main, gaun pandulipiyon main βάπτισμα he, lekin sarvshereshth main βαπτισμός he or nae qaraar ke aadhunik samalochanatmak sanskarnon main yahi arth diya gaya he
 This is the only example of the New Testament, in which βαπτισμός is explicitly mentioned in the sense of Christian baptism, not in the sense of general washing, but Hebrews 6: 2 may also refer to baptism
 jab yah keval upkarnon ke prakshalan ko sanderbhit kar rahaa ho, βαπτισμός kii tulana ῥαντισμός ke saath kii gai he, jo keval Hebrews 12:24 or 1peter 1:2 main miltaa he, ek aisa shabd jiskaa prayog puraane qaraar ke padri dwaara sankethik prakshalan ko suchit karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 Βάπτισμα, which should not be confused with βαπτισμός, is found only in writings by Christians
 nayaa qaraar main yah kam se kam 21 baar dikhaai detaa he: Baptism has been a part of Christianity from the very beginning, as demonstrated in numerous references in Acts of the Apostles and Paolin Epistles
 isai maanate hai ki baptism kaa sanskaar isa messiah ne prarambh kiya tha
 How clear Jesus' intentions were and whether he envisioned a continuing, orderly church is a matter of debate among scholars
 haalanki "baptism" shabd kaa prayog yahudee karmkand kaa varnan karne ke liye nahin kiya jaataa, lekin yahudee niyamon or parampara main shuddhikaran sanskaar -dharmik nimajjan) kii baptism ke saath kuch samanta he or ye donon aapas main jude hue hai
 In the Jewish Bible and other Jewish books, immersion in water was established to restore the state of "sacramental purification" under specific circumstances for sacramental purification

 Immersion is necessary for the converts to the Jewish sect according to their rules

 Broadly, scholars agree that the baptism of Jesus is the most authentic, or historically similar, event in the events of the life of Jesus

 Some prominent scholars conclude that Jesus was not baptized
 gard thisan tathaa anet marz daawa karte hai ki isa kaa baptism nahin hua, unhone baptism se praayshchitt ke vichaar ko alag nahin kiya, jon ke baptism ko manyata nahin di or baptism se jude tanaav main ek shuddhta-sambandhi naitik aacharan prastaavit nahin kiya

 Robert W
 Funk views the baptismal group of Jesus in John as having internal contradictions: for example, it refers to the Judean arrival of Jesus, while he was already in Jerusalem and thus in Judea
 John 3:22 vastutah isa or unke shishyon ke "εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν" aane kii baat nahin kahata, balki "εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν γῆν" aane kii baat kahata he, jise kuch log jerusalem samaj lete hai, jo ki nicodemas ke saath hui us bhent kaa sthaan tha, jiskaa varnan thik pehle kiya gaya he
 According to the Jesus Seminar, the passage "judea Advent" about Jesus leading the baptism mission probably does not contain any historical information
 duusari ore, cambridge compainian tu jisas kaa ek bhinn drushtikon he
 According to this source, Jesus accepted the baptismal John's message of atonement, forgiveness, and baptism and made it his own; Taking this from John, when he was imprisoned, he appealed to adopt atonement and baptism as the first step in accepting God's soon-coming kingdom; And John's passage about Jesus' baptism confirms the central location of baptism in his message

 New Testament scholar Raymond E
 Brown, an expert in Johannine writings, maintains that this editorial commentary written by John 4: 2 among the brackets that Jesus was baptized only through his disciples, twice in the preceding verse It was written for the purpose of clarifying or correcting the repeated statement that Jesus was baptized and the reason for this entry may have been that the author thought it was That the baptism managed by the disciples was merely an attempt to continue the baptismal work, not baptism in the Holy Spirit

 "under his elaborate doctrine, in particular portions of infant baptism, Luther argues that infant baptism is favored by God because the people thus baptized have been reborn and exonerated by the Holy Spirit
 baptism kii sanskaratmak sthiti ko nakaarte hue swiss sudhaarak haldrich zwingli lutheron se matbhed rakhte hai
 Xingli considered baptism and the Lord's Supper as sacraments, but only as a preparatory event
 His idea of treating these rites as symbolic distinguishes him from Luther

 They considered the baptism of infants to be non-biblical because they could not express their faith and since they had not yet committed any sins, they did not equally need salvation

 "nimajjan" shabd puraane latin shabd imarsiyonem se liya gaya he, jo immerger kriya se praapt kii gai ek sangya he
 In the context of baptism, some people use it to refer to immersion in any way, whether the body is kept completely underwater or only partially submerged in water; In this way they talk about total or partial immersion

 The term "immersion" is also used for another form of baptism, in which water is sprinkled on a person standing in water without the person's immersion
 "nimajjan" shabd ke in teen arthon ke liye, nimajjan baptism dekhen
 When "immersion" is used as opposed to "submerge", it denotes the type of baptism in which the candidate is standing or kneeling in water, and water is sprinkled on the upper part of his body

 Particularly in front of watchers, the ritual of complete immersion expresses a burial process, and resurrection — a "burial" of an old way of life centered on "death" and sin, and as a Christian centered on God a "resurrection" to start a new life
 Typically such Christians believe that John 3: 3-5 also supports this view because it implied that water baptism symbolizes the "rebirth" of a Christian spiritually

 for you are not under the Law, but under grace
 1
 Therefore, i shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber, were symbolic
2
 As soon, then, as you entered, you put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds
 Having stripped yourselves, you were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree
 For since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, you may no longer wear that old garment; i do not at all mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxes corrupt in the lusts of deceit
 May the soul which has once put him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, i have put off my garment, how shall i put it on? o wondrous thing! You were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed; for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed
3
 Then, when you were stripped, you were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ
4
 After these things, you were led to the holy pool of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes
 And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial of Christ



 And at the self-same moment you were both dying and being born; This symbolism is three-tier: 1
 baptism ko punarjanm kaa ek rup mana jaataa he-"jal tathaa aatma ke dwaara"-baptism kii nagnavastha vyakti ke mul janm kii sthiti ke samanaantar thi
 For example, Saint John Chrysostam calls baptism "λοχείαν", that is, giving birth and "a new form of creation 


 from water and spirit", and later clarifies: "for nothing perceivable was handed over to us by Jesus; but with perceivable things, all of them however conceivable
 This is also the way with the baptism; the gift of the water is done with a perceivable thing, but the things being conducted, i
e
, the rebirth and renovation, are conceivable
 For, if you were without a body, He would hand over these bodiless gifts as naked to you
 But because the soul is closely linked to the body, He hands over the perceivable ones to you with conceivable things " 2
 The removal of clothes represents the "picture of separating the old person from his deeds", so exposing the body before baptism represented the removal of the loop of sinful egoism, so that the "new person", Which is provided by Jesus, can be worn

 jaisaa ki sant siril ne upar kaha he, jaisaa ki aadam tathaa hawwa adanvatika main nagn, masul tathaa sankochahin the, baptism ke dauraan nagnavastha ko usee maasoomiyat tathaa paapahinata kii mul-sthiti ke ek navinikaran ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 Other similarities can also be drawn, such as the exposed position of Jesus during the crucifixion and the crucifixion of the "old man" of the repentant sinner at the time of preparation for baptism

 The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions and the Lutheran and Anglican churches built during the Protestant Renaissance share this view
 udhaaharan ke liye, martin luther ne kaha: To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save
 No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to "be saved"
 To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever
 – Luther's Large Catechism, 1529 The Churches of Christ and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also consider baptism to be necessary for salvation

 catholic parampara ke anusaar baptism ke teen prakaar hai jinke dwaara vyakti ko bachaaya ja saktaa he: sanskaratmak baptism, ichha kaa baptism, tathaa rakt kaa baptism 
 In contrast, most Renaissance, Evangelical, and Protestant Protestant groups believe baptism to be an act of identifying and obeying Jesus as the Messiah
 ve kehete hai ki baptism main koi sanskaratmak shakti nahin hoti or yah keval ishwar kii shakti, jo ki swayan is rasm se purnatah bhinn he, ke adrishy evam aantarik kaary ko bahya rup se jaanchataa he
 The Churches of Christ continually teach that a believer in baptism dedicates his life to faith in God and obedience to him, and that God "frees a person from sin by the superiority of the blood of Jesus and the person Changes the state of it to a citizen of the kingdom of God rather than an outsider
 baptism koi maanviya kaary nahin he; yah vah sthaan he, jahaan ishwar kaary karata he or keval ishwar hi kar saktaa he

66 They thus see baptism as an indirect act of faith rather than a superior act; it is" an acknowledgment that a person has nothing to offer to God

112 In Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist traditions, the method of baptism not only makes a clear reference to baptism for burial and revival, but also considers it a conversion of a supernatural power, a conversion that Noah and Moses The Israelites experience the movement through the Red Sea, divided by

 In these traditions, baptism is performed immediately after the cremation and union with the next divine worship, regardless of age

 They also point to various historical sources that state that the early churches were always baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before the Trinity doctrine was developed in the second century
 1982 main, world council of churches ne ek saarvbhaum patr baptism, ukarist and ministry prakashit kiya
 According to the preamble of this document: Those who know how widely the churches have differed in doctrine and practice on baptism, Eucharist and ministry, will appreciate the importance of the large measure of agreement registered here
 Virtually all the confessional traditions are included in the Commission's membership
 That theologians of such widely different traditions should be able to speak so harmoniously about baptism, Eucharist and ministry is unprecedented in the modern ecumenical movement
 Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the Commission also includes among its full members theologians of the Catholic and other churches which do not belong to the World Council of Churches itself
" a 1997 document, Baking a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism, presented the views of experts brought together under the patronage of the World Council of Churches
 according to this: 


according to Acts 2:38, baptisms follow from Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus and lead those baptized to the receiving of Christ's Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and life in the community: "they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers" as well as to the distribution of goods to those in need
 Those who heard, who were baptized and who entered the life of the community, were already made witnesses and participants of the words of the last days of God: forgiveness of sins by baptism in the name of Jesus and consecrated in the flesh of all To cast the devil
 Similarly, in what can be considered a baptismal pattern, 1 Peter examines the declaration that Jesus' renaissance and preaching to new life resulted in purification and new birth
 Further, after this, the food of God is taken, through participation in community life - state priesthood, new temple, people of God - and further moral construction
 At the beginning of 1 Peter, the author determines baptism in terms of obedience to Jesus and sanctification by the Spirit
 atah isa main baptism ko aatma main baptism ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 cf
 Jesus' discourse with Nicodemus in the Fourth Gospel suggests that birth by water and spirit becomes a merciful means of entry into the place where God is ruled
 chunki catholic, orthodox, anglican, methodist evam lutheran carch yah shiksha dete hai ki baptism ek aisa sanskaar he, jiskaa vaastavik aadhyatmik evam mokshadaayi prabhaav padataa he, atah isaki vaidhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye, arthath in prabhaavon ko vastav main praapt karne ke liye, kuch vishisht pramukh maapdand anivaary rup se sankalit kiye jane chaiye
 yadi in pramukh maapdandon ko purna kiya gaya ho, to baptism ke sandarbh main kuch niyamon kaa ulanghan, jaise is aayojan ke liye praadhikrut rasm main bhinnata, baptism ko shasr-viruddh, lekin phir bhi vaid bana detaa he
 The use of the correct form of words is a criterion for validity
 roman catholic carch ke anusaar ki "baptise " kriya kaa prayog aavashyak he
 Catholics, Anglicans, and Methodists who follow the Latin ritual use "I baptize you


"
 purvi rudhivaadee tathaa kuch purvi catholic "isa ke is sevak kaa baptism kiya gaya he


" athwa "mere haathon is vyakti kaa baptism kiya gaya he


" kaa prayog karte hai
 These churches generally recognize each other's forms of baptism as valid
 "pita ke naam par, putr ke naam par tathaa pavitra aatma ke naam par" ke trimurtiparak niyam kaa prayog bhi aavashyak mana jaataa he; is prakaar ye carch gaiyr-trimurtiparak charchon, jaise vananess pentacostal, ke baptism kii vaidhata ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Another essential condition is the use of water
 ek aisa baptism, jisamen kisi anya drav kaa prayog kiya gaya ho, use vaid nahin mana jaayegaa
 Another requirement is that the organizer intends to be baptized
 This requirement entails only the intention of "doing what the Church does", not Christian reverence, because the effects of this sacrament are not by the person baptized, but by the Holy Spirit functioning through this sacrament
 Are generated by is prakaar, baptism dene vaale kii shraddha par andeh baptism kii vaidhata ke bare main andeh kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Certain conditions do not expressly affect validity — for example, whether immersion, submersion, convergence, or stigma have been used
 haalanki, yadi jal kaa chhidkaav kiya gaya he, to is baat kaa khatara he ki jal ne gaiyr-baptism dhari kii twachaa ko na chuaa ho
 yadi jal twachaa par pravaahit nahin hota, to prakshalan or isi kaaran baptism bhi, nahin hua he
 If water cannot be applied to the head for any medical or any other valid reason, it can be applied to any other major part of the body, such as the chest
 aisi sthitiyon main, vaidhata anishchit hoti he or us vyakti ko us samay tak ke liye sashart rup se baptism-yukt mana jaayegaa, jab tak ki baad main paaramparik paddati se uskaa na kar liya jaye
 For many assemblages, validity is not affected even by doing just one of three dips or immersions, but this is controversial in orthodoxy
 catholic carch ke anusaar, baptism lene vaale vyakti kii aatma par baptism ek amit "chhap" laga detaa he or isaliye jis vyakti kaa baptism pehle hi ho chukaa ho, uskaa baptism punah kiya janaa shasreey rup se maanya nahin he
 This teaching was in contrast to the Donatists, who followed the baptism
 aisa vishwaas he ki baptism main praapt anugrah eks opere oparato sanchalit hota he or isaliye dharmavirohi athwa vicchhinn samoohon main prashasit kiye jane par bhi ise vaid mana jaataa he
 If certain specific terms, including the application of the Trinity law, are followed, the Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches consider baptisms performed by other sects of their group to be valid
 baptism keval ek hi baar lenaa sambhav he, atah anya sampradaayon ke vaid baptism vaale logon kaa baptism dharmantaran athwa sthanantaran ke baad pun nahin kiya janaa chaiye
 aise logon ko vishwaas kii ek pratigya lene par or yadi unhone vaid rup se pushti athwa chrismeshan kaa sanskaar praapt na kiya ho, to pushtikaran ke baad unhen sweekaar kar liya jaataa he
 In some situations, it can be difficult to determine whether the original baptism was actually valid; And if there is any doubt, conditional baptism is administered with a rule in the lines of "if you are not yet baptized, i baptize you


"

 In the major Protestant churches, agreements involving assurances about the method of administering baptism have abolished this method, which sometimes continues for other groups in the Protestant tradition

 The method followed for converts from other converts in the Eastern Orthodox Church is not uniform
 haalanki, pavitra trimurti ke naam par liye gayi baptism ko saamanytah roodhiwaadee chrishchiyan carch dwaara sweekaaryata di jaati he
 If a converted person has not received the sacrament of baptism, it is mandatory to be baptized in the name of the Holy Trinity before being included in the Orthodox Church

 An article published with a formal declaration to that effect also provided the basis for this decision, which is summarized in the following words: "father, son, and baptism in the Catholic Church and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints There are significant differences between the belief in the Holy Spirit and the relationship of its founder to Jesus
 " The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints emphasizes that baptism must be administered by an appropriate authority; As a result, this church does not recognize baptism of any other church

 There is a dispute among Christian churches over who can administer baptism
 naye qaraar main diye gayi udhaaharan keval dharmaduton evam upayajkon ko hi baptism kaa prashasan karte hue pradarshit karte hai
 Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicative that in addition to extreme situations, ie when a person is being baptized for immediate death, baptism should always be performed by a group of priests
 Any person thereafter may baptize, if, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person baptized is a member of the Church, or, in the eyes of the Catholic Church, the person in the administration of this ceremony, even if he is not baptized The purpose of the ho should be what the church does
 anek protestant carch bible ke kisi bhi udhaaharan main koi vishisht nishedh nahin dekhte or kisi bhi shraddhalu ko ek-duusare kaa baptism karne kii anumati dete hai
 The general minister of baptism in the Catholic Church must be a member of a group of priests, but in normal circumstances, the baptized person is legitimately the pastor of the area, or a senior person, or someone authorized by the clergy of the area
 Can do
 "yadi saamaanya mantri anupasthit yaa baadhit ho, to navdharmantariton ko prashikshit karanevaala vyakti athwa sthaneey saamaanya mantri dwaara is karyaalay main niyukt koi anya vyakti hi kanoonee rup se baptism pradaan kar saktaa he; haalanki aavashyak sthiti main, koi bhi vyakti jiske paas aisa karne kaa aavashyak iraadaa ho, vah bhi yah kaary kar saktaa he

 nunatam str par, "aavashyak iraadaa" kaa aashay baptism kii rasm ke madhyam se "jo carch karata he vah karne" kaa iraadaa se he
 In Eastern Catholic Churches, no priest is considered a general minister
 Like the Catholic ceremony, the administration of the sacrament is reserved for the local clergy
 lekin, "aavashyak sthiti main, kisi upayaajak athwa, uski anupasthiti main athwa yadi vah baadhit ho, to kisi anya purohit varg dwaara, jivan ke kisi santhaan ke sadsy dwaara athwa kisi anya isai vishwasakarta dwaara baptism kaa prashasan kiya jaataa he; yahaan tak ki yadi baptism kii vidhi kaa gyaan rakhane vaala koi anya vyakti uplabdh na ho, to mata athwa pita dwaara bhi baptism kaa prashasan kiya jaataa he
 The discipline of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox and the Assyrian Church of the East is the same as the discipline of the Eastern Catholic Churches
 yahaan tak ki aavashyak sthitiyon main bhi, unhen baptism dene vaale ek vyakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo swayan unki vichaardhaara ko maanane vaala ho, is aadhaar par ki koi vyakti kisi anya ko vah vastu nahin de saktaa, jo swayan uske paas na ho, is sthiti main, carch main sadsyta

 In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, only someone who has been duly appointed to the clergy or higher office of the clergy who holds the clergy's authority in Melchizedek Purohity can only administer baptism

 Baptism is seen as the person accepting Jesus Christ as Savior
 praarambhik anabeptiston ko yah naam isaliye diya gaya kyonki ve aise vyaktiyon kaa punarbaptism karte the, jinhen yah mahasoos hota tha ki unka baptism bhalee-bhaanti nahin hua tha kyonki unka baptism unke shishav-kaal main, chhidkaav ke dwaara athwa kisi anya sampradaay dwaara kisi bhi anya prakaar se kiya gaya tha
 In the Anabaptist denomination, baptism is conducted internally in a baptism, in a swimming pool, or in a bathtub, or externally in a bay or river
 baptism isa kii maut, dafan-kriya tathaa punarutthan kaa samaran karaata he
 Baptism in itself does not fulfill anything, rather it is an outwardly personal sign or testimony that this person's sins have already been washed away by Jesus' cross
 ise ek anubandhatmak kaary mana jaataa he, jo isa ke nae samjhaute main pravesh kaa suchak he
 For most Baptists, Christian baptism is the act of subduing a believer in water in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
 yah ajnapaalan kaa ek kaary he, jo suuli par chadhaaye gayi, dafnaye gayi or punah jaagrit hue muktidaata main vishwaas karta kii shraddha, vishwasakarta ke paapon ke vinaash, puraane jivan ko dafnaye jane or jivan ke nayepan main isa messiah ke path kaa anusaran karte punarutthan kii ore sanket karata he
 This is the testimony of the believer in the final resurrection of the deceased
 adhikansh baptist vishwaas karte hai ki baptism apane aap main moksh athwa roopantaran nahin pradaan karata, balki yah us baat kaa sanket he, jo ek aadhyatmik arth main nav-vishwasakarta main pehle hi ho chuki he
 Since it is not believed to provide "protective grace" or salvation, Baptists consider it an "act" rather than a "sacrament"
 carch kaa ek "adhinium"-bible kii vah shiksha, jiskaa paalan isa messiah apane anuyaayiyon se karwaanaa chaahate the, hone ke kaaran yah carch kii sadsyta tathaa prabhu ke raatri-bhoj ko praapt karne kii purv-aavashyaktaa he
 Baptism cannot be separated from the person's view of Jesus because Jesus himself was baptized, and his immersion in baptism is portrayed as a new relationship in Christ, enjoyed by all believers
 baptiston kaa yah bhi vishwaas he ki baptism isa main kisi vyakti ke vishwaas ko sweekaar karne kaa ek mahatvapurn tarika bhi he
 Typically, adult, young, or older children who understand the commitment to faith in Christ and want to respond to God's call are acceptable candidates for baptism
 is baat ke liye baptiston kii aalochana kii jaati rahi he ki unke dwaara shishu baptism ko asweekaar kiya janaa yah darshata he ki ek vayask athwa vishwasakarta ke carch main bacchon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 Instead of baptizing young children and infants, Baptists hold a public church service that appeals to parents and church members to lead a life that exemplifies children, and to teach them the ways of the Lord, i give priority to dedicating children to God
 jal baptism us seva kaa ek bhaag nahin hota
 is aalochana kaa jawaab baptist yah kahkar dete hai ki ishwar kaa prem sabhi vyaktiyon tak, tathaa spasht rup se bacchon tak, failaa hua he; ki baptism swayan main ek sanskaar nahin he or isaliye iske dwaara vah moksh pradaan nahin kiya jaataa, jiske bare main aalochak maanate hai ki bachche isse vanchit hai; or chunki baptism keval vishwaas ko vyakt rup se sweekaar karne kaa ek bahya-sanket he, atah jab tak baptism lene vaala vyakti itnaa paripakv hona chaiye ki vah us sweekruti ke bare main ek suchit nirnay le sake

 However, members of the Church of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that sins are cleansed by the grace of God through the blood of Christ, baptism is not an inherently salvation ritual

" Catholics are baptized in water, immersed, immersed or immersed in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit — not in the name of three deities, but in the name of a God who is in three persons
 Although they share the same divine extract, the father, son and holy spirit are different, they are not three "masks" or avatars of any one divine personality

 The Church has identified two equivalent forms of baptism with water: "baptism of blood" and "baptism of will"
 Blood baptism is performed by baptized individuals who have sacrificed themselves for their faith, while baptism of will usually applies to newly converted converts studying Christianity who died before their baptism
 It has already happened
 The Catholic Church's religious teaching describes these two forms as follows: carch ne sadaiv hi drudh vishwaas rahaa he ki jin baptism-viheen logon kii mrityu baptism praapt kiye bina hi apane vishwaas kii raksha ke liye ho jaati he, kaa baptism unki mrityu ke dwaara tathaa isa ke saath hota he
 Baptism of blood, like baptism of will, provides the fruits of baptism even without any sacrament
 isai dharm kii shiksha le rahe aise nav-dharmantariton ke liye, jinaki mrityu apane baptism se purv hi ho jaae, apane paapon ke liye pashchaatap tathaa daan ke saath, ise praapt karne kii unki vyakt ichha, unhen us moksh kii prapti kaa aashwaasan detii he, jise ve is sanskaar ke dwaara praapt kar paane main sakasham nahin the
 The Catholic Church believes that non-christians who desire to receive God with a sincere heart and be inspired by his grace, walk according to the will of God, as they understand by their conscience
 They can also be saved without water baptism because it is said that this is their latent desire
 baptism-viheen shishuon ke liye, yah carch unke bhagya ke bare main anishchit he: "carch unhen keval ishwar kii krupa par hi chhod saktaa he" Baptism is also followed by Jehovah's Witnesses
 ve maanate hai ki ise purna nimajjan ke dwaara keval tabhi kiya janaa chaiye, jab vyakti iske mahatv ko samaj paane laayak bada ho gaya ho
 ve yah shiksha dete hai ki jal baptism is baat kaa ek vyakt sanket he ki vyakti ne isa messiah ke madhyam se genova ishwar kii ichha kaa paalan karne kaa ek purna, anarakshit tathaa bina shart samarpan kiya he; purushon tathaa mahilaon ke liye baptism milakar ek anushthan banataa he
 a candidate should request for baptism shortly before a planned baptism event, as preparation is required to qualify
 sambhav he ki dharmik sabha ke varisht-jan kisi ummidavaar ko keval tabhi sweekrut karen, jab vah is baat ko samaj letaa he ki genova ke gavaahon se jude kisi isai se kya apeksha kii jaati he tathaa vah is vishwaas ke prati sachcha samarpan pradarshit karata he
 At the end of a pre-baptism talk, before the actual baptism, it is necessary for the candidate to firmly accept the following points: vyavhaar main, genova ke gavaahon ke antargat adhikansh baptism varisht-janon tathaa adhikaar-praapt sevakon dwaara purv-nirdhaarit sabhaaon evam sammelnon main kiye jate hai, haalanki baptism dene vaale vyakti ke liye keval itnaa aavashyak hota he ki vah swayan ek baptism-dhari purush ho
 yadi ummidavaar shaareerik rup se viklang na ho athwa koi anya vishesh paristhiti utpann na ho jaye, to ek vishisht ummidavaar ko keval ek baptism-daata dwaara hi jal main duboya jaataa he

 Islam requires a type of washing called ghulul, which is similar to the Jewish method described above, which must include the washing of the whole body or immersing the whole body in a particular order, for example in a river

 Also, it is necessary to do this for dead bodies also
