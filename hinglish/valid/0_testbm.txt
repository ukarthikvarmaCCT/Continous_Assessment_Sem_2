 The Congress then started asking why agustawestland / Finnamica was made a part of Make in India despite objections? Why did the Modi government allow agustawestland and Tata's joint venture to make helicopters? Why agustawestland was allowed to bid for 100 Naval Utility Helicopters in April 2015? bijepi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisle se nai urja mili he ki iske zariye sonia gandhi ko bhrashtachar ke maamle main sidhe sidhe gheraa ja saktaa he
 Sonia Gandhi may be asking for proof but politics does not wait for proof
 sahi he ki faisle kii puri copy abhi tak nahin padhi gai he
 India's favor was not kept there but it is also a fact that bribe has been given in the agustawestland case
 dene kii baat sabit ho chuki he
 Except this question, the Congress is trying to surround the BJP through other questions
 sawaal to banate hai magar rishwat vaale sawaal ke jawaab ke rup main nahin
 The Congress says that chopper has been taken from Agusta in Chhattisgarh too
 sieji kii report ne kaha he ki 2007 main 65
 Documents for this purchase of US $ 7 million were prepared in such a way that no company other than agustawestland was involved in the procurement process
 yah baat congress abhi kyon kah rahi he
 Why did not you constantly lift
 tippaniyan Diwakar Anand of the 'DNA' newspaper wrote that on 10 February 2014, the Ministry of Defense started the process of blacklisting agustawestland and Finmanica
 inke saath hue saare qaraar par roak laga di thi
 On August 28, 2014, a new policy order comes in how to treat such a company
 is aadesh main likhaa tha ki koi kaaran nahin he ki finamaikanika group ke saath hue qaraar ke saath aage na badha jaae
 The same order stated that Finmacanica and allies would be excluded from the new tender
 nae tender se alag bhi rakhana he or puraane qaraar ko jari bhi rakhana he
 Is there a complete ban
 kya is sawaal kaa jawaab antim rup se mil gaya he
 The same thing appeared in 'times of India' on 11 February 2014
 kai jaankaar kah rahe hai ki finamaikanika ko blike list karnaa aasaan nahin he
 On April 3, Financial Express reported that the Indian government had allowed agustawestland to participate in the tender for 100 light utility helicopters
 shart he ki company ko kisi sthaneey vendor se saajheedaari kerani hogi
 If this is true, then where is the black list? netaa adhikari ke saath-saath yah baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki karodon rupee media manage karne ke liye bhi kharch kiye gaye
 Therefore, investigation is important not only for the Congress but also for the media
 koun koun patrkaar manage ho rahe the
 Rather, they were managing the government on behalf of the company
 aaj bhi rajya sabha main subramanyam swami kii baat ko lekar hangaamaa ho gaya
 His talk was dropped from the action but from what he heard, it seems that BJP is not going to leave the Congress on this issue
 lekin is kahasuni ke jawaab main jo kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kah gaye wo dilachasp he
 What does it mean that Naqvi has been the master of the school where the Congressmen are studying
 isaki vyakhya kai roopon main kii ja sakati he
 Do you know what they are saying that as Head Master we know a lot or what you do, we can do better than you
 sibiai bhi kah rahi he ki anaupchaarik rup se faisle kii copy mili he uskaa anuwaad kara rahe hai
 The Ministry of Defense is also getting the translation done
 raksha mantralay ne kaha he ki saat se aath din lag jaayenge anuwaad karaane main
 Think about how long it would take for a translation of 225 pages, then how long it would have taken to translate 90 thousand pages, if it had been done
 jiske bare main mujhe jaankaree nahin he
 The CBI has interrogated Tyagi Brothers in the meantime
 sabhi kaa 10-12 saal kaa bank ricard dekh liya he
 Air Marshal SP Tyagi has also been questioned before and the extradition directorate has said that it will be questioned again
 kaha jaataa he ki sibiai ko bhi pukhta saboot nahin mili hai ki inke paas paisa aayaa he yaa nahin
 SP Tyagi's brother Rajiv Tyagi says that from the tender of agustawestland till the deal was done, five Air Chiefs, four Defense Secretaries came and went
 do rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar aae or chale gaye
 Two defense ministers also came and went
 pranab mukherjee or e ke antni
 Why did SP Tyagi name only so many people? rajeev tyaagi puch rahe hai ki kya tamaam prakriya main air marshall es pi tyaagi hi the
 Not only this, there were two Prime Ministers during the deal
 atal bihari vaajapeyi or manmohan singh
 Rajiv Tyagi says that it was during the Vajpayee period that the flight height of the helicopter was reduced from 6000 meters to 4500 meters
 agasta se pehle ek or helicopter kaa chayan hua tha i si 225 yah keval 6000 meter tak hi ud saktaa tha
 At the time it was thought that such a helicopter would form a single company, so there is no question that the same company was deliberately called in the tender, so the PMO suggested that helicopters flying at low altitude could be considered
 raksha mantralay kii site par agasta westland se sambandhit jo jaankariyaan di gai hai usee se bataa rahaa hum
 It is there since Antony's time and this information is there in Parrikar's time
 raksha mantralay ke anusaar 19 november 2003 ke din pradhan sachiv ne pradhanmantri ke saath baithak kii
 At the same time, it was decided to increase the flight height to 4500
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki in badlaavon se kai companiyon ko tender main bhaag lene kaa mauka miltaa
 It is only after this that Augusta enters the process of the Westland deal
 uske saath teen or companiyaan hoti hai
 Two companies exit at the start of the process and two are left - Augusta and Cicrosky
 is deal main ek integrity claaj tha jiske anusaar koi bhi rishwat kaa maamla saamne aayega to na keval sauda radd hoga, balki jo paisa diya ja chukaa hoga use bhi zabt kar liya jayega
 The Sekrosky company refused to sign the class and dropped out of the process
 agasta westland ke saath qaraar hua
 The Government of India canceled the deal and confiscated the money as soon as the brokerage was revealed
 1567 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha, lekin isse zyada kii rakam company se bharat ne vasuul lee
 But these things do not reveal who took the bribe
 italy kii adaalat ne rishwat dene kii baat sabit kii he
 The Government of India has also accepted the bribe, only then the deal was canceled and the money was recovered
 sawaal he rishwat kisne lee
 This thing is neither known from there nor from here
 qatl hua he ye sabit ho gaya he magar qatl kiskaa hua he yahi pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If we see the record of the order, then the record of any government is not bad
 nateeja puuchhenge to ricard hi nahin milegaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been aggressive ever since this news appeared in the 'economic Times'
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki italy kii adaalat kaa faisla he
 This news has appeared in the media earlier, therefore it would not be right to accuse him of retaliation
 ye or baat he ki modi sarkaar se poocha ja rahaa he ki bharat main ho rahi jaanch kaa anjaam kab dekhne ko milegaa
 The Economic Times has written that Sinyora Gandhi's name appears four times in the judgment
 bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa ek patr jaanchakartaaon ko mila he jisase pataa chalata he ki is deal ke peeche cinyoraa gandhi mukhya shakti rahi hai
 Sinoyra in Italian means Smriti
 ek or bichauliye ne adaalat main congress netaa sonia gandhi kii tasviir kii pahchaan kii he
 Some of the middlemen have been pointing to some members of the Congress in confiscated notes
 naukarshahon or bhartiya vaayu sena ke adhikaron kii bhoomika ke bhi sanket milte hai
 Sonia Gandhi has said that there is no evidence
 ve kisi se nahin daratin
 What was the Modi government doing for two years
 buudhvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar kii suhasini haidar or josi joseph ne bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa intervyuu kiya he
 It has been arrested once
 isane hindu akhbaar ko bataaya he ki main sonia gandhi se kabhi nahin mila hum, na kisi hotel yaa kisi party main
 It is a matter of luck that i have not been found
 mila hota to kehete ki maine kuch charchaa kii he
 Neither i have called, nor emailed, nor written the letter, nor sent the message
 unka kisi memo main naam bhi nahin he
 The question is also right whether this deal could have been done without the top leaders of the Congress or without the top ministers of the UPA government
 rishwat di gai he to kisi ke ishaare par hi di gai hogi, lee gai hogi
 This thing will be revealed only when there is a thorough investigation
 wo bhi samay se
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel and Oscar Fernandes, MK Narayanan, who was the NSA during the UPA, is also named
 sonia gandhi se lekar ahamed patel ne tamaam aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 The BJP has said that at least Sonia Gandhi must respect the Italian court's decision
 congress ne bhi 10 sawaal puche hai
 There is another aspect in this case
 'hindu' akhbaar se isi james chrishchiyan mishael ne bolaa ki mujhe teen alag-alag sutron ne bataaya ki neuyark main bharat ke pradhanmantri or italy ke pradhanmantri ke bich chalate-chalate ek mulaakaat hui he
 In the Italian Marine case, the Prime Minister of India assured that he could help Italy if there was any evidence of the Gandhi family being implicated in the helicopter deal
 'hindu' akhbaar ne poocha ki kya saboot he ki meeting hui he
 Mitchell said that not only have they met, but the meeting lasted so long that the two had to change the time of their second meetings
 yah sab jab ho rahaa tha to rajdooton ne bataaya tha ki donon kii mulaakaat chal rahi he
 Mitchell asked the 'hindu' newspaper whether he had given in writing that the meeting did not take place
 is mulaakaat ke bare main 2 farvari 2016 kolkata se nikalne vaale akhbaar 'di telegraph' main is bare main khabar chhapi thi
 Mitchell wrote to the International Tribunal Court that the two Prime Ministers had met and the Prime Minister of India offered that the Marines would settle the dispute if some evidence was found about the Gandhi family
 antarrashtriya tribunel court main italy or bharat ke bich bharat main giraftaar do nausainikon kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 At the time the news was published that it is such a nonsense that even commenting is useless
 is baar bhi jab yah baat uthi to videsh mantralay ne apni yahi baat doharaai
 The Finance Minister also said that no such meeting has been held
 raajnneetik aarope to lag rahe hai
 The BJP has surrounded the Congress, but what will happen beyond politics? is maamle main jaanch kaa koi adhikrut states report to he nahin or na aisi koi report hoti he
 People want whoever is guilty is caught early
 kahin aisa na ho ki ishrat ke baad builder, bilderon kii thagi ke baad agasta, agasta ke baad kuch or maamla aa jaae or yah sab ek nura kushti banakar rah jaae
 Now there is a case of blacklisting agustawestland
 jaise hi e ke antni ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi blike list kar diya gaya tha, raksha mantri manohan parrikar ne chunauti de daali ki ki agar kiya he to dastauez dikhaaen
 Parrikar came to the media and told that the helicopter company was not banned at the time of AK Antony
 parrikar ke spashtikaran ke turant baad hi e ke antni blike list karne se neeche utar aae or prakriya shuru karne kii baat karne lage
 Look now prakriya shuru karne or bain karne main antar to he
 If AK Antony checked fast, it would not have happened
 tab congress bhi yah poochne lagi ki kyon agasta westland / finamakenika ko aapattiyon ke baavjood mek in india kaa hissaa banaaya gaya? kyon modi sarkaar ne agasta westland or tata ke joint venture ko helicopter banane kii manzuri di? kyon agasta westland ko 100 neval utility helicopter ke liye april 2015 main boli lagane di gai? The BJP has gained new energy from the decision of the Italian court that it can directly surround Sonia Gandhi in the corruption case
 sonia gandhi bhale saboot maang rahi hon lekin raajnneeti saboot kaa intazaar nahin karti
 It is true that the full copy of the judgment has not been read yet
 vahaan bharat kaa paksh nahin rakhaa gaya lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki agasta westland maamle main rishwat di gai he
 The matter of giving has been proved
 congress is sawaal ko chhod anya sawaalon ke zariye bijepi ko gherne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Questions are made but not as an answer to a bribe
 congress kaa kahana he ki chhattisgarh main bhi agasta se helicopter liya gaya he
 The CAG report stated that in 2007
 65
 70 lakh amareeki dollar kii is kharid ke liye dastauez is dhang se taiyaar kiye gaye taaki agasta westland ke alaava koi or company kharid prakriya main shaamil na ho paae
 Why is the Congress saying this now? lagaataar kyon nahin uthaai
 The comments 'diene' akhbaar ke deewakar anand ne likhaa he ki 10 farvari 2014 ko raksha mantralay ne agasta westland or finamaikanika ko blaclist kerani kii prakriya shuru kar di
 All the agreements with them were banned
 28 agast 2014 ko ek nai niti kaa aadesh aata he ki is tarah kii company ke saath kaisaa bartaav kiya jaae
 The order stated that there was no reason not to proceed with the agreement with finmanica Group
 usee aadesh main kaha gaya tha ki finamaikanika or sahyogiyon ko nae tender se alag rakhaa jayega
 Separate from the new tender and keep the old contract
 kya purna rup se pratibandh laga
 Is the answer to this question finally found? 11 farvari 2014 ke 'times aaf india' main yahi baat chhapi thi
 Many experts are saying that blacklisting Finmacanica is not easy
 3 april ko financial express main khabar chhapi he ki bharat sarkaar ne agasta westland ko 100 lite utility helicopter ke liye tender main bhaag lene kii anumati de di he
 The condition is that the company will have to partner with a local vendor
 agar ye baat sahi he to phir blike list kahaan hui
 Along with the leader officer, it is also coming to the fore that crores of rupees were spent to manage the media
 isliye sirf congress ke liye nahin media ke liye bhi jaanch zaruri he
 Who were managing journalists? balki company kii taraf se sarkaar ko hi manage kar rahe the
 Even today there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over Subramanian Swamy's talk
 unki baat ko karrwai se hataa to diya gaya lekin jo kaha suni hui usase lagata he ki is masale ko lekar bijepi congress ko chhodane vaali nahin he
 But what Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in response to this saying is interesting
 is baat kaa kya matlab he ki congress vaale jis skool main padhe hai uske nakvi ji master rahe hai
 This can be interpreted in many ways
 kya pataa wo yah kah rahe hai ki head master hone ke naate ham khub jaanate hai yaa jo aap karte hai wo ham aapse behatar kar sakate hai
 Air Marshal SP Tyagi has also been questioned before and the extradition directorate has said that it will be questioned again

 kya pataa wo yah kah rahe hai ki head master hone ke naate ham khub jaanate hai yaa jo aap karte hai wo ham aapse behatar kar sakate hai
 There was an Integrity Clause in this deal, according to which any bribery case will come up, not only will the deal be canceled, but the money that has been paid will also be confiscated
 sikroski company ne is claaj par sin karne se manaa kar diya or wo is prakriya se baahar ho gai
 Agreed with agustawestland
 dallali kii baat saamne aate hi bharat sarkaar ne sauda radd kar diya or paisa bhi zabt kar liya
 Rs 1567 crore was paid, but more than this was recovered by India from the company
 magar in baton se yah nahin pataa chalata ki kisne rishwat lee
 The Italian court has proved the bribe
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi rishwat diye jane kii baat maani he tabhi to sauda radd kiya gaya or paisa vasula gaya
 The question is who took the bribe
 yah baat na vahaan se pataa chalati he na yahaan se
 It has been proved that the murder has happened, but whose murder is not known
 aadesh kaa ricard dekhenge to kisi bhi sarkaar kaa ricard karaab nahin he
 If you ask the result, you will not get a record
 jab se yah khabar 'iconomik times' main chhapi he tab se bhartiya janata party aakraamak he
 The BJP says that the Italian court has decided
 media main yah khabar pehle chhapi he isliye us par badale kii karrwai kaa aarope lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 It is another matter that the Modi government is being asked when the outcome of the investigation going on in India will be seen
 'iconomik times' ne likhaa he ki faisle main cinyoraa gandhi kaa naam chaar baar aayaa he
 Investigators have received a letter from middleman Christian Mitchell, indicating that Sinora Gandhi was the main force behind the deal
 italian main cinyoraa kaa matlab shrimati hota he
 Another middleman has identified the picture of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi in the court
 kai saare bichauliyon se zabt note main congress ke kuch sadasyon kii taraf ishaara ho rahaa he
 There are also indications of the role of bureaucrats and the rights of the Indian Air Force
 sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki koi saboot nahin he
 She is not afraid of anyone
 modi sarkaar do saal se kya kar rahi thi
 On Wednesday, Suhasini Haider and Josie Joseph of 'hindu' newspaper interviewed middleman Christian Mitchell
 yah ek baar giraftaar ho chukaa he
 It has told the Hindu newspaper that i have never met Sonia Gandhi, nor in any hotel or any party
 bhagya kii baat he ki nahin mila hum
 If i had met, i would have said that i have discussed something
 na maine phone kiya he, na email kiya he, na letters likhaa he, na massej kiya he
 He is not even named in any memo
 yah sawaal vaazib bhi he ki kya congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bina yaa upie sarkaar ke sheersh mantriyon ke bina yah deal ho sakati thi
 If a bribe has been given, it would have been given at the behest of someone, it would have been taken
 yah baat tabhi saamne aegi jab isaki pukhta jaanch hogi
 From that time too
 manmohan singh, ahamed patel or auskar furnandis ke alaava upie ke vakt enese rahe emke narayanan kaa bhi naam he
 From Sonia Gandhi to Ahmed Patel, all the allegations have been denied
 bijepi ne kaha he ki kam se kam sonia gandhi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisale kaa sammaan to karnaa hi chahie
 Congress has also asked 10 questions
 is maamle main ek or pahalu he
 The same James Christian Mitchell told the 'hindu' newspaper that three different sources told me that there was a meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Italy in New York
 italian marine cese maamle main bharat ke pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan diya ki ve italy kii madad kar sakate hai agar helicopter saude main gandhi parivaar ko fansaane kaa koi saboot mil jaae to
 The Hindu newspaper asked if there was any evidence that the meeting had taken place
 mishael ne kaha ki na sirf mulaakaat hui he, balki itani der chal mulaakaat chali ki donon ko apni duusari baithkon ke samay main badlaav karnaa padaa tha
 When all this was happening, the ambassadors had told that the two were meeting
 mishael ne 'hindu' akhbaar se poocha ki kya unhone likhit rup main diya he ki mulaakaat nahin
 The news about this meeting was published in the newspaper 'the Telegraph' originating from Kolkata on 2 February 2016
 mishael ne antarrashtriya tribunel court ko likhaa tha ki donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich mulaakaat hui he or bharat ke pradhanmantri ne peshkash kii he ki agar gandhi parivaar ke bare main kuch saboot mil jaae to marine vivaad ko sulajhaa denge
 The case of two marines arrested in Italy is going on between Italy and India in the International Tribunal Court
 jis vakt khabar chhapi thi ki ye itani bakawaas baat he ki coment karnaa bhi bekaar he
 This time also when this matter arose, the Ministry of External Affairs repeated the same thing
 sadan main vitt mantri ne bhi kaha ki aisi koi mulaakaat nahin hui he
 Political allegations are being made
 bijepi ne congress ko gher to liya he lekin kya baat raajnneeti se bhi aage badhegi
 In this case, there is no official status report of inquiry and there is no such report
 log chaahate hai ki jo bhi doshi he wo jaldi pakadaa jaae
 It should not happen that after Ishrat, the builder, after the cheating of the builders, Augusta, after Augusta, some other issue will come and it all becomes a nura wrestling
 ab ek maamla he agasta westland ko blike list karne kaa
 As soon as AK Antony said that he was blacklisted during his tenure, Defense Minister Manohan Parrikar challenged that the documents be shown if done
 parrikar media ke saamne aae or bataa diya ki e ke antni ke samay helicopter company ko bain nahin kiya gaya tha
 Soon after Parrikar's clarification, AK Antony came down from the black list and started talking about starting the process
 ab dekhiye
 There is a difference between starting and banning the process
 e ke antni agar tezi se se jaanch karte to ye naubat nahin aati
 The Congress then started asking why agustawestland / Finnamica was made a part of Make in India despite objections? Why did the Modi government allow agustawestland and Tata's joint venture to make helicopters? Why agustawestland was allowed to bid for 100 Naval Utility Helicopters in April 2015? bijepi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisle se nai urja mili he ki iske zariye sonia gandhi ko bhrashtachar ke maamle main sidhe sidhe gheraa ja saktaa he
 Sonia Gandhi may be asking for proof but politics does not wait for proof
 sahi he ki faisle kii puri copy abhi tak nahin padhi gai he
 India's favor was not kept there but it is also a fact that bribe has been given in the agustawestland case
 dene kii baat sabit ho chuki he
 Except this question, the Congress is trying to surround the BJP through other questions
 sawaal to banate hai magar rishwat vaale sawaal ke jawaab ke rup main nahin
 The Congress says that chopper has been taken from Agusta in Chhattisgarh too
 sieji kii report ne kaha he ki 2007 main 65
 Documents for this purchase of US $ 7 million were prepared in such a way that no company other than agustawestland was involved in the procurement process
 yah baat congress abhi kyon kah rahi he
 Why did not you constantly lift
 tippaniyan Diwakar Anand of the 'DNA' newspaper wrote that on 10 February 2014, the Ministry of Defense started the process of blacklisting agustawestland and Finmanica
 inke saath hue saare qaraar par roak laga di thi
 On August 28, 2014, a new policy order comes in how to treat such a company
 is aadesh main likhaa tha ki koi kaaran nahin he ki finamaikanika group ke saath hue qaraar ke saath aage na badha jaae
 The same order stated that Finmacanica and allies would be excluded from the new tender
 nae tender se alag bhi rakhana he or puraane qaraar ko jari bhi rakhana he
 Is there a complete ban
 kya is sawaal kaa jawaab antim rup se mil gaya he
 The same thing appeared in 'times of India' on 11 February 2014
 kai jaankaar kah rahe hai ki finamaikanika ko blike list karnaa aasaan nahin he
 On April 3, Financial Express reported that the Indian government had allowed agustawestland to participate in the tender for 100 light utility helicopters
 shart he ki company ko kisi sthaneey vendor se saajheedaari kerani hogi
 If this is true, then where is the black list? netaa adhikari ke saath-saath yah baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki karodon rupee media manage karne ke liye bhi kharch kiye gaye
 Therefore, investigation is important not only for the Congress but also for the media
 koun koun patrkaar manage ho rahe the
 Rather, they were managing the government on behalf of the company
 aaj bhi rajya sabha main subramanyam swami kii baat ko lekar hangaamaa ho gaya
 His talk was dropped from the action but from what he heard, it seems that BJP is not going to leave the Congress on this issue
 lekin is kahasuni ke jawaab main jo kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kah gaye wo dilachasp he
 What does it mean that Naqvi has been the master of the school where the Congressmen are studying
 isaki vyakhya kai roopon main kii ja sakati he
 Do you know what they are saying that as Head Master we know a lot or what you do, we can do better than you
 jab se yah khabar 'iconomik times' main chhapi he tab se bhartiya janata party aakraamak he
 The BJP says that the Italian court has decided
 media main yah khabar pehle chhapi he isliye us par badale kii karrwai kaa aarope lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 It is another matter that the Modi government is being asked when the outcome of the investigation going on in India will be seen
 'iconomik times' ne likhaa he ki faisle main cinyoraa gandhi kaa naam chaar baar aayaa he
 Investigators have received a letter from middleman Christian Mitchell, indicating that Sinora Gandhi was the main force behind the deal
 italian main cinyoraa kaa matlab shrimati hota he
 Another middleman has identified the picture of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi in the court
 kai saare bichauliyon se zabt note main congress ke kuch sadasyon kii taraf ishaara ho rahaa he
 There are also indications of the role of bureaucrats and the rights of the Indian Air Force
 sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki koi saboot nahin he
 She is not afraid of anyone
 modi sarkaar do saal se kya kar rahi thi
 On Wednesday, Suhasini Haider and Josie Joseph of 'hindu' newspaper interviewed middleman Christian Mitchell
 yah ek baar giraftaar ho chukaa he
 It has told the Hindu newspaper that i have never met Sonia Gandhi, nor in any hotel or any party
 bhagya kii baat he ki nahin mila hum
 If i had met, i would have said that i have discussed something
 na maine phone kiya he, na email kiya he, na letters likhaa he, na massej kiya he
 He is not even named in any memo
 yah sawaal vaazib bhi he ki kya congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bina yaa upie sarkaar ke sheersh mantriyon ke bina yah deal ho sakati thi
 If a bribe has been given, it would have been given at the behest of someone, it would have been taken
 yah baat tabhi saamne aegi jab isaki pukhta jaanch hogi
 From that time too
 manmohan singh, ahamed patel or auskar furnandis ke alaava upie ke vakt enese rahe emke narayanan kaa bhi naam he
 From Sonia Gandhi to Ahmed Patel, all the allegations have been denied
 bijepi ne kaha he ki kam se kam sonia gandhi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisale kaa sammaan to karnaa hi chahie
 Congress has also asked 10 questions

 Do you know what they are saying that as Head Master we know a lot or what you do, we can do better than you
 buudhvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar kii suhasini haidar or josi joseph ne bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa intervyuu kiya he
 It has been arrested once
 isane hindu akhbaar ko bataaya he ki main sonia gandhi se kabhi nahin mila hum, na kisi hotel yaa kisi party main
 It is a matter of luck that i have not been found
 mila hota to kehete ki maine kuch charchaa kii he
 Neither i have called, nor emailed, nor written the letter, nor sent the message
 unka kisi memo main naam bhi nahin he
 The question is also right whether this deal could have been done without the top leaders of the Congress or without the top ministers of the UPA government
 rishwat di gai he to kisi ke ishaare par hi di gai hogi, lee gai hogi
 This thing will be revealed only when there is a thorough investigation
 wo bhi samay se
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel and Oscar Fernandes, MK Narayanan, who was the NSA during the UPA, is also named
 sonia gandhi se lekar ahamed patel ne tamaam aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 The BJP has said that at least Sonia Gandhi must respect the Italian court's decision
 congress ne bhi 10 sawaal puche hai
 There is another aspect in this case
 'hindu' akhbaar se isi james chrishchiyan mishael ne bolaa ki mujhe teen alag-alag sutron ne bataaya ki neuyark main bharat ke pradhanmantri or italy ke pradhanmantri ke bich chalate-chalate ek mulaakaat hui he
 In the Italian Marine case, the Prime Minister of India assured that he could help Italy if there was any evidence of the Gandhi family being implicated in the helicopter deal
 'hindu' akhbaar ne poocha ki kya saboot he ki meeting hui he
 Mitchell said that not only have they met, but the meeting lasted so long that the two had to change the time of their second meetings
 yah sab jab ho rahaa tha to rajdooton ne bataaya tha ki donon kii mulaakaat chal rahi he
 Mitchell asked the 'hindu' newspaper whether he had given in writing that the meeting did not take place
 is mulaakaat ke bare main 2 farvari 2016 kolkata se nikalne vaale akhbaar 'di telegraph' main is bare main khabar chhapi thi
 Mitchell wrote to the International Tribunal Court that the two Prime Ministers had met and the Prime Minister of India offered that the Marines would settle the dispute if some evidence was found about the Gandhi family
 antarrashtriya tribunel court main italy or bharat ke bich bharat main giraftaar do nausainikon kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 At the time the news was published that it is such a nonsense that even commenting is useless
 is baar bhi jab yah baat uthi to videsh mantralay ne apni yahi baat doharaai
 The Finance Minister also said that no such meeting has been held
 raajnneetik aarope to lag rahe hai
 The BJP has surrounded the Congress, but what will happen beyond politics? is maamle main jaanch kaa koi adhikrut states report to he nahin or na aisi koi report hoti he
 People want whoever is guilty is caught early
 kahin aisa na ho ki ishrat ke baad builder, bilderon kii thagi ke baad agasta, agasta ke baad kuch or maamla aa jaae or yah sab ek nura kushti banakar rah jaae
 Now there is a case of blacklisting agustawestland
 jaise hi e ke antni ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi blike list kar diya gaya tha, raksha mantri manohan parrikar ne chunauti de daali ki ki agar kiya he to dastauez dikhaaen
 Parrikar came to the media and told that the helicopter company was not banned at the time of AK Antony
 parrikar ke spashtikaran ke turant baad hi e ke antni blike list karne se neeche utar aae or prakriya shuru karne kii baat karne lage
 Look now prakriya shuru karne or bain karne main antar to he
 If AK Antony checked fast, it would not have happened
 tab congress bhi yah poochne lagi ki kyon agasta westland / finamakenika ko aapattiyon ke baavjood mek in india kaa hissaa banaaya gaya? kyon modi sarkaar ne agasta westland or tata ke joint venture ko helicopter banane kii manzuri di? kyon agasta westland ko 100 neval utility helicopter ke liye april 2015 main boli lagane di gai? The BJP has gained new energy from the decision of the Italian court that it can directly surround Sonia Gandhi in the corruption case
 sonia gandhi bhale saboot maang rahi hon lekin raajnneeti saboot kaa intazaar nahin karti
 It is true that the full copy of the judgment has not been read yet
 vahaan bharat kaa paksh nahin rakhaa gaya lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki agasta westland maamle main rishwat di gai he
 The matter of giving has been proved
 congress is sawaal ko chhod anya sawaalon ke zariye bijepi ko gherne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Questions are made but not as an answer to a bribe
 congress kaa kahana he ki chhattisgarh main bhi agasta se helicopter liya gaya he
 The CAG report stated that in 2007
 65
 70 lakh amareeki dollar kii is kharid ke liye dastauez is dhang se taiyaar kiye gaye taaki agasta westland ke alaava koi or company kharid prakriya main shaamil na ho paae
 Why is the Congress saying this now? lagaataar kyon nahin uthaai
 The comments 'diene' akhbaar ke deewakar anand ne likhaa he ki 10 farvari 2014 ko raksha mantralay ne agasta westland or finamaikanika ko blaclist kerani kii prakriya shuru kar di
 All the agreements with them were banned
 28 agast 2014 ko ek nai niti kaa aadesh aata he ki is tarah kii company ke saath kaisaa bartaav kiya jaae
 The order stated that there was no reason not to proceed with the agreement with finmanica Group
 usee aadesh main kaha gaya tha ki finamaikanika or sahyogiyon ko nae tender se alag rakhaa jayega
 Separate from the new tender and keep the old contract
 kya purna rup se pratibandh laga
 Is the answer to this question finally found? 11 farvari 2014 ke 'times aaf india' main yahi baat chhapi thi
 Many experts are saying that blacklisting Finmacanica is not easy
 3 april ko financial express main khabar chhapi he ki bharat sarkaar ne agasta westland ko 100 lite utility helicopter ke liye tender main bhaag lene kii anumati de di he
 The condition is that the company will have to partner with a local vendor
 agar ye baat sahi he to phir blike list kahaan hui
 Along with the leader officer, it is also coming to the fore that crores of rupees were spent to manage the media
 isliye sirf congress ke liye nahin media ke liye bhi jaanch zaruri he
 Who were managing journalists? balki company kii taraf se sarkaar ko hi manage kar rahe the
 Even today there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over Subramanian Swamy's talk
 unki baat ko karrwai se hataa to diya gaya lekin jo kaha suni hui usase lagata he ki is masale ko lekar bijepi congress ko chhodane vaali nahin he
 But what Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in response to this saying is interesting
 is baat kaa kya matlab he ki congress vaale jis skool main padhe hai uske nakvi ji master rahe hai
 This can be interpreted in many ways
 kya pataa wo yah kah rahe hai ki head master hone ke naate ham khub jaanate hai yaa jo aap karte hai wo ham aapse behatar kar sakate hai
 The question is also right whether this deal could have been done without the top leaders of the Congress or without the top ministers of the UPA government
 rishwat di gai he to kisi ke ishaare par hi di gai hogi, lee gai hogi

 India is going on between Italy and India in the International Tribunal Court

 The problem is that the entire campaign of the Congress in the upcoming assembly elections and subsequent Lok Sabha elections will be based on the government's 'achievements'

 Even those who handle the election campaign in the Congress should ignore it, but it is true that the dilemma of the government versus the party has increased
 agar congress apane prachaar ko sarkaar ke ird-gird khadaa karti he, to iske paas aisa kuch bhi nahin he, jis par vah naaj kar sake
 If she prepares this campaign around the new team, it indirectly points to Manmohan Singh's failure

 At the moment, the Congress is displaying bravery

 This only reinforced his image of a directionless leader

 Rahul, who confined himself to the role of just one manager, once again failed to leave his personal mark on the new team of Congress, while keeping the election in mind it was expected that this would be the biggest reshuffle for the party
 yah ab bhi bahut kuch sonia gandhi kii hi team lagati he
 Due to the half-incompleteness of this whole exercise, the discussion is going on that it is probably not the final team

 Despite searching for talented leaders within the party to promote young leaders since 2009, Rahul failed to bring a single leader from his youth brigade to the top level in the organization or cabinet

 The message for the government was clear — it was a gathering of useless people, who used to fill their quota mines, but were useless from the perspective of functioning
 party ke liye bhi sandesh spasht tha—rahul kii najar bhavishya par to he, lekin chunaav kareeb hone ke baavjood ve jaldi main nahin hai
 Says a senior Congress leader, "rahul does not want any major reshuffle in the existing party system, but hopes to make a concrete choice for the future
" ” rahul ke asamanjas kaa majbootee se bachaav karte hue congress ke is netaa kaa kahana he ki rahul kii kaaryastylee kaaphi sust he

 But one party MP complains, "he is reliable, but he has not been tested yet

 After the formation of the new team, Rahul was ready with his plan at 9 am on June 17
