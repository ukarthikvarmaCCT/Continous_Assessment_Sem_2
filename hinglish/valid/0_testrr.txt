 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 It is a meaningful thing that in the life of quaid-e-azam, Mater Millat his Hummer Uh should live effectively for 19 years i
e
 from 1929 to 1948 and death remained the same time after Friday i
e
 from 1946 to 1967 but in this second phase his own Individuals emerged in such a way and their ideas and roles came out in such a way that they were able to play the life of quaid-e-azam's democratic 'unshakeable and transparent political values
 Credit can be given that had forgotten ruler
 is silsile main maadar millat ne jin aara jataai unase samakaleen raajnneetishastra or maamalon par unki zahani pakad naa yogya vishwaas had tak or majboot najar aati he
 In response to the criticism of Job Khan on the occasion of the Presidential election of 1965, Mather Milat himself said that Job can be an expert in military affairs, but political understanding and i have got quaid-e-azam directly and this is an area in which Amar absolutely no longitude is
 1965 ke baad utpann hone vaali ghatnaon madarmalat ke is bayaan kii pushti karne ke liye kaaphi hai
 Some of the dangers identified repeatedly by Mather Miltat, for example, are: madarmalat ne noi anya rashtriya or antarrashtriya maamalon ke barse main sahebaan satta or janata koane vaale khataron se aagaah karne vaale jo vivaran die vah unki dur ras nigahon or raajnneetik doordarshee kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 If we would have listened to Ni Maadar Milat's vision and organized to avoid the dangers that were clearly watching, we would not have been in the grip of radical political, economic and social outlays that would make our nation night and The day is facing up and it seems certain that the Dalkhrash incident site of East Pakistan would not have been developing
 maadar millat raajnneetik jivan chaahe unhone jis andaaz se raat or din bitaye or raashtra or musalamaanon ke liye jo balidaan karen unke andar nishchay ek adarsh bhoomika ke puure karkon hai
 Five of these factors are particularly notable: First: she was an ideal Garillo woman

 This was the satisfying and peaceful Indigenous atmosphere in which, despite his illness, quaid-e-azam was able to achieve the full success and movement of Pakistan with a needle
 do: maadar millat jivan se ek mahatvapurn sabak yah miltaa he ki mahilaon ko pro feshnal shiksha aa rasta honachahe taaki vah aarthik rup se aatmanirbhar hai or rashtriya aay main bhi vruddhi kar saken
 Mather Millat received a crush on the dentist and spent many years working on it and giving free treatment to the poor during this period

 Fourth: The most important achievement of Madar Miltat is to make Pakistan walk on the path of democracy
 She participated in the 1965 presidential election by refreshing memories of the movement Pakistan's public substance and the feelings of a juggling and passion between East and West Pakistan
 Made aware haalanki unhen dhaandhlee se haraaya gaya lekin iskaa nateeja kuch saalon ke andar ayyub khan kii sainya shaasha ke ant ke rup main niklaa
 The message for the women of Pakistan in the political struggle is that it should not be related to political science

 It is the duty of women and especially girls to study the hyatt and services of the dear sister of quaid-e-azam and inculcate within them at least the qualities mentioned above
 inhen visheshtaon kii badaulat mahilaon raashtra vikaas or nirmaan main bharpoor andaaz main yogadan kar sakati hai

 So in order to make ourselves a strong and truly powerful nation, it is very important that Pakistan should not be caught in the grip of such enemy activities
 In this context, our first duty of Kashmir becomes

 Himmler's principal father entrusted him with the task of spying on other students and punishing them
 Even his father used to call him a born criminal
 athletics main unhen bahut haath-paanv maarna padataa tha, lekin ve skool kii padhai-likhaai main achche rahe
 Also, at the behest of his father, Himmler kept a diary from age 10 to age 24
 He was fond of chess, harpsichord, stamp collecting and gardening
 apane yuvavastha se lekar vayask hone ke puure daur main himalar mahilaon ke saath sambandhon main kabhi bhi sahajabhaav nahin rakh paye
 Himmler's diaries suggest that he was highly interested in war-related news
 unhone apane pita se vinati kii ki apane shahi samparkon kaa upyog karke ve unhen ek adhikari ummidavaar kaa pad dilava den
 His parents eventually agreed and allowed him to undergo training from the 11th Bavarian Regiment
 chunki ve ek athlettic nahin the, isliye unhen apane sainya prashikshan ke dauraan kaaphi sangharsh karnaa padaa
 germany kii haar ke saath 1918 main yuddh samaapt hua or is prakaar ek peshewar sena adhikari banane kii himalar kii aakankshaon kaa bhi ant ho gaya
 From 1919 to 1922 Himmler studied agricultural science at Munich Technisk Hokshul, after which he fell ill after training in a farm for a few days
 apni diary main unhone ek dharmanishth roman catholic hone kaa daawa kiya he or likhaa he ki ve roman carch ko kabhi bhi chhod nahin sakate
 haalanki, ve ek birdari ke ek sadsy the or baad main thule sosayadi main bhi shaamil hue or yah mahasoos karte rahe ki unke ye donon sambandh carch ke siddhanton ke saath mail nahin khate
 jeevani lekhakon ne himalar ke dharamshastra ko ariosophy ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he, unka apana arya nasleey shreshthata or germanik meso-paganism kaa dharmik mataagrah bataaya, jo uttari europe ke lokgeeton tathaa pracheen tutonic janajatiyon kii puranic kathaon kii unki apni vyakhya se aanshik rup se viksit hua
 During this, he once again became obsessed with becoming a soldier
 unhone likhaa tha ki agar jald hi germany yuddh main nahin utarataa he, to ve yuddh kii guhaar lagane ke liye kisi duusare desh chale jaaenge
 In 1923, Himmler participated in the Beer Hall Rebellion of Adolf Hitler under Ernst Röhm
 1926 main ek toofaan se bachane ke samay ek hotel kii lobby main unki mulaaqaat apni bhavi patni se hui
 Margaret Seagrowth was seven years her senior, divorced and Protestant

 During this time Himmler was doing poultry farming with failure
 8 agast 1929 ko unka iklaute bachche gurdrun kaa janm hua
 Himmler loves his daughter very much and calls her Puppy English: "dolly"
 Margaret later adopted a son, towards whom Himmler showed no interest
 Heinrich and Margaret Himmler separated in 1940 without a divorce

 Who quit her job in 1941 and became her Smt
 usase ve do bacchon ke pita bane - ek putr helge or ek putree nanete dorothea

 unka or unki patni kaa ek krishi jivan bitaane kaa romantic adarsh tha
 He joined the Artamanen society, a kind of idealistic back-to-the-land youth group, but also influenced by racist thought

 Through this movement he met Rudolf Hobb, who later presided over Ausquitz; He was also met by Richard Walther Pass, who later worked in ss's Rusha
 1925 main himalar eses main shaamil hue, bavaria main unka pehla padasthaapan eses-gaufyuharer ke rup main hua
 In 1927, he became Deputy reichführer-ss, received the rank of ss-oberführer and Himmler was appointed reichführer-ss in 1929 following the resignation of SS Commander Erhard Hayden
 us samay, eses ke 280 sadsy the or bahut bade sturmabteilung kaa mahaj ek kuleen batalian bhar tha
 The following year, Himmler began a major expansion in the organization and in 1930, he was promoted to ss-gruppenführer
 1933 tak, eses ke 52,000 sadsy ho gayi
 The organization enforced strict membership and ensured that all members belonged to Hitler's Aryan Herrenvolk
 Himmler and his colleague Reinhard Hedrick began an effort to get the SS out of sa's control
 july 1932 main ese kii bhuri kameez kii jagah kaali eses vardi banane lagi or 1934 tak sabhi ke saamaanya upyog ke liye paryaapt vardi taiyaar ho gayi
 In 1933, Himmler was promoted to ss-obergruppenführer
 isse ve varisht ese commander ke samakaksh ho gayi, jo ab eses se nafrat karne laga tha or isaki shakti se irshyaa karata tha
 Himmler, Hermann Göring and General Werner von Blomberg agreed that the SA and its leader Ernst Röhm were posing a threat to the German army and the Nazi
 roham samaajawaadee or lokwaadi vichaaron ke the or unka maananaa tha ki asli kranti abhi tak shuru nahin hui he
 He felt that the SA should be the only armed forces in the country
 is kaaran kuch naji, sainya or raajnneetik netaaon ko laga ki roham ese ke istemaal se takhtapalat karnaa chaahate hai
 At the instigation of Himmler and Göring, Hitler agreed to eliminate Rohm
 unhone yah kaam reinhard hedrick, kurt daluege or warner best ko saunpa, jinhone roham sahit anya varisht adhikariyon ke khatme ke aadesh die; saath hi hitler ke kuch nijee shatruon ko bhi khatm karne kaa aadesh diya gaya, ye kaam 30 june 1934 ko kiye gayi, jo nit of da laung nife ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The next day, the SS became an independent organization, only accountable to Hitler, and Himmler's title of reichführer-ss became the formal highest rank of the SS
 20 april 1934 ko, goring ne himalar or hedrick ke saath ek saajhedaari banaayi
 Göring transferred the authority of the Gestapo, a Prussian espionage organization, to Himmler, who was also made the head of the German police outside Prussia
 22 april 1934 ko, himalar ne hedrick ko gestapo kaa pramukh niyukt kiya
 Hedrick also continued to head SD
 17 june 1936 ko, hitler dwaara "rikh ke police niyantran ke ekikaran" karne ke nirnay kii ghoshnaa ke baad himalar ko german police kaa pramukh bana diya gaya
 Traditionally, law enforcement in Germany was a state-level and local matter
 is bhoomika main, himalar nammaatr ke liye aantarik mantri wilhem frick ke adhinsth hue
 haalanki, ajyapti se police kaa prabhavi dhang se eses main vilay ho gaya, isse yah frick ke niyantran se lagbhag swatantra ho gaya
 Himmler gained strength as all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies merged into a new Ordnungspolizei, the headquarters of this new institution becoming a headquarters branch of the SS
 apane khitaab ke baavjood, himalar ko vardidhari police kaa sirf aanshik niyantran hi praapt hua
 He was given some real powers previously exercised by the Ministry of the Interior
 1943 main, jab himalar ko aantarik mantri niyukt kiya gaya, tab jaakar mantri satta kaa hastantaran puraa hua
 With the 1936 appointment, Himmler was assigned the ministerial authority of Germany's non-political spy forces, the criminalpolicy, which he merged with the Gestapo in Schircherheitspolize, thus gaining operational control over Germany's entire espionage force
 yah vilay kabhi bhi rikh ke bheetar puraa nahin hua, kripo mukhya rup se apane naagarik prashasan ke niyantran main hi rahaa or baad main party upkaran bana 
 haalanki, adhikrut ilaake vaastavik rikh main shaamil nahin kiye gayi the, lekin eses ke cmand line ke andar sipo kaa ekikaran zyaadaatar prabhavi sabit hua
 On September 1939, after the start of the Second War, Himmler formed the Reichsssikerheitscheuptmatt, where Sipo and Schircherheitsdienst became departments under Hedrick's command
 himalar puure yatnaa shivi kii pranali kaa nirikshan kiya karte
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke ek baar shuru ho jane ke baad, aupchaarik rup se yatnaa shivi ke rup main vargeekrut nahin kiye jane vaale nae najarbandi shiviron kii sthapana kii gayi thi, in par himalar or eses kaa niyantran nahin tha
 In 1943, after the outbreak of criticism of popular verbal criticism of the regime as a result of the Stalingrad catastrophe, the party expressed disappointment at the Gestapo's failure to curb these criticisms, establishing its political police organ in the form of the Politische Stäffelen
 The Gestapo's monopoly in the region was severed
 in varshon ke dauraan eses ne apni sainya shakha eses-verphugungstruppe ko viksit kiya, jo baad main wafphen-eses main viksit hua
 Despite being subordinated to Himmler for the name, the waffen-ss was completely molded into a military structure and developed to be involved in a parallel war effort with the Wehrmacht
 kai samakaleen tippaneekar wafphen-eses ko ek sammanjanak sainya sanghathan ke rup main manyata dene se inkaar karte rahe
 Its units were involved in the notorious incidents of killing civilians and unarmed prisoners
 yah bhi anek main se ek kaaran tha ki antarrashtriya sainya tribunel ne eses ko ek apradhi sanghathan ghoshit kiya
 After the Night of the Knives, the ss-tottenkopfverbande established and administered the German concentration camps, after 1941, also built the genocide camps in Poland
 apni khufia shakha suraksha seva ke madhyam se eses ne yahudiyon, jipsiyon, communiston or duusare saanskrithik, nasleey, raajnneetik yaa dharmik vyaktiyon ko jinhen naji yaa to antarmensch yaa shashan virdohi maanate, yatnaa shiviron main daalana shuru kiya
 On 22 March 1933 Himmler started the first such camp in Dachau
 ve vidhwans ke mukhya roopakar the, lakhon-lakh logon kii hatya kaa auchity sabit karne ke liye ve rahasyavaad ke tatwon or naslvaadi naji siddhant ke prati ek kattar vishwaas kaa istemaal kiya karte
 polandvasiyon ke liye bhi himalar kii aisi hi yojana thi; buddhijiviyon ko maar daalana tha or unka vishwaas tha ki anya polandwasi mahaj trephic signal samajhane laayak hi padhe-likhe hai
 Himmler's booklet shows that Himmler met Hitler on 18 December 1941
 us din ke indraj main yah sawaal khada kiya gaya tha "rus ke yahudiyon ke saath kya kiya jaay?" or uske baad prashn kaa uttar tha "alls partisanen osjuroton" 
 Instead of Hitler, Himmler would inspect the concentration camps
 As a result of these inspections, the Nazis discovered a new and even more expedient method of murder, which led to the use of gas chambers
 himalar germany main nordic aaryon kaa ek shaasha nasl chaahate the
 As a henchman farmer, he had learned from his experience the basic elements of animal breeding which he wanted to instill on mankind
 unka maananaa tha ki ve utkrisht santanotpatti vidya se chaynaatmak prajnan ke jariye german aabaadi ko badal sakate hai, jo yuddh ke anek dashak baad puri tarah se "nordic" ban jaaenge
 On 4 October 1943, Himmler explicitly mentioned the extermination of the Jewish public at a secret meeting of the SS in the city of Poznaान
 bhaashan ke ek audio recording ke lipyantaran kaa ek ansh nimnlikhit he: i am now referring to the evacuation of the suspecting, to the extermination of the Jewish People
 This is something that is easily said: 'the Jewish people will be exterminated', says every party member, 'this is very obvious, it is in our program - elimination of the arguments, extermination, a small matter
' And then they turn up, the upstanding 80 million Germans, and each one has his decent jew
 They say the others are all swine, but this particular one is a splendid jew
 But none has observed it, endured it
 Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000
 To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person - with exceptions due to human weaknesses - has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of
 Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had believed as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war
 If the claims were still part of the German nation, we would most likely arrive now at the state we were at in 1916 and '17
 
 
 
 —heinrich Himmler, 4 oktober 1943 Bricha Surviving Remnant Displaced Persons 1939 main himalar ne oparation himalar kii yojana banaayi, vivaadaaspad rup se europe main yah dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa pehla oparation tha
 Prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Himmler prepared his SS for a genocidal war against the forces of "judeo-bolshevism"
 naji germany or madhya yug kii tulana karke himalar hardam khush hua karte the, ve akraman kii tulana dharmayuddh se kiya karte
 ve puure europe se swayamsevak jamaa kiya karte the, khaskar aise nordic logon ko jo nasleey rup se germanon ke nikatatam maane jate, jaise ki dence, norweyan, swedis or dach
 akraman ke baad, ukrainian, latvian, lithuanian or esthonian swayamsevakon kii bhi bahaali hui, "naastik bolshevik giroh" se puraane europe ke paramparaagat mulyon kii raksha ke liye ek akhil europea dharmayuddh kii ghoshnaa karke gaiyr-german swayamsevakon ko aakarshith kiya jane laga
 Thousands volunteered and more people were forcibly recruited
 baltic rajyon ke mul nivasee laal fuj ke khilaaf kaam karne ke liye taiyaar the, kyonki soviet sangh dwaara kabja kiye jane ke baad utpeedan se unamem nafrat paidaa ho gayi thi
 These people were forcibly recruited into the waffen-ss, were pitted against the Soviet Army, then they were happily engaged in this task
 pashchimi or nordic europe main wafphen-eses ko bhartee ke liye bahut kam log mili, lekin kai wafphen-eses sena ikai kii sthapana kii gayi, jaise ki leone degrele ke netritv kaa vallonian sainya dal, jinhen yuddh ke baad naji kshetra ke phir se praapt burgundi kaa chancelar banane kii himalar kii yojana thi
 In 1942, Himmler's right hand Reinhard Hedrick was killed by the Czech Special Army after an attack close to Prague, with the Czech army being aided by the British Intelligence Department and Czechoslovak rebels
 himalar ne turant pratishodh liya, lidise gaanv kii mahilaon or bacchon sahit puri aabaadi kii htya kar di
 In 1943, Himmler was appointed as Interior Minister of the Reich, replacing the freak with whom he had been struggling for more than a decade
 udhaaharan ke liye, sirf himalar ke saamne gidgidaane ke uddeshy se yatnaa shiviron main logon ko bhejne ke liye "rakshaatmak hiraasat" ke vyapak istemaal ko simit karne kii frick ne koshish kii thi
 Frick viewed the camps as a tool to punish frivolities, while Himmler's opinion was to terrorize people through these camps and accept the Nazi regime
 himalar kii niyukti ne prabhavi rup se aantarik mantralay kaa eses ke saath vilay kar diya
 Himmler used his new office to reverse the combination of party tools from the public service and began to challenge the rights of party leaders at the district-regional level
 hitler ke nijee sachiv or party chancelar martin borman dwaara unki is mahatvakanksha ko jhatka laga
 It also faced some resentment from Hitler himself, whose long-standing hatred of the traditional public service was one of the foundations of Nazi administration's thinking
 rigerv army kaa pramukh banane ke baad himalar ne halaat or bhi badtar kar die, unhone pulicekarmiyon kaa tabadalaa wafphen-eses main karke sena or police donon ke adhikaron kaa istemaal karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Himmler continued to challenge his power base, but Bormann did not give him the chance to move fast, although he was initially silent until the protest began
 phir, borman ne yojana kaa virodh karnaa shuru kiya, himalar kii badanaami hone lagi, khaskar party main, jiske gauliters arthath sthaneey netaaon ne borman ko apane rakshak ke rup main dekhnaa shuru kiya
 It was determined that the senior officers of the German Army's Intelligence Department and its chief Admiral Wilhilm Kanaris were involved in the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler
 is kaaran hitler ne abwehar ko bhang karne kaa nirnay liya or himalar kii suraksha seva ko tisare rikh kaa ekmaatr kufia seva bana diya
 This increased Himmler's personal power
 commander-in-chif of rigerv army ke general fredrick fromm ko ek sajeesh main fansaaya gaya
 Hitler's skepticism towards the army and the dismissal of Fromm opened the way for Himmler to succeed Fromm, he misused the position for the expansion of the waffen-ss, making the German Armed Force's already deteriorating condition even worse
 Started getting worse
 himalar ke durbhaagya se, jald hi jaanch se sajeesh main eses ke adhikariyon ke shaamil hone kaa pataa chalaa, isamen kuch varisht adhikari bhi the, jo eses ke khilaaf borman ke sangharsh main unke ishaare par chalaa karte the, kyonki bahut kam party kaaryakarta adhikariyon ko fansaaya gaya tha
 More importantly, some senior SS officers started conspiring against Himmler himself, as he believed that he could not win in the power struggle against Bormann
 Among these defectors were Ernst Kultenbrunner, head of Heidrick's successor Raichsicheherheitshauptamt, and Gruppenführer Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo
 1944 ke aakhir main, himalar navgathit army group apper rhin ke commander-in-chif ban gayi
 This army group was formed to fight the advancing American 7th Army and the French 1st Army in the Alsace region on the west coast of the Rhine
 america 7veen army general alexander ptch or francisi 1lee army general jin di lattre di tassigni ke cmand main thi
 On 1 January 1945, Himmler's Army Group began Operation North Wind to push back the Americans and the French
 janvari ke ant main, kuch simit shuruaati safalataa ke baad himalar ko purab kii ore sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 As of 24 January, the army group Upper Rhine was defunct due to being defensive
 aadhikarik taur par oparation north wind 25 janvari ko samaapt ho gaya
 On the other hand, the German army failed to stop the vistula-oder aggression of the Red Army, when Hitler commanded Himmler to command another newly formed military group, the army group Vistula was to stop the advancing Soviet army towards Berlin
 army group apper rin kii vifaltaa or sena kii tukadiyon ko netritv dene main unki anubhav kii puri kami tathaa aakshamata ke baavjood hitler ne himalar ko army group vistula kii kaaman saunp di
 The appointment may have been at the instigation of Martin Bormann to discredit the opponent, or because of Hitler's growing anger at the "failure" of military officers
 army group vistula ke commander-in-chif kii haisiyat se himalar ne schneidemuhal main apana cmand centre banaaya
 They used their special train, the Sonderzug Steiermark, as their headquarters
 Himmler did this despite the train having only one telephone line and no signal separation
 apni dridhtaa dikhaane ke liye utsuk, himalar ne sainya adhikariyon ke twarit-hamale ke aagrah ko chupchaap maan liya
 The operation soon became entrenched in the swamp and Himmler sacked a regular army commander and hired Nazi Heinz Lammerding
 unke mukhyalay ko bhi falconberg peeche hatane par majaboor hona padaa
 30 janvari ko, himalar ne krur aadesh jari kiya: tod and strephe fer flitvergessenheit - "jo apane dayitvon ko bhul jate hai unke liye mrityu or dand," apni sena ko protsaahit karne ke liye
 Hitler's pressure on Himmler increased due to the worsening situation; He began to be unsure and restless at conferences
 hitler par general henge guderian ke jabardast dabaav ke kaaran general valther venk ke nirdesh main himalar kii sena ne madhya-farvari main pomerian aakraamakata shuru kii
 By early March, Himmler's headquarters were moved west of the Oder River, although his army's name still remained after Vistula
 hitler ke saath sammelnon main, peeche hatane waalon ke saath kadai main vruddhi karne kii hitler kii niti kaa hi samarthan karte rahe
 On 13 March, Himmler relinquished his command, he began to claim the disease and was admitted to a hospital in Hohenlichen
 guderian ne vahaan unase bhent kii or army group vistula ke commander-in-chif se unka istipha lekar usee raat hitler ko saunp diya
 On 20 March, Gothard Heinrichi was made general in place of Himmler
 1944-45 kii sardiyon main, himalar ke wafphen-eses kii sadsy sankhya 910,000 thi, saath hi allgamen-eses ke kareeb do million sadsy the
 However, Himmler's confidence in the German victory arose in early 1945, especially from conversations with his masseur Felix Kirsten and Walter Schellenberg
 He felt that peace talks with Britain and the United States were necessary if Nazi rule was to be saved
 unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki soviet sangh ke khilaaf vyaktigat rup se rajdhani kii raksha karne ke liye berlin main rahakar hitler ne khud ko bebas bana liya he
 So he contacted Count Folk Bernadotte of Sweden in Lübeck near the Danish border
 unhone apane aapako germany ke taatkaalik netaa ke rup main pesh kiya or barnadot se kaha ki hitler do dinon ke andar lagbhag nishchit taur par mar janevaale hai
 He asked Bernadotte to tell General Dwight Eisenhower that Germany wanted to surrender to the West
 himalar ko ummid thi ki baaki bache veharmat ke saath milakar british or america soviet sangh se ladaai karenge
 At Bernadotte's request, Himmler gave his proposal in writing
 28 april kii shaam ko, bibisi ne ek riter news report kaa prasaaran karte hue pashchimi mitra rashtron ke saath himalar ke vaarta ke prayaas ke bare main khabar di
 When Hitler was told about this news, he was enraged
 kuch din pehle, harman goring ne rikh kaa netritv sanbhaalane ke liye hitler se anumati chaahi thi - borman ke bhadakaane par hitler ne unke is aagrah kii vyakhya is tarah kii jaise ki unhen kursi se utar jane yaa phir takhtapalat kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 However, Himmler did not even care to request permission
 is khabar se hitler ko joro kaa jhatka isliye bhi laga kyonki ve joseph goabals ke baad himalar ko apana doosraa sabase bada vafaadaar maanate the; darasal, hitler aksar hi himalar ko "der thru henrikh" kaha karte the
 After being pacified, Hitler told those still in the bunker with him that Himmler's act was the worst example of betrayal
 himalar ke vishwasghaat ke alaava is khabar se ki soviet sena chancelari se maatr 300 meter kii duuri par he, ne hitler ko apni aakhri ichha or vasietnama likhane ke liye baadhya kar diya
 He testified Himmler and Göring as traitors in a testament completed the day before he committed suicide
 unhone ne himalar ko unke sabhi party or sarkari padon se hataa diya: unhen rikhfuharer-eses, german police ke pramukh, german nesanhud ke ayukta, rikh ke aantarik mantri, volcstrum ke supreme commander or home army ke supreme commander padon se hataa diya gaya
 Finally, he ordered his arrest, expelling Himmler from the Nazi party
 count barnadot ke saath himalar kii vaarta vifal rahi
 He then took refuge with Grand Admiral Karl Donitz, then leading all the German forces on the western front near Pion
 donitz ne himalar ko waapas kar diya, yah kehete hue ki nayi german sarkaar main unke liye koi jagah nahin he
 However, the talks made it possible to release some 15,000 Scandavian prisoners from the remaining torture camps
 iske baad himalar ne ek dalbadalu kii tarah americanyon se sampark saadhaa, ijanhaavar ke mukhyalay se sampark karke unhone puri germany ke mitra rashtron ke samaksh samarpan karne kaa daawa karte hue apane ko baksh die jane kii shart rakhi
 unhone ijanhaavar se kaha ki unhen yudhoparant germany sarkaar kaa "police mantri" bana diya jaay
 ve supreme headquarters ellid force ke commander ke saath kis tarah pehali baithak karenge or unhen naji salaam karenge yaa unase haath milaayenge, is par unhone kathith taur par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Einhaver denied Himmler any compromise and was declared a major war criminal
 apane purv sahyogiyon dwaara avankshit or mitra rashtron dwaara kii ja rahi talash ke kaaran himalar anek dinon tak danish seemaa ke paas flenberg ke aasapaas bhatakate rahe
 To avoid arrest, he disguised himself as sergeant-major of the Intelligence Military Police, renamed Heinrich Hützinger, cut his mustache and put a bandage over his left eye, in the hope that he would be able to return to Bavaria
 He had kept a complete set of documents forged by him, but it was considered unusual for anyone to have the papers in such order and the British Army Unit based in Bremen was suspicious
 22 may ko major sidney excel ne giraftaar kiya or hiraasat main unhen jald hi pahchaan liya gaya
 Himmler, along with other German leaders, was to be tried in Nuremberg as a war criminal, but he committed suicide in Lüneburg by eating potassium cyanide capsules on May 23 before interrogation began
 unke antim shabd the ich bin henrikh himalar! 
 ek or vaktavy yah he ki ek british doctor jab khoj kar rahaa tha, tab apane daanton main chhipaakar rakhi cynaid goli ko himalar ne chaba liya tha, is par doctor ne cheekh kar kaha tha, "isane apana kaam kar liya!" himalar ko bachaane ke kai prayaas vifal rahe
 Shortly afterwards, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave at Lüneburg Heath
 himalar kii kabr kaa sateek sthaan agyaat he
 In May 2008, a British police investigation identified "29 forgeries that were missing in 12 files since 2000", which were recently used to prove Himmler's conspiracies and conjectures

 "jab hitler ko dyuk of windsar ke die patr ke bare main unhen chunauti di gayi to ellen ne jawaab main kaha ki yah unke swargeey pita ko albert spear dwaara diya gaya tha, jo baad main lekhak kii ataari main mila
 Historians are divided about the psychology, intentions and influences that govern Himmler
 Some believe that Hitler dominated them, they were fully under his influence and a tool to carry Hitler's ideas to their logical end
 In the opinion of others, Himmler was an avid anti-semitist in his own right and was more keen than his leader to carry out the massacre
 While others believe that Himmler was a persecutor, who was busy in increasing his power and influence
 robert es wisterik ke anusaar, himalar kii nirnaayak navrachana yah thi ki unhone nasleey jaise prashn kaa roopaantar "yahudee-virodh par aadhaarit ek nakaaratmak vichaar" se "eses ke nirmaan ke liye ek sanghathanaatmak kaary main" kar diya
 

 It was Himmler's feat that without any sense of sin and responsibility, he managed to fill the ss's mind with all-round "idealism", which justified genocide and harshness towards anyone as a martyr
 yudhkalin cartoonist victor veisz ne himalar ko ek vishaal octopus ke rup main darshaya, jo peedit rashtron ko apni aathon bhujaaon main jakadaaa hua he
 Historian Wolfgang Sauer of the University of California, Berkeley, felt that "although he was a pedantic, fanatical and dull type, Himmler rose to second place after Hitler in real power
 Unusual finesse, blazing ambition, and jealousy towards Hitler
 Their strength was inherent in a combination of loyalty
 " himalar ne apane nijee maalisia felics karston se kaha tha ki ve hardam apane saath bhagavad gita kii ek prati rakhaa karte hai, taaki isse unhen antim samaadhaan ko lagu karne main paap kaa bodh na ho; ve mahasoos kiya karte the ki apane kaaryon ke prati koi lagaav rakhe bina yoddha arjuna kii tarah ve bhi sirf apana kartavya kiye ja rahe hai
 Himmler's ideas were probably influenced by Jakob Vihelm Hauer's ideas derived from his interpretation of the Gita
 norman bruke kii pustak waar cabinet diarij ke ek uddhran main, winston churchill ne yuddh ke dauraan himalar kii vyapak hissedari ko dekhte hue unki hatya karne kii salaah di
 According to Brook, in response to an advice to punish Nazi leaders, "churchill asked if he should talk to Himmler and later be pushed to death, once the peace conditions were met
 Himmler's The advice to negotiate a German surrender with and later assassinate him received the support of the Home Office
 Suggestions for a German surrender deal with Himmler To diminution and then killing him support met with Office Home

 " haal ke ek kaary kaa mukhya mudda yah he ki jiske liye ve pratispardhaa karte rahe or hitler kaa dhyaan khinchne tathaa sammaan paane ke liye himalar kis had tak gayi
 The events of the last days of the war, when he left Hitler and began separate negotiations with the Allies, are clearly important in this regard

 2008 main, german samachar patrika der spigel dwaara himalar ko "sarvakalik sabase bada narsanhaarak" qaraar diya gaya, isse vidhwans ke vaastukar ke rup main unki bhoomika pratibimbit hoti he
 While their continuing public recognition is mirrored in modern Germany, statistical research on Democide shows that these claims are highly exaggerated, even when their personal responsibilities are collectively considered with Hitler and his other assistants 
 ucch padon kii tithiyaan From 1929 onwards Himmler only mentioned himself with his title of Reichsführer; Which was not his real post until 1934
 puraskaar As head of the SS, Himmler had such unique ability that he was in a position to "reward himself" with numerous Nazi military, civilian and political medals
 haalanki, himalar ke aadhikarik puraskaar or alankaran unhen mukhyatah seva padakon or yogyata billon ke yogya banaate the, yah jahiraa taur par yojana ke tahat kiya gaya
 Like many top Nazi leaders, Himmler did not feel the need for grand prizes and decorations for himself, but would rather preserve these titles for junior members of the movement, who saw such awards as an inspiration

 Himmler seldom wore these additional medals, except in formal government ceremonies where they were required to be in full uniform
