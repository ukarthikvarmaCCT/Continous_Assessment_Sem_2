 The digestive system of humans consists of a dietary canal and associate glands
 aahaar-naal, mukhaguha, grasani, grasika, amashay, choti aant, badi aant, malashay or maladwar se bani hoti he
 Supporting digestive glands are the salivary gland, liver, gall bladder and pancreatic
 aahaar padaarthon ke vishesh ghatak protein, carbohydrate, vasa, vitamin, khanij lavan or jal hai
 All foods are made up of these components
 kisi main koi ghatak adhik hota he, koi kam
 Our body is also made of these ingredients
 sharir kaa 2 / 3 bhaag jal he
 Protein is the main body of the body from which organs are formed
 carbohydrate glucose ke rup main sharir main rahata he, jisaki mansapeshiyon ko sadaa aavashyaktaa hoti he
 An excessive amount of fat is also stored in the body
 vitamin or lavenon kii aavashyaktaa sharir kii kriyaaon ke uchit sampadan ke liye hoti hai
 Our body gets all these things from food
 haan, aahaar se milane vaale avyavon kaa rasinic rup sharir ke avyavon ke rup se bhinn hota he
 Therefore, the body decomposes the components of the diet into its subtle components by digestive juices and by re-synthesizing those components, prepares the ingredients suitable for them
 yah kaam angon kii koshikaaye karti hai
 It leaves out the components that are not useful
 sharir aise padaarthon ko mel, mutr, swead or shwaas dwaara baahar nikaal detaa he
 The purpose of digestion is to divide the esoteric ingredients of the diet into simple components
 yah kaary munh main lala ras dwaara, amashay main jathar ras dwaara, grahani main agnyashay ras tathaa pitt dwaara or kshundaatra main antraras dwaara sampadit hota he
 These works are briefly described here: mukh main aahaar daanton dwaara chabaakar sookshm kanon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he or usamen laar miltaa rahata hai, jisamen tylin naamak enzim mila rahata he
 This juice is made in the cupric gland outside the mouth and in the adrenal and adrenal glands
 in grathiyon se, visheshkar aahaar ko chabate samay unki vahniyon dwaara, laar ras munh main aata rahata he
 Its action is alkaline
 uske tylin anzime kii rasinic kriya visheshkar carbohydrate par hoti hai, jisase uskaa starch pehle dextrin main or tatpashchaat glucose main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The same changes in the sugar of ordinary reed
 aahaar ke grass ko geela or snigdh karnaa bhi lala kaa mukhya karm hai, jisase vah sahaj main niglaa ja sake or patala grass naal main hota hua amashay main pahunch jaay
 Swallowing is done inside the mouth by the muscles of the tongue and the muscles of the pharynx
 jihva kii peshiyon ke sankoch se jihva upar ko uthakar taalu or jihvaprishth par rakhe hue grass ko dabaati he, jo vahaan se phisalkar peeche grasani se chalaa jaataa he
 Immediately, the muscles of the pharynx hesitate and the Grass enters the esophagus, passing through the gland, where the circular and longitudinal sutures in its reefs lead it to the end of the placenta by its inhibition and expansion
 or grass jatharadwar dwaara amashay main pravesh karata he
 Digestion in the stomach is done by gastritis
 amashay kii shleshmal kala kii granthiyaan yah ras utpann karti hai
 When the food reaches the stomach, this juice starts to flow from the surrounding glands to the stomach at such a rapid rate as if it is being poured out
 is ras ke do mukhya avyav pepsin naamak angm or hydrochloric amla hote hai
 Pepsin has a special action on proteins, in which hydrochloric acid helps
 is kriya se protein pehle phool jaataa he or phir baahar se galane lagata he
 Due to this, the inner part of the grass gets late
 isse lala ke tilin enzim kii kriya us samay tak hoti rahati he jab tak lala kaa sara kshar amashay ke amlik ras dwaara udasin nahin ho jaataa
 Metaprotein is formed before protein by the action of gastric juice
 phir yah proteoseze main badal jaataa he
 The proteases then break down into peptones
 isse adhik parivartan nahin hota
 There are also two more enzymes in gastric juice, which are called amylase and lipase
 aimylez karbohydrate ko galaata he or lypez vasa ko
 It also contains renin, another enzyme that breaks down milk
 isamen halaki jeevanunashak shakti bhi hoti he
 The secretion of gastric juice is mainly under the nervous system
 sharirkriya vigyaan ke vikhyath roosi vidwaan pavelof ke prayogon ne is sambandh main bahut prakaash daalaa he
 It has been proved from them that the smell of food starts smelling from the nose and seeing them through the eyes
 yahi kaaran he ki uttam aahaar padaarthon ke banane kii gandh se hi bhukh maaloom hone lagati he tathaa unako dekhne se kshudha bad jaati he
 Applying on the tongue causes a desire to eat immediately
 yadi aahaar padaarth uttam yaa ruchikar nahin hote to bhukh mar jaati he
 Digestion of such food is also not done properly
 usase ras kaa srav bhi kam hota he
 The process of gastric juice is particularly on protein
 maance, anda, machhlee, doodh ke padaarthon aadi ke amashay main pahunchne par ras kaa srav hota hai
 If salt, ice or pebbles, etc
 are given to eat, there will be no discharge
 pachan se agnyashay or yakrut in do badi grathiyon kaa bahut sambandh he
 Pancreas juice is produced in the pancreas
 yah bahut hi prabal pachak ras he, jisaki kriya protein, carbohydrate tathaa vasa teenon ghatakon par hoti he
 It is formed by the cells of the pancreas gland and collected from all the pancreas, this juice reaches the duodenum through a duct
 pitashay se pitt ko laanevaali vahini is agnyashayvahini se milakar saamaanya pittavahini ban jaati he
 Through his mouth, both the pancreas and bile, the juices, reach the duodenum
 agnyashayi granthi udar main bain ore amashay ke peeche sthit he
 Its large head rests in the bend of the duodenum and its tail has gone to the left spleen
 iskaa rang kuch matamaila bhura sa hota he
 Its subtle parts appear to be raised like mulberry grains
 agnyashay ras kii prabal kriya visheshkar protein par hoti he
 This causes the protein to dissolve without bloating
 is ras kii kriya kshareey hoti he
 This causes the first alkaline metaprotein to form
 tab metaprotein se proteos banate hai
 The proteases are then converted into peptones
 ant main peptone ke vibhanjan se amino amla ban jate hai, jo protein ke pachan ke antim utpaada hote hai
 Peptones that come as a result of digestion of proteins from the stomach also break down into amino acids
 agnyashay ras ke srav par tantrika mandal kaa koi niyantran nahin he
 The stimulation of nerves does not produce more or less of the juice
 ras kii utpatti us samay prarambh hoti he jab amashay main paachit aahaar, jo ardh drav rup kaa hota he, amashay se pyloric chhidr dwaara nikalakar grahani main aata he
 Through contact with this acidic chym, a chemical substance called secretin is produced in the mucous level cells of the duodenum
 yah vastu rakt dwaara agnyashay kii koshikaon main pahunchakar unako ras banane ke liye uttejit karti he or tab ras banakar grahani main aane lagata he
 The second feature of this juice is that if this juice is collected in the pancreas before reaching the duodenum, it remains inactive
 uski protein par koi kriya nahin hoti
 When it joins the duodenum, it combines with the intestinal juice, only then it produces a strong power to decompose the protein
 yah mana jaataa he ki antric ras kaa anterokinage naamak enzim usko sakriy kar detaa he
 These are the following: udar ke daahine bhaag main upar kii ore sharir kii yakrut naamak sabase badi granthi he, jo pitt kaa nirmaan karti he
 From there, the bile gets collected in the gall bladder and reaches the duodenum by a duct during digestion
 yakrut se sidhaa grahani main bhi pahunch saktaa hai
 It is a thick green liquid liquid
 vasa ke pachan main isse sahaayta milti he
 The food from the duodenum, which contains its digestible components, enters the first part of the esophagus in the forelimbs
 is samay vah shahad ke samaan gadha hota he or kshudantra main bhalee prakaar pravaahit ho saktaa he
 Digestion continues here too
 kuch samay tak agnyashayi pachan jari rahata he
 The juice of the intestines also has digestive power
 vah protein ko to nahin, kintu proteos or paptone ko amino amlon main tod saktaa he
 But its special action is to activate dipsin amylase and lipase enzymes
 pavelof kaa, jisane sabase pehle is vishay main anveshan kiye the, mat he ki antra ras ke milane se pehle ye teenon enzim apane purv rup main rahete hai or isi kaaran niskriy hote hai
 Trypsin lives as trypsinogen
 amiles or lypez bhi purv dasha main rahete hai
 When enterocrine is found in the pancreas, trypsinogen produces trypsin and the rest of the enzymes are also activated
 antric ras ke milane se purv agnyashay ras niskriy hota he
 The function of the esophagus is exclusively absorption
 isaki aantarik rachana ke chitra ko dekhne se maaloom hoga ki uske bheetar shleshmal kala main, jo saare antra ko bheetar se aachhadit kiye hue hai, gahari silawatein bani hui hai, jisase kala kaa prishth antra se kahin adhik ho jaataa he
 There are sprouts on the folds of art
 in sabakaa kaam avasorana karnaa he
 The subtle composition of the seedlings is also worth noting
 prayek ankur ke bich main ek shwetanlika uske shikhar ke paas tak chali gai he
 It is akshiravahini
 iske donon ore kaali rekhaayen dikhaai detii hai, jo dhamni or shiraaon kii shakhaayen or koshikaaye hai
 Both these types of structures, vessels and arteries and veins, go out or down and are found in the large blood vessels and vessels in the epidemiological level
 vasa kaa shleshmalkala dwaara avasorana hokar vah akshirvahiniyon main pahunch jaati he or ant main rakt main mil jaati he
 After absorption of glucose and protein they reach the blood by blood capillaries
 rakt in teenon avyavon ko sharir ke prayek ang kii koshikaon tak pahunchaata or unka poshan karata he
 This is the special function of the 20-22 feet long tubule
 brihadantra kaa kaary keval avasorana he
 This organ especially absorbs water
 malatyag ke samay mel jis rup main baahar nikalataa he, vah brihadantra ke ant or malashay main ban jaataa he
 In 24 hours, the colon absorbs water
 jal ke atirikt vah thode glucose kaa bhi avasorana karata he, par or kisi padaarth kaa avasorana nahin karata
 Apart from this, iron, magnesium, calcium etc
 are sacrificed in the colon itself
 yahan unka utsarg hokar ve mel main mil jate hai
 The action of bacteria also aids digestion
 kshudantra main ve protein, vasa tathaa starch aadi kaa bhanjan karte hai
 In the colon, they also dissolve cellulose, which does not contain any digestive juices
 isi se hydrogen sulphide, mithen aadi gaisen utpann hoti hai tathaa vasa ke bhanjan se vasaml banate hai, jinke kaaran mel kii kriya amlik ho jaati he
 This movement continues throughout the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the rectum, which leads to continued eating or digestion
 anya aashyon main tathaa vahikaaon main bhi yah gati hoti he
 There are circular circles outside the mucosa level and levels of longitudinal musculature outside them
 vrittakar sutron ke sankoch se naal kii chaudaai sankuchit ho jaati he
 Therefore, hesitantly, part of the diet ahead cannot return to the rear
 tabhi anudairdhya sutara sankoch karke naal ke us bhaag kii lambaai kam kar dete hai
 Therefore, the diet progresses further
 phir aage ke bhaag main isi prakaar kii kriya se vah or aage badhata he
 This is called entrapment
 duusari khandibhavan gati bhi naal kii bhitti main hoti rahati he
 These movements, in addition to helping to advance the diet, churn the chime in a good way, causing a close contact between the digestive juices and the particles of the diet
 bhinn bhinn pachak rason kii kriya kaa jo varnan kiya gaya he usase spasht he ki prakruti ne aisa prabandh kiya he ki aahaar padaarthon ke sab avyav, jo jautav sharir main bhi upasthit rahete hai, vyarth na jane paaen
 Use them as much as possible in the body
 unase sharir ke toote phute bhaagon kaa nirmaan ho, nae utak bhi bane or kaam karne kii urja utpann ho
 This is the purpose of diet and differentiating the different ingredients of the diet into their very subtle elements, so that they are absorbed and the cells of the body prepare their essential things from them, this is the purpose of digestion
 vastav main jisko saadhaaran bolchaal main pachan kaha jaataa he, usamen do kriyaaon kaa bhav chipa rahata he, pachan or avasorana
 Digestion is simply the breakdown of the components of the diet into its components, which are the result of digestive juices
 unka avasorana hokar rakt main pahunchnaa duusari kriya he, jo kshudantra ke rasankuron kaa vishesh karm he
 Any part of the diet that remains in the bowel after digestion and absorption is the same stool
 atev mel main aahaar kaa kuch apchy bhaag bhi hota he tathaa antra kii shleshmal kala ke tukade hote hai
 Apart from these, there are very large numbers of bacteria
 yah hisaab lagaaya gaya he ki prayek baar mel main 15,00,00,00,000 jeevanu sharir se nikalate hai
 They come from the colon itself
 vahi jeevanuon kaa nivasasthaan he
 Due to this there is a lot of nitrogen in the stool, which makes it a good fertilizer
 malatyag kii ek prativart kriya he, jiskaa sampadan tantric mandal ke aatmag vibhaag dwaara hota he
 When faeces are collected in the rectum, they are injected into the cells of the warts of the spinal cord from the rectum's recesses at the appointed time, from where they are sent to the cells of the precursors
 vahaan se nae samveg prerak tantric sutron dwaara malashay main pahunchakar, vahaan kii sanvarni peshiyon kaa vistaar kar dete or malashay kii bhittiyon kii antragati badha dete hai
 At the same time, we have a desire to have a bowel movement and we have a bowel movement when we sit and the muscular muscles have become loose
 upar kii peshiyon ke sankoch karne par udar ke bheetar kii daab badhane se bhi malatyag main bahut sahaayta milti he
 Fadi Madagascar speaks of taboo on a variety of things in the culture of the island-country
 faadi kaa vishay log, sthaan, kriyaayein or vastuen ho sakati hai or ve madagascar main sthaan-se-sthaan bhinn hoti hai
 Many Fadis are related to ancestor worship in Malagasy culture, and its violation is believed to have displeased supernatural powers
 faadi malagasi jaateey pahchaan main mahatvapurn hai or samaaj ko jodne ke liye bhi laabhadaayak maane jate hai
 In Malagasy, for "kindly" and "sorry", we say "azaafadi", which means that "what i am doing may not be free for me"
 faadi ke kuch udhaaharan is prakaar hai or yah kaary sabhi malagasi samskruti main sakht manaa hai - According to the place and time in Malagasy society, new farmers have been continuously formed
 kisi bhi naye kaary yaa vyapaar ko armbh karne se pehle "joro" naamak bhoga chadhaaya jaataa he jis se yah sabit hota he ki us kaary se faadi-ulanghan nahin hoga
 Fadi breaking is called "ota Fadi" and if one is known or inadvertently "ota Fadi", it is considered to be inverted and addressed by the name "maloto" and stay away from it
 samaaj uski ore ghrinaa se dekhtaa he or use samaaj ko khatare main daalane kaa zimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he
 Tourists visiting Madagascar are also advised to respect the Fadi restrictions

 kiratarjunium mahakavi bharavi dwaara saatvin shatee i
 main rachit mahakavy he jise sanskrit sahitya main mahakavyon kii 'vrihattrayee' main sthaan praapt he
 Based on the short story of Arjuna's war with Kiratveshi Shiva described in the Mahabharata, the poet has given a captivating description of politics, religion, diplomacy, socialism, war, politics and life
 yah kavy vibhinn rason se otprot he kintu yah mukhyatah vir ras pradhan rachana he
 There are six famous epics of Sanskrit - Brihattrayi and Minatrayi
 kiratarjanuyium, shishupalavdham or naishadhicharitam – brihattrayee kehalaate hai
 Kumarasambhavam, Raghuvansham and Meghdootam - are called miniatures
 kiratarjunium bharavi kii ekmaatr uplabdh kriti he, jisane ek sangopang mahakavy kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Magha-like poets, following the same, enriched the Sanskrit literature store with this genre and gave it a new height
 kalidas kii laghutrayee or ashwaghosh ke buddhacharitam main mahakavy kii jis dhara kaa darshan hota he, apane vishisht gunon ke hote hue bhi usamen vah vishadta or samagrata nahin he, jiskaa sutarapaat bharavi ne kiya
 There have been at least 37 commentaries of Kiratarajuniyam in Sanskrit, of which the Mallinath commentary is the best
 san 1912 main karl cappalar ne harvard oriyental siries ke antargat kiratarjunium kaa german anuwaad kiya
 There have been more than six translations of its different parts in English as well
 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti main bharavi ke vishesh rujhaan ke chalate yah yuktiyukt hi tha ki ve kiratarjunium kaa kathanak mahabharat se uthaate
 He raised the small theme of acquiring Pashupatastra as a result of Shiva's abject penance by Arjuna for the unfolding of the Pandavas during the exile of the Pandavas from the five chapters of Vanaparva and gave it the form of this epic of eighteen cantos
 jab yudhisthir kauravon ke saath sampann dyutakrida main sab kuch haar gayi to unhen apane bhaaiyon evam draupadi ke saath 13 varsh ke vanvaas par janaa padaa
 Most of his time was spent in dualism
 vanvaas ke kashton se khinn hokar or kauravon dwaara kii gayi sajeesh ko yaad karke draupadi yudhisthir ko aksar prerit karti thim ki ve yuddh kii taiyaari karen or yuddh ke madhyam se kauravon se apana rajpth waapas len
 Bhima also favors Draupadi's talk
 guptchar ke rup main hastinapur bheje gaye ek vanechar se soochna milti he ki duryodhana apane sammilit rajya ke sarvangin vikaas or sudrudhikaran main dattachitt he, kyonki kapat-dyut se hastgat kiye gaye aadhe rajya ke liye use pandavon se ashanka he
 The Pandavas also feel that at the end of the period of exile, half of their kingdom will not be returned without war
 draupadi or bhim yudhisthir ko vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone kii pratiksha na kar duryodhana par turant akraman ke liye uksaate hai, lekin adarshavaadi, kshamashil yudhisthir vyavhaar kii maryaada laanghane ko taiyaar nahin
 Vyas, who has come there, advises that the Pandavas should advance their power for future war
 unheen ke dwaara bataae gaye upaay ke anusaar arjuna shastrastra ke liye indra ko tap se prasann karne ke liye ek yaksha ke maargdarshan main himalay-sthit indrakil parvat kii ore chal padate hai
 Indra is present in the guise of an old sage after taking the test by sending apsaras etc
 as a result of austerities done by building an ashram there and illustrating the importance of charitableness, stating the perishable cosmic goal of austerity
 arjuna isaki kaat main kauravon dwaara kiye gaye chal evam anyaay kaa lekha-jokha prastutkar shatru se pratishodh lene kii anivaaryta, saamaajik kartavya-paalan tathaa anyaay ke pratikaar kaa tark dekar indra ko santusht kar dete hai
 As a result, Indra, appearing in his real form, advises Arjuna to do penance for Shiva for mano-fulfillment
 arjuna phir se ghor, niraahaar tapasya main leen ho jate hai
 Arjuna is a stranger to Indrakil, ascetic, jata, Valkal and mrigacharm, but he also has armor in the body, in place of Yajnopavit, there is a Gandhiv bow with a pratchancha, two huge tarakas and a perfect pillar
 use munidharm-virdohi samajhakar vahaan ke anya tapasvi aatankit hai or shankar ke paas nivedan ke liye pahunch jate hai
 In his order, Shiva, disguised as the commander of the local tribal tribe, arrives to Arjuna with the army of his ganas
 tabhi 'mook' naam kaa ek daanav arjuna kii tapasya ko devataaon kaa kaary samajhakar, vishaal shookar kaa sharir dharankar, usko maarane ke liye jhapatata he
 a similar arrow fired simultaneously by both Shiva and Arjuna ends that pig's illusion
 shiv kaa baan to uske sharir ko bedhta hua dharti main dhans jaataa he or arjuna jab apana baan uske sharir se nikaalane jate hai to shiv apane ek gana ko bhejkar vivaad khadaa kara dete hai
 As a result, a war between the two begins
 arjuna ganon kii sena ko to baan-varsha se bhaagane ko majaboor kar dete hai par shiv ke saath hue yuddh main parrast ho jate hai
 Desperate from defeat, Arjuna recognizes Shiva and surrenders, disguised as Kirat-senapati, leading Shiva to appear happy and impart Pashupatastra to him
 is tarah arjuna kaa mantavya puraa hone ke saath mahakavy-vidha ke bhi saare mantavya siddh ho jate hai
 Apart from this extraterrestrial myth of the Kiratha prostitute Shiva, this episode also has its own specific tribal expression, which brings this poetry closer to the current sentiment
 yudhisthir or guptchar bane vanechar ke bich ghatit samvaad main vanechar kii jo atoot swamibhakti, adamya nirbhikta or ucch raajnneetik samaj saamne aati he, vah vanavaasiyon ke prati bharavi kii pakshabharata main andeh kii koi gunjaaish nahin chhodti
 Vancher makes it clear in the beginning- is puure prakaran ke armbh main draupadi kii baton ke samarthan main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ke prati kuchek nitiwachan kahe gayi hai
 One of them is cited below: bharavi apane arth-gaurav ke liye jane jate hai—‘upama kalidassy bharverrthgauravam’
 His wealth is an ingenious language and expressive skills matching this sense of pride
 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti sahit jivan ke vividh ayaamon main unki asaadhaaran paith he
 The balance earned by the duality of ideals and attitudes and the excesses of excesses of real life makes his writing 'all-rounder'
 lekin bharavi mulat: jivan kii vidambnaaon or visangatiyon ke kavi hai, unka saamana karte hai or unke khurdure yatharth ke bich sangati bithaane kaa prayaas karte hai

 vinaashak yaa dhvasank - saamudrik / nausainik bhashaa main vinaashak pot teji se chal kar hamalaa karne vaale yuddh poton ko kaha jaataa hai
 They were invented in the early years of the 20th century and since then their place in the naval war has been unmatched
 bahumukhi or vishwasaneey kaaryon kaa daayitv safaltaapurvak vahan karne ke kaaran nausena ke itihaas main iskaa sthaan bejod ho gaya he
 Therefore, its past, present and future are worth studying
 yah nishchit he ki vinaashak kaa avishkaar tarpedo ke kaaran hua
 The torpedoes revolutionized the naval war
 yah pehla avasar tha jab tarpedo se las chota jahaaj vishaal nausena se morcha lekar use nasht kar saktaa tha
 The development of small ships became necessary with this revolutionary invention in the naval ecosystem
 iske do kaaran the : It is for these reasons that the destroyer was invented
 praarambhik dhvasankon main, jinhen "tarpedo naudhvasank' kehete the, keval do tarpedo nalikaay hoti thim
 They used to mount a cannon on the front to attack the enemy's destroyers
 ye jahaaj bahut chote, 200 se 300 ton visthaapan ke, hote the
 In order to increase the impact of the destroyer over time, it was considered necessary to carry more and more torpedoes
 tarpedo naliyon kii sankhya dhire-dhire badhati gai or dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay tak do mouting par aath nalika ke rahane kaa maanvikaran hua
 As soon as the airplane entered the invasive shells, it was seen that the avalanche cannon on the destroyer was necessary to protect against air attacks
 prarambh main dhwansak par saamaanya mashinagan sthapit kii gai thi, par aisi choti topon main sanhaarshakti nahin hoti thi, at: baad main ubhay prayojan kii top sthapit kii gai
 When the submarine was developed, a further work was done on the destroyer
 vah tha, pandubbiyon kaa pataa lagaana or unka vinaash karnaa
 As a result, destructive submarine weapons were also carried
 isse dhwansak kaa aakaar or vistaar bad janaa swaabhaavik tha
 Before the First World War, where destroyers used to displace only 300 days of tons, today more than 2,000 tons of displacement have started becoming destroyers
 pichhali kuch dashabdiyon main vinaashkon main anek amul sudhaar hue hai, lekin isaki aadharbhoot visheshtao, jaise tej gati or yuddhayaskshmata main antar nahin hua he
 In the absence of high speed, there is less chance of the destroyers escaping when attacking large ships
 samudr main rakshit rahane inaki ascharyajanak kshamta inke suwahi aakaar or abhikalp ke kaaran he
 The weapons which remain in the destroyer can be divided into three categories: 1
 jahaajon par akraman karne ke liye tarpedo, 2
 The weapon for the attack on the submarine, 3
 vayuyan or choti-moti sthal senaaon se ladane ke liye ubhayprayojaneey topein
 As such, destructors are designed to attack large ships with torpedoes, however, in the modern naval war, the importance of torpedoes is gradually decreasing as the chances of a torpedo attack decrease
 kintu aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki tarpedo akraman ke din ab lad chale
 Pursuers and returning torpedoes may return the day of the ship's torpedoes
 kuch logon ke kathananusaar pandubbi kaa itnaa vikaas ho chukaa he ki vinaashak dwaara use nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Although this statement is true to some extent, close examination reveals that even today the destroyer is capable of killing the submarine
 pichley mahayuddh main vinaashkon ne 300 pandubbiyaan samudr main dubaa di thim
 Now even remote Lakshwedhi weapons and improved self-contained tips are available, which has greatly increased the potential of destroyers
 drone helicopter or rocket yukt pandubbimaar tarpedo ke kaaran pandubbiyon ko khojkar nasht karne kii kshamta vinaashkon main bahut bad gai he
 It was only natural for sea ships to increase the vulnerability of aircrafts as the crisis of air attacks increased
 kintu radar niyantrit or tatkshan prahaar karanevaali topein bhi paradhvanik aghati vayuyanon se raksha nahin kar saktin
 When a controlled missile is used in place of the cannon, as in the end, the destroyers will prevail as before
 dhwansak jahaji bede ke sarvaadhik vishwasaneey ang hai
 In the last World War, destroyers did all kinds of work
 inhone krithik dalon ko chhipaay, kaphilon ko anurakshit le gaye, praarambhik surveykshan dalon kaa parivahan kiya, jalsthaleey ghat ko chipa rakhaa, yuddh main hataahat logon ko bachaaya or dak vitaran kiya
 Also submerged about 300 submarines
 ye jal ke tal par bahut nikat sthit yupoton se lekar cruzaron, dhwanskon or petrol jalayanon se jujhe
 The future of destroyers seems bright
 bhavishya main ye vaahak krithik sen ke atyaavashyak ang honge
 These will strengthen air defense by substantially increasing the range of the combat operations and controlling the carrier air movement
 tej jahjon ko pandubbi se dhwansak hi bachaa saktaa he
 The best submarines will be unmatched in the hunt to find destroyers armed with weapons
 dhwansak aaj bhi saarth anurakshan kaary main atyadhik upyogi jahaaj siddh hry he
 How the future destroyers will be made can only be hypothesized, but keeping in view the modern inclination, this hypothesis will be very real
 bhavi dhwansak praaia: nishchit rup se newcleey shakti sanchalit hoga, kyonki newcleey shakti hi ekmaatr saadhan hogi, jisase dhwansak kii sahansheeltaa badhaai ja sakati he
 Tolerance of the destroyers will serve an importance in the future, no doubt, as the task force may have to remain at sea for weeks
 dhwansak kii chaal bhi badhanaa aavashyak hoga
 a future destroyer can easily run at a speed of 50 knots
 tarpedo astr-shastron ko kam karnaa aavashyak hoga
 But submarine torpedoes may remain in the destroyer
 inamen rocket laga hoga, tarpedo main lagi lautanevaali sakriy yuktiyaan aisi hongi ki unhen shghrita se nalon main bharaa ja sake
 The cannons will have to be completely removed and replaced with floor-to-floor controlled missiles
 dhwanskon par drone helicopter bhi rahenge
 In summary, the work of destroyers with the latest types of submarine weapons, sophisticated search devices and controlled missile batteries will be very important in future warfare

 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short
 yahaan free shabd kaa arth swatantraaa se he par free shabd kaa arth bina paise ke bhi hota he isaliye free shabd kaa prayog kuch chakkar main daal detaa he

 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It’s still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy

 Many difficult questions are explained very easily in this
 isamen ve free software kii kamiyon ko is tarah se varnan karte hai, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance

 bagdh brahman / BAGRA / BAGDA / BAGADA The origins of Bagda Brahmins are believed to be from the 52 sages who were called by King Anangpal of Delhi from the Gangahat of Kashipuri
 yahaan vaas karne vaale brahman, brahm putr rishi bharadwaj ke vanshaj gaud brahman hi the
 According to the available information, their Gutras also belong to the Gaud Brahmins
 jinhi se bagdh brahmanon ki utpatti hui
 Therefore it can be said that Bagda is a Brahmin who is called 'bagaur Brahmin' because of his residence at a place called Bagaur
 kalantar main yahi bagaur shabd 'babood' phir 'bagdh' ke rup main prachlit ho gaya
 In the capital of India, Vikram Samvat in 1169, Anagpal, the last king of Tanwar dynasty, was crowned
 kuch samay pashchaat 'dilli' raja anangpal ke sapane main aayi or use chhodkar jane kii baat kahi
 The king told his dream to his total priest Jagdish Rishi and asked for a solution to keep his kingdom stable
 is par jagadish rishi ne kashipuri ke bagav rishi or unke 51 shishyon ko bulaane va apane rajya main rakhane kii baat kahi
 The king asked his special Diwan to visit Bagava Rishi with his family and 51 disciples and ask for a solution to stabilize King Anagpal's kingdom
 raja kaa khaas dewan kashipuri bagav rishi ke paas pahunchaa evam unhe sari baat bataai evam dilli chalakar nivas karne kii prarthana kii
 On the request of the King's special Diwan, the Baghavishi said that in 21 days there will be an Akhand Yagna, in which the nail of the all-metal metal of 21 fingers will remain in the earth till then the king's kingdom will remain immovable
 raja anangpal ke nimantran evam prarthana par bagav rishi apane kutumb evam 51 shishyon sahit margshirsh shukla doj, guruuvar vikram samvat 1199 ko ravaanaa hue va do mahine saat din baad dilli pahunche
 Raja Anagpal and Jagdish Rishi welcomed him outside Delhi city limits
 dilli pahunchakar bagav rishi va unke 51 shishyon nen baishakh shukla trayodashi, guruuvar, vikram samvat 1200 ko yajna prarambh kiya evam jyeshtha shukla teen, buudhvaar ko purna aahuti di evam 21 angul kii sarvadhatu kii keel yajna sthal par gaadi
 Baghav Rishi told the king that, o Rajan, this nail has gone into the head of Basik Nag
 ise kabhi bhi mat ukhaadnaa
 As long as this nail remains, your kingdom will also remain unbroken
 tab raja anangpal ne bagav rishi va unke shishyon ko apane vansh kaa dwitiya guru banaaya Baghav Rishi told the king that, o Rajan, this nail has been worn in the head of Basik Nag, do not ever break it
 jab tak yah keel rahegi tera rajya akhand rahegaa
 Then King Anangpal made Bagava Rishi and his disciples second guru of his dynasty and gave 52 villages to Guru Dakshina
 asarh krishna, navami, mangalvaar vikram sambat 1200 main bagav rishi va unke 51 shishy 'bagaur' naamak kshetra main pahunche evam ise hi apana nivas sthaan banaaya
 After this, he considered that taking and giving donations from the Brahmin's henchmen are the main task, so the total priests who took donations from themselves remained in Kashi
 us samay bagaur kshetra main chokhchand naam ke brahmbhat rahete the
 His rule was that of Katwalia sub-divisional Kataria Gautra Bhardwaj, who made him his total priest and donated lakhs of money
 udhar basik naag ke putr takshak naag ne basik naag ke sheesh main gaadi gayi keel ukhaadne kaa nishchay kiya
 Taking the form of Takshak Nag Brahmin reached Delhi with King Anangpal
 raja ne brahman rupi takshak naag ko pranaam kiya kapat rup dhaaran kiye takshak naag ne raja ko aashirvad diya or apni safed chadar tanakar usapar viraaja gaya
 The king thought that these were some rishi
 tab brahman bhesh dhare takshak naag ne prithvi par keel gade jane kaa kaaran poocha
 The king told that a 21-day Akhand Yajna was performed here, so this nail has been sung in the head of Basik Nag
 jab tak yah keel rahegi tab tak hamaara rajya rahegaa
 On this, Takshak Nag, a Brahmin, said, "king, you are also mad mad
 This 21 Angul keel is carved in the head of the Basik Nag, when the well, the Baawdi are dug deeper than that, then the Basik Snake does not come out
" agar yah baat sach he to is keel ko ukhada jaye, jo khun main bhari hui nikle to sach anyathaa jhunthi to he hi
 When the Brahmin Takshak Nag gave this proof to the king, the king got more confidence in him
 'vinaash kaale vipareet buddhi' raja ko brahman rupi takshak naag kii baat sahi lagi evam keel ko ukhdva diya tabhi 3 boond khun kii paddy or usee samay vah brahman rupi takshak naag gaayab ho gaya
 Then the king got the nail back and repented heavily
 usne apane kul guru bagav rishi ko bulawaaya or sara vrutant kah sunaaya
 Then the sage said that you can no longer be a kingdom
 'keel jo dhili hui, tanvar hua matiheen' satya he jo guru ke vachanon ko nahin maanata he uski yahi dasha hoti he
 When Raja Baghav fell at the feet of the sage, the sage said, “rajan! Now, by repenting, what has to happen, we live through it
 is par raja ne bagav rishi se aage kya kiya jaye yah baat poochi
 The sage said, Rajan, you have given us 52 villages in Guru Dakshina, you will go to those villages and rule and we will eat them with tenancy
 jis din aapke vansh kaa rajya hoga or hamaare vansh kaa guru hoga tab ham yah dakshina pun: praapt karenge
 Then the king said, Maharaj, what will be the identity of your dynasty, on this the total guru of the king, Baghav Rishi said that from today onwards the name of our dynasty will be 'bagda Brahmin' and we will neither become the guru of anyone nor make anyone a disciple
 tabhi se 'bagdh brahman' jati ki utpatti maani jaati he
 Over the years, the word Bagaud continued to be misplaced and today it is known as Bagda
 The Baghavishi sage gave King Anangpal the kingdom of Delhi to his daughter's son Prithviraj
 tab raja ke pratham guru bagav rishi se raja kii rajdhani ke bare main poocha
 Jagdish Rishi had a deep desire that the king should go to his village
 bagav rishi nen unke man kii baat jaanakar raja se kaha he rajan ! aap patan gaanv main jaakar rajdhani banaao or ham bhi ab bagaur gaanv main nahin rahenge
 Then King Anangpal summoned Prithviraj from Ajmer and Miti Vaishakh Shukla Chaturdashi ruled him in Vikram Sambat 1201 and King Anangpal himself went to Patan village
 bagaur gaanv main babood brahmanon ne 11 mahine 5 din rajya kiya evam miti jyeshtha krishna chaturdashi vikram sanwat 1201 ko gaanv chhodkar chal diye

 hathiyaar
 vah yoddha raja kahalaaya jaataa tha
 When he ascended the throne of Delhi, he built the fort Rai Pithora here
 His whole life is a series of constant courage, valor, humble and gentle behavior and great deeds

 Her love story with her enemy, Jaichand's daughter, Sanyogita, is very popular
 uske 'swayamvar' k din vah use lekar faraar hua tha
 He expanded his empire, during which Mohammad Ghori invaded India in 1191 and defeated it in the first battle of Tarain
 agle varsh, 1192 main, ghori sena prathviraj ko tarin ke duusare yuddh main chunauti dene laut ai
sultan mohammad shahab-ud-din ghori bharat ke taraf ek badi bal sankhya 120,000 ke saath bada
 
 jab vah lahore pahunchaa, usne apane doot ko prithviraj chouhan kaa samarpan kaa adhikaar maangane bheja, lekin prithviraj chouhan ne paalan karne se inkaar kiya
 Prithviraj Chauhan then asks his fellow Rajput chiefs for a formal assistance to help them against the Muslim invasion
 kareeb 150 rajput pramukhon ne uske anurodh main apni pratikriya vyakt kii
 Prithviraj also came with a large army, a large part of which included elephants for the Indian war, and with the hope of defeating Sultan Muhammad Shahab-ud-din Ghori at the Tarain, to defeat him again, where a year before
 He had tortured his opponent badly, Sultan Muhammed Ghori gave a final warning to Prithviraj that he should become a Muslim or lose
 Prithviraj proposed a protest that Muhammad should consider a ceasefire, allowing him to return with his army
 sultan mohammad shahab-ud-din ghori ne hamalaa karne kaa faisla kiya
 Ghori divided his troops into five parts and attacked the Rajput soldiers before daybreak, sending waves of archers mounted to attack the Rajput soldiers, but as the Rajput elephants moved forward
 shaam ke baad nahin ladane kaa rajput parampara kaa phayda uthaake usne rajput sena par hamalaa karke unhen haraaya
 iske baad kya hota he vahaan kaa sthaneey loksangit se spasht he jo abhi bhi rajasthan main pramukh he
 It is said that Prithviraj was taken to Afghanistan along with his royal poet-friend, Chandbhar
 ghori ke adaalat main, prithviraj or chandbar ko bandhan main laayaa gaya tha
 Prithviraj was asked to show the art of archery, in which he could just aim and listen by aiming
 ise shabdabhedi- baan bhi kaha jaataa he
 Ghori asked him to show this art
 To make the game interesting for himself, he pierced his eyes with hot iron metal
 Chandbhar says, "A king, even if a prisoner, can get orders from a king only
 isliye yah ek sammaan hoga agar aap use "nishaanaa lagane kaa aadesh de"
 tab vah kuch shloke yaa kavita kahata he, un panktiyon main se kuch the,"chaar bans choubees gaj, angul asht pramaan, taaoo par sultan he mat chuko chouhan
 "
 Four bamboo means four bamboo sticks, twenty four yards Lagbug 24 yards, Angal asht pravan means flour as wide as fingertips
 All this together tells us the place of sitting on the throne of Ghori i
e
 four bamboo high stick, 24 yards
 But the whole dough was sitting above the fingers
 "aage bado o chouhan or uddhesh chuknaa nahin"
 prithviraj is tarah ghori ko usike adaalat main martha he or spasht rup se apni maut ko daavat he
 Prithviraj Chauhan, the last ruler of the Chauhan dynasty to sit on the throne of Delhi, was born in 1165 as the son of King Someshwar Chauhan of Ajmer
 He was a very talented child and very quick to learn military skills
 sirf awaz ke aadhaar par lakshya ko maarane qi kushalta usame thi
 At the age of thirteen, in 1178, when his father died in battle he succeeded the Ajmer throne
 anangpal uski maan kaa pita, dilli ke shaasha, uski bahaduree or saahas ke bare main sunne ke baad use dilli ke singhaasana kaa uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya
 He once killed a lion on his own without any killing
 vah ek yoddha raja janaa jaataa tha
 When he ascended the throne of Delhi, he built Qila Rai Pithora here
 uskaa puraa jivan lagaataar saahas, veerta, sahruday karm or mahaan karnaamon kii ek satat shrankhla thi
 He defeated the mighty Bhimdev, the ruler of Gujarat, at the age of just thirteen
 apane dushman, jaichand qi beti, sanyogita ke saath uski prem kahani bahut prasidd he
 On the day of his "swayamvar" he escaped with her
 usne apana samrajya ko badhaaya, is dauraan mohammad ghori ne 1191 main bharat par akraman kiya or tarin ke pehle yuddh main use haraa diya
 The following year, in 1192, the Ghori army returned to challenge Prathviraj in the Second Battle of Tarain
 Sultan Muhammad Shahab-ud-din Ghori had a large force on the side of Ghoribharata with 120,000
 When he reached Wahlahor, he sent his envoy to Prithviraj Chauhan to demand the surrender, but Prithviraj Chauhan refused to obey him
 prithviraj chouhan tab apane sathirajput pramukhon ko muslim akraman ke khilaaf apane madad ke liye ek aupchaarik sahaayta kii maang rakhata he
 About 150 Rajput chiefs responded to his request
 prithviraj bhi ek badi sena ke saath aayaa tha, ek bada hissaa jisame bhartiya yudhhathiyaan shaamil or uske saath tarin main sultan mohammad shahab-ud-din ghori ko milane aage bada phir se haraane ke ummid ke saath, jahaan ek saal pehle usne apane virdohi ko buree tarah haraake ksht pahunchaaya tha, sultan muhammad ghori ne prithviraj ko ek antim chetavanee di kii vah muslim bane yaa haar jaye 
 prithviraj ne virodh main ek prastaav rakhaa ki mohammad yuddh viraam samajhe, use apane sena ke saath vaapasi qi anumati de
 Sultan muhammad-shahab-ud-din Ghorine decided to attack
 ghori ne apane sainikon ko paanch bhaagon main vibhaag kiya or rajput sainikon par din ke samay se pehle hamalaa kiya
 Armed horsemen sent waves of rajputs to attack the Rajput soldiers, but as the Rajput elephants moved back and forth
 shaam ke baad nahin ladane kaa rajput parampara kaa phayda uthaake usne rajput sena par hamalaa karke unhen haraa diya
 What happens next is evident from the local folk music which is still prominent in Rajasthan
 kaha jaataa he ki prithviraj ko unke raaj kavi sah dost, chandbar ke saath afghanistan le jaaya gaya tha
 In Ghori's court, Prithviraj and Chandbhar were brought into bondage
 prithviraj ko teerandaji kii kala dikhaane ke liye kaha gaya, jisamen vah uddeshy or dhwani sunakar bas nishaanaa laga saktaa he
 This word is also known by the name of bhabhedi-baan
 ghori ne is kala dikhaane ko use kaha
 khel ko khud ke liye dilachasp banane ke liye, vah apane aankhon ko garm lohe kii chadi se chhed karwaata he chandbar kehete hai, "ek raja, haalanki ek kaidi ke rup main, ek raja se hi aadesh praapt kar saktaa hai
 So it would be an honor if you would order him to "target
 Then he says some verses or verse, some of those lines were," Char bamboo twenty-four yards, angl ashta pravan, maar mara mote so muk na chouhan "
 Four bamboo means four arrow stick, twenty four yards approximately 24 yards, Angal ast praval means flour as long as fingers
 All this together Ghori represents the right place to sit on his throne i
e
 four bamboo stick height, 24 yards Wife was away and sat Ghori right up eight fingers
 "aage bado he chouhan or apana uddesh chuko mat"
 prithviraj is tarah ghori ko usike adaalat main martha he or spasht rup se apni khud kii maut se miltaa he
 Rajput states like Sarswati, Saamana, Koharam and Hansi were captured by Ghori without any difficulty and without any challenge he advanced to Ajmer
 Defeated followed Prithviraj to his capital where he was brought back to Afghanistan as a prisoner
 sultan muhammad -ghori ne prithviraj chouhan ke bete, cola, ko bakhsha jisane badale main ghori ke taraf vafadari kii shapath lee
 As a prisoner at Ghor, Prithviraj was brought in chains to Sultan Muhammad Ghori
 ghori prithviraj ko apni aankhe neeche jhukaane kii aadesh detaa he
 But Prithviraj denies him and says "the true Rajput bows his eyes when he dies"
 After hearing this, Ghori fires fire and orders his men to make Prithviraj blind with a red hot iron rod
 kuch samay baad ghori teerandaji pratiyogita kaa ek vyavastha karata he
 Then Chandra Bardi, who joined the Ghori kingdom as a poet, tells him that Prithviraj is a well-known archer who can hit his target after hearing a sound
 ghori ne vah maanane ko inkaar kiya
 He then ordered his man to bring Prithviraj to the competition
 lekin chandra bardi ne ghori ko kaha ki vah nishaanaa lagayegaa jab ghori use aadesh degaa
 Why was Ghori surprised, at my behest
 tab chandra bardy ne uttar diya ki vah ek raja he, or vah ek raja se hi aadesh legaa, uske rajdurbar ke sadasyon se nahin
 This will satisfy his ego
 vastav main ghoro ko maarane qi vah ek ranneeti thi jo chaand or prithviraj ne pehle se hi vichaar kiya tha
 And after killing Ghori, they also tried to attack each other
 uske baad prithviraj chouhan ko pratiyogita kshetra main laayaa gaya
 The moon was already there and gave more help to kill Ghori in the form of couplets which only Prithviraj could understand
 "chaar bhaash choubees gaj angul hast pramaan, t upar sultan he ab mat chuke chouhan"
jaise hi ghori ne prithviraj ko nishaanaa lagane kaa aadesh diya, usein apana kaman apane kaan tak khinchaa or ghori ko thik uske gale main maaraa
 maukey par hi ghori qi mrityu ho gayi
 Prithviraj shouted, "I have avenged my humiliation"
 And then the moon struck Prithviraj and Prithviraj attacked the moon, thus he would not be imprisoned again by the enemy
 or vir maut mare
 jaise sanyogita ko mahasoos hota he ki prithviraj mar rahaa he, vah bhi mar jaati he
 And all of us, all the lovely artists especially remember Prithviraj and Sanyogita

 They reached the mountains near the Himalayas in 1830, but Nepal was reluctant to let the British enter the country because Nepal feared political and possible invasion

 The British were forced to continue observation from the Terai, an area south of Nepal that is parallel to the Himalayas
 tej barsha or malaria ke kaaran tarai main sthiti bahut kathin thi: teen survey adhikari malaria ke kaaran maare gayi jabaki kharaab swasthya ke kaaran do ko avkaash mil gaya
 Nevertheless, in 1847, the British were compelled and began to observe in detail the Himalayan peaks from the observation station to 240 km
 mausam ne saal ke ant main kaam ko teen mahine tak roke rakhaa
 In November 1847, the British Surveyor General Andrew Waugh of India made a number of observations from the Sawaipur station which is situated at the eastern end of the Himalayas
 us samay kanchanajangha ko vishwa ki sabase unchi chotii maani gai or usne ruchipurvak note kiya ki, is ke peeche bhi lagbhag 230 kimi dur ek chotii he
 Jaune Armstrong, who was a co-officer of Vogue, also saw this peak in the far west from a place he called the peak 'B'
 vaug ne baad main likhaa ki avlokan darshata he ki chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha, lekin avlokan bahut dur se hua tha, satyaapan ke liye najadik se avlokan karnaa jaruri he
 In the coming year, Vogue sent a survey officer to observe peak 'B' in the Terai from the viewpoint, but the clouds stopped all efforts
 san 1849 main vaug ne vah kshetra james nicholson ko saunp diya
 Nicholson produced two observations from Girol 190 km away

 patna main uske kachche hisaab ne chotii ‘bi’ ki ausat oonchaai 9,200 me diya, lekin yah prakaash apvartan nahin samajha jaataa he, jo oonchaai ko galat bayaan karata he
 The number was clearly shown, although that peak was higher than 'B' Kanchenjunga
 yadhyapi, nicholson ko malaria ho gaya or use ghar laut jane ke liye vivash kiya gaya, hisaab-kitaab khatm nahin ho paaya
 Michael Hennessy, a subsidiary of Vogue, began assigning peaks based on Roman numbers, gave Kanchenjunga the IX name, and Choti 'B' the name XV

 san 1856 ke march main usne patr ke madhyam se kalakatta main apane pratinidhi ko apni khoj kaa puri tarah se udghosh kar diya
 The height of Kanchenjunga was clearly stated to be 28,156 feet, while the height of XV was stated
 vaug ne XV ke bare main nishkarsh nikaala ki “adhik sambhav he ki yah vishwa main sabase unchaa he”
 The peak XV was calculated to be 29,000 feet high, but it was publicly reported as 29,002 feet
