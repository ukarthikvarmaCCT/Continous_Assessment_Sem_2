 The meanings of Chandi in Sikhism are: aadi shakti hi vivek buddhi he, kyonki vivek buddhi aadi shakti main leen he
 According to Sikhism, all Satigur and devotees, including Guru Nanak Sahib, had meditated on Bhagoti
 guru gobind singh ji ne chaar rachanaayen kii jisame chandi ke anek gunon kaa vistaar kiya, chandi kaa arth agar kisi ne samajhnaa he to guru gobind singh ji kii bani iske arthon or ullekhan kii khan he
 Guru Sahib has written many names of Chandi such as Bhagoti, Kharag Dhara, Durga, Arrow, Kali, Tupak, Asa, Bhagoti, Devta, Khanda, Other Suta, Parvati, Jagbir, Jagamat, Para, Parbhi, Baad Bari, Kati, Katari Purnee, Halbi, Jwala, Arrow, Chanchala, Lal Naina, Teg Adik which have deep meanings in themselves

" arthath main us bhagoti kii simer rahan hoon jo nanak gur ke dhyaan main ai thi
 If the compositions and words of Guru Gobind Singh ji are evaluated, it seems clear that Guru Gobind Singh ji has described Chandi as "adi Shakti"

 If all these things are kept in mind, then it is not clear from anywhere that Guru Sahib has considered any Chandi as an idol, ironing or any substance
 chandi kii sari jang vivek buddhi or avivek buddhi kii jang he
 Where Vivek Buddhi is called "chandi" and describes it as an unintentional Buddhist monster
 daitya dharm ke vipareet hai, devate karm cond main vyast hai or chandi gurmukh he
 Guru Gobind Singh ji has also revealed the battle of the same way in the creation of Parasnath avatar

 While Gaur goes to high places in the rain, the same wild buffalo live around the fields in the plains and cause great damage to the fields
 is kaaran gaanv vaale unka shikaar kar dete hai
 There is also a reason that the natural forests have been destroyed and replaced by trees like teak, sal, eucalyptus which meet the urban needs
 inamen se kuch ke pattey akhaadya he, inke neeche vah ghaas nahin ug paati jinako ye khate he, vaise bhi junglee bhainse bahut chuninda bhojan karti he
 Due to this also their conflict with the villagers has increased a lot
 takaraav badhane kaa ek kaaran yah bhi he, ki pehle adivasee berwa paddati se kheti karte the
 They did not have to work very hard in this
 jangal ke tukade jala kar uname bina hal chalaaye beej chhidak diye jate the
 The ash was a very good fertilizer
 paidaavaar bhi bahut acchhee mil jaati thi
 Apart from this, Kandamul and Phal were also found in abundance in the forests
 yada kada kiye jane vaale shikaar se bhi unhe bhojan kii kami nahin hoti thi
 They were not completely dependent on farming
 isaliye vanya praaniyon dwaara fasal main se kuch hissaa kha liye jane par iname bair bhav nahin aata tha
 And because of changing the place every two or three years, the grasslands used to become grasslands in the back
 vanya praaniyon ko chaare kii koi kami nahin hoti thi
 Therefore, their number of occasional hunts did not decrease
 ab chunki adivaasiyon ke paas sthai khet hai, jinaki urvartaa uttarottar kam hoti jaati he
 And plowing in them has to be done like weeding and applying fertilizer, which takes a lot of labor and money
 iske alaava kheton kii gheraabandi ke liye baans-balli or anya van utpaada lene kii ijaajat bhi nahin he, atah ab adivasee apni fasalon ke nuksaan par vanya praaniyon ke jaani dushman ho jate hai
 Due to all these reasons, wild buffaloes have come under the category of rarest animals today
 khayr yah sab ho chukaa he or is nuksaan kii bharpai karnaa hamaare bas main nahin he
 But there is one place which is untouched by the destruction of development till date
 vah jagah aaj bhi thik waisi he jaisaa prakruti ne use karodo saalon ke vikaas kram se banaaya he, jahaan aaj bhi berwa paddati se kheti hoti he or jahaan aaj bhi van bhainsa bade jhundo main shaan se vichrata dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan badi sankhya main baagh, bhaaluu, dhol, pahari maina or anek anya jaanavar shanti se apana apana jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 Where thousands of species of vegetation, trees and plants, many of which have become extinct from the rest of India, are flourishing
 kareeb 5000 varg kilometre ke is swarg kaa naam he abujhmaad
 There are neither smoke-blowing factories nor mines blowing dust, nor are there roads through which destruction can reach here
 par yah sab kuch badalane vaala he or kuch to badal bhi chukaa he
 The so-called comrades of the tribals living here are holding guns
 hajaaro saalon tak swarg rahi is dharti par in swayambhu kamredon ne baroodon ke dher laga diye hai
 These people have laid such landmines on this picturesque land, which the security forces cannot differentiate between tribals and wildlife
 or sabase bade khed kii baat to yah he, ki jin yojanaon kaa dar dikhaa kar inhone adivaasiyon ko bhadkaaya tha, hamaari sarkaar aaj unheen ko lagu karne ja rahi he
 Mines are being allocated here without reaching Abujmad and without conducting any study
 or hamaare vanshajon kii is dharohar ko isaliye nahin barabaad kiya jaayegaa, ki desh main louh ayask kii koi kami he, balki is ayask ko niryaat karke pehle hi dhan kuber ban chuke khadaanapatiyon kaa laalach ab sari simaaen tod chukaa he or ve itane taqatvar ho chuke hai, ki ab ve netaaon ke nahin balki netaa unke ishaaron par naachte he
 Wildlife and tribals have no value in their eyes
 prakritik asantulan, global varming, nadiyon kaa pani viheen hona or akaal jaise shabdon kaa inase koi vaasta nahin
 As long as any place in the world is worth living, then they will have enough money to live happily
 inhi karatuuton se hamaare in jangalon main bachi hui junglee bhainson kii aabaadi bhi nasht ho jaayegi

 Vedantasar is the last text of the tradition of Vedanta, the author of which is Sadanand Yogi
 isaki rachana 16veen shatabdi main hui thi
 Vedantasara paves the way for easy entry into the principles of Vedanta
 is drushti se yah sarvaadhik lokapriy rachana he
 The author of Vedantasar is Sadanand Yogindra Saraswati
 inke shishy krishnanand saraswati the jinke shishy nrisingh saraswati ne veydantsaar ke upar 'subodhini' naamak tikaa likhi thi
 The time of writing of Subodhini is Saka Samvat 1510 ie 1588 AD
 atah sadanand avashya hi is tithi ke purv hue honge
 Sadananda took place after 1386 AD and before 1588 AD
 sadanand ke mangalacharan se prakat hota he ki unke guru adwayanand saraswati the
 Sadanand himself was also honored with the title 'saraswati'
 yah oopaadhi shankar-veydant ke sanyasiyon kii das oopaadhiyon main se ek sammanit oopaadhi he
 Among the ascetics honored with this title were scholars like Madhusudanasaraswati, author of Advaitasiddhi and Brahmanandasaraswati, author of Brahmanandiyam
 sadanand swayan bhi atyant vidvan the
 Through his Vedantasara we get admission into the famous masters of advaita-vedanta, eg Gaudapada, Shankar, Padmapada, Hastamalak, Suresvaracharya, Vachaspatimishra, Sriharsha and Vidyaranya
 in sabhi ke sandarbh hamen veydantsaar main praapt hote hai
 Therefore, it is certain that Sadanand must have studied the works of all these masters
 isse adhik kuch veydantkaar ke rachayita ke vishay main gyaat nahin hota
 The author of Vedantasara has taken shelter of almost all the earlier major Advaita Vedanta texts in the writing of his book
 inke ashrith granthon main sarvapramukh hai, shankaracharya kaa sharirakabhashya jinke siddhanton ke aadhaar par iskaa mul dhaancha khadaa he
 The Upanishads have also been sheltered from where numerous quotations of Shruti-proof have been given
 iske atirikt anya veydant manishiyon ke uddhran bhi bahulata se diye hai
 advaita-vedanta is a deep subject in itself
 advait-veydant ke aacharyon kii ek lambi parampara he jinhone veydant ke siddhanton kaa vikaas kar usko ek samrudh darshan kaa rup diya he
 It is not an easy task to enter into the principles of these masters
 veydantsaar ke rachayita ne is kathin kaary ko sugam kar dikhaaya he
 We find a coordinated, cogent and simple form of the principles of advaita-vedanta in Vedantasara
 style kii dashshti se bhi veydantsaar ek saral tathaa sampusht granth he
 After reading the works of many Vedant masters, the reader is lost in their waggon
 veydantsaar main aisa kuch nahin he
 The author has spoken only of the relevant subject in a very simple style
 vishay tathaa style donon drushtiyon se sugam hone ke kaaran veydantsaar advait-veydant ke siddhanton ko grahan karne ke liye praveshdwar kaa kaary karata he
 In the words of Baldev Upadhyaya, "'vedantasara can be said to be the initial sequence of reading Vedanta due to its simple interpretation
 '" The author himself has narrated a case-book to Vedantasar - 'asya Vedantprakaranaa tadiyairvanubandhaittattattasiddharan te Prithgalochaniyaah
 ’ The definition of the case is given as follows: - is paribhaasha ke anusaar ‘prakaran’ sampoorn shaastra ke vishay se sambaddh na hokar uske kisi vishisht vishay se sambaddh hona chahie
 When the word 'case' comes in the meaning of a part of the book, it is always the same, but when it is used in the meaning of free text, we do not always get the same topic of scripture in it
 kuch prakaran to avashya aise paye jate hai jahaan shaastra ke ek hi vishay kaa nirupan he, jaise shankaracharyakrit ‘panchikarnaprakriya’, kintu adhikansh prakaran-granth aise hai jinamein shaastra ke sampoorn vishyon kaa sankshep main vivechan he
 Such are the scriptures of Saptaparthi, logic, logic etc
 veydant ke bhi veydantaparibhaasha, veydantsaar aadi granth isi prakaar ke hai
 In Vedantasara we get a brief representation of all the subjects of advaita-vedanta, in the same sense it can be called a case-book

 There is a class of Kshatriyas called Haihayavanshi Samaj, this society still exists today

 Parashuram killed this king and his sons and grandchildren and had to fight for it 21 times
 koun tha sahatrarjun ?: sahatrarjun ek chandravanshi raja tha jiske purvaj the mahishmant
 Mahishmant had established a city called Mahishmati on the banks of Narmada

 Kritavirya's son's name was also Arjuna
 kritaviry kaa putr hone ke kaaran hi unhen karttaviryarjun bhi kaha jaataa he
 Kartaviryaarjuna pleased Lord Dattatreya with his worship
 bhagwaan dattatreya ne yuddh ke samay karttaviryajun ko hajaar haathon kaa bal praapt karne kaa vardaan diya tha, jiske kaaran unhen sahatrarjun yaa sahasrabahu kaha jane laga
 Ravana was also frightened by Sahastrajun's might
 yuddh kaa kaaran: rishi vashishtha se shaap kaa bhaajan banane ke kaaran sahatrarjun kii mati maari gai thi
 Sahastrajun saw a Kapila Kamadhenu cow in the ashram of Parasurama's father, Jamadagni, and longing to get it, he forcefully took Kamdhenu from the ashram
 jab parashuram ko yah baat pataa chali to unhone pita ke sammaan ke khatir kamdhenu waapas laane kii sochi or sahatrarjun se unhone yuddh kiya
 In the battle, all the arms of Sahastrajun were cut and he was killed
 tab sahatrarjun ke putron ne pratishodhavash parashuram kii anupasthiti main unke pita jamadagni ko maar daalaa
 Parshuram's mother Renuka got distracted by her husband's murder and sati entered her funeral pyre
 is ghor ghatana ne parashuram ko krodhit kar diya or unhone sankalp liya-"main haihay vansh ke sabhi kshatriyon kaa naash karke hi dam loonga"
 He then fought the Haihayavanshi Kshatriyas of egotistical and evil nature 21 times

 But as a boon of death by his father, Parashurama could not defeat him
 parashuram apane jivan bhar kii kamai brahmanon ko daan kar rahe the, tab dronacharya unke paas pahunche
 But unfortunately they had donated everything by then
 tab parashuram ne dayabhav se droncharya se koi bhi astr-shastr chunane ke liye kaha
 Then the clever Dronacharya said that i want all your weapons including their mantras so that they can be used whenever they are needed
 parashuramji ne kaha-"evamastu!" arthath aisa hi ho
 With this, Dronacharya became proficient in weapons education
 parashuram karn ke bhi guru the
 He also taught various types of weapons to Karna and taught him to operate Brahmastra
 lekin karn ek soot kaa putr tha, phir bhi yah jaanate hue ki parashuram keval brahmanon ko hi apni vidha daan karte hai, karn ne chal karke parashuram se vidha lene kaa prayaas kiya
 Parashurama taught him a lot of scholars by considering him a Brahmin, but one day while Parashurama was sleeping with a head in the dock of Karna under a tree, a bumblebee came to bite at Karna's feet, so that there was no obstruction in his Guru's sleep
 That's why Karna bared the bunny, the bunny was severely biting Karna's leg, due to the biting of the bunny, Karna started bleeding
 wo khun bahata hua parashuram ke pairon tak ja pahunchaa
 Parashuram's sleep opened and he immediately recognized the blood that this blood could only belong to a Kshatriya who kept flowing for so long without being oozed
 is ghatana ke kaaran karn ko apni astr vidya kaa laabh nahin mil paaya
 According to another legend, Guru Parshuram was once sleeping with a thigh on Karna's head
 tabhi ek bichchhu kahin se aayaa or karn kii jangha par ghaav banane laga
 But the Guru's rest is not disturbed, so Karna endured the scorpion sting

 Excluding metals, ores, industrial and other useful minerals from the womb of the earth are miners or mining
 aadhunik yug main khanijon tathaa dhaatuon kii khapat itani adhik ho gai he ki prati varsh unki aavashyaktaa karodon ton kii hoti he
 The need for large mines to meet this consumption was progressively felt
 falswaroop khanikarm ne vistrut ejiniyaron kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he
 This is called mining engineering
 sansar ke anek deshon main, jinamein bharat bhi ek he, khanikarm bahut pracheen samay se hi prachlit he
 In fact, consumption of metals and other minerals was very low in the ancient era, so only small mines were sufficient
 us samay ye khaane 100 foot kii gaharaai se adhik nahin jaati thim
 It was impossible to mine below where water used to come out; At that time there were no modern equipments like pumps etc
 kisi bhi prakaar ke khananavikas ke liye khanan ke purv kii do avasthaaen -- purvekshan tathaa gaveshna bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Prospecting includes exploration of minerals and ores, general study of deposits and possibilities of mining
 in tathyon kii jaankaree ke liye kin sadhano kii sahaayta lee jaay, yah us kshetra kii aavashyakaataaon par nirbhar karata he
 The scope and area of the potential deposits under the exploratory work, their average thickness, the potential quantity and value of the mineral, the distribution of the mineable areas under the deposits, the conditions for opening, developing and mining the mine and suitable for the development of the mine Important facts are included in the decision of the law
 gaveshna ke teen mukhya ang hai : taleey gaveshna, vedhan tathaa bhumigat gaveshna
 The miners are mainly divided into three parts: is prakaar ke khanan main dharaatal ke upar jo pahaad aadi hai unako todakar khanij praapt kiye jaat hai, jaise chooney kaa pathar, baaluu kaa pathar, granite, louh ayask aadi
 The main task in this method is to break the stone
 shilaayein kathorta, majbootee tathaa dridhtaa main bhinn hoti hai
 The rocks are soft, there is no difficulty in breaking them
 aisi shilaon ke udhaaharan jipsom, chini mitti, selkhadi aadi hai
 The rocks in which metals are found are extremely hard, such as granite, diorite, etc
 in shilaon ko visphotak padaarthon dwaara todaa jaataa hai
 The methods of mining were extremely unsuitable in the ancient and medieval ages
 dhire dhire khanan vidhiyon kaa vikaas hua or unamem barood aadi kaa upyog hone laga
 In the past century, a variety of unjustifiable explosive substances such as dynamite, gelignite, nitroglycerin, etc
 have developed
 khanan main visphotak padaarthon kaa upyog karne ke liye pehle shilaon main chhidr banaaya jaataa he tathaa usamen ye visphotak jo kaartoos ke rup main milte hai, rakh die jate hai or vidyutddhara yaa fus lagaakar unamem aag laga di jaati hai
 The stone crumbles with the explosion
 phir inako dhan aadi se todakar or chota kar liya jaataa he, jisase unhen hataane main suvidha ho
 Various types of boreholes like jack hammer are used to make holes in the stones
 ye yantra sampeedit vaayu athwa kisi drav eendhan dwaara sanchalit hote hai
 The depth of holes is 3-4 feet and diameter is from 1-1 / 2 inch to 2 1 / 2 inch
 kabhi kabhi shilaatal par aise bahut se chhidr kar die jate he or sab main visphotak kaartoos bhar die jate hai tathaa vidyut dwaara sabhi ko ek saath hi jala diya jaataa he, isse puure kaa puraa pahaad tut jaataa he
 Examples of this type of surface mining in India are limestone and iron ore etc
 pattharon ke hataane ke liye badi khaanon main rail kii patariyaan bichhaakar thelon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Mechanical spines have also proved very useful in this work
 ye khurpe un pattharon ko uthaakar bade trakon main bhar dete hai
 The cost of this type of mining in India varies from Rs 5 to Rs 9-10 per ton
 taleey khanan main 40-50 foot tak gaharaai ke pathar nikaale jate hai
 The method of extracting ore and minerals by mining from open pits is used in the mining of copper, iron, coal, limestone and other industrial minerals
 kuch anshon tak yah vidhi sone, chaandi, jaste tathaa sise ke khanan main bhi sahaayak siddh hui hai
 In this type of mining, huge excavator and loading of ore or mineral out of the mine is the main
 khudaai ke liye shaktishaalee yantric khurpon kaa prayog hota he
 They fill pieces of stones blown by hoofs into trucks or wagons
 kam duuri ke liye khanan gadiyon, dibbon tathaa trakon se kaam chal jaataa he or adhik duuri ke liye baari trakon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jo laden hue pattharon ko swachaalit dhang se kisi ek sthaan par ikattha kar dete hai
 The topography of the area is mapped before mining as uncovered minerals and then the thickness of deposit and available quantity of mineral are determined by trenches, test pits and drilling
 pani ke nikaas kii dashaon par bhi saavdhaanee se vichaar kiya jaataa he
 At the commencement of the mining operation, the first step is to remove the soil located on the deposits
 kabhi kabhi badi khaanon ko kholane ke liye mitti hataane main 2-3 varsh tak lag jate hai
 Mining work starts from the peak and flat benches are cut one after another until the foothills are reached
 aajkal aadhunik boring yantron ke avishkaar ke falswaroop 25-30 foot tak motaai kii benchen kaatna saral ho gaya hai
 Arrangements are made for the arrival of light trucks and pads on iron tracks above these benches
 saadharantaya bench banane ke liye shilaon main kai chhidr kiye jate he tathaa visphot karne ke liye lachakeeli visphotak topicaon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 One pound of explosive material can break 4 to 15 tons of rocks
 yah maatra shilaon kii dridhtaa par nirbhar karti he
 The system of mining in the form of open mines in India is mainly used on a large scale for limestone etc
 jin khaanon se cement utpaadan ke liye chuunaa pathar nikaala jaataa he, vahaan 2000 ton tak kaa dainik utpaadan asaamaanya nahin samajha jaataa
 This method is also used in iron ore mining in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa etc
 anya ayskon tathaa khanijon ke atirikt is prakaar kii khanan pranali koyale ke liye bhi vahaan prayukt kii ja sakati he jahaan koyale ke staron kii gaharaai adhik na ho
 Thus even if the thickness of the soil level is more than ten times the thickness of the coal level, this type of mining is considered economically appropriate
 kuch pracheen nadiyon main jo avsaad ekatrit hue hai unamem kabhi kabhi bahumoolya dhaatuen bhi nikshipt ho jaati he
 Obtaining metals by breaking these sediments comes under this type of mining
 kabhi bhi ye dhaatuen nadi kii talahati main milti hai or kai baar inamen sone jaisi bahumoolya dhaatuen paryaapt maatra main mil jaati hai
 In some cases these depressions are also covered by other new depressions
 tab unhen hataakar dhaatuon kii prapti kii jaati he
 Under special circumstances these metals have also been observed to be collected in compressed rocks
 prakshalan nikshapon ke khanan main vishesh rup se ise prayukt kiya jaataa he
 These rocks are made of feces and their particles also vary in size
 prakshalan nikshapon ke pramukh upyogi khanij sona, tin, platinum tathaa viral mittiyaan hai
 The percentage of these metals in rocks is very less
 is vidhi main unche dabaav par pani bade veg ke saath nazal se nikalataa he or shila par takaraata he
 As a result of the collision of water, the rock breaks and breaks into microscopic particles
 pani kii dhara ke saath ye kan aage chal dete hai, jahaan pani sloos baxon jinamein baadhak platen lagi rahati hai, pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 Heavy metals accumulate near the baffle plates and the water flows through the metal plates carrying the separated rock
 jalopha khanan vidhi main pramukh aavashyaktaa vishaal maatra main jal kii hoti he
 Water pressure can range from 50 to 600 feet
 khanan kaa mulya bhi kam hota he, kyonki isamen pani se utpann shakti ke atirikt anya kisi shakti kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 In this way, the measured substances are measured in cubic yards
 bade nikshepon ke khanan main yantric sadhano kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he tathaa kabhi kabhi is vidhi se 30 foot motaai ke nikshepon tak kaa khanan hota he
 Alluvial mining is not in practice in India; In some areas gold is obtained by filtering sand and washing it
 bihar main swarnarekha nadi ke tat par rahanevaale nivasee isi prakaar sone kii prapti kiya karte he
 Another method of alluvial mining also uses a special type of mechanical boats
 in naukaaon main ghoomanevaali baltiyon kii vyavastha rahati he, jo talahati se baaluu ko kharonchkar naav par laa detii hai
 Along with this sand many abrasive minerals also come, which are separated by the above method
 burma or malaya ke tin kshetron ke prakshapaalan nikshepon ke khanan main yahi vidhi prayukt kii gai he
 The power requirement and cost of money are also considerable in this mining
 ye naukaaye 20 foot kii gaharaai tak kii baaluu kharonch sakati hai
 The buckets used in these range from 1 1 / 2 to 14 cubic feet
 un anek prakaar ke khanijon tathaa ayskon ke utkhanan main bhumigat khanan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he jinka khuli hui khaanon ke rup main khanan, gaharaai par sthit hone ke kaaran, aarthik drushti se anupyukt athwa asambhav hota he
 Although underground mining also requires huge capital, there is no other option for mining these deposits
 bhumigat nikshep do prakaar ke ho sakate hai : The nature of these two types of deposits is very different, so their methods of mining also vary according to convenience
 khaanon main kaary aarambh hone se pehle purvekshan tathaa gaveshnatmak kaaryon ko saavdhaanee se samaapt kar liya jaataa he
 After this, the development work of the mine starts
 sarvapratham coop banaae jate hai
 They can be up to 10-12 feet in diameter
 yadi nikshepon kii gairai kam hoti he to pravankon kaa hi nirmaan kar liya jaataa he
 If required, underground passages and galleries are also made, the stones through which the well is cut, if they are not strong, then lining of steel, cement etc
 is also required
 bhumigat khanan main kupon kaa bada mahatv he, kyonki karmchaariyon kaa khan main aana janaa, khanit padaarthon kaa baahar aana, vaayu kaa sanchaalan tathaa khan se pani baahar phenkane ke liye panpon kaa sthaapan inhen se sanchalit hota he
 Any mine must have at least two wells
 khanijon tathaa ayskon ko todane main fawde, kudali tathaa sabbal athwa yantron yaa visphotak padaarthon kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 Efforts are made to extract maximum amount of mineral
 kintu isse khan main shilaon kaa santulan bigadane lagata he
 It depends on the flexibility and strength of the rocks to some extent
 khan main shilaon kaa santulan bigadane se bachaane ke liye khan kii deevaaron tathaa chat ko sahare kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For this, at the level at which work is going on, pillars are left and minerals are extracted from the surroundings
 kintu isamen khanij kii kaaphi maatra kaa hraas hota he
 Therefore, nowadays the effort is made that sand or any other material should be filled in the empty places and the minerals of those columns should also be removed
 yah vidhi adhikansh bhartiya koyala khaanon main prayukt hoti he
 In addition, wood, iron, concrete, stone, brick, etc
 are also used
 khanij padaarth ko khan se upar laane ke liye pinjade ke aakaar kaa jhula, ispaat ke rasse tathaa vinding ingine kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Inside the mines, trolleys are used to bring the mineral from one place to another, which mostly runs on iron tracks
 coop se hokar khan ke karmchaaree bhi khan main inhen jhulon se utarate hai
 Stairs are also used in some mines, such as in asbestos mines in Kodarma
 bhumigat khaanon main upyukt prakaash tathaa shuddh vaayu ke avaagaman kaa prabandh atyant aavashyak he
 Most mines now have electric light
 abhrak aadi kii khaanon main mombatiyaan bhi prayukt hoti he
 For the movement of air, the airways should be large and the natural flow of air should not stop
 kuch sthitiyon main iske liye kuch yantric sadhano kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 These instruments handle pure air in the mine
 khan main coop khodate samay, athwa jalpatal aa jane par, pani kaa prakritik pravaah prarambh ho jaataa he
 This water is taken to a place by making a drain and from there the pump is taken out of the mine
 bhumigat khaanon main durghatnaayen bhi badi bhayaavanee hoti hai
 Fire is a major problem in them
 aag kii durghatnaayen vishakt gaison ke achaanak visphot se, visphotak padaarthon ke madhyam se yaa kisi anya karanvash ho sakati hai
 Fire extinguishing in coal mines is very complex
 jharia kshetra kii kuch khaanon main varshon se aag lagi hui hai, kintu abhi tak unako bujhaayaa nahin ja sakaa he
 Some accidents are caused by the sitting of the mine or by sudden flooding of water
 abhi gat 27 disambar 1975 ko dhanbad se 27 kilometre dur sthit chasanala koyala khan ke 80 foot upar sthit pani ke ek vishaal hauj main aksmaat 8
35 meter chhed ho gaya or pani badi teji ke saath bharne laga
 As a result, all the 372 laborers working inside the mine at that time were trapped inside the mine and could not be removed in any way
 is durghatnaayen se pehle 1973 main jitpur main 40 majdoor mar gaye the
 238 laborers died in the accident at the Purari mine in Hazaribagh
 1958 main chanakuti main ek durghatana hui thi jisamen 176 log mare the
 As a result of the modern development of mining engineering, all kinds of efforts are made to minimize these accidents and all other problems
 durghatana kii sthiti main aaptkaaleen khanan sainya dal, jo purna rup se susajjit rahata he, dhan or jan kii raksha main apurv sahyog detaa he
 Every mining area has centers for this service
 chasanala kii durghatana main pani ke nikaas ke liye anek deshon ne pampadi yantra bhejkar sahaayta kii
 The governments of the countries make laws to keep the work of the mines running smoothly
 in kanoonon main karmchaariyon kii suraksha unke swasthya, khanan main upyukt vidhiyon kaa upyog tathaa anya sambandhit vishay rahete hai
 For the welfare of workers, schemes are being implemented in every country and also in India for a long time, so that their means of happiness, convenience and safety are increased
 2024 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 2024 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
