 In the late 18th century, a philosopher named D
 Trouille, describing the meteorite that fell at the location of Alberto in Italy, conceived the idea that it must have come in the form of a star bursting from the mantle, but no one paid attention to it
 san 1768 i
 main fadar basile ne france main luus naamak sthaan par ek ulkapind ko prithvi par aate hue swat: dekha
 The following year he read an article on this account in the session of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris
 academi ne vrittant par vishwaas na karte hue ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye ek ayog niyukt kiya jiske prativedan main fadar basile ke vrittant ko bhramaatmak bataate hue yah mantavya prakat kiya gaya ki bijli gir jane se pind kaa prishth kuch is prakaar kaanch sadrush ho gaya tha jisase basile ko yah bhram hua ki yah pind prithvi kaa ansh nahin hai
 Later, the German philosopher Claudney, studying a meteorite from Siberia in 1794, proposed the theory that the bodies are representative of the mantle
 yadhyapi is baar bhi yah vichaar turant sweekaar nahin kiya gaya, phir bhi cladni ko is prasang par dhyaan aakarshith karne kaa shrey mila or tab se vaigyanik is vishay par adhik manoyog dene lage
 In 1803, there was a huge rainstorm of meteorites at La Aigil location in France, in which countless small and big stones fell and often two or three thousand of them could be collected
 vigyaan kii francisi academi ne us vrishti kii puri chaanbin kii or ant main kisi ko bhi yah andeh nahin rahaa ki ulkapind vastut: khamandal se hi prithvi par aate hai
 The main classification of meteorites is based on their organization
 kuch pind adhikanshat: lohe, nikal yaa mishradhaatuon se bane hote hai or kuch silicket khanijon se bane pathar sadrush hote hai
 The first class is called metallic and the second class is called meteoric meteorite
 iske atirikt kuch pindon main dhatvik or aashmik padaarth praaia: samaan maatra main paae jate hai, unhen dhatvashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In fact, meteorites of all kinds of intercastes are found between completely metallic and completely wondrous invertebrates, which often makes it difficult to decide the class of bodies
 sanrachana ke aadhaar par teenon virgo main upbhed kiye jate hai
 There are two main strains in the heavenly bodies, one is called chondrite and the other is acoundrite
 pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa mukhya lakshan yah he ki unamem kuch vishisht vrittakar dane, jinhen kaundrul kehete hai, upasthit rahete hai
 Ponds in which the tendrils are not present are called achondrites
 dhatvik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upbhed hai jinhen kramash: ashtani or shashthanik kehete hai
 These names express the inner structure of the bodies and, as these names express, the bonds of metallic material in the first differential objects are configured in the octagonal shape and in the second in the crystalline shape
 is prakaar kii rachana ko vidamanstator kehete hai evam yah pindon ke marjeet prishth par badi sugamawa se pahachaani ja sakati he
 There are also two main subclasses in the metaphysical meteorites, which are called palacite and semi-metaphysical
 inamen se pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa aashmik ang mukhyat: aulivin khanij se bana hota he jiske sfat praaia: vrittakar hote hai or jo louh-nikal dhaatuon ke ek tantra main samaavrutt rahete hai
 Semi-metallic meteorites mainly contain pyroxene and small amounts of anorthite feldspars
 purv prakaran main yah ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki dhatvik or aashmik angon kii pradhanta ke aadhaar par ulkapind vargeekrut kiye jate hai
 But there does not seem to be any definite basis for the distribution of chemical elements and minerals in these bodies
 ulkapindon ke teen mukhya virgon ke atirikt anekanek upvarg hai jinamein se prayek kaa apana pruthak vishesh khanij samudaay he
 So far, 25 new classes have been detected and often one new subclass is being detected every two years
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki adhyayan ke liye uplabdh padaarth atyant alp maatra main hote hai
 So far the presence of only 52 chemical elements in meteorites has been certified, whose names are as follows: 
 Oxygen
 gandhak
 Platinum
 loha 
 argon gallium
 Phosphorus vung arsenic jarmenium barium vanadium Indium zirconium beryllium
 silicon 
 iridium
 Titanium
 manganeez sizium 
 antimony telurium meganecium sirium 
 aluminium
 Copper molybdenum sis 
 Carbon Thulium Yeshad
 sodium Cadmium
 nitrogen rajat scandium 
 calcium
 Out
 ruthenium swarna 
 coblt paarad rubidium straunsium 
 chromium
 Palladium

 Hydrogen 
 Chlorine
 potacium lithium
 Helium in 52 tatwon main se keval aath prachur maatra main paae jate hai, jinamein haalon sabase pramukh he
 The other seven are sequentially Oxygen, Silicon, Manganese, Sulfur, Aluminum, Nickel and Calcium
 inke atirikt 20 anya tatv paryaapt maatra main paae jate hai tathaa unki upasthiti kaa pataa saadhaaran rasinic vishleshan dwaara 1926 se purv hi lag chukaa tha
 The remaining 24 elements are present in very small quantities and their presence has been proved by spectral analysis
 khanij sanrachana kii drushti se ulkapindon or prithvi main pai gai shail raashiyon ke lakshanon main kai antar hote hai
 Generally, iron and nickel are very rare in independent metallic forms in global rock deposits, but in meteorites, metals are found in abundance in pure form, and often indispensably
 iske atirikt kai aise khanij hai jo bhumadleey shailon main nahin paae jate, par ulkapindon main milte hai
 Chief among these are Oldemite and Schreiberite
 ye donon khanij nami or oxigen kii bahulata main sthaayee nahin hote or isi kaaran bhumandaleey shailon main nahin milte
 Their presence suggests that the meteorites originated in an environment where the conditions of oxidation were lower than on the planet
 aashmik ulkapindon main saadharantaya piroxin or aulivin kii prachurtaa evam felsapaar kaa abhaav hota he, jisase unka sanghathan bhumandal kii atibhasmik shailon ke sadrush hota he
 The subject of the origin of meteorites is very controversial
 is vishay par anek mat samay samay par prastaavit hue hai, jinamein se kuch main inhen prithvi, chandramaa, surya or dhoomaketu aadi kaa ansh mana gaya he
 According to a very popular belief, they originated from a planet which is completely destroyed now
 is vichaar main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki aadi main praaia: mangal ke aakaar kaa ek grah rahaa hoga jo kisi duusare bade grah ke atyant sameep aa jane par, athwa kisi duusare grah se takaraakar, vinasht ho gaya, jisase arabon kii sankhya main chote bade khand bane jo ulka rup main khamandal main vichar rahe hai
 According to this view, the metallic meteors represent the central part of the fictitious planet and the astounding meteors represent the upper surface
 yadhyapi is upakalpana se ulkapindon ke anek lakshanon kii vyakhya ho jaati he, phir bhi anek baaten anbujhi paheli rah jaati hai
 For example, some metallic meteorites have an octahedral structure that is usually destroyed at 800 ° C
 aisa vishwaas he ki us kalpit grah ke vikhandan ke samay avashya hi usamen adhik taap utpann hua hoga
 Still, it is not understood how this octagonal composition survived
 isi prakaar yah shankaa bhi bani rahati he ki akundrite aashmik ulka main loha kahan se aayaa or kaundrite aashmik ulka main kaunduul kaise bane
 In another opinion, it has been proposed that meteorites originated with the planets, or rather, that the solar system and all cosmic matter originated from meteorites
 is kalpana ke anusaar aadi vishwa ulkapindon se paripurna tha ev kalantar main ve pind vibhinn punjon main ekatrit hote gaye tathaa unke adhikadhik ghanikaran ke krmanusaar gasamay noharika, nakshatra evam grah utpann hue
 a major error of this imagination seems to be that meteorites present in the mantle are so dispersed and their mutual attraction is so weak that it will take too much time to collect and form a large amount
 kintu isamen koi andeh nahin ki ek baar paryaapt bade aakaar kii raashi ban jane ke baad vah apni satta banaae rakh sakegaa or kalantar main or adhik pindon ko apane main milakar apane aakaar kii vruddhi bhi kar sakegaa
 It is possible to partially modify the above methods to determine their actual method of origin
 ulkapindon kaa ek brihat sangrah kalkatte ke bhartiya sangrahalay ke bhuvaigyanik vibhaag main pradarshit he
 It is supervised by the Geological Survey of India

 Until a few years ago, scientists could not detect its microscopic symmetry, it is far from being a model! Evidence suggests that it was built as a tomb by the fourth dynasty of Egyptian ruler Khofu around 2560 BC
 ise banane main kareeb 23 saal lage
 Questions have often been raised about this great pyramid of Egypt, how the Egyptians, without machines, without modern tools, drove the huge stone blocks 450 feet high and completed this huge project in just 23 years? Pyramid penetrator Evan Haddington calculated that if this happened, dozens of workers would have to place a stone block every other minute for 10 hours of work every day for 365 days of the year
 kya aisa sambhav tha? vishaal shramashakti ke alaava kya pracheen misravasiyon ko sookshm ganitiya or khagoleey gyaan rahaa hoga? visheshgyon ke mutabik pyramid ke baahar pashaan khandon ko itani kushalta se taraasha or feet kiya gaya he ki jodon main ek blade bhi nahin ghusaayi ja sakati

 Its three rulers were known for their disloyalty, ruthlessness and authority over the South Indian Hindu states
 khalji vansh ke pehle sultan jilaluddin firoz khalji, gulam vansh ke antim kamazor badshaah kumarsh ke patan ke baad ek kuleen gut ke sahyog se gaddi par baithe
 Jalaludden was much older in age and was considered so unpopular at the time as an Afghan clan that he could not dare to venture into the capital

 Juna Khan assumed the title of Alauddin Khalji and ruled for 20 years
 unhone ranthambhore, chittod or mandu par qabza kiya or devgiri ke samrudh hindu rajya ko apane rajya main mila liya
 He also gave a befitting reply to the Mongol invasion

 Who was Khilji? There is substantial controversy in this subject
 itihaaskaar 'nizamuddin ahamed' ne kilji ko changez khaan kaa damaad or kuleen khaan kaa vanshaj, 'barani' ne use turkon se alag evam 'fakhruddin' ne khilgiyon ko turkon kii 64 jatiyon main se ek bataaya he
 Fakhruddin's view has been supported by most scholars
 chunki bharat aane se purv hi yah jati afghanistan ke helemand nadi ke tateey kshetron ke un bhaagon main rahati thi, jise kilji ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Probably that is why this caste was called Khilji
 maamluk athwa ghulaam vansh ke antim sultan shamsuddin kumors kii hatya ke baad hi jilaluddin firoj kilji singhaasana par baitha tha, isliye itihaas main kilji vansh kii sthapana ko kilji kranti ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The Khilji revolution is not only important because it ended the Ghulam dynasty and established the new Khilji dynasty, but it is also important that the Khilji revolution resulted in the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate to the south
 jatvaad main kami ai or saath hi yah dharna bhi khatm hui ki, shashan keval vishishti varg kaa vyakti hi kar saktaa he
 Khilji belonged mainly to the proletariat
 kilji yug samrajyavad or muslim shakti ke vistaar kaa yug tha
 After this revolution the sphere of influence of the Turkish wealthy chieftains decreased
 is kranti ne prashasan main dharm va ulema ke mahatva ko bhi asweekaar kar diya
 Thus the power of the Khilji rulers depended mainly on power
 khilgiyon ne yah siddh kar diya ki, rajya bina dharm kii sahaayta se na keval jivit rakhaa ja saktaa he, balki safaltaapurvak chalaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Jalaluddin Khilji's handling of the throne marks the end of the Mamluk dynasty and the domination of the Ottoman slave elite
