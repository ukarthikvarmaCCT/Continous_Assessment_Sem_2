 Thalassemia is a genetically inherited blood disease of children
 is rog ke hone par sharir kii haemoglobin nirmaan prakriya main gadabadi ho jaati he jiske kaaran raktakshinata ke lakshan prakat hote hai
 It is identified only after the age of three months
 isamen rogi bachche ke sharir main rakt kii baari kami hone lagati he jiske kaaran use baar-baar bahari khun chadhaane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There are two types of thalassemia
 yadi paidaa hone vaale bachche ke mata-pita donon ke genes main miner thelacemia hota he, to bachche main major thelacemia ho saktaa he, jo kaaphi ghaatak ho saktaa he
 But there is no danger to any child if there is minor thalassemia in one of the parents
 yadi mata-pita donon ko miner rog he tab bhi bachche ko yah rog hone ke 25 pratishat sambhaavna he
 
 atah yah atyaavashyak he ki vivaah se pehle mahila-purush donon apni jaanch kara len
 According to the World Health Organization, every year seven to ten thousand children suffering from thalassemia are born in India
 keval dilli va rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main hi yah sankhya kareeb 1500 he
 Thalassemia accounts for 3
4 percent of the total population of India
 england main keval 360 bachche is rog ke shikaar hai, jabaki pakistan main 1 lakh or bharat main kareeb 10 lakh bachche is rog se grasit hai
 There is no cure for this disease at the moment
 haemoglobin do tarah ke protein se banataa he alpha globin or beta globin
 Thalassemia results from a malfunction in the globin formation process in these proteins
 jiske kaaran laal rakt koshikaayen teji se nasht hoti he
 Due to the acute lack of blood, the blood has to be transfused repeatedly in the patient's body
 rakt kii kami se haemoglobin nahin ban paata he evam baar-baar rakt chadhaane ke kaaran rogi ke sharir main atirikt louh tatv jamaa hone lagata he, jo hriday, yakrut or fefdon main pahunchakar pranaghatak hota he
 The disease is mainly divided into two categories: yah beemaari un bacchon main hone kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, jinke mata-pita donon ke genes main thilicemia hota he
 Which is called thalassemia major
 thilicemia miner un bacchon ko hota he, jinhen prabhavit jin mata-pita donon main se kisi ek se praapt hota he
 As far as the investigation of the disease is concerned, at the time of blood examination on the microscope instrument, the disease can be captured by the reduction in the number of red blood particles and the change in their size
 purna raktakan gananaa yani sibisi se raktaalpata yaa anemia kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 Another test, called hemoglobin electrophoresis, detects abnormal hemoglobin
 iske alaava muteshan analysis test ke dwaara alpha thalicemia kii jaanch ke bare main janaa ja saktaa he
 a spinal cord transplant also helps in the treatment of this disease
 suukhta cheharaa, lagaataar biimaar rahanaa, vajan naa aandhanaa or isi tarah ke kai lakshan bacchon main thelacemia rog hone par dikhaai dete hai
 Treatment of Thalassemia sufferers requires considerable external blood transfusion and medicines
 is kaaran sabhi iskaa ilaaj nahin karvaa pate, jisase 12 se 15 varsh kii aayu main bacchon kii mrity ho jaati he
 With the right treatment, one is expected to live 25 years and above
 jaise-jaise aayu badhati jaati he, rakt kii jarurat bhi badhati jaati he
 To motivate the pre-marriage check-up, a health chart has been created, which the bride and groom should get along with their birth chart
 swasthya kundali main kuch jaanch kii jaati he, jisase shaadi ke bandhan main bandhane vaale jode yah jaan saken ki unka swasthya ek duusare ke anukool he yaa nahin
 Thalassemia will be the first investigation under the health horoscope
 echivi, hepatitis bi or si
 Apart from this, their blood will also be compared and RH factor in blood will also be examined
 is prakaar ke rogiyon ke liye kitni hi santhaayen rakt prabandh karaati hai
 Apart from this, many blood donors are eager gentlemen
 thilacemia par vishwa bhar main shodh anusandhan anwarat jari hai
 It was through these efforts that a drug for thalassemia victims was invented
 is dawaai se bacchon ko ab injection ke dard ko nahin jhelana padegaa
 Soon this medicine is going to come in the Indian market, which will only control the iron content in the body
 asuraan naam kii yah dawa pashchimi deshon main eks jed naam se pehle se hi prayog ho rahi he
 This will also reduce the cost of treatment, but among its side effects, there is a percent risk of kidney damage
 dilli ke gangaaraam aspataal ke thilicemia ikai ke adhyaksh dow virend khanna ke anusaar bharat main atirikt louh nikaalane ke liye do tareeke prachlan main hai
 In the first method, iron is extracted from desorol for eight to ten hours
 yah prakriya bahut mahangi or kshtdaayak hoti he
 An injection used in it costs Rs 164
 is prakriya main har saal pachaas hajaar se dedh lakh rupye tak kharch aata he
 In the second process, a medicine called calfer is given
 yah dawa sasti to he lekin iskaa istemaal karne vaale 30 pratishat rogiyon ko jodon main dard kii samasya ho jaati he
 Also, one percent of these children are prone to serious diseases
 aise main nai dawa asuraan kaafii laabhadaayak hogi
 This drug is mixed with fruit juice and is given at Rs 100 per dose
 thilacemia ke liye stem cell se upachaar kii bhi sambhaavnaaen hai
 Apart from this, Bonamarro Donor Registry has now been opened in India for spinal cord transplant of patients of this disease
 maro donor registry india main bonmaro daan karne waalon ke bare main sabhi aavashyak jaankariyaan hogi jisase desh ke hi nahin varan videsh se ilaaj ke liye bharat aane vaale rogiyon kaa bhi aasaani se upachaar ho sakegaa
 The center will be set up in Mumbai
 aise centre vartmaan main keval america, britain or canada jaise desho main hi the
 Patients with leukemia and thalassemia will now be able to contact the center to obtain bone marrow or stem cells, information about donors of the spinal cord, as well as information on their blood and saliva samples

 piech yaa ph, kisi vilyan kii amlata yaa ksharakta kaa ek maap he
 It is defined as the co-logarithm of the activity of liquefied hydrogen ions
 hydrogen aayan ke gatividhi gunank ko prayogtmak rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he, isliye ve saidhantik gananaa par aadhaarit hote hai
 ph scale is not a fixed scale; It is concerned with a set of standard solutions whose ph is assessed by international contracts
 ph kii avadharana ko sabase pehle 1909 main carlsburg laboretry ke danish rasayanashastri, soren pedar luritz sorensen ne prastut kiya tha
 It is still unknown what the exact definition of p is
 kuch sandarbhon se pataa chalata he ki p, "power" kaa pratik he or anya ise german shabd "potenz" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai or abhi bhi anya ise "potential" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai
 Jens Norby published a paper in 2000 in which he argued that p is a constant and a symbol of "negative logarithm"; Which is also used in other works
 H, hydrogen kaa pratik he
 Sorensen suggested a "PH" signal for convenience that symbolized the "power of Hydrogen" using the co-logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution, p
 yadhyapi is paribhaasha kaa adhikraman kar diya gaya he
 If an electrode is calibrated with a solution of known hydrogen ion concentrations, p can be measured
 shuddh jal ko tatasth mana jaataa he
 25 ° c But the ph of pure water is around 7
0
 7 se kam ph vaale solution ko amleey kaha jaataa he or 7 se adhik ph vaale solution ko ksharkeey yaa kshareey kaha jaataa he
 Measurement of ph has great importance in medicine, biology, chemistry, food science, environmental science, oceanography and many other applications
 ph ko ek jaleey solution main hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke dashamalav laghuganak ke ghataav ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Due to its logarithmic nature characteristic, ph is a dimensionless quantity
 jahaan a H, hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi he
 The reason for this definition is that a h is a property of a single ion that can only be measured experimentally with the help of an ion-selective electrode that reacts with the activity of a hydrogen ion according to the Nernst equation
 ph ko saadharantah ek sanyukt glass electrode kii sahaayta se mapa jaataa he jo hydrogen ke aayan kii gatividhi ke prati samvedansheel ek electrode or ek calomel electrode yaa ek silver chloride electrode jaise kisi riference electrode ke bich ke potential antar yaa electromotive bal, E, ko maapta he
 The combined glass electrode ideally follows the Nernst equation: jahaan E, ek mapa gaya potential he or e 0, maanak electrode potential arthath maanak avasthaa kaa electrode potential he jisamen gatividhi bhi ek he
 r is the gas constant; t is the Kelvin temperature; f is a Faraday constant and n is an example of the number of electrons transferred
 electrode potential, E, hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke laghuganak kaa samaanupati hota he
 This definition is completely impractical in itself because the activity, concentrations, and activity coefficients of hydrogen ions are the product
 hydrogen aayan ke ekal-aayan kii gatividhi kaa gunank, ek aisi quantity he jise prayogtmak rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he
 To get rid of this difficulty, the electrode is calibrated in relation to the solution of known activity
 ph kii sankriyaatmak paribhaasha ko aadhikarik rup main international standard ISO 31-8 ne nimna rup main paribhaashit kiya he: solution x ke liye, galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e x ko mapa jaataa he | Concentrated Solution of kcl || Solution x | H2 | Pt and then the electromotive force of a galvanic cell, ES, is also measured which is different from the above by substituting solution X, ph of unknown ph by solution s of known standard ph
 tab X, kaa ph hota he The difference between the ph of the solution x and the ph of the standard solution depends only on the difference between the two measured potentials
 is prakaar, ph ko ek potential se praapt kiya jaataa he jise ek electrode ke saath mapa jaataa he jo ek yaa ek se adhik ph maanakon ke vipareet anshakit hota he; ek ph meter setting ko is prakaar se samyojit kiya jaataa he ki maanak ke solution kii meter kaa pathan, ph maan ke baraabar hota he
 The ph values of a range of standard solutions S, along with further detailed information, are indicated in the IUPAC recommendation
 maanak solution ko praayah maanak bafer solution ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, it is better to use two or more standard buffers to allow for small deviations from the normality of Nernst's law in real electrodes
 dhyaan den ki chunki taapmaana, paribhaashit karne vaale samikarnon main paaya jaataa he, isliye solution kaa ph, taapmaana-aadhaarit hota he
 Special procedures are required to measure very low ph values, such as some very acidic mine waters
 aise maamalon main electrode kaa anshankan, sandrit salphurik acid maanak solution ke saath kiya ja saktaa he jiske ph maanon kii gananaa, gatividhi gunankon kii gananaa karne ke liye pitzar maapdandon kaa prayog karke kii ja sakati he
 ph is an example of an acidity function
