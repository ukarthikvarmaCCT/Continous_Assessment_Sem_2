 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km
 m Radius of the earth and 9 mm of the earth It can turn into black hole when inside
 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr kaa dravyaman kisi gurutveey apurvata) par kendrit rah saktaa he, yah ek bindu, ek challa, ek prakaash kiran, yaa ek sphier ho saktaa he; vartmaan main iske vishay main thik thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly
 haalaanki, aasapaas ke paryaavaran par uske guruttviya prabhaav dwaara uski upasthiti kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, khaas kar microkvasar or sakriya gallexic nabhikon dwaara, jahaan paas ke kalenidr main girane vaale padaarth ati garam ho jate hai or eks-re vikiran kii badi maatra chhodte hai
 This observation method enables astronomers to ascertain their existence
 kalenidr ekmaatr aise padaarth hai jo in paimaanon par khare utarate hai or saamaanya saapekshata ke dhaanche ke anuroop hote hai
 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are visible from outside the black hole
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
 ek baar koi kan ghatana kshitij ke andar aa jaye, uskaa blike hole ke bheetar janaa avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 For a spectator standing far away, the clocks near the black hole would seem to move more slowly
 is prabhaav ke kaaran, dur khadaa darshak yah dekhegaa ki blike hole main girane vaali koi vastu uske ghatana kshitij ke nikat aane par dhimi ho jaati he, us tak pahunchne ke liye anant samay leti hui prathit hoti he
 At the same time all the actions of this object slow down, resulting in the light appearing more red and dim, this effect is called gravitational red shift
 ant main, girane vaali vastu itani maddham ho jaati he ki dikhaai dena band ho jaati he, ek bindu par ghatana kshitij par pahunchne se thik pehle
 The Schwarzschild radius limits non-spherical event horizons for non-rotating black holes
 ek vastu kii schvarjaschild trigya dravyaman ke anupaat main hoti he
 Circled black holes have a distorted, nonspherical event horizon
 chunki ghatana kshitij ek bhautik sataha nahin he balki keval ek ganitiya paribhaashit seemaa he, padaarth yaa vikiran ko blike hole main pravesh karne se rokane vaala kuch bhi nahin he, keval baahar nikalne se inako roka jaataa he
 The description given by general relativity for black holes is an approximation and it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important from near the event horizon
 yah, blike hole ke ghatana kshitij ke nikat padaarth ke prekshan ko, saamaanya saapekshata or uske prastaavit vistaaron ke adhyayan ko sambhav banaata he
 Although black holes themselves do not radiate energy, electromagnetic radiation and matter particles can radiate from outside the event horizon, via Hawking radiation
 singhulerity blike hole ke centre main hoti he, jahaan padaarth main dabane ke kaaran anant ghanatv ho jaataa he, gurutvkarshan khinchaav anant shaktishaalee hota he or antariksh-samay main anant vikruti hoti he
 This means the mass of a black hole is completely compressed into a region with zero volume
 blike hole ke centre main is shunya-aaytan, anant rup se saghan kshetra ko gurutveey singhulerity kaha jaataa he
 The singularity of a non-rotating black hole is zero in length, width, and height; The singularity of a rotating black hole is ring-shaped and is located on the plane of rotation
 challe main koi motaai nahin hoti isliye koi aaytan nahin hota
 The presence of singularity in general relativity is generally considered an indication of the principle not being applied
 haalaanki yah apekshit he; yah aisi paristhiti main ghatit hota he jahaan kwantum yantric prabhaavon ko inkaa varnan karnaa chahie tha, ati ucch ghanatv or kan sahabhaagitaaon ke kaaran
 Until now it has not been possible to combine the effects of quantum and gravity in one theory
 aam taur par ummid kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv ke siddhant main singulerity rahit blike hole honge
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness where the photons will be trapped in a circular orbit, moving along the tangent of the sphere
 anavarti blike hole ke liye, photone sphere kii trigya schvarjaschild trigya kii 1
5 guna hoti he
 These orbits are dynamically unstable, so any small disturbance will also grow larger over time and either throw it beyond the black hole or push it within the event horizon
 haalaanki prakaash abhi bhi photone sphere ke andar se batch saktaa he, koi prakaash jo andar kii or jaati prakshepan path se photone kshetra ko paar karti he us par blike hole kaa kabja ho jaayegaa
 Therefore any light that reaches an audience standing outside from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by an object outside the photon sphere but beyond the event horizon
 neutron taron jaisi anya compact vastuon main bhi photone sphere ho sakate hai
 This is based on the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, so an object that is smaller than 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius would actually have a photon sphere corresponding to the object's mass
 chakrit blike hole chaaron taraf se argosphior namak ek antariksh-samay kshetra se ghira hota he jisamen sthir khada hona asambhav he
 This is the result of a process called frame-dragging; General relativity predicts that any rotating mass will try to stretch the space-time around itself
 chakrit drabyaman ke paas kii koi bhi vastu chakra kii disha main ghoomana shuru kar degi
 For a rotating black hole, its impact becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction just to stand still
 ek blike hole kaa argosphior nimnlikhit se ghira hota he: Within the ergosphere, space-time is drawn at a greater speed than light - in general relativity physical objects are forbidden to move faster than light, but space-time zones allow them to be compared to other space-time regions i can walk faster than light
 vasteen or vikiran, centre main gire bina argosphior ke bheetar kaksha main rah sakati hai
 But they cannot hover, because this would require them to travel faster than light backwards, compared to their own space-time zone, which is moving faster than light compared to an outside viewer
 vasteen or vikiran bhi argosphior se batch kar nikal sakate hai
 In fact, the Penrose process predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the agosphere, for this they will gain energy by "stealing" some of the black hole's energy
 agar vastuon ke kul drabyaman kaa bada bhaag is tarah batch nikalataa he, blike hole kii ghoomane kii gati or dhimi pad jaayegi or antat shaayad ghoomana band bhi ho jaye | The fascinating image of the black hole is bound to raise the question of whether such bizarre objects actually exist, or are they merely imaginary solutions to the Einstein equations
 oinstin kii swayan kr yah galat dharna thi ki blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki patan kii ore agrasar kanon kii koniya gati unki chaal ko sthirataa pradaan karegi
 Because of this, the general relativity community continued to dismiss its opposing results for many years
 lekin unamem se kuch is vishwaas par kaayam rahe ki blike hole kaa astitv vastav main he, or 1960 ke dashak ke ant tak ve adhikansh shodhakartaaon ko yah vishwaas dilaane main safal rahe ki ghatana kshitij kaa nirmaan vaaki main sambhav he
 Once upon a time, Roger Penrose proved that there must be some form of syngularity within him
 iske kuch hi samay pashchaat, stephen hawking ne yah darshaya ki big baing ke kai brahmadia samaadhaanon main singulerity kaa astitv he, scaler kshetron or anya videshi padaarthon kii anupasthiti main 
 The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical characteristics of a black hole are simple and easily understandable, making them respected research subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki blike holon ke nirmaan kii praathmik prakriya taron jaisi baari vastuon kaa guruttviya patan rahi hogi, lekin kai anya prakriyaayein bhi hai jo blike hole ke nirmaan kii taraf le ja sakati hai
 Gravitational collapse occurs when the internal pressure of an object is insufficient to resist its own gravity
 taron main yah aamtaur par isliye hota he kyonki yaa to taron main apane taapmaana ko banaae rakhane ke liye "eendhan" aparyaapt he, yaa ek tara jo sthir tha use dher saare atirikt padaarth mili parantu uske crod kaa taapmaana nahin badhaa
 In both cases, star temperature would prove insufficient to prevent its collapse under its own weight
 is patan ko taare ke ghatakon ke aapjatya dabaav dwaara roka ja saktaa he, padaarth ek aakarshak ghani avasthaa main sanghanit ho jaataa he
 As a result, a type of compact star
 What type of compact star will form will depend on the mass of the residue - after changes due to the collapse, the residuals have destroyed the outer surfaces
 note karen ki yah mul taare se kaaphi kam hoga- 5 se adhik saura drabyaman vaale avasheshon kaa utpaadan aise taron se hota he jinka dravyaman patan se pehle 20 se adhik rahaa hoga
 If the mass of the residue exceeds ~ 3-4 solar masses - because the original star was either too heavy or the residue has collected additional mass) - the neutron's inelastic pressure is also insufficient to prevent collapse
 iske baad aisi koi gyaat prakriya nahin he jo is patan ko roak sake or vastu patit ho kar blike hole main tabdeel ho jaayegi
 This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is attributed to the formation of most stellar mass black holes
 gurutveey patan ke liye bahut adhik ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the current age of the universe, this high density is found only in stars, but in the early universe the density was much higher soon after the Big Bang, which may have made the creation of black holes possible
 ucch ghanatv akele ek blike hole ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki drabyaman kaa samaan vitaran, drabyaman ko ikattha hone kii anumati nahin degaa
 For the formation of ancient black holes in this dense medium, it is necessary to have initial cubic disturbances that can later grow under the influence of their own gravity
 praarambhik brahmad ke vibhinn modelon main in gadbadiyon ke aakaar ke bare main vyapak matbhed he
 Various models predicted the creation of black holes, ranging from Planck masses to hundreds of thousands of solar masses
 atah aadim blike hole kisi bhi prakaar ke blike hole ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that can create a black hole
 siddhant rup main, blike hole kaa nirmaan ucch urja takkaron main bhi sambhav he jo paryaapt ghanatv paidaa karti hai
 However, so far, no such phenomenon has been detected, either directly or indirectly, as a lack of oscillating equilibrium in particle accelerator experiments
 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki blike hole ke dravyaman ke liye ek nichali seemaa honi chahie
 Theoretically, this limit should be around the Planck mass, where it is expected that quantum effects would prove the theory of general relativity to be false
 is kaaran prithvi yaa uske aas paas blike hole ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko bilkul nakaara ja saktaa he
 However, some developments in quantum gravity suggest that the limit of this bond may be considerably lower
 udahaaran ke liye, kuch brinworld paridrishy plank dravyaman ko kaaphi neeche rakhte hai, shaayad 1 tev / c2 itnaa neeche tak
 This may allow the creation of microscopic black holes in high-energy collisions or large Hadron colliders of the CERN
 haalaanki ye saare siddhant kaaphi kaalpanik hai or kai vaigyaniko kaa mat he ki in prakriyaaon main blike hole kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he
 Black holes, once formed, continue to develop by absorption of additional substances
 saare blike hole antartaarkeey dhul or sarvyaapee vikiran ko lagaataar avashoshit karte rahenge, lekin inamen se kisi bhi prakriya kaa ek taarakeey blike hole ke dravyaman par koi khaas prabhaav nahin padataa he
 More significant contributions occur when a black hole is formed in a binary star system

 Extremely large contributions occur when a black hole merges with other stars or compact objects

 The same process has also been proposed to form some intermediate-mass black holes
 jaise jaise ek vastu ghatana kshitij kii taraf babbti he, kshitij phoolnaa aarambh kar detaa he or lapak kar usko nigal letaa he
 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of the radius is evenly distributed throughout the hole
 1974 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki blike hole puri tarah se kaale nahin hai, balki ye thodi maatra main tapiya vikiran bhi nikaalte hai
 They found this result using quantum field theory in a stable black hole background
 unke samikarnon kaa parinaam yah he ki ek blike hole ko kanon ko ek adarsh blike body spectrum main chhodana chahie
 This effect became known as Hawking radiation
 hawking parinaam ke baad se, kaiyon nen vibhinn tareekon ke madhyam se is prabhaav ko satyapit kiya he
 If this theory of black hole radiation is correct, then it is expected that the black holes will remove the thermal beam of radiation and this will cause the mass to decay, since according to the theory of relativity, the mass is just the high condensed energy
 Over time, black holes will shrink and fly in the air
 is kiranpunj kaa taapmaana blike hole ke satahi gurutvkarshanake anupatik rahata he, jo badale main dravyaman ke liye vipareet rup main anupaatik rahata he
 Hence larger black holes emit less radiation than smaller black holes
 5 saura drabyaman vaale ek taarakeey blike hole kaa hawking taapmaana kareeb 12 nanokelvins hota he
 This is much lower than the 2
7K produced by the space micro-wave background
 taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike hole hawking vikiran ke madhyam se jitna drabyaman chhodte hai usase adhik dravyaman ve cosmik microwave prishthbhumi se praapt kar lete hai, atah ve sikudne kii bajaay failte jate hai
 To achieve Hawking temperatures higher than 2
7 K, a black hole would have to be lighter than the Moon
 duusari taraf yadi ek blike hole bahut chota he, ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa vikiran kaa prabhaav bahut shaktishaalee ho jaayegaa
 a black hole that is even heavier than humans will vanish in a moment
 ek car ke vajan vaala blike hole ko vashpit hone ke liye maatr ek nanosecond kaa samay hi lagegaa, is dauraan kuch kshanon ke liye isaki chamak surya se 200 guna se bhi adhik ho jaayegi
 Light black holes are expected to evaporate even faster, for example a black hole with 1 tev / c 2 mass will take less than 10–88 seconds to completely disappear
 beshak, itane chote blike hole ke liye kwantum gurutv prabhaav se ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kii jaati he or yahan tak ki – haalaanki kwantum gurutv main hue haal ke vikaas is ore koi sanket nahin karte hai – parikaalpanik taur par aise chote blike hole sthir honge
 The presence of most accretion disks and gas jets is not a clear evidence of the presence of stellar mass black holes, as other more massless and very dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can cause and create accretion disks and gas currents
 The behavior is the same as that around a black hole
 lekin ve aksar khagolavidon kii yah batalaakar madad kar sakati hai ki kis jagah blike hole kii talash faldaayi siddh ho sakati he
 But on the other hand, supermassive accretion disks and gas currents can be a good proof of the presence of a highly soluble black hole, because as far as we know, only one black hole can be the cause of these phenomena
 sthir eks-re or gamma kiran utsarjan bhi kisi blike hole kii maujuudagi sabit nahin karte hai, lekin khagolavidon ko yah bataa sakate hai ki kahan khoj karnaa faldaayi hoga- or inaki ye khubi hoti he ki ve kaaphi aasaani se nabulai or gas ke badalon se nikal pate hai
 But powerful, irregular X-rays, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation can help prove that that massive, super-dense object is not a black hole, so that the "black hole hunter" is focused on another object Can do
 neutron taron or anya ati saghan taron par satahen hoti hai or padaarthon kaa prakaash kii gati ke ek ucch pratishat par sataha ke saath takaraav, aniyamit antaraalon par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa utsarjan karata he
 The black hole has no solid surface, so the absence of intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals around a very densely compact object indicates that there may be a good chance of a black hole
 gahan parantu ek hi baar gamma kiran kaa nikalnaa kisi "nae" blike hole ke janm kaa sanket ho saktaa he, kyonki khagol-bhautikavidon kaa vichaar he ki grbs kaa kaaran yaa to kisi vishaal taare kaa gurutveey patan he athwa neutron taron ke bich takaraav, or in donon ghatnaon main blike hole kaa srijan karne hetu paryaapt drabyaman or dabaav shaamil hota he
 But it appears that a collision between a neutron star and a black hole can also produce a GRB, so a GRB is not evidence that a "new" black hole has formed
 sabhi gyaat GRB hamaari apni akashganga ke baahar se aate hai or adhikansh arabon prakaash varshon kii dur se aate hai isliye inase jude blike hole vastav main arabon varsh puraane hai
 Some space-physicists believe that some super bright X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kasaar atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii abhivruddhi discs hai, kyonki ab tak gyaat koi bhi vastu itani shaktishaalee nahin he jo itnaa shaktishaalee utsarzan kar sake
 Quasars produce powerful emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including UV, X-rays and gamma-rays, and are also visible from a considerable distance due to their high brightness
 5 se 25 pratishat ke bich kasaar "radio laud" hote hai, yah sangya inke shaktishaalee radio utsarjan ke kaaran he
 a gravitational lens is formed when rays of light coming from a far away bright source are "twisted" around a giant object, between the viewer and the source object
 This process is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of general relativity theory
 is siddhant ke anusaar, drabyaman gurutvkarshan kshetron ko banane ke liye antariksh-samay ko "samete" rahata he or isliye parinamswaroop prakaash ko mode detaa he
 The image of the source behind the lens can appear to an observer as multiple images
 yadi strot, baari lencing vastu or paryvekshak ek sidhi rekha main hon, strot baari vastu ke peeche ek challe ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 Gravitational lensing can also be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very powerful gravitational field has the ability to bend light rays
 in bahu chhaviyon vaale prabhaavon main se kuch, sambhawatah sudur sthit akashgangaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Objects orbiting a black hole continue to explore the gravitational field surrounding the central object
 1970 ke dashak main khoja gaya, ek purana udhaaharan he, ek prasiddh eksre strot signs X-1 ke liye jimmedaar kalpit blike hole ke ird-gird parikrama karti abhivruddhi discs
 Although the matter itself cannot be seen directly, the flickering of the x-ray continues in milliseconds, as expected just before accretion from a hot mass-like material orbiting around a black hole of about ten solar masses
 Is performed
 eksre spectrum us vishisht aakaar ko darshata he jisaki apeksha us discs se kii jaati he jisamen aurbiting relativistic padaarth hon, ek louh rekha ke saath or jise ~6

 Another example is the S2 star which is seen orbiting the celestial center
 yah tara ~ 3
5 × 106 saura drabyaman vaale blike hole se kai prakaash ghanton kii duuri par he, isliye isaki parikraman gati ko ankit kiya ja saktaa he
 Nothing is visible in the center of the supervised orbit, as would be expected from a black object
 ardh-aavadhik dolan kaa istamaal blike hole ke dravyaman kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique uses the relationship between the black hole and the inner part of its surrounding disks, where the gas continues to rotate inward before reaching the event horizon
 jaise hi gas kaa patan bheetar kii ore hota he, yah eksre vikiran prasaarit karata he jisaki tivrata ek nishchit kram se kam-zyada hoti rahati he or jo ek niyamit antaraal par khud ko doharaata rahata he
 This indicator is called half-period oscillation or QPO
 ek QPO kii aavriti blike hole ke dravyaman par nirbhar karti he; chote blike hole main ghatana kshitij nikat hi sthit hota he, isliye QPO kii aavriti ucch hoti he
 For black holes with greater mass, the event horizon is farther outward, so the QPO frequency is lower
 ab yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek akashganga ke, yaa lagbhag prayek, centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole hota he
 The close correlation between the mass of this black hole and the rise of the host galaxy indicates that there is a deep correlation between the formation of the galaxy and the black hole
 dashakon tak, khagolavidon ne "sakriy akashganga" shabd kaa istemaal aisi akashgangaon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jinamein asaamaanya visheshtaayen hoti thi, jaise ki asaamaanya varnakrameey rekha utsarjan or ati shaktishaalee radio utsarjan
 However, theoretical and observational studies show that the galactic nuclei active in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes
 in AGN ke modelon main ek kendriya blike hole hota he jo ki suraj se lakhon yaa arabon guna adhik baari ho saktaa he; ek gas or dhul kii discs jise abhivruddhi discs kehete hai; or do dharaaen jo abhivruddhi discs ke lambavat hoti hai
 Although it is expected that supermassive black holes will be found in almost all agns, the nuclei of only a few galaxies have been carefully studied in an effort to both identify and measure the actual mass of central supermassive black hole candidates
 Can be done
 aisi kuch ullekhneey akashgangaon ke udhaaharan hai, andromeda akashganga, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, or sombrero akashganga
 Astronomers believe that a supermassive black hole is located in the center of our own galaxy, in an area called Segitarius a *, because: 2002 main, habbal antarikshawya doorabeen ne jo avlokan prastut kiya ve sanket karte hai ki M15 or G1 naamak golakaar samoohon main madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole ke hone kii sambhaavna he
 This interpretation is based on the size and duration of the orbit of stars in spherical clusters
 lekin habbal saboot nirnaayak nahin he, kyonki neutron taron kaa ek samooh is tarah ke avlokanon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Until recent discoveries, many astronomers thought that complex gravitational interactions in spherical clusters would expel newly formed black holes
 november 2004 main, khagolavidon kii ek team ne hamaari akashganga ke pratham or purnatah satyapit madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, jo segiterius A* se 3 prakaash varsh dur parikrama kar rahaa he
 This black hole, with a mass of 1300 solar masses, is in the middle of a group of seven stars, possibly a remnant of a massive star cluster that has fallen from the center of the Ganges
 yah avlokan is baat kii pushti karata he ki ati vishalkay blike hole aasapaas ke chote blike holon or taron ke avasorana dwaara apni vruddhi karte he
 In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported the discovery of a black hole, possibly containing 10 solar masses and located in a galaxy called NGC 4472, at a distance of about 55 million light years
 hamaari akashganga main kai sambhavit taarakeey-dravyaman vaale blike hole shaamil hai, jo sagiterius A* kshetra ke ati vishalkay blike hole kii tulana main hamase adhik najadik hai
 All of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which a more dense object draws substances from its partner through an accretion disk
 in jodon main blike hole teen se lekar ek darjan se zyada saura dravyamanon ke ho sakate hai
 The hitherto observable stellar mass black hole, Messia is a member of the binary system located in 33 galaxies
 siddhanthata ek blike hole ke liye koi nunatam aakaar tay nahin he
 Once they are created, they have the properties of black holes
 stephen hawking ne pratipaadit kiya ki atipraarambhik blike hole vashpit ho kar or bhi sookshm ho sakate hai, arthath sookshm blike hole
 The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is being proposed for the discovery of a supermassive black hole that evaporates, which was launched on 11 June 2008
 haalaanki, agar sookshm blike hole kaa nirmaan duusare tareekon se ho saktaa he, jaise ki antarikshawya kiran ke prabhaav se yaa coliders main, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen nishchit rup se vashpit ho janaa chahie
 The formation of analogs of black holes in particle accelerators on Earth is reported
 ye blike hole anuroop gurutveey blike hole ke samaan nahin hote hai, lekin gurutv pramaatra siddhanton kii jaanch ke liye ye mahatvapurn hai
 They behave like black holes, which have nothing to do with gravity and the quantum theory of gravity, in line with the theory of strong nuclear power
 ve samaan hai kyonki donon string siddhant dwaara varnit kiye jate hai
 Therefore, the formation and dissolution of fire spheres in quark gluons plasma can be explained in the language of black holes

 For a more in-depth discussion, see: Particle collision protection in the Large Hadron Collider
 saamaanya saapekshata main aise vinyas kii sambhaavna kaa varnan kiya gaya he jisamen do blike hole ek duusare se jude hue hai
 Such a configuration is usually called a wormhole
 varmholon ne kalpit vigyaan kathaon ke lekhakon ko prerit kiya he kyonki ve ati lambi duuri kii yatraaon ko shighrata se tay karne kaa saadhan pradaan karte hai, time travel bhi
 In practice, such configurations are almost impossible in astrophysics, as no known process seems to allow the creation of these objects
 1971 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki paaramparik blike hole ke kisi bhi sangrah ke ghatana kshitij ke kul kshetra ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve aapas main takaraa kar ek duusare ko nigal len, arthath vilay ho jaae
 This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, where the field plays the role of entropy
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki shunya taapmaana hone kii vajah se blike hole kii entropy shunya hogi
 If this were the case, the entry of entropy-rich matter into the black hole would have violated the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe
 isliye, jacob bekensten ne prastaav rakhaa ki ek blike hole kii ek entropy chahie or ise ghatana kshitij kaa anupaatik hona chahie
 Since black holes traditionally do not emit radiation, the thermodynamic approach seems to be consistent, as zero temperature means infinite changes in entropy by any sum of heat, which means infinite entropy
 haalaanki, 1974 main, hawking ne ghatana kshitij ke paas pramaatra kshetra siddhant ko vakrit antariksh-samay par lagu kiya or paaya ki blike hole hawking vikiran chhodte hai, jo ek tarah kaa tapiya vikiran he or unru prabhaav se sambaddh he, jiskaa arth yah niklaa ki unamem ek saakaratmak taapmaana nihit he
 This reinforced the simulation between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the first law of black hole mechanics, it can be concluded that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole will be one-fourth of the area of its event horizon 
 yah ek saarvbhaumik parinaam he or ise sampoorn brahmadia kshitij par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii di citter antariksh kshetra main
 Later it was suggested that a black hole is an object with maximum entropy, that is, the maximum possible entropy of a single region of space would be the entropy of the largest black hole that can be contained in that region
 isaki vajah se holographic siddhant kii utpatti hui
 Hawking radiation refers to the specific temperature of a black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy
 taapmaana jitna giregaa, blike hole utana hi vishaal hota jaayegaa: jitani adhik urja avashoshit karegaa, utana hi adhik adhik thanda hota jaayegaa
 a black hole with approximately the mass of the planet Mercury has a temperature in equilibrium with celestial micro-wave radiation
 isse adhik baari hone par, ek blike hole prishthbhumi vikiran se adhik thanda ho jayega or yah hawking vikiran ke madhyam se utsarjit urja kii tulana main, prishthbhumi se zyada teji se urja praapt karegaa, isse bhi adhik thanda ho jaayegaa
 However, in a less massive black hole this effect would indicate that the mass of the black hole evaporates slowly over time, while the black hole will continue to heat up while doing so
 haalaanki ye prabhaav un blike hole ke liye naganya hai jo antarikshawya rup se gathit hone ke liye paryaapt rup se baari hai, ve kaalpanik chote blike hole ke liye badi teji se mahatvapurn ho jaayenge, jahaan pramaatra-yantric prabhaav haaavee hon
 In fact, small black holes will probably evaporate at a rapid rate and eventually disappear with an explosion of radiation
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog kisi blike hole kii entropy kii gananaa hetu kiya ja saktaa he, yah sthiti siddhanthata santushti dene vaala nahin he
 In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as the calculation of the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have similar microscopic properties
 lekin ek pramaatra gurutv ke santoshjanak siddhant ke bina, blike hole ke liye is prakaar kii gananaa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 However, little hope has been aroused by string theory, according to which the microscopic amount of freedom of a black hole is D-branes
 pradaan kiye gayi charge or urja dwaara di-brans kii avasthaaon kii gananaa karke, kuch khaas ati samamit blike hole ke utkram maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Extending the field of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research

 It is necessary to emphasize that the equations of general relativity do in fact follow t-symmetry and that the fact that the above argument comes from the application of general relativity should be a bit cautious
 yah is tathy kii vajah se he ki time-cymetric siddhant dwaara time-reversal-acemmetric nishkarsh tak pahunchaana sambhav nahin he, jo is maamle main saamaanya saapekshata he
 Rindler coordinates, which are applied near the event horizon for an external viewer, are T-symmetric, so the existence of something like an "invariant" process can be ruled out
 yah sambhav he ki "virodhabhas" time-samamit siddhant par time-asamamit seemaa ko lagu karne kaa parinaam he, yah isko loshmit virodhabhas kaa ek prakaar banataa he
 Considerations of quantum gravity, on the other hand, suggest that there may only be a finite finite inverse measurement that will be related to the space near the horizon: but the change in the horizon's entropy and the Hawking radiation's entropy measure are sufficient Happens to contain all the transverse measurements of matter and energy that are falling into a black hole
 haalaanki kai bhautikeevidon kii yah chintaa he ki yah abhi bhi thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 In particular, at a quantum level, the quantum state of Hawking radiation is determined only by what has previously fallen into the black hole; And the history of what had fallen into a black hole is determined solely by the quantum state of black hole and radiation
 yahi niyatatvvaad or kendrikaran kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For a long time Stephen Hawking defied the idea, insisting on his original 1975 position that Hawking radiation is completely thermal, therefore completely disorganized, with no information of the material previously ingested by the black hole
 ; He argued that this information has been omitted
 haalaanki, 21 july 2004 main, unhone nayaa tark prastut kiya, apane pichley tark ke vipareet
 In this new calculation, the entropy measurement corresponding to the black hole passes out to the Hawking radiation
 haalaanki, ise siddhant main samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he, jab tak blike hole apana vashpikaran puraa na kar le
 Until then, it is impossible to establish a 1: 1 approach to Hawking radiation information and the initial state of the system
 ek baar jab blike hole puri tarah vashpit ho jaye, unki pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unamem hua kendrikaran sangrakshit rahata he
 By the time Hawking completed his calculations, it was quite clear by the ads / CFT relationship that black holes decay in a unitary way
 kyonki gej siddhanton main aag ke gole, jo hawking vikiran ke anuroop hai, nishchit rup se ekaatmak hai
 Hawking's new calculations have not been evaluated by the expert scientific community, because their methods are unintentional and of questionable conformity

 Leonard Saskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard t Huft have suggested that the three-dimensional space around the black hole can be fully characterized by a two-dimensional behavior of the event horizon
 ve isapar vishwaas karte hai kyonki yah blike hole jaankaree-lop virodhabhas kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he
 This idea has been adapted under string theory, and is known as holographic theory

 Some experts differ, yet this sura is considered the second sura revealed to Muhammad
 pratham sura al-alak ke praapt hone ke uparaant ek shant antaraal tha, jisamen koi vaartalap nahin hua
 This made the newly created Prophet suspect that he did not offend God, that he has not been giving any message for so long

 He continued to consider Hindi as the means to achieve independence before the independence of the country and to maintain independence after independence
 " yahan yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki tandon ji kaa raajnneeti main pravesh hindi prem ke kaaran hi hua
 Tandon ji worked as a lecturer in Hindi at Victoria College, Gwalior, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a student of Victoria College at that time
 17 farvari 1951 ko mujffarnagar 'suhrid sangh' ke 17 wein varshikotsav ke avasar par tandon ji ne kaha tha- "hindi ke paksh ko sabal karne ke uddeshy se hi maine congress jaisi sanstha main pravesh kiya, kyonki mere hriday par hindi kaa hi prabhaav sabase adhik tha or maine use hi apane jivan kaa sabase mahaan vrath banaaya

 My love for Hindi literature forced me to join politics to protect her interests and to clarify the path of her development
 " at: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki tandon ji ke saadhy swatantraaa or hindi donon hi the
 Rajarshi had an affection for Hindi since childhood
 is prem ko baalkrishna bhatta or madan mohan malviya ji ne praudhata pradaan karne kii
 On October 10, 1910, the first session of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan was held in Kashi under the chairmanship of Mahamana Malaviya ji and Tandon Ji was appointed the minister of the conference
 tadnantar hindi sahitya sammelan ke madhyam se hindi kii atyadhik seva kii
 Tandon ji established Hindi Vidyapeeth Prayag to spread Hindi
 is peeth kii sthapana kaa uddeshy hindi shiksha kaa prasar or angreji ke varchasv ko samaapt karnaa tha
 The conference held several Hindi examinations
 in parikshaon se dakshin main bhi hindi kaa prachaar prasar hua
 This work of the conference also had an impact in colleges and universities, Hindi courses were recognized in many colleges and universities
 ve jaanate the ki sampoorn bharat main hindi ke prasar ke liye ahindi bhashiyon kaa sahyog apekshit he
 Perhaps the result of his thinking was Gandhi's participation in the conference
 aage chalakar 'hindustani' ke prashn par tandon ji or mahatma gandhi main matbhed hua
 Tandon ji was an unbeatable warrior
 ve satya or nyaay ke liye kisi se bhi loha le sakate the
 On his principles, he remained immobile and stable like a rock
 parinamat: gandhi ji ko apane ko sammelan se alag karnaa padaa, tandon ji niraapad apane maarg par badhate rahe
 In 1949, when the question of official language was raised in the Constituent Assembly, there was a strange situation at that time
 mahatma gandhi to hindustani ke samarthak the hi, pan0 nehru or dow rajendra prasad tathaa anya anek netaa bhi hindustani ke pakshdhar the, par tandon ji haare nahin, jhuke nahin
 As a result, he also won
 11, 12, 13, 14 disambar 1949 ko garmagaram bahes ke baad hindi or hindustani ko lekar congress main matdaan hua, hindi ko 62 or hindustani ko 32 mat mili
 Eventually, Hindi was declared as the national language and Devanagari royalty
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha or 'vandemaataram' ko raashtragit sweekrut karaane ke liye tandon ji ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ek or abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 He had also collected signatures and letters of support from crores of people
 yahan yah ullekh kar dena bhi apekshit he ki tandon ji ne nagari ankon ko samvidhan main manyata dilaane ke liye bharsak koshish kii is hetu unhone us sanstha ko choda jisaki seva lagbhag paanch dashak tak kii
 In the Constituent Assembly, Rajarshi opposed the English numerals, but due to the instruction of Nehru ji, Congress Member Shri Kanhaiyalal Maniklal Munshi was in favor of the formula of Shri Gopal Swami Iyengar
 tandon ji kaa virodh prastaav gir gaya or nagari ank samvidhan main manyata praapt na kar sake
 In order to get Hindi the national language and 'vande Mataram' the national anthem, Tandon ji launched another campaign with his colleagues
 unhone karodon logon ke hastakshar or samarthan patr bhi ekatra kiye the
 While assessing the personality and work of Rajarshi, often his litterateur form is ignored
 vah ek ucchkoti ke rachanaakaar the
 The earliest history can be discovered in his works
 sahityakar ke rup main tandon ji nibandhkaar, kavi or patrkaar ke rup main dikhalaai padate hai
 His essays are related to Hindi language and literature, religion and culture and other diverse fields
 kavy rachanaaon main 'bandar sabha mahakavy', 'kutir kaa pushp' or 'swatantraaa' apana aitihaasik mahatv rakhti hai
 These poems feature nationalism and patriotism
 unki rachanaaon main kavyashastra kii baariki foondnaa chhidranveshan karnaa hi hoga, kintu yugin yatharth kii abhivyakti tandon ji ne jis dhang se kii he, vah nishchay hi shlaghneey he- The 'bandar Sabha epic' has exposed the policies of the British in the Alha style
 unhone angrejon ke prati jo chutkiyaan lee hai unamem se ek-do kaa anand aap bhi lijie- In the field of journalism, Tandon ji was also a great scholar of English
 shri tribhuvan narayan singh ji ne ullekh kiya he ki san 1950 main jab ve congress ke sabhapati chune gaye to unhone apana abhibhaashan hindi main likhaa or angreji anuwaad maine kiya
 Shri Sampurnanand ji also saw that English translation, but when Tandon ji read that translation, he rewrote many pages in it
 tab mujhe is baat kii anubhuti hui ki jahaan ve hindi ke prakand vidwaan the, vahiin angreji sahitya par bhi unka bada adhikaar tha
 Seeing the multi-dimensional and talented personality of Purushottam Das Tandon, he was conferred with the title of 'rajarshi'
 15 april san 1948 kii sandhyavela main sarayu tat par vaidic mantrocchar ke saath mahant devraha baba ne aapako 'rajarshi` kii oopaadhi se alankrita kiya
 Some people found it unfair, but Sri Shankaracharya Maharaj of Jyotirmath considered it scriptural and confirmed it by the Pandit Sabha of Kashi at the degree distribution ceremony of the All India Cultural Conference of 1948
 tab se yah oopaadhi unke naam ke saath avichhinn rup se judi hui swayan alankrita ho rahi he
 The Rajarshi was a staunch opponent of stereotypes and superstitions even though Indian culture was extremely supportive and supportive
 unhone bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kuprathaon par bhi apane do took vichaar vyakt kiye
 He had a wonderful self-power, so that he could complete the toughest tasks easily
 balvivaah or vidhwaa vivaah ke sambandh main unka maananaa tha ki "vidhwaa vivaah kaa prachaar hamaari sabhyataa, hamaare sahitya or hamaare samaaj sanghathan ke mukhya aadhaar pativrat dharm ke pratikul hai" unhone spasht kiya ki vidhwaa-vivaah kii maang isliye jor pakad rahi he, kyonki hamaare samaaj main bal-vivaah kii shaastra viruddh pranali chal padi he or bal vidhwaaon kaa prashn hi bhartiya samaaj kii mukhya samasya he
 Hence, "stopping the practice of child marriage proves to be more important than widow's marriage
" " One or two examples of this aspect of his personality will suffice - often people think that cooked food is digestible, but Rajarshi considered it a stereotype and did not accept food cooked with fire for years
 chini khaanaa ek baar chhod diya
 On one hand they avoided cow's milk and on the other hand with leather shoes
 is prakaar ve ek adbhut vyaktitv ke dharak the
 In India, the problem of communalism existed in its form before independence
 kuch netaa tandon ji par bhi sampradayik hone kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 It is true that Rajarshi was the ultimate devotee and nurturer of his culture
 ve yah kehane main bhi hichak kaa anubhav nahin karte the ki bharat main do samskritiyon ko jivit rakhana desh ke saath vishwasghaat karnaa hoga, par iskaa matlab yah nahin tha ki tandon ji sampradayik the, muslim virdohi the
 In this regard, how meaningful are the views of Kulakusum- swayan tandon ji ne bhi likhaa he- In fact, Tandon's personality was humanistic
 unke ghar par jo balak unka sahyog karata tha, vah musalmaan tha, par kisi vidmbana he ki log kehete hai ki tandon ji sampradayik the
 There are many other aspects of Rajarshi Tandon's personality; Just like he was the poor, the victim's help, Deenbandhu in the true sense, the idol of compassion and Babuji was a person of moral conduct, it can be inferred from this example- "san 1950 kaa mahakumbh tha
 The daughter-in-law said to go by car to take a bath in the Ganges
 babu ji ne uttar diya ki gaadi 'spikar` kii he
 You can go with me, but not alone
 " After the above brief discussion it can be said that Rajarshi's personality was multi-faceted and consistent with Rajarshi
 ve bahumukhi pratibha ke dhani the
 He was not only an exclusive lover of Hindi, but was also synonymous with Hindi
 hindi sahitya ke itihaas main unka ullekh ek samarth kavi or niabandh lekhak ke rup main hota he
 He is counted among the frontline fighters among the immortals of the Indian freedom struggle and his name is inscribed with golden letters in the history of the Indian freedom struggle
 ve param snehi, udaar or karunaa kii murti hote hue bhi ispati vyaktitv ke dharak the
 Immovable and unalterable like the Himalayas
 param hindi sevi, raashtra-bhakt or bhartiya samskruti ke is upaask ko meraa shat shat naman
 In 1961, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest state honor of India

 mandandak nitishastra nitishastreey kaary kaa adhyayan hai
 It is a branch of philosophical ethics that examines the questions that arise when thinking how one should act morally
 isaki vyupatti mandandak se hui, jiskaa sambandh kisi adarsh maanak yaa model se hai, yaa us par aadhaarit hai, jo, koi chiz karne kaa saamaanya yaa uchit tarika mana jaataa ho
 Critical ethics differs from ethics in that it tests the parameters of what works are right or wrong, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts
 mandandak nitishastra varnatmak nitishastra se bhi bhinn hai, kyonki pashchaatkathit logon kii naitik aasthaaon kii anubhavsiddh jaanch hai
 In other words, descriptive ethics is concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that murder is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is wrong to hold it
 atah, kabhi-kabhi mandandak nitishastra ko varnatmak ke bajaay nirdeshaatmak kaha jaataa hai
 However, in some versions of the meta-ethnographic view, called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and normative at the same time
 zyaadaatar paramparaagat naitik siddhant un siddhanton par aadhaarit hai jo nirdhaarit karte hai ki koi kaary sahi yaa galat hai yaa nahin
 In this style, classical theories include forms of utilitarianism, Kantianism and some constitutionalism
 yah siddhanth mushkil naitik nirnyon kaa samaadhaan karne hetu mukhyatah naitik siddhanton kaa vyapak upyog pradaan karte hai
 There are disagreements about what exactly it is that gives its moral force to an action, rule or ayan
 Broadly speaking, there are three competing views on how moral questions should be answered, along with hybrid positions that combine some elements of each
 gun nitishastra kaa focus kaary karne waalon ke charitra par hota hai, jabaki donon, karttavyavaigyanik nitishastra or parinamwad kaa focus kaary, niyam yaa ayaan kii sthiti par hota hai
 Both theories of the so-called ethics, in themselves, come in many forms
