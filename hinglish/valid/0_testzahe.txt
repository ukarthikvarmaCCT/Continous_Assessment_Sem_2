 He also predicted that M2O3 would dissolve in acid to give MX3 salts, that mono-aluminum salts would form basic salts, that mono-aluminum sulfate alums should form, and that the anhydrous mcl3 would take off more than zncl2 -increased: These predictions made all out may be true

 Originally, de Boisbaudran determined the density of gallium as 4

 According to a legend, the birth of Taurasurka was caused by the contemplative Shivaji's forehead sweat and he was a threat to the gods
 ek baar vishnu haygrivaka avatar liya tha tab vah jwarasurake bukhaarase peedit the
 So they killed the demon Jyvasura
 unhone apane sudarshan chakrase uske teen tukade kar diye
 However, Brahmana revived the tide and added all three parts of it
 lekin us samay uske tino hissonmen se prayek ke sir or angakaa vikaas ho gaya tha
 In this way, the jowasura appears to have three faces and three legs and has an extraordinary ability to move in all directions at once

 ek anya katha ke anusaar, maan durga devi katyayani ke rup main avatar liya or kalkeya dwaara bheje gaye kai rakshason ko maar daalaa
 The fever of the fever named Jaurasur started spreading incurable diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, measles, smallpox in childhood friends of Katyayani
 isliye katyayani apane bimariose grast dostonka ilaaj kiya
 After that, Katyayani took the form of Sheetla Devi to give relief to the whole world from fever and diseases
 unke chaar haath main se ek haathamein chota jhaadu, duusare haathamein pankhaa,tisare haathamein thande panika bartan or chauthe haathamein pine kaa pyaalaa rakhti he
 He used his power to cure diseases of all children
 uske baad katyayanine apane dost batukako aagrah kiya ki vah baahar jaaen or rakshas jwarasur ke saath yuddh kare
 Hence the war between the young Batuk and the demon Jyvasura started
 daanav jwarasur batukako haraane main safal ho gaya
 Batuk then fell dead
 jwarasur hairaan ho gaya tha kyoki batuka kahin dikh nahi rahaa tha
 But he did not know that Batuk had taken the form of a terrible man

 The head demon Jessa and he had an ax, sword, trident
 unka rang andhera jesa kaala tha
 His hair was flying
 ankhen krodhse jal rahi thi
 He wore garlands of tiger skin and skulls
 batukane shivaji kaa ek bhayanak avatar kalbhairavaka rup le liya tha
 After that Kalabhairava condemns the tide and tells him that he is a servant of Goddess Durga Devi
 un donomen ek lambii bahes hoti he, lekin vah phir ladaai main parivartit jaati he
 Through his power, many demons arose, but all were destroyed by Kalabhairav
 ant main, kalbhairavane jwarasurake saath mallayuddh kiya or baadamein apane trishulase usko maar daalaa
 The cult of Shitala devi-jyvasura is widely popular in Bengali culture
 sanyog se, bengali, oriya or hindi bhashaaon, bukhaarko jwara ke rup main janaa jaataa he or asur kaa arth he rakshas hota he
 The name Jyavasuraka is a combination of two words
 - jwara or asur - jwarasur
 Thus, Jyavasura is a demon of fever
 esa kaha jaataa he ki sheetala devi or jwarasur apane gadhe par ek saath yatra karte he
 Jyavasura Yuvan is a servant

 Razia ruled the Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240

 Razia of Turkish origin was practiced in the leadership and administration of the army like other Muslim princesses, so that it could be used when needed
 
 razia sultanaa muslim evam turki itihaas ki pehali mahila shaasha thim
 Razia was made the Sultan of Delhi after the death of his father Shams-ud-din Iltutmish
 iltutamish, pehla aisa shaasha tha, jisane apane baad kisi mahila ko uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 However, it was not acceptable for the Muslim class to inherit a woman from Iltutmish, so after his death his younger son Raknuddin Firoz Shah was placed on the throne
 raknuddin, kaa shashan bahut hi kam samay ke liye tha, iltutamish kii vidhwaa, shah turkan kaa shashan par niyantran nahin rah gaya tha
 The public outraged against the lax and reckless Raknuddin to the extent that Raknuddin and his mother, Shah Turkan, were assassinated on 9 November 1236
 uskaa shashan maatr chah maah kaa tha
 After this, in the absence of any other option for the Sultan, the Muslims had to give the reins of governance to a woman
 
 And Razia Sultan became the ruler of Delhi
 shashan kaaryon main razia kii ruchi apane pita ke shashan ke samay se hi thi
 After assuming the throne, Razia preferred to wear a soldiers coat and turban like men, unlike customs
 balki, baad main yuddh main bina nakaab pahane shaamil hui
 Razia renounced the curtain, wearing choga kulah like men and started opening her mouth in the court razia apni raajnneetik samajhadaari or nitiyon se sena tathaa jansadharan kaa dhyaan rakhti thi
 She became the most powerful ruler of Delhi
