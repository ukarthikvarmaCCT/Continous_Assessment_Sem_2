 bihar kaa madhyakaalin yug 12 veen shatabdi se prarambh hota he
 It is believed that the order of ancient history was broken along with the Karnataka dynasty
 isi kaal main turkon kaa akraman bhi prarambh ho gaya tha tathaa bihar ek sangathit raajnneetik ikai ke rup main na tha balki uttar kshetra or dakshin kshetreey prabhaav main banta tha
 Therefore, to get the historical source of medieval Bihar one has to look at various historical texts which were composed during this period
 madhyakaalin bihar ke sroton main abhilekh, nuhaani rajya ke strot, vibhinn raajaaon evam jameendaaron ke raajnneetik jivan evam anya sattaaon se unke sangharsh, yatriyon dwaara diye gayi vivaran ityadi mahatvapurn hai
 In historical texts, Minhaj is the "tabaqat-e-nasiri" composition of that Shiraz which provides important information regarding the activities of the early Ottoman invasion in Bihar
 barani kaa taarikh-e-firozshahi bhi mahatvapurn aitihaasik strot he

 babar dwaara rachit tujuke-e-babari evam jahangir dwaara rachit tujuke main bhi bihar ke mughal shasankaleen gatividhiyon kii jaankaree milti he
 Both these texts provide information about the military campaign of the Mughals in Bihar during their time
 is prakaar madhyakaalin bihar ke aitihaasik strot bihar kii jaankaree ke atyant mahatvapurn strot hai
 Integrated circuit or monopoly in electronics) is also known as micropath, microchip, silicon chip, or just chip
 yah ek ardhchaalak padaarth ke andar bana hua electronic paripath hi hota he jisamen pratirodh, sandharitra aadi pasive component ke alaava diod, trangistor aadi ardhchaalak avyav nirmit kiye jate hai
 Just as a normal circuit is constructed by adding different components, the IC is not constructed by making all the components within a semiconductor follow a specific process simultaneously
 ekikrut paripath aajkal jivan ke har kshetra main upyog main laaye ja rahe hai
 Due to these, the size of electronic devices has become very small, their working capacity has become very high and their power requirement has been reduced
 sankar ekikrut paripath bhi laghu aakaar ke ekipari hote hai kintu ve alag-alag avyavon ko ek chote board par jodakar evam apoxi aadi main jadkar banaaye jate hai
 Hence they are different from monolithic ics
 sookshmchip, ekipari kii ek chip hoti he, jo ki silicon se bani hoti he
 This program is made for logic and computer memory

 Microchip has completed its 50-year journey
 1958 main iskaa avishkaar robert nois or jaik kilbe ne kiya tha
 Both of them worked in different companies and both companies were doing this research from their perspective
 is shodh ke uparaant baad donon hi companiyon ne iske patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 Later both companies were jointly licensed and its joint patents were granted
 pehali baar sookshmchip 1961 main logon ko uplabdh hui
 Jick Kilbey later invented the portable calculator
 tab se lekar ab tak sookshmchip main kai badlaav aa chuke hai
 While the first microchip had a transistor, a capacitor and three registers, today's microchip contains about 125 million transistors in a small space
 sookshmchip ke kai or laabh bhi hai
 Microchip is currently used in biological systems
 iskaa prayog jivan bachaane main bhi hone laga he
 Pacemakers also have microchip for heart patients

 Microchip is used in everything from watches, mobile phones to space shuttles
 san 1947 main transistor ke avishkaar ke baad ekipari ke vikaas kaa rasta saaf ho gaya tha
 In 1958-59, two persons developed almost the same type of IC almost at the same time
 ve alag-alag kaam kar rahe the or ek-duusare ke kaam se anbhigya the
 These individuals were Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce, co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation
 dono hi vidyut ejeeniyar the or dono hi is baat kaa hal nikaalane main jute hue the ki anekanek sankhyaon vaale paripathon ko kaise vishwasaneey rup se nirmit kiya jaay or unka aakaar kaise chota kiya jaay
 Today we can say that if the transistor had not been invented, it would not have been incompatible; And if it were not integrated, there would not be computers and other electronic devices whose circuit is made up of billions of components
 ekipari ke vikaas se nimnlikhit laabh hote hai- Integrated circuits are divided into three parts based on the nature of the circuit inside them - digital ekikrut paripathon ko unamem prayukt transistoron kii sakhya ke aadhaar par small scale integrated, medium scale integrated, large scale integrated, veri large scale integrated, ultra large scale integrated aadi main baanta jaataa he
 In the initial days there were only a few transistors inside the IC
 jaise-jaise takneekee kaa vikaas hua, isi ke andar lakhon, karodon or arabon trangistor banane lage hai

 aldihado se bane yogicon ko aldoxim tathaa kitonon se bane yogic kitoxim kehalaate hai
 Their sources are shown in the front figure
 oxim ve rasinic yogic hai jinka saamaanya sutara R1R2C=NOH he jisamen R1 koi carbonic chen he tathaa R2 yaa to hydrogen he jo eldaxim banaati he yaa koi doosraa carbonic samooh he jo kitoxim banaata he
 The first was built by Axim Victor Mayer in 1878 AD
 iske baad aldihide tathaa kitonon ke shuddhikaran tathaa unki pahchaan main oxymon ke mahatv ke kaaran tathaa in yogicon kii vinyas-samavyawata ke kaaran, rasayanagyon ne inke adhyayan main vishesh ruchi dikhalaai, jiske falswaroop inase sambhddha inek mahatvapurn anusandhan hue
 The specific reason for their use in the purification and detection of aldehydes and ketones is that oximes are soluble in solid state and insoluble in water; Therefore, they can be attained in a pure state
 hydrochloric yaa gandhakaml ke vilyan ke saath garam karne se oxymon kaa jalavishleshan ho jaataa he
 As a result, aldehydes or ketones are recovered in an independent state
 oxymon ke apchayan se praathmik amin praapt haate hai at: -C-OCO-C-NH main parivartit karne main inkaa prayog hota he
 Aldaxim can be dehydrated by acid chloride, which makes some oximes, combined with metallic elements, to form permanent subclasses
 lagbhag ek samaan gunwale or sambandhti vividh tatwon se is prakaar bananevaale yogicon kii vileyata ek duusare se bhinn hoti he
 For this reason, in analytical chemistry, these oximes are of great importance
 salicil aldoxim anek dhaatuon se is prakaar ke yogic banaata he, parantu tambe ke saath bane yogic ko chhodkar anya dhaatuon se bane sabhi yogic tanu aseetic amla main viley hai
 The compound made with copper is a powder of greenish-yellow color and it is heated to 110 ° C
 Can be dried and kept permanent
 at: iffrhem ne is oxim kaa anya tatwon se taanbe ke pruthakkaran tathaa uske parimaapan ke liye upyog karnaa acha batalaaya he
 Similarly, dimethyl glyxime, which is the dioxim of diketone-di-acetyl, forms narrow compounds with many metals, of which only compounds made of nickel and palladium are insoluble in dilute acids and dilute alkali solutions
 at: nikal tathaa paladium ke parimaapan tathaa nikal ko cobalt se purnat: pruthak karne main is oxim kaa bahut upyog hota he
 An oxime of beta naphthoquinone forms a similar insoluble compound with cobalt, which is used in the measurement of cobalt
 vinyas rasayan ke vikaas main oxymon kaa mahatv kuch kam nahin he
 In 1883, Hans Goldsmith discovered that the bi-oxime of benzyl was found in two forms, then in 1889, Victor Mayer also made a third form
 usee varsh becoman ne bataaya ki benzeldyhide kaa bhi do roopon main paaya jaataa he
 By applying Hant to compounds having> c = CC = N-, it was shown that the affixes of the axes are geometric isomers
 unke anusaar aldihidon tathaa asamamit kitonon ke oxim do roopon main paae jaayenge jinhen is prakaar likh sakate hai : This isomerism is similar to that of malic acid and fumeric acid at> c = c <
 kitonon main yah keval asamamit kitonon main sambhav he, kyonki R1 tathaa R2 ke ek ho jane se phir in do roopon main koi antar nahin rah jaataa
 On the basis of this, the forms of benzyl bi-oxim can also be written
 kitonon ke oxymon kii phosforus pentaxide ke saath ether main pratikriya karne se jo padaarth miltaa he us par jal kii pratikriya se pratisthapit acid-amide praapt hote hai
 This action is called Beckmann reconfiguration

 The element which was previously combined with carbon, now transfers from the element oriented with nitrogen
 in padaarthon kaa is prakaar becoman roopantaran ke falswaroop bananaa is baat kii pushti karata he ki samaavyavi oxymon kii rachana to ek si he, parantu uski samavyawata mulkon ke tal main vibhinn prakaar se sthit hone ke kaaran hoti he

 Chemists like Sutton etc
 have expressed their views from time to time on the basis of many experiments, but many things have not yet been decided in relation to the axes
