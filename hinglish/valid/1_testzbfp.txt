 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs
 ye ek ishwar ke hi alag-alag rup or shaktiyaan hai

 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina
 janm maran kaa sansaarik chakra tabhi khatm hota he jab vyakti ko moksh miltaa he
 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra

 a graph relative to the frequency of the transfer function of a linear time-unchanged system is called a Bode graph or 'bode plot'
 isamen aavriti-aksh laghuganakeey-paimaane main hoti he
 The Bode plot literally represents the frequency response of a system
 bodi plot praayah do aalekh hote hai - The article is named after Hendrick Wade Bode, the famous Comptroller Engineer of the Bell Laboratory, USA
 unhone 1930 ke dashak main labdhi or kala ko plot karne kii ek atyant saral kintu parishuddh vidhi bataayi
 This article is used a lot for the analysis and design of control systems
 computer prograamon ke aa jane se aajkal yah kaam or bhi aasaan ho gaya he
 Below are given bodi graphs of some of the basic ingredients most commonly encountered in transfer functions
 prayek chitra main upar vaala aalekh pariman kaa aalekh he tathaa uske neeche kaa aalekh kala kaa he
 The axial axis is the angular frequency w
 grih vigyaan shiksha kii vah vidha he jiske antargat paak shaastra, poshan, grih arthshaastra, upabhokta vigyaan, bacchon kii parvarish, maanav vikaas, aantarik sajja, vastra evam paridhaan, grih-nirmaan aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Historically, when education was given to the children for agriculture or 'shop' etc
, the need of teaching this subject was felt for the girls
 jaisaa ki naam se hi pataa chalata he, grih vigyaan kaa sambandh grih yani ki ghar se hai
 People generally understand that home science is a matter of home care and home furnishing
 lekin unka aisa samajhnaa keval aanshik rup se satya he
 The field of home science is very wide and diverse
 iskaa dayera ‘ghar’ kii seemaa se kahin aage tak nikal jaataa he or yah keval khaanaa pakaane, kapadey dhone-sanbhaalane, silaai-kadhai karne yaa ghar kii sajaavat aadi tak simit nahin rah jaataa
 In fact, this is the only subject that prepares young students for two important goals of their lives - caring for home and family and preparing for a career or profession in their lives
 aajkal mahila tathaa purush donon hi ghar tathaa parivaar kii jimmedaariyaan samaan rup se nibhaate hai tathaa apane jivan ko sukhmay banane ke liye uplabdh sansadhano ke behatar upyog kii taiyaari main bhi baraabar kii sahabhaagita nibhaate hai
 Home science or home science is related to you, your home, your family members and everything related to your resources
 iskaa uddeshy he - aapke sansadhano ke prabhaavshaalee tathaa vaigyanik upyog dwaara aapako tathaa aapke parivaar ke sadasyon ko bharpoor santushti pradaan karnaa
 Home science means the art of effective management of your resources and a science that helps you to keep a home healthy and peaceful and in the choice of a successful profession when needed
 grih vigyaan aapako chizon ko upyog karne kii kala sikhaata he, jisase ki chaaron or ek sampurna suvyavastha, sundarataa or aandmayi vaataavaran ke nirmaan main sahaayta milti he
 In addition, it also provides scientific information related to home care
 ise ham ek udhaaharan ke dwaara aasaani se samaj sakate hai- grih vigyaan sharir ke liye aavashyak poshak tattvon ke bare main jaankaree pradaan karata he tathaa saath hi unke kaaryon ke bare main bhi bataata he
 It is a 'science'
 or jab aap inhen aavashyak poshak tattvon se bharpoor bhojan ko apane parivaar ko aakarshak dhang se paroste hai to yah ek ’kala’ he
 This coordination of science and art comes in every area of your life
 unamem se kuch nimnlikhit hai - After studying various areas of home science, you can better manage your resources
 yadi aisa karte hue aapako kisi prakaar kii samasya pesh aati he, to grih vigyaan use hal karne ke liye aapako sahi disha nirdesh degaa
 By doing this you become an influential person
 is gyaan kaa upyog aap apane ghar or jivan ke vikaas main kar sakate hai
 You and your family members can use your skills to improve your financial situation and experience more satisfaction
 jab aap apane parivaar kii jaruraton ko puraa karne main sakasham honge tabhi ve bhi ghar or baahar donon taraf kii jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah kar paane main sakasham honge
 Time, energy, efficiency etc
 are some other resources which are helpful in management and home science helps you a lot in this
 aajkal zyaadaatar mahilaayein kaamkaaji hai, jo yaa to kaam karne ke liye ghar se baahar jaati hai, yaa ve ghar par hi rah kar apana swayan kaa koi rojgaar chalaati hai
 As a result, men's participation in household responsibilities has also increased
 chunki hamaare samaaj main paramparaagat rup se purush dhar ke kaaryon main bahut kriyasheel nahin hote, isliye unhen is vyavastha main dhalane main kaaphi pareshaani kaa anubhav hota he
 In such a situation, they need to know about the different aspects of the house and learn the skill to make the house beautiful and run properly
 grih vigyaan hi ek maatr aisa vishay he, jo yuvaaon ko ek safal grihasth banane, ek jimmedaar naagarik or ek achche mata-pita banane main sahaayak purvaabhyas or aavashyak suchanaane uplabdh karaata he
 Although home science is working in a very wide field of education, but even today, there is confusion in the mind of the common man about this subject
 or yah bhram kii sthiti keval isliye bani hui he ki log sochate hai ki ve jo sammaan or darja praapt karnaa chaahate hai vah sab de paane main grih vigyaan sakasham nahin he
 Mythology - Home science is limited only to cooking, washing and sewing-embroidery works - common people believe that all these things are taught and taught in it
 isliye yuva ladakiyon ke mata-pita badi aasaani se unhen yah vishay padhaane ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 They think it will help them in their later life
 sachai - khaanaa pakaana, kapade dhonaa or rakhana tathaa kadhai-bunai to grih vigyaan ke antargat padhaayaa jane vaala ek bahut hi chota sa hissaa he
 Actually, through this we learn all the basics related to our life - how our body functions, what kind of diet we need to be healthy, what rules to be followed for our own and environment cleanliness
 It is necessary that we should do to avoid diseases and what kind of management should be done when we and our souls are sick
 isamen ham ghar ke vividh kaaryon main upyog hone vaale kapadon ke chunaav ke bare main sikhte hai
 Children are an integral part of our life
 ham sabhi chaahate hai ki unka surakshit or samuchit vikaas ho
 In this course we learn how children develop before and after birth and what role we can play in their development as a good and responsible citizen
 iske alaava ham samay, urja tathaa paise jaise apane sansadhano kaa prabandhan bhi sikhte hai, jisase ki unke adhikadhik upyog se adhik santushti kaa anubhav karte hai
 Misconception - Home science is only related to girls - Many people believe that home science only teaches work related to home, so it should be read only by girls
 sachai- aaj mahilaayein tathaa purush donon ghar kii jimmedaariyon kaa baraabar saajha karte hai, kyonki aaj hamaare samaaj kii banaavat main kaaphi parivartan aayaa he
 Today, joint families are breaking up into single families
 aise main ghar kii jimmedaariyon ko pati or patni ko khud hi sanbhaalanaa padataa he
 Most women have started going to work outside the home, so men have become more and more in need of education about household responsibilities
 or in sari baton kii taiyaari athwa purvaabhyas keval grih vigyaan main hi ek vishay ke rup main mil sakati he
 This is the reason that many young men today have been oriented towards reading this subject
 bhranti- ise to apni maa / daadi maa se bhi siikhaa ja saktaa he - log sochate hai ki grih vigyaan main padhai jane vaali baaten to itani aasaan he ki unhen ghar main apni maa / daadi maa se bhi aasaani se siikhaa ja saktaa he
 For this, there is no need to study home science as a subject
 sachai- yah sach he ki ladkiyaan ghar kii bahut sari baaten apni maa yaa daadi ko kaam karte dekh kar sikhti hai, lekin itnaa bhar hi paryaapt nahin hota
 There are many works, which are traditionally going on in homes, but people do not know their scientific basis
 udhaaharan ke liye achaar ko hi lijie
 Everyone knows that pickles have to be covered with a layer of oil, but when you ask them why this is done, your mother will not be able to explain it
 lekin jab aap grih vigyaan kii padhai karenge, to yah aapako bataa degaa ki tel achaar ke tatwon ko hawa se kharaab hone se bachaata he
 Many similar examples will be found in everyone's life
 yah baat dhyaan rakhane yogya he ki jo kaam ham karte hai yadi ham uske bare main yah jaanate hai ki ham kya kar rahe hai or kyon kar rahe hai to vah kaam aasaan ho jaataa he
 Misconception - The study of home science is not helpful in career creation - Most people also think that since home science teaches about the work done indoors, it is unhelpful from the view of the career
 yadi koi yuva roji-roti kamanaa chahta he to use koi ’gambhir’ vishay padhanaa chahie
 Truth - Home Science provides many employment opportunities for both young boys and girls
 vidhyalay main grih vigyaan ke ek vishay ke rup main adhyayan se bahut saare rojgaar ke avasar uplabdh ho sakate hai
 But for this it is necessary that like other subjects, continue to study this subject even further and get specialization in a particular field
 aspataalon main dietician ke rup main, boutique main fishan diziner ke rup main, hotalon main parichaarak / paricharika athwa resepshanist ke rup main, skulon / collejon main adhyaaapak / adhyapika aadi ke rup main grih vigyaan kii padhai karke praapt hone vaale rojgaar ke kuch aam avasar hai
 After studying home science you can get very good income and satisfactory jobs
 grih vigyaan ke mukhya rup se paanch ang hai
 These are the following: aaj yah vigyaan itnaa viksit ho chukaa he ki iske prayek ang ke apane up-vibhaag bhi viksit ho chuke hai
 These sub-departments are as follows- bhartiya striyon ko kushal aadhunik gruhinee banane ke liye taiyaar kiye gayi paathyakram ko grih-vigyaan kii sangya di jaati he
 It is composed of a combination of domestic economics prevalent in America and domestic science teaching material prevalent in Britain
 is paathyakram main gharelu arthshaastra, kadhaayi-binaayi-silaayi, shishuon kaa laalan-paalan, naitik shiksha tathaa grih kaaryon main vyavastha evam swatchta jaise vishay shaamil kiye jate hai
 Critics of home science consider it a conspiracy to keep women in familiar and limited domestic roles, to maintain patriarchy and to keep women politically inactive
 duusari taraf grih-vigyaan ko bhartiya ghar ke daayre main ek shuruaati seemaa tak aadhuniktaa or rashtrawaad kaa vaahak bhi mana jaataa he
 Many feminist organizations in their time have associated home science in India with women's rights
 is vimarsh main ghar ko vishisht rup se ek nariwadi ikai mana gaya he
 This discussion assumes that through home science women get the right to build a family through the latest scientific techniques and latest information
 is tarah grih-vigyaan aadhuniktaa ke gharelu paksh kii paribhaasha ke ek ghatak ke taur par ubharta he jiske centre main vah prashikshit stri he jiske haath main puure parivaar ke shaareerik, maansik or naitik vikaas kaa daayitv saunpa gaya he
 The struggle for women equality and rights was also going on in the colonial period, and along with it, the campaign to marginalize women was continued, citing religion, tradition and established social system to maintain patriarchal system
 isi jaddojahad ke bich striyon ko aadhunik shiksha se jodne ke prayaas kiye gayi, lekin unhen purushon ke samaan shikshit karne main baari adchane thim
 Meanwhile, a separate study area of home science was created to educate Indian women according to their environment
 grih-vigyaan main striyon ko behatar gruhinee banane ke saath ek shikshit naagarik ke rup main viksit karne kaa adarsh bhi shaamil tha
 The British administration also took initiative in this area
 grih-vigyaan ke adhyaapan ke liye stri-adhyapakon ko prashikshan dene kaa kaarykram shuru kiya gaya
 The administration, along with Indian social-reformers, first selected widow women for this training
 prashikshan ke uparaant ye striyaan aarthik rup se swazlambi ban sakati thim
 The administration was also willing to postpone programs like social reforms necessary to improve the condition of widows due to heavy opposition from the antiquarian society
 stri-adhyapakon ke prashikshan ke aarmabhik daur main adhiktar auraten isai samudaay yaa gair-brahman samaaj se thim
 But some prominent Indian social reformers of higher varna also encouraged women of their families to participate in this training
 european madhyamik skulon main grih-vigyaan ke adhyaapan ko lokapriy banane ke liye anek naye shikshan va prashikshan santhaan sthapit kiye gayi
 To provide a scientific approach to home science, the basic principles of science were incorporated in the teaching material, making its training practical and practical
 bharat main stri-adhikaron ke liye saarvajanik taur par abhiyaan chalaane kaa shrey brahm samaaj ke agrani netaa devendra nath thakur kii putree or rabindranath thakur kii bahan swarna kumari devi ko jaataa he
 He started training in Calcutta in 1882 to make widows and poor women economically independent
 isi prakaar pandita ramabai saraswati ne pune main arya stri samaaj or sharada sadan ke madhyam se striyon ko rojgaar dilaane ke liye prashikshit karne kaa kaarykram chalaaya tha
 In 1910, Sarala Devi Chaudharani, the daughter of Swarna Kumari Devi, started a campaign to educate women at her home only by establishing the Bharat Stree Mandal for women
 beesvin sadi ke armbh main striyon ko shiksha pradaan karne main european mishanri evam bhartiya samaaj-sudhaarak sabase aage the
 But most of the women were educated informally by private teachers at their home
 darasal zyaadaatar sudhaarak striyon kii shiksha ko unke gharelu dayitvon se jodna chaahate the taaki ve apane parivaar-kutumb ke laalan-paalan va jivan style main gunatmak sudhaar laa saken
 Home science was considered the best subject for this type of education
 grih-vigyaan ko bhartiya samaaj main 'ghar' kii pariklpana ke adarsh swaroop ko sthapit karne or grih-vigyaan main prashikshit striyon ko adarsh patni-maan-grih lakshmi kii bhoomika ke vaahak kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 Home science made the Indian 'home' such a laboratory under whose ambit the campaign for comprehensive reforms in the family and society could begin
 iske saath hi grih-vigyaan ko prabud-sambhrant bharatiyon main sweekaarya banane ke liye ise ek aise madhyam ke rup main prastut kiya gaya jo bhartiya striyon ko unke apane ghar main sammanneey sthaan dilaane or vyapak samaaj-sudhaar main striyon ko centrestha karne main kargar bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 The idea of home science also suited the ideal female image being promoted in the anti-colonial movement
 gandhi dwaara andolan kaa netritv sanbhaalane ke baad aam bhartiya striyon ne bhi badi sankhya main isamen hissaa lenaa shuru kiya
 Gandhi exploited the ideal selfless image of mother-wife-sister to connect women
 isi tarah hindu rashtravaadi vyakhya main bhi bharat bhoomi ko bharat mata ke rup main nirupit kiya gaya
 The Tamil language movement also featured Tamil mother and Tamil nationality as mother in Tamil Nadu
 tamil asmita ke punaruddhar or tamil gaurav ke matra rup main pradarshan ke prachaarkon ne striyon ko grih swamini or matra shakti ke rup main badhaava diya
 As a result, not only did women participate in the self-esteem movement in large numbers, but also the common people of Tamil Nadu developed awareness about women education
 tamil andolan ke sheersh netritv ne bhi striyon ke liye aise sudhaaron kii himaayat kii jinke dwaara patni va maan kii bhoomika ko prabhavakaari banaaya ja sake
 Some Indian women played a major role in the Indianisation of home science and its spread
 dhondo keshav karve ke vidhwaa ashram se sambandhit parvati bai athawale 1918 main america yatra par gayin jahaan unhone dekha ki gharelu kaary main vaigyanik tareekon kaa prayog kis tarah bharat ke liye bhi behad laabhprad ho saktaa he
 Similarly, Hansa Mehta, daughter of the Prime Minister of Baroda, studied domestic economics training in the US during 1920–21 and returned to establish a women's college at Maharaj Sayaji Rao University in which the home science curriculum was designed by American expert Ann Gilchrist
 Strong prepared

 The Women's Organization of India also conducted a program of informal training in home science and published a magazine Stridharma to disseminate information related to it
 isamen america se prakashit jarnal of home iconomics ke lekh prakashit kiye jate the
 In Madras city of Tamil Nadu, many devadasis were trained in home science with the aim of rehabilitating them in the society so that they could be employed as domestic workers
 1926 main bhartiya stri sanghathan kii kuch sadasyon ne raajnneetik swatantraaa ke sthaan par striyon kii shiksha ko apana praathmik uddeshy mana or bhartiya stri sanghathan chhod kar akhil bhartiya stri sammelan sthapit kiya
 This new group established Lady Irwin College in Delhi in 1932 to train women in home science
 bhartiya stri sanghathan kii ek sansthaapak sadsy malti patavardhan ne stridharm patrika main grih-vigyaan ke prachaar ke saath hi striyon kii saamaajik samasyaon, jaise rojgaar, stri-adhikaron se sambandhit kanoonee-sanvaidhanik parivartan, pitrusattatmak sanyukt parivaar ke vikhandan jaise vishyon ko pramukhataa se uthaaya

 They are constructed to facilitate movement in the body and mechanical basis

 Three types of treaties are found in the body in particular: immovable pact, half-joint pact and movable pact
 in sandhiyon main asthiyon ke sandhiprishthon kaa sanyog ho jaataa he
 There is no difference between the two bones
 is kaaran asthiyon ke sangam sthaan par kisi prakaar kii gati nahin ho paati
 Both bones are interconnected by fibrous tissue
 in sandhiyon main teen shreniyan pai jaati hai : In these treaties, there is cartilage between the bones and the movement is reduced
 is shrenee main do bhed paae jate hai
 The speed of these treaties is unbounded
 inamen nimnlikhit visheshtaayen pai jaati hai : 1
 The concord pages of the core pact become so friendly that the bones can only move on one axis, such as the pact of Kakuhani; 2
 vivertika sandhi main ek asthi kundal kii bhanti ban jaati he or duusari kivaad kii chul kii bhanti uske bheetar baithkar gumti he, jaise prakoshthikantar sandhi ; 3
 In the pectoral plexus, a long form is formed and the other bone becomes advanced and longitudinally
 yah bhaag pehali asthi ke gadhe main rahata he or asthiyaan snaayuon dwaara aapas main bandhi rahati hai, jaise manibandh arthath kalai kii sandhi
 These have actions like accusation, expansion, penetration, refraction, refraction etc

 Examples are the wing joint and buttock joint

 saral sandhi - iske prishth is prakaar dhale hote hai or snaayu ityadi kii sthiti aisi hoti he ki asthiyaan idhar-udhar kuch hi sarak sakati he, jaise kasheruka sandhi
 The purpose of treaties in the body is speed
 isliye inaki rachana bhi is prakaar kii he ki asthiyaan gati kar saken or saath hi apane sthaan se chyut bhi na hon
 On each joint, a fibrous or neurological cell is mounted, covering the entire treaty, at the ends of the bones participating in the treaty
 is tantustar ke vishesh bhaagon kaa vishesh vikaas ho jaataa he or ve adhik drudh ho jate hai
 These parts are called nerves, which are in different numbers in different treaties
 tantustar ke bheetar snehakastar hota he, jo asthiyon ke upar tak pahunchakar unhen dhak letaa he
 In the treaties within which the condenser disc resides, a layer of lubricant layer also extends over the condensate disc, making the lubricant fluid present between the lubricant layer and the condenser disc, in the blank of the lubricating layer
 yah snehak dravya sandhisthit asthi ke bhaagon ko chikna rakhata he or unako ragad se bachaata he
 The nerves are the long strips parallel to the fibrous tissue

 Both ends of these also lie on the unstable parts of the two bones

 The number of inner muscles is small
 yah peshiyon ko snaayuon par chadha rahata he
 There is a fluid between the two layers of these veils, which is found especially in the places where the muscle comes in contact with the bone
 isse sandhi ke kaary ke kaal main snaayuon main koi kshati nahin hone paati
 It is a membrane of different sizes, in which a thick aliphatic liquid is filled in the cell of lubricant
 yah un asthiyon ke prishthon ke bich adhik rahati he, jo ek duusare par ragad khaati hai, yaa jin sandhiyon main keval sarakane kii kriya hoti he
 The contraction and spread of muscles in each movable joint leads to the following actions: vastut: kisi vastu ke bhav tathaa gun dwaara utpann honevaale prabhaav ko preran kehete hai, jab ki donon vastuon kaa sansparsh na ho
 In this way, when an object exerts its influence on it despite being separated from the other object, it is called induction

 Electromagnetic induction vidyutsthaitik preran main koi vastu, nikatavarti vidyucchalkon par, aavesh prerit karti he
 When an electrically charged material comes close to an conductor that is insulated from the earth, some electrons of the conductor are charged and collect at one end of the conductor and charge the entire conductor
 yah kriya, vastav main aaweshit ho jate hai or chaalak ke ek sire par ekatrit hokar puure chaalak ko hi aaweshit kar dete hai
 This action is actually to charge other electrodes by induction by a charged substance and is called electrostatic induction

 After every parliamentary general election, the President gives his inaugural address at the first session of Parliament

 Additionally, any act passed in Parliament must become the President's approval to become law

 The Constitution allows the President to act only on the advice of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet
 raashtrapati, karyaalay ke liye nimna niyukt kar sakate hai: The President is vested with immunity to all his actions by Article 51 of the Constitution, and he is not liable to anyone for his actions

 Thereafter, the president is elected by open vote, and the winning candidate is announced by a parliamentary majority
 isi karanvash, vipakshi daal shaayad hi kabhi apane pratyaashee ko chunaav main namankit karaten hai
 Therefore, usually the incumbent candidate is declared unopposed
 1991 se purv, jab bangladesh ko adhyakshiya pranali ke antargat shasit kiya jaataa tha, tab, raashtrapati ko janata dwaara pratyaksh rup se nirvaachit kiya jaataa tha
 Apart from this, Parliament also has powers to impeach the President

 In two stories, Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memory, while Watson Frame narrates the story
 conan doyal ne kaha ki homes kaa charitra dow joseph bel se prerit tha, jinke liye doyal ne ek lipic ke rup main edinburgh royal infrmari main kaam kiya tha
 Like Holmes, Bell was known to draw large conclusions from small observations
 maaikel harrison ne 1971 ke ek lekh elleri queens mistry magazine main tark diya he ki yah charitra, vendale sherer se prerit tha jo ek hatya ke maamle main ek "paraamarsh jasoos" the jo kathith rup se england main 1882 main akhabaaron kii surkhiyon main chaaya rahaa
 Outside of the adventures recorded by Dr
 Watson, little is known about the biography of Sherlock Holmes and not even in the original stories of Conan Doyle; Nevertheless, relevant information about his early life and detailed family form an outline of this detective's life
 kahani hiz last bo main homes kaa janm andazan 1854 ke aas-paas lagata he; aam taur par, tarikh ko 6 janvari ke rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he
 Holmes says that when he was in the pre-graduation class, he first developed the permissions method
 Author Dorothy L
 Shares suggested that according to the information of the two exploits, Holmes would have been in Cambridge rather than Oxford and that "of all the colleges in Cambridge, Sydney Sussex probably offered the most benefits to a man like Holmes and more accurate information

 According to Holmes, a visit to the father of one of his classmates prompted him to take up espionage as a profession and he spent six years as a consulting detective after university work, until financial difficulties led him to Watson Not forced to take it as his room mate, at which point the narration of the stories begins
 1881 se, varnan he ki 221B baker street, landan, homes kaa thikaana tha jahaan se vah apni nijee jasusi agency chalaata he
 221B seventeen steps up is a flat which in an old manuscript has been called the "upper end" of the road
 dow watasan ke aane tak, homes akele kaam karata tha, kabhi-kabhaar hi shahar ke chote tabake se agenton ko niojit karata tha, jisamen dher saare mubir or bazaaru bacchon kaa ek samooh tha jise vah baker street irregulars kahata tha
 Irregulators appear in three stories, "the Sign of the Four", "A Study in Scarlet" and "the Adventure of the Crooked Man"

 It is not clear whether Holmes has other siblings

 But in such a case, he asks a woman to warn him as his sister, so it can only be a figurative language
 homes apana adhikansh vyavsaayik samay apane achche mitra or kalkram se abhilekhan karanevaale watasan ke saath saajha karte hai, jo 1887 main apni shaadi hone se pehle or apni patni kii mrityu hone ke baad punah kuch samay ke liye homes ke saath rahata he; uskaa ghar, uski makaan malkin, shrimati hadsan sambhalati hai
 Watson has two roles in Holmes's life
 pehali, vah uske maamalon ke sanchaalan main vyaavhaarik sahaayta detaa he; vah jasoos kaa dahinaa haath he, jo khoji, jhansa dene vaala, sahyogi or doot ke vibhinn roopon main kaary karata he
 Second, he is a historian of Holmes
 Most of Holmes's stories are phenomenological narratives, written from Watson's point of view as a summary of the detective's most interesting cases
 homes ko aksar watasan ke lekhan ko sansanikhez or loklubhaavan kehete hue ullikhit kiya gaya he, yah sujhaate hue ki lekh uski kala ke shuddh gananaa "vigyaan" kii nishpaksh or sateek report pesh nahin karte
 Nevertheless, Holmes's friendship with Watson is undoubtedly his most important relationship
 kai kahaniyon main, watasan ke liye homes kaa sneh- aksar uske thande, bauddhik bahya swarup ke peeche chipa hua- ujagar ho jaataa he
 "in The Adventure of the Three Garidebs, Watson is injured in a confrontation with a villain; although the bullet wound proves to be" very superficial ", Watson is elated by Holmes' response: kul milakar, homes ke taees saal sakriy rup se kaary karte rahane kaa varnan he jis dauraan watasan ne uske satraa maamalon ko lipibaddh kiya
 Holmes retires in 1903-04 to a Bee Farm in Sussex Downs where he takes the hobby of beekeeping as his primary occupation and eventually "practical Hand Book of Bee Culture, with Some Observations Upon the Segregation of the Queen "
 keval ek maamla, jo homes dwaara swayan varnit he or jisaki vah ek shaukia taur par chaan-been kar rahaa tha, jasoos kii sevanivritti ke dauraan ghatit hota he
 Holmes describes himself as "faked" in terms of habits and lifestyle
 watasan ke anusaar, homes ek sanakee he, jise saafe-safaai yaa suvyavastha ke samakaleen maanakon se koi lagaav nahin he
 In an early story, Watson describes Holmes as: jo chiz dusron ko avyavashtha-si lagati he, vah homes ko upyogi jaankariyon kaa bhandar dikhti he
 Holmes in the stories dips into his shattered web of random documents and artifacts to find exactly the specific document or anything he is looking for
 vyaktigat swatchta ke maamle main, virodhabhas swaroop, homes ko "da hound of da baskeravilles" main vyaktigat safai se ek "billi-jaisaa" pyaar karne vaala varnit kiya he
 In no way does this seem to impede the very practical pursuit of his profession, however; Holmes's first story, "A Study in Scarlet," has his hands dirty with acid stains, while Holmes later uses his own blood drops for chemical experimentation
 watasan aksar homes ke khaane kii anishchit aadaton ko chihnit karata he
 Detective is often described as starving himself during times of intense intellectual activity, as during The Adventure of the Norwood Builder, where Watson states: homes kaa itihaaskaar uske pipe upyog karne kii aadat, yaa uske cigarette or cigar, ke apekshaakrit kam prayog ko bura nahin maanata
or na hi watasan, homes dwaara ek muvakkil ke liye sach modane yaa kanoon todane kii tatparta kii ninda karata he jahaan uskaa maananaa he ki yah naitik rup se uchit he
 Holmes is depicted as a patriot, who in many stories is working on behalf of the government in matters of national security
 vah hiz last bo main counter-intelligence kaa kaary bhi karata he jo WWI kii shuruuaat main avasthit he
 As a shooting exercise, the detective has decorated the wall of his Baker Street hideout with a "VR" mark made from his pistol bullets
 homes kaa abhimaan yada-kada ghamand kaa rup le letaa he; yadhyapi auchity ke saath; vah police nirikshakon ko apane utkrisht nishkarshon se uljhaakar anand praapt karata he
 He does not aspire to fame and is generally satisfied by allowing the police to take public credit for his work
 yah aksar hi hota he ki jab watasan apni kahaniyon ko prakashit karata he, to maamle main homes kii bhoomika spasht ho jaati he
 Holmes's conduct is rendered neutral and cold
 phir bhi ek saahasik kaary ke bich, ullekhneey junun ke saath, homes chamak dikhaa saktaa he
 He has a tendency to perform and has a wide net to catch a criminal and unleash his crime, often to impress Watson or one of the Scotland Yard inspectors

 He is addicted to cocaine, which is pierced by the use of a special needle in a seven percent solution that he holds in a leather shell

 Naively, he denounces his friend's habit, describing it as "the only evil" of the detective, and expressing concern about Holmes' mental health and its potential impact on excellent intelligence
 baad kii kathaon main, watasan homes ko drugs se dur karne kaa daawa karte hai
 Nevertheless, according to his medical friend, Holmes remains an addict whose habit was "not dead, but sleeping only
" " Although he initially needs Watson to share the rent of his comfortable residence at 221B Baker Street, in "the Adventure of the Dying Detective", Watson reveals, "I have no doubt when Holmes lived alone" That the house would probably have been bought at the price that Holmes pays for his room, "pointing out that he generated a good income from his behavior, though it was properly He did not know how much he charged for his services
 vah "da problem of thor brij" main yah zarur kahata he ki "meraa peshewar shulk ek nishchit str par he

 " yah ek aise sandarbh main kaha gaya he jab ek graahak ne usko uski fees kaa duguna dene kii peshkash kii; lekin, yah sambhav he ki dhani graahak homes ko uske maanak shulk se kaafii zyaada paarishramik pradaan karte hai: "da adventure of da final problem" main homes kahata he ki france kii sarkaar or scandenevia ke shahi nivas ne uski sevaaon ke liye use paryaapt dhan diya he jisase vah aaraam se ritair ho saktaa he, jabaki "da adventure of blike peter" main watasan ne ingit kiya he ki homes, amir or taqatvar logon kii madad se inkaar kar detaa tha yadi usko unka maamla pasand nahin aata, jabaki atyadhik vinamr graahakon ke maamalon ke liye vah puure saptaah kaa samay samarpit kar detaa tha
 In "A Case of Identity", Holmes also tells Watson that after "A Scandal in Bohemia", the King of Bohemia gave him a golden snuff box and received a magnificent ring from the Dutch royal family; In "the Adventure of the Bruce - Partington Plans", Holmes receives an emerald tie-pin from Queen Victoria
 homes ke maamalon ke anya smriti chihn hai ireni edler se praapt sone kii ginni or france ke raashtrapati kaa ek hastakshrit dhanyavad patr or huret naam ke ek hatyare ko pakadvane ke liye lejan of honor da adventure of da golden pins-nez "da adventure of da priari skool" main homes ullas ke saath apana haath malataa he" jab holdernes kaa duk raashi ko likhata he, jisase watasan ko bhi aashcharya hota he or uske baad check ko thapki detaa he, yah kah kar ki "main ek garib aadmi hum," ek ghatana jise homes kii vidambnaapurna hasya kii pravriti ke rup main kaarij kiya ja saktaa he
 Certainly, during his career, Holmes worked for both the most powerful kings and governments of Europe and various wealthy nobles and industrialists and was also approached for advice by poor moneylenders and humble teachers of the lower ranks of society
 apane kharchon ke liye homes, graahakon se paise vasuulata he or samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye prastaavit kisi bhi inaam kaa daawa kar saktaa he: vah "da adventure of da specold band" main kahata he ki miss stoner uske dwaara kiye gaye kharche ko de saktin hai or anurodh karata he ki "da red-heded lig" bank, uske dwaara maamle par kiye gaye kharche kii bharpai kare
 "da adventure of da beril coronet main chori hue ratna ko punah praapt karne main ai laagat kaa bhugtan karne ke liye homes ke paas uskaa amir banker graahak he or vah us inam par bhi daawa karata he jo us banker ne khojane vaale ke liye ghoshit kiya tha
 The only woman to influence Holmes was Irene Adler, who was always referred to by Holmes as "the woman"
 homes ko khud is shabd kaa sidhe prayog karte hue uddhrut nahin kiya gaya he- bhale hi vah anya maamalon main uskaa asli naam kai baar letaa he
 Adler is one of the few women cited in all of Holmes's stories, although she actually appears in only one story, "A Scandal in Bohemia
" ek kahani main, "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" shaadi ke liye homes kii mangani ho jaati he, lekin keval apane maamle ke liye jaankaree jutaney kii ichha se
vah raste main aane vaali bahut adhik aakarshak mahila graahakon ke prati spasht ruchi darshata he, 
 homes ne anivaary rup se "apane graahak main aage koi ruchi nahin dikhaai jab vah uski ek samasya ke centre se baahar chali gai
 "holmes found his youth, beauty and energy distinct from any romantic interest, appealing
 aise prakaran homes ke aakarshan ko darshaate hai, abhi tak edler ke maamle ke alaava, kisi gambhir yaa dirghakaalik lagaav kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Watson wrote that Holmes "hates women" but "has a bizarre way of finding favor", with Holmes saying, "I am not a fan of the feminine heart"; In fact, he finds "the intention of women 


 so cryptic 


 how can you build on such a deceptive object? Their smallest action can cost a lot
" 

 unka sabase asaadhaaran vyavhaar baalo ke ek pin par nirbhar kar saktaa he
 "however, Doyle recalled Joseph Bell saying," Holmes Babbage is just as inhuman as the calculating machine and with all the possibility of falling in love
 " Another interesting aspect of Holmes's relationship with women is that the source of the pleasure he gets from his company is the problems he brings
 sin of da four main, watasan ne homes ko "ek yantra maanav, ek gananaa mashin," ke rup main uddhrut kiya he or homes ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he,"yah sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he, ki apane faisle ko vyaktigat gunon dwaara purvaagrahagrast hone kii anumati nahin deni chahie
ek graahak mere liye maatr ek ikai he, - samasya main ek kaarak

" yah saamaanya rup se mahilaon ke saath or vishesh rup se muvakkil ke saath homes kii sambandh banane main anichhaa ko sanderbhit karata he, jaisaa ki watasan ne kaha "kabhi-kabhi tumhaare andar ek sakaaratmak amanviyata dikhti he
 At the end of "the Adventure of the Devil's Foot," Holmes says: "I have never loved Watson, but if i did, and if the woman i loved had an end, i might have been one of my willing lions Behaves like a hunter
 "in the story, investigator Dr
 Sterndale kills the man who killed his girlfriend, Brenda Tragenis, in order to exact an exact revenge that the law could not provide
 La
 "in The Adventure of the Dying Detective, Watson writes that Mrs
 Hudson likes Holmes in her own way, despite her cynical eccentricity as a tenant, due to her remarkably gentle and courteous behavior with women
" In The Sign of the Four, Watson once again quotes Holmes as saying, "I won't tell them too much
" Never trust women completely, homes kii praathmik bauddhik tahakikat vidhi he ek aparaadh ke samaadhaan kaa anumiti tark "pani kii ek boond se", vah likhata he, "ek taarkik vyakti atlantic yaa niagara kii sambhaavna kaa anumaan laga saktaa he bina ek ko dekhe yaa duusare ko sune
"homes kii kahaniyaan aksar uski "anumiti" kii sahaspurn pratibha ke pradarshan ke saath shuru hoti hai
 It is of little interest to logicians and those interested in logic to try to analyze what Holmes is doing during his permissions
 prathit hota he ki homiya anumiti, nishkarsh nikaalane se nirmit he jo praathmik rup se yaa to sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton par aadhaarit he jo satark aagamanaatmak adhyayan kaa parinaam he jaise ki vibhinn prakaar ke cigar kii raakh kaa homes kaa adhyayan athwa sarvottam vivaran se prasphutit nishkarsh he
 The form of Holmes's straight-line pragmatics is generally, "if 'p', then 'q', where 'p' is the visible proof and 'q' is what the evidence indicates
 lekin vahaan madhyavarti siddhant bhi hai, jaisaa ki nimna udhaaharan main dekha ja saktaa he
 In "A Scandal in Bohemia" Holmes permits that Watson was very wet recently and that her "maid girl was very clumsy and careless"
 When surprised, Watson asks how Holmes knows this
 Holmes answers: is maamle main, homes ne kai jude siddhanton kaa prayog kiya: By explicitly applying such principles, Holmes is able to infer that: "watasan ke juute ke kinare, kai saamanantar kataav se chhile hue hai"; se "watasan kii naukaraani foohad or laaparvaah he"; or "watasan haal hi main bahut geela rahaa he or gande mausam main baahar gaya tha
 " anumiti tark homes ko prabhaavshaalee dhang se ek ajanabi ke vyavsaay kaa khulaasa karne main sakasham banaate hai, jaise ki a study in skarlet main marine ke ek sevanivrutt sargent; da red-heded lig main ek jahaaj kaa purv badhai jo mahajan ban gaya; or ek billiard-marker or da adventure of da greek interprator main ek topakhane kaa sevanivrutt NCO
 isi tarah, nirjeev vastuon kaa adhyayan karke, homes unke maalikon ke bare main ascharyajanak vistrut nishkarsh nikaalane main sakasham he, jisamen shaamil he da sin of da four main watasan kii jeb-ghadi or saath hi saath anya kahaniyon main ek topi, ek pipe, or ek chadi
 Once he has accumulated a lot of evidence and allowed possible interpretations and to present a solution, Holmes moves to one interpretation that matches all the facts of the case
 jaisaa ki homes watasan ko bataata he, "jab tumne asambhav ko hataa diya, to jo bhi bachaa, haalanki asambhavit, avashya sach hona chahie
" Holmes demonstrates a keen interest in acting and making pseudo-vests
 kai kahaniyon main, vah saboot ikattha karne ke liye itnaa swaabhaavik chhadam vesh dhaaran karata he ki watasan bhi use nahin pakad paata, jaisaa ki "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" main, da main wyeth da twisted lip or a scandle in bohemia main
anya karnaamon main, homes apane maamle ko prabhavi banane ke liye ghayal hone kaa yaa biimaar hone kaa bahaanaa karata he, yaa shaamil logon ko doshi tehraata he, jaise "da adventure of da daaing detective" main
 Pistol Holmes and Watson carry pistols with them; Often his old service revolver in Watson's case
 haalanki, watasan keval saat maukon par in hathiyaaron ke istemaal kii charchaa karata he
 'stick Holmes as a gentleman, often walking with a stick or stick
 watasan dwaara use lakdi kii talwaar main visheshgy varnit kiya gaya he or vah do baar apni chadi kaa upyog ek hathiyaar ke rup main karata he
 In Talwar a Study in Scarlett, Watson describes Holmes as an expert in swordsmanship — though in no story Holmes has used the sword
 "gloria scot" main isaki charchaa he ki homes ne talwaar kaa abhyaas kiya he
 Whip In many stories, Holmes appears armed with a whip
 da adventure of da specold band main iskaa prayog vah ek jahrile saanp ko maarane ke liye karata he or a cese of aaidentity main usase ek thag ko maarane ke liye kareeb aata he
 Holmes, using a "whip" in "the red-headed League", drops a pistol from John Clay's hands
 mukkebaazi homes nangi ungaliyon se ek vikat ladaaku ke rup main varnit he
 In The Sign of the Four, Holmes introduces himself to a professional boxer as: kahaniyon main kai avasaron par homes, ubharate hue apane pratidwandviyon ke saath guttham-guttha ladaai main uljhe, jahaan ve anivaary rup se vijeta rahe
 "gloria scot" main yah doharaaya gaya he ki homes ek mukkebaaz ke rup main prashikshit he
 In the martial arts The Adventure of the Empty House, Holmes tells Watson how he overcame Professor Moriart by using martial arts and slamming his adversary on the Raishenbach Falls
 vah kahata he ki "haalanki, mujhe kuch gyaan he, baritsu, kaa yaa kushti kii japani pranali kaa, jo kai baar mere liye bahut upyogi sabit hui he
 The name "baritsu" appears to be a reference to real-life martial arts Bartitsu
 pehali hi kahani a study in skarlet main, homes kii prishthbhumi ke bare main kuch diya gaya he
 In the first half of 1881, he was introduced as an independent student of chemistry with many diverse inquisitive interests, almost all of which appeared to him to be better at solving crimes
 An early story, "the Adventure of the" Gloria Scott "", provides more background for who influenced Holmes to become a detective: The father of a college friend gave him a brownish appreciation of his permissiveness skills
 Holmes strictly follows the scientific method and emphasizes the power of arguments and observation and permissiveness
 a study in skarlet main, homes kaa daawa he vah nahin jaanata ki prithvi surya ke chaaron ore gumti he, chunki is tarah kii jaankaree uske kaam ke liye apraasangik he
 After hearing this fact directly from Watson, he says that he will immediately try to forget her
 He states that he believes that the brain has a limited capacity to store information and therefore learning redundant will only reduce its ability to learn useful things
 Dr
 Watson later assesses Holmes' ability to is: yahaan tak ki a study in skarlet ke ant main, yah dikhaaya gaya he ki homes latin jaanata he or mul roman sukhtiyon ke anuwaad kii koi jarurat nahin padati, haalanki jasusi kaary ke liye bhashaa ke gyaan kii pratyaksh upyogita ndehpurn he
 Later stories also refute the list
 homes kii raajnneeti se sambhavit agyanta ke baavjood "a scandle in bohemia" main vah tathakthith "count won kram" kii asli pahchaan ko turant bhaanp jaataa he
 In relation to non-sensational literature, his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, even Goethe
 iske alaava, da adventure of da bruce- partington plance main watasan suchit karata he ki navambar 1895 main, "homes khud ko ek vinibandh main dubaa letaa he jo usne poliphonic motets of lasus se liya tha"- ek atyadhik gudh kshetra, jiske liye homes ko apni smriti ko jaankaree ke ek vishaal bhandar se, jiskaa kii aparaadh kii ladaai se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, avyavasthit karnaa hoga- itnaa vyapak gyaan ki uske vinibandh ko is vishay par "antim alphaz" mana jaataa he
 Later narratives refute the notion that Holmes is unwilling to know anything unless it is immediately relevant to his occupation; In the second chapter of The Valley of Fear, Holmes would rather declare that "all knowledge is useful to the detective" and at the end of The Adventure of the Lions Men he calls himself "an all-in-one of memory with bizarre conception
" The subject reader defines as "
 " Holmes is also a competent code specialist
 vah watasan ko sambodhit karata he,"main kuta lekhan ke sabhi roopon se kaaphi parichit hum or is vishay par ek tuchh vinibandh kaa main khud lekhak hum, jisamen main ek sau saath alag sankethik shabdon kaa vishleshan kar rahaa hum
" aisi hi ek yojana aavriti vishleshan ke prayog se da adventure of da daancing main main hal hoti he
 Holmes's analysis of physical evidence is both scientific and accurate
 uske tareekon main shaamil he avyakt print kaa prayog jaise pairon ke nishaan or khur print or cycle patariyaan, ek aparaadh sthal par karrwai kii pahchaan karne ke liye, aparaadhiyon ko pahchaanane ke liye tambaakoo kii raakh or cigarette ke turron kaa prayog, ek dhokhadhadi kaa pardaafash karne ke liye tip patron kii tulana, do hatyaron ko benakaab karne ke liye barood avasheshon kaa prayog ", do aparaadh sthalon se praapt goli kii tulana or yahaan tak ki ungaliyon ke nishaan kaa shuruaati prayog 
 a scandle in bohemia main homes ne manovigyaan ke gyaan kaa bhi pradarshan kiya he, jahaan usne ireni edler ko tasviir chhipaane ke sambandh main dhokhaa dene ke liye phuslaaya, jo is "aadhaar" par tikaa tha ki aag lagane kii sthiti main ek avivaahit mahila apni sabase keemtee chiz chaahegi jabaki ek shaadishuda aurat apane bachche kii taraf jhapategi
pehali kahani, a study in skarlet main, homes puraane khun ke daag kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek rasinic prakriya kii khoj kaa daawa karata he- haalanki vibhinn prakaar ke rakt kai saal baad tak pahachaane nahin jate the
 Despite the excitement of his life, Holmes retires to beekeeping Sussex Downs and writes a book on the subject, "practical Hand Book of Be Culture, with Some Observations Upon the Segregation of the Queen
 His search for relaxation in his music
 Can also be seen in love, especially in The red-headed League, where Holmes, taking leave from the case one evening, heard the violin of Pablo de Saraste Is obtained

 There are fifty-six short stories written by Conan Doyle and four novels called Law by Homian
 is kanoon ke praarambhik vidwaanon main britain ke ronaald nox or neuyork ke christopher morle shaamil hai
 As a tribute, more or less the authors have created many pop culture references from Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle, or the characters in the stories
 is tarah ke sanket ek kathanak ke vikaas kaa kaary karte hai, hisse ke bauddhik str ko badha sakate hai yaa ek chaukas darshak ke liye easter andey ke rup main vyavhaar kar sakate hai
 Some have been outspoken who presented Holmes as a character in a new setting, or a slightly more subtle hint, such as building a logical character while living in an apartment number 221B
 a well-known example of this is Gregory House's character in the House MD show, whose name and apartment number both refer to Holmes
 sabase aasaan sandarbh aksar yah hota he ki jo bhi kisi tarah kaa jasusi kaam karata he use shikari topi or clok kii poshak pahana dena
 pop samskruti ke sandarbh main ek or samrudh kshetra he homes kaa vansh or santaan, lekin vastav main lekhak kii kalpana keval seemaa he
 a third major reference is a quote, "this is easy, my dear Watson,"
 Another erroneous credit is generally given that Holmes is not explicitly described in the entire novel series, wearing a hunter hat
 " haalanki, homes ne ek kaan tak latakati yatra topi "da adventure of silver blez" main zarur pahani he
 Sidney Paget first depicted Holmes in The Hunters Hat and Inverness Cap in The Boscombe Valley Mystery and many other later stories
 homes ke prashansak 1891 se 1894 tak kii avadhi ko- "da adventure of da final problem main homes ke gaayab hone or sambhavit maut or phir "da adventure da adventure of da empti house" main punah prakat hone ke bich kaa samay- "mahaan antaraal" ke rup main ullikhit karte hai
 It is notable, however, that a later narration of a story in 1892 is described
 conan doyal ne kahaniyon kaa pehla set ek dashak ke dauraan likhaa
apane aitihaasik upanyaason ke liye or adhik samay dene kii ichha se unhone "da final problem" main homes ko maar daalaa, jo 1893 main prakashit hui

 haalanki janata kahani se prasann hui, lekin ek maranoparant homes se vah santusht nahin thi or isliye conan doyal ne do saal baad homes ko punerjeevit kiya
 Many considered Doyle's intention to bring Holmes alive, most notably writer-director Nicholas Meyer, who wrote an essay on the subject titled "the Great Man Takes a Speech" in the 1970s
 The real reason is not known
 Are, apart from the obvious: publishers offered to pay generously
 Whatever the reason, Conan Doyle continued to write Holmes stories for a quarter century
 kuch lekhakon ne antaraal ke liye anya spashtikaran die hai
 In Meyer's novel The seven-per-saint Solution, the interval is shown as a secret sabbatical when Holmes treats Sigmund Freud's cocaine addiction and presents Holmes with the pleasing suggestion that Watson Claiming that he has been killed by morirt, he will present a fictional account and say about the people, "they never wish you any good Vas will not
