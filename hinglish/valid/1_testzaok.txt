 Assamese is not the only dialect in its state
 yah pramukhtah maidaanon kii bhashaa he
 For a long time, there has been an attempt to prove Assamese a subpoena of Bengali
 asamiya kii tulana main bangala bhashaa or sahitya ke bahumukhi prasar ko dekhakar hi log is prakaar kii dhaaran banaate rahe hai
 But from the linguistic point of view, parallel development of Bangla and Assamese can be easily seen
 magadhi apbhransh ke ek hi strot se nicksruth hone ke kaaran donon main samantaayein ho sakati hai, par unke aadhaar par ek duusari kii boli siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In terms of regional expansion, several sub-forms of Assamese are found
 inamen se do mukhya hai - purvi rup or pashchimi rup
 In terms of literary usage, the eastern form is considered the standard
 purvi kii apeksha pashchimi rup main boligat vibhinnataayen adhik hai
 In these two main forms of Assamese, sound, grammar and vocabulary find differences from these three views
 asamiya ke shabdasmooh main sanskrit tatsam, tadbhav tathaa deshaj ke atirikt videshi bhashaaon ke shabd bhi milte hai
 The number of words adopted from non-aryan languages is also not small
 bhashaa main saamanyat: tadbhav shabdon kii pradhanta he
 The words of Persian, Arabic and Portuguese and some other European languages have also come through Hindi Urdu
 bhartiya aryabhashaon kii shrunkhlaa main purvi seemaa par sthit hone ke kaaran asamiya kai anarya bhashapariwaron se ghiri hui he
 Being a border language at this level, words from many sources of non-aryan languages are found in its vocabulary
 in sroton main se teen apekshaakrit adhik mukhya hai : In the context of this mixed group of terms, it would be appropriate to clarify that Khasi, Bodo and Thai elements have been borrowed in Assamese, but the mixture of Malayan and Kolar elements is a result of the traditional mixture of Muladhara in these languages
 anarya bhashaaon ke prabhaav ko assam ke anek sthannaamon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he

 Even the systematic form of the Assamese language from the 13th and 14th centuries can be seen in its "chariyapad" of Buddhist Siddhas
 "charyaapad" kaa samay vidwaanon ne isvi san 600 se 1000 ke bich sthir kiya he
 Some of the authors of these couplets, Siddhas, had a close relationship with the Kamrup state

 Keeping in view the linguistic features, three periods of Assamese development can be considered: 14veen shatabdi se 16veen shatabdi ke ant tak
 This period can then be divided into two eras: the pre-vaishnava "era" and the Vaishnavite
 is yug ke sabhi lekhakon main bhashaa kaa apana swaabhaavik rup nikhar aayaa he, yadhyapi kuch pracheen prabhaavon se vah sarvatha mukt nahin ho saki he
 Grammatically there is not enough uniformity in the language

 Bhattadeva gave Assamese prose literature a structured look

 pariksha ke vishleshnatmak-lekhan khand ke donon nibandhon main prayek ko 0 se 6 ke paimaane par darja diya jaataa he

 It tests quantitative ability by using an unusual set of instructions
 parikshaarthi ko ek prashn diya jaataa, jisase do kathan jude hote hai or jinamein di gai soochna, us sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke liye upyogi ho sakati he
 The examinee then has to determine whether one statement is sufficient to answer the question; Whether both are needed to answer the question; Or, is there not enough information given to answer the question
 ankada-paryaaptta, GMAT ke liye visheshtah taiyaar adwitiya ganit kaa sawaal he

 vaakya-sudhaar madon main ek vaakya hota he jiskaa puraa yaa ek hissaa rekhaankit hota he tathaa vaakya ke neeche paanch sambandhit vaikalpik uttar soochibaddh hote hai
 The first alternative answer is exactly what is underlined in the sentence
 shesh chaar vaikalpik uttar main rekhaankit hisse se alag vaakyansh hote hai
 If there is no defect in the words of the sentence, the candidate is suggested to choose the first alternative answer
 agar is vaakya kii mul vaakya-rachana main koi dosha ho, to parikshaarthi ko shesh chaar vaikalpik uttar main se uttam vaikalpik uttar ke chayan kaa suzav diya jaataa he
 Sentence-correction questions are designed to measure the skill of the examinee in three areas - correct expression, effective expression and correct word-selection skills
 sahi abhivyakti se taatpary vyakaran or vaakya-sanrachana se hota he
 Effective expression refers to the clarity and conciseness used to convey ideas

 Questions may be asked to draw conclusions from the examinee, identify assumptions, or identify the strengths and weaknesses of the argument in which brief statements or arguments are presented and asked to evaluate the form and content of the argument or statement
 is

 prayek anuchhed main uski vishay-vastu ke aadhaar par teen yaa usase adhik prashn hote hai
 Questions can be asked about the main point of the paragraph, about the author's specific statement, about the logical conclusion emanating from the article, and about the author's mindset or style
 "kul prapthank" main, jo parimanatmak or maukhik khandon se milakar banataa he, vishleshnatmak-lekhan moolyankan shaamil nahin he or iskaa vistaar 200 se 800 ke bich he

 The 2005 / 2006 average score was 533
 parimanatmak or maukhik khandon main ek computer-anukulak pariksha shaamil he
 The first question can be difficult
 prayek khand main agle kuch prashn 500 ke str ke aas-paas ho sakate hai
 If the examinee answers correctly, the next questions become difficult
 or yadi parikshaarthi galat jawaab detaa he to agle prashn aasaan ho jate hai, ye prashn, prashnon ke ek vishaal bhandar se uthaa kar, vidyaman prapthank ke aadhaar par chaatr ko die jate hai
 These questions are updated regularly, so that students entering these questions are prevented from reaching unnecessary benefits
 keval parikshaarthi dwaara die gaye pichley prashn ke uttar par hi antim prapthank aadhaarit nahin hote hai 
 ank arjeet karne ke liye prayukt elgoritham isse bhi adhik jatil he
 The candidate may make a small mistake and give an incorrect answer and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly
 If the candidate fails to answer the first question, it is not necessary that his marks will be reduced to half
 iske alaava, rikt chode gaye prashn parikshaarthi ke liye, prashnon ke galat uttar se zyaada takalifdeh hai
 This is in sharp contrast to the SAT, which has penalties for wrong answers
 prayek pariksha khand main kai prayogtmak prashn bhi shaamil hote hai, jinhen parikshaarthi ke praptankon main joda nahin jaataa he, lekin bhavi pariksha kii auchity ko jaanchane ke liye shaamil kiya jaataa hai

 autotransafarmar ek aisi sanrachana vaala transafarmar hota he jisamen keval ek hi vinding hoti he
 Some parts of the same winding act as primary and some parts work as second winding
 at: is akeli vinding main kam se kam teen vidyutiya sire hote hai
 Such transformer is smaller in size and weight than normal transformer with similar KVA rating
 kintu isamen primary or secondari ke bich isolation nahin miltaa jo kahin-kahin anivaary rup se aavashyak hoti he
 An autotransformer has only one winding with two or more terminals in the middle of the two ends
 primary ko do antim chhoron ke bich lagaaya jaataa he
 The output voltage is taken between a terminal and an end terminal
 is transformar kii puri vinding ke prayek turn main samaan voltage hota he, chaahe vah turn primary main ho yaa secondari main
 In autotransformer, some current from the primary moves the load directly
 v 1 v 2 = n 1 n 2 = a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {V_{1}}{V_{2}}}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{n_{2}}}=a} The ampere-turns provided by the upper half: f u = i 1 = n 1 i 1 { \ displaystyle F_{U}=I_{1}=N_{1}I_{1}} The ampere-turns provided by the lower half: f l = n 2 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle F_{L}=N_{2}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{a}}} For ampere-turn balance, FU = FL: n 1 i 1 = n 1 a { \ displaystyle N_{1}I_{1}={ \ frac {n_{1}}{a}}} Therefore: i 1 i 2 = 1 a { \ displaystyle { \ frac {I_{1}}{I_{2}}}={ \ frac {1}{a}}} The size of an autotransformer is smaller than a two-way transformer of the same size
 ye bhi autotransformar hi hote hai lekin isamen output ek niyat bindu se nahin liya gaya hota he balki vinding par phisalkar chalane vaale ek carbon brush ke madhyam se liya gaya hota he
 This has the advantage that any voltage can be achieved within a range in the output
 is kaaran iskaa upyog anek yuktiyon ke pareekshan main hota he
 For example, it can be used to light a bulb less or more intensively than necessary
 isi tarah iskaa upyog motor ko 'soft sturt' karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 By controlling its brush automatically, a voltage-stabilizer is also made from it

 Fear of individual centricity: - With the election of Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly together, the national parties can come to the polls by declaring a candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 In this case, the entire election campaign can be centered around the person
 Would like to see on the post
 Will vote in the assembly elections in favor of his party

 Murdahiya is an autobiography of Dalit litterateur Dr
 Tulsiram, through which the author has tried to expose to the truth and bitter reality related to his life by breaking the bound norms of literature in Dalit autobiographies for many years, which He himself suffered
 bhartiya darshan ke chah prakaaron main se sankhya bhi ek he jo prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 It is a philosophy with absolutely opposite beliefs from Advaita Vedanta
 isaki sthapana karne vaale mul vyakti kapil kahe jate hai
 The literal meaning of 'sankhya' is 'numerical' or analysis
 isaki sabase pramukh dharna sristi ke prakruti-purush se bani hone kii he, yahan prakruti jad he or purush chetan
 The principles of shiva-shakti of the Shaktas, the energy sources of the Yoga scriptures, are seen in parallel
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shaanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 isaki lokapriyata kaa kaaran ek yah avashya rahaa he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the asymmetry of the world on the basis of the satta, rajas and tamas elements of different religions seems very wise
 kisi loukik samasya ko ishwar kaa niyam na maanakar in prakrutiyon ke talmail bigadane or jeevon ke purusharth na karne ko kaaran bataaya gaya he
 That is, the greatest greatness of Sankhya philosophy is that the origin of creation in it is not considered by God but it has been understood as a developmental process and it is believed that the creation after passing through many stages, in its present form Has been received
 kapilacharya ko kai anishvaravaadi maanate hai par bhagavadagita or satyarthprakash jaise granthon main is dharna kaa nishedh kiya gaya he
 The mainstay of Sankhya philosophy is hospitality
 is siddhanth ke anusaar, bina kaaran ke kaary kii utpatti nahin ho sakati
 As a result, this world has its origin from zero, not from any fundamental entity
 yah siddhanth baudhon ke shoonyavad ke vipareet he
 Work remains in the full cause of its origin
 kaary apane kaaran kaa saar he
 Work and reason are express and latent forms of virtually the same process
 satkaryawad ke do bhed hai- parinamwad tathaa vivartvaad
 Consequentialism implies that reason is transformed into action in real form
 jaise til tel main, doodh dahi main roopantarit hota he
 According to discourse, change is real rather than real
 jaise-rassi main sarp kaa abhas hona
 Sankhya philosophy was very popular and famous in ancient times
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 vastut: sankhya darshan kisi samay atyant lokapriy ho gaya tha
 Whatever may be the reasons for its popularity, but one must have seemed that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by reposing the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale satvon, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat ke vaishamy kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada nyaayayukt tathaa buddhigamya prathit hota he
 The word "samkhya" is derived by adding the atomic suffix to the word "number" and the etymology of the word number is samachaksham dhatiya khyan darshanya suffix top, according to which it means Samyakti Khyati, Sadhu Darshan or True Knowledge
 sankhyacharyon kii yah samyak khyaati, unka yah satya gyaan vyaktavyakt rup dwividh achit tatv se purush rup chit tatv ko pruthak jaan lene main nihit he
 The man remains virtually untouched even if he appears to be stained in the prapancha from the top
 usamen aasakt yaa lipt dikhaai padane par bhi vastut: anasakt yaa nirlypt rahata he--sankhyacharyon kii yah sabase badi darshanik khoj unheen ke shabdon main satvapurushanyatakhyati, vivek khyaati, vyaktavyaktjvvigyaan, aadi naamon se vyavahrut hoti he
 With this wisdom, people believe in accomplishing the ultimate effort or goal of human life
 is prakaar "sankhya", shabd sankhyacharyon kii sabase badi darshanik khoj kaa vaastavik swaroop prakat karne vaala sankshipt naam he jiske sarvapratham vyaakhyaata hone ke kaaran unki vichaardhaara atyant pracheen kaal main "sankhya" naam se abhihit hui
 The term "samkhya" is also considered to be a fallacy from the word "number"
 mahabharat main sankhya ke vishay main aae hue ek shloke main ye donon hi prakaar ke bhav prakat kiye gaye hai
 It is as follows - Number Prakurvate Chave Prakriti Prakrakshate
 tattwani c chatuvinshad ten sankhya: prakirtita:
 The meaning of this is that the number which preaches the wisdom of nature and man, which imparts the effect of nature and the number which determines the number twenty-four of the elements, are called Sankhya
 kuch logon kii aisi dharna he ki gnanarthak "sankhya" shabd se kii jane vaali gaun sankhya main prakruti evam purush ke vivek gyaan se hi jivan ke param lakshya kaivalya yaa moksh kii siddhi maani gai he, at: us gyaan kii prapti hi mukhya he or is kaaran se usee par sankhya kaa sara bal he
 Sankhya assumes twenty-four elements, it is just a statement of a common fact, hence secondary
 udaiveer shastri ne apane "sankhya darshan kaa itihaas" naamak granth main sankhya shaastra ke kapil dwaara pranit hone main bhagwat 3-25-1 par shridhar swami kii vyakhya ko uddhrut karte hue is prakaar likhaa he- antim shloke kii vyakhya karte hue vyakhyaakaar ne spasht likhaa he- tatwanaa sankhyata ganak: sankhya-pravartak ityarth:
 This makes it certain that this Kapil is the innovator or prophet of Sankhya
 shridhar swami ke ganak: shabd par shastri ji ne neeche die gaye footnot main is prakaar likhaa he- madhya kaal ke kuch vyakhyakaaron ne "sankhya" pad main "sankhya" shabd ko gananaaparak samajhakar is prakaar ke vyaakhyaan kiye hai
 In fact, it means elemental knowledge
 parantu gaharaai se vichaar karne par yah baat utani saamaanya yaa gaun nahin he jitani apatat: prathit hoti he
 It seems that in very early times when the number of elements could not be fixed in the initial stage of philosophical development, then Sankhya first tried the subtle metaphysics of this visible physical world, which in turn resulted in the number of elements present in its origin
 : Was determined twenty four
 inamen bhi pratham tatv jise unhone "prakruti" yaa "pradhan" naam diya, shesh taees kaa mul siddh kiya gaya
 This same element "nature" was considered to be the result of the Chish Purush, resulting in twenty-three different elements respectively and generating the entire root world
 is prakaar tatv sankhya ke nirdhaaran ke peeche sankhyon kii bahut badi bauddhik sadhana chhipi hui prathit hoti he
 After all, how would it have been possible to determine the number of elements through micro-intelligence without thinking and analyzing for a long time? uparyukt vivechan se aisa nishchay hota he ki sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam donon hi prakaaron se uske buddhivaadee tarkpradhan hone kaa suchak he
 Even considering the basic nature of the figures and the Chit Purush both of the basic elements as proven by the Agama or Shruti proof, it is also evident to prove it mainly on the basis of conjecture proof
 aaj kal uplabdh sankhya pravachan sutara evam sankhyakarik, in donon hi moulik sankhya granthon ko dekhne se spasht gyaat hota he ki inamen sankhya ke donon hi moulik tatwon- prakruti evam purush kii satta hetuon ke aadhaar par anumaan dwaara hi siddh kii gai he
 Tips are also given in the man's plurality
 satkaryawad kii sthapana bhi tarkon ke hi aadhaar par kii gai he
 
 is prakaar sankhya shaastra kaa shravan, jo vivek gyaan kaa muladhar he, tark pradhan he
 Contemplation is the contemplation of facts and principles scripted by long-term arguments
 is prakaar jis sankhya yaa vivek gyaan ke kaaran sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam padaa, uskaa vishesh sambandh tark or buddhivaadita se he
 Due to this rationalism, some theories of Sankhya philosophy developed very independently from the Vedic sect in the later period, due to which the Acharyas like Badarayana Vyasa and Shankaracharya refuted it and even said it to the vedic sect
 yah sampradaay apane mul main to avaidic nahin prathit hota or apane parvarti rup main bhi sarvatha avaidic nahin he
 The famous commentator Vigyanbhukta has also considered Sankhya to be the contemplation of Agama or Shruti by the arguments of Satta
 unhone apane sankhya pravachan-sutara-bhashya kii avataranika main yahi baat is prakaar kahi he- jo "akodwitiya:" ityadi purush vishyak veda vachan jeev kaa sara abhiyaan dur karke use mukt karaane ke liye us purush ko sarv prakaar ke vaishamry- rupabhed se rahit bataate hai unheen veda vachanon ke arth ke manan ke liye apekshit sad yuktiyon kaa upadesh karne ke liye sankhyakarta narayanavatar bhagwaan kapil aavirbhoot hue the
 Science is clear from the monk's earlier discourses that he considers Sankhya Shastra as Vedanusari
 unka spasht mat he ki "akodwitiyah" ityadi veda vachanon ke arth kaa hi vah sad yuktiyon evam tarkon dwaara samarthan karata he, uskaa pratipaadan or vivechan karke use bodhgamy banaata he
 Vigyanbhuk has actually expressed his aforesaid opinion by following the earlier tradition prevalent in folk
 atyant pracheen kaal se hi mahabharat, gita, ramayana, smritiyon tathaa puraanon main sarvatra sankhya kaa na keval ucch gyaan ke rup main ullekh bhar hua he, apitu uske siddhanton kaa yatra-tatra vistrut vivaran bhi hua he
 In the Gita too, the trinitarian principle of Sankhya philosophy has been adopted very beautifully
 "trigunatmika prakruti nity parinamini he
 His three qualities always produce some or the other result, man is a non-believer "- this principle of Samkhya has become an essential part of Gita's Nishkam Karmayoga
 isi prakaar anyatra bhi sankhya darshan ke anek siddhant anya darshanon ke siddhanton ke poorak rup se pracheen sanskrit vadmay main drushtigochar hote hai
 From all these things, it seems that this philosophy has been Vedic in its origin, not impersonal, because if the truth were contrary to this, Vedaprana would not have given the above mentioned area for so much propagation of Samkhya in this country
 is anishvarwad, prakruti purush dwaitvaad, parinamwad aadi tathakthith veda viruddh siddhanton ke kaaran vedabaahya kahkar iskaa khandan karne vaale vedant bhashyakaar shankaracharya ko bhi brahmasutra 2
1
3 ke bhashya main likhnaa hi padaa ki "aadhyaatmavishyak anek smritiyon ke hone par bhi sankhya yoga smritiyon ke hi niraakaran main praytn kiya gaya
 Because both of them are famous as the means of ultimate effort in the world, are acclaimed by the saintly great men and consist of "linga", "tatkaranam Sankhya Yogabhishannam Gyatva Deva and Muchyatee Sarvapashai: Ya, etc
 " swayan bhashyakaar ke apane sakshya se bhi spasht he ki unke purvavarti sutarakaar ke samay main bhi anek shisht purush sankhya darshan ko vaidic darshan maanate the tathaa param purusharth kaa saadhan maanakar uskaa anusaran karte the
 Based on all these facts, it is expedient to consider Sankhya philosophy as Vedic
 haan, apane parvarti vikaas main yah avashya hi kuch moolbhoot siddhanton main veda viruddh ho gaya he jaise uttarvarti sankhya vaidic parampara ke viruddh nirishwar he, uski prakruti swatantra rup se swat: samast vishwa kii sristi karti he
 But the origin of this philosophy is found in the oldest Chandogya and Vrhadaranyaka Upanishads
 isi se isaki pracheenta suspasht he
 Only two fundamental texts of this philosophy are available today - the first "samkhya-discourse-sutra" with six chapters and the second "samkhikarika" with seventy kariks
 in do ke atirikt ek atyant laghukaay sutaragranth bhi he jo "tatv samaas" ke naam se prasiddh he
 The rest of the Samkhya Vadmaya is only the commentary and epitope of these three
 inamen sankhya sutron ke upadeshta parampara se kapil muni maane jate hai
 Scholars do not consider the Sankhya-discourse-sutras available for many reasons to be Kapilized
 itani baat avashya hi nishchit he ki in sutron ko kapilopdisht maanane par bhi iske anek sthalon ko swayan sutron ke hi ant:-sakshya ke bal par prakshipt maananaa padegaa
 The numerals are composed by Ishvakrishna, whose time is considered by the majority to be the middle of the third century AD
 vastut: inkaa samay isse paryaapt purv kaa prathit hota he
 There is no scripture of Kapuri's disciple, Asuri, but his famous disciple Acharya Panchshikh, in the form of many sutras quoted in ancient texts like Vyasarit Yogabhasya, etc
, it seems clear that any sutra script by him was famous in ancient times
 anek vidwaanon ke mat se yah prasiddh granth shashthitantr hi tha
 By the opinion of Udayveer Shastri, the conspiracy-related Sankhya-discourse-sutra available in the present times was also known as "shashtitantra" due to the representation of shasthi substances
 unke mat se sambhavat: kapil muni ke prashishy panchashikhacharya ne us par vyakhya likhi thi or vah bhi mulgranth ke hi naam par shashthitantr kahi jaati thi
 According to the opinion of some scholars, "shashthi Tantra" is written of the famous numerical annuity
 jaigishadhya, deval, asit ityadi anya anek pracheen sankhyacharyon ke vishay main aaj kuch vishesh gyaan nahin he

 tipu sultan karnataka bharat ke tatkaaleen mysore rajya ke shaasha the
 Tipu Sultan was born on 20 November 1750 in Devanahalli km north of Karnataka)
 unka puraa naam sultan fateh ali khan shahab tha
 His father's name was Hyder Ali and mother's name was Faqrunnisa
 unke pita haidar ali mysore samrajya ke sainapati the jo apni takat se 1761 main mysore samrajya ke shaasha bane
 Tipu is known as the lion of Mysore
 yogya shaasha ke alaava tipu ek vidwaan, kushanhogay sainapati or kavi bhi the
 Tipu Sultan presented gifts to Hindu temples
 malkot ke mandir main sone or chaandi ke bartan he, jinke shilaalekh bataate hai ki ye tipu ne bhent kiye the
 Had presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikant temple of Kalale
 1782 or 1799 ke bich, tipu sultan ne apni jaagir ke mandiron ko 34 daan ke sanad jari kiye
 Many of these presented silver and gold plate gifts
 nanajangud ke shrikanteshwar mandir main tipu kaa diya hry ek ratna-jadit cap he
 Tipu presented a green Shivling to the Nanjundeshwar temple of Nanjangud
 shrirangpatna ke ranganath mandir ko tipu ne saat chaandi ke cap or ek rajat kapur-jvaalik pesh kiya
 Hyder Ali's demise and Tipu Sultan's reign in the late 18th century is a major event in Mysore
 With the arrival of Tipu Sultan, the British imperialist policy reached a tremendous foundation, on the one hand, the company government was expanding its nascent British Empire
 On the other hand, Tipu, on the other hand, was determined to protect Mysore on the strength of his valor and diplomacy
 Thus, in the late 18th century, Tipu was a great ruler who tried to expel the British from India
 apane pita haidar ali ke pashchaat 1782 main tipu sultan mysore kii gaddi par baitha
 Like his father, he was a highly skilled commander and a clever diplomat
 That is why he always wanted to avenge the defeat of his father from the British, the British were quite afraid of him
 tipu kii akruti main angrejon ko nepolian kii tasviir dikhaai padati thi
 He was a master of many languages, he started taking administrative service and warfare in his father's time, but his greatest demerit was that he was a stubborn and arrogant person
 yahi durgun uske paraajay kaa kaaran bana vah francisiyon par bahut adhik bharosa karata tha or deshi raajaaon ki shaktiyon ko tukshya samajhataa tha vah apane pita ke samaan hi nirankush or svantrtaachari tha lekin phir bhi praja ke takalifon kaa use kaaphi dhyaan rahata tha
 Thus, the peasants were happy during his reign, he was not a religion despite being a staunch Muslim
 He looked at Hindus, Muslims with a single eye, was also a great reformer and tried to improve the direct field of governance
 uske charitra ke sambandh main vidwaanon ne kaaphi matbhed he
 Criticizing him, various British scholars have described him as tyrannical and righteous
 itihaas kaa vilaksh ke anusaar haidar shaayad hi koi galati karata tha or tipu sultan shaayad hi koi kaam karata tha mysore main ek kahawat he ki haidar samrajya sthapit karne ke liye paidaa hua tha
 And Tipu is one of the few scholars who have praised Tipu's character for losing him
 vastut: tipu ek parishramee shaasha moulik sudhaarak or mahaan yoddha tha
 Despite all these things, he was not as diplomatic and visionary as his father, this was his greatest demerit
 isse bhi badi avagun uski paraajay agar uski vijay hoti to uske charitra kii prashansa kii jaati
 From the treaty of Mangalore, the drama of British Mysore war could not end, both sides did not consider this treat to be permanent, in 1786 AD Lord Cornwallis became the Governor General of India, he was not able to interfere in the internal affairs of the Indian states, but that Seeing the situation at the time, he had to intervene because at that time Tipu Sultan was his great enemy, so the British gave their Thiti Tipu this has the agreement with the regime to strengthen the person who wants to set up its head in both South hand for friendship Fransisio
 cornwalis jaanata tha ki tipu ke saath uskaa yuddh anivaary he
 And so he wanted to establish friendship with great powers
 usne nizaam or maraathon ke saath sandhi kar tipu ke khilaaf ek sanyukt morcha kaayam kiya or iske baad usne tipu ke khilaaf yuddh ki ghoshnaa kar di is tarah tritiy misur yuddh prarambh hua yah yuddh do varshon tak chalata rahaa prarambh main angrej asafal rahe lekin ant main isaki vijay hui
 In March 1792 AD, the war with Sri Rangapatya's treaty ended, Tipu gave half of his kingdom and 30 lakhs to the British to the Nizam, the largest part of it between the river Krishna Ta Pand
 kuch hissaa maraathon ko bhi praapt hua jisase uski raj kii seemaa tangabhadra tak chali ai shesh hisson par angrejon kaa adhikaar rahaa tipu sultan ne jaaytan ke rup main apane do pugon ko bhi cornwalis ko supurd kiya is paraajay se tipu sultan ko baari chhati uthaani padi unka rajya company rajya se ghir gaya tathaa samudr se unka sampark tut gaya
 Critics say that Cornwallis was in a hurry to make the treaty and by not having the full residence of Tipu that if he had crushed Tipu's power, there would not have been a fourth Mysore War in the future, but in fact Carnavalis had not done his visionary
 At that time, the English army was sick and there was a possibility of war between England and France in Europe
 The Marathas and the Nizams would have started burning with it if the British had merged the entire state with the British, so the Carnavalis' aim was that the power of Tipu would be exhausted and at the same time the company's friends could not become powerful
 He attempted to crush Tipu's power without making his friends powerful
 tipu sultan is apmaan janak sandhi se kaaphi dukhi the or apni badanaami ke kaaran vah angrejo ko parajeet kar dur karnaa chahta the prakriti ne unhen aisa mauka bhi diya lekin bhagya ne tipu kaa saath nahin diya is samay england or france main yuddh chal rahaa tha is intaraashtra paristhiti se laabh uthaane ke liye tipu ne vibhinn deshon main apana rajdut bheja francisiyon ko usne apane rajya main vibhinn tarah ki suvidhaayen pradaan ki apane sainik sanghathan ke unhone farsisi afasar nyukt kiye or unhone angrejon ke viruddh sahaayta ki april 1798 i
 main kuch francisi tipu ki sahaayta ke liye pahunchaa falat: angrej or tipu ke bich sangharsh aavashyak ho gaya
 At this time Lord Wellesley was appointed Governor General of Bengal
 unhonen tipu ki shakti ko kuchalane kaa nishchay kiya tipu ke viruddh usne nizaam or maraathon ke saath gathbandhan karne ki cheshtaa ki nizaam ko milaane main vah safal hue lekin maraathon ne koi spasht uttar nahin diya 1798 main nizaam ke saath velesli ne sahaayak sandhi ki or yah ghoshnaa kar di jite hue pradeshon main kuch hissaa maraathon ko bhi diya jaay purn taiyaari ke saath velesli ne mysore par akraman kar diya is tarah misur kaa chauthaa yuddh prarambh hua
 Tipu Sultan was a mighty warrior from the beginning
 aakhir tak yuddh karte karte mar gayi mysore par angrejo ki adhikaar ho gaya is prakaar 33 varsh purv misur main jis muslim shakti kaa udai hua tha sirf uskaa ant hi nahin hua balki angrej misur yuddh kaa naatak hi samaapt ho gaya
 Mysore, which had been the enemy of the progress of the British for 33 consecutive years, now came under the control of the British, the British and the Nizam got the partition of Mysore, the British got some part and the Nizam's right was accepted on some of the Marathas too
