 Sanyogita / ˈsəmjoʊɡɪtɑː xɔːhɑːnə / ) was the wife of Prithvirajatriya
 prithviraj ke saath gandharvavivaah kar ke wein prithviraj kii ardhangini bani thi
 Incidentalism is counted among the important events in the history of India
 prithviraj kii teraa rajnion main se sanyogita ati rupavati thi
 Sanyogita was also known by the names Tilottama, Kantimati, Sanjukta, etc
 unke pita kannauj ke raja jayachand the
 Who assisted Ghori in the war against Prithviraj
 sanyogita kaa janm kannauj pradesh main hua tha
 His father's name was Jayachand
 prithvirajraso kavy ke sanyogitaswayamvar naam ke vibhaag main ullikhit he ki, sanyogita purv janm main rambha naamak apsara thi
 Due to the curse of a sage, she appeared on the earth in the name of Sanyogita
 sanyogita kaa ullekh vivedh kaavyon main bhinn rup main prapya he
 Such as Prithvirajaraso in poetry, Samyukrita, Prithvirajavijaya epic in Tilottama and Surjancharitmahakaavya in Kantimati prithvirajraso kavy main or surajncharit mahakavy main spashtollekh he ki, sanyogita jayachand kii putree thi
 The great part of Prithvirajvijay's epic is Kshatiyukta
 parantu vahaan bhi ganga nadi ke tat par viksit kisi gram main sanyogita kaa janm hua tha ye ullekha prapya he
 Historians believe that Kannauj was definitely that city
 sanyogita jab yauvan ko praapt hui, us samay sampoorn bharat main prithviraj kii veerta kii charchaayen ho rahi thi
 When Sanyogita heard the story of Prithviraj's valor, she got tied up in Prithviraj's love loop
 premshastra main asi kanyaon ko mugdha kaha gaya he
 When Jaichand came to know about the heartfelt love of Mugdha Sanyogita, he set out to marry his daughter with another king
 kyonki jayachand or prithviraj ke madhya sambandh vaimnasypurna the
 After that Jayachand conducted Ashwamedhayagya
 us yajna ke ant main sanyogita ke swayamvar kii bhi ghoshnaa kar di
 On the occasion of Swayamvar, he invited all the kings of the whole of India but did not invite Prithviraj
 prithviraj kii is prakaar apmaan karne par bhi jayachand santusht nahin hua
 Therefore, he made an idol of Prithviraj with iron and installed it in place of the gatekeeper
 parantu swayamvar ke samay sanyogita ne prithviraj kii murti ko hi varmala pahanaai
 When Sanyogita at the gate was wearing the statue of Prithviraj at the same time, Prithviraj entered the kingdom
 prithviraj ne sanyogita ko ashv ke upar bithaaya or dehali chale gayi
 Once, King Prithviraj was in the garden of Ajmeru's palace, at the same time Pratihari was present there
 pratihaari ne raja ko kaha, "he rajan ! kanyakubj se ai ek mahila aap se milanaa chaahati hai"
 After this, Pratihari presented the woman in front of the king after getting the king's signal
 raja ko pranaam kar mahila boli, "he rajan ! kanyakubj ke swami jayachand kii sanyogita namika kanya he
 How can i describe her beauty? Brahma has composed Kamadeva as the siddhi from the essence of all the verses
 sanyogita ke rachana ke samay brahm dwaara jo vastuen ekatrit kii gai, un vastuon se hi amrit, chandramaa, kumud or camel rachana hui"
 Pausing a little, the woman further said, "O Hindusharestha! If Kamadeva chants in an Amritasamudra, then Lakshmi: i can hardly compare the beauty of coincidence with those beautiful Lakshmi"
 ek baar apane pita ke saath rajmahal main sthit sanyogita ne aksmaat hi chaarnon dwaara gaaya hua aapkaa gunpratipadak geet suna
 When you defeated Mlechraja in the war, only then was there a feeling of affection towards you
 sanyogita kaa swarnakmal pushp jaise dedeepyaman mukh aapke virah se moorchhit camel pushpawat ho gaya
 Janou Kafoni, Kapokalan in Karakamal, looking at the nose and setting you in mind, she is spending the day
 ek din ratri ke tritiy prahar main swapn main sanyogita ne kaamdeorupi aap ke darshan kiye
 His antagonism has crossed the limits
 he rajan ! aaj vidhaataa bhi us par kashton kii varsha kar rahaa he
 Sanyogita's father is keen to get Sanyogita married with Anuraja by becoming his enemy
 pita kii ichha ko sun kar duhkhaveg se roti hui rajkumaari sanyogita ne apni sakhi ko kaha, "aho ! pruthivi par sthit ho kar chandramaa ko praapt karne kii ipsa morrkhtaa hi he
 The man i do not know, the man's actions are funny and funny
 vishesh ye he ki vah purush mahan samrat he
 The marriage proposal made by Kanya creates an irony
 atah he sakhi ! mere dushprapya manorath par aashaa ke ankur kii kalpana bhi nahin he" aisa bol kar sanyogita moorchhit ho gai
 After that, conscious effort, she said, "you go to Shakambhari
" meri hridayasthiti ko samrat ke sammukh upasthaapit karo
 If they don't come for my salvation, then i will drown in the Ganges "
 paricharika kaa nivedan sun kar samrat ne pratyuttar diya ki, "us mriganayani kaa manorath purna hua hi samajho
 Tell him that i will soon come to Kanyakubj to protect him "
 uske pashchaat paricharika kaa yogya aatithy karke use waapas bhej diya
 Immediately he himself walked towards Kanyakubj with his nobles
 prithviraj ne jab kanyakubj pravesh kiya, tab vah chhadmaveshi the
 Because he wanted to see every genre of Kanyakubja
 atah prithviraj chaaran ke vesh main nagar main yahan vahaan bhraman karne lage
 Prithviraj saw the gates of the city of Kanyakubja, the palace, the huge buildings, the quadrangle and the gardens
 evam kanyakubj nagar main bhraman karte hue unhone nagar ke vishay main suchnaayen ekatra kar lee
 According to the Surajncharit epic, Prithviraj went to Indrapastha, taking the coincidence in the night
 anya granthon main sanyogitaaharan kaa jo ullekh miltaa he, us se yah kinchit bhinn ullekh surjancharit mahakavy main praapt hota he
 Some scholars are of the opinion that, "there is no mention of coincidence anywhere in Jayachand's inscriptions
" evam uske astitv ke bhi koi pramaan na hone se vah ek kaalpanik paatr maani jaati hai"
 Among scholars who question the subject of being a historical character of Sanyogita, Dr
 Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha is counted
 dow ojha kaa mat he ki, jayachand ke shilalekhon main yaa tamrapatron main kahin bhi sanyogita kaa varnan nahin he or rambhamanjarimahakavy main or hammirmahakavy main sanyogita kaa ullekh praapt nahin hota he
 Therefore, it was the imagination of any bhat of the sixteenth century which is a character of coincidence
 anya itihasvidon kaa kathan he ki, rambhamanjarimahakavy main or hammirmahakavy main sanyogita kaa varnan nahin he ojha-mahoday ne kaha
 But there is no mention of Prithviraj's marriages in those texts
 jisase prithviraj ke vivaah nahin hue the ye kah nahin sakate

 Samiens were formerly called 'lap' or 'laplander' in Europe, but the Sami now considers it a slang because it means 'rags'
 is shabd kaa taatpary yah tha ki sami garib or fatehaal hai
 The Sami people have been living in their homeland for the last 5,000 years, although 10,000-year-old remains have been found in their area, some of which have similar depictions that Sami still traditionally uses today
 
 They are considered the most northerly natives of Europe

 During the last ice age, the ancestors of the Samians settled on the west coast of Norway and as the Himalayans withdrew from the rising heat, it spread eastward into northern Scandinavia
 europe main yah ek vivaad kaa vishay rahaa he ki sami pehle apane aadhunik kshetra se kitna dakshin tak vistrut the
 The answer to this question was also based on the decision of the Samians to have authority over their lands
 pehle to yah samajha jaataa rahaa ki ve madhya scandinavia se uttar main hi rahete the lekin aadhunik khoj se dakshini norge ke kuch bhaagon main bhi madhyakaalin sami avshesh mili hai
 By the 18th century, the Sami people lived to a large extent independent from Norway, but in the 19th century, in an effort to organize their nation, Norway pressured the Samians to abandon their culture and adopt Norwegian culture and language
 uttari norge kaa vikaas kiya gaya or us se bhi samiyon main apni samskruti ke liye hin bhaavana utpann hui

 1986 main samiyon ne apana ek raashtragan or dhvaj banaaya
 In 2005 the Parliament of Norway passed the 'finnmark Bill' under which the Sami Parliament and the Finnmark Provincial Council were entrusted with the administration of the areas of the Finnmark District which had previously been controlled by the Government of Norway

 His first military campaign was against the Saka satraps of Saurashtra
 sangharsh prakriya evam anya sambhddha vishyon kaa vistrut gyaan uplabdh nahin hota
 It is clear from Chandragupta's Udayagiri cavalry of the Sandhivagrihaka Veerasena Shaab, that he intended to reach the whole earth
