 Economics is also used to understand how the economy works and how the economic relationship of different sections in the society is
 arthshaastreey vivechna kaa prayog samaaj se sambandhit vibhinn kshetron main kiya jaataa he, jaise:- aparaadh, shiksha, parivaar, swasthya, kanoon, raajnneeti, dharm, saamaajik santhaan or yuddh ityadi
 Pro
 According to Samuelsson, british arthshaastri alfred marshall ne is vishay ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘manushya jati ke rosemara ke jivan kaa adhyayan’ bataaya he
 Marshall had found that whatever is happening in society, economic powers are behind it
 isiilie saamaj ko samajhane or ise behatar banane ke liye hamen iske arthik aadhaar ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 According to Lionel Robinson the definition of modern economics is as follows- durlabhta kaa arth he ki uplabdh sansaadhan sabhi maangon or zaruraton ko puraa karne main asamarth hai
 Economics is of relevance due to rarity and alternative uses of resources
 atev yah vishay prerakon or sansadhano ke prabhaav main vikalp kaa adhyayan karata he
 In economics, it is natural for economic matters to be predominant
 parantu hamako yah na bhul janaa chahie ki gyaan kaa uddeshy arth praapt karnaa hi nahin he, satya kii khoj dwaara vishwa ke liye kalyaan, sukh or shanti praapt karnaa bhi he
 Economics also tells how happiness and peace can be achieved in the world by the economic efforts of humans
 sab shastron ke samaan arthshaastra kaa uddeshy bhi vishwakalyaan he
 The view of economics is international, although it also takes into account personal and national interests
 yah sambhav he ki is shaastra kaa adhyayan kar kuch vyakti yaa raashtra dhanwaan ho jaaen or adhik dhanwaan hone kii chintaa main duusare vyakti yaa rashtron kaa shoshan karne lagen, jisase vishwa kii shanti bhang ho jaae
 But all these works related to their exploitation cannot be said to be appropriate or appropriate to economics, because economics can only support those works by which the growth of world welfare can be done
 is vivechan se spasht he ki arthshaastra kii saral paribhaasha is prakaar honi chahie-arthshaastra main munshyon ke arthsambandhi sab kaaryo kaa krambaddh adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 His mission is world welfare and his vision is international
 jisamen dhan sambandhit kriyaaon kaa aadhyayan kiya jaataa he, arthshaastra kehalaata he
 The content of economics is indicated by its definition
 arrathshaatra vah vigyaan he jo maanav ke swabhaavik vaikalpik upyog karne vaale sadhano ore unke prayog ke madhya sambandh kaa adhyayan karaata hai
 Economics has theoretical and practical importance
 arthshaastra par likhi gayi pratham pustak kautilya rachit arthshaastra he
 Economics is a very ancient discipline
 chaar upved ati pracheen kaal main banaae gaye the
 The Earth Veda is also considered to be a Upveda in these four Upvedas, but it is no longer available
 vishnupurana main bharat kii pracheen tathaa pradhan 18 vidyaon main arthshaastra bhi pariganit he
 Presumptive and Cautical economics are available at this time
 arthshaastra ke sarvapratham acharya brihaspati the
 His economics is obtained in the form of formulas, but it does not include everything related to economics
 kautilya kaa arthshaastra hi ek aisa granth he jo arthshaastra ke vishay par uplabdh krambaddh granth he, isliye iskaa mahatv sabase adhik he
 Acharya Kautilya is also famous by the name of Chanakya
 ye chandragupta maury ke mahaamantri the
 His book 'arthashastra' is often 2,300 years old in the opinion of the pundits
 acharya kautilya ke matanusaar arthshaastra kaa kshetra prithvi ko praapt karne or uski raksha karne ke upayon kaa vichaar karnaa he
 He has included many things in his economics from initiation of celibacy to conquering countries
 shaharon kaa basaanaa, guptcharon kaa prabandh, sena kii rachana, nyaayalayon kii sthapana, vivaah sambandhi niyam, daybhag, shutraon par chadhaai ke tareeke, kilabandi, sandhiyon ke bhed, vyuharachna ityadi baton kaa vistaarrup se vichaar acharya kautilya apane granth main karte hai
 Authentically, how many things in this book are outside the specified area in the modern period of economics
 usamen raajnneeti, dandniti, samajashaastra, nitishastra ityadi vishyon par bhi vichaar hua he
 The meaning of the four efforts in Indian culture is also included
 jain dharm main aparigrah kaa upadesh kiya gaya he

 He was followed by Malthus, Ricardo, Mill, Jevons, Kaal Marx, Sizvik, Marshall, Walker, Taussig and Rabins, who wrote beautiful works on economics
 parantu arthshaastra ko ek nishchit rup dene kaa shrey profesar marshall ko praapt he, yadhyapi profesar robins kaa profesar marshall se arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main matbhed he
 Three parties certainly appear in Western economists regarding the field of economics
 pehla dal professor robins kaa he jo arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan maanakar yah sweekaar nahin karata ki arthshaastra main aisi baton par vichaar kiya jaae jinke dwaara aarthik sudhaaron ke liye maargdarshan ho
 The second team is of Professor Marshall, Professor Pigu, etc
, who accepts economics as a science, recognizes that the main subject of the study of economics is man and considered all the things which are needed for his economic growth
 It is necessary to go
 parantu is dal ke arthshaastri rajiniti se arthshaastra ko alag rakhana chaahate hai
 The third party belongs to socialists similar to Karl Marx, who considers man's labor as the only means of production and seeks the advancement of laborers by destroying capitalists and landlords
 vah mazdooron kaa raaj bhi chahta he
 There is a lot of difference in the three parties regarding the field of economics
 isliye is prashn par vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he: After World War II, Cold War broke out in USA and Soviet Union
 yah koi yuddh nahin tha parantu isse vishwa do bhaagon main bant gaya
 America, England, Germany, Australia, France, Canada, Spain were side by side during the Cold War
 ye sabhi desh loktantric the or yahan par khuli arthvyavastha kii niti ko apanaaya gaya
 People were open to trade
 share bazaar main paisa lagane kii chhot thi
 Many big companies were formed in these countries
 in companiyon main naye-naye anusandhan hue
 Universities, information technology, engineering industry, banks, etc
 have all grown rapidly
 ye sabhi desh duusare deshon se vyapaar ko badhaava dene kii niti ko sweekaarte the
 All these countries have progressed well since 1945
 duusari taraf rus, china, myanmar, purvi germany sahit kai or desh the jahaan par samaajwaad kii arth niti apanaayi gayi
 Most of the industries here had strict government control
 udyogon se hone vaale laabh par sarkaar kaa adhikaar rahata tha
 Generally these countries did very little trade with other democratic countries
 is tarah kii arth niti ke kaaran yahaan ke udyogon main adhik pratispardhaa nahin hoti thi
 Even ordinary people had no incentive to make profit
 in karanon se in deshon main aarthik vikaas bahut kam hua
 On 3 October-1990, East Germany and West Germany merged
 sanyukt germany ne pragatishilath pashchimi germany kii tarah khuli arthvyavastha or loktantr ko apanaaya
 This was followed by the fragmentation of Soviet Russia in 1991 and the birth of 15 countries including Russia
 rus ne bhi samaajwaad ko chhodkar khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 China did not abandon socialism completely, but adopted liberal policies from the late 1970s and made great progress in the next 3 years
 checkoslovakia bhi samaajawaadee desh tha
 It fragmented into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1-january-1993
 in deshon ne bhi samaajwaad chhod ke loktantr or khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 The concept of value is central in economics
 isko maapne kaa ek tarika vastu kaa bazaar bhav he
 Adam Smith defined labor as the main source of value
 "mulya ke shram siddhanth" ko karl marks sahit kai arthshaastriyon ne pratipaadit kiya he
 According to this theory, the value of a service or commodity is equal to the labor used in its production
 adhikansh logon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mulya vastu ke daam nirdhaarit karata he
 This labor theory of price is closely linked to the "production cost theory of value"
 maang aapurti kii sahaayta se purnatah pratispardhi bazaar main beche gayi vastuon keemat or maatra kii vivechna, vyakhya or purvanumaan lagaaya jaataa he
 It is one of the most fundamental forms of economics
 kramash: bade siddhanton or praroopon ke vikaas ke liye iskaa vishad rup se prayog hota he
 Demand is the quantity of a product in a fixed period that a consumer wants to buy at a fixed price and is able to buy
 maang ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or icchit maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 Supply is the quantity of goods that a producer or seller is ready to sell in the market at a given price in a given time
 aapurti ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or aapurti kii maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 According to Prof
 Rabins, economics is the science that studies the functions of human beings which are present as the intended object and its finite means, which are used in alternative or at least two ways
 arthshaastra kii is paribhaasha se nimnlikhit baaten spasht hoti hai- Man experiences happiness from the fulfillment of his desires
 isliye prayek manushya apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karnaa chahta he
 The means, liquids, etc
 he possesses for the fulfillment of desires are finite
 vyakti kitna bhi dhanwaan kyon na ho, uske dhan kii maatra avashya parimit rahati he; phir vah is parimit saadhan dravya kaa upyog kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, according to the appropriate definition, economics considers all the functions of human beings, which he does by finite means to satisfy his desires
 is prakaar uske upbhog sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Similarly, how the means of purchasing many items in the market of a human being is limited
 is parimit saadhan dwaara vah apni aavashyak vastuen kis prakaar kharidta he, vah koun si vastu kis dar se, kis pariman main, kharidta yaa bechata he, arthath vah vinium kis prakaar karata he, in sab baton kaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya jaataa he
 When man prepares an object, the means of preparing it remain finite and he can use those means in many ways
 isliye utpati sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona swaabhaavik he
 Man has many desires to use his time
 parantu samay hameshaa parimit rahata he or uskaa upyog kai tarah se kiya ja saktaa he
 Suppose a person is sleeping, worshiping or playing a game
 profesar robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar in kaaryon kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona chahie, kyonki jo samay sone main puja main yaa khel main lagaaya gaya he, vah anya kisi kaary main lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 In any work a human being does, there is a need for time, and the use of this finite means of time must be considered in economics
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha itani vyapak he ki iske anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa vivechan, chaahe vah dharmik, raajnneetik yaa saamaajik hi kyon na ho, arthshaastra ke andar aa jaataa he
 By accepting this definition, the explanation of the limitations of economics, politics, theology and sociology is not equal
 professor robins ke anuyaayiyon kaa mat he ki parimit sadhano ke anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa aarthik pahalu rahata he or isi pahalu par arthshaastra main vichaar kiya jaataa he
 They say, if a work is related to the state, then its aspect should be considered in political science and if that work is also related to religion, then that aspect should be considered in theology
 maan len, ek manushya chorbazar main ek vastu ko bahut adhik mulya main bech rahaa he
 Due to finite resources, the work that he is doing and what effect it has on the production or fulfillment of the object, will be considered in economics; What is the duty of the state in relation to the perpetrator will be considered in political science or politics
 yah kaary acha he yaa bura, iskaa vichaar samajashaastra, achaarshastra yaa dharamshastra main hoga
 And, the idea of how to prevent this may not be in any scripture
 kisi bhi kaary kaa keval ek hi pahalu se vichaar karnaa uske uchit adhyayan ke liye kahan tak uchit he, yah vichaarneey he
 The second note to Professor Robbins's definition of economics is that he considers economics only as science
 usamen keval aise niyamon kaa vivechan rahata he jo kisi samay main kaary kaaran kaa sambandh batalaate hai
 These serious questions cannot be considered in what kind of changes should happen in the circumstances and what are the ways of changing the circumstances, because all these works are outside the science
 maane len, kisi samay kisi desh main sharaab pinevaale vyaktiyon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 According to Professor Robbins's definition, the only consideration in economics will be how the increase in the number of drinkers will affect the price of alcohol, the drinkers and alcoholics themselves
 parantu unke arthshaastra main is prashn par vichaar karne ke liye gunjaaish nahin he ki sharaab pinaa acha he yaa bura or sharaab pine kii aadat sarkaar dwaara kaise band kii ja sakati he
 He lacks guidance in economics
 prayek shaastra main maargdarshan uskaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag mana jaataa he or isi bhaag kaa professor robins ke arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main abhaav he
 Due to this deficiency, the study of economics cannot be beneficial to the public
 samaajawaadee chaahate hai ki poonjipatiyon or jameendaaron kaa astitv na rahane paae, sarkaar mazdooron kii ho or desh kii aarthik dasha par sarkaar kaa purna niyantran ho
 They also consider these questions in their economics books about how a labor government should be established
 jameendaaron or poonjipatiyon kaa astitv kaise mitaayaa jaae
 What kind of organization of labor government and how their organization can be done world wide
 is prakaar samaajawaadee lekhak arthshaastra kaa kshetra itnaa vyapak bana dete hai ki usamen raajnneetishastra kii bahut si baaten aa jaati hai
 We should define the field of economics in such a way that it does not include the things of political science or any other scripture
 arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main professor marshall kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha par bhi vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he
 According to Professor Marshall, economics studies the ordinary work related to human life
 vah manushyon ke aise vyaktigat or samjik kaaryon kii jaanch karata he jinka ghanishtha sambandh unke kalyaan ke nimit bhautik saadhan praapt karne or unka upyog karne se rahata he
 Professor Marshall has increased the field of economics by placing the welfare of the municipality in the definition of economics
 parantu is arthshaastri ne bhi arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main apni pustak main kuch vichaar nahin kiya
 In the present day Western economists have increased the field of economics, but even today, they do not accept the idea of economics in the field of economics
 ab to arthshaastra ko kala kaa rup diya ja rahaa he
 Economic plans are discussed everywhere in the world
 aarthik yojana taiyaar karnaa ek kala he
 No plan can be prepared without a goal
 arthshaastra ko koi bhi sarvasafal nishchit dhyey na hone ke kaaran in yojana taiyaar karanevaalon kaa bhi koi ek dhyey nahin he
 Each scheme assumes a different goal
 arthshaastra main ab deshavaasiyon kii dasha sudhaarney ke tareekon par bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he, parantu is dasha sudhaarney kaa antim lakshya abhi tak nishchit nahin ho paaya he
 In the absence of a well-known goal, there has been so much difference among economists that one opinion of two economists on a subject is difficult
 is matbhinnata ke kaaran arthshaastra ke adhyayan main ek badi baadha upasthit ho gai he
 To overcome this hurdle, Western economists should think seriously about the objective of economics in their texts and should, as far as possible, make a well-known goal of economics early
 sansar main prayek vyakti adhik se adhik sukhi hona or du:kha se bachanaa chahta he
 He knows that happiness is attained when his desire is satisfied and when the desire is not fulfilled, then he experiences sorrow
 dhan dwaara icchit vastu praapt karne main sahaayta milti he
 Therefore, every person tries to get wealth
 vah samajhataa he ki sansar main dhan dwaara hi sukh kii prapti hoti he
 To get maximum happiness, he tries to get more and more wealth
 is dhan ko praapt karne kii chintaa main vah praaia: yah vichaar nahin karata ki dhan kis prakaar se praapt ho rahaa he
 The result of this is that money is also obtained by means of which others are exploited, others are hurt
 is prakaar dhan praapt karne ke anek udhaaharan die ja sakate hai
 The capitalist does not give fair wages to his laborers in the worry of getting more money
 isse mazdooron kii dasha bigadane lagati he
 The shopkeeper destroys the health of his customers by adulterating foods
 chorbazari dwaara anek saral vyakti thage jate hai, mahajan karjadaaron se atyadhik sood lekar or jameendaar kisaanon se atyadhik lagaan lekar asankhya vyaktya ke pariwaron ko barabaad kar dete hai
 It is the unwavering law of nature that what one sows has to be reaped
 dusron kaa shoshan kar yaa du:kha pahunchaakar dhan praapt karanevaale is niyam ko shaayad bhul jate hai
 The wealth that you get by hurting others, you only get sorrow in the end
 usase sukh kii aashaa karnaa vyarth he
 It is true that the desired things can be obtained from the wealth which is obtained by hurting others and by obtaining these things one can get happiness
 parantu yah sukh asthaayee he or ant main dukh kaa kaaran ho jaataa he
 There are many such things in the world, which brings immediate happiness by using it, but in the long run, they get sadness
 udaahranarth maadak vastuon ke seven se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, paratu jab unki aadat pad jaati he tab unka seven atyadhik maatra main hone lagata he, jiskaa swasthya par bura prabhaav padataa he
 This causes sadness in the end
 dusron ko haani pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt hota he vah nishchit rup se buree aadaton ko badhaata he or kuch samay tak asthaayee sukh dekar vah du:kha badhaane kaa saadhan ban jaataa he
 Money obtained by giving grief to others can never be a seeker of lasting happiness and peace
 sukh do prakaar ke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by hurting others
 inke udhaaharan upar die ja chuke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by making others happy
 ve manushya ke man main shanti utpann karte hai
 The happiness that comes from performing one's duty also gives peace, the labor that one has to do while performing duty, definitely brings some pain, but on completion of the work, that sorrow results in happiness and from that Peace arises in is prakaar kaa sukh bhavishya main du:kha kaa saadhan nahin hota ore is prakaar ke sukh ko anand kehete hai
 When pleasure is attained, then there is no more than just a trace of sorrow
 aisi dasha ko paramanand kehete hai
 Achieving ecstasy is the best goal of every person
 vahi aatmakalyaan kii charam seemaa he
 It is the welfare of every human being in this that he always tries to achieve ecstasy
 vah hameshaa aisa sukh praapt karata rahe jo bhavishya main du:kha kaa kaaran yaa saadhan na ban jaae or vah shanti or santosh kaa anubhav karne lage
 When we bring happiness to others through our efforts and become the means of their welfare, then according to the adamant law of nature, our welfare also starts to increase by these efforts
 aatmakalyaan praapt karne kaa saral upaay dusron ke kalyaan kaa saadhan bananaa he
 Similarly, not to hurt anyone through your actions is the simplest way to avoid your misery
 prayek vyakti ko yah acchhee tarah samaj lenaa chahie ki uskaa sachcha hitsaadhan dusron ke hitsaadhan yaa parmarth dwaara hi siddh ho saktaa he
 It is clear from this that the happiness of others ie Vishwakalyan is the only means of their lasting happiness and peace ie autobiography
 jab prayek vyakti apana kalyaan karne ke liye dusron ke kalyaan kaa hameshaa praytn karne lagegaa tab kisi bhi tarah se swaartho kaa virodh na hoga, sansar main sab prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho jayega or sarvatra sukh or shanti sthaayee rup se sthapit ho jaaegi
 It is necessary for autism that each person gives as much importance to the selfishness of others as he gives to his selfishness
 jaise vah apane sukhon ko badhaane kaa praytn karata he, vaise hi use dusron ke sukhon ko badhaane kaa bhi praytn karnaa chahie
 The result of this will be that such works will be stopped due to which the suffering of others increases
 isse vishwa ke jeevon main sukh kii nirantar vruddhi hone lagegi or vishwa kaa kalyaan badhate badhate charam seemaa tak pahunch jayega
 Without Vishwakalyan, no person can be autistic
 sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt ho saktaa he
 Autism is the best goal of every person and when economics studies the economic efforts of man, then his aim should also be autism
 parantu, jaisaa upar batalaaya ja chukaa he, sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the aim of economics should be world welfare
 ham yah pehle hi bataa chuke hai ki jab kisi ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Therefore, if there is no desire for anything, then there is no opportunity to get sorrow
 kuch sajjanon kaa mat he ki sampurna ichchhaaon kii nivruti dwaara du:kha kaa abhaav or sthaayee sukh tathaa shanti praapt ho sakati he
 Therefore, if seen from this point of view, then lack of all desires should be the aim of economics
 yah thik he ki abhyaas dwaara ichchhaaon kaa niyantran avashya kiya ja saktaa he, parantu aisi dasha praapt kar lenaa jab kisi bhi prakaar kii ichha utpann hi na hone paae, saadhaaran manushya main se ek ke liye bhi vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Astu, the goal of economics is to accept the lack of complete desires for the welfare of only a few people and the public will not benefit anything from it, so it will not be appropriate to accept this goal
 kuch vyakti maanavkalyaan hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey maanate hai
 They do not consider it necessary to take care of the interests of animals and animals
 ve shaayad yah maanate hai ki jeevajantuon or pashu pakshiyon ko ishwar ne manushya ke sukh ke liye hi utpann kiya he
 Therefore, if the desires of human beings can be fulfilled by hurting or killing them, then there should be no objection in making them sad
 kintu dharamshastra or mahatma gandhi kaa to yah mat he ki prayek vyakti ko aisa hi kaary karnaa chahie jisase 'saarvbhaum hit' arthath sab jeevadhariyon kaa hit ho, kisi kii bhi haani na hone paae
 When a person starts treating the interest of every living being as his own, only then he gets permanent happiness and peace
 mahatma gandhi ne is maarg ko 'sarvoday' naam diya he
 It is only through this Sarvodaya Path that every type of conflict in the world can be overcome, exploitation can end and world peace can be established
 sarvoday kaa maarg prayek vyakti kaa kalyaan ore vishwakalyaan kii vruddhi karne kaa uttam saadhan he
 Therefore, according to him, the aim of economics should not be to consider human welfare but only to believe in world welfare
 arthshaastra kii vishay saamagree ke sambandh main aarthik kriyaaon kaa varnan bhi jaruri he
 Earlier, production, consumption, exchange and distribution were considered as the four major parts of economics
 aadhunik arthshaastra main in kriyaaon ko paanch bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he
 On the basis of the purpose of economic activities, in 1933, Regner Frisch first divided economics into two parts
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, videshi vinium, banking aadi samshti arthshaastra ke rup hai
 In short, from the point of view of study, we can put different parts of economics in this way: yah vaiyaktik ikaayiyon kaa adhyayan karata he, jaise vyakti, parivaar, form, udyog, vishesh vastu kaa mulya
 According to Bolding, microeconomics is the study of special firms, special families, individual prices, workers, incomes, individual industries, and specialty goods
 yah seemaant vishleshan ko mahatv detaa he
 Many important topics of modern economic theory such as international trade, foreign exchange, revenue, banking, business cycle, national income and employment theory, economic planning and economic development etc
 are studied under it
 boldig ke shabdon main, samshti arthshaastra, arthshaastra kaa vah bhaag he jo arthshaastra ke bade samoohon or ausaton kaa adhyayan karata he, na ki uski vishesh madon kaa
 He tries to define these groups in a useful way and examines their mutual relations
 sankshep main ye hi arthshaastra ke ang he
 Modern economists after Cannes now discuss various parts of economics by some new names, such as economics of capital, capital formation, labor economics, economics of traffic, monetary economics, canyon economics, economics of underdeveloped countries, economics of development , Comparative economics, international economics etc
 aadhunaki kaal main desh videsh main arthshaastra vishay kii snatakottar shiksha bhi inhen naamon ke prashnpatron ke anusaar di jaati he
 Economic system) is a system under which people earn their livelihood by working in various occupations
 aarthik kriyaaon ko sucharu rup se sanchalit karne ke liye prayek desh alag-alag aarthik pranali apanaataa hai
 Economic systems are mainly divided into three parts
 aadhunik arthik praniliyon main samaajwaad tathaa poonjeevaad kaa sarvaadhik ullekh ho rahaa he
 Every country, whether it works under any economic system, has to face various economic problems like poverty, inequality of wealth and income, unemployment, inflation and recession
 in samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye vah vibhinn nitiyon ko apanaataa he
 The main economic policies are as follows
 bharat kii arthshaastra ko jaanane, samajhane or prayog main laane kii apni vishesh panrapara rahi he
 It is a matter of sorrow that the major works of ancient and new Indian economists have not yet been properly evaluated and our students have been studying only Western economists and their theories
 pracheen kaal ke aarthik vichaaron ko ham vedon, upanishdon, mahakavyon, dharamshastron, grihmasutron, naarad, shukr, vidura ke nitigranthon or sarvaadhik rup se kautilya ke arthshaastra se praapt karte hai
 Among the main Indian economists in modern India - mahatma gandhi dwaara pranit tathaa acharya vinoba bhaave dwaara prayog main laai gai arthshaastra kii yah vichaardhaara ati aadhunik he or bharatiyon kii vishisht dein he
 Under this, there are ideas like Gramswarajya, Swavalamban, use of coexistence and non-violent revolution, which, in Jayaprakash Narayan's words, can bring economic revolution anytime anywhere in the world, not only in India
 inkaa prayog nai shiksha ke saath saath bharat main ho rahaa he
 Modern economics is tied up in more than half of mathematical models, practices, equations and formulas
 purv main sankhyikee kaa prayog arthshaastri aichhik rup se karte the parantu ab vah arthshaastra ke hetu anivaary ho gaya he
 Apart from this, econometrics is also being developed in full in development
 pravagic rup main 'in-put out-put vishleshan' se lekar arthshaastra ne 'game theory' tathaa 'technical flo' tak nikaal daalaa he
 All economists are using mathematical tools to clarify economic principles
 lenior programing' tathaa 'vibhedikikaran prakriya' ke antargat arthshaastri ganitiya drishy prabhaavon ke saath-saath adrishy aarthik prabhaavon ko bhi dikhaane kaa praytn kar rahe hai
 From the small machine of calculation to the largest computer, economists have practical forms of mathematical progress
 sambhavat: agle do teen dashak tak aisi vidhiyaan avishkrut ho jaayengi jinase ganitiya vidhiyon dwaara ati sankshep main keval nishkarsh praapt honge tathaa prakriya kaa koi bhi talmail baithaana aavashyak na hoga
 Nowadays economists are relying most on mathematical economics method

 The Asian drama by Gunar Cridal is perhaps the largest economical treatise published after Marx's slave capital, which solved the problems of underdeveloped countries

 Under this, current international problems such as planning, capital formation and foreign aid are studied
 arthshaastra kaa mahatv badi teevr gati se badhata ja rahaa he
 According to the United Nations Affake Report, E
, about 1,000 texts or articles on economics are being published every hour in the world
 raajnneeti ke baad lokapriyata main arthshaastra kaa hi sthaan hai
 In fact, economics has to be used for welfare, otherwise one day it will drown everyone by aiming to raise material resources
 santosh kii baat he ki ab arthshaastri is baat ko samajhane lage hai
 The ancient philosophy of India knows from the beginning that mere multiplicity of material means cannot make a person happy
 pro shumpiter ne apane naveenatam lekh arthshaastra kaa bhavishya main sweekaar kiya he ki siddhant rup se aarthik vishleshan chaahe jitani pragati kar le, vyavhaar main use hameshaa shanti, sukh evam kalyaan ke hetu hi kaary karnaa hoga
 If economics can work for the welfare of all human beings, then its future will be bright
 isi kaaran ab arthshaastra par nobel puraskaar bhi diya jane laga he
 The main limitations of economics are as follows: chlom yaa galgada jaleey jeevon main paaya jane vaala ek shwasan ang he

 Adaptive control is a method of control in which the parameters of the controller are not fixed, but change as the system is to be controlled so that good control can be achieved
 udhaaharan ke liye, udne ke baad vimaan kaa bhaar kramshah kam hota jaataa he 
 Therefore, if an adaptive controller is designed for it, then it will make such changes in itself that the desired control will continue even after the weight of the aircraft is reduced
 anukuli niyantak, robst niyantrak se bhinn he
 The Robust Controller does not change itself, yet at the time of design its parameters are set such that the control remains 'fine' even if the system being controlled changes to a predetermined limit

 Auto-tuning controller or self-tuning controller is a type of adaptive controller

 is shaastra main saadhan, ang or shesh, ye teenon paryaayavachak shabd hai
 Likewise, these three synonyms are Sdhya, Seshi and Angi
 udhaaharan ke liye swargaprapti ke nimitt darsh poornmaas kaa anushthan yadi karnaa ho to usamen darsh or poornmaas angi honge or prayaaj aadi ang honge
 Darsha Yag occurs on Amavasya Tithi and Purnamas Yag occurs on Purnima Tithi
 ) isamen angi pradhan ang kaa prayojak he or ang prayojya he
 In this way, knowing the means of getting the religious ritual requires knowledge of purvaparya as well and in the case of ritualistic agni hotradi karmas for fruits, there is also a discussion of the means of Purvanga and Uttaranga, for which the word "nature" is used
 kintu sauryadi karmke sannidhi main ang kaa paath nahin he
 After the emergence of aspiration at that place, one has to take the organs which are presented in the Darshan Purnamas, which is called as an excess 
 Normally, even if there is a decision, the description of which karma comes in which karma comes, it has been explained by the special instructions
 angon kaa atidesh hone par bhi prakruti main bhed hone ke kaaran praakrit pad ke sthaan par padaantar ko rakhkar paath kiya jaataa he
 For example "agneya tva jushtam nirvapami"
 is shrutivakya main agni pad ke sthaan main "sauryoyeshti" ke suryapad rakhkar "suryaay tvajushta nirvpaami" is shruti ko padhate hai
 Such a sentence is called "ooh"
 in baton ke gyaan bina yah samaj lenaa sambhav nahin he ki kis ang kaa kahan or kaise upyog karnaa chahie jisase anushthan samuchit faldaayak ho sake
 The place where the organ is not read, the organ should be brought from other place, but only those who can do the treatment of deformity can be taken in nature
 jo vikruti main upkaar nahin kar sakate vahaan anya angon kaa adhyaahar nahin hota
 And they do not even have rituals
 aise vachanon ko "baadh" kehete hai
 The decision of which part is obstructed and whose not is subject to "ooh" obstruction
 evam abhipsit faldaata karm ek hi hota he
 But there are many anywhere
 kuch angon kaa anushthan pradhan se purv tathaa kuch kaa pradhan ke pashchaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 For example, Samidheni Prayajadi and a specific follower
 ek hi samay par un angon kaa ek baar athwa anek baar prayog karne ke vishay main kaha gaya he - The name for using once is Tantra and the name for multiple times is "frequency" or "movement"
 kahin kahin angon kaa tantra se anushthan hota he or kahin kahin aavriti se
 Therefore the idea of tantra and movement is also necessary
 kisi fal vishesh ke liye pradhan angi kaa anushthan karte hai or uske angon ko bhi karte hai
 Those organs which require the use of other organs also need to be referred to as context
 isamen pradhan tantri hota he, jise prasang kehete hai
 For example, the Agnostic animal Purodshadi, the perfected person of the aforesaid subjects, can only perform the Sangopang Dharmanasthana, which is explained by Jamini in "mimamsa Darshan"
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samathrya kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, text, place, main and tendency
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 The ninth chapter represents three types of "oohs" with the distinction of mantroh, samoah and samskarah
 dashamadhyay main arthlope, pratyamnaay or pratishedh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke baadh kaa nirupan hai
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus one subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashalini"
 yahan lakshan shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 anek sutron se ek adhikaran banataa he, jisamen ek pradhan sutara tathaa anya gun sutara hote hai
 The principal sutra presupposes the antecedent and the other sutras form the principle
 kahin kahin par do sutron ke dwaara purvottar paksh kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 In such a way, the principle has been formulated by raising the former side without the formula
 kahin kahin siddhant rup se upkram dwaara purv paksh kar siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 There are certain tribunals in a foot
 udaahranarth pratham paad main aath adhikaran hai
 The Tribunal has six substances - subject, doubt, antecedent, principle purpose and consistency
 sangati teen prakaar kii hoti he - shaastra sangati, adhyay sangati or paad sangati
 First Sutra - The name of the first tribunal is the curiosity tribunal
 vichaar shaastra vishay he
 There is doubt as to whether or not the idea is worth starting
 aarambh karne yogya nahin he, yah purv paksh he
 The theory is that thought science should be started
 is vishay kaa mul he kumaril bhatta ke mat main adhyayan vidhi or "prabhakar" mat main adhyaapan vidhi
 On the east side there is the invisible purpose of study and in the theory side, the meaning-knowledge-form is the objective view
 dharm ke vichaar shaastra sambandhi hone ke kaaran is vichaar shaastra main iskaa vivechan sangat he
 In this tribunal, study is parable, this has been proved
 atev vichaar shaastra kaa mul adhyayan vidhi he
 The means of semantics is obscured by the study method
 isiilie vichaar shaastra kaa aarambh vaid he
 Second Sutra - The Second Tribunal has the character and proof of religion, whose duty is reflected in the law
 vah shrey kaa saadhan he
 Here the word Shraya means both physical and spiritual meaning
 gamy dharm main gamak vidhivaakya pramaan hota he
 That which is propounded by prohibition is a means of evil, it is called unrighteousness
 tritiy sutara - tritiy adhikaran main vidhi vaakya hi pramaan he
 Only pledge is done here
 ve do prakaar kahi hai - "chodanaiv lakshann yasya, chodana lakshanmev yasya" arthath yahan pratyaksh aadi pramaan dharm se pramaan nahin hote, kintu vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan mana gaya he
 Fourth Sutra - This Sutra has the fourth tribunal to support the first pledge
 is adhikaran main lok siddh pratyaksh pramaan kaa lakshan - "indriarthsannikarshajanyan gyaanan pratyakshm"
 That is, the direct takes on the present approximate and the religion is originating, so there can be no proof in the direct religion, because the religion is future
 in vachanon se mimasaakaar ne pratyakshopjivi anumaan ushmaan or arthapatti ko bhi pramaan nahin mana he
 Pancham Sutra - The fourth sutra is supported by the fifth curse of the fifth sutra by supporting the first curiosity of the fourth tribunal
 is adhikaran main vidhivaakya hi pramaan he, isi pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 In this context, the authenticity of proofs is automatically generated and accepted automatically
 arthath gyanjanak saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or usee saamagree se pramanya gruhit bhi hota he
 Sentences are of two types - cosmic and Vedic
 loukik vaakya paurushey hone ke kaaran purushgat bhram, pramaad, vipralambh, karnapatav aadi dosha se yukt hota he, atev paurushey vaakya pramaan nahin hota
 The mantra is the Brahminical word Veda Apaurusheya
 at: vidhivaakya main apramanya ke kaaran bhramaadi nahin hone se vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan hai
 To support this second promise, the sign of the proof and the relation of the word is continual
 baadaraayan ne bhi pramanya main parapeksha ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 In substance-rendering, there is a relation between matter by word, in scripture-rendering, and in composition by man
 shabd or arth kaa vachya-vaachak-sambandh nity maanakar veda main purush-pravesh kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 That is, the Vedas are penned by the Purusha - the reason for saying this is that we have never heard, read or known the sentences without the person
 jabaki mimasakon ke mat main shabd tathaa uske dwaara pratipaadya ghatapatadi-arth kaa sambandh nity he
 Therefore, 'this verse explains this meaning' - even if we do not know this verse, the verse itself tells its performance
 arthath shaktigrah na hone par bhi pad main pratipaadansamrthy he hi
 And there is a tendency for the authorization to separate the male relation by the syntactic relation
 is adhikaran main yatha pad kii padaarth main shakti hoti he, vaise hi vaakya kii vaakyarth main shakti hoti he, aise jo pratipaadan karte hai uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, kyonki pad se upasthit padaarth hi aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti se anvit hokar anshatray vishisht bhaavnarup vaakyarth kaa pratipaadan karata he
 The grammaticalization is governed by the syntactic syntax
 is mat ke anusaar shabdabodh main padaarthon kaa paraspar sambandh sansarg maryaada se bhaasata he
 This is the opinion of the Naiyayikas, which connotes the separation of power in the sentence, but Kumaril Bhatt has supported the designation
 prabhakar ne anvitabhidhan kaa samarthan kiya he
 In this way, the male clause in the sentence is repealed in the second way
 tritiy prakaar granth rachana dwaara hota he
 The reference sentence has a relationship with the man in two ways, one by the katru-karma-bhava-relation and the second by the applied-discourse-bhava-relation
 pravachan sarsaadhaaran or rachana asaadhaaran hoti he
 Is an extraordinary adjective
 atev veda paurushey he
 According to some scholars, the Vedas are called Purusparnait or Pourusheya due to the instructions of man, country, river, tree etc
 in the Vedas, but according to Mimamsa philosophy the discourse is also considered extraordinary
 udaahranarth "kathsamhita" athwa "kath brahman" ke vishay main kinvadanti he ki anek shakha adhyayiyon ke madhya "ksht" maharishi ne purna rup se adhyayan kiya tha
 It is for the second that the name of man, river, etc
 comes in the Vedas, this also proves the Veda Pourusheya, but this imagination is not clever-wise-prescribing; Because often the names of worldly things have come from the Vedas, the tradition of folk-names has gone on from that point of view
 arthath veda itihaas ko anitya nahin maanata, kintu itihaas ke nityatv kaa pratipaadan karata he, iskaa vistrut vivechan mimasaa ke "shabarabhashya" main drushtavy he
 The regular subject and sentence or word are seen in the earliest Brahmarsigan Samadhi, so the Vedas do not include the image of the forefathers
 " loukik rachanaayen purush vishesh kartrutv hone ke kaaran paurushey hai, yatha mahabharat, ramayana aadi
 According to Kumaril Bhatt, the study tradition is eternal
 atev veda bhi apaurushey hai
 Such tribunal principle cannot be related to justice only through the creation of Vedas, hence the sentence is the proof in religion
 mimasaa-darshan main aatm-tatv kaa pratipadak koi bhi moulik sutara nahin he
 Although Shankaracharya wrote that "pre-tantra" does not contain self-effulgent formulas, he has described the form of self by saying this utterance, in Uttamimamsa's "an Evatman: Sharire Bhavat"
 vrittikaar mat ko pramaan rup se uddhrut karte hue likhaa he : "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvan tathaa sharirake vakshyam:"
 The idea is that Purvimamsa, like Uttara Mimamsa, is formed by believing the Advaita soul, however, Purvimamsa is practiced only by considering the subject-subservient self-realization in addition to the body, because Karma-siddhanta consists of "gratitude" and "inattention
" or yaheen se punarjanm aadi kii siddhi bhi hoti he
 "chodna Resume:" "satsamprayogay Purushyendriyamam" Atmabija is rendered from both these sutras
 or vapan aadi sanskaar fali kaa sanskaar he
 In Purusharth, the soul gets fruit from the word Yajna and Krit Yag with the word Purush
 shabar swami ne sutara vishesh ke bina hi "yagyaayudh vaakya" ko nimitt maanakar anaatmavaadi ke mat kaa khandan karte hue aatmaswaroop ko tark or shrutiyon ke dwaara siddh kiya he jisase veda pramanya kii bhi siddhi hoti he
 In post-epistemology, the soul is considered one; But in "samkhya Yoga", justice, vahesika, and premeditation, the soul is considered many, which through karma is related to body, sense and mind
 atev sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandha kaha gaya he
 The above triad puts the soul in bondage, so that the soul suffers a pleasant face: Khadi duality
 nity naimitthik karmon ko katrtavya buddhaya karte hue praarabdh karmon ko jeev bhogata rahata he
 Apart from the body sense, the person who worships the soul with the Brahman intellect has no reason for connection with the sense body, etc
 Such a person becomes self-possessed after the destruction of the present body
 uttarmimasaa ke anusaar sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandhan kaha gaya he jo agyaan kaa kaaran he; uski nivritti hi moksh he
 For example - " nivritiratma mohasy gyatatvenoplakshith: The foreshadowing also accepts that the relation of body, senses and subjects is bondage, and its merger is salvation, whose means, knowledge and action are combined
 atmagyaan do prakaar kaa hota he
 Sharatritik is part of the season of enlightenment, which is free from harmony
 vaidic or loukik vaakyon kaa sahasron kii sankhya main vaakyarth nirnyopayogi nyaayon kaa purvamimasaa ne hi pratipaadan kiya he
 Therefore, the first place in Indian philosophies is that of karma exponent of premodern philosophy
 uttarmimasaa agyaan se sristi or atmagyaan se sristi kaa vinaash maanata he
 Justice, Vaiseshika philosophy has called the destruction of the Mahakrishti till Mahakruti and the destruction of the nuclear atom by Mahabhutla in the double order
 arthath sampurna bhav kaary dvanukadi kram se utpann hote hai or sthool se parmaanu paryant jaakar nasht ho jate hai
 The five atoms of earth, water, light and air are continual in the Panch Mahabhutas
 akaash swayan hi nity he, kintu purv mimasaa ke anusaar do prakaar kii sristi or teen prakaar ke pralay hote hai, jinamein mahasrishti or khand sristi shabd se do sristi kahi gai he
 Three dooms have been called in the same way with the words Pralaya, Mahapralaya and Khanda Pralaya
 unamem khand sristi or khand pralay aajkal ke samaan hi mana gaya he
 For example, a particular site gets destroyed due to earthquake etc
 and somewhere new things are created
 mahasrishti main parmaanuon se dvanukadi dwaara panchmahabhoot paryant navagrahadikon kii sristi hoti he, jiskaa ullekh rugveda ke dasham mandal main praapt hota he - In Matsyapuranadi, one also gets a description of the status of the substances present under the block catastrophe, but former epistemology does not accept Mahasruti and Mahapralaya
 uske anusaar sabhi padaarthon ke naash main koi bhi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 As the narrator has said - mimasaa darshan khand sristi or khand pralay ko hi maanata he
 In Indian six-believer philosophies, the seekers of justice, Vaiseshika and Vedanta are often the same
 udaahranarth "yato vaa imani bhutani jaayante", "dyavabhumi janayan dev ek:" "vishwasya katrta bhuvnsy gopta" in shrutiyon ke dwaara or "janmadyasya yat:" is vedant sutara ke dwaara ishwar kii siddhi hoti he
 Similarly, God has also been proved by the "kshitankuradik Kartajranya Karyavat Ghatavat" conjecture in the jurisprudence, but the Vedantis have proved God by the Shrutis as their cooperative reason
 or naiyayikon ne anumaan se ishwar ke siddh kar shrutiyon ko sahakaari kaaran mana he
 There are two views in Sankhya philosophy - Sesvara and Nirishwar
 seshwar sankhyavaadee ishwar ko maanate hai, kintu use purush vishesh shabd se vyavhaar karte hai
 The Niraश्वरvara Samāhākāvī करतेa denies God, "but the science monk has accepted God by referring to the verse" Ishvarasiddhe: "in this sutra as" proof
 mimasaa darshan naiyayikon ke samaan vidhi mukh se ishwar kaa samarthan ar nirishwar sankhyavaadiyon ke samaan nishedh bhi nahin karata, kintu "sambandhakshepaprihaar" granth main kumaril bhatta ne shabdaarth ke sambandh kaa karta ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he
 The idea is that the subject of the relationship is not God
 uparyukt vachanon ko sweekaar kar lokprasiddhi he ki mimasak nirishvaravaadi he
 The commentators like Kumaril Bhatt, Nandishwar etc
 have disposed of the supposed God and accepted the Vedasiddha God
 vastutah mimasaa veda se siddh brahm athwa ishwar ko sweekaar karata hi he
 Because the Mimamsa philosophy considers the Veda to be an automatic proof
 mimasaa kaa purvamimasaa ar veydantka uttarmimasaa naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, the principle of Vedanta's philosophy and the principles of Vedanta are valid, it is clear
 vedavihit yagadi karm dravya or devtaa in do se saadhy hai
 The substance is Dadhyadi and the deity is Shastraka Samadhigamgya
 arthath vidhi vaakya jisko devtaa kahata he use hi devtaa mana jaataa he
 Here three aspects about the deity have been accepted in Dasamadhyay's Chaturthpad and in Shabar Bhashya etc
 texts
 arth devtaa, shabd vishisht arth devtaa or shabd devtaa hai
 The last aspect in all three is the principle, because the meaning is remembered by the word
 atev shabd kii pratham upasthiti hone ke kaaran shabd hi devtaa mana gaya he
 For example, in the words "indraya Swaha, Takkshakaya Swaha", these fourth terms Indraya and Takshkaya are deities
 arth ko devtaa sweekaar karne vaale vyakti bhi shabd kii upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, due to the predominance of the word in all the three sides, the Mimansakas have accepted the word as the deity
 yahan par ek niyam he - vidhi vaakya main jo devatavachak shabd he uskaa aavahan, tyaag or sookt vaakya aadi main uccharan karnaa chahie, na ki uske paryaayavachi shabdon ko
 For example, the word "jatvedas", synonymous with fire, should not be used in "agnayamashtakapalam"
 ukt baton se vidit hota he ki "shabdamayi devtaa" hi mimasaa darshan kaa siddhant he
 The idea of vigrahadi Sadasad bhava of the deity - Vigrahadi five of the deity etc
 are considered in this philosophy
 arthath vigrah, havish, bhoga, aishwarya, prasannataa or faldaatrutiv ye paanch vigrah kahe jate hai
 On the basis of the above promise, Vedantis have considered Vigrahadi five forms of the deity
 abhipraay yah he ki manushya aadi ke samaan hi kar, charan aadi avyav devataaon ke bhi hote hai, ve havish sweekaar karte hai, bhakshan karte hai or prasann hokar yajmaan ko fal dete hai
 Hence the deity is vigrahadimana
 uparyukt vichaar hi yask maharishi ne "nirukt" ke "athaakaar chintanam" vaakya se purushvigrahata ko siddh kiya he
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, "shabdmayi Deity" has been endorsed, but Shabar Swamy has denied the Deity Deity in his best deity authority
 praaia: parthasarathi, khandadev aadi sabhi vidwaanon ne isi maarg kaa avlamban kiya he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne apni tikaa main devtaa ko pradhan na maanakar dravya ke samaan use ang mana he or karm ko hi pradhanthya sweekaar kiya he tathaa kaha he ki karm hi fal detaa he
 No one pleads with the slave while the master is
 karmana phaljanakatvan tathaa shabdamayi devtaa, ukt dway siddhanton kaa samarthan devtaa vigrahadi ko maanakar anya mimasakon ne kiya he
 The deity of the commentary Shabar should be addressed with despotism
 atev purvamimasaa "shabdamayi devtaa" ko hi swikar karata he
 His knowledge, Tadhit, Chaturthi Vibhakti and Mantravan are from these three
 keval inamen paraspar antar yah he ki taddhit shakti kii aavriti se devtaa k bodhan karata he
 Chaturthi explains the Vibhakti symptoms and Mantravarna installations
 mimasaadarshan ne apni karmparakata kii drushti se ukt prakaar se devtaa kaa karm kaa ang mana he
 In fact, the deity is untapped
 nirukt vedang he ar mimasashastra vedapang he
 Therefore, in the context of Vedic deity philosophy, it is necessary to consider the interpretation of the Nirukta as independent and the main deity philosophy
 vaakyon ke dwaara jo bodh hota he use vaakyarth bodh yaa shaabd bodh kehete hai
 The sentence is also a statement - subantachay: vaakyam, tingantayovakyam, suptingntchayo vaakyam
 There are three aspects in it, which should have a causative verb
 amarkosh ke anusaar - "tid
subant chayo vaakyan kriya vaa karkanvita"
 That is, the causative verb of subant and tingant sentences is ejaculatory
 purvamimasaa main kumaril bhatta, prabhakar or murari ke teen mat prasiddh hai, kintu antim main "tripad niti nayan" is naam se khyath granth bhi vidit hua he
 There are two famous departures in the minds of the nominees, Anointedism and Anuvitabhidhanism
 inamen pratham kumaril bhatta or dwitiya prabhakar kaa mat he
 In the Shabdha sense, the sentiment is mainly accepted by Bhatt
 prabhakar ne kaary ko mukhya sweekaar kiya he
 The meaning of the term 'abhidhyataya' means that the substance enlightened by the terms integrates the aspiration, ability and attachment and makes it literal through the signs
 nyaayamat main padon kii padaarth main shakti he or pad gyaan lakshan yaa bodh karte hai
 The positions lead to the presence of matter
 isi prakaar mimasaa main kaha gaya he, udaahranarth jyotishtoman swarg kaamo yajet"
 Here "yajet" has two passages - "yaj" metal and "ta" suffix
 pratyay aakhyaatansh ko lekar aarthi bhaavana kaa pratipaadan karata he
 That feeling has three aspirations - Sādhyākāक्षाa साधa Sādhanākā औरa and "ityākāyātakābakक्षाa"
 saadhyaakanksha hone par swarg kaa saadhyatven anvay hota he
 When there is sadhana, the cause of Dhatworth is unknown
 
 It is an ambivalence that occurs when there is a duty
 vaakyarthaadhikaran main kaha gaya he- The sentence is used in the world to understand the specific meaning
 padashravan se padaarthon kaa pruthak pruthak gyaan hota he
 This is for reading, but the substance that is not intended to the listener and the sentence for which the sentence is used is not the function of the listener, in such a place the meaning of sentence is unacceptable
 atev anupapatti ke nivaranarth lakshana maani gai he
 All philosophers have accepted epigraphy as the seed of symptoms
 padon ke do prakaar ke taatpary maane gaye hai, pratham taatpary tathaa dwitiya mahataatpary
 The first difference refers to the subject matter, and the great phrase implies the subject
 abhihitanvayavaad main vaakya se vaakyarth kaa bodh lakshanya hota he
 Kumaril Bhatt has rendered with the following verses - is vachan se bhatta padka abhihitanvayavaad kaa swaroop digdarshit hota he
 Some scholars state that "ananavitavastha" matter is designated by matter
 unki anvitavastha keval lakshith hoti he
 Thus "anubhitabhidhanism" belongs to Kumaril Bhatt, but what Bhatta's translation translates as Anubhibhidhanism, is not appropriate, because the above article is not discussed anywhere in his texts
 anvitabhidhan shabd kaa yah arth he - pad anvitarth bodhan karte hai
 Therefore, by the power of verse, both the substance and the sentence are realized
 pad shakti se atirikt lakshana aadi maanane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The veteran uses the word to carry an object
 uske paas kaa balak us shabd ko shravan kar ou duusare purush ke le aane or le jane kaa kaary karte dekhakar shabd kaa arth samaj letaa he
 This is the working reason of the trend
 lok main kriya ko bhi kaary samajha jaataa he, usee prakaar veda main bhi yagadi kriya ko prathmat: kaary samajha jaataa he
 Yagadi activity is transient and heaven is eternal in future
 atev ukt veda vaakya vimarsh se yagatirikt "apurv, naamak vastu samajhi jaati he
 Here, the aforesaid two powers of "one work word" have to be accepted in two meanings
 ek main shakti or duusare se lakshana manani hoti he
 It also has special power in supernatural work, as is prevalent among scholars - lok main kriya rup kaary main lakshana hoti he
 In the Vedas, verses are sentences, and substance is a sentence
 is mat main vaakyarth, anvay or sansarg ye sab paryaay hai
 That is, the unknown is the instrument in the unknown
 prabhakar ne graahak grahan ko mana he, usase bhi anvitabhidhanwaad siddh hota he
 In this opinion - "yajet Swargakam:" This sentence gives the literal meaning of Anavitabhidhan
 is darshan main swargaprapti ke liye yag kaa hi vidhaan he
 The meaning of heaven is this - one who does not suffer from sorrow and there is no possibility of causing sorrow and to fulfill the desire, it is called heaven
 "dashampoornamasabhyaan swargakaamo yajet" ityadi vaakyon dwaara darshapurnmaas yag se swarg ke saadhan kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 Yag is considered ephemeral, as Yag is the name of the sacrifice of matter for the purpose of a deity
 "indray idan na mam" is vaakya se maanas vyapaar kaa tyaag hota he
 That business is destroyed in that moment
 niratishay priti vishay ko swarg kaha gaya he
 It is obtained in the period of time or birth
 yah darshan shaastra kaa niyam he, kayontpatti ke avyavhit purv kshan main kaaran ko rahanaa chahie or kshanik yag janmaantar bhavi swargotpatti ke avyavhit purvakshan main sambhav nahin he
 Thus, according to the above Shruti, the attainment of Yag, the means of heaven or the succession of Yag and the precession of the fruit, these are all proved to be an object, which is called extravagance, apurva, or merit
 iskaa vistrut vivechan kumaril bhatta ne apurvaadhikaran main yuktipurvak kiya he
 The man before Yaganushthan does not have the ability to consume heaven
 anushthan ke purv yag main bhi swargadi fal dene kii yogyata nahin hoti evam purush kii ayogyata tathaa karm kii ayogyata kaa niraakaran kar shastragamya samathrya ab vaa atishayyogyata ko apurv mana gaya he
 As ise adhikarapurv athwa falapurv kehete hai
 Where there is only one principal, the incomparable that arises from the principal Yag is called antecedent
 angon se jo apurv utpann hota he, use angaporesv kehete hai
 Both Angaapurava and Pradhanpuram together produce the Holiness
 usase swargadi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Some yagas bear fruit from many heads
 udaahranarth - darsh main teen yag hote hai or paurnmaas main bhi teen yag hote hai
 Here one community pre-arises from the three antecedents arising from the three princes
 donon samudayapurvon se ek parmapurv utpann hota he
 It is meant that in the first example above, three are considered unique
 dwitiya udhaaharan main utpatypurv, angaporesv, samudayapurv or falapurv, chaar apurv maane jate hai
 It is the servants of all the Muslims
 isamen bhatt mimasak shabar bhashya 2
 1
 2 ke "yagen apurv kruthva swarg bhavayet" anusaar shabd se tathaa shrutarthapatti se apurv kii siddhi karte hai
 And consider it to be the main feature in Lingadi's speech and vocabulary
 sabhi darshanikon ke dwaara apurv kaa jo khandan kiya gaya he vah vachyatvansh or praadhanyansh kaa hi khandan he
 Four categories have been considered for philosophy in philosophy - pramaan prameya pramiti pramaata
 Proof - Proof is that which has a definite knowledge of the subject and the determination of the subject
 prameya - pramaan ke dwaara jiskaa gyaan ho use prameya kehete hai
 Pramiti - Any subject that has definite knowledge through proof, is called pramiti
 pramaata - pramaan ke dwaara prameya gyaan ko jo jaanata he - use pramaata kehete hai
 Here various Indian philosophers have given a dual idea about knowledge - gyaan kaa pramanya swat: grahya he athwa parat: grahya he
 Mimansak, Vedanti and Buddhists come in the automatic category
 parat: koti main nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, jain or charvak aate hai
 Here, from the word 'authentic', one should understand the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, rather than the knowledge of the nature of knowledge
 chodanalakshanodharm: sutara main - "nanu atthabhootampyarth bruyat chodana" ityadi bhashya se arthtathatv hi vivakshit he
 "tchcha abadhitatvam, Arthanrutho dharma special :, tasya gyanen nirupranat"
 chaudnaa sutara ke bhashya "atathatv bhootan arth" se abaadhitiv arthnishth dharm vivakshit he, jiskaa nirupan gyaan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, pramanya is called jnanamanthi
 vah parat: utpann or parat: gruhit hota he
 This is the doctrine of barbarians
 arthath jis saamagree se gyaan utpann hota he, usase pramanya utpann na hokar anya saamagree se utpann hota he evam jisase gyaan grahit hota he, usase pramanya gruhit na hokar anya gun gyanadi se gruhit hota he
 From this it came to be that authenticity arises from material other than knowledgeable material and knowledge is authenticated by content other than customer content
 is mat main pramanya or apramanya donon parat: hote hai
 This is a routine consensus review
 uparyukt mat main mimasak log anavastha dosha bataate hai jisase gyaanamat pramanya kabhi siddh nahin ho saktaa
 That is, public behavior will be broken
 at: gyaanagat pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 The idea is that the content from which knowledge is produced, the same material also produces credibility; And the material with which knowledge is acquired, the same material is recognized
 yahi swat:pramanyawaadee mimaskadikon kaa pramanya kaa swatastv he, jiskaa kumaril bhatta ne apane granth bhatt vaarthik main anek yuktiyon se samarthan kiya he - Knowledge is permissible here in Bhattmat
 gyaan ke vishay main kuch atishay utpann hota he jisase "gyatoghat:" yah anubhav hota he
 From this, a religion called knownness arises in the subject of Ghatadi, which is called by the words Prakatyam, Bhasanam, Prakash
 isse yah aayaa ki gyatata lingak anumaan se gyaan kaa grahan hota he
 This is also the eclipse of authenticity
 prabhakar mat main gyaan swayan prakaash he
 Therefore, knowledge leads to enlightenment
 atev swat: pramanya donon maton main samaan he, jiskaa vivechan "shloke vaarthik", "prakaran panjika", "nyaay ratnamala" main vistrut rup se kiya gaya he
 The method of interpreting sentences of eternal meaning from direct inference is called method
 arthath agyatagyapak apravritapravartak jo vaakya hai uskaa naam "vidhi" he
 There are two sides of the mindset with respect to the pupil - one considers the propagation as the pupil
 isamen praayash: sabhi mimasak aa jate hai
 The second one considers the work to be complete
 yah prabhakar kaa siddhant he
 This side produces this type of - lok main pravartak purush, acharya athwa raja apane shishy athwa bhrity ko pravrutt karaane ke liye "gammanay" ityadi vaakya kaa prayog karte he
 a disciple or devotee, listening to the said sentence, researches its meaning
 pashchaat "gavaanayan" aadi kaary main pravrutt hota he
 Therefore, the motive of promoter man is special, it is called Vidhyarth in the world
 vah purush kii kriya he jo purush main rahati he
 Hence, it is also called Purushabhipraya
 veda apaurushey hone ke kaaran vaidic lingadi kaa arth purushabhipraay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hence, the word Lingadi is used in place of a man
 uskaa vyaparvishesh hi vidhyarth he
 Being literate, it is also called Shabdi Bhavna
 iskaa lakshan is prakaar kiya gaya he "purushapravrityanukool: pravartak lingadinishtho vyaparvishesh: shabdi bhaavana"
 In the scriptures, it has been called the introduction, inspiration, etc
 lok main pravriti do prakaar kii hoti he - pratham apni ichha se purush pravrutt hota he
 The second promoter is the person, or person, by word, which is called "inspiration
" jahaan prerana ke pashchaat pravriti hoti he, vahaan pravartan gyaan hi pravartak mana jaataa he, jise mandan mishra, parthasarathi prabhruti vidwaanon ne "ishtsaadhan" mana he
 Justice Sudhakar has considered it to be a special supernatural religion
 prabhakar mishra ne pravriti ke prati kaaryatagyaan ko kaaran mana he, jisase ishtsaadhanatv aadi akshipt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, "chodna Sympto Religion:" is written in the sutra - "acharya Chodit" Karomi "while explaining this commentary, Shaliknath has said - Chodit: Promoted:, Karyambhavadh: Itartha, Karyagayana without Pravrittarasamvadhitti" Therefore Prabhakar is said in the opinion
 Is - "karya vidyarthi:, tachya karya dhatvarthatiabharatam, Apoorva word vachyam tadeva vidyartha eti" veda vaakyarth nirnay ke liye pravrutt mimasaa darshan main chaar prakaar kii vidhi kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he - Origin: The sentence by which the nature of karma is primarily known, is called genesis method
 udaahranarth "agnihotran juhoti" is vaakya se agnihotra naamak home se isht ko praapt karnaa arth hota he
 Appropriation method: The method by which the relation of the organ is known is known as appropriation
 udaahranarth "dadhna juhoti" is vaakya se dahi se havan karne kaa arth bodhit hota he
 It has Dadhi means and Home is practicable
 yahan viniyog vidhi main viniyog shabd se sambandh ko samajhnaa chahie
 That relationship ends in the practicable means, the angangi or the remaining
 prayogvidhi : jo pradhan or ang ke anushthan main kram kaa bodh karaata he use prayogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, heaven is attained by the Yajna, the principal worshiper of the Prayasadi organ
 isi abhipraay se lakshan kiya gaya he "angaanaan krambodhako vidhi; prayogvidhi:" Adhikavidhi: The method by which the karta of the karmajni fruit is regarded as the doer is called the Adhikavidhi
 udaahranarth "yajet swarg kaam:" yahan jo yagakarta he vahi swargfal kaa bhokta he
 In the same way, three types of methods are famous with distinction between Apoorva law, Rule method and Parvakhya method - upar vidhiyon ke do prakaar bataae gaye hai, use is prakaar samajhnaa chahie ki apurvavidhi main utpatti, viniyog prayog or adhikaar vidhi chaaron antargat hote hai
 Rule and number law is within the appropriation method itself

 humaraaz kaa taatpary nimna main se kisi se ho saktaa he: In fixed mechanics, Euler's rotational equations describe the rotational motion of fast objects with the help of the rotational instruction system
 isamen jo ghurni frem liya jaataa he uskaa aksh us pind se judaa hua tathaa pind ke mukhya jadtv akshon ke samaantar hota he
 Euler equations are simple quasi-linear first-order equations in vector
 islar samikarnon kaa saamaanya rup nimnlikhit he- Where m is the thrust applied, i is the inertial matrix, ω is the angular velocity relative to the principal axes
 3D mukhya lambkonik akshon main uparokt samikarnon kaa nimnlikhit rup ho jaataa he- Where Mk is the component of the charged force M, Ik is the component of principal inertial moment axis i and ωk is the direction of the principal axes
 islar ke dwitiya niyam se armbh karne par, ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra main, koniya samveg l kaa samay ke saapeksh avkalan aropit balaghurna ke baraabar hota he Where iin is the inertial computation calculated in the inertial direction system
 yadhyapi yah niyam saarvbhaumik satya he, yah samaanya ghurni drudh pind kii gati ke liye hal karne main hameshaa sahaayak nahin he
 Since both Iin and ω can change during movement
 atah ham nirdesh tantra ko is tarah parivartit karte hai ki vah ghurni pind ke saath sthir rahe or is tarah se chayan karte hai ki isaki aksh jadtwaghurna pradeesh kii disha main sthit hon
 In this reference system, at least the inertial display is fixed, which facilitates calculation
 jaisaa kii jadtwaghurna main samajhaayaa gaya he, koniya samveg Where Mk, Ik and ωk are as described above
 ghurni nirdesh tantra main, samay avkalaj ko Should be replaced with jahaan adholikhit "rot" ghurni nirdesh tantra ko nirupit kar rahaa he
 In the inertial and rotational reference systems, the expression related to the problem is: jahaan q ghurni pradeesh he, jo kisi koniya veg sadish v se sambandhit lamb koniya pradeesh he In the front diagram, a billiard ball with r radius, m mass and i inertia is hit parallel to the table in such a way that the ball moves forward without sliding on the table
 ham isamen yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki gend ke aadhaar se kis oonchaai par bal f lagaaya jaay taaki koi gharshan bal na hone ke vaavjood gend bina phisale, ludhakte hue aage bad jaay
 The force m = - f of the force exerted in the horizontal direction produces rotational acceleration in the ball - yahan balaghurna rinatmak liya gaya he kyonki yah ghurnan kone φ ke vipareet he 
 In addition to this equation, the force f applied to the ball causes an acceleration in its center of mass
 atah Note that the acceleration x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} is parallel to the table and in the direction of the force
 bina-sarake ludhakne ke liye aavashyak he ki- Thus all the above equations describe the motion of the ball in three variables h, φ, and x
 in samikarnon ko milakar hal karte hue hamen nimnlikhit jaankaree milti he- The inertia of a solid, homogeneous sphere is i = 2 5 mr 2 { \ displaystyle i = { \ tfrac {2} {5}} mr ^ {2}}
 yah maan rakhane par- r a wheel with radius, m mass and i inertia is rotating at a constant inclination at an angle α with the speed of gravitational acceleration g
 
 As this wheel is also shifting, linear acceleration of its mass is also taking place
 is samasya main ham yah maan rahe hai ki pahiye kii gati bina sarake ho rahi he
 Hence a frictional force r is produced between the plane and the wheel which rotates the wheel, because this force causes a fouling m = -r R
 yah balaghurna rinatmak liya gaya he kyonki yah ghurnan kone φ ke vipareet he
 Hence the following is the equation of the rotational speed of the wheel
 ab pahiye ke dravyaman kendra ke visthaapan par vichaar karte hai
 The value of element f in the direction of the plane of mass of the wheel, mg is f = mgsin
 yah bal gharshan bal ke ulti disha main kaary kar rahaa he
 So according to Newton's second law of motion - jahaan x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} pahiye kaa nat-samtal ke samaantar twaran he
 Also, if the rolling motion is unfixed then x ̈ = - r φ ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}} = - r { \ ddot { \ varphi}}}
 is prakaar hamane teen agyaat raashiyon R, φ tathaa x ko samete hue gati ke sameekaran praapt kar liye
 On solving these equations, we get isse yah dekha ja saktaa he ki kisi diye hue nat-kone α ke liye, adhiktam twaran tab hota he jab pahiye kaa dravyaman adhik-se-adhik uske aksh ke nikat ho
 
 dhyaan dijiye ki isi nat-samtal par, yadi gharshan shunya ho to, us par sarak rahe kisi pind kaa twaran x ̈ = g sin ⁡ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}=g \ sin} hoga, jo pahiye ke twaran se adhik he
 The reason for this is that the potential energy of the wheel is turning into two types of kinetic energy - the kinetic energy of rotation and the kinetic energy of transfer of center of mass; Whereas the moving body has only one kinetic energy - the kinetic energy of the center of mass transfer } Coordinates: 27 ° 53′N 78 ° 04′E / 27

 The Arab people are primarily associated with the Arabic language and culture although historically the definition of 'arab' has changed
 kuch kaalon main yah shabd keval badu logon ke liye prayog hua he jabaki anya kaalon main barbar log bhi isamen shaamil rahen hai
 If the most detailed definition of 'arab people' is taken, then their population is more than 300 million and according to some sources, this Han Chinese is the second largest human race in the world

 This Gindabu was the chieftain of the Arab faction in the Allies fighting against the Assyrians in this war
 'arab' naam kii utpatti kii sabase lokapriya kahani yah he ki yah ek 'yarab' naamak aadmi se aayaa he jo arabi bhashaa bolne vaala pehla vyakti tha
 al-hamdani, the ancient Arab intellectual, had a different opinion
 unka kahana tha ki kyonki arab log mesopotamia se pashchim main basate the, isliye unke liye 'garab' shabd istemaal hone laga, jiskaa arth arabi or anya sthaneey bhashaaon main 'pashchim' hota he
 This deteriorated into 'arab'
 ek anya pracheen arab itihaaskaar, al-masudi, kaa kahana tha ki shuru main yah naam 'arabah vaadi' ke nivaasiyon ke liye tha jo vistrut hokar puri jati ke liye prayog hone laga

 bahut se arab isai hote hai or kuch yahudee bhi hote hai

 Homi Jahangir Bhabha was a prominent scientist and dreamer of India who envisioned India's nuclear power program
 unhone mutthi bhar vaigyanikon kii sahaayta se march 1944 main nabhikeey urja par anusandhan armbh kiya
 He started working in nuclear science when the knowledge of unconnected chain reactions was negligible and no one was willing to accept the idea of power generation from nuclear power
 unhen 'architect of indian atomic energy program' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Bhabha was born into an elite Parsi family in Mumbai
 unki kirti saare sansar main faili
 On his return to India he continued his research
 bharat ko parmaanu shakti banane ke mishan main pratham pag ke taur par unhone 1945 main moolbhoot vigyaan main utkrushtataa ke centre tata institute of fundamental research kii sthapana kii

 In 1947, he was appointed the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission set up by the Government of India
 1953 main geneva main anushthit vishwa parmanuvik vaigyanikon ke mahasammelan main unhone sabhapatitv kiya
 The father of the Indian Atomic Energy Program died on 24 January 1966 in a plane crash
 unhone mumbai se cathedral or jon kenon skool se padhai kii
 Then passed bsc from Elphinstone College Mumbai and Royale Institute of Science
 mumbai se padhai puri karne ke baad bhabha varsh 1927 main england ke kshas college, cambridge ejineering kii padhai karne gaye
 He graduated from Cambridge University in 1930
 san 1934 main cambridge vishvavidhyalay se unhone doctorat kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 In Germany, he conducted studies and experiments on cosmic rays
 haalanki ejineering padhane kaa nirnay unka nahin tha
 It was the desire of the family to become a promising engineer
 homi ne sabaki baton kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, ejineering kii padhai jarur kii, lekin apane priy vishay physics se bhi khud ko jode rakhaa
 His passion for nuclear physics was up to obsessive levels
 unhone cambridge se hi pita ko patr likh kar apane iraade bataa die the ki physics hi unka antim lakshya he
 When the country became independent, Homi Jahangir Bhabha appealed to Indian scientists working across the world to return to India
 unki apil kaa asar hua or kuch vaigyanik bharat laute bhi
 One of them was Homi Nausherwanji Sethna, who worked at the Imperial Chemical Company of Manchester
 america kii michigan uniwarsity se post grajuation karne vaale sethna main bhabha ko kaaphi sambhaavnaaen dikhaai deen
 Both these scientists got involved in their program to make India a nuclear power
 yah kaarykram mul rup se dow bhabha kii hi dein tha, lekin yah sethna hi the, jinaki vajah se dow bhabha ke nidhan ke baavjood na to yah kaarykram rukaa or na hi isamen koi baadha ai
 The result of his passion was that in 1974 Sethna told the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that he had completed preparations for a peaceful nuclear explosion
 yah bhi poocha ki kya ve is system ko shuru kar sakate hai? iske saath hi unhone yah bhi bataa diya ki ek baar system shuru hone ke baad ise rokna sambhav nahin hoga, aise main agar ve manaa kar dengi to use nahin suna ja sakegaa kyonki tab visphot hokar hi rahegaa
 Preparations started as soon as Indira Gandhi got the green signal
 agle hi din, 18 may ko sethna ne code verde main indira gandhi ko sandesh bheja- buddha muskaraae
 This nuclear explosion of India was so secret
 dow homi bhabha ne dow sethna ko bharat lautne ke baad bahut soch-samaj kar kerala ke alwaaye sthit indian rer arths limited kaa pramukh banaaya tha, jahaan unhane monozite ret se durlabh nabhikeey padaartho ke ansh nikaale
 During that time he was also the project manager of the canada-india reactor
 iske baad dow sethna ne 1959 main trambe sthit parmaanu urja pratishthan main pramukh vaigyanik adhikari pad kaa kaarybhaar sambhala
 This establishment later became the Bhabha Atomic Research Center
 vahaan unhane nabhikeey grad kaa uranium taiyaar karne ke liye thorium sanyantr kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 His tireless efforts and skillful leadership enabled the construction of the first plant to isolate plutonium at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in 1959
 iske dizin or nirmaan kaa puraa kaam bhartiya vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron ne hi kiya
 It is noteworthy that later on, a nuclear device was prepared from plutonium isolated in the same plant, which exploded in Buddha Pokhran on May 18, 1974
 dow sethna ke maargdarshan main hi 1967 main jaadooguda se uranium hasil karne kaa sanyantr laga
 Dr
 Sethna also developed alloy-oxide fuel as an alternative to uranium fuel for nuclear reactors at Tarapur
 pokharan main parmaanu visphot ke baad america ne uranium kii aapurti par roak laga di thi, haalanki ye riactor america nirmit hi the
 May it be well of France that he helped us by giving uranium at a time, otherwise Dr
 Sethna had prepared to run the nuclear reactor of Tarapur with alloy-oxide
 dow sethna swaavlamban main vishwaas rakhte the or kisi bhi kaam ko puraa karne ke liye kisi ke ahsaan kii jarurat mahasoos nahin karte the
 He did not like political interference in scientific work
