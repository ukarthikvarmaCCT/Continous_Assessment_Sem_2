 a gun diode, also known as a transfer electron device, is a form of diode with negative resistance used in high frequency electronics, a two-terminal passive semiconductor electronic component
 yah bhautikavid je bi
 Is based on the "gun Effect" discovered in 1962 by Gunn
 iskaa sabase bada upyog electronic osillator main he, microwave utpann karne ke liye, jaise ki radar speed bandooken, microwave riley data link transmeter, or swachaalit darwaja kholane vaale
 Its internal construction is unlike other diodes, it only contains n-doped semiconductor materials, while most diodes include both p and n-doped regions
 isliye yah keval ek disha main nahin aati he or anya diod kii tarah vartmaan main sudhaar nahin kar sakati he, yahi vajah he ki kuch strot diod shabd kaa prayog nahin karte hai, lekin ted pasand karte hai
 In gun diodes, three regions are present: two of them are heavily N-doped at each terminal, with a thin layer of lightly N-dyed material
 jab ek voltage ko divaais par lagu kiya jaataa he, to patali madhyam parat main vidyut dhaal sabase bada hoga
 If the voltage is increased, the current through the layer will increase first, but eventually, at higher field values, the conductive properties of the middle layer change, its resistivity increases, and the current declines
 iskaa matlab he ki ek gan diod main isaki vartmaan-voltage visheshta vakr main nakaaratmak antar pratirodh kaa kshetra he, jisamen lagu voltage kii vruddhi vartmaan main kami kaa kaaran banati he
 This property allows it to act as a radio frequency amplifier, being unstable and unstable, and amplifying it when biased with a DC voltage

 Although the efficiency of blast furnaces is continuously developing, but still there is no change in the chemical process inside the blast furnace
 american aayran and steel institute ke anusaar: "sahasrabdi tak blast bhattiyon kaa vajood rahegaa kyonki badi or kaarykushal bhattiyon main anya louh nirmaan praudyogikiyon kii tulana main kam kharch par garm dhaatu kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 "one of the biggest drawbacks of blast furnaces is that they essentially produce carbon dioxide because carbon is converted to iron to obtain iron and there is no economical alternative - in the steelmaking world Carbon dioxide is one of the inevitable industrial contributors to emissions
 blast bhatti ke greenhouse gas utsarjan dwaara sthapit chunauti ko uelsioes ek chaalu europea kaaryam main sambodhit kiya ja rahaa he
 Several new process routes have been proposed and closely examined to cut specific emissions by at least 50%

 Louis moved to Washington to stay at the home of his cousins alan and Jane with Louis Ted in 1950
 The following year he married Johnny Kulpepper, a cook and singer

 Loved magazines, novels and films depicting rape since adolescence
 Drinking alcohol, he used to peep into the windows of the locality and watch the women taking off clothes
 He also used to search naked pictures in garbage cans
 During school, he was arrested twice for stealing
 But as per the rules, his criminal record was erased when he was 18 years old

 kuch samay baad aas-paas ke ilaakon main ladkiyaan gaayab hone lageen
 Although the evidence of Ted's crimes begins to mingle since 1974, some believe that he killed the eight-year-old Ann Marie Barr in 1961 at the age of 14
 Ted did not confess this crime after being arrested
 Ted told psychologist Art Norman that he first killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969
 On the other hand, he told his lawyer Pauli Nelson that for the first time in 1971 he had killed someone
 4 janvari 1974 kii raat ted 18-varshiya kairen sparks naamak student or dancer ke ghar main ghus gaya

 Over the next few months, many girls started disappearing in the surrounding area, and there was an uproar in the media
 The irony was that Ted had started working in the Government Emergency Services Department - this department used to deal with missing girls
 a few months later, the body of the missing girls was found in the jungles
 After questioning the locals, the police prepared a sketch and detailed description of the suspected criminal
 After seeing the sketch and description, four women bit their fingers at Ted
 These four women were: - Female police officer Ann Rule, an employee of the Department of Emergency Services, a professor of psychology at Washington University, and Elizabeth Chloefer, Ted's chammer
 But the policemen ignored the allegations of these four women
 It was not that the policemen were all boorish, the thing was that every day the names of about 200 suspects came to them
 agast 1974 main ted ko uta uniwarsity ke lau skool main admician mil gaya
 uske uta jate hi uta rajya main bhi jawan ladakiyon ke balatkaar or katl ke maamle saamne aane lage

 police ne ted ko kuch gavaahon ke saamne pesh kiya, par ye murkh gavaah use pahchaanane main naakaamayaab rahe
 disambar main elizabeth uta police ke paas chugali karne ja pahaunchi, par uta police bhi ted ke khilaaf saboot jutaney main vifal rahi
 In 1975, Ted began to commit felony acts in the state of Colorado
 He used to lure girls in public places by pretending to be a disability or by calling himself a government officer
 Then he would torture them by taking them to a lonely place, and kill them
 Often he used to return to these deserted places and have sex with the corpse
 He used to do this until the corpse was eaten by the animal or the corpse was completely rotting
 Sometimes he would kill his victim only by entering his house
 He had cut the heads of at least 12 victims, and some of them were kept as souvenirs at his home
 Ted was very handsome to watch, due to which stupid girls used to get trapped in his web
 Take 26-year-old Julie Cunningham as an example
 On 15 March 1975, Ted reached her with a crutches, asking for her help to take some goods to the car, claiming to be disabled
 The gullible Julie reached the car as soon as Ted put handcuffs in his hands, and took him to a lonely place and mistreated him and killed him
 Even small girls could not escape the evil intentions of this monster
 Now take Lionette Don Culver 


 Ted kidnapped this 12-year-old girl from school
 Then taking him to a hotel, submerged him in water and robbed him of his honor

 Initially Kurukshetra was called the sacrificial altar of Brahma, it was later called Samantpanchak, while Parshuram, in retaliation for his father's murder, made five kundas from the blood of the Kshatriyas, which, with the blessings of the fathers, were transformed into five sacred reservoirs in the course of time
 Are done aage chalakar yah bhoomi kurukshetra ke naam se prasiddh hui jab ki sanvaran ke putr raja kuru ne sone ke hal se saat kos kii bhoomi jot daali
 Kurukshetra was the center of Vedic culture in the Brahmin period and yagyas must have been performed there with expansion
 isi se ise dharmakshetra kaha gaya or devon ko devkirti isi se praapt hui ki unhone dharm kaa paalan kiya tha or kurukshetra main satron kaa sampaadan kiya tha
 It is mentioned in some Brahmin texts that there was a Kauravya king named Bahlik Pratipatiya
 taittiriya brahman main aayaa he ki kuru-paanchal shishir-kaal main purv kii ore gayi, pashchim main ve greeshm ritu main gayi jo sabase buree ritu he
 The mention of Aitareya Brahmin is very important
 saraswati ne kavash muni kii raksha kii thi or jahaan vah daudti hui gayi use parisarak kaha gaya
 At another place the Aitareya Brahmin has come to say that in his era 'nyagrodha' in Kurukshetra was called 'nyubj'
 aitarey brahman ne kuruon evam panchalon ke deshon kaa ullekh vash-ushinron ke deshon ke saath kiya he
 In the Taittiriya Aranyaka, there is a saga that the Devas did a session and for that Kurukshetra was in the form of an altar
 us vedi ke dakshin ore khandav tha, uttari bhaag turghn tha, prishth bhaag pareen tha or maru utkar tha
 This shows that Khandav, Turghna and Parin were the boundaries of Kurukshetra and Maru district was some distance away from Kurukshetra
 avashvalyan, latyayan evam katyayan ke shrautasutra tandya brahman evam anya brahmanon kaa anusaran karte hai or kai aise tirthon kaa varnan karte hai jahaan saraswat satron kaa sampaadan hua tha, yatha plaksh prastravarna, saraswati kaa vaitandhav-hrad; kurukshetra main pareen kaa sthal, kaarpachav desh main bahati yamuna evam triplakshavaharan kaa desh
 It is known that although Vanaparva mentions certain pilgrimages on the Saraswati coast and Kurukshetra in the 83rd chapter, they do not match with the pilgrimages mentioned in the Brahmins and the Shrutasutras, only in the case of 'vinashan' and 'sarak'
 Can go isse yah prakat hota he ki vanaparv kaa saraswati evam kurukshetra se sambandhit ullekh shrautasutron ke ullekh se kai shatabdiyon ke pashchaat kaa he
 Naradiya Purana has given the names of about 100 pilgrimages of Kurukshetra
 inkaa vivaran dena yahan sambhav nahin he, kintu kuch ke vishay main kuch kahana aavashyak he
 The first shrine is Brahmasar where King Kuru lived as a monk
 anshyent jiyagraphy aav india main aayaa he ki yah sar 3546 foot lambaa evam uttar se dakshin 1900 foot chaudaa tha
 Kurukshetra district is a plain area, 88 percent of which is cultivated and two crops are grown on most of the area

 Almost all the villages are connected by roads
 kurukshetra nagar main hathkargha, chini, krishi upkaran, pani ke upkaran or khaadya utpaada se jude udyog avasthit he
 The mythological significance of Kurukshetra is considered to be high
 iskaa rugveda or yajurveda main anek sthano par varnan kiya gaya he
 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance
 iske atirikt anek puraanon, smritiyon or maharishi vedavyas rachit mahabharat main iskaa vistrut varnan kiya gaya hai
 The special fact is that the mythological boundary of Kurukshetra has been reckoned to be 48 kos which includes the area of kaithal, Karnal, Panipat and Jind in addition to Kurukshetra
 iskaa rugveda or yajurveda main anek sthano par varnan kiya gaya he
 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance
 saraswati ek puranic nadi jisaki charchaa vedon main bhi he
 Apart from this, it has been detailed in many Puranas, Smriti and Mahabharata composed Maharishi Veda Vyasa
 vishesh tathy yah he ki kurukshetra kii puranic seemaa 48 kos kii maani gai he
 It has come in the forest festival that all the people of Kurukshetra are freed from sin and that too who always says - 'I will go to Kurukshetra and stay there
 ' is vishwa main isse badhkar koi anya punit sthal nahin he
 Even the mites of dust here give the ultimate rank to the sinner
 ' yahan tak ki ganga kii bhi tulana kurukshetra se kii gayi he
 The Naradaiya Purana states that the planets, constellations and stars are afraid of falling down from time to time, but those who die in Kurukshetra do not fall on the earth again, that is, they do not take birth again
 kurukshetra ambala se 25 mile purv main he
 It is a very sacred place
 iskaa itihaas puraatan gaathaon main samaa-sa gaya he
 In the Rigveda, the son of Trusadasu, Kurushravan is mentioned
 'kurushravan' kaa shabdic arth he 'kuru kii bhoomi main suna gaya yaa prasiddh
 In the Atharvaveda there is a discussion of a Kauravya husband, who talks to his wife
 brahman-granthon ke kaal main kurukshetra ati prasiddh tirth-sthal kaha gaya he
 a saga mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmana shows that the Devas performed a yajna at Kurukshetra in which they had previously denied the two Ashvinas to the yagya-bhaga
 maitrayani samhita evam taittiriya brahman kaa kathan he ki devon ne kurukshetra main satr kaa sampaadan kiya tha
 The implicit feeling in these utterances is that in the Brahmin era, the Vedic people gave great importance to the sacrifice of Yajna, as it is mentioned in the Rigveda - 'yajnayya Yajnamayajanta Devastani Dharmani Prathamanyasana
 ' The region which was repeatedly plowed by Kuru was named Kurukshetra
 kehete hai ki jab kuru bahut manoyog se is kshetra kii jutai kar rahe the tab indra ne unase jaakar is parishram kaa kaaran poocha
 Kuru said- 'whoever is killed here will go to the virtuous world
 ' indra unka parihaas karte hue swarglok chale gayi
 This happened many times
 indra ne devataaon ko bhi bataaya
 The gods said to Indra - 'if possible, make Kuru friendly to you, otherwise if people go there and go to heaven without sacrificing our part, our part will be destroyed
 ' tab indra ne pun: kuru ke paas jaakar kaha-'nareshwar, tum vyarth hi ksht kar rahe ho
 If any animal, bird or human being killed here by staying foodless or fighting it will be part of heaven
 ' kuru ne yah baat maan lee
 This place is called samanta-panchak or Prajapati's Uttaravadi
 kurukshetra kii paavan dharti par shri sthaneshwar mahadev mandir sthit he
 It is popular belief that before the war of Mahabharata, Lord Krishna, along with Arjuna, worshiped Lord Shiva and received his blessings
 is tirth kii visheshta yah bhi he ki yahan mandir va gurudvara ek hi divaar se lagate he
