 Preliminary observations suggest that cancer can be prevented through vitamin supplement stem, correlating human diseases with vitamin deficiencies, such as fatal anemia related to vitamin B12 deficiency and scurvy related to vitamin c deficiency it happens
 yah vyapak rup se cancer ke saath sahi sabit nahin hua he or vyapak rup se vitamin anupuran cancer kii rokthaam main prabhavi nahin sabit nahin hua he
 Eating cancer fighting ingredients are now considered more numerous and varied than before, so patients are now advised to consume fresh, unprocessed fruits and vegetables on a large scale for maximum health benefits
 mahamari vigyaan ke adhyayan darshaate hai ki vitamin d kii kami cancer ke jokhim ke badhane se sambandhit he
 However, the results of such studies should be treated cautiously, as they cannot imply that the relationship between the two factors means that one is the cause of the other
 The possibility that vitamin d protects against cancer is factored in
 The opposite is that exposure to sunlight increases the risk of malignancy
 surya ke sampark main rahane se manushya main vitamin d ke prakritik utpaadan main vruddhi ho jaati he, kuch cancer anusandhankartaaon ne tark diya he ki surya ke sampark main rahane vaali twachaa main atirikt vitamin d sanshleshan ke cancer nivaraneey prabhaav ke tulana main durdamata ke prabhaav ke badhane kii sambhaavna adhik hanikar hoti he
 In 2002, Dr
 William B
 Grant claimed that 23,800 premature cancer deaths annually in the United States were caused by exposure to insufficient UVB
 This number is less than 8800 deaths due to melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma, so overall exposure to the sun is beneficial
 ek anya shodh samooh anumaan he ki sanyukt rajya america main 50,000-63,000 or britain main 19,000- 25,000 vyakti vitamin d kii kami ke kaaran prativarsh samay purv cancer se mar jate hai
 The case of beta-carotene gives an example of the importance of clinical trials

 Daily use of tamoxifen, typically a selective estrogen receptor modulator for 5 years, reduces breast cancer risk by about 50% in high-risk women
 haal hi ke adhyayan kii ek report ke anusaar chaynaatmak estrogen receptor modulator reloxifen bhi temoxiphen kii tarah hi laabhakaari he or ucch jokhim yukt mahilaon main stan cancer ke khatre ko kam karata he iske parshv prabhaavon kaa profile adhik anukool he
 Raloxifene is a SERM similar to tamoxifen; It has been found to be just as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women
 is pareekshan main lagbhag 20,000 mahilaon par adhyayan kiya gaya, reloxifen ke parshv prabhaav temoxiphen se kam hai, yadhyapi yah adhik DCIS banane ke liye prakriya ko badhaava detaa he
 Finasteride, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, reduces the risk of prostate cancer, although it most commonly inhibits small-grade tumors
 brihadantra polips ke jokhim par cox-2 sandamak jaise rophecoxib or salecoxib ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan femilial adinometas poliposis rogiyon menour aam jansankhya main kiya gaya he
 In both groups, the incidence of colon polyp decreased significantly, but its effect appeared to be an increase of cardiac vascular toxicity
 vishesh cancer sambandhi anuvanshik utparivartanon ke liye ucch jokhim yukt vyaktiyon kaa anuvanshik pareekshan pehle se hi uplabdh he
 Carriers of genetic mutations that increase the risk of cancer may be more closely monitored, using chemical prevention or risk-reducing surgery
 cancer ke vanshaagat jokhim kii praarambhik pahchaan or cancer kii rokthaam ke upaay jaise shalya chikitsa yaa nigaraanee, ucch jokhim vaale vyaktiyon ke jivan ke liye bahut adhik laabhakaari ho sakate hai
 Antioxidant vaccines or vaccines have been developed to prevent infection by oncogenic infectious factors such as viruses, and therapeutic vaccines are being developed to stimulate an immune response against cancer specific epitopes
 jaisaa kii upar bataaya gaya he ki ek nivarak maanav pepiloma virus vexine upasthit he jo maanav pepiloma virus kii vishisht yon sancharit naslon ko lakshya banaata he, jo garbhashay greeva cancer or jananaang masson ke vikaas se sambandhit hai
 As of October 2007, only two HPV vaccines were available in the market: Gardasil and Sarvarix
 There is also a hepatitis b vaccine, which prevents infection from the virus from hepatitis B, a virus that is an infectious factor causing liver cancer
 ek kenayan melanoma vexine kaa bhi vikaas kiya gaya he
 Cancer screening is an effort to check for suspected cancer in a symptomatic population
 badi sankhya main swasth logon ke liye upyukt screening test apekshaakrit saste, surakshit hone chahie, inaki prakriya sankramak nahin honi chahie, sakaaratmak jhuthe parinaam kii dar bahut kam honi chahie
 If symptoms of cancer are detected, more definitive tests are performed to ensure diagnosis
 cancer ke liye screening vishesh maamalon main prarambhi nidaan main sahaayak he
 Early diagnosis can prolong life, but can virtually prolong the time leading up to death through lead time bias or length time bias
 bhinn durdamataaon ke liye kai vibhinn screening pareekshanon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he
 Breast cancer screening can be done by breast self-examination, although a study conducted in 2005 found this approach to be incorrect in more than 300,000 Chinese women
 mammogram ke dwaara stan cancer kii screening ek jansankhya main stan cancer ke nidaan kii ausat avasthaa ko kam karti he
 Within the ten years following the introduction of the mammographic screening program, the stage of diagnosis has decreased in one country
 badi-aant malashay ke cancer ko phekal oklt rakt pareekshan or colonoscopy ke dwaara jaancha ja saktaa he, jo badi aant ke cancer or mrityu dar donon ko kam karata he, purv durdam polip kii jaanch karke or use hataakar aisa sambhav he
 Similarly, cervical cytology testing helps in identification of pre-cancerous lesions
 samay ke saath, aise pareekshanon ke kaaran garbhashay greeva cancer kii ghatnaon or mrityu dar main kami aayi he
 Initially at the age of 15, it is advisable to self-test the Venus gland to check for Venus gland cancer
 prostate cancer kii screening digital guda pariksha ke saath prostate vishisht pratijan rakt pareekshan, kaa upyog karke kii ja sakati he, haalanki kuch adhikarik sansthaaen sabhi purushon main aisi screening ke kilaaf hai
 Screening for cancer is a matter of controversy in many cases, until it is discovered that the test will actually save lives
 The controversy is further exacerbated when it is not clear that the benefits of screening include clinical trials and potential risks of cancer treatments
 Are more effective than
 udhaaharan ke liye: prostate cancer kii screening ke samay, PSA pareekshan chote canceron ko pataa laga saktaa he, jo kabhi bhi jivan ke liye ghaatak nahin banate, lekin ek baar pataa chal jane par upachaar shuru karnaa hi hota he
 This condition is called overdiagnosis, which forces the man to undergo unnecessary treatment such as surgery and radiation complications
 prostate cancer kaa nidaan karne ke liye prayukt prakriyaayein parshv prabhaavon kaa kaaran ho sakati hai jinamein rakt pravaah or sankraman shaamil he
 Prostate cancer treatment can be the cause of incontinence and sexual dysfunction
 isi prakaar, stan cancer ke liye, haal hi main yah aalochana di gayi he ki kuch deshon main stan screening kaarykram samasyaon ko hal karne ke bajaay badha detaa he
 This is because screening in women in the general population can produce a number of virtual positive results, which require advance screening, due to which a large number of women are required to detect and treat only one case of breast cancer
 Treatment is done
 ek saarvajanik swasthya pariprekshya ke anusaar pap smear ke madhyam se greeva cancer screening, anya sabhi prakaar ke cancer kii tulana main keemat kii drushti se adhik laabhakaari he, yah bade paimaane par ek virus ke kaaran hota he, isamen spasht jokhim kaarak hai, is cancer ke prakritik prasar kaa tarika yah he ki yah saamanyatya dhire dhire kai varshon main failata he, isliye screening kaarykram ko ise jaldi pakad main le lene ke liye adhik samay mil jaataa he
 Furthermore, the test itself is cheap and very easy
 inhen kaarnon se, cancer screening ke liye vichaar karte samay naidanik prakriya or upachaar ke laabh tathaa jokhim par dhyaan dena mahatvapurn he
 Equally problematic is the use of medical imaging for cancer in people with no clear symptoms
 haal hi main khoje gaye incidentaloma kii jaanch main bahut jokhim he- ek saumy ghaav jise durdam samajha ja saktaa he or ho saktaa he ki iske liye sambhavit khatarnaak jaanch kii jaae
 Recent studies of CT scan-based screening for lung cancer in smokers have yielded equivocal results, since July 2007, systematic screening is not recommended
 sade-film ke chaati ke eks re ke yadricchik naidanik pareekshan, jo dhumrapaan karne waalon main fefdon ke cancer ke liye screen karte hai, is drushtikon ke liye laabhakaari sabit nahin hue hai
 Canine cancer screening has accurate results, but it is still in the early stages of research
 adhikansh cancer yaa to apane lakshanon or sanketon ke dwaara praarambhik rup se pahachaane jate hai yaa screening ke dauraan prakat hote hai
 None of these are definitive diagnoses, which usually require the advice of a pathologist, this pathologist must be a type of physician who specializes in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases
 jin logon main cancer kaa andeh hota he unki chikitsa pareekshan ke dwaara jaanch kii jaati he
 Common tests include blood tests, x rays, CT scans, and observation
 kai kaarnon se cancer kaa andeh ho saktaa he, lekin adhikansh durdamataaon kaa nishchit nidaan ek rog vigyaani ke dwaara cancer kii koshikaon ke utak vaigyanik pareekshan ke dwaara sunishchit kiya janaa chahie
 The tissue can be obtained by biopsy or surgery
 kai biopsy ek chikitsak ke karyaalay main hi kii ja sakati hai
 Biopsy of other organs is performed in the presence of an anesthetic, which requires surgery in the surgical chamber
 rog vigyaani ke dwaara die gaye utak nidaan prachurodbhavan karne vaali koshika ke prakaar ko bataate hai
 At the same time, the tissue scientist category of the knot also clarifies genetic abnormalities and other symptoms
 saath hi, yah jaankaree rogi ke purv nidaan kaa moolyankan karne main tathaa sarvottam ilaaj kaa chayan karne main upyogi he
 Cell genetics and immune tissue chemistry are other types of tests that a pathologist can perform on a tissue sample
 ye pareekshan un anvik parivartanon ke bare main jaankaree uplabdh kara sakate hai jo cancer kii koshika main hue hai or is prakaar se cancer ke bhavi vyavhaar or sarvottam upachaar ko bhi ingit karte hai
 Cancer can be treated by surgery, surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy or other methods
 therapy kaa chayan gaanth kii sthiti or shrenee tathaa rog kii avasthaa par nirbhar karata he, saath hi rogi kii saamaanya avasthaa par bhi nirbhar karata he 
kai prayogtmak cancer upachaar bhi viksit ho rahe hai
 The purpose of treatment is to eliminate cancer completely without harming the body
 kabhi kabhi ise shalya chikitsa ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he, lekin cancer kii aas-paas ke utakon par akraman karne kii pravriti yaa sookshm metastasis dwaara dur ke sthanon par fail jane kii pravriti aksar isaki prabhavita ko simit kar detii he
 The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by the toxicity of other tissues in the body
 vikiran saamaanya utakon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Because "cancer" refers to a class of diseases, it is unlikely that "cancer will always be the only treatment", yet there is only one treatment for all infectious diseases
 saidhantik rup se gaiyr hemetological cancer kaa ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he yadi ise puri tarah se shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa diya jaae, lekin yah sadaa sambhav nahin he
 When the cancer reaches other parts of the body by metastasis before surgery, it is usually impossible to completely remove it by surgery
 cancer kii pragati ke halsted namoonay main, gaanth sthanik rup se babbti he, fir lasika parvon tak fail jaati he or fir sharir ke anya sabhi bhaagon main
isi kaaran se chote canceron ke liye sthanik upachaar jaise shalya chikitsa kii lokapriyata bad gai he
 Even small localized tumors have a very high capacity for metastasis
 cancer ke liye shalyachikitsa kii prakriyaaon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai- stan cancer ke liye stanochhedan or prostate cancer ke liye prostate-chhedan 
 shalya chikitsa kaa lakshya hota he yaa to keval gaanth ko hataanaa yaa puure ang ko nikaal dena
ek cancer koshika nagn ankhon ke liye adrishy hoti he, lekin fir se vruddhi kar ke nayi gaanth bana sakati he, yah prakriya punrariti kehalaati he
 For this reason, pathologists examine surgically extracted specimens that, if healthy tissue limits are present, reduce the likelihood that microscopic cancer cells may remain in the patient's body
 praathmik gaanth ko nikaalane ke alaava, aksar shalya kriya avasthaa nirdhaaran ke liye aavashyak hoti he udhaaharan rog kii seemaa kaa nirdhaaran or is baat kaa nirdhaaran ki yah metastasis ke dwaara kshetreey lasika parvon tak pahunch gaya he yaa nahin
 Conditioning is the main determinant of pre-diagnosis and the need for collaborative therapy
 aksar, meru rajju sampeedan yaa antra baadha jaise lakshanon ko niyantrit karne ke liye shalya chikitsa jaruri hoti he
 This is known as mitigation treatment
 vikiran chikitsa main cancer kii koshikaon or sankuchit ganth ko nasht karne ke liye ynikaran vikiran kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be controlled externally by external ray radiotherapy or can be controlled internally through brachytherapy
 vikiran chikitsa kaa prabhaav sthanikrut hota he or chikitsa kiye jane vaale kshetra tak hi simit rahata he
 Radiation therapy damages or destroys the cells of the area to be treated, in this action the genetic material of these cells is destroyed to prevent further division and growth in the cells
 And destroy both normal cells, most normal cells recover from the effects of radiation and begin to function properly Are
 vikiran chikitsa kaa lakshya he adhik se adhik cancer koshikaon ko nasht karnaa, jabaki aas-paas ke swasth utakon ko hone vaale nuksaan ko simit karnaa
 Therefore, it is given in many parts, which gives healthy tissues a chance to recover in the intervening period
 vikiran chikitsa, kaa upyog lagbhag har prakaar kii thos ganth ke upachaar ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen mastishk, stan, garbhashay greeva, galaa, fefde, agnyashay, prostate, twachaa, pet, garbhashay, yaa komal utak sarcoma ke cancer shaamil hai
 Radiation therapy may also be used in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma
 prayek site ke liye vikiran kii khuraaq kai karkon par nirbhar karti he, ye kaarak hai, har prakaar ke cancer kii radio samvedansheeltaa or aas-paas ke utak yaa ang vikiran se nasht ho sakate hai yaa nahin
 Thus, in every type of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects
 rasochikitsa main un dawaaon se cancer kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he jo cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht kar sakati hai
 In current usage, the term "cookery" is used for cytotoxic or cytotoxic drugs that, unlike targeted therapies, affect rapidly dividing cells in general
 
 rasochikitsa dawaaen bhinn sambhav tareekon se koshika vibhaajan main baadha daalati hai, udhaaharan DNA kii pratikruti se yaa nav nirmit gunasutron ke pruthakkaran se
chemotherapy ke adhikansh rup tezi se vibhajit hoti hui sabhi koshikaon ko lakshya banaate hai, ye keval karkat kii koshikaon ke liye vishisht nahin hai, yadhyapi kuch vishistataa is vajah se aa jaati he ki adhikansh karkat kii koshikaayen diene kshati kii marammat main sakasham nahin hoti hai jabaki saamaanya koshikaon main aam taur par par ye kshamta hoti he
 Therefore, the cook has the potential to damage healthy tissues, especially tissues that have a high replacement rate
 These cells usually repair themselves after the surgery
 kyonki kuch dawaaen akele kii tulana main ek saath behatar kaary karti hai, isliye ek hi samay par do yaa adhik dawaaen di jaati hai
 This is called "combination cookery"; Most cook regimen regimens are given in combination only
 kuch prakaar ke leukemia or lasicarbud ke upachaar ke liye chemotherapy kii ucch khuraaq kii yaa puure sharir ke vikirnan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This treatment separates the bone marrow and hence the ability of the body to recover and reconstitute blood is severed
 is kaaran se, therapy ke pruthakkaran prabhaav se pehle asthi majja, yaa paridhiy rakt stambh koshika harvesting kii jaati he taaki upachaar ke baad "bachaav" sambhav ho
 This is known as autologous stem cell transplantation
 vaikalpik rup se, ek milan kiye gaye asambandhit daata se lee gayi hemetopoctic stem koshikaayen pratyaropit kii ja sakati hai
 Targeted therapy, which first became available in the late 1990s, had major effects in the treatment of several types of cancer and is currently a much more active research area
 isamen aise karkon kaa upyog shaamil he jo cancer koshikaon ke protein ko aniyamit karne ke liye vishishtikrut hote hai
 Small molecule targeted treatment drugs are usually inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, over-expressed, or other complex proteins within cancer cells
 pramukh udhaaharan hai thyrosine kynej sandamak imaatinib or jefitinib 
 Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the treatment factor is an antibody that binds exclusively to a protein on the surface of cancer cells
 udaahranon main shaamil hai stan cancer main prayukt kiya jane vaala anti- HER2 / neu pratirakshi trastucumeb or kai prakaar kii B-koshika durdamataaon main prayukt kiya jane vaala anti CD-20 pratirakshi rituximeb
 Targeted therapy may also include small peptides as a "homing device", which can form dams with the affected extracellular matrix around the knot or with receptors on the cell surface
 radio newclid jo in papteedon se jude hote hai, antat cancer koshika ko maar dete hai yadi newclid koshika ke aas paas apaghatit ho rahaa he
 In particular, oligo- or multimers of these bound materials are very important, as they increase the specificity and elongation of the knot
 prakaash gatik chikitsa cancer ke liye tihara upachaar he jisamen prakaash samvedak, utak oxigen, ore prakaash shaamil hai
 PDT is used for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma or lung cancer; PDT can also be useful in removing residual tissue residues after a large tumor is surgically removed
 cancer pratiraksha therapy bhinn chikitsa ranneetiyon kaa ek samooh he jise rogi ke apane pratiraksha tantra ko prerit karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he taaki vah gaanth se lard sake
 There are several methods to induce an immune response against the knot, these are intercostal BCG immunotherapy for superficial cystic cancer, and the use of interferone and other cytokines to induce immune responses in patients with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma
 Intensive research is being conducted on the vaccines to produce an immune response specific to several types of lumps, particularly malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma
 sipulukal-t prostate cancer ke liye aadhunik naidanik pareekshanon main ek vexine kii tarah kii ranneeti he, jisamen rogi se lee gayi drumashmi koshikaon ko prostetic amla phosphetege peptids ke saath lod kiya jaataa he, taaki prostate-vyutpann koshikaon ke khilaaf vishesh pratiraksha pratikriya ko prerit kiya ja sake
 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of immune therapy, as donor's immune cells frequently invade the knot under a graft-versus-knot effect
 isiilie, elloginenic HSCT, kai prakaar ke cancer ke liye autologus pratyaropan kii tulana main upachaar kii ucch dar kaa kaaran banati he, yadhyapi parshv dushprabhav bhi adhik gambhir hote hai
 The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking specific hormones
 hormone samvedi ganthon ke kuch saamaanya udhaaharan hai- vishesh prakaar ke stan or prostate cancer
estrogen yaa testosterone ko hataa dena yaa avaruddh kar dena aksar ek mahatvapurn atirikt upachaar he
 In certain types of cancers, the administration of hormones is relaxing, such as progestogen may be beneficial in medical terms
 vahikajanan jo tumor ko jivit rahane ke liye jaruri he
 Some, such as bevacizumab, have been recognized and are being used in medical use
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaon ke saath ek mukhya samasya yah he ki kai kaarak saamaanya or cancer yukt koshikaon main rakt vahiniyon kii vruddhi ko uttejit karte hai
 Anti-angiogenesis drugs target only one factor, so other factors continue to stimulate blood vessel growth
 anya samasyaon main shaamil hai prashasan kaa maarg, sthirataa kaa rakh-rakhaav or tumor vahika sanrachana par kriya or lakshyikaran
 Although control over cancer symptoms cannot be considered a treatment for cancer, it is an important determinant of cancer patients' quality of life and plays a major role in the decision as to whether a patient is capable of other treatments
 haalanki doctoron ke paas, cancer ke rogiyon main dard, matlee, ulti, diaria, raktasrav or anya aam samasyaon ko kam karne ke liye chikitsakeey kaushal hota he, rogiyon ke is samooh kii lakshan niyantran kii aavashyaktaaon ke liye pratikriya main prashamak dekhbhaal kii bahul anushaasanamak visheshta kaa vikaas hua he
 Pain medications, such as morphine and oxycodone, and antiemetics to prevent nausea and vomiting, are commonly used in patients with symptoms related to cancer
 parishkrut antiemetics jaise ondencetron or ainalogus, saath hi aprepitint ne cancer rogiyon main ugr upachaar ko adhik sambhav bana diya he
 Chronic pain due to cancer is always due to continuous tissue damage that is related to the disease or treatment process
 Although effective disturbance also plays a role in the production of environmental factors and pain behaviors, patients with cancer pain are generally prominent
 Etiological reasons are not
 iske alaava, cancer se sambandhit bhayankar dard se yukt adhikansh rogi apane jivan kii antim avasthaa main hote hai or unhen prashamak chikitsa kii zarurat hoti he
 Issues such as social stigma of drug use, work and functional status and health care are not more important in overall case management
 atah, cancer dard prabandhan ke liye vishisht ranneeti he nashile padaarthon or anya dawaaon, shalya chikitsa or bhautik tareekon ke upyog ke dwaara rogi ko adhik se adhik aaraam pahunchne kii koshish karnaa
 Doctors do not want to use narcotics for pain in patients with end-stage cancer because they may be addicted to it or obstruct their breathing
 prashamak dekhbhaal, dekhbhaal andolan kii ek nai shakha he jo cancer ke rogiyon main dard ke upachaar main adhik vyapak sahyog pradaan karti he
 Fatigue is a very common problem for cancer patients and recently its treatment has become very important for oncologists, although it plays an important role in quality of life in many patients
 naidanik pareekshan, jo anusandhan adhyayan bhi kehalaate hai, cancer ke rogiyon main nae upachaaron kaa pareekshan bhi karte hai
 The goal of this research is to find better ways to treat cancer and to help cancer patients
 naidanik pareekshan kai prakaar ke upachaaron kaa pareekshan karte hai jaise nayi dawaaen, surgery yaa vikiran chikitsa ke nae drushtikon, upachaar ke nae sangyojan, yaa nai vidhiyaan jaise jin therapy
 a clinical trial is one of the last stages of a long and vigilant cancer research process
 nae upachaar ke liye khoj prayogshaala main shuru hoti he, jahaan vaigyanik pehle nae vichaaron kaa pareekshan or vikaas karte hai
 If an approach seems to be useful, then the next step is to test it on an animal, which will tell what effect it will have on the cancer patient and whether it has any harmful effects
 beshak, kai upachaar jo prayogshaala main yaa pashuon main acchhee tarah se kaam karte hai, ve hameshaa manushya main kargar sabit nahin hote hai
 Studies are done in cancer patients to find out whether the treatments considered useful are safe and effective
 ho saktaa he ki jo rogi isamen bhaag le rahaa he use is upachaar se vyaktigat rup se madad mili
 They receive state-of-the-art protection from cancer specialists and receive either a new treatment being investigated or the best available standard treatment for cancer
 saath hi, nae upachaaron main agyaat jokhim bhi ho sakate hai, lekin yadi nae upachaar prabhavi yaa maanak upachaaron se adhik prabhavi sabit hote hai, to adhyayan kiya jane vaala rogi iske laabh ko praapt karne vaala pehla vyakti ban jaataa he
 There is no guarantee that a new treatment tested or a standard treatment will produce good results
 cancer yukt bacchon main, ek surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki jin bacchon par aise pareekshan kiya gaye unamem ausatan maanak upachaaron kii tulana main behatar yaa bure parinaam nahin dekhe gaye; isse yah sunishchit hota he ki kisi bhi prayogtmak upachaar kii safalataa yaa asafalataa kaa purvanumaan nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Complementary and alternative medicine are a diverse set of treatments, therapies, healthcare systems, practices and products that are not part of traditional medicine
 "poorak chikitsa" kaa arth un vidhiyon or padaarthon se he, jinka upyog parmparik chikitsa ke saath kiya jaataa he
 Whereas "alternative medicine" refers to compounds that are used in place of traditional medicine
 CAM kaa upyog cancer se yukt logon main aam he; 2000 main kiye gaye ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki 69% cancer rogiyon ne kam se kam ek CAM chikitsa kaa upyog apane cancer upachaar ke ek hisse ke rup main kiya he
 Most complementary and alternative therapies for cancer have not been rigorously studied or tested
 kuch vaikalpik upachaar, jin par jaanch kii gayi he or ve nishprabhavi hai, unka lagaataar vipanan ho rahaa he or unhen protsaahan mil rahaa he
 Due to the increasing age of expectant mothers, there is an increase in the incidence of concurrent cancer during pregnancy, another reason for the increase in these events is the examination of the mother in the context of prenatal ultrasound tests
 maa or uske bhrun / bachche donon ko kam se kam nuksaan pahunche, iske liye cancer upachaar ko chaynit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 In many cases a medical abortion may be advised
 vikiran chikitsa par aamtaur par koi sawaal nahin uthaaye jate hai or rasayan chikitsa main hameshaa garbhpaat or janmajaat virupataaon kaa khatara bana rahata he
 Very little is known about the effects of therapy on the child
 yahan tak ki ek dawa jis par pareekshan kiya gaya he ki yah aparaa se hokar bachche tak nahin pahunchati he, cancer ke kuch rup aparaa ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai or dawa isamen se hokar chali jaati he
 Some forms of skin cancer can also enter the child's body through metastasis
 nidaan bhi zyada kathin ho gaya he, chunki isaki ucch vikiran khuraaq kii vajah se kamaputed tomography avyavhaarya he
 Nevertheless, magnetic resonance imaging works normally
 haalanki vipareet media kaa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa he, chunki ve aparaa ko paar kar jate hai
 As a result of difficulties in properly diagnosing and treating cancer during pregnancy, alternative methods are used, either using a caesarean section to initiate more severe cancer treatment or If the cancer is so severe that the mother's treatment cannot be further delayed, then abortion is done to treat the cancer
 kabhi kabhi garbhashay main rahete hue hi bhruneey ganthon kaa nidaan kiya jaataa he
 Teratomas are the most common type of fetal tumor and are usually benign
 cancer ko ek ghaatak rog ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 While this certainly applies to particular types, the hidden truth behind the historical facts of cancer has changed due to modernization in the medical field
 cancer ke kuch prakaaron main aise lakshan paae gaye hai, jo kuch adurdam rogon jaise hriday kaa asafal hona or hriday aghat se behatar hai
 Progressive and rapidly spreading malignancy has a major impact on the quality of life of a cancer patient and many cancer treatments can have serious side effects

 Nityasiddhi God is not accepted in the opinion of Nirishvara Sankhyas, but even if Niteshwar is not accepted in that opinion, the power of Kameshwar is considered
 purush vivekkhyati kaa laabh kiye bina hi vairaygy ke prakarsh se jab prakrutilin ho jaataa he tab use kaivalyalabh nahin hota or uskaa pun: udbhav abhinav sristi main hota he

 These are similar to Karyeshwar of Vidyeshwar Samkhya, not like God
 vigyanakal naamak chidanu maaya tatv kaa bhed kar uske upar videh tathaa vikaran dasha main vidyaman rahete hai
 All of these exist in Kaivalya state after attaining self-awareness of nature and Maya

 That is why the texts were written by these sects for the omniscience accomplishment by denying God
 mahapandit ratnakirti kaa 'ishwar-saadhan-dooshan' or unke guru gaudeey gyanshri kaa 'ishwarvadadushan' tathaa 'vaarthik shatshloki' vyaakhyaan prasiddh hai
