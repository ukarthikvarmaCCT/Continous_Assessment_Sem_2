 With regard to the name of this province as Kurmachal or Kumaon, it is popular among the people of Kumaon that when the second incarnation of Lord Vishnu was of Kurma or tortoise, that avatar is said to be in the Kurma mountain east of the Champawati river which is nowadays called Kandev or Kanadeva says, stood for 3 years
 us samay haahaa huhu devatagan tathaa nardadi munishwaron ne uski prashansa kii
 The symbol of the feet of that kurma-avatar is said to be in stone and it is said to be still existing
 tab se is parvat kaa naam kurmachal ho gaya
 The natural form of Kurmachal became 'kumu' deteriorating and the same word was changed to 'kumaon' in the language
 pehle yah naam champavat tathaa uske aasapaas ke gaanvon ko diya gaya
 After that the Kali river banks - Chalasi, Gumdesh, Regu, Gangol, Khilafati and the same Dhyanirou strips found from them also became known as Kali Kumaon
 jyon-jyon chandon kaa rajya-vistaar badha, to kurmachal urfe kumaun is saare pradesh kaa naam ho gaya
 The same thing is prevalent among everyone that Kumaon got its name due to Kurmaparvat, but Tha
 Jodhsingh Negiji writes in 'himalayas-yatra' - "the people of Kumaon are adept at farming and earning money
 ve bade kamau hai, isse is desh kaa naam kumaun hua"
 Kali Kumaon derives its name not from the Kali River, but from the name of Kalu Tadagi, who once ruled in Champawat
 in tathyon ko sweekaar karnaa he ki kisi bhu-pradesh kaa naam kisi raja ke naam se prachlit hona sarvadeshik niyam nahin hai

 The name of Champawat in Khasi Kumaon is called 'kumu'

 Science has special knowledge of nature
 yadhyapi manushya pracheen samay se hi prakruti sambandhi gyaan praapt karata rahaa he, phir bhi vigyaan arvachin kaal kii hi dein he
 It started in this era and within a short time it has made great progress
 is prakaar sansar main ek bahut badi kranti hui or ek nai sabhyataa kaa, jo vigyaan par aadhaarit he, nirmaan hua
 The perfect method of testing the universe also developed slowly
 kisi bhi cheez ke bare main yon hi kuch bolne va tark-vitark karne ke bajaay behatar he ki us par kuch prayog kiye jaayen or uskaa saavdhaanee purvak nirikshan kiya jaay
 The results of this method are universal in the sense that one can test the data obtained by repeating those experiments
 satya ko asaty va bhram se alag karne ke liye ab tak avishkrut tareekon main vaigyanik vidhi sarvshereshth he
 In short, the scientific method works as follows: kisi vaigyanik siddhanth yaa pariklpana kii sabase bady visheshta yah he ki use asaty siddh karne kii gunjaaish honi chaiye
 While religious beliefs are such that there is no scope to disprove them
 udhaaharan ke liye 'jo jisas ke bataaye maarg par chalenge, keval ve hi swarg jaayenge' - isaki satyata kii jaanch nahin kii ja sakati
 The question is: who is responsible for the rapid progress of science? Did humans of ancient times have less intelligence than these archaic scientists? If this is the case, then why did the advancement of philosophy, literature and fine arts grow so much in ancient times? Perhaps its secret lies in the scientific methods, by which science has been able to progress so much
 arvachin vigyaan kaa aarambh lagbhag teen sau varsh purv hua
 As mentioned above, there was some advancement of science in ancient times, but its sequence could not progress further
 isliye kuch baat iske peeche avashya rahi hogi
 In fact, whatever knowledge the mystics acquired from ancient times, it would be right to call it intellectual
 apni buddhi or tark ke bal par gyaan kii ucch koti kii baaten unhone bataayin, kintu unke prakaar or vardhan kii vyavastha nahin thi or sansar bhar main unka vyapak prachaar or prasaaran nahin ho paaya arvachin vigyaan iske vipareet praayogic gyaan he, jiskaa aarambh main bada virodh hua
 As a result, leading scientists like Galileo had to endure severe torture
 phir bhi prayog dwaara satyaapan vidhi ke bheetar hi prasaaran kaa beej bhi chipa hua tha
 In this way, the knowledge gained was tied up in a series whose order continued
 is gyaan se shakti ke nae nae sroton kaa pataa chalaa or parinamswaroop na keval iskaa virodh kam hota gaya apitu ek bahut badi kranti samaaj main hui
 The machine era heralded and a new ray of hope emerged in the world
 kintu jis prakaar sabhi vastuon ke saath achchhai or buraai donon ke pahalu jude hue hai, vigyaan bhi maanav ke liye keval vardaan hi na rahaa, uskaa pashachik rup hiroshima main atum bam ke rup main vishwa ne dekha, jiske visphot ke kaaran sansar ke vinaash tathaa pralay kii lila kaa drishy upasthit ho gaya
 Thus, there was a need to not search for "truth only for truth" in front of the world and it was known to adopt the image of "satya Shivam Sundaram" in science world too
 vigyaan is prakaar niyantrit hokar hi maanav kalyaan main yogadan kar saktaa he
 This control resulted in atomic kilns, which are just controlled atom bombs, but which can provide immense facilities
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki alp kaal main hi vigyaan ne badi unnati kii or iskaa sab shrey prayogvidhi ko he, jiskaa upyog pracheen samay main nahin kiya gaya tha
 The importance of experiment is of paramount importance in this method, yet other methods are also used in a particular way and order, which we can call scientific methods
 vigyaan ke adhyayan main jin vidhiyon kaa upyog samuhik rup se athwa aanshik rup se kiya jaataa he, unka neeche varnan kiya ja rahaa he : Observation - Careful inspection of the natural object or phenomenon to be studied is first necessary
 yadi koi ghatana kshanik ho, to uskaa chithran kar lenaa aavashyak he, taaki baad main uskaa nirikshan ho sake, jaise grahan
 Microscopes or telescopes can be used for inspection, so that more detail can be inspected more precisely
 yadi anya log bhi nirikshan kaa kaary kar rahe hon, to uskaa swaagat karnaa chahie ki keval nirikshit vastu par hi dhyaan kendrit rahe, jaise arjuna ko vanvidya ke pareekshan ke samay keval pakshi kaa sir dikhaai pad rahaa tha
 Sometimes there is already some perception in the brain about which object, which is very obstructing in unbiased inspection
 nirikshan ke samay is prakaar kii dharanaon se unmukt hokar kaary karnaa chahie
 Description - Write a description of the object or event that is inspected as well as, or immediately after, the inspection
 iske liye nape-tule shabdon kaa prayog karnaa chahie, jisase padhanevaale ke saamne nirokshit vastu kaa chitra khinch jaae
 Wherever it is necessary, by estimation one should measure the quality of the object in the figures, but it should be done only when it is to be proved useful later
 phulon ke rang kaa varnan karte samay anumaanit tarangadairghy dena vyarth he, kintu kisi vastu kii kathorta kii tulana anya vastu kii apeksha ankon main dena hi thik he
 Vain details should not be given and the language should be simple and comprehensible
 desh, kaal evam vaataavaran kaa varnan de dena chahie taaki vastu kin paristhitiyon main uplabdh ho sakati he, yah gyaat ho sake
 Action-reason-deliberation - Explanation of action is important in the revelation of nature
 varsha kaa hona, badal kii garaj, bijli kii chamak, aandhi or tufaan aadi ghatnaayen saath ho sakati hai
 Who has so many reasons? Often the reason comes first, but only the sequence does not determine the cause
 isliye in baton par thodavichaar kar lenaa chahie, taaki aage kisi prakaar kaa bhram na paidaa ho
 Also, the sequence of various reasons should be tied
 ye sab baaten ghatana ko samajhane main sahaayak hoti hai
 Experimentation - The only credit for the rapid advancement in this age of science is to this method, because other methods have been built around this main method
 yah takanic is yug kii dein he
 Science could not progress in the absence of this in ancient times
 antarikshayatra ev parmanviya shakti kaa vikaas, isi prayogikaran ke kaaran, sambhav ho sakaa he
 What is the difference between experiment and simple inspection? Even in the experiment, there is the work of inspection
 vastav main saadhaaran nirikshan main prakruti ke saath kisi prakaar kaa dakhal nahin diya jaataa, kintu prayog main dakhal diya jaataa he
 As a result, such possibilities and situations emerge from which the inspection of the time of the experiment is very helpful in the revelation
 prayog satya jaanane ke liye kiye jate hai, kintu nirantar vaigyanik prayogon ke falswaroop aisi sthiti paidaa ho gai he ki keval satya ke hi naam par prayog karnaa shreyaskar nahin, yadi vah satya mangalakaari na ho
 What benefit is there from the truth that results in the destruction of the entire world
 isliye acha hi he ki is samay saare sansar main parmanviya pareekshan kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 These tests are being conducted by some nations only to find the truth, but as a result, radioactivity is increasing and may, in future, pose a huge threat to life
 prayog karte samay sachai or eemaandaaree baratani padati he
 Corrections and errors have to be taken care of
 anek vibhinnataaon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat koi parinaam nikaala jaataa he
 If something inconsistent is shown, it is not left out, but it is carefully considered
 kabhi-kabhi isi kram main bade-bade avishkaar hue hai
 The inspection is repeated several times and the mean result is emphasized
 takneekee bhashaa main vidhi, nirikshan evam parinaam kaa varnan kiya jaataa he
 Hypothesis - The sole purpose of experimenting is the opening of a mystery of nature
 koi ghatana kyon or kaise ghatit hoti he, isko samajhnaa padataa he
 Why does it rain? How does a rainbow form? a hypothesis is required to answer these types of questions
 yadi pariklpana thik he, to vah jaanch main thik baithegi
 Various experiments can be done to test the hypothesis
 aage chalakar aise tathy bhi prakaash main aate hai jo us pariklpana kii pushti kar sakate hai
 If there are such things, then the same hypothesis is called a theory or rule, otherwise it has to be amended, or discarded

 Arrival - When certain properties of certain members of a class are known, it is called estimation based on the properties of that particular class
 udhaaharan ke liye, a, ba, sa aadi
 Human beings are mortal beings; Based on this, it is said that all human beings are mortal beings
 is prakaar ke samanyikaran ke liye yah aavashyak he ki jo namoonay ikatthe kiye jaaen, ve aniyat tareeke se kiye jaaen, nahin to jo parinaam nikaala jayega vah thik nahin hoga
 Sometimes the mean of some zodiac signs is calculated, but it is only right to do so when it is logical to do so
 udaahranarth, "lekha jokha thahe, ladkaa duba kaahe" se pataa chalata he ki nadi kii ausat gaharaai kisi ladke kii oonchaai se kam hote hue bhi ladkaa dub saktaa he
 Incorporation - The work done in Advent is reversed
 isamen kisi varg vishesh ke gunon ke aadhaar par us varg ke kisi sadsy ke gunon ke bare main anumaan lagaaya jaataa he, jaise maanav maranshil praani he, isliye "k", jo ek manushya he, maranshil he
 This method of drawing conclusions is called incorporation
 iske liye do baaten aavashyak hai: nigaman vyavhaarya or tarksangat hona chahie
 Mathematics and patterns - many things are beyond our comprehension, modeling helps a lot in understanding them
 sharir kii aantarik rachana, anuon kaa sanghathan aadi vishay praturup kii sahaayta se acchhee tarah bodhgamy ho jate hai
 Mathematics also helps a lot in solving difficult science questions
 bahut si aisi baaten hai jo hamaari gyanendriyon dwaara aatmsaat nahin kii ja saktin, jaise padaarthtarangen, kintu ganit ke sutron ke dwaara unki chaanbin sambhav ho pai he or prayogon dwaara unki pushti bhi hui he
 Thus we see that mathematics has a big role in the progress of modern science
 vaigyanik drushtikon - ant main ek bahut hi mahatvapurn vidhi rah jaati he
 It is the adoption of a scientific approach to a question
 khule dimag se khoj kii bhaavana rakhkar vichaar karnaa hi sahi drushtikon he apane vyaktitv ko prashn se alag rakhana chahie or sachai evam pakshpatarahit bhav se kisi nishkarsh par pahunchnaa chahie
 It is best to adopt this kind of approach even in everyday questions of life

 All martial arts have a common purpose: to protect themselves or others from any physical danger
 marshall art ko vigyaan or kala donon mana jaataa he
 Many of these arts are also practiced competitively, mostly in fighting games, but can also take the form of dance
 marshall arts kaa matlab yuddh kii kala se he or ye ladaai kii kala se judaa pandrahavin shatabdi kaa europea shabd he jise aaj aitihaasik europea marshall arts ke rup main janaa jaataa he

 Dardi or Dardic languages are a subdivision of indo-aryan languages, whose most well-known language is Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"
 hindu kush uttari pakistan ke vivaadeet bhaag se madhya afghanistan tak vistrut ek 800 kimi chalane vaali parvat shrunkhlaa he
 Its highest mountain is the 7,708 meter long Tirich Mir mountain located in Chitral district of khyber-pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan
 hindu kush pamir parvaton se jaakar judate hai or himalay kii ek upashakha maane jate hai
 The second highest mountain of the Hindu Kush is the Noshak mountain and the third is the istor-o-nal
 hindu kush pahaado kii atyaadhik oonchaai ke baavjood is shrunkhlaa main bahut se darre hai jinase is shrunkhlaa se logon kaa aana-janaa sadiyon se bana hua he
 The Hindu Kush mountains were called 'pariarat Parvat' in Sanskrit
 jab is ilaake main sikandar mahaan kii jeet hui to in parvaton ko unani bhashaa main 'kaukasosh indikaush' yani 'bhartiya parvat' bulaayaa jane laga
 Later they were named 'hindu Kush', 'hindu Kuh' and 'kuh-e-hindu'
 'kuh' yaa 'koh' kaa matlab to farsi main 'pahaad' hota he lekin 'kush' ke matlab ko lekar vivaad he
 According to Ibn Battuta in 1333 AD, it meant 'to kill'
 iskaa taatpary yah nikaala gaya ki uttari bhartiya upmahadweep par arabon-turkon ke qabze ke baad hinduon ko ghulaam banaakar in parvaton se le jaaya jaataa tha or unamem se bahut yahan barf main mar jaaya karte the
 Conversely, according to some scholars, 'kush' is simply another form of 'kuh', or a distorted form of 'hindu Kash' or 'hindu Kesh', which means 'border of India'
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki yah 'kaukasosh indikaush' vaale unani naam kaa do hazaar varshon ke baad kaa bigadaa hua rup ho
 Note that there is also a mountain range called Hindu Raj between the Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountains

 The slogan of Jai Hind given by him has become the national slogan of India
 "tum mujhe khun do main tumhe aazaadee duungaa" kaa naaraa bhi unka tha jo us samay atyadhik prachlan main aayaa
 Some historians believe that when Netaji tried to get help from Japan and Germany, the British government ordered his spies to end them in 1941
 netaa ji ne 5 july 1943 ko singapore ke toun haal ke saamne 'supreme commander' ke rup main sena ko sambodhit karte hue "dilli chalo!" kaa naaraa diya or japani sena ke saath milakar british va kamanwealth sena se burma sahit imphal or kohima main ek saath jamkar morcha liya

 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall

 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921

 Inspired by the work of the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das of Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai main gandhi ji manibhawan main nivas karte the
 Gandhiji and Subhash met for the first time on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji ne unhen kolkata jaakar dasababu ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di
 Subhash then came to Kolkata and met Dasbabu
 un dinon gandhi ji ne angrez sarkaar ke khilaaf asahyog andolan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Dasbabu was leading this movement in Bengal
 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality

 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names

 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him 
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey
 is din ke baad ve kabhi kisi ko dikhaayi nahin diye
 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention
 kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh de diya he
 This petition has been filed by the government organization India Smile

 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
 navambar 1945 main dilli ke laal kile main aaazaad hind fouj par chalaaye gayi mukademe ne netaji ke yash main varnanaatit vruddhi kii or ve lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja pahunche
 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 ghar–ghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India
 aaazaad hind fouj ko chhodkar vishwa-itihaas main aisa koi bhi drushtaant nahin miltaa jahaan tees-pantis hajaar yudhbandiyon ne sangathit hokar apane desh kii aazaadee ke liye aisa prabal sangharsh chhedaa ho
 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses
 swatantryavir saavarkar ne swatantrata ke uparant desh ke krantikariyon ke ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya tha or usamen adhyaksh ke asana par netaji ke tailchitr ko asin kiya tha

 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript

 The initial plan was to publish 'samagra Sahitya' in 10 volumes, but later the scheme was reduced to 12 sections
 april 1980 main sarvapratham bangla main iske pratham khand kaa prakaashan hua tha or november 1980 main angreji main
 Its first volume in Hindi was published in 1982 and then overall literature in these three languages continued to be published
 iskaa antim khand 2011 i0 main chap kar aa paaya; haalanki isaki saamagree pehle se hi taiyaar thi
 Sugat Bose was also associated with the compilation and publication work of this 'samagra Vaamay' and the last two volumes were published mainly due to the sad demise of Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose in the editing of Sugat Bose itself
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke pratham khand main unki 'aatmakatha' ke saath kuch patron kaa prakaashan hua he or dwitiya khand main unki suprasiddh pustak 'bharat kaa sangharsh' kaa prakaashan hua he
 Then in other sections, there is a systematic publication of the entire available literature, such as letters written by him, comments and speeches
