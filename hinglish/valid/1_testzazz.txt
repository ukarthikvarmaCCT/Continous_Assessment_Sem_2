 There is a correlation in the life, size, shape, surface composition and color of birds
 usee prakaar ek thok yaa samooh ke antargat andon kii sankhya or kisi ritu main thokon kii sankhya main ek sambandh hota he
 The measurement of an egg depends mainly on the dealings of the egg laying bird, but it is not necessary that the ratio is always the same
 iske do kaaran hai : The size of the hen's egg is often the same size as the eggs of other birds
 anda ek disha main lanbaa hota he or uskaa ek chor golakaar or doosraa chor thodaa nukila hota he
 The eggs do not roll easily because they are round at one end and pointed at the other end

 Most birds, if their eggs are stolen, or destroyed, or they are forced to abandon the eggs, lay eggs again, because every bird has a certain number of eggs

 Sparrows usually lay once in a season

 Birds incubate eggs with great dedication, keeping them warm with their wings and protecting them: adhikansh jatiyon main nar or maadaa donon hi andsevan kaa kaary karte hai, bhale hi andey sene kaa kaary ek thodaa karata he to doosraa adhik
 Sometimes the female incubates eggs during the day and the male at night
 kuch jatiyon main keval maadaa hi andey seti hai, kintu aisi avasthaa main nar uske liye bhojan jutata he
 Males and females of any caste continue to come in turn
 anda-seven-kaal main maadaa kaa dhyaan andey sene main kuch aisa lag jaataa he or usamen aisi ekaagratha utpann ho jaati he ki yadi koi uske andey ko hataakar anya koi vastu, jaise pathar ke tukade, rode ityadi, bhi rakh de to vah bina dekhe sune unpar baithkar unhen seti rahegi
 It is often seen that even after the eggs are spoiled or lifeless, the female keeps on incubating them for a long period
 kabutaron main nar bade chaav se anda seta he he
 Not only this, but the female removes herself and sits on the eggs
 nar swayan nahin de saktaa, kintu santanprem kii abhilaashaa se vah kisi tarah maadaa ko rijhaakar joda band letaa he, maadaa se andey dilava letaa he or phir uske baad unke sene tathaa shishupaalan kii sari kriya swayan bade chaav se sampann karata he

 Then in this, females, usually 20 to 30, lay eggs
 shaturamurg kii ek hi maadaa nahin hoti, ek nar kii kai patniyaan hoti hai or ye sabhi baari se isamen andey parti jaati hai
 After the laying of the eggs is complete, a small layer of sand is laid on them

 In the night, these birds sit on them and provide warmth to them
 kai pakshi aise hai, jo kisi ushn jal ke jharne ke sameep gadhe banaakar unamem andey dete hai, phir unhen dhakkar anyatra chale jate hai
 These eggs keep warm with the hot water of the spring
 samay puraa hone ke din ye lautakar aate hai or upar kii mitti ko hataa dete hai, phir bachche andey phodkar baahar chale aate hai
 Where there is extreme heat, the birds arrange to keep the eggs cold, not warm
 iske liye ve jal main apni chonch bhigo bhigokar unase andon ko bhigote rahete hai, taaki atyadhik taap ke kaaran unhen kshati na pahunche
 Seven times are also different among sparrows

 cannot open their eyes for several days
 ve ek nirih si avasthaa main pade rahete he tathaa hafton tak dhonsle main hi apane shishav ke din bitaate hai
 The first few weeks of the baby bird when coming out of the egg have some special difficulties and dangers

 Infants of different species of birds are born in different conditions and on this basis they can be classified into the following two major categories: nidatyagi shishu kii ankhen janm se hi khuli hoti hai or inkaa sharir mulaayam paron se dhakaa hota he
 They are alert and playful from the beginning and can run or swim
 haan, yadi inhen chhedaa na jaay to janm ke pashchaat kuch ghanton tak ye shant pade rahanaa pasand karenge

 The bird with which eggs hatch, also nurtures and protects their offspring with the same readiness
 santanraksha main bahudhaa dekha gaya he ki pakshi apane praan kii bhi chintaa nahin karte
 By making various excuses in child protection, these birds also surprise the visitor
 bahudhaa ye use dekhakar is prakaar langadaane lagate hai, maano kisi shikari dwaara ghayal kar die gaye hon
 Enemy hunters, Badikhas, Schwans, Shrigaladi, when they chase them with the hope of catching them, they go out of their way by dodging and then fly away suddenly

 Sparrows are also very aware of throwing dust in the eyes of others

 If a separate election is accepted for the untouchables, then i will stake my life against it
 " gandhi ji ko vishwaas tha ki pruthak nirvachan maan lene se hindu samaaj ke do tukade ho jaayenge or uskaa yah angabhang loktantr tathaa rashtriya ekta ke liye bada ghaatak siddh hoga or asprishyata ko maanakar savarna hinduon ne jo paap kiya he uskaa praayshchitt karne kaa avasar unke haath se chalaa jayega

 The Poona Pact secured a total of 148 seats in the Legislative Assemblies of Madras, Bombay Punjab, Bihar and Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Bengal and United Provinces under British India for the Dalit sections, while assuming the joint electoral system, while the Prime Minister's decisions Only 71 seats were given in the Lok Sabha, and 18 percent seats in the Central Legislative Assembly were reserved in the said tract

 a council of representatives of Hindus from all over India held in Bombay on September 25, 1932 under the chairmanship of Pt
 Madan Mohan Malaviya, passed a resolution of which the main part is - From today onwards any person among Hindus is "untouchable" "will not be considered and those who have been considered untouchable till now, will be able to use public wells, roads and all other institutions in the same way as others
 Shall do
 avasar milte hi, sabase pehle is adhikaar ke bare main kanoon bana diya jayega or yadi swatantraaa praapt hone se pehle aisa kanoon na banaaya gaya to swarajya sansad pehla kanoon isi ke bare main banaaegi
 On 26 September Gandhiji ended his fast with orange juice in the presence of poet Rabindranath Thakur and other friends
 is avasar par bhavavihval kavi thakur ne swarchit "jivan jakhan shukaye jaay, karunaa dharai esho" yah geet gaaya
 In the statement that Gandhiji gave for publication, ending the hunger, he expressed the hope that, "now not only mine, but the responsibility of hundreds of thousands of social reformers has increased so much that till the abolition of untouchability, this stigma Hinduism is not liberated from us, till then one cannot sit in peace
 yah na maan liya jaae ki sankat tal gaya
 The days of true test are coming now
 " After this, in the public meeting held in Bombay again on 30 September under the chairmanship of Pandit Malaviya ji, the Hindu leaders of the entire country decided to set up an all-india anti-untouchable board with its head office in Delhi for the purpose of untouchability
 And its branches in different provinces and to fulfill the above objective this program should be taken up - all the time Public wells, dharamshalas, roads, schools, crematoriums, etc
 should be declared open to the Dalit sections, public temples should be opened for them, provided that coercion is not resorted to in relation to others, but only to calmly persuade
 Be taken
 "" According to these determinations, an all-india institution named "anti-untouchability-mandal", later renamed "harijansevak-sangh", was formed
 sangh kaa mul samvidhan gandhi ji ne swayan taiyaar kiya
 The basic objective that harijan-sevak-sangh put in its constitution is- "the purpose of the Sangh is to eradicate untouchability in the Hindusam by truthful and non-violent means and to root out the other evils and disabilities arising out of it, the so-called untouchables
 Those, hereafter referred to as "harijans", have to suffer in all walks of life and thus at the same level as the rest of the Hindus
 Have to give
 " "to accomplish this objective, the harijan-sevak-sangh will endeavor to establish contact with the upper-caste Hindus across India and convince them that untouchability prevalent in Hindu society is totally against the core principles of Hinduism and the highest feelings of humanity, and The Sangh will also serve the moral, social and material welfare of the Harijans
 "" Shri Ghanshyamdas Birla, the first President of harijan-sevak-sangh was appointed and the post of Minister was held by Shri Amritlal Vitthaldas Thakkar, who was known as "thakkar Bapa"
 shrithakkar ne saare praanton ke pramukh samajasudharkon evam lokvetaaon se milakar kuch hi maheenon main sangh ko purnataya sangathit kar diya
 Gandhi ji published three weekly letters from inside the jail with a view to making the Harijan movement broad and active - "harijan" in English, "harijan Sevak" in Hindi and "harijan Bandhu" in Gujarati
 in saptahik patron ne kuch hi dinon main "yang india" or "navajivan" kaa sthaan le liya, jinka prakaashan raajnneetik kaarnon se band ho gaya tha
 In addition to the Harijan question, Gandhi used to write articles and comments in these papers on other topical subjects
 kuch dinon baad, thakkar bapa ke anurodh par asprishyatanivaranarth gandhi ji ne saare bharat kaa daura kiya
 Millions of people heard Gandhiji's speeches, thousands left untouchability and embraced the Harijans
 kahin kahin par kuch virdohi pradarshan bhi hue
 But Gandhiji won the hearts of the opponents with love
 is daure main harijankaarya ke liye jo nidhi ikatthi hui, vah das lakh rupye se upar hi thi
 Harijans instilled the courage to get their birthright
 savarnon kaa virodh bhi dhire dhire kam hone laga
 Gandhiji started to get the word of the people that "hinduism cannot survive destruction if untouchability persists
" " harijan-sevak-sangh ran thousands of schools and hundreds of hostels for Harijan-student students all over India
 udyogshalas bhi sthapit kin
 Scholarships and other assistance were also given to a large number of students
 harijanon kii bastiyon main aavashyaktaa ko dekhte hue anek kuen banawaye

 As soon as the country became independent, the Constitutional Council, which made the constitution under the prominence of Dr
 Ambedkar, declared untouchability "prohibited"
 kuch samay ke uparaant bhartiya sansad ne asprishyata aparaadh kanoon bhi bana diya
 The Government of India made several notable efforts in the direction of education and miscellaneous welfare work of Harijans by appointing Special Commissioner for Scheduled Castes
 sansad or rajyon kii vidhaan sabhaaon main surakshit sthanon se jo harijan chune gaye, unamem se anek suyogy vyaktiyon ko centre main evam vibhinn rajyon main mantriyon ke uttardaayitvapurn pad die gaye

 The economic situation also improved considerably

 The Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost have the same meaning
 20veen sadi se pehle angreji main holi spirit ke liye holi ghost bahut hi aam naam tha
 The name is used in the Book of Common Prayer, Catholic Doug Reims Bible and King James Version) and is still widely used among English speakers whose religious vocabulary is largely derived from the KJV
 yah shabd aaj bhi angrezi carch main paaramparik-bhashaa ke sanskaar main barkaraar he
 The original meaning of the English word ghost is parallel to spirit or soul; Later, the latter word was taken in the specific meaning of "the dead soul of the dead" and added to the objectionable symbolic meaning

 Christians believe that the Holy Spirit gives 'gifts' to Christians
 vishisht kshamtaaon vaale ye uphaar isai vyaktiyon ko pradaan kiye jate hai
 They are known by the Greek word for gift, charisma, which makes the word charismatic
 nayaa vidhaan teen alag-alag aise uphaar pradaan karata he, jo ki alokik se lekar vishisht aahvaan se sambhddha se lekar harek isai se apekshit kuch had tak tak shreneebaddh hote he
 It is mostly believed that these lists are not exhaustive and others prepare their own lists

 sammati kii aatma; 4
 kshamta kii aatma; 5
 gyaan kii aatma; 6
 dharmikata kii aatma; 7
 pavitra bhay kii aatma
 The greatest disagreement remains among Christians about the existence of the Holy Spirit, regarding the nature and occurrence of these gifts, especially supernatural gifts
 ek raay yah he ki isai dharmadutiya yugon ke liye alokik tohfon ke vitaran kii vishesh vyavastha hua karti thi, kyonki us samay girjaghar kii sthiti anokhi thi or vartmaan samay main pradaan kiya janaa durlabh ho gaya he
 This view is that of Catholic churches and other mainstream Christian groups

 However, the practice of supernatural gifts was rare in some small groups such as the Montinists until the development of the Pentecostal movement in the late 19th century
 alokik uphaar kii praasangikta main aastik kabhi-kabhi pavitra aatma ke baptism yaa pavitra aatma ke poorak ke bare main kaha karte hai, jisaki un uphaaron ko praapt karne ke kram main isai ko anubhav karne kii jarurat he

 From the point of view of theology, these symbols are the key to understanding the Holy Spirit and his works and it is not only artistic representation

 purvi orthodoxi kaa daawa he ki parampita devatv kaa shaashvat strot he, jisase putr shaashvat rup se paidaa hota he
 In contrast to the Roman Catholic Church and Western Christianity in general, the traditional church did not accept the use of the Filioque, describing the grace of the Holy Spirit
 589 main third council of tolado main pehali baar philiok kaa jik kiya gaya or 11veen sadi main roman catholic girjaghar dwaara moolmantra main ise joda gaya
 It is believed for the Holy Spirit to originate from the Father in perpetuity, according to Jesus in John 15:26; Not from the Father and the Son, as the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches claim

 During the last phase of the 19th century, the extradition movement prevailed the view that the Holy Spirit currently functions only through the influence of inspired theology
 is tarkwaadi vichaardhaara ko elexander campbell se joda gaya, jo "bhavatmak shivi baithkon or unke din ke pratyarvatan ke rup main jo unhone dekha, usase bahut adhik prabhavit" the
 They believe that the soul leads people to salvation, but it is understood that the soul does this work "by the persuasion and thought of words in the same way in which one person moves from one to the other
" " yah vichaar barton dablyoo stone par abhibhavi hua, jinka maananaa he ki isai ke jivan par aatma kii adhik pratyaksh bhoomika hoti he
 From the 20th century, there were many from the Church of Christ who broke away from the "word-only" doctrine of the operation of this Holy Spirit
 jaisaa ki andolan ke ek chaatr kaa kahana he, "achche yaa bure ke liye ho, jin logon ne tathakthith shabd keval siddhant kii himaayat kii thi unki pakad isamsih ke girjagharon ke logon ke mano-mastishk par ab nahin rahi

" While the Holy Spirit has been accepted as God in all mainstream denominations, it has a special emphasis in Pentecostal churches
 un charchon main aadhunik isaayiyon ko loukik tathaa alokik uphaar, jaise ki vaani tathaa bhavishyavaanee karne kii shakti, dene vaale ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The Christian movement called Pentecostalism derives its name from the event of Pentecost, the event of the coming of the Holy Spirit when Jesus' disciples gathered in Jerusalem
 pentacostwadiyon kaa maananaa he ki jab kisi vishwasi kaa "pavitra aatma se baptism" hota he, tab aatma ke uphaar isamsih ke sharir arthath carch ko unnat karne ke liye praptakarta main sakriy ho jate hai
 Some of these gifts are listed in 1 Corinthians 12
 pentacostal andolan pavitra aatma ke kaam par vishesh bal detaa he or vishesh rup un uphaaron par jinka ullekh upar kiya gaya he, unka vishwaas he ki aaj bhi uphaar die ja rahe hai
 Most of Pentecostalism differentiates "baptism with the Holy Spirit" from the experience of re-birth, it is generally a different experience in which it is believed to gain the power of the soul by the Christian in a new way
 With that, Christians will be able to display symbols, miracles and wonders more readily for the sake of evangelism or for service within the church and community
 Some Pentecostalists believe that soul baptism is an essential element for salvation, not a "second blessing"
 These Pentecostalists believe that the power of the soul is released in their lives when they are baptized by the Holy Spirit
 kai pentacostalwaadi maanate hai ki pavitra aatma ke is antavpuran kaa nirdeshaatmak praarambhik sakshya he anya jabaanon main bol paane kii kshamta ),or kisi vyakti vishesh vishwasi ke jivan main pavitra aatma kii upasthiti ke anek aadhyatmik abhivyaktiyon main se ek he vaani kii abhivyakti
 Non-trinitarian views differ significantly from traditional Christian doctrine and generally fall into two categories
 kuch samoohon kaa maananaa he ki pavitra aatma parameshwar pita or parameshwar putr se ek alag satta he or kisi anya myne main koi alag astitv hone ke bajaay vah unke saath 'ek' he; latter de santon kaa vishwaas is shrenee main aata he
 Others believe that some aspect or function of God refers to the Holy Spirit; Jehovaz Wittnes, Christadelphians, Unity Church and Oneness Pentecostalism beliefs fall into this category
 latter de saint andolan main, pavitra pretatma ko ishwariyamurti kaa teesraa bhinn sadsy manaa jaataa he, or uske paas ek "aatma" rupi sharir hota he, jo ki use pita or putr se alag karata he jinke paas jaisaa ki kaha jaataa he "manushya kii tarah moort" sharir hote hai
 Like other modalist groups, Oneness Pentecostalism states that the Holy Spirit is a form of God, rather than separate or distinct from the Father, it is simply another name of the Father and not the distinction between God the Father, his Son and the Holy Spirit is
 jehova ke gavaah kaa maananaa he ki pavitra aatma asli maanav nahin he, balki parameshwar kii shakti he, jaise ki parameshwar kii divya "saanse" yaa "urja", jiskaa istemaal unki ichha ko puraa karne or srijan, mukti, pavitrataa ou divya maargdarshan ke uddeshy main hota he or ve is shabd kaa saamaanya taur par laabh nahin uthaate

 The Unity Church describes the spiritual terms God the Father, God and the Holy Spirit in a spiritual way in three forms of intellectual activity: intelligence, imagination and expression

 The concept of Bahá'í religion is of the greatest soul, seen as the limit of God
 iskaa istemaal aamtaur par parameshwar ke doot / paigambar ke upar parameshwar kii aatma ke avataran kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ki parameshwar ke aavirbhaav ke rup main janaa jaataa he, tathaa inamen isamsih, mohammad or bahoulla shaamil hai
 In Bahá'í it is believed that the Holy Spirit is the carrier through which the knowledge of God is directly connected with His messenger and in different religions, in different ways such as the burning of Moses' bush, which is the sacred fire for the Zoroastrians, The pigeon near Jesus, the angel Gabriel of Muhammad and the nymph of heaven near Baha'u'llah
 bahaai dharm is avadharana ko khaarij kar detaa he ki devatv main pavitra aatma parameshwar kaa saajhedaar he, balki maanata he ki vishuddh saar parameshwar kii visheshta he
 In the religion of Islam, a spirit created as a messenger who performs a divine act or gives a message is usually seen in association with the angel Gabriel or Ruhul Qudus and is called the Holy Spirit, but alternatively created by God The soul with which he killed Adam, is inspired by the angel of the heaven and the Prophet

 However, the term Ruhul Qudus is found in the Talmud or Midrasi literature

 The "holy Spirit" is humanized to some extent in the Rabbi, but it is the quality of God as one of his attributes; Not as a spiritual division of the representative into divinity, as in Christianity
 shekhinah bhi dekhen
 a religious movement developed out of Christianity, called Rastafari, it makes its own unique interpretation of the Holy Trinity and the Holy Spirit
 haalanki bahut saare maamuli badlaav he, ye aamtaur par yah kehete hai ki yah haile selasi he, jo param pita parameshwar or parameshwar donon ko moort kar detaa he; jabaki holi yani pavitra aatma rastaa dharm main vishwaas karanevaalon main) or har maanav jati main paaya jaataa he
 Rasta also says that the human body is the true church and also that the Holy Spirit resides in this church
 jordan main jab isamsih kaa bapstima hota he tab pavitra aatma un par ek kabutar ke rup main utarati hai; is vivaran ke aadhaar par pavitra aatma ko hameshaa kabutar ke rup main darshaya gaya he
 Many pictures of the proclamation show the Holy Spirit as a dove, as soon as the archangel Gabriel declares that Jesus Christ is coming into Mary's womb, a light rays begin to grow towards Mary
 ek kabutar mahaan sant gregory ke kaan main bhi dekha ja saktaa he jaisaa ki anya girjagharon ke fadar lekhakon yaa unke sachivon dwaara unke kiye gaye kaamon ke die gaye varnan main darj he
 The dove is also parallel to that, which comes with the olive branch to Noah after the flood, and the presence of God in the Rabi tradition above the surface of the pigeon
 da book of acts ne hawa ke rup main paintecost main parameshwar ke doot ke upar utarate hue pavitra aatma kaa varnan kiya he or laplapaati hui agni ko parameshwar ke doot ke upar vishram karte hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Based on the imagination, the Holy Spirit is sometimes depicted as a symbol of the fire crest in this description

 Furthermore, the divine presence of God is in Shekhinah and is also feminine

 The word Holy Spirit has been translated into Arabic language القدس الروح and has been used as a masculine in all Qurans

 The author reiterates that God is spirit and that the Bible introduces God through humanization and avatarism, which only shows the likeness of God
 God is not a sexual being, either male or female─something that was considered to be true in ancient Near Eastern religion
 He even speaks specifically against such a view in Num 23:19, where the text has God saying he is not a man, and in Deut 4:15-16, in which he warns against creating a graven image of himself in "the likeness of male and female
" But though he is not a male, the "formless" deity has chosen to reveal himself largely in masculine ways
 In art, when the Holy Spirit is introduced using the form of a human body, that form is usually that of the male body, such physical characteristics are not meant to represent reality

 Use of seedlings in places where water is available in sufficient quantity, use dhaincha in areas with drought conditions and in problematic lands such as alkaline conditions
 guar ko kam varsha vaale sthanon main retili, kam upjau bhoomi main lagaayen
