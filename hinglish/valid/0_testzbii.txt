 The decision to partition Bengal was announced on 19 July 1905 by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India

 The partition took effect from 16 October 1905

 It was a part of the British "divide - rule" policy

 main sampoorn desh main `bang-bhang' aandolan shuru ho gaya
 The eastern and western parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911 due to pressure from the Indian people on both sides due to high level political unrest caused by this division
 bengal praant kaa kshetrafal 489,500 varg kilometre or jansankhya 8 karod se zyada thi
 East Bengal was geographically and almost isolated from West Bengal due to less communication means
 1836 main, upree praanton ko ek leftinent governor ke shashan ke antargat kar diya gaya or 1854 main governor general-in-council ko bengal ke pratyaksh prashasan se mukt kar diya gaya
 Assam was separated from Bengal, including Sylhet, in 1874 to form a separate chief-commissioner, and later in 1898 Lushai Hills was also included
 bengal jaise bade or itani adhik aabaadi vaale praant kaa prabandhan bahut kathin tha
 The partition of Bengal was first thought in 1903
 chittagong tathaa dhaka or maimansingh ke jilon ko bengal se alag kar assam praant main milaane ke atirikt prastaav bhi rakhe gaye the
 Similarly, Chota Nagpur was also to be merged with the Central Province
 san 1903 main hi congress kaa bhi 19vaan adhiveshan madras main hua tha
 On the same occasion, its Chairman Mr
 Lalmohan Ghosh, in his address criticized the reactionary policy of the government, reported impending disorganization on an all-india platform
 unhone kaha ki is prakaar kaa ek shadyantr chal rahaa he
 The government officially published the idea in January of 1904 and in February Lord Curzon made official visits to assess the public opinion on the partition in the eastern districts of Bengal
 unhone pramukh hastiyon ke saath paraamarsh kiya or dhaka, chatgaanv tathaa maimansingh main bhaashan dekar vibhaajan par sarkaar ke rukh ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Henry John Stedman Cotton, who was Chief Commissioner of Assam from 1896 to 1902, opposed the idea
 congress ke agle adhiveshan main sabhapati pad se bolte hue sar henry coton ne bhi yah kaha ki yadi yah bahaanaa he ki itane bade praant ko ek rajyapal sanbhaal nahin saktaa to yaa to bombai or madras kii tarah bengal kaa shashansutra saprishad rajyapal ke sipurd ho yaa banglaa bhashiyon ko alag karke ek praant banaaya jaae
 In those days Bengal province also included Bihar and Orissa
 par british sarkaar ne na to congress kii parvaah kii, na janamat kii
 The then Viceroy and Governor General Lord Curzon tried to convince the people in the Land Holders Association or Zamindar Sabha that vangabhang would only benefit
 vah swayan purv bengal main bhi gaye, par mutthi bhar musalamaanon ke atirikt kisi ne is prastaav kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 The then Nawab of Dhaka, reputed among the Muslims, also opposed it in the first charge
 1905 main 16 oktober ko bharat ke tatkaaleen waisarai lard karjan dwaara bengal kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya
 The division was encouraged for administrative tasks, Bengal being almost as large as France, with a population much larger than France
 aisa sochaa gaya ki purvi kshetra upekshit or uchit rup se shasit nahin tha
 With the division of the province, better administration could be established in the eastern region, so that the people there would ultimately benefit from school and employment opportunities
 haalaanki, vibhaajan kii yojana ke peeche anya uddeshy bhi chhipe the
 Bengali Hindus were pioneers in the political movement for greater participation in governance, so now their position was weakened due to the increase in the dominance of the Muslims in the past
 Both Hindus and Muslims opposed the partition
 After partition, however, an almost anti-british movement prevailed at the national level, including non-violent and violent protests, boycotts and even the assassination of the governor of the new province of West Bengal
 prabal saarvajanik virodh ke baavjood 20 july 1905 ko vangbhang ke prastaav par bharat sachiv kaa thappa lag gaya
 The Rajshahi, Dhaka and Chittagong Commissioners were merged with Assam to form a province, which was named as Poorvang and Assam, and the rest, ie Presidency and Vardhaman Commissioners, Bihar, Udha and some base

 The Nawab of Dhaka had earlier protested, but he became in his favor when he became disenchanted
 sar jojeff bamfield fuller purvavang or assam ke nae leftinant governor bane
 He is said to have said openly in many places that Hindus and Muslims are his two bibis, of which Muslims are his favorites
 is kathan kaa aashay spasht tha
 Vangabhang was not intended to facilitate administration, as it was claimed, but rather had two clear objectives, one to fight a Hindu Muslim and the other to hurt the newly awakened Bengal
 yadi gaharaai se dekha jaae to yaheen se pakistan kaa bijaropan hua
 One of the resolutions passed in the 1906 session of the Muslim League was also that vangabhang is good for Muslims and those who agitate against it do wrong things and they harm Muslims
 baad ko chalakar lig ke 1908 ke adhiveshan main bhi yah prastaav paarit hua ki congress ne vangbhang ke virodh kaa jo prastaav rakhaa he, vah sweekruti ke yogya nahin

 iskaa kshetrafal 106,540 varg mile tha or jansankhya teen karod das lakh thi, jisame ek karod assi lakh muslim or ek karod bees lakh hindu the
 There was a Legislative Council and a two-member Revenue Board for administration and the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court was not changed

 The Government of India publicized its final decision with the accepted resolution of 19 July 1905 and the partition of Bengal came into force from 16 October of the same year
 1911 main radd kiye jane se purv, vibhaajan bamushkil aadhe dashak tak chal paaya tha
 However, the UK policy behind Partition was Divide et Impera, which continued to influence the reorganized province

 Prior to this, many members of both communities advocated national unity for all Bengalis

 There was bloodshed in both the divisions of Bengal

 Muslims in East Bengal believed that a separate region would provide them more opportunities for education, employment, etc
, whereas the people of West Bengal did not like this partition and a large amount of nationalist literature was produced during this time

 The battle took place between a small group of supporters and relatives of Prophet Muhammad's Nawaz Hazrat Imam Hussein ibn Ali and a large military detachment of the Umayyad tyrannical Yazid I

 It is not only a battle but also a guide to all aspects of life

 Imam Ali a became the Khalifa Some unrighteous people did not like, so many battles took place, Ali a was martyred, then after him Hazrat Imam Hassan ibn Ali a Khalifa was also martyred
 us samay kaa bana hua shaasha yajid mana jaataa hai ki dusht or atyachari tha or apni hukumat main gaiyr islamic kaam kiya karata tha, iraq or kufa ke logo ne hazrat imam hossain ko kai khat likh kar kufa aane ko kaha taaki wo unke haathon main bait kar kar ke unhen apana khalipha banaaye lekin yajid chahta tha ki hossain uske saath ho jaaen, vah jaanata tha agar hossain uske saath aa gaye to sara islam uski mutthi main hoga
 Even after a lot of pressure, Hussain refused to accept any of his things, so Yajid planned to stop Hussain
 chaar may, 680 i
 main imam hossain madeene main apana ghar chhodkar shahar makke pahunche, jahaan unka haj karne kaa iraadaa tha lekin unhen pataa chalaa ki dushman hajiyon ke bhesh main aakar unka katl kar sakate hai
 Hussein did not want to bleed in a holy place like Kaaba, then Imam Hussein changed the intention of Hajj and proceeded towards Kufa
 raste main dushmano kii fouj unhen gher kar karbala le ai
 The land on which Imam Hussain set up his camp in Karbala was first bought by Imam Hussain, and then put up his camp at that place
 yajid apane saradaaron ke dwaara lagaataar imam hossain par dabaav banaata gaya ki hossain uski baat maan len, jab imam hossain ne yajid kii sharten nahin maani, to dushmano ne ant main nahar par fouj kaa paharaa laga diya or hossain ke khemon main pani jane par roak laga di gai
 Seeing the army of Yazid, the people of Kufa Iraq who had called Imam Hussein to make their Khalifa also left
 teen din guzar jane ke baad jab imam ke parivaar ke bachche pyaas se tadapane lage to hossain ne yajidi fouj se pani maanga, dushman ne pani dene se inkaar kar diya, dushmano ne sochaa imam hossain pyaas se tut jaaenge or hamaari sari sharten maan lenge
 When Hussain did not listen to Yajid even after three days of thirst, the enemies started attacking Hussain's camps

 On October 10, 680 AD, the battle broke out since the time of Namaz, it would not be right to say that because there was an army of lakhs on the one hand, on the other side there was a family of 72 members and a few men among them, but historians write Jung
 vaise imam hossain ke saath keval 75 yaa 80 mard the, jisamen 6 maheene se lekar 13 saal tak ke bachche bhi shaamil the
 72 people were martyred in Karbala to protect the foundations of Islam, in which enemies shot a three-pointed arrow on the neck of six-month-old child Ali Asghar, 13-year-old Hazrat Qasim was trampled by livestock and seven years eight The child of the month was martyred on the head of aun-mohammed with a sword
