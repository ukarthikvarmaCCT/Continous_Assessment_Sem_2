 In the Charkha Samiti building located at Kadam Kuan in Patna, where JP lived, big leaders of the Janata Party were gathered from all over the country
 Those leaders included Chandrashekhar, Nanaji Deshmukh
 Despite being held as Chief Minister, Kurtas, torn slippers and shattered hair were the hallmarks of Karpoori Thakur
 Seeing his condition, a leader remarked, 'how much salary for a chief minister to live properly should meet?' Everyone understood the implications
 Laughed
 Then Chandrasekhar got up from his seat
 He grabbed his long kurta with his two hands and spread it towards the front
 He alternately went to the leaders sitting there and said that you donate to Karpoori ji's kurta fund
 Immediately a few hundred rupees were collected
 After covering it, Chandrasekhar ji gave Karpoori ji and told him to buy his kurta-dhoti only
 Do not do any other work

 On such occasions, he could hardly speak, but all those who could not speak could see in his eyes clearly

 It happened that the Congress came to power with the independence
 bihar main congress par oonchi jatiyon kaa kabja tha
 These upper castes started fighting amongst themselves to taste more and more of power

 After the first general elections of 1952, a number of backward castes within the Congress also formed a separate group, named 'triveni Sangh'
 ab yah sangh bhi us mahanatak main sammilit ho gaya
 Soon its bad results began to appear
 sankhyabal, baahubal or dhanabal kii kaali takatein raajnneeti or samaaj ko niyantrit karne lageen
 The nature of political parties started changing
 nishthavan kaaryakarta aundhe munh girane lage
 Karpoori ji not only faced this situation firmly, but also fiercely exposed these tendencies

 hua yah tha ki 1977 ke chunaav main pehali baar raajnneetik satta par pichhadaa varg ko nirnaayak badhat hasil hui thi
 But he did not have control over the administration
 isliye sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan kii maang jor-shor se kii jane lagi
 Karpoori ji, as the Chief Minister, set a formula for the above demand as constitutionally agreed and after much deliberation, it was also implemented
 is par paksh or vipaksh main thodaa bahut ho-hallaa bhi hua
 Different groups also accused each other of being racist
 magar karpuri ji kaa vyaktitv niraapad rahaa
 His stature grew even higher

 He also understood the political moves of the Congress party in politics and the ambitions of the leaders of the socialist camp

 donon main 11-11 sarg hai is granth ke ant main yah nirdisht nahin he ki 'granth samaapt hua' - is kaaran sanshay hota he ki yah granth apurna he
 This poem is difficult because it has been said - Naishadh Vidyadoshdham alankrita kavyrachana style kii pradhantavaale maghottarayugi kaviyon dwaara nirmit kaavyon main alankaran pradhanta, praudhokti kalpana se prerit varnan pransgon kii sphitata tathaa paandityalabdh gyanagarishthata atisangyojan aadi kii pravriti badi
 The full climax of that interest can be seen in Sriharsha's medical chart

 In the Naishdha, the classical vaishutya and the great flight of imagination, Adyant is seen
 is mahakavy kaa mul aadhaar he "mahabharat" kaa "nalopakhyaan"
 Necessary changes in the original form of the original story have also been done here and there

 For this reason, the poet also took some elements from there
 yah mahakavy aadyant shringaari he
 Purvarag, Viraha, Swan's cremation, Swayambara, nal-damayanti-vivah, the couple's first encounter and the Ashtayamacharya and the Khandavagic narrative of Sanyogavilas have been greatly magnified by the poet's narrators and imaginative Vaidyavilas

 Nature of nature, pathology, metaphor, metaphor, inspirational exaggeration, contrast, syllogism etc
 The ability to use semantics, alliterative, glossary, empowered use of miraculous miracles, and the amazing ability to use the appropriation of dictionaries, poignant, mature and expedient planning of classical aspects, imaginations and Proper insertion of images, first-mogul This poetry has been getting unprecedented respect in Sanskrit pandimandali till date due to its spontaneous emergence of lustful marking, embellishments and ornamental poetic style of adornment and miracle
 magh kavi se bhi adhik sriharsh ne ise kavyabadhak paandityapradarshan ke yoga se bahut badha diya he jisase laghukthanakwala kavy ati vrihat ho gaya he
 Being insensitive in marking the skills of Shringari villas and chiefly Kailas and the luxuries of Rasik Nagars, the poet's philosophical generosity increased poetic place in poetry
 punarukti, chyutsamskruti aadi anek dosha bhi yatra tatra dhunde ja sakate hai
 But even after his stay, the artist's amazing talent has shone in the epic due to his grandeur and sublime, imaginativeness and generosity, pedagogy and euphoria, even when ornamented, there is a spontaneous luxury in his play

 The study of the three epics of Brihattrayi is still considered essential for the Pandits

 Shyam Narayan Pandey ji composed four excellent epics, of which Haldighati became the most popular and Jauhar became the most famous
 haldighati main vir shiromani maharana pratap ke jivan or johar main chittor kii rani padmini ke aakhyaan hai
 He had received the Dev Award for the best honor of that time on the Haldighati epic written in the popular name of this historic heroic land of Rajasthan, known as Haldighati

 He wrote this epic for the purpose of portraying the heroic character of Padmini, the queen of Chittor
 
 An example of Shyam Narayan Pandey's Veer Ras style from his famous Khandakavya Jai hanuman- bijganit bhi dekhen
 a branch of algebra mathematics in which symbols are used instead of numbers
 bijganit char tathaa achar raashiyon ke sameekaran ko hal karne tathaa char raashiyon ke maan nikaalane par aadhaarit he
 The development of algebra resulted in the development of coordinate geometry and calculus, which greatly increased the usefulness of mathematics
 isse vigyaan or takneekee ke vikaas ko gati mili
 The great mathematician Bhaskaracharya II has said - arthath mandabuddhi ke log vyakti ganit kii sahaayta se jo prashn hal nahin kar pate hai, ve prashn avyakt ganit kii sahaayta se hal kar sakate hai
 In other words, algebra simplifies the solution to difficult problems of arithmetic
 bijganit se saadharantah taatpary us vigyaan se hota he, jisamen sankhyaon ko aksharon dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he
 But the operation marks remain the same, used in arithmetic
 maan len ki hamen likhnaa he ki kisi aayat kaa kshetrafal uski lambaai tathaa chaudaai ke gunanfal ke samaan hota he to ham is tathy ko niman prakaar nirupit karenge— The development of the modern notation of algebra began a few centuries ago; But the problem of means of equations is very old
 isa se 2000 varsh purv log atkal lagaakar samikarnon ko hal karte the
 By 300 years before Christ, our ancestors started writing equations in words and knew their solutions by geometry method
 aaj bijganit main keval samikarnon kaa hi samavesh nahin hota, isamen bahupad, satat bhinn, anant gunanfal, sankhya anukram, rup, saaranik, shrenik aadi anek prakarnon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Algebra can often be divided into the following categories - bijganit ke jis prakaran main anirnit samikarnon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, uskaa purana naam 'kuttak' he
 The Hindu mathematician Brahmagupta named this science 'kuttaka Mathematics' in 628 AD, after the same case
 bijganit kaa sabase pracheen naam yahi he
 In 860 AD, Prithmuk Swami named it 'algebra'
 ‘beej’ kaa arth he ‘tatva’
 Hence the name 'algebra' means 'the science in which elements are computed'
 ankaganit main samast sanketon kaa maan vidit rahata he
 In algebra, broad signals are used, whose value is initially unknown
 isliye in donon vigyaanon ke anya pracheen naam vyakt ganit or avyakt ganit bhi hai
 Algebra in English is called 'algebra'
 yah naam arab desh se aayaa he
 In 825 AD, the Arab mathematician 'al Khwarizmi' wrote a book of mathematics, called 'al-jabr-val-muqam'
 arabi main ‘al-jabr’ or farsi main ‘muqabla’ sameekaran ko hi kehete hai
 Therefore, the author probably named the book 'al-jabr-val-muqam' after taking the necessary names of 'equations' in Arabic and Persian languages
 unani ganit ke svarnim yug main aljabra kaa aadhunik arth main namonishaan tak nahin tha
 The Greeks had the ability to solve many difficult questions of algebra, but all their solutions were geometric

 have been given a wide range of topics

 Longinus is traditionally believed to be the creator of a work called "sublime element in poetry"
 is kriti main achche lekhan ke prabhaavon kii charchaa he
 The real name of Longinus is not known
 vah unani kavyalochan kaa shikshak tha
 Its period is estimated to be from the first to the third century
 lonzinus ne kavy ko shreshth banane vaale tatwon par vichaar karte hue is siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 He considers the sublime as the element that makes poetry better and the poet the prestige
 yah udaatt mahaan vichaaron sangathit alankaar yojana, abhijatya pad rachana tathaa prabhaav kii garima main nihit he
 They consider Vagadambara Baleta and Bhavadambara as obstructing elements
 jis prakaar bhartiya kavyashastra main kavy ke swaroop or uski aatma ko lekar vibhinn maton kaa pratipaadan hua he usee prakaar paashchaatya aalochana ke kshetra main vibhinn yugon main vibhinn chintakon ne kavy yaa sahitya ke mul tatva kii khoj kii he
 Plato considered simulation to be the core of literature
 inkaa pallavan arestu ne apni drushti se kiya or virechan ko sahitya kaa uddeshy sweekaar kiya
 Similarly, Longinus has a sublime theory
 is siddhanth ke dwaara unhone yah spasht kiya he ki koi bhi kalakriti yaa kavyakruti bina udaatt tatva ke shreshth rachana nahin ho sakati
 The best is the one who has deep thoughts and feelings of the Creator
 rachanaakaar kaa yah anubhuti tatva apni mahanata, udaattata, bhavyata yaa garima ke kaaran rachana ko mahaan banaata he
 Creation or creation gets expression through craft; But the author of the sublime work tries not to worry too much about the beauty of the craft in his creation, to strengthen the feeling contained in it
 is udaatt siddhanth ko prastut karanevaale acharya lonzinus he
 His Greek language name is Longinus and in English language is pronounced 'longinus'
 inaki rachana kaa naam ‘perihutsus’ he, jiskaa angreji main ‘on da sablim’ naam se anuwaad kiya gaya
 This is what is called the sublime in Hindi
 iskaa granth paashchaatya sahitya-shaastra kaa pramukh granth he
 Lonaginus's definition of the sublime and its general introduction as it appears that the term had become so prevalent in his time that he felt no need to give it a detailed introduction
 phir bhi udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karte hue unhone itnaa kaha- That is, the name of the distinctiveness and superiority of the expression is sublime
 isi ko lakshya karke hindi aalochakon ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki kisi rachana main udaatt tatva upyukt tathaa garimapurna shabd-vidhaan, aaveg ko deept karne vaali alankaar yojana tathaa rachana-vidhaan dwaara abhivyakt hota he
 Longinus described the sublime of poetry as distinct from speech, because in poetry the effect of sublime on the audience is in the form of subjectivity, not as enforcement
 is kaaran lonzinus kii drushti main bhavy kavita vahiin he jo anandatirek ke kaaran hamen itnaa nimagn or tanmay kar de ki ham aisi ucch bhav-bhoomi par pahunch jaae jahaan varnya vishay vidyut-prakaash kii bhanti aalokit ho uthta he
 From this point of view, Longinus can be seen to have a lot of equanimity in the thawed-vedhyantar of Anandatirek and Vishwanath
 udaatt ke swaroop ke antargat lonzinus main manovaigyanik or vyavhaarik donon drushtiyon ko saamne rakhaa
 This is why he has mentioned the internal elements of the sublime on one side and has also discussed its external side
 udaatt mul aadhaar kya he? kya vah vaktaa yaa lekhak kii janmajaat pratibha par aadhaarit hota he yaa uskaa prasphuton shiksha-diksha se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he yaa abhyaas par nirbhar he? in prashnon par vichaar karte hue lonzinus ne madhya maarg kaa anukaran kiya he
 Sublime to his view is neither genius relative to all nor relative to practice
 vastutah udaatt kaa aadhaar vyakti kaa koi ek paksh, ek gun yaa ek pravriti nahin he apitu uske peeche sampoorn vyaktitv kii jhalak hoti he
 Therefore, the creation of a sublime can be a sublime personality
 mahaan pratibhashali ucch vidwaan evam yashasvi charitravaan vyakti hi udaatt yaa udghoshak ho saktaa he
 According to Longinus - "sublime is a reflection of the greatness of the soul
" sachcha udaatt keval unheen main prapya he jinaki chetana udaatt evam vicasonmukh he
 It is quite natural that the words of those whose minds are full of lofty perceptions can be echoed by lofty words
 ’’ In this way, the sublime is concerned not only with the study of talent, study and language, but with the entire personality of the person
 nishkarshtah Its effect is not gradual, incidental and the narrative shines through its unique light
 yadhyapi udaatt ke muladhar sahityakar ke vyaktitv kii mahanata main nihit he phir bhi rachana main udaatt kaa tatva laane main liye lonzinus ne paanch sroton kii charchaa kii he- Out of the above five elements, the first two are part of the birthright ie poet-talent and the remaining three are art related features
 udaatt ke stroton main pratham sthaan vichaar kii mahatta kaa he
 This is what Loninus also called the grandeur of the soul by word
 unka spasht kathan he- ‘‘udaatt mahaan kii aatma kii pratidhwani hota he
 "if this importance of the soul is not natural then it can be achieved by excellent ideas
 mahaan shabd unheen ke mukh se nikalate hai jinamein vichaar gambheer or gahan hon
 Only rich writers with great ideas can create sublime
 lonzinus kii yah aisi avadharana he, jisase unki udaatt-prabhaav sambandhi dharna bhi judi hui hai
 The effect of the sublime is atrophy, not persuasion
 yah dharna is baat ko visheshikrut karti hai ki atmaati kraman bhavy or mahaan vichaaron kii garimamayi abhivyakti se hi sambhav he
 In fact, spiritual greatness is the first condition of sublime creation, that is why the effect of sublime will also be considered morally welfare
 is prakaar udaatt sahitya kaa prabhaav naitik tathaa kalatmak donon hi drushtiyon se uttam mana janaa chahie
 From this point of view, Longinus and Grandmother Milton descend on the same level
 milton ke anusaar mahaan sahityakar banane ke liye mahaan or ati sammanneey vastuon kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 Milton's view is- manasviyon ko yah bhavy vaani sahaj hi praapt ho jaati hai
 Sometimes it happens that the talented poet cools down like the sun setting in the evening of his life and the lack of sublime appears in his later poetry
 odisi main homer kii isi astachal-gamini pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 Longinus states - "elliot is Homer's creation of youthfulness, because it has the essence of motion and struggle
 iske vipareet, odissi kaa bahulansh aakhyanatmak hai, jo budhaape kii dein he
 "vishnu Priya" and "ratnavali" of Maithilisharan Gupta in Hindi are similar poems, in which the brilliance of their talent can be seen
 pant or bachchan kaa parvarti kavy bhi iskaa udhaaharan hai
 Longinus emphasizes the imperative of boisterous impulses in the artwork, as it is necessary for the work to be great to provide emotional stimulation to the readers
 bhavavesh yaa bhavy aaveg ve hen jinase ‘aatma’ apane aap upar uthne lagati hai or phir harshollas se bhar jaati hai
 Longinus has created two classes of impulses — one grand and the other inferior
 bhavy aavegon main ucch bhavavesh arthath utkrisht bhaavana prabalya, aadar, vismay, ullas or shaury aadi kii gananaa karte hai, jabaki nimna aavegon kaa sambandh karunaa, shok or bhay se he
 To fill the sublime in poetry, the eclipse of high emotion and low emotion should be discarded
 lonzinus kaa mat he ki alankaaron kaa prayog is kushalta se hona chahie ki is baat par kisi kaa dhyaan na jaae ki vah alankaar he
 When art is used skillfully, it loses its beauty and its configuration of miracles
 vastutah alankaar kii chamatkrit na karen, apitu vah anand hetuk hona chahie
 Longinus considered superlative ornaments to be sublime
 unke anusaar vistaarna, shapathokti, prashnalankar, viparyay, vyatikram, punrariti, pratyakshikaran, sanchay, saar, rup-parivartan, paryyokti, atishyokti aadi alankaaron main udaatt vidyaman rahata hai
 Therefore, it is necessary for the sublime to be spontaneous and justified
 udaahranarth Longineus by poetic expression means poetic language
 unhone bhashaa kii utkrushtataa par vishesh bal diya he; kyonki udaatt kii abhivyakti bhashaa ke madhyam se hoti he
 It is imperative to have a proper, appropriate effect and syllogism of the phrase, because by using energetic language, the creator can create a work that has a bad effect
 upyukt or prabhavi shabdaawalee ke dwaara rachana main bhavyata, garima, oj, madev, shakti aadi gunon kaa samavesh or jeevantata kaa sanchaar hota he
 Rachna-vidhan means symmetric word-plan or word plan in a certain order
 lonzinus ke anusaar vibhinn tattvon kaa parsparik saamanjasy kriti ko garimapurna banaata he
 Just as there is no importance for the different elements of the body to remain independent, the creation of the entire body is possible only when it is found, in the same way, the creation of a dignified work is done by the combination of all the elements
 rachana ke sabhi tatva milakar jab saamanjasy kii shrinkhalaa main bandh jate hai, tabhi un main udaatt aata he
 Otherwise it falls apart
 kabhi-kabhi rachana-tattvon kaa saamanjasy us kshati kii aapurti kar detaa he, jo rachana ke kisi vishesh tatva-dosha se utpann hoti he or is prakaar yah saamanjasy udaatt-prabhaav ko akshunn banaaye rakhata he
 Therefore, the dignified and magnificent composition-law is also the nutrient of sublime-creation
 lonzinus ne udaatt ke virdohi tattvon par bhi vichaar kiya he
 He has considered balata, unrestrained vagvistar, chaotic pedagogy, inferior words, mood and rhetoric, unwanted brevity, unnecessary decor, excessive emphasis on music and rhythm, etc
 as the antithesis of sublime
 atah shreshth kavi ko apni rachana main inhen sthaan nahin dena chahie
 This is a major flaw of the genre
 ‘baley’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘bachakaana’
 Just as agility, numbness, lightness and shortness are found in children, baldness will be considered in that style
 jisamen bina sanyam ke vagsfiti kii jaae, kshudra arth dyotak shabdon kaa prayog ho or chanchal yaa asthir pad-vinyas paaya jaae
 The style becomes artificial in this
 lonzinus ke anusaar- Use of ornate and heavy words in the absence of dignity of feeling
 jaise griddha jaise chote padaarth ke liye ‘jivit samadhi’ shabd kaa prayog
 Vagadambar arises from the attempt of sublime encroachment
 jahaan lekhak madyap kii bhanti aacharan kar praayah anpekshit, nirarthak or asangat aaveg kii abhivyakti karata he arthath jahaan aaveg ke niyantran kii aavashyaktaa hone par bhi aaveg kii abhivyakti kii jaae
 The expression of impulse gives rise to mood and reduces subluxation
 logon ko prabhavit karne ke moh main atishyoktipurna kathan hi shabdaadambar he
 Bihari couplets in Hindi suffer from this defect
 udaahranarth, lonzinus kaa mat he ki stri ke liye chakshu-dansh athwa ‘chakshu-phoduk’ or ‘putali’ ke liye ‘aankh kii kumari’ aadi shabdon kaa prayog maatr shabdaadambar he, bhashaa kaa alankaar nahin he
 In later critics, Hegel compares it to beauty to illustrate the nature of the sublime
 uske matanusaar soundarya kaa arth he saamanjasy
 In beauty, there is a harmony between the object and art aspects
 udaatt kii sthiti sundar se bhinn he
 Sublime is one where his emotion is more expansive and quintessential than his form
 higel yah bhi maanate hai ki udaatt ke mul main vichaaron kii utkrushtataa he or vichaaron kii mahatta vyakti ke ucch charitra se janm paati he
 If the character of a person is great then his thoughts will also be great

 We can take the example of creation of the sublime element, the great form of Hanuman presented in the pyramid and the beautiful form of ramacharitra-manas, the great form of Krishna in the Mahabharata, etc

 vastutah udaatt kaa vivechan or vishleshan lonzinus ke ‘peri ipsus’ me sarvaadhik rup main hua he
 The lofty theory of Longinus is the result of western review
 unka ‘udaatt’ jivan ke arjeet paksh kii abhivyakti hai, madhur paksh ke liye usamen koi sthaan nahin he
 Therefore, his scripture is incomplete due to discussing half of life
 bhartiya kavyashastra kii purnataa usamen kahan, jisamen oj ke saath maadhurya gun bhi he
 On one side there is heroic and wonderful rasa and on the other hand there is adornment and humor
 vah sampoorn maanav kii kriti he
 The reason for this loneliness in Longinus's belief is that he composed his book as a form of speech, not poetry

 Unlike the term intergovernmental organization, "NGO" is a common usage term, but not a legal definition
 kai nyaayalayon main is prakaar ke sanghathanon ko "naagarik samaaj sanghathan" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he yaa anya naamon se nirdisht kiya jaataa he
 It is estimated that the number of internationally active ngos is 40,000

 antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathan gulaami-virodh andolan or mahila matadhikaar andolan main mahatvapurn the or vishwa nirastrikaran sammelan ke samay ek chotii par pahunch gaye
 However, the phrase "non-governmental organization" came into popular use with the founding of the United Nations Organization in 1945, with the provisions of the advisory role for those organizations which are neither official in Article 71 of Chapter 10 of the United Nations Charter and Nor does the Member of State - Advisor see position
 The definition of "international NGO" is first given in the 288 Resolution of the ECOSOC on 27 February 1950: it is defined as "any international organization not established by an international treaty"
 vahneey vikaas main, gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon or anya samoohon kii mahatvapurn bhoomika ko agenda 21 ke adhyay 27 main manyata di gai, jiske parinamswaroop sanyukt raashtra or gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke bich ek salaahkaar rishte ke liye teevr vyavastha kii gai
 The rapid development of non-governmental sectors in Western countries resulted from the processes of reorganization of the welfare state

 antarrashtriya sandhiyon or antarrashtriya sanghathanon jaise vishwa vyapaar sanghathan ko poonjivadi udhyamon ke hiton par bahut adhik kendrit mana gaya
 Some argued that in an effort to counter this trend, ngos have evolved to emphasize humanitarian issues, advancement assistance and sustainable development

htm== gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke prakaar =="NGO" ke alaava aksar vaikalpik shabdon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye: swatantra kshetra, swayamsevi kshetra, naagarik samaaj, nichle str ke sanghathan, antarrashtriya saamaajik andolan sanghathan, nijee svaichhik sanghathan, swavlamban sanghathan or gaiyr-rajya kalakaar 
 Non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group
 "NGO" shabd ke aasapaas adivarnik shabdon kii ek lambii suchi viksit ho gayi he
 These include: gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke anek vargeekaran bhi hai
 The typology used by the World Bank divides them into operational and advocacy: ek parichaalanaatmak gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kaa praathmik uddeshy vikaas-sambandhit pariyojanon ko dizin or karyanvit karnaa he
 One frequently used classification is the division into relief-oriented as opposed to development-oriented organizations; They may also be divided according to whether they put more emphasis on service delivery or participation, or whether they are religious or secular and they are more public or private oriented
 Operational ngos can be community-based, national or international
 ek pratipaalan gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kaa praathmik uddeshy ek vishisht vishay ko badhaava dena yaa uskaa paksh samarthan karnaa he
 Unlike operational project management, these organizations generally seek to raise awareness, acceptance and information through publicity, press work and activist events
 USAID gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ko nijee svaichhik sanghathanon ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 However many scholars say that this definition is highly uncertain as many ngos are virtually funded by the state and companies and handle projects with professional staff
 gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kai kaarnon ke liye maujuud hai, aamtaur par apane sadasyon yaa muldharakon ke rajnatik yaa saamaajik lakshyon ko protsaahan dene ke liye
 Examples include: improving the state of the natural environment, promoting adherence to human rights, improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing the agenda of a company

 unhen yah ahsaas ho gaya ki safalataa ke liye bahut madad kii jarurat thi
 The band's manager at the time was Danny mcintosh
 litbody ne unhen "pop main gussell aadmi: mahaan, mahaan aadmi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 He said that he loves the band with "every atom in his body" and was never angry with them
 usne us dauraan band ko saath rakhane ke liye unke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya he
 mcintosh owned a golden splitter bus that the band used to present concerts on the go
 jeepster ne 2001 main snow petrol choda, yah ek aisa nirnay tha jisaki aalochana hot press patrika ne buddhiheenata kahkar kii
 Then band manager Danny mcintosh compared the label's relationship with the band to a wedding that was in a bad phase: "they gave us a big chance so we fell in love with them
" phir ladaai or bahes shuru ho gayi or ham bas yahi kah sakate hai ki donon pakshon ne talaak daayar kar diya"
 july 2001 se, kai pramukh labalon ne snow petrol main ruchi dikhaani shuru kar di thi, lekin band aarthik mandi se guzar rahaa tha or uske paas koi ricard nahin tha
 Lightbody sold a large part of their record collection to raise money so that the band could continue
 litbody ne us samay ko "dayaneey" bataaya, lekin unhen puraa bharosa tha ki jaldi hi duusare label ke saath unka anubandh ho jaayegaa
 haalanki, united kingdom main sangeet drishy kaa rujhaan america band kii ore chalaa gaya tha or british band ke saath anubandh nahin ho rahe the
 During this time the band spent all their time writing songs
 Lightbody bored this time, adding a Scottish supergroup, The Reindeer Section, and found a record label to release the group's recordings
 queen ne kaha ki haalanki yah samay sabake liye kathin tha jisamen nathaan bhi shaamil the, phir bhi alag hone kaa sawaal kabhi nahin uthaa
 yahi vah daur tha jis vakt band ne ek kamare main dhvanik guitar par "ran" likhaa, jo baad main band kaa mahatvapurn ekal bana
 The band's most "pathetic time" came when they performed concerts for 18 people at a famous strip club in High Wycomb
 sho ek ghatiya viipi kshetra main hua or prabandhan ko pole nartkiyon dwaara istemaal main laaye jane vaale polon ko kholana padaa jisase band ke pradarshan ke liye jagah ban sake
 Quinn described the show as "bad"
 dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye aatur band ne £200 ekatrit kiye jisase vah apane ko mercury prize ke liye namankit kar sake lekin vah manonith hone main asafal rahaa
 In 2002, the band began to be controlled and published by Jazz Summers of Big Life

el se pehle, us samay belafast main echemavi ke ek store room main kaam kar rahe the
 Connolly and the band had a shared friend, who introduced him to her

 However, Lightbody himself later denied it, saying that once he got excited he asked the Chancellor if he would contract him
 or unhone kaha: "haan, main yahan sirf yahi sunishchit karne aayaa tha ki kahin aap dix to nahin the
 "the band considered their future for a few months before contracting
 band ko anubandhit karaane main manager samars kii bhi pramukh bhoomika thi
 Initially the band was nervous about the influence of the label, fearing that they might do things that they disliked to earn money from them
 khatre kii ghanti tab bajane lagi jab chancelar ne unhen nirmaataa jainiff lee se milaayaa, jo 90 ke dashak main pank rock band campalsan main guitaravadak the or iske baavjood unhen us vakt rock production kaa koi anubhav nahin tha, jo us samay basament jacks or eminem ke saath kaam karne ke liye jane jate the
 Lee was chosen because the Chancellor was confident that he would be able to move out of Indy to the mainstream pop rock sound
 haalanki, apane tisare studio album ke ricarding ke shuruaati dinon main kuch saptaah tak band ko ek nai disha apnaane main kaaphi sangharsh karnaa padaa tha, ant main yah sahyog bahut safal siddh hua
 Lee offered suggestions on simplifying his songs and harmonizing with other voices, such as chord, and Snow Patrol accepted these suggestions which greatly benefited him and he helped producer Lee truly help the band And expressed gratitude for doing "amazing work"
 hit quarters ke saath saakshaatkaar main chancelar ke anusaar, "kuch band studio main jo hota he use lekar kuch zyada hi rakshaatmak ho jate hai
 Snow petrol was not like this
 ve kaaphi had tak yah jaahir karnaa chaahate the, "haan, ham is baar vastav main safal hona chaahate hai

 The tradition of grammar in Sanskrit is very ancient
 sanskrit bhashaa ko shuddh rup main jaanane ke liye vyakaran shaastra kiya jaataa he
 Due to its specialty, it is considered to be the most important part of the Veda
 vyakaran ke multah paanch prayojan hai - raksha, ooh, aagam, laghu or asandeh
 The following verse about grammar is very famous
 - - For which "vihasya" is of sixth aspect and "vihaya" is of fourth aspect; "aham and katham" can be dualised
 main aise vyakti kii patni kaise ho sakati hoon ? Sanskrit has three words - singular, dual and plural
 sankhya main ek hone par ekvachan kaa, do hone par dwivachan kaa tathaa do se adhik hone par bahuvachan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Doer karm - ko Karan - to, by sampradaan - ke liye Desolation sambandh - kaa, kii, ke, raa, ri, re, naa, ni, ne, Tribunal - in, on, but sambodhan - he, are, In Sanskrit there are three statements - kartavachaya, karmavachaya and bhavavachaya
 sanskrit main lat, lit, lut, lrut, let, lot, land, lin, lung, lruth – ye das lakaar hote hai
 In fact these are ten suffixes that are added to metals
 in dason pratyayon ke prarambh main 'l' he isliye inhen 'lakaar' kehete hai 
 Out of these ten laksa, the beginning of the six laksa is' t 'at the end - littlit lutti etc
 Therefore these are called tilatkaras and the last four lakaras are called nature because they have' '' at the end
 vyakaranshastra main jab dhaatuon se pibati, khaadati aadi rup siddh kiye jate hai tab in tit or saiit shabdon kaa bahut baar prayog kiya jaataa he
 These lacquers are used to describe the action of various periods
 jaise – jab vartmaan kaal kii kriya bataani ho to dhaatu se lat lakaar jod denge, paroksh bhootkaal kii kriya bataani ho to lit lakaar jodenge
 Like Ltkar: - Shyam: Khelati
 lit lakaar jo apane saath na ghatit hokar kisi itihaas kaa vishay ho 
 Such as: Ram: Ravanam Mamar
 lut lakaar jo aaj kaa din chhod kar aage hone vaala ho 
 Such as: - Best school lrut lakaar jo aane vaale kisi bhi samay main hone vaala ho 
 Such as: --- Ram: Id work let lakaar Lotter like: - Bhavan gachhatu
 ; sah kridetu 
 ; Quick manure
 ; kimahan vadani 
 However, whatever has happened, except today
 jaise :- bhavan tasmin dine bhojanmapachat 
 Likar = There are two types of Laksar: - lung lakaar jo kabhi bhi biit chukaa ho 
 Such as: - Ego food
 lruth lakaar jab kisi kriya kii asiddhi ho gai ho 
 Such as: - If you are unconcerned, thirteenth scholar, bhavitum arhishyat
 is baat ko samaran rakhane ke liye ki dhaatu se kab kis lakaar ko jodenge, nimnlikhit shloke samaran kar lijie- Add in the order of pratyahar and add them in chronological order
 phir baad main jodate jaaain jab tak ki dash lakaar puure na ho jaaen 
 Like Litt Litt Lutt Llut Llitz Llut Llr ङ In these the letter is used only in the Veda
 lok ke liye nau lakaar shesh rahe 
 Now there are two distinctions of people in these nine laksa: - Ashiril and Vidhilika
 is prakaar lok main dash ke dash lakaar ho gaye 
 2) Duality 3) karmdharay 4) Multivariate 5) avyayibhav 6) Dual samaas kriya padon main nahin hota
 The first term of the compound is called the 'former verse', the rest is called the 'north post'
 samaas ke todane ko vigrah kehete hai, jaise -- "ramashyamou" yah samaas he or raamah c shyaamah c iskaa vigrah he
