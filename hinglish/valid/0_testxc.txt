 At this time, Ghori's assistant commander, Bakhriyar Khilji, took control of Bengal and Bihar

 Aibak's claim to the throne was weak but he worked efficiently under adverse conditions and eventually became the lord of Delhi's power
 gori kii mrityu ke baad 24 june 1206 ko qutubuddin kaa rajarohan hua par usne sultan kii oopaadhi dhaaran nahin kii
 The reason was that other slave chieftains Yaldauz and Kubacha were jealous of him

 14 agast 1947 ko bharat vibhajit hua or purv or pashchim main ek nae desh pakistan ne janm liya
 The dream of Quaid Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan came true
 nayaa desh banane ke saath hi desh ke liye vibhinn chinh or pratik chunane kaa kaam bhi shuru hua
 The country's flag was already prepared, but the national anthem was not made
 azaadi ke samay pakistan ke paas koi raashtra-geet nahi tha
 Therefore whenever the flag was chanted, "pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Pindabad" slogans were raised
 jinnah ko yah manzur nahi tha
 He wanted that the work of creating the national song of Pakistan should be completed soon
 unke salaah kaaron ne unako anekon janemaane urdu shaayaron ke naam sujhaaye jo geet rach sakate the
 But Jinnah's thinking was different
 unhen laga ki duniya ke samaksh pakistan kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi sthapit karne kaa yah acha mauka he
 So he told the great Urdu poet and native Hindu Jagannath Azad of Lahore that "I can give you only five days, you can write a national song for Pakistan"
 jagannatha azaad achambhit bhi the or khush bhi the
 But the radical leaders of Pakistan were very angry that a Hindu would write the national anthem of Pakistan
 lekin jinnah kii marzi ke aage ve bebas the
 Finally, within five days Jagannath Azad composed the national song which Jinnah liked very much
 gane ke bol the - Oh my heart, your love is better than mine, today your happiness is nowhere jinnah ne ise raashtra-geet ke rup me manyata di or unki mrityu tak yahi geet raashtra-geet bana rahaa
 But just 18 months after the acceptance of this song, Jinnah died and with him the recognition of the national song was ended
 jagannatha azaad baad main bharat chale aae
 After Jinnah's death, the Government of Pakistan formed a rashtra-geet Committee
 or jane maane shairo ke paas se geet ke namoonay mangavaaye
 But no song was able to become a national song
 aakhirkaar pakistan sarkaar ne 1950 me ahamed chagala dwaara rachit dhun ko rashtriya dhun ke rup me manyata di
 At the same time, Shah of Iran visited Pakistan and liked the tune
 yah dhun paashchaatya adhik lagati thi, lekin raashtra-geet cameti kaa maananaa tha ki iskaa yah swaroop paashchaatya samaaj me adhik sweekrut hoga
 In 1954, Urdu poet Hafiz Jalandhari composed a song based on this tune
 yah geet raashtra-geet cameti ke sadasyon ko pasand bhi aayaa
 And finally the song written by Hafiz Jalandhari became the national song of Pakistan

 dhruv kaa arth he 'nishchit'
 The polarized wave has oscillations in a finite form whereas the polarized wave has equal oscillations in all directions
 kisi gas yaa drav main gatiman dhwani tarangen dhruvan kaa gun pradarshit nahin karatin kyonki unki gati kii disha or dolan kii disha ek hi hoti he
 The beam of ordinary light is symmetric relative to the transmission direction, but in special cases it is characterized by asymmetry or unilaterality
 yah baat tourmaileen naamak hare rang ke prakritik crystal kii pattica ke dwaara aasaani se pramanit ho sakati he
 When ordinary light passes through this plate, the intensity of the beam does not change when the fillet rotates on the axis of the beam, but when this beam coming out of the terramine, rotating the second plate of the tourmaline, the intensity of the beam There is a lot of change in
 jab donon tourmailinon ke aksh samaantar hote hai tab to tivrata adhiktam hoti he
 As the angle between these axes increases, the intensity decreases and when it becomes equal to the right angle, the intensity value becomes zero
 spasht he ki pratham tourmaileen main se nikalne par prakaash main asamamiti kaa aisa gun utpann ho gaya he jo saadhaaran prakaash main nahin tha
 The name of this property is "dhruvana" and this quality of light is called "dhruvit"
 is drushti se saadhaaran prakaash "adhruvit" kehalaata he
 Through the phenomena of interference and diffraction, it becomes clear that just like sound, the transmission of light is in the form of waves and a material called ether has been conceived as the medium for this transmission
 dhruvan kii uparyukt ghatana yah pramanit karti he ki prakashtarangen dhwanitarangon ke samaan anudairdhya nahin hoti, kyonki anudairthay tarangon main kampan sancharan kii disha main hone ke kaaran uparyukt prakaar kii asamamiti sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, light waves are transverse, ie their vibrations are in the right-angled direction from waves like vibrations of the star's wire
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki anuprastha tarang main madhyam ke kan kaa kampanpath saral rekhaatmak hi ho
 It is necessary that the vibrational path is located in a plane on which the direction of wave propagation is normal
 at: is kampanpath kii akruti dirghavrittakar tathaa vishesh avasthaaon main vrittakar bhi ho sakati he
 The wave in which the shape of the vibration and if the vibration is simple linear, its direction is unchanged, it is called polar wave and in which this shape or direction keeps changing, it is called inverted
 is drushti se dhruvit prakaash nimnlikhit teen prakaar kaa ho saktaa he : 1
 level polarized 2
 dirghavritt dhruvit 3
 Circle Polarized
 ganitiya adhyayan se vidit he ki companon kii ye vibhinn akritiyaan, do samakonik saral aavart companon ke sangyojan se praapt hoti hai
 Conversely, whatever the shape of the vibration is, the decomposition of it can yield two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 jab prakashtarang kisi paardarshee crystal main pravesh karti he, tab uske companon kaa aisa vighatan pratyaksht: ho jaataa he or do samtal dhruvit kirane crystal main prakat ho jaati hai
 Their vibrations are right-angled
 saamanyat: ye bhinn dishaao main gaman karti hai or unke veg baraabar nahin hote
 This phenomenon is called bivariation and by this, Heisenz invented polarization in 1960
 tourmaileen ke crystal main in do kirnon main se ek kaa avasorana ho jaataa he
 This is the reason for the origin of light polarized by Tourmaline
 is prakaash ke companon kii disha tourmaileen pattica ke crystalia aksh kii disha par nirbhar karti he or us pattica ko ghumaane se companon kii disha bhi badal jaati hai
 But the shape or direction of vibrations in ordinary superfluous light varies continuously from moment to moment, so when it comes out of the tourmaline, the intensity of the polar light also changes, but its average value is equal in each position of the tourmaline
 And this is what we see
 kintu jab samtal dhruvit prakaash, jiskaa aayam he, tourmaileen main se hokar nikalataa he tab vah dhruvit to rahata he, parantu uskaa aayam ghatakar ho jaataa he, jahaan tourmaileen kii sthiti kaa suchak kone he
 q = 0 is considered when the amplitude is greatest
 ko q = 90 degree hone par aayam a = 0 ho jaataa he or pargamit prakaash kaa lop ho jaataa he, chaahe aaptit prakaash ke aayam kaa maan kitna hi bada kyon na ho
 The ellipse also polarizes the polarized light to the tourmaline plane, and its intensity also increases by rotating the tourmaline, but it never completely disappears
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke aaptit prakaash main paraspar samakonik, kintu bhinn ayaamon vaale do avyav kampan hote hai or jab q = 0 kii sthiti main ek avyav kaa aayam mahattam hota he tab duusare kaa lop ho jaataa he or q = 90 degree hone par pehle aayam kaa lop hota he or doosraa aayam mahattam ho jaataa he
 Tourmaline cannot change the intensity of polar-polarized light, because its two components vibrations have equal dimensions, ie
 at: isamen bhi adhruvit prakaash kii hi tarah samamiti kaa gun hota he
 Yet it is polarized light
 isko pahchaanane kii yukti aage bataai jaaegi
 The vibrations are simple in line and their direction is constant
 at: ise rekha dhruvit bhi kehete hai
 The reason for the name of the polar plane is that the vibrations of all the points of such a ray of light are in the same plane
 samtal dhruvit prakaash utpann karne ke anya upaay nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Diffusion occurs in crystals such as nickel prism - calcite, but the two mutually flat plane rays are so close that only one of them is difficult to obtain
 kintu kailcite ke visheshu yukti se kaate hue do prismon ko canada baalsam se jodakar ek samaantar falki prism bana liya jaataa he, jise nikal prism kehete hai
 Upon entering Canada, on reaching Balsam, a ray is completely reflected and goes to the lateral and is destroyed there, but the second ray goes straight out
 yah prism acha paardarshee hota he
 Thus, the flat, polar light obtained from it is the color of incident light
 2
 polaroid - isamen herapathite naamak khanij ke sookshm crystalon ko vishesh yukti se saloloid ke do takhton ke bich main is prakaar samaantar sthiti main jamaa diya jaataa he jisase ve sab milakar ek lambey chaude crystal kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 This produces flat polarized light, similar to tourmaline
 ise polaroid kehete hai
 Its very long wide planks can be made
 is rang halakaa haraa hota he
 In 1941, an even better device was devised, whereby the molecules of polyvinyl alcohol are deposited in a parallel state
 ise paularoid-ech kehete hai
 It has no color at all and 99
99 percent of the light is polarized
 3
 paravartan - san 1810 main malus ne pramanit kiya tha ki jal yaa kaach jaise kisi paardarshee padaarth ke prishth se paravartit prakaash main dhruvan kaa gun anshat: paaya jaataa he or aapatan kone vishesh maan kaa hone par vah purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 This incidence angle is called the "polar angle"
 brooster ke niyamanusaar yadi dhruvak kone i ho tathaa paravartak padaarth kaa vartanaank m ho to sp hota he
 4
 Filletganj - Although the reflected light at the polar angle is completely polarized by the fillet of the slab, the light transmitted from it is never fully polarized, it is only partially polarized, but the light transmitted from among several plaques progressively
 The polarization increases progressively and when the number of plaques becomes sufficient, it becomes almost completely flat
 patali patali kai patticoon ke aise samooh ko pattikapunj kehete hai
 5
 Scattering - When light falls on very small particles present in a transparent medium, then the light circulating around them is also normally fractionated
 kintu jo prakaash praathmik kiran se samakonik disha main prakirnit hota he, vah purnat: samtal dhruvit hota he
 This can be seen in the blue light of the sky, which is only the sunlight transmitted by the molecules of air
 jis prakaar yah maaloom karne ke liye ki koi prakaash samtal dhruvit he yaa nahin or yadi he to uskaa dhruvanatal koun-sa he, tourmaileen kaa upyog hota he, thik usee tarah dhruvan utpann karne ke uparyukt sabhi sadhano kaa upyog bhi is kaary ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The solution to produce this is that flat polarized light is injected onto a bipartite crystal, such as a mica plate, on a regular basis
 isse do bhinn ayaamon vaali samakonat: dhruvit kirane bhinn vegon se ek hi maarg par crystal main chalati hai
 On exiting from it, some time is generated in these two rays and by combining the two, ellipse polarized light is obtained
 yadi crystal pattica kii motaai itani ho ki kalantar 90 degree ho jaae to us pattica ko chaturthaansh tarangapattica kehete hai
 Rotating this fillet increases the amplitude of one beam and decreases the other
 jis sthiti main donon aayam baraabar ho jate hai, usamen pargamit prakaash vruttadhruvit ho jaataa he
 a quadrant wavelet is also used to identify such polarities
 yah ddeerghaavritiya athwa vrittiya companon kaa pun: do samakonik saral rekhaatmak companon main vighatan kar detaa he or pattica ko ghumaque yathochit sthiti main laane se vah unke kalantar ko gata yaa badhaakar 0 degree yaa 180 degree kar detaa he
 Therefore, the transmitted light becomes flat again polarized, which can be identified by tourmaline or nickel
 anshadhruvit athwa adhruvit prakaash se is kriya dwaara samtal dhruvit prakaash praapt nahin ho saktaa, kyonki anshadhruvit prakaash adhruvi tathaa samtal dhruvit prakaash kaa mishran hota he or adhruvit prakaash kaa tourmaileen dwaar lop kabhi bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Having knowledge of the direction of vibrations in plane polarized light, a polar plane was conceived and defined as: The polar plane is the import plane of a perfectly flat polar beam obtained by reflection
 at: tourmaileen kii jis sthiti main is paravartit kiran kii tivrata nasht ho jaati he usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he
 a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate and then the polar surface of any polarized light can be seen from such tourmaline
 ise jaanane ke liye saralatam yukti yah he ki kisi andhere kamare main samtal dhruvit prakaash kii patali kiran urdhwadhar disha main chalaai jaae
 The path of the ray will remain invisible, but if the smoke of very thin particles is generated near this ray by burning the paper, the path of the beam will be visible due to the light transmitted from those particles
 kintu chaaron ore ghumkar dekhne se kisi ek dishavishesh main kiran adrishy hi rahegi
 Apparently scattering does not occur in this direction
 at: yahi kampan kii disha he, kyonki kampan kii disha main anuprastha tarang nahin chal sakati
 By this measure it has been known that the direction of vibration is right-angled from the polar plane, ie the vibrations of the reflected beam at the polar angle are right-angled from the emergency plane
 yahi baat anya upayon se bhi pramanit ho gai he
 According to the electromagnetic theory of light, each beam has both electromagnetic and magnetic vibrations, and they are also parasitic
 is siddhant se yah bhi prakat hota he ki dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main vaidyut kampan apattal se samakonik hote hai
 Therefore, it results that the vibrations of light affecting the eyes are electrical, not magnetic
 dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main companon ke apaat tal se samakonik hone kaa taatpary spashtat: yah he ki yadi apati kiran ke kampan apaat tal main hon, to uskaa paravartan dhruvak kone par bilkul hi nahin, hota
 Therefore, when the angle of incidence is equal to the polar angle, then the polar light in the emergency can be reflected, but the emergency cannot reflect the polar light at right angles
 jyotimaapan main is baat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki prakaash kii tivrata ko icchaanusaar ghataya ja sake or yah bhi ham yatharthatapurvak jaan saken ki is ghati purv tivrata main or purvavarti tivrata main kya anupaat he
 Two nickel prisms are used for this
 jab donon samaantar avasth main hote hai, tab to uttarottar donon main hokar nikalanevaale prakaash kii tivrata mahattam hoti hai, kintu yadi donon kii sthitiyon ke bich main kone ho to tivrata ke anupaat main ghat jaati he
 Polaroid can also be used for this purpose
 domat ek prakaar kii mitti he jo fasalon ke liye atyant urvar ) hoti he
 It contains about 40% silt, 20% clay and the remaining 40% sand
 pani tathaa vaayu ke pravesh hetu arthath adhik chhidril hone ke kaaran fasalon kii urvara shakti adhik hoti he
 Such soil has a water holding capacity of 50% of its total load
 is mitti main poshak padaarthon kii maatra bhi adhik hoti he
 Different types of clay, sand and clay loam in loam soil form different types of loam such as loamy loam, silty loam, loam loam, loamy loam etc
 chikani mitti kii apeksha domat mitti main adhik poshak padaarth, adhik nami, adhik humas hota he
 The plowing of loam soil is easier than that of clay
 isamen silti mitti kii apeksha hawa or pani ko chaanane tathaa jal-nikaas kii behatar kshamta hoti he
 The loam soil is considered to be good for horticulture and agricultural purposes
 yadi kisi balui yaa chikani mitti main bhi adhik maatra main jaivik padaarth mili hon to uske gun bhi domat jaise hi honge
 Mahamahopadhyay Pandit Yudhishthira Mimansak was a famous Sanskrit scholar and a devoted critic of Vedic poetry
 unhone sanskrit ke prachaar-prasar main apana amuly yogadan diya
 Pandit Yudhishthira Mimansak was born in the village named Virakchayavas under Ajmer District of Rajasthan, Bhadrapad Shukla Navami No
 1966 A

 accordingly took place on 22 September 1909 with Pt
 Gaurilal Acharya
 pan gaurilaal saraswat brahman the tathaa aryasamaj ke maun prachaarak ke rup main aaajeevan kaary karte rahe
 Mimansakji's mother's name was Mrs
 Yamuna Devi
 mata ke man main is baat kii badi aakanksha thi ki uskaa putr gurukul main adhyayan kar sachcha vedapathi brahman bane
 Mother died at the same time when Yudhishthira was only 8 years old, but before his death, mother had taken the promise from her husband that they must enter this child in the Gurukul
 tadnusaar 12 varsh kii avasthaa main yudhisthir ko swami sarvadanand dwaara sthapit sadhu ashram pul kaali nadi main 3 agast 1921 ko pravisht kara diya gaya
 At that time Pt
 Brahmadatta Jigyasu, Pt
 Shankar Dev and Pt
 Buddhadev Upadhyaya used to work in that ashram
 kuch samay pashchaat yah ashram gandasinhavaala chalaa gaya
 Here his name was called Virjanandashram Rakha
 paristhitivash disambar 1925 main pan brahmadatt jigyaasu tathaa pan shankardev 12-13 vidhyaarthiyon ko lekar kaashi chale gaye
 Study of these students continued in a rented house here
 lagbhag dhaai varsh ke pashchaat ghatnaon main kuch parivartan aayaa jiske kaaran jigyasuji inamen se 8-9 chaatro ko lekar punah amritsar aa gaye
 The sons of Shri Ramlal Kapoor, a well-known paper trader, Amritsar resident, had set up the Sri Ramlal Kapoor Trust with a view to publishing and promoting Vedic literature in memory of his late father, and he called Shri Curious to Amritsar to carry out this important work
 lagbhag saadhe teen varsh amritsar main yudhisthirji kaa adhyayan chalata rahaa
 After some time, the curious returned to Kashi with some students
 unka is baar ke kaashi aagaman kaa prayojan mimasaa darshan kaa swayan adhyayan karne tathaa apane chaatro ko bhi is darshan ke gambheer adhyayan kaa avasar pradaan karana tha
 As a result, Yudhishthiraji, having remained a Kashi, did a thorough follow-up of this scripture with his contemporaries like Pandit Chini Swami Shastri and Pt Pattabhiram Shastri, and was able to gain authority on this dry and arduous subject by the grace offerings of the gurus
 mimasaa kaa adhyayan karne ke pashchaat yudhisthirji apane guru pan brahmadatt jigyaasu ke saath 1935 main lahore laute or raavi nadi ke paar barahdari ke nikat raamalaal kapur ke parivaar main ashram kaa sanchaalan karne lage
 Virjanandashram remained here till the partition of India
 1947 main jab lahore pakistan main chalaa gaya, to jigyasuji bharat aa gaye
 In 1950, he again established Panini College in Kashi and organized the work of Ramlal Kapoor Trust
 pan yudhisthir bhi kabhi kaashi, to kabhi dilli athwa ajmer main rahete hue trust ke kaamon me apana sahyog dete rahe
 His Saraswat session continued
 dilli tathaa ajmer main rahakar unhone ‘‘bhartiya praachya vidya pratishthan’’ ke madhyam se swa granthon kaa lekhan va prakaashan kiya
 Meanwhile, he was also the chairman of the research department under Dayanand Janmasthan Smarak Trust located in Tankara in 1959-1960
 1967 se aaajeevan ve behalgarh sthit raamalaal kapur trust ke kaaryon ko sambhaal rahe hai
 The President of India honored him as a high scholar of Sanskrit in 1976 and the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University Varanasi conferred him with the title Mahamaopadhyay in 1989
 1985 main aryasamaj santakruj bombay ne mimasakaji ko 75000 ru

 Pt
 Yudhishthira Mimansak, besides editing the ancient scriptures, has done the work of editing Rishi Dayanand's works critically
 iske atirikt unke moulik granthon kii sankhya bhi paryaapt he
 Later, when the original Marathi text of these discourses became available in time, Mimansakji translated and published them directly from Marathi in 1983

 On 15 August 1947, India became independent from Britain and under the interim arrangement the country became a Commonwealth dominion
 is vyavastha ke tahat bharat ke governor general ko bharat ke rashtrapramukh ke rup main sthapit kiya gaya, jinhen british india main britain ke antarim raja - jorge VI dwaara british sarkaar ke bajaay bharat ke pradhanmantri kii salaah par niyukt karnaa tha
 This was a temporary measure, but continuing the existence of a shared monarchy in the Indian political system was not in the true sense of a right for a sovereign nation

 The description of Ganga is found somewhere in the Rigveda, but the stories related to Ganga in the Puranas came on their own
 kaha jaataa he ki ek prafullit sundari yuvati kaa janm brahmadev ke kamandal se hua
 There are two thoughts about this special birth
 ek kii manyata he ki vaaman rup main rakshas bali se sansar ko mukt karaane ke baad brahmadev ne bhagwaan vishnu kaa charan dhoyaa or is jal ko apane kamandal main bhar liya
 The second is related to Lord Shiva who saved the raga-ragini suffering from the misuse of music
 jab bhagwaan shiv ne naarad muni brahmadev tathaa bhagwaan vishnu ke samaksh gaanaa gaaya to is sangeet ke prabhaav se bhagwaan vishnu kaa pasinaa bahakar nikalne laga jo brahma ne use apane kamandal main bhar liya
 Ganga was born from the water of this kamandal and she started living in heaven under the protection of Brahma
 aisi kimbadanti he ki prithvi par ganga kaa avataran raja bhagirath ke kathin tap se hua, jo suryavanshi raja tathaa bhagwaan ram ke purvaj the
 Next to the temple is a Bhagirath Shila where Bhagiratha worshiped Lord Shiva
 kaha jaataa he ki jab raja sagar ne apana 100waan ashwamegh yajna kiya to indradev ne apana rajya chhin jane ke bhay se bhaybheet hokar us ghode ko kapil muni ke ashram ke paas chipa diya
 While searching for the horse, 60,000 sons of King Sagara harassed and humiliated Kapil Muni who was absorbed in asceticism
 kshubdh hokar kapil muni ne aagney drushti se tatkshan sabhi ko jalaakar bhasma kar diya
 On apologizing, the sage said that the soul of the sons of King Sagara will be liberated only when Gangajal touches them
 sagar ke kai vanshajon dwaara aradhana karne par bhi ganga ne avatarit hona asweekaar kar diya
 In the end, King Bhagirath, a descendant of King Sagara, meditated for 5500 years to please the gods
 unki bhakthi se khush hokar devi ganga ne prithvi par aakar unke shaapit purvajon kii aatma ko mukti dena sweekaar kar liya
 There was a possibility of heavy destruction due to the descent of Goddess Ganga on the earth and hence Lord Shiva was persuaded to tie Ganga in his jata
 (gangotri kaa arth hota he ganga utari arthath ganga neeche utar ai isaliye yah shahar kaa naam gangotri padaa
 Bhagirath then told Ganga to go to the place where the ashes of his ancestors lay and thus his soul was liberated
 parantu ek or durghatana ke baad hi yah hua
 Ganga immersed the ashram of Jahnu Muni in water
 muni krodh main puri ganga ko hi pi gayi par bhagirath ke aagrah par unhone apane kaan se ganga ko baahar nikaal diya
 That is why Ganga is also called Jahnavi
 barfili nadi gangotri ke muhane par, shivlinga chotii ke aadhaar sthal par ganga prithvi par utari jahaan se usne 2,480 kilometre gangotri se bengal kii khadi tak kii yatra shuru kii
 At the origin of this huge river, its name is Bhagirathi, which is in the name of that great ascetic Bhagiratha, on whose insistence Ganga left heaven and came to earth
 devprayag main alaknanda se milane par iskaa naam ganga ho gaya
 It is believed that the Pandavas, the heroes of the epic Mahabharata, performed the Dev Yagna at Gangotri to make atonement on the death of their relatives in Kurukshetra
 ganga ko praayah shiv kii jataaon main rahane ke kaaran bhi aadar paati he
 a second kimbadanti is that Ganga descended on the earth in human form and she married King Shantanu, the ancestor of the Pandavas where she gave birth to seven children and threw them into the river without giving any reason
 raja shantnu ke hastkshep karne par aathven putr bhishma ko rahane diya gaya
 But then Ganga left them and went away

" In November 2005, Berry began dating french-canadian supermodel Gabriel Aubry, nine years younger than himself
 Both met in a photoshoot of Versace
 After six months with Aubry, she told in an interview, "i'm really happy in my personal life, which is a new thing for me
 You know, I'm not the girl who has had the best relationships"

 Berry later said "actually the thing was i was backstage before the show and i have three girls who are Jewish and who work for me
 We were trying to see in some pictures who Seemed silly to look at and one of my Jewish friends said, "this could have been your Jewish cousin!" And as far as i remember, this thing was fresh in my mind and what was it just came out of my mouth
 But i did not mean to offend anyone

 It is possible that a cave is also under the sea water - such caves are called sea caves
 abhigyaan shaakuntalam mahakavi kalidas kaa vishwavikhyath naatak he jiskaa anuwaad praaia: sabhi videshi bhashaaon main ho chukaa he
 It has a beautiful story of love, marriage, marriage, reprisal and reunion of King Dushyant and Shakuntala
 puranic katha main dushyant ko akashwani dwaara bodh hota he par is naatak main kavi ne mudrika dwaara iskaa bodh karaayaa he
 Its theatricality, its beautiful narratives, its poetic-aesthetic analogies, and the periodic notes used from place to place; And above all, the acoustics of the diverse episodes are so amazing that even Sanskrit dramas cannot compete with Abhigyan Shakuntal when viewed from these points of view; Then what to say about other languages! So this is the best thing here
 kalidas ne abhigyaan shaakuntal kii kathavstu moulik nahin chuni
 This story is derived from the Adiparva of the Mahaharata
 yon padmapurana main bhi shakuntla kii katha milti he or vah mahabharat kii apeksha shakuntala kii katha ke adhik nikat he
 For this reason, Winternitz has assumed that the story of Shakuntala is derived from Padmapurana
 parantu vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki padmapurana kaa yah bhaag shakuntala kii rachana ke baad likhaa or baad main prakshipt prathit hota he
 The curse of Durvasa is not mentioned in the Mahabharata story
 mahabharat kaa dushyant se yadi thik ulataa nahin, to bhi bahut adhik bhinn he
 Shakuntala of Mahabharata is not as well-groomed as that of Kalidasa
 vah dushyant ko vishwamitra or menka ke sambandh ke falswarup hue apane janm kii katha apane munh se hi sunaati he
 In the Mahabharata, Dushyant, enchanted by the appearance of Shakuntala, prays Gandharva marriage to Shakuntala; On which Shakuntala says that i can marry on the condition that the throne be given to my son only
 dushyant us samay to sweekaar kar letaa he or baad main apni rajdhani main lautakar jaan-boojhkar lajjawash shakuntala ko grahan nahin karata
 Kalidasa has refined the narrative thus received in unsophisticated form to his imagination
 durvasa ke shaap kii kalpana karke unhone dushyant ke charitra ko ooncha uthaaya he
 Shakuntala of Kalidasa is also an idol of nobility, beauty and compassion
 iske atirikt kalidas ne sari katha kaa nirvaah, bhaavon kaa chithran ityadi jis dhang se kiya he, vah moulik or apurv he
 Shakuntala was the wife of King Dushyant who was the mother of India's well-known king Bharata and the daughter of Maneka Apsara
 mahabharat main likhaa he ki shankutala kaa janm menka apsara ke garbh se hua tha jo ise van main chhodkar chali gai thi
 It was named Shakuntala by the Shankutas etc
 in the forest which protected it from predatory animals
 van main se ise kanv rishi uthaa laae the or apane ashram main rakhkar kanya ke samaan paalate the
 Once King Dushyant went out to hunt with some soldiers with him and roamed the ashram of Kanva Rishi
 rishi us samay vahaan upasthit nahin the; isse yuvati shakuntla ne hi raja dushyant kaa aatithy satkar kiya
 On the same occasion, the two married Prem and then Gandharva
 kuch dinon baad raja dushyant vahaan se apane rajya ko chale gaye
 When Kanva Muni came back, he was very happy to know that Shakuntala was married to Dushyant
 shakuntla us samay garbhvatee ho chuki thi
 With time, a very powerful and bright son was born from her womb, named 'bharata'
 kehete hai, 'bharat' naam 'bharat' ke naam par hi padaa
 a few days later Shakuntala took her son to Dushyant's court
 parantu shakuntla ko bich main durvasa rishi kaa shaap mil chukaa tha
 The king did not recognize it at all and said clearly that neither i know you nor can you give me shelter here
 parantu isi avasar par ek akashwani hui, jisase raja ko vidit hua ki yah meri hi patni he or yah putr bhi meraa hi he
 He remembered all the things about Kanva Muni's ashram and kept Shakuntala as his head queen
 ‘abhigyaan shaakuntalam’ main anek maarmik prasangon ko ullekh kiya gaya he
 One, when Dushyant and Shakuntala meet for the first time
 doosraa us samay, jab kanv shakuntala ko apane ashram se patigrih ke liye vidaa karte hai
 At that time, the sage himself says that if a sage like me has this fascination in his parents, then what will be the situation of those whose daughters are leaving for the house
 teesraa prasang he, shakuntala kaa dushyant kii sabha main upasthit hona or dushyant ko usko pahchaanane se inkaar karnaa
 The fourth episode is of the time when a ring with the name of Dushyant received by the fisherman is shown to him
 or paanchvaan prasang marichi maharishi ke ashram main dushyant-shakuntala ke milan kaa
 The greatest miracle of Kalidasa in Shakuntala is in his phonetic signs
 isamen kavi ko vilakshan safalataa yah mili he ki usne kahin bhi koi bhi vastu nishprayojan nahin kahi
 No character, any narrative statement, any incident, no natural scene is useless
 sabhi ghatnaayen yah drishy aage aane vaali ghatnaon kaa sanket chamatkaarik reeti se pehle hi de dete hai
 In the beginning of the play, while narrating the summer, the story of the drama was broadly communicated by feeling fragrant, falling asleep and lying in the shadows and being delightful at the end of the day, with the fragrance of the forest floor
 Has gone, indicating the meeting of Shakuntala and Dushyant respectively, then forgetting Shakuntala with sleep-effects and ending the play with pleasure
 isi prakaar naatak ke praarambhik geet main bhramaron dwaara shiris ke phulon ko zaraa-zaraa-sa chuumane se yah sanket miltaa he ki dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan alpasthayee hoga
 Some ascetics stop coming when the king is running after the stag with an arrow on the bow
 kehete hai-‘maharaj’ yah ashram kaa harin he, is par tir na chalaanaa
 'in addition to the stag here, there is also a hint towards Shakuntala, who is naive and helpless like the stag
 ‘kahaan to harinon kaa atyant chanchal jivan or kahaan tumhaare vajra ke samaan kathor baan !’ isse bhi shakuntala kii asahaayta or saralata tathaa raja kii nishthurataa kaa marmasparshi sanket kiya gaya he
 When Dushyanta and Shakuntala's love starts to grow a bit more, then the cry from the back is heard saying, "tapaswiyo, get ready to protect the creatures of the ashram
" shikari raja dushyant yahaan aayaa hua he
 'there also appears to have been a hint of the defense of Shakuntala from Dushyant's hands, but this signal was not heard in anyone's ear; Nobody saved Shakuntala
 isse sthiti kii karunajanakta or bhi adhik bad jaati he
 In the early part of the fourth issue, the disciple of Kanva while describing Prabhat mentioned the constant association of happiness and sorrow and unbearable grief of women in the separation of the beloved, before Dushyanta abandoned Shakuntala
 Makes the background-c from itself
 paanchaven ank main rani hansapadika ek geet gaati hai, jisamen raja ko unki madhur-vritti ke liye ulaahna diya gaya he
 Dushyanta also confesses that he has loved Hanspadika only once
 isse kavi yah gambheer sanket detaa he ki bhale hi shakuntala ko dushyant ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran bhuulakar choda, parantu ek baar pyaar karne ke baad raniyon kii upeksha karnaa unke liye koi nai baat nahin thi
 Other queens were also victims of this sweet attitude
 hansapadika ke is geet kii prishthbhumi main shakuntala ke parityag kii ghatana or bhi krur or kathor jaan padati he
 By similar phonetic gestures, Kalidasa has set a pleasant backdrop for Dushyant, Shakuntala and his son in the seventh issue
 indra raja dushyant ko apurv sammaan pradaan karte hai
 After that, upon reaching Hemkut mountain, Prajapati's ashram, the king starts feeling as if he is bathing in the lake of nectar
 is prakaar ke sanketon ke baad dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan or bhi adhik manohar ho uthta he
 German poet Goethe had said about Abhigyan Shakuntalam- isi prakaar sanskrit ke vidwaanon main yah shloke prasiddh he- This means - Among all the forms of poetry, drama is particularly beautiful
 naatakon main bhi kavy-soundarya kii drushti se abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan main bhi uskaa chaturth ank or is ank main bhi chauthaa shloke to bahut hi romantic he
 In Abhigyan Shakuntal, there is a considerable amount of poetry as well as a portion of poetry
 isamen shringaar mukhya ras he; or uske sanyog tathaa viyog donon hi pakshon kaa paripaak sundar rup main hua he
 Apart from this, there is good expression of humor, valor and Karun Ras
 sthaan-sthaan par sundar or manoharini utprekshaayen na keval pathak ko chamatkrit kar detii hai, kintu abhisht bhav kii tivrata ko badhaane main hi sahaayak hoti hai
 In all the plays, Kalidas did not use his similes and motivations for mere ornamentation
 prayek sthaan par unki upama yaa utpreksha arth kii abhivyakti ko raspurn banane main sahaayak hui he
 Kalidas is famous in Sanskrit literature for his similes
 shaakuntal main bhi unki upyukt upama chunane kii shakti bhalee-bhaanti prakat hui
 In one place about Shakuntala, King Dushyant says that 'it is a flower that no one has smelled; Such is the Navapallava, which does not scratch anyone's fingernails; There is a gem, which is not pierced and there is a honey, which no one has tasted
 ’ in upamaaon ke dwaara shakuntala ke saundarya kii ek anokhi jhalak hamaari ankhon ke saamne aa jaati he
 Similarly, in the fifth issue Dushyanta abandons Shakuntala, saying, "O Tapaswini, do you want to tarnish your clan and impure me, like a river that breaks the coast and falls down the tree of the shore and It also taps its water
 ’ yahaan shakuntala kii chat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi se di gai upama raja ke manobhaav ko vyakt karne main vishesh rup se sahaayak hoti he
 Similarly, when Kanva's disciples take Shakuntala and reach Dushyant, Dushyant's vision falls on the Shakuntala among those ascetics
 vahaan shakuntala ke saundarya kaa vistrut varnan na karke kavi ne unke mukh se keval itnaa kahalava diya he ki ‘in tapasviyon ke bich main vah ghunghat vaali sundari koun he, jo pile patton ke bich main nai konpal ke samaan dikhaai pad rahi he
 'this small upma has depicted the beauty of Shakuntala by the goodness of the yellow leaves and the buds
 isi prakaar sarvadman ko dekhakar dushyant kehete hai ki ‘yah pratapi balak us agni ke sphuling kii bhaanti prathit hota he, jo dadhakati aag banane ke liye idhan kii raah dekhtaa he
 With this upma, Kalidas not only revealed the brilliance of the child, but has also clearly conveyed that this child will grow up to become the glorious Chakravarti emperor
 is prakaar kii manohar upamaaon ke anek udhaaharan shaakuntal main se diye ja sakate hai kyonki shaakuntal main 180 upamaayen prayukt huin hai
 And all of them surpass one by one
 yah thik he upama ke chunaav main kalidas ko vishesh kushalta praapt thi or yah bhi thik he ki unki-si sundar upmaayen anya kaviyon kii rachanaaon main durlabh hai, phir bhi kalidas kii sabase badi visheshta upama-kaushal nahin he
 Upma-kaushal is a common part of his poetry skills
 apane manobhaav ko vyakt karne athwa kisi ras kaa paripaak karne athwa kisi bhav kii teevr anubhuti ko jagaane kii kalidas anek vidhiyaan jaanate hai
 Kalidas has made his style particularly delightful by using a contextual selection of words, choosing the appropriate verses of the desired sense and using euphemism
 jahaan kalidas shakuntala ke soundarya-varnan par utre hai, vahaan unhone keval upamaaon or utprekshaon dwaara shakuntala kaa rup chithran karke hi santosh nahin kar liya he
 At first, he merely said that 'if there is so much form among the residents of Tapovan, then understand that the forest vines beat the vines of the garden
 ’ phir dushyant ke mukh se unhone kahalwaya ki ‘itani sundar kanya ko ashram ke niyam-paalan main lagaana aisa hi he jaise nil camel kii pankhuri se babul kaa ped kaatna
 'after that, Kalidas says that' Shakuntala's form is so beautiful that even though she is wearing a thick vulcanic cloth, then her beauty is not reduced to anything, but it has increased
 kyonki sundar vyakti ko jo bhi kuch pahana diya jaae vahi uskaa aabhushan ho jaataa he
 'he then compares Sukumar's body of King Shakuntala with the green flower-laden Lata, so that the image of that unique beauty is painted in front of the reader's eyes
 iske baad us saundarya kii anubhuti ko charam seemaa par pahunchane ke liye kalidas ek bhramar ko le aae hai; jo shakuntala ke mukh ko ek sundar khilaa hua phool samajhakar uskaa rasapan karne ke liye uske upar mandaraane lagata he
 Thus, Kalidasa did not take the support of the antlers to portray the beauty of Shakuntala as much as the euphemism; And this cuisine is considered to be the life of poetry

 Suryavansh, according to the Arkavansha Puranas, is an ancient Indian dynasty whose origins are believed to be from the Sun God

 Jainism and Buddha cult have emerged from this dynasty tradition

 Some names of this dynasty are also mentioned in Kalidasa's Raghuvansham

 The oldest is the Ardhamagadhi literature in which Jain religious texts have been composed and which are collectively called Jainagam or Jainshrutang
 is sahitya kii pracheen parampara yah he ki antim jain tirthankar mahavir kaa videh pradesh main janm lagbhag 600 i
 purv hua
 He took sage initiation at the age of 30 years and meditated for 12 years and attained Kaivalyana
 tatpashchaat unhone apana dharmopadesh sarvapratham rajgrih main or phir anya naanaa sthanon main dekar jain dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 His teachings were compiled by his disciples in 12 parts during his lifetime
 unke naam hai- The language of these organs is the same Ardmagadhi Prakrit in which Mahavira gave his sermons
 sambhavat: yah aagam us samay lipibaddh nahin kiya gaya evam guru-shishy parampara se maukhik rup main prachlit rahaa or yahi uske shrutang kahalaane kii sarthakata he
 Mahavira's Nirvana at the age of 72 BC It happened in 527 and shortly thereafter, antiquities began to arise in the tradition of the said organs
 jaindharm ke digambar sampradaay kii manyata he ki shrutangon kaa kramash: hraas hote-hote unka khandash: gyaan kuch aacharyo ko rahaa ore uske aadhaar se unhone nae rup main saidhantik granth likhe, jinke pracheenatam udhaaharan karmprakrit va kashayprakrit naamak sutara hai
 But the Svetambara sect believes that from time to time, the sages gave their prayers and tried to keep them safe in order to protect the said Agama texts from distortions
 pratham vaachana mahavir nirvana se 160 varsho pashchaat patliputra main sthulbhadracharya kii adhyakshata main hui jisamen 11 angon kaa sankalan kiya gaya
 None of the monks present in the 12th organ could not be saved due to lack of systematic knowledge
 jain muniyon kii aparigrah vritti tathaa varshakaal ko chhod nirantar paribhraman evam us kaal kii kathinaaiyon ke kaaran yah angagyaan pun: chhin-bhinn hone laga
 Arya Skandit held the conference of Munisingh in Mathura and tried to rearrange the same 11 organs
 devardhigani kshamashraman ne valbhi nagar main munisammelan karaayaa or jain aagam ko vah rup diya jisamen vah aaj uplabdh he
 In addition to the above mentioned 11 organs in this reading, many other texts were tried to be organized which had been composed till this time period
 ye the - 12 upang, 6 chhedsutra, 4 mulsutra, 10 prakirnak or do chulikaay
 In this way, 45 texts of Ardhamagadhi Jainagam were arranged as a result of the Vallabhi Vachhan which are available even today, and whose brief introduction is as follows: 1
 achaarang - is shrutagranth main muniyon ke paalane yogya sadachaar kaa vivaran diya gaya he
 It is divided into two braces
 pratham shrutaskandh main 9 adhyayan or unke antargat 44 uddeshyak hai
 This part of the book is the oldest in terms of origin and language, style and subject
 dwi
 shrutaskandh isaki chulika ke rup main he or vah teen chulikaaon evam 16 adhyayanon main vibhajit he
 The study of the first Shrutaskandh in the Navadhana is a poignant description of Mahavir's severe austerity and the suffering of extreme prefixes while admitting in places like Lajar Vajrabhoomi, Shubhrabhoomi etc
 2
 sutarakrutang - iske bhi do shrutaskandh hai jinamein kramash: 16 tathaa 7 adhyayan hai1 pratham shrutang praaia: madhmay he or duusare main gadhy padya donon kaa prayog hua he
 In it, the philosophical promises of ancient times like Kriyāvāda, क्रियाāriyāvāda, fatalism, ignorance etc
 have been formulated and disposed of, and the form of Shramana, Brahmin, Monk, Nigrantha etc
 has been explained
 antim adhyayan naldiya main mahavir ke shishy gautam tathaa pashravnath kii parampara ke udak pedhalputra ke bich vaartalap or chaaturyam dharm ke sambandh main vichaar jaindharm kii mahavir se purvaparampara par prakaash daalata he
 3
 Sthanang - It has 10 studies in which substances numbered from one to 10 are represented respectively, such as one philosophy, monologue, one time, etc
; The two verbs Jeeva and Ajiva; The tree has three types of sacred letters, Falopet and Pushpopet, three Vedas, Rikas, Yaju and Sama etc
 is paddati se is granth main anek vishyon kaa bahumukhi varnan aayaa he jo apane dhang kaa ek vishwakosh hi he
 His style resembles that of the Angutara body of the Pali Tripitaka
 4
 samavayang - yah bhi sthanang ke sadrush akottar kram se vastuon kaa nirupan karanevaala vishwakosh he
 Its specialty is that in it the numbering order has been extended to the increasing terms, sahasra, satshastra and kotis

 5

 6

 7
 upaskadsha - namaanusaar isamen bhi upaask, kaamdev, chulanipriy aadi das aise upaskon ke charitra varnit hai jinhone kathinaaiyon ke bich dharmapalan kiya

 10
 Querying - It is known from the introduction of this book from the name of the book and from the place and Samavayang that the original principles were explained in this form of question

 11

 Jeevajivabhigam - In the name of the question, the distinctions of Jeeva and Ajiva are described in the form of a question

 Nishith, Mahanishith, Behavior, Ethics, Kalpasutra and Panchakalpa

 There is no recognition and propagation of these 45 Agam texts in the Digambara sect
 us parampara main lupt hue dwadashang shrut ke aadhaar se shauraseni praakrit main swatantra sahitya kaa nirmaan hua jisaki sarvapracheen rachanaayen pushpadanth or bhootbalikrut karmprabhrit naamak granth hai
 In this, Jain Karmasiddhanta has been impersonated with great order and subtlety

 From time to time, many commentaries were written in Prakrit and Sanskrit, among which are presently well-known commentaries named Dhaval and Jayadhaval, whose kings Veerasen and Jinsen were often contemporaries of the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha
 pracheenta main karmprabhrit or kashaiprabhrit ke pashchaat kundakundacharyakrit 12-13 shauraseni padyatmak rachanaayen hai jinamein pradhan hai - pravachansaar, samaysar, panchastikaay or niyamsar

 samaysar, panchastika or niyamasar
 Jain theory, ethics, and post-judicial justice have all been represented in all these
 samaysar main jaisaa aadhyaamik vivechan kiya gaya he vaisaa anyatra nahin paaya jaataa
 Apart from religious literature, a lot of narrative literature of Jain tradition is also found in Prakrit

 But scholars are skeptical of its reality and it is mainly on the basis that the nature of Prakrit language found in the text is of the second stage of medieval, whose development cannot be considered before the second third century AD

 vahaan ramakathanak main valmikikrut ramayana se kuch or baaten bhi lee gai hai, jo paumchariyan main nahin hai
 Another Mahapuran composed in Prakrit prose is Bhadreshvaritha Kathavali, in which in addition to the above mentioned 54 great men, the character of all the 63 Shalakapurushas are also described in poetic manner, with the inclusion of the character of 9 Prativasudevas
 inamen vardhamanasoorikrut aavinathcharit, somprabhakrit sumatinathcharit, devsurikrut padmaprabhacharit, nemichandrakrut ananthanathcharit, devandraganikrut vardhaman charit aadi anek vishaal rachanaayen prakaash main aa chuki hai

 iskaa kathanak ek upanyaas he, jisamen paatro ke anek janmon kaa vrittant gutha hua he or vah bankrut kadambari kaa samaran karaata he
 In Prakrit prose literature, Haribhadrasurikrit Samaraditya has a special place
 yah dharmakatha he jisamen paraspar virdohi do purushon ke nau janmantaron kaa kramash: varnan kiya gaya he
 The malevolent man gets progressively downgraded in every birth due to his envy of hatred and Chatrinayak attains salvation by penance by becoming a king named Samaraditya in the last house, purifying his mind and character
 nau hi bhavon ke kathanak apane apane rup main swatantra or paripurna hai tathaa unamem maanviya bhaawanaaon tathaa samaaj ke naanaa staron kaa sudar chithran paaya jaataa he
 Haribhadra's second notable Prakrit composition is Dhurtaikhyana
 iske paanch aakhyaanon main paanch dhurton ne apane apane aise kathanak sunaae hai jinase anek puranic atishyoktipurna vrittanton kii vyangyatmak aalochana hoti he
 Thus, this poetic work is not only in Prakrit, but is a unique example of satire in ancient Indian literature
