 wolsi ne rashtriya sarkaar ko kendrikrut kar diya or parishadi adaalaton, vishisht rup se star chember, ke adhikaar-kshetra kaa vistaar kiya
 His use of forced debt to pay for foreign wars enraged wealthy people, who were also angry because of his excessive wealth and boisterous lifestyle
 jab rani catherine se ek sheeghra talaak ko bachaa paane main wolsi vifal rahe, to isse raja ko niraashaa hui
 The treasury was emptied after years of extravagance; Feudal and subjects were dissatisfied and Henry needed to adopt a completely new approach; Wolsey had to be replaced
 16 varshon tak sheersh par rahane ke baad unhone satta ganvaa di or san 1530 main unhen rajdroh ke jhuthe aaropon main giraftaar kar liya gaya or hiraasat main hi unki mrityu ho gai
 Wolsey's fall was a warning to the Pope and the clergy of England as to what could be the result of the king's failure to fulfill his wishes

 Elton argues that there was a major Tudor revolution in government
 henry ko budhimaani or chaalaaki kaa shrey dete hue, alton kehete hai ki unke adhikansh sakaaratmak krity, visheshtah rome ke saath sambandhon kii samaapti, thomas cromwel kaa kaary tha, raja kaa nahin
 Elton considers Henry a capable, but extremely lazy, subject to direct control of affairs for any extended period; That is, the king was an opportunist who depended on other people for doing most of his ideas and doing most of the work
 henry ke vaivaahik saahas alton ke pramaanon kii shrinkhalaa ke bhaag hai; alton ullekh karte hai ki ek purush, jo chah patniyon se vivaah karata he, aisa vyakti nahin he, jiskaa apane swayan ke bhagya par puraa niyantran ho
 Elton demonstrates that Thomas Cromwell envisioned a Commonwealth of England, which included popular participation through Parliament, and that this was generally expressed in the Preamble to the Law
 sansadeey sahmati kaa arth yah nahin tha ki raja ne apana koi bhi adhikaar chhod diya tha; henry ashtum ek pitrusulabh shaasha the, jo apni shakti kaa prayog karne se jhijakte nahin the
 Popular "consent" was a means of increasing it rather than limiting imperial power
 henry ne kabhi bhi aupchaarik rup se roman catholic carch ko asweekaar nahin kiya, lekin san 1534 main unhone swayan ko carch of england kaa sarvocch pramukh ghoshit kar diya
 As a result of this act and subsequent acts, a separate Church called the Church of England eventually came into existence
 henry or unke salaahkaaron ko lag ki pope dharmanirpeksh maamalon main shaamil ek italvi rajkumaar kii tarah kaary kar rahe the, jisase unki dharmik bhoomika aspasht ban gai thi
 He said that Rome's dealings with England resembled that of a minor stepchild, giving him only one cardinal position out of fifty, and there was no possibility of that cardinal becoming pope
 rajya ke kaarnon ke chalate henry ke liye yah lagaataar asahneeya hota gaya ki england ke pramukh nirnay italvi logon dwaara nipataae ja rahe the
 The divorce issue presented an example of this problem, but the issue itself was not the cause of the problem
 ek nai patni or ek uttaradhikari kii unki ichha kii tulana main henry dwaara kiye gayi english carch ke sudhaar main adhik jatil uddeshy va vidhiyaan shaamil thim
 Henry insisted that his first marriage had never been valid, but the issue of divorce was only a factor in Henry's desire to reform the church
 san 1532-37 main, unhone anek kanoon lagu kiye-apil kaa adhinium, uttaradhikaar ke vibhinn adhinium, pratham sarvocchata kaa adhinium, va anya-jo raja tathaa pope ke bich sambandhon va carch of england kii sanrachana se sambandhit the
 During these years as part of his efforts to reform the church, Henry suppressed the shrines located in the monasteries and pilgrimages

 Questions pertaining to true faith were resolved with the adoption of the Orthodox "act of Six Articles" and a vigilant control of synergies between the extreme groups after 1540

 The new political theology of obeying the prince's orders was decisive for Henry's reforms, enthusiastically adopted by the Church of England in the 1530s
 yah chauthe dharmadesh kii martin luther kii nai vyakhya ko pratibimbit karata tha or ise angrez darshakon ke bich prastut karne main wiliam tindel ne madhyasthata kii
 The establishment of royal authority over the Ten Commandments and thus the Word of God was a particularly attractive feature of this doctrine, which became the defining feature of the religion established by Henry
 carch of england ke bheetar pratispardhi pravritiyon ne unke vishisht kaaryakramon kii purti ke prayaas main iskaa durupyog karne kii koshishen kii
 The Reformers attempted to preserve Luther's connection with the more comprehensive framework of theology and focused only on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasized good works, events, and philanthropy
 sudhaarkon ne shahi shreshthata or ishwar ke vachan ko jodakar henry ko san 1539 main great bible, ek angrezi anuwaad, jo unke dwaara nav-sthapit oopaadhi ke liye ek durjey avlamb tha, prakashit karne ke liye uksaaya
 There was mixed response to the reforms

 This was the only real threat to the security of Henry's crown during his entire reign

 Elsewhere, these changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic customs remained sober or left in secret

 Mary Boleyn was his girlfriend before Henry made Anne his second wife
 aisa mana jaataa he ki san 1519 or 1526 ke bich kisi samay vah catherine kii daasi rahi thi
 There has been speculation that the father of Mary's two children, Catherine and Henry, was Henry, but this has never been proved and the king never accepted him as he did to Henry Fitzroy

 In 1525, Henry became more distraught and enamored of Ann Boleyn, a charismatic young woman, one of the queen's attendants
 prarambh main en ne use bahakaane ke henry ke prayaason kaa virodh kiya or unki premika bananaa asweekaar kar diya, jaisi uski bahan mairi boleen rahi thi
 He said, "your Excellency, with folded hands, i humbly ask you to leave me and my answer is for good intentions
" apni eemaandaaree kaa tyaag karne ke bajaay main apane jivan kaa tyaag kar duungi"
 This refusal attracted Henry more and they continued to try to get him
 antat en ne henry ke moh main apane liye ek avasar dekha or ve is baat par ad gayi ki ve keval england kii sweekrut rani ke rup main hi unka aalingan karengi
 For this it was necessary to remove Catherine from the post of queen
 jald hi yah raja kii teevr ichha ban gai ki catherine ke saath unke vivaah ko nirast kiya jaae
 Henry directly prayed to the Holy See without telling Cardinal Thomas Woolsey, from whom he had kept his plans for Ann secret
 iske bajaay, vivaah ke nirastikaran kaa nivedan karne ke liye henry ke sachiv, wiliam nite, ko pope clement saptam ke paas bheja gaya
 The basis for this was that Pope Julius ii's order was obtained by false pretenses because Catherine's brief marriage to the unhealthy Arthur had also resulted in physical relations between them
 henry ne prarthana kii ki vivaah ke nirastikaran kii sthiti main unhen kisi bhi mahila se punah vivaah karne kii anumati di jaae, bhale hi vah sambandh kii pratham shrenee main aati ho or chaahe vah sambandh vaid athwa avaidh rishte ke dwaara bana ho
 This was clearly in reference to Ann Boleyn
 haalanki, chunki us samay catherine ke bhai, samraat charles pancham, dwaara pope ko bandi bana liya gaya tha, atah un tak pahunch paanaa nite ke liye kathin tha or ve keval nae vivaah ke liye sashart chhot hi praapt kar sake
 Now Henry had no choice but to hand over the issue to Wolsey
 is nirnay ko raja ke paksh main surakshit karne ke liye woolsi jo kuch bhi kar sakate the vah unhone kiya, yahaan tak ki unhone ek carch sambandhi nyaayalay kii england main sunwaayee sabha bhi yojit kii jisamen pope kaa ek pratinidhi bhi shaamil tha
 The fourth scene of the second part of Shakespeare's play, Henry VIII, accurately records Catherine's awe-inspiring adventure of Eragon in that remarkable court
 vah, ek durjey or spashtatah galat samajhi gai mahila, jhukkar henry ko pranaam karti he, swayan ko uski dayaa par chhod detii he, niruttar kar dene vaali vakpatutaa ke saath apni baat kahati he or tezi se us adaalat ke kamare se baahar nikal jaati he
 Although, mostly, this moment turned the people present there and the rest of the world in his favor, the Pope had never intended to empower his representative
 charles pancham ne apni chachee ke vivaah ke nirastikaran kaa virodh kiya, lekin yah spasht nahin he ki pope par iskaa kitna prabhaav padaa
 parantu yah spasht he ki henry ne dekha ki samraat kii chachee se hue vivaah ke liye unhen pope dwaara nirastikaran diya janaa asambhavit tha
 The pope prohibited Henry from marrying a new marriage until a decision was delivered in the court of Rome, not in England
 is nirastikaran ke liye woolsi ko zimmedaar tehraaya gaya
 Woolsey was a Catholic while Ann was a Protestant-minded Christian and wanted to remove Catholics who held key positions to promote the reformist movement in England
 en boleen ne henry par tab tak dabaav banaae rakhaa jab tak ki san 1529 main woolsi ko saarvajanik pad se barkhaast na kar diya gaya
 Upon being sacked, the cardinal pleads with him to assist him to return to the post but Ann refuses
 tab usne en ko nirvaasan ke liye baadhya kiye jane kii yojana par kaary karnaa shuru kiya or iske liye rani catherine va pope se sampark karnaa prarambh kar diya
 When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest and if he had not died due to illness in 1530, he might have been hanged for treason
 unke sthaan par aaye sar thomas mor ne prarambh main raja kii nai niti ke saath sahyog karte hue sansad main woolsi kii ninda kii or oxford va cambridge ke dharamshasreiyon ke is mat kaa samarthan kiya ki catherine ke saath henry kaa vivaah gairqanoonee tha
 When Henry, under the influence of Anne, began to reject the authority of the Pope and to promote reformist movements, the peacock of the Catholic faith increased
 ek varsh baad, rani catherine ko darbar se nikaal diya gaya or uske puraane kaksh en ko de diye gaye
 Due to the absence of Woolsey, Ann had substantial power in political matters
 apane samay ke lihaaj se vah ek asaamaanya rup se shikshit va budhimaan mahila thi or vah protestant sudhaaron ke vichaaron ke prati atyadhik tallin or sammilit thi
 When Archbishop William Warham of Canterbury died, Ann appointed Chaplin of the Boleyn family, Thomas Cranmer, to this vacant position
 france ke raja ke hastkshep ke madhyam se, rome dwaara ise manyata de di gai or clement ne unhen aadhikarik vasr pradaan kiya
 The task of breaking the power of Rome in England gradually progressed

 Following these laws, Thomas More resigned from his post as Chancellor and Cromwell became Henry's chief minister

 Soon after returning to Dover, England, Henry and Annie were secretly married

 On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void, ruling in a special court held in Dunstable Priory to decide on the legality of the king's marriage to Catherine of Aragon
 paanch dinon baad, 28 may 1533 ko cranmar ne ghoshnaa kii ki henry va en kaa vivaah vaid tha
 The Queen's title was formally stripped from Catherine, and on 1 June 1533 Ann was crowned Queen
 7 sitambar 1533 ko rani ne, samay se kuch pehle, ek putree ko janm diya
 The daughter was named Elizabeth in honor of Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York

 Princess Mary, the daughter of Catherine, was declared invalid and Ann's offspring were announced to be next in line of succession

 HSV infection causes several specific medical disorders
 twachaa yaa mucosa kaa saamaanya sankraman chehre or mukh, janendriya, yaa haathon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 More severe disorder occurs when the virus infects the eye, damages it, or damages the brain and attacks the central nervous system
 Patients with immature or suppressed immune systems, such as newborns, transplant recipients, or AIDS patients, are likely to have serious complications from HSV infection

 However, since HSV can be detected in these ganglia in a much larger number of people who have never suffered facial paralysis and in hsv-infected individuals with Bell's paralysis than HSV without the condition
 High titers of antibodies are not found, which is why this theory has been controversial

 The only way to get the herpes simplex virus 2 is through direct skin-to-skin contact of an infected person
 ek nae vyakti ko sankramit karne ke liye, echesavi munh yaa janaanangi kshetron kii twachaa yaa shleshm jhilliyon ke chote-chote chhidron se hokar gujarata he
 Even microscopic scratches of synovial membranes are sufficient for viruses to enter
 echesavi sparshonmukh bahaav kabhi-kabhi parisarp se sankramit adhikansh vyaktiyon main hota he
 It can occur more than a week or more after an asymptomatic recurrence in 50 percent of cases
 jin sankramit logon main koi lakshan nahin dikhaai detaa he, ve tab bhi apni twachaa ke madhyam se vishaanu kaa bahaav yaa sancharan kar sakate hai; sparshonmukh bahaav echesavi-2 sancharan ke sabase aam prakaar ko pradarshit kar saktaa he
 Asymptomatic shedding occurs several times within the first 12 months of acquiring HSV
 echivi kaa samavarti sankraman sparshonmukh bahaav kii aavriti or avadhi ko badha detaa he
 There have been indications that there may be very little such flow in some people, but evidence suggests that this has not been fully verified; No variation in the frequency of asymptomatic shedding has been observed when people with twelve repetitions in the year of comparison are compared to those with no recurrence
 jo antibody praarambhik sankraman ke baad ek prakaar kii echesavi ko viksit karata he, ve usee prakaar ke vishaanu se hone vaale punah sankraman kii rokthaam karata he - echesavi-1 ke kaaran hone vaale orophacial sankraman ke itihaas vaala vyakti echesavi-1 ke kaaran hone vaale parisarp bisahari yaa janangi sankraman ko praapt nahin kar saktaa he
 In a monogamous couple, a seronegative woman has a greater than 30% risk of acquiring HSV infection per year compared to a seropositive male partner

 Primary orofacial herpes is immediately identified through a clinical examination of individuals who have never suffered a wound and who have ever come in contact with someone with a known HSV-1 infection
 aam taur par in logon main ghaavon kii upasthiti or vitaran ekaadhik, gol, satahi maukhik alceron ke rup main saamne aata he jiske saath-saath masoodon main teevr sujan bhi ho jaataa he
 Adults who do not have this common form are more difficult to identify their diseases
 purv lakshan jo dada ghaavon ke saamne aane se pehle nazar aate hai, ve echesavi ke lakshanon ko allergy sambandhi stomatitis jaise anya vikaron ek ek jaise dikhne vaale lakshanon main antar sthapit karne main madad karte hai
 When lesions do not appear in the mouth, primary orofacial herpes is sometimes mistaken for impetigo, a bacterial infection
 munh main hone vaale aam ghaav bhi intramaukhik parisarp jaise hi lagate hai, lekin inamen koi vesicular charan maujuud nahin hota he
 Genital herpes may be more difficult to identify than oral herpes because most hsv-2-infected individuals have no conventional symptoms
 iske alaava rog kii pahchaan main bhram hone kii vajah se kai anya sthitiyaan jananaangi parisarp jaise lagate hai jisamen lichen planes, atopic tvchashodh or urethritis shaamil hai
 Laboratory tests are often used to confirm the identity of genital herpes
 prayogshaala pareekshanon main shaamil hai: vishaanu kaa sanvardhan, vishaanu kaa pataa lagane ke liye diarect floricent antibody ) ke adhyayan, twachaa biopsy or vishaanujanit diene kii upasthiti ke pareekshan ke liye polimeres chen riection )

 The virus cannot pass through latex condoms, but nevertheless the effectiveness of condoms is limited because it does not prevent skin contact with all areas or contact with bodily fluids that cover the scrotum, anus, hips
 , Are the immediate vicinity of the upper thighs or penis, all of which have a high probability of infection or transmission of the virus
 ek condom dhaaran karne ke alaava yon sampark ke dauraan in kshetron ke saath hone vaale sampark kii rokthaam ke madhyam se saidhantik taur par parisarp ke viruddh behatar suraksha pradaan kiya janaa chahie
 Boxers shorts such as dresses or undergarments that cover these susceptible areas but still help infiltrate the genitals through a small piercing should prevent transmission and infection
 condom yaa danta baandhon kaa prayog bhi maukhik sex ke dauraan ek saathi se duusare saathi ko jananaangon se parisarp ke sancharan ko simit karata he
 When one partner has a simple herpes infection and the other partner does not, antiviral therapy with condoms, such as the use of valacyclovir, further reduces the likelihood of transmission to the uninfected partner
 samayik microbiside jinamein rasinic tatv hote hai jo vishaanu ko pratyaksh rup se niskriy kar dete hai or vishaanujanit pravishti ko roak detaa he, unki jaanch kii ja rahi he

 jab yah viksit ho jayega, tab ise praarambhik sankramanon kii rokthaam karne yaa kam karne ke saath-saath maujuuda sankraman ke ilaaj main madad karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Like almost all sexually transmitted infections, women are more likely to enter genital HSV-2 than men
 ek vaarshik aadhaar par, vishaanu-virdohi yaa condom ke upyog ke bina sankramit purush se mahila main echesavi-2 ke sancharan kaa jokhim lagbhag 8-10% he
 It is believed to be due to the increased openness of the mucous tissue at potential infection sites
 sankramit mahila se purush main sancharan kaa jokhim lagbhag 4-5% prati varsh he
 Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by up to 50%
 vishaanu-virdohi tatv sankraman paridrishyon main rogasuchak echesavi ke vikaas kii lagbhag 50% tak rokthaam karne main bhi madad karata he - jiskaa matlab he ki sankramit saathi seropusitive hi nahin balki lakshan-mukt bhi hoga
 Condom use also reduces the risk of transmission by up to 50%
 condom kaa istemaal purush se mahila main hone vaale sancharan kii rokthaam karne main iske vipareet kram kii apeksha bahut adhik prabhaavshaalee hota he
 The combination of antiviral and condom effects is almost additive, thus resulting in a combined reduction of approximately 75% in annual transmission risk

 Subjects with low recurrence rates and subjects with no clinical manifestations were excluded from these studies
 maa se bachche ko sankraman kaa khatra sabase zyada he agar maa prasav ke samay sankramit ho jaati he, lekin jokhim kam hokar 3 fisadi ho jaataa he yadi yah ek aavarti sankraman ho or 1 fisadi se bhi kam ho jaataa he yadi koi drashtavy ghaav na ho
 To prevent newborn infections, seronegative women are advised to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1 seropositive partner during the last trimester of pregnancy and to establish traditional sexual contact with a partner suffering from genital infection
 She goes
 jo seronegative maa is samay echesavi praapt karti he usase prasav ke dauraan uske bachche main sankraman ke pahunchane kii sambhaavna 57 fisadi hoti he, kyonki bachche ke janm se pehle rakshaatmak matra antibody ko laane or hastantarit karne ke liye aparyaapt samay milegaa, jabaki ek mahila jo echesavi-1 or echesavi-2 donon ke liye seropusitive hoti he, usamen apane shishu main sankraman ke sancharan kii sambhaavna 1 se 3 fisadi ke aasapaas hota he
 Like HSV-2, HSV-1 transmitted by oral sex is not very common but it always carries risks

 Numerous studies on humans and mice have evidence that early treatment with famciclovir immediately after the first infection of herpes can significantly reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks of herpes
 famcyclovir ke jald upyog se yah sabit ho gaya he ki yah tantrika sambandhi gangliya main avyakt vishaanu kii maatr ko kam karne main sahaayak he
 On reviewing them using 250 mg of famciclovir three times a day for five days during the first case of herpes in humans, it was found that only 4
2 percent of people recurred within six months after the first outbreak, which was acyclovir
 Was five times lower than 19 percent recurrence in patients treated with the help of
 in aashajanak parinaam ke baavjood, is yaa samaan khuraaq vaali vyavastha main parisarp ke liye kiya jane vaale praarambhik famcyclovir upachaar ko abhi bhi mukhya rup se apnaanaa baaki he
 As a result, some doctors and patients have opted for off-label use

 bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga ki desh main lagbhag sabhi nami dawa companiyaan branded ke saath-saath kam keemat vaali generik dawaaen bhi banaati hai lekin zyada laabh ke chakkar main doctor or companiyaan logon ko is bare main kuch bataate nahin hai or jaankaree ke abhaav main garib bhi chemist se mahangi dawaaen kharidne ko vivash hai
 It is worth noting that after all the research for a single disease, it is recommended to give a chemical compound as a special medicine
 is yogic ko alag-alag companiyaan alag-alag naamon se bechati hai
 An expert committee determines the name of the generic drug based on the name of the active compound present in it
 kisi bhi dawa kaa generik naam puure vishwa main ek hi hota he
 Generic medicines are made and distributed without any patents, ie, the formulation of the generic drug may be patented but its contents cannot be patented
 antarrashtriya maanakon se bani generik dawaaiyon kii gunvattta branded dawaaiyon se kam nahin hoti, jinaki aapurti duniyabar main bhi kii jaati he or yah bhi utana hi asar karti hai jitna branded dawaaen karti hai
 Their dosage, side-effects, ingredients etc
 are exactly the same as all branded medicines
 udhaaharan ke liye purushon main irectile disfunction ke ilaaj ke liye sildenphil naam kii generik dawa hoti he jise fizer company viagara naam se bechati he
 Generic medicines also have to undergo all strict procedures of quality standards before being licensed to market
 in dawaaon ke prachaar-prasar par companiyaan kuch kharch nahin karti
 Generic drugs have government restrictions on pricing, so they are cheaper, while companies price patented drugs themselves, so they are expensive
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan kaa kahana he ki yadi doctor marij ko generik dawaaiyon kii salaah dene lagen to keval dhani deshon main chikitsa vyay par 70 pratishat tak kami aa jaayegi tathaa garib deshon ke chikitsa vyay main yah kami or bhi zyada hogi
 At times, there is a difference of up to ninety percent in the prices of branded and generic drugs
 jaise yadi branded dawaai kii 14 goliyon kaa ek patta 786 rupee kaa he, to ek goli kii keemat kareeb 55 rupee hui
 a leaf of 10 tablets of the same generic drug is available for just Rs 59, that is, one tablet will be available for only Rs 6
 khaas baat yah he ki kidney, urine, bern, dil sambandhi rog, neurology, diabetes jaisi bimariyon main to branded va generik dawa kii keemat main bahut hi zyada antar dekhne ko miltaa he
 Pharmaceutical companies make huge profits from branded medicine
 dawaaon kii companiyaan apane medical riprogentatica ke jariye doctoron ko apni branded dawa likhane ke liye khaase laabh detii hai
 On this basis, medicine is supplied to the nearest medical store
 yahi vajah he ki branded dawaaon kaa kaarobaar din prati din badhata ja rahaa he
 This is the reason why doctors do not prescribe generic medicine at all
 jaankaree hone par koi vyakti agar chemist kii dukaan se generik dawa maang bhi le to dawa vikreta inaki uplabdhta se inkaar kar dete hai
 Most of the big cities of the country have exclusive generic medical stores, but due to lack of wide publicity, people do not benefit from them, nowadays all kinds of information can be easily accessed through the Internet
 branded or generik dawaaon kii keemat main antar kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek mobile ap 'samaadhaan or helthcart bhi bazaar main uplabdh he
 Today, people need to know about generic medicines and especially to make the poor aware so that they do not get caught in the maze of pharmaceutical companies
 jainarik davaaiyaan branded davaaiyon kii tulana main ausatan paanch guna sasti hoti he
 The availability of generic medicines can provide a huge contribution in providing health protection to the common man and this will challenge the monopoly of branded companies in the pharmaceutical industry
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar jainarik davaaiyon ke likhe jane par keval dhani deshon main chikitsa vyay par 70 pratishat tak kami aa jaayegi tathaa garib deshon ke chikitsa vyay main yah kami or bhi zyada hogi
 Generic medicines reach the manufacturer directly from the retailer
 in dawaaon ke prachaar-prasar par companiyon ko kuch kharch nahin karnaa padataa
 The price of patents and generic drugs of the same company varies greatly
 chunki generik dawaaon ke mulya nirdhaaran par sarkari ankush hota he, at: ve sasti hoti hai, jabaki patent dawaaon kii keemat companiyaan khud tay karti hai, isliye ve mahangi hoti hai
 For example, if the doctor has prescribed the drug 'glycave' brand for a patient of blood cancer, then the cost of the month-long course will be Rs 1,14,400, whereas the cost of the month-long course of the other brand 'vineet' of the same drug
 11,400 would be relatively low

 Often, the Kalasangralaya has been used for the Chitrashala, but for this the picture museum or the Chitrashala is a more appropriate term and it is more popular
 chitrashalas do prakaar kii ho sakati hai- saarvajanik or vyaktigat
 The Chitrashala is often a showcase of the artists' own creations
 aadhunik kaal ke purv rajmahalon main bhi chitrashalas hoti thim
 Religious paintings and idols were also displayed in temples and churches
 ajanta, ellora, baagh, sigriya ityadi tathaa misr, china, lanka or europe main tamaam dharmik bhawan tathaa girjaghar dharmik chitrashalas hai
 In ancient times, famous artists used to make paintings on the walls and roofs of temples, churches, religious buildings
 bharat main ajanta aisi hi ek ati pracheen chitrashaala he
 Mythological or religious paintings are found on the walls of medieval Indian temples
 us samay ke rajaprasaadon ke deevaaron par bane chitra dekhe ja sakate hai
 Even today the walls of temples are painted and painted
 vartmaal kaal main dhani maani vyaktiyon or suruchisampann nagarikon dwaara prasiddh kalakaaron ke chitra sangrahit kiye jate hai
 Most of the art museums are those which also have paintings, but there are also those which cannot have pictures
 yah maatr aitihaasik mahatv kii, durlabh or vilakshan vastuon kaa puraatatv sangrahalay bhi ho saktaa he
 Now, museums of science, history, geography, even literature etc
 are being started in which the subjects related to it are historically enlightening, bizarre, rare and a collection of useful items
 pehle europe tathaa anya paashchaatya deshon ke adhiktar sangrahalayon main chitrashalas bhi hoti thim
 Even today, most of the paintings around the world are part of museums
 kintu swatantra chitrashalas tathaa chitra kalavithiyaan bhi nirmit ho gai hai
 The materials displayed in art museums are sourced or provided
 ye kalasangraahakon tathaa kala marmagyon dwaara praapt hoti rahi hai
 The tendency to collect and display such items for study and protection is universal
 angreji kaa museum shabd, jiske hindi paryaay sangrahalay, kalasangrahalay, kalakaksh aadi hai, mujes se bana he
 Muse means the Gotha or arts to the presiding deity
 greek bhashaa main "musian" us smarak ko kehete the jo greek puraanon kii mujes ko arpit hota tha
 a part of the palaces of the Ptolemy kings in Cincardia and Egypt before the third century BC, which housed the contents of Alexander the Great's library, was called the "museian"
 use vidyabhavan bhi kehete the1 yadhyapi us samay kala samagriyon ke sangrah ko museum nahin kehete the tathaapi uskaa taatpary sangrahalay hota tha or use gnanarjan kaa saadhan samajha jaataa tha
 Similarly, the museums of medieval churches were considered as a source of spiritual and artistic inspiration
 girjagharon kii deevaaron, khidakiyon tathaa chhaton par bhi dharmik kathaon kaa chitrankan tathaa alankaran hota tha or usase jansadharan ko shiksha milti thi
 St
 Mark in Venice, the Church of Hell, Germany and Paris, the Gallery of Apollo in Louvre are art museums of the same kind
 16 veen shatabdi main italy main "musian" shabd ke sthaan par "mujeeyon" kaa prayog hua
 The princes of Renaissance Italy and the rich people of the royal family instilled a sense of collection and display of artistic materials and started decorating them in the rooms
 inamen florence kaa madosi rajgharaana, maantua kaa gonjagaa parivaar, farera rajgharaana, urbino kaa montefeltro tathaa goobio rajgaraane is prakaar ke kalatmak sangrahalay ke sangrakshan ke liye prasiddh hai or yaheen se musium kaa mahatv aarambh ho jaataa he
 Later, scholars also felt the passion for the selection, compilation and collection of paintings and artistic materials
 punarjagarankalin italvi "muzeo" main adhiktar aayu kii bani kalatmak vastuen, jais medal, tamrapatticas, mahaan, logon ke utkeern vyakticitra athwa vastuchitra hi hote the1 inamen bade bade dharmik kathachitron ke rakhane ke liye paryaapt sthaan nahin hota tha
 They had to be kept in long galleries
 16veen shatabdi tak aise chitron ke liye vishesh rup se rajmahalon main kalavithiyaan banavaane kii pratha chal padi or tabhi se chitrashaala sa ""artgelaree"" kaa rup spasht hone laga
 Sebaschiano Cerlio was the first to emphasize the importance of such special galleries in the 16th century
 san 1581 main barnado bontalenti ne aisi hi ek suniyojit vithi florence main euphizo rajmahal kii upree manzil main banavaai thi jo aaj bhi vikhyath he
 Later, the practice of making this type of painting started in other royal houses of Europe
 france kii kranti ke pashchaat kalasangrahalay yaa chitravithi keval rajgharaanon kaa shauk na hokar jansadharan kii shiksha tathaa manoranjan kaa saadhan bani or isaki vyavastha tathaa sangrakshan kaa kaary ek nishchit yojana ke aadhaar par hone laga
 Later, attention was paid to the classification of the stored artistic objects and paintings and they were placed in different categories according to the order of creation and decorated in different rooms
 is prakaar chitrashalas puraani panraparaaon, saamaajik jivan, reeti rivaaj, samskruti tathaa sabhyataa ke adhyayan kaa centre ban gai
 After the French State Revolution, the artistic materials of the kingdoms were divided among various people
 tab tak landan main kalatmak vastuon ke sangrah kii pratha joro se chal padi thi
 As a result, many valuable and exquisite works of art from France were sold in the markets of London and Europe
 ise rokane ke liye france sarkaar ne rajkeey sangrahalay tathaa chitrashaala kii yojana banaai taaki desh kii anupam kalakritiyon ko rashtriya nidhi ke rup main surakshit rakhaa ja sake
 With this in view, a commission was set up there under the leadership of Alicjande Lenoa and the first national museum was established called "muje National de Manuments Française"
 tatpashchaat sansar ke anya pragatisheel deshon main bhi rashtriya sangrahalay tathaa chitrashalas sthapit hone lageen
 Initially, the famous artistic palaces of ancient times were chosen for the art museum
 isprakaar ke sangrahalayon main luvr, lakjemburg, skuni tathaa karnavelette, belvidir ityadi prasiddh hai
 Many Indian cities like Jaipur House in Delhi and Baroda, Hyderabad etc
 have such museums
 america main isabela, stuart gardenor sangrahalay prasiddh hai
 All the old palaces in Russia and China have also been converted into museums
 19veen shatabdi main adhiktar dumanjile sangrahalay banaae gaye or bhawan aavashyaktaanusaar kaayade se sundar dhang se banaae jane lage
 In the modern period, very impressive paintings were built in a very strange way
 neuyark main arupavaadi chitrakala kaa sangrahalay bana jo apane dhang kaa adbhut he
 In the construction of an art museum, it is always noted that the building should be constructed in such a way that the viewer respectively comes out from one side to the other and nothing is left undiscovered
 isiliye shuru main golakaar kalasangrahalay banane kaa bhi prachlan hua
 In Paris, Paul Nelson designed similar museum buildings
 sangrahalay main golakaar paryaton kii vyavastha aaj bhi acchhee samajhi jaati he
 Such famous museums are worth visiting Berlin, Munich, British Museum, National Gallery of London, Dresden Museum, Vienna and Marseille Museum
 ab to sabhi deshon main is prakaar ke anek sangrahalay ban gaye hai
 The first attempt to establish a National Gallery began after the French Revolution
 france main nepolian ne sarvapratham ek puraane rajmahal luvr main rashtriya chitrashaala sthapit karwaai jise baad main "muje nepolian" bhi kaha gaya
 Some of the artistic material that Napoleon had available in his European invasions was kept in this museum
 is prakaar pehali baar saadhaaran janata ko ek hi bhawan main sansar bhar kii utkrisht kalatmak saamagree dekhne ko mili
 Napoleon provided the best artistic materials from various countries
 yah baat un deshon ko bahut hi khatkati thi
 That is why later all the countries tried to return their looted artistic items
 isi prayaas se unhen apane yahan bhi rashtriya kalasangrahalay sthapit karne kii prerana mili
 Earlier museums used to contain materials of personal interest of the Samatas and the kings
 kintu jab rashtriyan sangrahalay banane lage tab logon kaa dhyaan is ore bhi gaya ki sari kalatmak saamagree ko aitihaasik, saanskrithik tathaa saamaajik drushti se is prakar vargeekrut kiya jaay ki unke sahaj vikascram kaa pataa chal sake
 Christian Vann Michel, director of artistic materials in Vienna, first decorated the National Museum in this manner and this practice followed
 falat: landan, berlin munich tathaa anya kai nagaron main is prakaar ke rashtriya sangrahalay bane
 The planned museum gradually developed into the 19th century
 england main victoria tathaa albert sangrahalay bade hi suniyojit dhang se har prakaar kii kala ko unke vikascram se sajaayaa taaki unka vaigyanik dhang se adhyayan kiya ja sake
 All the artistic materials from prehistoric times to the east and west were arranged in sequence
 yahan tak ki adivaasiyon kii kala tathaa lokkala ko bhi unke vikascram se pradarshit kiya jane laga
 The museum thus became a science of its own and continued to progress
 sangrahalay ke liye visheshgy taiyaar hone lage jinhen "curator" kaha jaataa he
 Experts initially divided them into four departments to further refine the museum - kala se sambandhit sangrahalay ke antargat hi chitrashaala yaa art gailaree aati he
 Museum buildings have begun to become more scientific in the 20th century
 chitrashalas kalaatmak saamagree ke anuroop nirmit kii jane lagi hai taaki dekhne or samajhane main suvidha ho
 Artefacts of various periods, buildings like the period, are decorated and decorated
 yahan tak ki chitron ke pramaan ke anuroop unke liye bhawan banaae jate hai or unhen dekhne ke liye kam yaa adhik prakaash kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 Lighting is an important requirement for museums
 ab to sangrahalay ke saath saath vyaakhyaanakaksh, pustkaalay, parivartaneey pradarshneekaksh, adhyayankaksh, adhyapanakaksh, udhaar di janevaali samagriyon kaa bhawan, udhaar mangaai gai kalakritiyon kaa bhawan, aadhunik chitrakala kaksh ityadi tamaam chijen judati ja rahi hai
 Gradually the museum is becoming so big that the viewer's mind is getting bored
 isiliye ab isapar vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa he ki kalasangrahalay kaa vaataavaran adhik adhik ruchikar banaaya jaay
 Different rooms have different textures, they are painted in different colors, have different shapes, they are made attractive by garden gardens, display screens and other interesting materials
 samagriyon kii pustakaakaar suchi darshakon ko di jaati he taaki ve unase parichit ho saken
 Most of the good French paintings are in Paris
 paris main luvr sansar kii utkrishtatam chitrashaala maani jaati he
 From time to time, it has received valuable artifacts from individual collectors and thus has become a very rich gallery
 san 1900 main world fere ke silsile main jo rajmahal tathaa imaaraten uplabdh hui thim unheen main adhiktar kalasamagriyan rakhi gai
 Later, the most important materials of all places were placed in the Louvre
 nai chitrashaalaon ke liye bhi upyukt bhawan banawaye gaye, jaise pales du shailot
 a separate "mujédern National d'art" was created for modern painting
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke baad deejon, lee haavarey, leone, nise, rime ityadi main bhi nae sangrahalay bane or aadhunik vidhi se unhen sanyojit kiya gaya

 The efforts of Benjamin Silliman led to the emergence of paintings in the United States

 Until the turn of the 20th century, most of the paintings in Europe continued to be established in the same manner, on the old pattern
 germany main bhi adhiktar chitrashaalaon kii yahi sthiti thi
 But in the early 20th century, under the leadership of Wilhelm van Bode, there was a lot of change in Berlin's museums
 unhen adhik se adhik vyapak banaaya jane laga
 Among them, the art of Europe, America and Eastern countries were also given proper place
 bode ke prayaas se chitrashalas vaigyanik dhang se sajaai jane lageen
 His manner of performance gained international recognition
 duusare mahayuddh ke baad berlin kii chitrashaalaon kii saamagree purv or pashchim, do bhaagon main bant gai or unki visheshta nasht ho gai
 Nevertheless, some important pieces of German art such as the galleries of Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cassell, Stuttgart and Nuremberg are very important
 aadhunik chitrakala kii drushti se isan kaa phokwang sangrahalay bahut hi mahatvapurn he

 Federalism is the model of the trend of constitutional governance under which various states establish a union by a contract
 is sanvida ke anusaar ek sangheey sarkaar evam anek rajya sarkarein sangh kii vibhinn ikaiyaan ho jaati hai
 In general, the division of sovereignty between the federal and state governments is mentioned in their constitution which finally ratifies that contract
 saadharantaya sangheey sarkaar ko aise kaaryon ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar diya jaataa he jinhen kshetravistaar kharchila athwa duruh hone ke kaaran rajya swayan chalaane main kathinaayee prathit karte hai
 Therefore, they all seem to be units to run these tasks
 at: in kaaryon ke chalaane ke liye ve sab ikaiyaan apni rajshaktiyon kaa ek nishchit bhaag sangheey sarkaar ko adhikaar evam saadhan ke rup main pradaan kar dete hai
 In the remaining other subjects, the states themselves bear the workload and provide their counterparts as rights and means
 shesh anya vishyon main rajya swayan kaarybhaar vahan karte hai evam uske praturup adhikaar evam saadhan samvidhan dwaara lete hai

 kintu bhartiya sanghatmak samvidhan main kuch vishisht pravidhan he jinka samavesh anya samvidhanon ke kaarysanchalan se utpann kathinaaiyon ko drushtigat karke kiya gaya he
 For example, the most specific fact is that the Indian constitution, despite being federal, is not formed by any contract of independent nations; Rather it is made up of a combination of state units that were already in place as part of an independent unitary India
 duusari visheshta yah he ki aaptkaal main bhartiya samvidhan main ekaatmak samvidhanon ke anuroop centre ko adhik shaktishaalee banane ke liye praavdhaan nihit hai
 The third feature is that only one citizenship is included and the same constitution provides for the functioning of both the Central and State Governments

 prakaashiki jyamitiya prakaashiki kaa vah bhaag he jo prakaash ko 'kiran' jaisaa maanakar uski gati kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is why it is also called 'ray optics'
 kiran prakaashiki kii manyata ke anusaar jab tak samaangi madhyam main prakaash gati karata he tab tak uskaa maarg sidhi rekha main hota he
 Where two mediums meet, the light rays turn there vastutah prakaashiki kaa badi seemaa tak sarleekaran hi jyamitiya prakaashiki he
 No explanation can be given of the diffraction and interference of light under geometric optics
 kintu jyamitiya prakaashiki chhabiyon ke nirmaan evam prakaashik vipatham aadi kii vyakhya karne main sakasham he
 In other words, with geometric optics the results are pure as long as the size of the objects is much larger than the wavelength of the light
 jyamitiya prakaashiki, prakaashiki kaa vah ang he jisamen prakaash kii kirnon kii jyamiti tathaa prakashkeey tantra dwaara pratibimb-nirmaan-prakriya kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It contains the description of the properties of optical devices and the lenses, lenses,] mirrors and contours through which optical instruments are made
 yah sugyaat tathy he ki prakaash kii kirane saral rekha main gaman karti hai
 This property of theirs is called the non-linear transmission of light
 jis padaarth se hokar prakaash kii kirane guzarati hai, use 'madhyam' kehete hai
 When rays of light travel through some medium and reach another medium, there are three actions: prakaash kii kirnon kaa kuch, yaa adhik, bhaag donon madhyamon ke vibhaajak tal se pehle hi madhyam main waapas lautaa diya jaataa he
 This action is called reflection
 prakaash kii kirnon kaa kuch bhaag vibhaajak tal par avashoshit ho jaataa he
 And prakaash kii kirnon kaa shesh bhaag duusare madhyam main chalaa jaataa he
 This action is called refraction
 jyamitiya prakaashiki kuch saral manyataon par aadhaarit he
 They are - samang madhyam main prakaash kii kirane saral rekha main chalatin hai
 Law of independent distribution of light rays paravartan kaa niyam Law of refraction prakashpunj kii utkramgati kaa niyam - iske anusaar, kisi prakaash punj kii gati ko, uski aage kii taraf kii gati ke thik vipareet disha main gati karte hue bhi mana jaataa he
 Rays of light follow certain rules during reflection and refraction processes
 paravartan sambandhi niyam nimnlikhit he : 1
 The incident ray, the normal and reflected rays placed at the incident point in the dividing plane, all three are located in the same plane
 apati evam paravartit kirane abhilamb ke paraspar vipareet ore sthit hoti hai or The angle of incidence and reflection are equal
 <i=<r Following are the rules of refraction: 1
 apati kiran, vibhaajak tal main aapatan bindu par daalaa gaya abhilamb evam apavartit kiran, teenon ek hi tal main sthit hote hai
 2
 Emergent and refracted rays lie opposite sides of the normal
 or Sections of incidence and incidence of refraction have a constant ratio
 is anupaat ko greek akshar mu dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he or ise pehle madhyam ke saapeksh duusare madhyam kaa apvartanaank kaha jaataa he
 == Refraction from Prism == bharatkosh praangan bharatkosh sampadakeey calendar prashnottaree purna aantarik paravartan purna aantarik paravartan purna aantarik paravartan ek prakaashiya parighatna he
 Light can always pass through a medium optically in a dense medium, but it cannot always pass through a rare medium
 jab prakaash kirane saghan madhyam se viral madhyam ke prishth par aaptit ho rahi hon or aapatan kone kranthik kone se adhik ho, tab prakaash kaa apvartan nahin hota, balki sampurna prakaash paravartit hokar usee madhyam main laut jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called 'full internal reflection'
 purna aantarik paravartan kaa ek upyogi prayog optical fibre main kiya jaataa he
 The work of optical fibers is based on the principle of complete internal reflection
 saamanyat: vyavahrut honevaale prakaashiya yantron ke apvartak tal aise parikraman tal hote hai, jinka samamiti aksh sarvanishtha hota he
 From this symmetry it becomes clear that the image of each point on the axis is formed at another point on the axis itself
 duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki sampurna aksh swayan apana hi bimb hota he
 a refractive system has a point on its axis from which rays of light emit parallel to the axis outside the refractive system and thus the image of that point is formed at infinity
 us bindu ko apvartak tantra kaa pratham focus bindu kehete hai
 The plane considered to be right angled along the axis through the first focus point is called the first focus plane
 is tal ke kisi bindu se chalanevaali kirane apvartan ke uparaant paraspar samaantar ho jaati he
 The second focus point is the point on the axis of the refractive system at which all the rays parallel to the axis from infinity converge, that is, the point at which the object of the object at infinity is formed
 is bindu se aksh ke samakonik kalpit samtal ko dwitiya focus tal kehete hai
 The cone of rays that diverge from the first focus point of a lens deviates on both surfaces of the lens
 apati kirano ko aage kii ore tathaa nirgat kirnon ko peeche kii ore badhaane par, jo pariched bindu milte hai, ve sarvanishtha tal par sthit hote hai, jise lens kaa pratham mukhya samtal kehete hai
 Twice the deviation on the two plane of the lens is equal to the same deviation of the beam on the main plane
 isi prakaar lens ke aksh ke samaantar aanevaali kirane apvartan ke uparaant dwitiya focus bindu kii ore agrasar hoti hai
 If the incident rays are extended forward and the refracted rays backward, their point of passage will be located on a plane, which is called the second principal plane
 in samatalon ke aksh ke saath pariched bindu ko kramash: pratham tathaa dwitiya mukhya bindu kehete hai
 The first focus distance and the distance of the second focus point from the second focus point are called the second focus distance
 prakaashiya yantron ke nirmaan main kai baton kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he, visheshkar yah ki kisi binduvat vastu se aanevaali sabhi kirane ek binduvat bimb par hi ekatra hon, arthath ve vipathan ke dosha se mukt hon
 For this it is necessary that the images should not have spherical and variational aberrations, otherwise the images will be deformed and instead of being made in one place many images of different colors will be formed
 in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye ek abhilakshan falan foondnaa padataa he
 After analyzing the images made by all the rays reaching the refractory plane from an object, we come to know that the object is prone to defects and deformation

 Many times the administration had provided thirty thousand small size rubber balls instead of stones, but the people of both villages used the stones instead of using the ball
 thakhaar kar prashasan ne donon gaanvon ke logon ko nadi ke donon kinaaron par pathar uplabdh karana shuru kiya tha
 But following the instructions of the Human Rights Commission in the year 2009, the Chhindwara district administration imposed Section 144 for six days in the fair area, prohibiting the throwing of stones at the Gotmar fair between Pandhurna and Savargaon
