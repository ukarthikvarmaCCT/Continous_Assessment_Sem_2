 kamaal ataturk urf mustafaa kamaal pasha ko aadhunik turki kaa nirmaataa kaha jaataa he
 The historical work that he did by turning the dice of the imperialist ruler of Turkey, Sultan Abdul Hameed II, to create a wonderful social, political and economic system, proved his name worthwhile
 kamaal pasha kaa janm 19 may san 1881 main salonika ke ek kisaan parivaar main hua tha
 His mother's name was Juvaida and father's Ali Raza
 ali raja salonika ke chungi daftar main clerk the
 His childhood name was Mustafa
 janm ke kuch varsh baad hi pita kii mrityu ho gayi
 Mata Zubaida entered the madrasa for the purpose of getting a religious education, where she got down on killing her after harassing her senior students
 maatr 11 saal kii umr main hi vah itane durdant ho gayi the ki unhen maktab se nikaalnaa padaa
 He was later admitted to the Sainik School in Monastir
 parantu vahaan bhi unka mar mitane vaala ugravadi swabhaav bana rahaa lekin sainya-shiksha main dilchaspee ke kaaran unki padhai badastoor jari rahi, usamen koi vyavdhaan nahin aayaa
 The child Mustafa was fierce but his speed in mathematics was surprising
 adhyaaapak ke blike board par sawaal likhte hi vah use munhajbani hal kar diya karata tha
 Seeing the amazing ability in it, the school's mathematics teacher Captain Mustafa Ufendi changed his name to Kamal
 uske baad hi vah kamaal pasha ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After receiving his initial military education at the primary military school in Monastir at the age of 17, he was sent to the Staff College of Kustuntunia for higher military education
 un dinon kustuntuniya main abdul hamid kii sultanate thi or uske rajiadhipati ko sultan kaha jaataa tha
 There he roamed in bad company along with studies
 kuch kaal tak uddandtapurna jivan bitaane ke baad vah vatan naamak ek gupt krantikari dal ke pehle sadsy bane or thode hi dinon baad uske netaa ho gayi
 The purpose of Vatan was to eradicate the dictatorship of the Sultan on the one hand and foreign intrigues on the other
 ek din dal kii baithak chal rahi thi ki kisi guptchar ne sultan ko khabar de di or sabake sab shadyantrakari afasar giraftaar karke jail bhej diye gayi
 According to the prevailing law, all of them could be given the death penalty, but the ill-fated Sultan feared that rebellion would not erupt in the country, so he decided to grant pardon to all
 is prakaar anya sanikon ke saath kamaal bhi kshamaadaan main chhod diye gayi
 Subsequently, the Sultan sent him to Damascus to suppress the rebellion of the Druze caste
 vahaan kamaal ne kaam to kamaal kaa hi kiya, par swabhaav ke anusaar kustantuniya waapas lautate hi unhone stambul main ek cameraa lekar vatan-o-hurriyat party kaa karyaalay kholkar usamen aazaadee kii gupt sanstha kaa kaary armbh kar diya
 Meanwhile, he came to know that there was going to be an open rebellion against the Sultan in Macedonia
 maukey kii najaakat ko bhaanpate hue kamaal ne sultan kii sena se chuttee le lee or jaafaa, miru va athens hote hue vesh badalakar vidroh ke kendra salonika ja pahunche
 But they were recognized there
 phir vah greece hote hue jaafaa kii ore bhaage
 But by then the order of his arrest had reached there too
 ahamed be naamak ek afasar par kamaal ko pakadaney kaa bhaar tha, par chunki ahamed swayan vatan kaa sadsy tha, isliye usne kamaal ko giraftaar karne ke bajaay gaja morche par bhej diya or yah sultan ko yah report bhej di ki vah chuttee par gayi hi nahin the
 Although Kamal was able to stay in Salonika for a very short time, he understood well that it would be better to make Salonika the center of rebellion, so after a lot of efforts, in 1908 he got Salonika transferred
 yahan anwar ke netritv main do saal pehle hi ekta or pragati samiti ke naam se ek krantikari dal kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 Kamal immediately became its member, but she was not made up of the leaders of the party
 phir bhi ve samiti kaa kaam nirantar karte rahe
 One leader of this party, Niazi, revolted against the Turkish government with only a few hundred men
 yadhyapi thi to yah badi morrkhtaa kii baat, parantu chunki sara desh taiyaar tha, isliye jo sena usase ladane ke liye bheji gayi thi, vah bhi anwar se ja mili
 Thus Anwar cheered in the country
 ab sah sammilit sena rajdhani par akraman karne kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 The Sultan also made some governance reforms in those days
 phir bhi vidroh kii shaktiyaan apana kaam karti raheen, par jab vidroh safal ho chukaa tab sultan abdul hamid ne sena ke kuch logon ko yathesht ghoose dekar apane saath mila liya, jisase sainikon ne vidroh karke apane afasaron ko maar daalaa or phir ek baar islam, sultan or khaliph kii jai ke naare buland hue
 Anwar was in Berlin these days
 vah jaldi hi laute or unhone abdul hamid ko gaddi se utaar kar anek pratikriyaavaadi netaaon kii phaansi par chadha diya
 In this way administrative power came into the hands of Anwar's revolutionary committee
 aam janata ko digbhramit karne ke liye sultan ke bhanje ko singhaasana par bitha diya gaya
 Here Kamaal Pasha continued to plot against Anwar because in his view Anwar was undoubtedly idealistic but more impractical
 baavjood is sabake anwar ne us samay hone vaale videshi akramanon ko ek ke baad ek lagaataar vifal kiya isse janata main anwar kii khyaati or adhik badi
 Anwar then embarked on the task of making his all-islamic dream come true and the first thing he did for it was to hand over the responsibility of organizing the Turkish army to a German general
 kamaal ne iske viruddh yah kehete hue aandolan prarambh kiya ki yah to turki jati kaa apmaan he
 On this, Kamal was sent to Sofia by making a military ambassador
 isi bich mahayuddh chhid gaya
 Anwar could not succeed in this, but Kamal thwarted the British trick of conquering Kustantunia in a battle, and then his victory continued to prevail
 phir bhi mahayuddh main turki haar gaya
 Working hard day and night, he kept agitating against foreigners
 1920 main sevra kii sandhi kii ghoshnaa hui parantu isaki sharten itani kharaab thim ki kamaal ne fouran hi ek sena taiyaar kar kustuntuniya par akraman kii taiyaari kii
 Meanwhile, Greece attacked Turkey and launched an army at Smyrna which started moving towards the great center of Angara
 ab to kamaal ke liye badi samasya paidaa ho gai, kyonki is yuddh main yadi ve haar jate to aage koi sambhaavna na rahati
 So they fought the war with great preparation, as a result of which the Greek army gradually had to retreat
 is bich france or rus ne bhi kamaal ko gupt rup se sahaayta dena shuru kiya
 In a few days the Greeks were driven out
 greekon ko bhagane ke baad hi angrejon ke haath se baaki hisse nikaalane kaa prashn tha
 The country was with them, in addition, Britain was no longer ready to fight
 is kaaran yah samasya bhi sulajh gai
 Kamal declared the country democratic and became the first President himself
 ab rajya lagbhag nishkantak ho chukaa tha, par mullaon kii ore se unka nirantar virodh ho rahaa tha
 Kamal started campaigning against Islam in government newspapers
 ab to dharmik netaaon ne unke viruddh fatve jari kar diye or yah kahana shuru kiya ki kamaal ne angora main striyon ko parde se baahar nikaal kar desh main aadhunik nrity kaa prachaar kiya he, jisamen purush striyon se satakar naachte hai, iskaa ant hona chahie
 This voice was raised from every mosque
 tab kamaal ne 1924 ke march main khilaafat pratha kaa ant kiya or turki ko dharm-nirpeksh raashtra ghoshit karte hue ek vidheyak sansad main rakhaa
 Most parliamentarians opposed it, but Kamal threatened them with a tight end
 unki is dhamkee kaa purajor asar hua or vidheyak paarit ho gaya
 But the fire of insurgency within the mullahs kept on burning
 kamaal ke kai bhootpurv saathi mullaon ke saath mil gayi the
 These people also took money from foreign capitalists
 kamaal ne ek din inke mukhya netaaon ko giraftaar kar phaansi par chadha diya
 Kamal saw that hanging only will not do, the country has to be educated modernly and not only the old customs, the dress etc
 has to be abolished
 kamaal ne pehla hamalaa turki topi par kiya
 It revolted, but Kamal sent an army
 iske baad inhone islamic kanoonon ko hataakar unke sthaan par ek nai samhita sthapit kii jisamen switzarland, germany or italy kii sab acchhee-acchhee baaten shaamil thim
 Multiple marriages were outlawed
 iske saath hi patiyon se yah kaha gaya ki ve apni patniyon ke saath dhoron kii tarah-vyavhaar na karke barabari kaa bartaav rakhen
 Everyone was given the right to vote
 sevaaon main ghoose lenaa nishiddh kar diya gaya or ghoosekhoron ko bahut kadi sajaayen di garin
 The curtain was lifted from the women's attire and the men began to wear suits leaving the old fashioned passages
 isse bhi bada sudhaar yah tha ki arabi lipi ko hataakar puure desh main roman lipi kii sthapana kii gayi
 Kamal himself went on the streets and taught Turkish language in Roman alphabet
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki sara turki sangathit hokar ek ho gaya or algaav kii bhaavana samaapt ho gayi
 Simultaneously, Kamal organized the Turkish army in a very modern manner
 is prakaar turk jati kamaal pasha ke kaaran aadhunik jati bani
 By the time Mustafa Kamal Ataturk died on the 10th of November, 1938, his name as the creator of modern Turkey had shone like the sun in the world
 vaise to kamaal pasha ke jivan main chaar striyon ke saath uskaa prem prasang chalaa kintu shaadi usne keval latifi ussaki se hi kii
 Although she did not have any children, and she died childless
 bibi ke marane ke baad mustafaa kamaal pasha ne kabhi vivaah nahin kiya
 To overcome the isolation of life, he adopted thirteen orphans and raised them in a better way
 in teraa bacchon main bhi baarah ladkiyaan thim or keval ek hi ladkaa tha

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 hopkins, oleviyar ke pratisthaapak ban gaye or jab august strindburg kii film da dance of deth ke nirmaan ke dauraan oleviyar ko pathari ho gai to unhone unka kirdaar nibhaayaa
 Olivier later wrote in his memoir Confession of an Actor that "a new young actor with an extraordinary talent named Anthony Hopkins was working under me in the company and he stepped out of the role of Edgar as a cat in his teeth The rat escapes by pressing it
 " Despite his success at National, Hopkins was tired of the same type of role and was keen to work in films
 unhone 1967 main BBC ke prasaaran e fli in har year main chote parde par apni shuruuaat kii
 In 1968, he got a chance to play Richard i in The Lion in Winter, with Peter o Tully, Catherine Hepburn and future James Bond star Timothy Dalton starring Philip II of France
