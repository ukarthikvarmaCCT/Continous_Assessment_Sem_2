 It is used in some way: bhashadarshan kaa sambandh in chaar kendriya samasyaon se he- arth kii prakruti, bhashaa prayog, bhashaa sangyaan, tathaa bhashaa or vaastaviktaa ke bich sambandh
 But some philosophers do not consider linguistics as a separate subject, considering it to be a part of logic

 Many technical terms had to be sheltered to compose grammar
 naam, aakhyaat upsarg, nipaat, kriya, ling, vachan, vibhakti, pratyay ityadi shabdon ke madhyam se bhashaa ke vibhinn roopon kaa vishleshan kiya gaya
 Deep thinking, subtle thinking and the method of discovering truth is called philosophy
 is kaaran bhashaa ke vishleshan ko bhi darshanashastra kaa str mil gaya
 In Vedic literature itself, this level began to be found

 When there was curiosity about the metal, the tradition, the name, the famous, etc
, they were also resolved and the long tradition of the Acharyas who did the solution was also established
 niruktkaar yask ne naam, aakhyaat aadi ke vivaran prastut karte hue katipay purvaacharyon ke maton kaa ullekh kiya he
 It is clear from this that the philosophical process of grammar in this country had reached a high stage of development several hundred years before Christ
 upsarg tathaa naam shabdon ke swaroop ke sambandh main apane se purvavarti acharya gargy tathaa shakatayan ke paraspar virdohi maton kaa ullekh yask ne apane nirukt main bhi kiya he
 In this Nirukta, 2 major and basic principles of the Akhandavayakya Vyakaranadarshana of one Acharya Oudumbarayana have been mentioned by Bhartrihari in the phrase, and Bharatamishra in Sphotasiddha
 yudhshthir mimasak audumbrayan acharya kaa samay 3100 varsh vikrampurv athwa usase kuch purv maanate hai
 The doctrine called Sphotwad, which is distinguished on the principle of syllogism, is believed to be related to the earlier Acharya Sphotayan from Panini
 sphotayan acharya kaa ullekh panini ne ‘avagh sphotynasy’ sutara par kiya he
 Haradatta has interpreted the word sphotaion as follows- yudhisthir mimasak spaphotayan acharya kaa samay 3200 vikram purv maanate hai
 But just as very little material of pre-panini grammatology is available today, similarly the philosophical ideas related to the grammar of the foregoing have also been less safe
 jaise shabdanishpattivyavastaanarup sanskritvyakaran kaa suvyavasthit rup panini se armbh hota he vaise hi vyakarandarshan kaa bhi spasht rup panini se hi armbh hota he
 Although Panini had written Ashtadhyayi for the sake of word-of-mind, but due to his grammatical structure, he had to compose many definitions-formulas
 anek sangyashbd banane pade or paribhaashik shabdon ke lakshan dene pade
 We see that in this inversion of Acharya, a detailed background of grammatical philosophy was created on its own
 panini dwaara prayukt vibhaasha, padvidhi, aadesh, vipratishedh, upmaan, ling, kriyatipatti, kalvibhag, vipsa, pratyaylakshan, bhavalakshan, shabdarthprakruti jaise saikadon shabd is baat ke pratik hai ki ve un dinon ke darshanik vaadon se purnroop se avgat the or swayan ucchkoti ke darshanik chintak the
 Many of his sutras are a philosophy in themselves
 udhaaharan ke rup main ham nimna sutron par drushtipaat kar sakate hai- The truth is that Panini is a certified teacher for later philosophers
 baad ke vaiyakarnon ne vyakaran se sambaddh jo kuch vichaar vyakt kiye hai unka anumodan ve kisi na kisi tarah panini ke sutron se karte hai
 All the opinions related to grammar philosophy are confirmed by Panini's beliefs
 kisi pracheen acharya kii ukti he, jo kuch vritti-granthon main he or jo kuch vaartikon main he, vah sab sutron main hi he

 konark surya mandir bharat main urisa rajya ke puri jile ke antargat puri naamak shahar main pratishthit he
 It is one of the few sun temples of India
 san 1984 main unesco ne ise vishwa dharohar sthal ke rup main manyata di he
 This temple was dedicated to Surya-deva, meaning extracts, which the locals called biranchi-narayan
 isi kaaran is kshetra ko use arq-kshetra yaa padam-kshetra kaha jaataa tha
 According to the Puranas, Lord Krishna's son Samb had developed leprosy due to his curse
 samb ne mithravan main chandrabhaga nadi ke sagar sangam par konark main, baarah varshon tak tapasya kii or surya dev ko prasann kiya tha
 Suryadev, who was the destroyer of all diseases, had also prevented its disease
 tadnusaar samb ne surya bhagwaan kaa ek mandir nirmaan kaa nishchay kiya
 Taking a bath in the Chandrabhaga river, after his destruction, he found a statue of Suryadev
 yah murti suryadev ke sharir ke hi bhaag se, devshilpi shri vishwakarma ne banaayi thi
 Samb installed this idol in a temple in his built Mitravan, since then this place came to be considered sacred
 yah kai itihaaskaaron kaa mat he, ki konark mandir ke nirmaankarta, raja langool nrisinghdev kii akaal mrityu ke kaaran, mandir kaa nirmaan kaary khatai main pad gaya
 As a result, the unfinished structure collapsed
 lekin is mat ko aitihaasik aankadon kaa samarthan nahin miltaa he
 According to the figures of the Madal Register of Puri and some 1278 AD copper sheets, it was revealed that King Langul Narsinghdeva ruled till 1282
 kai itihaaskaar, is mat ke bhi hai, ki konark mandir kaa nirmaan 1253 se 1260 i
 ke bich hua tha
 Therefore, the incomplete construction of the temple is not logical to be the reason for its collapse
 yahan par mandir kii dhwastata ke sampoorn kaarnon kaa ullekh karnaa jatil kaary se kam nahin he
 But it is well known that much of it has now been destroyed
 jiske mukhya kaaran vaastu dosha bhi kaha jaataa he parantu muslim akramanon kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 It is said that this temple was eroded in just 800 years due to its architectural defects
 jise vaastu kala va niyamon ke viruddh kaha-suna jaataa he
 For this reason, even before its time period, it collapsed despite being a unique example of Rigveda and Stone Art
 is surya-mandir ke mukhya vaastu dosha hai:-
 According to many legends, a magnetic stone is placed on the summit of the Sun Temple
 iske prabhaav se, konark ke samudr se guzarane vaale sagarpot, is ore khinche chale aate hai, jisase unhen baari kshati ho jaati he
 According to another legend, due to this stone, the magnetic direction representation devices of ships do not tell the right direction
 is kaaran apane poton ko bachaane hetu, muslim navik is pathar ko nikaal le gayi
 This stone was acting as a central stone, so that all the stones in the temple walls were in balance
 iske hatane ke kaaran, mandir kii deevaaron kaa santulan kho gaya or parinamtah ve gir padin
 But there is no historical description of this incident, nor is there any description of the existence of any such magnetic central stone
 konark mandir ke girane se sambandhi ek ati mahatvapurn siddhant, kalapahad se judaa he
 According to the history of Orissa, Kalapahad invaded here in 1508 and destroyed many Hindu temples of Orissa including Konark temple
 puri ke jagannatha mandir ke madan panji bataate hai, ki kaise kalapahaad ne urisa par hamalaa kiya
 He also demolished the statues of most Hindu temples, including the Konark temple
 haalanki konark mandir kii 20-25 feet moti deevaaron ko todna asambhav tha, usne kisi prakaar se dadhinauti ko hilaane kaa prayojan kar liya, jo ki is mandir ke girane kaa kaaran bana
 Due to the removal of Dadhinauti, the temple started to fall slowly and due to heavy stone falling from the roof, the roof of the silent hall also collapsed
 usne yahan kii adhikansh murtiyon or konark ke anya kai mandir bhi dhwast kar diye
 In 1568, the terror of Muslims in Orissa was under control
 parantu iske baad bhi hindu mandiron ko todane ke nirantar prayaas hote rahe
 At this time, the pandas of Jagannath temple of Puri removed the idol of Lord Jagannath from the shrine and hid it in a secret place
 isi prakaar, konark ke surya mandir ke pandon ne pradhan devtaa kii murti ko hataa kar, varshon tak ret main dabaa kar chipaaye rakhaa
 Later, this idol was sent to Puri and placed there in the temple of Indra, located in the courtyard of the Jagannath temple
 anya logon ke anusaar, yahaan kii puja murtiyon abhi bhi khoji jaani baaki hai
 But many people say that the idol of Surya Dev, which is kept in the National Museum of New Delhi, is the main worship idol of Konark
 phir bhi konark main, surya vandana mandir se murti ke hatane ke baad se band ho gayi
 Due to this, pilgrims stopped coming to Konark
 konark kaa pattan bhi daakuon ke hamale ke kaaran, band ho gaya
 Konark was a famous city for commercial activities similar to Surya Vandana, but due to the closure of these activities, it became completely uninhabited and was covered with a deep forest for years
 san 1626 main, khurda ke raja, nrisingh dev, suputr shri purushottam dev, suryadev kii murti ko do anya surya or chandra kii murtiyon sahit puri le gayi
 Now they meet in the courtyard of the temple of Puri
 puri ke madal panji ke itihaas se gyaat hota he, ki san 1028 main, raja nasinghdev ne konark ke sabhi mandiron ke naap-jokh kaa aadesh diya tha
 At the time of the measurement, the Sun Temple existed up to its Amalka sila, i
e
 about 200 feet high
 kalapahaad ne keval uskaa kalash, balki padam-dhwaja, camel-kirit or upree bhaag bhi dhwans kiye the
 As mentioned earlier, in front of the mouthpiece, there was a large stone block - Navagraha Pat
 khurda ke tatkaaleen raja ne vah khand hatwa diya, saath hi konark se kai shilp krit pashaan bhi le gaya
 And used them in the construction of the temple of Puri
 maratha kaal main, puri ke mandir kii chaharadivari ke nirmaan main konark ke pathar prayog kiye gayi the
 It is also reported that all parts of the Nat temple have been in their original state for the longest period of time
 or inhen maratha kaal main jaan boojh kar anupayogi bhaag samaj kar todaa gaya
 In 1779, a Maratha monk removed the Arun Pillar of Konark and got it installed in front of the Sinhwar Gate of Puri
 aththarahavin shatabdi ke ant tak, konark ne apana, sara vaibhav kho diya or ek jangal main badal gaya
 Along with this, the area of the temple also became a forest, where there were bases of wild animals and bandits
 yahaan sthaneey log bhi din ke prakaash tak main jane se darate the
 The word Konark is made up of a combination of the words 'angle' and 'extract'
 arq kaa arth hota he surya jabaki kone se abhipraay kone yaa kinare se rahaa hoga
 The Konark sun-temple presented is made of red sandstone and black granite stones
 ise 1236–1264 isa purv gang vansh ke tatkaaleen samant raja nrisinghdev dwaara banwaaya gaya tha
 This temple is one of the most famous sites in India
 ise unesco dwaara san 1984 main vishwa dharohar sthal ghoshit kiya gaya he
 The temple built in Kalinga style, the Sun God is enshrined as a chariot and the stones are engraved with exquisite carvings
 sampoorn mandir sthal ko baarah jodi chakron ke saath saat ghodon se khinchate huye nirmit kiya gaya he, jisamen surya dev ko virajman dikhaaya gaya he
 But currently only one of the seven horses remains
 mandir ke aadhaar ko sundarata pradaan karte ye baarah chakra saal ke baarah maheenon ko paribhaashit karte hai tathaa prayek chakra aath aron se mil kar bana he, jo ar din ke aath peharon ko darshaate hai
 Locals here used to call the Sun God presented as birnchi-narayan
 mukhya mandir teen mandapon main bana he
 Of these, two tents have collapsed
 tisare mandap main jahaan murti thi, angrezon ne bhartiya swatantraaa se purv hi ret va pathar bharva kar sabhi dwaaron ko sthaayee rup se band karvaa diya tha taaki vah mandir or kshatigrast naa ho paae
 There are three idols of Sun God in this temple: iske pravesh par do singh haathiyon par aakraamak hote hue raksha main tatpar dikhaaye gaye hai
 It is probably a symbol of the dominance of the then Brahmin lions in the form of Buddhist elephants
 donon hathi, ek-ek maanav ke upar sthapit hai
 These statues are made of the same stone
 ye 28 ton kii 8
4feet lambii 4

 The southern part of the temple consists of two well-equipped horses, which have been adopted by the Orissa government as its emblem
 ye 10 feet lambey va 7 feet chaude hai
 The temple shows the grand journey of the Sun God

 This is the place where the dancers of the temple danced to offer to Suryadev
 puure mandir main jahaan tahaan phool-bel or jyamitiya namoonon kii nakkashi kii gai he
 Along with these, the figures of human, god, gandharva, eunuch etc
 are also depicted in austral postures
 inaki mudraaen kaamuk hai or kamasutra se leen gayi hai
 The temple is now partially converted into ruins
 yahaan kii shilp kalakritiyon kaa ek sangrah, bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag ke surya mandir sangrahalay main surakshit he
 The great poet and dramatist Ravindra Nath Tagore has written about this temple: - Konark where the language of stones is superior to the language of man
 terahavin sadi kaa mukhya surya mandir, ek mahaan rath rup main bana he, jiske baarah jodi susajjit pahiye hai, evam saat ghodon dwaara khinchaa jaataa he
 This temple is one of the outstanding monument sites in India
 yahaan ke sthapaty anupaat dosha se rahit evam aayam aashcharyachakit karne vaale hai
 The architecture here is a harmonious confluence of splendor and human devotion
 mandir kii prayek inch, adwitiya sundarataa or shobhaa kii shilpakritiyon se paripurna he
 Its subjects are also enchanting, which are full of thousands of sculptures of Gods, Gods, Gods, Gandharvas, humans, instruments, loving couples, court images, hunting and war pictures
 inke bich bich main pashu-pakshiyon or puranic jeevon, ke alaava maheen or pechida bel boote tathaa jyamitiya namoonay alankrita hai
 The exquisite diamond-like quality of Odia craftsmanship stands out throughout the campus
 yah mandir apni kaamuk mudraon vaali shilpakritiyon ke liye bhi prasiddh he
 These types of figures are found mainly at the second level of the doorway

 In 1896, Zeman examined the sodium flame by placing it between two poles of a strong electromagnet and discovered that both sharp yellow lines of the spectrum widened somewhat
 yadi varnakramdarshi kii vibhedan-kshamta kaafii adhik ho to chumbakeey kshetra main rakhe prakaash strot kii prayek varnakram rekha kai ghatak rekhaon main vibhajit ho jaati he
 This phenomenon is called the Zeman effect
 san 1892 main farade ne yahi prabhaav dekhne kaa asafal praytn kiya tha
 The absorbing lines divide into components when the absorber medium is placed in a magnetic field
 ise vyutkram zemaan prabhaav kehete hai
 To see the Zeeman effect, spectral lines are inspected by the addition of a device with a high differential potential, such as the Lumer – Gehrke board and the rule deviation spectrograph

 a longitudinal view requires a groove or tunnel parallel to the magnetic field in the middle of a pole of the magnet
 lorents ne apane dravya or vikiran ke electron siddhant ke aadhaar par isaki vyakhya kii or yah bhavishyavaanee ko ki ye varnakram rekhaayen chumbakeey kshetra dwaara dhruvit ho jaani chahie
 In longitudinal view these lines should have circular polarization and transverse angle should have linear polarization
 in bhavishyavaaniyon kaa zemaan ne satyaapan kiya
 Lorents showed by his theory that when looking at the spectral line of light perpendicular to the magnetic field, three component lines should be visible
 zemaan prabhaav main jab uparyukt visthaapan par keval teen ghatak rekhaayen dekhin jaayan, use prakrut zemaan prabhaav kehete hai tathaa un ghatak rekhaon ke namoonay kaa prakrut trik yaa lorents trik kehete hai
 But when a spectral line divides into many more component lines, it is called the unaudited Zeeman effect, because it cannot be interpreted on the basis of the iconic principle
 prakrut zemaan trik vishesh rup he or ekak shrenee kii varnakram rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he, jabaki praarambhik or antim urja dasha kaa lande gunank ek ke baraabar hota he
 Ordinary Lorents were seen in the spectrum of tri-zinc and cadmium, and the measurement of their frequencies, and the magnitude of e / m by the above formula, was found to be equal to the e / m ejected by the negative rays
 yah parinaam aikya tathaa anudairdhyadrishy main vrittiya dhruvan ke ghumaav kii prekshit disha, is baat kaa pramaan hai ki parmanviya varnakram main vikiran chalyman rinatmak vidyut aavesh dwaara nikalataa he
 Preston established by using devices with greater deflection and differentiation capability that the sample of ground-component-lines of a specific range of the same spectral lines was of the same type and characterized by that category
 is prakaar zemaan prabhaav varnakram vishleshan kaa vishisht saadhan ban gaya
 In 1907 Rouge showed that the displacement of the component lines of unmodified Zemann samples can be manifested as the displacement product of the natural triplet lines
 udaahranarth ke p or s ghatakon kaa visthaapan or lorents ikaiyaan hoga
 For this it will be displacement Lorents units
 zemaan prabhaav tabhi dekha jaataa he jab bahya chumbak kshetra electron kii bhrami tathaa kaksha gatiyon dwaara utpann kiye gaye aantarik kshetra se nirbal hota he; parantu jab bahya kshetra in aantarik kshetron se ati prabal hota he tab zemaan prabhaav pashchan-back prabhaav main parinat ho jaataa he
 This effect was noticed by Paschon and Beck in 1912 and found that in a much more intense magnet field, the natural Zeman component sample turns to the natural Zeman component sample natural Zeman triad
 isi liye zemaan prabhaav varnakram vishleshan or parmaanuon or yanon kii electron rachana kaa pataa lagane kaa mukhya saadhan he
 Some interesting properties in the Sun and stars can only be discovered with the help of the Zeman effect

 waapas bulaane ke adhikaar janata kaa vah adhikaar jiske anusaar yadi vah apane kisi nirvaachit pratinidhi se santusht nahin he or use hataanaa chaahati he to nirdhaarit prakriya ke anusaar use waapas bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 The history of the right to recall elected representatives is very old
 pracheen kaal main anthenian loktantr se hi yah kanoon chalan main tha
 Many countries later incorporated this recall into their constitution
 vaise itihaas yah he ki is kanoon kii utpatti switsraland se hui par yah america rajyon main chalan main aayaa
 In 1903, the Municipality of Las Angeles, USA, in 1908 was first applied to the Right to Recall State Officials in Michigan and Oregon
 baat jab bhartiya paripekshya main karte hai to yah waapas bulaane kaa adhikaar yani rhite tu rikaal bihar kii jameen se upja he
 Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan first gave the slogan of Right to Recall during the entire revolution on 4 November 1974
 unhone chun kar gayi janpratinidhiyon kii vaapasi kii baat kii
 As of now, the right to recall Right to Recall means elected representatives are limited to slogans only
 is babat kisi bhi tarah ke thos kanoon ko lekar kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ne koi pahal nahin he
 The Supreme Court also said in one of its decisions that right to recall is the most important mechanism in the present situation through which people can be empowered
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne haal hi main bihar munisapal act ko sanshodhit kar rhite tu rikaal yani waapas bulaane ke adhikaar ko usamen shaamil kiya he
 The right to recall the elected chief in the Panchayati Raj system of Bihar is already here
 nagar nikaayon ke liye lagu rhite tu rikaal main yah praavdhaan he ki kisi nirvaachit nikaay pratinidhi se sambandhit ward ke pachaas fisadi se adhik matadaataaon ko ek hastakshrit aavedan nagar vikaas vibhaag ko dena he
 The department has to look at the merit of that signed application
 agar vibhaag is baat se sahamat he ki sambandhit ward counciller ne do tihaai matadaataaon kaa vishwaas kho diya he to vah ukt kanusiller ko hataa saktaa he
 The government has empowered voters to call back their elected representative when they do not like it
 rhite tu rikaal chhattisgarh main bhi lagu he
 The biggest screw in this Right to Recall is how the government officials will finally decide whether the signed application of two thirds of the voters against the councilor concerned is correct

 karachi main, nihaari ne puri tarah se safalataa praapt kii or sheeghra hi pure pakistan main lokapriy ho gaya
 The Hyderabadi form of Nihari is served together with the bone and tongue
 nihaari ke anya roopon main kai brand companiyon dwaara shighr pakane vaale masala vyanjanon ke prasar ke kaaran lokapriy vyanjan he

 yah vartmaan main patan sangrahalay main surakshit he
 Xuanzang in India: anda gol yaa andakar jivit vastu he jo bahut se praaniyon ke maadaa dwaara paidaa kii jaati he
 Most animal eggs have a hard cover that protects the eggs
 yadhyapi anda jeevadhariyon dwaara apni santane paidaa karne kaa maarg he, kintu anda khaane ke kaam bhi aata he
 Protein and choline are rich in it in terms of nutrients
 prayek jati kii chidiyon ke andon main, thodi bahut bhinnata bhale hi ho, par inaki apni ek visheshta hoti he
 The size, shape and color of the eggs of birds of each race is unique
 pakshiyon ke jivan or unke angon ke aakaar, maap, sataha kii rachana or rang main ek sambandh he
 Similarly, there is a relation between the number of eggs within a bulk or group and the number of clots in a season
 andey kii maap mukhyat: anda denevaali chidiya ke dealdol par nirbhar karti he, kintu yah aavashyak nahin he ki anupaat hameshaa ek ho
 There are two reasons for this : murgi ke andey kaa jo aakaar hota he, vahi aakaar praaia: anya chidiyon ke andon kaa hota he
 The egg is long in one direction and has one end rounded and the other end slightly pointed
 andey ek chor par gol or duusare chor par nukile hone se saralata se ludhak nahin pate
 Also, with the pointed portion of the eggs being centered in the middle of the nest and their spherical portion facing out, if the nest contains three to four eggs, they all easily hatch
 kuch chidiyon ke andey lagbhag golakaar hote hai
 Owl eggs are spherical and bacassi eggs are thin and round at both ends
 kuch chidiyon ke andon kii satahen chikani hoti hai, kuch kii chamakili, kuch kii bahut adhik paalishdaar or kuch kii khurdari tathaa khadianuma hoti he
 The color of eggs also varies in different sparrows
 kuch chidiyon ke andey bilkul safed hote hai, kintu kuch ke andey rangeen, hare, nile, bhure or lalachaunh hote hai
 Some have the same color of eggs and some have pinto or speckled
 chitiyaan dhabbe ke rup main, athwa chaktton ke rup main hoti he or thodi athwa atyadhik sankhya main hoti hai
 The spots may be evenly scattered on the surface of the eggs, or more in one part and less in another
 kuch jati ke pakshiyon main ek hi jati ke antargat vibhinn sadasyon ke andon ke rang or chihnon main vyaktigat bhinnata hoti he
 Egg color is predominantly defensive
 atev hari daaliyon par die janevaale andon kaa rang haraa or jameen par die janevaale andon kaa rang praaia: bhura hota he
 Cotter or burrow eggs are often white, so that birds can detect them even in the dark
 gilmaat or regerbil keval ek hi anda detii hai, paravat yaa junglee kabutar or garud do, dhomara yaa gangachilli kii vibhinn jatiyaan teen or tittibh kii anek jatiyaan chaar andey detii hai
 Many species lay up to five to six eggs
 kuch gaanevaali choti kism kii chidiyon main saat aath se lekar das baarah tak andey milte hai
 Some hunting birds and ducks have even higher numbers
 adhikansh chidiyaan, yadi unke andey chura liye jaaain, athwa nasht ho jaaain, athwa andon ko tyaagane ke liye ve baadhya kar di jaayen, to phir se andey detii hai, kyonki har pakshi ke andon kii ek nishchit sankhya hoti he
 Until this number is reached, it does not stop laying eggs
 chidiyaan saadharantaya ek ritu main ek hi baar ade detii hai
 Some singing birds produce children two or three times during the season
 jin chidiyon ke andey or bachche adhik nasht hote hai, athwa jo alpaayu hoti hai, unamem janan teevr gati se or andon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 The age of sparrows also affects their number of eggs
 pratham baar maan bananevaali chidiyaan kam or duusari yaa teesri baar andey denevaali chidiyaan adhik andey detii hai
 When the number of eggs is complete, their army begins
 pakshi badi lagan or tatparta se andey sete hai, apane pankhons se unhen garam rakhte tathaa unki raksha karte hai : In most castes, both males and females perform the function of ovulation, even though the hatching works slightly more then the other
 kabhi kabhi din main maadaa andey seti he or raatri main nar
 In some castes, only females lay eggs, but in such a state the male raises food for it
 kisi kisi jati main nar or maadaa baari baari sein aate jate rahete hai
 During the egg-intake period, the female gets attention in hatching and such a concentration is created that if someone removes her eggs and keeps any other thing, like stone pieces, ballasts, etc
, then she will be without See, they will sit and sit on them
 bahudhaa aisa dekha gaya he ki andon ke kharaab yaa nirjeev ho jane par bhi maadaa ek lambii avadhi tak unhen seti rahati he
 In pigeons, the male incubates the egg with great fervor
 yahi nahin, balki maadaa ko hataakar swayan andon par baithta he
 The male cannot give himself, but in the desire of childbirth, he somehow binds the female and binds her, fetches the eggs from the female and then performs all the activities of her hatching and grooming herself with great enthusiasm
 lapland or ouk jati ke pakshiyon main nar kii sankhya adhik he, maadaa kii kam
 Thus, not all male pairs are successful in tying, but their desire for hatching and rearing of children does not go through their heart
 isse thik vipareet kuch pakshi aise bhi hai, jo andon ko swayan na sekar dusron se sevate hai
 Cuckoo, papiha etc
 are the main among them, who steal their eggs in the nests of crows, sparrows or satbhaiya etc
 and fool them and take care of them as midwives
 kuch aise pakshi hai, jo andon ko na to swayan sete hai or na auron se sevate hai, balki unhen dhoop ke taap se pakaakar unki raksha karte hai
 a bird named Ostrich prepares the pit with the rubbing of its chest and erects a wall by placing sand with a beak around it
 phir isi main maadaaen, praaia: 20 se 30 tak, andey dete hai
 Ostrich does not have a single female, a male has many wives and all of them pass eggs in turn
 andey dene kaa kaam puraa ho jane par, inpar ek halki si baaluu kii parat bicha di jaati he
 These eggs are warmed by the rays of the sun throughout the day
 ratrikaal main ye pakshi inpar baithper inhen ushnata pradaan karte hai
 There are many birds, which are built near a hot spring and lay eggs in them, then cover them and go elsewhere
 jharne ke ushn jal se ye andey garam rahete hai
 At the end of the time, they come back and remove the top soil, then the children come out after breaking the eggs
 jahaan atyadhik garmi padati hai, vahaan ke pakshi andon ko thandha rakhane kii vyavastha karte hai, garam rakhane kii nahin
 For this, they soak their beaks in water and soak eggs in them, so that they do not get damaged due to excessive heat
 sevankaal bhi, chidiyon main vibhinn hota he
 In larger sparrows or in sparrows whose children develop well, the intake period is longer
 kisi kisi main sevankaal ek maheene kaa or kisi kisi main do saptaah se bhi kam kaa hota he
 Months are spent incubating eggs on a bird
 murgi ko anda sene main teen saptaah lagate hai, teetar ko chaar, hans ko paanch tathaa cander naamak pakshi ko puure do maheene
 Birds' eggs are laid outside and embryonic development takes place inside the eggs
 bhrun ke purna viksit ho jane par vihang shishu andey rupi kaidakhane se baahar aane ke liye apni chonch se baar baar prahaar karata he or andey ke bichon bich, athwa anya kisi chaude sthal par jatibhed ke anusaar, ek daraar ho jaati he or shishu baahar nikal aata he
 At that time he remains soaked with a fluid, which dries up quickly due to wind
 murgi, teetar, shuturamurg aadi ke bachche to nikalate hi daudna shuru kar dete hai, par tote, phakhte or coy aadi ke shishu kai dinon tak aankh nahin khol pate,
 They remain in a state of immortality and spend their infancy days in weeks in Dhansale
 andey se baahar aane par shishu chidiya ke pratham kuch saptaah kuch vishesh kathinaaiyon evam khataron ke hote hai
 These days she is not only small and weak, but often unable to swallow food herself and is also helpless by flying
 bhinn jati ke pakshiyon ke shishu bhinn avasthaa main utpann hote hai or is aadhaar par unka vargeekaran nimnlikhit do pramukh shreniyon main kiya ja saktaa he : The eyes of a dormant baby are open from birth and their body is covered with soft feathers
 ye aarambh se hi satark tathaa chanchal hote hai or daud yaa tair sakate hai
 Yes, if they are not teased, then after birth they would like to remain silent for a few hours
 ye prarambh se hi apana dana swayan chugana shuru kar dete hai
 Ducks and chickens are good examples of this
 junglee chidiyon main tittibh, jalkukkuti, batakh or shikaar kii anya chidiyon ke shishu bhi aisa hi karte hai
 Another feature of hunting birds is that they also start flying soon
 needvasi shishu janm ke pashchaat bade hone tak ghonsle main hi pade rahete hai or inhen aahaar ke liye apane maan baap par hi purnat: nirbhar rahanaa padataa hai
 They are blind and helpless at birth and more or less bare in most cases; That is, they are non-smoking and unattractive
 bataakhi, kilkila ; or harith kashthakut ke shishu bilkul nange utpann hote hai
 Cormorant and Buck are a group of birds whose children are completely naked at birth, that is, they live on very little on their body
 pakshi jis tatparta ke saath andey sete hai, usee tatparta se apni santan kaa paalan poshan evam rakshan bhi karte hai
 In child protection it is often seen that birds do not even worry about their lives
 santanraksha main tarah-tarah kii bahanebaajiyaan karke ye pakshi aagatuk ko achambhe main bhi daale dete hai
 Often they start to see it and hang it as if they were injured by a hunter
 dushman shikari, badhik, shwaan, shrugaladi inhen pakadaney kii aashaa lekar jab inkaa peechha karte hai, to ye dur tak chakma dete hue nikal jate hai or tab ekaek teji se udakar kahin chal dete hai
 In this way, taking the enemy away from the nest and astray him, so that he can move in some other direction and avoid the calamity on the babies of the needles
 chidiyaan dusron kii aankh main dhul jhonknaa bhi khub jaanati hai
 When they are sometimes surrounded, they lie dead and lie on the ground, which the viewer considers them dead and moves forward
 phir ye sheeghra jameen chhodkar aage bhaag khadi hoti he
 Sometimes even if caught, they pretend to be dead, so that we can leave them as dead

 The 15th took place in the village of Buldih

 trishikhibrahmanopanishad shukla yajurvedic shakha ke antargat ek upanishad he
 This Upanishad is written in Sanskrit language
 iske rachiyata vaidic kaal ke rishiyon ko mana jaataa he parantu mukhyat vedavyas ji ko kai upanishdon kaa lekhak mana jaataa he There is no opinion of scholars regarding the creation of Upanishads

 They are the most ancient
