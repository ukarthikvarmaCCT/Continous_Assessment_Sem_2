 He is called the wizard of hockey
 unhone apane khel jivan main 1000 se adhik gol daage
 When he got down to play in the field, the ball used to stick to his hockey stick
 unhen 1956 main bharat ke pratishthit naagarik sammaan padmabhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Apart from this, many organizations and famous people have been demanding from time to time to honor him with 'bharataratna' but now the possibility of being conferred on him has increased greatly due to the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the center
 major dhyanchand kaa janm 29 agast san 1905 i
 ko elahabaad me hua tha
 There were no special signs of sportsmanship in his childhood
 isliye kaha ja saktaa he ki hockey ke khel kii pratibha janmajaat nahin thi, balki unhone satat sadhana, abhyaas, lagan, sangharsh or sankalp ke sahare yah pratishtha arjeet kii thi
 After obtaining general education, at the age of 16, in 1922 AD, in the first Brahmin Regiment in Delhi, he enlisted in the army as an ordinary soldier
 jab 'first brahman regiment' main bharti hue us samay tak unke man main hockey ke prati koi vishesh dilchaspee yaa ruchi nahin thi
 The credit for motivating Dhyanchand to play hockey is to Major Tiwari, a Subedar of the Regiment
 major tiwari swany bhi premi or khilaadi the
 Dhyanchand started playing hockey under his supervision and he became a great player of the world
 san 1927 i
 main lans nayak bana die gaye

 When the Second World War started, in 1943, 'lieutenant' was appointed and after India became independent, he was made captain in 1948 AD
 keval hockey ke khel ke kaaran hi sena main unki padonnati hoti gai
 In 1938 he received the 'viceroy's commission' and became the Subedar
 uske baad ek ke baad ek duusare soobedaar, leftinent or captain banate chale gaye
 He was later made a Major
 dhyanchand ko footbal main pele or cricket main breadman ke samatuly mana jaataa he
 The ball would stick to his stick so much that the rival player often feared that he was playing with the magic stick
 yahan tak holland main unki hockey stick main chumbak hone kii ashanka main unki stick tod kar dekhi gai
 In Japan, seeing the way the ball used to stick to Dhyanchand's hockey stick, it was said that his hockey stick would have glue
 dhyanchand kii hockey kii kalakaari ke jitne kisse hai utane shaayad hi duniya ke kisi anya khilaadi ke babat sune gaye hon
 Seeing his artistry of hockey, the fans of hockey used to wake up saying, but even the players of the rival team lost their intelligence and got excited to see his artistry
 unki kalakaari se mohit hokar hi germany ke rudolph hitler sareekhe ziddee samraat ne unhen germany ke liye khilne kii peshkash kar di thi
 But Dhyanchand always considered playing for India the greatest pride
 vienna main dhyanchand kii chaar haath main chaar hockey stick liye ek murti lagaai or dikhaaya ki dhyanchand kitne jabardast khilaadi the
 While he was in the Brahmin Regiment, Major Bale Tiwari, who was fond of hockey, learned the first lesson of hockey
 san 1922 i
 se san 1926 i

 jisamen 48 match jite or ek varsha hone ke kaaran sthagit ho gaya
 He scored over 400 goals in international matches
 april, 1949 i
 ko pratham koti kii haaki se sanyas le liya
 In 1928, the Indian team participated in the Amsterdam Olympic Games for the first time
 amsterdam main khilne se pehle bhartiya team ne england main 11 match khele or vahaan dhyanchand ko vishesh safalataa praapt hui
 In Amsterdam, the Indian team won all the first matches
 17 may san 1928 i
 ko austria ko 6-0, 18 may ko belgium ko 9-0, 20 may ko denmark ko 5-0, 22 may ko switzraland ko 6-0 tathaa 26 may ko final match main holland ko 3-0 se haraakar vishwa bhar main hockey ke champion ghoshit kiye gaye or 29 may ko unhen padak pradaan kiya gaya
 Dhyanchand scored two goals in the final
 1932 main las angeles main hui olympic pratiyogitaaon main bhi dhyanchand ko team main shaamil kar liya gaya
 At that time, he achieved considerable success and fame as a center forward
 tab sena main vah 'lens-nayak' ke baad nayak ho gayi the
 India played a lot of matches during this tour
 is sari yatra main dhyanchand ne 262 main se 101 gol swayan kiye
 In the decisive match, India defeated America 24–1
 tab ek america samachar patr ne likhaa tha ki bhartiya hockey team to purv se aayaa tufaan thi
 He crushed eleven players of the American team with his speed
 1936 ke berlin olpic khelon main dhyanchand ko bhartiya team kaa captain chunaa gaya
 On this, he expressed surprise and said - "I had no hope that i will be elected as captain" Well, he fulfilled this responsibility with honesty
 apane jivan kaa avismarani sansmaran sunaate hue vah kehete hai ki 17 july ke din german team ke saath hamaare abhyaas ke liye ek pradarshnee match kaa aayojan hua
 The match was played in Berlin
 ham isamen chaar ke badale ek gol se haar gaye
 i cannot forget the shock i felt from this defeat
 germany kii team kii pragati dekhakar ham sab aashcharyachakit rah gaye or hamaare kuch saathiyon ko to bhojan bhi acha nahin laga

 In the second match, which was played on 7 August, the Indian team beat Japan 9–0 and then beat France by 10 goals on 12 August
 15 agast ke din bharat or german kii tiimon ke bich final muqabla tha
 Although the match was to be played on 14 August, it rained so much that the ground was flooded and the game was postponed for a day
 abhyaas ke dauraan germany kii team ne bharat ko haraaya tha, yah baat sabhi ke man main buree tarah ghar kar gai thi
 Then our players were further disappointed due to wetlands and adverse conditions
 tabhi bhartiya team ke manager pankaj gupta ko ek yukti suujhi
 He took the players to the dressing room and suddenly he placed the tricolor flag in front of us and said that its shame is now in your hands
 sabhi khilaadiyon ne shraddhapurvak tirange ko salaam kiya or vir sainik kii tarah maidan main utar pade
 The Indian players played fiercely and defeated the German team 8–1
 us din sachmuch tirange kii laaj rah gai
 At that time, who knew that on August 15, India's Independence Day will be made
 dhyanchand ne apni karishmai hockey se german taanashaah hitler hi nahin balki mahaan cricketer don breadman ko bhi apana qaayal bana diya tha
 It is also a coincidence that both these great personalities of sports world are born within two days
 duniya ne 27 agast ko breadman kii janmashti manaai to 29 agast ko vah dhyanchand ko naman karne ke liye taiyaar he, jise bharat main khel diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Bradman was three years younger than Hockey's wizard
 apane-apane fan main maahir ye donon khel hastiyaan keval ek baar ek-duusare se mili the
 That was in 1935 when the Indian team visited Australia and New Zealand
 tab bhartiya team ek match ke liye edilade main tha or breadman bhi vahaan match khilne ke liye aae the
 Bradman and Dhyanchand then met each other
 breadman ne tab hockey ke jaadugar kaa khel dekhne ke baad kaha tha ki ve is tarah se gol karte hai, jaise cricket main ran banate hai
 Not only this, when Bradman later came to know that Dhyanchand scored 201 goals in 48 matches in this tour, his comment was, whether it was made by a hockey player or by a batsman
 dhyanchand ne iske ek saal baad berlin olympics main hitler ko bhi apni hockey kaa qaayal bana diya tha
 At that time, not only Hitler, but also the hockey fans of Germany had the same name and that was Dhyanchand
 unhen 1956 main bharat ke pratishthit naagarik sammaan padmabhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Dhyan Chand was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1956 in the field of sports
 unka janm 29 agast 1905 elahabaad, sanyukt praant, british bharat main hua tha
 His birthday has been declared as National Sports Day of India
 isi din khel main utkrisht pradarshan ke liye rashtriya puraskaar arjuna or dronacharya puraskaar pradaan kiye jate hai
 Dhyanchand was declared the player of the century by the Indian Olympic Association
 philhal dhyanchand ko bharat ratna dene kii maang bhi kii ja rahi he

 Induced abortion has long been a source of considerable debate
 naitik, darshanik, jaivik, garbhpaat ke aasapaas ke dharmik or kanoonee muddon mulya system se sambandhit hai
 Abortion opinions can be about fetal rights, governmental rights and women's rights
 donon saarvajanik or nijee bahes main, bahes kaa tark prerit yaa garbhpaat ke liye yaa to garbhpaat kii naitik sweekaaryata, yaa garbhpaat ko pratibandhit karne yaa pratibandhit karne vaale kanoonon kaa samarthan karne ke paksh main prastut kiya gaya tha
 The World Medical Association manifesto on medical abortion states, "the circumstances create a dilemma in bringing a mother's interest into conflict with the interests of her unborn child and raise the question of whether a pregnancy should be intentionally terminated" 
 " garbhpaat vaad-vivaad, vishesh rup se garbhpaat kanoonon se sambandhit, aksar in donon sthitiyon main se ek kii vakaalat karne vaale samoohon dwaara aage badhate hai

 The poet has been appointed as the deekshaguru of the art of love by Venus, the goddess of love, so he composed this poem in three books, which is written by Ovid at the beginning and end of this book
 us samay kii rang-railiyon se purna roman samaaj kii prishthbhumi main is kavy ke prakaashan se do parinaam ghatit hue
 On the one hand, the poet was determined to improve the society and who had banished even his only child, Yulia, due to behavioral laxity, became extremely angry with the poet

 In this composition, remedies have been given to remove love

 But around the same time, around 7 AD, the poet's fate was overturned and while he was in the island of Albanamak, he learned that the Emperor Augustu had exiled him
 uski sampatti kaa apharan nahin kiya, or nirvaasan kii ajna main koi kaaran bhi nirdisht nahin kiya gaya
 According to this, he had to spend the rest of his life in 'tomis' situated on the banks of Krishnasagar

 Around this time, the emperor had also exiled his younger brother Yulia due to ethics

 The poet's life in Tomis was extremely sad

 After Ashoka's death, the Satavahanas declared themselves independent
 sise kaa sikaa chalaane vaala pehla vansh satvaahan vansh tha, or vah sise kaa sikaa rome se laayaa jaataa tha
 For the first time in ancient India, under the Maurya dynasty, we tried to establish political and cultural unity
 baad main chalakar satvaahan vansh ne is prayaas ko aage badhaayaa
 Although historians Satavahanas are the successors of the Mauryas in the Deccan, the rise of this dynasty should also be understood as a normal Jain and Hindu process against the Buddhist kingdom of Ashoka
 satvaahan vansh kii sthapana maury vansh ke paraabhav se lagbhag pachaas varsh pehle hui

 From the information we have received about this period, we get to know about the singularities of the Satavahanas and their unique activities in different fields
 yadi puraanon ke vaktavyon par vishvas kiya jaae to dakkan ke is samrajya kii simaaen uttar bharat tak faili hui thi
 Magadha was a part of this empire, also spread over southern India and its boundaries were wide from eastern to western sea

 It was a result of the long and peaceful rule given by the Satavahanas in Central India and Deccan that the art and architecture developed, examples of which we can find in the sculpted cavities in the rocks of western India and the stupas and viharas of eastern India
 is kaal main samskruti kaa bhi atyadhik vikaas hua tathaa prakrut bhashaa kaa aakarshan rajdarbaron tak pahunchaa
 Although the Satavahana kingdom was a Hindu kingdom, Buddhism developed uniquely under them

 There is a complete lack of information and sources giving information about the Satavahanas
 unase sambandhit shilalekhon kii sankhya bahut kam he or is prastut shilalekhon main die gaye sandarbhon main bhi satvahanon ke vishay main purna jaankaree nahi milti

 Scholars like Thomas, Rapson, Cunningham, Bhagwan Lal Indra Ji and Scott have received important information from these coins
 parantu in sikkon ke bhangit tathaa kuch sikkon ke jaali hone ke kaaran kai vivaad uth khadey hue hai
 Literary sources have disappointed even more in this subject
 moulik puraanon main kaalaantar main jude ansho ke kaaran inamen satvahanon ke vishay main di gai suchanaaen ab vishwasaneey nahi rah gai hai
 Also, the situation has become even more suspicious in the various Puranas due to the absence of death in the context of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi gunadhay dwaara rachit brihad katha ko satvaahan rajya sangrakshan main likhaa hua mana jaataa he tathaapi yah kriti ab mul rup main nahi milti tathaa i par aadhaarit uske baad ke sanskarnon main di gai soochnaaon kii vyavastha vibhinn vidwaanon alag-alag kii he
 Similarly, Lilavati, which is related to the military campaigns and victories of the Satavahana ruler period, cannot be overstated
 is karanvash satvaahan kaal ke vishay main abhi hamaari jaankaree simit he
 There are profound differences among various scholars regarding the emergence of Satavahanas and their original place of residence
 shilaalekh tathaa sikkon main varnit satvaahan or shatakarni shaskaon ko puraanon main andhra, andhra-mrity tathaa andhra jaateey naamon se pukaara gaya he
 On this basis, scholars have reached the decision that Satavahana or Shatakarani kings were equivalent to Andhra
 rapasan, smith tathaa bhandarkar ke anusaar satvaahan shaasha andhra desh se sambandhit the
 About the Andhra people, the Puranas say that they were residents of the ancient Telugu region which was situated in the middle of the Godavari and Krishna river

 In Indica, Magasthenes mentioned their power and prosperity

 But what happened to them after the fall of the Maurya Empire is not known
 sambhavtah unhonn apane aapako swatantra ghashit kar diya
 Although the historians mentioned above consider Andhra Pradesh as the original abode of the Satavahanas, there are differences among these scholars regarding the center of their power
 jahaan smith shri kakulam ko satvahanon athwa andhron kii rajdhani maanate hai
 But scholars have differences regarding the relationship with Satavahanas
 samvaahan vansh ke shilalekhon main i kaal ke shaskaon ko nirantar rup se satvaahan athwa shatakarni kaha gaya he
 In the literary texts, the term Shali Vahan is also used for them
 parantu is sandarbh main andhra shabd kaa prayog is vansh ke kisi bhi shilaalekh main nahi he
 On the other hand, western India has been considered as their original place of residence on the basis of inscriptions, coins and literary sources
 is tathy kaa pramaan nanaghat tathaa saachin ke aarmabhik shilalekhon se bhi miltaa he
 On this basis, Dr
 Gopalachari has considered the original residence of the Satavahanas of the establishment and its surrounding area

 On this basis, the equivalence and homogeneity of Satavahanas and Andhra is doubtful
 is vishay main vidwaanon ne yah sujhaayaa he ki satvahanon ne apane aarmabhik jivan kii dakkan se shuruyaat kii tathaa kuch hi samay main andhra pradesh ko bhi jeet liya
 Later, when the western and northern regions of the Satavahana kingdom continued to pass through their hands due to suspicion and rich invasions, their power was probably limited to the central region between Godavari and Krishna river i
e
andhra Pradesh and now Satavahanas came to be known as Andhra
 
 satvahanon kii utpati ke vishay main bhi hamen jaankaree nahi he
 Some scholars have compared him to the Satyaputras mentioned in the inscriptions of Ashoka and some to the Setai described by Pliny

 The proof of this is also found in the Nasik inscription, in which Gautami's son Shri Shatkarni has been decorated as a Brahmin and Khatiyya-swa-man-madan, ie, a man who marshals of Kshatriyas, etc
 isi shilaalekh ke lekhak ne gautamiputra kii tulana parashuram se kii he
 In addition, in the Datrishatputlika also, the Shalivahanas are said to have originated from mixed Brahmin caste and Nagajati
 satvahanon ke kalkram ko lekar vidwaanon main gahare matbhed hai
 The Aitreya Brahmana, which was written in 500 BC, mentions the bandits who were outside the Arya Periphery and who were the descendants of Vishwamitra
 is aadhaar par dody0aar0 bhandarkar ne 500 i0purv ko satvahanon kii aarmabhik sthiti mana he
 According to Dr
 V
 A
 Smith, Andhra was subordinate at first, but after his death he became independent under the leadership of Simukh and this incident happened in the third century BCE
 is vishay main smith ne puraanon kaa hi aadhaar mana he jinke anusaar andhron ke kul tees shaskaon ne lagbhag 460varshon tak shashan kiya
 Dr
 Gopalachari also accepted this fact by acknowledging that the Satavahana dynasty was founded around 235 AD and its fall in about 255 AD
 kaling ke shaasha kharkhel ke rajyakaal main utkeern hathi gumpha shilaalekh ke aadhaar par rapasan satvaahan vansh kaa armbh 220 i0purv tathaa 211 i0purv ke bich maanate he parantu satvahanon ke yasana kaal ko lekar vibhinn puraanon main bhi mataantar he
 On one hand, where the Matsya Purana states their total Yasan period is 460 years, on the other hand, in Brahmapuran this period is stated to be 456 years

 Bhandarkar considers the establishment of the Satavahana dynasty as early as 72

 puraanon main varnit ek vaktavy ke aadhaar par unhone yah mana he ki, ‘‘shunga mrity’’ kanv shaasha shunga shaskaon ke sevak the tathaa peshwaon kii bhaanti unke saath-saath shashan karte the tathaa simuk athwa shishuk naamak satvaahan vansh ke sansthaapak ne kanv raja sushraman ko markar kanv tathaa shunga dono vansho kaa ant kar diya tathaa unke samrajya ko apane aadhin kar liya
 But this fact is unbelievable because we know very well that the rulers of Sunga and Kanva dynasty never ruled jointly and Vasudeva Kanva, the founder of Kanva dynasty, took over the reins of the reign by killing the last Sunga ruler Devbhuti
 vayupurana ke us vaktavy jiske aadhaar par dobhandarkar ne galat vyakhya kii he, ko doray choudhary ne sahi bhang se paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, this dirty volume tells this much that when Simuk ended the Kanva dynasty and established the Satavahana dynasty, he also abolished the Sunga rulers who remained after the defeat of the Sunga rulers at the hands of the Kanva dynasty
 
 atev satvaahan shaskaon ne 29 i0purv main kanv vansh kaa ant kar swayan shashan kii bagdor sanbhali
 But notwithstanding all these factors one cannot deny the possibility that Simuk, who ruled for 23 years, would have been enthroned sometime back i
e
 in the middle of the first century BCE
 simuk satvaahan vansh kaa sansthaapak tha tathaa usne 235 i0pus0 se lekar 212i0pus0 tak lagbhag 23 varshon tak shashan kiya
 Although we do not get much information about it, it is known from the Puranas that by destroying the power of the Kanva rulers and suppressing the remaining Sunga chiefs, he laid the foundation of the Satavahana dynasty
 puraanon main use simec ke atirikt shishuk, sindhuk tathaa shiprak aadi naamon se bhi pukaara gaya he
 According to Jain observers, Simuk built Jain and Buddhist temples during his reign, but at the end of his reign, he was stunned and cruel due to which he was removed and murdered
 simuk kii mrityu ke pashchaat uskaa chota bhai kanha rajgaddi par baitha
 During his 18-year tenure, Kanha adopted the policy of empire expansion
 nasik ke shilaalekh se yah pataa chalata he ki kanha ke samay main satvaahan samrajya pashchim main nasik tak fail gaya tha
 After shatkarni-i Kanha, Shatkarni ascended the first throne
 puraanon ke anusaar vah kanha putr tha
 But Dr
 Gopalachari considers Simuk as the father of Shatkarni I
 kuch vidwaanon ne yah mana he ki iskaa shashan kaal maatra do varsh rahaa parantu nilkantha shastri ne uskaa shashan kaal 194 i0pus0 se lekar 185 i0pus0 mana he
 However, it is clear that his reign was not very long
 parantu chota hote hue bhi shatakarni pratham kaa kaarykaal kuch drushtikonon se bada mahatvapurn he
 He was the first among the Satavahana rulers who named him by the word "shatkarni", beloved and popular among the rulers of this dynasty
 nanaghat shilaalekh ke anusaar shatakarni ne apane samrajya kaa khub vistaar kiya tathaa apane kaary kaal main do ashwamegh yajna tathaa ek rajasuy yajna kiya
 From an inscription of her queen Nayanika, we learn that Shatkarni i conquered western Malwa as well as Anup and Vidarbha regions
 yadi shatakarni pratham hi vah shaasha he jiskaa ullekh sanchi stupa ke torana main hua he to yah bhi is baat ko pramanit karata he ki uske samay main madhya bharat satvahanon ke adhikaar main tha
 He became the emperor during his work with his umbrellas and he took the titles like Dakshin Pathapati and the Untamed Chakra etc
 nanaghat lekh tathaa hathi gumpha lekhon main prayukt lipi kii samanta ke aadhaar par hi yah sujhaayaa gaya he ki kadaachit isi shatakarni shaskaon ke shashan kaal ke duusare varsh main kaling ke mahaan shaasha kharkhel ne yuddh kshetra main haraaya tha
 Shatkarni I's wife Nayanika or Naganika was the daughter of a maestro, Tranakairo, of Angiyan clan
 shatakarni pratham kii mrityu ke pashchaat uske do alpavyask putr vedashri tathaa satshri singhaasana par baithe
 But being a minor, the administration took the reins of his mother Nayanika, who ruled with the help of her father
 aisa prathit hota he ki vedashri kii alpaayu main hi mrityu ho gai tathaa satshri ne uske uttaradhikari ke rup main shashan sambhala
 But the Puranas are unanimous that after Satakarni I, a king named Purnotsang sat on the throne Satavahana
 chaahe chaturth satvaahan shaasha kaa naam kuch bhi rahaa ho, yah to nishchit he ki is shaasha ke shashan kaal main hi pushyamitra shunga ne antim maury shaasha brahadrath ko maar kar magadh rajya par adhikaar kar liya tha
 In Matsyapuran, Skandastambhi is mentioned as the fifth ruler of the Satavahana dynasty but most scholars consider this name to be fictitious
 shatakarni dwitiya ne lagbhag 166 i0pus0 se lekar 111 i0pus0 tak shashan kiya
 It was probably the same ruler who is mentioned in the inscriptions Heathigumpha and Bhilsa
 yah prathit hota he ki iske shashan kaal main satvahanon ne purvi malwa ko pushyamitra shunga ke ek uttaradhikari se chin liya
 According to the Puranas, after Shatkarni II, Lambodar ascended the throne
 lambodar ke pashchaat uskaa putr apilak gaddi par baitha
 Appellant who was the eighth Satavahana ruler, the period between these two is considered to be the dark age in the context of Satavahanas in which only the period of Kuntal Shatakarni can be considered as an exception
 kuntal shatakarni, apilak ke pashchaat satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatvapurn shaasha tha
 In the Kamasutra, Vatsyayan mentions Kuntal Shatkarni, writing that he used his fingers as a scissor and that his patrani Malayavati died from the stroke
 kawyaminmasha main rajeshwar ne kuntal shatakarni kaa varnan karte hue kaha he ki usne apane ranivas main rahane vaali apni raniyon ko yah aadesh diya tha ki ve keval praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karen
 Hall was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi usne keval chaar varsh hi shashan kiya tathaapi kuch vishyon uskaa shashan kaal bahut mahatvapurn rahaa
 It is believed that if Shatkarni was the greatest as the first warrior among the early Satavahana rulers, Hall was a pioneer as a peacekeeper
 haal saahitiyik abhiruchi bhi rakhata tha tathaa ek kavi samraat ke rup main prakhyat hua
 His name is mentioned in the Puranas, Lilavati, Saptashati, Abhidhan Chintamani etc
 yah mana jaataa he ki praakrit bhashaa main likhi gaatha saptshati athwa satsai kaa rachiyata haal hi tha
 Gunadhya, the author of Brihatkatha, was also a recent contemporary and probably composed this book written in Paisachi language under his recent patronage
 kalaantar main buddhaswami kii brihadakatha‘yalok-sangrah, kshemendra kii brihadakatha-manjari tathaa somdev kii kathasaritasagar naamak teen granthon kii utpati gunanty kii brihadakatha se hi hui
 The recent commander-in-chief Vijayanand invaded and conquered Sri Lanka on the orders of his master

 There Vijayanand heard the discussion of Lilavati, the very beautiful daughter of the King of Sri Lanka, whom she described from her King Hall
 haal ne prayaas kar leelavati se vivaah kar liya
 Legend has it that some military operations were carried out in the eastern Deccan, but due to lack of evidence, most scholars consider it wrong
 yadhyapi haal tak ke satvaahan shaskaon ke shasankaal main rajnatik kshetra ke atirikt saahitiyik tathaa aarthik kshetron main bhi atyaadhik vikaas hua tathaa vyapaar-vaanijya shaharon ke vikaas evam jalaparivahan kii unnati hui jo ki pratham shatabdi i0 ke duusare mundalak athwa puridransen ke shashan kaal main apane utkarsh kii paraakaashtha par pahunch gai, tathaapi aane vaale lagbhag pachaas varsh satvaahan samrajya ke liye bade hi kathin sabit hue
 It seemed as if the Satavahana Empire was about to collapse with the foreign invasion of the West Satraps
 kushaan uttar-pashchim main apana prasar kar rahe the tathaa unke dabaav main shaq tathaa pehlaav shaasha madhya tathaa pashchimi bharat kii ore aakarshith hokar satvahanon se sangharsh karne ko aatur the
 The Western Kshatrapas of the Kshatra dynasty had established themselves in Paschima Rajputana, Gujarat and Kathiawar
 in shaq shaskaon ne 35 i0 se lekar lagbhag 90i0 tak satvaahan rajya par akraman kiye
 He conquered the eastern and Paiyachma Malwa territories by the Satavahanas; Northern Konkan also dominated northern Maharashtra, which was the center of the Satavahana power and extended to southern Banavasi
 kshahraat vansh kaa pehla shaasha ghumak tha jisaki jaankaree ke strot kuch sikken he jo ki adhikanshtah gujarat kathiyawad ke tateey pradesh tathaa yadakada malwa se paae hai
 Ghoomak's successor was Nahapan, whose information we hold on his majority of coins is the title of king
 vahiin shilalekhon uski oopaadhi kshatrap tathaa mahakshatrap mili
 His inscriptions of Nashik, Karle and Junar; All of the donations made by SK majority coins and his Jamta Shak Ashwadat in northern and southern India testify that the empire of the Kshatra dynasty was very vast at the time of Nahapan and that it had taken away a large territory from the Satavahana rulers
 Was made so huge
 nahpaan tathaa uske jamata shaq ashavdath ne malwa, narmada ghati, uttari konkan, baraar kaa pashchima bhaag evam or dakshini maharashtra ko jitkar pashchimi dakkan main satvaahan shakti ko lrabhr ukhaad phanka
 The Satavahana kings who were defeated at the hands of Nahapan were probably the beautiful Shatakarni, Chakor Shatkarni and Sivasati, whose tenure was very short, but this situation did not last long and as the Satavahana ruler of Gautami son Sri Shatakarni became the new ruler in this quasi-satavahana struggle Turned
 lagbhag aadhi shatabdi kii uthapatak tathaa shaq shaskaon ke haathon manamardan ke baad gautami putr shri shatakarni ke netritv main apni khoi hui pratishtha ko purnsthapit kar liya
 Gautami's son Sri Shatkarni was the greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, who ruled for nearly 25 years, not only restored the lost prestige of his empire but also established a vast empire
 gautami putr ke samay tathaa uski vijayon ke baaren main hamen uski mata gautami balashri ke nasik shilalekhon se sampoorn jaankaree milti he
 Gautamiputra Satkarni is also considered by some experts to be King Shalivahana
 unhone puure bharat ko ekajute kar diya or videshi hamalaavaron ke khilaaf bachaaya
 In this context, we get information from this article that he has made the ego of Kshatriyas honorable
 uskaa varnan shaq, yavan tathaa pehlaav shasaskon ke vinaash karta ke rup main hua he
 His greatest achievement was the defeat of Shaka ruler Nahapan of the Kshatra dynasty and his descendants at his hands
 jogalthambi samuh se praapt nahpaan ke chandi ke sikken jinhe ki gautami putr shatakarni ne dubaara dhalvaaya tathaa apane shashan kaal ke atharahawein varsh main gautami putr dwaara nasik ke nikat pandu-len main guhaadaan karnaa- ye kuch aise tathy he jon yah pramanit karaten he ki usne shaq shaskaon dwaara chhine gaye pradeshon ko purnvijit kar liya
 His war with Nahapan took place in the 17th and 18th years of his reign, and after winning this war, the son of Gagatami abducted, Anoop, Saurashtra, Kukar, Akar and Avanti from being drunk
 in kshetron ke atirikt gautami putr kaa rishik, ayamak, mulak tathaa vidarbha aadi pradeshon par bhi adhipaty tha
 The area under its direct influence extended from Malwa and Kathiawar in the north to the Krishna River in the south and from Berar in Puwa to Konkan in the west
 usne 'tri-samudra-toy-pit-vaahan' oopaadhi dhaaran kii jisase yah pataa chalata he ki uskaa prabhaav purvi, pashchimi tathaa dakshini sagar arthath bengal kii khadi, arab sagar evam hind mahaasaagar tak tha
 It seems that shortly before his death, the territories won by Gautami's son Shatkarni defeated Nahapan and passed away
 gautami putr se in pradeshon ko chhinane vaale sambhawatah sithian jati ke hi karadaamak vansh ke shaq shaasha the
 We find evidence of this by Talmi from his book describing geography
 aisa hi nishkarsh 150 i0 ke prasiddh rudradaman ke junagarh ke shilaalekh se bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 This inscription shows that Rudradaman captured all the territories of Gautamiputra Shatkarni, who had been conquered by Nahapan
 aisa prathit hota he ki gautamiputra shatakarni ne karadaamak shakon se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar rudradaman dwaara hathiyaae gaye apane kshetron ko surakshit karne kaa prayaas kiya

 jis samay bharat main bhagwaan mahavir or buddha dharm ke sambadh main nae vichaar rakh rahen the, china main bhi ek sudhaarak kaa janm hua, jiskaa naam kanceyushious tha
 At that time, the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou Dynasty was going on in China
 samay ke saath jhou rajvansh kii shakti shithil padane ke kaaran china main bahut se rajya kaayam ho gayi, jo sadaa aapas main ladate rahete the, jise jhagadate rajyon kaa kaal kaha jane laga
 Therefore, the people of China were suffering a lot
 aise samay main china vaasiyon ko naitikta kaa paath padhaane hetu mahatma kanceyucious kaa aavirbhaav hua
 He was born in Shandong region of China, about 550 years before the birth of Jesus Christ
 bachapan main hi unke pita kii mrityu ho gai
 The aspiration for his knowledge was limitless
 bahut adhik ksht karke unhen gyaan arjan karnaa padaa tha
 At the age of 17, he got a government job
 kuch hi varshon ke baad sarkari naukari chhodkar ve shikshan kaary main lag gayi
 He started giving education to students by opening a school at home
 ve maukhik rup se vidhyaarthiyon ko itihaas, kavy or nitishastra kii shiksha dete the
 He wrote several books on poetry, history, music and ethics
 53 varsh kii umr main lu rajya main ek shahar ke ve shashankarta tathaa baad main ve mantri pad par niyukt hue
 As a minister, he emphasized on the improvement of human character in lieu of punishment
 kanceyucious ne apane shishyon ko satya, prem or nyaay kaa sandesh diya
 He used to put more emphasis on virtue
 ve logon ko vinayi, paropkaaree, guni or charitravaan banane kii prerana dete the
 ve bado env purvajon ko aadar-sammaan karne ke liye kehete the
 ve kehete the ki dusron ke saath vaisaa vartav na karo jaisaa tum swany apane saath nahin karnaa chaahate ho
 Confucius was a reformer, not a preacher
 unhone ishwar ke bare main koi upadesh nahin diya, parantu phir bhi baad main log unhen dharmik guru maanane lage
 He died in 480 BC i was done kanceyucious ke samaaj sudhaarak upadeshon ke kaaran chini samaaj main ek sthirataa aayi
 Confucius's philosophy remains a pioneer for Chinese education even today
 kanfushas ne kabhi bhi apane vichaaron ko likhit rup dena aavashyak nahin samajha
 He believed that he could be the bearer of ideas, not his creator
 vah puraatatv kaa upaask tha, kayonki uskaa vichaar tha ki usee ke madhyam se yatharth gyaan praapt praapt ho saktaa he
 He said that man can get rules for all his activities within himself
 na keval vyakti ke liye varan sampurna samaaj ke sudhaar or sahi vikaas ke niyam or swaroop pracheen mahatmaon ke shabdon evam kaarysheleyon main praapt ho sakate hai
 Confucius did not leave an article that represented the principles of moral and social order propounded by him
 kintu uske pautra tje sje dwaara likhit 'ausat kaa siddhant' or uske shishy tsong sin dwaara likhit 'mahan shiksha' naamak pustakon main tatsambandhi samast suchnaayen praapt hoti hai
 a treatise called 'spring and Autumn', which is also called the chronicle of Lu, is said to be written by Confucius
 yah samoochee kriti praapt he or yadhyapi bahut choti he tathaapi china ke sankshipt itihaason ke liye adarsh maani jaati he
 Overall, the number of Confucius disciples had reached 3,000, but nearly 75 of them were highly talented scholars
 uske param priy shishy uske paas hi rahaa karte the
 They used to rise and sit around him reverently and pay attention to the subtle features of his conduct and he would meditate and meditate on every word of speech coming out of his mouth
 ve usase pracheen itihaas, kavy tathaa desh kii samjik prathaon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Confucius said that good governance and peace can be established in a country only when the ruler, minister and every person of the public continue to perform the proper duties in their place
 shaasha ko sahi artho main shaasha hona chahie, mantri ko sahi artho main mantri hona chahie
 The Confucius was once asked that if he was given the responsibility of running the governorship of a state, then he would do the first important work
 iske liye uskaa uttar tha– 'naamon main sudhaar'
 This meant that the name of the post on which he is eminent should duly perform all the duties attached to the post so that his name is meaningful
 use udhaaharan or adarsh kii shakti main purna vishwaas tha
 He believed that the common people certainly bow down to the examples which the ideal person presents with his good conduct
 yadi kisi desh ke shaasha ko iskaa bhalee bhanti gyaan kara diya jaae ki use shashan kaary chalaane main kya karnaa chahie or kis prakaar karnaa chahie to nishchay hi vah apana udhaaharan prastut karke aam janata ke aacharan main sudhaar kar saktaa he or apane rajya ko sukhi, samrudh evam sampann bana saktaa he
 On the basis of this belief, the Confucius declared that if a ruler made him his chief counselor for 12 months, he could show a lot and if he was given three years, he could embody his ideals and hopes
 Can provide
 kanfushas ne kabhi is baat kaa daawa nahin kiya ki use koi daivi shakti yaa ishwariya sandesh praapt hote the
 He used to think only about what is a person and what are his duties in society
 usne shaktipradarshan, asaadhaaran evam ammanushik shaktiyon, vidroh pravriti tathaa devi devataaon kaa zikr kabhi nahin kiya
 His statement was that it is a matter of intelligence that every person should perform his duty with full accountability and honesty and keep separate from them even while honoring the Gods and Goddesses
 uskaa mat tha ki jo manushya maanav kii seva nahin kar saktaa vah devi devataaon kii seva kya karegaa
 He had full attention for all duties of himself and others, which is why he said that a bad man can never be able to rule, no matter how powerful he is
 niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaalon ko to shaasha dand detaa hi he, parantu use kabhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki uske sadacharan ke adarsh prastut karne kii shakti se badhkar anya koi shakti nahin he
 The philosophy based on philosophical, social and political views of Confucianism is called Confucianism or Kungphutism

 a function point is a unit through which an information system facilitates its user to perform business tasks

 The FSM method of IFPUG is an ISO approved modulus measure through which the size of the information system is measured based on the features provided to the user

 The IFPUG FSM method is one of the five standards for measuring activity on a work-by-day basis approved by ISO standards
 kaary bindu ibiem ke alan albract dwaara 1979 main "upkarnon ke prati ek nayaa paripekshya" ke jariye paribhaashit kiye gaye the
 The working user requirements of the software are explored and then each is divided into five types - provide, query, input, internal files and external interface
 ek baar kaary kii pahchaan kar ke uskaa prakaar nirdhaarit hone par usee jatilta aanki jaati he or tadnusaar kuch kaary bindu pradaan kiye jate hai
 Every work related user requirement is directly related to a user's business related work, for example a content entry for a query or a query by a user for an inquiry
 yah isliye zaruri he kyonki iske jariye kaary binduon main naape gaye kaaryon ko saralata se prayokta-kendrit aavashyaktaaon ke taur par samajha ja saktaa he, par isse aantarik kaaryakalapon chhip jate hai, haalaanki inako lagu karne main bhi sansaadhan to lagenge hi
 Over the years, several methods have been suggested to deal with this perceived weakness, but there is no iso-validated FSM method that outlines the complexity of the algorithm in measurement
 is se nipatane ke liye albract aadhaarit iepapiuji vidhi se kuch bhinn vidhiyaan bhi hai: The method of measuring the size of an information system and expressing it in action points is called action point analysis
 is vidhi main sudhaar lagaataar hote rahen iske liye vaishvik sahyogi affpie prayokta samooh, jaise ki enieseme va iepapiuju kaam karte rahete hai
 Function point analysis expresses the functional size of an information system in the number of task points
 kaary binduon ke prayog ke kai laabh hai or kaaryaatmak aakaar kaa prayog kai prakaar kii pariyojnaon va sanghathan sambandhi nirnyon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he jaise ki: Many organizations measure action points to different accuracy levels, depending on what purpose the size of the string is ultimately being measured
 affpie kaa prayog soochna pranali ke pareekshan prayaas kaa pataa lagane ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he;iskaa sutara he pareekshan maamle = 1
2 Systems are measured from a functional perspective through action points
 prayukt takanic se isamen koi fark nahin padataa he
 Whatever the language, development method or mechanics, the number of function points of a system will not change
 yadi badalegaa to keval un kaary binduon ke nirmaan main laga prayaas
 There are two types of work related user requirements - content work and transaction work
 inhen iepapiuji va enieseme ethesam vidhi ne 5 prakaaron main vibhajit kiya he or inke aadhaar par kaary bindu pradaan kiye jate hai
 Content Functions → Internal Logical Files: User valid, group of logically related content Example: Accumulated employee content in an employee file
 saamagree kaary → bahya antaraprishth filein: taarkik rup se sambandhit saamagree, keval sandarbh ke liye, saamagree anuprayog ke baahar rahati he 
 The external interface file will be an internal logical file for another file
 udhaaharan: kisi company dwaara apni pranali ke baahar saajha kii gai saamagree
 Transaction Functions → External Interchange: Retrieve content from outside and store it in internal logical file
 udhaaharan - prayokta jodna, karmchaaree jodna
 The validation of material in this transaction is not external exchange
 udhaaharan ke liye dak panjikaran apane aap main bahya aadan nahin he
 There are many transactions in it such as confirmation of postal address, checking availability of postal address and submission of material
 keval antat saamagree jamaa karnaa hi bahya aadan he
 The rest will be external questions
 lenden kaary → bahya pradaan: isamen aantarik saamagree baahar jaati he or yah saamagree, gananoparant praapt saamagree he
 Examples: Tax calculation, Income calculation Transaction → External question: External content comes in but it is not stored in internal logical files
 aantarik saamagree baahar jaati he lekin bina kisi gananaa ke
 Example: Checking the ATM to get information about the employee through a question
 kaary binduon va kai anya tantransh maapkon kii aalochana hui he, ki ise prayog main laane main lage kharch or pechidagi ke mukaable iske laabh bahut kam hai
 The effort involved in calculating action points is only a partial error subtraction, due to the fact that most of the variance in cost estimates for the system does not fall under it (such as business changes, range changes, unplanned resource constraints or Change in priorities etc
 saathi hi yadi is maap kaa prayog karke yah nirnay lenaa ho ki is tantransh main nivesh kiya jaae yaa nahin, to yah tark diya jaataa he ki laagat ke bajaay tantransh ke laabh ko naapnaa chahie
 Applied information economics, which calculates the economic values of these measurements, often prompts users to spend measurement efforts on other issues
 kuch takneekee aalochanaayen yahan prakashit hui hai - parivartan binduen: tantransh utpaadakta maap kaa prastaav, "pranali tantransh dainiki, khand 31, sitambar 1995, vernan ve chatman tritiy dwaara"

 “apane kariyar kaa nirmaan kar rahe logon ko ve nahin ke baraabar tankhwaah dete hai”
 “unki hameshaa se yahi niti rahi he”
 The article also commented on the dwindling popularity of the food network, whose daily preference according to it had "fallen from 580,000 a year earlier to an average of 544,000 people"
 She noted, "more importantly, the group indicative of their weekend's educational programs, collectively known as 'in the Kitchen', lost 15 percent of their last year's audience , Which now averages 830,000
 iske kaaran network ko vigyapakon ko paise waapas, jise ‘bharpai karnaa’ kehete hai, karnaa pad rahaa he”
 Erica Gruen, former president and CEO of Food Network, who produced Emeril Live during her tenure, was told that the increased competition was responsible for the decline, saying "all types of educational response videos are available on the web"
 lekin usne bataaya ki, “phud network ke kaarykram-niyojan or nirmaan ke varisht upaadhyaksh bob tascoman ne kaha, saptahanth kii variyata main giravat koi aisi baat nahin he ki ‘jisaki hamane aashaa nahin kii thi’
 unhone kaha ki us samyavadhi main network kii variyata pichley chaar varshon main har varsh do ankon se badi thi, jo aisi pragati he jise banaae rakhana asambhav he”

 These contracts were 'far more weighty' from the stars' point of view, a person affected by the changing policy said
 david rojengarton kii vidaai bhi ameril lages ke samaan hi thi
 Erica Gruen, in the role of her book Test, stated that the program was the first self-produced production by Food Network and became her most popular program
