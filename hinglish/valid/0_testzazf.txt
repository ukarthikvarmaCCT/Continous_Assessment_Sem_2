 mcdonald Ashtavakra is a Hindi epic written in 2009 by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya
 is mahakavy main 108-108 padon ke aath sarg hai or is prakaar kul 864 pad hai
 The epic presents the story of the sage Ashtavakra, which is available in Hindu texts like Ramayana and Mahabharata
 mahakavy kii ek prati kaa prakaashan jagadguru rambhadracharya viklang vishvavidhyalay, chitrakoot, uttar pradesh dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The book was released on January 14, 2010, the day of the poet's Shashtipurti festival
 is kavy ke nayak ashtavakra apane sharir ke aathon angon se viklang hai
 The epic Ashtavakra presents the entire life journey of the sage, starting from crisis and going through success to his salvation
 mahakavi, jo swayan do maas kii alpaayu se pragnachakshu hai, ke anusaar is mahakavy main viklangon kii saarvbhaum samasyaon ke samaadhanatmak sutara prastut kiye gaye hai
 According to him, the eight cantos of the epic are merely analyzes of the eight attitudes of the disabled
 mahakavy main ashtavakra ke jivan kii katha varnit he, jiskaa aadhaar valmiki ramayana kaa yukand, mahabharat kaa van parv, ashtavakra gita evam bhawabhooti dwaara rachit uttarramcharitam naatak he
 The sage mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad is a disciple named Kahola of Uddālaka
 uddalak kahole ko apni putree sujatha vivaah main arpit karte hai or navvivaahit dampati ek jangal ke ashram main jivan-yaapan prarambh karte hai
 Sujata becomes pregnant after a few years
 garbhasth balak ek baar raatri main apane pita rishi kahole se kahata he ki uccharan karte samay prayek vaidic mantra main aath ashuddhiyaan kar rahe hai
 The enraged Kahola curses the child with eight limbs of being handicapped
 isi madhya jangal main akaal pad jaataa he or sujatha apane pati kahole ko kuch dhanarjan karne ke liye mithila main raja janak ke sameep bhejti hai
 a courtier named Janak's Bandi defeats Kahola in scripture and through Varunpash immerses the sage in water
 uddalak sujatha ko uske pati kii durdasha se avgat karaate hue is ghatana ko balak se gupt rakhane ko kehete hai
 Uddālaka names the baby born by Sujāta as Ashtavakra
 usee samay, uddalak ke bhi ek putr kaa janm hota he, jiskaa naam shwethaketu rakhaa jaataa he
 Ashtavakra and Shvetketu grow up like brothers and study the scriptures from Uddālaka
 ashtavakra uddalak ko apana pita evam shwethaketu ko apana bhai samajhataa he
 But at the age of ten, knowing that his father is in captivity, he decides to go to Mithila to free his father
 ashtavakra apane mamaa shwethaketu ke sahit mithila kii yatra karte hai or kramshah dwarpal, raja janak or bandi ko shastrarth main haraakar apane pita kahole ko varunapash se mukt karaate hai
 On the way home, Maharishi Kahola bathes Ashtavakra in the Samanga River and by his tapabal frees him from the eight disabilities of his body
 ant main, vashishtha muni kii prerana par ashtavakra sita evam ram ji ke rajdurbar main padhaarte hai or ayodhya kii rajsabha main sammanit kiye jane par anand kaa anubhav karte hai
 The story of the eight cantos is summarized below - kavi kehete hai ki is kavy kii vidha krantvaad he
 In the second canto, Mahakavi defines the Samyak Revolution, saying that such a revolution can only be accomplished by a change in thoughts
 ashtavakra kahole se vaartalap karte hue kehete hai ki “ shaanti” vridhon ke liye samuchit puraatan udghoshnaa he or adhyatan yuvavarg hetu “ kranti” kii nutan udghoshnaa honi chahie
 पर On the basis of the lines of peace chant, Mahakavi presents new mantra through Ashtavakra to convene the revolution everywhere
 dyuh krantih nabhah krantih bhagyabhumabhumi krantih
 His Holiness you: revolution: oesthi: be transitional
 Navavanaspitvriand Kranti: Vishwadevaspand Kranti
 mahakavyachhand krantih brahmabhav sakrantimay ho 
 According to Hindi scholar Shri BN Mishra, in classical tradition, the names of the cantos of the epics are not started with the letters sh, sh, s and ha
 unka mat he ki yahan mahakavi ne sabhi sargon ke naam sa se prarambh karke shastreey li se hatakar naveen path kaa nirmaan kiya he
 In the epic, the poet derives the name Ashtavakra - Ashta meaning eight and Avakra means devoid of curvature or directly - with a treaty of words
 is sandhiviched ke aadhaar par ashtavakra shabd kii paanch vyakhyaayein 1
98 se 1
100 padyon main prastut kii gai hai
 In the epic, verses related to philosophy are visible at many places
 tritiy sarg main ashtavakra ke swagatakathan main veydant kii vishishtadvait shakha ke anusaar aatma ke swabhaav kaa nirupan karne vaale padya praapt hote hai
 a part of the sermon given by Uddālaka to Ashtavakra under the sixth canto gives the same subject
 in shlokon main prayukt shabdaawalee veda, upanishad evam shrimadbhagavadgita main prayukt shabdaawalee ke samaan hi he
 a metaphor presented in the interpretation of Sadhana presents a mixture of all the six theistic branches of Hindu philosophy — Samkhya, Yoga, Vaisesika, Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 saptam sarg main jab ashtavakra mithila main pravesh karte hai, ve samast shaddarshanon ke vidwaanon ko vahaan pate hai 
 Many branches of Vedanta philosophy are also described with devotion to the seventh branch
 padya 8
4 hindu darshan main vishwa kii utpatti ke sambandh main vibhinn vichaardhaaraon kaa varnan karata he- kuch ise shabd se nirmit maanate hai to kuch kehete hai ki yah yaa to parinaam he athwa vivart he
 Poets accept the first concept
 mahakavy ke anek sandarbhon main, bharat evam vishwa se sambandhit vibhinn samakaleen saamaajik samasyaon par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 Problems are presented in the epic through the autobiography of the characters or through dialogues between them
 in samasyaon main kanyaon ke viruddh pakshpaat, aarakshan evam yogyata, viklangon kii dasha aadi anek mudde shaamil hai
 For many cultural and economic reasons, girls have historically been victims of discrimination in Indian society
 putron ke liye praathamikta or kanya-shishuon ke prati pakshpaat aaj bhi jari he, jo ki bal ling anupaat or striyon main alp sakshartaa dar ke aankadon se pratyaksh parilakshith hota he
 Poets raise the problem of gender inequality in the first and fifth canto of the epic
 uddalak or kahole ke samvaad ke sandarbh main pratham sarg se nimna padya uddhrut he, jisamen uddalak kahole ko sujatha ke janm kii soochna dete hue kehete hai– Girl is not a burden, Shirka is the creation of this world, makeup is the mantra of humanity, this is the gift of nature
 kokh pavitra sutaa se hoti putree se grih hota shuddh nahin bhrunahatya vidhey he shrutiviruddh yah krity ashuddh 
 Reservation in educational institutions and social sector and its proposal for private sector is a controversial and much discussed issue in India
 haal hi main, vibhinn jati or dharmik samoohon ne shikshan sansthaanon evam / athwa saamaajik kshetra main aarakshan kii maang kii he, jisase adhikanshtah asantosh, virodh evam nyaaypalika or vidhansabha ke madhya vivaad hi ubhar kar sammukh aae hai
 In verse 5
40 in the fifth canto of the epic, Uddālaka talks to himself, comparing the learning abilities of the disabled Ashtavakra with the abilities of केvetaketu and other disciples - pratibh kshetra main aarakshan na kadaapi rashtrahit main samuchit
 This grossly disrespectful talent's path of decadence is extremely inappropriate
 viklangon ke prati pakshpaat evam bhedbhaav ke mudde ko mahakavy main anek sandarbhon main uthaaya gaya he
 In the first canto, in the dialogue between Uddālaka and Kahola, Uddālaka states that after the success of Ashtavakra, the disabled will no longer be deprived of their rights by society
 unase ab or adhik anuchit laabh nahin uthaaya jayega, ve shubh sanskaron par apshakun nahin samajhe jaaenge or unke saath samanta kaa vyavhaar kiya jayega
 In the fourth canto, talking to Sujatha, Uddālaka says that the notion that the disabled are a burden on the family and are neglectful - will destroy the world
 ve viklangon ke apmaan evam tiraskaar ke viruddh chetavanee dete hue unke saath sammanjanak vyavhaar karne kaa paraamarsh dete hai, anyathaa viklangon ke ashrubindu unhen peedit karne waalon ko vajra ke samaan banakar dandit kar sakate hai
 In the seventh canto, in Ashtavakra's autobiography, the poet says that making the disabled a character of humor is never expedient, because they too are the work of the artisan who created the whole creation
 ek padya udhaaharan ke rup main prastut he– What is the handicap of the family, what neglect of the family is that of the disabled
 jagat ko jarjarit kar degi jhatiti yah visham avadharana kusamaaj kii 
 The principal Ras of the epic are Veer and Karun Ras
 apane pita ke shaap ke pashchaat ashtavakra kaa swagatakathan, kahole kaa shaap dene ke uparant pashchaatap tathaa kahole ko jal main dubo die jane ke pashchaat uddalak evam sujatha ke madhya vaartalap–dayaa evam karunaa se ot-prot prasang hai
 Ashtavakra's determination and resolve to free his father and his Mithila Yatra are notable episodes full of heroic rasa
 yamak sanskrit main ek aisa alankaar he, jahaan ek shabd anek baar prayukt hota he or prayek baar us shabd kaa arth bhinn hota he
 An example of Yamak mixed alliteration ornamentation in the epic is in the second half of verse 7
32
 ang ang par vilas rahe the lalitlalam vibhushan bhawabhooshan dooshanripudushandooshan nimiculbhushan
 In the second half of verse 1
21, poets use the words "raurav" and "gaurav" four and three times in the same line respectively, each time they have different meanings
 rauravasahit rahit raurav se rauravakrut jitaraurav the gauravmay abhimaan vivarjit shritgaurav hitgaurav the 
 At many places in the epic, poets use linguistic ornamentation, where Sanskrit and Hindi are mixed together
 is prakaar ke padya kaa ek udhaaharan, jisamen nirukt ke aadhaar par sujatha naam kii vyutpatti kii gai he, yahan prastut he– Subhago Jato Yasya: Saiva Sujata Name Nirukti This is the Ashtavakra Subhaj Jataka made Sujata Matu right
 mudra alankaar ke antargat, padya rachana ke liye prayukt chand kaa- uske naam kaa padya main ullekh kar- sanket kiya jaataa he
 The last verse of the third canto of the Ashtavakra epic is composed in the verse "shardulvikriditam" and uses the word "shardulvikriditam"
 ashtavakra maharishi vaakya kah rahe jyon ho rahe maun the tyon hi bipra kahole ke nayan bhi nirandhravarshi bane
 Limitless Vedavidhi was also completed, Sing God Dev all Kaholsut's Shardul Vikriditam
 apane sanskrit mahakavy shribhargavaraghaviyam main, kavi rambhadracharya ne is alankaar kaa aath sthanon par prayog kiya he
 Four conversations are described in the seventh and eighth cantos of the epic
 inamen pratham vaartalap ashtavakra evam raja janak ke madhya hota he or ashtavakra ke tej evam aatmavishvaas ko prastut karata he
 The remaining three conversations involve debates attesting to Ashtavakra's scholarship, including being satisfied with the first gatekeeper to obtain permission to enter the assembly, as answers to the esoteric questions of the second king Janaka, and the third prisoner and Ashtavakra
 The middle is in the form of scripture, in which the numbers from one to thirteen, which seem very ordinary, are in themselves Trnihit that dispels the mysteries and hidden meanings
 mahakavy ke ye vaartalap mahabharat ke samaan hi hai
 The comparison of these conversations described in the Sanskrit poetry of Mahabharata and Hindi poetry of Ashtavakra is remarkable
 madhya pradesh sahitya academy ke pathak samooh ne mahakavy kii samalochna hetu sitambar 2010 main ashokanagar main samikshakon ke ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya
 The principal critic, Professor SN Saxena, said that the epic is a saga of struggle to flourish and is a source of inspiration for the disabled due to the poet's own experiences
 sammelan main upasthit anya samikshakon main lekhak ramsevak soni, sudhir gupta, subhash jain saral evam pradeep manuria the
 Critics said that the epic represents the feelings of the disabled and their upliftment and is very relevant in the modern world
 madhya pradesh sahitya academy ne samikshakon ke anya sammelan kaa aayojan navambar 2010 main damoh main kiya, jisamen anek sahityakaron ne mahakavy par charchaa kii

 He was originally a resident of Kanpur, United States

 Without government assistance in those days, it was often impossible to run any letter
 company sarkaar ne mishnariyon ke patr ko to dak aadi kii suvidha de rakhi thi, parantu cheshtaa karne par bhi "udant martand" ko yah suvidha praapt nahin ho saki
 This paper used a mixed form of both Braj and Khadiboli which the operators of this paper called "madhya Pradesh language"
 praarambhik vijyapti is prakaar thi - "yah "udant martand" ab pehle-pahal hindustaniyon ke hit ke het jo aaj tak kisi ne nahin chalaaya par angreji o parsi o bengal main jo samachar kaa kaagaj chhapata he unka sukh un boliyon ke jaanane or padhane waalon ko hi hota he

 vah paidaa hue chah bacchon main tisare the

 According to a school master from Badnagar, Narendra, though an average student, was keenly interested in debates and drama competitions
 iske alaava uski ruchi raajnneetik vishyon par nayi-nayi pariyojnaayen prarambh karne kii bhi thi
 At the age of 13, Narendra was engaged to Jasoda Ben Chamanlal and when he was married, he was only 17 years old
 financial express kii ek khabar ke anusaar pati-patni ne kuch varsh saath rahakar bitaaye
 But after some time both of them became strangers to each other because Narendra Modi had expressed something similar to them
 jabaki narendra modi ke jeevani-lekhak aisa nahin maanate
 He says: "un donon kii shaadi jarur hui parantu ve donon ek saath kabhi nahin rahe
 After a few years of marriage, Narendra Modi left the house and in a way his marital life was almost finished
 " After being silent on his marital status in the last four assembly elections, Narendra Modi said that he had not committed any sin by informing him of being unmarried
 narendra modi ke mutabik ek shaadishuda ke mukaable avivaahit vyakti bhrashtachar ke khilaaf joardaar tareeke se lard saktaa he kyonki use apni patni, parivaar va balabachchon kii koi chintaa nahin rahati
 However, Narendra Modi has submitted his affidavit and accepted Jasodaben as his wife
 narendra jab vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr the tabhi se ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii shakha main niyamit jane lage the
 Thus his life began as a loyal campaigner of the Sangh
 He showed political activism from early life and played a major role in strengthening the base of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 gujarat main shankarasingh waghela kaa janaadhar majboot banane main narendra modi kii hi ranneeti thi
 In April 1990, when the era of mixed governments at the Center began, Modi's hard work paid off when the Bharatiya Janata Party formed a government with a majority of two-thirds in the 1995 assembly elections in Gujarat
 isi dauraan do rashtriya ghatnayen or is desh main ghatin
 The first incident was the rath yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya in which Narendra had the main support in Advani's chief charioteer's mumika

 2001 main keshubhai patel kii sehat bigadane lagi thi or bhaajapa chunaav main kai seat haar rahi thi
 After this, the National President of BJP puts Modi as the new candidate as the Chief Minister
 haalanki bhaajapa ke netaa laalkrishna adwani, modi ke sarkaar chalaane ke anubhav kii kami ke kaaran chintit the
 Modi turned down Patel's proposal to become the Deputy Chief Minister and asked Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee to give responsibility for Gujarat if they should not give it otherwise
 3 oktober 2001 ko yah keshubhai patel ke jagah gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane
 Along with this, he also had full responsibility for the election in December 2002
 narendra modi ne mukhyamantri kaa apana pehla kaarykaal 7 oktober 2001 se shuru kiya
 After this, Modi contested the Rajkot assembly election
 jisamen congress party ke asina mehta ko 14,728 maton se haraa diya
 Narendra Modi is known throughout the political circles for his unique lifestyle
 unke vyaktigat staff main keval teen hi log rahete hai, koi baari-bharkam amala nahin hota
 But everyone is familiar with the nature of Modi, who lives like a Karmayogi, so he does not face any problem in implementing his work
 unhone gujarat main kai aise hindu mandiron ko bhi dhwast karwaane main kabhi koi kotahi nahin barti jo sarkari kanoon kaayadon ke mutabik nahin bane the
 Although for this he had to become partisan of organizations like Vishwa Hindu Parishad, but he did not care about it even a little; Which kept them fit

 As a Chief Minister, Narendra Modi started the important schemes for the development of Gujarat and implemented them, a brief description of them is as follows- uparokt vikaas yojanaon ke atirikt modi ne adivasee va vanavaasi kshetra ke vikaas hetu gujarat rajya main vanabandhu vikaas hetu ek anya das sutri kaarykram bhi chalaa rakhaa he jiske sabhi 10 sutara nimnavat hai: 1-five lakh families employment, 2-quality of higher education, 3-economic development, 4-health, 5-housing, 6-clean clean drinking water, 7-irrigation, 8-overall electrification, 9-road in each season Route Availability and 10-urban Development

 The only information available on Porus is from Greek sources, though historians have argued that Porus was likely to be a descendant of the Puru tribe mentioned in the Rigveda, based on his name and location of his domain
 itihaaskaar ishwari prasad ne kaha ki poras yaduwanshi shorseni ho saktaa tha

 But historians do not know that Alexander was badly trapped after this crossing of the river Jhelum, because the river was flooded after crossing the river

 dhruv ne 13 varshon tak safaltaapurvak shashan karne ke baad sambhavat: apane jeevankaal main apane tisare or yogyatam putr govind ko 793 i
 ke aasapaas rajbhishikt kar diya
 Before that Govind was duly anointed on the Crown Prince
 iskaa kaaran tha ek ore dhruv kii apane govind ko rajdhikari banane kii ichha or duusari ore uskaa yah bhay ki uske bade ladke apana adhikaar paane ke liye uski mrityu ke baad kahin uttaradhikaar kaa yuddh na aarambh kar den
 At the same time Dhruva appointed his other sons as the provincial rulers of various regions of his empire
 parantu govind tritiy kii sainik yogyata or raajnneetik dakshata maatr se prabhavit hokar athwa apane pita ke dwaara uski rajgaddi kaa uttaradhikaar de diye jane se hi santusht hokar ve bhi chup baithanevaale na the
 Govind iii's eldest brother Pillar decided to try his power for succession after the death of his father Dhruva
 use kuch samant raajaaon kii bhi shah praapt ho gai, jinaki sankhya kuch rashtrakut abhilekhon main 12 bataai gai he
 At first, Govind III wanted to please the pillar like his other brothers, but he did not get any success and the war was going on in both
 govind ke chote bhai indra ne uski madad kii
 Pillar was defeated in the war, but Govind adopted a policy of softening towards him and appointed him as the administrator of Ganga state on his behalf
 rajgaddi par susthit hokar govind ne vidrohi saamanton ko dabaane or apni adhirajyashakti ke vistaar kii ore dhyaan diya
 The Ganga ruler Shivabhara was imprisoned by the Rashtrakutas, but after getting rid of the imprisonment, he showed a tendency towards freedom and tried to throw away the Rashtrakuta superintendence
 govind ne use turant parrast kiya, vah pun: bandi bana or gangawadi ko rashtrakut samrajya ke bheetar mila liya gaya
 Pillar was again appointed Governor of there
 tatpashchaat govind ne kanchi ke shaasha ko haraaya par uski vah vijay sthaayee na thi or thode hi dinon baad usekanchi par doosraa abhiyaan karnaa padaa
 Again, he attacked Vijayaditya, the eastern Chalukya ruler of Vengi, and forced him for his devotional service
 dakshin ke praaia: samast rajyon par apana aadhipaty jamaa lene ke baad govind ne uttar kii raajnneeti ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya
 His father Dhruva had defeated the Gurjara Pratihara ruler Vatsaraja and Palraj Dharmapala, and made a north India
 parantu uske baad uttar bhartiya rangamanch par anek nae drishy upasthit hue the
 Dharmapala succeeded in placing Chakrayudh as his nominee and Karad on the throne of Kanyakubja, but Nagabhatta II, the successor of Vatsaraja, immediately turned the dice and became the lord of Kannauj
 aisi hi parasthitiyon main govind tritiy ne uttar bhartiya raajnneeti main hastkshep kiya or apane vijayi abhiyaan prarambh kar die
 According to the skilled politician and skilled commander, before the campaigns, he had made complete arrangements for the security of his sides
 usee niti main usne indra ko malwa or gujarat main gurjar pratihaaron ke kisi aakasmik badhaav ko rokane ke liy rakh choda pashchaat nagabhatta or govind ke bich kahin bundelkhand main yuddh hua jahaan gurjar pratihaar senaaon ko munhaki khaani padi or nagabhatta ko swayan apni raksha ke liye kisi agyaat sthaan kii sharan leni padi
 Thereafter, Govind's forces advanced towards the Himalayas and on the way, Dharmapala and Chakrayudh also accepted his subjugation
 lautate samay bhi govind kii senaaon ne dakshin purvi madhyabhaarat evam bengal tathaa urisa ke anek kshetron ko jeeta
 But Govind's entire North Indian campaign was just Digvijay and had no special effect except for the increase in military prestige of the Rashtrakutas
 usase rashtrakut samrajya sena kii uttar main koi vruddhi na hui
 Its main reason was distance
 uske un abhiyaanon kaa samay ab praaia: 800-802 i
 ke bich mana jaataa he
 Retired from the North Indian campaigns, Govind once again displayed his military prowess in the South
 kaaran tha udhar ke kuch shaskaon main swatantraaa kii bhaavana kaa udai
 But before suppressing them, he had traveled towards Bharoch in western India, where the King of Sribhavan welcomed him
 shribhavan se vah dakshin kii ore badha
 The kings of Gangwadi, Kerala, Pandya, Chola and Kanchi did not form a military association against him, but in the battle they all lost and their innumerable military fields remained
 govind kii senaaon ne kanchi par kabja kar liya or pandya tathaa chol kshetron ko ronda
 The king of Sinhala was frightened by Govind's military successes and he too accepted his subjection
 spasht he ki govind tritiy rashtrakooton main atyadhik yogya or safal shaasha hua or vah apane samay kii dakshin tathaa uttar bhartiya raajnneeti ko samaan rup se prabhavit karata rahaa
 In terms of military and political prestige, he can be called the supreme ruler of contemporary India
 usne apane samay main rashtrakut rajvansh kii sabase adhik shrivriddhi kii or uski safaltaaon ke peeche uski nijee veerta, kootneetijyata or sanghatanshkti bharpoor maatra main lagi hui thi
 In this way, Govinda III died in 814 AD after ruling for 20 to 21 years with utmost merit and success

 kavy, kavita yaa padya, sahitya kii vah vidha he jisamen kisi kahani yaa manobhaav ko kalatmak rup se kisi bhashaa ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 The history of poetry and the philosophy of poetry in India is very old
 iskaa prarambh bharatmuni se samajha ja saktaa he
 Poetry literally means poetic composition or poet's work, which is duly tied in chains of verses
 kavy vah vaakya rachana he jisase chitt kisi ras yaa manoveg se purna ho
 That is, in which imagination and emotions are effected by the chosen words
 rasgangadhar main 'romantic' arth ke pratipadak shabd ko 'kavy' kaha he
 People also accept this symptom by understanding the elegance of the word under 'elegance of meaning'
 par 'arth' kii 'romaniyata' kai prakaar kii ho sakati he
 This symptom is not very clear from it
 sahitya darpanaakar vishwanath kaa lakshan hi sabase thik janchataa he
 According to him, 'the sentence is poetic'
 ras arthath manovegon kaa sukhad sanchaar kii kavy kii aatma he
 In poetry poetry there are three types of poetry, sound, quality satire and pictures
 dhwani vah he jis, main shabdon se nikle hue arth kii apeksha chipa hua abhipraay pradhan ho
 Qualified bangya is one in which there is secondary
 chitra yaa alankaar vah he jisamen bina byangy ke chamatkaar ho
 These three are also called Uttam, Madhyam and Adham respectively
 kavyprakashkar kaa jor chhipe hue bhav par adhik jaan padataa he, ras ke udrek par nahin
 Two more distinctions of poetry are made, epic and Khanda poetry
 mahakavy sargabaddh or uskaa nayak koi devtaa, raja yaa dhirodatt gunn sampann kshatriya hona chahie
 It should have any rasa pradhan from the adorned, heroic or quiet juices
 bich bich main karunaa; hasya ityadi or ras tathaa or or logon ke prasang bhi aane chahie
 There should be at least eight cantos
 mahakavy main sandhya, surya, chandra, raatri, prabhaat, mrugaya, parvat, van, ritu, sagar, sanyog, vipralambh, muni, poor, yajna, ranprayan, vivaah aadi kaa yathasthaan sannivesh hona chahie
 Poetry is considered to be of two types, visual and audio
 drishy kavy vah he jo abhinay dwaara dikhalaayaa jaay, jaise, naatak, prahasan, aadi jo padhane or sunen yogya ho, vah shravy he
 There are two types of audio poetry, prose and poetry
 padya kavy ke mahakavy or khandakavy do bhed kahe ja chuke hai
 There are also two distinctions of prose poetry - Katha and Akhyayika
 champu, virud or karambhk teen prakaar ke kavy or maane gaye he
 Generally, there are two distinctions of Sanskrit poetry - visual and audio
 drishy kavy shabdon ke atirikt paatro kii veshbhusha, bhavabhangima, akruti, kriya or abhinay dwaara darshakon ke hriday main rasonmesh karaata he
 Cinematography is also called 'metaphor' because it is decorated with the eyes
 shravy kavy shabdon dwaara pathakon or shrotaaon ke hriday main ras kaa sanchaar karata he
 In poetry, poetry, prose and champu poetry are included in the poetry
 gatyarthak main pad dhaatu se nishpan ‘padya’ shabd gati kii pradhanta suchit karata he
 Hence, there is a system of rhythm, rhythm and verses in the poetry
 pun: padyakavy ke do upbhed kiye jate hai—mahakavy or khandakavy
 Khandakavya is also called 'muktakavya'
 khandakavy main mahakavy ke samaan jivan kaa sampoorn itivrutt na hokar kisi ek ansh kaa varnan kiya jaataa he— They are also called 'gitikavya' in Hindi only because of their predominance of musicality along with poetry
 ‘geeti’ kaa arth hriday kii ragaatmak bhaavana ko chandobaddh rup main prakat karnaa he
 The soul of Geeti is Bhavatirek
 apni ragaatmak anubhuti or kalpana ke kavi varnyavastu ko bhavatmak bana detaa he
 In Gitikavya, personal experience is easily expressed by freeing it from poetic traditions and traditions
 swaroopat: geetikavy kaa aakaar-prakaar mahakavy se chota hota he
 With the help of all these elements, Sanskrit muktakavya is considered to be an excellent poem
 muktkavy mahakavyon kii apeksha adhik lokapriy hue hai
 In Sanskrit, Gitikavya is found in both Muktak and Prabandha forms
 prabandhatmak geetikavy kaa sarvotkrisht udhaaharan meghdoot he
 Most of the arrangements are written on the emulation of this song
 muktak vah hajisamen prayek padya apane aap main swatantra hota he
 Beautiful examples of this are Amarukashatak and Bhatruhrishtakatraya
 sangitamay chand madhur padaavalee geetikavyon kii visheshta he
 Adornment, policy, quietness and nature are its main contender
 nari ke soundarya or swabhaav kaa swaabhaavik chithran in kaavyon main miltaa he
 Sources of sermon, policy and public behavior are received in a very delightful way
 yahi kaaran he ki muktakaavyon main sukhtiyon or subhashiton kii prapti prachurtaa se hoti he
 The tradition of muktakavya is derived from the Vedic era in the form of spontaneous messages
 rugveda main sarama naamak kute ko sandesavahak ke rup main bhejne kaa prasang he
 Examples of Vedic muktakavavya are notable, such as the Sukta of Vasistha and Vamadeva
 ramayana, mahabharat or unke parvarti granthon main bhi is prakaar ke sfoot prasang vipul maatra main uplabdh hote hai
 Perhaps this sentiment has been in the form of encryption in the Shakodagars of Mahakavi Valmiki
 pativiyukta pravasini sita ke prati preshit shri ram ke sandeshvahak hanuman, duryodhana ke prati dharmraj yudhisthir dwaara preshit shrikrishna or sundari dayamanti ke nikat raja nal dwaara preshit sandesavahak hans isi parampara ke antargat gine jane vaale prasang hai
 In this context, the Bhagavata Purana's Venugita is particularly quotable, whose sultry image is inscribed on the Sanskrit Muktakayakas
 rajasekhar ne kavicharya ke prakaran main bataaya he ki kavi ko vidyaon or upavidyaon kii shiksha grahan kerani chaiye
 Grammar, dictionary, verses, and ornamentation - these are the four disciplines
 64 kalaayen hi upavidyaayein hai
 There are 8 sources of poetry - health, talent, practice, devotion, scholarly, polyandry, memento and raga
 mammat ne kavy ke chah prayojan bataaye hai- There is a very rich tradition of critics in Indian literature about what is poetry or poetry - from Sanskrit scholars like Acharya Vishwanath, Panditraj Jagannath, Pandit Ambikadatta Vyas, Acharya Shripati, Bhamah etc
 to enlightened poets like modern Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Jaishankar Prasad and modern Meera Mahadevi Varma of the era has expressed her views while clarifying the nature of the poem
 vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki maanav hriday anant rupatamak jagat ke naanaa roopon, vyapaaron main bhatakta rahata he, lekin jab maanav ahan kii bhaavana kaa parityag karke vishuddh anubhuti maatr rah jaataa he, tab vah mukt hriday ho jaataa he
 The word which the voice of man has been providing for the practice of this liberation of the heart is called poetry
 kavita manushya ko swaarth sambandhon ke sankuchit ghere se upar uthaati he or shesh sristi se ragaatmak sambandh jodne main sahaayak hoti he
 Numerous definitions of poetry are given
 ye paribhaashaayen aadhunik hindi kavy ke liye bhi sahi siddh hoti hai
 If poeticism makes the mind feel supernatural bliss, then the strings of the heart become tingling
 kavy main satyam shivan sundaram kii bhaavana bhi nihit hoti he
 The poetry in which all these things are found is considered to be good poetry
 kavy ke bhed do prakaar se kiye gaye hai– Depending on the form, there are two distinctions of poetry - audio and visual
 jis kavy kaa rasaswadan duusare se sunakar yaa swayan pard kar kiya jaataa he use shravy kavy kehete hai
 Such as Ramayana and Mahabharata
 shravy kavy ke bhi do bhed hote hai - prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy
 In this, a major story runs in the form of poetry from beginning to end
 katha kaa kram bich main kahin nahin tuutata or gaun kathaayen bich-bich main sahaayak ban kar aati hai
 Like Ramcharit Manas
 prabandh kavy ke do bhed hote hai - mahakavy evam khandakavy
 1- Epic In this, there is an autobiographical description of the entire life story of a historical or mythological great man
 mahakavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- 2- Khandakavya does not describe anyone's entire biography but only one part of life
 khand kavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- In this, only one verse or verse is able to reveal any emotion or rasa or story independently
 geet kavitt doha aadi muktak hote hai
 The poetry which Anandanubhuti realizes by seeing the act and listening to the narration from the characters is called visual poetry
 jaise naatak main yaa chalchitr main
 1- Verse poetry - In this, a story is described in poetry, like Gitanjali
 2- gadhy kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan gadhy main kiya jaataa he, jaise jaishankar kii kamayani 
 
 
 To compose poetry in prose, the poet gets freedom from the rules of verses
 3- champu kavy - isamen gadhy or padya donon kaa samavesh hota he
 Maithilisharan Gupta's 'yashodhara' is Champu poetry
 aadhunik hindi padya kaa itihaas lagbhag 800 saal purana he or iskaa prarambh terahavin shatabdi se samajha jaataa he
 Like every language, Hindi poetry was also chronological before
 yani kisi kahani ko lay ke saath chand main baandh kar alankaaron se sajaa kar prastut kiya jaataa tha
 All the ancient texts of Indian literature are written in poetry
 iskaa vishesh kaaran yah tha ki lay or chand ke kaaran kavita ko yaad kar lenaa aasaan tha
 At the time when printing was not invented and making many copies of documents was not easy, it was the best tool to remember important things at that time
 yahi kaaran he ki us samay sahitya ke saath saath raajnneeti, vigyaan or ayurveda ko bhi padya main hi likhaa gaya
 The oldest poems of India are in the Sanskrit language in the Rigveda which has a beautiful collection of verses written in praise of nature

 Part of a category on Sikhism khalsa sikh dharm ke vidhiwat dikshaprapt anuyaayiyon samuhik rup he
 The Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh ji in Anandpur Sahib on the day of Baisakhi on 1699
 is din unhone sarvapratham paanch pyaaron ko amritpan karvaa kar khalsa banaaya tathaa tatpashchaat un paanch pyaaron ke haathon se swayan bhi amritpan kiya
 Satguru Gobind Singh has honored Khalsa with the status of "kaal Purakh ki Army" in Khalsa glory
 talwaar or kesh to pehle hi sikhon ke paas the, guru gobind singh ne "khande bate kii pahul" tayar kar kacha, kadaa or kangha bhi diya
 On the same day, "singh" was put behind the name of Khalse
 shaareerik dekh main khalse kii bhinta najar aane lagi
 But the Khalsa did not give up self-knowledge, his propaganda continued and the sword also continued when needed
 sikh dharm ke upar anya dharmon or sarkari numaayindo ke waar lagaataar bad gaye the
 By giving false news to the government, staunch followers of Islam got Guru Arjun Dev ji sentenced to death
 jab guru arjuna dev, ko bahut dukh de kar shahid kar diya gaya to guru hargobind ji ne talwaar uthaa lee
 This sword was raised only for self-defense and for the betterment of the general public
 guru hargobind ji ke jivan main un par lagaataar 4 hamale hue or satguru hari raae par bhi ek hamalaa hua
 Guru Hari Krishna also tried to make emperor Aurangzeb his follower
 guru teg bahadur ko sarkaar ne maut ke ghat utaar diya, kyonki wo hindu brahminon ke dukhon ko dekh kar sarkaar se apil karne gaye the
 After that, the government clerics started considering the increasing propaganda of Gurmat and the huge number of followers as a threat to their religion and they united against it
 is bich guru gobind singh ne kuch baniyon kii rachana kii jis main islam ke khilaaf sakht tippaniyan thi
 In view of the above circumstances and the oppressive behavior of Aurangzeb and his nominees towards the non-muslim people, when Guru Gobind Singh decided to wage an armed struggle to protect the religion, he looked for the Sikhs who pursue the Gurmat ideology, help the miseries
 Do and do not back down in the sacrifice of your sacrifice when you need it
 jab koi dharm aage badhata he to uske bahut aam dikhta he ki uske anuyaayi bahut hai, zyaadaatar to dekha-dekhi ho jate hai, kuch shardha main ho jate hai, kuch apane khudgarji ke kaaran ho jate hai, asal anuyaayi to hote hi gine chune hai
 Evidence of this was found in Anandpur
 jab satgur gobind singh ne talwaar nikal kar kaha kii ""unhen ek sir chaiye"" | sab hakke bakke rah gaye | kuch to maukey se hi khisak gaye | kuch kehane lag pade guru pagal ho gaya he | kuch tamaasha dekhne aae the | kuch mata gujri ke paas bhaag gaye kii dekho tumharaa saputra kya khichdi pakaa rahaa he | Bhai Daya Singh ji was the first hand in the crowd of 10 thousand
 Behind the Gurmat ideology, he had the ability to behead
 Guru Sahib took him to the tent
 There was a goat neck cut
 Blood appeared to come out of the tent
 Fear increased in public
 Even then, by showing snow, Dharam Singh, Himmat Singh, Mohkam Singh, Sahib Singh accepted to cut their sis
 Guru Sahib kept goatting
 paanchon ko phir tamboo se bahar niklaa or khande bate kii pahul tayar kii | Khanda Bata is composed of Jantra mantras and tantras smelled
 isko pehali baar satgur gobind singh ne banaaya tha
 The water prepared by this method is called "pahul"
 aam bhashaa main ise log amrit bhi kehete hai
 By drinking this, the Sikh becomes a part of the Khalsa Army, that is, he has now surrendered his body and wealth to God, now he will only proclaim the truth and if the need arises, he will not back down from cutting his throat
 sab vikaron se dur rahegaa
 Such a Sikh is also called Amritdhari
 yah pahul paanchon ko pilaai gai or unhen paanch pyaaron ke kitaab se niwaja
 2 Kakkar was already in Sikhism
 jahaan sikh atmik satl par sab se bheen samaj rakhata tha satgur gobind singh ji ne un do kakaron ke saath saath kangha, kadaa or kacha de kar shaareerik dekh main bhi khalse ko bhinn kar diya
 Today, Khande Bate's Pahul prepares only five beloved
 yah prikriya aaj rivaaj ban gayi he
 Today the test is not taken as it was
 is prikriya ko amrit sanchaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 History is a witness to the fact that Guru Gobind Singh ji also used to run under five love and obeyed his orders
 paanch pyaaron ne gobind singh ko chamkor kaa kila chhodane kaa hukum diya or unhen maananaa padaa
 The five loves then interrupted Gobind Singh ji, while Gobind Singh was greeting Dadu's tomb to examine these
 gobind singh ne banda bahadur ko bhi paanch pyaaron ke sang bheja gaya, itihaas main zikr he ki jab banda bahadur pyaaron kii ulanghnaa karata rahaa to banda bahadur ko sab kile main chhod gaye

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam
 In later years, Muhammad underwent several social and religious reforms, uniting the various Arab tribes under Islam
 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness

 According to a custom, Allah’s Rasul has said that "I am the best speaking Arab, so i was born in Quraysh and grew up in Saad"

 The word pauses is derived from Vi + rm + h and its root meaning is "pause", "rest" etc
 jin sarvasammat chinhon dwaara, arth kii spashtataa ke liye vaakya ko bhinn bhinn bhaagon main baantate hai, vyakaran yaa rachanashastra main unhen "viraam" kehete hai
 The exact English synonym of "break" is "stop", but in use the word "punctuation" is found in this sense
 "panktuation" kaa sambandh latin shabd shabd se he, jiskaa arth "bindu" he
 Thus the true meaning of "punctuation" is "to point" or "to place a point in a sentence"
 praaia: log samajhate hai ki "viraam" shabd kaa is arth main prayog aadhunik he or yah shabd panktuation" kaa anuwaad he
 But essentially this is not the case
 panini se bhi bahut purv praatishakhyon evam shikshagranthon main viraam shabd kaa prayog isse milte julate arthon main miltaa he
 There are four types of breaks in Taittariya Pratyakshaya: arthath rugviram, padviram, vivritiviraam, samaanpadavivrittiviraam, in viraamon kii matraayen kramash: teen, do, ek tathaa ardh maani gai hai
 These include the end of the Rigviram phase or verses, ie the complete stop today
 "rik" kaa arth he chand, isiilie is viraam ko "rugviram" kaha gaya he
 It has often been a tradition to give one or two standing pies
 kabhi kabhi chota vriksh yaa phool bhi banaate rahe hai
 "pause" is the middle of two words or terms
 padon ke bich main aata he
 Being in the middle of the posts, it is named "padmaram"
 vastut: padon ke bich koi viraamchihn diya nahin jaataa
 It only means that in normal language there is a pause or lack of sound between the words and it should be about two volumes
 teesraa viraam "vivritiviraam" bhi shabdon yaa padon ke bich main hi aata he, kintu ye vishesh prakaar ke shabd yaa pad hote hai
 Sometimes in Sanskrit it happens that the vowel comes at the end of the word and the vowel at the beginning of the word after it
 saamanyat: aisi sthiti main sandhi ho jaati he
 But when there is no pact between them, the pause between these two words is only half the amount of pause between other common words or pauses
 yahi "vivritiviraam" he
 The breaks between "hari Etau," "ego Isha:" belong to this class
 "vivruti", swaron kii asandhi vivruti: swaryorasandhi: - taittiriya praatishakhth) kaa paribhaashik naam he
