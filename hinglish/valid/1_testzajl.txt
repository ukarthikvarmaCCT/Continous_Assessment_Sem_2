 In this way, the classification of animals and plants is used in classics or taxonomy in English, two terms for taxonomy - taxonomy and systematics
 karl liniyas ne 1735 i
 main sistemaa naturai naamak pustak systematics shabd ke aadhaar par likhi thi
 In the modern era both these terms are used for plant and animal classification
 vargiki kaa kaary aakaariki, akritivigyaan kriyavigyaan, paristhitiki or anuvanshiki par aadhaarit he
 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also an analysis of many types of knowledge, beliefs and systems, which are used in the field of classification
 jeevigyaan sambandhi kisi prakaar ke vishleshan kaa pratham sopan he suvyavasthit dhang se uskaa vargeekaran; at: padap, yaa jantu ke adhyayan kaa pehla kadam he uskaa namakaran, vargeekaran or tab varnan
 The basic formulation of taxonomy is based on morphology, morphology, ecology and genetics
 anya vaigyanik anushasano kii tarah yah bhi anek prakaar ke gyaan, mat or pranaaliyon kaa sanshleshan he, jiskaa prayog vargeekaran ke kshetra main hota he
 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 aajkal padap kii chaar lakh jatiyon se adhik jatiyaan gyaat hai
 These are sixty times greater than the time of Linnaeus
 prati varsh lagbhag 4,750 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 More than a million names have been given from 1763 to 1942 AD in plant groups called phenerogams and cryptougams, including synonyms and subcastes

 Apparently Aristotle has compiled the wisdom of his time appropriately
 aristotle ke ullekh main vargeekaran kaa prarambh dikhaai padataa he
 They are of the opinion that animals can be separated on the basis of their way of living, nature and physical size
 inhone pakshi, machhlee, hwel, keet aadi jantusamoohon kaa ullekh kiya he or chote samoohon ke liye colioptera or dyptera aadi shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya he
 The botanists of this time were ahead of Aristotle's ideology
 unhone sthaneey paudhon kaa safal vargeekaran kar rakhaa tha
 Brunfels and Bauhin were scientists on the successful path of plant taxonomy, but the experts of this time classifying animals were still working under Aristotle's ideology
 janvigyaan visheshgyon main jon re pratham vyakti the, jinhone jati or vansh main antar spasht kiya or pracheen vaigyanikon main ye pratham the, jinhone ucchtar prakritik vargeekaran kiya
 They had an impact on the great naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who lived in Sweden
 linius ne is disha main adwitiya kaary kiya
 Therefore, they are considered to be the father of classification science

 Animals from far away were studied and their offspring and family etc
 were studied

 According to Haxley, modern taxonomy is a synthesis of geography, ecology, extracellular and genetics etc

 In modern taxonomy, the description of castes is not solely based on natural traits, but is biological, due to which attention is also given to geographical, ecological, genetic and some other characteristics

 Linnaeus created five such categories: prayek shrenee main ek athwa ek se adhik neeche str ke samooh sammilit hote hai or ve nimna shrenee banaate hai
 Similarly each successive category belongs to one or more higher category
 ye shreniyan prakritik prabhed kam karke ek vyapak pranali bana detii hai
 With the development of knowledge, the number of these categories increased
 jagat or varg ke bich sangh or gana tathaa vansh ke bich main kutumb naamak shreniyan jodi gai
 According to Linnaeus, the species is an alternative category, which includes geographical or individual variation
 is tarah ab nimna saat shreniyan ho gai hai : For a more accurate interpretation of the classification, these categories are also divided into other categories
 adhiktar mul naam ke pehle adhi athwa up upsargon ko jodakar in shreniyon kaa namakaran kiya gaya he
 For example, precepts and subgroups etc
 unchi shreniyon ke liye kai naam prastaavit kiye gaye, parantu saamaanya prayog main ve nahin aate
 Only the primitive caste is used between the family and the clan
 kuch lekhakon ne, jaise simpasan, ne gana or varg ke bich sahagan naam kaa prayog kiya he
 In this way, the number of commonly used categories is presently as follows: vartmaan samay main 'anterrashtriya namakaran code' dwaara jeevon ke vargeekaran kii saat shreniyan paribhaashit kii gayi hai
 These categories are - Jagat, Sangha, class, Gana, clan, clan and caste
 In recent years, another level called domain has come into vogue which is placed above the 'world'
 kintu ise abhi tak kodon main sweekrut nahin kiya gaya he
 Categories can also be created between the seven main categories, for which prefixes 'adhi-', 'sub-' or 'infra-' should be used
 iske alaava jantuvigyaan tathaa vanaspati vigyaan ke vargeekaran kii shreniyon main maamuli antar bhi he )
 The following are the commonly used categories at this time: parjiviyon main vrahat bhinnata, jeev vaigyanikon ke liye unka varnan karnaa tathaa unhen namavali baddh karnaa ek badi chunauti upasthit karti he

 wo gaharwar rajvansh se the jise ab rathod rajvansh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Jayachandra was the son of Maharaja Vijayachandra
 ye kannauj ke raja the
 Jaichand's coronation took place on 1212 Aashaadh Shukla 6
 raja jayachand parakramee shaasha tha
 His large military corps always used to roam, so it is also called 'd-pangu'
 iskaa gungan prithviraj raso main bhi hua he
 Rajashekhar Suri has stated in his management book that Kashiraj Jayachandra was the conqueror and ganga-yamuna Doab was his specially occupied territory
 nayanchandra ne rambhamanjari main jayachand ko yawanon kaa naash karne vaala kaha he
 Being warlike, he increased his military power in such a way that it became unique, by which Jayachand came to be known as 'pangu'
 jab ye yuvaraj the tab hi apane parakram se kalinger ke chandel raja madan verma ko parrast kiya
 After becoming king, he won many
 jayachand ne sindhu nadi par musalamaanon se aisa ghor sangram kiya ki rakt ke pravaah se nadi kaa nil jal ekadam aisa laal hua maanon amavasya kii raatri main usha kaa arunoday ho gaya ho 
 Yavaneshwar Sahabuddin Gauri was defeated several times in the battle by Jayachandra
 rambhamanjari main bhi kaha gaya he ki jayachandra ne yawanon kaa naash kiya
 He had a large kingdom in North India
 usne anhilwara ke shaasha siddhraj ko haraaya tha
 It extended its state border from north to south along the banks of the Narmada
 purv main bengal ke lakshmanasen ke rajya ko chooti thi
 Prithviraj Chauhan was defeated by Gauri in the battle of Tarain
 iske parinaam swaroop dilli or ajmer par musalamaanon kaa aadhipaty ho gaya tha
 Gauri handed over the administration here to his chief commander Aibak and went to his own country
 tarain ke yuddh ke baad bharat main musalamaanon kaa sthaayee rajya bana
 Aibak became the representative of Gauri and started ruling from here
 is yuddh ke do varsh baad gauri dubaara vishaal sena lekar bharat ko jeetne ke liye aayaa
 This time he intended to win Kannauj
 kannauj us samay sampann rajya tha
 Gauri carried out this attack with the intention of securing his conquered territory in North India
 vah jaanata tha ki bina shaktishaalee kannauj rajya ko adheen kiye bharat main uski satta kaayam na rah sakegi
 Two years after the Battle of Tarain, Qutbuddin Aibak marched on Jaichand
 sultan shahabuddin raste main pachaas hajaar sena ke saath aa mila
 On receiving the information about the Muslim invasion, Jaichand also came to the battlefield with his army
 donon ke bich itawa ke paas ‘chandaavar naamak sthaan par muqabla hua
 In the war, King Jayachand sat on an elephant and started operating the army
 is yuddh main jayachand kii puri sena nahin thi
 There were armies in different areas, Jaichand had a small army at that time
 durbhaagya se jayachand ke ek tir laga, jisase unka praanant ho gaya, yuddh main gauri kii vijay hui
 This war took place on 1250 AD
 jayachand par deshadrohi kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 It is said that he called Gauri to India to attack Prithviraj and also gave him military support
 vastut: ye aarope niraadhaar hai
 There is no evidence to suggest that Jaichand assisted Gauri
 gauri ko bulaane vaale desh drohi to duusare hi the, jinke naam prithviraj raso main ankit hai
 The main feudal work of Prithviraj came in the Sanyogita episode
 in logon ne gupt rup se gauri ko samachar diya ki prithviraj ke pramukh samant ab nahin rahe, yahi mauka he
 Even then Gauri did not believe, she sent her messengers to Delhi in disguise of fakirs
 ye log inhen logon ke paas gupt rup se rahe the
 He went and informed Gauri, when Gauri attacked Prithviraj
 gauri ko bhed dene vaale the nityanand khatri, pratapsingh jain, madhobhatta tathaa dharmayan kysth jo tenwaron ke kavi or adhikari the 
 There is no mention of Jaichand anywhere in contemporary history that he helped Gauri
 yah sab aadhunik itihaas main kapol kalpit baaten hai
 Jaichand had no disharmony with Prithviraj
 sanyogita prakaran se jarur vah thodaa kupit hua tha
 At that time Prithviraj was saved only by the grace of Jayachand
 sanyogita haran ke samay jayachand ne apni sena ko ajna di thi ki inako gher liya jaae
 He kept pressing Prithviraj for five consecutive days
 prithviraj ke pramukhpramukh samant yuddh main kaam aa gaye the
 On the fifth day, the army encircled and hardened
 jayachand aage badha vah dekhtaa he ki prithviraj ke peeche ghode par sanyogita baithi he
 He considered that Sanyogita had chosen Prithviraj
 agar main ise maar detaa hoon to bada anarth hoga, beti vidhwaa ho jaaegi
 He ordered the army to break the cordon, then Prithviraj reached Delhi
 phir jayachand ne apane purohit dilli bheje, jahaan vidhi-vidhaan se prithviraj or sanyogita kaa vivaah sampann hua
 Jayachand was neutral in the war between Prithviraj and Gauri
 is yuddh main prithviraj ne usase sahaayta bhi nahin maangi thi
 The first war also did not ask for help
 agar prithviraj sahaayta maangata to jayachand sahaayta jarur kar saktaa tha
 If Jaichand and Gauri had friendship then why would Gauri attack Jaichand later? Therefore, this allegation is false
 prithviraj raso main yah baat kahin nahin kahi gai ki jayachand ne gauri ko bulaayaa tha
 Similarly, in contemporary Persian texts, there is not even an indication that Jaichand invited Gauri
 yah ek suni-sunai baat he jo ek rudhi ban gai he
 Jaichand and historian Historians are said to be abusive in the absence of sufficient knowledge of history for Emperor Jaichand while the opinion of eminent historians towards Emperor Jaichand is as follows
 is kathan main koi satyata nahin he ki maharaj jayachand ne prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye mohammad gauri ko aamantrit kiya ho
 - Dr
 RC Existent yah baat aadharahin he ki maharaj jayachand ne mohammadgauri ko prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 - J
C
 Powal jayachand par yah aarope galat he
 Contemporary Muslim historians are completely silent on the fact that Jaychand sent such an invitation
 - dow
 ramshankar treepathi The notion that Jayachand invited Muslims to ascend Prithviraj is unfounded
 us samay ke katipay granth prapya hai kintu kisi main bhi is baat kaa ullekh nahin he
 There is no such mention in the description of Prithviraj Vijay, Hamir epic, Rambha Manjari, Pramukh Kosh and any Muslim traveler
 itihaas is baat kaa sakshi he ki jayachand ne chandaavar main mohammad gauri se shaury purna yuddh kiya tha
 | - Mahendra Nath Mishra yah baat nitant asaty he ki jayachand ne shahbuddin ko prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Shahabdin was well aware that till the superpower Jaichand was defeated in North India, the authority over the territories of Delhi and Ajmer etc
 would not be permanent because Jaichand's ancestors and Jayachand himself had defeated the Turko many times
 - ebn naseer In the historical book titled Early History of India, it is not mentioned by the historian Smith
 yah vishwaas ki gauri ko jayachand ne prithviraj ke viruddh nimantran diya tha, thik nahin jaan padataa kyonki musalmaan lekhakon ne kahin bhi iskaa zikr nahin kiya he

 Rajbali Pandey vidhyaarthee vah vyakti hota he jo koi cheez sikh rahaa hota he

 vidhyaarthee kisi bhi ayuvarg kaa ho saktaa he balak, kishor, yuva, yaa vayask
 But the important thing is that he must be learning something

 Actually it was not so
 koi bhi rajvansh swechha se khatm nahin hua
 It was often the case that a new dynasty would start but it had little influence for a long time and fought the already established dynasty
 aisa bhi hota tha ke koi parajeet rajvansh haarane ke baavjood kuch ilaaqon main prabhutv rakhata tha or china kaa singhaasana waapas chhinane kii koshish main juta rahata tha

 nautanki uttar bharat, pakistan or nepal ke ek lok nrity or naatak style kaa naam he
 It is a descendant of the ancient Swang tradition in the Indian subcontinent and is named after a famous dance drama called 'shehzadi Nautanki', based on a princess named 'nautanki', a historical from Multan
 nautanki or swang main sabase bada antar yah mana jaataa he ki jahaan swang zyaadaatar dharmik vishyon se tallok rakhata he or use thodi gambhirtha se pradarshit kiya jaataa he vahaan nautanki ke mauzu prem or vir-ras par aadhaarit hote hai or unamem vyangy or tanz mishrit kiye jate hai
 Beginning in Punjab, the style of gimmick became increasingly popular and spread throughout North India
 samaaj ke ucch-darje ke log ise 'sasta' or 'ashleel' samajhate the lekin yah lok-kala panapati gai
 Most critics agree that 'nautanki is an evolved form of farce style'
 nautanki ki kathaayen aksar kisi vyakti par yaa mahatvapurn vishay par hoti hai, masalan aalha-oodal kii nautanki
 Similarly, 'sultana dacoit' gimmick tells the story of a dacoit in Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh of the same name
 bharat ke swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan us vishay par bahut si nautankiyaan huin thi jinhonen jan-saadhaaran ko is sangram main shaamil hone kii prerana di
 Nowadays, gimmicks can be seen against dowry-malpractices, terrorism and communal fighting
 darshakon kii ruchi banaae rakhane ke liye nautankiyon main aksar prem-sambandh ke bhi kuch tatv hote hai jinka prayog ashleelata ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, many obscene gimmicks have also been going on for one and a half years, due to which the style of gimmick is often discredited
 parmparik rup se nautankiyon main paisa banane ke liye yah zaruri tha ki darshakon ko kabhi bhi oobane na diya jaae, isliye adhiktar nautankiyon main 10 minute yaa us se kam avadhi kii ghatnaon ko ek silsile main jodakar banaaya jaataa he jisamen har bhaag main darshakon kii ruchi banaae rakhane kii koshish kii jaati he
 To keep the story interesting, heroism, love, fun, song-dancing and religion are mixed and the narrator tries to keep the audience's feelings up and down constantly
 nautanki main kavita or saadhaaran bolchaal ko milaane kii pratha shuru se rahi he
 The characters talk among themselves but deep feelings and messages are often revealed through rhyme
 gane main saarangi, table, hormonium or nagaade jaise vaadya istemaal hote hai
 For example, in a form of 'sultana dacoit', Sultana explains to his girlfriend that he is born to help the poor and therefore robs the rich
 uski premika kahati he ki use sultanaa kii veerta par naaz he : Please note that traditional hindi-urdu words are often used in Nautanki
 'kairaat' or 'khuda' jaise shabdon main bindu-vaale 'kh' kaa uccharan bindu-rahit 'kha' se zaraa alag he or 'karaab' or 'kareed' jaise shabdon se miltaa-julata he
 Similarly, in words like 'poor' and 'gum', the pronunciation of the dotted 'g' is slightly different from the pointless 'g' and is found in words like 'wrong' and 'missing'
 ashwamedh bharatvarsh kaa pracheenkaaleen ek prakhyat yajna kaa naam he

 Therefore, in addition to the universal God, the idol-worshiping king could perform Ashwamedha
 yah ati pracheen yajna prathit hota he kyonki rugveda ke do sookhton main ashvamedhiy ashv tathaa uske havan kaa vishesh vivaran diya gaya he
 It has a very detailed description available in the Shatapatha and Taittiriya Brahmins, which have been followed in the Svrut Sutras, Valmikya Ramayana, the Mahabharata in the month of gala and Jaiminiya Ashwamedha

 Avashmedha was a non-sacrificial Yag of three Sutya days
 "sutya" se abhipraay somalata ko kootakar somras chulane se tha 
 It consisted of twelve initiations, twelve subsets and three satyas
 21 aratni unche 21 yup prastut kiye jate the
 The second Sutadivas was predominant and particularly important
 us din ashvamedhiy ashv ko anya teen ghodon ke saath rath main jot kar talab main snaan karaayaa jaataa tha
 Brahmodya means to ask and understand esoteric riddles

 Ashwamedha is a symbolic 'yoga' with each part of it hidden
 aitarey brahman main ashwamedhayagi pracheen chakravarti nareshon kaa bada hi mahatvashaalee aitihaasik nirdesh he
 Even in the historical period, the Brahmin kings or the Vedic Dharmarunayayi kings constituted Ashwamedha with great enthusiasm
 raja dasharath tathaa yudhisthir ke ashwamedh pracheen kaal main sampann hue kahe jate hai
 Second century BC In the time of the Brahmin Renaissance, Shanvvanshi Brahmannaresh Pushyayamitra performed Ashwamedha twice, in which Mahabhashikar Patanjali himself was present
 gupt samrat samudragupta ne bhi chauthi sadi i

 The Chalukya and Yadav kings of the south also continued this tradition

 dattatreya upanishad atharvavedic shakha ke antargat ek upanishad he
 This Upanishad is written in Sanskrit language
 iske rachiyata vaidic kaal ke rishiyon ko mana jaataa he parantu mukhyat vedavyas ji ko kai upanishdon kaa lekhak mana jaataa he
 There is no opinion of scholars regarding the creation of Upanishads
 kuch upanishdon ko vedon kii mul samhitaon kaa ansh mana gaya he
 They are the most ancient
 kuch upanishad ‘brahman’ or ‘aaranyak’ granthon ke ansh maane gayi hai
 His creation is later than the codes
 upanishdon ke kaal ke vishay me nishchit mat nahi he samaanyat upanishdo kaa kaal rachanakaal 3000 isa purv se 500 isa purv mana gaya he
 The following main facts have been considered as the basis for the decision of the Upanishads- nimna vidwaanon dwaara vibhinn upanishdon kaa rachana kaal nimna kram main mana gaya he- The flying Spaghetti demon is the god of Pastafari religion
 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai

 In the modern era, due to the increase and change in the means of war and the skills of the fort, the importance of the forts has ended and there is no need for them
 vedikkaleen sahitya main puron kaa jis rup main ullekh he usase gyaat hota he ki un dinon durg se ghiri bastiyaan hua karti thim
 Durg is also mentioned in the Rigveda

 Manu has written six types of fortifications - mahabharat main yudhisthir ne jab bhishma se poocha he ki raja ko kaise poor main rahanaa chahie tab bhishma ji ne ye hi chah prakaar ke durg ginaae hai or kaha he ki poor aise hi durgon ke bich main hona chahie
 In both Manusmriti and Mahabharata, it is said to be necessary for the corpus, army, weapons, craftsmen, Brahmins, vehicles, trins, reservoir grains, etc
 to remain inside the fort
 agnipurana, kalkipurana aadi main bhi durgon ke uparyukt chah bhed batalaaye gaye hai
 From the archaeological excavations, the remnants of archaeological cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Roopad etc
 have come to light that in those days there were two sections of the cities; a section was surrounded by tall ramparts
 aitihaasik kaal ke kile ke pracheenatam avshesh rajgrih main pattharon se bane pracheer ke rup main praapt hue hai
 From the few signs found in the fort of Pataliputra, it seems that wood was used in the construction of the ramparts
 mauryaal main megasthnij naamak jo yavan rajdoot aayaa tha usne is kile kaa vishad varnan kiya hai
 He wrote that the city of Pataliputra is nine miles long and about two miles wide, surrounded by a bough of around 600 cubits and 30 cubits deep

 But the full form of these most ancient forts is not revealed
 eran main, jo gupt kaal main ek prasiddh nagar tha, kaaphi dur tak durg ke avshesh mili hai
 It is known from his study that the city was settled in such a way that the rivers serve as a trench
 teen ore se vah veena nadi se ghira hua tha, chauthi ore do anya choti nadiyaan thim, jo nagar ke pashchimi bhaag main bahati thim or chauthi ore veena nadi main girti thim
 Within this natural moat created by the rivers was the rampart of the fort which was probably made of very steep walls and there would have been high round bastions
 kautilya ke arthshaastra ke anusaar chote kilon ko sangrahan, unase bade ko dronmukh or sabase bade kilon ke do rup bataae gaye hai- The following 8 types of fortifications have been described in Someshwarcharit Manasollas - samrajyalakshmipithika main nau prakaar ke durgon kii visheshtaayen diye gayi hai

 sabase unchi chaharadivari ke bheetar mukhya durg hota tha
 Often both the city and the main fort were in the periphery of the forts
 mukhya durg ke ek ore unchi pahari yaa nadi kaa kinaaraa hota tha
 While constructing the fort, special attention was paid to protect the routes through which enemies could come into the fort or attack
 saamaanya rup se kile ke nirmaan ke liye kisi unchi pahari ko chunaa jaataa tha jisaki dhaalu chattaanon par pahunchnaa kathin hota tha
 On the side from which the enemy was expected to climb, the rocks on that side were cut and made a sloping path, which would protect it by one wall and the other hill was absolutely straight and steep
 kahin-kahin in dhalwaan margon main chaar se lekar saat tak drudh dwaar bane hote the
 The outer walls of the forts were built on flat land, which was guarded by trenches protecting the broad and deep walls
 yadi kila nadi ke kinare sthit hota to ek ore se nadi uske raksha karti thim or shesh or khaaiyaan
 The trenches were crossed by the lift bridge, as in the Agra Fort

 daravaaje ke ek pat par ek khidki bhi laga di jaati thim jo aakaar main 3 foot chaudee tathaa 4 foot unchi hoti thim
 In this window also, pointed beams were used

 The tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is being used primarily in public health programs
 tibi ke upachaar main antibiotic dawaaon kaa upyog karke bacteria ko maaraa jaataa he
 Effective TB treatment is difficult due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacteria cell wall, which inhibits the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective
 do sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali antibiotic dawaayein isoniyazid or riffampisin hai or upachaar, lambey samay kaa ho saktaa he jisame kai mahine lag sakate hai
 An antibiotic is commonly used in the treatment of latent TB, while a combination of several antibiotics is used in active TB disease to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance
