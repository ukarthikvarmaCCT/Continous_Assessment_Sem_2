 Bhaskaracharya discusses permutations in Lilavati's chapter titled 'akpash' At number of places which are filled with equal nymbers of digits, place 1, 2, 3, 4 


 in increasing order
 The product of these digits is the required number of permutations
 Similarly, In the given digits, if some digits are repeated, then at those number of places find number of permutations assuming different digits
 Divide by this number, the number of permutations of all given digits, assuming different digits at all places
 Similarly, Mahaviracharya has given the following formula for the total accumulation of some given items in the Mathematics collection
 in order below; the product in the reverse order is divided by the product in order; is the result
 It is noteworthy that several centuries later, in 1634 AD, exactly the same formula was given by Herrigon

 In the second half of the twentieth century, the study of permutation gained momentum and dozens of journals of this subject came into existence and many seminars were held on this subject

 tannenbom - trowalds vaarta andru tannenbom or linas trowalds ke bich ek bahes thi
 This debate was about Linux and kernel architecture
 tatnenbom ne is bahes kii shruwaat 1992 main Usenet ke discshan group comp
os
minix main shuru kiya tha
 He argued that microcernals are better than monolithic kernels, so Linux was also OBSOLIT at that time
 duusare jane mane haikar jinhone is bahes main bhaag liya vah the david es miller or theodor tso 
 At first in this debate only minor things were being discussed about Colonel Design
 lekin bahes ke aage badhate hi zyada vistrut or jatil baaten hone lagi
 Along with kernel design, this debate also went on to other topics, such as which microprocessor architecture will be ahead of others in the future, etc
 tannenbom or trowalds ke saath kai or log is vaarta main jude iname peter mcdonald or david es miller or theodor tso jo kii ek uttar amareeki linaks karnal develper the
 The debate was first recorded on January 29, 1992, when Tannenbom made a post in comp
minix
os criticizing the Linux kernel
 isamen unhone likhaa tha kii kaise linaks karnal kaa monolithik hona uski kshamtao ko haani pahunchaata hai
 The title of this post was titled Linux is Obsolite
 bahes ke shruwaat main takaniki baarikiyon main na jate hue unhone itnaa kaha kii unhen lagata hai ki microkarnal dizine monolithik karnal se behatar hai
 He cited the reason for portability, and also said that Linux kernels are much more connected to x86 processors
 unhen x86 processors kaa bhavishya ujjwal nahin lagata tha
 To add to his argument, he went on to say that writing the monolithic colonel in 1991 "is a big step backwards - towards the 1970s"
 yah aalochana ek public newsgrup main post kii gayi thi isliye linas iskaa sidhaa jawaab de sakate the
 This is what Linus did the next day, with Linus arguing that minix's design had some imperfections, so Tannenbom should not object to his efforts
 iske baad linas ne yah bataaya unhone kaise linaks Intel 80386 procesar ke liye khaas rup se banaaya hai or yah trowalds ke abhayas kaa bhi ek hissaa tha
 Trovalds stated that doing so made Linux kernels less portable than MINIX
 linas ne yah daawa kiya kii yah sweekaarya dizine siddhant hai kyunki isse aplicoshan programing interfes zyaada saral or portable ban jaataa hai
 That's why Trovalds also said that "linux is more portable than Minix"
 linas ke is uttar ke baad, tannenbom ne yah tark diya kii professor hone ke naate unhen MINIX main kuch simaaye rakhni padi
 MINIX had to build them according to the hardware available with a simplified student, which was a computer with the INTEL 8088 processor at the time
 in computers main kabhi kabhi to hard drive bhi nahin hota tha
 At that time Linux was created specifically for computers with INTEL 80386 processors
 yah procesar zyaada shaktishaalee tha
 Tannenbom also wrote "until a year ago there were two versions of Minix one for PC and one for INTEL 286 / 386 processors
 PC varshan 286 / 386 varshan se dugana bik rahaa tha "
 Tannenbom also wrote that Linux was free software, but most students would not be able to use it because they would not be able to buy more expensive hardware to use it and Minix "used on machines without a hard drive with a regular 4
77 mhz processor
 Can be done "
 is par USENET ke ek or yujar kevin brown ne tannenbom ko jawaab diya kii linaks kaa 386 architekchar se judaa hona dizineras kii pasand thi oparating system kaa gyaan na hona nahin
 He wrote "one of the goals of Linux's design was to exploit the features of the 386 processor
 to aap kya kahana chaahate hai ? alag alag dizine gols aapako alag alag dizine degaa "
 Brown also said that creating a unique system design for cheap hardware makes portability of that system difficult in the future
 haalanki minix nae hardware ko saport nahin karti thi phir bhi tannenbom ne yah tark diya kii x86 architekchar ko bhavishya main duusare architekchar peeche chhod denge isliye unhen is bare main kuch karne kii zaroorat nahin hai
 Tannenbom said "after 5 years the situation will be different
 Everyone will be using the free GNU operating system on their 200 MIPS, 64 sparcstation 5
 naseehat 1986 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 In law, the final fact is the conclusion of evidence made by a jury after factual deliberation
 ek aam paribhaasha he, "ek pareekshan main, is tathy kaa ek nishkarsh he jo taarkik saboot se parinaam nikaalnaa jaataa he"
 This "conclusion was reached during the hearing on the basis of fine facts

 French-born Louis Braille became an eye of wisdom for the blind

 Louis Braille was born on 4 January 1809 in the small village of Cupre, France, into a middle-class family
 inke pita simon rele braille shahi ghodon ke liye lathi or jin banane kaa kaary kiya karte thea
 Simon did not have to work extra due to not having enough financial resources to suit the family's needs, so when the boy Louis was only three years old, his father also took him along with him to make saddles and genes for horses
 apane swabhaav ke anuroop teen varshiya balak apane aas paas uplabdh vastuon se khilne main apana samay bitaayaa karata tha isaliye balak louis ke khilne kii vastuye vahi thim jo uske pita dwaara apane kaary main upyog kii jaati thim jaise kathor lakdi, rassi, lohe ke tukde, ghode kii naal, chaaku or kaam aane vaale lohe ke aujaar
 It was also natural for a three-year-old boy to play with the things available near him and to indulge in mischief
 ek din lathi ke liye lakdi ko katate main istemaal kiya jane vaali chaaku achaanak uchhal kar is nanhen balak kii aankh main ja lagi or balak kii aankh se khun kii dhara bah nikali
 The weeping boy came straight home with his hand pressed and his eyes were blindfolded with simple roots
 shaayad yah mana gaya hoga ki chota balak he se sheeghra hi chot swatah thik ho jaayegi
 The boy began to wait for Louis's eye to recover
 kuch din baad balak louis ne apni duusari aankh se bhi kam dikhalaayi dene kii shikaayat kii parantu yah uske pita simon kii saghan hinata rahi hogi athwa laaparvaahee jiske chalate balak kii aankh kaa samuchit ilaaj nahin karaayaa ja sakaa or dhire dhire vah nanha balak aath varsh kaa puraa hone tak puri tarah drushti hin ho gaya
 Everything for that child was drowned in deep darkness in place of a colorful world

 The accident happened in Louis's father's workshop

 It was the year 1821
 balak louis ab tak baarah barsh kaa ho chukaa tha
 At the same time, Louis Luis, a child in the school, learned that retired Captain of the Royal Army Charles Barber had developed a script for the army with the help of which he could frantically read messages even in the dark
 capten charlas barbar kaa uddeshy yudv ke dauraan sainikon ko aane vaali pareshaaniyon ko kam karnaa tha
 The brain of the child Louis was looking for the possibility of studying for visually impaired people in a crypt which could be read by soldiers

 The pastor arranged for Louis to meet the captain
 apni mulaakaat ke dauraan balak ne capten ke dwaara suzaayi gayi kutalipi main kuch sanshodhan prastaavit kiye
 Captain Charles Barber was stunned by the self-confidence of the blind boy
 antat padri belantin ke is shishy ke dwaara bataaye gayi sanshodhano ko unhone sweekaar kiya
 Over the years, Louis Braille himself made several amendments to the script with eight years of tireless work and finally in 1829 succeeded in making such a script based on six points
 louis braille ke aatmavishvash kii abhi or pariksha hona baaki tha isaliye unke dwaara avishkrut lipi ko tatkaaleen shikshashashtriyon dwaara manyata nahin di gayi or uskaa makhul udaaya gaya
 The name of retired army captain Charles Barber constantly hinged on this script and being used by the military, this script was considered as the army's script, but Louis Braille did not give up and Pastor Ballantine's sensitive economic and mental With the help of this disciple, his undisclosed script was continuously promoted among the visually impaired
 unhone sarkaar se prarthana kii ki ise drushthihinon kii bhashaa ke rup main manyata pradaan kii jaay
 It was a misfortune for Luis that his efforts could not succeed and it was not considered recognizable as a language by the then educationists

 After the incident of Louis's death, academics began to understand the seriousness of their work and in the direction of giving recognition to the script, getting out of their prejudiced orthodox ideas about the script, which is constantly being recognized among the visually impaired
 antat louis kii mrityu ke puure ek sau varshon ke baad france main 20 june 1952 kaa din unke sammaan kaa diwas nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 On this day, the remains of his body buried in his planet village Cupre hundred years ago were taken out with full state honors

 The measurement appears to be only 46 feet, as the rest of the pressure velocity changes to pressure
 barnuli ke tathy se bahut si samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 There are many other things to be diagnosed in the flow of water, such as the distribution of water from small to large exits, the reduction of the flow of the drainage due to the narrowing of the drainage, the design of the drainage and its shape on the drainage
 , The formation of small big whirlpools in the road to Nikasa, all these things are attached to the canals, or to the means made for water distribution in the water-distribution centers

 In fact, many such things are coordinated in water engineering, which is not possible to solve through mathematics
 at: bahut si samasyaon kaa samaadhaan chote praturup arthath chote aakaar ke namoonay banaakar kiya jaataa he
 By entering water into these samples or models and measuring their speed, it is determined what effect the practical flow of water will have on the works made from different designs

 a lot of pressure is lost by friction in the flow of water
 isi kaaran bahudhaa unche yaa duuri par sthit sthalon par jalapradaay sadhano main pani anukool dabaav se nahin nikal paata
 However, in open canals, there is also a loss of pressure by friction
 jal ejiniyari dwaara is prakaar bahut se saadhan prastut kiye jate hai ki dabaav kaa kshay kam se kam ho
 Therefore, means of paving or lubricating the waterways are used

 For this also, by the principles of water engineering, such means are collected, through which either the plantation is stopped at all, or the water flows by the surrender at such a speed, so that the particles of the land are not removed
 yadi bhoomi ke kan hatane lagate hai to parinaam yah hota he ki abhikalp par aadhaarit kaary ke andar pole hoti rahati he or kaary kii sthirataa jokhim main pad jaati he

 Samvat, Indian criterion of time reckoning
 bhartiya samaaj main anek prachlit sanwat hai
 There are mainly two Samvats, the first Vikram Samvat and the second Shak Samvat
 vikram sanwat i
 pus
 58 varsh prarambh hua
 It became popular as a commemoration of the defeat of Saka people, considered foreign at that time, by the collective efforts of Samvat Malavgan under the leadership of Vikram, the son of Gaddabhilla
 jaan padataa he, bhartiya janata ke deshprem or videshiyon ke prati unki bhaavana sadaa jaagrit rakhane ke liye janata ne sadaa se iskaa prayog kiya he kyonki bhartiya samraaton ne apane hi sanwat kaa prayog kiya he
 It is so certain that it was popularized by the Samvat Malavagans according to the sentiments of the people and has been accepted and used by the public since then
 is sanwat ke praarambhik kaal main yah kritasamvat, tadnantar malvasanwat or ant main 'vikram sanwat' rah gaya
 This last name is associated with this era
 shaq sanwat ke vishay main budua kaa mat he ki ise ujjayini ke kshatrap cheshton ne prachlit kiya
 Chandragupta Vikramaditya abolished the Saka states, but his memorial Saka Samvat is still going on in India
 shaq sanwat 78 i
 main prarambh hua
 Vikram Samvat BC Started 57 years
 yah sanwat maalav gana ke samuhik prayatnon dwaara gardbhill ke putr vikram ke netritv main us samay videshi maane janevaale shaq logon kii paraajay ke smarak rup main prachlit hua
 It seems, the public has always used it to keep the patriotism of the Indian public and their feelings towards foreigners, because the Indian emperors have used their own culture
 itnaa nishchit he ki yah sanwat maalav gana dwaara janata kii bhaavana ke anuroop prachlit hua or tabhi se janata dwaara grahya evam prayukt he
 In the early period of this Samvat, it became Krit, later Malava and finally Vikram Samvat
 yahi antim naam is sanwat ke saath judaa hua he
 Rashtriya Shake or Saka Samvat is the national calendar of India
 yah 78 varsh isa purv prarambh hua tha
 Chaitra 1, 1879 Saka Samvat was duly adopted by it
 500 i
 ke uparant sanskrit main likhit sabhi jyotishastreey granth shaq samvath kaa prayog karne lage
 There is a different view of why this era got its name
 ise kushaan raja kanishka ne chalaaya yaa kisi anya ne, is vishay main antim rup se kuch nahin kaha ja sakaa he
 This is a difficult problem which is considered in the very difficult problems of Indian history and time decisions
 varahamihir ne ise shaq-kaal tathaa shaq-bhupakaal kaha he
 Utpal has said in the interpretation of Brihatsamhita - When the king of Saka was killed by Vikramaditya, this era lasted
 iske varsh chandra-saura-gananaa ke liye caitra se evam saura gananaa ke liye mesh se armbh hote the
 Its years are generally passed and it was started from the 'vasanti equinox' of the year 78 AD
 sabase pracheen shilaalekh, jisamen spasht rup se shaq samvath kaa ullekh he, 'chalukya vallabheshwar' kaa he, jisaki tithi 465 shaq samvath arthath 543 i
 he
 The number of years is expressed in the inscriptions of Kshatrapa kings, but the name of Samvat is not, but those numbers are indicative of Saka period, it is generally the opinion of the people
 kuch logon ne kushaan raja kanishka ko shaq samvath kaa pratishthapak mana he
 In the later, intermediate and present times, the same thing is in Jyotirvidabharana, the name of Shak Samvat is 'shalivahana'
 kintu samvath ke rup main shalivahan rup 13veen yaa 14veen shatee ke shilalekhon main aayaa he
 It is possible that the name Satavahana became 'shalavahana' and came to be 'shalivahana'
 kashmir main prayukt saptarshi samvath ek anya samvath he, jo loukik samvath ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 According to Rajatarangini, the temporal year 24 is equivalent to the last Saka Samvat 1070
 is samvath ke upyog main saamanytah shatabdiyaan nahin di hui hai
 This is the lunar-solar era and the Pratipada of Chaitra Shukla was written in BC
 Started in April 3076
 brihatsamhita ne ek parampara kaa ullekh kiya he ki saptarshi ek nakshatra main sau varshon tak rahete hai or jab yudhishthar rajya kar rahe the to ve mesh raashi main the
 Probably this is the origin of circles of hundred years
 bahut-se anya sanwat bhi the, jaise - vardhaman, buddha-nirvana, gupt, chedi, harsh, lakshmanasen bengal main, kollam yaa parashuram malawar main, jo kisi samay kam se kam loukik jivan main bahut prachlit the
 Humanistic psychology is a psychological approach that became famous in the mid-20th century
 yah siddhanth sigmund froid ke manovishleshan siddhanth tathaa bi epa skinner ke vyavahaarwad ke jawaab main saamne aayaa
 Many theories have been proposed by psychologists to study personality
 beesvin shatabdi main vyaktitv adhyayan sambandhi vichaar, teen mahatvapurn siddhanton ke rup main saamne aaye
 Humanitarian theory has been interpreted in a very different way from other theories
 is siddhanth main vishesh rup se yah mana jaataa he ki vyakti mul rup main acha evam aadarneey hota he or yadi uski pariveshiy dashaaen anukool hon to vah apane shilgunon kaa sakaaratmak vikaas karata he
 This theory explains personal development, self-refinement, growth, values and meanings of a person
 is siddhanth ke pratipadak abraham maslo the
 Maslow was born in New York to a conservative Javis family
 unhone columbia vishvavidhyalay se san 1934 main manovigyaan viddya main piech

 Existential psychology has also contributed to the development of this theory called 'humanistic Psychology'

 In Maslow's theory, there is a belief that motivations affect humans as a whole
 isi dharna ke aadhaar par maslo ne prerana ke padanukram siddhanth ko pratipaadit kiya
 Psychologists of humanistic theory have considered the relative difference between human behavior and animal behavior
 ye vyavahaarwad kaa isliye khandan karte hai ki vyavahaarwad kaa prarambh hi pashu vyavhaar se hota he
 Maslow and his colleagues considered human behavior different from all kinds of animal behavior
 isliye unhone pashu vyavhaar kii maanav vyavhaar ke saath kii samanta ko asweekaar kiya
 He refuted the research work done on animals to understand human behavior because animals do not have human qualities like ideal, values, love, shame, art, enthusiasm, crying, laughing, jealousy, respect and equality
 in gunon kaa vikaas pashuon main nahin hota or vishesh mastishkeey kaary jaise kavita, geet, kala, ganit aadi kaary nahin kar sakate
 Humanists emphasized the intimate nature of humans in their interpretation of human behavior
 unke anusaar vyakti kaa ek antarang rup he jo kuch maatra main uske liye swaabhaavik, sthai tathaa aparivartanil he
 In addition, they have considered the creative actions of human beings as individual actions

 Maslow believed that it is useless to study a person's mental impairments without studying mental health
 maslo ne kaha ki keval asaamaanya, avikasiton, viklangon tathaa aswasthon kaa adhyayan karnaa keval ‘viklang’ manovigyaan ko janm dena he
 He laid greater emphasis on the study of psychologically healthy and self-actualized individuals

 raikhik bijganit main gouse kii vilopan vidhi raikhik samikarnon ke nikaay ko hal karne kii ek vidhi he jiske antargat kram se kuch sankriyaayein karne par antatah ek ko chhodkar baaki sabhi char vilupt ho jate hai
 In addition to solving a body of linear equations, Gauss's deletion method is used to derive the rank of a matrix, to derive the determinant of a matrix, and to derive the inverse of a square matrix
 is vidhi kaa naam germany ke ganitagya karl fredrick gouse ke naam par padaa he, yadhyapi yah vidhi unase pehle bhi gyaat thi
 Gauss's deletion method can be understood as the operations of the sequence on a matrix of related equations
 arthath samikarnon ko unke charon sahit lekar chalane kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati balki charon ko chhodane ke baad jo matrix bachati he, usee par sari sankriyaayein ek kram se kerani hoti hai
 In this deletion method only simple operations of the rows are performed so that the original matrix is converted into a matrix that has as many components of the left bottom corner as zero
 iske liye teen prakaar kii pankti-sankriyaayein kii jaatin hai- Properly performing these three operations, any matrix can be transformed into an upper triangular matrix that will actually be in the 'row-ellipse' format
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnlikhit pankti-sankriyaayein karte hue teesri or chauthi matrix pankti-sopanak ke rup main aa gayi hai tathaa antim matrix anany laghukrit pankti-sopanak swaroop main he
 The process of converting a matrix into an elongated row-ellipse by performing row operations is sometimes called gauss-jordan deletion
 kuch lekhak matrix ko upree tikoni matrix main badalane tak kii prakriya ko 'gouse vilopan' kehete hai
 When solving a body of linear equations, it is sometimes more convenient to stop row-operations before the matrix is fully minimized
 mana ki nimnlikhit samikarnon ke nikaay kaa hal nikaalnaa he
 The following table shows the entire process, showing three things: dhyaan rakhen ki praayah puure samikarnon ko badalte hue nahin dikhaaya jaataa he balki keval sanvardhit avyuuh or uske parivartit roopon ko hi lekar chalate hai
 The same is convenient for computers
 { \ displaystyle \ left} The body of equations changes in triangular form as y is eliminated from the third line
 is kalanvidhi kaa pehla bhaag yaheen samaapt hua
 From the calculation point of view, if the values of the variables are in the reverse order, the work is done quickly
 ise pasch-pratisthaapan kehete hai
 The solution is the following: arthath die gaye samikarnon ke nikaay kaa anany hal he
 The process can be continued only after the matrix has come to the row-ellipse form, and non-stop until the matrix is converted to the truncated row-ellipse
 
 The process from start to finish is sometimes called gauss-jordan deletion

 Both his brothers Francis Cunningham and Joseph Cunningham were also famous in British India for their contributions

 He was awarded the Order of Star of India on 20 May 1870 for his contributions
 baad main 1878 main inhen order of indian empire se bhi sammanit kiya gaya
 In 1887, he was declared Knight Commander of Indian Empire
 janm england main san 1814 i main hua tha
 He had a great interest in Indian history since the beginning of his service, and he had helped James Prinsep, a renowned researcher of Indian lore, to read articles of ancient coins and Kharoshthi script
 major kitto ko bhi, jo pracheen bhartiya sthanon kii khoj kaa kaam sarkaar kii ore se kar rahe the, inhone apana moolyavaan sahyog diya
 In 1872, Cunningham was appointed Surveyor of Indian Archeology and a few years later, he was appointed as Director General of the Archaeological Survey Department
 is pad par ve 1885 tak rahe
 While holding high positions in the Department of Archeology, Cunningham kept a lot of information about the ancient forgotten history of India in front of the world
 pracheen sthanon kii khoj or abhilekhon evam sikkon ke sangrahan dwaara unhone bhartiya ateet ke itihaas kii shodh ke liye moolyavaan saamagree jutai or vidwaanon ke lae is disha main kaary karne kaa maarg prashast kar diya
 The details of this important and diligent work of Cunningham were published in the form of archaeological reports, in 23 volumes, whose usefulness today is almost a century later
 kaningham ne pracheen bharat main aanevaale unani or chini paryatakon ke bharatvishyak varnanon kaa anuwaad tathaa sampadan bhi badi vidwata tathaa kushalta se kiya he
 His supplication of the tourist journey of the Chinese traveler Yuwanchwang, especially the identification of ancient places, is still considered very authentic
 1871 i
main unhone 'bharat kaa pracheen bhugol' naamak prasiddh pustak likhi jiskaa mahatv aaj tak kam nahin hua he
 The knowledge of ancient places that he had identified in this thesis proved to be correct in most, though many of his contemporaries and subsequent scholars raised many doubts about it

 But for years, scholars had differed with Cunningham on this subject, and in the end, when the Cunningham opinion came out in the present tense, then all the scholars had to admire his unique understanding

 heart ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki yojana ke khaarij hone se purv donon ke promotional photo bhi liye gaye the jinamein donon ko belt se tag of waar khelte dikhaaya gaya tha
 Instead, Hogan dropped the belt on Yokozuna in the final WWF round at the King of the Ring PPV
 Hogan did not respect him appropriately for the belt, and raised Brett as the leader of the "new WWF Generation"
 isi samay brett heart kaa apane chote bhai oven heart ke saath jhagada hua
 The story involved Owen being jealous of Brett
 isaki shuruyaat cerviver series ke dauraan hui thi jab yah chaaron heart bhai shaun mikels tathaa unke nits kaa muqabla kar rahe the

 Brett, along with his parents, tried to unite the family and end the fight during the Christmas holidays
 janvari ke royal rambal main brett tathaa oven ne dablyu dablyu epa tag team championships ke liye quebesars kaa muqabla kiya
 Referee Tim White stopped the match after learning that Brett had a knee injury during the match

 pratidwandvita royal rambal par jari rahi jab heart ne austin ko uthaakar ring se baahar phenk diya, austin ko bas waapas ring main aana tha or rambal jeet lenaa tha
 In order to settle the dispute, a fatal-fourway was organized between Austin and his contestant whom he had won by re-entering the ring In Your House 13: Final Four in which the winner would become the No
 1 contestant
 However, the match went to the WWF Championship after current champion Sean Michaels relinquished the belt
 heart ne austin, vaidar tathaa da andertekar ko fattl four-ve main haraa diya
