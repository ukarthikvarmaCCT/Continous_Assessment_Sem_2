 There is a book in Harshacharita Sanskrit composed by Banabhatta
 isamen bhartiya samraat harshavardhan kaa jeevancharit varnit he
 It is the oldest Sanskrit book related to historical plot
 is samay uplabdh harshcharit aath uchhvaason main vibhajit he
 The first two and a half sighs are in the form of Baan's autobiography
 taduparant sthanishwar ke punyabhuti vansh, jinamein harsh ke pita prabhakarvardhan kaa janm hua tha, kaa varnan he
 Baan has described the marriage of Prabhakarvardhan's daughter Rajyashree and Kannaujadhipati Grahavarma Maukhari
 apane jyeshtha putr rajvardhan ko hunon kaa hanan karne ke liye bhejkar prabhakarvardhan jvergrast ho gaye
 Baan has described his illness, death, cremation and self-immolation of the Empress Yashomati
 tabhi goud evam maalav senaaon ke kannauj par akraman tathaa grahaverma kii hatya kii soochna milti he yah sunakar rajyavardhan kannauj kii ore bade
 The enemies laid down their arms
 parantu chaalaaki kheli
 Rajyavardhan was invited to the enemy camp and brutally murdered
 harsh ne apane bahanoi evam bhai kii hatya kaa badla lene kii pratigya kii tathaa kannauj kii ore prasthaan kiya
 The enemy fled in front of Harsha's growing army
 yah sunakar harsh ke vismay kaa ant na tha ki rajyashri kaid se chhootakar vindhyachal kii ore chali gai
 After much diligent search, Harsha, eager to commit self-immolation, found Rajyashree near the ashram of friend Rishi and brought him to his camp on the banks of the Ganges
 yahan granth aksmaat samaapt ho jaataa he
 It is said that Baan's idea was not to completely write the character of Harsha
 vah iskaa keval maatr eiansh likhnaa chaahate the kyonki unhone apane shrotaaon ko batalaaya he ‘harsh ke jivan kaa varnan’ saikadon jiwanon main bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If you want to hear a part of it, then i am ready
 yah bhi thik hi kaha jaataa he ki ‘harshcharit’ harsh ke jivan kii keval ek ghatana maatr he kyonki harsh charit se uplabdh aitihaasik gyaan bahut hi kam he
 But while criticizing this book, we should not see it as a historical work
 vastutah use aitihaasik kathanak se yukt ek kavy kahana hi adhik yuktisangat he
 The author's full power is focused on showcasing poetic talent and historicity is secondary to him
 unhone kriti ke pratinayak bhoot goud evam maalav raajaaon kaa naam bhi nahin diya he
 Even after the determination to make the land void of the Gaudas, Baan has left the future events of the Gaudas
 jahaan pathak vindhyaparvat main se harsh kii gaveshna ke parinaam ko sunne ko utkanthit hai vahaan baan vindhyaparvat kaa sookshm varnan karne main sanlagn hai
 Astu, Baan have presented a beautiful picture of Harsha's departing army, Rajya Sabha, religious sects, villages, which is very important from the point of view of history

 Mandalji's elder brother Raja Bisaldevji sends him to Mewar to buy horses
 mewar pahunch kar raja mandal chouhan gurjar kuch ghode kharidte hai, magar bahut sara paisa wo talab banavaane main kharch kar dete hai or apane bhai se or paise mangavate hai jo wo bhejte rahete hai
 Bisaldevji comes to find out what Mandalji is doing for so many money
 is baat kaa pataa jab mandalji ko lagata he ki unke bade bhai bisaldevaji aa rahe hai, tab vah jo talab banaaya tha usamen ghode sahit utar jate hai or jal samadhi le lete hai
 Bisaldev is very sad to know this and he builds a huge umbrella and a huge mandara in the middle of the pond in memory of Mandalji and the name of that village is known as Mandalji which is still located near Mewar
 is
 raja bisaldev ke rajya main ek baar ek sher ne aatank failaa rakhaa tha
 He used to take small children of the villages silently at night
 thakhaar kar logon ne tay kiya ki sher kaa bhojan banane ke liye har ghar kaa ek sadsy baari-baari se jayega
 One night, Mandalji's son Hariramji, who is very fond of hunting, goes through there
 raat bitaane ke liye wo ek budhiya se uske ghar main rahane kii anumati maangate hai or budhiya unhen anumati de detii he
 At night, while Budiya is feeding her son, Hariramji sees that Budiya is feeding his son with great love and is also crying
 hariramji budhiya se uske rone kaa kaaran poochhate hai
 Budhiya tells them about the lion, and says that i had two sons, one son has already become the lion's food and tonight it is the turn of the other son
 yah sunakar hariramji budhiya ko kehete hai ki maa main aaj tere bete kii jagah sher kaa bhojan banane ke liye chalaa jaataa hum
 Going into the forest, Hariramji makes an effigy of flour and keeps it in his place and hides himself in a nearby bush
 jab sher aate ke putale par hamalaa karata hai to hariramji jhaadi se baahar aakar apni talwaar ke ek hi waar se sher kii gardan alag kar dete hai
 After this, with the lion's severed head in hand, go to Pushkar Ghat to wash his blood-soaked sword
 pushkar ke raste main lila sevadi naamak ek aurat rahati thi or wo subah severe sabase pehle uthakar pushkar ghat par naha dhokar varah bhagwaan kii puja karne ke liye jaati thi
 He had taken a vow that Varaha would see the face of a person only after worshiping God
 pushkar ghat pahunchakar jab hariramji talwaar ko pani se saaf karke apni mayaan main daalate hai to lila sevadi jo varah bhagwaan kii puja kar rahi hoti he, aahat sunakar peeche mudakar dekhati he
 Due to fear, Hariramji puts forward the severed head of the lion due to which Leela Sewri sees the head of the lion and the torso of the human
 vah kahati he ki yah tumne kya kiya? ab mere jo santaan hogi vah aisi hi hogi, jiskaa sir to sher kaa hoga or sharir aadmi kaa
 Now Leela Sewri says that you have to marry me
 hariramji sochate he ki aisi sati aurat kahan milegi, vah vivaah ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 After some time, a child is born to Hariramji and Leela Sewri, whose head is the head of a lion and the rest of the body
 hariramji us bachche ko lekar ek baag main bargad ke ped kii kochar main chipa kar chale aate hai
 On the second day, the gardener's gardener comes and sees that the garden has become green
 yah kya chamatkaar he or vah puure baag main gum phir kar dekhtaa he to use bargad kii khol main ek navjaat shishu ke rone kii aawaaj sunai detii he or baag kaa mali daud kar bargad ke ped kii khul main se bachche ko uthaa letaa he
 He is stunned to see that the child has a lion's face and a human's body
 vah bachche ko raja ke paas lekar jaataa he
 When King Bisaldev gets to know about the whole thing from Hariramji, then he himself is ready to take up the responsibility of raising the child

 In mechanics, the elasticity is called that property of substances, due to which external force is applied on it, it deforms but on removing the force, it returns to its original position
 yadi vahyabal ke pariman ko dhire-dhire badhaayaa jaay to vikruti samaan rup se badhati jaati he, saath hi saath aantarik pratirodh bhi badhata jaataa he
 But if a force is applied on a substance beyond a limit, the substance cannot fully return to its original state even after removing that external force; Rather, a permanent deformity remains in it
 padaarth kii isi seemaa ko pratyasthata seemaa kehete hai
 The minimum force on the unit area, which brings about a permanent change in numerically, is called the "elasticity limit"
 pratyasthata kii seemaa paar chuke padaarth ko sughaty kehete hai
 Within the elastic limit, the deformation is proportional to the stress acting in the object
 yah ek praayogic tathy he evam hook ke niyam ke naam se vikhyath he
 The force exerted on an object, not acting at a particular point, acts on any plane of it
 falswaroop isaki aantarik pratikriya hoti he
 Therefore, this internal reaction is measured by the force acting on the unit field, which is called stress
 isi prakaar, vahya bal ke falvaroop kisi vastu kii ikai lambaai main utpann parivartan vikruti kehalaati he
 The stress acting in the direction of stress due to external stress on a material and the deformation produced in the same line leads to knowledge of linear elasticity
 kisi padaarth ke liye pratibal evam vikruti kaa anupaat ek sthiraank hota he jise yang pratyasthata gunank kehete hai
 Mathematically, jahaan This linear stress causes linear distortion as well as distortion in the transverse direction
 jaise - kisi taar ke ek sire ko band kar duusare sire par bhaar latakaaya jaay, to taar kii lambaai main vruddhi hogi hi, par saath hi saath iske vyas main bhi kami aa jaaegi
 The transverse deformation produced per unit stress is called the Poisson's ratio for matter
 jab padaarth ko sabhi dishaao se dabaaya jaay, yaa dabaav daalaa jaay, tab vastu ke aaytan main vikruti hoti he
 In this case, the stress that causes the distortion of the unit volume is called the volume elasticity coefficient

 A
 Shivthanu Pillai and npo's Dr
 Herbert Yefremov played an instrumental role in the development of this missile
 The first test of the brahmos missile was carried out on 12 June 2001 from the integrated test site at Chandipur in the Orissa coastal region
 So far several versions of its ramjet technology have been developed
 Based brahmos supersonic missile with 200-300 kg payload can penetrate its targets at a distance of 300 km
 From the ground, the air, the submarines, It can also be launched from anywhere, from the Battle Poto
 The brahmos Cenuvrable version has also been tested so that its route can be changed before it reaches its target after being launched
 There is also a plan to build a sonic missile missile, which will be able to hit its targets at the speed of 7 MAC
 This will have to be done on its own with the aid of Russia, as Russia has signed an international missile technology control treaty, due to which it cannot help other countries in developing a missile with a range of more than 300 km

 Because of which he had handed over his authority completely to the Government of India

 This "undemocratic" system was completely suspended during the reign of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1971
 united kingdom main, evam bharat main bhi, angrezi main ise privipurs kaha jaataa tha jise hindi main "shahi bhatta", "vishesh bhatta" yaa "rajbhatta", ke rup main avatarit kiya ja saktaa he
 It would not be entirely appropriate to call this special allowance to the former dynasties in the Republic of India as "royalty" or "princepers" because unlike other countries in India this provision was made on the basis of treaty
 sanvaidhanik taur par kisi bhi bhatta-praptakarta rajkeey yaa shahi darja praapt nahin tha
 In this context, it would be more appropriate to call this privilege a "personal dictionary", "personal allowance" or special allowance

 san '47 tak adhiktar rajyon ne bharat yaa pakistan main sammilit hone ke vikalp ko sweekaar kar liya or vilay ke upkarnon par hastakshar kar diya
 Some princely states opted to remain independent, out of which Travancore, Bhopal and Jodhpur accepted merger with India as a result of negotiations and Indian diplomacy

 Even after independence, Kashmir, Hyderabad and Junagadh were princely states that did not accept the merger

 On the basis of ring equipment, the princely states were only in possession of communication, defense and foreign affairs to the Government of India
 jiske baad bharat main riyasaton kii vyavastha lagbhag britishkaal kii tarah hi thi
 After 1949, these princely states were completely merged in the Indian constitutional governance and with this, the former rulers were given official status and official recognition of the royal titles of the name Maitra as well as special allowance was given to the rulers
 
 jabaki 1947 tak rajpariwaron ko purv riyasat kii rajkoshiy sampatti rakhane diya gaya tha parantu 1949 ke baad ise bhi le liya gaya or purv shaskaon evam unke uttaradhikariyon ko aaajeevan, jeevanyaapan hetu bharat sarkaar dwaara vaarshik rup se vishesh dhanrashi evam riyaayaten diye jane ke praavdhaan ko shuru kiya gaya
 This system was also completely postponed by passing the 26th Constitutional Amendment in Parliament in 1971
 rajbhate kii dhanrashi kaa moolyankan kai tathyon ke aadhaar par hota tha, jese kii: rajya kaa rajasav, salaami kram, riyasat kii aitihaasik sarthakata, mahatta, aadi

 562 riyasaton main se 102 riyaasaten aisi thim jinhen ₹1,00,000 se zyada kaa vaarshik bhatta miltaa tha
 The 6 princely states received more than ₹ 10,00,000 allowance, the states being Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, Vadoda, Jaipur and Patiala
 iske alaava kai choti jaagiron ko riyasaton dwaara ku naam-maatr kii tuchh riyaayaten milti thim
 For many princely states, the value of allowance was reduced on succession, and even on ordinary floats, the Government of India reduced the concessions on every succession
 nav swatantra bharat main rajbhate par aam raay nakaaratmak thi, saath hi us samay kii aarthik sthiti ke maddenzar is vyavastha ko bahumoolya dhan ke vyarth vyay ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, the official recognition of royal titles was also seen as a completely unconstitutional and undemocratic process

 Keep looking david imail durkhim france ke mahaan samajashastri the
 Along with Karl Marx and Max Weber, he is also said to be the chief architect of modern social science and the father of sociology
 david emil durkhime ko aadhunik samajashaastra kaa sansthaapak or samaaj-vaigyanik shabdaawalee main duniya kaa pehla adhikarik samajashastri mana jaataa he
 He was also the first professor of sociology in the university system of study
 apane academik jivan ke teen dashakon main unhone samajashaastra ko na keval ek vishisht anushaasan ke rup main sthapit kiya, balki is anushaasan kii saidhantik or paddatigat jameen bhi taiyaar kii
 Durkheim's Bill of Sociological Concepts considers humans to be the result of social relations
 is kaaran durkhime kaa samajashaastra apane buniyadi dhaanche main vyaktvaad ke kisi bhi rup ko manyata dene se inkaar karata he
 Durkheim Comt, Marx, Weber etc
 sit close to social thinkers in the context of considering human rights as the product of society
 gauratlab he ki vyakti ko samaaj kaa utpaada maananaa or saamaajik parighatna ko kendriya mahatva dena hi samajashaastra ko anya anushasano kii tulana main ek vishisht swaroop pradaan karata he
 This distinction of sociology was not possible without Durkheim
 haalaanki durkhime ne montescue or ruso jaise vichaarkon se lekar vyavahaarwad, samaajwaad tathaa naitik shiksha jaise masalon par bhi saghan chintan kiya he, parantu samajashaastra ke kshetra main unki chaar rachanaaon— 'da divizan of lebar', 'da rules of sosiolgical mathed', 'suiside' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' ko sabase zyaada mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 David Emile Durkheim was born in a French Jewish family of Epinal, Lorraine
 unke pita or dada donon hi rabbi the
 His early education was also in a religious school, but at the very beginning of his life he decided to live a completely secular life
 ek adhyavsaayee chaatr ke rup main unhone vikhyath echol normel superioyre main daakhila liya or 1886 main apni doctoret ke ansh ke rup main unhone 'da divizan of lebar in socity' kii rachana kii
 In this work, Durkheim shows the difference between modern and traditional societies, suggesting that while modern society is based on the specialization of labor, traditional society runs on shared beliefs
 unke mutabik samaaj ke roopon kaa yah antar niyamon kii vyavastha ke antar ko bhi darshata he
 In this way, modern society is governed by self-regulation, whereas the rules of traditional society are based on external beliefs and approval
 durkhime ke anusaar chunki saajhe vishwaas sarvamaanya naitikta ke praadhikaar par tike hote hai isliye in vishwaason par aadhaarit vyavastha shakti or dabaav ke jariye hi kaayam rah saktaa he
 Whereas self-regulatory or modern society cannot be balanced without elements like freedom, equality and justice
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki saamaajik roopon kii vividhta ko niyamon ke vishisht dhaanche se jod kar dekhne kaa yah sutrikaran aparaadh or kanoon ke samajashastreey adhyayanon ke liye buniyadi prerak tatva rahaa he
 Durkheim believed that due to confusion in traditional and modern forms of society and the tendency to impose traditional laws or rules on modern societies, it has been responsible for many social problems
 aadhunik samaajon kii yah vyakhya durkhime ke krititv kii vishisht uplabdhi maani jaati he
 In this composition, Durkheim also analyzes the social association or affiliation of a person and holds the view that a person needs special social companionship
 durkhime dikhaate hai ki saamaajik sansthaaon ke andar swatah hi ek sansakti kaa tatva hota he jo apane sahabhaagiyon se ek nishchit vyavhaar kii maang karata he
 Durkheim therefore stressed that social processes should be studied instead of individuals
 unke anusaar in saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa thos rup sansthaaon or vyavhaar main abhivyakt hota he jinka anuvikshan ke aadhaar par bhi adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Durkheim calls these processes social factors or social facts
 durkhime ko samajashastreey adhyayan main sankhyikee ke sarjanaatmak upyog karne kaa shrey bhi jaataa he
 In this regard, his creation Suicide is set as a standard
 is kriti main durkhime ne yah pratipaadit kiya tha ki aatmahatya kii alag-alag daron kii vyakhya vyakti ke saamaajik sambaddhta ke staron main pragat antar ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he
 For example, he showed that it is not possible to guess why older men commit suicide based on the individual's personal tendencies
 lekin agar vyakti kii saamaajik sthiti ke karkon jaise uske avivaahit hone yaa samaaj se uske algaav aadi par dhyaan diya jaae to aatmahatya ke kaarnon kii shinaakht kii ja sakati he
 Durkheim uses statistics in his studies to reveal the strength or character of social facts such as forms of mutual association of members of a group
 masalan, agar kisi samooh main aapasi saahchary kii bhaavana kamazor he to uske sadasyon main naitik yaa manovaigyanik samasyaayen paye jane kii sambhaavna zyaada hogi
 Conversely, if there is a deep feeling of companionship in a group, then its members will be more willing to sacrifice for their group
 durkhime kii anya kriti 'da rules of sosiolgilakal mathed' samajashaastra main prayukt kii jane vaali paddatiyon kii aadharbhumi maani jaati he
 Durkheim in this work makes it clear that the central theme of sociology is social system, so it should give priority to institutional and systemic forms of society rather than individual
 is rachana main durkhime samajashaastra ko aise hi saamaajik tathyon kaa adhyayan bataate hai
 According to him, there is a special kind of consistency between these social facts which cannot be called just the accumulated result of their constructive parts
 apni rachana suiside main durkhime isi bindu ko spasht karnaa chaahate the ki aatmahatya jaisi nijee parighatna ko bhi logon ke saahchary-sambandhon tathaa saamaajik banding ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit kiya ja saktaa he
 He argued that things like personal feelings, values or thoughts actually originate from social participation
 durkhime kii do rachanaayen 'da divijan of lebar' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' tatkaaleen saamaajik vyavastha kii padtaal main aadhunik upagamon kaa istemaal karne ke liye jaani jaati he
 In the sociological discourse of modernity, both these works remain an essential reference even today due to their fine and intensive study
 durkhime kaa chintan gahare arth main aadhunik tha
 Even psychoanalysts like Fried were not free from the prejudices of their time and compared primitive brains to mental patients in his work Total and Taboo, while Durkheim proposed in his work Elementary Forms of the Religious Life that logic Thus, the social structures and beliefs of primitive tribes cannot be undermined by the rationale of modern man
 durkhime ke samay main vyaapt raajnneetik duragrahon ko dekhte hue yah ek saahasik vichaar tha
 Since Durkheim considers logic to be a social product, he rejects the idea that proves humans to be inferior or superior
 durkhime ke is hastkshep ne samajashaastra ko ek buniyadi samtawaad se las kiya he
 In considering the social utility of religion in the above work, Durkheim argues that human participation is an understanding of the basic forms of human reasoning - space, time, classification, power, work and reason only through participation in religious customs and rituals
 Earns a sense of wholeness
 is rachana main durkhime yah vichaar bhi pesh karte hai ki pavitrataa kaa saamaajik anubhav saamaajik antahsambandhon ko janm detaa he
 According to him, the birth of a social person and the development of reasoning is also canceled by this process
 is rachana main durkhime yah bhi kehete hai ki samast avadharanaon kii utpatti samaaj se hi hoti he
 Therefore, in order to develop an understanding of logic, language and meaning, it should be studied in which social forms and contexts words and concepts have been used
 yahan durkhime dharm ko samaaj kaa prakaarya bataate hue ek or ahm sutrikaran karte hai ki dharm saamaajik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhane kaa madhyam he
 Durkheim does not directly deny the truth of religious beliefs, but for him the truth of religion is determined by his ability to encourage rituals or not
 unke anusaar sangathit dharmon ko keval vishwaason ke aadhaar par nahin samajha ja saktaa kyonki is tarah ke dharm aksar samaaj ke parmparik roopon ko akshunn rakhane ke liye vyaktigat aasthaa kaa daman karte hue bhi paye jate hai
 Durkheim's formula regarding the role of religion in modern and traditional societies is also worth considering that the functions of religion are not the same in these two different varieties of society
 parmparik samaajon main to dharm saamaajik niyantran kaa aujaar hota he jabaki aadhunik samaajon main uskaa yah prakaarya gair-zaruri ho jaataa he kyonki aadhunik samaajon main vah gyaan-mimasaa kaa prakaarya nibhaane lagata he
 That is why his role in the social system is not the same as before
 durkhime kii yah nishpatti samajashastreey chintan ke lihaaz se ek uplabdhi kahi jaaegi ki manushya ke ek jaivik praani se saamaajik praani main roopantarit hone kii parighatna ko vyakti kii jaivik kshamtaaon yaa manovigyaan ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He argues that the conversion of biological to social is accomplished through social processes
 isliye durkhime ko lagata he ki man or sharir ko do alag iyatta qaraar dene vaala mat keval samaaj kii prakriya se baahar khadey jaivik astitv or saamaajik praani kaa antar darshata he
 According to him the first stage creature cannot be called a rational human being
 ve is baat par bhi jor dete hai ki manushya main tarkbuddhi yaa vyaktitv jaisi chizein samaaj kii prakriya se hi paidaa hoti hai
 Durkheim believed that to maintain a human being as a social animal, social processes and special forms of association are needed
 yani saamaajik manushya ko uske nishchit saamaajik vinyas or sandarbh se alag hataakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Therefore Durkheim warns that if any method of study of psychology, economics or philosophy undertakes to understand social phenomena only on the basis of the accumulated activities of individuals, then it should be held guilty of bypassing the most important aspect like society
 hgfrtewxurkzaima ke chintan or krititv main samtawaad kii spasht pratishtha ke baavjood nariwadi vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki unhone striyon ke mudde par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 To a certain extent, it is true that as a sociologist, no work of Durkheim is concentrated on the female side
 lekin unnisvin sadi ke jis daur main durkhime samajashaastra ko vyavasthit kar rahe the us samay striyon ke prashnon par bahut kam saamaajik chintak vichaar kar rahe the
 In Suicide, he mentions a fatalistic type of suicide, which he mainly associates with women
 durkhime kaa khyaal yah bhi tha ki vivaah purushon ke liye to laabhakaari hota he lekin striyon ke jivan par uskaa nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 In The Division of Labor, Durkheim refers to the indigenous people, stating that the social status of women in such communities was not inferior to that of men, whereas female status in modern societies has become weaker
 tatkaaleen samaaj kii ausat pravriti stri ko komal or kamazor ke rup main chitrit karti thi
 In view of this, Durkheim's vision will surely be called as pioneer
 durkhime kaa avdaan samajashastriyon kii kai pidiyon ke liye prerana, prashnankan, samaveshan or jirah kaa vishay rahaa he
 In the thirties, Talcott Parsons attempted to assimilate Durkheim's work into structural functionalism
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki america main durkhime ke avdaan ko prakaaryawad or pratyakshthawaad ke najaariye se dekha jane laga
 While in France, his vision was used by anthropologists such as levi-strauss who were interested in creating a symbolist anthropology based on the concepts, ideas, and interrelationships of society, as propounded by Durkheim
 lekin durkhime ke vichaaron ko aadhaar banaakar nayi vyakhya karne kaa yah upkram is myne main ekangi sabit hua ki usne durkhime kii mul prastaavnaon ke kuch nishchit hisson kaa hi istemaal kiya
 Marxist stream sociologists have attempted to counterbalance Parsons' approach by emphasizing the radical nature inherent in Durkheim's thinking in his writings, which emphasizes the proving of Durkheim as politically conservative
 samajashastriyon ke ek samooh kaa maananaa he ki durkhime kaa samajashaastra vyakti ko gaun kar detaa he
 But if we look carefully, Durkheim does so intentionally
 unki drushti samaaj ko multah samuhikta main samajhane kaa aagrah karti he tathaa is baat par jor detii he ki agar saamaajik siddhanton kii padtaal or samajashaastra ke vyavhaar main antarvirodhon ke adhyayan ko tavajjo na dekar use vyaktvaad kaa paryaay bana diya jaataa he to samajashaastra kaa buniyadi uddeshy nirast ho jaataa he
 Durkheim's task of sociology is not to provide raw material for philosophical research and then wait for what the philosopher's vision says in his assessment
 iske barakes, durkhime yah israar karte hai ki samajashaastra ko saamaajik tathyon ke adhyayan sambandhi kasautiyon kaa nirmaan khud karnaa chahie
 He rejected the argument of philosophers that social facts have an element of contingency
 is aalochana kaa suchintit jawaab dete hue durkhime ne kaha ki samaaj kii nirantarata banaaye rakhane ke liye kuch khaas tarah ke or sthaayee rup zaruri hote hai

 This effectively included other studios falling under warner-chhatra, such as New Line Cinema and HBO, although BBC, hbo's distribution partner in Europe, announced that it would be able to market the product in both formats, keeping an eye on market forces
 Will continue to release
 This resulted in a chain reaction in the industry, with major US retailers such as best-buy, wal-mart and Circuit City and Canadian chains such as Future Shop removing HD dvds from their stores
