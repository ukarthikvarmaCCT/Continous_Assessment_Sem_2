 a key part of Schopenhauer's pessimism is to predict whether to continue the cycle of life unnecessarily or to face extinction

 The world seems to be as bad as it could have been, rather than giving a personal opinion or viewpoint, such as a glass half full or half empty, that Schopenhauer logically analyzed this concept of pessimism
 Tried to prove it
 But against the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibniz that this is the best of all possible worlds, we may even oppose seriously and honestly the proof that it is the worst of all possible worlds
 For possible means not what we may picture in our imagination, but what can actually exist and last
 Now this world is arranged as it had to be if it were to be capable of continuing with great difficulty to exist; if it were a little worse, it would be no longer capable of continuing to exist
 Consequently, since a worse world could not continue to exist, it is absolutely impossible; and so this world itself is the worst of all possible worlds
 - Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol
 II, Ch
 46

 yah vishwa aavashyak rup se bura he or "aisa nahin hona chaiye"
 Thus throughout, for the continuance of the whole as well as for that of every individual being, the conditions are sparingly and scantily given, and nothing beyond these
 Therefore the individual life is a ceaseless struggle for existence itself, while at every step it is threatened with destruction
 Just because this threat is so often carried out, provision had to be made, by the incredibly great surplus of seed, that the destruction of individuals should not bring about that of the races, since about these alone is nature seriously concerned
 Consequently, the world is as bad as it can possibly be, if it is to exist at all

 In general, these philosophers argue that truth is not to get it right or represent reality, but that it was part of a social system and that language served our purpose at a particular time; To this end, post-structuralism rejects any definitions that claim to have discovered absolute 'truths' or facts about the world

 As they did in the Battle of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used tactical methods against their opponents
 is yuddh main unhone dushman ghudsavaar ko aprabhavi prastut karne ke liye ek khai khod di
 The reason for this fight was to save Medina from attack, with the Banu Nazir and Banu Kayanuka tribes forming an alliance with the Quraysh in revenge for expelling them from Medina during the invasion of Banu Kayanuka and the invasion of Banu Nadir
 muslim vidwaan ebn kathir kehete hai: "kanfederates kaa kaaran yah tha ki banu nadir ke netaaon kaa ek samooh, jise allaah ke macenjar ne al-madina se khaybar tak nishkasit kar diya tha, jisamen sallam bin abu al-hukkaayak, sallam bin mishkam or kinanah bin aar-rabi 'makka gaye jahaan unhone kuraishi ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii or unhen paigambar ke khilaaf yuddh karne ke liye uksaaya " As early as 627, Banu Nadir met the Quraysh of Mecca

 Amrit challenged Muslims to a duel
 jawaab main, ali ebn abi talib ne chunauti sweekaar kar lee, or mohammad dwaara ladane ke liye bheja gaya tha
 As Ali went to fight Amrit ibn Abd Wud, Muhammad said of Ali, “he is the embodiment of all faiths going into an encounter with the embodiment of all disbelief
 " The two warriors were lost in the dust as the duel deepened

 Although the Confederates could deploy their infantry over the entire length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims in close quarters as the former considered it better to fight hand-to-hand with the latter
 chunki muslim sena prithvi se bane tatbandh ke peeche acchhee tarah se khod gai thi, jise khai se liya gaya tha or hamalaavaron ko pattharon or tiron se bambaari karne ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya tha, kisi bhi hamale se badi sankhya main maare gaye
 The Confederates then attempted attacks several times, most notably trying to persuade Banu Quraiza to attack Muslims from the south
 kanfederates se, huyayi ebn akhtab, nirvasit janajati banu nadir ke netaa khabian, muslimon ke khilaaf unke samarthan kii maang main madina laut aae
 By now the Banu Quraiza had tried their best to remain neutral, and were very hesitant about joining the Confederates as they had previously made a pact with Muhammad
 jab akhtab ne unase sampark kiya, to unke netaa ne unhen pravesh karne se inkaar kar diya
 He eventually managed to enter and convince them that the Muslims would certainly be overwhelmed
 vishaal sangheey senaaon kii drushti, jahaan tak ankhon ko dekha ja saktaa tha, sainikon or ghodon ke saath bhoomi par chadhate hue, sangh ke paksh main kuraiya raay ko ghumaya
 News of Quraizah's anticipated renunciation of the pact with Muhammad came out, and Umar immediately informed Muhammad
 kuraija ke gadhon kii ore dushman sainikon ke andolan se is tarah ke andeh ko majboot kiya gaya tha
 Muhammad became concerned about his conduct, and Quraiza realized a serious potential danger
 kuraija ke saath apane samjhaute ke kaaran, unhone janajati ke saath musalamaanon kii seemaa ke saath rakshaatmak taiyaari karne ke liye pareshaan nahin kiya tha
 The Quraiza also had weapons: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armor, and 500 shields
 mohammad ne haal ke ghatnakramon ke vivaran laane ke liye teen pramukh musalamaanon ko bheja
 He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they be loyal to Banu Quraiza, so as to boost the morale of Muslim fighters
 haalanki, unhone kuraija ke hisse par samjhaute ke sambhavit ulanghan kii khabar failaane ke khilaaf chetavanee di, taaki muslim rankon main kisi bhi aatank se bachane ke liye
 The leaders found that the settlement was indeed abandoned and tried to prove them futile by bringing them back to Quraiza, reminding them of the fate of Banu Nadir and Banu Kayanuka at the hands of Muhammad
 netaaon ke nishkarsh mohammad ko ek roopak main sanketit kiya gaya tha: " adal or karah "
 Because the people of Adal and Qarah betrayed the Muslims and killed them at an opportune moment, Maududi believes that the metaphor means that Quraiza was about to do so
 mohammad ne banu kuraija kii gatividhiyon ke bare main apana gyaan chhipaane kaa prayaas kiya; haalanki, afvaahen jald hi kuraiza ke paksh se madina shahar par baari hamale ke fail gayi, jo ki medinance ko gambhir rup se nicha dikhaati thim
 The Muslims found themselves in great difficulties by the day

 Lack of sleep made matters worse

 Only at night, when the attacks ceased due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship

 The Quran describes the situation of Surah al-ahzab: kuraija ke bare main afvaahen sunne ke turant baad, mohammad ne apni suraksha ke liye aantarik logon ko 100 logon ko bheja tha
 Later he sent 300 cavalry to defend the city
 joardaar awaazen, jisamen sena ne har raat prarthana kii, ek badi takat kaa bhram paidaa kiya
 The crisis showed Muhammad that many of his men had reached the limits of their endurance
 unhone ghatafan ko shabd bheja, apane vichlan ke liye bhugtan karne kii koshish kii or unhen waapas le jane par madina kii taarikh kii fasal kaa teesraa hissaa diya
 Although Ghatfan made half the demand, they agreed to negotiate with Muhammad on those terms
 mohammad ne samjhaute ko taiyaar karne kaa aadesh shuru karne se pehle, unhone medin ke netaaon se paraamarsh kiya
 He swiftly rejected the terms of the agreement, the opposition to Medina was never sunk to the level of such humiliation
 baatcheet tut gai thi
 While Ghatfan did not go back, he compromised himself by entering into negotiations with Medina, and increased internal dissolution of the Confederacy
 us bindu par, mohammad ko ek arab netaa nuyam ebn masood se ek yatra mili, jise puure sangh dwaara sammanit kiya gaya tha, lekin jo unhen agyaat tha, gupt rup se islam main parivartit ho gaya tha
 Muhammad asked them to end the siege by creating a dispute between the Confederates
 Nuaym to ek kushal stratagem ke saath aayaa tha
 He first went to Banu Quraiza and warned him about the intentions of the rest of the Confederacy
 agar gheraabandi vifal ho jaati he, to unhone kaha, sangheey yahudiyon ko tyaagane se dar nahin paaegaa, unhen mohammad kii dayaa par chhod degaa
 Thus Qureja should demand union leaders as hostages in exchange for cooperation
 yah salaah kuraiza pehle se hi darane vaale dar par chhu gai thi
 Next Nu'am went to the Confederate leader's Abu Sufyan, warning him that Quraiza had defected to Muhammad
 unhone kaha ki janajati kaa uddeshy bandhakon ke liye sanghatan se poochna he, jaahir he ki sahyog ke badale main, lekin vastav main mohammad ko saunpna he
 Thus mobilization should not give a person as a mortgage

 khagoliki brahmad main avasthit akashiya pindon kaa prakaash, udbhav, sanrachana or unke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan khagoliki kaa vishay he
 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges
 akaash ganga kaa vyas lagbhag ek lakh prakashavarsh he
 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system

 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything

 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 Sukhoi / HAL fifth generation fighter aircraft or Perspective multi-role Fighter) is a fifth generation fighter aircraft developed by India and Russia
 yah roosi sukhoi esayu-57 kii ek vyutpann pariyojna he jise roosi vaayu sena ke liye viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 FGFA is said to be for the Indian version while the joint project is now called Perspective multi-role Fighter
 purna exfee main sukhoi esayu-57 ke kul 43 sudhaar shaamil honge, jisamen stealth, superkruj, unnat sensor, netwarking or ladaaku avionics shaamil hai
 Two different prototypes of the FGFA will be developed, one by Russia and one by India
 bhartiya sanskaran me payalat or sah-payalat / hathiyaar system oparator ke liye do seat hogi
 Following the success of the brahmos project, Russia and India agreed in early 2007 to study and develop a fifth-generation fighter aircraft program
 27 oktober 2007 ko asia times ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main sukhoi ke nideshak mikhail pogosyan ne kaha: "ham 50-50 anupaat main funding, ejineering or bauddhik sampada ko saajha karenge
 " 11 sitambar 2010 ko, yah bataaya gaya tha ki bharat or rus praarambhik dizin anubandh par sahamat hue the
 And it will be sent to cabinet approval
 sanyukt vikaas saude main prayek desh 6 billian dollar kaa nivesh karegaa or exfee ladaaku vimaan kaa vikaas karne main 8-10 saal lagenge
 In December 2010, an mou was signed between Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Russian companies Rosoborone Export and Sukhoi for the initial design of the indo-russian fighter aircraft
 2 sitambar, 2017 ko, bhartiya vaayu sena ne rakrakhaav kaaryakramon kii maang or pariyojna ke saath aage badhane ke liye anichhaa jataai
 Which mentioned the high maintenance costs as the main reasons
 bhartiya vaayu sena ne bataaya ki exfee ladaaku vimaan ke rakrakhaav me bahut zyada laagat aane vaali he

 In this model the intractable risk of the asset, which is often represented by 'beta' in the finance sector, is taken into account and also the expected return on the market and the expected return on the theoretical risk-free asset
 siepiem kaa suzav he ki kisi niveshak kii share poonji kii laagat kaa nirdhaaran 'beta' se hota he

 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line compared to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 β tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko β ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E− Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki β se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e − p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It can be found out by the CAMP that what should be the expected return ie adjustment rate, taking into account the relative risk of a particular asset
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i
e
, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 koi niveshak esa bhi kar saktaa he ki vah apni nidhi kaa kuch hissaa to jokhimayukt sampattiyon main nivesh kare tathaa kuch hissaa nakad bachaakar rakhe, jise jokhim rahit dar par kamai hoti rahe
 
 yahan par jokhimayukt va jokhimamukt kaa anupaat overall return ko nirdhaarit nahin karata - yah sambandh nishchit hi linear he
 In this way it is possible that a certain return can be achieved by any one of the following types: haalaanki ek nishchit pratilabh ke liye, uparokt main se koi ek vikalp hi kushal siddh hoga 
 Since the risk-free asset is not necessarily correlated with any other asset, the second option will usually have less deviation, which would make it more efficient of the two
 yah sambandh prabhavi seemaa par sthit anya portpholios ke liye bhi sahi hoga : ucch pratilabh ke saath kuch nakad- adhik kushal he bajaay - usee pratilabh dar par maatr nimna pratilabh vaale portpholio ke
 For a fixed risk-free rate, there will be only one efficient portfolio that can be combined with cash to achieve a minimum risk position for any return
 yahi market portpholio he
 All investors: dwi-beta model urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The difference between the CPM and bi-beta models is that the CPM model recognizes that the upward and the succeeding betas are the same, whereas the bi-beta model does not believe so
 asi manyata kabhi virale hi thik hoti he, atah dwi-beta model ko hi adhik upyukt mana jaataa he
