 wilson ko lok prashasan ke prakaaryon kii vyakhya karne vaale academik vidwaan, prashaasak, itihaaskaar, vidhivetta or raajnneetijna ke rup main janaa jaataa he

 He died of brain trauma in 1924
 woodro wilson ne swapn main bhi yah nahin sochaa hoga ki ek din vah sanyukt rajya america kaa raashtrapati banegaa
 There are very few people who would have reached this post with political immature personality
 lekin raashtrapati banane ke pashchaat kisi ne itani dridhtaa, sooyeeboojh, raashtra-nirmaan kii dakshata evam karttavya-parayanata se kaary nahin kiya hoga, jitna shaanti ke maseehaa wilson ne
 Despite being a visionary and an idealist, he was the best, more realistic and accomplished political leader after Lincoln
 parantu 1913 main koi bhi yah nahin jaanata tha ki wilson mahaan vyakti banegaa
 No one knew that in spite of all efforts by Wilson for the United States not to participate in the First World War, that nation would have to take a decisive part in the war
 koi nahi jaanata tha ki vah atlantic ke us paar jaakar vishwa ko sthaayee shaanti dene kaa prayaas karegaa or uske praytn kuch europea raajnneetigyon kii swaarthparayanata or gharelu tuchh virodhon kii vedi par nasht honge
 No American president would have seen his own ideals and plans being mercilessly overthrown and defeated by his own people
 wilson raajnneeti shaastra kaa praadhyaapak tha
 Therefore, he was a thinker
 usne america prashasan par vishad granth likhe the
 His idea was that the sharing of power between the executive and the administration could not reconcile the governance
 atev uski ichha thi ki america raashtrapati ko england ke pradhanmantri kii bhaanti shaktishaalee hona chaiye
 When he became President, he undoubtedly implemented his ideas and made it a powerful focal point of President's rule
 usamen saahasik nirbhikta, niruttar kar dene vaali nishkapatata thi
 He believed that satvik works will always triumph and that the representatives of truth should not compromise with untruths, indiscretions and hypocrisy
 apane shasankaal ke aarmabhik varshon main hi usne sampoorn janata kaa dhyaan aakarshith kar liya
 He inspired a sense of dedication, sacrifice and morality throughout national life
 lekin swayan kii satviktaa evam uddeshyon ke prati usamen itnaa garv kar gaya ki vah sochane laga ki jo uskaa virodh karte the ve ishwar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 He lacked Lincoln's humility
 apane chunaav abhiyaan main usne purv ke anudaaravaadi vichaaron ko tyagkar pragativaad kaa naaraa diya tha
 After becoming president, he did not take a compromising life in his personality, although he also praised Brian for his presidential nomination, with the impression that he should 'throw her in the trash'
 ’ vastutah uske vyakitatv main anek gunon kaa sammishran tha
 He was well-versed in the art of pleasant taste and humble bribery, but at the same time he was also of deep morality, kindness and sensitive instinct

 It included elements of the 'former plane', the 'philosopher king' of Plato and the 'prince' of Machiavelli
 linkan kii bhaanti vah samay ke saath apane uttardaayitv ke yogya siddh hua
 Wilson believed in the diplomacy of peace, favoring the resolution of differences by diplomacy of negotiations
 vah adarshavaadi tha
 When he was elected President for the second time, he was deeply concerned that in view of the tense world situation, America could not be placed on the foot of neutrality
 wilson shaanti kaa samarthak tha
 He was well aware that the war of war would have a huge impact on the ideology, philosophy and literature of the Americans from the American state in the world war
 wilson ne america prastaavon ko shaanti ke liye prastut kiya jinhen europea shaktiyon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The US declared neutrality
 4 sitambar 1914 ko congress ke naam apane rajanyik sandensh main wilson ne kaha ki-”yah sthiti hamaare dwaara nirmit nahin he lekin yah hamaare saamne he
 It directly affects us as if we are partakers of the circumstances that gave rise to it
 ham iskaa bhugtan karenge yadhyapi hamane jaanboojhkar ise janm nahin diya he
 "america could not remain untouched by the Great War, yet in 1914 no American knew that they would have to engage in war
 jab germany kii you-boton ne aniyantrit yuddh shuru kar diya to germany ke viruddh antim shaktishaalee tatasth desh america bhi yuddh main pravisht ho gaya
 Wilson sent his famous message to the Congress on 2 April 1917, in which he advised his country to enter the war and protect the world democratic powers
 ukt sandesh main usne kaha, ”jin siddhanton ko ham hriday se chaahate hai, unki raksharth ham avashya ladege
 We will protect democracy
 ham un logon ke adhikaron kii raksha karenge jo kisi nyaaypurna satta kaa aadar karte hai or is prakaar anushaasan main rahakar apane shashan main kuch adhikaar chaahate hai
 We will protect the rights and freedoms of all small countries and nations
 ham avashya chahenge ki saare sansar main swatantra logon ko nyaaypurna swatantrata praapt rahe jisase sabhi deshon main shaanti or suraksha bani rahe or is prakaar sara vishwa swatantra rahe
 Today is the fortunate day of America, when our citizens will spend their blood and their power to protect the principles on which America was born, on the basis of which America got happiness and prosperity and that priceless peace
 Which he has been observing in terms of great importance
 “ Peaceful Wilson was constrained
 america ke bhavishya ke liye yah atyant mahatv kii baat thi ki use aisa vyakti raashtrapati ke rup main mila tha jisane is yuddh ke aadhaar ko ‘moksh or sudhaar kii sangya’ main parinat kar diya
 a part of the speech of 17 January 1917 expresses his sensitive thoughts towards the whole of humanity - "peace without victory of any party, principle of self-judgment for each caste, collective, freedom, limitation of arms and weapons, engaging System of collective protection for eradication of treaties and to prevent invasion
 “ 2 april ko wilson ne desh kii sarvocch pratinidhi sanstha congress ke saamne upasthit hokar yuddh kii ghoshnaa karne kii anumati maangi
 "let this great peaceful people go towards war - the most terrible and destructive war
" 
le janaa bhayanak baat he
 Civilization itself is swinging in the pan of crisis, but justice is more valuable than peace and we will fight for such things which have been dear to us
 loktantr ke liye, aise logon ke adhikaron ke liye jo shashan kaa isiilie maan karte hai ki apni sarkaar main unki sunwaayee ho, chote rashtron ke adhikaron or swatantrata ke liye logon ko aise sanghathanon dwaara vishwa ke nyaay shashan ke liye jo sabhi rashtron ko shaanti or suraksha dilaae or ant main sarv vishwa ko swatantra ban saken
 You can dedicate your life and your everything to such folk work
 is abhiyaan ke saath ki vah din aa gaya he, jab america kaa aparaa rakt or shakti, apane siddhanton ke liye jinhone use janm or sukh-shaanti di he, jise usne surakshit rakhaa he, kharch kerani chahie yani ishwar kii krupa rahi to vah iske atirikt or kuch kar bhi nahin saktaa

 The words emanating from his heart were so poignant that the whole nation jumped on his voice in the war for the victory of civilization over the barbarism of democracy over dictatorship
 samudr paar ke deshon main vah na keval ek adwitiya mahapurush ke rup main prakat hua, na keval ek shaktishaalee raashtra ke netaa ke rup main pahachaanaa jane laga, jo vishwa main shantipriy, sukhad va vyavasthit jivan kii raksha ke liye avatarit hua ho
 In the words of Nevins and Koumager - "power as much as power, power without any hindrance or limitation" was promised by President Wilson and succeeded in imposing nation fanatics
 is vachan kii purti ke liye avilamb karyrat ho gaya
 No government before it had shown more intelligence and efficiency in war
 iske purv americavsiyon ne bhi aisi sphurti, saadhan-sampannataa or avishkaar buddhi kaa prabhaavshaalee pradarshan nahin kiya tha
 "peace without victory" had become the slogan of war
 yuddh-viraam sandhi ke pashchaat wilson jab apane sachiv kii salaah na maanakar disambar, 1918 main paris shaanti sammelan main pahunchaa to uskaa ‘shaanti ke maseehaa’ ke rup main swaagat hua
 At that time in Europe, there was a feeling that Wilson is the only person who has risen above the rage and hatred of various nations and is the protector of humanity
 atah jab yah darshanik raja apane siddhanton kii pustika haath main lekar sainik-shakti se las, sandhi kii sharten nirdhaarit karne aayaa to europe kii janata ne uske sammaan main hriday khol diya
 It received unprecedented reception in all countries
 jab vah paris pahunchaa to francisi use dekhakar anand-vibhor ho uthe
 He was praised by a large crowd on the streets and the newspapers praised him
 vastav main sabhi kii ankhen uski ore lagi thim
 The victors hoped for justice, victories of mercy and common manpower
 wilson is sammelan main shaanti kaa deep banakar aayaa tha
 He did not want the Paris Conference to become a stronghold of vested interests like the Vienna Congress of 1815
 parantu vah andaaj nahin laga paaya tha ki vijeta rashtron main swaarth kii gandh rahati he or yadi vah anya tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhata to vah us jaal yaa dhokhe se batch jaataa jisamen vah swayan apane adarshavaad ke kaaran buree tarah ulajh gaya
 His sacred objectives were consumed in front of the conquering nations
 wilson ne apane vichaaron ko prasiddh 14 sutron ke rup main prastut kiya
 The first of its 14 sources was that peace agreements would be made publicly, there would be no secret agreement
 in siddhanton kii mitrarashtron ke raajnneetigyon ne bhi saraahna kii thi
 Apart from the above principles, what else did they have to solve post-war problems? And the defeated nations also agreed to these principles but nothing could be done in front of the ideals and principles in the power-loving nations
 is sammelan main bhi rashtravaadi vichaaron, vyaktigat swaarthon kaa bolbalaa rahaa, jinka vienna congress main praadhanya rahaa tha
 Both Clemensi of France and Lloyd of England succeeded in imposing their dogma on Wilson
 aar0bi0 mobaat ne ‘european diplomasi’ main likhaa he ki ”klemenso praatavkaal yah vaakya duharaaya karata tha- main rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa samarthan karuunga
 "but when Orlando of Italy was asked what is your opinion about the League of Nations, he replied that" We would undoubtedly welcome the establishment of the League of Nations, but the question of Fume should be fixed
 “ wilson sampoorn sammelan main akelaa pad gaya tha
 After the Vienna Congress, there was no such global conference in Europe on such a large scale
 princeton main raajnneeti-darshan kaa yah bhootpurv professor ek pratibhashali vaktaa tathaa adarshavaadi vichaarak tha
 He was a man of strong beliefs with a high degree of political foresight, but not so much diplomatic competence as to prepare other representatives for lenient dealings with defeated nations
 stennard baker ke shabdon main ”jis kisi ne bhi usko kaam karte dekha, uski kabhi himmat nahin hui ki vah wilson ke samaksh athwa uski peeth peeche ninda karne kaa saahas karata
 "wilson believed that mankind could be protected only by the establishment of the League of Nations, so he wanted to make it an indispensable part of all peace
 kintu vah maansik drushti se loyad jorge tathaa klemenso ke samaan kushagra nahin tha or apane purv-nirdhaarit vichaaron par vishesh rup se bharosa rakhata tha, atah vah kootneeti ke kshetra main or raajnneetik saudebaaji ke nausikhia siddh hua
 Other countries took full advantage of his idealism and excessive enthusiasm to establish a League of Nations
 anya desh rashtrasang ke nirmaan kii baat maan len, iske liye wilson sab kuch tyaagane ke liye taiyaar tha, yahaan tak ki rashtrasang ke liye vah apane 14 sutron ke anek siddhanton kii avhelnaa karne ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 According to Paul Birdsall's statement, he was successful in getting most of his sayings in the name of the League from Britain, France and Japan on all other questions besides the problem of compensation
 chini janata dwaara baas hua shantung kaa pradesh wilson ke aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth ke aadhaar par china ko milanaa chaiye tha, kintu wilson ne rashtrasang kii sthapana ke liye anya mahashaktiyon kaa sahyog praapt karne kii ichha se ise japan ko dene kaa nirnay kiya
 This decision was a rebuff by Wilson himself
 phir bhi, paris-sammelan main yadi parajiton ke saath thodi narmi barti gai to vah wilson ke kaaran hi
 There was no doubt that if Wilson had not been in the conference, Lloyd George and Clemenso would have known what to do
 wilson hi unki aseem aakankshaon par ankush lagaataa rahaa
 If Wilson had not been there, France would have died by erasing Germany's nomination
 wilson ke do uddeshy the
 First just agreement according to which the boundaries of nations are determined on the principle of self-decision so that mutual peace can be established
 dwitiya, rashtrasang kii sthapana
 In the first objective, he did not succeed because the peace that was done was imposing peace and not on the basis of self-judgment or peace of negotiation
 parantu use duusare uddeshy main safalataa praapt hui
 The idea of a League of Nations was not original and many people contributed to clarify this idea in many countries, but the League of Nations that was finally founded was Wilson's creation and the temple of his ideals
 kuch vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki wilson ne swayan paris main aakar ek baari bhul kii
 If he had stayed in Washington and ordered the American delegates, it would have been more likely that his influence would have been more widespread, but Wilson was most concerned with the League of Nations and his desire was to make the legislation of the world institution his own
 vastav main yah bahut durbhagyapurna rahaa ki jahaan sammelan main uski upasthiti swayan sammelan ke liye hitkar na rahi, vahaan apane desh se dur hokar vah america janata se bhi sampark sthapit na rakh sakaa jiskaa dushprinaam yah hua ki uske dwaara poshit rashtrasang ko uske swayan ke desh ne hi asweekaar kar diya
 The US Senate did not accept Wilson's offer of membership of the League of Nations
 1918 main congress ke chunaavon main wilson virdohi republican dal ko congress ke donon sadanon main bahumat praapt ho gaya or seenet ne rashtrasang ke vidhaan evam varsay kii sandhi ko sweekaar karne ke masavide ko radd kar diya
 It was a sad defeat of a great prophet of humanity
 woodro wilson kaa maananaa tha ki lok prashasan ko raajnneeti se pruthak hona chahie
 He is generally remembered for underlining divisions in administration and politics
 wilson ke anusaar kisi samvidhan kii rachana to aasaan he kintu usko kriyanvit karnaa kathin he
 He laid special emphasis on the study of the field of implementation

 The specific environment in which we are going to introduce the newly discovered organism may change in the form of mutual harmony between the living organisms, and it is imperative that we be extremely careful of people so that mutual relations in the environment are essential

 Freud referred to metamorphic mania, in which mental disorganization converts into physical symptoms, and anxiety mania, which has only mental symptoms
 unmaad ke bare main froid kaa anveshan pramanik he
 From Freud's point of view, two things are mainly found in the disease of mania: unmaad praaia: kamvritti sambandhi anubhutiyon kaa pun:sphuran hota he
 Often those people are victims of mania disease whose work force is not developed properly

 This is what he says when a maniac patient is asked something because of a distorted mood: "" i don't know, i don't remember some such things "" - this means that he doesn't want to say anything because it gives his unknown The unconscious mind hurts the euphoria

 Those in the family who have or have had this disease are more likely to develop mania
 atyaadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav, tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 The most suitable method of treatment of this disease is free association

 Some poems and plays written in Brajbuli have also been found in Nepal
 is kavyabhasha kaa upyog shatabdiyon tak hota rahaa he
 From the 15th century to the 19th century AD, verses written in this poetry are found
 yadhyapi "brajabuli sahitya" kii lambii parampara rahi hai, phir bhi "brajabuli" shabd kaa prayog isvi san kii 19veen shatabdi main miltaa he
 So far, the use of this word has been found only in the composition of Bengali poet Ishwar Chandra Gupta
 "brajabuli" shabd kii vyutpatti tathaa brajabuli bhashaa kii utpatti ko lekar vidwaanon main bahut matbhed he
 It is necessary to clarify one thing here that Brajbuli is not Braj Bhasha
 vyakaran sambandhi donon kii apni-apni alag-alag visheshtaayen hai, vaise bhashatattav kii drushti se yah sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki brajabuli kaa sambandh brajabhasha se he
 The use of the words Brajbhasha is seen more in the terms of Brajbuli

 It is necessary to get a little information about the non-destructive

 Thus, the form of apabhramsa which was used between the later dialects and the developed dialects of different regions and which was used for the creation of literature, is called Avahath
 dow sunitikumar chatarji ne batalaaya he ki shauraseni apbhransh arthath avahatth madhyadesh ke alaava bengal aadi pradeshon main bhi kavyabhasha ke rup main apana aadhipaty jamaaye hue tha
 It is necessary to note one thing here, that even though it was accepted as a poetic language, it was natural that the impression of a particular province would be on it, so even if it was a poetic language, we would direct the words of different circles, publication etc
 Huh
 "brajabuli" shabd kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main kuch logon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki "brajavali boli" kaa roopaantar "brajaali buli" main hua or "brajaali buli" "brajabuli" bana

 Similarly, a windmill that transforms the air of high velocity cannot be used by the slow velocity of air
 saamanyat: yadi vaayu kii gati 320 kimi prati ghanta se kam hoti he to is vayushkti ko suvidhapurvak hawachakki main kaary main parinat karnaa avyaavhaarik hota he
 Similarly, if the speed of air is more than 48 km per hour, it is very difficult to convert the energy of this air power into work in a windmill
 parantu vaayu kii gati sabhi rituon main tathaa sabhi samay is seemaa ke bheetar nahin rahati he isliye iske prayog par na to nirbhar rahaa ja saktaa he or na iskaa adhik prachaar hi ho saktaa he
 Despite the above difficulties, much attention has been given to the commercial development of wind power in many countries

 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history

 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
