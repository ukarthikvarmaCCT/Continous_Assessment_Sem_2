 vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida kehalaata he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vachanpaalan, qaraar athwa kaul ke nirvaah ko sampoorn vishwa main or visheshat: bharat main bada mahatv diya gaya he
 The story of Dasharatha, the son of exile and self-demise of a son for pledge in Indian history, is popular

 It had certain formalities without which perfection would not have been attained
 bharat main bhi naarad or brihaspati ke granthon main vastuvikray, rin, saajhedaari or abhikartrutv ke sambandhon kaa ullekh he
 But the nature of the present contract is different from that, although the link of its development can also be linked to them
 vartmaan sanvida kii visheshta uski kanoonee manyata he
 Every promise or agreement which is enforceable by law or which can be upheld by law is a contract
 pracheen kaal main is kanoonee manyata par vishesh bal nahin tha balki bal tha uski aupchaarikaataaon main se yadi koi aupchaarikta kam rah jaati thi to sanvida purna nahin hoti thi
 Although the practice of contract in its various forms was in the business relations of the society, the term "contract" was discovered much later
 sanvida shabd bahut vyapak he
 Parts of the contract itself are sale, loan, mortgage, deposit, partnership, motherhood, marriage etc
 parantu apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ne nayaa kanoonee arth grahan kar liya he
 In India, its act was made in 1872 AD and contracts are regulated by the same Indian Contract Act

 a contract in its present form is a legal promise or an enforceable agreement by law

 When at least two people are unanimous in relation to doing or abstaining from something, then it is called agreement
 qaraar ke liye kam se kam do pakshon kaa hona aavashyak he
 If "A" proposed to "B" that "B" make a picture of "A", he would give "B" five hundred rupees for this work
 "a" ke dwaara yah prastaav he
 If "B" accepts that he will make a picture for "A" in five solar rupees, then it is an agreement that is enforceable by law and can be made effective
 arthath ek vyakti akelaa hi koi qaraar nahin kar saktaa he qaraar ke liye qaraar sambandhi baton par ubhay paksh kii maansik ekaatmata hona aavashyak he
 This means that in relation to everything related to the agreement, the common parties understand the same meaning
 aisa na ho ki ek paksh ek arth or doosraa paksh doosraa arth samajhe
 "A" has two motorcars, one Ford and the other Chevrolet
 vah apni ford car paanch hajaar main bechnaa chahta he
 He offered to sell that car with "B"
 parantu "ba" ne "shevarlyt" car samajhakar use kharidne kii sweekruti pradaan kar di
 This agreement will not happen because "A" and "B" did not result in mental monotony in relation to the motorcar
 motorcar se "a" ne ford motorcar or "ba" ne shevarlyt car samajhi
 It is clear from the above statement that the proposal becomes an agreement only after acceptance
 prastaav vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai parantu saadhaarant: unka vargeekaran paanch shreniyon main kiya gaya he : 1
 Specific proposal, when a proposal is made to a certain person or persons, it is called a specific proposal
 chunki prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, at: isamen sweekaar karanevaala vyakti, jise swikarta kaha jayega, nirdisht hota he
 In this, the acceptance notice must be given by the acceptor to the proposer
 2
 saamaanya prastaav vah prastaav he jo nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se nahin kiya jaataa balki sansar kaa koi vyakti ise sweekaar kar saktaa he
 That is why, like a specific proposal, it is not mandatory to give the information of acceptance to the proposer
 prastaav main prakatit or icchit kaary ko karnaa hi is prastaav kii sweekruti maani gai he
 3
 Explicit proposals are those proposals which are made in verbal or written form but clearly
 4
 sankethik prastaav ye prastaav shabdon dwaara na hokar kaary dwaara kiye jate hai
 There is a proposal to take passengers from one place to another in lieu of tickets, the train has to come to the station
 yah saamaanya prastaav kaa bhi udaarahan he kyonki iskaa swikarta purvanishchit nahin he
 5
 Continuous proposal In this proposal, a proposal to supply 5000 mana of wheat at a fixed rate
 is prastaav kii sweekruti ke uparant bhi ek paksh turant hi sampoorn gehun kharidne ko yaa doosraa paksh bechney ko baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Like the proposal and according to it determines a particular method or system of acceptance, there determines that method or system of acceptance, if there is no acceptance by that method or system of acceptance, then the proposer is forced to accept by that system Should give
 parantu jahaan sweekruti kii kisi pranali yaa vishisht vidhi kaa ullekh nahin ho, vahaan kisi yuktiyukt, sangat or uchit pranali dwaara sweekruti di ja sakati he
 Acceptance can also be explicitly by words or by act in symbolic form
 tikat lekar gantavy sthaan ko janevaali railgadee par yatri kaa baithna hi kaary dwaara company ke prastaav kii sweekruti he
 Mental acceptance alone cannot be considered acceptance
 shabdon main athwa kaary dwaara uski abhivyakti bhi aavashyak he
 Performing the tasks specified in the proposal is also considered acceptance of certain proposals
 parantu yah aavashyak he ki swikarta is kaary ko karne ke purv se hi prastaavak kii sharte jaanata ho
 If the acceptor performs the work specified in the offer without the knowledge of the offer, it cannot be considered acceptance of the offer
 ek vyakti goridutt ne apane bhattije kii khoj ke liye apane munim lalman ko bheja
 After Lalman's departure, Gauridutt announced a 501 rupee award for his nephew
 lalman munim gauridatt ke bhattije ko khoj laayaa or puraskaar kii maang kii
 The decision was made that since Lalman was not informed of the condition of the award before the search of the boy, nor was it known to receive the award, Lalman's task of finding the lost boy could not be considered acceptance of Gauridutt's proposal
 prastaav se utpann laabh ko sweekaar karnaa bhi upyukt dashaon main prastaav kii sweekruti samajhi jaati he
 Sitting in a bus from Varanasi to Prayag is acceptance of the offer of the bus owner and the acceptor is obliged to pay the bus fare
 sweekruti prastaav ke kaayam rahane kii dasha main honi chahie
 If the proposal has been nullified or has been rejected or withdrawn by the proposer, acceptance will also be null and void
 prastaavak kii soochna swikarta ko or prastaav kii sweekruti kii soochna prastaavak ko milanaa aavashyak he
 When the information of the proposal is received by the person to whom the proposal is made, then the convection or communication of the proposal is deemed complete
 "k" ne apni ghadi 150) main "kha" ko bechney kaa prastaav patr dwaara "kha" kii preshit kiya
 As soon as the letter "B" is received, the offer for "A" will be completed
 sweekrurta ke liye pruthak pruthak hota he
 When the acceptor sends his acceptance to the proposer in such a way that his withdrawal is not in the hands of the acceptor, the acceptance against the proposer reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa sanvahan purna samajha jayega parantu swikarta ke viruddh nahin
 Convection of acceptance against acceptance against the acceptor will be complete when the acceptance reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa patr "k" ke naam daalate hi sweekruti kii pabandi "k" naamak prastaavak ke viruddh ho jaaegi parantu swikarta "kha" ke viruddh nahin
 Completion of convection against "B" will occur when "A" receives its letter of acceptance
 jab prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab donon do sthanon par hon to sanvahan kaa madhyam dak : patr yaa taar : hota he
 It is clear from the above statement that the letter of offer is not completed as soon as it is left by the proposer, but is completed only after reaching the acceptor
 isse yah bhi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab tak swikarta apni sweekruti kaa patr dak main nahin chhod detaa kyonki tab sweekruti kaa waapas liya janaa swikarta ke vash ke baahar ho jaataa he
 Every offer left by the acceptor in the mail is completed against the proposer
 upar kaha ja chukaa he ki sweekruti swikarta ke viruddh tab purna hoti he jab prastaavak ko praapt ho jaae
 Acceptors leave their acceptance letters in the post office before the proposer receives them, against the acceptor is also completed
 sweekrutapatr der main pahunchne yaa raste main kho jane par bhi prabhavakaari rahata he kyonki aisa mana gaya he ki dak vibhaag kii asaavadhaanee yaa bhul kaa koi prabhaav sanvida ke pakshon par padana nyaaysangat nahin he
 But if the letter for convection is not given in the post to the postman, then it is not enough convection because it is not included in the duties of the postman to leave every person's letter in the post
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium 1872 i
 kii dhara 10 ke anusaar aise sabhi qaraar sanvida maane gaye hai jo Negotiable parties swatantra sahmati se kiye jaae, Whose returns and objectives are valid and ukt adhinium dwaara nisatva na ghoshit kiye gaye hon
 It has also been clarified in this section that the above definition will not affect any such law, jiske dwaara kisi sanvida kaa likhit, yaa panjikrut sakshiyon kii gavaahi ke saath hona aavashyak he
 All such persons are considered to be contractual, who are adult, healthy minded and are not disqualified by any law
 falswaroop Minor, vikrut mastishkvaale vyakti yaa unmatta, jadbuddhi tathaa nashe main chur rahanevaale, And such persons, who are disqualified to contract by law, such as foreign enemies, foreign emperors or their representatives, enemies of the country, criminals etc
, cannot contract
 avasyak vyakti swatantra buddhi se apane laabh haani kaa nirnay nahin kar saktaa
 Hence, he is not considered as contractable
 vikrut mastik vaale vyaktiyon main agar vikruti asthaayee ho hri yani kabhi mastishk vaale vyaktiyon main agar vikruti asthaayee ho hri yani kabhi mastishk vikrut or kabhi swasth rahata ho hri to aise vyakti vikrutikaal main to nahin parantu mastishk kii swasthata ke kaal main sanvida kaa yogya paksh ho sakate hai1 apradhi kaa dandbhog ke samay sanvida karne kaa adhikaar nilambit ho jaataa he parantu dandbhog yaa kshamaprapti ke pashchaat use sanvida karne kii kshamta pun: praapt ho jaati he
 a person declared insolvent is also deprived of the ability to contract
 sanvida ke pakshon kii sahmati kaa swatantra hona sanvida kii ek pramukh aavashyaktaa he
 If the consent is not independent then the contract will be affected by it
 sahmati us dasha main swatantra maani jaati he jab yah 1
 Force or tragedy, 2
 avaanchit prabhaav, 3
 Treachery, 4
 bhrant kathan, yaa bhranti dwaara prabhavit nahin hui ho or na praapt kii gai ho
 The definition of force or tragedy is given in the Indian Contract Act
 uske anusaar balpravartan yaa traas ke chaar rup he : Performing acts punishable and punishable by the Indian Penal Law or karne kii dhamkee dena, chaahe us sthaan par jahaan yah kaary kiya jaae bhartiya dand vidhaan lagu ho yaa nahin, Unlawfully withholding the property of any person; Or roak rakhane kii dhamkee dena
 The purpose of this force or tragedy should be to make someone a party to the contract
 avaanchit prabhaav kii paribhaasha sanvida adhinium kii dhara 16 main di gai he
 According to him, the contract is said to be motivated by undue influence whose relations of the parties are such that one party uses that particular position with the will of the other party
 mata pita or bachche, abhibhavak or palya, vakil ore muvakkil, doctor or rogi, guru or shishy aadi ke sambandh aise hi hote hai jinamein pratham paksh duusare kii ichchhaaon ko apane vishisht sambandh ke kaaran prerit karata he
 In order to prove undue influence, it is also necessary to prove that in fact, on the other side of the party of special status, used its special position for its unfair advantage
 yadi yah baat siddh nahin hoti to keval vishisht sthiti ke hi kaaran koi sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prabhavit yaa parityajya nahin samajhi jaaegi
 This is described in Section 17 of the Contract Act
 uske anusaar sanvida ke kisi paksh dwaara yaa uski sajeesh se yaa uske abhikarta dwaara duusare paksh yaa uske abhikarta ko dhokhaa dene yaa chhalane yaa sanvida se sammilit hone ke liye prerit karne ke hetu nimnaankit kaary chhalkapat kehalaayenge : A) to tell the facts, which he does not believe in the truth, kha) aise tathy ko chhipaana jiskaa use gyaan yaa vishwaas na ho; C) to give a promise that does not wish to be fulfilled; gha) aisa kaary karnaa yaa usase virat hona jise kanoon vishesh rup se chhalkapat ghoshit karata ho; 4) To do other deceptive tasks
 qaraar ke sambandh main vichaar karte hue yah kaha gaya he ki ubhay paksh ke bich maansik mataiky kaa hona aavashyak he
 The fallacy is related to this
 isamen ek paksh ek vastu yaa baat or doosraa paksh duusari vastu yaa baat samajhataa he
 As a result, the contract seems to be seen in the upper way, but there is virtually no contract due to confusion
 ye bhrantiyaan kai prakaar kii hotin hai
 An example of confusion regarding content is given by Chevrolet and Ford Motor Cars in the pre-section
 isi prakaar sanvida ke paksh kii pahchaan main bhi bhranti sambhav he
 "A" contracted as "B", if it was in fact "B" and not "C", then it is a misconception of the identity of the party
 sanvida kii prakruti yaa arth sambandhi bhi bhranti ho sakati he
 If one of the later parties signs an agreement on the other party stating the application for taking the opportunity later, then the other party gets confused about the form or nature of the contract
 aisi dasha main hastakshar banaanevaale kaa mastishk uske hastakshar ke saath nahin he
 Yield is an essential element for covenant
 bina pratifal ke koi prasanvida nahin ho sakati; or yadi vah ho bhi to ni:satv yaa avaidh hoti he
 The return must also be valid
 udhaaharan swaroop "a", "ba" ko "sa" kii hatya ke liye 5000 ru
 detaa he or "ba" hatya ke liye vachan detaa he
 Here this contract is free because its reward is forbidden by murder law
 is prakaar nimnlikhit prakaar ke pratifal avaidh hote hai - 1
 The returns which are forbidden by law
 yadi koi pratifal spashtyaa yaa sankethik rup se kanoon dwaara varjit ho to uske aadhaar par nirmit prasanvida ni:satya hoti he
 This will become clear from the above example
 2
 yadi koi aisa pratifal ho jisase kisi adhinium kii koi vyavastha bhang hoti ho yaa nishphal hoti ho to vah pratifal avaidh mana jayega
 3
 Those returns which are fraudulent are considered illegal
 4
 vah pratifal jiske dwaara kisi vyakti ke sharir yaa sampatti ko haani pahunchati ho avaidh hota he
 For example, a promises to pay five hundred rupees to the editor of a newspaper if the offending details about Editor b are printed
 yahan pratifal avaidh he kyonki isse ba kii pratishtha par aghat pahunchataa he
 5
 Returns that are immoral are illegal
 6
 lokaneeti ke viruddh pratifal avaidh hote hai, jaise shatru ke saath vyapaar karnaa
 Contracts tending to cause harm to public service, contracts strangling lawsuits related to punishable offenses are disqualified
 vaidhanik karrwai kaa durupyog karne kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, aisi sanvida jau naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi jo naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi vyavask vyakti ko shaadi karne se rokane ke liye sanvida, ityadi bhi lokaneeti ke viruddh evam ni:satv hotin hai
 The invalidation of even one of the aims and rewards makes the contract null
 yadi sanvida kaa uddeshy anshat: avaidh ho tab bhi sanvida ni:satv ho jaati he, yadi uske avaidh ansh ko vaid ansh se pruthak na kiya ja sake
 If the illegal share of the consideration or purpose can be separated from the valid portion, then the valid portion will be enforceable and the invalid share will be disqualified
 jaise "ba" ne "a" ko ek pratigyapaatr dwaara 2000 rupye dene kaa vachan diya jinamein se 1500 rupye purana rin tha or 500 rupye jue main haari rakam thi
 In this, the legitimate part can be separated from the illegal part; Therefore, this covenant will be valid for 1500 rupees, but 500) will be disqualified
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium ke antargat ni:satv ghoshit qaraar kanoon dwaara pravartaneey nahin ho sakate, yadhyapi usamen sanvida ke anya tatv purnat: vidyaman bhi hon

 Nathuram Vinayak Godse, or Nathuram Godse, was a staunch Hindu nationalist supporter who shot and killed Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on 30 January 1948 in New Delhi
 godse, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pune se purv sadsy the
 Godse believed that Gandhi had supported the Muslim side of India and Pakistan at the time of partition of India
 jabaki hinduon par ho rahe atyaachaar par apni ankhen moond lee thi
 Godse together with Narayan Apte and 6 people had planned this massacre
 ek varsh se adhik chale mukaddame ke baad 8 navambar 1949 ko unhen mrityudand pradaan kiya gaya
 Although the arguments of exchange were offered by Gandhi's sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, those arguments were turned down by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Maharajyapal Chakraborty Rajagopalachari and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel
 15 navambar 1949 ko godse ko ambala jail main phaansi de di gai
 Nathuram Godse was born on 19 May 1910 in the Chittapavan Marathi family at the Baramati salt place near Pune in the state of Maharashtra, India
 inke pita vinayak vamanrav godse post aphis main kaam karte the or mata lakshmi godse ek gruhani thim
 The birth name of Nathuram was Ramachandra
 inke janm se pehle inke mata-pita kii santaanon main teen putron kii alpakaal main hi mrityu ho gayi thi keval ek putree hi jivit bachi thi
 Therefore, his parents, considering the curse on the life of male children, had prayed to God that if there is a son now, he will be raised like a girl
 isi manyata ke kaaran balak ramchandra kii naak bachapan main hi chhidava diya gaya or manyata anusaar ramchandra ko baalkaal main apane naak main ek nath
 Because of this, the boy Ramchandra was called as Nathuram
 brahman parivaar main janm hone ke kaaran nathuram kaa bachapan se hi dharmik kaaryon main gahari ruchi thi
 According to his younger brother Gopal Godse, he used to speak such strange verses in his mind during his childhood which he had never read
 dhyanavastha main ye apane parivaar waalon or unki kuladevi ke madhya ek sutara kaa kaary kiya karte the parantu yah sab 16 varsh tak kii aayu tak aate-aate swat: samaapt ho gaya
 Although he had his initial education in Pune, he left his schooling in the middle of high school and did not take any formal education thereafter
 dharmik pustakon main gahari ruchi hone ke kaaran ramayana, mahabharat, gita, pu raanon ke atirikt swami vivekananda,swami dayanand, bal gangadhar tilak tathaa mahatma gandhi ke sahitya kaa inhone gaharaa adhyayan kiya tha
 In the early days of his political life, Nathuram joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 ant main 1930 main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhi chhod diya or akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha main chalaa gaya
 He also edited two newspapers named Pioneer and Hindu Rashtra
 ve mohammad ali jinna kii algaavvaadi vichaar-dhara kaa virodh karata tha
 Initially, he supported the programs of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, but later he became a strong opponent of Gandhi because of the consistent and repeated policy of discrimination against Hindus and the Muslim appeasement
 1940 main hyderabad ke tatkaaleen shaasha nizaam ne uske rajya main rahane vaale hinduon par balaat jajia kar lagane kaa nirnay liya jiskaa hindu mahasabha ne virodh karne kaa nirnay liya
 The first batch of Hindu Mahasabha activists went to Hyderabad under the leadership of Nathuram Godse on the orders of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the then president of the Hindu Mahasabha
 hyderabad ke nizaam ne in sabhi ko bandi bana liya or karawas main kathor dand diye parantu baad main harkar usne apana nirnay waapas le liya
 The partition of India in 1947 and the communal violence at the time of partition gave Nathuram a great boost
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue beesvin sadi kii us sabase bady traasadee ke liye mohandas karamchand gandhi hi sarvaadhik uttaradaayi samaj main aaye
 According to the decision taken at the time of partition, India was to give 75 crores rupees to Pakistan, out of which 20 crores had been given
 usee samay pakistan ne bharat ke kashmir praant par akraman kar diya jiske kaaran bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru or gruhamantri sardaar ballab bhai patel ke netritv main bharat sarkaar ne pakistan ko 55 karod rupee na dene kaa nirnay kiya, parantu bharat sarkaar ke is nirnay ke viruddh gandhi anshan par baith gayi
 Upset about this decision of Gandhi, Nathuram Godse and some of his colleagues decided to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi
 gandhi ke anshan se dukhi godse tathaa unke kuch mitron dwaara gandhi kii hatya yojananusaar nai dilli ke birla house pahunchakar 20 janvari 1948 ko madanlaal paahwa ne gandhi kii prarthana-sabha main bam feka
 According to the plan, Gandhi was to be killed at the time of the chaos caused by the bombings, but at that time his pistol was jammed and he could not move at all
 is kaaran nathuram godse or unke baaki saathi vahaan se bhagkar pune waapas chale gayi jabaki madanlaal paahwa ko bheed ne pakad kar police ke hawaale kar diya
 Nathuram Godse returned from Pune to Delhi to kill Gandhi and there were Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan who were visiting refugee camps
 usee dauraan unako ek sharnaarthi mila, jisase unhone ek italvi company kii bairata pistaul kharidi
 Nathuram Godse also confessed to the crime of possessing illegal scriptures
 usee sharnaarthi shivi main unhone apana ek chaaya-chitra khinchvaaya or us chitra ko do patron ke saath apane sahyogi narayan apte ko pune bhej diya
 On 30 January 1948, Nathuram Godse reached Birla Bhavan in Delhi 40 minutes before the time of prayer meeting
 jaise hi gandhi prarthana-sabha ke liye parisar main daakhil hue, nathuram ne pehle unhen haath jodakar pranaam kiya uske baad bina koi bilamb kiye apni pistaul se teen goliyaan maar kar gandhi kaa ant kar diya
 Godse made no attempt to escape after that
 nathuram godse par mohandas karamchand gandhi kii hatya ke liye abhiyog punjab ucch nyaayalay main chalaaya gaya tha
 Apart from this, 17 other prosecutions were also tried against him
 kintu itihaaskaaron ke matanusaar satta main baithe log bhi gandhi ji kii hatya ke liye utane hi jimmevaar the jitne ki nathuram godse yaa unke anya saathi
 If considered from this point of view, then Madanlal Pahwa should have been rewarded for this and not punished because he had bombed the same place ten days before the murder case and alerted the government that Gandhi, who was very revered All people used to say Bapu, no longer safe Anyone can go to a prayer meeting and shoot them
 muqadame ke liye nathuram ko sarvapratham punjab ucch nyaayalay main pesh kiya gaya
 He was awarded the death penalty on 8 November 1949 after a trial lasting over a year
 haalaanki gandhiji ke putr, manilal gandhi or ramdaas gandhi dwaara vinimay kii daleelein pesh kii gai thim, parantu un daleelon ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru, maharajyapal chakravarti rajagopalaachari evam uppradhanmantri vallabhbhai patel, teenon dwaara thukraa diya gaya tha
 Nathuram Godse was hanged along with co-accused Narayan Apte on 15 November 1949 in Ambala Jail in Punjab

 After CPR and other diagnostic measures, death is inevitable if the vibratory rhythm is not present
 purnahridarodh ko isiji lay ke aadhaar par "kampan yogya" banaam "gaiyr-kampan yogya" main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Two vibratory rhythms are ventricular fibrosis and non-vibratory ventricular tachycardia whereas two non-vibratory rhythms are cardiac dislocation and non-vibratory electrical activity
 This shows whether a particular class of non-longevity is curable with the use of non-fibroplasia

 purnahridarodh ke nidaan kaa mukhya naidanik maandand parisancharan kii kami he, lekin iskaa nirdhaaran karne ke kai tareeke hai
 Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of sudden cardiac arrest
 kai anya hriday or gaiyr hriday kii sthitiyaan bhi khatre ko badha detii hai
 About 60–70% of SCD is related to coronary heart disease
 vayaskon ke bich, sthanik-araktata hriday rog, purnahridarodh kaa pramukh kaaran he jiske tahat 30% logon ne postmortem main haalia hue rodhgalan ke lakshan dikhaae 
 Several other cardiac abnormalities may increase the risk of SCD including: cardiovascular disease, heart rhythm disorder, hypertensive heart disease, hemolytic heart disease
 18-35 aayu varg ke sainya rangaruton ke ek samooh main, cardiyak visangatiyon ne SCD ke maamalon main 51% kaa yogadan diya, jabaki 35% maamalon main kaaran agyaat bana rahaa
 antarnihit vikruti main shaamil he: coronary dhamni asaamanyataayen, myocarditis or hypertropic hriday-peshi rog 
 raktasanlai hridpaat SCD ke khatre ko 5 guna badha detaa he
 SCD is not related to heart problems in 35% of cases
 sabase aam gaiyr hriday sambandhi kaaran hai: aghat, gaiyr-aghat sambandhit raktasrav, adhimaatra, doobana or phuffusiya ant:shalyata
 The risk factors for SCD are similar to those seen in coronary heart disease, including: smoking, lack of physical exercise, obesity, diabetes, and family history
 ech or tii purnahridarodh he hriday kaa kaaran banataa he sambhav sahaayta main yaad karne ke liye karte the
 Cardiac arrest is synonymous with clinical death
 ek purnahridarodh kaa naidanik nidaan aamtaur par spandan kii anupasthiti se kiya jaataa he
 In many cases carotid pulsing is a gold standard for diagnosing cardiac arrest, but the lack of pulsation may be due to other conditions, or only an error from the rescuer
 Studies have shown that rescuers often make mistakes in examining the carotid pulse in emergencies, whether they are health professionals or ignorant people
 nidaan kii is paddati main ashuddhi ke kaaran, europea rissiteshan council jaise nikaayon ne iske mahatv par baarambaar bal diya he
 The Resuscitation Council has suggested that the technique should only be used by health professionals who have specialized expertise and training, in line with recommendations from the ERC and the American Heart Association, and yet be viewed in combination with other indicators such as sedentary respiration 
 parisancharan kaa pataa lagane ke liye vibhinn anya vidhiyon kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 The recommendations, according to the International Legion Committee 2000 Guidelines on Resuscitation, asked rescuers to see "signs of circulation", but not particularly quivering
 These signs include cough, gasps, complexion, tremors and movement
 However, given the evidence that these guidelines have been ineffective, the current recommendation of the ILCOR is that the diagnosis of cardiac arrest should be made in all casualties who are unconscious and are not breathing normally
 purnahridarodh ke baad sakaaratmak parinaam kii asambhavyata ke kaaran, purnahridarodh ko rokane kii prabhavi ranneeti khojane ke prayaas kiye gaye hai
 Where the main cause of complete heart attack is endemic anemia, it is very effective to promote complete diet, exercise and stop smoking
 hriday rog ke jokhim vaale logon main, rakt daab niyantran, cholestrol kam karnaa or anya chikitsakeey hastkshep ke upaay kiye jate hai
 In medical language, cardiac arrest is referred to as a "code" or a "crash"
 yah aamtaur par aspataal apatkaaleen code par "code blue" ko sandarbhit karata he
 a dramatic drop in life signal measurement is referred to as "coding" or "crashing", although coding is commonly used when it results in complete heart attack, while crashing may not occur
 purnahridarodh ke liye upachaar ko kabhi-kabhi "colling a code" kaha jaataa he
 Extensive research has shown that patients in the general ward often worsen for several hours or days before a heart attack occurs
 iske liye us ward ke karmchaariyon main gyaan or kaushal kii kami ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he, vishesh rup se shwaas dar ke maapan ko kar paane main asafalataa ko, jo aksar haalat main giravat kaa pramukh suchak he or purnahridarodh se 48 ghante purv aksar parivartit hoti he
 In response to this, many hospitals have now increased training for ward-based staff
 ab kai "purv chetavanee" pranali maujuud hai jo jokhim kii us maatra kaa maapan karti he jisame rogi hote hai or yah unke jivan sanketon par aadhaarit hoti he or is prakaar karmchaariyon ko maargdarshan pradaan karti he
 In addition, specialist staff is used more effectively so that the work already done at the ward level is well done
 These include: implantyogy cardeoverter difibrilator, takneekee aadhaarit hastkshep he jo purnahridarodh ko rokane kaa prayaas karata he
 The device is implanted in the patient and acts as an accelerated defibrillator in the event of arrhythmia

 seepiaar kaa ghatak jo sambhavit rup se sabase adhik antar laata he chest compresssont he
 Respiratory intuition has not been found to improve rescue rates in cases of heart attack
 2009 ke ek adhyayan main paaya gaya samarthit ventilation se parinaam tab kharaab ho sakate hai jab niskriy oxigen aapurti vaale maukhik airve ko niyukti kiya jaataa he
 Intuition in the pre-hospital environment has been found to reduce the hope of survival
 sahi dhang se sampadit kiya jaae to baistander seepiaar ko jivan rakshak ke rup main paaya gaya he; aspataal se baahar ke 30% se bhi kam purnahridarodh maamle main sampadit kiya gaya
 The medical community classifies the causes of cardiac arrest as vibratory and non-vibratory causes - based on the presence or absence of ventricular fibrosis or on the ventricular tachycardia of non-pulsation
 Vibrational rhythms are treated by CPR and fibrolysis
 aspataal ke baahar adhikansh purnahridarodh rodhgalan or shuruyaat main nilay sambandhi tantuvikson ke lay ke saath maujuud hota he
 Therefore, the patient reacts to fibroblasts potentially and is the center of intervention
 iske alaava, saarvajanik abhigam tantuvikamphharan kaa prayog bad rahaa he
 Under this, automatic fibroblasts are installed in public places and employees are trained on how to use them
 is tantuvikamphharan kii anumati detaa se pehle apatkaaleen sevaaon ke aagaman ke liye jagah nahin le or he bachane kii sambhaavna bad karne ke liye netritv dikhaaya gaya he
 Some fibroblasts provide feedback on the quality of CPR compression and encourage ignorant rescue workers to press enough to initiate the transmission of blood to the patient's chest
 iske alaava, yah dikhaaya gaya he ki jinhen doordaraj ke kshetron main purnahridarodh hota he unke parinaam purnahridarodh ke baad adhik badtar hote hai: in kshetron main aksar pratham responder hote hai, jahaan samudaay ke sadasyon ko punerjeevan main prashikshan diya jaataa he or ek tantuvikampaharnak diya jaataa he, unke sthaneey kshetra main aakasmik rogi ke liye apatkaaleen chikitsa seva ke liye bulaayaa jaataa he
 Although drug use is included in the guidelines, it has been observed that these hospitals do not show improvement in discharge after complete cardiac arrest
 isamen shaamil he epinephrine, atropine or amiodaron kaa upyog
 adhyayan, haalanki, aspataal ke baahar purnahridarodh ke sandarbh main in dawaaon ke beasar hone kaa ullekh karte hai
 However in its 2010 Guidelines, the American Heart Association only identified atropine and indicated that "available evidence indicates that regular use of atropine during PEA or cardiac arrest has therapeutic benefits
" " The results are improved by normalizing the patient with a return to spontaneous blood circulation without a return to consciousness after cardiac arrest
 is prakriya ko chikitsakeey hypothermia kaha jaataa he
 The first study in Europe focused on those who were resuscitated 5–15 minutes after cardiac arrest
 is adhyayan main bhaag lene vaale marijon ne ausat 105 minute ke baad parisancharan kii sahaj vaapasi kaa anubhav kiya

 These protocols are often initiated with a code blue, which usually indicates an imminent or imminent cardiac arrest or respiratory blockage, although in practice, code blue is often considered less lethal for which immediate supervision of a physician Is required

 chunki OHCA ke maamle main mrityu dar adhik he, jivit rahane kii dar main sudhaar karne ke liye kaaryakramon ko viksit kiya gaya
 Although the mortality rate is higher in case of ventricular fibrosis, prompt intervention with fibroblasts improves the survival rate
 bachane ke asaar zyaadaatar purnahridarodh ke kaaran se sambandhit he
 In particular, patients who have suffered from hypothermia have a higher survival rate, possibly because of the cold, reduced oxygen deprivation effect on the major organs
 vish ke kaaran hone vaale purnahridarodh ke baad jivan raksha dar mukhyatah vish kii pahchaan karne or ek uchit upachaar prashasit karne par nirbhar he

 Pearly penile papules are granular structures seen on the skin of the corona of the penis of the male
 sabhi purushon main is jagah par adrishy dane hote hai lekin kuch logon main ye dane zyada bade ho jate hai
 These large grains are called parley penile papules
 ye bilkul saamaanya sanrachanaayen hoti he
 This is in the same way as the skin of other parts of our body sometimes transforms into mole, wart etc
 inaki vishisht pahchaan yah he ki ye ek yaa ek se aadhik "pankti" main paye jate hai
 They can come up to 3 mm
 inkaa rang mansapeshiyon ke rang ke jaisaa hi hota he
 There is neither any pain, nor any itching nor bleeding in these grains
 inkaa sancharan yon - kriya ke dwaara nahin hota he
 If the doctor is not experienced, he may mistakenly consider it a genital wart
 jabaki yah genital vart se bilkul alag cheez he
 Genital wart is a sexually transmitted disease, whereas peri penile papules are not a disease at all
 yah twachaa kaa ek roopaantar maatr he
 Pearly penile papules are on the penis
 atah jaahir he ki yah sirf purushon main paaya ja saktaa he, mahilaayein isse prabhavit nahin hoti he
 a variety of studies have shown that it is found in most men over 13 years of age
 kuch deshon main 8 % tathaa kuch deshon main lagbhag 48 % purushon ke ling par ye sanrachanaye paayi jaati he
 These structures are found on the gender of 13% of men in America

 Studies have also shown that it is more likely to occur in men who are "uncircumcised"
 parantu iskaa arth katai yah nahin he ki khatna kiye hue logon main yah hota hi nahin | Pearly penile papules are harmless
 arthath inase kisi prakaar kii koi haani nahin hoti he
 It is also not a sexually transmitted disease and does not spread through sexual activity
 inase vyakti ke yon-jivan par bhi koi prabhaav nahin padataa he
 The affected person feels that he has got some disease
 parantu intaraashtriya str par ise rog nahin mana jaataa he
 According to the definition of the World Health Organization, diseases are called diseases, after which a person is unable to perform any specific action
