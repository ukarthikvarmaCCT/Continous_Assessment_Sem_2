 Today Arabs consider this method as their method
 unani paddati kaa aavirbhaav yunaan main hua tha, jisaki vruddhi main anek unani darshanikon kaa, jaise askalipus, woocraat pithagoras, aflatoon, arastu or peeche iskandariyaa ke irophilas, erosistratas or ant main jalinus kaa sahyog praapt hua tha
 Later, Greek learning began to decline
 unani vidya ko romanwaalon ne grahan kar liya, par ve uskaa vikaas kuch nahin kar sake
 Meanwhile, the religion of Islam emerged
 musalmaan shaskaon ne yunaan ke gyaanakosh ko arabi dhaanche main dhaal liya or uski anya deshon ke gyaan vigyaan evam vidyaon se tulana kii
 This led to the collection of knowledge stores of many countries in Arabic language
 ab arabi vidvan pratilipi evam anuwaad kaary se virat hone ke uparaant, gyaan vigyaan ke purna adhikari ban gaye tathaa unke paas ek gyaanakosh sanchit ho gaya
 Then became official and a knowledge base was accumulated with him
 tab aadhikarik rup se inhone in pracheen siddhanton evam samasyaon kaa parishilan, vivechan, mimasaa or anveshan aarambh kiya or unke prayek angopang main vikaas kiya
 In other words, the Greek physician began to wear the dress of the Arabic physician
 arabi vikaas mul gyaanakosh ke saath aisa hill mil gaya ki use pruthak karnaa dushkar evam duruh ho gaya
 The medical texts which were published in the peacetime of the rule of the Arabs proved to be of such high quality that scholars from all Western and Eastern countries accepted such texts as text books
 yunaan main vaidyak gyaan kaa prasar misr or phinishia dwaara hua
 Much of Ayurveda was learned by Buddhist monks from India, or from Syria and Babylonia Hakar, went to Egypt, went from Egypt to Yunnan, or went to Iran via Iran and spread from there to Arab and other Western countries
 aadhunik paashchaatya vaidyak vigyaan kaa aadhaar bhartiya ayurveda hi he or allopathy kaa mul mantra bharat se hi gaya
 In fact, both Unani and Ayurvedic medicine are found in modern allopathy
 bharat kii chikitsapaddati pracheen kal main adhik samrudh or unnat thi
 It also has a clear impact on the Chinese medicine system
 unani vaidyak ke aadharbhoot siddhant, arkan arbaa or arbalaat arbaa aadi, aryavaidyak main bahut pehle se sthir ho chuke the or inhen chaturmahabhoot, yaa panchmahabhoot or chaturdosh, yaa tridosh aadi naamon se jaanate the
 In the said period itself, many Indian liquids and principles were eclipsed in the texts of Bucharat, Dioscorides and Jalenus etc
 muvashshir evanfaatik ne mukhtarul hukum main likhaa he jab sikandar ne daara par vijay pai, to usne iraniyon ke samast granth nasht kar diye, keval jyotish, darshan or vaidyak ke granth chhod die, jinka uske aadesh se unaneey bhashaantar kiya gaya
 Probably, the Greeks also came from India in the same way
 sikandar ke akraman ne unaniyon tathaa bharatiyon ke bich sambandh paidaa kar diya tha
 The inevitable result of this union was that the Greeks learned legal science from Indians
 baad main bhi yah sambandh iran, syria or iskandariyaa se bana rahaa
 Dr
 Hornley and Dr
 Newberg have written that two Greek Hakim named Tegias and Megasthenes came to India in search of knowledge from the 4th century CE
 yah kaaran he ki uttarkalin unani granthon main branpuran kii bhartiya vidhiyon kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Through Greek texts from the Greeks, many nations of Europe, Asia and Africa learned this discipline and became popular everywhere
 unani-roosi-samskruti ke haas ke pashchaat gyaan or vidya ke saath vaidyak kii dharohar bhi musalamaanon ke haath main ai jinhone ise balakh, bokhaara, turkistan, china or bharat se lekar andlus tak failaayaa
 In the early period of Islam, although its guardians were Muslims, it remained in the hands of other castes
 lagbhag dedh sau varsho tak unani chikitsa paddati ko isai, yahudee, tarapujak, irani, kuldani, misri or surayani aadi vibhinn bhashabhashi jatiyaan jaananevaali thim
 When these texts were translated into Arabic, the Muslims began to learn this discipline, then many world-renowned, like Raji and Sheikh emerged
 unani chikitsa ke aadharbhoot siddhant nimnlikhit he: Ilmetib is the scripture which gives knowledge of healthy and unhealthy states of human body and this scripture explains how health can be protected and how can disease be prevented in the condition of disease
 manushya kaa swasthya un tatwon kii prakritik or aprakritik sthiti par nirbhar karata he jinase maanav sharir bana he
 These elements are called Umur Mukbwema, or Azazai Mukwavema, a Greek physician
 manushya kaa astitv inhin tatwon par nirbhar he
 As long as these elements remain in their natural state, the human body performs its work regularly
 isi kaa naam swasthya he
 The origin of human nature depends on these basic elements, if there is not one of these elements, then the condition of human body will become impossible
 umoor tabiiyya ko hi ayurveda main dosha-dhaatumal-vigyaan or allopathy main phiziology kehete hai
 Umur Tabiyya consists of seven elements: ye hi sharir ke kool ghatak, yaa upadan he jinase manushya bana he
 Ilm is the representation of these substances in Manafedlaja
 unaniyon ne sharir ke sanghatnkaaree samast padaartho ko do pradhan bhaagon, dravyabhoot or adravyabhoot, main baanta he adravyabhoot ghatak dravya nahin he
 This is their property from the shelter of liquid components
 inhen chhod dene par dravyabhoot ghatak keval chaar thaharte hai, jinamein arkan dravyibhoot ghatakon ke bhi nirmaayak moolbhoot tatv hai
 On leaving it, only three liquid components, Akhalat, Aza and Arwah are left
 unaniyon ne sharir ke samast sanghatnkaaree tatwon ko swaroop kii drushti se teen virgo main baanta he: Shaykhurais has given a detailed account of all the outstanding subjects of the Greek physician and his organ suffixes in the early chapters of his well-known treatise, Al Law
 is granth main yah bhi batayaya gaya hai ki hakim ko kin kin bishyon ko kitna jaananaa aavashyak hai tathaa kin bishyon main pratyaksh, anubhav evam pareekshan apekshit hai
 The second crop of Sheikh Sir Kulliyat's law is the form in Moujat Tib: 'chookin unani vaidyak shaastra swasthya or aswasthya kii drushti se maanav sharir kaa nirupan karata hai or prayek vastu kaa gyaan usee samay purnataya praapt kar liya jaay, basharte ki us vastu ke kaaran kaa hon, iske liye yah aavashyak hai ki unani vaidyak shaastra main swasthya or aswasthya ke hetu, unke kaaran gyaat kiye jaae
 Since health and their diagnosis are sometimes individual and manifest, and sometimes latent and latent, which cannot be known from the senses, there is a requirement of guiding the nuisance and symptoms for their knowledge, so it became inevitable that the Greeks In Vaidya Shastra, the nuisances and symptoms that occur in health and unhealthy should be mentioned
 We are able to identify health and unhealthy disease
 ulum hakikia main aisa kaha hai ki kisi vastu kaa gyaan uske nidaan kaarnon se praapt hota hai
 If his diagnosis is not the cause, then knowledge of his personal symptoms can be detected to some extent
 unani grantho main asbagh ke chaar bhed bataae gaye hai
 These are: Asbab Maddia, Asbab Faliya, Asbab Suriya and Asbab Tamamiya, or Gaia
 basbaab maddiya se swasthya evam rog adhishthit hote hai

 sannikrusht nidaan ang pratyang, oj evam vaayu hen or viprakrusht nidaan chaturdosh or chaturmahabhoot hai
 Upholstery phallia are the factors that change, or protect, the human body
 asbab suriya ke teen upbhed he: 1
 prakruti, 2
 bal or 3
 sanghathan 
 External health is found by staying in the nature, force and organization
 in teenon main se kisi ek ke vikrut hone se rog hota hen
 Asabas are all body movements
 sutara unani vaidyak main nimna vishyon kaa pratipaadan kiya jaataa he : mahabhoot prakruti, dosha, abhishravayav, sanmishravayav, praan or oj, bal, swasthyay evam aswasthya or tanmadhyavarti halaat, aswastha drusht, yaa shareerik avasthaa main or adholikhit nidaan kaaran khaadya, peya, vaayu, jal, desh tathaa sthaan, sansaadhan, stambhan, vyavsaay, swabhaav, kayika evam maansik kaary, acarya, vibhinn vaayu lingabhed, sharir par aane vaale anya bhra vishay, swasthya sangrakshan, prayek vyaadhi ke nivaranarth khaadh evam peya kii vidhi, cheshtaa acheshtaa kaa anumaan, aushadhsewan, hastkarm evam shalyakarm se laabh uthaanaa
 Of these, there are some that Hakim must accept without reasoning and there are some who have to prove by logic and logic
 vaidyak shaastra main kuch vishay anya shastron se grahan kiye gaye hai, aise vishyon kaa swaroop tark evam yukti ke bina sweekaar kar lenaa vaidya ke liye anivaary hai
 The organ suffixes and their deeds are known by knowledge and the cremation and surgery
 shaikh kehete hai, jin vishyon kaa jaananaa or jinaki vaidyak main tark evam yukti se siddh karnaa aavashyak hen, ve rog, unke nidaan kaaran or unke lakshan he tathaa yah he ki vyaadhi kaa nivaaran kis prakaar kiya jaae evam swasthya sangrakshan kis prakaar ho saktaa hai
 These topics are such that among them, whose existence is not clear and definite, it is necessary to prove them in detail with time and evidence - alphabetical reasoning and logic
 shaikh ke vivaran se hamen jahaan unani vaidyak ke samast pratipaadyon evam sidvanto kaa sankshep main gyaan ho jaataa hai, vahaan is vishay kaa bhi gyaan hota hai ki in pracheen vidwaanon ke paas pratyaksh gnanarth us praarambhik evam saral yug main jo jo upkaran uplabdh the, unase apni shakti evam samarthy bhar kaam lene main in audyogikon ne koi baat uthaa nahin rakhi hai
 Changing Kapitya Siddhanto and arriving at different conclusions of different investigators at different times is a free rule
 paashchaatya vaigyanik vishyon ke sambandh main bhi aisa sadaa hi hota aa rahaa hai
 What was once considered irrefutable truth, has been proved untrue many times by new means, tools and discoveries
 pratyaksh gyaan ke baad bhi bhuyodarshan karne waalon se bhul hona sambhav he, to is niyam se pracheen vidwaan bhi nahin batch sakate hai
 They studied and inspected the laws of nature according to their ability
 pratyaksh prayog yaa anubhav ke baad kuch nishkarsh sthir kiye, unamem se kuch peeche ke prayogon or anubhavon se mithyaa siddh hue
 With this we cannot blame those ancient scholars
 shaikhurais ke anusaar vyaadhi kaa pratikaar hetuvyaadhivipareet dwaara hi kiya jaataa hai
 It is treated as wizard

 عالمگیر There are two Dayanand in the history of India: sheeghra gir jane ko shighrapatan kehete hai
 In the case of sex, the term is used for ejaculation
 purush kii ichha ke viruddh uskaa veery achaanak skhlit ho jaae, stri sahavaas karte hue sambhog shuru karte hi veerypat ho jaae or purush rokna chaahakar bhi veerypat hona roak na sake, adhabich main achaanak hi stri ko santushti va tripti praapt hone se pehle hi purush kaa veery skhlit ho janaa yaa nikal janaa, ise shighrapatan hona kehete hai
 This disease does not belong to the woman, it is only with the man, and this disease is only with the man
 sheeghra patan kii sabase kharaab sthiti yah hoti he ki sambhog kriya shuru hote hi yaa hone se pehle hi veerypat ho jaataa he
 There should be no definite measure of the duration of sexual intercourse, that is, how long ejaculation should not take place
 yah prayek vyakti kii maansik evam shaareerik sthiti par nirbhar hota he
 Premature ejaculation is premature ejaculation
 yah “samay” koi nishchit samay nahin he par jab “entry” ke saath hi “exit” hone lage yaa stri-purush abhi charam par na ho or skhalan ho jaae to yah shighrapatan he
 In such a situation, it is possible to have dissatisfaction, defamation, inferiority complex, negative thoughts and tension in relationship with your partner
 yahan yah samaj lenaa jaruri he ki jaruri nahin he ki har vah vyakti jiskaa veeryaskhalan sheeghra hota he shighrapatan kaa shikaar he
 It may be that the individual is suffering from some physical anomaly and this problem is permanent, but for this, consultation with a good expert is necessary
 intercorse shuru hone se 60second ke bheetar hi agar kisi purush kaa veery-skhalan ho jaataa he to ise sheeghra-patan kaha jaayegaa
 Experts of the International Society of Sexual Medicine have defined this early degeneration for the first time


 
the report also states that 30% of men worldwide are troubled by this sexual condition
 sheeghra patan kii sabase kharaab sthiti yah hoti he ki sambhog kriya shuru hote hi yaa hone se pehle hi veerypat ho jaataa he
 There should be no definite measure of the duration of sexual intercourse, that is, how long ejaculation should not take place
 yah prayek vyakti kii maansik evam shaareerik sthiti par nirbhar hota he
 During sex, take a long breath for some time
 yah prakriya sharir ko atirikt urja pradaan karti he
 You should know that one time sex consumes about 400 to 500 calories of energy
 isliye agar sambhav ho sake to bich-bich main twarit urja dene vaale taral padaarth jaise glucose, zeus, doodh aadi kaa seven kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, mutual interaction can also give you stability

 Someshwar became the king of Shakambhari after Prithvi Bhatt's death and after his death, according to Abul Fazal, Nagarjuna, the nephew of Prithviraj Tomar, the king of Delhi, for some time ascended the throne of Shakambhari, hence the conflict between Prithviraj Chauhan and Nagarjuna in 1177 AD Happened

 They said- yah gyaan to naveen anusandhan tathaa bhavi kriyakalapon kaa armbh maatr hota he
 He saw the decline and fall of three characteristics of Indian talent - spirituality, prolificness and intelligence - in today's education system

 Concept of Arvind's education system - Arvind wanted this type of education that would expand the student's field of knowledge, which would develop the memory, decision-making and creative ability of the students and the medium of which was the mother tongue

 shri arvind ke anusaar "shiksha kaa pramukh lakshya vikasshil aatma ke sarvageen vikaas main sahaayak hona tathaa use ucch aadarshon ke liye prayog hetu sakasham bananaa hai
 "arvind's ideas are similar to the goals of education propounded by Mahatma Gandhi
 arvind kii dharna thi ki shiksha kaa uddeshy vyakti main yah vishwaas jaagrit karnaa he ki maansik tathaa atmik drushti se purna sakasham he tathaa vah shanai: shanai: atimanav kii sthiti main aa rahaa he
 Education should be the supreme development of the inherent intellectual and moral abilities of the individual
 arvind kaa vishwaas tha ki maanav daivi shakti se samanvit he or shiksha kaa lakshya is chetana shakti kaa vikaas karnaa he
 That is why they considered the brain as the 'sixth sense'
 shiksha kaa prayojan in chha: gyanendriyon kaa sadupyog karnaa sikhaanaa hona chahie
 He had said that "there should be complete training to the highest extent of the brain, otherwise the child will remain incomplete and single
 at: shiksha kaa lakshya maanav-vyaktitv ke samekit vikaas hetu atimanas kaa upyog karnaa he
 " shiksha ke paathyakram ke vishay main aravind chaahate the ki anek vishyon kaa satahi gyaan karaane kii apeksha vidhyaarthiyon ko kuch chaynit vishyon kaa hi gahan adhyayan karaayaa jaye
 He considered Indian history and culture to be an integral part of the curriculum because he thought that every child had a sense of history which is revealed through fairy tales, games and toys
 at: baalkon ko abhiruchi apane desh ke sahitya evam itihaas ke prati viksit kerani chahie
 According to Arvind, every person has a tendency to inquire, discover, analyze and synthesize
 at: ve vigyaan ko paathyakram main sthaan dete the
 Through science, human understands the natural environment and comes discipline for the development of objective intelligence
 mastishk ko pradhanta dene ke kaaran aravind paathyakram main manovigyaan vishay ko bhi sammilit karnaa chaahate the jisase ki `samgr jivan-drushti' viksit ho sake
 For this purpose, he also gave philosophy and logic in the curriculum
 aravind balak ke bauddhik vikaas ke saath uskaa naitik evam dharmik vikaas bhi karnaa chaahate the
 His belief was- "human mental instinct is based on moral instincts
 bauddhik shiksha, jo naitik va bhaavnaatmak pragati se rahit ho, maanav ke liye hanikaarak he
 "for moral education, Arvind was in favor of Guru's ancient Indian tradition in which the Guru could be a friend of the disciple, a pioneer and a guide
 anushaasan dwaara hi vidhyaarthiyon main acchhee aadaton kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 Moral should be given through "communication method" in which the Guru motivates students for moral development by example of personal ideal life and ancient great men
 aravind ke anusaar shikshan ek vigyaan he jiske dwaara vidhyaarthiyon ke vyavhaar main parivartan aana anivaary he
 In his words- "the first principle of real teaching is that it is not possible to teach anything, ie nothing should be imposed on the learner's brain from outside
 shikshan prakriya dwaara shikshaarthi ke mastishk kii kriya ko thik disha deni chahie
 "every student should be educated according to personal aptitude and ability
 vidhyaarthee ko apni pravriti arthath "swadharm" ke anusaar vikaas ke avasar milane chahie
 Arvind considered 'manas', ie the sixth sense brain, whose emphasis was on development
 viksit maanas se 'sookshm drushti' utpann hoti he jisase nishpaksh drushtikon viksit hota he
 The goal of teaching ‘chitta Shuddhi’ through yoga should be
 aravind kii drushti main vahi shikshak prabhavi shikshan kar saktaa he jo uparokt vidhi se vidhyaarthee kaa vikaas kare
 Help educated students to develop their supervision, attention, judgment and memory through proper use of knowledge and brain
 shikshan baalkon kii tark shakti ke vikaas dwaara unamem antardrushti utpann kare
 Arvind used to show the importance of teacher and said that- ashok panagadia ko chikitsa ke kshetra main utkrisht yogadan ke liye 2014 main bharat sarkaar ne padmashri se sammanit kiya
